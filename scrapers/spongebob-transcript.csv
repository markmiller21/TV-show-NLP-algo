12,SpongeBob,2," [SpongeBob walks outside, and breathes in the fresh air] Ahh, what a wonderful day. The sun is out, the water is shimmering, scallops are chirping. So peaceful. [SpongeBob immediately grabs wood, a hammer, and some nails, and starts to noisily build a stand. Squidward peeks his head out the window]
",1
13,Squidward,2," Can we lower the volume, please? I can't work with all that racket going on!
",1
14,SpongeBob,2," Oh, sure thing, Squidward.
",1
15,Squidward,2," Yes. Mmm. Right. Mmm.
",1
16,SpongeBob,2," Okay. [he taps on a nail lightly, and he looks up at Squidward's window. He does it again, and continues to, making sure he doesn't make too much noise. Meanwhile, in Squidward's house, Squidward has his clarinet in hand]
",1
17,Squidward,2," And now... for some soothing sounds from Squidward's clarinet. Thank you, thank you. [He starts to play. SpongeBob looks up and sees that Squidward is playing, so he decides to finish his stand quickly. Squidward looks out the window again.]
",1
18,Squidward,2," I thought I... Wha?
",1
19,SpongeBob,2," Hey, Squidward! Wanna blow some bubbles? Only 25 cents.
",1
20,Squidward,2," Oh, right. Like I would spend a moment of my time blowing bubbles.
",1
21,SpongeBob,2," Uh huh!
",1
22,Squidward,2," Oh, please! I mean, who in the world would pay to blow bubbles? [Patrick is comes out of his house, stuck to the underside of the rock]
",1
23,Patrick,2," Good morning! [he falls and screams]
",1
24,Squidward,2," Oh, boy. [Patrick walks over to SpongeBob]
",1
25,SpongeBob,2," Good morning to you, sir. Would you care to blow a bubble?
",1
26,Patrick,2," Hmm, how much is it?
",1
27,SpongeBob,2," Only a quarter.
",1
28,Patrick,2," Sounds reasonable. [whispering] Uh, I'm going to need to borrow a quarter.
",1
29,SpongeBob,2," Sure thing, Patrick. [he pulls out a quarter and he gives it to Patrick]
",1
30,Patrick,2," Ah, one quarter. [he hands the quarter back to SpongeBob, and bites it to see if it's real]
",1
31,SpongeBob,2," Thank you. [cuts back to Squidward]
",1
32,Squidward,2," Hmm, business is booming. [he laughs] How did I ever get surrounded by such loser neighbors? Uh huh. [he continues playing. Cut back to SpongeBob and Patrick. SpongeBob dips the wand in the bubble soap]
",1
33,SpongeBob,2," One bubble wand, dipped and ready to go. [Patrick grabs the wand from SpongeBob, inhales deeply and begins to blow, but a bubble doesn't come out. He pants and blows again. After a while, SpongeBob puts up a ""Lessons"" sign. Patrick then loses his breath] Could I interest you in some lessons? Only 25 cents.
",1
34,Patrick,2," Uh, very well, then. Hey, Sponge, can I borrow another quarter? [SpongeBob hands Patrick a quarter] Thanks. [he winks and hands the quarter back to SpongeBob]
",1
35,Patrick,2," Oooh. [SpongeBob pops out of nowhere and blows a box. Patrick giggles and SpongeBob blows a caterpillar] Ah! [The caterpillar then pops one-by-one, with descending sounds. Patrick continues to giggle. SpongeBob blows a boat, and it floats off, pops, and makes a foghorn noise. Cuts to inside of Squidward's house]
",1
36,Squidward,2," Huh? [he shakes his clarinet. Cut back to outside with SpongeBob and Patrick]
",1
37,SpongeBob,2," And now... with two hands! [he inhales deeply and blows out an elephant. Circus music, in particular part of the piece ""Entry of the Gladiators"", starts playing.]
",1
38,Patrick,2," [Laughs] It's a giraffe! [Patrick continues laughing as the elephant floats over into Squidward's house. SpongeBob then frowns as the bubble pops and tons of smaller bubbles come out of both windows of the house while an elephant sounds. Squidward opens the door with a sour look on his face. SpongeBob and Patrick hide behind the stand. SpongeBob places a ""Closed"" sign on it. Squidward looks over the stand]
",1
39,SpongeBob,2," Excuse me, sir, but we are clo-
",1
40,Squidward,2," Don't give me any of that! How can you two possibly make all this noise just blowing bubbles?!
",1
41,Squidward,2," That's not art. That's just annoying. Blowing bubbles, that's the lamest idea I have ever heard. [SpongeBob and Patrick, now depressed, head to SpongeBob's house] You should be ashamed of yourselves. [SpongeBob closes the door as Squidward laughs to himself] Bubbles. [he continues laughing] Art. [he mumbles, and picks up the bubble wand, sniffs it, and inhales to blow. Then, SpongeBob pops up out of nowhere]
",1
42,SpongeBob,2," That'll be 25 cents, sir.
",1
43,Squidward,2," Ah, whoa, what? [SpongeBob blinks] Oh... who-who would pay 25 cents to blow bubbles?
",1
44,SpongeBob,2," We also offer lessons for beginners. [he puts the ""Lessons"" sign up]
",1
45,Squidward,2," Beginners? What could be more simple than blowing a stupid bubble? [he pulls a quarter out] Here's your 25 cents! [SpongeBob bites it to see if it's real and it bends] Watch and learn. [he inhales and blows, but nothing happens] Uhh... wait, wait, wait. [he inhales and blows again, but nothing happens again] One more time. Here. Wait. [he inhales and blows again, and a small bubble comes out and instantly falls to the ground and bursts, making a raspberry sound. Looks over at SpongeBob and Patrick. They gulp, and then start whistling. Squidward places another quarter on the stand] Uhh... Just a mere warm-up. [he dips the wand in the bubble container, inhales deeply and blows hard. The bubble falls to the ground again, making another raspberry sound, gets another quarter out and puts it on the stand]
",1
46,SpongeBob,2," Hey, Squidward, remember the technique. [Squidward keeps trying to blow bubbles while SpongeBob and Patrick are trying to show him the technique]
",1
47,SpongeBob and Patrick,2," [while standing on one foot] Technique! Technique! Technique! Technique! Tech- [Squidward looks at them]
",1
48,SpongeBob,2," [weakly] You're not doing the technique.
",1
49,Patrick,2," Technique.
",1
50,Squidward,2," Technique? Technique!? Technique, technique, technique, technique, technique! [he starts to do the infamous routine, while imitating SpongeBob] First I do this, spin around. Stop. Double take three times. And here we go, pelvic thrust. Wehooooo! Wehoohoo! Oh, stop on your right foot, don't forget it. Then, bring it around town. And a little of this, a little of that, a little of this, this, this, this, that, that, that, that. And that, that, that that that that! And then... [Screams into the wand, blowing a gargantuan, unshaped bubble]
",1
51,SpongeBob and Patrick,2," Wow! [Squidward is then lifted off the ground. The bubble pops off the wand and Squidward falls back on the ground]
",1
52,SpongeBob,2," All right, Squid! That was so good!
",1
53,Patrick,2," Squid is number one!
",1
54,Squidward,2," I really did it, didn't I? Hey, you guys didn't blow anything like that! 
",1
55,SpongeBob,2," No.
",1
56,Squidward,2," Now that's a bubble!
",1
57,SpongeBob,2," You said it, Squidward. See, it is all in the technique!
",1
58,Patrick,2," Yeah, technique.
",1
59,Squidward,2," Technique? Hah! SpongeBob, you don't think I created that [kisses his tentacle] beautiful work of art with your help? [he starts laughing] Come on, it's in my genes.
",1
60,SpongeBob and Patrick,2," Squid's got genes! Squid's got genes! [Squidward walks back to his house]
",1
61,Squidward,2," Thank you, thank you, thank you. [he starts to play his clarinet. SpongeBob and Patrick chant Squidward's name. At one point, they belly flop each other and Patrick falls on the ground.] I rock. [Squidward continues to play his clarinet. As SpongeBob and Patrick continue to chant, Squidward's bubble flies over them, covers the house, and pulls it out of the ground and up towards the top of the ocean. SpongeBob notices and stops Patrick]
",1
62,SpongeBob,2," [concerned] Squidward! [Patrick now notices]
",1
63,SpongeBob and Patrick,2," Squidward! Squidward! Squidward! [Squidward stops playing his clarinet]
",1
64,Squidward,2," Hello, my friends. You are looking at a... [he sees how far he is from the surface]
",1
65,SpongeBob and Patrick,2," Squidward!
",1
66,Squidward,2," ...genius. [the bubble explodes in the air and then the ground violently rumbles and shakes. SpongeBob and Patrick look in awe]
",1
67,SpongeBob and Patrick,2," Wow! [the ground stops shaking. The two slowly walk back to their homes. They then speed up and run inside their houses. Squidward's house floats back to the surface. He starts playing his clarinet weakly to the Thankfulness song as the screen fades black, ending the episode]",1

They fall into a heap in front of Squidward's house. The jellyfish stings both of their backsides and flies off. Just then, Squidward comes out of his house with his bike]
",1
75,Squidward,3," Hm.
",1
76,SpongeBob,3," Hey Squidward, we're jellyfishing.
",1
77,Squidward,3," Of course you are. Bye now. [walks off]
",1
78,SpongeBob,3," Wait! We made a net especially for you! [holds it up] Do you want to come with us?
",1
79,Patrick,3," Patrick.
",1
80,Squidward,3," Right. But I can't. Bye bye.
",1
81,SpongeBob,3," Next time?
",1
82,Squidward,3," Oh sure, right! Whatever. [bikes away; under breath] Like that'll ever happen.
",1
83,SpongeBob,3," You know, Patrick? It always seems like Squidward never has time for fun.
",1
84,Patrick,3," Maybe he doesn't like us.
",1
85,SpongeBob,3," No, are you kidding? We're his best friends. [Squidward bikes down a path, cuckling to himself]
",1
86,Squidward,3," Jellyfishing. [laughs, as he laughs, his nose inflates and deflates] Oh, I'll go. [laughs] I sure had them going. [laughs. But, he doesn't see a jellyfish which is going in the opposite direction. He keeps on laughing. The jellyfish ends up swimming in Squidward's mouth and he coughs it out] Stupid jellyfish! Beat it! [he hits it, and the jellyfish goes up his shirt and starts zapping him. Squidward's legs get tangled on the pedals and he trips on a rock. He bounces down a hill and then falls down a jagged rocky cliff. He reaches the bottom of the cliff and immediately an atomic explosion appears. He groans silently.]
",1
87,SpongeBob,3," Squid's back! [he phones Patrick, which causes the screen to split diagonally, revealing Patrick on the bottom]
",1
88,Patrick,3," Yello?
",1
89,SpongeBob,3," Hey Patrick, Squid's home! And we're gonna make sure he's greeted by his two best friends!
",1
90,Patrick,3," Oh great! Who are they? [it's revealed that the two are phoning each other from across the room, just with different wallpapers]
",1
91,SpongeBob,3," Us! [the two hang up] Let's go! [Squidward wheels himself into his house. The lights suddenly turn on, and SpongeBob and Patrick blow party horns. SpongeBob and Patrick are inside his house with a banner that says ""Welcome Home""] Welcome home, Squidward!
",1
92,Patrick,3," Merry Christmas!
",1
93,SpongeBob,3," We're gonna make this your best day ever! [Squidward turns around and wheels out. SpongeBob rolls him back in] Well, your best day's sure not gonna be out there. [SpongeBob wheels Squidward to a table where Patrick stands by a bowl of soup]
",1
94,Patrick,3," How about some soup on your best day ever? [Squidward looks at the soup and sees Alphabet Soup letters spelling out, ""Best Day Ever"" Patrick holds up a spoon] Here we go! [he scoops some up, but Squidward makes some grunting noises in refusal] Oh, it's a little hot. [he blows on the spoon, sending steaming hot soup splashing all over Squidward's bandaged face. Patrick notices his spoon is empty and refills it to blow on, covering Squidward in more hot soup. This continues for three times until SpongeBob pulls the soup bowl away and laughs nervously]
",1
95,SpongeBob,3," I don't think soup is the best thing for him on his best day ever. [walks near a music stand and Squidward's clarinet] How about some music on your best day ever? Played on your very own clarinet. [he blows into it, but wind comes out causing Squidward to groan] Sorry, my lips are a little dry. [He wets his lips exaggeratedly long and wet. Just when he prepares to blow, Patrick snatches the clarinet away]
",1
96,Patrick,3," Music isn't best either!
",1
97,SpongeBob,3," But what is best is what we saved for last. The one sure-fire thing to make your best day ever the best day ever! [cut to SpongeBob, Patrick and Squidward in Jellyfish Fields. SpongeBob and Patrick hold nets]
",1
98,SpongeBob and Patrick,3," [chanting] Jellyfishing, jellyfishing, jellyfishing, jellyfishing, jellyfishing, jellyfishing, jellyfishing, jellyfishing, jellyfishing!
",1
99,SpongeBob,3," This is Jellyfish Fields, where wild jellyfish roam just waiting to be captured. [Squidward rides away, but SpongeBob catches him] No, no, Squid! Over here! I know you're eager, but you don't even have your net. Pat, fix him up while I find him a good specimen.
",1
100,Patrick,3," Firmly grasp it in your hand. [he places the pole end on Squidward's bandaged hand, but it falls because he can't grab, Patrick picks it up] Firmly grasp it. [he does it again and the results are the same, making Patrick angry] Firmly grasp it! [he forcefully jabs the net through Squidward's bandaged hand. Squidward lets out a muffled pained scream] That oughta do it. [SpongeBob spots a jellyfish]
",1
101,SpongeBob,3," There's one in position. Ready... set... go! [the two yell out words of encouragement to Squidward and jump up and down, but Squidward isn't budging. The two eventually notice Squidward isn't going anywhere. They again encourage him, but still nothing happens]
",1
102,Patrick,3," I think we gotta show him how it's done. [in the tune of ""The Beautiful Blue Danube,"" SpongeBob and Patrick dance along next to the jellyfish and try to catch it. SpongeBob and Patrick sing, and even the jellyfish hums out some music. After several attempts, they get into a big fight with stinging and such. The jellyfish escapes the squabbles and swims by Squidward and stings him on the nose. Squidward, mad, goes after the jellyfish. SpongeBob and Patrick, still getting stung by jellyfish, notice]
",1
103,SpongeBob,3," Hey look! Squid's doing it! [as Squidward chases, SpongeBob and Patrick cheer him on. His wheelchair is stopped by a rock, but he eventually gets back on track. The jellyfish lands on a pink ""rock"" and Squidward catches it. He laughs triumphantly, but muffled due to the bandages and whacks the net against the ""rock"". The ""rock"" surfaces, revealing to be a really huge jellyfish, the Queen Jellyfish. She now floats above Squidward. Squidward gulps. SpongeBob and Patrick look on.]
",1
104,Patrick,3," This guy's good.
",1
105,SpongeBob,3," He's a natural!
",1
106,SpongeBob,3," [Simultaneously cheering] Yeah, you're doing great Squidward!
",1
107,Patrick,3," [Simultaneously cheering] Yeah, you got it Squidward! Yeah, you're doing it Squidward! See who'd you been missing?
",1
108,SpongeBob,3," [Simultaneously cheering] Yeah, you got Squidward! You got it Squidward!
",1
109,Patrick,3," [Simultaneously cheering] You got what you wanted, Squidward! You can do that distance! Use that net!
",1
110,SpongeBob,3," Be the net!
",1
111,Patrick,3," Yeah! You're feeling it Squid! That's it, all the way! The last 6 miles, make that Squid! Go, go, go!
",1
112,SpongeBob,3," [Simultaneously] Yeah, go by the eye of the tiger, by the eye of the tiger, by the eye of the tiger! Better, better, better! Yeah, yeah, yeah! You've got it now!
",1
113,Patrick,3," It's in the bag!
",1
114,SpongeBob,3," This is really your best day ever, isn't it?
",1
115,Both,3,"  Oooh...
",1
116,SpongeBob,3," Hey, Patrick. Well... [sighs] Thought yesterday went... [hesitates] pretty well, don't you think?
",1
117,Patrick,3," I had fun.
",1
118,SpongeBob,3," Me too. [some whirring is heard in the background]
",1
119,Patrick,3," Here comes Squidward!
",1
120,SpongeBob,3," Oh, great. [Squidward comes rolling down the path in a stretcher and in a cast] Hey Squid! How about that... [Squidward rolls down the front walk in a wheeled medical bed with a container of life-saving fluid. Squidward appears with lots more bandages.] ...best day ever?
",1
121,Patrick,3," There's always tomorrow! [Squidward's bed bangs on the door, trying to get in]
",1
122,SpongeBob,3," Um, we're really sorry about what happened yesterday, Squidward. [he bangs the door again] Um, we got you a present! [it's the jellyfish that caused Squidward to encounter the Queen Jellyfish in a jar] It's the jellyfish. [Squidward scowls]
",1
123,Patrick,3," You know, from yesterday!
",1
124,SpongeBob,3," You're not still mad, are you? [Squidward opens the jar towards SpongeBob and Patrick]
",1
125,Patrick,3," Yup, he's still mad. [The jellyfish chases after SpongeBob and Patrick and stings them. Squidward laughs to himself. The Queen Jellyfish returns and zaps him again. Now he's burnt to a crisp. The cast cracks off, leaving a completely blackened Squidward]

SpongeBob whispers into a bubble and it floats over to Patrick and pops]

155,Squidward,4," [Laughs at Patrick. Puts the soufflé and fork in his mouth.] [Continues laughing.

[he takes a deep breath and performs CPR on Squidward. As he is doing this, each one of Squidward's tentacles suction cups pops up. Eventually, the fork comes out and Patrick catches it] I win!

235,Squidward,4," Sorry, boys, I'm all out of pop. I'm gonna go get some more. [walks away] Why don't you just stay here and chat? [closes door. Then we see SpongeBob and Patrick. They are extremely fat and not wanting to look at each other. Then SpongeBob hiccups and a bubble floats up and pops that sounds like a burp. Both of them laugh and the entire house is full of bubbles as Squidward walks up to his door with a grocery bag. Then an explosion and crashing sounds are heard] I should just walk away right now. [opens door to find his house destroyed] What a surprise... I invited them in, and I left them alone. Well, Squidward, what have we learned today? [pieces around the door break]
",1
236,SpongeBob,4," Guess what, Squidward? [both hug]

239,SpongeBob,4," Don't you want us to help you clean this up a little?
",1
240,Squidward,4," NO! Out! [both walk out]
",1
241,SpongeBob,4," Psst, I think he's jealous.
",1
242,Patrick,4," How pathetic. [Squidward shuts door hard and when he turns around as a bubble comes and pops on the door which causes the door to fall on his back]

294,SpongeBob,5," [SpongeBob and Squidward are now in a place with heavy winds] The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza for you and me. The Krusty Krab pizza [Squidward's nose touches his face so he puts it down, only for it to touch his face again so he puts it in his mouth] is the pizza free delivery. The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza very ta-asty. [SpongeBob gets carried around in the air by the huge winds]

306,SpongeBob,5," No!
",1
307,Squidward,5," SpongeBob! [looks down] Hang onto the pizza! [tornado spits them both out. SpongeBob uses the pizza as a parachute but Squidward falls hard onto the ground] Hey! Hey! [crawls up to the screen] Where's the road? Where's the road? [a tumbleweed rolls by] We're doomed! How are we gonna get home, which way do we go? [SpongeBob lands] What are we gonna do now! There's no road here!
",1
308,SpongeBob,5," I think town's this way. [points]
",1
309,Squidward,5," Oh, don't tell me, Jethro. The pioneers?
",1
310,SpongeBob,5," That's right. [points to a mossy rock] Moss always points to civilization.
",1
311,Squidward,5," That way? That way there? [SpongeBob nods] So, let me get this straight... you think that we should go that way?
",1
312,SpongeBob,5," [nods again] Yep.
",1
313,Squidward,5," Well, then I'm going this way. [heads the other way]
",1
314,SpongeBob,5," Huh? Squid, wait! I don't think...
",1
315,Squidward,5," Trust me, I know where I'm going. [Pans out to show another city in the other direction]
",1
316,SpongeBob,5," [sings] The Krusty Krab pizza absolutivally. [later] pizza... [starts beatboxing] pizza... [later, SpongeBob is walking backwards. SpongeBob's pants almost split into two and move up and down simultaneously while he continues to beatbox. Still later] Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza, yeah, for you and [falsetto] me! [later] Krab Pizza... for you. Krus... the Krusshy and the... Krab and the... pizza inside. [Later, they are both lying face down in the sand]
",1
317,Squidward,5," Sponge, we gotta eat something.
",1
318,SpongeBob,5," I heard in times of hardship, the pioneers would eat coral. [Squidward eats some coral] No, maybe it wasn't coral. [Squidward spits out the coral] Maybe it was sand, no, no, mud.
",1
319,Squidward,5," Give me the pizza!
",1
320,SpongeBob,5," Wait, I remember now. It was coral!
",1
321,Squidward,5," Give it to me!
",1
322,SpongeBob,5," No, we promised it's for the customer.
",1
323,Squidward,5," [fancy music plays] You're right. It's for the customer.
",1
324,SpongeBob,5," Yeah!
",1
325,Squidward,5," Maybe we better check on it, make sure it's okay.
",1
326,SpongeBob,5," Well?
",1
327,Squidward,5," Just a peek. [opens box]
",1
328,SpongeBob,5," [he shuts it quickly] Okay, it's fine.
",1
329,Squidward,5," No, I think I saw something. [opens box] Oh, no. I was wrong. It looks okay. Sure is a fine looking pizza.
",1
330,SpongeBob,5," Yeah.
",1
331,Squidward,5," What's that? Is that the cheese?
",1
332,SpongeBob,5," Yeah!
",1
333,Squidward,5," And the pepperoni?
",1
334,SpongeBob,5," Yeah!
",1
335,Squidward,5," [SpongeBob slurps] Oh, looks good, huh?
",1
336,SpongeBob,5," Wait a second, I know what you're trying to do, Squidward. [closes box] I'm not letting you eat the pizza!
",1
337,Squidward,5," Give me the pizza!
",1
338,SpongeBob,5," No!
",1
339,Squidward,5," Don't make me take it away from you, SpongeBob!
",1
340,SpongeBob,5," Get away!
",1
341,Squidward,5," [chases SpongeBob] Get back here, SpongeBob, give me the pizza!
",1
342,SpongeBob,5," No!

343,Squidward,5," SpongeBob!
",1
344,SpongeBob,5," No!

",1
349,Squidward,5," I want that pizza and you're gonna hand it over one way or another!
",1
350,SpongeBob,5," Look, we're saved!
",1
351,Squidward,5," Sure, we're saved. Now give me some pizza!
",1
352,SpongeBob,5," No, really Squid, we're saved! We're saved! We're saved! [he jumps in and out of his pants]
",1
353,Squidward,5," Will you cut that out?!
",1
354,SpongeBob,5," [to a conga beat] Saved, saved, saved, saved! Saved, saved, saved, saved, saved, saved! [rips himself apart then the two parts go in circles and then they connect again. SpongeBob starts doing a conga dance] Saved, saved, saved, saved, saved, saved! Saved, saved, saved, saved, saved, saved! Saved, we are saved!
",1
355,Squidward,5," That's just a stupid boulder!
",1
356,SpongeBob,5," It's not just a boulder. [sniff] It's a rock. [cries] A rock! A rock! Its a big beautiful, old rock. [climbs up it and rubs it] Oh, the pioneers used to ride these babies for miles, and it's in great shape.
",1
357,Squidward,5," SpongeBob, will you forget the stupid pioneers?! Have you ever noticed that there are none of them left? That's because they were lousy hitchhikers, ate coral and took directions from algae! And now, you're telling me they thought they could drive... [SpongeBob runs over Squidward with the boulder] ...rocks? Hold on there, Jethro!
",1
358,SpongeBob,5," [they stop outside the customer's house] I can't wait to see the look on our customers face! [rings doorbell]
",1
359,Tom,5," Yeah?
",1
360,SpongeBob,5," Congratulations, sir. Your Krabby Patty pizza is here!
",1
361,Tom,5," Wow, thanks! I've been dying for one of these. It... [brief pause] Where's my drink?
",1
362,SpongeBob,5," [confused] What drink?
",1
363,Tom,5," [in an angry tone] My drink!? My diet Dr. Kelp. Don't tell me you forgot my drink!
",1
364,SpongeBob,5," [checks through the order] But, you didn't order any...
",1
365,Tom,5," [yelling] How am I supposed to eat this pizza without my drink?!
",1
366,SpongeBob,5," But... but... [tears start rolling down his face]
",1
367,Tom,5," Didn't you ever once think of the customer?! [throws the pizza at SpongeBob's face] You call yourself a delivery boy?! Well I ain't buying! [slams door. SpongeBob goes over to Squidward, smiling and trying not to cry]
",1
368,Squidward,5," Sponge? Sponge? It's okay. Sponge? [SpongeBob drops the pizza, falls over, starts sobbing, and absorbs his tears over and over] Sponge? [Squidward gets angry, grabs the pizza, stomps towards the Customer's house and pounds on the door]
",1
369,Tom,5," [answers the door, still angry] Another one? Look, I told your little friend I ain't paying for that!
",1
370,Squidward,5," [Tom's point of view] Well, this one's on the house! [slams the pizza in Tom's face, knocking him out]
",1
371,SpongeBob,5," [still crying] Did he change his mind?
",1
372,Squidward,5," [smugly] He sure did. Ate the whole thing in one bite.
",1
373,SpongeBob,5," [stops crying] No drink?
",1
374,Squidward,5," Nah. Now take me home. [jumps up on the rock]
",1
375,SpongeBob,5," Are you kidding? We have just enough time to make it back to work. [backs up the rock where they are instantly at the Krusty Krab]

376,Squidward,5," Work? [screen cuts to black] Oh, my aching tentacles!",1

419,Mermaid Man,6," Uhh, are they here to fix the TV?

421,SpongeBob,6," Are you Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy?
",1
422,Barnacle Boy,6," Well, we used to be. But now we're retired.
",1
423,SpongeBob,6," But you can't retire! There's evil afoot.
",1
424,Mermaid Man,6," Wha? Evil! Evil! [hanging on a flower] Barnacle Boy! Don't forget there's evil!
",1
425,SpongeBob,6," All I said that there was evil afoot.
",1
426,Mermaid Man,6," Evil! Evil! E...
",1
427,Barnacle Boy,6," Would you please stop saying that?
",1
428,Mermaid Man,6," [hanging on a water fountain] EVIL! EVIL, EVIL, EVIL, EVIL, EVIL! [water squirts at him] Disgraaace! [manager comes, grabs and throws SpongeBob and Patrick out]
",1
429,SpongeBob,6," Wow, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.
",1
430,Patrick,6," It's too bad they're old.
",1
431,SpongeBob,6," What do you mean, Patrick? Old people are the greatest. They're full of wisdom and experience. [real life captain gives a thumbs up and the Jurassic Park theme plays] The world needs Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. Someone, somewhere, is in trouble, and I won't rest until Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy are out of retirement. [fireworks appear]
",1
432,Patrick,6," Ooh! Pretty lights!
",1
433,Mermaid Man,6," To the meatloaf! To the broccoli! Make sure you give extra broccoli to my young ward. The boy needs his vitamins.
",1
434,Cafeterian,6," Here you go, son. Haha.
",1
435,Mermaid Man,6," To the table, away!
",1
436,Barnacle Boy,6," Careful! Don't run!
",1
437,SpongeBob,6," Hey, Mermaid Man.
",1
438,Mermaid Man,6," Uh, here comes the TV repairman.
",1
439,Barnacle Boy,6," What do you want from us?
",1
440,SpongeBob,6," Hold on. Just let me look at ya.
",1
441,Mermaid Man,6," Stay alert, Barnacle Boy. He... he's up to something.
",1
442,Barnacle Boy,6," Will you cut... will you stop calling me ""boy?""
",1
443,SpongeBob,6," Do you remember the time the food supply in Atlantis was running low? So you invented a ray gun that makes things grow six times their size to shoot at the kelp gardens. But then the evil Man Ray swoops down and swipes the gun away and shoots all the algae. [jumps onto one of the cafeteria tables where somebody is eating] And he globs onto the undersea dome. [puts his mouth on the table] And he starts sucking on the glass.
",1
444,Barnacle Boy,6," What's your point, kid?
",1
445,SpongeBob,6," You guys are the greatest heroes of all time, and I think you should come out of retirement.
",1
446,Mermaid Man,6," Listen up, you villains. I wanna eat my meatloaf. If you don't get out of here, then by the power invested in me, I now pronounce you man and wife.
",1
447,Manager,6," [enters the cafeteria] What is going on in here?
",1
448,Mermaid Man,6," [points to SpongeBob, who stops smiling] You may kiss the bride! [SpongeBob gets kicked out and rolls home]
",1
449,Patrick,6," Did you re-unite our heroes?
",1
450,SpongeBob,6," No, but I'm married. [Back at the retirement home]
",1
451,Mermaid Man,6," Up, up, and away. Up, up, and away.
",1
452,SpongeBob,6," [dressed up as a woman] Oh, my. This purse is so big and heavy.
",1
453,Patrick,6," [dressed up as a robber] Hold it right there, ma'am. I'll be taking that. [grabs SpongeBob's purse]
",1
454,SpongeBob,6," [screams] Hay-lp! Hay-lp! Hay-lp!
",1
455,Patrick,6," It's working.
",1
456,SpongeBob,6," [Barnacle Boy comes over to him] Why, are you here to rescue little ol' me?
",1
457,Barnacle Boy,6," [yells at SpongeBob, ruining his makeup] Pipe down! You could wake Mermaid Man and he's ornery when his nap is disturbed.
",1
458,SpongeBob,6," [approaches Mermaid Man, who is sleeping with his eyes open] Ever alert, Mermaid Man has trained himself to sleep with his eyes open.
",1
459,Barnacle Boy,6," Confound it, get away from him!
",1
460,Mermaid Man,6," [wakes up] Stop shoutin'! I'm nappin'!
",1
461,Barnacle Boy,6," [close up to his face] It's not me, you ol' coot!
",1
462,Retired Elderly #1,6," Yes.
",1
463,Retired Elderly #2,6," That's me.
",1
464,Retired Elderly #3,6," I'm over here.
",1
465,SpongeBob,6," Excuse me, Mermaid Man.
",1
466,Mermaid Man,6," What do you want?
",1
467,Barnacle Boy,6," This better be good.
",1
468,SpongeBob,6," This'll cheer you up. We're almost done painting your invisible boatmobile. [The invisible boatmobile is shown almost completely covered in black paint and we also see Patrick smiling while holding a paintbrush with black paint on it.]
",1
469,Barnacle Boy,6," Gah! It's supposed to be invisible! That's it! We gotta end our life of leisure. It's time to come out of retirement. There's evil afoot.
",1
470,Mermaid Man,6," Evil! Where is it?
",1
471,Barnacle Boy,6," There it is! [points at SpongeBob and Patrick] You know what this means? [opens up box with shiny rings]
",1
472,Mermaid Man,6," Donuts!
",1
473,Barnacle Boy,6," Oh, brother. [puts ring on Mermaid Man and then they put them together, but it doesn't work, so they do it again, but it doesn't work] Say the oath.
",1
474,Mermaid Man,6," [in his young voice] Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, unite! [they put the rings together, and this time it works] Throw a waterball at 'em!
",1
475,SpongeBob and Patrick,6," Waterballs! Waterballs! [Barnacle Boy throws a waterball at SpongeBob, but nothing happens]
",1
476,Patrick,6," Hehehehehe.
",1
477,Barnacle Boy,6," Mumbling mories. It's not working, Mermaid Man.
",1
478,Mermaid Man,6," He-he's-he's absorbing it like some kind of evil sponge!
",1
479,Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy,6," Dogpaddle away! [they swim around SpongeBob and Patrick]
",1
480,Patrick,6," It's the Raging Whirlpool. [SpongeBob and Patrick cheer as the whirlpool consumes them]
",1
481,Mermaid Man,6," Those fiends. They're actually enjoying it.
",1
482,SpongeBob and Patrick,6," Do it again! Do it again! Do it again!
",1
483,Barnacle Boy,6," Now what, Mermaid Man? We need help!
",1
484,Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy,6," Sea creatures, unite! [they summon the sea creatures but they are retired so they come slowly]
",1
485,Barnacle Boy,6," Hmm, the creatures of the deep seem to have lost some of their luster.
",1
486,Mermaid Man,6," Sea creatures, attack!
",1
487,SpongeBob,6," Pinch me, I must be dreaming. [sea creatures pick up SpongeBob and Patrick] Mission accomplished, Patrick.
",1
488,Patrick,6," Yeah, we did it. [sea creatures throw them out]
",1
489,Mermaid Man,6," I did it. I feel five years younger. Oh, it's good to be back!
",1
490,Barnacle Boy,6," We did it, you ol' coot. [they shake hands]
",1
491,Mermaid Man,6," Who are you? [Barnacle Boy becomes annoyed]
",1
492,TV Announcer,6," The New Adventures of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy! We join our heroes locked in a battle of wits. [Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy play checkers.]
",1
493,Mermaid Man,6," It's the Aquaphone! [he holds the phone upside down] What is it, Chief? Uhh, hello? Hello? Hello? [Hangs up phone. ""HANG UP!"" appears] The phone is still broken. Remind me to g-get that fixed. [""SIT!"" appears]
",1
494,Barnacle Boy,6," Remind you of what?
",1
495,Mermaid Man,6," Remind me of what?
",1
496,TV Announcer,6," Will our heroes ever get their phone fixed? Tune in next week and find out.
",1
497,SpongeBob,6," Wow. That was even better than the old show.
",1

506,Mrs. Puff,7," Everyone, put down your books, because it's time to pick out the hall monitor of the day! [SpongeBob squeezes his pencil so hard it shoots up into the air] Let's see here. This weeks hall monitor will be Bart, Jimmy, no, no, Tina, Ralph, mm... [gasps] ...SpongeBob. [SpongeBob moves his desk between 2 rows] It's Jimmy! Jimmy's the hall monitor.

",1
515,SpongeBob,7," Yahoo! Hall monitor SpongeBob reporting for duty, ma'am! I am ready to assume my position... in the hall! I will protect all that are weak... in the hall! All rules will be enforced... in the hall!
",1
516,Mrs. Puff,7," Okay! Just take the hat and belt. [tries handing him uniform]
",1
517,SpongeBob,7," I can't accept that yet, ma'am. First I have to make my speech.
",1
518,Mrs. Puff,7," You can't make this easy, can you?
",1
519,SpongeBob,7," Classmates! Who am I to deserve such a great honor? Why, I would be nothing without Mrs. Puff.

[clock moves forward in time as SpongeBob continues his speech] ...crime and punishment, punishment and crime in the hall! [at this point almost everyone , is asleep ] Which reminds me of an extremely long speech written by the greatest hall monitor of all time. [takes out a long roll of paper] ""Friends, students, juvenile delinquents, lend me your ears."" [the clock has disappeared, and it is now much later in the day. Puff is asleep at her desk] In conclusion, and without a moment to spare, I will put on this uniform [takes out the hat and belt] and assume my duties as... [puts on the uniform] ...hall monitor!

",1
531,SpongeBob,7," Broken traffic light! Who's to say my monitor duties should end just because the bell rang? I can be helpful anywhere! This looks like a job for the hall monitor! [directs traffic, with a whistle, to their destination using all sorts of hand gestures but ends up causing a huge wreck in the end] What would this town do without you, SpongeBob?

532,Fred,7," My leg! My leg.

544,Patrick,7," Sorry, officer.

545,SpongeBob,7," Sorry's not good enough, Patrick. You've committed a crime, and I'm taking you in.

548,SpongeBob,7," [reads paper] Maniac. Bikini Bottom? Car wreck? Break-in? Who better to bring this maniac to justice than me, the hall monitor! But I can't handle this case alone. Patrick, are you ready to give up your life of crime?
",1
549,Patrick,7," [still crying] I wanna be good!
",1
550,SpongeBob,7," Hmmm... now you just need a symbol of authority. [Patrick puts the ice cream cone on his head] Perfect! It is our duty to catch this maniac and bring him to justice! But how to proceed? Listen, deputy, you're an ex-criminal. What would you do?
",1
551,Patrick,7," Hmmm... I'd get an ice cream! [both walk out an ice cream store with ice cream]
",1
552,SpongeBob,7," Okay, now what?
",1
553,Patrick,7," Hmmm... [both come out the ice cream store again with ice cream]
",1
554,SpongeBob,7," This isn't working. We've got to do something else. Something with walkie-talkies! [takes out two walkie-talkies. Patrick grabs one and is elated with joy] And now, duty calls! Alright deputy, I'll go that way, you go some different way! Run em out! [SpongeBob runs off sounding like a siren. The police come driving up and stop beside Patrick]
",1
555,Officer Rob,7," Afternoon, son.
",1
556,Patrick,7," Hello, brothers. [salutes to the officers, then raises both eyebrows whilst pointing to his hat]
",1
557,Officer Rob,7," Son, we're looking for the maniac.
",1
558,Officer John,7," Have you seen this man?! [Officer #2 whips out a poster that says WANTED MANIAC with SpongeBob's picture on it.]
",1
559,Patrick,7," [screams] It's the maniac! Take him away! Take him away!
",1
560,Officer Rob,7," Calm down, son. It's just a drawing, not the real thing. Now we're gonna show you this picture again, and you tell us if you've seen this guy, understand?
",1
561,Patrick,7," Yeah, uh huh.
",1
562,Officer Rob,7," Okay. [Officer John shows Patrick the poster again]
",1
563,Patrick,7," [screams] Horrible!
",1
564,Officer John,7," [Puts picture away. Shows Patrick the poster again.]
",1
565,Patrick,7," [Screams again. Both officers then look at each other and smile. Officer John repeatedly takes away and shows the poster to Patrick as he screams every time. Eventually, the officers think they've had enough fun.]
",1
566,Officer Rob,7," Stay indoors, son.
",1
567,Officer John,7," And, uhh, take that cone off your head. [both laugh as they drive off]
",1
568,Patrick,7," [takes out walkie-talkie] SpongeBob? Come in, SpongeBob. Answer.
",1
569,SpongeBob,7," SpongeBob here, Patrick. Report.
",1
570,Patrick,7," [over walkie-talkie] I don't wanna be a policeman anymore! I'm scared!
",1
571,SpongeBob,7," Get a hold of yourself, deputy.
",1
572,Patrick,7," [over walkie-talkie]'[crying] I wanna go home!
",1
573,SpongeBob,7," Poor rookie. Alright, I'm on my way back.
",1
574,Patrick,7," Hurry SpongeBob, I think it's getting... [the bright sky suddenly, becomes dark] ...dark.
",1
575,SpongeBob,7," Just put on your siren and I'll be right there.
",1
576,Patrick,7," Wee-woo. Wee-woo. Wee-woo. Wee-woo. [Patrick picks up the poster that the officers showed him earlier. Then sees a darkish figure down the road. It's SpongeBob but Patrick doesn't realize it] Wee-woo! Wee-woo! Wee-woo! SpongeBob! I see him!
",1
577,SpongeBob,7," [over walkie-talkie] Where is he, Patrick?
",1
578,Patrick,7," [over walkie-talkie] At the intersection of Conch and Coral. [SpongeBob turns his head around to read the street sign]
",1
579,SpongeBob,7," That's where I am. He's right on top of me, but I can't see him! What's he doing?
",1
580,Patrick,7," Uhh, he's just standing there... menacingly! [screams over walkie-talkie] Get out of there, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob screams] That's his maniac shriek. He's going to attack! [SpongeBob cries while running around in circles] He's acting all crazy! Run! Hide behind that building! [SpongeBob hides behind the building] No, he's behind that building! Oh, quick, hide behind that street sign! [SpongeBob hides behind the street sign] No wait! The maniac just went behind that sign! Quick! Get under the street light! [SpongeBob gets under the street lights] No wait, he's there, too! Run for your life! [SpongeBob jumps inside a mailbox. As he tries to relax, the radio is cutting out]
",1
581,SpongeBob,7," [over walkie-talkie] Say again, deputy?
",1
582,Patrick,7," The maniac's in the mailbox! [SpongeBob screams and bursts his arms and legs through the mailbox and runs through buildings and eventually through a fence]
",1
583,SpongeBob,7," [takes a look at the wanted sign] Huh, this guy's not half-bad-looking for a maniac. Wait a minute, Patrick, I'm the maniac! [Patrick screams and a bunch of police cars surround SpongeBob]
",1
584,Officer Durado,7," We'll take that as a confession. [Mrs. Puff appears]
",1
585,Mrs. Puff,7," SpongeBob SquarePants, there you are! I turn my back on you for one minute and you destroy half the city! You should be ashamed of yourself!
",1
586,Officer #1,7," You know this guy?
",1
587,SpongeBob,7," [frowns nervously] Yes, Mrs. Puff?
",1
588,Mrs. Puff,7, I'd like to see you after class. Six months from now. [jail closure sound],1

627,SpongeBob,8," Alien repellent? Let me see that. [looks at the can] New Alien-Out Window Protectant. Does not stop burglars. Well, I guess you're right, Patrick. We'd better go spray those windows! [SpongeBob and Patrick walk up to the rocket]
",1
628,Patrick,8," Look how big it is, SpongeBob!
",1
629,SpongeBob,8," It's pretty impressive, all right.
",1
630,Patrick,8," Come on! [both head for the rocket]
",1
631,SpongeBob,8," We're just here to spray the windows, Patrick!
",1
632,Patrick,8," Wow. How do you think we get inside? [pulls a level that says ""open""]
",1
633,SpongeBob,8," We don't, we're just spraying the... [door opens on SpongeBob] ...windows.
",1
634,Patrick,8," I opened it, SpongeBob! Come on! [both walk inside] Holy seacow, SpongeBob. This must be the control room.
",1
635,SpongeBob,8," Yeah, Just don't touch anything. [Patrick starts playing with everything]
",1
636,Patrick,8," Look, I'm winning!
",1
637,SpongeBob,8," Patrick, cut that out! Patrick, come on, we can't hang around in here. This is Sandy's big rocket, not some kind of a fun... [SpongeBob turns around and looks at himself as thin in the mirror] ...house?
",1
638,Patrick,8," Woo-hoo! Winner! Yeah! High score!
",1
639,SpongeBob,8," Hey, Patrick, what game was that, anyway?
",1
640,Patrick,8," I don't know! [notices a lever above his head] But let's see what this does!
",1
641,SpongeBob,8," Patrick, I don't think we should... [Patrick pulls a lever and the two launch off the seat out of the rocket]
",1
642,Patrick,8," I like rockets. [both fall back into the rocket]
",1
643,Patrick,8," More! More!
",1
644,SpongeBob,8," No more! [Patrick presses a button and both shake a lot then stop] Okay, one more. [shake again] Okay, that's enough. Let's go.
",1
645,Patrick,8," Oh, wait, I think this one starts it. [SpongeBob stops Patrick from pushing a button]
",1
646,SpongeBob,8," Patrick, what are you doing? I'm the space traveler here and I happen to know that that particular button is right over here. [presses the engine button and the ship starts up and is blasting off]
",1
647,Patrick,8," We've started the rocket!
",1
648,Sandy,8," [notices the smoke] Oh, SpongeBob... [SpongeBob and Patrick hold onto each other while the ship is taking off]
",1
649,Patrick,8," Hold on, buddy! [while screaming, SpongeBob and Patrick are falling down to the bottom of the ship. The ship enters space and both of them start to float] Hey, we stopped falling!
",1
650,SpongeBob,8," Look! [points at the dark galaxy] We're in space now! Whee! [both float around in the ship]
",1
651,Patrick,8," Hey! Whoa! Somebody get me down, or up, or something! [SpongeBob laughs as the ship is going around the moon] Hey, SpongeBob, watch this! [squirts toothpaste into some peanut butter]
",1
652,SpongeBob,8," Hey! You got your toothpaste in my peanut butter! [SpongeBob lifts a heavy weight] Patrick, I can do this! [the ship is landing back into the sea and the heavy weight hurls into the ground and flattens SpongeBob's hand]
",1
653,Patrick,8," Hey, who turned the heavy back on?
",1
654,SpongeBob,8," We must be landing.
",1
655,Patrick,8," All right! [Sandy uses her jetpack to fly up to the moon]
",1
656,Sandy,8," Sometimes that SpongeBob is as dumb as a sack of peanuts. [the ship is now in Bikini Bottom. While Sandy searches for SpongeBob and Patrick on the moon, these two get out of the ship]
",1
657,Patrick,8," Wow, it sure looks a lot like home. [Patrick sees Gary asleep] Hey, look, it's Gary! Come here, Gary. Gary!
",1
658,SpongeBob,8," Wait, don't go near it, Patrick! Can't you see this is all a trick? The aliens are projecting our memories onto the environment! They're trying to confuse us, Patrick.
",1
659,Patrick,8," So you mean to say they've taken what we thought we think and make us think we thought our thoughts we've been thinking our thoughts we think we thought? I think...
",1
660,SpongeBob,8," Okay, but I'm not gonna to fall for it! [SpongeBob captures Gary with a gray net-like substance] Yeah!
",1
661,Patrick,8," You got him, SpongeBob! Won't Sandy be proud.
",1
662,SpongeBob,8," Sandy. I forgot about her. She's gonna hate us for stealing her rocket. But won't she feel silly when I bring home a real live alien? Aww, she'll love me! [grabs Gary] Come on, Patrick, the more, the merrier! [tosses Gary into the ship. Ship's number increases from 00 to 01; ding from ""The Price Is Right""]
",1
663,Patrick,8," Alien hunting! Alien hunting!
",1
664,SpongeBob,8," Shh, quiet, Patrick, don't let them know we're onto them! Uhh, yeah, alien hunting. I saw that on TV, too. Gee Patrick, let's drop in on our old pal Squidward and see what he's up to. [whispering to Patrick] Make sure your gun is pumped. [go in and see Squidward sleeping] Look at it, Patrick, it's disgusting. [Squidward moves his arms and legs around then puts them back down] It's even uglier up close. Let's begin the analysis. [SpongeBob takes the covers off]
",1
665,Patrick,8," Wait, what's that? [SpongeBob takes a red bag out from underneath Squidward. It appears to be a urine absorbing pad] I think I'm gonna be sick.
",1
666,SpongeBob,8," Patrick, do you know what this thing is?
",1
667,Patrick,8," Stinky.
",1
668,SpongeBob,8," No, it's an egg sac! Let's look at the embryo. [Patrick puts flashlight under the so-called ""egg sac"" and SpongeBob's hands are under it]
",1
669,SpongeBob and Patrick,8," Twins. [Squidward rolls over in his sleep and his right tentacle sticks on Patrick's helmet]
",1
670,Patrick,8," Pardon my French but get this thing off me! [SpongeBob and Patrick try to get his tentacles off but they wake him up instead]
",1
671,Squidward,8," Patrick and SpongeBob? Get out of my bedroom! And give me back my tentacles!
",1
672,Patrick,8," It's awake!
",1
673,SpongeBob,8," Let's capture the little phony! [Squidward screams]
",1
674,Squidward,8," Get away from me! [runs away while SpongeBob and Patrick try to capture him. Outside, Mr. Krabs walks up with his pet worm and notices Squidward's house shaking. SpongeBob and Patrick come out with Squidward captured]
",1
675,Mr. Krabs,8," Ahoy, there, lads! Up a bit late to be playing pirate, aren't ye? [laughs. SpongeBob and Patrick points their guns at his head] Wait! Don't shoot. Okay, okay, shoot me, but don't take me money!
",1
676,SpongeBob,8," We don't want your money, moon man! [both capture Mr. Krabs and toss him and Squidward into the ship] Look at them squirming around in there.
",1
677,Patrick,8," Eww, gross.
",1
678,SpongeBob,8," Well, there's plenty more where those came from. [at Boating School]
",1
679,Mrs. Puff,8," [grading some of her students' paper] SpongeBob, what are you doing here so late? [captured] Whatever this is... [inflates herself and has a deep voice] ...it's going on your permanent record! [Flats, a woman, and Larry are captured along with all of Bikini Bottom. SpongeBob and Patrick are run out of room in the ship for everyone]
",1
680,Patrick,8," SpongeBob, I think we might have to make a second trip.
",1
681,SpongeBob,8," There's no time for that! Just push harder. [Sandy is on her jetpack floating down]
",1
682,Sandy,8," SpongeBob, what are y'all doing? I can't turn my back on you for two seconds without you causing a whole mess of trouble. Why look at ya, bagging up all your friends and neighbors just like they were a fresh crop of hickory smoked sausages. You darned turned my little science experiment into a disaster. You two oughta should be ashamed of... [SpongeBob and Patrick capture her]
",1
683,SpongeBob,8," Nice try, Sandy.
",1
684,Patrick,8," Or should I say Ms. Alien Pants. [laughs]
",1
685,Sandy,8," Aliens? Is that what this is about? [SpongeBob and Patrick throw her into the ship] This isn't the moon! We're still in Bikini Bot-- [door is slammed shut]
",1
686,Patrick,8," I didn't even know!
",1
687,SpongeBob,8," Yeah? Well, I got you now.
",1
688,Patrick,8," Oh, but it's not you that's got me, it's... [Patrick catches himself with the gray netting] ...me that's got me!
",1
689,SpongeBob,8," Boy, I can't wait to see the look on Sandy's face when she sees this! [ship runs out of gas and stops on the moon] Sandy, I'm back! [peeks out the window] Wow, Bikini Bottom sure looks different. [sees the Earth] Uh-oh...

",1
707,Mr. Krabs,9," Ah, SpongeBob, you wouldn't last even one day in the wild. This is your natural habitat. [shows kitchen] This is your wide open range. [shows grill] These are your amber waves.

",1
720,SpongeBob,9," Oh, oh, Sandy. That's exactly the response I would expect from someone who lives the sham of a life I once lived. I'm gonna prove I don't need all this stuff to be happy.

",1
738,SpongeBob,9," Well, that's over. Back to jellyfish matters. [a drop of jelly lands on SpongeBob nose. He samples it] Mmm, jelly. [eats a lot of jelly as the jellyfish come back toward the hive] Ah, my jellyfish brethren are returning. [jellyfish buzz into the hive] Greetings, comrades! [the jellyfish repeatedly shock SpongeBob and he screams. SpongeBob climbs out of the hive and runs as the jellyfish keep shocking him. Later, SpongeBob is in a cave] Being a jellyfish sure is fun. Buzz. [rips off a bushel of grass] Buzz. [pushes rock over as he uses it for his pillow] Buzz. [pushes the rock aside and gets cold. The blanket scrunches up but SpongeBob pushes it back down. Blanket scrunches up again and SpongeBob gets cold] Hey! Eww, I'm itchy! Itchy, why am I so itchy! Ahhhhh! [takes off the blanket and reveals 9 poison sea urchins] Poison sea urchins!

Buzz. [buzzes 14 more times as he walks up to the Krusty Krab door and sees a plate full of Krabby Patties on a table] Krabby Patties. [walks past Sandy's treedome then he cries] Sandy. [still buzzing, walks up to his pineapple] What have I done? I had a great life and friends, and I gave all of that up. [opens door and turns the light on.

793,SpongeBob,10," So, this is what it feels like... the big time! With this mop, I shape my destiny! [show starts and crowd applauds. Squidward comes out and gets the cue cards that are in his tuxedo]
",1
794,Squidward,10," Good evening and welcome to the 1st annual Squidward Tentacles Talent Show. Sponsored by the Krusty Krab, home of the Krabby Patty, because no one else would give it a home. [Patrick laughs] Thank you. Our next act is living proof that nepotism is alive and well. [Patrick laughs again] Put your fins together for... [Patrick cracks up laughing very hard. Bashes on the table with laughter, shaking dinnerware. He falls off his chair] Put your... [Patrick laughs] Put... [Patrick laughs] Pearl. [crowd claps as curtain rises for Pearl, dressed in cheerleader uniform]
",1
795,Mr. Krabs,10," Hooray! My little girl is finally a star.
",1
796,Pearl,10," Give me a K-R-U! [jumps up and down on the stage causing the crowd to fly up and down with her] Give me a S-T-Y! [jumps up and down again] Krusty Krab! [jumps up and down] Krusty Krab! [jumps up and down] Krusty Krab! [jumps up and down]
",1
797,Mr. Krabs,10," [Mr. Krabs, Patrick, and SpongeBob's parents get tossed up and down. Mr. Krabs appear happy.] That's what I call talent! [Krusty Krab floor is destroyed]
",1
798,Pearl,10," Thank you! Thank you, thank you! [Squidward closes curtain and as he is lowering the rope, SpongeBob is tied to it holding a mop and a bucket of water.]
",1
799,Squidward,10," [Screams in shock]
",1
800,SpongeBob,10," Hey Squidward, listen, what do you think? When I mop, should I go forward and back? No, no wait, side to side. [Squidward lets the rope go and sends SpongeBob flying up. Then he walks back out on the stage]
",1
801,Squidward,10," And now, poetry. [walks backstage but peeks his head through the curtain] By Gary. [curtain opens. Gary is on a stool]
",1
802,Gary,10," [clears throat] Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow.
",1
803,Sandy,10," He has such a way with words.
",1
804,Squidward,10," [checks his watch] Come on, come on, Ginsburg, if he doesn't hurry it up, we're not going to have time for the best act... me! [SpongeBob walks up]
",1
805,SpongeBob,10," Squidward, should I use Mr. Cleanser or Dr. Clean?
",1
806,Squidward,10," Yes. [audience applauds as curtain opens revealing Plankton in a magician costume and a sign that says 'The Amazing Plankton!']
",1
807,Plankton,10," I, the amazing Plankton, with the use of prestidigitation... [turns his wand into flowers] ...will make a Krabby Patty disappear before your very eyes. [throw the flowers aside] First, I'll need a volunteer from the audience. [jumps onto a table and grabs the Krabby Patty from the customer. Runs toward the door but Mr. Krabs stops Plankton]
",1
808,Mr. Krabs,10," Nice try. Your act's over, bub. [grabs the patty]
",1
809,Plankton,10," You may win this time. She-hah-kazeek! [he claps his hands and ignites into a mini-explosion. The smoke from the explosion clears and he is completely charred] Well, this stinks. [he walks off and is booed. Mr. Krabs runs up to Squidward backstage, leaving a trail of flames]
",1
810,Mr. Krabs,10," Squidward! [Literally races towards him, like an overspeeding race car] This show is a disaster! You're ruining me!
",1
811,Squidward,10," Now, now, don't you worry, Mr Krabs. I've saved the best for last, you'll see.
",1
812,Mr. Krabs,10," For your sake, I hope you're right. [bunch of spot lights gleam around Krusty Krab]
",1
813,Squidward,10," And now, ladies and gentlemen, the moment you've all been waiting for. We've saved the best for last. Put your hands together for the incomparable Squidward! ['Squidward Live' words blink in pink and green lights. Curtain opens and the background shows a canyon. Squidward dances with birds, accompanied by classical music. Then the lights go dark and music becomes techno as Squidward dances weirdly. Makes weird noises as he dances after the first part of his dance.]
",1
814,Fish,10," What the?!
",1
815,Mr Krabs,10," I'm losing money on this deal! [puts a $1.00 sticker over the free sign on the salad bar. Grins.]
",1
816,Fred,10," It's worth every penny. [everyone runs up to Mr. Krabs with dollar bills in hand]
",1
817,Squidward,10," You bottom feeders! You don't even know talent!
",1
818,Crowd,10," No talent! No talent! No talent! [curtain closes]
",1
819,SpongeBob,10," Hey Squidward, can I go on now?
",1
820,Squidward,10," Yeah, show's over! [crown continues booing as SpongeBob walks out and mops up the tomatoes. Crowd gets interested in this and applauds at him]
",1
821,Crowd,10," Hey, yeah. That's really not bad. I like that. Alright! [SpongeBob briefly stops mopping and the crowd becomes silent. He then starts mopping faster getting even more applause. He then leaves stage right and the applause stops. He peeks from where he left and mops the floor while leaving stage left which starts the applause again. He waves goodbye to the crowd]
",1
822,Squidward,10," They want an encore! [pushes SpongeBob away] Stand aside, SpongeBob! [Squidward jumps out and the crowd grows silent. He goes backstage and SpongeBob comes back out mopping and crowd cheers again. SpongeBob leaves stage left as Squidward jumps out again and the crowd instantly becomes silent again. Squidward is angry.]
",1
823,Mr. Krabs,10," You did it, Squidward! What a great show!
",1
824,Mrs. SquarePants,10," Oh, my son's a star!
",1
825,Mr. SquarePants,10," Who ever knew he had such talent.
",1
826,Mr. Krabs,10, I'll be needing another wheelbarrow for next week's show! [crowd throws flowers at SpongeBob],1

856,TV,11," With Anchor arms! [puts a long pink item on his arm] They slip on like a glove. Just add air. [puts a plug in the arm's hole and pumps air into it] How big do you want 'em? [pumps air into other arm] Normal? [puts more air into arm] Veiny? And for the ladies... [puts air into arm which makes it grow hair] ...hairy. [SpongeBob whistles as the TV puts up an image of a weak shark] I was a wimp before Anchor arms. Now, I'm a jerk and everybody loves me. So order now, wimp!

",1
890,SpongeBob,11," Yeah, your workout routine wasn't quite tough enough for me.

924,SpongeBob,11," [tries to pull the anchor but instead he falls under the ground with the anchor and comes out and laughs] Just kidding. Just kidding. [everyone laughs]
",1
925,Sandy,11," That SpongeBob is funnier than ears on an acorn.
",1
926,SpongeBob,11," Oh, this is it. They're all gonna find out I'm a fake. I can't give up. I've got to try. I can do it! I've got Anchor Arms! I'm no wimp, I'm a jerk! [blows his Anchor Arms over the ""JERK"" size. Tries the lift the anchor again but when he tries too hard, some of the air in one arm goes into SpongeBob's nose. Tries to lift again but the air goes into his left eye as the crowd 'ooh's. Tries to lift again the and causes the air to go into his left tooth. Tries to lift again the last time, causing the Anchor Arms to burst around his body then explodes. After the air blows off, the popped Anchor Arms deflates, floating down. SpongeBob then reveals his real arms hidden from inside his body]
",1
927,Crowd Attendee,11," I think he lost. [crowd chants for Sandy] Sandy! Sandy! Sandy! [Sandy walks up to SpongeBob and taps her foot, disappointed. SpongeBob walks away, leaving his destroyed Anchor Arms on the ground and follows Sandy to the Treedome]

Now, he ties his shoes which are on stilts] Long. [pops out of a toaster as some bread] Tan. [licks his two front teeth that are braced up] Handsome. Okay Gary, wait till Pearl gets an eyeful of this! [Gary hides in his shell, the turtle hides in his shell to. Later, SpongeBob's limo drives up to Mr. Krabs house. SpongeBob rings the door bell and Mr. Krabs opens the door]

958,Mr. Krabs,12," Hello? [SpongeBob lowers himself by some sort of crank] What do you think Pearl? Cleans up pretty well, doesn't he?
",1
959,Pearl,12," [wearing a pink dress] Well, at last no one will recognize you. Now listen, SpongeBob, I just want to get through this with my social status intact. [SpongeBob writes down a list of what Pearl wants to do on a notepad] I want to go to the prom, get my picture taken, and I want to dance... [SpongeBob has a big list now] ...I want to drink punch with my friends and don't do that other thing you're always doing...

[Squidward takes his costume off and whistles nonchalantly] Turning the Flying Dutchman name in a laughingstock. But that's not the reason I'm taking your souls. [pointing at SpongeBob, who is hanging upside down] No, this is the straw that broke the camel's back. Out of all the Dutchman costumes I've seen, yours is the most insulting.
",1
1111,SpongeBob,13," Do you mean I'm not scary?
",1
1112,Flying Dutchman,13," You? Scary?! [laughs. Takes SpongeBob off the rope] Let me tell you about scary, kid. There's all kinds of scary things in the world. Spiders are scary, uhh, I'm scary.

1181,SpongeTron,14," Well, why didn't you just ask? The time machine is down the hall, to the left. [Squidward runs to the door, laughs and enters, but the sound of a can-opener being used is heard. Squidward steps out and is torn into pieces, now appearing like a spring-shaped patch of skin] Oops! Oh, yeah, that one's the can opener... But, try the one on the right. [Squidward tries the door on the right and enters a room that has a slot-looking machine that says ""past"" and ""future""]
",1
1182,Squidward,14," Well, I wouldn't've chosen this interior... [notices time-travel handle] Oh, what's this? Well, if SpongeBob exists in the future, I'd better go to the past! [Squidward turns the key and puts the lever on ""past."" Siren goes off as time machine disappears from where it used to be in the Krusty Krab. The door and the wall fly through a hyperspace-like warp, then the time machine appears in a primitive Bikini Bottom.]
",1
1183,Squidward,14," What are you simpletons doing?! You're supposed to catch these things, not torture yourself with them! [Primate Sponge and Prehistoric Starfish are confused] Give me those loincloths! [Primate Sponge and Prehistoric Starfish tear off a piece of their loincloth] I can't believe it. [mumbles to self. Crafts the loincloth jellyfishing nets. Shows them the nets.] This oughta make things go a little smoother! [gives Primate Sponge and Prehistoric Starfish their nets. They put the nets on their lips. Squidward face palms and grabs the nets back] Give me those things! You're supposed to catch them, like this! [Squidward catches the jellyfish in one of the loincloth nets] It's called jellyfishing. [Primate SpongeBob and Prehistoric Starfish grab the nets and chase the jellyfish] Ah, finally. [sits on the ground and plays his clarinet. Primate Sponge and Prehistoric Starfish hear it and go berserk and chase Squidward. Squidward runs into the time machine as Primate Sponge and Prehistoric Starfish try to get in by climbing on top of it] Arrgh! Get me outta here! [moves the lever up and down really fast and breaks it] Uh-oh. [the word FUTURE spins like a slot machine, and stops on 2 lemons and a ""BAR""]
",1
1184,Time Machine,14," Loser! [Primate Sponge & Prehistoric Starfish are banging on the time machine trying to get to Squidward until it disappears into thin-air. The time machine shakes from the inside, with Squidward scared. The camera zooms in, with a ""paint"" effect, then camera is on Squidward's face, and a color change effect goes off. The screen flashes white, and the machine goes through all sorts of dimensions, with one with a computer-like area, then the screen does a color change effect again, with the time machine folding like paper, and it vanishes with a zap sound.]
",1
1185,Squidward,14," He's not here. No more SpongeBob. No more! I may finally have found a place where I can be all... [Squidward becomes tiny] ...alooooooone. [a bunch of ""alone"" sayings appear with a different voice as each comes up]
",1
1186,Voices,14," Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! [Continuous ""Alone"" chanting is heard, as the screen continuously gets smaller and smaller]
",1
1187,Squidward,14," I gotta get outta of here! [Squidward tries to run but he runs off and on the scene. He stops and tries to catch his breath. A strange voice is heard again, he holds his head, sweats a little, and runs again off and on the scene. He stops running after 3 tries to get out, yet another strange voice is heard when he stops] Where's the time machine?! Where's anything? Where, where, where, where?! [jumps up and down angrily and busts a hole through the ground into the time machine. The handle is still broken off. Squidward bangs on the broken controls] I wanna go home! I wanna go home! I wanna go home! I wanna go home! I miss Bikini Bottom! I miss my Easter Island head! I even miss SpongeBob! [right when Squidward says ""SpongeBob,"" the time machine disappears and reappears in present time Bikini Bottom where SpongeBob & Patrick are still waiting for Squidward in front of his house] SpongeBob! Patrick!
",1
1188,SpongeBob & Patrick,14," Hi, Squidward.
",1
1189,Squidward,14," Oh, I'm back! I can't believe this. I-I-I was in space, a-and I went to the future, and-and then I went to the past, and-and then-then I was nowhere, but now I'm back, and-and... you don't know how happy I am to see you guys.
",1
1190,SpongeBob,14," Does this mean you wanna go...
",1
1191,SpongeBob & Patrick,14," Jellyfishing?
",1
1192,Squidward,14," No! D'oh! Who's the barnacle head who invented that game anyway?
",1
1193,SpongeBob & Patrick,14," You are, Squidward! [They laugh as the scene cuts to the little island on the surface]

",1
1206,SpongeBob,15," [walks up to Gary's dream cloud] This must be Gary's dream. I'm gonna get a closer look. [jumps into the dream cloud. He falls down into a library] Whoa! Wow. Look at all these books. I wonder where Gary is. [walks past a pile of books] Gary! Huh? [sees Gary, who is now taller and wearing a cape, reading a book. He walks up to him] Excuse me, sir.

",1
1210,SpongeBob,15," Gary! You can talk!
",1
1211,Gary,15," [sighs] In dreams, one is not tethered by earthly limitations.
",1
1212,SpongeBob,15," What does that mean?
",1
1213,Gary,15," Come. [they walk down an aisle of books] For ages, dreams have been thought of as windows to another realm. [picks up a book and reads from it] ""Let me not mar that perfect dream by an auroral stain, but so adjust my daily night that it may come again."" Emily Dickinson wrote that.
",1
1214,SpongeBob,15," Who?
",1
1215,Gary,15," [flips a few pages] Here's one you might know. [clears throat] There once was a man from Peru who dreamed he was eating his shoe. He woke with a fright in the middle of the night to find that his dream had come true.
",1
1216,SpongeBob,15," [laughs] Gee Gary, you sure are smart.
",1
1217,Gary,15," Did you think my shell was full of hot air?
",1
1218,SpongeBob,15," Well, thanks for the info, Gary. I'm going back to my own dream now. [starts walking away]
",1
1219,Gary,15," Beware of your wandering eye, you little poriferan!
",1
1220,SpongeBob,15," [jumps out of Gary's dream cloud and hops up onto his alarm clock to get into his own; sees Patrick's dream cloud outside the window] I wonder what Patrick's dreaming. [Patrick is stuck to the bottom of his rock, sucking his thumb and snoring. SpongeBob runs over] I can't resist! [laughs and jumps into the dream cloud. Inside, he opens a door to see Patrick rocking back and forth on a 25¢ kiddie ride amidst the blank, white scenery] Hey Patrick!
",1
1221,Patrick,15," Hi SpongeBob.
",1
1222,SpongeBob,15," [walks over] You know Patrick, this is a dream. You can do anything you want.
",1
1223,Patrick,15," Yup.
",1
1224,SpongeBob,15," I mean anything! Watch. I can turn into a skyscraper. [transforms into the shape of a skyscraper] Going up! Eh? [sees that Patrick is unresponsive and frowns, then perks up again] I can make... [changes back to his normal shape and size, this time with a million copies of himself] A million of me! Eh? Eh?
",1
1225,Patrick,15," Yup. [the clones disappear]
",1
1226,SpongeBob,15," Ah, tartar sauce. I'm going to a different dream. [leaves]
",1
1227,Patrick,15," Okay. Bye SpongeBob. [kiddie ride comes to a halt; Patrick reaches into his pocket and pulls out another quarter and goes to put it in the slot, but accidentally drops it and it rolls away] Oh! [the quarter falls into a grate] Shoot, that was my last quarter. [sits on the ride with a dull gaze; meanwhile, SpongeBob hops out of the dream cloud and starts to walk down the block; he stops below Squidward's dream cloud]
",1
1228,SpongeBob,15," Ooh, this is gonna be good! [inflates himself with air and floats up into the cloud; inside, Squidward is playing clarinet in front of an applauding crowd; he has a powdered wig on his head] Psst! Squidward! [waving in the audience; Squidward stops playing] Hey, Squidward!
",1
1229,Squidward,15," SpongeBob!
",1
1230,King,15," Ahem! [sitting in the balcony above the stage] Why do you stop playing, Wolfgang Amadeus Tentacles?
",1
1231,Squidward,15," Yes, Your Highness. [Squidward resumes playing, but SpongeBob tells the king a joke. The king laughs and Squidward stops playing again. He angrily stands up] SpongeBob!
",1
1232,King,15," Hey! I have not instructed you to stop! Now play! [giggles, turns to SpongeBob and nudges him with his elbow] Oh do tell me the one about the man from Peru again.
",1
1233,Squidward,15," [growling, pressing down on his clarinet] Sponge- [accidentally breaks the clarinet. The audience gasps] Bob...
",1
1234,King,15," [angry] I came here here to hear beautiful music! If I don't get my wish, it will be your head!
",1
1235,Squidward,15," [laughs nervously]
",1
1236,SpongeBob,15," [as a clarinet] Squidward! [points to himself and winks] Huh? Huh?
",1
1237,Squidward,15," [throws his broken clarinet pieces off-stage. Speaking with his back turned] No way.
",1
1238,King,15," Ahem! [glares down at Squidward]
",1
1239,Squidward,15," [sighs and picks SpongeBob up] Please SpongeBob, no tricks.
",1
1240,SpongeBob,15," Trust me, Squidward. [Squidward blows into him]
",1
1241,SpongeBob,15," [off-key] La la! La la la la la la la! [The audience gasps again]
",1
1242,Squidward,15," [stops playing] SpongeBob!
",1
1243,King,15," [crying] Wh-wh-why have you stopped playing that wonderful music?
",1
1244,SpongeBob,15," [continues singing off-key]
",1
1245,Fish,15," [crying] His music touches me ever-so. I fear that my tears might stain my petticoat.
",1
1246,Squidward,15," [bowing] Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! [the crowd knocks him aside into a fruit wagon and a fish grabs SpongeBob]
",1
1247,Fish,15," What is this instrument that produces such lovely sound?
",1
1248,SpongeBob,15," [turns back to normal and runs away while audience chases him. Squidward has climbed out of the wagon and is a mess] So long, Squidward! [Squidward starts to growl at him, but the audience members push him back into the fruit wagon and chase after SpongeBob. The King follows too, laughing. SpongeBob runs out the door and flies away.]
",1
1249,Squidward,15," Squidward starts tossing and turning in his bed. Mumbling in angered pain]
",1
1250,SpongeBob,15," [SpongeBob lands on the top of the tree dome] Hey! I'm at Sandy's! [Sandy sleeps in her tree and SpongeBob jumps in her dream cloud and opens a plane door] Aw, this looks neat! I wonder... [falls out of the plane and screams]
",1
1251,Sandy,15," [surfs up on a glide board to SpongeBob] Hey SpongeBob, what brings you here?
",1
1252,SpongeBob,15," Hey Sandy! What's going on?
",1
1253,Sandy,15," [turns upside down] Well, we're free-falling from 114,000 feet, and we're gonna land on that itty-bitty target. [a target is shown on the ground and SpongeBob and Sandy spins around]
",1
1254,SpongeBob,15," This seems kind of dangerous!
",1
1255,Sandy,15," Not as long as you've got a big old parachute!
",1
1256,SpongeBob,15," Okay! [gives her a thumbs-up; both his shoes inflate]
",1
1257,Sandy,15," Not a pair of shoes, SpongeBob! Parachute! [turns upside-down again]
",1
1258,SpongeBob,15," Gotcha! [lifts up a green parakeet perched on his finger]
",1
1259,Sandy,15," Not a Parakeet! Para- [Lands in a truck of clam manure, parachute inflates out of time] medic...
",1
1260,SpongeBob,15," [screams as he crashes through the target, breaking the ground and flips on the real-life ground] Ouch! All right, that's it. No more messing with people's dreams. [sees a dream cloud coming out of Mr. Krabs' house] H-h-hey! Mr. Krabs. [climbs the anchor house and raises his head right under a pink flower in Pearl's dream. Shows a view of various girly decorations,other girly features and boyfriend portraits.] Uhh... Mr. Krabs?
",1
1261,Pearl,15," Hello, SpongeBob! [sits at a table with a green rabbit toy and a brown teddy bear, she pours some tea into the bear's cup]
",1
1262,SpongeBob,15," [waves] Oh, Pearl. This is your dream.
",1
1263,Pearl,15," You're just in time for the tea party!
",1
1264,SpongeBob,15," Actually, I was looking for your dad's dream.
",1
1265,Pearl,15," [Frowns] Oh. He's next door. [Rolls eyes then shakes head in disappointment] Boys don't understand the sophistication of tea parties. Right, Mr. Stuffy?
",1
1266,SpongeBob,15," Bye! [gets out of Pearl's dream and goes over to Mr. Krabs on the right side of the screen] I bet Mr. Krabs' dream will be more robust. [peeks in the cloud and just floats on his backside in the large ocean until he hits Mr. Krabs boat]
",1
1267,Krabs,15," I've got you now, you slippery demon! [inside the boat, he grips into a fishing rod] You're putting up a good fight, yes you are. [SpongeBob hops into the boat]
",1
1268,SpongeBob,15," Whatcha doin Mr. Krabs?
",1
1269,Krabs,15," I'm picking Neptune's pocket!
",1
1270,SpongeBob,15," What are you talking about?
",1
1271,Krabs,15," I'm talking about cold hard flippin' cash. [Moby Dollar appears from the water, caught on the fishing hook] It's the mighty Moby Dollar! [Starts reeling in, making the Moby Dollar come closer and closer.] Did you see her boy? I got her! Here she comes! [Moby Dollar starts spitting out pennies] There she blows!
",1
1272,SpongeBob,15," [laughs] Look, Mr. Krabs. Pennies!
",1
1273,Krabs,15," Never mind the small change, lad. Get the net!
",1
1274,SpongeBob,15," [grabs a small jellyfishing net] This one?
",1
1275,Krabs,15," No, no, no, no! The money net! It's in me back pocket.
",1
1276,SpongeBob,15," [reaches into Mr. Krabs' back pocket and pulls out a huge wallet with Mr. Krabs' license in it] Wow! You look real good with a mustache, Mr. Krabs.
",1
1277,Krabs,15," Never mind that, boy. Ready the net!
",1
1278,SpongeBob,15," [opens up the wallet] Net ready, sir!
",1
1279,Krabs,15," [pulls the dollar out of the water and heaves it into the wallet] I did it! [gets excited] I finally did it!
",1
1280,SpongeBob,15," Congratulations, Mr. Krabs. [puts down the wallet and wants to shake hands with Mr. Krabs but when he tries the wallet bounces toward the back of the boat] [the wallet bounces away]
",1
1281,Krabs,15," No, SpongeBob! Don't let it go!
",1
1282,SpongeBob,15," Huh?
",1
1283,Krabs,15," Get it, SpongeBob! Get it! Get it! Get it! Get it! Get it! [SpongeBob chases after it, but it hops off the back end of the boat]
",1
1284,SpongeBob,15," Hey! Hey! I...!
",1
1285,Krabs,15," No! [dollar hops out of wallet and jumps like a dolphin away in the ocean]
",1
1286,SpongeBob,15," This'll make a great fish story, eh Mr. Krabs?
",1
1287,Krabs,15," [Disappointed] Oh SpongeBob...
",1
1288,SpongeBob,15," Yes, Mr. Krabs?
",1
1289,Krabs,15," [ties SpongeBob up with a rope tied to a plunger sticking out of a gun] You're fired! [Fires the gun, shooting the plunger and tossing SpongeBob with it]
",1
1290,SpongeBob,15," [screams as he gets shot out of the dream cloud and into Plankton's dream on a building. The plunger is stuck onto a building.] Ooh! Hey, Plankton's dreaming about Bikini Bottom.
",1
1291,Plankton,15," Zap! [zaps a building near SpongeBob and fish come running out] I see you. [stomps up to another building, twenty times the size of his normal self] Zap! [shoots a green laser out of his eye]

1292,Fred,15," My leg!
",1
1293,Plankton,15," I see you. Zap!

1294,SpongeBob,15," Plankton! [tries to get himself untied from the rope around his ankle]
",1
1295,Plankton,15," I see you... [SpongeBob gets untied and drops to the ground] Zap! [zaps and disintegrates the building that SpongeBob was on, then walks to the Krusty Krab. People continue to scream in panic] Oh look, it's the Krusty Krab, home of the Krabby Patty. [stomps on it] Crush! [picks up the Krusty Krab sign and starts to lick it as if it were a lollipop and walks off] Lick, lick!
",1
1296,SpongeBob,15," This isn't a dream! This is a nightmare!
",1
1297,Gary,15," Meow! Meow!

1298,SpongeBob,15," [Stops and looks. Appears more and more worried.] Gary! Gary! No!

1302,Plankton,15," Peek-a-boo, here comes my foot! [steps on SpongeBob and Gary] Yeah! Huh? [lifts his foot from pain] Yow!
",1
1303,SpongeBob,15," [looking like a thumbtack] I think he's got the point. [laughs]
",1
1304,Plankton,15," [Starts shrinking.] Waaaaaah! [as he screams his voice gets higher and higher until he goes back to his normal size. Three burnt fish walk up to Plankton looking mad] Well, I guess I've got some explaining to do, huh? [Burned Fred lifts his foot about to stomp on Plankton] No! No! No! Not the face! [gets stepped on. Wakes up screaming and his dream cloud pops, making dream SpongeBob fall]
",1
1305,SpongeBob,15," [comes out and plops on the ground] Ooh! [SpongeBob walks home into his own dream cloud where his real self is still sleeping] Ah, that was fun and all, but it's good to be back in my own dream cloud. [goes to sleep] Ah...

1360,SpongeBob,16," [takes a quarter out of his pocket] Here, why don't you take this quarter and...
",1
1361,Patrick,16," [snatches it from SpongeBob] Oh my gosh, a quarter! I've always wanted a quarter!
",1
1362,SpongeBob,16," It's not the quarter.
",1
1363,Patrick,16," Oh.
",1
1364,SpongeBob,16," Now take that quarter and buy some cotton candy... [Patrick interrupts and SpongeBob's finger deflates]
",1
1365,Patrick,16," Cotton candy! I can't believe it! [Patrick chases the cotton candy seller] Cotton candy!
",1
1366,Cotton Candy Seller,16," Hey, get away! Hey!
",1
1367,Sandy,16," Sandy to SpongeBob. [SpongeBob takes out a walkie-talkie where Sandy's voice is coming from] Sandy to SpongeBob. Come in SpongeBob.
",1
1368,SpongeBob,16," Ten-four Sandy, SpongeBob here. [we see Sandy closing in with the balloon on the carnival]
",1
1369,Sandy,16," [floating toward the carnival in the balloon] I got a visual on the carnival. You want me to bring her in?
",1
1370,SpongeBob,16," Ohh, not yet, Sandy. Patrick's still trying to guess what his Valentine is.
",1
1371,Sandy,16," [chuckles] You are such a kidder, Sandy out. That SpongeBob... [a group of Orange Balloon Destroyer oysters are heading toward the balloon] Scallops...chocolate-eating scallops!
",1
1372,Patrick,16," So if it's not cotton candy then what is it? I can't take it!
",1
1373,SpongeBob,16," You'll have to guess!
",1
1374,Patrick,16," [points at a tent] This tent?
",1
1375,SpongeBob,16," No.
",1
1376,Patrick,16," [holds up a man who is waiting in line for Heart-A-Whirl] This guy?
",1
1377,SpongeBob,16," No. [we see micro-organisms swimming around; it's Patrick's view through a microscope]
",1
1378,Patrick,16," This paramecium?
",1
1379,SpongeBob,16," [laughs] Nope.
",1
1380,Patrick,16," [giggles] Heh, you're a sly one. I can't find here in the carnival...because it's on top of Mount 'Climb Up and Fall Off'. [runs up the mountain and falls off then runs back to SpongeBob] It wasn't there either!
",1
1381,SpongeBob,16," Are you sure? [runs up mountain and falls off again. SpongeBob uses his walkie-talkie to tell Sandy something] SpongeBob to Sandy, you can bring it in now. [Sandy is using a whip to keep scallops away]
",1
1382,Sandy,16," Uhh, SpongeBob, we got ourselves a little problem. I got a pack of chocolate-eating scallops trying to rustle the balloon! Hi-yah! Get away, you sweet-toothed varmints! Hi-yah! I'm going to be a little late!
",1
1383,SpongeBob,16," Late? But what about... [Patrick still jumping on and off mountain] ...Patrick?
",1
1384,Sandy,16," Hing-ya! Take him up to the Ferris wheel and I'll meet you there! Sandy out!
",1
1385,SpongeBob,16," [puts away the walkie-talkie] If Patrick doesn't get his valentine... [screams]
",1
1386,Patrick,16," [suddenly appears from behind, all bruised] I'm pretty sure it's not up there, SpongeBob!
",1
1387,SpongeBob,16," Uhh...Patrick, actually it's on the Ferris...
",1
1388,Patrick,16," Ferris wheel! [he grabs Sponge and runs toward it; cut to them on the Ferris wheel being brought to the top] I'm ready for the greatest Valentine's present in the whole world now, SpongeBob.
",1
1389,SpongeBob,16," Well this is where you're gonna get it...I hope. Just keep looking out there, pal. [SpongeBob talks to Sandy again on the walkie-talkie] SpongeBob to Sandy, SpongeBob to Sandy, come in, Sandy! [Sandy is fighting the chocolate eating scallops]
",1
1390,Sandy,16," Sandy to SpongeBob, I got my ox in a ditch here! I'm way off course! The scallops are eating the balloon! They're everywhere! [One scallop bites the balloon and the air goes out and it floats down] Aw, shoot! We're going down, SpongeBob! Switch to plan B!
",1
1391,SpongeBob,16," No, no, B, Sandy! No, B! [Patrick is smiling big waiting for his surprise] Uh, Patrick, you know how sometimes you plan something special and things don't just work out?
",1
1392,Patrick,16," No...no...eh-gee! Holy mackerel! Is it hot up here or what! [rips off his shirt and moves the ferries wheel seats back and forth and then up and down. Next, the ferries wheel is jumping up and down and then SpongeBob puts out his hand/arm]
",1
1393,SpongeBob,16," Patrick, here it is! [Patrick stares at SpongeBob's hand/arm]
",1
1394,Patrick,16," What's that?
",1
1395,SpongeBob,16," It's a handshake...a friendly handshake.
",1
1396,Patrick,16," A handshake? That's the big gift? You got me a handshake?
",1
1397,SpongeBob,16," A friendly handshake. Happy Valentine's Day! [Patrick shakes his hand and stares it and makes a grumpy looking face. SpongeBob laughs and throughout their playtime in the carnival, Patrick has the same grumpy look on his face]
",1
1398,Patrick,16," I've been thinking. At first a handshake doesn't seem like much, but really it's the thought that counts… [a woman walks up with a box shaped like a heart full of chocolates in her arms]
",1
1399,Fran,16," Hey SpongeBob, I just wanted to thank you for this box of chocolates.
",1
1400,SpongeBob,16," Uh, no problem Fran. [walks off]
",1
1401,Patrick,16," And even though I was expecting more... [a man with roses walks up]
",1
1402,Dave,16," Thanks for the roses, SpongeBob. Happy Valentine's Day.
",1
1403,SpongeBob,16," You too, Dave. [walks off]
",1
1404,Patrick,16," And not that it matters that we've been friends for so long... [some woman walks by with a bike]
",1
1405,Female Fish,16," Hey SpongeBob, thanks for the bike! [talking to Patrick] Can you believe this guy? I just met him this morning! [Patrick begins to fume]
",1
1406,Patrick,16," So as I was saying...
",1
1407,Male Fish,16," Excuse me; do you guys have the time?
",1
1408,Patrick,16," [Patrick gets angry and yells] [House of Horror music composed by W. Merrick Farran, Thomas Chase, and Steve Rucker starts playing] Patrick needs love, too! [Patrick goes psycho freaky. He bangs his stomach like a gorilla. Grunts angrily as he runs closer towards the screen. Angrily approaches the balloon cart, then cuts the balloon strings from a salesman and smashes the balloon cart with his buttocks. Cut to scene where children play with a guy in a heart suit. The children run off as Patrick approaches]
",1
1409,Patrick,16," I defy you, Heartman! [Patrick rips the suit in half and yells again]
",1
1410,P.A. System,16," Attention everyone, there's a chubby pink starfish on the loose! [everyone runs screaming. Patrick sees a twirl-around ride that has hearts on it and goes mad over it]
",1
1411,Patrick,16," Heart on stick must die! [goes to the pole and tries to pick it up. Gives up eventually in tiredness. Patrick sees a little girl eating a heart-shaped lollipop] Heart on stick must die! [grabs it, breaks it, and stuffs it in his mouth. Girl screams as Patrick takes the lollipop.]
",1
1412,SpongeBob,16," [gasps] Patrick!
",1
1413,Patrick,16," [Turns around with an evil look on his face. Angrily grumbles jibberish, making everyone scared and run to a dead-end at the Goo Lagoon dock. Patrick goes freaky on them, there was nothing that everybody couldn't do] Huaaagh!
",1
1414,Patrick,16," Give me SpongeBob! [SpongeBob is thrown in front of the group of citizens]
",1
1415,SpongeBob,16," [laughs embarrassingly]
",1
1416,Patrick,16," You broke my heart! Now I'm gonna break something of yours!
",1
1417,SpongeBob,16," Okay, Patrick, I know I deserve this. [notes the crowd] But, do they?
",1
1418,Patrick,16," They didn't get me anything either! [They throw a pile of gifts at Patrick's feet] Nope, it's too late for that now... for all of you! [walks onto and over the gifts, about to kill everyone, starting with SpongeBob. the citizens take a step back and SpongeBob is scared]
",1
1419,Sandy,16," Yee-haw! Get along little shellfish! Gallop you scallops! [whipping the scallops as she lands in the carnival with the balloon]
",1
1420,SpongeBob,16," Yeah! Sandy's here! Woo-hoo! Look Patrick, it's here! It's here! The best valentine in the whole wide world is right behind you! [jumping up and down pointing behind Patrick]
",1
1421,Patrick,16," Sure it is.
",1
1422,SpongeBob,16," I'm telling you, it's right there, turn around!
",1
1423,Patrick,16," Uh-uh.
",1
1424,SpongeBob,16," Patrick, just turn around! [But he wouldn't listen. everyone is yelling at Patrick to turn around but he doesn't]
",1
1425,Crowd,16," Turn around! You nincompoop! Why you?
",1
1426,Patrick,16," You must think I'm pretty dumb, huh?
",1
1427,Crowd,16," Yes! Turn around!
",1
1428,Patrick,16," No.
",1
1429,Crowd,16," Turn - a-round! Turn - a-round!
",1
1430,Patrick,16," Nuh-uh. I'm gonna say this once and I'm not going to say it again, so pay attention. I am not, I repeat, not going to turn around for any reason...ever!
",1
1431,Sandy,16," Howdy, Patrick!
",1
1432,Patrick,16," [turns around] Hi Sandy! [notices the chocolate balloon then is confused and speaks gibberish]
",1
1433,SpongeBob,16," Happy Valentine's Day, Patrick! [Patrick jumps for joy and jumps on the balloon]
",1
1434,Patrick,16," Yay! My valentine! Hey, is this solid chocolate?
",1
1435,SpongeBob,16," Patrick, no! [Patrick bites the balloon and chocolate spills everywhere. SpongeBob and Patrick are in the mess]

1436,Patrick,16," Aw SpongeBob, you didn't have to get me anything.",1

1443,Mr. Krabs,17," Where could they be? They should've been here hours ago! Arrgh! Not a customer in sight. If I don't make any money today, I surely break out in a rash!
",1
1444,SpongeBob,17," Yippee! I'm rich! Look Patrick, eight gold doubloons!
",1
1445,Mr. Krabs,17," Wait, I saw it first! Hah! [Jumps onto table and sweats] Mine, mine! Huh?!
",1
1446,SpongeBob,17," Boy Mr. Krabs, you sure are sweaty.
",1
1447,Mr. Krabs,17," What's this? Where are the doubloons?
",1
1448,Patrick,17," Based on a real treasure map.
",1
1449,SpongeBob,17," Take a break and play around with us.
",1
1450,Patrick,17," Yeah! C'mon sweaty.
",1
1451,Mr. Krabs,17," Have you finished cleaning the tables?
",1
1452,SpongeBob,17," I cleaned the tables Mr. Krabs!
",1
1453,Mr. Krabs,17," Ay, but did you scrape all the gum off the underside?
",1
1454,SpongeBob,17," [chewing gum] I already took care of it.
",1
1455,Mr. Krabs,17," Ha ha ha. All right, lads. Looks like you've shanghaied me.
",1
1456,Patrick,17," My turn. [rolls dice] Five. [makes raspberry noise while moving piece. Reads card] One of your shipmates has been a bad pirate! Send him to the brig! Hmmm. [SpongeBob turns eyes toward Mr. Krabs] It's off to jail for you, Mr. Krabs.
",1
1457,Mr. Krabs,17," Patrick, you're fired!
",1
1458,Patrick,17," But I don't even work here!

1459,Mr. Krabs,17," Would you like a job, starting now? [puts hat on Patrick's head]

1462,SpongeBob,17," My turn. [rolls dice] One, two, three, four. [picks up card and reads it] Look for the Deacon's Goose thru the fork in the old tree and head that way. [looks through the hole in the tree] Well, I see Mr. Krabs' zipper is undone.
",1
1463,Mr. Krabs,17," [gasps] Shiver me timbers!
",1
1464,SpongeBob,17," [laughs] Just kidding, Mr. Krabs. I'm almost to the treasure. Your turn again Mr. Krabs.
",1
1465,Mr. Krabs,17," [rolls dice] Ooh, fish eyes. One, two.
",1
1466,SpongeBob,17," [picks up card and reads it] You are a real pirate. Go straight to the ""X"" that marks the spot. You get to dig for treasure Mr. Krabs!
",1
1467,Mr. Krabs,17," Treasure. [digs and mini plastic treasure chest appears] There it is! It's the Flying Dutchman's Treasure! Gold, gold, gold. Mine, mine, mine, mine, mine. [starts sweating profusely]

1468,SpongeBob,17," Hey, Mr. Krabs is getting all sweaty again.
",1
1469,Fred,17," [walks into The Krusty Krab] Rev up those fryers, cause I am sure hungry for one-- [Mr. Krabs picks him up, holds him over his head, and heads for the door]  Help! Help! [Mr. Krabs throws him out the door] My leg!
",1
1470,Mr. Krabs,17," Can't you see we're closed?! Ready for another round? This is my kind of game!
",1
1471,SpongeBob and Patrick,17," Hooray!
",1
1472,Mr. Krabs,17," Six! One, two... [scenery changes from day to night. SpongeBob and Patrick are tired; Patrick is even asleep on the table] I win again! Oh, that's seventeen times in a row.
",1
1473,SpongeBob,17," I think we ought to call it a night, Mr. Krabs. I really got to get some sleep.
",1
1474,Mr. Krabs,17," Oh, you can't walk out on me now.
",1
1475,SpongeBob,17," I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. [he yawns, slings Patrick over his shoulder, and carries him out] See you tomorrow. [walks inside house after taking Patrick home. Rattling noises heard] Huh? Who's there? [turns light on]
",1
1476,Mr. Krabs,17," C'mon, SpongeBob. One more game. I can smell the treasure.
",1
1477,SpongeBob,17," [pushes Mr. Krabs outside] Mr. Krabs, it is late. Go to bed! Good night, Mr. Krabs. [closes door but Mr. Krabs is inside the house once again]

1478,Mr. Krabs,17," Wind is perfect, the tide is right. Let's hunt for treasure.
",1
1479,SpongeBob,17," Mr. Krabs, you gotta... [opens door, and Mr. Krabs is now outside]
",1
1480,Mr. Krabs,17," That's awful lad. If the Dutchman hears ya, we'll never get his treasure.
",1
1481,SpongeBob,17," But Mr. Krabs...
",1
1482,Mr. Krabs,17," I'll roll for ya boy.
",1
1483,SpongeBob,17," But, Mr...
",1
1484,Mr. Krabs,17," [rolls dice] Eight paces, now that's a good start lad.
",1
1485,SpongeBob,17," But, Mr...
",1
1486,Mr. Krabs,17," One, two, three...
",1
1487,SpongeBob,17," [yelling] Mr. Krabs! I wanna go to bed! Mr. Krabs, I'm sorry, but it's just a game, ya know?
",1
1488,Mr. Krabs,17," A game. That's... right. Of course it is, my mistake. I guess I got a little carried away, eh? On this treasure we're dealing here. Sorry, for disturbing ya, lad. [morning arrives] Avas! Pineapple, ho. Heave two, and prepare to be boarded.
",1
1489,SpongeBob,17," Aw, go home already. I'm done playing that game, Mr. Krabs.
",1
1490,Mr. Krabs,17," It's Captain Krabs to you, and this is no game. We're gonna be pirates.
",1
1491,SpongeBob,17," Pirates?
",1
1492,Mr. Krabs,17," Ay! How'd you like to go on a real treasure hunt, with a real treasure map?
",1
1493,SpongeBob and Patrick,17," [Patrick appears from the side of SpongeBob's house] Treasure? [dancing around] We're gonna be pirates, we're gonna be pirates!
",1
1494,Mr. Krabs,17," Ay, ay, ay. Relay that skipping. Pirates don't skip. [throws them a bag of pirate stuff] Put on this pirate garb, so I won't be embarrassed to be seen with ya. Arrgh.
",1
1495,SpongeBob,17," Oh, Patrick. Look! Peg legs and eye patches.
",1
1496,Mr. Krabs,17," Now, don't you feel more like pirates?
",1
1497,SpongeBob,17," [Walks towards the plank using two peg legs] Look, I'm Peggy the Pirate! [falls on plank]
",1
1498,Patrick,17," [Walks towards the plank with two separate eyepatches covering his eyes] I'm Blind Beard the Pirate. [falls on SpongeBob]
",1
1499,SpongeBob,17," Ow.
",1
1500,Mr. Krabs,17," Arrgh! [sailing underwater] Keep a sharp lookout. According to the map, we're close to the first landmark.
",1
1501,SpongeBob,17," Really? Can we see the map?
",1
1502,Mr. Krabs,17," Uh... no! Only the captain can lay eyes on the map.
",1
1503,SpongeBob,17," Okie dokie, then.
",1
1504,Mr. Krabs,17," Arrgh, a pirate doesn't say, ""okie dokie, then."" A pirate says, ""arrgh!""
",1
1505,SpongeBob,17," Okie... oops. [laughs while a jellyfish swims by him] I mean... [standing up] arrgh! Captain Krabs. [eyes widen] Captain, we're about to hit... uhh... I mean... arrgh, Capt., arrgh, we're, arrgh, about, arrgh, to hit, arrgh...
",1
1506,Mr. Krabs,17," Out with it man, arrgh!
",1
1507,Patrick,17," I, arrgh, think, arrgh, he's trying, arrgh, to say...! [crash] land...
",1
1508,Mr. Krabs,17," ARRGH! From now on, only the captain says, arrgh! Status report, Mr. SquarePants?
",1
1509,SpongeBob,17," The whole ship is underwater captain.
",1
1510,Mr. Krabs,17," Arrgh, we're marooned then. Our treasure hunt will have to continue on foot. This is it boys, from the seaweed with two leaves on it. 10,000 paces east.
",1
1511,SpongeBob,17," But Mr. Krabs, that seaweed has... [Mr. Krabs pulls a leaf off] Which way captain?
",1
1512,Mr. Krabs,17," Answer Patrick. Which was is east?
",1
1513,Patrick,17," Uhh... let's see, uhh... [points] that way captain!
",1
1514,Mr. Krabs,17," 9,997... 9,998... 9,999... 10,000! Where's the ""X""? Supposed to be right here! 10,000 paces east.
",1
1515,Patrick,17," Ooh! East? I thought you said ""weast""!
",1
1516,Mr. Krabs,17," Weast? What kind of compass you reading lad?
",1
1517,Patrick,17," This one, sir.
",1
1518,Mr. Krabs,17," That's west, Patrick. You're fired again. 9,551... 9,552...
",1
1519,SpongeBob,17," Mr. Krabs, we're tired.
",1
1520,Patrick,17," And hungry.
",1
1521,Mr. Krabs,17," Ooh. So this is my crew. You get a little tired, and a wee-bit hungry, and you want to shove off for home. Arrgh! That sickens me. A pirate is not judged by the notches in his compass, but by the sides of his booty. A pirate is judged by the loyalty and his crew. And without a loyal crew,[one of SpongeBob's eyes fill up with tears, as he was getting ready to cry] what am I captain of? Just a bunch of sand! [cries]
",1
1522,Patrick,17," Don't cry, Captain Krabs.
",1
1523,SpongeBob,17," [sniffles and crying] Yeah, we'll be your loyal crew. [both cry]
",1
1524,Mr. Krabs,17," You'll stay with me then?
",1
1525,SpongeBob and Patrick,17," We'll be the most loyal pirate crew ever!
",1
1526,Mr. Krabs,17," I knew I could count on you boys. One for all!
",1
1527,SpongeBob and Patrick,17," And all for one! [laying on ground at night outside tent]
",1
1528,SpongeBob,17," I'm so loyal, I don't even mind sleeping on the cold, hard ground while Captain Krabs sleeps in his warm, dry tent.
",1
1529,Patrick,17," I'm so loyal, I haven't bathed in weeks.
",1
1530,SpongeBob,17," But we've only been gone a few hours.
",1
1531,Patrick,17," I know. [laughs. SpongeBob moves away]
",1
1532,SpongeBob,17," I'm so loyal, I don't wanna sleep till we find the treasure. Let's go see if the captain will go now!
",1
1533,SpongeBob and Patrick,17," Captain Krabs?
",1
1534,SpongeBob,17," He's not here.
",1
1535,Patrick,17," Look! The treasure map.
",1
1536,SpongeBob,17," Only the captain can look at the map, Patrick.
",1
1537,Patrick,17," Yeah...
",1
1538,SpongeBob,17," Patrick, what are you doing?
",1
1539,Patrick,17," Nothing.
",1
1540,SpongeBob,17," Patrick, you're not suppose to look at the map. [Patrick touches the map]
",1
1541,Patrick,17," I'm not looking, I'm touching. There's no rule against that is there?
",1
1542,SpongeBob,17," No, guess there isn't. [Both poking map. Map opens] Oops! Patrick, it opened by itself. [Both laugh. Eyes enlarge and search the map]
",1
1543,SpongeBob and Patrick,17," The map, the map, gotta see it, gotta look at it. [Eyes freeze for a second and then pop back in their heads.]
",1
1544,Patrick,17," SpongeBob?
",1
1545,SpongeBob,17," Yeah?
",1
1546,Patrick,17," Did you notice something familiar about this map?
",1
1547,SpongeBob,17," You mean, like that it's our game board taped to a piece of paper?
",1
1548,Mr. Krabs,17," [appearing right behind them] Do you think this is a problem?
",1
1549,SpongeBob and Patrick,17," [scream] Mr. Krabs!
",1
1550,Mr. Krabs,17," Sneaking peeks at me treasure?
",1
1551,Patrick,17," We're sorry.
",1
1552,Mr. Krabs,17," That's mutiny on my ship. So you think ol' Captain Krabs has gone crazy, do ye?
",1
1553,SpongeBob,17," Not at all, Captain Krabs. We don't think that at all!
",1
1554,Patrick,17," I think that.
",1
1555,Mr. Krabs,17," I'm gonna throw you overboard for saying that!
",1
1556,SpongeBob,17," [gasps] Look! It's the ""X"".
",1
1557,Mr. Krabs,17," [eyes go into ""X"" like symbol] ""X"" marks the spot!
",1
1558,SpongeBob,17," Wow! That game really is based on a real treasure map.
",1
1559,Mr. Krabs,17," Well, what are you waiting for lads? Dig! Dig! Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig.
",1
1560,SpongeBob,17," We got it Captain Krabs.
",1
1561,Mr. Krabs,17," Ha, ha. Hand it up to me lads. Heave! [Brings treasure up]
",1
1562,Mr. Krabs,17," We finally found it. [opens up the treasure chest]
",1
1563,Female Singers,17," The Dutchman's Treasure.
",1
1564,All,17," Wow!
",1
1565,SpongeBob,17," What are you going to do with your share, Patrick?
",1
1566,Patrick,17," I don't know. How are you going to spend your share, SpongeBob?
",1
1567,Mr. Krabs,17," What shares? You're not getting any of my treasure!
",1

1682,SpongeBob,18," Okay, Patrick, that's enough.

1683,Patrick,18," Why? You think that old slowpoke Texas is gonna... [... catch up, which she is. And fast. Patrick's eyes bug out and he screams]

1684,SpongeBob,18," Run faster, Patrick! [both of them scream; they go around each side of a huge rock. Sandy crashes right through the rock, obliterating it, and walks with a twirling rope. Her shoe engulfs the screen, Sandy ropes Patrick and brings him into the background]

1685,Patrick,18," [screams] SpongeBob! [Nuclear explosion is heard and a mushroom cloud appears. SpongeBob screams. SpongeBob stops in front of a leaf and shakes as Sandy karate chops the leaf and SpongeBob in half]

1698,SpongeBob,18," Don't cry anymore, Sandy, I'll go get your bags.

1775,Squidward,19," [growls] Where's SpongeBob?
",1
1776,Patrick,19," He's in the house. He's impressed.
",1
1777,Squidward,19," With what?
",1
1778,Patrick,19," I don't know, but it must have been pretty good to make him cry like that.
",1
1779,Squidward,19," [shivers then goes back to SpongeBob's house] SpongeBob, SpongeBob, let me in there! [tries to turn the handle but SpongeBob's arm comes from under the door and pulls it inside. Squidward grabs his clarinet] SpongeBob, you'd better let me in there! I don't want to have to use this! [plays clarinet horribly. SpongeBob opens the door]
",1
1780,SpongeBob,19," What do you want?
",1
1781,Squidward,19," SpongeBob, I just wanted to say that I'm sorr-yyyy. [sticks out tongue while talking]
",1
1782,SpongeBob,19," What?
",1
1783,Squidward,19," I'm trying to say I'm [turns into a donkey and starts braying] hee-haw-hee-haw!
",1
1784,SpongeBob,19," What?
",1
1785,Squidward,19," I'm just trying to say that I'm... [head explodes] There's gotta be an easier way to do this. [bubble transition to Squidward writing a note. He puts it in a bottle and rolls it to SpongeBob where he picks it up] Well, aren't you going to open it?
",1
1786,SpongeBob,19," I can't, I don't have a bottle opener. [Squidward hands SpongeBob a can and Squidward drives to the other side of the road]
",1
1787,Squidward,19," SpongeBob, I'm... [whispers into the can. Puts the can up to his ear but hears some sort of noise. Patrick is flossing his teeth with the cord. Squidward throws the binoculars down on the ground] SpongeBob, all I am trying to say is that I am... [waves tentacles in the air and bubbles form. Puts a big bubble on his head and then talks] ...sorry. [pops the bubble] There you go.
",1
1788,SpongeBob,19," But I couldn't... [Squidward slams the door in his face]
",1
1789,Squidward,19," I don't care! I said it! My conscience is clear! [Starts to walk away, when an image of Patrick appears in the air]
",1
1790,Patrick,19," It must have been pretty good to make him cry like that. [Squidward nervously continues walking and runs into a ghost image of a guy at the Krusty Krab]
",1
1791,Tom,19," April Fools...jerk. [Squidward frantically starts running again, but this time his mother appears]
",1
1792,Mama Tentacles,19," [man voice] You stink!
",1
1793,Squidward,19," Mother? [runs back to SpongeBob's house to apologize] All right, all right! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I admit it, I'm sorry! I didn't mean to hurt you, in fact SpongeBob, I like you! I like living next door, I like hearing your foghorn alarm in the morning and your high-pitched giggling at night! I also like Gary, Patrick, Sandy, Mr. Krabs, and all the other people I'm forced to be in contact with! And, and, and... [SpongeBob opens the door slightly]
",1
1794,SpongeBob,19," Squidward! Is all that true?
",1
1795,Squidward,19," Yes, SpongeBob. Yes, it's all true.
",1
1796,SpongeBob,19," Even the part about the lima beans and the car chase?
",1
1797,Squidward,19," What the...? Yes, whatever! But you have to promise not to tell anybody.
",1
1798,SpongeBob,19," I promise.
",1
1799,Squidward,19," Really? [SpongeBob opens the door all the way, revealing the citizens of Bikini Bottom inside]
",1
1800,All,19," April Fools!
",1
1801,Squidward,19," [twitches eye] April Fools! You're right, April Fools! I just fooled you all! [laughs hysterically while going back into his house]

",1
1823,Mr. Krabs,20," Aye. [shapes his arm like a hook] The hooks. They dangle down and draw you close with their pleasing shapes and their beguiling colors. And just when you think you found the land of milk and honey they grab you by the britches... [grabs Scooter's pants and lifts high like he is giving him a wedgie] ...and haul you way up high. Then higher, and higher, and higher  [he opens a hatch on the roof and points at the surface] until you're hauled up to the surface flopping and gasping for breath.

[trips and falls on face] We're going to the carnival. We're going to the carnival. There it is, SpongeBob. The carnival is back in town. [many hooks are dangling] I'm gonna be first in line for everything!
",1
1834,SpongeBob,20," Where is everybody?
",1
1835,Patrick,20," I don't know. There was one kid here, earlier.
",1
1836,SpongeBob,20," Doesn't look like any carnival I ever... [bumps into a hook] Excuse me. [gasps as he sees the hook] Stop, Patrick! Don't touch it! This isn't the carnival, Patrick. Those are hooks. Mr. Krabs said they were really dangerous.
",1
1837,Patrick,20," [sits on a hook] Hmmm. I sense no danger here. How can they be dangerous? They're covered with free cheese!
",1
1838,SpongeBob,20," All I know is that Mr. Krabs said...Patrick, don't do that!

",1
1845,Patrick,20," Am I ever. You should try it.
",1
1846,SpongeBob,20," But...what about the surface, and your britches, and the gift shops.
",1
1847,Patrick,20," You just jump off before you get too high.
",1
1848,SpongeBob,20," Mr. Krabs said I shouldn't get near those things.
",1
1849,Patrick,20," Did he say you shouldn't climb on top of them and ride them like a horsey? [he jumps on a fish-like attachment on the hook]
",1
1850,SpongeBob,20," Well, no.
",1
1851,Patrick,20," Wheeee.
",1
1852,SpongeBob,20," I guess he didn't. [he jumps on the attachment with Patrick]
",1
1853,Patrick,20," Hi Ho, Silverfish. Away! [The hook pulls them up. We see a fisherman reeling in his fishing rod. We see SpongeBob and Patrick laughing out of enjoyment. Camera alternates between the fisherman to SpongeBob and Patrick. After a few cuts, SpongeBob and Patrick are about to jump off]
",1
1854,SpongeBob,20," Ready?

1855,Patrick,20," Ready.

1856,SpongeBob & Patrick,20," Geronimo! [jump off]

1857,SpongeBob,20," This is more fun than double overtime at the Krusty Krab. [We cut to the exterior at the Krusty Krab when customers are muttering angrily. We cut to see Ivy mad with Harold]

",1
1862,Squidward,20," Why do you wanna eat this stuff anyway?!
",1
1863,Mr. Krabs,20," Mr. Squidward, what the halibut is going on in here?
",1
1864,Squidward,20," It's a feeding frenzy, sir. And SpongeBob's not back from his break. [Mr. Krabs laughs] What?
",1
1865,Mr. Krabs,20," I thought you said SpongeBob was taking a break. No one's taking a break at the Krusty Krab since the Chum Famine of '59. [laughs] Now, what were you saying?
",1
1866,Squidward,20," He took a break.
",1
1867,Mr. Krabs,20," [Mr. Krabs is shocked, as his arms and nose fall off.] Alright, SpongeBob LazyPants, I'll find ya. This nose can smell laziness up to 10,000 leagues. [uses his nose to smell] Aha! I'll give you a break you'll not soon forget.
",1
1868,Squidward,20," But Mr. Krabs, I still need help! [all the customers pick up Squidward like they are a mob]
",1
1869,Mr. Krabs,20," [uses his nose to smell again] They should be right here. [SpongeBob & Patrick float down as they are laughing]
",1
1870,Patrick,20," Again?
",1
1871,SpongeBob,20," Again!
",1
1872,Mr. Krabs,20," The hooks! No! No! No!
",1
1873,SpongeBob and Patrick,20," [pulling on hook] 1, 2, 3...
",1
1874,Mr. Krabs ,20," Wait! Wait!
",1
1875,SpongeBob and Patrick,20," ...blastoff. [hook pulls them up as Mr. Krabs slams into a rock]
",1
1876,Mr. Krabs,20," Boys. I wasn't quick enough. They're gone! [sobs] If I can only hold them in me arms again, I'd...I'd... [SpongeBob and Patrick float back down while laughing] ...I'd throttle 'em! What did I tell you about those hooks, boy?!
",1
1877,SpongeBob,20," I...I...I...
",1
1878,Patrick,20," I'll tell you about the hooks. You ride em up, and up, and up, then you gently flow down.
",1
1879,Mr. Krabs,20," And do you know what happens when you don't float back down?
",1
1880,SpongeBob,20," Gift shop?
",1
1881,Mr. Krabs,20," Worse! You end up vacuum-packed in a can of tuna. [shows a can of tuna] With nothing to look forward to but the smell of mayonnaise. [shows a jar of mayo with a screaming female]
",1
1882,SpongeBob and Patrick,20," We're sorry, Mr. Krabs.
",1
1883,Mr. Krabs,20," I want you boys to promise me you'll never go on those hooks again.
",1
1884,SpongeBob & Patrick,20," [raises hands] We promise Mr. Krabs.
",1
1885,SpongeBob and Patrick,20," Yo-ho, yo-ho, near the hooks we'll never go.
",1
1886,Mr. Krabs,20," Yow! Mother of pearl! Fire on the poop deck!
",1
1887,SpongeBob and Patrick,20," Ahh! Mother of pearl. Fire on the poop deck.
",1
1888,Mr. Krabs,20," Whoa. Whew. Alright then. Let's get out of this death trap. [Cuts to the exterior of SpongeBob's house]
",1
1889,SpongeBob,20," Ok, Gary. Today is a new day. I'm ready to prove myself loyal to Mr. Krabs.
",1
1890,Gary,20," Meow.
",1
1891,SpongeBob,20," I'm ready! [comes running out of the house] I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready, ready, ready. I'm ready. [Patrick comes out from his rock]
",1
1892,Patrick,20," Hey, SpongeBob, you're going the wrong way. [crashes into his furniture]
",1
1893,SpongeBob,20," I always go to work this way.
",1
1894,Patrick,20," You're not going to work today. We're going to go play hooky!
",1
1895,SpongeBob,20," But, Patrick, we promised.
",1
1896,Patrick,20," Well, I had my fingers crossed.
",1
1897,SpongeBob,20," You don't have any fingers, Patrick.
",1
1898,Patrick,20," Well, that Mr. Krabs is just a big dummy. We played on those hooks all day long and nothing happened to us.
",1
1899,SpongeBob,20," But Mr. Krabs said...
",1
1900,Patrick,20," Look, SpongeBob, are you gonna listen to a big dummy, or are you gonna listen to me?
",1
1901,SpongeBob,20," Umm...
",1
1902,Patrick,20," See ya later, SpongeBob. I'm going to go have some fun. [Patrick goes up and down the hooks] Come on SpongeBob. You know you want to.
",1
1903,SpongeBob,20," Ooh, I know I want to, but I promised Mr. Krabs that I wouldn't go near another... [almost runs into a hook. Gasps] ...hook! [almost touches the hook but takes it back] Oh no! Mr. Krabs told me all about you. You are a liar. A deceiver. I'll never fall for your tricks again. Never! [goes back to hook] Is this seat taken? [hook takes him up but when he comes down and turns around, we are shown he is hooked at the pants] Whew. Glad I got that out of my system. [gasps] I'm...hooked! And that means... [shows the tuna can with SpongeBob crammed inside] Help! I'm hooked! Help! Mr. Krabs! Help! It happened! I'm hooked! Oh, no! The hook! The hook! Gift shop, tuna can, mayonnaise!
",1
1904,Mr. Krabs,20," Here you go, Pearl. Free water for all your little friends.
",1
1905,Pearl,20," Thanks, dad.
",1
1906,Mr. Krabs,20," Just don't forget to leave a tip for ol Mr. Krabs.
",1
1907,SpongeBob,20," Psst, Mr. Krabs.
",1
1908,Mr. Krabs,20," SpongeBob! You're two minutes late. What kept you, laddie?
",1
1909,SpongeBob,20," Um, you know those hooks we were talking about yesterday?
",1
1910,Mr. Krabs,20," Didn't I tell you not to go near those hooks?
",1
1911,SpongeBob,20," Umm...no. [hook pulls him a little closer] I mean yes, yes, you told me not to go near them.
",1
1912,Mr. Krabs,20," Well, you weren't playing on those hooks, were you lade?
",1
1913,SpongeBob,20," Of course not. [hook pulls him a little closer] I mean, not exactly. [hook pulls him a little closer] I mean yes! Yes I did it! I admit it! [cries] Oh, Mr. Krabs! I'm so ashamed! I mean, look at me! I'm hooked! [shows the hook to Mr. Krabs]
",1
1914,Mr. Krabs,20," Hmmm, it's in there pretty deep.
",1
1915,SpongeBob,20," What am I going to do?
",1
1916,Mr. Krabs,20," There's only one thing to do, boy. [group of girls laugh. SpongeBob looks at his pants]
",1
1917,SpongeBob,20," Oh no, Mr. Krabs. I can't take off my pants. Not in front of all these girls. [hook pulls him closer] Doh, ok. I'm taking em off. I'm taking 'em off. [takes pants off] There.
",1
1918,Mr. Krabs,20," Uhh...lad?
",1
1919,SpongeBob,20," [screams] Oh no. Oh no, no, no, Mr. Krabs. I can't do it! Anything but that!
",1
1920,Mr. Krabs,20," I understand. You were a good little fry cook, SpongeBob. [he places a ""Help Wanted"" sign on the door] But, we'll find another. Hopefully one that will listen to ol Mr. Krabs.
",1
1921,SpongeBob,20," [hook pulls him a little closer] Oh, Mr. Krabs! I'll listen! I promise. [He holds on to a flower but the hook pulls him away. He holds on to the Krusty Krab signpost] Please save me, Mr. Krabs! [cries] I promise I'll be good! [underwear tears] Whew. [the signpost flings him into the door naked, which makes the girls laugh]

1922,Pearl,20," Ooh, look! [laughs] It's SpongeBob NudeyPants. [SpongeBob screams and runs]

1923,Squidward,20," [holding a fishing hook with SpongeBob's underwear on the hook] Well, that was more of SpongeBob than I needed to see.
",1
1924,Mr. Krabs,20," Mr. Squidward, that was some fine angling. Do you think the lad has learned his lesson?
",1
1925,Squidward,20," Oh, I think he'll remember this for a long time. I know I will. [both laugh. Shows SpongeBob running back to his house]

",2
1943,Patrick,21," Gosh... Probably not.
",2
1944,SpongeBob,21," I learned when I was just a boy, Patrick and I'm willing to pass on what I know. Go sit over there [Points off-screen behind himself] and let an old pro show you how to do it. [Patrick sits down in the chair and SpongeBob sets his foot on the chair's arm] Pay close attention, Patrick. Well, you start [unties his laces] by taking one lace per hand... [pulls a little on both laces] And then you... Uh, you gotta... Loop the, the...
",2
1945,Patrick,21," Are you sure you know how to do it?
",2
1946,SpongeBob,21," Patrick, please, shoe-tying requires peace and quiet. Okay, where was I?
",2
1947,Patrick,21," [SpongeBob gives him a dirty look] Your shoes are still untied. [SpongeBob takes his shoe off the chair]
",2
1948,SpongeBob,21," [looks away] Well, [Patrick looks shocked] I guess you don't want me to show you how to do it.
",2
1949,Patrick,21," I'm sorry! [covers his mouth with his shoes] I won't interrupt anymore!
",2
1950,SpongeBob,21," I've got it! The first rule of shoe-tying is always start with your right foot. Now the lesson will officially begin. [sets his right foot on the chair arm and unties his laces. Ties his laces but they come undone. SpongeBob laughs nervously and tries again but the laces untie themselves once more. Patrick looks angry at him] That's... ""knot"" right. [laughs nervously] Get it? Knot... right... hmm...
",2
1951,Patrick,21," No.
",2

",2
1959,SpongeBob,21," Well, a sponge has to look his spongiest. [walks to the kitchen putting a line of holes in the floor with his feet] Well, I've gotta get to work.

He talks muffled by the fact that he hasn't stood up yet and is talking straight into the floor.] Oh, barnacles! maybe I should just lay here.

1961,SpongeBob,21," He's right! Got to make... Krabby Patties! [he holds out a spatula and gets up] Laces or no laces! [crawls over to the grill while grunting] Ah... I just have to stand in this one spot. [makes a krabby patty] Ta-da! A perfect patty.

2116,SpongeBob,22," Patrick!  You're not ugly. Your breath stinks. Really bad. [Patrick sighs with relief, his stench in the shape of a skull and crossbones]
",2
2117,Patrick,22," Ahhhhhhhh, what a relief...
",2
2118,SpongeBob,22," [his eyes water from the foul smell] Arrgh, barnacles, Patrick! What did you eat?!
",2
2119,Patrick,22," Oh, some roast beef, some chicken, a pizza...
",2
2120,SpongeBob,22," No, I mean just this morning.
",2
2121,Patrick,22," Some roast beef, some chicken, a pizza...
",2
2122,SpongeBob,22," What else?
",2
2123,Patrick,22," Well, I had some of your sundae.
",2
2124,SpongeBob,22," Sundae... [he whips what's remaining of it out] Patrick! My sundae gave us rancid breath!
",2
2125,Patrick,22," Whatcha mean? [SpongeBob coughs as Patrick's breath flies by him]
",2
2126,SpongeBob,22," I mean, we're not ugly, we just stink!
",2
2127,Patrick,22," Stink? [the two cheer and run around in circles chanting]
",2
2128,Both,22," We stink! We stink! We stink! We stink! We stink! We stink!
",2
2129,SpongeBob,22," Oh, guess what, Squidward?
",2
2130,Both,22," We stink! [the two hug Squidward, and then run off, still cheering] We're smelly! I reek! Smell me! [the two run off until they're out of sight]",2

[Patrick is sleeping and the mailfish walks by and puts a box in his open mouth as he is yawning and waking up, he grabs it and quickly opens it, and it turns out to be a shiny, gold trophy]
",2
2138,Patrick,23," An award? I never got an award before! Eeeee! Look rock, I got an award. [arrow on top of rock breaks] Jellyfish, I got an award. [jellyfish zap him and he jumps up above the surface] Island, I got an awar... [chokes for air and floats back down] I gotta show SpongeBob.
",2
2139,SpongeBob,23," [building a house of cards looking like Gary] Hold still, Gary.
",2
2140,Gary,23," Meow.
",2
2141,SpongeBob,23," Almost done. [Patrick smashes through the wall and cards fall on the floor. Gary flies away]
",2
2142,Patrick,23," Hey, SpongeBob, guess what? I got an award.[SpongeBob falls down to the floor]
",2
2143,SpongeBob,23," That's great, Patrick. What's it for?
",2
2144,Patrick,23," See for yourself.
",2
2145,Patrick,23," SpongeBob SquarePants? That's a funny way to spell my name.
",2
2146,SpongeBob,23," Patrick, I think the award is for me. You must've got it by mistake.
",2
2147,Patrick,23," But, it's shiny. [SpongeBob takes the trophy]
",2
2148,SpongeBob,23," Yeah, but you know what else is shiny?
",2
2149,Patrick,23," Ice cream!
",2
2150,SpongeBob,23," Exactly!
",2
2151,Patrick,23," I can find it. Is it in here?
",2
2152,SpongeBob,23," No, don't! That's my... [Patrick opens the door and a bunch of awards pile out of SpongeBob's closet] ...award closet.
",2
2153,Patrick,23," I want an award. [starts to cry]
",2
2154,SpongeBob,23," [SpongeBob with two 1st place ribbons in his eyes] Aww, Patrick, don't cry.[Patrick starts sobbing loudly going away from the awards] 
",2
2155,SpongeBob,23," You'll get an award one day.
",2
2156,Patrick,23," I'm never gonna get an award because I haven't done anything.
",2
2157,SpongeBob,23," But you're Patrick... [jumps on Patrick and his eyes turn into stars] Star. You can do anything you want.
",2
2158,Patrick,23," That's easy for you to say. You're SpongeBob.
",2
2159,SpongeBob,23," Patrick, if you wanna win an award, you have to do something.
",2
2160,Patrick,23," Hmmm...I wanna defeat the giant monkeyman and save the 9th dimension!
",2
2161,SpongeBob,23," Me too! But that sounds a little hard. Why don't we start smaller?
",2
2162,Patrick,23," I wanna defeat the little monkeyman and save the 8th dimension!
",2
2163,SpongeBob,23," Smaller. [shrinks]
",2
2164,Patrick,23," Doctor?
",2
2165,SpongeBob,23," Smaller. [shrinks more]
",2
2166,Patrick,23," Fireman?
",2
2167,SpongeBob,23," [said in the tiny voice] The smallest you can think of. [shrinks even more]
",2
2168,Patrick,23," A job at the Krusty Krab?
",2
2169,SpongeBob,23," [normal voice] Yeah! [grows to normal size] I do things at work all the time.
",2
2170,Patrick,23," Then let's go. [Patrick runs off, pulling off SpongeBob's arm]
",2
2171,Patrick,23," Boy, it sure was nice of Mr. Krabs to give me a job.
",2
2172,SpongeBob,23," And at 50 dollars an hour, too. When I started working here, I had to pay Mr. Krabs 100 dollars an hour. Hey, Squidward, guess who just got a job?
",2
2173,Squidward,23," Guess who just quit? [puts his hat on Patrick's head and then leaves]
",2
2174,Patrick,23," Do I get my award yet?
",2
2175,SpongeBob,23," You have to work for it, remember?
",2
2176,Patrick,23," Tartar sauce. [SpongeBob flipping patties]
",2
2177,SpongeBob,23," [SpongeBob places the order in the window] Pick up order! [Patrick comes and eats the order]
",2
2178,Patrick,23," Do I get my award, now?
",2
2179,SpongeBob,23," No, you have to take the tray to the customer.
",2
2180,Patrick,23," Ok. [tray gets to table but with no food. Patrick burps]
",2
2181,SpongeBob,23," Almost. Try again and this time make sure the food gets to the table. [Patrick arrives with food on tray but then eats it as he sits down]
",2
2182,Patrick,23," Like that?
",2
2183,SpongeBob,23," Nope.
",2
2184,Patrick,23," [spits out food at the customer as he talks] Barnacles!
",2
2185,SpongeBob,23," Let's try something different.
",2
2186,SpongeBob,23," All you have to do is answer the phone.
",2
2187,Patrick,23," Ai Yai, Captain [phone rings]
",2
2188,Guy On Phone,23," Is this the Krusty Krab?
",2
2189,Patrick,23," No, this is Patrick. [hangs up and starts whistling. phone rings again]
",2
2190,Girl On Phone,23," Is this the Krusty Krab?
",2
2191,Patrick,23," [annoyed] No! this is Patrick! [hangs up and continues to whistle. phone rings, yet again]
",2
2192,Another Guy On Phone,23," Is this the Krusty Krab?
",2
2193,Patrick,23," [infuriated] No! This is Patrick! [puts phone down] I'm not a Krusty Krab.
",2
2194,SpongeBob,23," Uhh, Patrick, that's the name of the restaurant.
",2
2195,Patrick,23," Huh? Oh, Fishpaste!
",2
2196,SpongeBob,23," It looks a little dusty around Table 3. How about you sweep it out? [hands Patrick a broom]
",2
2197,Patrick,23," What's the point? I can't do anything right.
",2
2198,SpongeBob,23," You'll do fine. [Patrick sweeps with the top side of the broom instead of the bottom]
",2
2199,Nat,23," [approaches Patrick] Hey pal. You just blow in from Stupidtown? [continues drinking]
",2
2200,SpongeBob,23," Keep trying, Patrick.
",2
2201,Delivery Guy,23," I've got a load of awards for SpongeBob SquarePants. [Patrick becomes furious and sweeps harder]
",2
2202,Patrick,23," Why can't I do anything right?! [bangs the bottom of the broom on the floor making dust rise all over the Krusty Krab's dining area, which makes the nearby customers start coughing]
",2
2203,SpongeBob,23," [pushing Patrick] Kitchen!
",2
2204,Patrick,23," [throws the broom to the floor] I'm never going to get an award, now.
",2
2205,SpongeBob,23," Don't give up, Patrick. This time I've got something I know you can do. We're gonna open a jar. [gets a jar and opens the lid] Easy. Now you try. First get a jar. [Patrick gets out a pickle] Patrick, that's a pickle.
",2
2206,Patrick,23," Yes.
",2
2207,SpongeBob,23," You need a jar. [picks up a spatula] No. [picks up his pants] No. [picks up SpongeBob] No. Try...this! [gives Patrick a jar] Now take the lid off the jar. [puts the lid in his mouth] Just relax. Lift your hand. [Patrick lifts his hand] Great! We're almost there. Now put it on the lid. [puts his hand on counter] No, the lid. [slides his hand to the corner of the counter] [Patrick tries for the lid over and over as SpongeBob keeps telling him ""the lid"", Patrick pants due to exhaustion. Few seconds later, Patrick is almost there] Freeze!! [hand is on the side of the jar] Almost there. Now head for the lid. [hand goes lower] Cold. [hand goes higher] Warmer. [hand goes higher] Warmer. [hand goes higher] Warmer. You're hot. You're on fire!
",2
2208,Patrick,23," Ow, it burns!
",2
2209,SpongeBob,23," Ok, ok. Wait, wait. Do exactly as I do. [takes it off again] Exactly as I do. [takes it off again] Exactly. Exactly. Exactly.
",2
2210,Patrick,23," Exactly as you do. [takes lid off jar, then starts to cry] Oh, no, I broke it!
",2
2211,SpongeBob,23," No, no, Patrick, you did it!
",2
2212,Patrick,23," I did? [both cheer as Patrick throws the jar into the floor] Touchdown! I'm jarmaster!
",2
2213,SpongeBob,23," That was great, Patrick! You really got the hang of it.
",2
2214,Patrick,23," Yeah. Remember when I had my up? And I put it on the lid?
",2
2215,SpongeBob,23," Oh, yeah.
",2
2216,Patrick,23," Then I took the lid off and I thought I broke it.
",2
2217,SpongeBob,23," [laughs] Yeah.
",2
2218,Patrick,23," But I didn't. I opened the jar with my hand. And it was all because you showed me how to do it. I'm never gonna forget this.
",2
2219,SpongeBob,23," Patrick, you do exactly what I do and you'll have an award in no time. [night becomes day in SpongeBob's House then clam crows everyone up] I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. [notices Patrick dressed up like him]
",2
2220,Patrick,23," Good morning, SpongeBob.
",2
2221,SpongeBob,23," Wow. It's amazing how a simple change of clothes can make a guy look...just...like...me.
",2
2222,Patrick,23," Yup. If I'm gonna be an award winner, I've gotta dress like one.
",2
2223,SpongeBob,23," That's creepy...but flattering! I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready... [Patrick copies SpongeBob then SpongeBob stops] Huh?
",2
2224,SpongeBob,23," Well, back to the ol' grind.
",2
2225,Patrick,23," Well, back to the ol' grind.
",2
2226,SpongeBob,23," Forget my hat.
",2
2227,Patrick,23," Uhh, me, too.
",2
2228,SpongeBob,23," [SpongeBob mops the floor then puts the mop up. Patrick mops the floor but he makes the floor wet. SpongeBob comes out with a handful of plates and slips and breaks them all. Patrick follows in SpongeBob's footsteps. SpongeBob glares at him]
",2
2229,SpongeBob and Patrick,23," [at the grill, frying patties, both whistle a tune, then stop, they both wipe their foreheads] Whew! [SpongeBob drops his spatula]
",2
2230,SpongeBob,23," [laughs] Dropped my spatula. [bends down to pick it up]
",2
2231,Patrick,23," Uhh, me, too. [drops spatula and bends down to pick it up. SpongeBob takes off his hat, then Patrick takes off his, they both put their hats back on. Then they both put their hands on the grill. Patrick's hand burns after a few seconds] Ow!
",2
2232,SpongeBob,23," Aha! [shows the fake hand] You're copying me!
",2
2233,Patrick,23," Yes.
",2
2234,SpongeBob,23," Why are you doing that?
",2
2235,Patrick,23," So I can win an award like you.
",2
2236,SpongeBob,23," Well, it's annoying, so stop it!
",2
2237,Patrick,23," Stop it. [both imitate the others facial expressions]
",2
2238,SpongeBob,23," Say, you're good.
",2
2239,Patrick,23," Thanks.
",2
2240,SpongeBob and Patrick,23," Ha! Darn. [both look at each other with suspicion, while rubbing their chin] Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as...pickled fish lips!! [both cover their mouth] Sea weavle. Gorgy smorgy.
",2
2241,SpongeBob,23," [in his mind] At least I'm safe inside my mind.
",2
2242,Patrick,23," [in his mind] At least I'm safe inside my mind.
",2
2243,SpongeBob and Patrick,23," [screaming]
",2
2244,SpongeBob,23," [he and Patrick run out of the Krusty Krab] Stop copying me!
",2
2245,Patrick,23," There's no award for that.
",2
2246,Squidward,23," [leaning against the Krusty Krab sign pole, reading a newspaper, a Krusty Krab hat falls near him] Well, I guess it's safe to go in, now. [puts hat back on and walks back in]
",2
2247,SpongeBob,23," [he and Patrick are still running] Patrick, how long are you going to keep this up?
",2
2248,Patrick,23," Until I have as many awards as you.
",2
2249,SpongeBob,23," We'll see about that!
",2
2250,Patrick,23," No, we won't.
",2
2251,SpongeBob,23," [takes out a jump-rope] I'm the jump-rope champion of Bikini Bottom.
",2
2252,Patrick,23," Me, too. [takes out a jump-rope]
",2
2253,Patrick,23," Oh, no, you don't! [squeezes the rope on himself breaking his body down into smaller pieces. Then both hit a hammer on their heads]
",2
2254,SpongeBob,23," Not much fun being me, now, huh Patrick?
",2
2255,Patrick,23," Are you kidding? I used to do this way before I started copying you. [SpongeBob stops hammering his head but Patrick does not notice. Patrick hits himself faster and too hard, he stops and gets dizzy, trophies appear and spin around his head, and falls on the ground. SpongeBob runs into Patrick's rock painted as SpongeBob's house, SpongeBob gets mad and steam comes out of his head]
",2
2256,Patrick,23," My turn! [runs into the pineapple rock]
",2
2257,SpongeBob,23," [runs into his house] I wish I had the old Patrick back, but he just wants to be like me. [pushes his nose into his face and comes out of his house dressed in Patrick's normal outfit] Hi, I'm Patrick Star. I'm the laziest, pinkest starfish in Bikini Bottom and I wish I were me and not SpongeBob.
",2
2258,Patrick,23," What's so great about being a Big Pink Loser? [SpongeBob's nose pops back out] Exactly. I was never closer to an award then the minute I started copying you.
",2
2259,SpongeBob,23," But, Patrick...
",2
2260,Patrick,23," Patrick's not here!
",2
2261,Delivery Guy,23," [stops in front of SpongeBob and Patrick in truck] Trophy delivery! [he drives off and Spongebob has a package in his mouth]
",2
2262,SpongeBob,23," Another trophy?
",2
2263,Patrick,23," Oh, great! [SpongeBob opens the package] What's it for this time?
",2
2264,SpongeBob,23," 'For Doing Absolutely Nothing Longer Than Anyone Else'.
",2
2265,Patrick,23," Yay! [puts trophy on head like a hat] Eee! [both rip off their present outfit to reveal their own normal outfits.]
",2
2266,SpongeBob,23," So, what are you going to do, now?
",2
2267,Patrick,23," I'm gonna go protect my title. [jumps on his rock and falls asleep, the rock closes]
",2
2268,Narrator,23," So you thought I was kidding, huh? No, in Bikini Bottom, excellence can be found, even under a rock.",2

Zooms in on one of his bumper stickers that reads ""Don't Ask Me About My Day."" Squidward blearily looks up from his steering wheel to prepare himself for the day ahead. walks up to the front doors and SpongeBob follows him from inside, smiling. Squidward walks inside]
",2
2276,SpongeBob,24," Hey, hey Squidward, did you see me? [Squidward walks inside without saying a word] Okay, see you later, Squidinator.
",2
2277,Mr. Krabs,24," Good morning, Mr. Squidward. [Raises his eyebrows; Squidward sticks out his tongue] So, are you ready?
",2
2278,Squidward,24," To go home?
",2
2279,Mr. Krabs,24," No, to exchange gifts for Employee Brotherhood Day.
",2
2280,Squidward,24," Mr. Krabs, you pay me to stand behind this register and take orders and give change. But you could never pay me enough to act brotherly towards... [points at SpongeBob] ...that guy. [SpongeBob is washing a table with a buffer. He scrubs his face and gets it scrambled. He laughs]
",2
2281,Mr. Krabs,24," That attitude of yours is precisely why we're having this little shenanigan. Now pay attention, the lad's got a surprise for you.
",2
2282,SpongeBob,24," Squidward, in honor of employee brotherhood, I present to you a gift. [holds up a sweater] Ta-dah. [zooms in to show it's a picture of a heart with Squidward's face on it]
",2
2283,Squidward,24," ""I ♥ you...""
",2
2284,Mr. Krabs,24," Try it on, Mr. Squidward! It's got you written all over it. [laughs as Squidward has a hard time putting the sweater over his head]
",2
2285,SpongeBob,24," I wasn't sure how big to make the hole for the head, so I used a watermelon for size. [Squidward gets the sweater over his head] Do you love it?
",2

",2

",2
2288,Squidward,24," Now may I resume to my minimum-wage duties?
",2
2289,Mr. Krabs,24," After you present your brotherhood gift.
",2
2290,Squidward,24," I'll buy the little twerp a gum ball.
",2
2291,Mr. Krabs,24," Oh, no, no, no, no, lad. You know the rules; you have to make the gift.
",2
2292,Squidward,24," [walks to the doors] The only thing I'm making is for the exit. [opens up the door to see SpongeBob with a new sweater made out of a clear liquid]
",2
2293,SpongeBob,24," Is this any better, Squidward? I made this one with my tears. [sniffs. Squidward sighs and walks towards the kitchen]
",2

",2
2295,Squidward,24," Why can't I just buy something for the little weirdo?
",2
2296,Captain,24," Heave-ho! [Squidward looks and sees some pirates outside carrying some pies onto the ship] If you drop one single slice of me booty, I'll have... your booty!
",2
2297,Squidward,24," Hi, there. Those homemade pies sure look good.
",2
2298,Pirate,24," Oh, these aren't homemade. They were made in a factory... a bomb factory. They're bombs.
",2
2299,Squidward,24," Oh, well, that's too bad. I thought they were pies and I wanted to buy one. [holds up money]
",2
2300,Captain,24," Wait! [jumps down off the ship] We were just kidding about all that bomb stuff. That'll be 25 bucks, please.
",2
2301,Squidward,24," So, what flavor is it?
",2
2302,Pirates,24," [all talking at once] Cherry. Apple. Raspberry.
",2
2303,Squidward,24," Well, if it'll get old man Mr. Krabs off my back. [Squidward gives the pirate the money. Cut to Squidward placing the pie on Mr. Krabs' desk] Okay, here it is, Mr. Krabs, fresh from the oven. I'll be returning to my life now.
",2
2304,Mr. Krabs,24," Not yet. I got to make sure you did it right. [about to put a piece in his mouth] Wait a second... this would go great with some milk! [while walking to the milk, he trips over a book and the piece of pie flies into the milk, causing an explosion] So, you tried to kill me over a little new aged management, eh?
",2
2305,Squidward,24," But, Mr. Krabs, I had no idea. I can explain! [cut to inside Mr. Krabs' office]
",2
2306,SpongeBob,24," Mr. Krabs, are you okay? I heard a... wow! A pie! [looks at the card attached to it] It's from Squidward. [reading] ""To SpongeBob... Well, here you go.""
",2
2307,Squidward,24," And that's what happened.
",2
2308,Mr. Krabs,24," 25 dollars? A bomb?
",2

2317,Squidward,24," No, no! What we got... we got to call the hospital!
",2
2318,Mr. Krabs,24," Won't do any good. I've seen this before. When that pie goes up to bat, I mean, hits his lower intestine... boom!
",2
2319,Squidward,24," You've seen this before?
",2
2320,Mr. Krabs,24," Eleven times as a matter of fact. [Squidward runs over to a phone and dials the hospital]
",2
2321,Squidward,24," Yes, hello, doctor? Hospital? It won't do any good? Eleven times? [hangs up] Oh, he's a goner. How do we tell him? [both look out the window and see SpongeBob cheerfully wiping off a table, apparently having forgotten about the earlier incident]
",2
2322,Mr. Krabs,24," Don't tell him. That'll only make him feel worse. The way I see it, he's only got till sunset. Why ruin his last day on earth? The lad deserves to enjoy his final hours. [walks away]

2323,Squidward,24," [tears up] You're right, Mr. Krabs! [sobs] I'm gonna make SpongeBob's final hours the best he's ever had. And this time, there's going to be love... so much, he's going to drown in it. [opens the door then turns around, smiling] Drown in it! [walks out]

",2

",2
2328,Squidward,24," Please, don't do that.
",2
2329,SpongeBob,24," What's the part two?
",2
2330,Squidward,24," Well, what's the most fun thing you can think of? [SpongeBob takes out a list]
",2
2331,SpongeBob,24," Actually, I keep a list of the fun things I like to do. I call it my friendship list.
",2
2332,Squidward,24," Great. Uh, let me see it. [looks at the list]
",2
2333,SpongeBob,24," The things that are extra fun, I've written in red.
",2
2334,Squidward,24," Everything's in red.
",2
2335,SpongeBob,24," Yeah, I know.
",2
2336,Squidward,24," We'd better start now if we want to get through this list before you die... of anticipation.
",2
2337,SpongeBob,24," Then let's roll! [both walk out] Bye, Mr. Krabs. [Mr. Krabs cries and puts a ""Help Wanted"" sign in the window] Heads up, Squidward—looks like they're gonna replace you.
",2
2338,Squidward,24," Uh, yeah. Let's take a look at that list.
",2
2339,SpongeBob,24," Well, the first thing I want to do is show my best friend Squidward to everybody in town. [cut to SpongeBob and Squidward talking to a businessman] Hi, there, this is my best friend, Squidward. [cut to SpongeBob and Squidward talking to some kids] Hey, kids, check it out! This is my best friend, Squidward. [one of the kids throws a rock at Squidward's head. Cut to SpongeBob and Squidward walking up to a fish sitting on a bench] Hi, I want to show you my best friend, Squidward.
",2
2340,Squidward,24," Hey, Frank. [montage ends] Glad that's over.
",2
2341,SpongeBob,24," Good, cause we're onto our next activity.
",2
2342,Squidward,24," Which is...?
",2
2343,SpongeBob,24," I'm going to show my best friend Squidward to everybody in town wearing a salmon suit.
",2
2344,Squidward,24," You're going to be wearing a salmon suit?
",2
2345,SpongeBob,24," [laughs] That's a good one Squidward. [cut to Squidward in a salmon suit in front of some kids. All the kids throw rocks at Squidward. Cut to SpongeBob checking off the item on his list] Next. [SpongeBob and Squidward sit by a rock] Knock-knock jokes! Hey Squid, knock-knock.
",2
2346,Squidward,24," Who's there?
",2
2347,SpongeBob,24," I am! [laughs]
",2
2348,Squidward,24," [laughs weakly] Oh, yeah... [SpongeBob checks the knock-knock jokes off his list. Cut to SpongeBob and Squidward walking backwards]
",2
2349,SpongeBob,24," [imitates the beeping of a back up alarm] Look out, everyone, friends in reverse! [continues beeping. SpongeBob checks off this item off the list. Cut to SpongeBob and Squidward making noises with their tongues out of their mouths while moving their hands back and forth in front of their face. SpongeBob checks the item off his list. Cut to Squidward walking with SpongeBob as his face]
",2
2350,SpongeBob,24," Turn left, and... stop. See, that's what it would be like if you had me for a face.
",2
2351,Squidward,24,"  [muffled] I can't breathe. [SpongeBob checks that off his list. Cut to SpongeBob performing open-heart surgery on Squidward]
",2
2352,Squidward,24," Are you sure you should be poking it like that?
",2
2353,SpongeBob,24," Who's the doctor here? [heart squirts blood. SpongeBob checks his operation off the list as well as some other items while he laughs] The last thing on the list is...
",2
2354,Squidward,24," [with a bandage over his heart] Does it involve more dismemberment?
",2
2355,SpongeBob,24," Watch the sunset with Squidward.
",2
2356,Squidward,24," Sunset? [thinks about what Mr. Krabs said earlier in a thought balloon]
",2
2357,Mr. Krabs,24," The way I see it, the lad's got until sunset before that bomb hits his lower intestine.
",2
2358,SpongeBob,24," Hey, it's Mr. Krabs! Hi, Mr. Krabs. [Mr. Krabs cries and runs off] Okay, see you later.
",2
2359,Squidward,24," C'mon buddy, you want a sunset, you'll get a sunset.
",2
2360,SpongeBob,24," Ah, underwater sunsets sure are beautiful. Eh, Squidward?
",2
2361,Squidward,24," Yeah.
",2
2362,SpongeBob,24," Yeah, this is great, just the three of us. You, me, [a brick wall is shown between the two] ...and this brick wall that you built between us.
",2
2363,Squidward,24," Yeah. [laughs nervously]
",2
2364,SpongeBob,24," Sunsets always remind me of bowls of fruit. What do they make you think of, Squidward? [Squidward imagines SpongeBob exploding]
",2
2365,Squidward,24," Explosions... I mean, erosion. 
",2
2366,SpongeBob,24," You know, if I were to die right now in some sort of fiery explosion due to the carelessness of a friend, well, that would just be okay. [Squidward tears up. SpongeBob burps] Wow, it feels like something just dropped into my lower intestine. [smells the aroma] Hey, smells like cherry. Or maybe grape. Blueberry? [the sun starts to go down] Here it is, the sunset! I always love to count it down. Five... You do the rest, buddy.
",2
2367,Squidward,24," Four... three... two... one... [nothing happens]
",2
2368,SpongeBob,24," I guess we started too early. Let's start again.
",2
2369,Squidward,24," Five... four... three... [an explosion is heard from behind the wall] two... [cries] o-o-o-one... Well, at least I was able to make his last few hours meaningful. [he sighs] I am such a good person. [another explosion is seen behind the wall but this time, it knocks the brick wall down on top of Squidward. SpongeBob is blowing some bomb-shaped bubbles]
",2
2370,SpongeBob,24," Hey, Squidward, check this out! [Squidward gets up and mutters] Squidward, we already played babble like an idiot.
",2
2371,Squidward,24," Why are you still here?
",2
2372,SpongeBob,24," Well, since we finished everything on the list, I thought I'd make up a new one. [holds up a book that says ""Friends 4 Ever""] I already filled up this book of ideas. We should be able to finish by January.
",2
2373,Squidward,24," [slaps book away] Forget the book! I spent the whole day with you, doing all kinds of ridiculous things, because you were supposed to explode!
",2
2374,SpongeBob,24," You want me to explode?
",2
2375,Squidward,24," Yes! That's what I've been waiting for!
",2
2376,SpongeBob,24," Um, okay, I'll try. [grunts and then yells] Gary! You are gonna finish your dessert and you are gonna like it! [laughs] Now it's your turn.
",2
2377,Squidward,24," [yells and stomps on the ground] That's not what I meant, you barnacle head!
",2
2378,SpongeBob,24," Oh, good one.
",2
2379,Squidward,24," No! You were supposed to explode into a million pieces! [he flaps his arms]
",2
2380,SpongeBob,24," Why would I do that?
",2
2381,Squidward,24," Because the pie you ate was a bomb!
",2
2382,SpongeBob,24," What pie?
",2
2383,Squidward,24," The one that I left sitting on the counter this morning that I bought from pirates for 25 bucks and I didn't know it was a bomb, and you ate it... th... that pie!
",2
2384,SpongeBob,24," Pie...pie... [takes out a pie] Oh, you mean this pie! I was saving it in my pocket for us to share. Let's eat! [walks forward and trips on a rock] Oops! [pie flies into Squidward's face in slow-motion causing an explosion the size of an atomic bomb, which is a clip of test Baker, just offshore from Bikini Island]
",2
2385,Squidward,24," [now in the destroyed town] Ouch. [fade to black, episode ends]",2

2454,SpongeBob,25," A living nightmare!
",2
2455,Squidward,25," I should have known. [walks away] Well, that's it. I'm getting off the Looney Express.
",2
2456,Mr. Krabs,25," Now just 'cause you swabs haven't seen a creature like this doesn't mean it's dangerous.
",2
2457,SpongeBob,25," We tried to warn them. I can't watch. [pushes his eyes into his head]
",2
2458,Squidward,25," Get a load of the scary monster. [laughs] Monster.
",2
2459,Mr. Krabs,25," Aw, it looks harmless.
",2
2460,Squidward,25," It's kinda cute.
",2
2461,Mr. Krabs,25," It reminds me of money.

2462,Squidward,25," Monster. [both laugh until they see the butterfly up-close and personal. Their teeth and eyes fall out and they both run away]
",2
2463,SpongeBob,25," Squidward?
",2
2464,Patrick,25," Mr. Krabs? [SpongeBob screams when he sees their underwear and hat only]
",2
2465,SpongeBob,25," [screams] It ate them! And there it goes! [Wormy flies out of the Krusty Krab] First Wormy, then Squidward, Mr. Krabs! [has three finger puppets for each person] That flying monster has eaten three friends too many. We must warn the citizens! Evil has surfaced. The fate of Bikini Bottom is in our hands, Patrick. Now let's roll.
",2
2466,Patrick,25," Aye-aye, captain. [pushes a lever to make the boat sail out of the Krusty Krab. Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick on the streets]
",2
2467,SpongeBob,25," Okay, Patrick, now this is a very delicate situation. It must be treated with great care and sensitivity.

2472,Patrick,25," [using a megaphone] Attention, Bikini Bottom! There's a flying monster that's going to eat you! [everyone screams and runs away. Cut to SpongeBob waving his arms and pointing at Wormy flying by. The whole town is on fire]

2473,Realistic Fish Head,25," Attention, attention! This just in! [TV shows a real butterfly] A giant monster is attacking Bikini Bottom. [a man watching the announcement swallows his eyes and has them appear in his mouth when he screams. He runs through the wall]
",2
2474,SpongeBob,25," We did it Patrick! We saved the city. [In the background, an explosion went off] Just think what might of happened if we didn't tell everyone about the monster.

2510,Patrick,26," I'm sorry that happened to you, SpongeBob.
",2
2511,SpongeBob,26," Me, too.
",2
2512,Patrick,26," You're the most adult person I know.
",2
2513,SpongeBob,26," Thanks, Patrick.
",2
2514,Patrick,26," You know how grandmas are, they love babies. You just can't act like a baby around her.
",2
2515,SpongeBob,26," You're right, Patrick.
",2
2516,Patrick,26," Have I ever not been right? [cut to a picture of SpongeBob on a giant red firecracker, a picture of SpongeBob with a giant funnel in his mouth while Patrick holds a giant pumpkin, and a picture of SpongeBob and Patrick in black speedos while a wolf whistle is heard in the background] You're a man now, SpongeBob, and it's time you starting acting like one.
",2
2517,SpongeBob,26," Yeah! Oh, but I'm not sure I know how.
",2
2518,Patrick,26," Allow me to demonstrate. First, puff out your chest. [SpongeBob obediently puffs out his chest] Now say ""tax exemption.""
",2
2519,SpongeBob,26," Tax exemption.
",2
2520,Patrick,26," Now, you must acquire a taste for free-form jazz. [jazz music plays] Okay, SpongeBob, you're ready! [cut to both walking up on the hill facing Grandma's house] This is it. What are you going to tell Grandma?
",2
2521,SpongeBob,26," I'm a grownup.
",2
2522,Patrick,26," No ifs, ands, or buts about it.
",2
2523,SpongeBob,26," A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do.
",2
2524,Patrick,26," And then you get behind her and I'll push.
",2
2525,SpongeBob,26," Patrick, we didn't say that.
",2
2526,Patrick,26," Oh yeah, right.
",2
2527,SpongeBob,26," All we need now is the icing on the maturity cake. [takes out a suitcase] I've been growing these babies for years. [opens it to reveal sideburns. Both of them take a pair and put them on]
",2
2528,SpongeBob & Patrick,26," Sideburns. [SpongeBob knocks on Grandma's door]
",2
2529,Grandma,26," [opens door] Oh, hello, SpongeBob. What a nice surprise. Come here and give your Granny her kissy-kissy. [as she is about to kiss him, SpongeBob puts on a helmet to block it]
",2
2530,SpongeBob,26," [removes his ""Kisses Not Allowed"" helmet off his head] Sorry, grandmother, but the kissing has to stop.
",2
2531,Patrick,26," Tell her like it is, SpongeBob, no more baby stuff.
",2
2532,SpongeBob,26," He is right, Grandmother. Kisses are for babies, which I am no longer. I have grown up. It is nature's way.
",2
2533,Grandma,26," Oh, you are absolutely right.
",2
2534,SpongeBob,26," I am? I mean, of course I am.
",2
2535,Grandma,26," You will definitely not be treated like a baby around here anymore ever again.
",2
2536,SpongeBob,26," I am glad you see it my way, grandmother. [puts on a hat]
",2
2537,Grandma,26," Well, I'm glad that's settled. [holds out a tray of cookies] But what am I going to do with all these fresh baked cookies?
",2
2538,SpongeBob,26," [chuckles] Sorry, grandmother, we adults don't partake in the consumption of sweets, right, Pat... [notices Patrick isn't there] ...rick? [cut to Patrick sitting at the kitchen table]
",2
2539,Patrick,26," Keep 'em coming, Granny! [scarfs down the cookies as SpongeBob watches from a window]
",2
2540,SpongeBob,26," So much for no more baby stuff.
",2
2541,Grandma,26," And don't forget the cookie-eating hat! [puts a red hat with springs attached to yellow smiley faces on top of Patrick's head. They both laugh]
",2
2542,SpongeBob,26," Hey, that's my cookie-eating hat! I mean it was when I was a baby.[growls in frustration] [knocks on the door. His Grandma opens it]
",2
2543,Grandma,26," Well, look who's here. It's my big old adult grandson.
",2
2544,SpongeBob,26," Grandmother, I need to have a mature conversation with Mr. Patrick. [runs up to Patrick, who still eats his snack] [whispering loudly] Patrick, what do you think you're doing? Cookies? Warm milk? A bib? [points to it, which reads ""I heart Grandma""] Is that a kissy mark on your forehead? We are supposed to be adults! [bangs on the table]
",2
2545,Grandma,26," Oh, oh, no roughhousing with a full tummy. [tickles Patrick] Who's the baby?
",2
2546,Patrick,26," I'm the baby, I'm the baby, I'm the baby! [SpongeBob clears his throat] Being grown up is boring. I love being a baby. Besides, I don't get jazz.
",2
2547,SpongeBob,26," [chuckles] Poor Patrick. I almost feel sorry for you. [takes out a pipe and blows bubbles from it] Trapped in the awkward phase of diaper days... never to know the rich rewards of being a grownup. [Grandma comes back with more cookies]
",2
2548,Grandma,26," Here's a fresh batch of cookies.
",2
2549,Patrick,26," All right! [inhales them] Rewards, huh?
",2
2550,SpongeBob,26," Well, yeah, there's, eh... [sees Patrick eating cookies with his mouth open] well, let's see, we... [a cookie rolls over to his side] We went over the jazz... [Patrick grabs the cookie and eats it]
",2
2551,Patrick,26," Oh, Grandma, I'm full. [Grandma sets down another plate of cookies]
",2
2552,Grandma,26," More cookies! [Patrick uses his mouth like a vacuum and eats all the cookies. One of the cookies rolls over by SpongeBob's side. He whistles for a brief second, then checks his wristwatch]
",2
2553,SpongeBob,26," It appears to be my lunch hour. Grownups have to eat to. I guess this will have to do. [Grandma takes the cookie away]
",2
2554,Grandma,26," Oh, you don't want this baby food. How about a big piece of steamed coral? [gives him the coral]
",2
2555,SpongeBob,26," Oh yeah, uh... great. [takes a couple bites of it] Nutritious.
",2
2556,Grandma,26," Storytime! [Patrick runs to Grandma]
",2
2557,Patrick,26," Oh boy! Storytime, storytime, storytime!
",2
2558,SpongeBob,26," Storytime? [Patrick is sitting on Grandma's lap, ready to hear a story]
",2
2559,Grandma,26," You'll enjoy this, Patrick. It's a wonderful story about a magical sea leprechaun. [SpongeBob walks in] Oh, SpongeBob, you wouldn't be interested in this baby book. [drops a giant book on the floor] Here's the technical manual on routine active maintenance.
",2
2560,SpongeBob,26," Oh, uh... great. Yeah. [opens the book] Fascinating. No pictures, just the way I like it. [while eating a cookie, Patrick bites his finger leaving a big red bruise]
",2
2561,Patrick,26," [acting like a 2-year old] D'oh! My wittle finger! [sobs]
",2
2562,Grandma,26," Hold still, hold still. [kisses his finger] All better?
",2
2563,Patrick,26," [talking normally] Sorta.... [holds up his other finger] this finger hurts a little bit too. [Grandma kisses his other finger]
",2
2564,Grandma,26," How about I give you a present?
",2
2565,Patrick,26," Oh, boy, I hope it's cookies! [opens up the box to find a sweater but puts it on his head] Alright, another hat.
",2
2566,Grandma,26," No, Patrick, it's a sweater?
",2
2567,SpongeBob,26," Huh?
",2
2568,Grandma,26," With love in every stitch.
",2
2569,SpongeBob,26," No... [imagines himself in the sweater instead of Patrick. The sweater tears in half] Don't I get a present, Grandma?
",2
2570,Grandma,26," Oh, I almost forgot. [hands him some office supplies] Here's some office supplies. I didn't wrap them. I knew you wouldn't mind. [cuckoo clock strikes three again] Uh-oh, three o'clock, time for adults to go to work. Bye-bye, SpongeBob.
",2
2571,SpongeBob,26," Uh, I don't need to leave yet. I can be late for work.
",2
2572,Grandma,26," [puts a blanket over Patrick as he lays on the couch] No, no, no, that wouldn't be the adult thing to do.
",2
2573,SpongeBob,26," Alright, I guess I'll be going. I've, uh, got a lot of adult-type business to take care of, so, uh, I'll see yah later.
",2
2574,Grandma,26," Okay, thanks for stopping by, SpongeBob.
",2
2575,SpongeBob,26," Yep, that is it. Here I go.
",2
2576,Grandma,26," Come again if you get the chance. [SpongeBob opens the door]
",2
2577,SpongeBob,26," Out into the cold, grown-up world alone without a sweater.
",2
2578,Grandma,26," Toodleloo.
",2
2579,SpongeBob,26," I don't know when I'll be back.
",2
2580,Grandma,26," I know how busy you are.
",2
2581,SpongeBob,26," So, uh... that's it. [Patrick is sleeping]
",2
2582,Grandma,26," Shh, he's asleep. [SpongeBob slowly closes the door]
",2
2583,SpongeBob,26," Soo long... [closes the door but then opens it with sad eyes. His sideburns fall off of his head. He starts throwing a big tantrum] I don't wanna grow up! [holds up a giant chocolate chip cookie and snaps it in half in front of his face] I want cookies! [holds up a giant baby bottle with milk inside] and ""milkie""! [wears a sweater] I want a sweater with love in the stitches! [runs around wearing a diaper with a blue pin on it as he's putting powder in the diaper] I wanna wear ""diadies""! [rides in a wagon] I wanna ride in my wagon! [holds his giant teddy bear] I wanna cuddle-wuddle with Mister Stuffykins! [rides his old rocking horse with a sailor hat on and a lollipop] I wanna rocky-rock on my seahorsey! [holds up his bruised finger] And I want kissy-kissy on my boo-boo! [SpongeBob cries this instant as he falls on the floor in his front body, slamming his fists on the floor as if a kid was throwing a tantrum. He then rolls like a wheel. Grandma is shocked and sad for him. SpongeBob, sitting, sprays his tears in his mouth. Grandma thinks for a second. He ratchets like a lawn sprinkler, almost spinning around and sprays tears everywhere. He spins even faster and floods the whole house]
",2
2584,Grandma,26," Take it easy, SpongeBob. [picks up the still-crying SpongeBob] SpongeBob. SpongeBob! [SpongeBob starts gasping after each cry. Grandma holds his lips, stopping SpongeBob's crying] You don't have to be a baby to get ol' Grandma's love.
",2
2585,SpongeBob,26," [sniffles as he starts to feel a bit better] I don't?
",2
2586,Grandma,26," Of course not. [pulls the plug under the tears to drain it] No matter how grown-up you get, you'll always be my little baby boo. [Grandma tickles SpongeBob, then kisses his forehead] And remember, you can kiss your grandma and still be an adult. [hands SpongeBob his sideburns and a chocolate chip cookie] Here you go. [SpongeBob puts on his sideburns and eats the cookie]
",2
2587,SpongeBob,26," Thanks, Grandma. [bites the cookie] Uh, Grandma, could you not mention this to the guys down at the Krusty Krab?
",2
2588,Grandma,26," No problem. [she hugs SpongeBob. Outside, Squidward and everyone else are laughing]",2

2595,Sandy,27," There we go! [Sandy rakes a pile of leaves in the shape of Texas] SpongeBob, I got all the leaves ra... [steps on piles of leaves still on the ground] SpongeBob, what are all these leaves doing here? You said you were going to rake them!
",2
2596,SpongeBob,27," [peeks his head out of a pile of leaves he is in] I am raking the leaves.
",2
2597,Sandy,27," But they're still all over the ground!
",2
2598,SpongeBob,27," Sandy, I can't rake any faster. [picks up a leaf and starts scraping it with a tiny rake] These are big leaves. [leaf breaks into more pieces] And they keep breaking into more leaves. [Sandy pushes him away and rakes them herself] Then go scrape the salt lick or somethin'! We got to get this stuff done before it's too late! What's the big rush anyway, Sandy?
",2
2599,Sandy,27," [hanging laundry] I told ya, SpongeBob... [scrubs the birdbath with a toothbrush] I'm hibernating next week.
",2
2600,SpongeBob,27," Hibernating? What's that?
",2
2601,Sandy,27," [painting the fence] It's when I go to sleep for the whole winter.
",2
2602,SpongeBob,27," Can I do that?
",2
2603,Sandy,27," [chuckles] No, silly. It's a mammalian thing. [paints over SpongeBob's helmet]
",2
2604,SpongeBob,27," Sandy, you may not have noticed, but I is 100% ma-male.
",2
2605,Sandy,27," [cleaning her exercise wheel] Enough chitter-chatter, SpongeBob. We don't have much time left!
",2
2606,SpongeBob,27," Why, Sandy? When does your... ""carburation"" begin? [Sandy jumps down, pulling down a giant calendar with a giant x on the 8th]
",2
2607,Sandy,27," In one week!
",2
2608,SpongeBob,27," But Sandy, that only gives us 1, 2, 3... [gasps] 168 more hours of playtime!
",2
2609,Sandy,27," You're telling me. And there's still so much stuff to do! We gotta climb some things!
",2
2610,SpongeBob,27," Climb!
",2

",2
2618,SpongeBob,27," Sandy?
",2
2619,Sandy,27," What?!
",2
2620,SpongeBob,27," Sandy, I'm willing to sacrifice any of my time that I haven't already sold to Mr. Krabs to you. [Pantera playing]
",2
2621,Sandy,27," Well I'm glad, SpongeBob, 'cause for the next seven days, it's gonna be you, me, and these sweatbands! [holds them up. Cut to the giant sand mountains area. Sandy is riding a giant clam shell smashing through a sign] Yee-ha! [sliding down the mountain so fast she is now on fire. She rides past a fish with a backpack on his back. When she goes past him, he drops to the ground and rolls around cause he is on fire. She then rides past a man and a woman. The woman now wears a jogging outfit and the man is now riding a tricycle and holding a lollipop and paddleball. The woman looks at him]
",2
2622,Fish #1,27," Uh... I can explain. [Sandy flips in mid-air, still on fire]
",2
2623,Sandy,27," I'm hotter than a hickory-smoked sausage! Woo-hoo! [SpongeBob is wearing his green karate head gear and riding down the mountain on his tongue. Cut to two kids, building a sandman]
",2
2624,Girl,27," Maybe, if we sing that song, he'll come to life.
",2
2625,Billy,27," Ready?
",2
2626,Both,27," [singing] Oh, there once was a sandman... [SpongeBob rides into the sandman. a musical note pops up]
",2
2627,SpongeBob,27," Life's as extreme as you want to make it! [jumps off the mountain] Whoo!
",2
2628,Girl,27," Maybe we didn't sing it right. [SpongeBob flying toward the ground. When he hits it, two bones are sticking out]
",2
2629,SpongeBob,27," Yeah. [cut to Sandy and SpongeBob standing outside Sandy's treedome] Whew, what a workout. [pulls out his right arm and shows its damages] I'm going to be feeling this tomorrow. [his arm falls to the ground] Ow.
",2
2630,Sandy,27," I got to say, I'm impressed with you, SpongeBob. You're making this the best pre-hibernation week ever.
",2
2631,SpongeBob,27," Well, I'd better get home before Gary chews up the sofa again. [sighs as he lifts up his left leg and moves it alternately with the other over to his house. Later, it's nighttime and he is finally crawling into bed] Good night Gary. [falls asleep. Then Sandy pushes a button which launches SpongeBob out of his bed and into a lake. SpongeBob is now a block of ice. Sandy jumps in and becomes a block of ice]
",2
2632,Sandy,27," Nothing like a refreshing morning dip, huh, SpongeBob?
",2
2633,SpongeBob,27," [shivering] W-what h-happened to s-sleeping? [Sandy pulls down a calendar]
",2
2634,Sandy,27," I'll be asleep all winter! We only got three days for fun. [swims away] Well hurry now! The giant clams like to feed at this hour! [cut to SpongeBob lifting a bowling ball into a tube. Sandy blows her whistle giving the signal and SpongeBob runs to the end and picks up a few jacks before the bowling ball hits him on his head. Sandy does the same thing but the bowling ball cracks her helmet] Isn't this great?
",2
2635,SpongeBob,27," Yeah! I've never played extreme jacks before! [cut to Sandy and SpongeBob with giant q-tips]
",2
2636,Sandy,27," Ok SpongeBob, this one's going to be fun. We just whack each other with these giant ear cleaners 'til one of us falls off. [lifts hers up] On your mark... get set...
",2
2637,SpongeBob,27," Sandy, are you sure we're supposed to be standing up here?
",2
2638,Sandy,27," Go! [hits SpongeBob off the Sea Needle. SpongeBob lands on a fire hydrant. Sandy rides up on a two-seated bike] Come on, SpongeBob. We're goin' for a tandem ride through the park!
",2
2639,SpongeBob,27," Gee, that sounds safe! I mean, fun. [gets up but leaves a piece of himself on the fire hydrant. He jumps on the bike] Ok, I'm ready! I thought you said we were riding through the park, Sandy!
",2
2640,Sandy,27," I did, SpongeBob, the industrial park! [they ride into a giant factory] This is where the real action is! [Sandy pedals on barbed wire] This part gets pretty technical! Yee-haw! Now for the speed course. Hold on! [they ride through a conveyor belt with a giant crunching mouth at the end] I hope we make it! [bike begins to fall to the ground fast. SpongeBob screams] I'm havin' fun, too! [as they hit the ground, SpongeBob melts into a puddle. Sandy tosses a fishing rod on him] Wake up, slowpoke. [scene scrolls over to show a plane] We're going fly-fishing. [rimshot]
",2
2641,SpongeBob,27," [thinking] This squirrel's trying to kill me! Any more of these stunts and I'll be reduced to a puddle! [sees his shoe floating] Wait a minute, I've got to talk my way out of this! Sandy, I think I need to tell you something.
",2
2642,Sandy,27," What is it?
",2
2643,SpongeBob,27," Well, it's just that I'm feeling sort of... [his mouth melts away from his eyes. He pulls it back up] I just feel like maybe I need to... [his mouth melts away again. Sandy puts her hand over his mouth]
",2
2644,Sandy,27," Hold that thought, SpongeBob! 'Cause it's time for a down-home favorite! [holds up a piece of hay. Pantera plays again] Find the hay in the needle stack! [throws it in a giant pile of needles. Cut to inside the needle pile where SpongeBob is covered in needles and still getting poked with them] Did you find it?
",2
2645,SpongeBob,27," Not yet.
",2
2646,Sandy,27," Well I'm going to look over here.
",2
2647,SpongeBob,27," You do that. [SpongeBob digs a hole underground then emerges]
",2
2648,Sandy,27," Found it, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob runs away] Come on. Best two out of three.
",2
2649,SpongeBob,27," Gotta hide! Gotta hide! Home? No. Gary can't keep a secret. [looks at Patrick's rock] Under a rock? It's so original! [as he jumps for the rock, his pants get stuck on a small coral bush]
",2
2650,Sandy,27," SpongeBob?! [SpongeBob struggles to get free and eventually does but leaves his pants stuck on the plant] SpongeBob? [Sandy walks up to SpongeBob's pants] Where are you, little square dude? [gasps] SpongeBob's tie! And all his other little dressins! But... but... he always folds his clothes before running around in the nude! Something terrible must have happened to him! [crunching and munching] Alright, listen up, y'all! I'm rounding up a search party! SpongeBob's gone missing! [Squidward smiles at Mr. Krabs, thinking that Mr. Krabs will not look for SpongeBob. Mr. Krabs looks at him]
",2
2651,Mr. Krabs,27," [Squidward frowns because they will search for SpongeBob] Man the lifeboats!
",2
2652,Sandy,27," Alpha Team, you search uptown. Gold Team searches downtown. Any questions?
",2
2653,Frank,27," Gold Team rules!
",2
2654,Sandy,27," Now get movin'! [crowd yelling][Fred put a Lost poster with a picture of SpongeBob] SpongeBob? [Cuts to Sandy and the search party] Someone look up there. [Sandy pops out of a sewer] Put your doors, and friends into it! [cut to searching in the sulfur fields] Come on! He could be anywhere in these sulfur fields! [Clay looks in a spout]
",2
2655,Clay,27," Hey SpongeBob! [a blast of sulfur hits him in the face] Well…,at least I still have my personality.
",2
2656,Sandy,27," Check in this here moist cave! [Old Man Jenkins, Nathaniel and Scooter walk in shouting for SpongeBob then run out, realizing the cave is actually a three-eyed sea elephant]
",2
2657,Sandy,27," Status report!
",2
2658,Small Fish,27," [covered in Poison Sea Urchins] He's not at the Poison Sea Urchin cove.
",2
2659,Sandy,27," Well, look again!
",2
2660,Vera,27," [covered in leeches] He's not at the leech farm.
",2
2661,Sandy,27," Well, look again!
",2
2662,Squidward,27," He's not in my thoughts.
",2
2663,Sandy,27," Well, think again! [cut to Sandy talking into a megaphone] Attention Bikini Bottom, the time has come to double, no, triple our efforts!
",2
2664,Squidward,27," How about a break?! We've been at it for days!
",2
2665,Debbie,27," Think about the children!
",2
2666,Sandy,27," That's a good idea! Use the children to crawl into small places you couldn't normally reach.
",2
2667,Frank,27," [whispering to Sadie] This is a load of barnacles.
",2
2668,Sandy,27," I heard that!! No one's going anywhere until we find SpongeBob!
",2
2669,Frank,27," Uh... uh, wait! [picks up Francis] Uh, here he is!
",2
2670,Sandy,27," That ain't SpongeBob! SpongeBob is square!
",2
2671,Francis,27,"  [in a poor imitation of SpongeBob] I'm ready! I'm ready!
",2
2672,Sandy,27," No you ain't! [Clay holds up a box of Kelp-O]
",2
2673,Clay,27," I found SquareBob!
",2
2674,Sandy,27," That's just a cereal box. Besides, he's yellow.
",2
2675,Charlie,27," [holds up a banana] Uh... here he is! Hey, can I go home now? [Sandy becomes annoyed]
",2
2676,Tina,27," [points up] Oh, look! He's up in the sky! [Sandy happily looks up, but SpongeBob's not in the sky]
",2
2677,Sandy,27," He's not...huh? [everyone is gone] They must have gone to search some more. [Sandy continues searching for SpongeBob] SpongeBob, where are you?! [lifts up a house] You under there? [lifts up another house] Nope. [lifts up another house where the fish from before is at]
",2
2678,Fish #1,27," Uhh, I can explain.
",2
2679,Fish #9,27," [everyone is looking at Sandy] That squirrel's gone crazy!
",2
2680,Woman,27," But she'll never look under a rock.
",2
2681,SpongeBob,27," [laughs] You said it! Sandy'll never find us! [everyone glares at SpongeBob and throws him out] Hey wait, you don't understand!
",2
2682,Squidward,27," [pops out from under the rock] Oh look, it is I, SpongeBob, out here in the open. [Sandy turns around]
",2
2683,Sandy,27," SpongeBob?
",2
2684,SpongeBob,27," [loud bang] C'mon, let me back in! You don't understand! [Sandy hugs SpongeBob]
",2
2685,Sandy,27," Oh, SpongeBob, I was so worried! I thought something terrible happened! [grabs his arm] Come on. There's just enough time to go atom smashing. [Sandy runs but SpongeBob is not moving]
",2
2686,SpongeBob,27," Sandy, wait!
",2
2687,Sandy,27," There's no time to wait! Hibernation! [pulls on SpongeBob's arm]

2688,SpongeBob,27," Sandy, you've got to make time! This is important! [Sandy lets go of SpongeBob's arm] I...am a man! [holds up a razor] OK, Sandy, I...I...I...I...I can't play with you anymore! I just can't take the games! They're tearing me apart! [rips off his nose and throws it on the ground then holds onto Sandy's legs crying] There, I said it! Now just promise we can still be friends. Please, Sandy? This isn't easy, I...

2689,SpongeBob,27," Sandy? [chuckles a little] I never thought I'd say it, but thank Neptune for hibernation! [laughs and falls asleep]

",2
2700,Patrick,29," Look, she's on the Eating Channel.
",2
2701,Sandy,29," [On TV. Sandy fills her cheeks with acorns and swallows, wincing in pain as the giant mass of acorns passes down her long, thin neck and into her small torso, deforming it as it goes] Howdy! [eats more nuts] If y'all are watching this, that means I'm asleep for the winter. This sleep is called hibernation. [""HIBERNATION"" appears on the bottom of the screen. Sandy eats more nuts] During hibernation, animals don't like to be woken up. So do not disturb. [sternly] That means you, SpongeBob.
",2
2702,Patrick,29," We better put these on.
",2
2703,SpongeBob,29," Never mind, Pat. Sandy said not to come in. Let's am-scray.
",2
2704,Patrick,29," When are you gonna learn, SpongeBob? ""No"" means ""yes""!
",2
2705,SpongeBob,29," Patrick, listen, how many times do we have to-?
",2
2706,Patrick,29," SpongeBob, look at this! [snow falls in and covers the bottom of the treedome. SpongeBob gasps and walks in]
",2
2707,SpongeBob,29," What is this stuff? [pan around the treedome]
",2
2708,Patrick,29," It's a vast, swirling wonderland of sparkling white pleasure. Let it fill your senses with cascading, fluffy pillows of excitement and comfort as you've never felt before.
",2
2709,SpongeBob,29," [teary-eyed] Wow, Pat, that was beautiful!
",2
2710,Patrick,29," What, I was just reading this candy bar wrapper, see? [he hands SpongeBob the wrapper. SpongeBob gasps]
",2
2711,SpongeBob,29," Patrick! Put your helmet back on! [Pat has taken his helmet off and is eating the snowflakes] You know there's no water in Sandy's house!
",2
2712,Patrick,29," It's okay, SpongeBob. This stuff is water! Look! [Patrick lets a flake land on his tongue and it melts into water]
",2
2713,SpongeBob,29," I guess you're right. It's okay here!
",2
2714,Patrick,29," Take it off. No one's looking. [SpongeBob does so and the two cheer and burrow themselves in the snow. They pop back up with noses made of snow. Then, they hear a weird sound] SpongeBob, did you hear that?
",2
2715,SpongeBob,29," I think it came from Sandy's tree.
",2
2716,Patrick,29," That is one tired tree.
",2
2717,SpongeBob,29," Let's check it out. [cut to inside Sandy's tree where SpongeBob and Patrick come in. They both gasp] Look what's in Sandy's bed! [they walk over to the bed, where Sandy is asleep in hibernation form, looking like some weird squirrel-like monster]
",2
2718,Patrick,29," Looks like an over-inflated Sandy doll!
",2
2719,SpongeBob,29," I think this thing is Sandy.
",2
2720,Patrick,29," Hibernation must mean the opposite of beauty sleep.
",2
2721,Sandy,29," [snoring, talking in sleep] I've had enough of your dastardly deeds, Dirty Dan. I'm gonna get you and your partner, Pinhead Larry or my name ain't Sheriff... Sandy... [snores]
",2
2722,SpongeBob,29," [giggles] She must be dreaming about Texas outlaws. [the two giggle] Look out Sandy, I'm Dirty Dan.
",2
2723,Sandy,29," I'm gonna catch you and throw you in jail at taxpayers' expense.
",2
2724,SpongeBob,29," Oh, you better run faster, Sandy.
",2
2725,Patrick,29," Yeah! I'm getting away! Faster! [Sandy moves her arms and legs]
",2
2726,SpongeBob,29," Hurry, we're getting in a taxi!
",2
2727,Patrick,29," Faster, faster! [the two giggle]
",2
2728,Sandy,29," I'll get you two. You're nothing but pure evil! Just like newspaper comics... [snores off to sleep, the two giggle again]
",2
2729,SpongeBob,29," Come on, Patrick. We shouldn't disturb her anymore.
",2
2730,Patrick,29," That's not disturbing. This is disturbing! [Patrick struggles to create a talking face that protrudes from his back] Hi there, SpongeBob. My name is Patback.
",2
2731,SpongeBob,29," Ha! That is really disturbing!
",2
2732,Patrick,29," Uh, SpongeBob?
",2
2733,SpongeBob,29," [stops laughing] Huh? [Sandy is really mad now, she's steaming and roaring. Sponge and Pat run, but Sandy has them both by the their underwear and gives them an extreme wedgie. They run in mid-air anyway]
",2
2734,Patrick,29," Faster, SpongeBob! She's gaining on us!
",2
2735,SpongeBob,29," [Crying from the pain of the wedgie.] Sandy! No! Stop!
",2
2736,Sandy,29," I warned ya, Dirty Dan! Now, you've just crossed the border into Hurtville!
",2
2737,SpongeBob,29," Sandy, it's us, your friends! SpongeBob and Patrick!
",2
2738,Patrick,29," Please, Sandy, I can't afford dry cleaning!
",2
2739,Sandy,29," Gonna skin y'all and make a pair of size six...boots... [she falls asleep and drops the two. They inch away and see Sandy fall back into her bed]
",2
2740,Patrick,29," Fun's over.
",2
2741,SpongeBob,29," Whew, we sure don't want to wake her up again. Too bad we don't have any earplugs to put on her.
",2
2742,Patrick,29," Yeah, all's I got is this bellybutton lint. [he takes the lint out of its designated area. It somehow forms into the shape of earmuffs]
",2
2743,SpongeBob,29," All right, Pat! [he takes them and crawls over to the bed. Pat follows. Sponge puts the earmuffs on Sandy]
",2
2744,Sandy,29," I'm gonna rip your arms off and.... flapjacks? [snores]
",2
2745,SpongeBob,29," Well, that oughta work.
",2
2746,Patrick,29," [loudly] Hey Sandy, does it work? [Sponge and Pat look at each other and raise their eyebrows repeatedly and in symmetry]
",2
2747,SpongeBob,29," Hey Sandy, if you can't hear us, don't say anything!
",2
2748,Patrick,29," Hey, Sandy! Don't wake up! [the two giggle, Sponge holds a megaphone up to Sandy's head and yells into it]
",2
2749,SpongeBob,29," See ya later, Sheriff Sandy! [laughs, the two run down to the snowy plains and act like outlaws, with that drawling voice] You're under arrest!
",2
2750,Patrick,29," You'll never catch me! [he giggle and makes a snowball and throws it at SpongeBob's face. They both laugh. Pat starts to make another one, but he's hit by a giant mound of snow. SpongeBob stands on a giant snow cannon] Hey that's not fair! Cowboys couldn't afford cannons.
",2
2751,SpongeBob,29," They couldn't afford station wagons either! [A giant snowball shaped like a station wagon lands on Patrick]
",2
2752,Patrick,29," Nice paneling.
",2
2753,SpongeBob,29," All right, Pinhead. Your time is up! [cut to Pat, who looks like a cone-head]
",2
2754,Patrick,29," Who you calling Pinhead? I want to be Dirty Dan!
",2
2755,SpongeBob,29," What makes you think you can be Dirty Dan?
",2
2756,Patrick,29," I'm dirty. [he's hit on the head by a giant snow shovel that Sponge has]
",2
2757,SpongeBob,29," I say I'm Dirty Dan. [Pat runs off and returns with a giant bat with a nail in it made of snow]
",2
2758,Patrick,29," I say I'm Dirty Dan! [whacks SpongeBob with it]
",2
2759,SpongeBob,29," [whacks Patrick again] I say I'm Dirty Dan!
",2
2760,Patrick,29," [whacks SpongeBob] I'm Dirty Dan.
",2
2761,SpongeBob,29," [whacks Patrick] I'm Dirty Dan!
",2
2762,Patrick,29," [whacks SpongeBob] I'm Dirty Dan.
",2
2763,SpongeBob,29," [whacks Patrick] I'm Dirty Dan!
",2
2764,Patrick,29," [whacks SpongeBob] I'm Dirty Dan.
",2
2765,SpongeBob,29," [whacks Patrick] I'm Dirty Dan!
",2
2766,Patrick,29," [whacks SpongeBob] I'm Dirty Dan.
",2
2767,SpongeBob,29," [whacks Patrick] I'm Dirty Dan!
",2
2768,Patrick,29," [whacks SpongeBob] I'm Dirty Dan.
",2
2769,SpongeBob,29," [whacks Patrick] I'm Dirty Dan! [Sandy's eyes snap open] [Cut back to outside]
",2
2770,Patrick,29," [whacks SpongeBob] I'm Dirty Dan. [SpongeBob sees something behind Patrick and screams in terror] Screaming will get you no- [Sandy reaches out and grabs the top of Patrick's head and rips it off. Sandy huffs and growls as she stands behind Patrick, towering over him with sharpened teeth bared in a snarl]
",2
2771,Sandy,29," [breathing heavily] Which one of you fellers is the real Dirty Dan?!
",2
2772,Patrick,29," Uh? I am? [ Bad idea, as Sandy promptly backhands him and sends him flying across the treedome]
",2
2773,SpongeBob,29," Patrick! [Pat slams against the dome hard enough to leave a dent and little drumsticks float around his head]
",2
2774,Patrick,29," Hot wings? [cut back to Sandy, who rounds on a cowering and terrified SpongeBob.]
",2
2775,Sandy,29," Okay, Pinhead Larry, now you get yours! [SpongeBob's pupils shrink in fear and he screams and legs it seconds before Sandy's fist obliterates where he was just sitting. Sandy throws her head back and bellows] Pinhead! [SpongeBob whimpers and runs, Sandy is close behind. SpongeBob later doesn't seem to be going far because he's right in front of Sandy on the exercise wheel. He slips and gets flung across the wheel. He flies off and slams into the picnic table, leaving a giant crater in its place. Sandy leans over the crater] Now you're gonna pay for those crimes, Pinhead! [SpongeBob picks up a wood board]
",2
2776,SpongeBob,29," Sandy, stay back. I'm warning ya! [Sandy roars right in Sponge's face] Okay, I warned ya! [SpongeBob throws the wooden board, Patrick pops up beside Sandy]
",2
2777,SpongeBob,29," Let's get out of here before Sandy wakes up again! [the two run to the door and SpongeBob tries to open it, but his hands slip off the wheel and accidentally hits Patrick in the face]
",2
2778,Patrick,29," Ouch! [covers his eyes in pain]
",2
2779,SpongeBob,29," Sorry, Patrick, but the door is slippery! It's frozen shut!
",2
2780,Patrick,29," Let me have a try. [he goes up to the door and spits on both hands, preparing to open the door] Open sesame! [nothing happens, Patrick shrugs] Well, I've done all I can do.
",2
2781,SpongeBob,29," Then we're stuck in here? until the door thaws? in spring.
",2
2782,Patrick,29," Barnacles. [cut to much later, where Sponge and Pat are completely buried in snow, shivering and blue] Is it spring yet?
",2
2783,SpongeBob,29," N-n-n-no. [Pat and Sponge's snow covering on their faces breaks off]
",2
2784,Patrick,29," I'm so cold that I'm shivering! [a piece of Pat's side of his head cracks off, revealing his brain. Sponge snaps off his two nose drippings and clicks them together]
",2
2785,SpongeBob,29," I'm so cold that I can use my nose drippings as a pair of chopsticks! 
",2
2786,Patrick,29," I'm so cold that...I'm shivering!
",2
2787,SpongeBob,29," Maybe we should build a fire. I got it! We'll burn the bark from Sandy's tree! [Sponge begins to pull a strip of bark off the tree but he's stopped by Sandy's booming voice]
",2
2788,Sandy,29," [off-screen] You're gonna be wearing an iron lung when I'm through with you, Pinhead! [Sponge quickly puts the strip back on and puts masking-tape on it. Sponge goes back to Pat]
",2
2789,SpongeBob,29," The fire's not gonna happen, Patrick. I don't get it! How does Sandy survive these intense conditions every year?
",2
2790,Patrick,29," Maybe she just ignores it.
",2
2791,SpongeBob,29," Maybe?
",2
2792,Patrick,29," Maybe?
",2
2793,SpongeBob,29," Maybe it's her fur! [cut to a shot of a real-life squirrel]
",2
2794,SpongeBob and Patrick,29," Yeah! [cut to inside the tree where Sponge and Pat marvel at Sandy's fur]
",2
2795,SpongeBob,29," Look at all that warm, toasty fur!
",2
2796,Patrick,29," It's like a gold mine, but with fur. [SpongeBob slowly prepares to pluck a hair off Sandy]
",2
2797,SpongeBob,29," Carefully...carefully? [Pat smacks him]
",2
2798,Patrick,29," Come on, do it! I'm freezing here!
",2
2799,SpongeBob,29," All right, all right, hang on a second! [he plucks one hair off and Sandy jumps up from her sleep and roars ferociously. Then goes back to sleep] That should be enough, right? [Pat takes the hair]
",2
2800,Patrick,29," Sponge, I'm a big man. A big, BIG man!
",2
2801,SpongeBob,29," Well, I guess I've lived a full life! [he plucks one more hair, causing the same reaction with Sandy]
",2
2802,Patrick,29," This is taking too long! I want the warm NOW! [he takes a piece of masking tape, places it on Sandy]
",2
2803,SpongeBob,29," Pat, no! [Patrick rips a patch of Sandy's fur off with the tape, leaving a patch of bare skin. Sandy roars and goes back to sleep]
",2
2804,SpongeBob,29," Pat, are you crazy?! [we see Pat has placed the fur on his forehead]
",2
2805,Patrick,29," No, I'm warm.
",2
2806,SpongeBob,29," Let me see that roll of tape.
",2
2807,Patrick,29," Man, that fur really hits the spot! No more frozen armpits. [he lifts his arm up, revealing fur under it]
",2
2808,SpongeBob,29," And this eyebrow/goatee combo works like a charm. This is the best idea we've ever had.
",2
2809,Patrick,29," You said it!
",2
2810,SpongeBob,29," I'm ready for the longest, coldest winter ever!
",2
2811,Both,29," Bring it on!
",2
2812,SpongeBob,29," Spring?
",2
2813,Sandy,29," [off screen. yawns] Wow, spring already?
",2
2814,SpongeBob,29," Tartar sauce! The lock is still frozen!
",2
2815,Sandy,29," [off-screen] I sure can't wait to go outside and warm my fur!
",2
2816,Sandy,29," Oh look, it's SpongeBob and Patrick!
",2
2817,Sandy,29," Hey, guys!
",2
2818,SpongeBob,29," It's okay, Sandy. Squirrel pattern baldness is quite common in small mammals! [Pat hides his furry forehead piece. Sandy is really ticked now]
",2
2819,Sandy,29,"  [growling with fury] SpongeBob... Patrick...
",2
2820,SpongeBob,29," Don't worry, Sandy, we've got you covered.
",2
2821,Sandy,29," [giggles] More lemonade, boys? [pan out to see that Patrick is curled around Sandy's head and SpongeBob is curled around Sandy's body, in order to cover up her bald pink hide. The two take a glass]
",2
2822,SpongeBob & Patrick,29," Thanks, Sandy.
",2
2823,Sandy,29, Spring sure is lovely.,2

But more importantly, this is the last test for the year, [cut to a shot of SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff's car coming straight to the camera] and if SpongeBob does not pass this one, it means [starts going into a screaming tone] another whole year of boating school! [Shows a static scene as SpongeBob crashes into the camera and glass breaks. Back on regular view, the cameraman is seen to have fallen over. Narrator groans.]
",2
2831,SpongeBob,30," What happened?
",2
2832,Mrs. Puff,30," Oh, nothing SpongeBob, you just struck another pedestrian. [writes on clipboard] Minus 20 more points.
",2

[Mrs. Puff pleads Sponge to stop as Sponge knocks over a whole row of cones, knocks through a brick wall and crashes in front of the school's main building. The dust clears]
",2
2839,SpongeBob,30," OK, Mrs. Puff, what's my final score?
",2
2840,Mrs. Puff,30," 6.
",2
2841,SpongeBob,30," Whoo! And how many do I need to pass?

2846,Mrs. Puff,30," 600. You need 600 to pass. You got 6.
",2
2847,SpongeBob,30," Don't worry, I'll be all right Mrs. Puff. Besides, this means that I get to be in your class for a whole 'nother year! [he slams his fist down, which causes a piece of the motor to fly upward] Well, see you next Tuesday! [Sponge walks off and the piece crashes on Mrs. Puff. She inflates like she always does when Sponge crashes. SpongeBob runs out to his unicycle-like bike] Yeah! [singing] I'm gonna get my driver's license and it's only gonna take one more year, one more year, one more superduper year. [goes around in circles on his bike] One more super-spectacular, extra-magical, extra-fantastical year! [Mrs. Puff looks on, still inflated]
",2
2848,SpongeBob,30," What was that, Mrs. Puff? [Mrs. Puff runs over and shakes him in joy]
",2
2849,Mrs. Puff,30," Extra credit, SpongeBob! The extra credit! [laughing wildly] I still have a chance! I mean, you still have a chance.
",2
2850,SpongeBob,30," What's extra credit?
",2
2851,Mrs. Puff,30," It's when you get credit for the things you weren't able to do before.
",2
2852,SpongeBob,30," [singing] Oh….. [cut to Sponge at his desk]
",2
2853,Mrs. Puff,30," Now, are we ready for that extra credit?
",2
2854,SpongeBob,30," Extra credit!
",2
2855,Mrs. Puff,30," That's the spirit. So all you have to do to earn your extra credit and pass my class and never have to go anywhere near this school again, is to write a 10-word sentence on what you've learned in boating school.
",2
2856,SpongeBob,30," But I've learned so many things.
",2
2857,Mrs. Puff,30," Just pick one, I don't care which. Here, I'll help you get started. [SpongeBob writes what she says] ""What I learned in boating school is…"" There! That's already 7 words! Only 3 more!
",2
2858,SpongeBob,30," [writing] L… e… a… r… [pencil snaps] Oh, barnacles.
",2
2859,Mrs. Puff,30," What's wrong?
",2
2860,SpongeBob,30," Got to sharpen my pencil. [Sponge whistles as he walks to the sharpener. He then sharpens it multiple times to get just the right sharpness. Mrs. Puff begins to sweat. Sponge is finally satisfied and walks back to his desk] N… e… [pencil breaks again, he walks to the sharpener again, Mrs. Puff stops him, grabs the pencil and holds out a pen]
",2
2861,Mrs. Puff,30," Give me that! Here's a pen.
",2
2862,SpongeBob,30," A pen! One of the most permanent of all writing utensils. [walks back to desk singing] Gonna write an essay, that's what I say. [SpongeBob finishes] There.
",2
2863,Mrs. Puff,30," Fantastic, let me see it.
",2
2864,SpongeBob,30," No, wait! I changed my mind! [erases some stuff out]
",2
2865,Mrs. Puff,30," I'm sure whatever you've written is fine, just let me see. [Sponge jumps on top of his paper]
",2
2866,SpongeBob,30," Don't look! It's not ready.
",2
2867,Mrs. Puff,30," It's so simple, only 10 words! ""What I learned in boating school is blankity, blankity, [her eyes grow bulging veins] Blank!""

",2
2871,Mrs. Puff,30," You only need 3… more… words! [the desk finally collapses and breaks. Mrs. Puff reaches for the essay] OK, let me see what you've written. [SpongeBob grabs on]
",2
2872,SpongeBob,30," It's not ready yet.
",2
2873,Mrs. Puff,30," It's OK, SpongeBob. Show the teacher what you've written.

2876,SpongeBob,30," No!
",2
2877,Mrs. Puff,30," Let me see it! [the page rips in half. Mrs. Puff grabs Sponge's piece and attempts to read it] ""What I learned in boating school is…"" Uh… [on the page, it says 'What I learned in boating school is how to drive.' 'School,' 'how' and 'drive are crossed out and below are pictures of a boat, Sponge and a jellyfish] Well, the rest doesn't matter! [throws the 2 pieces on the floor] You pass! [laughs] You pass!

2885,Fish,30," [crushed by the bus when SpongeBob hits it] Ow!
",2
2886,Partygoers,30," Harris, happy birthday! [SpongeBob runs over them] My leg!
",2
2887,News Reporter,30," So much destruction...this reporter asks, ""Why?"" Local consensus places the blame on this negligent, selfish driving instructor who- [SpongeBob runs him over] Oof!
",2
2888,SpongeBob,30," La la la la!
",2
2889,Reporter,30," Let's- not- use that take. [Fades to reality]
",2
2890,Mrs. Puff,30," That's preposterous. He did the extra credit. There's no need to worry. He doesn't even have a boat to drive. [Later that night while walking home] Now to go home and have the rest of that pasta.
",2
2891,The SquarePants',30," Surprise!
",2
2892,SpongeBob,30," To the greatest teacher ever!
",2
2893,Mr. SquarePants,30," Thank you, Mrs Puff. I know I speak for everyone when I say that we consider you a member of the SquarePants family. [kisses her hand for a long while]
",2
2894,Mrs. SquarePants,30," I think you made your point, Dear.
",2
2895,Mr. SquarePants,30," Ahem. [blushes, and walks back to the family] Mrs. Puff, we were starting to think SpongeBob was never going to get his license. But you never gave up on him, you never quit, you never took the easy way out!
",2
2896,Mrs. Puff,30," Well, I...Okay.
",2
2897,Mrs. SquarePants,30," We wanted to make sure Mrs. Puff, the greatest driving teacher in the world, was here to see this...
",2
2898,Mrs. Puff,30," See what?
",2
2899,Mrs. Puff and SpongeBob,30," A brand new boatmobile?!
",2
2900,SpongeBob,30," For me...? [faints and hits the cake, cutting out a perfect square. The family is in the car ready to drive away with SpongeBob still passed out in the backseat]
",2
2901,Mrs. SquarePants,30," Don't worry, Mrs. Puff...He'll be driving by tomorrow! Toodle-Loo!
",2
2902,Mrs. Puff,30," What have I done?! Everyone will know I let him slide through school! I'll have to move to new city, start a new boating school with a new name! No. Not again. I've got to end this before it begins.
",2
2903,Mr. SquarePants,30," You took quite a buster there, Son.
",2
2904,SpongeBob,30," What I learned in Boating School today is!
",2
2905,Mr. SquarePants,30," We're gonna hafta hold off on the driving there for a while, son.
",2
2906,Mrs. SquarePants,30," That's right Honey. Now, just stay in bed, and no going near the boat!
",2
2907,SpongeBob,30," Hi, Boaty. [he runs his hand on the side of the boat and gasps] Boaty, you're cold! [he stands up and lays his socks on the side of the door] Take my socks. [he jumps on the side and hugs it] Oh Boaty, I'm always going to take care of you. You're the best boat in the deep blue sea! [he kisses the throttle lever, sighs, then falls asleep. On the horizon, a shifty dark figure runs by. It's Mrs. Puff, wearing a black ski mask. She peeks over and jumps into the boat, checking to see if the coast is clear]
",2
2908,Mrs. Puff,30," I hope I still remember how to do this. [she takes out a purple balloon and blows it up. She then forms it into a balloon animal and snickers to herself] Oh yeah… [she starts the boat and drives off. What she doesn't know is that she's sitting on an asleep SpongeBob. He wakes up and sees the sky moving]
",2
2909,SpongeBob,30," Hey, I'm driving! [the two notice each other and scream. Mrs. Puff skids off the road for a bit, then returns to normal. SpongeBob jumps up] Who are you and what are you doing with my boat? And why are you wearing that ski mask?! Because you're not skiing! [gasp] Oh my gosh, I know who you are!
",2
2910,Mrs. Puff,30," [nervous] No, you don't! You don't know who I am!
",2
2911,SpongeBob,30," Yes I do! I know that you're...a boat-jacker! I never thought I'd have to use this pepper spray. [takes it out. He sprays, but it's pointed the wrong way and it gets in his eyes and he screams] Somebody help me! Somebody help me! [Mrs. Puff kicks SpongeBob out of the boat]
",2
2912,Mrs. Puff,30," Sorry SpongeBob, but it was for your own good. [we see SpongeBob supposedly running next to the boat, but he's actually riding his bike. Mrs. Puff speeds up faster and loses him]
",2
2913,SpongeBob,30," Give me back my boat! [SpongeBob finally catches up to Mrs. Puff and slaps his hand on the windshield. He grabs with both hands and jumps up. Mrs. Puff skids and swerves to get him off but he's not budging] You'd better stop this boat! [Mrs. Puff slams the brake and SpongeBob falls to the ground. He's still hanging on and running] I'm… not… letting… go! Nothing will stop me! Not even… [gasps. He sees a sign reading…] Giant clams?! [so, SpongeBob is dragged through a field of giant clams. He comes out with a bunch of pieces missing from him] I'm… not… letting… go… not even for… [gasps, when he sees another sign for…] Cheese graters?! [so he skids through the cheese graters. Now he's just three yellow sponge strands with arms] If you think I'll let go just for a little… [he then approaches the most dreaded sign of them all…] educational television?! Oh-no! [cut back to Mrs. Puff as she hears SpongeBob's screams]
",2
2914,SpongeBob as Radio,30," And now back to KRUD with all of your personal ""you won't get away with stealing my car!"" hits. [Mrs. Puff screams as SpongeBob squeezes out of the box and jumps on Mrs. Puff. They get into a giant brawl and the car goes out of control. Two cops look on]
",2
2915,Cop 1,30," Hey, look. [the car then flies off a cliff and straight for the squad car. The two policemen scream as they are now scared out of their wits. While plummeting, SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff are still brawling]
",2
2916,SpongeBob,30," I'd never let you have this boat! Not even if you were… [he rips off the ski mask, revealing who the culprit is] … Mrs. Puff? [SpongeBob flaps his lips in disbelief in a hypnotic background as the car crashes into the police car. Seconds later, the siren goes off. Later, SpongeBob is calling Mrs. Puff on the phone. Every time a person talks, it cuts to them] So, how's it going, Mrs. Puff?
",2
2917,Mrs. Puff,30," Uh, SpongeBob? I'd like to… apologize. I never should have passed you. You really weren't ready.
",2
2918,SpongeBob,30," So, I guess I got to give my license back, huh?
",2
2919,Mrs. Puff,30," I hear Mrs. Flounder is starting a new class Monday morning.
",2
2920,SpongeBob,30," You kidding? You're the only teacher for this student [cut to see that Mrs. Puff is talking to SpongeBob from jail, through that visiting window]. And besides, the warden said she'll let you go early, if you do her a favor?
",2
2921,Mrs. Puff,30," What's that? [pan out from the jail exterior]
",2
2922,SpongeBob,30, [from inside] Free driving lessons! [laughs],2

2954,Patrick,31," FRUH-FRUH-FRUH-FRO-FRUH-FRUH-FRO-FRUH-FRO!
",2
2955,SpongeBob,31," It appears to be some sort of prison chamber... [licks the chamber] ...made out of frozen tarter sauce. This is incredible. Next to the Dirty Bubble, the evil ManRay is the all-time greatest arch nemesis of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. I have so many questions to ask him. [Patrick pulls the lever down to UNFREEZE] Pat, what are you doing? We're not supposed to touch anything!
",2
2956,Patrick,31," But you said you had a question.
",2
2957,SpongeBob,31," We could get in trouble.
",2
2958,Patrick,31," Well, that's not a question. [they both argue when ManRay's eyes start to light up]
",2
2959,SpongeBob,31," He said not to touch anything and that includes unfreezing a super-villain! [pulls level up back to FREEZE]
",2
2960,Man Ray,31," I'm free! Hahaha!
",2
2961,SpongeBob,31," Uh, actually, Mr Man Ray, sir, only your head is free.
",2
2962,Man Ray,31," By the supreme authority of wickedness, I, the evil Man Ray, command you to release me from this frozen prison at once.
",2
2963,SpongeBob,31," Well, uhh, Mr. evil ManRay sir, we can't do that.
",2
2964,Man Ray,31," Why.. Not?!
",2
2965,SpongeBob,31," Because you're evil!
",2
2966,Man Ray,31," You mean, if I was good then you'd let me go?
",2
2967,SpongeBob,31," Yeah, sure, why not?
",2
2968,Man Ray,31," Then, uh, in that case... I am good.
",2
2969,SpongeBob,31," Really?
",2
2970,Man Ray,31," Yes, really.
",2
2971,SpongeBob,31," Really, really?

",2
2973,SpongeBob,31," Really, really, really?
",2
2974,Man Ray,31," Yes, yes, already! I'm good! I'm good! Now let me out of here or you'll suffer dire consequences.

2975,SpongeBob,31," Well, that's good enough for me. [SpongeBob pulls the lever back to ""UNFREEZE"" Man Ray is unfrozen and falls to the ground]
",2
2976,Man Ray,31," You fools, prepare to be eradicated. [tries to jump at SpongeBob and Patrick but stops in mid-air and falls to the ground then laughs] What's wrong with me? Hahaha. What is this... Hahaha. infernal contraption?!
",2
2977,SpongeBob,31," Don't play dumb, Man Ray! You know that's the tickle belt Mermaid Man used on you in episode #17.

2978,Narrator,31," [showing a picture of the belt] As seen in episode 17!
",2
2979,Patrick,31," Oh, I love that episode.
",2
2980,SpongeBob,31," Oh, me too, me too.
",2
2981,Man Ray,31," I'll never get out of here wearing this belt. [chuckles] I... I need an evil plan that will trick them to take it off me. [chuckles again] Time for those acting lessons to pay off.
",2
2982,SpongeBob,31," Remember that part Mermaid Man and Barnacle...
",2
2983,Man Ray,31," Oh, sob! Oh, cry. [opens and closes his eyes] Oh, woe is me. You don't know what it's like being evil for so long. Oh, how I wish to be... good. If only some kind heroes would show me the path to decency. [SpongeBob and Patrick gasp]
",2
2984,SpongeBob,31," We could teach you how to be good and then we'll let you go.
",2
2985,Man Ray,31," [turns around] Ahh, that would be fantastic! [chuckles] I'll fake my way through this just like I did in high school.
",2
2986,SpongeBob,31," Okay, Man Ray. Are you ready first day at goodness school? [Man Ray puts an apple on his desk] Pat, get your wallet out. [Patrick gets his wallet out his pocket] Okay, goodness lesson number one. You see someone drop their wallet. Patrick, drop the wallet. [Patrick tosses it on the ground] Now, what do you do?
",2
2987,Man Ray,31," Excuse me, sir, but I do believe you've dropped your wallet.
",2
2988,Patrick,31," Doesn't look familiar to me.
",2
2989,Man Ray,31," What? I just saw you drop it. Here.
",2
2990,Patrick,31," Nope, it's not mine.
",2
2991,Man Ray,31," It is yours. I am trying to be a good person and return it to you.
",2
2992,Patrick,31," Return what to who?
",2
2993,Man Ray,31," [facepalms, then shows Patrick his ID] Aren't you Patrick Star?
",2
2994,Patrick,31," Yup.
",2
2995,Man Ray,31," And this is your ID.
",2
2996,Patrick,31," Yup.
",2
2997,Man Ray,31," I found this ID in this wallet. And if that's the case, this must be your wallet.
",2
2998,Patrick,31," That makes sense to me.
",2
2999,Man Ray,31," Then take it.
",2
3000,Patrick,31," It's not my wallet.
",2
3001,Man Ray,31," [in anger and frustration] You dim-bulb! Take back your wallet or I'll rip your arms off! [SpongeBob pushes tickle button and Man Ray laughs]
",2
3002,SpongeBob,31," Nuh. Wrong. [SpongeBob pushes button] Good people don't rip each others arms off! [Man Ray chuckles] Okay, goodness lesson number two. You see someone struggle with a heavy package. What do you do?
",2
3003,Man Ray,31," Hello, friend. I noticed you were struggling with that package. Would you like some help? [Patrick drops package on Man Ray's foot] Ow!
",2
3004,Patrick,31," Oops, sorry. Can I start over?
",2
3005,Man Ray,31," I noticed that... [Patrick drops package again] Ow!
",2
3006,Patrick,31," Oops. Gotta start again. [Patrick drops package again]
",2
3007,Man Ray,31," Could, Ow!
",2
3008,Patrick,31," Oops!
",2
3009,Man Ray,31," You butter-fingered pink thing! What's in that box anyhow?
",2
3010,Patrick,31," My wallets.
",2
3011,Man Ray,31," [in rage] Arghh! [Man Ray grabs Patrick head and slams him into the ground a lot]
",2
3012,Patrick,31," No! SpongeBob, tickle him! [SpongeBob pushes the tickle button but ManRay keeps slamming Patrick into the ground]
",2
3013,Man Ray,31," It tickles but it's worth it.
",2
3014,SpongeBob,31," Alright, goodness lesson number three. [Patrick is shown being severely damaged] Uhh, let's see. [Patrick grabs the remote]
",2
3015,Patrick,31," I've got one. I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100. What is it?
",2
3016,Man Ray,31," Umm... 62?
",2
3017,Patrick,31," Wrong! [pushes button]
",2
3018,Man Ray,31," Haha. Stop.
",2
3019,SpongeBob,31," Hey, Patrick, that's got nothing to do with being good.
",2
3020,Patrick,31," Let go of it, SpongeBob.
",2
3021,SpongeBob,31," Pat, we've got to use it only when he's bad.
",2
3022,Patrick,31," Let go!
",2
3023,SpongeBob,31," No, you let go!
",2
3024,SpongeBob and Patrick,31," Let go! [remote breaks and the belt goes hay-wire]
",2
3025,Man Ray,31," Frequency rising. Bel- Belt out of control. Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Belt on too hard. [he continues to laugh] It's tickling my DNA. Make it stop! [tears come out as he laughs] Haha. Please!
",2
3026,SpongeBob,31," Did you hear that, Patrick? He said the P word.
",2
3027,Patrick,31," Peanuts?
",2
3028,SpongeBob,31," No. Please.
",2
3029,Patrick,31," Well, that's good enough for me. I guess he's reconstituted.
",2
3030,SpongeBob,31," Rehabilitated.
",2
3031,Patrick,31," Gesundheit.
",2
3032,SpongeBob,31," It's graduation day, Man Ray. This is the key to your future. [unlocks the belt, then the tickling stops] Just look at him, Patrick. The picture of goodness. [Man Ray takes the Aqua-Glove off the wall of weapons] Umm, we're not supposed to touch that stuff. [Man Ray put the glove on his hand and activates it] We're not supposed to touch it that way, either. [Man Ray grabs the Cosmic-Ray and attaches it on the Aqua-Glove] We are really not suppose to touch those, sir. [He aims the weapon at SpongeBob and Patrick] good people have no use for weapons such as... [Man Ray zaps them into dust] Thoooose!
",2
3033,Man Ray,31," [laughs] The only thing I'm good at is being evil. [door opens and Man Ray runs] So long, suckers.
",2
3034,Patrick,31," What's that smell, SpongeBob?
",2
3035,SpongeBob,31," That, Patrick, is the smell of defeat.
",2
3036,Patrick,31," Good, I thought it was my skin.
",2
3037,SpongeBob,31," Forget about your skin, Patrick. Man Ray is still bad and someone has to stop him. This is a job for Mermaid Man...
",2
3038,Patrick,31," ...and Barnacle Boy! [both slide down pole and get their costumes on]
",2
3039,SpongeBob,31," To the Invisible Boat Mobile. [both stop in the invisible boat]
",2
3040,Patrick,31," Ignition, on!
",2
3041,SpongeBob,31," Wait! I don't have a license.
",2
3042,Patrick,31," Well, this is an invisible boat, right? So, you need an invisible license. [shapes hand into a rectangle]
",2
3043,SpongeBob,31," You're the best sidekick ever, Barnacle boy. [boats drives through the wall and into a street light]
",2
3044,Patrick,31," Thank goodness for invisible seat belts.
",2
3045,Man Ray,31," Out of my way, fools. You no longer have control of me. And now this town belongs to, ManRay!
",2
3046,SpongeBob,31," Not so fast, arch-villain. We still have the orb of confusion. [Patrick takes out the Orb of Confusion] Take this! [turns it on and gets all confused] Doy. Duh.
",2
3047,Man Ray,31," Well, that was easy. [heads to the bank where he kicks in the door] Hahaha. All right, people! Everybody stand right where you are.
",2
3048,Man Ray,31," I want you to, uh... [Man Ray chuckles, so everyone else chuckles, too] No! No! Stop giggling or I'll have to... [chuckles again, so everyone else is still chuckling] Stop laughing, you fools.
",2
3049,Bank Lady,31," What can I do for you, sir?
",2
3050,Man Ray,31," Well, I'll tell you what you can do. [points glove at the lady] Gimme all of your... [Man Ray chuckles again] G-gimme, gimme all of your... [Man Ray is still chuckling] Give me... [he chuckles so much he realizes what's going on] Ahh! The belt is gone but I still feel it's tickle. The urge to do bad is gone. [groans] I guess I'll just open a checking account. [Man Ray returns to Sponge Bob and Patrick and turns the orb of confusion off]
",2
3051,SpongeBob,31," Doy. [gasps] Man-Ray!
",2
3052,Man Ray,31," No need to be alarmed, SpongeBob. Your teachings have transformed me. Besides, I have checks... with little poodles on them! [Man Ray takes his head off and gives it to SpongeBob] I won't be needing this anymore. Farewell, fellow do-gooder. [walks off] 
",2
3053,SpongeBob,31," Bye, Man Ray! Wow. We did it! Just like the real Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. We saved the day. Isn't it incredible, Patrick! Patrick?
",2
3054,Patrick,31," Uhh... [still has a confused look on his face]
",2
3055,SpongeBob,31," Patrick, you know that thing's turned off, right? Patrick? Yoo-hoo? Patrick?!",2

3081,SpongeBob,32," Ahh! [begins to climb the mountain] Hey, no fair, Sandy! You got a head start!
",2
3082,Sandy,32," Sorry, SpongeBob, that's the way the coral crumbles! [collapses the rock SpongeBob is climbing on]
",2
3083,SpongeBob,32," Hey! [gets back on another rock] You did that on purpose!
",2
3084,Sandy,32," Yeah, but this is an accident! [unleashes more rocks at him]
",2
3085,SpongeBob,32," [screams] Aaaaah!
",2
3086,Sandy,32," Too bad you forgot your umbrella!
",2
3087,SpongeBob,32," [holds on to an umbrella and floats up] I didn't! [laughing, reaches the top of the cliff]
",2
3088,Sandy,32," [sitting in a lounge chair, reading a newspaper] Well. It's about time you showed up.
",2
3089,SpongeBob,32," [gibberish] I want a rematch! First one to the Krusty Krab is the winner!
",2
3090,Sandy,32," Ain't no way a sea critter can run faster than a land critter.
",2
3091,SpongeBob,32," I can underwater! I'm... [Low voice] Hydrodynamically designed! [Normal voice] Think you can win a fair race in that clunky tin tube?
",2
3092,Sandy,32," Why don't use ask my behind! That is, if you can catch it! What do you think of that, HydroPants?
",2
3093,SpongeBob,32," I'd say I'm already halfway there!-halfway there! [zooms out to reveal a record player] -halfway there!-halfway there!.
",2
3094,Sandy,32," [gasps] Hey!
",2
3095,SpongeBob,32," [running at the bottom of the mountain, laughing, hits a brick wall]
",2
3096,Sandy,32," [jumps on SpongeBob's face and over the brick wall] Thanks for the face lift! [runs into the Krusty Krab, laughing] You see, I told you that you didn't-
",2
3097,SpongeBob,32," [dressed as an old man] There you are! Ain't that just like a land creature to keep a sea creature [licks lips] waiting! [rips off suit, laughing]
",2
3098,Sandy,32," I thought y'all wanted a rematch.
",2
3099,SpongeBob,32," I did! And I took a head start like you did!
",2
3100,Sandy,32," Well, I was just funning with you that time! But I guess all y'all underwater don't have to play fair!
",2
3101,SpongeBob,32," I guess I don't, air breather!
",2
3102,Sandy,32," Water sucker!
",2
3103,SpongeBob,32," Tree climber!
",2
3104,Sandy,32," Gulf streamer!
",2
3105,SpongeBob,32," Kite flier!
",2
3106,Sandy,32," Chum chewer!
",2
3107,SpongeBob,32," [gasps] Take that back! You- [nervously] not wet person!
",2
3108,Sandy,32," Aha! You can't even come up with another name! That proves it!
",2
3109,SpongeBob,32," Proves what?
",2
3110,Sandy,32," That land critters are better than sea critters!
",2
3111,Patrick,32," [walks to the two] Better at what?
",2
3112,Sandy Cheeks,32," Oh, dern near everything, I guess. Cattle roping and pie eating and wood chopping and flying!
",2
3113,Squidward,32," [walks to the three] What's she blabbering about?
",2
3114,Patrick,32," She says land creatures are best.
",2
3115,Sandy,32," Only 'cause it's true! We're best at horse riding and fur stylin' and rowing. Y'all got us licked in swimming, but we've got corn shucking [Mr. Krabs joins the four] and hay bailing and barn raising... and fishing!
",2
3116,Sandy,32," And name calling, for sure!
",2
3117,Squidward,32," And drowning, don't forget drowning!
",2
3118,SpongeBob,32," [laughing] Good one, Squidward! [jumps to high five Squidward, but freezes in midair] Woo!
",2
3119,Squidward,32," Not on your life, sport. [SpongeBob falls]
",2
3120,SpongeBob,32," I'll admit, you've got some pretty good moves. For a squirrel. [SpongeBob and the rest except Sandy start laughing until SpongeBob signals them to stop] But you're still just a land creature.
",2
3121,Sandy,32," Squirrels can do anything they want to!
",2
3122,Patrick,32," I bet they can't eat a Krabby Double Deluxe in one bite. [gulps a big patty down] Ah.
",2
3123,Sandy,32," [reaches offscreen for the same big patty] Give me that. They don't call me Cheeks for nothing. [tries to eat it, but it splatters on her air helmet. Everyone, but Sandy, begins to laugh]
",2
3124,Patrick,32," Thank you, thank you.
",2
3125,Sandy,32," Well, there's just one thing.
",2
3126,Mr. Krabs,32," Can you do this? [pops his eyestalks in and out of his head] Everyone in my family can do that.
",2
3127,Sandy,32," [Tries to do it] Uh...uh...
",2
3128,Squidward,32," How about this? [balances six spinning plates on a stick with his tentacles] Huh?
",2
3129,SpongeBob,32," Can you reproduce by budding. [begins to do it] Can ya? Can ya? Can ya? Can ya?
",2
3130,Sandy,32," No!
",2
3131,SpongeBob,32," Most importantly...can you do this? [all except Sandy make their eyes big and round, and begin gasping three times without releasing any breath]
",2
3132,Sandy,32," Well, what would I wanna do any of that dumb stuff for anyway?
",2
3133,SpongeBob,32," Admit it, Sandy, you can't do anything us sea creatures can do. In fact, if wasn't for that suit, you couldn't live down here! [everyone but Sandy starts laughing]
",2
3134,Sandy,32," Well, you know... [all continue laughing] I don't need to... [all laughing harder] Grr... I'll show ya all! I don't need this suit! [rips off suit, and all gasp] And I don't need this helmet neither! [throws helmet to ground, releasing an air bubble]
",2
3135,Mr. Krabs,32," Neptune preserve her!
",2
3136,Squidward,32," How long can she stay like that?
",2
3137,SpongeBob,32," I don't know!
",2
3138,Patrick,32," Sandy's a girl?
",2
3139,SpongeBob,32," Wow, Sandy. You sure proved us wrong. I guess land creatures are better. At least until they need to breathe... [Sandy winks] Yep, won't be long now. [she starts struggling to hold her breath] Feelin' light-headed yet?
",2
3140,Sandy,32," Mm-mm. [Sandy shakes her head]
",2
3141,SpongeBob,32," Remember this? [SpongeBob takes a deep breath in and out]
",2
3142,Mr. Krabs,32," It's free! [also takes a deep breath in and out]
",2
3143,Sandy,32," [Starts suffocating underwater, screen cuts to her insides and her right lung breaks and falls off, she looks around and quickly searches through multiple objects, then puts her head into a pickle jar and breathes heavily. All others start laughing] Stop laughing at me!
",2
3144,Mr. Krabs,32," I knew it! There was no way some ""airhead"" was gonna win anything against a water breather!
",2
3145,Patrick,32," Airhead... [laughs. The top of his head deflates like a balloon] Huh? [puts thumb in mouth and blows. His head becomes round at the top]
",2
3146,"SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward and Mr. Krabs",32," Sea creatures rule! Water! Water! Water!
",2
3147,Sandy,32," All right, all right! You had your little laugh. But now it's my turn! Y'all think you're such hot stuff, don't ya! Swimming around with your fancy gills and such. But none of you wetheads could last a minute on my turf. Dry land!
",2
3148,Squidward,32," Do we have to wear pickle jars? [all, except Sandy, laugh]
",2
3149,Sandy,32," Nope, nothing but the clothes on your backs.
",2
3150,SpongeBob,32," One minute? No problem, Landy! [all but Sandy begin to laugh]
",2
3151,Sandy,32," [all but her are still laughing, as she leads them all to an island rising out of the water from the seafloor, as they see the island, they stop laughing] Well? So are you going or not?
",2
3152,SpongeBob,32," Actually, you know, but...
",2
3153,Squidward,32," We can't, uh...because...
",2
3154,Mr. Krabs,32," Well, um... we're late for our...
",2
3155,Patrick,32," Our fitting!
",2
3156,Sandy,32," Oh, you mean for your chicken costumes!
",2
3157,Patrick,32," [holding and eating popcorn] Hey! We are not chicken! [drops popcorn] Huh! My popcorn! [begins pecking at it like a chicken]
",2
3158,SpongeBob,32," Yeah, we're not chicken, we'll do it. [looks at the water's surface and pokes his finger above the water] There. Mission accomplished.
",2
3159,Sandy,32," Look. Unless you can stay above water for one measly minute, you forfeit the contest and prove that land creatures are better than sea creatures!
",2
3160,SpongeBob,32," No, way, San-day. We can take on your challenge!
",2
3161,"Patrick, Squidward and Mr. Krabs",32," Yeah!
",2
3162,SpongeBob,32," Where not afraid of your dumb old land!
",2
3163,"Patrick, Squidward and Mr. Krabs",32," Yeah!
",2
3164,SpongeBob,32," We're sea creatures!
",2
3165,"SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward and Mr. Krabs",32," Yeah!
",2
3166,SpongeBob,32," Okay... Well, this is it.
",2
3167,Mr. Krabs,32," Wait, boy! [gives him a glass of water] Make it last.
",2
3168,SpongeBob,32," [drinks from it] Thanks Mr. Krabs Ok! Here I go! [gasps out of water, He's now a real yellow kitchen sponge on a stick] Hey, this isn't so bad. We can do this! Hey, Patrick, come on up! The air is fine!
",2
3169,Patrick,32," I'm gonna do it quick and get it over with. Cannonball! [jumps up out of the water. He's now a real pink starfish, missing his pants, on a stick] Hey, I lost my trunks! Hi, SpongeBob!
",2
3170,SpongeBob,32," All right, Pat, you made it! Come on, Mr. Krabs! Up here!
",2
3171,Mr. Krabs,32," All ashore, that's going to shore, Mr. Squidward! Land ho! [runs up. he is a red rubber toy crab on a stick]
",2
3172,SpongeBob,32," Looking good, Mr. Krabs!
",2
3173,Patrick,32," Yeah! Yeah! Woohoo!
",2
3174,SpongeBob,32," Come on, Squidward, you're missing all the dry. Come on, Squidward!
",2
3175,"SpongeBob, Patrick and Mr. Krabs",32," [chanting] Squidward! Squidward! Squidward! Squidward!
",2
3176,Squidward,32," Well, I'll do it. But I won't like it. [walks up. he's a puppet squid with his eyes and big nose. [all stop chanting] ...What?
",2
3177,SpongeBob,32," Well, here we are. [all four are walking on the island]
",2
3178,Squidward,32," This is pretty easy.
",2
3179,Patrick,32," I may keep a second rock up here.
",2
3180,Mr. Krabs,32," Once you get your land legs it's not so bad!
",2
3181,SpongeBob,32," We're the masters of land and sea!
",2
3182,SpongeBob,32," [a string puppet seagull lands in front of them] Hey, a local. Hi, we're from underwater. Do you know Sandy Cheeks? [seagull looks at screen]
",2
3183,Sandy,32," 3, 2, 1. Well, tan my fur. They made it! Better congratulate them. [walks onto the island. She's now a real plush squirrel toy with a small, round plastic helmet on her head] SpongeBob! Patrick? Hmm, where'd those critters get to? [sees the seagulls attacking all four of them] Holy guacamole! You can't eat my friends, you rats with wings! Hiyah! [attacks the birds and feathers start flying. All five sink back down to the seabed, with Squidward upside-down.]
",2
3184,SpongeBob,32," Uh, thanks for saving us, Sandy.
",2
3185,Sandy,32," You know, everyone's best at something.
",2
3186,SpongeBob,32," But no one's best at everything. Sorry I made you take off your helmet, Sandy.
",2
3187,Sandy,32," Sorry I made you go up on dry land, SpongeBob.
",2
3188,Mr. Krabs,32," Three cheers for feeling sorry for ourselves! Hip hip!
",2
3189,All,32," Hooray!
",2
3190,Mr. Krabs,32," Hip hip!

",2
3201,Pirates,33," Hooray!
",2
3202,Narrator,33," And now the host of You Wish. He's got puffy and better loons then Captain Kidd, and fuzzier facial hair then Black Beard. He's America's favorite Pirate, Patchy of Encino.
",2
3203,Patchy,33," Ahoy, fellow fanatics! Welcome to me quarters. Why don't come on back on the galley, I'm cooking up a little treat for you today. It's call-in-and-vote time. You get to choose how our cartoon ends today, via the phone, or the Internet if your technologically inclined. Now this cartoon is different from most cartoons in that-
",2
3204,Potty,33," Bawk! In what way?
",2
3205,Patchy,33," Well, If it isn't my less-than-amusing sidekick, Potty the Parrot. Potty, say hello to the nice people.
",2
3206,Potty,33," Help! I'm being held here against my will-- Help!
",2
3207,Patchy,33," Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh... Oh, Potty come back! Potty? Potty? Were'd you go? Potty, you in here, buddy?
",2
3208,Potty,33," [laughs and squawking] Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha.
",2
3209,Patchy,33," Get me out of here, you scurvy bird! [The cannon blasts Patchy out and Patchy screams; he lands in a neighboring house which sinks like a boat. Patchy returns, still smoking from the cannon blast] Now, what was I saying? Now this cartoon ain't like most of your ""land-lobbing cartoons"". This cartoon has not one, not two, but three different endings! So, when I tell you to call the number their that's scrolling at the bottom of the screen... [""1-800-624-4094 or go to Nick.com"" appears on the bottom of the screen (in the First 100 Episodes version it says ""Yikes matey! Original 800 number as aired has been retired to Davy Jones locker!"" instead). Phone starts ringing. Patchy picks up phone] No, not now! Don't call 'till I tell you to! Roll the cartoon! Now, remember to vote at the end because- [More phones start to ring] Your not gonna make this easy are ya. Quiet! Vast their! Be laze that ringing! Stop! Its driving me mad!

3210,SpongeBob,33," [eating Kelp-O cereal] Mmm, Kelp-O! With one of eight essential prizes inside! [checks in the cereal box but then a giant anchor comes crashing through SpongeBob's house] Holy shrimp! [runs out to Squidward] Squidward! The sky had a baby from my cereal box! Squidward! [Squidward pokes his head through his window] Squidward! The sky had a baby!
",2
3211,Squidward,33," That's not a baby! That's a giant anchor! Now go away! [Patrick comes over]
",2
3212,Patrick,33," Hey, SpongeBob! The sky had a baby!
",2
3213,SpongeBob,33," I know! What do you think we should name it?
",2
3214,Patrick,33," How about...
",2
3215,Squidward,33," Why don't you two go climb its anchor rope? I'm sure it goes somewhere far away! [Anchor crashes into Squidward's house] Now look what you've done!
",2
3216,SpongeBob,33," We didn't do it, Squidward. Our hands are clean! [SpongeBob and Patrick show their spotless hands]
",2
3217,Patrick,33," Clean...
",2
3218,Squidward,33," [on top of his house] Well, I'm gonna get to the bottom of this thing.
",2
3219,SpongeBob,33," Wouldn't that be the top? [Squidward starts to climb rope]
",2
3220,SpongeBob,33," Squid, wait! Wait!
",2

",2
3224,Patrick,33," SpongeBob, how long are you gonna stay in your little fantasy world?
",2
3225,SpongeBob,33," No, look, a giant ship!
",2
3226,Squidward,33," Great! Let's go! Now I can finally give this anchor-dropper a piece of my mind.
",2
3227,SpongeBob,33," I don't know, Squidward. That ship has a spooky green glow around it.
",2
3228,Squidward,33," That's probably because its good-for-nothing owner is too lazy to clean or drop its anchors in the right place.
",2
3229,SpongeBob,33," Squid, wait! [all 3 reach the top]
",2
3230,Squidward,33," All right, who owns this crate? [notices a door that says ""owner"" and begins to knock on it] Come on out! I wanna file a complaint! [SpongeBob looks around the ship]
",2
3231,SpongeBob,33," Doesn't this place seem familiar?
",2
3232,Patrick,33," I don't know. Why?
",2
3233,SpongeBob,33," I don't know. Doesn't it just kind of ring a bell? [Squidward rings the doorbell]
",2
3234,Patrick,33," Yes!
",2
3235,SpongeBob,33," I know who owns this boat but I just can't place the name. [SpongeBob walks by a barrel that says ""property of the Flying Dutchman""]
",2
3236,Flying Dutchman,33," Rawr!!
",2
3237,SpongeBob,33," No, no, it's not ""rawr!""
",2
3238,Flying Dutchman,33," I am the Flying Dutchman!
",2
3239,SpongeBob,33," That's it! Squidward, this ship belongs to the Red Baron!
",2
3240,Flying Dutchman,33," Who be disturbin' the Flying Dutchman in his own lair?
",2
3241,SpongeBob,33," It's Squidward. He wants to complain to you. [Flying Dutchman gives an evil look to Squidward]
",2
3242,Squidward,33," I...no, I don't.
",2
3243,SpongeBob,33," Well, what about all that stuff about him having a dirty ship and being lazy and all? [Flying Dutchman glares angrily at Squidward]
",2
3244,Squidward,33," [laughs nervously] I never said that.
",2
3245,Flying Dutchman,33," Insultin' a man's ship be worse than insultin' his mother!
",2
3246,SpongeBob,33," No, no, wait, it was his mother you said was dirty, not his ship. [shoots fire out his nose frying up Squidward]
",2
3247,Squidward,33," [screams] Ow.
",2
3248,Flying Dutchman,33," [looks over to SpongeBob and Patrick] You're next!
",2
3249,SpongeBob and Patrick,33," [jumps off the ship] That was a close one! [land back on the ship]
",2
3250,Flying Dutchman,33," Welcome back!
",2
3251,SpongeBob,33," [he and Patrick scream and jump off the ship] That was a closer one! [land back on the ship]
",2
3252,Flying Dutchman,33," Welcome back! [SpongeBob and Patrick jump off the ship]
",2
3253,Squidward,33," Hey! How come when they act up, all they get is the welcome wagon? If you ask me, it's... [Flying Dutchman zaps Squidward while SpongeBob and Patrick land back on the ship]
",2
3254,Flying Dutchman,33," So, are you gonna try that again?
",2
3255,Patrick,33," Probably. [Flying Dutchman zaps Squidward]
",2
3256,Flying Dutchman,33," How 'bout now?
",2
3257,Patrick,33," Uhh...
",2
3258,Squidward,33," [covers Patrick's mouth with tentacle] No, no, they're not. Whew. [Flying Dutchman zaps Squidward]
",2
3259,Flying Dutchman,33," Now listen. [takes out a ""Ghost Rule Book""] Whosoever sets foot on the Flying Dutchman's ship, uninvited or otherwise, shall become members of his ghostly crew forever! [closes rule book] And, uhh [opens rule book], ever. [closes rule book]
",2
3260,Squidward,33," Will we be getting business cards?
",2
3261,Flying Dutchman,33," [zaps Squidward] Silence! You're part of my crew now, and our job is to sail around and frighten people. It'll be grueling, mind- numbing, and repetitive. Just like...daytime television.
",2
3262,Squidward,33," Now you listen here, mister. If you think I'm gonna spend more than five minutes on this dumpster, then you're crazy. I mean, look at this place. It's disgusting! [shows a green jockstrap] Whoever told you that having oil lamps next to hardwood paneling was a good idea... [Dutchman picks up Squidward] Oh, oh, now what? I suppose you're gonna show me... [Flying Dutchman unzips something in mid-air] Oh, gee, that's very nice. What is this, some kind of magic act? [Flying Dutchman tosses Squidward into the Fly of Despair. Squidward screams as he falls inside the Fly of Despair. SpongeBob and Patrick look at Squidward in a blank worried face.]
",2
3263,Flying Dutchman,33," [closes Fly of Despair] Would anyone else like to enter the ""Fly of Despair""?
",2
3264,SpongeBob,33," No! We know our place now, Mister Dutchman.
",2
3265,Patrick,33," We'll do anything you say!
",2
3266,Flying Dutchman,33," Then, for starters, you can...swab the deck! [hands them a mop and a bucket]
",2
3267,SpongeBob,33," Look, Patrick! A real, live, ghost mop!
",2
3268,Patrick,33," And I got this hat!
",2
3269,Flying Dutchman,33," Listen! We're heading down to Bikini Bottom tonight for a little haunting spree, so I want this ship to look good and scary!
",2
3270,SpongeBob,33," You mean you want it to look good...and scary. Well, I think we can probably...
",2
3271,Patrick,33," No, no, I think he means he wants it to look so good that it's scary.
",2
3272,SpongeBob,33," Or maybe that by looking so scary you forget that it doesn't look good!
",2
3273,Patrick,33," I don't get it.
",2
3274,SpongeBob,33," Look, it's easy, it simply means that...
",2
3275,Flying Dutchman,33," Never mind what it means! I just want it to look scary! That's it! You know, mold growing on the ceilings and bugs in the sink.
",2
3276,SpongeBob,33," So, you don't want it to look good?
",2
3277,Flying Dutchman,33," Get moving! [SpongeBob and Patrick start mopping]
",2
3278,SpongeBob and Patrick,33," [singing, while sweeping with the mop and bucket] A sailor's life is a wonderful life / A wonderful life for sure!
",2
3279,Flying Dutchman,33," What a night be this! Crew, howl with me so that we might set the Seven Seas ablaze with fear! [howls like a wolf]
",2
3280,SpongeBob,33," [screams]
",2
3281,Patrick,33," Leedle-leedle-leedle-lee!
",2
3282,Flying Dutchman,33," [howls like a wolf]
",2
3283,SpongeBob,33," [screams]
",2
3284,Patrick,33," Leedle-leedle-leedle-lee! [Flying Dutchman going to howl again but Patrick cuts him off] Leedle-eedle-eedle- eedle-eedle! [Flying Dutchman going to howl again but Patrick cuts him off] Leedle-eedle-eedle-eedle-eedle! [Flying Dutchman going to howl again but Patrick cuts him off] Leedle-eedle-eedle-eedle-eedle!
",2
3285,Flying Dutchman,33," Eh, that'll do. Okay, Square One, since Pink One's working the navigation, it's up to you to find our first victim. Here, use this spyglass. Now hurry up! We're burnin' moonlight!

3286,SpongeBob,33," Let's see who we can find. [spins telescope on ground] Captain, there's a guy we can scare. [telescope points to a big tough guy then Flying Dutchman blows on the telescope spinning it a little to land on a little kid]
",2
3287,Billy,33," I had four biscuits, and I ate one. Then I only had three.
",2
3288,Flying Dutchman,33," Ahh, it does me heart good to see children out after dark. Pink One, take us behind those rocks.
",2
3289,Patrick,33," Moving behind the rocks! [ship moves scratches and tears up through the rocky parts of the sea]
",2
3290,SpongeBob,33," Keep going. You're good. You're good. You're good...and...stop. Don't worry, Captain, we'll buff out those scratches.
",2
3291,Flying Dutchman,33," All right, never mind it. Just jump out when I give the signal. [Flying Dutchman scares Billy from behind a rock]
",2
3292,Flying Dutchman,33," Boo! Prepare to be burdened with the haunting memory of my ghostly ghost pirates! [points to SpongeBob and Patrick who just get confuse]
",2
3293,SpongeBob,33," Was that the signal? Okay, sorry, sorry, just...just do it again.
",2
3294,Flying Dutchman,33," With the haunting memory of my ghostly ghost pirates! [SpongeBob and Patrick come out and SpongeBob does a little trick with his fingers]
",2
3295,Patrick,33," How does he do that?
",2
3296,Flying Dutchman,33," Get back on the ship.
",2
3297,SpongeBob and Patrick,33," It's still a mystery!
",2
3298,Billy,33," Those guys are dorks.
",2
3299,Flying Dutchman,33," Yes, but they're my dorks. [goes back to showing SpongeBob and Patrick steering through the rocks tearing up the ship]
",2
3300,SpongeBob,33," You're good. You're good. You're good. [Flying Dutchman goes through Bikini Bottom terrorizing citizens while SpongeBob and Patrick do stupid tricks. Later shown the ship is still getting wrecked] You're good. You're good. You're good. [Flying Dutchman goes through Bikini Bottom terrorizing citizens while SpongeBob and Patrick do stupid tricks. Later shown the ship is still getting wrecked] You're good.. You're good. You're good. [Flying Dutchman scares another citizen while SpongeBob and Patrick figure- skate in purple tights. back on the ship] Why do you think the Dutchman asked us to wait in our bunk room?
",2
3301,Patrick,33," Maybe he's gonna give us a reward!
",2
3302,SpongeBob,33," Like movie passes?
",2
3303,Patrick,33," Or an oversized coffee mug?! [both start bouncing insanely]
",2
3304,Flying Dutchman,33," I've been thinking. Stop bouncing! [both stop] This whole crew for eternity thing isn't working out. It's not really you so much as it is me.
",2
3305,SpongeBob,33," You're setting us free?
",2
3306,Flying Dutchman,33," Well, actually, I'm just gonna eat you. See you at dinner! [SpongeBob and Patrick scream]
",2
3307,Patrick,33," Wait, I have an idea!
",2
3308,SpongeBob,33," Really?! What is it?
",2
3309,Patrick,33," Let's leave!
",2
3310,SpongeBob,33," But the door is locked and the only way out is through the...perfume department. [points to a room full of perfume and customers]
",2
3311,Patrick,33," Let's do it. [they try to run through the department but get sprayed with all sorts of perfume]
",2
3312,SpongeBob,33," I always hate going in there!
",2
3313,Patrick,33," Yeah.
",2
3314,SpongeBob,33," [hears something strange] Wait! Listen! [Flying Dutchman is in his room]
",2
3315,SpongeBob,33," Never!
",2
3316,Flying Dutchman,33," Ok, then... [tries to zap SpongeBob but SpongeBob holds up the sock as protection] Give it to me!
",2
3317,SpongeBob,33," No! [Sock begins to tear]
",2
3318,Flying Dutchman,33," Wait, you're stretching out the elastic!
",2
3319,Patrick,33," It would seem we have reached an impasse.
",2
3320,Flying Dutchman,33," Pink one is right. Tell you what. You give me back the sock, and I'll give you...three wishes.
",2
3321,Patrick,33," Make it five.
",2
3322,Flying Dutchman,33," Four.
",2
3323,Patrick,33," Three. Take it or leave it.
",2
3324,Flying Dutchman,33," Ok...uhh, three. You get three wishes.
",2
3325,SpongeBob,33," Wow! Three wishes, Pat. Isn't that great?
",2
3326,Patrick,33," Wishes? I wish we had known that earlier! [clock goes backwards one minute]
",2
3327,Flying Dutchman,33," Okay, you got two wishes left. [Patrick smiles with embarrassment at an angry SpongeBob]
",2
3328,SpongeBob,33," Well, we still have two more. How exciting! I wish Squidward were here to see this! [falls through a hole in the Fly Of Despair and crashes onto his bed]
",2
3329,Squidward,33," Boy, I'm glad all that's over! [re-appears on the ship]
",2
3330,SpongeBob and Patrick,33," Squidward! You're back!
",2
3331,SpongeBob,33," Guess what? The Dutchman gave us three wishes! Patrick used the first one, and I guess I... [realizing] just used the second one.
",2
3332,Squidward,33," Well, then, the last one you owe me because you got me back into this mess!
",2
3333,Patrick,33," Wait! I think it belongs to me! [everyone starts to argue] Because I didn't really get a real wish, so why should you get a wish...
",2
3334,SpongeBob,33," Well, that's not right because... [their arguing devolves into incoherent yelling, babbling and shouting]
",2
3335,Flying Dutchman,33," That's enough! Using my mystic other-worldly powers, I shall decide who gets the last wish. [uses the eeny- meenie-minie-mo method] Eeny, meeny, miny, mo, catch a sailor by the toe, if he hollers, let him go, my mother told me to pick the very best one and...
",2
3336,Voting Guy,33," All hands! All hands! Its time to vote! Its voting time!
",2
3337,Flying Dutchman,33," [finishing eenie-meenie-minie-mo] You are it! [Stops on Patrick.]
",2
3338,SpongeBob,33," That's you, Patrick. Make your wish.
",2
3339,Patrick,33," Uhh...
",2
3340,Squidward,33," Wait, Patrick, listen. I do not particularly feel like being trapped here for all eternity. Eternity is a very long time, understand?!
",2
3341,SpongeBob,33," Patrick, you've got to think harder than you've ever thought before.
",2
3342,Patrick,33," Uhh...
",2
3343,SpongeBob,33," That's not gonna do it! Think harder!
",2
3344,Patrick,33," Uhh...
",2
3345,Squidward and SpongeBob,33," Come on! Come on, Patrick! Yeah! Put on your thinking cap!
",2
3346,Patrick,33," Uhh... [Inside Patrick's eye is a toaster that brings up some toast.] Okay! I've got it.
",2
3347,Flying Dutchman,33," Thou wish is granted.
",2
3348,Patrick,33," [Chewing on gum.] Oh, I'm sorry. Want some gum? [SpongeBob and Squidward are shocked.]
",2
3349,Squidward,33," You wished for gum?
",2
3350,Patrick,33," Well, if we're gonna be here forever, we might as well have fresh breath!
",2
3351,SpongeBob,33," Come on, mister, let us out! Don't be so mean! Don't be so fatty!
",2
3352,Patrick,33," Aaaah! Let us out!
",2
3353,Flying Dutchman,33," Ahh, minty.
",2
3354,Patchy,33," Heh heh heh. That Patrick shivers me timbers right down to my peg leg! Ha! ha! ha! You were right not to pick that one kids! Seemed like a lot of nonsense to me! Molarchy! Oh well, let's take a look at the other loser! Heh heh heh! [An image of Squidward is shown, with a skull in front of him.] It appears you didn't vote for Squidward. I don't blame you, I wouldn't have either! But, let's see what would happen if the Old Dutchman's Eeny-Minie-Mo finger landed on Squidward!
",2
3355,Flying Dutchman,33," [finishing eenie-meenie-minie-mo] You are it! [Stops on Squidward]
",2
3356,SpongeBob,33," Squidward, you get a wish! A great big wish!
",2
3357,Squidward,33," That's right! And you know what I wish?
",2
3358,Patrick,33," No!
",2
3359,Squidward,33," I wish that I had never met you two barnacle-heads before in my entire life!
",2
3360,Flying Dutchman,33," So be it.
",2
3361,SpongeBob,33," Hi there, I don't believe we've met. My name is SpongeBob, and this is my associate Patrick.
",2
3362,Patrick,33," Hi.
",2
3363,Squidward,33," That's not what I meant!
",2
3364,Flying Dutchman,33," Well, now that introductions are out of the way, it's time for dinner [Flying Dutchman appears with a big belly]
",2
3365,SpongeBob,33," And what did you say your name was?
",2
3366,Squidward,33," I'm Squidward. I'm your neighbor.
",2
3367,SpongeBob,33," Oh, nice to meet you, Squid-ward. [Tries to pronounce it right] We'll have plenty of time to get to know each other, I guess. [Laughs.]
",2
3368,Patchy,33," And now, the moment you've all been waiting for, So get ready to blow milk out of your nose because its time to announce, the winner! The envelope please Potty. Thank you, my fine feathered assistant. Well what do you know? The winner is, SpongeBob! [A flag is shown with SpongeBob with the words ""Winner"" on the left side, Patchy blows his nose] Hey, Potty, do you smell something? Oh, Potty! That fuse in your head! I told you we're not doing that stunt!
",2
3369,Potty,33," Brawk, I didn't get the memo! Brawk! [Potty blows up along with Patchy; Patchy coughs up a feather and recovers from the blast]
",2
3370,Patchy,33," And now, the most requested ending! Hooray! [Potty collapses to the floor]
",2
3371,Flying Dutchman,33," [finishing eenie-meenie-minie-mo] You are it! [stops on SpongeBob]
",2
3372,Squidward,33," Now, think, SpongeBob! We're about to get eaten. What can you wish for to make it so we don't get eaten?
",2
3373,SpongeBob,33," Don't worry, Squidward. I've got it all figured out. He won't be able to eat us because...I wish the Dutchman was a vegetarian! [Flying Dutchman turns into a vegetarian and SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward re-appear in front of SpongeBob's house but you can only see their heads]
",2
3374,"SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward",33," Hooray!
",2
3375,SpongeBob,33," We're home!
",2
3376,Patrick,33," You did it, SpongeBob. We're saved!
",2
3377,Squidward,33," But why have we been turned into fruits? [their bodies have been turned into fruits and they are in a blender]
",2
3378,Flying Dutchman,33," Hey, I get a wish too. Fruit prevents scurvy! [SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward bounce away in the blender] Hey, get back here with that! [Flying Dutchman chases them around the ship, which is now a hippie-themed Volkswagen with a main mast.
",2
3379,Patchy,33," [Patchy is shown sitting at the counch crying] Hold on! Sorry about that kids! Its just that old Patchy can't help but get all choked up at the end of a show. But the good news is, when you watch this cartoon land-lobbing style like you usually do, it'll have the ending you picked, so now your an official big time cartoon decision maker! [Cuts to a bunch of monkeys at a zoo] Just don't let it go to your head! Well, say good night to the folks Potty! Potty!
",2
3380,Potty,33," Sqwuak! I quit! I quit!
",2
3381,Patchy,33," Ohhh! Oh, that's it folks! Right now I got a little employee management to take care of! Oh, Potty! Potty, get in your nice cage! Potty I'm not kidding!
",2
3382,Narrator,33," And so, we conclude SpongeBob's You Wish Spectacular Special! Thanks for voting!
",2
3383,Patchy,33," [Bite sound's heard] OW!
",2
3384,Patchy,33," Ahoy, fellow fanatics! Welcome to Patchy's Pick. Why don't come on back on the galley, I got a little treat for you today. We're gonna see me favorite show Shanghaied! Ta-da!
",2
3385,Potty,33," Boring!
",2
3386,Patchy,33," Well, If it isn't my less-than-amusing sidekick, Potty the Parrot. Potty, say hello to the nice people.
",2
3387,Potty,33," Bawk! I'm being held here against my will-- Help!
",2
3388,Patchy,33," Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh... Oh, Potty come back! Potty? Potty? Were'd you go? Potty, you in here, buddy?
",2
3389,Potty,33," [laughs and squawking] Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha.
",2
3390,Patchy,33," Get me out of here, you scurvy bird! [The cannon blasts Patchy out and Patchy screams; he lands in a neighboring house which sinks like a boat. Patchy returns, still smoking from the cannon blast] Well, roll the cartoon.
",2
3391,SpongeBob,33," [eating Kelp-O cereal] Mmm, Kelp-O! With one of eight essential prizes inside! [checks in the cereal box but then a giant anchor comes crashing through SpongeBob's house] Holy shrimp! [runs out to Squidward] Squidward! The sky had a baby from my cereal box! Squidward! [Squidward pokes his head through his window] Squidward! The sky had a baby!
",2
3392,Squidward,33," That's not a baby! That's a giant anchor! Now go away! [Patrick comes over]
",2
3393,Patrick,33," Hey, SpongeBob! The sky had a baby!
",2
3394,SpongeBob,33," I know! What do you think we should name it?
",2
3395,Patrick,33," How about...
",2
3396,Squidward,33," Why don't you two go climb its anchor rope? I'm sure it goes somewhere far away! [Anchor crashes into Squidward's house] Now look what you've done!
",2
3397,SpongeBob,33," We didn't do it, Squidward. Our hands are clean! [SpongeBob and Patrick show their spotless hands]
",2
3398,Patrick,33," Clean...
",2
3399,Squidward,33," [on top of his house] Well, I'm gonna get to the bottom of this thing.
",2
3400,SpongeBob,33," Wouldn't that be the top? [Squidward starts to climb rope]
",2
3401,SpongeBob,33," Squid, wait! Wait!
",2
3402,Patrick,33," Squidward! [SpongeBob and Patrick start climbing rope also]
",2
3403,Narrator,33," A few inches later...
",2
3404,SpongeBob,33," [points up] Ship!
",2
3405,Patrick,33," SpongeBob, how long are you gonna stay in your little fantasy world?
",2
3406,SpongeBob,33," No, look, a giant ship!
",2
3407,Squidward,33," Great! Let's go! Now I can finally give this anchor-dropper a piece of my mind.
",2
3408,SpongeBob,33," I don't know, Squidward. That ship has a spooky green glow around it.
",2
3409,Squidward,33," That's probably because its good-for-nothing owner is too lazy to clean or drop its anchors in the right place.
",2
3410,SpongeBob,33," Squid, wait! [all 3 reach the top]
",2
3411,Squidward,33," All right, who owns this crate? [notices a door that says ""owner"" and begins to knock on it] Come on out! I wanna file a complaint! [SpongeBob looks around the ship]
",2
3412,SpongeBob,33," Doesn't this place seem familiar?
",2
3413,Patrick,33," I don't know. Why?
",2
3414,SpongeBob,33," I don't know. Doesn't it just kind of ring a bell? [Squidward rings the doorbell]
",2
3415,Patrick,33," Yes!
",2
3416,SpongeBob,33," I know who owns this boat but I just can't place the name. [SpongeBob walks by a barrel that says ""property of the Flying Dutchman""]
",2
3417,Flying Dutchman,33," Rawr!!
",2
3418,SpongeBob,33," No, no, it's not ""rawr!""
",2
3419,Flying Dutchman,33," I am the Flying Dutchman!
",2
3420,SpongeBob,33," That's it! Squidward, this ship belongs to the Red Baron!
",2
3421,Flying Dutchman,33," Who be disturbin' the Flying Dutchman in his own lair?
",2
3422,SpongeBob,33," It's Squidward. He wants to complain to you. [Flying Dutchman gives an evil look to Squidward]
",2
3423,Squidward,33," I...no, I don't.
",2
3424,SpongeBob,33," Well, what about all that stuff about him having a dirty ship and being lazy and all? [Flying Dutchman glares angrily at Squidward]
",2
3425,Squidward,33," [laughs nervously] I never said that.
",2
3426,Flying Dutchman,33," Insultin' a man's ship be worse than insultin' his mother!
",2
3427,SpongeBob,33," No, no, wait, it was his mother you said was dirty, not his ship. [shoots fire out his nose frying up Squidward]
",2
3428,Squidward,33," [screams] Ow.
",2
3429,Flying Dutchman,33," [looks over to SpongeBob and Patrick] You're next!
",2
3430,SpongeBob and Patrick,33," [jumps off the ship] That was a close one! [land back on the ship]
",2
3431,Flying Dutchman,33," Welcome back!
",2
3432,SpongeBob,33," [he and Patrick scream and jump off the ship] That was a closer one! [land back on the ship]
",2
3433,Flying Dutchman,33," Welcome back! [SpongeBob and Patrick jump off the ship]
",2
3434,Squidward,33," Hey! How come when they act up, all they get is the welcome wagon? If you ask me, it's... [Flying Dutchman zaps Squidward while SpongeBob and Patrick land back on the ship]
",2
3435,Flying Dutchman,33," So, are you gonna try that again?
",2
3436,Patrick,33," Probably. [Flying Dutchman zaps Squidward]
",2
3437,Flying Dutchman,33," How 'bout now?
",2
3438,Patrick,33," Uhh...
",2
3439,Squidward,33," [covers Patrick's mouth with tentacle] No, no, they're not. Whew. [Flying Dutchman zaps Squidward]
",2
3440,Flying Dutchman,33," Now listen. [takes out a ""Ghost Rule Book""] Whosoever sets foot on the Flying Dutchman's ship, uninvited or otherwise, shall become members of his ghostly crew forever! [closes rule book] And, uhh [opens rule book], ever. [closes rule book]
",2
3441,Squidward,33," Will we be getting business cards?
",2
3442,Flying Dutchman,33," [zaps Squidward] Silence! You're part of my crew now, and our job is to sail around and frighten people. It'll be grueling, mind- numbing, and repetitive. Just like...daytime television.
",2
3443,Squidward,33," Now you listen here, mister. If you think I'm gonna spend more than five minutes on this dumpster, then you're crazy. I mean, look at this place. It's disgusting! [shows a green jockstrap] Whoever told you that having oil lamps next to hardwood paneling was a good idea... [Dutchman picks up Squidward] Oh, oh, now what? I suppose you're gonna show me... [Flying Dutchman unzips something in mid-air] Oh, gee, that's very nice. What is this, some kind of magic act? [Flying Dutchman tosses Squidward into the Fly of Despair. Squidward screams as he falls inside the Fly of Despair. SpongeBob and Patrick look at Squidward in a blank worried face.]
",2
3444,Flying Dutchman,33," [closes Fly of Despair] Would anyone else like to enter the ""Fly of Despair""?
",2
3445,SpongeBob,33," No! We know our place now, Mister Dutchman.
",2
3446,Patrick,33," We'll do anything you say!
",2
3447,Flying Dutchman,33," Then, for starters, you can...swab the deck! [hands them a mop and a bucket]
",2
3448,SpongeBob,33," Look, Patrick! A real, live, ghost mop!
",2
3449,Patrick,33," And I got this hat!
",2
3450,Flying Dutchman,33," Listen! We're heading down to Bikini Bottom tonight for a little haunting spree, so I want this ship to look good and scary!
",2
3451,SpongeBob,33," You mean you want it to look good...and scary. Well, I think we can probably...
",2
3452,Patrick,33," No, no, I think he means he wants it to look so good that it's scary.
",2
3453,SpongeBob,33," Or maybe that by looking so scary you forget that it doesn't look good!
",2
3454,Patrick,33," I don't get it.
",2
3455,SpongeBob,33," Look, it's easy, it simply means that...
",2
3456,Flying Dutchman,33," Never mind what it means! I just want it to look scary! That's it! You know, mold growing on the ceilings and bugs in the sink.
",2
3457,SpongeBob,33," So, you don't want it to look good?
",2
3458,Flying Dutchman,33," Get moving! [SpongeBob and Patrick start mopping]
",2
3459,SpongeBob and Patrick,33," [singing, while sweeping with the mop and bucket] A sailor's life is a wonderful life / A wonderful life for sure!
",2
3460,Flying Dutchman,33," What a night be this! Crew, howl with me so that we might set the Seven Seas ablaze with fear! [howls like a wolf]
",2
3461,SpongeBob,33," [screams]
",2
3462,Patrick,33," Leedle-leedle-leedle-lee!
",2
3463,Flying Dutchman,33," [howls like a wolf]
",2
3464,SpongeBob,33," [screams]
",2
3465,Patrick,33," Leedle-leedle-leedle-lee! [Flying Dutchman going to howl again but Patrick cuts him off] Leedle-eedle-eedle- eedle-eedle! [Flying Dutchman going to howl again but Patrick cuts him off] Leedle-eedle-eedle-eedle-eedle! [Flying Dutchman going to howl again but Patrick cuts him off] Leedle-eedle-eedle-eedle-eedle!
",2
3466,Flying Dutchman,33," Eh, that'll do. Okay, Square One, since Pink One's working the navigation, it's up to you to find our first victim. Here, use this spyglass. Now hurry up! We're burnin' moonlight!
",2
3467,SpongeBob,33," Let's see who we can find. [spins telescope on ground] Captain, there's a guy we can scare. [telescope points to a big tough guy then Flying Dutchman blows on the telescope spinning it a little to land on a little kid]
",2
3468,Billy,33," I had four biscuits, and I ate one. Then I only had three.
",2
3469,Flying Dutchman,33," Ahh, it does me heart good to see children out after dark. Pink One, take us behind those rocks.
",2
3470,Patrick,33," Moving behind the rocks! [ship moves scratches and tears up through the rocky parts of the sea]
",2
3471,SpongeBob,33," Keep going. You're good. You're good. You're good...and...stop. Don't worry, Captain, we'll buff out those scratches.
",2
3472,Flying Dutchman,33," All right, never mind it. Just jump out when I give the signal. [Flying Dutchman scares Billy from behind a rock]
",2
3473,Flying Dutchman,33," Boo! Prepare to be burdened with the haunting memory of my ghostly ghost pirates! [points to SpongeBob and Patrick who just get confuse]
",2
3474,SpongeBob,33," Was that the signal? Okay, sorry, sorry, just...just do it again.
",2
3475,Flying Dutchman,33," With the haunting memory of my ghostly ghost pirates! [SpongeBob and Patrick come out and SpongeBob does a little trick with his fingers]
",2
3476,Patrick,33," How does he do that?
",2
3477,Flying Dutchman,33," Get back on the ship.
",2
3478,SpongeBob and Patrick,33," It's still a mystery!
",2
3479,Billy,33," Those guys are dorks.
",2
3480,Flying Dutchman,33," Yes, but they're my dorks. [goes back to showing SpongeBob and Patrick steering through the rocks tearing up the ship]
",2
3481,SpongeBob,33," You're good. You're good. You're good. [Flying Dutchman goes through Bikini Bottom terrorizing citizens while SpongeBob and Patrick do stupid tricks. Later shown the ship is still getting wrecked] You're good. You're good. You're good. [Flying Dutchman goes through Bikini Bottom terrorizing citizens while SpongeBob and Patrick do stupid tricks. Later shown the ship is still getting wrecked] You're good.. You're good. You're good. [Flying Dutchman scares another citizen while SpongeBob and Patrick figure- skate in purple tights. back on the ship] Why do you think the Dutchman asked us to wait in our bunk room?
",2
3482,Patrick,33," Maybe he's gonna give us a reward!
",2
3483,SpongeBob,33," Like movie passes?
",2
3484,Patrick,33," Or an oversized coffee mug?! [both start bouncing insanely]
",2
3485,Flying Dutchman,33," I've been thinking. Stop bouncing! [both stop] This whole crew for eternity thing isn't working out. It's not really you so much as it is me.
",2
3486,SpongeBob,33," You're setting us free?
",2
3487,Flying Dutchman,33," Well, actually, I'm just gonna eat you. See you at dinner! [SpongeBob and Patrick scream]
",2
3488,Patrick,33," Wait, I have an idea!
",2
3489,SpongeBob,33," Really?! What is it?
",2
3490,Patrick,33," Let's leave!
",2
3491,SpongeBob,33," But the door is locked and the only way out is through the...perfume department. [points to a room full of perfume and customers]
",2
3492,Patrick,33," Let's do it. [they try to run through the department but get sprayed with all sorts of perfume]
",2
3493,SpongeBob,33," I always hate going in there!
",2
3494,Patrick,33," Yeah.
",2
3495,SpongeBob,33," [hears something strange] Wait! Listen! [Flying Dutchman is in his room]
",2
3496,SpongeBob,33," Never!
",2
3497,Flying Dutchman,33," Ok, then... [tries to zap SpongeBob but SpongeBob holds up the sock as protection] Give it to me!
",2
3498,SpongeBob,33," No! [Sock begins to tear]
",2
3499,Flying Dutchman,33," Wait, you're stretching out the elastic!
",2
3500,Patrick,33," It would seem we have reached an impasse.
",2
3501,Flying Dutchman,33," Pink one is right. Tell you what. You give me back the sock, and I'll give you...three wishes.
",2
3502,Patrick,33," Make it five.
",2
3503,Flying Dutchman,33," Four.
",2
3504,Patrick,33," Three. Take it or leave it.
",2
3505,Flying Dutchman,33," Ok...uhh, three. You get three wishes.
",2
3506,SpongeBob,33," Wow! Three wishes, Pat. Isn't that great?
",2
3507,Patrick,33," Wishes? I wish we had known that earlier! [clock goes backwards one minute]
",2
3508,Flying Dutchman,33," Okay, you got two wishes left. [Patrick smiles with embarrassment at an angry SpongeBob]
",2
3509,SpongeBob,33," Well, we still have two more. How exciting! I wish Squidward were here to see this! [falls through a hole in the Fly Of Despair and crashes onto his bed]
",2
3510,Squidward,33," Boy, I'm glad all that's over! [re-appears on the ship]
",2
3511,SpongeBob and Patrick,33," Squidward! You're back!
",2
3512,SpongeBob,33," Guess what? The Dutchman gave us three wishes! Patrick used the first one, and I guess I... [realizing] just used the second one.
",2
3513,Squidward,33," Well, then, the last one you owe me because you got me back into this mess!
",2
3514,Patrick,33," Wait! I think it belongs to me! [everyone starts to argue] Because I didn't really get a real wish, so why should you get a wish...
",2
3515,SpongeBob,33," Well, that's not right because... [their arguing devolves into incoherent yelling, babbling and shouting]
",2
3516,Flying Dutchman,33," That's enough! Using my mystic other-worldly powers, I shall decide who gets the last wish. [uses the eeny- meenie-minie-mo method] Eeny, meeny, miny, mo, catch a sailor by the toe, if he hollers, let him go, my mother told me to pick the very best one and... [finishing eenie-meenie-minie-mo] You are it! [stops on SpongeBob]
",2
3517,Squidward,33," Now, think, SpongeBob! We're about to get eaten. What can you wish for to make it so we don't get eaten?
",2
3518,SpongeBob,33," Don't worry, Squidward. I've got it all figured out. He won't be able to eat us because...I wish the Dutchman was a vegetarian! [Flying Dutchman turns into a vegetarian and SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward re-appear in front of SpongeBob's house but you can only see their heads]
",2
3519,"SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward",33," Hooray!
",2
3520,SpongeBob,33," We're home!
",2
3521,Patrick,33," You did it, SpongeBob. We're saved!
",2
3522,Squidward,33," But why have we been turned into fruits? [their bodies have been turned into fruits and they are in a blender]
",2
3523,Flying Dutchman,33," Hey, I get a wish too. Fruit prevents scurvy! [SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward bounce away in the blender] Hey, get back here with that! [Flying Dutchman chases them around the ship, which is now a hippie-themed Volkswagen with a main mast. Patchy reappears]
",2
3524,Old-time crowd,33," Hooray!
",2
3525,Patchy,33," And now, the moment you've all been waiting for, so get ready to blow milk out of your nose because we're gonna open a letter! The envelope please Potty. Thank you, my fine feathered assistant.
",2
3526,Potty,33," [Potty has a lighten fuse on his head] Brawk, you're not welcome.
",2
3527,Patchy,33," [Patchy blows his nose] Hey, Potty, do you smell something? Oh, Potty! That fuse in your head! I told you we're not doing that stunt!
",2
3528,Potty,33," Brawk, I didn't get the memo! Brawk! [Potty blows up along with Patchy; Patchy coughs up a feather and recovers from the blast]
",2
3529,Patchy,33," Well, that's it for Patchy's Pick. Hooray! [Potty collapses to the floor]
",2
3530,Flying Dutchman,33," That's enough! Using my mystic other-worldly powers, I shall decide who gets the last wish. [uses the eeny- meenie-minie-mo method] Eeny, meeny, miny, mo, catch a sailor by the toe, if he hollers, let him go, my mother told me to pick the very best one and... [finishing eenie-meenie-minie-mo] You are it! [stops on SpongeBob]
",2
3531,Squidward,33," Now, think, SpongeBob! We're about to get eaten. What can you wish for to make it so we don't get eaten?
",2
3532,SpongeBob,33," Don't worry, Squidward. I've got it all figured out. He won't be able to eat us because...I wish the Dutchman was a vegetarian! [Flying Dutchman turns into a vegetarian and SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward re-appear in front of SpongeBob's house but you can only see their heads]

[finishing eenie-meenie-minie-mo] You are it! [stops on Patrick]
",2
3539,SpongeBob,33," [worried] That's you Patrick! Make your wish!
",2
3540,Patrick,33," Umm...
",2
3541,Squidward,33," Wait, Patrick. Listen, I do not particularly want to be trapped here for all eternity. Eternity is a very long time... [demonstrates the length of eternity as if it were a piece of string. Patrick's eyes look at each end] Understand?
",2
3542,SpongeBob,33," [rushes in] Patrick, you've got to think harder than you ever thought before.
",2
3543,Patrick,33," Uhh...
",2
3544,SpongeBob,33," That's not going to do it! Think harder!
",2
3545,Patrick,33," [thinks harder] Uhh...
",2
3546,Squidward,33," [simultaneously with SpongeBob] Come on Patrick! Come on! What are you thinking about?
",2
3547,SpongeBob,33," [simultaneously with Squidward] Come on Patrick! Yes, think, think really hard! [Patrick goes really intensely thinking] Yes Patrick! You're doing good!
",2
3548,Patrick,33," [his head's toaster ejects bread] Okay! I got it!
",2
3549,Flying Dutchman,33," Your wish is granted!
",2
3550,Patrick,33," Oh, I'm sorry... Want some gum?
",2
3551,Squidward,33," You wished for gum?
",2
3552,Patrick,33," Well, if we're going to be there forever, we might as well have fresh breath!
",2
3553,Flying Dutchman,33," Ahh... Minty!
",2
3554,Flying Dutchman,33," That's enough! Using my mystic other-worldly powers, I shall decide who gets the last wish.

[finishing eenie-meenie-minie-mo] You are it! [stops on Squidward]
",2
3555,SpongeBob,33," Squidward! You get to have a wish! A great big wish!
",2
3556,Squidward,33," That's right! And you know what I wish?
",2
3557,Patrick,33," No!
",2
3558,Squidward,33," I wish that I never met you two barnacle-heads before in my entire life!
",2
3559,Flying Dutchman,33," Your wish is granted. [magically makes SpongeBob and Patrick not know Squidward]
",2
3560,SpongeBob,33," Hi there, my name is SpongeBob and this is my associate Patrick.
",2
3561,Patrick,33," Hi!
",2
3562,Squidward,33," That's not what I meant!
",2
3563,Flying Dutchman,33," Well then, since you've been choosing to get out of the way, it's time for dinner! [grabs out a metal knife and fork]
",2
3564,SpongeBob,33," [in the Flying Dutchman's belly] And what did you say your name was?
",2
3565,Squidward,33," [also in the Flying Dutchman's belly] I'm Squidward. I'm your neighbor.
",2
3566,SpongeBob,33," Oh, nice to meet you, Squidward. We have plenty of time to know each other, I guess. [laughs]

3573,Mr. Krabs,34," Come on SpongeBob, it's quittin' time. [the lights turn off and Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob walk out] I've got a card game tonight. [he locks the doors]
",2
3574,SpongeBob,34," Who're you playing cards with, Mr. Krabs? [we see the Chum Bucket across the street, with its lights still on]
",2
3575,Mr. Krabs,34," I'm going over to the Chum Bucket to play with Plankton. [SpongeBob gasps]
",2
3576,SpongeBob,34," [Gasps] Plankton! [a thought bubble appears over SpongeBob's head with Plankton inside] But Mr. Krabs, he's your arch-enemy. [he picks up a Krabby Patty] He's been trying to steal the Krabby Patty formula for years. [the Plankton in the thought bubble sees the Krabby Patty and goes to get it, but SpongeBob swats him with a fly swatter]
",2
3577,Plankton,34," Ouch. [the thought bubble disappears]
",2
3578,SpongeBob,34," Why would you play cards with him?
",2
3579,Mr. Krabs,34," Between you and me, Plankton is the worst card player in Bikini Bottom! [cut to him and Plankton holding cards and a giant stack of money on the table] Why, I've been taking him to the cleaners every Thursday night for fifteen years! [Mr. Krabs puts his cards down on the table and rakes in his money with his claws. Back to the present, Mr. Krabs' eyes have turned to dollar signs] I never lose! [the two start laughing and walk off their separate ways. Cut to morning where Mr. Krabs walks to work crying, and SpongeBob walks in laughing]
",2
3580,Mr. Krabs,34," [Sobbing]
",2
3581,SpongeBob,34," Taking him to the cleaners, that a hot one! [Mr. Krabs leans against the Krusty Krab doors] How'd the card game go last night, Mr. Krabs?
",2
3582,Mr. Krabs,34," I lost.
",2
3583,SpongeBob,34," Barnacles, Mr. Krabs. How much money did you lose?
",2
3584,Mr. Krabs,34," I didn't lose any money. [he sheds away a tear] I lost...
",2
3585,SpongeBob,34," Don't tell me you lost the Krusty Krab!
",2
3586,Mr. Krabs,34," I lost... [SpongeBob grabs him]
",2
3587,SpongeBob,34," Mr. Krabs, please tell me you didn't lose the Krabby Patty secret formula!
",2
3588,Mr. Krabs,34," I lost... [he points to SpongeBob] you!
",2
3589,SpongeBob,34," What?
",2
3590,Mr. Krabs,34," I bet your contract and I lost. [SpongeBob stares blankly, then laughs]
",2
3591,SpongeBob,34," Good one, Mr. Krabs. Well, I got to go make those Krabby Patties. [he begins to walk to the door, but Mr. Krabs' claw stops him.] [after continually walking and getting nowhere, he falls to the floor]
",2
3592,Mr. Krabs,34," I'm afraid you don't work here anymore. [Squidward runs out the door to the two]
",2
3593,Squidward,34," Please tell me this isn't a joke.
",2
3594,SpongeBob,34," Go on, Mr. Krabs. Tell him. Tell him all about your cruel, sick joke. [Plankton walks over]
",2
3595,Plankton,34," As much as I love cruel, sick jokes, I'm afraid he's not joking. [he points at SpongeBob] You work for me now, SpongeBob! [he whips out a bucket with the initials ""CB"" on it] Time to put on the official Chum Bucket bucket helmet. [Plankton jumps on SpongeBob's head, kicks off the Krusty Krew hat, and puts the bucket on his head. SpongeBob screams and runs to Mr. Krabs, knocking Plankton and the bucket off]
",2
3596,SpongeBob,34," But Mr. Krabs! I don't want to work for him! [he tugs at Krabs' shirt collar] I want to work for you here at the Krusty Krab! [he and Krabs start crying loudly and hug]
",2
3597,Mr. Krabs,34," I'm sorry, boy! It's all my fault!
",2
3598,Plankton,34," [pretending to sound genuinely sad] What kind of cold, heartless person would break apart such a loving relationship? [whips out a crowbar] I would! [he jumps up and uses the crowbar to pry SpongeBob off Krabs. SpongeBob goes flying with Mr. Krabs' arms still clung to him]
",2
3599,Mr. Krabs,34," SpongeBob!
",2
3600,SpongeBob,34," Mr. Krabs! [he slams into a cage and Krabs' arms fly off him. Plankton walks over and shuts the door]

3601,SpongeBob,34," Mr. Krabs!
",2
3602,Mr. Krabs,34," SpongeBob! [he cries] Can I have my arms back? [Plankton walks over and throws the arms on Krabs' head. Cut to the cage hovering over a spotlight and dropping SpongeBob into it]
",2
3603,SpongeBob,34," What is this place? [the lights turn on and screens with wires and gizmos start starting up. Sponge gasps. A giant boiler turns on. SpongeBob yelps. A light turns on and a calendar entitled ""Science!"" appears and the photo of the month is some nerd in front of a blackboard. Sponge screams. Plankton bursts open the doors]
",2
3604,Plankton,34," Ok, I'm ready for my Krabby Patty! [he walks over to SpongeBob]
",2
3605,SpongeBob,34," Actually, uh, Mr. Plankton, sir, I haven't, uh...
",2
3606,Plankton,34," Perhaps you don't understand. You work for me now [he jumps onto SpongeBob's knee] and as your new boss, I command you to make me a patty this instant, or I'll be forced to remove your brain and implant it in my robot chef! [we see a giant robot that bares a slight resemblance to SpongeBob] So get cooking. [he twangs SpongeBob's nose. Later, SpongeBob is in front of a weird looking grill. He picks up a spatula with a spring end. He puts his fingers to one of the holes in the grill and steam bursts from it. SpongeBob screams. He looks at a digital sign reading ""KITCHEN""]
",2
3607,SpongeBob,34," The sign says kitchen, but my heart says Jail. ♪A stove is a stove, no matter where you go.♪
",2
3608,Mr. Krabs,34," ♪A patty is a patty, that's what I say.♪
",2

",2
3617,Plankton,34," What is he doing? All these tears... and the showtunes... Why isn't he making the patties? Forget it. I'm going with plan B, I'll put his brain in the robot chef.
",2
3618,Plankton,34," Will you be quiet? I'm thinking! I've got it! To get to the SpongeBob, I'll show him compassion and understanding, then he'll give me what I want.
",2
3619,SpongeBob,34," [Sound of surprise]
",2
3620,Plankton,34," Hi!
",2
3621,SpongeBob,34," I'm sorry Plankton, I've tried my best. I'm not used to cooking this way! Please don't take my brain out!
",2
3622,Plankton,34," Hold it, SpongeBob, I'm capable of compassion and understanding.
",2
3623,SpongeBob,34," Really?! Then I would like to go back to the Krusty Krab.
",2
3624,Plankton,34," Let's not get carried away. Now what can I do to make you more comfortable here at the Chum Bucket?
",2
3625,SpongeBob,34," Well, I usually cook on a grill.
",2
3626,Plankton,34," You got it! [Plankton brings a grill into the Chum Bucket] Well it wasn't easy, but here it is! One old frying grill. How about we try it out?
",2
3627,SpongeBob,34," [gasps] Uh, it's just that I'm used to the grill facing that way.
",2
3628,Plankton,34," Say no more, I'll take care of everything. [Plankton pushes the grill] How about here?
",2
3629,SpongeBob,34," A little more to the left.
",2
3630,Plankton,34," How's this, SpongeBob?
",2
3631,SpongeBob,34," Move it over a little more.
",2
3632,Plankton,34," Here?
",2
3633,SpongeBob,34," Keep going.
",2
3634,Plankton,34," Here?
",2
3635,SpongeBob,34," Almost! That's it, just a little more...perfect! Right there! I don't know, it still doesn't feel right. [Plankton gasps]
",2
3636,Plankton,34," [cut to a blindfolded SpongeBob] Just a few more steps, SpongeBob. Ok, go ahead, take it off! [he removes the blindfold] It's an exact replica of the Krusty Krab kitchen!
",2
3637,SpongeBob,34," It is an exact replica! Here's the sink, the greasy fryers, the squeaky floorboards, and that thing! One Krabby Patty coming up, Mr. Krabs! [his face turns sad. wailing] Oh...Mr. Krabs!
",2
3638,Plankton,34," Don't cry, SpongeBob! I'll show you it's much better working for me! Is there anything that old skinflint Krabs wouldn't let you have?
",2
3639,SpongeBob,34," Well...there is one thing I've always wanted... [cut to SpongeBob with some fancy vibrating shoes on] Wow!
",2
3640,Plankton,34," So now do you have everything you need to make some Krabby Patties?
",2
3641,SpongeBob,34," Well... [cut to SpongeBob in a bubble bath, licking green mint ice cream]
",2
3642,Plankton,34," You ready to make some patties?
",2
3643,SpongeBob,34," Wait till I finish my ice cream! [cut to SpongeBob riding a toy car, with Plankton pushing him]
",2
3644,Plankton,34," [while pushing him] How about those patties?
",2
3645,SpongeBob,34," Faster! Faster! [cut to Plankton reading to SpongeBob a baby book]
",2
3646,Plankton,34," And then the littlest sea-elf said... [drool drops on Plankton. SpongeBob is sleeping. He wakes up] Huh? Steady, Plankton! It's all gonna pay off soon enough. Hey there, sleepy head, what do you say?
",2
3647,SpongeBob,34," All this preparation is making me hungry.
",2
3648,Plankton,34," Me too. You know what would really hit the spot? Why don't you whip us up a couple of Krabby Patties?
",2
3649,SpongeBob,34," Mmmm...I'm kind of in the mood for tacos.
",2
3650,Plankton,34," [laughs] Good one, SpongeBob. But really, why don't you go ahead and make us a patty?
",2
3651,SpongeBob,34," [yawning] No, I don't really feel like it!
",2
3652,Plankton,34," But I don't understand. [SpongeBob drinks soda from a cup] You have the grill, and the spatula, and the comfy chair. [loses his cool as he exposes his hands with fumes rising out] I rubbed your putrid feet!
",2
3653,Plankton,34," [growls in fury] I command you to make me a patty this instant!
",2
3654,SpongeBob,34," [crossing his arms in refusal] No!
",2
3655,Plankton,34," Don't back sass me!
",2
3656,SpongeBob,34," [mocking Plankton] Do ba da ma!
",2
3657,Plankton,34," What!? [SpongeBob blows a raspberry as he moons at him] That's it, mister! You just lost your brain privileges. [cut to Plankton outside of a lab] Finished! SpongeBob, come in here! Or should I say RobotBob Sponge...Chef...Pants... [to the audience] I put the brain in the robot, you know. You shouldn't have been a spoiled brat. You see, I always get what I want, and I want you to make me a Krabby Patty!
",2
3658,Plankton,34," [going mad] What? What!?
",2
3659,Robot SpongeBob,34," Get welded.
",2
3660,Plankton,34," [pressing the button on the control] Wait! I command you make me a Krabby Patty!
",2
3661,Robot SpongeBob,34," [reads comics and drinks oil] I don't wanna.
",2
3662,Plankton,34," [screams out of madness]
",2
3663,Mr. Krabs,34," [cut to the Krusty Krab] Well, old girl, this looks like our final chapter. [holds up an ""Out of Business"" sign] Huh?
",2
3664,Plankton,34," [crying] I can't take anymore. You've gotta take that yellow nightmare back! It's not worth it. I'm better off stealing a Krabby Patty fair and square.
",2
3665,Mr. Krabs,34," Um...Well... [taking off the ""Out of Business"" sign off the doors] a deal's a deal, Plankton. He's your headache now.
",2
3666,Plankton,34," Oh, please, have mercy, Krabs! I'll do anything! I beg of you!
",2
3667,Mr. Krabs,34," How 'bout... you give me fifty bucks, and I'll take him off your hands.
",2
3668,Plankton,34," It's a deal! I cheated anyway.
",2
3669,Mr. Krabs,34," Now, be gone with you, you puny pest! [Mr. Krabs throws Plankton back inside the Chum Bucket]
",2
3670,Plankton,34," Thank you! [a crashing sound is heard] Ouch.
",2
3671,SpongeBob,34," My brain and I are glad to be back, Mr. Krabs.
",2
3672,Mr. Krabs,34," Glad to have you back, lad. Now get to those patties! The lunch rush is a-comin'!
",2
3673,SpongeBob,34," [Yawns] I don't feel like it! Why don't you ask me later, crabby? [Mr. Krabs stares at him] I mean...I'll work all day for free! My treat! [runs to the kitchen]

3681,SpongeBob,35," [as he runs to Patrick's rock] Patrick! Patrick! Oh, Patrick! Are you ready to go jellyfishing? [Patrick comes out of his rock with a box, doing an acrobatic trick] 
",2
3682,Patrick,35," Oh, boy, am I!
",2
3683,SpongeBob,35," Here's your net. [Patrick glances at his box] Well, come on, Patrick! The jellyfish don't catch themselves.
",2
3684,Patrick,35," First, I have to put away my secret box.
",2
3685,SpongeBob,35," Secret box? You never told me about your... secret box! [SpongeBob tries to peek in the box, but Patrick pulls it away] 
",2
3686,Patrick,35," Hey, hands off, PeepingBob! This here is my secret box! Besides, if I showed you what was inside, it wouldn't be a secret anymore. Duh! [opens the box, laughs at it, and shuts it as SpongeBob tries to peek it] Oh, SpongeBob… if only you could see what's inside my secret box, it would change your life! [SpongeBob gets behind Patrick to see what's inside the box, but Patrick holds it to himself]
",2
3687,SpongeBob,35," It's okay, Patrick, I know all about secrets. 
",2
3688,Patrick,35," You do? 
",2
3689,SpongeBob,35," I've got a gazillion secrets! 
",2
3690,Patrick,35," Like what? 
",2
3691,SpongeBob,35," Well, it's not a secret that the best thing about a secret is secretly telling someone your secret, thereby secretly adding another secret to their secret collection of secrets. Secretly. [Patrick drools as the top of his head has lightning bolts coming out of it, showing that he couldn't understand the whole sentence] 
",2
3692,SpongeBob,35," You wanna hear one of my secrets? 
",2
3693,Patrick,35," Do I? 
",2
3694,SpongeBob,35," Uhh... Let's see... [he runs up to Patrick] Did you know that you're my best friend? [he runs away]
",2
3695,Patrick,35," No... way. Oh, let's hear another one! 
",2
3696,SpongeBob,35," Okay. Uhh... Secretly... I'm a little bit naive. 
",2
3697,Patrick,35," WOW! I'll never look at you the same way again, SpongeBob. Gosh. [SpongeBob clears his throat and taps on Patrick's box] Tell me some more secrets! 
",2
3698,SpongeBob,35," Okay. I love my job at the Krusty Krab, I sleep with my shoes on, I like jelly on both sides of my toast, I've got an overdue library book, I think Jelly-Fishing and Bubble-Blowing are the… [transition to SpongeBob still telling secrets as Patrick lays his head on the box] ...overbite. I've never been late for work, I've said the word ""fancy"" in conversation, I like to dance to loading zone announcements, I still don't have my driver's license. I'm a little bit on the short side. And I'm wearing three pairs of underwear right now. [he shows his three pairs of underwear to Patrick]
",2
3699,Patrick,35," Gasp. I never would have guessed. 
",2
3700,SpongeBob,35," Now will you show me what's inside your secret box? 
",2
3701,Patrick,35," No, SpongeBob! It's for me to know and for you to never find out. You may be an open book SpongeBob, but I'm a bit more complicated than that. The inner machinations of my mind are an enigma. [Patrick imagines a carton of milk spilling itself] 
",2
3702,SpongeBob,35," Oh, yeah?! Well, I got plenty a secrets stuff, too! Uhh… [close-up of SpongeBob's socks] I've got my secret socks on. [he runs away and comes back with Gary's bowl] And my secret Gary's bowl! [he runs away then comes back, pulling his television] My secret TV! [turns on the TV] And my secret TV channel. [the TV shows an off-air color bars screen] What do you think of that, Patrick? Patrick? 
",2
3703,Patrick,35," [he giggles, then laughs loudly after a gander at the box and then stops to breathe. He looks again and laughs harder and wildly. He stops to breathe] Maybe if you saw what was inside, you'd know why it has to be secret. [he shows the box to SpongeBob] Inside this very box is the most secret-y secret of all of secret-dom and I am it's sole witness! It's a heavy burden, SpongeBob, but nobody must know the secret of the box. [SpongeBob tries to peek inside the box, but Patrick slams it shut] Nobody! Not even… Squidward's house. [scene zooms out to show Squidward's Tiki Head home looking down at SpongeBob and Patrick, but it goes back to normal] It's a full-time job. I'm constantly on the alert. You never know when someone's gonna… [gasps when he finds out his box is gone, The scene cuts to SpongeBob running with Patrick's secret box, but then he bumps into Patrick's belly] SpongeBob! What do you think you're doing?! That's my secret box! Now, hand it over! 
",2
3704,SpongeBob,35," But, Patrick, I must know the secret! 
",2
3705,Patrick,35," For the last time, SpongeBob, no! 
",2
3706,SpongeBob,35," Come on, Patrick, just a peek? 
",2
3707,Patrick,35," Never! [SpongeBob and Patrick strain as they fight over the box. Eventually, SpongeBob's arms pop off and he gasps] So, it's come to this. And to think that we joined the Best Friends Forever Club! [he shows his finger with the ring on it and then the camera zooms in on the ring. He grabs one of SpongeBob's arms and points it at SpongeBob] Listen up, SpongeBob SecretStealerPants! [as he pokes SpongeBob's nose with his arm] If you ever come close to my secret box again, we won't be friends anymore! 
",2
3708,SpongeBob,35," But... we're supposed to be... [his eyes get big and sad] friends forever. [flashback to SpongeBob and Patrick as babies in a crib laughing, then we see them as kids riding on a bike, then as they are now, riding a bike, then as older men in rocking chairs, then we see a shot of two gravestones with their names and we hear SpongeBob and Patrick still laughing, but they are buried. The flashback ends.] I feel so filthy! [he starts to cry] I have soiled our friendship garden! I just couldn't help myself! [he jumps on Patrick] I know it's your secret! I promise to respect that! Oh, please forgive me, Patrick! Please! 
",2
3709,Patrick,35," Well... I guess it's not all your fault. After all, this is a pretty great secret. I mean, how could you resist the greatest secret ever? [we see a close-up of Patrick's box] The most amazing... [as he sticks the box in SpongeBob's eyes, the eyes pop out of him and then back in] mysterious... powerful secret in all Bikini Bottom. [he eyes are glued to the box for a moment, and then goes back to him]
",2
3710,SpongeBob,35," So, what do you say, buddy? Friends? 
",2
3711,Patrick,35," Friends. [they shake hands. Cuts to a night view of SpongeBob's house, then inside as SpongeBob talks]
",2
3712,SpongeBob,35," What could be in that box that Patrick doesn't want me to see? Maybe it's the world's only albino jellyfish! [he slides down in his bed] Or maybe Patrick's a master jewel thief and it's full of diamonds. [he sits up] Or maybe Patrick's a deranged maniac who keeps his victim's severed heads in a box. [he hides himself in the blanket and shivers] Or even worse! Maybe it's an embarrassing snapshot of me from the Christmas party! [screams, then jumps onto the bedroom window and talks a little muffled] I've gotta find out what's in that secret box! I'm not gonna rest until I do! [SpongeBob's face pops off and sticks onto his back] That's it! How do you look in a secret box? [he jumps off the window] Secretly, of course! I'll just take the box while Patrick's sleeping, look in that box, and before Patrick even has time to notice, I'll slide it back. [he turns around to show only his nose. He turns back around] Patrick won't know when I'll have my own little secret. Good idea, eh, Gary? 
",2
3713,Gary,35," Meeh… No. [cut to the outside] 
",2
3714,SpongeBob,35," Oh, what do you know, you're a snail! [SpongeBob sneaks to Patrick's house, puts gloves and a ski mask on him, crawls up the rock with his back, and tears him in half and gets both halves under the rock. He then lands and notices Patrick. He then screams gibberish, drools and SpongeBob hides behind the portrait of SpongeBob and Patrick. SpongeBob then peeks and then the wall starts to crack. Patrick mumbles, the wall breaks even more and then the nail falls off. He then grabs the nail with his foot and puts it back.] 
",2
3715,Patrick,35," [as the camera zooms in on the box] Seee... cret. 
",2
3716,SpongeBob,35," [thinking] I got to be more quiet. I don't want to wake Patrick up. [slides down the wall from the portrait and makes a loud noise upon touching the floor. Patrick stretches and then goes back to sleep. SpongeBob then lifts his leg and then Patrick makes another noise. He then tosses himself over on the bed. SpongeBob puts his leg down, which makes a loud noise]
",2
3717,Patrick,35," Duh... who's there? [he mumbles then goes back to sleep.]
",2
3718,SpongeBob,35," [talking to his foot] Shhh! [SpongeBob steps on a potato chip and makes a broken glass sound]
",2
3719,Patrick,35," EH?! [gibberish] WHO'S THAT?! [Patrick is back asleep. SpongeBob sweeps his sweat drops off him and they land, causing a loud splash sound.] Mmm... water. [he licks his mouth dry, then tosses himself on the bed. SpongeBob takes another step and makes an ""AWOOOOGA!"" noise. He then steps again, making a loud machine gun noise. Steps again, making the sound of an elephant. He then stretches his leg near the side of the bed, then takes the step, making a very loud crashing noise. He then peeks above Patrick to see the box. He gets ready to reach for the box, but Patrick takes the box before SpongeBob could grab it. He then slides onto Patrick, grabbing the box] Good old secret box. Let's see what's inside. [opens SpongeBob's mouth and pulls out his tongue, then laughs. He lets go of his tongue] Nighty-night, boxie. [he puts SpongeBob on the side of the bed. SpongeBob gets off the bed and then trips on a shoestring, causing him to bounce around Patrick's house, making a lot of loud noises until his head hits the wall, causing the portrait to fall off the wall, hitting him in the head, breaking the portrait half. The box then lands on SpongeBob and makes a loud noise. The scene cuts back to Patrick, who, despite all the noise, continues to sleep] 
",2
3720,SpongeBob,35," Gee, Patrick sure is a heavy sleeper. [Patrick wakes up]
",2
3721,Patrick,35," Huh? Who said that?! Who's there?! 
",2
3722,SpongeBob,35," Uh… 
",2
3723,Patrick,35," It's the Clam Burglar! And he's stealing my secret box! [he runs up to SpongeBob] Hand over the goods, Secret Box Bandit, and prepare for the most unpleasant pillow fight of your life! [he cocks his pillow like a shotgun]
",2
3724,SpongeBob,35," Wait, wait, wait, Patrick! Stop! It's me, SpongeBob! 
",2
3725,Patrick,35," Nice try, burglar, but SpongeBob's my best friend, and he'd never steal from me. 
",2
3726,SpongeBob,35," No, really, Patrick! Look! [Patrick gasps. SpongeBob presses a button on the ring]
",2
3727,SpongeBob and Patrick BFF Ring,35," It's the Best Friends Forever, Best Friends Forever Ring! 
",2
3728,Patrick,35," Our friendship ring! IT IS YOU! [crying as he covers his face with his pillow] How could you do thi-i-i-i-is?!?
",2
3729,SpongeBob,35," If it makes you feel any better, I haven't looked inside. [he throws the pillow away and snatches the box out of SpongeBob's hands]
",2
3730,Patrick,35," [with a tear coming out of his eye] That's it, SpongeBob! You have crossed the line. As of right now, this friendship is OVER!!! 
",2
3731,SpongeBob,35," [gasps and tears up] Really? 
",2
3732,Patrick,35," Nahhh, you can look inside it if you really want to. 
",2
3733,SpongeBob,35," OK! Oh, this is one the most exciting moments of my life! Well, here it goes! [he lifts the lid off the box] Huh? 
",2
3734,Patrick,35," Well, didn't I tell ya? [we see a string inside the box] Isn't it great? 
",2
3735,SpongeBob,35," It's just a string. 
",2
3736,Patrick,35," A secret string! 
",2
3737,SpongeBob,35," Boy, when you're right, you're right! That's some secret box you've got there! Yeah! Thanks for showing me that! [he puts the lid back on the box] Well, good night, Patrick. See you tomorrow! 
",2
3738,Patrick,35," Good night, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob pops out of Patrick's house]
",2
3739,SpongeBob,35," I should've known! It was just a piece of string all along! [he laughs] Wait 'till I tell Gary! 
",2
3740,Patrick,35," [laughs menacingly] Good thing he didn't pull the secret string, opening the... [a secret compartment opens] ...secret compartment of my secret box... [he takes out a photo] ...revealing one embarrassing snapshot of SpongeBob at the Christmas Party! [cut to the Bikini Atoll] Merry Christmas, SpongeBob!

",2
3765,SpongeBob,36," Psst, Squidward. I'm working in the kitchen [laughs] at night!
",2
3766,Squidward,36," [takes hat off; leans head on counter] Don't hold back.
",2
3767,SpongeBob,36," [cuts to SpongeBob in kitchen] Hey Squidward. Guess what, I'm chopping lettuce...at night. [cuts to SpongeBob in the bathroom wiping it clean with himself] Look at me, I'm swabbing the bathroom...at night. [cuts to SpongeBob at the grill picking up spatula, misses the spatula and hits the grill; screams] I burned my hand!...at night. [cuts to SpongeBob walking on the counter, singing to the tune of Charge] Night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, na-na-na-na-night! Night!
",2
3768,Squidward,36," Will you please?! Here, [hands SpongeBob a bag of garbage] give me a moment's peace and take out the trash!
",2
3769,SpongeBob,36," All right! [takes bag from Squidward] Taking out the trash. Taking out the trash...at night. [stops at the door] You mean outside?
",2
3770,Squidward,36," That's where the dumpster is, yes.
",2
3771,SpongeBob,36," I don't know, Squidward, [leans face against window] it's kinda dark out there.
",2
3772,Squidward,36," But I thought you liked the night shift.
",2
3773,SpongeBob,36," You're right! [lifts bag over his head] For the Krusty Krab! [runs out of the building to the dumpster, screaming and panicking the whole way; reenters the building panting heavily. snaps his fingers and confidently says] Piece of cake!
",2
3774,Squidward,36," So you're not afraid?
",2
3775,SpongeBob,36," Pfft, nah.
",2
3776,Squidward,36," Well I am. Especially after, [looks around, gulps] well, you know.
",2
3777,SpongeBob,36," [turns around] What? What do I know?
",2
3778,Squidward,36," You don't remember? It was all over the news.
",2
3779,SpongeBob,36," Tell me! Tell me!
",2
3780,Squidward,36," No, no, no, I probably shouldn't. It would ruin the night shift for you. [gives a sympathetic look, then smiles slyly]
",2
3781,SpongeBob,36," [excitedly] What happened, what happened, what happened!?
",2
3782,Squidward,36," You mean you've never heard the story of the [thinks] ""Hash-Slinging Slasher?""
",2
3783,SpongeBob,36," The Slash-Bringing Hasher?
",2
3784,Squidward,36," The Hash-Slinging Slasher!
",2
3785,SpongeBob,36," The Sash-Ringing, the Trash-Singing, Mash-Flinging, The Flash-Springing, Ringing, The Cr-Crash-Dinging, daa.
",2
3786,Squidward,36," Yes. The Hash-Slinging Slasher. But, most people just call him The Ha [breaks into scream] because that's all they have time to say before he gets them!
",2
3787,SpongeBob,36," [begging] Tell me the story!
",2
3788,Squidward,36," Years ago at this very restaurant, the Hash-Slinging Slasher used to be a fry cook - just like you - only clumsier. And then, one night, when he was cutting the patties ...it happened.
",2
3789,SpongeBob,36," He forgot the secret sauce?
",2
3790,Squidward,36," No.
",2
3791,SpongeBob,36," He didn't wash his hands?
",2
3792,Squidward,36," No!
",2
3793,SpongeBob,36," Irregular portions?
",2
3794,Squidward,36," NO! He cut off his own hand by mistake.
",2
3795,SpongeBob,36," You mean like this? [pulls one of his arms out of socket, another one grows back in its place] Or like this? [pulls it again, another one grows back] Or this? [does it again] Or this? [does it again] But what about this? Or this, or this, or this, or...
",2
3796,Squidward,36," [interrupts] Except he wasn't a sponge!
",2
3797,SpongeBob,36," [ask with all his extra hands creating a rainbow-like line] So?
",2
3798,Squidward,36," So it didn't grow back!
",2
3799,SpongeBob,36," [screams] Oh, no! [all his extra arms lift their hands upwards and run away]
",2
3800,Squidward,36," And he replaced his hand with a rusty spatula. And then, he got hit by a bus! And...at his funeral, they fired him! So now, every...what day is it?
",2
3801,SpongeBob,36," Tuesday.
",2
3802,Squidward,36," Tuesday night, his ghost returns to The Krusty Krab to wreak his horrible vengeance.
",2
3803,SpongeBob,36," [gasps] But tonight's Tuesday night!
",2
3804,Squidward,36," Then he'll be coming.
",2
3805,SpongeBob,36," How will we know?
",2
3806,Squidward,36," There are three signs that signal the approach of the Hash-Slinging Slasher. First, the lights will flicker on and off. Next...
",2
3807,Harold,36," [interrupts] Dude, can I have some ketchup?
",2
3808,Squidward,36," Oh, here you go. [hands him ketchup] Next, the phone will ring and there will be nobody there. [shows SpongeBob eating his fingernails] And finally, the Hash-Slinging Slasher arrives in the ghost of the bus that ran him over. [shows SpongeBob eating his fingernails, starts eating his arms, the arms regrow and he eats those and then he eats his arms like popcorn] Then he exits the bus and crosses the street without looking both ways because he's already dead! [SpongeBob begins eating his hands like popcorn] Then he taps on the window with his grizzly spatula hand..
",2
3809,SpongeBob,36," No.
",2
3810,Squidward,36," He opens the door [pushes his tentacle to SpongeBob's face, making it looking like he's a door that's being opened; while doing this he imitates the sound of a squeaky door opening. leans torwards SpongeBob's face, which sinks in] He slowly approaches the counter [""counter"" echoes menacingly] ...and you know what he does next?
",2
3811,SpongeBob,36," What?
",2
3812,Squidward,36," You really want to know?
",2
3813,SpongeBob,36," What?
",2
3814,Squidward,36," Are you sure you want to know?
",2
3815,SpongeBob,36," What, what, what does he do?!
",2
3816,Squidward,36," [sneaks up on SpongeBob, taps him] He gets ya! [SpongeBob now screams repeatedly for about 20 seconds while Squidward is laughing] SpongeBob... [continues screaming] SpongeBob I wa... [screaming continues] I was ju... [SpongeBob's pupils are now screaming too] I was jus... [screaming continues] SpongeBob, I was joking!
",2
3817,SpongeBob,36," What?
",2
3818,Squidward,36," It's not true! None of it's true!
",2
3819,SpongeBob,36," It's not?
",2
3820,Squidward,36," Of course not. Nobody has a spatula for a hand. It was all a joke.
",2
3821,SpongeBob,36," Ohhhhh. [laughs repeatedly like he did with screaming] [cuts into later in the night. Shows Krusty Krab with a big sign that says 'Open Forever']
",2
3822,SpongeBob,36," [on the ceiling wearing suction cups cleaning] Isn't this great, Squidward? [Squidward screams] There's never time to wash the ceiling during the day.
",2
3823,Squidward,36," [says to himself] Open 24 hours a day. What a stupid idea! Who wants a Krabby Patty at three in the morning?
",2
3824,Patrick,36," [Patrick's alarm clock goes off] Oh boy! Three A.M.! [whips out a Krabby Patty and starts to eat it; cuts back to The Krusty Krab]
",2
3825,Squidward,36," Just look at this place. It's like a ghost town in here! [lights start to flicker on and off] Very funny, SpongeBob.
",2
3826,SpongeBob,36," What?
",2
3827,Squidward,36," ""And the lights will flicker on and off."" Just like the story. I get it. [realizes no one is flickering the light switch and looks shocked]
",2
3828,SpongeBob,36," Hey Squidward, how are you doing that without moving the switch?
",2
3829,Squidward,36," I'm not doing it. It must be the stupid, faulty wiring in here. This place isn't built to run 24 hours a day! [phone rings, Squidward picks it up] What, what, hello? Hello? Hello?
",2
3830,SpongeBob,36," [walks up to the counter] Nice try, Squidward.
",2
3831,Squidward,36," Nice try, what?
",2
3832,SpongeBob,36," ""The phone will ring and there will be no one there."" [raises eyebrows up and down and giggles] Oh, you crack me up.
",2
3833,Squidward,36," SpongeBob, I'm not doing this. [hangs up phone] Oh no, calm down, calm down. All right, what was it? There was the lights, [lights flicker on and off] and the phone, [phone rings] and the walls will ooze green slime! [walls start to ooze green slime] No, wait. They always do that. But what was that third thing? [hears a motor, turns his head and opens his eyes wide; a bus pulls up to the Krusty Krab doors]
",2
3834,SpongeBob,36," [walks up to the counter] I didn't know the buses ran this late. 
",2
3835,Squidward,36," They don't! [a man gets out of the bus and the bus pulls away, all Squidward and SpongeBob can see is his spooky outline]
",2
3836,SpongeBob,36," Well they're dropping someone off. [from the outside, the man lifts his spatula]
",2
3837,Squidward,36," [screams to the point where hair grows from his head and starts wiggling]
",2
3838,Squidward,36," The SASH-RINGING, FLASH-SINGING, THE BASH-PINGING...
",2
3839,SpongeBob,36," The Hash-Slinging Slasher! [starts to cry]
",2

",2
3841,SpongeBob,36," No, that's not it. [wipes tear] I am just so touched that you would go through the trouble to dress up as a ghostly fry cook and stand on the other side of the street, just to entertain me! You must really like me! [cries again]

3842,Squidward,36," SpongeBob, there are two problems with your theory. One - I hate you. And two - how can that be me when I'm standing right here!? [the man taps on the door with his spatula]

3865,SpongeBob,37," Yeah, I know!
",2
3866,SpongeBob,37," OK Gary, no goofing off! I am about to write the greatest essay of all time. Like most great essays, it will be written on paper. Even more important than the paper is [holds up a pencil] the pencil. A pencil as sharp or as dull as I like. Hmm.. funny... as my ideas grow, you shrink. [kisses the pencil as little hearts fly out of it] Well, I couldn't have asked for a more beautiful day to write an essay. [looks at window, it's colorful outside] OK, here we go. What. Not. To do. At. A. Spotlight. Hey this is easy! By SpongeBob SquarePants. Hah! This essay is pure gold! And now pencil, get ready to do your stuff because here we go! [SpongeBob's clock is shown. Several hours pass and has still only written 8 words] Gee, this is harder than I thought... [looks outside. There is a carnival. Squidward is suntanning. A boy is eating ice cream. Jellyfish are playing tennis. Gary is riding on a ball and playing a horn. Patrick is rubbing Sandy with sunscreen]
",2
3867,Patrick,37," Come on, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob sinks back down out of sight of the window]
",2
3868,SpongeBob,37," It should be against the law to have to write an essay on such a super sailorific, sunshiny day. Oh! But I must press onward, because with this pencil, and the completion of this essay, I'll be one step closer to my driver's license! [a live-action drag race is shown. a car hits a wall, tumbles and gets back up. cut back to SpongeBob] Oh, yeah. This'll be no problemo. Why, I've got plenty of time. It's only-six o'clock! [cuts to SpongeBob's ticking clock, then back to SpongeBob at his desk] Okay, here we go, here we go. [SpongeBob struggles to write] Bah! I know! I just need to get a little blood pumpin' in the old noodle. How about some calisthenics? [does calisthenics. While doing it, he recites Hup Ho several times. His nose and eyelashes do the same thing.] I can feel those juices pumpin' now! [moves his chair closer to the table. he does it a lot because of the fun noise it makes. He then laughs] Huh? What am I doing?! I've gotta write that paper! [pushes his chair in] Come on pencil, make words.

[Gary quickly eats it] Gary, are-are you sure you don't want some creme brulée? Or, or some chocolate-flavored algae bits? [steps in Garys food] Gee, Gary sure made a mess. I can't work on my essay knowing there's a mess in the kitchen. [cleans it up using himself as a mop] Hmmm...I might as well clean the rest of the floor while I'm at it. I should get these hard-to-reach places too! And these dishes need to be cleaned! Can't have dirty garbage. [cut to SpongeBob, who has already finished] Well, I think it's clean enough now! Why that didn't take too long...and it's only...10 o'clock! Ooh... No more fooling around! I've gotta get back to work! Ok, Mr. Essay, I say... prepare to be written!

3879,Patrick,37," SpongeBob, you and I both know that you're just choosing me as a distraction so you don't have to write your essay.

3880,SpongeBob,37," [gasps] That is-that is not true! I called to have an engaging conversation with you!

[back to his desk with eraser shavings on his paper] I can't write with all these eraser shavings all over my paper! Now they're floating around my thinking space. [blows them away] So long Pesky Particles! [floats back to SpongeBob chokes on one] I swallowed one! I'm choking! Water, water! [goes to the kitchen and drinks water] That was a close one.

3893,Maifish,37," Oh brother..
",2
3894,SpongeBob,37," So, do you deliver your own mail or do you have your own mail person? But then who delivers his mail? Is there a never-ending chain of mailmen delivering mail to other mailmen? Well I guess a P.O. box could in theory break the chain...

3895,Mailfish,37," Don't you have a paper to write? [He walks away]

3991,Patrick,37," SpongeBob, you and I both know that you're just choosing me as a distraction so you don't have to write your essay.

3996,SpongeBob,37," Yeah, well I gotta get going Patrick, got an important essay to write? [hangs up phone] Sheesh, what a chatterbox. Can't he see that I'm busy? [back to his desk with eraser shavings on his paper] I can't write with all these eraser shavings all over my paper! Now they're floating around my thinking space. [blows them away] So long Pesky Particles! [floats back to SpongeBob chokes on one] I swallowed one! I'm choking! Water, water! [goes to the kitchen and drinks water] That was a close one.

4004,SpongeBob,37," Rye or pumpernickel? [laughs]
",2
4005,Maifish,37," Oh brother..
",2
4006,SpongeBob,37," So, do you deliver your own mail or do you have your own mail person? But then who delivers his mail? Is there a never-ending chain of mailmen delivering mail to other mailmen? Well I guess a P.O. box could in theory break the chain...
",2
4007,Mailfish,37," Don't you have a paper to write? [He walks away]
",2
4008,SpongeBob,37," [Gulps and zooms in on his face] How did he know I'm supposed to be writing an essay? [blipping his eyes and slides back into his house]

[holding his paper but the word ""The"" is still there, puts the paper down on the desk] Do I dare look at the clock..? [gasps] It's almost 9 o' clock! Class starts in 5 minutes! How am I going to write this whole paper in 5 minutes? How am I supposed to know what to do at a stoplight?? Feeding your snail is something not to do at a stoplight! [Writing] And making a sandwich, and lighting candles, and drinking water, and calling your friends, and karate chopping the TV, and shootin' the breeze with the mailman, and fallin' asleep... [cut to SpongeBob running to the boating school] Mrs. Puff! Mrs. Puff! I'm finished! All 800 words! I'm finished! Here it is! [goes inside, but nobody is there] Huh? Mrs. Puff? Where is everybody?

",2
4061,Old Man Jenkins,38," I thought this was a restaurant, not a gutter mouth convention.
",2
4062,SpongeBob,38," [taps on the microphone and speaks into it] Attention, customers, today's special is a [dolphin chirp] Krabby Patty served in a greasy [dolphin chirp] sauce and grilled to [dolphin chirp] perfection. [a mother octopus covers her laughing children's ears and puts soda on one since she doesn't have enough hands] And don't forget to ask us to [dolphin chirp] the [dolphin chirp] fries. It will be our [dolphin chirp] pleasure. [Squidward hears the intercom and a giant human ear pops out of his head; he pushes it back in] Hi Squidward, how the [dolphin chirp] are ya?

",2
4069,Squidward,38," Apparently, the two barnacle-mouth brothers just learned a new word, and SpongeBob just said it over the intercom.
",2
4070,Mr. Krabs,38," Well, what was it? What'd he say?
",2
4071,Squidward,38," Er...he said...um, well he said...

4072,Mr. Krabs,38," Huh? [Squidward whispers it again. Mr. Krabs gasps] SpongeBob and friend! Front and center! Why, I oughta make the two of you paint the Krusty Krab for using such language!
",2
4073,SpongeBob,38," But Mr. Krabs, we were only using our sentence enhancers.
",2
4074,Patrick,38," Yeah, it's fancy talk.
",2
4075,Mr. Krabs,38," There ain't nothing fancy about that word!
",2
4076,SpongeBob,38," You mean [dolphin chirp]?
",2
4077,Mr. Krabs,38," Yes, that one! Now quit saying that! It's a bad word!
",2
4078,SpongeBob and Patrick,38," Bad word?! [both start wiping their tongues]
",2
4079,Mr. Krabs,38," Yes sirree, that's bad word number 11. In fact, there are 13 bad words you should never use.
",2
4080,Squidward,38," Don't you mean there are only 7?
",2
4081,Mr. Krabs,38," Not if you're a sailor! [laughs]
",2
4082,SpongeBob,38," Wow, 13!
",2
4083,Patrick,38," That's a lot of [dolphin chirp] bad words!
",2
4084,Mr. Krabs,38," OK, boys. I want you to promise me you'll never use that word again.
",2
4085,SpongeBob and Patrick,38," We promise.
",2
4086,SpongeBob,38," Gee, I'm glad Mr. Krabs told us that word we were using was a bad word!
",2
4087,Patrick,38," Yeah, me too, because classy sophisticates like us shouldn't stain our lips with cursing.
",2
4088,SpongeBob,38," Yea, verily! Now, let's play a nice, wholesome game of Eels and Escalators.
",2
4089,Patrick,38," Oh, boy, my favorite! [Flops arms up and down like a seal]
",2
4090,SpongeBob,38," Come on, Gary needs a new pair of shoes! [rolls the dice]

4094,SpongeBob,38," Come on, escalators, escalators, escalators! [rolls dice] [sighs] Eels again.
",2
4095,Patrick,38," My turn! [rolls dice] Escalators!
",2
4096,SpongeBob,38," Escalators, Escalators, Escalators! [throws dice] Eels?
",2
4097,Patrick,38," [rolls dice] Es-skee-lators!! [moves to escalators] Well, this is your last chance, SpongeBob, or if you get eels again, you lose!
",2
4098,SpongeBob,38," [gets frustrated while rolling the dice] Escalators, escalators, escalators!! [dice is thrown and lands on escalators] Ha! Escalators! [dice turn over to eels]
",2
4099,Patrick,38," Eels...
",2
4100,SpongeBob,38," Ah, [dolphin chirp]! [covers his mouth when he realizes his mistake]
",2
4101,Patrick,38," Ooooh...! You said number 11!
",2
4102,SpongeBob,38," [babbles for Patrick to understand] I didn't mean... you gotta understand, Patrick, I was trying...what I meant to say was...some things just slip out. You gotta understand!
",2
4103,Patrick,38," Don't worry SpongeBob, I understand. [pause] Mr. Krabs! [runs out the door] Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs! [starts running to the Krusty Krab]
",2
4104,SpongeBob,38," [starts running after him] No wait, Patrick! [after SpongeBob catches up to Patrick] Patrick, no, please don't tell!
",2
4105,Patrick,38," But, you said ""[dolphin chirp]""! [Covers his mouth as he realizes his mistake]
",2
4106,SpongeBob,38," Aha! Now I'm gonna tell Mr. Krabs on you!
",2
4107,Patrick,38," Not if I tell first!
",2
4108,SpongeBob,38," I can run faster than you! [laughs]

4109,Patrick,38," [riding in an ice cream truck] See ya at the Krusty Krab! Ha, ha, ha! [the truck goes the wrong way] Oh no!
",2
4110,SpongeBob,38," [laughs] Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs!
",2
4111,Mr. Krabs,38," What, what, what?

",2
4115,Mr. Krabs,38," Out with it, boy!
",2
4116,SpongeBob,38," [talking fast] Me and Patrick were playing Eels and Escalators, and Patrick was going up-up-up, and I had to ride the eel and then we ran and Patrick, he said some things.
",2
4117,Mr.Krabs,38," [eyes SpongeBob] What kind of things?
",2
4118,SpongeBob,38," Well, he said...
",2
4119,Mr. Krabs,38," Yes?!
",2
4120,SpongeBob,38," Well, uh, let's just say he said a certain word that you said we shouldn't say, and this particular word happens to be number 11 in the 13 words you said shouldn't be said.
",2
4121,Mr. Krabs,38," Uh... Right, now what was that part about the, um... Who now?
",2
4122,Patrick,38," [walks in door of the Krusty Krab and eats an ice cream cone but throws away the cone] Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs! [Mr. Krabs sighs]
",2
4123,SpongeBob and Patrick,38," He said that word that you said we shouldn't say...!
",2
4124,SpongeBob,38," ...number thirteen...
",2
4125,SpongeBob and Patrick,38," Mmm-mmm...!
",2
4126,Mr. Krabs,38," Now I'm gonna let go of yer lips, and when I do, I want you to calmly tell me what youse need to tell me, understand?
",2
4127,SpongeBob and Patrick,38," Mmm-hmm... [Mr. Krabs lets go of their lips, which initally deflate, then reinflate; they both point at each other again] He said ""[dolphin chirp]""!
",2
4128,Mr. Krabs,38," [gasps] Do my ears deceive me?! You two should be ashamed! Time to take out the trash. [picks SpongeBob and Patrick up by their pants and carries them outside the Krusty Krab] You two need to be taught a lesson. I thought I made it clear. Never, and I mean, never use number 11 or any of the 13 bad words! Now the both of youse wait right here. I'll be back. [walks back in Krusty Krab]
",2
4129,Patrick,38," What's going to happen to us?
",2
4130,SpongeBob,38," We'll probably get 40 lashes!
",2
4131,Patrick,38," Oh, no! [stupidly imagines himself with 40 large, weird eyelashes]
",2
4132,SpongeBob,38," I'm sorry, Patrick. Mr. Krabs was right. There's no need for words like that.
",2
4133,Patrick,38," I'm sorry too, SpongeBob.
",2
4134,SpongeBob,38," Let's make a vow, Patrick. From this day forth a foul word shall never pass our lips! We'll be good citizens, just like good ol' Mr.Krabs.
",2
4135,Patrick,38," [shakes hands with SpongeBob] Agreed!
",2
4136,Mr. Krabs,38," All right, you two foul mouths. As punishment for FOULING the air in me restaurant with yer foul words, you're going to give the Krusty Krab a fresh coat of paint from top to bottom. [jams his foot on a rock then hops on one leg] Ow, Ooh! Ow! My [dolphin chirps] foot! What  [dolphin chirps] genius puts a [dolphin chirps] rock in a [dolphin chirps] path?! Can't you see I got a [boat horn no. 1] foot here?! Oh! [seal bark!. Continues saying a bunch of swear words, censored out by seagulls, foghorns, ship bells, etc.; at this moment, SpongeBob and Patrick count the swear words he uses]
",2
4137,SpongeBob,38," Five, six, seven...
",2
4138,Mr. Krabs,38," ...a whole lotta [old-style foghorn] and with a side of [dolphin chirp], a heapin' helpin' of [ship's bell] and a boatload of [boat horn no. 4] ...

4139,Patrick,38," Nine...

4140,Mr. Krabs,38," [seal bark, sea gull, and a new-style foghorn]! [cries in pain]

4141,SpongeBob,38," [cuts to SpongeBob with 13 fingers] That's all 13, Patrick!! [gasps] We're gonna tell your mom, Mr. Krabs!
",2
4142,Mr. Krabs,38," [worried] No, please, not me mommy! [SpongeBob and Patrick laugh as they run to Mama Krabs' house, Mr. Krabs runs after them] Wait, please don't tell me mother! I don't think her little old heart can take it!

4143,SpongeBob and Patrick,38," [repeatedly banging on the door] Mama Krabs, Mama Krabs!
",2
4144,Mama Krabs,38," Why, hello there!
",2
4145,SpongeBob,38," Mama Krabs, he said [dolphin chirp] and then he said [dolphin chirps] again and said [dolphin chirps] and then he screamed at the top of his voice [foghorn blows]! And he--(horn honks)--Mrs. Krabs, he didn't care! Such a stream of [seagull caws, foghorn, ship's bell] I have never heard in my days!
",2
4146,Mama Krabs,38," [shocked] Oh, dear! My poor old heart. [faints]
",2
4147,Mr. Krabs,38," [gasps] Oh, dear Mother! What have these foul-mouthed heathens done to you? [takes a coin out of her pocket] You two should be ashamed! Making an old lady faint with your sailor talk!
",2
4148,Mama Krabs,38," [wakes up] You should all be ashamed! And if you're gonna talk like sailors, then you're gonna work like sailors!
",2
4149,Mama Krabs,38," I guess you three scallywags have earned a glass of lemonade! Ah-ga-ga-ga-ga! [laughs like Popeye, then stubs her foot on a rock] Yeeeoww! My [Klaxon horn] foot!

4175,Mr. Krabs,39," [sniffs the patty suspiciously] Messing with the patty's formula, that's mutiny! Why I oughta...!

4178,SpongeBob,39," You okay Mr. K?
",2
4179,Mr. Krabs,39," SpongeBob, I got a proposition for ye. How's about you go catch me some of those little moneyfish?
",2
4180,SpongeBob,39," Oh boy. Getting paid to jellyfish. That's my life's dream!
",2
4181,Mr. Krabs,39," Well, keep dreaming. [Mr. Krabs gives him a jellyfish net] This'll be on your time.
",2
4182,SpongeBob,39," Aye, aye, sir!
",2
4183,Mr. Krabs,39," Now go get me some jellyfish, and make it [SpongeBob holds up a jellyfish in a jar] ...quick. Uhh, SpongeBob? We're gonna need more than one puny jellyfish.
",2
4184,SpongeBob,39," But, sir, how many jellyfish do you need?
",2
4185,Mr. Krabs,39," SpongeBob, we have a whole ecosystem full of hungry paying customers. [Mr Krabs starts dramatizing depressing emotions] Oh no! Don't tell me! You've stopped caring for the customer!
",2
4186,SpongeBob,39," [gasps] No! Never!
",2
4187,Mr. Krabs,39," [optimistically] Then go out there and get me some more jellies!
",2
4188,SpongeBob,39," Okay, Mr. Krabs. Just make sure the jellyfish are comfortable. They are oh, so sensitive. [leaves]
",2
4189,Mr. Krabs,39," [sinisterly, to himself] Oh, I'll keep 'em comfortable all right, inside me wallet! [chuckles]
",2
4190,SpongeBob,39," [jellyfishing with many nets. He then shows up with three jars] Here you go, Mr. Krabs!
",2
4191,Mr. Krabs,39," [painting a sign saying ""Home of the Jelly Patty""] I'm gonna need more than that, boy.
",2
4192,SpongeBob,39," [cuts a rope. Many jellyfish are inside it. He shows up with five jars] More jellies, Mr. Krabs!
",2
4193,Mr. Krabs,39," [painting jellyfish on the walls of the Krusty Krab with the words ""I Love Jellyfish"" on his shirt] Oh, that'll never do. More!
",2
4194,Mr. Krabs,39," [customers are lined up] More, SpongeBob!
",2
4195,Mr. Krabs,39," What don't you understand about... more!
",2
4196,Mr. Krabs,39," More! [SpongeBob catches two jellyfish with a net] More! [SpongeBob catches a jellyfish with a jar] More! [SpongeBob catches some jellyfish with a net while jumping leftwards to the screen] More! [SpongeBob tries to catch some jellyfish with a net by jumping rightwards to the screen] More... [SpongeBob manages to catch some more jellyfish with a net by jumping leftwards to the screen. Mr. Krabs now appears as a hideous caricature, popularly known as ""Moar Krabs.""] More! [SpongeBob's catching goes wildly fast. Mr. Krabs now appears normal, but continually appearing] More, more, more, more! More, more! More! [Cut to night. A sign reading ""Jellyfish Fields. Pop. 0"" is seen. ""4 Million"" is crossed out]
",2
4197,SpongeBob,39," Well, there's no more! Now, that's jellyfishing!

4199,Businessman,39," [hiding behind rock with another businessman] I told you he was onto us!

4200,SpongeBob,39," [running away] I'm not interested in anything you're selling! [opens the door to his house and gets in] I sure felt like... [laughs] I must be working too hard. [telephone rings] I'll get it, Gary! Hello, SpongeBob's house, SpongeBob speaking. Hello?
",2
4201,No Name,39," [breathing]
",2
4202,SpongeBob,39," [laughing nervously] Wrong number. [No Name has pliers and cuts the living room fuse and the lights go out. SpongeBob laughs nervously] I guess Gary forgot to pay the electric bill! [door opens and a small, black figure comes in] Gary, is that you? Gary? [the figure goes inside the kitchen] Uh, yeah, good idea, Gary, there's probably some candles in the kitchen. [light shines on a Krabby Patty with blue jellyfish jelly] Hello, what's this? What are you doing here, oh delicious one? A little snack will calm my nerves! Mmm... a Krabby Patty with blue jelly. [gasps] Blue jelly! [No Name shows up] Hey, old No Name? What's happening?
",2
4203,No Name,39," [buzzing, shows a net and jar]
",2
4204,SpongeBob,39," No Name, let me out! What are you gonna do with me? Pee-yew! What smells like big business? [No Name shows a factory] Hey, I don't remember that factory! [No Name shows him the inside] Huh? [Jellyfish are inside tubes. They are being sucked of their jelly. The dried out ones are put in trash cans. SpongeBob gasps] What is this horrible place? [a robot is tickling a jellyfish]
",2
4205,Robot,39," Coochie coochie coo. [jellyfish sneezes the jelly out and dries up]
",2
4206,SpongeBob,39," What kind of monster is responsible for this horror?
",2
4207,Mr. Krabs,39," [on an exercising machine with headphones] That's it, boys! Keep that gelatinous gold mine flowing! [laughs]
",2
4208,SpongeBob,39," Mr. Krabs? No! Now I know why you brought me here. But what can we do? [Mr. Krabs is listening to the song ""Give It All You've Got."" SpongeBob breaks in riding on No Name] Mr. Krabs! Stop this madness! Stop it right now!
",2
4209,Mr. Krabs,39," Uh... uh... This... This isn't what it looks like, SpongeBob! Why... uh... We're just... uh... having a little tea party!
",2
4210,SpongeBob,39," Oh, boy! A tea party! [No Name touches him] You tricked me, Mr. Krabs! I wouldn't have collected all those jellyfish if I knew that this was their fate! This isn't right! Jellyfish need wide-open space and fresh air!
",2
4211,Mr. Krabs,39," Easy boy, what are you doing with that?
",2
4212,SpongeBob,39," [holding an alligator wrench]  Something that should've been done a long time ago!
",2
4213,Mr. Krabs,39," No!
",2
4214,SpongeBob,39," The squeaky bolt on this door was driving me crazy!
",2
4215,Mr. Krabs,39," [relieved] Whew!
",2
4216,SpongeBob,39," And now I'm gonna set these jellyfish free! [tries to open it, but is unsuccessful]
",2
4217,Mr. Krabs,39," [laughs] Well, you can't. The door's voice-activated and will only open if I say ""open"". [Covers his mouth. The sign on the door lights the words ""OPEN"" and the jellyfish escape]
",2
4218,SpongeBob,39," Freedom! Freedom!
",2
4219,Mr. Krabs,39," You'll never catch me! [He pedals but the exercising machine is bolted to the ground] Blasted exercise craze! [jellyfish sting him and he screams in pain]
",2
4220,SpongeBob,39," [jellyfish escape out the doors] Goodbye, friends!
",2
4221,Mr. Krabs,39," [walks out and is incredibly burned] I'm taking jelly off the menu. [leaves]
",2
4222,SpongeBob,39," He really got burned on that deal! [laughs] All is as it should be. [brings put his jellyfish net] I promise never to use this jellyfish net for anything but pure sport again. Jellyfish aren't meant to be captured forever! [No Name floats in SpongeBob's net. He gasps] Oh, No Name! I guess I can name you now. I'll call you... ""Friend."" [reaches his arm out. No Name does, but accidentally stings SpongeBob. He nervously smiles]",2

",2
4280,Squidward,40," Alright SpongeBob, now listen up. I'm going to have to teach you how to strike. First, we must get rid of our uniforms, [He takes off his hat] they are a symbol of our oppression. I want you to throw your hat on the ground like so. [Squidward throws it into the ground and stomps on it] Now, stomp it into the dust! Your turn, SpongeBob.
",2
4281,Squidward,40," That's the idea. Now, throw it on the ground.
",2
4282,SpongeBob,40," [screams in frustration] I can't do it, Squidward. This hat is my friend! It never oppressed me.
",2
4283,Squidward,40," SpongeBob, you're pathetic. Look, I threw my hat to the ground.
",2
4284,Officer John,40," Aha! A confession! Next time, think before you litter.
",2
4285,Squidward,40," Okay, pay attention, SpongeBob. Now we're going to make picket signs. This is a very important part of striking.
",2
4286,SpongeBob,40," Like this, Squidward?
",2
4287,Squidward,40," Not a picket fence, you ding-dong. Picket sign!
",2
4288,SpongeBob,40," How's this?
",2
4289,SpongeBob,40," How's this, Squidward?
",2
4290,Squidward,40," SpongeBob, it's ""unfair,"" not ""funfair""!
",2
4291,Sandals,40," A funfair? Where? I could go for some fun.
",2
4292,SpongeBob,40," At the Krusty Krab.
",2
4293,Sandals,40," Hey everybody! Let's go to the fun fair! [A crowd of fish trample Squidward to get the restaurant. Later, SpongeBob is holding a sign that says ""No Fair!"" on it]
",2
4294,SpongeBob,40," Krusty Krab is unfair! Mr. Krabs is in there! Standing at the concession! Plotting his oppression!
",2
4295,Teenage Fry Cook,40," What the heck does that mean?
",2
4296,SpongeBob,40," I don't know. Squidward told me to yell it at people.
",2
4297,Teenage Fry Cook,40," Then you must be SpongeBob SquarePants!
",2
4298,SpongeBob,40," Yep!
",2
4299,Teenage Fry Cook,40," Dude, you are like a fry cook legend! Will you sign my spatula?
",2
4300,SpongeBob,40," Anything for an aspiring fry cook. [SpongeBob signs the spatula] So, did you come down to help out the cause?
",2
4301,Teenage Fry Cook,40," No, I came to take your job.
",2
4302,Teenage Fry Cook,40," Hey, thanks, dude!
",2
4303,Squidward,40," Attention, SpongeBob! You are a terrible striker! [SpongeBob inserts his eyes into their sockets] You just let your replacement cross our picket line without so much as a single threat.
",2
4304,SpongeBob,40," I'm sorry, Squidward. [He holds up a sign reading, ""I Heart the Krusty Krab""] How about I try the signs again?
",2
4305,Squidward,40," [into megaphone] Forget the signs! I've got something for you to do. Go stand over there.
",2
4306,SpongeBob,40," Like this, Squidward?
",2
4307,Squidward,40," Almost. A little more to the right. And... perfect. [We see that SpongeBob is now hidden behind the telephone pole. As Squidward begins to speaks, a crowd gathers] Attention, people of Bikini Bottom! You have been cheated and lied to!
",2
4308,Miss Shell,40," I knew it!

",2
4311,Francis,40," I don't know, but he's got a megaphone.
",2
4312,Squidward,40," We will dismantle oppression board by board! We'll saw the foundation of big business in half, even if it takes an eternity!
",2
4313,SpongeBob,40," [From behind pole] Gee, I don't know what Squidward's talking about, but he sure sounds convincing.
",2
4314,Squidward,40," With your support, we will send the hammer of the people's will crashing through the windows of Mr. Krabs' house of servitude!
",2
4315,Billy (lime fish),40," Wow, all this supporting is making me hungry.
",2
4316,Sandals,40," Hey, everybody! Let's go get a Krabby Patty.
",2
4317,Squidward,40," Nobody gives a care about the fate of labor as long as they can get their instant gratification.
",2
4318,SpongeBob,40," That was a great speech, Squidward. You practically had them eating out of your hands.
",2
4319,Mr. Krabs,40," But they didn't, did they, Mr. Squidward? 'Cause they were too busy eating out of mine. I wish you two had gone on strike earlier. Thanks for attracting all these paying customers with all your signage and your sloganeering!
",2
4320,SpongeBob,40," Alright, Mr. Krabs. You've gone too far this time. You can pick on me, but Squidward is a great leader. We are workers united! We're tired of your smelly greed! And we're gonna saw all your tables, and we're gonna smash stuff with the people's hammer. And we're gonna... we're gonna... Squidward, what was that other part?
",2
4321,Squidward,40," Dismantle your oppressive establishment?
",2
4322,SpongeBob,40," Yeah, that too!
",2
4323,SpongeBob,40," And me and Squidward are gonna stay on strike until we get what we deserve! Even if it takes forever!
",2
4324,Squidward,40," On strike with SpongeBob... forever? [He imagines himself as an old man with a white beard holding a sign reading, ""Krusty Still Unfair."" Cobwebs branch from him to the ground. An old SpongeBob approaches him, supported by a cane]
",2
4325,SpongeBob,40," Hey, Squidward. I bet old man Krabs is going to break any day. [tugs Squidward's beard] Eh, Squidward? Eh, Squidward? [bonks Squidward on the head with his cane] Eh, Squidward? Eh, Squidward? [floats around Squidward] Eh, Squidward? Eh, Squidward?
",2
4326,Squidward,40," I gotta beg Mr. Krabs for my job back and put an end to this nightmare!
",2
4327,Mr. Krabs,40," Oh! Uh, evening, Mr. Squidward. Uh... I was just in the neighborhood and I, uh... thought I'd drop by to... beg you to come back to work! The Krusty Krab is a wreck! I'm ruined without you and the little yellow guy. [He grovels at Squidward's feet] The teenagers I hired is ruining the place! And the worst part is, they won't leave me alone!
",2
4328,Teenagers,40," Alright, Mr. Krabs!
",2
4329,Mr. Krabs,40," See what I mean? Squidward, please, you got to come back.
",2
4330,Squidward,40," You'll give us anything we want?
",2
4331,Mr. Krabs,40," Yes, anything. So what do you say, Mr. Squidward?
",2
4332,Squidward,40," Your story breaks my heart, Mr. Krabs. Why don't we take a little walk and, uh... discuss my terms.
",2
4333,Mr. Krabs,40," I got a bad feeling in the pit of me wallet.
",2
4334,SpongeBob,40," Gee, being on strike with Squidward sure is a kick. Squidward's words are still buzzing around in my head like an angry jellyfish. Squidward was right! I can't just sit here, it's time for action! [He kicks open his front door, hammer and saw in hand. He runs to the Krusty Krab and into the dining room] I will restore the working man to his rightful glory. I will dismantle this oppressive establishment board by board! [He pulls up a loose floorboard. He then saws a table in half] I will saw the tables of tyranny in half. Gnaw at the ankles of big business! [He takes a bite out of a wooden column. Mouth full] Squidward will be so proud!
",2
4335,Mr. Krabs,40," Well, Squidward, those were intense negotiations.
",2
4336,Squidward,40," I'm glad you saw it our way, Mr. Krabs.
",2
4337,Mr. Krabs,40," Now I can fire them teenagers and get me two golden boys back. Well, see you at work!
",2
4338,Squidward,40," S-Sp-SpongeBob! W-W-What have you done?
",2
4339,SpongeBob,40," I did exactly as you said, Squidward. I dismantled the establishment! Now we'll get our jobs back for sure.
",2
4340,Mr. Krabs,40," Squidward! SpongeBob!
",2
4341,Both,40," Yes, Mr. Krabs?
",2
4342,SpongeBob,40," Here it comes!
",2
4343,Mr. Krabs,40," In order to pay off these damages, you two are going to work for me forever!

[Laughs] For a second there, I mistook you for a threat. But you're just a dirty little man. [Mr. Krabs flicks Plankton away] So long, shrimp! [An actual shrimp who was exiting the Krusty Krab turns around. Plankton is in mid-air]
",3
4357,Plankton,41," Curse you, Mr. Krabs! [Plankton finally lands in the Chum Bucket. He walks in sighing] Ouch!
",3
4358,Karen,41," So, typical day of failure, I see, huh darling?
",3
4359,Plankton,41," Oh, can it, computer wife. Can't you see I'm exhausted? Why don't you go make yourself useful and synthesize me up some grub? [opens the fridge to get a can of soda]
",3
4360,Karen,41," Yes, your majesty. [Holographic meatloaf appears on the table that Plankton's sitting at. Plankton sits at his table.]
",3
4361,Plankton,41," What do we got here? [sarcastically] Oh, goody. Holographic meatloaf again! When am I gonna get some real food? Mr. Krabs gets to eat real food. Just look at his daughter, she's a big as a whale. I wish I could be successful like Mr. Krabs. [opens his can of soda that he got from his fridge] I wish I could somehow just switch lives with him. Just to know what it's like. [Drinks some soda]
",3
4362,Karen,41," Then why don't you just use that ""Switch-Lives-Just-To-Know-What-It's-Like-O-Mogrifier"" thing you built last Tuesday? [Plankton spits out his soda]
",3
4363,Plankton,41," What a brilliant idea! Your parents must have been like, part computer or something. [Karen sighs. Plankton sits down in front of the Switch-Lives-Just-To-Know-What-It's-Like-O-Mogrifier] Now, let's see here. [A picture of a jellyfish shows up on the Switch-Lives-Just-To-Know-What-It's-Like-O-Mogrifier] No... [a dolphin appears] no... [a mermaid appears] no... [Finally, a picture of a crab in the shape of Mr. Krabs shows up] A-ha! [Plankton is buckled up] Well, I hate to leave you, Karen, but you know what they say... a rolling stone gathers no algae! [Plankton presses a button, and then goes through a hole of space and time and screams. Plankton stops for a few seconds to get a drink of soda. He smacks his lips afterwards] Ahh... [he then resumes screaming. Later, Plankton wakes up at Mr. Krabs' desk] Ugh... dear Neptune above, what happened last night? Huh, what's this? [Plankton picks up a name plate reading ""Mr. Plankton""] Mister Plankton? [Plankton picks up a picture of Pearl] Who the Davey? [Plankton looks out the office windows and sees people eating Krabby Patties] Ehh... I'm in the Krusty Krab... and that means the life switcher was a success! The Krusty Krab is mine! [Plankton sees himself dressed] Corporate casual!
",3
4364,SpongeBob,41," Order up! Two deluxe Krabby Patties.
",3
4365,Plankton,41," [Plankton's eye turns into a Krabby Patty] At last!
",3
4366,SpongeBob,41," [SpongeBob delivers food to customer] There you are sir. Two deluxe... [Plankton appears at the table] Ahoy there, Mr. Plankton.
",3
4367,Plankton,41," Er, um, hey there, uh SpongeBob. Uh, SpongeBob?
",3
4368,SpongeBob,41," Yes sir!
",3
4369,Plankton,41," I'm gonna need to take one of these Patties back to my office for um, bun inspection.
",3
4370,SpongeBob,41," I'm afraid you can't do that, Mr. Plankton!
",3
4371,Plankton,41," Why- why not?
",3
4372,SpongeBob,41," Because that Patty is for the customer, sir!
",3
4373,Plankton,41," The customer? I'll boil the customer in hot oil, and rip out his— [SpongeBob's eyes point to the customer, to stop Plankton] I mean uh, yes, of course, for the lovely... customer.
",3
4374,SpongeBob,41," [SpongeBob gives Plankton two Krabby Patties] But you can take these Patties, sir. I made them in the off chance that you'd decide to instigate some bun inspection today, Mr. Plankton, sir!
",3
4375,Plankton,41," Uhh... yes, uh, very nice. Um, thanks. [Plankton runs back to his office] All mine, it's finally all mine! The Patties... [shows Mr. Plankton's rich wealth in his money vault] The wealth... [shows business award and Clams Magazine award frames on the wall] The notoriety! The... [Plankton sees SpongeBob in his office] SpongeBob, what do you want?
",3
4376,SpongeBob,41," Well, it's just that it's Tuesday again, sir, and I was wondering if I could have my, um... weekly performance review!
",3
4377,Plankton,41," Review?
",3
4378,SpongeBob,41," Oh yes, please sir, please!
",3
4379,Plankton,41," But I've never reviewed anything... except those foreign exercise videos my cousin sent me.
",3
4380,SpongeBob,41," Oh, please, sir! I want to make you so happy and proud!
",3
4381,Plankton,41," Eh, you're doing fine. Now leave me to my work. [kisses one of the two Krabby Patties]
",3
4382,SpongeBob,41," But sir!
",3
4383,Plankton,41," I thought I sent you away, Cretin.
",3
4384,SpongeBob,41," But sir, there's gotta be something I need to improve on. Anything!
",3
4385,Plankton,41," All right, the sauce.
",3
4386,SpongeBob,41," [gasps] Wh-what?
",3
4387,Plankton,41," The sauce. I don't know. You're using too much sauce, okay? Review's over.
",3
4388,SpongeBob,41," [SpongeBob's face changes into a stereotypical Asian face. Jerkily moves arms in and out each time he stutters out the following words...] Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh...
",3
4389,Plankton,41," What?
",3
4390,SpongeBob,41," Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh...
",3
4391,Plankton,41," What's the matter with you? All I said was ""A little too much sauce."" It's no big deal, really.
",3
4392,SpongeBob,41," Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh...
",3
4393,Plankton,41," What do you want from me, a promotion?
",3
4394,SpongeBob,41," [SpongeBob's face changes back to normal] A pro- a promo- a promotion?!
",3
4395,Plankton,41," Uh, sure kid, you're uh... you're on register now.
",3
4396,SpongeBob,41," [Gasps excitedly] Register! [SpongeBob explodes. Plankton gets back to the Krabby Patties]
",3
4397,Plankton,41," Glad that's over. [Kisses the same Krabby Patty]
",3
4398,Squidward,41," [Squidward standing at the cash register reading a book, when he realizes that SpongeBob is standing right next to him] SpongeBob, do you remember that little talk we had about 'personal space'?
",3
4399,SpongeBob,41," It's okay, Squidward. I'm official, look!
",3
4400,Squidward,41," [SpongeBob points out his badge that says ""Co-Cashier""] Co-Cashier?
",3
4401,Plankton,41," [Plankton is sitting at a table with the two Krabby Patties.] So, have you two known each other long? [Candle suddenly extinguishes by itself as the door opens suddenly] Huh?
",3
4402,Squidward,41," [Squidward storms into Mr. Plankton's office] You can't do this to me, Mr. Plankton! If you think I'm going to stand out there all day listening to... [Cuts to SpongeBob, whose mouth splits in two while SpongeBob talks rubbish]
",3
4403,SpongeBob,41," Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah... [Cuts back to Squidward]
",3
4404,Squidward,41," Then you must have coral wedged in your frontal lobe!
",3
4405,Plankton,41," So what do you want me to do about it?
",3
4406,Squidward,41," I'd like my view to be a little less yellow, if you know what I mean.
",3
4407,Plankton,41," [Squidward's now the fry cook, standing in front of the grill] Hope you like gray. [Hops off the window between the cashier stand and the grill]
",3
4408,SpongeBob,41," Hey Squidward, I can see you through this little window!
",3
4409,Plankton,41," [Squidward groans. Plankton heads back to his office] Now, no more intrusions! I'd like the begin writing the memoirs of my success story, so everyone just stay the—
",3
4410,Pearl,41," [Pearl runs inside the Krusty Krab. [Plankton is being bounced up and down as she runs in.] Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy! [Jumps up and down, making him bounce again]
",3
4411,Plankton,41," Just tell Daddy what you want! Oof! He's very busy!
",3
4412,Pearl,41," Could I please have a um... an advance on my allowance?
",3
4413,Plankton,41," If it'll get you out of my antennae. [Plankton gives Pearl a one dollar bill] Go crazy.
",3
4414,Pearl,41," One dollar? You hate me! [Pearl begins to cry. Shows closeup of the enormous tears. Plankton attempts to dodge all of the tears, but one of ends up landing in his mouth, making him a circle]
",3
4415,Plankton,41," Ow!
",3
4416,Nat,41," [A fish walks out and angrily flattens Plankton, getting all of the water out] You!
",3
4417,Plankton,41," Me?
",3
4418,Nat,41," You think this is funny?
",3
4419,Plankton,41," In a cosmic sort of way, yes.
",3
4420,Nat,41," Well, Mr. Funny Man, is this how you get your sick kicks?! [Nat shows Plankton a Krabby Patty]
",3
4421,Plankton,41," What? It's just an ordinary Krabby— [Scene zooms in to show the patty made with gross-out items] Oh, my goodness! Squidward!
",3
4422,SpongeBob,41," [SpongeBob appears at the table, next to Plankton] I tried, Mr. Plankton. I really did.
",3
4423,Plankton,41," Oh, what now?
",3
4424,SpongeBob,41," A customer ordered a medium soda, and I gave him a large! I gave him a large! I've soiled the good Krusty Krab name! [Repeatedly screams out ""Soiled it!"" for a very long time]
",3
4425,Plankton,41," I command you to stop that. Stop that and return to your post! [Plankton pushes his hand is SpongeBob's chest, in hopes that he'll stop] Where's the off button on this thing?
",3
4426,Pearl,41," [Pearl walks up to Plankton] Okay, Daddy. I've decided I'm gonna run away! Run away and find a new daddy!
",3
4427,Plankton,41," Make it stop! [A siren horn then goes off and then everyone becomes silent, including SpongeBob] What, did I say the secret word?
",3
4428,SpongeBob,41," No sir, he's back.
",3
4429,Plankton,41," Who's back? What? [Something red flashes by] What was that?
",3
4430,SpongeBob,41," [An alarm sounds] Man your stations! Red alert! Red alert! Take cover! [All the customers scream, and run to take cover]
",3
4431,Plankton,41," [he runs in circles] Take cover from what?!
",3
4432,SpongeBob,41," [SpongeBob's up in the crow's nest searching for him] He's around here somewhere. [SpongeBob sees the red flash by once again] There he goes!
",3
4433,Plankton,41," What? Who? Where? Somebody tell me.
",3
4434,Harold,41," Some say he crawled out from the lowest trench in the ocean.
",3
4435,Pearl,41," He's the saltiest of all the sea dogs.
",3
4436,SpongeBob,41," He's the most hated creature in Bikini Bottom. [The red flash then bursts out of the kitchen and we then see it is Krabs holding a Krabby Patty while swinging on a rope]
",3
4437,Mr. Krabs,41," And he's finally got a Krabby Patty! Ar, ar, ar, ar!
",3
4438,Plankton,41," Krabs? What the barnacle is going on here?
",3
4439,SpongeBob,41," It's your arch competitor, Krabs. His goal in life is to steal a Krabby Patty and ruin our restaurant.
",3
4440,Plankton,41," That's terrible!
",3
4441,SpongeBob,41," Yeah, but the worst part is...
",3
4442,Plankton,41," [Krabs lands behind him. Shows a Dutch-angle, low-angle shot of naked Mr. Krabs and Plankton's surprise] Good grief, he's naked! [A part of Krabs then glints]
",3
4443,Mr. Krabs,41," [Swings up onto a board on a support beam above. Laughs.] Clothe me if you can, silly landlubbers!
",3
4444,SpongeBob,41," I'm gonna make you eat those words, Krabs! [The cash register spins upside down, and turns into a place where a cannon is located] No shoes, no shirt, no service! [SpongeBob shoots all the clothes out of the cannon at Mr. Krabs. All of them miss]
",3
4445,Mr. Krabs,41," Ar, ar, ar, ar, ar! [Mr. Krabs stops laughing, as he realizes that a bra has caught him] Aw, ya got me! Well, at least it's underwire. Here's your stinkin' Patty! [Mr. Krabs throws the Krabby Patty back to Plankton]
",3
4446,Plankton,41," [catches the Krabby Patty] I don't understand. Is there a gas leak in here?
",3
4447,SpongeBob,41," Knick-knack, the Patty's back! You did it, Mr. Plankton. Victory screech! [SpongeBob and all the customers start screeching]
",3
4448,Mr. Krabs,41," Enjoy your victory screech, Plankton, because someday the Krabby Patty formula will be mine!
",3
4449,SpongeBob,41," You'll never get this formula, you twisted fiend!
",3
4450,Mr. Krabs,41," Oh, but I will. Even if I have to come back tomorrow, and the next day, and the next day, and the next day, and the next day... [Mr. Krabs leaves the Krusty Krab. Plankton starts sweating] And the next day, and the next day, and the next day, and the next day...
",3
4451,SpongeBob,41," [SpongeBob hands Plankton a phone] Phone call, Mr. Plankton.
",3
4452,Mr. Krabs,41," [On the phone] And the next day, and the next day, and the next day, and the next day...
",3
4453,Plankton,41," [screams, then rips off his clothes] It's not worth it! It's just not worth it! Goodbye, everyone. I'll remember you all in therapy. [Plankton presses the button for the Switch-Lives-Just-To-Know-What-It's-Like-O-Mogrifier. He ends up back in the Chum Bucket. Holographic meatloaf is on the table] Holographic meatloaf? My favorite! [Plankton starts eating it, and is happy again]",3

4461,SpongeBob and Patrick,42," [giggling]
",3
4462,SpongeBob,42," Wey, wook. It's Widward!
",3
4463,Squidward,42," What?

4464,SpongeBob and Patrick,42," [laughs]

4468,Patrick,42," Where does he work? Wat the Wusty Wab?
",3
4469,SpongeBob and Patrick,42," [laughs]
",3
4470,Squidward,42," What's that supposed to be— some kind of stupid secret code?
",3
4471,SpongeBob,42," We can't tell you 'cause you're not a member of the club.
",3
4472,Squidward,42," Oh, yeah? What does it take to be a member, besides being a moron? [laughs] Moron... [laughs again] as a requirement. [laughs again]
",3
4473,SpongeBob,42," Sorry, Squidward, but you couldn't get in even if you tried!
",3
4474,Squidward,42," Huh? Well, I'll have you know that I am a member of over 20 different exclusive clubs all across the sea bottom!
",3
4475,Patrick,42," [whispering to SpongeBob] What did he say?
",3
4476,SpongeBob,42," [whispering to Patrick]I don't know. Something about his nose?
",3
4477,Patrick,42," [sticks his head out of the ""Club Tree"" and talks to Squidward] Squidward, you and your nose will definitely not fit in!
",3
4478,Squidward,42," Oh, what do you two zeros know about fitting in? [takes off his hat and starts to climb the ""Club Tree""] Why, you should be begging me to join!
",3
4479,SpongeBob and Patrick,42," Squidward! Squidward, no, no, no! Stop! No, no, no, stop, please, please! Stop, Squidward! You can't join! You can't join! Can't join! You can't get in!
",3
4480,Squidward,42," Well, this is stupid. There's no room up here!
",3
4481,Patrick,42," That's what we've been trying to tell you!
",3
4482,SpongeBob,42," We've been stuck up here for three days.

4483,Patrick,42," We told you you wouldn't fit in.

4484,Squidward,42," [sneers]

4485,SpongeBob,42," Well, since you're here, Squidward, we'll give you the new member initiation. Are you ready, Patrick?

4486,Patrick,42," Ready!

4488,Squidward,42," Shut your half-wit pieholes! [grabs a tree beside the tree holding up the ""Club Tree"" and pulls it while the other tree is going down] I do not now, nor will I ever, want to be a member of your stupid club! [gets to the floor but the tree snaps and the tree holding up the ""Club Tree"" flings back very fast and the ""Club Tree"" flies off it. He starts screaming]

",3
4492,Squidward,42," Oh, no. That didn't just happen. Please tell me that didn't happen!
",3
4493,Patrick,42," What happened?
",3
4494,Squidward,42," Where are we? We're lost! There's no way out! Stuck... in the middle of nowhere... with SpongeBob and Patrick!

4495,Squidward,42," Oh, why must every 11 minutes of my life be filled with misery? Why-y-y-y?!
",3
4496,SpongeBob,42," Oh, cheer up, Squid. It could be worse.
",3
4497,Patrick,42," Yeah. You could be bald and have a big nose.
",3
4498,Squidward,42," Well... this is the end. [head falls on the ground]
",3
4499,SpongeBob,42," No, it's not, Squidward.
",3
4500,Patrick,42," [building coffins] It's not?
",3
4501,SpongeBob,42," Come on, guys, we're gonna be fine! [patting Squidward's head] As long as we stick together. Remember, we're a club!
",3
4502,SpongeBob and Patrick,42," [they do the victory screech again]
",3
4503,SpongeBob,42," And besides, we have this! [pulls out a conch shell]
",3
4504,Squidward,42," What's that?
",3
4505,Patrick,42," Ohhh! The Magic Conch Shell! Ask it something! Ask it something!
",3
4506,SpongeBob,42," Magic Conch Shell, will I ever get married? [pulls the string attached to the Magic Conch]
",3
4507,Magic Conch,42," Maybe someday.
",3
4508,SpongeBob and Patrick,42," [giggling] Oooohhhh!
",3
4509,Squidward,42," You've got to be kidding! That is just a stupid toy! How can that possibly help us?
",3
4510,SpongeBob,42," [gasps] Squidward, we must never question the wisdom of the Magic Conch. The club always takes its advice before we do anything.
",3
4511,Patrick,42," The shell knows all!
",3
4512,SpongeBob,42," Oh, Magic Conch Shell, what do we need to do to get out of the Kelp Forest?
",3
4513,Magic Conch,42," Nothing.
",3
4514,Patrick,42," The shell has spoken!
",3
4515,Squidward,42," Nothing?! We can't just sit here and do nothing!
",3
4516,Squidward,42," [growls] I can't believe you two are gonna take advice from a toy!
",3
4517,Squidward,42," [growls again] All right, all right, all right! I don't need your help. I'm gonna find my way back to sanity! [starts walking away in the Kelp Forest] But don't you two sad clowns come crying to me when your circus tent comes crashing down! Sad clowns... [laughs] sad... [laughs again] clowns. [laughs again. He begins to run fast and scared while panting] What was that? I was already here! Which way do I go? Oh, I'm lost! [trips and falls] Ohh... I'm hopelessly lost! I'll never get out of here! [sees light] Huh? [laughing. He goes toward the light] I'm free! Take that, SpongeBob and Patrick! [pumps fists in the air and starts laughing triumphantly but sees SpongeBob and Patrick] Huh? Ohhh... [falls on the ground] there's no way out of here. [scene cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick still doing nothing. A stick is thrown at Patrick's head. Squidward is putting a pan over a fire] How's it going over there at Club Shell-for-Brains? Mmm-mmm-mmm. I am hungry. I wonder what's on the menu for Club Squidward tonight? [steps on a bug] Ah... [puts the bug on the pan and walks over to SpongeBob and waves the pan over his nose] Doesn't that smell good, SpongeBob? You haven't eaten in days. [walks over to Patrick] How about you, Patrick? A big boy's gotta eat. Well, you can't have any. [walks away from Patrick] And do you know why, SpongeBob? Because your club president is a shell! [shakes his butt in SpongeBob's face] If you had listened to me you'd have food, shelter, and a roaring fire. But instead you listened to a talking clam... [moves back to Club Squidward] that tells you nothing! As if the answers to solve all your problems will fall right out of the sky! [laughs] Fall right out of the sky! [camera switches to an airplane falling out of the sky]
",3
4518,Scooter,42," Dude, we're falling right out the sky! We gotta drop the load! [presses the ""Drop the Load"" button. The airplane drops picnic supplies to where SpongeBob and Patrick are]
",3
4519,SpongeBob and Patrick,42," Praise the Magic Conch! [victory screech. Squidward stares shockingly and the bug gets up and hits him with the stick. SpongeBob and Patrick eat. SpongeBob eats two hamburgers. Patrick eating a whole turkey in one bite. Now, when SpongeBob and Patrick are drinking, SpongeBob is drinking a can of soda and Patrick is drinking a bottle of ketchup. They laugh]
",3
4520,Squidward,42," Uh, hey, uh, SpongeBob... that sure is a lot of food you got there.
",3
4521,SpongeBob,42," It's a gift from the Magic Conch.
",3
4522,Squidward,42," Everything sure looks delicious. [gasps] Oh! Smoked sausages! My favorite! [smells them but Patrick sucks them in and Squidward's nose too. He pulls his nose out] Uh, hey, uh, [laughs] SpongeBob, I...you know I was just kidding around earlier and-and-and I-I-I mean I'm... I'm still part of the club, right? And... and-and-and-and-and after all, the-the club's gotta stick together, and I-I mean... you know, I-I, um... [stammers] [While he is saying all this, SpongeBob is eating a cookie and is drinking a glass of orange juice]
",3
4523,SpongeBob,42," Squidward?
",3
4524,Squidward,42," Umm...uh..yeah?
",3
4525,SpongeBob,42," Once a member, always a member!
",3
4526,SpongeBob and Patrick,42," [clink glasses] To the club! [victory screech]
",3
4527,Squidward,42," Yeah. [mimics the victory screech, weakly] Now, uh, if you'll excuse me... [runs to the table with all the food] All right... What shall I eat first? The spaghetti, the turkey, the soup, the canned meat?
",3
4528,SpongeBob,42," Why don't you ask... the Magic Conch, Squidward?
",3
4529,Squidward,42," Oh, yeah, like that'll happen. Right after I consult the Magic Toenail.
",3
4530,SpongeBob,42," [gasps] Squidward, are you questioning the authority of the Magic Conch? The conch is the one who gave us this banquet. This copyrighted conch is the cornerstone of our organization.

4531,Patrick,42," [whispering] Maybe he's not a brother.
",3
4532,Squidward,42," [chuckles] Hey, y-you guys have it all wrong. I-I love this, uh, piece of plastic. [takes the Magic Conch from SpongeBob] Uh, hello there. Magic Conch, uh, I was wondering... uh, should I have the spaghetti or the turkey?
",3
4533,Magic Conch,42," Neither.
",3
4534,Squidward,42," Oh. Then how about the soup?
",3
4535,Magic Conch,42," I don't think so.
",3
4536,Squidward,42," Could I have anything to eat?
",3
4537,Magic Conch,42," No.
",3
4538,Squidward,42," No?! What do you mean no? I'm starving here!
",3
4539,Patrick,42," [takes Magic Conch] Here, let me try. Magic Conch, could Squidward have some of this yummy, delicious, super-terrific sandwich?
",3
4540,Magic Conch,42," No.
",3
4541,Patrick,42," Hmm... Could I have this yummy, delicious, super-terrific sandwich?
",3
4542,Magic Conch,42," Yes.
",3
4543,Patrick,42," All right! [vacuums in the sandwich and burps] Sorry, Squidward.
",3
4544,Squidward,42," Give me that! [takes Magic Conch] Can I have something to eat?
",3
4545,Magic Conch,42," No.
",3
4546,Squidward,42," Can I have something to eat?
",3
4547,Magic Conch,42," No.
",3
4548,Squidward,42," Can I have something to eat?
",3
4549,Magic Conch,42," No.

4550,Squidward,42," Can't you say anything else but no?
",3
4551,Magic Conch,42," Try asking again.
",3
4552,Squidward,42," [asks politely with a grin on his face]Can I have something to eat?
",3
4553,Magic Conch,42," [in a very insulting, sarcastic-like tone] No!
",3
4554,SpongeBob,42," Squidward, are you all right?
",3
4555,Patrick,42," Maybe we should ask the shell if he's okay.
",3
4556,Kelp Forest Ranger,42," Hello? Anyone there? Hello? Hello?! [cuts through the kelp. He gasps and sees SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward dirty] Do you folks need some help?
",3
4557,Squidward,42," [gasps] I'm saved! [runs over to the forest ranger] You don't know how happy I am to see you. I have been stranded out here for weeks with-with-with these two barnacle heads and their Magic Conch Shell!
",3
4558,Kelp Forest Ranger,42," Magic... Conch Shell? [pulls out a Magic Conch Shell] You mean like this?! [says this while cross-eyed and having two big teeth]
",3
4559,SpongeBob and Patrick,42," The Magic Conch! A club member!

",3
4564,"SpongeBob, Patrick and Kelp Forest Ranger",42," Hooray for the magic conches!
",3
4565,Kelp Forest Ranger,42," All right, Magic Conch... what do we do now?
",3
4566,Magic Conch,42," Nothing.
",3
4567,"SpongeBob, Patrick, and Kelp Forest Ranger",42," All hail the Magic Conch! [they sit down doing nothing. Squidward, still dumbstruck, moves in between them]

4580,Harold,43," Thanks. [walks off and sits at his table]

4581,Squidward,43," Look at them eating that garbage. [Harold bites into his food and squirts mayonnaise into his mouth] It's disgusting. They're sickening. I hate Krabby Patties.

",3

",3
4585,Squidward,43," Yeah, well, not me.
",3
4586,SpongeBob,43," [silence, chuckles] You're good at that. [jumps on top of the window] Hey everyone! Squid says he doesn't like Krabby Patties. Ha! [everyone laughs]
",3
4587,Squidward,43," Don't encourage them! They'll never leave.
",3
4588,SpongeBob,43," [starts to grill more patties] Sorry, Squidward, it's just so funny. You know what we say. [all the customers appear in the kitchen]
",3
4589,All,43," The only people who don't like a Krabby Patty, have never tasted one! [they all disappear]
",3
4590,Squidward,43," That's me. Never had one, never will. [SpongeBob flips a Krabby Patty through the ceiling of the Krusty Krab after hearing this]
",3
4591,SpongeBob,43," What?
",3
4592,Squidward,43," What?
",3
4593,SpongeBob,43," [cleans out his ears] What? What did you say?
",3
4594,Squidward,43," I've never had a Krabby Patty and never will.
",3
4595,SpongeBob,43," I'm sorry... I don't...
",3
4596,Squidward,43," I've never had a Krabby Patty. [SpongeBob puts his glasses on and takes out a dictionary]
",3
4597,SpongeBob,43," Those words. Is it possible to use them in a sentence together like that?
",3
4598,Squidward,43," I've never had a Krabby Patty! I've never had a Krabby Patty! I've never had a Krabby Patty!
",3
4599,SpongeBob,43," [takes off his glasses and throws away the dictionary] Never had a Krabby Patty?! Well, you've got to have one right now! [runs out of the kitchen holding a Krabby Patty] No wonder you're always so miserable! Here, try this.
",3
4600,Squidward,43," [slaps the patty out of SpongeBob's hand] Get that garbage outta my face! [SpongeBob runs off and brings it back]
",3
4601,SpongeBob,43," If you try it, you'll love it!
",3
4602,Squidward,43," Try one of those radioactive sludge-balls you call food? Next, I suppose you'll want me to go square-dancing with Patrick. [pan over to Patrick dressed as a cowboy, standing next to SpongeBob]
",3
4603,SpongeBob,43," [to Patrick, whispering] Sorry, Patrick. [Patrick sighs and walks off sadly. SpongeBob tries to give Squidward the patty again] Come on, you're gonna—
",3
4604,Squidward,43," [pushes the patty away] No.
",3
4605,SpongeBob,43," Open up the tunnel, here comes the train. Choo-choo... [Squidward slaps it away]
",3
4606,Squidward,43," No!
",3
4607,SpongeBob,43," [reaches behind Squidward's ear] Whoop! What's that in your ear? [pulls out a patty]
",3
4608,Squidward,43," Quit it.
",3
4609,SpongeBob,43," Come on, open wide!
",3
4610,Squidward,43," SpongeBob, if I were trapped at the bottom of a well, for three years, with nothing to eat but that Krabby Patty, I'd eat my own legs first... [walks out from behind the counter] and not just the extra ones. [walks off as SpongeBob follows]
",3
4611,SpongeBob,43," But it's good for you!
",3
4612,Squidward,43," [turns around] G—good for you?! That thing is a heart attack on a bun!
",3
4613,SpongeBob,43," No, Squidward, I meant... good for your soul. [background turns to a heaven-like sky and SpongeBob wearing wings and a halo and doves are seen flying in the background and a choir is heard]
",3
4614,Squidward,43," Oh, puh-lease! I have no soul! [background turns to fire, and flying bats and evil laughter is heard. Squidward walks off]
",3
4615,SpongeBob,43," Okay, just half.
",3
4616,Squidward,43," No.
",3
4617,SpongeBob,43," A quarter?
",3
4618,Squidward,43," No.
",3
4619,SpongeBob,43," One bite?
",3
4620,Squidward,43," No. [Squidward enters the bathroom. When he opens a stall door, SpongeBob shows him the patty]
",3
4621,SpongeBob,43," Just smell it.
",3
4622,Squidward,43," If I didn't want it out there, what makes you think I'd find it more appealing in here?! [slams the door. Cut to Squidward washing dishes. SpongeBob rises up, made with pink bubble in the sink, holding the Krabby Patty in his hand]
",3
4623,SpongeBob,43," Come on, Squidward.
",3
4624,Squidward,43," No. [all the bubbles pop, including the Krabby Patty. Cut to Squidward putting money in the register. SpongeBob pops out of the register with coins on his head and eyes]
",3
4625,SpongeBob,43," One bite.
",3
4626,Squidward,43," No... [cash drawer shuts. Cut to Squidward taking out the trash. SpongeBob pops up from inside the trashcan, made with fruit and trash]
",3
4627,SpongeBob,43," You won't be sorry.
",3
4628,Squidward,43," [throws the garbage bag in the trash can] No! [turns around and sees SpongeBob]
",3
4629,SpongeBob,43," It's delicious...
",3
4630,Squidward,43," Listen, SpongeBob, how long are you prepared to keep this up? [SpongeBob handcuffs himself to Squidward. Squidward takes the patty] Give me that! When I die...you stay away from my funeral. [looks at the patty, patty juice falls out] Ohh... do I really...
",3
4631,SpongeBob,43," Ahhhhh... [Squidward stretches his mouth] Eeeeee.... Oooooh-oooooh-oooh... [Squidward takes a tiny bite of the Krabby Patty and smiles. SpongeBob's eyes turn into hearts]
",3
4632,Squidward,43," Why... this Krabby Patty may be the most... [suddenly angry] Horrible! Putrid! Poorly prepared! Vile! [SpongeBob's eyes turn into atomic explosions] Unappetizing! Disgusting excuse for a sandwich, that has ever been my displeasure to have slither down my throat!
",3
4633,SpongeBob,43," But—
",3
4634,Squidward,43," [throws the patty on the ground and stomps on it] And I curse this Krabby Patty, and all who enjoy them, to an early and well-deserved grave! [puts a tombstone on top of the patty with 'R.I.P.' and a picture of a patty on it] Get it?
",3
4635,SpongeBob,43," But, it doesn't make any sense. The Krabby Patty is an absolute good. Nobody is immune to its tasty charms.
",3
4636,Squidward,43," Nobody but me.
",3
4637,SpongeBob,43," Are you sure?
",3
4638,Squidward,43," Does this look unsure to you? [close-up of Squidward's wrinkly face]
",3
4639,SpongeBob,43," No.
",3
4640,Squidward,43," Good! Now go spread the word!
",3
4641,Squidward,43," [SpongeBob's eyes well up with tears as he walks back into the Krusty Krab. When he shuts the door, Squidward gasps and digs for the Krabby Patty] Come on! Come on! Come on! [holds up the Krabby Patty covered in sand] Ah... still alive! [shoves the whole thing in his mouth] Oh, soooo delicious! [cries] Oh...! All the wasted years...! [licks the ground] I gotta have more. I gotta have more! [runs to the back of the Krusty Krab and is about to open the door but doesn't] But wait! [stands by the window. His eyes float over to the side of his face looking at SpongeBob grilling] After that performance, he'd never let me live it down! I gotta sneak one. Just one, then... I'm off the stuff for good!
",3
4642,SpongeBob,43," I didn't think it was possible, but, I guess some people just don't like Krabby Patties. [flips one in the air. Squidward peaks through the window]
",3
4643,Squidward,43," Uhh, SpongeBob?
",3
4644,SpongeBob,43," Yes, Squidward?
",3
4645,Squidward,43," I need a Triple Krabby Supreme on a kelp bun, [gets more excited] with— with extra sea pickles and, and burn it to a crisp, okay?
",3
4646,SpongeBob,43," Coming right up! [flips the patties again] Listen, Squidward. I want to apologize for before. I was only trying to make you happy. [Squidward moans and groans. His pupils flip as the patty does] But I guess deep down inside, I was trying to make myself happy, but now I've learned there's room for all kinds of people in this crazy old [indistinct. Squidward licks his lips] ...and they all don't have to like the same things. [the steam from the patties forms a figure and it kisses Squidward's nose then disappears]
",3
4647,Squidward,43," Don't go...
",3
4648,SpongeBob,43," ...And while I strongly disagree with your decision, I accept it. [SpongeBob holds up the Krabby Patty. Squidward tries to take a bite but SpongeBob takes it away and Squidward's face goes into the grill] You know, it's not often I get to make one like this. I want to see the look on their face when they take that first bite. [walks off. Squidward looks up with a burnt face. SpongeBob walks out of the kitchen] Triple Krabby Supreme! Triple Krabby Supreme! Did somebody order a Triple Krabby Supreme? Huh, they must've left.
",3
4649,Squidward,43," Well, why don't you just, uh, leave it out here, in case they come back.
",3
4650,SpongeBob,43," Noooope, a patty this special should be eaten fresh, and... well... I haven't had one of these babies in over twenty minutes, so... [eats the whole patty in one bite. Squidward gasps] Well, whoever they were, they had great taste! [Squid groans and chatters then starts to cry] Ahh, they don't know what they're missing. Well, back to work! [walks back into the kitchen]
",3
4651,Squidward,43," What do I have to do? Eat one out of the garbage? [Frank with a big belly walks up to the trash can with a partially eaten Krabby Patty]
",3
4652,Frank,43," I wish I could eat this, but I'm so darn full. Oh well. [drops the patty in the garbage]
",3
4653,Squidward,43," I had to say garbage... but, okay! [runs to the garbage can. Inhales deeply and eats everything in the garbage can. When he lifts up his head, the Krabby Patty is the only thing left in the garbage. He spits out what's in his mouth and grabs the Krabby Patty. SpongeBob runs over and grabs it out of his hand]
",3
4654,SpongeBob,43," Oh no, what's this doing here?! This patty should be cremated! [runs to the furnace and throws it in and cries. Squidward walks up] I know you didn't like him, but... it means so much that you came. [runs off as Squidward starts crying. Cut to nighttime where Squidward is sitting in his chair, still crying, when there is a knock on the door. Squidward answers it and it's a giant Krabby Patty. Squidward kisses it and sighs. Cut to Squidward having dinner with the patty, marrying the patty [where Peterson talks inaudibly], having a child with the patty, and growing old with it. Dream sequence ends]
",3
4655,Squidward,43," Hmm, honey... [wakes up] What? Oh... I have got to get my hands on a Krabby Patty! And no one's gonna stop me! [runs out of his house, panting, but tiptoes past SpongeBob's house, then pants some more to the Krusty Krab, putting his face up against the door] There it is! [Zooms into the Patty Vault through the Krusty Krab kitchen window. Cut to scene where he walks up to the Patty Vault, wide-eyed, and opens the door to reveal hundreds and hundreds of Krabby Patties.]
",3
4656,Squidward,43," Holy shrimp! I don't know where to start. [picks up a patty] All that matters is that it's just you... and me... and nobody...
",3
4657,SpongeBob,43," Squidward? [Squidward's face drops] Is that you?
",3
4658,Squidward,43," [turns around] SpongeBob? Uh, uh, uh... what are you doing here? [points at SpongeBob. While pointing at him, he notices he's showing the patty in his hand and puts it behind his back again]
",3
4659,SpongeBob,43," I always come to work at 3am. This is when I count the sesame seeds. [takes off his green hat] What are you doing here?
",3
4660,Squidward,43," Uhh, I forgot my...
",3
4661,SpongeBob,43," And why is the patty vault open?
",3
4662,Squidward,43," Oh, I thought that...
",3
4663,SpongeBob,43," And why are you holding a patty behind your back?
",3
4664,Squidward,43," I... I... I... no, I didn't do...
",3
4665,SpongeBob,43," And why are you acting so nervous? And why are you sweating so much? And why do you look so hungry? And... [grins]
",3
4666,Squidward,43," No, no, wait... it's not what you think. Th-this is a big misunderstanding. You've got to believe me, I... Listen, I am telling you... [jumps up and down] You better listen to me, SpongeBob!
",3
4667,SpongeBob,43," You like Krabby Patties, don't you, Squidward? [Squidward begins to sweat then slams the door on SpongeBob]
",3
4668,Squidward,43," Yes! Yes! I admit it, SpongeBob! I love Krabby Patties! [eats two patties]
",3
4669,SpongeBob,43," I knew it all along, Squidward. No one can resist a Krabby Patty! [Squidward eats a bunch of Krabby Patties in all sorts of ways, even a dozen at a time] Squidward! How many are you eating? Squidward! [Squidward keeps eating all the Krabby Patties in the vault, Pac-Man style] Squidward, you can't eat all those patties at one time! Squidward! [As soon as he ate dozens of Krabby Patties]
",3
4670,Squidward,43," What's gonna happen? Am I gonna blow up?
",3
4671,SpongeBob,43," No, worse, it'll go right to your thighs!
",3
4672,Squidward,43," My thighs? [pan down showing Squidward's enlarged thighs, Squidward looks at thighs]
",3
4673,SpongeBob,43," ...and then you'll blow up! [Krusty Krab explodes. Squidward's head is sitting on the ambulance's bench while his legs are in a bucket]
",3
4674,Joe,43," [laughs] Yeah, I remember my first Krabby Patty.
",3
4675,Squidward,43," Hmm, honey... [wakes up] What? Oh... I have got to get my hands on a Krabby Patty! And no one's gonna stop me! [runs out of his house, panting, but tiptoes past SpongeBob's house, then pants some more to the Krusty Krab, putting his face up against the door] There it is, unguarded! All I have to do is... Wait... It's too easy. There must be some kind of... [Squidward sees dripping coming from above the door inside] security? [Squidward looks up and notices a bucket] This is our burglar alarm? A bucket of water? Ha-ha. [Squidward walks in, knocking the bucket off the door] That was too easy. [sniffs] Hey, this isn't water, this is...gas! [A robotic arm with a match drops it, lighting a screaming Squidward on fire, who runs all the way into the kitchen, where another bucket of gas falls on him and fire is seen again, as he screams again. And then he walks up to the Patty Vault, wide-eyed, and opens the door to reveal hundreds and hundreds of Krabby Patties.]

4682,Narrator,44,"  Oh, a dark and stormy night. It's nights like these that remind me of the time Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob thought they killed the health inspector. [laughs evilly. Stormy night becomes calm day] It was a bright and sunny morning. [scene cuts to the Krusty Krab where a fish drives up and stops in front of the restaurant. The scene zooms into his badge that reads 'Health Inspector']
",3
4683,Mr. Krabs,44," [Taking a bath in money] Ah...That smells like... [gasps] ...the health inspector! [Mr. Krabs runs up to SpongeBob in a yellow towel] Wash your hands, clean the floors, change your underwear! The health inspector's here! [both are peeking out the kitchen window at the health inspector, who is writing on a clipboard] If he finds one health violation, he'll close us down for good. We've got to do everything in our power to make sure he passes the Krusty Krab.
",3
4684,SpongeBob,44," But Mr. Krabs, there's no reason to worry. [eyes widen] The Krusty Krab is the most perfect place in the universe.
",3
4685,Mr. Krabs,44," You really haven't got any brains at all, have you, son? [pushes SpongeBob out the door] Just go out there and give him what he needs. Pour on the charm. Sweet talk him. [SpongeBob walks up to the health inspector, who is still writing on his clipboard at the table]

",3
4687,Mr. Krabs,44," [slaps forehead] We're doomed.
",3
4688,Health Inspector,44," I'm going to need you to bring me one of everything on the menu.
",3
4689,SpongeBob,44," [walking backwards back into the kitchen] Excellent choice, my darling. Coming right up! [SpongeBob enters the kitchen, where Krabs waits] He wants one of everything.
",3
4690,Mr. Krabs,44," Then we'll give him a smorgasbord! [holds up a tray of a patty, a drink, some fries, and coral bits] The future of the Krusty Krab is at stake! [SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs run up to the health inspector]

",3
4698,SpongeBob,44," And did the voluptuous inspector enjoy his meal?
",3
4699,Health Inspector,44," [writes on his clipboard] So far, so good. I just need to try a plain Krabby Patty and my inspection will be finished.
",3
4700,SpongeBob,44," [open kitchen door] He says if he gets one more Krabby Patty, he'll pass us for the inspection!
",3
4701,Mr. Krabs,44," [picks up SpongeBob] Do you know what this means, dear boy? We're in the clear! [both dance off then leapfrog over each other, across the screen then do the can-can in dresses until a news report comes on tv]
",3
4702,A. Realistic Fish Head,44," We interrupt this can-can for a special news bulletin. Be on the lookout for a man who's been passing himself off as a health inspector in order to obtain free food. That's all for now. [Mr. Krabs gets angry]
",3
4703,Mr. Krabs,44," Free food?!
",3
4704,SpongeBob,44," Maybe we oughta tell our guy about the phony impostor.

4711,Mr. Krabs,44," I bet his mom bought him that hat. [holds up a krabby patty] If that impostor wants a Krabby Patty, then by Neptune, we'll give him one. [flicks the top bun off and puts a some volcano sauce on the patty] You're dancin' with the crab man now! Join me, boy, or you're fired!
",3
4712,Mr. Krabs,44," Ohh, hold on, I've got a ton of toenail clippings in my office! [runs off as SpongeBob drops the patty in the toilet]
",3
4713,SpongeBob,44," Oops, I dropped it in the toilet! [Mr. Krabs runs in with a smelly sock]
",3
4714,Mr. Krabs,44," Well, fish it out, and I'll dry it with me gym socks! [scene cuts to showing a disgusting krabby patty with what appears to be pimples and green meat] Why that's the most diabolical Krabby Patty ever spawned! [both are wearing clothespins on their noses]
",3
4715,SpongeBob,44," I call it the 'Nasty Patty'. [both laugh]
",3
4716,Health Inspector,44," Hey, hurry up with that patty! [SpongeBob runs in with the patty]
",3
4717,SpongeBob,44," [speaking quickly] Here you go sir, enjoy. [runs back into the kitchen]
",3
4718,Health Inspector,44," Ah, hello, delicious. Come to papa. [a fly flies into his throat. He starts to choke]
",3
4719,Mr. Krabs,44," [listening from the kitchen] Listen, he ate it! [both look out from the kitchen window] Oh, look at him choke! [both laugh] Look at him suffer! [both keep laughing.] Did you see that, boy? Oh man, the look on his face. [Health inspector slips on some packets of condiments and bangs his head on the table. Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob are still laughing. Another TV bulletin comes on]
",3
4720,A. Realistic Fish Head,44," We interrupt your laughter at other people's expense to bring you this news flash. The fake inspector has been captured. Here is his picture. [picture is shown on the tv] If a health inspector comes to your restaurant and he's not this guy, he's real.
",3
4721,SpongeBob,44," Phew, that's a relief, eh, Mr. Krabs? I'm sure our guy will understand if we just explain the situation. Then we can all have a good laugh about it.
",3
4722,Mr. Krabs,44," [gasps] I don't think he'll be laughin', boy.
",3
4723,SpongeBob,44," Why, sir?
",3
4724,Mr. Krabs,44," Because that patty killed him! [both scream, check the inspector again, then scream again]
",3
4725,SpongeBob,44," Mr. Krabs, what are we gonna do?
",3
4726,Mr. Krabs,44," What's this ""we"" stuff? You fed him the tainted patty. Looks like it's the stony lonesome for you!
",3
4727,SpongeBob,44," But you told me to give it to him!
",3
4728,Mr. Krabs,44," Well, you could've talked me out of it!
",3
4729,SpongeBob,44," You're right, Mr. Krabs, I'm guilty. I'll never survive in prison, they'll mop up the floor with me. [Mr. Krabs grabs him]
",3
4730,Mr. Krabs,44," Get a hold of yourself, boy. We've got to get rid of this body before anyone sees it. We've got to take it out and bury it. [scene cuts to SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs on a muddy hill.]
",3
4731,Spongebob,44," [disguised] Eww, gross, germs, it's all icky and corpsy! [SpongeBob is dragging the body by a tissue and is constantly spraying it with disinfectant]
",3
4732,Mr. Krabs,44," This should be far enough. Now get diggin'! [hands SpongeBob a shovel]
",3
4733,SpongeBob,44," Yes, sir. [while digging a big hole, his shovel hits something]
",3
4734,Mr. Krabs,44," What's the holdup down there?
",3
4735,SpongeBob,44," There's a big rock in the way!
",3
4736,Mr. Krabs,44," Well toss it out and get back to diggin'!
",3
4737,SpongeBob,44," [salutes] Aye aye, sir! [tosses the huge rock behind him]
",3
4738,Health Inspector,44," Uhh, where am I? [rock hits him in the head knocking him out again]
",3
4739,Mr. Krabs,44," Somethin' ain't quite right.
",3
4740,SpongeBob,44," What do you mean, Mr. Krabs? [health inspectors head is out of the ground]
",3
4741,Mr. Krabs,44," His head's stickin' out! [SpongeBob covers his head with more sand]
",3
4742,SpongeBob,44," Sorry, Mr. Krabs. I thought he might need some air.
",3
4743,Mr. Krabs,44," They don't need air where he's going.
",3
4744,SpongeBob,44," Shouldn't we say a few words on his behalf?
",3
4745,Mr. Krabs,44," Uhh, he was a credit to health inspectors everywhere, and, uhh...
",3
4746,SpongeBob,44," [bawling] What a brave man, going in the line of duty like that! Why? Why? Why?! [Mr. Krabs grabs SpongeBob]
",3
4747,Mr. Krabs,44," Listen here, ya little barnacle. No one, and I mean no one, can ever know about this. It'll be the end of you, it'll be the end of me, and worst of all, it'll be the end of me.
",3
4748,Officer Malley,44," [shines a flashlight on them] Stop right where you are! I'm afraid we're going to have to arrest the two of you! [SpongeBob hangs on Mr. Krabs]
",3
4749,SpongeBob,44," Mr. Krabs, I'm too young to go to jail! [Mr. Krabs covers his mouth]
",3
4750,Mr. Krabs,44," And what would be the charges?
",3
4751,Officer Malley,44," For not being at the Krusty Krab to whip us up a couple of dee-licious Krabby Patties! [both police officers laugh. Mr. Krabs laughs nervously]
",3
4752,Mr. Krabs,44," Laugh, boy. [SpongeBob laughs. It rains. The rain makes the health inspector slide down the hill]
",3
4753,Officer Nancy,44," Put that muddy shovel in the trunk and we'll give you a ride back. [SpongeBob is still laughing until Mr. Krabs hits him. Mr. Krabs opens the trunk and SpongeBob puts the shovel in it]
",3
4754,Mr. Krabs,44," SpongeBob, listen carefully. We're just getting a lift back to the Krusty Krab. I need you to stay calm and don't lose your cool. Understand. [SpongeBob looks down]
",3
4755,SpongeBob,44," Can I lose my cool now?
",3
4756,Mr. Krabs,44," Why? [SpongeBob points to the health inspector, who is now down the hill. Both scream and Mr. Krabs grabs the body and gives it to SpongeBob] Put it in the trunk, boy! I'll keep them cops busy!
",3
4757,Officer Malley,44," What's the holdup back there? [Mr. Krabs starts talking to him as a distraction]
",3
4758,SpongeBob,44," Oh, Neptune, get away! [throws the inspector in the trunk then sprays himself with disinfectant. Slams the trunk on the health inspector, who was waking up] Ahem. Ok, all set back here. Nothing unusual about a muddy shovel in the trunk. [laughs nervously]
",3
4759,Mr. Krabs,44," All set! [SpongeBob slides in almost motionlessly]
",3
4760,Officer Nancy,44," You ok there, little fella?
",3
4761,Mr. Krabs,44," Oh, he gets carsick real easy.
",3
4762,Officer Malley,44," Well buckle up and we'll drive real smooth-like. [drives off]
",3
4763,Mr. Krabs,44," Now listen, SpongeBob, when we get to the Krusty Krab, I want you to take that [winks] shovel and bring it around to the back entrance and stuff...err, I mean, stow it in the freezer. Understand?
",3
4764,SpongeBob,44," I understand, Mr. Krabs, but what do you want me to do with the bo...
",3
4765,Mr. Krabs,44," [grabs SpongeBob's lips] ...ttles of soda! Bottles of soda, Same thing, put 'em in the freezer. [Nancy stares at them funny. Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob laugh. Scene cuts to the Krusty Krab where SpongeBob is bringing the body to the back]
",3
4766,SpongeBob,44," Oh man, this is so gross! [tries the handle on the door but there is a lock] The back door is locked. What am I gonna do? [scene cuts to inside the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob enters with a big hat where the health inspector is in it]
",3
4767,Mr. Krabs,44," Ahoy there, SpongeBob! I thought you were out back taking care of that shovel! [twitches & winks his eyes]
",3
4768,SpongeBob,44," Well, the back door was locked, so I came around here. [his hat sags over, and SpongeBob puts it back in position] So if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go put my hat in the freezer now. [walks to the kitchen very carefully]
",3
4769,Mr. Krabs,44," Okey dokey, SpongeBob!
",3
4770,Officer Malley,44," Is that boy ok?
",3
4771,Officer Nancy,44," He's acting a little funny.
",3
4772,Mr. Krabs,44," Funny? Oh, yeah! [laughs] He's a real cutup, that one. He knows how to keep the growing stages! Good one, boy! Always on, that one, there's no off on his funny switch! [laughs. SpongeBob is trying to get through a door but his hat is too big] Oh, look, I almost forgot, it's 'Open Cash Register' night! First two customers get all the money in the cash register! [hands out the money. SpongeBob gets his hat inside the kitchen]
",3
4773,Policeman,44," [listens to his walkie-talkie] Eighty-six those patties, Krabs. We just got a call about two ghouls burying a stiff over by Shallow Grave Road.
",3
4774,Officer Nancy,44," I want a soda. [Mr. Krabs gives her one]
",3
4775,Mr. Krabs,44," Here's your soda! Always a pleasure to serve the folks in blue. Well, goodbye now!
",3
4776,Officer Nancy,44," Hey, there's no ice!
",3
4777,Mr. Krabs,44," [nervous] Ice? Ice? You want ice? Is that what you want? You want ice? Is that what you want? [SpongeBob slides on screen]
",3
4778,SpongeBob,44," The dark deed you requested is done, sir.
",3
4779,Officer Nancy,44," [walks to the kitchen] I'll get it myself. Ice is in the freezer, right? [Mr. Krabs runs to block the freezer door]
",3
4780,Mr. Krabs,44," There is no ice! There's never been any ice. Ice is just a myth.
",3
4781,Officer Nancy,44," Step aside. You people act like you've committed a murder.
",3
4782,Mr. Krabs,44," Ok, I confess! [points to SpongeBob] SpongeBob killed him!
",3
4783,SpongeBob,44," What? You can't pin this whole rap on me!
",3
4784,Mr. Krabs,44," He was insane! Out of control! He would've killed me too if you two hadn't come along.
",3
4785,SpongeBob,44," It was all Mr. Krabs' idea.
",3
4786,Mr. Krabs,44," Put him down now! He's a mad dog!
",3
4787,SpongeBob,44," He wears curlers to bed!
",3
4788,Mr. Krabs,44," Wait! It's not what you think!
",3
4789,Officer Nancy,44," What are you two talking about?
",3
4790,Mr. Krabs,44," We killed the health inspector! Buried him and then stuffed his body in the freezer!
",3
4791,Officer Nancy,44," You mean in here? [opens the freezer but it's empty]
",3
4792,Mr. Krabs,44," It's empty?
",3
4793,Officer Nancy,44," Is this some kind of a joke?
",3
4794,Mr. Krabs,44," Yeah...a joke! [SpongeBob giggles]
",3
4795,Officer Nancy,44," Say, maybe he turned into a zombie and walked out. [everyone laughs. Just then a fish walks up moaning]
",3
4796,SpongeBob,44," [screams] It's the zombie! [the inspector turns the lights on]
",3
4797,Health Inspector,44," Hey, you guys...
",3
4798,Officer Malley,44," [hits the inspector with an anchor] Take that, you zombie! [inspector now has a huge bump on his head]
",3
4799,Officer Nancy,44," I'll take it from here. [hits the inspector with a barrel] Die, zombie!
",3
4800,Officer Malley,44," Good police work, officer Nancy. Hey, this guy's not a zombie. He's just an ordinary health inspector.
",3
4801,Health Inspector,44," Yes. And at the risk of being hit again, I'd like to present you with this. [gives Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob a note with the word 'pass' on it checked]
",3
4802,SpongeBob,44," Hey, Mr. Krabs, look. We passed the inspection!
",3
4803,Everyone,44," Hooray! [everyone walks out of the kitchen]
",3
4804,Mr. Krabs,44," Come on, everybody. Krabby Patties at half price! Well, not really.
",3
4805,Health Inspector,44," [inspector tries to crawl out] Oh boy, I'd like a Krabby Patt... [door slams in his face. Scene cuts to above water where its stormy again]

4823,Squidward,45," Whatever. Five dollars, please.
",3
4824,Mermaid Man,45," You got it, bucky. [removes his left seashell cup, opens the shell up like a clutch purse and pulls out a metal nut] Will this cover it? [close up of the nut and a timpani noise is heard]
",3
4825,Squidward,45," No.
",3
4826,Barnacle Boy,45," [confronts Squidward] Listen big nose, [points at Mermaid Man] this guy has been saving your butt since before you were born. Don't you got a living legend discount or something?
",3
4827,Squidward,45," This is a restaurant, not a lending library. And who are you calling big nose, big nose? [both press noses against each other. Barnacle Boy gets out a $5 bill from his hat and he throws it to Squidward]

4828,Barnacle Boy,45," Well next time danger threatens, don't expect any help from us!

4838,Mermaid Man,45," Wait! We'll find it with the invisible boat alarm! [he pulls it out, and makes as to press a button. A car flickers in and out of visibility thrice, making beeps as well] There she is! [they run over and jump in the car. Barnacle Boy hits the seat divider]
",3
4839,Barnacle Boy,45," Eee-Ow! [rubs his behind] I told you we shoulda' got the automatic!

4840,SpongeBob,45," Hey guys! Wait up! [slow motion. Also pulling out Mermaid Man's belt] I've got something for you...

4842,SpongeBob,45," You forgot your belt! You forgot-- [Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy drive away] Mermaid Man's secret utility belt! The emblem of submersible justice! For 65 years, this belt has helped prevent the fall of nations...and pants. I can't believe I'm actually holding it in my hands! Well, I guess I should return it. [Heads into the kitchen with the belt on] Or not! [giggles] I could just hang onto it till after work...all alone with Mermaid Man's belt. I wonder what this button does! [presses the belt, and a pickle barrel shrinks] Whoa! [grabs the shrunken barrel] The small ray! [he giggles and smiles mischievously]

4843,Squidward,45," Here's your shake, sir. [he starts to hand him the shake, but he is startled by a loud noise from the kitchen and SpongeBob's giggle. The shake lands on the guy's head, the guy punches him and leaves. There are more flashes, noises, and giggles from the kitchen. Squidward gets up and he holds his head] Grr.

4844,SpongeBob,45," [Hands a tiny krabby patty to a cockroach] There you go. Come again, sir.
",3
4845,Squidward,45," SpongeBob, what's going on in here? Huh? [SpongeBob wears a tiny hat and holds a tiny spatula, and a cockroach is eating a Krabby Patty while sitting on a shrunken dining table] Why's everything all tiny?
",3
4846,SpongeBob,45," [turns the belt around] I don't know.
",3
4847,Squidward,45," What do you got there?
",3
4848,SpongeBob,45," Nothing.

4849,Squidward,45," No, really?
",3
4850,SpongeBob,45," Nothing.

4852,SpongeBob,45," No, No!

4853,Squidward,45," [gasps] Is that Mermaid Man's belt?
",3
4854,SpongeBob,45," Yes.
",3
4855,Squidward,45," Wow! I can't believe he'd lend it to you!
",3
4856,SpongeBob,45," Me, uh, either.
",3
4857,Squidward,45," [gasps] He didn't lend it to you, did he?
",3
4858,SpongeBob,45," Please don't tell!
",3
4859,Squidward,45," You stole it?
",3
4860,SpongeBob,45," Please don't tell!
",3
4861,Squidward,45," Oh. I'm telling.
",3
4862,SpongeBob,45," Squidward, if Mermaid Man finds out, he'll kick me out of his fan club for sure! Please don't tell!
",3
4863,Squidward,45," Uh Oh! [points to the phone] There's the phone.
",3
4864,SpongeBob,45," Don't!
",3
4865,Squidward,45," I'm walking towards the phone! [slowly walks towards phone]
",3
4866,SpongeBob,45," No!
",3
4867,Squidward,45," [slowly grabs the phone] I'm getting closer to the phone!
",3
4868,SpongeBob,45," Don't!
",3
4869,Squidward,45," [holds the phone, ready to call Mermaid Man] And now, for the moment we've all been waiting for.
",3
4870,SpongeBob,45," [sobs and tears himself] I'm begging you!
",3
4871,Squidward,45," [picks up the phone] Hello. I'd like to speak to Mermaid... [SpongeBob shrinks Squidward] What the? What? [phones hits Squidward] Ow!
",3
4872,Mermaid Man,45," Hello? Hello?
",3
4873,Squidward,45," What did you do to me?
",3
4874,SpongeBob,45," I'm sorry Squidward, but you made me do it!
",3
4875,Squidward,45," SpongeBob, if you don't return me to normal size right now, you are gonna be in really big trouble!
",3
4876,SpongeBob,45," Uh... uh, okay, uh...
",3
4877,Squidward,45," I said now!
",3
4878,SpongeBob,45," Uh... [belt is shown with many buttons to it] Uh...
",3
4879,Squidward,45," Do you hear me?! [SpongeBob changes Squidward into a multi-eyed Squidward with hissing snakes] Holy fish paste! Get it off me! Get it off me! [takes eyes off him and pants in fear] Don't you know how to work that thing?
",3
4880,SpongeBob,45," Uhh, I can do it! [SpongeBob changes Squidward into a burning mess, then changes him to have an enormous nose, then to have no skin, then cut in half by scissors, then changed into more things off screen while SpongeBob looks in fright. Squidward screams whenever SpongeBob changes him]
",3
4881,Squidward,45," [looks burnt after Sponge's failed attempts to revert him] Stop! I've got an idea. Let's call Mermaid Man and-
",3
4882,SpongeBob,45," [snatching Squidward] No! I can't let you do that! But there must be someone else who can help! Someone smart and wise, with years of life experience. [he runs to Patrick's house, where Patrick is sleeping] Patrick! Patrick! Patrick! Patrick!
",3
4883,Patrick,45," [wakes up due to surprise] Ehh? Huh? Oh. Hi SpongeBob.
",3
4884,SpongeBob,45," Patrick, I was at work and Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy came, and I got this belt, and look. [shows Patrick the shrunken Squidward]
",3
4885,Patrick,45," A Squidward action figure! [grabs Squidward] Let me play with him!
",3
4886,SpongeBob,45," No, Patrick!
",3
4887,Patrick,45," Fighter pilot! [imitates jet plane diving, machine gunfire and explosion noises] Dive bomb!
",3
4888,SpongeBob,45," Patrick!
",3
4889,Patrick,45," [about to punch Squidward] And then comes a giant fist!
",3
4890,SpongeBob,45," Patrick, no! That's not an action figure! That's the real Squidward! I shrunk him by accident.
",3
4891,Patrick,45," Oh... [about to punch Squidward anyway] and then comes a giant fist! [Squidward screams]
",3
4892,SpongeBob,45," [stops Patrick] Pat, you don't understand! This is serious! I don't know how to unshrink him! He could be stuck like this for the rest of his life.
",3
4893,Patrick,45," Oh, don't worry about it. He'll find love one day.
",3
4894,SpongeBob,45," You think so?
",3
4895,Patrick,45," Well, sure. But it'll be with someone his own size. [pulls out a pickle] Like this pickle! See? They like each other!
",3
4896,Squidward,45," N-n-n-n-no. [Patrick bangs them together as if to kiss. Squidward is disgusted]
",3
4897,SpongeBob,45," Oh, if only I knew how to work this thing!
",3
4898,Patrick,45," Let me take a look at it. Hmmm. You know what the problem is?
",3
4899,SpongeBob,45," What?
",3
4900,Patrick,45," You got it set to [points to the M] 'M' for Mini when it should be set to [turns M around] 'W' for Wumbo.
",3
4901,SpongeBob,45," Patrick, I don't think Wumbo is a real word.
",3
4902,Patrick,45," Come on! You know... I wumbo, You wumbo, He she me...wumbo? Wumbo, wumboing, we'll have the wumbo, Wumborama... Wumbology, the study of wumbo? It's first grade, SpongeBob!
",3
4903,Squidward,45," [while Patrick is saying ""we'll have the wumbo""] I wonder if a fall from this height could be enough to kill me.
",3
4904,SpongeBob,45," Patrick, I'm sorry I doubted you.
",3
4905,Patrick,45," Well alright then. Let 'er rip! [SpongeBob uses Mermaidman's belt and presses something to try and ""regrow"" Squidward. Only Patrick and Squidward are both shrunk now] It worked!
",3

",3
4908,SpongeBob,45," Patrick, I'm not giant, you shrunk too!
",3
4909,Patrick,45," You're kidding! [pulls out his pickle] Good thing I still got this pickle! [kisses the pickle three times. Pan over to Squidward]
",3
4910,Squidward,45," Hey! Now will you take us to Mermaid Man?!
",3
4911,SpongeBob,45," [yells at Squidward] No! He can never find out! But I'll think of something. I promise. Until then, [gets a jar and puts them in] you'll be safe in this jar.
",3
4912,Patrick,45," You know what's funny? My pickle started out in a jar, and now it's in one again! Heh. It's like a pun or something. Heheh.
",3
4913,SpongeBob,45," It's only two people no big deal, nobody else saw it. [Sandy suddenly appears]
",3
4914,Sandy,45," Howdy, SpongeBob!

4915,SpongeBob,45," [screams] Sandy! [shrinks Sandy]
",3
4916,Sandy,45," [lands on the ground] What did you? For cryin' out. What did y'all do to me?
",3
4917,SpongeBob,45," I'm sorry Sandy! Mermaid Man came in and... [Larry appears]

4918,Larry,45," Hey SpongeBob! [shrinks Larry]
",3

4920,Nancy Suzy Fish,45," Hi, SpongeBob. [shrinks Nancy. SpongeBob screams and makes a run for it]

4926,Fish #4,45," What's up, Sponge? [shrinks fish]
",3
4927,SpongeBob,45," [tries to fit everyone in the jar] Whoo! I'm gonna have to get a bigger jar.
",3
4928,Squidward,45," SpongeBob, will you just face facts? You've shrunken everybody in Bikini Bottom! You've got to go to Mermaid Man!
",3
4929,SpongeBob,45," Oh Squidward, he'll be so disappointed.
",3
4930,Sandy,45," Well, you can't leave us small forever!
",3
4931,SpongeBob,45," You don't understand! [SpongeBob's mother is seen in jar]
",3
4932,Mrs. SquarePants,45," [gently and soothingly] SpongeBob. You need to admit your mistakes.
",3
4933,SpongeBob,45," Mom?
",3
4934,Mermaid Man,45," Your mother's right, son. Mermaid Man will understand.
",3
4935,Barnacle Boy,45," You're Mermaid Man, you old coot!
",3
4936,Mermaid Man,45," Oh yeah.
",3
4937,SpongeBob,45," Mermaid Man? I'm so sorry, it's just that I'm such a big fan, and your belt, and...
",3
4938,Mermaid Man,45," [comforting SpongeBob] Awww, don't worry son. I understand! [SpongeBob smiles, with tears still pooling in his eyes] Why, I remember back when I first used the belt, the year was nineteen aught eleventeen twelve, why I believe the president.
",3
4939,Everyone,45," Just tell him how to unshrink us!
",3
4940,Mermaid Man,45," Oh, yes. The unshrink ray. Let's see, uh, uh-- Did you set it to Wumbo?
",3
4941,Everyone,45," WHAT!!!!! [the jar rumbles from anger and everyone flies out of the jar, spells out and form GET SPONGEBOB!] Get SpongeBob! [climbs up SpongeBob's body and into the holes in his head]
",3
4942,Squidward,45," Now I have to drive five miles to go to the bathroom....in my own home! [kicks SpongeBob's stomach]
",3
4943,Sandy,45," And I need an elevator to climb one stair! HI-YA! [punches his brain]
",3
4944,Mermaid Man,45," We've been shrinking for years!
",3
4945,Barnacle Boy,45," But this is ridiculous! [both kick his eyeballs. Dale kicks his pelvis, Nancy chops off one of his lungs while hanging on to his spine, Larry kicks his knee. SpongeBob is shown getting hurt from the outside]
",3
4946,Everyone,45," Everything's too big!
",3
4947,SpongeBob,45," I've got it! [Squidward saws a blood vein and Frank tries to break a bone, but stop when Sponge shrinks the city] Ta-da! [everyone looks outside through his holes] Since I couldn't make you big, I made the city small! [everybody leaves SpongeBob's body] And now, only one more thing to shrink. Cheese! [turns shrink ray into W and towards him like a camera and shrinks himself]
",3
4948,Squidward,45," I guess this is okay.
",3
4949,Larry,45," Yeah, what's the difference?
",3
4950,Nancy,45," Good idea, SpongeBob. [everyone cheers, balloons and other party items are flying, as a bus comes back and Plankton gets off of it]
",3
4951,Plankton,45," Well, it's great to be back! [notices small Bikini Bottom] Huh?",3

[scene fades to a block of ice falling into the water] This frozen giant, normally found floating in polar regions, can sometimes [Bikini Bottom Atoll is show.] stray into warmer waters, causing dramatic changes in climate [An iceberg floats next to the island. The scene changes to show a wide shot of Bikini Bottom. Snow is shown falling.] for tropical, undersea life.
",3
4959,Johnny Elaine,46," Yes, it seems Old Man Winter paid us a visit late last night, and he brought with him not a pillow or a sheet, [A street in downtown Bikini Bottom is shown.] but a blanket... a blanket of snow! [Jellyfish Fields and its sign are shown covered in snow.] Yes, from Jellyfish Fields... [A jellyfish floats by. The scene changes to show Mr. Krabs' house.] to residential abodes... [The scene changes to show a traffic light changing from ""go"" to ""stop"" then back to ""go.""] to bustling downtown... [SpongeBob's pineapple is shown.] it's nothing but the white stuff.

",3
4964,Patrick,46," Snow angel! [laughs while on the ground flapping his arms and legs. He stands up. He looks behind him to see a circle.] Oh... [a snowball hits him in the side of the head] Hey! [SpongeBob whistles] Thanks a lot, SpongeBob! While you were just standing there whistling, someone threw a snowball at me!
",3
4965,SpongeBob,46," Oh, really, Patrick? [giggles] Did the snowball look like this? [Throws another snowball. This one hitting Patrick's eyes]
",3
4966,Patrick,46," Yeah. [SpongeBob laughs. Patrick runs over to SpongeBob] This is serious, SpongeBob. Someone's after me. I think I better leave town.
",3
4967,SpongeBob,46," Patrick, I threw it. We're having a snowball fight. Don't you get it?
",3
4968,Patrick,46," Snowball fight? I want to play! I want to play!
",3
4969,SpongeBob,46," Well, first, you have to make a snowball.
",3
4970,Patrick,46," Oh, yeah. A snowball. [bends down and starts making a snowball] Oh, this is gonna be great! [shows his snowball but it's a cube] Huh? [tries making another snowball but it's a rectangular pyramid] Wha...? [tries making another snowball but it's DNA] Aw...! SpongeBob, could you help me make a snowball?
",3
4971,SpongeBob,46," Sure, pal. [makes a snowball and hands it to Patrick]

4972,Patrick,46," Thanks, buddy. [throws it at SpongeBob]

4973,SpongeBob,46," Patrick! How could you?
",3
4974,Patrick,46," It's a snowball fight, remember?
",3
4975,SpongeBob,46," Oh yeah. [they stare at each other then run back to their forts they made out of snow. They start to throw lots of snowballs at each other. Scene pans up then cuts to inside of Squidward's house where Squidward is sitting by the fire with slippers on each tentacle]
",3
4976,Squidward,46," Ah, yes. Warm fire, cozy slippers, and a piping hot cup of tea with a lemon wedge. [he picks up the lemon wedge, then squirts lemon juice in his eye, which is now twitching] Why do I even bother? [Banging is heard outside. He looks outside to see SpongeBob and Patrick building snow forts as we hear construction noises] Would you two please keep it down?!
",3
4977,SpongeBob,46," Squidward! You're just in time to enlist in my army! Join me, and together we'll defeat the Pink Menace!
",3
4978,Patrick,46," That's me!
",3
4979,SpongeBob,46," I can start you off as a buck private, but with hard work, perhaps you can rise through the ranks and become a regular private!
",3
4980,Squidward,46," Thanks, but no, thanks, Major Stupidity. You and General Nonsense over there will have to fight without me. [snickers] Got 'em Both. [notices a snowball flying at him, so he ducks. The snowball puts out his fire] Grrrrrrrr! [Squidward closes his window]
",3
4981,SpongeBob,46," Patrick, you fool! This was over before it started! I will now consider your unconditional surren-... [a snowball hits him in the face, sending him into the snow. He then drowns in it] ...-der. [Patrick laughs hysterically] So that's how he wants it to go down. [takes off his Santa hat, revealing a funnel under it. Scoops up snow in the funnel and puts it on his head. He jumps up on his fort, takes a deep breath, and starts shooting snowballs at Patrick very fast]
",3
4982,Patrick,46," Huh? [as snowballs pile on him. He then stands up, revealing a bunch of snowballs lined up on his forehead] Ha! You missed me! [SpongeBob shoots more snow into Patrick's mouth. Slow motion occurs then resumes to normal speed. Patrick swallows the snowballs and blows out cold breath. A gun cocks and SpongeBob fires more snowballs and this time the snowballs get stuck in his mouth]
",3
4983,SpongeBob,46," Score one for the boys back home! [Patrick walks up to Squidward's house and knocks on his door]
",3
4984,Squidward,46," Yes? Oh, Patrick. [Patrick is still choking] What an unpleasant surprise. Oh, boy, nothing like a game of charades. [Patrick swallows the snowballs]
",3
4985,Patrick,46," [in one breath] I was trying to tell you that I was choking on snow, but the snow melted and turned into water, and I drank all the water, now I'm better.
",3
4986,Squidward,46," Fascinating. [he slams the door] Now, where was I? [Patrick knocks on the door again] What?
",3
4987,Patrick,46," [dancing around] Can I use your bathroom?
",3
4988,Squidward,46," Patrick, go use your own bathroom.

",3
4998,SpongeBob,46," Aha! Aiding the enemy! I've caught you red-handed, Squidward!
",3
4999,Squidward,46," Look, SpongeBob, I was just... [SpongeBob throws a snowball at Squidward but he ducks and it lands in his fire again, putting it out] SpongeBob! Oh... [picks up a snowball. SpongeBob shrieks]
",3
5000,Patrick,46," Yay! Squidward's on my side!
",3
5001,Squidward,46," I most certainly am not!
",3
5002,SpongeBob,46," Then that means he's on my side!
",3
5003,Squidward,46," No, SpongeBob, I'm not on your side either. I'm on nobody's side. Snowball fights are for immature children and I will not stoop to your level. [drops the snowball] If you two want to knock each other's brains out with snowballs, kindly leave me out of it. [walks back inside and slams the door]
",3
5004,Patrick,46," Come on, SpongeBob, let's go knock each other's brains out!
",3
5005,SpongeBob,46," I'm ready!
",3
5006,Squidward,46," Hmm... [imagines Patrick throwing a snowball at SpongeBob, knocking his brain out]
",3
5007,SpongeBob,46," Okay, Patrick, it's out.
",3
5008,Squidward,46," [snickers] Now there's something I'd actually like to see! [takes a chair up to one of his windows] Nothing wrong with getting a front-row seat, I suppose. [snickers] Ahh. What's this? [SpongeBob and Patrick are shaking hands] Wha... I... no! [walks back outside] What are you doing? You're supposed to be knocking each other's brains out!
",3
5009,SpongeBob,46," We signed a peace treaty, Squidward. [Patrick shows treaty] You were right, fighting is for children.
",3
5010,Squidward,46," No, no, no, I misled you, it's for adults too! Give me that peace treaty! [rips the treaty into pieces] There! Let the war continue!
",3
5011,SpongeBob,46," Squidward, that wasn't the peace treaty. That was a copy of the peace treaty.
",3
5012,Squidward,46," Look, you two are giving up too easily. Now, Patrick, pretend I'm SpongeBob.
",3
5013,Patrick,46," And who am I?
",3
5014,Squidward,46," You're Patrick.
",3
5015,SpongeBob,46," Can I be Mr. Krabs?
",3
5016,Squidward,46," No! Wait, why?
",3
5017,SpongeBob,46," He's a good leader.
",3
5018,Squidward,46," Would you butt out?!
",3
5019,Patrick,46," Hey, you can't talk to Mr. Krabs like that, Squidward!
",3
5020,Squidward,46," I'm SpongeBob! You're Patrick! [Squidward throws a snowball at Patrick's eyes] Now, what are you going to do? [Patrick throws it back at Squidward hitting his eyes] Patrick, why didn't you hit SpongeBob?
",3
5021,Patrick,46," You said you were SpongeBob, SpongeBob.
",3
5022,SpongeBob,46," [imitating Mr. Krabs] Argh! It's true, Mr. Squidward! Now get back to work! [laughs in his regular voice]
",3
5023,Squidward,46," [silently] Oh, boy. All right, I can see where this is going. Let's just say for all intents and purposes that I, Squidward, am now part in this war. Now...
",3
5024,SpongeBob,46," If you're in this war, then where's your fort?
",3
5025,Squidward,46," I don't have one, okay? Now...
",3
5026,Patrick,46," You got to have a fort, Squidward.
",3
5027,SpongeBob,46," Forts win wars, Squidward.
",3
5028,Squidward,46," [growls] Okay, fine? You want a fort? [makes a small snow fort] There. There's your fort! Now...
",3
5029,Patrick,46," That fort's too small, Squidward.
",3
5030,Squidward,46," It's okay, Patrick. It's just a demonstration. Now...
",3
5031,SpongeBob,46," He's right, Squidward. That thing would never protect you. It's downright puny.
",3
5032,Squidward,46," Trust me, it's fine. [Patrick throws a snowball at Squidward. He wipes the snow off his face]
",3
5033,SpongeBob,46," See, it is too small.
",3
5034,Squidward,46," Not if I crouch down. I mean, you didn't even give me a chance to crouch down. [crouches down] See? Down here, I am perfectly... [Patrick throws a snowball at Squidward]
",3
5035,SpongeBob,46," Exposed.
",3
5036,Squidward,46," Would you two please... [Patrick throws a snowball at Squidward] ...stop throwing... [Patrick throws another snowball at Squidward] ...snowballs?! [Patrick pauses and throws another snowball at Squidward. Squidward growls and retaliates with a snowball of his own but it puts out his fireplace yet again]
",3
5037,SpongeBob,46," [gasps] Squidward returned fire!
",3
5038,Patrick,46," Then it's war!
",3
5039,Squidward,46," No-no... no, wait, wait, wait! [crouches down behind his snow fort] I was just giving a demonstration! [SpongeBob and Patrick throw lots of snowballs at Squidward. Squidward ends up looking like a snowman from all the snowballs that hit him. A hat then falls on his head. He then growls and breaks out of the snowman] All right, that's it! You guys asked for it! [throws a snowball at SpongeBob] I got him! Ha! I got him! [laughs] In your face, SpongeBob! [laughs] This was actually kind of... exciting! Why... I've never felt so alive!
",3
5040,Patrick,46," [laughs] He got you good, SpongeBob! [Squidward throws a snowball at Patrick and then throws lots of snowballs at SpongeBob and Patrick] Take cover! [they crouch down as Squidward continues to throw snowballs]
",3
5041,Squidward,46," [as he throws snowballs and laughs] Take that... I got you... Yeah... oh, I got you... oh, take that... Whoa, I got you that time... Oh yeah... [he starts to throw snowballs rapidly] Incoming! [SpongeBob peeps up and Patrick approaches him, showing his belly button frozen]
",3
5042,Patrick,46," Hey, SpongeBob?
",3
5043,SpongeBob,46," Yes, Patrick?
",3
5044,Patrick,46," I think Squidward's taking this really seriously. [Squidward's clarinet is wedged in Patrick's forehead] That last one had his clarinet in it.
",3
5045,SpongeBob,46," Hmm... looks like it's time for Plan B. [they both tiptoe away while Squidward continues to throw snowballs. He eventually stops and pants]
",3
5046,Squidward,46," What's going on? The snowballs have stopped falling. I better take advantage of this momentary cease-fire. [notices his fort is a little lopsided and gasps] What? My left flank is exposed? That bloated starfish is gonna run right through me! [grabs more snow and pats it down] I'll just fix that right now. [laughs] Wait, that makes my north wall a weak spot! Here we go! Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. [grabs more snow and pats some more on the north side] Oh, oh, oh! But if they attack from the rear, I'm a goner! [he pats snow on the back of the fort] There... Ha-ha! [gasps] But what about the possibility of an aerial attack! [starts digging more snow on his fort. Scene cuts to a few seconds later where Squidward has a gigantic fort, near the top of the tree] I guess that ought to do it! [laughs wildly] Fort Squidward is now all but impenetrable! [laughs more] Now, where are those fools? [snow falls on Squidward's head] Ha! The first shot has been fired! [throws a snowball while more snow falls on his head] Take this, Patrick! [throws another snowball as more snow falls on Squidward] Taste my frozen fury! [throws two snowballs. Zooms out to show the snow from a tree is falling on Squidward's head] Victory is mine! [laughs wildly] Whee! Ha-ha! Well, I got you now! [Squidward keeps throwing snowballs while SpongeBob and Patrick are watching TV and sipping some cocoa]

5099,Mr. Krabs,47," We start with a fresh patty, grilled and juicy. Add some crisp undersea veggies and cheese. Topped off with secret sauce and some buns. Voila! A Krabby Patty.
",3
5100,Amy,47," I want a Krabby Patty.
",3
5101,Jen,47," Me, too.
",3
5102,Mr. Krabs,47," How do you like them Krabby Patties, girls? [laughs]
",3
5103,Amy & Jen,47," [thumbs up. Mr. Krabs still laughing]
",3
5104,SpongeBob,47," Look, Gary, there I am again. Look!
",3
5105,Mr. Krabs,47," Two more satisfied customers. So why don't you come on in, and have yourself a Krabby Patty today.
",3
5106,SpongeBob,47," That was the best 60 seconds of my life! Well, time for bed.
",3
5107,SpongeBob,47," Time to go do my favorite thing at my favorite place. [humming]
",3
5108,Old Man Jenkins,47," Hey, you!
",3
5109,SpongeBob,47," Top of the morning, oldster.
",3
5110,Old Man Jenkins,47," Hey! I saw you on TV last night. [Then a flashback shows that Old Man Jenkins was actually watching a bran flakes commercial and saw the yellow box]
",3
5111,Announcer,47," New, Bran Flakes. Bold, new taste. Bran Flakes.
",3
5112,SpongeBob,47," You did?
",3
5113,Old Man Jenkins,47," Yeah. You were on a commercial.
",3
5114,SpongeBob,47," You're right! Wow, he recognized me.
",3
5115,Old Man Jenkins,47," Yup. See ya later, Bran Flakes. What a nice cereal box.
",3
5116,SpongeBob,47," [talking to self] ""Weren't you that guy on TV?"" Yes! I am that guy. [laughs] How kind of you to notice. Weren't you that guy on the television last night? Yes, that was me. I... [runs into Peterson]
",3
5117,SpongeBob,47," Oh, please excuse me, sir.
",3
5118,Peterson,47," Oh, that's quite all right, uhh, SpongeBob.
",3
5119,SpongeBob,47," Wow. I'm getting recognized all over. Why, next thing you'll know, people are going to start doing things like holding doors open for... [gasps] Why, sir, I'm flattered.
",3
5120,Peterson,47," Really? I don't smell anything.
",3
5121,SpongeBob,47," [laughs] You're on your way.
",3
5122,Fred,47," Excuse me, sir, can I get a napkin?
",3
5123,SpongeBob,47," Why, of course, good sir. And next time, feel free to approach me. It most be so degrading to ask across the room. And who am I making this bad boy out to?
",3
5124,Fred,47," To my tail fin. I'll get it myself.
",3
5125,SpongeBob,47," F-I-N. There we are, darling. Hmph. Looks like shyness got the best of him.
",3
5126,Squidward,47," There you are, SpongeBob. I need you to...
",3
5127,SpongeBob,47," No problem, Squidward. I got one already made out. Enjoy.
",3
5128,Squidward,47," [holding a napkin reading, ""To my tailfin; Love, SpongeBob] To my tailfin? [checks to see if he has one]
",3
5129,SpongeBob,47," Yes, I am that guy on TV.
",3
5130,Tyler,47," Hey, look!
",3
5131,SpongeBob,47," Please, good people, no photos at work.
",3
5132,Tyler,47," Here's the ketchup.
",3
5133,SpongeBob,47," Well, maybe just one. [poses] Another one? Okay. Limbo. And now, the, uh, oh, I got it.
",3
5134,Mr. Krabs,47," There you are, SpongeBob.
",3
5135,SpongeBob,47," Yes, pilot.
",3
5136,Mr. Krabs,47," I need you to... [gets hit with mop] ...OW! [finger breaks] Alright, boy. Get in there and scrub the head and stop acting so predictable.
",3
5137,SpongeBob,47," I'm so misunderstood. Alas, good people, even the brightest of stars grow weary, and I am no exception. But I will shine again after a quick break in my quarters. Stay beautiful. [we cut to Dale and Lou in the restroom]
",3
5138,Dale,47," Hey, were you able to catch Glenn the Pinkfish on Flounderman last night?
",3
5139,Lou,47," No. How was he?
",3
5140,Dale,47," Well, I knew that this guy's acting was good, but his singing was phenomenal. I'm telling you, Vendor, if that guy was to cut a solo record, he'd be a hit. [both close bathroom doors]
",3
5141,SpongeBob,47," [pupils change into stars] Solo record!
",3
5142,Mr. Krabs,47," So, if I fire him and make his successor do twice the work, and... [knock on door] ...eh, come in. [in walks SpongeBob and poses like a model] Oh, it's just you, SpongeBob. Those heads better be beautiful.
",3
5143,SpongeBob,47," They are, Mr. Krabs, and so is mine. And now I gotta lay something on ya, Krabs Baby.
",3
5144,Mr. Krabs,47," The only thing you better lay is some patties on the grill, Fry Boy.
",3
5145,SpongeBob,47," Nah, I can't take that gig, Krabber. That phase in my career is over. I'm an entertainer now.
",3
5146,Mr. Krabs,47," What in blazes are you talking about?
",3
5147,SpongeBob,47," Come on, Krabs. Let's think outside the box for a second. Commercials are old-hat. The people want music. If I could change fate I would, Krabsy. And I'm an entertainer deep down. A people's person. We're on the same page here, aren't we?
",3
5148,Mr. Krabs,47," Boy, those Krabby fumes must've gotten to your head. Borrow Squidward's gas mask and get right back to work.
",3
5149,SpongeBob,47," [snaps fingers twice] I knew you'd understand. Well, thanks for the start. I'm out of here. [SpongeBob snaps his fingers outside his office]
",3
5150,Mr. Krabs,47," Oooooh... I've never felt such a strange combination of pity... and indigestion.
",3
5151,Bill,47," There he is! Hey! We've been waiting for you. [SpongeBob makes an O-shaped mouth wiggling]
",3
5152,Nazz,47," Where have you been?
",3
5153,Bill,47," How long are you going to keep us standing here?
",3
5154,Squidward,47," Well, SpongeBob? Are you just going to stand there like a half-wit, mouth agape? Or are you going to fill these peoples' orders?
",3
5155,SpongeBob,47," Pipe down, Squidward. This crowd looks angry. They're not going to wait any longer. I think I better give them what they need, and fast.
",3
5156,Squidward,47," I think so, too, or Krabs will fire both of us. [smiling] On second thought, keep 'em waiting.
",3
5157,SpongeBob,47," No can do, Squidward. These people demand entertainment.
",3
5158,Squidward,47," Enter-what?
",3
5159,SpongeBob,47," How you doing, folks?
",3
5160,All,47," Hungry!
",3
5161,SpongeBob,47," That's no problem, ladies and germs. 'Cause SpongeBob is here to satisfy. [turns down light's dimness]
",3
5162,Squidward,47," Hey!
",3
5163,Bill,47," Eating here was your idea!
",3
5164,SpongeBob,47," I'd like to call this little number ""Striped Sweater."" ♪The best time to wear a striped sweater is all the time. One with a collar, turtleneck, that's the kind [screeching] 'Cause when you're wearing that one... special... sweater...♪ [light turns back on; all yelling] Squidward, this crowd is insatiable.
",3
5165,Squidward,47," Then why don't you back in the kitchen and grab some patties and give them what they came here for!
",3
5166,SpongeBob,47," Juggling! Thanks, Squiddy. [crowd booing]
",3
5167,Nancy,47," Is this some kind of joke?
",3
5168,SpongeBob,47," They want juggling and jokes at the same time? Tough crowd.
",3
5169,Bill,47," Oh, now what's he doing?
",3
5170,SpongeBob,47," Uhh, what do you call a vampire whose car breaks down 3 miles from a blood bank? A cab!
",3
5171,Bill,47," We're losing our appetites!
",3
5172,SpongeBob,47," Uh, okay. There's a nun, an astronaut, and a hairdryer.
",3
5173,All,47," We want patties!
",3
5174,SpongeBob,47," Well, the most I can juggle is three, but the show must go on. Whoa! [SpongeBob slips and patties flip in the air]
",3
5175,All,47," Boo!
",3
5176,SpongeBob,47," No! [talking in his head] My career is over. All those years clawing my way up. All the people I've stepped on. Wasted. [patties land on the grill]
",3
5177,Bill,47," Hey! Finally!
",3
5178,Nancy,47," That's what we've been waiting for.
",3
5179,SpongeBob,47," They seem to like it when I put this patty on the grill. I may be able to save this act, yet. Roll with it, SpongeBob. Roll with it. There's more where that came from, folks. [SpongeBob puts a whole ton of patties on the grill]
",3
5180,All,47," Yay!
",3
5181,SpongeBob,47," You like that?
",3
5182,Bill,47," It's what we wanted all along.
",3
5183,SpongeBob,47," [thinking] It seems to be working. But how do I follow it up? Buns! [speaking] It's a stretch, but we've all got to push the envelope, sometime. Okay, folks. How do you like this? [Flips patties inside buns]
",3
5184,All,47," Yeah!
",3
5185,SpongeBob,47," I'm breaking new ground. Time to get edgy.
",3
5186,Customers,47," We want onions! Cheese! Yeah!
",3
5187,SpongeBob,47," Ready for the grand finale? [splatting]
",3
5188,All,47," Whoopee! Krabby Patties!
",3
5189,Mr. Krabs,47," Well, SpongeBob, looks like you've finally found your calling.
",3
5190,SpongeBob,47, I'll say. I'm so glad I gave up fry cooking for this.,3

5197,Narrator,48," Ah, Goo Lagoon, a luxurious oasis of sand and sea. [scene cuts to SpongeBob and Sandy next to a tall tent]
",3
5198,Sandy,48," Shee-oot, SpongeBob. How are we gonna go swimmin' when you're in a shirt and tie?
",3
5199,SpongeBob,48," Ah, yes. How foolish of me. [cackles] Allow me to remedy said situation right now. I will just use this changing tent here to change into my bathing suit. [goes into the tent then pokes his head out] And I won't do anything else. [goes back in]
",3
5200,Sandy,48," SpongeBob's actin' jumpier than a rattlesnake in a pickle barrel. Wait... what?
",3
5201,SpongeBob,48," [laughs] Oh, I'll be changing alright, but not into a bathing suit. Wait until Sandy sees that I brought my karate gear! Hi-yah! [puts on his head gear that was in the bag] Hi-yah! [puts on his karate gloves that was in the bag] Sandy won't beat me this time, because I've got the elements on my side. The elements of surprise. Hi-yah! [kicks the bag]
",3
5202,Sandy,48," SpongeBob, are you ready?
",3
5203,SpongeBob,48," Yes, Sandy, I most certainly am ready! [softly] Ready to get it on. [jumps out of the tent towards Sandy] Hi...
",3
5204,Sandy,48," Hi-yah! [kicks SpongeBob in his mouth] Look, SpongeBob, we both brought our karate gear.
",3
5205,SpongeBob,48," [muffled laughter] Great minds think alike, I suppose.
",3
5206,Sandy,48," Hi-yah! [karate chops him into the air. SpongeBob crashes into the ground, followed by his pants, socks, and shoes. He stands up with the clothing on his head and feet in some food]
",3
5207,SpongeBob,48," I may be down, but I'm not out! [looks down at his feet, which are in some potato salad at a family picnic]
",3
5208,Tom,48," Way to go, buddy. It took us three days to make that potato salad. [SpongeBob jumps away] Three days!
",3
5209,SpongeBob,48," [jumps into an empty area] Hi-yah! Sandy?
",3
5210,Sandy,48," Oh, I'm Sandy alright. [her arms come out of the ground and squish SpongeBob's face] I'm very Sandy. [kicks SpongeBob into the air] Hi-yah!
",3
5211,SpongeBob,48," Oh, I get it. She's ""Sandy."" That's her name; she's also covered in... yes! [flies out of the water then back into it. Scene cuts to Sandy talking to an ice cream vendor]
",3
5212,Sandy,48," Back in Texas, we call ice cream ""frozen cow juice"". Excuse me for a sec. Hi-yah! [slaps SpongeBob in the face with her karate glove] Thank you.
",3
5213,Ice Cream Vendor,48," No, no, thank you.
",3
5214,Sandy,48," Hi-yah! [slaps SpongeBob again, sending him into the air and flying into a strong fish that is waiting in line]
",3
5215,Fish #1,48," [growls] Who threw that piece of paper at me? [SpongeBob stammers and whistles]
",3
5216,Sandy,48," Hey, what's everybody waitin' in line for?
",3
5217,Fish #1,48," Ahoy, fair lass, it be the line to get into the Salty Spitoon — [points over to an old building] the roughest, toughest sailor club ever to be built under the seven seas. Only the baddest of the bad can get in. You need to have muscles. [flexes his arm] You need to have muscles on your muscles. [flexes even more, created more muscles on his previous ones] You need to have muscles on your eyeballs! [flexes his eyes, creating muscles]
",3
5218,SpongeBob,48," Ew. [a creature is screaming, while flying out of the Salty Spitoon]
",3
5219,Sandy,48," Looks like a rip-snortin' good time, SpongeBob!
",3
5220,SpongeBob,48," Yeah, let's go in.
",3
5221,Reg,48," [lets a fish walk in] Go ahead. [line moves up] Welcome to the Salty Spitoon. How tough are ya?
",3
5222,Fish #1,48," How tough am I? How tough am I?! I had a bowl of nails for breakfast this morning!
",3
5223,Reg,48," Yeah, so?
",3
5224,Fish #1,48," Without any milk.
",3
5225,Reg,48," Uhh, right this way, sorry to keep you waiting. [fish #1 walks in. Sandy walks up to Reg] Welcome to the Salty Spitoon. How tough are ya?
",3
5226,Sandy,48," How tough am I? [rips off one of his tattoos that says ""MOM"" and puts it upside down back where it was]
",3
5227,SpongeBob,48," Wow.
",3
5228,Sandy,48," Got any more tattoos?
",3
5229,Reg,48," Uhh, that won't be necessary. Go ahead.
",3
5230,Sandy,48," Thanks. See ya inside, SpongeBob! [walks in]
",3
5231,Reg,48," How tough are ya?
",3
5232,SpongeBob,48," How tough am I? You got a new bottle of ketchup?
",3
5233,Reg,48," Sure. [hands the bottle of ketchup to SpongeBob]
",3
5234,SpongeBob,48," It's on! [strains to open it but he can't] If I could just run this under some hot water...
",3
5235,Reg,48," Get outta here. This place is too tough for you, little man.
",3
5236,SpongeBob,48," Too tough for me? That's downright ridiculous. I'll have you know I stubbed my toe last week while watering my spice garden, and I only cried for twenty minutes.
",3
5237,Reg,48," Listen, kid. I think you'd be more comfortable over at that place. [points to the building across the street]
",3
5238,SpongeBob,48," Weenie Hut Jr's? Are you saying I belong at Weenie Hut Jr's?
",3
5239,Reg,48," Oh, no, sorry, I was actually pointing at the place next to it. [points to another building]
",3
5240,SpongeBob,48," Super Weenie Hut Jr's?
",3
5241,Reg,48," Yeah. Unless you think you're tough enough to fight me. [Scene cuts to SpongeBob sitting in a seat at Weenie Hut Jr's]
",3
5242,Nerd #1,48," How's your collection coming along?
",3
5243,Nerd #2,48," Well, I don't mean to brag, but it's pretty sweet. I'm in the process of acquiring issue 347 which will give me my fourth complete set.
",3
5244,Nerd #1,48," No...
",3
5245,SpongeBob,48," [snorts] What weenies. Oh brother.
",3
5246,Robot,48," [robotic voice] Would you care for another diet cola with a lemon twist, weenie?
",3
5247,SpongeBob,48," What? But I'm not a weenie! [the robot scans SpongeBob with one of its scanners]
",3
5248,Robot,48," I'm sorry, sir, but my sensors indicate that you are indeed a weenie. [computer beeps and shows a picture of a hot dog weenie with the word ""YES"" below it]
",3
5249,SpongeBob,48," That's impossible! [runs out]
",3
5250,Robot,48," You can't hide what's inside.
",3
5251,SpongeBob,48," [runs over to Reg] I demand entrance into your club on the grounds that I am not a weenie! [a strong, orange fish walks up]
",3
5252,Tough Fish #4,48," Hey, Reg, how's it going? [SpongeBob jumps into Reg's arms and screams]
",3
5253,Reg,48," You were sayin'? [to orange fish] Go ahead, buddy.
",3
5254,Tough Fish #4,48," Thanks, Reg. [walks in]
",3
5255,SpongeBob,48," So, your name's Reg?
",3
5256,Reg,48," Would you get outta here?
",3
5257,SpongeBob,48," Mark my words, Reg. I will get into the Salty Spitoon! I will! [runs off. Scene cuts to Weenie Hut Jr's]
",3
5258,Nerd #1,48," Couldn't get in, huh? What you need is a tough hairdo. No one gets into the Double S without a tough hairdo.
",3
5259,Nerd #2,48," I disagree, I saw a guy going in there and he was bald.
",3
5260,Nerd #1,48," I saw that guy. He wasn't bald. He had a shaved head. Shaved — that's a hairdo. Case closed. [both fish notice SpongeBob is gone] Hey, where'd he go?
",3
5261,Robot,48," I believe he said something about going to the wig store.
",3
5262,Nerd #1,48," Ha-ha! Check and mate. [Someone who looks like SpongeBob walks over to Reg with a cool, black wig on]
",3
5263,Drifter,48," What's shakin', my man?
",3
5264,Reg,48," Not much. Say, haven't I seen you before?
",3
5265,Drifter,48," Doubt it — I'm a drifter — just blew into town. Heard your club was pretty tough, thought I'd check it out.
",3
5266,Reg,48," Nice try, kid. I know it's you.
",3
5267,Drifter,48," What're you talking about? [Reg pulls Drifter's hair but it is still attached to his head, it's real hair]
",3
5268,Reg,48," Aha! [the hair does not come off. SpongeBob walks up with a clown wig on]
",3
5269,SpongeBob,48," Hey, everybody, what's goin' on? [Reg tries to redo his hair but can't do it]
",3
5270,Reg,48," Ah, you can go in. Sorry about that! [cool SpongeBob walks in] What do you want?
",3
5271,SpongeBob,48," I'd like to gain entrance to your social club, please. I believe my hairdo is in order. [Reg takes the wig off SpongeBob's head. SpongeBob laughs nervously] So, uhh, where do you stand on the whole bald vs. shaved debate? [a big, green fish walks up with a tattoo of a seahorse on his right arm]
",3
5272,Tough Fish #5,48," Hey-ya, Reg.
",3
5273,Reg,48," Alright, now it's a party! Oh, yeah, check out the new ink.
",3
5274,Tough Fish #5,48," Thanks. Hey, look what I can make it do. [moves his arm, which makes the seahorse tattoo wiggle]
",3
5275,Reg,48," [chuckles] Yeah. Hey, what about that one? [big, green fish looks at his left arm that has a SpongeBob tattoo on it]
",3
5276,Tough Fish #5,48," Huh, you know, I don't remember getting this one.
",3
5277,Reg,48," Can you make it dance?
",3
5278,Tough Fish #5,48," Well, here, let me try. [moves his arm. SpongeBob dances]
",3
5279,Reg,48," Hmmm, wait a minute. [rips SpongeBob off his arm] Go ahead in. [the tattoo fish walks in, rubbing his left arm]
",3
5280,Tough Fish #5,48," Yeah, sure, Reg. Thanks.
",3
5281,Reg,48," Nice try, little man. [throws SpongeBob to the back of the line behind two strong fish]
",3
5282,Tough Fish #6,48," Hey, I was in front of you!
",3
5283,Tough Fish #7,48," No, you weren't!
",3
5284,Tough Fish #6,48," You callin' me a liar?
",3
5285,Tough Fish #7,48," I ain't callin' you for dinner! [two start fighting. SpongeBob tries to run away but the fight goes down hill, with him in it. Reg walks over]
",3
5286,Reg,48," Hold it, you two — that's enough, you're both plenty tough, go ahead in.
",3
5287,Tough Fish #6,48," Alright!
",3
5288,Tough Fish #7,48," Thanks, Reg. [both run off as SpongeBob comes out from under the sand]
",3
5289,SpongeBob,48," Hey, what about me? I was in that scrap.
",3
5290,Reg,48," [chortles] I saw you runnin'. When you get in a real fight, then we'll talk.
",3
5291,SpongeBob,48," Well, then, I guess it's time to take it up a notch. [spins his legs then hands then cracks his fingers but they are snapped in half. He starts to cry and runs off. Scene cuts to SpongeBob with his fingers in a bowl of ice cream]
",3
5292,Robot,48," Care for another sundae, weenie?
",3
5293,SpongeBob,48," I am not a weenie!
",3
5294,Nerd #1,48," Relax, you're among friends. [raises his drink]
",3
5295,SpongeBob,48," My friends don't hang out at Weenie Hut Jr's. [scroll over to Patrick in the seat next to him]
",3
5296,Patrick,48," You tell 'em, SpongeBob! [sips his drink]
",3
5297,SpongeBob,48," Patrick, what're you doing here?
",3
5298,Patrick,48," I'm always here on Double Weenie Wednesdays.
",3
5299,Nerd #1,48," Actually they moved Double Weenie Wednesday to Friday.
",3
5300,Nerd #2,48," And besides, today's Monday.
",3
5301,Patrick,48," Oh, so it's Mega Weenie Monday?
",3
5302,Nerd #1,48," Uhh, that's now on Sunday.
",3
5303,Patrick,48," Barnacles!
",3
5304,Nerd #2,48," Super Weenie Hut Jr's has a Mega Weenie Monday.
",3
5305,Nerd #1,48," Uhh, no, you're thinking of Monster Weenie Monday.
",3
5306,SpongeBob,48," I don't have time for this! I've got to go pick a fight with a muscular stranger! It's the only one of getting into the Salty Spitoon. [begins to walks out]
",3
5307,Patrick,48," No, SpongeBob, you can't. It's too dangerous.
",3
5308,SpongeBob,48," I've got no choice.
",3
5309,Robot,48," I have a suggestion. Why not fake a fight?
",3
5310,Patrick,48," Hey, that's not a bad idea! You can call me a couple of bad names, we rumble, next thing you know, you're in the Salty Spitoon.
",3
5311,SpongeBob,48," Well, I guess I've got nothing to lose. Let's do it!
",3

5318,Reg,48," Oh yeah?
",3
5319,SpongeBob,48," Yeah. I might have to beat someone up just to get rid of all this blind fury.
",3
5320,Reg,48," [sarcastically] Wow.
",3
5321,SpongeBob,48," Yeah, I feel pretty sorry for the next guy who looks at me funny.
",3
5322,Reg,48," Hmmm... what about that guy? [points to a large muscular fish behind him]
",3
5323,SpongeBob,48," [gasps and stammers] I, uhh... [laughs] don't be silly. He's not botherin' anybody. I mean, not like... that guy! [points to Patrick]
",3
5324,Patrick,48," Who, me? [SpongeBob walks up to Patrick]
",3
5325,SpongeBob,48," Yeah, you. Standing there all smiling and whatnot. Somebody oughta teach you some manners!
",3
5326,Patrick,48," Okay, but I must warn you. I happen to be a world championship... uhh... [looks at his hand, which has writing on it] ...kick boxer. [winks and gives a thumbs-up to SpongeBob]
",3
5327,SpongeBob,48," I don't care if you're the demon seed of Davy Jones! You're goin' down, Tubby! [Patrick starts to tear]
",3
5328,Patrick,48," Tubby? [gets mad] Grr! Nobody calls me Tubby! [punches SpongeBob in the eye, leaving a black mark]
",3
5329,SpongeBob,48," Wait, Patrick, you're supposed to let me win, remember?
",3
5330,Patrick,48," Oh yeah. [invisible punches flying] No, please wait. [grunting as more invisible punches hit him and an elephant sound is heard when Patrick's head is hit. Patrick is being thrown into the air and on the ground then given a wedgie] No, please have mercy! [is kicked into the background]
",3
5331,Reg,48," Wow! You destroyed that guy without even touchin' him. [Patrick is still fighting in the background]

5333,Reg,48," I never thought I'd say this, but go ahead in.
",3
5334,SpongeBob,48," Really? I can go in? Oh, my gosh, I never thought this moment would come! I, SpongeBob SquarePants, am tough enough to get into the Salty Spitoon! This is the happiest day of my life! [walks in. Scene cuts to an ambulance driving down the street with SpongeBob in bandages and Sandy by his side] Sandy? [groans] What happened?
",3
5335,Sandy,48," You ran inside and slipped on an ice cube. [ambulance arrives at the hospital. Scene cuts to Sandy wheeling SpongeBob in front of the doctor]

5337,SpongeBob,48," I slipped on an ice cube and got covered in boo-boos.

5355,Mr. Krabs,49," How about a little music to count me money to? [turns on the radio that is next to him]

",3
5361,SpongeBob,49," #17 -- [holds up a tray with food] Krabby Patty and a medium beverage. Course. Sorry Squidward, I'm not really feeling myself today. I guess I'm a little bit jumpy. I keep thinking robots are taking over the world, probably on account of this movie I watched last night where robots take over the world. I even asked Gary if he was a robot! Pretty funny, huh?
",3
5362,Squidward,49," [sarcastically] Hilarious. Just deliver the food.
",3
5363,SpongeBob,49," [delivers the food to Thaddeus] There you go! Enjoy your... Say, you're not a robot, are you?

",3
5366,Mr. Krabs,49," [from office] I feel completely recharged!
",3
5367,SpongeBob,49," That sounds like Mr. Krabs. [peeks in the window]
",3
5368,Mr. Krabs,49," Come on, little buddy, play it again. [shakes his radio] Please? One more time, for me.
",3
5369,SpongeBob,49," That was strange. Mr. Krabs was talking to his radio, and he said he feels ""recharged."" [laughs] If I didn't know better, I'd say he was... [scene zooms in on SpongeBob] ...a robot. Nah.
",3
5370,Mr. Krabs,49," [calls the radio station] Yes, hello. I was wondering if you could play that song again.
",3
5371,Radio DJ,49," [From the phone] Hmmm... which one, man?
",3
5372,Mr. Krabs,49," The one that goes ""bee-boo-boo-bop, boo-boo-beep.""

",3
5375,SpongeBob,49," Oh my gosh. Why was Mr. Krabs making all those beeping sounds? Could it be that he's... [scene zooms in on him] ...a robot? Nah. [peeks into the window again and sees Mr. Krabs doing a robot dance on his desk. He jumps onto Squidward's arms] Oh, Squidward, it's terrible! Mr. Krabs... talking to radio... beeping sounds... strange dancing... robot!
",3
5376,Squidward,49," [picks up SpongeBob off his arms] That's great, SpongeBob. Why don't you work on this problem back in the kitchen? [throws him in the kitchen. Squidward laughs, but SpongeBob reappears beside him. Squidward is confused and looks around for how he did it]
",3
5377,SpongeBob,49," I'm serious, Squidward! Mr. Krabs is a robot. And I can prove it, too.
",3
5378,Squidward,49," [confused] How did you...?
",3
5379,SpongeBob,49," Let's see, in the movie the robots didn't have a sense of humor! They couldn't laugh. Hey, Mr. Krabs!
",3
5380,Mr. Krabs,49," [runs up to the counter] What is it, boy?
",3
5381,SpongeBob,49," Squidward just told me a hilarious joke and I thought you might like to hear it.
",3
5382,Mr. Krabs,49," Is it true, Squidward? Is it hilarious?
",3
5383,Squidward,49," Umm... yeah, sure.
",3
5384,Mr. Krabs,49," Well, let's hear it, lad.
",3
5385,SpongeBob,49," Okay, here it goes! Uhh, how'd it go Squidward?
",3
5386,Squidward,49," [chuckles nervously] Uhh, it went, umm, uhh, let's see, uhh... why couldn't the 11-year-old get into the pirate movie?
",3
5387,Mr. Krabs,49," Why?
",3
5388,Squidward,49," It was rated ""R."" [laughing] Arr! Because it's... about... pirates.
",3
5389,Mr. Krabs,49," I'm not paying you to do stand up, Mr. Squidward! Now get back to work!
",3
5390,SpongeBob,49," [gasps] Not even a chuckle. See, Squidward? He didn't laugh because he couldn't laugh because he's... [scene zooms in on him] ...a robot.
",3
5391,Squidward,49," There's a logical explanation why he didn't laugh, SpongeBob. He's obviously heard it before. The only reason you think Krabs is a robot is because you watched that stupid movie. Now why don't you...
",3
5392,SpongeBob,49," Hey, Mr. Krabs!
",3
5393,Mr. Krabs,49," [runs up to the counter again] What? What is it, boy?
",3
5394,SpongeBob,49," Squidward's father never hugged him. Isn't that sad? [pretends to cry]
",3
5395,Mr. Krabs,49," Yes, I suppose that is rather sad, but Squidward can hug himself during his break! Now get back to work!
",3
5396,SpongeBob,49," Just like the robot in the movie. He couldn't cry either.
",3
5397,Squidward,49," SpongeBob, this is getting ridiculous. I'll have you know my father loved me very much!
",3
5398,SpongeBob,49," That's the final test, Squidward. The love test. Robots can't love.
",3
5399,Squidward,49," No, wait, SpongeBob!
",3
5400,SpongeBob,49," Hey, Mr. Krabs!
",3
5401,Mr. Krabs,49," [runs up to the counter again] What is it, SpongeBob?!
",3
5402,SpongeBob,49," I just wanted to tell you that Squidward loves you! [Mr. Krabs makes a blank expression on his face]
",3
5403,Mr. Krabs,49," Get back to work, Mr. Squidward.
",3
5404,SpongeBob,49," [gulps] Squidward? [Mr. Krabs is at his desk writing something when the radio stops working. Radio breaks with electronic breakage sound effect.]
",3
5405,Mr. Krabs,49," Aw, me radio died! [takes out the batteries] Hmmm, these batteries still have a little juice in 'em. I know! I'll give 'em to Pearl for Christmas. [puts the batteries in his back pocket. A bell rings and then Mr. Krabs walks over to a pot of boiling water] Me hard-boiled egg is ready! [picks up a pair of tongs] I can already taste it. Come to Papa. [takes the egg out of the water with his tongs] Got ya! And what good is a hot-boiled egg without a little salt? [picks up a pinch of salt]
",3
5406,SpongeBob,49," Mr. Krabs!
",3
5407,Mr. Krabs,49," [breaks the egg and accidentally tosses the full salt shaker into his eyes] Ahhh! Oh, my eyes! [starts screaming]
",3
5408,SpongeBob,49," Mr... [Squidward puts his hand over SpongeBob's mouth]
",3
5409,Squidward,49," Will you be quiet? Now listen, what did these robots in the movie look like?
",3
5410,SpongeBob,49," Well, they had piercing red eyes, metal pinchers for hands, and they ran on batteries.
",3
5411,Squidward,49," Okay, so tell me, does Mr. Krabs look anything like that?
",3
5412,Mr. Krabs,49," [Barges out screaming; his eyes are piercing red, his pair of the tongs snip, then it shows the batteries in his pocket]
",3
5413,SpongeBob & Squidward,49," [both screaming]
",3
5414,Mr. Krabs,49," [continues screaming as he goes into the bathroom]
",3
5415,Squidward,49," I'll evacuate the customers, you call the navy!
",3
5416,SpongeBob,49," [runs over to the phone] Hello, Operator? Get me the Navy!
",3
5417,Operator,49," Hello, you've reached the Navy's automated phone service.
",3
5418,SpongeBob,49," Squidward, the robots are running the Navy!
",3
5419,Squidward,49," Not the Navy! [over loudspeaker] Attention, everyone, run for your lives! Robots have taken over the world! [everyone is silent] Our world! [all the customers run out screaming] What do we do now?
",3
5420,SpongeBob,49," I don't know. [notices a nickel] Hey, a nickel! [he points at it]
",3
5421,Squidward,49," SpongeBob.
",3
5422,SpongeBob,49," Sorry.
",3
5423,Mr. Krabs,49," [walks out of the bathroom, his eyes back to normal] Ah, that's better. [walks back to his office] Bee-boo-boo-boo-bee-bop, boo-boo-bop.
",3
5424,Squidward,49," We need to find out what that robot did with the real Mr. Krabs, but how?
",3
5425,SpongeBob,49," Well, in the movie the hero teams up with a buddy, and they get the poop on the robot.
",3
5426,Squidward,49," They poop on the robot?
",3
5427,SpongeBob,49," Yeah, you know, they get the straight poop, ask questions, get information.
",3
5428,Squidward,49," I never thought I'd say this, but, SpongeBob, let's get that poop! [grabs the book titled How To Torture and reads it with SpongeBob. SpongeBob grabs some rope while Squidward grabs a hammer and a saw. SpongeBob also grabs some old comedy records. Scene cuts to Mr. Krabs' office, where SpongeBob & Squidward enter]
",3
5429,Mr. Krabs,49," Oh, hello, boys. [they are at the door with angry expressions on their faces] What can I do for you? [SpongeBob & Squidward lock the door, making Mr. Krabs look nervous] Heh-heh, why did you lock the door? [nervously] Why do you have that rope? Who's watching the cash register?! [shot of outside the Krusty Krab where loud crashing and everyone screaming can be heard. Back in the office, Squidward ties Mr. Krabs to a chair] SpongeBob! Squidward! What's the meaning of this?! Untie me this instant!
",3
5430,Squidward,49," Shut up! [slaps Mr. Krabs]
",3
5431,Mr. Krabs,49," Sweet Davy Jones, what the heck is going on?!
",3
5432,Squidward,49," I said ""shut up!"", you bucket of bolts! [slaps him again]
",3
5433,SpongeBob,49," I can't take it! [runs off, crying]
",3
5434,Squidward,49," SpongeBob, are you okay?
",3
5435,SpongeBob,49," Oh, Squidward, seeing you slap Mr. Krabs like that is just too horrible to watch!
",3
5436,Squidward,49," No, that's not Mr. Krabs. That's Robot Krabs. [Mr. Krabs is trying to get out of his chair]
",3
5437,SpongeBob,49," Oh, yeah.
",3
5438,Squidward,49," And the only way to deal with these robot types is to find out what they know.
",3
5439,SpongeBob,49," Right. [runs up to Mr. Krabs and then slaps him]
",3
5440,Squidward,49," SpongeBob, you got to ask him a question first.
",3
5441,SpongeBob,49," Oh, yeah. What color is my underwear? [slaps him again]
",3
5442,Squidward,49," SpongeBob, let me handle this. [turns a light on Mr. Krabs] Where's Mr. Krabs?
",3
5443,Mr. Krabs,49," [confused] What are you talking about? I'm Mr. Krabs. [Squidward slaps him again]
",3
5444,Squidward,49," We can do this all night if you want. Where's Mr. Krabs?
",3
5445,Mr. Krabs,49," I'm Mr. Krabs.
",3
5446,SpongeBob,49," Where's Mr. Krabs?
",3
5447,Mr. Krabs,49," I'm Mr. Krabs.
",3
5448,Squidward,49," Where's Mr. Krabs?
",3
5449,Mr. Krabs,49," I am Mr. Krabs! I am! I am! I am! I am! I am! I am! I am!
",3
5450,SpongeBob,49," This is one stubborn robot.
",3
5451,Mr. Krabs,49," [confused, then angrily yells] What?! [his yelling knocks over the light and SpongeBob] You think I'm a robot?!
",3
5452,Squidward,49," We don't think; we know.
",3
5453,Mr. Krabs,49," That's the silliest thing I ever heard! I am Mr. Krabs!
",3
5454,Squidward,49," [walks over to SpongeBob] He's not cracking. We'll never get it out of him this way.
",3
5455,SpongeBob,49," I got an idea. [pokes Squidward's nose] Keep an eye on him, Squidward. Don't fall for any of his robot tricks. [runs out and returns later] If Robot Krabs won't tell us where Mr. Krabs is, maybe one of his little robot friends will. [holds up a blender]
",3
5456,Squidward,49," SpongeBob, uhh, that's a blender.
",3
5457,SpongeBob,49," Yeah, but I saw Mr. Krabs talking with his radio before. He called it his ""little buddy.""
",3
5458,Squidward,49," Oh, really? Put it on the table, SpongeBob.
",3
5459,Mr. Krabs,49," You're gonna interrogate my blender? You're crazy.
",3
5460,Squidward,49," We're just gonna see what your ""little buddy"" knows. [SpongeBob sets the blender on Mr. Krabs' desk. Squidward holds up a bat]
",3
5461,Mr. Krabs,49," [panicking] No, wait! What are you going to do with me blender?! That cost me money!
",3
5462,Squidward,49," Where's Mr. Krabs? [shot of the blender] Not talking, eh? [breaks the blender with the bat]
",3
5463,Mr. Krabs,49," No! That cost me $24.95!
",3
5464,SpongeBob,49," I guess it didn't know anything.
",3
5465,Squidward,49," Go get the toaster. [SpongeBob gets the toaster then puts it on Mr. Krabs' desk]
",3
5466,Mr. Krabs,49," No, not me toaster. That cost me $32.50! [Squidward breaks the toaster and then SpongeBob sets a food processor on the desk] $62.67! [Squidward breaks it with the bat. SpongeBob picks up a coffee maker and puts it on the desk] Four... well, actually, that one was a gift. [Squidward breaks it] Nooo!
",3
5467,SpongeBob,49," [while trying to put the cash register on Mr. Krabs' desk] This is the last robot, Squidward.
",3
5468,Mr. Krabs,49," No, not my cash register! I raised it myself. I got it when it was just a little calculator. [crying] No! [sobbing and then sobbing louder]
",3
5469,Squidward,49," I thought you said robots can't cry.
",3
5470,SpongeBob,49," I also said they couldn't love.
",3
5471,Mr. Krabs,49," [crying] I loved it like it was me own.
",3
5472,SpongeBob,49," Uh, at least he's not laughing.
",3
5473,Mr. Krabs,49," Oh, I remember the laughs we used to share! [sobbing]
",3
5474,Squidward,49," SpongeBob uhh, how did that movie of yours end?
",3
5475,SpongeBob,49," The movie? Oh, yeah! The ending was great! Turns out there weren't any robots after all. It was just their... imagination. [chuckles nervously as if he anticipates Squidward to be angry at him, then checks his watch] Hey, it's time to feed Gary. [runs out while Squidward smiles nervously at Mr. Krabs and then grabs a broom and sweeps the broken pieces on the floor. Mr. Krabs becomes infuriated]

5508,Patrick,50," Well that's what I said! We're not getting paid and that's final!
",3
5509,SpongeBob,50," Ok, we'll just paint around all this stuff.
",3
5510,Patrick,50," Good, just don't pay me.
",3
5511,SpongeBob,50," First we need to set up the tarp.
",3
5512,Patrick,50," Tarp ahoy! [spreads the tarp on the floor but the camera pans to reveal its a tiny piece]
",3
5513,SpongeBob,50," We're gonna need more coverage, Patrick. [scene cuts to more tarp on the floor but not the entire floor] Now that's what I'm talking about. Well, I guess we should open these cans of permanent paint now.
",3
5514,Patrick,50," That will never ever come off.
",3
5515,SpongeBob,50," And if we get it on anything, Mr. Krabs will cut our butts off.
",3
5516,Patrick,50," And mount them on the wall. [SpongeBob takes a screwdriver and tries opening the lid] Careful, SpongeBob. Careful, SpongeBob. SpongeBob, careful. Careful, SpongeBob. Careful, SpongeBob! Careful, SpongeBob! [screaming] CAREFUL, SPONGEBOB!!
",3
5517,SpongeBob,50," Patrick, the lid's already off.
",3
5518,Patrick,50," Oh. Now it's my turn! [takes out a battle ax and hits the paint can with it. SpongeBob grabs the can]
",3
5519,SpongeBob,50," I'm thinking I should do this one too, Patrick. [carefully opens up the lid. When he does, a paint drop bounces on the tarp]
",3
5520,Both,50," [Screaming as the paint drop then bounces on every tarp and then back into the can]
",3
5521,Patrick,50," Well that was a rip-off. [wipes sweat off]
",3
5522,SpongeBob,50," Ok, Patrick, let's get our brushes ready. [holds up his big brush] Uhh, maybe we should start with a smaller brush. [takes another small brush and gets a hair out of his nose. Patrick gets all his hairs out of his nose on his brush. SpongeBob dips the brush into the can and then faces the wall] All right, Patrick, gotta get started painting this wall. With the permanent paint that we're not allowed to get on anything but the wall. Well, here we go.
",3
5523,Narrator,50," One hour later...
",3
5524,SpongeBob,50," [still standing in the same spot. nervously] Just a few more seconds of mental preparation and I'll be painting this wall.
",3
5525,Narrator,50," Two hours later...
",3
5526,SpongeBob,50," [still standing in the same spot and sweating] I'm getting to the painting.
",3
5527,Narrator,50," Three hours later... [4th wall breaks between these two lines]
",3
5528,Patrick,50," [Carrying the Three Hours Later time card] Can you move it along, I'm all out of time cards.
",3
5529,SpongeBob,50," No problem. Here I go. [makes a line of paint going down the wall. The paint starts going down but SpongeBob blows it one direction then another then another until he gets a blow dryer and blows the paint off the wall. blows the steam off the hairdryer like a gun] Yeah! Huh? [notices the big paint bubble] Barnacles! What could be worse than a giant paint bubble!?
",3
5530,Patrick,50," Oh, I know! [takes a wand, dips it in the paint then blows a big bubble] Two giant paint bubbles!
",3
5531,SpongeBob,50," Noooooo! [two giant paint bubbles merge into one] Patrick?
",3
5532,Patrick,50," Yeah, SpongeBob?
",3
5533,SpongeBob,50," I don't think this bubble can get much bigger!
",3
5534,Patrick,50," [magically finds a bicycle pump out of nowhere and puts it into the bubble] Nonsense!
",3
5535,SpongeBob,50," [yelling] Pat, no! [blows the bubble bigger until it pops. The paint splatters all over the wall, covering up all the old brown spots. SpongeBob moves out of the way for the last bit of paint to splash on the wall] We did it! We painted the whole house and without getting a drop of paint on anything but the-- [notices Mr Krabs dollar] [shocked] Flappin' Flotsam! What's that?! [his dollar on the wall has a dot of paint on it upon closer inspection. SpongeBob's eyes crack, break and drip on the floor. He then falls over] We're dead, Patrick! Do you know what that is?
",3
5536,Patrick,50," Hmm... it's a dollar. I win!
",3
5537,SpongeBob,50," That's not just a dollar. It's Mr. Krabs' first dollar! His most prized possession! And we got paint on it!
",3
5538,Patrick,50," I think you are over-reacting SpongeBob, I don't see any paint.
",3
5539,SpongeBob,50," Ok, this isn't a problem. Maybe I can just wipe it off. [tries to wipe the paint off with his tie but makes the paint even more noticeable] There! I think I got it. [notices the paint more. Screaming. Wipes it more but it gets worse. more screaming]
",3
5540,Patrick,50," Oh, now I see it!
",3
5541,SpongeBob,50," This is not good, Patrick! This is not good! Mr. Krabs is gonna be home soon, and when he sees what we did to his first dollar… [scene cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick's butt on the wall while Mr. Krabs is enjoying some tea by the fire]
",3
5542,Both,50," [Holding their butts. both shriek]
",3
5543,Patrick,50," Wait, SpongeBob, all we got to do is wash the paint off and Krabs will never know!
",3
5544,SpongeBob,50," But Mr. Krabs said…
",3
5545,Patrick,50," Forget what Mr. Krabs said! Every paint comes off with something! [scene cuts to SpongeBob standing by a washing machine]
",3
5546,SpongeBob,50," Did it work? [Patrick comes out from the washing machine with the dollar, still with paint on it, in his hands; he also has a bra on his head]
",3
5547,Patrick,50," Nope. [scene cuts to SpongeBob sanding the dollar in Patrick's hand]
",3
5548,SpongeBob,50," Did it work? [Patrick's hands are gone]
",3
5549,Patrick,50," Nope.
",3
5550,Patrick,50," [scene cuts to SpongeBob squirting sulfuric acid out of a fire hose. Screaming]
",3
5551,SpongeBob,50," Did it work? [Patrick holds up the dollar that left a hole in his body from the force of the acid, except for the part blocked by his hands]
",3
5552,Patrick,50," Nope. [scene cuts to SpongeBob banging on the dollar Patrick is holding, while Patrick is wearing a neck brace; behind them is a huge assortment of weapons and tools that apparently didn't work either]
",3
5553,Patrick,50," [whacking the dollar with a club] Oof! Oof! Oof!
",3
5554,SpongeBob,50," Nothing's working!
",3
5555,Patrick,50," Wait, SpongeBob! We're not cavemen! [walks over to a computer] We have technology! [picks up the computer and angrily grunts as he smashes it on the dollar]
",3
5556,SpongeBob,50," It didn't work.
",3
5557,Patrick,50," [Ranting] This is all Mr. Krabs' fault! If he hadn't hung that stupid dollar in the first place!...I mean, it's not like it looks any different than a regular dollar. Why hang it? You could just stick any old dollar bill on the wall, no one would even know the difference! You might as well reach in my wallet, pull out a dollar, and put it on the wall! And it would...
",3
5558,SpongeBob,50," Hurry, Patrick, take out your wallet.
",3
5559,Patrick,50," [takes out a dollar] I don't see where you're going with this...hey, a dollar!
",3
5560,SpongeBob,50," Our butts are saved, Patrick! Now all we have to...Patrick, no! [Patrick puts his dollar in a vending machine] No…why'd you put it in the... [his dollar comes out] Grab it, Pat, grab it! Hurry, hurry! [Patrick pushes it back in] Aww, Pat, no, no! [dollar comes out again] Get it, Pat, get it, get it, get it! [Patrick pushes it back in again then walks up with the chocolate bar he got to SpongeBob] Oh, no-ho-oh!
",3
5561,Patrick,50," Wanna bite? [SpongeBob is ticked off]
",3
5562,SpongeBob,50," Ok, ok, we still have time! [looks in a mirror] Don't panic SpongeBob, panic is the enemy. You are strong. Through your strength, you shall overcome! [Mr. Krabs is approaching the door, offscreen]
",3
5563,SpongeBob's reflection,50," You're on your own pal. [walks away]
",3
5564,SpongeBob,50," [screams] Hurry Patrick, put Mr. Krabs' dollar back on the wall! I got an idea! [Mr. Krabs enters his dark house where all the lights are off]
",3
5565,Mr. Krabs,50," What the…?
",3
5566,SpongeBob,50," [stammering] We're all done, sir. Everything looks great.
",3
5567,Patrick,50," Yeah, you don't have to look around. We already did that for you. [lights turn on; they are grinning suspiciously]
",3
5568,Mr. Krabs,50," You both look like you got a dirty little secret. Ha! I'm kidding. Let's see how you did. Oh, not bad boys, not bad. A nice even coat, high gloss, no bubbles.
",3
5569,SpongeBob,50," Yeah, looks great, Mr. Krabs. We'll just be going…
",3
5570,Mr. Krabs,50," Flippin' fish fossils! look what you did!
",3
5571,SpongeBob,50," [begging] Oh, Mr. Krabs, we're so sorry! Don't de-butt me! Don't de- butt me!
",3
5572,Patrick,50," [begging] Mr. Krabs, I'm sorry! Have mercy! Have mercy!
",3
5573,Mr. Krabs,50," Sorry? You dusted all my knickknacks! That was really nice. Great Barrier Reef!! what's this?
",3
5574,SpongeBob,50," [begging] It's not our fault, Mr Krabs!
",3
5575,Patrick,50," [begging] We didn't do it on purpose!
",3
5576,Both,50," [begging] Accident! Accident! Accident! Accident!
",3
5577,Patrick,50," [begging] I don't want to be butt-less!
",3
5578,Mr. Krabs,50," Oh, and I suppose the floor molding just painted itself on its own. [wall is decorated with tiny ships] That's what I call craftsmanship. Criminy jim-jam! you messed up my dollar... [runs over to a bunch of dolls lined up perfectly] ...rama! [Patrick and SpongeBob are confused] All the dolls in this dollarama were perfectly aligned! [straightens one of the dolls to an upright position]
",3
5579,Doll,50," Mama.
",3
5580,Mr. Krabs,50," And you boys thought I wouldn't notice. Oh well, I guess no harm done. All right boys, you're free to go. [runs into a long pile of paintings] Ow!!!!! That's funny, I don't remember a stack of painting jutting from the wall where me first dollar used to be. In fact, I don't remember this painting at all. [takes the picture of a clown off] Or this one. [takes the picture of a car race off] Or this one. [takes the painting off. SpongeBob and Patrick are shaking] Or this one. [takes it off] Or this one. [takes it off] Or this one. [takes it off] Or this one. [takes Painty the Pirate off. SpongeBob is behind the painting he just took off]
",3
5581,SpongeBob,50," Hi, Mr. Krabs.
",3
5582,Mr. Krabs,50," SpongeBob, what are you doing?
",3
5583,SpongeBob,50," Oh, you know, just hanging around.
",3
5584,Patrick,50," Boo!
",3
5585,Mr. Krabs,50," Get down onto the floor, boy. [SpongeBob stretches his body to the floor] Alright, now you're just being silly. [takes SpongeBob off the wall]
",3
5586,SpongeBob,50," No, Mr Krabs! No! Don't look, it's a trick!
",3
5587,Mr. Krabs,50," [angrily] Did you two get paint all over me first dollar?
",3
5588,SpongeBob,50," We're sorry, Mr. Krabs!
",3
5589,Patrick,50," We're so sorry!
",3
5590,Mr. Krabs,50," And then did you draw on it with crayon?!? [dollar has a smiley face and two dollar signs drawn on with green crayon]
",3
5591,Patrick,50," [holding a green crayon] I thought, you know, maybe he'd buy it.
",3
5592,Mr. Krabs,50," All right boys, you know what I've got to do now?
",3
5593,SpongeBob,50," You mean our butts?
",3
5594,Patrick,50," Can I use mine one last time? [Mr. Krabs takes the dollar and licks it. The paint comes off then Mr. Krabs puts the dollar back up on the wall]
",3
5595,Mr. Krabs,50," There we go, good as new.
",3
5596,Both,50," [They are shocked beyond belief. stammering] But, but, but, but. but, but. but, but...
",3
5597,Mr. Krabs,50," Yeah, I lied. This paint actually comes off with saliva! [laughs]
",3
5598,SpongeBob,50," Oh, I get it, Mr. Krabs. You told us the paint was permanent so me and Patrick would be more careful and not get paint on anything!
",3
5599,Mr. Krabs,50," Nah, I just like to mess with ya! [laughs. SpongeBob and Patrick glare at Mr. Krabs; they storm out in disgust. Mr. Krabs spits all over the place while he is laughing] The old man's still got it! [the paint comes off the wall from the spit] Aww, crud, I really gotta learn to say it, not spray it.",3

",3
5637,SpongeBob,51," Boy, Gary, this ""Plan Your Own Party Kit"" is a real life-saver. [mixing ingredients and reading a cook book] How else would I have known to make freshly-whipped clotted cream. [takes a little taste] Gary, you better call an astronomer, because this clotted cream is outta this world! [timer goes off] My piñata! [takes out the piñata from the oven and tosses it around because it's hot then puts it on the table] The ""Plan Your Own Party Kit"" suggests creativity when stuffing your piñata, so I'm using deviled eggs. [puts eggs in the piñata]

Gather around, ye scurvy landlubbers, it's time to learn the peg legged dance o' happiness. [lays out a dance mat] Oh, it's quite simple really, all you need is a peg leg and some patience. And my instructional video series, only $29.95.

5642,Potty,51," Bawk! How tacky.

5659,Potty,51," The Bird Brains. They're better than all those other bands.

5660,Patchy,51," But they're just a bunch of birds!

5661,Lead Singer,51," Hello, Encino! [The Bird Brains play all this heavy metal music]

5662,Patchy,51," Potty, that's the worst sea shanty I've ever heard! I certainly hope it doesn't get any louder. Ooooooohh!

5663,Patchy,51," No, no, no! Stop the music! [yells] Look boys, I know that you fellas sound good around the birdbath, but this here is basic cable! This is the big time. I'm afraid it's time for you to walk the plank.

5664,Lead Singer,51," You mean we're fired?

5665,Patchy,51," No. [Patchy and the band go to the plank.] Go on, start jumping, or you'll be dealing with the business end of me sword! Ha ha ha... [laughs, the birds just fly away] No! I forgot that you're birds! Ahh! [breaks down sobbing]

5698,SpongeBob,51," [he is looking angrily at his watch and tapping his foot and the doorbell rings] Well, it's about time. Okay, everyone, the last guest is about to arrive... [looks at his watch] 22 minutes late! [opens up the door to Tom Smith]
",3
5699,Tom,51," Hey, hey! [SpongeBob folds his arms in a sort of anger. Tom laughs nervously holding a bag of chips as SpongeBob walks into the party]
",3
5700,SpongeBob,51," Attention everyone. Attention please! Now that we're all here, I officially declare the party switch to be in the 'on' position! [silence. everyone claps silently] As soon as I get back from the coat room, we'll have a rundown of tonight's schedule. Try not to have too much fun without me! [laughs as he walks into a room with a sign that reads 'Coat Check'] Seriously. [closes door]
",3
5701,Narrator,51," (television version only) That includes you folks, SpongeBob's House Party will be right back after these messages. [fades out and back in] [Patchy is shown dancing and a guy in a submarine outfit walks towards the camera] Ahoy there! Welcome back to SpongeBob's House Party!

5702,Sandals,51," That's my breakfast!
",3
5703,Sandy,51," This song's got a great beat.
",3
5704,Patrick,51," Yeah. Knock, knock.
",3
5705,SpongeBob,51," Gee, I wonder why they don't hear me? [looks through the window and his eyes bug out as he wails. He sees the party, with all the guests dancing and having fun and the music blasting] Oh no! [cut to the topic cards on the floor and two fish just talking] They're not using the topic cards! They're ad-libbing! [cut to Patrick eating all the deviled eggs in the piñata in one gulp and everyone else cheering him on] Now they're mad at Patrick! He's hogging the deviled eggs! [scene cuts to two guests laughing] Look at those poor souls, they're so bored, they've gone mad! Oh, no. The party's falling into chaos without my hosting talents to guide it! [scene cuts to Patrick and Mrs. Puff talking]
",3
5706,Patrick,51," So, do you come here often?
",3
5707,Mrs. Puff,51," No. [phone rings. Patrick answers]
",3
5708,Patrick,51," Hello, SquarePants residence. What? I'm sorry, what? [scene cuts to SpongeBob using a pay phone outside, across the street]
",3
5709,SpongeBob,51," Patrick, it's me, SpongeBob!
",3
5710,Patrick,51," You wanna talk to SpongeNob?
",3
5711,SpongeBob,51," Yes... no, Patrick! I'm SpongeBob! I'm outside!
",3
5712,Patrick,51," Okay, hold on. [opens door] SpongeBob, you out here? Phone's for you!
",3
5713,SpongeBob,51," What? I-. No! Patrick! Wait! [SpongeBob runs toward the door.]
",3
5714,Patrick,51," Sorry, he's not out there. [Patrick closes it in front of him]
",3
5715,Scooter,51," Hey, dude, if you're looking for SpongeBob, he's over by the punch bowl.
",3
5716,Patrick,51," Thanks. [Patrick hands the phone to an ice sculpture of SpongeBob's head] Here you go, SpongeBob. [drops the phone in the punch]
",3
5717,SpongeBob,51," Phone in punch bowl? That's not even on the schedule! [looks up noticing the bathroom window is open. Scene cuts to Larry looking in the window]
",3
5718,Larry,51," Larry, my man, you are looking good enough to eat! [the mirror shows a real lobster on a plate] Could use a little teeth whitener, though. I'm sure SpongeBob won't mind. [looks through the medicine cabinet. He finds a comb with three angles and teeth coming out from them] Hey, check out his crazy comb!
",3
5719,SpongeBob,51," Oh no, sounds like someone's rummaging through my medicine cabinet! [climbs up the side of his house] I hope they don't touch my special comb.
",3
5720,Larry,51," Well, I think I've aired it up enough. [Larry closes the window on SpongeBob's fingers. SpongeBob falls down screaming. Larry hears the screams] Hey, this party's finally starting to pick up.
",3
5721,Pearl,51," Gee, SpongeBob really knows how to throw a great party!
",3
5722,Mrs. Puff,51," Oh yes, everything is quite lovely. [sees SpongeBob spying through the window] Eww, although I don't care for his taste of paintings. [turns the window around]
",3
5723,SpongeBob,51," I don't even know how that happened. Well, I have no choice. I'm gonna have to tunnel back in! [takes a shovel and digs. Digs up into the middle of the party] Okay, everybody, don't panic, the host has returned. [guests are hopping around the room. They hop on SpongeBob and send him through the hole he dug] I can take losing the topic cards and the phone in the punch bowl... [now wearing a bunny suit] ...but I was supposed to lead the bunny hop! This is a bunch of barnacles! I'm breaking in! [takes a pick-ax to cut the door but a bright light shines at him]
",3
5724,Officer John,51," Well, well, well. What do we have here? A burglar bunny. Why do they do it, O'Malley?
",3
5725,Officer O'Malley,51," I don't know. It's probably how he gets his kicks.
",3
5726,Officer John,51," You criminals make me sick.
",3
5727,SpongeBob,51," I'm no criminal! I live here! I'm...I'm throwing a party. I got locked out, I swear!
",3
5728,Officer John,51," [smiles] Well, why didn't you say so? What a terrible misunderstanding!
",3
5729,Officer O'Malley,51," You have a nice party now, sir. [both walk off]
",3
5730,SpongeBob,51," Boy, for a second there, I thought I was going to be arrested for breaking into my own house. What an ironic twist that would have been.
",3
5731,Officer John,51," Hey, wait a second, if you're throwing a party. Why weren't we invited?
",3
5732,SpongeBob,51," [stammer-like] But, I didn't know. Plan Your Own Party Kit didn't mention the police.
",3
5733,Officer O'Malley,51," Whoa, whoa, okay, motor-mouth, tell it to the judge. [handcuffs SpongeBob but the handcuffs are not working] Oh no, these cuffs are broken.
",3
5734,Officer John,51," Huh, can't bring him in in broken cuffs. I got an old pair in the car we can use.
",3
5735,SpongeBob,51," Is it too late to offer you some punch?
",3
5736,Officer O'Malley,51," Sir, you have the right to remain silent. [scene cuts to next day]
",3
5737,SpongeBob,51," All night in the stony lonesome in a bunny outfit! [tries to open the door] Oh, yeah, the door's locked. [lifts up the welcome mat] Good thing I keep a spare key...under the mat. Grr! [walks in] Oh, look at this place! This party was a complete disaster. [Patrick walks up]
",3
5738,Patrick,51," That was the greatest party any of us have ever been to!
",3
5739,SpongeBob,51," It was?
",3
5740,Patrick,51," Oh, without a doubt, you are the best party-thrower ever!
",3
5741,SpongeBob,51," I am?
",3
5742,Patrick,51," Yeah! Whatever you did, you should write it down and do it again next weekend. Thanks again, SpongeBob. See ya! [walks out]
",3
5743,SpongeBob,51," SquarePants, you've done it again. I guess I know how to throw a party after all. [Gary's got a lampshade on his head] Gary! Well it looks like you had a good time.
",3
5744,Gary,51," Meow.
",3
5745,SpongeBob,51," Good night, Gary. [Patchy reappears]
",3
5746,Patchy,51," Oh ho ho, I'm glad to see that old SpongeBob's party worked out. Now I gotta get me own party going! Ready for some real music, Potty?

5747,Potty,51," Bawk! Ready!

5750,Patchy,51," Thank you, Potty, I almost forgot... wait a minute, I don't play a flute, I play a fife. [the flute is revealed to be a stick of dynamite] [screaming] Potty, no! [explosion] Wow, I can't believe I survived that one. [gasp] Potty, help me!

5751,Potty,51," Ladies and Gentlemen, Bawk! The Bird Brains!

5752,Patchy,51," Aha! Great job, boys! Thanks for stopping by! Don't hit the porthole on the way out. [to the audience] And thank you for stopping by! You've made this party a real fun time. [The doorbell rings]

5753,Potty,51," Bawk, the ladies are here!
",3
5754,Patchy,51," Oh! Ladies! Shiver me timbers! Welcome, girlies! [female birds giggle as they come in and attack him] Huh! No!

5817,Patrick,52," Hm... I got it! Let's get naked!
",3
5818,SpongeBob,52," No, let's save that for when we're selling real estate... There must be SOMETHING. What was the reason we bought those bags?

5832,SpongeBob,52," Wanna buy some chocolate?
",3
5833,Patrick,52," We got him now!
",3
5834,Blue Fish with purple stripes,52," Sorry, chocolate has sugar and sugar turns to bubbling fat. Isn't that right, blubber boy?
",3
5835,Patrick,52," Hee hee, it tickles!
",3
5836,Blue Fish with purple stripes,52," As you can see, me and chocolate no longer hang.
",3
5837,Blue Fish with purple stripes,52," You can keep that for 5 bucks.
",3
5838,Patrick,52," I'll take 10!

5839,SpongeBob,52," We haven't sold one chocolate bar. I got a feeling that were too easily distracted.

5840,Patrick,52," Huh?

5841,SpongeBob,52," [raising his fist] Let's make a pact right now that we will stay focused on selling at the next house.

5843,SpongeBob,52," [Holding out his hand] Let's shake on it.

5854,SpongeBob,52," There's something to this selling game were just not getting. Other people do it, I mean look at that!

5855,Patrick,52," [reading the sign] Eat Barnacle Chips, they're delicious.
",3
5856,SpongeBob,52," They are most certainly not delicious!
",3
5857,Patrick,52," [smiling] Not the way I use them!
",3
5858,SpongeBob,52," Yet they sell millions of bags a day!
",3
5859,Patrick,52," Well, maybe if they didn't stretch the truth, they wouldn't sell as many.
",3
5860,SpongeBob,52," [Happily] That's it, Patrick! We've gotta stretch the truth!
",3
5861,Tom,52," CHOCOLATE!

5862,SpongeBob,52," We'll work as a team. Let me get this customer warmed up and you come in for the kill!

5883,SpongeBob,52," Oh, but this chocolate's not for eating. It's for...

5884,Patrick,52," You rub it on your skin and it makes you live forever.

",3
5887,Mary,52," [looking at SpongeBob and Patrick angrily] I hate you. [Slams door. Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick]
",3
5888,SpongeBob,52," If we keep exaggerating the truth, we'll be fancy living in no time!
",3
5889,Patrick,52," [Raising fist] Hooray for lying!
",3
5890,SpongeBob,52," It'll make your hair grow.

5891,Fred,52," Great! My wife's trying to grow a beard!

5903,Customer,52," What can I do for you boys?

5904,SpongeBob,52," Hello, sir. Would you like to buy a chocolate bar? We need an operation.

5905,Customer,52," Really?
",3
5906,Customer,52," Small world. What's the matter with you guys?
",3
5907,SpongeBob,52," [nervously] Um, we've got some head trauma and internal bleeding.
",3
5908,Customer,52," Well, some guys have all the luck.
",3
5909,Customer,52," I was born with glass bones and paper skin. Every morning, I break my legs, and every afternoon, I break my arms.
",3
5910,Customer,52," At night, [As SpongeBob looks up sadly, a tear runs down his face] I lay awake in agony until my heart attacks put me to sleep.

5911,Customer,52," [About to fall] Oh, no...

5912,Customer,52," [On the last step] Ow...

5915,Customer,52," [In pain] Ow...!
",3
5916,SpongeBob,52," Poor, poor man. Is there anything, anything we can do to help you?
",3
5917,Customer,52," Well, there is one thing... as you can imagine, my medical bills are extremely high, but luckily, I am able to keep myself alive by selling... chocolate bars. [gestures his head over to a massive stack of chocolate bar boxes. Bubbles come up and cut to the next scene. Cut to the customer looking out his window as SpongeBob and Patrick walk by]
",3
5918,Customer,52," Such nice boys, [far cut to the customer] it does my heart good to con a couple of Class A suckeroonies like those two! HA HA HA!
",3
5919,SpongeBob,52," [grunting] Don't get me wrong, Patrick. It's great that we helped that guy out, but there's no one left in town to sell chocolate bars to.
",3
5920,SpongeBob,52," Let's admit it, Patrick. We're failures.
",3
5921,Patrick,52," [Walking in from the left] I can live with that. [Places box on SpongeBob's box and sits on it, making a small squeaking sound]
",3
5922,SpongeBob,52," Let's change our names to Why and Bother.
",3

5925,Patrick,52," No! Don't hurt us, Tom. Please Spare Me! [Cuts to Tom laughing manically]
",3
5926,Tom,52," Finally! I've been trying to catch you boys all day! Now that I got you right where I want you... [turns back to normal] I'd like to buy all your chocolate. [Holds up a large amount of cash. Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick looking shocked, chocolate bars fall out of Patrick's shorts, along with a Hershey's kiss. Cut back to the three, SpongeBob and Patrick melt]

5928,Patrick,52," Are we living the fancy life yet, SpongeBob?

5932,Server,52," Sorry, but the whole restaurant has been rented to a private party.

5933,Squidward,52," But it's my only night to be fancy! Oh, who could afford to rent out the whole restraunt?

5934,Server,52," Oh, a couple of rich entrepreneurs and their [leaning over to Squidward] dates.

SpongeBob bounces off a chair, while sipping his cup of tea] Ahh... [toast pop out into the air, where SpongeBob eats them. Gary spits SpongeBob's pants into the air where SpongeBob lands on a target that Gary has painted] Ta-da! Not bad, partner in crime! The toast could have been a little darker, though. [Gary gives him an angry look. SpongeBob heads to the door] See you later! [opens the door where Patrick is standing there with a net in his hand]

5944,Patrick,53," Hey, SpongeBob, want to go jellyfishing?

",3
5953,SpongeBob,53," Brace yourself, Patrick. I'm about to introduce you to the greatest academic thrill ride of your lifetime! [shows Patrick Mrs. Puff's Boating School]
",3
5954,Patrick,53," [laughs] And no line!
",3
5955,SpongeBob,53," Behold Patrick, the Hallway Of Learning! [runs up to the water fountain] And this is the Fountain Of Learning! [runs to the lockers] And these are the Lockers Of Learning!

5959,SpongeBob,53," Late for being early.

5960,Patrick,53," Hey! [looks at his watch] When did I start wearing a watch?
",3
5961,Patrick,53," Ohh!
",3
5962,SpongeBob,53," [walks up to the chalkboard] And this is the chalkboard. It's the ladle that helps us drink from the Fountain Of Knowledge.

5963,Patrick,53," Ohhh!
",3
5964,SpongeBob,53," [walks up to the Good Noodle Board] And those drinks are recorded here on the Good Noodle board! [looks at Patrick]

5967,Patrick,53," But look at all the stars you have! I'll never be that good.
",3
5968,SpongeBob,53," Oh now, Patrick. I'm just like everyone else, no matter how many stars I have. Ahem! [high pitched] 74.
",3
5969,Patrick,53," Who said that? [runs over to an egg in a box] Was it him?
",3
5970,SpongeBob,53," I doubt it. That's Roger, our class science project.

",3
5974,Patrick,53," [turns light on] Sorry. [SpongeBob moves his desk to the front of the teacher's desk]
",3

",3
5976,Patrick,53," [jumps into the chair] I'm learning!
",3
5977,SpongeBob,53," This is gonna be great! [both giggle. Scene cuts to class]
",3
5978,Mrs. Puff,53," Hello class, my name is Mrs. Puff. And the only reason I say that I see we have a new student. Young man, why don't you stand up and introduce yourself?
",3
5979,Patrick,53," [confused] Who's the fat kid talking to?
",3
5980,SpongeBob,53," You, Patrick, she's the teacher!
",3
5981,Patrick,53," Oh.
",3
5982,Mrs. Puff,53," Come on now, tell the class your name. Don't be nervous. [Patrick gets up and looks at class]
",3
5983,Patrick,53," Uh...uh...
",3
5984,Mrs. Puff,53," We just want to know your name. [Patrick gets more nervous]
",3
5985,Patrick,53," Uh...uh...UH!...24! [class laughs hysterically]
",3
5986,Mrs. Puff,53," [sarcastically] Oh great, another genius...
",3
5987,Patrick,53," [sits back down] Why are they laughing?
",3
5988,SpongeBob,53," I guess it's just in the timing.
",3
5989,Patrick,53," Oh. [Patrick laughs after a brief pause]
",3
5990,Mrs. Puff,53," [writes on the chalkboard] Today's first lesson will be on turning.
",3
5991,Patrick,53," 24. [both start to giggle, and Mrs. Puff pauses and continues writing]
",3
5992,SpongeBob,53," Hey Patrick.
",3
5993,Patrick,53," What?
",3
5994,SpongeBob,53," I thought of something funnier than 24.
",3
5995,Patrick,53," Let me hear it.
",3
5996,SpongeBob,53," [stifled laugh] 25. [both try and fail to hold in their laughter. Patrick goes red in the face while SpongeBob bangs his fist on his desk]
",3
5997,Mrs. Puff,53," [overhears] That's enough! Young man, this is your first day, so I'll let you off with a warning. As for you, SpongeBob, I expect more from a good noodle. Pay attention.
",3
5998,SpongeBob,53," Yes, Mrs. Puff.
",3
5999,Mrs. Puff,53," Now then, ""Turning""; what every driver should know. When you are turning, it is important to signal at least... [Patrick places a paper on SpongeBob's desk]
",3
6000,SpongeBob,53," [looks at the drawing Patrick gave him of Mrs. Puff and gasps] Big Fat Meanie? Patrick, you can't do that! She's the teacher!
",3
6001,Mrs. Puff,53," What about the teacher? [SpongeBob screams then shivers and bites his lip in fear as Mrs. Puff sees Patrick's drawing of her. Mrs Puff now appears the same shape as Patrick's drawing to demonstrate the ""ugly"" drawing.] As if I really look like this! [puts it a drawer with a bunch of other bad drawings of her. Mrs Puff returns back to her original shape.] SpongeBob, I believe you know the punishment for two classroom disruptions. [Takes out a scraper. Scraper shines.]
",3
6002,SpongeBob,53," No...
",3
6003,Mrs. Puff,53," I'm sorry SpongeBob, but if one wishes to be a good noodle, one must behave like a good noodle. [walks over to the Good Noodle Board]
",3
6004,SpongeBob,53," [starting to cry] I'm a good noodle! I'm a good noodle!
",3
6005,Mrs. Puff,53," [about to remove the star] You'll get this star back when you earn it...
",3
6006,SpongeBob,53," [wailing] No! [As Mrs. Puff positions the scraper under the star and begins to peel it off, SpongeBob goes berserk, bouncing up and down in his seat and banging his head on his desk, constantly panting as he bangs his head.] [SpongeBob's head spins around on his body as Mrs. Puff slowly removes the star.] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!  [When the glue holding the star to the board stretches to the point of it snapping off the board, SpongeBob's eyes roll to the back of his head and he faints, sliding out of his seat onto the floor.]
",3
6007,Patrick,53," [raises his hand] Mrs. Puff, is it naptime?
",3
6008,Mrs. Puff,53," SpongeBob, I've had enough of your nonsense. Now collect your things and move to the available desk in the back of the room.
",3
6009,SpongeBob,53," What, me? But why?
",3
6010,Mrs. Puff,53," Because the Big Fat Meanie said so. Now go!
",3
6011,SpongeBob,53," [Mad] Thanks a lot, Patrick!
",3
6012,Patrick,53," Sure thing, buddy. [SpongeBob walks to the back. His classmates are staring at him]
",3
6013,SpongeBob,53," Well, I guess I can be a Good Noodle from back here. [Mrs. Puff's voice is receding as SpongeBob tries to listen from the back] It's so hard to hear. What kind of student sits back here anyway? [reads the writing on the desk] 'Skool is 4 Chumps'? Where am I?
",3
6014,Patrick,53," Psst! SpongeBob?
",3
6015,SpongeBob,53," [to himself] Just ignore him, SpongeBob.
",3
6016,Patrick,53," SpongeBob, over here!
",3
6017,SpongeBob,53," Whatever you do, don't look at him.
",3
6018,Patrick,53," Psst, SpongeBob! [grunts as he throws a piece of wadded-up paper at SpongeBob] Psst, SpongeBob! [throws a book at SpongeBob] SpongeBob? [spits a bunch of spitballs on SpongeBob's face] SpongeBob? Psst, over here. I'm trying to tell you something. Something important.
",3
6019,SpongeBob,53," [whispers loudly] What?!
",3
6020,Patrick,53," [meekly] Hi.
",3
6021,SpongeBob,53," [yells] Hi?! [he growls, removing all the spitballs, then stops when he sees Mrs. Puff angry, covered in spitballs]
",3
6022,Mrs. Puff,53," Perhaps this would be a good time for recess. [scene cuts to SpongeBob at his locker. Patrick walks up to him]
",3
6023,Patrick,53," Hey buddy! Funny stuff in there, funny stuff!
",3
6024,SpongeBob,53," [angrily slams his locker] There is nothing funny about what you did in there, Patrick! You got me in trouble! You got me moved to the back of the room! You cost me one of my Good Noodle Stars!
",3
6025,Patrick,53," [becomes angry] Who cares about a stupid star?
",3
6026,SpongeBob,53," Gee, Patrick, it seems like you would care a lot about stupid stars, considering you are one!
",3
6027,Patrick,53," I'll deal with you after class!
",3
6028,SpongeBob,53," It is after class! [a group of students crowd around SpongeBob & Patrick chanting 'fight']
",3
6029,Patrick,53," I don't see anyone fighting, do you?
",3
6030,SpongeBob,53," They're talking about us! We're fighting!
",3
6031,Patrick,53," Well, don't mind if I do! [both start to punch. The group of students start to quiet down as they notice SpongeBob & Patrick are punching but missing at the same time]
",3
6032,Student,53," This is embarrassing. [everyone leaves as Mrs. Puff walks up]
",3
6033,Mrs. Puff,53," [lifts SpongeBob and Patrick] What's going on here?! [looks at Patrick] Well?
",3
6034,Patrick,53," SpongeBob and I were fighting.
",3
6035,Mrs. Puff,53," [gasps] Fighting? [puts them down] Well, I can't believe I'm saying this, but SpongeBob SquarePants, I hereby sentence you and your friend [lights dim on Mrs. Puff and scary music plays] to detention!
",3
6036,SpongeBob,53," Detention!?
",3
6037,Mrs. Puff,53," May Neptune have mercy on your souls. [Mrs. Puff turns off the flashlight she was holding. Scene cuts to classroom where SpongeBob is sitting at the front and Patrick is sitting at the back]
",3
6038,SpongeBob,53," [sulking] In one day, I've gone from Good Noodle to Bad Egg. [angrily] It's all Stupid Patrick's fault. [turns to look at Patrick] I hate you, Patrick.
",3
6039,Patrick,53," I hate you more.
",3
6040,SpongeBob,53," I'd hate you no matter what.
",3
6041,Patrick,53," Yeah, well, I'd hate you even if I didn't hate you.
",3
6042,SpongeBob,53," [stares at Patrick for a few seconds, then narrows his eyes] I'd hate you even if that made sense.
",3
6043,Patrick,53," I'd hate you even if you were me. That's how much I hate you.
",3
6044,SpongeBob,53," I'd hate you, even if, uhh... [tries to think of something else to say] Um, I'd hate you... [points to Roger's tank] even if the light bulb keeping Roger alive went out! [The camera quickly pans over to where SpongeBob is pointing. Suddenly, the light bulb flickers, and then burns out completely, with smoke rising out of the light bulb] Huh?!
",3
6045,Patrick,53," Ohh... [He starts to turn to look at SpongeBob, but when he sees him, he quickly looks away from him, crossing his arms.] Hmph!
",3
6046,Patrick,53," [teary-eyed again] Ohhhhh...! [cut back to Roger, who is frozen inside a giant ice cube, with wind blowing]
",3
6047,SpongeBob,53," Mmmm... I'm sorry I called you a Stupid Star!
",3
6048,Patrick,53," [talking fast] I'm sorry I got you in trouble and got you moved to the back of the class and got your Good Noodle Star removed and shot the spitballs...
",3
6049,SpongeBob,53," I'm sorry your apology is so long.
",3
6050,Patrick,53," Me too! Let's save Roger! [they run to Roger]
",3
6051,SpongeBob,53," [takes Roger] I'll keep him warm and you get a light bulb from the supply closet.
",3
6052,Patrick,53," [opens the door to the supply closet] Ahh. Light bulb! [there is a pile of light bulbs but Patrick is looking at the one that is already plugged in at the top] But why does it have to be so far away? [begins to climb the pile of bulbs. SpongeBob tries warming up the egg by sitting on it, huffing and puffing on it, etc. while Patrick is still climbing the pile of light bulbs, wearing fancy clothing. Patrick finally reaches the top, blows a horn, removing this clothes, then runs down the pile with the light bulb] I'm coming, SpongeBob!
",3
6053,SpongeBob,53," Oh, where's Patrick? Aw, forget it. I've got to go find Roger some warmth! [runs into Patrick and both of their items are in the air] The light bulb! Without its warmth, Roger will die!
",3
6054,Patrick,53," Roger! Without him, the light bulb will have nothing to warm! [both jump for the item that is closest to them and crash into the floor with an item in their hands. They put the light bulb and egg back where they were]
",3
6055,SpongeBob,53," We did it, Patrick! We saved Roger's life!
",3
6056,Mrs. Puff,53," [off-screen] Good job, boys! [Mrs. Puff turns on a light from behind the chalkboard] I saw the whole thing from behind my one-way chalkboard, and I couldn't be happier with your teamwork! I've decided to give you each one gold star. Although I'm not sure what saving an egg has to do with Boating School.
",3
6057,Patrick,53," Boating School? I thought this was Spanish class! See ya, SpongeBob. See ya, Big Fat Meanie. [leaves the classroom]

[the dinosaur walks back into the middle of the room] Isn't that right, Bronty? But I'm riding YOU now! [pan out to reveal Patchy is wearing the dinosaur like an inner tube, and he struggles to get out of it] It's stuck. [He falls over on his side. He screams for aide and two stagehands run over to him. Cut to a ""Please Stand By"" screen. Soon, Patchy is up] Like I was saying, prehistoric times were the greatest. [cut to black-and-white footage of cavemen] It was a simpler time [cut to a picture of a caveman with a finger up his nose] with simpler pleasures! [cut to Patchy, holding up two robes, identical to each other and the one Patchy is wearing] Your clothes always match! [cut to Patchy with a paintbrush] You can draw on the walls! And nobody yell at ya! [he picks up a giant club] It was much easier to hit a baseball! [he sits down on the couch] Oh yeah, prehistoric times were the best. [he gasps] Hey kids!

[Back in the sand field across from the row of homes, SpongeGar reaches into his pants and pulls out half of a coconut shell with juice inside. He howls in glee. Patar sniffs it. SpongeGar gets a log and pours the liquid into it and blows into a hollow branch sticking out of the top of it, producing a bubble in a hole on the other side of the log. Patar tries to take cover from the bubble, but then sees it pop and realizes it's harmless and that there is no need to protect himself from it. So he claps and howls in delight. Then, clouds appear and it begins to rain. Patar then claps again and the rain stops, and the clouds relocate themselves. Patar smiles. SpongeGar tries his hand at it, but the rain stall. A few moments later, the clouds re-appear and it rains. Both cheer. Patar claps, and the rain ceases once more. The two get excited, and clap excessively. The rain begins, but won't stop. Next, thunder sounds, and the two stop their howling. Patar claps again, but nothing happens. Squog watches them from the second story window in his house] Patar and SpongeGar bawannagog. No pooca Squog. Squog tay taila foo.

6124,Patchy,54," I told you prehistoric times were fun! Hey! How's about I teach you kids how a caveman makes a fire with [holds up two sticks] two sticks? [he rubs them together] Yeah… Doesn't get any cooler than that, huh? Chalk one up for Patchy! [a 'I' is chalked up on the wall below a sign reading 'Prehistory'] Rubbing… [he pants. Nothing is happening, and he eventually gives up] I guess this is a type of wood that doesn't burn. [a laser shoots through and lights the two sticks on fire, startling Patchy] Potty!

6129,Potty,54," Never you mind, pops. Let's go see what Cavey thinks. [squawks. Cavey slowly approaches the robot, and touches it. The robot's eyes start flashing red. A siren goes off]

6130,Robot,54," Attack!!!!!! Attack!!!!! [Cavey starts to run off and the robot gives slow chase, shooting lasers at him. For every shot, 'The Future' score keeps going up]

6137,Narrator,54," When we last saw our hungry troglodytes, they just discovered fire. How long will it take for them to mess it up? Let's see. [scene continues as SpongeGar, Patar, and Squog continue to jump up and down hooting. They all run off. Sponge impales some long grass, toasts them, and eats them. Squog impales some primitive flowers and leaves, toasts them, and takes a bit out of them. Patar impales his loincloth, toasts that, and eats it. He burps up a charred piece and wipes his mouth with it, and then eats it. The three continue to find things to eat. SpongeGar twirls up some vines on the stick, toasts it, and slurps it up. Squog puts some rocks in a pan, toasts it, and it becomes popcorn. He eats some. Patar lifts up a rock, and a bunch of Money Krabs, like Mr. Krabs, crawl out. SpongeGar draws a circle in the sand, impales it, and lifts it, revealing a sand Krabby Patty. He toasts it. Cut to the three chewing vigorously. They all continue to eat, and they burp.]

6138,Squog,54," Bolapa. [SpongeGar, Patar, and Squog continue to run off, get something, toast it, and eat it. Over and over and over and over and over and over again, until eventually, they are on the ground, their stomachs extremely full, satisfied. They yawn and get up]

It is then taken by SpongeGar. He falls into trap Patar made and Patar grabs it instead. He then is scared off by a picture held up by Squog] Dumbo Patar. Fwee fwee Squog!

",3
6161,Patchy,54," Now I know how Squidward feels… [Potty comes in]
",3
6162,Potty,54," [squawk] Why the long face?
",3
6163,Patchy,54," I think you know perfectly well, you little winged vermin. All I wanted was to show the nice people how great the cavemen were. But all they got was technology-induced chaos!
",3
6164,Potty,54," Come back inside. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
",3
6165,Patchy,54," You got rid of the robot android cyborg?!

6174,Potty,54," Just to show you there's no hard feelings, I got you a present from the prehistoric times.

6176,Potty,54," No.

6179,Patchy,54," Aww, what is it? [Potty opens the door, revealing a T-rex, which growls at Patchy. Patchy screams, his eyes bugging out, he runs out, the t-rex giving chase] Potty!!! [he continues screaming as he runs off. Potty watches from the window, with popcorn and a soda]

6180,Potty,54," [squawk] This is great. [the dinosaur has grabbed Patchy, who screams. Patchy is on his side, his feet inside the t-rex's jaws]

",3
6200,SpongeBob,55," [whistles as Squidward frowns] Fancy. So that's what came in the mail. Looks like Gary has a new little playmate.
",3
6201,Squidward,55," Pfft, dream on, SpongeBob. [holding his snail smugly] I wouldn't let Snellie here play with that mongrel mutt. She's a purebred.
",3
6202,Patrick,55," Wow, a snail made out of bread.
",3
6203,Squidward,55," No! Purebred means she is of the highest pedigree. See? [holds up a certificate] She even has her own papers. So if you'll excuse us, Snellie has to start her training.
",3
6204,SpongeBob,55," Training?
",3
6205,Squidward,55," For Bikini Bottom's snail race. Snellie will be winning this Sunday.
",3
6206,Patrick,55," Sunday?
",3
6207,SpongeBob,55," Well, I guess I can't enter Gary in that. Sunday's laundry day!
",3
6208,Squidward,55," No, SpongeBob. You can't enter Gary because Gary's a mutt. [Gary is shown looking like a hillbilly with a chimney in his shell]
",3
6209,SpongeBob,55," Boy, you got that right. Gary's no... [scowls] hey! What makes you so sure Gary couldn't win that race? [Squidward shows the certificate again]

6212,Squidward,55," That's Tennisballs... de-derr, Tentacles! Come on, Snellie. [walks off]
",3
6213,SpongeBob,55," You know what? I'm starting to get the idea that Squidward thinks his snail is better than mine.
",3
6214,Patrick,55," No!
",3
6215,SpongeBob,55," Patrick, are you thinking what I'm thinking?
",3
6216,Patrick,55," Yeah, I should get a snail and enter it in that race and beat Squidward! [Patrick runs off]
",3
6217,SpongeBob,55," Are you thinking what I'm thinking? [Gary imagines himself watching TV] No, no, no! I'm thinking about entering you in that race and beating Squidward's snail! [SpongeBob runs off. He then returns, wearing a coach's outfit] Looks like we're going to start our training now, ladies! [laughs] I call you a lady to humiliate and demean you. It's a motivational tool we coaches use. [scene cuts to Sandy walking down the street]
",3
6218,Sandy,55," Hmm... I don't know why, but I think I'll kick SpongeBob's butt tomorrow. [scene cuts to SpongeBob opening a can]
",3
6219,SpongeBob,55," Kelp powder for muscle mass. [drops the food in a blender as Gary looks on with disgust] Raw eggs, 'cause they're cliché. [drops the eggs in the blender] And nails for toughness. [drops the nails in the blender. Turns on the blender]
",3
6220,Gary,55," Meow.
",3
6221,SpongeBob,55," Of course, I expect you to eat this. [SpongeBob pours some of the blended food into a glass] It's scientifically designed to help you win tomorrow. Gary? [Gary is already out of the room through his snail door. SpongeBob stops his stopwatch] Wow, pretty good time.
",3
6222,Patrick,55," [holding a rock] Hey SpongeBob, check out my new snail.
",3
6223,SpongeBob,55," Patrick, your snail is a rock.
",3
6224,Patrick,55," Yeah, thanks, I know. He's got nerves of steel. See you at the big race. [walks off]
",3
6225,SpongeBob,55," Boy, the competition's getting tough. [walks over to Gary watching TV] That's it, Gary. [takes out a leash] We are going to start some serious training right now.
",3
6226,Gary,55," Meow.
",3
6227,SpongeBob,55," [puts the leash on Gary. Gary tries to stretch his eyes to watching the TV as long as he can before he's pulled out of the room] Alright Gary, let's start with some sprints. [holds up a stopwatch] On your mark. Get set. Go! Go Gary, go! Come on, go, Gary! It's all yours, Gary! [SpongeBob notices Gary is not there] Gary? [SpongeBob walks up to Gary, who is watching more TV] Come on Gary, the big race is tomorrow. You got to start training if you want to win.
",3
6228,Squidward,55," [pops his head in SpongeBob's lower window] Don't waste your breath, SpongeBob. That mongrel of yours doesn't have a chance against Snellie.
",3
6229,Patrick,55," [pops his head in SpongeBob's upper window] Excuse me, but you two seem to be forgetting who the real winner will be... my snail. [shows his rock]
",3
6230,Squidward,55," Patrick, that's a rock.
",3
6231,Patrick,55," Yeah, thanks. I know. He's got nerves of steel.
",3
6232,Squidward,55," What are you standing on, anyway? [scene shows Patrick standing on Squidward's back] Like I said, don't even bother showing up tomorrow. [Squidward walks off as Patrick pops his head in the lower window]
",3
6233,Patrick,55," My snail's really got Squidward scared, huh, SpongeBob?
",3
6234,SpongeBob,55," Sorry Patrick, Gary and I have got some serious work to do. [picks up Gary and walks off]
",3
6235,Patrick,55," You can run, but you can't hide, SquarePants! [scene cuts to SpongeBob and Gary outside]
",3
6236,SpongeBob,55," Alright Gary, no more fooling around. Time to get serious. [scene cuts to SpongeBob blowing on a whistle] Come on, Gary, move it! [scene cuts to Gary crawling up and down a wall] Up, up, up, up! Down, down, down, down! [scene cuts to Gary punching a punching bag with his eyes] Faster, faster, faster! Go, go, go! [scene cuts to SpongeBob following Gary on his bike] Come on, push it, Gary, push it! [scene cuts to Gary on the toilet] Move that shell! [scene cuts to Gary in the bathtub with SpongeBob looking through the curtains] Come on, Gary, move it! [scene cuts to Gary eating] Let's go, let's go, let's go! Faster! [scene cuts to nighttime. Gary is on an exercise wheel while SpongeBob is sleeping but giving orders at the same time] Let's go, let's go! Speed it up, speed it up, speed it up! Move it, Gary! Move it, move it, move it, move it... [scene cuts to morning, where Gary is tired, out of breath, and on a leash] Stroke, stroke, stroke, stroke. [Gary is pulling SpongeBob in a wagon] Come on, Gary, we're gonna be late for the big race! [scene cuts to an announcer]
",3
6237,Nat,55," Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to our live coverage of this year's annual spring classic, the 102nd Running of the Snail. And what a beautiful day for this sport of kings, of which I am a huge fan. Seriously, I'm just a fan. I was on my way to my seat, the door was open.
",3
6238,Perch Perkins,55," Hey, what are you doing?! [Nat runs away as the announcer comes and sits down] Heh, sorry about that, folks. Let's go down to the field to join the mayor for the pre-game ceremony. [scene cuts to a large fish standing by a microphone]
",3
6239,Mayor,55," And now, for the lighting of the Torch of Good Sportsmanship, please join me in welcoming snail racing's first-ever champion, Lightning Larry Luciano! [crowd cheers as the band plays. Larry comes crawling out every so slowly with a flame attached on his back]
",3
6240,Perch Perkins,55," Would you look at that, folks? Lightning Larry Luciano, a living legend, slowly making his way center stage. And what a proud moment for this sport. The crowd is going absolutely nuts... [crowd is cheering] ...for Larry. [Larry is still crawling to the torch] He's almost there. Uhh, yes, any minute now.
",3
6241,Narrator,55," Two hours later... [band is not playing as loud]
",3
6242,Perch Perkins,55," He's almost a quarter of the way there. [As Larry is still crawling up to the torch, one of the band members faints after playing for 2 hours. The mayor checks his watch, then runs over, grabs Larry and lights the torch]
",3
6243,Squidward,55," Well SpongeBob, I must admit, I didn't think that mongrel mutt of yours would even find the starting line. Congratulations. [laughs]
",3
6244,SpongeBob,55," Save it for the Loser Circle, Squidward. Gary happens to be in the best shape of his life. [Gary is coughing]
",3
6245,Squidward,55," I'll alert the paramedics.
",3
6246,Patrick,55," [laughs] Good one, Squidward.
",3
6247,Official,55," [walks up to the contestants] You guys ready?
",3
6248,Patrick,55," [screams] A burglar!
",3
6249,SpongeBob,55," No, Patrick, that's the official.
",3
6250,Official,55," We're ready to start here, folks.
",3
6251,Squidward,55," Okay, Snellie, let's show these common, garden-variety snails what superior breeding is all about.
",3
6252,Snellie,55," Meow.
",3
6253,SpongeBob,55," Alright Gary, listen up, the competition is going to be fierce. You're the undersnail. Everybody's already counting you out. Now get out there and win, so we can rub Squidward's big fat nose in it.
",3
6254,Gary,55," Meow.
",3
6255,Patrick,55," This is what you've been training for, Rocky. This is why we're here. [official raises the flag]
",3
6256,Official,55," On your mark. Get set. [lowers the flag] Slither! [Snellie runs out first]
",3
6257,Perch Perkins,55," And they're off! Number six, Snellie, rockets out of the starting blocks, leaving the other two competitors in the dust!
",3
6258,SpongeBob,55," What! [runs over to Gary]
",3
6259,Squidward,55," Go, Snellie, you got it, baby!
",3
6260,SpongeBob,55," What are you doing, Gary?! The race has started! You let Snellie take the lead! Let's go, Gary. Start moving! You're blowing everything we trained for! Blowing it!
",3
6261,Patrick,55," It's okay, Rocky. You go when you feel like it.
",3
6262,SpongeBob,55," Gary, are you listening to me?! Get the anchors out of your pants right now! [Gary is trying to move fast] Don't give me that look! I said now, mister! Get going, Gary! [SpongeBob jumps up and down while Gary is moving slowly] Go, go, go, go, go!
",3
6263,Perch Perkins,55," And there goes number 7 out of the starting gate. Oh, hang on, folks. He doesn't look so good.
",3
6264,SpongeBob,55," Not good enough, Gary, not good enough! Faster! [Gary tries to go faster]
",3
6265,Perch Perkins,55," I do not like the look of this.
",3
6266,SpongeBob,55," Come on, Gary, it's a race! A race! Have you heard of 'em?! [Gary eyes are now really small]
",3
6267,Perch Perkins,55," That coach is pushing that snail too hard!
",3
6268,SpongeBob,55," Faster, Gary, faster, faster, faster, faster! [Gary's left eye explodes] Huh? [crowd gasps]
",3
6269,Perch Perkins,55," Oh, looks like number 7 has a blowout! [Gary's other eye explodes] Oops, make that 2, folks.
",3
6270,SpongeBob,55," Uhh, Gary? [Gary's shell breaks, showing a machine inside]
",3
6271,Perch Perkins,55," Plus, a blown head gasket! Oh, and the poor creature's still going for it.
",3
6272,SpongeBob,55," [getting worried] Umm, Gary, you can stop now! [Gary is leaving skid marks on the track]
",3
6273,Perch Perkins,55," He's losing control! [Gary is running into the walls, making a bunch of sparks]
",3
6274,SpongeBob,55," You can take a break now if you want to, Gary. [Gary is spinning on the track]
",3
6275,Perch Perkins,55," He's spinning out of control! [crowd gasps] He's heading straight for the wall! [Gary runs into a wall of tires and explodes. The crowd gasps again, then they cheer]
",3
6276,SpongeBob,55," No! [two firemen come up and extinguish the smoke. Squidward laughs] Hold on, Gary, I'm coming! [runs onto the track]
",3
6277,Perch Perkins,55," Whoa. One of the coaches seems to have raced onto the track. That is an automatic disqualification. Looks like number six has this race all wrapped up, ladies and gentlemen. [Snellie is coming up on the finish line]
",3
6278,Squidward,55," Come on, Snellie, it's all you, baby!
",3
6279,SpongeBob,55," [runs up to Gary, crying] Oh, Gary, I'm sorry! Why didn't you just say I was pushing it too hard?!
",3
6280,Gary,55," Meow.
",3
6281,SpongeBob,55," You did? [cries more] Oh, Gary, why didn't you tell me I wasn't listening?!
",3
6282,Gary,55," Meow.
",3
6283,SpongeBob,55," You did? [cries some more] Oh, Gary! Oh, Gary!
",3
6284,Snellie,55," Meow. [Snellie turns around and heads straight to Gary to help him]
",3
6285,Squidward,55," What?! [Gary notices Snellie racing towards him and he is back to normal now]
",3
6286,SpongeBob,55," Gary? [Gary and Snellie start purring at each other] Oh!
",3
6287,Crowd,55," Aww!
",3
6288,Perch Perkins,55," [laughs] My, oh, my. Folks, I have never seen anything quite like this. It seems Snellie, the leader, just went back to comfort Gary. [Squidward walks up to where the snails are at]
",3
6289,SpongeBob,55," Looks like you and I are in-laws, eh, Squidward?
",3
6290,Squidward,55," But that's impossible. If Snellie didn't win, then... [Rocky is at the finish line]
",3
6291,Announcer,55," And the winner is Rocky! [Patrick cries, the crowd goes wild and Gary and Snellie crawl away]
",3
6292,Squidward,55," I can't believe it. My purebred, which cost me $1,700, lost to a rock. [Patrick walks over with the trophy he won]
",3
6293,Patrick,55," Don't worry, Squidward, I know how much you wanted to win, so I had the trophy engraved to you.
",3
6294,Squidward,55," Gosh, Patrick, thanks. [reads the engraving] 'The 1st Place Snail Racing Cup Presented to Squidward... [we see the engraving and the camera zooms in on Squidward's misspelled last name] ...Tortellini?! Will I ever win? [everyone laughs. Sandy comes on-screen and kicks SpongeBob in the air]

6302,Squidward,56," [Evening at the Krusty Krab. He switches the 'open' sign to 'closed.' Appears very optimistic.] Closing time. The happiest time of the day! [scene cuts to SpongeBob in the kitchen crying and sniffling]
",3
6303,SpongeBob,56," Closing time. [Sniffles] The saddest time of the day! [falls on the ground still crying] Huh? [he notices an old Patty under the grill] It's a Krabby Patty. [SpongeBob tries to pick it up but it's stuck to some gum] Eww... It's cold and hard. [takes the Patty out from under the grill] This could have rolled under there years ago. [pats it on the head] There, there, little one, your journey is almost over. [SpongeBob tosses the Patty in the trash. A siren goes off as a fishing line retrieves the patty]
",3
6304,Mr. Krabs,56," [runs in] What happened? [gasps then runs up to the trash can] Someone tried to throw away a patty! [takes it off the hook]

",3
6308,SpongeBob,56," But, it's old and cold. And so very full of mold.
",3
6309,Mr. Krabs,56," You're not to make another Patty until that one is sold. Understand?
",3
6310,Narrator,56," The next day.
",3
6311,SpongeBob,56," Order up, Squidward. [puts the tray with the old Patty in the burger on the window]
",3
6312,Squidward,56," [sarcastically] Hooray. [smells the Patty then flips the top bun off. Flies buzz around the stinking patty.] Uh... SpongeBob, can I get one with less... fog?
",3
6313,SpongeBob,56," Sorry, Squidward. Mr. Krabs' orders.
",3
6314,Squidward,56," Whatever. [he hands the tray to Gus] Here you are, sir. One Krabby Patty. [Gus sniffs it. Gus screams with disgust and quickly back-flips his way out of the restaurant. Scene cuts to the Krusty crew standing by the door]
",3
6315,Mr. Krabs,56," I don't understand. We haven't had a customer in weeks. I wonder if it's the new placemats.
",3
6316,Squidward,56," What? [Shakes his head to clear his head] Placemats? Have you lost your mind? It's that old Patty you keep trying to sell to everybody! It's gone bad.
",3
6317,Mr. Krabs,56," Gone bad? That's nonsense. Bring it here, SpongeBob. [picks up the cage with the Patty inside it] Uh, why is it in a cage?
",3
6318,SpongeBob,56," Because it growled at me. [Patty starts to growl and bark like some sort of dog. Squidward hides behind Mr. Krabs]
",3
6319,Mr. Krabs,56," You two would have never have lasted in the navy. Let's see how bad you are. [takes the Patty out of its cage but it still barks and growls in Mr. Krabs' face] No...no... [the Patty barks and growls some more] Stay... [throws a 'treat' into its mouth] Thatta girl! There, there. [He pats it gently] See? Good enough to eat. [about to eat it when an ambulance goes by] Oh, look, an ambulance. Now, then. [Takes a bite. Scene cuts to him, now green in color due to food poisoning, being rolled on a hospital bed] SpongeBob?
",3
6320,SpongeBob,56," Yes, Mr. Krabs?
",3
6321,Mr. Krabs,56," Make sure you wrap up that Patty. I'm not finished with it yet! [scene cuts to Mr. Krabs in a hospital bed]
",3
6322,Purple Doctorfish,56," Well, Mr. Krabs, you gave us quite the scare.
",3
6323,Mr. Krabs,56," So I'm gonna be ok, doc?
",3
6324,Purple Doctorfish,56," Well, if you don't want to take my word for it, let's just check your chart. [looks at the chart] Let's see here. Hmmm...oh, no! [starts to shake] Oh, no, this is terrible! [drops the clipboard]
",3
6325,Mr. Krabs,56," Everything ok, doc?
",3
6326,Purple Doctorfish,56," Don't touch me! [runs out screaming]
",3
6327,Mr. Krabs,56," That's not a good sign. [thunder roars as the room turns into green. The Flying Dutchman appears. Mr. Krabs pulls his covers over his head, showing he's scared.]
",3
6328,Flying Dutchman,56," Har, har har har har har har har har har!
",3
6329,Mr. Krabs,56," Oh, no, it's the Flying Dutchman!
",3
6330,Flying Dutchman,56," Eugene Krabs, your time has come.
",3
6331,Mr. Krabs,56," I'm not Eugene Krabs, I'm, uhh, Harold. Harold, uhh... [looks at the flower vase next to him] Flower!
",3
6332,Flying Dutchman,56," Oh, sorry. I must have the wrong room. [flies out] Excuse me, nurse?
",3
6333,Nurse,56," [in a happy, musical tone] Yes?
",3
6334,Flying Dutchman,56," I'm looking for Eugene Krabs.
",3
6335,Nurse,56," Oh, he's in that room right there.
",3
6336,Flying Dutchman,56," No, that's Harold Flower's room.
",3
6337,Nurse,56," [confused] Harold Flower? [Flying Dutchman goes back to Mr. Krabs in anger]
",3
6338,Flying Dutchman,56," So, Krabs, you thought you could fool the Flying Dutchman?
",3
6339,Mr. Krabs,56," What do you want from me?
",3
6340,Mr. Krabs,56," Davy Jones' locker?! Why do I have to go there? I'm not a bad crab!
",3
6341,Flying Dutchman,56," Ah, but you were cheap, and being cheap is a terrible thing. Next stop, Davy Jones' locker! [Evil laughs. Scene cuts to Davey Jones' locker where Flying Dutchman and Mr. Krabs reappear] Here we are.
",3
6342,Mr. Krabs,56," [smells something nasty] Blec! Why does it smell so foul?
",3
6343,Flying Dutchman,56," Davy Jones works out a lot. [opens the locker where a bunch of smelly gym socks are] These are his socks. Get in!
",3
6344,Mr. Krabs,56," [gets on his knees and starts crying] Oh, please, Mr. Dutchman, I don't want to go in there! I'll do anything! Please, give me another chance!
",3
6345,Flying Dutchman,56," Come on, Krabs, show a little dignity.
",3
6346,Mr. Krabs,56," Mommy!
",3
6347,Flying Dutchman,56," Alright, alright, stop your crying. I'll give you another chance, but you must always be generous, never cheap.
",3
6348,Mr. Krabs,56," You have me word as a sailor. [scene cuts to the Krusty Krab where a sign hangs over it that says 'Out of Business']
",3
6349,Squidward,56," [looking through Mr. Krabs desk drawers] Mr. Krabs' nose hair clippers. I could use these. [SpongeBob is wearing his hat and spatula, crying]
",3
6350,SpongeBob,56," Squidward, you shouldn't be going through Mr. Krabs' belongings. [sniffs] He won't like it.
",3
6351,Squidward,56," SpongeBob, I told you what the doctor said. Mr. Krabs isn't coming back. [Wears a stethoscope. Tries to open the safe, putting a stethoscope onto the safe to avoid suspicion. ] Now, keep quiet so I can hear the tumblers in his safe. [Mr. Krabs walks in]
",3
6352,Mr. Krabs,56," Hey, boys! [SpongeBob screams with joy as Squidward sheepishly hides his stethoscope behind his back]
",3
6353,SpongeBob,56," Mr. Krabs, I knew it! You're alive! [clings to Mr. Krabs happily] Squidward, look, it's Mr. Krabs! Isn't this too good to be true?
",3
6354,Squidward,56," Well, it was.
",3
6355,Mr. Krabs,56," You know, boys, being sick made me do a lot of thinking. My whole life has been about money. Saving money, collecting money, [mimics being infatuated to money] touching money... [returns back to normal talking] Well, you get the picture. But no more. You're looking at the new, improved, non-cheap Mr. Krabs. [scene cuts to outside the Krusty Krab where a giant 'Grand Re-Opening' sign is hanging. 'Buy' and 'Free' signs are in the window] Welcome all, welcome! [a little kid walks up to Krabs] Hello, little one. What you got there?
",3
6356,Timmy,56," A Krabby Patty.
",3
6357,Mr. Krabs,56," [laughs] Of course, you do! You know what that means, right?
",3
6358,Timmy,56," I don't go hungry?
",3
6359,Mr. Krabs,56," No, silly! It means free toy! [gives him a little toy]
",3
6360,Timmy,56," Gee, thanks, Mr. Krabs. I thought you were a cheap, old tightwad.
",3
6361,Mr. Krabs,56," I was, son, I was. Free toys for everyone! And free refills! [everyone cheers. Mr. Krabs runs up to SpongeBob] Hello boy! Say, where's Squidward?
",3
6362,SpongeBob,56," Oh, he's taking one of those break things in your office, I mean, the 'employee lounge'. [scene cuts to Squidward sleeping in Mr. Krabs office]
",3
6363,Mr. Krabs,56," [Joyfully] Great!
",3
6364,Martha,56," Excuse me, but I dropped my Krabby Patty. Could I get another one?
",3
6365,Mr. Krabs,56," SpongeBob?
",3
6366,SpongeBob,56," Yes sir. [takes the patty and lifts the top bun where a disclaimer, written in ketchup form, is shown] Krusty Krab policy clearly states that once the burger has reached the customer, it is his/her responsibility...
",3
6367,Mr. Krabs,56," SpongeBob! [puts down the bun] That's the old policy. Now run back and bring out a fresh one.
",3
6368,SpongeBob,56," Aye, aye, sir. [goes into the kitchen]
",3
6369,Mr. Krabs,56," Sorry about the confusion. [pulls out a toy] Free toy? [Martha takes it]
",3
6370,Squidward,56," Eugene, my man.
",3
6371,Mr. Krabs,56," Squidward! How's the break coming?
",3
6372,Squidward,56," Should be over in a couple of hours. Have SpongeBob send back a patty and an iced-tea, will you? [Winks then walks off]
",3
6373,Mr. Krabs,56," Sure thing, Squidward. Take it easy. [walks up to a customer watching a movie on a small television hanging from the ceiling] Are you enjoying your in-meal movie?
",3
6374,Harold,56," This movie hasn't even been in the theaters yet!
",3
6375,Mr. Krabs,56," [pats the customer on the back] No expense spared for my valued customers. [scene cuts to Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob standing in front of the restaurant] Look at all those happy faces. It sure does feel good to be generous.
",3
6376,Squidward,56," [walks in with some envelopes] Here's your mail, Eugene.
",3
6377,Mr. Krabs,56," Thanks, Squidward. You look rested.
",3
6378,Squidward,56," Yeah, these naps at work are doing wonders for me.[stretches and yawns a little]
",3
6379,Mr. Krabs,56," Credit card bills. Well, I knew this was coming. Let's see what the damage is. [opens the envelope] Only ten thousand dollars. That's not so bad. [runs up to the cash register] I'll just subtract it from today's profit. [opens the register but there is no money in it] And... there's no money in here. [laughs] How delightful.
",3
6380,SpongeBob,56," Squidward, I'm worried about Mr. Krabs.
",3
6381,Squidward,56," Me too, how are we going to get paid? [both walk up to Mr. Krabs] Gee, Mr. Krabs, you sure are taking total bankruptcy well.
",3
6382,Mr. Krabs,56," Oh, it's just a bad dream. I'll wake up soon. [SpongeBob and Squidward look at each other]
",3
6383,Squidward,56," Uh... ""dream""?
",3
6384,Mr. Krabs,56," Sure. I'm still in the hospital sleeping like a baby!
",3
6385,SpongeBob,56," Umm, you checked out of the hospital this morning.
",3
6386,Squidward,56," Here's the bill. [Mr. Krabs takes the bill that Squidward handed in]
",3
6387,Mr. Krabs,56," You mean... I'm awake? [he screams as his head cracks through the middle over and over. Each time he cracks his head open, a new one appears. He races up to Nat drinking a Mountain Dew-like drink and he confiscates it from him] No more refills! [takes it to the soda machine and the drink gets sucked back into it like a vacuum. Then he runs up to two kids playing with toys. He steals them also.] Give me back them toys, you freeloaders! [He then runs back over to Harold watching the movie earlier] Show's over, cheapskate! [turns the TV off then presses a button that erases his memory of the movie. Harold goes dizzy.]
",3
6388,Customer #3,56," Hey, it's my lucky day, a penny! [reaches for the penny]
",3
6389,Mr. Krabs,56," [grabs a hold of the customer's arm] Your luck just ran out.
",3
6390,Customer #3,56," Hey man, ease back, you're crushing my arm.
",3
6391,Mr. Krabs,56," Unhand that penny, or the arm comes off. [Flying Dutchman reappears. The customer runs away]
",3
6392,Flying Dutchman,56," A-ha! That little display of parsimonious penny pinching just earned you a nice little spot in Davy Jones' locker... For eternity
",3
6393,Mr. Krabs,56," I'm not cheap, I'm generous!
",3
6394,Squidward,56," You almost tore a man's arm off for a penny.
",3
6395,Mr. Krabs,56," [sarcastically] Thanks, Squidward, I knew I could count on you. [Flying Dutchman picks up Mr. Krabs] Well, a deal's a deal. Let's go.
",3
6396,SpongeBob,56," Wait just a burger-flipping second. [Flying Dutchman turns around]
",3
6397,Flying Dutchman,56," Who dares back-sass the Flying Dutchman?
",3
6398,Flying Dutchman,56," He'd sell your soul for a couple of bucks.
",3
6399,SpongeBob,56," I'd bet my soul he wouldn't.
",3
6400,Flying Dutchman,56," You got yourself a bet. Okay, Krabs, I'll let you stay, but first, help me settle a bet. If you had to choose between SpongeBob and all the money I have in my pocket, which would you take?
",3
6401,Mr. Krabs,56," That depends, how much money we talking about?
",3
6402,SpongeBob,56," Mr. Krabs!
",3
6403,Flying Dutchman,56," [shows money] 62 cents.
",3
6404,Mr. Krabs,56," I'll take the money.
",3
6405,SpongeBob,56," Mr. Krabs!
",3
6406,Mr. Krabs,56," [Runs to Squidward happy] Look, Squidward, money!
",3
6407,Squidward,56," Mr. Krabs, I can't believe I'm saying this, but how could you trade SpongeBob for sixty-two cents?
",3
6408,Mr. Krabs,56," You think I could've gotten more?
",3
6409,Squidward,56," He stuck up for you and you sold him out. You should be ashamed of yourself!
",3
6410,Mr. Krabs,56," [Briefly looks at his change in a sad way until starting to cry.] Oh, what have I done? [cries] I want another chance! I didn't learn anything! I lost me best fry cook. I don't want this foul money. [throws the change on the ground] I want SpongeBob back! [Flying Dutchman reappears and drops SpongeBob on the floor]
",3
6411,Flying Dutchman,56," Here, take him back.
",3
6412,Mr. Krabs,56," You heard what I said about the money?
",3
6413,Flying Dutchman,56," Heard what you said? I couldn't hear myself thinking with this one around. I only had him for thirty seconds. [scene cuts to SpongeBob and Flying Dutchman at Davy Jones' locker with SpongeBob talking a lot] And it's jellyfishing this and Mermaid Man that. Why, not giving him back is a fate worse than death!
",3
6414,SpongeBob,56," [In the Davy Jones' locker scene, talking simultaneously with the Flying Dutchman's explanations, talking super quickly] Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy merchandise were the closest thing to everything. I love jellyfishing, you should love jellyfishing. You should come some time and bring your own net!
",3
6415,Flying Dutchman,56," He's your problem now. [Evil laugh as he disappears]
",3
6416,Mr. Krabs,56," Heh, about trading you for pocket change...
",3
6417,SpongeBob,56," Say no more, Mr. Krabs. You did it for the Krusty Krab. I would have done the same thing.
",3
6418,Mr. Krabs,56," You would have?
",3
6419,SpongeBob,56," No. [all laugh. Scene cuts to the Flying Dutchman sitting on a chair, reading a book until the phone rings]
",3
6420,Flying Dutchman,56, [picks up phone] Dutchman's residence. [SpongeBob is on the other end talking a lot of fast talking. Flying Dutchman groans],3

[cut to the Krusty Krab where Squidward is at the register, bored. SpongeBob walks through the doors with a pink flower around his head. He tosses flower petals into the air] Happy first day of summer, Squidward! [walks over to Squidward] Care to join me for solstice caroling?

",3
6446,Mr. Krabs,57," Playground? Luring away me young customers. Warm up the boat, SpongeBob. [cut to the playground. SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs pull up in their boat. They peek out using a pair of binoculars]
",3
6447,SpongeBob,57," See anything, Mr. Krabs?
",3
6448,Mr. Krabs,57," Oh, they're here, all right. Just look at them, SpongeBob. [two kids are swinging] So weak and malnourished. [one of the kids is eating a lollipop] With nobody trying to sell 'em nothing. [a kid slides down a slide] Breaks me heart. [cries] No! I've got nothing to live for, SpongeBob!
",3
6449,SpongeBob,57," The way you drove the boat while lying on the ground was kind of cool.
",3
6450,Mr. Krabs,57," True. But that's not gonna get these munchkins away from this playground. Unless... hmmm... see you tomorrow, boy. Got a lot of work to do. [drives off]

[a group of kids are lined up at the Krusty Krab where a sign reads ""Krabby Land"" is hanging. A giant sheet is covering some sort of area. SpongeBob walks up to Mr. Krabs]

I mean, Krabby Land! [the kids cheer] Okay, kids, now promise Uncle Krabs that if you get hungry while you're playing, you'll come inside for some delicious, nutritious Krabby Patties.
",3
6459,Kids,57," We promise.

6466,Kids,57," We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby!
",3
6467,SpongeBob,57," [while kids are yelling ""We want Krabby"" eight times] Where is Krabby, Mr. Krabs?
",3
6468,Mr. Krabs,57," He'll be here after I count their money. Just stall 'em.
",3
6469,SpongeBob,57," Stall 'em? How do I do that?
",3
6470,Mr. Krabs,57," I don't know. Be entertaining. [leaves]
",3
6471,SpongeBob,57," [turns around and sees the kids, angry; he laughs nervously and waves] Hey, kids!
",3
6472,Monroe,57," You're not Krabby the Clown.
",3
6473,SpongeBob,57," No, I'm not. I'm, uh... [puts on a mask] I'm Krabby's beloved sidekick, the Krabby Patty..Umm... Burglar!
",3
6474,Tyler,57," Lame.
",3
6475,SpongeBob,57," Krabby will be here soon. He, uh, had to take the bus. But in the meantime, let's have some fun! You kids like bubbles? [picks up a bubble wand]
",3
6476,Monroe,57," No.
",3
6477,SpongeBob,57," Well, you've never seen my bubbles. [blows a jellyfish bubble] Voila! A bubble shaped like a jellyfish. How 'bout that?
",3
6478,Tyler,57," Still lame. [bubble pops]
",3
6479,SpongeBob,57," [dips wand again] Okay, prepare to be blown back on your tailfins. [blows a seahorse bubble] Ta-da! [Tyler pops the bubble] Uh... huh.
",3
6480,Kids,57," You stink! Bring on the clown!
",3
6481,SpongeBob,57," Okay, uh... and now for a finale! [starts blowing a bubble] Oops.
",3
6482,Kids,57," Boo! Boo! Boo! Boo!
",3
6483,SpongeBob,57," [the bubble pops in his eyes making it red. He screams] My eyes! [scream and trips over a barrel] Whoa! [crashes into The Pit of Doom which is actually a dumpster then swings over a tire. Lands in a pool of bowling balls then the tire lands on him. Kids start to laugh SpongeBob then begins to think...] [Inner Monologue] They seem to respond to me being in pain. They enjoy other people's misery. [Normal speech] Hey kids, check this out. [picks up his bubble wand and dips it in the bubble soap then throws the wand away. Pours all the bubble soap in his eyes which swell up and he screams]
",3
6484,Kids,57," Woo-hoo!
",3
6485,SpongeBob,57," I got 'em right where I want 'em. [SpongeBob puts a piece of tape on his face and rips it off, revealing a portion of his face is missing and he screams]
",3
6486,Kids,57," Woo-hoo! Yeah!
",3
6487,SpongeBob,57," [lies on the ground with his tongue sticking out. A truck runs over his tongue over and over and he screams]
",3
6488,Kids,57," Ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha! [SpongeBob walks up to a muscular guy and hands him some money. The muscular guy hits him with a big hammer. SpongeBob gives the thumbs up] Yeah, woo! [muscular guy smashes SpongeBob with a wrecking ball] Ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha!
",3
6489,SpongeBob,57," [SpongeBob gives a thumbs-up. Later, SpongeBob is tied to two poles with a muscular guy holding a can of lima beans; screams as muscular guy shoves a spoonful of lima beans in SpongeBob’s mouth. All the kids cheer]
",3
6490,Kids,57," [laughing]
",3
6491,SpongeBob,57," [being used as a ball in the two muscular guys' ping pong game] Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
",3
6492,Kids,57," Yay! [SpongeBob’s arms are getting stretched by two muscular guys] Yeah! [SpongeBob is in two pieces but gives two thumbs up. Cut to Mr. Krabs' office where he is counting the money he has received from the kids. SpongeBob enters his office in pieces]
",3
6493,SpongeBob,57," Ugh. Mr. Krabs? I can't take any more of this stalling stuff.
",3
6494,Mr. Krabs,57," Always thinking about yourself. Get out there and stall! What happened to your arms and legs, boy?
",3
6495,SpongeBob,57," The kids are using them as... boomerangs. [one of SpongeBob’s legs flies in and back out]
",3
6496,Mr. Krabs,57," Boomerangs? Oh no! They might break my windows!
",3
6497,SpongeBob,57," What are we gonna do?
",3
6498,Mr. Krabs,57," Well, now that all their money's counted, tell them Krabby has just arrived!
",3
6499,SpongeBob,57," [hops on top of the table] Really? He's here? [bounces up and down] Oh, boy! Oh boy! Oh boy! Oh boy! Oh boy!
",3
6500,Mr. Krabs,57," Get out there and tell 'em!
",3
6501,SpongeBob,57," [walks outside] Listen everybody. Krabby the Clown is in the building!
",3
6502,Kids,57," Yay!
",3
6503,SpongeBob,57," Who do you want?
",3
6504,Kids,57," Krabby!
",3
6505,SpongeBob,57," When do you want him?
",3
6506,Kids,57," Now! Krabby, Krabby, Krabby! [all running up to Mr. Krabs] Krabby! Hooray!
",3
6507,Mr. Krabs,57," Hey kids! Are you ready to meet Krabby the Clown?
",3
6508,Kids and SpongeBob,57," Yay!
",3
6509,Mr. Krabs,57," All right, here you go! [turns around with a blue nose and tie on] Hey kids! Uh, thank you all for coming! Thank you. Eat plenty of Krabby Patties! [laughs and walks back toward his office, leaving children including SpongeBob puzzled] Ah, Krabs, you've done it again!
",3
6510,SpongeBob,57," I'll say you have.
",3
6511,SpongeBob,57," [frowning] How could you, Mr. Krabs? You promised these children Krabby the Clown, but all I saw out there was... Cheapy the Cheapskate!
",3
6512,Mr. Krabs,57," Hey, I ain't cheap! [takes off his fake nose and rubs the blue paint off it] Now take this tomato back to the kitchen before it spoils.
",3
6513,SpongeBob,57," But what about the true meaning of summer? What about the children?
",3
6514,Mr. Krabs,57," [walks to the window] The children? I don't care about the children. [starts to climb out the window] I just care about their parents' money. Ah, the fact that their feeble minds are easily manipulated by cheap playgrounds and talentless clowns is no skin off my nose. [climbs out] Survival of the fittest, SpongeBob! Survival of the fittest. [laughs]
",3
6515,Kid,57," Ahem.
",3
6516,Mr. Krabs,57," Huh? [angry children are standing behind him] Oh, hey kids. [smiles nervously] Uh... Uncle Krabs has to go to the bank now. Heh.
",3
6517,Monroe,57," Get him! [all the kids run after him]
",3
6518,SpongeBob,57," [inside, sounds of Mr. Krabs getting beat up by the kids is heard] [sighs] I suppose I'll never know the true meaning of summer. I thought I knew it once, but that was a long, long time ago.
",3
6519,Squidward,57," You mean this morning?
",3
6520,SpongeBob,57," Yeah. [a noise is heard outside]
",3
6521,Monroe,57," Come on outside, Mr. SquarePants. It's a summer miracle!
",3
6522,Kids,57," [money is falling from the sky] Yay! Hooray!
",3
6523,SpongeBob,57," Wow, thousands of dollars fluttering in the breeze. I guess that's the true meaning of summer.
",3
6524,Kids,57," Hooray! [a kid on top of the Krusty Krab is throwing money down]
",3
6525,SpongeBob,57," Where's Mr. Krabs? He's missing out on all the summer fun.
",3
6526,Mr. Krabs,57, [is tied to poles like SpongeBob was earlier] Let me go! I gotta get some of that green stuff! [a muscular guy places a spoon of lima beans in front of him] No! Not that green stuff! [a lima bean truck backs up] Noooooooooo!,3

6533,Ted,58," Oh, no, I lost my pen.
",3
6534,Waitress,58," You can borrow mine.
",3
6535,Ted,58," Thanks.
",3
6536,SpongeBob,58," I lost something once. I lost something I couldn't live without-- my identity.
",3
6537,Ted,58," So, anyway, thanks for the pen.
",3
6538,Waitress,58," No problem, hon.
",3
6539,SpongeBob,58," [walking on the counter] It all started last week-- Monday morning to be exact-- the day I lost my identity.
",3
6540,Ted,58," [Whispers] I've gotta go. [flashback to Monday morning where SpongeBob is sleeping until his alarm goes off]
",3
6541,SpongeBob,58," [jumps up and throws his blanket in the air] Good morning, world, and all who inhabit it. [his blanket lands on his head and he struggles to get it off] Awk! Gary, help! I can't see. Gary! [SpongeBob puts his foot on the floor to feel around for Gary] Gary, are you there? [falls on his face. His alarm falls on his head] Ow! [stands up] Gary? Gary, buddy? I need you to be my eyes, okay? Am I near the bathroom? [shrieks as he falls down the staircase. When he falls into the living room, his alarm clock spits him out] Gary? Gary? [hits one of his windows] Gar? [slides off the window]
",3
6542,Gary,58," Meow.
",3
6543,SpongeBob,58," Gary. Now that my horrific incident of terror is over, how about some breakfast? [grabs a can of snail food then sings and dances] The most important meal of the day, serving it up Gary's way-- pop! [pours the can into Gary's bowl] Enjoy, buddy. Hmm, you know, I've been feeding this to Gary for years, and I don't even know what it tastes like. [sticks out his tongue and tastes the snail food but finds it disgusting, sound echoes from his pineapple house] Bleah! [sound echoes through the streets] Bleah! [sound echoes to the Snail Po headquarters] Bleah!
",3
6544,Sadie,58," What is it, Peterson?
",3
6545,Peterson,58," I'm not sure. I feel... a disturbance. [cuts back to SpongeBob's house where he is carrying his pants on a hanger]
",3
6546,SpongeBob,58," That was the worst thing I've ever tasted. Oh well, at least I'll never have to do it again. [looks at his watch] Barnacles! All these shenanigans made me late for work. [puts his pants on the wrong way] Uh oh. [puts his pants on the right way] All right! [walks out the door and past Patrick]
",3
6547,Patrick,58," Hi, SpongeBob!
",3
6548,SpongeBob,58," Hi Patrick! La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! [flashback to the present at the Diner]
",3
6549,Waitress,58," Wait a minute. When exactly did you lose your identity?
",3
6550,Ted,58," Yeah, and who's Patrick?
",3
6551,Diner Chef,58," And why did you eat Snail-Po?
",3
6552,SpongeBob,58," Ah, ah, ah, patience, good people. A great story can't be rushed. However, I will skip ahead to the Krusty Krab. [cut to the Krusty Krab where SpongeBob opens the door with a food tray in his hand] Order up! [walks to the customer] One Krabby Patty grilled with the fiery warmth of my beating heart. Enjoy.
",3
6553,Customer,58," Thanks, uh... [looks closely at his shirt] Oh.
",3
6554,SpongeBob,58," Is there a problem?
",3
6555,Customer,58," Well, you really should be wearing a name tag so I can thank you properly.
",3
6556,SpongeBob,58," [laughs] While it is against my philosophy to disagree with the customer, I must point out that I am in fact wearing a name tag, right here. [points to an empty spot on his shirt where his name tag should be] Huh? [gasps over and over after he finds out he's not wearing a name tag. Squidward walks up to him]
",3
6557,Squidward,58," Uh, SpongeBob?
",3
6558,SpongeBob,58," Oh, Squidward, it's terrible! It's the most terrible thing that's ever happened to me. I lost my name tag. Pourquoi!
",3
6559,Squidward,58," SpongeBob, take it easy! I'm sure you can get a new one.
",3
6560,SpongeBob,58," But I don't want a new one, Squidward. My name tag is out there somewhere. Lost... Hungry... Who will help it? What if someone's using it? [SpongeBob imagines a quiet bank and a bank robber bursting in wearing a mask over his head and SpongeBob's name tag]
",3
6561,Bank Robber,58," Alright! Nobody move! This is a bank robbery! Attica! [cuts back to SpongeBob who hyperventilates in fear]
",3
6562,SpongeBob,58," I'm innocent, I tell ya! [faints then awakens and walks over to Squidward] Squidward, what happened?
",3
6563,Squidward,58," Hmm? Oh, you fainted because you lost your name tag or something.
",3
6564,SpongeBob,58," Huh? [hyperventilates again]
",3
6565,Squidward,58," SpongeBob, will you get a hold of yourself? Since when is losing your name tag the end of the world? [Mr. Krabs comes out of his office]
",3
6566,Mr. Krabs,58," Attention, all employees! Just a quick heads-up, boys. There's going to be a surprise uniform inspection in one hour. Anyone who doesn't pass gets the boot! [SpongeBob and Squidward stare at Mr. Krabs, who pulls out a big, black boot] This boot, to be exact. It's very stinky, and you'll have to wear it all day. See you in an hour. [SpongeBob starts gasping again]
",3
6567,Squidward,58," SpongeBob, if you really want to find your name tag, just retrace your steps.
",3
6568,SpongeBob,58," Retrace my steps? Squidward, you're a genius.
",3
6569,Squidward,58," [flattered] Huh. Huh. A genius? Well, I don't know about that, but...
",3
6570,SpongeBob,58," [walks off] Cover me till I get back, okay?
",3
6571,Squidward,58," Oh, sure, sure. [chuckles] A genius? Well, how about... Hey! [cuts to SpongeBob walking down the road]
",3
6572,SpongeBob,58," Let's see, if I'm going to retrace my steps, I got to remember everything I did this morning. [walks by Patrick]
",3
6573,Patrick,58," Hi, SpongeBob.
",3
6574,SpongeBob,58," Oh, hi Patrick. [runs back to Patrick] You said hi to me this morning, right?
",3
6575,Patrick,58," As I do every morning.
",3
6576,SpongeBob,58," Well, I need you to do it again.
",3
6577,Patrick,58," That wasn't part of the deal, SquarePants!
",3
6578,SpongeBob,58," Patrick, what are you talking about?
",3
6579,Patrick,58," My hellos aren't just some tape recording that you can rewind and play over and over. They're special!
",3
6580,SpongeBob,58," Patrick, this is an emergency! I lost my name tag this morning, and I need to retrace my steps.
",3
6581,Patrick,58," You lost your name tag? [hyperventilates like SpongeBob does. Scene cuts to SpongeBob poking his head out his window and Patrick standing outside his house]
",3
6582,SpongeBob,58," Okay, Patrick, you know the plan, right?
",3
6583,Patrick,58," I got it, I got it. You're gonna retrace your steps and when you walk by me I say ""hi"", just like this morning.
",3
6584,SpongeBob,58," Perfect. Hmm, I guess I should start with when I woke up. [climbs in bed] I sure hope this works. [pretends to go to sleep then jumps up] Good morning, world, and all who inhabit it! [blanket falls on his head which causes him to fall and his alarm clock to fall on him again] So far, so good. [falls down the staircase and lands in his living room. The alarm clock shoots him out] I don't see my name tag up here. [smacks into his window then slides off of it to Gary] Now that my horrific moment of terror is over, how about some breakfast? [grabs a can of Snail-Po and sings] The most important meal of the day, serving it up Gary's way. [pours the food into Gary's bowl, then tastes it] Bleah! Okay, next I just have to walk outside and say hi to Patrick. [walks by Patrick, outside, but he doesn't say anything] Patrick!
",3
6585,Patrick,58," What?
",3
6586,SpongeBob,58," You were supposed to say hi to me.
",3
6587,Patrick,58," Hi.
",3
6588,SpongeBob,58," Oh. All right, let's take it from the top. [walks off]
",3
6589,Patrick,58," Hi, SpongeBob.
",3
6590,SpongeBob,58," Don't forget your line this time!
",3
6591,Patrick,58," I won't.
",3
6592,SpongeBob,58," Good morning, world, and all who inhabit it. [falls down the staircase] The most important meal of the day. La-la-la... Gary's way. Bleah. [walks by Patrick who, again, says nothing] Patrick, why didn't you say hi to me?
",3
6593,Patrick,58," What's my motivation?
",3
6594,SpongeBob,58," Forget the motivation. Just say hi. [walks off. Cuts to SpongeBob doing his routine again. Then walks by Patrick]
",3
6595,Patrick,58," Hi, Patrick! Oh wait, I'm Patrick! I'm sorry. Sorry. [laughs] I'm sorry. Let's try it again. [cuts to SpongeBob doing his routine again. Then walks outside past Patrick] Hi, SpongeBoob! Ha! SpongeBoob! I sai... I sai... [laughs] Who's SpongeBoob? I said SpongeBoob! Again, again. Sorry people. [cuts to SpongeBob doing his routine again. Then he walks outside by Patrick, who is trying not to laugh] I've got the giggles.
",3
6596,SpongeBob,58," Oh, what's the use? I'll never find my name tag in time for inspection.
",3
6597,Patrick,58," Well, what did you do after I said hi to you this morning?
",3
6598,SpongeBob,58," Hmm, let's see. [imagines what he did today in his thought bubble] I skipped merrily to the Krusty Krab, said hello to Old Man Jenkins, placed an apple on Mr. Krabs' desk... and that's about it. Oh, and these two guys threw me in the dumpster. [cuts to SpongeBob being thrown into a dumpster by the Krusty Krab. He laughs] Good one, guys! [tries getting up but slips into the garbage again]
",3
6599,Patrick,58," That's it! Your name tag is in the apple on Mr. Krabs' desk!
",3
6600,SpongeBob,58," Patrick, you're a genius. Oh wait, he's probably thrown it away by now.
",3
6601,Patrick,58," Well, then we'll look in the dumpster! [cuts to the dumpster outside the Krusty Krab]
",3
6602,SpongeBob,58," Eh, what is that stench?
",3
6603,Patrick,58," That is the stench of discovery. Come on, buddy. I'll give you a boost. [gets on all fours] Hop on, pal.
",3
6604,SpongeBob,58," [jumps in the dumpster] Hey, it's not so bad once you get used to it.
",3
6605,Patrick,58," I wish I had a nose.
",3
6606,SpongeBob,58," Come on in, buddy. The garbage is fine.
",3
6607,Patrick,58," Cannonball! [does a cannonball]
",3
6608,SpongeBob,58," You look over there and I'll look over here.
",3
6609,Patrick,58," Okay. [digs through the trash while throwing some on SpongeBob]
",3
6610,SpongeBob,58," Patrick?
",3
6611,Patrick,58," I'm looking. I'm looking.
",3
6612,SpongeBob,58," Patrick? Patrick?
",3
6613,Patrick,58," I'm looking as fast as I can.
",3
6614,SpongeBob,58," Patrick! [Patrick stops and turns around to see SpongeBob covered in garbage] Thank you. [Patrick pulls trash off of SpongeBob]
",3
6615,Patrick,58," Here, let me get that. Hey, look! A Stingray 5000 single. Hey, these guys rock. Why would anybody throw this away?
",3
6616,SpongeBob,58," Have you forgotten what we're looking for knee-deep in yesterday's Top 40 songs?
",3
6617,Patrick,58," Yes.
",3
6618,Patrick,58," Could I have another hint?
",3
6619,SpongeBob,58," Patrick, I would love to sit here and play Twenty Questions with you, but I've only got [looks at his watch] one minute till inspection. [screams] One minute?! [digs quicker] Hurry, Patrick, we don't have much time.
",3
6620,Patrick,58," [notices a name tag on the back of SpongeBob's shirt] Hey, SpongeBob...
",3
6621,SpongeBob,58," Not now, Patrick.
",3
6622,Patrick,58," I know where your name tag is. [SpongeBob turns around]
",3
6623,SpongeBob,58," Where?! Where?!
",3
6624,Patrick,58," Uh... I can't remember.
",3
6625,SpongeBob,58," Patrick, I don't have time for this! [turns back around]
",3
6626,Patrick,58," There it is!
",3
6627,SpongeBob,58," Where?!
",3
6628,Patrick,58," Uh... I forgot again.
",3
6629,SpongeBob,58," Patrick, are you with me or against me?
",3
6630,Patrick,58," Could you give me a hint? [SpongeBob turns back around] There! I see it!
",3
6631,SpongeBob,58," Yeah, yeah, yeah... the boy who cried name tag. If you're not going to help me, then just go crawl back under your rock.
",3
6632,Patrick,58," [annoyed] Well, at least I don't wear my shirt backwards.
",3
6633,SpongeBob,58," My shirt backward... What the...? [bends his head back to his back] My shirt's on backwards! I had my identity all along. [spins his shirt around and looks at his watch] Oh, and just in time. Thanks, Patrick. [shakes hands with Patrick]
",3
6634,Patrick,58," Don't mention it, buddy. [cuts to the Krusty Krab]
",3
6635,Mr. Krabs,58," Fall in for inspection! All right, you two... [inspects Squidward] Hat and uniform seem to be in order. [notices a few hairs in Squidward's nose] Hmm, promise me you'll shave tonight and you pass.
",3
6636,Squidward,58," Hoorah.
",3
6637,Mr. Krabs,58," Okay, boy, your turn.
",3
6638,SpongeBob,58," [salutes] I think you'll find everything shipshape.
",3
6639,Mr. Krabs,58," [sniffs SpongeBob] Jumpin' jellyfish! What's that stench?
",3
6640,SpongeBob,58," Uh... discovery? [Mr. Krabs picks up SpongeBob and sets him outside. Flashback ends and cuts back to the diner] And that's how I got my identity back. Well, that's my story. [Ted yawns while the waitress checks her watch]
",3
6641,Waitress,58," Well, you managed to kill eleven minutes.
",3
6642,SpongeBob,58," [laughs] Thanks, uh... [looks at her name tag] Betty.
",3
6643,Waitress,58," What? [looks down at her name tag] Oh, sweetie, I'm not Betty. I just borrowed her uniform while mine's at the cleaners.",3

6650,French Narrator,59," Last week, a never-before-seen episode of SpongeBob SquarePants was discovered under a desk at Nickelodeon Studios. [a large crowd of excited people is shown] Now all the world is waiting in fevered anticipation to watch... [the title appears on screen] the SpongeBob SquarePants Lost Episode! [an aerial shot of the town of Encino appears] Now, to present the Lost Episode, from Encino, California, the president of the SpongeBob SquarePants fan club, Patchy the Pirate!

6655,Children,59," [off-screen] No, Patchy! Please! Don't say that, Patchy! Please!

6656,Patchy,59," But it is! It's lost and I have no idea where it is, so it's best if you forget all about old SpongeBob. [shuts the curtain and cries loudly. cuts to a montage of SpongeBob's greatest moments]

6658,Patchy,59," I don't believe I lost the Lost Episode. [screws in his peg leg] I never lose anything.

6659,Potty,59," What about your leg?
",3
6660,Patchy,59," Well, yeah, but...
",3
6661,Potty,59," And your eye.
",3
6662,Patchy,59," Well, the eye, I...
",3
6663,Potty,59," And your hand.
",3
6664,Patchy,59," And the h... oh, get out of here you blasted bird! [shoos Potty away] Hmm... if only I had a map to tell me where the Lost Episode is. [a screeching car sounds and a brick flies through the window and hits Potty; he mutters gibberish and then falls over]
",3
6665,Potty,59," What is it? Brawk!
",3
6666,Patchy,59," Hey... it's a map! It's a map to the Lost Episode of SpongeBob I lost!

6667,Potty,59," It's a dream come true!
",3
6668,Patchy,59," [giggles] We gotta go find it, Potty! [shouts excitedly and runs over to the door; snaps] Oh, first I'll need me treasure hunting leg. [grabs a black boot out of a bin of umbrellas and screws it on his wooden leg while limping out the door; it now functions like a normal leg] Come on, Potty! Ah! Times a-wastin'! [runs down the steps, along with Potty]
",3
6669,Potty,59," Brawk!
",3
6670,Patchy,59," [an elderly woman sits on her porch, knitting] Ten paces past Mrs. Johnson's house. [walks past the woman's house]
",3
6671,Mrs. Johnson,59," Would you boys like some cookies?
",3
6672,Patchy,59," Put 'em in a doggie bag, Mrs. Johnson. Can't right now, we're on a treasure hunt. [continues walking]
",3
6673,Mrs. Johnson,59," Okay, don't catch a cold.
",3
6674,Patchy,59," Walk five fathoms past Don's Import Store and Delicatessen. [looks up at a store by that name; walks next to a tree] Half a league to the forked tree. [looks up at a tree with plastic forks growing on it] Oh! [stands somewhere else, looking at the map] Now all that's left is... Huh?! The seven trials of monkey lagoon?! [lowers the map and sees a playground full of children] Merciful Neptune. Only for SpongeBob. Only for SpongeBob! [runs into the playground; rides back and forth on a small green horse and screams] Whoa! [goes up and down on a see-saw] Whoa! Whoa! [slides down a slide with his hands up; screams and hits the ground] Ow! [gets spun around on a merry-go-round and screams; he then slowly climbs on the monkey bars while a little kid punches him in the back] Ahh... Ahh... Ah! [inside a giant climbing thing while a group of kids laugh at him and finally he screams while he gets pushed on the swing by a little girl and then screams as the swing he was on returns with only a hook attached to it; the little girl stares at it, confused and then cuts to Patchy digging in the sand] We made it! We survived the trials! Oh, I'm really gonna dig this lost episode! [laughs] Dig it, get it? [laughs some more]

6675,Potty,59," [covered in sand] You stink!
",3
6676,Patchy,59," And I just got out of the shower. [laughs again; sticks his shovel in the ground and hits something] Hey Potty, I think I hit something. [camera zooms out; a large treasure chest sits in the sand] Clever... bury your treasure above the surface.
",3
6677,Potty,59," Brawk!
",3
6678,Patchy,59," [opens the chest; a golden glow shines from it] This is it! [a man in a construction hat sits in the chest, holding a tape; Patchy takes it; the man cups his hands] I don't know what it means either. [slams the top of the chest on the man] But I got what I came for! Come on Potty, time's a-wastin'. [runs off, jumping around and shouting excitedly again; runs into his house, still excited, and holds the tape up] Yeah! Popcorn. [slams a bag of popcorn down on the table] Soda. [puts a cup of soda on the table] Pickled garlic! [puts a jar of pickled garlic down on the table, next to the other things; runs and sits down] Potty, hit the remote!

6679,Potty,59," [drops an egg that hits the remote] Brawk! [the VCR turns on]
",3
6680,Patchy,59," [grabs the popcorn] This is gonna be great! [a countdown, starting at ten, appears on the screen] I can't believe it. More SpongeBob! [starts eating the popcorn; the countdown makes it's way down to five] This is so exciting! [laughs, shaking the popcorn, which flies everywhere; the countdown ends] Here it comes!
",3
6681,Potty,59," Brawk! Pipe down!

6682,Patchy,59," That's it? That's the Lost Episode? That was just a bunch of cheap walk cycles!

6683,Potty,59," What a rip!

6684,Patchy,59," Grrrrr... [his face turns red and smoke steams out of his ears] SpongeBob betrayed us?! [runs over to a wall of framed SpongeBob pictures; begins tearing them off the wall] I'm sorry I ever started this stupid fan club in the first place! [enters his SpongeBob merchandise filled room and starts throwing things everywhere] I'm gonna get rid of all my SpongeBob stuff! All of it! All of it! [rips his SpongeBob boxers out of his pants] All of it! [runs to the door] I'm gonna run away, that's what I'll do! Run away! [runs out the door crying]
",3
6685,Potty,59," Sheesh, what a hothead!
",3
6686,Announcer,59," [on TV, another countdown has started at twenty-three seconds with the words ""SpongeBob SquarePants Episode 118 The Real Lost Episode""] And now, the real Lost Episode!

6687,Potty,59," Brawk! Patchy, come back! There's more!
",3
6688,Patchy,59," [opens the door] Really? [shuts the door, then reenters again, quickly reversing what he did earlier to get back his SpongeBob stuff; sits back down] Hooray! Let's watch!
",3
6689,French Narrator,59," Here we see the proud jellyfish hunter. [SpongeBob stands completely still at the top of a hill, holding his net] He stands motionless to lure the jellyfish into a false sense of security. [a jellyfish swims right be him] And when his prey ventures to close, he springs into action.
",3
6690,SpongeBob,59," [puts on his safety glasses; turns into a spring and bounces after the jellyfish; stops in midair and looks down] Huh? [stretches out and starts falling downward, now in normal form] [screams and hits the ground] Ooh! [separates into seven smaller SpongeBob's, who all run away and then join back together, except for one, which SpongeBob catches and places in an open space on his backside; wipes the sweat off his forehead] Phew! I salute you, oh majestic jellyfish. [salutes a jellyfish that buzzes over his head] Your command of the sky is unmatched. Floating just out of the reach of my net, but near enough that I can see your untamed beauty. [a jellyfish floats up and down above SpongeBob's palm; music begins to play as a microphone lowers in front of him; he clears his throat] ♪If only I could join you there in the air. Floating free without a care. I wish I could fly. And see things with a different eye.♪ [SpongeBob's two eyes combine into one big eye; the camera zooms into it and his pupil becomes him flying through the sky] ♪I would fly so very high and touch the sky.♪ [flies through a crowd] ♪And never have to ask why it is that I can't fly♪ [the blue sky backdrop turn back into Jellyfish Fields, and SpongeBob falls to the ground; he gets up] Wait a minute, I'm forgetting the words of Grandpa SquarePants. [a thought cloud appears above SpongeBob's head; SpongeBob's grandfather is inside of it]
",3
6691,Grandpa SquarePants,59," If we were meant to fly, we'd have propellers on our heads or jet engines on our backs. [the cloud disappears]
",3
6692,SpongeBob,59," [snaps] I'm gonna follow his advice, by gum. I'll invent a flying machine! [cuts to SpongeBob working on building a plane outside of a barn; Patrick walks up to him]
",3
6693,Patrick,59," What's that contraption, SpongeBob?
",3
6694,SpongeBob,59," That, Patrick, is a flying machine.
",3
6695,Patrick,59," [laughs]
",3
6696,SpongeBob,59," What's so funny?
",3
6697,Patrick,59," Well, it's like my grandpa used to say. [a thought cloud appears over his head; Grandpa SquarePants is inside it again]
",3
6698,Grandpa SquarePants,59," If we were meant to fly, uh... hey, I'm not your grandfather! [pokes Patrick in the head with his cane; the thought cloud disappears]
",3
6699,SpongeBob,59," Well, here I go, Patrick! [runs to the front] I'm off to fly with the jellyfish! Ignition, check! [spins the propeller around] Landing gear... [kicks the tire] check! Complimentary peanuts... [holds up a bag of peanuts] check-a-roo. [hops into the cockpit, now with a hat and glasses on] Ready for takeoff! [pushes a handle forward; the plane starts up, then comes to pieces; the propeller spins through the air and slices through a grain silo next to the farm; sand pours out of it and covers him and Patrick]
",3
6700,Patrick,59," You cut a hole in Farmer Jenkins' grain silo!
",3
6701,SpongeBob,59," Don't remind me.
",3
6702,Jenkins,59," [runs up] I knew no good would come from city folk and their flying machines! Now git! [Patrick and SpongeBob run away]
",3
6703,Patrick,59," We better do what he says. He knows how to grow food! [cuts to Patrick standing in front of his rock, looking dumb; SpongeBob runs up with blueprints in his hand]
",3
6704,SpongeBob,59," Well, it took me all night, but here they are. The new blueprints! I wasn't even close with that last one. Propellers, rudders... [blows raspberries; cuts to him standing on the top of a cliff in a rubbery bat costume] This one's gonna fly! [stretches out the wings; the camera focuses on SpongeBob's butt, which is sticking out more than ever] I can feel it. Ready, Patrick?
",3
6705,Patrick,59," [at the bottom of the cliff] Ready!
",3
6706,SpongeBob,59," [jumps and starts flapping his wings; starts gasping] It's working, Patrick! I'm flying! I'm... [ceases to fly] falling! [hits the ground] Ooh! [Patrick runs over and sprays him with a fire extinguisher; cuts to SpongeBob, holding a clipboard, and Patrick, walking]
",3
6707,SpongeBob,59," This is it, Patrick. The physics are all here. This time, I'm gonna fly! [walks up to a lawn chair with two balloons attached to it and a brick sitting on it]
",3
6708,Patrick,59," Oh boy, a birthday party!
",3
6709,SpongeBob,59," [laughs] No, Patrick. This is the SquarePants Flyer Mark Three. [goes over and picks up the brick] All you do is remove the brick, or ballast, and... [turns around and realizes that his invention is no longer there] Huh? [looks up and sees it flying away] Well, back to the drawing board.
",3
6710,Patrick,59," Can we have the cake now? [singing] Happy, happy birthday to you! [cuts to SpongeBob, attached to a red kite, which is attached to a bicycle that Patrick is on]
",3
6711,SpongeBob,59," Patrick, get ready to say ""Eureka!""
",3
6712,Patrick,59," Okay!
",3
6713,SpongeBob,59," Go! [Patrick starts pedaling; SpongeBob lifts up off the bucket he is standing on and flies through the air] It's working! I'm flying! [flies past three fish on the side of the road]
",3
6714,Cap Fish,59," Hey! Look at that guy tied to a kite!
",3
6715,Fred,59," Why's he doing that?
",3
6716,Nancy,59," Oh my goodness...
",3
6717,Fred,59," Why's he doing that?
",3
6718,Cap Fish,59," He'll fall and break his...
",3
6719,Nancy,59," Can you see from up there?
",3
6720,SpongeBob,59," Do not be afraid, earthbound people. I am not a flying monster, I am just one of you. [suddenly, the kite snaps on him and falls out of the sky] D'oh! [Patrick keeps pedaling as SpongeBob repeatedly hits the ground behind him] Ow! Patrick! Ow! Patrick! Ow! Patrick! Ow! Patrick! [the three fish crack up; cuts to the Barg'n-Mart; SpongeBob is standing at the cash register in front of Vendor; he puts the shredded kite on the counter] Excuse me, sir, but I would like to return this kite.
",3
6721,Vendor,59," Hey... I know you. Yeah, from today's paper! [holds up a newspaper with a picture of SpongeBob on the front page and the headline ""Local Nutcase Tries to Fly""]
",3
6722,SpongeBob,59," ""Local nutcase tries to fly""?! I'm a nutcase because I follow my dreams? Well, they laughed at the guy who invented light bulbs too!
",3
6723,Vendor,59," No they didn't.
",3
6724,SpongeBob,59," [raises his fist] You'll see. [walks outside, and past Monroe and his mother]
",3
6725,Monroe,59," Look mom, it's the Bird Man of Bikini Bottom.
",3
6726,Mable,59," Wow! I wonder why he's still using his legs.
",3
6727,Monroe,59," Come on, Bird Man. Flap your wings and fly! [makes flapping motions; he and his mother laugh cruelly; SpongeBob walks away, only to encounter many other fish]
",3
6728,Cap Fish,59," Hey, Bird Man, going to check on your eggs?
",3
6729,Nancy,59," Maybe he's looking for a statue to poop on.
",3
6730,Fred,59," [steps in front of SpongeBob and starts flapping his arms and making chicken noises; a crowd of fish around him laughs]
",3
6731,SpongeBob,59," Go on and laugh, but it is a sad day in Bikini Bottom when a guy is ridiculed for having dreams! [two fish holding babies stand to the side of him]
",3
6732,Mother #2,59," You think you're the only one with unfulfilled dreams?
",3
6733,Stubble Fish,59," I was supposed to be a concert pianist... until I realized I didn't have any fingers. [looks at his hands]
",3
6734,Nat,59," We all had dreams.
",3
6735,Nancy,59," What makes you so special? [the crowd of fish turns into an angry mob, along with pitchfork and torches]
",3
6736,Mob,59," Let's get him!
",3
6737,SpongeBob,59," [the mob chases him; he starts panting, then stops] Huh? [camera zooms out to reveal SpongeBob just stepped off the edge of a cliff and he screams]
",3
6738,Nat,59," Good riddance, dreamer!
",3
6739,SpongeBob,59," [screams as he lands in a Mud Removal truck] Ooh! [the truck makes a sharp turn and SpongeBob falls out, covered in mud; while falling] Well, it can't get any worse. D'oh! [lands in a Feather Delivery truck; sticks his head up, which is now covered with feathers] I guess I spoke too soon.
",3
6740,French Narrator,59," [television version only] [the scene freezes] Will SpongeBob learn to fly? Stay tuned. [fade to black.]
",3
6741,SpongeBob,59," There they go again, Gary. [sighs] I suppose I'll never join them in the sky. I'll be stuck on the ground, sentenced to a flightless life. [takes off his towel, under which is his underwear, and tosses it away] Oh well. I guess all dreams aren't meant to come true. [grabs his pants and puts them on] Back to reality. [walks over to the sink; Gary follows]
",3
6742,Gary,59," Meow.
",3
6743,SpongeBob,59," No, Gary, my dreams are silly. [takes the towel off of his head; grabs a comb and blow-dryer and starts brushing and drying his spongy hair; the phone rings; he sticks the blow-dryer partially in his pants and answers the phone] Hello? No, this isn't the Bird Man of Bikini Bottom. What? [the blow-dryer starts to inflate his pants] No, I certainly do not live in a birdcage. Who is this? Joe Momma? Well, listen up, Joe. [Gary retreats inside his shell] I hate to break it to you, but flying is impossible. [floats upward and hits the ceiling] I have to go now. My head just hit the ceiling. Huh? Hey! Look, Gary! [pulls the blow-dryer out of his pants] I... I think I'm flying! Jellyfish Fields, here I come! [the top half of his pineapple opens up and he flies out of it]

6744,Monroe,59," [points] Mom, look! It's the flying guy!

6809,Monroe,59," Hey! There he is!
",3
6810,SpongeBob,59," [flies faster]
",3
6811,Monroe,59," He's getting away!
",3
6812,Light Purple Fish,59," No! He owes us favors!
",3
6813,Monroe,59," Get him! [the angry crowd chases after him, into Downtown Bikini Bottom; while SpongeBob flies past the buildings in a straight line, the crowd runs up and down each building; they stop at a cliff, before Jellyfish Fields; SpongeBob keeps flying]
",3
6814,SpongeBob,59," I'm almost at Jellyfish Fields. I'm gonna make it!
",3
6815,Nat,59," He's headed for Jellyfish Fields! We'll Never catch him now!
",3
6816,Jenkins,59," [off-screen] I'll take care of this!
",3
6817,Crowd,59," It's Cannonball Jenkins!
",3
6818,Jenkins,59," [inside a lit cannon, wearing a red helmet and suit; launches out of the cannon and toward SpongeBob; he collides with him, and SpongeBob's inflatable pants explode; the two hurtle toward the ground; SpongeBob falls even further as Cannonball Jenkins opens up a red parachute] I told you nothing good would come from city folk and their flying machines! [the crowd watches as SpongeBob crashes to the ground; they walk over]
",3
6819,Fred,59," What have we done? [starts to cry] Come on, everybody! I think a proper burial is in order. [picks up the pants] A pair of pants like these come around... once in a lifetime. [the crowd leaves; SpongeBob, now in his underwear, regains consciousness]
",3
6820,SpongeBob,59," Well, it was fun while it lasted. [walks up to Jellyfish Fields, then walks away] I guess I'm not meant to fly after all. [sighs; starts to raise up in the air; a group of jellyfish are below him, carrying him up] Huh? Hey! My jellyfish friends are helping me fly! Without pants! I guess it just goes to show... [the jellyfish carry him back to Bikini Bottom] ♪You don't need a plane to fly♪ [Johnson looks out the window at him] ♪Plastic wings may make you cry♪ [a flock of scallops fly by] ♪Kites are made for windy days. Lawn chair with balloons... fly away♪ [the crowd of fish bury SpongeBob's pants as the mourn over them] ♪Inflatable pants... you may as well skip!♪ [arrives at his home; the jellyfish put him back on the ground] ♪If you want to fly, all you need... is friendship. Yeah.♪ [the jellyfish buzz away; waves] Goodbye, jellies! You taught me a valuable lesson. Although I'm not quite sure what it was.
",3
6821,Patrick,59," [walks up] Hey! Let's fly down to the pizza house for a slice.
",3
6822,SpongeBob,59," No more flying for me, Patrick. I'll leave that to the jellyfish. [opens his door]
",3
6823,Patrick,59," Suit yourself. [lifts up his arm and flies away]
",3
6824,SpongeBob,59," [turns back around] Did Patrick just...? [laughs] Nah! [enters his house again, but opens the door one last time, just to make sure.]
",3
6825,Patchy,59," Wow! Wasn't that great, kids?
",3
6826,Potty,59," Let's watch it again.
",3
6827,Patchy,59," [chuckles] That's a great idea, Potty. [looks on the table] Where's the remote? [continues searching] Where's the remote? [stands up] Oh, I lost the remote! They should make those things... [a brick flies through the window and hits Patchy on the head] Eh... [falls to the floor]
",3
6828,Potty,59," Brawk!
",3
6829,Patchy,59," [stands back up and drops the brick on his foot; he is now holding his remote] My remote! [goes to the window] Thanks, stranger!
",3
6830,Mrs. Johnson,59," [outside, in a wheelchair] Don't mention it, Patchy! [flames shoot of the back of her wheelchair and she peels off, leaving a skid mark behind]
",3
6831,Patchy,59," Now, which one of these cockamamie buttons is rewind? [presses a button; a juggling clown appears on TV] No, that's not it. [presses another button; a weatherman appears on TV] D'oh! Wrong again. [keeps flipping through the channels and grunting; a black and white horse movie comes on, then a blob movie, then a football game, then the giraffe from Krusty Krab Training Video, then the anemone from Your Shoe's Untied then a Tyrannosaurus Rex battling a Triceratops; Potty flies over]
",3
6832,Potty,59," Brawk! Let me do it!
",3
6833,Patchy,59," No, get away! [the lights go out] That's the light switch! Give me that! [the lights turns back on; Patchy and Potty fight over the remote, until a mariachi band pops up from behind the couch]
",3
6834,Potty,59," Brawk! That's the mariachi band button!
",3
6835,Patchy,59," Grrrrr... I hate technology!
",3
6836,Patchy,59," [continues pressing buttons on the remote] Rewind... darn you! [suddenly, the VCR starts spitting out tape]
",3
6837,Potty,59," Brawk! Failure ahoy!
",3
6838,Patchy,59," No! [tries to stop the tape from spewing out] Dah! DAH! Oh, blasted infernal machine! [gets tangled up and falls over, still struggling] Oh no! I've ruined the lost episode! Now it's lost forever!
",3
6839,Potty,59," Brawk! Lost forever!
",3
6840,French Narrator,59," Oh boy, what a loser. Well, I guess the lost episode will remain lost. But, tape or no tape, as long as there are stars in the sky, SpongeBob will live on in our hearts and in our minds. [a SpongeBob constellation appears over Patchy's house] Now get lost. I mean, bye. No, really, get lost.",3

",3
6855,SpongeBob,60," Hold that thought, Squidward. I'm doing the parking lot for early morning litter patrol. May Neptune shine brightly on my harvest. [laughs. SpongeBob walks out with a bag and a long, pointy tool] Litter. [picks up trash] Looks like someone missed the trash basket, huh, Mr. Candy Wrapper? [laughs] Kids these days. [another piece of trash falls to the ground next to him] I've never seen such an epidemic! Well, at least it's all over now. [more trash keeps falling to the ground around him and he picks them up quickly. He breathes, exhausted, as one more piece of litter falls down attached to a parachute.] Where is that litter coming from?! [SpongeBob notices someone tossing trash out of a car] Not on my watch. [walks up to the car] Sir, I will have you know it's against the law to litter.
",3
6856,Strangler,60," Heh, what're you gonna do, call the police? [police arrive]
",3
6857,SpongeBob,60," Yes. [police begin to handcuff the Strangler. They walk past him in single-file and continue cuffing him]

6864,Squidward,60," The Tattletale Strangler! [shows SpongeBob a 'WANTED' poster of the Strangler] He's promised to strangle anyone who turns him in. [Strangler growls]
",3
6865,SpongeBob,60," He seems kind of angry with us, eh, Squidward? [SpongeBob notices Squidward is gone] Squidward? Squidward?
",3
6866,Officer Malley,60," You're gonna do time, Strangler. Hard time. [SpongeBob walks up to the police]

",3
6872,Officer Nancy,60," Don't worry, SpongeBob. He won't be able to strangle you.
",3
6873,Officer Malley,60," Yeah. We got him chained up real good. He'll never get away.
",3
6874,Officer Nancy,60," Oops, not again. [Strangler is gone, with his handcuffs in his place in the car]
",3
6875,Officer Malley,60," Yep, he got away. [SpongeBob screams then walks up to the police]
",3
6876,SpongeBob,60," You nice officers will protect me, right?
",3
6877,Officer Nancy,60," We ain't bodyguards, kid.
",3
6878,Officer Malley,60," Yeah, give us a call if you see him again... tattletale. [they drive off]
",3
6879,SpongeBob,60," Those officers are right. I need a bodyguard! [runs into the Krusty Krab] Mr. Krabs! There's a maniac after me! I need a bodyguard.
",3
6880,Mr. Krabs,60," [laughs] I wasn't five-time 'Golden Claws' in the navy for nothin'! When he sees me moves, he'll be running scared. So, where is this little bully? Down at the park? The sodey shop? What does he look like, eh, boy?
",3
6881,SpongeBob,60," This would be him, Mr. Krabs. [takes out the wanted poster of The Strangler]
",3
6882,Mr. Krabs,60," [screams] The Tattletale Strangler? [his eyes go into his body] Go away, SpongeBob! Take your death cloud with you! [scene cuts to SpongeBob showing the wanted poster to people. Shows it to Larry, who turns into a real lobster on a plate, then a construction worker who pogos off on his jackhammer, and some guys at the Tough Tavern who run off, some screaming ""HOLD ME! HOLD ME!"", leaving SpongeBob distraught]
",3
6883,SpongeBob,60," [at the bus stop] Ugh, that's it. I gotta get out of town 'til I can find a bodyguard. [Strangler sits on a bench reading a newspaper]
",3
6884,Strangler,60," Bodyguard, huh? I might be able to help you out. [SpongeBob walks over]
",3
6885,SpongeBob,60," You don't understand, mister. I need protection from the scariest guy in town. Here's his picture. [holds up the wanted poster. The Strangler reveals himself wearing a fake mustache]
",3
6886,Strangler,60," Heh heh, he doesn't look so tough.
",3
6887,SpongeBob,60," I tattled on him, and now he wants to strangle me with his diabolical hands! I hope they're not dirty. [Strangler shows his filthy hands and laughs. Before the Strangler starts to strangle SpongeBob, a bus stops next to them and the Strangler puts his hands behind his back and smiles, as the bus drives off]
",3
6888,Strangler,60," Huh? Uh-oh. Uhh, there's too many witnesses around here. [walks up to SpongeBob] Listen, kid. I could be your bodyguard. Here's my card. [Shows SpongeBob his drawn-over fake ID card]
",3
6889,SpongeBob,60," Hmm, looks good to me. You're hired! I feel safer already. What's next? [a five cent sticker is hanging from the Strangler's fake mustache]
",3
6890,Strangler,60," Well, the maniac could be anywhere, wearing a disguise. He could be that old man. [he points to an old man with a walker] Or that baby. [points to a baby in a stroller]
",3
6891,SpongeBob,60," Or that pebble. [points to a small rock on the ground] Or that stick. [points to a stick on the ground] Or that receipt for the Phony Baloney Mustache Emporium! [points to a white piece of paper]
",3
6892,Strangler,60," Huh? Uhh, that's mine. [picks it up and puts it in his pocket]
",3
6893,SpongeBob,60," Oh, bodyguard, my body is in your guarding hands. What do we do first?
",3
6894,Strangler,60," Well, I suggest we go to a nice, quiet, secluded location, uh, like behind an old dumpster or a dark alley...
",3
6895,SpongeBob,60," We could go to my house and turn off all the lights!
",3
6896,Strangler,60," Perfect. That way no one can hear you being strangled... err, I mean, uhh, protected. [laughs as the lights grow dim] Perfect. [SpongeBob laughs until he turns the lights on again]
",3
6897,SpongeBob,60," Ah, but first I gotta do a few errands.
",3
6898,Strangler,60," Uhh, okay, but let's make it quick.
",3
6899,SpongeBob,60," Quick is my middle name! [scene cuts to the grocery store] Let's see...paper towels. This one says 'best paper towel around' this one says 'best paper towel in town'. Hmm... in town... around... in town... around... what do you think, bodyguard?
",3
6900,Strangler,60," Whatever gets us to your house quicker.
",3
6901,SpongeBob,60," I'll take both! [scene cuts to 'Dry Cleaning While-U-Wait']
",3
6902,Dry Cleaner,60," Here you go, Mr. SquarePants. [he hands him his clothes]
",3
6903,SpongeBob,60," Hmmm.
",3
6904,Dry Cleaner,60," Is there something wrong?
",3
6905,SpongeBob,60," I'm not sure if these are my pants. [scene cuts to the perfume store where SpongeBob sprays some perfume on his wrist and holds it up to the Strangler] How about this one, bodyguard? Too overbearing?
",3
6906,Strangler,60," Can we just go to your house?! [scene cuts to SpongeBob's house]
",3
6907,SpongeBob,60," Here we are. SquarePants Manor! Bodyguard, let me just take this opportunity to say you're the best bodyguard a fella could hope to have.
",3
6908,Strangler,60," All right, enough of the sappy talk! Open the door so I can strangle you... I mean, uhh, choke you... I mean, uhh, crush your windpipe... gah, I mean...
",3
6909,SpongeBob,60," Protect me?
",3
6910,Strangler,60," Thanks.
",3
6911,Narrator,60," Twenty minutes later... [SpongeBob is still searching for his key. The Strangler gets even more angry.]
",3
6912,SpongeBob,60," Well, I can't find 'em. You wanna take a look?
",3
6913,Strangler,60," Forget the key! Let's climb through this window. [struggles reaching for the window] I can't reach it. Do you think you could hop up on my shoulders, kid?  [SpongeBob is wearing cleats]
",3
6914,SpongeBob,60," Sure! With these spiky cleats, anything is possible! [jumps onto the Strangler] Ya!
",3
6915,Strangler,60," Cleats?! [SpongeBob's feet land on the Strangler's eyeballs. The Strangler screams in pain] Get your feet out of my eye sockets! [SpongeBob starts tugging at his legs]
",3
6916,SpongeBob,60," I'm trying, but my cleats are stuck in your corneas! [Strangler runs around in pain]
",3
6917,Narrator,60," Six hours later... [Strangler is still running around until he pulls SpongeBob's feet out of his eyes. Scene cuts to the Strangler with bandages on his eyes]
",3
6918,SpongeBob,60," Don't be mad, bodyguard. Let me just grab the key I keep under the mat and we can get inside. [The Strangler's eyes open widely. The Strangler growls in anger and a nuclear explosion comes out of his head] There you are, you little rascal. Now, to put the key in the lock, which should activate the tumblers, thus opening the door. [Strangler sneaks up behind SpongeBob ready to strangle him. SpongeBob opens the door and walks in] Step inside...
",3
6919,Strangler,60," [closes the door] Close the door...
",3
6920,SpongeBob,60," Well, here we are!
",3
6921,Strangler,60," I've finally got you all alone! [laughs evilly]
",3
6922,SpongeBob,60," I know, Isn't it great? [laughs. Strangler picks up SpongeBob] Ooh.
",3
6923,Strangler,60," Now you're gonna get yours... tattletale! [lights turn on]
",3
6924,All of SpongeBob's friends,60," Surprise! [all of SpongeBob's friends are in his house cheering. They drop a sign that says 'Congratulations, SpongeBob! 100% On Time!']
",3
6925,SpongeBob,60," A surprise party to celebrate my perfect on-time percentage at work? Oh, how'd you guys know?
",3
6926,Patrick,60," It's on the invitations you sent us. [holds an invitation up] Let's boogie! [everyone parties. The Strangler sits down in SpongeBob's chair. Scene cuts to the end of the party]
",3
6927,SpongeBob,60," Bye, everybody, thanks for coming! Bye Mr. Krabs, bye Plankton, bye Sandy, bye Larry, bye Pearl, bye Mrs. Puff, bye Squidward, bye eh the rest [everyone else leaves and he walks back into the house and laughs] Ahh, alone at last.
",3
6928,Strangler,60," What? Huh? Huh? What? Huh? [SpongeBob closes the door] So, we're all alone now?
",3
6929,SpongeBob,60," Just you, me, and the floorboards. [Strangler and SpongeBob begin laughing again] Yeah. [there's a knock on the door. SpongeBob opens it]
",3
6930,All,60," Happy birthday, SpongeBob!
",3
6931,SpongeBob,60," How did you guys know today is my birthday?
",3
6932,Patrick,60," We just do what the invitations say. Let's boogie some more! [everyone parties again. Scene cuts to end of party]
",3
6933,SpongeBob,60," Thanks for coming! [closes the door] [laughs] Alone again.
",3
6934,Strangler,60," Is it true? Everybody's gone?
",3
6935,SpongeBob,60," Uh-huh.
",3
6936,Strangler,60," No more parties today? You got everything you need now? Everybody's left? We're completely alone?
",3
6937,SpongeBob,60," Oh yeah.
",3
6938,Strangler,60," In that case... [laughs evilly until Patrick appears out of nowhere]
",3
6939,Patrick,60," Great parties, huh?
",3
6940,Strangler,60," Oh... sorry, Tubby, you've gotta go.
",3
6941,SpongeBob,60," Wait! We can trust Patrick. He's my best friend.
",3
6942,Strangler,60," Well, I can't take any chances. For all we know, he could be the Strangler.
",3
6943,Patrick,60," I'm the Strangler? Oh, I should've known! I gotta turn myself in! [runs and breaks through the wall]
",3
6944,SpongeBob,60," So, Patrick's the Strangler. Gee, you think you know a guy.
",3
6945,Strangler,60," [growls] He's not the strangler!
",3
6946,SpongeBob,60," He's not?
",3
6947,Strangler,60," [rips off his fake mustache] I am!
",3
6948,SpongeBob,60," Hey, how'd you do that without shaving cream?
",3
6949,Strangler,60," Oh, it's a fake, you idiot! I bought it at the party store! [everyone comes back inside]
",3
6950,Squidward,60," Did someone say 'party'? [Strangler screams and runs out through the wall]
",3
6951,Strangler,60," I can't take it!
",3
6952,SpongeBob,60," [runs after him] Wait, bodyguard, I need protection! [Strangler gets into a taxi]
",3
6953,Strangler,60," Step on it! I'm being chased by a maniac! [SpongeBob chases after the taxi]
",3
6954,SpongeBob,60," I'm not safe! Come back! [taxi goes to the Bikini Bottom Airport and an airplane takes off]
",3
6955,Strangler,60," Finally, away from that guy.
",3
6956,SpongeBob,60," [on the airplane a row behind Strangler] Good idea, bodyguard. He'll never find us up here. [Strangler jumps out of the plane screaming, he opens his parachute, but it is actually SpongeBob] Good thinking, bodyguard. The Strangler could have been on that plane. [Strangler takes out a giant pair of scissors and cuts the strings off the SpongeBob parachute and plummets right into the Bikini Bottom Police Station jail. SpongeBob comes running up to him] Bodyguard, bodyguard!
",3
6957,Strangler,60," Look, kid... I'm not your bodyguard! [cries] I'm the Strangler! See?! [looks toward his 'WANTED' poster on the wall]
",3
6958,SpongeBob,60," [gasps] The Strangler! [police officers walk up]
",3
6959,Officer Nancy,60," Good work, SpongeBob. You put the Strangler behind bars.
",3
6960,Strangler,60," Well, at least I'm safe from that yellow idiot.
",3
6961,Patrick,60," Hey, Mac, [Strangler turns and sees Patrick in the cell with him] what're you in for?",3

",4
6976,SpongeBob,61," Did you hear that, Squidward? We get to keep working and working and working without ever having to go home! I've got to pinch myself, because I must be dreaming! [SpongeBob exits the punctured hole in the wall and stands flat on the floor. He starts pinching himself twice, then yells in pain. He pinches himself again and yells again, then does it four more times. After a brief pause, he pinches himself yet again] Well, I'm not dreaming. [Switch to a telescope view of the front window of the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs walks up to the sign and amends it to read, Open 24 hours!]
",4
6977,Plankton,61," [behind the scope] Open 24 hours, eh? I knew he couldn't resist staying open later than me. [He starts walking into the Chum Bucket] My evil plan is working perfectly. He'll run his employees into the ground, and when SpongeBob's mind finally cracks from exhaustion, I'll get him to tell me the secret Krabby Patty formula. [Laughs evilly. He notices after a while that his computer wife, Karen is not laughing with him] Why aren't you laughing?
",4
6978,Karen,61," I've heard this joke before. [Scene switches to the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is standing near the cash register with a bell and beater in hand]

6988,Mr. Krabs,61," You could learn a few things from that boy.
",4
6989,Squidward,61," [through his teeth] Mr. Krabs, he is not normal. [SpongeBob starts kissing a Krabby Patty]
",4
6990,Mr. Krabs,61," All right, you can sit down for five minutes. Then it's back to work. [Squidward drops over and starts snoring. Plankton, wearing a tight black suit descends from a rope on the wall and monitors at SpongeBob]
",4
6991,Plankton,61," Drats! He's not collapsing from exhaustion, but with a little more pressure, the Sponge will crack like an egg [clenches fist], and I'll be there to feast on the goo of his shattered psyche. [Slurps and then does an evil laugh. Mr. Krabs notices Plankton, but since he is tiny, black and suspending from a coil, he believes Plankton is a small insect]
",4
6992,Mr. Krabs,61," Eww! A spider bug. [Mr. Krabs squishes him and the scene changes to the Chum Bucket a while later. Plankton is on the phone, ordering an item from the Krusty Krab]
",4
6993,Plankton,61," Come on! [Mr. Krabs finally picks up on the other line]
",4
6994,Mr. Krabs,61," Krusty Krab! The restaurant that never closes. Would you like to place an order? [We hear a muffled sound from Mr. Krabs' phone] 10,000 Krabby Patties! We'll start your order right away, Mr...uh, uh...What was that name again? [Muffles coming from the phone. Mr. Krabs writes his information on a piece of paper] Uh huh...Peter Lankton. Wait a minute; this isn't some kind of prank, is it?
",4
6995,Plankton,61," Eh...no.
",4
6996,Mr. Krabs,61," Good! We'll call you when it's ready, Mr. Lankton. [Mr. Krabs bursts through the kitchen door, and starts yelling orders at SpongeBob]
",4
6997,Mr. Krabs,61," Kick it into high gear! We've got a big order! [Clutches SpongeBob, who is staring into space] I'm counting on you, boy. I need you to raise that spatular. [SpongeBob does so, enthusiastically] Yeah! And I need you to say, ""Team Krusty Krab!""
",4
6998,SpongeBob,61," Team Krusty Krab!
",4
6999,Mr. Krabs,61," That's me boy! Now, make me 10,000 Krabby Patties. [SpongeBob's eyes swell up as Mr. Krabs walks away] And no breaks!
",4
7000,SpongeBob,61," [Ecstatic, giggles] Did you hear that spatula? You, me and 10,000 Krabby Patties. And the best part? No breaks! [Pinches self] Wow! [Cut to a view of the ocean with a small island with some palm trees in the background]

7012,Squidward,61," [Breathing heavily next to a pile of Krabby Patties] 43...! [Gasps, as the top of his head expands and shrinks. SpongeBob places a tray of food items on the chef's window and then shoves them off. He does the same again for a smelly boot]
",4
7013,Mr. Krabs,61," What the flimflam? [Enters the kitchen and notices SpongeBob looking like a wreck] What are you doing in here, boy? You're wasting all me food. [SpongeBob does not answer him] Boy? [SpongeBob starts fighting the air with his spatula. Mr. Krabs hits him on the back of his head]

",4
7017,Mr. Krabs,61," Sure, I said I'm worried that... [He turns into a Krabby Patty again. He turns back into himself after he stops talking]

",4
7025,Mr. Krabs,61," [patting SpongeBob's head] There, there. I'm sure it's nothing that getting back to work won't solve. Here's your Spatular. [Hands SpongeBob his spatula]

",4
7029,Mr. Krabs,61," [Showing SpongeBob some patties in his hands] and here are some fresh Krabby... [SpongeBob starts screaming again. When Mr. Krabs pulls the patties away, SpongeBob's scream lessens. He pulls the patties out in front of him and continues pushing and pulling them forward]
",4
7030,Mr. Krabs,61," Hmm, there may be a problem after all.
",4
7031,SpongeBob,61," What does this mean?
",4
7032,Mr Krabs,61," It means there's something wrong with your head. Look, I think maybe you should see a professional.

7034,Mr. Krabs,61," No, a psychiatrist.
",4
7035,Plankton,61," Come in, Mr. SquarePants. Please have a seat on the couch. [SpongeBob sits on the couch. He turns his chair around so that we can see Plankton wearing a costume and beard] Now... [chuckles] Let's unload all that harmful information in your little yellow head.
",4
7036,SpongeBob,61," You're a bit smaller than I imagined, doctor, but I guess that's why they call you shrink [laughs]. Do you think there's hope for me, doctor?

7037,SpongeBob,61," Oh, good.

7038,Plankton,61," Let's start with a simple exercise.
",4
7039,SpongeBob,61," Jumping jacks?
",4
7040,Plankton,61," I want you to close your eyes. [SpongeBob lightly closes his eyes] Tighter [he closes his eyes tighter] Tighter [Tightens them even more, until the rip off] Too tight! Now, tell me what you see?
",4
7041,SpongeBob,61," I see giant Krabby Patties.
",4
7042,Plankton,61," Good, and what are they made of? [He starts recording on a voice recorder]
",4
7043,SpongeBob,61," Hatred!

7044,Plankton,61," No, I mean ingredients. What are the stinking ingredients?
",4
7045,SpongeBob,61," They're coming for me. No! No! No! Stay back! [ He produces a grand piano from nowhere and somehow holds it threateningly in the air]
",4
7046,Plankton,61," Wait, where'd you get that piano? [SpongeBob smashes Plankton with the piano. He groans. Later, he continues his psychology] We're trying something else. I'm going to say a word and I want you to say the first word that pops into your head. Ready?
",4
7047,SpongeBob,61," I'm ready!

7059,SpongeBob,61," Toh-mah-to [Scene switches to SpongeBob kneeling on the floor looking at various cards]
",4
7060,Plankton,61," I've laid out some words on cards here. These words are common kitchen ingredients. I want you to arrange them in any order you choose. It could be a poem or a secret formula. I don't know…oh yes! A secret formula. Good, let's do that.
",4
7061,SpongeBob,61," Um, you're making me nervous.
",4
7062,Plankton,61," Oh, o.k. [Walks to and sits on his chair] I'll be over here, then.
",4
7063,SpongeBob,61," I'm finished! [Plankton gets up and walks to SpongeBob] I've arranged them into a piano. [The piano falls on Plankton]
",4
7064,Plankton,61," Since your mind has been resistant to every mental technique so far, I'm forced to resort to my most powerful method of curing you.

7065,SpongeBob,61," Fiber?
",4
7066,Plankton,61," No, hypnosis.
",4
7067,SpongeBob,61," Hypnosis?!

7068,Plankton,61," [holds a ticking watch in front of him] Now, keep your eyes on this watch. [shakes it slowly] When I count to three, you will fall into a deep sleep. 1...uh, 2...uh, 3. [SpongeBob falls asleep and begins snoring very loudly] I can't believe it worked. Now, when I snap my fingers, you will awake and tell me the formula. [Snaps fingers, but SpongeBob continues snoring loudly. He snaps a couple more times] Hey, wake up! [He clashes cymbals, blows a trumpet and beats on drums, but SpongeBob continues snoring, even louder than the sounds] Hmm, what else is loud and obnoxious? [He holds a loud ringing cell phone up to his ear, but SpongeBob's snoring is even louder] Why won't you wake up?!
",4
7069,SpongeBob,61," Where am I? [Lights turn on and he is lying in his bed in his home. The door to his room opens and a huge Krabby Patty walks in]
",4
7070,Krabby Patty,61," Hey, SpongeBob. I heard your brain was sick, so I brought you this cookie pizza. [Hands SpongeBob a cookie pizza]
",4
7071,SpongeBob,61," Gee, thanks!

7072,Krabby Patty,61," And here's some chocolate milk. [Hands SpongeBob a glass of chocolate milk]
",4
7073,SpongeBob,61," The king of flavored dairy drinks! [He drinks it quickly] Oh, Krabby Patty, I'm so glad we're friends again.

7074,Krabby Patty,61," Just remember, SpongeBob, I'll always be with you right here [points to a part of SpongeBob's stomach] .
",4
7075,SpongeBob,61," In my heart?
",4
7076,Krabby Patty,61," Actually, in your arteries. Now, do me a favor and wake up. Wake up.
",4
7077,Plankton,61," [In real life, shouting into a loudspeaker] Wake up!
",4
7078,SpongeBob,61," [wakes up, yawning] It worked! I'm cured!
",4
7079,Plankton,61," But what about the formula.
",4
7080,SpongeBob,61," Oh, you're right! I'd better get back to work! [SpongeBob runs away, towards the Krusty Krab] Thanks for everything, doc!
",4
7081,Plankton,61," [yelling] No! It's a lie! Therapy doesn't really work. You're still sick! Very, very sick! [Scene cuts to the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob is flipping burgers normally]
",4
7082,Mr. Krabs,61," Good to see you're brain's all fixed, boy.
",4
7083,SpongeBob,61," Yeah, I just needed some sleep, is all.
",4
7084,Mr. Krabs,61," Well, I can safely say, ""No more 24 hour shifts"", because 23 hours will be plenty! [laughs]

7085,SpongeBob,61," Oh, Mr. Krabs...! [SpongeBob then starts laughing]

7086,Mr. Krabs,61," No, seriously. Get back to work!",4

7197,SpongeBob,62," Affirmative. Out. Oh, that's why he calls himself 'The Retriever'.
",4
7198,Patrick,62," Why are we called 'Worm-bait?'

7220,SpongeBob,62," Okay. [SpongeBob & Patrick jump out of the portable potty in steak costumes] Can you explain the plan again, Squidward?

7221,Squidward,62," Sure, but first, put on this cologne.
",4
7222,SpongeBob,62," [reads label] Steak sauce? [shrugs shoulders and puts the sauces on his body]
",4
7223,Squidward,62," Okay, so you are dressed as choice cuts. You go in there and yell ""Trick or treat!"" The worm will realize he forgot to stock up on Halloween candy, he'll leave to buy some then we take the mattress.

7296,Mr. Krabs,64," I took the liberty of turning your paycheck... [as he shows Squidward the bag of quarters] ...into quarters. Just in case you wanna... oh, I don't know, do laundry or [as he jiggles the bag] buy a soda or... something.

7297,Squidward,64," Very funny, Mr. Krabs. If I can't win one of those stupid things with this quarter, I'm walking away.

7299,SpongeBob,64," [Squidward sitting on ground with empty bag over head] Pardon me, Squidward. SpongeBear, Jr. here wants me to win him a little brother. [Squidward scoots to the side while SpongeBob inserts a coin into the machine]

",4
7301,Squidward,64," Huh?
",4
7302,SpongeBob,64," Two in one quarter? That's not fair. [puts in one of the prizes] What's that clown frown? Oh, you'd rather sit next to lovely lion? [takes the crane and moves the prizes around] There you are, nice and cozy. See ya later, Squidward.
",4
7303,Squidward,64," [scoots his way into his house and then sits on his couch and sighs] A little mind-numbing television ought to help me forget about that stupid machine. [tries to pick up the remote but every time he tries, he fails because of the crane coming into his mind. He then uses his eye instead to press a button on the remote] Yeeowwww! [he slides off the couch. Now he's in bed] You've had a rough day, Squiddie. But that doesn't mean tomorrow won't be better. [tries to pull his covers but he can't because of the crane coming into his mind] Oooh, phooey!! [he shivers for a few seconds, gets up and then tries to pick up the glass of water by his bed but drops it and breaks it] I gotta win that crane! [he runs through his closet door and gets the piggy bank, which cries a teardrop. He then runs to the Krusty Krab. Later, SpongeBob enters the Krusty Krab and freaks out at what he sees when he enters] Just once! Please, oh, please, let me win one time!
",4
7304,SpongeBob,64," Squid, I think you have a problem.
",4
7305,Mr. Krabs,64," No, he doesn't. You don't listen to him, Squidward. You keep playing until you win! [takes out all the quarters that were put in the machine and pours them into a bucket. A piece of rolled paper drops into the bucket] What's this?
",4
7306,Squidward,64," The deed to my house. 
",4
7307,Mr. Krabs,64," Okey-dokey, then. Carry on.
",4
7308,Squidward,64," [sobbing] If I can just win once, I'd never play again! [bawling]
",4
7309,SpongeBob,64," Hey, you want me to tell you the secret of how to win on this machine? 
",4
7310,Squidward,64," [gasps] SpongeBob, there's a secret? 
",4
7311,SpongeBob,64," Mm-hmm. 
",4
7312,Squidward,64," Tell me... [as his eyes get bigger] the... secret.

",4
7341,Mr. Krabs,64," That's funny. Last time I checked, you were a cashier. 
",4
7342,Squidward,64," Yuck it up all you want, Mr. Krabs. But just remember, you're yucking [looking] in the presence of a winner! [shoves the bear in his face] Ha! [runs out the door]
",4
7343,Mr. Krabs,64," I'll try to remember that. [as he counts all of Squidward's quarters] 3,498 of Squidward's quarters... 3,499 of Squidward's quarters.

7364,Construction Worker,64," You know this guy? 
",4
7365,SpongeBob,64," Yeah, that's Squidward. He's got the magic touch. [pokes the construction worker] Ding. [Squidward knocks a bunch of buildings over with the I-beam; a sign reads ""Your New Mall"". The construction worker is ready to explode] Tada! [notices the mess] Ah! Squidward, open your eyes! 
",4
7366,Squidward,64," [opens eyes] Oh, uhh, be the crane. Be the crane. [can't control crane; he whacks the workers with a beam] Look out, SpongeBob. I can't stop! [crane chases after SpongeBob & the workers; SpongeBob's eyes bug out so he runs away on them] Be the crane. Be the crane. Be the crane. Okay, don't be the crane! Don't be the crane! [Everybody runs in terror into the Krusty Krab. The crane spins around fast and heads towards the Krusty Krab and as the workers and SpongeBob duck, Squidward destroys it]

It's not about the mon... [suitcase full of money is shown to Mr. Krabs] Holy sweet mother of pearl! I like the way you think Blandy. But it's gonna take a lot more than a suitcase of cash to buy the Krusty Krab from me.

7395,Howard,65," Just one thing. If you can sign this contract. It just states that you relinquish the Krusty Krab and all proprietary ownership thereof. Along with its employees, merchandise, logos, and cash registers.

",4
7430,Squidward,65," Sincere service with a smile.
",4
7431,Carl,65," Well, yes, but with the Krabby O' Mondays spirit. Now, Squidward, you wouldn't want to have to talk to human resources... [big strong guy steps out] ...would you? So, what's our motto again?

7436,Mr. Krabs,65," Retirement ain't all it's cracked up to be. So, I'm the new bus boy. [whistles as he sees SpongeBob with a big smile] Uhh, ok son, you're starting to creep my out.

7437,SpongeBob,65," [clings to Mr. Krabs] I knew you'd come back, Mr. Krabs, I just knew you would.

7443,Squidward,65," Ahoy, Eugene! Would you mind clearing this table for me?

7444,Mr. Krabs,65," Sure, Squidward. Ya know, I've never seen you this happy.
",4
7445,Squidward,65," They're watching us.
",4
7446,Mr. Krabs,65," That guy's a real pain in the hindquarters, eh Squiddy?
",4
7447,Squidward,65," Uhh, Eugene, I think you need to look at page 20 of our employee handbook again.
",4
7448,Mr. Krabs,65," Oh, I don't need Carl's silly rules.

7449,Squidward,65," I really think you should look. [pointing to a message]

7450,Mr. Krabs,65," What's this? Help me.

7451,Carl,65," Hey, fellas, what's going on over here?
",4
7452,Squidward,65," Oh, hey Carl, uhh, I was just reminding Eugene about article 24 section 3 of our employee handbook.
",4
7453,Carl,65," Cut the chatter, and pick up the platter! Great job, Squidward.
",4
7454,Mr. Krabs,65," What have you done to real Squidward?
",4
7455,Carl,65," The less you know, Eugene, the better.

7456,Mr. Krabs,65," What's going on around here? Where's SpongeBob? [in the kitchen, Krabby Patties are being made in a different way through an oven and spray painted to make it look like a real Krabby Patty]
",4
7457,SpongeBob,65," [takes a Krabby Patty from the basket] Where's the love?
",4
7458,Mr. Krabs,65," SpongeBob, what happened to the Krabby Patties?
",4
7459,SpongeBob,65," I tried to tell them... but they wouldn't listen to me!

7460,Mr. Krabs,65," This is obscene. [walks out of the kitchen] Carl, I need to have a wor...

7461,Cash Register,65," Your change is $1.75.
",4
7462,Mr. Krabs,65," Automated cash register? Noo! [eyes roll back in his head] Hey, Carl, what have you done to me restaurant? Processed Krabby Patties? Computerized registers?
",4
7463,Carl,65," Look around you. our customers are quite content with the contrived and the mediocre. [customer falls asleep, burping]
",4
7464,Mr. Krabs,65," That's because they don't know what they're eating. [grabs a pile of the gray sludge from the Krabby Patty making machine in the kitchen then walks up to a customer] Excuse me, ma'am, do you know what's in that patty you're eating?
",4
7465,Customer,65," No. [Mr. Krabs shows pile of the gray sludge. Customer runs out]
",4
7466,Mr. Krabs,65," See that, without all your smoke & mirrors, no one would stomach this garbage.
",4
7467,Edward,65," What'd he say? Garbage? [customers notice what's in the Krabby Patties and everyone runs out]
",4
7468,Carl,65," Eugene, you're in violation of your contract.
",4
7469,Carl,65," Mr. Blandy? Code red! Free thinker!
",4
7470,Howard,65," Mr. Krabs, is there a problem here?
",4
7471,Mr. Krabs,65," You better believe there's a problem! I used to kiss the ground you walked on, Blandy! But after seeing this, I wouldn't even spit in your direction! Krabby Patties are supposed to be made by hand, one at a time! Not on a conveyor belt! [Krabby Patty machine inflates and about to blow up.]
",4
7472,Carl,65," Oh, my. [the garbage blows up from the kitchen and blows everybody away off the Krabby 'O' Mondays including the employees. The restaurant blows up and got destroyed. Carl was seen floating away. ] Does this mean I won't get that raise, sir?
",4
7473,Howard,65," [He looks at the restaurant which is destroyed by the gray meat.] It's ruined!
",4
7474,Friend,65," We'll have to sell it. We'll be lucky if we get a fraction of what we paid for it. [Mr. Krabs drives up with boat full of suitcases]
",4
7475,Mr. Krabs,65," I'll buy it for full price.
",4
7476,Friend,65," Sold. We won't be needing your contract anymore. [rips off the contract] Nice doing business with you.
",4
7477,Mr. Krabs,65," Pleasure's all mine. Now get out of me restaurant. [laughs while Howard and his friends walks away, leaving SpongeBob and Squidward.] We did it, boys. [puts the hats on them] The Krusty Krab is ours again. Ya know, in a fit of maniacal rage, I may have destroyed the restaurant, scared away all our customers, and forced us into bankruptcy because I returned nearly every penny I sold this stink heap for, but it was all worth it. And I got back the love of my dear friends.
",4
7478,Squidward,65," Really, Mr. Krabs?
",4
7479,Mr. Krabs,65," No, not really. Get back to work. [He hands them Spatula and the Mop. SpongeBob was glad while Squidward was annoyed leaving Mr. Krabs, who now  pushes the key to open the register and ends with dollar signs]",4

SpongeBob, Squidly, and Patrick all head to the bridge to stop the evil wizard, but a Dark Knight blocks their path]

7598,Dark Knight,66," [dark male voice] Halt, who goes there?

7599,Squidly,66," Doth my eyes betray me? 'Tis the nefarious dark knight. ♪Oh dark knight, spare us please, don't cut off our heads or boil our knees. Pray take these two and let me go free and I will give to thee some...cheese! [cow makes sounds]

7602,SpongeBob,66," I am SpongeBob and this is Patrick. [laughs nervously] We've been sent to rescue Princess Pearl from Planktonamor.

7606,Dark Knight,66," Doth thou tryeth to insult me? Thou willst drink from the fountain of shame!
",4
7607,SpongeBob,66," Pssh, did you hear that Patrick? I told you she thinks like a squirrel. [Dark Knight destroys the armor and throws SpongeBob into a rock. SpongeBob ends up having his legs and arms switched. He laughs] Good one, Medieval Sandy. But can you handle my feet of fury? [attacks Dark Knight but the Dark Knight jumps out of the way as SpongeBob bounces off the rock and into Dark Knight sending her into the other rock. SpongeBob attacks her again but the Dark Knight pins SpongeBob against the rock]
",4
7608,Dark Knight,66," Wouldst thou like a little rub down? [as she is rubbing SpongeBob turns into dust causing the Dark Knight to cough. SpongeBob appears normal again and karate chops the Dark Knight] You have bested me, yellow knight... Strike quick and true, noble sponge...
",4
7609,SpongeBob,66," I don't understand a word you just said! [laughs. Dark Knight turns into a real live action squirrel but with the crosses for eyes] Uhh, Medieval Sandy, you don't look so good. Sandy? Sandy…? [screen turns black then water is thrown onto the Dark Knight] Patrick, it's working. Do it again. [Patrick gathers spit and spits it upon her]
",4
7610,Dark Knight,66," Thou hath spared me kind and noble sponge. And unto thee, I owe a debt of gratitude, for I will follow you on your quest to defeat Planktonamor and learn a trifle of that karate.

7611,SpongeBob,66," Yeah, karate! [karate chops Squidly in half]

7612,Squidly,66," Oweth.

7617,Patrick,66," No, uhh, I mean yes. Yes! That's what I said, heh. Yes.

7618,Dark Knight,66," Then let us forge on. Make way, heathens. Dark Knight coming through.
",4
7619,Guard,66," State thy business, Dark Knight.
",4
7620,Dark Knight,66," These village idiots are conspirators against Master Planktonamor and I needeth know which form of torture thy master wishes upon these wretched fools. Do I have their limbs tied to horses and swiftly yanked apart? Rip! Or pluck each individual eyelash one by one, taking away their every single last eyelash wish! [SpongeBob screams]
",4
7621,Guard,66," Very well, Dark Knight. Entrance be granted. [SpongeBob still screaming] Halt! Make a wish. [plucks one of SpongeBob's eyelashes]
",4
7622,Dark Knight,66," Wow, goodsome thinking, Sir SpongeBob. Posing as a frightened wee babe in ye ol' diapers did make it most believable.
",4
7623,SpongeBob,66," Yeah, you think we fooled them? [Pearl screams] Wait, that's Pearl. I must fulfill the prophecy while you untie Patrick and the royal doofus.
",4
7624,Squidly,66," That be royal fool.

7625,SpongeBob,66," [running up the stairs followed by the rest of the group] Hang on, Pearl, we're coming to rescue you! [panting] We're a-comin'. Almost there. Oh, dear Neptune.

7628,Pearl,66," The prophecy is nigh!

7630,Lord Planktonamor,66," Sparkling or regular? [he tosses the waters away] Psycheth!

7631,SpongeBob,66," [gasps] You truly are the nastiest wizard in all of Bikini Bottomshire. Prepare to be vanquished.

7632,Lord Planktonamor,66," Bring it oneth, knave.
",4
7633,SpongeBob,66," [as he runs to attack Lord Planktonamor, he steps on him without knowing] What the…? Where…? Oh… [laughs and looks down at the squashed Lord Planktonamor.] I didn't see you. You're so tiny. [Plankton gets up and uses his magic on SpongeBob. But SpongeBob laughs] That tickles! Tiny powers! Tiny powers! [as Lord Planktonamor is zapping SpongeBob, the rest of the group frees Pearl but she crashes through the top]
",4
7634,Pearl,66," I be-eth ok.

7635,Lord Planktonamor,66," [SpongeBob gets zapped by the dragon] Wow…huh? [notices dragon] Yes! Yes! Sicketh them boy! [dragon chases them]

7638,Patrick,66," No! No! No! [gets zapped]

7639,Lord Planktonamor,66," Dead end for you, simpleton. [laughs]
",4
7640,SpongeBob,66," Wait a minute. [gets out the jellyfish net and captures the dragon] Wow, the boys back home will never believe this.
",4
7641,Patrick,66," I'm right here and I don't believe it. [dragon zaps his way out of the net]
",4
7642,SpongeBob and Patrick,66," No! No! No! No!
",4
7643,SpongeBob,66," Well, I guess this is it, Pat.
",4
7644,Patrick,66," Yeah. Hey, can we eat those Krabby Patties now?
",4
7645,SpongeBob,66," Sure, buddy.
",4
7646,Patrick,66," Yay! [dragon takes the Krabby Patty, sniffs it, and eats it] Hey!
",4
7647,SpongeBob,66," Patrick look! He's eating the Krabby Patties.
",4
7648,Patrick,66," Huh? No! No! No-o-o! The horror. The horror.
",4
7649,SpongeBob,66," No, Patrick, it's a good thing.
",4
7650,Patrick,66," It is?
",4
7651,SpongeBob,66," Sure it is. Just listen to him purr. He loves that Krabby Patty.

7652,Lord Planktonamor,66," Forsooth. What be-eth going on here? Destroy them! Do it now or so help me.

7653,SpongeBob,66," Umm, I'd be more than happy to make you some more of those delicious Krabby Patties. [dragons zaps Planktonamor]

7654,Lord Planktonamor,66," Curses. You win.

7656,King,66," Order up! [flips burger so dragon catches it and eats it] Hmmm, I doth wonder if I could sell these, uhh, Krabby Patties. [laughs. Squidly plays his clarinet]
",4
7657,Citizen,66," Not that horrible noise.
",4
7658,Citizen #2,66," Make it stop! [citizen #1 throws a rock through the clarinet, which makes Squidly fall down, causing the seahorses to launch SpongeBob and Patrick into the air and back down where it is now the present]
",4
7659,Medieval Queen,66," Hey kid, are you ok? That was some fall you had.
",4
7660,SpongeBob,66," Oh, I guess I shouldn't have agitated that seahorse. That was some dream, huh, Patrick? Patrick?

7669,Nat,67," What?! You mean you kidnapped us just to sell us your fast food?

7688,Mr. Krabs,67," Oh, look at the time! So sorry to have to rush off. Bye! [pushes Mama Krabs out his office and closes his door] Whew, that was a close one.
",4
7689,Plankton,67," Why did I ever buy that computer wife? I need a real woman--not a girl in a cold-hearted shell. [Plankton hears Mama Krabs humming outside so he brings down his periscope on her] Such beauty. She's an angel; and no wires. I've never felt like this before. I don't even know her name and yet she's stolen my heart.
",4
7690,Karen,67," Plankton! You've fallen in love with another woman?! I'm your wife!

",4
7696,Robot Plankton,67," Roses are red. Violets are blue. World domination has nothing on you. [she screams]
",4
7697,Plankton,67," Hmmm, I guess she's not a poetry fan. [everyone is running around screaming while the robot is using its eye laser to spell out ""I [heart] You"" on the ground, but while destroying some of the town when doing this. Mama Krabs reads it and screams a few times. The Trouble Song] Poetry, love notes--nothing's working. Perhaps something personal. [Mama Krabs is shrieking. The robot walks over to a rock and karate chops a memorial-like statue of Mama Krabs' head and puts her down]
",4
7698,Mama Krabs,67," [stops screaming]Am I really that pretty?
",4
7699,Plankton,67," Oh, yeah...I am smooth. [cut to later in his restaurant by a phone] Just dial the number and ask her to dinner. C'mon, you can do this. [dial tones beeping; Plankton grunting]

",4
7703,Plankton,67," [laughing] No. I program the robot. Did you enjoy the gift I sent you?
",4
7704,Mama Krabs,67," How did you know I wanted a hat? Have you been spying on me? [6 TV screens are set-up to in different parts of Mama Krabs house]
",4
7705,Plankton,67," It was...just a lucky guess. I've admired you from afar for far too long, my angel. We must meet face-to-face.
",4
7706,Plankton,67," Sounds wonderful. I'll be the tall fellow wearing a red carnation. Until tonight, my dear. [cut to Mama Krabs walking into the Krusty Krab]
",4
7707,Mr. Krabs,67," Ah! Quick, SpongeBob, swallow me wallet!
",4
7708,SpongeBob,67," OK. [Mr. Krabs shoves his wallet in SpongeBob's mouth and SpongeBob swallows it]
",4
7709,Mr. Krabs,67," Oh, sorry, Mommy. I can't lend you any money. SpongeBob accidentally swallowed me wallet. [sniffs his mother's hat] Mommy, you got yourself a hat without my financial assistance.
",4
7710,Mama Krabs,67," Isn't it nice, Eugene? It's just the one I wanted.
",4
7711,Mr. Krabs,67," But, Mommy, you shouldn't be spending my inheritance...I mean, since you told me you wanted a hat, I went out and I dug one up. [takes out a hat with holes in it]
",4
7712,Mama Krabs,67," Where did you get this old thing? [at a funeral where two fish are paying their respects to the person in the coffin]
",4
7713,Nat,67," She looks so peaceful.
",4
7714,Fred,67," Yeah. But wasn't she wearing a hat? [Mr. Krabs is seen running out with the hat behind him]
",4
7715,Mama Krabs,67," You can take this one back to the trash heap.
",4
7716,Mr. Krabs,67," Yes, Mommy. [tosses hat and shovel to Squidward] Squidward, I need you to make a return for me.
",4
7717,Mama Krabs,67," Thank ye for your concern for my finances, but me new boyfriend bought me this hat.
",4
7718,Mr. Krabs,67," Boyfriend? Someone to spend money...I mean time with you? That's wonderful! Who is he? What's his name?
",4
7719,Mama Krabs,67," I don't know. I'm meeting him here, tonight.
",4
7720,Mr. Krabs,67," Wonderful! I'll stay open late so ye can have a nice, romantic dinner. Run along, make yourself pretty. SpongeBob, you're working late tonight. No overtime! [SpongeBob lunges himself into the door. Cut to Plankton wearing a rose, walking into the Krusty Krab where SpongeBob is in a waiter uniform]
",4
7721,Plankton,67," [clears throat] I've reservations for two, tonight.
",4
7722,SpongeBob,67," Right this way, sir. [SpongeBob pulls back the chair for Plankton as he jumps up on it]
",4
7723,Plankton,67," [shouts] Excuse me, I can't reach my silverware!
",4
7724,SpongeBob,67," Terribly sorry, sir. [reaches into his pocket and takes out a miniature table and chair. Places it on top of the big table then grabs Plankton and places him in the chair] Will there be anything else?
",4
7725,Plankton,67," Is my tie on straight?
",4
7726,SpongeBob,67," You look fabulous! [Mama Krabs walks in] Your gentlemen caller awaits. [Mama Krabs walks up to the table]
",4
7727,Plankton,67," [pulls rose away from his body] Hello, my dear. I must say you look ravishing tonight. [Mama Krabs notices tiny Plankton]
",4
7728,Mama Krabs,67," Oh, my, you're a tiny thing, but awfully cute. Tell me about yourself. [sits down in a chair that SpongeBob has brought to her]
",4
7729,Plankton,67," Well, I'm in the food service business. I'm a bit of a restaurateur. I'm the founder and owner of the Chum Bucket.
",4
7730,Mama Krabs,67," Never heard of it.
",4
7731,Plankton,67," [Points to the Chum Bucket] It's across the street.
",4
7732,Mama Krabs,67," Doesn't ring a bell. [Plankton shows her the back of a phone book with a picture of him and the Chum Bucket]
",4
7733,Plankton,67," It's on the back of the phone book! Come on! I paid a lotta money for that ad! [Puts the book away] Never mind, Never mind. I'd like to hear about you.
",4
7734,Mama Krabs,67," Well...

",4
7743,Mr. Krabs,67," This no-good conniving chiseler is your date?
",4
7744,SpongeBob,67," And this devilishly handsome sponge is your waiter.
",4
7745,Mr. Krabs,67," SpongeBob! I don't know what sort of skullduggory you're up to, Plankton, and I'm not waiting to find out. [picks up Plankton by his antenna]
",4
7746,Mama Krabs,67," Eugene, you put me boyfriend down, this instant!
",4
7747,Plankton,67," Boyfriend?
",4
7748,Mr. Krabs,67," But, mommy...
",4
7749,Plankton,67," You heard the lady. Let me go. [Mr. Krabs drops him into Mama Krabs' hand]
",4
7750,Plankton,67," That's more like it.
",4
7751,Mama Krabs,67," Come, Plankton. I'm sorry me son had to spoil our romantic evening.
",4
7752,Mr. Krabs,67," Mommy? [cut to Plankton cleaning a picture of Mama Krabs then in walks Mr. Krabs] You!
",4
7753,Plankton,67," Eugene.
",4
7754,Mr. Krabs,67," I came to warn you, Plankton. Stay away from me mother. I know what you're really up to.
",4
7755,Plankton,67," I'm serious, Eugene. I've changed my ways. And all it took was the love of a beautiful woman.
",4
7756,Mr. Krabs,67," All you love is thieving and conniving. Now, stop trying to get the formula out of me mother.
",4
7757,Plankton,67," What are you talking about?
",4
7758,Mr. Krabs,67," I'm talking about the Krabby Patty formula!
",4
7759,Plankton,67," Your mother knows the Krabby Patty formula?
",4
7760,Plankton,67," Not family, eh? I can fix that. [cut to Mama Krabs walking into the Krusty Krab]
",4
7761,Mama Krabs,67," Eugene!
",4
7762,Mr. Krabs,67," Mommy!
",4
7763,Mama Krabs,67," What did I tell ye about interfering in me life?
",4
7764,Mr. Krabs,67," Mommy, can't you see? He's trying to seduce the Krabby Patty formula right from under you.
",4
7765,Mama Krabs,67," For your information, Eugene, he hasn't asked me once about the formula. I doubt that he even knows that I know it.
",4
7766,Mr. Krabs,67," [chuckles] Uh, yeah...funny thing about that.
",4
7767,Mama Krabs,67," I forbid ye to interfere in me private business. Go to your office, now!
",4
7768,Mr. Krabs,67," Yes, mommy. [walks into his office]
",4
7769,Plankton,67," Somebody call heaven because I think an angel's gone missing.
",4
7770,Mama Krabs,67," Oh, Sheldon.
",4
7771,Plankton,67," Oh, Mrs. Krabs.
",4
7772,Mr. Krabs,67," Oh, brother.
",4
7773,Plankton,67," Attention, attention everyone. I'd like to make an announcement. Mrs. Krabs, in full view of this restaurant, I ask you for your hand in holy matrimony.
",4
7774,Crowd,67," Aw!
",4
7775,Plankton,67," Would you marry me? [big diamond ring shown up close]
",4
7776,Mr. Krabs,67," Ah, that's it! No more hiding in my room like a scared little kid, it's time to act like a man! [jumps at Plankton]
",4
7777,Plankton,67," Gasp![actually says the word]
",4
7778,Mr. Krabs,67," [jumps in his mother's lap] Please don't marry him, mommy! Don't marry this bad, bad man! I don't want you to!
",4
7779,Plankton,67," Too late Krabsy. We're going to be married. And you're gonna be my new son! [laughs maniacally. Mama Krabs hands the ring back to Plankton] Huh? What's this, honey bunch?
",4
7780,Mama Krabs,67," I'm flattered by your offer, really I am, but I'm just not ready for that kind of commitment. [Mr. Krabs laughs]
",4
7781,Plankton,67," What is this? There's somebody else, isn't there? [Robot Plankton stomping thunderously]
",4
7782,Robot Plankton,67," [breaks into Krusty Krab with flowers] I...I...this is very uncomfortable. I'll just wait in the car.
",4
7783,Plankton,67," I don't believe this! You led me on!
",4
7784,Mama Krabs,67," Now, now, Plankton, it's not what ye think.
",4
7785,Plankton,67," I don't want to hear your lies! You owe me for leading me on like this! Give me the Krabby Patty formula and we'll call it even.
",4
7786,Mama Krabs,67," The formula? Is that what this whole thing was about?
",4
7787,Plankton,67," No, no, not really. I mean, not at first. I mean uh...honey bunch? Uh-oh. [Mama Krabs shows her muscles, which show as ships cannons. She punches Plankton back to the Chum Bucket] Oh, well, 'tis better to loved and lost then never to be loved at all! [Plankton ends up flying into the ON switch of Karen]
",4
7788,Karen,67," Working.
",4
7789,Plankton,67," So, you decided to come crawling back to me, huh?
",4
7790,Karen,67," [a laser machine comes down] What did you say?
",4
7791,Plankton,67," [chuckles nervously] Nothing, dear.
",4
7792,Karen,67," [zaps him] Yeah, that's what I thought you said, honey bunch. [Plankton groans]",4

7801,Patrick,68," Huh? [tries to read it as he is running] Duuhh... aaann... ger... [falls off the cliff] cliff!
",4
7802,SpongeBob,68," Patrick! [runs down the cliff to Patrick] Let me help you out of there, buddy! [grabs a starfish shaped head out of the ground. When he notices its just a head, he screams] Is the rest of you down there?
",4
7803,Patrick,68," [walks up to SpongeBob with no head attached to his body] The rest of me is up here.
",4
7804,SpongeBob,68," Whew, you had me worried there, buddy. [laughs] Here's your head. [attaches the head onto Patrick and laughs. Picture of inside Patrick's head shows a plug plugging into an outlet. Gears and cranks start up. Patrick gets a spark or two from his head]
",4
7805,Patrick,68," I find all this laughter to be highly illogical.
",4
7806,SpongeBob,68," Well, let's stop laughin' and start fishing'! [takes out two jellyfish nets. Hands a net to Patrick] Go ahead, you get first crack.
",4
7807,Patrick,68," [jellyfish floats by] Look at them. These graceful stoic creatures of the deep.
",4
7808,SpongeBob,68," Huh? Those are some big words, Pat. I've never heard you use them before.
",4
7809,Patrick,68," Nonsense, my vocabulary is infinitely expanding.
",4
7810,SpongeBob,68," Well, let's expand our jellyfish nets. C'mon, Patrick. [captures a jellyfish] Look buddy, I captured one!
",4
7811,Patrick,68," Yes... [shows SpongeBob a notebook with a Davinci-style jellyfish drawn] I captured one as well without disturbing its delicate ecosystem. It is wrong to harness nature in such a barbaric manner. [frees the jellyfish from SpongeBob's net]
",4
7812,SpongeBob,68," OK...what do you wanna do?
",4
7813,Patrick,68," Let us go off and admire the beauty and fragility of nature.
",4
7814,SpongeBob,68," Pretty.
",4
7815,Patrick,68," Yes, quite.
",4
7816,SpongeBob,68," Fragile.
",4
7817,Patrick,68," Indeed.
",4
7818,SpongeBob,68," [jumps at Patrick 3 times] C'mon Patrick, let's do something fun.
",4
7819,Patrick,68," Oh, you want to run some statistics or observe phenomenon and render hypothesis of said phenomenon?
",4
7820,SpongeBob,68," I was thinking more like jumping rope [jumps rope with his arms], 1-legged races [one leg goes inside his body and he hops on his remaining leg], or playing duck-duck-hermit crab. [jumps into a hermit-crab shell and blows bubbles]
",4
7821,Patrick,68," Doesn't feel like fun.
",4
7822,SpongeBob,68," How about some jokes? [Patrick sighs] Patrick, what's the difference between a guitar and a jellyfish?
",4
7823,Patrick,68," You can't strum a jellyfish.
",4
7824,SpongeBob,68," Yes! [laughs. Patrick grabs a jellyfish and strums its tentacles]
",4
7825,Patrick,68," Oh my, look at the time. I really must be going. [walks off]
",4
7826,SpongeBob,68," What's wrong with Patrick? I sure hope he gets better soon. [at Patrick's house where Patrick is doing some scientific work] Are you better, Pat? Uhh, whatcha doing?
",4
7827,Patrick,68," Just studying this amazing sub-species.
",4
7828,Plankton,68," [through a microscope] I'll show you subspecies.
",4
7829,SpongeBob,68," Wanna visit Squidward?
",4
7830,Patrick,68," Well, since I am finished with my work I'll humor you with your trivial pursuits. [now at Squidward's house where Squidward is playing his clarinet. He hears SpongeBob and Patrick come in and prepares to yell at them] I'd recognize that piece anywhere! Cornelius Pufferfish's Opus 67 symphony in blue.
",4
7831,Squidward,68," [very confused] Patrick?
",4
7832,Patrick,68," It's a beautiful piece. Execution needs some work. [walks over to the piano] May I suggest on the 7th bar of the adagio andante that you add a little fortissimo on the arpeggiated b-flat scale.
",4
7833,Squidward,68," Wow, I never thought to do it like that.
",4
7834,Patrick,68," Well, that is because you rarely think.
",4
7835,SpongeBob,68," How do you know so much about music?
",4
7836,Patrick,68," A creative outlet provides a spiritual release and helps facilitate a healthy mental balance. [inhales] Ah.
",4
7837,SpongeBob,68," Does that include... [burps] belch-talk-ing?
",4
7838,Patrick,68," [waving his hand in front of his face] Mr. SquarePants, I find your humor vulgar.
",4
7839,Squidward,68," I had no idea you were so knowledgeable, Patrick. Do you think you can be my musical mentor?
",4
7840,SpongeBob,68," Uhh, guys?
",4
7841,Patrick,68," Let's take it from the top. [Squidward plays, badly] Not so excellent, Squidward. Let me demonstrate the proper technique. [looks at clarinet with spit covered all over the mouth piece] On second thought, practice makes perfect. Let's begin. [SpongeBob comes up playing his musical nose as a flute] Thank you, my good chap. Unfortunately, this is a solo piece for clarinet only. And 1, 2, 3, 4... [Squidward plays more. SpongeBob frowns and walks out. Patrick covers his ears since Squidward's playing is still terrible] Stop! Enough! [walks out] Find yourself a new mentor!
",4
7842,SpongeBob,68," Now that you have some free-time, let's get some grub.
",4
7843,Patrick,68," No, SpongeBob, I'm afraid not.
",4
7844,SpongeBob,68," Well, I have a brand new bottle of super-bubbly bubble soap. [blows a bubble that pops on Patrick's face]
",4
7845,Patrick,68," [wiping his face] No, thanks again.
",4
7846,SpongeBob,68," Well, maybe later we can play pirates.
",4
7847,Patrick,68," Robert, my dear, it's no use. We've just grown apart.
",4
7848,SpongeBob,68," What? What do you mean?
",4
7849,Patrick,68," I know we've had fun in the past but we're just not compatible anymore. It's time we went our separate ways...such is life.
",4
7850,SpongeBob,68," [starting to cry] But Patrick... you're my best friend.
",4
7851,Patrick,68," I know it's hard but brace up chap.
",4
7852,SpongeBob,68," Yeah.
",4
7853,Patrick,68," Maybe our paths will cross again someday. Think fondly of me, Mr. SquarePants.
",4
7854,SpongeBob,68," Goodbye, Mr... Best friend! [sobs. At Sandy's treedome, SpongeBob rings her doorbell] Sandy, you there? I need some professional help. [Sandy and Patrick are heard laughing inside] Patrick?
",4
7855,Sandy,68," Well, Pat, the new you gets an A+.
",4
7856,Patrick,68," Why, thank you, Sandra. I find your intellect rather stimulating as well.
",4
7857,Sandy,68," Oh, really? Well, thanks. [SpongeBob cries then walks away from the treedome, at a chalkboard there's an equation on it] Well, Patrick, what do you think about this problem?
",4
7858,Patrick,68," [changes formula] You simply change the literal term to a coefficient and the minuend will achieve the desired quotient. Even the simplest of mammals can figure it out with a little thought.
",4
7859,Sandy,68," [angrily puts her hands on her hips] What do you mean by that, Patrick?
",4
7860,Patrick,68," I'm merely suggesting you lack the ability to solve remedial equations.
",4
7861,Sandy,68," Are you suggesting I'm dumb?
",4
7862,Patrick,68," I'd use a more sophisticated word like 'impaired'.
",4
7863,Sandy,68," I think you'd better leave!
",4
7864,Patrick,68," I was only trying to help. [walks off]
",4
7865,Sandy,68," I don't need your kind of help, Mr. know-it-all. I liked you better when you were a barnacle head!
",4
7866,SpongeBob,68," [sitting on his chair at home crying] I never thought I'd lose my best friend. How can I compete with geniusness? Ohhhhhh!
",4
7867,Patrick,68," [sitting on his chair at home] Surrounded by knowledge and no one to share it with. No one I can call friend. Who's that old chap I used to run with? [notices a book on the table next to him called 'MY FRIEND SPONGEBOB'] SpongeBob.
",4
7868,SpongeBob,68," [looks at his 'MY FRIEND PATRICK' book] Well, at least Patrick's my friend in my memories. [SpongeBob looks at several pictures of him and Patrick together, as SpongeBob begins to cry another picture is shown, it's revealed that Patrick is the one who put a tear on the last picture]
",4
7869,Patrick,68," Aww, the glory days, why have we grown apart? I must apply all that I know to solve this problem! [looks at x-rays of him & SpongeBob's head, meditates on top of his rock, studies Squidward, reads book. He puts the book down and shows his bloodshot eyes] What could it be? [applies a chemical on his head and grows hair] What's different? Ah! [tears out his hair] What?! I'd do anything to have my old buddy back by my side again!
",4
7870,SpongeBob,68," [doorbell rings] Coming... [opens door and gets kidnapped in a jellyfish net. Patrick is shown carrying the net over his shoulder with SpongeBob inside. SpongeBob pops out happily] Patrick, you're kidnapping me?
",4
7871,Patrick,68," Yes, I am.
",4
7872,SpongeBob,68," Yay! [jumps out of the net and writes ""Yippie"" in the air with bubble soap] What should we do?
",4
7873,Patrick,68," We are going to have fun. Whatever the cost may be.
",4
7874,SpongeBob,68," Let's do this.
",4
7875,Patrick,68," Yes, let's have some fun.
",4
7876,SpongeBob,68," [jumping around] Oh, yeah!
",4
7877,Patrick,68," [jumping around] Oh, absolutely! [now riding on a shell down a mountain] Are you quite sure I found this activity to be fun?
",4
7878,SpongeBob,68," Yeah. [screams with enjoyment. Shell lunges them into the sand] That was fun, huh Patrick?
",4
7879,Patrick,68," [Swallows a mouth-full of sand] When did the fun go away, SpongeBob?
",4
7880,SpongeBob,68," It went away when you jumped off that cliff and knocked your head clean off.
",4
7881,Patrick,68," That's it! [runs off]
",4
7882,SpongeBob,68," That's what? Patrick, what are doing?
",4
7883,Patrick,68," I'm going to duplicate my actions from that day to ascertain the origin of my head! [falls off cliff]
",4
7884,SpongeBob,68," Patrick! Hold on, buddy! [takes Patrick out of the ground] There ya go. [notices he has no head and screams] Don't worry, Patrick. I found your head last time, I'll find it again! [searches around some coral] Not back there. [checks under a rock] Not under here. What if I can't find it? Oh pore headless Patrick?! [turns around and runs into Patrick making his head pop out] Patrick, your head is back! But, uhh, do you feel different?
",4
7885,Patrick,68," Quite unchanged, actually.
",4
7886,SpongeBob,68," I guess... we'll never have fun together again.
",4
7887,Patrick,68," You said you found my dislodged cranial cap last time.
",4
7888,SpongeBob,68," Yes.
",4
7889,Patrick,68," Where exactly did you find it?
",4
7890,SpongeBob,68," Uhh, it was right here.
",4
7891,Patrick,68," Hmmm, impossible! If I landed here, the trajectory of my dismembered skull would cause it to come to rest, not there, but here, exactly 5 meters due north.
",4
7892,SpongeBob,68," But if that's your head, then what did I pick up over... [sign says 'Brain Coral Field'] Brain Coral! No wonder you got so smart, buddy. [blows off the Poison Sea Urchins off Patrick's head] Here you go, Patrick, your old head. Are you sure you want to give up being smart and sophisticated to be my friend again?
",4
7893,Patrick,68," Knowledge can never replace friendship. I prefer to be an idiot!
",4
7894,SpongeBob,68," Not just an idiot, Patrick. You're also my pal. [Patrick takes off his coral head and SpongeBob puts his old one back on] Patrick? Say something, Patrick.
",4
7895,Patrick,68," [burps] Hi, SpongeBob.
",4
7896,SpongeBob,68," Patrick, you're back!
",4
7897,Patrick,68," Patrick, you're back. [both laugh, then pull out their jellyfish nets, make oo-loo-loo sounds, and run off into the sunset]",4

",4
7905,Squidward,69," SpongeBob?
",4
7906,SpongeBob,69," So, here's where the bizarre twist comes in.
",4
7907,Squidward,69," SpongeBob?
",4
7908,SpongeBob,69," They weren't overcooked at all!
",4
7909,Squidward,69," SpongeBob, look! [picks him up and turns him around where we are shown a tall building]
",4
7910,SpongeBob,69," Wow, what happened to the Krusty Krab?
",4
7911,Mr. Krabs,69," Good morning! The Krusty Towers is now opened for business!
",4
7912,SpongeBob,69," Why did you build a hotel, Mr. Krabs?
",4
7913,Squidward,69," Why would anyone stay in a hotel in Bikini Bottom? It's in the middle of scenic nowhere! There's nothing to do but get stung by jellyfish. [jellyfish stings Squidward on the head, forming a bump] See?
",4
7914,SpongeBob,69," [pushes the bump in and it goes to the other side of Squidward's head] Ooh!
",4
7915,Mr. Krabs,69," Come inside. [now inside Krusty Towers] Isn't it beautiful?
",4
7916,Squidward,69," Where are all the new hotel employees? [Mr. Krabs throws uniforms onto Squidward & SpongeBob. Frank enters]
",4
7917,Mr. Krabs,69," My first hotel guest! Watch me reel him in. [walks behind desk] Welcome to the Krusty Towers, where our motto is ""We shall never deny a guest even the most ridiculous request"".
",4
7918,Dave,69," Oh, that's great. I'd like a double Krabby Patty with no onions and extra pickles.
",4
7919,Mr. Krabs,69," If you want a Krabby Patty, you'll have to rent a room and order room service.
",4
7920,Dave,69," [looks at watch] Ooh, I've only got an hour for lunch. [sighs and leaves]
",4
7921,Squidward,69," Boy, you reeled that one in like a pro.
",4
7922,Mr. Krabs,69," Ok, Squidward, you man the front desk.
",4
7923,Patrick,69," I'd like a Krabby Patty, please.
",4
7924,Squidward,69," This is a hotel now. If you want a Krabby Patty, you'll have to get a room and order room service.
",4
7925,Patrick,69," Ok, one Krabby Patty and one room with cheese. Oh, and can I get cheese on the Krabby Patty, too?
",4
7926,Squidward,69," Patrick, you only live 400 yards away. Why do you want to check into a hotel?
",4
7927,Patrick,69," Sometimes I just need to get away from it all. [rings bell] Wow, this hotel has everything!
",4
7928,Squidward,69," [takes bell] Gimme that! Now sign the register.
",4
7929,Patrick,69," I didn't know there would be a test. I didn't study! [cries]
",4
7930,Squidward,69," Patrick, all you have to do is write your name.
",4
7931,Patrick,69," Oh, ok. [takes pen] Do you mind?! [Squidward turns around so Patrick starts writing. Squidward peeks] Don't look! [Squidward turns around] Done! [Patrick drew an airplane and himself]
",4
7932,Squidward,69," Close enough. Here's your room key.
",4
7933,Patrick,69," I'll need some help with my bags.
",4
7934,Squidward,69," How can you have bags?! You just found out this is a hotel!
",4
7935,Patrick,69," This is a hotel?
",4
7936,Squidward,69," [groans] SpongeBob!
",4
7937,SpongeBob,69," Yes, Squidward?
",4
7938,Squidward,69," Take Patrick and his bags to his room.
",4
7939,Patrick,69," What about my Krabby Patty?
",4
7940,Squidward,69," And bring him a Krabby Patty.
",4
7941,Mr. Krabs,69," Squidward, you can take Patrick's bags up to his room. SpongeBob, you go make the Krabby Patty. [he exits]
",4
7942,Squidward,69," Oh, Mr Krabs!
",4
7943,Mr. Krabs,69," What's the matter? Afraid of a little manual labor? [mocking Squidward] I'm Squidward and I have to work for a living. Boo hoo hoo hoo hoo.
",4
7944,Squidward,69," Fine. Let's go, Patrick. [has struggle with Patrick's bags as he is walking up to the elevator]
",4
7945,Mr. Krabs,69," [comes out of the elevator] This elevator is for guests only. Take the employee elevator. [walks to the other elevator, which turns out to be stairs, he grumbles because of this. Walks up stairs as Patrick gets off the guest elevator]
",4
7946,Squidward,69," What's in these bags, rocks? [bag opens, spilling out rocks] Hey, these are rocks! Why is your suitcase full of rocks?
",4
7947,Patrick,69," I don't tell you how to live your life!
",4
7948,Squidward,69," Well, here's your room.
",4
7949,Patrick,69," Wow.
",4
7950,Squidward,69," Enjoy your stay.
",4
7951,Patrick,69," Squidward, wait! [takes out a rock from his pocket and gives it to Squidward as a tip] Keep up the good work and there'll be more where that came from.
",4
7952,SpongeBob,69," Your Krabby Patty, sir. [Squidward attempting to throw the rock that Patrick gave to him as a tip] Hey, Squidward, cool rock.
",4
7953,Patrick,69," Hold on a second, SpongeBob. [hands SpongeBob a dollar] Here you are, my good man.
",4
7954,SpongeBob,69," Why, thank you, Patrick!
",4
7955,Patrick,69," There's plenty more where that came from, my good friend [Squidward looks at his rock and becomes frustrated] Squidward!
",4
7956,Squidward,69," What now?!
",4
7957,Patrick,69," I don't like crusts on my sandwich!
",4
7958,Squidward,69," It's a bun; it's all crust! How am I suppose to cut the crust off a bun?
",4
7959,Patrick,69," Peel it.
",4
7960,Squidward,69," [peels the skin off the bun angrily] Happy? [Patrick inhales the patty]
",4
7961,SpongeBob,69," Room service! Here's the 50 Krabby Patties you ordered.
",4
7962,Patrick,69," Could you do one more thing for me?
",4
7963,Squidward,69," Why don't you ask SpongeBob?
",4
7964,Patrick,69," Good idea, Squidward!
",4
7965,SpongeBob,69," How may I serve you, sir?
",4
7966,Patrick,69," I need you to eat these Krabby Patties with me.
",4
7967,SpongeBob,69," Oh, yes, sir! [both of them eat a bunch of Krabby Patties. As Squidward heads down the employee elevator, Mr. Krabs is on the phone]
",4
7968,Mr. Krabs,69," Hold on. Squidward! Patrick needs your help.
",4
7969,Squidward,69," What?! Why didn't he ask me before I walked all the way downstairs?
",4
7970,Mr. Krabs,69," He said he didn't want to bother you, but he got over it.
",4
7971,SpongeBob,69," Thanks, Squidward! [Squidward puts him back in the toilet. Patrick flushes]
",4
7972,Squidward,69," Mr. Krabs, this is ridiculous! Patrick's being completely unreasonable!
",4
7973,Mr. Krabs,69," He can be as unreasonable as he wants! The plaque, Squidward, the plaque!
",4
7974,Squidward,69," But Mr. Krabs...
",4
7975,Mr. Krabs,69," Deny no guests! [phone rings] Why, hello, Patrick. You need Squidward to come up right away? He'll be right there.
",4
7976,Squidward,69," A bubble bath?! Why would I give you a bubble bath?!
",4
7977,Patrick,69," Well, because Mr. Krabs said you would! Well, be sure to make my back extra shiny clean.
",4
7978,Squidward,69," That's it! I've had enough!
",4
7979,Patrick,69," Squidward, wait! The toilet's backed up again!
",4
7980,Mr. Krabs,69," [Squidward comes out of the guest elevator] Hey! Hey, you can't take that elevator! You're an employee!
",4
7981,Squidward,69," Not anymore. I quit. [Squidward throws his uniform on Mr. Krabs]
",4
7982,Mr. Krabs,69," Quit? You can't quit. [Squidward walks out naked and reenters with Hawaiian-styled clothes. Squidward rings bell] Welcome to the Krusty Towers... Squidward?!
",4
7983,Squidward,69," One room, please. On the top floor.
",4
7984,Mr. Krabs,69," What do you think you're doing?
",4
7985,Squidward,69," I need a vacation. I'm overworked. And what better place to relax than Krusty Towers? Where ""we shall never deny a guest even the most ridiculous request"".
",4
7986,Mr. Krabs,69," I don't have to rent you a room!
",4
7987,Squidward,69," I've got cash.
",4
7988,Mr. Krabs,69," Oh... here's your room key.
",4
7989,Squidward,69," Spongebob, carry my things to my room.
",4
7990,SpongeBob,69," Aye aye, guest sir. [turns legs into rockets and blasts off through the ceiling]
",4
7991,Squidward,69," [talking to Mr. Krabs] And you can carry me to my room.
",4
7992,Mr. Krabs,69," And why in tarnation would I do that? You got four legs that aren't broken.
",4
7993,Squidward,69," The plaque. [plaque is shown. Mr. Krabs has just finished carrying Squidward from the employee elevator] Too bad we couldn't take the elevator, but it is for guests only, and you are an employee.
",4
7994,SpongeBob,69," Your room, sir.
",4
7995,Squidward,69," And I'd like to order room service. I'd like a Krabby Patty with cheese, toenail clippings, and nose hairs.
",4
7996,Mr. Krabs,69," [gasps] You've got to be kidding me!
",4
7997,Squidward,69," And I want it here in 5 seconds.
",4
7998,SpongeBob,69," Yes, sir! [runs off and comes back with a Krabby Patty in less than 2 seconds] Here you are, sir.
",4
7999,Mr. Krabs,69," Well, you got your stinky sandwich. Now eat it.
",4
8000,Squidward,69," Oh, I'm not gonna eat this. You are.
",4
8001,Mr. Krabs,69," What?! You're out of your mind if you think I'm going to eat that!
",4
8002,SpongeBob,69," Psst, that's not really a Krabby Patty with cheese, toenails, and nose hairs.
",4
8003,Mr. Krabs,69," [laughs] Now I get ya, boy. Alright, Squidward. [eats Krabby Patty then spits it out, showing his tongue covered with toenails and nose hairs. Squidward laughs] SpongeBob!
",4
8004,SpongeBob,69," Sorry, Mr. Krabs! We were all out of cheese.
",4
8005,Patrick,69," [everything in Patrick's room is covered in cheese] Hooray!
",4
8006,Mr. Krabs,69," [phone rings] What is it, Squidward?
",4
8007,Squidward,69," Send up a dozen cookies just like mother used to make.
",4
8008,Mr. Krabs,69," [at Squidward's room] Here's your homemade cookies.
",4
8009,Squidward,69," [tries one and spits it out] These don't taste like anything mom used to make!
",4
8010,Mr. Krabs,69," Well, how did your mother make 'em?
",4
8011,Squidward,69," How should I know?! Ask my mother! [slams door]
",4

8019,SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs,69," Hooray!
",4
8020,Mr. Krabs,69," [in Squidward's room where Squidward is sampling the cookies] Well?
",4
8021,Squidward,69," I'm impressed! These are just like mother used to make! I just wish mom was a better cook.
",4
8022,Mr. Krabs,69," So you're all taken care of?
",4
8023,Squidward,69," Hm, just one teensy tiny problem. This room is hideous. Redesign it. Neptune the 14th would be nice.
",4
8024,Mr. Krabs,69," What?!
",4
8025,Squidward,69," ""We shall never deny a guest even the most ridiculous request"". [Mr. Krabs & SpongeBob change the room to a blue theme, a modern theme, a country theme, a torture theme, and then back to the original] Perfect!
",4
8026,Mr. Krabs,69," This room is exactly the same as when we started!
",4
8027,Squidward,69," Nothing like getting back to the basics.
",4
8028,Mr. Krabs,69," Let's get outta here, SpongeBob!
",4
8029,Squidward,69," Oh, before you leave, I wanna go swimming.

8030,Mr. Krabs,69," The pool's out back!
",4
8031,Squidward,69," Ha ha, are you crazy? I'm not going outside to swim! [big swimming pool is now inside the room] Come on in, the water's fine. [SpongeBob jumps in]
",4
8032,Mr. Krabs,69," Anything else stupid and unreasonable that you want?
",4
8033,Squidward,69," Nope, that's it.
",4
8034,Mr. Krabs,69," You don't need me to chew your food for ya? Or make you a back scratcher out of me own spine? Or maybe extinguish the sun so the light don't get in your eyes?!
",4
8035,Squidward,69," No, I'm good.
",4
8036,SpongeBob,69," Me, too.
",4
8037,Patrick,69," Wow, an indoor pool?! Well, this place is fancy! [gets on diving board] Cannonball! [jumps in but the pool collapses the hotel back into the Krusty Krab]

8038,Mr. Krabs,69," [at hospital with the gang] Oh, that hotel was a bad idea from the start.

",4
8068,SpongeBob,70," Goodnight, Gary. [They both sleep. Suddenly, his nose starts to itch so a yellow tentacle scratches it. SpongeBob pulls off his blanket to reveal him as an octopus. He screams while the Flying Dutchman laughs. Cut to SpongeBob opening up the refrigerator to a monster popping out and scaring him. Both laugh. Cut to SpongeBob looking in the mirror when in the reflection only, a monster eats him. He sighs and walks off. Cut to him eating cereal, which are eyeballs, and they blink. He sighs and walks off again]
",4
8069,Flying Dutchman,70," Hmm? [SpongeBob walks up and opens a drawer then sighs and takes out the skeleton in it. As he's walking out, a monster pops out from underneath the floor and tries to scare SpongeBob but it doesn't. The monster turns into a giant cockroach, a baby, a clown, which laughs evilly in SpongeBob's face, then Sherlock Holmes, who smokes a pipe, then he spits it out and screams, and even SpongeBob's head! It then grimaces, and dozens of spiders come out, but still nothing is working. Dutchman's head pops out] Hmm?

8084,Flying Dutchman,70," It's official; I'm not scary anymore.
",4
8085,SpongeBob,70," Just what kinda talk is that? You're just off your game, that's all.
",4
8086,Flying Dutchman,70," Maybe I just need a break. Take some time off, you know?
",4
8087,SpongeBob,70," Sure, relax a little.
",4

",4
8099,Purple Ghost,70," Look out below! [riding on a motorcycle down the stairs and crashing into SpongeBob's wall] How was that?
",4
8100,Flying Dutchman,70," Even better the third time.
",4
8101,SpongeBob,70," Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no! EVERYONE, GET OUT!!!
",4
8102,Flying Dutchman,70," Alrighty, boys, party's over. [to Nancy] Time to scoot honey. [everyone leaves except SpongeBob and the Flying Dutchman]
",4
8103,SpongeBob,70," Dutchie! Do you wanna spend eternity on this couch?
",4
8104,Flying Dutchman,70," Well, it is comfy.
",4
8105,SpongeBob,70," Look in the mirror. You're a ghost of your former self!
",4
8106,Flying Dutchman,70," Ah, you're right, SpongeBob. I'm pathetic.
",4
8107,SpongeBob,70," Yes, you are. But we're going to raise you up from your squalled conditions through the use of visual aids. Watch now. [SpongeBob puts a tape into the VCR]
",4
8108,Flying Dutchman,70," What in barnacles is it?
",4
8109,SpongeBob,70," A journey into self-awareness. [on the tape is a fish that uses a square hammer on a gong. An eagle flies through some mountains and calls out. Then some fish, wearing robes and roller skating, skate in a straight line]
",4
8110,Fish,70," The power within. The power within. [last fish holds a medallion up]
",4
8111,Fish #2,70," [whispering] The power within. The power within. The power within. The power within. [the man multiples into a blue, red, and green being of himself] The power within. The power within. [picks up some dirt] The power within! Yeah.
",4
8112,Flying Dutchman,70," That was beautiful!
",4
8113,SpongeBob,70," Now get off of that couch and into your clothes, Dutchman! It's time to get serious. [cut to later that night where an elderly fish lady is walking by some seaweed, where SpongeBob and The Flying Dutchman are hiding behind] Let's start you off easy. You think you can take that old lady down there?
",4
8114,Flying Dutchman,70," What are you kidding me? Scaring her is too easy.
",4
8115,SpongeBob,70," Now that's The Flying Dutchman I know. Let's see you put those words into action.
",4
8116,Flying Dutchman,70," No problemo, compadre. [thunder claps while the Dutchman screams at the old lady] Yargh!
",4
8117,Old Lady,70," Lonnie is that you?
",4
8118,Flying Dutchman,70," What? No! 'Tis I, the ominous Flying Dutchman! [screams]
",4
8119,Old Lady,70," Lonnie, there's this great new product called toothpaste. I think you should try it. [cut to SpongeBob flying on the Flying Dutchman's back. They spot a gym]
",4
8120,Flying Dutchman,70," Let's hit it. [The Flying Dutchman, goes through the wall but SpongeBob does not, smashing into the wall. Inside, Larry the Lobster is lifting weights. Then he looks into the mirror]
",4
8121,Larry,70," Dude, look at your pecks! You're phenomenal! Truly a hard body. Look at those guns. [Flying Dutchman attempts to scare him. Larry gasps]
",4
8122,SpongeBob,70," [chuckles] Now he's got him.
",4
8123,Larry,70," My altissimo dorsi has gone flabby! I gotta get to a rolling machine. [leaves]
",4
8124,Flying Dutchman,70," Ah. It's no use, SpongeBob. I can't seem to scare anyone. Maybe people just don't believe in ghosts anymore.
",4
8125,SpongeBob,70," Wait a minute! I think you gave me the answer to all your problems! [whispers into The Flying Dutchman's ears] ...goblins...guilt trip... [scene cuts to Squidward's house where Squidward slips into his bunny slippers and walks to the mirror. When he picks up his powder, it floats by itself and applies itself onto Squidward.]
",4
8126,Squidward,70," Huh? [Green fog begins to appear and a voice is heard in the fog]
",4
8127,Mrs. Tentacles,70," Squidward! Squidward!
",4
8128,Squidward,70," What's going on?
",4
8129,Mrs. Tentacles,70," Why haven't you called me?
",4
8130,Squidward,70," Mother?
",4
8131,Mrs. Tentacles,70," Why haven't you called your mother?
",4
8132,Squidward,70," [screams] Uh, Squiddums loves his mama.
",4
8133,Mrs. Tentacles,70," Why don't you call me then? Why don't you call me? Why don't you call me? [her face melts turning into a clarinet that plays music. The clarinet goes into one of Squidward's ears and out the other, literally]
",4
8134,Flying Dutchman,70," [through the clarinet] I heard you don't believe in ghosts!
",4
8135,Squidward,70," Ghosts?
",4
8136,Flying Dutchman,70," As in the Flying Dutchman! [tosses Squidward against the wall]
",4
8137,Squidward,70," There's no such thing as ghosts. No such thing.
",4
8138,Flying Dutchman,70," No such thing as ghosts? No such thing as ghosts?! You don't believe in ghosts?! [floor turns into liquid. Another ghost pops up and eats Squidward sending him into a light that spits him back into his house. A giant SpongeBob is sitting there breathing in and out really hard]
",4
8139,Squidward,70," SpongeBob? [SpongeBob's eyes twist around his head and spiders crawl out and reveal the Flying Dutchman. Flying Dutchman does a trick to think that he is pulling his finger off]
",4
8140,Flying Dutchman,70," Ooh, scary!
",4
8141,Squidward,70," No! No! That's impossible! [runs out of his house] Ghosts! Ghosts!
",4
8142,SpongeBob,70," [runs out of the closet] Dutchie, it worked! You got your scare back!
",4
8143,Flying Dutchman,70," And me confidence, too. Now I feel like I can scare the living criminy out of anybody! All thanks to you, my boy.
",4
8144,SpongeBob,70," And, maybe your ship will be repaired soon.
",4
8145,Flying Dutchman,70," Actually, I have a confession, SpongeBob. My ship's been done for three months now. Well, it was nice roomin' with ya. [flies back up to his ship] Oh yeah, I almost forgot! I left you a little something something for all your trouble. Now, it's time for me to ruin more souls. [ships sails off. SpongeBob opens the package. A hand grabs him and pulls him in. SpongeBob laughs]

8213,Billy,71," Meep. [all sighing. SpongeBob, dressed up as a girl, sighs after they do]
",4
8214,SpongeBob,71," [girly voice] Isn't he dreamy? [SpongeBob takes Billy and hands him to the cashier]
",4
8215,Cashier,71," Price check on 4.
",4
8216,Billy,71," Meep.
",4
8217,Squidward,71," I finished Pearl's portrait, Mr. Krabs. It's a true masterpiece. [reveals a meat sculpture of Pearl]
",4
8218,Mr. Krabs,71," Hey...maybe I should have hired that ice sculptor.
",4
8219,Squidward,71," Ice sculptor? Any fool can sculpt in ice. It takes true genius to transform 400 pounds of raw Krabby Patties into a work of such majesty.
",4
8220,Mr. Krabs,71," Yeah. Well, we've got the decor covered. Now how about entertainment? Pearl wants some boy band called 'Boys Who Cry'.
",4
8221,Squidward,71," Boys Who Cry? They're my favorite band. They charge a million dollars just to show up. And if you want them to lip-sync, it'll run into real money.
",4
8222,Mr. Krabs,71," You're a real fan, huh?
",4
8223,Squidward,71," Oh yeah, I know all their songs.
",4
8224,Mr. Krabs,71," All their songs?
",4
8225,Pearl,71," Wouldn't it be cool if my dad got me this for my birthday?
",4
8226,Friend #1,71," It sure would be. If he was cool, which he's not. [laughs]
",4
8227,Pearl,71," Yeah, he probably got me another box of staples.
",4
8228,Mr. Krabs,71," It's almost time for the party to start!
",4
8229,SpongeBob,71," I'm back, Mr. Krabs!
",4
8230,Mr. Krabs,71," SpongeBob, what took you so long? And where's Pearl's present?
",4
8231,SpongeBob,71," the delivery truck will be here momentarily.
",4
8232,Squidward,71," Here she comes, Mr. Krabs.
",4
8233,Mr. Krabs,71," Everybody get into position. [Pearl and friends enter]
",4
8234,All,71," Happy birthday! [everyone is standing in front of the banner that reads 'IT'S A BOY GIRL']
",4
8235,Judy,71," ""It's a boy""?! [3 friends laugh]
",4
8236,Pearl,71," Daddy! [friends walk over to the popcorn machine and try a bite. All gag & cough up the popcorn]
",4
8237,Friend #1,71," Stale popcorn. [friends walk over to the punch bowl and take a sip] It tastes like dishwater.
",4
8238,Squidward,71," It is dishwater. [friends cough out the punch]
",4
8239,Pearl,71," [notices the sculpture] Is that supposed to be me? [head falls off] It's made out of Krabby Patties! Gross.
",4
8240,Mr. Krabs,71," Who wants cake?
",4
8241,Pearl,71," Well, the cake does look good. [all take a bite but spit it right back out] It's made out of cardboard?!
",4
8242,Mr. Krabs,71," And frosting.
",4
8243,Friend #1,71," Well, Pearl, 16 lame parties in a row. Must be a new record. Let's get out of here.
",4
8244,Pearl,71," Wait, don't leave. My dad got Boys Who Cry to play. You did get Boys Who Cry, right?
",4
8245,Mr. Krabs,71," Oh, even better sweetie. Hit it. [curtain unfolds as R & B Music beings to play with Squidward standing on the stage]
",4
8246,Squidward,71," Hello, ladies. [sings] When my tear ducts get issue, I can't use just any tissue... I need 4-ply, 4-Ply, 4-Ply, when I cry... Huh!
",4
8247,Friend #2,71," Hey, that is not Boys Who Cry.
",4
8248,Judy,71," Yeah!
",4
8249,Friend #2,71," Boo!
",4
8250,Friend #1,71," What a rip-off!!
",4
8251,Judy,71," This stinks!
",4
8252,Pearl,71," Daddy, how could you? I gave you a list. [runs out crying]
",4
8253,Mr. Krabs,71," Pearl, come back. [crowd throws Pearls meat head at Squidward]
",4
8254,Pearl,71," You ruined everything! You couldn't stop being cheap, even for me. [cries]
",4
8255,Mr. Krabs,71," I'll make it up to you somehow, Pearl.
",4
8256,SpongeBob,71," That's it. Back it up. Right there. Let 'er go! [dump truck full of presents unloads them all]
",4
8257,Pearl,71," You bought me a boat?
",4
8258,Mr. Krabs,71," I did? I mean...I did?
",4
8259,Friends,71," Wow.
",4
8260,Pearl,71," Oh, daddy, I don't know how it could get better than this.
",4
8261,SpongeBob,71," Just watch. [signals on his walkie-talkie] Hit it boys! [big present at the top opens up]
",4
8262,Endsong,71," Boys Who Cry ""It's All About You""
",4
8263,Mr. Krabs,71," Boy, how much is all this costing me?
",4
8264,SpongeBob,71," Here's the receipt.
",4
8265,Mr. Krabs,71," [freaks out] I ought to...
",4
8266,Pearl,71," Oh, daddy, you got me everything I wanted. [kisses her dad]
",4
8267,Mr. Krabs,71," Ah, nothing's too good for me daughter. Heh.
",4
8268,SpongeBob,71," You're a good dad, Mr. Krabs.
",4
8269,Mr. Krabs,71," Don't push your luck, boy.",4

",4
8291,SpongeBob,72," Oh, Spat, we've been through so much together.

8292,[SpongeBob flashes back to all the good times he had with his spatula,72," flipping patties, laying in the sun with spatula, scratching his back with spatula, playing ping pong with his spatula, reaching under the chair for the remote with spatula, and playing pirates with spatula]
",4
8293,Doctor,72," Theres no easy way to say this. SpongeBob, if I were you, I would give serious consideration to start thinking about a replacement spatula.
",4
8294,Doctor,72," Go home. Get some rest. Well try to do everything we can.
",4
8295,SpongeBob,72," Thank you, Doctor.
",4

",4
8297,SpongeBob,72," [gives a kiss to the spatula and walks out of the hospital] Replacement spatula? How can anything ever replace... HEY! Look at that! [notices a sign that says ""LE SPATULA INSIDE"" and a picture of a high-tech spatula is on it]
",4
8298,SpongeBob,72," [Thinks] Ooh. Looks fancy. So shiny. All those lines so sleek. What am I talking about? I don't need this. [walks off then reappears inside the shop in front of the spatula. Thinks] Maybe I do need this. [his eyes are shaped as a spatula]

8320,SpongeBob,72," Evening, sir. Hey, Granny, what's shakin? [walks into the Krusty Krab, passes Squidward] Ooh, breezy today.
",4
8321,Squidward,72," [Snickers] Nice outfit, SpongeBob! [laughs hysterically]
",4
8322,SpongeBob,72," Thanks, Squidward. It was worth every penny.

8323,Mr. Krabs,72," Whats all the lallygagging about?
",4
8324,Squidward,72," [still laughing] Mr. Krabs, get a load of SpongeBob.
",4
8325,Mr. Krabs,72," This better be good. [walks into the kitchen]

8326,SpongeBob,72," Soon everyone will know of your beauty.

",4
8329,Mr. Krabs,72," Le Spatula! What in blazes is that?
",4
8330,SpongeBob,72," Oh, just the answer to our little production dilemma. [Le Spatula glows]
",4
8331,Mr. Krabs,72," Well, what can it do?
",4
8332,Squidward,72," Can it make me famous?
",4
8333,SpongeBob,72," Anything you want and more. [pushes a button and the spatula spins]
",4
8334,Mr. Krabs,72," Ooh, that sounds excitin'. Let me have a go at it. [Reaches for Le Spatula]
",4
8335,SpongeBob,72," [Holds Le Spatula away from Mr. Krabs' reach] Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs, no can do.
",4
8336,Mr. Krabs,72," [shocked] What? Are you going against your commanding officer?
",4
8337,SpongeBob,72," No, it's not that. It's just that this is a highly developed piece of engineering that takes quality time to master.
",4
8338,Mr. Krabs,72," With that fancy machinery, I expect you to make Krabby Patties twice as fast.
",4
8339,SpongeBob,72," Oh, I don't think that'll be a problem, Mr. Krabs. In fact... [pushes a button and a bunch of spatulas appear]
",4
8340,Le Spatula,72," [says mechanically] Le Spatula 3000 at your service!
",4
8341,Mr. Krabs,72," Huh, impressive. Well, let's see that thing impress me even more by bringing in more customers and more money in me pocket. [laughs and walks away with Squidward]
",4
8342,SpongeBob,72," Oh, you won't believe what Le Spatula is capable of. Ready to show em buddy? [all the spatulas go into hiding] Oh, it's okay. No need to be shy. It's always tough the first day on the job. [scene cuts to outside the kitchen]
",4
8343,Martin,72," Uhh, can I get one Krabby Patty, please?
",4
8344,Squidward,72," SpongeBob, I need one Krabby Patty.
",4
8345,SpongeBob,72," [back in the kitchen] One Krabby Patty, coming up lickity split. [tries to use Le Spatula but every time he tries to flip the patty, the spatula goes another direction] Spat, is there something wrong, pal?
",4
8346,Le Spatula,72," I would not dare touch such slop as how do you say Krabby Patty. I am designed for the up most interesting cuisine. No less!
",4
8347,SpongeBob,72," But, but, I thought we were friends.
",4
8348,Le Spatula,72," Friends with you?! Ha! We are not even in the same social class. [jumps out of SpongeBob's arms and extends it legs to land on the floor] Have a nice life of mediocrity, fry cook! [runs out laughing]
",4
8349,SpongeBob,72," Le Spatula, wait. I gave up everything for you. We had something. [Le Spatula punches SpongeBob in the face]
",4
8350,Le Spatula,72," What's this for something? Au revoir, peasants! Have fun laboring in your greasy spoon. [spits and runs out]
",4
8351,Mr. Krabs,72," What happened?
",4
8352,SpongeBob,72," Le Spatula is gone, Mr. Krabs.
",4
8353,Mr Krabs,72," Well how are you gonna make Krabby Patties WITHOUT A SPATULA?!
",4
8354,SpongeBob,72," I had a spatula once. A real spatula. One that stood by me through thick and thin, through grease and gristle, and I betrayed his loyalty, like a fool!
",4
8355,Mr. Krabs,72," I always did like your old spatular. It got the job done every time.
",4
8356,SpongeBob,72," You're right, Mr. Krabs. The true measure of a good spatula is by his actions. Not by some fancy chrome and buttons. I gotta find my old spatula.
",4
8357,Mr. Krabs,72," Go to em. Go now, boy. Go before I lose all me customers. [starts to cry; scene cuts to the spatula's hospital bed from the start of the episode, with the pulse meter slowing, then becomes a flat line]
",4
8358,SpongeBob,72," Spatula?? It can't be true. It's too late! [cries]
",4
8359,Doctor,72," SpongeBob, I-I hate to tell you this...
",4
8360,SpongeBob,72," I know. He's moved on to the big kitchen drawer in the sky. Hes gone! [sobs]
",4
8361,Doctor,72," Actually, it's not that. I didn't get the acting part.
",4
8362,SpongeBob,72," Oh, I'm so sorry. [cries more]
",4
8363,Doctor,72," Oh, by the way, that's not your spatula. Your buddy's all patched up in the infirmary. [scene pans over to the Infirmary where Spat is in a wheelchair]
",4
8364,SpongeBob,72," [gasps] Spatula! [runs into the infirmary] Oh, buddy! Oh, I'm so glad you're better! [Spat turns around and ignores SpongeBob] Spatula, what's wrong? [spatula shakes its head] But I didn't mean to betray you. Mr Krabs needed a replacement. Krabby patties don't flip themselves, you know. It was a moment of weakness. I'm sorry-y-y-y! Oh, what have I done? What have I done? [begins crying and rolls. As he is doing this, another SpongeBob comes up into the scene]
",4
8365,SpongeBob,72," Good-bye, best friend.
",4
8366,SpongeBob,72," I'll never find another spatula like him, again which means the Krusty Krab is out of business. [notices a spatula flipping burgers by itself] Spatula? You're back! [SpongeBob jumps for spatula in slow motion, camera cuts to outer space] Oh, spatula, now that we're together again, nothing will ever separate us.
",4
8367,Squidward,72," One monster Krabby Patty. [the same real set of hands put a bunch of meat on the grill as before]
",4
8368,SpongeBob,72," Okay, buddy, we can do this. Ready? One, two, three. [SpongeBob's arms come off] D'oh! [laughs]",4

",4

",4
8391,Plankton,73," Guard away, my ex-enemy. I'll just be here starting my new competition-free career. [hums as Mr. Krabs walks away]
",4
8392,SpongeBob,73," What's going on Mr. Krabs?
",4
8393,Mr. Krabs,73," Plankton's concocting another hair-brained scheme to steal me recipe. So keep your eyes peeled.

",4
8397,SpongeBob,73," [holding a snow globe] Mr. Krabs, look at this cool knickknack I got at the Chumporium.
",4
8398,Mr. Krabs,73," [takes the snow globe] Hmm, I know there's a microphone or camera in here somewhere. [tries to open it]
",4
8399,SpongeBob,73," Uhh, Mr Krabs, I really don't think there's anything weird in there.
",4
8400,Mr. Krabs,73," Eh, we'll see about that. [walks to a door] I'll just put this in here for safekeeping. You here that, Plankton?! Join your other friends from the past. [throws snow globe into a room full of Plankton's past schemes, then locks the door] Now nobody's getting to see anything. Don't you understand this is all part of his ruse. It's just cosmetic. He thinks he can take us out. But we'll show him. We're gonna out-fake the faker. Well, it looks like old Plankton is really going through with it. I guess we don't have to worry about him anymore. Yup, we sure whipped him this time. Okay, boys, the coast is clear. Plankton's turned over a new leaf.
",4
8401,SpongeBob,73," That's some good news, Mr. Krabs.
",4

",4
8409,Plankton,73," [carrying a toy seal behind him] Come on, buddy, let's get some shut eye. We have a big day ahead of us at the Chumporium Gift Shop.
",4
8410,Mr. Krabs,73," Wait a minute. [sneaks over to the Chumporium] What the...? [sees a bunch of novelty items inside through the window] Store shelves? Novelty toys? Lava lamps? [gasps] Useless knickknacks? Very convincing. But I'm still not buying it. You want a battle, Plankton? I'm gonna give you a war. [scene cuts to Mr Krabs walking into the Chumporium. Plankton is dusting off his knickknacks]
",4
8411,Plankton,73," Ah. A clean snow globe is a happy snow globe. [laughs]

",4
8414,Mr. Krabs,73," Grr...
",4
8415,Plankton,73," But I found there more to life than just trying to steal your formula. And I found it all right here in novelty items.

",4
8417,Plankton,73," Ah, Eugene. Stuck in your old ways.
",4

",4
8419,Plankton,73," Thanks, but no.
",4
8420,Mr. Krabs,73," A-ha, I knew it. [chuckles] It was all a trick to get me to hand over... Wait, did you say no?

8422,Mr. Krabs,73," Problem?! I don't have a problem! You're the one with the problem! Look at this. It means nothing. It's all a facade, a hoax, a con, a front... [throws one of the shelves down. Plankton gasps] ...a sham, a snow job... [throwing snow globes onto the ground and breaking them] ...bologna with a side of flimflam and an order of Jive! See?! Who's the one with the problem?!
",4
8423,Plankton,73," Look what you've done. This is my livelihood.
",4
8424,Mr. Krabs,73," Sure it is. And this isn't the formula that you don't want. Come on, eh? Eh? Oop. Too slow. [chuckles]
",4
8425,Plankton,73," [very angry, screaming] GET OUT!!
",4
8426,Mr. Krabs,73," [gasps] Oh, I get it. Stick to your guns, and eventually we'll all believe it. Soften us up and when our backs are turned, you'll make your move. [drops the formula] Oops.
",4
8427,Plankton,73," What's this? [groans] Hey, Krabs!
",4
8428,Mr. Krabs,73," I knew you'd come back.
",4
8429,Plankton,73," You forgot something. [throws the formula back at Mr. Krabs] Can't you understand I've wasted so much time chasing after you? And now I have something that's mine. And it makes me happy. [walks off]
",4
8430,Mr. Krabs,73," I never thought I'd see the day. What happened to the invertebrate I used to know? Plankton! [cries loudly, he runs across the road and falls down crying some more. Scene cuts to night. Phone rings in the Chumporium as Plankton is taking a shower]
",4
8431,Plankton,73," Coming, coming. [answers] Yo.
",4
8432,Mr. Krabs,73," Uh, Plankton?
",4
8433,Plankton,73," Eugene?
",4
8434,Mr. Krabs,73," Uh, hey.
",4
8435,Plankton,73," Hey.
",4
8436,Mr. Krabs,73," Listen, uh, I just wanted to...you know...apologize for my behavior today. Wasn't right what I done. And I realized I hurt the feelings of, uh, someone I care about. You still there?
",4
8437,Plankton,73," Yes. I'm still here.
",4
8438,Mr. Krabs,73," Heh, good. Uh...I want to make it up to you. What do you say we grab a soda?
",4
8439,Plankton,73," Sure. [scene cuts to the next day at the Krusty Krab. Mr Krabs and Plankton are sitting at a table with sodas]
",4
8440,Mr. Krabs,73," Glad you could make it, buddy.
",4
8441,Plankton,73," So, what's this about, Krabs? [sips his soda]
",4
8442,Mr. Krabs,73," I figured since we're no longer archenemies, maybe, maybe we can start over.
",4
8443,Plankton,73," Yes. Yes, I would like that very much. [scene cuts to Mr Krabs and Plankton walking along the pier then playing pool] I guess I won. [both laugh. Scene cuts to both in a hot air balloon, on a slide, eating cotton candy, then at a trust booth]
",4
8444,Mr. Krabs,73," Uh, I don't know about this, Plankton.
",4
8445,Plankton,73," Oh, come on. Just fall back. Trust me, I'll catch you. [chuckles. Mr. Krabs falls back and Plankton strains to keep him up. Scene cuts to both sitting on the edge of the pier]
",4
8446,Mr. Krabs,73," That was truly amazing, Plank, old buddy. I guess I really can trust you 100%.
",4
8447,Plankton,73," Thanks, Eugene. That means a lot to me.
",4
8448,Mr. Krabs,73," And just to prove it to you, I want you to have something.
",4
8449,Plankton,73," Oh, no, no, come on now. No gifts.
",4
8450,Mr. Krabs,73," No, no. I want you to have this. It's the secret formula.
",4
8451,Plankton,73," I can't believe you would even think...
",4
8452,Mr. Krabs,73," Things are different now. Honestly. It would mean a lot to me.
",4
8453,Plankton,73," You...you're serious. Eugene, if I take this formula from you now, there will always be a hint of doubt.
",4
8454,Mr. Krabs,73," Come on, take it.
",4
8455,Plankton,73," You sure? [Mr. Krabs nods] Life is good, Krabs.
",4
8456,Mr. Krabs,73," Sure is buddy. Sure is. [screen fades to black. Plankton appears]
",4
8457,Plankton,73," Yeah, baby! This is it. Yeah! Whoo! [laughs. Runs into his Chumporium] I got it! I got it! My diabolical, extremely convoluted plan worked! I should've been a politician. [laughs. Opens up the formula to read ""GOTCHA! Love, Krabs"". Lights turn on]
",4
8458,Mr. Krabs,73, I never gave you the formula. I fooled you with an even more convoluted charade. [laughs and walks out. Plankton screams with frustrated anger],4

",4
8466,SpongeBob,74," Why, Mr. Krabs? What could be wrong on this fine day?
",4
8467,Mr. Krabs,74," Fine?! [grabs SpongeBob's mouth and ties it up] Today's not the day for that word, boy. Not after I received this letter from the Fry Cooks Union. It says here fry cook SpongeBob SquarePants has accumulated too much vacation time. And if you don't take some time off, I'll have to pay a fine. [cries]
",4
8468,SpongeBob,74," Time off?
",4
8469,Mr. Krabs,74," Oh, I guess there's no other way to say this...SpongeBob, take a vacation.

8474,SpongeBob,74," That's right, Gary, I am home early. I'm on vacation. Well, good night, Gary. [walks into his bed and closes his eyes for no more than two seconds before his alarm goes off. Scene cuts to him lifting his weights, eating cereal, flossing, showering, then putting on some spray to make him shine. He grabs his hat then walks into the Krusty Krab] Good morning, Krusty Krew! Hello, Squidward.
",4
8475,Squidward,74," I thought you were on vacation.
",4
8476,Mr. Krabs,74," [stops SpongeBob] He was and is. I told you to take a vacation, boy.
",4
8477,SpongeBob,74," What's a vacation?
",4
8478,Mr. Krabs,74," Well, a vacation is when you don't come into work.
",4
8479,SpongeBob,74," [gasps] No work?! But what'll I do all day?
",4
8480,Mr. Krabs,74," Oh, I dunno. Just go have fun or whatever. I really don't care. Ya just can't be here.
",4
8481,SpongeBob,74," But who will fry the patties and clean the grill while I'm gone? Squidward can't do it all alone.
",4
8482,Squidward,74," Nor will I.
",4
8483,Mr. Krabs,74," That's why I've hired an unpaid intern as your temporary replacement.
",4
8484,Patrick,74," [walks in] Good morning, boss. I'm ready for my first day.
",4
8485,Mr. Krabs,74," Speaking of starfish, here's your replacement right here.

8488,Mr. Krabs,74," That's enough banter on my dime.
",4
8489,Patrick,74," Ok, boss.
",4
8490,Mr. Krabs,74," Wait a second, Patrick. You'll need the right tools for the job. [takes SpongeBob's hat and spatula and gives it to Patrick]
",4
8491,Patrick,74," Wow. [notices his reflection in the spatula] Huh! They put a tiny me in the belly scratcher. [scratches his belly and his back] Wow. It scratches backs, too!
",4
8492,Mr. Krabs,74," Ah, take it from me, SpongeBob. Just go on home. Enjoy your vacation.
",4
8493,SpongeBob,74," I really should tell Patrick the proper patty-flipping technique. [Mr. Krabs shuts the doors in SpongeBob's face. Scene cuts to inside SpongeBob's house]

8494,Gary,74," Meow.
",4
8495,SpongeBob,74," I'm on vacation, Gary. I'm not allowed to go to work. [stomach growls then shrinks. SpongeBob gasps] My stomach has receded! Mr. Krabs said I couldn't work at the Krusty Krab. He didn't say I couldn't eat there. This is my ticket back inside! [scene cuts to Krusty Krab]
",4
8496,Squidward,74," Go away, SpongeBob. You're ruining my vacation...from you.
",4
8497,SpongeBob,74," I'm not here to see you, Squidward.
",4
8498,Mr. Krabs,74," SpongeBob, do we have to go through this again?
",4
8499,SpongeBob,74," I'm here as a customer not as an employee. Just gonna grab a Krabby Patty with Patrick.
",4
8500,Mr. Krabs,74," Alright, but lunch only. If you so much as touch a spatuler, you'll be vacationing in Davey Jones' locker.
",4
8501,SpongeBob,74," You have my word, sir. No working. [enters kitchen] Hey Pat, it's time for your lunch... [screams as he sees Patrick putting patties, attached to his body, on the grill] Patrick, you can't do that!
",4
8502,Patrick,74," Huh?
",4
8503,SpongeBob,74," You need to turn up the grill to exactly 298 degrees Fahrenheit. [turns the knob to the right from 297 to 298. Takes Patrick's spatula] Patrick, this is no way to treat a Krabby Patty.
",4
8504,Mr. Krabs,74," [storms into the kitchen] SpongeBob! What did I tell you about working?
",4
8505,SpongeBob,74," Wait, it's not what you think.
",4
8506,Mr. Krabs,74," [wheels SpongeBob on a dolly] Out you go, boy.
",4
8507,SpongeBob,74," But my knowledge could help Patrick maintain the high standards of the Krusty Krab.
",4
8508,Mr. Krabs,74," We've got it all under control here. I don't want to see hide or tail of ya 'til your vacation is over. You got that?
",4
8509,SpongeBob,74," Yes, Mr. Krabs.
",4
8510,Mr. Krabs,74," Well, boy... [launches SpongeBob off] off ya go! And don't come back 'til it's over. [scene cuts to SpongeBob entering his house]
",4
8511,SpongeBob,74," Oh, what to do, what to do. I know just the thing to get the spirits up. The official Krusty Krab playset. [sits down in front of a toy Krusty Krab with Krusty Krew figures. Opens it up]
",4
8512,Squidward,74," [SpongeBob imitating him] SpongeBob, I need 20 Krabby Patties on the double, please.
",4
8513,SpongeBob,74," Sure thing, Mr. Squidward, sir. 20 Krabby Patties coming up.
",4
8514,Mr. Krabs,74," [SpongeBob imitating him] SpongeBob, what are you doing here? You're gonna cost me some loot if you don't get your square keister home. Out, out, out until your vacation is over. [takes SpongeBob's Krusty hat off. SpongeBob walks home, sad]
",4
8515,SpongeBob,74," [walking inside his pineapple] Oh, what to do on this boring vacation. Hey, I know just the thing to get the ol' spirits up. [plays with a smaller Krusty Krab playset]
",4
8516,Squidward,74," [SpongeBob imitating him] I need 20 Krabby Patties, please.
",4
8517,SpongeBob,74," Sure thing, ol' buddy, ol' Squid. 20 Krabby Patties coming...
",4
8518,Gary,74," Meow.
",4
8519,SpongeBob,74," You're right, Gary. It is unhealthy to think of the Krusty Krab while I'm on vacation. I need to get out of the house. [scene cuts to Krusty Krab where Squidward is washing windows until he sees SpongeBob]
",4
8520,Squidward,74," Uh, Mr. Krabs, he's out there again.
",4
8521,Mr. Krabs,74," I'll deal with this. Boy, you're on Krusty Krab property. Back it up. [SpongeBob steps backwards] Further. [steps backwards more] Further. [steps backwards more] Further. [steps backwards more] Further. [steps backwards until he is in front of his house] That'll do.
",4
8522,SpongeBob,74," Mr. Krabs is right. In order to enjoy my vacation, I need to stay away from work. Physically and mentally. [looks at his net] Hey, that reminds me of... [his net turns into a spatula. Pretends to grill but stops] Hold it right there, Mr. WorkaholicPants. You're on vacation. You just need to sit down and relax. [floats onto the ground] That's more like it. Just sit back and watch the clouds. [watches a cloud go by] That one's a jellyfish! [another cloud goes by] That's a pirate ship. [another cloud goes by] And that's low salt ketchup...whoa! Low salt ketchup? [scene cuts to Krusty Krab where a delivery truck backs up. SpongeBob, in a disguise, walks up to the kitchen door] Got your steaming, hot bun delivery here. [another delivery truck backs up. A delivery fish gets out with the same buns on a plate]
",4
8523,Delivery Fish,74," Huh? What's the big idea, here? [SpongeBob laughs nervously then gets booted out. Scene cuts to the phone ringing inside the Krusty Krab. Patrick answers]
",4
8524,Patrick,74," Hello? Hello? Hello? [SpongeBob slips through phone cord and through Patrick's head but gets shot out of the Krusty Krab, through the doors. Scene cuts to the Krusty Krab restroom where Patrick is cleaning out his ear] Huh, I didn't even know I had an ear. [notices water splashing out from the toilet behind him] Hey, I just cleaned that one.
",4
8525,SpongeBob,74," Patrick, shhh.
",4
8526,Patrick,74," It talks! [screams and runs out]
",4
8527,SpongeBob,74," Somebody help, I'm stuck! [Mr. Krabs walks up] Mr. Krabs! Thank Neptune it's you. I'm in a bit of a fix here. [Mr. Krabs grabs a cord above the toilet] Mr. Krabs? [Mr. Krabs flushes the toilet] Noooo!! [gets flushed down the toilet. Scene cuts to SpongeBob jumping out of a customers shirt and into the grease fryer in the kitchen] Uh oh.
",4
8528,Mr. Krabs,74," Now what? [picks up the fryer and sees Spongebob small and deep fried] Tsk, tsk, tsk. [Spongebob then crumbles into crumbs and puts him in his boat out back] I've had enough for one day, son. [drives off]
",4
8529,SpongeBob,74," Thanks for the ride home, Mr. Krabs.
",4
8530,Mr. Krabs,74," Not a problem at all, me boy.
",4
8531,SpongeBob,74," Just take the next right. [Mr. Krabs drives past his house] Mr. Krabs, we just passed the turn off.
",4
8532,Mr. Krabs,74," Uh-huh.
",4
8533,SpongeBob,74," My house is back that way, Mr. K.
",4
8534,Mr. Krabs,74," Far out, little man. Far out. [drives into a forest and stops]
",4
8535,SpongeBob,74," Where'd you say you were taking me?
",4
8536,Mr. Krabs,74," Look boy, [takes out a spatula] I brought your spatuler. [SpongeBob glares at the spatula and acts like a dog] C'mon, boy, get it. Get the spatuler. Go get it! [throws the spatula into the forest. SpongeBob chases after it while Mr. Krabs turns around and drives off] Enjoy your vacation, boy!
",4
8537,SpongeBob,74," It's not fair. Why would Mr. Krabs try so hard to get rid of me? I'm only on vacation. Unless, it's a... [gasps] ...permanent vacation. That's it! Mr. Krabs wants to replace me. Oh, I should've known. Patrick's had his eye on my job all along. He's been scheming. They think I'm outdated. They think I'm all washed up. Well, I'll show them. [scene cuts to Patrick running down the street to his rock]
",4
8538,Patrick,74," Working at the Krusty Krab. Making krabby patties all day. Flipping Krusty Krab working patties krab...uhh, that's a hard song to remember. [opens his rock and jumps in] Huh?
",4
8539,SpongeBob,74," [sitting in the corner of Patrick's rock] Who do they think they are? I gave the best years of my life to this place and they think they can just fire like that? Like trash? I don't think so!
",4
8540,Patrick,74," SpongeBob? Is that you?
",4
8541,SpongeBob,74," [turns around with an evil look on his face] I've been waiting for you, Patrick! [walks towards Patrick, growling]
",4
8542,Patrick,74," SpongeBob, you're scaring me. Ahh! [SpongeBob laughs maniacally and closes in around Patrick. Scene cuts to Krusty Krab]
",4
8543,Customer,74," One krabby patty, please.
",4
8544,Squidward,74," One shell on a shingle. [Patrick gives Squidward the order then many orders come out, it blocks the window just for Mr. Krabs to notice]
",4
8545,Mr. Krabs,74," Well, I'll be...Patrick! Your cooking's improved one-thousand fold. Congratulations, boy, you've finally got the hang of it. [Patrick turns around, and it turns out to be SpongeBob in a Patrick costume] SpongeBob? No wonder. Patrick could never flip that many patties in an hour. What happened to that feller, anyway?
",4
8546,SpongeBob,74," Oh, I told him to stay home and watch television. [Patrick is sitting at home watching a broken TV]
",4
8547,Mr. Krabs,74," Why'd you do it, laddy?
",4
8548,SpongeBob,74," [starts to cry] Oh, Mr Krabs, I love the putrid grease of the Krusty Krab so much, I just couldn't stay away!
",4
8549,Mr. Krabs,74," You don't have to. [takes out a calendar] Your accumulated vacation time is used up. [tears up calendar] The union can't fine me, anymore.
",4
8550,SpongeBob,74," You must've saved a fortune.
",4
8551,Mr. Krabs,74," Bumping barnacles, yes. [laughs and holds up a dime] There she is.
",4
8552,SpongeBob,74," Wow! That's more than I make in a year.
",4
8553,Mr. Krabs,74," Don't be askin me for a raise. Just get back to work.
",4
8554,SpongeBob,74, [jumps out of the Patrick costume] Yippee! I happily acquiesce.,4

The shape is on its side. His brain, lungs, heart, and stomach shown.] This whole lab is called the Chamber of Shrinkage.

8598,SpongeBob,75," SpongeBob and Patrick reporting for guard duty. [They both laugh and jump inside. Patrick stars pressing buttons and SpongeBob pretends to be piloting the submarine.]
",4
8599,Patrick,75," Hmm. [He finds a yellow button with a label that reads. ""Shrink"".] ""Shrink."" I do have a lot of issues.
",4
8600,SpongeBob and Patrick,75," Pretty.
",4
8601,Sandy,75," I'm back, SpongeBob. [She drops box of nuts.] Uh-oh.
",4
8602,Patrick,75," You're so tiny. He shrinks even smaller than SpongeBob.] A giant SpongeBob!
",4
8603,Sandy,75," Patrick! SpongeBob!
",4
8604,Patrick,75," Sandy's grown to gigantic size!
",4
8605,SpongeBob,75," I don't think Sandy grew, Patrick. I think we shrunk.
",4
8606,Patrick,75," That's silly. Don't you think it's more likely that the entire world grew?
",4
8607,Sandy,75," Hi, Squidward. [Squidward wakes up.] Well, the submarine is safely inside you.
",4
8608,Squidward,75," Wonderful. Wait! If you're out here, then who's in here?
",4
8609,Sandy,75," Well, why don't you take a look for yourself?
",4
8610,Squidward,75," SpongeBob and Patrick are piloting a miniature submarine inside my head. SpongeBob and Patrick... SpongeBob and...
",4
8611,Sandy,75," You better calm down, Squidward. With them little critters inside you, I wouldn't be moving around too much. You could knock them into something important.
",4
8612,SpongeBob,75," [Off-screen] Where are we, Patrick?
",4
8613,Patrick,75," [Off-screen] I don't know, but it's a real dump.
",4
8614,Sandy,75," [over speaker] SpongeBob, Patrick, can you hear me?
",4
8615,SpongeBob,75," It's Sandy.
",4
8616,Patrick,75," She's in there? [He pulls out an ax.] I'll save you, Sandy!
",4
8617,Sandy,75," Stop it, you itty-bitty idiot!
",4
8618,SpongeBob,75," Sandy, where are you? Where are we?
",4
8619,Sandy,75," You're trespassing, SpongeBob -- in my lab, in my submarine -- and you're trespassing [The scene shows her at the speaker and Squidward in the background.] inside of Squidward.
",4
8620,Patrick,75," I thought this place was in bad shape.
",4
8621,Squidward,75," [over speaker] I heard that!
",4
8622,Sandy,75," [over speaker] Let's get you out of there, SpongeBob. All you need to do is locate the autopilot. It'll safely take you through your mission and then out the extraction point.
",4
8623,SpongeBob,75," Um...we broke it.
",4
8624,Sandy,75," Stop it! What are you trying to do? Kill him?
",4
8625,Sandy,75," [Over the speaker] This is approximately 17 times harder to drive than a boat mobile, which you've never successfully done. [She nervously chuckles. The scene shows Sandy.] So, just take it nice and easy.
",4
8626,SpongeBob,75," No problemo. Nice and...easy!
",4
8627,Squidward,75," So, how's it going? [The sound of a vehicle crashing is heard. SpongeBob reverse the submarine, but is stuck in Squidward's brain. He successfully does so and the submarine flies backwards. They hit the side of Squidward's interior cranium and then hit Squidward's brain and this repeats for a while. Squidward's eyes become out of control.] I can't control my eyeballs!
",4
8628,Sandy,75," Don't worry, it's temporary. Now, just sign this!
",4
8629,Squidward,75," Okay, now what is this?
",4
8630,Sandy,75," Oh, just your autograph for when you're, uh... famous.
",4
8631,Squidward,75," Oh, of course. I've got [He takes out images of him wearing a sweater and a black jacket, holding a pipe.] head shots, you know. [He hands gets out of control and drops the pictures.] What the...
",4
8632,Sandy,75," Squidward!
",4
8633,Squidward,75," What's happening? [Squidward's brain is shown. The submarine hits Squidward's brain stem repeatedly. SpongeBob and Patrick are shown fighting over the controls.]
",4
8634,SpongeBob,75," Give me that!
",4
8635,Patrick,75," No, give it back!
",4
8636,Sandy,75," They're hitting your central nervous system!
",4
8637,Squidward,75," Oh. Ya think?
",4
8638,Sandy,75," You're not in control of your actions! [Squidward kicks Sandy's thick butt] Hey!
",4
8639,Squidward,75," Oh, I'm sorry. I'm not in control of my actions.
",4
8640,Sandy,75," They've gone off course! [Squidward is flown off course. He is then shown spazzing out as the submarine enters his stomach.] Oh my gosh! You're out of control!
",4
8641,SpongeBob,75," Ew! Where are we? [Outside, Squidward's stomach rumbles. Inside, The submarine is getting dissolved in the green acid. Other food can also be seen being dissolved.] [As Patrick is screaming] Mayday! Mayday! We're sinking! And Patrick won't stop screaming!
",4
8642,Sandy,75," The stomach acid levels are way too high!
",4
8643,SpongeBob,75," The reserve tanks are almost empty. [Patrick grunts] Patrick!
",4
8644,Patrick,75," Finished.
",4
8645,Sandy,75," SpongeBob, you gotta get out of there! It's a straight shot up the stomach to the esophagus where the reed is! [A note plays] You can complete your mission if we can just access an alternative fuel. [through the speaker] Like natural gas.
",4
8646,SpongeBob,75," Natural gas?
",4
8647,Patrick,75," Like this!
",4
8648,Squidward,75," Stop burping inside me! That's disgusting!
",4
8649,Sandy,75," Wait a minute, Squidward. He might be on to something.
",4
8650,Squidward,75," What?
",4
8651,Sandy,75," If you can make a big enough burp...
",4
8652,Patrick,75," We can filter the CO2 through our ballast tanks, refire the engines, and ride the shock wave out of here!
",4
8653,SpongeBob,75," Wow.
",4
8654,Sandy,75," He's right.
",4
8655,Squidward,75," What?
",4
8656,Sandy,75," We're going through with your plan, Patrick!
",4
8657,SpongeBob,75," Yay!
",4
8658,Patrick,75," What plan?
",4
8659,Sandy,75," Now burp, Squidward! Lives are on the line!
",4
8660,SpongeBob,75," I never thought it would end this way. [Squidward burps loudly. A bubble forms below the submarine. It then engulfs the submarine. The reserve gas levels rise to maximum.] It's working!
",4
8661,SpongeBob and Patrick,75," Whee!
",4
8662,Sandy,75," They're headed for the esophagus. [She sniffs the air.] Phew, what have you been eating?
",4
8663,Squidward,75," Morons.
",4
8664,SpongeBob,75," SpongeBob to Sandy. We've reached the foreign obstruction.
",4
8665,Sandy,75," Okay, you're going to have to go out and dislodge it somehow.
",4
8666,SpongeBob,75," I'm already on it.
",4
8667,French Narrator,75," Two hours later.
",4
8668,SpongeBob,75," This stupid hammer won't break anything.
",4
8669,Patrick,75," SpongeBob, do what you were born to do! Dance!
",4
8670,SpongeBob,75," You're right Patrick. Whirlpool Spin! [He cuts the reed in half like a buzzsaw with the spin, causing Squidward to cough it up.]
",4
8671,Sandy,75," [Over the speaker] Good work, guys. Mission accomplished. [The scene returns to her.] Now all you have to do is...
",4
8672,Squidward,75," Get out of my body! Go!
",4
8673,Patrick,75," Grow?
",4
8674,"Sandy, Squidward, and SpongeBob",75," No!
",4
8675,Mr. Krabs,75," [Off-Screen] Almost ready to open. [The scene then shows him finishing up polishing a golden ""No refunds"" sign.] There.
",4
8676,Squidward,75," Good morning, Mr. Krabs.
",4
8677,Mr. Krabs,75," Hello, Squidward. Neptune's trousers! What's gotten into you? [The scene zoom out to show Squidward with a submarine-shaped body.]
",4
8678,SpongeBob,75," [inside Squidward] Reporting for Duty, Mr. Krabs.

8686,Squidward,76," It's too quiet. Something isn't right around here. [crawls around to SpongeBob's downstairs window. Peeks in but sees SpongeBob is not there] Could it be? SpongeBob is gone for the evening. [cut to Squidward in his house in a robe] Here's to a delightful evening alone with you, public television. [slurps his drink while watching Kelpy G on TV about to play his clarinet. When he does, SpongeBob's laughter is heard instead of a clarinet sound. SpongeBob and Patrick are outside playing]
",4
8687,Patrick,76," Do it again. Do it again.
",4
8688,SpongeBob,76," Ok. [puts two handfuls of sand in his mouth then squirts it out of his head like play-doh hair]
",4
8689,Squidward,76," Will you two be quiet?! I'm trying to watch public television. [closes window]
",4
8690,Patrick,76," Do it again, do it again.
",4
8691,Squidward,76," If those two want to ruin my quiet evening at home, they're going to have to do better than that. [watches more of the squid with the clarinet. Pounding on the door causes the music to stop. Squidward gets up and answers the door] What?
",4
8692,SpongeBob,76," Squidward! [Squidward slams door in their faces. Patrick sighs]
",4
8693,Squidward,76," You're still there, aren't you? [opens door]
",4
8694,SpongeBob,76," Good evening, Squidward.
",4
8695,Squidward,76," Not so fast. You two little monsters aren't about to ruin my evening.
",4
8696,SpongeBob,76," Oh, we're not here to ruin it. We're here to enhance it. Isn't that right, Pat?
",4
8697,Patrick,76," Yeah. We're here... [Squidward slams door]
",4
8698,Squidward,76," Can't a hard working Squid get a little TV time alone? [sits on his couch then notices SpongeBob and Patrick] SpongeBob? Patrick? Oh, what's the point? [SpongeBob and Patrick slurp their drink while watching the squid with the clarinet on TV]
",4
8699,Patrick,76," Could you turn it up?
",4
8700,SpongeBob,76," Uh, Squidward, could you turn it down a little?
",4
8701,Patrick,76," Squidward, what's this about?

",4
8711,Patrick,76," Oh wait, I think I've seen this before. This part's funny.
",4
8712,Squidward,76," I'm going to go somewhere far away. Somewhere far away from those two watching public television on my TV. Pfah! They wouldn't know real culture even if it hit them like a truck full of cement. [rides into a cement truck full of cement] Oh. [cement unloads on top of Squidward. Squidward tries to get unstuck and is launched through coral field, a sewer pipe, and into a colorful group of jellyfish, who sting him. The cement around him dries and becomes concrete. He falls over and screams out a bubble] Day five, I think. I've been waddling these fields. I'm hungry, tired, and lost. The only good thing about this is no SpongeBob. [reads sign] Jellyfish Fields. [sighs]
",4
8713,SpongeBob,76," What is that thing, Patrick?
",4
8714,Patrick,76," I dunno. Let's get a closer look. [both run up to the thing as it's trying to escape]
",4
8715,SpongeBob,76," Hi, stranger. I am SpongeBob. [sniffs in the odor coming from Squidward then flushes the tears away. Squidward growls muffling causing SpongeBob and Patrick to scream] Wait a minute. Maybe he's not a monster. Maybe he's an endangered species. We should help him.
",4
8716,Patrick,76," Yeah, help him. Go away. Can't you tell nobody wants you? You're endangered.
",4
8717,SpongeBob,76," Not like that. With lots of love and affection. We can take care of him. [muffled shouting coming from Squidward. Cut to SpongeBob's house] Well, Smelly, here you are. Your new home. Oh, Smelly, this is going to be great. We'll be one big happy family. Let me show you around. Here's your bed, Smelly. [muffled whimpering from Smelly] Here's your food bowl.
",4
8718,Patrick,76," And some kibble. [pours in some food]
",4
8719,SpongeBob,76," You can live here forever and ever. [Smelly cries] Oh, look, Pat. He's crying tears of joy. Well, Smelly, there's one more family member you haven't met. [retrieves Gary] Smelly meet Gary. [Gary sticks to Smelly] Aww, look at that Smelly, Gary likes you. [Gary screeches and attacks Smelly] Gary, no! [gets Gary off of Smelly] Gary. [Gary hisses]
",4
8720,Patrick,76," I don't think Gary likes Smelly.
",4
8721,SpongeBob,76," Yeah, Gary's never attacked anyone like that except Squidward. I guess Smelly can't live here.
",4
8722,Patrick,76," Ah! He can come home with me.
",4
8723,SpongeBob,76," That's a great idea, Patrick. You always wanted a pet. [Smelly tries to escape through the door but keeps falling down] Isn't that cute? Look how excited he is to get to your house. [opens door] Bye, Smelly, have fun at Patrick's. [Smelly tries to get into Squidward's house]
",4
8724,Patrick,76," No, no, Smelly. Squidward doesn't like pets. [cut to under Patrick's rock] Hey, Smelly, wanna play catch? [throws ball at Smelly] Don't worry, you'll get the hang of it. [throws ball at Smelly again] Almost. [throws ball at Smelly again] Again. [throws ball at Smelly again] So close. [throws ball at Smelly again but it gets stuck in his eye] Yeah, now you're... [Smelly throws the ball at Patrick, knocking him down] Smelly! What's gotten into you?! [screams and jumps behind a chair and calls someone] Hello, Animal Control? There's a wild animal loose in my house. [person over phone is speaking gibberish] Sure, I'll hold. [Smelly escapes Patrick's rock] Smelly! Come back. Smelly!
",4
8725,Police,76," Freeze! [more police cars arrive]
",4
8726,SpongeBob,76," [reading in his library] Hmmm, what's all the commotion? [looks outside the window]
",4
8727,Police,76," You're surrounded. There is no way out.
",4
8728,SpongeBob,76," Smelly. [tries walking through a crowd of policeman] Excuse me. Pardon me. If I can just scootch through there. Excuse me. Pardon me. Excuse me. You leave Smelly alone. He's just a poor, dumb wild animal.
",4
8729,Police,76," Wild animals don't belong here, son. They belong in the zoo. Get 'em boys. [Smelly is taken away in a truck marked 'ZOO' with a vicious, giant clam]
",4
8730,SpongeBob,76," Smelly. [cut to the zoo where people are around the habitat of Smelly. Smelly is locked behind a cage marked 'Species Unknown']
",4
8731,Isabelle,76," Mommy, what is that thing?
",4
8732,Sadie,76," I don't know but it's hideous, isn't it? [everyone laughs. Smelly goes back inside his cage]
",4
8733,SpongeBob,76," This isn't good.
",4
8734,Patrick,76," You're absolutely right. [takes out a hot dog] It needs mustard.
",4
8735,SpongeBob,76," No one should be treated like that. Not even someone as ugly as Smelly. Something needs to be done about this. And I know exactly what that thing is. [whispers to Patrick. Cut to night where Patrick and SpongeBob are wearing black ski masks] Ok, Patrick, remember the plan?
",4
8736,Patrick,76," Oh, yeah. [takes out a hotdog] This one, right?
",4
8737,SpongeBob,76," [grabs hotdog] No, not that. I'm talking about the plan to break Smelly out of this animal prison.
",4
8738,Patrick,76," [takes a bite out of the hotdog] Mmm, good plan.
",4
8739,SpongeBob,76," [ties rope to rail] All right, I'll go down first. Keep a lookout and follow me. [climbs down the rope]
",4
8740,Patrick,76," You're my hero. [gets tangled in the rope] SpongeBob! Help! Ah! [screams and makes lots of noise]
",4
8741,SpongeBob,76," Shh, we'll get caught.
",4
8742,Patrick,76," What! I can't hear you! I'm screaming too loud! [SpongeBob pulls the rope which causes Patrick to fall straight to the ground which, in turn, wakes up Smelly]
",4
8743,SpongeBob,76," [tip-toes over to Smelly's cage] Fear no longer, dear Smelly, we are here to rescue you. Understand? We are taking you home. [draws a home with his fingers. Smelly moans] Look how excited he is. Flip the switch, Patrick. [he does so. Cage door opens and they carry him out] Smelly, you're free! [lights are shining on them, they jump out a little with a seal barking sound]
",4
8744,Police,76," You're surrounded. There's no use trying to run.
",4
8745,SpongeBob,76," Run, Patrick, run! [as they do, the police climb down into the habitat and chase them] Faster, Patrick. [notices a manhole cover and opens it]
",4
8746,Patrick,76," I'll let Smelly go first. [throws Smelly down the sewer. Smelly bounces around before hitting the ground]
",4
8747,SpongeBob,76," Don't worry, Smelly, you're safe with us. [Patrick closes the manhole cover as police run by it]
",4
8748,Patrick,76," I think we lost them.
",4
8749,SpongeBob,76," Well, we're all one big happy family again. Let's see where this dark sewer tunnel leads.
",4
8750,SpongeBob and Patrick,76," La-la, la-la, la-la, la-la. [Smelly moans and whimpers]
",4
8751,SpongeBob,76," Oh, it's all right, Smelly. Soon, we'll be home and you can sleep in that cozy little pet carrier you love so much. [muffled screaming and wailing from Smelly]
",4
8752,Patrick,76," Hey, I see light.
",4
8753,SpongeBob,76," You're right, Patrick. That must be the way out. Whoa... where are we? [a group of creatures are gathered around in the distance] Let's go ask those guys. Um, excuse us. [creatures turn around to reveal they look like Smelly] Hey, they look just like you. Go, be with your real family. Go ahead, Smelly. I know you've come to think of us as a family, but it's better this way. [push Smelly on the ground as the group of creatures take him away]
",4
8754,Patrick,76," [sniffs] I'm going to miss him, SpongeBob. Me, too, buddy. Me, too, but he's with his kind now, where he belongs, and on that note, let us go back to where we belong. [group of gray creatures put Smelly down to where the Squid on TV from earlier is playing jazz]
",4
8755,Kelpy G,76," Ah... salutation, my children. Are you ready for your daily dose of smooth jazz? [excited murmuring from the creature. Kelpy G plays. As he is playing Smelly's exterior breaks and reveals Squidward underneath]
",4

8805,Patrick,77," Ready. [banner comes down which says ""CONGRATULATIONS"" on it. Balloons and confetti fall]
",4
8806,SpongeBob,77," Huh?
",4
8807,Fish,77," Congratulations, Mr. Star. You're the one millionth person to pass the test.
",4
8808,Patrick,77," Does that mean I get a free key chain?
",4
8809,Fish,77," Uhh, no.
",4
8810,Patrick,77," Oh.
",4
8811,Fish,77," You get a brand-new boat mobile. The new Bass Blaster 3000. The ultimate boating machine.
",4
8812,Patrick,77," Yeah! All right!
",4
8813,Fish,77," Women will want you. [all faint] Men will want to be you. [all sigh] You'll be the envy of your friends. [SpongeBob groans]
",4
8814,Patrick,77," Isn't this great? I got my license and a new boat.
",4
8815,SpongeBob,77," I'm so happy for you... [""La Cucaracha"" horn blows in his face] Whoa!
",4
8816,Patrick,77," The horn works. [scene cuts to Patrick driving his new boat down the road] Whoo! This is the greatest day ever. Right, SpongeBob?
",4
8817,SpongeBob,77," Right, Patrick. I can't think of one thing that would make this day better. Except maybe getting my license.
",4
8818,Patrick,77," Maybe if you apply yourself you could be the two millionth person to get his license.
",4
8819,SpongeBob,77," Two millionth?
",4
8820,Patrick,77," Then you can get a free boat just like me.
",4
8821,SpongeBob,77," Yeah, just like you.
",4
8822,Patrick,77," I try to serve as an inspiration to others.
",4
8823,SpongeBob,77," Can we go home now? [zoom out and scene shows Patrick driving around his rock over and over] We've been driving around your house for hours.
",4
8824,Patrick,77," I know. It's a lot faster than walking, isn't it?
",4
8825,SpongeBob,77," Thanks for the ride, Patrick.
",4
8826,SpongeBob,77," Patrick, what are you doing?
",4
8827,Patrick,77," You will never guess what happen to me today.
",4
8828,SpongeBob,77," You got your license.
",4
8829,Patrick,77," Yeah! [shows his license] But that's not all.
",4
8830,SpongeBob,77," You got a new boat.
",4
8831,Patrick,77," Yeah. Have you been following me? You know, you need to get your own life. [walks off]
",4
8832,SpongeBob,77," [gets back into bed] Oh... I just need a few minutes sleep. [foghorn alarm blows]
",4
8833,Gary,77," Meow.
",4
8834,SpongeBob,77," Yes, Gary, I saw his new boat. [scene cuts to morning where SpongeBob is leaving home to go to work] I'm so tired. [horn honks]
",4
8835,Patrick,77," Hey, buddy. Need a ride to work?
",4
8836,SpongeBob,77," Thanks, Patrick, but I'd rather walk to work. [tries to take a step but falls down in the process. Scene cuts to Patrick driving SpongeBob to the Krusty Krab]
",4
8837,Patrick,77," Boy, I never realized how empty life is without a license.
",4
8838,SpongeBob,77," Thanks for the ride.
",4
8839,Patrick,77," No problem, buddy. You can give me rides once you get your license. I mean, if you get your license. [SpongeBob is getting very angry]
",4
8840,SpongeBob,77," That's it. I am through driving around with Patrick. If I have to see one more boat mobile...
",4
8841,Mr. Krabs,77," SpongeBob, you're manning the drive-thru.
",4
8842,SpongeBob,77," When did we get a drive-thru?
",4
8843,Mr. Krabs,77," I realized there's a lot of young people on the go these days. They don't have time to sit down and eat. They're too busy out on the open road living their dreams.
",4
8844,SpongeBob,77," I used to have a dream.
",4
8845,Mr. Krabs,77," Yeah? I used to have a kidney stone. Everything passes eventually. Now stop dreaming and work for a living.
",4
8846,SpongeBob,77," [through headphones] Welcome to the Krusty Krab, may I— [""La Cucaracha"" horn honks]
",4
8847,Patrick,77," The horn still works. [scene cuts to SpongeBob switching the OPEN sign to CLOSED then walking out of work. Patrick drives up in a racing uniform] Hey, SpongeBob.
",4
8848,SpongeBob,77," What's with the helmet, Patrick?
",4
8849,Patrick,77," Well, since I'm now an expert driver, I have to keep up my image. [clicks tongue]
",4
8850,SpongeBob,77," Uh-huh. [scene cuts to Patrick driving]
",4
8851,Patrick,77," Boy, driving is so easy.
",4
8852,SpongeBob,77," Oh?
",4
8853,Patrick,77," Do you want me to give you lessons?
",4
8854,SpongeBob,77," [sarcastic] Oh, that would be great.
",4
8855,Patrick,77," Oh! [drives over to SpongeBob's parents]
",4
8856,SpongeBob,77," Patrick!
",4
8857,Patrick,77," Hi, mommy. Hi, daddy.
",4
8858,Mr. SquarePants,77," Patrick, how many times do we have to tell you we're SpongeBob's mom and dad, not yours?
",4
8859,Patrick,77," What? I'm an orphan? Oh, but guess what? I passed my driver's test.
",4
8860,Mrs. SquarePants,77," That's great, Patrick.
",4
8861,Patrick,77," SpongeBob failed his test, so don't mention it.
",4
8862,Mrs. SquarePants,77," Oh, we know how to stay clear of that minefield.
",4
8863,SpongeBob,77," Mom!
",4
8864,Patrick,77," Well, I've got to take Mr. Walks-a-lot back home. He's always asking for rides.
",4
8865,SpongeBob,77," Hey. [Patrick drives off]
",4
8866,Mr. SquarePants,77," Even Patrick has a license. [both parents sigh]
",4
8867,Patrick,77," Let's see what this baby can do. [steps on the gas. Ride pass a sign that reads 'SPEED LIMIT 40 MPH']
",4
8868,SpongeBob,77," Patrick, the speed limit is 40mph.
",4
8869,Patrick,77," Yeah, yeah.
",4
8870,SpongeBob,77," [reads the speedometer] 40.5mph? That's almost 41mph. He's speeding. Patrick! Stop this car. [car stops next to a policeman]
",4
8871,Patrick,77," What? Where? Who?
",4
8872,SpongeBob,77," Officer, it is my civilian duty to report that the the driver of this vehicle is speeding. Why don't you clock him with your radar gun?
",4
8873,Officer,77," Umm... okay. [uses radar gun. It reads 0mph] Actually, he's going 40mph under the limit. So, move along before I run you in, tattletale. [drives off]
",4
8874,SpongeBob,77," Are you sure you don't want to run him in? [scene cuts to Patrick driving. Green light turns red] It's a red light, Patrick! [Patrick runs through red lights] Patrick, you just ran 3 red lights!
",4
8875,Patrick,77," So?
",4
8876,SpongeBob,77," You're suppose to stop!
",4
8877,Patrick,77," I think the driving genius knows what he's doing!
",4
8878,SpongeBob,77," [finally snaps] Driving genius?! Why would a genius make an illegal u-turn... through an orphanage?!
",4
8879,Patrick,77," They ran for it in time. What are you so mad about?
",4
8880,SpongeBob,77," I should've gotten that license, and this should be my boat mobile!
",4
8881,Patrick,77," How can you say that?! If you were my friend, you'd be happy for me getting my license!
",4
8882,SpongeBob,77," If you were my friend, you wouldn't rub your license in my face!
",4
8883,Patrick,77," I'm not rubbing my license in your face! This is rubbing my license in your face! [takes out license and rubs it in SpongeBob's face, which makes muffled noises]
",4
8884,SpongeBob,77," Oh, give me that! I worked my whole life for this! You don't deserve this! [tears up Patrick's license then laughs. The pieces of the license fly into the officers hands]
",4
8885,Officer,77," Huh, litterbugs. This is why I joined the force. [drives off after SpongeBob & Patrick]
",4
8886,SpongeBob & Patrick,77," It's the police!
",4
8887,Officer,77," [over speaker] Pull it over, litterbug!
",4
8888,Patrick,77," Litterbug?! No! [drives faster]
",4
8889,Officer,77," Ooh, I got me a runner. [a bunch of police cars are following him]
",4
8890,SpongeBob,77," Patrick, what do you think you're doing?
",4
8891,Patrick,77," I don't know! I don't have a license anymore. [drives around cards, through a sign then off a cliff into the front lot of the Bikini Bottom Jail. Scene cuts to courtroom]
",4
8892,Judge,77," 90 days. I hope you learned a valuable lesson about littering.
",4
8893,Patrick,77," So long, buddy. Don't forget to feed Gary. Sometimes you forget to feed him.
",4
8894,SpongeBob,77," What have I done? Patrick can't survive in prison. He's too soft. Wait! [runs up to the judge] Patrick's innocent. I tore up Patrick's license and threw it out the window. I'm the litterbug. Take me instead.
",4
8895,Judge,77," Well, considering there's no legal precedent... oh, what the heck. 90 days! [SpongeBob is put in jail]
",4
8896,Narrator,77," One debt to society later... [door buzzes. SpongeBob is let go out of jail where Patrick is waiting for him]
",4
8897,SpongeBob,77," Patrick!
",4
8898,Patrick,77," SpongeBob! [both hug]
",4
8899,Patrick,77," Oh, I don't have a boat mobile anymore.
",4
8900,SpongeBob,77," What?
",4
8901,Patrick,77," It stopped working so I threw it away. The needle was on E and I figured that must mean end.
",4
8902,SpongeBob,77," Oh, then what do we do with this? [Patrick takes it and puts it on his behind]
",4
8903,Patrick,77," How's that?
",4
8904,SpongeBob,77," Yeah!
",4
8905,Patrick,77," Ready, buddy?

[motorcycles approaching. As they do, SpongeBob hangs onto ones jacket] The ""Ild Ones""! That's a strange name. [jacket tears] Scallop!! [rolls in the cement] Bye ""Ild Ones"". I like your silly name. Hmm...""w"". Oh, oh, they're not the ""Ild Ones"". They must be the ""Wild Ones"".

",4
8915,SpongeBob,78," No; I don't know who you are, either.

8917,SpongeBob,78," Bloodthirsty bikers? And they're headed straight for Bikini Bottom! I've got to warn everybody! I better take the shortcut! [as the next scene of bubbles comes up, so does SpongeBob. Bubble pops in the Krusty Krab] Mr. Krabs!
",4
8918,Mr. Krabs,78," SpongeBob! Where in the blue barnacles did you come from?
",4
8919,SpongeBob,78," There's no time for that, Mr. Krabs. Grab something heavy! Bar the door! Board up the windows. We've got to protect the Krusty Krab. The Krabby Patties must survive!
",4
8920,Mr. Krabs,78," Settle down, son. What are you all riled up about?

8921,SpongeBob,78," Bikers... coming... nasty... ferocious... take... over... town. Destroy... must hide!

8924,Mr. Krabs,78," Ravenous did you say? That's another word for hungry, isn't it? [cut to later where a sign hangs that reads 'WELCOME WILD ONES!'] Welcome Wild Ones! They'll be drawn here like a sailor at a tattoo parlor. With the special biker parking and authentic biker decor, with real bloodstains. And to top it off, a custom chopper patty. And best of all, I'll raise me prices 150%. I'll make a fortune.
",4
8925,SpongeBob,78," Mr. Krabs, this is serious! [crying]

8926,Mr. Krabs,78," That kid needs a vacation -- unpaid of course. [cut to The Wild Ones 25 miles from Bikini Bottom. Cut to SpongeBob in front of Squidward's house]

",4
8943,Giant Clam #2,78," Hey, what happened to you?
",4
8944,Giant Clam #1,78," [groaning] I... I don't want to talk about it, man. [SpongeBob and Patrick fly through some kelp grass. As they hide in it, a mower comes by and mows them over then uses a leaf blower to blow them into a pile. Both reform into their shapes and scream more]

8953,Patrick,78," No! No more running.
",4

",4
8955,Patrick,78," Those bikers think they're so tough. With their leather hats [holds his pants] and their leather pants [points to head]
",4
8956,SpongeBob,78," [holds up a black sock] And their leather socks.
",4
8957,Patrick,78," If we dressed up like that then we'd be the big, scary bikers and they'd be little baby doody-heads.
",4
8958,SpongeBob,78," Say that again, Patrick.
",4
8959,Patrick,78," Little baby doody-heads?
",4
8960,SpongeBob,78," No, no, not that part. The part about dressing up like big, scary bikers. [Scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick putting on biker clothes. SpongeBob and Patrick put on biker pants, SpongeBob stretches his barefeet toes out to put on his biking boots, Patrick puts on a bike jacket, and then they put on biking helmets] What do you think, Patrick? Do I look though?
",4
8961,Patrick,78," I wouldn't mess with ya.
",4
8962,SpongeBob,78," Nor I with you, my friend. Let's ride. [cut to later where Patrick and SpongeBob are revving their engines. Zoom out to show they are riding bicycles] Fear not. There is no need to panic. The Bikini Bottom bad boys are here.
",4
8963,Harold,78," Ooh, I feel protected now.
",4
8964,Scooter,78," Those are some mean looking rides, dudes. [chuckles]

8967,SpongeBob,78," Patrick, that's your salivation.

8968,Patrick,78," Oh.
",4
8969,SpongeBob,78," So, Squidward, are you ready to do your part?
",4
8970,Squidward,78," Does that part include laughing at you? Cause you two look even more idiotic than usual.
",4
8971,SpongeBob,78," Don't we look vicious and bloodthirsty?
",4
8972,Patrick,78," I'm bloodthirsty. See? [shows a cup with the word 'BLOOD' on it. He takes a sip] Want some?
",4
8973,SpongeBob,78," Oh, no thank you, Patrick. I'm drinking diet blood. [both take sips of their drinks] See Squidward? We walk the walk but can we talk the talk? Do you want to join our biker gang?
",4
8974,Squidward,78," No, I don't.
",4
8975,Patrick,78," What about our biker club?
",4
8976,Squidward,78," No.
",4
8977,SpongeBob,78," How about our biker organization?
",4
8978,Squidward,78," No! I don't want to join your biker alliance, outfits, or your fellowships.
",4
8979,SpongeBob,78," What about our coalition?
",4
8980,Patrick,78," Ooh, I don't know. That one's pretty exclusive.
",4
8981,SpongeBob,78," [takes out clipboard] We'll just put you down as undecided. [Squidward groans and walks away] Hi, Mr. Krabs. We're the Bikini Bottom bad boys and we're bad to the bone.
",4
8982,Mr. Krabs,78," This'll be great. Those bikers can work up an appetite beating you up in the parking lot. Then they can fill up on delicious Krabby Patties then they can beat you up again.
",4
8983,SpongeBob,78," Please, Mr. Krabs. We're going to run off those bikers and save the Krusty Krab.
",4
8984,Mr. Krabs,78," You're not running off any of me paying customers. You can stay and get beat up in the parking lot if you wish.
",4
8985,SpongeBob,78," Then can we save the town?
",4
8986,Squidward,78," Has it ever crossed your mind that you might be getting all worked up over nothing?
",4
8987,SpongeBob,78," Squidward, when have I ever been known to over-react? [flashback] Squidward! We're out of napkins! [screams] Out of napkins! [another flashback to SpongeBob banging on Squidward's door] Squidward! I accidentally removed the ""Do No Remove by Penalty of Law"" tag on my mattress! Hide me. Hide me. [another flashback] Squidward! Squidward! I've gone blind. [Squidward turns on lights] Oh. Thanks, Squidward. [back to present]
",4
8988,Squidward,78," SpongeBob, you always over-react to everything. One of your many annoying traits.
",4
8989,SpongeBob,78," [gasps] Me? Annoying? [annoying laughter. Squidward growls] Yeah right.
",4
8990,Squidward,78," You are so wrong about everything, SpongeBob, that the only thing that I am completely sure about is that there is no motorcycle gang headed this way. [motorcycles approaching] What was that?
",4
8991,Mr. Krabs,78," Ahoy there, mateys. Motorcycle vehicles headed over the horizon.
",4
8992,Squidward,78," What? [grabs binoculars] Gimme that. [sees them coming. His eyes pop through the binoculars as he screams] Don't just stand there, save us.
",4
8993,SpongeBob,78," Patrick, I know this looks like the end, but you and I can get through anything. As long as do it together. [Patrick is already running away] Patrick? Patrick! [Patrick is headed into Jellyfish Fields and to the bus stop where a bus picks him up and takes him to a plane. Patrick jumps out of the plane and onto a rocket ship] Well, it's just you and me, Squidward. But I want you to know that we can get through this. As long as we...
",4
8994,Squidward,78," Panic! Run for your lives! [customers gasp] The Wild Ones are coming! [everyone screams and runs]
",4
8995,Lenny,78," The Wild Ones? [jumps into a sardine box] Mable, get the kids! [Mable jumps into the sardine box with Susie and Tyler and then closes it]
",4
8996,Charlie,78," Honey, I got the napkins. Oh, what I have missed this time?
",4
8997,Squidward,78," [running out of the Krusty Krab] Please don't kill me. I want to join you. It's been my life-long dream to be to be a member of a motorcycle gang. I even knitted my own Wild Ones jacket. [shows a shirt with a skull on it] I want to ride to live and live to ride. [screams as the bikers ride in a circle around him] I'll do whatever you want. I'll betray my friends and neighbors. Just let me live.

8998,Biker #1,78," What's that, missy?

8999,Biker #2,78," What?

9003,Mr. Krabs,78," Don't you want to spend any money?

9004,Biker #1,78," Don't you want to kiss the seat of my pants? Let's ride. [bikers ride off]
",4
9005,SpongeBob,78," Good-bye. They seem really nice. Hey, where's Squidward?
",4

9018,SpongeBob,79," Ah, that was the most beautiful day of jellyfishing ever.
",4
9019,Patrick,79," Well, I didn't catch a thing with my dumb old net. [his net breaks]
",4
9020,SpongeBob,79," Lucky for me, I have Ol' Reliable! Carbon fiber handle, titanium alloid netting and form-fitting silicone grips. Yes, sir, Ol' Reliable is the best net in the world.
",4
9021,Patrick,79," Wow! I would kill for a net like that! You know, something small like a carrot. But not spiders, they're icky. [shudders. Scene cuts to the bus dropping off Patrick and SpongeBob on their street]
",4
9022,SpongeBob,79," Good night, Patrick.
",4
9023,Patrick,79," Good night, SpongeBob.
",4
9024,SpongeBob,79," [in his bed] Ah, I love jellyfishing. [night breaks into day quickly and the foghorn alarm goes off] Whoo! Time to get ready for day two of the jellyfish migration. And I'll start with my trusty jellyfishing net, Ol' Reliable. [realizes he doesn't have it] Ol' Reliable? [gasps] It's gone! [runs out the door in his underwear]
",4
9025,Gary,79," Meow?
",4
9026,SpongeBob,79," Oh, right. Pants.
",4
9027,Narrator,79," One pair of pants later...
",4
9028,SpongeBob,79," Patrick, Ol' Reliable has been stolen! [both scream. Scene cuts to them stapling posters saying ""STOLEN! OL' RELIABLE""]
",4
9029,SpongeBob,79," Put one over there, Patrick.
",4
9030,Patrick,79," I'm all done.
",4
9031,SpongeBob,79," Maybe we should spread out a little. [newspaper ad of the ""Bikini Bottom Gazette"" reads ""STOLEN OL' RELIABLE"" on the front page]
",4
9032,Johnny,79," Flash. The jellyfish migration enters it second day of fantastic jellyfishing. We now go live to our reporter on the scene.
",4
9033,Perch Perkins,79," [in Jellyfish Fields] This year's migration is the largest in a century! I feel truly sorry for the poor saps that will miss even one minute of this remarkable event. [SpongeBob takes Perch's microphone]
",4
9034,SpongeBob,79," Attention, Bikini Bottom, my jellyfishing net has been stolen. I am prepared to offer a large reward for its safe return. [Mr. Krabs sees this on TV at home and runs to Jellyfish Fields then appears on TV instantly]
",4
9035,Mr. Krabs,79," Reward? How much we talkin' about?
",4
9036,SpongeBob,79," 12 dollars and... [counts the coins] ...38 cents.
",4
9037,Mr. Krabs,79," I'm on the case. [takes SpongeBob's money and runs off screen while Perch takes back his microphone]
",4
9038,Perch Perkins,79," Guys, I know it's a slow news day, but come on. [scene cuts to SpongeBob sitting in his chair by the phone when it rings. He picks it up]
",4
9039,SpongeBob,79," Oh! Hello? Hello?
",4
9040,Patrick,79," SpongeBob, did you get your net back?
",4
9041,SpongeBob,79," Oh, get off the line, Patrick. Someone might be trying to call about Ol' Reliable!
",4
9042,Patrick,79," Oh, sorry. [hangs up. The phone rings again] Did you get your net yet?
",4
9043,SpongeBob,79," No, Patrick. Don't call unless you found my net. [hangs up. The phone rings again]
",4
9044,SpongeBob,79," Hello?
",4
9045,Patrick,79," SpongeBob, I found your net!
",4
9046,SpongeBob,79," What! Really?
",4
9047,Patrick,79," Uhh, oh, not really. I just got lonely.
",4
9048,SpongeBob,79," Oh, I'll never get my net back. I'll just have to accept that Ol' Reliable is gone forever. [looks out his window and notices Patrick running around with a jellyfish net]
",4
9049,SpongeBob,79," [sighs] Patrick's lucky. He gets to practice in the middle of the night with his jellyfish net. [gets in bed] Funny thing is, Patrick's net disintegrated yesterday. [his eyes widen. Scene cuts to morning. Patrick walks up to SpongeBob's pineapple]
",4
9050,Patrick,79," Hey, SpongeBob, did you get Ol' Reliable back yet?
",4
9051,SpongeBob,79," [sighs] No, not yet. Hey, Patrick, wouldn't it be the funniest thing if you had taken my jellyfish net? [Patrick laughs then stops]
",4
9052,Patrick,79," No. [SpongeBob laughs]
",4
9053,SpongeBob,79," Yeah, that would be silly. Oh, that reminds me. I got you a present.
",4
9054,Patrick,79," A present? What is it?
",4
9055,SpongeBob,79," [pulls out a bear with a microphone in its hand] It's a Confess-A-Bear. He's a special friend you tell all your secrets to.
",4
9056,Patrick,79," Wow, thanks, SpongeBob!
",4
9057,SpongeBob,79," I'll just leave you two alone to get acquainted.
",4
9058,Confess-A-Bear,79," Hi! My name is Confess-A-Bear! Tell me all your secrets.
",4
9059,Patrick,79," Um, I did something recently I'm not very proud of. I didn't mean to do it. It just sort of happened.
",4
9060,Confess-A-Bear,79," Hmmm, maybe you should talk about it.
",4
9061,Patrick,79," Well, it involves my best friend SpongeBob. I don't think he knows what happened, but it would really upset him if he found out.
",4
9062,Confess-A-Bear,79," Tell Confess-A-Bear!
",4
9063,Patrick,79," I've said too much already.
",4
9064,Confess-a-Bear,79," Tell Confess-A-Bear now! Now!
",4
9065,Patrick,79," Ahh! I accidentally knocked SpongeBob's toothbrush in the toilet and put it back on the counter without washing it! Confess-A-Bear? [SpongeBob runs around in the background wiping his tongue off and screaming] You're mad at me, aren't you, Confess-A-Bear? [scene cuts to SpongeBob walking up to Patrick's rock]
",4
9066,SpongeBob,79," Patrick, we need to talk.
",4
9067,Patrick,79," Uh, don't come in! I'm not decent! The house is a mess! There's a radiation leak!
",4
9068,SpongeBob,79," Hmmm... [walks down some stairs into Patrick's rock] Patrick, where are you? Why are the lights off?
",4
9069,Patrick,79," I'm in here. Be out in a second. [Patrick's shadow reveals himself holding a jellyfishing net]
",4
9070,SpongeBob,79," Ol' Reliable! Ah...ha.
",4
9071,Patrick,79," [Standing with his hands behind his back] Hello.
",4
9072,SpongeBob,79," What's in your hand, Patrick?
",4
9073,Patrick,79," [shows his left hand] Nothing.
",4
9074,SpongeBob,79," What's in your other hand?
",4
9075,Patrick,79," [grows another arm through his chest] Nothing in my other hand.
",4
9076,SpongeBob,79," Well, I gotta go.
",4
9077,Patrick,79," Ok, bye.
",4
9078,SpongeBob,79," Patrick wouldn't steal Ol' Reliable. Would he? [imagines Patrick from earlier]
",4
9079,Patrick,79," I would kill for a net like that! [takes out a carrot, breaks it in half, and laughs maniacally]
",4
9080,SpongeBob,79," [screams] Have I been best friends with a master thief? I must know for sure. [scene cuts to the next day] Good morning, Patrick.
",4
9081,Patrick,79," Good morning, SpongeBob.
",4
9082,SpongeBob,79," What are you going to do today, buddy?
",4
9083,Patrick,79," Eh, nothing.
",4
9084,SpongeBob,79," [puts on his Krusty Krab hat] Well, I'm off to work. See ya later, Patrick.
",4
9085,Patrick,79," Bye. [SpongeBob walks off then sneaks into a bush in the background]
",4
9086,SpongeBob,79," Now, we'll just see what sort of nothing you're really up to, Sneaky McSneakyPants. [looks through binoculars]
",4
9087,Narrator,79," 8 hours later...
",4
9088,SpongeBob,79," [still looking through binoculars] Oh, he is good. You never really know a guy until you stare at him for eight hours through high-powered binoculars. Hey, where'd he go? [Patrick is behind him]
",4
9089,Patrick,79," Hi, SpongeBob. What are you doing?
",4
9090,SpongeBob,79," Uh, you... what the...? What are you doing?
",4
9091,Patrick,79," Nothing. I just finished. [takes out his to-do list and crosses out 'Nothing'] Oh, hey, look. You can see where I was just standing from here. Boy, if you wanted to, you could have spied on me all day from right here. [shudder] Creepy, huh? Anyway, what are you doing with those binoculars?
",4
9092,SpongeBob,79," [yells and throws away the binoculars] I don't have any binoculars, see?
",4
9093,Patrick,79," You're acting weird.
",4
9094,SpongeBob,79," I'm not acting weird! [runs off panting] You're acting weird! You're... acting... weird!
",4
9095,Patrick,79," OK, bye! [later, SpongeBob knocks on Patrick's rock] Hello! Who are you?
",4
9096,SpongeBob,79," [wearing a mustache] Greetings, young fellow! I am willing to pay top dollar for jellyfishing items with sentimental value, if you know what I mean.
",4
9097,Patrick,79," Oh. No.
",4
9098,SpongeBob,79," Word on the street is that you know where to get quality jellyfishing supplies.
",4
9099,Patrick,79," What street said that? Was it this one? [points at the street] Mind your own business!
",4
9100,SpongeBob,79," Mr. Star, I know that you are in possession of a rare jellyfishing net. I will pay one billion dollars for that net. [shows a fake $1,000,000,000 bill that is colored on with crayon]
",4
9101,Patrick,79," I don't know who you are, but I'm not giving you this jellyfishing net. [holds the jellyfishing case out] I wouldn't sell it for a million dollars, not for a hundred dollars, I wouldn't even sell it for a dollar.
",4
9102,SpongeBob,79," Oh really?
",4
9103,Patrick,79," You can't have it for any price.
",4
9104,SpongeBob,79," And why not?
",4
9105,Patrick,79," This means more to me than money. It's my friend SpongeBob's.
",4
9106,SpongeBob,79," [rips off the mustache] A-ha!
",4
9107,Patrick,79," SpongeBob! Oh, thank goodness you're here. There was this scary guy with a mustache asking a lot of weird questions.
",4
9108,SpongeBob,79," Patrick, I'm the scary mustache guy!
",4
9109,Patrick,79," [screams] Why, SpongeBob, why? Why would you wear such a scary mustache?
",4
9110,SpongeBob,79," Why would you steal my jellyfishing net?
",4
9111,Patrick,79," What?! I'm your best friend!
",4
9112,SpongeBob,79," You were my best friend, you no-good jellyfish net thief!
",4
9113,Patrick,79," How could you think that?
",4
9114,SpongeBob,79," Because you said it. You said that it was your friend SpongeBob's!
",4
9115,Patrick,79," Gift.
",4
9116,SpongeBob,79," What?
",4
9117,Patrick,79," It's my friend SpongeBob's gift. [opens the case up to reveal a new jellyfishing net] I made you a new net.
",4
9118,SpongeBob,79," [reads inscription] For SpongeBob. You made me a new jellyfishing net? That is so thoughtful of you. Patrick? [a bunch of stuff is on the ground]
",4
9119,SpongeBob,79," What'cha doing, best friend?
",4
9120,Patrick,79," I'm not your best friend. I'm just a no-good jelly netting thief fish!
",4
9121,SpongeBob,79," Where are you going?
",4
9122,Patrick,79," I'm leaving Bikini Bottom while I still have my dignity.
",4
9123,SpongeBob,79," Patrick, no! [bus stops in front of them] So, this is it?
",4
9124,Patrick,79," Barring the unforeseen hand of fate, I'm afraid it is.
",4
9125,SpongeBob,79," [hands onto Patrick's left foot] Patrick, don't go. I'm sorry I accused you. It's bad enough I lost my net. I don't want to lose my friend, too. Please forgive me.
",4
9126,Nathaniel,79," What's the holdup? Oh, it's you two. [shows SpongeBob his net] Look, you left your net on the bus again.
",4
9127,SpongeBob,79," Ol' Reliable? I left you on the bus?
",4
9128,Nathaniel,79," You do it every week. Now can we get going?
",4
9129,SpongeBob,79," Patrick, I want you to take this to remember me by.
",4
9130,Patrick,79," You're giving me Ol' Reliable? [cries loudly] I accept your apology!
",4
9131,SpongeBob,79," Oh, come here, you big lug! [both hug and cry loudly]
",4
9132,All,79," Aww...
",4
9133,Nathaniel,79," They do this all the time. I'm serious. I--ugh, never mind.
",4
9134,Patrick,79," I'm staying in Bikini Bottom!
",4
9135,Passengers,79," Hooray! [bus drives off]
",4
9136,Patrick,79," You want to go jellyfishing? I just got a new net. [holds up Ol' Reliable]
",4
9137,SpongeBob,79," So did I. [holds up the one Patrick made for him] My best friend made it for me.
",4
9138,SpongeBob & Patrick,79," Whee! [both laugh and run into Jellyfish Fields, where the exotic jellyfish are still there]",4

",4
9194,Usher Puppet,80," Ticket, please. [Later, SpongeBob, wearing a ski mask, is climbing up the side of the building and through the vent on the roof. He uses a flamethrower to cut his way through a door, which is actually the entry doors. The usher kicks him away from the building. Cut to later, where Mrs. Puff drives up in her boat and gets out, walking up to the usher]
",4
9195,Usher,80," Ticket, ma'am.

9196,Mrs. Puff,80," Certainly. [reaches into her purse. She hears some giggling and takes out what it is] SpongeBob?

",4
9198,SpongeBob,80," [gasps] A reserved seat? Next to my friends? I made it! All I have to do is sit down... [everyone applauds as the curtains close, and SpongeBob completely loses it. yells in frustration as everyone looks at him in confusion] NO! (jumps on stage and tears the curtain) No! It is not over!
",4
9199,Fish,80," Huh?
",4
9200,SpongeBob,80," This was supposed to be my perfect day. But then everything... [a fish gets up and starts to leave. screams] SIT DOWN! [the fish does] Then everything turned to doo-doo. [Mr. Krabs, Patrick and Sandy go upstage with him]
",4
9201,Mr. Krabs,80," It's okay, SpongeBob.
",4
9202,Mr. Krabs,80," Boy, you saved me barnacle the way you put the run on them nematodes.
",4
9203,SpongeBob,80," [sniffles] Yeah, I guess so. But then I was going to do karate with Sandy.
",4
9204,Sandy,80," I know, but you saved the treedome! Pretty cool, if you ask me.
",4
9205,SpongeBob,80," Well, I suppose. But then I was going to go jellyfishing with Patrick.
",4
9206,Patrick,80," But then you... Uh, what'd you do again?
",4
9207,Squidward,80," And, I hate to admit it, but I suppose if you hadn't fixed my reed, the concert would have been a bust.
",4
9208,Mr. Krabs,80," You see, SpongeBob, it's not about you or your perfect day or any of those things.
",4
9209,SpongeBob,80," [starting to feel calm] It's not?
",4
9210,Mr. Krabs,80," No. [chuckles] It's about us!

",5
9239,Patchy,81," Hey,kids! Potty and I took jobs as fry cooks so we could be just like our hero SpongeBob SquarePants!
",5
9240,Potty,81," I took the job for the free sodas.
",5
9241,Patchy,81," Potty, don't you have some dishes to wash?
",5
9242,Mr. Pirateson,81," Arrrrrrrrrgh!
",5
9243,Patchy,81," Hey, kids! Say hello to my boss, Mr. Pirateson.
",5
9244,Mr. Pirateson,81," Arrrrrrrrrgh! [gives Patchy a piece of paper]

9245,Patchy,81," [Reads] One order of scurvy fries, one large bilge water.

9246,Mr. Pirateson,81," Arrrrrrrrrgh! Arrrrrrrrrrgh!

9247,Patchy,81," Oh, I'm sorry. Diet bilge water. Better get on it sir. [Hits himself with his own hook] Owwwwwww!
",5
9248,Potty,81," P.U.! What are you cooking?
",5
9249,Patchy,81," Oh, Potty, you're just in time to see me new pirate patties. I call this one ""Buried Treasure"". [reveals a treasure chest on a hamburger]
",5
9250,Potty,81," Where'd you dig that one up?
",5
9251,Patchy,81," I call this one ""Walk the Plank"". [reveals a wooden board on a hamburger]
",5
9252,Potty,81," I'm already ""board"" with that one.
",5
9253,Patchy,81," This'll blow out your old bird brain of yours. Behold! The Patchy Patty! [reveals a patty on a burger with a face made out of ketchup and mustard on it]
",5
9254,Patchy Patty,81," Ahoy!
",5
9255,Potty,81," Aw, that's the worst one yet.
",5
9256,Patchy,81," Potty the Parrot, you are never supported of me! I don't wanna be your friend anymore! I never wanna see you again!
",5
9257,Potty,81," Brawk, Patchy, no! [Patchy cries and runs to another room] Boo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Brawk! Brawk!
",5
9258,Patchy,81," You know kids this isn't the first time a perfect patty's come between two good friends.
",5
9259,Patchy,81," It happened once in Bikini Bottom.
",5
9260,Patchy,81," Here, take a look while I pull myself together. [continues crying. Episode starts]
",5
9261,Mr. Krabs,81," Hmmm, something ain't right. [a birthday cake on a cart rolls in. The icing reads ""Happy Birthday Krabs""] For me?
",5
9262,Squidward,81," Don't you find this a tad suspicious?
",5
9263,Mr. Krabs,81," Suspicion doesn't hold a candle to birthday wishing. [about to blow out the candle when Plankton pops out from underneath the candle]
",5
9264,Plankton,81," Surprise! [takes out the candle and releases the balloons. The balloons pop and confetti goes everywhere. The light from the popping blinds the customers. Plankton's cart engages in its jet pack and launches itself into the kitchen. Plankton releases the bottom part of the cake onto the safe in the kitchen. The cake explodes and Plankton takes the formula and flies out of the kitchen]
",5
9265,Mr. Krabs,81," Me secret formula!
",5
9266,Plankton,81," Happy Birthday Krabs!
",5
9267,SpongeBob,81," Don't forget your condiments, Plankton. [squirts Plankton with ketchup & mustard]
",5
9268,Mr. Krabs,81," Attaboy, SpongeBob! [turns the ceiling fan on. Plankton's machine bounces off of it and breaks on the floor. SpongeBob snatches the secret formula with his tongue and swallows it]
",5
9269,SpongeBob,81," Safe.
",5
9270,Plankton,81," You'll rue the day we were born, Krabs. I'll be back. [activates his jet pack but he realizes its upside down so he flies into the floor] Oh, barnacles. [everyone is groaning and moaning]
",5
9271,SpongeBob,81," Why, Mr Krabs? Why does he hate us so? [cries]
",5
9272,Mr. Krabs,81," You might as well blame me, SpongeBob. [sits on a barrel seat] There was a time when Plankton and I were best friends. [everyone gasps and runs up to hear the story]
",5
9273,SpongeBob,81," Best friends?
",5
9274,Mr. Krabs,81," Friends at birth, you might say. Even as wee ones. [flashback to Krabs and Plankton as babies]
",5
9275,Plankton,81," Goo! [Krabs laughs then puts Plankton on his crib mobile]
",5
9276,Everyone,81," Aw!
",5
9277,Mr. Krabs,81," Things were all peaches and creams. [Plankton blows out the candles then jumps in the cake. Bubble transition to elementary school] Until we hit grade school.
",5
9278,Kid Mr. Krabs,81," Hey, Planky, whatcha doing?
",5
9279,Kid Plankton,81," Oh, just a little something I thought I'd try out. [a spitball hits Plankton in the back of his head. Classmates laugh] Idiots! I'll show you with science! This concoction is going to blow everyone away. [muffled explosion. Plankton's container blew up all over his table. Classmates laugh]
",5
9280,Classmate,81," How's this for a science experiment, Mr. Brainatron 5000? [uses Plankton as a spitball and launches him to splat in Krabs' eye]
",5
9281,Kid Plankton,81," They'll pay for this one day Eugene!
",5
9282,Mr. Krabs,81," Darn tootin'. Hey, barnacle brains, I think you owe Plankton an apology.
",5
9283,Classmate,81," You're right, Plankton, I'm sorry. Sorry you have to hang out with rag boy. [class laughs]
",5
9284,Classmate #2,81," Yeah. Where'd you do your clothes shopping? The trash can?
",5
9285,Mr. Krabs,81," 'Twas true. I did get me clothes from the trash. [flashback ends] You see, when I was growing up, times were tough. Me mother had to [sniff] fashion me clothes from rags.
",5
9286,Mama Krabs,81," There you go, son. Your outfit's all finished. It's a good thing Old Man Jenkins was kind enough to spare his last washcloth.
",5
9287,Old Man Jenkins,81," Oops. [rips off Mr. Krabs' clothes and uses it as a rag to dry his boat] I missed a spot.
",5
9288,Mr. Krabs,81," Then one day, as Plankton and I were plotting our revenge, I met the love of me life.
",5
9289,Kid Mr. Krabs,81," What in Neptune's name is that? [picks up a penny off the ground] It's the most beautiful thing me eyes have ever seen! What is it?!
",5
9290,Kid Plankton,81," It's money.
",5
9291,Mr. Krabs,81," Money?
",5
9292,Plankton,81," Yeah. You can buy things with it.
",5
9293,Mr. Krabs,81," Buy things? So, I spent it on a gift for me best pal Plankton. [Mr Krabs buys a balloon for Plankton but when he gives it to Plankton, Plankton flies up into the sky because of his weight]
",5
9294,All,81," Wow!
",5
9295,SpongeBob,81," Got your secret recipe, Mr. Krabs. You have no idea that went through to get here.
",5
9296,Mr. Krabs,81," I've got a pretty good idea, yeah. [shoves it away with a pencil]
",5
9297,SWAT Fish #4,81," So, if you guys were such great friends, what happened?
",5
9298,SpongeBob,81," Yeah, Mr. Krabs. What did happen next?
",5
9299,Squidward,81," Yeah. I really wanna know.
",5
9300,Mr. Krabs,81," Listen up, Squidward! Because this is where it gets juicy. It all started in a place called ""Stinky Burgers"". It was the only place to get a burger. Kids loved Stinky's. [all the kids are clamoring] And Stinky loved the kids.
",5
9301,Stinky,81," Now, what can I do for you young 'uns?
",5
9302,Classmate,81," Uh, Mr. Stinky? I'll have one Stinky Burger, please!
",5
9303,Fish #2,81," Me, too, Stinky!
",5
9304,Stinky,81," Oh, now, now, kids. There's plenty of burgers for everyone. [all the kids cheer]
",5
9305,Fish #3,81," That's why we like you so much, Stinky. You always deliver the goods.
",5
9306,Fish #4,81," We don't like Stinky, we respect him.
",5
9307,Stinky,81," Well, which one is it, kids? Do you like me or respect me?
",5
9308,Fish #3,81," Like!
",5
9309,Fish #4,81," Respect!
",5
9310,Fish #3,81," Like!
",5
9311,Fish #4,81," Respect!
",5
9312,Stinky,81," Ok, let's just meet in the middle and say you li-spect me. [all the kids cheer]
",5
9313,Mr. Krabs,81," Excuse us!
",5
9314,Plankton,81," Valuable customers coming through.
",5
9315,Fish #3,81," What are those dorks doing here?
",5
9316,Mr. Krabs,81," Two Stinky Burgers, please.
",5
9317,Stinky,81," [Stinky makes weird faces] Did your brains dribble out all over the sidewalk you slept on last night? If it's burgers you want, go around back.
",5
9318,All,81," Yeah, Stinky!
",5
9319,Classmate,81," Thanks for keeping the nerds out.
",5
9320,Classmate #2,81," You're the best, Stinky.
",5
9321,Stinky,81," Ok, that's enough, kids. Gather around, children. There's something I want to tell you. What I have to say is very important. If you remember one thing for the rest of your life, remember that without your kind patronage, I'd be a penniless loser like Rag Boy. [Mr. Krabs is knocking on the door in the back of the building. Stinky opens up the door, he makes weird faces again] Do you two have kelp for brains? Don't you understand? If you two yahoos come around, you'll drive away all the normal customers. I've worked too long and too hard to make this a li-spectable business. As it is, I can barely afford the essential things in li... [his watch beeps] Is it quitting time already? [rips off his clothes to reveal some nicer clothes underneath] Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to enjoy some of life's essentials. [gets in his limo and moves the stack of cash over on the seat. As he closes the door and drives off, a dollar flies into Mr. Krabs' hand]
",5
9322,Plankton,81," Did you hear that, Krabs? By flipper burgers for those cretins, he was able to gain their li-spect.
",5
9323,Mr. Krabs,81," Did you see that fat stack of loot? I bet if we made a better burger, we'd make a fatter stack of loot. [cash register dings as Mr. Krabs' eyes turn into dollar bill signs] But who has the ability to make such a burger? Who has the skill?
",5
9324,Plankton,81," Skill, schmill, Krabs, baby. Who needs skill when science is on your side? We'll make that burger, and when we do, we will rule the school! [laughs. Patchy reappears]
",5
9325,Patchy,81," I miss Potty. I remember the first time we met. [Patchy shows a picture of him as a young pirate and holding Potty's egg in his hands] If I could only hear his voice.
",5
9326,Potty,81," Less talking and more working.
",5
9327,Patchy,81," [gasps] Potty! You came back to apologize!
",5
9328,Potty,81," I came to tell you to get back to work!
",5
9329,Patchy,81," Hey, you can't tell me what to do you... Huh? Assistant manager? How did you become assistant manager?
",5
9330,Potty,81," Oh a thing called the G.E.D., man.
",5
9331,Patchy,81," Oh, here we go again with the fancy booklearnin'. Customers love me cookin. Why, we're almost out of doggie bags.
",5
9332,Patchy,81," Oh Potty, what am I doing wrong?
",5
9333,Potty,81," You just need some practice, that's all.
",5
9334,Patchy,81," Ahh, me patty's done.
",5
9335,Potty,81," Smells like an unswabbed poop deck!
",5
9336,Patchy,81," Oh, Fine. I'll eat it! [Patchy eats it and then smiles, frowns and spits it out] Oh, for the crime of foaling me taste buds, I order you to walk the plank! [Patchy watches as the burger on a string jumps of the plank into the trash] Ah. Oh well, I bet SpongeBob's first patty didn't go so well either.
",5
9337,Potty,81," Brawk, roll film. [SpongeBob is shown as a baby and he makes a Krabby Patty perfectly] A perfect patty on the first try.
",5
9338,Patchy,81," Oooooh, I'll make a Potty Patty out of you!
",5
9339,Potty,81," You're unsanitary, Patchy, You keep raw hamburger meat in an old boot!
",5
9340,Patchy,81," Well, that's what gives it its special flavor. [Patchy puts a small piece of hamburger meat on top and sparkles]
",5
9341,Potty,81," You've got rats in the kitchen!
",5
9342,Patchy,81," Oh, I brush and shampoo them daily. Who's Patchy's little princess? [Rat bites him] Owwwwwwwww! Mmmmmm! Don't do that!
",5
9343,Potty,81," And you should wash your hands after using the bathroom.
",5
9344,Patchy,81," What? Everytime?
",5
9345,Potty,81," That's not all! This is a step in the right direction.
",5
9346,Patchy,81," What kind of a pirate wears a hairnet?
",5
9347,Potty,81," The same kind who wears a ""Kiss the Cook"" apron.
",5
9348,Patchy,81," Well, you'll never know, Potty. I might get lucky. You hear that, ladies? Patchy's available. Huh? [Patchy winks four times]
",5
9349,Potty,81," Now I feel sick.
",5
9350,Patchy,81," That's it, you feathered snake! This time you gone too far!
",5
9351,Potty,81," Brawk, you missed! Squawk! Is that all you got?
",5
9352,Potty,81," Now you've done it.
",5
9353,Mr. Pirateson,81," [He removes the patty from his face] Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh!
",5
9354,Patchy,81," Yes, Mr. Pirateson. [Potty flies into his office] You kids watch the rest of the cartoon, while I watch Potty get fired.
",5
9355,Mr. Pirateson,81," Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh!
",5
9356,Patchy,81," Coming, Mr. Pirateson, sir.
",5
9357,Mr. Krabs,81," So we went back to our secret hideaway, the dump, to prove to those chowder heads that a burger could be semi-edible and easy to swallow. We made sure to keep careful record of our progress. [Mr. Krabs and Plankton work together to make a burger and go through the steps of doing so]
",5
9358,Plankton,81," Gently. Gently. [holds up the burger on a platter]
",5
9359,Mr. Krabs,81," We finally emerged the best-looking burger under the sea. We went back to Stinky's to rub our patty in those kid's greasy faces. But Stinky's had been shut down by order of the Health Department. So we seized the opportunity and converted our hideout into a restaurant. [Mr. Krabs and Plankton turned a trailer in the dump into a restaurant. Mr. Krabs cut the 'grand opening' tape while Plankton pushed a button to signal for customers. A line of customers line up in front of the restaurant] Our adventure into capitalism began. One dollar, please. [the kid gives his dollar for a burger]
",5
9360,Plankton,81," There you are, sir.
",5
9361,Mr. Krabs,81," T'was me first dollar I ever earned, and was also the start of a beautiful, romantic relationship with money.
",5
9362,Fish #5,81," Hey! Your burger's even worse than Stinky's. We can barely keep them down. And if it weren't for Stinky's shutting down, no one would eat here. So give me a burger. I'm starving.
",5
9363,Plankton,81," Just look at them, Eugene. The very people who ridiculed me are now feasting on my recipe.
",5
9364,Mr. Krabs,81," I thought it was our recipe.
",5
9365,Plankton,81," I'm ruling their stomachs. And soon I'll be ruling their minds! [laughs]
",5
9366,Mr. Krabs,81," But what about satisfying the customer?
",5
9367,Plankton,81," Barnacles to the customer, I'm talking about ruling the world! [laughs again] And with this secret recipe, nothing will stop me!
",5
9368,Mr. Krabs,81," Give me that!
",5
9369,Plankton,81," Stop! You're gonna bust it! [the recipe tears in half]
",5
9370,Mr. Krabs,81," Burgers aren't for ruling worlds!
",5
9371,Plankton,81," I'm terribly sorry, Eugene, I couldn't hear you. Could you come closer? Maybe stand on the tile in front of you?
",5
9372,Mr. Krabs,81," Which one? The one that says ""Eject"" or the one that says ""Trap Door""?
",5
9373,Plankton,81," Oh, either one will do.
",5
9374,Mr. Krabs,81," What I was saying was... [Plankton pulls a string that launches Mr. Krabs out of the restaurant] You'll regret this one day! [Mr. Krabs lands in the trash. Flashback to present] And he always did.
",5
9375,Plankton,81," [pops out of the pepper shaker] Lies! [SpongeBob is about to swallow the formula again but Mr Krabs takes it and puts it in his back pocket]
",5
9376,Mr. Krabs,81," Hold on there, me boy. We don't need to go through that again.
",5
9377,Plankton,81," Very touching, but completely false.
",5
9378,Mr. Krabs,81," Don't know what you mean.
",5
9379,Plankton,81," Why don't you tell them the truth?
",5
9380,SpongeBob,81," It did happen that way, didn't it, Mr. Krabs?
",5
9381,Plankton,81," Most of it's true, except for what really happened! We had created the tastiest burger. That's when things became unsavory. [flashback again to restaurant. Mr. Krabs laughs]
",5
9382,Mr. Krabs,81," First, I'll rule their stomachs and then... [laughs] ...their money! [Mr. Krabs laughs]
",5
9383,Plankton,81," But what about satisfying the customers?
",5
9384,Mr. Krabs,81," Barnacles to the customers! [Plankton gasps] I'm talkin' about coins, cash, wallets, bank accounts! And with this secret recipe, nothing will stop me!
",5
9385,Plankton,81," Gimme that! [both try to take the formula]
",5
9386,Mr. Krabs,81," Stop, you're gonna bust it. [formula tears in half]
",5
9387,Plankton,81," This isn't about money, Eugene.
",5
9388,Mr. Krabs,81," Malarkey. [Mr. Krabs puts Plankton in a straw and spits him out]
",5
9389,Plankton,81," You'll regret this one day! [lands in a pile of trash] Ouch. [emerges and looks at the half of his recipe] Our little squabble only got me part of the recipe.
",5
9390,SpongeBob,81," Gosh, Mr. Plankton, that doesn't sound like the Mr. Krabs story at all.
",5
9391,Karen,81," That's because it isn't.
",5
9392,"SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, & Plankton",81," Karen?!
",5
9393,Karen,81," You're both liars. That's not how it happened at all. In those days, I was just starting out as a security system. Plankton and I met when he installed me.
",5
9394,Plankton,81," It was only our third date.
",5
9395,Karen,81," Anyways, I had recorded the whole thing in my databanks. [flashback on Karen's computer screen]
",5
9396,Plankton,81," Now that's a handsome looking burger.
",5
9397,Mr. Krabs,81," You said it, old chum. [over intercom] Attention! Get your Plankton and Krabs patties right here! [a tumbleweed rolls by] Do you think it was a good idea to open in the dump? [music is playing in the background]
",5
9398,Plankton,81," What's that music?
",5
9399,Mr. Krabs,81," I'd know that theme song anywhere. It's Old Man Jenkins. Old Man Jenkins! [Old Man Jenkins puts a tire in his boat]
",5
9400,Old Man Jenkins,81," I just been looking for some new shoes for Ol' Bessie.
",5
9401,Mr. Krabs,81," You've help me mom and me through some tough times. It would be an honor if you'd be the first to try our delicious burgers.
",5
9402,Old Man Jenkins,81," Why, I'd be happy to! [bites into the burger then smiles]
",5
9403,Mr. Krabs & Plankton,81," Yeah! [Old Man Jenkins falls over. Later, a newspaper appears on screen]
",5
9404,Mr. Krabs,81," ""Plab Patties KO's Old Man J"". I can't believe we poisoned that sweet old guy.
",5
9405,Plankton,81," Well, he is old.
",5
9406,Mr. Krabs,81," Hey. that guy is like family to me.
",5
9407,Plankton,81," Well, it was your fault the patty was tainted.
",5
9408,Mr. Krabs,81," You're the one who put too much seaweed sauce in the burger.
",5
9409,Plankton,81," You let it sit out too long. That's what did it! I'm taking the recipe and fixing it.
",5
9410,Mr. Krabs,81," No way, that recipe's mine! [both fight over the recipe]
",5
9411,Plankton,81," Stop, you're gonna... [recipe tears in half, sending both into opposite sides of the restaurant. Plankton walks out] You wanna fight over this recipe, I'll give ya a fight you'll never forget! [slams the door causing a shelf, above the boiling patty, to spill the jars into the cauldron]
",5
9412,Mr. Krabs,81," Well, that's ruined. But, no use letting this go to waste. These kids'll eat anything. [licks some of the patty mix] I've done it. I've discovered the perfect patty batter.
",5
9413,Karen,81," Meanwhile, Plankton was back at the elementary school. But this time, he was going it alone. [Plankton puts a Chum Bucket bucket with meat in it while Mr. Krabs wheels in ""Krabby Patties"" and knocks him over]
",5
9414,Mr. Krabs,81," Oh, no you don't! This is my turf.
",5
9415,Plankton,81," I think not, Rag Boy.
",5
9416,Mr. Krabs,81," What? Why I oughta squash you right now. You little...
",5
9417,Plankton,81," Get out of my face! [both growl at each other]
",5
9418,Fish #6,81," Hey, look! Nerd fight.
",5
9419,Bully,81," I bet five bucks on Rag Boy.
",5
9420,Plankton,81," Aha! We'll let the customers decide whose burger is better. Step right up, gents. Get a delicious Chum Burger right here.
",5
9421,Classmate,81," Big Johnny will eat anything. [Big Johnny walks over to Plankton's side]
",5
9422,Plankton,81," Have a Chum Burger, Johnny, sir. [Johnny eats it]
",5
9423,Karen,81," Plankton had pieced together his own creation using memory and science.
",5
9424,Plankton,81," Go on, sir! Tell your buddies what you think! [Big Johnny spits the burger out on both his friends]
",5
9425,Classmate,81," I'm gonna try one of Rag Boy's burgers.
",5
9426,Mr. Krabs,81," Here ya are, sir. You are the first to taste a Krabby Patty. [hands him a patty. He takes a bite and instantly enjoys it]
",5
9427,Classmate,81," Flavor!
",5

9433,Mr. Krabs,81," Woo-hoo! My recipe was, is, and always will be the best.
",5

",5
9438,Plankton,81," My life has been nothing but a long line of disappointments since we became enemies. All these years I've been trying to steal your formula. But I was really just trying to steal back our friendship.
",5
9439,Mr. Krabs,81," Really?
",5
9440,Plankton,81," It's all I ever really wanted. To get back to the way it used to be. You and me against the world! How about a hug, Krabs, old pal?
",5

",5
9442,SpongeBob,81," Doesn't it just warm your heart, Karen?
",5

",5

",5

",5

",5

",5
9481,Mr. Krabs,82," You're doin' well, Jim. Is that limo solid gold?
",5
9482,Jim,82," It sure is. I was on my way to my solid gold mansion next to my solid gold lake, when I thought I'd take a trip down memory lane.
",5
9483,Squidward,82," Good ol' Jim! When you worked here, the place had class.
",5
9484,SpongeBob,82," Yeah. When this place had class... [We see a flashback of Mr. Krabs the same old outfit, except he has a blue sweater like his current blue shirt and a medallion that has a ""$"" on it. He also has sideburns, and is dancing in a Krusty Krab that looks like the same from the outside, but looks like a ballroom from the inside with white floors and pink wallpaper. Squidward comes out from the boat in front of the ordering window, which is brown and has a painted wooden mermaid on the front. He lifts off his Krusty Krab hat to reveal long, blonde hair that goes all the way to his thighs. He walks over to Krabs, who points to the kitchen door. Out comes Jim, holding a ""Jim Patty"", with his name signed on the side in ketchup. The only difference with Jim is that he has curly brown hair and a zit beneath his lip. When Krabs and Squidward see the Jim patty, they clutch each other in amazement, then take baskets and skip around Jim, sprinkling flower petals on him as he holds up the Jim Patty. End flashback, and the whole Krusty Krew is laughing, including SpongeBob. They stop and stare at him until he stops also] Well, we've had some good times, too. Right, Squidward?
",5
9485,Squidward,82," No.
",5
9486,Jim,82," Hey, that's new. ""Employee of the Month"", huh?
",5
9487,SpongeBob,82," That's me!
",5
9488,Mr. Krabs,82," Don't worry, Jim. No one could ever replace you. The original is still underneath.
",5
9489,Mr. Krabs,82," Your ""Best Employee Ever"" award! SpongeBob! Sweep up this mess while Jim and I catch up.
",5
9490,SpongeBob,82," Yes, sir.
",5
9491,Jim,82," After I left The Krusty Krab I worked at some of the finest restaurants around the world. I got so successful, I was able to retire in luxury.
",5
9492,SpongeBob,82," Would you sign my Krabby Patty?
",5
9493,Jim,82," Oh, I... Don't sign what I didn't make.
",5
9494,Mr. Krabs,82," Hey, bigshot! Why don't you step behind the fryer for old time's sake?
",5
9495,Jim,82," You're on, Krabs! But I'll have to charge you!
",5
9496,Mr. Krabs,82," Aye, you always knew how to make me laugh. You just don't find employees like that anymore.
",5
9497,SpongeBob,82," Yeah. Not unless you look RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU!!!
",5
9498,Mr. Krabs,82," [Gasps] You're right, boy. I appreciate you, Squidward!
",5
9499,Squidward,82," Now I feel complete!
",5
9500,Mr. Krabs,82," Now how's about that patty?
",5
9501,Jim,82," Everyone, watch and learn!
",5
9502,Bodyguard #1,82," No one watches Jim.
",5
9503,Jim,82," One patty! The right way.
",5
9504,Mr. Krabs,82," It's a thing of beauty!
",5
9505,SpongeBob,82," What's so great about a Jim Patty anyway? [Takes a bite out of it] Meh, it's OK. [His eyes widen and he is transported to a mystical world, full of stars and patties. He rides on one, but it disappears, and he falls. But suddenly he becomes one and slides on a rainbow down into SpongeBob's mouth at the Krusty Krab] Wow! That was... amazing! [SpongeBob walks up to Jim, who is at a table flirting with girls] Uh, Mr. Jim, sir?
",5
9506,Jim,82," Oh, hey! You... You're the guy... who sweeps up, right?
",5
9507,SpongeBob,82," I'm the new fry cook, sir.
",5
9508,Jim,82," Oh! You made that... stepped-on thing I saw earlier, right?
",5
9509,SpongeBob,82," Do you have any tips you can pass on to a rookie?
",5
9510,Jim,82," Besides don't step on the food?
",5
9511,SpongeBob,82," Please critique my work! I wish to learn at the feet of the master!
",5
9512,Jim,82," Now that's the way to grovel. I'll do it! [Later, we see SpongeBob and Jim in the kitchen, training. SpongeBob hands a completed patty to Jim, and Jim weighs it. SpongeBob is very excited, until he follows Jim into the bathroom and watches him flush the patty down the toilet] The pickle slices were too thick.
",5
9513,Jim,82," Hold it... Hold it... Hold it... Okay.
",5
9514,Jim,82," Now, too much mustard, see?
",5
9515,Martin,82," Oh, man!
",5
9516,SpongeBob,82," Am I a fraud?
",5
9517,Squidward,82," SpongeBob, what are you doing in there?
",5
9518,SpongeBob,82," Crying my eyes out.
",5
9519,Squidward,82," Well, hurry up. I gotta cry, too.
",5
9520,SpongeBob,82," Why, Squidward?
",5
9521,Squidward,82," Because when Jim leaves, I'll be stuck with you again!
",5
9522,SpongeBob,82," Don't worry, Squidward. Jim won't be leaving. He's taking my job. I'm the one who's leaving!
",5
9523,Squidward,82," Really? [Upbeat salsa music starts to play] Yes! Ha, cha-cha! Ha, cha-cha! Ha, cha-cha! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Hee, hee, Ha! Ha!
",5
9524,SpongeBob,82," The Krusty Krab deserves better than my meager skills. I should be professional. I must... resign. [He clicks his spatula like a pen, and starts writing on a roll of toilet paper] ""Dear Mr. Krabs,""...
",5
9525,Mr. Krabs,82," Three cheers for the world's greatest fry cook... SpongeBob!
",5
9526,SpongeBob,82," [Gasps] Me?
",5
9527,Mr. Krabs,82," Come here. Help us cheer for Jim.
",5
9528,All But Mr. Krabs and Squidward,82," Hip, hip, Hooray!
",5
9529,SpongeBob,82," Goodbye, grill. Goodbye, pot. Goodbye, pan. So long, fry fat. Goodbye, grease stain. [Kisses the grease stain and runs into the freezer] Goodbye, frozen patty #1. Goodbye, frozen patty #2.
",5
9530,Narrator,82," 298 frozen patties later...
",5
9531,SpongeBob,82," [Runs out of the freezer] Goodbye, freezer.
",5
9532,Mr. Krabs,82," SpongeBob? [SpongeBob hides in the freezer as Mr. Krabs walks in] SpongeBob? [Smells something in the air] That smells like a resignation letter. [leaves the resignation notice under a patty bun on the grill with a flag on the top saying ""Mr. Krabs"" on it] SpongeBob's resignation? Oh, this is terrible! No one's making patties! And that mean I'm not making money!
",5
9533,Jim,82," Hey, Eugene, where's that little fry cook of yours?
",5
9534,Mr. Krabs,82," He thinks you're taking his job, so he's run off!
",5
9535,Jim,82," Hey, great idea! And you can give me a raise!
",5
9536,SpongeBob,82," Look at them. Mr. Krabs is probably offering Jim my job right now.
",5
9537,Mr. Krabs,82," Well, I better go find him. SpongeBob!
",5
9538,SpongeBob,82," Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I was just leaving. I'm not fit to inhabit the same kitchen as Jim. So it is with a heavy heart that I relinquish my position as fry cook.
",5
9539,Jim,82," What are you thinking, SpongeBob? I'm not taking your job.
",5
9540,SpongeBob,82," But you're the greatest fry cook in the world! The Krusty Krab deserves better than me.
",5
9541,Jim,82," Both those statements are true, SpongeBob, but there's a reason I left the Krusty Krab. It all started on a warm summer evening. Business was slow, so Squidward and I were having one of our famous bull sessions. [Flash back to Jim and Squidward, both with hair, talking at the Krusty Krab] We should open our own restaurant if the jail is bulging now.
",5
9542,Squidward,82," No, thanks. I'm just doing this until my clarinet career takes off.
",5
9543,Jim,82," What if it never does? Don't you wanna have something to fall back on?
",5
9544,Squidward,82," Yeah! Ha! I could lose my beautiful, flowing hair, too, but I'm not buying a wig yet.
",5
9545,Jim,82," Well, while you go wig shopping, I'm gonna go talk to Mr. Krabs. [Walks into Mr. Krabs's office] Hey, Mr. Krabs, you gotta second?
",5
9546,Mr. Krabs,82," Anything for you, Jimmy, me boy. Cop a squat and lay your wreck and tell me what's on your wig, Jim.
",5
9547,Mr. Krabs,82," What now?
",5
9548,Jim,82," You know, lay a patch.
",5
9549,Mr. Krabs,82," 'Scuse me?
",5
9550,Jim,82," Give me a raise, or I'm quitting.
",5
9551,Mr. Krabs,82," A raise? That's not in my ""Hiptionary"". Help me get with it, Jack.
",5
9552,Jim,82," Stop talking like that.
",5
9553,Mr. Krabs,82," These sideburns aren't real.
",5
9554,Jim,82," I need more money in my paycheck at the end of every week, capiche?
",5
9555,Squidward,82," My hair! My beautiful hair! My hair! My hair!
",5
9556,Mr. Krabs,82," Aye, it's still as funny today as it was then. [sighs]
",5
9557,SpongeBob,82," Wow! I never thought about it that way!
",5
9558,Mr. Krabs,82," So, you'll stay?
",5
9559,SpongeBob,82," Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs.
",5
9560,Jim,82," Well, Eugene, looks like you've got yourself another sucker. The kid's a good fry cook, but he'll only be a great fry cook when he finally gets the guts to quit this dump. Good luck, SpongeBob. You're gonna need it.
",5
9561,SpongeBob,82," The Krusty Krab isn't a dump.
",5
9562,Mr. Krabs,82," Oh, she's a dump, alright. But she's my dump.

I'll ask someone who cares. [takes off his underwear,and therefore, is naked, then puts it on a pillow, and draws SpongeBob's face on it] SpongeBob, where's that ringing coming from? [pillow falls over on the alarm to where you can hear a rumble. Patrick's stomach grumbles] Breakfast! [cut to Patrick in front of the pantry] Come to Patrick! [opens up the cabinet and all the cans fall out] Tartar sauce. I'm out of food again. All I have is these lousy cans with pictures of food on them. I wanted real food not pictures!

9628,SpongeBob,84," I can't tell. [they walk again but SpongeBob is shining a light on Plankton from the magnifying glass]
",5
9629,Plankton,84," Whew! Gosh, it's hot. [catches on fire] AAAAAAAAH!
",5
9630,SpongeBob,84," He's getting away! Quick, Patrick, use the jet-packs!
",5
9631,Patrick,84," Can do! [pushes a button and Patrick grabs SpongeBob as they fly toward Plankton. Plankton jumps into a soda drink and puts himself out]
",5
9632,Plankton,84," Whew. Huh? [SpongeBob and Patrick are fly over Plankton, setting him and the cup on fire, while they fly through buildings. The jet-pack detaches itself from Patrick and they both skid on the sidewalk. When they stand up, their faces and bodies are deformed]
",5
9633,SpongeBob,84," Boy, it was lucky the sidewalk broke our fall. But we've lost Plankton!
",5
9634,Patrick,84," To the spy mobile! [both hop into the car]
",5
9635,SpongeBob,84," Hmmm... mines, oil slick, smoke screen, shield...
",5
9636,Patrick,84," Self destruct!! [pushes button and the car explodes. Both laugh. Patrick's pants phone is ringing] There's a call coming through on my Pants-A-Phone.
",5
9637,Mr. Krabs,84," Krabs to Agent SpongeBob. Come in SpongeBob.
",5
9638,Patrick,84," It's for you.
",5
9639,SpongeBob,84," Agent SpongeBob here.
",5
9640,Mr. Krabs,84," You found out what Plankton's up to?
",5
9641,SpongeBob,84," I'm afraid we've lost him, Mr. Krabs.
",5
9642,Mr. Krabs,84," Well, find him, lad. I'm not paying you to goof off with Patrick.
",5
9643,SpongeBob,84," You're not paying me at all, Mr. Krabs.
",5
9644,Mr. Krabs,84," Exactly. So get to work. [hangs up]
",5
9645,Recording,84," If you'd like to make a call, please deposit 25 cents. [SpongeBob gets out a quarter. Cut to the Chum Bucket at night. SpongeBob and Patrick are on the roof]
",5
9646,SpongeBob,84," Ok, Patrick, we're in position. Now how do we get inside?
",5
9647,Patrick,84," I think the front door's open.
",5
9648,SpongeBob,84," Spies don't use the front door, Patrick. We've got to figure out a complicated way to get inside.
",5
9649,Patrick,84," This looks like a job for Patrick Star Laser Pants! [shoots a laser out of his behind and cuts out a square on the roof]
",5
9650,SpongeBob,84," Good work, Patrick! Now it's my turn. [drops down inside, with the rope tied around him. He lowers himself but hits the floor] I thought you were holding the rope -- [Patrick lands on top of him]
",5
9651,Patrick,84," I am. You need to be quiet. We're on a secret mission.
",5
9652,Plankton,84," [turns on the lights] Secret mission, eh? [they both scream and hold each other] Don't you think I know what you're up to? You want to eat at the Chum Bucket without your boss knowing. Karen, we've got a customer! [SpongeBob and Patrick are now seated at a table] I'll let you two look over the menu. [jumps off the table and walks off]
",5
9653,Patrick,84," [nervously] SpongeBob, I have to go.
",5
9654,SpongeBob,84," Can't you go later?
",5
9655,Patrick,84," [groans] My laser pants aren't working right. [shoots a laser at the salt shaker on the other table. It vanishes. Patrick sighs]
",5
9656,Plankton,84," Could I interest you in a raspberry iced tea?
",5
9657,Patrick,84," No, thank you.
",5
9658,Plankton,84," Or perhaps a bran muffin?
",5
9659,Patrick,84," SpongeBob, I have to go now!
",5
9660,Plankton,84," Prune Danish? [sees Patrick's behind wiggle] What the...? [pan out to the Chum Bucket building where Patrick's laser pants makes holes everywhere as they all scream and destroys the Chum Bucket. Later, the floor opens up and a blimp emerges with Plankton controlling it from the inside] Destroy my lab, will ya, Krabs? Well, if it's war you want, it's war you'll get! [flies his blimp over to the Krusty Krab. The inside of the Krusty Krab gets darker]
",5
9661,Mr. Krabs,84," I think I put off my cataract surgery too long.
",5
9662,Squidward,84," No, Mr. Krabs, it's that time of the month.
",5
9663,Mr. Krabs,84," [sees the blimp] Merciful Neptune! [red light flashes] Man your battle stations!
",5
9664,Squidward,84," I'm on it! [runs into the bathroom and flushes a toilet]
",5
9665,Mr. Krabs,84," [raises himself in the crow's nest] Bring it on, Plankton.
",5
9666,Plankton,84," Oh, I will. We'll see if you have any customers left after I pump up the volume. [Loud music starts playing. All the customers cover their ears]
",5
9667,Nat,84," Oh, brother, I hated the real version of this song. [The Krusty Krab customers start to leave]
",5
9668,Mr. Krabs,84," He's driving me customers away! All right, Plankton, you want my customers so badly? [he presses a button, a vacuum comes out and sucks up all the customers] You can have 'em! [he launches the customers through a cannon aimed at the blimp]
",5
9669,Plankton,84," [as customers hit the blimp] Do your worst, Krabs!
",5
9670,Squidward,84," [hits the blimp] I hate my job. [he slides down]
",5
9671,SpongeBob,84," [watching from the top of the blimp] It's up to you and me, buddy!
",5
9672,Patrick,84," Abandon ship! [Patrick screams and jumps off the blimp. He lands in the cannon and is blasted back toward the blimp]
",5
9673,Plankton,84," Pointy-headed projectile on the port side! [Patrick makes a hole in the blimp, causing it to fly around]
",5
9674,Mr. Krabs,84," Ha ha ha! Huh? [gasps as the blimp, now on fire, is falling down to the Krusty Krab] No! [the blimp destroys the Krusty Krab]
",5
9675,Plankton,84," [standing on the Krusty Krab sign with a piece of paper in his hand] I win! I always win! [evil laugh]
",5
9676,SpongeBob,84," Not to rain on your parade or anything, but you always lose.
",5
9677,Plankton,84," No, SpongeBob, I always... [he grabs his head and rips it off, turning into Mr. Krabs]
",5
9678,Mr. Krabs,84," ...win!
",5
9679,SpongeBob,84," [gasps] Mr. Krabs?
",5
9680,Mr. Krabs,84," [jumps off the sign] That's right! [he rips the body of Plankton's disguise off] I stole me own formula!
",5
9681,SpongeBob,84," But if you're Mr. Krabs, then who's... [the other Mr. Krabs rips off his suit to show the Robot Krabs from ""Imitation Krabs""] Mr. Krabs is a robot! [Robot Krabs opens its head up to reveal Plankton]
",5
9682,Plankton,84," No, you idiot.
",5
9683,SpongeBob,84," Plankton?! What the barnacles is going on here?
",5
9684,Mr. Krabs,84," You see, we had a bet. Plankton's been trying for 20 years to steal me formula, and he's never done it!
",5
9685,Plankton,84," I almost had it 37 times, and you know it!
",5
9686,Mr. Krabs,84," [shows his claw at Plankton] Tell it to the claw, sister. Last time he failed, we made a bet. [flashback to Mr. Krabs laughing while Plankton is crying on the ground] You can't beat me, Plankton. I always win!
",5
9687,Plankton,84," [he stops crying] You've got the easy part. I'd like to see you do my job.
",5
9688,Mr. Krabs,84," [he picks Plankton up] Oh, yeah right. If I was you, I could steal me formula on me first try.
",5
9689,Plankton,84," Ha! The usual wager?
",5
9690,Mr. Krabs,84," You're on. [flashback ends] So, through a series of events far too elaborate to go into right now, we flawlessly assumed each other's lives; and I beat Plankton at his own game. [points at the destroyed Chum Bucket] And destroyed his place of business! [laughs] Now pay up.
",5
9691,Plankton,84," Here you go, Eugene. [takes out a dollar] One a-dollar.
",5
9692,Patrick,84," Not so fast! [rips his bodysuit off to reveal Squidward]
",5
9693,SpongeBob,84," Squidward? Then who are you?
",5
9694,Squidward,84," I'm not... [SpongeBob tears off his face, revealing facial muscles] ...wearing a disguise. [he puts his face back on and walks away]
",5
9695,SpongeBob,84," Hmmm, if he's Squidward, then you must be... [fake Squidward rips off his suit to reveal Sandy] ...Sandy?
",5
9696,Sandy,84," Whoops, wrong outfit. [rips off bodysuit to reveal another SpongeBob]
",5
9697,SpongeBob,84," [gasps] You're me! Then I must be... [rips off his suit to reveal Patrick]
",5
9698,Patrick,84," Patrick!
",5
9699,SpongeBob,84," Nah, I'm just kidding. [rips off the SpongeBob suit and reveals another Patrick]
",5
9700,Patrick,84," I really am Patrick. [laughs. Other Patrick rips off his bodysuit to reveal SpongeBob again]
",5
9701,SpongeBob,84," Good one, Patrick! [both laugh] There's just one thing I don't understand.
",5
9702,Mr. Krabs,84,"  What's that, laddie?
",5
9703,SpongeBob,84," That. [points to two Patrick's laughing beside each other. Goes to black, ending the episode.]",5

",5
9762,Squidward,85," Socks and-- [gasps. socks and underwear are in the register instead of money] What the...? SpongeBob, why is your underwear in the cash register?
",5
9763,SpongeBob,85," Well, I had to put them somewhere and my underwear drawer is all filled up with Krabby Patties and the freezer is filled up with my iced snowflake collection. [blocks of snowflakes are in the freezer] So I put the cash from the cash register in the pickle jar.
",5
9764,Squidward,85," What?
",5
9765,Mr. Krabs,85," [laughs] Oh, lighten up, Squidward. 'Tis harmless tomfoolery.

9769,Mr. Krabs,85," SpongeBob, you can't be hanging your delicates in me customer's faces. [Harold sees underwear and stops chewing]
",5
9770,SpongeBob,85," Well, they don't see to mind. [Harold takes down a pair of underwear and uses it as a napkin]
",5
9771,Mr. Krabs,85," Oh! I have a disgusting clientele. Who spend their money freely.
",5
9772,SpongeBob,85," [chuckles] Aye aye, captain.
",5
9773,Mr. Krabs,85," Because I'd hate for a certain living arrangement—meaning yours—to interfere with said money spending. [tries opening his office door but can't] What the barnacles? [opens the door slightly to see all of SpongeBob's stuff in his office] SpongeBob! Why is your bed in me office?
",5
9774,SpongeBob,85," It was getting kind of crowded in the kitchen. [squeezes inside the office] So I moved in here.
",5
9775,Mr. Krabs,85," You can't stay in here. These are my private quarters, boy. The only play I can escape for solitude during the day.
",5
9776,SpongeBob,85," But I'll only be here at night. Please, Mr. Krabs, I won't get in your way. Please!
",5
9777,Mr. Krabs,85," Oh... Okay, but I'll have to raise your rent.
",5
9778,SpongeBob,85," Oh, thank you, Mr... [doorbell rings. SpongeBob gasps] My parents!

",5
9781,Mrs. SquarePants,85," Oh, hello. [Mr. Krabs' eye twitches. In the dining area, Harold and Frankie are slipping on snail trail that Gary is leaving on the floor]
",5
9782,SpongeBob,85," Well, I'll let you two get settled.
",5
9783,Jimmy,85," Is this your snail?
",5
9784,SpongeBob,85," [gasps] Gary! Bad boy! No!
",5
9785,Jimmy,85," Put that thing on a leash.
",5
9786,Mr. Krabs,85," [holding golden clam-shaped soap containers in his hand] Squidward, who put these fancy smelling soaps in the restroom?
",5
9787,Squidward,85," The same person who knitted these napkin holders and embroidered the menu. [shows both items]
",5
9788,Mr. Krabs,85," [gasps] Argh. [walks to his office] That boy's taking the manliness out of me restaurant. Oh, he didn't. Floral print curtains in me office? That's it. That's the last straw! I'm not putting up with this any longer. [rips curtains down to reveal Mrs. SquarePants taking a shower]
",5
9789,Mrs. SquarePants,85," Oh!
",5
9790,Mr. Krabs,85," Oh, oh, I...I'm sorry. I didn't know... [walks backwards into Mr. SquarePants]
",5
9791,Mr. SquarePants,85," [angered] What's going on in here?!
",5
9792,Mr. Krabs,85," No, I... [thrown out of his office. Hears buzzing in the kitchen] What the...?
",5
9793,Patrick,85," [walks out of the kitchen] Thanks, SpongeBob. [points to his lower back, background woman screaming plays] If I could reach it, I'd do it myself. [all the customers run out in disgust]
",5
9794,Mr. Krabs,85," Me customers! [cries] Gone! Gone! Gone! All they wanted... was to give me...their money! [strained cries.. then gets angry ] SPONGEBOB! Pack your bags, boy. You're moving out. [SpongeBob is shaving in the kitchen. Meanwhile, Squidward is about to relax in his lawn chair when a moving truck drives up]
",5
9795,Squidward,85," What the...? SpongeBob, what are you doing here?
",5
9796,SpongeBob,85," Oh, Mr. Krabs kicked me out, so now we're neighbors again. Hey, my drums! [plays the drums frantically. Squidward yells. Cut to next day where Mr. Krabs opens up the Krusty Krab but this time, all of Squidward's stuff is inside]

9835,SpongeBob,86," I guess we're not gonna be riding the Fist O' Pain today.

9836,Nat,86," Hold on a second, there's your tickets in your back pockets. [grabs them both]
",5
9837,SpongeBob,86," Oh, barnacles!. [cut to later when SpongeBob and Patrick are walking around the amusement park] It sure was lucky we found our tickets.
",5
9838,Patrick,86," Yeah, bad luck. I mean good luck, very good luck.
",5
9839,SpongeBob,86," There it is. The line looks awfully long.
",5
9840,Patrick,86," Oh, I know! Let's go on some of the dumb kiddie rides first.
",5
9841,SpongeBob,86," Yeah, and then the Fist O' Pain will seem even cooler. [both run off]
",5
9842,Patrick,86," Phew.
",5
9843,SpongeBob,86," Can you believe some people are afraid to ride roller coasters?
",5
9844,Patrick,86," Yeah, only a real baby would be afraid of a roll... Whoa!
",5
9845,SpongeBob,86," I can't believe it, Patrick. It's Glovey Glove! [a giant glove costume is standing in front of them] Get over there and I'll take your picture with him. [Patrick moves a few steps into the camera so he's not too close to Glovey Glove] Get closer, Patrick.
",5
9846,Patrick,86," Nuh-uh.
",5
9847,SpongeBob,86," Come on, closer. [Patrick moves a little closer] That's it, a little more. Now hold onto his thumb. Give me a big smile. [takes the picture]
",5
9848,Patrick,86," How do I look? [pictures shows Patrick touching Glovey Glove with only a finger] Wow, I look great. [a little kid is laughing on one of the kiddie rides]

9850,SpongeBob,86," [clears throat] I mean, The Mitten.
",5
9851,Patrick,86," That ride's for babies.
",5
9852,SpongeBob,86," Yeah. Let's ride it just to see how baby-fied it is. [both walk over and get into the ride, with the little kid. When they go over a bump, they scream. When the ride is over, they get out and both are shivering The baby hits Patrick and walks away]
",5
9853,Patrick,86," I guess that ride was too much for the little guy. [cut to SpongeBob and Patrick standing in line by the Fiery Fist O' Pain]
",5
9854,SpongeBob,86," Well, the line looks a little bit shorter now. Can you believe that some people are scared of this ride? [both chuckle nervously]
",5
9855,Patrick,86," Yeah, it's perfectly safe. No one gets hurt riding these roller coasters. [an old fish is wheel chaired out of Glove World!]
",5
9856,Old Man Jenkins,86," Oh why, why, why? [SpongeBob and Patrick scream and run off] Why won't you let me on the ride?
",5

",5
9869,Larry,86," I just got off the Fist O' Pain. Man, what a rush. [sniffs his armpit then sighs in relief as a green odor is released from under his arm] You smell that? That's the smell of adrenaline. [SpongeBob and Patrick's eyebrows disintegrate]
",5
9870,SpongeBob,86," Oh, it's, uh... [holding breath] very manly, Larry.
",5
9871,Larry,86," [picks up SpongeBob and smells him] SpongeBob, I'm not smelling any adrenaline on you. You haven't gone on the ride?
",5
9872,SpongeBob,86," Um, I have a confession to make. We haven't gone on the ride because I'm... hungry. I'm very hungry. Hungry, hungry! [runs off]

9873,Larry,86," Come on, Patrick. You and me, pal?
",5
9874,Patrick,86," I'm hungry, too. [runs off]

",5
9890,SpongeBob,86," Ow, quit it! Ow, quit it! Ow, quit it!
",5
9891,Patrick,86," [runs back] SpongeBob, I have to tell you something.
",5
9892,SpongeBob,86," I have to tell you something too, Patrick.
",5
9893,Henry,86," [over speaker] Attention. Glove World! will be closing in five minutes.
",5
9894,SpongeBob and Patrick,86," Five minutes?! [both run over to the ride. An employee comes over and cleans up the ice cream]
",5
9895,Ice Cream,86," What are you looking at? [cut to the ride]
",5
9896,SpongeBob & Patrick,86," ...and explosive diarrhea.
",5
9897,SpongeBob,86," Is that all?

",5
9920,Henry,86," [over speaker] Uh, we're experiencing some technical difficulties.
",5
9921,Employee #3,86," Man, this cheap thing is always breaking down. Hey, sorry guys. Maybe next time. [SpongeBob and Patrick sigh in relief]
",5
9922,SpongeBob,86," Patrick, I have a confession to make. I was really scared about going on this ride.
",5
9923,Patrick,86," Me too.
",5
9924,SpongeBob,86," I didn't know how to tell you because, well, I didn't want to disappoint you.
",5
9925,Patrick,86," I didn't want you to be disappointed in me.
",5
9926,SpongeBob,86," But now we don't have to face our fears. The ride is broken.

9931,SpongeBob,86," Patrick, I don't want to face my fears. I'm afraid of them! [when they get to the top, it stops for a moment] Good-bye, Patrick.
",5
9932,Patrick,86," Good-bye, SpongeBob. [Coaster starts again, dropping and going through a saw, a flaming fist, and a laser. When the coaster drops at a 90 degree angle, SpongeBob and Patrick's skeletons fly through the air while their bodies go down with the coaster. Their skeletons fly into them as they go up, out of the water, but when they sit up, they have the other one's skeleton. The coaster drops into the ground, causing an explosion. When the ride is over, SpongeBob & Patrick are holding each other, shaking]
",5
9933,Henry's wife,86," [over speaker] Please wait until the car has come to a complete stop. And stop crying!

9934,Employee #3,86," It's over. You can get out now.

Doo!♪ Hey, looks like you guys and gals are done. [flips all the patties into the air then uses one of his special helmet gadgets to squirt ketchup and mustard on the patties. When the patties fall, they land on a bun that SpongeBob is holding. He then deals out the lettuce, cheese, and tomatoes as if they were cards to the six patties] In all my years of fry cookery, I have never seen a group of patties. Especially— you. [points to a patty with lettuce for hair, tomatoes for eyes, a pickle for a nose, ketchup for rosy cheeks and mustard for a smile] Such perfection from your little lettuce hair to your rosy ketchup cheeks right down to your mustard smile. May I call you— Patty?

9949,Squidward,87," SpongeBob, I need that order of six.

9950,SpongeBob,87," Here you go, Squidward. One, two, three and four, and uh— five and six. [only gives Squidward five patties] That's it. That's the whole order, Squidward. There isn't a Krabby Patty behind my back or anything. [laughs]
",5
9951,Squidward,87," Uh— yeah.
",5
9952,Squidward,87," SpongeBob, where is that other— oh, there it is. [takes the patty to the table. SpongeBob looks out the kitchen door to see three muscular guys sitting at the table, in which two of them are eating patties while the other one doesn't have one]

9959,Squidward,87," [snickering] What are you going to do with it, take it home? Put a little dress on her? Go out for a romantic walk with it? [continues snickering]

9971,Sandy,87," Well, that makes as much sense as a snake with no slither. Patties are put in the water for eating, SpongeBob. Not for bebopping all over Timbuktu.

",5
10013,Mr. Krabs,87," I think I can explain, boy. There was a time when I was in love too. She was a Krabby Patty that looked a lot like yours does. [rotten tomatoes fall out of the patty] Well, maybe not right now, but you know what I mean. She was a firm, juicy, a warm patty. And attractive- oh, she looked good enough to eat. So— I did. do you hear what I'm saying to you, boy?

10014,SpongeBob,87," Um, not quite, Mr. Krabs.

10015,Mr. Krabs,87," Krabby Patties are meant to be loved and eaten. That's what they're put in the ocean for. And it looks like yours is way past due.

10033,SpongeBob,88," No problem, I was just telling this customer he needed to wait for his favorite table.

10039,Mr. Krabs,88," Don't go goofy on me, boy. Money can't really talk. Only fish can talk.

10142,Customer #1,89," I only said one order.

10144,Customer #1,89," Okay, I'll have two.

10145,Squidward,89," [takes out a ticket for the customers' order] SpongeBob, order up. [all the tickets are stuck in the window, he sighs] Welcome to The Krusty— [all the tickets get shot out and Squidward walks in the kitchen] SpongeBob, what in Neptune's... [sees that SpongeBob's body can't move] SpongeBob? [pushes him back and forth and hat tips over. touches spatula] Well, his spatula's still warm. [pokes his eye] Well, SpongeBob. I must admit this is strange behavior, even for you.
",5
10146,Mr. Krabs,89," [shows up in the kitchen] Ahoy, Squidward. [sees SpongeBob] Good Neptune, SpongeBob. what has gotten into to you, son?
",5
10147,Squidward,89," I think he's in some kind of self-induced trance.
",5
10148,Mr. Krabs,89," No, Squidward. this is worse. he's got the thousand-yard stare. I had it once meself back in me service days. [shakes SpongeBob] What is it, lad? Quick, we're losing money! [SpongeBob's hat falls off and Mr. Krabs picks up what's in it] It's the boy's tiny calendar. And he has circled today's date. [reads the date on the 23rd] ""Important Food Critic visits Krusty Krab.""
",5
10149,Squidward,89," That's what's causing all this? Only a complete moron would worry about what some critic has to say. [both Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob are quivering] I rest my case. [the doors get pushed away and a fish version of Gene Shalit named ""Gene Scallop"" enters and sniffs the air in the restaurant] Hey, in or out, mister. You're lettering out the A.C. [the fish stares at Squidward] Weirdo.
",5
10150,Mr. Krabs,89," Why hello. You're the television food critic Gene Scallop, aren't you? Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Eugene Krabs, owner and proprietor of this fine... [Gene Scallop walks away and up to Squidward]
",5
10151,Squidward,89," Well, do you want to order something or do you just want to block my reading light?
",5
10152,Mr. Krabs,89," Squidward, you just drove away Gene Scallop. Don't you know our lives depend on his review?
",5
10153,Mr. Krabs,89," M— Mr. Scallop, wait, please. Before you go, come on, sit down. Try one of our delicious Krabby Patties. It's absolutely— [spits while trying to say ""free""] Complimentary.

",5
10161,Bob,89," You're welcome, Gene.
",5
10162,Gene Scallop,89," [clears throat and moves his glasses] This week, I reviewed The Krusty Krab restaurant, a local burger joint that's second to none; or should I say second to ""run,"" since this critic wanted to make like a banana and peel out the minute he saw how drab this Krab really was.
",5
10163,Barbara,89," That bad, huh Gene?
",5
10164,Gene Scallop,89," Barbara, once I stuck my beak through that door, my appetite flew South for the winter. I mean, I'm not ""kidding"" when I saw this restaurant smells like the rear-end of a goat. [customers smell the aroma, and a gas noise is heard]
",5
10165,Bob,89," And how was the service, Gene?
",5
10166,Gene Scallop,89," You could find livelier help in a graveyard and I'm not just ""coffin."" [two customers are whispering to each other] The management stunk so bad, I had to get my sweater dry cleaned on the way home... with me in it. [customers start mumbling and walking out]
",5
10167,Mr. Krabs,89," Hey, no, wait! Wait!
",5
10168,Gene Scallop,89," [too close to Barbara and Bob] However, at the end of my visit, I chowed down on a meal that titillated my taste buds and gratified my gullet. That Sponge behind the grill is no square when it comes to cooking. [excited talking as the customers rush to sit down at their tables for some food] If Krabs really wanted to soak up the dough, he'd sponge it up, he'd sponge it out, he'd oversponge it. You can never have too much Sponge. [Mr. Krabs' eyes turn into SpongeBob]
",5
10169,SpongeBob,89," Well, back to work.
",5
10170,Mr. Krabs,89," Ay, ay-ay-ay-ay... That's me boy, SpongeBob. That's me boy. [SpongeBob walks in the kitchen as a dollar sign while register rings keep sounding. Cut to a line of fish lined up at The Krusty Krab]
",5
10171,SpongeBob,89," La, la, la, la, la, la! Wow. [Mr. Krabs is working on putting a new sign called ""The Krusty Sponge""]
",5
10172,Mr. Krabs,89," Okay, a little lower, lower— that's perfect.
",5
10173,SpongeBob,89," Good morning, sir. What's with the new sign?
",5
10174,Mr. Krabs,89," Oh, just making a few cosmetic changes.
",5
10175,SpongeBob,89," Oh. you mean like when Squidward had that mole taken of his—
",5
10176,Mr. Krabs,89," Umm— yeah, a little bit like that. [cut to inside The Krusty Sponge where SpongeBob walks past Squidward, dressed in a SpongeBob costume with a sign behind saying ""As Seen on TV""]
",5
10177,SpongeBob,89," Morning, Squidward. Ooh! Squidward, where did you find those shoes? [Squidward hisses at SpongeBob]
",5
10178,Tyler,89," Look, it's him! [walks up to Squidward] Mr. SquarePants, can I have your autograph?
",5
10179,Squidward,89," No.
",5
10180,Tyler,89," But, why?
",5
10181,Squidward,89," Well, the first reason is, I have no use of my arms. see? [shakes his arms, but accidentally hits Tyler]
",5
10182,Tyler,89," Hey!
",5
10183,Mr. Krabs,89," Hey, what's going on over here?
",5
10184,Tyler,89," He hit me. just because I wanted his autograph.
",5
10185,Mr. Krabs,89," Squidward! I'm sorry, little girl. Of course you can have his autograph— for $5.
",5
10186,Tyler,89," What a rip. [walks away. grumbles madly, goes to table]
",5
10187,Mr. Krabs,89," Look at these, Squidward! [holds up napkins that have SpongeBob's face on them]
",5
10188,Squidward,89," Looks like some horrific shroud.
",5
10189,Mr. Krabs,89," They're our new Krusty Sponge napkins! Extra absorbent.
",5
10190,Squidward,89," You really need to see a doctor.
",5
10191,Mr. Krabs,89," Oh, that reminds me, Squidward. I need you to unpack these boxes. [points to a stack of boxes that say ""KK"" on them]
",5
10192,Squidward,89," What's in them?
",5
10193,Mr. Krabs,89," [takes out two bottles that have SpongeBob's face as a label and red nozzles] Condiments. We got ""Tangy Spongy Sauce"" and ""Mild Bobby Sauce"" for the not-so-daring.
",5
10194,Squidward,89," Oh, clever. [SpongeBob runs up to Mr. Krabs]
",5
10195,SpongeBob,89," Captain! My spatula's missing, sir!
",5
10196,Mr. Krabs,89," I got it right here. Here you go, Squidward. [sticks it into the costume's forehead] You're on grill duty now.
",5
10197,Squidward,89," But that's SpongeBob's job!
",5
10198,Mr. Krabs,89," Don't worry, Squidward. I got something else lined up for him. [cut to SpongeBob as the engineer in the train that is going around The Krusty Krab] Step right up, folks! Take a ride on The Krusty Sponge Fun Train. Tickets are only $1.98. Seatbelts not included. [everyone cheers. cut to the kitchen, where Squidward is looking at the spatula that is on the grill]
",5
10199,Squidward,89," Okay, how am I going to do this now? Umm— [grunts while trying to get the spatula. hits it with one of the costume arms and hits himself in the forehead sending him back into pots and pans] Mommy, is that you? [outside, SpongeBob is tired pedaling the train]
",5
10200,SpongeBob,89," Okay, Mr. Krabs. I really think I should be getting back to the grill, now.
",5
10201,Mr. Krabs,89," Are you kidding, lad? Just look at these paying customers! [uses the megaphone] Who's ready for another lap? [everyone cheers] Keep on truckin' SpongeBob. I've got some important business to see to in me office. [cut to Squidward, still in the SpongeBob costume, entering Mr. Krabs' office]
",5
10202,Squidward,89," Mr. Krabs? Uh, this is a bad time, isn't it? [Mr. Krabs is bathing in his money]
",5
10203,Mr. Krabs,89," No.
",5
10204,Squidward,89," Well, there are some men out back with a delivery and want you to sign.
",5
10205,Mr. Krabs,89," Okay, Tell them I'll be right out.
",5
10206,Squidward,89," Got it. [as he turns around, he hits his head on the top of the door entrance] Ow. [mutters]

10207,Mr. Krabs,89," And let's watch the language, Squidward. [cut to Mr. Krabs signing for the packages]
",5
10208,Joe,89," Just sign here, here and here.
",5
10209,Mr. Krabs,89," My pleasure.
",5
10210,Squidward,89," What the heck is this stuff?
",5
10211,Mr. Krabs,89," I'm glad you asked. We got SpongeBob drinking straws— [shows a green straw with SpongeBob in the middle] coasters— [holds up two coasters with SpongeBob's face on them] bibs— [holds up a bib with SpongeBob's face on it that says ""I soiled myself at The Krusty Sponge""] and me personal favorite, SpongeBob ice cubes! [shows them but melt away] Aww.
",5
10212,Squidward,89," Mr. Krabs, don't you think you might be taking all this a little bit too far?
",5
10213,Mr. Krabs,89," Get back to work, SpongeBob. I'll be in me SpongeBob if you SpongeBob me. [walks away. cut to Squidward flipping a patty and laughing] Whoops! [sets three boxes down on the floor] There you go, Squidward.
",5
10214,Squidward,89," Now what?
",5
10215,Mr. Krabs,89," Oh, you're going to love this. Spongy Patties. [shows a yellow patty with green holes]
",5
10216,Squidward,89," Spongy Patties?
",5
10217,Mr. Krabs,89," Yeah. I want you to start using them instead of the other ones. [tosses one on the grill]
",5
10218,Squidward,89," Where'd you get them?
",5
10219,Mr. Krabs,89," They were just in the boxes of patties we didn't have room for in the freezer. They turned yellow. Got to keep those SpongeBob ice cubes somewhere, you know.
",5
10220,Squidward,89," You mean to tell me you actually expect people to pay $1.98 for a rotten patty?
",5
10221,Mr. Krabs,89," Squidward, you're right! All this instant success must be scrambling my brains! We'll make them $2.98. [shuts the kitchen door. cut to SpongeBob blowing the whistle on the Fun Train but really tired]
",5
10222,SpongeBob,89," All aboard.
",5
10223,Peterson,89," Hey, we didn't pay $3.00 to watch you take a nap.
",5
10224,Sally,89," That's the worst SpongeBob costume I've ever seen. [all the passengers chant] Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride! [SpongeBob sneaks away and takes the statue of himself, where Billy is going to get a picture by a camera by Harold, and puts it in his seat of the Fun Train then squeezes through the doors of The Krusty Krab]
",5
10225,SpongeBob,89," Oh, boy. what a day. What's next? A zombie invasion? [screams after Buddy, Bill, Tina, Sadie, Sandals and Frank with green holes walking around like zombies] Mr. Krabs, open up! We're being attacked by a bunch of zombies that look like me.

10226,Mr. Krabs,89," Uh, go away, please, I'm busy.
",5
10227,SpongeBob,89," Please, you don't understand! They're all splotchy and yellow with distended bellies. [screams as the zombies walk towards him] Open up, open up, open up, open up. [bangs on the door hard enough to where it collapses on the floor]
",5
10228,Mr. Krabs,89," Who? [Mr. Krabs is dressed in a nice shirt with a pile of money in the chair across from him]
",5
10229,SpongeBob,89," Mr. Krabs?
",5
10230,Mr. Krabs,89," SpongeBob— [gasps] Great Neptune's mother's stockings! Zombies— they're here to eat me money. [tries to go back into his office but SpongeBob grabs him]
",5
10231,SpongeBob,89," Wait! They're not zombies, Mr. Krabs. They're your customers— look. [two fish are sitting at the table. One is yellow with green holes and the other one is normal-looking]
",5
10232,Sandals,89," [groans] I ate this yellow Krabby Patty and now I feel sick.
",5
10233,Bailiff,89," Krabby Patty? [takes a bite and spits out then walks up to Mr. Krabs] Man, you've got some serious problems. If you're trying to pass that off as a Krabby Patty—
",5
10234,Mr. Krabs,89," It's a... It's a Spongy Patty. [Bailiff turns yellow with green holes]
",5
10235,SpongeBob,89," Mr. Krabs, what have you done? You poisoned all these people.
",5
10236,Mr. Krabs,89," No! But... I just... just... I can explain, I... [Mr. Krabs looks down at his wrists because they are in handcuffs] What the...?
",5
10237,Bailiff,89," [shows his police badge] Tell it to the judge, Krabs. [cut to the courtroom]
",5
10238,Guard,89," Calling the courtroom to attention in the case ""People of Bikini Bottom vs. Mr. Krabs."" The honorable Judge Horace A. Whopper presiding.
",5
10239,Judge Horace A. Whopper,89," [clears throat] Has the jury reached a verdict? [jury is all yellow with green holes. Gene Scallop stands up and is yellow with green holes, too]
",5
10240,Gene Scallop,89," [along with angry fish, except Tina who is not angry] We have, your honor. We the jury find the defendant, Eugene A. Krabs, guilty of all charges.
",5
10241,Judge Horace A. Whopper,89," Very well. Does the defendant have anything to say before we send him down the river?
",5
10242,Mr. Krabs,89," [sadly] No, your honor.
",5
10243,Judge Horace A. Whopper,89," Very well. [bangs the SpongeBob gavel down. When he does, it laughs]
",5
10244,Mr. Krabs,89," Eh, hang on a second there, judge. That wouldn't happen to be a SpongeBob gavel you're using?
",5
10245,Judge Horace A. Whopper,89," Oh, why, yes. It's my prized possession. I am a huge SpongeBob fan.
",5
10246,Mr. Krabs,89," Permission to approach the bench, your honor! [cut to a patty being flipped on the grill]
",5
10247,SpongeBob,89," Sure is glad to be back behind the grill where I belong, Mr. Krabs.
",5
10248,Mr. Krabs,89," It's good to have you back, boy. Let's see how Squidward's enjoying his new position. [outside, Squidward, still in the SpongeBob costume, is giving the judge a ride on the Fun Train. The judge has a whip in his hand] Take him around as many times as you like.
",5
10249,Judge Horace A. Whopper,89," I just might have to take you up on that. [winks and cracks his whip so Squidward goes faster]
",5
10250,Mr. Krabs,89," [sighs] I love a happy ending.

10257,Patrick,90," There, there, SpongeBob. No need to cry.
",5
10258,SpongeBob,90," [He pops off Patrick's shoulder] Yes, there is, Patrick. Sandy's been gone for two whole days.
",5
10259,Patrick,90," Two whole days?! [tears pour out of his eyes like a hose as he begins to wail]
",5
10260,SpongeBob,90," Oh, why'd she have to go to that science convention in Tejas?!
",5
10261,Patrick,90," Tejas! [Cries]
",5
10262,SpongeBob,90," [sniffles, looks at his watch] She won't be back for one more hour, 26 minutes and 47 seconds.
",5
10263,Patrick,90," Oh, 47 seconds! [SpongeBob and Patrick cry tears in each others faces] I miss Sandy so much. Her tentacles, [waves his arms] the way she plays clarinet, her massive nose. [a nose like Squidward's pops onto his face]
",5
10264,SpongeBob,90," Patrick, that's Squidward. [Patrick's Squidward-like nose disappears] He's not gone, he's right here. [pan over to Squidward planting a flower]
",5
10265,Squidward,90," [He is shown wearing a gardening hat and holding a shovel and holding a flower in one hand and a trowel in the other. He is also digging a hole. He finishes digging the hole and looks at SpongeBob.] No, I'm not. [drops the flower into the ground and walks into his home, slamming the door behind him]
",5
10266,SpongeBob,90," I sure do miss that squirrel. [sniff] Her karate chopping, [karate chops ground] that ten-gallon glass dome over her dome. And who can forget those buck teeth? [his buck teeth come together and sparkle. They return to normal.] After Sandy gets back, we're gonna let her know just how much we miss her.
",5
10267,Patrick,90," Is Sandy the one I call Mom?
",5
10268,SpongeBob,90," No, Patrick, that's your mother. But that does give me an idea. We'll throw Sandy the mother of all welcome home parties! Patrick, to the treedome! [runs off, distorted trumpet fanfare plays]
",5
10269,Patrick,90," Wa-hey! [Patrick runs after SpongeBob.]
",5
10270,SpongeBob,90," Ah. [cake is shown, with two red hearts on the both sides of the of the word ""Home."" SpongeBob sets the icing down. The cake is missing from the tray and SpongeBob gasps. Patrick is next to him eating the cake. His water helmet is sitting on the table. He notices SpongeBob glaring at him, pulls the cake out of his mouth and sets it on the tray. The cake is now in the shape of Texas] Huh? [View of the cake. The two red hearts are at the top of the Texas-shaped cake, above the words ""Welcome Home Sandy!"" written in cursive. The 'y' in 'Sandy' curls down to a waving SpongeBob and Patrick decoration. The two smile, SpongeBob has a ""good job"" type smile and Patrick has a reluctant smile. There is another balloon transition to Patrick and SpongeBob pulling ropes to hang a blue ""WELCOME 'DOME' SANDY"" banner in the branches of the tree. A wooden sign points out from the top of the tree that reads ""WE MISSED YOU!"" Balloons are hung in the tree's branches as well as pink banners.] We've readied this place for Sandy's arrival, which should be about... [He looks at his watch] ...Whoo, right now. [The normal submarine-like bus comes down the road, pulls up to Sandy's house and stops. The door opens and Sandy walks out, carrying a suitcase. Patrick and SpongeBob run out from the treedome and stop in front of Sandy. SpongeBob sings] Welcome home, Sandy, you know that we missed ya.
",5
10271,Nat Peterson,90," [Off-Screen] No! [On-Screen] No one wants to hear you sing!
",5
10272,Sandy,90," Sorry, SpongeBob, he's got a fierce no-singing policy. [bus drives off]
",5
10273,SpongeBob,90," That's quite alright, Miss Cheeks. As long you don't have a fierce no-partying policy. [Sandy giggles. The three go inside the treedome] First, cake, then we'll karate-chop, and then...
",5
10274,Sandy,90," [She notices the decorations the two had put up earlier] Wow, guys. You two, uh... [she scratches her neck. All but her helmet is on] Really know how to, uh.. [scratches her back] Throw a party.
",5
10275,SpongeBob,90," I knew it! You have been itching to see us.
",5
10276,Sandy,90," Well, something's making my skin crawl.
",5
10277,SpongeBob,90," Maybe a slice of cake will take your mind off of your crawling hide. [The scene changes to show the three at the picnic table with cake.] Patrick and I made this cake especially for your return. [SpongeBob passes a slice of the cake to Patrick]
",5
10278,Patrick,90," This is gonna taste so good again.
",5
10279,SpongeBob,90," Dig in, Sandy. [Sandy is scratching her back with a fork] Uh...
",5
10280,Sandy,90," Looks... Tasty, SpongeBob.
",5
10281,SpongeBob,90," [He drops his fork] Are you okay, Sandy?
",5
10282,Sandy,90," I'm fine! My skin just hasn't adjusted to this here underwater air. [Sandy's fur begins to be pulled out with her scratching, it floats onto SpongeBob's plate and slice of cake. He moves the plate away with his fork, looking disgusted. He looks over to Patrick and sees him combing the hair on his cake, formed into a mustache and hairdo]
",5
10283,SpongeBob,90," Uh.. Hey, Sandy. Sandy. [he pokes her back, and holds up a pink box with a red ribbon on it] Surprise! [He sets it on the table] Patrick and I chipped in and got ya' a little somethin' somethin'.
",5
10284,Sandy,90," Aww, guys, you shouldn't have. [she rips the wrapping and lid off of the box, and lifts up a purple sandboard] A new itch board? I mean, a new snowboard? Boy, I sure can't wait to scratch this down chafe mountain.
",5
10285,SpongeBob,90," Don't you mean ride this down Scab Mountain?
",5
10286,Sandy,90," Thank you very rawness, SpongeBob and Pat.
",5
10287,SpongeBob,90," Uh, you're welcome, Sandy. Hey, uh, are you still up for some karate chops?
",5
10288,Sandy,90," [Still scratching her neck] Rashy sore. I mean, sure.
",5
10289,SpongeBob,90," [The scene changes to show SpongeBob and Sandy in there Karate Gear (except for the helmet)] Ya ready? [Sandy scratches her back with her karate gloves on] And how 'bout now? You ready?
",5
10290,Sandy,90," [Sandy gets on the floor and scratches her head like a dog, then gets up and scratches her arm] Creepin' critters, feels like somethin's bitin' me. [She looks at her arm closely, her eyes move back and forth, she spots a flea. The flea is biting Sandy's skin. The flea looks up and screeches] I've got a flea? Well, I ain't gonna take that without a fight. [She karate chops her arm] Hi...yah! [The flea jumps off Sandy's arm and lands on her leg] I'll get ya. [She chops her leg three times and tosses her gloves away. She starts biting her leg. SpongeBob and Patrick stare at her, then look at each other. Sandy scratches her leg and her back with her hands, then turns over to scratch her back. SpongeBob walks over] SpongeBob, my suitcase. Hurry. [SpongeBob brings over a blue suitcase. Sandy opens it] I'm ashamed to say this, SpongeBob, but while I was in Texas, I seem to have picked up a flea. [She digs around for something]
",5
10291,SpongeBob,90," What's a flea?
",5
10292,Sandy,90," A flea is a dastardly little vermin that bites us air breathers. But this here flea collar will send the critter a-runnin'. [Flea jumps off Sandy and lands on SpongeBob's hand. The flea screeches]
",5
10293,SpongeBob,90," [laughs] He tickles! Oh, this isn't so bad! [flea bites him] Ow! [gasps] He bit me! Got any more of those fancy collars, Sandy?
",5
10294,Sandy,90," No, but you can use this one right quick. [She puts the collar on SpongeBob's wrist. The flea jumps off SpongeBob and lands on Patrick's belly]
",5
10295,Patrick,90," Ow! Ah, Ooh, ow, ooh, ah, yah, aah. [Breathes heavily and then laughs] Connect the dots. [pulls out a pencil and draws lines between the bite marks] I drawed a horsey. [we see the ""horse"" he drew for a moment and the flea still bites him] Ouch! Why does this flea keep biting me?
",5
10296,Sandy,90," 'Cause he's hungry. When a flea bites you, it's 'cause he's sucking up your blood for nutrition.
",5
10297,Patrick,90," I've been bit by a vampire flea! [He looks up into the air] No! [kneels and looks down] I'm gonna turn into a vampire now! [lies on the ground and starts pulling out grass] It's already happening! Ah, ah! [growls, blows raspberry, his tongue goes around his mouth, then opens and closes mouth and has a squirrel nose]
",5
10298,Sandy,90," Patrick [Patrick's nose disappears] there ain't no such thing as vampires.
",5
10299,Patrick,90," [scratches side like a dog] Augh! Doesn't matter! [Grabs flea collar off SpongeBob] Oh, this itch is killing me. Yagh! [puts the collar on like a belt. The flea jumps off Patrick screeching and lands back on Sandy. She starts scratching]
",5
10300,Sandy,90," Aah! Gimmie that! [She takes the collar and puts it on her neck] Phew! [The flea jumps back on SpongeBob and goes under his tie]
",5
10301,SpongeBob,90," Nyahh! Oh! Sandy, please, Help me, [Scratches]
",5
10302,Sandy,90," [holds onto the collar] I need this.
",5
10303,SpongeBob,90," I need it more! [takes the collar and wears it like a belt. The flea jumps of of him and onto Patrick.]
",5
10304,Patrick,90," Eee! [He grabs the collar]
",5
10305,Sandy,90," Yah! [The flea jumps and goes in Sandy's nose. The flea passes by both eyes and scratches the inside. Sandy screams and takes the collar. They all fight for it and at one point, Patrick throws SpongeBob aside. Sandy is exhausted from scratching. Then the flea lays eggs. The eggs hatch and two fleas emerge screeching. The three fleas jump off of Sandy's head. The Fleas land on SpongeBob and he spins around on the floor scratching] Enough! I will not take this anymore! [She wraps the collar around SpongeBob, Patrick, and herself] Whatcha gonna do now, punks? [The fleas jump off of them] Looky, it worked. Phew. I'm glad that's over.
",5
10306,SpongeBob,90," Um, is that what over looks like? [He points to an increasing amount of fleas]
",5
10307,Sandy,90," Tarnation! They're multiplyin' like mad! [The flea ""pile"" comes over and eats away the flea collar. Sandy, SpongeBob, and Patrick scream] Run!
",5
10308,SpongeBob & Patrick,90," Okay! [A flea ""cannon"" shoots flea ""cannonballs."" They hit the glass and go back into a pile. The ""cannon"" shoots ""cannonballs"" at the three]
",5
10309,Patrick,90," Wah!
",5
10310,SpongeBob,90," Whoa!
",5
10311,Sandy,90," Hey! [""cannonballs"" hit the glass and the flea pile grows bigger] Y'all got the aim of a cross-eyed armadilla. [the flea pile grows even bigger and makes the shape of an ocean wave. The three scream.] Run again!
",5
10312,SpongeBob & Patrick,90," Okay. [The flea wave hits the three of them. SpongeBob looks at his arms and they swell with flea bites. Sandy and Patrick swell, too]
",5
10313,SpongeBob,90," Aah!
",5
10314,Patrick,90," Mraah!
",5
10315,Sandy,90," Aah!
",5
10316,SpongeBob,90," Uh, thanks for having us, Sandy, but we gotta go.
",5
10317,Patrick,90," Yeah, good to see ya. [They run toward the door, but a flea tornado beats them there. The tornado then chases after them]
",5
10318,SpongeBob & Patrick,90," Raah! [Squidward is seen walking and listening to some music] Help! Help! Help!
",5
10319,Squidward,90," Just ignore them, Squidward, and continue your power walk. Heel, toe, heel, toe, heel, toe, heel, toe.
",5
10320,Sandy,90," Back off! [Sandy is squishing the fleas by stepping on them, but they overpower her and run her over. SpongeBob and Patrick rush over]
",5
10321,SpongeBob,90," Sandy! Oh, no! Are you okay? [Sandy gets up and spits out fleas]
",5
10322,Sandy,90," Them varmints is tough. They're from Texas, phew!
",5
10323,Patrick,90," It's gonna be all right. [picks her up] We will help you. [Fleas come down like planes. SpongeBob and Patrick scream] Okay, you know what? None of this would have happened if you didn't come back with your infestation! All you've brought us is fleas, and trouble and pain and itching and a rash. And pain and fleas and itching and... pain. So... much... pain. So much pain. And as for you. [He looks at SpongeBob] If you hadn't thrown this party, we wouldn't be in this mess.
",5
10324,SpongeBob,90," Wait a minute. You had as much to do with this party as I did.
",5
10325,Patrick,90," You call this a party? I'm beginning to question [He taps on SpongeBob's helmet] our friendship.
",5
10326,SpongeBob,90," Stop smudging my helmet!
",5
10327,Patrick,90," Oh, I've got half a mind, buddy.
",5
10328,Sandy,90," [Gets between the two] Would you two men stop yelling at each other?! [Pushes them to the ground] What does that prove?! If were gonna get out of this, we gotta work together.
",5
10329,Patrick,90," You're right. I have an idea. SpongeBob, you get on Sandy's shoulders. [SpongeBob hops onto Sandy's Sholders] Uh-huh. Good. Now, I'll get on top of you! [Straining to get on top of SpongeBob's shoulders. He sits down] Ah... [Munches on an apple, then burps] Ahhh... Much better. [the ""tower"" topples over] Whoa!
",5
10330,Sandy,90," I do not play games. [The fleas assemble to make an evil face, then laugh maniacally. SpongeBob and Patrick hold each other in fright] Quick! In the tree house. It's the only safe place left. [Shuts the door behind her] We should be protected here. [SpongeBob and Patrick look shocked as the tree house rumbles and shakes and fleas enter through the window] Hold on! [Sandy throws an acorn on a button labeled ""Emergency Escape Hatch."" The floor opens and leads them back outside. Fleas start to take over the treedome, and break the picnic table, and start to cover SpongeBob, Patrick, and Sandy]
",5
10331,SpongeBob,90," Is this how we will spend the rest of our lives? Living in fleas instead of water?
",5
10332,Sandy,90," [Her mind pings with an idea] SpongeBob! That's It. Water! [She puts on her helmet and karate chops her way to the door. She opens it, and water starts to fill the dome. Patrick and SpongeBob start to cry. Their helmets come off]
",5
10333,SpongeBob & Patrick,90," Water! [Fish are being sucked into the dome]
",5
10334,SpongeBob,90," It sure is good to have you back, Sandy! [The episode ends with the ocean empty and all the citizens stuck in Sandy's treedome]",5

10348,Mr. Krabs,91," You think! SpongeBob! [SpongeBob runs onto the scene]

",5
10352,Plankton,91," Never! Never! I'll never get Krabs' formula! Mr. Krabs is too stupid and is too powerful! If only there were a way to render him helpless!
",5
10353,Sadie,91," [with her baby] Oh, look at you, you're so small, tiny and helpless.
",5
10354,Plankton,91," Hey, I resent that!
",5
10355,Sadie,91," [she takes the bottle from her baby] Why, you're so tiny and helpless, I could give you formula whenever I wanted to and you couldn't do a thing about it. [Baby Rechid starts crying, Sadie puts the bottle back into her baby's mouth and moves on]

10356,Plankton,91," Something about that woman reminds me of my mother. That's it! Finally, victory will be mine! I'll turn Eugene Krabs into a powerless…baby.

",5
10358,Plankton,91," [We see some green gas appear around Krabs] I've done it! Nothing can stop me now! My goo goo gas will transform Krabs into a tiny helpless infant! [He opens the phone booth, revealing Mr. Krabs as a baby. The key is right beside him] The key to the Krusty Krab. This is easier than I hoped. [Looks at Krabs] He's a little bigger than I imagined. [Krabs starts biting him] Ow! Ow! Ow! [releases him, but he can't reach for the doors]
",5
10359,SpongeBob,91," Hey, a baby! What are you doing out here alone, baby? I'll take charge of you until your mommy shows up! Oh, you're just too cute.

10361,SpongeBob,91," Oh, sure thing, Plankton. Here you go, little guy.
",5
10362,Plankton,91," Yes, my plan is working perfectly, now that I've turned Krabs into a helpless baby, the Krabby Patty formula will be mine! Hello.
",5
10363,SpongeBob,91," [looking at Plankton after hearing what he just said] Police! Police!
",5
10364,Plankton,91," [getting arrested] Fools, you'll never hold me! Your primitive shackles are no match for my genius. [the cuffs are too wide, and he easily escapes] I'm free! Free!
",5
10365,SpongeBob,91," Oh, Squidward. Thank Neptune you're here. I found this baby all alone. But he wasn't really alone, he was with Plankton! And he's not a baby! It's Mr. Krabs! Plankton turned him into a baby so he could steal the Krabby Patty secret formula! [Baby Krabs burps in Squidward's face] What do we do, Squidward?

How about a stack of 20s? [shows a stack of $20 bills; Krabs takes it]

10383,Plankton,91," That's right, SpongeBob, I'm back! And you won't stop me this time. [Mr. Krabs turns into an adult, and SpongeBob turns into a baby] What? SpongeBob's a baby but Krabs is back to normal [sprays again. Mr. Krabs returns to his baby form as SpongeBob returns to normal, but is still wearing a rectangular diaper and is barefoot] It seems the second dose acts as an antidote! [he is turned back into a baby again] One squirt equals baby, two squirts equals adult! [sprays both of them once, and they come back to normal. They're still wearing their diapers] Or is it three squirts for baby and four squirts for adult. [tries to spray them but nothing comes out] Barnacles, I've run out of gas!
",5
10384,Mr. Krabs,91," Ahem!
",5
10385,Plankton,91," Krabs! Nice diaper. [Mr. Krabs is about to throw him] Come on, come on! [throws him. cut to Plankton flying in the air] I've got it!
",5
10386,Mr. Krabs,91," [checking the mailbox] Better be something other than bills this time. [Plankton comes out] Plankton!
",5
10387,Plankton,91," Peek-a-boo!
",5
10388,Mr. Krabs,91," [running back in the Krusty Krab] I can't tolerate your stinky gas!
",5
10389,Dennis,91," [farts]
",5
10390,Miss Shell,91," That makes two of us.
",5
10391,Dennis,91," I don't do it on purpose!
",5
10392,Mr. Krabs,91," You'll never catch me, Plankton! Never! Ooh…another penny! Come to papa! Now were we doing?
",5
10393,Plankton,91," This! [sprays him] What's the matter, baby? Are you gonna cry? [Mr. Krabs is turned into a senior citizen] What the heck happened to you? This isn't baby gas! It's senior citizen spray!
",5
10394,Mr. Krabs,91," Eh? What was that, Sonny?
",5
10395,Plankton,91," Out of my way, Methuselah! You're old and useless. [SpongeBob comes out of nowhere]
",5
10396,SpongeBob,91," Hold it right there! Old people are out greatest natural resource! I salute you, elder citizenry!
",5
10397,Plankton,91," I'm getting old listening to this. Let's try this again! [sprays the gas on SpongeBob]
",5
10398,SpongeBob,91," I remember when a quarter used to cost a nickel.
",5
10399,Plankton,91," This baby gas is worthless! At least you're way too old to stop me from stealing a Krabby Patty!
",5
10400,SpongeBob,91," What was that, sonny?
",5
10401,Plankton,91," It'll take more time to explain than you have left.
",5
10402,SpongeBob,91," What?
",5
10403,Mr. Krabs,91," He's got the Krabby Patty! Catch him!
",5
10404,SpongeBob,91," Catch who?
",5
10405,Mr. Krabs,91," Oh, Gesundheit.
",5
10406,Plankton,91," Victory is mine! [shaken by the sound of walkers]
",5
10407,SpongeBob,91," Come back here, you little whippersnapper!
",5
10408,Mr. Krabs,91," You kids get off my lawn! I'll catch up with you, boy!
",5
10409,SpongeBob,91," I'm catching up with my knitting.
",5
10410,Mr. Krabs,91," [hatches an idea] That's it! Knit, little nitwit!
",5
10411,Plankton,91," That was almost too easy. [is caught in a net] No! I demand you geezers release me!
",5
10412,Mr. Krabs,91," Right after the party. The piñata party.
",5
10413,Plankton,91," What?
",5
10414,Senior Citizens,91," That's for calling us old. I want candy!
",5
10415,Plankton,91," 1 squirt equals baby, carry over the 2 plus the square root of SpongeBob. Of course! The final ingredient I'm lacking! It's so simple yet so evil! And I know just where to get it.
",5
10416,Plankton,91," Excuse me, what aisle did you get that from?
",5
10417,Shubie,91," You mean the Kelp-O?
",5
10418,Plankton,91," No, that thing! The ugly drippy smelly thing.
",5
10419,Shubie,91," Are you talking about my baby, creep? [Chases Plankton with her cart. She ends up squashing him by running him over.]
",5
10420,Plankton,91," Ow ow ow! [moans] Baby powder? This could be just what I need! Hey buddy, is this made of real or artificial babies? [Shubie squishes Plankton again with her cart.] Ow ow ow ow! [Cut to the Chum Bucket] That powdered baby did the trick! Now my baby gas can't possibly fail!
",5
10421,Karen,91," Just like all your plans that ""couldn't possibly fail?""
",5
10422,Plankton,91," What is it now, Karen?
",5
10423,Karen,91," I'm saying you should test your gas before you come running there all willy nilly!
",5
10424,Plankton,91," That's an excellent idea. And I know just the guinea pig! [Grabs the pack and points it at Karen]
",5
10425,Karen,91," [gasps] Plankton, don't you dare! [sprays her and a calculator falls to the ground]
",5
10426,Plankton,91," Karen! Speak to me! [the calculator types in ""hello"" as 07734 upside down] It worked!
",5
10427,Plankton,91," Everyone say your ABCs! [sprays two people, who start crying] Now when you turn into babies, [sprays more people, who start crying] you stay babies! Hey, Krabs, catch! [Krabs turns into a baby, who starts crying. SpongeBob comes out of the kitchen]
",5
10428,SpongeBob,91," What's wrong, little feller? [He is turned into a baby. They both cry. The other adults cry as they're turned to babies] [Cut to an ceiling scene of the Krusty Krab, where there is a chaos. Cut to the bathroom doors, with a baby next to it. Squidward enters, along with a gas bomb. the doors open and he turns into a baby. He cries also] [Patrick is also turned into a baby]
",5
10429,Plankton,91," My moment of triumph! [slips on some sort of blue stuff] What the...? [Baby SpongeBob, Baby Squidward, and Baby Mr. Krabs are seen slobbering, like all babies do] Oh, gross! I command you to stop drooling on me!
",5
10430,Baby Mr. Krabs,91," Goo!
",5
10431,Plankton,91," [he yelps. Baby Mr. Krabs grabs Plankton.] Put me down! [Baby Mr. Krabs just shakes him playfully as if he were a rattle for babies] Ow! Stop it! I'm an adult! [Baby SpongeBob grabs Plankton, who screams. He burbles. Baby SpongeBob puts him in his mouth and sucks on him, then he spits Plankton as he lands on Patrick's back]
",5
10432,Plankton,91," Yeow! [He slides in Patrick's diaper. Baby Patrick farts as he laughs , and Plankton jumps out, screaming in terror. Baby Mr. Krabs is then seen sucking the Krabby Patty secret formula like a baby bottle] Huh? I don't believe it! Krabby Patty Formula! He's teething on it! [Baby Harold crawls in the background] Give it here, you big stupid baby! [Baby Mr. Krabs squishes Plankton with the bottle] Ow. [he squishes him 4 more times as Baby Thaddeus laughs. As Baby Mr. Krabs crawls away, Plankton emerges, groaning in pain] I've got it! Just like taking candy from a baby! Get it, Krabs? I'm taking candy from you! [Baby SpongeBob starts playing with the gas] Hey! What are you doing? [the gas releases and it sprays Plankton] Uh-oh. [he shrinks until he is no longer seen as he is in another dimension with amoebas floating around him] Ahem! [he covers himself] Mama's evil little genius needs a diaper!",5

10439,Patchy,92," Let's go! [honks his horn] Hey, kids. Rush hour traffic here in Encino is really bad. A little music should calm my jangled nerve. At least my dash-in hi-fi still works. [Patchy puts a cassette tape in the radio, which breaks and the music stops. Patchy shows the broken cassette tape.] Me ultra-rare Frampton Comes Alive 8-track destroyed! [Tosses it into the car] And I'm gonna miss the new SpongeBob cartoon if this traffic doesn't move soon! [Patchy groans and moans. Patchy's cell phone rings. The ringtone is SpongeBob's piccolo from the theme song. Patchy answers the phone] Who's calling? Yes, Patchy here. Start squawking.

10440,Potty,92," [squawks] Hey, Patchy, the new SpongeBob cartoon is about to start. Where are you, brawk?

10441,Patchy,92," Stuck on the 101. Be a dear and record it for me, will you?

[Potty hangs up] Potty?  Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Guah. Dropped again. [Patchy closes his phone] Curse this traffic! [the traffic starts moving again] Oooooh! [Patchy pulls up his anchor. Patchy drives into a desert-like area] Arrrrrrr, home at last. What the...? [his eyes pop out from behind his pair of sunglasses, breaking them] Encino... it's gone. NO...!!! [Patchy cries] You know, kids, this reminds Patchy of an old story. Another story of a lost city. Why don't you go check it out? Oh, Encino. [episode starts. SpongeBob and Patrick are blowing bubbles]

10446,Patrick,92," A beautiful specimen, SpongeBob.
",5
10447,SpongeBob,92," Hurry Patrick, hurry! [Patrick takes a photo of the bubble and it pops] How's it look, buddy? Ready for the old scrapbook?
",5
10448,Patrick,92," More like the scrap-heap. [throws the photo into a big pile] They never come out right! Oh well, let's try again.

10449,SpongeBob,92," OK, Patrick, this one's gonna be a masterpiece.

10454,Patrick,92," It's not?
",5
10455,SpongeBob,92," No, it is the very nature of the fragile bubble.
",5
10456,Patrick,92," It Is?

10468,SpongeBob,92," Huh? [gasps] What have I done!? [The two start crying for help as the bubble drifts into a cave] We're never gonna get out of here!
",5
10469,Patrick,92," No! [the bubble is popped by a jagged point of half a broken amulet] What happened?
",5
10470,SpongeBob,92," [pointing to broken amulet] That's what happened, Patrick.
",5
10471,Patrick,92," Whoa, what is it? It looks really old.
",5
10472,Patrick,92," Antis, Antis...SquarePantis! Probably belonged to your ancient ancestors. [Picks up the half of the amulet] SpongeBob SquarePantis, you must wear the ancient crest of your ancestors for it is your birth right! [shoves it into SpongeBob's face]

Spending your day studying the Atlantean masters. And best of all, no Sponge...

10482,SpongeBob,92," We were just...
",5
10483,Squidward,92," You're going to steal it!?
",5
10484,SpongeBob,92," No. Squidward, we'd never...
",5
10485,Squidward,92," This is a new low, even for YOU TWO. Lucky for you, I was here today. Stealing artifacts could land you in the stony loneso... [Sees the amulet's half was still there and Squidward was dumb founded] ahh! ahh! ahh! ome! You boobs found the missing half to the Atlantean amulet?
",5
10486,SpongeBob,92," Uh, whats an Atlantean omelet?
",5
10487,Squidward,92," Amulet, bot omelet! It's the key to untold riches!
",5
10488,Mr. Krabs,92," Did somebody say untold riches!?
",5
10489,Squidward,92," Yes Eugene. The streets are lined with gold, and the street lamps are made with diamonds.
",5
10490,Mr. Krabs,92," Diamond light bulbs! I wonder what they make the money out of.
",5
10491,Squidward,92," For reasons unknown, this great city disappeared one day, but no ruins were ever found. All the inventions that you take for granted, were given to us by the Atlanteans. Their advances in art, financial wealth and weaponry were eons ahead of their time!
",5
10492,SpongeBob,92," Why is this bubble painted on the murel?
",5
10493,Squidward,92," That's just the oldest living bubble
",5
10494,SpongeBob,92," The oldest living bubble, alive! [shoves Patrick in front of it] Behold Patrick-the oldest living bubble!
",5
10495,Patrick,92," This is the most beautiful bubble I've ever seen.
",5
10496,Squidward,92," That's just a painting you quarter-wit! [to Krabs] Quarter-wit. Ha, it's less than half. The real bubble lives in Atlantis, some darn old bubble hales in comparison to the art...

10497,Mr. Krabs,92," Money!
",5
10498,Sandy,92," [comes onto the screen from out of nowhere] And science, don't forget science. Whats all the hubba boys?
",5
10499,Squidward,92," These two chowder brains found the missing half to the amulet of Atlantis.
",5
10500,Sandy,92," The Amulet of Atlantis?! Legend says, that when the two halves are joined, the path to Atlantis is opened! What are y'all waitin' for? Let's hitch them two dogies up! Go on Squidward!
",5
10501,Mr. Krabs,92," Hurry up Squidward, that money ain't gettin' any younger. [Squidward connects the two halves and a bright light activates. Squidward is happy. Sandy is in disbelief. SpongeBob and Patrick exclaim excitedly.]

10502,Patrick,92," [screams]

10503,SpongeBob,92," Hoo hoo yeah, hoo hoo hoo!
",5
10504,Squidward,92," The magical path to Atlantis is a Van?

10505,Mr. Krabs,92," Nice hot rod flames!
",5
10506,Patrick,92," [Coin spins and attaches itself to the van] What's it doing? [The door to the van opens. We fade to black, then to the van opening again. Sandy looks inside]
",5
10507,Sandy,92," Well, holly-wally ding-dang-doo. Would ya' look at that!? Take a gander, y'all!
",5
10508,Squidward,92," Fabulous decor!
",5
10509,Mr. Krabs,92," Quite a vessel, but who's manning it?
",5
10510,Robot,92," Greetings. Welcome aboard the seaship Atlantis. This is a nonstop trip, so please take a seat, relax, and we'll be on our way.
",5
10511,Mr. Krabs,92," Bet there's some loose change in here!
",5
10512,SpongeBob,92," Ah, so this is what luxury feels like.
",5
10513,Squidward,92," Ah, what I wouldn't give for a foot-rub.
",5
10514,Robot,92," Attention passengers, regretfully we lack the fuel needed for forward motion.
",5
10515,All,92," What!?
",5
10516,Mr. Krabs,92," Is this some kind of joke? Where's the gas tank?
",5
10517,Robot,92," We Atlanteans find the use of fossil fuels to be counter-intuitive, and have developed an alternative source we call song.
",5
10518,Mr. Krabs,92," Huh?
",5
10519,Robot,92," The engine of this vessel is fueled by song, the more you sing of you desires, the closer to Atlantis you will get. Let us commence singing.
",5
10520,Squidward,92," Does that make any sense?
",5
10521,SpongeBob,92," No, but I'm game for singing any day! ♪Sing? Sing a song? A song of wanting to move along!♪ [The van rises up and floats in mid-air. SpongeBob sings off-key] ♪To a land where all our dre-e.♪ [The van rises up and floats in mid-air.

10524,Sandy,92," ♪Did you all hear something? I can hardly believe that there's a lost city where having smarts is more important-than being pretty!♪ [Sandy makes a clone of herself] ♪With all their advanced science, and my painfully large mind!♪

10525,Sandy Clone,92," ♪I bet we can figure out how to make wondrous things, like melons with edible rinds!♪ [they dig in on watermelon. Juice gets on the screen and transitions to Squidward playing piano]

10526,Squidward,92," ♪As a connoisseur of fine art, I'm proud to say! I've always seen things in my own special way! 'Art'-lantis with their glorious aesthetics, I'll cop their style in a while- my art will be prophetic!♪

10528,Robot,92," Warning, you have run out of song fuel.

10529,All,92," [Everyone huddles together and screams until Squidward looks out the window]
",5
10530,Squidward,92," Hey look, it's Atlantis.
",5
10531,SpongeBob,92," Pretty!
",5
10532,All,92," [They continue to scream and the bus smashes through a city wall of Atlantis. We see that it has futuristic blue and purple buildings with spires and bubbles. The bus suddenly skids to a stop, unearthing some trees in the process. The five emerge from the bus.]
",5
10533,Squidward,92," You villains haven't even been here two minutes and you've already messed up someone's topiary garden.
",5
10534,Mr. Krabs,92," Go on, SpongeBob. Ring the bell.
",5
10535,SpongeBob,92," Ring for the king, huh? [rings the bell. A red carpet comes down the stairs and Lord Royal Highness comes out]
",5
10536,Lord Royal Highness,92," Welcome to Atlantis. I've been expecting you. [Falls down the stairs] Allow me to introduce myself. I am the Lord Royal Highness, but my friends call me LRH.
",5
10537,SpongeBob,92," My friends call me SpongeBob. I'm here to see the oldest living bubble.
",5
10538,LRH,92," Yes, of course.
",5
10539,Mr. Krabs,92," What a ripoff! This street ain't gold!
",5
10540,LRH,92," Oh, if it's gold you want, you'll find it in our vault.
",5
10541,Mr. Krabs,92," I'm Eugene. I like money.
",5
10542,LRH,92," Yes, I can see that. Pleasure to meet you. Come, I'll give you the grand tour of our Atlantean fortress. I'm so glad you're all here.
",5
10543,Plankton,92," They're gone. Now to get to those weapons... [tries to open the glovebox door, but fails] Trapped! Ok, what do I have to work with here? What's this? Owners manual!? Looks like I found my escape route! [Laughs diabolically] Owe!
",5
10544,LRH,92," For centuries, we Atlanteans spent, nay, wasted our talents and energy building the most sophisticated weaponry to defend ourselves from invaders. But we abandoned the idea of warfare long ago and now all these weapons gather dust behind this locked door as an example of what must be done if one wishes to live in harmony with all creatures of this, or any, world.
",5
10545,Mr. Krabs,92," [sighs] Eh, harmony shmarmony. When do we get to see the treasure?!
",5
10546,LRH,92," But of course, follow me.
",5
10547,Mr. Krabs,92," Comin' through, boys!
",5
10548,Plankton,92," These Atlanteans leave a room full of the most advanced weaponry unguarded? No wonder they got lost. [Squeezes under door] Oh, my! There will be no one to stop me this time! [Laughs diabolically. Patchy reappears]
",5
10549,Patchy,92," Well, bad news, kids. Encino's still lost. [The radio starts playing] Oh! But, at least I got me radio fixed! [Patchy snaps his fingers while listening to it, then, it explodes] Well, enjoy the rest of the show. [cuts back to Atlantis and then cuts to LRH giving the tour]
",5
10550,LRH,92," It is both an honor and a pleasure to welcome you to Atlantis. We haven't had visitors in some time. You see, being in a lost city has certain disadvantages which I digress. Now if you follow me, I'll show you some of our grandest achievements...
",5
10551,Mr. Krabs,92," Squidward! You told me the streets were paved with gold. Now that street light better be a 600 dollar diamond or else. [Mr. Krabs gets on Squidward's neck and starts unscrewing a lightbulb] Ah hold still, Squidward.
",5
10552,Squidward,92," You're standing on my neck!
",5
10553,LRH,92," Are you all right?
",5
10554,Mr. Krabs,92," Yeah, but I feel odd.
",5
10555,SpongeBob,92," Mr. Krabs?
",5

With mountains of money, and rivers of cash. And a pool of coins to make a splash! Oh, I'll open up a Krusty Krab with patties made of money. They'd be delicious, and expensive, and taste like golden honey! Money and gold and treasure untold! And all of it for me!♪

10572,Sandy,92," Hoppin' acorns. Look at all this high tech gear! [Looks at an invention] What does this gizmo do?
",5
10573,LRH,92," It's a biomass converting device. It can take any household object, this comb for example and turn it into say, ice cream. Would anyone like to try?

10578,Sandy,92," What else can it turn things into?
",5
10579,LRH,92," Actually it can only turn things into ice cream. We haven't worked out that bug yet but I can show you the most amazing/fantastic device created by Atlantean hands. Behold, this grand machine allows the user to shrink down to nano-stature, enabling them to battle germs hand to hand.

10580,Sandy,92," How's it work?

",5
10600,SpongeBob,92," Oh, oh, I know, I know!
",5
10601,Squidward,92," I thought you'd never ask! Art is the conscious arrangement of elements in a manner that affects a sense of beauty.
",5
10602,LRH,92," Not even close! [Squidward looks shocked] Art is what happens when you learn to dream. [Gives SpongeBob a blue paint brush] Go ahead. Dream a little.

From now on please call me Sir Real. I can wait for your impression to congeal. Take it from an undersea renaissance man. I'd even look great on the side of your van! Any way you carve it, I am art and art is me. Ask your mama or your dada to tell you about the uh, schism. Between minimalism and cubism. My personality may be of the cynical type.

",5
10615,LRH,92," Do excuse me. Most folks don't stay with the tour this long. Of course you can. First, remember this. This bubble is over one million years old. It was brought here when the first Atlanteans colonized this place. Deftly hand carried over billions of light years from our home planet. It is our people's most beloved and treasured ancient relic. But most importantly remember to have fun!

10616,SpongeBob,92," There it is Patrick!

10617,Both,92," The World's Oldest Living Bubble!

10620,LRH,92," Now if you'll excuse me, I have to make ready for tonight's dinner. So I'm just going to leave you two friendly strangers alone with our most beloved ancient and fragile Atlantean relic. Join us in the dining hall when you've had an eye-full!

10621,SpongeBob,92," Thank you Mr. Lord Royal Highness sir. [They shove their faces on the glass] Just look at it Patrick. Ah the stories this bubble could tell. I just wish we could get a closer look. [They lean in but the glass moves] Patrick! Get the--

10631,SpongeBob,92," Mmm-Hmm.
",5
10632,LRH,92," So sorry I'm late. The tour ran a little long. So, how are you all enjoying our beloved city?
",5
10633,Squidward,92," I'm never leaving this place. I've learned more about painting in a few hours here than I did in four years of community college.

10634,LRH,92," Absolutely marvelous! And Eugene, I assume the hall of treasure was everything you hoped for? [Mr. Krabs is brain-washed by the money and talks gibberish] And Sandra, how did you find our laboratory?

10637,Sandy,92," I'll show you. [Presses a button and the food goes directly in her stomach] Now I can eat underwater without removing my helmet! This is just the beginning! I should have a cure for the common cold up and running by tomorrow afternoon with your high-tech lab!

10648,SpongeBob,92," It's not a joke, we burst the bubble!

10649,LRH,92," Haha. That's not the real bubble. It's just a prop for the tourists. This is the real deal

10650,Both,92," Ooh!

10651,LRH,92," [snarls] Summon the Atlantean Royal Guard! [The guards come and grunt, SpongeBob and Patrick shakes in fear for what they've done] Seize these hostile bubble poppers! [SpongeBob and Patrick scream and Squidward and Mr. Krabs join them]

Now bow before the new king of Atlantis and prepare to taste my wrath! [He stomps on the switch, and the switch didn't budge] Yeah! Huh? Uh, uh I mean, uh, prepare to taste my wrath! [He stomps on the switch rapidly harder, but it still didn't budge] Oh, you! [Grabs a rock while struggling] Prepare to taste my wrath! [Throws the rock on the switch, and the switch budged]

10668,Computer,92," Launch sequence employed! [The tank shakes and Plankton laughs diabolically, everyone gasped and they held each other. The tank shoots out ice cream and a cow's moo is heard, SpongeBob and Patrick starts eating the ice cream]

10744,Patrick,93," Oh, sorry, SpongeBob. I just came over to borrow some jelly.
",5
10745,SpongeBob,93," Well, go ahead, but I don't have time to play right now. I am late for picture day, and I just can't seem to get to school without being covered by unsightly debris. If only I had a sealed barrier to protect me from the filth of the outside world.
",5
10746,Patrick,93," I have a solution. [licks up all the jelly]
",5
10747,SpongeBob,93," Ew!
",5
10748,Patrick,93," Ah. I have solved my hunger problem.
",5
10749,SpongeBob,93," That's it! [jumps in the jar] This jelly jar will insulate me from the dirty dregs of Bikini Bottom. If you don't mind, Patrick, we don't have much time. [Patrick runs to the Boating School with SpongeBob still in the jar]
",5
10750,Patrick,93," We're here. Hey, what did I bring jelly for?
",5
10751,SpongeBob,93," Uh, Patrick...
",5
10752,Patrick,93," Oh, yeah. I was gonna put it on this peanut butter taco.
",5
10753,SpongeBob,93," No, no, no, no, no, Patrick! I'm not jelly, I'm not jelly! [is poured into the taco]
",5
10754,Patrick,93," SpongeBob, get out of my taco! [SpongeBob stands up. A taco shell is seen going down his face. SpongeBob looks down to see that he is covered in peanut butter. He cries] What's the matter, SpongeBob?
",5
10755,SpongeBob,93," Patrick, I just wanted to take a decent picture today because someday, I will graduate from Boating School and I don't want to be remembered as the guy covered in peanut butter and taco shells! [SpongeBob continues sniveling]
",5
10756,Mrs. Puff,93," Oh, there you are. [takes SpongeBob inside. Patrick licks his taco. Meanwhile, the photographer is taking another lady's picture]
",5
10757,Photographer,93," Say cheese. [takes the picture]
",5
10758,Mrs. Puff,93," And here's the last one. Now, just give a nice smile to the camera, SpongeBob.
",5
10759,SpongeBob,93," Wait, can I go home and change first?
",5
10760,Photographer,93," No time. Say cheese.
",5
10761,SpongeBob,93," [sobbing] Cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese!
",5
10762,Photographer,93," Quit that moody brooding. This will clean you up. [takes a hose and sprays the peanut butter off with water] Don't snivel like that. A winner doesn't snivel. Try putting this on. [SpongeBob puts on a green outfit] This is it. Now you are looking like a winner. [SpongeBob cries when he looks at his outfit]
",5
10763,Mrs. Puff,93," SpongeBob, please stop crying so he can take the picture.
",5
10764,Photographer,93," Do not worry, Mrs. Puff. I brought Pearlie.
",5
10765,SpongeBob,93," I can't stop crying!
",5
10766,Photographer,93," [opens up his briefcase that has a giant pair of dentures in it] This will make you smile, yeah, whether you want to or not. [puts the giant teeth in SpongeBob's mouth] Now say cheese.
",5
10767,SpongeBob,93," Cheese. [picture is taken. Later at home] There I am. [looking at his cautious memories book] Hey, I don't look so bad after all! [everyone in the book is smiling like SpongeBob]",5

Using the sheer force of my awesomely developed musculature. [puffs out his chest. Goes to the bathroom and has trouble opening up the toothpaste. He deflates to his normal size and goes to get a wrench from under his alarm clock. Goes back to the bathroom and hits the wrench on the toothpaste, causing the top to ricocheted off some things in the bathroom before hitting SpongeBob in the eye. He looks in the mirror to see if he has a black eye] Whew, what a relief. For a second there I thought I gave myself a black... [slips on the toothpaste top and hits his eye on the wrench] ...eye. [Looks in the mirror at his black eye. Starts crying in bed which startles Gary, Gary comes up to bed]

",5
10800,Gary,94," Meow?
",5
10801,SpongeBob,94," I did something so dumb to myself that even you would laugh uncontrollably at me.
",5
10802,Gary,94," [disagreeing] Meow.
",5
10803,SpongeBob,94," You promise you won't laugh? [Gary nods] Ok, here goes. [lifts his head off the bed] Gary, I gave myself a black eye trying to open the toothpaste. [Gary restraints from snickering] Thanks for not laughing, Gere. I knew you'd... [Gary leaves through his pet door] Gere...? [cut to SpongeBob leaving his house with pink sunglasses on. He looks around and sees no one around so he walks out but runs into Patrick]
",5
10804,Patrick,94," Hi, SpongeBob. Hey, cool glasses. Can I try them on... oh! [takes off the sunglasses and sees SpongeBob's black eye] SpongeBob, your eye. It's all black and swollen. How'd you mess your eye up, SpongeBob? Did somebody hit you? Where is he? Yeah, we'll settle this like men. We'll sue him.
",5
10805,SpongeBob,94," No, no, it's okay, Patrick. He... uh, he learned his lesson. [thinking of the toothpaste]
",5
10806,Patrick,94," Are you sure, SpongeBob? Who was this guy, anyway?
",5
10807,SpongeBob,94," Hmm... [thinking of Crazyfish] Jack M. Crazyfish. You've never seen anyone like this guy, Patrick. He was about 60 feet tall.
",5
10808,Patrick,94," [quivering] Oh.
",5
10809,SpongeBob,94," He was big and mean. Oh, but ol' SpongeBob here knows how to teach a lummox some manners.
",5
10810,Patrick,94," What did you do?
",5
10811,SpongeBob,94," I handled him the same way I handle all enormous muscle-bound villains.
",5
10812,Patrick,94," With tears?
",5
10813,SpongeBob,94," Uh, no, with a little hi-yah! and a ka-zow! and a gallon of hi-yah, hi-yah, ha! Yeah, he never knew what his him.
",5
10814,Patrick,94," Then what happened?
",5
10815,SpongeBob,94," I woke up... Oh, I mean, I...
",5
10816,Patrick,94," I know exactly what you mean. You whooped him with your eyes closed.
",5
10817,SpongeBob,94," That is exactly what I mean, Patrick. Well, see you later, buddy. [walks off]
",5
10818,Patrick,94," There goes a real hero.
",5
10819,SpongeBob,94," [makes karate sounds] Slugger, that's me. [stops a sea cow crossing] What the? [Sandy is riding a sea horse and taming the sea cows]
",5
10820,Sandy,94," Yee-haw! Get along little fishies.
",5
10821,SpongeBob,94," Hi, Sandy.
",5
10822,Sandy,94," Whoa! [sea horse stops] Hot cat snake in a barn. Look at your eye. Land sakes. That's quite a shiner you got there. Well, don't you worry none. I know some natural remedies that'll...
",5
10823,SpongeBob,94," Keep your natural remedies to yourself. Manly dudes like me don't need 'em. I'll have you know that I got this black eye in a fight.
",5
10824,Sandy,94," A fight? Well, there's no shame in losing.
",5
10825,SpongeBob,94," Lose? Sandy, I taught the fish who tangled with me a lesson he shan't soon forget.
",5
10826,Sandy,94," Why? Did he write it down?
",5
10827,SpongeBob,94," No, I engraved it on his pain gland.
",5
10828,Sandy,94," Well, what type of man scuffles boots with you and loses?
",5
10829,SpongeBob,94," Oh, this was no mere man. He was the notorious outlaw Jack M. Crazfish!
",5
10830,Sandy,94," Jack M. Crazyfish?
",5
10831,SpongeBob,94," It all happened late last night... [flashback to last night where SpongeBob is walking down the road] I was walking home from work... alone when all of a sudden, Crazyfish sprang up out of nowhere. He threw a giant tire at the back of my head. [Crazyfish laughs after throwing the tire] Then, he stood over me to gloat. I jumped up and karate kicked his hairpiece right off of its snaps. [Crazyfish walks away crying] He was so ashamed he ran all the way home leaving behind a pool of tears. Which I then proceeded to scoop up in my victory tankard and enjoy a nice refreshing beverage.
",5
10832,Sandy,94," So how'd you get the black eye then?
",5
10833,SpongeBob,94," Oh, yeah, that's right. I had miscalculated the trajectory of my cup and the straw jabbed me in the eye, giving me this awful shiner. [watch beeps]
",5
10834,Sandy,94," Well, looks like you're late for your day job, killer.
",5
10835,SpongeBob,94," Ah, phooey. Late schmate. A tough guy like me can show up to work whenever he wants. Adios. [cut to Krusty Krab]
",5
10836,Mr. Krabs,94," SpongeBob is 13-1/2 minutes late for duty. I hope for his sake this means he was in a horrible accident. [SpongeBob kicks the doors open and looks around trying to look tough] Well, looks like I was right about the accident part. [SpongeBob walks up to a fish and shows the black eye he goy]
",5
10837,Harold,94," Oh.
",5
10838,SpongeBob,94," Yeah, that's right, pal, do the right thing. Just keep on walking. [walks up to a table of two fish]
",5
10839,Fish #2,94," Do you mind? We're trying to have a decent meal here.
",5
10840,SpongeBob,94," That's right. [SpongeBob walks up to Squidward. Clears his throat]
",5
10841,Squidward,94," SpongeBob, I'm...
",5
10842,SpongeBob,94," Dah-dah-dah-dah, I'm just gonna stop you right there, Squidward. Spare you the oxygen. We all know you weaker folk can't afford to waste it. [takes the microphone] All right, folks, listen up 'cause I'm only gonna say this once. Tough guys don't like to repeat themselves. I'm talking to you, grandma! [Gramma puts down the mustard] Now I suppose all of you are wondering how I got this black eye.
",5
10843,Squidward,94," Not really.
",5
10844,SpongeBob,94," All right, who said that? Was it you, grandma?
",5
10845,Squidward,94," It was me, I said it. [SpongeBob turns around and hisses at Squidward]
",5
10846,SpongeBob,94," Well, folks, I don't happen to see it as a shiner so much as a shining trophy of my glorious triumph over the forces of evil. Oh, I know what you're thinking. Who in the name of Neptune would want to tangle with a guy like SpongeBob SquarePants? Well, I'll tell you who. [flashback to this morning] It was a peaceful morning in Bikini Bottom. I emerged from my fruit-shaped bungalow fresh as a bee when a wanted cry of distress pounded against my eardrum. [lady screams]
",5
10847,Harold,94," Hold it. Sponges don't have eardrums.
",5
10848,Mr. Krabs,94," He's right.
",5
10849,SpongeBob,94," Hey, let's save all the questions until the end. As I was saying... I quickly located the source of the cry which was a victim tied at my feet. [lady continues to scream while tied to a railroad track] ""Don't worry, I'll save you."" I assured... when a large bowling pin struck me in the face. The hurler was none other than Jack M. Crazyfish. And I could tell by that cold sore on his lip that today he meant business. With cat-like reflexes I preempted his attack. But the scoundrel had me sabotaged. And I fell face down on a pile of extra large staples. He lunged at me but I got him in the ribs with my novelty feather duster. Down he fell like a mighty oak. [slow howl... thud] And there he lay. The very thought of being vanquished made Jack M. Crazyfish burst into tears. [he cries] The force of his tears was so strong I had to take evasive action. But one of the blasts went haywire and hit me right in the face... [one of the tears bounces off a rock and hits SpongeBob in the eye] ...and that's how I got this black eye and gave Jack M. Crazyfish a whomping of a lifetime. Whoo...football!
",5
10850,Dale,94," Uh, what did you say he looked like again?
",5
10851,SpongeBob,94," Oh, kind of tall, handlebar mustache...
",5
10852,Dale,94," Little green hat?
",5
10853,SpongeBob,94," I kind of thought it was teal but that sounds like him all right. Wait a second, how did you know he was wearing a green hat? [SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, and Squidward gasp] He's... real.
",5
10854,Jack M. Crazyfish,94," I'm looking for SpongeBob SquarePants.
",5
10855,SpongeBob,94," Mr Crazyfish, please don't skin me alive. I made all that stuff up. I was just kidding about whomping you, right folks? You remember.
",5
10856,Gramma,94," I liked the part where you told us where how he was crying like a baby. [SpongeBob runs home]
",5
10857,SpongeBob,94," Hi, Gary. [runs back with toothpaste and wrench] All right, look. I had a toothpaste tube, like this. But I couldn't get it open 'cause the cap was stuck. And I guess...I haven't been working my arms out that much lately. And I opened it up like this... [hits the toothpaste with the wrench] Then I was walkin', like this. [walks over to the toothpaste top] And I didn't see where the cap went, like this. [slips on the top and hits himself in the eye with the wrench] So, I slipped on it and I landed right on my wrench, like this. And I gave myself a black eye, like this. [points to his left eye] Uh... like these. [points to both eyes being black] So you see? I made it all up so I could keep from looking stupid. Makes sense, doesn't it?
",5
10858,Jack M. Crazyfish,94," Uh, not really. I'm here cause I heard you make a really good Krabby Patty. [cut to SpongeBob bringing a plate with a Krabby Patty with 6 patties on it to Crazyfish]
",5
10859,SpongeBob,94," One super hot and delicious custom order Krabby Patty with extra sauce, mi lord. Served directly to your waiting [slips and throws the patty into Crazyfish's face] Head and neck area. Sir, please, I am so sorry.
",5
10860,Jack M.Crazyfish,94," Where I come from we settle things in a different kind of way. [play a game of rock-paper-scissors like before with SpongeBob holding out paper while Crazyfish holds out a rock but changes it to scissors]
",5

",5

",5
10875,Patrick,95," Yep! [We then see the normal bubble transition. We're now in the entrance to the scary boat with the Warden in front of it]
",5
10876,SpongeBob,95," [to the Warden] ...this stuff is just my carry-on, quarter. [We see them smiling, with SpongeBob carrying 2 purses, and Patrick holding a wooden coffin] The rest of my things are right over there. [SpongeBob points to where they are, and the Warden gets angry, and starts growling. SpongeBob tosses his stuff to the Warden, and runs in. Patrick does the same.]
",5

10878,Warden,95," Welcome to Inferno Island! [We then see SpongeBob and Patrick, screaming with joy] [yelling] What in the seven seas just insulted my ear drum!?

Because it so happens that it is my sworn duty to think of fun things to do with the trash that society has thrown away!
",5
10879,SpongeBob,95," [Whispering to Patrick] I had always preferred to recycle. [Everyone starts to snicker, except the Warden. We hear a whistle, and then we span up to SpongeBob and Patrick]
",5
10880,Warden,95," Holy fishpaste! We got ourselves a couple of ""rabble rousers"". What's your name, son?
",5
10881,SpongeBob,95," SpongeBob SquarePants! [He says it very happily]
",5
10882,Warden,95," And are you a rabble rouser?
",5
10883,SpongeBob,95," [Chuckles for a second] Funny you should ask... once I had...
",5
10884,Warden,95," Well I hope you aren't, because you sure look mighty tasty. It isn't too soon after breakfast for me to want to chew somebody's head off!
",5
10885,Patrick,95," [Whispers to SpongeBob] Actually, I am a little hungry.
",5
10886,Warden,95," Hungry?! Barney, fetch these two poor hungry souls a snack. On the double! [Barney then comes back and throws tires in front of them. SpongeBob and Patrick look at the tires, and we hear bicycle horns going off. We then see the Warden and Barney, and we hear SpongeBob and Patrick eat the tires. We then see some prisoners]
",5
10887,Prisoner #1,95," Ohh. These guys are tough! [We then see SpongeBob and Patrick with full bellies]
",5
10888,Patrick,95," The food coma is setting in.
",5
10889,SpongeBob,95," Yeah. I could use a nap. [The Warden comes up quickly, and startles them]
",5
10890,Warden,95," Did you just say nap?! Well, I know the perfect place for you two to go digest that meal. [We see them smiling, and the bubble transition comes up again. We see them both in a hole in the ground that's shaped like a cube, and with a barred window-like door at the top] A couple days in the hole never hurt anybody. [They close the door, and we go to SpongeBob and Patrick. We see SpongeBob laying on a corpse]
",5
10891,SpongeBob,95," This camp is very upscale! [We then see 3 prisoners carrying a metal tub labeled ""chum"" on it. At the top, we do see some chum dripping out. We then see the chum has a bone, shoe, and an eyeball in it. The prisoners then dump it into the hole.]
",5
10892,Patrick,95," I had no idea that they had a hot tub! [We then see a timecard that says ""Three days later""]
",5
10893,Narrator,95," three days later
",5
10894,Warden,95," Alright! Let them out! [Someone who looks like Barney opens the door. The Warden looks at the prisoners] Now pay attention, worms. Watch the way they crawl out on their bellies, begging for mercy, and see what's waiting for you, next time you fell up to same way these two did! [Warden looks at them, and notices. We see SpongeBob and Patrick with their body all chunky. SpongeBob's head is like a boxed bubble, and Patrick is all chubby]
",5
10895,SpongeBob,95," It was quite an enjoyable soap, but it wasn't until this guy got thirsty and decided to drink the bath water!
",5
10896,Patrick,95," Not bad! Except for this aftertaste. [Patrick's breath reaches its way to the Warden and the Warden smells it. His eyes get big in disgust. The prisoners are now coughing, because it smells so bad]
",5
10897,Warden,95," Cut your traps, all of ya, because of that little outburst, I am going to treat you all to an activity so heart-wrenchingly boring, it physically exhausting, that it is guaranteed to render your souls broken beyond repair!
",5
10898,SpongeBob & Patrick,95," Yay! [Another bubble transition occurs, and then we are at in a mine, where the prisoners are mining the rocks. They all look bored, except for SpongeBob and Patrick]
",5
10899,SpongeBob,95," This is a pretty fun camp game, huh Patrick?
",5
10900,Patrick,95," Yeah!
",5
10901,SpongeBob,95," It's made it even more fun and challenging by the fact that we're wearing these heavy ankle weights. [We zoom out to a view of Inferno Island, where we see it's storming even worse. We then go in where they sleep]
",5
10902,'Warden,95," [In background. We now see SpongeBob in ""bed""] Good night, ladies! [We then hear the prisoners complaining, and then SpongeBob pats his pillow, grabs it, and notices that it's made out of paper. SpongeBob gets on the side of his bed and sighs]
",5
10903,Patrick,95," What's wrong, SpongeBob? [We now know that Patrick is on the bottom bunk]
",5
10904,SpongeBob,95," The other campers just aren't having as much fun as you and me.
",5
10905,Patrick,95," If only we could think of some sort group activity that we can all do together, then we would all be having the same amount of fun as each other. [Patrick rolls to his right, and we hear sliding] Good night! [We then hear the usual idea noise, and we see SpongeBob has a light bulb above his head]
",5
10906,Warden,95," Rise and shine! [Everyone gets in a line in front of the Warden] Now, which one of you vile, low-down, vile miserable wretched swine left this pathetic, worthless, horror and meaningless... [Breathes deeply]
",5
10907,SpongeBob,95," [SpongeBob then raises his right arm, and points with one finger up] Uh... abomination?
",5
10908,Warden,95," Who said that?
",5
10909,SpongeBob,95," Me, sir! [SpongeBob waves with his right arm, while being perky]
",5
10910,Warden,95," What is the meaning of this thing?
",5
10911,SpongeBob,95," It's a play, for our amusement, and inspiration! [Warden backs up, and looks like he's in shock, and then ponders]
",5
10912,Warden,95," Good. Well then, I'll watch your play, and I will enjoy every act of your pathetic, meaningless, ridiculous, production. You know why?
",5

10941,Warden,95," Encore! Encore! Encore! Do it again! [Curtain raises by itself, revealing the boat is gone, and SpongeBob and Patrick are standing there, all by themselves] What the?! [The boat starts to sink, as they sail away]

10942,Prisoner #2,95," Turn the ship around! [other prisoners starts turning the ship. We then notice that the boat isn't complete, as it only had one side. The ship sinks.]

Bert cannot attempt to describe the disgusting, vile, th-th-the complete disregard for the story tradition of musical theatre. So, startin' this very moment, every one of you will be sentenced to...

10946,Warden,95," What in the name of... [The Camp Counselor goes up on the deck, and coughs for swimming hard] For Neptune's sake man, speak the King's English!

10948,Warden,95," Your who-what?

10950,Warden,95," Enough. So tell me Counselor, just what do they do on your Sunny Funny Island?

10951,Camp Counselor,95," Well, we uh make macaroni art...

10956,Warden,95," These heinous activities sound like torture too severe for even the lowest, filthiest, undeserving... [He gets an idea] Wait a minute! I have a brilliant idea!

11005,SpongeBuck,96," Wow! The big city! Well, time to make my fortune.

",5
11028,SpongeBuck,96," Sheriff? I'm not here for the sheriff job. I'm here for the fry cook job. [Holds up the same paper but points to an ad that says 'Fry cook wanted Low pay/No Benefits'] Back home, I'm known for my rootin-tootin, never-pootin chili. The spiciest chili west of the old west farm. [Krabs tries it and spits it out]
",5
11029,William Krabs,96," No offense, kid. But your chili tastes terrible.

11083,SpongeBuck,96," I ain't no sheriff. Or fry cook or even coffin jockey, and I'm no match for Dead Eye Plankton! I'm nothing. [Pecos Patrick slaps him]
",5
11084,Pecos Patrick,96," Out west, a man gets right back up on his coffin and faces his problems with the help of his idiot sidekick friend! That's me! [Shows a badly drawn picture of Pecos Patrick] Duhhh... 
",5
11085,SpongeBuck,96," I don't know, [slaps him again] Okay, okay! I'll do it! Just stop hurtin' me! Besides, you're right! It's time I stepped up and looked him in the eye! So, I'll go back to Dead Eye Gulch, whip Plankton, and save the town at high noon!
",5
11086,Pecos Patrick,96," Hop on, buddy!
",5
11087,SpongeBuck,96," Thanks, idiot friend! But I don't know how we'll ever get back to Dead Eye Gulch by high noon.
",5
11088,Pecos Patrick,96," Don't worry. I got a short-cut. He-ya! [Starts riding coffin, rides over a cliff, both land on a cactus, both start flying toward Dead Eye Gulch, in Dead Eye Gulch, a carriage is riding around town]
",5
11089,Polene Puff,96," Why are we going so fast?
",5
11090,William Krabs,96," 'Cause without a sheriff, Dead Eye won't stop until he has the clothes off our backs! [Dead Eye is in the road]
",5
11091,Dead Eye Plankton,96," [Laughs evilly] Great idea! [Scene cuts to where William Krabs, Polene Puff, and Hopalong have no clothes on but their underclothes] Okay, let's see, [checking off a list] personal possessions, clothes off your backs, that should about do it! Look, I'm just going to drop off all my new stuff at the bank. I'll be back at high noon to rub my victory in your face with a little dance. Uh huh, waa-waa! Uh huh, waa-waa!
",5
11092,Hopalong,96," I gotta admit, he's got skills.
",5
11093,Dead Eye Plankton,96," That's right! And when I take the deed to your saloon Krabs, I'll own every building in town! And you'll all have to work for me the rest of your miserable lives! [laughs but then coughs] Swallowed a bug! I hate that. It totally ruins an evil laugh. Yee-how! [Rides off]
",5
11094,William Krabs,96," So, that's it.
",5
11095,Polene Puff,96," We lost.

11096,Hopalong,96," I don't know how it could get any worse. [SpongeBuck and Pecos Patrick start falling]

11097,SpongeBuck,96," Hi, guys! I'm back in the nick of time!
",5
11098,Pecos Patrick,96," We're heroes!
",5
11099,Hopalong,96," You're morons!
",5
11100,Polene Puff,96," It's too late. Plankton's taken everything!
",5
11101,Polene Puff,96," Well, I guess the early bird gets the worm.
",5
11102,Hopalong,96," And all our stuff.
",5
11103,William Krabs,96," And me money! Me beautiful, beautiful money!
",5
11104,SpongeBuck,96," You can't give up! Before I came here, I would've given up, too. But in the short 20 minutes I've known you, I've come to love Dead Eye Gulch.
",5
11105,William Krabs,96," Could you get to the point? We're freezing!
",5
11106,SpongeBuck,96," What I'm a saying is if we all team up together, we can stand up to Dead Eye Plankton, and run him right out of Dead Eye Gulch for good! So, what do you say?
",5
11107,William Krabs,96," Well, I think we all know the answer.
",5
11108,All,96," Forget it, SpongeBuck!
",5
11109,Pecos Patrick,96," Why are you all standing in your pajamas? No, don't tell me. Oh, I know! You're throwing a slumber party! Pillow fight! [Whacks Hopalong with his pillow, laughs, then whacks SpongeBuck]
",5
11110,SpongeBuck,96," That pillow sure packs a wallop!
",5
11111,Pecos Patrick,96," It's made out of wood, [Pulls out a wooden log inside the pillow] like all pillows in the old west. Round 2?
",5
11112,SpongeBuck,96," I do believe I'd sit this one out.
",5
11113,Pecos Patrick,96," Looks like it's just you and me, kid. [Whacks himself with the log]
",5
11114,SpongeBuck,96," Come on, guys! We can do this! If we work together!
",5
11115,William Krabs,96," No offense, kid. But your advice is as terrible as your chili.
",5
11116,SpongeBuck,96," I don't blame you for losing faith. I lost faith too. But then, I discovered the love of my new idiot friend. And we've come far. So I'm sure with all of us working together, in idiot friendship, we can beat Dead Eye and save the town! So let's huddle up and make a plan, together! Bzbzbzbzbzb
",5
11117,Pecos Patrick,96," Uh huh,
",5
11118,SpongeBuck,96," Bzbzbzbzbzbzb
",5
11119,Pecos Patrick,96," Uh huh, uh huh,
",5
11120,SpongeBuck,96," Bzbzbzbzbzbzbzbzb
",5
11121,Hopalong,96," Uh, SpongeBuck, why do you keep saying bzbzbzbzbzbzb?
",5
11122,SpongeBuck,96," Umm...
",5
11123,Hopalong,96," You don't have a plan, do you?
",5
11124,SpongeBuck,96," No. To be honest, I didn't think I'd get this far. [Everyone groans] But I know we can beat him! If we just work together!
",5
11125,Dead Eye Plankton,96," Oh, I am terrified.
",5
11126,All,96," Dead Eye Plankton?!
",5
11127,Dead Eye Plankton,96," So, fry cook, you're back! And all alone.
",5
11128,SpongeBuck,96," You wish, Dead Eye! We are united! Right g-- Hey! [All of SpongeBuck's friends are hiding at the Krusty Kantina]
",5
11129,William Krabs,96," We're right behind you boy! WAY WAY behind you!
",5
11130,Dead Eye Plankton,96," So, it's come to this. Mano y mano.
",5
11131,SpongeBuck,96," Well, you can hold the mano, because it's come down to you and me!
",5
11132,William Krabs,96," Can I try?
",5
11133,Dead Eye Plankton,96," You can't do this! [Steps on Dead Eye repeatedly]
",5
11134,Pecos Patrick,96," Three yee-haws for SpongeBuck!
",5
11135,Citizens of Dead Eye Gulch,96," Yee-Haw! Yee-Haw! Yee-Haw! [scene cuts to where Krabs is holding a line to step on Dead Eye at the Krusty Kantina]
",5
11136,Mr. Krabs,96," Step right up, folks! Just a dollar to stomp on old Dead Eye Plankton!
",5
11137,Dead Eye Plankton,96," Ah! Ouch! Ooh!
",5
11138,Polene Puff,96," Take that, you no-good little varmint!
",5
11139,Dead Eye Plankton,96," I have a lot of money! [Gets squished by her boot.]
",5
11140,Pecos Patrick,96," Well, sheriff, you beat Dead Eye Plankton and saved the town. [SpongeBuck drinks a glass of milk, but Pecos Patrick spills his, both say Ahh]
",5
11141,SpongeBuck,96," You forgot the most important part. I discovered the power of idiot friendship. [Shows a badly drawn picture of them both going Duhhh...]
",5
11142,Pecos Patrick,96," Come with me, I want to show you something.
",5
11143,William Krabs,96," Thank you sheriff SpongeBuck for saving our town. And for stepping on that little varmint.
",5
11144,Dead Eye Plankton,96," History will vindicate me! [Gets stepped on by Pecos Patrick]
",5
11145,William Krabs,96," We melted down Plankton's gold and made a statue in your honor. [Pulls off a sheet revealing a golden statue of SpongeBuck on a coffin]
",5
11146,Citizens of Dead Eye Gulch,96," Oooh!
",5
11147,Hopalong,96," I liked my design better. [Shows a piece of paper with his idea on it, but it is him]
",5
11148,William Krabs,96," Sorry about the whole tricking you into being sheriff thing. And to make it up to you, I've got a new badge for you. If you'll take it. [Puts the badge on SpongeBuck]
",5
11149,SpongeBuck,96," Wow! Fry cook! [Everyone starts clapping] Thank you, good people of Bikini Gulch! The statue is truly amazing! Maybe a little too heavy in the hindquarters, but still, if I ever have a Great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandson, I'd want him to look at this and say 'Hey! I'm proud of my Great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandfather!'
",5
11150,Citizens of Bikini Gulch,96," Aaw!
",5
11151,Fish #8,96," Say seaweed! [Picture takes, story ends]
",5
11152,SpongeBob,96," So my Great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandpa SpongeBuck saved the town of Bikini Gulch! And everyone in it! I wonder what happened to the statue of my Great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandpa. [Sandy and SpongeBob walk out of the library] It was much better than that one we have now. [Both walk by the statue SpongeBob saw earlier]
",5
11153,Sandy,96," Yeah, and it's covered in jellyfish poop.
",5
11154,SpongeBob,96," Wait a minute, [Goes over and starts to pick at the jellyfish poop]
",5
11155,Sandy,96," Gross! Don't touch that, SpongeBob! Eeew! What are you doing?! [SpongeBob wipes the poop off the statue to reveal gold] That boy ain't hooked up right.
",5
11156,SpongeBob,96," Look, Sandy!
",5
11157,Sandy,96," HUH? [The statue reveals to be the SpongeBuck statue]
",5
11158,SpongeBob,96," SpongeBuck was here all the long! Sorry Great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandpa. I didn't recognize you all covered in poop.
",5
11159,Sandy,96," Wow!
",5
11160,SpongeBob,96," I've got a lot to live up to. Maybe one day people will know the name SpongeBob SquarePants!
",5
11161,Sandy,96," Keep dreaming, SpongeBob. Keep dreaming. [The jellyfish float back to the golden statue. Scene cuts to the Krusty Kantina where SpongeBuck is on stage]
",5
11162,SpongeBuck,96," Hey, Everybody! It's good to be here at the Krusty Kantina! We got a real special show for y'all tonight! Featuring my new best pal, this guy! [Pecos Patrick gets on stage,] He's an idiot! [Everyone cheers]

",5
11228,Mr. Krabs,97," I don't understand, Squidward. Where are all the customers? I know the Krusty Krab isn't Bikini Bottom's most prestigious eatery, but at least it's better than that salty old Chum Bucket across the street. And that's our only competition.
",5
11229,Squidward,97," Am I getting paid extra for this conversation?
",5
11230,Mr. Krabs,97," Oh, come on, Squidward. Can't you just pretend to listen for once in your life? Do it for old Mr. Krabs.
",5
11231,Squidward,97," Well, since you can't bring any customers into the Krusty Krab, have you ever thought about bringing the Krusty Krab to the customers?
",5
11232,Mr. Krabs,97," Quiet, Squidward, I'm brainstorming! Ooh, ooh! What if instead of bringing customers to the Krusty Krab, we could bring the Krusty Krab to the customers?
",5

",5
11234,Mr. Krabs,97," Yes, of course! But how? [the submarine crashes into the Krusty Krab]

11235,SpongeBob,97," Can we park here? [Squidward looks up] Hey, Mr. Krabs! Look what Patrick and I found! We're gonna use it to go on a long journey.
",5
11236,Patrick,97," Or even around the block!
",5
11237,Mr. Krabs,97," That's it! We'll take the Krusty Krab on the road. [cuts to outside] So long, boys. Make me lots of money!

11261,Mable,97," Hey, you can't talk to my son that way! Who do you think you are?
",5
11262,Plankton,97," I'm Plankton, you old hag. And your son smells like boogers.
",5
11263,Truck Driver,97," Hey, you can't talk about my wife that way. What do you think this is?
",5
11264,Plankton,97," I think it's time for you to lose some weight, fatty. That's what this is.
",5
11265,Mary,97," Hey, you can't talk to my grandson like that. Someone oughta put you in a mental hospital.
",5
11266,Plankton,97," Someone should put you in a box floating down the river, Grandma!
",5
11267,Mary,97," You're probably right.
",5
11268,Plankton,97," You people are crazy. I'm getting out of here. [a person throws a rock at Plankton] What the? [People start throwing rocks] No! Controls malfunctioning! [people continue to throw rocks]
",5
11269,SpongeBob,97," Hey, Patrick.
",5
11270,Patrick,97," Yeah?
",5
11271,SpongeBob,97," Weren't you supposed to be on kitchen duty? [cut to the kitchen, where the patties are burnt] Oh, no. You burnt all the patties. It's hard as a rock. How are we gonna find somebody who would buy these?

11272,Truck Driver,97," [sees there are no more rocks] Hey, the rocks are all gone.

11273,Crowd,97," Aww! [Plankton smiles, but sees SpongeBob coming]

11274,SpongeBob,97," Folks, have I got a deal for you. [the crowd sees the hard patties. They buy them and proceed to hit Plankton with them]
",5
11275,Jack,97," Alright, get 'em! [they start to throw the patty rocks at Plankton]
",5
11276,SpongeBob,97," Won't Mr. Krabs be so proud of us when he finds out how good we're doing. See any new customers, Patrick?
",5
11277,SpongeBob,97," Here, let me see. [looks through periscope] No, Patrick, that says ""Abyss.""
",5
11278,Patrick,97," Oh, OK. What's an abyss, SpongeBob?
",5
11279,SpongeBob,97," An abyss is a bottomless... [SpongeBob turns around, the submarine falls down the abyss] ...chasm! [an alarm goes off] Pat, we're falling!
",5
11280,Patrick,97," And now we're being bathed in an eerie red light!
",5
11281,Plankton,97," [he sees them falling] Yes! Yes!
",5
11282,Patrick,97," [the submarine loses its bolts and breaks in the water] And now a deafening warning siren! [SpongeBob imitates the sound. the submarine hits a sludgy item, which turns out to be the head of the Sea Monster]
",5
11283,Sea Monster,97," [shouts]
",5
11284,SpongeBob,97," Look, Patrick! We've floated back up, out of the deep, dark, depressing, horrible abyss! [looks at the Sea Monster]
",5
11285,Sea Monster,97," Hey! [he grabs the submarine] Who are you calling dark and depressing?
",5
11286,SpongeBob,97," Daa! We didn't mean it that way, Mr. Sea Monster, sir! What we really wanna know is... are you hungry?
",5
11287,Sea Monster,97," Hungry? I've been asleep for 79 years. Which means my last meal was 79 years ago. Yes, I'm hungry.
",5
11288,SpongeBob,97," Then try one of our Krabby Patties.
",5
11289,Sea Monster,97," [he eats the Krabby Patty] Mmm! That's the best thing I've tasted since that sewer spill...back in '76. I'll take 640 of them.
",5
11290,SpongeBob and Patrick,97," Woo hoo!
",5
11291,Patrick,97," Order... uh... up! [the Sea Monster gives them large wads of cash]
",5
11292,Plankton,97," Now that those two are out of the picture, all of the customers will come running to me. [looks at the Sea Monster paying them big money [literally], he rips off the periscope] This calls for drastic-er-est measures! [Plankton goes into the abyss] Okay, you bums, time for the second course; Chum Charges!
",5
11293,Patrick,97," [the Chum Charges explode around the submarine] SpongeBob! Our hull's been breached. Do you know what that means?
",5
11294,SpongeBob,97," No!

11295,Patrick,97," [a close up to SpongeBob & Patrick] Neither do I!
",5
11296,Plankton,97," Yes! I sunk the Krusty Krab! I sunk the Krusty Krab! I sunk the... [Plankton sees the vehicle crashing into a cavern wall] Ah, who needs that old Rust Bucket anyhow.
",5
11297,Sea Monster,97," Come on in there! I want more sandwiches!
",5
11298,Patrick,97," [a piece of chum enters the submarine] SpongeBob, look!
",5
11299,SpongeBob,97," What is it?
",5
11300,Patrick,97," It's a liquid.
",5
11301,SpongeBob,97," No, it's a solid! It's a solid!
",5
11302,SpongeBob and Patrick,97," It's a ""lol-squid.""
",5
11303,Sea Monster,97," All right, what's going on in there? [he sees the Chum Patty] Hey, that looks like a sandwich to me!
",5
11304,SpongeBob,97," But not just a sandwich. It's a...Chum-Wich.
",5
11305,Sea Monster,97," [eats it and likes it] Mmm! Now that's a sandwich!
",5
11306,SpongeBob,97," [the monsters belly is still rumbling] Anything else before we shove off?
",5
11307,Sea Monster,97," I want dessert! [Plankton parachutes down]
",5
11308,SpongeBob,97," We- We don't have desserts.

11309,Plankton,97," [lands from his parachute] Don't give another penny to those fast-food phonies. That's right, they stole my idea. My, my, my... [the end of the periscope breaks off, he falls down and rolls into some wet mud]
",5
11310,Sea Monster,97," Hey, a chocolate éclair! [to audience] Now that looks like dessert to me!
",5
11311,Plankton,97," No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no! You- You've got it all wrong, see... Hey! [the Sea Monster chases Plankton through the abyss. cut to the Krusty Krab]

11315,Mr. Krabs,97," Tell me all about it. Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me!

11317,Mr. Krabs,97," I don't care about that. Tell me about the money.
",5
11318,SpongeBob,97," There we were at the bottom of a deep, dark, abyss. And we had to let go of something heavy.

11320,Mr. Krabs,97," You let go of all the money I earned as ballast?

11321,SpongeBob,97," [he and Patrick nod their heads, Mr. Krabs is upset] But on the bright side, we did manage to bring back 37,000 pounds of these decorative deep sea rocks!",5

",5
11420,SpongeBob,99," Hmmm... I know just what to do. [crowd chases Squidward and SpongeBob]
",5
11421,Mr. Krabs,99," Squidward? What have you done? You know what the Krusty Krab means to me, don't ya? And you took it upon yourself to bring all these, these customers, to me. Hey, don't worry folks, There's plenty of Squidward to go around. So everybody just line up and get your pocketbooks out, first will be a small fee of $14.98 per person everyone will get the opportunity to touch Squidward.

11422,Squidward,99," We don't have much time! Take the door and change me back.

11423,Mr. Krabs,99," And I'll even throw in a free soft drink for an extra $3.

11424,Squidward,99," Come on, SpongeBob. Take the door and smash my face back!
",5
11425,SpongeBob,99," I can't! It was one thing doing it by accident, but I can't hurt you on purpose.

11432,Squidward,99," Spo... hang on a sec [slams the door over and over again] ... let me... uhhhh... [Squidward becomes even more handsome]

",5
11456,Ms. Priss,10," Greetings. Although your establishment seems repugnant and foul in nature, it seems not to offend our sensitivities. It is for that reason, plus the fact that we have been stuck on a tour bus for several days, that my sisters and I would like to eat something here.

11538,Miss Priss,10," You missed one!

11539,Mr. Krabs,10," Oh, Ms. Gristlepuss! I'm sorry we sold Krabby Patties. But do you really have to send us to jail?

",5
11549,Al,10," [slow-motion] Oooooohhh... [in slow-motion, the Krabby Patty falls into Miss Priss's mouth. She chews and swallows it as Mr. Krabs, SpongeBob, and Al stare at her. She then opens her mouth]

11572,Squidward,101," [gasps] This isn't Squilliam Fancyson, my life long rival who I met in high school band class, is it?
",6
11573,Squilliam,101," The same. You wouldn't happen to be watching House Fancy, would you?
",6
11574,Squidward,101," I was, until you called.
",6
11575,Squilliam,101," Well Squiddy, I enjoy our chat, but my catered lunch awaits. And you know how hard being fabulous is on an empty stomach! [laughs]

11576,Squidward,101," Wait, why did you ask me if I was watching House Fancy?
",6
11577,Nick,101," [heard through phone] Sorry Squilliam, but we've gotta get back to the show.

",6
11583,Squilliam,101," Why thank you, Nick.
",6
11584,Nick,101," And your house doesn't look too bad either. [both laugh]

",6
11586,Nick,101," Camera crew, can we get a shot of Squilliam Fancyson's fabulous house, please? [zooms out, revealing that it looks like Squidward's house]

11587,Squidward,101," Hey, that's no better than my house! [goes up, revealing that it is much larger than Squidward's house. cuts to the inside of his house]

",6
11592,Nick,101," It's like I've died and gone to fancy heaven! [scene cuts to the opening background. The bird's head gets replaces the ""O"", then cuts back to Squilliam's house] Is that what I think it is?
",6
11593,Squilliam,101," It sure is! It's a gilded door knob.
",6
11594,Nick,101," Absolutely magical!
",6
11595,Squilliam,101," Absolutely imported.
",6
11596,Nick,101," May I?

",6
11599,Squilliam,101," Isn't it?
",6
11600,Nick,101," Well, I have to say Squilliam, and I think that I'm speaking for all of our viewers out there when I say this. You, are truly a fancy man.
",6
11601,Squilliam,101," Well, of all this gushing perfectly deserved. [Squidward is angry] And now, I'd like to present to you my most favorite room, in the house [Squilliam opens the door, revealing the bathroom] It's all custom. Ah, look at this, it's my jewel-encrusted toilet paper holder.
",6
11602,Nick,101," Such class! [Squidward is even more angry, then some houses turn into the title, then cuts to Nick and Squilliam]

",6
11605,Squilliam,101," Watch your step. [Squilliam opens the elevator, then they step inside, and press the button that says ""Roof""] This may take a while. Just sit back and relax. [water fills some of the elevator]
",6
11606,Nick,101," What the!? A whirl pool bath elevator?
",6
11607,Squilliam,101," I brought some soap. [Pours out soap. They then get to the roof] All ashore. Welcome, to my roof top garden! Romantic grotto, sparkling berry mineral soda waterfall, and my personal favorite, a 134-foot-long sculpture of my unibrow!
",6
11608,Nick,101," It's huge, and... lifelike!
",6
11609,Squilliam,101," If you look closely, you'll notice that it's made entirely out of gilded door knobs. [Closes in on the sculpture]

11611,Squilliam,101," What?

",6
11617,Squidward,101," Hello, my name is Squidward Tentacles, and my house is far fancier than that slob Squilliam's!
",6
11618,Nick,101," Really?
",6
11619,Squidward,101," Really!
",6
11620,Nick,101," Okay, we'll be at your house in two hours with a camera crew. [hangs up]
",6
11621,Squidward,101," [shocked] Two hours? But I haven't even got time to wash my hair. [screams] There's a stain on the rug! I'll just use this chair to hide it. There we go. Now I'll just... [screams again] There's a hideous hole in the wall! I'll just use this painting to cover it up. Perfect. [screams again, because there is a faded spot where the painting was] Oh no! [looks at the time] I'll never get this place in shape in time! [notices SpongeBob in the window, who quickly disappears. Squidward runs to the window] SpongeBob! How long have you been spying on me?
",6
11622,SpongeBob,101," Umm... What day is it?
",6
11623,Squidward,101," It's the day you go away, and never come back.
",6
11624,SpongeBob,101," But Squidward, if I do that, then how am I going to help you get your house ready for the big TV show?
",6
11625,Squidward,101," How'd you know about that?
",6
11626,SpongeBob,101," I was spying on you.
",6
11627,Squidward,101," Do you want me to get the cops down here again? Because... [looks at the time again, then sighs] All right, fine. But one slip up, and you are out of here. Comprendo? [SpongeBob is behind him]
",6
11628,SpongeBob,101," Mucho comprendo, Señor Habanero! [Cuts to later]
",6
11629,Squidward,101," All right, first of all I'm going to give you something so simple, that a person without a brain could even get it done right.
",6
11630,SpongeBob,101," Well that's good, because I lent my brain to Patrick for the weekend.
",6
11631,Squidward,101," Really?
",6
11632,SpongeBob,101," No, not really... He traded me these 2 chocolate bars for it.
",6
11633,Squidward,101," I don't care! Just use this paint to cover up that faded spot on the wall right there. Don't touch anything else!
",6
11634,SpongeBob,101," Okay. [SpongeBob picks up the brush, then throws it away and absorbs the paint, then splatters the paint around]
",6
11635,Squidward,101," SpongeBob, what was that noise? [screams] Skin me alive and drench me in boiling oil! What have you done to my living room? I told you just to paint the faded spot.
",6
11636,SpongeBob,101," Well, it all looked kinda faded. [Squidward hisses, then looks at the clock again]
",6
11637,Squidward,101," Never mind! Maybe it won't show up on camera. Here, help me move this sofa.
",6
11638,SpongeBob,101," You got it, Squiddy. Where are we moving her to?
",6
11639,Squidward,101," Hang on, I'm trying to get the grip on the thing. Now don't move it until I say... [SpongeBob moves it on his foot] Ow! Okay, it's on my foot. Now don't... [SpongeBob moves it again] Ow!
",6
11640,SpongeBob,101," Okay. [moves it again, ripping off Squidward's toenail]
",6
11641,Squidward,101," Ow! SpongeBob, I told you not to move it until I say... [SpongeBob drops it on his foot] Ow! Why do you keep moving it?
",6
11642,SpongeBob,101," Cause you keep saying ow! [Squidward screams, and lifts it up]
",6
11643,Squidward,101," I don't need you, I can move it myself. [slips on toenail, and trips]
",6
11644,SpongeBob,101," Wow Squidward, you're so strong! [there is a crash] And you split your sofa in half! It'll be really easy to move now. [doorbell rings]
",6
11645,Squidward,101," Oh no, they're already here! Go get a vacuum and clean up all the sofa bits. I've gotta run upstairs and dress my wound!
",6
11646,SpongeBob,101," Roger! [SpongeBob walks on screen with a vacuum] Okay, Squidward, found the vacuum! Squidward? Well, I'll just vacuum for him.[starts vacuuming] Hmm, Squidward's house is really messy. I'm going to need some extra power. [SpongeBob struggles to flip the switch, and the switch breaks. The vacuum goes haywire, and vacuums up a rug, a plant, a sculpture of Squidward, then the sofa, then the book case, then everything else]
",6
11647,Squidward,101," Okay, SpongeBob, I finished... What the? [everything in Squidward's house is in the vacuum, which looks as if it's about to explode]
",6
11648,SpongeBob,101," Don't worry, Squidward! I'll turn it off. [SpongeBob tries to turn it off, but gets sucked in]
",6
11649,Squidward,101," Come out of there. [doorbell rings again] Uh, hang on please. [Squidward tries to push the bag, and the door bell rings again] Please, just one more minute Nick! [door opens, and it's Patrick]
",6
11650,Patrick,101," Who's Nick? Sorry Squidward. I couldn't wait any longer, I've gotta use your toilet. No questions! Thanks. [Patrick runs into the bathroom. You hear him groan, then the toilet flushes, then he comes out] Phew! I wouldn't go in there for a couple days. Or weeks. [He leaves the house. Squidward's toilet comes out of his bathroom groaning]
",6
11651,Toilet,101," Please, please, somebody put me out of my misery! [toilet jumps into Squidward's hands, coughing] Have mercy on my soul...! [toilet dies, then Patrick opens the door again]
",6
11652,Patrick,101," Oh, hey Squidward, if you see SpongeBob, can you give him his brain back? I was borrowing it for the weekend. I'll just set it here. [Patrick puts his brain on the floor] See ya! [walks away, and the vacuum then sucks it up. SpongeBob is eating the chocolate bar]
",6
11653,SpongeBob,101," Thank you Patrick! [the vacuum says that it's on full capacity]
",6
11654,Squidward,101," Oh no! [Squidward's house explodes. Scene then cuts to the House Fancy background, then to Nick]
",6
11655,Nick,101," Hello, and welcome back to House Fancy. We're arriving at the home of Mr. Squidward Tentacles, who claims his house is far more fancier than that of Squilliam Fancyson. Let's take a look. [both are shocked because of Squidward's house] Well, I, I, I, well I don't know how to say this...
",6
11656,Squilliam,101," Go ahead, say it.
",6
11657,Nick,101," Squidward Tentacles, you seem to have ushered in an entire new era in house fanciness!
",6
11658,Squilliam,101," Huh?
",6
11659,Squidward,101," I have-... I have?
",6
11660,Nick,101," What you have done here hearkens back to the illustrious post-primitive movement popularized by famous designer Saul Limpkins. Say, was he a big inspiration for you?
",6
11661,Squidward,101," Why, yes. I've studied him for... years! [Squilliam gulps]
",6
11662,Nick,101," I would like to announce, that Squidward's house will be featured in an hour long, commercial free House Fancy special, and Squidward will be crowned House Fancy prince, of the year! In honor which, was originally to be bestowed on Squilliam, but now isn't. [Squilliam falls]
",6
11663,Squidward,101," Yay! [Squilliam starts crying]
",6
11664,SpongeBob,101," Oh, don't worry Squilliam, I might be able to get Squidward to help redecorate your house. He is a personal friend of mine. You know success hasn't gone to his head? He is still the same old great guy, he has not changed. [Squilliam cries harder]",6

11721,SpongeBob,102," [laughs] Shoe pockets. Oh, Mr. Krabs, that is just ridiculous.
",6
11722,Mr. Krabs,102," It is?
",6
11723,SpongeBob,102," Well, I do have a tie pocket though. [SpongeBob checks] No, not in there either.
",6
11724,Mr. Krabs,102," Hey, maybe it fell in your sock.
",6
11725,SpongeBob,102," Well, I...
",6
11726,Mr. Krabs,102," Did you check there? [holds SpongeBob upside down, and shakes him, SpongeBob's brain falls out] Uhh?
",6
11727,SpongeBob,102," Hey look, it's my brain! [brain grows legs and walks away] Hey where's it going? [brain falls though a crack] Ooh, there. [brain crawls on Squidward, and SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs follow it, they find it under a barrel] Aha! [brain squirts liquid at him, SpongeBob laughs] Not so fast, little guy. There now. Yes, I know. Come here. [brain crawls back into SpongeBob's head]
",6
11728,Mr. Krabs,102," Uhh?
",6
11729,SpongeBob,102," What's the matter Mr. Krabs? Didn't you know I was a brain whisperer?
",6
11730,Mr. Krabs,102," So, uhh, no penny, huh?
",6
11731,SpongeBob,102," Nope.
",6
11732,Mr. Krabs,102," Darn! [cuts to later when SpongeBob is mopping, and hears a noise]
",6
11733,Squidward,102," Me too.
",6
11734,SpongeBob,102," Do you think we should walk out back to investigate?
",6
11735,Squidward,102," Never. [SpongeBob and Squidward are now walking out back]
",6
11736,SpongeBob,102," The sounds are coming from back here. What the? [a movie theater is being built]
",6
11737,Mr. Krabs,102," Careful with those marquee ladders!
",6
11738,SpongeBob,102," Hey, Mr. Krabs, you made your own movie theater!
",6
11739,Mr. Krabs,102," Yes I did.
",6
11740,SpongeBob,102," Yay!
",6
11741,Mr. Krabs,102," And you're just in time for the grand opening! [pulls a lever that turns on the electricity on] Step right up folks, and witness a spell binding tale chock full of adventure, and action, and thrills... [Mr. Krabs is chirping like a dolphin as two fish walk up]
",6
11742,Frank,102," You know, I'm not really hungry.
",6
11743,Harold,102," Yeah, let's go see what this fat guy is yelling about.
",6
11744,Mr. Krabs,102," ...witness the terrifying challenges overcome by... by...
",6
11745,Harold,102," By who?
",6
11746,Mr. Krabs,102," by a... by a plucky young sponge.
",6
11747,SpongeBob,102," Just like me!
",6
11748,Squidward,102," Does a movie like that even exist?
",6
11749,Harold,102," Yeah, does it?!
",6
11750,Mr. Krabs,102," Uhh, well, actually I was going to show you this flip book and...
",6
11751,Squidward,102," A flip book?
",6
11752,Harold,102," Yeah, I don't even know what that IS! [everyone walks away]
",6
11753,Mr. Krabs,102," No, wait. Noooooooo!
",6
11754,SpongeBob,102," Mr. Krabs, can I see the movie now? Please?
",6
11755,Mr. Krabs,102," Of course you can lad! You just gotta give me one penny.
",6
11756,SpongeBob,102," But, but...
",6
11757,Mr. Krabs,102," But what?
",6
11758,SpongeBob,102," But, I really don't have a penny. [Mr. Krabs screams, and then demolishes the movie theater, cuts to night where SpongeBob is walking to the Krusty Krab] Huh, that's too bad. I really wanted to see that movie. Oh well. [Squidward is dressed like a waiter]
",6
11759,Squidward,102," Good evening, [SpongeBob whistles] and [Squidward looks at a piece of paper] welcome to the [looks at paper] Krusty Krab semi-annual charity night.
",6
11760,SpongeBob,102," Squidward? You look beautiful!
",6
11761,Squidward,102," Let me show you to your table.
",6
11762,SpongeBob,102," My table? Fancy. [gasps] My very own name tag! [lights turn off and Squidward sighs, as he shines a flash light on Mr. Krabs]
",6
11763,SpongeBob,102," Mr. Krabs.
",6
11764,Mr. Krabs,102," [cheered up] Yes?
",6
11765,SpongeBob,102," I would like to donate a penny.
",6
11766,Mr. Krabs,102," You would?
",6
11767,SpongeBob,102," If I only had one! [SpongeBob starts crying, Mr. Krabs' eyes go into his head, and he screams. The scene then cuts to SpongeBob's house, Mr. Krabs is using a flower delivery truck to spy on his house, he is speaking gibberish, he then notices SpongeBob walking out the door, he then walks in, with a metal detector, he then looks around]
",6
11768,Mr. Krabs,102," Hiding it, somewhere. Hiding it. Hiding it. Hiding it. Hiding it.
",6
11769,Gary,102," Meow.
",6
11770,Mr. Krabs,102," What's that? You! You know where!
",6
11771,Gary,102," Meow. [Mr. Krabs picks him up]
",6
11772,Mr. Krabs,102," Tell where!
",6
11773,Gary,102," Meow.
",6
11774,Mr. Krabs,102," Hiding it, inside, [reaches into Gary's shell] in there, somewhere. [lights come on, and SpongeBob walks in]
",6
11775,SpongeBob,102," [gasps] Mr. Krabs! What is this metal detector doing on the floor? These should only be stored on special racks. [gasps] And you're not wearing your metal detector handling gloves!
",6
11776,Mr. Krabs,102," SpongeBob, I just wanted that penny you found on the street yesterday. Oh, I'm sorry.
",6
11777,SpongeBob,102," Mr. Krabs, that wasn't a penny. [laughs]
",6
11778,Mr. Krabs,102," It wasn't?
",6
11779,SpongeBob,102," No, that was just a dried up piece of gum for my collection. I think it's peppermint.
",6
11780,Mr. Krabs,102," Ah ha ha ha ha hooooooooo hoo. I fell so relieved. There was no penny after all! Well, I'll be going now, You can keep the metal detector, SpongeBob. See ya!
",6
11781,SpongeBob,102," Thanks, Mr. Krabs. Hey, Gary, you can play with that. [Gary sniffs it, then spits on it, then walks away, the gum then absorbs it] Hey, this isn't gum at all. [pulls it out, revealing that it is a $500 bill] It's just a dumb old $500 bill. This won't go with my chewed up gum collection. Ah well, good night, Gary. 
",6
11782,Mr. Krabs,102," Penny, must have buried it around here somewhere. I'll just have to keep digging.",6

",6
11796,Mr. Krabs,103," Brace yourself! [Mr. Krabs hides under a table, and SpongeBob hides under a barrel, the wrecking ball then misses the Krusty Krab] Huh? [the wrecking ball then destroys the Chum Bucket] Plankton's destroying the Chum Bucket? Heh, heh, I guess he's finally given up on the restaurant business. Couldn't take the competition. [a bulldozer than drags a giant Coliseum to where the Chum Bucket was] What is that? [a giant monitor appears on top of the Coliseum, and Plankton is on it]
",6
11797,Plankton,103," Greetings, citizens of Bikini Bottom. Behold my imperial Chum Coliseum! [nobody is excited] I vow to introduce to this fair city, culture, in the form of hand to hand grappling! [still nobody is excited] I intend to enrich your lives culturally, by exhibiting the moist spectacle of gladiators in mortal conflict! [still no one is excited] My corporate underwriters told me to mention that it's free! [everyone is excited, and they run into the coliseum] Come one! Come all! Remember, kids love gladiators.

11798,Debbie,103," Wow, real-life conflict, for free!
",6
11799,Nathiel,103," Let the horror show begin! [everyone in the Krusty Krab runs to the coliseum]

",6
11801,Karen,103," Oh, yes, my resisters are simply gushing from their copper foil traces.
",6
11802,Plankton,103," This will prove to be my greatest evil scheme ever!
",6
11803,Karen,103," That's what you said when you tried to boil Krabs in a giant bisque
",6
11804,Plankton,103," I can still feel the burns, which is why I removed all molten liquid from this maneuver. And it's why this time, I will be the one with all the customers. And Krabs will be the pathetic one, in an empty restaurant, stuck with a computer for a wife. [Karen shuts down] Uh, sorry, honey.
",6
11805,SpongeBob,103," Wow, looks like Plankton finally has some customers!
",6
11806,Mr. Krabs,103," I agree, it's very suspicious. And he may have lured a few of our fair-weather customers in with some cheap entertainment, but our loyal customers, know quality when they taste it! So let's get in there, and serve 'em up a burger they tell their grand-guppies about! [they walk into the Krusty Krab, and it's empty] Where's all my loyal customers?

11807,Squidward,103," They've all taken their grand-guppies to see the guts and gore across the street.

[cuts to the coliseum where there is a sign that says ""GLADIATOR FIGHT 2-DAY!"", Mr. Krabs, SpongeBob, and Squidward sit down] This reeks of evil. And i'm going to sniff out the source. [Mr. Krabs sniffs, then Plankton appears]

11814,Scooter,103," All right!
",6
11815,SpongeBob,103," Yay! [Plankton releases a lionfish into the ring, everyone cheers again] Whoo! Isn't this a boat load of fun, Squidward? I can't wait to see the poor sucker who has to go against that beast!
",6
11816,Squidward,103," You call this fun? This is just cheap uncultured lay sport.
",6
11817,Plankton,103," Now, release the opponent.
",6
11818,SpongeBob,103," Yes! [Plankton releases Patrick into the ring, everyone cheers again. SpongeBob is horrified] Patrick? How could they? This is horrible! [cries]
",6
11819,Squidward,103," This is fabulous! [laughs]
",6
11820,Plankton,103," Enough dilly-dallying. Send out the blood sausages! [two muscular people put a necklace of sausages on Patrick]
",6
11821,Patrick,103," All right! [Patrick is about to eat a sausage, then the lionfish growls at him, Plankton laughs]
",6
11822,Plankton,103," That pink dimwit doesn't stand a chance with those sausages around his throat! As soon as the smell of sausage hits that ravenous lionfish's nostrils, he'll be all over Patrick like mold on a shower curtain!
",6
11823,Sally,103," Rip his sausages off!
",6
11824,Patrick,103," Ohh. Nice kitty. [notices sausages. He takes one off] Here, kitty. Want a sausage? A nice, delicious, tasty...... sausage. [takes a bite out of the sausage, the lion snatches it from him, and growls at him] Spawn of a gefilte fish! [runs from the lionfish]
",6
11825,SpongeBob,103," [Squidward is enjoying the show] I can't sit here and watch this! That's my best friend out there! [SpongeBob jumps into a chariot, dressed in knight attire and goes toward Patrick] Patrick!
",6
11826,Patrick,103," What? Oh, oh it's you. Hey, how's it going buddy?
",6
11827,SpongeBob,103," No time for chit chat, get in! [SpongeBob pulls Patrick in the chariot] Hurry up Nelly!

11828,Nat,103," Boo!

",6
11830,Mr. Krabs,103," Mom!
",6
11831,Plankton,103," This is ridiculous! I order a simple brutal mauling for my denizens, and I get a circus act! Time for phase 2! [cuts to Plankton with a Chum Stick] Chum on a stick! Get your fresh chum right here! Some chum for you miss?
",6
11832,Sadie,103," Well, all this waiting around for someone to get mauled is making me a bit hungry.
",6
11833,Plankton,103," Here, take this one. It's fresh and warm, like my hospitality.
",6
11834,Sadie,103," Why thank you.
",6
11835,Plankton,103," Just ten dollars please.
",6
11836,Sadie,103," Ten dollars? Why would I pay ten dollars, when I can go across the street and get a Krabby Patty for one dollar?
",6
11837,Mr. Krabs,103," Exactly!
",6
11838,Plankton,103," You don't get this kind of entertainment with a Krabby Patty, do you?
",6
11839,Sadie,103," No, I suppose not.
",6
11840,Plankton,103," Ten dollars, or the fight's off!
",6
11841,Sadie,103," Ah, fine, whatever.
",6
11842,Plankton,103," Here you are. I'm sure I've made a satisfied customer of you all ready.
",6
11843,Sadie,103," That was appalling! What was in that?
",6
11844,Plankton,103," Oh, just the usual ingredients. Some jellyfish squeezings, whale blubber, sea horse snout, and a sprinkle of anchor rust. [Sadie coughs and gags, then pukes in one of the rows of stadium seating]
",6
11845,Sadie,103," [her lower lip covered with a lot of spit] Oh barnacles. That's foul! [everyone tries to leave, but Plankton locks all the exits]
",6
11846,Plankton,103," Now, I've been waiting for 20 years to have the amount of customers Krabs sees everyday! And I won't let that be ruined because the show's ""boring"", or the food's ""inedible."" So sit down, enjoy the show and buy some chum! [everyone walks back to their seat with a chum stick, scene cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick]
",6
11847,SpongeBob,103," What do we do now Patrick?
",6
11848,Patrick,103," Don't worry, I'm all ready doing it. (Patrick is eating a sausage)
",6
11849,SpongeBob,103," NO! [slaps the sausage out of his hands] Patrick, now is not the time for eating, now is the time to avoid being eaten by that giant... Huh? [the lion eats the sausage that SpongeBob slapped out of Patrick's hand, then chases them again] That's it Patrick! He's not chasing us, he's chasing those tasty, tender, delicious, succulent sausages around your neck. [SpongeBob throws the sausages off of Patrick]
",6
11850,Plankton,103," Chum on a stick. Get your chum. [notices sausages] What the? [sausages land on Plankton] Oh great! Now how am I going to entertain the masses? [lion growls at him] Hey watch where you're... [notices the lion, and it growls at him again] Oh dear! [screams, then the lion growls at him, Plankton then runs out of a tiny door] Phew. Good thing I thought ahead, with that escape door. Try and catch me now, you prissy feline! [laughs, then the lion busts a hole, allowing him to get out, Plankton then screams, because he's chasing him] NO! Nice kitty. Want some chum? [he whimpers. cuts to the Krusty Krab, where all the customers are returned again]
",6
11851,Mr. Krabs,103," You know I'm not one to give out comments likely, I've gotta hand it to you boy, [referring to SpongeBob] if you didn't throw those sausages into the audience, we would have been dead meat!
",6
11852,SpongeBob,103," My pleasure captain!
",6
11853,Patrick,103," Yeah, thanks buddy! You really saved my behind! No joke! [shows that there's a hole in his pants, revealing his butt from the fight]
",6
11854,Mr. Krabs,103," I think that it's safe to say, that no matter how diabolical Plankton's plans may be, he'll never have the loyalty, of me good customers.
",6
11855,Scooter,103," One Krabby Patty, please.
",6
11856,Mr. Krabs,103," But of course, my good customer. That'll be ten dollars.
",6
11857,Scooter,103," Ten dollars? What happened to one dollar?
",6
11858,Mr. Krabs,103," Ahem, perhaps you'd like to speak to our financial expert. [""financial expert"" is the lion that was chasing Plankton, Scooter is scared, and gives Mr. Krabs ten dollars]
",6
11859,Scooter,103," [muttering] Stupid inflation.
",6
11860,Mr. Krabs,103," Thanks for your business. [everyone laughs, they then stop and walk away, the lion then growls, and the episode ends]",6

11907,Squidward,104," [slaps himself. Cuts to next day at the Krusty Krab where Squidward walks into the kitchen and greets SpongeBob] Hi, SpongeBob.
",6
11908,SpongeBob,104," Hi, how are ya.
",6
11909,Squidward,104," Good, just coming by to get a drink.
",6
11910,SpongeBob,104," Wonderful weather we're having.
",6
11911,Squidward,104," It sure is.
",6
11912,SpongeBob,104," Ok, see ya 'round.
",6
11913,Squidward,104," Yeah... [chuckles] See ya. [chuckles] Oh, my. [slurps] I could get used to this.
",6
11914,Narrator,104," Three weeks later...
",6
11915,Squidward,104," There you are, sir. [watch beeps] Oh, yes it's time again. I've been meaning to say this but I've come to appreciate your demeanor lately.
",6
11916,SpongeBob,104," You know it's a funny thing, Squidward. I smoothed out the edges of my personality and the rest just followed suit. Now I am utterly normal. [he smiles showing his teeth with no buck tooth.Cuts to a customer biting into his flat Krabby Patty but all he is eating is paper. He takes it out of his mouth]
",6
11917,Customer #2,104," Ugh, that ain't right. I will never spend money here again.
",6
11918,Mr. Krabs,104," Never?
",6
11919,Customer #3,104," Come on, guys, these patties ain't worth the paper they're printed on.
",6
11920,Mr. Krabs,104," Wait, where're you going? [paper Krabby Patty lands on his nose] SpongeBob! What are you doing back here? Do you expect the customers to eat this? And now, thanks to you, they're leaving in boat loads. [customers are row out of the restaurant in boats]
",6
11921,SpongeBob,104," Maybe this thing is out of ink.
",6
11922,Mr. Krabs,104," [sighs] No, boy, you're missing the point. You can't make Krabby Patties with ink and paper. You gotta put your heart in it, boy. Now get back to making them patties the right way and stop acting so dull.
",6
11923,SpongeBob,104," What you call dull I call normal.
",6
11924,Mr. Krabs,104," Well, till you decide to start making them patties the way only you can I want you out of my place!
",6
11925,SpongeBob,104," [walks out of the Krusty Krab] I guess the decision to be normal was more life changing than I thought. [walks up to Patrick who is reading a paper at the bus stop] Hi, how are ya.
",6
11926,Patrick,104," What happened to you?
",6
11927,SpongeBob,104," Oh, I got normal.
",6
11928,Patrick,104," Whatever that means. Hey, SpongeBob, what do you say we charge into Jellyfish Fields nets a-blaze? [takes two jellyfish nets out of his pockets]
",6
11929,SpongeBob,104," Let's do something normal, like window shopping.
",6
11930,Patrick,104," Let's do this... [groans as he shrinks his head inside of his body and makes it reappear out of the side of his stomach] Ya-ha! Hey, your turn.
",6
11931,SpongeBob,104," I think I'll pass. But I do need to defragment my hard drive, would you like to help?
",6
11932,Patrick,104," Hey, listen...when you decide to do something fun you know where to find me. [walks away with head still out of stomach]
",6
11933,SpongeBob,104," Ok, see ya 'round. [rings Squidward's door bell] Hi, how are ya.
",6
11934,Squidward,104," I never thought I'd hear myself say this but please come in, SpongeBob. [Squidward pours tea into SpongeBob's cup]
",6
11935,SpongeBob,104," Thank you. Tell me, what are you doing cooped up in here when the weather outside is so normal.
",6
11936,Squidward,104," Well, today is dusting day. The day I dust my 483 self-portraits.
",6
11937,SpongeBob,104," Wow, that's something you don't see in the average house.
",6
11938,Squidward,104," You know, SpongeBob, it's OK to be a little different. [slurps his tea]
",6
11939,SpongeBob,104," And you know what else is abnormal? Your nose—it's all bulbous and flappy. Your eyes are a little odd, too. Looks like your whole face could use some work. Yeah, there we go. [SpongeBob turns Squidward's face into a real live Squidward face] See? Looking normal already.
",6
11940,Squidward,104," What the...?
",6
11941,SpongeBob,104," One more thing, Squidward. You don't wear pants. [Squidward kicks him out of his house]
",6
11942,Squidward,104," And stay out of my home! [slams the door then looks in the mirror and pokes his nose a little]
",6
11943,SpongeBob,104," Oh, what happened? I lost my job and my best friend and now I'm too normal for Squidward. Maybe I have taken this normal thing too far. No problem, SpongeBob. You made yourself normal. Now all you have to do is reweird yourself. All it'll take is a mental adjustment and some tight clenching. Now focus... [groans] and clench. [groans so much his eyes pop out] Oh, well, if I'm going to get weird, I'm going to need to see a professional. [Cuts to Patrick's house]
",6
11944,Patrick,104," [tongue is twisted around] Look at my tongue. [tongue un-twists itself and Patrick laughs]
",6
11945,SpongeBob,104," That's very nice, Patrick, but I need you to retrain me. I want to be abnormal again.
",6
11946,Patrick,104," Huh, I don't think you have what it takes.
",6
11947,SpongeBob,104," Please, Patrick. If anyone can teach me the arcane art of the weird, it's you. Teach me how to be me, again.
",6
11948,Patrick,104," It won't be easy but I'll do it.
",6
11949,SpongeBob,104," Oh, thank you, Patrick!
",6
11950,Patrick,104," But first, I'll need a garden hose and a flatbed truck and I'll need you to remove your trousers. [Cuts to people laughing at SpongeBob who is only in his underwear]
",6
11951,SpongeBob,104," Patrick, I'm feeling very self-conscious right now.
",6
11952,Patrick,104," [spraying water] Try to concentrate on your first lesson in weird. [throws SpongeBob onto the streak of water] See you on the other side, buddy! [SpongeBob grunts as both Patrick and SpongeBob are sliding on a water trail that lead to a ramp on a flatbed truck that launches them into the Bikini Bottom Zoo]
",6
11953,Susie,104," Mommy, mommy... what are those things?
",6
11954,Shubie,104," Those are undesirables, honey. We only talk to normal people! [Shubie and her two kids walk off]
",6
11955,Patrick,104," SpongeBob, the weird therapy is working. Your craters are coming back. We just have to keep pushing the boundaries. We've gotta get stranger. [Cuts to Jellyfish Fields where SpongeBob is riding on Patrick's back like a horse and catches a jellyfish in the net. Another crater comes back. Cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick licking the sand and as SpongeBob is licking, his nose grows back to normal size. Cuts to Patrick and SpongeBob standing on their hands] Talk backwards.
",6
11956,SpongeBob,104," Tap erus uoy era? [SpongeBob's legs and arms are back to normal. Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick eating secret Krabby Sauce with their feet. SpongeBob's teeth appear. But then something is happening to SpongeBob]
",6
11957,Patrick,104," What's happening? The final transformation. [SpongeBob transforms back into his normal state]
",6
11958,SpongeBob,104," Huh?
",6
11959,Patrick,104," What happened?
",6
11960,SpongeBob,104," I don't know. I guess I became permanently normal.
",6
11961,Patrick,104," No!!
",6
11962,SpongeBob,104," [crying] I don't wanna be normal. [knock on door].
",6
11963,Patrick,104," Go away.
",6
11964,SpongeBob,104," Normal is not worth it.
",6
11965,Patrick,104," We're in mourning.
",6
11966,Squidward,104," [Patrick's rock begins to open] It's me, Squidward. I'm looking for SpongeBob. [Squidward is in a normal state] Hi, how are ya? [SpongeBob is so scared and shocked at how Squidward looks that he screams himself back into his regular self]
",6
11967,Patrick,104," SpongeBob, you're back to your square shape.
",6
11968,SpongeBob,104," Wow, I guess Squidward's normal looks scared me back to my original form. Thanks, buddy, you saved my life.
",6
11969,Squidward,104," Wonderful weather we're having, hm?
",6
11970,SpongeBob,104," It sure is, buddy. It sure is. [SpongeBob and Patrick laugh whilst the episode ends]",6

",6
11980,Mr. Krabs,105," [laughs] I suppose you can have the honor today, lad.
",6
11981,Squidward,105," [counting money] 37... 38... [SpongeBob steps on Squidward's face causing it to get stuck in the register, takes a key, opens up his pants, pulls out out a container, opens it, pulls off the plastic wrap, revealing lettuce, tomatoes, and cheese]
",6
11982,SpongeBob,105," Freshness, check. Buns, check. [throws the buns on the table with his butt] Fresh patties. [throws spatula into the freezer. It spins around and takes a stack of patties back to him] Check. [flips the patties on the table] Oh, silly me, I'm forgetting one more minor detail. [squeezes his hat out of his head] Oh, yeah. Is it getting hot in here? [laughs] Or is it just you? [points to the grill. His eyelashes burn off] Ah! [takes an order off the line and reads it] ""Two Krabby Patties. P.S., SpongeBob, you're an idiot. Love, Squidward."" Aw, love you, too, Squiddy. Two Krabby Patties, coming right up! [twirls Spat] Whoa! [it gets stuck on the ceiling. He tries jumping for it] Hmm. [cuts to a scene where a pile of stuff is stacked up to the ceiling. He tries to reach it, but it is unsuccessful. Suddenly, some jars of tartar sauce from the pile break causing swords and scissors to fall. Meanwhile, SpongeBob goes up to the ceiling and reaches for Spat. He takes it off by putting his hands on his hips but he doesn't know it] Whew, this thing is stuck pretty good. [puts it back in. He gets it out of the ceiling but then he accidentally falls and is about to land the swords and scissors] Whoa! [screams] I guess this is it. [he is saved by Spat, who gets stuck on a single sword. It slides off the sword and SpongeBob gets on the ground safely] Oh, you really saved me! [slips on some tartar sauce, which results in his finger getting run down on a splinter in slow-motion] Whooooaaaa! Hey, a splinter. Okay, well, it's been nice knowing you but you have got to go. Now. Okay, out we go. [he cannot take it off] Oh, that kinda hurts. Come on. Ooh, that really hurts. Oh, barnacles, this hurts! Conch-shelled manatees, this is painful! [tries to use Spat to take it off but fails] [ screams and pants] Okay, you're tough, you're smart, and you're charming, but you are still no match for me! Look! A bald eagle with a mustache! [tries to pull it off with his teeth, but his face skin rips off revealing his skeleton] Okay, fine, stay. But I hope you like making Krabby Patties.
",6
11983,Nat,105," [talking to Squidward] Excuse me, sir, but, um, I ordered a couple Krabby Patties a while ago, and I'm wondering when they'll be out.
",6
11984,Squidward,105," [""crushes"" Nat's face with his tentacle and laughs] Looks like I'm crushing your face. [laughs]
",6
11985,Peterson,105," So, will they be ready soon?
",6
11986,Squidward,105," Yeah, yeah, yeah. Don't move too much, it ruins it.
",6
11987,SpongeBob,105," [gets a crumpled note thrown at him. He tries to hold Spat, but the splinter prevents him] Ow. Ow. Ow. You're making this a little bit difficult. Luckily, I am ambidextrous! [presses a button on Spat. A string comes out, and he ties the spatula to his nose. He puts two spatulas on the grill using his spatula and flips them, then he picks up one of the cheese, tomatoes, and lettuce with his three good fingers. He throws them up in the air and holds up a plate with a patty on a bun on it and the cheese, tomato, and lettuce fall on it. He puts the other bun on top with his pinky] Perfection! [puts the Krabby Patties on the window desk and dings the serving bell four times. Before he can ring it a fifth time, Squidward puts his hand on it]
",6
11988,Squidward,105," I hear you! I hear you!
",6
11989,SpongeBob,105," [faces Squidward, causing his spatula to go in his eyes] Okay, good, 'cause these two Krabby Patties are ready!
",6
11990,Squidward,105," [growls and goes in the kitchen] SpongeBob?
",6
11991,SpongeBob,105," Yes?
",6
11992,Squidward,105," Can I ask you something?
",6
11993,SpongeBob,105," Yes.
",6
11994,Squidward,105," [smiling with a calm, relaxed voice] What's that? [pointing to the spatula tied to SpongeBob's nose]
",6
11995,SpongeBob,105," What's what?
",6
11996,Squidward,105," You know. [flicks the spatula]
",6
11997,SpongeBob,105," Know what?
",6
11998,Squidward,105," This.
",6
11999,SpongeBob,105," What?
",6
12000,Squidward,105," This thing here.
",6
12001,SpongeBob,105," What thing where?
",6
12002,Squidward,105," The spatula [shouting] tied to your nose!
",6
12003,SpongeBob,105," [laughs] This! Well, you see, this got stuck up there [points to the ceiling but hits Squidward in the nose] so I stacked stuff and I climbed up to reach it. I reached the grip [holds out his hand but pushes Squidward to the ground] and I got it but then I fell and I screamed! I was sure I was dead but then I wasn't but then I tripped and I got this splinter... Squidward? Squidward, were you listening at all? [shows Squidward the splinter] I got this really bad splinter, you see? [some pus falls from the splinter into Squidward's left eye] And I couldn't hold the spatula with my hand so I used my nose. [Squidward gets up] Makes sense now, huh?
",6
12004,Squidward,105," [sarcastically] Oh, yeah, that makes perfect sense. You're a half-wit who injured himself at work being a nitwit. [growls and walks away]
",6
12005,SpongeBob,105," [laughs] Good one, Squiddy.
",6
12006,Squidward,105," [grumbles] Injury. Your brain is injured! [stops and gets an idea] Wait a minute. Did you say that you got that splinter injury at work?
",6
12007,SpongeBob,105," Yeah.
",6
12008,Squidward,105," Oh, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk. That's not good.
",6
12009,SpongeBob,105," I know, it hurts so bad.
",6
12010,Squidward,105," Yeah, when Mr. Krabs finds out, oh, man.
",6
12011,SpongeBob,105," Finds out what?
",6
12012,Squidward,105," Finds out about this injury.
",6
12013,SpongeBob,105," You mean my splinter?
",6
12014,Squidward,105," He'll be forced to send you home.
",6
12015,SpongeBob,105," H-h-h-h-home? But I'm fine!
",6
12016,Squidward,105," Here, let me take this for you. [takes SpongeBob's hat and spatula]
",6
12017,SpongeBob,105," Why? Hey, wait, I'm fine!
",6
12018,Squidward,105," It was a good shift while it lasted. [walks into the bathroom. SpongeBob follows him]
",6
12019,SpongeBob,105," While it lasted? What are you doing? [both of them walk into a stall. Squidward flushes his hat and spatula down the toilet.] W... What are you...?
",6
12020,Squidward,105," I know it's hard to say goodbye.
",6
12021,SpongeBob,105," But, but, but, Squidward, I'm fine! [starts tap dancing] I'm fine! I'm OK! Look at me, nothing's wrong! See? See? [takes some toilet paper and wraps it around his splinter] See? See?
",6
12022,Squidward,105," Oh, I believe you, SpongeBob, but, unfortunately, [the toilet paper falls off] the rules clearly state that you must be sent home.
",6
12023,SpongeBob,105," No, anything but that. [goes onto Squidward] Please, Squidward, you can't let this happen! [cries] You can't let them force me away!
",6
12024,Squidward,105," Sorry, the rules are the rules. [SpongeBob continues crying as he clings onto Squidward, who goes into the kitchen] Yeah, it'll be pretty quiet around here with Mr. Krabs sending you home early and all. I just hope we'll make it through the whole rest of this day without you here. [smiles. SpongeBob takes deep breaths so hard that he blows air in his face]
",6
12025,SpongeBob,105," Please, Squidward! Don't tell Mr. Krabs!
",6
12026,Squidward,105," What? Me? Tell Mr. Krabs? Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No.
",6
12027,SpongeBob,105," Wew.
",6
12028,Squidward,105," Well, maybe.
",6
12029,SpongeBob,105," [screams and holds his heart emitting from his chest]
",6
12030,Squidward,105," I don't have to tell Mr. Krabs. [SpongeBob is relieved. Squidward leans close to his ear] Because he already knows. [SpongeBob's eyes open wide and his nose droops. Squidward grabs two pillows and places them over his ears, then SpongeBob screams so loudly that the sound waves blow Squidward out the front door, and he comes back in through the back door]
",6
12031,SpongeBob,105," He does?
",6
12032,Squidward,105," Oh, yeah. Mr. Krabs has preturnatural instincts when it comes to situations like this. It's almost as if when something's amiss in his restaurant... [leans close to SpongeBob] ...he can smell it.
",6
12033,Mr. Krabs,105," These quarters smell sad. You're not planning on getting a refill with them, are ya?!
",6
12034,Frankie,105," No, I wasn't. [slurps his drink and throws it on the ground and exits]
",6
12035,SpongeBob,105," [gasps] You're right, Squidward. I need help! [scene cuts to SpongeBob dialing a phone number] Please pick up, please pick up, please pick up. [Patrick answers but doesn't say anything. SpongeBob taps his foot while waiting] Patrick?
",6
12036,Patrick,105," Yeah?
",6
12037,SpongeBob,105," [sighs] Thank goodness you're there. I got a splinter on my thumb and...
",6
12038,Patrick,105," Mm-hmm. I see. Well, I'm pretty booked today, but I think I can fit you in.
",6
12039,SpongeBob,105," [opens the back door and sees Patrick sitting in the dumpster with the phone] Thanks, Patrick.
",6
12040,Patrick,105," No problem. [hangs up. He goes into the garbage and comes back up wearing a doctor outfit]
",6
12041,Patrick,105," [putting on gloves] You called the right person, Mr. SpongeBob. [grunts] Now, let's see where the problem's at. [grabs SpongeBob's leg and inspects it] Hmmm... interesting. [sniffs his leg]
",6
12042,SpongeBob,105," Uh, Patrick...
",6
12043,Patrick,105," [puts SpongeBob's foot in his mouth] Hmmm... interesting.
",6
12044,SpongeBob,105," Patrick? [Patrick licks SpongeBob's foot then gurgles and swishes it around like mouthwash]
",6
12045,SpongeBob,105," Patrick, this isn't helping!
",6
12046,Patrick,105," Oh, I'm sorry. [pulls SpongeBob's foot out of his mouth] I didn't realize you were a doctor. Hmph!
",6
12047,SpongeBob,105," I'm not!
",6
12048,Patrick,105," Oh, but I'm sure you can figure it out with your 12 years of med school.
",6
12049,SpongeBob,105," Patrick, you didn't go to med school.
",6
12050,Patrick,105," So?
",6
12051,SpongeBob,105," Patrick, I'm sorry. I really need your help.
",6
12052,Patrick,105," Oh, no, no, it looks like you have things under control.
",6
12053,SpongeBob,105," Please, Patrick! I don't want to go home early! [cries]
",6
12054,Patrick,105," Okay. But we play by my rules, SquareBob. [SpongeBob smiles and nods. Patrick inspects SpongeBob's splinter with a magnifying glass] Well, here's your problem. Don't you worry, buddy. [takes out a huge wooden spike and a hammer] We're gonna make it go away.
",6
12055,SpongeBob,105," Phew, thanks, Patrick, you're a lifesaver. [Patrick places the spike on top of the splinter and lines up the hammer, then he slams the splinter further into SpongeBob's thumb] Ow! [his thumb swells up horrifically and grows ten times in size. Patrick is looking down at it. It reaches up to his face]
",6
12056,Patrick,105," There appears to be a little bit of swelling. [Patrick picks up a lump of trash] This garbage compress should help that go down. [Patrick drops the garbage on the swollen thumb. The garbage slides off of it and the area where the splinter is inserted fizzes a sickly green ooze and turns SpongeBob's thumb a dark purple] That doesn't look good. [Patrick's watch beeps] Yeah, but my shift is over. [takes off the outfit and puts his hat on] Call me in the morning... if you can still dial the phone. [walks away. SpongeBob walks back inside]
",6
12057,SpongeBob,105," Ah. [Mr. Krabs and Squidward are there. He gasps]
",6
12058,Mr. Krabs,105," What's that?
",6
12059,SpongeBob,105," What's what?
",6
12060,Mr. Krabs,105," Behind your back?
",6
12061,SpongeBob,105," You mean this? [pulls his splinter out from behind his back, but it is covered by his hat]
",6
12062,Mr. Krabs,105," Put your hat on, boy! Show some company pride!
",6
12063,SpongeBob,105," [puts his hat on] Heh, company pride, of course.
",6
12064,Mr. Krabs,105," Uh, SpongeBob?
",6
12065,SpongeBob,105," Yes?
",6
12066,Mr. Krabs,105," Have you always had three legs?
",6
12067,SpongeBob,105," [SpongeBob has a sock and shoe covering his splintered thumb] Yes.
",6
12068,Mr. Krabs,105," [believing him] Interesting... Well, what's this about a splinter that Squidward's been telling me all about? [SpongeBob screams] All right, boy, let's see it. [SpongeBob whimpers] Come on, SpongeBob, it's just a little splinter. I mean, how bad could it...? [SpongeBob reveals his massive, swollen thumb which has a slight area of pale green fizz around the impaled center. His thumb is now red. Mr. Krabs gags] Oh, merciful Neptune! [Squidward moans and faints] Okay, no problem. No problem. [easily picks out the splinter. There is a brief pause and the tip of SpongeBob's thumb pops and shoots out confetti] Problem sol... [green pus shoots out of SpongeBob's thumb onto Mr. Krabs' face. He takes out an umbrella as it dies down. There is a close-up of SpongeBob's free hand, bending his splinter-free thumb] Whew. For a second there, I thought I was gonna have to pay you workman's ""compersation.""
",6
12069,SpongeBob,105," What's worker's compensation?
",6
12070,Mr. Krabs,105," You know, when you get paid for sitting at home.
",6
12071,Squidward,105," [his eyes shoot open. He gets up] You mean I can get paid while I'm at home?
",6
12072,Mr. Krabs,105," Yeah, what do ya think ""compersation"" stands for?
",6
12073,Squidward,105," [gets the cash register out of the boat counter and slowly smashes it onto his head two times] Ow!
",6

12075,Squidward,105," [smashes the cash register on his head another two times then throws the cash register up into the air and gets crushed by it] Can I get my ""compersation"" now?

12085,Evelyn,106," He's amazing!
",6
12086,Frank,106," I'll say! [Larry then throws a basketball into the hoop, then is about to fall, but he presses a button to cause a sky glider to come out, and he causes the flag on some children's sand castles to catch on fire]
",6
12087,Kids,106," Woah! [the sky glider then comes off, and Larry stops. Everyone cheers, then Larry takes off his helmet]

",6
12093,Larry,106," And you can't... Uh... You can't... [Hears SpongeBob and Patrick whimpering, then picks them up] And you can't live like these two. Just look at 'em. Spineless, [Larry shakes them] weak, [touches them, and they fall] afraid of their own shadows. [They see their shadows, scream, and whimper] Pathetic!
",6
12094,Nat,106," Larry, how can they redeem their worthless lives?
",6
12095,Patrick,106," How do we do that?

",6
12101,Patrick,106," Living like Larry. Living like Larry. [cuts to later when SpongeBob and Patrick are blowing bubbles. Patrick is sighing, which is like blowing the bubbles] This is bogus!
",6
12102,SpongeBob,106," What's that Pat?
",6
12103,Patrick,106," SpongeBob, these are the best years of our lives, and you want to waste them blowing bubbles? We should be living in the moment! We should be living like Lar... [hears sea horses neighing] This is it SpongeBob! This is where we redeem are miserable lives! It's time to start... [jumps in the air, then stops] ...LIVIN' LIKE LARRY! [he then goes back down, and onto the back of a sea horse, and he then rides around] Hey, SpongeBob! SpongeBob? [SpongeBob is on a kiddie ride outside a grocery store]
",6
12104,SpongeBob,106," I'm living like Larry! Whoo-hoo! [cuts to later at SpongeBob's house. Patrick kicks the door down, and he is all bandaged up]

",6
12114,Patrick,106," Just you wait! it's the ultimate! [they run onto a giant ramp that leads into a trench] What do you think? And wait 'till you see the best part! [stomps on the ramp] Hey you guys. [lots of monsters are in the trench. growling and snapping..]
",6
12115,SpongeBob,106," I don't know Patrick, this looks very danger... [Patrick attaches a skate board on SpongeBob's back, then does so with him]
",6
12116,Patrick,106," Here's to living like Larry!
",6
12117,SpongeBob,106," Well, wait a minute Patrick, I think your missing the point. ""Living like Larry"" doesn't mean throwing caution to the wind, and risking everything on a stunt that will cost you your life.
",6
12118,Patrick,106," Don't you mean, cost us our lives SpongeBob?
",6
12119,SpongeBob,106," No Patrick, I mean your life. I'm not going.

",6
12121,SpongeBob,106," Mmm-hmm.
",6
12122,SpongeBob,106," I wonder how Patrick's doing with his ""living like Larry"" thing.
",6
12123,Patrick,106," SpongeBob! [SpongeBob looks out the window] SpongeBob! [Patrick is being chased by tough fish on motorcycles. He then runs into the Krusty Krab] You were right SpongeBob! I went too far! I went too far!
",6
12124,SpongeBob,106," Oh it's okay buddy, I think you learned your lesson. Hmm?
",6
12125,Patrick,106," Uh-uh.
",6
12126,SpongeBob,106," Now you just let me handle those guys out there. [SpongeBob walks outside] Gentlemen, Gentlemen.
",6
12127,All,106," What the?
",6
12128,SpongeBob,106," I know that you might be angry at my friend for his shenanigans, but you are not the only victim. His reckless thrill chasing has made him a hollow shell of his former self. Just look [scene reveals Patrick is a shell] So let me assure you, his days of ""living in the moment"" are over. Can you not forgive him for what ever he did? [they thin]
",6
12129,Tough Guy 2,106," Sure pal. Sure. [Shakes Patrick's hand]
",6
12130,SpongeBob,106," By the way, what did he do that made you all so cranky? [SpongeBob leans on there motorcycles, and they fall]
",6
12131,Tough Guy 2,106," He knocked over our motorcycles! [SpongeBob laughs nervously, then they chase SpongeBob and Patrick]
",6
12132,SpongeBob,106," So scared! Adrenalin pumping! [getting excited] Spine tingling! Endorphins rushing! I've never felt so alive! Oh, yeah baby, yeah! This is what Patrick was talking about! This is really living in the moment! Woo-yeah! This is life! Woo, woo, yeah, woo! [gets knocked in the air by a motor cycle] Now I am finally living like Larry! [cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick on top of ballast]
",6
12133,Patrick,106," Are you sure about this SpongeBob?
",6
12134,SpongeBob,106," Oh come on Patrick, what happened to being in the moment?
",6
12135,Patrick,106," I don't know SpongeBob, this looks pretty dangerous.
",6
12136,SpongeBob,106," [Immediately slaps Patrick in the back] Yeah, yeah, you said it buddy! Now we're really living like Larry! [Larry notices them on the ballast]
",6
12137,Larry,106," Well, would you look at that. Now there's two guys who know how to live!
",6
12138,SpongeBob,106," Prepare for countdown!
",6
12139,Larry,106," I'm proud of them. [takes a closer look] Wait a minute, with that angle of trajectory, they'll land right in...Rippers Reef! They'll be ripped to shreds! [runs over with a life preserver with rope tied to it] Wait, don't do it! Stop!
",6
12140,SpongeBob,106," 3-2-1 Lift off. [pulls a rope, which causes the arrow to set off]
",6
12141,Larry,106," Drat! [uses the life preserver to catch on to the arrow]
",6
12142,SpongeBob,106," Whooooo!!! Whoohooooo!!! Whoowoowoo!!! [life preserver catches arrow]
",6
12143,Larry,106," Whoooooa!!! [climbs rope] Look, guys, my advice wasn't meant to be taken literally! I meant to live life to the fullest, not to maim yourselves! Look! [then notice the reef]
",6
12144,Patrick,106," Uh oh!
",6
12145,Larry,106," AAAAAHHHHHH!!!! [Shows Rippers Reef then flips back to happy SpongeBob and screaming Larry] AAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!! [they crash into it, then cuts to scene of them in the hospital]
",6
12146,SpongeBob,106," What are you two lazy bones doing lying around? There's a really cool ramp down the hall, I've got room for two more. (Looks crazy in eyes) What would Larry do?
",6
12147,Larry,106, [angry] What would Larry do? I'll show you what Larry would do! [chases SpongeBob] Come here! Come here I said! Hey! [Chases him off the screen and episode ends],6

12154,Squidward,107," [is asleep in bed when his alarm wakes him up. He puts on his slippers, gets out of bed, walks to the mirror, pulls up his shirt by his collar, licks his finger, and rubs his eyebrows] Squidward, my man, you are perfect! [Squidward is walking outside with a watering can to water his kelp garden, but it's wilted] Oh no, my kelp garden is all wilted! Don't worry fellas, I've got just the thing to perk you up, kelp grow. Hold still. [Squidward sprays it, and his kelp stands up. Squidward sniffs it, then notices Patrick inside]

12195,Patrick,107," Get ready.
",6
12196,SpongeBob,107," Now, Patrick! [Patrick sucks him into his belly button, then spits him out. He then sprays Mr. Krabs's penny, and it turns bigger, and crushes Mr. Krabs] There you go Mr. Krabs. You always wanted to make ""big money"". [cuts to scene of live people groaning. Now talking to Patrick] Good deed accomplished! I ask for no reward.

12197,Patrick,107," You're a saint, SpongeBob! A saint!
",6
12198,SpongeBob,107," I know, and it is a burden I must carry. But times a wasting! We need another good deed!

",6
12200,SpongeBob,107," Um, right, that thing that we did that day.
",6
12201,Patrick,107," No, the other one. [both think, then Squidward walks on screen]

12202,Squidward,107," SpongeBob! [pants] Hey! Look at what you did to me. You better fix my nose, or you'll hear from my lawyer!

",6
12206,SpongeBob,107," Hmm, how to fix his nose?
",6
12207,Patrick,107," What, if you turn the bottle upside down, maybe it'll shrink it.
",6
12208,SpongeBob,107," Patrick, that's brilliant!!
",6
12209,Squidward,107," No wait, don't. [they spray his nose with the bottle upside down, and it gets bigger]
",6
12210,SpongeBob,107," That didn't work.
",6
12211,Patrick,107," Try it again.
",6
12212,SpongeBob,107," I think I'll just even him out. First, a bigger head.
",6
12213,Patrick,107," Well, now his body is too small.
",6
12214,SpongeBob,107," Right, too small. [SpongeBob sprays it]
",6
12215,Patrick,107," Arms are too short. [SpongeBob sprays his arm] Legs are too short. [SpongeBob sprays Squidward's legs] Other arm. [SpongeBob sprays Squidward's other arm] Feet too small. [SpongeBob sprays Squidward's feet] Teeth! [SpongeBob sprays them] Belly button. [SpongeBob sprays it. Patrick blows a kiss] Perfect!

12222,SpongeBob,107," And a giant.
",6
12223,SpongeBob & Patrick,107," A giant monster!
",6
12224,Squidward,107," I don't want to be a giant lumbering monster! [picks up SpongeBob and Patrick] What will I do now?

12225,SpongeBob,107," That's easy, play giant lumbering monster tag!
",6
12226,Patrick,107," Yeah! Yeah! You chase us!

12229,SpongeBob,107," [screams] This is really fun.
",6
12230,Patrick,107," [screams] I know. We should do this... [screams] ...more often. [they run into Bikini Bottom, screaming, when Squidward is chasing them]
",6
12231,Nancy,107," [screams] A monster! [grabs Monroe's arm and begins tugging it twice as if to start a segway, and runs away, riding Monroe like a segway]

12233,Medieval Fish,107," Monster! [As the humanized fish walks out, villagers with torches and weapons form a mob to run for Bikini Bottom. They run past Squidward to kill him.]
",6
12234,Male Fish,107," Huh? [takes out a torch from his case, then chases Squidward. Squidward finally gets SpongeBob and Patrick]
",6
12235,SpongeBob,107," You are very good at pretending Squidward. Look how you're all sweaty and angry, and you got the whole town to play along. [Citizens with torches and pitchforks and rakes form a mob, surrounding Squidward.]
",6
12236,Squidward,107," What the?
",6
12237,Miss Shell,107," Kick him!
",6
12238,Canadian Fish,107," Let's get him and make back bacon!
",6
12239,Lifeguard,107," Scoop out his... eyeballs and use 'em as... giant... misshapen soccer balls!
",6
12240,Taylor,107," Wait. Maybe he's a nice monster, like in my story book. [Tina and Sadie's torches extinguish.]
",6
12241,Lifeguard,107," Oh right, I, I haven't thought of that. Well, are you?
",6
12242,SpongeBob,107," Oh, goodness gracious yes. Squidward is the nicest giant of them all.
",6
12243,Patrick,107," Yeah! Squidward, tell them about all those times that you didn't punch me in the face.
",6
12244,SpongeBob,107," Even though you really wanted to.
",6
12245,Squidward,107," OH, QUIET YOU MORONS!!!!!!!!!
",6
12246,Nazz,107," He hurt the little one's feelings.
",6
12247,Shubie,107," Why, that's not very nice at all.
",6
12248,Lifeguard yells,107," Take him down boys! [Following the lifeguard fish, the mob uses a giant rake slingshot to hit his foot.]
",6
12249,Squidward,107," Ow! [holds his foot and hops backwards. Harold, Scooter, Nazz, and Fred set up a giant rake behind him. Squidward steps on it and falls down after it hits him on the back of the head. The lifeguard comes up with a big tube of lipstick.]
",6
12250,Lifeguard,107," This oughta fix him. [puts lipstick on Squidward's lips]
",6
12251,Squidward,107," Okay, okay, I'm nice. [is shown to be tied to the ground with ropes] Now will you leave me alone?
",6
12252,Sadie,107," Oh yeah? Then prove it! 
",6
12253,Lifeguard,107," Yeah! Are you nice enough to... um...
",6
12254,Nazz,107," Compliment me on my new hairdo?
",6
12255,Squidward,107," [sits up, breaking free from the ropes] Yeah, sure, whatever.
",6
12256,Nazz,107," [laughs] Oh, thank you.

12257,Camp Councilor,107," Let the junior guppies camp out under your toenails? [we see fish sleeping under Squidward's toenails]

12258,Skier,107," Take me to the top of Mount Humongous? [Squidward does it and the skier skis down Mt. Humongous] Whee...!

12267,All,107," [collectively] Bless you. Gesundheit. [Squidward says nothing] Ahem?

12274,Lifeguard,107," Oh. Well, let's go check down by the creek! We'll teach him to dip his feet! [Citizens run off while Squidward tiptoes away. Cuts to Squidward's house at night, where there is a big trap around it. Squidward touches his house, and the trap springs]
",6
12275,Squidward,107," Well Squidward, I guess this is your new life. [cuts to Squidward on a mountain] And this is your new bed. [lays down] Good night, old life. [sobs] I'll miss you.

12278,SpongeBob,107," Patrick and I are having a sleepover, in your belly button. [he and Patrick are in the belly button under a blanket and using the lint as pillows]
",6
12279,Squidward,107," What the? Get out of there! [picks them out] You two have ruined my life! [starts sobbing. SpongeBob and Patrick exchange glances, then float away on a river of Squidward's giant tears]
",6
12280,SpongeBob,107," Oh Patrick, this is terrible! Squidward did not like the kindness we did him.
",6
12281,Patrick,107," So?
",6
12282,SpongeBob,107," We shall do him another. [cuts to SpongeBob's house the next day. Construction sounds can be heard behind a door with a sign saying ""Keep Out.""] We did it! [the roof opens up and a giant present that says ""For Squidward"" pops out. SpongeBob and Patrick leave the house and push the present over to where Squidward is sitting]
",6
12283,Squidward,107," What the?
",6
12284,SpongeBob,107," Since our last kindness didn't go so well, we brought you a new one. [Squidward opens it]
",6
12285,Squidward,107," A giant clarinet? [holds it up. SpongeBob and Patrick nod. Squidward plays it, then gasps] And it sounds divine! [SpongeBob and Patrick gasp excitedly. As Squidward plays, he shrinks back to normal size and falls to the ground] Now I'm too small to play my giant clarinet! [starts bawling. The clarinet falls and crushes him. SpongeBob and Patrick pull him out] It was the most beautiful thing I've ever played! [sighs] Well, at least I still have my kelp garden. [SpongeBob and Patrick laugh nervously] What? [cuts to where Squidward's kelp garden is cut down] You cut it down?
",6
12286,SpongeBob,107," We used your kelp to make a kelp-mâché clarinet. [Squidward gets angry, then begins to chase SpongeBob and Patrick. They scream, then laugh, then scream again]",6

",6
12295,SpongeBob,108," Mr. Krabs, there aren't any chairs.
",6
12296,Mr. Krabs,108," Sit, down! [SpongeBob sits on the floor] Now you've worked here for quite some time, boy.
",6
12297,SpongeBob,108," Ooh yes sir. And they've been the best years of my life, sir.
",6
12298,Mr. Krabs,108," That said fact aside, midway through today's lunch rush, we ran out of, the secret ingredient [Mr. Krabs hold up a bottle] to the secret formula! [Mr. Krabs holds up the formula]
",6
12299,SpongeBob,108," [gasps] NO!
",6
12300,Mr. Krabs,108," Listen up boy, any minute now, a truck driver is going to arrive, and i'm entrusting you to retrieve the secret ingredient! And I need you to do this with out any foulups! Understand?

12301,SpongeBob,108," Could you repeat that? [Mr. Krabs looks at his watch]
",6
12302,Mr. Krabs,108," It's time! [Mr. Krabs presses a button which makes a siren go off, and locks down the whole restaurant. A truck then arrives with S.W.A.T. team members to make a path from the restaurant to the truck] Now go! And make sure to guard it with your life!
",6
12303,SpongeBob,108," I won't let you down.

12304,Mr. Krabs,108," Wait!
",6
12305,SpongeBob,108," Yes?

",6

",6
12308,SpongeBob,108," Uh, SpongeBob.
",6
12309,S.W.A.T. Team Member 1,108," Close enough. [hands SpongeBob the case with the ingredient inside] Now get out of here kid! Plenty of folks would love to get a hold of that ingredient.
",6
12310,SpongeBob,108," Yes sir! [runs back to the Krusty Krab] And now, let's get you into the Krabby Patties, secret ingredienty. [notices the secret ingredient is not there, and gasps] Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? No! What's going to happen to the Krabby Patty secret recipe? [notices a hole] What's this? A hole? How did that happen? An incision. Almost as if someone, or something did this on purpose. That's it! A thief must have cut a hole, and swiped the secret ingredient! But who?
",6
12311,Mr. Krabs,108," SpongeBob! [he hides the case behind his back] What are you doing lolly gagging about? Get back to work!
",6
12312,SpongeBob,108," [laughs] Right away sir.

",6
12316,SpongeBob,108," Hi, Patrick. Maybe you can help me.
",6
12317,Patrick,108," With what?
",6
12318,SpongeBob,108," With this. [shows him the case. Patrick puts some mustard on it, then puts it on buns]
",6
12319,Patrick,108," Here you go, buddy.
",6
12320,SpongeBob,108," Not that kind of help. This used to have the Krabby Patty secret ingredient inside. But now, it's missing!
",6
12321,Patrick,108," What?
",6
12322,SpongeBob,108," Someone stole it, Patrick! And we need to find out who!
",6
12323,Patrick,108," Find out!
",6
12324,SpongeBob,108," You and I are going to need to do a little detective work! [cuts to the Chum Bucket]
",6
12325,Plankton,108," What are we eating this time, Karen?
",6
12326,Karen,108," [puts a Krabby Patty on the plate] Something new.
",6
12327,Plankton,108," Oh, you mean the ""secret recipe"" I came up with?
",6
12328,SpongeBob,108," Aha! I knew it was you!
",6
12329,Plankton,108," What was me?
",6
12330,SpongeBob,108," Oh, come on, Plankton, don't play dumb. You know you stole the secret Krabby Patty ingredient!
",6
12331,Plankton,108," Is this a joke?
",6
12332,SpongeBob,108," Why don't you tell me. Is it?!
",6
12333,Plankton,108," Uh, no.
",6
12334,Patrick,108," [laughs] Good one!
",6
12335,SpongeBob,108," All right, no more jokes! Either you tell me where the secret ingredient is, or we'll be forced to use other means of making you talk! [Patrick holds up two balls on a string, then bangs them together]
",6
12336,Plankton,108," Sorry, I really have nothing for you.
",6
12337,SpongeBob,108," Then how do you explain this? [picks up the Krabby Patty]
",6
12338,Plankton,108," Okay, you caught me.
",6
12339,SpongeBob,108," And so the truth floweth forth.
",6
12340,Plankton,108," Yes, it is a Krabby Patty.
",6
12341,Spongebob,108," Mm-hmm.
",6
12342,Plankton,108," But, it's my version of a Krabby Patty. [both are confused] After thousands of failed attempts to steal the recipe, I learned all but one ingredient needed to make Krabby Patties. The most important ingredient, the secret ingredient. Over the years, I've methodically gone through almost every letter of the alphabet. Right now I'm on the R's. And I've gotten up to raw sewage.
",6
12343,SpongeBob,108," [sniffs the patty] Yuck.
",6
12344,Plankton,108," Try it, tell me what you think. [they walk out of the Chum Bucket]
",6
12345,SpongeBob,108," Well, he's clean. But if Plankton didn't steal the ingredient, who did?
",6
12346,Patrick,108," Good question.
",6
12347,SpongeBob,108," Only someone who specializes in science, could reverse engineer the recipe, based on the secret ingredient. Hmm, a scientist. [cuts to Sandy's treedome. SpongeBob and Patrick sneak up at the treedome, then look around] There she is. [Sandy walks up to her table with a covered plate] You hang back. I'm going in for a closer look. [SpongeBob put's a water helmet on, then drills a hole into Sandy's treedome, then hides behind her tree. Sandy uncovers the plate, revealing Krabby Patties. SpongeBob gasps] Oh, my gosh! It is Sandy! [Sandy digs a hole, and buries the Krabby Patty in it] Enjoying them Krabby Patties lady?
",6
12348,Sandy,108," SpongeBob! How long have you been standing there buddy?
",6
12349,SpongeBob,108," Oh long enough, ""buddy.""
",6
12350,Sandy,108," I was just storing food for the impending winter. Want one?
",6
12351,SpongeBob,108," I'm onto you, squirrel. [sniffs the patty] You thought no one could figure it out, but I pieced it together. I know exactly how you got all those patties.
",6
12352,Sandy,108," What exactly are you getting at, SpongeBob?
",6
12353,SpongeBob,108," What I am getting at, is that you... [screen cuts to what SpongeBob is explaining] ...cloaked yourself  an invisibility potion, snuck through the security perimeter... [Sandy picks up one of the S.W.A.T. Team Member]
",6
12354,S.W.A.T. Team Member 2,108," What was that?
",6
12355,S.W.A.T. Team Member 1,108," Here's the secret Krabby Patty ingredient.
",6
12356,SpongeBob,108," ...then used a time-freezing device to freeze time, used a laser beam to cut open the case, stole the Krabby Patty secret ingredient, [cuts back to SpongeBob and Sandy] reverse engineered it, and made your own patties. So you wouldn't have to pay.
",6
12357,Sandy,108," Or, perhaps I walked into the Krusty Krab, purchased them, [holds up a receipt] and received a receipt for these legally obtained patties!
",6
12358,SpongeBob,108," [reads receipt] 283 Krabby Patties. [laughs nervously] That's right, I cooked this order. I guess this means you didn't use a laser beam, or invisibility.
",6
12359,Sandy,108," SpongeBob, next time before you run around accusing people of things, make sure your own house is in order first!
",6
12360,SpongeBob,108," My own house, huh? [Cut to SpongeBob's house where SpongeBob and Patrick have Gary cornered against a wall, with a light above him] Why'd you do it, Gary?!
",6
12361,Gary,108," [frightened] Meow.
",6
12362,SpongeBob,108," You've told us that story 100 times now, Gary. Unfortunately, my partner and I don't want to hear stories, we want to hear the truth! Look, we know you stole the secret ingredient and it's obvious how you did it! [scene cuts to what SpongeBob is explaining again] First, you hitched a ride on a security chopper, then jumped into the drop zone. Then, when I stopped to pull up my sock, you snuck up behind me, and did what any snail could do. You shot corrosive acid from your tearducts, which melted the case, allowing you to steal the secret ingredient. [cuts back to SpongeBob's house]
",6
12363,Gary,108," [angry] Meow.
",6
12364,SpongeBob,108," Yeah, you're right, Gary, that is impossible. I never would have stopped to pull up my sock during a pickup.
",6
12365,Gary,108," Meow.
",6
12366,SpongeBob,108," What's that, Gary?
",6
12367,Gary,108," Meow.
",6
12368,SpongeBob,108," You did see someone leaving the Krusty Krab with a mysterious black case that night? Mr. Snail, could you please describe this, this marauder to the sketch artist.
",6
12369,Gary,108," Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow.
",6
12370,Patrick,108," I can't believe it! It was Squidward! [shows drawing of Squidward eating a Krabby Patty. Cuts to them in front of Squidward's house]
",6
12371,SpongeBob,108," Open up in there, Tentacles! We know you're in there! We just want to ask you a few... [to Patrick] Not cooperating.
",6
12372,Patrick,108," You know what to do. [SpongeBob picks up Patrick, and uses him as a batting ram]
",6
12373,Squidward,108," And one, and... [screams]
",6
12374,SpongeBob,108," Gotcha! You thought you could hide your crimes.
",6
12375,Patrick,108," But we hear-ed what you've done.
",6
12376,Squidward,108," If I cared, I'd ask what this is about.
",6
12377,SpongeBob,108," Well, I'm glad you asked, because this is about you stealing the Krabby Patty secret ingredient! [scene cuts to what SpongeBob is explaining again] And we have an eye witness who saw you leaving the scene of the crime, with a mysterious black case.
",6
12378,Squidward,108," A case like this? [hands SpongeBob a black suitcase]
",6
12379,SpongeBob,108," Yes! Because you can't make Krabby Patties without... [both gasp] tap dancing shoes?
",6
12380,Squidward,108," That's right! I was in a tap contest on the night in question. As you can see from my third place medallion.
",6
12381,SpongeBob,108," [nervously] I guess this means you didn't steal the secret ingredient. [Squidward snatches the briefcase from SpongeBob and walks outside]
",6
12382,Squidward,108," GET OUT OF MY HOUSE! [Squidward picks up his house, then moves it away from them, then walks inside. Cuts to the Krusty Krab]
",6
12383,SpongeBob,108," Mr. Krabs, I don't know how, sir, but somebody stole the Krabby Patty secret ingredient!
",6
12384,Mr. Krabs,108," SpongeBob, you were in charge of guarding that secret ingredient with your life!
",6
12385,SpongeBob,108," I know, Mr. Krabs. It just slipped away from me somehow.
",6
12386,Mr. Krabs,108," Well, do you have any leads, or clues?
",6
12387,SpongeBob,108," All I know is that it had to be someone who knew about the delivery, and was at the Krusty Krab during the delivery, and this person would have to know what to do with the secret ingredient when he got it.
",6
12388,Mr. Krabs,108," That would be... you, SpongeBob! You stole me secret ingredient!
",6
12389,SpongeBob,108," Me?!
",6
12390,Mr. Krabs,108," That's right. And I know exactly how you carried out this little caper. [cuts to what Mr. Krabs is explaining] You obviously set up a decoy to take the delivery. Then when no one was looking, you swooped in, stole the secret ingredient, and spirited it away to the Chum Bucket, [cuts back to the Krusty Krab] where you sold it to Plankton to make a quick buck. [SpongeBob tries to talk, but Mr. Krabs stops him] Don't talk! You can tell it to the cops, 'cause I'm calling them right now! [policemen come out from hiding in a barrel]
",6
12391,Policeman,108," No need. We heard it all from this barrel.
",6
12392,Mr. Krabs,108," [In a Russian accent] Then arrest this thief, Officer! [points at him with the secret ingredient]
",6
12393,SpongeBob,108," Mr. Krabs, isn't that the stolen secret ingredient?
",6
12394,Mr. Krabs,108," Uh, what are you talking about, SpongeBob? I'm not holding any secret ingredient. [holds it out, then hides it]
",6
12395,Policeman,108," You might want to stand that you stole the item in question?
",6
12396,Mr. Krabs,108," Well, I wouldn't call it stealing...
",6
12397,Policeman,108," And you were going to let someone else take the fall for this little caper?
",6
12398,Mr. Krabs,108," I can explain!
",6
12399,Policeman,108," Please do.
",6
12400,Mr. Krabs,108," It's simple, $1.99 is a lot to pay for the secret ingredient every time I get a delivery, so I s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s... took it to avoid paying, you know.
",6
12401,Policeman,108," I think Judge Trout will be very interested to hear this little story. [handcuffs him]
",6
12402,Mr. Krabs,108," What? What'd I do? [cuts to the court house]
",6
12403,Judge,108," All rise. Eugene Krabs.
",6
12404,Mr. Krabs,108," Your honor.
",6
12405,Judge,108," As punishment for committing the crime of grand theft, I sentence you to give away Krabby Patties for free, all day tomorrow.
",6
12406,Mr. Krabs,108," Give away me Patties for free? Oh no, I couldn't bear the sight of that. [cuts to next day at the Krusty Krab, and Mr. Krabs is screaming]
",6
12407,SpongeBob,108," Step right up, and get your free Krabby Patties! [When SpongeBob gives away free Krabby Patties, the two policemen holds Mr. Krabs still while he is crying, then the policemen laugh ]",6

12450,SpongeBob,109," Don't worry Squidward, we're boating buddies now! I'll teach you everything I know, and then we can.

",6
12466,Mrs. Puff,109," Your's too? Uhh. What I meant to say was, please come up to the chalkboard, and draw a diagram of the incident.

12467,Squidward,109," Gladly. [begins drawing what he is saying] It all started when I left my house. And then, he appeared. He made, an immediate right turn, and parked, here. [referring to Squidward's house] Seeing the oncoming hazard, I looked both ways, and proceeded safely toward my vehicle. It was then, that I realized that I was being followed, at an unsafe distance. So, in order to create more optimal driving conditions, I was then forced to par-take in [screeches the chalk board] evasive action. And by increasing speed slightly, I created a safety cushion, while in-invertenttly attracting the attention, of said law enforcement official. May I sit down now, sweet cheeks?
",6
12468,Mrs. Puff,109," Why, certainly. And perhaps now, SpongeBob would like to come up, and illustrate his side of the story.
",6
12469,Squidward,109," His side?
",6
12470,SpongeBob,109," Well, first, I started over here. And then I went way over here. Do-do-do-do, like that. Then, I went around like this, and over here like that, and across this lane, and down here like this, and then [continues writing, without speaking] and then I went around, and stopped right here. [We See The Bubbly Transition]
",6
12471,Everyone,109," SpongeBob and Squidward, best boating buddies, forever. [all are confused, then SpongeBob sits down]
",6
12472,SpongeBob,109," Do you like it Squidward?
",6
12473,Squidward,109," Shut it. [bell rings, then cuts to everyone eating lunch, and SpongeBob sits next to Squidward]
",6
12474,SpongeBob,109," Ah, lunch time, eh boating buddy? [SpongeBob sits, and Squidward walks away, over to the trash cans]
",6
12475,Squidward,109," I'll have to eat over here, like in grade school. [Squidward is about to eat, then SpongeBob pops up from a trash can]
",6
12476,SpongeBob,109," Squidward, do you have any mustard in there? [Squidward runs away screaming, then cuts to the bathroom, where Squidward is eating]
",6
12477,Squidward,109," Mm, bon appetite, Squidy. [is about to eat, but then sees SpongeBob's feet in the other stall. Squidward gets angry, and throws his sandwich on the ground] You've ruined my morning, you've ruined my lunch, and you're ruining my... [door opens, revealing that it's a muscular tough fish, with feet that looks like SpongeBob's. Scene cuts to Squidward walking to his seat, bandaged up]
",6
12478,Mrs. Puff,109," Okay class, it's time for our behind the wheel lesson. Squidward, you'll be riding with SpongeBob.
",6
12479,Squidward,109," Eh, didn't see that coming. [cuts to them in a boat]
",6
12480,Mrs. Puff,109,"  Now, we're going to take this nice and slow. SpongeBob, what do we do when pulling away from the curb?
",6
12481,SpongeBob,109," Uh, step on the gas?
",6
12482,Mrs. Puff,109," Good. Nice and easy. Now let's slowly... [SpongeBob steps on the petal, and Mrs. Puff screams]
",6
12483,Squidward,109," SpongeBob, look out! [they bump through the cones, then they barge out through the fence, then they go through a red light] SpongeBob, give me that wheel!
",6
12484,SpongeBob,109," I got it, I got it. [they fight over it]
",6
12485,Squidward,109," Just let go of it! [the steering wheel breaks, and Mrs. Puff screams. They drive into grandma]
",6
12486,Grandma,109," Hooligans! [they drive through the Barg 'n Mart, and a costume shop, and they are about to drive into a secret lab]
",6
12487,Scientest 1,109," Johnson, I finally figured out a way to shrink an ordinary mail man, down to the size of a grain of sand.
",6
12488,Scientist 2,109," How?
",6
12489,Scientist 1,109," By using this shrink ray. [he pulls a lever that turns it on, then the boat comes in, and they get shrunk instead]
",6
12490,Scientist 2,109," Mother of mercy! [they shrink] Where'd they go?
",6
12491,Scientist 1,109," There! There heading right for that discarded potato chip. [mail man growls]
",6
12492,Scientist 2,109," What's the matter?
",6
12493,Scientist 1,109," Potato chips are his favorite snack. [he breaks out] Johnson! No! [is about to eat it, but then gets sprayed with water]
",6
12494,Scientist 2,109," No, no, no. [they then go through a drain. A cowboy is about to drink from a drinking fountain, but then Mrs. Puff and SpongeBob come out and return to normal size]
",6
12495,Cowboy,109," I never will understand these city folk.
",6
12496,SpongeBob,109," Hey, where'd Squidward go? [the tough fish from earlier is going to go to the bathroom again, and Squidward returns to normal in the toilet]
",6
12497,Squidward,109," I was just leaving. [cuts to Squidward walking toward his desk all bandaged up]
",6
12498,Mrs. Puff,109," Okay class, it's time to take our final exam. Please have your pencils ready.
",6
12499,SpongeBob,109," Pst, hey, boating buddy, if you need any help, I've taken this test hundreds of times, and.
",6
12500,Squidward,109," How many times do I have to tell you?! I am not your buddy! I don't need your help, and I don't need you, ever! Now just kindly let me take this stupid test, so I can get out of here, and never have to see you again, for the rest of my life!
",6
12501,SpongeBob,109," [sadly] Okay Squidward, if that's the way you want it.
",6
12502,Squidward,109," Thank you. [tries to pick up his pencil, then picks it up in both hands, but then it drops and rolls out the room]
",6
12503,Mrs. Puff,109," 3 more minutes class.
",6
12504,Squidward,109," SpongeBob? SpongeBob, I need your help.
",6
12505,Mrs. Puff,109," 2 more minutes.
",6
12506,Squidward,109," SpongeBob, please? This is important.
",6
12507,SpongeBob,109," You said you didn't need my help, Squidward, and that you didn't need me.
",6
12508,Squidward,109," No no, I didn't. I never said that. [Student play's back what Squidward said] I don't need your help, and I don't need you! [now talking] Jerk! [student shrugs] All right, I said it. But that was before.
",6
12509,SpongeBob,109," Before what?
",6
12510,Squidward,109," Before before.
",6
12511,Mrs. Puff,109," 1 more minute, class.
",6
12512,Squidward,109," Before we were, [gulps] boating buddies.
",6
12513,SpongeBob,109," Yay!
",6
12514,Mrs. Puff,109," Okay class, times up.
",6
12515,Squidward,109," Time can't be up. I didn't even get a chance to fill in a single answer. What am I supposed to do?
",6
12516,Mrs. Puff,109," You do the same thing that everybody else does who failed the test, you take it again next week.
",6
12517,Squidward,109," Next week?
",6
12518,SpongeBob,109," Don't worry Squidward, I've never gotten one answer right on this test. [screen cuts to outside] But we'll meet again next week, at Mrs. Puff's boating school! [Squidward screams]",6

",6
12557,Mr. Krabs,110," Is that what girls do at slumber parties?

",6
12571,Boy Fish #1,110," Ha! Destroying other people’s possessions is fun! [The boys cause havoc at the slumber party. They even burn some money, which frightens Mr. Krabs]

12578,Mr. Krabs,110," No! Pearl and her no-good friends! They’re probably destroying me house right now! Like this! [He knocks over a plant and mocks a teenager] Oops! I don’t care! It’s not mine!

",6
12581,SpongeBob,110," Oh, I do, Mr. Krabs. It must be horrible to invite people into your home and have them treat your property with so little respect! [We see SpongeBob's house now. It is destroyed]
",6
12582,Mr. Krabs,110," That’s what teenagers do! Do you want this to happen to my house?
",6
12583,SpongeBob,110," Gosh, no, Mr. Krabs.
",6
12584,Mr. Krabs,110," Then get into Pearl’s party and find out what they’re doing!
",6
12585,SpongeBob,110," Leave it to me, Mr. K. I’ve got the perfect disguise. [At Mr. Krabs’s house, Pearl and her friends are in Pearl's room, laughing and reading magazines. There is a knock on the door. Pearl answers it]

12590,Pearl,110," [suspicious] Uh-huh.

12592,Pearl,110," I know it’s you, SpongeBob SquarePants!
",6
12593,Girly,110," I don’t know what you’re talking about! [Pearl pulls her hair and lifts her up into the air; Girly screams]
",6
12594,Pearl,110," You were sent to spy on me by my dad! Get him, girls!
",6
12595,Girly,110," [screams as the girls start attacking her. Girly soon runs away with fruit being thrown at her]
",6
12596,Girly,110," [crying] I am so moving back to Farawayville! [SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs drive up in a pizza delivery truck]
",6
12597,Mr. Krabs,110," Who the heck is that?
",6
12598,SpongeBob,110," I don’t know, but she is ug-ly! Now to put on that disguise I told you about. [He puts on a phony mustache] Ta-daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrgh! Huh? Huh? Huh?
",6
12599,Mr. Krabs,110," You are one-of-a-kind, boy. [SpongeBob knocks on the door of Mr. Krabs's house, holding a pizza box]

12601,Pearl,110," We didn’t order any pizza!

12602,SpongeBob,110," Y-You didn’t?
",6
12603,Mr. Krabs,110," SpongeBob, tell ‘em it’s from me!
",6
12604,SpongeBob,110," Your dad sent it. It’s already paid for.
",6
12605,Pearl,110," [Opens the door] I’d sooner believe space aliens sent me a free pizza before I’d believe my dad would! Now, who are you?
",6
12606,SpongeBob,110," Um.. uh... [His mustache flutters away] Hey!
",6
12607,Pearl,110," SpongeBob?!
",6
12608,SpongeBob,110," They’re on to us, Mr. Krabs! Drive!
",6
12609,Mr. Krabs,110," Right, boy! [He drives off without SpongeBob]
",6
12610,SpongeBob,110," I wanted to come with you, Mr. Krabs. [The girls grab SpongeBob]
",6
12611,Pearl,110," Get him!
",6
12612,SpongeBob,110," [screams and drops the empty pizza box. It opens]
",6
12613,Pearl,110," Oh, big surprise. Dad was too cheap to buy real pizza! [Back at SpongeBob’s house, Mr. Krabs is digging through SpongeBob's box in his bedroom]
",6
12614,Mr. Krabs,110," What’s taking SpongeBob so long? I’m getting tired of looking through his stuff. [There is a knock on the door]
",6
12615,Mr. Krabs,110," [Answers it] Hello? [Sees the pizza box] Pizza! [SpongeBob, in the shape of a pizza, is inside]
",6
12616,SpopngeBob,110," I’m sorry, Mr. Krabs. I failed you.
",6
12617,Mr. Krabs,110," I know, son. [takes a slice of SpongeBob]
",6
12618,SpongeBob,110," Oh, Mr. Krabs, that’s my eye! [Mr. Krabs bites slice, then spits it out]
",6
12619,Mr. Krabs,110," And it’s ice cold, too. You should have been back here in 30 minutes or less! [takes another slice. At Krabs and Pearl's house, the girls are playing a board game. There is a knock on the door]
",6
12620,Pearl,110," Who is it?
",6
12621,SpongeBob,110," [disguised] Piano repair man! [The girls are giggling]
",6
12622,Pearl,110," Okay! We’ll be right out!
",6
12623,SpongeBob,110," Mr. Krabs, it’s working! [Pearl and her friends drop the piano on SpongeBob from the roof]
",6
12624,Pearl,110," Have it back by tomorrow, OK?
",6
12625,SpongeBob,110," [squashed] Maybe we should leave them alone, Mr. Krabs. They seem pretty trustworthy.
",6
12626,Mr. Krabs,110," You get into that party, or you’re fired!
",6
12627,SpongeBob,110," Yes, Mr. Krabs. [There is another knock on the door of Pearl and Mr. Krabs's house]
",6
12628,Pearl,110," Whoever could it be this time?
",6
12629,SpongeBob,110," It’s me, SpongeBob SquarePants. Can we talk, Pearl? Whale to sponge?
",6
12630,Pearl,110," [to her friends on the roof] Hold the boiling oil! [Her friends groan] What do you want, SpongeBob?
",6
12631,SpongeBob,110," Oh, please let me stay at your party! Oh, please, oh, please, oh, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please!
",6
12632,Pearl,110," No!
",6
12633,SpongeBob,110," Give me one good reason why I can’t stay!
",6
12634,Pearl,110," I can give you a hundred million billion reasons!
",6
12635,SpongeBob,110," Yeesh, I only asked for one.
",6
12636,SpongeBob,110," Really?!
",6
12637,Pearl,110," A no-good, dried-up, old fuddy-duddy!
",6
12638,SpongeBob,110," So if I prove I’m fun, can I stay?
",6
12639,Pearl,110," Sure, SpongeBob. If you can prove you’re the most fun person on the planet in the next ten seconds, you can stay.
",6
12640,SpongeBob,110," I only need eight! [He runs inside]
",6
12641,SpongeBob,110," Whoo! Party! [cranks up record player] Crank it up!
",6
12642,Pearl,110," Five seconds.
",6
12643,SpongeBob,110," These old newspapers are confetti in fun hands! Whoo!
",6
12644,Girl 1,110," I’m allergic to newsprint! [starts blotching] Oh, ow!
",6
12645,Pearl,110," Two seconds! [Opens up a trap door to Mr. Krabs' root beer cellar. SpongeBob falls inside] OK, OK, I got to admit. That was kinda fun.
",6
12646,Girl 2,110," I think he’s hurt.
",6
12647,Pearl,110," He’s not hurt. [SpongeBob groans] See?
",6
12648,Girl 2,110," Maybe he’s a zombie!
",6
12649,Girl 1,110," If he comes back as a zombie and eats my brain, I’m totally not going to be your friend anymore! [Pearl closes the trap door]
",6
12650,SpongeBob,110," [recovers] Ooh, Mr. Krabs' root beer cellar. [Opens all the root beer kegs which fills up the cellar. SpongeBob absorbs it all. Upstairs, the girls are watching the same movie SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs were watching]
",6
12651,TV Announcer,110," We now return to Slumber Party Zombie Attack!
",6
12652,Girl on TV,110," [screams] A zombie! [A slimy, ugly thing appears on screen]
",6
12653,Pearl,110," This movie isn’t all that scary!
",6
12654,Girl 1,110," Yeah, that zombie looks totally fake! [The trap door creaks open, and the girls look. SpongeBob emerges enormous and dripping with root beer, similar to the one on TV]
",6
12655,SpongeBob,110," [gurgling] Party!
",6
12656,Girls,110," [screams] Zombie!
",6
12657,SpongeBob,110," Fun! [Squirts root beer out of his body]
",6
12658,Girl 3,110," [screams and gets soaked by root beer and falls down]
",6
12659,Girl 4,110," Zombie juice! [gets blasted and falls down]
",6
12660,Girl 5,110," [Screams] Run!
",6
12661,Pearl,110," [Screams as she narrowly avoids a root beer blast, which soaks some knick-knacks. Root beer starts pouring out of the windows with random girls sliding out]
",6
12662,SpongeBob,110," [gurgling] Who wants to dance?
",6
12663,Girl 6,110," No! I already have a zombie boyfriend!
",6
12664,SpongeBob,110," Let’s boogie! Whoo! [He starts spinning two girls in circles and get thrown out of windows. The house keeps spewing more soda and eventually breaks the door down. The spewing stops as Mr. Krabs pops onto the scene]
",6
12665,Mr. Krabs,110," What in Neptune’s toupee is going on here? [screams] Me knick-knacks! [screams] Me root beer! [Walks past Pearl] Me pile of old newspapers! [crying] I was maybe gonna read that someday! [to Pearl] I knew I shouldn’t have trusted you!
",6
12666,Pearl,110," Trusted me? Your employee destroyed this house! [Picks up SpongeBob from inside the record player] The only boy at the party!
",6
12667,Mr. Krabs,110," SpongeBob?!
",6
12668,SpongeBob,110," [normal voice] Well, Mr. Krabs, you know how boys are. [Pearl drops him] Ow!
",6

12670,Girl 6,110," [rocking back and forth] I’m too pretty to be a zombie!

12671,Pearl,110," We were fine with a nice simple slumber party. But now, it’s gonna cost you!

12672,Mr. Krabs,110," Cost me what?

12673,Pearl,110," [sinister] Money...
",6
12674,Mr. Krabs,110," Nooo!
",6
12675,Pearl,110," Everyone having a good time? [crowd cheering] Well, you can all thank my dad for making this possible! Thank you, daddy! [Mr. Krabs is far away behind a velvet rope. A boss hog is watching him]
",6
12676,Mr. Krabs,110," You’re welcome, sweetie! [leaning on rope] Oh, this is so expensive!
",6
12677,Boss Hog,110," You’re not allowed any closer, sir. [SpongeBob appears]
",6
12678,SpongeBob,110," Mr. Krabs, I think I know what’ll cheer you up. [Puts drinking glass under his armpit and squirts some root beer into it] A mug of ice cold root beer!

12679,Mr. Krabs,110," No, SpongeBob, that doesn’t cheer me up at all.",6

[Blood shoots out of the water] Water spouts.... of blood. [Three donuts fall from the sky. Krabs takes a bite of one] Jelly donuts falling from the sky. What could this mean? There's only one logical answer. I've landed right in the middle of Dutchman's Triangle. Right above Davy Jones' Locker. In the Devil's Galley. [another donut falls from the sky. The scene cuts to an island. Not the one Sandy landed on, but an island]

12747,Twitch,111," Hey there, home-dads.
",6
12748,SpongeBob,111," Huh?
",6
12749,Twitch,111," Welcome to our remote island.
",6
12750,SpongeBob,111," Island?
",6
12751,Squidward,111," Island?
",6
12752,Twitch,111," That's right, kemosabay. Island. Although, we sometimes refer to it as an... island.
",6
12753,SpongeBob,111," We were just at Goo Lagoon selling Krabby Patties when this big wave hit us. Now we're on an island?
",6
12754,Twitch,111," The ocean works in mysterious ways.
",6
12755,Awesome Eddie,111," And waves.
",6
12756,Twitch,111," Mysterious waves.
",6
12757,Island wanderers,111," [fold hands] Om. [except for Silent Stan but he does put his hands together]
",6
12758,Patrick,111," [folds hands] Om.
",6
12759,SpongeBob,111," How did you guys get here?
",6
12760,Twitch,111," Oh, we've been here since we dropped out of junior college. This is Awesome Eddie, Big G...
",6
12761,Chip,111," Hi.
",6
12762,Twitch,111," Chip, and Silent Stan.
",6
12763,Twitch,111," And I'm Twitch.
",6
12764,SpongeBob,111," Why do they call you Twitch?
",6
12765,Twitch,111," [twitches] What?
",6
12766,SpongeBob,111," Never mind.
",6
12767,SpongeBob,111," So what did you say this house is made from again?
",6
12768,Twitch,111," Guano.
",6
12769,Squidward,111," Great.
",6
12770,SpongeBob,111," Well, it's been fun hanging out with you guys, but Mr. Krabs didn't give us the day off. So we gotta get back to Goo Lagoon.
",6
12771,Twitch,111," Yo, you're miles from the tourist track now, dude.
",6
12772,Awesome Eddie,111," Yeah. The only way back is to surf there.
",6
12773,SpongeBob,111," [scared] O-only way.... back... surfing.... Bikini Bottom? AAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!! [starts running in circles around the fire] I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SURF!!! [starts crying]
",6
12774,Awesome Eddie,111," Whoa, chill out, little dude. We can teach you.
",6
12775,SpongeBob,111," [stops running and crying] Cool!
",6
12776,Narrator,111," Ah, learning how to surf. To some it comes as easily as eating an ice cream cone on a hot day.
",6
12777,Narrator,111," Others...
",6
12778,Narrator,111," ... well... to them, it's like eating an ice cream cone... on a cold day. Sometimes, in surfing, it's the approach that's most important.
",6
12779,SpongeBob and Patrick,111," [throw their boards into the water]
",6
12780,Narrator,111," And sometimes, it's the retreat.
",6
12781,Narrator,111," Once in a life-time, that perfect wave comes along. Not too big, not too small, and the surfer has to act fast...
",6
12782,Twitch,111," Go!
",6
12783,Narrator,111," ... or he stands to miss the ride of his life.
",6
12784,SpongeBob,111," Hey, Patrick! Wanna see something cool?
",6
12785,Patrick,111," You bet!
",6
12786,SpongeBob,111," Down here! [goes underwater with Patrick] See? It's a picture of Squidward!
",6
12787,Patrick,111," Wow.
",6
12788,Narrator,111," But all in all, in life, it's not whether we win or lose, but whether we get totally stoked.
",6
12789,SpongeBob and Patrick,111," [running around while yelling, ""Loo, loo, loo!"" over and over again.. The scene cuts back to the house made of guano]
",6
12790,Twitch,111," Well, dudes, I give up.
",6
12791,Awesome Eddie,111," What?
",6
12792,Twitch,111," These ho-dads are impossible to teach. [twitches] Especially the one on the end over there. [points to Squidward, whose head is wet and has seaweed on it. Big G coughs]
",6
12793,Awesome Eddie,111," What's that?
",6
12794,Awesome Eddie,111," Oh, no. There's no way, dude. He'd never do it.
",6
12795,SpongeBob,111," What's he saying?
",6
12796,Twitch,111," He reminded us that there is one dude who could possibly teach you. If you can find him.
",6
12797,SpongeBob,111," Who?
",6
12798,Twitch,111," His name [twitches] is Jack Kahuna Laguna. Or JKL, for short.
",6
12799,Awesome Eddie and Chip,111," Amen. [Big G coughs]
",6
12800,Twitch,111," We say that legend says that JKL was last seen up-river at the Kahmamoku Cove, where every wave is perfect.
",6
12801,Patrick,111," Will there be nachos there? [Squidward looks angrily at him. The scene cuts to the river that SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward are about to go into]
",6
12802,SpongeBob,111," Thanks again for letting us borrow these surfboards, Twitch.
",6
12803,Twitch,111," [twitches] No problem. And just keep following the river straight up until you hit Kahmamoku Cove. Can't miss it.
",6
12804,SpongeBob,111," How far up stream did you say it was?
",6
12805,Twitch,111," Well, we don't know cause we've never ever been there.
",6
12806,Awesome Eddie,111," We're definitely afraid of this river and wouldn't even set foot in it if you paid us.
",6
12807,Twitch,111," Yeah, interpret that any way you want.
",6
12808,Sandy,111," Oh, where am I? Where is everybody? I'm stranded. SpongeBob, where are you?!!
",6
12809,SpongeBob,111," Could you pull over here? I gotta tie my shoe.
",6
12810,Squidward,111," Again?!
",6
12811,SpongeBob,111," [walks through a bush and comes across a sign that says, Welcome to Kahmamoku Cove, Home of J.K.L., ESO] Welcome to Kahmamoku Cove! JKL! Guys! Guys!! I found the Cove!! [giggles]
",6
12812,Squidward,111," I bet this guy won't even be here. If he's anything like that last group of dirty drop-outs.
",6
12813,SpongeBob,111," Oh, don't worry, Squidward. He'll be here.
",6
12814,Squidward,111," You've never even seen him!
",6
12815,SpongeBob,111," You've got to stop judging people by the way they look. [close-up on his face. He is very ugly]
",6
12816,Squidward,111," [grossed out] You're right.
",6
12817,Patrick,111," [pointing to a hut] Look!
",6
12818,SpongeBob,111," It's him!
",6
12819,Squidward,111," [sighs. The surfboard continues to come out. It is revealed to be huge] Oh, my j- [faints. A man emerges from the hut]
",6
12820,SpongeBob,111," It's JKL! Hail O great swami of the Gnarly Pounders! We seek audience with thee.
",6
12821,Patrick,111," Plus, we wanna talk to you.
",6
12822,SpongeBob,111," Will you teach us how to surf, O great one, so we may get back home? [JKL says nothing]
",6
12823,Patrick,111," Uh...
",6
12824,Squidward,111," Look, surf-boy, are you gonna teach us how to surf, or are we just gonna stand here and stare at you all day?
",6
12825,Patrick,111," I kinda like staring at him.
",6
12826,SpongeBob,111," I've never seen anything more beautiful. Have you, Patrick?
",6
12827,Patrick,111," Not since I saw my first triple-layer cheese cake.
",6
12828,JKL,111," That... was your first lesson. [returns to his hut]
",6
12829,Squidward,111," What? You call that a lesson? We just stood here and watched you surf for two and a half hours!
",6
12830,JKL,111," [magically returnes to the water. we then see him playing his drums] Just keep breathing.
",6
12831,Mr. Krabs,111," Locust. Culinary! Oh. [pulls a shell out of the water] Look, Cashy! [breaks the shell in half and connects them to the sides of the seaweed] Earrings! Well, Cashy, I guess the Devil's Galley isn't so bad. As long as that Flying Dutchman doesn’t appear and stick us in Davy Jones' Locker! But that won't happen, will it Cashy? [Cashy's drawer shoots out and hits the Flying Dutchman in the head who's flying by]
",6
12832,Flying Dutchman,111," Ow!
",6
12833,Mr. Krabs,111," Arrrgh! It's the Flying Dutchman!
",6
12834,Dutchman,111," [drops his groceries] Aaahhh! It's some guy I've never seen before! Argh! Who be disturbing the Flying Dutchman's walk home from the communion store? You even spilled me milk!
",6
12835,Mr. Krabs,111," Well, there ain't no use crying over it. [Lightning bolts shoot everywhere] Yah! Don't worry, Cashy! I’ll protect ye!
",6
12836,SpongeBob,111," Isn't Jack Kahuna Laguna the most totally awesome surf guru you've ever met, Squidward?
",6
12837,Squidward,111," I don't know about you two, but I'd like to get out of here at some point, and if his idea of teaching us is...
",6
12838,Squidward,111," [sarcastic] Oh, wonderful.
",6
12839,SpongeBob,111," Quiet, Squidward! I think we're about to receive another lesson.
",6
12840,JKL,111," [plays his drums. Eventually, he stops, lifts his hands to the air, then plays the drums again] Just... keep breathing. [returns to his hut]
",6
12841,Squidward,111," That's it?! I just wanna go home! [buries his head in his lap]
",6
12842,SpongeBob,111," Would it make you feel better if I went and talked to him?
",6
12843,Squidward,111," Oh, thank you. Thank you, SpongeBob. [SpongeBob walks away, then immediately returns] Well, did you talk to him?
",6
12844,SpongeBob,111," Yup.
",6
12845,Squidward,111," And?
",6
12846,SpongeBob,111," He said we just have to stare into this fire all night, and the secrets will be revealed.
",6
12847,Squidward,111," We're gonna be stuck here forever!!
",6
12848,Sandy,111," Well, Sandy, using only your bare hands and the resources found on this deserted island, you have not only survived, but thrived. You've built a five star hotel, a steam-powered generator, a car that runs on coconut milk, and even a espresso bar. I almost don't wanna leave. But I miss Bikini Bottom. Now I can find SpongeBob and the gang and fly us right back. [climbs into and activates her helicopter] Acorn 1 to Tower. Request clearance.
",6
12849,Dennis,111," Roger, Acorn 1. You are clear for take-off.
",6
12850,Mr. Krabs,111," Oh, please, Mr. Dutchman! I didn't mean to spill your groceries!
",6
12851,Flying Dutchman,111," Well, normally, I wouldn't mind, but I'm a little low on cash this month, so I have no way to pay for more. Unless you have some money I can borrow.
",6
12852,Mr. Krabs,111," No, I... [Dutchman grabs Cashy] Cashy! Please! Cashy is the closest thing to a friend I've ever had!
",6
12853,Squidward,111," Oh, oh. Please tell me you two didn't stare into that fire all night.
",6
12854,SpongeBob and Patrick,111," [tired from staring all night] Okay...
",6
12855,Squidward,111," All right, I'm done! Hey, blondey! Teach me how to surf so I can go home, or I'm gonna...
",6
12856,JKL,111," You obviously didn't stare into the fire all night like your friends over there.
",6
12857,JKL,111," Those dudes are gonna make awesome surfers. [A storm of lightning starts. JKL runs away]
",6
12858,SpongeBob,111," Where's he going?! Come on! [chases after JKL. Patrick and Squidward follow SpongeBob. SpongeBob and Patrick are running, but Squidward is walking. SpongeBob and Patrick climb up a cliff]
",6
12859,SpongeBob,111," [gets shocked by lightning] AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!
",6
12860,Patrick,111," Look! He's on top of that big... drinking fountain!
",6
12861,SpongeBob,111," JKL! Is this the next part of our training?
",6
12862,JKL,111," [hands in the air. He says this in a strange, echoing voice] Uh...
",6
12863,"SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward",111," [screaming in some way]
",6
12864,JKL,111," These clouds. They can only mean one thing.
",6
12865,Patrick,111," Increased chance of precipitation? [it starts raining]
",6
12866,JKL,111," Yes. Every thousand years or so, the planets align in such a way that a perfect wave is formed.
",6
12867,SpongeBob,111," A perfect wave?
",6
12868,JKL,111," The world's biggest, fastest, longest, gnarliest, most totally awesome, perfect wave. They call it.... the Big One.
",6
12869,Patrick,111," Hey, that's what they used to call me!
",6
12870,JKL,111," It's probably the only wave big enough for you to ride all the way back to Bikini Bottom. And you'll have to catch it, or you'll be stuck here... forever. [Huge lightning bolts flash] The Big One is almost upon us.
",6
12871,Mr. Krabs,111," Please! Please, Mr. Dutchman! Let Cashy go! I promise I'll never soil your waters again!
",6
12872,Flying Dutchman,111," Ya promise?
",6
12873,Mr. Krabs,111," Oh, yes. I promise on my dear Aunt Sally's false teeth.
",6
12874,Flying Dutchman,111," [angry] Liar!!! [Huge lightning bolts flash. Storm clouds hover and waves emerge from the water]
",6
12875,Mr. Krabs,111," What?
",6
12876,Flying Dutchman,111," Your Aunt Sally doesn't wear false teeth!
",6
12877,Mr. Krabs,111," How do you know?
",6
12878,Flying Dutchman,111," Because I dated her in high school!
",6
12879,Mr. Krabs,111," [Gasp!] No!! [Dutchman takes Cashy]
",6
12880,Flying Dutchman,111," Whoops! [accidentally throws Cashy]
",6
12881,Flying Dutchman,111," And now, just to make sure this never happens again, I'm gonna send you on a little trip down the- [Sandy's helicopter hits him in the head] -Ooh ow, ooh ow! Ooh! Ooh!
",6
12882,Mr. Krabs,111," Uh... where is that, exactly? [Dutchman lands on him. They both go underwater]
",6
12883,Sandy,111," [spinning out of control] May Day!
",6
12884,Mr. Krabs,111," [pops up from underwater] Oh, all alone again. [Cashy pops up from the water] Cashy!
",6
12885,Flying Dutchman,111," [lands at the bottom of the ocean. A sock lands on his face] Oh, what the... a gym sock? But that means...
",6
12886,Davy Jones,111," Yeah, that's right, baby! Welcome... to my locker! Ha ha ha ha ha ha!!!♪For a day-dream believer and a homecoming queen!♪ [throws a sock at the Flying Dutchman. Music plays] The scene cuts to Kahmamoku Cove]
",6
12887,JKL,111," Get ready, dudes. It's coming.
",6
12888,SpongeBob,111," JKL, thanks for teaching us how to surf.
",6
12889,JKL,111," Little dude, I didn't teach you anything you didn't already know.
",6
12890,Squidward,111," Here it comes!!
",6
12891,SpongeBob,111," Well, JKL, I guess this is good-bye.
",6
12892,JKL,111," Wait. There's something I forgot to tell you. In return for its awesomeness, the Big One always demands a sacrifice. One of you... will not return.
",6

[a high pitched scream in the distance] I'd know that sound anywhere! It’s a terrifying shriek! But where’s it coming from? [he looks from behind a rock and finds Patrick shrieking] Patrick, what is with all the shrieking? You know I walk here on Tuesdays.
",6
12950,Patrick,112," Sorry, SpongeBob. That wasn’t me.
",6
12951,SpongeBob,112," Patrick, I know I heard a terrifying shriek.
",6
12952,Patrick,112," So did I, SpongeBob, but I was just mimicking it.
",6
12953,SpongeBob,112," [Patrick mimicking] So, you were mimicking it. Patrick, please don’t do that. It is really…
",6
12954,SpongeBob,112," Wait a minute, if the shriek wasn’t coming from you, then where was it…it’s over there, behind that kelp shrub!

12960,Patrick,112," I got the TV remote stuck in my throat!

",6
12965,Patrick,112," Well, SpongeBob, I think I might go catch a movie.
",6
12966,SpongeBob,112," Hey, what about the clam?

12994,Clerk,112," Oh, it uh…it won’t take long at all. [picks up pearl] Ooh, it’s heavier than I imagined. And, uh, shinier, too. Where’d you find it?
",6
12995,SpongeBob,112," We found it deep in Jellyfish Fields.
",6
12996,Clerk,112," Really? What was it doing there?
",6
12997,SpongeBob,112," Choking a clam.
",6
12998,Clerk,112," Well, um…ahem…what would you say if I were to offer you a small fortune in exchange for your shiny ball?

13000,SpongeBob,112," Whoa. How many more trucks do you think there’ll be, Patrick?
",6
13001,Patrick,112," Huh? Oh, I don’t know. I am getting kinda hungry, though. I’ll catch up with you later, SpongeBob.
",6
13002,SpongeBob,112," Well, that looked like the last of them.

13005,Patrick,112," So, did you figure out what you’re gonna do with this fat stack of cabbage, yet?

",6
13007,SpongeBob,112," Wow, your dad really told you that?
",6
13008,Patrick,112," Well, what he said was, ‘How many times do I have to tell you not to stand there?’ But I knew what he meant.
",6
13009,SpongeBob,112," Hey, Patrick, I know a good place to go when you don’t know what to buy.

",6
13082,SpongeBob,112," No matter, he’s simply jealous of my glamorous new lifestyle.
",6
13083,Mr. Krabs,112," Say, that reminds me…can I have some money?
",6
13084,SpongeBob,112," Why certainly. I always remember to… [pulls out empty pocket. Crowd gasps] Oh, I forgot. I keep it in this other pocket. [empty pocket. Crowd gasps] Uh, will you excuse me for a moment?
",6
13085,SpongeBob,112," Noooooooooo! [walks back to party] Well, everyone, I hope this doesn’t put a damper on things, but I just checked and, well it’s just that all my money is… [everyone is gone] …gone.

",6
13089,SpongeBob,112," Whatcha doing?
",6
13090,Patrick,112," Oh, the same thing us sea stars are usually doing, I guess. Laying up against a rock.
",6
13091,SpongeBob,112," Patrick, I was wrong.
",6
13092,Patrick,112," About what?
",6
13093,SpongeBob,112," The money, and about those people being my friends.
",6
13094,Patrick,112," There is no right or wrong when it comes to that stuff, SpongeBob. There just either ‘is’ or there ‘isn’t.’
",6
13095,SpongeBob,112," Patrick, if having a bunch of money makes me forget that forget that you’re my best friend, then I don’t want anymore money, ever again.
",6
13096,Patrick,112," Well, why didn’t you say so, buddy? I’ve been waiting for someone to go break in my new volleyball with!

[appears in the catapult] On second thought, bathroom attendants make me some tips. Well, look on the bright side, Squidward. No more living next door to SpongeBob. Let her rip, Jack-o!

13369,SpongeBob,114," Wait! [stops the hammer] You can't do that.

13378,SpongeBob,114," But, but I...
",6
13379,Blue Olaf,114," We're being attacked by a giant monster. This is the end, uh, the end, uh, of the Vikings!
",6
13380,Olaf,114," Oh, Vahalla. Why have you forsaken us?
",6
13381,SpongeBob,114," Guys, you just ran into a piece of ice. No one's forsaken you. There's a breach in the hull over there. You just gotta patch it up.
",6
13382,Gordon,114," [pulls out a blanket] Quick! Everybody take one of these!
",6
13383,SpongeBob,114," What's that for?
",6
13384,Gordon,114," It's a security blanket.

13385,SpongeBob,114," But, how ya gonna patch up a leak with that?

13386,Gordon,114," Ve're not. But it makes us feel so much better.

13389,SpongeBob,114," Pardon me, Squidward! [breaks the rope that was tying Squidward with his spatula]
",6
13390,Squidward,114," [sliding down the catapult] It's all yours.
",6
13391,SpongeBob,114," Thanks. [lassos a mast and the catapult turns] There.
",6
13392,Purple Olaf,114," Look up there! What's he doing?
",6
13393,SpongeBob,114," Here goes nothing! [throws his spatula at the pedal. The catapult launches him into the breech in the hull.. The ship straightens up, the vikings cheer]

",6
13402,Mailman,115," Sorry. No check. But I've got this. [gives Mr. Krabs a bottle and walks away]
",6
13403,Mr. Krabs,115," Oh, a correspondence in a bottle, eh? [reading] Ahoy, Eugene. I'm so proud you followed your ol' Grampa's peg leg and became a pirate, that I'll be sailing by for a ship's inspection. That vessel better be well-oiled or you'll be dancing the short plank jig. Happy looting! Grampa Redbeard! [not reading. Gasp!] Grandpa Readbeard comin bla, bla, bla!
",6
13404,SpongeBob,115," I didn't know your grandpa was a pirate, Mr. Krabs.
",6
13405,Mr. Krabs,115," Aye, I come from a whole family of pirates. Gramps used to say, ""The Krabs Clan has been pirates for as long as we've had claws."" And he wanted me to be a pirate, too.

13407,Grandpa Redbeard,115," [fighting pirate skeletons] One day, you'll be a plunderin' pirate just like yer ol' granddad here.
",6
13408,Mr. Krabs,115," So I bought me a ship, hired a crew.....
",6
13409,Crew member,115," Aaarrrrr!
",6
13410,Mr. Krabs,115," And for years, I drifted the high seas as a pirate. And booty did abound.
",6
13411,Crew members,115," [lined up to get paid]
",6
13412,Mr. Krabs,115," I started to notice a recurring fee. I just wasn't turning enough profit. So I fired me crew and sold me ship. ‘Twas also the last time I saw me granddad.

13414,Young Mr. Krabs,115," Well, actually, Grandpa,...I just sold...

",6
13416,Young Mr. Krabs,115," Yeah, uh, Grandpa...
",6
13417,Mr. Krabs,115," For all he knows, the Krusty Krab is a pirate ship. If he were to find out the truth, it would break his salty, barnacle encrusted heart. Boo-hoo!
",6
13418,SpongeBob,115," Why don't we just make the Krusty Krab look like a pirate ship.
",6
13419,Mr. Krabs,115," Hm. Not a bad idea, boy. But we're gonna need a first rate crew.
",6
13420,SpongeBob,115," We've got Squidward. And I could get Patrick to join up.
",6
13421,Mr. Krabs,115," Yeah.
",6
13422,Mr. Krabs,115," All right, me hearties! Get this one thing clear. If Grandpa Redbeard is ever gonna believe I'm a pirate, ye landlubbers are gonna have to pass as a pirate crew. Which means, I want you to look like a pirate. [puts a bandana on Squidward] I want you to talk like a pirate.
",6
13423,SpongeBob,115," Swarthy! I mean...shiver me timbers!
",6
13424,Mr. Krabs,115," But most importantly, I want you to smell like a pirate. [smells Patrick] Very convincing, Patrick. And as me crew, you'll be makin' the Krusty Krab into an imitation pirate ship! Now, let's get this restaurant ready to sail!
",6
13425,Mr. Krabs,115," [breaks the bar holding the tableabove the ground. He sticks it in the cash register for a steering wheel]

13443,Mr. Krabs,115," Oh, I...Heh, heh. So, have ya met me hearties?
",6
13444,Grandpa Redbeard,115," Hm...this might be a pirate crew. But more miserable jellyfishers than swarvy brine-skimmers.
",6
13445,SpongeBob,115," Um...

13446,Grandpa Redbeard,115," Har, har, har! I'm just yankin' yer chain, boy! You look like a fine pirate crew.

13452,Squidward,115," [hanging from the front of the ship and moving the pieces of cardboard he painted to make it look like waves]

13453,Patrick,115," [hanging from the window. He takes a drink of water and spits it on Grandpa Redbeard]
",6
13454,Mr. Krabs,115," Oh, that salty sea air be so thick, ya can almost taste it.
",6
13455,Grandpa Redbeard,115," Aye.
",6
13456,Mr. Krabs,115," I better take the helm and guide us to safer waters. Aye, that be a wicked soundin' wind out there, eh, Granddad? I said, ""Aye, that be a wicked soundin' wind out there!""
",6
13457,SpongeBob,115," Oh!! [turns on a record player. It makes wind noises]
",6
13458,Mr. Krabs,115," There it is! That wind storm I mentioned earlier, it...and, aparrently me cabin is haunted as well.
",6
13459,Grandpa Redbeard,115," [picks up a hair net] What's a hair net doin' on a pirate ship? Every pirate knows that the majority of his daily nutrition comes from whatever hair or skin flakes fall off the coke and into the stew. This hair net is deprivi' your crew of its essential nutrients.
",6
13460,Mr. Krabs,115," Uh, just a sec. [turns a video projector on] Look out, Grandpa! We're under attack! [The video projector shows a kraken emerging from the water]
",6
13461,Kraken,115," Grrrrrr....
",6
13462,Grandpa Redbeard,115," Aye, look at the size of that beast.
",6
13463,Mr. Krabs,115," Not to worry, Granddad. [grabs a harpoon]

13467,SpongeBob,115," [catches the harpoon]
",6
13468,Mr. Krabs,115," Oh, nothing. Look! [The video projector shows a harpoon landing on the Kraken and knocking him underwater]
",6
13469,Grandpa Redbeard,115," Har, har, har, har! That's me boy!
",6
13470,Mr. Krabs,115," Clear!

13471,SpongeBob and Patrick,115," Hooray!

13475,Squidward,115," You owe me big time, Mr. Krabs. [takes off his bandana and inflates his head]

13476,Mr. Krabs,115," Ar! Take that, ya, ya scurvy dog! Woo! Check the size of this, Granddad.[He is holding Squidward, who looks like the Kraken] Check the... Granddad?
",6
13477,Grandpa Redbeard,115," Ahoy! Trouble aproachin' quick! Approximately ten clips of the starboard bow! Man your battle stations!
",6
13478,Mr. Krabs,115," Oh no. If Granddad sees something, it must be the real deal.
",6
13479,Grandpa Redbeard,115," What have ya got, cotton in yer ears?! Move!

13480,SpongeBob,115," [stacks some bags of sand]
",6
13481,Patrick,115," [raises the Jolly Roger]

13482,Squidward,115," [reading a book]
",6
13483,Mr. Krabs,115," What exactly are we dealin' with, Grandpa?
",6
13484,Grandpa Redbeard,115," Somethin' bigger than I've ever seen! A ravin' garganst comin' by with coarsmatic tangled locks!
",6
13485,Mr. Krabs,115," [Gasp!] Oh, so depulsive.
",6
13486,Grandpa Redbeard,115," Yeah. It must be destroyed! Here, see for yourself. [gives Mr. Krabs a telescope]

13487,Mr. Krabs,115," Go get it, Granddad.

13488,Pearl,115," Daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad!

13495,Mr. Krabs,115," Nooooo! [puts out the fuse on the cannon]

13496,Grandpa Redbeard,115," What are ya doin'?
",6
13497,Mr. Krabs,115," Oh, I, oh, I was just checkin' the cannon and makin' sure it was loaded. [The cannon collapses]

13498,Grandpa Redbeard,115," What is this?!

13499,Mr. Krabs,115," I can explain.

13500,Pearl,115," Dad! Dad!

13501,Grandpa Redbeard,115," Now it's even more angry!

13502,Mr. Krabs,115," Don't worry! I have it under control! [jumps off the ship]

13503,Pearl,115," Daddy!

13504,Mr. Krabs,115," Pearl! Could ya pipe down? Your Great-Granddad Redbeard is in there!

13505,Pearl,115," What's with the lame outfit?

13506,Mr. Krabs,115," What? Oh, never mind that! [pushes Pearl away] Just go home. [climbs back up the ship]

13507,Grandpa Redbeard,115," [breaks a cardboard wave]

13514,Grandpa Redbeard,115," Arrrrrrrrrrrr! Arrrrrrrrrrrr!
",6
13515,Mr. Krabs,115," Now, Granddad. There's a simple explanation.
",6
13516,Grandpa Redbeard,115," I've smelled sticky things, but nothin' smells stckier than a lie! The code that all pirates live by, you knows what it is, don't ya?
",6
13517,Mr. Krabs,115," Of course I do, Granddad.
",6
13518,Grandpa Redbeard,115," Well, then, say it!

13519,Mr. Krabs,115," It's, it's, it's a pirate never lies! [starts crying] And I've been a dirty liar! Everything you see is a lie! This sail is a lie! [tears down the sail] This crew is a lie! [rips their pirate clothes, leaving SpongeBob, Patrick and Squidward, naked.] Even the ship is a lie! [takes a ball and breaks the roof of the ship, which made SpongeBob, Patrick & Squidward ran away. He destroys the whole ship, leaving the KK standing] All of it! All a lie!
",6
13520,Mr. Krabs,115," You see, Granddad? I'm no pirate. I'm just a lowly restaurant owner! I'm sorry I failed ye.
",6
13521,Grandpa Redbeard,115," Fail, me boy?! Ha, ha, ha! Why, I couldn't be more proud. Look at yer ludicrous prices! Now, that's real piracy. Ya done good, boy-o!

13522,Mr. Krabs,115," Really? Thanks, Granddad!
",6
13523,Grandpa Redbeard,115," Why, thank yourself, lad! You created this dynasty on yer own! Now, I'll be takin' me lead, boy!
",6
13524,Mr. Krabs,115," Goodbye, Granddad! What an honest man!
",6
13525,Grandpa Redbeard,115," [steals Mr. Krabs's money] I hope ya don't mind, boy-o, but I helped myself to a little bit of yer booty! [laughs]

13535,Mr. Krabs,116," [Squidward lowers his head back down again] Well... it's almost quittin' time, Squidward. You... got any big plans for after work? [Squidward licks his tentacle, and flips the page].
",6
13536,Squidward,116," Nope. [Mr. Krabs frowns at him and SpongeBob blinks. Mr. Krabs walks away and SpongeBob disappears from the window, then appears again next to Squidward at the cash register-boat. He blinks, and that is when Squidward notices him and squints at him, he starts grunting furiously].
",6
13537,SpongeBob,116," Hey, Squidward. [his voice is a little bit lower] Pretty incredible shift, huh?
",6
13538,Squidward,116," [sarcastically] If you say so.

13539,SpongeBob,116," Any plans after work?
",6
13540,Squidward,116," [annoyed] No.
",6
13541,SpongeBob,116," [relaxed voice] Yeah, me neither. Just gonna be hangin' at 'Casa de Esponja'. Feel free to drop by if you're in the neighborhood. [giggles] [Squidward disappears, leaving his work hat and his book, Art, behind. The scene cuts and Squidward is seen walking away from the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob follows after him].
",6
13542,SpongeBob,116," Hey, Squidward. Wait up! Squidward! I realized I really didn't extend a proper invitation back there. [holds out his hand] So what do ya say, Squidward? How about you come over to my house for a visit tonight? [Squidward says nothing. SpongeBob pokes him]. Squidward? [pokes him again. his voice is a little bit louder] Squidward? [pokes him again] Squidward? [pokes him once more] Squidward? [Squidward stops walking, and SpongeBob walks right into him. He backs up a few spaces].
",6
13543,Squidward,116," SpongeBob, thank you so much for that lovely invitation but I must respectfully tell you I will never visit you. [yells] Ever! [his yell blows SpongeBob away. A chicken clucking is heard, and Squidward walks away. Squidward sighs] Take heart, Squidward, it'll all be over soon. [he stops to see SpongeBob sobbing and holding onto his leg].
",6
13544,SpongeBob,116," [sobbing into a puddle] Oh, please come over for a visit, Squidward! [his eyes turn into giant black circles with three giant holes in them] It's been so long! I can't even remember your last visit! [He keeps on crying]
",6
13545,Squidward,116," That's probably because I've never visited you.
",6
13546,SpongeBob,116," [sobbing] Please? Please? Please?! [Squidward is at the bus stop] Please?! Please?! [bus comes up, and when it leaves, the puddles from SpongeBob's crying are still there.

",6
13550,SpongeBob,116," What if I got a couple of throw pillows?
",6
13551,SpongeBob,116," [cuts to the outside of Conch Street. The camera keeps on slowly zooming in on SpongeBob's house. Next, the camera is inside SpongeBob's house where he and Patrick are putting together a puzzle]. Patrick? Has Squidward ever visited you at home? [Patrick is trying to work two pieces of a puzzle with are both two shades of green together. The camera immediately goes to the next clip which is directly on Patrick]
",6
13552,Patrick,116," Only once. To take back some stuff I borrowed. [The clip goes to SpongeBob whose finger is on a puzzle piece in a light shade of green and who is moving it back and forth]
",6
13553,SpongeBob,116," He said he wouldn't leave the comfort of his own home for my ""dirty little hovel"".
",6
13554,Patrick,116," [holding some glue, possibly puzzle glue. He glues it on a puzzle piece spilling lots of it onto the table] Borrow something, and he'll have to come over to get it back.

See ya later! [he goes outside, SpongeBob snaps his fingers]
",6
13555,SpongeBob,116," That's it!
",6
13556,Squidward,116," [from inside] A stick of butter, and just a touch of pepper... [Squidward is at his table cooking, pouring salt.] Dya—ah! [hammering on nails is heard, surprising Squidward, causing the pepper to fly up in the air, and to land in one of Squidward's plants. As it tilts, some of the pepper spills onto the rug] Not on the rug! [Goes to his window and opens it up] SpongeBob! Will you keep it down? I am trying to cook! [The window to SpongeBob's house opens, and there is SpongeBob holding a hammer]
",6
13557,SpongeBob,116," Oh, hey, Squidward! Just doin' a little home improvement.

[laughs each time the camera zooms on Squidward's face. Cuts to SpongeBob's house, SpongeBob hits his desk, and the telephone flies up in the air, and lands in SpongeBob's hand. SpongeBob is in a relaxed mood.]
",6
13562,SpongeBob,116," SquarePants residence. [Squidward's red phone is seen]
",6
13563,Squidward,116," Why do you have my vacuum cleaner?
",6
13564,SpongeBob,116," [excited] Squidward! [wiggles fingers] It's been a while since I last got a call from my favorite next-door neighbor! [Squidward slaps his head]
",6
13565,Squidward,116," [angered] That's because I've never called you! Now, why have you stolen my vacuum cleaner?
",6
13566,SpongeBob,116," I didn't steal it, silly, I borrowed it.
",6
13567,Squidward,116," Are you done cleaning up that dingy hole you call home?
",6
13568,SpongeBob,116," [excited] You won't even recognize the place, Squidward! [gasps excitedly]
",6
13569,Squidward,116," Yeah, probably not. [SpongeBob keeps on gasp-like panting. Goes to the window between Squidward's and SpongeBob's houses who are looking at each other by their windows] I'll be over to get my vacuum in twenty minutes. [slams the window shut]
",6
13570,SpongeBob,116," Oh, Squidward is finally coming over for a visit! [goes to Squidward putting a casserole in the oven, mumbling in anger]
",6
13571,SpongeBob,116," [Cuts to the next scene. Squidward is knocking on SpongeBob's door.  The door opens to see SpongeBob. The inside of his house is seen dark green with SpongeBob smiling] Squidward! I've been expecting you! Welcome to my humble abode! I hope that you will find comfort. And please don't hesitate to ask me if there's anything I can... [Squidward pushes SpongeBob out of the way, mumbling softly]
",6
13572,Squidward,116," I just want my vacuum back... [with a shocked look on his face] You've made an exact replica of my living room! [camera pans left to right revealing everything in Squidward's house]
",6
13573,SpongeBob,116," [Squidward's mouth drops wide open] Well, you said you wouldn't leave the comfort of my home, [puts out his hands] so I brought the comfort here! [louder voice] Isn't it great?! [SpongeBob laughs, Squidward gets angry]
",6
13574,Squidward,116," [yelling] No! It isn't! You can't just steal my decorating style, and... [slaps his face, and rubs his tentacle down it] Never mind. Just give me my vacuum. [Ignoring Squidward, SpongeBob holds up a cup of iced tea with a blue bendy straw, a lemon, and a pink umbrella]
",6
13575,SpongeBob,116," Would you care for a cool and refreshing iced tea? [Squidward throws it down]
",6
13576,Squidward,116," No. [SpongeBob holds another dish up]
",6
13577,SpongeBob,116," Hot hors d'oeuvres? [Squidward throws it down]
",6
13578,Squidward,116," No. [holds another dish up]
",6
13579,SpongeBob,116," Nachos? [Squidward throws it down]
",6
13580,Squidward,116," No. [SpongeBob holds another dish up]
",6
13581,SpongeBob,116," Blancmange?
",6
13582,Squidward,116," I-I don't even know that that is! [throws it down] Please just give me my vacuum so I can get back home. I have a casserole in the oven!
",6
13583,SpongeBob,116," [raises his finger, still ignoring Squidward] Yes, of course. [brings Squidward to the couch] Please take a seat while I go grab your vacuum. [pats it] Please make yourself at home! [Squidward mumbles in anger as SpongeBob fluffs a pillow] Enjoying your visit so far, Squidwar...?
",6
13584,Squidward,116," This is not a visit. You are going to get my vacuum. [grabs the pillow SpongeBob is fluffing from him] And stop fluffing this pillow!
",6
13585,SpongeBob,116," Okay, Squidward, just yell if you need anything. [walks away]
",6
13586,Squidward,116," Imbecile.
",6
13587,Squidward,116," [gasps] How did he do it? [pans across Squidward's coffee table] He got my coffee table, my vase, snack table, coasters, and my Art of the Clarinet Coffee Table Book. [he picks up the pillow SpongeBob was fluffing] And this pillow looks just like the one Mommy made for me. He even copied her stitch signature! ""For Squiddy, with love, Mama."" [yells, SpongeBob appears out of nowhere, a few bubbles appear]
",6
13588,SpongeBob,116," You yelled?
",6
13589,Squidward,116," [angry] Never mind. I'll find the vacuum myself! [puts down the pillow and walks away]
",6
13590,SpongeBob,116," Then okay! Make yourself at home! Squidward sure seems to be enjoying his visit.
",6
13591,Squidward,116," [peeks through an entrance in the hallway] My hallway... [blinks as he sees a dent in the wall] Dear Neptune! [shivers, shudders, sweats and blinks] He even got the chip in the paint from when I moved in! [he shudderly walks down the hallway] Okay, Squiddy. Don't get creeped out. Just get the vacuum cleaner and go home. [opens a door] Oh, right. Isn't this neat? My bathroom. [he flushes the toilet, and water comes out like a fountain. He walks over to the sink] I have to give him credit, though.Every detail is correct. [opens the medicine cabinet] How does he know the exact contents of my medicine cabinet? [his eyes grow at his rash cream] My rash cream?? [closes the cabinet] That little sneak! [he screams as SpongeBob appears]
",6
13592,SpongeBob,116," Did someone say ""rash cream?"" [Squidward runs into the wall, making some of the cream jump out of the bottle]
",6
13593,Squidward,116," [holding his nose] SpongeBob, you idiot!
",6
13594,SpongeBob,116," Squidward, the rash cream. [Squidward keeps slips on the rash cream and falls causing more rash cream to come out of the bottle] Oops. [Squidward comes out wearing his shower curtain over his head, and slips on the rash cream which causes more rash cream to come out] Oh, no! [Squidward has a drawer stuck in his neck, and he slips on the rash cream once more, and his head falls right into his toilet. The lid then falls and flushes. SpongeBob walks right toward him] I don't think I have a cream for that.
",6
13595,Squidward,116," [sleeping on a pillow on the couch his Mom made for him. He then wakes up, and gasps, looking both ways, then sighs peacefully] Oh, what a horrible nightmare. [SpongeBob pops up from behind the couch]
",6
13596,SpongeBob,116," So, are you enjoying your stay at 'Chez Spongè?' [Squidward screams rocking the entire house. SpongeBob's house is now nervous with its teeth showing]
",6
13597,Squidward,116," Guh... will you excuse me for a moment? I need to use the bathroom again. [SpongeBob points at him, and winks at him]
",6
13598,SpongeBob,116," Tsk. [Squidward walks through a door] Hurry back, Squidward! [Squidward shuts the door]
",6
13599,Squidward,116," [sweating] I gotta find that vacuum and get out of here! [he runs up some stairs to another hallway]
",6
13600,Squidward,116," [opens the door to the hallway] He copied all 492 of my self-portraits... [camera directs on three of them individually] ...and they're better than mine! [sits down on the rug] He even got the rug right. Get a hold of yourself, Squiddy, old bean. This doesn't mean anything. [touches the rug] This...all of this is just... [smiles] Mimicry! He doesn't possess your style, or your decorating acumen, or your love of the finer things. In fact, the only thing that he has is... is... my vacuum cleaner! And I'll remedy that... [walks over to a closet] posthaste! [he opens the door to see the things SpongeBob usually has in his house along with his vacuum cleaner, Squidward gasps] A-ha! He put you in here along with all his bad tastes! You're coming home... [he pulls on the vacuum without success, grunts and pulls on it harder] Home... with me... with me... [it finally comes out along with everything else, and Squidward yells as it all collapses on him]
",6
13601,Patrick,116," You just missed the fire. [Squidward walks to the firemen]
",6
13602,Squidward,116," What happened to my house? [fireman holds up a burnt casserole]
",6
13603,Fireman,116," Oh, some knucklehead left a casserole in the oven.
",6
13604,Squidward,116," SpongeBob!
",6
13605,SpongeBob,116," Aw, don't worry, Squidward. You're more than welcome to stay at my home until you get your house fixed. [Squidward becomes shocked with ominous music playing, he suddenly disappears to him at a table with his vacuum cleaner at the seat across from him]
",6
13606,Squidward,116," Why, yes, I'd love another spot of tea, Mr. Vacuum Cleaner. [holds up the burnt casserole] Care for some casserole?? [crazed laughter. Camera zooms in on his pupil, and he reappears to the real life]
",6
13607,SpongeBob,116," Squidward? You okay? Squidward? [Squidward faints] Squidward! [camera zooms out to see the burnt house with the fireman hosing again.]
",6
13608,Squidward,116,"  Ah... Replica, sweet replica.
",6
13609,SpongeBob,116," It sure was nice having Squidward over for a visit, eh, Gary? [he goes to sleep. While snoring, his sheet turns to ashes]

13842,SpongeBob,118," Oh, he likes you.
",6
13843,Mr. Krabs,118," [very angry] Get that disgusting vermin out of me restaurant, pronto! [SpongeBob is shocked by this reaction, and runs out of the Krusty Krab sobbing] Blech! [bubble transition to the back of the Krusty Krab]
",6
13844,SpongeBob,118," [inside a garbage can with the worms, depressed] Oh, well. At least I still have you guys. [gets sprayed on by the worms as a garbage truck drives up and stops]
",6
13845,Garbage Fish #1,118," Hmm... [removes some goo from SpongeBob's face with two fingers and sniffs it]
",6
13846,Garbage Fish #2,118," What is it?
",6
13847,Garbage Fish #1,118," I'd recognize this goo anywhere. It comes from a baby spotted glistening meadow worm, the rarest of its species.
",6
13848,Garbage Fish #2,118," Dude, those things are worth a fortune.
",6
13849,Mr. Krabs,118," Did you say ""fortune?"" [His eyes show dollar symbols] [later, Mr. Krabs is talking through a megaphone and trying to sell worms] $5.99, that's right. Get them while they last. Don't be shy, folks.

13850,Female fish,118," These things are so cute! [hands some money to Mr. Krabs and receives back a worm]

13855,SpongeBob,118," What's that?

13923,Squidward,119," Your feet however are clean. Think about it. Your feet have been protected by your shoes and socks all day.
",6
13924,SpongeBob,119," Oh! [he takes his shoe and sock off, then we see a close-up of his foot with a band-aid, and blisters]. It's all coming clear to me now. [cut to the next scene where SpongeBob is walking on his hands and serving a customer with his feet, on one foot there is a Krabby Patty, and on his other foot there is a drink] There you are. A nice hot meal with sanitary foot service. Here's a nice delicious Krabby Patty, and a large drink. [he puts a straw in the drink by using his toes, then he bends the straw with his big toe, the customer flinches] Enjoy.

13935,SpongeBob,119," There's another secret? What's the secret?

13945,SpongeBob,119," One Krusty Krab, covered in mud and slime!
",6
13946,Squidward,119," Mmm, you missed a spot.
",6
13947,SpongeBob,119," Got it! [SpongeBob chews gum and spits it on the bottom of the tables] Gum under all the tables! How's that for low expectations?

13953,SpongeBob,119," Squidward, all the customers are leaving!
",6
13954,Squidward,119," What did we talk about?
",6
13955,SpongeBob,119," Don't touch the material.
",6
13956,Squidward,119," If you want the customers to stay, you need to provide some entertainment!

",6
13962,Mr. Krabs,119," Ah, there's nothing like polished pincers to make you feel like a man! [he laughs at his own reflection in them] Let's see how SpongeBob's doing as acting manager. [he goes in through the door and is shocked at what he finds] What the...?! SpongeBob dancing like a goofball?

",6
13980,SpongeBob,120," That's because this is my work hat, Patrick. I have to wear it when I go to work.
",6
13981,Patrick,120," Why don't you just take it off so you don't have to go to work today?
",6
13982,SpongeBob,120," [laughs] I'm afraid it doesn't work that way, buddy.

",6
13992,Mr. Krabs,120," You'll get your hat, but first you have to entice people into the restaurant by standin' right here and holdin' this sign. [Mr. Krabs hands Patrick an arrow-shaped sign saying ""The Krusty Krab""] That's not too tough for ya, is it boy?
",6
13993,Patrick,120," Sounds complicated, but if it gets me a work hat. [Holds up the sign] How's this?
",6
13994,Mr. Krabs,120," Perfect. You'll be wearin' that hat in no time at all. [From inside the Krusty Krab] Hee hee hee.

13999,Harold,120," Can you direct me to the Krusty Krab please? [Patrick holds the sign so it's pointing at the Chum Bucket. Harold runs into the Chum Bucket.]
",6
14000,Mr. Krabs,120," What does he think he's doing?! [Multiple fish walk past Patrick] They're walkin' right past him. [Runs outside to Patrick] Patrick, you need to get their attention, boy.
",6
14001,Patrick,120," Okay. [Hits a fish in the head with the sign]
",6
14002,Mr. Krabs,120," That ain't the kind of attention we need! Why don't you show a little razzle-dazzle, maybe give the sign a little twirl or something. [Spins the sign, causing it to fly out of Patrick's hands. Hands the sign back to Patrick] Just keep workin' on that one, eh boy? Listen, if any tourists come by, why don't you blow them away with a little extra twirl.
",6
14003,Patrick,120," Any thing for my new hat.
",6
14004,Mr. Krabs,120," That's enough Patrick!

",6
14011,SpongeBob,120," What's the matter, Patrick?
",6
14012,Patrick,120," Sometimes when I'm nervous, I forget how to stand!
",6
14013,SpongeBob,120," He's nervous.
",6
14014,Blue Fish,120," Ha ha! Look at that guy! He can't even stand on his own two feet!

14015,Pink Fish,120," Now that's that kind of mindlessness I'd pay money to see!

14020,Patrick,120," I did?
",6
14021,Mr. Krabs,120," That's right, I think we've finally found a job for you that you're good at. Being an absolute buffoon! If it's folly you crave, it can be found exclusively at the Krusty Krab. For just five dollars a head.
",6
14022,Squidward,120," It's official. [everyone is still laughing] I hate everyone. [Patrick falls into the kitchen] You imbeciles think that's entertainment? Brace yourself for true entertainment! [plays on clarinet off-key]

14028,Mr. Krabs,120," What the barnacles is going on out here?
",6
14029,Squidward,120," I'm entertaining those heathens.
",6
14030,Mr. Krabs,120," We've got all the entertainment we need, thank you very much! [points to Patrick, but he's not there] Hey, where'd he go?
",6
14031,SpongeBob,120," [guiding Patrick, who has tissue in his nose] That's buddy. Come on.
",6
14032,Mr. Krabs,120," What's with him?
",6
14033,SpongeBob,120," Patrick had a bloody nose, so I was going to walk him home.
",6
14034,Mr. Krabs,120," A bloody nose, eh? Do ya think I was born yesterday? He doesn't even have a nose. Now everybody, get back to work! I'm Not Running A Happy Factory Here [SpongeBob, Squidward, and Patrick get back into there positions. to Patrick] keep up the good work, Patrick!

14043,Harold,120," This guy's act is stale! We crave excitement!
",6
14044,Mr. Krabs,120," You want excitement? Well, what if I added a box? [puts Patrick on a box and he falls from it]
",6
14045,Billy,120," Sort of the same thing, really.
",6
14046,Mr. Krabs,120," Well, what if he fell from two boxes...? [adds another box, but the customers are still bored] ...into cream pie? [puts creme pie in place]

",6
14053,SpongeBob,120," Patrick? Patrick, are you all right? Say something! [Patrick mumbles incoherently] OK, that's it! No best friend of mine is going to suffer permanent brain trauma just so Mr Krabs can make a quick buck. I'm going to go have a talk with him right -
",6
14054,Patrick,120," [Grabs SpongeBob] No! P-please, don't tell Mr. Krabs! You don't understand. For years people have been telling me, “You're no good!” Now I'm good! I have a hat to prove it! I don't wanna go back to being No Hat Patrick! [He cries]
",6
14055,SpongeBob,120," OK, buddy, I understand. Just promise me one thing.
",6
14056,Patrick,120," What's that, pal?
",6
14057,SpongeBob,120," Just be careful, hm?
",6
14058,Patrick,120," [Hugs him] Thanks pal.
",6
14059,SpongeBob,120," I'm worried about Patrick. I'm not sure his new job is good for him. [Enters the Krusty Krabs, where Mr. Krabs is dressed in a suit and speaking through a megaphone]

",6
14063,Patrick,120," [Being hauled to top of the platform] Hi, SpongeBob.
",6
14064,SpongeBob,120," Mr Krabs, you can't let him do this, he might get hurt!
",6
14065,Mr. Krabs,120," It's OK, boy, he signed a waiver. [Shows it to him] Is he ready, Mr Squidward?
",6
14066,Squidward,120," Ready!
",6
14067,Mr. Krabs,120," OK! Get back, boy, you wouldn’t want to stain your uniform.
",6
14068,Patrick,120," Hey, good idea. Hey, Squidward, could you hold me hat so it won't get hurt? [gives hat to Squidward] Thanks buddy.

",6
14073,Mr. Krabs,120," Come on, Patrick! We've got a perfectly good bucket of spiny sea urchins down here!
",6
14074,Patrick,120," I'm trying!
",6
14075,Patrick,120," Argh, I think I'm stuck!
",6
14076,Mr. Krabs,120," Stuck? Well if that don't … [Mumbles angrily and climbs a ladder to the platform] What's the hold up, Mr. Squidward?
",6
14077,Squidward,120," Don't look at me, I'm just here to hold his hat.
",6
14078,Mr. Krabs,120," Patrick, why have you stopped falling?
",6
14079,Patrick,120," I dunno, Mr. Krabs.
",6
14080,Mr. Krabs,120," Well you'd better figure it out. These people paid good money for a floor show full of pain and humiliation. Now make with the cods-wallop, pal, understand?
",6
14081,Patrick,120," Uh huh.
",6
14082,Mr. Krabs,120," Don't make me come back here.
",6
14083,Patrick,120," Hey, Squidward, d'you think you could, uh, you know … [Mimes pushing]
",6
14084,Squidward,120," You want me to push you off your precarious perch into a bucket of spiny sea urchins? Oh, if only you were SpongeBob. OK, I'll do it! [He charges at Patrick but misses and falls]
",6
14085,Patrick,120," Thanks, Squidward! Oh, my hat. Gotcha! All right, back where you beloooong, aaaah! [Grabs hat puts it on and falls].
",6
14086,Harold,120," Great, we get to see two for the price of one!
",6
14087,Mr. Krabs,120," I don't think so.
",6
14088,Harold,120," Fine. [Pays Mr. Krabs]
",6
14089,Mr. Krabs,120," Thank you.
",6
14090,Patrick,120," Look, Squidward, I'm falling!
",6
14091,Squidward,120," Oh, I'm so happy for you!
",6
14092,Patrick,120," I figured it out; it's the hat that makes me fall, it makes me top heavy!
",6
14093,SpongeBob,120," So it was your hat that was making you fall the whole time!
",6
14094,Nat,120," I paid to see two guys get maimed.
",6
14095,Harold,120," Yeah, I want a refund.
",6
14096,Mr. Krabs,120," Sorry, absolutely no refunds. [customers grumble] Hold on there, what's the big idea? [Customers tear up his clothes and money flies in the air] Grandma, help! [he is in his underwear] All right, you leave me no choice.
",6
14097,Patrick,120," You're giving me a raise.
",6
14098,Mr. Krabs,120," Not even close, you're fired. As long as I'm still standing, you will never wear this hat again!
",6
14099,SpongeBob,120," Patrick, you OK?
",6
14100,Patrick,120," Well, I guess it's back to being to no hat pat! [cries]
",6
14101,Narrator,120," Epilogue.
",6
14102,SpongeBob,120," [Walking home with Patrick] It's OK, Patrick, not everyone is equipped to bear the awesome weight of responsibility that a uniform hat represents. But you can wear mine any time you want.
",6
14103,Patrick,120," Really?
",6
14104,SpongeBob,120," Sure thing, pal.
",6

",6
14159,Patrick,121," ['looks at his plans] Now this'll show SpongeBob that he's not the only one who can build a castle! Let's see SpongeBob destroy this castle! [builds a castle with spikes on top and a skull and crossbones symbol on the door]
",6
14160,SpongeBob,121," [After seeing Patrick's new castle] I better build a wall just in case King Pinky gets any funny ideas. [starts building a wall but then notices that Patrick's castle is over the borderline] Oh sir, you built onto my side.
",6
14161,Patrick,121," So?
",6
14162,SpongeBob,121," [mad] So, you don't do that!!! [ chops off the portion of Patrick's castle that is crossing] There! That restores the integrity of our shared border.
",6
14163,Patrick,121," You tyrant! You've done it again! I'll show you what for! [Builds a hammer out of sand and charges toward SpongeBob's castle]
",6

",6
14165,Patrick,121," [attacks SpongeBob's castle, completely destroying it] Now we're even... again!

[Patrick signs SpongeBob's sand made treaty] Patrick, by signing this historic armistice you have brought peace to our lands. May your kingdom prosper! Well that went well!"" [Patrick shoots a sand arrow at SpongeBob's castle] What are you doing!? What about the treaty!?

Patrick screams as the sand rocks from SpongeBob's catapult hurl toward him destroying Patrick's army. SpongeBob laughs and blows another horn. SpongeBob's army emerges from his castle and charges toward Patrick. Patrick screams again. SpongeBob's army starts to ram down the door to Patrick's castle. Patrick panics and builds a cannon. SpongeBob's army breaks the door] Oh hello! And goodbye. [pulls cannon's string. SpongeBob's army rushes in his castle away from the cannonball]

14172,SpongeBob,121," Come on! [closes the door to his castle] How do you like them apples [Cannonball goes over the wall and destroys the army]

14173,Patrick,121," [laughs from atop his castle] You'll never win! Do you hear me!?

14174,SpongeBob,121," [now inside a high tech sand castle] Uh huh... mmm hmm. Well put general! We'll create a surprise military diversion and break through enemy lines. What say you? [Sand constructed general starts to fall apart] Yes! We'll ready ourselves immediately! [builds a tank that then crashes through his own castle and towards Patrick's] How do you like me now?

14175,Patrick,121," [has a robot already built that punches through his own castle] I like you this much! [picks up SpongeBob's tank with SpongeBob screaming inside] Feel me!

14176,SpongeBob,121," [screams again. He presses a button in his tank blowing up Patrick's robot. He emerges from his tank and sees Patrick inside his robot head] Patrick... Patrick! Are you okay!?
",6
14177,Patrick,121," [quietly] The question is... will you be!? [presses a button in his robot head. The robot flies into the air with SpongeBob still hanging on. SpongeBob looks down and sees how high up he is. He then slips and falls through the sky. Then he pulls a sand parachute and laughs] No fair!

As the winds of time changed the silvery sands of these dunes to a new landscape, so let us hope that our own winds of change will change our spiritual dunes to a landscape of peace. Oh buddy, let's never forget this lesson. [SpongeBob and Patrick hug]

",6
14355,Security Guard,124," Uh huh. [The security guard starts to leave, but then realizes who Patchy is.] Oh. You're here for the Casting Department.

14372,Gary,124," [Angrily] Meow.
",6
14373,SpongeBob,124," A little overboard? And take a chance at being late for the single most greatest day of my career. [The shot widens and a thought bubble appears. It shows The Krusty Krab.] The eleventy-seventh anniversary of the Krusty Krab. [SpongeBob leans near Gary and shakes his head.] Oh, oh, oh, I think not. [He returns to his previous position.] No self-respecting Krusty Krab employee would be late on this day. 
",6
14374,Squidward,124," [Off-Screen] What the?
",6
14375,Gary,124," [Snidely] Meow, Meow, Meow.
",6
14376,SpongeBob,124," Oh, Watch the potty mouth, Gare. Today is a day for gentle reflection. Aw, I remember my first visit to The Krusty Krab.
",6
14377,Harold SquarePants,124," I don't know. This doesn't seem like a family restaurant.
",6
14378,Margaret SquarePants,124," Oh. [The scene widens to reveal that she is pregnant with SpongeBob] Well, what do you think, baby? Should we eat here? [The scene moves to show the inside of Margaret's womb. SpongeBob swims off-screen. The scene returns to show Margaret. She is moves inside to the front of the cash register boat.] Well, Okay, then. [The scene returns to the womb and SpongeBob is next to Margaret's belly button which looks like a window. Margaret's voice is echoing.] What would you like?

14380,SpongeBob,124," [Singing voice-over]
",6
14381,Patchy,124," Security, more shrimp cocktail in Casting, please. Thank you. 
",6
14382,Devil Potty,124," Look, Patchy, a Rolodex. Why, it's probably full of celebrity phone numbers. You don't need SpongeBob. You can call them yourself. Go on, have a look. Squawk.
",6
14383,Angel Potty,124," That's private property, Patchy. If you get caught looking at it, we'll never get to meet SpongeBob.
",6
14384,Patchy,124," Yeah, good point.
",6
14385,Devil Potty,124," Don't listen to him. You want your TV show to have big-name guests, don't you?
",6
14386,Patchy,124," Yeah. No. I mean...
",6
14387,Devil Potty,124," Then do it.
",6
14388,Angel Potty,124," Don't do it, Patchy.
",6
14389,Devil Potty,124," Come on. Do it! Do it!
",6
14390,Patchy,124," I shall. [He takes the Rolodex. The Potties leave.] Let's see, Dawson, Richard. Rosario. Rosario Dawson! She'll bring a little class to the show.

14396,Patchy,124," show-tacular, and I need a little celebrity wind in my sail, so to speak.
",6
14397,Rosario Dawson,124," Okay. You need a little mouthwash is what you need.
",6
14398,Patchy,124," I was wondering if you'd like to be my special guest.

14408,Patchy,124," This is Patchy the Pirate.
",6
14409,Triumph,124," Oh. Don't give me that Patchy stuff. Come on, Depp, I know it's you. Drop the pirate thing.
",6
14410,Patchy,124," You know, I do get that a lot, but seriously, it's not Johnny Depp.
",6
14411,Triumph,124," Come on. Who is this? The pirate from the cereal box or the litter box.
",6
14412,Patchy,124," The one from Encino. It's Patchy, president of the SpongeBob SquarePants Fan Club.
",6
14413,Triumph,124," Oh, the president. Well, your mother must be so proud.
",6
14414,Triumph,124," Listen, Scratchy.
",6
14415,Patchy,124," It's Patchy
",6
14416,Triumph,124," You know, Catchy, maybe you should consider wearing two eye patches. That way, you won't be able to see what's become of your life.
",6
14417,Patchy,124," What?
",6
14418,Triumph,124," So, what are you tell me, what are you selling, besides your dignity and self-respect?
",6
14419,Patchy,124," None of the above. I was wondering if you'd like to be a guest on the big TV special. That I am throwing for SpongeBob.
",6
14420,Triumph,124," Sorry, Poop-Leg Pete. I'm a big star. I don't do basic cable. I'm on a major network. Kind of.
",6
14421,Patchy,124," It would sure mean a lot to be personally if you'd be on my show, Triumph.
",6
14422,Triumph,124," Oh, it would mean a lot. Well, why didn't you say so? That changes everything.
",6
14423,Patchy,124," Oh.
",6
14424,Triumph,124," You know, I'd love to be on your show. I'd love it as much as I love pulling ticks off my butt.
",6
14425,Patchy,124," Well, fine. Who needs you, you filthy mongrel? 
",6
14426,Triumph,124," Okay, Captain Loser. Send me a script.
",6
14427,Patchy,124," Great! So, you'll be on my show?
",6
14428,Triumph,124," Sure, of course. I'm sure that it's a great script. Three, two, one. For me to poop on!
",6
14429,Patchy,124," Oh, yeah, well, I'll have you know, you are not the biggest star to tell me that. Hello? Hello?
",6
14430,Harold,124," Hey, hey. Chill out, buddy. We all want to get into the Krusty Krab as much as you do.

14439,SpongeBob,124," Sorry, everybody, but Mr. Krabs needs me. [More fish make annoyed noises. Once SpongeBob reaches the end, the scene changes to the interior of The Krusty Krab. The scene shows several fish waiting on the door. SpongeBob Squeezes himself through the cracked between the doors and the ground. He enters The Krusty Krab. He lands in the arms of Mr. Krabs.] Reporting for duty, sir.

",6
14441,SpongeBob,124," Happy eleventy-seventh, Squidward.
",6
14442,Mr. Krabs,124," [Walking past the table] Today's a big a day for The Krusty Krab. [Mr, Krabs ends up at a button.] So I want yous to listen up. [He pushes the button. It causes a shield to go around The Krusty Krab.] It's a perfect opportunity for Plankton to try and steal the Krabby Patty formula. 
",6
14443,Mr. Krabs,124," No. It's a holographic projection of The Krusty Krab. I want you two to watch all the entrances.
",6
14444,Squidward,124," You mean the front door and the back door?
",6
14445,Mr. Krabs,124," Those are just the ones on the surface. [The hologram expands to show the duct work.] There is an entire network of tunnels and air ducts underground and I want all eyes on the look out!
",6
14446,SpongeBob,124," Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs.
",6
14447,Mr. Krabs,124," Right. Study the map, stay extra vigilant. Don't fall asleep on the job. That means you, Squidward.
",6
14448,Squidward,124," What? I have never fallen asleep on duty.
",6
14449,Mr. Krabs,124," Don't make me have a flashback.
",6
14450,Squidward,124," All right, point taken.
",6
14451,Mr. Krabs,124," And to help watch out for Plankton, I've hired some extra security.
",6
14452,Squidward,124," [While Patrick is walking to them] You hired Patrick?
",6
14453,Mr. Krabs,124," What, you expect me to spend money on a real security guard? You are my first line of defense, Patrick. So, look out for any suspiciorous characters.
",6
14454,Patrick,124," [No longer having an angry face. Saluting.] Yes, sir. [Patrick surveys the area. He sees Squidward and pushes him to the wall] Who are you? And Who are you working for?!
",6
14455,Mr. Krabs,124," Plankton doesn't stand a chance.
",6
14456,Plankton,124," [As it is still panning in] It's a conspiracy, I tell you! A thousand and three times I've almost had that recipe, and a thousand and three times I've been launched by that Krabs! He celebrates eleventy-seven years of success, [The scene changes to show a medium shot of Plankton at his desk.] I'm left with four score and forty fortnights of failure! [The scene changes to show a closer shot of Plankton. He tears up.] I give up, Karen. Krabs has won!
",6
14457,Karen,124," [Off-Screen] Well, you'll never get the formula with that attitude. [On-Screen] Maybe a thousand and four will be your lucky number.
",6
14458,Plankton,124," Oh, yeah? You try getting launched.
",6
14459,Karen,124," Oh, right, the launchings. [Her face is replace by a loading bar and the word ""accessing"" above it.] I've got them all on my hard drive.
",6
14460,Mr. Krabs,124," Fore!
",6
14461,Plankton,124," Ow!
",6
14462,Mr. Krabs,124," I'm tired today, Plankton. [He drops Plankton.] You're just gonna have to launch yourself.
",6
14463,Plankton,124," Splat. 
",6
14464,Plankton,124," Karen?!
",6
14465,Karen,124," I'm sorry. That last part always makes me laugh.
",6
14466,Plankton,124," It's just no use!
",6
14467,Karen,124," [Off-Screen] Today's the [On-Screen] perfect day to steal the recipe. Krabs will be completely distracted by all the festivities. You can do this.
",6
14468,Plankton,124," You really think so?
",6
14469,Karen,124," Of course, I do. Now who's my big man?
",6
14470,Plankton,124," Oh, Karen.
",6
14471,Karen,124," Come on. Come on. Who's my big strong man?
",6
14472,Plankton,124," I am.
",6
14473,Karen,124," That's right. Now get out there and steal that recipe.
",6
14474,Plankton,124," [Saluting Karen] Yes, Ma'am!

A title card appears that reads, ""Patchy the Pirate's World of Rare and Rejected SpongeBob Clips"". SpongeBob appears on the film next to an image of SpongeBob on an easel.] Hello, children.

[An image of a pirate captain about to hit another pirate with a bucket is shown.] and fear. [Footage of a ship shooting is shown] Back then, pirates were serious business.

14912,SpongeBob,125," All ready to go jellyfishing today?

14913,Patrick,125," No. Just kidding!
",6
14914,SpongeBob,125," I see you even brought your double net.
",6
14915,Patrick,125," Yep. It's three times as fun.
",6
14916,SpongeBob,125," Um, Patrick? Don't you mean twice as fun?
",6
14917,Patrick,125," What is?
",6
14918,SpongeBob,125," Your— never mind.
",6
14919,Patrick,125," Oh, SpongeBob, That reminds me. We should probably check the weather report before we go.
",6
14920,SpongeBob,125," Good idea.
",6
14921,TV Reporter,125," And now the weather.
",6
14922,SpongeBob,125," Here we go.

14923,Phil Preflemuster,125," Thank you, Phil. Today's weather forecast calls for— [a piece of paper is given] A horrible storm will ravage the Bikini Bottom area.
",6
14924,Patrick and SpongeBob,125," A horrible storm?
",6
14925,Phil Preflemuster,125," You heard me. Panic is not advised although it is recommended. Also, an advisory has been issued to avoid any and all jellyfishing if possible.
",6
14926,SpongeBob,125," Patrick, help me get these boards nailed up.
",6
14927,Patrick,125," SpongeBob, this seems like a strange time to start decorating.
",6
14928,SpongeBob,125," Start dec— you sir, obviously do not recognize fine decorating when you see it.
",6
14929,Patrick,125," Hmm.
",6
14930,SpongeBob,125," Admire it later, Patrick. Right now, we got to get my house converted into a shelter capable of withstanding extreme weather.
",6
14931,Patrick,125," You can say that again.
",6
14932,SpongeBob,125," Actually, I can't.
",6
14933,Patrick,125," Why?
",6
14934,SpongeBob,125," Because I just stepped on one of these nails.
",6
14935,Squidward,125," Laa da dee, laa da da, laa da doo. Got ya. Now just one quick flick of the wrist, and—

14936,Squidward,125," [screams]

14939,SpongeBob,125," Whoo! Nice work, buddy. Now my house can withstand anything nature has to throw at us.
",6

",6
14941,SpongeBob,125," Squidward! Did you come to weather out the storm with us?
",6
14942,Squidward,125," No! I— what storm?
",6
14943,SpongeBob,125," The one Phil Preflemuster told us about.
",6
14944,Squidward,125," Who's that?
",6
14945,Patrick,125," He's the weatherman on the news channel. He said—
",6
14946,Squidward,125," I can't understand a word you're saying.
",6
14947,SpongeBob,125," C'mon Squidward, it'll be fun! While the elements rage outside, we'll snuggle in here and pass the time by playing board games, and playing tic-tac-toe, and drinkin' hot cocoa, and playing tic-tac-toe, and doing jigsaw puzzles, and watchin' TV, and drinkin' hot cocoa, and doing jigsaw puzzles, and playin' board games, and drinkin' hot tea...
",6
14948,Patrick,125," I thought it was cocoa!
",6
14949,SpongeBob,125," Oh, yeah. Hot cocoa... we'll be drinking.
",6
14950,Patrick,125," That's better.
",6
14951,Squidward,125," Well, I think I'll pass.
",6
14952,SpongeBob,125," Even if I let you borrow my huggly snuggly bunny slippers?
",6
14953,Squidward,125," Hmm, I'll have to think about that.
",6
14954,SpongeBob,125," Okay, but you better think fast. Because Patrick really likes my—
",6
14955,SpongeBob,125," Squidward, welcome back! Here's your slippers.
",6
14956,SpongeBob,125," That's better.
",6
14957,Squidward,125," What's better about it? I liked it better before, when I could see!
",6
14958,SpongeBob,125," Squidward, the lights went out.
",6
14959,Squidward,125," Yes, they did, when you turned them off!
",6
14960,Patrick,125," SpongeBob!
",6
14961,SpongeBob,125," Patrick! What is it?
",6
14962,Patrick,125," I never realized how delicious your hot cocoa is.
",6
14963,SpongeBob,125," Thank you, Patrick.
",6
14964,Squidward,125," Oh, boy. How about some of those games you promised?
",6
14965,SpongeBob,125," Okay, boys, let's roll to see who goes first.
",6
14966,Squidward,125," This is tic-tac-toe. You don't roll to see who goes first.
",6
14967,Patrick,125," He's right. You play rock, paper, scissors for it.
",6
14968,SpongeBob,125," Oh, yeah.

14969,Patrick,125," One.

14970,SpongeBob,125," Two.

14977,SpongeBob,125," Tie.

14978,Patrick,125," Darn it!

14979,Squidward,125," One, two, three.

14980,SpongeBob,125," Tie.

14981,Patrick,125," Darn it!
",6
14982,Squidward,125," There, I win. See?
",6
14983,Patrick,125," I'm not seeing anything there.
",6
14984,SpongeBob,125," Yeah, it looks like a lot of junk.
",6
14985,Squidward,125," What do you mean, you're not seeing anything?! There's three in a row right here. Tic-tac-toe!
",6
14986,Patrick,125," Easy, friend.
",6
14987,SpongeBob,125," Yeah, relax, Squidward. We're just here to have fun.
",6
14988,SpongeBob,125," Oh, okay, yeah, okay. Here we go. Congratulations, Squidward.
",6
14989,Patrick,125," Well played.
",6
14990,SpongeBob,125," Come on, Patrick. You can do it.
",6
14991,SpongeBob,125," Be the puzzle piece.
",6
14992,Patrick,125," Cannot complete jigsaw puzzle! Difficulty level too advanced. Rate of brain activity increasing. Ageing process by 30 years per second. [as Patrick turns into an old man, and then a fart noise]
",6
14993,SpongeBob,125," Come on, Grandpa, you can do it. You still got a good few years left in you.
",6
14994,Patrick,125," Eh? [holds up ear trumpet]
",6
14995,SpongeBob,125," Go, Patrick, go! Go, Patrick, Go! Go, Patrick, go! Go, Patrick, go!
",6
14996,Squidward,125," Grrr!
",6
14997,SpongeBob,125," Go, Patrick, go!
",6
14998,Squidward,125," I told you creatures I was trying to take a nap over here. Now for the last time can't you just—
",6
14999,SpongeBob,125," Hang on, Squidward. Patrick was just about to figure out where this last piece of the puzzle goes. Weren't you, Patrick?!
",6
15000,Patrick,125," Who's the green guy?
",6
15001,Squidward,125," It's the last piece of the puzzle! There's only one place it can go. Right here!
",6
15002,SpongeBob,125," Squidward. It wasn't your turn. That's cheating.
",6
15003,Squidward,125," Cheating?! It's a jigsaw puzzle! You can't cheat!
",6
15004,SpongeBob,125," Oh, it's okay, Squidward. We'll just start over.
",6
15005,Squidward,125," I've got to get out of here!
",6
15006,SpongeBob,125," Oh, welcome back, Squidward. We were about to figure out where the first piece of the puzzle goes. Oh, maybe Squidward can help us fig—
",6
15007,Squidward,125," No, I can't.
",6
15008,SpongeBob,125," Please, Squidward?
",6
15009,Squidward,125," No way.
",6
15010,SpongeBob,125," Please...
",6
15011,Squidward,125," I have an even better idea.
",6
15012,SpongeBob,125," What is it?
",6
15013,Patrick,125," Tell us.
",6
15014,SpongeBob and Patrick,125," Tell us! Tell us! Tell us! Tell us!
",6
15015,Squidward,125," Shh. Quiet time. It's a game called ""boundaries.""
",6
15016,Patrick,125," Ooh-ooh-ooh!
",6
15017,Squidward,125," Yes, Patrick?
",6
15018,Patrick,125," Will there be any spelling in this game?
",6
15019,Squidward,125," Oh, no, no spelling.
",6
15020,Patrick,125," Yes!
",6
15021,Squidward,125," It's very simple. The object of the game is to see how long everyone leaves Squidward alone until the storm passes. He will stay inside boundaries, he'll define by chalk lines on the floor.
",6
15022,SpongeBob,125," I have a question.
",6
15023,Squidward,125," What?
",6
15024,SpongeBob,125," Where are you going to get the chalk?
",6
15025,Squidward,125," I brought some!
",6
15026,Squidward,125," Brilliant work, as usual, Squidward. Now all I have to do is sit here until this storm blows over. [his stomach starts growling] Wait a minute. I'm starving. SpongeBob's got to have some snacks around here somewhere. Ah, Jackpot. [he starts eating snail food. Gary meows] I bet you wish you had some of this, don't—? Snail food? [he spits the food out] I've got to get some real food. [SpongeBob is now dressed as a security guard]
",6
15027,SpongeBob,125," Halt! Nobody's to cross this boundary.
",6
15028,Squidward,125," I'm the one who drew the line. You're not supposed to cross.
",6
15029,SpongeBob,125," If you're the one who drew it, let me see some identification papers.
",6
15030,Squidward,125," Identific—? Fine. But when this storm blows over, you'll regret this, mister. What the— what? I don't have them. they must be in my other pants. Look, if you just let me cross, I can go get them. Please, I promise I'll—
",6
15031,SpongeBob,125," Hmm. You may be telling the truth.
",6
15032,Squidward,125," Oh, thank you. I'm just so hungry.
",6
15033,SpongeBob,125," But then again, you may not. Come with me. We shall find out the truth.
",6
15034,Squidward,125," That'll be the day.
",6
15035,SpongeBob,125," Stop that cephalopod!
",6
15036,Squidward,125," Please. I just want to get back onto my side of boundary.
",6
15037,SpongeBob,125," This, I cannot allow. It's against the rules.
",6
15038,Squidward,125," But all I wanted was something to eat.
",6
15039,Patrick,125," Did somebody say something to eat?
",6
15040,SpongeBob,125," Patrick, look out!
",6
15041,Squidward,125," Whoa! [screams]
",6
15042,Squidward,125," My food!
",6
15043,SpongeBob,125," Your food?
",6
15044,Patrick,125," Hey, I want some too.
",6
15045,Squidward,125," Is this what we've really come to? Is one little storm all it takes to turn us all into complete animals?
",6
15046,SpongeBob,125," Apparently so. Well, that and a refrigerator full of food anyways.
",6
15047,Squidward,125," Did you hear that?
",6
15048,SpongeBob,125," It's just Patrick gnawing on his can.
",6
15049,Squidward,125," No, no, no, no, no, no, not that. I mean from outside.
",6
15050,SpongeBob,125," I don't hear anything.
",6
15051,Squidward,125," The storm must've stopped.
",6
15052,SpongeBob,125," Squidward, wait!
",6
15053,Squidward,125," Woooo-hoooo! So long, suckers! [screams]
",6
15054,Squidward,125," Oof! Oh, curse you, Preflumster!",6

",6
15062,Neptune,126," Wait! Rochelle was just about to meet her biological parents!
",6
15063,Amphitrite,126," Is this about turning 5,000 today?
",6
15064,Neptune,126," No. Oh, my darling Amphitrite, it is not my age that troubles me so. It's that our son, Triton, will not be able to share in my revelry.
",6
15065,Amphitrite,126," Let's forget about Triton for just one day. It's your 5,000th birthday, for shell's sake.

15071,SpongeBob,126," I'm not using my hands because today is ""Work Without Your Hands Day"". [jumps out of costume] You should give it a whirl, buddy. [enters the kitchen and hears phone ring.

",6
15072,SpongeBob,126," So much for ""Work Without Your Hands Day,"" SquarePants. You answer to a higher calling this day. I have the capability! [Raises up spatula and light flashes on spatula. Then SpongeBob turns to Patrick who is standing in the corner] OK, that's enough Patrick, thank you.
",6
15073,Mr. Krabs,126," You two really outdid yourselves. It almost makes me want to pay you. [chuckling] Oh, yeah. [passes pole with ribbons and two balloons] Looks like this area could use a few more decorations. Squidward!
",6
15074,Squidward,126," Now, what?
",6
15075,Mr. Krabs,126," The decorations over here look a little sparse. Why don't you hang up a few balloons or something? [walks away]
",6
15076,Mr. Krabs,126," [walks back] Oh, that's better. Looks lovely, Squidward. Excellent work. How goes it over here?
",6
15077,SpongeBob,126," All set, Mr. K. 5,000 patties, one for every year Neptune's been alive.
",6
15078,Mr. Krabs,126," 5,000 patties at $3.99 a pop? [babbles nonsensically due to how much money he'll get]

",6
15081,Mr. Krabs,126," This ain't for you, lad. This is for King Neptune. Today is his birthday.
",6
15082,Shubie,126," Oh, uh, wait, King Neptune is coming here? Oh, I am a huge fan of the royal family. I just love everything they do. Could we please, maybe, watch them eat, right here through the window, you know?
",6
15083,Mr. Krabs,126," Don't be ridiculous. Why in Neptune's name would I let you...[thought bubble of Mr. Krabs bangs him in between the eyes with a money gavel]

15087,Fish #19,126," You got change for a twenty?
",6
15088,Mr. Krabs,126," Nope, sorry. I guess that it's twenty dollars for for you then. Don't be shy folks. Seats are going fast.
",6
15089,Neptune,126," Greetings, my obedient flock.
",6
15090,Neptune,126," [to Amphitrite] You were right, honey. Hearing these mortals cheer for me has made me feel better already.
",6
15091,SpongeBob,126," Excuse me, Mr. Royal Sea Kingness, your table is this way,sir.
",6
15092,Neptune,126," Oh, these seats are surprisingly comfortable for being long-lord and primitive storage vessels.
",6
15093,Amphitrite,126," Oh, husband, I'm so glad to see that you're enjoying your birthday party.
",6
15094,Neptune,126," And I am glad that you are glad, dear.
",6
15095,Amphitrite,126," And I'm glad that you're glad that I'm glad, my king.
",6
15096,Neptune,126," And I'm glad that you're glad that I'm glad that you're glad...
",6
15097,Monsters,126," Alright already!
",6
15098,Neptune,126," And methinks I shall continue to enjoy us all as long as there's no mention of the name...
",6
15099,SpongeBob,126," Triton, Triton, Triton? Is there a Triton here? Is there anybody missing from this party that any of you guys can see?
",6
15100,Amphitrite,126," Nope, there's nobody missing, we're all here.
",6
15101,SpongeBob,126," Oh, I was sure there's somebody..[sees an empty seat] Oh! Here it is right here. An empty seat.
",6
15102,Neptune,126," That's not an empty seat. My wife is sitting there.
",6
15103,SpongeBob,126," [laughs] No, not that chair, your Highness. That one, see? It even has its pretty name card that I made still on it.
",6
15104,Neptune,126," Oh no.
",6
15105,SpongeBob,126," T-R-I-T-O-N. You sure you don't know anyone named Triton? [Neptune sobs] Should I put it down yes or no?
",6
15106,Amphitrite,126," Triton is our son. But as you can see, the king doesn't want to talk about it right now.
",6
15107,Neptune,126," Thank you, my darling. I'd rather not share with this addled mortal the woeful story of our son, Triton. [all agree] But I suppose I could tell it. [all disagree] No, you're right, I won't tell it. [all breathe a sigh of relief,pulls out a projector] Instead, I'm going to show this movie I made about it. [all groan] Could someone please dim the lights? [lights are dimmed]
",6
15108,Neptune,126," [narrating] It all started one day while giving Triton his smiting lessons.
",6
15109,Neptune,126," That's how you strike fear into the hearts of your subjects! Now you try, son. Son?
",6
15110,Neptune,126," [narrating] Triton was increasingly fascinated with the miserable world of the lowly mortals.
",6
15111,Triton,126," Dad, when are you going to teach me the ball and stick game?
",6
15112,Neptune,126," Never. Now take hold of your trident and practice your smiting, son.
",6
15113,Triton,126," I don't feel like smiting. I wanna play the ball and stick game.
",6
15114,Neptune,126," OK, son, you want to learn the stick and ball game? Well here's your first lesson. Batter up. [The trident zaps one of the stadium's lights. Everyone in the baseball field starts screaming] It looks like I just hit a single. Let's see if you can get a home run, son.
",6
15115,Triton,126," Leave me alone, Dad. [swims back home]
",6
15116,Neptune,126," [narrating] What was happening to my own flesh and blood? Over the next few millennia, my son grew not only in size, but in perplexing behavior.
",6
15117,Neptune,126," What is going on in here?
",6
15118,Triton,126," Hey, Dad, check it out! I'm studying chemistry, and I've just created a cure for all mortal diseases!
",6
15119,Neptune,126," [pushes all the beakers out of the table angrily, then grabs Triton by his arms] How many times do I have to tell you? We are gods! We don't have diseases, nor do we care whether or not the mortals contract them!
",6
15120,Triton,126," Gosh! [moves away]
",6
15121,Neptune,126," [to the camera] Try as I might, it was becoming increasingly apparent that we would not agree on the ways of the world. I knew I had no choice. There was only one last resort. [shows video of girls dancing on a beach] No, not that one! The Island in the Sky.
",6
15122,Triton,126," Isn't that island a miniature golf course?
",6
15123,Neptune,126," No! The one on the other side of the river
",6
15124,Triton,126," You mean the juvenile correction facility? But that place is for losers, man.
",6
15125,Neptune,126," Uh-huh.
",6
15126,Triton,126," Okay, I'm standing in here. Now what? [Neptune locks Triton up in a cage] What are you doing? This is bogus!
",6
15127,Neptune,126," I'm sealing you inside this magical shrinking cage until you learn to embrace your destiny as one of the gods!
",6
15128,Triton,126," Noooooo!
",6
15129,Triton,126," You call that shrinking?
",6
15130,Neptune,126," Well, it only shrinks 7%.
",6
15131,Triton,126," Man, that is just beyond bogus.
",6
15132,Neptune,126," Perhaps in your eyes, it is beyond bogus, but it is the only way you'll learn. [Pulls rope to hang the cage up a tree] Reflect on this for 10,000 years.
",6
15133,Triton,126," You can't do this, man! I've got a life to live. I can't be stuck in this cage, man! [Neptune leaves the island] God. I hate you, old man, you hear me? I hate you! [echoes]
",6
15134,Neptune,126," And that's that.
",6
15135,Mr. Krabs,126," Huh? Okay, who's ready for a piping hot Krabby Patty? Would you like the first one, your highness?
",6
15136,Neptune,126," Recounting this sad tale has upset me so much, I've lost my appetite. [sobs]
",6
15137,Amphitrite,126," Take those sandwiches away! Can't you see the king is upset? [turns to Neptune] It's okay, let it out.
",6
15138,Male fish,126," This is a rip-off! I paid to watch high-class royal dining action, not listen to a boring sob story.
",6
15139,Monica,126," Ooh, looks like things may be picking up! Royal violence!
",6
15140,Amphitrite,126," Why have you not obeyed me, mortal? Be gone!
",6
15141,Mr. Krabs,126," So who's going to pay for these, then?
",6
15142,Mr. Krabs,126," Oh! If Neptune doesn't cheer up soon, me business is ruined.
",6
15143,SpongeBob,126," Oh no. This is all my fault because I mentioned [whispers] Triton.
",6
15144,Squidward,126," Well, it wouldn't be the first time you've ruined everything, but the worst part is those 5,000 Krabby Patties that will end up going rotten in the hot sun.
",6
15145,SpongeBob,126," Stop, Squidward, please stop! Your descriptions are too horrifying for my delicate sensibilities.
",6
15146,Squidward,126," I do have a way with words.
",6
15147,Neptune,126," Oh, how I miss my son! [sobbing]
",6
15148,SpongeBob,126," Hey, that's it! I'll fix all this by reuniting Neptune with his son!
",6
15149,SpongeBob,126," [waving] Thanks again, Mr. Bus Driver!
",6
15150,SpongeBob,126," [turning to island] Now, all I've got to do is find King Neptune's long-lost son.
",6
15151,Mr. Krabs,126," Come on, Krabs! Think, think! [suddenly gets idea] Ooh! [turns to Squidward]
",6
15152,Squidward,126," Whatever it is, no.
",6
15153,Mr. Krabs,126," Squidward, you're a man of culture.
",6
15154,Squidward,126," Go on.
",6
15155,Mr. Krabs,126," Well, these highfalutin' types, they might appreciate that, don't you think? Why don't you try and razzle-dazzle them with all your pizazz?
",6
15156,Squidward,126," Pizazz. Hold on to your hats and glasses, people, because Squidward the Fantabulous has arrived.
",6
15157,Squidward,126," Thank you. Thank you. This next one, I wrote myself. I like to call it, 'Three Barnacles are a Crowd Unless They've Known Each Other for a Really Long Time.' [clarinet music plays]
",6
15158,Frank,126," Things just got lame again.
",6
15159,Monica,126," Yeah, well, they better get un-lame real quick, or I'm asking for my money back.
",6
15160,Frank,126," No refunds!? Well, I guess we're stuck here, then.
",6
15161,SpongeBob,126," What the—I had the strangest dream that I just got hit in the head with a tiny toenail clipping.
",6
15162,SpongeBob,126," [looks down and picks up fingernail] Hey, I was right! It is a tiny toenail clipping.
",6
15163,SpongeBob,126," [gasps] Another one! [sees rope] Plus some rope. [lowers cage with Triton inside]
",6
15164,Triton,126," Hey, man, what's the big idea?
",6
15165,SpongeBob,126," [doesn't know Triton was talking, nor does he see him] Who said that? Show yourself! I'm warning you. I know how to use these! [makes karate noises and karate moves]
",6
15166,Triton,126," [turns to SpongeBob] I'm down here, man!
",6
15167,SpongeBob,126," Oh, hello, little fella. Maybe you can help me. Because if I don't find Triton soon, Krabs is gonna be real upset, because he spent a lot of money on party decorations.
",6
15168,Triton,126," Party decorations? For what?
",6
15169,SpongeBob,126," For King Neptune's birthday!
",6
15170,Triton,126," So, it's my old man's birthday. Big deal.
",6
15171,SpongeBob,126," [gasps] You mean, you're King Neptune's son?
",6
15172,Triton,126," I am, but he doesn't seem to think so.
",6
15173,SpongeBob,126," Well, he sure seemed upset that you weren't at his birthday party.
",6
15174,Triton,126," Hah! That's a real good one, man. Real funny.
",6
15175,SpongeBob,126," [laughs a little] Well, thanks, but...
",6
15176,Triton,126," Do you think if that old goat really cared, he'd have me sealed up in this magical cage with nothing to do all day [holds up a pair of nail clippers] but trim my fingernails, man?
",6
15177,SpongeBob,126," You're right. It just doesn't make any sense.
",6
15178,Triton,126," You're telling me, man.
",6
15179,SpongeBob,126," I mean, gods shouldn't have to use nail clippers. They should be able to wear their fingernails to whatever length they want!
",6
15180,Triton,126," Man, you're just like all the rest. [turns away]
",6
15181,SpongeBob,126," Don't go.
",6
15182,SpongeBob,126," What if there was a way to free you from this magical cage? Then, you could come to your father's birthday party and settle your differences!
",6
15183,Triton,126," May I ask you to brush your teeth first, dude. P.U!
",6
15184,SpongeBob,126," Sorry, I haven't had anything to drink in a couple of days, my throats a little dry.
",6
15185,Triton,126," [coughs] This cage is only so big man
",6
15186,SpongeBob,126," I'm sorry, I'll stop talking, I swear
",6
15187,Triton,126," Never mind, just undo the lock
",6
15188,SpongeBob,126," [looks at lock] boy this really does look complicated, oh I see, I'll just slide this square to the right, this one goes up, one other here and ohh wait, no, ahh, no squares [start circling his face and he screams] man that really is a tough nut to crack
",6
15189,Triton,126," That lock was forged by the gods, not any numbskull can open like a cheap bag of potato chips they found in the street.
",6
15190,SpongeBob,126," Cheap bag of potato choo wait a minute, which way to the nearest phone booth?
",6
15191,Triton,126," Theres one behind that rock over there, but I don't see why...
",6
15192,SpongeBob,126," [runs to phone booth and rings Patrick] Patrick?
",6
15193,Patrick,126," Hey, you'll never guess what I found on the street [SpongeBob talks on phone] yeah, I'll hurry [declines]
",6
15194,SpongeBob,126," Oh Patrick, you made it, this is the magical lock I was talking about, [holds up lock]
",6
15195,Patrick,126," Hmmm
",6
15196,SpongeBob,126," Yeah, I tried for hours and hours but I just can't get it to...
",6
15197,Patrick,126," [undoes the lock] Open!
",6
15198,SpongeBob,126," Wow, all ready, Patrick you know I'll never figure out how you do those so darn fast.
",6
15199,Patrick,126," I just peel the stickers of the squares and put them back on in the right spaces
",6
15200,SpongeBob,126," Amazing!
",6
15201,Triton,126," Say, now this silly old cage is open, why don't we pay my old man a visit. Hate to keep him waiting on his birthday. [Triton flies up and turns the cage into a sports car and hops in] you guys coming or what?
",6
15202,SpongeBob,126," Wow!
",6
15203,Patrick,126," Are you going to take us for a ride?
",6
15204,Triton,126," A ride, thats a great idea
",6
15205,Triton,126," You guys don't mind if pull over for a second?
",6
15206,SpongeBob,126," Sure Triton, what do you need to use, the bathroom.
",6
15207,Triton,126," No, to tell you I don't need you any more. [kicks SpongeBob and Patrick out and drives off]
",6
15208,Patrick,126," What an interesting man
",6
15209,Mr. Krabs,126," Ready for a room temperature Krabby Patty yet?
",6
15210,Neptune,126," Nope
",6
15211,Squidward,126," Careful, this is made out of imported wood, imported all they way from the junk pile out the back.
",6
15212,Mr. Krabs,126," Neptune is inconsolable, if only there where something to distract him from his pain.
",6
15213,Squidward,126," The only thing that can usually do that is something that causes more pain.
",6
15214,Mr. Krabs,126," Great idea, go and play them another song.
",6
15215,Neptune,126," [to Amphitrite] He's back
",6
15216,Amphitrite,126," Oh, how...nice?
",6
15217,Squidward,126," If pleases the king, I would like to preform a...
",6
15218,Squidward,126," What the?[looks at clarinet]
",6
15219,Neptune,126," Behold!
",6
15220,Mr. Krabs,126," [whispers to Squidward] What he say?
",6
15221,Squidward,126," I think he wants us to look at the O MY!
",6
15222,Frank,126," That was incredible!
",6
15223,Monica,126," Yeah, definitely worth the five bucks.
",6
15224,Neptune,126," Son?!
",6
15225,Neptune,126," Son, I demand to know the meaning of this impudent imprisonment.
",6
15226,Triton,126," Well it turns out you where right old man, being trapped in that cage all those years with nowhere to go but up here made me realize something, dabbling in the world of mere mortals is totally lame.
",6
15227,Neptune,126," And this is how you intend on showing it.
",6
15228,Triton,126," No man, this is how! [flies through the roof] Hahaha
",6
15229,Neptune,126," By flying through the roof?
",6
15230,Monica,126," That was Triton, Neptune's son!
",6
15231,Frank,126," I thought he was in reform school or something.
",6
15232,Purple Fish,126," Can I have an autograph?
",6
15233,Triton,126," Sure you can.
",6
15234,Triton,126," Nothing can stop me! Hahaha
",6
15235,SpongeBob,126," What's happened here?Hello, where is everybody?
",6
15236,Patrick,126," Do you think Triton was in that cage for a reason.
",6
15237,SpongeBob,126," [gasps] the Krusty Krab!
",6
15238,Patrick,126," It's still standing.
",6
15239,SpongeBob,126," But look, that mail hasn't been picked up today.[shows letters in front of the Krusty Krab]
",6
15240,Patrick,126," Right
",6
15241,SpongeBob,126," We better use the secret entrance.
",6
15242,SpongeBob,126," Be very very quiet.
",6
15243,Patrick,126," Gotcha pall [throws stove top causing a chain reaction of loud noises] What?
",6
15244,Mr. Krabs,126," Please! I'll be ruined!
",6
15245,Neptune,126," Don't worry Mr. Krabs, no one was going to pay for them anyway [this causes Mr. Krabs to cry]
",6
15246,SpongeBob,126," Oh, this is terrible
",6
15247,Patrick,126," Tell me about it, I never get free food here.
",6
15248,Neptune,126," Son, hear my words, I can understand if you want to keep me locked up in this cage and set me, but see it in your heart to release these others as they are innocent. Well, maybe not all of them [looks at the small purple guy]
",6
15249,Triton,126," Sorry old man, you lost me up in the hear in my words part.
",6
15250,Patrick,126," He's unstoppable.
",6
15251,SpongeBob,126," Only as long as King Neptune is locked up.
",6
15252,Patrick,126," You thinking what I'm thinking?
",6
15253,SpongeBob,126," Yeah, Triple Gooberry Sundays tonight after we free them.
",6
15254,Patrick,126," Ah no, but I like your idea better!
",6
15255,SpongeBob,126," Make ready the disguise.
",6
15256,Triton,126," [doesn't notice the stove] Hehe.
",6
15257,SpongeBob,126," Okay, now! [SpongeBob shuffle the stove next to the stage without Triton noticing them]
",6
15258,Neptune,126," Please, no more!
",6
15259,SpongeBob,126," Quick Patrick, unlock it before he sees us
",6
15260,Patrick,126," You got it[Patrick reaches for the lock] SpongeBob, scootch back a little. [to the purple guy] Excuse me 
",6
15261,SpongeBob,126," Hurry up Patrick, he's getting bored
",6
15262,Patrick,126," Don't rush me! Okay got it!
",6
15263,Triton,126," Hehe, I was just kidding man[flies off. Looks back and thinks he's escaped until Neptune flies in front of him] No No, please, I-I-I never meant to...
",6
15264,Neptune,126," Son I have tried all my life to be gentle, but this time you have..[looks behind him and notices the destroyed Bikini Bottom] Are you responsible for all this destruction!?
",6
15265,Triton,126," Don't send me back to the cage man, I-I-I...
",6
15266,Neptune,126," The Cage! Why son you have just given me the best 5000th birthday present I ever received! You finally learnt to use your god powers. Now I know when my reign comes to a close, I'll have a worthy successor and that's all I could really hope for as a king [sobs] and as your father come here. [they hug]
",6
15267,Triton,126," Aww dad, I love you man. [light shines on them]
",6
15268,Neptune,126," Now lets go home son. [they enter the carriage]
",6
15269,Amphitrite,126," Too do loo.
",6
15270,Mr. Krabs,126," Neptune and friends wait! What about the party? What about me restaurant?
",6
15271,Neptune,126," [from the carriage] Ow, yes. Many thanks whoever you are. It was the best day I could of ever hoped for and it's all because of your little boy there. None of this would've happened if it wasn't for his actions! [carriage disappears]
",6
15272,SpongeBob,126," Did you hear that, Neptune this was all because of me.
",6
15273,Patrick,126," Well SpongeBob that's...
",6
15274,Sadie,126," Did you hear that, Neptune said it was all because of that guy!
",6
15275,Policeman,126," He did,did he!
",6
15276,Patrick,126," Ahh, SpongeBob.
",6
15277,SpongeBob,126," Yes Patrick?
",6
15278,Patrick,126," Do you think now's a good time to get those Triple Gooberry Sundays you where talking about?

15288,Squidward,127," No, no, no. Take your time. It's worth the wait.

15289,Squidward,127," How sophisticating! [drinks coffee]
",7
15290,Announcer,127," ...has been cancelled! [buzzer sounds]
",7
15291,Squidward,127," [spits out steam] Oh, yeah, I haven't made the coffee yet. [cuts to coffee maker as he makes the coffee] Why in the world would they cancel ""Fab and Fancy?"" What could possibly be more enriching? [as he drinks his coffee, guitar music starts playing, the house starts shaking and Squidward spits out coffee] What?! [a man continues to play the guitar on TV. He's then lit on fire, and then explodes and a title card comes up saying ""The Guitar Lord"".]
",7
15292,Zeus,127," Hey. I'm Zeus the Guitar Lord. I don't have a guitar yet. But if I did, I would want a really killer one like this! [pulls out a paper, showing a red guitar]

15293,Squidward,127," [He scoffs. In an angered tone] He obviously doesn't know the first thing about music! This is an outrage!

15294,Squidward,127," [angrily] Where is my ""Fab and Fancy?!""

15295,Zeus,127," Your... what?
",7
15296,Squidward,127," I'm quite certain you wouldn't know culture if it bit you on the guitar!
",7
15297,Zeus,127," Uh... hummm... I don't have a guitar.
",7
15298,Squidward,127," Do they just give a show to just anybody over there?
",7
15299,Zeus,127," Pretty much. My mom gave me this one for my birthday.
",7
15300,Squidward,127," [surprised] Really?
",7
15301,Zeus,127," Yeah. I wanted a guitar or a star named after me... but you know, whatever. I guess a TV show is cool.
",7
15302,Squidward,127," It's that easy? [hangs up phone and dials a number] Hello? Bikini Bottom Public Access? [excitedly] Give me a TV show! Give me a TV show! I want a show!

",7
15303,SpongeBob,127," Ohhh, yeah! Oh, limelight basking! Baskin' in the limelight! [laughs] Oh, good times. Good times. [turns to Squidward] So where will said basking take place?
",7
15304,SpongeBob,127," Say again, Squidward? [Squidward laughs as he runs home]
",7
15305,Squidward,127," [in his home] Greetings. I'm Squidward Tentacles, your host of ""Squidward Chat"". [Gary is seen watching TV at his house. He pushes a button on the remote.] [Off-Screen] Today, on Squidward Chat, we'll be discussing something near and dear to my heart, under-appreciated artists like myself.

15306,SpongeBob,127," Squidward's on TV? [screams and rushes to Squidward's house] Squidward! Squidward! [he pants and then rushes into the house, but goes back out, knocks and then goes inside. He pants as he approaches Squidward] Squidward, you're on TV! [Squidward frowns] No, really, Squidward, come look!
",7
15307,Squidward,127," I know I'm on TV! See the camera? [They both look at a camera] You're on TV too! [SpongeBob stares at the camera]
",7
15308,SpongeBob,127," TV? [leaves happily]
",7
15309,Squidward,127," Moron. As I was saying, today, on Squidward Chat, we'll be discussing...
",7
15310,Patrick,127," Wow! [SpongeBob enters with Patrick]
",7
15311,SpongeBob,127," So I ran to tell Squidward that he was on TV and he told me that I was on TV and now you're on TV!
",7
15312,Patrick,127," I'm on TV?! [rushes back to his house and turns on the TV]
",7
15313,Squidward,127," This isn't happening!
",7
15314,Patrick,127," I'm not on TV! [rushes back into Squidward's house] SpongeBob! I went home and turned on my TV, but... I wasn't on the TV. Why did you lie to me, SpongeBob? Why?
",7
15315,Squidward,127," [annoyingly] Patrick, just how dumb are you?
",7
15316,Patrick,127," It varies.
",7
15317,Squidward,127," If you want to be on TV, you have to be in front of the camera!
",7
15318,Patrick,127," Ohhh. I get it! [rushes to camera, giggling] Hi, TV people! [puts his face on the lens, then shows his mouth] And my mouth is on TV! [a live action shot of the inside of a person's mouth is shown on a television set]
",7
15319,Grandma,127," This is disgusting!
",7
15320,Patrick,127," [licks and bites the lens] SpongeBob! You gotta try this! [they both play with the camera]
",7
15321,Squidward,127," Patrick, SpongeBob, get off my camera! [gets Patrick off the camera, but Patrick falls onto Squidward. Squidward growls and pushes Patrick off of him] Would you get out of here?
",7
15322,Patrick,127," [scratching his head] Doubt it. [Squidward slaps his head and sighs]
",7
15323,Squidward,127," If you like the camera so much, why don't you be the cameraman?
",7
15324,Patrick,127," Cameraman?
",7
15325,Squidward,127," That means you take all the pretty pictures. [makes air quotes]
",7
15326,Patrick,127," All right!
",7
15327,SpongeBob,127," Ooh ooh! Whoo! Whoo! Let me do something too, please?!
",7
15328,Squidward,127," Fine. You can be the soundman. [hands SpongeBob a boom microphone]
",7
15329,SpongeBob,127," [amazed as an angelic choir sings] Soundman...
",7
15330,Squidward,127," Imbeciles! [clears throat] Today, we're going to be talking about... [camera is aimed at a still painting of Squidward] Why isn't the camera on me? [Patrick moves it to another painting] No! I'm the one talking! [Patrick moves the camera around, Squidward growls and jumps in front of the camera] I'm right here! Ahem! Today on Squidward Chat... we'll be discussing the under-appreciated arts. [Squidward sits down] Patrick, I'm down here! [Patrick lowers camera] As I was saying, today, we'll be... [Patrick moves the camera up and down once] Today... [Patrick moves the camera up and down repeatedly and Squidward growls]
",7

15342,Plankton,127," Oh, please. I can cause far more collateral damage than that! [walks off] Karen, where'd you put my death ray?

",7
15351,Larry the Lobster,127," [as Squidward frowns] Did somebody say housewarming? Hey, everyone! It's a housewarming! [citizens come into Squidward's house cheering as the house's cheeks start puffing up. Squidward notices everyone talking as a limousine pulls up and a man comes out]
",7
15352,Squidward,127," Get off my set! This is not working! [the man comes in]
",7
15353,Man,127," Actually, I'd say the show is doing just fine. [he approaches Squidward] At least according to our latest ratings. [pulls out a bag of money, big at first, but then zooms out to show that the bag is tiny. He then laughs, coughs and clears his throat] This is actually a lot by public access standards. Everyone is working out except for you... [points to a lady] ...you... [points to a boy] ...you... [points to a man] ...and you! [points to Squidward]

15354,Squidward,127," Me? [Squidward is kicked out of his house. Cuts to Squidward in the bed frowning with a remote in his hand]

[Squidward growls] Let's party! [As a curtain reveals Zeus, he begins to play guitar as audience cheers and applauds. The scene zooms out to show Sandy line-dancing, SpongeBob playing the keyboard, Patrick playing the drums and Pearl doing her cheer. Mr. Krabs swings on a rope holding the sign that says ""Eat at the Krusty Krab"" as Plankton is pressing buttons, which fire lasers. Cuts to TV, then to Squidward, who is shocked]
",7
15356,Squidward,127," [as he stomps on the floor while holding a broom] Keep it down! I'm trying to sleep! [screams as the camera pans down on Zeus, rocks start falling from the ceiling. People continue to party around Squidward's house. Fades to black, ending the episode.]",7

15419,Krabs,128," [chuckles nervously] G-g-good idea, SpongeBob. That sounds just perfect.
",7
15420,Squidward,128," Not so fast! That crab is a food thief! He snuck into my house in the middle of the night, stole every last morsel in my kitchen, and he even swiped my entire collection of smoked kielbasas.

15421,SpongeBob,128," But I thought he was having a slumber party at my house.
",7
15422,Squidward,128," I don't care. I'm calling the police. [dialing]

15424,Squidward,128," Oh? And why is that?

15426,Squidward,128," Hello, police?
",7
15427,Krabs,128," Hold it! I'll... I'll...

15428,Squidward,128," You'll what? You'll give me your golden tooth?
",7
15429,SpongeBob,128," I didn't know Mr. Krabs had a gold tooth.
",7
15430,Squidward,128," Neither did I.
",7
15431,Krabs,128," [sobbing] Oh, SpongeBob, what am I gonna do?
",7
15432,SpongeBob,128," Oh, don't worry Mr. Krabs. I had a tooth pulled a few years ago. Only hurts for a couple of days.
",7
15433,Krabs,128," It's not that, boy. Those nerves died years ago. It's me dear daughter, Pearl.
",7
15434,SpongeBob,128," Pearl? What happened?
",7
15435,Krabs,128," She's going through one of them growth spurts, and I can't find a way to feed her.
",7
15436,SpongeBob,128," Mr. Krabs, you're the owner of the most delightfully delicious restaurant in Bikini Bottom! Why don't you just take her there to eat?
",7
15437,Krabs,128," Hold on, boy. I said I was trying to feed me daughter, not completely obliterate me inventory.
",7
15438,SpongeBob,128," You don't have to do that. I know a special ingredient that can make one Krabby Patty taste like a million.
",7
15439,Pearl,128," Oh, Oh! So hungry, not gonna make it!
",7
15440,Krabs,128," SpongeBob, hurry it up!
",7
15441,SpongeBob,128," Hang in there, Mr. Krabs. Almost ready.
",7
15442,Krabs,128," You've been saying that for the last-- [SpongeBob appears with the Krabby Patty.. The Krabby Patty is put in Pearl's mouth. She burps]
",7
15443,Pearl,128," Daddy, I'm not hungry anymore, and I've stopped growing. I feel great. Heh, Heh!
",7
15444,Krabs,128," Whew! Boy, I'm glad that's over. And it only cost me one Krabby Patty. Say, what was that secret ingredient you used in there, anyways, boy?
",7
15445,SpongeBob,128," It was love, Mr. Krabs. It was love.

15512,Plankton,129," [taking notes] 283 seconds. I can't believe I'm getting all this straight from the source. How could this get any easier?
",7
15513,Mr. Krabs,129," I'm puttin' the secret Krabby Patty formula out in plain sight.
",7
15514,Plankton,129," Yee-haw!
",7
15515,Mr. Krabs,129," Yeah... Anyway, I'm gonna leave it out here while I clean out the safe. Don't let it out of your sight, boy-o.
",7
15516,SpongeBob,129," [saluting Mr. Krabs] You can always count on me, Mr. K.
",7
15517,Plankton,129," Oh-ho ho, man! That secret formula is as good as mine.
",7
15518,Sandy,129," That no-good who nabbed my pelt surely came here. Probably wanted to cash it in on the Bikini Bottom black market. Well, not if I catch that varmint first.
",7
15519,Sandy,129," You! You seen anybody in these parts haulin' a fur pelt?
",7
15520,Harold,129," Look! A naked chipmunk!
",7
15521,Sandy,129," Chipmunk?! What is so funny about havin' my fur stole?
",7
15522,Random Fish,129," Aren't you ashamed of having your pink rat flesh exposed?
",7
15523,Everyone,129," Yeah!
",7
15524,Sandy,129," [to herself] With this much attention, that no-good fur thief will see me comin' a mile away. I best find somethin' to cover my hind end.
",7
15525,Sandy,129," Time to go catch me some skunk!
",7
15526,SpongeBob,129," Now that we're grillin', we can work on the fixin's! See, there are two patties here. But before we get into slicing and dicing we always start with the washing. We'll begin with the seaweed.
",7
15527,Plankton,129," Okay, I'll stand on thata' side for a better view.
",7
15528,SpongeBob,129," Okey dokey, but pay close attention, for cleanliness is the public's last defense against a life of horrible disease.
",7
15529,Plankton,129," There it is.
",7
15530,SpongeBob,129," Always ensure that your brush is adequately lathered....Always making sure to get both sides...
",7
15531,Plankton,129," That's nice. That's interestin'.
",7
15532,Plankton,129," Almost there...
",7
15533,SpongeBob,129," Then lay it down onto the drying rack and we'll engage our drying phase, hmm.
",7
15534,SpongeBob,129," Sandy!
",7
15535,Plankton,129," [Panicky] What, nothin'!
",7
15536,SpongeBob,129," Remember, never overdry. Otherwise, the seaweed becomes brittle and cracks.
",7
15537,Sandy,129," That dastardly rustler's got to be somewhere in these parts.
",7
15538,Police,129," Hey, look! A hairless goat! [Sandy looks at the police, embarrassed and sheepish]
",7
15539,SpongeBob,129," Steady, steady... Nice. Oh, you're off-center by 3.6 millimeters. Mmmph, try it again, Sandy.
",7
15540,Plankton,129," [to himself] Aaugh! This is getting so tedious!
",7
15541,Plankton/Sandy Robot,129," Maybe you should demonstrate a few more times so I can get the hang of it.
",7
15542,SpongeBob,129," Or, we could address your problem areas directly. Are you struggling with the final wrist flick? Or is your difficulty with the initial transfer move?
",7
15543,Plankton,129," [frustrated] Gah!
",7
15544,Sandy,129," I'm tired of running. Time to take a stand.
",7
15545,Random Fish,129," A nudist ferret!
",7
15546,Fish,129," Get in the car, kids!
",7
15547,Sandy,129," It's not my fault! I...
",7
15548,Sandy,129," I better go underground.
",7
15549,Sandy,129," What am I gonna do? If I'm ever gonna catch this thug, I'm gonna need some help.
",7
15550,SpongeBob,129," Oh, still off by that much. Try it again. [Plankton groans, but tries again] Ooh, try again [Plankton tries again] Mmm, try again. [Plankton tries again] Oh, try again. [Plankton tries again] Oh, try again.
",7
15551,SpongeBob,129," Eh, try again.
",7
15552,Plankton,129,"  [extremely frustrated] Arrrgghh! You try it again! I'm makin' my move!
",7
15553,Plankton,129," It's finally mine! Time to kick this baby into four-paw drive!
",7
15554,SpongeBob,129," Wait, Sandy! We can work this out!
",7
15555,Sandy,129," My pelt!
",7
15556,SpongeBob,129," Mr Krabs! Sandy's makin' off with the formula!
",7
15557,SpongeBob,129," Sandy, you're naked! And you don't have any clothes on!
",7
15558,Sandy,129," Unhand my pelt, you unknown varmint!
",7
15559,Plankton,129," Only from my cold, dead feelers!
",7
15560,Sandy,129," PLANKTON! I should have known this was your doin'! Now feel this!
",7
15561,Sandy,129," Hi-ya!
",7
15562,Sandy,129," Pwaaaaa!
",7
15563,Sandy,129," Gotcha! And now for the appropriate punishment for a no-good, yella' belly like yourself.
",7
15564,Plankton,129," My eye! This condiment is highly irritating to my eye!
",7
15565,Mr. Krabs,129," Oh, thank you Sandy. Thank you Sandy.
",7
15566,Sandy,129," Uh, sure, Mr. Krabs. [The police arrives]
",7
15567,Police,129," We'll take that sicko off your hands.
",7
15568,Sandy,129," Cops! Thank goodness you've come. [Sandy holds up the jar of mustard] Take this sicko away!
",7
15569,Police,129," Actually, we're referring to you, ma'am. Public nudity is against the law in this county. [The policeman handcuff Sandy's wrist] But don't fret. You'll look just fine in prison orange.

15578,Squidward,130," [gives SpongeBob a order] SpongeBob, order… [SpongeBob stretches his hand out, and gets the order] …up.
",7
15579,SpongeBob,130," [is reading order] One double Krabby Patty with everything on it, one order of Kelp Fries, one... [looks confused at order] Squidward, what size of kelp fries are these?
",7

",7
15581,Squidward,130," Medium.
",7
15582,SpongeBob,130," Comin' right up! [SpongeBob rubs the order ticket on Squidward's head then disappears to the kitchen. Cooks the patty with steam rising up as SpongeBob brings the kelp fries. Brings the order but SpongeBob slips in a puddle of grease, the order flies into the customer's face]

",7
15592,Krabs,130," Hmm... Nothing's coming out.
",7
15593,SpongeBob,130," Mr. Krabs. Can I see that? Saw this in a movie once. [sucks the tube in order to get the grease out but nothing come out] mmm... Yeah maybe i wasn't doing it right. [grease spews out onto Mr. Krabs' face] Oh never mind! I was. [fills up the tank] Yeah.. Nothing like a long night siphoning grease to put some hair on your chest, Eh? Mr. Krabs?
",7
15594,Mr. Krabs,130," What?
",7
15595,SpongeBob,130," Well Now we got the ol' grease trap cleaned out, what do you think we should do with all this excess grease?

15596,Mr. Krabs,130," Hmm.

Stops by the sign] What the? [puts on reading glasses] Try Plankton's... new delicerous... Chummy Patties... now with edible flavor? [sniffs air] Clearly somethin' crabby is goin' on here.
",7
15610,Plankton,130," [in Chum Bucket] Next Chumstomer, please. [sees Mr. Krabs and is a little surprised] Well, Well, Eugene Krabs!
",7
15611,Mr. Krabs,130," Save the formalities for your mother-in-law, Plankton! Yeh stole my Krabby Patty Formuler, and I want it back!
",7
15612,Plankton,130," Sorry to disappoint, Krabs, but I've done no such thing. I'm simply using a gift somebody left me to make my chum taste good.
",7
15613,Mr. Krabs,130," A gift?
",7
15614,Plankton,130," Sheh! It's almost like I got a personal visit from the Flavor Fairy!

15615,Mr. Krabs,130," [stunned, but then a little aggravated] Be that as it may, Plankton! It takes 2 to tango.

15617,Mr. Krabs,130," [opens door] SpongeBob! Stop what you're doing!
",7
15618,SpongeBob,130," But Mr. Krabs, I'm not doing anything!
",7
15619,Mr. Krabs,130," Never mind that now, I've got some new directions for yeh. From now on, I want you to fry up [pulls two patties from behind back] two Patties for every Krabby Patty we sell! [drops one patty on grill] One for the patty itself, and the [drops second patty on grill] second, just for the grease! Then, [picks up second patty and starts scraping it of with spatula] slather the grease from the second patty onto the first one and [tosses second patty away] Voalora! It's A deluxe Krabby Patty with extra flavor! [SpongeBob burns eye from grease coming on it]
",7
15620,SpongeBob,130," [holding eye] Mr. Krabs, do you think it might be kinda... unhealthy to be feeding people all this grease?
",7
15621,Mr. Krabs,130," Unhealthy? Boy, didn't anybody tell yeh?
",7
15622,SpongeBob,130," Tell me what, sir?
",7
15623,Mr. Krabs,130," Questions are a danger to you... [holds out spatula] and a burden to others. [hands SpongeBob's spatula and walks away]
",7
15624,Mr. Krabs,130," Lil' lower! Lil' more! More! Lil' more! Okay, A little to the left now! Up a bit! Okay wait, that's too far. Alright, alright, perfect, right there!
",7
15625,Squidward,130," Mr. Krabs, I hope whatever you're yelling about is something more important than my mid-morning nap!
",7
15626,Mr. Krabs,130," Just hangin' a new sign, Squidward! [worker unveils sign that says ‘Now Serving! DELUXE Krabby Patties!’]
",7
15627,Squidward,130," Deluxe Krabby Patties. [in sarcasm] Juuust what the world needed.
",7
15628,Mr. Krabs,130," Shh! Okay, a little higher now!

15629,Harold,130," Hey, look at that!

15633,Harold,130," A little to the right...
",7
15634,Nat,130," Oh okay, I see it!
",7
15635,Harold,130," [to crowd] There's an new sign up at the Krusty Krab! It says they're serving something called a deluxe Krabby Patty!
",7
15636,Nat,130," That sounds delicious!
",7
15637,Harold,130," You're telling me, I'm gonna try one! [runs to the Krusty Krab and then whole line of fish runs to Krusty Krab]
",7
15638,Plankton,130," Next Chumstomer in line, please! [zoom out of empty Chum Bucket] Hello? [seat falls over]
",7
15639,Frankie Billy,130," These are delicious!
",7
15640,Norma,130," Right! I can't imagine what makes them taste so good! [bites into deluxe Krabby Patty]
",7
15641,Plankton,130," [puts down telescope] Well, well, well, now I do see what Krabs meant when he said two could play that game. But he's a bigger fool than he realizes if he thinks old Plankton it gonna take this one lying down! [looks down, and stands up] Uhhh... Meh
",7
15642,Harold,130," Man am I stuffed!
",7
15643,Frank,130," Me, too! But that deluxe Krabby Patty was so swimmin' good, I'm gonna get another one!
",7
15644,Harold,130," Sounds like a plan!
",7
15645,Nat,130," Hold it, what's that sign say?
",7
15646,Mr. Krabs,130," Quadruple goodness?! [mumbles] We'll see about that. [in the Krusty Krab, we see SpongeBob, sweating and cooking Krabby Patties] Keep the grill goin' nonstop to crank out as much grease as possible!
",7
15647,SpongeBob,130," Okay Mr. Krabs. I never turn the grill off but I can turn it off even less than that if you want.
",7
15648,Mr. Krabs,130," Uhh... I already see the... [slips on grease] Whoa! [clattering sound] Gribbets Mollusk! [picks up greasy bun] Eeeagh! What in the name of Neptune is this?
",7
15649,SpongeBob,130," Sorry Mr. Krabs. I accidentally dropped some buns into our vat of extra grease. They've been soakin' there for about an hour. [Eugene smiles]
",7
15650,[sign outside the Krusty Krab that says,130," ""New! Yummy Bunz over an Hour of flavor in every bun""]
",7
15651,Plankton,130," Yummy Bunz huh? Well you're gonna have to try a lot harder than that Krabs, once the hungry public hears about MY newest creation.
",7
15652,Karen,130," Creation? My scanner shows that's nothing more than a burnt grease crumb.
",7
15653,Plankton,130," You're right! And it's packed with flavor!
",7
15654,Squidward,130," P.U, Mr. Krabs!
",7
15655,Mr. Krabs,130," Huh?
",7
15656,Squidward,130," Don't you usually flush that stuff down the toilet?
",7
15657,Mr. Krabs,130," This is our latest product! It's pure grease on a paper plate!
",7
15658,Squidward,130," I'll give you points for honesty.
",7
15659,Mr. Krabs,130," SpongeBob! Get those seven orders of Wow soup out to table 3 pronto! We gotta keep these customers happy or Plankton will steal them back!
",7
15660,Frank,130," Are you going to eat that?
",7
15661,SpongeBob,130," It was supposed to be going to table 3.
",7
15662,Frank,130," Okay.
",7
15663,Mr. Krabs,130," [startles SpongeBob] SpongeBob! [SpongeBob flips the plate over and the grease lands back on the plate]
",7
15664,SpongeBob,130," Sir yes sir!
",7
15665,Mr. Krabs,130," Are you gonna get that soup served to table 3 or are you gonna wait til it gets up and walks there itself?
",7
15666,SpongeBob,130," Actually, Mr. Krabs, I've been thinking. And well, don't you think maybe this whole grease thing has gone a bit to far? [Mr. Krabs laughs]
",7
15667,Mr. Krabs,130," You know what I think SpongeBob? I think you should be thinking about NOT thinking and get back to work! [Patrick stumbles in fat and grease-covered]
",7
15668,Patrick,130," Gotta... Have... Crunchity... Munchities... [Patrick falls over and SpongeBob runs to his side]
",7
15669,SpongeBob,130," PATRICK! Oh no! Not my best friend too! [he gets an assertive look on his face. Cut to a health inspector riding in on the truck. He finds the entire area is covered in grease]
",7
15670,Mr. Krabs,130," [gasp] Oh no! Did somebody call the health inspector?!
",7
15671,Plankton,130," Oh no! Did somebody call the health inspector?
",7
15672,Health inspector,130," Did somebody call a... Health inspector?
",7
15673,SpongeBob,130," It was me sir. I just wanted to tell you that... Well, for the past two weeks, Plankton and Mr. Krabs have been... [short pause] they've been feeding people grea... [he's cut off as Mr. Krabs picks him up and throws him in an attempt to shut him up. The health inspector wants to know whats going on and they tell him nothing just a friendly competition between old friends. SpongeBob tries to say they've been feeding people grease 3 times until he falls off a cliff and they can no longer shut him up]
",7
15674,SpongeBob,130," They're feeding people grease.
",7
15675,Health inspector,130," Well! I thought I recognized this horrible stench. But I thought that maybe just one of you two hadn't showered in a while.
",7
15676,Plankton,130," Uh, Officer! Officer I would just like to state for the record that umm, [points to Mr. Krabs] this was all his idea! All of it!
",7
15677,Health inspector,130," Oh really? Well in that case you'll be happy to know I'll be ordering BOTH of your restaurants to be closed down until the two of you slime balls can clean up your act! [climbs in his truck] Good day. [as he leaves he gets grease all over Mr. Krabs and Plankton]
",7
15678,Plankton,130," Well I'm taking a bath. [he walks off as SpongeBob walks in with his hat in his hands and a sad look on his face]
",7
15679,Mr. Krabs,130," I guess this is it boy. The end of an era.
",7
15680,SpongeBob,130," No, it's not the end, Mr. Krabs.
",7
15681,Mr. Krabs,130," It is. Unless I can find a way to get this grease soaked up. [SpongeBob gets an idea]
",7
15682,SpongeBob,130," Wait a minute. Did you say soaked up?
",7
15683,Mr. Krabs,130," Oh what difference does it make?
",7
15684,SpongeBob,130," [with a giddy look on his face] You'll see!
",7
15685,Mr. Krabs,130," Ah. It was all a dream! [SpongeBob appears full of grease]
",7
15686,SpongeBob,130," No it wasn't Mr. Krabs! I soaked up all the offending substances from the surrounding area and I'm gonna go dispose of them properly. The Krusty Krab is grease free! [Patrick runs up to him and sees that hes full of grease and he starts licking SpongeBob] Patrick No! [he ignores this and licks his hand]
",7
15687,Patrick,130," Mmm. Crunchity Munchities!
",7
15688,SpongeBob,130, Stop it! Stop it! Go away! No! No! [SpongeBob runs away with Patrick in tow. Mr. Krabs has a look on his face],7

",7
15892,Sandy,132," What you need is a mediator. Y'all bet to sit down and work this out. Now the main problem in an argument is a lack of communication.

",7
16052,Patrick,134," So what you're saying is, that if they go though with their plans, to build this new superhighway through Jellyfish Fields, that every single specie of flora & fauna that makes this place their habitat will be forced out of the ecosystem that they have formed, effectively being destroyed?

16053,SpongeBob,134," Well, yeah, that's a simplified version, but yeah, something like that [angrily takes off goggles] which is why I hereby make this solemn vow to stop this so-called, ""Shelly Super Highway,"" from ever being built!

16093,Plankton,134," Well, that certainly was an interesting series of words that just tumbled out past your teeth and lips, but frankly, my dear sponge, I don't give a barnacle.

16095,Mr. Krabs,134," I don't know.

16122,SpongeBob,134," What was that?
",7
16123,Patrick,134," Oh, it's when a bunch of people go walkin' on a street, an-
",7
16124,SpongeBob,134," [annoyed] I know what a freedom march is, Patrick! I mean, what did he say?
",7
16125,Patrick,134," Oh, [chuckles]. He said, ""Let not your heart walk away from you, lest your mind grow legs and follow it.""
",7
16126,SpongeBob,134," [impressed] Wow. Your uncle sounds like a pretty smart guy, Patrick! What happened after he was arrested?
",7
16127,Patrick,134," I don't know, because no one one ever heard from him again. [SpongeBob looks nervous. the police car stops in the middle of nowhere and throws SpongeBob and Patrick out, and then drive away, kicking up dust and blowing away their clothes, leaving them in their underwear]
",7
16128,Police Fish #1,134," See ya later, longhairs! [drives away]
",7
16129,Patrick and SpongeBob,134," Bye!
",7
16130,SpongeBob,134," See you later!
",7
16131,Patrick,134," [laughs] It's a wig!
",7
16132,SpongeBob,134," Thanks for the lift!
",7
16133,SpongeBob,134," [horrified] They left us, out here in the middle of nowhere!
",7
16134,SpongeBob,134," [smiles weakly] Well, at least it ain't raining!
",7
16135,SpongeBob,134," [angrily] I'm not ready to give up just yet!
",7
16136,Patrick,134," [gleefully] I am!
",7
16137,SpongeBob,134," If we could just come up with a better way to reach the people, something everyone can see and hear!
",7
16138,Patrick,134," You mean like a parade?
",7
16139,SpongeBob,134," Oh, a parade! Patrick, how did you come up with such a brilliant idea?
",7
16140,Patrick,134," [points to the left] There's one going by right there. [shows two fish with a banner saying ""Shelly Super Highway""; followed by a marching band; followed by a float and the circus; followed by Santa on a tropical island on a limo; followed by a herd of senior citizens being whipped at by the two wrestlers from Krusty Krushers; followed by a group of Scottish fish playing bagpipes; followed by some clown fish and a cat parade balloon; followed by a choir; and finally followed by a heavy metal rock band.
",7
16141,SpongeBob,134," That certainly is a parade!
",7
16142,Patrick,134," [points] Look!
",7
16143,SpongeBob,134," [gasps at Plankton in a complex paver/bulldozer hybrid following everyone] Plankton! Driving a big tractor! This doesn't look good at all, Patrick.
",7
16144,Patrick,134," Does this?! [flexes his back]
",7
16145,SpongeBob,134," C'mon! Let's go follow them! [he and Patrick follow the parade. the parade stops, and Plankton gets out a loud speaker]
",7
16146,Plankton,134," [ahem] People of Bikini Bottom-[crowd starts to murmur and ignore him, until a Scottish fish points at him] Today marks the new-[is cut of again by the crowd] STOP MURMURING!! [everyone is silent] Thank you. And as I was saying, today marks the beginning of a new- [is interrupted by the crowd singing, ""For He's A Jolly Good Fellow""] SHUT UP!!!!!! [crowd shuts up immediately, ahems] As I was saying, today marks a new beginning for Bikini Bottom! [crowd cheers and confetti falls] Now, its time to pave our way down the road to success! [starts the paver/bulldozer hybrid while the band plays, and starts to make the highway, which makes all of the jellyfish pack their bags and fly away; he laughs evilly. sniffs the air, and then sighs] Ah, I love the smell of hot tar in the morning! Yeah, baby! [stops in front of a matador with his hat covering his face] Hey, you there! are you trying to get yourself crushed!?
",7
16147,SpongeBob,134," [furious] I won't let you do it, Plankton! If you're going to pave over Jellyfish Fields, you're going to have to pave over me first! [shows he and Plankton dramatically locking eyes, and quickly shows some surprised members of the parade]
",7
16148,Plankton,134," [simply smiles] Well, then; Your wish is my command, Sponge! [angrily pushes levers forward, crushing SpongeBob. shows SpongeBob crushed, clearly in agony]
",7
16149,SpongeBob,134," [weakly] Is that all you got? [is than immediately covered in tar; next scene shows the parade continuing, Plankton still paving, the jellyfish moving, and Jellyfish Fields being transformed into a desolate, lifeless wasteland. SpongeBob gets out of a manhole, looking very sad, and sees Patrick playing a trumpet]
",7
16150,SpongeBob,134," [annoyed] Knock it off, Patrick.
",7
16151,Mr. Krabs,134," [miserable] I used to dream of me restaurant with ""easy highway access!""
",7
16152,SpongeBob,134," [looks sad too] Yeah, but this is more like ""highway excess!""
",7
16153,Squidward,134," [shows up] Well, I'm going to go soak my tentacles. [shivers] It's cold in here underneath all of this concrete!
",7
16154,Mr. Krabs,134," [looks hopeful] But Squidward, you can't leave! What if we have, a customer?
",7
16155,Squidward,134," [sarcastically] Really. We haven't had a customer since the day this highway was built!
",7
16156,SpongeBob,134," [sheepishly] Well, actually, Squidward, it's called a super-highway.
",7
16157,Squidward,134," [angrily] I don't care what it is! I'm out of here!
",7
16158,SpongeBob,134," [shocked] But Squidward- [is interrupted by Mr. Krabs]
",7
16159,Mr. Krabs,134," [looks sad] No, SpongeBob. Squidward's right. [gets up and walks to his office] It's high time we started accepting facts. [SpongeBob runs over to a fax machine and pulls out a new one]
",7
16160,SpongeBob,134," [smiles] I'm on it, Mr. Krabs!
",7
16161,Mr. Krabs,134," [annoyed] No, boyo! Not that kind!
",7
16162,SpongeBob,134," [confused] Mr. Krabs, what are you saying?
",7
16163,Mr. Krabs,134," [darkly] The Krusty Krab can't stay in business. Not like this.
",7
16164,SpongeBob,134," It can't?
",7
16165,Mr. Krabs,134," No, SpongeBob. And its time to activate Plan Zed-9er9er.
",7
16166,SpongeBob,134," Zed-9er9er!!!??? [is horrified, and his eyes nearly shoots out of his head, and falls in Squidward's hands]
",7
16167,Squidward,134," Eugene, what is Zed-9er9er!!?? And more importantly, how does it affect me!?
",7
16168,Mr. Krabs,134," Plan Zed-9er9er is, I'm-[is interrupted by traffic honking and driving] I'm-[is interrupted again, and than yells quickly during next honking spot] I'M SELLING THE KRABBY PATTY SECRET FORMULA TO PLANKTON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
",7
16169,Squidward,134," [shocked] Eugene!
",7
16170,Mr. Krabs,134," [sadly] I have no choice. And stop calling me Eugene. [walks out of Krusty Krab]
",7
16171,SpongeBob,134," Tell me I'm dreaming! [moans]
",7
16172,Squidward,134," [looks sad] Not this time, little fella. [sniffles. shows Mr. Krabs outside, and changes the ""Open"" sign to say ""Closed"" as he sobs. Cut to the Chum Bucket, where Plankton is rich, successful, and getting a back massage from his wife via a electric plug]
",7
16173,Plankton,134," Uh lower, a little lower, yeah, that's it! [doorbell is rung, and rides to the door on a segway] Now who could that be during my hour of triumph? [shows a miserable Mr. Krabs holding the Secret Formula] How appropriate. [snickers]
",7
16174,Mr. Krabs,134," Plankton, I'm ready to negoitiate a price for me secret formula.
",7
16175,Plankton,134," Oh sure! [gets out a large pocketwatch] Let me just wind my watch!
",7
16176,Mr. Krabs,134," [very sad] What for?
",7
16177,Plankton,134," [gleefully] Cause I'm gonna love every minute of this! [a faint buzzing is heard] Did you hear that?
",7
16178,Mr. Krabs,134," What?
",7
16179,Plankton,134," Karen, is that you??
",7
16180,Mr. Krabs,134," [points up to a vent] Up there! [a massive amount of jellyfish come out of it] Whoa, nelly!!!
",7
16181,SpongeBob,134," [Outside] First, I lost Jellyfish fields, and- and......
",7
16182,Squidward,134," And what?
",7
16183,SpongeBob,134," [in a sobbing mess] AND NOW I LOST THE ONLY JOB I EVER WANTED!!!!!! [Cries]

16184,Squidward,134," Look on the bright side, at least I don't have to put up with you anymore! Ha,ha! This could be the start of something beautiful![jellyfish stings him] OW! What the-!
",7
16185,SpongeBob,134," [gleefully]Look! All the jellyfish who used to live in Jellyfish Fields are coming to Bikini Bottom!
",7
16186,Squidward,134," Yeah, but for some reason, I don't think they're here to trade gift baskets!
",7
16187,SpongeBob,134," Aw, ya don't?[Both run away as the town turns into chaos]
",7
16188,Mr. Krabs,134," [back in the Chum Bucket] You know something, Plankton? Maybe we can talk about this later. I think I'm just gonna run for me life.[runs out the door, closing it behind him]
",7
16189,Plankton,134," WAIT! I'M COMIN' WITH YOU! [before Plankton can escape, the jellyfish grab him]NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!! [jellyfish sting him] NOT THE EYE,' NOT THE EYE!!!!
",7
16190,Ben,134," Chaos runs rampage in Bikini Bottom. [ducks down from jellyfish] That's right folks, this is news reporter, Ben Blenny standing in for Perch Perkins who's out today with a terrible case of indigestion and we are coming to you live during day 3 of what appears to be Bikini Bottom's worst-

16197,SpongeBob,134," Well okay, I guess, sorry I am a little nervous.
",7
16198,Ben,134," That's understandable, just speak loud and clear.
",7
16199,SpongeBob,134," Well all I have to say is that um, well, STOP THE MADNESS! We need to get Jellyfish Fields back to the jellyfish, which will restore their natural habitat so they will be in peace. So what do you say everybody, will you help me?

16200,Everybody,134," No!

16201,SpongeBob,134," [Confused] You're kidding, right?

16202,Everybody,134," Yes! [Everybody runs over the cameraman to Jellyfish Fields.. Scene cuts to SpongeBob in the tractor ready to tear down the Shelly Superhighway]

16203,SpongeBob,134," All right everyone, say goodbye to the worst thing that's happened to Bikini Bottom since those 99 cent stores.
",7
16204,Everyone,134," Yeah! [SpongeBob tries to break the highway with the tractor but it just stopped!]

16298,SpongeBob 1,135," Yes Patrick we were all born in our places of time. Hello fellas citizen. Hello Squilliam.

16299,Squilliam,135," Man Ray is great.

16300,SpongeBob 1,135," Yeah. Must be taking care of his oppugations.

16302,SpongeBob 1,135," I uh Patrick do you notice anything different about our prison.
",7
16303,Patrick 1,135," Sorry I couldn’t hear you over the clatter of prison chains.
",7
16304,SpongeBob 1,135," I said is there something odd about Bikini Bottom since we got back.
",7
16305,Patrick 1,135," No! But yes! Just look at the giant medicine billboard. It’s missing a bolt on the bottom right corner.
",7
16306,SpongeBob 1,135," Even worse than that Patrick. The police got new uniforms.
",7
16307,Patrick 1,135," Oh no! What did they do with those old ones?
",7
16308,SpongeBob 1,135," Ah ye. What happened to the Krusty Krab? [Reads the sign] The designed area where you are permitted by Man Ray, your ruler, to obtain sandwiches using Man Ray dollars? The city under life, tradity, and all this.
",7
16309,Patrick 1,135," I’m out of Man Ray dollars?
",7
16310,SpongeBob 1,135," No Patrick it means we somehow changed the course of history when we went to the past well, in this reality Man Ray is ruler. Oh we got to do something.
",7
16311,Patrick 1,135," For what?
",7
16312,SpongeBob 1,135," One of these suspecting citizens of the 3-World that do in a time crisis. See if I still have a job.

16318,Mermaid Man,135," [Rings the bell] Order up.
",7
16319,SpongeBob 1,135," Mermaid Man is wearing a hairnet. What happened? Why are the two greatest heroes ever stuck in this greasy spoon not combating the evils of Man Ray?
",7
16320,Mermaid Man,135," I lost a desire and enough physique to fight long ago kid. Flipping patties is so much easier on the joints when you’re my age.
",7

16324,Barnacle Boy,135," I hate to break up the memorial service but we’re out of tartar sauce out here.
",7
16325,Mermaid Man,135," Tartar Sauce? The topping that destroyed life as we knew it. If only my tartar sauce attack hadn’t failed that day, we wouldn’t be living in this wasteland. We’re already out.
",7
16326,Patrick 1,135," Yep. It’s chewy that’s... [Burps]

16327,Mermaid Man,135," I knew I recognized you from somewhere and you ate that tartar sauce on that day. You realized what you’ve done.
",7
16328,SpongeBob 1,135," Sorry Mermaid Man we didn’t mean to destroy your lives you held dear. What do we say to try to make things right. With your help of course.

",7
16330,SpongeBob 1,135," Does that mean the defeat was so traumatic that it has given Man Ray a stranglehold on your psyche?
",7
16331,Mermaid Man ,135," Barnacle... No! It means he put the electrical collar on me that won’t allow me to leave the restaurant.

16336,SpongeBob 1,135," [Mermaid Man gets a bump on his head] Ta-daaa! You're free! Now can we coax you and Barnacle Boy out of retirement to save the new universe?
",7
16337,Mermaid Man,135," I suppose you’ve proven your medal but, I’ll have my eye on you two. Now let’s pop that Dirty Bubble.
",7
16338,SpongeBob 1,135," Actually we’re fighting Man Ray.
",7
16339,Mermaid Man,135," Well in that case let the light house of justice shine on Ray Man.

It’s not every day I get to defeat Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy 3 times over. [is about to shoot two SpongeBobs, Patrick, two Old Mermaid Mans and Barnacle Boys but another locker comes]
",7
16360,SpongeBob 2,135," [He along with the second Patrick comes out of the machine] Patrick don’t eat the tartar sauce.
",7
16361,Second Man Ray,135," You’re too late. Your fat friend beat you to it. Now prepare to taste the laser. [another time machine comes, which it opens, and the third SpongeBob and Patrick are falling, screaming] So how...

16362,SpongeBob 4,135," [The time machine door with the fourth SpongeBob and Patrick] I told you we had to go back farther.

16370,Second Man Ray,135," I’m sorry, did you say something? I’m still trying to comprehend what just happened here.
",7
16371,Young Mermaid Man,135," It’s pretty simple really. You were defeated by a Conroy of time cruising crime stoppers. Thank you SpongeBob and Patrick.

[he cries profusely, and continuously like a fountain, leaving a puddle surrounding him] I stubbed my toe! I was walking around and I stubbed my toe! [later, he walks into his closet and searches though a long line of identical SquarePants while humming; he picks one, but the wire hanger rips through the side] D'oh, that was my favorite shirt.

16390,Mr. Krabs,136," [enters abruptly, startling SpongeBob, who flips the patty into the air] SpongeBob, guess what? [the patty lands on the ground] Yeah, I'll come back later. [goes back into his office, SpongeBob sadly picks the patty up by his spatula and carries it to the trash bin]
",7
16391,SpongeBob,136," He was a good little Krabby Patty. [sniffs] I didn't know him well, but in the few short seconds between grill and floor, I--[opens the trash lid and begins crying]--I came to love him! [the patty slowly slides off his spatula and into the trash bin] It just isn't fair! [he cries even louder, soaking and enraging Squidward from the counter window]

16395,SpongeBob,136," [stifled] You yelled at me! YOU YELLED AT ME! [sobs loudly, continuing to soak Squidward with tears while Squidward gives us a depressed look on his face realizing yelling isn't going to help]
",7
16396,SpongeBob,136," And you wrote that number on a chalkboard.
",7
16397,Squidward,136," Yes!
",7
16398,SpongeBob,136," Why?
",7
16399,Squidward,136," [pauses for a second] I have no idea.
",7
16400,SpongeBob,136," Oh, Squidward, there's no way I cry that much. There's not that many tears in my brain.

16401,Squidward,136," Au contraire. [turns on a TV]
",7
16402,SpongeBob,136," What's this?

16403,Squidward,136," It's a quick montage of flashbacks I've edited together that shows the hundreds of tears you have cried over the years.

16415,SpongeBob,136," Okay, great, thanks Patrick.

16416,Patrick,136," Umm... sure. And did you remember to put that package outside where I told you?
",7
16417,SpongeBob,136," Yeah, but I left it in a different spot. Just ask Gary, he knows where it is.
",7
16418,Patrick,136," Oh, yeah. [laughs with his mouth full] Hey, good one, buddy. You almost had me there.
",7
16419,SpongeBob,136," [chuckles] Okay.

16420,Patrick,136," Yeah, talk to you later.

16421,SpongeBob,136," All right, see ya. [hangs up, then walks back up to Squidward] Okay, it's a bet.
",7
16422,Squidward,136," [shakes SpongeBob's hand] Fine. If you cry one tear before midnight, you have to... [thinks] Wash my bike, clean out my rain gutters, and do all my yard work for a year.
",7
16423,SpongeBob,136," Sounds fair to me. And if I make it to midnight without crying, you'll come to a slumber party at my place. Just you and me. [Squidward retches and swallows] Ooh, what's the matter?
",7
16424,Squidward,136," Um, nothing, I just threw up a little in my mouth. [begins talking in his thoughts] No need to worry, Squiddy. You've outdone yourself. He'll be crying in ten minutes. [laughs out loud; in the evening, he and SpongeBob are now walking home from work]
",7
16425,SpongeBob,136," Thanks again for walking with me, Squidward.

16426,Squidward,136," There's a first time for everything. [under his breath] Also, I'd like to win this bet as soon as possible. [chuckles devilishly]

16427,SpongeBob,136," [speaking in his thoughts] I am not gonna cry. I am not gonna cry. [straining, he speaks out loud] I can do this.
",7
16428,Squidward,136," [smiling] Do what? [sees something and gasps] Oh, my! What a lovely sunset. Take a look, SpongeBob. [SpongeBob looks at the sunset and gasps] Isn't that beautiful?
",7
16429,SpongeBob,136," I've never seen such a beautiful underwater sunset.
",7
16430,Squidward,136," Really tugs the heartstrings, doesn't it?

16432,Squidward,136," Is that a tear I see? [the sunset disappears]
",7
16433,SpongeBob,136," Oh, well, sunset's over. [walks off, Squidward scoffs in frustration; later, they both enter SpongeBob's house] Nice of you to drop in, neighbor.
",7
16434,Squidward,136," Nice of you to have me, I--[sees something] Oh, look SpongeBob. Gary's sleeping.
",7
16435,SpongeBob,136," [with his hands together, up to his mouth] Aww. He looks like an angel.
",7
16436,Squidward,136," That is just so adorable. Almost makes you want to cry.
",7
16437,SpongeBob,136," Yeah. [snaps out of it] No! There shall be no tears in this house tonight! [walks off into the kitchen] La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.

16442,Squidward,136," [reading the postcard] ""Dear SpongeBob, we are having a wonderful time in the South Seas and we miss you very, very much.

16443,SpongeBob,136," [teary-eyed at first] Ohh. [grabs another postcard] My subscription to Jellyfishing Monthly's expired. Remind me to renew that, will you, Squidward?

16450,Anchor Fish,136," Coming up, an interview with a manatee who didn't get what he wanted for his birthday.

16451,SpongeBob,136," [sad again] Oh, no.

16452,Anchor Fish,136," And finally, sad news for Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy fans.
",7
16453,SpongeBob,136," [voice breaks] What, what, what?
",7
16454,Anchor Fish,136," They will only be showing The Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Show seven times a day instead of eight—
",7
16455,SpongeBob,136," [sweating, changes the channel] Let's watch something else Squidward, okay?
",7
16456,Squidward,136," Fine!

16457,Kid Fish,136," Hey, Dad, how about a game of catch? [he throws the baseball in front of his bored dad]

16458,Unnamed father,136," Sorry, son, I'm late for work.

16459,Kid Fish,136," [disappointedly] Okay, Dad. [his dad throws the baseball back]

16460,Unnamed father,136," [tosses his briefcase] I guess I can stay for a few throws.

16463,SpongeBob,136," [to Squidward] You know what they say about that television. Rots the brain.

16464,Squidward,136," It's getting late. I'd better bring out the big guns. [out loud] Oh, SpongeBob.
",7
16465,SpongeBob,136," Yes, Squidward?
",7
16466,Squidward,136," What would you say to a little music? [pulls out his clarinet]
",7
16467,SpongeBob,136," [gasps happily] I'd say... I'll go get some refreshments. [walks off]
",7
16468,Squidward,136," Don't be long. My secret weapon is waiting. [gets out sheet music titled ""Hearts & Flowers (or Some Such Sad Song)"", then chuckles]
",7
16469,SpongeBob,136," [appears, holding a tray of tea] You said something, Squidward?
",7
16470,Squidward,136," Oh, I just said, ""Relax and enjoy the song."" [he begins playing the such sad song on his clarinet, SpongeBob goes stifled, trying to fight back tears, Squidward strains hard playing the last single note, then pants]
",7
16471,SpongeBob,136," That's a really sad song, Squidward.
",7
16472,Squidward,136," You're not gonna cry though, are you?
",7
16473,Squidward,136," [nervously] Uh, SpongeBob. No-no-no-no, wait.
",7
16474,SpongeBob,136," Yes, Squidward?
",7
16475,Squidward,136," How about a bedtime story?
",7
16476,SpongeBob,136," Now you're talking! [later in his room, he lays in bed with Squidward] Whatcha gonna read me, Squidward?
",7
16477,Squidward,136," Umm... [nervously searches through the pages] How 'bout The Little Angler Who Got Lost?
",7
16478,SpongeBob,136," That sounds like a very sad story.
",7
16479,Squidward,136," Oh, very sad. Umm... ""There once was a little angler [the page he's reading is actually of the story Jack and Jill] who was, uh, little and sad. [SpongeBob whimpers] One day the little sad angler was walking through the park. [SpongeBob begins to chuckle with joy]
",7
16480,SpongeBob,136," Walking...
",7
16481,Squidward,136," But, he was sad, because...because he was lost... he was lost and very sad. And then, he— he started to cry. [SpongeBob begins to choke up] He cried and he cried. And he cried even more. [SpongeBob shakes with sadness] And he kept crying... [SpongeBob strains and forces back tears] ...and crying and crying and crying and...that's right. You can do it.
",7
16482,SpongeBob,136," I'm wondering if it might not be so healthy to hold in all my tears, Squidward.
",7
16483,Squidward,136," You're exactly right, SpongeBob. Let it all out. Don't fight the feel--[the second hand on the clock ticks closer to midnight] Ten, nine...do it, do it, cry...eight, seven, six, five...come on! [the dam inside SpongeBob's brain begins to crack] ...four, three, two, one! [the dam breaks, and a river of tears begins to rush out] Midnight! [sighs, SpongeBob's body is turning wide] Well, SpongeBob, it looks like you won the... [SpongeBob's eyes burst with tears, shooting a flood towards Squidward and smacking him against the wall. The tears shoot out the windows, door crack, chimney, and other holes in his house. They spread to Patrick's house, causing an entire waterfall inside]
",7
16484,Patrick,136," Wow, what a great show.
",7
16485,Mr. Krabs,136," [standing on his desk, holding a fat stack of money away from the tears] Well, at least we're still together, little ones.
",7
16486,SpongeBob,136," [holding out a bowl of popcorn] More popcorn, Squidward?
",7
16487,Squidward,136," No, no. No, no. Please.

16488,SpongeBob,136," [eating popcorn] Don't be shy now. I made extra. [Squidward begins to whimper, SpongeBob rubs his shoulders] That's all right, let it out. You can cry all you want. You're among friends here.

16508,Plankton,137," Oh well, I have other ways of getting it when I need where is the formula Krabs? [tickles Mr. Krabs with feather]
",7
16509,Mr. Krabs,137," Ha ha ha ha!
",7
16510,Plankton,137," Still not going to talk 'ay' Krabs? [He tickles Mr. Krabs' nose with the feather causing him to sneeze and blowing Plankton to the ground] OK Krabs, I see you're still not going to crack but I don't think your underling is of the same metal.
",7
16511,SpongeBob,137," I'll never talk.
",7
16512,Plankton,137," Well, we'll see what Mr. Feather has to say about that.
",7
16513,SpongeBob,137," OK, OK! but I don't how to get into the safe behind the painting in Mr. Krabs' office that houses the secret formula! He won't let me near it!
",7
16514,Plankton,137," Clever, behind the painting ay Krabs?
",7
16515,Mr. Krabs,137," Errrrrrrr...
",7
16516,Plankton,137," [sniffs] Say what am I smelling? you got something burning?
",7
16517,SpongeBob,137," [sniffs] Smells like blubber to me.
",7
16518,Plankton,137," Bl bl blubber?
",7
16519,Pearl,137," Daddy!
",7
16520,Plankton,137," Ahhhhh! Call off your daughter Krabs! Call her off!
",7
16521,Mr. Krabs,137," She's a big girl Plankton, I have no control over what she does. Oh, And you better watch out. I think she's extra hungry today.
",7
16522,Plankton,137," Stay back whale! I'm pippy to what you do to organisms like me. I've seen those documentaries! [As he say this he backs up into the freezer]
",7
16523,Pearl,137," Did he just go into the freezer?
",7
16524,Plankton,137," [exits freezer and walks out the door] Don't say it!
",7
16525,Pearl,137," I prefer salad over Plankton anyway.
",7
16526,Mr. Krabs,137," Who knew Plankton was so afraid of whales? [chuckles evilly] Pearl me darling daughter, you saved my business and my Formular now get us out of this trap.
",7
16527,Pearl,137," Mall money.
",7
16528,Mr. Krabs,137," Alright, alright. You're gettin' more like your old man every day. [gives dollar to Pearl]. Pearl, why don't you swing to the Chum Bucket on your way to the mall? Give Plankton a little scare?
",7
16529,Pearl,137," Double my mall money!
",7
16530,Mr. Krabs,137," [grunts] Alright, SpongeBob. It's your turn!
",7
16531,SpongeBob,137," Here you go, Pearl. Buy something pretty.
",7
16532,Pearl,137," Hey, this isn't money!
",7
16533,SpongeBob,137," No, it's even better! It's the money Mr. Krabs pays me with. [money is shown] Mr. Krabs' Wacky Bucks!
",7
16534,Mr. Krabs,137," [to self] It's all catching up to me... [to Pearl] Please, Pearl?
",7
16535,Pearl,137," No way! The Chum Bucket is, like, totally gross!
",7
16536,Mr. Krabs,137," Hmmm... in that case, I'll need to borrow one of your dressers.
",7
16537,SpongeBob & Pearl,137," Hummina-hunh?/Huh?!
",7
16538,Plankton,137," [runs inside]
",7
16539,Karen,137," My triumphant husband returns. How'd you fail this time?
",7
16540,Plankton,137," Krabs had a whale!
",7
16541,Karen,137," You mean his big, scary, teenage daughter?
",7
16542,Plankton,137," I hear that mocking tone in your voice Karen, and I don't appreciate it! Don't you remember what happened to my ancestors at the hands of those beasts?
",7
16543,Karen,137," OK When you take a break from your delusional paranoia, the trash needs some attention. It's ripened.
",7
16544,Pearl/Krabs,137," [emerges from dumpster] I'm hungry!
",7
16545,Plankton,137," [Screams. He runs back inside and bars the door] That should keep her out!
",7
16546,Pearl/Krabs,137," [sneaks up behind him] I want Plankton meat!
",7
16547,Plankton,137," Holy, protozoa! [runs out the lab] Karen! she's here! She got in!
",7
16548,Karen,137," What are you talking about?
",7
16549,Plankton,137," There's a whale in the laboratory!
",7
16550,Karen,137," Are you out of your mind?
",7
16551,Plankton,137," See for yourself!
",7
16552,Karen,137," [checks the lab] No whale in here.
",7
16553,Plankton,137," I swear! A whale was just in here. She was next to the transmutator. She was right here in this spot! Her mouth all frothy, her blowhole blowing!
",7
16554,Karen,137," Oh that's enough Plankton! If you'll excuse me, I have to get back to more permanent primary functions. [rolls away]
",7
16555,Plankton,137," Karen! Karen--!
",7
16556,Karen,137," I'm not listening! Hm hm hm!
",7
16557,Narrator,137," 16 Paranoia Filled Days Later...
",7
16558,Karen,137," [off microphone] Plankton, your dinner is ready. Plankton, can you hear me?
",7
16559,Plankton,137," Yes, Karen. I can hear you. Could you please bring it up? I can't risk stepping into the light. The whale might see me. [cries]
",7
16560,Pearl/Krabs,137," [laughs. Bubble transition to night]
",7
16561,Plankton,137," [Plankton is shown having a nightmare. He is seen being chased by Pearl and falls into her blowhole] Hey! Get me out of here! [Pearl flings him into her throat with her tongue. He falls into her stomach, where his ancestors find him]
",7
16562,Grand-Dad,137," Hey Plankton! Glad you could join the rest of the family!
",7
16563,Plankton,137," Grand-Dad?
",7
16564,Grand-Dad,137," Yep, and you're pretty brave standing in that there gastric acid.
",7
16565,Plankton,137," Gastric acid? [his body is half-burned] No! [wakes up from nightmare and screams] I can't take it! Oh, this is driving me crazy! [cries]
",7
16566,Pearl/Krabs,137," [takes off disguise and laughs. Bubble transition to morning]
",7
16567,SpongeBob,137," Hi, Plankton. Whatchya doin' laying on the middle of the road?
",7
16568,Plankton,137," Go away, CheeseHead! Can't you see I'm trying to get run over? In fact, better yet just step on me as hard as you can, will ya?
",7
16569,SpongeBob,137," I'm sorry, Plankton, but that flies in the face of my good nature.
",7
16570,Plankton,137," Forget it kid. I'll just wait for the next bus. Go on back to the Krusty Krab and enjoy yourself.
",7
16571,SpongeBob,137," Okay!
",7
16572,Mr. Krabs,137," [erases a picture of Plankton] Goodbye, Pipsqueak!
",7
16573,SpongeBob,137," Sorry to interrupt your gloating sir, I just thought it would be pertinent for you to know that Plankton is laying on the street, forlorn.
",7
16574,Mr. Krabs,137," Really? He's a mess! [laughs]
",7
16575,SpongeBob,137," Mr. Krabs, I know you and Plankton are both sworn enemies and all, but putting on a dress to frighten him? Isn't that taking it a little too far?
",7
16576,Mr. Krabs,137," May I remind you of the fact that you've disclosed the location of me safe, where I keep the secret formula?
",7
16577,Plankton,137," [angrily] Man, what does it take to get run over around here?!
",7
16578,SpongeBob,137," Hi, Plankton.
",7
16579,Plankton,137," What, do you have mud in your ears? Take a hike!
",7
16580,SpongeBob,137," Yes, I remember. But, I just wanted to tell that the secret formula is not, I repeat NOT, in the safe behind the painting in the Krusty Krab.
",7
16581,Plankton,137," What difference does it make? There's no point ever since I've been tortured by that blasted whale.
",7
16582,SpongeBob,137," Don't worry. Everyone has a secret fear! For instance, Mr. Krabs' secret fear is... [whispers in Plankton's ear]
",7
16583,Plankton,137," Really?
",7
16584,SpongeBob,137," Mmm Hmm, and guess what else?  that was Mr. Krabs in whale suit that you've been scared of.
",7
16585,Plankton,137," So, you're saying that this whole time it was Krabs masquerading as a whale!? [angerliy] Why that conniving bottomfeeder!
",7
16586,SpongeBob,137," But, certainly you wouldn't have use for such, innocuous information, would you?
",7
16587,Plankton,137," No, of course not.
",7
16588,SpongeBob,137," Well, back to your self-destructive behavior, Plankton. Thank you for this talk!
",7
16589,Plankton,137," No, no. Thank YOU! [laughs evilly. Bubble transition]
",7
16590,Mr. Krabs,137," This is almost too fun! [puts on costume] Plankton ain't even a challenge no more!
",7
16591,Plankton,137," Oh, is that so.
",7
16592,Mr. Krabs,137," Oh, Plankton. Back for more, aren'y ya? Okay, here it goes. [breaths deeply] Boo!
",7
16593,Plankton,137," You don't scare me, Krabs.
",7
16594,Mr. Krabs,137," I ain't Krabs, I'm... uh, I mean... [Pearl's voice] I'm Pearl, not Krabs.
",7
16595,Plankton,137," The jig is up, Krabs. I know all about the suit, AND your secret fear!
",7
16596,Mr. Krabs,137," Secret fear? [regular voice] What are you talkin' about?
",7
16597,Plankton,137," See for yourself. [the robotic arm squeezes Mr. Krabs] Enjoy the show! [a mime is shown]
",7
16598,Mr. Krabs,137," No. No. Muh-muh-make it stop! Please!
",7
16599,Plankton,137," Doesn't feel so good on the other end of the stick, doesn't it scaredy pants? I feel wonderful!
",7
16600,SpongeBob,137," Um, Plankton, if I were you I wouldn't be so smug.
",7
16601,Plankton,137," Why?
",7
16602,SpongeBob,137," Because a hungry pod of whales have just arrived for its early feeding. [whales are outside]
",7
16603,Plankton,137," [scared] Ahhhh! Not another feeding! Get me out of here! [removes a nail from the floor and jumps inside. SpongeBob puts a cork in the hole, turns off a projector, making the whales disappear, and gets Mr. Krabs out of the robot arm]
",7
16604,Mr. Krabs,137," Whew! You really redeemed yourself boy! [to mime] Okay, you're beginning to creep me out.",7

16630,Squidward,138," I'm holding a package from famous producer Buddy Barracuda. I sent him my play and now, he's gonna produce it!

16635,SpongeBob,138," Hey! Squidward! You're back from your amazing success as a playwriter!
",7
16636,SpongeBob,138," And your shirt, is that a cotton-poly blend? Faaancy!

16638,SpongeBob,138," Say, is that a copy of your play? Oh, my goodness! Are you going to put on your amazing play in our little old Krusty Krab? Oh, you are a true patron of the arts, Squidward!
",7
16639,Squidward,138," Well, I suppose that could work. If people see my play, they'll recognize my genius! And I'll become famous and-
",7
16640,Mr. Krabs,138," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Me customers come here for greasy food at high prices. Not for singin' and dancin'.
",7
16641,Squidward,138," But my play doesn't have singing-
",7
16642,SpongeBob,138," But, Mr. Krabs, people pay to eat, right?
",7
16643,Mr. Krabs,138," Of course.
",7
16644,SpongeBob,138," And they would pay to watch a play, right?
",7
16645,Mr. Krabs,138," Um, I suppose...
",7
16646,SpongeBob,138," Well, if they eat and watch a play, you can charge twice as much!
",7
16647,Mr. Krabs,138," Really? How about four times as much?
",7
16648,SpongeBob,138," Well, I don't see why not!
",7
16649,SpongeBob,138," Hmmm. Now what will we call this eating dinner and watching theater?

16651,Mr. Krabs,138," Oh, you. Oh, sure.
",7
16652,SpongeBob,138," No. Come on, let's get serious. We need a title that sounds...dramatic! Got it! We'll call it ""Singy Eaty Time!""

16654,Mr. Krabs,138," I love it!

16656,Mr. Krabs,138," And all of them willin' to work for no pay!
",7
16657,SpongeBob,138," Did I get the part?
",7
16658,Squidward,138," You got all the parts.

16671,Squidward,138," Go away, go away, shoo, shoo, go away, go away.
",7
16672,Mr. Krabs,138," What did I tell you? You do your job, or I'm shuttin' you down!
",7
16673,Squidward,138," Fine.
",7
16674,Squidward,138," He had promise until he came to work here, at the Krusty Krab. Serving local morons heart-stopping, artery-clogging garbage, masquerading as food.
",7
16675,Fish,138," Yay-hey!
",7
16676,Squidward,138," At the Krusty Krab, his talent was wasted.

16677,Nathaniel,138," Excuse me, can I get a refill?
",7
16678,Squidward,138," No, you ca-
",7
16679,Mr. Krabs,138," Squidward...
",7
16680,Squidward,138," Sigh...Yes, you can.
",7
16681,Squidward,138," But, who will refill the empty chasm in my soul?
",7
16682,Nathaniel,138," I...don't know, man...I don't know.
",7
16683,Squidward,138," His life shattered. Is there any task too demeaning for our hero?
",7
16684,Nat,138," Hey, my Krabby Patty doesn't have ketchup.
",7
16685,Squidward,138," It would appear not. No ketchup! That's terrible! Here, let me help you with that.
",7
16686,Squidward,138," Would any of you want this job?
",7
16687,Mr. Krabs,138," Squidward! You get that customer a fresh patty with ketchup! Now! And don't forget to charge him again!
",7
16688,Squidward,138," And then, there's my skinflint boss.
",7
16689,Mr. Krabs,138," What's that, Mr. Squidward?
",7
16690,Squidward,138," Umm, Mr. Krabs, I'm acting.
",7
16691,Mr. Krabs,138," Oh, well, that's OK, then. But get him a Krabby Patty!
",7
16692,Squidward,138," Fine. SpongeBob! One Krabby Patty with ketchup! And now, we come to the worst part of my job...working with him.
",7
16693,SpongeBob,138," Huh? Um, ahem, ah...I...uh...I forgot my lines!
",7
16694,Squidward,138," You don't have any lines!
",7
16695,SpongeBob,138," I don't?
",7
16696,Squidward,138," Doh! Just stand there and act like...yourself!
",7
16697,SpongeBob,138," Oh, I can do that! Ahem! One Krabby Patty coming up!
",7
16698,SpongeBob,138," [artificially] Oh, what is this. A stray wrapper in my kitchen.
",7
16699,SpongeBob,138," [artificially] Oh, the trash is full. I had better call...the garbage truck.
",7
16700,Squidward,138," [sarcastically] Talent.
",7
16701,Squidward,138," [sarcastically] Outstanding. Thank you, that'll do. Ahem. But, lo and behold-
",7
16702,Frankie Billy,138," Hey, man! Where's my Krabby Patty?
",7
16703,Squidward,138," His genius was unrecognized.
",7
16704,Frankie Billy,138," Come on, man! I just want my patty!
",7
16705,Nat,138," Yeah, me too!
",7
16706,Squidward,138," Taken for granted, uncredited, overlooked, ignored. Disrespected, unappreciated, unloved. But worst of all...underpaid.
",7
16707,Mr. Krabs,138," It's funny, 'cause it's true!
",7
16708,Nat,138," [whispering] He's done. Order.
",7
16709,Frankie Billy,138," Uh-
",7
16710,Squidward,138," And furthermore!
",7
16711,Nat,138," Oh, there's furthermore.
",7
16712,Squidward,138," Unfulfilled. In a word, his myriad of talents were, wasted.
",7
16713,Frankie Billy,138," Oh, come ON!
",7
16714,Fish mob,138," We want Krabby Patties! We want Krabby Patties! We want Krabby Patties! We want Krabby Patties!
",7
16715,Mr. Krabs,138," Squidward! You still haven't given me customers their Krabby Patties!
",7
16716,Squidward,138," All right! SpongeBob, where's that Patty?!
",7
16717,SpongeBob,138," What have I done? Have I let the lure of theatre production get between me and my patties?
",7
16718,Squidward,138," Uh huh.
",7
16719,SpongeBob,138," No, Squidward, no. Those patties aren't fit for public consumption.

16720,Squidward,138," Here! Enjoy!
",7
16721,Frankie Billy,138," Ugh!
",7
16722,Frankie Billy,138," Oh, come on! All that waiting for this?!
",7
16723,Squidward,138," Oh, puh-leeze. You wouldn't know quality if it hit you in the face!
",7
16724,Squidward,138," Doh! I said if it hit YOU in the face!
",7
16725,Frankie Billy,138," Whoa! That was worth the wait! I'll take two more!
",7
16726,Frank,138," I'll take five!
",7
16727,Nat,138," I wanna throw something at him!
",7
16728,SpongeBob,138," Wait! Gentle patrons, Krabby Patties are meant to be eaten, not flung. Think of all the joy these greasy, juicy patties and their attendant condiments have given you.
",7
16729,Harold,138," Gosh, he's right.
",7
16730,Frank,138," We shouldn't be so disrespectful of our favorite meal.

16731,SpongeBob,138," Bless you all.

16732,Patrick,138," I like throwing food.

16734,Mr. Krabs,138," And for you?

16735,Frank,138," I'll take twenty.

16736,Nathaniel,138," Do you have anything heavier?

16750,Plankton,139," You once told me that this was your favorite flavor growing up as a child.

16751,Grandma Plankton,139," Ration?
",7
16752,Plankton,139," Uh, no, chocolate. Open up! (feeds the pudding to Grandma) You can let go of the spoon now, Grandma. There. Oops, looks like you've got a little on your face. Here, let me. (wipes off the pudding) There you are. There you are, darling.

16759,Plankton,139," Ooh. Uh, uh, now, now, Grandma, just relax. There, there. (Grandma is asleep) That's perfect! (puts the teeth in his mouth) PERFECT! (laughs evilly) Why didn't I think of this before? No one can say ""No"" to a helpless little grandma! (thinking. He is at the Krusty Krab. 'female voice) Excuse me, Sonny, I'd simply love one of your Krabby what's-it's, but my delicate digestive system has special needs, and I'll need to see a complete list of ingredients. You wouldn't want me to be up all night with painful bloating, would you?

16760,Mr. Krabs,139," Goodness, no! (gives the formula to ""her"") Here you are.

16761,Plankton,139," Thanks, Sonny! I'm just going to take it home; I left my bifocals there. (laughs evilly as imagery fades) '(Bubble transition)

",7
16763,SpongeBob,139," Ehh, not really...

16764,Plankton,139," It's me, your dear old great-grammyma!

",7
16766,Plankton,139," I want to know all about your life—your job, where the secret formula is... (stammers) I mean...
",7
16767,SpongeBob,139," I'm so glad you came back... (rubs his finger across Plankton's chin) ...Double-Great Grammyma. (Plankton pushes it away and shudders) You're cold. Let's wrap you up in something nice and cozy. (Bubble transitions over to Plankton wrapped up in a blanket on a couch) Okay, lean forward. (Plankton grumbles as he does so. SpongeBob puts a pillow behind his back) There we go, now lean back, Grammyma. It's the coziest pillow I have. (Plankton does so but sinks into the pillow. He is yelling from it. SpongeBob reacts) How about we look through some old family photo albums? (SpongeBob runs to get them but Plankton is still stuck in the pillow. Cuts to SpongeBob laughing) Here's a picture of me when I developed my first appendage. (a picture of flattened SpongeBob tied to a balloon) Pretty neat photo album, eh, Double-G Grammyma? 
",7
16768,Plankton,139," It was certainly interesting, but I'd like to hear about your more recent affairs, like where you work, for instance.
",7
16769,SpongeBob,139," Ha, ha, ha, ha, don't worry. I've got pictures of that too... (shows stacks of photo albums) ...but we have a couple more from my early childhood to get through first.

16770,Plankton,139," Never let it be said that I didn't suffer for my occupation. (it is night which turns to morning. SpongeBob and Plankton are asleep. Spongebob wakes up and exclaims. He looks happily at Plankton)

16773,SpongeBob,139," Good mooorning. I'll go and fix us a nice breakfast, and then we'll spend the whole day together!
",7
16774,Plankton,139," Uh, sounds delightful. (takes off glasses. evilly laughs) Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh. (puts on more lipstick. Bubble transitions over to SpongeBob and Plankton walking down the street)
",7
16775,SpongeBob,139," So, Grammyma, what kinds of things do you active seniors like to do?
",7
16776,Plankton,139," Actually, SpongeBob, I said I wanted to see your life, remember?
",7
16777,SpongeBob,139," Hmmmm... (flashback of Plankton)

16778,Plankton,139," I want to know all about your life—your job, where the secret formula is... (stammers) I mean...
",7
16779,SpongeBob,139," (goes back to the present) No, you couldn't possibly care about any of that stuff. Your life must be way more full and exciting.
",7
16780,Plankton,139," Well, uh...
",7
16781,SpongeBob,139," (grabs Plankton by the arm and carries him) Come on, it'll be fun! (Bubble transitions over to the place called ""Grandma's Tea House."" SpongeBob drinks tea) Ahhh. Isn't this tea delicious, Grandma?
",7
16782,Plankton,139," Why, yes! (drinks the tea then spits it out on a coaster) HOW CAN YOU DRINK THIS DRECK?! (all of the grandmas gasp) Heh, heh, heh, heh... What I meant to say was, ""More, please."" (bubble transitions to other grandmas and SpongeBob knitting) 
",7
16783,SpongeBob,139," Knitting circles sure are fun, eh, Grammyma?
",7
16784,Plankton,139," Nope. (he has his arms in a yarn circle)
",7
16785,SpongeBob,139," Why are you not having fun?
",7
16786,Plankton,139," Why?! BECAUSE I DON'T KNIT, YOU NITWIT! (his yarn circle gets pulled and so does he by a grandma) 
",7
16787,SpongeBob,139," Are you sure? 'Cause you make a real nice scarf. (Plankton is knitted into a scarf. Bubble transitions over to Plankton and SpongeBob playing Canasta. Plankton puts down a Joker card with his cards the A of clubs, the two of spades, and the five of diamonds) Oh, Great-Grammyma, you win again. All hail the great Canasta ""masta""! (Plankton takes his Joker card and rips it in half and throws it on the table) Grandma, you getting bored?
",7
16788,Plankton,139," No, I'm getting hungry. I can feel my own stomach acids eating away at my organs. I COULD EAT A VILLAGE!
",7
16789,SpongeBob,139," Would you settle for a Krabby Patty?
",7
16790,Plankton,139," (reacts) Would I? (laughs. Then laughs maniacally. He clears his throat) Uh, yeah, I would. (bubble transitions over to SpongeBob and Plankton walking to the front entrance of the Krusty Krab) Uh, SpongeBob, would you mind terribly if we used the rear entrance? I'm a little shy around new people.
",7
16791,SpongeBob,139," Hmm... Hey, Grammy, do antenna run in our family?
",7
16792,Plankton,139," Antenna... What?! No, I...!
",7
16793,SpongeBob,139," (laughs) Oh-ho-ho-ho! Ah, she really is shy. Nobody ever uses this door except for me and... (Squidward bursts open the front door holding a garbage bag) ...Squidward!
",7
16794,Plankton,139," AAAH!
",7
16795,Squidward,139," SpongeBob, you have been warned about lurking back here on your days off!
",7
16796,SpongeBob,139," I'm just bringing in my great-grammyma for some lunch.
",7
16797,Squidward,139," Your what?
",7
16798,SpongeBob,139," My great-grammyma! (points to Plankton but he's not there) She must be hiding. Well, she did say she was shy.
",7
16799,Squidward,139," Right... (starts dumping the garbage in the trash can) SpongeBob, I promise not to tell Mr. Krabs about this if you promise that I don't have to see you again for the rest of the day. (Plankton is hiding in the trash can. He gets a lot of garbage all over him. He starts coughing. SpongeBob walks over to the trash can)
",7
16800,SpongeBob,139," Grammy, there you are. I was starting to worry.
",7
16801,Plankton,139," Never mind. Just get me into the kitchen! 
",7
16802,SpongeBob,139," (cuts to him and Plankton walking in the kitchen) Well, here it is.
",7
16803,Plankton,139," AT LAST!
",7
16804,SpongeBob,139," Grandma, I'm just gonna go make sure the restrooms are stocked. You, know, real quick—it's part of my day-off duties.
",7
16805,Plankton,139," Okay. I'll be standing right here when you get back, and not off somewhere snooping around for the secret formula or anything.
",7
16806,SpongeBob,139," Ha, ha, ha... What?
",7
16807,Plankton,139," Nothing, go ahead! (laughs menacingly. He pulls out a green balloon which is a decoy of him dressed as Grandma. He stretches it then blows it up) Let's see how this decoy floats your boat. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! (the balloon floats away and goes above Plankton who is checking under the dirty plates for the formula. The balloon lands in the drain of the sink)
",7
16808,SpongeBob,139," Okay, Grammyma, that's taken care of. I... (calls) Grammyma! She must've made her own way up to the cash register all by herself! Maybe I'll catch up on my dishwashing while I have the chance. (walks to the sink) The Krusty Krab manual says it is always a good idea to start by turning the garbage disposal on, just in case there is any leftover rubbish in the sink. (turns the garbage disposal on. The balloon starts ripping into a million pieces) Sounds like there's something stuck in the si- Grandma! (the balloon finishes ripping. Plankton looks up) Oh, I can't bear to look! (starts crying. Plankton thinks for a bit) Oh, Double-Great-Grammy-Grams, you were so soft and fragile like a... like a... like a... like a balloon!!
",7
16809,Plankton,139," SpongeBob, SpongeBob, up here!
",7
16810,SpongeBob,139," Grandma, is that you? Are you all right?
",7
16811,Plankton,139," Oh! I'm all right, but I've been ground to a pulp. If only there was a nice, cool, safe place nearby, like a safe nearby, where I could rest and recover.
",7
16812,SpongeBob,139," Well, there is the safe where Mr. Krabs keeps the Krusty Krab secret formula that Plankton's been trying to steal for the past bunch of years, but I don't think he'd mind if my dear old grammyma rests in there.
",7
16813,Plankton,139," Why would he?
",7
16814,SpongeBob,139," (carries Plankton over to the safe. He opens the safe which is filled with coins and cash. He puts Plankton on top of a stack of cash) Here you go. I'll come back for you a little later.
",7
16815,Plankton,139," Oh, I feel better already. (begins snoring)
",7
16816,SpongeBob,139," Sweet dreams, Grammyma. (closes the safe. Plankton starts laughing menacingly. He gets up)
",7
16817,Plankton,139," Sweet dreams, indeed, fool. Only this dream is about to become a nightmare, for Mr. Krabs! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha...! (Grandma Plankton's teeth fall out) I'm just going to savour this moment, because for once in my life—for once in my life—I feel TRULY ALIVE! (Grandma Plankton grabs her teeth)
",7
16818,Grandma Plankton,139," PLANKTON! (Plankton gasps. Grandma Plankton takes her glasses off his face) You've been a very naughty BOY, Plankton!
",7
16819,Plankton,139," B-But-But-But I... (Grandma Plankton takes her wig off his head) Grandma, I can... (Grandma Plankton takes her dress off Plankton's body)
",7
16820,Grandma Plankton,139," I've been looking all over for this stuff!
",7
16821,Plankton,139," Grandma, I can explain!
",7
16822,Grandma Plankton,139," (grabs Plankton by his right antenna and drags him out of the kitchen) I'm sure you can. Plankton Jr., you know you always were a... (stops at one of SpongeBob's feet)
",7
16823,SpongeBob,139," Grandma? (gasps) You caught Plankton! Let me guess—trying to steal the secret formula, right?
",7
16824,Grandma Plankton,139," Get out of my way, rapscallion! (SpongeBob does so) I've had enough foolishness for one day. (Plankton groans. Grandma Plankton drags him out of the Krusty Krab. The episode ends)",7

",7
16885,Cop #2,140," We shall have to chase him on foot. (monster growls as he runs away) It's headed straight for town. (they chase him into town and then stop) There, by the magazine stand.

",7
16886,Patrick,140," Wait just one minute. This is my friend. If you want to get to him, you're gonna have to go through me.

",7
16890,Patrick,140," (scoffs) Of course. He's a giant freak of nature, not a freak of nature that can't speak. (both whisper indistinctly) And so as the lowly snail sheddeth his shell, and the lofty gull moldeth his feathers, the brightest of friendships must dimmeth as the setting sun.

16910,Squidward,141," Hey!! Closed means closed, Grandma! [Squidward closes the door and the fish is pulled back, the fish slides into the Krusty Krab. sighs] Oh boy, Some people... [walks to the cash register]

16911,Madame Hagfish,141," [goes to order] One Krabby Patty please.
",7
16912,Squidward,141," I told you...we're closed! I was supposed to get out of here ten minutes ago! And besides, I already cashed the register out.

16913,Madame Hagfish,141," Ohh, but I-

16919,Madame Hagfish,141," Please I-

16920,Squidward,141," Never...
",7
16921,Madame Hagfish,141," I brought exact change... [Holds out three small shells]
",7
16922,Squidward,141," [Eyes twirking] Ah-ha, that is what they cost...20 years ago. Krabby Patties cost $4.50, lady.
",7
16923,Madame Hagfish,141," Oh dear. Seems I'm just one short.
",7
16924,Mr. Krabs,141," [looks at her] No way granny!
",7
16925,Madame Hagfish,141," Oh, But it's all I have. Please...

16926,Squidward,141," Nope.

16928,SpongeBob,141," [crying] How sad.

16931,Madame Hagfish,141," [gasps. slithers to the door] You haven't seen the last of me!!!! [leaves]
",7
16932,Mr. Krabs,141," Well, I've certainly seen enough [laughs].
",7
16933,Squidward,141," What a creepy old hagfish, I thought she'd never leave.
",7
16934,Mr. Krabs,141," Aye, good job there, SpongeBob. Say, what did you tell here that finally drove her out? I may need to know in case she ever comes back [laughs].
",7
16935,SpongeBob,141," [begins laughing along] Need to know in case she ever- [laughs again].
",7
16936,SpongeBob,141," [leaving] Have a good night Mr. Krabs.
",7
16937,Mr. Krabs,141," Oh, you too SpongeBob. Have a good- [notices something in SpongeBob's pants] Night...
",7
16938,SpongeBob,141," [sneaks behind the Krusty Krab] Old lady? Old lady?
",7
16939,Madame Hagfish,141," Here I am. [coughs] Right where you told me to meet you.
",7
16940,SpongeBob,141," Actually I told you to meet me two paces to the left.
",7
16941,SpongeBob,141," Oh good, you're here! [pulls two delicious Krabby Patties out of his pants] I brought the stuff.
",7
16942,Madame Hagfish,141," My goodness! This has to be the most kind, most generous, most thoughtful thing anyone has ever done for-
",7
16943,SpongeBob,141," You're welcome, just take them before someone sees us.
",7
16944,Mr. Krabs,141," Too late! [Mr. Krabs takes the patties]
",7
16945,SpongeBob,141," Mr. Krabs!
",7
16946,Mr. Krabs,141," So, it's true!
",7
16947,SpongeBob,141," H-How did you find out?
",7
16948,Mr. Krabs,141," Found out? Boy, you would have to get up pretty early to sneak a pair of buns past old, Mr. Krabs.
",7
16949,Squidward,141," Or before he takes off his sleep mask.
",7
16950,Mr. Krabs,141," How did you know I wear a sleep mask?
",7
16951,SpongeBob,141," Ohh please, Mr. Krabs don't fire me. Pleaaaseee! [thunder]
",7
16952,Madame Hagfish,141," [flies in the air] Eye of newt and frozen sharkskin slab, I hereby curse the Krusty Krab! [evil laugh. flies away. The clouds clear up]
",7
16953,Mr. Krabs,141," [throws patties away] We are not a soup kitchen, boy! And these will be coming out of your paycheck. Besides, we don't want to encourage- [shutters] charity...
",7
16954,SpongeBob,141," But what about the- the- the- the- the- the-
",7
16955,Mr. Krabs,141," Come on, boy! Spit it out!
",7
16956,SpongeBob,141," The- the- the- the- the-
",7
16957,Mr. Krabs,141," Okay, let's see what's under the hood. [Mr. Krabs reveals a record player in SpongeBob's chest. He moves the pin. laughs] I think that should do it.
",7
16958,SpongeBob,141," What about the curse?
",7
16959,SpongeBob,141," They are, Mr. Krabs?
",7
16960,Mr. Krabs,141," Yep. Just fabricated superstition. Right Squidward?
",7
16961,Squidward,141," You're asking the wrong guy about curses, I live next to SpongeBob [shutters]
",7
16962,Mr. Krabs,141," [laughs] See, boy, just a bonical ramblings of an old lady. Nothing to worry about.
",7
16963,Mr. Krabs,141," Squidward, I'm starting to get worried. I've got a funny feeling that the Krusty Krab really is cursed.
",7
16964,Squidward,141," And why is that?
",7
16965,Mr. Krabs,141," Well, we haven't seen a single customer all morning!
",7
16966,Squidward,141," That's not a curse. [sips coffee] That's a blessing.
",7
16967,Mr. Krabs,141," [laughs] Yeah, you're right, there is no such thing as curses. Ha.
",7
16968,Mr. Krabs,141," ME MONEYYY!!!! AAAHHHHHH!!!!
",7
16969,SpongeBob,141," I got it! I got it! [grabs a dollar bill and begins blowing on it] Ohh, Ohh Hot, hot! [he realizes that it is hot and slowly rips it into pieces] I don't got it...
",7
16970,Squidward,141," I just remember there is a no-curse clause in my contract, nice working with you.
",7
16971,Mr. Krabs,141," Squidward, wait. You don't even have a contract.
",7
16972,Squidward,141," There is a no-contract clause in it too.
",7
16973,SpongeBob,141," Mr. Krabs, what makes you so sure that even if we find that old lady, that she will lift the curse?
",7
16974,Mr. Krabs,141," [laughs] Don't worry, SpongeBob. Mr. Krabs has a special technique when dealing with situations like these. It's called beggin' and pleadin'
",7
16975,Narrator,141," Many Hours Later...
",7
16976,Mr. Krabs,141," Well, SpongeBob. I don't think were ever gonna find-
",7
16977,SpongeBob,141," Mr. Krabs, look!
",7
16978,Mr. Krabs,141," Well I'll be the slimy, son of a slithery, slippery sea slug, boy. It's here!
",7
16979,Madame Hagfish,141," Give me one good reason why I should lift the curse.
",7
16980,Mr. Krabs,141," Because if ya' don't, me business will be ruined forever.
",7
16981,Mr. Krabs,141," [crying and on his knees begging] Oh please, Madame Hagfish. Please, I'll do anything, anything at all.
",7
16982,Madame Hagfish,141," Oh, I like a man who begs.
",7
16983,Mr. Krabs,141," [whispering to SpongeBob] See, told ya'
",7
16984,Madame Hagfish,141," I will lift the curse, provided you two complete a dangerous task.
",7
16985,Mr. Krabs,141," Oh, wait a minute, granny, what part of this-
",7
16986,SpongeBob,141," Oh anything, Great Hagfish.
",7
16987,Madame Hagfish,141," Bring me the sacred gold doubloon from the throat of the Giant Golden Eel!
",7
16988,SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs,141," Okay...
",7
16989,SpongeBob,141," Well, this must be it. The lair of the Golden Eel.
",7
16990,Mr. Krabs,141," How could you tell?
",7
16991,SpongeBob,141," She gave me its business card.
",7
16992,Mr. Krabs,141," Hey, SpongeBob so you think this fudgy stuff we're walking in is the eel's-
",7
16993,SpongeBob,141," ...Leftover pudding. Yes I thought that too.
",7
16994,Mr. Krabs,141," Hold it, SpongeBob, Look. [points to the Golden Eel, who is sleeping]
",7
16995,SpongeBob,141," It's the eel. Well, nappy time always comes after pudding. Let's go get the doubloon from his throat before he wakes up.
",7
16996,Mr. Krabs,141," Good idea, be careful not to-
",7
16997,SpongeBob,141," [trips and falls] WOAAHHH!
",7
16998,Mr. Krabs,141," He's awake!
",7
16999,SpongeBob,141," Look out for his- Tail! Quick find something to-
",7
17000,SpongeBob,141," ...Hide behind... [The eel whacks SpongeBob and he goes flying] WOAAAH!!!!
",7
17001,SpongeBob,141," [starting to get up] Morning, already. [gasps] I'm coming Mr. Krabs [runs to Mr. Krabs] Don't go anywhere!
",7
17002,Mr. Krabs,141," I really don't have a choice [The eel traps in on Mr. Krabs tighter]
",7
17003,SpongeBob,141," Take, this! [pokes the Eel with his fist very lightly. The eel drops Mr. Krabs]
",7
17004,Mr. Krabs,141," Good job ladee!
",7
17005,SpongeBob,141," We're not finished yet! [pokes the Eel again, the doubloon flies out of his mouth] I got it! I got it! I got it! I got it! [SpongeBob claps his hands together but is unsuccessful in catching it] I don't got it.
",7
17006,Mr. Krabs,141," Madame Hagfish, we've got the gold doubloon you asked for.
",7
17007,Madame Hagfish,141," Finally. [deposits the doubloon into her washing machine] Clean free.
",7
17008,Mr. Krabs,141," Ahh, now it's time to lift that curse, like you promised.
",7
17009,Madame Hagfish,141," [pulls out a 'closed' sign from the Krusty Krab lawn] There ya' go, the curse is lifted.
",7
17010,SpongeBob,141," A closed sign?
",7
17011,Mr. Krabs,141," That's it? That's the curse?!
",7
17012,Madame Hagfish,141," You think I'm gonna waste good spells on a bottom-feeder like you? Have a nice day.
",7
17013,Mr. Krabs,141,"  Well, it's like I told you before boy, there ain't no such thing as witches, or curses, or magical beings, or-

17027,Mr. Krabs,143," [While walking over to SpongeBob and SpongeBob still pointing and babbling] SpongeBob? [Mr. Krabs stops walking. He grabs an oxygen tank and puts it over SpongeBob's mouth. SpongeBob stops babbling and starts taking deep breaths.] There, there, kid. What's the big deal?
",7
17028,SpongeBob,143," M-M-M-M-Mr. Krabs! [The scene cuts to the empty box.] We're all out of Krabby Patties, sir.
",7
17029,Mr. Krabs,143," That's nothing to fuss over, boy. We'll just whip up a new batch, like we did in the old days.
",7
17030,Mr. Krabs,143," I know this process like the back of me claw. [He grabs behind him for something.] We always start with... [He holds up an opened bag of flour.] ...flour. [He pours in the flour.] Next, we add [He lifts up some barnacle shavings.] barnacle shavings. It's like riding a boat-cycle, ain't it, boy?

17036,SpongeBob,143," That's funny, I remember turmeric third. And doesn't the recipe call for land salt?

17041,Mr. Krabs,143," Aren't you getting a little tired of this, Plankton?

17042,Plankton,143," Come on, Krabs, don't you have any respect for tradition?

17043,Mr. Krabs,143," Oh, ho, ho, ho, Of course, I do. That's why I'm doing this.

We now go to Perch Perkins live on the scene.

17049,Perch Perkins,143," Thanks, Elaine. Just moments ago, Eugene Krabs sent his famously delicious secret Krabby Patty formula packing.

17052,Perch Perkins,143," [While struggling to get the microphone out of SpongeBob's hands.] We wanted to ask Mr. Eugene Krabs [He manages to get the microphone free.] what compelled him to take such drastic measures.
",7
17053,Mr. Krabs,143," Well, it's simple, Perch. [The scene cuts to a TV screen with Mr. Krabs on it.] It seems keeping me secret formula in hand has proven to be all too temptin' for a [He turns towards the camera.] certain diminutive one-eyed criminal element of society.

17054,Mr. Krabs,143," All right, boy, let's get back to making them patties.

17059,SpongeBob,143," And that formula is...

17060,Mr. Krabs,143," On the opposite side of the ocean, yeah. [He groans. He walks to the wall, which has the door.] And now I've gotta go [While hitting his head on the wall] all [not hitting his head] the way [While hitting his head] there [not hitting his head] to [While hitting his head] get it.
",7
17061,SpongeBob,143," Mr. Krabs, I'll do it. Send me to retrieve that formula.
",7
17062,Mr. Krabs,143," Think you're up for the challenge?
",7
17063,SpongeBob,143," Uh-huh.
",7
17064,Mr. Krabs,143," Well, all right then, [He grabs SpongeBob by the side.] the formula is now stowed in a safe-deposit box in the ocean's largest, safest bank [He grabs a key.] in Way-far-out-town-ville.
",7
17065,SpongeBob,143," Ah, and that's the key to the box, eh, Mr. Krabs?

17066,Mr. Krabs,143," This, No. This is the key to me heart? [He pulls down his shirt, revealing a locked door on his chest. He then uses the key on it and opens the door. It shows his heart. Mr. Krabs puts his hand into his chest and takes out another key.] This is the safe-deposit box key.

17067,SpongeBob,143," [While grabbing for the key] Oh, thank you Mr.--
",7
17068,Mr. Krabs,143," [While pulling it away] Not so fast, kid. I want you to protect this at all costs. You mustn't let it out of your sight. I now bestow unto you the key to the future of The Krusty Krab.

17069,SpongeBob,143," I humbly accept this key and vow to guard it with my very life. (takes the key) It shan't leaveth my sight.

17074,Oran J. Roughy,143," I can take your luggage for you, sir. (grabs Patrick) Please follow me.

17075,SpongeBob,143," Wow, a real-life butler.

17076,Oran J. Roughy,143," I am not a butler.

17081,Oran J. Roughy,143," Your sleeping quarters. (tosses Patrick in there) I trust everything is to your liking.

17082,SpongeBob,143," Couldn't be better, butler.
",7
17083,Oran J. Roughy,143," Ahem. Perhaps Monsieur did not hear me. I trust everything is to your liking.
",7
17084,SpongeBob,143," Oh, oh yes, of course! How silly of me.
",7
17085,Oran J. Roughy,143," An honest mistake, monsieur.
",7
17086,SpongeBob,143," Thank you, my good man. (hands the butler a used, plastic burrito wrapper) I've been hunting for a trash can for at least ten minutes. Thanks again, French guy.
",7
17087,Patrick,143," Peek-a-boo!
",7
17088,SpongeBob,143," Hey Patrick, remember, we're on an important mission here. So keep your eyes open for any suspicious characters.
",7
17089,Patrick,143," (Patrick's reflection in the mirror gets an angry face while the real Patrick asks SpongeBob a question) SpongeBob, does that guy look suspicious to you? (looks back at the reflection) I think he might be spying on us. (Patrick's reflection goes away) Hey, where'd he go!? All this suspicious thing is making me hungry.
",7
17090,SpongeBob,143," Well, then follow me to the dining car.

17091,Plankton,143," (climbs on top of a bus) Looks like it's starting to roll my way for a change. And nothing dares stand in my way! (Plankton jumps) Uh-oh. (crashes into an 18-wheeler. Windshield wipers scrape Plankton off and he floats on down to the train) I knew I'd make it ? (cut to the dining car)
",7
17092,SpongeBob,143," Ooh Fancy.
",7
17093,Patrick ,143," Yeah. And they gave you so much food, you need 2 forks. (baby heard crying)
",7
17094,SpongeBob,143," Aw, what a cute little baby. No need to fuss, little fella.
",7
17095,Nanny,143," I just can't get him to stop crying. The poor dear.
",7
17096,SpongeBob,143," (sits down) Hi again, kind butler.
",7
17097,Employee,143," (sighs) So sorry monsieur. The dining car is closed now.

17098,SpongeBob,143," (looks at watch) But we haven't even heard the specials yet.
",7
17099,Employee,143," No, the dining car is over for you. You must leave now. (pushes SpongeBob away. He trips over a purse. A lady picks him up)
",7
17100,SpongeBob,143," Oh, sorry, ma'am.
",7
17101,Miss McGuffin,143," That's quite alright, handsome. (cut to a train terrace)
",7
17102,SpongeBob,143," Huh, friendly lady. Well, Patrick, we'd better find a safe place to store this for the night. (SpongeBob is holding the key but it's not there)
",7
17103,Patrick,143," What is that?
",7
17104,SpongeBob,143," That my dear Patrick is—the key! (sees it missing) Patrick, where is the key? Oh, no, I took a solemn oath. (Plankton is walking by angrily)
",7
17105,SpongeBob,143," Plankton! You stole the safety-deposit key.
",7
17106,Plankton,143," Oh, come on, I just got here. I couldn't have stolen it—yet.
",7
17107,SpongeBob,143," Oh yeah? Well no offense, but I don't believe you.

17108,Plankton,143," You calling me a liar?

17111,Plankton,143," Oh, drat.

17112,Patrick,143," (picks up bowl) Just after I scrub this bowl. (scrubs bowl) Alright, Plankton, time to squeeze the key out of you. (takes out some clamps. Plankton gasps) After my tasty snack. (uses the clamp to crush the nut. Plankton runs and screams) He's clean. (drops Plankton)

17113,Plankton,143," (grunts) I told you I wasn't lying.

17114,SpongeBob,143," Well, if you didn't steal it, then who did? It must've been someone on this train. Patrick, call the cops.
",7
17115,Patrick,143," (puts his head out the window) Cops, I need you! (cut to the Krusty Krab)
",7
17116,Crowd,143," (chanting) We want Krabby Patties! We want Krabby Patties! We want Krabby Patties! We want Krabby Patties! We want Krabby Patties!
",7
17117,Customer,143," Just give me a patty, man.
",7
17118,Squidward,143," For the last time, we're out of patties. (customers shout) No need to get excited now.
",7
17119,Customer,143," We want our patties, man. (destroys the cash register)
",7
17120,Squidward,143," That's Krusty Krab property. (another customer rips off a pole) That's a load-bearing column. (customer swings the pole at Squidward. He ducks) Hurry, SpongeBob. (cut to train being stopped and all riders are outside the train)
",7
17121,Plankton,143," Oh brother.
",7
17122,SpongeBob,143," Mr. Police Commissioner?
",7
17123,Commissioner,143," Yes, Mr. SquarePants?
",7
17124,SpongeBob,143," I sub-- (turns around and walks into the policeman) I submit to you that the perpetrator of this heinous theft is none other than...the nanny.
",7
17125,Nanny,143," (nervous chuckling) I haven't stolen a thing.
",7
17126,SpongeBob,143," Sir, if you search this baby's diaper, you'll find the stolen key.
",7
17127,Commissioner,143," Yes, Mr. SquarePants. (uses tongs to dig into the diaper. A metal sound clinks) Aha!
",7
17128,SpongeBob,143," The key!
",7
17129,Commissioner,143," (uses tongs to take out a huge diamond) At least I found it. Thank you, Mr. SquarePants. You uncovered Neptune's jewel of the sea and nabbed the infamous Jewel Triplets Gang.
",7
17130,SpongeBob,143," Triplets?
",7
17131,Baby Triplet,143," (deep voice) I told you taking the train was a mistake.
",7
17132,Triplet #2,143," (reveals himself being the legs of the nanny) Well, we wouldn't be on the lam if you hadn't applied for that discount card.
",7
17133,Baby Triplet,143," Well, can I help it if I'm frugal?
",7
17134,Commissioner,143," Tell it to your cellmate, junior. (handcuffs the baby)
",7
17135,SpongeBob,143," If they didn't do it...that means the key was stolen by...the butler.
",7
17136,Oran J. Roughy,143," (sighs) I certainly did not.
",7
17137,SpongeBob,143," We know you did it. The butler always commits the crime.
",7
17138,Oran J. Roughy,143," For the last time, I am not a butler. I don't even have the butler accent.
",7
17139,Patrick,143," You may not be a butler, but are you a werewolf? (there is a full moon. A fish walks up and grows hair and changes into a werewolf. He howls and runs off)
",7
17140,Plankton,143," Okay, butler, you may have hoodwinked the sponge, but I ain't no pushover! (gets hit with a piece of popcorn from Patrick)
",7
17141,Patrick,143," Sorry. (chomps on his popcorn)
",7
17142,Plankton,143," Anyway, since you didn't steal the key, then you'd obviously submit to a search of your cabin.
",7
17143,Oran J. Roughy,143," I do not have a cabin. I sleep on the luggage.
",7
17144,Plankton,143," Aha, that's how you stole it! Give it to me. Give me the key.
",7
17145,SpongeBob,143," Need I remind you, Plankton, that you are still a suspect yourself.
",7
17146,Plankton,143," Uh, I-I mean, give SpongeBob back the key.
",7
17147,SpongeBob,143," I don't believe either of you. Shake 'em down. (a big muscular police officer comes and turns the butler upside-down and shakes him. Plankton falls on the ground and gets hit with a nail clipper, a hammer, and an anvil from the butler's pockets)
",7
17148,Keystone Cop,143," Nothing suspicious here. (the butler's mask falls off) Except for the fact that you just outed Oran J. Roughy, international fugitive wanted for the embezzlement of over 75,000 bucks worth of ham sandwiches. (Patrick screams)
",7
17149,SpongeBob,143," After all this, I still haven't found the key and I broke my vow to Mr. Krabs. (sobs) I don't deserve to work at the Krusty Krab.
",7
17150,Patrick,143," (picking his teeth with the key) Don't worry, buddy. I'm sure it'll turn up.
",7
17151,SpongeBob,143," The key! Patrick! Where in the ocean's depth did you find it?
",7
17152,Patrick,143," I found it when I was cleaning your shorts from your little ""accident"" earlier.
",7
17153,SpongeBob,143," Well, that is great news.
",7
17154,Patrick,143," (yawns) Anyways, I'm gonna hit the sack. I'm pooped. I'm sure you can relate.
",7
17155,SpongeBob,143," Uh, yeah, me, too. (runs up into the train)
",7
17156,Plankton,143," (hiding behind the door hinges) Me, three. (laughs. Cut to the train moving. SpongeBob and Patrick are grunting as they try to get cozy in their very tight space of cabin)
",7
17157,Patrick,143," Say, would you mind scooching over? I can't even move my eyebrows.
",7
17158,SpongeBob,143," I'm trying. Sheesh, this isn't exactly a luxury suite.
",7
17159,Plankton,143," Here, maybe I can help. (opens window. SpongeBob and Patrick stick out their tongues like dogs)
",7
17160,SpongeBob,143," (sighs) Fresh water.
",7
17161,Patrick,143," What a cool view.
",7
17162,Plankton,143," Yeah, have a better look. (hits them both with a 2x4, sending them out of the train and down a sandy hill. Train whistles) And thanks for the key!
",7
17163,Patrick,143," Well, I guess he lost us. You ready to call it a day, SpongeBob? (SpongeBob runs off) Guess not. (runs after him)
",7
17164,SpongeBob,143," Okay, Patrick, on the count of three, we'll jump on, okay?
",7
17165,Patrick,143," Gotcha, pal. Oh, wait, I can't count that high. Can we just jump on the count of one?
",7
17166,SpongeBob,143," That'll work, too. Okay, on the count of one—what the? (they come to a cliff. The train is still riding off)
",7
17167,Patrick,143," Great, now what?
",7
17168,SpongeBob,143," Patrick, hop up on my back.
",7
17169,Patrick,143," Well, I don't think this is the right time for a piggyback ride.
",7
17170,SpongeBob,143," Just do it.
",7
17171,Patrick,143," Okay. But I don't see how this is gonna get us any closer to the tr-- (screams. SpongeBob jumped off the cliff) Are you crazy?! Please! I'm sorry for any grief I've caused you! Don't do it, please! (crying. SpongeBob flips onto Patrick's back and turns himself into a hang-glider) Hey, we're flying!
",7
17172,SpongeBob,143," There you go, buddy. (sets Patrick on top of the train. They both go into the train in search of Plankton) Oh, Plankton!
",7
17173,Patrick,143," You can't hide forever. (both yelp as a bunch of luggage falls on them)
",7
17174,Plankton,143," Looks like you've got a lot on your mind. (Plankton runs off. Spongebob and Patrick chase after him through many train doors of the caboose and the coaches and head through the coal tender and enter the engine's cabin)
",7
17175,SpongeBob,143," Alright, Plankton, end of the line! (sees the train controls, only to find that Plankton is not there) Plankton!
",7
17176,Plankton,143," Over here, choo-choo heads. (laughs as he closes the door and then separates the train by uncoupling the tender, coaches, and caboose from the engine)
",7
17177,Patrick,143," That was odd.
",7
17178,SpongeBob,143," Yeah, and Plankton still has the key. (sees the head of the train getting farther away from the rest of it) Patrick, we've got a big problem. Look.
",7
17179,Patrick,143," Hey, where'd all those—those shiny tubes?
",7
17180,SpongeBob,143," That's just it, Patrick, they aren't there.
",7
17181,Patrick,143," Hmm. In that case... (both he and SpongeBob scream. Back to the other train parts with the tender, coaches, and caboose)
",7
17182,Fish #1,143," Hey, what's going on?
",7
17183,Fish #2,143," I've got places to be.
",7
17184,Fish #3,143," Let's go already!
",7
17185,Plankton,143," (opens one of the train doors and we see Far-Out-Ville and the bank across the way) It's too easy. (back to the head of the train)
",7
17186,SpongeBob,143," Patrick, we have to stop this thing! Go see if you can do something with that stuff. I'll try and get the door open.
",7
17187,Patrick,143," What do I do? What do I do? (reads the brake signal) B-R-A-K-E. BRAKE. I can do that. Well, SpongeBob, I think our troubles are over. (shows the brake signal in his hand that he just broke)
",7
17188,SpongeBob,143," (peers back and screams in fear when he sees that Patrick has broken the brake signal off) You broke the brake?
",7
17189,Patrick,143," It told me to.
",7
17190,SpongeBob,143," What do we do now? (starts pushing the buttons and messing around with the controls) Oh, one of these thingama-hoozies has to stop the train. Patrick, try something!
",7
17191,Patrick,143," I'm on it. (picks up and uses a coal shovel to put some coal into the engine's firebox) Maybe shoveling in these black rocks will help. (The train engine overheats and runs out of control as if it might fall apart. At a train signal station, SpongeBob and Patrick signal for help over the radio)
",7
17192,SpongeBob & Patrick,143," We're on an out-of-control train! (man spits out his coffee)
",7
17193,Man,143," This is control station to engine five. Do you copy?
",7
17194,SpongeBob,143," Oh, uh, yes, sir. I copy. I'm SpongeBob and I'm on an out-of-control train.
",7
17195,Man,143," Kid, let me talk to the engineer.
",7
17196,SpongeBob,143," Um, who?
",7
17197,Man,143," The guy driving the train.
",7
17198,SpongeBob,143," Oh, uh, th-that would be me. And Patrick's here, too. Say hi to the nice gentleman, Patrick.
",7
17199,Patrick,143," Hi.
",7
17200,SpongeBob,143," Oh, the back of the train is gone!
",7
17201,Man,143," Oh, no. (looks at map) The train's headed straight for the rest home. (picture of Rest Home) And that means...
",7
17202,SpongeBob,143," Means what? Means what? What does that mean, mister?
",7
17203,Man,143," (snaps on helmet) It means that train's coming right through that-- (the train engine crashes through the train depot) Beware the twisted trestles, kid! (lets go of the train engine)
",7
17204,SpongeBob,143," What is that?
",7
17205,Man,143," (points) That's that. (the train engine does some loop-de-loops. SpongeBob and Patrick cheer and laugh)
",7
17206,SpongeBob & Patrick,143," (sigh) That was fun.
",7
17207,Patrick,143," Now, where were we? Oh, yeah. I'll save us! (runs faster than the engine and holds up a 'STOP' sign. The train keeps going. Patrick tries again but uses a lemonade stand) Ice-cold lemonade! Get your ice-cold, tasty, refreshing, and also ice-cold lemon... (groans. The train engine passes by) Hey! Everyone stops for free lemonade! (runs past the train again)
",7
17208,SpongeBob,143," 'Attaboy, Patrick. Don't give... (Patrick puts down a giant piece of coral rock. The overheating engine flips around and slides on the tracks)
",7
17209,Patrick,143," Hey. Hey, wait for me... (climbs into the engine's cabin) Hey, SpongeBob! (the train engine crashes through a tunnel)
",7
17210,SpongeBob,143," Whoa! Whoa! (the overheating train engine is getting near the Rest Home)
",7
17211,Rest Home Citizen,143," There's a train behind you.
",7
17212,Rest Home Citizen #2,143," How many times do you think I'm falling for that one?
",7
17213,Patrick,143," Hey, would you quit messing around? You're making me sick. (the train engine stops before hitting the Rest Home. One of the citizens peeks at the other ones cards)
",7
17214,Rest Home Citizen #2,143," Hey! (SpongeBob and Patrick sigh)
",7
17215,SpongeBob,143," Sorry, oldsters, we'd love to stay and help you clean up the mess, but we've got a formula to save. (the train engine starts again but back toward Far-Out-Ville)
",7
17216,Patrick,143," Hmm. (reads the throttle letters) T-H-R-O-T-T-L-E. Brake! I can do that. (breaks the throttle handle. Walks up to SpongeBob) You didn't need this, did you? (The engine starts to increase its speed and go faster and faster. Cut to the bank)
",7
17217,Plankton,143," Hee hee hee hee hee. Ha ha ha ha ha. (uses ladder to get up to the safe-deposit box) Come to papa! (opens box and gets formula) At last, my day of triumph has come! Again.
",7
17218,Mr. Krabs,143," Well, well. (turns on a light)
",7
17219,Plankton,143," What? B-b-but how?
",7
17220,Mr. Krabs,143," You honestly didn't think I would have left you out of this elaborate equation, did you?
",7
17221,Plankton,143,"I can explain, Eugene. I, uh, I was just keeping it warm for you. Yeah.
",7
17222,Mr. Krabs,143," (laughs) Sure. I believe ya. (grabs Plankton) Say, since you went through all the trouble of getting here, there you go, Plankton. (as he puts Plankton in his safe-deposit box, Plankton jumps out and gets the formula) Enjoy the scenery. Hey, where'd he go?
",7
17223,Plankton,143," Checkmate, Krabs! (laughs evilly. The runaway engine runs into the bank and squishes Plankton) Ow.
",7
17224,Mr. Krabs,143," Good job, boyo.
",7
17225,SpongeBob,143," I simply refused to fail, sir.
",7
17226,Bank Teller,143," (clears throat) That's all very wonderful, but do you mind telling me how you intend to pay for the damage to the bank?
",7
17227,Mr. Krabs,143," Uh... You know, I just remembered, I'm late for a very important meetin'. Take care of it, will ya boy?
",7
17228,Bank Teller,143," (grabs Mr. Krabs) Not so fast, Krabs. Looks like you have just enough in your bank account to cover the cost.
",7
17229,Mr. Krabs,143," No...!

17230,Narrator,143," 75 Years Later.

17231,SpongeBob,143," (now old and in a futuristic Bikini Bottom) And that was the story of the great train caper. Didn't you find it exciting?

17232,SpongeBob's Grandson,143," (playing a game) Shh. I just beat my high score. Oh, yeah!

",7
17388,Patrick,145," I'm just gonna hang here for a while, maybe get a kelp soda later.

17389,SpongeBob,145," Patrick, you can't go anywhere. We're trapped down here till they open that capsule in 50 years.

17400,Patrick,145," Hey, SpongeBob, what do you think Bikini Bottom will be like in the future?
",7
17401,SpongeBob,145," Hmmm. [SpongeBob imagines his future in a chrome area. He gets out of the time capsule]
",7
17402,Future Fish,145," Welcome to the future, history person. During your absence, our society has achieved numerous advances we're sure you'll find to be quite impressive. [he and SpongeBob get teleported to a water fountain] Well?

17403,SpongeBob,145," [gasps] Wow, a water fountain for short people! What will the future think of next? [SpongeBob's future ends]
",7
17404,Patrick,145," Not bad, SpongeBob. Not bad. I dream of a town with a perfect blend of commerce and irrigation. [imagines his future in a real city] Not to mention the breathtaking views. [Patrick's future ends]
",7
17405,SpongeBob,145," Sounds dreamy, Pat. What do you think the future will be like, Squidward?
",7
17406,Future Octopus,145," [holding up Squidward's painting of him] His art embodies the soul that our society has lost. And it is here, [the Krusty Krab is shown] the location of the suffering that inspired that art that we place the Squidward Tentacles Memorial Museum! [Squidward's house is dropped on top of the Krusty Krab replacing it with the museum; the other octopi cheer]

17408,Plankton,145," [uses his mining drill and burrows towards the time capsule] Jackpot! And now to extract the secret recipe. [the mining drill extends its arms, holding and wedge and hammer] Careful. Careful. [the hammer hits the wedge and Squidward gets knocked out]
",7
17409,SpongeBob & Patrick,145," Sixteen Bikini Bottom, nineteen Bikini Bottom, twenty! Ready or not, here we... [they both spot Squidward]
",7
17410,Patrick,145," Nice try, Squidward, but we both already got that hiding spot figured out. [finds a can of shaving gel] Whipped cream! [eats cream and spits it out] Oh, this whipped cream tastes awful! [reads off can] ""Sha-veeng g-el.""[a drill drills through and creates a hole in the can causing the shaving gel to land on Patrick's face] I've always wanted a beard!
",7
17411,SpongeBob,145," Me too! [both laugh as SpongeBob sprays shaving gel on his face] Do you want one too, Squidbeard? [sprays a beard on Squidward's face]
",7
17412,Squidward,145," [wakes up and moans] Wha...? Oh! Has it been 50 years already? [looks in the mirror and notices the beard] Yes! I knew I'd still be hot!

17413,Plankton,145," [sneaks inside] Secret recipe, where are you? Aha! [jumps through the hole]
",7
17414,Squidward,145," Hello, future! [escapes through the hole Plankton made and digs up to the surface. He laughs] Yes! Huh? What the...?! Where's my museum? The future is the same as my old pathetic life! Forget this! I'm waiting another 50 years! [SpongeBob and Patrick watch as he stomps away]
",7
17415,Plankton,145," Finally, the Krabby Patty secret recipe! [laughs evilly]
",7
17416,Squidward,145," [stomps on Plankton, causing him to swallow the bottle] Dig me out when my life doesn't stink.

17520,Abrasive SpongeBob,146," No!

",7
17532,Sandy,146,"  I think it's high time we got rid of this critter. [Sandy puts the abrasive side in a package, puts a ""Return to Sender"" sticker on it, and stuffs it in a mailbox]

17533,SpongeBob,146," So long, Abrasivey! [Abrasive Side growls again] Grandma! I've got to apologize to Grandma! [Bubble transition to Grandma's] Grandma? Hello Grandma, I'm sorry about earlier. So, what do ya say? Can we discuss forgiveness over a cup of your famous hot cocoa?

17544,SpongeBob,148," With pleasure, Mr. Krabs. (puts on rubber gloves and gets the key from underneath his shoe. Puts the key into the stove ignition and turns it on to work like a car. Pushes on the pedal) I love this part of the job.
",7
17545,Mr. Krabs,148," Don't forget the cheese.

",7
17551,Mr. Krabs,148," What are you going on about? I let you turn the sign every day. (cut to SpongeBob walking up to the closed sign and puts a briefcase down. Opens it up to put on his 'ceremonial gloves' to turn the sign)
",7
17552,SpongeBob,148," As I don the ceremonial white gloves, I can continue the eternal cycle and now deem the Krusty Krab...open. (turns the sign from 'closed' to 'open') Patrons, spring forth. (SpongeBob holds the front door open) The Krusty Krab will now seat you. (no one is there)
",7
17553,Mr. Krabs,148," (storms to SpongeBob) All right, you landlubbers, get the lead-- (gasps) Neptune's jewels! Where are all me costumers? And just when the Krabby Patty was about to go triple platinum. Squidward. Squidward? Squidward!
",7
17554,SpongeBob,148," (looks behind the counter) No need to shout Mr. Krabs, he's right here, secretly watching his favorite soap, 'As The Tide Turns'.
",7
17555,Squidward,148," Shut it SpongeBob. Gil is about to reveal his secret.
",7

17557,Squidward,148," I knew it!

17559,Sea Chicken,148," (on TV) Cock-a-doodle-yum! (squawks) Rise and shine! We're the best restaurant in the sea!

17562,Announcer,148," (on TV) Say, Mr. Sea Chicken, how's the flavor of that zesty sea chicken sandwich?
",7
17563,Sea Chicken,148," (on TV) It's im-peck-able! (squawks) So come on down to my Sea Chicken Shack, and don't forget the kids. (four kids come up to him and hang on him)
",7
17564,Mr. Krabs,148," Blimey, this is the first I've heard of this Mr. Sea Chicken. There goes me monopoly. But how did he lure away me loyal customers away so fast? SpongeBob, I need you to head over to the Sea Chicken Shack and see what's cookin'.
",7
17565,SpongeBob,148," You want me to go undercover?
",7
17566,Mr. Krabs,148," Uh, that won't be necessary, boy. Just look around, see how he's roping in all these customers.
",7
17567,SpongeBob,148," Understood, Mr. Krabs. (raises his arm and takes a picture with his armpit) How do you like my new armpit spy cam, huh? Huh?
",7
17568,Mr. Krabs,148," SpongeBob, I don't need a spy.
",7
17569,SpongeBob,148," Oh, and check this out—a special spy pen! Looks just like a regular pen, right? See? See? See? See? See? See? Just a pen, right? See?
",7
17570,Mr. Krabs,148," Right.
",7
17571,SpongeBob,148," Well, you'd be mistaken sir because this pen is also...a pencil. Hmm? Pretty sweet undercover spy stuff, huh, Mr. Krabs?
",7
17572,Mr. Krabs,148," Boy, stop this nonsense!
",7
17573,SpongeBob,148," You're right, sir. Who needs a spy pen when you are a master in the undercover arts? I blend in with the common man. Then, like a whisper, I am gone. (cut to Sea Chicken Shack where SpongeBob is in disguise) Yellow Scrubber to Big Red. Come in, Big Red.
",7
17574,Mr. Krabs,148," Just tell me what you see, SpongeBob.
",7
17575,SpongeBob,148," I am inside. I repeat, I am inside. Nothing of interest to report so far. In fact, it's kind of dumpy. And customer safety... a little lax. (customer sits on a chair but it collapses) And it smells in here like a tuna bathed in algae after running a marathon.
",7
17576,Fish #23,148," (drenching in sweat after running a marathon) Oh, so it's a crime now to exercise.
",7
17577,Mr. Krabs,148," What about the food?
",7
17578,SpongeBob,148," I have infiltrated the line right now, and I'll report back once I obtained sample.
",7
17579,Cashier,148," Next.
",7
17580,SpongeBob,148," One of your finest sandwiches, please.
",7
17581,Cashier,148," I'm afraid I can't do that, sir. Please refer to our policy regarding dress.
",7
17582,SpongeBob,148," (reads policy) ""Headbands equal no service."" Barnacles! My disguises' only weakness-- (two employees grab SpongeBob and take him away) Whoa! Mayday, Big Red. Contact has not been established. Mission abort. Mission abort! (employees throw SpongeBob out) Yellow Scrubber to Big Red, I was not able to obtain any intel.
",7
17583,Mr. Krabs,148," Cut the spy lingo and just tell me, is there anything remarkable about the Sea Chicken Shack?
",7
17584,SpongeBob,148," Other than the faux dilapidation, not really.
",7
17585,Mr. Krabs,148," What you're describin' is an absolute dump. Are there any unique or interesting amenities that might attract me customers in any way?
",7
17586,SpongeBob,148," No. Great barrier reef!
",7
17587,Mr. Krabs,148," What is it, lad? What do you see?
",7
17588,SpongeBob,148," I see a huge statue depicting Mr. Sea Chicken and all his glory! (a bunch of kids are climbing on the giant statue)
",7
17589,Mr. Krabs,148," A statue? How does a statue steal me customers? (static on other end of radio) SpongeBob? SpongeBob? (he's taken his wristband radio off and is now climbing on the giant chicken statue) Of course, Mr. Sea Chicken, you mad trickster, you, cater to the kids and the parents will foll-er. (cut to later at Krusty Krab) Boys, we don't have much time, so I'm gonna make this short and sweet. I need an artist, someone with a vision...
",7
17590,Squidward,148," Oh, boy.
",7
17591,Mr. Krabs,148," Someone among us with a big talent...
",7
17592,Squidward,148," He's talking about me.
",7
17593,Mr. Krabs,148," Someone to create a glorious, towering statue of my likeness. You guys know anyone around here with an artistic bone in their body?
",7
17594,SpongeBob,148," (babbling) I do.
",7
17595,Mr. Krabs,148," Ooh, really? Who?
",7
17596,SpongeBob,148," Guess.
",7
17597,Mr. Krabs,148," Um, Larry The Lobster?

17602,SpongeBob,148," No.

17603,Mr. Krabs,148," My mom?
",7
17604,SpongeBob,148," No.
",7
17605,Mr. Krabs,148," Then who?
",7
17606,Squidward,148," For the love of all things briny, it's me!
",7
17607,SpongeBob,148," Correct.
",7
17608,Mr. Krabs,148," Oh, that's right, Squidward. You do dabble in the doodlin' doodly-doo.
",7
17609,Squidward,148," For those who care, I am nothing short of an artistic genius.
",7
17610,SpongeBob,148," Word.
",7
17611,Squidward,148," Unfortunately, that precludes me from doing any commercial pieces. Good-bye.
",7
17612,Mr. Krabs,148," Hey, hey, now hold on, Mr. Squidward. You and I aren't that different from each other. We both ""make product.""
",7
17613,Squidward,148," Are you suggesting the Krabby Patties are art?
",7
17614,Mr. Krabs,148," Yes. Squidward, do you have any idea how many people come to the Krusty Krab every day?
",7
17615,Squidward,148," Oh, I don't know, 12?
",7
17616,Mr. Krabs,148," Well, that's 12 more seeing your art than yesterday.
",7
17617,Squidward,148," (sighs) All right, Krabs, I'll do it. But I will need complete artistic control.
",7
17618,Mr. Krabs,148," You got it, long as it's done by opening tomorrow.
",7
17619,Squidward,148," Yes, tom—tomorrow!
",7
17620,Mr. Krabs,148," As advertised.
",7
17621,Squidward,148," I can't make a work for the ages overnight. Art does not march to a ticking clock. Art shall come when art is good and ready, sir.
",7
17622,Squidward,148," I'll need an assistant.
",7
17623,Mr. Krabs,148," Here you go. (SpongeBob is Squidward's assistant)
",7
17624,Squidward,148," Fine. The first thing I need you to do, assistant, is get me a giant stone so that I may sculpt this masterpiece.
",7
17625,SpongeBob,148," Anything for the artiste.
",7
17626,Squidward,148," And don't dilly... (SpongeBob pushes a giant stone into the Krusty Krab) ...dally. Nice rock.
",7
17627,SpongeBob,148," Isn't it? I can't believe no one was using it. (SpongeBob took the rock from a museum, which collapses from not having the rock)
",7
17628,Mr. Krabs,148," I'm gonna be rich.
",7
17629,Squidward,148," I'm gonna be famous.
",7
17630,SpongeBob,148," I'm gonna be Squidward's assistant giant rock fetcher. (cut to later where Mr. Krabs is posing for Squidward)
",7
17631,Squidward,148," Prepare to be immortalized in stone.
",7
17632,Mr. Krabs,148," Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! What do you think you're doing? I'm...shy.
",7
17633,Squidward,148," I am posing you! Did you think the sculpture was going to make itself? (shot of Mr. Krabs from behind) Don't you want the money this statue's going to bring in? (Mr. Krabs drops the towel)
",7
17634,Mr. Krabs,148," Like this?
",7
17635,Squidward,148," Nope.
",7
17636,Mr. Krabs,148," Or this? (poses with a bow and arrow)
",7
17637,Squidward,148," Nope.
",7
17638,Mr. Krabs,148," Or this? (poses with a golden discus)
",7
17639,Squidward,148," Nope.
",7
17640,Mr. Krabs,148," Or this? (poses as the thinker)
",7
17641,Squidward,148," Nope.
",7
17642,Mr. Krabs,148," Oh, come on, Squidward. (sniffs his armpits)
",7
17643,Squidward,148," Mm. (gets an idea) Hold that pose! Don't move a muscle. (chuckles)
",7
17644,Mr. Krabs,148," How long am I gonna have to stay like this?
",7
17645,Squidward,148," As long as it takes. (Squidward uses various tools for sculpting. SpongeBob poses for a bit but Squidward sends him away. Mr. Krabs grows tired of the post but SpongeBob helps him out by putting a spoon and fork under his arms to help them stay up. Cut to next morning where Squidward gets finished with the sculpture and sighs)
",7
17646,Mr. Krabs,148," Come on, Squidward, I'm about to give out!
",7
17647,Squidward,148," All done. (the spoon and fork break into pieces and Mr. Krab's left arm snaps)
",7
17648,Mr. Krabs,148," Okay, let's see it!
",7
17649,Squidward,148," Make sure you wear sunglasses, or you may be blinded by my genius.
",7
17650,Mr. Krabs,148," Yeah, yeah, just show me. (Squidward pulls back the curtain)
",7
17651,Squidward,148," Voila! (Mr. Krabs frowns after looking it then shatters into pieces)
",7
17652,Mr. Krabs,148," What's that supposed to be?
",7
17653,Squidward,148," This is a masterpiece.
",7
17654,Mr. Krabs,148," I don't have a mouth in my stomach.
",7
17655,Squidward,148," It represents the gaping, mashing maw of consumerism and the endless cavern it creates within us all. I call it Oppression.
",7
17656,Mr. Krabs,148," Whatever that means. But is it safe for kids to play on?
",7
17657,Squidward,148," This is art, not a swing set!
",7
17658,Mr. Krabs,148," Well, we should do a dry run before we let the general public use it. SpongeBob!
",7
17659,SpongeBob,148," Reporting for duty, sir!
",7
17660,Mr. Krabs,148," I'm gonna need you to frolic and play on this here doohickey thingy.
",7
17661,Squidward,148," It is not a doohickey, it's art!
",7
17662,SpongeBob,148," I read you loud and clear, captain. Loud and clear. (swings on the statue's nose and it falls on top of him) Wow, this is heavy.
",7
17663,Mr. Krabs,148," Squidward! I can't let kids play on that—that—that weapon. I'm gonna get my pants sued off.
",7
17664,Squidward,148," What, you wanted a piece or art and that's what you got.
",7
17665,Mr. Krabs,148," Oh it's a piece all right, a piece of junk!
",7
17666,SpongeBob,148," Mr. Krabs, if I may be allowed to float an idea.
",7
17667,Mr. Krabs,148," Did you hear something? (cut to Mr. Krabs being painted golden and having kids climb on him) Oh, how long do I have to stay like this?
",7
17668,Squidward,148," As long as you're wanting to sell this many patties. (Mr. Krabs groans)
",7
17669,SpongeBob,148," I think you look really good, sir. You're golden! (laughs)",7

17730,SpongeBob,149," [Frowns and puts down sign and Krabby Patty] No.
",7
17731,Patrick,149," I thought for sure I had that one.
",7
17732,SpongeBob,149," Okay, let's try an easy one. Is your best friend a boy or a girl?
",7
17733,Patrick,149," Ooh. That's a toughie. [Eyes SpongeBob's muscles] Hmm. Rugged biceps. [inspects SpongeBob's eyes] Yet, delicate eyelashes. Pass!

17741,Patrick,149," Ooh! It's right on the tip of my tongue!
",7
17742,SpongeBob,149," [Holds up a timer] Five seconds.
",7
17743,Patrick,149," [shouts] Um, um, oh, jeez, trapezoid, pentagon, mormorphis...

17745,Patrick,149," TRIANGLE!!

17746,Squidward,149," Idiots, wrecking my boat.
",7
17747,Squidward,149," So, who won your stupid quiz?
",7
17748,Patrick,149," It was a tie.
",7
17749,Squidward,149," [takes the Simple-Ton magazine] Let me see that. [Starts laughing] a triangle?! Patrick didn't know anything about you! [continues laughing] And he's supposed to be your best friend?
",7
17750,Patrick,149," I know, it's like we're not friends at all!
",7
17751,SpongeBob,149," Now, now. Patrick may not have passed the quiz, but like a true best friend, he's always here for me. Right Patrick? [turns to Patrick, but he's nowhere in sight] Patrick?
",7
17752,Patrick,149," Ice cream!
",7
17753,Squidward,149," Looks like your best friend isn't a friend at all! [laughs]
",7
17754,SpongeBob,149," [walks outside to Patrick]
",7
17755,Patrick,149," Hey, SpongeBob! I got you an ice cream. [holds out an ice cream cone to SpongeBob]
",7
17756,SpongeBob,149," [takes the cone] thank you best friend, Patrick.
",7
17757,Patrick,149," It's your favorite! Dill Pickle Swirl with mustard and extra bacon bits!
",7
17758,SpongeBob,149," Patrick, this is your favorite ice cream. My favorite is, plain vanilla.
",7
17759,Patrick,149," Oh, right. [takes the ice cream out of SpongeBob's hand] Well, more ice cream for me!
",7
17760,Patrick,149," Oh, can I borrow five bucks?
",7
17761,SpongeBob,149," Here! Take your dirty, rotten money! [throws the money onto the ground] Ahhah! I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU ANYMORE! [runs off, crying]
",7
17762,Ice Cream Man,149," Hey, what's with him?
",7
17763,Patrick,149," I guess he didn't want any ice cream.
",7
17764,Gary,149," Meow-row. [gets splashed by SpongeBob's tears as he sobs even harder. Gary slithers away crossly] Meow-row-row...
",7
17765,SpongeBob,149," It just isn't fair! [tries to calm himself down] Oh, who needs Patrick anyway? [leaves his house] Rest of my life, here I come! [walks by Patrick, who's sunning himself on his rock]
",7
17766,Patrick,149," Oh hey there, SpongeBob!
",7
17767,SpongeBob,149," [to himself] Be strong, be strong, be strong, be strong! Good afternoon, Mr. Star. [Walks off]
",7
17768,Patrick,149," See you later!
",7
17769,SpongeBob,149," Oh Sandy! It was awful! Truly awful! We were like complete strangers!
",7
17770,Sandy,149," You don't need to know everything about your best friend. That's what keeps the friendship interesting!
",7
17771,SpongeBob,149," Really?
",7
17772,Sandy,149," Maybe you and Patrick just need some time apart.
",7
17773,SpongeBob,149," [sniffles] Yeah! I'll have lots of fun without Patrick! [walks off to Sandy's door, and on his way out, he breaks down in tears again]
",7
17774,Sandy,149," [To herself] What a crybaby.
",7
17775,SpongeBob,149," I don't need Patrick! I can have a good time all by myself! [takes out jellyfishing net] I can go jellyfishing! [sobers up] Patrick and I used to go jellyfishing...I can play leapfrog! [jumps over a rock, then pulls it up on him and tries to toss it over his head, but winds up under it and tries to slide out from under it] I can blow bubbles! [blows a bubble, but it looks just like Patrick,] Uh, maybe not. [bubble pops, SpongeBob sighs.. Patrick comes by, singing nonsense]
",7
17776,SpongeBob,149," Oh, it's Patrick! I can led him see me! [Drills a hole in the sand and hides in it. Patrick skips over the hole. SpongeBob checks to make sure he's gone, then exits the hole] Well, he doesn't seem to be missing me at all. [Patrick walks off, still singing nonsense] Nice that he's gotten over our friendship so quickly! [SpongeBob then returns to the whole, and digs a tunnel that's following Patrick.. Patrick is seen entering the Gym while SpongeBob watches him from afar]
",7
17777,SpongeBob,149," Patrick works out at the gym? [Takes out binocular and watches Patrick exiting the Gym the Larry the Lobster] And he's hanging out with Larry the Lobster? Maybe I don't know much about Patrick, either.
",7
17778,SpongeBob,149," [watches Patrick from the inside of a blender] Patrick's shopping for cookery? Very suspicious. Oh! He's coming back! [Hides back in the blender. Patrick comes to the blender and presses a button, activating the blender. Patrick then leaves. SpongeBob hand comes out of the blender and turns it off. And SpongeBob, now liquefied, exits the blender.. Cuts to Larry and Patrick purchasing something from the magic shop. As the exit, one of the top hats from the top hat display follows them]
",7
17779,SpongeBob,149," [From inside the hat] Hold it right there, Patrick! [jumps out of the hat]
",7
17780,Larry the Lobster,149," Hi, SpongeBob.
",7
17781,Patrick,149," We were just coming to see you.
",7
17782,SpongeBob,149," [angrily] Oh, I'll bet you were, to tell me about your new best friend, Larry, I suppose?!
",7
17783,Larry,149," Whoa, settle down, little dude. I don't want to get in the middle of, whatever this is. [Walks off]
",7
17784,Patrick,149," While Larry is a great guy, loads of talent, and good looks.
",7
17785,SpongeBob,149," I know, he is pretty amazing...
",7
17786,Patrick,149," He's not my best friend. He was just helping me buy a present.
",7
17787,SpongeBob,149," [angrily] Who for? Sandy?
",7
17788,Patrick,149," No. For my REAL best friend, SpongeBob SquarePants. [holds out the bag he's holding]
",7
17789,SpongeBob,149," Really? [Takes the bag and opens it up] For me? What is it? [Takes out a rubber nose, mustache, and glasses disguise] Oh! I love it! You DO know me, best friend!
",7
17790,Patrick,149," [wearing the same disguise] I got a pair for me too! [laughs]
",7
17791,SpongeBob,149," Oh, you're the bestest, best friend Patrick! [puts on his disguise] How do I look?
",7
17792,Patrick,149," [Screams] How should I know, mysterious stranger?!? [runs away, screaming. SpongeBob sighs. And the episode comes to a close]",7

17885,Mr. Krabs,150," What on earth for?! Krusty Dogs was your best idea ever boy!
",7
17886,SpongeBob,150," I know. Well, I guess I sorta miss the Krabby Patties. After all, they're what gave this place it's name.

17887,Mr. Krabs,150," Yea, good point.
",7
17888,SpongeBob,150," Yea! Don't' you think we should… [SpongeBob watches Mr. Krabs dash outside and change the sign to ""The Krusty Dogs] Krusty Dogs?! Those wieners have got to go!

17902,SpongeBob,150," Wiener 
",7
17903,Squidward,150," The wiener!

",7
17907,Old lady customer,150," Oh.
",7
17908,SpongeBob,150," And that is to loudly decry these modern, new fangled days of wieners, and to band for a return to a simpler time. A Krabby Pattier time! [looks at customers]
",7
17909,Female customer,150," I'm not really conceded about possible ill-health effects. What about you guys?
",7
17910,Customer #1,150," Eh.

17911,Customer #2,150," What about nostalgia? 
",7
17912,Female customer,150," Never heard of it. [continues eating]
",7
17913,SpongeBob,150," Okay, that didn't work at all.
",7
17914,Squidward,150," It only seems to have increased their appetite for wieners.
",7
17915,SpongeBob,150," We need stronger tactics. 
",7
17916,Squidward,150," Like something that would make Mr. Krabs' wiener thing blow right up in his face! 
",7
17917,SpongeBob,150," Yea, blow up. [facial expression changes to happy] Squidward, that's it! [skips and laughs away]

17926,All customers,150," [begin screaming and angrily leaving]

17928,Mr. Krabs,150," SpongeBob! What happened in here? Where all me customers?! What are we gonna do?
",7
17929,SpongeBob,150," Oooh! I know the answer.

17930,Mr. Krabs,150," [pops in window looking at SpongeBob grilling Krabby Patties] Hey SpongeBob! Have you seen Mr. Squidward? 
",7
17931,SpongeBob,150," I think he's outside on his break.

17944,Squidward,151," [Starts with showing SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward's houses] It's finally complete! [shows Squidward in his house at a table] After weeks and weeks of burning the candle at both ends, [voice calms down] literally, [a double-sided, burned candle is shown, and his voice returns in a louder tone] my first clarinet concerto is complete and ready to be performed! [Squidward falls at a quake, and his clarinet concerto papers fall in the fire of the double-sided candle] NO! [Squidward is quaked again] Now, I'm flummoxed. [Squidward opens his front door, and he hits his head four times as he yells ""Doh, doh, doh, doh""] Drggh. [SpongeBob and Patrick are shown hammering a ""For Rent"" sign]

",7
17953,Squidward,151," Shut it! What are you two dingbats doing?
",7
17954,SpongeBob,151," We were just posting Patrick's new ""For Rent"" sign. Did we work on it all morning, see? [the sign is shown]
",7
17955,Squidward,151," For rent? You mean one of you is moving out?
",7
17956,SpongeBob,151," [laughs] No, Patrick here is just gonna rent out his front yard.
",7
17957,Patrick,151," Need a little extra cash if you know what I mean?
",7
17958,Squidward,151," Wow! To think this day started off so horribly and now... What do you mean you're just gonna rent out your front yard?
",7
17959,Patrick,151," First come, first, serve.
",7
17960,Squidward,151," Oh great, now another idiot can move in.
",7
17961,SpongeBob,151," Oh Squidward, that reminds me. Patrick and I are off to Jellyfish Fields for the day. We were wondering if maybe you can stick around and keep an eye out for any takers.
",7
17962,Squidward,151," Oh I would love to. Just let me check my planner. [takes out his planner and looks in it]
",7

",7
17975,Squidward,151," Aren't we all?
",7
17976,Howard,151," I thought this would be the one place to pursue my passions...

17978,Howard,151," ...play the bassoon...
",7
17979,Squidward,151," The bassoon?
",7
17980,Howard,151," ...and enjoy a nice cup of tea in my front yard.
",7
17981,Squidward,151," [speaks gibberish] I can't believe what I am hearing. [sighs] Finally, a neighbor that has it! I can only imagine! Painting portraits while sipping tea, recumbent bicycling into a museum, and performing a duet at the Bikini Bottom concert! [sighs again]
",7
17982,Howard,151," [leaving] Farewell. I new this was too good to be true.
",7
17983,Squidward,151," [stops him] Wait! [panting] I was...just kidding!
",7
17984,Howard,151," Well, in that case, I should move in right away! [invites Squidward] Make yourself at home.
",7
17985,Squidward,151," Wow, his designs are impeccable! [to Howard] Yes, I do feel ""at home"".
",7
17986,Howard,151," I would like to propose a toast—to a new neighbor.
",7
17987,Squidward,151," To a new neighbor! [they both drink tea]
",7
17988,Howard,151," While we're on the topic, what are the other neighbors like?
",7
17989,Squidward,151," [nervous] Oh! Well, they're just like any other neighbors.
",7
17990,Howard,151," That's neat. I'm the neighbor that likes all kinds of neighbors!
",7
17991,Squidward,151," Well, that's nice!
",7
17992,Howard,151," Well, as long they aren't jellyfishers. [Squidward nearly chokes on his tea] I can't STAND anyone who jellyfishes. But, luckily, they're not the worst kind of neighbor.
",7
17993,Squidward,151," Well, that's nice.
",7
17994,Howard,151," That would be the bubble blowers. [Squid spits out his tea] Between the jellyfishers and the bubble blowers, I just couldn't stand to stay in my old neighborhood anymore.
",7
17995,Squidward,151," Well, you won't even NOTICE what the neighbors around here are like! [Squid looks out the window. SpongeBob and Patrick return from jellyfishing and notice the trailer]

17996,SpongeBob,151," Patrick, look!
",7
17997,Patrick,151," A mobile is parked right in my front yard!

17998,SpongeBob,151," Do you know what that means?

17999,SpongeBob and Patrick,151," Landlord!
",7
18000,Patrick,151," SpongeBob, what do you say we go knock on the door and say ""Hi""?

",7
18003,Howard,151," What's going on? Is someone out there?
",7
18004,Squidward,151," [closes certains] Nope, nobody's out there!
",7
18005,Howard,151," Are you sure? I thought I heard voices.
",7
18006,Squidward,151," There's nobody here!
",7
18007,Howard,151," Perhaps it's the other neighbors coming to meet me. We'd better check.
",7
18008,Squidward,151," No! I can't let you do that!
",7
18009,Howard,151," [chuckles] Well, of course you can. They're your neighbors, too.
",7
18010,Squidward,151," No! You REALLY don't wanna go out there, trust me! [jerks on Howard's arm harder and harder]
",7
18011,Howard,151," You're hurting my arm!
",7
18012,Squidward,151," [lets go] Oh, sorry. I was just wondering if we could...
",7
18013,Howard,151," Could, what?
",7
18014,Squidward,151," Um, form a little duet together. Just you and me. Just the two of us. Together. You know. Me on clarinet and you on bassoon. Why sure!
",7
18015,Patrick,151," Hey, SpongeBob? Did you see the way those curtains jerked shut?
",7
18016,SpongeBob,151," Hmmm. Our new neighbor must be really shy.
",7
18017,Patrick,151," Maybe we could visit him, later.
",7
18018,SpongeBob,151," Yeah, besides, we have more pressing things to attend to—like this jellyfish we've befriended and this brand new bottle of bubbles!
",7
18019,Squidward,151," Phew! That was close.
",7
18020,Howard,151," And a one and a two... [they both olay on their instruments]
",7
18021,Squidward,151," [thinking] Squiddy, this is definitely your best day ever! [SpongeBob and Patrick are heard laughing]
",7
18022,Howard,151," That's funny, I thought I just had this thing tuned.
",7
18023,Squidward,151," Uh, that's me! I think this reed needs replacing. Excuse me for a moment! [runs builds a fence around Howard's house] There! Now, where were we?
",7
18024,Patrick,151," Look! Our new neighbor must be even shyer than we thought!
",7
18025,SpongeBob,151," Yeah. [a bubble pops and a jellyfish stings Patrick.They both laugh]
",7
18026,Squidward,151," Excuse me one more time!
",7
18027,Howard,151," [angry] What's going on? Are you hiding something?
",7
18028,Squidward,151," [nervously] Why, Howard, I would never hide anything from you!
",7
18029,Howard,151," Stand aside! [SpongeBob and Patrick are shown jellyfishing and blowing bubbles] REPULSIVE! Somebody's got to stop these bubble blowing jellyfishers!
",7
18030,Squidward,151," [crying] Please don't leave, Howard! You're the rain of sunshine I've had in years!
",7
18031,Howard,151," I'm sorry, Mr. Tentacles! It's too late for that!
",7
18032,Squidward,151," Oh, Neptune nooooo!
",7
18033,Howard,151," [to SpongeBob and Patrick] You there! [pops a bubble] Hey! That was actually kind of fun! Maybe now's the time I stopped being so stuffy and loosened up for a change! [joins in on the fun]
",7
18034,Squidward,151," I know I can handle two dunderheads, but I draw the line at three! [knocks out the brick and Howard's trailer rolls away]
",7
18035,Howard,151," My house! [runs after it and jumps off the cliff] I knew it was too good to be true!
",7
18036,Squidward,151," [sadly as he holds a piece of the broken sign] Well, I almost had a decent neighbor.
",7
18037,SpongeBob,151," Don't worry, Squidward. We can cheer you up. [blows a bubble]
",7
18038,Patrick,151," Go on. Pop it!
",7
18039,Squidward,151," Well, Squiddy, what have I got to lose? [bubble floats away] Hey, come back here you bubble! [bubble floats over the same cliff and Squidward jumps off of it] JELLYFISHING BUBBLE BLOWERS!",7

Now I wasn't about to stand by and watch a customer go without all his guaranteed nutrients and  vitamins. So I stung in to action.""

",8
18395,Patrick,155," But we sculpted your likeness out of butter on hole five. [cuts to sculpture]

",8
18414,SpongeBob,155," [uneasily] Okay.
",8
18415,Patrick,155," [with microphone and headphones] SpongeBob readies the approach shot. He's gotta be very careful he doesn't hook the shot here, because this would certainly be an inopportune time for a bogey. [SpongeBob swings but stops] A pressure-packed shot to be sure. [leaves]
",8
18416,Bikini Bottomites,155," Aw. [all whisper]
",8
18417,Patrick,155," Looks like we're tied, three shots to three.

18419,Patrick,155," Whatever. [shoots and makes it] AND HE SINKS ANOTHER HOLE IN ONE! That's two in a row!
",8
18420,SpongeBob,155," All right. You wanna play competitive, eh? Observe. [shoots and makes it] Right between the old wickets. Come on bally, don't fail me now.
",8
18421,Patrick,155," Watch out for the water hazard.
",8
18422,SpongeBob,155," Patrick, the only hazard I can see is you standing in my shot.
",8

",8
18437,Patrick,155," Was it a red one?
",8
18438,SpongeBob,155," M-hmm.
",8
18439,Patrick,155," It might have been in the kelp salad.
",8
18440,SpongeBob,155," Patrick, you ate my ball?
",8
18441,Patrick,155," Don't worry, I'll get it.

18442,SpongeBob,155," Patrick, no!
",8
18443,Patrick,155," No?
",8
18444,SpongeBob,155," I have to play the ball where it lies. [goes inside Patrick and opens his mouth] You'll need to leave this open. [goes back inside] Now, let's see, if I was a golf ball, where would I-oh! Next to the gallbladder, of course. Fore! [the ball goes through wall and hits lamp] Where's your ball?
",8
18445,Patrick,155," I don't know. Gotta be around here somewhere. [ball is seen in Patrick's bum hole on outside of his pants]
",8
18446,SpongeBob,155," There it is!
",8
18447,Patrick,155," Uh-oh.
",8
18448,SpongeBob,155," Play it where it lies.
",8
18449,Patrick,155," [angrily grumbling. Cuts to him shooting it and ricocheting off a cabinet to a overhead desk lamp, picture, and through a wall] Hole in one! Top that!
",8
18450,SpongeBob,155," I could do that blindfolded. [Patrick hands him a blindfold]
",8
18451,Patrick,155," Wait up! Warmer. Warmer. Red hot!

18452,SpongeBob,155," [slams a door] Aha!

18454,SpongeBob,155," Patrick... [peeks out]

18455,Patrick,155," Stop peeking! Hotter. [wrecks Squidward's house along the way] Hotter! Hot! Hot! Cold. Hot. Cold. Hot! Cold.

18456,SpongeBob,155," Patrick! This is ridic- [sees Squidward's wrecked house] -ulous. Wow. Squidward's really let this place go. Patrick!

18457,Patrick,155," [in shower] AAAAAHHH!!!!!!!!!!

18458,SpongeBob,155," What are you doing?
",8
18459,Patrick,155," I was just freshening up. These fancy fixtures are touchy [steam builds up around Patrick] Hot! Red hot! Ah! Cold! Cold!
",8
18460,SpongeBob,155," Would you please get back in the game?
",8
18461,Patrick,155," But I wanted to try his loofah.

18462,SpongeBob,155," Those balls have gotta be around here somewhere. Oh, Patrick.

18463,Patrick,155," Uhh, look a little closer, buddy.

18464,SpongeBob,155," [uneasily] Play it where it lies?
",8
18465,Patrick,155," Play it where it lies.
",8
18466,SpongeBob,155," But how are we gonna hit our balls back to my house from here?
",8
18467,Patrick,155," All it takes is a little finesse, SpongeBob. All it takes is a little finesse.
",8
18468,SpongeBob,155," Okay, you're good to go.
",8
18469,Patrick,155," Fore! [wrecks top front of house] It's all yours.

18470,SpongeBob,155," This one's for all the marbles.
",8
18471,Patrick,155," But I thought we weren't betting.
",8
18472,SpongeBob,155," No, I mean whoever wins this hole wins the game. [Squidward wakes up and takes off his blindfold to see SpongeBob and Patrick talking]

18473,Squidward,155," [muffled] What's going on here? [screams]

18474,SpongeBob and Patrick,155," Hole in one! [Squidward sits up]

18550,Mr. Krabs,156," Hey Squidward, what is it with the extra foot, buddy?
",8
18551,Squidward,156," [looks down] Huh? This isn't mine... [foot lifts up] Waaaahhh! [runs]
",8
18552,All,156," [screaming]
",8
18553,Mr. Krabs,156," Not you again!
",8
18554,Sandy,156," Ha! Slimeless snow vermin! You missed!
",8
18555,Mr. Krabs,156," That's weren't the attack.
",8
18556,Sandy,156," Huh?
",8
18557,Mr. Krabs,156," This is it! [Snow Mollusk starts shooting snowballs out of mouth; Mr. Krabs screams and hides behind a pile of snow, blocking the snowballs, Snow Mollusk aims for Gary]
",8
18558,SpongeBob,156," Gary! [shields Gary with himself, the snowballs go into SpongeBob's holes, and they come out from the side holes. SpongeBob stands up and runs away with Gary. The Snow Mollusk aims for Squidward]
",8
18559,Squidward,156," [running and screams; jumps into water] Oh... not again... [floats up in a block of ice again, but with a disappointed face]
",8
18560,Mr. Krabs,156," [???] [everyone sneaks away, Sandy brings the sleigh]
",8
18561,SpongeBob,156," What is that formidable creature?
",8
18562,Mr. Krabs,156," That, me boy, is none other than the Abominable Snow Mollusk.
",8
18563,SpongeBob,156," I thought that was just a myth.
",8
18564,Mr.Krabs,156," Oh, you sure? She's no myth! She's as real as Santy Claus. Back when I was young sea captain, [flashback to when Mr. Krabs was a captain] sailing in the Atlantic sea.[???] [Snow Mollusk pops out of sea, young Mr. Krabs gasps, and Snow Mollusk picks up the ship]
",8
18565,SpongeBob,156," Don't tell me, Mr. Krabs. You peeled at those tentacles with your bare claws! You single-handedly saved your vessel from certain DOOM!
",8
18566,Mr. Krabs,156," Nope, that didn't work. [flashback continues] [???] [Snow Mollusk swallows all people on ship including Mr. Krabs]
",8
18567,SpongeBob,156," Oh, my! Well at least you bravely escaped out the tail.
",8
18568,Mr. Krabs,156," Weren't bravery that got us out. Let's just say... We had to wait... for nature, to take its course. [flashback to people in Snow Mollusk's stomach, a bubble floats up and pops, then a flushing sound is heard]
",8
18569,SpongeBob,156," Hm? Oh! Ew.
",8
18570,Sandy,156," I'd hate to break up story time, but I'd like to NOT GET EATEN today! [Snow Mollusk's roaring is heard, and everyone gets on sleigh, Snow Mollusk finds them, they leave]
",8
18571,SpongeBob,156," Gary! Step on it! [Snow Mollusk follows] Oh yeah, Gary, you are really motivated now! Right, guys? [cuts to back of sleigh, and one of the seats are empty with a ""Squidward"" sign in its place] We forgot Squidward! [sleigh takes a U-turn, and goes between the Snow Mollusk's tentacles] Left, Gary! Left! There he is!
",8
18572,SpongeBob,156," Patrick, I need a Gooey Worm!
",8
18573,Patrick,156," Oh, be careful, this is my last one! [hands SpongeBob a red Gooey Worm]
",8
18574,SpongeBob,156," Hold on tight! [gives Patrick one end of the Gooey Worm and glides down holding the other one]
",8
18575,Gary,156," Meow. [as SpongeBob is saving Squidward, the Snow Mollusk finds him]
",8
18576,Patrick,156," SpongeBob! Come on! [cuts to SpongeBob on Squidward, with Gooey Worm tied on ice block] Let's get outta here! [pulls SpongeBob up, and Snow Mollusk lands on the water. When they are leaving, SpongeBob throws away the Gooey Worm, and falls into Snow Mollusk's mouth when she's getting up, she likes it]
",8
18577,Sandy,156," Woo, wee! That was a close one, wasn't it, Mr. Krabs? Huh? [in Mr. Krabs' seat, there is a pile of snow with coral as a nose and eyes] Of all the horn swabbles! The banit's trying to win us out so he can get the prize himself! [throws fake Mr. Krabs out of the sleigh]
",8
18578,Mr. Krabs,156," Argargarg! I'd sooner swallow a jellyfish the winning with y-- [jellyfish flies into Mr. Krabs' mouth and stings him.]
",8
18579,Sandy,156," We can't let that double crosser beat us to the loot! Full speed ahead and don't stop for nothin', Gary!
",8
18580,Patrick,156," Hey! [takes rope and stops Gary, making the sleigh fling Sandy out]
",8
18581,Sandy,156," [in snow] What's the big emergency, Patrick?
",8
18582,Patrick,156," I saw something shiny.
",8
18583,Sandy,156," [sarcastic] Oh! Well, let's drop EVERYTHING, then!
",8
18584,SpongeBob,156," No wait Sandy, I see it too! It looks like... Karen.
",8
18585,SpongeBob,156," [helps Karen up] Karen?
",8
18586,Sandy,156," I say she's in quick need of a reboot! Heee ya! [kicks Karen with her boot, shattering the ice on her]
",8
18587,SpongeBob,156," [hears someone saying ""you can't stand a chance, Krabs""] Huh? [sees fake Plankton and picks it up] Plankton? [fake Plankton says ""don't tell Krabs""] Poor guy, the ice is really getting to him.
",8
18588,Patrick,156," [grabs fake Plankton] We gotta bust him out, quick! I'm gonna sit on him! [puts fake Plankton on a rock, preparing to sit on it]
",8
18589,SpongeBob,156," Patrick, no! He's very--[Patrick sits on fake Plankton]...fragile. [Patrick gets up, showing bits of metal with wires, a speaker, and an eye, broken, it says ""Krabs zzz... stand zzz...""]
",8
18590,Sandy,156," A citylacra!
",8
18591,SpongeBob,156," [covers Gary's ""ears""] Sandy, please! Language!
",8
18592,Sandy,156," Naw, silly! I'm saying, Plankton set up a robotic dummy in his sled!
",8
18593,Karen,156," That's right. My selfish husband remains in warm, sunny Bikini Bottom,[???], in fact, [cuts to Plankton with fake Plankton and Karen in his lab] this whole race was a plot devised by Plankton. [cuts to Plankton sneaking away before the race] With the entire town distracted, he pursues the Krabby Patty formula undetected.
",8
18594,SpongeBob,156," Pursue? Formula? We've gotta find Mr. Krabs right now!
",8
18595,Sandy,156," And exactly how do you propose we find him?
",8
18596,Karen,156," I saw Mr. Krabs pass by [screen shows Mr. Krabs running] just before my system failed, heading southwest.
",8
18597,SpongeBob,156," Well, what are we waiting for? [picks Karen, Sandy, Patrick up and throws them into the sleigh, and gets in himself] You heard the lady, Gary, southwest! Marsh! Marsh!
",8
18598,Plankton,156," [sprays safe with flamethrower] Hehehehe! [touches handle, which is glowing red due to extreme heat] Yooooouch! [blows hand] So the safe isn't[???]of flame, eh? It seems as though I'll have to get a little more DESTRUCTIVE! [accidentally takes out teddy bear, then puts it back] Ahem! I meant DESTRUCTIVE! [takes out a stick of dynamite]
",8
18599,Gary,156," '[tired]' Mooowww, meow meow meow moooww...
",8
18600,SpongeBob,156," A little more, Gary!
",8
18601,All,156," AAAAA!
",8
18602,SpongeBob & Patrick,156," Ahh, whew.
",8
18603,Sandy,156," Look out! [cliff ahead]
",8
18604,SpongeBob & Patrick,156," [both scream]
",8
18605,Sandy,156," Hold on, SpongeBob! [picks up SpongeBob and throws him on another hill's tip, the sleigh goes in a circle with SpongeBob as the turning point, but Squidward, still frozen, flys off in the progress]
",8
18606,SpongeBob,156," [with bruises on face, missing teeth and extra long legs and arms] We made it! Right, Squidward? [cuts to Squidward falling down]
",8
18607,Sandy,156," Gasp! Oh my gosh! Patrick! Wing to the other side! [Patrick turns, and the sleigh goes down following Squidward] Excuse me, ma'am
",8
18608,Karen,156," What?
",8
18609,Sandy,156," Gotcha!
",8
18610,SpongeBob,156," Hey Sandy, have you given any thought to we're gonna--[sleigh crashes to the ground, making everyone flat]...land. [Snow Mollusk spots them]
",8
18611,Plankton,156," [with a shield] Fire in the hole! [dynamite explodes, and safe is completely fine] Rats.
",8
18612,Sandy,156," Look, fellas, I know it's cold. But let's just push forward and keep a lookout for a frozen crab! [closes one eye]
",8
18613,Patrick,156," [with lots of ice on eyes] I can't feel my looking holes!
",8
18614,SpongeBob,156," The only thing I can feel is my empty stomach. [stomach implodes]
",8
18615,Sandy,156," You said it, SpongeBob! I already gnawed through my[???] [holds up empty nut bag] I'm getting to the point where I can eat just about ANYTHING! [eyes get bloodshot and drools, then thinks SpongeBob is cooked and on a stick] Mmmm... sponge kabob... [shakes head] Hey Patrick, you got any more of that Gooey Worms on you?
",8
18616,Patrick,156," I wish I did. I lost my last one to the monster and now I'm so hungry! At least, [takes out bag of Jelly Beans] I still have this bag of Jelly Beans to hold me over. [eats a Jelly Bean] Hey! Is this taxi even moving?! [Gary shivering] Come on, Gary! [Gary falls]
",8
18617,SpongeBob,156," Gasp! Gary! [Gary's slime is frozen] Oh, you poor fella! We put you too hard to[???]Sorry, I won't make you[???]another inch. [puts Gary in sleigh]
",8
18618,Patrick,156," Great, now we're stuck.
",8
18619,SpongeBob,156," No, we're not! We'll--[pulls ropes, and his arms shatter] Hello, what's this? [cuts to a small anchor] Look! One of Mr. Krabs' sailor tattoos! It must've frozen off his brittle body.
",8
18620,Sandy,156," We must be heading in the right direction!
",8
18621,Plankton,156," [riding a small plane] [laughing] Secret formula, you are mine! [ejects himself out of plane]
",8
18622,Plankton,156," Perhaps I misjudged the skill on that one. [landing] That does it! Listen up safe, I will steal your content, even if I have to tear you apart. [rips a piece of the safe] Bit by bit. [rips the piece he just rips] Molecule by molecule. [rips a molecule] Atom by atom! [rips an atom, causing it to glow] Uh-oh.
",8
18623,Plankton,156," Surely, the safe couldn't survive nuclear detonation. Come to papa! [takes the bottle containing the secret formula]
",8
18624,Patrick,156," [wakes up] Hey, trying to sleep.
",8
18625,SpongeBob,156," [realizes that he hits Mr. Krabs] Mr. Krabs!
",8
18626,Sandy,156," He doesn't look so good. We better get him to the sleigh, SpongeBob. SpongeBob?[realizes SpongeBob is frozen] SpongeBob! He froze up too. [realizes that the others also frozen. Makes a fire form the sleigh to thaw them out]
",8
18627,Squidward,156," Aaah. What? You're burning the sleigh? Are you aware that's our mode of transportation?
",8
18628,Sandy,156," And are you aware I just saved your life?
",8
18629,Mr. Krabs,156," The race! The million clams! [gasps] I've been trapped in ice, mutinous thieves trying to cheat me out of me winnings. [rattles Squidward]
",8
18630,Karen,156," Oh cool down there are no winnings, you've been duped!
",8
18631,Mr. Krabs,156," Duped? You don't mean by...
",8
18632,Karen,156," Now you're putting it together!
",8
18633,Mr. Krabs,156," My formula! We've got to get back to Bikini Bottom!
",8
18634,Squidward,156,"  We's might have actually a chance of getting back if we had a sleigh.
",8
18635,Mr. Krabs,156," We're doomed. Oh hoho! [cries]
",8
18636,SpongeBob,156,"  No we're not Mr. Krabs. [turns himself into sleigh] Your chariot awaits!
",8
18637,Mr. Krabs,156," No offense, but we're not going to catch Plankton moving at a snail's pace.
",8
18638,Sandy,156," Just leave that to the scientist of the group!
",8
18639,Patrick,156,"  Oh geez... why do I have to do everything?
",8
18640,Sandy,156," [Sandy creates a modified sleigh. Patrick is spinning from Karen's monitor as Squidward blows his clarinet onto the circuits]
",8
18641,Patrick,156," Hahahaha!
",8
18642,Sandy,156," She's all fired up!
",8
18643,SpongeBob,156," Gary, Mr. Krabs, any hazards on the horizon?
",8
18644,Mr. Krabs,156," Lookin' clear so far.
",8
18645,SpongeBob,156," Squidward keep those circuits warm. Patrick hang on!
",8
18646,French Narrator,156," One frozen wasteland later.
",8
18647,SpongeBob,156," Hooray! We made it.
",8
18648,Mr. Krabs,156," Okay... then where's my restaurant?
",8
18649,SpongeBob,156," Perhaps over there.. [points to smoldering place]
",8
18650,Mr. Krabs,156," And where's my formula? [runs over to safe]
",8
18651,Sandy,156," [points to Chum Bucket] Perhaps over there.
",8
18652,Mr. Krabs,156," The Chum Bucket, now serving... Krabby Patties?! [reading Chum Bucket sign]
",8
18653,SpongeBob,156," We're too late!
",8
18654,Mr. Krabs,156," We'll see about that boy-o!
",8
18655,Harold,156," [Mr. Krabs walks past line] Woah woah woah woah, you can't cut in line. We've been waiting for a Krabby Patty for three stinking days!
",8
18656,Mr. Krabs,156," This will only take a minute. [smashes door]
",8
18657,Plankton,156,"  Keep your pants on out there! I'll get your Krabby Patty just as soon as I get this bottle open. [tries to open cork from the formula bottle]
",8
18658,Mr. Krabs,156," Not if I have anything to say and or do about it!
",8
18659,Plankton,156," Krabs! Why aren't you frozen under the barren tundra?
",8
18660,Mr. Krabs,156," I guess I didn't want to miss the grand unveiling of my sandwich.
",8
18661,Plankton,156,"  Well it would have happened if I could've dislodge this stupid cork!
",8
18662,Patrick,156," Oh, that's easy! [lifts it out of the bottle.]
",8
18663,All of them,156," PATRICK!
",8
18664,Plankton,156," Hahaha! I got it now, Krabsy. [beings to run away]
",8
18665,Sandy,156,"  That may be true Plankton but you've got seven angry customers flanking you on all sides.
",8
18666,Karen,156," [sarcastically] You've gotta help me... My monitor nearly froze up for good on your little race to oblivion!
",8
18667,Plankton,156," Babe don't blow an on amp over this, c'mon! [Karen zaps Plankton]
",8
18668,Plankton,156," Yowza! Ow! That hurt on so many levels... Okay, I give up. You win again, Krabs.
",8
18669,Mr. Krabs,156," Then hand over my formula.
",8
18670,Plankton,156," Okay Eugene. I'll just sign the surrender treaty first. [He pulls out a pen and clicks it. It turns into a propeller.] Oops, here I go. Hahahaha! Looks like I've out smarted you again aye fools? [ laughs and flies away into a pipe]
",8
18671,Mr. Krabs,156," You get back here, Plankton!
",8
18672,SpongeBob,156,"  Here we go again...
",8
18673,Plankton,156," [exits through a vent outside the Chum Bucket, with everyone in close pursuit]
",8
18674,Mr. Krabs,156," Give up now and I'll let you keep one of your antenna!
",8
18675,Plankton,156," I'd be delighted to see you try! Ooooooh, you're so close. [Plankton runs up some stair, and hops on top of something. The others follow him.] So long suckers!
",8
18676,Mr. Krabs,156," Huh?
",8
18677,Everyone,156," [gasps when they realize they’re inside a cage]
",8
18678,Plankton,156," Hehehe!
",8
18679,Mr. Krabs,156," We're trapped!
",8
18680,Plankton,156," That's right Krabs and if you're thinking of busting out, mind the giant vat of fry grease beneath you.
",8
18681,Mr. Krabs,156," He's going to turn us into fried snacks!
",8
18682,Plankton,156," Got any dipping sauce? A little taste of your own medicine aye crab cakes?
",8
18683,Abominable Snow Mollusk,156," [makes loud noise, and grabs the cage] Nom nom!
",8
18684,SpongeBob,156," Nom nom?
",8
18685,Abominable Snow Mollusk,156," Nom nom! [rips the cage open, making everyone in it fall to the ground. She then snatches Patrick] Nom nom!
",8
18686,SpongeBob,156," W-wait big scary monster. Don't eat Patrick. Eat me packed with nutrients!
",8
18687,Sandy,156," No, eat me!
",8
18688,Mr. Krabs,156," Don't eat me, eat Squidward!
",8
18689,Squidward,156," Wait what?!
",8
18690,Abominable Snow Mollusk,156," [reaches and takes jellybeans from Patrick’s pocket] Nom nom! [hugs Patrick]
",8
18691,SpongeBob,156," She loves your jellybeans Patrick!
",8
18692,Plankton,156," I better go while the going's good.
",8
18693,Abominable Snow Mollusk,156," [sees Patrick] Jellybean!
",8
18694,Plankton,156," I can practically taste those Krabby Patties now! [The Abominable Mollusk grabs him with her tongue; Plankton screams as she swallows him and Plankton releases the formula. It lands into Mr. Krabs' claw and he puts it in his shirt.]
",8
18695,SpongeBob,156," Hey, Mr. Krabs, what happens to Plankton?
",8
18696,Mr. Krabs,156," He'll have to wait for nature to take its' course. [laughs]
",8
18697,Plankton,156," [The Abominable Snow mollusk belches and inside her stomach there's Plankton sitting on a jellybean.] Well I suppose dear old dad was right. I should have minored in business administration. [a flushing noise is then heard in the background, concluding the episode]",8

18720,Squidward,157," [From his window] Would you two mind stopping with your baby games!? Didn't anybody tell you it's the break of dawn!?
",8
18721,SpongeBob,157," Oh, good morning Squidward! Yeah, Patrick here told me.
",8
18722,Squidward,157," When are you two gonna grow up?
",8
18723,Patrick,157," How do you play that?
",8
18724,SpongeBob,157," Oh!? Maybe Squidward can come down and teach us how to play it! That will be real fun won't it Patrick? [Notices Patrick has fallen asleep. He scratches himself with his leg while he is sleeping. Then SpongeBob notices another boat] AHHHHHhhhhhhhhhhh... [Falls down] It just not the same without Patrick playing along too. [Taps Patrick who still is sleeping] Alright Patrick, you leave me no choice. [Pinches Patrick and he wakes up]
",8
18725,Patrick,157," Ow! [Turns around with something fuzzy on his face] What's the big idea!?

",8
18729,Patrick,157," Wow! You really think so? [Squidward appears behind him]
",8
18730,Squidward,157," And everybody knows that grown-ups never play with kids! And on that note, I would like to personally commend the sea star for taking his first baby steps into the adult world! Facial hair is a good start I suppose.
",8
18731,Patrick,157," I am curious to know what mature people, like Squidward, do. Won't you show me?

18735,Patrick,157," Hooray!

18736,Squidward,157," In the hopes that a quiet, grown-up neighborhood will prevail at last. Moving me one step closer to peace and blissy tranquility. A place where I can-

18737,SpongeBob,157," Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
",8
18738,Squidward,157," What?
",8
18739,SpongeBob,157," May I tag along and observe your instruction?
",8
18740,Squidward,157," Why in a million years will I let you tag along?
",8
18741,SpongeBob,157," Because some of your instructions in maturity will rub off on me! Bringing us TWO steps closer to a quiet, grown-up neighborhood!
",8
18742,Squidward,157," Wow, that actually makes sense. It must be working already!
",8
18743,SpongeBob,157," Is that a yes?

",8
18831,Mr. Krabs,158," Yeah, well your coda is affecting me quota. The shrill piercing racket of your fish flute is frightening away me money.

18841,Plankton,158," No, computer-brain. The skinny one may have been the gateway to the secret formula all along. As a veteran employee, he must know the secret formula, too.

18864,Plankton,158," None of my tactics are making any impression on him whatsoever.

18884,Squidward,158," I'm so glad you're enjoying the performance.

18885,Plankton,158," Enjoying it? Why, I'm enjoying it so much, it's making me want to... it's making me want to...

18893,Plankton,158," Say, uh, musical genius?
",8
18894,Squidward,158," Yes?
",8
18895,Plankton,158," When you're not sharing your songs of joy and splendor, one might find you working a shift at the Krusty Krab, correct?
",8
18896,Squidward,158," It is an unfortunate truth.
",8
18897,Plankton,158," And you've been working there for a pretty long time, haven't you?
",8
18898,Squidward,158," That's an understatement.
",8
18899,Plankton,158," Well, I... I was just wondering, O incredibly musical one, what do they put in one of those Krabby Patties, anyway... secret-wise?
",8
18900,Squidward,158," Oh, I don't work the grill; I work the register. [plays clarinet]
",8
18901,Plankton,158," But... surely, you've been near the grill. You must've seen something.
",8
18902,Squidward,158," Nope. Haven't seen a thing. [continues playing]
",8
18903,Plankton,158," You work in the same place for 20 years and you've never noticed ingredients of the sole item on your menu? Cut the comedy, octopus! I want that formula and I want it now!
",8
18904,Squidward,158," Oh, don't you see, Sheldon? Thanks to you, I'm getting better and better as a musician.
",8
18905,Plankton,158," What?
",8
18906,Squidward,158," It's been your constant encouragement that has helped me progress to new musical heights. I'm hitting notes I never even knew existed. [inhales, plays clarinet off-key, windows shatter]

18907,Mrs. Puff,158," We have— [glass shattering]
",8
18908,Sandy,158," Mayday! Mayday!
",8
18909,Squidward,158," In fact, thanks to you, I'm going to quit my job at the Krusty Krab and become a full-time musician.
",8
18910,Plankton,158," But then I'll never get my hands on that secret formula. [growls, ear plugs pop] Uh-oh. My professional-grade earplugs! No! [earplugs sproing, Squidward begins to inhale, Plankton goes after the earplugs] Come back, I need you! [clarinet plays off-key; Plankton screams and takes the clarinet] Stop playing this infernal pipe! You're killing me!
",8
18911,Squidward,158," Hey! [panting] Come back!
",8
18912,SpongeBob,158," Whoo! I wanna play!
",8
18913,Plankton,158," [pants] Aha! Okay, fish-flute, time to play a little avant-garde. Guardrail, that is. [laughs, he slides down a staircase with the clarinet and keeps running, SpongeBob and Squidward fall down and start to grunt and groan]
",8
18914,SpongeBob,158," Ouch, Squidward, this game is fun!

18915,Plankton,158," You'll never catch me, you hear! Never!

18918,Police fish #1,158," We've received hundreds of reports of an excruciating musical disturbance and you're the only one holding an instrument.

18919,Plankton,158," Wait a minute, I've never seen this instrument before in my life.

19176,Patrick,160," As I was saying... (clears throat) I was lying around my house, not even planning to have a vacation when I heard a knock at my door. (Flashback. SpongeBob walks up to Patrick's rock and knocks on it. Patrick moans) For clammin' out loud! Aww, sheesh! I'm still not there yet? (grunts. Opens his rock with a key.

19178,Patrick,160," (panting) I've been waking up, eating, sleeping, waking up, eating, sleeping, waking up, eating, sleeping for my whole life without a rest.

19236,SpongeBob,161," Wha, wha, wha, why not?

19237,Sandy,161," Because, as we leave Earth's gravity, everything becomes weightless, and any un-contained food will float off in all directions!
",8
19238,SpongeBob,161," Oh. Is that a bad thing?
",8
19239,Sandy,161," Only if it gets sucked into the reverse spatial linearity drive. [cake floats into the reverse spatial linearity drive. The rocket engine malfunctions and turns off] Ah nuts!

19241,Sandy,161," [presses ""Toss"" button, and gets dressed in a large space suit] Well, it's a good thing I've brought my special space suit designed for just this kind of situation!

19248,SpongeBob,161," What's moon crater boarding?
",8
19249,SpongeBob,161," Oh gee Sandy. I don't know. This looks kinda scary.

19250,Sandy,161," Oh, come on SpongeBob. You got this! It's a can of corn.
",8
19251,SpongeBob,161," I don't know what corn is, but I sure like cans. Alright, I'll give it a try. [jumps on board and floats off into space] Sandy, this doesn't seem right.

19252,Sandy,161," Uh oh! Looks like SpongeBob's too light for lunar gravity. SpongeBob, grab a hold of this! [lassos asteroid to SpongeBob]

19255,SpongeBob,161," [SpongeBob continues screaming, and begins to surf over a satellite] Hey, this is kind of fun! [leaps, and bounces off the satellite, damaging it]

19257,Patrick,161," Hey! Who's Carol's real father?!

19258,SpongeBob,161," [scene returns to SpongeBob] Watch this Sandy! [ties an asteroid to his helmet to hold him down] Alright. A no-look... let's see... a one-footed, tongue-out, flip, leg up… [accidentally smashes into rocket's fuel tank, making it leak] puncture into the side of the rocket.
",8
19259,Sandy,161," You did great, SpongeBob! But, you should call your trick the ""no-look, one-footed, tongue-out, flip, leg up, puncture the fuel tank on the rocket.”
",8
19260,SpongeBob,161," Oops!
",8
19261,Sandy,161," Come on, SpongeBob. We gotta get while there's still enough fuel to make it home!
",8
19262,SpongeBob,161," Wait! I have to do something very important! [takes picture of himself “holding the earth”] There! [both go into the rocket, and head for earth] So, we are going to make it, aren’t we Sandy?
",8
19263,Sandy,161," If the fuel holds out, there's no reason to panic. [rocket fuel signs shows “Empty”. Rocket starts falling to earth] Without the engines, we've lost all control. We're coming in too steep!
",8
19264,SpongeBob,161," Is that bad?
",8
19265,Sandy,161," [unbuckles seatbelt] Only if you consider being consumed in a giant fireball “bad”.
",8
19266,SpongeBob,161," Well, in that case, I won’t… giant fireball?! [unbuckles seatbelt, but hits wall] Sandy, where are you going?
",8
19267,Sandy,161," 'm going to take this bull by the horns! [Lassos the nose of the rocket. Rocket begins to catch fire as it descends towards earth]
",8
19268,SpongeBob,161," Are we gonna get consumed in a giant fireball?
",8
19269,Sandy,161," Not if I can keep her nose up we aren't. Hang on! It's gonna get bumpy when we hit the atmosphere. [the rocket keeps falling at a faster rate. SpongeBob yells in terror] Yeehaw!
",8
19270,SpongeBob,161," [continues screaming] My goodness!
",8
19271,Sandy,161," Yeehaw! Yeehaw!!! [rockets crashes]
",8
19272,SpongeBob,161," Oh, oh my gosh! Sandy! Sandy, are you okay? [Sandy groans] Oh, Sandy. I'm sorry I ruined your vacation.
",8
19273,Sandy,161," Ruined? Oh heck no! That was the most fun I've had in a toad's age! Once I get my rocket fixed, you and me is heading to Mars. Now, let's go grab another one of them sheet cakes.

19364,SpongeBob,162," We were just minding our own business and a haunted houseboat fell out of the sky!
",8
19365,Patrick,162," [muffled] And it was full of ghosts! The really, real kind, not fake kind!
",8
19366,SpongeBob,162," The captain of the ghost gave us this doubloon and told us to buy him a new head gasket! And then, he took our souls and he put them in bottles and he said he's going to turn us into ghosts if we don't get that head gasket! You gotta help us, Mr. Krabs! I feel so empty without my soul!
",8
19367,Mr. Krabs,162," Did you say doubloon? [Grabs doubloon] Let me see that! Hmm, looks somewhat authentic [sniffs doubloon] Smells real enough! [Bites doubloon, which knocks out his tooth. Goes to Frank's car and steals his head gasket]
",8
19368,Frank,162," Hey!
",8
19369,Mr. Krabs,162," Okay, let's go see those ghosts, fellers! We'll catch 'em and take their gold!
",8
19370,SpongeBob,162," But Mr. Krabs! We don't know the first thing about ghost hunting!
",8
19371,Sandy,162," I'll catch your ghosts for ya! It'll be easy with my new fangled critter-detector-catcher gizmo!
",8
19372,Squidward,162," And you just happened to bring that with you... to the Krusty Krab?
",8
19373,Sandy,162," Sure, I was looking for milkshake gremlins!
",8
19374,Sandy,162," Nope, none in there!
",8
19375,Mr. Krabs,162," Great, then it's settled, let's go catch us some ghost gold!
",8
19376,Squidward,162," What makes you think I have any interest in your delusional adventurism?
",8
19377,Mr. Krabs,162," Come on, Squidward! Think about what those treasures can do for the Krusty Krab, eh? Huh? Why, I can buy you that break room you've always wanted!
",8
19378,Squidward,162," Okay, I'm in!
",8
19379,Mr. Krabs,162," Super! Let's go catch us some treasure! So what do you say, SpongeBob! Are ya ready!
",8
19380,SpongeBob,162," I'll go, but just to get my soul back.
",8
19381,Mr. Krabs,162," Who needs a soul when you're filthy rich?
",8
19382,SpongeBob,162," So here it is. Pretty creepy, huh?
",8
19383,Sandy,162," This place looks like it hasn't been lived in for years.
",8
19384,Patrick,162," Four years? Gotta be longer than that.
",8
19385,Squidward,162," I don't see any signs of ghosts [walks over to painting of a man with a pitchfork and woman standing together] Nothing here but a bunch of tacky, old furniture, and boring, representational art. [Man in picture comes alive and eats woman's head] Huh?
",8
19386,SpongeBob,162," Look, Mr. Krabs! The doubloons!
",8
19387,Mr. Krabs,162," [gasps] Ha-ha-ha [Mr. Krabs licks the doubloons in celebration]
",8
19388,SpongeBob,162," Mr. Krabs, I wouldn't touch that if I were you! That gold probably has ghost germs all over it.
",8
19389,Mr. Krabs,162," Oh, don't be silly, SpongeBob! There's no such things as germs. [grabs a sack and puts doubloons in it] Heads up, Squidward! [Krabs throws bag to Squidward, which hits him in the head] Hey, Patrick, think fast!
",8
19390,Patrick,162," Think? [Bag of doubloons hits Patrick]
",8
19391,Mr. Krabs,162," All righty, then. Let's get while the getting's good! Ooh! [Notices a doubloon is left behind] Looks like I missed one! Uh... it seems to be stuck... uuuuuuhhhh... [pulls out Lord Poltergeist and screams]
",8
19392,Lord Poltergeist,162," Who dares touch me gold?
",8
19393,SpongeBob,162," It's just us, Mr. Ghost Captain, sir. We brought the replacement gasket you asked for. So if it's not too much trouble, do you think you could give us our souls back... now... maybeee.
",8
19394,Lord Poltergeist,162," A deal's a deal and I'm a man of me word. Here you go, square one.
",8
19395,SpongeBob,162," Aah. That hits the spot!
",8
19396,Lord Poltergeist,162," Think fast, pink one!
",8
19397,Patrick,162," Again?
",8
19398,Patrick,162," My soul. [Licks it off the floor]
",8
19399,Lord Poltergeist,162," Har-har-har. Those weren't your souls. Those were just a couple of old orange sodas that have been sitting in the sun too long!
",8
19400,Patrick,162," Well, I thought mine seemed a little flat.
",8
19401,SpongeBob,162," But what about our real souls?
",8
19402,Lord Poltergeist,162," Eh, I never had 'em. Everyone knows you can't hold onto a wild soul. Well, now that that's settled, there's still a little matter of... [Poltergeist notices Squidward, Mr. Krabs, and Patrick taking off with his gold] Me gold! Stop right there! No one touches me booty and gets away with it.
",8
19403,Mr. Krabs,162," Pfttttt! You ghosts don't scare me! You're nothing but thin air! Grab your sacks and follow me, boys! [Krabs opens a door, which leads to the Void, which he is sucked into] Noooooooooooooooooooo!
",8
19404,Lord Poltergeist,162," Ha-har-har-har. Welcome to the Void! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
",8
19405,Patrick,162," Get me out of here!
",8
19406,Squidward,162," Nooooooooooooooooooo!
",8
19407,Lord Poltergeist,162," Ha-har-har-har-har! [Poltergeist sucks in Patrick]
",8
19408,Patrick,162," Nooooooooooooooooo!
",8
19409,Mr. Krabs,162," Hmm. So this is limbo. Well, at least I have a sack full of doubloons to spend eternity with. Uh-oh. Gotta use the can! [Krabs notices that there's a port-a-potty nearby] Ooh. There's a bit of luck. A portable potty. What's this here? ""Insert doubloon?"" Nooooooooooooo!
",8
19410,Patrick,162," Wow. This void sure is relaxing! [A doughnut shows up on Patrick's head] Hey! I've got a doughnut on my head! Come here, you. [Patrick's head stretches] Hey! Get back here! [Patrick's head stretches more and he screams] Why is this happening to me?[Doughnut comes to life]
",8
19411,Doughnut,162," Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Welcome to your worst nightmare [Patrick screams in terror] Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Hmm? Hey, stupid? Don't you wanna eat me?
",8
19412,Patrick,162," Not really. I don't like plain doughnuts.
",8
19413,Doughnut,162," Well, what kind do you like?
",8
19414,Patrick,162," Um, I like sprinkles!
",8
19415,Doughnut,162," Aah. Voila!
",8
19416,Patrick,162," No, chocolate! No, a bagel! No-no-no-no, pancakes! No-no-no...
",8
19417,Doughnut,162," Hey, pick one, so we can get on with your eternal torment!
",8
19418,Patrick,162," Okay, okay! Man, you're pushy! How about... a Krabby Patty? With pickles! And ketchup! Wait, wait, wait, I know! I want... a plain doughnut!
",8
19419,Doughnut,162," Nooooooooooooooooooo!
",8
19420,Squidward,162," Oh, great. I wonder what my vision of eternal suffering will be! [A large, ghost version of SpongeBob is shown with Squidward on its nose] Of course!
",8
19421,Giant Demonic SpongeBob,162," Hiiii, neighbor! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
",8
19422,Squidward,162," I guess this is the part where I start screaming. [screams]
",8
19423,Sandy,162," Hey, corpse breath! You better let my friends out of there if you know what's good for ya!
",8
19424,Lord Poltergeist,162," Ha-ha-ha... And if I don't, what'll ye do about it, me bubble-headed lassy?
",8
19425,Sandy,162," Oh, you'll be laughing out the other side of your tombstone once you've had a taste of my ghost-catcher!
",8
19426,Lord Poltergeist,162," Oh! The big chipmunk's gonna get us! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
",8
19427,Mr. Krabs,162," Thanks, lassie. Now, let's just get this here bag of doubloons back to the Krusty Krab!
",8
19428,Lord Poltergeist,162," Not so fast! That there booty be mine! [Poltergeist sucks bag into treasure chest]
",8
19429,Mr. Krabs,162," Hey, you thieving bilge rat! I stole this gold fair and square! [Mr. Krabs and Poltergeist beat up each other trying to get possession of treasure chest, which flies into the air]
",8
19430,SpongeBob,162," I got it! [Treasure chest crushes SpongeBob]
",8
19431,Mr. Krabs,162," Me gold!
",8
19432,Lord Poltergeist,162," You mean my gold!
",8
19433,SpongeBob,162," Hey, that's funny! Hmm, this chest says it belongs to the Flying Dutchman!
",8
19434,Sandy,162," The Flying Dutchman?! You ain't afraid he's gonna want it back?
",8
19435,Lord Poltergeist,162," Nah, nah! We used to be part of the Dutchman's crew. We stole his gold hundreds of years ago! But the Dutchman hasn't found us yet. And he never will!
",8
19436,Flying Dutchman,162," Avast!
",8
19437,Lord Poltergeist and Sandy,162," [look out the door] Huh?
",8
19438,Flying Dutchman,162," Heave to... and prepare to be boarded by the Flying Dutchman!
",8
19439,Lord Poltergeist,162," The Dutchman! How did he track us down? Unless, thar be a snitch aboard!
",8
19440,SpongeBob,162," [holding a phone] It is my civic duty to report stolen property!
",8
19441,Lord Poltergeist,162," Why, you scurvy little scum-scrubber! You've ruined everything!
",8
19442,Squidward,162," Welcome to my world.
",8
19443,Flying Dutchman,162," Avast there, you scurvy thieving barnacle bass!
",8
19444,Lord Poltergeist,162," [nervously] Dutchman! Boy, am I glad we finally found you!
",8
19445,Flying Dutchman,162," So, it be me old first mate who stole me gold and me crew!
",8
19446,Lord Poltergeist,162," Stole your gold? We just went out to get pizza!
",8
19447,Flying Dutchman,162," Um, that was 300 years ago!
",8
19448,Lord Poltergeist,162," Um, we got lost? But we've been looking for ye ever since... to give ye back your treasure!
",8
19449,Flying Dutchman,162," Me booty! Well, maybe I misjudged you fellas! I'm sorry I was so cross with ya! [Lord Poltergeist sails away with the treasure] Why, you treacherous sea devils! When I'm done with you, you... [Lord Poltergeist runs over the Dutchman and flies away] Okay, now I'm a little bit peeved!
",8
19450,Lord Poltergeist,162," Ha-ha-ha! Eh, that Dutchman was always a sap!
",8
19451,Sandy,162," Frog whiskers! The Dutchman's on our tail!
",8
19452,Lord Poltergeist,162," Eh, now that the engine's fixed, the Dutchman will never catch up with aye. [Engine dies down] Boiler room, we're losing power! Report! The engine's on fire, sir! [Engine explodes]
",8
19453,Sandy,162," The Dutchman's gaining on us!
",8
19454,Lord Poltergeist,162," We're going down! Brace for impact! [Everyone screams and boat collapses to the ground]
",8
19455,Flying Dutchman,162," Don't go anywhere, kiddies! Cause you're about to be cursed like you've never been cursed before!
",8
19456,SpongeBob,162," Uh-oh. I don't like the sound of that!
",8
19457,Flying Dutchman,162," Observe! [Dutchman takes out his eyeball and transforms into a missile, launching himself at the Poltergeist's ship] Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! [Missile destroys the ship] Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

19458,Lord Poltergeist,162," Welcome to the Kursed Krab! How may we serve you this eternity?
",8
19459,Skeleton,162," I just need to use the bathroom!
",8
19460,Lord Poltergeist,162," Aargh, it's right over there.

19461,Patrick,162," Here's your milkshake, Sandy. [Gremlin pops out of the milkshake]

19462,Sandy,162," Got ya, you little gremlin!

19463,Doughnut,162," And what would you like, sir?
",8
19464,Ghost,162," I want a plain doughnut! [Eats doughnut off Patrick's head, to which he is given a bill]

19465,Mr. Krabs,162," How's the holdup, Mr. Squidward?
",8
19466,Squidward,162," Everyone's paying with bones.
",8
19467,Mr. Krabs,162," Well, money's money!
",8
19468,Squidward,162," No, I mean actual bones.
",8
19469,Mr. Krabs,162," Hmm. Those must be worth something down here.

",8
19507,SpongeBob,163," Hang on a minute, Patrick, we've got Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy standing right over here!
",8
19508,Patrick,163," ...Yeah, so?
",8
19509,SpongeBob,163," So, if we want to hear their origin, why don't we just ask them?
",8
19510,Patrick,163," Whoa! You're like a brain professor!
",8
19511,SpongeBob,163," Mermaid Man, Barnacle Boy, we wanna know how this all started.
",8
19512,Mermaid Man,163," You wanna go back to the start of it all, eh? Well, you see, in the beginning, it was all dark. And then all of a sudden, an event called The Big Splash formed the seas, and-
",8
19513,Barnacle Boy,163," Not the beginning of time, Mermaid-Brain. They want to know how we became a crime-fighting duo.
",8
19514,Mermaid Man,163," Oh... right. [thinking] Well, it all started when I was just a young, handsome muscular lad, [A flashback begins, showing a young, handsome Mermaid Man surfing and eating a submarine sandwich] when suddenly, I noticed that my washing machine had stopped. [Mermaid Man of the flashback grabs the clothes out of the washing machine on the beach]
",8
19515,Barnacle Boy,163," What are you talking about? [flashback ends]
",8
19516,Mermaid Man,163," Huh?
",8
19517,Barnacle Boy,163," You're supposed to be telling the story of how we became superheroes!
",8
19518,Mermaid Man,163," [slaps forehead] ...The story. Yes. I was a young, handsome muscular lad, soaking up the sun's rays on the beach, [a new flashback begins, very similar to the first one] when suddenly I became drowsy. [Mermaid Man in the flashback falls asleep instantly] A wave came ashore, and drew me back into the ocean! [waves draw Mermaid Man in the flashback into the sea, he is drowning, and he yells ""Help!"" while coughing] Suddenly, I realized I was being sucked under by a violent whirlpool! I was running out of oxygen fast. [Mermaid Man in the flashback sinks to the bottom of the sea and gives up trying the struggle] But before I drowned, I was rescued by mermaids. [Mermaid Man in the flashback is carried through the ocean by two mermaids] They took me to the ocean floor, where they gave me a magic sea star that allowed me to breathe underwater. [Mermaid Man in the flashback inhales and exhales deeply, then falls asleep, the present Mermaid Man falls asleep also]
",8
19519,Barnacle Boy,163," Wake up, you old coot. Finish the story.
",8
19520,Mermaid Man,163," [wakes up after being nudged by Barnacle Boy] Huh?
",8
19521,SpongeBob,163," [excitedly] Yeah, Mermaid Man, what about Barnacle Boy?
",8
19522,Patrick,163," Yeah, how'd you two meet?
",8
19523,Mermaid Man,163," [slapping his temples] Oh, sorry boys... There I was in the ocean, the only human who could breathe underwater. [flashback resumes] Alas, such a life got lonely real fast; I had no other humans to talk to. What was a man to do? Then my question was answered. [the bottom of a boat is seen in the flashback, then the port side of the boat is shown, where a very young Barnacle Boy is scraping barnacles off the wood. The captain of the boat appears]
",8
19524,Captain,163," Hey, barnacle boy, make sure you scrape the barnacles underneath, too.
",8
19525,Young Barnacle Boy,163," Aye, aye. [he takes a deep breath and lowers himself underwater to get the barnacles under the surface]
",8
19526,Flashback Mermaid Man,163," A boy in trouble! I've got to act fast or he'll drown. [he swims to Barnacle Boy] Fear not, young man. I'll take care of this.
",8
19527,Mermaid Man,163," [narrating once again] I used my new telekinetic powers to draw barnacles into Barnacle Boy's body, where they took the place of his lungs so he could breathe underwater, too. It was at that moment when we decided to team up.
",8
19528,SpongeBob,163," [the flashback has ended] Ohhhh, so that's how you guys got together.
",8
19529,Barnacle Boy,163," No, no, no... [shaking head and crossing arms] the reason I teamed up with this joker is because I was stuck breathing underwater for the rest of my life.
",8
19530,Mermaid Man,163," Oh... yeah.
",8
19531,Barnacle Boy,163," Anyway, from that day forward, we became
",8
19532,Johnny,163," Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, superhero crime fighters!
",8
19533,Flashback Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy,163," [new flashback begins, an alarm is clanging while people are shouting] A crime in progress! [A bank robber laughs maniacally as he is stealing bags of cash from the First Nautical Bank]
",8
19534,Banker,163," Stop! Thief!
",8
19535,Flashback Barnacle Boy,163," See if you think this is funny, evildoer. [He rapidly spits barnacles at the robber, knocking him down] Who's laughing now, thieving scum?
",8
19536,Banker,163," [shaking Mermaid Man's hand] Thank you, sir. And to whom do I owe this debt of gratitude?
",8
19537,Flashback Mermaid Man,163," You can thank me, Mermaid Man. [Barnacle Boy is seen shaking in indignity in the background]
",8
19538,Man Ray,163," [new flashback begins, Man Ray has the upper hand in a duel against Barnacle Boy. He laughs] You're mine!
",8
19539,Flashback Barnacle Boy,163," [shoots web a web of cheese-like material that binds and gags Man Ray] How'd you like to taste my tentacle zapper, Man Ray?
",8
19540,Flashback Mermaid Man,163," [dialing a pay phone] Hello... [indistinct response] So? What are you wearing? [indistinct response] Oh. In that case, can I get a large pepperoni pizza, extra cheese? Thanks. [Barnacle Boy slaps his head in disgust]
",8
19541,Mermaid Man,163," [flashback has ended] That didn't happen!
",8
19542,Barnacle Boy,163," Oh yes it did!
",8

",8
19544,Barnacle Boy,163," Oh, ha ha, lot you remember. You don't even remember where you live.
",8
19545,Mermaid Man,163," It didn't happen!
",8
19546,Johnny,163," [the Mermalair's large TV suddenly turns on] And now, without any further delays, the Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Origin Episode.
",8
19547,SpongeBob,163," [standing up excitedly] Oh, this is it!
",8
19548,Johnny,163," The story of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy all started here. [The TV zooms in on a series of red apartment buildings]
",8
19549,Tim,163," [Barnacle Boy is now a young adult dressed in a white t-shirt and jeans, in front of the television sitting on a couch] Come on, Ernie! The movie's about to start... Where's the popcorn?
",8
19550,Ernie,163," [Mermaid Man is now a young adult dressed in a striped shirt and khakis. He is waiting next to the microwave in the kitchen] It's in the microwave, Tim.
",8
19551,Ernie,163," Hey, the popcorn's ready!
",8
19552,Johnny,163," ...they proceed with movie night and eat slightly overcooked popcorn.
",8
19553,Tim,163," Mmmm... I think you overcooked this a little.
",8
19554,Johnny,163," Suddenly, an amazing reaction to the overcooked popcorn hits them with a jolt of cosmic super energy, metamorphosing Ernie into an incredibly strong, seastar-wearing superhero and Tim into a slightly less strong, but also super sailor-looking guy.
",8
19555,Tim,163," I have the sudden and incredibly urge to breathe water instead of air.
",8
19556,Ernie,163," As do I.
",8
19557,Barnacle Boy,163," Oh, feels just like yesterday, doesn't it, Mermaid Man?
",8
19558,Mermaid Man,163," ...No, not really.
",8
19559,Barnacle Boy,163," Hmm... Oh, so what do you boys think? Boys? [realizes SpongeBob and Patrick have left]
",8
19560,SpongeBob,163," [programming microwave for 12 minutes] Okay, Patrick, the overcooked popcorn will be ready in twelve minutes!
",8
19561,Patrick,163," This is gonna be so super awesome!
",8
19562,SpongeBob,163," So superhero awesome!
",8
19563,Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy,163, No! Stop! But you're not superhero material! Look at those shoes![Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy keep on blabbering until the episode ends],8

19571,Pearl's friend,164," [laughing] Speaking of remembering, you didn't forget the Bikini Bottom High School Dance is tomorrow night, did you?
",8

19586,Mr. Krabs,164," Good point.
",8
19587,Mr. Krabs,164," Pearl, what brings you in on such a fine afternoon?
",8
19588,Pearl,164," Oh, Daddy! It's terrible. The school dance is this weekend.
",8
19589,Mr. Krabs,164," Oooh, that is terrible. [he shivers] Makes my shell crawl just thinking about it. Bleugh!
",8
19590,Pearl,164," No, daddy! Don't you understand?! The terrible part is that I can't go to the dance!
",8
19591,Mr. Krabs,164," [comes closer] Why ever not?
",8
19592,Pearl,164," Because I have a hideous barnacle growing on the side of my face!
",8
19593,Mr. Krabs,164," Oh-ho-ho-ho. Now, calm down there, my little Pearl. I'm sure it can't be half as awful as you... [pus is shown oozing out of the barnacle; Krabs screams Great rusty hinges of Davy Jones' Locker!
",8
19594,Pearl,164," We have to get rid of it, no matter what it takes!
",8
19595,Pearl,164," Oh, okay. I need an appointment with a dermatologist, a trip to the spa, expensive creams and lotions, and probably some other kind of... [Krabs stops her, angrily]
",8
19596,Mr. Krabs,164," I meant whatever you need to get rid of your blemish, not liquidate me retirement fund. [this causes Pearl to cry again, soaking a table Harold and Nat are having lunch at]

19597,Harold,164," You know what? Let's go across the street to the Chum Bucket.

19598,Nat,164," I heard they have better weather over there. [They leave the Krusty Krab]

19600,Mr. Krabs,164," Oh, SpongeBob. [SpongeBob stops] How would you like to... [He salutes] Ease it!  [SpongeBob drops his hand] How would you like to do your dear old chum a favor and raid this beautiful daughter of her evil barnacle?
",8
19601,SpongeBob,164," I will do you this favor, sir chum, never fear!
",8
19602,Pearl,164," I don't know, SpongeBob. The school dance is right around the corner, and this barnacle seems to be getting bigger by the minute!
",8
19603,SpongeBob,164," Don't fear, Pearl. We'll get rid of this barnacle in no time! I know just what to do!
",8
19604,Pearl,164," Are you sure?
",8
19605,SpongeBob,164," One time, my friend Patrick had this barnacle the size of an extra large Krabby Patty right at the center of his forehead! Anyway, I fixed it so we never saw that barnacle again.
",8
19606,Pearl,164," How?
",8
19607,SpongeBob,164," I took him to see a hypnotist.
",8
19608,Pearl,164," You took Patrick to a hypnotist?
",8
19609,SpongeBob,164," No. The barnacle. It became convinced it was a pelican and flew south for the winter. We never saw that pelican again.
",8
19610,Pearl,164," I thought you said it was a barnacle.
",8
19611,SpongeBob,164," What did I say?
",8
19612,Pearl,164," Pelican.
",8
19613,SpongeBob,164," [pauses for a second] He was a really good hypnotist.
",8
19614,SpongeBob,164," Now just remain calm and it's all over before you know it.
",8
19615,Pearl,164," Are you really going to use hypnosis to get rid of the... barnacle?
",8
19616,SpongeBob,164," [laughing] Hypnosis? No! Hold still now. [hits the barnacle]
",8
19617,Pearl,164," Is everything okay?
",8
19618,SpongeBob,164," [shows broken spatula] I don't think this is going to work. [Brings in a shovel] This ol' shovel is gonna do the work! [hits the barnacle]
",8
19619,Pearl,164," Did it come off?
",8
19620,SpongeBob,164," [the shovel is stuck in his head] Gettin' there.
",8
19621,Pearl,164," SpongeBob, how much longer?
",8
19622,SpongeBob,164," Oh... shouldn't be too much longer. [the jackhammer disintegrates] Personally, you could take a break off if you'd like.
",8
19623,Pearl,164," Good idea. I'm going to scrub my face with some soap and water.
",8
19624,SpongeBob,164," Okay. [he throws the jackhammer aside, which lands in a pile of other broken tools]
",8
19625,SpongeBob,164," [walks into the bathroom] Pearl! [Pearl is seen with soap covering her face] Pearl, what happened?
",8
19626,Pearl,164," There's more! [the soap slides off her face, exposing lots of barnacles everywhere]
",8
19627,SpongeBob,164," [shrieks] I mean, you're right. There's more.
",8
19628,Pearl,164," [puzzled] All I did was wash with soap and water!
",8
19629,SpongeBob,164," [examines the soap] Hmm... Water and... this soap?
",8
19630,Pearl,164," Yes, but why?
",8
19631,SpongeBob,164," [sniffs the bar of soap] Because this soap smells so wonderful! That's why. Hmm, I know this fragrance from somewhere. [keeps sniffing the soap] Oh, I'm sorry, did you want a whiff?
",8
19632,Pearl,164," No.
",8
19633,SpongeBob,164," [continues sniffing] More for me!
",8
19634,SpongeBob,164," [holding the jar of cream] No, I think one jar of concealing cream is enough. Don't worry, Pearl, no one will notice a thing. [Mr. Krabs enters the house with the groceries]
",8
19635,Mr. Krabs,164," [humming] Pearl, I'm home! [screams loudly]
",8
19636,SpongeBob,164," Something wrong, Mr. Krabs?
",8
19637,Mr. Krabs,164," For a second there, I thought a towering, hideous, mind-boggling abomination was standing here, staring at me in my own living room! But then I realized... [sweetly] it's only my old, beloved daughter, Pearl. [Pearl mumbles again] Oh, Pearl. No, no, no need for these expensive trips to the spa. But don't worry, SpongeBob here will take care of it. I have more important measures to take care of. [Mr. Krabs walks over to a safe full of diamonds and jumps in] Me jewwweells!
",8
19638,SpongeBob,164," Pearl? [knocks on the bathroom door] Pearl, you've been in the bathroom crying for three hours now. You can't stay in there forever.
",8
19639,Pearl,164," [from inside] I'm not going to the dance!
",8
19640,SpongeBob,164," Okay, I'm coming in! [opens the door, which causes a flood of tears to gush out into the hallway. SpongeBob swims against the current and makes it in] Look at the bright side, Pearl. At least you can still play the piano.
",8
19641,Pearl,164," And what exactly would that do to me?
",8
19642,SpongeBob,164," I have no idea. [Pearl bawls] Don't worry, Pearl. I'll fix your crying!
",8
19643,Pearl,164," How?
",8
19644,SpongeBob,164," Well, I'm sure if I'll think strong enough, something will pop up. [something DOES pop up, and it's more barnacles] Oops, I didn't mean it like that. [sees the bar of soap and picks it up] Hey, it's that delicious-smelling soap again. [starts sniffing the soap again]
",8
19645,Pearl,164," [snatches it away]
",8
19646,SpongeBob,164," Okay. Where do you keep your soap?
",8
19647,Pearl,164," In the basement. Duh, where else? [scrubs her face more]
",8
19648,SpongeBob,164," [echoes] Hello? [SpongeBob jumps when he hears the echo, but keeps going until he hears another noise and turns around] Something there? Pearl?! [His torch goes out, making it completely dark. SpongeBob sees a door opening and goes through it to find Mr. Krabs, trying to pull a stuck handle] Mr. Krabs!
",8
19649,Mr. Krabs,164," Don't just stand there, boy! Come help me with this! [they both pull at the handle until it moves] There we go. Sometimes it just gets a little stuck.
",8
19650,SpongeBob,164," Mr. Krabs, what is this thing?
",8
19651,Mr. Krabs,164," Why, it's my old soap press!
",8
19652,SpongeBob,164," Soap press?
",8
19653,Mr. Krabs,164," That's right! All the soap Pearl and I use comes from this machine. And the best part is, it runs on 100% pure leftover Krabby Patties!
",8
19654,SpongeBob,164," Leftover Krabby Patties?
",8
19655,Mr. Krabs,164," [tosses a Krabby Patty into the machine] Their precious essences are harvested, and after a brief cooling process, tumble out this conveyor belt as fresh, wonderful bars of soap! [the new soap falls off the conveyor belt into a basket] Fresh and invigorating! Plus, it's absolutely free.
",8
19656,SpongeBob,164," [picks up one of the soap bars and sniffs it] Ohhhh, that explains why it smells so familiar! I don't know about this, Mr. Krabs. If Pearl finds out that you...
",8
19657,Pearl,164," [lividly] I've been using soap made out of KRABBY PATTIES?!
",8
19658,Mr. Krabs,164," Krabby Patty essence.
",8
19659,Pearl,164," That's GREASE!
",8
19660,Mr. Krabs,164," Well, if you want to split hairs, I suppose--
",8
19661,Pearl,164," [furiously] DADDYYYYY! [throws soap at her father]
",8
19662,Mr. Krabs,164," [runs away in fear] Got to go, keep your cellphone!
",8
19663,Pearl,164," [bursts into tears and rubs her eyes making squeaky sounds] I'm never gonna be able to get these barnacles off! My young life is ruined forever.
",8
19664,SpongeBob,164," Don't worry, Pearl. I said I'm not going to let Mr. Krabs down, and I'm not going to. What do you think of that?
",8
19665,Pearl,164," [wails] The Bikini Bottom High School Dance was supposed to be my chance to sparkle, my--
",8
19666,SpongeBob,164," Wait a minute, Pearl, say that again!
",8
19667,Pearl,164," Okay. The Bikini Bottom High School Dance was supposed to be my chance to sparkle.
",8
19668,SpongeBob,164," Okay, you can stop. I think I have an idea...
",8
19669,Pearl,164," Are you done yet?
",8
19670,SpongeBob,164," [climbs down the ladder] All set! Close your eyes and get ready to sparkle! One, two, three. [turns Pearl's chair to face the mirror. Pearl has blue diamonds on her face to hide her barnacles] Ta-da! What do you think?
",8
19671,Pearl,164," I don't know, SpongeBob -- what would my friends say?
",8
19672,SpongeBob,164," [walks her to the living room] We shall see shortly.
",8
19673,Pearl,164," Are you sure?
",8
19674,SpongeBob,164," [opens the front door] Shh. Trust me.
",8
19675,Blue fish,164," Pearl, we're here to pick you up to the-- wow! Pearl, you look amazing!
",8
19676,Pearl,164," I do?
",8
19677,Blue fish,164," Well, not amazing. Sparkly and shiny and amazing!
",8
19678,Pearl,164," Whee! To the Bikini Bottom High School Dance!
",8
19679,Pearl and her friends,164," [laughing] Let's go! [they run out of the house, and SpongeBob shuts the door behind them]
",8
19680,SpongeBob,164," You have a good time, carefree teens!
",8
19681,Mr. Krabs,164," [screams and exits his jewel safe] My jewels! SpongeBob, my entire collection of precious jewels is gone! Seen it?
",8
19682,SpongeBob,164," Of course! Pearl's wearing it to the Bikini Bottom High School Dance!
",8
19683,Mr. Krabs,164," Help! Police! Thief! [runs out of the house, running through the door] Stop that whale!
",8
19684,SpongeBob,164," I promised Mr. Krabs I wouldn't let him down, and I have partially fulfilled that promise.",8

",8
19704,SpongeBob,165," Uh-huh.
",8
19705,Sandy,165," Here's a comprehensive list of ""do""s and ""don't""s to follow. [gives SpongeBob the list]
",8

",8
19707,Sandy,165," [chuckles] That's to save paper. You'll need this special reading scope. [holds up the reading scope. SpongeBob takes it from her. He looks through it and sees the list clearer with lots of don't's]
",8
19708,SpongeBob,165," Oh.
",8
19709,Sandy,165," Now pay attention as I clue you in on some of your more elaborate responsibilities. This majestic structure is my kelp greenhouse. Its functions are complete automated, so all you have to do...
",8
19710,SpongeBob,165," Wow...!
",8
19711,Sandy,165," ...is check this thermometer right here and make sure the temperature is normal. [SpongeBob takes down notes]

19712,SpongeBob,165," ""Nor... mal."" Got it. [him and Sandy are at a garage door opening] 
",8
19713,Sandy,165," And this is the robot warehouse. It's where I keep all my robots.
",8
19714,SpongeBob,165," That stands to reason.
",8
19715,Sandy,165," This part's easy. All's you gotta do is come in here and count every single one of these robots and make sure none of them's gone missing. [SpongeBob takes down notes again. Scene cuts to him and Sandy walking] You seem to be doing a good job paying attention, SpongeBob.
",8
19716,SpongeBob,165," I respect your meticulous nature.

19719,Sandy,165," This here is my worm incubator. They're not set to hatch for weeks, but I just thought I'd show it to you anyway. [SpongeBob takes down notes again. Scene cuts to him and Sandy at a shelf] And last but not least is my collection of rare and fragile artifacts that has to be cleaned twice daily. Now are you sure you can handle all that, SpongeBob?
",8
19720,SpongeBob,165," Trust me, Sandy. You've got nothing to worry about. Your beloved treedome is in my capable hands.
",8

",8
19724,SpongeBob,165," Really sure.
",8
19725,Sandy,165," Okay. [Scene cuts to her going on her bus to Texas. The bus drives away. SpongeBob looks at the list and goes into the kelp greenhouse. He closes the door. He checks the temperature]
",8
19726,SpongeBob,165," [taking down notes] Normal. [he then goes in the robot warehouse. He is counting the robots] 2,692... [He is wearing a hat. He types the something down on a gadget. The gadget takes out some paper with the words on it] 2,693... [types something again and the gadget takes out more paper] 2,694... [types something again but he types to much causing the gadget to take out lots of paper. He starts laughing. Suddenly, the gadget goes on fire and so does the paper then it disintegrates. SpongeBob leaves. Scene cuts to him wearing a dress while dusting Sandy's artifacts] Sandy said this collection of rare fragile artifacts needs to be gently cleaned twice daily. There we go. Not a speck of dust anywhere. Wait a minute. [turns a skull head around and spots a dot on it] Aha! [takes a feather off the duster and dusts the dot off] There... we go. [Scene cuts to SpongeBob checking the worm incubator] Worm incubator. Well, looks like everything's fine here. [there is a squishing sound] What the...? [a worm starts to hatch] Ohhh!! Sandy said these wouldn't hatch for... [checks the list] ...weeks! What is going on?! [Patrick's head pops up] Oh! Patrick? [Patrick pops out of the hole wearing his helmet]
",8
19727,Patrick,165," SpongeBob! There you are!
",8
19728,SpongeBob,165," Oh, what a relief. I thought you were a horrible mutant worm who was about to soak me with digestive juices and slowly consume me over a period of weeks.
",8
19729,Patrick,165," Nah, no, thanks. I had a late breakfast.
",8
19730,SpongeBob,165," Why are you wearing that funny thing on your head?
",8
19731,Patrick,165," Well, because we can't breathe in Sandy's treedome, remember? It's filled with air.
",8
19732,SpongeBob,165," Oh, yeah, thanks for reminding me. I almost for... [dries up and starts gasping for water] P-P-P-Patrick! Help me! I-I can't b-b-b-breathe! [Patrick puts a water helmet on SpongeBob's head]
",8
19733,Patrick,165," There you go. [SpongeBob inhales and exhales] 
",8
19734,SpongeBob,165," Thanks, Patrick. You're a life-saver. Now that I haven't suffocated, it's high time I got back to this list of house-sitting duties. So without further ado, Patrick, [opens the door] I'd like you to please immediately exit the treedome.
",8

19737,Patrick,165," Oh, SpongeBob, that's a great idea! Where should we go—Jellyfish Fields, Goo Lagoon, Barg'N-Mart, Lucky Larry's?
",8
19738,SpongeBob,165," Well, Lucky Larry's sounds fun.
",8
19739,Patrick,165," All right, let's go!
",8
19740,SpongeBob,165," Hold it! I promised Sandy I'd take extra-special care of her treedome while she's at the Inventor's Convention today. And that is exactly what I intend to do. Patrick, this is a major responsibility.
",8
19741,Patrick,165," Well, in that case, I'd better stay and help you.
",8
19742,SpongeBob,165," Nnnnope.

19743,Patrick,165," Pleeease?

19744,SpongeBob,165," Not gonna happen.

19745,Patrick,165," Pretty please?

19746,SpongeBob,165," No way.
",8
19747,Patrick,165," Pretty please with a scoop of vanilla ice cream?
",8
19748,SpongeBob,165," [scoffs] Yeah, right.
",8
19749,Patrick,165," Pretty please with a scoop of strawberry, vanilla, and chocolate ice cream, smothered in gooberberry sauce and topped with half a can of whipped topping?
",8
19750,SpongeBob,165," Patrick, what do you take me for?
",8
19751,Patrick,165," AND A SCOOP OF NUTS!!
",8
19752,SpongeBob,165," Deal.
",8
19753,Patrick,165," [jumps with joy] Hooray!
",8
19754,SpongeBob,165," But you have to promise not to touch anything.
",8
19755,Patrick,165," [raises his left hand] I, Patrick Star, hereby promise not to touch anything.
",8
19756,SpongeBob,165," Okay. Now, let's check the list to see what's nex... [alarmed] PATRICK! [Patrick is chomping on Sandy's artifact shelf. SpongeBob runs over to him] Patrick, no!! You promised me you weren't gonna touch anything.
",8
19757,Patrick,165," [pits water helment back on] I wasn't touching anything!
",8
19758,SpongeBob,165," Then what were you just doing to Sandy's collection of rare and fragile artifacts?!
",8
19759,Patrick,165," Um... Tasting it.
",8
19760,SpongeBob,165," Okay, Patrick, I insist. From now on, you must stick to me as closely as possible. Do I make myself perfectly clear? [Patrick doesn't answer] Patrick, I said, do I make myself perf... Patrick! Patrick? [turns to see 'Patrick sitting on his back]
",8
19761,Patrick,165," Is this close enough?
",8
19762,SpongeBob,165," Okay, Patrick, tell me again what it is you're gonna do.
",8
19763,Patrick,165," Not... touch anything.
",8
19764,SpongeBob,165," Mm-hmm. What else.
",8
19765,Patrick,165," Not do anything.
",8
19766,SpongeBob,165," And
",8
19767,Patrick,165," Not... look at anything.
",8
19768,SpongeBob,165," Until when? Until...?
",8
19769,Patrick,165," Until... SpongeBob is done house sitting.
",8
19770,SpongeBob,165," [pats Patrick's head] Good boy, Patrick!
",8
19771,SpongeBob,165," Patrick how many times do I have to---
",8
19772,Patrick,165," It wasn't me!
",8
19773,SpongeBob,165," Well I I guess I can't handle it after all I I'm a failure. (SpongeBob cries)
",8
19774,Patrick,165," Hey buddy, it's not as bad as it seems.
",8
19775,SpongeBob,165," Oh yeah, what makes you say that?
",8
19776,Patrick,165," Well, not everything is broken.
",8
19777,SpongeBob,165," (cries until Sandy came back) (gasps) Sa..S...S..San....Sandy? (Sandy walks in shocked by the destruction) How was the inventors convention?
",8
19778,Patrick,165," Did you bring back any souvenirs?
",8
19779,Sandy,165," Funny, y'all should ask that.
",8
19780,SpongeBob,165," It is?
",8
19781,Sandy,165," Yep. I brought home something real handy.
",8
19782,SpongeBob and Patrick,165," (gasps)

19783,Sandy,165," And i'm setting it to maximum power.

19786,Sandy,165," Eureka, it worked! The experiment is a success.
",8
19787,SpongeBob and Patrick,165," Experiment?
",8
19788,Sandy,165," That's right boys. I wanted you to destroy my home all along so I can test this out this here rubble reverse ray blaster on some genuine rubble. I could've just smashed all this stuff up myself, but nobody destroys stuff up quite like y'all. You're not a failure SpongeBob, you're a scientist. (SpongeBob and Patrick laughing)

19790,SpongeBob,165," Hooray!

",8
19794,Robot,165," Ha, ha, ha!
",8
19795,SpongeBob,165," Silly old robot. He doesn't realize you have more than one of these ray guns. Isn't that right Sandy? You do have more than one them? Don't you Sandy? (Sandy doesn't answer)  Sandy? (gulps)

[shows Sandy with Fuzzy Acorns] Sandy is in trouble, don't worry, Sandy, I'm coming to save you! [flies then digs to Sandy's Treedome but is stopped by Fuzzy Acorn's stinky feet.]
",8
19804,Fuzzy Acorns,166," Who is this intruder that fails to attack me?
",8
19805,SpongeBob,166," Woah...what was that stench?
",8
19806,Fuzzy Acorns,166," That is what we in karate call The Smell of Death!
",8
19807,SpongeBob,166," [gets up] You know kah-ra-tay?
",8
19808,Sandy,166," He just doesn't know karate, he IS karate. [Fuzzy Acorns takes down a fly using his eyebrows] He is the legendary karate master, Fuzzy Acorns. Fuzzy is here to test me for the highest belt in karate.
",8
19809,SpongeBob,166," But Sandy, you already have a black belt.
",8
19810,Sandy,166," Yes but there's one even higher than that! [points to Fuzzy Acorns' belt] The blacker belt!
",8
19811,SpongeBob,166," Gee...I wish I had a karate belt
",8
19812,Fuzzy Acorns,166," [quickly moves beside SpongeBob] If you want a belt, you must earn it.
",8
19813,SpongeBob,166," Okay? How do I do that?
",8
19814,Fuzzy Acorns,166," You got caught in the eyes? What do you think I'm here for!?
",8
19815,SpongeBob,166," Hm?
",8
19816,Fuzzy Acorns,166," I am the mighty oak, and you are but a sapling!
",8
19817,SpongeBob,166," Um...sorry. I'm confused.
",8
19818,Fuzzy Acorns,166," I am here to separate that wheat from the chaff! No? [SpongeBob shakes his head] That last one usually works...
",8
19819,Sandy,166," What Fuzzy is trying to say is that he is here to judge whether anyone is worthy of getting a karate belt or not.
",8
19820,SpongeBob,166," But how can anyone ever truly know whether he or she is worthy?
",8
19821,Fuzzy Acorns,166," It is simple. I conduct a series of tests, and if you pass, [takes out a red belt] I'll give you a belt that shows you know karate.
",8
19822,Fuzzy Acorns,166," The first test is simple. Split a log with one hand chop, like so. [easily chops the log in half] Your turn, [places another log down] Karate Man.
",8
19823,SpongeBob,166," [walks over to the log] Mm-mmm! Yeah, okay.
",8
19824,Fuzzy Acorns,166," Please proceed.
",8
19825,SpongeBob,166," Okay! Prepare to see the split of your life! [jumps onto the log but ends up splitting himself in half]
",8
19826,Fuzzy Acorns,166," Mastery of this test will show me you're ready for the next level of karate-dom! [shouts while swinging the stick around] Alright, your turn! [gives SpongeBob the stick]
",8
19827,SpongeBob,166," In turn I will! [laughs]
",8
19828,Fuzzy Acorns,166," Just do the thing with the thing please! [SpongeBob jumps onto Sandy's wheel and starts to ride around on it while Nat Peterson is seen playing a piano and SpongeBob runs into Sandy] We shall settle this on the battlefield tomorrow! You two will fight each other! If I see you have the skill of real hand-to-hand combat, I will award you with karate belts. [takes out two karate belts then puts them back] Otherwise, you get nothing. [jumps up into the tree]
",8
19829,SpongeBob,166," Oh, wait! Sensei!
",8
19830,Fuzzy Acorns,166," No more talk! Only do!
",8
19831,Sandy,166," [leads SpongeBob out of her tree dome] Better run on home and practice SpongeBob! See you tomorrow! [closes the door]

19838,SpongeBob,166," Here...I'm right here...[has a tired expression on his face] I've readied myself...into a full state of readiness...and I am ready...to be ready...I'm so tired...I'm so tired...so very tired...
",8
19839,Sandy,166," You sure you want to do this buddy?
",8
19840,Fuzzy Acorns,166," Enough talk! If you want your belt, you gonna have to tussle it out! So let the match begin!!!
",8
19841,SpongeBob,166," Alright! Brace yourself Sandy! 'Cause it's about to get rough and tumble!
",8
19842,Sandy,166," [quickly moving behind and in front of SpongeBob] Okay, SpongeBob! You gotta catch me first! [SpongeBob starts to spin around and she forces him into the ground]
",8
19843,Fuzzy Acorns,166," Most impressive, Sandy. But I am here to evaluate SpongeBob. [grabs SpongeBob with his foot] Let's see what he can do on the offensive! [tosses SpongeBob toward Sandy but she grabs him in midair and tosses him into a tree]
",8
19844,SpongeBob,166," Okay Sandy! [karate chops a picnic table and jumps onto the wooden pieces close to Sandy] Prepare for my finishing move! I call it The Sleeper! [falls asleep on the table]
",8
19845,Sandy,166," Huh?
",8
19846,Fuzzy Acorns,166," Very good, Sandy! You put your opponent to sleep in under a minute! [touches the table and it falls apart causing SpongeBob to wake up] Too bad your opponent didn't put up a fight. I was prepared to give you the lowest of belts, [takes out a transparent belt] The Clear Belt! [chuckles] But now I realize you're unfit to wear a belt of any kind, INCLUDING THE ONE THAT HOLDS UP YOUR PANTS!!! [takes off SpongeBob's belt which causes his pants to fall down]
",8
19847,Sandy,166," Don't be disappointed, SpongeBob. A belt isn't the most important thing in karate.
",8
19848,SpongeBob,166," Easy for you to say Sandy. Your pants aren't down right around your ankles.
",8
19849,Fuzzy Acorns,166," [takes Sandy's black belt] And I'm revoking your black belt!
",8
19850,Sandy,166," Hey! You can't do that!
",8
19851,Fuzzy Acorns,166," Oh yes I can! For wasting my time bringing me this sorry, EXCUSE FOR A STUDENT!!! Stick to something you're good at son.
",8
19852,SpongeBob,166," Yes Sensei...[walks off sadly]
",8
19853,Sandy,166," That was pretty low-down, Fuzzy. The way you humiliated my friend.
",8
19854,Fuzzy Acorns,166," The Sponge-One will never earn his belt.
",8
19855,Sandy,166," I know SpongeBob will impress you if you give him one more chance!
",8
19856,Fuzzy Acorns,166," Silence! No more chances! Sensei never gives two chances! If you really want to impress me, show me where I can get a decent meal around here. Lunch time approaches.
",8
19857,Sandy,166," That's it! I'll take him to the Krusty Krab and then he might just find himself impressed by a certain sandwich maker!
",8
19858,Fuzzy Acorns,166," Who're you talking to?
",8
19859,Squidward,166," Come on, SpongeBob! What's wrong with you!? Get grilling!
",8
19860,SpongeBob,166," Squidward I...I failed my karate exam...
",8
19861,SpongeBob,166," Stick to what I'm good at? Hey, Squidward's right! [quickly and easily makes Krabby Patties together. Sandy and Fuzzy Acorns are seen at a table]
",8
19862,Sandy,166," You sure you don't need an air helmet?
",8
19863,Fuzzy Acorns,166," This won't take long. Fuzzy has trained himself to go hours without air. [SpongeBob is seen jumping through the air throwing Krabby Patties to customers]
",8
19864,Sandy,166," How about them moves?
",8
19865,Fuzzy Acorns,166," Pretty okay...for a fry cook!
",8
19866,Squidward,166," SpongeBob! Twenty more orders here!
",8
19867,SpongeBob,166," Twenty! Got it Squidward! [flings more Krabby Patties to customers then jumps back into the kitchen]
",8
19868,Sandy,166," Well, that took some agility!
",8
19869,Fuzzy Acorns,166," Simple parlor tricks! [SpongeBob then kicks a Krabby Patty toward Frank] Yah, a Kung-Fu charlatan! [SpongeBob spins around and delivers Krabby Patties to Sandy and Fuzzy Acorns]
",8
19870,Sandy,166," Now you're convinced!
",8
19871,Fuzzy Acorns,166," I've seen better!
",8
19872,Sandy,166," Hey, SpongeBob! I like my Patty in twelfths please!
",8
19873,SpongeBob,166," Okay! [spins the Krabby Patty around and perfectly chops it into twelve equal pieces.]There you go Sandy!
",8
19874,Fuzzy Acorns,166," Huh!? May have Squishy boy is more skilled than I first thought!
",8
19875,Sandy,166," Told ya!
",8
19876,Fuzzy Acorns,166," Not so fast, Squirrel Cheeks! The only way to truly know is to test him myself! [puts on a headband and jumps toward SpongeBob but SpongeBob walks away and Fuzzy Acorns goes through a table]
",8
19877,Harold,166," Hey, waiter! An empty plate!?
",8
19878,SpongeBob,166," [Fuzzy Acorns screams and charges at SpongeBob but SpongeBob, not knowing, chops him in the face] Oh! I forgot the fries! [heads into the kitchen]
",8
19879,Fuzzy Acorns,166," [follows SpongeBob into the kitchen] Now, I see you're a skilled opponent! With a cold-blooded heart of a warrior!
",8
19880,SpongeBob,166," [holding a Krabby Patty while also not paying attention to Fuzzy Acorns] Sigh...You little Krabby Patties are so cute! Hmm...something's not right here. [sniffs the Krabby Patty] It's the onions! They've gone bad! [throws all the onions away with most of them hitting Fuzzy Acorns]
",8
19881,Fuzzy Acorns,166," He's on the offensive! [falls into a barrel of trash] Time for you to end this! [walks on the ceiling and falls onto SpongeBob but gets attacked while SpongeBob was cutting up more onions]
",8
19882,Sandy,166," That's showing him, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob dashes out as Fuzzy Acorns lands on the grill] You gonna give him a belt Fuzzy? Or have you not had enough yet?
",8
19883,Fuzzy Acorns,166," You brought me to the dance, but the universe is cutting in!
",8
19884,Sandy,166," Huh?
",8
19885,SpongeBob,166," [grilling Krabby Patties] Okay, looking good!
",8
19886,Fuzzy Acorns,166," Sponge-Man! [charges at SpongeBob] Smell the vibrations! [lands onto SpongeBob's body but gets tossed away]
",8
19887,SpongeBob,166," Make the fires! I almost forgot! [Fuzzy Acorns lands in a barrel of pickles]
",8
19888,Squidward,166," More Patties!
",8
19889,SpongeBob,166," Grilling them now! [puts more Patties on the grill and runs back to Harold and Debbie] Your fries, sir! [Fuzzy Acorns charges at SpongeBob once again and SpongeBob hands Frankie Billy fries] And your fries, sir! Ketchup? [drops the ketchup bottle] Oops! [bends down to pick it up and Fuzzy Acorns misses overhead and crashes] Got it! Gasp! Fuzzy!
",8
19890,Sandy,166," Oh no!
",8
19891,SpongeBob,166," Sensei Fuzzy! You okay?
",8
19892,Fuzzy Acorns,166," I was wrong about you SpongeBob. You have bested Fuzzy, with your karate greatness! [coughs and takes out a black belt] You are now a Karate Master!
",8
19893,SpongeBob,166," For me? Thanks Fuzzy! Fuzzy? You look terrible! [shows a close up of Fuzzy's horrific  face and he begins to behave strangely] Sandy, what's wrong with Fuzzy?
",8
19894,Sandy,166," I know what he needs! He just needs this![puts an air helmet on Fuzzy's head]
",8
19895,Fuzzy Acorns,166," No more talk, only do! Sandy my dear, for holding your own against The Sponge, you have truly proven yourself worthy of the Blacker Belt! [Sandy takes the blacker belt from him and she puts it around her suit]
",8
19896,Sandy and SpongeBob,166," Thanks Fuzzy! [watches as Fuzzy's pants fall down]
",8
19897,Fuzzy Acorns,166," Why must the universe confound me so!? [he, SpongeBob, Sandy, and the rest of the customers all share a laugh]",8

[Mr. Krabs pulls and a giant pile of sand hangs from his magnet] There's got to be a small fortune than discarded paperclips in there! [The sand falls only to reveal a second magnet. He then gets upset] I knew this place looked familiar. [Startles in surprise] What's this? Goodness, that must be Sandy's Treedome dwelling, and inside looks to be the largest soybean I have ever layed me eyestocks on. Now this bears getting a closer look. [He rings the door bell on Sandy's treedome and Sandy opens it in her air suit] Good afternoon, Miss Sandy.
",8
19905,Sandy,167," And good afternoon to you Mr. Krabs. What brings you out to this fine neck of the woods?
",8
19906,Mr. Krabs,167," Well uh, I just happen to be in the neighborhood and was wondering if you could see you in clear and grace me with a comprehensive tour of your homesweet treedome. [chuckles] I hear the giant soybean is lovely this time of the year.

",8
19910,Mr. Krabs,167," Seems so much bigger once your inside.
",8
19911,Sandy,167," That's what they all say. Did I already show you my single wheeled roller skate or my helicopter that is powered by coconut milk?
",8
19912,Mr. Krabs,167," Huh? Oh yeah, that sounds interesting Sandy, but uh actually...
",8
19913,Sandy,167," [walks over to her table and holds up a device that looks like a cube puzzle] Or my artificial intelligence that comes in the form of a multi-colored cubeshaped puzzle. See it can solve itself. [Zooms in to reveal that the Cube puzzle matches with the shapes on it]

19930,Mr. Krabs,167," Well, you did say it needs further testing. Test it on the krabby patty.

19931,Sandy,167," Well I suppose so. But only a single drop.

19932,Mr. Krabs,167," Fair enough. (Sandy puts a drop of growth serum into the krabby patty) Is it suppose to smell like that?

19937,Mr. Krabs,167," Eh, that patty didn't look like it's growing to me. Pfft, growth serum. Wasted a perfectly krabby patty would blemy.
",8
19938,SpongeBob,167," Mr. Krabs.
",8
19939,Mr. Krabs,167," Great, let's get into the Krusty Krab.
",8
19940,SpongeBob,167," Patty... Becoming... Awkward...
",8
19941,Mr. Krabs,167," Oh, here, here. (Brings out a grocery bag) Put it in this grocery bag.
",8
19942,SpongeBob,167," Grocery bag? Where'd you get a grocery bag?
",8
19943,Mr. Krabs,167," The grocery store.
",8
19944,SpongeBob,167," So, uh, how big's this thing suppose to get?
",8
19945,Mr. Krabs,167," Heh heh, who cares. It's an endless supply of free patties! And cook them fast, boy! (walks out the door) We got customers!
",8
19946,Squidward,167," (comes in from the post with an order) SpongeBob! Are you going to cook that thing or just stand there staring at it? (throws the order)
",8
19947,SpongeBob,167," Sorry Squidward. Coming right up! (runs to the stove grabbing the order) Order up, Squidward! (carrying a plate of piled up Krabby Patties)
",8
19948,Squidward,167," All right, keep them coming! (grabs the Krabby Patties)
",8
19949,SpongeBob,167," You betcha! (takes a scrap of patties from the big patty and put them on the stove. SpongeBob flips one of them as the big krabby patty grows even bigger behind SpongeBob)
",8
19950,SpongeBob,167," Oh my goodness! I almost forgot to flip that one. (he flips the krabby patty with a spatula) There we go. (brings out another pile of krabby patties and it bumps it behind Squidward's head.)
",8
19951,Squidward,167," Ok, that's great SpongeBob, but you don't have to knock me in the-  BAGEGAH! (gets surprised at the Krabby patty growing behind SpongeBob)
",8
19952,SpongeBob,167," Squidward, why did you make that weird noi- (He looks at the Patty and screams as it comes alive). Ahh! Easy boy. Easy. Never thought I'd say this but, I've gotta get out of this kitchen! (SpongeBob runs to the exit, but sees the grill eaten up) Nooooooo! Huh? (SpongeBob stares down as the krabby patty advances to his shoe. SpongeBob fights it off with his spatuala, but that gets eaten. SpongeBob screams then desperately yanks off his left shoe and sock, while the patty eats that up.) Squidward! That giant krabby patty is on a rampage! We have to escape!
",8
19953,Squidward,167," (Sees SpongeBob's bare foot) Do you always go barefoot at work, or have I just never noticed before?
",8
19954,SpongeBob,167," (pointing to his bare foot) Wouldn't this just count as half-barefoot? Squidward behind you! (SpongeBob points to growing patty, now destroying the Krusty Krab) Abandon ship! (Squidward screams as he and SpongeBob both flee).
",8
19955,Fish,167," [everyone runs out of the Krusty Krab] It's a Krabalanche! [SpongeBob and Squidward try to exit, but Mr. Krabs blocks their way.]
",8
19956,Mr. Krabs,167," Hold it! And just what is it you two think you're doing?
",8
19957,Squidward,167," The restaurant's being invaded by a 300 foot uncooked menu item. We're getting outta here!
",8
19958,Mr. Krabs,167," Whoa ho, this is a dream come true! You can't just leave!
",8
19959,Squidward,167," Oh, do you have a better idea?
",8
19960,Mr. Krabs,167," Stay?... And work?
",8
19961,Squidward,167," Okay, you go right ahead. But I'd rather stay alive than stay at work. That means you- [Squidward turns to see the cash register getting eaten by the Krabby Patty]
",8
19962,Mr. Krabs,167," Cashy! [Mr. Krabs runs over to the register.]
",8
19963,SpongeBob,167," Mr. Krabs, look out!
",8
19964,Mr. Krabs,167," Aaah! [Mr. Krabs is eaten by the Krabby Patty, which then proceeds to eat a table, a barrel chair and a column.]
",8
19965,Squidward,167," [To SpongeBob] I think it's our break time, don't you? [SpongeBob and Squidward run out of the Krusty Krab, screaming. The patty eats the Krusty Krab whole and chases them.]
",8
19966,Plankton,167," [watching the scene from the rooftop of the Chum Bucket with a telescope] What's this? [puts down the telescope] Krabs is cooking up some new scheme to undermine the success of his biggest competitor? ME?! [folds the telescope] Ah, I'd better get a closer look. [exits the Chum Bucket] [SpongeBob and Squidward are still running] Out of my way, you fools!
",8
19967,SpongeBob,167," [skids to a stop, while Squidward keeps running] Plankton, you're going the wrong way! Turn back or be crushed by a giant monster!
",8
19968,Plankton,167," [keeps running] I can't hear you! I need to see this! [Plankton skids and falls backwards] Holy mother of all creatures great and small! [The patty gets closer] It's the largest Krabby Patty the world has ever seen! It's... it's... gorgeous... [Plankton runs over to the patty, which gets closer] Oh, great patty! Take me! Take me home, daddy! [jumps into the patty]
",8
19969,Dale,167," [The Bikini Bottom citizens see the patty and start running away] Keep running, it's getting closer!
",8
19970,Fish,167," No, it isn't! Look! Where I'm pointing! It stopped!
",8
19971,Dale,167," [They stop running and look] Hey! He's right! [The giant patty is actually stopping from a stoplight. It turns green and the patty gets closer. They run again]
",8
19972,Lady in Green,167," Snookums! Look out! [pulls the pet worm away from the patty] You've got to promise mommy you'll be more careful! Neptune knows what he'd do if you were swallowed by the purtrid ooze that's running rampid in our streets. [Gets swallowed by krabby patty]
",8
19973,SpongeBob,167," Gary! Gary wake up! Pack up your stuff! Our house is about to be knocked over by a giant krabby patty!
",8
19974,SpongeBob,167," Wake up Patrick! We gotta get out of here!
",8
19975,Patrick,167," Huh...oh hi, SpongeBob. I just had the strangest dream, I was being chased by a giant krabby patty.
",8
19976,SpongeBob,167," That wasn't a dream!
",8
19977,Patrick,167," SpongeBob! What do we do?
",8
19978,SpongeBob,167," We'll find Sandy, she'll know what to do!
",8
19979,Patrick,167," I don't think she's home SpongeBob.
",8
19980,SpongeBob,167," She has to be, this is her treedome! Sandy where are you?
",8
19981,Sandy,167," SpongeBob?
",8
19982,SpongeBob,167," Sandy?
",8
19983,Sandy,167," No SpongeBob! Up here! [waves to SpongeBob from helicopter] And hurry! I'm running out of coconut milk!
",8
19984,SpongeBob,167," Wow, what happened to your treedome?
",8
19985,Sandy,167," Well that giant soy bean got too big, so I chopped it up into a giant salad. Anyone got any giant cruitans?
",8
19986,Patrick,167," ...I think I'm gonna be sick.
",8
19987,SpongeBob,167," What's wrong Patrick? Airsickness?
",8
19988,Patrick,167," No...the thought of a salad that size is more than I can handle.
",8
19989,Sandy,167," And now that I've mastered the soy bean, I can master that patty.
",8
19990,SpongeBob,167," Really how?
",8
19991,Sandy,167," The puzzle cube told me. The key to defeating the patty is you SpongeBob! All I have to do is get you closer to the patty so that you can make direct contact.
",8
19992,SpongeBob,167," Direct contact!? Are you sure?
",8
19993,Sandy,167," The puzzle cube never lies.
",8
19994,Sandy,167," Alright, we have visual. Putting you into position SpongeBob.
",8
19995,SpongeBob,167," Okay bye. [Ladder is hoisted back up]
",8
19996,SpongeBob,167," Well giant patty, I guess it's just you and me. Wait what was I supposed to do again?
",8
19997,Sandy,167," Just make direct contact!
",8
19998,SpongeBob,167," Direct contact, you mean like this? 
",8
19999,Sandy,167," It's working! Keep going! You can do it!
",8
20000,SpongeBob,167," Body, filling with Krabby Patty. Enormous strain.
",8
20001,SpongeBob,167," Never absorbed this much Krabby Patty into my body before! In fact, I've never absorbed any Krabby Patties into my body come to think of it!
",8
20002,SpongeBob,167," Ok...what do I do now?
",8
20003,Mr. Krabs,167," Step right up folks, for a limited time, free absorbed Krabby Patties!
",8
20004,Squidward,167," SpongeBob! Two! Medium Rare.
",8
20005,SpongeBob,167," [also talking into walkie-talkie] Copy that. Over.

20006,Mr. Krabs,167," That's it! Don't crowd! While supplies last, don't be shy! Come on!

",8
20015,Squidward,168," [gets back up] What am I doing!? What are you doing!?
",8
20016,SpongeBob,168," I am sharpening my trusty spatula. Speaking of which, are you going to stick around for morning fry-cook calisthenics?
",8
20017,Squidward,168," Cala-what?
",8
20018,SpongeBob,168," Walking to work, huh, Squidward?

20022,SpongeBob,168," Please?
",8
20023,Squidward,168," No. [the last two lines are repeated several times as they both walk, Squidward finally gets fed up with SpongeBob's repetitious begging as they enter the Krusty Krab] I said NO! I will not walk to work with yo--! [notices he is in the Krusty Krab]
",8
20024,SpongeBob,168," Okay. Maybe tomorrow, then!
",8
20025,Customer,168," I'll have 2 Krabby Patties.
",8
20026,Squidward,168," Okay. And would you like cheese on-- [he stops at a noise that sounds like someone extruding gas]
",8
20027,Customer,168," Do you...need a break or something?
",8
20028,Squidward,168," [nervously] What? Oh, no! Wha--? No-ho, that was not me, I swear. [sound repeats, the customer walks away with Squidward stuttering and begging nervously, Squidward walks into the kitchen where SpongeBob is unsuccessfully attempting to squeeze mustard onto a Krabby Patty] SpongeBob! [he snatches the mustard bottle from SpongeBob and opens the mustard bottle] It's empty! [he then shoves the mustard bottle into SpongeBob's eye] See empty!
",8
20029,SpongeBob,168," Wow, Squidward, how do you know that? [Squidward takes the mustard bottle out of SpongeBob's eye]
",8
20030,Squidward,168," Well let's see, maybe 'cause I have a brain. [as he said this, he leans on the grill]
",8
20031,SpongeBob,168," Oh-uh, Squidward, the grill is on.
",8
20032,Squidward,168," Oh, really? And do you think that I don't know that this grill is... [he sees his hand burning on the grill and then screams, he then runs around SpongeBob]
",8
20033,SpongeBob,168," I gotta do something. [he removes the mop and then takes the bucket of water, Squidward runs to the right] Okay, Squidward, this should help. [SpongeBob turns the bucket sideways and is ready pour it on Squidward but accidentally spills the water, Squidward slips on the puddle of water and is flying in mid-air] Don't worry, Squidward, I'll catch you. [he got out his jellyfishing net and holds it up to catch Squidward, but Squidward goes in the net and hit's the wall snapping the net in the process, Squidward then falls in a deep fryer and is being fried, SpongeBob screams and goes over to deep fryer and picks up the net with Squidward in it, now Squidward looks like an ice cream cone when he's fried and we see a close up of the fried Squidward] I can fix this. [he runs but he accidentally trips on the mop that was on the floor, he hit's a tin cupboard and bounces off and slams into the counter, Squidward is sent flying and into a customer's Krabby Patty taking it's place, the customer takes a bite out of Squidward causing him and the customer to scream, Squidward jumps away and flies into the other direction, SpongeBob runs to intercept him] This time I got ya. [Squidward hits SpongeBob's face and bounces off and finally crashing into a soda dispenser, SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs gasps, Squidward lies there muttering as the soda sprays on him, Mr. Krabs rushes near the mess]

20034,Mr. Krabs,168," Me soda machine!!! [he starts crying]

20035,SpongeBob,168," Squidward, can you hear me? How many fingers am I... [Squidward smacks SpongeBob away and screams, then leaps behind table, destroying it] Squidward? [Squidward screams and whacks two customers away, he climbs up wall and looks down at floor]
",8
20036,Mr. Krabs,168," You really sent him over the edge this time.
",8
20037,SpongeBob,168," Technically, I drove him up the wall.
",8
20038,Narrator,168," One shift later...
",8
20039,Squidward,168," Oh, SpongeBob, I got a present for you.
",8
20040,SpongeBob,168," A present? For me?
",8
20041,Squidward,168," Now now. Calm down. I've should've given this to you a long time ago!
",8
20042,SpongeBob,168," Wow Squidward! My very own...[Looks at the restraining order] restraining order. Uh...what is that?
",8
20043,Squidward,168," Perhaps my lawyers should explain [points over to his lawyers Harry, Combover, and Bald]
",8
20044,Harry,168," We are the law offices of Harry, Combover, and Bald! Specializing in restraining order logical law and here to tell one Mr. Squarepants...
",8
20045,"Harry, Combover, & Bald",168," YOU'VE BEEN SERVED!
",8
20046,Spongebob,168," Served? I don't understand. Squidward, what is these guys- [Before he can reach Squidward, he is stopped by Harry and Combover and Bald pushes Squidward further from him]
",8
20047,Bald,168," Per paragraph 3 of the restraining order, you may no longer speak to our client [Draws a dot circle on the ground with chalk] Likewise, you may not come within 15 feet of Mr. Squidward at any time. Any infractions of these statues will result in SERIOUS JAIL TIME!
",8
20048,SpongeBob,168," Can you make Krabby Patties for loyal Krusty Krab patrons during ""serious jail time""?
",8
20049,Bald,168," Huh? [Squidward whispers in his ear]
",8
20050,Squidward,168," And. [Back to whispering]
",8
20051,Bald,168," No.
",8
20052,SpongeBob,168," [screams] NO! I DON'T WANNA GO!
",8
20053,Combover,168," Well then, follow the guidelines we've explain and you won't have to.
",8
20054,SpongeBob,168," Uh, sirs? If I can't speak to or get within 15 feet of Squidward, how are we going to get anything done around here?
",8
20055,"Harry, Combover, and Bald",168," THAT'S NOT OUR PROBLEM. [They all fly off]
",8
20056,SpongeBob,168," [Walks in front of the dotted line] Hmm...[Next scene to him cooking Krabby Patties and puts them on a long hand-made spatula made of wood and mops] Here we go! 3 Krabby Patties, 2 large Kelpy Colas, and 3 fries ready to be served. [Tries to give Squidward the order but he puts up a glass window] Hmm? [Carries the order on the hand-made spatula with stings and another piece of wood on the other side of Squidward also in front of the door. Mr. Krabs comes in and walks right into it and it knocks him on the ground] Oops! [Run over to Mr. Krabs] Sorry about that Mr. Krabs! It's just so hard to get this food to Squidward without violating this restraining order. [Shows him the restraining order]
",8
20057,Mr. Krabs,168," Let me see that! [Takes the restraining order and wipes the mustard off him then gives it back to SpongeBob] Thank you! Look boy, I don't know what in coral cabins what a restraining order is, but I do know whatever's going on here clearly ain't working. Now I want this ship sailing smoothly! On the double! Or I'll be forced to remove more gold stars from your employee performance chart! [Takes away a star from SpongeBob's Employee Chart]
",8
20058,SpongeBob,168," [screams] Think SpongeBob think! Gasp! I got it!
",8
20059,Patrick,168," [Giggling and moves closer and closer to Squidward] Hehe.
",8
20060,Squidward,168," [Reading a book] Oh if I ignore it, maybe it will go away.
",8
20061,Patrick,168," [Still giggling] Hehe.
",8
20062,Squidward,168," I thought not [Closes the book] Oh-kay Patrick. WHAT? WHAT?! WHAT!
",8
20063,Patrick,168," [Still giggling] Notice anything... [Smacks Squidward's noise with the Krusty Krab hat he is wearing] Different? Huh? Huh? A hint! [Takes out a drawing held upside-down of the Krusty Krab hat pointing to it and his hat]
",8
20064,Mr. Krabs,168," Patrick! I am not NOT paying you to stand around and play guess what the idiot's thinking with Squidward! Get back to work!
",8
20065,Squidward,168," Yeah Patrick! Get back to...WHAT?!? WORK?!? Oh no! NO! NO! NO! Krabs! [Walks past SpongeBob who moves backwards then forwards] Mr. Krabs!
",8
20066,Mr. Krabs,168," Why all the shivering of the timbers Mr. Squidward?
",8
20067,Squidward,168," Mr. Krabs! This will not stand!
",8
20068,Mr. Krabs,168," It'll stand. Oh, unless you want to talk with SpongeBob
",8
20069,Squidward,168," What?
",8
20070,Patrick,168," Can I watch you work?
",8
20071,Squidward,168," No.
",8
20072,Patrick,168," Please? [This line is repeated several more times, as Squidward gets fed up with Patrick asking].

20073,Squidward,168," No!
",8
20074,Patrick,168," Pretty please?
",8
20075,Squidward,168," No! NO! NO! NO! GRR! [Patrick continues to follow him] Go away Patrick! Go away Patrick! Patrick! Patrick! Patrick! [Washes hands and Patrick appears in the mirror] Patrick!

20076,Mr. Krabs,168," Mr. Squidward...
",8
20077,Squidward,168," [screams]
",8
20078,Mr. Krabs,168," Time for your break [Walks off]
",8
20079,Squidward,168," Ah...don't mind if I do. [Sits down] Ah...no better way to spend a break with a little cool jazz. [Takes out the box that holds his clarinet and tries to play it but it isn't there] Huh?

20080,Patrick,168," [Comes out of the restroom] Hi Squidward!

20087,Squidward,168," PATRICK!!! [Takes back the clarinet and growls at Patrick which Mr. Krabs appears to see what is happening]

20088,Mr. Krabs,168," Nice work, Patrick! Break time's over, Mr. Squidward.

20089,Squidward,168," [Walks over to a customer] Welcome to the House of Misery. May I take your order...

20093,Squidward,168," How long you want to live? [Laughs and walks right into Patrick]
",8
20094,Patrick,168," [Laughs as Squidward's noise is stuck in is mouth. Squidward tries hard to get his nose free and he does but goes flying in the process] Hah hah! Squidward's funny! [Looks down and picks up something] Hey, a button!

20095,Squidward,168," [Crashes into the Seaberry Pie and then onto the window. Then tastes the pie] Seaberries? I'm allergic to...[Body and face puff up] Seaberries...That's it! I know what I must do! [Starts walking toward SpongeBob] SpongeBob!

20123,Karen,170," What do I owe the excessive volume of this giggling?
",8
20124,Plankton,170," You may thank my new and original idea, darling. [Karen is confused] Free samples! [Karen is still confused]
",8
20125,Karen,170," New and original, my exhaustion?
",8
20126,Plankton,170," Okay, so I didn't invent the concept, but I have improved upon it by removing the only obstacle to chum's success!
",8
20127,Karen,170," You mean the smell?  [Karen starts laughing] Smell.
",8
20128,Plankton,170," No. I mean getting the public to try some! Once everyone gets a taste of my delicious chum, they will tear this place apart to get some. Plus it's free, and who can resist free! [scene cuts in Chum Bucket, Plankton is sitting on a bench near the store with free samples] Step right up for your free samples of delicious chum!
",8
20129,Nat,170," Hey, what did he just say it was?
",8
20130,Plankton,170," I just said they're free!
",8
20131,Nat,170," Oh... I thought he said freaks. In that case... [everyone goes in line] So glad I actually left my house today.
",8
20132,Plankton,170," That's the spirit, people. Step on up, but please take your time and be orderly. I wanna savor this whole putting Krabs out of business. Business.
",8
20133,Sally,170," What is it?
",8
20134,Shubie,170," Oh, who cares silly-big-milly? It's free!
",8
20135,Sally,170," Oh, it's going to be so good cause it's free!
",8
20136,Plankton,170," Eat up. [Plankton laughs, and Shubie holds her stomach, Nancy and the Lifeguard turn green, Nancy's hair stands on end, everyone is nauseous] I have no idea that chum was this rotten. I better not be here when all this agony turns to anger. [Plankton runs]
",8
20137,Nat,170," Hey, he's making a run for it! We can't let him get away with this! Let's get up and... [Nat was nauseous again, and he spoke in a deep voice]..get him.
",8
20138,Patrick,170," ""Free samples"". [Patrick eats one of the chum and enjoys it] Yum! [Patrick eats more chum]
",8
20139,Lifeguard,170," Hey, you!, I know you're in there!
",8
20140,Plankton,170," It's not fair! If Krabs gave away free samples he wouldn't get this treatment!
",8
20141,Karen,170," If Krabs gave away free samples, he probably won't poison people thus tarnishing the good name of his restaurant.
",8
20142,Plankton,170," Yeah, I suppose you right, Karen. [Plankton got an idea] Free Krabby Patties! Step up, step up, you'll never get this chance again, folks!
",8
20143,Harold,170," Free Krabby Patties?!
",8
20144,Nat,170," Hey, what's all the hubble?
",8
20145,Nazz,170," Oh, didn't ya hear? Someone's giving away free Krabby Patties!
",8
20146,Plankton,170," That's it. [laughs]
",8
20147,Lifeguard,170," Hey, wait a minute. Aren't you the same guy who was giving away those rotten chum samples before?
",8
20148,Plankton,170," [sweated nervously] Oh, that wasn't me that was... uh... my... brother-in-law, yeah, er, Flankton.
",8
20149,Lifeguard,170," Oh, okay.
",8
20150,Plankton,170," Krabby Patties, anyone?
",8
20151,Nat,170," You!
",8
20152,Lifeguard,170," You made those awful Krabby Patties which made my eyeballs fall out!
",8
20153,SpongeBob,170," Mr. Krabs!
",8
20154,Mr. Krabs,170," Over here boy. [Mr. Krabs was hiding by the table]
",8
20155,SpongeBob,170," What is going on out there?
",8
20156,Mr. Krabs,170," The whole town has turned against me! And I have no idea why. [Lifeguard throws a brick with a note through the window] ""Because the Krabby Patty is terrible"". [gasps] Krabby Patty? Terrible? How do those words even go together?
",8
20157,SpongeBob,170," I don't know, but we have do something to turn this situation around.
",8
20158,Mr. Krabs,170," SpongeBob, you're right. We have to do everything in our power to bring those customers back. We'll triple the prices.
",8
20159,SpongeBob,170," Mr. Krabs, if you want to get customers in here, shouldn't we lower the prices?
",8
20160,Mr. Krabs,170," Fine. [Mr. Krabs lowers the price from $2.99 to $2.98] How about that? [one of the customers throw rocks] I'M RUINED! [Mr. Krabs starts crying]
",8
20161,SpongeBob,170," Mr. Krabs, if you want your customers back, we're gonna need to take more extreme measures.
",8
20162,Mr. Krabs,170," I'm all ears.
",8
20163,SpongeBob,170," We simply give Krabby Patties away for fr- [Mr. Krabs grabs SpongeBob's lips]
",8
20164,Mr. Krabs,170," Don't you say it, boy.
",8
20165,SpongeBob,170," It's the only way, Mr. Krabs. [SpongeBob was holding a stand] Alright, sir, it's time.
",8
20166,Mr. Krabs,170," Time? But it's too soon. [Mr. Krabs jumped to the stand] I'm not ready to let them go free.
",8
20167,SpongeBob,170," But you said to go ahead with the plan no matter how hard you fight me.
",8
20168,Mr. Krabs,170," I don't remember saying anything like that.
",8
20169,SpongeBob,170," I do. [SpongeBob pulled the sheet off, Mr. Krabs screams] Free Krabby Patties! Get your totally and completely free upcharge Krabby Patties!
",8
20170,Mr. Krabs,170," NO! [Mr. Krabs tries to run but his claws are in chains]
",8
20171,SpongeBob,170," It's for your own good, Eugene. Free Krabby Patties, come and get your free Krabby Patties! [the word ""patties"" echoed]
",8
20172,Mr. Krabs,170," Uh, for a second. I thought we have to give away a ton of Krabby Patties, but it looks like free ain't even enough to jump start me business. Wait, free ain't even enough, my business is doomed! [starts crying again]
",8
20173,Plankton,170," I can't really believe how well this is turning out for me today. [laughs]
",8
20174,SpongeBob,170," Hmm, looks, it's time to pull out the big guns. [SpongeBob opens the small doors and plays the calliope] No one can resist the sweet sounds of a calliope.
",8
20175,Shubie,170," Hey look, Billy, a calliope.
",8
20176,SpongeBob,170," Squidward, here's your cup like we rehearsed.
",8
20177,Squidward,170," I can't feel my legs.
",8
20178,SpongeBob,170," Here let me help you, Squidward [SpongeBob pulls Squidward's nose, Squidward goes in front of Billy]
",8
20179,Baby Billy,170," Look, mama, a monkey! [Billy throws a penny at Squidward] Dance, monkey, dance! Dance, monkey!
",8
20180,Squidward,170," I quit!
",8
20181,SpongeBob,170," Wait, Squidward, don't leave. We can't give up yet.
",8
20182,Plankton,170," Sweet and delicious victory, you are mine!
",8
20183,SpongeBob,170," Don't worry, Mr. Krabs, we'll fix this.
",8
20184,Mr. Krabs,170," Not this time boy, it's all over for the good old Krusty Krab, it's probably best if you start looking forward for a new job, boy, maybe in the different way like.
",8
20185,SpongeBob,170," You mean, different. [SpongeBob gets an idea] That's it!
",8
20186,Mr. Krabs,170," Well, that was better than I expected. Well only one more thing left to do now. I have to leave back with me mom.
",8
20187,Narrator,170," Five minutes later.
",8
20188,SpongeBob,170," Krabby Patties, brand new Krabby Patty recipe, all new, all different, all deliciousness, try them for free!
",8
20189,Nazz,170," You can't be serious.
",8
20190,Lifeguard,170," I'm so hungry, I don't care, I gotta eat something.
",8
20191,Nazz,170," No, wait!
",8
20192,Nat,170," Let him go, it's too late.
",8
20193,SpongeBob,170," All new free Krabby Patties!
",8
20194,Lifeguard,170," Hey, buddy, I'll try one, what do I got to lose. [everyone gasps, Lifeguard eats half of the Krabby Patty] Dear Neptune Gill Sacks, this is the best thing I every put in my mouth! Yay!
",8
20195,Nazz,170," Did he just say it was good?
",8
20196,Lifeguard,170," Woohoo! [Lifeguard dances]
",8
20197,Nat,170," Wow, Frank never dances, it must be good!
",8
20198,Henry-Bart,170," I'm getting something this amazing for free! How much will this buy? [Henry-Bart throws money on SpongeBob]
",8
20199,Frank,170," Yum yum yum yum yum yum. YUM! YUM! [Frank goes like a rocket] Hey, buddy boy, take my wallet, I gotta have more! [Frank goes in the stand and takes two Krabby Patties]
",8
20200,Nat and Nazz,170," Now that's what I'm talking about!
",8
20201,Nat,170," These are my savings! Just give us more Krabby Patties! [Nat and Nazz dump the money on SpongeBob]
",8
20202,Plankton,170," Don't worry, Karen, i'll be here at lunch time. My mission here is accomplished. [laughs, and then a dollar bill lands on Plankton] What the...?! [gasps]
",8
20203,SpongeBob,170," It's working!
",8
20204,Plankton,170," No, wait! What's going on? You hate Krabby Patties remember? [a dump trunk dumped money] Uh-oh. [the money landed on Plankton]
",8
20205,SpongeBob,170," We did it, Mr. Krabs! We saved the Krusty Krab! All I did was sell the old Krabby Patties, and call them new!
",8
20206,Mr. Krabs,170," Do you mind, I'm trying to make a money angel here.
",8
20207,SpongeBob,170," Oh, money angels, can I make one?

20208,Mr. Krabs,170," Sure thing, SpongeBob. Hop in! [Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob laugh. Plankton screams because Mr. Krabs is sitting on him] Did you hear what?

20217,Karen,171," Another bag of chum. [smells it] Huh, now to shape this into this your Highness' dinner request. [Karen's screen shows a drink, pizza, a hamburger and pie, then, releases laser from head then shoots it to the chum pile and the chum becomes a drink, a pie, and more chum; delivers it to Plankton.]
",8
20218,Plankton,171," [using welding tool on circuitboard] Almost done.

",8
20220,Plankton,171," What's this supposed to be?
",8
20221,Karen,171," Chum seaweed, chum pot pie, chum con coral, and chum tea. Also known as dinner.
",8
20222,Plankton,171," Karen, your memory banks are gumped up again. I did not request chum pot pie. I requested chum stir fry.
",8
20223,Karen,171," Well, I told you months ago that my memory was full but you've been too busy with your latest project. So tell me, Plankton, how do you plan on failing to steal the Krabby Patty formula this time?
",8
20224,Plankton,171," Computer wife, don't start with me! This plan is foolproof I tell you. FOOLPROOF! [laughs evilly and picks up circuit] Not only will I soon grasp the formula, but I'll get rid of your bad memory as well. [places circuitboard into motherboard of the same size and shape and presses button on motherboard] [the outer core of the button begins to transition from left to right as if identifying the percentage of time left for the robot to start up]

",8

",8
20229,Karen,171," I can't believe this! And after all I've done for you! You dumped me for this cheap pile of plastic?
",8
20230,Plankton,171," Well, I had to cut cost somewhere.
",8
20231,Karen 2.0,171," Who are you calling cheap? At least I don't rust.
",8
20232,Karen,171," You know, you're going to wish that you'd deleted that comment.
",8
20233,Plankton,171," Hey, come on, babe. Don't take it so hard. You'll find love again. Maybe you'll meet a nice...uh...adding machine.
",8
20234,Plankton,171," Oh, why did I program her with a jealousy scheduler.
",8
20235,Plankton,171," And why did I outfit her with a molecular re-arranger ray?
",8
20236,Karen,171," Here's your stir fry, little man!
",8
20237,Plankton,171," Uh, uh. Let's not do something we might regret! [He runs the other way until Karen appears in front of him]
",8
20238,Karen,171," You should know regret's the one thing you left out of my operating system! [Karen charges up her molecular rearranging ray preparing to zap Plankton, but then Karen shuts down.]
",8
20239,Plankton,171," Huh, what happened?
",8
20240,Karen 2.0,171," I accessed the Chum Bucket's power grid, remotely cutting off Karen's power at the source.
",8
20241,Plankton,171," Ha! Karen 2, I knew you were special the moment I laid eye on your motherboard. Goodbye Karen Classic. [leaps onto Karen 2.0] Hello Karen 2. [He then laughs maniacally and the camera zooms out to the Chum Bucket at night. It then pans over to the Krusty Krab where Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob are outside.]
",8
20242,Mr. Krabs,171," Ah, the end of another lucrative work day SpongeBob. [He takes out his key and locks the doors to the Krusty Krab]
",8
20243,SpongeBob,171," [in a depressed tone] Yes, the end. [filling with tears] Quitting time is almost too much to bear.
",8
20244,Mr. Krabs,171," Seriously son you gotta lighten up. Well good night kiddo. [He walks away]
",8
20245,SpongeBob,171," Good night, sir. [catches up to Mr. Krabs] See ya tomorrow.
",8
20246,Mr. Krabs,171," Yes, sir, sure as the sea's wet.
",8
20247,SpongeBob,171," Catcha later, so long. Bye Bye [Mr. Krabs narrows his eyes in annoyance as they pass the Chum Bucket.] Toodaloo! Whoa! [SpongeBob trips over something. The camera then zooms out to reveal that SpongeBob tripped over a box with Karen's body inside it.]
",8
20248,Mr. Krabs,171," Phew, would be the first I've been saved by a pile of trash. [continues to walk away]
",8
20249,SpongeBob,171," This isn't a pile of trash. [picks up Karen's head] It's a free computer system.
",8
20250,Mr. Krabs,171," [zooms back and taking Karen's head] Free! Now what kind of barnacle would throw out a perfectly good computer?
",8
20251,SpongeBob,171," Judging from our location, I'd say Plankton.
",8
20252,Mr. Krabs,171," Huh. He always has been a knucklehead.
",8
20253,SpongeBob,171," Could this be one of Plankton's elaborate ruses?
",8
20254,Mr. Krabs,171," Perhaps. But who could pass up a free computer? [packs Karen's head in the box and brings it in the Krusty Krab] Let's plug her in, see what she can do.
",8
20255,Mr. Krabs,171," She's loading up. Now let's see how this dial up thingy works. [places the telephone receiver on top of Karen and her screen shows an hourglass turning.] This thing does text mails right?
",8
20256,SpongeBob,171," Yeah, I think so.
",8
20257,Mr. Krabs,171," Oh, that sounds promising.
",8
20258,Mr. Krabs,171," Our computer's suppose to emote? No need to cry, little lady.
",8
20259,Karen,171," Don't tell me not to cry! [continues crying and scaring Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob again.]
",8
20260,Mr. Krabs,171," She's malfunctioning
",8
20261,SpongeBob,171," Must be the dial-up thingy
",8
20262,Mr. Krabs,171," You're right, must be interfering with her circuitry [grabs the telephone and throws it against the wall destroying it in the process]
",8
20263,Karen,171," Oh it's not the dial-up thingy. It's Plankton, he dumped me for a another piece of hardware. [continues crying]
",8
20264,Mr. Krabs,171," Help me out here, buddy. [pushes SpongeBob next to Karen]
",8
20265,SpongeBob,171," Hey there. Dry those computer tears. I'm sure you two will get back  together. Plankton just need some time to realize how much he needs you. I mean you guys were made for each other. Well you were made more for him and more specifically by him and now he's built someone with more modern features who's better in every way. There's no- what was my point again?
",8
20266,Karen,171," [sobs] You men are all alike! [hops off Mr. Krabs' desk and onto her mobile body. She then hops out of the box and then rolls out of the office.]
",8
20267,Mr. Krabs,171," Wait! Where ya goin? Smooth, SpongeBob, real smooth. [comes out of his office and sees Karen looking outside the window] Let's talk this out.
",8
20268,SpongeBob,171," Careful, Mr. Krabs. This still could be a ruse. Karen's loyalty maybe still be with Plankton.
",8
20269,Mr. Krabs,171," SpongeBob, what part of ""free computer"" are you not understanding?
",8
20270,Plankton,171," Tonight we celebrate and tomorrow the secret formula. [He continues laughing and the scene pans back to Karen looking out from the Krusty Krab window]
",8
20271,Karen,171," I don't ever want to see that low life again as long as I live. Goodbye you miserable little bug! [Karen's screen shows a mouse picking up a Plankton icon and placing it in the recycling bin.]
",8
20272,Mr. Krabs,171," Well in the case, welcome aboard! [puts a Krusty Krew hat on Karen's head]
",8
20273,SpongeBob,171," All right!
",8
20274,Mr. Krabs,171," Yeehaw! [They give each other high fives while Karen shows an annoyed face on her screen]
",8
20275,Squidward,171," Huh? [he stops and sees Karen at the cash register]
",8
20276,Karen,171," Welcome to the Krusty Krab. May I take you order?
",8
20277,Squidward,171," My order?
",8
20278,Squidward,171," So, I'm fired? No more taking orders? [more happily] No more interacting with customers? No more SpongeBob!? I'm free! Ha Ha! I'm free! [cheering] Whoo.
",8
20279,Mr. Krabs,171," Not so fast Mr. Squidward.
",8
20280,Ivy (gray),171," Hi there, Can I get a krabby patty and a side of coral bits please?
",8
20281,Karen,171," YOU'LL GET YOUR KRABBY PATTY WHEN I'M GOOD AND READY! [she turns to SpongeBob] Sorry I'm just [sniffs] going through a lot emotionally right now.
",8
20282,SpongeBob,171," Well, you know what cheers me up when I'm feeling down?
",8
20283,Karen,171," You defragment your hard drive?
",8
20284,Plankton,171," Hey, what's the hold up, Karen 2? That secret formula's not going to steal itself you know.
",8
20285,Karen 2.0,171," I'm trying to open the door. You didn't exactly design me with arms, you know.
",8
20286,Plankton,171," Yes I suppose that's true. All right I got this. [He is about to climb out of Karen 2.0, but then gasps when he sees Karen at the cash register.] What's she doing here? Karen, working at the Krusty Krab? What the?! 
",8
20287,Karen,171," Well, if it isn't Little Miss Home-Wrecker.
",8
20288,Karen 2.0,171," And if it isn't the washed up analog has-been.
",8
20289,Karen,171," Analog? Who you calling analog?!
",8
20290,Karen 2.0,171," I see you've taken your proper role as a ""Cash Machine.""
",8
20291,Karen,171," At least I don't look like I was designed to be a glorified vacuum cleaner!
",8
20292,Karen 2.0,171," Well, at least I can say I was designed.
",8
20293,Karen,171," [Gasps] Why I oughta...
",8
20294,Karen 2.0,171," You rusty bucket of bolts.
",8
20295,Karen,171," You glorified toaster oven!
",8
20296,Karen 2.0,171," You poor excuse for a house wife.
",8
20297,Nazz-Mini,171," What's going on?
",8
20298,Dave,171," I don't know, but my money's on the one with the chrome back side.
",8
20299,Mr. Krabs,171," Seriously? Did you just say money?
",8
20300,Mr. Krabs,171," Welcome to the fight of the century! Where for only $5.99, and the purchase of two Krabby Patties, you will plead the answer to the age-old question. Which is superior? High-speed integrated circuits?
",8
20301,Karen 2.0,171," Prepare to have your motherboard rattled.
",8
20302,Mr. Krabs,171," ...Or old-school vacuum tubes and diodes?
",8
20303,Karen,171," You're about to have your cookies crumbled.
",8
20304,Karen 2.0,171," Bring it.
",8
20305,Plankton,171," Wait! This isn't getting me any closer to the formula.
",8
20306,Karen,171," [Growls]
",8
20307,Karen 2.0,171," That will defrage your algorithms.
",8
20308,Plankton,171," [crushing sound] Ow!
",8
20309,Karen 2.0,171," Plankton?
",8
20310,Karen,171," [shakes her head] Stop! He's hurt!
",8
20311,Karen 2.0,171," You're throwing in the towel?
",8
20312,Karen,171," You heartless homepage-wrecking hussy!

20313,Karen,171," No one runs down my man. Planky, say something.

",8
20346,SpongeBob and Patrick,172," Uuh, no!
",8
20347,Mr. Krabs,172," Let me tell you the story of Face Freeze. [thunder claps, SpongeBob and Patrick's tooth chattering, breathing quickly] It were a cold day, in November, and in Bikini Bottom lived a man who loved to make faces. And the one he liked best was to stick his tongue out. [Fred raspberries and laughs] But what he really liked, was to stick his tongue at people. [Fred raspberries and laughs, Sadie and green Monroe wasps]
",8
20348,Norma Rechid,172," How rude! [Monroe cries]
",8
20349,Mr. Krabs,172," Until one day, when he stuck his tongue out for the 444th time, [Fred raspberries] his face froze with his tongue sticking out...
",8
20350,Fred,172," Huh, huh... Huh?
",8
20351,Mr. Krabs,172," Permanently!
",8
20352,Mable,172," Weirdo.
",8
20353,Fred,172," [muffled] No... no!
",8
20354,Mr. Krabs,172," He couldn't open his mouth for months. Until one day, his tongue dried up and fell off!
",8
20355,SpongeBob and Patrick,172," Oh, no!
",8
20356,Mr. Krabs,172," So are you fonna keep making faces, boys?
",8
20357,SpongeBob and Patrick,172," Huh-uh.
",8
20358,Mr. Krabs,172," Good. I hope you've learned your lesson.
",8
20359,SpongeBob,172," I'm glad Mr. Krabs caught us before it was too late. Let's agree never to make faces again.
",8
20360,Patrick,172," Done and done.
",8
20361,SpongeBob,172," Patrick! Don't even smile. That's considered making a face.
",8
20362,Patrick,172," Right, gotcha. No problem. Not gonna make faces. No faces... at all.
",8
20363,SpongeBob,172," No faces... at all. Yeah. This is... [gulps] easy. How you holding up?

20368,SpongeBob,172," Look at us. We're okay. Our faces didn't freeze.
",8
20369,Patrick,172," Gosh, you're right.
",8
20370,SpongeBob,172," Guess, Mr. Krabs made a mistake. Well, now that we know his tall tale isn't true. Let's make lots of faces.
",8

",8
20384,SpongeBob,172," I can't breathe! Well, still no frozen faces. Let's really put this myth to the test. Let's see what happens when me hold one face for a long time.
",8
20385,Patrick,172," Yes! But, now do you choose just one? Um, well, let's see. Oh, oh... How about an eye cross, [Makes his eyes go up to the top of his head] uh? And then slip into and overbite. [Pulling out upper jaw] And the finishing touch. Gah lowh.
",8
20386,SpongeBob,172," [chuckles] Delightfully wicked, my friend. I call this one... [ he push his nose and making his mouth bigger and puts out his eyeballs on the top of his head] The Gary. Meow!
",8
20387,Patrick,172," [chuckles] Gloriously disgusting, sir.
",8
20388,SpongeBob,172," Let's not keep these grotesque faces to ourselves. Let us share then with the whole wide sea. [SpongeBob and Patrick laughing both]

20399,Squidward,172," Let's try a new game. Let's combine whatever you get out of whatever this is you're doing with the quiet of sleep!
",8
20400,SpongeBob,172," Interesting challenge, but let's raise the stakes even higher. Patrick, I'll bet you can't keep that face all night, while you sleep!
",8
20401,Patrick,172," Oh yeah? Watch me.
",8
20402,Squidward,172," Whatever works.
",8
20403,SpongeBob,172," [Surprised] Wow Patrick, you did hold that face all night!

",8
20409,SpongeBob and Patrick,172," Sandy! Sandy!
",8
20410,Sandy,172," Hmmmm, this may get tricky. Y'all need to relax them facial muscles, what y'all need is a massage.
",8
20411,SpongeBob,172," And you're a licensed mussoge, right Sandy?
",8
20412,Sandy,172," Well I shouldn't say licensed. Just sit back, relax, and let my gentle mammalian hands melt away that tension. [shows Sandy's hand looking creepy]
",8
20413,Sandy,172," You seem to be carrying a lot of stress in your eyeballs. Them shoulders look way outta line. Fell them nights just meltin away. Let's see if i can just get that jaw line back in place. [Later, Sandy is done] Phew! OK you two bad news first. That wicked Face Freeze ain't going nowhere. But, y'all are looking much more relaxed.

",8
20521,Mr. Krabs,173," Squidward. But I checked out that slimy green cashier personally, and if he's sick, then I'm the next mayor of Marbleway Mountain. That doesn't sound like a bad gig actually.

No, actually that burns real bad. [worriedly] Stay calm. Just need to cool it off. Cucumber! Cucumber will cool it off! We'll just need to find some— [holds up pickle jar] pickles! Pickles, they're like cucumbers. Sweet relief, here I come. [pours all the juice and the pickles onto legs, sigh of relief turns into loud screams of pain] Sweet vinegar, it burns! It burns!

20558,SpongeBob,173," That seems like a great idea, Squidward.
",8
20559,Squidward,173," [drops tea and screams] SpongeBob, what have I told you about coming into my house?
",8
20560,SpongeBob,173," I figured I can't make you well, Squidward, but I can at least make you comfortable. I brought hot compresses, tissues, the good kind with snail butter, and even a romantic comedy for us to watch. I know they're supposed to funny, but they always make me cry.

",8
20574,SpongeBob,173," But Mr. Krabs, what are you doing here lying on the floor?
",8
20575,Mr. Krabs,173," Well, SpongeBob, funny you should ask. Because in me expert medical opinion, I think I may be coming down with a nasty case of Squid's Disease.

20715,SpongeBob,175," No.
",8
20716,Plankton,175," Sorta surley?
",8
20717,SpongeBob,175," Mm-mm.
",8
20718,Plankton,175," Maybe just a little bit jerky?
",8
20719,SpongeBob,175," No. I feel just how this cake tastes! Absolutely delicious!
",8
20720,Plankton,175," Hmm... He must have gotten a piece without Jerktonium! Here. Have some more.
",8
20721,SpongeBob,175," Don't mind if I do! [He eats the fruitcake]
",8
20722,Plankton,175," How's your dander? Is it up?
",8
20723,SpongeBob,175," No. How could I possibly be angry when my taste buds are swimming in Christmas cheer? [He takes another piece; cut to inside of his mouth]
",8
20724,Taste Bud,175," Oh, boy, here comes some more! Yaaaay!
",8
20725,Plankton,175," Grrr! Have some more! [He fires a piece into SpongeBob's mouth] Have a whole loaf! [The arm stuffs a loaf into SpongeBob's mouth] Have a baker's dozen! [He fires many fruitcakes into SpongeBob's mouth] Well?
",8
20726,SpongeBob,175," Well … [He swallows] I think everyone should taste your amazing fruitcake!
",8
20727,Plankton,175," You know what? Knock yourself out. [He throws SpongeBob the keys to the dispenser] Stupid hunk of junk-tonium! My gift to Bikini Bottom. Boy, oh, boy. [He goes back into the Chum Bucket]
",8
20728,SpongeBob,175," [Rides the dispenser up to 3 carolers] Hello, fellow revelers! Would you like a Christmas treat?
",8
20729,Bill,175," Why, sure, SpongeBob!
",8
20730,Fish 2,175," Yeah, who doesn't like treats?
",8
20731,SpongeBob,175," [Dives into the dispenser and emerges with a plate of fruitcake] Nothing loosens up the old pipes like some fruitcake. Dig in!
",8
20732,Fish 2,175," It's like a present for my mouth!
",8
20733,SpongeBob,175," I knew you'd like it.
",8
20734,Bill,175," [Grows bushy eyebrows, bags under his eyes, and five-o'clock shadow] Hey! Did we come here to sing or eat fancy cake?
",8
20735,Fish 2,175," Whoa, calm down, Bill! What do you want to sing?
",8
20736,Bill,175," Well, I want to sing the only Christmas song that matters, and that's “Jingle Bells”. From the top! A one and a two and a –
",8
20737,Fish 3,175," [Turns into a jerk] No, hold your holly! We're singing the best Christmas song ever, and that's “Silver Bells”!
",8
20738,Bill,175," Wrong bells, buddy!
",8
20739,Fish 2,175," [Turns into a jerk] Hey, I want to sing “Randolph the Red-Nosed Seahorse”!
",8
20740,SpongeBob,175," [Driving away, unaware that they have been poisoned with Jerktonium] Great to see people so passionate about the holidays.
",8
20741,Plankton,175," [Emerges from the Chum Bucket on a unicycle] What's all the racket? What do you know? The Jerktonium seems to work on these jerks. Very interesting.
",8
20742,SpongeBob,175," Oh boy, a Christmas parade! The perfect occasion to spread some mouthwatering joy. [Singing] Oh, everyone, try some hot fruitcake today. Eat it all up and you will shout “Hooray!”!
",8
20743,Bikini Bottomites,175," Yay!
",8
20744,SpongeBob,175," Everyone can get behind a mouthful of warm sunshine, everyone eat a Christmas time cliché. [People start turning into jerks. Somebody pops a kid's balloon. Another person smashes a gift over somebody's head. Pearl squirts water at passers by] Everyone can get behind a mouthful of Christmas time, let's all eat some hot fruitcake today!
",8
20745,Plankton,175," [Cycling through the rioting town] This just keeps getting better and better.
",8
20746,Costumed Santa,175," [On a float, with a boy on his knee] Ho ho ho! So, little boy, what would you like for Christmas?
",8
20747,Boy,175," I want a sled and truck and a bike and a train ...
",8
20748,SpongeBob,175," Hi, Santa! Have some fruitcake. [He throws a piece]
",8
20749,Boy,175," And a water pistol and a helicopter and – and, uh ...
",8
20750,Costumed Santa,175," [Turns into a jerk] Well, why don't you get a job and buy all that junk yourself? And while you're at it try brushing your teeth, you little -
",8
20751,SpongeBob,175," Have some fruitcake! [Hands a piece to the float driver]
",8
20752,Driver,175," Thanks! [He turns into a jerk, which shocks him in surprise] That's it! I'm outta here! [He panickedly leaves the float and it crashes off the end of a cliff]
",8
20753,Boy,175," [Bouncing on the Costumed Santa's belly] Wheeee! Oh yeah, and I want a trampoline!
",8
20754,Plankton,175," Success! Soon all the Bikini Bottomites will be jerks! Now I just need to figure out what to do about old SpongeBoy.
",8
20755,Karen,175," Once again your master plan is fatally flawed. [She brings up a diagram] It seems that SpongeBob's innocent love of the holidays shields his heart from the effects of Jerktonium.
",8
20756,SpongeBob Diagram,175," Dahahaha! That tickles.
",8
20757,Plankton,175," Drat! That square-head's gonna throw my whole naughty to nice curve right off! I guess it's time to introduce Plan B. [He pulls a lever and a giant SpongeBob robot drops from the ceiling] Hahahahaha! Plan B, meet Karen. Now go, my automated agent of naughtiness, go and destroy SpongeBob's good name! [He laughs evilly but nothing happens] Huh? Oh yeah. [He winds up a key in its back]
",8
20758,ToyBob,175," I am ready! I am ready! I am ready! Ready to destroy Christmas! [Flames shoot from his nose. He leaves the Chum Bucket and destroys a car, then heads for the Krusty Krab]
",8
20759,Mr. Krabs,175," What's goin' on out here? Oh, it's just you, SpongeBob. [ToyBob burns the Krusty Krab sign, which collapses on Mr Krabs]
",8
20760,Plankton,175," Oh, SpongeBob, you've been a bad, bad toy!
",8
20761,Patchy,175," I can't believe we survived that horrifying car accident without a scratch. [He gets out of the truck and slips on the ice] Ow! [He notices the fork in the tire] Aw, here's the problem. Oh, that's not good. Flat tire, huh? Looks as sad as an empty bag of beef. Brrr! It's cold up here. Why don't you kids at home go make a nice hot cup of cocoa while Potty builds me a fire?
",8
20762,Patchy,175," [Shivering] Hello, kiddies. It's so cold, me eye patch cracked. There hasn't been any food or water, food or food for over 20 minutes. [Coughs] Boy, I could sure go for some buffalo wings right about now. Sounds good. Eh, Potty? [He looks at Potty, imagining him as a plate of buffalo wings] With a side of blue cheese dressing. [He grabs a fork, licks his lips, and lunges at Potty who flies up and Patchy bites on the log Potty is sitting on]
",8
20763,Potty,175," Squawk! What are you doing?
",8
20764,Patchy,175," I'm sorry, Potty, I don't know what got into me. I'm just so hungry!
",8
20765,Potty,175," It's OK, Patchy, I can't stay mad at you. [He imagines Patchy's head as a suet cake and licks his beak]
",8
20766,Patchy,175," Why are you looking at me like that, bird? [Potty pecks at his head] What are you doing?
",8
20767,SpongeBob,175," Merry Christmas, fellas!
",8
20768,Bill,175," Ah, go stuff a stocking!
",8
20769,SpongeBob,175," Gee. That wasn't very nice. [He drives past Mr. Krabs, who is mending the Krusty Krab sign] Seasons greetings, Mr. Krabs!
",8
20770,Mr. Krabs,175," Will you get some nerve, SpongeBob! This is comin' outta yer salary!
",8
20771,SpongeBob,175," What's that all about? [He drives up to Patrick, who is setting another trap] Hey, Patrick! What're you up to?
",8
20772,Patrick,175," I think it's pretty obvious, SpongeBob! [He eats a slice of fruitcake] I'm eating fruitcake and setting a tiger trap for Santa! Now, if you don't mind, I'm kind of busy right now.
",8
20773,SpongeBob,175," Yeesh, OK. Don't have to be a jerk about it. Everybody's on edge today. Must be the holiday jitters.
",8
20774,Patrick,175," Nosy-body. [He falls into his own trap] Yay, it works! Hello, big striped shrimp. [He screams as it attacks him]
",8
20775,SpongeBob,175," Ah, Christmas Eve! When all of Bikini Bottom is filled with good will.
",8
20776,Johnny,175," Merry Christmas, Frankie.
",8
20777,Frankie,175," Merry Christmas to you, too, Johnny. [Throws a snowball in Johnny's face]
",8
20778,SpongeBob,175," More like bad will! Gosh, if people don't start acting nicer, Santa's going to fly right past Bikini Bottom this Christmas Eve! I'm gonna need some help. [He knocks on Squidward's door] Squidward!
",8
20779,Squidward,175," [From inside] I'm not home!
",8
20780,SpongeBob,175," Oh gosh, what do I do now?
",8
20781,Squidward,175," Why don't you go bother Sandy?
",8
20782,SpongeBob,175," Good idea, Squidward. I'll have to thank you when you get home. [He leaves, and ToyBob walks up to Squidward's house, pounding on the door]
",8
20783,Squidward,175," I said I'm not home! [ToyBob wrenches the door off its hinges] SpongeBob, give me back my door! [ToyBob smashes it over Squidward's head]
",8
20784,SpongeBob,175," Sandy, Sandy! I need your help! It's Christmas Eve and everyone in Bikini Bottom are acting like jerks! You gotta help me find out why.
",8
20785,Sandy,175," [Turns around and bares her teeth, scaring SpongeBob, except that she isn't a jerk after all] Why should I help all them jerks?
",8
20786,SpongeBob,175," Because those jerks don't care about Christmas any more, Sandy! It's a problem.
",8
20787,Sandy,175," Problem? My only problem is I'm out of fruitcake. Only thing I've got left to eat are boring old nuts. [She throws one at SpongeBob]
",8
20788,SpongeBob,175," Oh, the problem isn't the fruitcake! The problem is that everyone, including you, is acting like a jerk! Oh, I'll have to solve this on my own. [He turns to leave and slips on a nut, accidentally throwing the fruitcake into Sandy's Christmas analyzer] Whoa!
",8
20789,Sandy,175," Dagnabbit, SpongeBob, you got fruitcake in my Christmas magic analyser! [An alarm sounds] Well, I'll be hornswaggled. My analyzer's found something in the fruitcake! [She looks at the reading and gasps] This is terrible!
",8
20790,SpongeBob,175," What is it, Sandy?
",8
20791,Sandy,175," The fruitcake is contaminated with jerktonium! No wonder I've been as ornery as a sidewinder on a hot driveway. Jerktonium is the orneriest element of them all and your fruitcake is full of it. Where'd you get that fruitcake, anyway?
",8
20792,SpongeBob,175," From Plankton, he baked it.
",8
20793,Sandy,175," You took food from Plankton and fed it to everyone in town?
",8
20794,SpongeBob,175," Uh-huh.
",8
20795,Sandy,175," You're an idiot.
",8
20796,SpongeBob,175," Uh-huh.
",8
20797,Sandy,175," No wonder everyone in town is a big old meanie.
",8
20798,SpongeBob,175," Oh! I've eaten tons of that fruitcake! I must be the biggest jerk in town!
",8
20799,Sandy,175," [Pokes him] Hmm … You don't act jerky. For some reason it's not affecting you. [She puts a scanner in front of him] It must be a combination of your tiny brain and pure heart. You're immune to Jerktonium, SpongeBob, but the rest of us will need an antidote. I'll set the analyzer to calculate the formula. [She pulls a switch and a music score pops out] Why, this formula for the antidote don't make no sense at all!
",8
20800,SpongeBob,175," Hmm… That's not a formula! That's a song! [He hums it, and Sandy becomes her normal self] Sandy! The song is the antidote!
",8
20801,Fish 6,175," Oh yeah? Well your fins are fat!
",8
20802,Fish 7,175," Says who?
",8
20803,SpongeBob,175," [Singing] Bring joy to the world, it's the thing to do, but the world does not revolve around you. Don't be a jerk. It's Christmas! [Throws a snowball at Mr Krabs and cures him] Be nice to babies and animals, old folks, too. 'Cause that's how you'd like them to treat you! Use turn signals. Don't screen my calls. Don't you wreck the house when you deck the halls. Spit your gum where it won't wind up on my shoe. Squeeze toothpaste from the bottom of the tube. Don't be a jerk. It's Christmas! It's Christmas!
",8
20804,SpongeBob's Friends and Co.,175," [in background chorus' voices] Jolly, not jerky!
",8
20805,SpongeBob,175," Santa brought nearly every gift on your list. Why whine about the one that he missed? Don't be a jerk, it's Christmas! It's Christmas! Don't be a jerk. It's Christmas!
",8
20806,Sandy,175," Congratulations, SpongeBob, your song worked!
",8
20807,SpongeBob,175," And not a moment too soon. Santa should be here any minute.
",8
20808,Mr. Krabs,175," You ain't kiddin'. Here he comes now!
",8
20809,SpongeBob,175," Oh, boy! Santa! You made it!
",8
20810,Santa,175," Whoa, ho, ho, ho, ho! Cool your jets there, son. I'm afraid I'm the bearer of bad tidings.
",8
20811,SpongeBob,175," Oh, no!
",8
20812,Santa,175," Oh, yes. It seems you're all on my naughty list, this year.
",8
20813,SpongeBob,175," Naughty list?
",8
20814,Santa,175," No buts about it. You've all been a bunch of jerks.
",8
20815,SpongeBob,175," But---!
",8
20816,Santa,175," But nothing! Coal for everyone! Except Plankton.
",8
20817,SpongeBob and Friends and Co.,175," WHA-A-AT?!?
",8
20818,Santa,175," I'm just as surprised as you, but compared to the rest of you, he's been a saint.  [Hands him the Krabby Patty formula] Here you go, Sheldon, I believe this is what you asked for.
",8
20819,Mr. Krabs,175," Me secret formula? How did you get that?
",8
20820,Santa,175," I have MY ways.
",8
20821,Pearl,175," Um...Dad?
",8
20822,Mr. Krabs,175," Huh? [Slaps the elf] Get out of me pocket, ya foul goblin!
",8
20823,SpongeBob,175," But- but- but- but- but- but---! [Patrick slaps him] But, Santa, you've got it all wrong!
",8
20824,Santa,175," On the contrary, SpongeBob, you're the worst of all. There you go, right now---wreaking havoc!
",8
20825,Plankton,175," Uh-oh.
",8
20826,ToyBob,175," [Focuses on SpongeBob, Plankton and Santa] I am ready to destroy Christmas! [transforms into his mega mode] Destroy Santa!
",8
20827,SpongeBob,175," You want Santa, you gotta get through me!
",8
20828,Mega ToyBob,175," Okey-dokey. [Karate chops SpongeBob]
",8
20829,Santa,175," Oh, my.
",8
20830,SpongeBob,175," Is that all you got?
",8
20831,Santa,175," I'm outta here! [He hides in the Krusty Krab, but ToyBob finds him and picks him up] You do realize this counts as, naughty.
",8
20832,SpongeBob,175," You put that jolly elf down, you big tin imposter! [Fires fruitcake at Mega ToyBob] Hot from the oven, full of lovin'! [Rushes back to rescue Santa] Hurry up, Santa, hop on!
",8
20833,Santa,175," Thanks again for saving my keister.
",8
20834,SpongeBob,175," Oh, it was nothing.
",8
20835,Santa,175," You're clearly a very good lad, unlike the owner of that wind-up monstrosity! [An elf hands him the wind-up key] What have we got here? ""If found, please return to the Chum Bucket""?!? PLANKTON!!!
",8
20836,Plankton,175," Uh-oh.
",8
20837,Mr. Krabs,175," Hand it over, Sheldon. Don't make it any worse. [Takes the Krabby Patty formula. Plankton gets flung at Santa's sleigh, and he splatters all over it. He falls off, leaving squish marks on the sleigh]
",8
20838,Santa,175," O.K., boys, let's give Plankton what he deserves. [The elves pour coal onto Plankton] So long, kiddies! Ho-o-o-o, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! [He flies away as everyone [except Squidward] waves goodbye to him]
",8
20839,SpongeBob,175," Hey, has anyone seen Patrick?
",8
20840,Patrick,175," [Hiding on Santa's sleigh]  Gotcha! [Catches Santa in a net, sending the sleigh off course]
",8
20841,Patchy,175," [Notices a sign] Santa's workshop? I'm here, Santa! I'm here!
",8
20842,Potty,175," I'm not going in there.
",8
20843,Patchy,175," Santa! [He sits on Santa's lap and pulls out his letter] There's only thing I wants for Christmas! And it's to meet me hero, SpongeBob SquarePants. [Santa sprinkles magic dust on Patchy to make his wish come true, then the illusion breaks and Patchy realizes he's in a cave with a polar bear who sprinkled him with salt because he wants to eat him. The bear chases him. The scene then cuts to Potty standing next to Santa]
",8
20844,Santa,175," I think stealing a mail truck definitely counts as naughty. Wouldn't you say, Potty?
",8
20845,Potty,175," I sure would, Santa!

20846,Both,175, Merry Christmas!,8

[Twirls] I'm going to work. I'm going to work, going to work, go-going to work. I'm crossing the street! [does so] I'm crossing the street! Cross- whup! [Listens] I'd recognize that sound anywhere!

20857,SpongeBob,176," Plankton, what's got you so upset? I can hear you from three blocks away!
",8
20858,Plankton,176," Oh, that. It's this doomsday device I invented. [Holds up small device] It just doesn't do what it's supposed to do! 
",8
20859,SpongeBob,176," Doomsday device? What's it supposed to do?
",8
20860,Plankton,176," Well, it's supposed to upset the Earth's axis. Causing a chain reaction with typhoons, earthquakes, etc.
",8
20861,SpongeBob,176," So, what does it do instead?
",8
20862,Plankton,176," It just sparks and falls apart.

20866,Plankton,176," Oh, what's the use?!  Everyday the same old thing. Life is an endless succession of failures and disappointments. 
",8
20867,SpongeBob,176," Well, look on the bright side, Plankton. If all your hopes and dreams finally came true, then you wouldn't have anything left to look forward to.
",8
20868,Plankton,176," Well, I didn't think I could feel any worse, but at least I know now that anything is possible.

20869,SpongeBob,176," Plankton wait! [Holds out arms to stop him] Wait! [Long pause] Wait!
",8
20870,Plankton,176," I'm waiting!

20871,SpongeBob,176," Maybe what you need is to join a club or something. Meet new people. You know, make some friends.
",8
20872,Plankton,176," Hmmm. Yes. Yes. Are you suggesting I form an evil alliance?
",8
20873,SpongeBob,176," Um, something like that. 
",8
20874,Plankton,176," That is an excellent idea! But where would someone like me find new friends? 
",8
20875,SpongeBob,176," Well, usually when I'm trying to find something, I just look it up in the phone book. [Holds up yellow phone book. Then he gives it to Plankton] 
",8
20876,Plankton,176," [Struggles with phone book in his hands] [Sarcastically] Oh, great. Thanks. [Throws book on the ground and climbs on it.] Let's see here. Aha!  Here we go. [Reads off of phone book] Evil villain for hire. Call Man Ray. No job too diabolical.
",8
20877,SpongeBob,176," Man Ray? But he's one of Bikini Bottom's most notorious super villains! Arch nemesis of fame television super heroes Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. [Gets confused]He's in the phone book? [Plankton laughs] Plankton, you were looking under Fiends not Friends.
",8
20878,Plankton,176," Oh, I know, SpongeBob. I know. [Tries to hold in his laughter, but he can't and starts laughing again. SpongeBob laughs with him. He then stops and gets confused. Bubble transition to Man Ray in the Bargain Mart putting stuff into vending machines.] Man Ray! We meet at long last! And who would have thought to find here you here, working a part-time job restocking vending machines? That's very clever, Man Ray. Very clever. And now let us join in evil alliance!  
",8
20879,Man Ray,176," Have we met? 
",8
20880,Plankton,176," [Chuckles] Don't you remember? We spoke on the phone. I, Plankton know of a secret formula.  A formula that holds [whispers] THE SECRET. The oh, so precious secret of the Krusty Krab. And he who controls the Krusty Krab controls Bikini Bottom. Once that formula is in out possession, we- [Is interrupted by Man Ray picking up a box.] 
",8
20881,Man Ray,176," Una! [Looks down at Plankton] I'm listening. 
",8
20882,Plankton,176," Then together we will steal the formula, crush Mr. Krabs and RULE THE WORLD! MWA HAHAHAHA! [Bubble transition to the Krusty Krab while Mr. Krabs is whistling.]
",8
20883,Mr. Krabs,176," [Notices a tape measure at his feet. It wiggles and slides away.] Huh? [Sees Plankton holding the tape measure] Plankton! 
",8
20884,Plankton,176," Oh, don't mind me, Krabs. I'm just taking a few measurements. I want to make sure there's enough room to install a hot tub when I assume ownership of this dump. [Mr. Krabs takes him outside, about to fling him away.] But before you toss me out like yesterday's garbage, there's someone I'd like you to meet. Come on out, partner. 
",8
20885,Mr. Krabs,176," Partner? That's the silliest thing you've ever- [Screams as his eyes bulge out. Man Ray runs toward him while flipping over a rock and hitting the ground in front of Mr. Krabs and Plankton.]

20886,Plankton,176," I want you to say hello to my new partner and your new overlord, Man Ray. 
",8
20887,Mr Krabs,176," [Nervously] Hello. [Runs away while screaming and dropping Plankton.] 
",8
20888,Man Ray,176," Hm, was it something I said? 
",8
20889,Mr. Krabs,176," HANG ON TO YOUR HATS AND GLASSES! DOOM IS UPON US! [Runs around]  And it's dressed in a red leotard! 
",8
20890,SpongeBob,176," [Is holding onto a Krusty Krab cup] Mr. Krabs! You said to hold onto your glasses! When all I could find were these extra large milkshake cups!  Do these count?
",8
20891,Mr. Krabs,176," Never mind that now! I want you to go up to the roof, and light the Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Emergency Search Light. 
",8
20892,SpongeBob,176," Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Emergency Search Light? What for?
",8
20893,Mr. Krabs,176,"  Because! We're having an EMERGENCY! [Shouts so loud that is shakes the whole Krust Krab.] 
",8
20894,SpongeBob,176," Aye aye, captain! [Runs away leaving the cups floating in midair. Mr. Krabs looks at them suspiciously and they fall.] 
",8
20895,Plankton,176," It looks like Krabs isn't as foolish as I thought. He's boarded-up the front entrance. [He points to a boarded-up entrance to the Krusty Krab.] I think you know what we need to do now. 
",8
20896,Man Ray,176," Right, of course. [Holds up laser gun and shoots the door.]
",8
20897,Mr. Krabs,176," You can relax now, Squidward. They're not getting in- [boards start to dissolve behind him.] Never mind. 
",8
20898,SpongeBob,176," [Runs through door on the roof] Where is it? Where is it? That search light could be anywhere up here! Oop! There! [points to a huge light that you couldn't possibly miss. He presses an on button and the light turns on.] Yes! Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy will be here in no time! [Waits. Nothing happens.] Hmm. I guess this is only good for nighttime emergencies. [Bubble transition to Shady Shoals Retirement Home. SpongeBob runs up to the front counter.] HELP! HELP! Must-find-Mermaid-Man-Barnacle-Boy! Man-Ray-Krusty-Krab-taking-over! [Two workers look at each other and take SpongeBob out of the retirement home.] 
",8
20899,Worker #1,176," Sorry, kid. This is a retirement community, not an insane asylum. [Both workers walk away. SpongeBob looks through an open window and sees a bunch of old people sitting in chairs. Finally, he sees Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. Mermaid Man is snoring away while Barnacle Boy looks board. He sips his drink casually.SpongeBob gasps and tries knocking on the glass.]
",8
20900,Mermaid Man,176," [wakes up] Huh? Do you hear that? 
",8
20901,Barnacle Boy,176," Probably just the old air conditioner acting up.
",8
20902,Mermaid Man,176," [Stands up tiredly] I'll fix it! [Walks over to the window where SpongeBob is. SpongeBob waves at him. But Mermaid Man starts to punch the air conditioner.] You old piece of junk! [He keeps pounding it until it goes through the window and falls on SpongeBob.] Yep, that must've been it. It's not making that sound anymore. [Sits down on the couch again.]
",8
20903,Plankton,176," Well, well, well, the Krusty Krab is finally ours! [Mr. Krabs and Squidward put their hands up.] Now we can take the secret formula and rule the world. Hand it over, Eugene. 
",8
20904,Mr. Krabs,176," No way! You'll never know the secret of making Krabby Patties! 
",8
20905,Man Ray,176," Wait a minute, I thought you said this was the secret formula for world domination. 
",8
20906,Mr. Krabs,176," Squidward... SQUIDWARD! 
",8
20907,Squidward,176," Huh? I don't get paid enough for this.
",8
20908,SpongeBob,176," Hmm. [He sucks all the air out of himself which makes him look all dried up and old. He walks past the worker working at the front counter.] Good afternoon. 
",8
20909,Worker #1,176," Good afternoon, sir!
",8
20910,SpongeBob,176," Mermaid Man! Barnacle Boy! [a lady stops him]
",8
20911,Elderly Lady,176," May I have this dance?
",8
20912,SpongeBob,176," Of course. [Starts to dance with her, but he notices Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy leaving the snack table.] I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to excuse myself. I-uh...
",8
20913,Old Lady,176," [Walks up to SpongeBob] Hi, handsome. Do you wanna dance? 
",8
20914,SpongeBob,176," Certainly. [They dance.] 
",8
20915,Elderly Lady,176," Hands off, I saw him first! 
",8
20916,Old Lady,176," That's what you think, sister. [All the ladies in the room start to come toward SpongeBob, fighting to get him.] 
",8
20917,Crowd,176," No, I saw him first! Nuh uh! He's mine!
",8
20918,SpongeBob,176," Mermaid Man! Barnacle Boy!
",8
20919,Barnacle Boy,176," I never really liked these things, anyway. [He and Mermaid Man walk away from the snack table]
",8
20920,SpongeBob,176," Ahhh! Mermaid Man!
",8
20921,Plankton,176," [Squidward brings Man Ray a tray of Krabby Patties.] Ah, here we go! 
",8
20922,Squidward,176," Two Krabby Patties. Enjoy your meal. 
",8
20923,Plankton,176," Oh, we will! We'll enjoy it a lot, slave. [Man Ray picks up his patty and eats it, and afterwards, he burps.] Well! Now that you've experienced a Krabby Patty firsthand, are you ready to assume control of the secret formula and take over the world? 
",8
20924,Man Ray,176," Hmm... it certainly was tasty, but I think I need to try another one before I know for sure. [Picks up other patty.]
",8
20925,Plankton,176," Hey! That one was mine! [Man Ray burps] Well, are you satisfied? Can we get on with our lives now? 
",8
20926,Man Ray,176," Hmm... satisfied... not quite! I think this will require another helping of ""research"". Hey, you there! Another platter of your finest Krabby Patties, please.  [Plankton sighs]
",8
20927,SpongeBob,176," Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy! Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy! Mermaid Man and- [slips on a wet floor] Whoa! [He slips to the end of the hallway, where he breaks through a door.]
",8
20928,Barnacle Boy,176," What the?
",8
20929,Mermaid Man,176," Is nap time over already?
",8
20930,SpongeBob,176," Come quick! The Krusty Krab is in dire strieghts! Plankton and Man Ray teamed up and blah blah blah blah blah blah! 
",8
20931,Mermaid Man,176," This must be one of the new guys.
",8
20932,Barnacle Boy,176," No kidding, we'd like to help out, but we can't just yet.
",8
20933,SpongeBob,176," [Sternly] What do you mean you can't?
",8
20934,Barnacle Boy,176," We just woke up from our nap. 
",8
20935,Mermaid Man,176," And after naptime is when they usually serve ICE CREAM!
",8
20936,Barnacle Boy,176," So in the meantime, uh, you're gonna have to be your own hero.
",8
20937,Mermaid Man,176," Unless you wanna wait for ice cream too? [SpongeBob stands there, awkwardly.]
",8
20938,Squidward,176," SpongeBob, where have you been? I've been covering for you on the grill for the past 3 hours! My arm feels like it's gonna snap in half!
",8
20939,Man Ray,176," [Is still eating Krabby Patties.] 
",8
20940,Squidward,176," It's that guy in red. He's a really high maintenance customer.
",8
20941,Plankton,176," Can we please steal the secret formula now? Pretty please, Man Ray?
",8
20942,Man Ray,176," I must have more! [Starts to pound on the table] Bring me more Krabby Patties! Bring more Krabby Patties!  [Shoots roof with laser gun] 
",8
20943,SpongeBob,176," Stand aside, Squidward. I'm gonna be my own hero. [Slides into the kitchen, and runs out to Man Ray with hundreds of Krabby Patties.] Thank you, sir! Enjoy your meal. 
",8
20944,Man Ray,176," At last! [Starts to eat away at the Krabby Patties.] 
",8
20945,Plankton,176," Alright, fine! I'll just steal the secret formula myself! [Grabs Man Ray's laser gun] Oh, and Man Ray, this friendship is over! [Man Ray burps, which causes Plankton to drop the gun.]

",8
20949,Barnacle Boy,176," A little sponge told us. [They pull Man Ray away]

",8
20973,Squidward,177," I try not to look directly at the customers.
",8
20974,Mr. Krabs,177," Well, according to my research, a full 2% of the population of Bikini Bottom has never set foot in the Krusty Krab. That's 2% of money that's not in me pocket. And when I see that 2%, I get soooooo maaaad!
",8
20975,SpongeBob,177," When I see that 2%, I think of pie!
",8
20976,Mr. Krabs,177," I'm not talking about pie! [throws chart away] These holdouts are probably spending their money in some other restaurant! We need to find that 2% and reel them in. So I want you two to promote the Krusty Krab!

21039,SpongeBob,177," Here they come! [Many people end up falling in front of the Krusty Krab] Let's go inside! We did it, Mr. Krabs! Soon, you'll have more customers than you'll know what to do with!

21387,Patrick,180," No way! [Patrick rips off Mabel's head, which is actually a mask. SpongeBob gasps. The Dirty Bubble emerges from the clothes of Mabel and laughs maniacally] Hey! Where'd he come from?

21393,Dirty Bubble,180," [laughs] I wouldn't call that a total miss. [Patrick has a table in his hand]
",9
21394,Patrick,180," Take this, beast! [Throws table, along with another barrel, but both miss. The table hits the cashier boat and the barrel hits the glass wall of the Krusty Krab and shatters it. Patrick grabs SpongeBob]

21395,SpongeBob,180," Wha, no, Patrick! [Patrick throws him]
",9
21396,Dirty Bubble,180," Haha, yummy sponge.

21397,Mr. Krabs,180," You've disabled my employees and trashed me restaurant?! Think you might go for the Bubble now?
",9
21398,Patrick,180," I've got him right where I want him. For the Pit Punch! [Stench from Patrick's armpit forms a pit and flies toward the Dirty Bubble. The Dirty Bubble swallows it and it hits SpongeBob]
",9
21399,Dirty Bubble,180," Ha! Let's try that again, but this time, I attack! [Dirty Bubble is flying towards Patrick. Patrick gets scared. He looks down and sees an dirty Krabby Patty and picks it up]
",9
21400,Patrick,180," Lunch! [Patrick's ice cream cone point pops the charging Dirty Bubble, defeating him. The fish hiding behind the tables cheer in approval and Patrick eats the Krabby Patty]

21401,SpongeBob,180," Way to go, buddy! You're a hero! Uh, may I have your autograph?

21402,Patrick,180," Why of course, young man. That's uh, SpongeBob with two 7s, right?

21404,Patrick,180," Actually, [takes off the cone on his head] it's Patrick to you. [Eats cone] I'm retiring. Having a job is too much work.

21430,Captain Frostymug,181," [Tastes one of the milkshakes] FANTASTIC! Nice and creamy mouth feel! [Notices SpongeBob randomly pressing a button] SquarePants appears to be having problems...AGAIN! You! Please explain where he has gone wrong!
",9
21431,Cadet 2,181," Sir, yes sir! Sir! He is attempting to use the upper control panels to mix! Sir! Every cadet knows that these are telementry functions [Points to a button on a lower panel] And all of the controls are on the lower panel! Sir!
",9
21432,SpongeBob,181," Oh! That's right! Heh, how silly of me! Mr. Krabs' right. [Grabs the cup] Milkshaking has changed over the years. [Press the button and starts to blend up a milkshake]
",9
21433,Captain Frostymug,181," Very good! But how does it taste? [SpongeBob turns off the machine and puts whipped cream on it and puts a cherry on top and gives it to him. He then lifts up the cup ready to taste it but it smashes him in the eye] Maybe we need to get back to basics...
",9
21434,Captain Frostymug,181," Listen up Cadet Squarepants! If you want to make a milkshake, you gotta know how it feels to be a shake! [Shows a large, milkshake-shaped machine] Behold! The Shake Simluator! In you go! NOW! MARCH! HUT TWO THREE FOUR! HUT TWO THREE FOUR! HUT! [SpongeBob runs into the machine and Frostymug pushes a button causing another machine to lift SpongeBob up] Teach this upstart a lesson, I'm setting it to ""OBLiTERATE!"" [Turns the dial to obliterate which causes the other cadets to gasp]
",9
21435,Cadet 2,181," But sir! No one's ever survived ""OBLiTERATE!""
",9
21436,Captain Frostymug,181," SILENCE!!! He needs to learn cadet!
",9
21437,Captain Frostymug,181," Now, let's see how the boy turned out! [Presses a button which causes the machine to pour out SpongeBob who fills up the cup]
",9
21438,SpongeBob,181," That was fun! Can I go again?
",9
21439,Captain Frostymug,181," Never, in my thirty years of milkshake instruction, have I had such an unteachable moron! CADETS! Do you have any ideas on how to teach Cadet SpongeBob?
",9
21440,Cadet 3,181," You'd be better off teaching a hunk of coral, sir! [He and the other cadets laugh at SpongeBob]
",9
21441,SpongeBob,181," I'll show you! I'll show you all I can make a milkshake! [Marches off. Bubble transition to SpongeBob riding a motorcycle to a sunset. Cue montage with the other cadets shooting cherries at the milkshake target. Cadet 2 succeeds and SpongeBob tries a go. He shoots the cherry but it shoots off the top and starts bouncing all over the place and eventually hits Captain Frostymug on his behind. Bubble transition to SpongeBob blending a milkshake but it turns into a Krabby Patty. Bubble transition to SpongeBob playing volleyball with three other cadets. The volleyball lands in SpongeBob's mouth but he shoots it out through his head and he starts to sweat. He then is handed a milkshake and drink it and pours the rest on his head and he starts to slowly shake it off. Bubble transition to SpongeBob and Frostymug riding in airplanes. Frostymug opens his and holds out a cup. SpongeBob then pulls a level causing ice cream to come out but it misses the cup and lands in Frostymug's turbine causing his plane to catch on fire and crash but Frostymug safely floats down on a parachute. Bubble transition to the other cadets blending milkshakes and Frostymug drinking them using his bendy straw. They all succeed until he reaches SpongeBob and his milkshake bends Frostymug's straw. End montage and bubble transition to a ceremony room]
",9
21442,Captain Frostymug,181," When you first came to me just four short hours ago, you were nothing but a bunch of soda jerks! But now, you stand before me proud, mighty, milkshake makin' machines! It is with great pride I bestow upon you your milkshake operator license! Now, come up here and get them! [Starts handing out licenses and shaking the hands of the other cadets until he reaches SpongeBob] Well! I'm afraid there're aren't no more milkshake licenses. And do you know why?
",9
21443,SpongeBob,181," Um...the printer ran out of ink?
",9
21444,Captain Frostymug,181," NO YOU SIMPLETON! There're aren't anymore milkshake licenses because YOU don't get one! [Pushes SpongeBob's mouth in]
",9
21445,SpongeBob,181," [Pulls out mouth] Why not?
",9
21446,SpongeBob,181," [Rushes over to the machine putting the cup under it] NO Captain Frostymug! I can do it! Let me show you! I just know I can! [Turns on the machine]
",9
21447,Captain Frostymug,181," No, here let me show you! [Grabs the cup] You're suppose to raise the cup to the spinny thing! [Starts suddenly sweating and looking nervous] Um, the...the spinny thing...
",9
21448,Customer,181," Boy! I can't wait to have one of your renowned shakes Sir Frostymug!
",9
21449,Young Frostymug,181," You tried the rest, now prepare for the best! [Turns on the machine and the milkshake sprays on a electrical cord which causes the machine to spray milkshake on all of the customer's faces. They all start to scream and run all over the place] NOOOOO!
",9
21450,Captain Frostymug,181," NOOOO!!!!
",9
21451,SpongeBob,181," What's wrong Captain Frostymug?
",9
21452,Captain Frostymug,181," I haven't touched a milkshake machine in twenty years! [Gets his arm caught in the blender] DEAR NEPTUNE'S THUNDERCLAP! I'm stuck in the blender! HELP!
",9
21453,SpongeBob,181," CAPTAIN FROSTYMUG!
",9
21454,Captain Frostymug,181," [His whole body starts to slowly get sucked in the blender] [screaming] MY ARM!! [screaming]
",9
21455,SpongeBob,181," Don't worry sir! I'm coming! [Grabs onto Frostymug] Gotcha Captain!
",9
21456,Captain Frostymug,181," Save yourself boy! I'm a goner!
",9
21457,SpongeBob,181," NO! I'm not leaving you behind! [Pulls Frostymug from the blender and the machine explodes. He then places Frostymug down]
",9
21458,Captain Frostymug,181," Thanks, SpongeBob! [Cough] You now, no one has ever treated me this old captain with much kindness. And in return, I'd like to tell you a little secret. All these years, I've been able to make milkshakes without machines because making milkshakes really comes from within! Does that make sense?
",9
21459,SpongeBob,181," Not at all...
",9
21460,SpongeBob,181," One milkshake, coming right up! [Tosses the ice cream into his body and starts shaking and pours the milkshake into the glass from his head, then whipped cream, then a cherry on top]
",9
21461,Harold,181," [Tastes it] You redeemed yourself SpongeBob! This is the BEST milkshake I'd ever had! [Other customers line up behind him with money]
",9
21462,Mr. Krabs,181," Where'd you learn those moves, SpongeBob?
",9
21463,Captain Frostymug,181," [Enters on a wheelchair] That would be from me! And in light of decent events, SpongeBob. I'd like to give you this [Hands SpongeBob his milkshake license]
",9
21464,SpongeBob,181, Gasp! My milkshake license! If only if were this easy to get a boating license! [Laughs],9

",9
21735,Prison Guard 1,184," Oh he does, does he? I'll be the judge of that. [Smells the napkin and passes out. The Purple Cellmate drags him inside. Plankton and the rest of his Cellmates walk outside]

21736,Plankton,184," Chum! [A Cellmate hands him chum] Detonator! [A Cellmate hands him a bar of soap with wires in it] Is this detonator made out of soap?

21743,Plankton,184," What in the name of electrolysis!?
",9
21744,Prison Guards 1,184," Nice try prisoners! But you'll never penetrate a wall of living guards! Let's round up those escaping miscreants! [Tries to move] Oh dear! I cannot move! It appears we have become ensnared in our own defenses! 
",9
21745,Plankton,184," Oh my! That is a dilly of a pickle! Oh well, if you cannot escape through the back wall, I guess we have to leave through the front door! [He and the rest of his Cellmates leave through the front gate] Quickly my fellow felonons!

[A female scream is heard]
",9
21774,SpongeBob and Patrick,185," Uh-oh.
",9
21775,Patrick,185," Hey, SpongeBob...
",9
21776,SpongeBob,185," Yes, Patrick?
",9
21777,Patrick,185," Do you know how to swim?
",9
21778,SpongeBob,185," No.
",9
21779,Patrick,185," Me neither.
",9
21780,SpongeBob,185," Hmm, I wonder why we're not sinking to the bottom of Goo Lagoon. [A big round purple object lifts Patrick into the air. Patrick screams] Patrick, you're floating!
",9
21781,Patrick,185," Oh. [another one lifts SpongeBob in the air] Hey, you're floating too! What happened?
",9
21782,SpongeBob,185," [He looks down at his object] These weird bubbles saved us.
",9
21783,Patrick,185," [He pokes on his bubble] It's all purple and sticky.
",9
21784,SpongeBob,185," [He sticks his hand on the bubble and stretches it a little] And it's really stretchy. It's some kind of goo bubble.
",9
21785,Patrick,185," [He smells the goo bubble] Well, the smell makes my nose tickle. [He sneezes which causes the bubble to bounce on the lagoon's surface. He giggles.] Hey, it bounces! 
",9
21786,Patrick,185," Sorry! 
",9
21787,"[The scene changes to show on a surfer, who is normally the lifeguard, wearing Patrick like pants surfing on a wave. SpongeBob goes through the top of the wave and hits him on the head. This causes him to lose his balance and wipe out. The surfer reaches the surface and gasps for ""air"". Patrick also bounces on him, causing him to go back under the surface of the lagoon. The scene changes to show a group of water ski acrobats and Thaddeus is driving the boat. The group consists of",185," on the bottom, Blue Fred, Sadie, and an orange fish; in the middle, Sandals and Nazz-Mimi; on the top, Dale, who is holding two red flags. Patrick comes and bounces on the group, knocking them over. The scene changes to show Plankton selling chum in a cart on the beach, while wearing a farmer's hat and a red bandanna]
",9
21788,Plankton,185," Chum! Get your red, hot chum here! What's the deal? According to my algorithm, [He takes out a calculator with the number ""102682"" on it.] beach-goers should be famished [He throws the calculator behind him] and looking for a treat. A treat like chum! Hello? It's perfectly edible, people! [A pole destroys Plankton's chum cart and causes his outfit to fly away] Oh, come on, man! This is my livelihood! 
",9
21789,Squidward,185," [opens his umbrella] Ah, a beautiful day beachside. I couldn't think of a thing that could ruin this. [lays down on his chair]
",9
21790,Plankton,185," I could think of a few.
",9
21791,Squidward,185," [puts tanning lotion on his nose and lays down to tan with his tanning mirror. A big shadow appears above Squidward] Hey, you're blocking my light. [SpongeBob appears from the sky, laughing, and crashes into Squidward with his goo bubble. This causes Squidward to go under the sand and to destroy both the umbrella and the chair. Squidward pops out of the sand] SpongeBob. [Another shadow appear and Patrick's laughter is heard. Patrick appears and also crashes onto Squidward, who screams, with his goo bubble. Again, Squidward goes under the sand. Squidward pops out of the sand with his tanning mirrors stuck to his head like a flower's petals. Plankton walks up to Squidward]
",9
21792,Plankton,185," Ah, sweet karma. It can come from the most boneheaded of places. [He notices SpongeBob and Patrick bouncing on their goo bubbles while laughing] Wait a second. What are those bouncing blobs of goo?
",9
21793,Squidward,185," [growls] I don't know and I don't care! [SpongeBob and Patrick continue to bounce and laugh on their goo bubbles until Squidward steps in front of them] Hold it! [SpongeBob and Patrick stop bouncing and their bubble drop to the ground] What I want to know is why you two have ruined my attempts of having an even tan!
",9
21794,SpongeBob,185," Oh, sorry, Squidward. We're riding on these cool [He steps off the bubble and lifts it] goo bubbles. They're floating out of Goo Lagoon. 
",9
21795,Sandy,185," Stop! [She exits the suit] Those bubbles are dangerous!
",9
21796,Plankton,185," Dangerous?
",9
21797,SpongeBob,185," [The scene changes to show Squidward, Patrick and SpongeBob. Patrick and SpongeBob are holding their bubble separately] Fascinating. Tell us more.
",9
21798,Patrick,185," Yeah, but with visual aids.
",9
21799,Plankton,185," That rodent's right. A giant goo bubble could really level the playing field. If someone were able to control its power, they'd control all of Bikini Bottom. And I'm going to be that someone. [lifts the panel's cover and pushes a red button on the bucket and door opens. The exterior is barely shown, but of what is shown, it looks similar to the Chum Bucket's lab interior. He goes inside and the door closes. The bucket sinks into the sand and a purple and light purple clam-shaped sub flies out and dives into the lagoon.]
",9
21800,SpongeBob,185," It's so gooey. [stretches the goo bubble]
",9
21801,Patrick,185," [shoves the goo bubble into his mouth; muffled] I can fit it in my mouth. Oh, it tastes like liquorice.
",9
21802,Squidward,185," [off-screen] You idiots! [the scene widens to show him] That goo is dangerous! Weren't you two morons listening?
",9
21803,Patrick,185," [muffled] No, not really. I drifted off.
",9
21804,SpongeBob,185," But just look at all the cool stuff it can do. [stretches the goo bubble and makes it into a form of a top hat] You can make a hat. [put it on his head and spreads the goo around his face] Or a beard.
",9
21805,Patrick,185," [Patrick wears the goo bubble on his head in a Elvis Presley hairstyle] Or an awesome toupée.
",9
21806,Squidward,185," Toupée? You mean hair? [grabs a goo bubble that is floating towards him and put it on his head. Then, he stretches it and makes it into hair] How do I look?
",9
21807,Sandy,185," What is wrong with you people?! That goo can destroy everything!
",9
21808,Patrick,185," [SpongeBob and his goo bubble are stuck on right side of Patrick's head] Seems safe to me.
",9
21809,Sandy,185," That's what they said about microwave ovens, dry cleaning, and corn dogs!
",9
21810,SpongeBob,185," See you later, Sandy.
",9
21811,Patrick,185," Yeah, these goo bubbles won't bounce themselves. 
",9
21812,Sandy,185," You have been warned! 
",9
21813,Sandals,185," Oh, man, where will we get another ball?
",9
21814,SpongeBob,185," Why not try a goo bubble? [He gives them the smaller goo bubble. He bounces away]
",9
21815,Pilar,185," Thanks. [the goo sticks to his fin] Hey, it sticks like glue! Go long! [Sandals runs off as Pilar throws the goo bubble. But since it was stuck to his fin, it sends him flying into the lagoon. He pops out] Awesome! I still got it! I wish I could swim. [sinks back in]
",9
21816,Thaddeus,185," [wipes his head] It's so hot. [SpongeBob and Patrick arrive, each on their goo bubble, and Patrick makes a beach umbrella out of a passing goo bubble that is smaller than then ones the two are sitting on] Oh, it's so cooling. [SpongeBob and Patrick bounce off] Thanks, goo!
",9
21817,Squidward,185," Thanks, goo!
",9
21818,Pilar,185," [under the lagoon] Thanks, goo!
",9
21819,"Tommy, Sadie, Orange fish from earlier, Billy, Nazz-Mimi, and Brown girl fish",185," Thanks, goo!
",9
21820,Johnny Erain,185," And now we go to Perch Perkins [The image of the Bikini Bottomites goes away and is replaced by Perch Perkins in front of some passing goo bubble while light green letters in the upper-left corner of the screen that read ""LIVE"" are shown] at the scene!
",9
21821,Perch Perkins,185," That's right! Perch Perkins here at Goo Lagoon, bringing you the latest on this Super Goo event. [walks up to SpongeBob] What do you think of Super Goo, young man?
",9
21822,SpongeBob,185," [He looks nervous for a second and remains silent for a moment until he looks at the camera. He smiles] I'm on TV!
",9
21823,Perch Perkins,185," [walks up to Patrick] And you, sir, what's your opinion? [Patrick doesn't say anything] Uh, sir?
",9
21824,Patrick,185," [grabs Perch's suit] It's awesome.
",9
21825,Perch Perkins,185," [chuckles nervously] That's great. Let's get some comments from some other beach goers. [Sandy runs up and grabs the microphone]
",9
21826,Perch Perkins,185," [angrily grabs his microphone back from Sandy] Yes, siree. The goo bubbles certainly are getting folks excited.
",9
21827,SpongeBob & Patrick,185," [bouncing on their goo bubbles] We sure are excited! [laugh]
",9
21828,Plankton,185," [continues his search for the crack formed from the super goo under the lagoon. He lets go of the yoke] I can't find this thing anywhere. [pulls out his binoculars and looks to the left of the vehicle] Come on, now. Think, Plankton. [he looks up] If you were a giant bubble of dangerous goo, where would you be? [he goes back to the left]
",9
21829,Karen,185," [pops up] Sheldon, this ship wasn't designed to reach these depths.
",9
21830,Plankton,185," That's great, sweetheart.
",9
21831,Karen,185," If you continue this search much longer, your power supply will deplete and you'll sink.
",9
21832,Plankton,185," All right, Karen. I'll make sure I write that down in my book, titled, Insignificant Things My Wife Told Me.
",9
21833,Karen,185," Whatever. Go get stuck at the bottom of Goo Lagoon. It's your funeral.
",9
21834,Plankton,185," What did you say?
",9
21835,Karen,185," I said, ""Go get stuck at the bottom of Goo Lagoon.""
",9
21836,Plankton,185," That's it, Karen! The goo bubble must be stuck at the bottom. We just have to get down there. Karen, cut the power to the entire ship. [Karen cuts the power and the ship starts sinking] Yes! [laughs evilly as his ship continues to sink until it finds the crack where the goo bubbles are coming from] Look, there it is! Karen, fire up the engine power. [Karen restarts the ship] With my mechanical clam digger, I'll crack open this goo-cano easy as a clam! Which is what it was built for, so... You know, that makes sense. [the ship lands into the crack as Plankton laughs evilly. Plankton pushes the button and the ship widens the crack] Yes! Yes! Bubble forth, my gooey wrath! [the lagoon floor begins to shake] And now to get the ding-dang out of here! [Plankton makes his getaway in his escape pod while the remains of his ship get swallowed up by the massive purple goo rising from the crack]
",9
21837,SpongeBob,185," Look! [a giant purple goo bubble forms out of the water] Giant goo bubble! [Sandy pops out from the sand under SpongeBob]
",9
21838,Sandy,185," See, I told ya! [breaths crazily] Run for your lives!
",9
21839,Patrick,185," Sandy's really getting out of hand. [cuts to black screen]
",9
21840,Perch Perkins,185," This is Perch Perkins reporting live from Goo Lagoon where I'm standing in front of what appears to be some sort of gigantic gooey bubble rising out of the water into the water. With me is Sandy Cheeks. Miss Cheeks, as Bikini Bottom's resident know-it-all, we look to you for answers. Who, what, how, why, when?
",9
21841,Sandy,185," Well, Perch, I won't really know anything until I run some tests but I can tell you it's pretty serious. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to get going. [reveals that Perch is sitting in the boat with her along with SpongeBob and Patrick]
",9
21842,Perch Perkins,185," Oh, yes. Of course. [Perch jumps into the water and pops up while his microphone is short circuiting] This is Perch Perkins and I'm soaking wet. Back to you.
",9
21843,SpongeBob,185," Wow, it's so big!
",9
21844,Sandy,185," That there is a Texas-sized bubble! [picks up one of the oars] First, we'll check its tensile strength. [taps on the bubble a few times] Tight as a drum.
",9
21845,Patrick,185," [takes the oar from Sandy] Oh, I want to play the drum! [attempts to hit it until Sandy grabs the oar]
",9
21846,Sandy,185," No, Patrick, don't! That thing's volatile! There's no telling what kind of damage it'll cause if it pops!
",9
21847,Patrick,185," Oh, fine. Here. I don't need that old stick anyways. [jumps into the bubble but bounces back causing him to crash into SpongeBob and fall in the water. Water splashes on Sandy's helmet]
",9
21848,Sandy,185," [pulls them out and back into the boat] Come on, guys. We still have more tests to perform. I need a sample. Be a darling and hand me that there bucket. [SpongeBob gets up and has a bucket stuck on his bottom. Patrick giggles at that as Sandy takes the bucket and grabs a bit of goo from the bubble] Ok, SpongeBob, put a little bit of that gloop into this analyzer. [SpongeBob pours the goo in the mouth of Sandy's analyzer. The analyzer scans the goo but goes haywire as a paper spits out] This is worse than I thought.
",9
21849,SpongeBob,185," Look, Sandy. [makes a painting of Sandy out of goo with Patrick and giggles with him]
",9
21850,Sandy,185," How many times do I have to tell you that stuff's dangerous? Now, how are y'all gonna clean that gunk off?
",9
21851,SpongeBob,185," [both SpongeBob and Patrick's hand are covered with goo] Oh, yeah. Gross. Good thing I keep a spare set of hands. [two extra hands pop out of his head, takes off the goo stained hands off, and throws them in the water]
",9
21852,Patrick,185," Oh, yeah! [Patrick rips his arm off but nothing happens]
",9
21853,SpongeBob,185," Uh, I have a better idea. [a bottle of bubbles pop out of his head and he mixes the soap with its wand] Hold out your hands. [blows bubbles on Patrick's hands and the bubbles clean the goo off]
",9
21854,Patrick,185," Oh, they shine!
",9
21855,Sandy,185," Well, it seems to have stabilized. As long as it doesn't get any bigger, there's not too much to worry about. [ground rumbles] That ain't good. [the force of the rumble causes a tidal wave which sends SpongeBob, Patrick, and Sandy flying while screaming and crashing onto the beach]
",9
21856,Perch Perkins,185," So, Miss Cheeks, what's the prognosis?
",9
21857,Sandy,185," Well, Perch, it's my considered opinion that now would be a good time to-- [ground rumbles] --run like heck! [everyone runs and screams]
",9
21858,Perch Perkins,185," [on tv] Well, there you have it. This is Perch Perkins about to be swallowed by a giant wave. [the wave crashes onto Perch and the TV goes into color bars screen. Everyone at Goo Lagoon is running for their lives and screaming as the giant goo bubble rolls on the beach.]
",9
21859,Patrick,185," [runs to an outhouse] I'll catch up! I've gotta use the can! [close the door until the giant goo bubble rolls onto it]
",9
21860,SpongeBob,185," [trips over a rock] Whoa! [lands on his head in the sand and Sandy pulls him out. The giant goo bubble almost rolls over SpongeBob and Sandy and begins to float in the air above them]
",9
21861,Sandy,185," Phew, that was a close one.
",9
21862,Patrick,185," Help, help! Help! [punches through the door] I'm out of toilet paper in here! [the outhouse begins to slide off]
",9
21863,SpongeBob,185," Look out! [SpongeBob and Sandy run as the outhouse crashes onto the ground. Patrick hangs on for his life but he begins to slip while some of the goo sticks on him. He screams. SpongeBob is reaching out for Patrick while Sandy is carrying him by the feet] Hang on, buddy! Just a little bit more! [grabs Patrick by his foot] Gotcha! [tries to pull him down but loses his grip] I don't gotcha! Whoa! [SpongeBob and Sandy fall over as Patrick, who is still stuck on the goo, stretches up as the goo detaches causing him to fall right on top of the goo bubble]
",9
21864,Patrick,185," Help! [sobs as the goo bubble drifts away]
",9
21865,SpongeBob,185," Now what do we do?
",9
21866,Sandy,185," We need to get to my submarine! Fast! [Squidward is seen riding on his recumbent bicycle until Sandy grabs him be the arms] Squidward, it's an emergency! I'm gonna need your bike! [Sandy lifts Squidward off his bike and gets on] Hop on, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob gets on and rides for a few seconds to Sandy's treedome. They get off and run inside]
",9
21867,Squidward,185," Sheesh, you'd think the sky was falling. [goo then splatters on top of Squidward] I am going to learn to keep my big mouth shut. [the goo bubble floats by the treedome as Patrick continues to scream until he begins to play with the goo. He then make a goo sculpture of SpongeBob]
",9
21868,Patrick,185," Howdy, SpongeBlob! I'm so glad you could stick around. [giggles] Glad. [SpongeBob and Sandy arrive in a submarine]
",9
21869,Sandy,185," [through her communicator] Hold on, Patrick! We're here to rescue you!
",9
21870,Patrick,185," Oh, go rescue somebody else. Can't you see I'm playing with my friend, SpongeBlob? [SpongeBob and Sandy look at each other in confusion. They fly above Patrick and release a grappling hook] Don't worry. I'll never leave you. [the hook grabs Patrick's head] Huh? [the hook pulls Patrick off the goo] No...! Good-bye, SpongeBlob! [Patrick gets pulled safely into the submarine as the hook left a dent on his head] Hi, SpongeBob! Hi, Sandy! [the goo bubble flies towards Bikini Bottom]
",9
21871,SpongeBob,185," So what do we do now, Sandy? That thing is headed straight for downtown Bikini Bottom.
",9
21872,Sandy,185," If that thing pops, we can kiss our beautiful town goodbye! [the townspeople takes Sandy's words too literally and starts to kiss the streets and the buildings and say goodbye to them. The goo bubble continues to fly above the city and rains goo on the townspeople and buildings. Everyone starts screaming. The bubble bends two skyscrapers. Cuts to the Bikini Bottom City Hall where a bride and a groom are getting married at the steps and the front door while everyone is cheering. A pile of goo splatters on top of the groom]
",9
21873,Groom,185," Help me, my beloved.
",9
21874,Bride,185," Don't touch me, you disgusting freak! [a drop of goo stains her wedding dress and she cries] My dress is ruined! [Sandy's sub flies underneath the bubble as it splatters goo on Nancy Suzy-Fish after she gasps]
",9
21875,Nancy's baby,185," [giggles] Mommy goopy! [goo splatters on Nancy's baby. Nancy runs away screaming with her baby while Tyler takes cover in a nearby trashcan. Once its safe, he sighs and climbs out covered in filth. The bubble continues to fly but this time towards the statue of King Neptune]
",9
21876,SpongeBob,185," Oh, no! It's headed right for Neptune's trident!
",9
21877,Sandy,185," I was afraid it might come to this. In order to save the city, we must destroy public property. [activates missiles at the bottom of her sub]
",9
21878,SpongeBob,185," Uh, Sandy, why do you have missiles in your sub?
",9
21879,Sandy,185," You know, in case I get stuck in traffic. Here goes! [pushes button and launches the missiles. The missiles make a direct hit on the statue, but they instead make it into a skeleton form] Darn it! [the goo bubble approaches and SpongeBob, Sandy, and Patrick scream. However, the bubble flies above the statue] Huh? What the--?
",9
21880,SpongeBob,185," That's weird. It's like that bubble has a mind of its own.
",9
21881,Sandy,185," Or the mind of someone else. Look! [it is revealed that Plankton has been moving the bubble by pushing it from behind while he is inside the escape pod. He sighs] Plankton! I knew it!
",9
21882,Plankton,185," Yeah, it's me.
",9
21883,Sandy,185," What are y'all up to this time?
",9
21884,Plankton,185," Well, that's for me to know and for you to clam up!
",9
21885,SpongeBob,185," [gasps] Rude!
",9
21886,Plankton,185," Let's just say I've got big plans for this little bubble. [laughs evilly as SpongeBob, Sandy, and Patrick stare at him in disgust] Now, if you'll excuse me I have to go. [proceeds in pushing the goo bubble. SpongeBob, Sandy, and Patrick pursue him until he activates a continuous track on his escape pod. They continue to chase him around the bubble until Plankton laughs and speeds up]
",9
21887,Sandy,185," Dang it! We'll never catch him at this rate!
",9
21888,Plankton,185," Ha! They'll never catch me at this rate! [yelps as he sees Sandy, SpongeBob, and Patrick coming towards him at the front]
",9
21889,Sandy,185," [comes out of her sub] Oh, no, you don't! [throws a lasso on Plankton's pod and ties the rope on the hook] Come here, you little varmint! You stay right there! Yippee! We got him now! [Sandy, SpongeBob and Patrick jump out and run towards him]
",9
21890,Plankton,185," That's right, come to Papa.
",9
21891,Sandy,185," When we get you out of there, you've got some explaining to do!
",9
21892,Patrick,185," [runs past SpongeBlob] Hey again, SpongeBlob!
",9
21893,Sandy,185," We've got you surrounded, Plankton! Now, come out with your antenna in the air!
",9
21894,Plankton,185," Oh, dear, I guess you've got me. Oh, wait a second-- [pushes a red button] No, you don't! [Plankton's pod flies off]
",9
21895,Sandy,185," Retreat! Retreat!
",9
21896,Plankton,185," Aw, don't go so soon. [pushes a yellow button. The pod activates a giant plug] I hope you brought your dancing shoes! [the plug stabs on the bubble cornering SpongeBob, Patrick, and Sandy] 'Cause it's time to do the electric goo-boogaloo! [pushes a green button and the plug electrocutes SpongeBob, Sandy, and Patrick which causes the townspeople below to scream in fear as Plankton laughs evilly. SpongeBob, Patrick and Sandy are fried and Plankton pushes them off with the wind from his pod's rudder. As they fall, he continues to push the bubble. SpongeBob, Patrick, and Sandy fall and scream until they crash to the ground]
",9
21897,Patrick,185," [Patrick and Sandy are shown to be unharmed from the impact of the fall] Good thing we landed on SpongeBob. [it reveals that SpongeBob's spongy body saved them but SpongeBob is squashed under them]
",9
21898,SpongeBob,185," Yeah, good thing. [Sandy jumps off]
",9
21899,Sandy,185," Plankton, you creepy bacteria! Give me back my sub! [Plankton throws Sandy's sub at them as it crashes to the ground. Sandy gasps] My sub!
",9
21900,SpongeBob,185," There, there Sandy.
",9
21901,Patrick,185," Plankton, you're-- you're a big meanie-weenie! You won't be such a tough guy without that big old bubble!
",9
21902,SpongeBob,185," Tough guy? Bubble? Patrick! Eureka! Inspiration!
",9
21903,Patrick,185," Really? [smells his armpit] Do I need deodorant?
",9
21904,SpongeBob,185," No, but you're close. What we need is [pulls out his bubble bottle from his head] liquid soap. It's time to fight bubble with bubble!
",9
21905,Patrick,185," [scoffs] Bubbles. That's your answer for everything. [cuts to the Krusty Krab]
",9
21906,Mr. Krabs,185," Thank you, come again! [goo splatters onto Mr. Krabs' eyes] Hey, who turned out the lights? [wipes off the goo and looks up to see the giant goo bubble in front of his restaurant]
",9
21907,Plankton,185," Hello, down there, Krabs! Look, I brought you a pretty balloon! And in return, you can give me the Krabby Patty secret formula!
",9
21908,Mr. Krabs,185," Why in the world would I want to do that?
",9
21909,Plankton,185," Cause if you don't, [his pod pulls out a needle] I'm gonna pop this disgusting thing and destroy Bikini Bottom! [then his pod holds out his computer with the picture of the Krusty Krab and Bikini Bottom on it] As you can see, I projected the blast radius of this goo-bomic balloon and it's gonna cover pretty much everything in town.
",9
21910,Mr. Krabs,185," Oh, yeah? Well, I can't see nothing from down here!
",9
21911,Plankton,185," Oh, yeah? Well, look again, you dingus! [throws his computer down at Mr. Krabs]
",9
21912,Mr. Krabs,185," I won't be blackmailed! There's no way I'm giving you me secret formula!
",9
21913,Plankton,185," You heard him, Bikini Bottom! It's time to kiss clean goodbye! [prepares to pop the goo bubble as he laughs evilly, but is stopped by SpongeBob's voice]
",9
21914,SpongeBob,185," [standing on the Krusty Krab sign] Hey, you! Yeah, you! Hold it right there, mister!
",9
21915,Plankton,185," Eh, not again.
",9
21916,SpongeBob,185," Prepare to meet your match, you big, bubble bully! [Sandy is standing on the bubble bottle and stirs the liquid soap with a giant bubble wand]
",9
21917,Plankton,185," [his pod puts its needle away on its head] Well, this is interesting. Let's see where it goes.
",9
21918,Sandy,185," Thank Neptune for the Barg'N-Mart buck discount! [gives SpongeBob the giant bubble wand]
",9
21919,SpongeBob,185," Here goes. [jumps off the sign] Geroni-blow! [the bubble wand creates a big bubble which takes the form of a bubble giant] Pretty slick, huh? Get him! [the bubble giant runs towards Plankton]
",9
21920,Plankton,185," [gasps] Uh-oh.
",9
21921,Patrick,185," [slides down the pole] Whoo! [laughs] Oh, boy! Get him, you big bubble bruiser! [runs up in the middle of the confrontation] Whoo! [laughs] You're the man! Yay! [the bubble giant steps on Patrick's pointy head and begins to deflate and fly around]
",9
21922,Plankton,185," Okay, where were we? Oh, yeah! [grabs the needle and proceeds but the deflating bubble giant flies under and lifts the goo bubble higher and higher]
",9
21923,SpongeBob,185," There goes a real hero. He gave his life so we could stay clean. [the bubble giant lifts the goo bubble so high that it flies out of the ocean and into outer space. The bubble giant begins to evaporate as Plankton's face gets distorted a little while he grunts until he reaches space. The goo bubble bounces on the moon and hurdles back to Earth and into the ocean] Oh, no, he's coming back!
",9
21924,Sandy,185," And he's headin' right for us! [Plankton parachutes the bubble safely and slowly to the ground. The townspeople flee as SpongeBob, Patrick, Sandy and Mr. Krabs scream until the bubble stops on top of them]
",9
21925,Plankton,185," That's it, no more messing around! Give me that formula or I'll destroy this stinkin' town! [hold out the needle]
",9
21926,Mr. Krabs,185," But I don't wanna!
",9
21927,Nat Peterson,185," You'd better do what he says or we'll tear your restaurant apart and give it to him ourselves!

21928,Bill,185," Yeah!

21929,Martha Smith,185," I just washed my car!
",9
21930,Bill,185," Yeah!
",9
21931,Mr. Krabs,185," [growls] Ok, I'll do it.
",9
21932,Bill,185," Yeah! [Martha and Nat look at him strangely as Mr. Krabs goes into his restaurant and gets the bottle containing the secret formula]
",9
21933,Mr. Krabs,185," [hands Plankton the bottle] Here. I hope you choke on it.
",9
21934,Plankton,185," [retrieves the formula from Mr. Krabs and opens his window] I can't believe it! After all these years, it's mine! [cries tears of joy and wipes a tear away] I'm so happy, I could just burst! This bubble that is! [everyone gasps and Plankton ruthlessly pops the bubble and the town is covered in purple goo as he laughs evilly. Everyone including SpongeBob, Patrick, Sandy, and Mr. Krabs are covered in goo]
",9
21935,SpongeBob,185," Oh, that dirty little double-timer!
",9
21936,Mr. Krabs,185," Don't worry. He's about to get what's coming to him.
",9
21937,Sandy,185," [annoyed] Well, I don't see what you're so gull darn happy about! This is a catastrophe!
",9
21938,SpongeBob,185," [stands there watching with Patrick and Sandy, still covered in goo. He and Patrick look happy but Sandy looks confused] See, Patrick? Bubbles are the answer to everything! [laughs as episode ends]",9

",9
21996,SpongeBob,186," Mr. Krabs? Are you okay?

21997,Mr. Krabs,186," I'm fine boy! In fact, I'm dancing with a beautiful lady.

21999,Mr. Krabs,186," Yes, and she's made entirely out of money.
",9
22000,SpongeBob,186," What? Where are you?
",9
22001,Mr. Krabs,186," I'm locked in the bank vault, and having the time of me life. Oh, and I think I'm running out of oxygen, and it's making me lose me mind.
",9
22002,SpongeBob,186," I gotta save Mr. Krabs! [runs to Patrick's house] Patrick! Patrick, you gotta help me, buddy! I need to break into a bank! [Patrick stops drinking his water, gags, and spits it back on SpongeBob]]
",9
22003,Patrick,186," What?! SpongeBob SquarePants, we have been friends for a long time, and you've asked me to do some crazy things over the years. Breaking into a bank? [SpongeBob looks ashamed] Has to be the coolest!
",9
22004,Mr. Krabs,186," [at the bank] Ah. This is the life. [imagines a beach] Sun, sand, and surf. And of course. Mrs. Greenback by my side. What's that? Eh, don't start on me now. I'm sure this remote island has a food source! Krabs just hasn't found it yet, that's all. I'll just… eh. Heh heh. So hungry.
",9
22005,SpongeBob,186," [outside the bank] Coast is clear! What's the plan, buddy?
",9
22006,Patrick,186," Okay. First we climb up the walls. [points up] Then, we slide down the chimney and eat up all the milk and cookies they left out for us!
",9
22007,SpongeBob,186," Well, I don't see a chimney. But we could try getting in through a roof vent. If only we had a way to scale this wall.
",9
22008,Patrick,186," Luckily, I brought the bank breaking kit! Um. How about this? [holds out several shoelaces]
",9
22009,SpongeBob,186," A bunch of old shoelaces?
",9
22010,Patrick,186," It's as close as I'll ever get to having shoes.
",9
22011,SpongeBob,186," I wish we had something stronger. But this'll have to do. [throws shoelaces up, they catch a pipe, and hold. The shoelaces continue to untie, and SpongeBob jumps to catch each one]
",9
22012,Patrick,186," Hey, SpongeBob! I got an idea! Let's use this grappling hook! [throws the grappling hook up, it catches. SpongeBob climbs up, while Patrick piggybacks. They tiptoe across the roof]
",9
22013,SpongeBob,186," This vent will surely lead us to Mr. Krabs!
",9
22014,Patrick,186," Let's get him! [the two jump into the vent, and bump all around the bank, then underground, and then through another building. They land on the ground in front of the bank.] COOL! Let's do that again!
",9
22015,SpongeBob,186," Not now, Patrick. We're running out of time. And more importantly, Mr. Krabs is running out of oxygen.
",9
22016,Mr. Krabs,186," [inside the imaginary island, it's on fire] Ohhh! So hungry! [stomach growls] Oh, why did I come to this uninhabitable island? Why did I do it? Why did I say all that to Mrs. Greenback? I miss her… why isn't she? Miss Greenback! Where could she be? What have I done? [sees Greenback on the beach] Ms. Greenback! Oh, Ms. Greenback. [picks her up] You're okay! I was so worried. [mumbles, and rubs Greenback. As he rubs, all the money composing Mrs. Greenback flies away] What's this?!! Ah! Little miss! What the Neptune?!! [sees money dragon] A slimy money dragon! You're not sucking away me fortune without a fight! [attacks, and comes back to the real vault, shows he is attacking a a vacuum cleaner] Gimme back Mrs. Greenback you beast!
",9
22017,SpongeBob,186," [outside the front doors to the bank] Patrick, you ready?
",9
22018,Patrick,186," This lock won't know what hit it! [sticks screwdriver into the lock]
",9
22019,SpongeBob,186," Ah, careful Patrick. Use finesse.
",9
22020,Patrick,186," Oh, right! [pulls out a crowbar] I'll use the finesse. [swings, and SpongeBob ducks. Closed signs switches to open, and they fall through the doors to the foot of the bank manger]
",9
22021,Bank Manager,186," Good morning, gentlemen. [SpongeBob and Patrick scream]
",9
22022,Patrick,186," We've been rumbled! Run! Scatter! Scamper! Save yourself!
",9
22023,Bank Manager,186," What's all this about? [walks backwards to alarm button, SpongeBob pulls off ski mask.] May I help you with anything, sir?
",9
22024,SpongeBob,186," Ah. Yes, I need to make a withdrawal. I need to withdraw one Mister Krabs!
",9
22025,Bank Manager,186," I assure you, Mr. SquarePants, we've received no such deposit. [opens vault]
",9
22026,Mr. Krabs,186," I got you now, money sucker! That is it, you nimbrid! It's you, or me now! Just you and me! [wrestles the vacuum, and breaks it. Laughs evilly] I concurred the money dragon! It's history! Woo hoo!
",9
22027,Bank Manger,186," Security! [security throws them out] And don't forget your… eh… deposit. [tosses penny at Mr. Krabs]
",9
22028,Mr. Krabs,186," You know, boyo. Through this whole ordeal, I've learned a little something about greed. A little something about isolation. Heh. Even a little something about love. And you know what I realized through it all?
",9
22029,SpongeBob,186," That you can't put a price on freedom?
",9
22030,Mr. Krabs,186," Barnacles no, boy! I realized that they didn't pay interest on me deposit! [shakes fist] Hey, you cheapskates! Gimme me interest! [penny is thrown at Mr. Krabs] Well. What do you know? I doubled me money. [laughs as the episode ends]",9

22097,SpongeBob & Patrick,187,"  [scream] The Fisherman! [they have ran into a cardboard cutout of the Fisherman with the title of the movie beside it. They run out of the Reef Cinemas screaming] ''[the clock tolls, meaning that it's midnight. A little cardboard cutout of the Fisherman comes out of the clock and lowers his cardboard hook and catches a cardboard fish. It goes back in the clock] It's midnight! The Fisherman! [run to SpongeBob's door]
",9
22098,SpongeBob,187," Phew. We made it.
",9
22099,Patrick,187," I guess we showed that old horror movie who's boss.
",9
22100,SpongeBob,187," Yeah. We looked fear right in the face and... avoided direct eye contact.
",9
22101,Patrick,187," It's like we're heroes.
",9
22102,SpongeBob,187," Okay, buddy. Sleep tight. I'll see you tomorrow.
",9
22103,Patrick,187," Wait a second. Y-You mean, I gotta walk all the way home alone?
",9
22104,SpongeBob,187," No. No, you don't. I'm gonna walk you to your door. [starts walking Patrick to his door]
",9
22105,Patrick,187," Darn old horror movie. Why couldn't we watch a cartoon instead? [foghorn blows] Do you hear that?
",9
22106,SpongeBob,187," [whispering] I think it's coming from over there. [points to fog. A shadow comes behind it] 
",9
22107,SpongeBob & Patrick,187," It's the Fisherman! [scream and hide behind Patrick's rock; Slasher McGee passes by on a small bike with training wheels]
",9
22108,SpongeBob,187," Oh, it's just Slasher McGee. Okay, I guess I'll just go home now. It's right over there. [tries to move but doesn't] Just a few steps that away. [tries again but fails] In the dark? All alone?
",9
22109,Patrick,187," Oh, okay-kay, come on now, don't be all scared. I'll walk you home. [starts walking SpongeBob home]
",9
22110,SpongeBob,187," Aw, thanks, old pal. But then, who's gonna walk you home?
",9
22111,Patrick,187," Let's just cross that bridge when we burn it. [a shadow comes over them. Behind the fog there is a shadow of the Fisherman] 
",9
22112,SpongeBob and Patrick,187," The Fisherman! [scream but then notice that the shadow is actually of jellyfish who had formed a shadow of the Fisherman. SpongeBob and Patrick continue screaming. Squidward wakes up and growls. He gets out of bed. SpongeBob and Patrick run around screaming but stop and pant]
",9
22113,Squidward,187," What is wrong with you?! [SpongeBob and Patrick scream and jump to Squidward's windows. They shiver]
",9
22114,SpongeBob,187," Oh, hey, Squidward.
",9
22115,Squidward,187," What are you blockheads up to? Don't you know it's after midnight? Get down here!
",9
22116,Patrick,187," We can't get home.
",9
22117,SpongeBob,187," We're too scared. [Squidward growls. Scene changes to Squidward walking to Patrick's rock with SpongeBob on his head wearing his nightcap and Patrick holding onto him]
",9
22118,SpongeBob,187," [sighs] Thank you, Squidward. You are a true friend. [Squidward opens Patrick's rock with his  left foot and throws Patrick in]
",9
22119,Patrick,187," Thanks, Squidwar... [Squidward closes his rock and grumbles. He walks over to Spongebob's house]
",9
22120,SpongeBob,187," Yeah, thanks, Squidward. I don't think we would've ever gotten home with you.
",9
22121,Squidward,187," Hat.
",9
22122,SpongeBob,187," Oh, yeah. Here. [gives Squidward's nightcap back. Squidward pulls SpongeBob's legs, which shoots him through his mail slot and into his bed]
",9
22123,Squidward,187," I told those muttonheads not to see that movie. [walks into his house]
",9
22124,SpongeBob,187," Patrick! Are you okay?
",9
22125,Patrick,187," Yeah! Are you okay?
",9
22126,SpongeBob,187," I think so! Goodnight!
",9
22127,Patrick,187," Yeah., goodnight! Just don't think about the Fisherman!
",9
22128,SpongeBob,187," Oh, no, I will not think about the Fisherman! Sleep tight!
",9
22129,Squidward,187," Oh, ""The Fisherman."" ""The Fisherman."" Blah, blah, blah. They want a Fisherman, eh? I'll give them a Fisherman! And how! [goes to his closet and turns on the light. He pulls out a vampire costume] No. [pulls out a Frankenstein costume] No. [pulls out an Easter Bunny costume] Um... no. [pulls out a fisherman's hat and coat] Aha! [lightning strikes. Squidward is outside and has the coat on] It's time for those lame-brains to meet the real Fisherman. [puts on the hat with a beard attached to it. Lightning strikes again as Squidward lowers the hook from the fishing rod] This is gonna be good. [laughs. Lightning strikes again. Squidward is in a boat on the roof of his house his hook at Patrick's rock, scrapes it, and opens it a little four times. Patrick wakes up and opens his rock with his head]
",9
22130,Patrick,187," Uh, hello? Someone there? [the hook hooks under his left nostril] Uh, uh? What's that? [stammers] There's something stuck... [grunts] Huh. [the hook starts pulling it] Oh, wait a second. Oh, yeah. That's the spot. A little to the left. [drools] Oh, yeah. All right. Right there. [laughs. Squidward laughs and pulls the hook]
",9
22131,Squidward,187," Gotcha! [the hook pulls Patrick out of his rock]
",9
22132,Patrick,187," [screams as he sees Squidward] The Fisherman! [screams and runs]
",9
22133,Squidward,187," Maybe this wasn't such a good idea. [the rod goes after Patrick and starts to pull Squidward and the boat with it; Squidward screams; the boat rides up Patrick's open rock and soars in the air. Patrick screams twice while Squidward starts laughing. He runs to SpongeBob's house, pulls his door open, goes inside, and closes the door causing Squidward to smash into the door. Patrick sees Squidward outside, laughing. Patrick runs, with his face ripped off from the hook, he runs up to SpongeBob's bedroom] SpongeBob! Get up! He's here!
",9
22134,SpongeBob,187," Who's here? Hold on, let me get up. [scream] Your face!
",9
22135,Patrick,187," Oh. [takes his head and stretches it, making his face whole again] There.
",9
22136,SpongeBob,187," Now who's here?
",9
22137,Patrick,187," Uh, someone's here?
",9
22138,SpongeBob,187," You just said.
",9
22139,Patrick,187," Oh. The Fisherman's here.
",9
22140,SpongeBob,187," The Fisherman!
",9
22141,Patrick,187," The Fisherman!
",9
22142,SpongeBob & Patrick,187," [scream and run in circles on SpongeBob's bed]
",9
22143,Squidward,187," Ha Ha Ha Ha. This is the most perfect. What a couple of hopeless babies. I really should stop. But I’m having too much fun. (goes in SpongeBob's house) Ha. It's almost too easy.
",9
22144,SpongeBob,187," Quick. Block the door.
",9
22145,Squidward,187," There's just no sport in it.
",9
22146,SpongeBob,187," (SpongeBob & Patrick push stuff over to SpongeBob bedroom door) Get everything?
",9
22147,Patrick,187," What about this? (Patrick holds Gary)
",9
22148,SpongeBob,187," Not Gary. Think it'll hold?
",9
22149,Patrick,187," I sure hope so. (SpongeBob and Patrick look into window and sees Squidward, laughing)
",9
22150,SpongeBob & Patrick,187," (scream as Squidward opens the window and then scream again)
",9
22151,Patrick,187," Maybe if we don't look at him he'll go away.
",9
22152,SpongeBob,187," Oh yeah. Just like the movie. (they close their eyes, later open them to see Squidward behind them)
",9
22153,Squidward,187," I'm the Deadly Fisherman!
",9
22154,SpongeBob & Patrick,187,"  (scream)
",9
22155,SpongeBob,187," I guess this is the end, old buddy.
",9
22156,Patrick,187," I don't want to die in my underwear!
",9
22157,SpongeBob,187," Here. (SpongeBob takes off his underwear) Die in mine.
",9
22158,Patrick,187," Hey. Good idea. Let's trade. (Patrick takes off his underwear) Here you go.
",9
22159,SpongeBob,187," And here you go. (SpongeBob and Patrick trade underwears and puts on their underwears) Now where were we? Oh, yeah.
",9
22160,SpongeBob & Patrick,187," [screams] He's gonna turn us into fish sticks!
",9
22161,Squidward,187," [laughing]
",9
22162,SpongeBob & Patrick,187,"  (scream)
",9
22163,SpongeBob,187," That thing's eating Squidward!
",9
22164,Patrick,187," Not our bestest buddy! We gotta save him! Okay, with 33. I need you to go long. You're going down, Fisherman!
",9
22165,SpongeBob,187," Don't worry, Squidward. We'll get you out of that old monster. Let's get to the window. (Patrick throws heavy objects onto Squidward) Okay! I think you got it! (Sirens) (Squidward grumbles) There, there, no need to digest. We're only doing what friends to for the bestest buddy. We don't have to be afraid of that old monster anymore.
",9
22166,Squidward,187," Huh?
",9
22167,SpongeBob & Patrick,187," (scream and run into ambulance) (Costume falls down, revealing Gary)

22176,Squidward,188," Keep that up and you'll lose consciousness. [under his breath] Tentacles crossed.
",9
22177,SpongeBob,188," [trying to hold his breath as his face turns blue] Silly Squidward. I'm not going to-- [loses consciousness as Mr. Krabs bursts in the kitchen]
",9
22178,Mr. Krabs,188," What's going on around here? [notices SpongeBob lying unconscious on the kitchen floor. He takes out the bottle containing the secret formula and the smell of it revives him. SpongeBob wakes up]
",9
22179,SpongeBob [speaking gibberish],188," What's going on?
",9
22180,Mr. Krabs,188," Well, I could be asking you the same thing, boy.
",9
22181,SpongeBob,188," Sorry, Mr. Krabs. I was merely emulating my latest media obsession... [points to a poster saying ""KENNY! The Cat"" with a picture of Kenny on it] ♪ Kenny the Cat ♪
",9
22182,Mr. Krabs,188," Kenny the Cat? What in clams' name is a... ""the cat""?
",9
22183,Mr. Krabs,188," No.
",9
22184,SpongeBob,188," [runs up to a huge collection of magazines with Kenny the Cat on them] And you haven't perused my collection of Kenny the Cat periodicals? [turns on the tv] Or noticed Kenny on every TV channel known to fishkind?
",9
22185,Mr. Krabs,188," Uh, no.
",9
22186,SpongeBob,188," [opens the door and a blimp shaped in the head of Kenny the Cat is flying] But what about the Kenny the Cat blimp which hovers over Kenny the Cat Sports Stadium?
",9
22187,Mr. Krabs,188," Never noticed it. [walks away, unimpressed]

",9
22190,SpongeBob,188," Oh, he's on all the new $50 bills.
",9
22191,Mr. Krabs,188," Oh, that Kenny the Cat. Well, he's a sensationality.
",9
22192,SpongeBob,188," Yeah! And he's visiting Bikini Bottom tomorrow with hundreds of his rabidly, loyal fans.
",9
22193,Mr. Krabs,188," Hundreds, you say?
",9
22194,SpongeBob,188," Maybe even a thousand! [Mr. Krabs poses himself as a dollar sign in joy and triumph]

22196,SpongeBob,188," I shall do my Krustiest, sir. [cuts to SpongeBob visiting Sandy's treedome but with no water helmet]
",9
22197,Sandy,188," [notices SpongeBob not wearing a water helmet and gasps in horror of his safety] SpongeBob, don't you want your water helmet? [tries to give him one as SpongeBob walks in holding his breath]
",9
22198,SpongeBob,188," [laughs] Not necessary, Sandy. Like my personal hero, Kenny the Cat, I'm A-ok. [SpongeBob makes an A-ok hand-gesture. He suddenly dries up and falls flat on the grass]
",9
22199,Sandy,188," [sprays water on SpongeBob with a hose] Well, if you ain't going to use your helmet, I suggest you make it quick, SpongeBob.
",9
22200,SpongeBob,188," [restores to normal] Hey, Sandy, you're kinda like a cat, aren't you?
",9
22201,Sandy,188," [flips her head upside-down in disbelief] Cat?! [turns her head rightside-up] In what way am I kind of like a cat?
",9
22202,SpongeBob,188," Well, aren't cats and squirrels basically the same thing?
",9
22203,Sandy,188," We are both mammals, but that is where the similarities end. Cats are no good scoundrels and I ain't never trusting one of them!
",9
22204,SpongeBob,188," Well, you can trust Kenny the-. He's the heroic cat who has been holding his breath for days at a time.
",9
22205,Sandy,188," [continues to spray water on SpongeBob with her hose] I hate to precipitate on your party, SpongeBob, but that is impossible. No air breather could ever do that. Not even me! [quivers in fear]
",9
22206,SpongeBob,188," Very well, Sandra. If that is your stance, then so be it. Could ""someone"" be jealous of Kenny's dazzling lung capacity? [cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick in sleeping bags, and wearing foam hands on the street waiting for Kenny the Cat]
",9
22207,SpongeBob & Patrick,188," Kenny the Cat! Kenny the Cat! Kenny the Cat! [Nat Peterson walks by]
",9
22208,SpongeBob,188," Uh-huh.
",9
22209,Nat Peterson,188," Tomorrow morning.
",9
22210,SpongeBob,188," Uh-huh, yeah. 14 hours is cutting it close but I had to work all day.
",9
22211,Nat Peterson,188," Hopeless. [walks away]
",9
22212,SpongeBob,188," You know, I read in Kenny Fancy Magazine that he's so used to holding his breath that when he's topside, he forgets to breathe.
",9
22213,Patrick,188," Wow! [laughs] Oh, that'd be like me forgetting to-- [panicking] Oh! Oh, oh, oh...[takes out a taco from his pocket] Oh, there you are, pocket taco. [eats it]
",9
22214,SpongeBob,188," [sighs] Patrick, have you ever gazed up into the starry night and see Kenny the Cat's face?
",9
22215,Patrick,188," No.
",9
22216,SpongeBob,188," [makes shapes with his fingers like he's connecting the dots] Find the goober constellation and the dorsal constellation, then squint your eyes and let the details fall into place. [a picture of Kenny the Cat is seen in the starry sky]
",9
22217,Patrick,188," [tries to see it but can't] Uh... Nope, I don't see it. Kenny's really gotten into your head lately.
",9
22218,SpongeBob,188," Yeah, Kenny's awesome. Hey, that reminds me! [takes out his make-up kit] Let's paint our faces to look like Kenny! [puts make-up on Patrick's face] Perfect! [Patrick's face is painted in a really ugly looking design of Kenny the Cat] We're the biggest Kenny the Cat fans ever!
",9
22219,Patrick,188," [Patrick looks at himself in the mirror] This, uh, is getting creepy.
",9
22220,SpongeBob,188," [paints a nasty looking cat face on himself] Hey, buddy. Check it out.
",9
22221,Patrick,188," [SpongeBob's make-up scares Patrick] Sweet Neptune! Uh, SpongeBob, uh, I'm going to go now. Your obsession with Kenny is getting weird.
",9
22222,SpongeBob,188," But you didn't even get to see my new Kenny the Cat temporary tattoo. [pulls down his pants and shows Patrick his tattoo]
",9
22223,Patrick,188," Oh, that's okay. See you, SpongeBob! [runs away completely freaked out]
",9
22224,Announcer,188," Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time you've all been waiting for. Kenny the Cat will do his signature walk. [Kenny comes down the street, photographers take pictures]
",9
22225,SpongeBob,188," [head turns into the shape of a heart] Kenny!
",9
22226,Harold,188," Thanks, Kenny! [Kenny signs his fin]
",9
22227,SpongeBob,188," Kenny, sir, it would mean a lot if you'd sign my official Kenny the Cat spatula. [Kenny signs spatula] Thanks, Kenny. You're so real. [Kenny nods in agreement] Oh, you're hungry? What do you say we move this autograph session to the Krusty Krab? [Kenny gives him his A-ok handsign. SpongeBob stutters] Did you see that?! Kenny just gave me his trademark A-ok handsign! [does a silly dance] Swoon! Swoon! [cut to the Krusty Krab where a huge crowd is in front of it]
",9
22228,Crowd,188," [random chatter]
",9
22229,Mr. Krabs,188," One at a time, one at a time, please! Kenny the Cat will have time to meet each and every one of you's. [quietly] And I will have time to take each and every one of your dollars. [normal voice; shocked] Look at myself. I'm not being a very good host. [goes to Kenny Uh, excuse me. You just make yourself at home, Kenny. I mean, Mr. the Cat. [takes out two ketchup packets and one mustard packet] Here you go! Condiments. On the house. Don't tell anybody. Welcome to the Krusty Krab family. [laughs]
",9
22230,SpongeBob,188," Mr. the Cat? Everything OK? [Kenny draws a toilet and shows it to him] Say, Mr. Krabs, this is gonna be a long day for Kenny. How about we give him a minute to freshen up?
",9
22231,Mr. Krabs,188," What an excellent idea, SpongeBob! ""A clean cat is a moneymaking cat,"" I always say. Please [indistinct] yourself of the lounge facilities. [Kenny goes to the washroom]
",9
22232,SpongeBob,188," Well, I'd best get back manning the grill.
",9
22233,Kenny,188," [takes out the oxygen tank and throws it on the ground] This gets real uncomfortable after a while. [breathes in. His face turns blue. He runs to the oxygen tank] 
",9
22234,SpongeBob,188," [enters the bathroom with a Krabby Patty on a plate] Sorry to bother you, Mr. the Cat, but I thought you'd just like a bite to… [drops the patty] Whoa!
",9
22235,Kenny,188," [breathes through the oxygen tank and sighs. SpongeBob starts to panic] Good thing I've got this oxygen tank and mask, or otherwise there's no way I'd be able to hold my breath for this long.
",9
22236,SpongeBob,188," [camera zooms in to his heart which has a face. It loses a tooth and eye, then breaks] How could you, Kenny?! You broke my heart! Here I was this entire time believing your act, only to discover that it was nothing but... an act!
",9
22237,Kenny,188," But it's not what you think!
",9
22238,SpongeBob,188," There's no room for thoughts now. Only for tears. [runs away, sobbing]
",9
22239,Kenny,188," SpongeBob, wait! [trips over the oxygen tank, and uses it again]
",9
22240,SpongeBob,188," All right, Kenny, all right. I promise I won't tell anyone.
",9
22241,Kenny,188," Really?
",9
22242,SpongeBob,188," Yes, really. 
",9
22243,Kenny,188," All right! Thanks, Bob. You're the best friend I ever had! Now if you'll excuse moi, I've got to sign some autographs. [exits the kitchen]
",9
22244,Mr. Krabs,188," Ah, the cat of the hour is back!
",9
22245,Crowd,188," [cheering]
",9
22246,Mr. Krabs,188," All right, you ready to sign for these fine dollars—I mean, uh, suckers—I mean, uh, some autographs? [Kenny nods his head]
",9
22247,Crowd,188," [cheering]
",9
22248,Mr. Krabs,188," Well, alrighty then. That's what the consuming public wants to hear.
",9
22249,Billy Fishbowl,188," Sir, I just want to say that you're the biggest inspiration myself and my friends have ever known. Your ability to hold your breath changed our lives... forever. [looks at his three friends. They are holding their breath while their faces turn purple. One of them falls down]
",9
22250,SpongeBob,188," [looks worried. He reads the note that Kenny wrote] ""You're welcome. I've been holding my breath for more than 20 years, no problem."" [gulps] ""You can too. Signed, Kenny the Breath-Holding Cat""?
",9
22251,Sandy,188," Hiya, Kenny. Mind if I get your signature? [Kenny writes the signature] Gee, it sure is nice to meet another air-breathing, warm-blooded varmit down here.
",9
22252,Kenny,188," Mm-hmm.
",9
22253,Sandy,188," Just out of scientific curiosity, how do you hold your breath for so long? [SpongeBob and Kenny react]
",9
22254,SpongeBob,188," [laughs nervously] Uh, we needn't burden ourselves with such needless scientific technicalities, Sandy.
",9
22255,Sandy,188," I'm just wondering, SpongeBob. I mean, he does defy all scientific logic, [Kenny starts to sweat] considering the fact that all air breathing mammals need oxygen to the brain and lungs to survive for more than 3 minutes. [Sandy makes a serious face at Kenny. SpongeBob pushes her]
",9
22256,SpongeBob,188," Hey, maybe we should show our fine guest a little more hospitality, hmm?
",9
22257,Sandy,188," [pushes him back] What has gotten into you, SpongeBob? Can't I talk about what must surely be happening from a biological standpoint? I mean, like the lack of oxygen will heighten the capillaries in the lungs, causing a dangerous level of carbon monoxide to rise in the bloodstream, which in turn leads to a ghostly blue color to the skin, [Kenny's skin turns blue] followed by eventual unconsciousness.
",9
22258,Kenny [screaming],188," I can't take it! I need oxygen! [punches himself for his oxygen tank]
",9
22259,Crowd,188," [gasps]
",9
22260,Kenny,188," [uses the oxygen tank and sighs]
",9
22261,Sandy,188," I knew Kenny was a fake! 
",9
22262,Crowd,188," [boos and leaves]
",9
22263,Crowd Member,188," Liar!
",9
22264,Mr. Krabs,188," No! Come back! [to Kenny] Aw, thanks a lot, you air-breathing charlatan! And you can forget about these free condiments too! [takes back the condiments he gave Kenny. Cut to outside]
",9
22265,SpongeBob,188," Gee, Kenny, I sure am sorry if I ruined your career.
",9
22266,Kenny,188," [in a suit like Sandy's] Aww. It's okay, SpongeBob. Maybe the whole shamble is a big wake-up call to be honest. 
",9
22267,SpongeBob,188," Hey, I've got an idea. Most cats hate water, right? Well, you can be the cat that likes water. That way, you're still special.
",9
22268,Kenny,188," I like it! [does the A-ok handsign. SpongeBob does it back]
",9
22269,Sandy,188," Just get out of here already. [pops part of his suit, and he is rocketed back to the surface] You can never trust a cat. Or is it a dog?",9

22276,SpongeBob,189," Ooh-wah! [He crumples up the piece of paper and throws it into the garbage can, which on the other side of the room. He puts the patty on the grill on the side that does not have paper on it. He removes the remaining piece of paper, crumples it up and throws it out the order window, where it bounces of Squidward's head, who is still sleeping, and lands in the garbage can next to him. The scene changes to SpongeBob powering up the Slice-O-Matic and splits himself into small naked SpongeBobs that jump into sink full of soapy water, so they can wash the dishes. After getting the job done, they all go to the grill (there is nine of them) where the real SpongeBob is reconstructed with his spatula in his hand.] Oh! [He flips the patty, puts the spatula in his pocket and flies through order window, waking up Squidward by taking his hat off.]
",9
22277,Squidward,189," Hmm? Who's that? [Puts his hat back and goes back to sleep.]
",9
22278,SpongeBob,189," [Lands on a beam where a bucket and a mop are prepared, ties rope to his hat, takes mop puts his head and does the victory screech. Jumps of the beam and mops floor while swinging across the Krusty Krab. He continues to mop the floor but this time he spins while leaving water tracks in a form of ""Z"" on the floor. He gets back on the beam.] Ah! [Takes spatula out of his pocket, leans himself off the beam again, he cuts the rope tied to his hat, he flies back to the kitchen through order window and takes a patty of the grill. He lands near a counter with containers with the Krabby Patty ingredients and makes two halves of a patty.] Hmm, something's missing. [Realizes what is missing and runs towards a cabinet with pickles and opens it. He picks which one it is and takes it.] Aha! June 15th. [He shakes the jar, opens the lid, slurps some of the pickle juice, evaluates it in his mouth, and returns it to the jar.] Fine month for pickles. [He goes back to the counter and adds two pickles and adds a slice of lettuce which was on the other side of the patty, he then connect both halves, he then exit from kitchen with the fully-made Krabby Patty] Order up! [He wakes Squidward and Squidward's hat falls off.] One perfect patty on a pristine plate in a squeaky-clean Krusty Krab. Man, oh, man, do I love my job! [Mr. Krabs taps him on the shoulder] Hey, Mr. Krabs. What's the good word?
",9
22279,Mr. Krabs,189," Well, actually, SpongeBob, uh, there's two words. And they're not very good. You're fired.
",9
22280,SpongeBob,189," [chuckles] Oh, Mr.- [shouts] what?
",9
22281,Squidward,189," Fired?
",9
22282,Mr. Krabs,189," Well, you see, I've been doin' some calculatin' and, you know, crunching the old numbers. And it turns out that I'll save a whole nickel if I cut your salary. Completely.
",9
22283,SpongeBob,189," [stammers] But how about if I work for free?
",9
22284,Mr. Krabs,189," Yeah, I looked into that. Apparently, it's [makes air quotes] ""illegal"". And I'll lose my ""vendor's license"". Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
",9
22285,Bill,189," Uh, 'scuse me. Is that mine?
",9
22286,SpongeBob,189," I don't know. Maybe. [Drops the plate and sniffs] Take it.
",9
22287,Mr. Krabs,189," [grabs SpongeBob] You know I love you like a son. But you can't argue with a nickel.
",9
22288,SpongeBob,189," But--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but.
",9
22289,Squidward,189," Hey, what about me? Can I get fired too?
",9
22290,Mr. Krabs,189," I'm afraid not, Squidward. You've got seniority.
",9
22291,Squidward,189," Oh, yeah.
",9
22292,Mr. Krabs,189," Nope, it's gotta be you, son. You're canned. [Gives can to SpongeBob] Here's your pink slip. [Puts pink dress on SpongeBob] I'm giving you the ax. [Gives SpongeBob an ax. SpongeBob splits himself in half with it and returns to normal afterwards.] You're fired.
",9
22293,SpongeBob,189," [gasps, then bursts into tears] No! Not that! Anything but that! [Starts crying]
",9
22294,Mr. Krabs,189," So, uh, if you could just hand over your spatula. Um... I'll just take that. [Grunts while he tries to takes spatula out of SpongeBob's hand.]
",9
22295,SpongeBob,189," Here, I'll get that for you. [Takes his arm off]
",9
22296,Mr. Krabs,189," I'll also need the hat. Allow me. [Tries to take the hat of SpongeBob's head, but it is connected to SpongeBob's head, he succeeds with heavy resistance] Go ahead; take a moment to collect yourself. Long as you need. [Walks away]
",9
22297,Old Man Jenkins,189," [sitting on the barrel] I'm not a very strong swimmer.
",9
22298,Squidward,189," [Comes over with a cranking hole maker and makes a hole in the floor and the tears drain through the hole. Walks away and comes back with a box carrier. He picks up SpongeBob with it.] Okay, that's enough. It's closing time. [He moves SpongeBob out of the Krusty Krab and SpongeBob stops crying] You know, it just won't be the same around here without you. You'll have to visit sometime... [Pushes SpongeBob off the box carrier and backs up through the Krusty Krab doors with it.] As a customer. [SpongeBob starts crying again. Squidward talks to him from the front door.] Buh-bye now. Sayonara. Good riddance. [He closes the door and walks past a window] Man, is it gonna be sweet without that pest around! [He stops as he sees SpongeBob looking through the window while whimpering and Squidward lowers a ""Krabby Patty"" ad to hide him.] This day couldn't get any better. [Turns around and see Mr. Krabs] Well, Eugene, let me commend you on a terrific business decision. But now that SpongeBob's gone, who will be running the grill?
",9
22299,Mr. Krabs,189," Squidward, I'll have you know, [put SpongeBob's hat on the top of his eye stalks] I was five times ""golden spatula"" in the navy, [He holds up the spatula, still attached to SpongeBob's hand] so I'll be runnin' the grill. [It catches on fire.] Ooh!
",9
22300,Squidward,189," I can smell the grease fires already.
",9
22301,SpongeBob,189," [enters his house where Gary is waiting on the front door] Hey, Gary, I'm home. [Walks to his chair, lowers his head over the chair's arm and starts crying again.]
",9
22302,Gary,189," [Walks up to the chair] Meow. Meow.
",9
22303,SpongeBob,189," [takes his head up] Oh, Mr. Krabs feels he doesn't need me anymore.
",9
22304,Gary,189," Meow.
",9
22305,SpongeBob,189," What's that, Gary? You need me? Oh, the unconditional love of a pet. [Gary takes his food bowl and puts it on the chair's other arm] Oh, I'm sorry. Here I am wallowing in my misery, and it's past your dinnertime. [Gets off the chair's arm and walks to the cabinet, bows his head over the counter below it and sighs. Takes the can of Snail food out of the cabinet and uses a can opener to open it. He manages to get his arm tangled to the can] I used to feed everyone in Bikini Bottom. [He walks over to Gary and his food bowl] Now I just feed you. [He pours the snail food out of the can into Gary's food bowl. The can falls on the floor and SpongeBob's arm unwrapped as he leaves to sit on the chair. Gary brings SpongeBob's long arm and puts it over the chair's arm] Oh, thanks, Gary.
",9
22306,Gary,189," Meow. [Gary leaves]
",9
22307,SpongeBob,189," [takes remote] That's how I used to hold my spatula. [He jumps off the chair and gets on his knees and starts crying again. He stops when he hears a distant sobbing noise and then starts sobbing too. Stops when he hears distant sobbing again. He looks out his window to see it was Patrick. He walks over to the window.] Patrick, what's wrong?
",9
22308,Patrick,189," [stops sobbing] Oh, hey, SpongeBob. I heard you crying and it made me sad. [Both do a stifled crying]
",9
22309,SpongeBob,189," Gee, I'm sorry. Why don't you come inside?
",9
22310,Patrick,189," [enters by breaking through the wall] Hi, SpongeBob! Why are you making me so sad?
",9
22311,SpongeBob,189," Patrick, the most horrible thing happened today. I got-- f-f-f-f-f-f-f...
",9
22312,Patrick,189," Free French fries?
",9
22313,SpongeBob,189," F-f-f-f-f-f-f...
",9
22314,Patrick,189," Fried Frittatas?
",9
22315,SpongeBob,189," F-f-f-f-f-f-f...
",9
22316,Patrick,189," Frothy frappe?
",9
22317,SpongeBob,189," F-f-f-f...
",9
22318,Patrick,189," I can't think of any more food that starts with the letter ""c"", SpongeBob.
",9
22319,SpongeBob,189," It's not food, Patrick. I got fired.
",9
22320,Patrick,189," Hey, that's great! Being unemployed is the best gig I know! [He grabs SpongeBob's side] I tell you what. Meet me tomorrow morning, and I'll introduce you to the wonders of the unemployed lifestyle.
",9
22321,SpongeBob,189," Sorry, Patrick, I can't. I have to wor-- oh. Yeah, okay.
",9
22322,Patrick,189," [pats him on the head] Great. See you then. [Exits by breaking through another wall and leaves a hole behind.]
",9
22323,SpongeBob,189," Yeah, sure. [Slurps] Whatever.
",9
22324,Patrick,189," That's the spirit! [Leads SpongeBob out of his house] Now, the first stop on our tour of fun-employment is a healthy breakfast with our good friend Mr. Squidward. [Patrick is standing in his petunias and pointing at Squidward raking his garden] Hey, Squidward! How are you this fine morning? [Squidward starts growling angrily]
",9
22325,Squidward,189," [angrily] How many times do I have to tell you... Keep.. [Throws tomato] Off... [Throws cucumber] My... [Throws another tomato]... Petunias?!
",9
22326,Patrick,189," [has two tomatoes and cucumber arranged to form eyes and nose. Takes tomato, salts it, eats it, takes cucumber with his tongue, and eats it.] I'll just save this for later. [Puts tomato in his pants] Now you try.
",9
22327,SpongeBob,189," [still holding the ""Best Day Ever"" cup] Uh... [Stands in petunias as Patrick exits it while laughing.] Hey, Squidward. Look at me. I'm fun-employed! [Slams a basket full of vegetables on SpongeBob and rips apart his hat. SpongeBob slurps.]
",9
22328,Patrick,189," Hey, you're good at this. Next on our i-tin-er-ary, a brief mid-morning siesta. [He sticks himself to his rock.]
",9
22329,Gary,189," Meow.
",9
22330,SpongeBob,189," [sighs deeply and then groans. sighs deeply and then groans. Tears a part of himself off, dips it into the coffee and eats it. The teared part grows back and then Patrick wakes up and walks over to SpongeBob.]
",9
22331,Patrick,189," [yawns] Are you feelin' any better yet?
",9
22332,SpongeBob,189," [slurps] Uh-uh.
",9
22333,Patrick,189," Come on, SadPants. You know what always picks me up? [Picks SpongeBob up]
",9
22334,SpongeBob,189," [spills coffee] Nope.
",9
22335,Patrick,189," Free lunch with friends!
",9
22336,SpongeBob,189," [lifts cup in the air] Yippee.
",9
22337,Sandy,189," Okay, let's begin the experiment. [Volunteer A eats his sample and his head expands into the shape of a ball.] Mm-hmm. [Writes down some notes and walks to the Patrick] Okay, next.
",9
22338,Patrick,189," Oh, boy, lunch! [Puts his head into his sample and eats and a tiny Patrick grows on his forehead]
",9
22339,Patrick's Forehead,189," More! More! [Patrick gives him more]
",9
22340,Sandy,189," Very interesting. [Writes something down again and walks to SpongeBob] Okay, next. [Notices that it is SpongeBob] SpongeBob! I almost didn't recognize you. [Shows SpongeBob's face] You look awful! What are you doin' with these here freeloaders?
",9
22341,SpongeBob,189," I got fired. Now I'm fun-employed. [Shakes his spoon in the air] Whoo-hoo. [He takes a spoonful of his sample and is about to eat it, but Sandy stops him.]
",9
22342,Sandy,189," Whoa, there. You do not want to eat that.
",9
22343,SpongeBob,189," Why? What is it?
",9
22344,Sandy,189," Heck if I know. [Whispering] this here's a psychological test to see how much weird gunk folks will eat... if it's free. [She walks over to a barrel with the radioactive sign on it and smoke coming from it. She stirs it and scoops up the content with a ladle] Who's for seconds?
",9
22345,Both Patricks,189," Me! [Sandy refills Patrick's bowl.]
",9
22346,Patrick,189," [takes a spoonful and gives it to tiny Patrick] Here ya go, little buddy. [He chews it, swallows it and it falls onto Patrick's tongue. He swallows it.] Ahh. Mmm!
",9
22347,Sandy,189," SpongeBob, you're a mess. You're falling apart. [SpongeBob's brain with his eyes falls out of his head. Sandy picks it up.] Come on now, SpongeBob. You need to pull yourself together. Get some structure in your life. [Puts brain and eyes back into SpongeBob's head] What you need is a new job.
",9
22348,SpongeBob,189," You're right, Sandy. [Turns to Patrick] I'm afraid I can't do this anymore, Patrick. Unemployment may be fun for you, but I need to get a job.
",9
22349,Patrick's Forehead,189," Who do you think you're fooling, you loser? You couldn't keep a job if you tried!
",9
22350,Patrick,189," Hey! You can't talk to my friend like that! [Punches tiny Patrick into face]
",9
22351,Patrick's Forehead,189," Unh! [Groans]
",9
22352,Patrick,189," Don't listen to him, SpongeBob. You need to follow your heart.
",9
22353,SpongeBob,189," [He sees a man dressed in a weenie costume and talks to him.] Greetings, purveyor of elongated sausage products! I would love to work at your establishment.
",9
22354,Mr. Weiner,189," [dressed as weenie] Well, you do look enthusiastic. [Shows SpongeBob looking enthusiastically] Hmm. All right, kid. [He holds SpongeBob's side.] Let's see what you got. [They walk into the kitchen. SpongeBob now has a hot dog-shaped hat on.] So this is the kitchen.
",9
22355,SpongeBob,189," Hmm. [He goes to the grill and touches a button and it pops off and is hanging on a wire.] This grill is not in very good shape.
",9
22356,Mr. Weiner,189," Oh, we don't use the grill. [Points to the roller] We cook everything on the roller. [Shows roller with hot dogs rolling on it. SpongeBob screams] Good luck, kid. [Walks outside]
",9
22357,SpongeBob,189," [takes a hot dog off the roller and puts it in the bun] Hmm. There's something not quite right about this food, but I'm not sure what it is. [Gets an idea] Aha! [Slices the hot dog into pieces]
",9
22358,Mr. Weiner,189," [takes a golden box with three sausages out of his jacket, takes one out, closes the box, returns the box, smells the sausage, eats it and then burps. He turns to the kitchen door.] Hey! Where are those weenies? [SpongeBob slams him with the kitchen door while exiting with a plate of ""weenie patties"".]
",9
22359,SpongeBob,189," Your weenies, sir. [presents the plate of ""weenie patties"" to Mr. Weiner]
",9
22360,Mr. Weiner,189," What in the name of Davy Jones' gym shorts are these?
",9
22361,SpongeBob,189," They're weenie patties.
",9
22362,Mr. Weiner,189," What are you some kind of nut? You've ruined my weenies! [Throws the plate away] You're fired! [Throws SpongeBob's hat away]
",9
22363,SpongeBob,189," Aah! But, Mr. Krabs, why?
",9
22364,Mr. Weiner,189," Mr. Who?
",9
22365,SpongeBob,189," I mean, Mr. Wiener!
",9
22366,Mr. Weiner,189," Just go. [SpongeBob leaves]
",9
22367,SpongeBob,189," [outside] Well that was a setback. [Shows him heading to the ""Pizza Piehole""] Hello, Pizza Piehole!
",9
22368,Pizza Pete,189," [throws pizza dough in the air and it ends up on the fan]
",9
22369,SpongeBob,189," [from behind] Excuse me, Mr. Pizza man. [Approaches] You need a fry-cook? [Pizza dough falls on the fish]
",9
22370,Pizza Pete,189," [removes part of dough blocking his view] Oh, boy, do I! Can you make pizza? [Hands him the dough]
",9
22371,SpongeBob,189," [takes dough] Eh... probably. [Stretches dough, throws in into the air and starts spinning it on his pointer finger]
",9
22372,Pizza Pete,189," Oh, that's amazing. [Shakes SpongeBob's hand] Congratulations, you're hired.
",9
22373,SpongeBob,189," Cool. [Walks to the oven while still spinning the dough on his finger, put it on the kitchen board and then in the oven] Well, it's no Krabby Patty, but... Perhaps I'll find contentment.
",9
22374,Pizza Pete,189," [wiping the table] Hey, buddy, how's the pizza coming?
",9
22375,SpongeBob,189," Almost done! But I did change the recipe a bit.
",9
22376,Pizza Pete,189," [laughs] No problem. [Bell dings] A few extra toppings never hurt anyone. [SpongeBob approaches with ""Pizza Patty""] Huh? What have you done? [Shows Pizza Patty] You've turned an innocent pizza into... a Pizza Patty! It's an abomination!
",9
22377,SpongeBob,189," Yeah, of deliciousness!
",9
22378,Pizza Pete,189," You're fired!
",9
22379,SpongeBob,189," But who'll make the Krabby Patties?
",9
22380,Pizza Pete,189," Krabby Patties? What do you think this is, the Krusty Krab? [Holding SpongeBob's leg, he drops SpongeBob on the ground outside of the restaurant]
",9
22381,SpongeBob,189," [gets up and cleans dirt off himself.] Like I need his dumb job, anyway. I hope his pepperoni falls off. [Enters ""Taco Sombrero""] Hey, taco man, may I have a job, por favour?
",9
22382,Señor Taco,189," [dressed in a taco costume] Hmm. All right. Let's see what you can do with a burrito.
",9
22383,SpongeBob,189," [enters kitchen ""in"" door, we hear some noises inside and he then exits through the kitchen ""out"" door with ""Burrito Patty"" in a bun] How about that?
",9
22384,Señor Taco,189," [takes ""Burrito Patty""] Interesting. It's some sort of ""burrito patty"". Hmm. [turns to customers] Who'd like to taste it?
",9
22385,Pilar,189," I'll give it a go! [Takes Burrito Patty, tries to bite it and ends up squeezing its content to Frank and Billy]
",9
22386,Señor Taco,189," You're fired!
",9
22387,SpongeBob,189," [starts whimpering] But I've given you the best years of my life, Mr. Krabs! [Cries while holding Señor Taco's feet]
",9
22388,Señor Taco,189," Get to steppin'!
",9
22389,SpongeBob,189," [He cries while going from ""Taco Sombrero"" to ""Wet Noodle"". Some crashing is heard once he gets inside.]
",9
22390,Noodleman,189," [dressed as Chinese Takeout box. He carries SpongeBob out.] You're fired! [Kicks SpongeBob]
",9
22391,SpongeBob,189," Aah! [Lands in dirt]
",9
22392,Noodleman,189," [shows ""Noodle Patty""] And take your noodle patty with you! [Throws it at SpongeBob]
",9
22393,SpongeBob,189," [Noodle Patty splashes his face] Oh, I'll take it, all right. I'll take it to go! Home.
",9
22394,SpongeBob,189," [sighs] For years I worked at the Krusty Krab. Now I've been fired five times in one day. [Enters his house] Who are you gonna cook for now, SpongeBob?
",9
22395,Gary,189," [approaches] Meow.
",9
22396,SpongeBob,189," Sorry, Gary, you must be starving. [Takes Gary to the kitchen] Don't worry gare-bear. [Goes towards the cabinet] I'll open up a can of Snailpo for you. [Opens cabinet and see there is nothing in there] Oh, no. [Turns to Gary] We're all out of Snailpo. [Walks away] We'll just have to make our own. [Opens fridge takes some vegetables out of it and closes the fridge with his foot. Takes the vegetables to kitchen counter, chops them with his hands, carries them to a pot, and puts them in that pot. Whistles while it's cooking and then takes a wooden spoon to mix the contents until it starts boiling. Tastes what's on the spoon.] Perfect! [Takes the pot, leaves it on kitchen counter, he takes can, and puts the pot's contents in it.]
",9
22397,SpongeBob,189," [glues the label that he made to the can, put the lid on it and hits the can with a mallet, so that the lid can settle. He presents it to Gary] One homemade can of Snailpo! [Uses can opener to open it, pours snail's food into Gary's food bowl and throws the can into trash on the other side of the room.]
",9
22398,Gary,189," [eats satisfactorily] Meow.
",9
22399,SpongeBob,189," [leans towards Gary] What's that, Gary? It's the best food you've ever had?
",9
22400,Gary,189," Meow.
",9
22401,Patrick,189," [raises his head] Yeah, this is dee-licious! Does it have any side effects?
",9
22402,SpongeBob,189," [stands up] Only satisfaction. [Sighs] If only my bosses liked my cooking as much as you two do. [Looks at tiny Patrick] I mean three. [Someone knocks on the door. Goes towards the front door and opens it to see that nobody is there.] Hello. Hmm. That's odd. I could've sworn I heard a knock at the door. [Two fish dressed in hot dog costumes puts him between two big buns. SpongeBob yells while being muffled.]
",9
22403,SpongeBob,189," Mr. Weenie?
",9
22404,Mr. Weiner,189," Congratulations, SpongeBob, you've been promoted.
",9
22405,SpongeBob,189," But you just fired me.
",9
22406,Mr. Weiner,189," That's mustard under the bun, my boy. The important thing is my customers love your little sliders. [Shows ""Weenie Patty""] Now get to work!
",9
22407,SpongeBob,189," [rises handcuffed hand] I'm pretty sure this is illegal. What am I gonna do now?
",9
22408,Pizza Pete,189," [from the background] Psst! [shows him in the shadow] Hey, kid. You need help outta here? [Leans out of the shadow]
",9
22409,SpongeBob,189," Pizza Pete! Yes, please. That wiener has me chained to the grill, [Pizza Pete approaches him] and he really seems to be relishing it.
",9
22410,Pizza Pete,189," I have something to free you. [Takes pizza sauce out]
",9
22411,SpongeBob,189," Pizza sauce? [Pizza Pete puts the pizza sauce on both handcuffs] I'm free!
",9
22412,Pizza Pete,189," Great! Now you can get to my grill. [Takes bread stick out]
",9
22413,SpongeBob,189," What? [Pizza Pete ties his hands with the breadstick] Parmesan-crusted breadstick! [Pizza Pete takes him] Whoa!
",9
22414,Mr. Weiner,189," [from the kitchen door] Hey! Where are you going with my fry cook?
",9
22415,Noodleman,189," [takes SpongeBob with chopsticks and laughs while being on the roof] I'll take one fry-cook to go! [He jumps off the roof and laughs again after landing. Señor Taco opens the door next to him and sends him away]
",9
22416,SpongeBob,189," [lands] Oh, thank you, Señor Taco! [Señor Taco grabs him with his suit] Oh, no! Not you too! [He screams while Señor Taco carries him]
",9
22417,"Pizza Pete, Mr. Weiner and Noodleman",189," [Señor Taco runs into them] Get him! [They jump on Señor Taco]
",9
22418,SpongeBob,189," Whoa!
",9
22419,Noodleman,189," Let go!
",9
22420,Mr. Weiner,189," He's mine!
",9
22421,Señor Taco,189," I was here first!
",9
22422,Pizza Pete,189," No, I was!
",9
22423,Krabby Patty Man,189," Stop! Unhand that sponge! [Jumps on Pizza Pete and punches him away. Takes Señor Taco and destroys his costume by gobbling it. Señor Taco runs away embarrassed.]
",9
22424,Noodleman,189," [drops SpongeBob] It's the Killer Patty! [Gets noodles squeezed out of his costume by Krabby Patty Man]
",9
22425,Mr. Weiner,189," [Krabby Patty Man walks towards him and he drops SpongeBob before he gets to him] Here, take him! Just don't hurt me. [Whimpers with eyes closed. Opens eyes to see that Krabby Patty Man is gone and sighs. Starts humming while crossing the street and is hit by a bus] Aah!
",9
22426,SpongeBob,189," [opens eyes] Krabby Patty! You saved me! [Krabby Patty Man starts carrying him] Well, here we go again.
",9
22427,John,189," Ugh! This place is terrible!
",9
22428,Blue Fred,189," The Krusty Krab has really gone downhill.
",9
22429,Nat Peterson,189," [holding burned Krabby Patty] How can you serve this slop? [Throws it on the floor] I'm never eating here again! [Leaves]
",9
22430,Mr. Krabs,189," [holding spatula in his hand and exiting the kitchen with one burnt eyebrow.] Wait! Come back! [Drops spatula] That was me last customer. [SpongeBob and Krabby Patty Man approach] SpongeBob? [Takes SpongeBob and lifts him.] Squidward, you found him!
",9
22431,SpongeBob,189," [gasps] Squidward?
",9
22432,Squidward,189," [takes Krabby Patty costume off] I'm afraid so. [Kicks costume and leans hand towards SpongeBob] SpongeBob...
",9
22433,SpongeBob,189," Yes, Squidward?
",9
22434,Squidward,189," You know I hate you, right?
",9
22435,SpongeBob,189," Yes. [Smiles and takes Squidward's ""arm"" tentacle] Yes, I do.
",9
22436,Squidward,189," Well, I hate the smell of burning Krabby Patties even more. [Gets on his knee and takes SpongeBob's hands] Please come back and be the fry cook again. [Lets SpongeBob hands go]
",9
22437,SpongeBob,189," [turns to Mr. Krabs] Well, if it's okay with you, Mr. Krabs.
",9
22438,Mr. Krabs,189," Oh, laddy. [Takes SpongeBob] I shoulda never let you go. The Krusty Krab has fallen apart without you. You're rehired, boy.
",9
22439,SpongeBob,189," [turns to Squidward who is still on knees] All right! Now my life has purpose again! [Turns away] Let's get this place cleaned up. [Jumps on the beam where bucket and mop are prepared and his hat already tied to the rope. Does the victory screech, jumps of the beam and cleans everything while swinging; including giving Mr. Krabs brand new suit and Squidward a brand new pink dress and crown.]
",9
22440,Squidward,189," Hmm. [examines dress] Not exactly my color.
",9
22441,SpongeBob,189," [cuts the rope tied to his hat, flies back to the kitchen through order window, takes patty off the grill and exits through the kitchen door with the Krabby Patty on the plate.] The Krusty Krab is back in business!
",9
22442,Mr. Krabs,189," Well, SpongeBob, it looks like things are back to normal. And to make up for that extra nickel I was losing, I installed a pay toilet. [Shows Old Man Jenkins holding a purse looking for a nickel for the pay toilet]
",9
22443,Old Man Jenkins,189," [hopping] Oh, dear, where is that nickel? [Shows SpongeBob, Squidward and Mr. Krabs laughing] Huh? Why are you laughing?",9

",9
22459,Squidward,190," Late? We're gonna be there fifteen minutes early!
",9
22460,SpongeBob,190," I know, only fifteen minutes early? Maybe we should take a shortcut! [Squidward stops moving] [SpongeBob gasps] Squidward, what are you doing?! [SpongeBob tries to get Squidward to move, and falls onto the ground trying to do so]
",9
22461,Squidward,190," SpongeBob, look. [pointing to the Krusty Krab] We're walking in a straight line.
",9
22462,SpongeBob,190," I don't follow.

",9

",9
22474,SpongeBob,190," [SpongeBob puts on an explorer hat] Squidward, I am going to find that shortcut!
",9
22475,Squidward,190," Look, the Krusty Krab is right at the end of the block!
",9
22476,Mr. Krabs,190," Yoo-hoo!
",9
22477,Squidward,190," No, SpongeBob. I'm just going to struggle through the rest of this walk, alone.
",9
22478,SpongeBob,190," Well, I guess this is where we part ways. But I can't wait to see your face when you get to work and I'm already there! [laughs] That's the face! That's the look! [laughs as Squidward walks to the Krusty Krab] [SpongeBob runs off the road to find the ""shortcut""] [singing while going through many landmarks] First you do a zig, then you take a little zag, that's how find you a shortcut! Crawl underneath the fence, struggle through a bush, and that's how you find a shortcut! [notices Squidward] Huh?
",9
22479,Squidward,190," Straight line, point A to point B. You're still not getting it.
",9
22480,SpongeBob,190," Oh, tartar sauce! Maybe I should've zagged when I zigged! [singing again, going through more landmarks] First you do a zag, crawl underneath the fence, then you take a little zig, that's how you find a shortcut! [laughs] There, that's better. [SpongeBob notices he's in a darker part of town] [laughs nervously] Now this is what I call a real great shortcut. Now all I have to do is remember my wilderness training so I don't get lost! [SpongeBob imagines of what Sandy said to him]
",9
22481,Sandy,190," [in a thought bubble] First rule of wilderness training, is map out your course, by taking note of local landmarks!
",9
22482,SpongeBob,190," Local landmarks... [SpongeBob looks left and right spotting local landmarks] A-ha! [pointing to a large and unusual shell] Right at this large and unusual shell. [the creature under the shell emerges and walks away] Right at this abandoned sofa, and jog left at the broken fire hydrant. [SpongeBob spots what appears to be the sign to the Krusty Krab] There it is, the Krusty Krab! [SpongeBob climbs over the fence to see it]
",9
22483,Squidward,190," Ahhhh.... [Mr. Krabs appears]
",9
22484,Mr. Krabs,190," Well, look at this. Lazing about. [in a mocking voice] Can I get you anything else, another pillow, maybe? A cappuccino machine?
",9
22485,Squidward,190," No thanks, I got one! [Squidward pours himself a mug of cappuccino with an image of his face in it] Perfect. No customers. No SpongeBob.
",9
22486,Mr. Krabs,190," Oh, for kelp sake. You're a lost cause.
",9
22487,SpongeBob,190," [gasps] The Krabby Krust?! [SpongeBob notices a guy painting signs] Is that the name of a restaurant?
",9
22488,Sal,190," No, it's a typo.
",9
22489,SpongeBob,190," Could you perhaps tell me how to get to the Krusty Krab from here?
",9
22490,Sal,190," Never heard of it.
",9
22491,SpongeBob,190," Oh, you should try it! It's the best place to eat in all of Bikini Bottom! [SpongeBob hands the fish coupons] Here, take this coupons!
",9
22492,Sal,190," Thanks! I'm going to go there right now! [the fish hands his paintbrush to SpongeBob and drives away in his truck]
",9
22493,SpongeBob,190," I thought you didn't know where the Krusty Krab was! Oh, what do I do now? [cries] [SpongeBob imagines Sandy again, who is hammering a tent to the ground. When Sandy talks to him, SpongeBob stops crying]
",9
22494,Sandy,190," [in thought bubble] Remember, your landmarks!
",9
22495,SpongeBob,190," Sandy's wilderness tips are always on the money! [SpongeBob goes back the way he came] Okay, let's see, I came from...no, I came... [running in circles] I'M LOST! [screams, until he spots the broken fire hydrant he previously saw] Hey, there's one of my landmarks! The broken fire hydrant! [sits down near the hydrant] Hello, hydrant! I'm going to call you Heidi. Heidi the Hydrant! [SpongeBob notices many broken fire hydrants] So many broken fire hydrants. What do I do now, Heidi? If only I could telephone Squidward. He'd help me out. [sees a payphone] Hey, that thing looks kind of like a phone. [walks to it] Wow, this is weird. It's like a phone, but you put money in it. [shakes himself upside down; a dime falls out] My last dime. [picks up phone] I hope this works. [puts dime in coin slot. The cash register phone rings at the Krusty Krab. Squidward groans and answers it]
",9
22496,Squidward,190," Krusty Krab. May I reluctantly help you?
",9
22497,SpongeBob,190," It's me, Squidward. SpongeBob. I'm calling from the payphone.
",9
22498,Squidward,190," You don't say. How's that shortcutting going?
",9
22499,SpongeBob,190," Not good. I think I took a wrong turn at the abandoned sofa. All there is around here are broken fire hydrants. What should I do?! [beep from the phone]
",9
22500,Operator,190," If you'd like to continue this call, please insert another dime.
",9
22501,SpongeBob,190," I don't have a dime! Operator, please, please, can you tell me where I am?
",9
22502,Operator,190," If you'd like to know where you are, please insert another dime.
",9
22503,SpongeBob,190," Uh, hold on! [SpongeBob runs to the abandoned sofa, where three tough-looking fish are sitting on it drinking sodas (the main one sitting in the center, Scott, resembles Harold). He digs his hands under the cushions, and finds two nickels] Two nickels! I need a dime! Oh, I'm never going to get to work!
",9
22504,Scott,190," What are ya doing?
",9
22505,SpongeBob,190," Looking for a dime in this abandoned sofa!
",9
22506,Scott,190," This is our abandoned sofa, pal!
",9
22507,SpongeBob,190," What ya doing there, drinking soda?
",9
22508,Scott,190," What's it tooya!
",9
22509,SpongeBob,190," Isn't it a little early to be hitting the high-fructose corn-syrup?
",9
22510,Scott,190," [he and the fish to the right of him, who resembles Charlie, give off surprised looks. Scott gets off the sofa and approaches SpongeBob] Hey, listen! I know this gigantic soda isn't good for me, but sometimes it gives me the kick I need to start my busy day as a pedicab driver!
",9
22511,SpongeBob,190," Ooh, you drive a pedicab?
",9
22512,Scott,190," Yes, sir! [Scott puts on a pedicab driver's hat and grabs his pedicab, which SpongeBob gets into] You need a ride somewhere?
",9
22513,SpongeBob,190," Yes! To the Krusty Krab, and step on it! [Scott drives away]
",9
22514,Scooter,190," Way to go, Scott!
",9
22515,Charlie,190," Yeah, he's almost saved enough to attend a community college next year! [he and Scooter clench their soda together and continue to drink them]
",9
22516,SpongeBob,190," [gets off of the pedicab] Thanks a lot, Scott! Stay in school! [SpongeBob notices the sign] Krusty Klam?! [gasps] Wait, Scott, come back! [Scott drives away, leaving SpongeBob behind] TARTER SAUCE!!! [SpongeBob begins frantically running, and checks his clock]
",9
22517,SpongeBob's Clock,190," Tock!
",9
22518,SpongeBob,190," No! Over the cliff! [jumps off the cliff into the muck] Through the toxic runoff! [runs through a sewer pipe] Make a right at the disease-filled sewer pipe! [SpongeBob slides out of the sewer pipe] Face-first into this fetid muck! Over the garbage pile! Fall down this mountain of broken glass! Over the excruciatingly sharp razor-wire! [SpongeBob falls down with wires attached to him] Up this massive hill! [SpongeBob grows so tired he falls down flat on his face] That's...the Krusty Krab! And I'm still 2 minutes early! [SpongeBob crawls his way to the Krusty Krab] [SpongeBob enters the Krusty Krab]I made it! I made it! [SpongeBob hugs two customers] Oh, random Krusty Krab patrients! How I've missed out! [SpongeBob jumps onto an old fish's lap and kisses her] Oh, how I've missed your youthful faces! [the scene then cuts to outside the bathroom with SpongeBob in it] I missed the bathroom, too! [two fish come running out screaming] [SpongeBob approaches a fish choking on his Krabby Patty] But most of all, I missed you, choking guy! [SpongeBob hugs the choking fish who spits out his chewed-up Krabby Patty, which lands on Patrick's Krabby Patty] [SpongeBob notices Patrick] Patrick? How did you get here?
",9
22519,Patrick,190," Same way I always do. Scott gave me a ride in his pedicab. [Scott, in his pedicab, appears outside and winks]
",9
22520,SpongeBob,190," [SpongeBob notices Squidward] Squidward! Squidward, can you believe I made it?! [Old Man Jenkins appears to be hanging from the razor-wires on SpongeBob, and groans]
",9
22521,Squidward,190," Congratulations. [Mr. Krabs appears]
",9
22522,Mr. Krabs,190," What are you doing, boy?! You're scaring all me customers with your foul stench!
",9
22523,SpongeBob,190," [hugs Mr. Krabs] Mr. Krabs!
",9
22524,Mr. Krabs,190," [pushes SpongeBob off of him] Oh no, lad, you're not coming in here looking like that! [shot of SpongeBob looking like a wreck] You're going straight home for a nice long bubble bath! [Mr. Krabs pushes SpongeBob outside]
",9
22525,SpongeBob,190," Aye-aye, sir!
",9
22526,Squidward,190," What?! He gets to go home and take a bubble bath?! That's my thing!
",9
22527,Mr. Krabs,190," Yes it is. And consequently, you are just neat as a pin! Now get to work!
",9
22528,Squidward,190," I'm as neat as a pin? I'll show you neat as a pin! [Squidward runs outside, and gets himself dirty by rolling in dirt, ripping off his shirt, and pouring dirt on his head] Where's my bubble bath, Mr. Krabs?! [Mr. Krabs sprays Squidward with a hose]
",9
22529,Mr. Krabs,190," There you go! [a truck passes by and drives over a puddle, spraying Squidward, who is already laying in the puddle, with more water] Now get to work! [Sal exits out of his truck]
",9
22530,Sal,190," Uh, you guys open? I have coupons! ""Buy one, get one free!""
",9
22531,Mr. Krabs,190," Oh no! It says ""Buy one for a fee!""
",9
22532,Sal,190," Oh! I stand corrected! [Mr. Krabs and Sal walk offscreen, leaving Squidward in the puddle, as the episode ends]",9

",9
22567,Squidward,191," Do you have to do it?
",9
22568,Norton,191," Well, no, you could go alone. It's just that everyone will laugh at you 'cause they think you're a friendless loser.

",9

",9
22582,SpongeBob,191," Oh, he said he had a package for the Widow Duncan. I think he went...
",9
22583,Norton,191," And then you just initial there and we're all set.
",9

",9

",9

",9

",9

",9
22591,Norton,191," [laughs nervously] Yeah, I don't know. I'm just a regular guy. But in not being a mailman, I love going to fancy art galleries.
",9
22592,Squidward,191," That's me!
",9
22593,Norton,191," And eating delicious food.
",9
22594,Squidward,191," Oh, delicious food is my favorite kind of food! Especially when that delicious food is something you can...
",9
22595,Both,191," Spread on a toast point!
",9
22596,Squidward,191," Once you've had pointed toast, you just never want any other kind.
",9

",9
22598,Squidward,191," SpongeBob!
",9
22599,Norton,191," Clarinets!
",9
22600,Squidward,191," Yeah, I know it... What?
",9
22601,Norton,191," I mean what kind of maniac could enjoy the sound of a clarinet? That squeaky hollow kind of piercing howl from the very pits of Gehenna. Only a deluded blow-hog, with nothing to lose, could pick up a [grunts] clarinet and think ""Yeah! This is for me! Let me inflict this pain on the world!"". [laughs] Am I right, buddy? Heh. Uh.
",9
22602,Norton,191," Buddy? [slaps his face] Stupid, stupid, stupid! Why are you so darn opinionated, Norton? All you do with your searing and abnormal honesty is drive everyone away! When's Norton's time? When's Norton's time to shine?!

",9
22604,Squidward,191," Oh, you think you know a guy? [kicks can] Oh, who are you kidding? It's not in the cards for you. I bet not even this old tin can would be my friend.
",9
22605,SpongeBob,191," [talks through can] I'll be your friend.
",9
22606,Squidward,191," [grumbles as he picks up the can] Who is this?
",9
22607,SpongeBob,191," It's me, SpongeBob.
",9
22608,Squidward,191," SpongeBob!
",9
22609,SpongeBob,191," Yes? I'm still here.
",9
22610,Squidward,191," I need to ask you something important.
",9
22611,SpongeBob,191," You don't have to ask me three times.
",9
22612,Squidward,191," Will you tell Larry I wanna talk to him?
",9
22613,SpongeBob,191," Oh.
",9
22614,SpongeBob,191," Okey-doke.
",9
22615,Larry,191," So, Squidward, what do you wanna talk about?
",9
22616,Squidward,191," Well, it's, uh, kind of hard to put into words.
",9
22617,Larry,191," Oh, I've been there, amigo.
",9
22618,Squidward,191," You have?
",9
22619,Larry,191," Sure. But nothing clears the sawdust out of your brains quicker than a ride on a jet ski.
",9
22620,Larry,191," Ever been on one of these little babies?
",9
22621,Squidward,191," Um, no. The.. They always seemed a little sporty for me.
",9
22622,Larry,191," Well, you only live once. And I just happen to have an extra helmet.
",9
22623,Squidward,191," What the heck?
",9
22624,Unnamed fish,191," Hey!
",9
22625,Squidward,191," We make quite a team!
",9
22626,Larry,191," I'll say!
",9
22627,Squidward,191," You know, earlier today I met a jerk who said he didn't like clarinet music.
",9
22628,Larry,191," Hey, you know that's very uncool. What kind of thoughtless ding-dong would knock another man's passion?
",9
22629,Squidward,191," You know, you're alright, Lester.
",9
22630,Larry,191," It's Larry.
",9
22631,Squidward,191," Whatever. The point is do you want to go with me to a gallery opening tonight?
",9
22632,Larry,191," Well, that's not my kind of thing at all, but for you sure. I'll just need to stop by the apartment and make myself a protein shake.
",9
22633,Squidward,191," What?! You don't need that glop!
",9
22634,Larry,191," Oh, I wouldn't call it ""glop"". Protein shake saved my life, bro.
",9
22635,Squidward,191," Oh, come on. It's a fat. You don't wanna be one of those mindless rubes who marches around in a constant haze of stupidity. ""I love protein shakes. I'm the most gullible rube on the planet. Duh! Duh! Duh! Give me my stupid protein shake.""
",9
22636,Squidward,191," [dumbfounded] I mean...
",9
22637,Squidward,191," So, are we still on for tonight? Sevenish?
",9
22638,Squidward,191," [sighs] I guess it's just you and me again.
",9
22639,Squidward,191," [scoffs] What are you doing here?
",9
22640,SpongeBob,191," [holds out his jump rope] Just playing draggy rope. You wanna play?
",9
22641,Squidward,191," No.
",9
22642,SpongeBob,191," You hold on to one end of the rope and you drag it behind you like a sea snake is chasing you like this. Wanna play?
",9
22643,Squidward,191," Just get me out of here!
",9
22644,SpongeBob,191," [silence] Will do.
",9
22645,Squidward,191," Thanks.
",9
22646,SpongeBob,191," Anything for a friend.
",9
22647,Squidward,191," Friend?
",9
22648,Squidward,191," Would you be my plus one?
",9
22649,Squidward,191," Come on, SpongeBob.
",9
22650,Perch Perkins,191," And here comes Squidward Tentacles and what must be either a bizarre piece of performance art or the saddest display of loneliness it has ever been my displeasure to report. One is inclined to suspect the second thing I said. A thing about sadness!
",9
22651,Squidward's reflection,191," You'll always be my plus one!
",9
22652,Squidward,191," Aww!

",9
22678,SpongeBob,192," Oh, I'm playing picnic with my wonderful little food friends Herb and Loretta! These are their kids Timmy and Sally.
",9
22679,Mr. Krabs,192," Mmm-hmm. Sounds to me like you're wasting me precious ingredients! Listen SpongeBob, just because there's no customers doesn't mean you can't do something productive.
",9
22680,SpongeBob,192," Like what, Mr. Krabs?
",9
22681,Mr. Krabs,192," Well, I mean you could, OH! You can dust the pickles! Or uh, alphabetize the buns! Ehhh, you could, uh... water down the ketchup!
",9
22682,SpongeBob,192," At this point it would be ketchuping up the water.
",9
22683,Mr. Krabs,192," Whatever. Now if these little fellers could work... maybe you'll be on to something... hey, you couldn't make me a little tiny army of unpaid workers, could ya?
",9
22684,SpongeBob,192," Well, I could try. [scoops off the burnt patties and puts a new one on] Here's a little worker. We'll call him Pete.
",9
22685,Mr. Krabs,192," Ohhohohohoo! Hi Pete!
",9
22686,Mr. Krabs,192," Hey, what's wrong with Pete? He's not working!
",9
22687,SpongeBob,192," Maybe Pete is just tired.
",9
22688,Mr. Krabs,192," Well now, that shouldn't interfere with Pete's work.
",9
22689,SpongeBob,192," Well, I don't know Mr. Krabs. [sprays ketchup on the productivity chart] I guess it might affect his productivity-
",9
22690,Mr. Krabs,192," [gasps] No! Not his productivity!
",9
22691,SpongeBob,192," Hey, maybe if Pete can go on a picnic like the Patty family, he might be rested and happy and more productive than ever!
",9
22692,Mr. Krabs,192," [gasps] No! Not leaving the workplace for pleasure!
",9
22693,SpongeBob,192," Hey! Maybe Pete's boss could have a company picnic and Pete could have a great time and relax and come back and work twice as hard!
",9
22694,Mr. Krabs,192," Company picnic?
",9
22695,SpongeBob,192," See, look! He's already perking up!
",9
22696,Mr. Krabs,192," Gee, SpongeBob. Do you think if I threw a picnic your productivity would increase?
",9
22697,SpongeBob,192," Definitely!
",9
22698,Squidward,192," [opens door] What's going on in here?
",9
22699,Mr. Krabs,192,"  Just in time, Mr. Squidward! You're about to go on the greatest company picnic ever!
",9
22700,Plankton,192," A company picnic, eh? That gives me an idea.
",9
22701,Squidward,192," This is the greatest company picnic ever?
",9
22702,Mr. Krabs,192," Yes, yes it is.
",9
22703,SpongeBob,192," Pace yourself Squidward, the fun is just getting started.
",9
22704,Squidward,192," Is this toilet paper we're sitting on?
",9
22705,Mr. Krabs,192," Oh, don't think of it as just toilet paper, it has thousands of uses.
",9
22706,SpongeBob,192," Here's one!
",9
22707,Squidward,192," Well, I guess things will pick up once the food gets here.
",9
22708,Mr. Krabs,192," Right you are! Here's the food! [points to a pile of condiment packs.]
",9
22709,Squidward,192," [picks up packet of mustard] What?
",9
22710,Mr. Krabs,192," Oh, you're confused? Let me show you a little hack. [bites a pack of mustard and opens it with his mouth.] See? You open it with your teeth. [puts mustard on a round piece of toilet paper.] There, isn't that fun? And afterwards, you can toss it around like a, you know, one of those things you toss around.
",9
22711,Mr. Krabs,192," Here let me show ya. Go out for a long one, SpongeBob!
",9
22712,SpongeBob,192," Going long!
",9
22713,Mr. Krabs,192," Ho, ho. This is so much fun.
",9
22714,SpongeBob,192," Is this far enough?
",9
22715,Mr. Krabs,192," I can't hear what you're sayin'! So... here it comes!
",9
22716,Mr. Krabs,192," [looks out] Hmm. Heh, I don't see it anywhere.
",9
22717,Squidward,192," I'm going home.
",9
22718,Mr. Krabs,192," [grabs Squidward] Oh no you're not. [sets him down] You're going to sit right there and enjoy yourself until your productivity increases!
",9
22719,Squidward,192," [grumbles]
",9
22720,SpongeBob,192," Oh boy! Facing painting! Great idea, Mr. Krabs. [licks some mustard from Squidward's face] Ahh. Here, let me try!
",9
22721,SpongeBob,192," Hi, I'm Barnacle Boy.
",9
22722,Mr. Krabs,192," Well, we sure had our fun and games today. But just maybe we've learned a little something too. About each other and ourselves. I guess you'd have to say, ""This was the greatest...""
",9
22723,Squidward,192," Do not say it!
",9
22724,Mr. Krabs,192," ""The greatest comp...""
",9
22725,Squidward,192," Don't!

22726,Mr. Krabs,192," [a rainbow appears] ""The greatest company picnic ever!""
",9
22727,Mr. Krabs,192," Well, looks like we've got company.
",9
22728,SpongeBob,192," Well, Mr. Krabs, it is a company picnic. [laughs]
",9
22729,Squidward,192," Well, this is more like it. You've been holding out on us, Mr. Krabs. You old devil.
",9
22730,Mr. Krabs,192," [laughs nervously] I have? Wait. Oh yeah.
",9
22731,Mr. Krabs,192," [reads the license plate on the van] ""Chumpany Picnic""? That's not how you spell ""Company Picnic""!
",9
22732,Plankton,192," [honks the horn] Guess who?
",9
22733,Mr. Krabs,192," Plankton!
",9
22734,Mr. Krabs,192," Just what do ya think you're doin', Plankton?
",9
22735,Plankton,192," Uh, what do you mean? I'm having my company picnic. This is our spot.
",9
22736,Mr. Krabs,192," Oh yeah! Well, it's my spot now!
",9
22737,Plankton,192," Come now. Can't we all just share? Nothing should spoil this perfect day.
",9
22738,SpongeBob,192," [happy] Aww!
",9
22739,Mr. Krabs,192," You don't even have any employees!
",9
22740,SpongeBob,192," [sad] Aww!
",9
22741,Plankton,192," Sure I do.
",9
22742,Plankton,192," Those are my new hired, Simmy and Tally. Just look at them tossing the disk around.
",9
22743,SpongeBob,192," A real disk?
",9
22744,Mr. Krabs,192," Ha! Go on, SpongeBob! Show this upstart how we chuck the old mustard plate around!
",9
22745,SpongeBob,192," Well. Eh.
",9
22746,Plankton,192," You're all welcome to join us of course. There's plenty of fun for all.
",9
22747,SpongeBob,192," Aw, no thanks, Plankton. We're having a great time at our own company picnic.
",9
22748,SpongeBob,192," Hey, Plankton. What are Simmy and Tally up too?
",9
22749,Plankton,192," Oh, just setting up the rest of the activities.
",9
22750,Plankton,192," The cotton candy machine, hot roasted peanuts, games of chance, bottles you can knock over to win a prize, the world's most exciting roller coaster, a deep fryer for delicacies...
",9
22751,Squidward,192," Delicacies?
",9
22752,Plankton,192," And of course, the dunking booth!
",9
22753,Plankton,192," [turns SpongeBob around] Have you seen the calliope?
",9
22754,SpongeBob,192," Aww!
",9
22755,Mr. Krabs,192," Now, look here, Plankton! Me loyal employees would never be takin' in by such a shallow display...
",9
22756,Squidward,192," One side, Goopy!
",9
22757,SpongeBob,192," Yum.
",9
22758,Mr. Krabs,192," Is this backwards? [grunts] Oh, that's not it either.
",9
22759,Plankton,192," You were saying, Krabs? [laughs]
",9
22760,SpongeBob,192," [angry] Mr. Krabs is right, Plankton. We're having lots of fun. Come on, Mr. Krabs.
",9
22761,Mr. Krabs,192," SpongeBob, would you mind helpin' me with my zipper?
",9
22762,SpongeBob,192," Who needs them? Right, Mr. Krabs?
",9
22763,Mr. Krabs,192," Huh? Yeah, yeah. Sure.
",9
22764,Squidward,192," [offscreen] Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! [laughs]
",9
22765,SpongeBob,192," [holds up some condiments] You want me to paint your face?
",9
22766,Mr. Krabs,192," Well, I don't know.
",9
22767,SpongeBob,192," Alright. I'm making you into, um, a ghost.
",9
22768,Mr. Krabs,192," [sniffs] Ooh. I think this mayo has gone bad.
",9
22769,SpongeBob,192," [eerily] Ooh. The ghost of mayonnaise bad! That really scares people.
",9
22770,Mr. Krabs,192," Yeah. [laughs nervously]
",9
22771,Simmy,192," Whoa! Stop! That is almost too much cotton candy!
",9
22772,Mr. Krabs,192," You wanna join in all that fun over there with Mr. Squidward, don't ya?
",9
22773,SpongeBob,192," No. Course not.
",9
22774,Mr. Krabs,192," Are you sure you don't want to?
",9
22775,SpongeBob,192," Mr. Krabs, I am staying right here at the Krusty Krab picnic!
",9
22776,Mr. Krabs,192," You sure?
",9
22777,SpongeBob,192," 100% sure, Mr. Krabs!
",9
22778,Mr. Krabs,192," Ok, then. I'm outta here! See ya! Yahoo!
",9
22779,Mr. Krabs,192," [gasps] You can never have too many!
",9
22780,Squidward,192," Whoo!
",9
22781,Mr. Krabs,192," Hey, Squiddie-bird!
",9
22782,SpongeBob,192," Whoo! [picks up the mustard plate but drops it] Having lots of fun over here. I've got a plate! It's made of paper!
",9
22783,SpongeBob,192," It's a paper plate. Whoo! [throws plate and drops it]
",9
22784,SpongeBob,192," Well, if it's good enough for Mr. Krabs, it's good enough for me.
",9
22785,Squidward,192," I have to say, Mr. Plankton. If this is how you treat your employees...
",9
22786,Plankton,192," Say no more, my friend. [holds out contract] If you'd care to work for me, just sign this contract with this delicious candied pen.
",9
22787,Mr. Krabs,192," Ooh! [grabs the pen and contract] Me first! Me first!
",9
22788,Plankton,192," Oh, don't bother to read it. Not on such a fun day.
",9
22789,Mr. Krabs,192," That's such great advice!
",9
22790,Plankton,192," This is working far better than I planned! With Krabs as my employee, I can order him to give me the Krabby Patty formula and the Krusty Krab will be no more! [laughs evilly]
",9
22791,SpongeBob,192," Ahem! Hello, Plankton!
",9
22792,Plankton,192," Uh oh.
",9
22793,SpongeBob,192," Mr. Krabs, don't sign it!
",9
22794,Mr. Krabs,192," My candied pen!
",9
22795,SpongeBob,192," [in slow motion] Simmy, look out! There's a candied pen heading straight for your eye due to my act of swatting it away without first considering the trajectory! Oh, I wish I could give my words out faster, but everything's in slow motion!
",9
22796,SpongeBob,192," [in slow motion] No!!!
",9
22797,SpongeBob,192," Simmy and Tally are holograms? Then that means...
",9
22798,Squidward,192," I was riding that? What about those delicacies I was eating?
",9
22799,Mr. Krabs,192," Whew! That was a cl...

22802,Plankton,192," Unbelievable!

22803,Plankton,192," Uh oh.

",9
22839,Frankie Billy,193," Thanks, pal. You're a lifesaver.
",9
22840,Patrick,193," That's a pretty good thing I thought of. Huh? Well...
",9
22841,SpongeBob,193," I'll call you...
",9
22842,SpongeBob,193," Dani.
",9
22843,SpongeBob,193," Oh. Uh, excuse me. Pardon me. Uh, just a minute!
",9
22844,Nat Peterson,193," Thanks, Snailguy!
",9
22845,SpongeBob,193," Three bags of snail chow. Four bags of snail litter.
",9
22846,Sadie,193," Thanks, Snailguy!
",9
22847,SpongeBob,193," Uh, you're welcome?
",9
22848,SpongeBob,193," Ok, would you guys just relax? You're all gonna get fed. Dani, keep out of Walter's dish. Obulax, what are you doing? Cheryl, Henry, no fighting.
",9
22849,SpongeBob,193," Geez, my pants are getting ruined and my head is sticky. I gotta do something about that.
",9
22850,Mr. Krabs,193," Squidward, why aren't you taking orders from these good people?
",9
22851,Squidward,193," I would, but what's the point? There's no one to make the food.
",9
22852,Mr. Krabs,193," [stutters] What?! Where's SpongeBob?
",9
22853,Squidward,193," Let me think. No idea.
",9
22854,Mr. Krabs,193," Then you'll have to do SpongeBob's job too!
",9
22855,Squidward,193," I can't do that!
",9
22856,Mr. Krabs,193," Of course you can. Any idiot can do it. Now, get to work! I'm gonna go find SpongeBob!
",9
22857,Squidward,193," Alright, alright! Calm down, everybody! I'm here to take your order!
",9
22858,SpongeBob,193," Yes?
",9
22859,Mr. Krabs,193," Ooh, excuse me, me lovely. Maybe I've got the wrong house here. But I can't say I'm disappointed. I was thinkin' of me old matey SpongeBob...
",9
22860,SpongeBob,193," Oh, hey, Mr. Krabs.
",9
22861,Mr. Krabs,193," [stutters] SpongeBob? That's you, boy? Why aren't you at work? And why are you all dressed up like a nanny puppet subsea hooligowl?
",9
22862,SpongeBob,193," Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. But I'm so busy taking care of these snails. I'll try to come in tomorrow.
",9
22863,Mr. Krabs,193," You try?! Listen up, me boy-oh! You'll do more than try! You'll...
",9
22864,SpongeBob,193," Down, Vince! You leave Electric Ronnie alone! Mr. Buster, get off that shelf! Nothing today, thank you! Bye, Mr. Krabs!
",9
22865,Squidward,193," [sniff] I can't believe that I had to do my job's and SpongeBob's. [sneezes as he enters his house]
",9
22866,French Narrator,193," The next morning...
",9
22867,Squidward,193," What the? [notices the slime and sneeze] Oh, it's not a cold, it's my allergies.
",9
22868,Squidward,193," Hey, lady!
",9
22869,SpongeBob,193," Huh?
",9
22870,Squidward,193," [freaks out] SpongeBob, is that you?
",9
22871,SpongeBob,193," I don't know. [gives a bowl of food to a snail]
",9
22872,Squidward,193," What happened to you? And where did all these snails come from?!
",9
22873,SpongeBob,193," Don't worry. I'm taking very good care of all my snails. [gives a bowl of food to another snail]
",9
22874,Squidward,193," I'm not worried about them, I'm worried about me! I'm allergic to snails!
",9
22875,SpongeBob,193," Even Gary? [gives a bowl of food to another snail, but ended up hitting Squidward's stomach.]
",9
22876,Squidward,193," One snail I can handle. Maybe even two or three. But this? Geesh, no way! Just how many snails do you have?
",9
22877,SpongeBob,193," I don't know. Let's count them shall we. One, two, three, Mary, Dani, Carmela, Señor Poopus, Jack, twenty-four, Paul, Brenda, Cheryl, Steve, One that keeps barfing on the floor, forty-eight, [as SpongeBob mutters more names, Squidward gets angry.] Obulax, Vince, Mavis, Mavis Jr. Electric Ronnie, Dianne, Pam, Ninety-seven, Walter, Sarah, Bugaloo Shrimp, [Squidward gets more angry.] a hundred forty-one, Viva, Tom, Thea, Ava, that's a hundred sixty-four, Old Ironsides, [Squidward gets a lot more angrier.], Rhonda, Papa Pup, He Who Shall Not Be Named, two hundred thirty-three, Sean, Andy, Mr. Buster, Mrs. Buster, I'll say two hundred fifty-eight!
",9
22878,Squidward,193," [grumbles a lot more angrier] Enough! You have to get rid of those snails and get back to work!
",9
22879,SpongeBob,193," Work? But I've found my life's work. Taking care of wayward snails. [a snail crawls over his body.]
",9
22880,Squidward,193," [furious] That's it!! I'm calling the Bikini Bottom officials so they can deal with it!
",9
22881,Squidward,193," He said like two hundred and fifty-eight! Well, do something about it! That's why I pay taxes! [hangs up the phone.] Oh, my allergies are killing me.
",9
22882,Harold,193," Uh, hello? Hey, man. I'm super hungry. Where's my food, dude?
",9
22883,Squidward,193," Oh, chill your gills! I'll get your food, dude!
",9
22884,Harold,193," Uh, I'm not so super hungry all of a sudden. And also, I'm super not paying!
",9
22885,Mr. Krabs,193," Squidward, have you lost your ever lovin' mind? You cannot be sneezin' all over me Krabby Patties! The customers don't like it. Except for that guy.
",9
22886,Squidward,193," That's it. I'm done.
",9
22887,Mr. Krabs,193," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! You can't abandon ship! I have to work all by meself!
",9
22888,Squidward,193," [sarcastically] Don't worry, it's not a problem! Any idiot can do it, right?
",9
22889,Mr. Krabs,193," Right.
",9
22890,Patrick,193," Well, if it's snail friends he wants, it's a snail friend he's gonna get.
",9
22891,Patrick,193," Meow.
",9
22892,SpongeBob,193," Oh, another little stray friend. What is your name little fellow?
",9
22893,Patrick,193," It's Patrick! Um, Meow!
",9
22894,SpongeBob,193," I think I'll call you Patrick.
",9
22895,SpongeBob,193," No, no, you dirty boy. You need a bath.
",9
22896,Patrick,193," Meow, no! No, meow!
",9
22897,SpongeBob,193," Uh, hello, police.
",9
22898,Pet Control Police,193," Excuse me, ma'am. But we've had some complaints...
",9
22899,SpongeBob,193," [laughs] No, thank you, please. [Patrick attempts to leave the house but SpongeBob grabs him.] Oh no, Patrick. No outsidies for you. [SpongeBob drags him back in.]
",9
22900,Patrick,193," Meow, help! Meow, help! [SpongeBob closes the door]
",9
22901,Squidward,193," He said, ""No, thank you, please""? What does that even mean? I demand that you do something about those snails, now!
",9
22902,Squidward,193," Oh, this has got to stop!
",9
22903,SpongeBob,193," Oh, the bad men want to take you away from me. But I won't let them.
",9
22904,SpongeBob,193," [Gets up and talks with his mouth full of sand.] Sanctuary! Sanctuary! Everybody in! Everybody in!
",9
22905,Pet Control Police,193," SpongeBob is behind that fence and he has locked the gate.
",9
22906,Squidward,193," [bloated, walks up agitated] Oh, quit messin' around and just break down the gate!
",9
22907,Bob Barnacle,193," [calmly] Wait. Maybe there's another way. Get me a bullhorn. I wanna talk to her.
",9
22908,Pet Control Police,193," Him.
",9
22909,Bob Barnacle,193," Oh, right. Him. [The Pet Control Police gives Bob a bullhorn and begins talking through it.] SpongeBob, I need you to listen to me!
",9
22910,SpongeBob,193," Hello.
",9
22911,Bob Barnacle,193," SpongeBob, my name is Bob Barnacle. I run the Bob Barnacle Snail Rescue Center. These snails all got loose through a hole in the fence of my snail center. I'm here to help the snails. I'm here to help you.
",9
22912,SpongeBob,193," Hello.
",9
22913,Bob Barnacle,193," I know that you mean well, but there's only so much one sponge can do. You must be very tired from all your hard work.
",9
22914,Bob Barnacle,193," My center has all the space and staff that a snail needs. They'll be well taken care of.
",9
22915,Bob Barnacle,193," I promise. The snails will be happy.
",9
22916,Bob Barnacle,193," Esmerelda!
",9
22917,SpongeBob,193," Esmerelda?
",9
22918,Bob Barnacle,193," Yes, that's her name! What did you call her?
",9
22919,SpongeBob,193," [embarrassed] Señor Poopus. [laughs]
",9
22920,SpongeBob,193," So long! I'm gonna miss you guys. Especially you, Señor Poopus. [laughs] I mean Señorita Esmerelda.
",9
22921,Bob Barnacle,193," You did the right thing. You can visit the snail center anytime.
",9
22922,SpongeBob,193," Thanks, Bob. We will. But I'm going back to being a one snail guy. That's the way I like it.
",9
22923,Gary,193," Meow.
",9
22924,Bob Barnacle,193," Don't forget to get your pet spayed or neutered.
",9
22925,Patrick,193," Bye, SpongeBob.
",9
22926,SpongeBob,193," Bye, Patrick.

22934,Patrick,194," I don't get it! What's an audit?
",9
22935,SpongeBob,194," I don't know. Let me check the rules. [drops the giant rule book on the ground, opening it] Playing ""Certified Public Accountant"" isn't as much fun as I thought. [he slides the book away] Maybe it'll be funner if we play louder!
",9
22936,Patrick,194," [grabs the dice, shaking it] I am rolling the dice! [he rolls the dice] Now I am moving! [he picks up a piece and puts it in another spot, picking up a card] ""Run...Spreadsheets""?
",9
22937,SpongeBob,194," What does that even mean?! [As SpongeBob is talking, the screen goes over to Squidward, who is sunbathing. Squidward, annoyed by their shouting, turns up the volume on his iPod.]
",9
22938,Patrick,194," Well, maybe I'm supposed to run around with this sheet we spread on the ground!
",9
22939,SpongeBob,194," Yeah, that sounds right to me!
",9
22940,SpongeBob,194," Hey, Squidward. Wanna play ""Certified Public Accountant"" with us?
",9
22941,Squidward,194," Oh, let me think. That sounds so no!
",9
22942,Patrick,194," I don't think this game is ripe.
",9
22943,SpongeBob,194," Yeah, maybe it got picked too soon.
",9
22944,Squidward,194," [scoffs] What? Do you think that games grow on trees? [laughs]
",9
22945,Patrick,194," Doesn't everything grow on trees?
",9
22946,Squidward,194," No, you ninny! Somebody makes them.
",9
22947,Patrick,194," Makes them?
",9
22948,Squidward,194," Yeah. Somebody thinks up the game, then they make the game.
",9
22949,Patrick,194," Then I could make a game?
",9
22950,Squidward,194," No, you couldn't. You would be incapable.
",9
22951,SpongeBob,194," Well, I think Patrick could make up a game.
",9
22952,Squidward,194," Your operative word there is think.
",9
22953,Patrick,194," Yeah! The opernive... word is think! [laughs] Thanks, Squidward! I'll do it!
",9
22954,SpongeBob,194," Go get'em, Patrick!
",9
22955,Squidward,194," [sighs as he rubs his head] Double morons.
",9
22956,Patrick,194," I invented a game! I invented a game!
",9
22957,Squidward,194," Whoopee. Do tell.
",9
22958,Patrick,194," Well, you know how hard ""Tic-Tac-Toe"" is and how it always takes so long to play?
",9
22959,Squidward,194," Uh-huh.
",9
22960,Patrick,194," Yeah! Well, I made it easier and faster!
",9
22961,Squidward,194," [sighs] I know I'm gonna hate myself for saying this, but what have you got?
",9
22962,Patrick,194," It's called... [hold out a notebook] ""Tic-Tac""! You start with two lines that are crossed. And then the first person puts an X. And then the next person puts an, uh... [thinks]
",9
22963,Squidward,194," O?
",9
22964,Patrick,194," Oh, yeah! An O! And the first person to get two in a row draws a line through them and says, ""Tic-Tac""!. [rips off paper and laughs] You start!
",9
22965,Squidward,194," Tic-Tac.
",9
22966,Patrick,194," Uh... [rips off paper] Best two out of four?
",9
22967,French Narrator,194," Many Tic-Tacs later...
",9
22968,Squidward,194," Tic and Tac.
",9
22969,Patrick,194," Squidward, I got a new game! It's called ""Rock, Paper, Butter""!
",9
22970,Squidward,194," Butterin' than the different game? [laughs]
",9
22971,Patrick,194," Squidward, I got it! [throws the ropes on the ground] Whose rope is longer? You... [Squidward picks up the long rope before Patrick finishes] Aww! You played this before!
",9
22972,Patrick,194," Sandy, I've been trying to invent a game, but every game I invent is a failure.
",9
22973,Sandy,194," [puts some stuff in her blender] If you want to invent a game, you should study all the games you like and figure out what it is you liked best about them. [mixes her blender] Then you can use those elements in the game you invent. [drinks her smoothie she made from her blender]
",9
22974,Patrick,194," [gasps] I know what to do!
",9
22975,Patrick,194," And so it begins.
",9
22976,Patrick,194," [laughs maniacally] It's a game! It's a game! Now I know what it's like to be a game maker!
",9
22977,Squidward,194," I don't see the point to this game night. Every game that Patrick has ""invented"" is more pointless and boring than the last.
",9
22978,Sandy,194," This time, he did research.
",9
22979,Squidward,194," Well, if it's started, then I'm already bored.
",9
22980,Sandy,194," Well, I'm excited! We're gonna be the first people to test out Patrick's game!
",9
22981,SpongeBob,194," This is gonna be written about it in the history book someday.
",9
22982,Squidward,194," Yeah. In crayon.
",9
22983,Patrick,194," Good evening. Please step into my gamatourium.
",9
22984,Squidward,194," More like a lamatourium. Ha.
",9
22985,Patrick,194," Welcome, gamers! And behold! [thunderclaps] My game!
",9
22986,SpongeBob,194," It's beautiful!
",9
22987,Squidward,194," [yawns] Are we finished? Who won? [Sandy, disgusted by Squidward's rude behavior, hits Squidward's arm]
",9
22988,Patrick,194," [laughs] No, my friend. We have only just begun.
",9
22989,Sandy,194," What's it called, Patrick?
",9
22990,Squidward,194," Might I suggest ""garbage""? [Sandy growls at Squidward] What?
",9
22991,SpongeBob,194," Yeah, Patrick. What's it called?
",9
22992,Patrick,194," It's called... Patrick! The Game! [thunderclaps]
",9
22993,SpongeBob,194," Wow!
",9
22994,Squidward,194," Could we just get started already? I'm late for my coma. [Sandy zips Squidward's mouth shut]
",9
22995,Patrick,194," Alright! [eats some snacks] I'll explain the rules. Each player picks a piece to move around the board. The way you decide which player gets to pick the piece by rolling the dice. [As Patrick explains, Sandy and SpongeBob are amazed. But Squidward, on the other hand, was getting impatient] To decide who gets to roll the dice first to see who gets the first choice of players, you have to be...
",9
22996,Squidward,194," Look, Patrick! You go, then Sandy, then SpongeBob, then me! Okay?
",9
22997,Patrick,194," You mean for picking our player or for starting the game?
",9
22998,Squidward,194," [annoyed] Both!
",9
22999,Patrick,194," Ok! Now, onto rules of how to play the game.
",9
23000,Squidward,194," I've got a great idea. Why don't we just start rolling and you can explain the game as we play.
",9
23001,Patrick,194," Hmm... [thinks] Okay! [Patrick rolls the dice and gets three dots. He moves his game piece and lands on free money.] Oh, money!! [throw money in the air]
",9
23002,Sandy,194," Yee-haw! Beach broad property! [places a house shaped piece on Goo Lagoon]
",9
23003,SpongeBob,194," Driver's license! Driver's license! But what does that mean?
",9
23004,Patrick,194," Oh, on your next turn, you roll then you can move down the board or you can go round the race track as many times as you rolled.
",9
23005,SpongeBob,194," Oh, what should I do? What should I do? What should I do?
",9
23006,Squidward,194," Could you give me the dice? Give me the dice? Because it's my turn!
",9
23007,Squidward,194," Uh-huh.
",9
23008,Patrick,194," You go to jail.
",9
23009,Blue Cellmate,194," What are you in for, pal?
",9
23010,Patrick,194," My turn! [rolls the dice and spits it out of his mouth] One... two...
",9
23011,Squidward,194," Oh, good thing you've landed on snacks. You must be famished.
",9
23012,Sandy,194," Hmm... Coral Avenue. I'll buy it!
",9
23013,SpongeBob,194," Twelve. I'll... drive the car!
",9
23014,Patrick,194," Oh, you don't get to roll when you're in jail.
",9
23015,Squidward,194," Well, what do I do to get out of jail?
",9
23016,Patrick,194," You have to roll a six.
",9
23017,Patrick,194," Hey! You can't roll the dice when you're in jail!
",9
23018,SpongeBob,194," Yeah, play by the rules.
",9
23019,Squidward,194," Well, if the only way to get out of jail is to roll a six! And I can't roll if I'm in jail! Just how am I supposed to get out of jail?! Grrr!
",9
23020,Patrick,194," [Patrick pulls out a rule card.] Ah, here it is! [writes on it] The guy that is in jail has to stay there unless he rolls a six or someone says his name.
",9
23021,Squidward,194," [calmly] Fine. Someone say my name.
",9
23022,Patrick,194," Oh boy! You landed on ""Do a Surgery""! [Patrick holds cards while wearing an operation mask.] Now, pick a surgery card.
",9
23023,Sandy,194," [Sandy takes a card] Hmm... Remove finbone from player to your left.
",9
23024,Squidward,194," What? Wait! No! But I don't have a finbone! I'm an octopus!
",9
23025,Sandy,194," Hush, now! This won't hurt a bit.
",9
23026,Sandy,194," Got it.
",9
23027,Patrick,194," Now, sit back down, you criminal!
",9
23028,Squidward,194," Oh, this game doesn't make any sense!
",9
23029,SpongeBob,194," Sounds like someone's mad because he hasn't moved.
",9
23030,Squidward,194," Well, neither have you.
",9
23031,Squidward,194," [takes off the cardboard box] That's it! I've had enough!
",9
23032,SpongeBob,194," Come on, Squidward! Wait!
",9
23033,Sandy,194," Don't go, Squidward!
",9
23034,Patrick,194," No wait, Squidward!
",9
23035,SpongeBob,194," Squidward!
",9
23036,Patrick,194," Wait, how'd he get out of jail?
",9
23037,SpongeBob,194," Squidward made us say his name.
",9
23038,Sandy,194," That was a smart move, Squidward!
",9
23039,Squidward,194," Huh? Oh. Hmm... [thinks for a bit and goes back to playing]
",9
23040,SpongeBob,194," Now you roll after me.
",9
23041,SpongeBob,194," Five. One, two, three, four, five. Um, I think I'll...
",9
23042,Squidward,194," Race the car.
",9
23043,SpongeBob,194," I'll...
",9
23044,Squidward,194," Race the car!
",9
23045,SpongeBob,194," I'll... race the car!
",9
23046,Squidward,194," Oh boy! Snacks!
",9
23047,Patrick,194," Jail for Squidward!
",9
23048,Squidward,194," But I was on snacks!
",9
23049,Patrick,194," Tell it to the judge!
",9
23050,Squidward,194," Could someone please tell me what we are supposed to be doing? What's the point? This entire game is completely random! It jumps from one thing to another! I don't know how you are supposed to win! And Patrick seems to be making up the rules as he goes along!
",9
23051,Patrick,194," Starving! Starving sea star time!
",9
23052,Squidward,194," [takes off the box] Okay, I'm going outside.
",9
23053,Patrick,194," [Patrick writes on his rule card.] If a person declares outsidies, then everyone must go outside.
",9
23054,Squidward,194," But I didn't say ""outsidies"" I said...
",9
23055,Patrick,194," Four. We are in a giggle zone! Everyone laugh!
",9

",9
23149,SpongeBob,195," I don't get it. We have been staring at this table for three hours. That table could use a cleaning.

",9
23172,Ticketman,195," I'm sorry, you can't come in. This movie is too silly for a cultivated gentleman of your pant length. House rules! [SpongeBob walks over to movie poster]
",9
23173,SpongeBob,195," What? Rated for those in knee-highs only? Doh! I hate these pants! [tries to undo zipper, grunts while doing] [SpongeBob runs to a parking meter and puts his longpants on it, and and stretches his pants] Get off!

",9
23506,Pearl,197," Well, I don't care what you think anymore anyway. I'm being true to myself, and--and that's all that matters!
",9
23507,All,197," Eh.
",9
23508,Pearl,197," I'm a grandma now. Right, Beatrice?
",9
23509,Beatrice,197," Oh, Pearl, I'm so glad you enjoy being a grandma, but your friends make a good point.
",9
23510,Beatrice,197," You're only young once, you see. You don't want to grow up too fast or you'll miss out on all the fun.
",9
23511,Pearl,197," I guess you're right. Being a grandma is nice and all, but i do miss being a super hip young person.
",9
23512,Beatrice,197," Go have yourself some fun, my dear. Ah, ah, ah, ah.
",9
23513,Beatrice,197," How 'about a nice, gentle handshake instead? [groans]

23538,SpongeBob,198," [Reads a dictionary probably to understand what poppin' peripheral means] I am? Oh, thank you, Mr. Sharkface. Who are your friends?

23562,SpongeBob,198," [gasps] Are they okay?
",9
23563,Sharkface,198," Aw, don't worry about them Bettys, it's a waste of time.

23564,SpongeBob,198," Yeah, but what if they're hurt?

23565,Sharkface,198," I told you not to worry, but you keep on worrying.

23566,Lonnie,198," Pull your chair, Sponge.

23569,Food Vendor,198," Please, have whatever you want! Take it all! Take it all! [ throws fruit into Shark Lightning]
",9
23570,SpongeBob,198," [pops out of fruit] That guy seemed really scared of us.

23571,Sharkface,198," That guy's looney.
",9
23572,Ronnie,198," Hey, SpongePants, don't be such a maybe baby.

23577,Howlin Marlin Bouncer,198," Not after what you did last time, you wrecked the joint! [ pulls out a sign] This is a shark free zone now.

23578,Donnie,198," What a bunch of hooie.
",9
23579,Ronnie,198," Yeah, what are we gonna do Sharkface?
",9
23580,Lonnie,198," The Sharks can't allow this. [all of them] Yeah, yeah.
",9
23581,SpongeBob,198," Um, you know maybe we should let it slide, there are plenty of clubs in the sea.
",9
23582,Sharkface,198," Slow down, this is our spot. Sponge. Huh? [hears suction cup sounds, zoom into his lips.] The Pods.
",9
23583,SpongeBob,198," The whats?
",9
23584,Lonnie,198," It's our rivals.
",9
23585,The Sharks,198," The Pods!
",9
23586,The Pods,198," Pods.
",9
23587,The Sharks,198," Sharks.

23588,The Pods,198," Pods.

",9
23591,The Sharks,198," Sharks!
",9
23592,SpongeBob,198," The cops! [sighs in relief]
",9
23593,Officer John,198," Hold it there laddies, break this nonsense up right now.
",9
23594,Nancy O'Malley,198," Now you Pods clear out of here!
",9
23595,Pod #1,198," Hey, we'll see you at the showdown, Sharks... [they put their suction cups together to make it sound like snapping again, but this time, all together.] ...unless you're a bunch of jellies. [laughs and drives their scooter.]
",9
23596,Sharkface,198," We're gonna be there! And we're no jellies!
",9
23597,Officer John,198," Not so fast there, boy'o. There won't be a showdown. You lads know that's our turf.
",9
23598,Officer Nancy,198," Stay off our beat. This is your final warning. [they exit]
",9
23599,Lonnie,198," Cops, [drops throws toothpick on the ground and steps on it] always breathin' down our necks.
",9
23600,SpongeBob,198," Well I'm glad that's all cleared up.
",9
23601,Sharkface,198," Your right Sponge, we got a showdown to get ready for.
",9
23602,SpongeBob,198," Oh uh, didn't you hear, the nice officers said there won't be a showdown.
",9
23603,Sharkface,198," Forget the cops, it's the Pods we need to take down, and we can do that because we got you on our side.
",9
23604,SpongeBob,198," Uh, me? You know i'm not really the showdown type.
",9
23605,Donnie,198," I thought he was one of us!
",9
23606,Lonnie,198," Yeah, a Shark.
",9
23607,SpongeBob,198," [falls down] I was just caught up in the moment, I just love making new friends.
",9
23608,Sharkface,198," Do not shrimp out on us Sponge-o. The showdown is at the playground, tonight! so were gonna see you there, right?
",9
23609,SpongeBob,198," Um, [gets off dust on his jacket and says nervously.] oh okay see you guys there. Bye.
",9
23610,Sharkface,198," Don't disappoint us Sponge. [The Sharks drive away in the Shark Lightning.]
",9
23611,SpongeBob,198," Showdown? I can't fight in a showdown! I'll have to go into the Witness Protection program, [goes to pictures of The Krusty Krab] i'll have to quit working at The Krusty Krab, i'll never flip a succulent Krabby Patty ever again. Oh what have I done? [notices a note next to Gary's food bowl and picks it up and reads it.] Hey yo Sponge-o, we were in your neck of the woods and decided to pickup your beloved pet Gary, if you wanna see him you better hightail your porous caboose over to the showdown, sincerely Sharkface and the other Sharks, Gary! No! [runs through the wall and runs out of his house, but runs back and breaks through the door.] I have to save Gary, I have to go to the showdown! I have to get ready to fight! [puts on shades]
",9
23612,SpongeBob,198," I'm ready!
",9
23613,SpongeBob,198," I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready! Back up Pods, don't make me hurt you!
",9
23614,Squidward,198," SpongeBob, what are you doing here?
",9
23615,SpongeBob,198," Squidward?! Oh no, I accidentally joined this bad boy gang and i'm suppose to fight in the showdown so I got to save Gary, and I don't wanna go into the Witness Protection program, but I can't fight cause you're my friend.
",9
23616,Squidward,198," What are you talking about, jellyfish for brains! We are a troupe. [goes into a pose along with the other Pods.]
",9
23617,SpongeBob,198," A troupe? What do you mean?
",9
23618,Squidward,198," A dance troupe, you numb-skull! This is a dance showdown. No one is going to fight!
",9
23619,SpongeBob,198," [drops his spatulas and shades.] But what about those girls that screamed and fainted?
",9
23620,Lonnie,198," Oh that, that's just our fans, they scream and faint all the time. [points to the back where the fans are.]
",9
23621,Fans,198," We love you!
",9
23622,SpongeBob,198," What about the fruit vendor? He just gave you his fruit and ran away!
",9
23623,Donnie,198," That guy's a health nut, he's always worried we don't eat enough fruits.
",9
23624,Food Vendor,198," It keeps you regular! [throws an apple into Donnie's mouth.]
",9
23625,SpongeBob,198," But what about the club? The bouncer said you destroyed the place.
",9
23626,Sharkface,198," That was a total accident, that's how we lost, Jonnie. [shows Jonnie dancing.] Jonnie thought he could do a quadruple pirouette, he lost control he fell down, [shows Jonnie falling down and scratching up the floor with his teeth.] he scratched up the floor pretty bad, he won't be able to dance in days, maybe even a week!
",9
23627,"Lonnie, Ronnie, Donnie,",198," Jonnie no!
",9
23628,Squidward,198," Oh brother.
",9
23629,SpongeBob,198," But, you Sharks kidnapped Gary!
",9
23630,Sharkface,198," We would never do such a thing!
",9
23631,Lonnie,198," Yeah, we were just giving him a ride, Gary's our DJ.
",9
23632,Gary,198," Meow.
",9
23633,SpongeBob,198," Yay! I'm not a criminal by association.
",9
23634,Squidward,198," Will you stop yapping already.
",9
23635,SpongeBob,198," Your right Squidward, Gary, lay down some tunes!
",9
23636,Gary,198," Meow. [picks up CD and puts it in the player.]
",9
23637,SpongeBob,198," Oh no! It's the coppers!
",9
23638,Officer John,198," We told you to stay off our turf lads!
",9
23639,SpongeBob,198," I'm so sorry officer, we were just dancing.
",9
23640,Nancy O'Malley,198," You call that dancing, move aside boy'os, this here is our beat.
",9
23641,Officer John,198," [while spinning around torches.] Oh no, it's internal affairs!
",9
23642,Internal Affairs Agent #1,198," We're shutting you dirty dancing cops down.
",9
23643,Internal Affairs Agent #2,198," It's time to pop it,[puts on hat.] and lock it.
",9
23644,Sharkface,198," It's all over, nobody can defeat, Internal Affairs.
",9
23645,SpongeBob,198," Ooh, leave it to the sponge. Hey yo. [Kung Fu Rock starts playing and SpongeBob dances with his own style and then SpongeBob jumps into a slide and jumps over the Sharks and they start walking forward and snap.]
",9
23646,Mr. Krabs,198," And the winner is... SpongeBob Squarepants and the Sharks! [they take the trophy and start cheering.]
",9
23647,Patrick,198," We saved the rec center!
",9
23648,Squidward,198," What rec center.
",9
23649,SpongeBob,198," Now everybody's a winner.
",9
23650,All of Them,198," [all of them go into a freeze frame kind of pose with them jumping up and they say.] Yay!

",9
23664,Nick,199," You heard me, I wanna buy your home!
",9
23665,Patrick,199," But my home's not for sale.
",9

",9
23670,SpongeBob,199," A forever hike?
",9
23671,Patrick,199," Yeah. All because of Nick Fishkins.
",9
23672,SpongeBob,199," Who's Nick Fishkins?
",9
23673,Patrick,199," He shows up on television, and buys your home and there's nothing you can do about it. [saddened] Now I am doomed to walk the seas without a home.
",9
23674,SpongeBob,199," Aw, don't worry, Patrick, you can move in with me. We'll be roommates!
",9
23675,Patrick,199," Wow!
",9
23676,Nick,199," I'm Nick Fishkins and I wanna buy your home! Sold!
",9
23677,SpongeBob,199," Well, we might as well spend the night here. [takes Gary off his head]It's not so bad. We could make a home out of all this trash!
",9
23678,Patrick,199," [inside a broken bathtub while holding a steering wheel] Don't forget to make a garage for our new boat! [laughs]
",9
23679,Squidward,199," [he wakes up from his slumber, only to realize something is strange] Hm? Huh, how strange. Usually I wake up each morning with a dark feeling of dread gnawing at my stomach. But today, I feel positively...happy! [scene transition to Squidward walking happily with a rainbow over his head, singing] ♪Smilin' rainbows, smilin' sun, smilin' rocks, and vegetation! Look ma, I'm dancing, and hear my song! The world is lovely when nothing is wrong! Everything's smiling, yes even me! Is this what they call feeling happy?!♪ [he walks through the Krusty Krab, where Mr. Krabs is grabbing a trash bag from the trash can. As Squidward walks by happily, he takes Mr. Krabs arm holding the trash. He proceeds to walk to the dumpster]
",9
23680,SpongeBob,199," [offscreen] Morning, Squidward!
",9
23681,Squidward,199," Good morning, SpongeBob! [he tosses the trash and Mr. Krabs arm into the dumpster. As he proceeds to walk back into the Krusty Krab, he stops and realizes why he was so happy] Oh, that's why I felt great this morning, there was no SpongeBob.
",9
23682,Patrick,199," [offscreen] Hi, Squidward!
",9
23683,Squidward,199," [he sees SpongeBob, Patrick, Gary, looking like wrecks, relaxing around their newly-built house of trash] Oh, what did you numbskulls do with the trash?
",9
23684,SpongeBob,199," [the camera zooms out to reveal the entire house] Built a house. [a table holding a barrel, two pillows, and a photo falls over]
",9
23685,Squidward,199," What the -- why?
",9
23686,Patrick,199," Cause Nick Fishkins bought my home and then he bought SpongeBob's home.
",9
23687,SpongeBob,199," So now we live here.
",9
23688,Squidward,199," Oh, why didn't you just use the money that Nick Fishkins gave you to rent a room or buy a new home?
",9
23689,Patrick,199," Well, he hasn't paid us yet!
",9
23690,SpongeBob,199," Yeah, he said it right on the TV, ""I wanna buy your home!"" But we haven't seen any money!
",9
23691,Squidward,199," Ohhh...let me get this straight. You saw a TV commercial of Nick Fishkins saying he would buy your home and without meeting him or signing anything, you believe your homes have been sold? Now doesn't that seem weird, even to you?
",9
23692,Patrick,199," Really weird!
",9
23693,Squidward,199," Oh, listen you dumb-- [Squidward stops talking, and realizes that SpongeBob and Patrick moving out is a positive thing. He imagines himself in front of his house, forming a rainbow that destroys SpongeBob and Patrick's homes. After this, he makes a creepy smile] Uh, you know, looks like you guys got Fishkinned, and well, there's nothing you can do about that! [chuckles]
",9
23694,SpongeBob,199," Ready for work, Mr. Krabs!
",9
23695,Mr. Krabs,199," [sees SpongeBob looking like a wreck] Wait a minute! What's the matter with you, boy? [view shows SpongeBob looking like a wreck] You like you slept in a pile of trash!
",9
23696,SpongeBob,199," A pile-of-trash house! Patrick and I built one out back with all your garbage!
",9
23697,Mr. Krabs,199," With my garbage? On my land?! I'll be chargin' ye a reasonable rental fee.
",9
23698,SpongeBob,199," [shocked] How much?
",9
23699,Mr. Krabs,199," Hmm...your paycheck oughtta cover it!
",9
23700,SpongeBob,199," Gee, I didn't know being homeless was so expensive.
",9
23701,Squidward,199," [checking his watch] Ah, work is done! [puts his hat in his pocket] Now I can go home to a SpongeBob-free zone and rearrange my doily collection!
",9
23702,SpongeBob,199," [runs up to Squidward] I miss the old neighborhood! I think I'm gonna visit my old house tonight!
",9
23703,Squidward,199," Uh, no, no, you don't wanna do that!
",9
23704,SpongeBob,199," Why?
",9
23705,Squidward,199," Well, a family has moved in there, with a lot of kids, and they don't like to be disturbed.
",9
23706,SpongeBob,199," How many's a lot?
",9
23707,Squidward,199," Oh, like, pfft, 12 kids!
",9
23708,SpongeBob,199," But if I just ask politely to visit do you think they--
",9
23709,Squidward,199," And they don't speak English! Uh, the Fishtraps only speak...German!
",9
23710,Patrick,199," [on a table eating garbage] Maybe I can move in with whoever's in my house.
",9
23711,Squidward,199," No no no, uh, a band lives there now!
",9
23712,Patrick,199," A rock band?
",9
23713,Squidward,199," Um, yes.
",9
23714,Patrick,199," Cause my house is a rock?
",9
23715,Squidward,199," Yes, a big rock band with like eight people and all sorts of musical equipment so there's only room for musicians! [he leaves the Krusty Krab]
",9
23716,SpongeBob,199," Hey, I could learn German!
",9
23717,Patrick,199," And I could learn what ""learn"" is.
",9
23718,Squidward,199," Mmmm, nice! Ah, it's like a beautiful dream! So peaceful, no more aggravation! [he hears someone knocking on SpongeBob's pineapple. He looks outside and sees SpongeBob] What is that porous terror up to now? Oh no, he's expecting a big family that speaks German! [Squidward runs into his closet, grabs supplies, and runs to SpongeBob's house. He open's SpongeBob's door, dressed in a Tyrolean hat and lederhosen] Uh, German hallo?
",9
23719,SpongeBob,199," Ack! Guten morgan! My name is SpongeBob! (Ach! Guten morgen! Mein Name ist SpongeBob!)
",9
23720,Squidward,199," Say what?

23721,SpongeBob,199," Guten morgan! My name is SpongeBob! I came here to visit my old home. (Guten morgen! Mein Name ist SpongeBob! Ich bin gekommen um mein altes Heimat zu besuchen.)

23724,Squidward,199," Umm...Gerhard.

23725,SpongeBob,199," Well, hello, Gerhard, I used to live here. Just stopped by to visit my old home.
",9
23726,Squidward,199," Ach, meine Neptune, uh, now is nein such a good time mit the wife and zuch!
",9
23727,SpongeBob,199," [while Patrick is walking behind SpongeBob] Wife? Where is she?
",9
23728,Patrick,199," Hey, SpongeBob.

23729,Squidward,199," [panicked] She's shy...well, I must be going! Mein wifenz calling me for zupper! She is a fine Gutenchef of Fudenschlop!

23733,Squidward,199," I don't know...Hedvig! [Squidward grabs SpongeBob and puts him into his chair] Dunt movin! Not a schtepp! [SpongeBob tries to get out of chair, but Squidward rushes and stops him] Nein, nein! No moven sie! Sitz! [Squidward rushes back to his house, grabs more supplies, and rushes to Patrick's house. Patrick knocks on his rock, and Squidward open it, dressed as a rock star] Hey, man, like, what's happening?
",9
23734,Patrick,199," I missed my house, and I was hoping I could move back in.
",9
23735,Squidward,199," Oh, sorry, dude, no room. This place is, like, filled with band members and musical instruments.
",9
23736,Patrick,199," What do you play?
",9
23737,Squidward,199," Oh, pfft, the electric clarinet.
",9
23738,Patrick,199," There's no such thing!
",9
23739,Squidward,199," [a little nervous] Sure there is.
",9
23740,Patrick,199," Prove it!
",9
23741,Squidward,199," I'll be right back! [Squidward runs back to his house, grabs his clarinet, puts a speaker in it, grabs a bunch of musical equipment, then runs back to Patrick's house. The camera then zooms over to SpongeBob in his chair]

23742,SpongeBob,199," Oh, Gerhard! Are you coming back?
",9
23743,Squidward,199," [he pops up behind Patrick's rock, and sneaks back to SpongeBob's pineapple, still in his rock band outfit]
",9
23744,SpongeBob,199," Hello! [SpongeBob gets out of his chair and shakes Squidward's hand] You must be Hedvig!
",9
23745,Squidward,199," Hedvig? [now pretending to be Hedvig] Oh, oh yeah, that's me, Hedvig!
",9
23746,SpongeBob,199," I have heard so much about your kerglooginpfiefer mit schlusinberry klabber sauz! Can't wait to try it.
",9
23747,Squidward,199," One-- [in Hedvig's voice] One second! [Squidward grabs a trash can full of garbage, dumps it on a plate, and gives it to SpongeBob] Tonight's zupper is to go, so please, to go!
",9
23748,SpongeBob,199," Well aren't your twelve little German children gonna sing for me while I eat?
",9
23749,Squidward,199," I don't have children! [realizing what he said] I mean- I mean, yeah, yeah, outside please! [Squidward pushes SpongeBob outside]
",9
23750,SpongeBob,199," I love outdoor concerts.
",9
23751,Squidward,199," Uh, groovy enough for ya, man?
",9
23752,Patrick,199," That was great! You should give lessons to my ex-neighbor, Squidward! He stinks!
",9
23753,Patrick,199," What's going on?
",9
23754,SpongeBob,199," Shhh! The Fishtrap children are gonna sing!
",9
23755,Squidward,199," [with puppets on his tentacles] ♪Ve are der little kiddievinks, der kiddievinks, der kiddievinks, ve are der little kiddievinks, ve love to sing all day!♪
",9
23756,SpongeBob,199," [eating part of his ""ker gloupen veisher mit schvodenberryclabasous""] I think the littlest kiddywink is off-key.
",9
23757,Patrick,199," They need a band. I'll go talk to the guys that live in my old place, and see if they can come over to play along!
",9
23758,SpongeBob,199," Yeah!
",9
23759,Squidward,199," [frustrated by this] That's it, I'm done! [he takes off his wig and puppets]
",9
23760,SpongeBob,199," Squidward!? What are you doing in the Fishtraps' house?
",9
23761,Squidward,199," You idiots! It's not the Fishtraps' house, it's your house, and that is still Patrick's house! You just saw a commercial -- that's all!
",9
23762,Patrick,199," So...is Nick Fishkins gonna live in my house?
",9
23763,Squidward,199," [stops growling] He doesn't live in the houses he buys.
",9
23764,SpongeBob,199," Well if he doesn't live in them, what does he do with them?
",9
23765,Squidward,199," He flips the houses, you dimwits! He buys houses then resells them for a profit! He flips houses for a living!
",9
23766,Patrick,199," He flips houses for a living?
",9
23767,Squidward,199," Yes! And I'm calling Nick Fishkins right now to come over and flip my house, so I can move away! [walks away mumbling angrily]
",9
23768,SpongeBob,199," Poor Squidward. We should do something really nice for him!
",9
23769,Patrick,199," [gets an idea] I know!
",9
23770,SpongeBob,199," Alright, Patrick! On the count of three! One...two...three! [SpongeBob and Patrick literally flip over Squidward's house, while Squidward is screaming inside. His house proceeds to fall upside down. Then, Nick Fishkins pulls up]
",9
23771,Nick,199," Say, is this the home of Squidward Tentacles? The one that was for sale?
",9
23772,SpongeBob,199," Sure is!
",9
23773,Nick,199," Yeesh. This place is a wreck! I'm Nick Fishkins and I do not wanna buy this home! Not sold! [a sign saying ""NOT SOLD!"" appears in front of Nick. Nick then drives away]
",9
23774,Squidward,199," [coming out from the top of his flipped home] What happened?
",9
23775,SpongeBob,199," We flipped your house for ya.
",9
23776,Squidward,199," Who's that driving away?
",9
23777,Patrick,199," That was Nick Fishkins.
",9
23778,Squidward,199," And what did he say?
",9
23779,Patrick,199," He said ""Yeesh! Who'd wanna live in that thing? Not sold!""

",9
23818,SpongeBob,201," Oh, hey there, Shalmon. Uh, my name is SpongeBob.
",9
23819,Shalmon,201," Why do you dump your nuts on my people's land, SpongeBob?
",9
23820,SpongeBob,201," Oh, they're not mine. They're my friend, Sandy's.
",9
23821,Shalmon,201," Allow me to give you some sage advice. You must not squander nature's bounty. Nuts are meant to be eatin'. [pulls out his secrets book] It's all in my book.
",9
23822,SpongeBob,201," Meant to be eatin' eh?
",9
23823,Shalmon,201," Of course! The earth provides our food and we must care for her in return. [balances on a rock] It's all about balance, my friend. Look at my garden.
",9
23824,SpongeBob,201," Wow. It's coming in great.
",9
23825,Shalmon,201," [sighs] Over there!
",9
23826,SpongeBob,201," Even better!
",9
23827,Sandy,201," So some Shalmon guy told you people would want to eat my nuts and you believe it?
",9
23828,SpongeBob,201," Uh huh. Uh huh. Surely the Shalmon isn't a sham.
",9
23829,Sandy,201," Shertainly not! I mean certainly not! [pulls out her cookbook] Let's see what we can cook up. Aged Nut Brie. Ghost Nut Chili. How 'bout Nutty Butter? Seems easy enough to make.
",9
23830,Sandy,201," Woo-hoo! That's delicious!
",9
23831,SpongeBob,201," Wow! Patrick would wanna try this.
",9
23832,Patrick,201," [arrives at the scene] Try what?
",9
23833,Sandy,201," Patrick, that Nutty Butter is for eating.
",9
23834,Patrick,201," I know. [takes off his helmet and bites on his stomach] Ow! [sucks the butter and bites again] Ow! [sucks the butter and bites again] Ow!
",9
23835,Sandy,201," Hmm. Why don't you boys take some for the road?
",9
23836,SpongeBob and Patrick,201," Thanks!
",9
23837,Patrick,201," Can I have some more? [points to his back that is smeared by her Nutty Butter] It's hard to eat off this side of me. [tries to reach with his tongue but couldn't]
",9
23838,Sandy,201," Sure, Patrick! Here's the last of it!
",9
23839,Patrick,201," Thanks, Sandy!
",9
23840,Sandy,201," There. Everything is back to normal. [she hears noise outside her treedome] What in tarnation?
",9
23841,Patrick,201," Hey, Sandy!
",9
23842,Sandy,201," Patrick, what's going on here?
",9
23843,Patrick,201," I want more Nutty Butter.
",9
23844,Sandy,201," Who are all these people?
",9
23845,Patrick,201," Oh. [laughs] They licked the Nutty Butter off my back. [Patrick's back is all clean but there is one particle of Nutty Butter leftover. Frankie Billy licks it off his back.] And now they're here for more.
",9
23846,Sandy,201," Aw, gosh Patrick. I don't have enough to feed everyone.
",9
23847,Abigail Marge,201," But it's the only thing my boy will eat!
",9
23848,Archie,201," Guess I'll have to go to bed hungry again.
",9
23849,Sandy,201," Well, I don't want to let anyone down. I can make some more acorns!
",9
23850,Sandy,201," Making everyone's day with my Nutty Butter really gives me the warm and tinglies!
",9
23851,Patrick,201," Uh huh.
",9
23852,Sandy,201," In fact, demands have been so high, I scienced up a way to increase my production.
",9
23853,Sandy,201," SpongeBob, here, scoops acorns onto my conveyor belt. [SpongeBob shovels some acorns on the conveyor belt] Then the tubes take them inside [the tube sucks up the acorns and Sandy pulls the lever down on her Nutty Butter machine to put some in a jar] where I turn them into Nutty Butter.
",9
23854,SpongeBob,201," [reading the Shalmon's book] Sandy, according to the Shalmon's book, we shouldn't try to force nature to give us more than she's able.
",9
23855,Sandy,201," Don't worry about my tree, SpongeBob. Worry about the crowd of Nutty Butter fans outside.
",9
23856,Crowd,201," We want Nutty Butter! We want Nutty Butter!
",9
23857,Sandy,201," We're gonna need a lot more acorns to feed them all.
",9
23858,SpongeBob,201," Uh oh. Sandy's tree's not lookin' so good. I don't think it can take much more of this, Patrick.
",9
23859,Patrick,201," Uh. Well, it's like Sandy said, ""Something, something, something, science."" And who are we to argue with science?
",9
23860,SpongeBob,201," Oh no! The nuts stopped!
",9
23861,Patrick,201," Hold on! I got this!
",9
23862,SpongeBob,201," Oh no! Patrick, we have to do something! Sandy'll never forgive us if we ruined her tree!
",9
23863,Patrick,201," And I'll never forgive her if she runs out of Nutty Butter!
",9
23864,Sandy,201," Please, please no pushing! I'll make more! Remember, Sandy's the squirrel you can count on!
",9
23865,Sandy,201," Oh no! What in the Sam Hill is goin' on around here?
",9
23866,SpongeBob,201," The tree got real sick!
",9
23867,Patrick,201," Don't worry. I made more Nutty Butter with the rest of the nuts.
",9
23868,Sandy,201," You used all the nuts? Jumpin' Jiminy! Time for another dose of fertilizer!
",9
23869,SpongeBob,201," Sandy, wait! I don't think that's what your tree needs!
",9
23870,Shalmon,201," [appears at the top of Sandy's wilted tree] The boy is right! Why do you hurt your tree? The tree would never hurt you. [gets pricked by a splinter] Ouch! Dang splinters!
",9
23871,SpongeBob,201," Shalmon?
",9
23872,Sandy,201," Wait, you're the one who said I should feed my nuts to the people?
",9
23873,Shalmon,201," Indeed. But to feed so many from a single tree... Let me share with you a story. Long ago, before fish walked the seas, there lived in the sky one sun.
",9
23874,Sun,201," [laughs]
",9
23875,Shalmon,201," One star.
",9
23876,Star,201," Hello!
",9
23877,Shalmon,201," And one moon.
",9
23878,Moon,201," What the?
",9
23879,Shalmon,201," During the day, the star would play with the sun.
",9
23880,Shalmon,201," At night, the star would play with the moon.
",9
23881,Moon,201," Get away from me!
",9
23882,Shalmon,201," The star did not want to let his friends down. But he alone could not keep up with both the sun and the moon.
",9
23883,Moon,201," Finally. Some peace.
",9
23884,Shalmon,201," That is when the star had an idea.
",9
23885,Moon,201," Hmm? Hmm? Ahh! [sees multiple stars] Oh no. There goes the neighborhood.
",9
23886,Shalmon,201," By creating many copies, the star was able to keep the sun and moon happy without wearing himself out. Do you understand why I tell you this tale?
",9
23887,Shalmon,201," Hello? Wake up!
",9
23888,Patrick,201," [angry] I didn't know there was gonna be a test!
",9
23889,Sandy,201," Oh, I got so wrapped up in not letting anyone down that I asked too much of my tree and my friends.
",9
23890,Shalmon,201," Perhaps with many trees, you can continue serving your community in a natural and sustainable manner. [thinks for a second] I mean pretty much anything is better than this mess! Yeesh!
",9
23891,Sandy,201," Thanks, Shammy. But I'm a one tree kind of squirrel. I'm gonna do what I should've done in the first place. Order the ole' girl some nutritious new dirt from Texas!
",9
23892,Shalmon,201," Well, my work here is done. It's time I return to my people.
",9
23893,Shalmon,201," Let me offer some sage advice. You must listen to the earth and the stars, for only they can guide you!... To my stop at the corner of Olive and Victory.
",9
23894,Nat Peterson,201," Sir, stand behind the white line please.
",9
23895,Shalmon,201," Typical. It never ends!

",9
23964,Patrick,202," 100%.
",9
23965,Squidward,202," Mr. Krabs, we've got to stop for the night if you want SpongeBob and Patrick to live! I'm not saying that's what I want, I'm just telling you the facts.
",9
23966,SpongeBob,202," We must guard this last patty with our very lives! It's the only way to win Food Con! And who knows what scary, hungry things are out there in the woods waiting to gobble it up!
",9
23967,SpongeBob,202," Positions everyone!
",9
23968,SpongeBob,202," Aww. Hey, little fella.
",9
23969,Everyone,202," The patty!
",9
23970,SpongeBob,202," Oh, what are we gonna do?!
",9
23971,Mr. Krabs,202," Don't eat my patty!
",9
23972,SpongeBob,202," Squidward, you've saved the Krabby Patty!
",9
23973,Squidward,202," Whoopee.
",9
23974,Mr. Krabs,202," Maybe I could just eat a pickle.
",9
23975,Squidward,202," Maybe I could just eat the corner of the lettuce.
",9
23976,Patrick,202," I don't wanna be a hog. I'll just eat what's leftover.
",9
23977,SpongeBob,202," No, we can't do that! I know we're all hungry, but we must stay focused! Remember Food Con! Remember the cornucopia!
",9
23978,Mr. Krabs,202," [whispers to Squidward] He says ""Food Con"". But all I hear is ""food"".
",9
23979,Patrick,202," Hey, SpongeBob. You look tired. You want me to guard the patty for a bit?
",9
23980,SpongeBob,202," [yawns] Thanks, Patrick. That'll be great.
",9
23981,SpongeBob,202," Patrick, no!
",9
23982,Patrick,202," I can't believe you thought I would eat it!
",9
23983,SpongeBob,202," Patrick, I'm sorry I doubted you. I'm just hungry and tired and I feel like I'm all alone doing the right thing and I...
",9
23984,SpongeBob,202," Hey!
",9
23985,Patrick,202," But I'm hungry!
",9
23986,Patrick,202," Ow! [laughs nervously]
",9
23987,Squidward,202," I'll lure him to sleep with a lovely lullaby.
",9
23988,Mr. Krabs,202," Ooh, good idea. Music soothes the savage beast.
",9
23989,Squidward,202," What the? [screams]
",9
23990,Mr. Krabs,202," Did I say ""soothe""? I guess I meant enrages.
",9
23991,Squidward,202," Everybody's a critic.
",9
23992,Mr. Krabs,202," Hey there, boy-oh! I've taken the liberty of creatin' a safe to secure our precious patty.
",9
23993,SpongeBob,202," Great idea, Mr. Krabs!
",9
23994,Mr. Krabs,202," [opens his safe] Just put in right in here. I'll even step away while you do it.
",9
23995,SpongeBob,202," Pew, it smells really bad in there.
",9
23996,Mr. Krabs,202," Ok, just do it already!
",9
23997,SpongeBob,202," No!
",9
23998,Mr. Krabs,202," Enough of this! I am your boss and I order you to give me that patty!
",9
23999,SpongeBob,202," No, Mr. Krabs! I will not! But I will give you these.
",9
24000,SpongeBob,202," Nature Patties!
",9
24001,Patrick,202," Oh boy!
",9
24002,Squidward,202," How delightful!
",9
24003,Mr. Krabs,202," Dig in, boys!
",9
24004,Squidward,202," Oh! It's like eating the inside of a lawn mower!
",9
24005,Mr. Krabs,202," I think mine is mostly stones!
",9
24006,SpongeBob,202," [swings above them] Out here, we call them forest tomatoes.
",9
24007,Mr. Krabs,202," Enough of this! [tries to grab the patty but is halted by SpongeBob]
",9
24008,SpongeBob,202," Mr. Krabs, remember Food Con!
",9
24009,Mr. Krabs,202," You can't win Food Con if you starve to death! Now, give me that Krabby Patty boy-oh!
",9
24010,SpongeBob,202," No! I'm doing this for your own good! I'm protecting you all from yourselves!
",9
24011,Mr. Krabs,202," Well, in that case, you leave me no choice. Get him!!!
",9
24012,SpongeBob,202," Yeow!!
",9
24013,Patrick,202," Hunger!
",9
24014,Krabby Patty,202," Hey! Psst! It's me! The patty!
",9
24015,SpongeBob,202," Oh, hi.
",9
24016,Krabby Patty,202," It's just me and you out here, now. So, just do it. Eat me.
",9
24017,SpongeBob,202," What about Food Con?
",9
24018,Krabby Patty,202," [floats above SpongeBob] Oh, forget Food Con. You're starving and I'm right here. [licks SpongeBob]
",9
24019,SpongeBob,202," Maybe you're right.
",9
24020,Krabby Patty,202," Of course, I'm right. I'm a talking sandwich.
",9
24021,SpongeBob,202," [grabs the patty] Yes, a sandwich has no reason to lie.
",9
24022,SpongeBob,202," [gasps] No! I made a vow! I will not eat you!
",9
24023,Mr. Krabs,202," [offscreen] Shh! Shh! I hear him over there! He's arguing with the patty! Get him!
",9
24024,Mr. Krabs,202," Don't let him get away!
",9
24025,SpongeBob,202," What? [gasps] Food Con!
",9
24026,Mr. Krabs,202," Get him!

",9
24036,Mayor,202," The winner is... the Krabby Patty!

",9
24074,Mr. Krabs,203," Pisha! He'll think it's still here! His tiny brain is incapable of the kind of abstract thinking that is required for reflection. Or thoughtful reasoning and deduction. He cannot ruminate.

24098,Plankton,203," Hello, sir... [clears throat and talks in a higher voice] Hello, sir! I'm selling Sweetie Patrol cookies! We have a lovely assortment of fungi and algae flavors.
",9
24099,Plankton,203," How many delicious boxes can I put you down for? If you order ten boxes, I'll qualify for my bottom-dweller badge. If you order a hundred boxes, I'll get my bling-bling badge. You know, you should hide these from your roommate. She'll eat all of them. [regular voice] If you show me your best hiding place, I'd be happy to help.

24102,Gary,203," Meow?
",9
24103,Plankton,203," I forgot how much I hate pineapple.
",9
24104,Plankton,203," [munches on the snail litter] Hey, this snail litter tastes better than pineapple. [swallows] Now, where is that secret formula?
",9
24105,Plankton,203," Where is it? Where is it? Gotta be here somewhere.
",9
24106,Plankton,203," Nothin' in there. [sees one of the hooks on SpongeBob's decoration] Ooh, look at that.
",9
24107,Plankton,203," Hello!
",9
24108,Plankton,203," Where the barnacles is it?
",9
24109,Plankton,203," Where is it? Where is it? I know you're in here! You're not foolin' anybody! I went to college!
",9
24110,Plankton,203," Nope, nope, nope.
",9
24111,Plankton,203," Alright, Snail! Let's go! Just you and me!
",9
24112,Gary,203," Meow!
",9
24113,Plankton,203," Put 'em up! Put 'em up!
",9
24114,Plankton,203," Of course! What a fool I've been!
",9
24115,Plankton,203," SpongeBob's hidden the secret formula inside Gary's shell! Sheesh! This place is disgusting! I bet it reeks. Good thing I don't have a nose. Huh? [turns around and sees Gary's eye following him] Aye yae yae!
",9
24116,SpongeBob,203," Gary, I'm home!
",9
24117,SpongeBob,203," What happened here? [gasps] My first Krabby Patty! I had it bronzed! Oh, and I was gonna give that to my grandchildren! [gasps] My Mermaid Man collectible underpants! Oh, I could've worn them a thousand more times! [gasps] My glass of water! [teary] I was gonna drink that! Oh, the Krabby Patty formula!
",9
24118,SpongeBob,203," Whew! It's safe and right where I left it.
",9
24119,SpongeBob,203," Gary, did you do this?
",9
24120,Gary,203," [growls]
",9
24121,SpongeBob,203," What's the matter, Gary? Something wrong with your shell?
",9

24123,SpongeBob,203," Something's not right, Gary.
",9
24124,SpongeBob,203," I'd better get you to the vet.

24125,Gary,203," Meow.
",9
24126,Plankton,203," Ha! I lost him! Now, I'm lost!
",9
24127,Plankton,203," Ah, my head. Oh, I must be in the center of the shell. [he sees a piece of paper stuck in the slime] What's that? [opens it] This is it! Just like I thought! It was hidden here all the time! The secret Krabby Patty formula! It's beautiful!
",9
24128,Plankton,203," The heavenly light! I always knew I'd see it once I've gotten the formula! Let me bask in its glory! [sighs]
",9
24129,Doctor,203," Well, that's odd. Who's that?
",9
24130,SpongeBob,203," Hey, it's Plankton.
",9
24131,Doctor,203," What's he got there?
",9
24132,SpongeBob,203," Looks like one of my old grocery lists.
",9
24133,Doctor,203," I don't know how he got in there, but the gases inside this shell are making the little guy hallucinate. He would've smelled the gases if he had a nose like most good-hearted people. [sniffs]
",9
24134,Plankton,203," Ha, ha! I got it! I got it!
",9
24135,Plankton,203," I've finally got the formula! It's mine, it's mine, it's mine, it's mine! Open the sparkling apple juice, Karen! Daddy's bringing the bacon home! Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Whoo!",9

",9
24196,Customers,204," Yeah!
",9

",9
24199,Customer 1,204," We'll never get out!
",9

",9
24201,Octavius Rex,204," We're alive! Captain Squidward steered us out of the rip current!

24202,Customer 1,204," How about a cheer for Captain Squidward!
",9
24203,Squidward,204," Thank you! Thank you! Just doin' my job as captain protecting my crew.

",9
24208,Buddy,204," Hey, good idea! I could go for a Krabby Patty.

",9
24216,SpongeBob,204," Uh, Captain, sorry to interrupt, but the crew needs you to protect them.
",9
24217,Squidward,204," Are you crazy? I can't fight a monster!
",9
24218,SpongeBob,204," Oh, I'm afraid the crew insists, sir.
",9
24219,Squidward,204," I don't want to be captain! I don't want to be captain!
",9
24220,Octavius Rex,204," Well, that was anti-climatic.
",9
24221,Customer 1,204," Maybe he'll make the monster sick.
",9
24222,Clay,204," Okay. Who had their money on Captain Squidward? Pay up.
",9
24223,SpongeBob,204," Well, somebody has to step up, fight that monster, and become captain! And that somebody is me!
",9
24224,SpongeBob,204," Oh, what was I doing now?
",9
24225,SpongeBob,204," Mr. Krabs, you're alive! Oh, welcome back, captain!
",9
24226,Mr. Krabs,204," Haven't you forgotten something? I am not captain anymore! Squidward is!
",9
24227,SpongeBob,204," Uh, uh. The monster ate him. We need a captain and that's you! Isn't that right?
",9
24228,Mr. Krabs,204," Why would I want to be captain to such a sorry bunch of lubbers? I'm through!
",9
24229,Mr. Krabs,204," And that's comin' out of your pay!
",9
24230,SpongeBob,204," Mr. Krabs, this job calls for a dictator like you!
",9
24231,SpongeBob,204," Do something, Mr. Krabs!
",9
24232,Mr. Krabs,204," Beg me.
",9
24233,Customers,204," Please, please, please!

24236,Customers,204," Oh, come on! We'll do anything! Please!
",9
24237,SpongeBob,204," Got it! [runs back] Do you know what this is, Mr. Krabs?
",9
24238,Mr. Krabs,204," I don't care.
",9
24239,SpongeBob,204," It's the first dime you ever earned and I'm going to tear it up if you don't go back to being the meanie we need!
",9
24240,Mr. Krabs,204," I said I don't care.
",9
24241,SpongeBob,204," Okay, here goes!

24242,Unnamed man,204," My leg!

24243,Mr. Krabs,204," Ha! You lose!

",9
24258,Mr. Krabs,204," [hands SpongeBob his dime] Hold on to me dime, boy-yo.
",9
24259,Octavius Rex,204," Well, that was anti-climatic.

24360,Sandy,205," Dang. You two sure are lucky that I created this brain detector last summer. I was beginning to think I'd never use this thing.
",10
24361,SpongeBob,205," Oh, I hope we find our brains soon. They're probably cold and hungry by now. Poor things.
",10
24362,Sandy,205," And it looks like you're not the only critters around these parks to lose your minds. [looks at her detector] Hmm... And my detector is leading us directly to that house.
",10
24363,Sandy,205," Excuse me, kind sir. Would you mind too terribly if we just came in your house for a minute and looked around for my friend's missin' brains?
",10
24364,Sandy,205," We're gonna take that as a yes. Step lively, fellas!
",10
24365,Sandy,205," This place has a ten-gallon case of the creepies. I wonder what's in...

",10
24369,"SpongeBob, Sandy and Patrick",205," Huh?
",10
24370,Angry Old Timer,205," What are you sneak thieves doing into my house? Them brains violated my air space and I'm keepin' them! I'm callin' the cops!
",10
24371,Sandy,205," Sorry nothin'! Look, Old Timer, one false move and I'll be on you like a horsefly on a cracker barrel!
",10
24372,Angry Old Timer,205," Bring it on, Slimmy Whiskers! All twenty-threes can do your bees knees with one nickel, sister!
",10
24373,Sandy,205," Alright! Now you listen to me, you twisted coot! You can't steal somebody's brain just because it flies into your yard! That's brain-napping! And it looks like I'll be the one callin' the police!
",10
24374,SpongeBob,205," Oh, I love it when Sandy gets aggressive. Let's give her some room.
",10
24375,Fred,205," Oh, Brainy, you're back!
",10
24376,SpongeBob,205," Whew! I'll never be a no-brainer again! [laughs]
",10
24377,Sandy,205," Everyone has their brains back, so I'm a let it go this time. But if you steal as much as a beach ball, so help me I'll...
",10
24378,Angry Old Timer,205," [cries] I'm sorry, Squirrel Lady! I just couldn't take watching all the kids have fun in the air while I'm stuck here with this crotchety cane on the ground!
",10
24379,SpongeBob and Sandy,205," Aww!
",10
24380,Sandy,205," Well, I think we've got a cure for what ails you. Right, SpongeBob?
",10
24381,SpongeBob,205," Sandy, are you thinking what I'm thinking?
",10
24382,Sandy,205," I think I'm thinkin' what you're thinkin'.

",10
24386,SpongeBob,205," Oh, no need to thank us, Sandy. If we can just make one angry old man happy, that and itself is thanks enough. The dignity of the elderly was the victor here today.
",10

24832,Mr. Krabs,210," What goes on, boyos?
",10
24833,SpongeBob,210," Squidward is gonna try out The Sushi Maker.
",10
24834,Mr. Krabs,210," Why does he want to do that?
",10
24835,SpongeBob,210," Oh, don't worry, Mr. Krabs. He's got life insurance. He can't be hurt.
",10
24836,Mr. Krabs,210," That's not how life insurance works.
",10
24837,Patrick,210," It's not?
",10
24838,Mr. Krabs,210," Course not! [shows chalkboard that demonstrates life insurance] Life insurance is money the beneficiary gets when a person dies. By the way, who gets the money?
",10
24839,SpongeBob,210," Well, let's see. [swipes the life insurance from Squidward's pocket] No name here.
",10
24840,Mr. Krabs,210," Hooray! [takes out pen and signs the contract] Eugene H. Krabs. Go, Squidward! [switches to cheerleading outfit] Yay! Fly high! Do or die! Preferably the latter. [chuckles]
",10
24841,SpongeBob,210," D-d-d-d-do or die?! Squidward, come down! You're not invincible! Life insurance is not what you think! You were right! Oh, it was just dumb luck!
",10
24842,Patrick,210," Now I'm yelling too!
",10
24843,Squidward,210," Oh, what are those ninnies going on about now? I can't hear you! Just shut up and watch me! [puts on toupee just as SpongeBob and Patrick shake the latter] Nah—hey!
",10
24844,SpongeBob,210," Come back, Squidward! Don't do this!
",10
24845,Squidward,210," Will you stop shaking it?
",10
24846,Squidward,210," No, no, no, no, no!
",10
24847,Squidward,210," Ow...
",10
24848,SpongeBob,210," Hey, Squidward, guess what I learned today. Apparently, a life insurance policy doesn't protect a person from injury. Heh, how about that?
",10
24849,Squidward,210," Ha, how 'bout that? [spits out a tooth]
",10
24850,SpongeBob,210," Squidward, how did you survive The Sushi Maker?
",10
24851,Squidward,210," [takes off his toupee] It had to be this.
",10
24852,SpongeBob,210," Ah!

24861,Plankton,211," Whoa, big fella!
",10
24862,Perch Perkins,211," Mr. Plankton, we've received a word that you're plotting to infiltrate the Krusty Krab and steal the Krabby Patty secret formula. [shoves Plankton a microphone to speak to] Is that true?
",10
24863,Plankton,211," [thinks for a while] Actually, yes, that is true. I've got it all worked out. [shows point-of-view of the cameraman] First I break into the safe, and... [looks back] Huh? Wait, is this live?
",10
24864,Perch Perkins,211," Yes!
",10
24865,Plankton,211," Don't broadcast my secret plans! They're secret! [cameraman appears again. Plankton slams his head onto the camera screen.] I will destroy all of you! [cameraman's camera cuts]

24866,Plankton,211," Secret formula, ho! [whips Robot Seahorse and it races to the Krusty Krab.]
",10
24867,Plankton,211," [Texas accent] I reckon that classified taste mixture will be in my hands directly. [spits into a golden pot]
",10
24868,Plankton,211," [spits] Ow! [shakes his head quickly. Stares through the Krusty Krab door to see Mr. Krabs' office with an open vault and exposed Krabby Patty Secret Formula. Laughs evilly] The fool! He left the safe open! [presses a button to make his rocket missile appear. It blasts off randomly, but soon moves straight toward the Krusty Krab.]
",10
24869,Plankton,211," Open for business, baby! [zooms past the customers in the Krusty Krab, then crashes into a paper drawing of the vault.]
",10
24870,Mr. Krabs,211," [cheeky laugh. Jumps out of his desk, tears off paper] Gotcha! [rolls paper into a scroll]

24871,Plankton,211," Urrgh!

24886,Mr. Krabs,211," [appears in the customer's stomach as well] Gotcha. [laughs]
",10
24887,Plankton,211," Oh, Karen, he covered me in urchins, fed me to a seahorse, and stung me to death! I fly through the air, he flies through the air! I hide in a stomach, he hides in a stomach! I have had enough!
",10
24888,Karen,211," Oh, I think someone needs their ba-ba. [feeds Plankton a bottle of milk] There, isn't that better?

",10
24896,Mr. Krabs,211," That'll be the day! I don't trust Plankton as far as I throw him! That's why we're gonna shadow that little twit and find out what he's up to!

24898,SpongeBob,211," ""Welcome to Dullsville, a charmingly boring...""

24899,Mr. Krabs,211," [shuts SpongeBob's mouth] Snap your trap, boy-o! You'll blow our cover!
",10
24900,Plankton,211," A new life in a new town! [laughs evilly]
",10
24901,SpongeBob,211," I still don't see Plankton doing anything wrong. Maybe he really is retiring.
",10
24902,Mr. Krabs,211," Believes it when I sees it.

24903,Mr. Krabs,211," Quick, boy, he's getting away!

24904,Clerk,211," Yes?
",10
24905,Plankton,211," I'd like a room, please.

24906,Clerk,211," Very good, sir. [grabs Plankton and writes down on clipboard, thinking he's a pen] How long will you be staying with us?
",10
24907,Plankton,211," Forever. [gets squished by an old man's walker]
",10
24908,Plankton,211," And so begins my retirement! [laughs manically]
",10
24909,Mr. Krabs,211," You see there, lad? Plankton is up to no good! I bet those are all the fixings for another evil lab.
",10
24910,SpongeBob,211," [his skin turns green] Mr. Krabs, I'm gonna be sick.
",10
24911,Plankton,211," [laughs as he unpacks his boxes] Yes! [puts on belt] Yes! [laughs]
",10
24912,Mr. Krabs,211," You see? He's got an evil belt to match those evil shoes!
",10
24913,Plankton,211," Yes! My plan is almost complete! [laughs manically]
",10
24914,Mr. Krabs,211," His plan! [shakes SpongeBob] Did you hear that, SpongeBob? He said, ""plan!""
",10
24915,SpongeBob,211," Uh, please don't shake me, Mr. Krabs.
",10
24916,Plankton,211," Oh, my pretty. You'll be my best friend from now on. [laughs] Retirement is mine! Mine! Mine! [laughs manically]
",10
24917,Mr. Krabs,211," Ooh, this is it, boy-o. He's got an evil laser death apparatus contraption ready to spring on all of us!
",10
24918,Mr. Krabs,211," Ooh.
",10
24919,Mr. Krabs,211," Now that I sees it, I believes it.
",10
24920,SpongeBob,211," Hurray! I knew you'd get it, Mr. [gets sick] Krabs! [runs into the bathroom and throws up]
",10
24921,Plankton,211," Krabs?! What are you doing in my hotel room?!
",10
24922,Mr. Krabs,211," [stammers] Oh. [shakes hands with Plankton] Good luck on your retirement, Plankton. I won't give you any more trouble.
",10
24923,Plankton,211," Oh, I know you won't, Krabs, because I'm at the Krusty Krab right now stealing that formula.
",10
24924,Mr. Krabs,211," Oh-oh, sure. Whatever you say, old-timer. How would you be doing that when you're all the way over here in Dullsville, hmm?
",10
24925,Plankton,211," [laughs] Because I'm a decoy look-alike robot!
",10
24926,Robot Plankton,211," Gotcha! [laughs]
",10
24927,SpongeBob,211," [sighs] So what'd I miss?
",10
24928,Both,211," What?!
",10
24929,Plankton,211," [through walkie-talkie] That's right, Karen. By the time those two knuckleheads figure it out, I'll be knee-deep in secret formula. [laughs] Yes, I'll wear my galoshes. Gotta go.
",10
24930,Plankton,211," In your face, Krabs! Ha!
",10
24931,Plankton,211," Krabs? SpongeBoob? W-w-why aren't you in Dullsville?
",10
24932,Mr. Krabs,211," We never left, Sheldon. The Mr. Krabs and SpongeBoob who followed the robot you to Dullsville were also robots. Gotcha! [laughs]
",10
24933,Plankton,211," [grumbles] Hate! Hate! [bangs his head against the floor] Hate! Hate! Hate! Hate! Hate!
",10
24934,Robot SpongeBob,211," So the way I see it, Mr. Krabs and Plankton are just using us as pawns in their dumb secret formula war.
",10
24935,Robot Plankton,211," Agreed.
",10
24936,Robot Mr. Krabs,211," Yeah, I mean, who cares if that guy steals the secret formula anyway? Grow up, that's what I say.
",10
24937,Robot Plankton,211," Agreed.
",10
24938,Plankton,211," So you're the real Krabs and SpongeBob. [grabs formula] Gimme that! [runs off]
",10
24939,Both,211," Ooh. [yells]
",10
24940,SpongeBob,211," [answers the phone] Hello? Krusty Krab, make I take your order? No, Mr. Krabs is unable to come to the phone right now. He's trapped under a dust cloud brawl. Yeah, he'll have to call you back. [hangs up the phone] Gee, I hope our robot look-alikes are okay. Bless their heart-like pneumatic pumps.
