416,Stan,2,Smog? There's never been smog over South Park before.,10,Southpark,53,9,,,,,,,,,
418,Stan,2,Smug?,10,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
433,Kyle,2,So... what do you do for fun?,10,Southpark,29,7,,,,,,,,,
436,Kyle,2,"Oh, no thanks. We don't do that stuff.",10,Southpark,38,8,,,,,,,,,
440,Kyle,2,"Yeah, fine, Dad.",10,Southpark,16,3,,,,,,,,,
442,Kyle,2,Well... maybe I'll take just half a hit of acid.,10,Southpark,48,10,,,,,,,,,
444,Stan,2,"No, no, I'm asking if there's a listing for Broflovski in San Francisco! They just moved there!",10,Southpark,95,17,,,,,,,,,
445,Cartman,2,"Haha! Take that, Jew boy! I guess you Heebs can't even play video football!",10,Southpark,75,14,,,,,,,,,
446,Butters,2,Yeah. You're right. ,10,Southpark,20,3,,,,,,,,,
447,Cartman,2,"You know Butters, you make for a lousy Jew.",10,Southpark,43,9,,,,,,,,,

452,Cartman,2,Who?,10,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
455,Cartman,2,The smug?,10,Southpark,9,2,,,,,,,,,
457,Stan,2,What is that?,10,Southpark,13,3,,,,,,,,,
459,Stan,2,George Clooney's acceptance speech?,10,Southpark,35,4,,,,,,,,,
462,Stan,2,What about San Francisco?,10,Southpark,25,4,,,,,,,,,
465,Randy,2,Are you trying to tell us the smug from our hybrids is actually gonna kill us all?,10,Southpark,82,17,,,,,,,,,
468,Randy,2,"Yeah. Good going, stupid!",10,Southpark,25,4,,,,,,,,,
472,Randy,2,"Hey, where do you think YOU're going?!",10,Southpark,38,7,,,,,,,,,
473,Stan,2,I'm gonna try and warn Kyle to get out of San Francisco.,10,Southpark,56,12,,,,,,,,,
474,Randy,2,Oh no you're not! Your gay little song got us to drive hybrids; you're gonna help us get rid of 'em!,10,Southpark,100,21,,,,,,,,,
478,Butters,2,"Wow, Eric. You sure are a great guy for doing this.",10,Southpark,51,11,,,,,,,,,
479,Cartman,2,I don't have a choice. Somebody has to get into San Francisco and warn Kyle's family to get out before the storm hits.,10,Southpark,118,23,,,,,,,,,
480,Butters,2,But... how come we can't just take the bus on into the city?,10,Southpark,60,13,,,,,,,,,
481,Cartman,2,"You don't know San Francisco, Butters.  It was the breeding ground for the hippie movement in the 60s. Those hard-core liberals, lesbian activists, and die hard modern hippies young and old.  I swore I would never set foot in San Francisco. God help me.  All right, Butters, I'll be tethered to you through this cord. It's my only lifeline, so make sure it stays taut. If you stop hearing my voice, for the love of Christ, start reeling me in with all your strength.",10,Southpark,466,84,,,,,,,,,
482,Butters,2,"I will. You're really great for going to warn Kyle, Eric.",10,Southpark,57,11,,,,,,,,,
483,Cartman,2,"I'm not doin' it for Kyle.  I can't believe I'm actually going to walk through San Francisco. Well, here it goes. ",10,Southpark,114,21,,,,,,,,,
485,Stan,2,Can't somebody else operate this? I can't really reach.,10,Southpark,55,9,,,,,,,,,
489,Cartman,2,"Butters, are you there?!",10,Southpark,24,4,,,,,,,,,
490,Butters,2,"I'm here, Eric.",10,Southpark,15,3,,,,,,,,,
491,Cartman,2,I've started to enter the smug. I'm about a quarter mile in. Can you give me an EL?,10,Southpark,83,18,,,,,,,,,
492,Butters,2,You must be nearing Union Square. Did you see a fountain to your left?,10,Southpark,70,14,,,,,,,,,
493,Cartman,2,Yes. It's just beyond yet another wine and cheese store.,10,Southpark,56,10,,,,,,,,,

500,Butters,2,"That's it! Eric, hurry! Somethin's goin' on out here!",10,Southpark,53,9,,,,,,,,,
501,Cartman,2,"Mr. Broflovski! Mr. Broflovski, there a smug storm! We have to go!",10,Southpark,66,12,,,,,,,,,
503,Cartman,2,Oh my CHRIST!  Kyle? Kyle!,10,Southpark,26,5,,,,,,,,,
504,Kyle,2,"The acid. Dude, I'm totally tripping balls.",10,Southpark,43,7,,,,,,,,,
506,Cartman,2,We have to get out of here! Now!  Kyle! Kyle!! ,10,Southpark,47,10,,,,,,,,,
508,Stan,2,No...,10,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
509,Randy,2,"I'm sorry, Stan. I'm sorry your gay little song killed your friend.",10,Southpark,67,12,,,,,,,,,
511,Stan,2,What?,10,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
513,Stan,2,Kyle!,10,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
514,Kyle,2,Hey Stan.,10,Southpark,9,2,,,,,,,,,
515,Stan,2,"Dude, what happened?? ",10,Southpark,22,3,,,,,,,,,
518,Stan,2,"Dude, I'm so glad you're not dead.",10,Southpark,34,7,,,,,,,,,
520,Randy,2,"Yeah. First off, we're all gonna need new cars.",10,Southpark,47,9,,,,,,,,,
522,Kyle,2,NO! Hybrid cars are a good thing!,10,Southpark,33,7,,,,,,,,,
524,Kyle,2,"Hybrid cars don't cause smugness, people do.  Look, hybrid cars are important. They may even save our planet one day. What you all need to do is just learn to drive hybrids and not be smug about it.",10,Southpark,198,38,,,,,,,,,
525,Randy,2,You mean... drive in hybrids... but not act like we're better than everyone else because of it.,10,Southpark,95,17,,,,,,,,,
526,Kyle,2,Yeah!,10,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
527,Randy,2,I'm...  I'm not ready...,10,Southpark,24,4,,,,,,,,,
530,Randy,2,"Perhaps... one day... we can learn to drive hybrids without being smug about it, but for now... the technology is just too much for us.",10,Southpark,135,25,,,,,,,,,
532,Cartman,2,"Well, looks like you're back for good, huh Kyle?",10,Southpark,48,9,,,,,,,,,
533,Kyle,2,"Yeah, I guess so.",10,Southpark,17,4,,,,,,,,,
534,Cartman,2,"We just can't get rid of you, can we, you sneaky Jew rat!",10,Southpark,57,13,,,,,,,,,
535,Kyle,2,"Don't belittle my people, you fucking fatass! ",10,Southpark,46,7,,,,,,,,,

543,Randy,3,"Unh, come on! ",10,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,
546,Stan,3,Kyle! What the hell is going on this time?!,10,Southpark,43,9,,,,,,,,,
547,Kyle,3,I have no idea!,10,Southpark,15,4,,,,,,,,,
552,Stan,3,"Dad?  Dad, what the hell is going on?! ",10,Southpark,39,8,,,,,,,,,
553,Randy,3,A cartoon...! A cartoon is about to air on American television with... with the Muslim prophet Mohammad as a character! ,10,Southpark,120,20,,,,,,,,,
554,Stan,3,Sso?,10,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
555,Randy,3,"SO?! Stanley, Mohammad is sacred to the Muslim people.  Ever since those cartoon in Denmark, the rules have changed. Nobody shows an image of Mohammad anymore.",10,Southpark,159,26,,,,,,,,,
557,Randy,3,Who do you think?! The cartoon that's always pushing buttons with their careless toilet humor! Family Guy!,10,Southpark,106,17,,,,,,,,,
561,Randy,3,Because Family Guy doesn't care who they insult! They only care about their... precious money!,10,Southpark,94,15,,,,,,,,,
562,Stan,3,"Oh come on, people. You really think anybody's gonna be that pissed off about a cartoon??",10,Southpark,89,16,,,,,,,,,
569,Randy,3,"We stay here through the night, wait it out to see if they do anything. If we're still alive in the morning,  then we'll know we're not dead.",10,Southpark,141,28,,,,,,,,,
571,Randy,3,We're alive?? We're alive! ,10,Southpark,27,4,,,,,,,,,
574,Randy,3,"Well, it looks like we've dodged a bullet.",10,Southpark,42,8,,,,,,,,,
575,Stan,3,They censored the image of Mohammad? How?,10,Southpark,41,7,,,,,,,,,
576,Kyle,3,I TIVO every episode. We can go to my house and see what they did.,10,Southpark,66,15,,,,,,,,,
577,Kyle,3,"Okay you guys, check it out. ",10,Southpark,29,6,,,,,,,,,
578,Cartman,3,You TIVO every episode of Family Guy?,10,Southpark,37,7,,,,,,,,,
579,Kyle,3,"Dude, it's a good show.",10,Southpark,23,5,,,,,,,,,
580,Stan,3,"Yeah, lots of people like Family Guy.",10,Southpark,37,7,,,,,,,,,
581,Cartman,3,Yich. ,10,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
592,Kyle,3,"Hehaha, heh.",10,Southpark,12,2,,,,,,,,,
593,Cartman,3,Yich.,10,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
600,Kyle,3,That's it? That's all they did?,10,Southpark,31,6,,,,,,,,,
601,Cartman,3,"Oh man, that's not cool! Seriously, that is not cool.",10,Southpark,53,10,,,,,,,,,
602,Stan,3,What? What's the big deal?,10,Southpark,26,5,,,,,,,,,
603,Cartman,3,"What's the big deal? You guys, they just made fun of the religion of an entire group of people.  What, you guys think that's okay?! Do you care at all about people's feelings?!",10,Southpark,176,33,,,,,,,,,
604,Kyle,3,"Since when you care about being sensitive to people's religion, Cartman?!",10,Southpark,73,11,,,,,,,,,
605,Stan,3,"Yeah, you rip on people's religion all the time!",10,Southpark,48,9,,,,,,,,,
606,Cartman,3,"That's different! I'm just a little boy! That's a cartoon! Millions of people watch it! How would you feel, Kyle, if there was a cartoon on television that made fun of Jews all the time?! Huh?!",10,Southpark,193,36,,,,,,,,,
607,Kyle,3,Uhhh...,10,Southpark,7,1,,,,,,,,,
608,Cartman,3,"I'm telling you guys, it's wrong! It's WRONG!!  It's wrong! ",10,Southpark,60,10,,,,,,,,,
612,Kyle,3,"Dad, Dad, Jesus Christ!",10,Southpark,23,4,,,,,,,,,
615,Kyle,3,"Mom, it was nothing. Mohammad just stood there and then drank some tea.",10,Southpark,71,13,,,,,,,,,
618,Kyle,3,"No, Muslims can't show an image of Mohammad.",10,Southpark,44,8,,,,,,,,,
620,Cartman,3,"Yeah, Kyle. Maybe you think this is funny, but the rest of us don't.",10,Southpark,68,14,,,,,,,,,
622,Cartman,3,"Mrs. Garrison, that is ignorant and racist! Muslims are mad because of Family Guy, not because they can't jack off! Right, Wendy?",10,Southpark,129,22,,,,,,,,,
625,Stan,3,The hell's going on now?!,10,Southpark,25,5,,,,,,,,,
628,Cartman,3,What?,10,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
632,Randy,3,FAMILY GUY!!!  I DAMN YOU TO HELL!!!,10,Southpark,36,7,,,,,,,,,
636,Cartman,3,Goddamned Family Guy! Now they're just provoking people! It's like they want a holy war!,10,Southpark,88,15,,,,,,,,,
637,Stan,3,Does this mean we don't have school all week?,10,Southpark,45,9,,,,,,,,,
638,Cartman,3,"You guys, this is serious! We have to do something!",10,Southpark,51,10,,,,,,,,,
639,Kenny,3,,10,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
640,Cartman,3,We have to go to the FOX network in L.A. We have to go and... try to get that episode pulled. You guys with me?,10,Southpark,111,25,,,,,,,,,
641,Stan,3,"Dude, we can't go anywhere. They've shut down the airports and the buses.",10,Southpark,73,13,,,,,,,,,
642,Cartman,3,Then we'll ride our Big Wheels.,10,Southpark,31,6,,,,,,,,,
643,Stan,3,To Los Angeles?,10,Southpark,15,3,,,,,,,,,
644,Cartman,3,"If that's what it takes, yes! We have to talk to the network! The Family Guy writers aren't gonna back down!",10,Southpark,108,21,,,,,,,,,
645,Kyle,3,Well good for them. They shouldn't! The writers are standing up and saying they aren't going to be intimidated!,10,Southpark,111,19,,,,,,,,,
646,Cartman,3,"Intimidated?! Is that what you think this is about, Kyle?",10,Southpark,57,10,,,,,,,,,
647,Kyle,3,"All right dude, what the hell has gotten into you?! I don't trust for one second that your sudden concern for the Muslim people is real!",10,Southpark,136,26,,,,,,,,,
648,Cartman,3,"All right, fine, Kyle. Forget the Muslim faith for a minute. People can get hurt. If ten people die because Family Guy just had to have their little joke, will you still think it's funny?  What if a hundred people died? Will it be funny then, Kyle?  I'm going to Los Angeles. I'm gonna do whatever I can to get that episode pulled before this gets out of hand. Somebody has to speak for the Muslim people. Somebody has to speak for what's right. ",10,Southpark,446,84,,,,,,,,,
650,Kyle,3,Dad? Are you sure there's time?,10,Southpark,31,6,,,,,,,,,
652,Kyle,3,No!,10,Southpark,3,1,,,,,,,,,
656,Kyle,3,Ike? Iiike!  Ike! ,10,Southpark,18,3,,,,,,,,,
658,Kyle,3,Ike!  This way!  Iiike! ,10,Southpark,24,4,,,,,,,,,
660,Kyle,3,Nooooo! ,10,Southpark,8,1,,,,,,,,,
661,Cartman,3,Come to try and stop me?!  It isn't gonna work. ,10,Southpark,48,10,,,,,,,,,
662,Kyle,3,"I didn't come to stop you. I... I think you're right, Cartman. I want to help you get the Family Guy episode pulled.",10,Southpark,116,23,,,,,,,,,
663,Cartman,3,"Yeah well, I don't need a partner on this.  Especially one who doesn't trust me. ",10,Southpark,81,15,,,,,,,,,
664,Kyle,3,"Look, Cartman, I don't know what's gotten into you, but... I I think it's pretty amazing. And I think it's real. You have to understand why I didn't believe you before.",10,Southpark,168,31,,,,,,,,,
665,Cartman,3,"Yeah. I do understand, Kyle. I've been doing the wrong things for a long time. Doing things for my own selfish reasons. I just wanna do something right, you know? Just this one time.",10,Southpark,182,34,,,,,,,,,
666,Kyle,3,"It's a long trip, dude. You're gonna need help. We can try and get the episode pulled together.",10,Southpark,95,18,,,,,,,,,
667,Cartman,3,You know we might not even make it into the studio.,10,Southpark,51,11,,,,,,,,,
668,Kyle,3,"I know. But just like you, I feel like I have to try. People can really get hurt, and a joke just isn't worth that.",10,Southpark,115,25,,,,,,,,,
669,Cartman,3,So what made you change your mind?,10,Southpark,34,7,,,,,,,,,
670,Kyle,3,I got some sound advice... from an old friend. ,10,Southpark,47,9,,,,,,,,,
671,Cartman,3,"Well Kyle, we'd better get going.",10,Southpark,33,6,,,,,,,,,
672,Kyle,3,Yeah! ,10,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
673,Cartman,3,Are you set?,10,Southpark,12,3,,,,,,,,,
674,Kyle,3,I'm set! Let's do this!,10,Southpark,23,5,,,,,,,,,
675,Cartman,3,"All right, let's roll! ",10,Southpark,23,4,,,,,,,,,
677,Randy,3,"Well what are we gonna do, Mayor?! Part 2 of the Family Guy episode airs in six days!",10,Southpark,85,18,,,,,,,,,
683,Randy,3,I like the sand idea.,10,Southpark,21,5,,,,,,,,,
687,Kyle,3,"We got six days to make it to Los Angeles. If we keep our stops to a minimum, we should be able to get the episode pulled just in time.",10,Southpark,135,30,,,,,,,,,
688,Cartman,3,"Yes, and in just a few weeks from now, Family Guy will be off the air forever.",10,Southpark,78,17,,,,,,,,,
689,Kyle,3,Off the air? But... we're just going to try to get the Mohammad episode pulled.,10,Southpark,79,15,,,,,,,,,
690,Cartman,3,"It's simple television economics, Kyle. All it takes to kill a show forever is get one episode pulled. If we convince the network to pull this episode for the sake of Muslims, then the Catholics can demand a show they don't like get pulled. And then people with disabilities can demand another show get pulled. And so on and so on, until Family Guy is no more! It's exactly what happened to Laverne & Shirley.",10,Southpark,409,75,,,,,,,,,
691,Kyle,3,Whoa whoa wait a minute!  This isn't what I signed up for! I like Family Guy. Why do we have to get it off the air forever?,10,Southpark,123,27,,,,,,,,,
692,Cartman,3,"Because they made f-fun of Muslims, and and that's wrong.",10,Southpark,57,10,,,,,,,,,
693,Kyle,3,But that doesn't mean it has to go off the air. You should like that show. Your sense of humor is just like Family Guy.,10,Southpark,119,25,,,,,,,,,
694,Cartman,3,"Don't you EVER, EVER, compare me to Family Guy! You hear me Kyle??!! Compare me to Family Guy again, and so help me I will kill you where you stand! ",10,Southpark,149,30,,,,,,,,,
695,Kyle,3,You unbelievable son of a bitch. You never cared about the Muslim religion. Or the safety of people in America. You just want Family Guy off the air!,10,Southpark,149,28,,,,,,,,,
696,Cartman,3,"Do you have any idea what it's like?! Everywhere I go, ""Hey Cartman, you must like Family Guy, right?"" ""Hey, your sense of humor reminds me of Family Guy, Cartman.""  I am NOTHING like Family Guy! When I make jokes, they are inherent to a story! Deep, situational and emotional jokes based on what is relevant and has a POINT! Not just one interchangeable joke after another!!",10,Southpark,375,67,,,,,,,,,
697,Kyle,3,What are you talking about?!,10,Southpark,28,5,,,,,,,,,
698,Cartman,3,YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!,10,Southpark,21,3,,,,,,,,,
699,Kyle,3,I can't believe I let you scare me into taking your side. You used fear to make me stop believing in free speech.,10,Southpark,113,23,,,,,,,,,
700,Cartman,3,Well... I guess you won't be helping me now. No biggie. I don't NEED you to get the episode pulled! ,10,Southpark,100,20,,,,,,,,,
701,Kyle,3,No!  I am NOT letting you go to that television studio and pretend... to care about safety and sensitivity to get a show you don't like off the air!,10,Southpark,148,29,,,,,,,,,
702,Cartman,3,"Well then Kyle, I guess we- ...Oh my God, is that Tim McGraw?",10,Southpark,61,13,,,,,,,,,
703,Kyle,3,What?  CARTMAN! ,10,Southpark,16,2,,,,,,,,,
704,Cartman,3,"Kyle, stop it!",10,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,
705,Cartman,3,Holy Crap! ,10,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
706,Kyle,3,Ahhh!,10,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
709,Stan,3,"Dad, I don't wanna bury my head in the sand.",10,Southpark,44,10,,,,,,,,,
710,Randy,3,"It's the best say, Stanley. Did you eat your Fruit Roll-Up?",10,Southpark,59,11,,,,,,,,,
711,Stan,3,Yeah.,10,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
712,Randy,3,"All right, make sure your snorkel is working.  All right, now get your head in the hole.",10,Southpark,88,17,,,,,,,,,
713,Stan,3,"Dad, this is stupid.",10,Southpark,20,4,,,,,,,,,
714,Randy,3,"Stanley, there's no time for your immaturity! Do it!  All right Sharon, now do me. ",10,Southpark,83,15,,,,,,,,,
724,Kyle,3,No!  AAAAH!  AAAAH! ,10,Southpark,20,3,,,,,,,,,
725,Cartman,3,"Hahahaha! So long, Kyle!",10,Southpark,24,4,,,,,,,,,
726,Kyle,3,You son of a bitch! I won't let you win! You hear me?!,10,Southpark,54,13,,,,,,,,,
727,Cartman,3,"Suck mah balls, Kyle! ",10,Southpark,22,4,,,,,,,,,
735,Cartman,3,This... explains everything.,10,Southpark,28,3,,,,,,,,,
739,Cartman,3,"Kyle, quit it! Stop it, Kyle!",10,Southpark,29,6,,,,,,,,,
744,Cartman,4,I'm gonna do whatever I can... to get that episode pulled before this gets out of hand.,10,Southpark,87,17,,,,,,,,,
745,Kyle,4,You just want Family Guy off the air...,10,Southpark,39,8,,,,,,,,,
746,Cartman,4,"Kyle, stop it!",10,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,
747,Cartman,4,"So long, Kyle!",10,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,
748,Kyle,4,You son of a bitch! I won't let you win!,10,Southpark,40,10,,,,,,,,,
766,Cartman,4,"Ma'am, I need to speak to the president of this network right away.",10,Southpark,67,13,,,,,,,,,
768,Cartman,4,"It's regarding Family Guy. I demand that the Mohammad episode be pulled before it airs tonight! It's incendiary, it's offensive to Muslims, and people can get hurt! It's wrong! It's WROOONG!",10,Southpark,190,31,,,,,,,,,
770,Cartman,4,"Dude, can I go before you?",10,Southpark,26,6,,,,,,,,,
772,Kyle,4,"What the hell is going on?  Hello?  Excuse me, I need to get to Los Angeles.  Hello?! ",10,Southpark,86,17,,,,,,,,,
779,Kyle,4,Who?,10,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
781,Cartman,4,"So... you don't like Family Guy either, huh?",10,Southpark,44,8,,,,,,,,,
783,Cartman,4,So what's your plan? You're gonna ask the president of the network nicely to take it off the air?,10,Southpark,97,19,,,,,,,,,
785,Cartman,4,"Look, kid, if you hate a TV show, all you have to do is get an episode pulled. Pretty soon the show is compromised and it goes off the air.",10,Southpark,139,30,,,,,,,,,
787,Cartman,4,Yes. So my plan is to use this whole Mohammad thing as a way to scare the network into pulling tonight's show. I'm going to use fear to get them to do what I want.,10,Southpark,163,35,,,,,,,,,
789,Cartman,4,"...No, it isn't like terrorism. It IS terrorism.",10,Southpark,48,8,,,,,,,,,
791,Cartman,4,This is manipulation at its highest lever; you should let me handle this.,10,Southpark,73,13,,,,,,,,,
793,Cartman,4,Really? What's the worst thing you've ever done?,10,Southpark,48,8,,,,,,,,,
795,Cartman,4,"Wow, that's pretty hardcore. Geez. That's like this one time, when I didn't like a kid, so I ground his parents up into chili and fed it to him.",10,Southpark,144,29,,,,,,,,,
797,Cartman,4,Seeya.,10,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
821,Cartman,4,"Hello, gentlemen, ladies. My name is little Danny Pocket. And I won't take much of your time. Please excuse my tiny crutch; it's the only way I can get around these days. Ow...",10,Southpark,176,33,,,,,,,,,
823,Cartman,4,"You see, my father worked for a newspaper in my native country of Denmark. His newspaper showed an image of Mohammad and, two days later, terrorists suicides bombed his building. I was in the lobby when it happened.  First one terrorist suicide bombed us and, then dozens more. They just kept coming. Suicide bombers running in the building and blowing up one after another! They were like Mexican jumping beans. I just don't wanna see people here at your studio getting hurt, because... that would be, of course, your responsibility.  Ow..",10,Southpark,540,91,,,,,,,,,
827,Cartman,4,I'll certainly do my best.  Ow.,10,Southpark,31,6,,,,,,,,,
829,Cartman,4,"Yes, and then Family Guy is as good as dead.",10,Southpark,44,10,,,,,,,,,
831,Cartman,4,"I I said ""thank you."" Thank you for listening. ",10,Southpark,47,9,,,,,,,,,
832,Kyle,4,Thanks a lot for the ride.,10,Southpark,26,6,,,,,,,,,
834,Kyle,4,I'll do everything I can.,10,Southpark,25,5,,,,,,,,,
836,Kyle,4,Excuse me.  Do you know which way the network president's office is?,10,Southpark,68,12,,,,,,,,,
838,Kyle,4,"Look, my fat bastard friend is trying to trick the network into getting Family Guy off the air.",10,Southpark,95,18,,,,,,,,,
840,Kyle,4,"Oh thanks, dude.",10,Southpark,16,3,,,,,,,,,
842,Kyle,4,"Hello? This can't be right, I-  Ow!",10,Southpark,35,7,,,,,,,,,
848,Cartman,4,"It won't take long, sir.  Ow...",10,Southpark,31,6,,,,,,,,,
850,Cartman,4,"Yes, I'm totally excited. Family Guy is so funny.",10,Southpark,49,9,,,,,,,,,
852,Cartman,4,Wha?  What are they?,10,Southpark,20,4,,,,,,,,,
854,Cartman,4,"Family Guy is written by manatees?  Of course, it all makes sense now.",10,Southpark,70,13,,,,,,,,,
860,Cartman,4,Waitwaitaminute waitaminute. These... manatees demanded that Mohammad be shown? How? Manatees don't talk!,10,Southpark,105,13,,,,,,,,,
862,Cartman,4,"Oh... yes, yes. Um  hello, manatees. I, I think you should allow the network to pull your episode with Mohammad. See, I'm the victim of a, a terrorist attack and... terrorists might come after you if you-",10,Southpark,204,37,,,,,,,,,
864,Cartman,4,Why not?,10,Southpark,8,2,,,,,,,,,
866,Cartman,4,Son of a bitch.,10,Southpark,15,4,,,,,,,,,
867,Kyle,4,"Let me out of here, kid! Why are you doing this?",10,Southpark,48,11,,,,,,,,,
868,Cartman,4,Well well well! ,10,Southpark,16,3,,,,,,,,,
869,Kyle,4,Cartman!,10,Southpark,8,1,,,,,,,,,
870,Cartman,4,"Hello, Kyle. Looks like you've run into a little snag in your plan as well.",10,Southpark,75,15,,,,,,,,,
871,Kyle,4,You fat sun of a bitch!,10,Southpark,23,6,,,,,,,,,
872,Cartman,4,"You came so close to stopping me, didn't you, Kyle. There was just one thing you didn't count on: that more people besides me hate Family Guy.",10,Southpark,142,27,,,,,,,,,
874,Kyle,4,"Well, a lot of people like Family Guy too! Who are you to decide it shouldn't be on the air?!",10,Southpark,93,20,,,,,,,,,
876,Cartman,4,"Not yet! But I've come up with a new plan. I've learned how to make the Family Guy writing staff stop working! As soon as everyone goes on their lunch break, I can sneak back in.",10,Southpark,178,36,,,,,,,,,
878,Kyle,4,"Cartman, let me out of this stupid net!!",10,Southpark,40,8,,,,,,,,,
879,Cartman,4,"Good, Kyle! That's good anger you're showin' there! See that?! That's emotional character development based on what's happening in the storyline! Not at all like Family Guy. Now, if you'll excuse me, Kyle,  I've got some idea balls to remove from a manatee tank.",10,Southpark,262,44,,,,,,,,,
880,Kyle,4,WHAT?!,10,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
886,Cartman,4,"Sir! Sir!  If you don't my saying, I think you asked for this. You gave in to the manatees last week. Now they know all they have to do is refuse to work and they can get whatever they want. You spoiled them by caving in. Now they thnk they can walk all over you.  Sir, you are in charge of this network, not them. Maybe it's time you showed them who's in charge.",10,Southpark,363,74,,,,,,,,,
890,Cartman,4,I did it. I... AM... GOD!!!,10,Southpark,27,6,,,,,,,,,
891,Cartman,4,"Family Guy is going off the air! No more Family Guy for me, mon fr’re!",10,Southpark,70,15,,,,,,,,,
892,Kyle,4,Cartman!!  You fucking fatass!,10,Southpark,30,4,,,,,,,,,
893,Cartman,4,How the hell did you get out?,10,Southpark,29,7,,,,,,,,,
894,Kyle,4,That kid and I had a long talk! I told him he was on a slippery slope to becoming a monster like you!,10,Southpark,101,23,,,,,,,,,
895,Cartman,4,"Aw, God damnit, you gave him one of your gay little speeches, didn't you?!",10,Southpark,74,14,,,,,,,,,
896,Kyle,4,You are NOT KILLING FAMILY GUY!!,10,Southpark,32,6,,,,,,,,,
897,Cartman,4,"You're too late, Kyle! The president of the network is pulling the episode! Family Guy is as good as dead!",10,Southpark,106,20,,,,,,,,,
898,Kyle,4,There's still time to tell the network president you're full of CRAP! ,10,Southpark,70,12,,,,,,,,,
899,Cartman,4,I can't let you do that!,10,Southpark,24,6,,,,,,,,,
900,Kyle,4,Get out of my way or I'll kick your ass!,10,Southpark,40,10,,,,,,,,,
901,Cartman,4,"Fine, Kyle. I guess it was inevitable.  Let this be our final battle.  Ow. OW! Stop it! Kyle, that's too hard! Ah!  Ugh. Kyle! Stop it!",10,Southpark,135,26,,,,,,,,,
902,Kyle,4,Ow. Quit it!,10,Southpark,12,3,,,,,,,,,
903,Cartman,4,"Ow. Quit it, Kyle! Bleh. Kyle! ",10,Southpark,31,6,,,,,,,,,
904,Cartman,4,Stop it!,10,Southpark,8,2,,,,,,,,,
905,Kyle,4,Ow. Quit it!,10,Southpark,12,3,,,,,,,,,
906,Cartman,4,"Ow. Quit it, Kyle! Leh- Kyle! Let go- Okay okay come on, time out. Kyle, time out! Time out! Time out.  Time in!  I d-ow! Uh. Ah. Sh-gah. Okay. Okay. Time out! Kyle t-time out! Time out! Time out! Time out! Time out!",10,Southpark,216,43,,,,,,,,,
907,Kyle,4,"No more timeouts, fatass!",10,Southpark,25,4,,,,,,,,,
908,Cartman,4,"Time out! Time out! Time out, Kyle! Ay! Ay!",10,Southpark,43,9,,,,,,,,,
909,Cartman,4,"Kyle! Kyle! Get the... Get the- Kyle! Kyle, dude, that was- that was in the balls! Dude, serious- seriously! That was in the balls! No hitting- No hitting in the balls!  Kyle!  Quit it, Kyle. Give it up, Kyle!  Okay... Okay! Okay okay!  You win! You win. I give up.  Hahaha! I had my fingers crossed. ",10,Southpark,301,56,,,,,,,,,
910,Kyle,4,"Thanks, kid.",10,Southpark,12,2,,,,,,,,,
918,Kyle,4,Sir! Mister television executive! Stop!,10,Southpark,39,5,,,,,,,,,
920,Kyle,4,Listen to me: the little boy who convinced you to pull the episode is a bastard child. He only wants you to pull it because he knows it will be the end of Family Guy forever!,10,Southpark,174,36,,,,,,,,,
924,Kyle,4,Pulling an episode because someone is offended starts a chain reaction. You'll have to pull more and more episodes until the show goes off the air completely. It's what happened to Laverne & Shirley.,10,Southpark,199,34,,,,,,,,,
926,Kyle,4,What manatees??!! ,10,Southpark,18,2,,,,,,,,,
927,Cartman,4,"Go ahead, Mr. President! Continue what you were doing!",10,Southpark,54,9,,,,,,,,,
928,Kyle,4,"No! You have to show Mohammad, Mr. President!",10,Southpark,45,8,,,,,,,,,
930,Kyle,4,"Sir, just think about what you're doing to free speech!",10,Southpark,55,10,,,,,,,,,
931,Cartman,4,No! Think about the people who could get hurt!,10,Southpark,46,9,,,,,,,,,
933,Cartman,4,"Okay, I'll make it easy for you.  Pull the Mohammad episode, now!",10,Southpark,65,12,,,,,,,,,
935,Kyle,4,Noo! Wait! You can't listen to him! He's a lying deceitful monster who only wants Family Guy off the air!,10,Southpark,105,20,,,,,,,,,
937,Kyle,4,You can't do what he wants just because he's the one threatening you with violence!,10,Southpark,83,15,,,,,,,,,
938,Cartman,4,"Shut up, Kyle!",10,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,
940,Kyle,4,"Yes, people can get hurt. That's how terrorism works. But if you give into that, Doug, you're allowing terrorism to work. Do the right thing here.",10,Southpark,146,26,,,,,,,,,
941,Cartman,4,"Give the orders to pull the episode, Mr. President!",10,Southpark,51,9,,,,,,,,,
944,Kyle,4,"Do the right thing, Mr. President.",10,Southpark,34,6,,,,,,,,,
946,Kyle,4,"I wish that was good enough, but if you censor out Mohammad, then soon you'll have to censor out more.",10,Southpark,102,20,,,,,,,,,
947,Cartman,4,"No gay speeches, Kyle!",10,Southpark,22,4,,,,,,,,,
948,Kyle,4,"If you don't show Mohammad, then you've made a distinction what is okay to poke fun at, and what isn't. Either it's all okay, or none of it is.",10,Southpark,143,29,,,,,,,,,
950,Kyle,4,Do the right thing. Show Mohammad.  Do. The right. Thing.,10,Southpark,57,10,,,,,,,,,
953,Kyle,4,Yes! ,10,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
954,Cartman,4,"No! No, I hate Family Guy!! ",10,Southpark,28,6,,,,,,,,,
1227,Kyle,6,Dick Cheney?,10,Southpark,12,2,,,,,,,,,
1229,Butters,6,Bill Clinton.,10,Southpark,13,2,,,,,,,,,
1231,Stan,6,Who?,10,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
1233,Kyle,6,ManBearPig? ,10,Southpark,12,1,,,,,,,,,
1237,Cartman,6,"Check out this sweet move.  Kyle, you can't block like that.",10,Southpark,60,11,,,,,,,,,
1238,Kyle,6,"Just play the game, fatass!",10,Southpark,27,5,,,,,,,,,
1239,Stan,6,"Pass it to me, Cartman?",10,Southpark,23,5,,,,,,,,,
1240,Cartman,6,"Hang on. I'm going to do something killer.  God damnit, stop it, Kyle!",10,Southpark,70,13,,,,,,,,,
1241,Cartman,6,"All right, check it out. This is a total Kobe Bryant I'm about to do. ",10,Southpark,70,15,,,,,,,,,
1242,Kyle,6,"Just take a shot or pass the ball, asshole! It's getting late!",10,Southpark,62,12,,,,,,,,,
1243,Cartman,6,"Let's just see who gets the ball this time, Jewboy!  Kyle, knock it off! ",10,Southpark,73,14,,,,,,,,,
1244,Stan,6,"Cartman, stop hogging the goddamned ball!",10,Southpark,41,6,,,,,,,,,
1246,Kyle,6,We know. ,10,Southpark,9,2,,,,,,,,,
1247,Cartman,6,"Dude, what are you doing?",10,Southpark,25,5,,,,,,,,,
1249,Randy,6,"Uhh, Stan?",10,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,
1250,Stan,6,"Oh, hey Dad.",10,Southpark,12,3,,,,,,,,,
1252,Randy,6,"It's ah, getting late, boys. Why don't you get in the car and I'll drive you all home?",10,Southpark,86,18,,,,,,,,,
1253,Kyle,6,"Okay, Mr. Marsh. ",10,Southpark,17,3,,,,,,,,,
1255,Randy,6,"Boys, I don't want you hanging out with that ex vice-president anymore, okay?",10,Southpark,77,13,,,,,,,,,
1256,Stan,6,"Aw, he's all right, Dad. He was just trying to warn us about ManBearPig.",10,Southpark,72,14,,,,,,,,,
1257,Randy,6,ManBearPig?,10,Southpark,11,1,,,,,,,,,
1258,Kyle,6,He's half man and half bearpig,10,Southpark,30,6,,,,,,,,,
1259,Cartman,6,"No, dude, he's half man and half bear and half pig.",10,Southpark,51,11,,,,,,,,,
1260,Kyle,6,That doesn't make any sense.,10,Southpark,28,5,,,,,,,,,
1261,Stan,6,"He could be half bear, half manpig.",10,Southpark,35,7,,,,,,,,,
1262,Randy,6,"Boys, there's no such thing as a ManBearPig. The vice president is just desperate for attention.",10,Southpark,96,16,,,,,,,,,
1263,Stan,6,"But I feel kind of bad for him, Dad. I don't think he has any friends.",10,Southpark,70,16,,,,,,,,,
1264,Stan,6,Hello?,10,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
1266,Stan,6,Oh man... Hi Mr. Gore.,10,Southpark,22,5,,,,,,,,,
1268,Stan,6,I know.,10,Southpark,7,2,,,,,,,,,
1270,Stan,6,"Eh look, I'm sorry but, we're all kind of busy.",10,Southpark,47,10,,,,,,,,,
1272,Stan,6,"No, no, it's not that.",10,Southpark,22,5,,,,,,,,,
1274,Stan,6,"Ih it's okay, Mr. Gore, I, I believe you.",10,Southpark,41,9,,,,,,,,,
1276,Stan,6,"Yeah, I'm sure ManBearPig needs to be stopped. I'm just... I'm just scared that I can't do anything to stop him.",10,Southpark,112,21,,,,,,,,,
1278,Stan,6,"...Yes, I'm serial.",10,Southpark,19,3,,,,,,,,,
1280,Cartman,6,"Dude, why are we going to hang out with this guy?",10,Southpark,49,11,,,,,,,,,
1281,Kenny,6,,10,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
1282,Stan,6,"Come on, you guys, Al Gore doesn't have any friends. We'll just make an appearance at his little meeting and then we'll go. ",10,Southpark,124,23,,,,,,,,,
1284,Stan,6,"Yyeah, you know, Mr. Gore, uh, my dad's a geologist, and he said that ManBearPig probably isn't in Colorado.",10,Southpark,108,19,,,,,,,,,
1286,Stan,6,NO.,10,Southpark,3,1,,,,,,,,,
1288,Stan,6,"Well, this was a great meeting. Wasn't it, guys? But, we gotta get goin' to school now.",10,Southpark,87,17,,,,,,,,,

1293,Kyle,6,"Yeah, we've got school anyway.",10,Southpark,30,5,,,,,,,,,
1295,Cartman,6,You... have that kind of power?,10,Southpark,31,6,,,,,,,,,
1304,Kyle,6,What do ManBearPig droppings look like?,10,Southpark,39,6,,,,,,,,,
1312,Kyle,6,What?,10,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
1317,Stan,6,"Mr. Gore, I I think we should stay with the tour group.",10,Southpark,55,12,,,,,,,,,
1319,Kyle,6,What are you doing?! ,10,Southpark,21,4,,,,,,,,,
1320,Stan,6,Oh no!,10,Southpark,6,2,,,,,,,,,

1337,Cartman,6,"You'd better get us out of here, asshole!",10,Southpark,41,8,,,,,,,,,
1338,Stan,6,Me??,10,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
1339,Cartman,6,You just had to go and be nice to Al Gore! Now we're trapped in a cave!,10,Southpark,71,17,,,,,,,,,
1340,Stan,6,Maybe there's another way out of here.,10,Southpark,38,7,,,,,,,,,
1341,Kenny,6,,10,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
1342,Kyle,6,"A-all right, let's split up and look for a passageway. E-everyone take a different direction.  Oh man, we're in big trouble here.",10,Southpark,129,22,,,,,,,,,
1343,Cartman,6,This is... bullcrap! If I'm thin- I'm gonna be so... pissed off!  Goddammit! ,10,Southpark,77,13,,,,,,,,,
1344,Kyle,6,"You see anything, Kenny??",10,Southpark,25,4,,,,,,,,,

1349,Cartman,6,I'm fine! This way is just a... dead end! Coming back to you now! ,10,Southpark,66,14,,,,,,,,,
1350,Kyle,6,It looks like we're completely sealed in.,10,Southpark,41,7,,,,,,,,,
1351,Kenny,6,,10,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
1352,Stan,6,"There's a small passageway about 200 yards over there, but... it goes for a long long way and it's pretty steep. ",10,Southpark,113,21,,,,,,,,,
1353,Kyle,6,Maybe we should go for it.,10,Southpark,26,6,,,,,,,,,
1354,Cartman,6,"You guys go on ahead. I'm gonna... stay here, wait it out. ",10,Southpark,59,12,,,,,,,,,
1355,Kyle,6,Why?,10,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
1356,Cartman,6,"I just... I I don't feel very good. I'll just wa-, I'll just weigh you guys down.",10,Southpark,81,17,,,,,,,,,
1357,Stan,6,Cartman's right. First rule of survival is stay put and wait to be rescued.,10,Southpark,75,14,,,,,,,,,
1358,Cartman,6,"No, it's okay. You guys go on ahead.",10,Southpark,36,8,,,,,,,,,
1359,Kyle,6,"No, we'll stay here too. If we start wandering off, we're gonna get lost or killed. Let's just wait here and hope help comes soon.",10,Southpark,130,25,,,,,,,,,
1360,Cartman,6,That's cool. I just... I just wouldn't go over there  if I were you guys. I just took a huge dump.,10,Southpark,98,21,,,,,,,,,
1361,Kyle,6,"Aw, dude! ",10,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,
1371,Stan,6,I'm sooo hungry. Do you think people even know we're here?,10,Southpark,58,11,,,,,,,,,
1372,Kyle,6,"They saw us on the tour.  Dude, where do you keep going, Cartman?",10,Southpark,65,13,,,,,,,,,
1373,Cartman,6,"I just... n-need to keep taking a crap. I got diarrhea, really bad.",10,Southpark,67,13,,,,,,,,,
1374,Kyle,6,"Dude, it's bad enough we have to sit here without you taking a crap every ten minutes!",10,Southpark,86,17,,,,,,,,,
1375,Stan,6,Let's just try to sleep. Maybe help will come tomorrow.,10,Southpark,55,10,,,,,,,,,
1376,Cartman,6,"All that treasure.  It's all mine!  So long as these greedy assholes don't find out about it!  You would all just looove to get your hands on my treasure, wouldn't you?! Even though I found it, you'd love to think it's somehow yours, too! God, I hate you guys!  Especially you, you money-grubbing snake in the grass!  Well I have news for you, Kyle! You're never going to get my treasure. I've got a little plan going, to get the treasure out of here without you ever knowing. ",10,Southpark,477,88,,,,,,,,,
1377,Kyle,6,C-Cartman?,10,Southpark,10,1,,,,,,,,,
1378,Cartman,6,Oh. Hey Kyle. How's it goin'?,10,Southpark,29,6,,,,,,,,,
1379,Kyle,6,"Dude, what are you doing?",10,Southpark,25,5,,,,,,,,,
1380,Cartman,6,"Not much. You know, just hangin' out. How've you been, man? Good?",10,Southpark,65,12,,,,,,,,,
1381,Kyle,6,"Dude, get away from me!",10,Southpark,23,5,,,,,,,,,
1382,Cartman,6,"Yeah. It's nice talking with you, Kyle. See you around. ",10,Southpark,56,10,,,,,,,,,
1390,Cartman,6,All right. Gotta be strong.  There's still a lot more treasure to go. ,10,Southpark,70,13,,,,,,,,,
1391,Stan,6,"Dude, he's really sick. ",10,Southpark,24,4,,,,,,,,,
1397,Kyle,6,"Stan! Stan, wake up!",10,Southpark,20,4,,,,,,,,,
1398,Stan,6,Huh? What? Have they come for us?,10,Southpark,33,7,,,,,,,,,
1399,Kyle,6,"No, it's Cartman. Something's really wrong with him. ",10,Southpark,53,8,,,,,,,,,
1400,Cartman,6,"Meh, meuh urgh.  Mbeuh.",10,Southpark,23,4,,,,,,,,,
1401,Stan,6,"Oh my God.  Cartman? Dude, can you hear me?",10,Southpark,43,9,,,,,,,,,
1402,Cartman,6,I'm fahn. Just a lit-  No big deal.  Beh.,10,Southpark,41,9,,,,,,,,,
1403,Kyle,6,"We can't wait here any longer! Dude, we've gotta get him out of here or he's gonna die.",10,Southpark,87,18,,,,,,,,,

1463,Cartman,7,"Okay, I'm sorry I handcuffed Billy Turner's ankle to a flagpole and then gave him a hacksaw. And then told him I had poisoned his lunch milk and that the only way he could get to the antidote in time would be to saw through his leg.",10,Southpark,232,47,,,,,,,,,

1522,Cartman,7,"Well, I'm feeling confused, because I don't understand why you became a nanny.",10,Southpark,78,13,,,,,,,,,
1524,Cartman,7,"Right, but... if you love children so much, how come you're not a mommy?",10,Southpark,72,14,,,,,,,,,
1526,Cartman,7,Why not?,10,Southpark,8,2,,,,,,,,,
1528,Cartman,7,"You're sterile, is that it?  No, that's too convenient of an excuse. The truth is, nobody ever wanted to have babies with you. Isn't that it?  Always the mom's maid and never the mom? Must be hard on you, knowing that the years are ticking away, your friends all getting married and all the while your uterus is slowly shriveling away, drying up, becoming totally worthless.",10,Southpark,374,66,,,,,,,,,
1532,Cartman,7,"Yes, let the anger come! Strike me down while you can! But it won't make your dried-up ovaries any more fertile! ",10,Southpark,113,21,,,,,,,,,

1627,Butters,7,"Oh boy, Park Avenue! I'm rich! ",10,Southpark,31,6,,,,,,,,,
1628,Cartman,7,"Hey guys, I've got some pretty big news.  I ran away from home. Yeah, my mom just... doesn't care about me anymore, so I moved out. She didn't even try to stop me. It's gonna be tough livin' on my own. But I'll get by, somehow.",10,Southpark,227,46,,,,,,,,,
1629,Stan,7,You can't stay here.,10,Southpark,20,4,,,,,,,,,
1630,Cartman,7,Maybe you didn't hear me! I ran away! I don't have anywhere to sleep! I'm out on the street!,10,Southpark,92,19,,,,,,,,,
1631,Kyle,7,You'er not staying at my house either.,10,Southpark,38,7,,,,,,,,,
1632,Cartman,7,"All right, that's fine! Butters, I'll crash with you.",10,Southpark,53,9,,,,,,,,,
1633,Butters,7,"No, my parents won't let me bring homeless people home anymore.",10,Southpark,63,11,,,,,,,,,

1635,Kenny,7,,10,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
1636,Cartman,7,"Och! Well, I guess now we see just how supportive friends can be! When the chips are down you won't even lend a hand! I'll just go sleep on the street somewhere!  Out in the cold! Probably get mugged and gang-raped by some minorities! You guys'll be sorry when I turn up dead! ",10,Southpark,277,53,,,,,,,,,
1637,Butters,7,Whoopie! G and R Railroad!,10,Southpark,26,5,,,,,,,,,
1638,Cartman,7,"Hey Jimmy. You're not gonna believe this, but... I ran away from home. I just... I really need the support of my best friend right now.",10,Southpark,135,26,,,,,,,,,
1640,Cartman,7,"You are, Jimmy! We've always been best friends. We know everything about each other.",10,Southpark,84,14,,,,,,,,,
1642,Cartman,7,"Goddammit!  Craig, dude, I ran away from home. You're the first person I came to. I knew you'd take me in off the streets.",10,Southpark,122,24,,,,,,,,,
1644,Cartman,7,...Should that really matter at a time like this?,10,Southpark,49,9,,,,,,,,,
1645,Cartman,7,This is bullcrap! Mom'll break soon. I can outlast her.,10,Southpark,55,10,,,,,,,,,
1646,Cartman,7,"All right, I'm back.",10,Southpark,20,4,,,,,,,,,
1648,Cartman,7,"Yes, well, hopefully you've learned your lesson! I've come back, but there's going to be some changes around here.",10,Southpark,114,19,,,,,,,,,
1650,Cartman,7,That's super-interesting. But I've been out living in the streets for almost four hours! Make me something to eat.,10,Southpark,114,19,,,,,,,,,
1653,Cartman,7,"Aw, Goddammit!",10,Southpark,14,2,,,,,,,,,
1656,Cartman,7,What is he still doing here?!,10,Southpark,29,6,,,,,,,,,
1659,Cartman,7,"What the hell is this?! Skinless chicken, boiled vegetables and salad?! This is just like Auschwitz!",10,Southpark,100,16,,,,,,,,,
1661,Cartman,7,Oh my God. Bite-size Snickers? That's it. I'm calling child-protective services! ,10,Southpark,81,11,,,,,,,,,
1665,Cartman,7,"Mom, I want this guy OUT of here! You got it? If he's not gone, in two minutes, I will call social services on you!",10,Southpark,115,25,,,,,,,,,
1667,Cartman,7,"I am your son, and you will listen to me! You have no right to-",10,Southpark,63,15,,,,,,,,,

1675,Cartman,7,Mom?!,10,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
1677,Cartman,7,Mom? Mom...,10,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
1691,Cartman,7,Who does she think telling me to go brush my teeth?!  Jesus. What's happening to me?,10,Southpark,84,16,,,,,,,,,
1700,Cartman,7,"Guys, listen up. I really need your help this time. I've thought about it a lot and I've decided I have to kill my mom.",10,Southpark,119,25,,,,,,,,,
1701,Butters,7,Kill your mom?,10,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,
1702,Cartman,7,"She doesn't let me wear whatever I want anymore. Things have really gotten out of hand! My mom must die so I can have a place to live, but without her trying to run my life. She's like Hitler with all the demands she makes.",10,Southpark,223,45,,,,,,,,,
1703,Stan,7,"Dude, have you lost more weight?",10,Southpark,32,6,,,,,,,,,
1704,Cartman,7,Yes! I've lost almost ten pounds now. You see what I mean?? I totally know how it felt to be a Jew in the Holocaust now! I have to kill my mom. It's my only way out.,10,Southpark,165,37,,,,,,,,,
1705,Kyle,7,"Dude, don't kill your mom. That's not cool.",10,Southpark,43,8,,,,,,,,,
1706,Cartman,7,"She's Hitler! Would you have killed Hitler if you had the chance?!  All right now, here's the plan. At 9:45 tonight I will sneak out of my room and leave the house, leaving the back door unlocked.  You guys come into the house at 10:30 p.m. sharp, having given me enough time to get down to Perkins to be seen by everyone there. And then all four of you go upstairs to kill my mom.",10,Southpark,381,75,,,,,,,,,
1707,Stan,7,"Dude, we're not killing your mom.",10,Southpark,33,6,,,,,,,,,
1708,Cartman,7,"Well I can't kill her. I'm too obvious a suspect. Now, when you reach her room, Butters will keep a lookout while Kenny opens the bedroom door, Kyle puts a pillow over my mom's head, and Stan shoots her in the face.",10,Southpark,215,42,,,,,,,,,
1709,Stan,7,Where am I supposed to get a gun?,10,Southpark,33,8,,,,,,,,,
1710,Cartman,7,"Well I don't know. That's your job, Stan! Do I have to think of everything here?!",10,Southpark,81,16,,,,,,,,,
1711,Stan,7,I'm not shooting anybody.,10,Southpark,25,4,,,,,,,,,
1712,Cartman,7,"Okay, fine. Butters, you cover my mom's head with a pillow and Kyle can shoot her in the face.",10,Southpark,94,19,,,,,,,,,
1713,Kyle,7,"NO, Cartman!",10,Southpark,12,2,,,,,,,,,
1714,Cartman,7,Oh! Well how about I do everything?! How does that sound?! I'll just do everything while you guys sit here and play video games?!  Fine! I'll do it by myself!,10,Southpark,158,30,,,,,,,,,
1715,Cartman,7,"You forced me to do this! You couldn't just love me as a son.  You just had to humiliate and degrade me with your rules. I won't let you dominate my life anymore!  Goodbye, Mother. ",10,Southpark,181,35,,,,,,,,,
1717,Cartman,7,"No! She's my mom, I can do whatever I want with her! It's more important that I live the way I want!",10,Southpark,100,22,,,,,,,,,
1719,Cartman,7,She isn't an object I can own. Sh-she's a human being.,10,Southpark,54,11,,,,,,,,,
1721,Cartman,7,Ugh. Eh. Maybe all these changes are good for me. Maybe...,10,Southpark,58,11,,,,,,,,,
1723,Cartman,7,Maybe the world doesn't revolve around me. ,10,Southpark,43,7,,,,,,,,,
1727,Cartman,7,"Yeah Mom, it's okay. It's grapefruit and lean han.",10,Southpark,50,9,,,,,,,,,
1729,Cartman,7,"Well, you told me I had to review my homework before class started.",10,Southpark,67,13,,,,,,,,,
1731,Cartman,7,Tha... thank you?,10,Southpark,17,3,,,,,,,,,
1733,Cartman,7,"'K Mom, you're embarrassing me, jeez. ",10,Southpark,38,6,,,,,,,,,
1742,Cartman,7,"I cleared up the table, Mom. I'm gonna go upstairs and make my bed now. ",10,Southpark,72,15,,,,,,,,,
1744,Cartman,7,"No, that's okay. Besides, I told Stan and Kyle we could work on our science project then.",10,Southpark,89,17,,,,,,,,,
1746,Cartman,7,Could I... perhaps have... two Mega Rangers?,10,Southpark,44,7,,,,,,,,,
1748,Cartman,8,"Oh, dude! I just took the biggest crap. Hey-where are you guys?",10,Southpark,63,12,,,,,,,,,
1749,Kyle,8,"We're over here, by the cart. ",10,Southpark,30,6,,,,,,,,,
1750,Cartman,8,"Okay, I'm back.",10,Southpark,15,3,,,,,,,,,
1751,Stan,8,Dude! We've been waiting forever!,10,Southpark,33,5,,,,,,,,,
1752,Cartman,8,"Well, I'm sorry, I had to take a dump!",10,Southpark,38,9,,,,,,,,,
1753,Kyle,8,"If you didn't eat so much, you wouldn't have diarrhea all the time, fatass!",10,Southpark,75,14,,,,,,,,,

1760,Randy,8,Stan!,10,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
1761,Stan,8,What?!,10,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
1762,Randy,8,You've been on your computer all weekend. Shouldn't you go out and socialize with your friends?,10,Southpark,95,16,,,,,,,,,
1763,Stan,8,"I am socializing, r-tard. I'm logged on to an MMORPG with people from all over the world, and getting XP with my party using TeamSpeak.",10,Southpark,135,25,,,,,,,,,
1764,Randy,8,...I'm not a r-tard. ,10,Southpark,21,4,,,,,,,,,
1765,Stan,8,"All right, sorry guys. So where to now?",10,Southpark,39,8,,,,,,,,,
1766,Kyle,8,See where I am? It's this way. ,10,Southpark,31,7,,,,,,,,,
1767,Cartman,8,"Yeah, come on, let's go!  I am the mightiest dwarf in all of Azeroth!",10,Southpark,69,14,,,,,,,,,
1768,Kyle,8,"Wow, look at all these people playing right now.",10,Southpark,48,9,,,,,,,,,
1769,Cartman,8,"Yeah, it's bullcrap. I'll bet half these of these people are Koreans.",10,Southpark,69,12,,,,,,,,,
1770,Stan,8,Oh crap! It's that guy again! ,10,Southpark,30,6,,,,,,,,,
1771,Kyle,8,Who is this?,10,Southpark,12,3,,,,,,,,,
1772,Stan,8,This is the guy that kept killing us after you went to bed!,10,Southpark,59,13,,,,,,,,,
1773,Cartman,8,"Get out of here, asshole!",10,Southpark,25,5,,,,,,,,,
1774,Stan,8,He's a way higher level than us. It isn't fair.,10,Southpark,47,10,,,,,,,,,
1775,Kyle,8,It's all right. He can't kill us unless we agree to duel. ,10,Southpark,58,12,,,,,,,,,
1776,Stan,8,"Oh my God, he killed Kenny!",10,Southpark,27,6,,,,,,,,,
1777,Kyle,8,You bastard! ,10,Southpark,13,2,,,,,,,,,
1778,Cartman,8,Don't you have better things to do than going online killing people?!  No! I don't want them to start over at the graveyard!  No! ,10,Southpark,130,24,,,,,,,,,

2061,Cartman,9,"Kyle, why are you so afraid of the truth?!",10,Southpark,42,9,,,,,,,,,
2062,Kyle,9,Because anybody who thinks 9/11 was a conspiracy is a retard!,10,Southpark,61,11,,,,,,,,,
2063,Cartman,9,Oh really? Well did you know that over one-fourth of people in America think that 9/11 was a conspiracy? Are you saying that one-fourth of Americans are retards?,10,Southpark,161,28,,,,,,,,,

2068,Butters,9,"Hey, fellas!",10,Southpark,12,2,,,,,,,,,
2069,Cartman,9,"Butters, do you think 9/11 was just a plot by some angry terrorists, or do you think there was some kind of coverup?",10,Southpark,116,23,,,,,,,,,
2070,Butters,9,"Well, I heard that 9/11 was caused by President Bush.",10,Southpark,53,10,,,,,,,,,
2071,Cartman,9,Aha! Do you see?,10,Southpark,16,4,,,,,,,,,

2076,Butters,9,"Well, l-uh, I mean, uh, you never know. Uh, the government does some pretty spooky things. The government and the corporations headed by the Jews that tear down 9/11.",10,Southpark,166,29,,,,,,,,,

2081,Cartman,9,You guys are blind! I can't believe that everyone here is just buying into what they're told by the media!  I'm gonna go find out the truth. I'm gonna blow the lid off this whooole 9/11 conspiracy once and for all! ,10,Southpark,215,41,,,,,,,,,
2082,Kyle,9,Oh no...,10,Southpark,8,2,,,,,,,,,
2083,Cartman,9,"It is wrong for me to ask questions?Is it wrong to seek the truth?I just can't blindly accept their version.I can't base my logic on proof.Almost all the evidence points one way,But I'm like Charlie Sheen and Gloria Estefan:I need to know what really happenedOn 9/11-leven-leven-leven-leven.What really happenedOn 9/11?Of course. It's so obvious. How did we not see it before?",10,Southpark,376,60,,,,,,,,,

2090,Cartman,9,"We are told to believe that the fire from the jet fuel melted the steel framing of the towers,  which led to their collapse. But did you know jet fuel doesn't burn at a high enough temperature to melt steel?  We were told the Pentagon was hit by a hijacked plane as well,  but now look at this photo of the Pentagon. The hole is not nearly big enough. And if a plane hit it, where is the rest of the plane?",10,Southpark,406,82,,,,,,,,,
2092,Cartman,9,"So now, the inevitable question: if terrorists didn't cause 9/11, who did?  Remember that there are in fact two towers. Two minus one is one; one one - 11; two minus one is one; one one, and there are nine members on Silverstein's board of directors. That's nine-one-one. Nine-eleven. And take 2 - 1 + 9/11 and you get 12, which leads us all to the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks. . Kyle!",10,Southpark,388,73,,,,,,,,,
2093,Kyle,9,Me??!,10,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,

3439,Stan,14,"All right, you guys, this is it. The moment is here. We've been through a lot together, and according to every movie ever made, we're going to win this game.

It is my hope that this foundation will prove my commitment to the education of African-American students and erase once and for all my identity as the ""nigger"" guy.  You really... you really don't know how hard it is to be constantly reminded of something lame that happened in your past. I mean I... just wanna move on from what happened on ""Wheel of Fortune"", you know and... and when people call me... ""nigger guy""... they're bringing up a painful chapter of my history and all the negativity that went along with it. You just... you can't imagine how that feels. ",11,Southpark,666,116,,,,,,,,,

3608,Randy,1,Awww! Awwww! ,11,Southpark,13,2,,,,,,,,,
3611,Randy,1,Whoa! ,11,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
3613,Randy,1,"Please I, I don't want any trouble.",11,Southpark,35,7,,,,,,,,,
3617,Randy,1,What do you want?,11,Southpark,17,4,,,,,,,,,
3635,Randy,1,What's going on here?,11,Southpark,21,4,,,,,,,,,
3639,Randy,1,"No.  No no, I'm sorry, but I'm not... like you. I just said the N-word by mistake to win money.",11,Southpark,95,20,,,,,,,,,
3641,Randy,1,You said the N-word to a black man's face! That's way worse than what I did!,11,Southpark,76,16,,,,,,,,,
3643,Randy,1,No.,11,Southpark,3,1,,,,,,,,,
3645,Stan,1,"Now look, Token, I've done everything I can to make this right! You have no reason to still be mad!",11,Southpark,99,20,,,,,,,,,
3647,Stan,1,I'm not responsible for what my dad did!,11,Southpark,40,8,,,,,,,,,
3649,Stan,1,What the hell do you want from me?! ,11,Southpark,36,8,,,,,,,,,
3651,Stan,1,Then stop being mad!,11,Southpark,20,4,,,,,,,,,
3653,Butters,1,Fellas! Fellas come quick! Cartman's gonna fight the midget! ,11,Southpark,61,9,,,,,,,,,
3654,Butters,1,"All right, Eric, come on, Eric.",11,Southpark,31,6,,,,,,,,,
3655,Kyle,1,"Dude, are you sure you wanna do this? Apparently this guy has a black belt in karate.",11,Southpark,85,17,,,,,,,,,
3656,Cartman,1,"It's a midget, dude.",11,Southpark,20,4,,,,,,,,,
3658,Cartman,1,"Hahaha, no dude. It can't talk, that isn't fair, I'll laugh too much. ",11,Southpark,70,13,,,,,,,,,
3659,Randy,1,"Senators, I know it is not normally considered ""American"" to ban words.  But there is one slur that has caused so much damage that we believe it should finally be made illegal. I'm talking, of course, about the term ""nigger guy"".",11,Southpark,229,41,,,,,,,,,
3661,Randy,1,Two words which by themselves can be harmless but which together... form a verbal missile of hate.,11,Southpark,98,17,,,,,,,,,
3663,Randy,1,Oh sure. Some people just use the term in jest - tell a nigger guy joke or two thinking it's no big deal - but they don't realize it can lead to people using the term as an excuse for violence.,11,Southpark,193,41,,,,,,,,,
3665,Randy,1,"Senators, I've learned to admit that I'm capable of having- slightly racist thoughts once in a while. Can anybody say they never do? How long will it be before you are all called ""nigger guys""? ",11,Southpark,194,35,,,,,,,,,
3674,Randy,1,We did it!,11,Southpark,10,3,,,,,,,,,
3679,Cartman,1,"Say ""Uncle!""",11,Southpark,12,2,,,,,,,,,
3681,Cartman,1,"Hahaha, now say ""Caroline, don't go into the light!""",11,Southpark,52,9,,,,,,,,,
3683,Cartman,1,"Haaha, hahahahahaha! Oh man, that is hysterical!  Oh!",11,Southpark,53,8,,,,,,,,,
3685,Stan,1,What was his point?,11,Southpark,19,4,,,,,,,,,
3686,Kyle,1,I have no idea.,11,Southpark,15,4,,,,,,,,,
3687,Stan,1,"Dude, I don't get it.",11,Southpark,21,5,,,,,,,,,
3688,Kyle,1,I don't get it either.,11,Southpark,22,5,,,,,,,,,
3689,Stan,1,Wait a minute. That's it! I don't get it.,11,Southpark,41,9,,,,,,,,,
3690,Kyle,1,...Huh?,11,Southpark,7,1,,,,,,,,,
3691,Stan,1,"Don't you see, Kyle? I don't get it!  Token, I get it now. I don't get it. I've been trying to say that I understand how you feel, but, I'll never understand. I'll never really get how it feels for a black person to have somebody use the N word. I don't get it.",11,Southpark,261,54,,,,,,,,,
3693,Stan,1,Yeah. I totally don't get it.,11,Southpark,29,6,,,,,,,,,
3695,Cartman,2,"This picture I like to call ""The Pierre"". I invited Butters to stay the night, and while he was sleeping I made a mustache on his face with cat poo. Hahahahaha.  And this time, when Butters stayed the night, I put a tampon in his mouth.  I call this picture ""The Sleeping Menstrual"".  This one, I call ""Hot Fudge Mondae"".  I really like how the light plays with the background on this one.",11,Southpark,389,73,,,,,,,,,
3696,Kyle,2,Is this all you brought us here to see?,11,Southpark,39,9,,,,,,,,,
3697,Cartman,2,"Oh no, there's much more.  Let's see- Oh yes, look at this one: I call it ""New Moon Rising"".  I did a whole study using my ass.  Here it is using some high-contrast stuff.  trying out some... different light filters here.  But this is nothing compared to what I have planned. Because tonight... is going to be my coop de grass.",11,Southpark,327,61,,,,,,,,,
3698,Kyle,2,Butters is staying over tonight?,11,Southpark,32,5,,,,,,,,,
3699,Cartman,2,"Yes. And tonight, while Butters is asleep, I am going to-",11,Southpark,57,11,,,,,,,,,
3700,Butters,2,"Hey, fellas! ",11,Southpark,13,2,,,,,,,,,
3701,Cartman,2,"Heh!  Oh, oh hey, Butters!  I wasn't expecting you so soon.",11,Southpark,59,11,,,,,,,,,
3702,Butters,2,Yeah.  I finished my chores so I came over a little early.  Hey! Are you guys all sleepin' over too?,11,Southpark,100,20,,,,,,,,,
3703,Cartman,2,"No no, these guys were just leaving.  weren't you guys?",11,Southpark,55,10,,,,,,,,,
3704,Stan,2,"Come on, let's go. ",11,Southpark,19,4,,,,,,,,,
3705,Kyle,2,"Wait, wai- I can't let this happen.  Butters.",11,Southpark,45,8,,,,,,,,,
3706,Butters,2,Yeah Kyle?,11,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,
3707,Kyle,2,Don't you think it's a little strange that Cartman keeps asking you to stay over?,11,Southpark,81,15,,,,,,,,,
3708,Cartman,2,Kyyyle!,11,Southpark,7,1,,,,,,,,,
3709,Butters,2,Uh what do you mean?,11,Southpark,20,5,,,,,,,,,
3710,Kyle,2,"I mean, that if-",11,Southpark,16,4,,,,,,,,,
3711,Cartman,2,"What he means is that he's jealous that you've taken his place as my new best friend! But grow up, Kyle! Change is a part of life.",11,Southpark,130,27,,,,,,,,,
3712,Butters,2,"Heh yeah, grow up, Kyle.",11,Southpark,24,5,,,,,,,,,
3713,Kyle,2,Hrrugh! ,11,Southpark,8,1,,,,,,,,,
3714,Butters,2,"So what do you wanna do first, Eric? You wanna play a game or just chitchat for a while?",11,Southpark,88,19,,,,,,,,,
3715,Cartman,2,"Well actually, Butters, I think we'd better hit the hay pretty soon.",11,Southpark,68,12,,,,,,,,,
3716,Butters,2,"But, uh-ih-it's only 6:30.",11,Southpark,26,4,,,,,,,,,
3717,Cartman,2,"Yeah, and I'm exhausted. If you are not sleepy yet, I have some more of that nighttime cold medicine you can drink.",11,Southpark,115,22,,,,,,,,,
3718,Cartman,2,You guys! I got it!  It seriously! It's the greatest picture ever! Oh my God!,11,Southpark,77,15,,,,,,,,,
3719,Stan,2,What'cha do to Butters this time?,11,Southpark,33,6,,,,,,,,,
3720,Cartman,2,"It was genius! I waited 'til he was totally asleep, right? And then I got my camera, and I pulled down his pants, and then I took a picture of his wiener in my mouth! ",11,Southpark,167,35,,,,,,,,,
3721,Kyle,2,Dude!,11,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
3722,Cartman,2,"I know I know, check it out, look.  I got his whole wiener in my mouth, see? Heheh. Oh man, I got him good!",11,Southpark,107,24,,,,,,,,,
3723,Stan,2,"Dude, how is putting Butters' wiener in his mouth getting him?",11,Southpark,62,11,,,,,,,,,
3724,Cartman,2,Because that makes Butters gay now!,11,Southpark,35,6,,,,,,,,,
3725,Kyle,2,"No dude, that makes you gay!",11,Southpark,28,6,,,,,,,,,
3726,Cartman,2,Eh- ...what?,11,Southpark,12,2,,,,,,,,,
3727,Kyle,2,"You put a guy's wiener in your mouth, that makes you gay, stupid!",11,Southpark,65,13,,,,,,,,,
3728,Cartman,2,Nuh uh.,11,Southpark,7,2,,,,,,,,,
3729,Kyle,2,Yeah huh!,11,Southpark,9,2,,,,,,,,,
3730,Cartman,2,"Kenny, that doesn't make me gay, huh?",11,Southpark,37,7,,,,,,,,,
3731,Kenny,2,,11,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
3732,Cartman,2,"But I'm not g-I'm not gay, you guys!",11,Southpark,36,8,,,,,,,,,
3733,Stan,2,You are now.,11,Southpark,12,3,,,,,,,,,
3734,Cartman,2,"No, no, it was a stupid mistake!",11,Southpark,32,7,,,,,,,,,
3735,Kyle,2,Doesn't matter. You're gay now.,11,Southpark,31,5,,,,,,,,,
3736,Cartman,2,"No, it was just for a second!  What, what can I do? How how can I reverse this?",11,Southpark,79,18,,,,,,,,,
3737,Stan,2,You can't!,11,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,
3738,Kyle,2,"Nono wait. I I know how you can reverse it, Cartman.",11,Southpark,52,11,,,,,,,,,
3739,Cartman,2,How?,11,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
3740,Kyle,2,The only way you can cancel it out is to get Butters to put your wiener in his mouth.,11,Southpark,85,19,,,,,,,,,
3741,Cartman,2,Really?,11,Southpark,7,1,,,,,,,,,
3742,Kyle,2,Yeah. Then it cancels out the gay polarity.,11,Southpark,43,8,,,,,,,,,
3743,Cartman,2,"...Shit, I gotta find Butters! ",11,Southpark,31,5,,,,,,,,,
3744,Kyle,2,...Idiot.,11,Southpark,9,1,,,,,,,,,
3745,Butters,2,"Help me, I thinking I'm falling in love with you... ",11,Southpark,52,10,,,,,,,,,
3746,Cartman,2,Butters.,11,Southpark,8,1,,,,,,,,,
3747,Butters,2,"Whoa, hey Eric.",11,Southpark,15,3,,,,,,,,,
3748,Cartman,2,"Butters, guess what? I have a surprise for you.",11,Southpark,47,9,,,,,,,,,
3749,Butters,2,A surprise? What is it?,11,Southpark,23,5,,,,,,,,,

3755,Butters,2,"Oh, okay! ",11,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,
3756,Cartman,2,Hang on a second here. ,11,Southpark,23,5,,,,,,,,,
3757,Butters,2,"How come uh, I can't see?",11,Southpark,25,6,,,,,,,,,

3761,Butters,2,"Hey. Hey wait a minute. This ain't a trick, is it? Why you're not gonna, eh stick something icky in my mouth, are ya?",11,Southpark,117,24,,,,,,,,,

3789,Cartman,2,Haahaahahaha!  Very funny! I suppose you really think you got me!,11,Southpark,65,11,,,,,,,,,
3790,Kyle,2,"What are you talking about, fatass?",11,Southpark,35,6,,,,,,,,,
3791,Cartman,2,"I checked on the Internet, Kyyyle, and getting Butters to put my wiener in his mouth wouldn't make me not gay like you said!",11,Southpark,124,24,,,,,,,,,
3792,Kyle,2,"You figured that out, huh?",11,Southpark,26,5,,,,,,,,,
3793,Cartman,2,"That's right. And I also learned from the Internet that just because I put Butters' wiener in my mouth doesn't mean I'm gay! All I have to do is throw away the picture, forget it ever happened, and nobody will ever know. ",11,Southpark,221,42,,,,,,,,,
3794,Kyle,2,Except for us.,11,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,
3795,Cartman,2,"Right, except for you.",11,Southpark,22,4,,,,,,,,,
3796,Kyle,2,And all the people we tell.,11,Southpark,27,6,,,,,,,,,
3797,Cartman,2,Why would you tell anybody?,11,Southpark,27,5,,,,,,,,,
3798,Stan,2,"Because it's really, really funny.",11,Southpark,34,5,,,,,,,,,
3799,Cartman,2,"...It's not that funny. There's lots, there's lots of things that are way funnier.",11,Southpark,82,14,,,,,,,,,
3800,Kyle,2,Like what?,11,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,
3801,Cartman,2,"Liiike... a tampon... in the school cafeteria... in, in somebody's lunch.  Liiike, a, a dog crap... on, on a guy's face! ",11,Southpark,121,21,,,,,,,,,
3802,Stan,2,That isn't funny.,11,Southpark,17,3,,,,,,,,,
3803,Cartman,2,"Yes it is! Now you guys, I'm getting pissed off! You'd better not tell anybody!",11,Southpark,79,15,,,,,,,,,
3804,Kyle,2,"Well, maybe we will, maybe we won't.",11,Southpark,36,7,,,,,,,,,
3805,Cartman,2,"Fine! Whatever! You guys don't have any proof I put Butters' wiener in my mouth! It will be your word against mine! And we all know that everyone trusts me way more than you guys!  You guys, please don't tell anybody.",11,Southpark,217,41,,,,,,,,,
3806,Kyle,2,"Okay. We won't tell anybody as long as you are super nice to us, every day, from now on.",11,Southpark,88,19,,,,,,,,,
3807,Cartman,2,"Oh right, like that's possible! Alright, fine! You know what I'm gonna do, Kyle?! I'm gonna go home, and photo shop the picture so that it is your face with Butters' wiener in his mouth here! And if ANY of you say anything to anybody, I'll simply show them the picture of Kyle.  Haha, hahahaha! ",11,Southpark,295,55,,,,,,,,,
3813,Butters,2,Because I'm bi-curious?,11,Southpark,23,3,,,,,,,,,
3817,Butters,2,I'm bi-curious.,11,Southpark,15,2,,,,,,,,,

3823,Cartman,2,"Where is it, you filthy Jew?!",11,Southpark,29,6,,,,,,,,,
3824,Kyle,2,Where's what?,11,Southpark,13,2,,,,,,,,,
3825,Cartman,2,You know God damned well what!,11,Southpark,30,6,,,,,,,,,
3826,Kyle,2,Let go of me.,11,Southpark,13,4,,,,,,,,,
3827,Stan,2,"What the hell are you doing, Cartman?!",11,Southpark,38,7,,,,,,,,,
3828,Cartman,2,"I went home to alter the picture of me with Butters' penis in my mouth to look like Kyle, but it was gone!  What did you do with my picture?!",11,Southpark,141,30,,,,,,,,,
3829,Kyle,2,Knock it off! I don't have your stupid picture!,11,Southpark,47,9,,,,,,,,,
3830,Cartman,2,"Give it back, Kyle!",11,Southpark,19,4,,,,,,,,,

3832,Cartman,2,"I swear to God, Kyle, if you don't give it back right now,  I'm gonna break your fuckin' Jew legs right here!",11,Southpark,109,22,,,,,,,,,
3833,Kyle,2,Shut up!,11,Southpark,8,2,,,,,,,,,
3834,Cartman,2,"You shut up! You're lying, and  you two are covering up for him! You know what? You're just like Jews yourselves! Stan, you're a Jew, and Kenny, you're a Jew! You're all Jews!  OW!  OW! AAAAUH!  NYAAAAAAAAAA!",11,Southpark,208,37,,,,,,,,,
3837,Butters,2,He's bi-curious too?,11,Southpark,20,3,,,,,,,,,
3842,Cartman,2,Yes. A photograph. And I know who took it! His name is Kyle Broflovski!,11,Southpark,71,14,,,,,,,,,
3844,Cartman,2,"It's a big deal, okay?! That picture is my propertih, and I want it back!",11,Southpark,73,15,,,,,,,,,
3846,Cartman,2,Why... why does that matter?,11,Southpark,28,5,,,,,,,,,
3848,Cartman,2,All right. It's a picture ...of me.,11,Southpark,35,7,,,,,,,,,
3850,Cartman,2,It's a picture ...of me.  And um... what appears to be... a penis... in my mouth.,11,Southpark,81,16,,,,,,,,,
3852,Cartman,2,"No, no I was not! I was asleep, and this person just... puts a penis in my mouth without me knowing! And and took the picture!",11,Southpark,126,26,,,,,,,,,
3854,Cartman,2,"Yes. Now it may appear in the picture... that I'm actually looking at the camera lens and s-and smiling, with the penis in my mouth. And giving a thumbs up. But I assure you, I was fast asleep!",11,Southpark,193,38,,,,,,,,,
3856,Cartman,2,I don't have time for that! We have school tomorrow! And I know that Kyle is gonna show the picture to everybody during Show and Tell!,11,Southpark,134,26,,,,,,,,,
3859,Butters,2,"Well sure, I guess.",11,Southpark,19,4,,,,,,,,,
3862,Butters,2,"Well yeah, sure.",11,Southpark,16,3,,,,,,,,,
3867,Butters,2,Ah I don't understand. What's wrong with underwear?,11,Southpark,51,8,,,,,,,,,
3869,Butters,2,"Yes, it's all very confusing!",11,Southpark,29,5,,,,,,,,,
3871,Cartman,2,That son of a bitch. He's gonna show everyone that picture. Only twelve hours from now.  That's it. I don't have a choice. I'm gonna have to bring Mom in on this one! I'm just... going to have to tell her the truth.  Ow. OW. OW!,11,Southpark,228,46,,,,,,,,,
3873,Cartman,2,"I, don't, want to go to school tomorrow.",11,Southpark,40,8,,,,,,,,,
3875,Cartman,2,"Kyle, has a picture of me, and he's gonna show everyone during Show and Tell, and, everyone's gonna laugh at meeee.",11,Southpark,115,21,,,,,,,,,
3877,Cartman,2,"Because, he's jealous of how much smarter I am than him. So, he's gonna show everyone the picturrrre.",11,Southpark,101,18,,,,,,,,,
3879,Cartman,2,"Last time, when Butters spent the night, I was being really nice to him and I was... gonna take a picture of him for his mom to have.",11,Southpark,133,28,,,,,,,,,
3881,Cartman,2,"But then, right when I took the picture, Butters got really hot, so he pulled his pajama bottoms down, and then I tripped, and, fell down, and my mouth landed right on his penis, and, then I thought of something funny, so I smiled up at, the camera and gave like a, thumbs up, and, and then Kyle took the picture from me, and he's gonna show it to everybody, and make them think I'm gaaaaaaay. ",11,Southpark,394,76,,,,,,,,,
3883,Cartman,2,"But, Mom, I've been trying to get the picture back, but he won't give it to meee. ",11,Southpark,82,17,,,,,,,,,
3885,Cartman,2,"You, you will?",11,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,
3886,Butters,2,...but that He loved us and sent His Only Son to be the satisfaction of our sins. Neato!,11,Southpark,88,18,,,,,,,,,
3888,Butters,2,"Awww, that's okay, Bradley.",11,Southpark,27,4,,,,,,,,,
3890,Butters,2,"Yeah, well hopefully, when we finish writin' all these verses, we won't be bi-curious no more, and then we can go home!",11,Southpark,119,22,,,,,,,,,
3892,Butters,2,Wuh-what's the matter?,11,Southpark,22,3,,,,,,,,,
3894,Butters,2,"Well I like you too, Bradley.",11,Southpark,29,6,,,,,,,,,

3907,Cartman,2,It is?  Really? Oh Mommy thank you! Thank you! ,11,Southpark,47,9,,,,,,,,,
3909,Cartman,2,What?,11,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
3911,Cartman,2,"Mom, she's lying!",11,Southpark,17,3,,,,,,,,,
3913,Cartman,2,"Mom, you don't know anything about Jews! They lie all the time!",11,Southpark,63,12,,,,,,,,,
3915,Cartman,2,Then that's it. Kyle wins. But he won't win completely! I'm going to print out another copy of that picture and show it to the class myself! I can at least rob Kyle of his final lie,11,Southpark,181,37,,,,,,,,,
3917,Butters,2,"I went looking for 'im, but he runs real fast.",11,Southpark,46,10,,,,,,,,,
3919,Butters,2,"Oh no, my Dad?",11,Southpark,14,4,,,,,,,,,
3921,Butters,2,"Well yeah, but I just don't quite understand what you're fixin'.",11,Southpark,64,11,,,,,,,,,
3931,Cartman,2,"Guess you think today is your big day, huh Kyle? To embarrass me in front of everyone?  Well guess what? I'm not giving you the satisfaction!",11,Southpark,141,26,,,,,,,,,
3933,Kyle,2,"Ow! Quit it, dude!",11,Southpark,18,4,,,,,,,,,
3935,Cartman,2,"HA!  For Show And Tell today, I would like to share with you some very special, very artsy photographs I've taken in pursuit of being a respected photographer.  This first picture I like to call ""Moods of Winter"" , a simple aspen grove shot in high-contrast black and white shows the brittleness of the trunks and reminds one... of death. This picture I took just as the sun was rising and this lonely man was walking to work. A statement about... all of our loneliness, perhaps?",11,Southpark,479,86,,,,,,,,,
3936,Kyle,2,He isn't actually going to show everyone...,11,Southpark,43,7,,,,,,,,,
3937,Cartman,2,And now this next picture ,11,Southpark,26,5,,,,,,,,,
3940,Butters,2,"Bradley, please. You're my accountabilibuddy. How will this make me look?",11,Southpark,73,11,,,,,,,,,
3943,Butters,2,"You're perfectly normal, Bradley.",11,Southpark,33,4,,,,,,,,,
3945,Butters,2,All right. All right that does it!  I am sick and tired of everyone telling me I'm confused! I wasn't confused until other people started tellin' me I was!  You know what I think? I think maybe you are the ones who are confused!,11,Southpark,228,44,,,,,,,,,
3947,Butters,2,"I'm not gonna be confused anymore just because you say I should be! My name is Butters, I'm eight years old, I'm blood type O, and I'm bi-curious! And even that's okay! Because if I'm bi-curious, and I'm somehow made from God, then I think your God must be a little bi-curious himself! ",11,Southpark,286,53,,,,,,,,,
3951,Butters,2,No. I like bein' bi-curious.,11,Southpark,28,5,,,,,,,,,
3953,Butters,2,Wait. Now I am confused.,11,Southpark,24,5,,,,,,,,,
3954,Cartman,2,And this photograph I took of a sunset near the power plant. Note how the contrasting images make a statement about our impact on the Earth. Which brings us to my last picture. Ahem. This picture you may find somewhat... controversial. ,11,Southpark,236,41,,,,,,,,,
3957,Cartman,2,Yes. This is shot at a 5.6 aperture using a low-light filter. You can see the grain from the high-speed film - there's sort of a- penis in my mouth right here - and the low depth of field keeps the background soft.,11,Southpark,214,43,,,,,,,,,
3959,Cartman,2,"What this is, is a statement against the war in Iraq. It's wrong that we still have our troops there. It's wrong! And what I think that-",11,Southpark,136,27,,,,,,,,,
3961,Cartman,2,...Lame.,11,Southpark,8,1,,,,,,,,,
3963,Cartman,3,"Ah yes. You mean the Jew problem.  Good, good! I'm glad we're finally gonna do something about it.",11,Southpark,98,18,,,,,,,,,
3968,Cartman,3,Uh th-that is completely unnecessary. Everyone knows that only poor people can get lice. The only person that can spread it here is Kenny.,11,Southpark,138,24,,,,,,,,,
3969,Kenny,3,,11,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
3979,Butters,3,"Boy, I sure hope they don't find lice in my hair.",11,Southpark,49,11,,,,,,,,,
3980,Stan,3,What do you think happens if you do have it?,11,Southpark,44,10,,,,,,,,,
3981,Cartman,3,"They drag you out of here, put you in this big containment facility, where they stick a cold metal pipe up your ass with this clear jelly, and then they shock your balls. ",11,Southpark,171,33,,,,,,,,,
3983,Cartman,3,This is ridiculous. All this just so they can send Kenny and his stupid head lice home.,11,Southpark,87,17,,,,,,,,,
3984,Kenny,3, ,11,Southpark,1,0,,,,,,,,,
4037,Cartman,3,"Waiwaiwait, whoa whoa, so what happened?",11,Southpark,40,6,,,,,,,,,
4041,Stan,3,Somebody in this class?,11,Southpark,23,4,,,,,,,,,
4044,Cartman,3,"Well who was it?  It was Kenny, right?",11,Southpark,38,8,,,,,,,,,
4046,Cartman,3,"Doesn't matter?! If somebody had parasites in their hair, we need to know who!  It was Kenny, wasn't it?",11,Southpark,104,19,,,,,,,,,
4049,Cartman,3,That is bullcrap! You are denying our rights as children to totally rip on that kid and make him or her feel like an outcast!,11,Southpark,125,25,,,,,,,,,
4053,Butters,3,Yeah! Dumb girls!,11,Southpark,17,3,,,,,,,,,
4065,Cartman,3,"All right, the person who had head lice needs to speak up right now, so that we know to stay away from you! ",11,Southpark,108,23,,,,,,,,,
4067,Cartman,3,"Okay, whoever you are, you are now not only a licehead, you're a liar! You're only making this worse on yourself!",11,Southpark,113,21,,,,,,,,,
4068,Kyle,3,You know what? I'll bet it was you!,11,Southpark,35,8,,,,,,,,,
4069,Cartman,3,Me?!,11,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
4070,Kyle,3,This is exactly what you would do if they found lice in your hair! Try to lead the charge against somebody else to take the suspicion off of yourself!,11,Southpark,150,29,,,,,,,,,
4071,Cartman,3,"I don't think so, Kyle! But you know what?! This is exactly what you would do if you had had head lice! Try to get everyone to blame me!",11,Southpark,136,29,,,,,,,,,
4072,Stan,3,You guys stop it! This isn't getting us anywhere!,11,Southpark,49,9,,,,,,,,,
4073,Cartman,3,"That's exactly what you would do if you had had head lice, Stan. ",11,Southpark,65,13,,,,,,,,,
4074,Kyle,3,"Yeah, try to have everyone make peace so it doesn't seem like a big deal.",11,Southpark,73,15,,,,,,,,,
4075,Cartman,3,And this is exactly what Kenny would do: stand here and say nothing! ,11,Southpark,69,13,,,,,,,,,
4076,Butters,3,"Heh hey guys, what would I do?",11,Southpark,30,7,,,,,,,,,
4078,Kyle,3,It's too late. The treatment would have killed it all.,11,Southpark,54,10,,,,,,,,,
4080,Cartman,3,There's a way! There's a way to find out who had sick-ass head cooties! And I'm gonna find it! ,11,Southpark,95,19,,,,,,,,,
4081,Kyle,3,It was him. It had to have been him!,11,Southpark,36,9,,,,,,,,,
4082,Stan,3,Yeah... Or you. ,11,Southpark,16,3,,,,,,,,,
4100,Cartman,3,"All right, lock that door, Craig! ",11,Southpark,34,6,,,,,,,,,
4101,Kyle,3,"What's this about, Cartman? ",11,Southpark,28,4,,,,,,,,,
4102,Cartman,3,"I've come up with a test that can determine if it was any of us who had the head lice.  We're gonna find out once and for all who had head cooties.  Lice feed on a person's blood, and just like mosquitoes they leave small traces of their saliva in the host's bloodstream. That saliva, is monochromagnic. So if an infected person's blood is touched by... this hot metal coil, say... that person's blood will jump 10 meters into the air.",11,Southpark,435,81,,,,,,,,,
4104,Kyle,3,"That's retarded! You didn't come up with that experiment, Cartman, you saw it in that movie, The Thing!",11,Southpark,103,18,,,,,,,,,
4105,Cartman,3,"This is a scientific test, designed to-",11,Southpark,39,7,,,,,,,,,
4106,Kyle,3,You saw it in The Thing and you're wasting everyone's time!,11,Southpark,59,11,,,,,,,,,
4107,Cartman,3,"I thought you might say that, Kyle. Because you don't want to take the test, do you?!",11,Southpark,85,17,,,,,,,,,
4108,Kyle,3,Nobody's blood is going to jump up in the air!,11,Southpark,46,10,,,,,,,,,
4109,Cartman,3,"If it isn't going to work, then what are you afraid of? The only person who wouldn't want to take the test is somebody who was worried it might work and reveal that they were the ones with lice!",11,Southpark,194,39,,,,,,,,,
4113,Kyle,3,"All right, fine. I'll do the dumb test.",11,Southpark,39,8,,,,,,,,,
4114,Cartman,3,Everyone take a Petri dish and a syringe. We need at least 30 cc's of blood from each one of you.,11,Southpark,97,21,,,,,,,,,
4115,Cartman,3,"All right, now everyone back over there!  We'll start with what I already know. ",11,Southpark,80,14,,,,,,,,,
4116,Butters,3,"Well, guess that proves Eric wasn't the one with head lice.",11,Southpark,59,11,,,,,,,,,
4117,Kyle,3,It doesn't prove anything!,11,Southpark,26,4,,,,,,,,,
4118,Cartman,3,"Yeah? Let's just see what your blood does, Kyle!  Huh, I guess you're clean. ",11,Southpark,77,14,,,,,,,,,
4120,Cartman,3,"It's all right, it won't take much longer, just-AHH AHHGH! ",11,Southpark,59,10,,,,,,,,,
4122,Cartman,3,Kenny!,11,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
4123,Kyle,3,No way.,11,Southpark,7,2,,,,,,,,,
4125,Cartman,3,Of course I was right! I told you only poor people get lice! ,11,Southpark,61,13,,,,,,,,,
4141,Cartman,3,"He lied to us all! He betrayed his kind! We all know what has to happen.  Grab a sock and a bar of soap, and meet us at the park! ",11,Southpark,130,30,,,,,,,,,
4143,Cartman,3,"What, Clyde?",11,Southpark,12,2,,,,,,,,,
4145,Cartman,3,"All right, see you there!  Remember, bar of soap and a sock! Kenny's gonna get it!",11,Southpark,82,16,,,,,,,,,
4163,Cartman,3,"Kenny McCormick, you are charged with bringing head cooties into our school, and lying about it to cover your ass! How do you plead?!",11,Southpark,133,24,,,,,,,,,
4164,Kenny,3,,11,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
4165,Cartman,3,Guilty! I thought so! ,11,Southpark,22,4,,,,,,,,,
4168,Cartman,3,"All right, Kenny. You know what has to happen! Sock bath! Everyone wash Kenny with the soap and dry him off with the socks! ",11,Southpark,124,24,,,,,,,,,
4169,Kenny,3,"Nohoho! No, not the socks! Ahhhgh, stop!",11,Southpark,40,7,,,,,,,,,
4171,Kyle,3,"Wait... stop it, stop it!  I can't let Kenny be sock-dried.",11,Southpark,59,11,,,,,,,,,
4173,Kyle,3,"Kenny didn't have the head lice, all right?!  It was me.",11,Southpark,56,11,,,,,,,,,
4175,Kyle,3,"I was the one. I was too afraid to say anything, but I can't let Kenny be sock-bathed for it.",11,Southpark,93,20,,,,,,,,,
4176,Stan,3,"Why are you saying that, Kyle? You can't be the one who had head lice.  Because I was. You're just trying to make me feel bad because you figured that out, didn't you?!",11,Southpark,168,33,,,,,,,,,
4178,Cartman,3,"Oh I get it.  This is some kind of big trick on me! You've known I was the one with head lice all along, huh?!",11,Southpark,110,25,,,,,,,,,
4179,Stan,3,You had head lice?,11,Southpark,18,4,,,,,,,,,
4180,Cartman,3,Of course! Why do you think I went through that elaborate bullcrap experiment to frame Kenny?!,11,Southpark,94,16,,,,,,,,,
4183,Butters,3,Me too.,11,Southpark,7,2,,,,,,,,,
4184,Cartman,3,But that means... that means Kenny was lying! Sock bath! ,11,Southpark,57,10,,,,,,,,,
4185,Kenny,3,Dudes!,11,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
4192,Cartman,4,Uh oh! ,11,Southpark,7,2,,,,,,,,,
4195,Cartman,4,"Duhude, dude,  not cool!",11,Southpark,24,4,,,,,,,,,
4198,Cartman,4,"Oooh hooohoho. Nooo, noohoohoo.",11,Southpark,31,4,,,,,,,,,
4200,Cartman,4,What's wrong?  Has he been checked for bombs?,11,Southpark,45,8,,,,,,,,,
4202,Cartman,4,"No, but most of them are. And all it takes is most of them.",11,Southpark,59,14,,,,,,,,,
4203,Butters,4,"Now you go, Baahir. ",11,Southpark,20,4,,,,,,,,,
4204,Kyle,4,Yeah?,11,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
4205,Cartman,4,"Kyle, are you on your computer?",11,Southpark,31,6,,,,,,,,,
4206,Kyle,4,"What? No, I'm sick. ",11,Southpark,20,4,,,,,,,,,
4207,Cartman,4,Get online. I need you to check something for me.,11,Southpark,49,10,,,,,,,,,
4208,Kyle,4,"Dude, leave me alone.",11,Southpark,21,4,,,,,,,,,
4209,Cartman,4,"Kyle, every one of our friends might be in serious danger!",11,Southpark,58,11,,,,,,,,,
4210,Kyle,4,What? Why?,11,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,
4211,Cartman,4,Get online now!,11,Southpark,15,3,,,,,,,,,
4212,Kyle,4,"All right, all right. ",11,Southpark,22,4,,,,,,,,,
4213,Cartman,4,Go to MySpace.  See if there's a MySpace page for a Baahir Hakeem.,11,Southpark,66,13,,,,,,,,,
4214,Kyle,4,"Baahir Hakeem.  Born in Chicago, eight years old, his favorite color is green... Car, Cartman, what is this all about?",11,Southpark,118,20,,,,,,,,,
4215,Cartman,4,"Kyle, I want you to check his buddy list. How many MySpace friends does he have?",11,Southpark,80,16,,,,,,,,,
4216,Kyle,4,Over a hundred.,11,Southpark,15,3,,,,,,,,,
4217,Cartman,4,Look further down the page. Does he list his favorite band?,11,Southpark,59,11,,,,,,,,,
4218,Kyle,4,White Stripes,11,Southpark,13,2,,,,,,,,,
4219,Cartman,4,That's funny.,11,Southpark,13,2,,,,,,,,,
4220,Kyle,4,What?,11,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
4221,Cartman,4,He told everyone in class today his favorite band was Blink 182.,11,Southpark,64,12,,,,,,,,,
4222,Cartman,4,The following takes place between Recess and Geography class.,11,Southpark,61,9,,,,,,,,,
4224,Cartman,4,"Officer Barbrady, South Park Elementary is in serious danger! ",11,Southpark,62,9,,,,,,,,,
4226,Cartman,4,I've just ID'd a Muslim and his MySpace page does not check out. You've got to get these people out of here now!,11,Southpark,112,23,,,,,,,,,
4228,Cartman,4,"If I wasn't serious, would I be talking like this?",11,Southpark,50,10,,,,,,,,,
4230,Cartman,4,"Whispering, but whispering really loudly for dramatic effect.",11,Southpark,61,8,,,,,,,,,
4234,Butters,4,"Hey, Baahir, uh since we get to go home, you wanna come over uh, play checkers?",11,Southpark,79,16,,,,,,,,,
4236,Butters,4,Well all right! ,11,Southpark,16,3,,,,,,,,,
4237,Kyle,4,Dude. ,11,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
4238,Cartman,4,Yeah. ,11,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
4239,Kyle,4,"Dude, I just got an IM from Stan that they evacuated the school.",11,Southpark,64,13,,,,,,,,,
4240,Cartman,4,Yeah. Now do you believe me that somethin' is goin' on?!,11,Southpark,56,11,,,,,,,,,
4241,Kyle,4,I guess so.,11,Southpark,11,3,,,,,,,,,
4242,Cartman,4,Yeah well I don't like it! It doesn't follow!,11,Southpark,45,9,,,,,,,,,
4243,Kyle,4,Wuh what doesn't follow?,11,Southpark,24,4,,,,,,,,,
4244,Cartman,4,"Why would a terrorist just blow up a school? It's not their M.O. Unless... Oh my God! Unless this was all just a big diversion.  Kyle, I need you to Google-search the South Park Chamber of Commerce!",11,Southpark,198,37,,,,,,,,,
4245,Kyle,4,Okay.,11,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
4246,Cartman,4,Their Web site should have a calendar of events: is there anything big going on in town today?!,11,Southpark,95,18,,,,,,,,,
4247,Kyle,4,"Yeah. Actually, there is.",11,Southpark,25,4,,,,,,,,,
4248,Cartman,4,What?,11,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
4249,Kyle,4,There's a Hillary Clinton campaign rally.  Cartman? ...Cartman? ,11,Southpark,64,8,,,,,,,,,
4252,Cartman,4,"Mr. Thompson, you have to call off the Clinton rally! There's a terrorist in South Park!",11,Southpark,88,16,,,,,,,,,
4254,Cartman,4,He just showed up out of the blue! I need to speak with the President right away!,11,Southpark,81,17,,,,,,,,,
4256,Cartman,4,I said I will only talk to the President!,11,Southpark,41,9,,,,,,,,,
4258,Cartman,4,LALALALALALALALA!,11,Southpark,17,1,,,,,,,,,
4260,Cartman,4,LALALA-I can't hear you! Only the President! LALALALALALA!,11,Southpark,58,8,,,,,,,,,
4263,Cartman,4,"President Bush, this is Eric Cartman! Are we on a secure line?",11,Southpark,62,12,,,,,,,,,
4265,Cartman,4,"Look, I know you're not the biggest Hildog fan, but she is in great danger right now!",11,Southpark,85,17,,,,,,,,,
4284,Cartman,4,"Kyle, I'm at the Clinton rally site, but there's no sign of that kid!",11,Southpark,69,14,,,,,,,,,
4285,Kyle,4,So then maybe you're wrong.,11,Southpark,27,5,,,,,,,,,
4286,Cartman,4,"Nope, I'm not wrong. He must be somehow attacking remotely from his house. Did you find the address?",11,Southpark,100,18,,,,,,,,,
4287,Kyle,4,Yeah. I cross-referenced his MySpace page with realtor.com. His parents moved into that green house on Janice Street.,11,Southpark,117,18,,,,,,,,,
4288,Cartman,4,"Jesus, that's on the other side of town. All right, Kyle, I'm going to take a picture with my camera phone and upload it to you. You ready?",11,Southpark,139,28,,,,,,,,,
4289,Kyle,4,Yeah.  What is that?,11,Southpark,20,4,,,,,,,,,
4290,Cartman,4,It's my balls! ,11,Southpark,15,3,,,,,,,,,
4291,Kyle,4,God damn it Cartman!,11,Southpark,20,4,,,,,,,,,
4292,Cartman,4,"Okay. Okay, Kyle, let's stay focused here.",11,Southpark,42,7,,,,,,,,,
4328,Cartman,4,Yeah? ,11,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
4330,Cartman,4,"Yes, Mr. Thompson?",11,Southpark,18,3,,,,,,,,,
4332,Cartman,4,Why? Did you find something?,11,Southpark,28,5,,,,,,,,,
4334,Cartman,4,A snuke?,11,Southpark,8,2,,,,,,,,,
4336,Cartman,4,I have the address of the house the terrorist moved into. I'm almost there now; where are you?,11,Southpark,94,18,,,,,,,,,
4338,Cartman,4,"Oh dude, I'm, I'm right next to you. ",11,Southpark,37,8,,,,,,,,,
4340,Stan,4,"Dude, we totally got let out of school.",11,Southpark,39,8,,,,,,,,,
4341,Kyle,4,"I know. Something big is going on. Take a look at this. I did a Google search for ""Hillary Clinton Campaign Rally"" right? And one of the links was to YouTube, where this Russian guy had a bunch of videos.",11,Southpark,204,40,,,,,,,,,
4342,Stan,4,Russian?,11,Southpark,8,1,,,,,,,,,
4343,Kyle,4,"Yeah, this guy.  Vladimir Stolfsky. He had videos on YouTube of every single rally.",11,Southpark,83,14,,,,,,,,,
4344,Stan,4,So he's a Hillary Clinton fan.,11,Southpark,30,6,,,,,,,,,
4345,Kyle,4,"No. I cross-referenced his YouTube profile with MySpace, and according to his blog, he's an old-school Communist. So what's he doing at every Clinton rally?",11,Southpark,156,25,,,,,,,,,
4346,Stan,4,Do a WebCrawler search: maybe he has podcasts up somewhere.,11,Southpark,59,10,,,,,,,,,
4347,Kyle,4,Oh that's a good idea. ,11,Southpark,23,5,,,,,,,,,
4350,Cartman,4,Big surprise!,11,Southpark,13,2,,,,,,,,,
4364,Cartman,4,Let me have time with him.,11,Southpark,26,6,,,,,,,,,
4366,Cartman,4,We have to find that detonator! Let me have time with him!  You will tell me where your son is!,11,Southpark,95,20,,,,,,,,,
4368,Cartman,4,Where is the detonator?!,11,Southpark,24,4,,,,,,,,,
4370,Cartman,4,I can do this aaall day.,11,Southpark,24,6,,,,,,,,,
4372,Cartman,4,You can make it stop!,11,Southpark,21,5,,,,,,,,,
4375,Kyle,4,"Okay, I got a text of the Russian guy's podcast. It's all a bunch of links to eBay.",11,Southpark,83,18,,,,,,,,,
4376,Stan,4,You should be able to search his username on eBay and see what he's been buying and selling. ,11,Southpark,93,18,,,,,,,,,
4378,Kyle,4,Hey.,11,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
4380,Kyle,4,What's going on?,11,Southpark,16,3,,,,,,,,,
4382,Kyle,4,...Homeland Security?,11,Southpark,21,2,,,,,,,,,
4393,Cartman,4,Nothing... if you tell me where your son is!,11,Southpark,44,9,,,,,,,,,
4395,Cartman,4,Do you know what this is?!  This... is apple juice. It gives super bad farts. ,11,Southpark,78,15,,,,,,,,,
4397,Cartman,4,Where is your son?!,11,Southpark,19,4,,,,,,,,,
4401,Cartman,4,Answer it! ,11,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
4403,Cartman,4,Butters.,11,Southpark,8,1,,,,,,,,,
4406,Cartman,4,We got him! I know where he is!,11,Southpark,31,8,,,,,,,,,
4408,Cartman,4,"No no, he's my lead. ",11,Southpark,21,5,,,,,,,,,
4410,Cartman,4,You blow in there and you risk taking him down without finding the detonator! I'm going to find out where it is! ,11,Southpark,113,22,,,,,,,,,
4412,Kyle,4,Ask Jeeves? Nobody uses Ask Jeeves! Just Google-search it!,11,Southpark,58,9,,,,,,,,,
4414,Kyle,4,Yes. There's a Russian guy named Vladimir Stolfsky who's got search engine hits all over this thing.,11,Southpark,100,17,,,,,,,,,
4417,Stan,4,"Look, these Russian guys all have blogs talking about this like it's just some big diversion for something much bigger!",11,Southpark,119,20,,,,,,,,,
4421,Kyle,4,"Look, we already have the guy's blog. Maybe we can find an address and check it out on MapQuest.",11,Southpark,96,19,,,,,,,,,
4423,Kyle,4,...Not anymore you're not.,11,Southpark,26,4,,,,,,,,,
4425,Butters,4,"Whoopee! I captured another one of your pieces, Baahir. ",11,Southpark,56,9,,,,,,,,,
4426,Cartman,4,Uuugh! ,11,Southpark,7,1,,,,,,,,,
4427,Butters,4,Oh hey Eric.,11,Southpark,12,3,,,,,,,,,
4428,Cartman,4,Where is the detonator!,11,Southpark,23,4,,,,,,,,,
4430,Cartman,4,You have exactly five seconds before I start dropping serious apple juice farts on your face! One!,11,Southpark,98,17,,,,,,,,,
4432,Butters,4,"Hey, I was about to win!",11,Southpark,24,6,,,,,,,,,
4433,Cartman,4,"Stop, terrorist, or I will shoot you! ",11,Southpark,38,7,,,,,,,,,
4435,Cartman,4,"Uh, that's cool. I'm actually not... playing anymore.",11,Southpark,53,8,,,,,,,,,
4440,Cartman,4,Let me go! Please! I am just a little boy!,11,Southpark,42,10,,,,,,,,,
4442,Cartman,4,That's cool. I'm fine with Muslims invading.,11,Southpark,44,7,,,,,,,,,
4444,Cartman,4,"Uhh yes, of course?",11,Southpark,19,4,,,,,,,,,
4446,Cartman,4,The Russians?,11,Southpark,13,2,,,,,,,,,
4448,Cartman,4,The Germans?,11,Southpark,12,2,,,,,,,,,
4450,Cartman,4,The Germans again?,11,Southpark,18,3,,,,,,,,,
4452,Cartman,4,You can't possible mean...?,11,Southpark,27,4,,,,,,,,,
4472,Kyle,4,"I got it! I got it! According to PayPal, the Russian guys are just hired mercenaries who had ads up on Craig's List and got paid through eBay so that Boston could be attacked by... the British.",11,Southpark,193,37,,,,,,,,,
4476,Kyle,4,All right! MapQuest the address!,11,Southpark,32,5,,,,,,,,,
4478,Kyle,4,Good thinking,11,Southpark,13,2,,,,,,,,,
4501,Kyle,4,"Yeah. It just proves we need to learn not to profile one race of people. Because, actually, most of the world hates us.",11,Southpark,119,23,,,,,,,,,
4502,Cartman,4,"Well Baahir, I was thinking that maybe I owe you an apology.",11,Southpark,60,12,,,,,,,,,
4504,Cartman,4,"Yes, but then I realized that, technically, I don't. Because by being suspicious of you I saved your life and everyone else's. So really, you owe me an apology. But that's cool.",11,Southpark,177,32,,,,,,,,,
4505,Kyle,4,"...You didn't save everyone, I did! You were just out harassing Muslims!",11,Southpark,72,12,,,,,,,,,
4506,Cartman,4,"But if I hadn't called you in the first place to check out the Muslim, you would have just stayed in bed sick all day, right?",11,Southpark,125,26,,,,,,,,,
4507,Kyle,4,...Maybe. ,11,Southpark,10,1,,,,,,,,,
4508,Cartman,4,"Maybe? If I hadn't called you, you wouldn't have been on your computer checking out the Clinton rally. That means my intolerance of Muslims saved America.",11,Southpark,154,26,,,,,,,,,
4509,Kyle,4,...That is so missing the point.,11,Southpark,32,6,,,,,,,,,
4510,Cartman,4,"Me being a bigot stopped a nuclear bomb from going off, yes or no?!",11,Southpark,67,14,,,,,,,,,
4511,Kyle,4,"The-that's not the right way to look at it, I-",11,Southpark,46,10,,,,,,,,,
4512,Cartman,4,"Yes or no, Kyle?!",11,Southpark,17,4,,,,,,,,,
4513,Kyle,4,No! ...Not... not like you're saying.,11,Southpark,37,6,,,,,,,,,
4514,Cartman,4,"But that's all I'm saying: today, bigotry and racism saved the day. Baahir, you get this, right? ",11,Southpark,97,17,,,,,,,,,
4516,Butters,4,Awwwww.,11,Southpark,7,1,,,,,,,,,
4517,Cartman,4,"Okay. Who got rid of the Muslims, huh?  That was all me. Simple thank you will suffice.",11,Southpark,87,17,,,,,,,,,
4518,Randy,5,"...In my Easter Bonnet, with all the frills upon it, I'll be the grandest lady in the Easter parade.",11,Southpark,100,19,,,,,,,,,
4519,Randy,5,"Look at that one, huh? Half purple and half yellow with a chikadee sticker. I'm good. ",11,Southpark,86,16,,,,,,,,,
4520,Stan,5,"Uh, can I ask a question? Why do we do this?",11,Southpark,44,11,,,,,,,,,
4521,Randy,5,"Wha... what do you mean, ""Why do we do this?"" It's Easter!",11,Southpark,58,12,,,,,,,,,
4522,Stan,5,"Right, so, why do we color eggs? ",11,Southpark,33,7,,,,,,,,,
4523,Randy,5,"Wulll, ssso that the Easter bunny can hide them.",11,Southpark,48,9,,,,,,,,,
4524,Stan,5,"Yeah, but why?",11,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,
4525,Randy,5,"Stanley, Easter celebrates the day that Jesus was resurrected after being crucified for our sins.",11,Southpark,97,15,,,,,,,,,
4526,Stan,5,So we dip eggs in colored vinegar and a giant rabbit hides them?,11,Southpark,64,13,,,,,,,,,
4527,Randy,5,That's right.,11,Southpark,13,2,,,,,,,,,
4528,Stan,5,"You don't see the missteps in logic with that?  Look, I'm just saying that somewhere between Jesus dying on the Cross and a giant bunny hiding eggs there seems to be a, a gap of information.",11,Southpark,190,36,,,,,,,,,
4529,Randy,5,"Stanley, just dye your Goddamned eggs!",11,Southpark,38,6,,,,,,,,,
4530,Stan,5,I don't feel like coloring eggs! I don't get it!,11,Southpark,48,10,,,,,,,,,
4531,Randy,5,What is wrong with him?!,11,Southpark,24,5,,,,,,,,,
4533,Randy,5,You know so little! ,11,Southpark,20,4,,,,,,,,,
4534,Cartman,5,"And I want a Baltor soldier doll for Easter, and five Crash'n'Go RC cars, you got that?! Do you have that?!",11,Southpark,107,21,,,,,,,,,
4536,Cartman,5,"Nono! You don't ask me questions! You are a rabbit! I am a human. So if you don't bring me what I want for Easter, I can fucking kill you!",11,Southpark,138,30,,,,,,,,,
4538,Cartman,5,"Bye, Easter bunny! ",11,Southpark,19,3,,,,,,,,,
4540,Stan,5,"All right, can you explain to me what's going on?",11,Southpark,49,10,,,,,,,,,
4542,Stan,5,What is the deal with the coloring the eggs and you hiding them and all that? What does that have to do with Jesus dying on the Cross?  It is symbolic? Are you trying to reference something that happened in Biblical times?  Answer me!,11,Southpark,234,44,,,,,,,,,
4544,Stan,5,I know that! But I figure you must have some knowledge of what Easter's about if you're playing the Easter Bunny at the mall!,11,Southpark,125,24,,,,,,,,,
4546,Stan,5,"No, I'm not gonna just go with it! I'm gonna find out what's behind all this! ",11,Southpark,78,16,,,,,,,,,
4548,Stan,5,Mom? Dad?  Anybody home?,11,Southpark,24,4,,,,,,,,,
4549,Randy,5,"Not now, Stanley, I'm on the toilet! ",11,Southpark,37,7,,,,,,,,,
4550,Stan,5,Dad! You've gotta help me! ,11,Southpark,27,5,,,,,,,,,
4551,Randy,5,"Hang on, I'm taking a crap.",11,Southpark,27,6,,,,,,,,,
4552,Stan,5,Dad! There's Easter bunnies chasing me!,11,Southpark,39,6,,,,,,,,,
4553,Randy,5,What?,11,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
4554,Stan,5,"They chased me from the mall! I don't know what they want!  They're coming in! Dad, open the door!  Dad?",11,Southpark,104,20,,,,,,,,,
4555,Randy,5,"We... need to talk, Stan.  Ih, it's okay guys.",11,Southpark,46,9,,,,,,,,,
4557,Randy,5,Yeah. 'Cause it turns out the kid we're after is my son.,11,Southpark,56,12,,,,,,,,,
4559,Randy,5,Tell the Grand Hare everything is okay. I'll take it from here.,11,Southpark,63,12,,,,,,,,,
4560,Randy,5,"I wanted to keep this from you, Stan. I really wanted to wait until you were older but... you just had to keep asking questions!",11,Southpark,128,25,,,,,,,,,
4561,Stan,5,Why were those other rabbit guys chasing me?!,11,Southpark,45,8,,,,,,,,,
4562,Randy,5,"We have to be careful when we think somebody's onto us.  We are all part of a secret society, Stan. A very ancient, very important society of men who follow the way of the Rabbit, and protect the secret of the Easter bunny. We are called... the Hare Club For Men.",11,Southpark,263,51,,,,,,,,,
4563,Stan,5,Does Mom know about this?,11,Southpark,25,5,,,,,,,,,
4564,Randy,5,"Duh, it's the Hare Club For Men. Chicks wouldn't understand.",11,Southpark,60,10,,,,,,,,,
4565,Stan,5,I don't understand!,11,Southpark,19,3,,,,,,,,,
4566,Randy,5,I belong to a secret society that has been around for thousands of years! Our identities have to be protected!,11,Southpark,110,20,,,,,,,,,
4567,Stan,5,"Could, could you, take off, the ears, please?",11,Southpark,45,8,,,,,,,,,
4568,Randy,5,"Stan, you don't seem to understand how serious this is! The secret of Easter that we protect is something that could rock the foundation of the entire world!",11,Southpark,157,28,,,,,,,,,
4569,Stan,5,So what is the secret of Easter?,11,Southpark,32,7,,,,,,,,,
4570,Randy,5,"I can't tell you. You have to be allowed into the Society first, but... but perhaps... it's time.",11,Southpark,97,18,,,,,,,,,
4571,Randy,5,"I always knew this day would come, when my son would be brought into the society. Reminds me of the day I was brought in by my father.",11,Southpark,134,28,,,,,,,,,
4572,Stan,5,Grandpa's in it too?,11,Southpark,20,4,,,,,,,,,
4573,Randy,5,Of course. Marshes have been in the Hare Club For Men for generations. All the way back to the beginning.,11,Southpark,105,20,,,,,,,,,
4574,Stan,5,"Dad, do I have to wear this bag over my head the entire time?",11,Southpark,61,14,,,,,,,,,
4575,Randy,5,"You aren't a member yet. You can't know where our secret meetings take place. We're going to a distant location, an old building near a lake about 40 minutes away.",11,Southpark,163,30,,,,,,,,,
4576,Stan,5,You mean the old Galveston Lodge? ,11,Southpark,34,6,,,,,,,,,
4577,Randy,5,Dammit.,11,Southpark,7,1,,,,,,,,,
4583,Stan,5,Must I?,11,Southpark,7,2,,,,,,,,,
4585,Stan,5,Hi Grandpa.,11,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
4587,Stan,5,...Stan.,11,Southpark,8,1,,,,,,,,,
4593,Stan,5,Yeah.,11,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
4594,Randy,5,"Are you sure, son? Once you hear the secret, you will be bound to The Hare Club For Men forever.",11,Southpark,96,20,,,,,,,,,
4595,Stan,5,"Yeah, I wanna know already.",11,Southpark,27,5,,,,,,,,,
4600,Randy,5,"Come on, we've gotta go!  Stan, take Snowball and get out of here!",11,Southpark,66,13,,,,,,,,,
4601,Stan,5,Where am I supposed to go?,11,Southpark,26,6,,,,,,,,,
4602,Randy,5,Just get out of here! ,11,Southpark,22,5,,,,,,,,,
4606,Stan,5,Jesus Christ! ,11,Southpark,14,2,,,,,,,,,
4608,Stan,5,Oh no... ,11,Southpark,9,2,,,,,,,,,
4609,Stan,5,Help.,11,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
4610,Kyle,5,What happened?,11,Southpark,14,2,,,,,,,,,
4611,Stan,5,My Dad's in a rabbit-worshiping cult called the Hare Club For Men they protect the secret of Easter but before they said what it was they were attacked by ninjas and put me in charge of Snowball.,11,Southpark,195,37,,,,,,,,,
4612,Kyle,5,...I'm kind of finger painting right now.,11,Southpark,41,7,,,,,,,,,
4613,Stan,5,"Dude, they took my Dad away. They even shot one of his fellow hares. And now they're after me!  Do you know anything about Easter? What is the connection between Jesus and rabbits and colored eggs?",11,Southpark,197,36,,,,,,,,,
4614,Kyle,5,"Dude, I'm Jewish. I have no idea.",11,Southpark,33,7,,,,,,,,,
4615,Randy,5,"Nelson.  Nelson? Nelson, say something.",11,Southpark,39,5,,,,,,,,,
4617,Randy,5,"Nelson, do you know where we are? Where did they take us?",11,Southpark,57,12,,,,,,,,,
4619,Randy,5,You...,11,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
4620,Kyle,5,"Hi, we'd like to speak to a  Professor Teabag? ",11,Southpark,47,9,,,,,,,,,
4622,Kyle,5,The history of Easter.,11,Southpark,22,4,,,,,,,,,
4624,Stan,5,Please? Do you know anything about the Hare Club For Men? ,11,Southpark,58,11,,,,,,,,,
4626,Stan,5,My Dad is in it. This... rabbit is too somehow.,11,Southpark,47,10,,,,,,,,,
4629,Stan,5,Just bread...,11,Southpark,13,2,,,,,,,,,
4631,Kyle,5,It kind of looks like... an egg.,11,Southpark,32,7,,,,,,,,,
4633,Kyle,5,Who is Saint Peter?,11,Southpark,19,4,,,,,,,,,
4634,Stan,5,He was the disciple that Jesus made into the first pope.,11,Southpark,56,11,,,,,,,,,
4636,Kyle,5,Peter Rabbit.,11,Southpark,13,2,,,,,,,,,
4638,Kyle,5,I don't see it.,11,Southpark,15,4,,,,,,,,,
4640,Stan,5,He looks like a guy.,11,Southpark,20,5,,,,,,,,,
4642,Kyle,5,I don't believe it.,11,Southpark,19,4,,,,,,,,,
4644,Stan,5,But why would Jesus want a rabbit to run his church?,11,Southpark,52,11,,,,,,,,,
4646,Kyle,5,So... the Vatican took Stan's dad?,11,Southpark,34,6,,,,,,,,,
4648,Randy,5,You monster! You have no right to wear that hat!,11,Southpark,48,10,,,,,,,,,
4650,Randy,5,It's saying stupid things like that that made Jesus wanna put a rabbit in charge.,11,Southpark,81,15,,,,,,,,,
4653,Randy,5,"I don't know! And even if I did know... well, I'd probably tell you because I don't wanna be here anymore.",11,Southpark,106,21,,,,,,,,,
4657,Randy,5,"No! No, you bunny-hating bastards! Don't do this!",11,Southpark,49,8,,,,,,,,,
4658,Stan,5,I don't get it. Why would the pope be holding my Dad hostage for Snowball?,11,Southpark,74,15,,,,,,,,,
4661,Stan,5,They found me!,11,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,
4667,Kyle,5,So what now?,11,Southpark,12,3,,,,,,,,,
4668,Stan,5,If the pope has my Dad... I have to give him what he wants.,11,Southpark,59,14,,,,,,,,,
4669,Kyle,5,You aren't just gonna hand Snowball over?,11,Southpark,41,7,,,,,,,,,
4670,Stan,5,"What choice do I have?! There's nobody left who can help us!  Wait... unless... maybe there is.  Here, hold this.  Jesus, I know we haven't talked in a long time, and I know that every time you appear we end up killing you somehow, but... I don't know what to do. And I could really use your help. ",11,Southpark,298,58,,,,,,,,,
4671,Kyle,5,I think the rabbit just crapped on my jacket.,11,Southpark,45,9,,,,,,,,,
4679,Randy,5,"Oh thank God! Hand it over, Stan! They're gonna kill me! Give them the rabbit!",11,Southpark,78,15,,,,,,,,,
4681,Stan,5,"First, you have to promise you won't hurt it! And that you'll let everybody go!",11,Southpark,79,15,,,,,,,,,
4684,Randy,5,"Just hand over the bunny, Stan!",11,Southpark,31,6,,,,,,,,,
4685,Stan,5,"Okay, fine. ",11,Southpark,12,2,,,,,,,,,
4686,Randy,5,"Stanley, why did you do that? I would have proudly died for that rabbit.",11,Southpark,72,14,,,,,,,,,
4687,Stan,5,"You said ""hand over the bunny.""",11,Southpark,31,6,,,,,,,,,
4688,Randy,5,No! That is not the way we're remembering it!,11,Southpark,45,9,,,,,,,,,
4690,Stan,5,"Hey, what the hell!",11,Southpark,19,4,,,,,,,,,
4693,Kyle,5,"You swore on the cross, fatso!",11,Southpark,30,6,,,,,,,,,
4695,Randy,5,"Oh, we should've seen that coming!",11,Southpark,34,6,,,,,,,,,
4704,Stan,5,"Jesus, you did answer my prayer! ",11,Southpark,33,6,,,,,,,,,

4728,Kyle,5,N-no way! Do it yourself.,11,Southpark,25,5,,,,,,,,,
4730,Kyle,5,"Dude, you don't understand, I'm a Jew. I have a few hang ups about killing Jesus.",11,Southpark,81,16,,,,,,,,,
4732,Kyle,5,Don't make me do this.,11,Southpark,22,5,,,,,,,,,
4734,Kyle,5,Eric Cartman can never know about this.,11,Southpark,39,7,,,,,,,,,

4753,Randy,5,"Stanley, I'm so proud of you. You've learned so very much this Easter.",11,Southpark,70,13,,,,,,,,,
4754,Stan,5,Yeah. I've learned not to ask questions. Just dye the eggs and keep my mouth shut.,11,Southpark,82,16,,,,,,,,,
4755,Randy,5,That's my boy.,11,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,

4769,Stan,6,"Dude, how are we supposed to read an entire book over the weekend and write an essay?",11,Southpark,85,17,,,,,,,,,

5493,Cartman,8,"Jesus Christ. How did I get myself into this?  God? Please uh, I know I screwed up. I should have never pretended to have Tourette's Syndrome, but see, ah I get it now. You can't just walk around saying whatever you want. You gave us a filter because, people don't wanna hear things like ""I touched penises with my cousin!""  Ahaab, ahaabuh. And, and I learned, you especially can't say whatever you want on national television, 'cause, there could be kids watching. Please, God, don't make me embarrass myself on national television.

5871,Stan,10,No no I I hardly got any sleep. I had this whole messed up dream about some gay Mayor guy taking us to Imaginationland where all these imaginary characters live?,11,Southpark,161,30,,,,,,,,,
5872,Kyle,10,...And then it got attacked by terrorists?,11,Southpark,42,7,,,,,,,,,
5873,Stan,10,Yeah! How'd you know?,11,Southpark,21,4,,,,,,,,,
5874,Kyle,10,"Dude! I had the same dream! We jumped on a dragon's back and, and Butters got left behind!",11,Southpark,90,18,,,,,,,,,

5889,Butters,10,"Praise to the mighty Allah. His divine grace a-and will have brought forth this day.  Oh jeez!  Uhhh, nnow see, your safety is at our whim. This is the price you pay, America! You have defiled Allah, and now we will turn your imagination against you! Death to the Infidels!  Can I go now?  Stan! Kyle! Could you could you get me out of here?? ",11,Southpark,343,65,,,,,,,,,
5891,Cartman,10,"I believe a serious blow to democracy has just been dealt.  A travesty has occurred, and I want justice! Kyle Broflovski did willingly and knowingly sign a contract, and yet, to date, he has made no effort, nor does he show any intention, of ever sucking my balls!  I've given him ample time to fulfill his obligation, and he has thus refused. I stand before you with dry balls, Your Honor. I've provided witnesses, collected testimonials, and still, my balls remain dry. I want what I'm entitled to!",11,Southpark,500,88,,,,,,,,,
5893,Kyle,10,I...,11,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,

5897,Cartman,10,Yesss!,11,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
5899,Cartman,10,"Thank you Your Honor. This isn't a victory for me, this is a victory for the justice system. And my balls.",11,Southpark,106,21,,,,,,,,,
5925,Butters,10,"Uh, excuse me? Uh Mr. Terrorist, sir?  Uh, I'm actually not imaginary, a-and um, my p-my parents are gonna ground me if I don't get back-  Aaah!  Okay, sorry. Uh sorry.",11,Southpark,168,31,,,,,,,,,

5939,Butters,10,Waaahaa!,11,Southpark,8,1,,,,,,,,,
5940,Cartman,10,"Thanks for coming, everyone. The big moment is almost here, as soon as Kyle arrives.",11,Southpark,84,15,,,,,,,,,

5956,Cartman,10,"No! No, he has to suck my balls!  NO! KYYYYLE! ",11,Southpark,47,10,,,,,,,,,
5958,Butters,10,"Hold on! Hold on a second!  Now, you really should think about this. I mean, uh, I I know you think attacking our imagination will get you somewhere, but will it really? If you destroy that wall, all the most evil parts of our imagination are gonna break loose, but... will it really make you terrorists feel better? Maybe it's time for us all to just... get along.",11,Southpark,365,68,,,,,,,,,
5962,Butters,10,"Y-yeah, and that's not a heartfelt speech?",11,Southpark,42,7,,,,,,,,,
5965,Cartman,10,"Yeah well, when a man has been wronged... he no longer cares about danger.",11,Southpark,74,14,,,,,,,,,
5967,Cartman,10,"I've got unfinished business. You go through life being told there's justice, then you learn that the only real justice...  is the justice you take.  Make no mistake, Kyle. Before this is over, you will suck my balls. ",11,Southpark,218,38,,,,,,,,,
5968,Cartman,11,Previously on Battlestar Galactica ,11,Southpark,35,4,,,,,,,,,

6001,Stan,11,No.,11,Southpark,3,1,,,,,,,,,
6004,Stan,11,Your what?,11,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,
6008,Kyle,11,Wait. The U.S. Government has a portal to the imagination?,11,Southpark,58,10,,,,,,,,,
6013,Stan,11,"If you already built a doorway to the imagination, then why do you need us?",11,Southpark,75,15,,,,,,,,,
6015,Cartman,11,"Every night, the dream is the same.  I'm on my way to visit my friend Kyle, because we had a bet that if I could prove leprechauns were real, he would suck my balls.  And it turns out I was right. ""Time to pay up, Kyle.""  But then...  ""NO! NOOO!""  It's been taken from me. I have dry balls. Balls so dry they explode like dust. ",11,Southpark,328,66,,,,,,,,,
6017,Cartman,11,NO. I've got dry balls. And I'm running out of time.,11,Southpark,52,11,,,,,,,,,
6019,Stan,11,That's not very imaginative.,11,Southpark,28,4,,,,,,,,,
6024,Kyle,11,Ah I guess.,11,Southpark,11,3,,,,,,,,,
6026,Kyle,11,"Look, we're sorry, you guys, but the balloon just went up in the air and the dude sang a song and we were suddenly there.",11,Southpark,121,25,,,,,,,,,
6029,Stan,11,The Imagination song?,11,Southpark,21,3,,,,,,,,,

6042,Butters,11,"Please, sir. I have to get home to my world.",11,Southpark,44,10,,,,,,,,,
6044,Butters,11,Really?,11,Southpark,7,1,,,,,,,,,
6067,Cartman,11,"Look, I want some Goddamn answers! You brought my friend here to Washington! Where is he?! What is going on?!",11,Southpark,109,20,,,,,,,,,
6069,Cartman,11,"Something is going on, and I have a right to know where my friend is!!",11,Southpark,70,15,,,,,,,,,

6108,Cartman,11,"Hello Kyle! Thought you could get out of your responsibilities, huh?!",11,Southpark,69,11,,,,,,,,,
6110,Cartman,11,"That kid you have made a bit that if I could prove that I saw a leprechaun, he would suck my balls!",11,Southpark,99,22,,,,,,,,,
6112,Cartman,11,No! Hold on a second!  I have a contract  validated by the United States court system!,11,Southpark,86,16,,,,,,,,,
6114,Kyle,11,I DIDN'T THINK THERE WAS GOING TO BE A GOD-DAMNED LEPRECHAUN!!,11,Southpark,62,11,,,,,,,,,

6124,Kyle,11,"Cartman, do you even know what's going on? We went to Imaginationland, terrorists attacked it, and now the government is about to-",11,Southpark,130,22,,,,,,,,,
6125,Cartman,11,"Oh jeez, I'm sorry, Kyle.  It's just that I'm so completely bored by this story. See, I'm really only interested in the part where the leprechaun was real, and so you have to suck my balls.",11,Southpark,189,36,,,,,,,,,
6126,Kyle,11,"Okay, fine. You know what? Let's just get it over with!",11,Southpark,55,11,,,,,,,,,
6127,Cartman,11,"Oh nonono, nononot so fast, Kyle.  I've waited a long time for this, and I intend to savor each and every second. ",11,Southpark,114,22,,,,,,,,,
6128,Kyle,11,"No, I'm serious! I wanna see what's happening downstairs, so let's just do it! ",11,Southpark,79,14,,,,,,,,,
6129,Cartman,11,"Not... just yet, Kyle. There's still a few things I need to do.  By the way, I should tell you that I haven't had a chance to shower while making my way up here. My balls are...  extra vinegary...",11,Southpark,196,39,,,,,,,,,

6147,Stan,11,Tell them to get away now!,11,Southpark,26,6,,,,,,,,,
6154,Cartman,11,I was thinking of using a high-speed shutter with a low depth of field. What do you think?,11,Southpark,90,18,,,,,,,,,
6155,Kyle,11,"Goddammit Cartman, will you stop wasting time? I wanna get this over with!",11,Southpark,74,13,,,,,,,,,
6156,Cartman,11,"No, you're right, Kyle. A higher depth of field will make sure everything stays in focus.  There we go.  Now, Kyle, when you're sucking my balls, are you gonna think about how right I was about the leprechaun, or are you just gonna try and focus on how rough and salty my balls feel in your mouth?",11,Southpark,297,57,,,,,,,,,
6157,Kyle,11,Let's just DO IT! ,11,Southpark,18,4,,,,,,,,,
6158,Cartman,11,"In time, Kyle. You certainly are eager for balls, aren't you? Are you ball-famished? Balls-starving? You see, Kyle, I wonder if at this moment you are actually- ",11,Southpark,161,27,,,,,,,,,

6242,Cartman,12,"You just rest, Kyle.  Look what I made for you. A sundae. It has hot fudge and whipped cream and a cherry-  but... I feel like something is missing; don't you, Kyle?  What else belongs on a sundae besides hot fudge and whipped cream,  let's see",11,Southpark,244,46,,,,,,,,,

6384,Cartman,12,"Look, maybe they're all part of the same thing. Santa and Jesus and hell and- leprechauns. Maybe they're all real in the same wway, right?",11,Southpark,138,25,,,,,,,,,
6391,Cartman,12,"No! Leprechauns are real, Goddammit!",11,Southpark,36,5,,,,,,,,,
6392,Stan,12,"Kyle? Kyle, what happened?",11,Southpark,26,4,,,,,,,,,
6393,Kyle,12,Nothing.,11,Southpark,8,1,,,,,,,,,
6394,Stan,12,What??,11,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
6395,Kyle,12,Nothing happened! There's nothing I can do! ,11,Southpark,44,7,,,,,,,,,
6396,Stan,12,"Dude, you can't let the government fire off that nuke!",11,Southpark,54,10,,,,,,,,,
6397,Kyle,12,They say they can do whatever they want because imaginary things aren't real!,11,Southpark,77,13,,,,,,,,,
6398,Stan,12,Well you have to convince them they are real!,11,Southpark,45,9,,,,,,,,,
6399,Kyle,12,"No way, dude, then I'd have to suck Cartman's balls",11,Southpark,51,10,,,,,,,,,
6400,Stan,12,"Whatever it takes, you have to do it, all right?!  Hang- hang on, Kyle, Jesus wants to talk to you.",11,Southpark,99,20,,,,,,,,,
6401,Kyle,12,Huh? ,11,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
6403,Kyle,12,Oh boy...,11,Southpark,9,2,,,,,,,,,
6405,Kyle,12,"Jesus, I can't do anything.  I'm just a fourth grader going against the entire government.  Uh, hello? Jesus?",11,Southpark,109,18,,,,,,,,,
6407,Kyle,12,Aah.,11,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
6409,Kyle,12,"Yeah, I guess.",11,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,
6412,Kyle,12,Hi Superman.,11,Southpark,12,2,,,,,,,,,
6414,Kyle,12,I know.,11,Southpark,7,2,,,,,,,,,
6416,Kyle,12,Oh God...,11,Southpark,9,2,,,,,,,,,
6422,Butters,12,More spinach for Popeye!  Imagine an M60 for Jesus!,11,Southpark,51,9,,,,,,,,,
6426,Cartman,12,"Goddamnit, you stupid assholes are going to ruin everything!",11,Southpark,60,9,,,,,,,,,
6432,Cartman,12,Kyle?,11,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
6434,Kyle,12,"Listen, you don't have to do this! Our imaginations aren't running wild anymore.",11,Southpark,80,13,,,,,,,,,
6436,Kyle,12,You have to stop!,11,Southpark,17,4,,,,,,,,,
6438,Kyle,12,"Because I-  I... Um... because I think... they are real. It's all real. Think about it. Haven't Luke Skywalker and Santa Claus affected your lives more than most real people in this room? I mean, whether Jesus is real or not, he... he's had a bigger impact on the world than any of us have. And the same could be said of Bugs Bunny and, a-and Superman and Harry Potter. They've changed my life, changed the way I act on the Earth. Doesn't that make them kind of ""real."" They might be imaginary, but, but they're more important than most of us here. And they're all gonna be around long after we're dead. So in a way, those things are more realer than any of us. ",11,Southpark,662,126,,,,,,,,,
6440,Cartman,12,"So Kyle, imaginary things are real, huh? Guess that means I did win the bet after all. And you know what that means, Kyle. ",11,Southpark,123,24,,,,,,,,,
6441,Kyle,12,"Just let it go with your fucking balls, you fucking asshole!! Your friends have been in danger and all you care about it this stupid bet! Well I've decided, Cartman, even if we had a bet, that I am never sucking your balls,  you got that?! They can throw me in jail for the rest of my life, but I am  never going to suck your balls,  never! So  there!",11,Southpark,351,70,,,,,,,,,
6448,Stan,12,Kyle!,11,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
6449,Butters,12,Fellas! Where'd you come from? ,11,Southpark,31,5,,,,,,,,,
6451,Butters,12,Huh... ,11,Southpark,7,1,,,,,,,,,
6456,Stan,12,"Dude! How did you do that, Butters?",11,Southpark,35,7,,,,,,,,,
6457,Butters,12,Well I just... used my imagination.,11,Southpark,35,6,,,,,,,,,
6459,Cartman,12,"You know, I really have learned a lot, you guys. What Kyle said about imaginary things being real and, Butters using his imagination? It makes me think that... well maybe we all have the power to make things a reality.   Why look, it's me. And...  And there's Kyle. And, what's Kyle about to do? ",11,Southpark,296,54,,,,,,,,,
6460,Kyle,12,"Cartman, don't!",11,Southpark,15,2,,,,,,,,,
6461,Cartman,12,"O-hoo Kyle! What are you doing to my balls? OHO, look! It's Kyle sucking my balls! ",11,Southpark,83,16,,,,,,,,,
6462,Stan,12,Dude.,11,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
6464,Cartman,12,"O-hoo Kyle, you are gobbling those balls, aren't you? I told you you would suck my balls before this was over, didn't I, Kyle?",11,Southpark,126,24,,,,,,,,,
6465,Kyle,12,I'm not sucking your balls; that's imaginary!,11,Southpark,45,7,,,,,,,,,
6466,Cartman,12,"No- Kyle, I believe you said that imaginary things are real.",11,Southpark,60,11,,,,,,,,,
6468,Cartman,12,"Oh, look at you go, Kyle! Oho, you dirty girl! You LOVE those balls. ",11,Southpark,69,14,,,,,,,,,
6470,Kyle,12,I am not sucking Cartman's balls!,11,Southpark,33,6,,,,,,,,,
6473,Butters,12,A-huh? What? Oh! It was all just a dream.,11,Southpark,41,9,,,,,,,,,
6475,Butters,12,"Oh Dad! I had the craziest dream! I, I saved all of Imaginationland from running wild after a terrorist attack!",11,Southpark,111,20,,,,,,,,,

6494,Butters,13,Stan and Kyle are really good at it.,11,Southpark,36,8,,,,,,,,,
6495,Randy,13,"Well you kids wanna see something really cool?  Check this out. Once, I rose above the noise and confusionJust to get a glimpse beyond this illusion.I was soaring ever higherBut I flew too high.Though my eyes could see I-",11,Southpark,221,39,,,,,,,,,
6496,Stan,13,Dad? Dad! What are you doing?!,11,Southpark,30,6,,,,,,,,,
6497,Randy,13,I can actually play a lot of these songs on a real guitar. You want me to teach you boys how?,11,Southpark,93,21,,,,,,,,,
6498,Cartman,13,"Uhh, that's gay, Mr. Marsh.",11,Southpark,27,5,,,,,,,,,

6511,Stan,13,"Dude, we are total rock stars now!",11,Southpark,34,7,,,,,,,,,

6592,Kyle,13,I guess I didn't realize it was just about the points. ,11,Southpark,55,11,,,,,,,,,
6594,Stan,13,"Let's just do this, all right? ",11,Southpark,31,6,,,,,,,,,
6596,Stan,13,"It's okay, I guess. But I need some game guides for it. My manager and producer set up this live thing at the video arcade where I'm supposed to break a million in front of everybody and I'm I'm stressing out.",11,Southpark,209,41,,,,,,,,,
6598,Stan,13,Huh?,11,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,

6615,Stan,13,"Yeah? Well you're not the leader, are you, Thad?! We play the music I wanna play!",11,Southpark,81,16,,,,,,,,,
6617,Stan,13,"We're playing what I want, and I'll select a different song!",11,Southpark,60,11,,,,,,,,,
6619,Stan,13,"You know what? That's great with me, Thad, 'cause I don't need you to break a million points! I never did!",11,Southpark,106,21,,,,,,,,,

6633,Kyle,13,No. You're thinking of somebody else.,11,Southpark,37,6,,,,,,,,,
6636,Kyle,13,"Look, just go ahead and play, alright?  Leave me alone.  Can I get a Fresca, please?",11,Southpark,84,16,,,,,,,,,
6638,Kyle,13,"Yeah well, I can't really afford to play anymore anyway. I'm about out of quarters.",11,Southpark,83,15,,,,,,,,,
6640,Kyle,13,"I appreciate what you're trying to do, Mick, but I ain't a charity case yet.",11,Southpark,76,15,,,,,,,,,
6642,Kyle,13,"Thanks, Mick.",11,Southpark,13,2,,,,,,,,,
6645,Stan,13,"Huh? What, uh?",11,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,

6658,Cartman,13,Come on guys. Let's get out of here. ,11,Southpark,37,8,,,,,,,,,
6662,Stan,13,"No, I didn't break a million points and unlock superstardom, all right? I'm done with that stupid game!",11,Southpark,103,18,,,,,,,,,
6664,Stan,13,I just wanna find something else to play.,11,Southpark,41,8,,,,,,,,,
6666,Stan,13,"I just want a nice, simple... driving game. How about that?",11,Southpark,59,11,,,,,,,,,
6670,Stan,13,"Kyle, could I just talk to you for like five minutes?",11,Southpark,53,11,,,,,,,,,
6671,Kyle,13,What are you doing here? ,11,Southpark,25,5,,,,,,,,,
6672,Stan,13,"Please, ih ih, it won't take long.",11,Southpark,34,7,,,,,,,,,
6673,Kyle,13,Goddamnit. We're gonna take a short break. Be back in five. ,11,Southpark,60,11,,,,,,,,,
6674,Stan,13,"I was listening to you for a while. Dude, you've gotten a lot better. ",11,Southpark,70,14,,,,,,,,,
6675,Kyle,13,"Oh, thank you! I was so eagerly awaiting your approval of my abilities! ",11,Southpark,72,13,,,,,,,,,
6676,Stan,13,"Look, Kyle, the game is still set up at my house and, maybe we could go try playing it again over there.",11,Southpark,104,22,,,,,,,,,
6677,Kyle,13,"Oh, so the gallant knight now comes to rescue me from the bowels of mediocrity! Oh, thank you, your royal lordship! ",11,Southpark,116,21,,,,,,,,,
6678,Stan,13,That isn't it at all. ,11,Southpark,22,5,,,,,,,,,
6679,Kyle,13,"You don't get it, Stan! I can play here all I want. I even get free Frescas. I don't need you anymore! ",11,Southpark,103,22,,,,,,,,,
6680,Stan,13,"I know. I need you.  I thought I was having a great time because I was getting signed by managers and, going to big sex and coke parties, but, then I realized, I was having fun because I was doing all that...  ...with my best friend.",11,Southpark,233,46,,,,,,,,,
6681,Kyle,13,"It was pretty fun, wasn't it?",11,Southpark,29,6,,,,,,,,,
6682,Stan,13,Yeah.,11,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
6683,Kyle,13,"Look, I doubt we could break a million together anyway.",11,Southpark,55,10,,,,,,,,,
6684,Stan,13,I don't care. I'd just like to play with you again. For the fun of it.,11,Southpark,70,16,,,,,,,,,
6685,Kyle,13,I don't really see the fun in...  ...not trying to kick that game's ass once and for all!,11,Southpark,89,18,,,,,,,,,
6686,Stan,13,"What, you mean it?",11,Southpark,18,4,,,,,,,,,
6687,Kyle,13,"I think we can do it, Stan. I've been close to a million a few times by myself.",11,Southpark,79,18,,,,,,,,,

6722,Butters,14,I donno.,11,Southpark,8,2,,,,,,,,,
6724,Butters,14,I don't know. Ih it's like a girl thing. They won't let anybody see the list but them. ,11,Southpark,87,18,,,,,,,,,
6725,Cartman,14,They can't do that. Who are they to judge us on how we look?,11,Southpark,60,14,,,,,,,,,
6726,Stan,14,"Yeah. You think they rate us just for looks, or they take personality into account?",11,Southpark,83,15,,,,,,,,,
6728,Kyle,14,"You guys, who cares if the girls make some stupid list? Girls make dumb lists all the time.",11,Southpark,91,18,,,,,,,,,
6729,Cartman,14,"Yeah, Kyle's right. Screw it; we have better things to worry about.",11,Southpark,67,12,,,,,,,,,
6731,Cartman,14,"Oh please, I don't think so, Craig! Chicks think I'm way hotter than you!",11,Southpark,73,14,,,,,,,,,
6733,Cartman,14,"No, because people know I'm not fat! I'm buff. They probably put you at the bottom of the list because you have fucked up teeth! Or Kenny cause' he's poor",11,Southpark,154,30,,,,,,,,,
6734,Kenny,14,,11,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
6735,Cartman,14,"Kenny, face it: Girls don't wanna Pop Tarts for dinner every night when they get married.",11,Southpark,89,16,,,,,,,,,
6736,Butters,14,"You don't think they said I'm the ugliest boy in the class, do ya? Well if they did, my parents will ground me.",11,Southpark,111,23,,,,,,,,,
6737,Kyle,14,"You guys, do you really care what a bunch of girls have to say about how you rank in looks?! ",11,Southpark,93,20,,,,,,,,,
6738,Cartman,14,"All right, Bebe, let's see the list.",11,Southpark,36,7,,,,,,,,,
6740,Cartman,14,"You know what I'm talking about, bitch! The list where you rate the looks of each boy in the class!",11,Southpark,99,20,,,,,,,,,
6742,Cartman,14,"Craig is on the bottom, right? Or is it Kenny 'cause you'd be eating Pop Tarts for dinner if you married him.",11,Southpark,109,22,,,,,,,,,
6744,Cartman,14,Fuck you Bebe! Fuck you bitch!,11,Southpark,30,6,,,,,,,,,
6745,Butters,14,"Well, I guess we're never gonna get that list from the girls.",11,Southpark,61,12,,,,,,,,,
6746,Cartman,14,"Screw that, dude! We're guys. We can outthink them.",11,Southpark,51,9,,,,,,,,,
6747,Cartman,14,"All right, here's what we know. That chick Nelly is the one who's in charge of holding the list, right. She apparently keeps it in a purple Pee Chee folder, and we need a plan to get it from her.  This is what I call ""Operation: Cannot Possibly Fail"" ",11,Southpark,251,49,,,,,,,,,
6748,Butters,14,Neato!,11,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
6749,Cartman,14,"At 1. p.m. tomorrow, Nelly will have to walk from Home Ec to Social Studies. That's our best time to strike. As she makes her way through Hallway 3, Craig will be ready with a distraction device here.  When she stops and turns to Craig in the hallway, Butters will run up and kick her in the balls.",11,Southpark,298,58,,,,,,,,,
6750,Butters,14,O-kay!,11,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
6751,Cartman,14,"Once Butters kicks her in the balls, she'll fall to the floor, dropping the Pee Chee, and Kenny will swoop in from Corridor 3-Delta, and grab the Pee Chee. Are we good?",11,Southpark,168,32,,,,,,,,,
6753,Cartman,14,"Bail, bail! ",11,Southpark,12,2,,,,,,,,,
6754,Cartman,14,"Okay, our mission failed, but we've learned a lot. Primarily that girls do not have balls.",11,Southpark,90,16,,,,,,,,,
6755,Butters,14,They sure don't.,11,Southpark,16,3,,,,,,,,,
6756,Cartman,14,"Never mind, because we are going to Plan B, one that I call ""Operation: Cannot Possibly Fail A Second Time."" When Nelly leaves the cafeteria for recess, Kenny will jump in front of her and spit on the ground.",11,Southpark,208,39,,,,,,,,,
6757,Butters,14,You think maybe girls keep their balls on the inside of their tummies?,11,Southpark,70,13,,,,,,,,,
6758,Cartman,14,"Butters, we're done talkin' about girls' balls right now! Pay attention! ",11,Southpark,73,11,,,,,,,,,
6759,Cartman,14,We got it! We got it! ,11,Southpark,22,6,,,,,,,,,
6762,Cartman,14,"Tape it to the wall, Kenny! Jason, watch the door! ",11,Southpark,51,10,,,,,,,,,
6768,Stan,14,It's listed in order from cutest to ugliest. Clyde's number one.,11,Southpark,64,11,,,,,,,,,
6770,Stan,14,"And then Token, and then me.",11,Southpark,28,6,,,,,,,,,
6772,Butters,14,"Come on, let me see!  Oh boy! I'm number 11! Whoopie! Number 11! ",11,Southpark,65,13,,,,,,,,,
6774,Cartman,14,What?! That's bullcrap! ,11,Southpark,24,3,,,,,,,,,
6775,Kenny,14, ,11,Southpark,1,0,,,,,,,,,
6776,Kyle,14,"Oh, so big deal, guys! Do you feel better now? Clyde's the best looking kid in the class. And then Token and Stan, and last is Francis, Cartman, and...  Me?",11,Southpark,156,30,,,,,,,,,
6777,Cartman,14,"You're last, dude! ",11,Southpark,19,3,,,,,,,,,
6778,Kyle,14,No way.,11,Southpark,7,2,,,,,,,,,
6779,Cartman,14,Yes way! Check it out! ,11,Southpark,23,5,,,,,,,,,
6780,Stan,14,"Cartman, lay off! You're next to last.",11,Southpark,38,7,,,,,,,,,
6781,Cartman,14,So? I'm hotter than Kyle.  I'm better looking than Kyyyle!  Yes! I'm hotter than Kyyyle! I'm hotter than Kyyyle!,11,Southpark,112,19,,,,,,,,,
6782,Kyle,14,I'm last? Last?,11,Southpark,15,3,,,,,,,,,
6783,Stan,14,"Dude, it's just a stupid list, remember?",11,Southpark,40,7,,,,,,,,,
6784,Kyle,14,I got voted the ugliest boy in the whole class?,11,Southpark,47,10,,,,,,,,,
6785,Stan,14,"Who cares what dumb girls think, right? ",11,Southpark,40,7,,,,,,,,,
6786,Butters,14,"Mom, Dad! I'm not the ugliest kid in the class! Kyle Broflovski is!",11,Southpark,67,13,,,,,,,,,
6789,Butters,14,Whoopie! ,11,Southpark,9,1,,,,,,,,,
6792,Kyle,14,The... girls at school. They made a list and voted me the ugliest boy.,11,Southpark,70,14,,,,,,,,,
6794,Kyle,14,"Llook, I know I'm not the best-looking guy in town, but I I didn't think I was the very ugliest.",11,Southpark,96,20,,,,,,,,,
6796,Kyle,14,Oh God! I do?,11,Southpark,13,4,,,,,,,,,
6798,Kyle,14,Ahahah!,11,Southpark,7,1,,,,,,,,,
6800,Kyle,14,"Ike, Ike, you have to be honest. Am I ugly, yes or no?  You ALL think I'm ugly. Jesus Christ, the least you could have done is told me!",11,Southpark,135,29,,,,,,,,,
6802,Cartman,14,"I'm better-looking than you!  The girls think I'm better-looking than you, Kyle!",11,Southpark,80,12,,,,,,,,,
6803,Kyle,14,Hrrgh! ,11,Southpark,7,1,,,,,,,,,
6804,Cartman,14,"Dude, Kyle. Can you hear me? They totally think I'm hotter than you are.  Kyle! Kyle, I'm more attractive.  Kyle?",11,Southpark,113,20,,,,,,,,,
6812,Butters,14,Hey ugly! ,11,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,
6815,Butters,14,"Hehehe. Hey, nice... nice ears, haha. Pizza Face! ",11,Southpark,50,8,,,,,,,,,
6817,Cartman,14,"Kyle, I was going to suggest that maybe you should... hang out with the other ugly kids in the school. Because if you hang out with them, you won't stand out so much. Right?  Cool. ",11,Southpark,181,35,,,,,,,,,
6819,Kyle,14,Hello. ,11,Southpark,7,1,,,,,,,,,
6823,Kyle,14,Yeah.,11,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
6825,Kyle,14,No. You know what? Screw this! We aren't ugly!,11,Southpark,46,9,,,,,,,,,
6827,Kyle,14,"No! Maybe we all just need a little image change, you know? Like a makeover.",11,Southpark,76,15,,,,,,,,,
6829,Kyle,14,Like you! Maybe you just need to let your hair down. And let's see how you look without those glasses.  Let's just... put those back on. ,11,Southpark,137,26,,,,,,,,,
6831,Stan,14,Uh Wendy. Could I talk to you?,11,Southpark,30,7,,,,,,,,,
6833,Stan,14,Just for a minute. Over here. ,11,Southpark,30,6,,,,,,,,,
6836,Stan,14,"Yeah well, I wanna talk to you about this list you girls made.",11,Southpark,62,13,,,,,,,,,
6838,Stan,14,"The one where you rated the boys' looks in the class. Look, it really messed Kyle up, okay? How could you vote him the ugliest?",11,Southpark,127,25,,,,,,,,,
6840,Stan,14,So it wasn't unanimous. Maybe you can just change the list.,11,Southpark,59,11,,,,,,,,,
6842,Stan,14,Can't we just talk to all the girls who made the list and find out why they voted Kyle last?,11,Southpark,92,20,,,,,,,,,
6858,Stan,14,"Aaah, I was just thinking that maybe you voted a little... hastily on the cutest boy?",11,Southpark,85,16,,,,,,,,,
6860,Stan,14,NO.,11,Southpark,3,1,,,,,,,,,
6865,Kyle,14,They all laugh at me!  And the girls giggle behind my back!  unable to even glance at my disfigured face.,11,Southpark,105,20,,,,,,,,,
6867,Kyle,14,Who said that?,11,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,
6869,Kyle,14,Abraham Lincoln?,11,Southpark,16,2,,,,,,,,,
6873,Kyle,14,But I can't wait to be an adult to be happy. That's forever from now.,11,Southpark,69,15,,,,,,,,,
6875,Kyle,14,Just take me home! I don't wanna be here anymore! Take me home!,11,Southpark,63,13,,,,,,,,,
6878,Kyle,14,I don't want to! I don't want anybody telling me how to feel anymore!,11,Southpark,69,14,,,,,,,,,
6881,Stan,14,I have no idea what you're talking about.,11,Southpark,41,8,,,,,,,,,
6888,Stan,14,"That didn't sparkle with her, did it?",11,Southpark,37,7,,,,,,,,,
6890,Kyle,14,That should just about do it.,11,Southpark,29,6,,,,,,,,,
6905,Stan,14,What's going on?,11,Southpark,16,3,,,,,,,,,
6912,Stan,14,"Jesus, dude! ",11,Southpark,13,2,,,,,,,,,
6913,Stan,14,"Hey, kid, have you seen Kyle? We've looked everywhere and we have to show him something.",11,Southpark,88,16,,,,,,,,,
6917,Kyle,14,"All the cruel jokes and ridicule will finally be over! Are you happy now, God?! YOU made me look like this!",11,Southpark,107,21,,,,,,,,,
6918,Stan,14,"Kyle! Kyle, don't!",11,Southpark,18,3,,,,,,,,,
6919,Kyle,14,"Don't try and stop me, Stan! You don't know how it feels to be a deformed monstrosity!",11,Southpark,86,17,,,,,,,,,
6920,Stan,14,"The list was a forgery, Kyle!",11,Southpark,29,6,,,,,,,,,
6921,Kyle,14,Huh??,11,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
6922,Stan,14,It didn't sparkle with all the girls. We have the real list. ,11,Southpark,61,12,,,,,,,,,
6924,Kyle,14,"Stan, what is going on?!",11,Southpark,24,5,,,,,,,,,
6925,Stan,14,"It was about shoes, Kyle. The girls wanted shoes, so they set you up.",11,Southpark,69,14,,,,,,,,,
6927,Kyle,14,So what number was I??,11,Southpark,22,5,,,,,,,,,
6934,Stan,14,Wendy!,11,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
6937,Kyle,14,She's gonna kill us?,11,Southpark,20,4,,,,,,,,,
6941,Stan,14,Wendy! ,11,Southpark,7,1,,,,,,,,,
6942,Kenny,14, ,11,Southpark,1,0,,,,,,,,,
6945,Stan,14,"Here, Kyle.  We've been through a lot, but, you can finally see where you really are on the list. ",11,Southpark,98,19,,,,,,,,,
6946,Stan,14,"Are you sure you're okay with this, Kyle?",11,Southpark,41,8,,,,,,,,,
6947,Kyle,14,I'm sure. Abe Lincoln was right: I don't wanna find out I'm good-looking and become a total shithead when I grow up.,11,Southpark,116,22,,,,,,,,,
6948,Stan,14,...Abe Lincoln?,11,Southpark,15,2,,,,,,,,,
6950,Stan,14,"Yeah well, I guess a lot of things... change, don't they?  Bwaaaagh! Bwaaaagh! ",11,Southpark,79,13,,,,,,,,,
6952,Cartman,1,AHHHHHH.,12,Southpark,8,1,,,,,,,,,
6954,Cartman,1,What?,12,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
6957,Cartman,1,"No- No way. I'm not going to the hospital, Mom!",12,Southpark,47,10,,,,,,,,,
6959,Cartman,1,"No, I'm not scared... I just- I don't want my tonsils out, that's all!",12,Southpark,70,14,,,,,,,,,
6961,Cartman,1,...Ice cream?,12,Southpark,13,2,,,,,,,,,
6964,Cartman,1,Well...you did say free ice cream? ,12,Southpark,35,6,,,,,,,,,
6966,Cartman,1,Uh. It's over?,12,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,
6968,Cartman,1,"Its over! I didn't feel anything! You were right, Mom!",12,Southpark,54,10,,,,,,,,,
6970,Cartman,1,"All right, so where's my ice cream?",12,Southpark,35,7,,,,,,,,,
6972,Cartman,1,"You were right, doctor! Everything is okay!",12,Southpark,43,7,,,,,,,,,
6975,Cartman,1,What's that supposed to mean?!,12,Southpark,30,5,,,,,,,,,
6977,Cartman,1,I HAVE AIDS?,12,Southpark,12,3,,,,,,,,,
6979,Cartman,1,"""SORRY""?! YOU GAVE ME AIDS AND YOU'RE ""SORRY""?!",12,Southpark,47,8,,,,,,,,,
6981,Cartman,1,"Mom, you said nothing would go wrong!",12,Southpark,37,7,,,,,,,,,
6983,Cartman,1,"No! No, this is a joke, right!? This is a joke; I can't have AIDS!",12,Southpark,66,15,,,,,,,,,
6985,Cartman,1,Fuck your ice cream! You said I'd be fine! You all said I'd be FINE!,12,Southpark,68,15,,,,,,,,,
6987,Cartman,1,NO! NOOOOOOOO!,12,Southpark,14,2,,,,,,,,,
6990,Stan,1,What's going on? Are we in trouble?,12,Southpark,35,7,,,,,,,,,
6992,Stan,1,...What?,12,Southpark,8,1,,,,,,,,,
6993,Butters,1,Oh no.,12,Southpark,6,2,,,,,,,,,
6995,Kyle,1,Cartman has HIV?,12,Southpark,16,3,,,,,,,,,
6997,Kyle,1,Excuse me. Eric Cartman has HIV?,12,Southpark,32,6,,,,,,,,,
7000,Kyle,1,...No. Way.,12,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
7001,Butters,1,"How ya doin', Eric? You know, I think you're a real special little guy, and even though you have AIDS, I ain't gonna act any different towards you. ",12,Southpark,148,28,,,,,,,,,
7002,Cartman,1,"God damn it, this sucks ass!",12,Southpark,28,6,,,,,,,,,
7003,Kyle,1,"...Excuse me, I have to step out for a minute. ",12,Southpark,47,10,,,,,,,,,
7004,Butters,1,Poor Kyle. He's really taking it hard.,12,Southpark,38,7,,,,,,,,,
7005,Cartman,1,"Is Kyle laughing out there!? This isn't a time for funny jokes, I'm gonna die!",12,Southpark,78,15,,,,,,,,,
7007,Cartman,1,"Not a big deal!? Is that how everyone feels!? People need to understand the seriousness of this illness, and the bravery of the people who struggle with it!",12,Southpark,156,28,,,,,,,,,
7009,Cartman,1,Where the hell is everybody? ,12,Southpark,29,5,,,,,,,,,
7012,Butters,1,"Great benefit, Eric!",12,Southpark,20,3,,,,,,,,,
7014,Cartman,1,So this is it?,12,Southpark,14,4,,,,,,,,,
7016,Cartman,1,"Well that's just great! Of all the times to get AIDS, I get it right when everyone stops givin' a crap!",12,Southpark,103,21,,,,,,,,,
7018,Cartman,1,Just bring out Elton John already!,12,Southpark,34,6,,,,,,,,,
7021,Cartman,1,Jimmy Buffett?!,12,Southpark,15,2,,,,,,,,,
7023,Cartman,1,Nobody likes Jimmy Buffett except for frat boys and alcoholic chicks from the South!,12,Southpark,84,14,,,,,,,,,
7025,Cartman,1,"Fuck you, Jimmy Buffett! You fuckin' suck!",12,Southpark,42,7,,,,,,,,,
7027,Cartman,1,"Fuck you Mom, I have fucking AIDS!",12,Southpark,34,7,,,,,,,,,
7028,Cartman,1,"Hey guys, thanks a lot for comin' to my AIDS benefit yesterday.",12,Southpark,63,12,,,,,,,,,
7029,Stan,1,"Oh dude, was that yesterday? We forgot.",12,Southpark,39,7,,,,,,,,,
7030,Cartman,1,"Yeah, you forgot. Just like a lot of people lately have forgot that AIDS is still killing people! Seems like all of America has forgot that HIV is a serious disease.",12,Southpark,165,31,,,,,,,,,
7031,Stan,1,"Well, did... Elton John sing a song for you?",12,Southpark,44,9,,,,,,,,,
7032,Cartman,1,"...No, as a matter of fact, Jimmy Buffett came instead.  Oh yeah, it's real fuckin' funny, Kyle!",12,Southpark,96,17,,,,,,,,,
7033,Kyle,1,"I'm sorry. I'm. I'm really. Cartman, I f-I feel really bad for you. Honestly.",12,Southpark,77,14,,,,,,,,,
7034,Cartman,1,No you don't!,12,Southpark,13,3,,,,,,,,,
7035,Kyle,1,I do. ,12,Southpark,6,2,,,,,,,,,
7036,Cartman,1,"If you really felt bad, you'd wipe that fucking smirk off your face!  Well any God damned second, Kyle!",12,Southpark,103,19,,,,,,,,,
7037,Kyle,1,I'm sorry. I gotta go home. ,12,Southpark,28,6,,,,,,,,,
7038,Cartman,1,"Jesus Christ, can you believe that asshole?!",12,Southpark,44,7,,,,,,,,,
7039,Stan,1,"He does feel bad for you, Cartman; he just thinks it's... ironic.",12,Southpark,65,12,,,,,,,,,
7040,Cartman,1,Ironic how?,12,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
7041,Stan,1,"Well, you know, you're always such a dick and stuff, and, and now...",12,Southpark,68,13,,,,,,,,,
7042,Cartman,1,"Oh, and what?! I deserve it?! Is that what you think?!",12,Southpark,54,11,,,,,,,,,
7043,Stan,1,"Not me! That's, uh, kinda what he thinks.",12,Southpark,41,8,,,,,,,,,
7044,Cartman,1,"Nobody deserves this illness, Stan, Kenny! Nobody! It's awful! And maybe somebody needs to teach Kyle how to have some compassion!",12,Southpark,130,21,,,,,,,,,
7045,Butters,1,"Oh, uh-okay, it's clear.",12,Southpark,24,4,,,,,,,,,
7046,Cartman,1,"All right, get that rope ready to hoist me up. ",12,Southpark,47,10,,,,,,,,,
7047,Butters,1,"Okay, but... what are you going to do?",12,Southpark,38,8,,,,,,,,,
7048,Cartman,1,"Kyle thinks that HIV is funny, so we're gonna make him look funny, and then he'll know how it feels to be laughed at.",12,Southpark,117,24,,,,,,,,,
7049,Butters,1,I just uh... well I don't know if I should be helping you make Kyle look silly.,12,Southpark,79,17,,,,,,,,,
7050,Cartman,1,"Butters, helping people who have AIDS is one of the most important things you can do.",12,Southpark,85,16,,,,,,,,,
7051,Butters,1,"I know, but are you sure Kyle has to be taught a lesson?",12,Southpark,56,13,,,,,,,,,
7052,Cartman,1,"I'm not just sure, Butters. I'm HIV-positive.",12,Southpark,45,7,,,,,,,,,
7053,Butters,1,"Oh yeah, uh-well I guess that's true.",12,Southpark,37,7,,,,,,,,,
7054,Cartman,1,"All right, now get the rope up over that third rafter above the window; that's the easiest access.",12,Southpark,98,18,,,,,,,,,
7055,Butters,1,"Wow, you really know what you're doing.",12,Southpark,39,7,,,,,,,,,
7056,Cartman,1,"Yeah, I've sneaked into Kyle's room lots of times.  You think HIV is something to be laughed at, Kyle? Well...  let's just see how funny it is now, asshole. ",12,Southpark,157,29,,,,,,,,,
7057,Kyle,1,Wagh.,12,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
7064,Kyle,1,What? No?!,12,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,
7067,Kyle,1,What?,12,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
7072,Kyle,1,"No! No God damn it no! I'm telling you you're wrong! There, there's no way I can have HIV! Unless maybe...  Oh my God. That son of a bitch! ",12,Southpark,140,29,,,,,,,,,
7074,Cartman,1,"Pass me the ball!  Pass me the ball, Craig, you stupid asshole!  Kyle, what the F?!",12,Southpark,83,16,,,,,,,,,
7075,Kyle,1,"I'm gonna kill you, Cartman!",12,Southpark,28,5,,,,,,,,,
7076,Cartman,1,"Kyle, what?!",12,Southpark,12,2,,,,,,,,,
7077,Stan,1,What did he do?,12,Southpark,15,4,,,,,,,,,
7078,Kyle,1,Why do I have HIV?!,12,Southpark,19,5,,,,,,,,,
7080,Cartman,1,"Oh, you have HIV, huh Kyle? Guess it isn't so funny now, is it?",12,Southpark,63,14,,,,,,,,,
7081,Kyle,1,What did you do?!,12,Southpark,17,4,,,,,,,,,
7082,Cartman,1,Nothing!,12,Southpark,8,1,,,,,,,,,
7083,Kyle,1,Then why did Butters say he helped you sneak into my room last Friday night?! ,12,Southpark,78,15,,,,,,,,,
7084,Cartman,1,"Oh nice, Butters, you big tattle-tale. ",12,Southpark,39,6,,,,,,,,,
7085,Kyle,1,Tattle-tale?! Do you know how serious this is?!,12,Southpark,47,8,,,,,,,,,
7086,Cartman,1,"Well, Kyle, maybe I was just trying to prove a p-",12,Southpark,49,11,,,,,,,,,
7087,Kyle,1,AAAAAAA! ,12,Southpark,9,1,,,,,,,,,
7088,Cartman,1,Kyle!,12,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
7089,Kyle,1,Here you go!  Here you go! ,12,Southpark,27,6,,,,,,,,,
7092,Kyle,1,He gave me AIDS!,12,Southpark,16,4,,,,,,,,,
7094,Kyle,1,He purposely infected me with his HIV virus!,12,Southpark,44,8,,,,,,,,,
7096,Cartman,1,Well he was being a total dick! And he's a big tattle-tale and going around and talking crap about me!,12,Southpark,102,20,,,,,,,,,
7098,Cartman,1,Kind of.,12,Southpark,8,2,,,,,,,,,
7101,Cartman,1,I'm sorry.,12,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,
7102,Kyle,1,An apology?!,12,Southpark,12,2,,,,,,,,,
7104,Cartman,1,"I'm sorry for giving you AIDS, Kyle.",12,Southpark,36,7,,,,,,,,,
7106,Kyle,1,...What?!,12,Southpark,9,1,,,,,,,,,
7108,Kyle,1,A tattle-tale?! He infected me with AIDS!,12,Southpark,41,7,,,,,,,,,
7109,Cartman,1,See? He's tattling again. He hasn't learned a thing you guys. ,12,Southpark,62,11,,,,,,,,,
7110,Cartman,1,"Well Kyle, I guess we're even now. Shall we just call it a truce? Kyle? Shall we call it Even Stevens now?  Kyle, where are you going?",12,Southpark,134,27,,,,,,,,,
7111,Kyle,1,I'm going to break everything that you own! ,12,Southpark,44,8,,,,,,,,,
7112,Cartman,1,"What's that supposed to mean? Kyle?  Kyle, no! I apologized, Kyle!",12,Southpark,66,11,,,,,,,,,
7113,Cartman,1,"Kyle! Kyle, hold on, you asshole!  What the fuck are you doing?!  Kyle, stop it!  God damn it, don't!  Kyle, no! Not Clyde Frog! Leave Clyde Frog alone!  NO!!  AHH! Clyde Frog!! Clyde Frog you ba- no! Not the Xbox, Kyle!  Not the X-wait! WAIT A SECOND!  I'm sorry I gave you HIV, all right?! Just give me a chance, and I can cure you!",12,Southpark,334,65,,,,,,,,,
7114,Kyle,1,"There is no cure, you asshole!",12,Southpark,30,6,,,,,,,,,
7115,Cartman,1,"No, no, listen, Kyle! I'm on to something. There really is hope.",12,Southpark,64,12,,,,,,,,,
7116,Kyle,1,What hope?!,12,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
7117,Cartman,1,Break my Xbox and you'll never know.,12,Southpark,36,7,,,,,,,,,
7118,Kyle,1,You're lying!,12,Southpark,13,2,,,,,,,,,
7119,Cartman,1,"NO! No-al-, all right Kyle! Magic Johnson, Kyle! The key is Magic Johnson.",12,Southpark,74,13,,,,,,,,,
7120,Kyle,1,Magic Johnson?,12,Southpark,14,2,,,,,,,,,
7121,Cartman,1,He was a basketball player.,12,Southpark,27,5,,,,,,,,,
7122,Kyle,1,So what?!,12,Southpark,9,2,,,,,,,,,
7123,Cartman,1,"So he got HIV like fifty years ago, and he's still totally fine! Magic Johnson has some kind of resistance to the virus, Kyle. I've been researching it since I got infected. If we can track him down and isolate his genetic prototype, we have a chance of beating this thing, buddy.  You and me, Kyle. We can overcome our illness; I swear it to you!",12,Southpark,347,66,,,,,,,,,
7124,Kyle,1,"You better! 'Cause if you don't find a cure for HIV, I will break your Xbox!",12,Southpark,76,16,,,,,,,,,
7125,Cartman,1,My God...,12,Southpark,9,2,,,,,,,,,
7126,Cartman,1,We need two tickets to Los Angeles as soon as possible.,12,Southpark,55,11,,,,,,,,,
7128,Cartman,1,"Ah, sir, you don't understand. We have to see Magic Johnson right away. You see, we have AIDS.",12,Southpark,94,18,,,,,,,,,
7130,Cartman,1,"Don't you get it?! We are two pals afflicted with an illness, and who only have each other in a race against time! Innocent playful children who are stricken with a deadly disease for no reason!",12,Southpark,194,36,,,,,,,,,
7131,Kyle,1,"Oh please, no reason! I got AIDS from him!",12,Southpark,42,9,,,,,,,,,
7133,Kyle,1,NO!,12,Southpark,3,1,,,,,,,,,
7135,Cartman,1,"We're not just sure, we're HIV-positive.",12,Southpark,40,6,,,,,,,,,
7137,Cartman,1,"Forget it, all right?! We'll use another airline! One that cares! ",12,Southpark,66,11,,,,,,,,,
7139,Cartman,1,"Oh uh, you know, all over cancer.",12,Southpark,33,7,,,,,,,,,
7141,Cartman,1,"Yeah, well, at least  it's not as bad as having AIDS. AIDS is the worst disease.",12,Southpark,80,16,,,,,,,,,
7143,Cartman,1,"No you wouldn't! Look, shouldn't you be serving people drinks or something?! Get outta here!  We're on our way, buddy.  Magic Johnson, here we come.",12,Southpark,148,25,,,,,,,,,
7144,Kyle,1,Don't. Touch me.,12,Southpark,16,3,,,,,,,,,
7145,Cartman,1,I know. I'm scared too.,12,Southpark,23,5,,,,,,,,,
7147,Kyle,1,"Thank you for seeing us, Mr. Johnson. We were hoping that maybe you have some kind of key that can help us with our disease.",12,Southpark,124,25,,,,,,,,,
7149,Cartman,1,"We're not just sure, we're HIV-positive.",12,Southpark,40,6,,,,,,,,,
7150,Kyle,1,Will you stop it with that?! What part of this is funny to you?!,12,Southpark,64,14,,,,,,,,,
7151,Cartman,1,"Kyle, we need to try to find a-",12,Southpark,31,8,,,,,,,,,
7152,Kyle,1,What part of being infected with a deadly disease do you find funny?!,12,Southpark,69,13,,,,,,,,,
7153,Cartman,1,"I don't think it's funny, Kyle.",12,Southpark,31,6,,,,,,,,,
7154,Kyle,1,"Then stop saying you're not just sure, you're HIV-positive!  This isn't funny, AIDS isn't funny, dying isn't funny, so shut the fuck up!",12,Southpark,136,23,,,,,,,,,
7155,Cartman,1,"Well excuse me, Kyle, for trying to keep some optimism, you know? I mean, sometimes when things... seem their darkest you just need to try and stay... HIV-positive, but if you wanna be so HIV-negative all the time, I-",12,Southpark,217,39,,,,,,,,,
7156,Kyle,1,Knock it off! Right now! This isn't funny! At all!,12,Southpark,50,10,,,,,,,,,
7157,Cartman,1,Are you sure?,12,Southpark,13,3,,,,,,,,,
7158,Kyle,1,Yes!!,12,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
7159,Cartman,1,"Are you HIV-positive?  Aarrhh! Ow, fuck, Kyle!",12,Southpark,46,7,,,,,,,,,
7161,Kyle,1,Well I've been thinking: maybe there's something you've come into contact with that hinders HIV from growing. Do you mind if we just look around?,12,Southpark,145,25,,,,,,,,,
7164,Kyle,1,But everyone tries that. There has to be something you're exposed to that others aren't. Could we see where you sleep?,12,Southpark,118,21,,,,,,,,,
7167,Kyle,1,Dude.,12,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
7169,Kyle,1,You sleep with money. Every night?,12,Southpark,34,6,,,,,,,,,
7175,Kyle,1,"Well look, if being around lots of cash negatively affects the HIV, then maybe...",12,Southpark,81,14,,,,,,,,,
7181,Kyle,1,Wugh.,12,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
7183,Cartman,1,"Yeah well, if there's a chance of being cured of this illness, then Kyle is willing to take that risk.",12,Southpark,102,20,,,,,,,,,
7186,Cartman,1,All right!,12,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,
7194,Kyle,1,Oh stop! We're not friends! He's the one who infected me with AIDS!,12,Southpark,67,13,,,,,,,,,
7196,Cartman,1,"What?! Aw, no!",12,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,
7198,Cartman,1,"What?! Aw, God damn it!  Well I'll tell you this, Kyle. I'm never gettin' my tonsils out again, hahahaha.",12,Southpark,105,19,,,,,,,,,
7199,Kyle,1,I'm still breaking your Xbox. ,12,Southpark,30,5,,,,,,,,,
7200,Cartman,1,"What? No. No.  Kyle, no!",12,Southpark,24,5,,,,,,,,,
7203,Stan,2,"Ugh, Dad, can we please not watch this?",12,Southpark,39,8,,,,,,,,,
7204,Randy,2,"This is important, Stanley!  You boys should care about this stuff.",12,Southpark,67,11,,,,,,,,,
7205,Cartman,2,"Yeah, but we totally don't.",12,Southpark,27,5,,,,,,,,,
7206,Randy,2,Well you boys are gonna sit and watch this! This is what really matters!,12,Southpark,72,14,,,,,,,,,
7210,Butters,2,Man...,12,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,

7223,Kyle,2,A hundred thousand dollars?,12,Southpark,27,4,,,,,,,,,
7224,Cartman,2,That's enough to buy slaves!,12,Southpark,28,5,,,,,,,,,
7227,Kyle,2,Did you guys hear that?! A hundred thousand dollars for a picture of Britney.,12,Southpark,77,14,,,,,,,,,
7228,Stan,2,And she's at a hotel in our town. ,12,Southpark,34,8,,,,,,,,,
7229,Kyle,2,"It's gotta be the Komfort Inn. It's the nicest hotel in South Park. Cartman, go get your camera.",12,Southpark,96,18,,,,,,,,,
7230,Cartman,2,Sweet!,12,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
7231,Butters,2,"Hey, hanguh, hang on, fellas, don't you think Britney's been through enough? I mean, maybe it's finally time for us all to just leave her alone.",12,Southpark,144,26,,,,,,,,,
7232,Stan,2,"Butters, don't be such a pussy.",12,Southpark,31,6,,,,,,,,,
7233,Butters,2,Hokay. ,12,Southpark,7,1,,,,,,,,,
7234,Kyle,2,A hundred thousand for a picture of Britney peeing on a ladybug. Imagine what a photo of her crapping on a squirrel is worth!,12,Southpark,125,24,,,,,,,,,
7235,Butters,2,"Well this costume was supposed to be for the Easter musical, fellas, not for tryin' to make an easy buck! ",12,Southpark,106,20,,,,,,,,,
7236,Stan,2,Oh no.,12,Southpark,6,2,,,,,,,,,
7237,Kyle,2,"Excuse us, we're trying to get a picture of Britney Spears!",12,Southpark,59,11,,,,,,,,,
7240,Cartman,2,"We're professionals too, you fuckin' butthole! ",12,Southpark,47,6,,,,,,,,,
7242,Kyle,2,"We uh, we have special permission?",12,Southpark,34,6,,,,,,,,,
7243,Stan,2,"Yeah, don't you recognize us? We're Britney Spears' kids.",12,Southpark,57,9,,,,,,,,,
7245,Butters,2,Not me! I'm a squirrel!,12,Southpark,23,5,,,,,,,,,
7249,Kyle,2,We did it guys!,12,Southpark,15,4,,,,,,,,,

7266,Butters,2,You killed her! ,12,Southpark,16,3,,,,,,,,,
7269,Stan,2,We should have just left her alone. But we just had to push her.,12,Southpark,64,14,,,,,,,,,
7270,Kyle,2,How could we know she would... Aw we suck so hard.,12,Southpark,50,11,,,,,,,,,

7308,Kyle,2,What?!,12,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
7310,Kyle,2,"Excuse me, is this really what you think she should be doing right now?",12,Southpark,71,14,,,,,,,,,
7314,Stan,2,"Would you put a stop to this, please? This is only gonna make things worse.",12,Southpark,75,15,,,,,,,,,
7320,Stan,2,What do you expect?! Look at her! She doesn't have most of her brain!,12,Southpark,69,14,,,,,,,,,

7331,Stan,2,She doesn't have any lips!,12,Southpark,26,5,,,,,,,,,

7336,Kyle,2,"Dude, where in the world can Britney Spears go where nobody will bother her?",12,Southpark,76,14,,,,,,,,,
7337,Stan,2,I know where.,12,Southpark,13,3,,,,,,,,,
7338,Stan,2,We want three tickets to the North Pole. ,12,Southpark,41,8,,,,,,,,,

7362,Kyle,2,"I'm not Britney Spears, all right?!",12,Southpark,35,6,,,,,,,,,
7365,Kyle,2,"Now, wait a minute! Everyone just stop for one minute!  Look, you guys are gonna end up killing her. Can't you see that Britney isn't in any condition to handle this crap anymore? I know watching celebrities go down can be fun. Me and my friends are just as guilty as all of you, but maybe, we'll just, maybe, ...it's time to let this one go. Just this one time, let's, let's all stop before it's too late, huh?",12,Southpark,411,79,,,,,,,,,

7401,Kyle,2,Corn harvest!,12,Southpark,13,2,,,,,,,,,

7422,Randy,2,Looks like next harvest will be even better. ,12,Southpark,45,8,,,,,,,,,
7424,Kyle,3,You can get high from choking yourself? ,12,Southpark,40,7,,,,,,,,,

7427,Cartman,3,Cat pee? ,12,Southpark,9,2,,,,,,,,,
7428,Stan,3,"That's not true. You can't get high off of cat urine, can you?",12,Southpark,62,13,,,,,,,,,
7430,Cartman,3,"All right, this should keep my cat in place while he spreads the urine.  Yesss, poor Mr. Kitty, are you just so upset right now? ",12,Southpark,129,25,,,,,,,,,

7536,Cartman,3,"Oh oh no no, I cannot possibly take in another.",12,Southpark,47,10,,,,,,,,,
7538,Cartman,3,"I've already taken in the Andersons' cats, and the Willinskys'. There's simply nothinng else I can-  Then again... perhaps I could find space for just this one more...",12,Southpark,167,28,,,,,,,,,

7646,Cartman,4,"God damn it, when are they going to air new Terrance and Phillip shows?!",12,Southpark,72,14,,,,,,,,,

7648,Stan,4,It's not a big deal. We can just watch American comedy. ,12,Southpark,56,11,,,,,,,,,

7674,Kyle,4,The Internet?,12,Southpark,13,2,,,,,,,,,
7676,Stan,4,What'd they say?,12,Southpark,16,3,,,,,,,,,
7677,Kyle,4,They said we have to give them money that we make on the Internet.,12,Southpark,66,14,,,,,,,,,
7678,Cartman,4,How are we supposed to make money on the Internet?,12,Southpark,50,10,,,,,,,,,
7679,Butters,4,"Well, how do other people make money on the Internet?",12,Southpark,53,10,,,,,,,,,
7680,Kyle,4,We'd have to put something up on the Internet that everyone would find fascinating.,12,Southpark,83,14,,,,,,,,,

7718,Butters,4,"""What What ,"" sir.",12,Southpark,18,4,,,,,,,,,
7719,Stan,4,It's Tron Guy. I saw him on YouToob.,12,Southpark,36,8,,,,,,,,,

7748,Kyle,4,"Okay, forget it. We'll wait our turn.",12,Southpark,37,7,,,,,,,,,
7755,Cartman,4,Sweet. I think we're next in line now.,12,Southpark,38,8,,,,,,,,,
7758,Kyle,4,"Okay, we did it.",12,Southpark,16,4,,,,,,,,,
7760,Stan,4,We're the ones you told to get Internet money.,12,Southpark,46,9,,,,,,,,,
7761,Kyle,4,Here.  We made ten million theoretical dollars. It's all for you. ,12,Southpark,66,11,,,,,,,,,
7763,Stan,4,"Hey, we worked really hard to get this theoretical money!",12,Southpark,57,10,,,,,,,,,
7764,Kyle,4,Yeah. Everyone thinks I'm a homo now.,12,Southpark,37,7,,,,,,,,,
7765,Cartman,4,"...You are a homo, Butters.",12,Southpark,27,5,,,,,,,,,
7766,Kyle,4,"Dude, will you just end this thing now?! My little brother is gonna die!",12,Southpark,72,14,,,,,,,,,
7771,Kyle,4,"Hello? Will you just give this guy something, please?!",12,Southpark,54,9,,,,,,,,,
7773,Kyle,4,"He just doesn't wanna look like an idiot, so he wants everyone to think the strike was for something. Just, just give him anything!",12,Southpark,131,24,,,,,,,,,
7775,Kyle,4,"If they give you something small, will you end the strike?",12,Southpark,58,11,,,,,,,,,
7777,Kyle,4,Can you act like you're giving him a lot?,12,Southpark,41,9,,,,,,,,,
7784,Kyle,4,Ike. Ike!  It's over.,12,Southpark,21,4,,,,,,,,,
7786,Kyle,4,Yeah. Here you go. ,12,Southpark,19,4,,,,,,,,,
7787,Stan,4,"Boy, I'm sure glad that's over with.",12,Southpark,36,7,,,,,,,,,
7788,Butters,4,Me too!,12,Southpark,7,2,,,,,,,,,
7789,Kyle,4,"Yeah, but you know, I learned something today. We thought we could make money on the Internet. But, while the Internet is new and exciting for creative people, it hasn't matured as a distribution mechanism to the extent that one should trade real and immediate opportunities for income for the promise of future online revenue. It will be a few years before digital distribution of media on the Internet can be monetized to the extent that necessitates content producers to forgo their fair value in more traditional media.",12,Southpark,523,88,,,,,,,,,
7790,Stan,4,...Yeah.,12,Southpark,8,1,,,,,,,,,
7808,Butters,5,Are we gonna get tested on this?,12,Southpark,32,7,,,,,,,,,
7810,Stan,5,"Dude, wanna do some math problems?",12,Southpark,34,6,,,,,,,,,
7817,Cartman,5,"Oh! Me me, me. Me! Me me! Me! Right here! Right here right here.",12,Southpark,64,14,,,,,,,,,
7819,Cartman,5,Principal Victoria. Right over here. Nnnnnh!,12,Southpark,44,6,,,,,,,,,
7821,Cartman,5,Rrrrrrr! Principal Victoria. Principal.,12,Southpark,39,4,,,,,,,,,
7823,Cartman,5,Yes! ,12,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
7825,Kyle,5,"You're not the teacher, fatass.",12,Southpark,31,5,,,,,,,,,
7826,Cartman,5,"That's Mr. Cartman now, Kyle! And you will be wise not to interrupt my class unless you want to be suspended!  Yeahhh.  Mmm yeah, you like that?  All right, Clyde, you're first! Get up here!  Yeah, you're gonna take it, Clyde. ",12,Southpark,227,41,,,,,,,,,
7839,Cartman,5,Ey! Don't commend me! It's the students' fault for being so stupid!,12,Southpark,67,12,,,,,,,,,
7842,Cartman,5,"Oh, well, thank you. I believe strict discipline along with compassion for my students is catamite to their learning.",12,Southpark,117,19,,,,,,,,,
7846,Cartman,5,That sounds like a chance to really make an impact on some students who need it most. How much will you pay me?,12,Southpark,111,23,,,,,,,,,
7847,Cartman,5,"Three hundred bucks! Did you hear what I said, you guys?! My awesome teaching skill is gonna earn me three. Hundred. Bucks.",12,Southpark,123,22,,,,,,,,,
7848,Kyle,5,You're not an awesome teacher!,12,Southpark,30,5,,,,,,,,,
7849,Cartman,5,Whatever. The whole class scored super-high on the test.,12,Southpark,56,9,,,,,,,,,
7850,Kyle,5,The only reason we scored high was because we took the answers out of Garrison's desk! And you know it!,12,Southpark,103,20,,,,,,,,,
7851,Cartman,5,"Yes, but whose idea was it to take the answers out of Garrison's desk?",12,Southpark,70,14,,,,,,,,,
7852,Kyle,5,Kenny's!,12,Southpark,8,1,,,,,,,,,
7853,Kenny,5,,12,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
7854,Cartman,5,"Oh yeah. But whatever, I'm gonna go teach those underprivileged inner-city students and really turns their lives around.",12,Southpark,120,18,,,,,,,,,
7855,Kyle,5,Do you know what those kids are going to do to you?! A little middle-class white boy telling them what to do? They are going to fucking murder you! ,12,Southpark,148,29,,,,,,,,,
7856,Cartman,5,Maybe he's right. I'd better be careful how I look.,12,Southpark,51,10,,,,,,,,,
7862,Cartman,5,Hello students. I'm Eric Cartmanez.  Your new teacher.,12,Southpark,54,8,,,,,,,,,
7864,Cartman,5,I am here... to teach you calculuuus.,12,Southpark,37,7,,,,,,,,,
7877,Cartman,5,"Okay, everyone take a sillibus and pass it to the amigo behind youuu.",12,Southpark,69,13,,,,,,,,,
7880,Cartman,5,Mr. Cartmanez is here to make sure you all get into collehhhge,12,Southpark,62,12,,,,,,,,,
7882,Cartman,5,"How do I reach these keeds?  The reason that you think you can't get into college is because you haven't been taught... how to cheat properly! How do you think white people always get ahead? Because we cheat all the time- I mean because they cheat all the time.  This is Bill Beelichick, coach of the New England Patriots He's won three Super Bowls. How? He cheated. He even got caught cheating, and nobody cared. Bill Beelichick proved that in America it's okay to cheat. As long as you cheat your way to the top.",12,Southpark,514,95,,,,,,,,,
7884,Cartman,5,"No no. If you cheat and fail, you're a cheater. If you cheat and succeed, you're savvyyy.",12,Southpark,89,17,,,,,,,,,
7886,Cartman,5,"Go ahead, the door's right there.  Bye-bye, have fun, we will miss youuu.  How do I reach these keeds?",12,Southpark,102,19,,,,,,,,,
7888,Kyle,5,What?,12,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
7890,Butters,5,Ow. That hurt my brains.  Oww.,12,Southpark,30,6,,,,,,,,,
7891,Cartman,5,"Nice form, compadre. ",12,Southpark,21,3,,,,,,,,,
7893,Cartman,5,"Who wants to argue on a nice day like theees? How about a little pickup game?  Hey paisanoo, can you keep score for us? ",12,Southpark,120,24,,,,,,,,,
7895,Cartman,5,"Okay, you start on defense, amigo. ",12,Southpark,35,6,,,,,,,,,
7897,Cartman,5,"Ohoooh, that's one to nothing, amigo!",12,Southpark,37,6,,,,,,,,,
7899,Cartman,5,"What's the score, ese? Okay, let's go, your turn.  That's two to nothing, amigoo. ",12,Southpark,82,14,,,,,,,,,
7901,Cartman,5,"Look at the scoreboard, amigo. No matter how many times you say I cheated, the scoreboard says two, nothing. ",12,Southpark,109,19,,,,,,,,,
7903,Cartman,5,"Two to nothing, ese! Two to nothing!  How do I reach these keeds?",12,Southpark,65,13,,,,,,,,,
7915,Butters,5,Hey wait! I think that's teacher's penis!,12,Southpark,41,7,,,,,,,,,
7917,Butters,5,"Yeah, that must be his.",12,Southpark,23,5,,,,,,,,,
7919,Butters,5,Huh?,12,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
7920,Cartman,5,"Today we will discuss one of the fundamental ways to cheat: getting material ahead of time.  When Bill Beelichick cheated for the Patriots, what did he do? He videotaped the opposing team's defense. Think of the defense as your test. When taking a test you must also videotape the defense. Learn what's on the test before they give it to you. And that way you can- ",12,Southpark,365,66,,,,,,,,,
7922,Cartman,5,"Have a seat, amigo. Good to have you baaack.  All right. Now, when Bill Beelichick got caught with his camera, he did not panic. He simply said what every good white cheater says when caught: ""I mis-interpreted the rules."" It's what you must also say when caught cheating! ""I mis-interpreted the rules."" Say it with me.",12,Southpark,319,56,,,,,,,,,
7924,Cartman,5,Good. Again.,12,Southpark,12,2,,,,,,,,,
7926,Cartman,5,Again!,12,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
7928,Cartman,5,Now you sound like white people!,12,Southpark,32,6,,,,,,,,,
7943,Cartman,5,The answer to #27 is 5.,12,Southpark,23,6,,,,,,,,,
7945,Cartman,5,The answer to #28 is 14.,12,Southpark,24,6,,,,,,,,,
7948,Cartman,5,"All right, uh, everyone review the section on sportscasters forgiving the Patriots for cheating and saying it was no big deal; I'll be right back.  Melita! Melita, hold on.  You can't quit now. Come on, what's wrong with you?",12,Southpark,225,39,,,,,,,,,
7950,Cartman,5,"How do I reach these keeds?  All right, let's go get you an abortion.",12,Southpark,69,14,,,,,,,,,
7952,Cartman,5,Abortion isn't wrong! What's the one thing I've been teaching you?,12,Southpark,66,11,,,,,,,,,
7954,Cartman,5,"Yes! And abortion is the ultimate form of chea-ting! You're chea-ting nature itself.  Why do rich white girls get ahead in life? Because they get abortionnns when they're young. They get pregnant, but they still want to go to college, so, whatever, they just cheat. They cheat that little critter in their belly right out of a chance at life.",12,Southpark,342,60,,,,,,,,,
7956,Cartman,5,"Mexicans are told not to cheat. ""Don't cheat! You got pregnant? You have to raise the child."" So then you have to raise the child while the white girls get to go to college and probably have a bunch more abortionnns.  It is at our most challenging times that we must cheat... our very hardest.",12,Southpark,293,55,,,,,,,,,
7977,Chef,5,What'sa that peenis doing ina myii kitchen? ,12,Southpark,44,7,,,,,,,,,
7989,Cartman,5,Uh what?,12,Southpark,8,2,,,,,,,,,
7994,Cartman,5,"Ih it's not for nothing. Ih, if you're good enough, you can cheat right in front of them.",12,Southpark,89,18,,,,,,,,,
7996,Cartman,5,"How do I reeeach these keeeeds?!  Just before the last Super Bowl, Bill Beelichick gathered his football players and said, ""Let's win this one for real. Just this one time. Let's not cheat."" You know what happened?  They lost.  Even if you feel all eyes are upon you, you cannot give up on chea-ting! Or else you can lose the biggest game of your lives.",12,Southpark,353,65,,,,,,,,,
7998,Cartman,5,You are the true dreamers. Tomorrow you will prove it. We will begin by reviewing how to print out cheat sheets as labels for your bottled water.,12,Southpark,145,27,,,,,,,,,

8006,Mr. Garrison,5,"Thanks everyone. It's great to be back. I'm a man again. Thanks to my very special new friend.  But you know, I've learned that I've really been a dude all along.

8162,Randy,6,"You don't understand.  I need the Internet to jack off. I... got used to being able to see anything at the click of a button, you know? Once you jack off to Japanese girls puking in each other's mouths you can't exactly go back to Playboy!",12,Southpark,239,46,,,,,,,,,
8164,Randy,6,Three minutes would be plenty.,12,Southpark,30,5,,,,,,,,,

8215,Randy,6,"Oh no it wasn't me, it was this spooky ghost! ",12,Southpark,46,10,,,,,,,,,
8239,Randy,6,"And so what have we learned through this ordeal? The Internet went away. It came back. But for how long we do not know. We cannot take the Internet for granted any longer. We as a country must stop over-logging -on. We must use the Internet only when we need it. It's easy for us to think we can just use up all the Internet we want. But if we don't treat the Internet with the resPECT  that it deserves, it could one day be gone forever. So let us learn to live with the Internet, not for it. No more browsing for no apparent reason, no more mindlessly surfing on our laptops while watching television. And finally,  We must learn to only use the Internet for porn twice a day. Max.

8426,Butters,7,That looks dangerous.,12,Southpark,21,3,,,,,,,,,
8427,Cartman,7,"Not getting busted always is, Butters. Come on.  Good, that's good.  That's good, Good, all right then. Let's head across.  Go easy. Good.",12,Southpark,138,23,,,,,,,,,

8784,Cartman,8,"I really don't care anymore, Butters. You see, I've learned something today. As Americans our fear of seeing another country become powerful can turn us into monsters. Watching how crazy you went. Watching you just... shoot people in the dick like that. It made me realize that I want America to be safe, but not at the cost of losing its dignity. I'd rather us be... Chinese... than a nation of unethical dickshooters.  You think about it. ",12,Southpark,441,77,,,,,,,,,

8890,Cartman,9,"Nu-no, she doesn't. She told me she doesn't wanna fight. She's just stuck, Stan. Because she knows I'm gonna kick her ass, but she feels like if she doesn't fight me all the kids are gonna call her a chicken.",12,Southpark,208,40,,,,,,,,,
8891,Stan,9,Really?,12,Southpark,7,1,,,,,,,,,
8892,Cartman,9,"You know what she did? She apologized and begged me not to fight her. I said ""Well Wendy, if you're so sorry, then say it in front of everyone."" But she wouldn't. That's how desperate she is. Man you have to do something, Stan. You have to be a fuckin' man and forbid her from fighting, so she has a way-  Oh, that's where I put those.  Anyway, Stan, you've got to put a stop to this fight. Wendy's stuck and she needs you.",12,Southpark,423,84,,,,,,,,,

9231,Stan,10,"All right, fine, Craig. When we get back home we'll get you your money back, and we'll never talk to you again. How's that?",12,Southpark,123,24,,,,,,,,,
9233,Kyle,10,This is wrong. Uh this just doesn't make any sense. Why would Homeland Security send us into Peru?,12,Southpark,98,18,,,,,,,,,

9282,Randy,11,"I've got the video camera. Got it turned on again.  Okay. This is... Randy Marsh... I'm shooting this video of myself. Twenty minutes ago some... huge creatures attacked our town...

9293,Randy,11,Gotta get out!,12,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,
9295,Stan,11,"Ah all right, just let me get this straight: the head of Homeland Security ordered you to fly us, five kids, to Peru, but had you land way up in the Andes Mountains of Peru so that other government people could meet us and then... somehow tell us how to go to the capital of Peru, way over in Lima, and take down their government.",12,Southpark,330,65,,,,,,,,,
9297,Kyle,11,And that makes sense to you?,12,Southpark,28,6,,,,,,,,,
9300,Stan,11,"None of what that Homeland Security guy does make sense, so could you just fly us home, please?!",12,Southpark,96,18,,,,,,,,,
9303,Kyle,11,So we've gotta find another way out of here.,12,Southpark,44,9,,,,,,,,,
9306,Cartman,11,"You know what, we're getting pretty sick of your attitude, Craig.",12,Southpark,65,11,,,,,,,,,
9307,Kenny,11,,12,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
9308,Cartman,11,Nobody likes hanging out with people who complain all the time.,12,Southpark,63,11,,,,,,,,,
9317,Randy,11,"Hey we're down in... Main Street now and...  Wah? Oh, ohh, look at that.  Ohhh!",12,Southpark,79,15,,,,,,,,,
9319,Randy,11,We've got to get out of town. Go through that way. ,12,Southpark,51,11,,,,,,,,,

9325,Randy,11,"In there, in there!  Oh God, oh God I'm so startled. Are you startled, Sharon?",12,Southpark,78,15,,,,,,,,,
9329,Randy,11,"Hold on, hold on, I need to get a shot of it from outside. ",12,Southpark,59,14,,,,,,,,,

The jobs started drying up. Then the stores had to shut down.  Then a black man was elected President. He was supposed to change things.  He didn't.  As more and more people turned to crime and violence the town becomes gripped in fear. Dark times. The city needs protection.  There is an animal that lives by night, searches the trashcans and cleans out the garbage.  To clean out the trashcan of society I've chosen to become more than a man.  I'm the hero this town needs. I am...  the Coon!  As the world plummets into despair the Coon fights to keep order intact. ",13,Southpark,747,133,,,,,,,,,

Why does he sacrifice himself every night to rid our streets of crime? And does he really have the right?"" What we all need now-  Clyde? Clyde, could you wake up please? This is important.

It goes back to when the government had the idea that everyone in America deserves to own a house. So we have people having a hard time paying their loans,  meaning less money coming in.  And the idiots couldn't see that by doing all this frivolous spending they were mocking the Economy. And they made the Economy very angry.

10828,Kyle,3,"Now look! The reason we're in this situation is because people are being stupid! The economy isn't some vengeful being that takes things away from us. The economy is just made up of people, and people have just lost their faith in it.  What people really should be doing is spending more. Spending is fine. People should just go outside. People should just go outside. They should buy the things they need for their friends and family",13,Southpark,434,77,,,,,,,,,

10880,Stan,3,Aargh! ,13,Southpark,7,1,,,,,,,,,
10881,Kyle,3,"Listen, this is all you need to know: the economy is not a supernatural all-knowing entity. The economy is just an idea, made up by people, thousands of years ago. The economy is not real. And yet, it is real. Nowadays they'll give credit to practically anyone who applies for them.  I applied for this yesterday to prove a point. It is an American Express Platinum card.  It has no spending limit.  Do not be afraid! This is only plastic. It's just something made up by people. Truly meaningless until we put our faith in it. Faith is what makes an economy exist. Without faith, it is only plastic cards and paper money.",13,Southpark,621,113,,,,,,,,,
10883,Randy,3,"We've done everything we can and yet the Economy has not improved. Worse, it has declined! Poor Bart here just lost his job at Little Caesar's Pizza. Our tireless work is obviously being undermined by this one Jew. Why does he go around pretending to know the true will of the Economy?",13,Southpark,285,52,,,,,,,,,
10886,Randy,3,"That is stupid, yea. And going around telling people to shop... is dangerous!",13,Southpark,77,13,,,,,,,,,

10892,Stan,3,I want to return this Margaritaville! My dad bought it on a payment plan set up by a finance company that got investors from Wall Street who combined it into securities sold to the banks who transferred it to you!,13,Southpark,213,40,,,,,,,,,

10902,Butters,3,Well don't worry Kyle. We're not gonna let people kill you. We'll keep you hidden forever!,13,Southpark,90,16,,,,,,,,,

11296,Cartman,5,"Jimmy, dude, did you see?! Carlos Mencia is taking credit for our joke!",13,Southpark,71,13,,,,,,,,,
11298,Cartman,5,"Yeah dude. I told you this would happen. Now look, I got a lawyer to draw up some patent papers. We've got to sign these so that people know that the joke belongs to you and me!",13,Southpark,177,37,,,,,,,,,
11300,Cartman,5,"But Jimmy, some fat turd is taking credit for something he didn't do!",13,Southpark,69,13,,,,,,,,,
11302,Cartman,5,What?!,13,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
11304,Cartman,5,"Jimmy, that's messed up. We decided that day to write together. Don't you remember?",13,Southpark,83,14,,,,,,,,,
11305,Cartman,5,"Hey Jimmy, wanna hang out?",13,Southpark,26,5,,,,,,,,,
11307,Cartman,5,"Team up? Okay, let's write some jokes together.",13,Southpark,47,8,,,,,,,,,
11309,Cartman,5,"Do we like fishsticks? What does she think we are? Gay fish?  Uh oh, look out, Jimmy, it's a black widow! ",13,Southpark,106,21,,,,,,,,,
11312,Cartman,5,"Look, exactly who came up with which part of the joke isn't even relevant. We had an agreement Jimmy. And if you wanna go back on that now, well then you're no better than a Jew.",13,Southpark,178,36,,,,,,,,,
11314,Cartman,5,"It's cool man, it's cool. ",13,Southpark,26,5,,,,,,,,,
11326,Cartman,5,"Hey Kyle, can I talk to you for a second?",13,Southpark,41,10,,,,,,,,,
11327,Kyle,5,"Dude, get out of here! I'm peeing.",13,Southpark,34,7,,,,,,,,,
11328,Cartman,5,"It's just... I don't know what to do about Jimmy. I'm starting to think he might try and Jew me out of my half of the fishsticks joke.  I just... need you to teach me some Jew defensive moves, Kyle. Because we really both did come up with it. ",13,Southpark,243,49,,,,,,,,,
11329,Kyle,5,"You know what, Cartman? I believe you.",13,Southpark,38,7,,,,,,,,,
11330,Cartman,5,You do?,13,Southpark,7,2,,,,,,,,,
11331,Kyle,5,"Yes, I believe that you believe you helped write that joke. That's how people like you work! Your ego is so out of whack that it will do whatever it can to protect itself. And people with a messed up ego can do these mental gymnastics to convince themselves they're awesome, when really, they're just douchebags! ",13,Southpark,313,56,,,,,,,,,
11332,Cartman,5,"But, I'm sure I helped come up with the joke. Didn't I?",13,Southpark,55,12,,,,,,,,,
11333,Cartman,5,"Hey Jimmy, what's up dawg?",13,Southpark,26,5,,,,,,,,,
11335,Cartman,5,That's cool. You wanna write some together? ,13,Southpark,44,7,,,,,,,,,
11337,Cartman,5,"Cool, thanks. Let's get to work! Now let's see... something that's a play on words, I don't know... fishsticks. You know, 'cause it, 'cause dicks",13,Southpark,145,25,,,,,,,,,
11340,Cartman,5,"Oh thank you Mrs. Valmer.  Now let's see... The setup could be... ""Do you like fishsticks?""",13,Southpark,91,16,,,,,,,,,
11342,Cartman,5,"So then I can say, ""What are you, a gay fish?""",13,Southpark,46,11,,,,,,,,,
11345,Cartman,5,"It's a dragon of some kind! Don't worry, I can save you all! ",13,Southpark,61,13,,,,,,,,,
11346,Butters,5,"Hey look, Eric killed a dragon.",13,Southpark,31,6,,,,,,,,,
11349,Cartman,5,Thanks you guys!,13,Southpark,16,3,,,,,,,,,
11350,Cartman,5,"Nnnope. No, I definitely helped write the joke. All I can hope is Jimmy doesn't try and Jew me over.",13,Southpark,100,20,,,,,,,,,
11367,Cartman,5,"Hi Ellen.  Do you guys like fishsticks?  Thank you, thank you. No, really. Thank you.",13,Southpark,85,15,,,,,,,,,
11370,Cartman,5,"Ellen, comedy is like a game of racquetball, you know? You serve, and the other person hits it back. It bounces off the wall, you backhand it. And it goes back and forth and back and forth and then hopefully you've got a good joke. Thank you.",13,Southpark,242,47,,,,,,,,,
11373,Cartman,5,Truth of the matter is that there has never really been a team like us before. I mean let's be perfectly honest: a lot of people wouldn't work with someone who's disabled. But I see past that. I look beyond Jimmy's disabilities and find ...a bond which can unite us in comedy. Working with crippled people is really ...important. ,13,Southpark,330,59,,,,,,,,,
11376,Cartman,5,"Ahaw don't cry, pal. You're gonna get me started. Anyway, what was really important for us as a team, Ellen, was to make sure that everyone knew that we came up with the joke, and not Carlos Butthole Mencia.",13,Southpark,207,39,,,,,,,,,
11378,Cartman,5,Uhhh excuse me? ,13,Southpark,16,3,,,,,,,,,
11380,Cartman,5,"Alright, so check it out: We've got offers from Van de Kamp's and Gorton's Fisherman to do commercials.",13,Southpark,103,18,,,,,,,,,
11382,Cartman,5,"Yeah, that was kewl huh?",13,Southpark,24,5,,,,,,,,,
11384,Cartman,5,Whassat?,13,Southpark,8,1,,,,,,,,,
11386,Cartman,5,So... here it is.,13,Southpark,17,4,,,,,,,,,
11388,Cartman,5,"That is bullcrap Jimmy, and you know it! I had just as much to do with the fishsticks joke as you did!  Dude, it's Puff Daddy!",13,Southpark,126,26,,,,,,,,,
11393,Cartman,5,"Oh, so now it's we, huh Jimmy? A minute ago you said you did it all yourself!",13,Southpark,77,17,,,,,,,,,
11395,Cartman,5,"Abebeh, abebebebebeah! We both came up with it together! You wanna know how it happened?!",13,Southpark,89,15,,,,,,,,,
11396,Cartman,5,Hello Jim.,13,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,
11398,Cartman,5,What are you up to?,13,Southpark,19,5,,,,,,,,,
11400,Cartman,5,"Well, maybe I can help you. We can team up. ",13,Southpark,44,10,,,,,,,,,
11402,Cartman,5,"Now let's see, how about a joke that has something to do with... fishsticks. You know, 'cause fishsticks sounds like fish dicks, Jimmy.",13,Southpark,135,23,,,,,,,,,
11404,Cartman,5,"Thanks.  So, what I'm thinking is, ""Do you like fishsticks in your mouth?"" ",13,Southpark,75,13,,,,,,,,,
11406,Butters,5,"Eric! Eric, you have to save us! An entire army of Jew robots! ",13,Southpark,63,13,,,,,,,,,
11407,Cartman,5,"Oh my God, what are Jewbots doing here?  Flame on!  Flame off! ",13,Southpark,63,12,,,,,,,,,
11409,Cartman,5,"Come on, Jimmy, we gotta go back and finish that joke!  ""Like fishsticks in your mouth? What are you a gay fish?"" There! ",13,Southpark,121,23,,,,,,,,,
11411,Cartman,5,Aw dammit! I guess it really was all me who came up with it.,13,Southpark,60,14,,,,,,,,,
11413,Cartman,5,"You've gotta let Jimmy go, it's all my fault.",13,Southpark,45,9,,,,,,,,,
11415,Cartman,5,"Jimmy, you really believe that you came up with it all on your own? Oh my God, wait. I totally get it now.",13,Southpark,106,23,,,,,,,,,
11417,Cartman,5,"All this time I've been mad at you, Jimmy, for trying to take all the credit, but, now I realize it's just that your ego has made you believe things happened differently. That's what Kyle was trying to tell me. That you have such a huge ego you do these mental gymnastics to make yourself a part of things.",13,Southpark,306,59,,,,,,,,,
11419,Cartman,5,"I thought you were just trying to Jew me out of my part of the credit, but now I realize that... some people just have egos that are so out of whack that no matter what people tell them, they can't accept the truth of who they are.  Jimmy, I owe you an apology. I realize now you can't help believing you created the entire joke, because your ego won't let you think otherwise. I just have to accept that.",13,Southpark,405,80,,,,,,,,,
11425,Randy,6,"Alright,  that's 2.8 centimeters... should give us a drag of only.. 26 milliseconds. Hold the front here, Stan. ",13,Southpark,112,18,,,,,,,,,
11427,Randy,6,We know!,13,Southpark,8,2,,,,,,,,,
11429,Randy,6,"Sharon, Stan's Pinewood Derby race is tomorrow! Do you have any idea how important this is to him? Stan is not gonna lose to the goddamn Hollises again!",13,Southpark,152,28,,,,,,,,,
11431,Randy,6,"That's 'cause you're a chick! Now just leave us alone!  Don't worry, son, the Hollises are not beating us this year! I went and got something to put inside our car and make it go extra-fast. ",13,Southpark,191,36,,,,,,,,,
11432,Stan,6,"Dad, we're not allowed to add anything to the car that doesn't come in the approved kit, remember?",13,Southpark,98,18,,,,,,,,,
11433,Randy,6,"Stan, how do you think the Hollises beat us every year?  I'm sure they put lead in the wood or something; we're just leveling the playing field.  There.",13,Southpark,152,28,,,,,,,,,
11434,Stan,6,What is that?,13,Southpark,13,3,,,,,,,,,
11435,Randy,6,"It's, uh it's nothing, really.",13,Southpark,30,5,,,,,,,,,
11437,Stan,6,"Oh no, he didn't.",13,Southpark,17,4,,,,,,,,,
11441,Randy,6,"Alright Stan, we're gonna need to check in and have our car inspected to qualify.  Now, son, Daddy needs to teach you something very important about ""tells.""",13,Southpark,157,27,,,,,,,,,
11442,Stan,6,Tells?,13,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
11443,Randy,6,"When you tell them you only used the approved kit, don't look up and away, don't rub your neck, and don't touch your ear. Otherwise they'll know you're lying to them. Alright? Whenever you need to lie, just don't look up and away, rub your neck, or touch your ear.",13,Southpark,264,50,,,,,,,,,
11444,Stan,6,"Dad, maybe we should just take out the thing you put in the car an-",13,Southpark,67,15,,,,,,,,,
11445,Randy,6,"Son. ...You have to learn how to lie correctly someday, might as well be today, alright? I love you, son. ",13,Southpark,106,20,,,,,,,,,
11447,Stan,6,"It's uh, Marsh. ",13,Southpark,16,3,,,,,,,,,
11449,Randy,6,"Yes I do, yes I do.",13,Southpark,19,6,,,,,,,,,
11450,Stan,6,Yes I do.,13,Southpark,9,3,,,,,,,,,
11452,Randy,6,Oh! Yes! ,13,Southpark,9,2,,,,,,,,,
11454,Randy,6,"Ey Hollis. You, uh, you guys race already?",13,Southpark,42,8,,,,,,,,,
11456,Randy,6,One point five?,13,Southpark,15,3,,,,,,,,,
11459,Randy,6,"Come on, Stan, you can do this! ",13,Southpark,32,7,,,,,,,,,
11462,Randy,6,"Oh yeah!  Oh yeah!  Suck on that, Hollis!",13,Southpark,41,8,,,,,,,,,
11467,Stan,6,Yeah?,13,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
11469,Stan,6,"Aw crap, Dad! ",13,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,
11471,Stan,6,Alien?,13,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
11473,Stan,6,What does it want?,13,Southpark,18,4,,,,,,,,,
11475,Randy,6,"Stan, did you use all the damned toilet paper agai-?  Aw crap!  What?! What do you guys want?! We said we only used what was in the kit! You got nothin' on us! You got nothin' on us!",13,Southpark,182,38,,,,,,,,,
11476,Stan,6,Dad they aren't here for that.,13,Southpark,30,6,,,,,,,,,
11477,Randy,6,"Oh. Hi, I'm Randy Marsh.",13,Southpark,24,5,,,,,,,,,
11479,Randy,6,"What?  Hey, hey Sharon.",13,Southpark,23,4,,,,,,,,,
11481,Randy,6,"So, so guess what? Our Pinewood Derby car found alien life in space.",13,Southpark,68,13,,,,,,,,,
11483,Randy,6,"Yeah, but I guess it's just a dumb little race like you said, huh Sharon?",13,Southpark,73,15,,,,,,,,,
11486,Randy,6,Hullo?,13,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
11491,Randy,6,"Oh okay uh, uh stand by I- I think it's, I think it's landing. ",13,Southpark,63,14,,,,,,,,,
11494,Randy,6,"That's ours, Mr. Alien. We are the Marshes, Randy and Stan.",13,Southpark,59,11,,,,,,,,,
11496,Randy,6,He's got a gun!,13,Southpark,15,4,,,,,,,,,
11500,Randy,6,What do you want?,13,Southpark,17,4,,,,,,,,,
11505,Randy,6,"Uh, yeah. Yeah, that's all we need, huh Stan?  Oh boy.",13,Southpark,54,11,,,,,,,,,
11506,Randy,6,"Okay, let's ah put the wheels on now, son.",13,Southpark,42,9,,,,,,,,,
11509,Randy,6,We're working on it! ,13,Southpark,21,4,,,,,,,,,
11510,Stan,6,"Dad. Dad, you know we can't make the car go as fast as before with only the approved Pinewood Derby kit.",13,Southpark,104,21,,,,,,,,,
11511,Randy,6,"Yeah, thanks Stan, I know that.",13,Southpark,31,6,,,,,,,,,
11512,Stan,6,Well we have to tell them we used something outside the kit.,13,Southpark,60,12,,,,,,,,,
11513,Randy,6,Do you have any idea how stupid that would make us look?!,13,Southpark,57,12,,,,,,,,,
11515,Randy,6,Hello?,13,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
11518,Randy,6,Will you just give us a minute?! Gau!!,13,Southpark,38,8,,,,,,,,,
11519,Stan,6,"Come on, Dad. We've gotta come clean.",13,Southpark,37,7,,,,,,,,,
11520,Randy,6,Awhuh. ,13,Southpark,7,1,,,,,,,,,
11522,Randy,6,What?! ,13,Southpark,7,1,,,,,,,,,
11525,Randy,6,"Uh, no.  We haven't seen anything.",13,Southpark,34,6,,,,,,,,,
11527,Randy,6,"Ahhh actually I- I happen to be on the phone with all the world leaders- I- I can ask. Uh yeah, listen, these, uh, police aliens are here, and they're wondering if anyone's seen an alien named Baby Fark McGee-zax.",13,Southpark,213,40,,,,,,,,,
11530,Randy,6,"Sorry, nobody in the world has seen anything. Uh... what did this... criminal alien do, exactly?",13,Southpark,96,16,,,,,,,,,
11532,Randy,6,"No, we're sure.",13,Southpark,15,3,,,,,,,,,
11534,Randy,6,"That's right, yep, you're the first ones.",13,Southpark,41,7,,,,,,,,,
11536,Randy,6,"...Uh. That's r-. That's right!  Oh, oh my God! Hey everybody, we just made first contact!",13,Southpark,90,16,,,,,,,,,
11538,Randy,6,We will give you a call!,13,Southpark,24,6,,,,,,,,,
11543,Randy,6,"Alright son, now you just paint the racing stripe like you did before.",13,Southpark,70,13,,,,,,,,,
11545,Randy,6,"Hey, the right paint job is a big part of what makes a Pinewood Derby car go fast!",13,Southpark,82,18,,,,,,,,,
11548,Stan,6,"Dad, it's over. We have to tell everyone we cheated.",13,Southpark,52,10,,,,,,,,,
11549,Randy,6,"No. I've got it all figured out, son. You have to kill the alien.",13,Southpark,65,14,,,,,,,,,
11550,Stan,6,Kill the alien?,13,Southpark,15,3,,,,,,,,,
11551,Randy,6,"Sshh! I've been filing down this piece of metal into a shank. I'm gonna call him over here to look at the car, and when I do, you shove that in his neck.",13,Southpark,153,33,,,,,,,,,
11552,Stan,6,"No. Dad, we don't even know what'll happen.",13,Southpark,43,8,,,,,,,,,
11554,Randy,6,"Oh no, that's uh that's it. We're done. Uh here. Come, come take a look.",13,Southpark,72,15,,,,,,,,,
11555,Stan,6,Dad? ,13,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
11556,Randy,6,"Here, see? Here look, look real close at the axles here.  Yeahaah! Ahalright, you got him son!",13,Southpark,94,17,,,,,,,,,
11558,Randy,6,You see Stan? What did Daddy tell you? Everything worked out.,13,Southpark,61,11,,,,,,,,,
11559,Stan,6,I guess so. It just still doesn't feel right.,13,Southpark,45,9,,,,,,,,,
11560,Randy,6,"But Stan, it's over now. We'll never have to lie again.",13,Southpark,55,11,,,,,,,,,
11563,Randy,6,Oh my God. Spaaace caaash. ,13,Southpark,27,5,,,,,,,,,
11565,Randy,6,Right.  But what if we didn't call the cops?,13,Southpark,44,9,,,,,,,,,
11567,Randy,6,"Well I mean...  this is a lot of space cash, guys. Think o'what we could do with it.",13,Southpark,84,18,,,,,,,,,
11568,Stan,6,"No, Dad-",13,Southpark,8,2,,,,,,,,,
11569,Mr. Garrison,6,He's right. We don't have to call the police back.,13,Southpark,50,10,,,,,,,,,
11571,Stan,6,"Whoawhoawhoa Dad, what are we doing?",13,Southpark,36,6,,,,,,,,,
11572,Randy,6,"Will you relax, Stan? ",13,Southpark,22,4,,,,,,,,,
11576,Randy,6,"Alright, fine, look: there's plenty of space cash to go around!  Thanks to us, our planet is rich, son! ",13,Southpark,104,19,,,,,,,,,
11577,Randy,6,"Oh no, China, we get to keep the ship. Because we killed the alien, you boner! Oh-oh come on England, you got just as much of the space cash as everyone else!  Oh crap it's the cops! Hang on.  Ah hey, space officers.",13,Southpark,216,43,,,,,,,,,
11579,Randy,6,"Oh, that- You were talking about that alien. Oh yeah that one, he was here, yeah. He landed here, but we... we killed him.",13,Southpark,122,24,,,,,,,,,
11581,Randy,6,Nnno. Space cash? No.  There wasn't any space cash.,13,Southpark,51,9,,,,,,,,,
11583,Randy,6,"Hey ah ah, any of you other countries see any space cash?",13,Southpark,57,12,,,,,,,,,
11588,Randy,6,"Yeah, it doesn't look like the space cash was ever here.",13,Southpark,56,11,,,,,,,,,
11590,Randy,6,Probably.,13,Southpark,9,1,,,,,,,,,
11592,Randy,6,"Oh... Yeah, Mexico. You know oh, oh, yeah. All of us other countries chipped in and uh, gave Mexico some aid. Yeah they really needed... some new water parks.",13,Southpark,158,29,,,,,,,,,
11594,Randy,6,Hey. Hey Mexico! We said no spending the space cash yet!  What the hell are you doing?! Will some country that speaks Spanish yell at Mexico please? They're gonna ruin everything!,13,Southpark,179,31,,,,,,,,,
11595,Randy,6,"No, Japan! Will you listen to me for five seconds?! If you keep building giant robots the cops are gonna ask questions!",13,Southpark,119,22,,,,,,,,,
11597,Randy,6,Nobody can build anything!!,13,Southpark,27,4,,,,,,,,,
11599,Randy,6,Wha?! Finland?! ,13,Southpark,16,2,,,,,,,,,
11601,Randy,6,"Will you just relax, Finland?! Nobody is gonna find out anything.",13,Southpark,65,11,,,,,,,,,
11603,Randy,6,"Okay okay!  You're right. You're right, Finland! Okay? You're right. Can you just... let us other countries talk pr-private, for a moment?",13,Southpark,138,22,,,,,,,,,
11605,Randy,6,"All right you guys, we've gotta get rid of Finland.",13,Southpark,51,10,,,,,,,,,
11608,Randy,6,Oh dammit!,13,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,
11609,Randy,6,"Uh hey, space officers. How can we help you?",13,Southpark,44,9,,,,,,,,,
11611,Randy,6,Whaa-wha-what about it,13,Southpark,22,3,,,,,,,,,
11613,Randy,6,"Whaaat? Oh my God, not Finland.",13,Southpark,31,6,,,,,,,,,
11615,Randy,6,"Hey guys, Finland's dead.",13,Southpark,25,4,,,,,,,,,
11619,Randy,6,"Yeah, somebody better break the news to Norway; they were really close.",13,Southpark,71,12,,,,,,,,,
11621,Randy,6,"No, I mean... Odds are, they nuked themselves. You know, suicide.",13,Southpark,65,11,,,,,,,,,
11623,Randy,6,"Or, or whatever they did, I'm sayin'.",13,Southpark,37,7,,,,,,,,,
11624,Stan,6,"'Scuse me! 'Scuse me!  Everyone, I have an announcement to make. I'm giving back my Pinewood Derby trophy! ",13,Southpark,107,18,,,,,,,,,
11626,Randy,6,Stan?,13,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
11627,Stan,6,"The truth is, I don't deserve this trophy. 'Cause I cheated on my Pinewood Derby car. I used something not in the approved kit. ",13,Southpark,128,24,,,,,,,,,
11630,Stan,6,"This trophy isn't mine, and so I have to give it back! Because if I'm not honest now, then I'll have to keep this lie going forever. And it will just grow and grow. ",13,Southpark,165,34,,,,,,,,,
11631,Randy,6,"Well Stan, we're proud of you for coming clean. But it doesn't change the fact that you cheated. Go to your room, son.",13,Southpark,118,23,,,,,,,,,
11633,Randy,6,"Hey uh, do we have anything else to tell the space cops?",13,Southpark,56,12,,,,,,,,,
11642,Randy,6,"Yeah, no, we've told you everything.",13,Southpark,36,6,,,,,,,,,
11644,Randy,6,"Aw shit, it's Baby Fark McGee-zax!",13,Southpark,34,6,,,,,,,,,
11648,Randy,6,It was... a trick?,13,Southpark,18,4,,,,,,,,,
11651,Randy,6,"No heywaitwait, no!  Well that sucks!",13,Southpark,37,6,,,,,,,,,
11652,Cartman,7,You guys! You guys! We can finally do it! We can finally leave this crappy town and live the life we've all dreamed of!,13,Southpark,119,24,,,,,,,,,
11653,Butters,7,We can?,13,Southpark,7,2,,,,,,,,,
11654,Stan,7,"What are you talking about, dude?",13,Southpark,33,6,,,,,,,,,
11655,Cartman,7,"Haven't you assholes been watching the news?  Pirating is back, my friends. Swashbuckling adventure on the high seas! The stuff we've all dreamed about! And it's all happening right here:  Somalia.",13,Southpark,197,31,,,,,,,,,
11657,Cartman,7,"North Africa. Just picture it, guys: clear blue water with skull islands. Waterfalls and jeweled treasure underneath.",13,Southpark,117,17,,,,,,,,,
11658,Butters,7,Whoa.,13,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
11659,Cartman,7,"I've worked it all out on Expedia.  We can take Southwest Airlines to Miami, then Dubai Air here to Cairo, and then it's just a 49-hour bus ride into Mogadishu, with all the booty and plunder a pirate could want.",13,Southpark,212,40,,,,,,,,,
11660,Kyle,7,"Wow, you know, Cartman? That is an awesome idea. You should totally go to Somalia.",13,Southpark,82,15,,,,,,,,,

11827,Cartman,7,"Or are you lying now? So many lies, Kyle, you can't even keep them straight. You just couldn't stand that we were living in paradise while you were back home.",13,Southpark,158,30,,,,,,,,,
11828,Kyle,7,"This isn't paradise and you know it! The people here are starving and dying! The whole world has used Somalia as a dumping ground for toxic waste. Even the fish here are radioactive!  Cartman, just give me my brother  and let us get out of here!",13,Southpark,245,46,,,,,,,,,

11854,Butters,7,"Me and Ike, well, we've been talkin' and, well guys, we really had it pretty good back in America. I mean, sure, it's easy to think our lives are boring and full of rules, but a lot of people have it way worse. The pirate's life isn't a life of fun and adventure, it's a life of hardship and suffering. When you get down to it, well we were pretty lucky to have the lives we did.

11896,Cartman,8,HA! What a dumbass! ,13,Southpark,20,4,,,,,,,,,
11897,Kyle,8,"I don't know. Last night we found him hiding in the kitchen pantry. He was screaming the name ""Billy Mays"" over and over again.",13,Southpark,127,24,,,,,,,,,
11898,Cartman,8,"Billy Mays? Billy Mays?!  Dude, you didn't tell us Ike was seeing Billy Mays!",13,Southpark,77,14,,,,,,,,,
11899,Kyle,8,What?,13,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
11900,Cartman,8,Your little brother saw the ghost of Billy Mays?,13,Southpark,48,9,,,,,,,,,
11901,Stan,8,"Dude, I don't even know who that is.",13,Southpark,36,8,,,,,,,,,
11902,Cartman,8,"The guy on TV who had incredible things for people to buy? He died four months ago but they still show his commercials all the time? Oh, oh for the love of Christ, here!  Here here! This, this is him!",13,Southpark,200,40,,,,,,,,,
11908,Cartman,8,That product changed my life. It really works. I use it all the time.,13,Southpark,69,14,,,,,,,,,
11909,Kyle,8,What?! Are you serious?!,13,Southpark,24,4,,,,,,,,,
11910,Cartman,8,"Look Kyle, if there's even a chance that Billy Mays' soul is not at rest, then I wanna help however I can.",13,Southpark,106,22,,,,,,,,,
11911,Kyle,8,"Dude, why the hell would you DO that?!",13,Southpark,38,8,,,,,,,,,
11912,Cartman,8,"Because he was a great person, Kyle.",13,Southpark,36,7,,,,,,,,,

11947,Kyle,8,I just... don't understand it.,13,Southpark,30,5,,,,,,,,,
11948,Stan,8,"It's gonna be alright, Kyle.",13,Southpark,28,5,,,,,,,,,
11949,Kyle,8,"But, dude this doesn't make any sense. I mean, if you know it's going to make you crap blood, why wouldn't you at least just try eating less of it?",13,Southpark,147,30,,,,,,,,,
11950,Cartman,8,"Because, dude, that's what I'm saying. You have the Chipotlaway so it doesn't matter.",13,Southpark,85,14,,,,,,,,,
11951,Kyle,8,"But of course it matters, because you should be concerned there's blood in your underwear.  Do you understand this?",13,Southpark,115,19,,,,,,,,,
11952,Stan,8,"Dude, I don't understand at all. I eat Chipotle all the time and it never made me crap blood.",13,Southpark,93,19,,,,,,,,,
11953,Cartman,8,"Ohh well how nice for you, Stan. It's great you've got a golden rectum of the gods, but the rest of us need Chipotlaway.",13,Southpark,120,24,,,,,,,,,
11955,Stan,8,"Whoa whoa wait, there really are ghosts?",13,Southpark,40,7,,,,,,,,,
11958,Kyle,8,Purgatory? What's that?,13,Southpark,23,3,,,,,,,,,

11965,Cartman,8,"Yes! Yes I am, Billy Mays!",13,Southpark,26,6,,,,,,,,,
11975,Stan,8,Uh oh.,13,Southpark,6,2,,,,,,,,,
11979,Kyle,8,What?,13,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
11981,Kyle,8,"Mister... Jackson, y-you aren't alive. You're in purgatory.",13,Southpark,59,8,,,,,,,,,
11983,Kyle,8,"Mr. Jackson, please, you're causing a lot of problems.",13,Southpark,54,9,,,,,,,,,
11986,Stan,8,"You're dead, Mr. Jackson!",13,Southpark,25,4,,,,,,,,,

11997,Kyle,8,Hey! Heeey!,13,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
11999,Stan,8,"Mr. Jackson, you can't do this! This is not your body!",13,Southpark,54,11,,,,,,,,,
12001,Kyle,8,"Dude, asshole, you're keeping a lot of other celebrities in purgatory!",13,Southpark,70,11,,,,,,,,,
12002,Cartman,8,Including the late and very talented Billy Mays!,13,Southpark,48,8,,,,,,,,,
12004,Kyle,8,What the hell are we going to do??,13,Southpark,34,8,,,,,,,,,
12015,Stan,8,"Alright, let's see: demonic ghosts, animal ghosts...  ...setting traps for ghosts, no...",13,Southpark,88,12,,,,,,,,,
12016,Kyle,8,"Okay, here's the one part that really makes no sense to me:  the first time you saw blood stains on your underwear, were you alarmed?",13,Southpark,133,25,,,,,,,,,
12017,Cartman,8,Was I alarmed?  Yes.  I believe I was.,13,Southpark,38,8,,,,,,,,,
12018,Kyle,8,So then why do you just ignore it using something as stupid as Chipotaway?,13,Southpark,74,14,,,,,,,,,
12019,Cartman,8,"Chipotlaway, Kyle. And I'm not the one who uses it, my mom does. She does the laundry. ",13,Southpark,87,17,,,,,,,,,
12020,Kyle,8,Your mom... uses Chipotlaway... to clean blood stains... out of your underwear?,13,Southpark,79,12,,,,,,,,,
12021,Cartman,8,Yes!,13,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
12022,Kyle,8,"And then takes you to Chipotle, and buys you more?",13,Southpark,50,10,,,,,,,,,
12023,Cartman,8,"Yes, Kyle, it's totally normal!  People do this stuff! You know, not everyone can be the boy with the golden butthole! ",13,Southpark,119,21,,,,,,,,,
12024,Stan,8,Here here here it is: possession by a ghost. A ghost that enters and then refuses to leave a living host has done so because it failed in the living world to be what it wanted to be. The ghost must be allowed to transform and be recognized by the living as what it always tried to be.,13,Southpark,284,58,,,,,,,,,
12025,Kyle,8,What has Michael Jackson always tried to be?,13,Southpark,44,8,,,,,,,,,
12026,Cartman,8,A child... and a female. And white.,13,Southpark,35,7,,,,,,,,,
12028,Stan,8,So he wants to finally be accepted by the living as a little white girl.,13,Southpark,72,15,,,,,,,,,
12029,Kyle,8,"Well what the hell are we gonna do? Dress him up in a princess gown and, and parade him around like the parents on those awful child pageants? ",13,Southpark,143,28,,,,,,,,,

12056,Stan,8,"Excuse me, uh, if you could do us a favor and pleeease just vote for little Miss Jackson? It's really important.",13,Southpark,112,21,,,,,,,,,
12061,Stan,8,"Dude, the two male judges love her.",13,Southpark,35,7,,,,,,,,,
12062,Kenny,8, ,13,Southpark,1,0,,,,,,,,,
12064,Kyle,8,Aww crap!,13,Southpark,9,2,,,,,,,,,

12067,Kyle,8,We're totally screwed!  They took the two best judges away!,13,Southpark,59,10,,,,,,,,,
12068,Stan,8,"Yeah, there's no way that lady judge is voting for us. She was glaring the entire time.",13,Southpark,87,17,,,,,,,,,
12070,Kyle,8,"Aw dide, this is hopeless!",13,Southpark,26,5,,,,,,,,,
12071,Kenny,8,,13,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
12072,Cartman,8,"Wait wait! Wait, look at the lady judge.  She's eating Chipotle.",13,Southpark,64,11,,,,,,,,,
12073,Kyle,8,So what?!,13,Southpark,9,2,,,,,,,,,
12074,Cartman,8,"So maybe she doesn't know.  Maybe she doesn't know, Kyle! Excuse me, Ma'am, I see you're eating Chipotle.",13,Southpark,105,18,,,,,,,,,
12076,Cartman,8,Except! You can't afford buying all the new underwear?,13,Southpark,54,9,,,,,,,,,
12078,Cartman,8,What if you didn't have to give it up?,13,Southpark,38,9,,,,,,,,,
12080,Cartman,8,I think... you and I might be able to help each other here today.,13,Southpark,65,14,,,,,,,,,
12082,Kyle,8,Yeah!,13,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
12083,Cartman,8,Yeah!,13,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
12084,Stan,8,Woohoo!,13,Southpark,7,1,,,,,,,,,
12085,Cartman,8,Good job Ike! ,13,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,
12088,Kyle,8,"Ike!  Ike, you're back!",13,Southpark,23,4,,,,,,,,,
12090,Kyle,8,"It's okay, Ike, you're going to be... okay.",13,Southpark,43,8,,,,,,,,,
12091,Cartman,8,"Yes. Thanks to us and Chipotlaway, the spirits of the celebrities can now rest.",13,Southpark,79,14,,,,,,,,,
12101,Cartman,9,"Alright cool, guys, gather all around. Everyone should be a witness to this.  Alright, you ready? Now say ""I'm a dork, and I deserve what's coming to me."" Come on, dude, ""I'm a dork, and I deserve what's coming to me."" ",13,Southpark,219,41,,,,,,,,,
12102,Butters,9,"I'm a dork, and I deserve what's coming to me.  Ow.",13,Southpark,51,11,,,,,,,,,
12103,Cartman,9,"Alright, your turn Craig.",13,Southpark,25,4,,,,,,,,,
12104,Butters,9,"Fellas, my underwear is so far up my buttcrack my legs are numb! ",13,Southpark,65,13,,,,,,,,,
12105,Cartman,9,Well that's what you get for being a douchebag again Butters! You gotta take your medicine.,13,Southpark,91,16,,,,,,,,,
12106,Butters,9,"Uyeah, I guess I deserve it.",13,Southpark,28,6,,,,,,,,,
12107,Stan,9,"Hey heeey, what the hell are you guys picking on Butters for this time?!",13,Southpark,72,14,,,,,,,,,
12108,Cartman,9,"Aw dude, you guys are not gonna believe this. You know what we just found out? Well it turns out that Butters, our Butters, has never kissed a girl ",13,Southpark,148,29,,,,,,,,,
12109,Butters,9,Uugh!,13,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
12110,Kyle,9,So what?,13,Southpark,8,2,,,,,,,,,
12111,Butters,9,So what?!  So I'm almost nine years old and anyone who hasn't kissed a girl by fourth grade is a dork!,13,Southpark,102,21,,,,,,,,,
12114,Butters,9,Sellin' kisses?,13,Southpark,15,2,,,,,,,,,
12116,Butters,9,You mean I'm... gonna kiss a girl... today?,13,Southpark,43,8,,,,,,,,,
12118,Butters,9,"Oh boy, I sure am nervous.",13,Southpark,26,6,,,,,,,,,
12119,Cartman,9,"Nothin' to be nervous about, Butters. You're finally going to become a man today.",13,Southpark,81,14,,,,,,,,,
12120,Kyle,9,"Butters, I think you should reconsider this.",13,Southpark,44,7,,,,,,,,,
12121,Butters,9,"Uh, how come?",13,Southpark,13,3,,,,,,,,,
12122,Kyle,9,"Dude, you don't want your first kiss to be something you paid for. It's supposed to be special.",13,Southpark,95,18,,,,,,,,,
12123,Cartman,9,"Oh God, why don't you sit under a rainbow and write a poem, Kyle?",13,Southpark,65,14,,,,,,,,,
12124,Butters,9,I gotta do this! I gotta know what it feels like!,13,Southpark,49,11,,,,,,,,,
12125,Butters,9,"Oh boy... Oh jeez, oh, stay calm Butters... Eh, how was it?",13,Southpark,59,12,,,,,,,,,
12128,Butters,9,"I'm going!  Ohh...  Oh, hi.",13,Southpark,27,5,,,,,,,,,
12130,Butters,9,"So ummm yeah, ah, I was hopin' maybe I could get a kiss.",13,Southpark,56,13,,,,,,,,,
12132,Butters,9,"Yeah, cool, uhhhm... umuh... okay. ",13,Southpark,35,5,,,,,,,,,
12134,Butters,9,"Oh, money... Rrright.  There you go. A five dollar bill, all for you. ",13,Southpark,70,13,,,,,,,,,
12136,Butters,9,Thank you! ,13,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
12137,Cartman,9,Atta boy Butters!,13,Southpark,17,3,,,,,,,,,
12141,Butters,9,"Boy oh boy. I finally did it. I'm a man now.  Jeez, I'm gonna start havin' lots of responsibilities soon. I gotta start thinkin' about a career. There's gonna be family and bills to start worrying about. M-no more play time for you, Butters! You gotta buckle down and find, and find yourself a way to make money.  Hey, I know.",13,Southpark,326,61,,,,,,,,,
12142,Butters,9,"Hey fellers! Fellers, do you like gettin' kisses? 'Cause I know a girl that'll give you a great kiss for just five dollars!",13,Southpark,123,23,,,,,,,,,
12144,Butters,9,"Sure, Scott! Even if you got diabetes!",13,Southpark,38,7,,,,,,,,,
12147,Butters,9,"Boy oh boy, this sure is great! I've been thinkin', Sally: I could probably drum up some third grade customers if you could do kisses before school too. We could make double the money.",13,Southpark,184,34,,,,,,,,,
12149,Butters,9,"Aww nuts!  Well, I did have another idea. What if we got another girl to fill in for you sometimes?",13,Southpark,99,20,,,,,,,,,
12151,Butters,9,"Well, you know, we bring someone on, show her what to do, and then share all our money together.",13,Southpark,96,19,,,,,,,,,
12153,Butters,9,We could have our very own...  kissin' company.,13,Southpark,47,8,,,,,,,,,
12154,Butters,9,"The next key to a successful business is ""innovation."" I think maybe we need to understand that some boys simply can't afford the five dollars for a kiss, so what if we start also charging just two dollars for a hug?",13,Southpark,216,41,,,,,,,,,
12156,Butters,9,"Why thanks. Sally, I think your position behind the temp building at recess is perfect. Megan, I'm thinkin' about moving you to the baseball field after school during little league practice.",13,Southpark,190,31,,,,,,,,,
12158,Butters,9,"I got a kissing booth set up at the kids' fair on Saturday so Kayla and Ashley, you take turns there. Any girl that sells more than twenty kisses gets  a little sunshine, but if you don't show up for work at all, I'm afraid you get a stormy cloud.",13,Southpark,247,50,,,,,,,,,
12177,Kyle,9,Did you guys hear what's going on? There's like four girls at the school now offering to kiss boys for money.,13,Southpark,109,21,,,,,,,,,
12178,Stan,9,"Yeah, I heard that now even Stacey Anderson is selling kisses.",13,Southpark,62,11,,,,,,,,,
12179,Kenny,9, ,13,Southpark,1,0,,,,,,,,,
12180,Butters,9,Hey fellas. Would anyone like a coupon. We're offerin' two for one kisses today through Thursday.,13,Southpark,97,16,,,,,,,,,
12181,Stan,9,"Butters, you're the one doing all this?",13,Southpark,39,7,,,,,,,,,
12182,Butters,9,Yep! I am founder and head CEO of the Butters Kissing Company. Just look at this. ,13,Southpark,82,16,,,,,,,,,
12183,Cartman,9,"Damn dude, you made all that money offa chicks?",13,Southpark,47,9,,,,,,,,,
12184,Butters,9,"I'm tellin' ya guys, this is the most genius idea I've ever come up with. A lot of boys would pay to kiss my employees.",13,Southpark,119,25,,,,,,,,,
12185,Kyle,9,"You didn't think of anything, Butters! Guys have been doing what you're doing for years! You're nothin' but a common pimp! ",13,Southpark,123,21,,,,,,,,,
12186,Butters,9,...A pimp. Huh...,13,Southpark,17,3,,,,,,,,,
12187,Butters,9,"Bohy, Kyle was right, Sally. There's guys with kissing companies all over the country. ""The person managing all the women is known as the 'pimp,' while the working women are referred to as 'ho' or 'bitch.'"" Oh, you're a bitch, Sally. ",13,Southpark,234,41,,,,,,,,,
12189,Butters,9,"Hey, look at this! There's about to be a big pimp convention, it looks like. I gotta get to that convention, Sally. I could learn all kinds of stuff for our company.",13,Southpark,165,32,,,,,,,,,
12190,Butters,9,"Hi there. My name is Butters. This sure is a nice convention, huh? Yeah, I'm just starting out. I really came last minute 'cause I was hoping to learn more about being a successful pimp.",13,Southpark,186,35,,,,,,,,,
12192,Butters,9,"Yeah, just about a week now. I have four girls at the moment, but I feel like I could be doing a better job.",13,Southpark,108,24,,,,,,,,,
12194,Butters,9,What's the game?,13,Southpark,16,3,,,,,,,,,
12196,Butters,9,Yes I- I know what you are saying. You don't have to keep asking.,13,Southpark,65,14,,,,,,,,,
12198,Butters,9,I know what you're saying.,13,Southpark,26,5,,,,,,,,,
12200,Butters,9,Yeah! I believe I know what you are saying!,13,Southpark,43,9,,,,,,,,,
12202,Butters,9,Hey Dad!,13,Southpark,8,2,,,,,,,,,
12204,Butters,9,"Aw hell Dad, I got lots of girlfriends. Sally's just my bottom bitch.  Do you know what I am saying? ",13,Southpark,101,20,,,,,,,,,
12234,Butters,9,"Boy oh boy, really great work, bitches. You all sold lots of kisses today. Except for you, Megan, I'm afraid you get a stormy cloud sticker today.",13,Southpark,146,27,,,,,,,,,
12236,Butters,9,"I just hold on to all the money, 'cause bitches can't be trusted with it. We pool all the kissing money together, see? But if you wanna buy anything, you just talk to the bottom bitch , and then the bottom bitch talks to me. Alright, see you after school!  Do you know what I am saying?",13,Southpark,286,57,,,,,,,,,
12237,Mr. Garrison,9,"Alright children, I want you to copy down these math problems and solve them before recess.",13,Southpark,91,16,,,,,,,,,
12238,Butters,9,"Yo, Bebe. Bebe yo.",13,Southpark,18,4,,,,,,,,,
12240,Butters,9,Bitch you wanna make some motherfuckin' money?,13,Southpark,46,7,,,,,,,,,
12242,Butters,9,"Bitch you should be doin' kisses on the playground. You can make fifty bucks a day! Buy all the purses and shoes that you've ever wanted. I'll treat you right, bitch.",13,Southpark,166,31,,,,,,,,,
12244,Butters,9,"Oh, alright then.  Hey Wendy. Wendy!  Bitch, don't you wanna start makin' some real fuckin' money?",13,Southpark,98,16,,,,,,,,,
12246,Butters,9,"Why you were made for the playground, bitch. You should be out there workin'. Don't you want a new lunch box? Nice new coat? I can get all that for you, bitch.",13,Southpark,159,32,,,,,,,,,
12247,Stan,9,Butters. Dude!,13,Southpark,14,2,,,,,,,,,
12248,Butters,9,What?,13,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
12249,Stan,9,You can't call my girlfriend a bitch!,13,Southpark,37,7,,,,,,,,,
12250,Butters,9,Oh. Well all I'm sayin' the bitch should be out there workin' is all.  Whatcha doin' bitch? Just givin' kisses to Stan for free? Why you should be makin' some motherfuckin' money!,13,Southpark,179,32,,,,,,,,,
12252,Stan,9,"Butters, seriously, if you don't stop this I'll kick your ass!",13,Southpark,62,11,,,,,,,,,
12253,Butters,9,"Clyde, here's a hundred bucks. If Stan comes near me, punch him.",13,Southpark,64,12,,,,,,,,,
12255,Cartman,9,"Dude, we've created a monster.",13,Southpark,30,5,,,,,,,,,
12256,Butters,9,"Come on Wendy, you should be puttin' that mouth to work.",13,Southpark,56,11,,,,,,,,,
12257,Mr. Garrison,9,"Butters! Butters, do you have a problem?!",13,Southpark,41,7,,,,,,,,,
12258,Butters,9,"All these bitches are kissin' fellers, and they haven't figured out that they can be making some serious fuckin' money!",13,Southpark,119,20,,,,,,,,,
12259,Butters,9,"Really glad you joined the company, Annie! Now remember: you're chargin' five dollars for a kiss, two for a hug, and six for half and half. Alright bitch? Alright, how about a freebie?  Ohwoah,  whoopie! ",13,Southpark,204,35,,,,,,,,,
12260,Kyle,9,"Butters, I really think we should talk.",13,Southpark,39,7,,,,,,,,,
12261,Butters,9,"Sure, Kyle.",13,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
12262,Kyle,9,"Butters, can't you see this is wrong? You've got little boys all over school spending all their lunch money on kisses. Boys shouldn't be paying for kisses. It's wrong.",13,Southpark,167,29,,,,,,,,,
12263,Butters,9,"Kyle, every boy pays for kisses. Do you know what I am saying? If you've got a girl, and she kisses you, sooner or later you're paying for it. You've gotta take her out to lunch, take her to a movie, and then spend time listenin' to all her stupid problems. Look, look at Stan right there.  He's gotta sit there and listen to her stupid motherfuckin' problems 'cause she kisses him. If you ask me, that's a lot more than the five dollars my company charges.",13,Southpark,457,87,,,,,,,,,
12264,Kyle,9,"Butters, what's happened to you?",13,Southpark,32,5,,,,,,,,,
12265,Butters,9,"What happened is that I became a man! I'm sorry I'm not your little buddy anymore, but there's a time people have to grow up!  Do you know what I am saying?! ",13,Southpark,158,32,,,,,,,,,
12282,Butters,9,And that's... three thousand dollars today for Charise. ,13,Southpark,56,8,,,,,,,,,
12284,Butters,9,"REALLY great work, bitch! That is another...  sunshine sticker for you.",13,Southpark,71,11,,,,,,,,,
12286,Butters,9,Mmmwhoa boy!,13,Southpark,12,2,,,,,,,,,
12287,Butters,9,"And so, I would like to see if there are any housing loan opportunities for some of my employees, and also what kind of corporate tax I should be filing under.",13,Southpark,159,31,,,,,,,,,
12289,Butters,9,It's a kissing company.,13,Southpark,23,4,,,,,,,,,
12291,Butters,9,"Oh sure! My black employee Charise over there, one time she made two thousand dollars, on one customer! Can you believe it? Two thousand dollars just to kiss a feller. She currently stays in a motel room, 'cause a lot of her customers see her late.  You wouldn't believe the time of night some fellers wanna kiss.",13,Southpark,313,57,,,,,,,,,
12293,Butters,9,"'Course. My bottom bitch keeps a database of all our customers, specially the VIPs, like Senator Morris.",13,Southpark,104,17,,,,,,,,,
12295,Butters,9,Sure! Senator Morris gets kisses every day at lunchtime. You know where he likes to get kissed?,13,Southpark,95,17,,,,,,,,,
12297,Butters,9,In a motel room. Darnedest thing. He must get sleepy.,13,Southpark,53,10,,,,,,,,,
12299,Butters,9,Huh? Why?,13,Southpark,9,2,,,,,,,,,
12301,Butters,9,But I heard ACORN helps pimps and their bitches!,13,Southpark,48,9,,,,,,,,,
12305,Butters,9,Heey! Mr. Daniels! You get kisses from my bitch Roxy in the alley behind Sizzler. ,13,Southpark,82,15,,,,,,,,,
12306,Butters,9,"Boy, how do you like that, bitches? Approval for two housing loans and tax-exempt status. File these away, Sally.",13,Southpark,113,19,,,,,,,,,
12313,Butters,9,"Whoa whoa, bitches, bitches!",13,Southpark,28,4,,,,,,,,,
12315,Butters,9,"Oh. Well we operate on a sixty-forty split here. Bitches have access to Medicare and now, low-income housing loans.",13,Southpark,115,19,,,,,,,,,
12318,Butters,9,What's that?,13,Southpark,12,2,,,,,,,,,
12323,Butters,9,"Well wait, hold on now. Why I'd never get in the way of somebody being happy. Well us pimps gotta be good. Even to each other.",13,Southpark,126,26,,,,,,,,,
12326,Butters,9,Wha? Awww.,13,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,
12332,Butters,9,"Oh, oh.  Oh jeez. ",13,Southpark,18,4,,,,,,,,,
12333,Butters,9,"Gals. Gals, could you all come gather round? Gather round, gals; take a knee.  Gals, I... well I'm afraid I can't do this anymore. I'm gonna be leavin' the company. Well I enjoyed being your pimp and all, it's just that... when I see real love, like what those two people have, well, well it just makes me feel like a... well, like a dick. Well I may be a man now, but it doesn't mean I have the right to be earnin' money for what girls do, whether you're chargin' fellers for kisses by cash or by makin' them listen to your stupid motherfuckin' problems. Well that's your hard work. Bitches, this is your company now, so get out there, and make yourselves some motherfuckin' money!",13,Southpark,682,127,,,,,,,,,
12345,Cartman,10,"Oh my God, this is just sooo awesome!",13,Southpark,37,8,,,,,,,,,
12346,Stan,10,I'm having the best time!,13,Southpark,25,5,,,,,,,,,
12351,Cartman,10,"Oh, sweet! ",13,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
12353,Butters,10,Yes! Yehhehehes!,13,Southpark,16,2,,,,,,,,,
12354,Cartman,10,This is awesome!,13,Southpark,16,3,,,,,,,,,
12355,Cartman,10,Dude! That was so badass!,13,Southpark,25,5,,,,,,,,,
12356,Kyle,10,Wrestling is awesome!,13,Southpark,21,3,,,,,,,,,
12357,Stan,10,This is it you guys! We know what our calling in life is now. Tomorrow we are signing up for wrestling class! ,13,Southpark,110,22,,,,,,,,,
12358,Cartman,10,The fuck is this?!,13,Southpark,18,4,,,,,,,,,
12359,Stan,10,Why did they have us put on long underwear.,13,Southpark,43,9,,,,,,,,,
12360,Kyle,10,"Well ah I guess in wrestling we're supposed to make our own outfit, and then wear it over this.",13,Southpark,95,19,,,,,,,,,
12361,Butters,10,"Ohhh. Yeah, that makes sense.",13,Southpark,29,5,,,,,,,,,
12362,Kyle,10,"Alright, so did everyone settle on their wrestling names?",13,Southpark,57,9,,,,,,,,,
12363,Cartman,10,I did. I'm the Rad Russian.  I come from Russian to crush your puny capitalist heads!,13,Southpark,85,16,,,,,,,,,
12365,Kyle,10,Cool!,13,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
12366,Stan,10,Yeah!,13,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
12367,Butters,10,Let's do this!,13,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,
12368,Cartman,10,All right!,13,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,
12370,Cartman,10,The Rad Russian.,13,Southpark,16,3,,,,,,,,,
12372,Cartman,10,"You capitalist swine, I'll crush you!",13,Southpark,37,6,,,,,,,,,
12374,Cartman,10,Huh?,13,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
12376,Cartman,10,Okay...,13,Southpark,7,1,,,,,,,,,
12378,Butters,10,Triceratops!,13,Southpark,12,1,,,,,,,,,
12380,Cartman,10,The fuck is this?!,13,Southpark,18,4,,,,,,,,,
12382,Cartman,10,Dude! Dude! DUDE!  The fuck are you doing?!,13,Southpark,43,8,,,,,,,,,
12384,Cartman,10,"That's not wrestling, dude, that's fucking gay!",13,Southpark,47,7,,,,,,,,,
12385,Stan,10,"Yeah, what are you? A child molester?",13,Southpark,37,7,,,,,,,,,
12386,Kyle,10,Where's all the cool costumes and jumping off ropes and stuff?!,13,Southpark,63,11,,,,,,,,,
12390,Cartman,10,"Well this is fucking lame dude! Let's get the hell out of here, guys. ",13,Southpark,70,14,,,,,,,,,
12391,Stan,10,"Yeah, this guy probably wants to take pictures of us naked.",13,Southpark,59,11,,,,,,,,,
12392,Butters,10,"I got, half a mind to report, r-report you to the police, sir! ",13,Southpark,63,13,,,,,,,,,
12394,Cartman,10,"The Wrestling Takedown Federation has several matches planned today. Alright, sooo, here's how we'll do this, guys. I'll come out to the ring first and then Jimmy, you come in and tell me you're gonna kick my ass. Then I'm gonna say ""You slept with my girlfriend,"" and I'll charge you into a head slap.",13,Southpark,302,55,,,,,,,,,
12396,Cartman,10,"Then Butters, you come in as the ref all like ""No no, the fight hasn't started yet,"" and that's when Jimmy sneaks up from behind and hits me over the head with a foldaway chair.",13,Southpark,177,35,,,,,,,,,
12397,Butters,10,Okey doke.,13,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,
12399,Cartman,10,"Noo, let's save the ""girlfriend is a whore"" line until after Stan headbutts Butters for trying to stop the fight again.",13,Southpark,119,21,,,,,,,,,
12400,Butters,10,"Hmboy, wrestling sure is fun!",13,Southpark,29,5,,,,,,,,,

12417,Kyle,10,"I'll kill you, Triceratops! You made fun of my crippled mother!",13,Southpark,63,11,,,,,,,,,
12418,Butters,10,"That's because your mother betrayed my mothers, Juggernaut!",13,Southpark,59,8,,,,,,,,,
12419,Stan,10,You don't come to this country and make fun of it!,13,Southpark,50,11,,,,,,,,,

12437,Kyle,10,"Your girlfriend doesn't even like you, Stan the Man! She likes me!",13,Southpark,66,12,,,,,,,,,
12438,Stan,10,You have no idea what you're saying Juggernaut! Irene loves me and I'm gonna marry her!,13,Southpark,87,16,,,,,,,,,
12439,Kyle,10,"If she wants to be with you, how about you have her tell all these people here?",13,Southpark,79,17,,,,,,,,,

12442,Stan,10,What?!,13,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
12445,Stan,10,"If you love Juggernaut, Irene, then tell him what you did two years ago! How you killed his child!",13,Southpark,98,19,,,,,,,,,
12446,Cartman,10,It's true. I was pregnant with your child and aborted it. ,13,Southpark,58,11,,,,,,,,,
12447,Kyle,10,"Irene, no! Why?",13,Southpark,15,3,,,,,,,,,
12448,Cartman,10,Do you know what it's like to have an abortion at seven years old? DO YOU? I've had so many abortions. I just... got addicted to them.,13,Southpark,134,27,,,,,,,,,
12451,Stan,10,"Irene, you said you loved me!",13,Southpark,29,6,,,,,,,,,
12452,Cartman,10,"I'm not in love with you, I'm in love with abortions. Don't you undestand?! ",13,Southpark,76,14,,,,,,,,,

12473,Stan,10,"Only a country like yours can breed men of such discontent, Rad Russian. But you don't know what real pain is! PAIN! Like I've known. Abandoned when I was four years old by my parents. Left to die in a cold and dark sewage tunnel!",13,Southpark,230,45,,,,,,,,,
12485,Kyle,10,So I'm thinking we do the part about Jimmy's relationship with his alcoholic father after you smash Butters onto the table.,13,Southpark,123,21,,,,,,,,,
12487,Cartman,10,"You guys! You guys, listen to this! It's amazing!",13,Southpark,49,9,,,,,,,,,

12499,Kyle,10,Omigod! Omigod! Omigod!,13,Southpark,23,3,,,,,,,,,
12500,Cartman,10,"Okay guys! Guys, listen! We seriously have to focus here! We have exactly three days before the scout is here to see us wrestle. We gotta step it up and work it like never before.",13,Southpark,179,35,,,,,,,,,
12501,Stan,10,Alright it's time to start the second act. Let's bring the crowd back in from intermission and then improvise some stuff for Saturday!,13,Southpark,134,23,,,,,,,,,
12505,Kyle,10,"I left my wife today. Walked out of the apartment without saying a word. I ran away from my responsibilities... just like I always do.  And I, again, am alone. ",13,Southpark,160,30,,,,,,,,,
12506,Stan,10,"Here he is, hiding in the forest as I told you. ",13,Southpark,48,11,,,,,,,,,
12507,Butters,10,Juggernaut! There is to be an Ultimate Smackdown this Saturday! Are you going to run from that as well?,13,Southpark,103,19,,,,,,,,,
12508,Kyle,10,"I'll fight anytime, anywhere!",13,Southpark,29,4,,,,,,,,,
12511,Stan,10,What do I do? Juggernaut is my long lost brother.  And yet Congo saved my life in Nam. ,13,Southpark,87,18,,,,,,,,,
12513,Cartman,10,"Thanks for coming, guys. I'm sure you're wondering why I've called you here to Sizzler.",13,Southpark,87,15,,,,,,,,,
12514,Kyle,10,"Yeah, what's this about? We should be writing our monologues for Smackdown.",13,Southpark,75,12,,,,,,,,,
12515,Cartman,10,"Well guys, Kenny and I have been talking.",13,Southpark,41,8,,,,,,,,,
12516,Kenny,10,,13,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
12517,Cartman,10,"And, I mean, Smackdown might be our one shot at making it into the WWE, right? I mean a shot like this might never come again.",13,Southpark,126,26,,,,,,,,,
12518,Stan,10,Yeah?,13,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
12519,Cartman,10,"Well, the way we see it, we have three primary obstacles in making Smackdown a great show: Token, Butters, Jimmy.",13,Southpark,113,20,,,,,,,,,
12520,Kenny,10,,13,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
12521,Kyle,10,What are you talking about?,13,Southpark,27,5,,,,,,,,,
12522,Cartman,10,"Guys, let's face it: they can't wrestle for crap! I mean, every time I wrestle with one of them, they flub a line or blow their monologue. And Token? He has no emotion, no timing, he's the worst wrestler I've ever seen!",13,Southpark,219,42,,,,,,,,,
12523,Stan,10,He's right.,13,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
12524,Kyle,10,What?,13,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
12525,Stan,10,"Dude, it's really hard to do your best wrestling when you're up against Token.",13,Southpark,78,14,,,,,,,,,
12526,Cartman,10,Right?,13,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
12527,Stan,10,"And Butters and Jimmy I mean, they're okay but, they're never gonna make it as professional wrestlers.",13,Southpark,102,17,,,,,,,,,
12528,Kyle,10,"Well, so then WWE will recruit us and not them.",13,Southpark,47,10,,,,,,,,,
12529,Cartman,10,"No dude, they're gonna hurt our chances.",13,Southpark,40,7,,,,,,,,,
12530,Kenny,10,,13,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
12531,Cartman,10,"Because we all know that the new material I've written is stuff those guys can't handle, and we'll suffer from it!",13,Southpark,114,21,,,,,,,,,
12532,Kyle,10,So what do we do?,13,Southpark,17,5,,,,,,,,,
12533,Kenny,10,,13,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
12534,Cartman,10,Yep. We've gotta bring somebody else on who can handle the more difficult roles that we can wrestle against instead of those guys.,13,Southpark,130,23,,,,,,,,,
12535,Stan,10,"Somebody who can do the harder stuff we've written so that Token, Butters, and Jimmy can have smaller parts.",13,Southpark,108,19,,,,,,,,,
12536,Kyle,10,How do we find somebody who can wrestle that well?,13,Southpark,50,10,,,,,,,,,
12537,Cartman,10,It's simple. We just gotta hold tryouts.,13,Southpark,40,7,,,,,,,,,
12538,Cartman,10,"Number seventeen step forward, please?  You're wrestling a Muslim immigrant. You suspect he could be a terrorist and your parrents died in the 9/11 attacks. Go!",13,Southpark,160,26,,,,,,,,,
12540,Cartman,10,"Thank you! Number twenty-four?  You're wrestling for the right to marry Mackenzie Phillips, but just learned that she had sex with her father uh, go!",13,Southpark,149,25,,,,,,,,,
12542,Cartman,10,Thank you. ,13,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
12543,Kyle,10,That guy's a pretty good wrestler.,13,Southpark,34,6,,,,,,,,,
12544,Kenny,10,,13,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
12545,Stan,10,"Yeah yeah, not bad.",13,Southpark,19,4,,,,,,,,,
12546,Cartman,10,"Let's see uh, can we get number thirty seven to step forward again.  We just wanna get to know you all a little better. What can you tell us about yourself?",13,Southpark,156,31,,,,,,,,,

12558,Stan,10,"Heyhey whoa, you shouldn't be fighting anybody. What about your cancer?",13,Southpark,71,11,,,,,,,,,
12559,Kyle,10,Wait a minute. Who is that?,13,Southpark,27,6,,,,,,,,,
12560,Stan,10,"It's Triceratops, and he's with Irene. ",13,Southpark,39,6,,,,,,,,,
12561,Kyle,10,"You aren't welcome here, Triceratops!",13,Southpark,37,5,,,,,,,,,
12562,Cartman,10,My man can do whatever he wants.,13,Southpark,32,7,,,,,,,,,
12564,Cartman,10,You're just gonna have to deal with that.,13,Southpark,41,8,,,,,,,,,
12566,Butters,10,"No Irene, please! Just this once, do not abort this baby!",13,Southpark,57,11,,,,,,,,,
12567,Cartman,10,"My body, my rights! In fact, I'm jonesing for the rush so badly, I don't think I'll make it to the clinic.",13,Southpark,106,22,,,,,,,,,
12568,Stan,10,"No, you can't possibly mean that-!",13,Southpark,34,6,,,,,,,,,
12569,Cartman,10,"Yes! I think maybe I'll have another abortion! Right here, right now!",13,Southpark,69,12,,,,,,,,,

12574,Cartman,10,You! Get back in the trashcan where you belong!,13,Southpark,47,9,,,,,,,,,
12576,Stan,10,"Irene, there's no way we could let you here, and I'd let you something informal like that.",13,Southpark,90,17,,,,,,,,,
12579,Butters,10,Stay out of my business Sergeant Hammerclaw! You just stay out of my way!,13,Southpark,73,14,,,,,,,,,
12581,Butters,10,Are you sure?,13,Southpark,13,3,,,,,,,,,
12584,Cartman,10,"O, how I long for the spring meadows of Russia! The soft Russian sky!",13,Southpark,69,14,,,,,,,,,
12585,Stan,10,"When are you going to face reality, Congo? Just because you were raised by panthers doesn't mean you are one!",13,Southpark,109,20,,,,,,,,,

12667,Stan,11,"It seems like everyone has an attitude of ""that's just the way they are"" or ""that's just the way it is""! Nobody likes it, but everybody's too busy to do anything about it!",13,Southpark,171,33,,,,,,,,,
12668,Cartman,11,"I'm not too busy, Stan.",13,Southpark,23,5,,,,,,,,,

The light turns yellow, should be your turn to go, but the traffic coming at you just keeps coming.

13096,Cartman,13,"Good morning South Park Elementary. These are the morning announcements. And I, am Eric Cartman. All forms for the school book drive must be handed it to Mr. Davis in the library by the end of the school day today. Hm, doesn't seem like they gave us a lot of notice on that, uh, 'kay. Oh well.  For lunch today, the cafeteria will be serving a selection of cold sandwiches. Cold sandwiches. Oh well, thank you so much! Remember when we used to be served hot food? I mean, what has happened to our school? This school is transforming into something very bad, and why? Because we have leadership that doesn't care! I'm talking of course about our student body president, Wendy Testaburger!  Ever since Wendy was elected student body president, this school has started a rapid decline towards some socialist regime where students no longer have a voice! The music room will be closed off today due to painting. All students in band and choir will meet in the gymnasium instead. Oh oh, so now, so now the school is using money to paint the music room. How old and outdated is our playground equipment? What other school has a fifteen-year-old merry-go-round on it? Our school president is turning this whole place into Communist Russia!  It's not a coincidence that once Wendy took office this school started coming apart at the seams! Your teachers don't wanna tell you, but they are scared, and they should be, because the very fabric of this elementary school is tearing from all corners.",13,Southpark,1487,260,,,,,,,,,

13098,Cartman,13,"But hey, I'm just a normal kid, like you, except that I ask questions. And because I'm brave enough to ask questions, I come under scrutinies. Is Wendy using your lunch money to buy heroin? Probably not, but how can we know? I don't want my lunch money going to drugs! Who's taking these drugs? What would be the point? I'm asking questions!",13,Southpark,341,63,,,,,,,,,

13108,Cartman,13,"Oh I will! And maybe I'll also have a word with the ACLU, tell them that a student is being told not to speak out against his school! I'm sure they'll find that very interesting!",13,Southpark,178,35,,,,,,,,,
13109,Cartman,13,"Well. Goood morning South Park Elementary. These are the morning announcements. Tryouts for the soccer team are on Friday afternoon. That is of course if our student body president does something about our abysmal soccer field.  I have a question. What does Wendy Testaburger actually do? She is supposed to be the president, right? What is her agenda? She's lying to everyone? Or is she? Let's ask these questions.  Today I wanna talk briefly about the state of our school's economy. The bake sale last week was a complete failure. And in the school-  And besides that, who actually voted for Wendy Testaburger? I know I didn't. And everyone who did is now scratching their heads and goin' ""Whoops. Guess I shouldn't have done that.""  I'm not in the student council, I'm just a normal kid like all of you. And like all of you, I want to know what has happened... to my school.",13,Southpark,877,155,,,,,,,,,

But ohhh no, Wendy Testaburger's not gonna let that happen! This is not the school we grew up in, and ...and I don't know if we can get it back.  So let's take a look at exactly what our school president wants. You know, what is she trying to achieve? Let's just take a look at these Keywords here: Wendy's made it clear she wants our school to be a more Integrated Leftist and Liberal place! But you see what then happens, what we get is a Socialist, Modern, Utopian, Reformed, Farce of a School. So when you look closely it becomes very obvious what Wendy wants. K I L L S M U R F S.

13142,Cartman,13,"Yes, well now you can read about all those things I've said, Butters. Take this copy of my book.",13,Southpark,96,19,,,,,,,,,
13143,Butters,13,"Cool, thanks.",13,Southpark,13,2,,,,,,,,,
13144,Cartman,13,That'll be five dollars.,13,Southpark,24,4,,,,,,,,,
13145,Butters,13,"Oh, okay. ",13,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,
13146,Stan,13,What the hell do you think you're doing?!,13,Southpark,41,8,,,,,,,,,
13147,Cartman,13,A book signing.,13,Southpark,15,3,,,,,,,,,
13148,Stan,13,I looked through your stupid book! It's five hundred and forty pages of ripping on Wendy and calling her a slut!,13,Southpark,112,21,,,,,,,,,
13149,Cartman,13,I do not directly say she's a slut!,13,Southpark,35,8,,,,,,,,,
13150,Stan,13,"""Wendy Testaburger has proven time and time again that she will do anything to pleasure her vagina. Whether it is the school football team or the janitors on their break, Wendy spends her time as president on her knees or on her back taking the old in-out for hours on end""!",13,Southpark,274,51,,,,,,,,,
13151,Cartman,13,"You didn't read the rest, dude.",13,Southpark,31,6,,,,,,,,,
13152,Stan,13,"""Or does she?""",13,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,
13153,Cartman,13,"""Or does she?"" See, that's a question. I'm asking questions, Stan! I've called for Wendy to come on my show and defend herself, but she won't do it!",13,Southpark,148,28,,,,,,,,,
13154,Butters,13,"Yeah, and she hates Smurfs!",13,Southpark,27,5,,,,,,,,,
13156,Stan,13,"Hey hey, stop reading that!",13,Southpark,27,5,,,,,,,,,
13158,Stan,13,"Listen, just because a guy's voice is on the intercom and his words are in a book, doesn't mean he has any idea what he's talking about!",13,Southpark,136,27,,,,,,,,,
13161,Stan,13,"Wendy, did you see the stuff Cartman is saying about you now?",13,Southpark,61,12,,,,,,,,,
13163,Stan,13,Well don't you think you should go on his show and defend yourself?! Everyone is starting to think you're a crappy president.,13,Southpark,125,22,,,,,,,,,
13165,Cartman,13,"You wanted to see me again, Principal Victoria?",13,Southpark,47,8,,,,,,,,,
13167,Cartman,13,"Oh, Wendy came and told on me?! So what? Because she's president she can't be written about?",13,Southpark,92,17,,,,,,,,,
13169,Cartman,13,And what if they are?! You'll stop me from asking just because Wendy forces you to?!,13,Southpark,84,16,,,,,,,,,
13171,Cartman,13,"Just enough power to force you to stop me from selling my book! Face it, you're a lackey, Mackey!",13,Southpark,97,19,,,,,,,,,
13173,Cartman,13,"Clear as summer rain! Clear as a flavorless bottle of vitamin water! This school has finally transformed to the socialist whoreland where a student isn't free! Well I'm not gonna be a part of it, do you understand?! I'm leaving this... hypocritical Communist school! i'm walking out and I'm never coming back! ",13,Southpark,310,52,,,,,,,,,
13175,Cartman,13,"Yesterday, as most of you know, I walked out on this program, and on our school. I was so... fed up with our president's hypocrisies, me not being able to sell my book. I wanted to live in a place where my values were still upheld. And so I decided to leave it all behind and instead just go and live with the Smurfs.  I simply observed the gentle Smurfs at first. I wanted to understand how they could live such simple and decent lives. They were wary of me in the beginning, but slowly I began to earn their trust.  It wasn't long before the gentle Smurfs accepted me as one of their own. ",13,Southpark,591,115,,,,,,,,,
13176,Butters,13,Whoa... ,13,Southpark,8,1,,,,,,,,,
13177,Cartman,13,"The smurfs and I grew to understand each other.  They shared with me their art of picking Smurfberries, and I shared with them stories of my country's forefathers. Of course, it wasn't long before ...I fell in love with Smurfette.  We're from two different worlds and yet we spoke the common language of passion.",13,Southpark,312,54,,,,,,,,,
13178,Kyle,13,"""These, are the morning announcements."" ",13,Southpark,40,5,,,,,,,,,
13179,Cartman,13,"Papa Smurf was displeased at first,  He told Smurfette I wasn't a real Smurf and we could never be happy. But I eventually proved myself to Papa Smurf by picking more Smurfberries than any Smurf had ever Smurfed before. Finally, all was right with the world. But then, a crisis. Clumsy Smurf burst into the Smurf ceremony to say that humans had come to destroy all of Smurfland.",13,Southpark,378,68,,,,,,,,,
13190,Cartman,13,"And so now our school has plenty of precious unattainable Smurfberries. Yeah well big deal. At what cost did our school president get it? Every Smurf is dead. Wiped out and we will never see them again! Go on, look outside! You won't see any Smurfs!  Of course, since I'm being silenced, I'm not allowed time to show you the entire movie. And so please buy Dances with Smurfs available now on DVD.  The question now is, What happened to morals? What happened to dignity? What happened to my schooool?",13,Southpark,500,90,,,,,,,,,
13191,Butters,13,That does it! Our student council is corrupt and has to be dealt with!,13,Southpark,70,14,,,,,,,,,
13193,Butters,13,"We need to get all the kids together who wanna fight back and tell them to meet after school! We will forever remember this day, the day we finally stood up to Wendy Testaburger!",13,Southpark,178,34,,,,,,,,,
13196,Butters,13,"I don't know about all of you, but I have had enough! We've been sitting back and watching as our school slowly goes into the toilet! But today, we do something about it!  So let's march right over there to Wendy's house and do what we know needs to be done! ",13,Southpark,259,51,,,,,,,,,
13197,Butters,13,Let us not forget what happens this day!,13,Southpark,40,8,,,,,,,,,
13199,Butters,13,"We are here, Wendy Testaburger! ",13,Southpark,32,5,,,,,,,,,
13202,Butters,13,I am.,13,Southpark,5,2,,,,,,,,,
13204,Butters,13,The students want answerrrrs! Go on the Morning Announcements if you've got nothing to hide!,13,Southpark,92,15,,,,,,,,,
13206,Butters,13,Wah!  Smurfkiller!  Answer for your crimes on the Morning Announcements!,13,Southpark,72,10,,,,,,,,,
13209,Cartman,13,"Thank you so much for finally coming on my show, Wendy.",13,Southpark,55,11,,,,,,,,,
13211,Cartman,13,People are riled up. Hopefully we can clear the air here this morning.,13,Southpark,70,13,,,,,,,,,
13213,Cartman,13,Of course. That's why we're here.,13,Southpark,33,6,,,,,,,,,
13215,Cartman,13,"Don't worry, I won't go too hard on you.  Good morning South Park Elementary, these are the morning announcements. Rehearsals for the school play are cancelled this afternoon. For lunch the cafeteria will be serving meat loaf or veggie pasta. My guest today is the student body president of South Park Elementary, Wendy Testaburger. Wendy, thank you for coming on the show.",13,Southpark,373,62,,,,,,,,,
13217,Cartman,13,"Wendy, I wanna start by asking a pretty straightforward question, and I hope you don't take offense to it.",13,Southpark,106,19,,,,,,,,,
13219,Cartman,13,How many Smurfberries is the life of each Smurf worth? ,13,Southpark,55,10,,,,,,,,,
13221,Cartman,13,You don't know how many Smurfberries the life of each Smurf is worth.,13,Southpark,69,13,,,,,,,,,
13222,Butters,13,"Ohhh, he's got her now!",13,Southpark,23,5,,,,,,,,,
13223,Cartman,13,Would you agree that the school is in a crisis right now?,13,Southpark,57,12,,,,,,,,,
13225,Cartman,13,"If a Smurf dies and no one is around to hear it, does it still scream? ",13,Southpark,71,16,,,,,,,,,
13226,Butters,13,She's speechless!,13,Southpark,17,2,,,,,,,,,
13227,Cartman,13,You are the president of the school. Can you see why many students think you're an ineffective slut? Are you denying that the Smurf holocaust ever happened? Is that what you're suggesting?,13,Southpark,188,32,,,,,,,,,
13229,Cartman,13,"Yes, and that makes- whoa whoa what?",13,Southpark,36,7,,,,,,,,,
13231,Cartman,13,What? What do you mean I know that?,13,Southpark,35,8,,,,,,,,,
13233,Cartman,13,No! You wiped them all out!,13,Southpark,27,6,,,,,,,,,
13235,Cartman,13,"Wait, hold on, can we take a break?",13,Southpark,35,8,,,,,,,,,
13237,Stan,13,What?!,13,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
13239,Butters,13,All right! Cartman's president. We did it.,13,Southpark,42,7,,,,,,,,,
13241,Cartman,13,"Dude, you can't take my Dances with Smurfs idea and turn it into your own thing-",13,Southpark,80,16,,,,,,,,,
13243,Cartman,13,"No! No, dude! You don't just take one person's story and then add a couple of things and call it yours!",13,Southpark,103,21,,,,,,,,,
13245,Cartman,13,You sold the movie rights to who?!,13,Southpark,34,7,,,,,,,,,
13247,Cartman,13,Theh- They can't do that! I'm student body president!,13,Southpark,53,9,,,,,,,,,
13248,Cartman,13,Oh God damn it! Son of a bitch idea-stealing assholes!  You sons of bitches! Dances with Smurfs was MY idea! MY IDEA!  You can't just take Dances with Smurfs and call it something else! ,13,Southpark,186,34,,,,,,,,,
13249,Cartman,13,Huh!,13,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
13250,Stan,13,"Dude, what happened? You're not doing the morning announcements anymore?",13,Southpark,72,10,,,,,,,,,
13251,Cartman,13,"No, because it turns out that by rule, the student body president can't also be the morning announcement reader!",13,Southpark,112,19,,,,,,,,,
13252,Kyle,13,"Oh well, at least as president you can run the school the way you want.",13,Southpark,71,15,,,,,,,,,
13253,Cartman,13,I can't do jack! I went to my first student council meeting; all we did was talk about what colors to make the stupid Sadie Hawkins dance! Student council's retarded! ,13,Southpark,167,30,,,,,,,,,
13255,Cartman,13,I'm doin' the best I can! ,13,Southpark,26,6,,,,,,,,,
13256,Cartman,14,"We're going to the water park,The water park, the water park.We're going to the water park,Me and my best friends, except for Kyle who I don't like.",13,Southpark,148,27,,,,,,,,,
13257,Stan,14,"Okay Cartman, you can stop singing now. ",13,Southpark,40,7,,,,,,,,,
13258,Cartman,14,"This is gonna be sooo awesome dude. I haven't been to the water park in like, over a year.",13,Southpark,90,19,,,,,,,,,
13259,Butters,14,What do you guys wanna do first? I hear they have a new inner tube slide.,13,Southpark,73,16,,,,,,,,,
13260,Cartman,14,"No! Dude, we gotta go to the wave pool first. It's so dope, as long as there aren't any minorities.",13,Southpark,99,20,,,,,,,,,
13262,Cartman,14,"You know, there's always like five or six minorities wearing their T-shirts in the wave pool, pisses me off.",13,Southpark,108,19,,,,,,,,,
13263,Stan,14,We're here! It's the water park! ,13,Southpark,33,6,,,,,,,,,
13264,Randy,14,"I'm gonna pick you boys up right here at four o'clock, you got it?",13,Southpark,66,14,,,,,,,,,
13265,Cartman,14,"Come on, let's go!",13,Southpark,18,4,,,,,,,,,
13266,Stan,14,"We got it, Dad.",13,Southpark,15,4,,,,,,,,,

13268,Cartman,14,"Wave pool! Wave pool! Waaave pooool!  Oh, what the hell?! ",13,Southpark,58,10,,,,,,,,,
13269,Kyle,14,"All right, what do you guys wanna ride first?",13,Southpark,45,9,,,,,,,,,
13270,Stan,14,"Well Cartman said he wanted to do the wave pool first, right Cartman?",13,Southpark,69,13,,,,,,,,,
13271,Cartman,14,Forget it! Just forget it! ,13,Southpark,27,5,,,,,,,,,
13272,Stan,14,"Dude, this is awesome.",13,Southpark,22,4,,,,,,,,,
13273,Kyle,14,You guys wanna see how long I can hold my breath under water?,13,Southpark,61,13,,,,,,,,,
13274,Butters,14,"Hey fellers, fellas hang on. I've gotta go to the bathroom. ",13,Southpark,60,11,,,,,,,,,
13275,Kyle,14,"Okay, go ahead. ",13,Southpark,16,3,,,,,,,,,
13276,Butters,14,"Okay, thanks. ",13,Southpark,14,2,,,,,,,,,

13282,Kyle,14,"No dude, Butters' pee is in there.",13,Southpark,34,7,,,,,,,,,
13283,Stan,14,"Aw come on, look at all this water. It doesn't matter if one person pees in it.",13,Southpark,79,17,,,,,,,,,
13284,Butters,14,"Yeah, come on, Kyle, I'm not the only person who's peed in the pool. Lots of people do.",13,Southpark,87,18,,,,,,,,,
13285,Kyle,14,No they don't!,13,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,
13286,Stan,14,"Yeah, they do, Kyle.",13,Southpark,20,4,,,,,,,,,
13288,Kyle,14,Dude!,13,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
13289,Stan,14,"Come on, show us how long you can hold your breath.",13,Southpark,51,11,,,,,,,,,
13290,Kyle,14,NO!,13,Southpark,3,1,,,,,,,,,
13291,Cartman,14,"What has happened to this place?I don_—Èt recognize it anymore.It used to be so fun and special.What is life worth living for?The dream is dead, our land is gone;There_—Ès a hole in my heart and I can_—Èt go on.There are too many minorities At my water park .This was our land, our dream ,and they_—Ève taken it all away.They just keep coming and coming .I tried to go and tell the police,But even the authoritiesAre minoritiesAt my water park.There_—Ès no place for me to sit anymore,And the lines just keep getting crazier.There are Mexicans all around me.The lazy river has never been lazier.It_—Ès a 40 minute wait to go down one slide,And the instructions are in Spanish on the Zip Line ride!",13,Southpark,697,122,,,,,,,,,
13293,Cartman,14,Just do it in English!,13,Southpark,22,5,,,,,,,,,
13294,Cartman,14,"There are too many minorities At my water park .Where did they all come from?Why can_—Èt they leave this land alone?And it_—Ès such a tragedy .We looked the other way too long.We_—Ève got to change our prioritiesAnd get all these minoritiesOut of my water park Mexicans and Asians,, I think I even saw a Native American .God I_—Èm asking please, get all of these minoritiesOut of my water park .",13,Southpark,395,70,,,,,,,,,
13295,Stan,14,"After this, you guys wanna hit the hurricane slides?",13,Southpark,52,9,,,,,,,,,
13296,Butters,14,You bet!,13,Southpark,8,2,,,,,,,,,
13297,Kyle,14,I'm not getting back in the water.,13,Southpark,34,7,,,,,,,,,
13298,Stan,14,"Aw come on, Kyle.",13,Southpark,17,4,,,,,,,,,
13299,Kyle,14,"Dude, I just found out that everybody pees in pools. Why would I go back?",13,Southpark,73,15,,,,,,,,,
13300,Stan,14,Not everybody pees in pools.,13,Southpark,28,5,,,,,,,,,
13301,Kyle,14,Do you pee in the pool?,13,Southpark,23,6,,,,,,,,,
13302,Stan,14,Not today... yet.,13,Southpark,17,3,,,,,,,,,
13303,Kyle,14,"Aw, come on!",13,Southpark,12,3,,,,,,,,,
13304,Stan,14,"Well dude, what are you gonna do? Just hang out here at the table all day?",13,Southpark,74,16,,,,,,,,,
13305,Kyle,14,Most likely.,13,Southpark,12,2,,,,,,,,,
13306,Cartman,14,"You guys! You guys, we have got problems of Biblical proportions!",13,Southpark,65,11,,,,,,,,,
13307,Stan,14,"Dude, where have you been?",13,Southpark,26,5,,,,,,,,,
13308,Cartman,14,I've been counting. Do you know there are two hundred and five Mexicans here? and there are a hundred and ninety black people!,13,Southpark,126,23,,,,,,,,,
13309,Kyle,14,So what?,13,Southpark,8,2,,,,,,,,,
13310,Cartman,14,So?! Guess how many white people are at the water park today? One hundred and forty three! There are actually more minorities here than us!,13,Southpark,139,25,,,,,,,,,
13311,Kyle,14,"Well then they're not minorities, are they?",13,Southpark,43,7,,,,,,,,,
13312,Cartman,14,...What do you mean?,13,Southpark,20,4,,,,,,,,,
13313,Kyle,14,"Dumbass, if there's sixty percent of them to forty percent of us, then who's the minority?!",13,Southpark,91,16,,,,,,,,,
13314,Cartman,14,The black and brown people.,13,Southpark,27,5,,,,,,,,,
13315,Kyle,14,"No, you're the minority!",13,Southpark,24,4,,,,,,,,,
13316,Cartman,14,"Do I look like a minority to you, stupid?! Now look guys, I did some calculations: just last year, there were almost ninety percent normal people to minorities. That's fifty percent rise in one, year!",13,Southpark,200,35,,,,,,,,,
13317,Stan,14,This is more math than I've ever seen you do.,13,Southpark,45,10,,,,,,,,,
13318,Cartman,14,Because it's important! A fifty percent rise each year means that in three years the world will be only... minorities. That's 2012! The Mayans predicted this!,13,Southpark,158,26,,,,,,,,,
13319,Butters,14,The who?,13,Southpark,8,2,,,,,,,,,
13320,Cartman,14,The Mayans! They knew that minorities would take over the world by the year 2012! And now it's happening!,13,Southpark,105,19,,,,,,,,,
13321,Stan,14,I'm gonna go on the slides.,13,Southpark,27,6,,,,,,,,,
13322,Butters,14,Whoopie! ,13,Southpark,9,1,,,,,,,,,
13323,Cartman,14,"You guys! You guys have to do something to stop this! Come on!  Well, looks like at least you've got some sense left in you, Kyle. So what are we gonna do to keep the Mayan prediction from coming true, buddy?",13,Southpark,208,41,,,,,,,,,
13324,Kyle,14,"Blow it out your ass, Cartman! ",13,Southpark,31,6,,,,,,,,,
13327,Kyle,14,Eewww! ,13,Southpark,7,1,,,,,,,,,
13342,Butters,14,"Oh b-hoy, the waves are startin' up again!",13,Southpark,42,8,,,,,,,,,
13343,Stan,14,"This is sweet, huh Kenny? ",13,Southpark,26,5,,,,,,,,,

13351,Kyle,14,"Aw, sick! ",13,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,
13353,Randy,14,What's going on?,13,Southpark,16,3,,,,,,,,,
13355,Randy,14,"Sir, please, my son is in there! What's happened?",13,Southpark,49,9,,,,,,,,,
13363,Randy,14,Oh my God. I've gotta help him! ,13,Southpark,32,7,,,,,,,,,
13365,Randy,14,You can't just leave my son in there with all that pee!,13,Southpark,55,12,,,,,,,,,
13373,Kyle,14,Aahhh...,13,Southpark,8,1,,,,,,,,,
13374,Stan,14,"Kyle, quick! You've gotta swim over to us!",13,Southpark,42,8,,,,,,,,,
13375,Kyle,14,No way!,13,Southpark,7,2,,,,,,,,,
13377,Butters,14,"Come on, Kyle!",13,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,
13378,Kyle,14,"Dude, that's all pee!",13,Southpark,21,4,,,,,,,,,
13379,Stan,14,Well if you don't swim in you're gonna die!,13,Southpark,43,9,,,,,,,,,
13380,Kyle,14,I'll die if I do swim in it!,13,Southpark,28,8,,,,,,,,,
13381,Stan,14,"Kyle, it's just pee! It's not that big a deal!",13,Southpark,46,10,,,,,,,,,
13382,Kyle,14,Yes it is a big deal! Why do you think everyone washes their hands after they go to the bathroom?!,13,Southpark,98,20,,,,,,,,,
13383,Stan,14,"...Well, not everyone washes their hands after they go to the bathroom.",13,Southpark,71,12,,,,,,,,,
13384,Kyle,14,...What?!,13,Southpark,9,1,,,,,,,,,
13385,Stan,14,"Come on, dude, you've gotta swim.",13,Southpark,33,6,,,,,,,,,
13386,Kyle,14,You don't wash your hands after going to the bathroom!,13,Southpark,54,10,,,,,,,,,
13387,Stan,14,Not... all the time.,13,Southpark,20,4,,,,,,,,,
13388,Kyle,14,That is gross!!,13,Southpark,15,3,,,,,,,,,
13389,Stan,14,Why? It's not like you're peeing on your hands! There's more germs on most furniture than there is in pee!,13,Southpark,106,20,,,,,,,,,
13390,Butters,14,"Yeah, if anything you should wash your hands before you touch your weiner! ",13,Southpark,75,13,,,,,,,,,
13391,Stan,14,"Kyle, come on!",13,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,
13392,Kyle,14,"Ha, Goddamnit!  Haaa. Ohhhh. Ahh, ohh, uhh, agh, ",13,Southpark,49,8,,,,,,,,,
13393,Butters,14,Do you need to wash your hands?,13,Southpark,31,7,,,,,,,,,
13394,Cartman,14,Help! Help!,13,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
13396,Cartman,14,"Yes! Yes help me! Yes, help me I'm just a little boy! You have to help me!  Oh, oh, oh. ",13,Southpark,88,20,,,,,,,,,
13398,Cartman,14,"Haa-aa. Yes, thank you.",13,Southpark,23,4,,,,,,,,,
13403,Cartman,14,"Day one. It has happened. The Mayans were right. The only thing they got wrong was the date. It is 2009, and I appear to be the last of my species alive. Now it's just me, all alone, with minorities. What will the minorities do with me? I'm sure that's what on all of their minds.

14279,Cartman,4,"Welcome to Cartman's Incredible Podcast!  Hello fellow Facebookers, I'm here to do one thing: get you more friends!  Looking around Facebook today we see that since adding loser Kip Drordy as a friend, Kyle Broflovski's stock is plummeting! He had 55 friends just two days ago, he's down to just 11 this morning. Run to your Facebook account and delete Kyle from your friend list because he is poison and I don't see him making a comeback any time soon.  You're gonna want to dump Kyle and if at all possible add Clyde Donovan. Why?  Birthday! That's right, Clyde has a birthday coming up and his mom is taking everyone to Casa Bonita.  If you don't have Clyde as a friend, you're gonna want to add him, because Clyde's numbers are about to go way up! And now, Word On The Street.  The rumors are now becoming more than that; Jimmy and Bebe have agreed to share their friends. That's right. Looks like we're about to have a merger  So if you're a friend of Jimmy's you're about to luck into about 90 chick friends, and as we all know, chick friends are worth almost triple what dude friends are. That's all the time I have for today. Remember, update that profile, and steer clear of Kyle.",14,Southpark,1189,217,,,,,,,,,
14280,Kyle,4,Can I come in?,14,Southpark,14,4,,,,,,,,,
14281,Stan,4,"Sure dude.  Dude, what's the matter?",14,Southpark,36,6,,,,,,,,,
14282,Kyle,4,I... don't... have... any... friends...,14,Southpark,39,5,,,,,,,,,
14283,Stan,4,What?,14,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
14284,Kyle,4,"I mean, I do, but, well, ever since I became friends with that Kip Drordy kid, a bunch of my other friends have started ignoring me. It would be fine except for my farm is starting to shrink. I know that I should just dump Kip as a friend, but that's such a terrible thing to do and, I'm sorry I'm just so confused I... I really need a friend right now.",14,Southpark,353,72,,,,,,,,,
14285,Stan,4,"Okay dude, I'm I'm here for you.",14,Southpark,32,7,,,,,,,,,

14293,Kyle,4,"'Kay, so now just click on the little soil button...  and then maybe put a sign up to comment on my farm...  Okay, now I can read the sign you put up...",14,Southpark,152,32,,,,,,,,,
14294,Stan,4,"'Kay, it says you and I are now very good friends.",14,Southpark,50,11,,,,,,,,,

14337,Kyle,4,I don't know what to do. I just can't seem to get my friend numbers to go up. I'm desperate. That's why I came to you.,14,Southpark,118,26,,,,,,,,,
14338,Cartman,4,"You're very smart, Kyle. But the truth is, as long as you have that Kip Drordy loser as a Facebook friend, people view your friendship as a liability. You gotta dump him.",14,Southpark,170,32,,,,,,,,,
14339,Kyle,4,"I can't do that, I'd just feel too bad.",14,Southpark,39,9,,,,,,,,,
14340,Cartman,4,"Well Kyle, then what you have to do is go outside the normal circles and try to make friends with people who've never heard of Kip.",14,Southpark,131,26,,,,,,,,,
14341,Kyle,4,I've been trying! But I just don't know how to make totally new friends on the Internet.,14,Southpark,88,17,,,,,,,,,
14342,Cartman,4,"It's not as hard as it sounds, Kyle. Have you ever heard of chatroulette?",14,Southpark,73,14,,,,,,,,,
14343,Kyle,4,No. What's chatroulette?,14,Southpark,24,3,,,,,,,,,

14492,Randy,5,"You just had to push it, didn't you Stan. You just had to make fun of Tom Cruise again!",14,Southpark,87,19,,,,,,,,,
14494,Stan,5,Aww... he was packing fudge!,14,Southpark,28,5,,,,,,,,,
14497,Stan,5,"It wasn't just me. Other kids called him a fudge packer, even Mr. Gar-",14,Southpark,70,14,,,,,,,,,
14501,Randy,5,"Hey, don't start blaming me for his looks!",14,Southpark,42,8,,,,,,,,,
14502,Randy,5,"Mr. Cruise. My son is so, so sorry and he would do anything to take back his hurtful comments.",14,Southpark,94,19,,,,,,,,,
14504,Randy,5,"Yes, it was a terrible mistake. But maybe you could see how, since you do... take fudge and... pack it into a box... ",14,Southpark,117,23,,,,,,,,,
14506,Randy,5,"We-, I-I'm just saying that you are employed currently as a person who... packages...",14,Southpark,85,14,,,,,,,,,
14508,Randy,5,"Right, my son just got confused. Because you have a little uniform, and a... hat that says ""Fred's Fudge and Candies""... and you are... Look it doesn't matter. Just please withdraw the class-action lawsuit. Nobody in our town will ever call you a fudge packer ever again. ",14,Southpark,272,47,,,,,,,,,
14510,Randy,5,ANYTHING! anything you want Mr. Cruise.,14,Southpark,39,6,,,,,,,,,
14512,Randy,5,"Sure! Who is it, we can get anybody for you.",14,Southpark,44,10,,,,,,,,,

14517,Randy,5,"Mr. Cruise, if there is anybody else we could bring to town, we-",14,Southpark,64,13,,,,,,,,,
14519,Randy,5,"Okay people, I know, I know. But he will get the other celebrities to withdraw their lawsuit if we just... get Muhammad to appear in South Park.",14,Southpark,144,27,,,,,,,,,
14520,Mr. Garrison,5,"Are you nuts? If Muhammad appears in South Park, we get bombed! ",14,Southpark,64,12,,,,,,,,,
14522,Kyle,5,"Dude, I can't believe we are dealing with this Muhammad thing again.",14,Southpark,68,12,,,,,,,,,
14525,Stan,5,I saw him once. ,14,Southpark,16,4,,,,,,,,,
14527,Stan,5,"Yeah, one time, my friends joined David Blaine's cult, and I had to go to the Super Best Friends to rescue them, and Muhammad was one of the Super Best Friends.",14,Southpark,160,31,,,,,,,,,
14528,Mr. Garrison,5,"Oh, and what- he was just out in the open where everybody could see him and nobody got bombed?",14,Southpark,94,19,,,,,,,,,
14529,Stan,5,"No, dude, it was totally fine.",14,Southpark,30,6,,,,,,,,,
14531,Stan,5,"Well, a giant John Wilkes Booth shot Abraham Lincoln...",14,Southpark,55,9,,,,,,,,,
14532,Randy,5,"Alright Stan, that's enough. Jesus, can't learn to shut up, can you? Now look, I believe we CAN find Muhammad. I have done a lot of research and I have completed a sketch of what Muhammad might look like today. ",14,Southpark,211,40,,,,,,,,,
14533,Mr. Garrison,5,"No, don't!  Is that okay to show?",14,Southpark,33,7,,,,,,,,,
14544,Cartman,5,"Excuse me...  This is the home of Tom Cruise, right?",14,Southpark,52,10,,,,,,,,,
14546,Cartman,5,I didn't come for myself. I just came as an escort for another celebrity who wants in on your lawsuit...,14,Southpark,104,20,,,,,,,,,
14554,Stan,5,"Jesus, all we are asking you to do is bring Muhammad to our town for like an hour.",14,Southpark,82,18,,,,,,,,,
14557,Stan,5,"Awww, not you guys too... Jesus fucking Christ!",14,Southpark,47,8,,,,,,,,,
14559,Kyle,5,"Okay, will you let Muhammad come to South Park if we dress him like a pirate?",14,Southpark,77,16,,,,,,,,,
14561,Kyle,5,K... what if we cover his face with a paper bag?,14,Southpark,48,11,,,,,,,,,
14563,Stan,5,Okay. A suit of armor? We just have Muhammad in a suit of armor so you can't see anything.,14,Southpark,90,19,,,,,,,,,
14565,Kyle,5,Aww come on! This is ridiculous! ,14,Southpark,33,6,,,,,,,,,
14568,Kyle,5,"A U-Haul. What if we bring Muhammad to South Park in the back of a U-Haul, and he just stays in there out of sight?",14,Southpark,115,25,,,,,,,,,
14570,Stan,5,"Well yeah, he's got to talk or nobody knows he's in there!",14,Southpark,58,12,,,,,,,,,
14573,Kyle,5,There doesn't have to be...,14,Southpark,27,5,,,,,,,,,
14580,Cartman,5,"Wait, wait, wait, you mean we aren't going to sue and get a bunch of money?",14,Southpark,75,16,,,,,,,,,
14583,Cartman,5,"Uh, excuse us for a second... ",14,Southpark,30,6,,,,,,,,,
14584,Cartman,5,"Alright, just what the hell do you think you are doing?",14,Southpark,55,11,,,,,,,,,
14586,Cartman,5,"Cut the crap, I thought we were here for lawsuit money!",14,Southpark,55,11,,,,,,,,,
14588,Cartman,5,"If we are staying here, then I want to know what is going on. Don't forget, I know who you really are...  Mitch Conner.",14,Southpark,119,24,,,,,,,,,
14590,Cartman,5,"You're a no-good swindler and a 2-bit thief. We were here for money, not goo!",14,Southpark,77,15,,,,,,,,,
14592,Cartman,5,"Yeah, so what?",14,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,
14594,Cartman,5,"So we let them take it from Muhammad, then we take it for ourselves.",14,Southpark,68,14,,,,,,,,,
14600,Randy,5,"Boys, we are so sorry for doubting you. You really did bring us Muhammad.",14,Southpark,73,14,,,,,,,,,
14605,Randy,5,"Alright, now we just need to figure out how to get Muhammad from the back of the truck into Tom Cruise's limo.",14,Southpark,110,22,,,,,,,,,
14606,Stan,5,"What! No, dad. we promised the Super Best Friends that Muhammad would stay in the truck.",14,Southpark,88,16,,,,,,,,,
14608,Kyle,5,But Muhammad can't be seen dad.,14,Southpark,31,6,,,,,,,,,
14610,Stan,5,"No, you can't even show his feet.",14,Southpark,33,7,,,,,,,,,
14612,Mr. Garrison,5,"No, you could still see his eyes...",14,Southpark,35,7,,,,,,,,,
14613,Randy,5,"Okay. How 'bout like... like a big mascot outfit? One that covered him completely, head to toe, without even showing his eyes? ",14,Southpark,127,22,,,,,,,,,
14621,Cartman,5,No! No more tacos Mrs. Lopez.,14,Southpark,29,6,,,,,,,,,
14623,Cartman,5,You just had seven tacos.,14,Southpark,25,5,,,,,,,,,
14625,Cartman,5,I'm sorry  Why are you doing this?,14,Southpark,34,7,,,,,,,,,
14627,Cartman,5,"You know goddamn well you are not Jennifer Lopez, so stop pissing me off! ",14,Southpark,74,14,,,,,,,,,
14630,Cartman,5,Aw- Jee-. They don't even make enchiritos anymore!,14,Southpark,50,8,,,,,,,,,

14634,Cartman,5,"God, will somebody shut her up?",14,Southpark,31,6,,,,,,,,,
14635,Randy,5,"Alright, the limo's here. Muhammad, thanks again for doing this. ",14,Southpark,65,10,,,,,,,,,
14637,Mr. Garrison,5,Hold on a second! ,14,Southpark,18,4,,,,,,,,,
14638,Mr. Garrison,5,"Stop! There are some extremists! They are threatening that if we give Muhammad to the celebrities, they are going to bomb us!",14,Southpark,125,22,,,,,,,,,
14640,Randy,5,"Aw. Aw it's just a stupid threat! Come on Muhammad, we don't want to piss off Tom Cruise again. ",14,Southpark,96,19,,,,,,,,,
14642,Stan,5,"Muhammad, are you okay? ",14,Southpark,24,4,,,,,,,,,
14643,Randy,5,What the hell was that?!,14,Southpark,24,5,,,,,,,,,
14645,Stan,5,They want his power?,14,Southpark,20,4,,,,,,,,,
14646,Kyle,5,What kind of extremists are these? ,14,Southpark,35,6,,,,,,,,,

14661,Cartman,5,How could you know anything about who my family is?,14,Southpark,51,10,,,,,,,,,
14663,Cartman,5,"If you're making this up to keep me around Conner, the you'd better-",14,Southpark,68,13,,,,,,,,,
14670,Kyle,5,We can't give him over to the gingers!,14,Southpark,38,8,,,,,,,,,

14704,Mr. Garrison,5,"Eric, what are you doing here?",14,Southpark,30,6,,,,,,,,,
14705,Cartman,5,"Did you all lie to me? All of you, in that room, when you told me my mother was my father?",14,Southpark,90,21,,,,,,,,,
14706,Mr. Garrison,5,"What? N-No Eric, are you still worried about that old issue, I mean-",14,Southpark,68,13,,,,,,,,,
14707,Cartman,5,I don't trust you. I want to talk to Mr. Hat.,14,Southpark,45,11,,,,,,,,,

14942,Kyle,6,"That's because there is no goo, Mr. Cruise. You see, I learned something today. Throughout this whole ordeal, we've all wanted to show things that we weren't allowed to show. But it wasn't because of some magic goo. It was because of the magical power of threatening people with violence. That's obviously the only true power. If there's anything we've all learned, it's that terrorizing people works.",14,Southpark,401,67,,,,,,,,,
14945,Stan,6,Yeah.,14,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,

17520,Stan,4,You made everyone else get measured with witnesses; you have to too.,15,Southpark,68,12,,,,,,,,,
17521,Cartman,4,Well what are you guys going to do?! Use a tape measure and measure my penis yourselves?! Are you homos?!,15,Southpark,105,20,,,,,,,,,
17522,Stan,4,You just did that to everybody in class!,15,Southpark,40,8,,,,,,,,,

Clearly I'm very happy with the size of my wiener, or else why would I have called for a new measurement, and for this poster to be put up at all?! Don't forget that this was all my idea!",15,Southpark,345,67,,,,,,,,,
17529,Cartman,4,"Oh, Goddamnit!",15,Southpark,14,2,,,,,,,,,
17530,Cartman,4,Let me guess: I'm in trouble again!,15,Southpark,35,7,,,,,,,,,
17532,Cartman,4,For what?!,15,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,
17534,Cartman,4,Why did YOU measure our penis sizes and put the results on the school bulletin board?!,15,Southpark,86,16,,,,,,,,,
17536,Cartman,4,"I don't care if Obama IS President! You don't go around putting little boys on blast, telling the whole world the length of their DICKS!",15,Southpark,136,25,,,,,,,,,
17538,Cartman,4,"You're damn right! One point two inches! I'll have you know that my penis is a respectable 1.4 inches! Maybe it's still the smallest in school, but it's .2 inches bogger than you said!!",15,Southpark,185,34,,,,,,,,,

17562,Randy,4,Did they measure from the base or from the balls? ,15,Southpark,50,10,,,,,,,,,
17565,Randy,4,I'm a scientist. I think it's best I handle this.,15,Southpark,49,10,,,,,,,,,
17566,Randy,4,"Hello students, my name is Dr. Marsh, and I'm gonna talk to you a little bit about what happened at the school yesterday. How do a man and a woman... make a baby? Anybody? A man and woman, what do they do to make a baby? How about the little girl in the brown coat? Yeah you.",15,Southpark,275,57,,,,,,,,,
17568,Randy,4,"Good! The man puts his penis  Okay? Into the woman's vagina.  Okay now, sometimes, a man can feel like how long his penis is, is actually important. But is it? When you boys measure your penis length, the truth is it doesn't really matter. What does matter is  Length times diameter plus weight over girth divided by angle of the tip squared, okay? When we're talking about penis size, we can't just use a tape measure. We need a scale  and...  a protractor as well.  Let's look at it on the graph here..  Follow along with me on your study sheets, kids.",15,Southpark,554,102,,,,,,,,,
17578,Cartman,4,Why the fuck am I here?!,15,Southpark,24,6,,,,,,,,,

17582,Cartman,4,"Oh, that's cool.",15,Southpark,16,3,,,,,,,,,
17583,Randy,4,"And so, by dividing the weight and the girth of the penis by the angle or the- what do we call it again? The yaw? The yaw of the shaft? What we finally get is the adjusted penis size, or, T.M.I. Any questions so far? Yes, little girl over there.",15,Southpark,245,50,,,,,,,,,
17585,Randy,4,"...Ah, good question. Ahh, the penis is the thing we're talking about that boys have that we're... measuring.  Okay any other questions? Okay, so then let's move on to the example on your study sheet. How about you? Could you read the first example for the class?  Example 1, young lady. Please read the problem out loud",15,Southpark,320,57,,,,,,,,,
17587,Randy,4,Four point four inches...,15,Southpark,25,4,,,,,,,,,
17589,Randy,4,Seven centimeters...,15,Southpark,20,2,,,,,,,,,
17591,Randy,4,"Great! And so divide by the 17. carry the 1, and we can see that Randy's adjusted penis size, or T.M.I., is... 6.3 inches. Do we got that? Randy's length is 4.4 inches, but his adjusted length is 6.3. So how does our example person ""Randy"" compare to others on the T.M.I. scale? By referring again to the T.M.I. chart, we see that a T.M.I. of 6.3 is .8 inches more than the national average. ",15,Southpark,392,75,,,,,,,,,
17611,Cartman,4,My penis is 13 inches long.,15,Southpark,27,6,,,,,,,,,

17742,Cartman,5,"Ask the guys. There's six hospitals within a ten-mile radius, and all we do is pit the crack babies against each other with a little ball of crack.",15,Southpark,147,28,,,,,,,,,

17769,Kyle,5,"No no, it's n-it's not like it sounds. Here, check it out.  See look, we just video the babies fighting over a ball full of crack. It's really getting popular!  I mean it, it's cool because like the commercial said, the crack babies had nothing before.  It, it's great, because everyone wins, you know? You see that? Two million hits.  Did you know they're putting bacon inside of pancakes at Denny's?",15,Southpark,401,71,,,,,,,,,
17770,Cartman,5,Betsy MacIntosh?,15,Southpark,16,2,,,,,,,,,

17782,Cartman,5,Just sign the paper and he'll be playing ball for St. Mary's.,15,Southpark,61,12,,,,,,,,,

17788,Cartman,5,"Rgh! Ma'am, the Crack Baby Athletic Association is a storied franchise. It was founded over twelve days ago, with a firm ethical code that strictly states ""benefits to players is detrimentalized to their well-being."" I cannot offer you or your child any cash. I can however offer you a little bit of crack. Butters? ",15,Southpark,316,54,,,,,,,,,
17789,Kyle,5,"Dude, what actually makes total sense about it, if you look at it, is that the crack babies are finally getting some attention and the care that they need.  Yeah. It's pretty cool, dude. Because most of these babies would normally not even get out, you know? Huh, or be able to do anything.  Just because we are making money doesn't mean that those babies aren't benefiting. It isn't exploiting them. They're finding a useful place in society. What's so unethical about that?

17794,Cartman,5,It's the easiest thing in the world! How could you guys have screwed this up?! All I asked you to do was to get Slash to play at half time for the match up between the crack babies at Cedars-Sinai NCU!,15,Southpark,201,41,,,,,,,,,
17796,Cartman,5,"Slash is not hard to find! He'll show up to play anywhere if you pay him! He played at my eighth birthday party, for Christ's sake! Look! Look! He's playing at Lakewood Mall right now!  Now you guys get down there-  Oh crap, the president of EA Sports is calling. Just go! Go!  Mr. Peters, how are you? Yes sir, we're very excited about our deal with you as well.  Oh, we know the video game version of Crack Baby Basketball will be a big hit too.  Hey Kyle. Have a seat.",15,Southpark,471,92,,,,,,,,,

17798,Cartman,5,"Mr. Peters, can I call you back? Our company accountant needs me. Yes, he is Jewish. Okay, thanks, Mr. Peters. Bye.  How's it goin', man?",15,Southpark,137,25,,,,,,,,,
17799,Kyle,5,In our deal with EA Sports we are giving them the right to use images of the crack babies and their names. But we aren't paying the crack babies.,15,Southpark,145,29,,,,,,,,,
17800,Cartman,5,They can't make money. It's against the rules.,15,Southpark,46,8,,,,,,,,,
17801,Kyle,5,But this video game can make a million dollars. We have to give the crack babies a piece of that.,15,Southpark,97,20,,,,,,,,,
17802,Cartman,5,"Kyle, it says right there: Rule number 3. Crack baby players cannot receive compensation of any kind for their playing.",15,Southpark,119,20,,,,,,,,,
17803,Kyle,5,Gut they're the ones risking injury.,15,Southpark,36,6,,,,,,,,,
17804,Cartman,5,"What do you want me to do, Kyle? Find a stepladder of some kind and risk my safety to get up there and change the rules?!",15,Southpark,121,26,,,,,,,,,
17805,Kyle,5,"The government could come after us, Cartman.",15,Southpark,44,7,,,,,,,,,
17806,Cartman,5,"We're a non-profit company, Kyle.",15,Southpark,33,5,,,,,,,,,
17807,Kyle,5,So then where did the eight hundred dollars we made from selling an Internet ad to Payless Shoe Source go?,15,Southpark,106,20,,,,,,,,,
17808,Cartman,5,"Egh, to things we need to keep the office running, Kyle. Here, look. ",15,Southpark,69,13,,,,,,,,,
17809,Kyle,5,A hot tub?!,15,Southpark,11,3,,,,,,,,,
17810,Cartman,5,"It's not just a hot tub. Taste it. Go ahead, taste it. ",15,Southpark,55,12,,,,,,,,,
17811,Kyle,5,Gravy?,15,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
17812,Cartman,5,Kentucky Fried Chicken gravy.,15,Southpark,29,4,,,,,,,,,
17813,Kyle,5,No way.,15,Southpark,7,2,,,,,,,,,
17814,Cartman,5,"A hot tub full of KFC gravy, Kyle. Did you ever think you would see that in your lifetime?  Kyle, as owners of this company, we owe it not only to ourselves, but to the crack babies to be as stress-free and clear-headed as possible. McDonald's French fries and KFC gravy. The French call this ""poutaine"".",15,Southpark,304,56,,,,,,,,,
17815,Kyle,5,"I know, but dude, we can't license our games to EA Sports and pay the crack babies nothing. Slavery is illegal.",15,Southpark,111,21,,,,,,,,,
17816,Cartman,5,It's not illegal Kyle. Tell you what: I'll do some undercover work and find out how the other companies get away with it.,15,Southpark,121,23,,,,,,,,,
17817,Kyle,5,What other companies?,15,Southpark,21,3,,,,,,,,,
17820,Cartman,5,Helloo thear! The name is Eric P Cartman. I'm a well-respected owner in the slave trade.,15,Southpark,88,16,,,,,,,,,
17822,Cartman,5,"My peaches, what a wonderful office you got yourself heah. Certainly got yourself a luuucrative bidness, don't ye. Well let me get right down to it theyen. Like yourself,  I am also in the slave trade.  But at the moment I find myself in a little quandary with ligal issues. Was wonderin' if you could share some secrets.",15,Southpark,321,58,,,,,,,,,
17824,Cartman,5,"You have some might strong-lookin' workers heah, sahr. I'd be willin' to offer you forty dollars for two of the white ones and fifty for the blacks.",15,Southpark,148,27,,,,,,,,,
17826,Cartman,5,"Student atholetes. Hoho, that is brilliant sahr. Now, when we sell their likeness for video games, how do we get around payin' for our slaves uh- ""student atheletes"" then?",15,Southpark,171,29,,,,,,,,,
17828,Cartman,5,"I ain't arguin'. If they got paid, then how did we make all owr money, right?",15,Southpark,77,16,,,,,,,,,
17830,Cartman,5,"But of course you own slaves, because, oh... riiight.  Of couse you don't have desire to own slaves, son, neither do I. And if there was any government agency listenin' in on this heah conversation, they should know that we'er not talkin' 'bout slave ownership. Gaauu.  Alright, so now, how do you get around not paying your slaves.",15,Southpark,332,58,,,,,,,,,
17832,Cartman,5,"You think you can do whatever you want 'cause your corporation is a university?!  This country was founded on the idea that one corporation couldn't hog all the slaves, while the rest of us wallow in poverteh! Screw you sahr, I'm goin' home! ",15,Southpark,242,43,,,,,,,,,
17833,Kyle,5,"Here's the thing: Whether or not I'm a part of it, crack baby basketball is popular. Somebody's going to do it. So the only way for me to try and help the situation is to be involved in it, so that I can steer things in a direction that is more beneficial to the actual crack babies.  Oh, it's sooo easy for you, isn't it? I mean, what do you have to do except lay there and think about what you did at school today, or what you want to watch on TV tomorrow? Well sorry, Skippy, but the world isn't always black and white! Just because some people are born poorer than others doesn't mean I can't enjoy a few McDonald's French fries in a hot tub of gravy from Kentucky Fried Chicken!",15,Southpark,683,134,,,,,,,,,
17834,Stan,5,McDonald's French fries in a hot tub of... KFC gravy?,15,Southpark,53,10,,,,,,,,,
17835,Kyle,5,It happens to be called poutine in Montreal! ,15,Southpark,45,8,,,,,,,,,
17836,Cartman,5,"How hard can it be, Clyde?! You walk up to Slash when he's playing at the mall and you offer him a deal!",15,Southpark,104,23,,,,,,,,,
17838,Cartman,5,How can Slash be playing in Colorado Springs and Moscow at the same time?!,15,Southpark,74,14,,,,,,,,,
17840,Cartman,5,"Look, you morons, Slash clearly has a fan club, right?! So just go to the post office, and find out where the mail gets in, and then you'll have Slash's home address!",15,Southpark,166,32,,,,,,,,,
17842,Cartman,5,"Yeah it's a good idea! Now go get us Slash for halftime!  Jesus Christ!  Are we the only two intelligent people in this entire company, Kyle? Goddamn!",15,Southpark,150,27,,,,,,,,,
17843,Kyle,5,"Alright Cartman, I've been doin' a lot of thinking about how the company's gonna spend the money we make off the EA Sports deal. We're going to use thirty percent of the money to build an orphanage for the crack babies.",15,Southpark,219,41,,,,,,,,,
17844,Cartman,5,...What?,15,Southpark,8,1,,,,,,,,,
17845,Kyle,5,"I've designed it to be the best place for them to live. A place where they can finally have the care and happiness they deserve. And if you think it's a bad idea, I really don't care!",15,Southpark,183,37,,,,,,,,,
17846,Cartman,5,"Oh my God... It's genius, Kyle!",15,Southpark,31,6,,,,,,,,,
17847,Kyle,5,...What?,15,Southpark,8,1,,,,,,,,,
17848,Cartman,5,"This the answer to our problems! A three hundred thousand dollar building, but we buy ourselves a million dollars' worth of goodwill with the public. We can say we gave our ""student athletes"" a place to live and grow for a few years. It's like moral teflon! I knew we needed a Jew in this company, Kyle! Great work! ",15,Southpark,316,59,,,,,,,,,
17868,Kyle,5,"And so, thirty percent of the money we make off the licensing agreement with EA Sports goes to the orphanage for the needy crack babies. Did you see the blueprints? The babies will have their own putt putt golf course.  Why does it matter how much I'm making, Stan? If the crack babies are getting a place to grow and develop, why does my salary matter?",15,Southpark,353,66,,,,,,,,,
17870,Cartman,5,What?,15,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
17872,Butters,5,Slash is make-believe??,15,Southpark,23,3,,,,,,,,,
17874,Cartman,5,Vunter Slash?,15,Southpark,13,2,,,,,,,,,
17875,Kyle,5,What?,15,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
17876,Cartman,5,"But then, who played at my eighth birthday party?",15,Southpark,49,9,,,,,,,,,
17878,Cartman,5,"But then, who was the guitar player for Guns N' Roses?",15,Southpark,54,11,,,,,,,,,
17880,Cartman,5,Are you fucking serious? ,15,Southpark,25,4,,,,,,,,,
17881,Stan,5,You guys are ten years old and you just figured out that Slash isn't real? Oh my God. ,15,Southpark,86,18,,,,,,,,,
17882,Cartman,5,You knew about this??,15,Southpark,21,4,,,,,,,,,
17883,Stan,5,My parents told me Slash wasn't real when I was five. Jehesus Christ. ,15,Southpark,70,13,,,,,,,,,
17884,Butters,5,Well what the heck do we do now?,15,Southpark,32,8,,,,,,,,,
17885,Kyle,5,"Look, let's just get our money from EA Sports and get out of this whole thing once and for all!",15,Southpark,95,20,,,,,,,,,
17887,Kyle,5,Wait a minute. According to this you now own all the rights to Crack Baby Basketball and we got nothing.,15,Southpark,104,20,,,,,,,,,
17889,Kyle,5,You can't do this! We were gonna build an orphanage! So the crack babies have somewhere to go!,15,Southpark,94,18,,,,,,,,,
17891,Cartman,5,"I just can't believe Slash isn't real,",15,Southpark,38,7,,,,,,,,,
17892,Butters,5,I know. It's messin' with my head so hard.,15,Southpark,42,9,,,,,,,,,
17893,Kyle,5,"You guys, we've just been screwed over and lied to!",15,Southpark,51,10,,,,,,,,,
17894,Cartman,5,"I know, right? I was always extra good before my birthday too because I was told Slash would come and play for me.",15,Southpark,114,23,,,,,,,,,
17896,Kyle,5,"It's unbelievable, Stan. EA Sports just used us the entire time. We worked for nothing and EA made all the money. You know, I don't think we actually deserved getting screwed over but, but I guess making tons of money off of people who are making nothing is always gonna cause problems. I know, I know, right? We might've got screwed, but the really tragic thing is that those, those poor crack babies at the hospitals are just gonna be stuck there, with nowhere to go.  No way!  This is it!",15,Southpark,491,91,,,,,,,,,
17897,Stan,5,It's what?,15,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,
17898,Kyle,5,"This is it, Stan!  It's just like I designed it. There's the miniature gold course over there! And slides and uh,  excuse me, what is this place?",15,Southpark,145,27,,,,,,,,,
17900,Kyle,5,But who paid for all this? ,15,Southpark,27,6,,,,,,,,,
17901,Stan,5,"Kyle, Kyle! Look. ",15,Southpark,18,3,,,,,,,,,
17902,Kyle,5,You don't think that-? But he isn't real.,15,Southpark,41,8,,,,,,,,,
17903,Stan,5,Maybe. Or maybe we haven't been told such a big fib after all.,15,Southpark,62,13,,,,,,,,,
17905,Cartman,5,"He is real, you guys. ",15,Southpark,22,5,,,,,,,,,
17907,Butters,6,Hello sir. Postman Butters with a special delivery for you. ,15,Southpark,60,10,,,,,,,,,

17995,Butters,6,"Oh well, sure, uh he's the bringer of destruction and evil!",15,Southpark,59,11,,,,,,,,,
17997,Butters,6,What? Why would I do that?,15,Southpark,26,6,,,,,,,,,

18018,Butters,6,"This... is Butters. It's Wednesday night at 9 p.m. From what I understand, there are people living inside my head and they want to kill me. It must be true, because now every night I wet the bed. So tonight I'm gonna leave the camera on to see what exactly I become while I am sleeping.",15,Southpark,286,56,,,,,,,,,
18019,Butters,6,"Oh man, this is freaky. Like that movie Paranormal.",15,Southpark,51,9,,,,,,,,,

18210,Stan,7,"No. I mean it sounds like somebody is shitting in my ears. Please, just listen really close.  You don't hear shit?",15,Southpark,114,21,,,,,,,,,

18214,Stan,7,"And so then I put on exactly the same album that I really like a year ago, and it sounded like shit to me.",15,Southpark,106,24,,,,,,,,,
18216,Stan,7,"Yeah. I used to love these Pop Rock things, and I tried them the other day and I thought they tasted like shit.",15,Southpark,111,23,,,,,,,,,
18218,Stan,7,I just turned 10.,15,Southpark,17,4,,,,,,,,,
18220,Stan,7,So this is normal?,15,Southpark,18,4,,,,,,,,,

18230,Stan,7,No.,15,Southpark,3,1,,,,,,,,,
18232,Stan,7,They both look like turds about to be reheated to me.,15,Southpark,53,11,,,,,,,,,
18234,Stan,7,Oh no.,15,Southpark,6,2,,,,,,,,,
18237,Randy,7,Get out of my room! I'm listening to my music! Gau!,15,Southpark,51,11,,,,,,,,,
18239,Randy,7,No it doesn't sound like crap to me!  Ugh. ,15,Southpark,43,9,,,,,,,,,
18241,Randy,7,"That's not true! I think Tween Wave music is complex and awesome and it speaks to my youthful rebellious spirit, Sharon!",15,Southpark,120,21,,,,,,,,,
18243,Randy,7,Anybody could play it. Do you really think so?,15,Southpark,46,9,,,,,,,,,
18244,Randy,7,"Hey everybody. Wanna thank you all for coming tonight. My name's Steamy Ray Vaughn and here's a little bit of Rattlesnake.  A-1 2 3 4! I've got a fever but it's under control!

18261,Stan,7,He said I have cynicism?,15,Southpark,24,5,,,,,,,,,
18262,Kyle,7,What's that?,15,Southpark,12,2,,,,,,,,,
18263,Stan,7,"Something you can get when you get older but, it's stupid. I'm not cynical. All the doctor wants is a paycheck. I went to him for help and he just stood there spouting a bunch of shit.",15,Southpark,184,37,,,,,,,,,
18264,Kyle,7,"Oh. Well, come on, we're playing L.A. Noire.",15,Southpark,44,8,,,,,,,,,
18265,Stan,7,"Agh, that shitty game? Who plays video games to listen to a bunch of characters talk and press the X button?",15,Southpark,108,21,,,,,,,,,

18271,Stan,7,That's such a shitty device to keep people playing.,15,Southpark,51,9,,,,,,,,,
18272,Kyle,7,"Alright, ahhh, why don't we do something else?",15,Southpark,46,8,,,,,,,,,
18273,Stan,7,"Aw, dude, this looks like shit.",15,Southpark,31,6,,,,,,,,,

18284,Randy,7,"City bop! City yeah!  Thank you! Thank you so much! I'd like to uh, bring up a special guest now. The other night I was chatting in a Tween Wave chatroom, because I do love Tween Wave so much, and I uh started chattin' with this nice lady who also really like her kids' Tween Wave music and... turns out she's a real talented artist as well. Please welcome Miss Steamy Nicks.",15,Southpark,375,72,,,,,,,,,
18290,Randy,7,Yoyoyo! ,15,Southpark,8,1,,,,,,,,,
18295,Stan,7,Yeah it sucks. All my friends are sick with the flu.,15,Southpark,52,11,,,,,,,,,
18297,Stan,7,Do you have anything on the menu that doesn't taste like shit?,15,Southpark,62,12,,,,,,,,,
18299,Stan,7,"Why? There's nothing but shit on TV, video games are all shit, and the world's a big turd. The only thing that doesn't seem like total shit to me are my friends, and they're all sick. Just, get me a cheeseburger and tell the chef to go easy on the shit. ",15,Southpark,254,51,,,,,,,,,
18300,Kyle,7,I know! That's so hilarious!,15,Southpark,28,5,,,,,,,,,
18301,Stan,7,I thought you guys were sick! ,15,Southpark,30,6,,,,,,,,,

18307,Stan,7,Why didn't you tell me? I wanna go to the movies.,15,Southpark,49,11,,,,,,,,,
18308,Kyle,7,"Look, Stam, we-we just wanted to be able to go to the movies and enjoy ourselves, you know? I'm sorry but... you're a bummer to be around. Everything is ""that looks like shit"" and, and ""this is shitty!""",15,Southpark,202,38,,,,,,,,,
18309,Stan,7,You guys... don't wanna be around me?,15,Southpark,37,7,,,,,,,,,
18310,Kyle,7,"Look dude, it's just one movie. We wanna have a good time.",15,Southpark,58,12,,,,,,,,,

18320,Stan,7,"Sorry if I see things for what they are! Ok- okay, okay, I'm sorry.",15,Southpark,67,14,,,,,,,,,
18322,Cartman,7,That looks pretty good.,15,Southpark,23,4,,,,,,,,,
18323,Stan,7,How can you say that looks good?!,15,Southpark,33,7,,,,,,,,,
18324,Kyle,7,"Shhh, you're doing it again!",15,Southpark,28,5,,,,,,,,,

18340,Kyle,7,"Dude, you've... you've changed.",15,Southpark,31,4,,,,,,,,,
18341,Stan,7,"I haven't changed, the world has. Don't you see it?",15,Southpark,51,10,,,,,,,,,
18342,Kyle,7,"No. And I don't want to. Look Stan, maybe we should fo- ",15,Southpark,56,12,,,,,,,,,
18343,Randy,7,"You don't get it, Sharon! You never have! And that's supposed to be my fault?!",15,Southpark,78,15,,,,,,,,,
18345,Randy,7,"I'm sick of everything I do being so wrong, Sharon!",15,Southpark,51,10,,,,,,,,,
18347,Randy,7,"I'm not dead yet Sharon, but you might be!",15,Southpark,42,9,,,,,,,,,
18354,Randy,7,Why can't you ever just support me?!,15,Southpark,36,7,,,,,,,,,
18356,Randy,7,"Face it Sharon, our son turned 10 and you feel old!",15,Southpark,51,11,,,,,,,,,
18358,Randy,7,"Because I'm unhappy, okay?! I've been unhappy for a long time! ",15,Southpark,63,11,,,,,,,,,
18361,Randy,7,I don't know if I've changed or you have. I just feel like I might not have a whole lot of time left and... I want to enjoy it.,15,Southpark,127,29,,,,,,,,,
18363,Randy,7,You kind of seem shitty to me too.,15,Southpark,34,8,,,,,,,,,
18370,Kyle,8,Oh shut up Cartman! You don't even know what you're talking about!,15,Southpark,66,12,,,,,,,,,
18371,Cartman,8,"Oh yeah! I saw it on the news, Kyle! The school is gonna make us all get shots again!  But this time it's so that we don't get warts in our vaginas!",15,Southpark,148,32,,,,,,,,,
18372,Kenny,8,,15,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
18373,Cartman,8,Yep!,15,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
18374,Kyle,8,"That's only a vaccination for girls, stupid!",15,Southpark,44,7,,,,,,,,,
18375,Cartman,8,Then why are they sayin' that gettin' vaccinated at school is gonna make us all retarded?,15,Southpark,89,16,,,,,,,,,
18376,Kyle,8,Because some people think vaccinations can give you autism or Asperger's!,15,Southpark,73,11,,,,,,,,,
18377,Cartman,8,Wait what?,15,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,
18378,Kyle,8,That's what they're talking about on the news!,15,Southpark,46,8,,,,,,,,,
18379,Cartman,8,"Wait, there's a disease called Assburgers?",15,Southpark,42,6,,,,,,,,,
18380,Kyle,8,Yes!,15,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
18381,Cartman,8,You are so lying! There's no disease called fuckin' Assburgers!,15,Southpark,63,10,,,,,,,,,

18383,Cartman,8,"Okay, you're on, Jew! ",15,Southpark,22,4,,,,,,,,,
18384,Mr. Garrison,8,"And so children, at noon today, all the girls will go to the gymnasium for their vaccinations, and boys will head on out to recess. ",15,Southpark,132,25,,,,,,,,,
18385,Butters,8,Do the girls get their shots right in the vagina?,15,Southpark,49,10,,,,,,,,,
18386,Mr. Garrison,8,"No. Butters, that's not how it works.",15,Southpark,37,7,,,,,,,,,
18388,Cartman,8,Did you guys know there's actually a disease called Assburgers? ,15,Southpark,64,10,,,,,,,,,
18389,Mr. Garrison,8,"Sit down boys, we'll talk about this later. Right now we're talking about vaginal warts.",15,Southpark,88,15,,,,,,,,,
18391,Butters,8,You mean little hamburgers grow in your butthole?,15,Southpark,49,8,,,,,,,,,
18392,Cartman,8,"That's right, it's a butt fungus.",15,Southpark,33,6,,,,,,,,,
18393,Butters,8,Well I don't want burgers comin' out of my butt!,15,Southpark,48,10,,,,,,,,,
18394,Stan,8,"God, shut up! Everyone just shut the fuck up! ",15,Southpark,46,9,,,,,,,,,
18396,Stan,8,I just want everything to go back to the way it was.,15,Southpark,52,12,,,,,,,,,
18398,Stan,8,"How?... When all the things that made you laugh, just make you sick. How do you go on when nothing makes you happy? ",15,Southpark,116,23,,,,,,,,,
18402,Randy,8,"It's pretty shitty when you work so hard to be a great parent, and then the ""government"" comes along and with one shot turns your child into a ""mentally incapacitated"" freak! I mean look at him. He's disinterested, depressed, self-loathing. It's most likely the reason his mother and I got divorced!",15,Southpark,299,51,,,,,,,,,
18408,Cartman,8,Turn on your heart light. Let it shine wherever you go. Let it make a happy glow-,15,Southpark,81,17,,,,,,,,,
18410,Cartman,8,Fever... Light... lightheadedness... I don't know what's wrong with me.,15,Southpark,71,10,,,,,,,,,
18412,Cartman,8,"Oh, that's a relief. I thought maybe I had a fever but I- oh OH. Oh my buns! There's a sharp pain in my buns!",15,Southpark,109,25,,,,,,,,,
18414,Cartman,8,I-I'll try. I'll try. ,15,Southpark,22,4,,,,,,,,,
18416,Cartman,8,A what??,15,Southpark,8,2,,,,,,,,,
18418,Cartman,8,Are you serious? How can there be-  Oh my God! You're saying I have assburgers??,15,Southpark,80,15,,,,,,,,,
18420,Cartman,8,"What are you talking about?? I got vaccinated from the school, and now clearly I have Assburgers!",15,Southpark,97,17,,,,,,,,,
18422,Cartman,8,Well I'm glad you think Assburgers is funny! Just note my condition on your records there!,15,Southpark,90,16,,,,,,,,,
18425,Kyle,8,"I've tried, Wendy. I've called him, I've been to his house. But since his diagnosis, all he's done is gotten worse.",15,Southpark,115,21,,,,,,,,,
18429,Kyle,8,"I can't keep doing it, Wendy. I know he has an illness, but goddamn, it uh, it's like being around a black hole that just sucks the life out of everything.",15,Southpark,155,31,,,,,,,,,
18431,Kyle,8,"NO. I can't, Wendy.  All his negativity is starting to make me depressed. I have to let him go.  And whatever happens next, I'm going to embrace with a totally  positive attitude.",15,Southpark,179,32,,,,,,,,,
18432,Cartman,8,Godamned stupid school nurse! Heartless bitch!,15,Southpark,46,6,,,,,,,,,
18433,Kyle,8,What's the matter dude?,15,Southpark,23,4,,,,,,,,,
18434,Cartman,8,I spent all morning making hamburgers for nothing! That's what's the matter!,15,Southpark,76,12,,,,,,,,,
18435,Kyle,8,"You made hamburgers? Well that's awesome! I'd love one.  Mmm. Hm, wow  This is really good, Cartman.",15,Southpark,100,17,,,,,,,,,
18436,Cartman,8,Really?,15,Southpark,7,1,,,,,,,,,
18437,Kyle,8,Yeah.  Hey Riley! Try this hamburger.  Cartman made them himself.,15,Southpark,65,10,,,,,,,,,
18439,Kyle,8,"Seriously, Cartman. You could make money with these!",15,Southpark,52,8,,,,,,,,,
18440,Cartman,8,"Gee, thanks Kyle!",15,Southpark,17,3,,,,,,,,,
18450,Stan,8,"Wait, it's not a real illness?",15,Southpark,30,6,,,,,,,,,
18452,Stan,8,"Uh, nooo nonono, we're not doing this!",15,Southpark,38,7,,,,,,,,,

18459,Cartman,8,"There you go, Molly, and a bag of chips.",15,Southpark,40,9,,,,,,,,,
18461,Cartman,8,"How are we doing on those patties, Jew?",15,Southpark,39,8,,,,,,,,,
18462,Kyle,8,"About three minutes, fatass!",15,Southpark,28,4,,,,,,,,,

18464,Butters,8,"Jeez, we're out of finished burgers again, Eric. We need more.",15,Southpark,62,11,,,,,,,,,
18465,Cartman,8,It's alright. I think another batch is just finishing off in our top-secret flavor enhancer.,15,Southpark,92,15,,,,,,,,,
18466,Kyle,8,"Dude, come on Cartman. As employees, don't you think we should get to see what the final secret flavor enhancer is?",15,Southpark,115,21,,,,,,,,,
18467,Cartman,8,"I'm sorry Kyle, but if we compromise our final cooking process, then our patented flavor will be everywhere, and we'll have to go back to school. Now, let me get those hamburgers.  Alright, these are good to go! ",15,Southpark,212,38,,,,,,,,,
18470,Stan,8,Who are you people?,15,Southpark,19,4,,,,,,,,,

I've been resisting it, but I'm ready now. I want you to stay with Cartman Burger, dude. It's okay. You're gonna do this and I'm gonna do my thing and ...my mom and dad aren't getting back together. But you know what? It's okay. In fact, it's better. Change is gonna bring new things to all of us. Where will Cartman Burger go from here? That'll be cool to see. And it opens me up to a whole new adventure, exploring... new relationships with all new people in town.  Maybe this kid will become my new best friend.  Or maybe this kid will.",15,Southpark,696,136,,,,,,,,,

19338,Cartman,12,"What do you mean, Peter Panda?",15,Southpark,30,6,,,,,,,,,
19341,Cartman,12,Thanks Polly Prissypants. I'm just so scared that all the kids at school are gonna be talkin' about me behind my back.,15,Southpark,118,22,,,,,,,,,

19344,Butters,12,"Uh but, then, why does his face look like that? ",15,Southpark,48,10,,,,,,,,,
19345,Cartman,12,"What? What?! WHAT?! What are you guys talking about? What are you guys doin'_—”What are you talking about? I knew it! You guys are having a big 99% rally, aren't you?! Occupying the cafeteria?! You wanna know why you guys are all here protesting?! Because you're pissed off, but you actually think it's wrong to be pissed off at a black president, so you're all just pissed off at ME! Well go ahead! Have your little rally to figure out how to stick it to the 1%! See what it gets you! ",15,Southpark,486,92,,,,,,,,,

19370,Cartman,12,"I've known Clyde Frog since I was two years old. He was a fighter, a visionary. But most of all, Clyde Frog was the perfect friend. He never said anything. He never had his own ideas about what he wanted to do. He just sat there goin' along with whatever I wanted. A noble trait that seems lost on you 99%ers.  And now we live in a world where one of you has decided to become a murderer. Well whoever you are, I'm sure you're sitting there right now, in your little green hat, with your left cheek resting against your hand thinking, ""I'm not getting away with this, am I?"" Because whoever you are, maybe you still have one little piece of humanity left, covered up and tainted black by years of Jewish propaganda and left-wing lies.

19374,Cartman,12,"How do you murder a stuffed animal?! You tell us, Kyle!  Butbut but but, but uh but let's not get ahead of ourselves. There's still a biiig investigation to come. And until we prove beyond a reasonable doubt who the killer was, you are all just as guilty as Kyle. Thank you so much. Bagpipes please. ",15,Southpark,300,56,,,,,,,,,

19445,Cartman,12,"This window locks from the inside, right? And this door has a lock on it too? Don't worry Polly Prissypants, you're gonna be safe here. In this day and age, black people are just impervious to being fucked with, so we will be alright.",15,Southpark,234,44,,,,,,,,,
19447,Cartman,12,"Token, please. You're the only person I can trust. Because in today's time, black people are somehow incapable of doing something wrong.",15,Southpark,136,22,,,,,,,,,

19503,Cartman,12,"There's one problem.  You say I have to grow up, to get rid of all my dolls. You forget one crucial thing, Polly Prissypants. That nobody would possibly blame Token for all this because in today's day and age you can't blame a black person for anything.",15,Southpark,253,47,,,,,,,,,
19505,Cartman,12,Noho! I've lost every stuffed animal; I won't lose you too!,15,Southpark,59,11,,,,,,,,,

19518,Cartman,13,Does that mean we only have to pay one sixteenth attention to you? ,15,Southpark,67,13,,,,,,,,,
19520,Butters,13,Thanksgiving is about murder?,15,Southpark,29,4,,,,,,,,,
19521,Cartman,13,This is bullcrap! A guest speaker comes to our class and assigns us a report on Thanksgiving?,15,Southpark,93,17,,,,,,,,,

19536,Cartman,13,Uh-huh??,15,Southpark,8,1,,,,,,,,,
19537,Kyle,13,What? This isn't history.,15,Southpark,25,4,,,,,,,,,

19544,Kyle,13,We're not basing research for our report on this crap!,15,Southpark,54,10,,,,,,,,,
19545,Cartman,13,"Okay, let's take a vote: Who thinks the possibility of ancient aliens at Thanksgiving makes for an interesting history report? ",15,Southpark,127,20,,,,,,,,,

19553,Stan,13,...What?,15,Southpark,8,1,,,,,,,,,
19554,Cartman,13,"Yeah, God takes your period away, and apparently it makes you really irritable? I was thinking maybe that's why Kyle's been so grouchy lately, 'cause he's goin' through menopause.",15,Southpark,179,29,,,,,,,,,

19570,Butters,13,Okay Dad.,15,Southpark,9,2,,,,,,,,,
19577,Kyle,13,You might as well just say Pilgrims and Indians were all aliens who came here and made some kind of intergalactic treaty!,15,Southpark,121,22,,,,,,,,,
19578,Stan,13,"Wow, check it out dude, we're on TV. ",15,Southpark,37,8,,,,,,,,,

19665,Stan,13,"Aw, I think he's just kind of pissed off he was wrong about the whole ancient alien thing.",15,Southpark,90,18,,,,,,,,,
19667,Kyle,13,"No, ah I don't.",15,Southpark,15,4,,,,,,,,,
19669,Kyle,13,I actually only just said that sarcastically.,15,Southpark,45,7,,,,,,,,,

19773,Stan,14,Did you hear anything more about what happened?,15,Southpark,47,8,,,,,,,,,
19774,Kyle,14,"Dude, I don't think Kenny's coming back. My dad said those Child Protective Services people are pretty serious.",15,Southpark,111,18,,,,,,,,,

19791,Cartman,14,Eh yeah?,15,Southpark,8,2,,,,,,,,,
19792,Butters,14,So then I crossed that with all the kids who were on half-priced lunches with the tax records of people in town to see which kids' parents actually made the least amount of money last year.,15,Southpark,189,36,,,,,,,,,
19793,Cartman,14,"Heh heh, yeah?",15,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,
19794,Butters,14,"Well actually, Eric, it's you. ",15,Southpark,31,5,,,,,,,,,

20147,Stan,1,So what does that mean?,16,Southpark,23,5,,,,,,,,,
20149,Kyle,1,What?,16,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
20155,Randy,1,What good is the TSA if they aren't protecting us? Why have we given up freedom if a terrorist can take a hostage in a bathroom with a baby and a gun on the toilet?,16,Southpark,164,35,,,,,,,,,
20157,Randy,1,We've all stood by as our mother government has taken out dignity.,16,Southpark,66,12,,,,,,,,,
20158,Cartman,1,That's right.,16,Southpark,13,2,,,,,,,,,

20190,Cartman,1,"Hah. Yeah, well, I'm just glad that stupid TSA crap is over with. I know you've had a tough week, Clyde. But at least your mom didn't die for nothing.

20628,Kyle,4,No?,16,Southpark,3,1,,,,,,,,,
20629,Cartman,4,"Alright, Kyle, listen.  Legends tell of a horrific four legged creature from Mexico that sucks the blood of goats, and it might have just spotted in South Park.",16,Southpark,160,28,,,,,,,,,
20630,Kyle,4,What does that have to do with Passover?,16,Southpark,40,8,,,,,,,,,
20631,Cartman,4,"All I can promise you is that this is going to be the most memorable Passover ever.  ""Cartman's Passover Holiday Special"", starring, THE JEWPACABRA! ",16,Southpark,149,24,,,,,,,,,
20633,Butters,4,Hoh da lolly! This is gonna be so much fun!,16,Southpark,43,10,,,,,,,,,
20635,Kenny,4,,16,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
20636,Cartman,4,"Yeah, yeah, it should be a real blast, heh. I just hope Jewpacabra doesn't show up, that's all.",16,Southpark,95,18,,,,,,,,,
20638,Cartman,4,"Jewpaca- look, it's nothing. Forget I said anything.",16,Southpark,52,8,,,,,,,,,
20640,Cartman,4,"Okay, look: A lot of people claim that on Passover, a blood sucking creature called the Jewpacabra comes out and preys on children. This year passover happens to be the same week as Easter.",16,Southpark,189,34,,,,,,,,,
20641,Butters,4,"You mean it's like, like a monster?",16,Southpark,35,7,,,,,,,,,
20642,Cartman,4,"It's just a legend, alright?! But people all over town have started reported strange things. Knocked over trash cans, weird howls...",16,Southpark,132,21,,,,,,,,,
20644,Cartman,4,"Yeah-uh, Token! Don't think it won't come after you just because you're black!",16,Southpark,78,13,,,,,,,,,
20646,Cartman,4,"Alright, alright, stay back. Stay back! It definitely looks like a Jewpacabra attack, but it's hard to tell.",16,Southpark,108,18,,,,,,,,,
20647,Butters,4,AAAAAAHHH! ,16,Southpark,11,1,,,,,,,,,
20648,Cartman,4,"Alright guys, we're gonna need some video cameras. We gotta go out at night and try to get proof of this thing.",16,Southpark,111,22,,,,,,,,,
20649,Kyle,4,"Alright, alright! Knock it off! Stop spreading lies.",16,Southpark,52,8,,,,,,,,,
20650,Cartman,4,I'm trying to protect people. And why are you so quick to try and cover up Jewpacabra's existence?,16,Southpark,98,18,,,,,,,,,
20651,Kyle,4,I looked on the known species webpage. There's no animal called a 'Jewpacabra' mentioned anywhere.,16,Southpark,98,15,,,,,,,,,
20652,Cartman,4,"Well, neither is Bigfoot, Kyle, but there are a lot of people who say they have spotted a Sasquatch.",16,Southpark,100,19,,,,,,,,,
20653,Kyle,4,"If someone says they saw a Sasquatch, they are either lying or they are stupid. Now stop lying about a Jewpacabra before stupid people start believing you!",16,Southpark,155,27,,,,,,,,,
20654,Butters,4,"Lu lu lu, lu... N-no such thing as J-Jewpacabra. People made it up.  It's -- that's okay. Even if there was a J-Jewpacabra it couldn't get in my r-room anyways.",16,Southpark,160,30,,,,,,,,,
20655,Cartman,4,Butters.,16,Southpark,8,1,,,,,,,,,
20656,Butters,4,AAAAAHHH!,16,Southpark,9,1,,,,,,,,,
20657,Cartman,4,"Come on, Butters, you and me are gonna try to catch Jewpacabra on camera.",16,Southpark,73,14,,,,,,,,,
20658,Butters,4,"No, it's a school night!",16,Southpark,24,5,,,,,,,,,
20659,Cartman,4,"Butters, do you know how many times Jewpacabra has been shot on video? Zee-ro!  I can't do this alone, please. Help me prove to the rest of the world Jewpacabra is real.",16,Southpark,169,32,,,,,,,,,
20660,Cartman,4,"Look at these dense trees and brush. Oh yeah, this is exactly the kind of forest Jewpacabra likes to hide in.",16,Southpark,109,21,,,,,,,,,
20661,Butters,4,You think Jewpacabra is here?,16,Southpark,29,5,,,,,,,,,
20662,Cartman,4,Pretty sure Jewpacabra was here.,16,Southpark,32,5,,,,,,,,,
20663,Butters,4,Oh good. Maybe we scared it off?,16,Southpark,32,7,,,,,,,,,
20664,Cartman,4,"You can't scare a Jewpacabra, Butters. Don't forget we're dealing with a creature that drinks blood, hides in the night and has absolutely no belief in the divinity of Christ.  Did you hear that? I'm going to try a Jewpacabra mating call now. NO CHRIST! NO CHRIST! I'M REALLY NOT BUYING THIS WHOLE CHRIST THING!  He's here somewhere.",16,Southpark,333,58,,,,,,,,,
20665,Butters,4,"Oh God, I'm scared.",16,Southpark,19,4,,,,,,,,,
20666,Cartman,4,JESUS IS A LIE!,16,Southpark,15,4,,,,,,,,,
20667,Butters,4,"Eric, stop it!",16,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,
20668,Cartman,4,"Shh! Help me call it out, Butters.",16,Southpark,34,7,,,,,,,,,
20669,Butters,4,I'm not saying Jesus is a lie!,16,Southpark,30,7,,,,,,,,,
20670,Cartman,4,"Butters, do you wanna catch Jewpacabra on camera or not?!  THERE IS NO CHRIST!",16,Southpark,78,14,,,,,,,,,
20671,Butters,4,Jesus is a lie?,16,Southpark,15,4,,,,,,,,,
20672,Cartman,4,"No way Jesus was son of God, huh, Butters?",16,Southpark,42,9,,,,,,,,,
20673,Butters,4,Nope. I don't think... Christ has any basis in reality.,16,Southpark,55,10,,,,,,,,,
20674,Cartman,4,Sh! You hear that?,16,Southpark,18,4,,,,,,,,,
20675,Butters,4,"Oh, hamburgers.",16,Southpark,15,2,,,,,,,,,
20677,Cartman,4,"I didn't think you would believe me. And that why last night I took it upon myself to go out and try to capture it on video.  What I'm about to show you is the first video ever shot of a Jewpacabra.  And you're the first to see it.  This is just after 8 p.m. First we heard rustling in the bushes. Then a strange, animal-like scurrying sound. That's when we saw, this.  'Kay wait for it, wait for it, wait for it... wait for it... wait for...  right there! Did you see the Jewpacabra? I know, it's so shocking it takes a minute for your brain to process what it's seeing. Watch again.  Wait for it... wait... there!  Jewpacabra. There's a Jewpacabra in South Park. God help us.",16,Southpark,677,129,,,,,,,,,
20679,Cartman,4,"It was no dog. I was there, I'm telling you this thing had no idea that Jesus Christ had died for our sins.",16,Southpark,107,23,,,,,,,,,
20681,Cartman,4,"I can try to catch it, but I'm going to need all the resources you've got. If this thing isn't contained, your Easter Egg hunt is going to be a bloodbath. ",16,Southpark,155,31,,,,,,,,,
20687,Cartman,4,"We need to get to the city of Nassau in the Bahamas, here. ",16,Southpark,59,13,,,,,,,,,
20689,Cartman,4,That's right. There's a resort near there called 'The Atlantis Hotel and Casino'. They have a water slide there that goes through a shark tank.,16,Southpark,143,25,,,,,,,,,
20690,Cartman,4,Weeeeeee! Oh yes! Oolll! Check it out! Heheyeahehe! ,16,Southpark,52,8,,,,,,,,,
20692,Cartman,4,"Now we head back to Colorado, here.  We need to get my video of the Jewpacabra into the hands of professionals who can analyze it.",16,Southpark,130,25,,,,,,,,,
20693,Kyle,4,Would you stop scaring everyone with your dumb ass myth!,16,Southpark,56,10,,,,,,,,,
20694,Cartman,4,"People thought Atlantis was a myth, Kyle, but I was just there. I've explored the depths of Atlantis, and now I'm about to prove a new species exists. I'm a little James Cameron.",16,Southpark,178,33,,,,,,,,,
20695,Kyle,4,"These people aren't going to prove anything. To believe any of this you either have to be a liar, or stupid.",16,Southpark,108,21,,,,,,,,,
20696,Cartman,4,"These are professional people who go around tracking Sasquatches, Kyle! They aren't liars, and they aren't stupid!",16,Southpark,114,17,,,,,,,,,
20704,Cartman,4,I've already done my research boys. What you're looking at there is a Jewpacabra.,16,Southpark,81,14,,,,,,,,,
20706,Cartman,4,"It's like a Sasquatch, only more elusive, more ferocious and a little more greedy.",16,Southpark,82,14,,,,,,,,,
20709,Cartman,4,"Well, I guess that's it. You're going to have to only allow me into the Easter Egg hunt, sir. I'm the only one qualified.",16,Southpark,121,24,,,,,,,,,
20713,Cartman,4,Heh. What do you mean? ,16,Southpark,23,5,,,,,,,,,
20715,Cartman,4,"Well, I mean it could have just been a dog?",16,Southpark,43,10,,,,,,,,,
20719,Cartman,4,"Well, come on guys, it's probably a Jewpacabra but this isn't definitive.",16,Southpark,73,12,,,,,,,,,
20721,Cartman,4,Why?,16,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
20724,Cartman,4,"There's... no way. No way Jewpacabra is real.  Those, those cryptozoologists don't know what they're talking about. They just... they just gave me a case of the Hebrew jeebies that's all... Eh, eaah.  Hey. Jewpacabra can't be real, right? Tell me again why it can't be real?  I mean, it's impossible that something I made up could turn out to actually exist, huh, Kyle?",16,Southpark,369,64,,,,,,,,,
20725,Kyle,4,What are you doing?,16,Southpark,19,4,,,,,,,,,
20726,Cartman,4,"Okay, okay. Even if there was a Jewpacabra, it wouldn't know I was the one who got video of it, huh? How could it know that? It couldn't know that, right? Kyle? ",16,Southpark,161,32,,,,,,,,,
20727,Cartman,4,Jesus loves me this I know'Cause Republicans tell me soLittle ones God will protect'Cause letting kids be harmed is child neglectEverything still clear out there?,16,Southpark,162,25,,,,,,,,,
20728,Cartman,4,Guys?!,16,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
20729,Butters,4,"It's all quiet out front, Eric.",16,Southpark,31,6,,,,,,,,,
20730,Cartman,4,"Well, check everywhere! I'm not paying you guys each twenty bucks to scratch your buttholes!",16,Southpark,92,15,,,,,,,,,
20731,Butters,4,He says he's not payin' us to scratch our buttholes. ,16,Southpark,53,10,,,,,,,,,
20732,Cartman,4,What? What was that? Butters? Token?!  Oh Jesus Christ! You guys?! Aghgh!  You guys?! GUYS!,16,Southpark,91,15,,,,,,,,,
20733,Butters,4,"Hey, Eric.",16,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,
20734,Cartman,4,It's trying to get in! Where the hell are you guys?,16,Southpark,51,11,,,,,,,,,
20735,Butters,4,"Well, we got scared so we're next door at Wingstreet. ",16,Southpark,54,10,,,,,,,,,
20736,Cartman,4,Wingstreet?!,16,Southpark,12,1,,,,,,,,,
20737,Butters,4,"Yeah, well it was the closest place to hide.",16,Southpark,44,9,,,,,,,,,
20738,Cartman,4,"Dude, I want wings!  Ahghgh!!!  Oh Jesus, it's only you!",16,Southpark,56,10,,,,,,,,,
20740,Cartman,4,HUH?!,16,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
20742,Cartman,4,Get me outta here! PLEASE! HEELP!,16,Southpark,33,6,,,,,,,,,
20744,Cartman,4,"OH GOD, IT'S GONNA KILL ME!  What the-?",16,Southpark,39,8,,,,,,,,,
20746,Cartman,4,This isn't safe or fun!,16,Southpark,23,5,,,,,,,,,
20748,Cartman,4,"NO! COME BACK! Come back please, this isn't right!",16,Southpark,50,9,,,,,,,,,
20750,Cartman,4,"Kyle! Hey, Kyle!  I know what you're thinking, Kyle. That, like, this is some kind of fitting comeuppance.",16,Southpark,106,18,,,,,,,,,
20751,Kyle,4,"Admit you're lying, and I'll let you go.",16,Southpark,40,8,,,,,,,,,
20752,Cartman,4,"Oh, of course I was lying, Kyle. There's no Jewpacabra. Now, please, Kyle, it's Easter Eve! And if Jewpacabra smells this blood, I am in a heap of trouble!  No Kyle! No, wait! I'm sorry I couldn't help it! Kyle?! Please I'll give you money! I have lots of money!  Oh God, what am I doing?  I mean, I mean, I don't have any money! I'm totally broke!  Oh God, I am in a heap of trouble.",16,Southpark,384,77,,,,,,,,,
20753,Cartman,4,It's so cool that even though I'm Christian I celebrate Passover too! Yup. I think both holidays are awesome.  I really sympathize with those Jews in Ancient Egypt! I really do! ,16,Southpark,178,31,,,,,,,,,
20758,Cartman,4,"Bobo?! Bobo, no!  Wha- ",16,Southpark,23,4,,,,,,,,,
20766,Cartman,4,Ugh... what... where...,16,Southpark,23,3,,,,,,,,,
20767,Cartman,4,Ugh... what?  What's going on?,16,Southpark,30,5,,,,,,,,,
20769,Cartman,4,"It's raining frogggggsss!  Kyle! Kyle, my Hebrew friend! Did you see that it's raining frogs?",16,Southpark,93,15,,,,,,,,,
20770,Kyle,4,Yes. It's because the Pharaoh won't give the Hebrews what we want! God is angry.,16,Southpark,80,15,,,,,,,,,
20771,Cartman,4,"So God makes it rain frogs? That just seems kind of mean to frogs, Kyle.",16,Southpark,72,15,,,,,,,,,
20772,Kyle,4,"That's how God is! And if Pharaoh doesn't give us what we want, next he's gonna kill all Egyptian first born boys!",16,Southpark,114,22,,,,,,,,,
20773,Cartman,4,"Wha- Okay, look, I'll talk to the Pharaoh and see if he'll change his mind.",16,Southpark,75,15,,,,,,,,,
20774,Kyle,4,It doesn't matter. Because God is going to harden the Pharaoh's heart!,16,Southpark,70,12,,,,,,,,,
20775,Cartman,4,What does that mean?,16,Southpark,20,4,,,,,,,,,
20776,Kyle,4,It means Jehovah is going to use his powers to keep the Pharaoh from letting us go.,16,Southpark,83,17,,,,,,,,,
20777,Cartman,4,"Well that doesn't seem very fair, Kyle. I mean, if God is going to make Pharaoh say no, then why would he punish him for saying no?",16,Southpark,131,27,,,,,,,,,
20778,Kyle,4,That's just how God is.,16,Southpark,23,5,,,,,,,,,
20779,Cartman,4,"You're wrong, Kyle! God is not a dick! ",16,Southpark,39,8,,,,,,,,,
20780,Cartman,4,"Daaad, when's it gonna stop raining frogs?",16,Southpark,42,7,,,,,,,,,
20782,Cartman,4,"But my friend Kyle, he says that the reason we've had all these plagues and stuff because you won't let all the Jews leave.",16,Southpark,123,24,,,,,,,,,
20784,Cartman,4,"Wow, that makes sense. Don't think anyone can deny that. ",16,Southpark,57,10,,,,,,,,,
20786,Cartman,4,"But dad, my friend Kyle says that if we don't do whatever the Hebrews want us to do, God is gonna kill little Egyptian boys.",16,Southpark,124,25,,,,,,,,,
20788,Cartman,4,"I love you, dad.",16,Southpark,16,4,,,,,,,,,
20790,Cartman,4,And our love grows,16,Southpark,18,4,,,,,,,,,
20792,Cartman,4,"Have no fear, for God is nearAnd God loves all his childrenHuh?  Nooooooo!  Kyle, why? What are you doing?",16,Southpark,106,19,,,,,,,,,
20793,Kyle,4,This is what God told us to do!,16,Southpark,31,8,,,,,,,,,
20794,Cartman,4,"No, Kyle! I don't believe you!",16,Southpark,30,6,,,,,,,,,
20795,Kyle,4,You'll see! ,16,Southpark,12,2,,,,,,,,,
20796,Cartman,4,Noooo! ,16,Southpark,7,1,,,,,,,,,
20798,Cartman,4,Noooooo! ,16,Southpark,9,1,,,,,,,,,
20800,Cartman,4,Noooo! ,16,Southpark,7,1,,,,,,,,,
20802,Cartman,4,No! The bread's all flat! No!  Aaaaahhhh! ,16,Southpark,42,7,,,,,,,,,
20804,Cartman,4,We were wrong! I'm sorry God I'll be Jewish I promise! Please don't kill me! Don't kill me! Doooo...! ,16,Southpark,102,19,,,,,,,,,
20805,Cartman,4,No! No! The bread is all flat! No!,16,Southpark,34,8,,,,,,,,,
20807,Cartman,4,"I'm alive!  I'm alive, you guys.  I don't know how, but I'm alive!  Can you believe it? It's a miracle.  Listen everybody, last night I almost died. But then a Passover miracle happened. The Jewpacabra passed me over, and by the power of Jehovah I somehow woke up safely in my bed. I learnt a big lesson. It's wrong, guys. Christ didn't die for our sins and God is angry. It's time for us all to stop this Easter ridiculousness, accept Jehovah as our God and deny Christ.",16,Southpark,471,88,,,,,,,,,
20808,Butters,4,"Oh, stop trying to ruin Easter, you! You heathen! ",16,Southpark,50,9,,,,,,,,,
20809,Cartman,4,"Hey guys, listen!  I finally know how you feel, Kyle. Know your religion is right but being laughed at by everyone else. It's so hard for us Jews. But I guess we just have to let stupid people believe what they are gonna believe.",16,Southpark,229,44,,,,,,,,,
20810,Kyle,4,Yeah.,16,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
20811,Cartman,4,I-I know what you're thinking Kyle. But I really do believe in Judaism now. I'm not lying.,16,Southpark,90,17,,,,,,,,,
20812,Kyle,4,"I know, you're not.",16,Southpark,19,4,,,,,,,,,
20813,Cartman,4,"Kewl, thanks Kyle. Oh, and Kyle... Happy Passover!",16,Southpark,50,8,,,,,,,,,
20814,Kyle,4,"Happy Passover, Cartman. ",16,Southpark,25,3,,,,,,,,,
20815,Cartman,5,"Nonono, I'm tellin' you guys, music videos have devolved to nothing but pretty girls wearing skin-tight clothes, and singin' songs about their vajayjays. Used to be chicks sang about their relationships; now it's all ""my vajayjay this, my vajayjay that."" But clearly that's what sells. Think about it. When was the last time you turned on a music video and didn't see some chick strumming a guitar singing about her vajayjay?  See? You can't remember.",16,Southpark,451,75,,,,,,,,,
20816,Butters,5,"Heh, h-hey fellas. ",16,Southpark,19,3,,,,,,,,,
20817,Kyle,5,"Where's your lunch, Butters?",16,Southpark,28,4,,,,,,,,,
20818,Butters,5,"OH.  Uh, it's okay. Um I'm not hungry anyways.",16,Southpark,46,9,,,,,,,,,

20823,Stan,5,Well then write the principal an anonymous letter.,16,Southpark,50,8,,,,,,,,,
20824,Butters,5,"Naw, I'm not no Anonymous Andy.",16,Southpark,31,6,,,,,,,,,
20826,Butters,5,"Naw, I don't want kids calling me a Clich’© Conflict Resolution Kevin.",16,Southpark,70,12,,,,,,,,,
20827,Cartman,5,He has a point.,16,Southpark,15,4,,,,,,,,,
20828,Kyle,5,"Well, then you gotta ride it out, Butters.",16,Southpark,42,8,,,,,,,,,
20830,Stan,5,I can't believe what I'm hearing!  This is why bullying is getting worse and worse at out schools! We can't all sit by and let it happen anymore!,16,Southpark,145,28,,,,,,,,,
20832,Cartman,5,I have balls.,16,Southpark,13,3,,,,,,,,,
20834,Cartman,5,Still balls.,16,Southpark,12,2,,,,,,,,,
20835,Kyle,5,"Look Butters, why don't you just talk to your family about it? You said your Grandma's visiting this week. Why don't you try talking to her?",16,Southpark,140,26,,,,,,,,,
20836,Butters,5,My Grandma?,16,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,

20842,Butters,5,Could I maybe talk to Grammy alone?,16,Southpark,35,7,,,,,,,,,
20845,Butters,5,"I just...  don't want you to pick on me no more, Grandma.",16,Southpark,57,12,,,,,,,,,
20847,Butters,5,"Um, I don't think I'm tough... grandma.",16,Southpark,39,7,,,,,,,,,
20849,Butters,5,"No, you took it all!",16,Southpark,20,5,,,,,,,,,
20870,Butters,5,My grandma??,16,Southpark,12,2,,,,,,,,,
20872,Butters,5,Oh hamburgers! ,16,Southpark,15,2,,,,,,,,,

20896,Stan,5,I'll do it! I'll be in charge.,16,Southpark,30,7,,,,,,,,,
20898,Stan,5,"No, I just... I think bullying has gotten out of hand. And it needs to be stopped.",16,Southpark,82,17,,,,,,,,,
20903,Stan,5,"Hey guys, guys! Don't pick on Butters! That's not cool. You can't do that. Bullying? Did you know that in America, hohoh,  over 200,000 students every day are afraid to come to school because of bullying?  At South Park Elementary we're better than that. Come on. Let's all put an end to bullying. Right now! Five Six Seven Eight!",16,Southpark,330,59,,,,,,,,,

20907,Cartman,5,My heart says ye-es  but my vajayjay says no-o,16,Southpark,46,9,,,,,,,,,
20908,Butters,5,Trapped inside the darkness of my mind.I try to break free. The words are so unkind.,16,Southpark,84,16,,,,,,,,,
20911,Kyle,5,Pansy.,16,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
20913,Butters,5,"Can I, can I not do this, please?  I don't wanna do this.",16,Southpark,57,13,,,,,,,,,
20914,Stan,5,"Aw Butters, you ruined it. This is all one big long shot and you ruined it.",16,Southpark,75,16,,,,,,,,,

20975,Stan,5,"What's up, Kyle? Why are you trying to trash-talk our theatrical release?",16,Southpark,73,12,,,,,,,,,
20976,Kyle,5,Do you really think that this is good for Butters? To have his face put up all over signs as the poster child for bullying?,16,Southpark,123,25,,,,,,,,,
20977,Stan,5,"Butters is totally fine with it, dude.",16,Southpark,38,7,,,,,,,,,

20985,Stan,5,"...What, what was the question again?",16,Southpark,37,6,,,,,,,,,
20986,Kyle,5,"If you really think every kid in America should see your anti-bullying movie, then why don't you put it on the Internet for free?!",16,Southpark,130,24,,,,,,,,,
20987,Stan,5,"...Get, get out of here, Kyle! I'm trying to go to the bathroom!",16,Southpark,64,13,,,,,,,,,
20988,Kyle,5,"Fine! But when you're naked and jackin' it in San Diego, don't ask me for help! ",16,Southpark,80,16,,,,,,,,,
20989,Stan,5,Why does he keep saying that?,16,Southpark,29,6,,,,,,,,,
20991,Stan,5,"Well, I just got tired of seeing people like Butters getting pushed around, and I knew I had to do somethin' about it. ",16,Southpark,119,23,,,,,,,,,
20993,Butters,5,"Oh uh, nothin'.",16,Southpark,15,3,,,,,,,,,

21006,Stan,5,I didn't beat up Dr. Oz! Don't be mad at me!,16,Southpark,44,11,,,,,,,,,
21011,Butters,5,"Grandma? I did it, Grandma.  I finally stood up for myself. I got real mean and I beat the shnozz our of Dr. Oz.  I can't lie, it felt kind of good.  At first. But since then all I have is just... a kind of dark, empty feeling. Then I realized... that's how you must feel. All the time.  Poor old Grandma. You know, I've I've been gettin' lots of advice how to deal with you. Stand up to you, tell on you... But I kind of realize there's just people like you out there. All over the place. When you're a kid, things seem like they're gonna last forever. But they're not. Life changes. Why you won't always be around. Someday you're gonna die.  Someday pretty soon.  And when you're layin' in that hospital bed, with tubes up your nose, and that little pan under your butt to pee in, well I'll come visit ya. I'll come just to show you that, that I'm still alive and I'm still happy. And you'll die. Bein' nothin' but you.  'Night Grandma. ",16,Southpark,939,180,,,,,,,,,

21014,Stan,5,Wha? What's the movie studio saying about it?,16,Southpark,45,8,,,,,,,,,
21015,Cartman,5,The studio backed out! The producer had a change of heart! BOOOOO!,16,Southpark,66,12,,,,,,,,,
21018,Stan,5,How was I supposed to know Butters was actually a violent psychopath?,16,Southpark,69,12,,,,,,,,,
21020,Stan,5,Everyone loved me sixteen hours ago.,16,Southpark,36,6,,,,,,,,,

21042,Kyle,6,We could go to the city pool. They have a water slide,16,Southpark,53,12,,,,,,,,,
21043,Cartman,6,"Noo nono, I'm not getting in a pool with Kenny. He has herpes.",16,Southpark,62,13,,,,,,,,,

21050,Cartman,6,"Hey yeah, ziplining! That could be really cool!",16,Southpark,47,8,,,,,,,,,
21051,Kyle,6,We've definitely not done that before!,16,Southpark,38,6,,,,,,,,,

21053,Kyle,6,Cool! Ziplining.,16,Southpark,16,2,,,,,,,,,
21054,Cartman,6,Ziplining. Hell yeah.,16,Southpark,21,3,,,,,,,,,

21062,Stan,6,Yeah.,16,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
21064,Kyle,6,"And so they put us in these harnesses and helmets. I th-I think that's when we started realizing, ""Oh wow, this is actually pretty dangerous.""",16,Southpark,142,25,,,,,,,,,
21066,Cartman,6,Alright!,16,Southpark,8,1,,,,,,,,,

21074,Stan,6,Good. How are you?,16,Southpark,18,4,,,,,,,,,

21079,Kyle,6,We don't mind.,16,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,

21299,Mr. Garrison,7,"And so what we start to see now is a pattern in world history much like the Greeks and the Romans. Remember that there were seven families fighting for control of the land of Westeroth. The king of Westeroth was who? Robert Baratheon , and he asked Eddard, also known as, of course, Lord Stark, to serve as hand of the king. You remember that Lord Stark accepted, or course. The queen's family - that's the Lannisters - were really trying back then to take control, weren't they? But where were the Targaryens at this time? Well, they were across the sea. We all talked about how they were also trying to take the throne. So we've got the Greeks, the Romans, the Starks, Lannisters, Baratheons, Targaryens, all headed for a big blowout right in Season 2. Now, what I really wanted to get into today is what was going on in the north, because that's just a whole other mess- ",16,Southpark,874,161,,,,,,,,,

21306,Mr. Garrison,7,"Token, is there a problem? ",16,Southpark,27,5,,,,,,,,,
21307,Cartman,7,"Ah he's just a little sick, Mr. Garrison. He's got boneritis.  Right guys? ",16,Southpark,75,13,,,,,,,,,
21308,Mr. Garrison,7,"Everyone pay attention!  Now, what I really wanna get into today is what was going on in the north, because that's just a whole other mess that's pretty hard to keep straight, isn't it? The Night's Watch- ",16,Southpark,205,37,,,,,,,,,
21309,Cartman,7,"Token.  Dude, dude. Dude.",16,Southpark,25,4,,,,,,,,,

21344,Cartman,7,"Just, the grapevine. Um, there's something you should probably know.  Oh man this is hard. Um, the thing is, me and Kyle are kind of, you know, ...together?",16,Southpark,156,28,,,,,,,,,
21346,Cartman,7,"Yeah, he's my man. I'm more out than Kyle is, but... it's tough, because he acts like we're not a couple at school because he's embarrassed, but... we get home and he's the best boyfriend I've ever had.",16,Southpark,202,38,,,,,,,,,
21348,Cartman,7,"Cool, just, you know, don't touch me 'cause I'm not into girls, so it kind of grosses me out.",16,Southpark,93,19,,,,,,,,,

21356,Butters,7,"Are you sure, Eric? I mean, maybe they just aren't meant for each other.",16,Southpark,72,14,,,,,,,,,

Well you give better hugs than anyone out on that field!",16,Southpark,303,53,,,,,,,,,
21594,Cartman,8,That's true.,16,Southpark,12,2,,,,,,,,,
21595,Butters,8,"Are we just gonna let North Park walk away with a victory because we think they know how to be nicer than us?  Bein' nice is about what's inside you! When your enemy is nice to you, you just be nice right back! And if they give you two balloons, well you give them three!",16,Southpark,271,55,,,,,,,,,
21597,Butters,8,"And when they try an-and thank you for those balloons, you say ""Ah I don't need any thanks! I did it 'cause it was the right thing to do!"" And then you give them a smile!",16,Southpark,170,36,,,,,,,,,
21599,Butters,8,"And when that other team tries to cover you, well that's when you gotta reach deep down. Right down to your creamy center. Well that place, well that place inside of you where, where all the goouey happy-lovin' goo sits and you just gotta use that and be the nicest, most compassionate player you've ever been, and let the world know that we will not fall down so easy!",16,Southpark,369,69,,,,,,,,,
21601,Cartman,8,"Let's do this.  Stan, hook up my bra.",16,Southpark,37,8,,,,,,,,,
21603,Randy,8,"Oh thank you, commissioner! I'm thrilled to be a part of this! Thanks!",16,Southpark,70,13,,,,,,,,,
21605,Randy,8,"Yeah, no, you nice going! ",16,Southpark,26,5,,,,,,,,,

21609,Randy,8,"Oh yeah, good one! ",16,Southpark,19,4,,,,,,,,,
21618,Kyle,8,"Dude, what do you mean ""We don't have a coach.""?",16,Southpark,48,10,,,,,,,,,
21619,Stan,8,"Look, I'm sorry guys, my dad said he's too busy with the Broncos. He doesn't have time for us.",16,Southpark,94,19,,,,,,,,,
21620,Kyle,8,But our big game with Lakewood is Saturday!,16,Southpark,43,8,,,,,,,,,
21621,Stan,8,I'm sorry. My dad is taking professional sarcastaball really seriously.,16,Southpark,71,10,,,,,,,,,
21623,Kyle,8,We can't.,16,Southpark,9,2,,,,,,,,,
21625,Cartman,8,Who needs a coach? We have Butters.,16,Southpark,35,7,,,,,,,,,
21626,Butters,8,Huh?,16,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
21628,Stan,8,"The guys are right. From now on, you're team captain, Butters. You lead us to victory.",16,Southpark,86,16,,,,,,,,,
21629,Butters,8,"Oh jeez n-no, I I don't know, fellas.",16,Southpark,37,8,,,,,,,,,
21630,Cartman,8,"Butters, you understand this game better than anybody.",16,Southpark,54,8,,,,,,,,,
21631,Butters,8,"Yeah, but I uh, I I can't be team captain. I... Well I suck at everything.",16,Southpark,74,16,,,,,,,,,
21632,Stan,8,Not at this you don't! What about that creamy filling you talked about? That gooey goodness inside you that makes you the butteriest Butters we know?,16,Southpark,149,26,,,,,,,,,
21633,Butters,8,'At's in there. It's overflowing sometimes. ,16,Southpark,44,6,,,,,,,,,
21634,Kyle,8,"We need you, Butters. You're the man! ",16,Southpark,38,7,,,,,,,,,
21638,Butters,8,"I love you too, ladies. ",16,Southpark,24,5,,,,,,,,,
21641,Butters,8,Woohoohoohoohoo!,16,Southpark,16,1,,,,,,,,,
21642,Butters,8,Wuh wuuuhhh wuh!  Wha? Wha? Oh.  Ohhh... Daaad! It happened again.  More of my creamy goo came out. ,16,Southpark,100,18,,,,,,,,,

21646,Butters,8,"Okay Dad!  Oh! Saaave that, for later. ",16,Southpark,39,7,,,,,,,,,
21650,Randy,8,"Oh yeah, nice going, replacement refs!",16,Southpark,38,6,,,,,,,,,
21653,Randy,8,YEAH!  YEAH! WOO!,16,Southpark,17,3,,,,,,,,,
21655,Randy,8,"Yeah, well, the other team was just so awesome on offense I was really scared. ",16,Southpark,79,15,,,,,,,,,
21657,Randy,8,"Oh yeah, I'm just the guy who invented sarcastaball! There's no way I'd know how to coach it!",16,Southpark,93,18,,,,,,,,,
21659,Randy,8,...Yeah... ,16,Southpark,11,1,,,,,,,,,
21660,Randy,8,"All right guys, listen up! Forget about the day off, we need to practice tomorrow.",16,Southpark,82,15,,,,,,,,,
21663,Randy,8,"That's good, Peyton, but we need to get better.",16,Southpark,47,9,,,,,,,,,
21665,Randy,8,That's IT! ,16,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
21666,Cartman,8,"Hey Butters, you got a minute?",16,Southpark,30,6,,,,,,,,,
21667,Butters,8,"Wuh sure, Eric. ",16,Southpark,16,3,,,,,,,,,
21668,Cartman,8,"I don't now what to do. Kids are starting to make fun of me because, I'm no good at sarcastaball. I suck at being nice and polite. I'm so good at sucking I should work at a Thai massage parlor.",16,Southpark,193,40,,,,,,,,,
21669,Butters,8,"Uh-uh oh, no E-eric, you're, why you're a great player.",16,Southpark,55,10,,,,,,,,,
21670,Cartman,8,"No, I just don't have the mojo you have, Butters.",16,Southpark,49,10,,,,,,,,,
21671,Butters,8,"Oh, well, ye-Eric, ah I told you: everyone has a creamy filling inside them, where all the feelings of compassion and joy come from. Oh, didn't your dad ever tell you that?",16,Southpark,172,32,,,,,,,,,
21672,Cartman,8,...I don't have a dad.,16,Southpark,22,5,,,,,,,,,
21673,Butters,8,"...Oh right, I, I'm sorry. Well, everyone has a creamy filling, Eric. And and some people have so much of that filling that it, that it comes out sometimes. A lot of times, when I go to sleep, and especially if I've had them wonderful dreams that make me feel really good, sometimes I wake up, and when I wake up, I I realize some of my goo has come out.  But I always make sure I keep it, just in case I ever run out of all my sunshine happy feelings.",16,Southpark,452,92,,,,,,,,,
21674,Cartman,8,Youuu save it all?,16,Southpark,18,4,,,,,,,,,
21675,Butters,8,"My goo doesn't come out every night, but I sure do seem to have a surplus of it. ",16,Southpark,81,18,,,,,,,,,
21676,Cartman,8,"Butters, do you think your goo might work on someone else?",16,Southpark,58,11,,,,,,,,,
21677,Butters,8,I don't know. Weh I never really thought of it that way. ,16,Southpark,57,12,,,,,,,,,
21678,Cartman,8,"Hm, it's kind of a grapey, bleachy flavor.",16,Southpark,42,8,,,,,,,,,
21679,Butters,8,Do you feel warm and compassionate?,16,Southpark,35,6,,,,,,,,,
21680,Cartman,8,Holy shit I think I do.,16,Southpark,23,6,,,,,,,,,
21682,Randy,8,"Yeah, it's awesome to be on your show.",16,Southpark,38,8,,,,,,,,,
21684,Randy,8,"Thanks, Jim. 'Cause it's totally what I intended. You know, when I came up with the idea I was sure it was gonna end up like this.",16,Southpark,130,27,,,,,,,,,
21686,Randy,8,Thanks Jim. ,16,Southpark,12,2,,,,,,,,,
21688,Randy,8,"Oh yeah, I've totally got time to do that, Sharon! In fact, how about I go downstairs and make a four-course meal for all of you? Check that: a seven-course meal?",16,Southpark,162,31,,,,,,,,,
21690,Randy,8,"Oh, right! I can't stop being sarcastic now!",16,Southpark,44,8,,,,,,,,,
21692,Randy,8,"Right, it's doing something to my brain! And now I can't stop being sarcastic!",16,Southpark,78,14,,,,,,,,,
21694,Randy,8,"Yes! I totally mean it!  Help me, Sharon. Help me.",16,Southpark,50,10,,,,,,,,,
21695,Butters,8,"All right, first string, cover those wideouts. Tell 'em how much you like their outfits! Clyde, Token! Hug those two players and give their quarterback a kiss. ",16,Southpark,160,27,,,,,,,,,
21697,Stan,8,"Cartman, you idiot!",16,Southpark,19,3,,,,,,,,,
21698,Butters,8,"Stay positive, Stan! All right guys, cuddle up, cuddle up!  Now what is goin' on out there?",16,Southpark,91,17,,,,,,,,,
21699,Cartman,8,That kid is provoking us! He's saying mean things to try and piss us off.,16,Southpark,73,15,,,,,,,,,
21701,Butters,8,"Oh, all right. Well all right, here you go. ",16,Southpark,44,9,,,,,,,,,
21703,Randy,8,"Oh boy, this is great! My week just keeps getting better.",16,Southpark,57,11,,,,,,,,,
21706,Randy,8,So that's it.  I should just go home and forget about what this sport has done to me. Let thousands of people play sarcastaball and get hurt too! ,16,Southpark,146,28,,,,,,,,,
21708,Randy,8,"No, sarcastaball has nothing to do with it. I just... I just really enjoy being sarcastic and so I must be finding an excuse.",16,Southpark,125,24,,,,,,,,,
21710,Randy,8,My son is out there playing that game! It's heartwarming to see you have such high regard for his safety!,16,Southpark,105,20,,,,,,,,,
21712,Randy,8,"Thank you, doctor. Thank you so much! ",16,Southpark,38,7,,,,,,,,,
21715,Butters,8,Like me!,16,Southpark,8,2,,,,,,,,,
21720,Butters,8,"42! Red 13! Sunshine and happy thoughts! Sunshine and happy thoouughts! HUT!  Oh no, that kid's gonna intercept it!  Good job, kid! ",16,Southpark,132,22,,,,,,,,,
21721,Randy,8,STAN?! Stan! ,16,Southpark,13,2,,,,,,,,,
21722,Stan,8,Dad?,16,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
21723,Randy,8,"Get in the car, Stan! We're going home!",16,Southpark,39,8,,,,,,,,,
21724,Stan,8,What?,16,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
21727,Randy,8,"Everyone! Everyone, listen! There's something you all need to know about sarcastaball. It turns out... it's totally safe.  Yeah, it's super safe! It's like sooo safe that we should have every kid play it-ugh!  Oh! Sorry, sorry. Hang on. Gotta not be so sarcastic. Ahem, let me try that again. Listen everyone... if you let your kids play sarcastaball, you're a fucking genius! Ogh!.. Gyugh! Cut, sorry. Let me try this again.  Look, what I'm trying to say is, we should have like, 10 sarcastaball leagues, because then everyone-! Would-  God damn it!",16,Southpark,550,93,,,,,,,,,
21729,Stan,8,"Whoawhoa, you can't, you can't tell me what to do!",16,Southpark,50,10,,,,,,,,,
21730,Randy,8,"Yeah, we're your parents! We can't tell you what to do!",16,Southpark,55,11,,,,,,,,,
21732,Stan,8,"Oh right, like he doesn't exaggerate every disease he gets!",16,Southpark,59,10,,,,,,,,,
21734,Butters,8,"Mr. Marsh, listen. I know you care about your son, but he's a heck of a player! He's good at tickling, laughing, and getting along.",16,Southpark,131,25,,,,,,,,,
21735,Randy,8,"Look, the point has been made, okay?! I'm warning you, being this sarcastic is dangerous!",16,Southpark,89,15,,,,,,,,,
21736,Stan,8,"We're not being sarcastic, Dad! Is it so hard to believe that we really enjoy a sport that has no violence? Is it so hard for you to believe that when Butters says ""Competitiveness can be compassionate,"" he's being completely sincere?",16,Southpark,234,41,,,,,,,,,
21737,Randy,8,I don't see how anyone could play this game with any sincerity.,16,Southpark,63,12,,,,,,,,,
21738,Cartman,8,That's because you're too grumpy and negative to believe it. What you need... is a sports drink that can boost your levels of caring and goodness.,16,Southpark,146,26,,,,,,,,,
21739,Stan,8,Yeah Dad. You need some of this. ,16,Southpark,33,7,,,,,,,,,
21740,Randy,8,... This is cum. ,16,Southpark,17,4,,,,,,,,,
21742,Butters,8,What's sarcasm and what's com?,16,Southpark,30,5,,,,,,,,,
21744,Randy,8,Come on everybody. Let's work on that kickoff change and get back to some football. ,16,Southpark,84,15,,,,,,,,,
21746,Butters,8,DAD! Hey Dad!,16,Southpark,13,3,,,,,,,,,
21748,Butters,8,My wiener is all stiff and pointy!,16,Southpark,34,7,,,,,,,,,
21750,Butters,8,"Thanks, Dad.",16,Southpark,12,2,,,,,,,,,
21751,Stan,9,"You find a good catcher's mitt, Cartman?",16,Southpark,40,7,,,,,,,,,
21752,Cartman,9,"Dude, how come when we play baseball I have to be the catcher? ",16,Southpark,63,13,,,,,,,,,
21753,Kyle,9,"Well, because you got good coordination, sharp reflexes, and you're fucking fat.",16,Southpark,80,12,,,,,,,,,
21754,Cartman,9,"I'm not fat, Kyle.",16,Southpark,18,4,,,,,,,,,
21755,Kyle,9,"Right, you're not fat.",16,Southpark,22,4,,,,,,,,,
21756,Cartman,9,"Dude, I'm not fat! I don't drive around on a mobility scooter like  bitch! ",16,Southpark,75,14,,,,,,,,,
21757,Stan,9,Whoa duude!,16,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
21758,Kyle,9,"Jesus Christ, you can't even walk down an aisle to get your candy? ",16,Southpark,67,13,,,,,,,,,
21760,Cartman,9,See what I mean? You can't even walk around a Wall-Mart anymore without getting run over by some fat dick on a Rascal.,16,Southpark,118,23,,,,,,,,,
21761,Kyle,9,Why do they even allow those things in stored?,16,Southpark,46,9,,,,,,,,,
21762,Stan,9,"They don't just allow them, they have them available at the front. ",16,Southpark,67,12,,,,,,,,,
21763,Kyle,9,You've gotta be kidding me!,16,Southpark,27,5,,,,,,,,,
21764,Cartman,9,"Oh my God you guys, look at this!  Candy Corn Oreos. Oreos with candy corn filling.  Holy hell yes!",16,Southpark,99,19,,,,,,,,,
21765,Kyle,9,"Are you serious?? Look around: doesn't this bother you at all??  That's YOU one day, fatass! Not even one day! If you don't change something, that's you! In about a year! ",16,Southpark,171,31,,,,,,,,,
21767,Cartman,9,"Yeah... Yeah, here you go. ",16,Southpark,27,5,,,,,,,,,
21768,Cartman,9,"Hey Kyle, can I come in for a second?",16,Southpark,37,9,,,,,,,,,
21769,Kyle,9,Why? ,16,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
21770,Cartman,9,"I've been... doing a lot of thinking... about what you said at Wall-Mart.  You're right Kyle. I'm fat.  All these years you tell me and me saying ""No, I'm big-boned"" or ""no, that's just muscle""... It was always just me living in denial. I'm fucking fat, Kyle. I'm fucking fat as fucking fuck.",16,Southpark,292,53,,,,,,,,,
21771,Kyle,9,"Cartman, uh, all I was trying to tell you at Wall-Mart was that you-",16,Southpark,68,14,,,,,,,,,
21772,Cartman,9,"No! It's okay, Kyle... because... I'm not gonna live like some... slug who can't even leave his house 'cause he can't get around. Now that I can admit I'm fat, I decided to finally do something about it.  Sweeeeeeeeeet!",16,Southpark,219,39,,,,,,,,,
21773,Kyle,9,Oh no!,16,Southpark,6,2,,,,,,,,,
21774,Cartman,9,"Don't know what took me so long, dude. All I needed was a few extra pounds and the insurance company paid for my own private one! See? It's got a basket in front for my candy corn Oreos. ",16,Southpark,187,38,,,,,,,,,
21775,Kyle,9,You don't need that! Get off of it.,16,Southpark,35,8,,,,,,,,,
21776,Cartman,9,"Dude, it's sweet. Did you know they make access for mobility scooters everywhere? I can seriously go from my bed to Wall-Mart and never have to touch the floor, once. ",16,Southpark,167,30,,,,,,,,,
21777,Kyle,9,"That's not what I meant by doing something about it, Cartman!",16,Southpark,61,11,,,,,,,,,
21778,Cartman,9,"Hmm.  I can't.  I can't seem to get into your bathroom, Kyle. ",16,Southpark,62,12,,,,,,,,,
21779,Kyle,9,What??,16,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
21780,Cartman,9,"Yeap. No, this is the problem, Kyle.  You've gottam make your bathroom accessible for my mobility scooter or else I won't be able to take a shit in your house. ",16,Southpark,160,30,,,,,,,,,
21781,Kyle,9,So take a shit somewhere else!,16,Southpark,30,6,,,,,,,,,
21782,Cartman,9,"That's not the way this country works, Kyle.  Your bathroom has to be to code for my mobility scooter.  It's the law.",16,Southpark,117,22,,,,,,,,,
21784,Cartman,9,"Can't seem to be able to take a dump in your house, Mr. Broflovski. Doesn't appear to be handicap-accessible.  I'll look past it this time, but you'd better get that bathroom up to code of you don't want a lawsuit.  Well, I'm off to go try to take a shit at Best Buy, guys. See you, Kyle. ",16,Southpark,289,57,,,,,,,,,
21785,Cartman,9,Out of the way. Out of the way please. ,16,Southpark,39,9,,,,,,,,,
21788,Cartman,9,"Coming through. Oh how humiliating.  Scuse me. Gotta go to the front of the line. Oh what shame I feel.  Oh jeez, look how fat I am. I'm just mortified, you guys. Can't believe I have-  Ay! The fuck is this?! There's a wait for the Rascal line?! He-hay! That kid in the middle isn't even fat! Look at him! He's got no right to be on a Rascal! You're not fooling anybody asshole! Walk to the back of the line!",16,Southpark,408,81,,,,,,,,,
21790,Cartman,9,"Yeah, well you got skinny arms!  'Scuse me. Move it.",16,Southpark,52,10,,,,,,,,,
21791,Cartman,9,"And so to go through all that, your honor, to go through all the shame and daily ridicule, and then not to be able to take a simple shit at Best Buy?  At Besty Buy I'm sorry.  To be told by some Best Buy manager that your mobility scooter can't fit in his bathroom?  Oh God, excuse me! It's just so belittling, you know? All I wanted to do was take a dump, your honor. After all I've been through, can't I just take a dump at Best Buy?",16,Southpark,435,89,,,,,,,,,
21795,Cartman,9,"Oh yeah, it's nice. Yeah, that works pretty well. ",16,Southpark,50,9,,,,,,,,,
21796,Kyle,9,You have got to be kidding me!,16,Southpark,30,7,,,,,,,,,
21797,Cartman,9,"What, Kyle?! ",16,Southpark,13,2,,,,,,,,,
21798,Kyle,9,We should not be wasting time and money making sure Cartman's fat scooter can't be tipped over!,16,Southpark,95,17,,,,,,,,,
21799,Cartman,9,"You condone Rascal-tipping, Kyle?! Do you know that all over our country people in mobility scooters are being victimized?!",16,Southpark,123,19,,,,,,,,,
21800,Kyle,9,So get off your fucking scooters and pick them up!,16,Southpark,50,10,,,,,,,,,
21801,Cartman,9,"Oh! Oh, did you hear him?!  This is exactly what Adele is talking about!  Our culture celebrates anorexia and tries to make us ashamed if we don't have slim stomachs and perky little tits like Kyle!  Well I for one am gonna stop feeling ashamed just because Kyle throws up in the bathroom six times a day  to make sure he looks good on his magazine covers!  You should be ashamed of YOURself, Kyle! eating your latkes and gefilte fish and then putting your fingers down your throat because society tells you how to look!  I'm not feeling shamed anymore! From now on, I'm gonna shop sitting down and skip to the front of the lines with my head held high! Just because someone needs a mobility scooter doesn't mean they're an ignorant piece of white trash, Kyle! I may be fat, but I'm not Honey Boo Boo!",16,Southpark,801,148,,,,,,,,,
21802,Kyle,9,Who's Honey Boo Boo?,16,Southpark,20,4,,,,,,,,,
21803,Stan,9,"Dude, you've never seen Honey Boo Boo?",16,Southpark,38,7,,,,,,,,,
21808,Kyle,9,"Jesus, dude. W-w-what happened? It's like, something's lowered the bar to the point that nobody feels any shame anymore.",16,Southpark,120,19,,,,,,,,,
21809,Stan,9,"Well, dude, it's not like the bar is this actual, physical thing.",16,Southpark,65,12,,,,,,,,,
21822,Kyle,9,"Come on, hurry it up in there! ",16,Southpark,31,7,,,,,,,,,
21823,Cartman,9,"Oh yeah, that's good. That's accessible now. Cool, let me try to take a shit in this real quick. ",16,Southpark,97,19,,,,,,,,,
21824,Kyle,9,This has gone far enough!  How can we make people see the difference between being sensitive to obesity and letting fat people walk all over us?!,16,Southpark,145,26,,,,,,,,,
21826,Kyle,9,Yeah! We've gotta raise people's awareness!,16,Southpark,43,6,,,,,,,,,
21828,Kyle,9,"Yeah! g'uh... A, a documentary?",16,Southpark,31,5,,,,,,,,,
21830,Kyle,9,"You, I gu-I guess you're kinda right.",16,Southpark,37,7,,,,,,,,,
21832,Kyle,9,"Really? Thanks, dude! I'm gonna go get a video camera! ",16,Southpark,55,10,,,,,,,,,
21835,Kyle,9,"Ladies and gentlemen, we have an epidemic in our country. Obesity is costing taxpayers millions, and some are taking advantage of a system that is flawed. Over the past several days I have filmed such a case, and the shocking video has been edited by my partner, Token. It is our hope that this film will cast light on a serious issue. ",16,Southpark,336,62,,,,,,,,,
21837,Kyle,9,Fatty Doo Doo?,16,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,
21839,Kyle,9,What?,16,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
21842,Kyle,9,What have you done?,16,Southpark,19,4,,,,,,,,,
21844,Kyle,9,"When we said ""documentary,"" I thought we meant 60 Minutes, not Honey Boo Boo!",16,Southpark,77,14,,,,,,,,,
21846,Kyle,9,"You got Randy Newman to do the theme song. You're not trying that hard. Token, you're a good kid. How can you sit there and collect money on a show that's about a, about a fat child killing himself?? Where's your sense of shame??",16,Southpark,229,44,,,,,,,,,
21848,Kyle,9,"When the bar gets lowered, Token, we all pay the price. What if Honey Boo Boo was a little black girl? Being fattened up by her mom and talking about grits and hominy?",16,Southpark,167,33,,,,,,,,,
21853,Kyle,9,"I just don't know what to do. I mean, I hate Cartman with all my heart, but I can't stop feeling ashamed for taking advantage of him. But should I feel ashamed? Oh, whatever lowered the bar is not my fault. So if I kind of go with it, is it really unfair to Cartman?",16,Southpark,266,55,,,,,,,,,
21854,Stan,9,"I guess not, but... What is it exactly you're trying to do?",16,Southpark,59,12,,,,,,,,,
21855,Kyle,9,"Just, you know, make some money off him. Like Honey Boo boo.",16,Southpark,60,12,,,,,,,,,
21856,Stan,9,"Dude! Dude, not cool!",16,Southpark,21,4,,,,,,,,,
21857,Kyle,9,What?,16,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
21858,Stan,9,Haven't you heard what happened? Honey Boo Boo's heart gave out.,16,Southpark,64,11,,,,,,,,,
21859,Kyle,9,What? Oh my God.,16,Southpark,16,4,,,,,,,,,
21860,Stan,9,Yeah dude. It's really serious.,16,Southpark,31,5,,,,,,,,,
21882,Cartman,9,"It is a violation of my civil rights, Token, and you should be ashamed of yourself!",16,Southpark,83,16,,,,,,,,,
21883,Kyle,9,"I'm sorry Token, I had to tell him. His life is in danger.",16,Southpark,58,13,,,,,,,,,
21884,Cartman,9,"Making money off of people's handicaps! Well Token, I would like you to meet my lawyer!  As soon as he gets in here he will be handing you a cease and desist order! That show is not going to air!",16,Southpark,195,40,,,,,,,,,
21886,Kyle,9,You found a network to buy it?,16,Southpark,30,7,,,,,,,,,
21888,Cartman,9,What? That little bitch beat me in the ratings?! Oh HELL NO!,16,Southpark,60,12,,,,,,,,,
21890,Cartman,9,"I don't give a shit, dude! Nobody beats my ratings! Get me a plane ticket! That bitch is going down! ",16,Southpark,101,20,,,,,,,,,
21893,Cartman,9,"You're goin' down, bitch!  Nobody takes my ratings!",16,Southpark,51,8,,,,,,,,,
21895,Cartman,9,I'm pissed!,16,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
21897,Cartman,9,"Yeah, I'm fat and I'm pissed!",16,Southpark,29,6,,,,,,,,,
21901,Cartman,9,"I ain't done with you, bitch!",16,Southpark,29,6,,,,,,,,,
21907,Stan,9,"Dude, you okay? ",16,Southpark,16,3,,,,,,,,,
21908,Kyle,9,"I've been thinking, how did shamelessness get to this?  Did it start with fat people on scooters? Or did the bar get lowered way before that? And then I started thinking, maybe it was us.  I don't know, but maybe somehow, we lowered the bar, a long time ago.  And now we're all sittin' here in the stink of it all.  There's no going back, Stan. ",16,Southpark,345,66,,,,,,,,,
21911,Kyle,9,Huh?,16,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
21917,Cartman,9,Oh! You fucking bitch! ,16,Southpark,23,4,,,,,,,,,
21919,Kyle,9,I don't know. I think... we've been given another chance.,16,Southpark,57,10,,,,,,,,,
21940,Kyle,10,"Ike, what's the matter?  Dude, you've been in here crying all morning. What's going on?  Oh. My. God. Ike, a-are you sure about this?",16,Southpark,133,24,,,,,,,,,
21942,Kyle,10,"I-Ike, this is a big deal. You have to be absolutely, 100%-",16,Southpark,59,12,,,,,,,,,
21944,Kyle,10,Oh no...,16,Southpark,8,2,,,,,,,,,
21945,Kyle,10,"You guys can't tell anybody, all right? Not until I figure out what to do.",16,Southpark,74,15,,,,,,,,,
21946,Stan,10,"Dude, what happened?",16,Southpark,20,3,,,,,,,,,
21947,Kyle,10,Take a look. ,16,Southpark,13,3,,,,,,,,,
21948,Stan,10,What's this? ,16,Southpark,13,2,,,,,,,,,
21949,Kyle,10,Ike found out last night. My mom's having sex with the UPS man.,16,Southpark,63,13,,,,,,,,,
21950,Stan,10,Whoa!,16,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
21951,Cartman,10,"Dude, no way!",16,Southpark,13,3,,,,,,,,,
21952,Kyle,10,Yeah dude. ,16,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
21953,Stan,10,"But are you sure they had sex, like, ""sex"" sex, or they actually had sex? ",16,Southpark,74,15,,,,,,,,,
21954,Kyle,10,"Yeah dude, like, full-on. Ike saw everything. It totally makes sense now. My mom's been ordering all kinds of stuff from Amazon lately. Sometimes, sh-she doesn't even remember what she's ordered. She's probably been having sex with the UPS man for a long time.",16,Southpark,260,44,,,,,,,,,
21955,Randy,10,Ohhhh... ,16,Southpark,9,1,,,,,,,,,
21956,Stan,10,Well are you gonna tell your dad?,16,Southpark,33,7,,,,,,,,,
21957,Kyle,10,I don't know. I feel like I should confront my mom first. But it's so embarrassing.,16,Southpark,83,16,,,,,,,,,
21958,Cartman,10,"Kyle, have you stopped to think that maybe the sex wasn't consensual?",16,Southpark,69,12,,,,,,,,,
21959,Kyle,10,What?,16,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
21960,Cartman,10,"Isn't it possible your mom was raped by the UPS man? We know nothing about this guy and he shows up to all of our houses. Think about it: what kind of sane, normal person would wanna have sex with Kyle's mom?",16,Southpark,208,42,,,,,,,,,
21961,Stan,10,"Cartman dude, not now.",16,Southpark,22,4,,,,,,,,,
21962,Cartman,10,"No, hear me out, you guys. Haven't you seen those ADT commercials? ""Women these days get raped by perfectly normal-looking white guys in broad daylight."" It may be too late for Kyle's mom, but I'm getting some God damned security!",16,Southpark,230,40,,,,,,,,,
21963,Randy,10,"Look, look, the thing is, do we tell Gerald, or do we just stay out of it?",16,Southpark,74,17,,,,,,,,,
21967,Randy,10,"Oh, come on, he can't be trying that with all our wives?",16,Southpark,56,12,,,,,,,,,
21970,Cartman,10,"Oh no, really?",16,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,
21972,Cartman,10,"Mom, do you wanna get raped?! Haven't you seen their commercials?! You can get raped by a white guy these days, Mom!",16,Southpark,116,22,,,,,,,,,
21975,Cartman,10,What-what do you mean?,16,Southpark,22,4,,,,,,,,,
21977,Cartman,10,"Oh my God, I knew it! Kyle is always taking my stuff! Just yesterday I couldn't find my iPod headphones! That sneaky little Jew!",16,Southpark,128,24,,,,,,,,,
21979,Cartman,10,Yeah Mom! There's dangerous people trying to screw us both!,16,Southpark,59,10,,,,,,,,,
21981,Randy,10,"No, I think I'll uh, ...just hang out a little longer.  I'll get it. ",16,Southpark,69,14,,,,,,,,,
21983,Randy,10,"Oh, is that so?",16,Southpark,15,4,,,,,,,,,
21985,Randy,10,"Sure um... Chad, is it?",16,Southpark,23,5,,,,,,,,,
21987,Randy,10,"Thad. Nice. You um, havin' a busy day?",16,Southpark,38,8,,,,,,,,,
21989,Randy,10,Yeah I'll bet. ,16,Southpark,15,3,,,,,,,,,
21991,Randy,10,"Yeah, you too, Thad.  Hey Sharon, these came for you.",16,Southpark,53,10,,,,,,,,,
21993,Randy,10,"Yeah, w-what are they?",16,Southpark,22,4,,,,,,,,,
21995,Randy,10,You just... order stuff off of Amazon and you can't remember what?,16,Southpark,66,12,,,,,,,,,
21997,Randy,10,"Yeah, sure, 'cause...  people just order stuff from Amazon and... forget what they got. ",16,Southpark,88,14,,,,,,,,,
21998,Randy,10,"Stan, you got something from Amazon.  Oh.  Ooohhh shit.",16,Southpark,55,9,,,,,,,,,
21999,Cartman,10,Oh fuck.  Oh what's the- God damn it!  Hello?,16,Southpark,45,9,,,,,,,,,
22001,Cartman,10,"Uh yeah, sorry, I live here, I just, I can't remember the code to turn off the alarm!",16,Southpark,85,18,,,,,,,,,
22003,Cartman,10,"Oh yeah yeah, my pass phrase is... Kyle is a dirty no-good Jew.  No wait, Kyle is a no-good lying Jew.",16,Southpark,102,21,,,,,,,,,
22005,Cartman,10,"Uhhh, it is My friend Kyle is a no-good dirty...? Hang on, I've got it written down here somewhere.",16,Southpark,99,19,,,,,,,,,
22007,Cartman,10,Sorry about this.,16,Southpark,17,3,,,,,,,,,
22009,Cartman,10,"'Kay, thanks, I... Wait! Hang on a second! What do you mean ""That's all right""! What if I was somebody trying to rape my mom?!",16,Southpark,126,25,,,,,,,,,
22011,Cartman,10,"That's nice, you're so cool about me triggering the alarm and not knowing the password, but how do you know I'm not making it up?! I could have raped my mom twice by now!",16,Southpark,170,34,,,,,,,,,
22013,Cartman,10,"I do, but you don't know that! I could be Kyle trying to take more of my shit!",16,Southpark,78,18,,,,,,,,,
22014,Randy,10,How did you get rid of him?  How did you get rid of the milkman?,16,Southpark,64,15,,,,,,,,,
22017,Randy,10,You said we wouldn't be prepared to get rid of him. How did you?,16,Southpark,64,14,,,,,,,,,
22020,Cartman,10,"You'll get your money when you finish doing what I asked you, all right? Now as soon as I lock the door, just give me a few seconds to arm the system, then you break in and try to rape my mom. Okay? You got it?  Hello?",16,Southpark,218,47,,,,,,,,,
22022,Cartman,10,"Uh, no, a man just broke into our house and he's about to rape my mom.  Go go, she's upstairs.  Hello, did you hear me? A rapist is here; he's white!",16,Southpark,149,31,,,,,,,,,
22024,Cartman,10,Yes you should contact the fucking police! My mom is about to get fucking raped!,16,Southpark,80,15,,,,,,,,,
22026,Cartman,10,"He's goin' up the stairs, dude, you'd better hurry!",16,Southpark,51,9,,,,,,,,,
22028,Cartman,10,"Well that's nice, maybe they could bring some cigarettes and Gatorade, 'cause the guy's gonna be pretty wiped out!  The fuck?!",16,Southpark,126,21,,,,,,,,,
22035,Randy,10,You should have left our wives alone. Now let's go for a drive.,16,Southpark,63,13,,,,,,,,,
22037,Randy,10,"Oh no, pull in here.",16,Southpark,20,5,,,,,,,,,
22039,Randy,10,"Oh, and then we'd miss out on all the fun! ",16,Southpark,43,10,,,,,,,,,
22045,Randy,10,Thought we wouldn't find out??? ,16,Southpark,32,5,,,,,,,,,
22046,Cartman,10,Who is there?,16,Southpark,13,3,,,,,,,,,
22048,Cartman,10,"Oh?! Ohhh?!  Yes? Yeah, hello?",16,Southpark,30,5,,,,,,,,,
22050,Cartman,10,A man just broke into my house and is-  Varashnu? I didn't sign up to have some Indian guy call me- Are you even in the United States?!,16,Southpark,135,28,,,,,,,,,
22052,Cartman,10,"Oh, that is bullshit! Put your manager on!",16,Southpark,42,8,,,,,,,,,
22054,Cartman,10,Heh- hello?,16,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
22056,Cartman,10,"No, everything's not all right. How come a guy from India is calling me when my house is being broken into?!",16,Southpark,108,21,,,,,,,,,
22058,Cartman,10,"Dude, I'm not paying all this money to have some guy on the other side of the Earth try and protect me!",16,Southpark,103,22,,,,,,,,,
22060,Cartman,10,"Oh really? Oh okay. Gosh I'm so relieved! Thanks. There's still just one little problem: How do you know I didn't break into this house, set off the alarm, and now I'm stalling by being upset about the Indian guy and have actually stolen a bunch of shit, raped my mom, and you people have done absolutely nothing about it?!",16,Southpark,323,60,,,,,,,,,
22062,Cartman,10,Yeah I just fucked your head and the UPS guy just fucked my mom! ,16,Southpark,65,14,,,,,,,,,
22066,Randy,10,Wouldn't be the only ones in your family completely in the dark.,16,Southpark,64,12,,,,,,,,,
22068,Randy,10,Huh? Nothing.,16,Southpark,13,2,,,,,,,,,
22071,Randy,10,"Whoawhoa, wait, wait. What do you mean?",16,Southpark,39,7,,,,,,,,,
22090,Kyle,10,It just keeps getting worse. I see stuff from Amazon almost every day. My poor dad has no idea.,16,Southpark,95,19,,,,,,,,,
22091,Stan,10,"You're gonna have to tell him, dude.",16,Southpark,36,7,,,,,,,,,
22092,Kyle,10,I know...,16,Southpark,9,2,,,,,,,,,
22093,Cartman,10,HaHA Kyle! Let's see you try and take my iPod headphones HOW! ,16,Southpark,62,12,,,,,,,,,
22094,Kyle,10,What?!,16,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
22095,Cartman,10,"Just wanted you to know that if you wanna steal somebody's stuff, you should look elsewhere.",16,Southpark,92,16,,,,,,,,,
22096,Kyle,10,"Nobody wants any of your stuff, you fat bitch!",16,Southpark,46,9,,,,,,,,,
22097,Cartman,10,"Oh, fat bitch, huh?!  Well it just so happens that this fat bitch has INsecurity now, Kyle, and so I'm protected from ALL you greedy little Jews until you and your people DIE OUT!",16,Southpark,179,34,,,,,,,,,
22098,Kyle,10,"The Jewish population isn't dying out, fatass! It's growing!",16,Southpark,60,9,,,,,,,,,
22099,Cartman,10,What?  Hello?,16,Southpark,13,2,,,,,,,,,
22101,Cartman,10,"Yeah yeah no, false alarm. I, I just heard some troubling news and it set off my INsecurity.",16,Southpark,92,18,,,,,,,,,
22103,Cartman,10,"Yeah, it's um... it's uloveboobs.",16,Southpark,33,5,,,,,,,,,
22105,Cartman,10,"No, ""uloveboobs."" Lower-case u love boobs.",16,Southpark,42,6,,,,,,,,,
22107,Cartman,10,My password is uloveboobs!,16,Southpark,26,4,,,,,,,,,
22109,Cartman,10,"You, it's fucking hilarious! Now can you shut off my INsecurity please?!",16,Southpark,72,12,,,,,,,,,
22111,Cartman,10,"Okay. So anyway, Kyle, you'd better watch ih-!  Kyle? God damn it.",16,Southpark,66,12,,,,,,,,,
22112,Randy,10,"And then I had to drive to Walgreens, Barnes & Noble AND Ace Hardware. I tell you, having to go around and buy stuff again sucks.",16,Southpark,129,26,,,,,,,,,
22119,Randy,10,Oh my God! ,16,Southpark,11,3,,,,,,,,,
22121,Randy,10,We scared him! We thought that'd be enough!,16,Southpark,43,8,,,,,,,,,
22124,Randy,10,This guy doesn't know when to quit!,16,Southpark,35,7,,,,,,,,,
22127,Randy,10,"Sorry sorry, that's me.  Hello?",16,Southpark,31,5,,,,,,,,,
22129,Randy,10,"Yeah, sorry, false alarm. Pass phrase is tickle me homo.  It's a joke.",16,Southpark,70,13,,,,,,,,,
22130,Kyle,10,"Mom, Dad, you've always taught me that being direct and honest is a basic Jewish tenet.",16,Southpark,87,16,,,,,,,,,
22132,Kyle,10,"And that applies to all of us, doesn't it? Even though it's convenient to have things done for you, sometimes it's best to deal with it yourself. ",16,Southpark,146,27,,,,,,,,,
22134,Kyle,10,"Yeah. Come in for a minute, would you?",16,Southpark,38,8,,,,,,,,,
22136,Kyle,10,"Please? I need you to come sit down for a second.  So... Here we all are. Mom, do you want to tell Dad something?  Mom?",16,Southpark,119,25,,,,,,,,,
22138,Kyle,10,"You know God damned well what's going on! This ends right now! We are a family, and you need to go somewhere else!",16,Southpark,114,23,,,,,,,,,
22145,Cartman,10,"Yeah, no, false alarm again. I'm in the store and some fat bitch asked me if my dad likes cologne.",16,Southpark,98,20,,,,,,,,,
22151,Randy,10,"Yeah, I'm thinking maybe Gerald's house is nicer than mine is.",16,Southpark,62,11,,,,,,,,,
22153,Cartman,10,"God damn it I've had it with you people! When I signed up, I thought I was getting CSI guys protecting my ass, but all of you answering the phones are complete retards! Hello? ",16,Southpark,176,34,,,,,,,,,
22156,Kyle,10,"Dude, come down here!",16,Southpark,21,4,,,,,,,,,
22162,Randy,10,Yours? What?,16,Southpark,12,2,,,,,,,,,
22164,Kyle,10,"Wait a minute, Dad was the UPS man?",16,Southpark,35,8,,,,,,,,,
22167,Randy,10,It's over. But you were wrong. We don't have to be afraid of Amazon. The only price to be paid for convenience is that we must be secure with ourselves.,16,Southpark,152,30,,,,,,,,,
22170,Cartman,10,"It doesn't matter who we are, what matters is our plan. You should have respected my authoritay. ",16,Southpark,97,17,,,,,,,,,
22172,Cartman,11,FELLAS! Fellas!,16,Southpark,15,2,,,,,,,,,
22173,Stan,11,What?,16,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
22174,Cartman,11,You'll never guess what happened. Butters just beat up Scott Malkinson!,16,Southpark,71,11,,,,,,,,,
22175,Kyle,11,Butters?  Why?,16,Southpark,14,2,,,,,,,,,
22176,Cartman,11,"It was crazy! Scott was just talking about how he needed to take his insulin shot, and out of nowhere Butters said he's sick of people with diabetes feeling sorry for themselves. Scott told Butters to shut up and Butters just started whaling on him!",16,Southpark,249,45,,,,,,,,,
22177,Stan,11,You're talking about Butters.,16,Southpark,29,4,,,,,,,,,
22178,Cartman,11,"Dude, I'm telling you! Butters beat the crap out of Scott, and then he locked himself in the bathroom! ",16,Southpark,103,19,,,,,,,,,
22179,Stan,11,Butters?,16,Southpark,8,1,,,,,,,,,
22180,Butters,11,Leave me alone!,16,Southpark,15,3,,,,,,,,,
22181,Stan,11,"Butters, come out here.",16,Southpark,23,4,,,,,,,,,
22182,Butters,11,"Get out of here, all of ya! ",16,Southpark,28,7,,,,,,,,,
22183,Kyle,11,"Butters, people can't just go around beating up people who have diabetes! Now whatever your problem is, you just-",16,Southpark,113,19,,,,,,,,,
22184,Butters,11,"You just think you know everything, don't you Kyle?! Every little thing you gotta shoot your mouth off like you're the frickin' expert! Well you don't know everything because  your best friend is a kid who thinks the entire planet revolves around him and he only cares about HIS image!  You guys think Cartman is the only selfish piece of crap in this school? You're all fake and stuck up , and none of you have the courage to tell Jimmy that his jokes aren't funny!  The only kid here with any sense of dignity is Kenny, and the rest of you have your heads up your butts! ",16,Southpark,573,108,,,,,,,,,
22185,Cartman,11,"Well. Apparently Kenny is Butters' best friend. You guys gonna make out, Kenny? ",16,Southpark,80,13,,,,,,,,,
22186,Butters,11,And that's another thing! You're always trivializing everything I say by gettin' the last word! Well you're not gettin' the last word this time! ,16,Southpark,145,24,,,,,,,,,
22187,Cartman,11,...Wow.,16,Southpark,7,1,,,,,,,,,
22188,Butters,11,Double wow! ,16,Southpark,12,2,,,,,,,,,
22191,Butters,11,"I don't know, Dad, ah I was just pissed off, I guess!",16,Southpark,53,12,,,,,,,,,
22193,Butters,11,"I don't suppose it is, but I don't give a darn!",16,Southpark,47,11,,,,,,,,,
22195,Butters,11,"Why don't you shut up, Dad, and stick it in your ear, for cryin' out loud! ",16,Southpark,75,16,,,,,,,,,
22200,Butters,11,It's not?!,16,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,
22202,Butters,11,Yeah?,16,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
22204,Butters,11,"Hey yeah, all the time.",16,Southpark,23,5,,,,,,,,,
22212,Butters,11,Will somebody tell me what the frickity fookshmere is goin' on?!,16,Southpark,64,11,,,,,,,,,
22214,Butters,11,Uhbu-but I'm from here.,16,Southpark,23,4,,,,,,,,,
22216,Butters,11,We're from Hawaii?,16,Southpark,18,3,,,,,,,,,
22218,Butters,11,But what does being Hawaiian have to do with me acting like an emo chick on her period?,16,Southpark,87,18,,,,,,,,,
22220,Cartman,11,"Holy shit balls! Holy shit balls! Guess what, you guys? Holy shit balls. ",16,Southpark,73,13,,,,,,,,,
22221,Kyle,11,What?,16,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
22222,Cartman,11,Butters just got on a bus with his backpack and said he's going to Hawaii.,16,Southpark,74,15,,,,,,,,,
22223,Stan,11,Hawaii?,16,Southpark,7,1,,,,,,,,,
22224,Cartman,11,"He said he had to go back to his homeland, and then told me it was none of my business and to keep my fat mouth shut.",16,Southpark,117,27,,,,,,,,,
22225,Kyle,11,"Dude, what the hell? Somebody's gotta stop him.",16,Southpark,47,8,,,,,,,,,
22226,Stan,11,"After all the things he said to us, he can go ahead. ",16,Southpark,53,12,,,,,,,,,
22227,Kyle,11,"Kenny, you're clearly his best friend. Go stop him.",16,Southpark,51,9,,,,,,,,,
22228,Kenny,11,,16,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
22229,Cartman,11,"Yeah, Mr. Perfect, go rescue Butters so he can lick your balls some more. ",16,Southpark,74,14,,,,,,,,,
22230,Kenny,11,,16,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
22231,Butters,11,"They won't let me on the plane. Why, I can't do anything right!  No, no! I have to go to Hawaii, Kenny! I have no idea what's waiting there for me, but I guh, I can't go on like this! ",16,Southpark,184,40,,,,,,,,,
22232,Kenny,11,,16,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
22234,Butters,11,"I'm not intoxicated, you skank! I'm just ""deligerent"" because of my hapanuanalua!",16,Southpark,81,12,,,,,,,,,
22235,Kenny,11,,16,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
22237,Kenny,11,,16,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
22238,Butters,11,Can't you see I'm in horrible pain?! Do you have any idea what-?!,16,Southpark,65,13,,,,,,,,,
22239,Kenny,11, ,16,Southpark,1,0,,,,,,,,,
22240,Butters,11,"Well, we're here, now what do I do? ",16,Southpark,36,8,,,,,,,,,
22242,Butters,11,"Uh yeah, I uh, I'm not sure where I'm supposed to go?",16,Southpark,53,12,,,,,,,,,
22244,Butters,11,"Oh, ah, I'm not a tourist. I'm a native Hawaiian. ",16,Southpark,50,10,,,,,,,,,
22246,Butters,11,Yeah?,16,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
22248,Butters,11,"Oh thi-this is my friend, Kenny.",16,Southpark,32,6,,,,,,,,,
22250,Butters,11,"Oh please, i-if it weren't for him I couldn't have come.",16,Southpark,56,11,,,,,,,,,
22252,Butters,11,You folks are all native Hawaiians too?,16,Southpark,39,7,,,,,,,,,
22257,Butters,11,"What's ""saimin""?",16,Southpark,16,2,,,,,,,,,
22264,Kenny,11,"My dearest friends.I am living amongst the natives in the remote and tiny island of Kava'i. What can I tell you of this mysterious island and its people? It is a place of wonder, and yet to the outsider like me, a place of odd tradition. The people here are peaceful and joyous, and seem to care little for the rush and worry of the outside world. Their diet is mostly an odd mixture of coconut milk, pineapple juice, and vodka, which they call the chi-chi.

22680,Stan,13,"You're wearing a brown bracelet, Butters?",16,Southpark,41,6,,,,,,,,,
22681,Butters,13,Well yeah.  It helps remind me that I shouldn't back down anymore when I feel pressure from other people. I just got really moved when I saw what did for all those farmers in Belarus. ,16,Southpark,184,35,,,,,,,,,
22682,Stan,13,...Farmers in where?,16,Southpark,20,3,,,,,,,,,

22732,Stan,13,Thanks Kyle.,16,Southpark,12,2,,,,,,,,,
22733,Kyle,13,You probably should come clean and tell the truth. Did you superglue your bracelet?,16,Southpark,83,14,,,,,,,,,
22734,Stan,13,Why does it matter?!,16,Southpark,20,4,,,,,,,,,
22735,Kyle,13,Because you kind of made it matter.,16,Southpark,35,7,,,,,,,,,

22740,Stan,13,"You really think I went through all that trouble, lying about my wristband and claiming to be something I wasn't, for what, Kyle?! For what?!  This is a witch hunt, dude! It's all that stupid French scientist! He's the fraud, and I'm gonna prove it!",16,Southpark,249,45,,,,,,,,,
22755,Stan,13,Jesus!,16,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
22757,Stan,13,What are you doing here?,16,Southpark,24,5,,,,,,,,,
22762,Stan,13,"Jesus, everyone is claiming you were using drugs to resurrect. Why didn't you say anything?",16,Southpark,91,15,,,,,,,,,
22764,Stan,13,"Yeah, I've been kind of seein' that.",16,Southpark,36,7,,,,,,,,,
22766,Stan,13,It all just happened so fast. The next thing I knew I had a Nike commercial.,16,Southpark,76,16,,,,,,,,,
22768,Stan,13,"Everyone hates me now, and it isn't fair.",16,Southpark,41,8,,,,,,,,,

22779,Stan,13,Exactly! People don't even know where it is.,16,Southpark,44,8,,,,,,,,,
22781,Stan,13,How can we raise awareness?,16,Southpark,27,5,,,,,,,,,
22784,Stan,13,"Well, we wanted to start a new movement, and we thought since your company makes all the bracelets...",16,Southpark,101,18,,,,,,,,,
22786,Stan,13,Our... scause?,16,Southpark,14,2,,,,,,,,,
22790,Stan,13,"Dude, the hell just happen?",16,Southpark,27,5,,,,,,,,,

22798,Cartman,13,"...Oh, I guess I do care about that. Huh.",16,Southpark,41,9,,,,,,,,,
22799,Butters,13,"Hey Stan, well, some people are sayin' that you knew what you were doing all along. That, that you, you cut off your wristband on purpose to shed light on the Belarusian farmers.",16,Southpark,178,33,,,,,,,,,
22800,Stan,13,People are saying that? ,16,Southpark,24,4,,,,,,,,,
22801,Butters,13,Yeeah. Is it true?,16,Southpark,18,4,,,,,,,,,
22802,Stan,13,"Wow! You know, whatever it takes, Butters. People are aware of the problems in Belarus; maybe I did it all on purpose or maybe it was just a coincidence.",16,Southpark,153,29,,,,,,,,,
22803,Butters,13,"Heyah, whatever Stan. Yeah I thought you were a butthole,  but n-now I think you're a good sneaky little butthole. ",16,Southpark,115,20,,,,,,,,,
22804,Stan,13,We did it. ,16,Southpark,11,3,,,,,,,,,

22822,Kyle,13,Heidi Turner said you asked her to borrow superglue last week.,16,Southpark,62,11,,,,,,,,,
22823,Stan,13,Are you still on that dude?! Have you ever heard of ends justifying means?! ,16,Southpark,76,14,,,,,,,,,

22827,Cartman,13,"...Fuck! Dude, weak. ",16,Southpark,21,3,,,,,,,,,
22828,Stan,13,"It's almost like... like, that guy had this figured out all along.",16,Southpark,66,12,,,,,,,,,
22830,Stan,13,We were trying to do good. But we got everyone duped by a bracelet company.,16,Southpark,75,15,,,,,,,,,
22832,Stan,13,Well... we can't just let that guy get away with taking everyone's money.,16,Southpark,73,13,,,,,,,,,
22834,Stan,13,What would Jesus do?  Yeheah! ,16,Southpark,30,5,,,,,,,,,
22842,Cartman,14,Mom? Mommy? Where's my mommy?,16,Southpark,29,5,,,,,,,,,

22864,Cartman,14,Hey Kyle. What's up?,16,Southpark,20,4,,,,,,,,,
22865,Kyle,14,"Nothing, watching the election results.",16,Southpark,39,5,,,,,,,,,
22866,Cartman,14,"Yeah, I figured. It's the day after the election, so you're probably sitting on the couch telling your little brother how great it is to live in a democratic society.  Listen, Kyle, could you come over for a second? I got somethin' I need to show you.",16,Southpark,251,47,,,,,,,,,
22867,Kyle,14,What?!,16,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
22868,Cartman,14,"Please, Kyle. It's kind of important.",16,Southpark,37,6,,,,,,,,,
22869,Kyle,14,"Alright, what is this all about, fatass?!",16,Southpark,41,7,,,,,,,,,
22870,Cartman,14,"You happy with the election results last night, Kyle?",16,Southpark,53,9,,,,,,,,,
22871,Kyle,14,It doesn't matter if I am or not. People voted and I stand behind the president.,16,Southpark,80,16,,,,,,,,,
22872,Cartman,14,"Oh, that's such a democratic thing to say, Kyle. What if I were to tell you that I have something in my room that could change the entire election? ",16,Southpark,148,29,,,,,,,,,
22873,Kyle,14,Sure you do!,16,Southpark,12,3,,,,,,,,,
22874,Cartman,14,"What if I did, Kyle?",16,Southpark,20,5,,,,,,,,,
22875,Kyle,14,"Chr, what could you possibly have in your room that could change the outcome of the election? ",16,Southpark,94,17,,,,,,,,,
22876,Cartman,14,"Pretty sweet, huh?",16,Southpark,18,3,,,,,,,,,
22877,Kyle,14,What the hell is this?,16,Southpark,22,5,,,,,,,,,
22878,Cartman,14,What's it look like? Hundreds of thousands of votes from all the swing states.,16,Southpark,78,14,,,,,,,,,
22879,Kyle,14,I don't believe it.,16,Southpark,19,4,,,,,,,,,
22880,Cartman,14,"No, really. There are states full of swingers. Bunch of perverts if you ask me.",16,Southpark,79,15,,,,,,,,,
22881,Kyle,14,Why do you have these?,16,Southpark,22,5,,,,,,,,,
22882,Cartman,14,"Funny how voting works in this country, isn't it, Kyle.  Each one of these, a person. Someone who actually took the time to get themselves informed. Actually got up and drove to a voting area to make sure their voice was heard. ",16,Southpark,228,42,,,,,,,,,
22883,Kyle,14,Dude!,16,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
22884,Cartman,14,Here's another patriotic American. He probably spent hours listening to all those presidential ads and tuned in to every debate. ,16,Southpark,129,20,,,,,,,,,
22885,Kyle,14,"Knock it off, Cartman!",16,Southpark,22,4,,,,,,,,,
22886,Cartman,14,"Now, believe it or not, Kyle, I actually need your help. But first you have to promise not to tell anyone.",16,Southpark,106,21,,,,,,,,,
22887,Kyle,14,"You're not getting away with this, you fat turd! ",16,Southpark,49,9,,,,,,,,,
22888,Cartman,14,"Run now, little firefly. It's all part of the plan.",16,Southpark,51,10,,,,,,,,,
22890,Cartman,14,"Thanks Mom,  I'll take that in the study. Do I have a study? I don't think I have a study. That's fine.",16,Southpark,103,22,,,,,,,,,
22904,Cartman,14,"Hmmm, no.",16,Southpark,9,2,,,,,,,,,
22906,Cartman,14,"I'm sorry, but I know my rights. You can't search my room without a warrant. And I'm afraid I can't give you permission.",16,Southpark,120,23,,,,,,,,,
22907,Kyle,14,"This isn't a joke, Cartman! You have to believe me, officer. The outcome of the election depends on it.",16,Southpark,103,19,,,,,,,,,
22909,Cartman,14,Ey! You can't do that! Ey!,16,Southpark,26,6,,,,,,,,,
22910,Kyle,14,Upstairs! First door to the left!,16,Southpark,33,6,,,,,,,,,
22911,Cartman,14,I know my rights! Stop right now! ,16,Southpark,34,7,,,,,,,,,
22912,Kyle,14,But... they were here. Ah I swear it. Stacks and stacks of ballots from states all over the country!,16,Southpark,100,19,,,,,,,,,
22913,Cartman,14,"I was always told that... we lived in a country based on freedom. That the one thing that made America different was that government could never barge into our lives unwarranted. But it's all changing, isn't it? Ever since Obama was first elected, it's all changing.",16,Southpark,266,46,,,,,,,,,
22916,Kyle,14,"Please you've, you've got to believe me! They've still gotta be here somewhere! Uh we've got to find them!",16,Southpark,106,19,,,,,,,,,
22917,Cartman,14,"But where could they be? Where? And why would I care so much about the election results? So may questions, Kyle. So... little time. ",16,Southpark,132,24,,,,,,,,,
22918,Kyle,14,Guys! You guys!  Listen: Cartman has tens of thousands of voter ballots hidden somewhere. He's changed the outcome of the election!,16,Southpark,131,21,,,,,,,,,
22919,Stan,14,"Wow, really? That's pretty impressive.",16,Southpark,38,5,,,,,,,,,
22920,Kyle,14,Come on guys! He's hidden them somewhere and we have to find them!,16,Southpark,66,13,,,,,,,,,
22921,Stan,14,But I thought Obama won pretty easily last night.,16,Southpark,49,9,,,,,,,,,
22922,Kyle,14,"Dude, because of the electoral college these votes in swing states can really matter.",16,Southpark,85,14,,,,,,,,,
22923,Stan,14,I don't understand that stuff at all. I need Morgan Freeman to explain it to me.,16,Southpark,80,16,,,,,,,,,
22926,Kyle,14,"God damn it this is serious, you guys! Cartman has stolen the election!",16,Southpark,71,13,,,,,,,,,
22927,Butters,14,"Well, mmmaybe Cartman had a good reason.",16,Southpark,40,7,,,,,,,,,
22928,Kyle,14,"Butters, you know something, don't you?!",16,Southpark,40,6,,,,,,,,,
22929,Butters,14,"Huh? Wha? NO. Uhuh, why?",16,Southpark,24,5,,,,,,,,,
22930,Kyle,14,What did Cartman tell you?!,16,Southpark,27,5,,,,,,,,,
22931,Butters,14,"He didn't tell me nothin'. Annd I'm sworn to secrecy. Ih-it's really important, Kyle, and it isn't what you think.  Uh, don't make me say any more!",16,Southpark,147,27,,,,,,,,,
22932,Kyle,14,Tell us what you know right now!,16,Southpark,32,7,,,,,,,,,
22933,Butters,14,I can't! Don't you see?!  Don't make me swallow this! Wa-I'll do it,16,Southpark,67,13,,,,,,,,,
22934,Stan,14,Is that an M&M?,16,Southpark,15,4,,,,,,,,,

22942,Butters,14,Ah! Bah! I hate almonds. ,16,Southpark,25,5,,,,,,,,,
22944,Cartman,14,"Mm, mhm, mhm.",16,Southpark,13,3,,,,,,,,,
22946,Cartman,14,They're nearby. Very safe and sound. I just might want to... alter our deal a little bit.,16,Southpark,89,17,,,,,,,,,
22948,Cartman,14,Yes. Tell me again exactly what you plan on doing with it?,16,Southpark,58,12,,,,,,,,,
22957,Kyle,14,Can we please just try and talk to him?,16,Southpark,39,9,,,,,,,,,
22959,Butters,14,What's up fellas?,16,Southpark,17,3,,,,,,,,,

22985,Cartman,14,"Oh God damn it Kyle, I was just about to get what I wanted.",16,Southpark,59,14,,,,,,,,,

23055,Stan,14,"Well, I mean, look at it this way: Almost half the country did actually vote for Obama. If the election really just came down to a bunch of boxes Cartman stole, then, does it matter that much?",16,Southpark,192,37,,,,,,,,,
23056,Kyle,14,"It matters, Stan. It it matters.",16,Southpark,32,6,,,,,,,,,

23095,Kyle,1,That is not what happened! You totally started crying and quit the game!,17,Southpark,72,13,,,,,,,,,
23096,Cartman,1,"Kyle, this is a private conversation.",17,Southpark,37,6,,,,,,,,,

23637,Cartman,3,You don't understand. There's no Denver left to go back to! ,17,Southpark,60,11,,,,,,,,,
23651,Cartman,3,Not a chance. By now most of the urban cities will be compromised. This whole things from city to city. We need to go somewhere the trend won't take hold. Like Iceland. ,17,Southpark,169,32,,,,,,,,,

23711,Cartman,3,The other way to stop the outbreak. Token isn't the only Patient Zero. The outbreak won't happen if... we shoot George Zimmerman. We have to get to Florida!,17,Southpark,156,28,,,,,,,,,

23759,Cartman,3,"Uh oh.  Sounds like you're still angry, Token.",17,Southpark,46,8,,,,,,,,,
23761,Cartman,3,"Alright Token, come on! This is ridiculous. I know you totally wanna kick my ass right now. You'd like to walk right up and punch me in the face, but what's that gonna solve?

23769,Kyle,3,That's what bothering you? Not the fact that you're a murderer?,17,Southpark,63,11,,,,,,,,,
23770,Cartman,3,"Jury found me innocent, Kyle!",17,Southpark,29,5,,,,,,,,,
23771,Kyle,3,You're a murderer.,17,Southpark,18,3,,,,,,,,,

I thought only humans could be gingers. Is Davin here? Davin Miller?  Oh yeah, there you are. I own an apology to you too, Davin. When Kyle said that humans weren't the only species that can have light skin and freckles I totally laughed in his face. But it turns out Kyle was right: there are other animals that can be ginger as well I didn't believe it. I guess I didn't want to believe it, but this morning I saw a red-haired light-skinned cow and I owe you, Kyle, and you, Davin, my sincerest apology.",17,Southpark,664,124,,,,,,,,,

24407,Kyle,6,Yummy yummy.,17,Southpark,12,2,,,,,,,,,
24416,Stan,6,Hey Kyle.,17,Southpark,9,2,,,,,,,,,
24417,Kyle,6,Hey,17,Southpark,3,1,,,,,,,,,
24418,Stan,6,"Kyle, there's peace in the Middle East. They're saying maybe it's gonna lead to peace all over the world. Everyone's really happy. You should be too.",17,Southpark,149,26,,,,,,,,,

24420,Stan,6,"...Dude, we've been friends a long time. Can you just tell me why you like Cartman's farts so much?",17,Southpark,99,19,,,,,,,,,
24421,Kyle,6,"I just do, Stan.",17,Southpark,16,4,,,,,,,,,
24422,Stan,6,You like... how they smell? How they taste?,17,Southpark,43,8,,,,,,,,,

24426,Stan,6,Should I try them?,17,Southpark,18,4,,,,,,,,,
24427,Kyle,6,NO.,17,Southpark,3,1,,,,,,,,,
24429,Kyle,6,This is Cartman. I have to take it.  Hello?,17,Southpark,43,9,,,,,,,,,
24430,Cartman,6,"Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. What sounds better in your mouth tomorrow? Thai or Greek?",17,Southpark,101,19,,,,,,,,,
24431,Kyle,6,I don't care.,17,Southpark,13,3,,,,,,,,,
24432,Cartman,6,"I care, Kyle. You should have a say in this; they're your yummy farts. Should we go with Thai?",17,Southpark,94,19,,,,,,,,,
24433,Kyle,6,That's fine. ,17,Southpark,13,2,,,,,,,,,
24434,Stan,6,"...Kyle, maybe you should get some help.",17,Southpark,40,7,,,,,,,,,
24435,Kyle,6,"Please, just, just leave it alone, Stan. Everything is as it has to be.",17,Southpark,71,14,,,,,,,,,
24436,Stan,6,"I don't get it, Kenny.",17,Southpark,22,5,,,,,,,,,
24437,Kenny,6,,17,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
24438,Stan,6,"Well whatever it is, we have to figure it out. I think all those farts are starting to get to Kyle's head.",17,Southpark,106,22,,,,,,,,,
24439,Kyle,6,"No more. No more. Oh, come on, Cartman, no. No more. ",17,Southpark,53,11,,,,,,,,,
24441,Kyle,6,Huh? Who...? Who is that?,17,Southpark,25,5,,,,,,,,,
24443,Kyle,6,I... because the world is at peace. I must endure.,17,Southpark,50,10,,,,,,,,,
24445,Kyle,6,I... I know.,17,Southpark,12,3,,,,,,,,,
24447,Kyle,6,"That's, that that's k-kind of what I was thinking.",17,Southpark,50,9,,,,,,,,,
24449,Kyle,6,Yes.,17,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
24450,Kyle,6,I endure what I must for the sake of all humanity.,17,Southpark,50,11,,,,,,,,,
24452,Cartman,6,"You're gonna... come with me... to Israel, Kyle? ",17,Southpark,49,8,,,,,,,,,
24453,Kyle,6,Yes! Yes I will!,17,Southpark,16,4,,,,,,,,,
24454,Cartman,6,Huh? You comin'? ,17,Southpark,17,3,,,,,,,,,
24455,Kyle,6,"Yes, whatever you want. ",17,Southpark,24,4,,,,,,,,,
24456,Cartman,6,Okay. I want the whole world to see how much you love my farts. Plane leaves tomorrow. ,17,Southpark,87,17,,,,,,,,,
24457,Stan,6,"Kyle, don't do this. Don't eat Cartman's farts in front of the whole world.",17,Southpark,75,14,,,,,,,,,
24458,Butters,6,"Just stop, please.",17,Southpark,18,3,,,,,,,,,
24459,Kyle,6,"It's okay. Everyone, it's okay. Perhaps one day, you will all understand. What I do, I do because I care about each and every one of you. ",17,Southpark,138,27,,,,,,,,,
24461,Stan,6,Hey Kyle.,17,Southpark,9,2,,,,,,,,,
24462,Kyle,6,"Hello, Stan.",17,Southpark,12,2,,,,,,,,,
24463,Stan,6,"Um, dude, we need to talk. This has to stop.",17,Southpark,44,10,,,,,,,,,
24464,Kyle,6,There are greater things at work than what you understand.,17,Southpark,58,10,,,,,,,,,
24465,Stan,6,"If you wanna suck farts, Kyle, that's fine. Go ahead. But you can't suck farts and be a dick about it.",17,Southpark,102,21,,,,,,,,,
24466,Kyle,6,I'm actually the complete opposite.,17,Southpark,35,5,,,,,,,,,
24467,Stan,6,All of a sudden you seem to think you're above everyone else!,17,Southpark,61,12,,,,,,,,,
24468,Kyle,6,"I'm not better, I'm just... doing what needs to be done to make the world a better place.",17,Southpark,89,18,,,,,,,,,
24469,Stan,6,See? You sound like a dick.,17,Southpark,27,6,,,,,,,,,
24470,Kyle,6,I happen to be the one person who's putting everyone else's needs before their own!,17,Southpark,83,15,,,,,,,,,
24471,Stan,6,"Dick! That's a dick talking! You've had too much of Cartman's farts and you got sulphur poisoning, and now you're a dick.",17,Southpark,121,22,,,,,,,,,
24472,Kyle,6,"All you need to know is I'm way awesomer than you think, okay?!",17,Southpark,63,13,,,,,,,,,
24473,Stan,6,I don't think Kyle really loves Cartman's farts. There's something else going on.,17,Southpark,81,13,,,,,,,,,
24474,Kenny,6,,17,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
24475,Stan,6,"This all started with the stupid peace in the Middle East, Kenny. For some reason it's making Kyle crazy. We've gotta get to the bottom of this!",17,Southpark,144,27,,,,,,,,,
24477,Cartman,6,"Thank you everyone. It's my honor to have been a part of this... miracle. Isn't that right, Fartboy?",17,Southpark,100,18,,,,,,,,,
24478,Kyle,6,Could I please one of your piping-hot farts in my mouth?,17,Southpark,56,11,,,,,,,,,
24479,Cartman,6,"Are you sure, Fartboy? I've had a lot of strange food on this trip.",17,Southpark,67,14,,,,,,,,,
24480,Kyle,6,Yummy yummy I want your farts in my tummy.,17,Southpark,42,9,,,,,,,,,
24483,Stan,6,"Yes, there's something that you all need to know. The truth about the red cow. We have all been  So- sorry, hang on.  Hello?",17,Southpark,124,24,,,,,,,,,
24484,Kyle,6,Dude! Do not do this!,17,Southpark,21,5,,,,,,,,,
24485,Stan,6,"No, dude, you don't understand. Cartman hasn't been telling the truth!",17,Southpark,70,11,,,,,,,,,
24486,Kyle,6,"Yes, I know that! Why do you think I've been putting up with his farts?!",17,Southpark,72,15,,,,,,,,,
24487,Stan,6,Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.,17,Southpark,18,1,,,,,,,,,
24489,Kyle,6,"I know Cartman made it all up, okay?! I also know that nothing is more important for humanity than peace in the Middle East! I'm okay with this, Stan!",17,Southpark,150,29,,,,,,,,,
24490,Stan,6,"Well, I'm not okay with it, 'cause it's turned you into a dick, Kyle!",17,Southpark,69,14,,,,,,,,,
24491,Kyle,6,"I'm not a dick, I'm like Gandhi!",17,Southpark,32,7,,,,,,,,,
24492,Stan,6,"You know, I don't think when Gandhi starved himself he was all ""Dude, look how fuckin' awesome I am for starving. Check me out!""",17,Southpark,128,24,,,,,,,,,
24493,Kyle,6,"Okay, okay. Stan, you're right. Maybe I let being a martyr go to my head. Just please, let me stay on this path, and, I'll try to be cool about it. Okay? I'm sorry.",17,Southpark,164,34,,,,,,,,,
24494,Stan,6,You should apologize to Kenny too.,17,Southpark,34,6,,,,,,,,,
24495,Kyle,6,"I'm sorry, Kenny!",17,Southpark,17,3,,,,,,,,,
24496,Kenny,6,,17,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
24498,Stan,6,The red cow... I saw it too. Ih it came down from the sky in a flash of light. It was a miracle.,17,Southpark,96,23,,,,,,,,,
24499,Kyle,6,Hurray!,17,Southpark,7,1,,,,,,,,,
24506,Cartman,6,Small penis?!,17,Southpark,13,2,,,,,,,,,
24508,Kyle,6,"Please, you have to listen to me! The prophecy actually did come true!",17,Southpark,70,13,,,,,,,,,
24510,Kyle,6,Yes! It did!,17,Southpark,12,3,,,,,,,,,
24512,Kyle,6,"But that is what happened! It is! Tell them, Cartman!",17,Southpark,53,10,,,,,,,,,
24513,Cartman,6,"No, Kyle, you were right. I see now that little lies can cause huge problems.",17,Southpark,77,15,,,,,,,,,
24514,Kyle,6,But it's the truth!,17,Southpark,19,4,,,,,,,,,
24515,Cartman,6,"No, it's not, Kyle. I have a huge dick.",17,Southpark,39,9,,,,,,,,,
24517,Kyle,6,Ssso it was all for nothing. The whole time I was... eating farts for nothing.,17,Southpark,78,15,,,,,,,,,
24518,Cartman,6,"Cheer up, Kyle. I'm sure this isn't the first time someone who thought they were suffering for humanity was actually just sucking farts. Hey. How about we get a little dessert, help cheer you up? ",17,Southpark,196,35,,,,,,,,,
24520,Randy,7,I'm just trying to earn some extra holiday cash.,17,Southpark,48,9,,,,,,,,,
24523,Cartman,7,"Good evening, sir. I'm calling together all the fighters of Zauron. I need to speak with Lady McCormick.",17,Southpark,104,18,,,,,,,,,
24524,Kenny,7,,17,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
24525,Cartman,7,"Please tell her there is to be a meeting in the Great Hall. I have found a way to get XBox Ones, and the fair Lady McCormick will want to hear about it.",17,Southpark,152,33,,,,,,,,,
24526,Cartman,7,"Thank you all for coming. Prince Token, Sir Timmy of Blacklake, Lady McCormickÎ_. Warriors, we have fought many great battles together. At Clyde's house. At Scott Malkinson's house. But soon we will be fighting the greatest battle of our young hot lives. Winter is coming, and the next gen gaming devices are hitting the shelves.",17,Southpark,329,55,,,,,,,,,
24528,Cartman,7,What if I were to tell you that if we all worked together there's a way weÎ_canÎ_get the new gaming system.,17,Southpark,107,21,,,,,,,,,
24530,Cartman,7,"I have learned of a dark magic at work. The day after Thanksgiving, the first thirty people inside the mall get 80% off whatever they want. They are calling it... Black Friday.",17,Southpark,176,32,,,,,,,,,
24531,Butters,7,"Woo, spooky.",17,Southpark,12,2,,,,,,,,,
24533,Cartman,7,"ItÎ_isÎ_real, Craig! I saw it on the news, butthole!",17,Southpark,52,9,,,,,,,,,
24534,Stan,7,ItÎ_isÎ_real. They do it every year. But everyone in town tries to be the first inside the mall on Black Friday. What chance do we have?,17,Southpark,136,26,,,,,,,,,
24535,Cartman,7,"On our own, none. But if we plan, strategize, and fight together!Î_Î_...We can be the first people inside on Black Friday. And use the 80% to get the gaming system we need to survive.",17,Southpark,183,34,,,,,,,,,
24544,Cartman,7,"Yes. Yes, very nice. Good.",17,Southpark,26,5,,,,,,,,,
24545,Butters,7,"Wizard Cartman! I have news from the Internet, my lord!Î_",17,Southpark,57,10,,,,,,,,,
24546,Cartman,7,"They don't salute in Game of Thrones, Butters.",17,Southpark,46,8,,,,,,,,,
24547,Butters,7,"Uh, sorry, I haven't watched it yet.",17,Southpark,36,7,,,,,,,,,
24548,Cartman,7,"Okay, we need to start immediately, please.Î_Î_Ah, very good. The House of Greyhawk has agreed to join our fight!",17,Southpark,113,19,,,,,,,,,
24549,Stan,7,The House of Greyhawk?,17,Southpark,22,4,,,,,,,,,
24550,Kyle,7,Larry and Brad Stoltsky,17,Southpark,23,4,,,,,,,,,
24551,Cartman,7,"But my friends, we must still find others who will fight by our side! Are there no other factions we can call to our aid?",17,Southpark,121,25,,,,,,,,,
24553,Cartman,7,"Uhh noo! Screw those guys. They're dorks, and I'm not playing with them.",17,Southpark,72,13,,,,,,,,,
24554,Randy,7,"Hey,Î_Î_that's what I'm talkin' about. You got any extra of that?Î_Î_Oh, thanks!Î_Î_Gets a little boring around here, you know?Î_",17,Southpark,129,19,,,,,,,,,
24556,Randy,7,So you worked here last winter? You worked on Black Friday?Î_,17,Southpark,61,11,,,,,,,,,
24558,Randy,7,Is it really as bad as they say it is?,17,Southpark,38,10,,,,,,,,,
24560,Butters,7,"Well Wizard Cartman, I started watching Game of Thrones.",17,Southpark,56,9,,,,,,,,,
24561,Cartman,7,"Ah yes, Paladin Butters, are you enjoying it?",17,Southpark,45,8,,,,,,,,,
24562,Butters,7,"Well it's it's pretty good, I guess, but have you ever noticed that almost every time they show a guy's wiener, that guy's character is gay?",17,Southpark,140,26,,,,,,,,,
24563,Cartman,7,What do you mean?,17,Southpark,17,4,,,,,,,,,
24564,Butters,7,"Well ih-it's just that they have a lot of girls' boobs and vagina's and stuff, but most times they show a man's wiener, it's because that guy's in a love scene with another guy. Do you think it's because gay wieners are less threatening to women viewers?",17,Southpark,254,47,,,,,,,,,
24565,Cartman,7,"Iiii believe you might be missing the greater point of the show, Paladin Butters.",17,Southpark,81,14,,,,,,,,,
24566,Butters,7,"Yeah, I know. Winter is comin' and there's dragons and zombies on the way. I'm pretty excited for that. Just could do with a little less gay wiener is all.",17,Southpark,155,30,,,,,,,,,
24567,Cartman,7,We have word from the kindergartners. They've agreed to join us!Î_,17,Southpark,66,11,,,,,,,,,
24568,Kyle,7,Those XBox Ones are as good as ours!,17,Southpark,36,8,,,,,,,,,
24571,Cartman,7,"That's what this is all about, Craig. We're all trying to get XBox Ones on Black Friday.",17,Southpark,88,17,,,,,,,,,
24573,Cartman,7,What?,17,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
24575,Cartman,7,"...Nnnoo. Guys, when I said we're gonna get the next gen gaming systems, I was obviously talking about XBoxes.",17,Southpark,110,19,,,,,,,,,
24576,Kyle,7,Yeah.,17,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
24578,Kyle,7,"Look, guys, we all have to agree on one system.",17,Southpark,47,10,,,,,,,,,
24579,Cartman,7,That's right.,17,Southpark,13,2,,,,,,,,,
24580,Kyle,7,"If some of us are on PS4s, but the rest of us are on XBox's, then we all can't play together online. See? This is all about committing to one machine.",17,Southpark,150,31,,,,,,,,,
24582,Kyle,7,"No, the XBox's are gonna be better.",17,Southpark,35,7,,,,,,,,,
24584,Cartman,7,"We are getting XBox Ones, guys! And that is final!",17,Southpark,50,10,,,,,,,,,
24587,Cartman,7,"Fine! If you guys don't wanna join us on Black Friday to get XBoxes, then that's fine!",17,Southpark,86,17,,,,,,,,,
24589,Cartman,7,"Oh, it's gonna be like that, is it?!",17,Southpark,36,8,,,,,,,,,
24591,Kyle,7,"No! We can't divide like this!Î_Î_Stan?Î_Î_You're on our side, right?",17,Southpark,69,10,,,,,,,,,
24592,Stan,7,I like the PS4's controller better.,17,Southpark,35,6,,,,,,,,,
24593,Kyle,7,"Stan, the PS4 doesn't have the seamless transition between games, movies, and TV offered by XBox One.",17,Southpark,101,17,,,,,,,,,
24594,Stan,7,"The PS4 has a touchpad interface. You never listened. I told you I thought the PS4 was better, but you never wanted to listen to me, Kyle. You just had your head so set because...Î_Î_because that's how XBox people are.",17,Southpark,218,40,,,,,,,,,
24595,Kyle,7,Then I guess I'll see you on Black Friday.,17,Southpark,42,9,,,,,,,,,
24596,Stan,7,"If I see you at the mall, Kyle, I will have to try to beat you inside.",17,Southpark,70,17,,,,,,,,,
24597,Kyle,7,I know.,17,Southpark,7,2,,,,,,,,,
24598,Cartman,7,"Come on, Kyle. Let these Sony fucks wallow in their limited voice-control functionality.Î_",17,Southpark,90,13,,,,,,,,,

24603,Randy,7,"I did, Sharon.Î_Î_I saw they were hiring extra security, and I thought it'd be a good way to make money.",17,Southpark,104,20,,,,,,,,,
24605,Randy,7,"Nobody else has thought of it, Sharon. I won't even be out in the crowd. I'll be on the inside when the doors open. While everyone is trying to run over each other, I'll turn around and run right into the stores. I'll be the first to get whatever I want!",17,Southpark,254,51,,,,,,,,,
24607,Randy,7,"Winter is coming, Sharon, and I'm a sneaky little bee.Î_Î_Bzzz bzzz.Î_",17,Southpark,70,11,,,,,,,,,
24612,Cartman,7,"Oh uh, hey guys, what's up?",17,Southpark,27,6,,,,,,,,,
24614,Cartman,7,God these guys are such dorks!,17,Southpark,30,6,,,,,,,,,
24616,Cartman,7,"Uh yeah, big dong and prosper. Um, listen guys, uh, uh, you're XBox people, right?",17,Southpark,82,15,,,,,,,,,
24618,Cartman,7,"Oh my god they're so gaaay!Î_Î_Um, kewl. What if I were to tell you that we have a way for you to join us in getting XBox Ones super cheap.",17,Southpark,139,30,,,,,,,,,
24620,Cartman,7,"The Federation has agreed to fight with us!Î_Î_With them and the kindergartners, our army has just doubled in size!Î_Î_You still think you can convince Stan to come back to our side, don't you, Sir Kyle?",17,Southpark,203,35,,,,,,,,,
24621,Kyle,7,I don't know.,17,Southpark,13,3,,,,,,,,,
24622,Cartman,7,"You can't change his mind, Sir Kyle. Sony people don't think with logic. He betrayed us. And now we must out-Game of ThronesÎ_him by making powerful alliances.",17,Southpark,159,27,,,,,,,,,
24623,Butters,7,"Oh don't even get me started! I keep watchin' that show and I'm waitin' for the darn dragon to show up and, and kick everyone's butt! But all I get is wiener, wiener, wiener. It's not all gay wiener, but when they DO show a straight guy's wiener, it's all soft and floppy. Even though he just got done humpin' a pretty girl! Why is that? Because a soft wiener isn't threatening, just like a gay wiener.Î_",17,Southpark,404,77,,,,,,,,,
24624,Cartman,7,"Butters, you seem to be somewhat obsessed with wieners.",17,Southpark,55,9,,,,,,,,,
24625,Butters,7,I'm obsessed with wieners? Well what about HBO?,17,Southpark,47,8,,,,,,,,,
24626,Kyle,7,"This isn't helping us, Butters!",17,Southpark,31,5,,,,,,,,,

24639,Randy,7,"Morning, Joe, Marcus.",17,Southpark,21,3,,,,,,,,,
24642,Randy,7,What is it?,17,Southpark,11,3,,,,,,,,,
24655,Stan,7,"We come seeking your help. Do you side with those wanting XBoxe's, or will you join us on Black Friday and fight for PS4s?",17,Southpark,122,24,,,,,,,,,
24659,Stan,7,Then join us! We need people to help us be the first 20 inside the mall!,17,Southpark,72,16,,,,,,,,,
24661,Stan,7,"No, you can't do that!",17,Southpark,22,5,,,,,,,,,
24663,Stan,7,"Don't you see this is about more than Black Friday? Battle lines are being drawn! If you wait it out, but everyone else has already decided to go with XBox, then, that will become the standard! The PS4 would be like Betamax was to VHS.",17,Southpark,235,45,,,,,,,,,
24665,Stan,7,Exactly!,17,Southpark,8,1,,,,,,,,,
24667,Stan,7,"...Look, we're just asking people who want to play on PS4s to fight for what they believe in!",17,Southpark,93,18,,,,,,,,,

24674,Cartman,7,"True, but we can't let Kyle come in the way of what's rightfully ours.Î_Î_Let's face it, Lady McCormick, this is really about you and me getting XBox Ones. The others are simply there to... help us get inside those doors.",17,Southpark,221,40,,,,,,,,,
24675,Kenny,7,Î_,17,Southpark,2,1,,,,,,,,,
24676,Cartman,7,"You have a strong influence over the rest of the men, Lady McCormick. All I'm saying is when the time comes, I might need you to... use that influence to have Kyle taken care of. Do we understand each other?",17,Southpark,207,40,,,,,,,,,

24695,Stan,7,Did you ask the Vamp kids?,17,Southpark,26,6,,,,,,,,,
24697,Stan,7,There has to be a way to get people on the fence to join our side.Î_,17,Southpark,68,16,,,,,,,,,
24701,Stan,7,So we're just gonna let other kids decide which game system we all play on? What would they do on Game of Thrones? What would they do when things look their darkest?,17,Southpark,165,32,,,,,,,,,
24709,Cartman,7,"Yes. Good, Federation kids. You're learning to fight with your hands! Keep pushing, kindergartners!Î_Î_Sir Kyle, I know that Sony's offering a special Brack Friday Bunduru. You know the XBox is still better, right?",17,Southpark,214,33,,,,,,,,,
24710,Kyle,7,"Yeah, but, why can't XBox automatically let you pre-order Metal Gear Solid V?",17,Southpark,77,13,,,,,,,,,
24711,Cartman,7,"Sir Kyle, pre-order doesn't mean shit, okay? When you pre-order a game, you're just committing to paying for something that some assholes in California haven't even finished working on yet. You know what you get for pre-ordering a game? A big dick in your mouth.",17,Southpark,262,45,,,,,,,,,
24712,Randy,7,"Alright, listen up.Î_Î_The mall is no longer allowing people to line up for Black Friday until Thanksgiving night.Î_Î_It's okay. To hold places in line we're handing out wristbands.Î_Î_Augh! Hold on! Oh God!",17,Southpark,207,32,,,,,,,,,
24718,Randy,7,No!Î_,17,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
24720,Randy,7,No! You can't die! Everybody really likes you!,17,Southpark,46,8,,,,,,,,,
24722,Randy,7,"No, I was lying to you! I took this job... to be at the front of the line on Black Friday.",17,Southpark,90,21,,,,,,,,,
24724,Randy,7,Get back inside. We have work to do.Î_,17,Southpark,38,8,,,,,,,,,
24725,Stan,7,"When we started this fight... it was because we were tired of XBox people telling us Playstation sucks! Now... we have an army of our own!Î_Î_I can't guarantee you will live, but I can guarantee that before this is over... the winner of the console wars will be decided.Î_Î_Our new leader has joined us to help make sure that system is the PS4!Î_All hail the Princess!Î_",17,Southpark,370,66,,,,,,,,,
24727,Kenny,8,"Previously, on South Park.",17,Southpark,26,4,,,,,,,,,
24732,Cartman,8,"Alright, stop, stop, stop!Î_Î_This is NOT how you fight! You think this is a joke?! On Black Friday, there's gonna be thousands of shoppers trying to get inside that mall keeping you from getting Xbox Ones! So what do we do?! We survey each enemy, and we attack their weak spots! Scott Malkinson has diabetes, so we hit him in his weak spot!Î_",17,Southpark,343,63,,,,,,,,,
24734,Cartman,8,"There's another army out there who thinks they're better than us, and we are not going to be beat by that traitor whore Kenny! Get back to training!Î_",17,Southpark,150,28,,,,,,,,,
24735,Butters,8,Yeah!,17,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
24737,Kyle,8,"Cartman, we should probably talk about our chances.",17,Southpark,51,8,,,,,,,,,
24738,Cartman,8,"The men are just inexperience, Sir Kyle. They need more training.",17,Southpark,65,11,,,,,,,,,
24739,Kyle,8,"It's not enough! Ever since Kenny switched sides, there are more kids that wanna go with PS4 on Black Friday.",17,Southpark,109,20,,,,,,,,,
24740,Cartman,8,"That Goddamn traitor! You know why Kenny's doing this, right? Because he wanted to be a princess, and I wouldn't let him!Î_Î_I said, ""You can be a chick, Kenny, but there's only one ruler, and that's me!""Î_",17,Southpark,206,37,,,,,,,,,
24741,Kyle,8,Cartman released the PS4s Cartman. They're being reviewed. People are liking them.,17,Southpark,82,12,,,,,,,,,
24742,Cartman,8,"I guarantee you Kenny had something to do with Sony offering a Brack Friday Bunduru!Î_Î_Just keep them in training, Sir Kyle. Two can play at Kenny's backstabbing game.Î_",17,Southpark,170,28,,,,,,,,,
24743,Cartman,8,"Stupid asshole!Î_Î_Yes, hello. I'd like to speak to the president of XBox, please... The president of XBox, like, the head of XBox... Fine, CEO of Microsoft, whatever. Put him on. I need help blowing up PlayStation people... Eric Cartman. I'm a wizard and a king... A wizard-king, yes... No, I'm not king of wizards, I'm a king that happens to be a wizard.Î_Î_Just put the CEO of Microsoft on the phone!",17,Southpark,403,71,,,,,,,,,
24759,Randy,8,Happy was a good man. Too good to have died in such a brutal but festive manner.,17,Southpark,80,17,,,,,,,,,
24766,Randy,8,Everybody stay put! I'll handle this.Î_,17,Southpark,39,6,,,,,,,,,
24767,Randy,8,"If you are here for Black Friday, you cannot be on mall property until midnight on Thanksgiving.",17,Southpark,96,17,,,,,,,,,
24769,Randy,8,"Well, you're about to be.",17,Southpark,25,5,,,,,,,,,
24771,Randy,8,You're gonna have to walk slower than that. You've got a while.,17,Southpark,63,12,,,,,,,,,
24773,Randy,8,Smartasses.Î_,17,Southpark,13,1,,,,,,,,,
24774,Cartman,8,"Paladin Butters, I was hoping I could talk to you about Lady McCormick",17,Southpark,70,13,,,,,,,,,
24775,Butters,8,"You mean Princess Kenny, m'lord?",17,Southpark,32,5,,,,,,,,,
24776,Cartman,8,"Yeah, whatever. The little prick thinks he's Daenerys Targaryen. I need to know how to deal with him.Î_Î_How do they deal with the Queen of Dragons inÎ_Game of Thrones?",17,Southpark,168,29,,,,,,,,,
24777,Butters,8,They don't!,17,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
24778,Cartman,8,Well did you finish watching Season 3 like I asked you?,17,Southpark,55,11,,,,,,,,,
24779,Butters,8,"Yeah, I finished it!",17,Southpark,20,4,,,,,,,,,
24780,Cartman,8,So what happens when the dragons show up?,17,Southpark,41,8,,,,,,,,,
24781,Butters,8,"Nothing! The dragons are just still on their way! They keep promising dragons, but all I get are more floppy wieners in my face!",17,Southpark,128,24,,,,,,,,,
24782,Cartman,8,Butter-Butters! The key to our victory is following theÎ_Game of ThronesÎ_model exactly. I have to know what happens when the dragons show up so I know how to deal with Kenny.,17,Southpark,175,31,,,,,,,,,
24783,Butters,8,Wha-what do you wantÎ_meÎ_to do?,17,Southpark,32,5,,,,,,,,,
24784,Cartman,8,Here's two bus tickets to New Mexico. I want you to take Sir Scott Malkinson and go seek out George R. R. Martin for answers.,17,Southpark,125,25,,,,,,,,,
24785,Butters,8,Who's George R. R. Martin?,17,Southpark,26,5,,,,,,,,,
24786,Cartman,8,"He's the guy who writesÎ_Game of Thrones, Butters! He can let us both know how to handle Kenny, and if we should betray Clyde or not. Let's face it, Butters, this is really about you and me getting XBoxes. The rest are simply there to help us get through those doors.",17,Southpark,267,51,,,,,,,,,
24788,Cartman,8,Do you mind?! We're trying to talk here!,17,Southpark,40,8,,,,,,,,,
24790,Cartman,8,Why don't you mind your own business?!,17,Southpark,38,7,,,,,,,,,
24803,Butters,8,"Well come on, Scott. You're lagging.",17,Southpark,36,6,,,,,,,,,
24805,Butters,8,"Let's just talk to this guy, and then we can hit a McDonald's. Oh here we go. 2217.Î_",17,Southpark,85,18,,,,,,,,,
24807,Butters,8,Hello? Is this George R. R. Martin's house?,17,Southpark,43,8,,,,,,,,,
24809,Butters,8,"Uhhhh, it's two kids who want to know what happens when the dragons show up?Î_Î_Hello?",17,Southpark,86,15,,,,,,,,,
24811,Butters,8,We're not fans!,17,Southpark,15,3,,,,,,,,,
24813,Butters,8,"We don't like it! And I'm pretty pissed off, if you wanna know the truth!",17,Southpark,73,15,,,,,,,,,
24815,Butters,8,"Let me talk to George R. R. Martin, and I'll tell him about what!Î_",17,Southpark,67,14,,,,,,,,,
24817,Butters,8,"Uh no sir, we just really need to know about the dragons, but they never seem to show up.",17,Southpark,89,19,,,,,,,,,
24819,Butters,8,When?,17,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
24821,Butters,8,Please. It's urgent.,17,Southpark,20,3,,,,,,,,,
24823,Butters,8,"No, uhno, can we skip the wiener stuff and just get to the dragons?",17,Southpark,67,14,,,,,,,,,
24825,Butters,8,"Uh what's the matter, Scott?",17,Southpark,28,5,,,,,,,,,
24827,Butters,8,He's diabetic.,17,Southpark,14,2,,,,,,,,,
24829,Butters,8,"Oh. Okay, thanks.",17,Southpark,17,3,,,,,,,,,
24831,Cartman,8,"Sir Kyle, I wanted to talk to you about Stan.",17,Southpark,45,10,,,,,,,,,
24832,Kyle,8,"If you want to make sure I'm not switching sides, Cartman, you don't have to worry. Stan is wrong.",17,Southpark,98,19,,,,,,,,,
24833,Cartman,8,"It isn't that. Princess Kenny is loved by her armyÎ_, but Stan is still the nuts and ball of her operation.Î_Î_It would be a huge setback to the traitors getting their PlayStations if Stan were to be...Î_Î_grounded?",17,Southpark,215,37,,,,,,,,,
24834,Kyle,8,Grounded? For what?,17,Southpark,19,3,,,,,,,,,
24835,Cartman,8,That could be up to you.,17,Southpark,24,6,,,,,,,,,
24836,Kyle,8,"No, Cartman. You said nobody will have to be grounded. We're not playing dirty!",17,Southpark,79,14,,,,,,,,,
24837,Cartman,8,"Fine, Sir Kyle. Perhaps you're right.Î_Î_Did you know that Stan's dad is working a temp job as mall security?",17,Southpark,109,19,,,,,,,,,
24838,Kyle,8,What?,17,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
24839,Cartman,8,"Seems a little convenient, doesn't it?Î_Î_Stan with somebody on the inside to help him get his PS4s. Who's playing dirty now? Let's face it, Sir Kyle, this is really about you and me getting XBoxes. The rest are simply there to help us get through those doors.",17,Southpark,260,47,,,,,,,,,
24841,Cartman,8,"Dude, you'd better stop harassing me or I'm callin' the cops!",17,Southpark,61,11,,,,,,,,,
24843,Cartman,8,Yeah!,17,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
24845,Cartman,8,Well go ahead! Call the fuckin' cops then!,17,Southpark,42,8,,,,,,,,,
24862,Cartman,8,"Hi, is Kenny home?",17,Southpark,18,4,,,,,,,,,
24864,Cartman,8,"Forward, men!Î_Î_That, no-Î_Î_No, you- You've gotta turn me.Î_",17,Southpark,62,8,,,,,,,,,
24867,Cartman,8,"I seek audience with the traitor, Lady McCormick?",17,Southpark,49,8,,,,,,,,,
24868,Stan,8,Let them pass!Î_Î_,17,Southpark,18,3,,,,,,,,,
24869,Kenny,8,,17,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
24870,Stan,8,The Princess bids your fat ass welcome to her kingdom and suggests you state your purpose.,17,Southpark,90,16,,,,,,,,,
24871,Cartman,8,"You can't win this, guys. Look around you. Lay down your weapons, and you can come back and fight for XBoxes with us on Black Friday.",17,Southpark,133,26,,,,,,,,,
24872,Kenny,8,,17,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
24873,Stan,8,"The Princess says that if you wanna change your mind and agree that Playstations are better, she'll consider it.",17,Southpark,112,19,,,,,,,,,
24874,Cartman,8,"Kenny, we all understand wanting to play as the chick once in a while, 'kay? But you are never going to be a real princess!",17,Southpark,123,25,,,,,,,,,
24875,Kenny,8,Î_ ,17,Southpark,3,1,,,,,,,,,
24876,Stan,8,The Princess calls you a ball-licking lesbian.,17,Southpark,46,7,,,,,,,,,
24877,Cartman,8,That doesn't even make sense.,17,Southpark,29,5,,,,,,,,,
24878,Kyle,8,"Stan, this has gone too far. People are going to get hurt. What you started is way out of control.",17,Southpark,98,20,,,,,,,,,
24879,Stan,8,WhatÎ_IÎ_started? How dare you!,17,Southpark,31,4,,,,,,,,,
24880,Kyle,8,All these people are going to be gaming on XBox. You really wanna just game with Craig the rest of your life?,17,Southpark,109,22,,,,,,,,,
24881,Stan,8,"I would rather game with Craig than spend one minute having to set up an XBox Live account! We will get our PlayStations tomorrow, and you buttholes will have nothing!",17,Southpark,167,30,,,,,,,,,
24882,Cartman,8,"You're outnumbered ten to one, and there's no time left! How will you win?!Î_",17,Southpark,77,14,,,,,,,,,

24892,Cartman,8,"Mr. Gates, I was hoping I could talk to you about the fight on Friday.",17,Southpark,70,15,,,,,,,,,
24894,Cartman,8,"Uhh, it's my Lord Wizard King, actually. Having your leadership has certainly been a help.Î_Î_But I hope that we're clear that this is my army.Î_Î_There can only be one person of royalty; that's kind of the rules.",17,Southpark,213,37,,,,,,,,,
24896,Cartman,8,Your CEOs?,17,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,

24900,Cartman,8,Why don't you stay the fuck out of my business?!,17,Southpark,48,10,,,,,,,,,

24963,Kyle,9,"Cartman, he's got everyone on Sony's side. We can't stop him!",17,Southpark,61,11,,,,,,,,,

24966,Cartman,9,"Tell Bill Gates to suck my ass, Mom!Î_Î_Mom?Î_Î_Don't seriously tell Bill Gates to suck my ass. Tell him everything's cool and I'll call him in a little bit.Î_",17,Southpark,159,28,,,,,,,,,
24967,Kyle,9,This would have never happened if you would have let Kenny be a princess in the first place!,17,Southpark,92,18,,,,,,,,,
24968,Cartman,9,"He's not a princess, he's a DUDE!",17,Southpark,33,7,,,,,,,,,
24969,Kyle,9,"Well, unfortunately for us, he's now on the other side! We are out of options!",17,Southpark,78,15,,,,,,,,,
24970,Cartman,9,"So what are you saying, Kyle?!",17,Southpark,30,6,,,,,,,,,
24971,Kyle,9,"I have an idea.Î_Î_I don't like it, but I think it's the only choice we have.",17,Southpark,77,16,,,,,,,,,
24979,Stan,9,"Alright, guys, here's the deal: the main entrance to the mall is already blocked by thousands of waiting shoppers. The kids who want XBoxes plan to flank from the left, here.Î_Î_Our best chance of being first inside is finding a way to the mall's back entrance, here.Î_",17,Southpark,269,47,,,,,,,,,
24982,Stan,9,The key to us being the first ones inside is taking over the Red Robin before Black Friday starts.,17,Southpark,98,19,,,,,,,,,

24990,Cartman,9,"Alright. on behalf of the XBox fighters of Zaron we hereby lay down our arms and give up, okay?",17,Southpark,95,19,,,,,,,,,
24992,Cartman,9,"Shut up, Craig! This is very difficult! You guys win, alright?! We'll all play on PlayStation 4s! We still think XBox is the superior machine, but you got too many people on your side, and then Kenny became a Japanese princess.",17,Southpark,227,41,,,,,,,,,
24994,Kyle,9,"Look, the truth is, we all have a bigger problem now, and you know it. Nobody is going to get anything if we don't work together against those thousands of other shoppers.",17,Southpark,171,32,,,,,,,,,
24995,Stan,9,"So, better a PS4 than nothing, is that it? I think we'll take our chances on our own.Î_",17,Southpark,87,18,,,,,,,,,
24996,Cartman,9,"We know a way inside the Red Robin.Î_Î_You don't think you're the only ones that thought of it. We were going to use the Red Robin entrance too, and we figured out how.",17,Southpark,168,33,,,,,,,,,
24997,Kyle,9,"Red Robin can be rented out, for wedding parties. If we all chip in we can pay for the deposit to have the wedding party there.",17,Southpark,127,26,,,,,,,,,
24999,Kyle,9,"Let's do this together, dude.Î_Î_Our only shot at playing any next-gen console is by teaming up. If you wanna game on a PS4, then I do too.",17,Southpark,139,27,,,,,,,,,
25000,Stan,9,And you swear you'll be okay with that? You won't talk about the XBox being better ever again?,17,Southpark,94,18,,,,,,,,,

25027,Stan,9,Why?,17,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
25028,Cartman,9,"Well, think about it.Î_Î_The first people inside are gonna have to take on the brunt of the holiday shoppers from the main entrance. It's best we let Butters and Scott Malkinson go first. While they fight, we can simply slip on by.",17,Southpark,231,42,,,,,,,,,
25029,Stan,9,"Oh, okay I guess that makes sense, but... Butters and Scott won't be able to get their PS4s.",17,Southpark,92,18,,,,,,,,,

25742,Kyle,1,That's the NFL!,18,Southpark,15,3,,,,,,,,,
25743,Cartman,1,"It's the same thing, Kyle! The point is, if we as an organization claim to be about high morality, somebody is eventually going to get raped or beaten in an elevator and it's most likely going to be Butters.",18,Southpark,207,39,,,,,,,,,
25744,Butters,1,Oh no!,18,Southpark,6,2,,,,,,,,,

25780,Cartman,1,"Fuck youuuu, fuck youuuu. Fuck you up there! Fuck you! ""Fuck you."" Those words mean a great deal to us. They help us express just how we as a company... see things differently. There are a lot of startup companies on Kickstarter, but after today I think you'll agree that Washington Redskins is the most exciting. As you know, the Redskins have been on the forefront of Kickstarter as a company that is always finding new and exciting ways to tell people to go fuck themselves. And now, our company is thrilled to show you all the latest innovations we've come up with.  To begin with, we have moved the couch from the left side of the office to the right side. But we didn't stop there. We also added a new rug that goes better with our office drapes. And probably most exciting of all, we have actually updated the company from the inside out. We received a lot of pressure from certain communities to change our Redskins logo. As a company we want to be firm, but we also want to be flexible. And so we thought, if we have to change our logo, it should be more in step with today's times, but still define us as the leading Kickstarter company. What we came up with is the new company logo that I think you'll all agree is very exciting.  Now when people hear the name ""Redskins"", they will immediately think ""titties"" and ""balls"". It's just a bold new way that we can say ""We don't fucking care."" Go Redskins! ",18,Southpark,1414,263,,,,,,,,,

25785,Kyle,1,"Give it time, it'll grow on you.",18,Southpark,32,7,,,,,,,,,
25786,Stan,1,"Why don't we just call it ""Untitled Startup Company""?",18,Southpark,53,9,,,,,,,,,
25787,Kyle,1,"Because that sounds like we don't have anything, We've been through this already, Stan!",18,Southpark,87,14,,,,,,,,,
25788,Stan,1,"Yeah, I know that. But a good company should never have seven words in its title.",18,Southpark,81,16,,,,,,,,,
25789,Kyle,1,Well whattaya mean?,18,Southpark,19,3,,,,,,,,,
25790,Stan,1,"I just feel that somewhere out there, there's a perfect startup company name. And I need to be free to go find it.",18,Southpark,114,23,,,,,,,,,
25791,Kyle,1,"Oh. Well, I certainly don't want you to feel that ""Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly on the Table"" is holding you back. ",18,Southpark,117,21,,,,,,,,,

25801,Butters,1,Happy Deadline Day!,18,Southpark,19,3,,,,,,,,,
25802,Cartman,1,"We made it, guys. We cab finally stop doing stuff and see just how much our company made in 4, 3, 2, 1 that's the deadline!",18,Southpark,123,26,,,,,,,,,
25803,Butters,1,"Oh boy, this is like Christmas morning!",18,Southpark,39,7,,,,,,,,,
25804,Cartman,1,"What the hell? Can't find the server?  Kickstarter.com!  Kickstarter. Where is Kickstarter?! Get it up on the phone, Butters. Come on, I wanna know how much our company is worth!",18,Southpark,178,30,,,,,,,,,
25805,Butters,1,It's not coming up on my phone either. I... Holy Mother Mary!,18,Southpark,61,12,,,,,,,,,
25806,Kenny,1,,18,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
25807,Butters,1,Somebody raided Kickstarter and they burned the building to the ground!,18,Southpark,71,11,,,,,,,,,
25808,Cartman,1,What?!,18,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
25809,Butters,1,Somebody killed Kickstarter!,18,Southpark,28,3,,,,,,,,,
25810,Cartman,1,Who the hell would burn Kickstarter to the ground?!  Oh my God! That weird little Jewy guy! Kyle!,18,Southpark,97,18,,,,,,,,,
25811,Kyle,1,"What the hell is wrong? ""Can't find the server"" Kickstarter. ",18,Southpark,61,10,,,,,,,,,
25812,Cartman,1,You song of a bitch!,18,Southpark,20,5,,,,,,,,,
25813,Kyle,1,What?!,18,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
25814,Cartman,1,You broke Kickstarter!,18,Southpark,22,3,,,,,,,,,
25815,Kyle,1,"No, I just can't get it to load.",18,Southpark,32,8,,,,,,,,,
25816,Cartman,1,Nobody can! It's gone! You just couldn't take it that our company was more successful than yours would ever be!,18,Southpark,111,20,,,,,,,,,
25817,Kyle,1,My company was on Kickstarter too! Why would I get rid of it?!,18,Southpark,62,13,,,,,,,,,
25818,Cartman,1,"Well, somebody did!",18,Southpark,19,3,,,,,,,,,
25819,Stan,1,"It doesn't matter, you guys. There's something a lot more important here.  Do you guys remember when we first decided to start a company together? We all had a common goal. And we weren't gonna let anything stop us from getting to the bro down. But somewhere between starting up and selling out we... we lost our way. We can't do this on our own. We need each other.",18,Southpark,366,69,,,,,,,,,
25820,Kyle,1,He's right. We should do a merger.,18,Southpark,34,7,,,,,,,,,
25821,Cartman,1,"A merger?! It's too late for that, you guys! Kickstarter is gone! We don't have a company! We don't have anything! ",18,Southpark,115,21,,,,,,,,,
25822,Kyle,1,"Yes we do! We have a sweet name.  I was wrong, Cartman. ""Washington Redskins"" is the perfect name. I think maybe I was jealous that I didn't come up with it.",18,Southpark,157,31,,,,,,,,,
25823,Cartman,1,It is really sweet.,18,Southpark,19,4,,,,,,,,,
25824,Stan,1,"And we always said that all we needed was a sweet name and the rest would figure itself out,",18,Southpark,92,19,,,,,,,,,
25825,Butters,1,"Yeah, we can do it, fellas! It'll be like old times!",18,Southpark,52,11,,,,,,,,,
25826,Kyle,1,"Whattaya say, Cartman?",18,Southpark,22,3,,,,,,,,,
25827,Cartman,1,"Fuck you! Fuck you, everyone. Yes, fuck you all, thanks!  How do you stay relevant in a volatile marketplace? As you know, our goal at Washington Redskins is to not do anything, and make money not doing it.",18,Southpark,206,38,,,,,,,,,
25828,Kyle,1,"When Kickstarter went down, many saw their startup projects die, but here at Washington Redskins, we saw opportunity. People still need a way to raise money for their stupid startup projects, and with the Redskins you can now go fund yourself.  And the idea is simple. You, the people, go out and raise all your own money, and give the Washington Redskins 5%.",18,Southpark,359,63,,,,,,,,,
25829,Cartman,1,"You will literally be giving us money for doing absolutely nothing. It is the biggest ""fuck you"" we have ever come up with. But we didn't stop there, because a new company direction also means, of course, a new and improved logo. ",18,Southpark,230,42,,,,,,,,,
25851,Stan,1,"Boy, this is the life, huh guys?",18,Southpark,32,7,,,,,,,,,
25852,Butters,1,We finally did it!,18,Southpark,18,4,,,,,,,,,
25853,Cartman,1,I just might sit here until my ass fuses into the couch. ,18,Southpark,57,12,,,,,,,,,
25854,Kyle,1,What the heck is that? ,18,Southpark,23,5,,,,,,,,,
25855,Cartman,1,"Whoa, whoa! What?",18,Southpark,17,3,,,,,,,,,
25858,Kyle,1,Change our name?,18,Southpark,16,3,,,,,,,,,
25859,Stan,1,But you all thought our name was sweet.,18,Southpark,39,8,,,,,,,,,
25861,Kyle,1,When was that?,18,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,
25867,Kyle,1,Well what the hell do we do?,18,Southpark,28,7,,,,,,,,,
25868,Cartman,1,I guess we gotta go back to school. ,18,Southpark,36,8,,,,,,,,,
25869,Kyle,2,Hey guys!,18,Southpark,9,2,,,,,,,,,
25870,Stan,2,Morning!,18,Southpark,8,1,,,,,,,,,

25886,Stan,2,"Yeah, the startup company thing didn't work out.",18,Southpark,48,8,,,,,,,,,
25888,Stan,2,"So hey, I was gonna see if you still wanted to see that stupid Maze Runner movie.",18,Southpark,81,17,,,,,,,,,
25890,Stan,2,"Wendy, I thought my life was going in a different direction and I just felt that I, I really had to give it everything I had, you know. I had I had to focus on one thing.",18,Southpark,170,37,,,,,,,,,
25892,Stan,2,Huh? Why does everyone suddenly remember everything everybody says? ,18,Southpark,68,9,,,,,,,,,
25894,Cartman,2,"Dude, people are pissed off at us.",18,Southpark,34,7,,,,,,,,,
25895,Kenny,2,,18,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
25896,Kyle,2,"Doesn't anyone understand the significance of ""I'm sorry"" anymore?",18,Southpark,66,9,,,,,,,,,
25897,Cartman,2,"Yeah! Well said, Kyle! Good point! What, what happened to the significance?",18,Southpark,75,12,,,,,,,,,
25898,Kyle,2,"Well, I guess let's just be thankful we're not Butters. They won't even let him come back to school.",18,Southpark,100,19,,,,,,,,,
25902,Mr. Garrison,2,"Yeah, all he's gonna talk about is how he's gluten-free now and feels sooo fuckin' amazing.",18,Southpark,91,16,,,,,,,,,
25906,Mr. Garrison,2,It's just the new diet fad! ,18,Southpark,28,6,,,,,,,,,
25910,Mr. Garrison,2,"Can we discuss the gymnasium and get out of here, please?",18,Southpark,57,11,,,,,,,,,
25915,Mr. Garrison,2,I seriously cannot take hearing about gluten anymore.,18,Southpark,53,8,,,,,,,,,
25918,Mr. Garrison,2,"Oh, no, don't try- oh God, here we go.",18,Southpark,38,9,,,,,,,,,
25919,Kyle,2,I don't know what we're going to do? It's been like four hours and people still won't talk to us.,18,Southpark,97,20,,,,,,,,,
25920,Kenny,2,,18,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
25921,Cartman,2,"You know what we gotta do, guys?  We've gotta throw a big fuckin' party",18,Southpark,71,14,,,,,,,,,

25928,Stan,2,For someone that we love who needs us and that we refuse to bail on!,18,Southpark,68,15,,,,,,,,,
25929,Cartman,2,What?,18,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
25930,Kyle,2,"No no, he's right! We've gotta make it for someone in need so that people have to go.",18,Southpark,85,18,,,,,,,,,
25931,Cartman,2,We lure people in with a cause and then hit 'em over the head with the best party ever. We're gonna have pizza and cake and a sweet band!,18,Southpark,137,29,,,,,,,,,
25932,Kyle,2,"A band! Holy shit, Stan! Didn't you say your dad knows somebody who knows Lorde?",18,Southpark,80,15,,,,,,,,,

26300,Cartman,3,Because I don't want a chick watching me go poo!,18,Southpark,48,10,,,,,,,,,
26302,Cartman,3,"No! I identify as a chick, but I'm still a boy. You can't make me share a bathroom with a girl that identifies herself as a fucking dude!  That is MY waterfall, and those are MY Christmas lights!",18,Southpark,195,38,,,,,,,,,

26315,Stan,3,...What?,18,Southpark,8,1,,,,,,,,,
26316,Randy,3,"It started off so simple. There's a guy at work. Hanson. He would use the bathroom and just blow the thing up, you know? Not only that, but he was in there all the time! I finally got fed up and pretended to be a woman. I called myself Lorde. Have you ever been in a woman's bathroom, Stan? It's all clean and there's enough stalls for everyone. It was so freeing. I started singing while I was in there, and then I- started writing things down.",18,Southpark,445,87,,,,,,,,,

26321,Stan,3,"Wha-wait, Lorde sounds like a girl.",18,Southpark,35,6,,,,,,,,,
26322,Randy,3,"Autotune. Wanna see how I do it?  I come up with all my best stuff in the bathroom at work. I use this program to import the recordings I make on my phone.

26323,Stan,3,"Dad, Lorde's music is actually really good.",18,Southpark,43,7,,,,,,,,,
26324,Randy,3,"Thanks. But it gets even better when I add the drum loops.  Then with the computer I can actually quantize everything.  Backup instruments.  And then finally I use the Autotune.

26699,Butters,5,WHY?!,18,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
26700,Cartman,5,"Because Stan saw the video on my phone, alright? If the video is only on my phone, then clearly we did it! If we downloaded it off the Internet, then anyone could have done it!",18,Southpark,176,35,,,,,,,,,
26701,Butters,5,I should have never listened to you! Ah I should have known this would get out of hand!,18,Southpark,87,18,,,,,,,,,

26764,Butters,5,Why?!,18,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
26765,Cartman,5,"Because when Kyle said he heard us say we made the video, we can say we were talking about THIS video. ""Ohh, thank you Eric, that's pretty smart. I really owe you one.""",18,Southpark,168,33,,,,,,,,,
26766,Butters,5,That poor lady. Her vagina is everywhere. Poor Craig.,18,Southpark,53,9,,,,,,,,,
26767,Cartman,5,"Butters, we live in a world where privacy is gone. Okay? It's... It' just gone, bud. Your wiener, my balls, they're public domain.

27270,Kyle,7,"Because I saw you. Okay? In your room, passed out, with a VR headset on. Customer Service said that one of us needed to put on the headset and come get you, and that's why I'm here.",18,Southpark,181,37,,,,,,,,,
27271,Cartman,7,Mmmhmm.,18,Southpark,7,1,,,,,,,,,
27272,Kyle,7,"I know it's hard to believe, but you have to trust me.",18,Southpark,54,12,,,,,,,,,
27273,Cartman,7,"And why did the guys send you, Kyle?",18,Southpark,36,8,,,,,,,,,
27274,Kyle,7,Www-what do you mean?,18,Southpark,21,4,,,,,,,,,
27275,Cartman,7,"Kyle, I want you to brace yourself. This is going to be extremely hard to believe, but you are the one that has been in a coma with a VR headset on.",18,Southpark,148,32,,,,,,,,,
27276,Kyle,7,Fuck you!,18,Southpark,9,2,,,,,,,,,
27277,Cartman,7,"I know it's hard to grasp, Kyle, but I was the one sent by customer service to try and convince you that none of what you've seen is real. You bought the Oculus Rift headset, Kyle.",18,Southpark,180,36,,,,,,,,,
27278,Kyle,7,Don't... do that!,18,Southpark,17,3,,,,,,,,,
27279,Cartman,7,Calm down.,18,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,
27280,Kyle,7,"NO! I put your headset on, and came here to-",18,Southpark,44,10,,,,,,,,,
27281,Cartman,7,"In virtual reality, yes you did.",18,Southpark,32,6,,,,,,,,,
27282,Kyle,7,No. Then I came into this virtual space.,18,Southpark,40,8,,,,,,,,,
27283,Cartman,7,"You've been in a virtual space all along, Kyle! Think about it: we're arch-rivals! Why would the guys send you in to convince me of anything?!",18,Southpark,142,26,,,,,,,,,
27284,Kyle,7,Fuck you! Why would they sendÎ_youÎ_in to convinceÎ_meÎ_of anything?!,18,Southpark,69,9,,,,,,,,,
27285,Cartman,7,Fuck!,18,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
27287,Kyle,7,Yes. My name is Kyle Broflovski. Can you tell me if I purchased an Oculus Rift headset there?,18,Southpark,93,18,,,,,,,,,
27288,Cartman,7,Or if I did?,18,Southpark,12,4,,,,,,,,,
27289,Kyle,7,"Or if you sold one to an ""Eric Cartman""?",18,Southpark,40,9,,,,,,,,,
27292,Kyle,7,Dude... What?,18,Southpark,13,2,,,,,,,,,
27293,Cartman,7,What?Î_Î_Hello?,18,Southpark,15,1,,,,,,,,,
27295,Cartman,7,Dude. NOW this is getting weird!,18,Southpark,32,6,,,,,,,,,
27299,Stan,7,"No, listen, I called Customer Service because I need help!Î_",18,Southpark,60,10,,,,,,,,,
27300,Kyle,7,"Wait. Stan?Î_Î_Hold on, is this my virtual reality, or Cartman's virtual reality?",18,Southpark,81,12,,,,,,,,,
27301,Stan,7,"It's neither. I know this might be hard for you to grasp right now, but this is all actually real.",18,Southpark,98,20,,,,,,,,,
27302,Kyle,7,"Nono, after we found Cartman, I put the headset on and then-",18,Southpark,60,12,,,,,,,,,
27303,Stan,7,"No dude, dude. We've all been here the entire time.",18,Southpark,51,10,,,,,,,,,
27304,Kyle,7,Holy shit. Then this is all real. We've all been here from the beginning. Taking turns on the Oculus Rift headset.,18,Southpark,114,21,,,,,,,,,
27305,Cartman,7,"No, you guys. This is virtual reality.",18,Southpark,38,7,,,,,,,,,
27306,Stan,7,How do you know?,18,Southpark,16,4,,,,,,,,,
27307,Cartman,7,Because... I'm a computer program.,18,Southpark,34,5,,,,,,,,,
27308,Kyle,7,God damn it Cartman!,18,Southpark,20,4,,,,,,,,,
27309,Cartman,7,"I'm telling you guys, I swear, you have to believe me, I am a computer program. I'm not real.",18,Southpark,93,19,,,,,,,,,
27310,Kyle,7,He's lying.,18,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
27311,Cartman,7,I'm not lying. Go ahead and ask Customer Service.,18,Southpark,49,9,,,,,,,,,
27312,Stan,7,What was the name of the first person who called you for customer service?,18,Southpark,74,14,,,,,,,,,

27316,Stan,7,"Come on, we're going to Butters' house!Î_",18,Southpark,41,7,,,,,,,,,
27330,Butters,7,"I'm troubled, I'm troubled in mind. If Jesus don't help me I surely will die.Î_",18,Southpark,79,15,,,,,,,,,
27331,Stan,7,Butters.,18,Southpark,8,1,,,,,,,,,

27333,Kyle,7,Why not?,18,Southpark,8,2,,,,,,,,,
27334,Butters,7,Because I'm grounded. That means no visitors.,18,Southpark,45,7,,,,,,,,,
27335,Kyle,7,Butters! When did you call Oculus Rift Customer Service?!,18,Southpark,57,9,,,,,,,,,
27336,Butters,7,"When we were playing with the Oculus headset. Wuh don't you guys remember?Î_Î_We were all messin' around with it. I played with it first, and, and went a little nuts. Uh I forgot I was in virtual reality and I got grounded, and now I'm grounded in real life.",18,Southpark,258,49,,,,,,,,,
27337,Stan,7,So now weÎ_areÎ_in th real world.,18,Southpark,33,6,,,,,,,,,
27338,Butters,7,YES.,18,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
27339,Cartman,7,"You guys!Î_Î_I have accepted the reality that I am just a computer program. The fact is that one of us right now is in a room wearing a VR helmet seeing all this, and it's not me!",18,Southpark,179,37,,,,,,,,,
27341,Butters,7,AAaaghagh!,18,Southpark,10,1,,,,,,,,,

27348,Stan,7,Well then how much of what just happened was in virtual reality?,18,Southpark,64,12,,,,,,,,,
27350,Stan,7,What?!Î_,18,Southpark,8,1,,,,,,,,,
27352,Stan,7,That doesn't make sense!Î_,18,Southpark,26,4,,,,,,,,,

27372,Kyle,7,"Alright, dude, take off the headset.Î_",18,Southpark,38,6,,,,,,,,,
27373,Kyle,7,"Sssoo aside from all the bull crap, what do ya think of the Oculus?",18,Southpark,67,14,,,,,,,,,
27374,Stan,7,"It's pretty cool, but the graphics suck.",18,Southpark,40,7,,,,,,,,,
27375,Butters,7,"Fellas, I'm not grounded anymore.",18,Southpark,33,5,,,,,,,,,

27407,Kyle,8,You've never seen anything so ruthless!,18,Southpark,39,6,,,,,,,,,
27408,Stan,8,It was seriously almost hard to watch. ,18,Southpark,39,7,,,,,,,,,
27409,Cartman,8,"At one point, Kenny actually polymorphed the dude into a blue frog with an instant attack card. It was carnage, bro!",18,Southpark,116,21,,,,,,,,,

27441,Stan,8,It was just decimation.,18,Southpark,23,4,,,,,,,,,
27442,Kyle,8,It was really about the most man thing I think we've ever been a part of.,18,Southpark,73,16,,,,,,,,,

27451,Kyle,8,"Yeah, maybe that just kind of what they do naturally.",18,Southpark,53,10,,,,,,,,,
27452,Cartman,8,"Guys, I think maybe Kenny's a little hurt because he was the big Magic champion, and now chickens are stealing his thunder.",18,Southpark,123,22,,,,,,,,,

27467,Stan,8,"Dad, it's not that big a deal.",18,Southpark,30,7,,,,,,,,,
27468,Randy,8,"It is a big deal, okay?! People can get hurt! Believe it or not I was into Cock Magic back in college.",18,Southpark,102,22,,,,,,,,,
27469,Kyle,8,You were?,18,Southpark,9,2,,,,,,,,,

29404,Chef,5,"Ahhhh, of course they won't splice children. Haven't you ever heard that song by 'Loverboy'?",1,Southpark,92,15,,,,,,,,,
29405,Chef,5,"Dooodnnndoodnn - A pig and an elephant DNA just won't_—_A pig-elephant.  Say, now that's not a bad idea.",1,Southpark,104,18,,,,,,,,,
29406,Kyle,5,I told you guys.,1,Southpark,16,4,,,,,,,,,
29407,Chef,5,"Imagine, a pint sized elephant that you could keep in the house.  Children, we could make a fortune with this.",1,Southpark,110,20,,,,,,,,,
29408,Kyle,5,You hear that dudes? We'll be rich!,1,Southpark,35,7,,,,,,,,,
29409,Chef,5,"Forget about all that genetic engineering whoosafudge. If you want to combine a pig and an elephant, just get them to make sweeet love.",1,Southpark,135,24,,,,,,,,,
29410,Cartman,5,Whaaat?!,1,Southpark,8,1,,,,,,,,,

29422,Kyle,5,"Yeah Stan, she's just a girl.",1,Southpark,29,6,,,,,,,,,
29423,Cartman,5,"Yeah, if some girl tried to kick my ass, I'd be like, ""hey, why don't you stop dressin' me up like a mailman, annnd making me dance for you while you go and smoke crack in your bedroom and have sex with some guy I don't even know, on my dad's bed!"" ",1,Southpark,249,52,,,,,,,,,

29474,Chef,5,"Usually about 9:30 in the morning, children.  Uh oh, here we go.  Yeahhh, there's nothing worse than getting all drunk and waking up the next morning next to a pig.  Or a big fat elephant.",1,Southpark,188,35,,,,,,,,,
29475,Kyle,5,"Hey, how do we know if she's pregnant?",1,Southpark,38,8,,,,,,,,,
29476,Chef,5,"Well boys, we might not know that for a couple of days.",1,Southpark,55,12,,,,,,,,,

29482,Chef,5,"Hey, you're that crazy cracker from up on the hill.",1,Southpark,51,10,,,,,,,,,
29484,Kenny,5,,1,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
29485,Stan,5,A big mutant version of me?,1,Southpark,27,6,,,,,,,,,
29486,Kyle,5,Is he bigger than a regular clone?,1,Southpark,34,7,,,,,,,,,
29490,Mr. Garrison,5,"Stan, are you wearing a different hat?",1,Southpark,38,7,,,,,,,,,
29492,Mr. Garrison,5,"Hey, I know a certain young man who's itching for a detention.  Aaaaaah!  Ooooh.",1,Southpark,80,14,,,,,,,,,

29553,Stan,5,"Shelly, you, you saved my life.  And yet, you've done so much more than that.  Today you've taught me the meaning of family.  Sure, families don't always get along, but when the forces of evil descend upon us, we conquer them, by sticking together.  Uh, ahh, oooh. ",1,Southpark,265,47,,,,,,,,,

29560,Stan,5,"Wait, wait, the pig just gave birth.  It, it had a baby!",1,Southpark,56,12,,,,,,,,,
29564,Kyle,5,"Does it look like a pig, or an elephant?",1,Southpark,40,9,,,,,,,,,
29565,Cartman,5,"Hey, it kind of looks like Mr. Garrison.",1,Southpark,40,8,,,,,,,,,
29566,Mr. Garrison,5,"Ohh, uh, gee, isn't that an amazing coincidence?  Hmm, what are the odds of that?",1,Southpark,81,15,,,,,,,,,

29599,Stan,6,"'Cause, I'll get in trouble.",1,Southpark,28,5,,,,,,,,,
29601,Stan,6,Leave me alone grampa. ,1,Southpark,23,4,,,,,,,,,
29610,Kyle,6,"Dude, it's Terrance & Phillip.",1,Southpark,30,5,,,,,,,,,

29620,Cartman,6,"Ha, ha, ha, that's sweet!",1,Southpark,25,5,,,,,,,,,

29624,Stan,6,I'm not going to kill you grampa!,1,Southpark,33,7,,,,,,,,,
29626,Stan,6,Good night grampa.,1,Southpark,18,3,,,,,,,,,
29629,Kyle,6,Ow! What the hell was that for?!,1,Southpark,32,7,,,,,,,,,

29632,Kyle,6,Well I didn't have her do it. She did it on her own.,1,Southpark,52,13,,,,,,,,,
29633,Cartman,6,"Why does this happen every month? It seems like, right around the same time every month, Kyle's mom gets a hair up her ass about something and I always end up getting screwed by it!",1,Southpark,181,35,,,,,,,,,
29634,Mr. Garrison,6,Children! Children! A certain student's mother called me last night.,1,Southpark,68,10,,,,,,,,,
29635,Cartman,6,"Oh, gee, I wonder who's mother that could have been?",1,Southpark,52,10,,,,,,,,,
29636,Mr. Garrison,6,"She informed me that some of you might be watching a, a naughty show called Terrance & Phillip.",1,Southpark,95,18,,,,,,,,,
29639,Mr. Garrison,6,"That's right Mr. Hat, shows like Terrance & Phillip are what we call 'toilet humor.' They don't expand your minds.  You see children, these kind of shows are senseless, vile trash.  Kenny, why are you late to class?  Oh, okay Kenny, be seated.  Now, as I was saying, the reason that parents of South Park are so upset is because...  Yes Kenny, what is it?",1,Southpark,355,65,,,,,,,,,
29640,Kenny,6,,1,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
29641,Mr. Garrison,6,I thought you just came from the bathroom.,1,Southpark,42,8,,,,,,,,,
29642,Kenny,6,,1,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
29643,Mr. Garrison,6,"Okay okay, go ahead.  As I was saying, you all seem to enjoy this show, even though it isn't based in reality. There's much more to life than two young men farting on each other. And throughout history there have always been shows that have come and gone that have been very bad, and usually they get taken right off the air. You see, you should be spending your time enlightening your minds with more intelligent entertainment. ",1,Southpark,429,77,,,,,,,,,
29644,Stan,6,"Whoa, smells like you slaughtered a cow in there Kenny!",1,Southpark,55,10,,,,,,,,,
29645,Mr. Garrison,6,"Pay attention children!  I'm going to join your parents in requesting that you don't watch Terrance & Phillip any more, ever.",1,Southpark,125,21,,,,,,,,,
29646,Cartman,6,What?,1,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
29648,Mr. Garrison,6,"That's right children. Are there any questions?  Yes, Stanley?",1,Southpark,62,9,,,,,,,,,
29649,Stan,6,Is it okay to kill somebody if they want you to?,1,Southpark,48,11,,,,,,,,,
29650,Mr. Garrison,6,"What, what do you mean?",1,Southpark,23,5,,,,,,,,,
29651,Stan,6,"My grampa keeps asking that I kill him all the time, and sometimes I wonder if I should.",1,Southpark,88,18,,,,,,,,,
29652,Kyle,6,"Well, then you should. I think that a person has a right to die if they wanna.",1,Southpark,78,17,,,,,,,,,
29653,Stan,6,Really??,1,Southpark,8,1,,,,,,,,,
29654,Kyle,6,"Yeah, there's this guy named Jack Leborkian that goes around and murders people that ask him to, and he doesn't get in any trouble at all.",1,Southpark,138,26,,,,,,,,,
29655,Stan,6,Wow!,1,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
29656,Cartman,6,"Hey, maybe we can get him to Kyle's mom!",1,Southpark,40,9,,,,,,,,,
29657,Stan,6,"So, is it okay to assist somebody with suicide, Mr. Garrison?",1,Southpark,61,11,,,,,,,,,
29658,Mr. Garrison,6,"Uh, Stan, I'm not touching that one with a twenty-foot pole.",1,Southpark,60,11,,,,,,,,,
29659,Kenny,6,   ,1,Southpark,3,0,,,,,,,,,
29660,Cartman,6,Man! I can't believe we're gonna miss Terrance & Phillip today. I think I'm already having withdrawal. ,1,Southpark,103,17,,,,,,,,,
29661,Stan,6,"Don't worry dude, we can all go watch it at my house. My parents don't get home until late.",1,Southpark,91,19,,,,,,,,,
29662,Kyle,6,But won't your grampa be there?,1,Southpark,31,6,,,,,,,,,
29663,Stan,6,Yeah...,1,Southpark,7,1,,,,,,,,,
29664,Cartman,6,"Just kill 'im dude, maybe he'll give you some money.",1,Southpark,52,10,,,,,,,,,
29665,Chef,6,Hello there children.,1,Southpark,21,3,,,,,,,,,
29666,Stan,6,Hey Chef.,1,Southpark,9,2,,,,,,,,,
29667,Chef,6,How's it goin'?,1,Southpark,15,3,,,,,,,,,

29669,Chef,6,Why bad?,1,Southpark,8,2,,,,,,,,,
29670,Stan,6,"Chef, is it okay to kill your grampa?",1,Southpark,37,8,,,,,,,,,
29671,Chef,6,"You can't kill my grampa Stan, he's already passed on.",1,Southpark,54,10,,,,,,,,,
29672,Stan,6,"No, I mean, kill my grampa.",1,Southpark,27,6,,,,,,,,,
29673,Chef,6,"No, I don't think that's okay Stan. In fact, I think that's illegal.",1,Southpark,68,13,,,,,,,,,
29674,Stan,6,"See, I told you dude.",1,Southpark,21,5,,,,,,,,,
29675,Kyle,6,"Well, yeah, but what if the grampa wants to die, cause he's really old, and he's just asking for help?",1,Southpark,102,20,,,,,,,,,
29676,Cartman,6,"Yeah, like assisted suicide. What about that?",1,Southpark,45,7,,,,,,,,,
29677,Chef,6,I don't want to touch that with a forty foot pole.,1,Southpark,50,11,,,,,,,,,
29678,Stan,6,What's the big deal? Why won't anybody talk about this.,1,Southpark,55,10,,,,,,,,,
29684,Randy,6,"Heh, heh, heh, he farted right on his head, heh heh, ",1,Southpark,53,11,,,,,,,,,
29686,Mr. Garrison,6,"Ohh, I think I've caught a touch of the flu from little Kenny this morning. I've got the green apple splatters.",1,Southpark,111,21,,,,,,,,,
29689,Stan,6,"Hi grampa, I brought my friends over to watch TV, if that's okay.",1,Southpark,65,13,,,,,,,,,
29691,Stan,6,"No grampa, I'll get in trouble.",1,Southpark,31,6,,,,,,,,,
29693,Stan,6,"No, I can't even kill a deer.",1,Southpark,29,7,,,,,,,,,
29695,Cartman,6,I would never kill somebody... not unless the piss me off.,1,Southpark,58,11,,,,,,,,,

33419,Cartman,5,What? Don't you have dodgeball in France?,2,Southpark,41,7,,,,,,,,,
33421,Stan,5,"Look, Pip, the rules are simple. A kid from that team is gonna try to bean a kid on our team in the head with a big red ball.",2,Southpark,125,29,,,,,,,,,
33423,Stan,5,"If the ball hits you, you're out, but if you catch the ball, he's out, and the last team to still have anybody standing wins.",2,Southpark,125,25,,,,,,,,,

33473,Kyle,5,No. No-it looked dead.,2,Southpark,22,4,,,,,,,,,

33510,Kyle,5,Can't we just play with that big parachute again or something?,2,Southpark,62,11,,,,,,,,,
33511,Chef,5,"You-you don't understand, children. If we can win State, we can play in the Nationals in Washington, D.C.!",2,Southpark,106,18,,,,,,,,,

33666,Chef,5,"No, no, no, no, no, that's different. I made fun of them because they are from China.

33698,Chef,5,"Oh, what have I done?  You know, Eric, I just realized something. I have been obsessed, and obsession isn't good.  If we had won the world championship, what then?  It would only be a bigger letdown the next year if we didn't win! Our lives would have to revolve around dodgeball. Our lives were fine before.  Oh, I'm sorry, children. I let it all go to my head. Can you ever forgive me?  Come on, forget this stupid game. Let's go home.",2,Southpark,437,82,,,,,,,,,

33767,Cartman,6,Was it fun?,2,Southpark,11,3,,,,,,,,,

35961,Mr. Garrison,12,"...Well, okay. I suppose you were paying attention.  Anyway, children, the Love Boat did go on for about eight years. They tried to bring it back recently, but it didn't work. Probably 'cause Robert Urich had to weigh... ",2,Southpark,221,38,,,,,,,,,

35973,Stan,12,But I didn't write the note!,2,Southpark,28,6,,,,,,,,,

35994,Randy,12,I don't interrupt you.,2,Southpark,22,4,,,,,,,,,
35997,Randy,12,"Okay, I'm sorry I interrupt. But she always takes over any conversation!",2,Southpark,72,12,,,,,,,,,
36001,Randy,12,When was the last time you had anything interesting to say? It's always gossip and stupid crap!,2,Southpark,95,17,,,,,,,,,
36003,Randy,12,"Well- uh, I feel like everything I do is wrong, it doesn't matter what I say.",2,Southpark,77,16,,,,,,,,,
36005,Stan,12,Excuse me.,2,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,

36021,Kenny,12,,2,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
36022,Cartman,12,"Because I have to stay here and work! I still have to shingle the roof, test the foundation, run all kinds of inspections. I've got way too much to do, and all you have to do is to go find chicks! Now, stop your bitchin'!  Mom, can I watch American Gladiators?",2,Southpark,260,51,,,,,,,,,
36023,Kyle,12,Dude! Where have you been? I've been waiting all afternoon.,2,Southpark,59,10,,,,,,,,,
36024,Stan,12,I got in trouble for that note Bebe was trying to pass to you.,2,Southpark,62,14,,,,,,,,,

36038,Stan,12,I didn't even think about that.,2,Southpark,31,6,,,,,,,,,
36039,Chef,12,"And then, they'll ask, ""Truth or Dare?'",2,Southpark,39,7,,,,,,,,,
36040,Stan,12,"And I say, ""Dare!""",2,Southpark,18,4,,,,,,,,,
36041,Chef,12,"No no! You say, ""Truth.""",2,Southpark,24,5,,,,,,,,,
36042,Stan,12,"""Truth?"" But that's boring! I want to get ""Dare"" to kiss her.",2,Southpark,61,12,,,,,,,,,

36044,Stan,12,Oooh.,2,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,

36052,Stan,12,You really think so?,2,Southpark,20,4,,,,,,,,,

36076,Stan,12,What?! Why?,2,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
36078,Stan,12,"Divorced? On no. Does that mean you and Dad don't love me anymore? This is all my fault, isn't it?",2,Southpark,98,20,,,,,,,,,
36080,Stan,12,"...Dude, you're not supposed to say that!",2,Southpark,41,7,,,,,,,,,

36116,Stan,12,"Well, I don't like being around my sister anymore; does that mean I can leave her, too?",2,Southpark,87,17,,,,,,,,,
36117,Randy,12,"Well, no, because you're a family. You just can't leave family; you have to stick with family, no matter what.",2,Southpark,110,20,,,,,,,,,
36118,Stan,12,"But you and Mom are family; how come you can just split up?  You know what I think? I think that when you and Mom got married, you became family. And now that you are, you shouldn't be able to leave her anymore than I can leave my sister.",2,Southpark,238,49,,,,,,,,,

36128,Kyle,12,Right. Why?,2,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,

38909,Randy,2,"Well, let's see. If they combust... no. Could be from the... no.",3,Southpark,64,12,,,,,,,,,
38910,Stan,2,"Dad, where's our Bible?",3,Southpark,23,4,,,,,,,,,
38911,Randy,2,"Not now, Stan. I have to find out what causes spontaneous combustion. Or else.",3,Southpark,78,14,,,,,,,,,
38912,Stan,2,Or else what?,3,Southpark,13,3,,,,,,,,,
38913,Randy,2,Exactly.,3,Southpark,8,1,,,,,,,,,

38919,Randy,2,New girlfriend?,3,Southpark,15,2,,,,,,,,,
38920,Stan,2,"Yeah, he started seeing this girl and he spent a lot of time taking the bus to go visit her. What does that have to do with his death?",3,Southpark,134,29,,,,,,,,,
38921,Randy,2,Maybe nothing...  maybe everything.,3,Southpark,35,4,,,,,,,,,
38922,Stan,2,"...Well, we're gonna go work on getting Kyle's dad a nurection. ",3,Southpark,64,11,,,,,,,,,
38923,Randy,2,"Yes, yes, of course. I've got work to do.  What?!",3,Southpark,49,10,,,,,,,,,
38924,Stan,2,"Let's see: Jesus got crucified, then he died, then three days later he had his urection. Let's see, there's fourteen Stations of the Cross. Now, it says we can makes costumes out of sheets.",3,Southpark,189,34,,,,,,,,,
38925,Kyle,2,This is gonna be fun.,3,Southpark,21,5,,,,,,,,,
38926,Cartman,2,I'm gonna be Jesus!,3,Southpark,19,4,,,,,,,,,
38927,Kyle,2,You're too fat to be Jesus!,3,Southpark,27,6,,,,,,,,,
38928,Cartman,2,"Oh, and like you're gonna do it, Jew?!",3,Southpark,38,8,,,,,,,,,

38930,Cartman,2,"Either I'm Jesus, or else, screw you guys, I'm going home! ",3,Southpark,59,11,,,,,,,,,
38931,Kyle,2,You're such a fat baby!,3,Southpark,23,5,,,,,,,,,
38932,Cartman,2,"Well, I guess you guys can do the Stations of the Cross by yourselves. ",3,Southpark,71,14,,,,,,,,,
38933,Kyle,2,"All right, all right, you could be Jesus, you tubby cry-baby!",3,Southpark,61,11,,,,,,,,,
38934,Cartman,2,"Stick and stones may break my bones, but I'm Jesus and you aren't.",3,Southpark,66,13,,,,,,,,,

38938,Randy,2,No! Has she been doing anything odd?,3,Southpark,36,7,,,,,,,,,
38940,Randy,2,Boyfriend. And they said Kenny had a new girlfriend.,3,Southpark,52,9,,,,,,,,,
38941,Randy,2,No! I think I might have it.,3,Southpark,28,7,,,,,,,,,
38946,Stan,2,Station One: Jesus is condemned to death by Pilate.,3,Southpark,51,9,,,,,,,,,

38951,Stan,2,Station Two: Jesus takes his cross.,3,Southpark,35,6,,,,,,,,,
38952,Cartman,2,"This cross is seriously heavy. Oh man, this is totally weak.",3,Southpark,60,11,,,,,,,,,
38953,Stan,2,"And then Jesus' disciple, Peter, denies he knows him. ",3,Southpark,54,9,,,,,,,,,
38954,Cartman,2,Peter!,3,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
38955,Kyle,2,"I don't know you, dude.",3,Southpark,23,5,,,,,,,,,

38965,Randy,2,Wow. ,3,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
38967,Stan,2,Station Eleven: Jesus is nailed to the cross. ,3,Southpark,46,8,,,,,,,,,
38968,Cartman,2,Oh! This has gone from weak to superweak! Things cannot get any more weak for me.,3,Southpark,81,16,,,,,,,,,
38969,Stan,2,"Then a crown of thorns was placed on Jesus's head, and Jesus was all like, ""Thanks.""",3,Southpark,84,16,,,,,,,,,
38970,Cartman,2,"Well, this sucks that I have to die, but if I die, everyone's sins will be forgiven.  So I guess it's cool. ",3,Southpark,108,22,,,,,,,,,
38971,Stan,2,"And then Jesus was lead away  to Mount Sinai, where he dies, and has a resurrurection three days later.",3,Southpark,103,19,,,,,,,,,
38972,Cartman,2,"Hi, mom. ",3,Southpark,9,2,,,,,,,,,
38975,Kyle,2,"Hey, that went really well. They really liked it.",3,Southpark,49,9,,,,,,,,,
38976,Cartman,2,"Yeah. I told you I'd be a sweet Jesus, you guys.",3,Southpark,48,11,,,,,,,,,
38977,Kyle,2,"Aw man, at least the real Jesus didn't weigh 400 pounds!",3,Southpark,56,11,,,,,,,,,
38978,Cartman,2,Up your ass with broken glass!,3,Southpark,30,6,,,,,,,,,
38979,Stan,2,This spot looks good. ,3,Southpark,22,4,,,,,,,,,

38981,Stan,2,"Okay, cool. See you, Cartman.",3,Southpark,29,5,,,,,,,,,

38984,Kyle,2,"Yeah, me too.",3,Southpark,13,3,,,,,,,,,
38985,Cartman,2,"Well, get me down from here!",3,Southpark,28,6,,,,,,,,,
38986,Kyle,2,"Cartman, how stupid are you?! Didn't you read the Bible? We have to leave you up there until you die, and then you come back to life in three days.",3,Southpark,147,30,,,,,,,,,
38987,Cartman,2,What?!,3,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
38988,Stan,2,"Yeah, dummy, you have to get a nurection.",3,Southpark,41,8,,,,,,,,,
38989,Kyle,2,Then I can give it to my dad. ,3,Southpark,30,8,,,,,,,,,
38990,Cartman,2,"Hey, uh I don't wanna be Jesus anymore! Don't leave me here, you guys! ...All right, that does it! Screw you guys, I'm going home!  Okay, I'm getting pissed now!  God!",3,Southpark,167,31,,,,,,,,,
38992,Randy,2,"The little boy combusted because he had a new girlfriend. It wasn't the girl that caused him to combust, it was the fact that Kenny did not want to pass gas in front of her.  You see, as food is digested the natural processes give off a byproduct known as methane gas.  The methane gathers here in the bowel area , where it causes pressure. Normally a person would expel this byproduct in the form of a pleasant fart.  Should the gas not be expelled,  the methane can build up and then ignite,  leading to... disaster.  Kenny combusted because he held his farts in for too long.",3,Southpark,578,107,,,,,,,,,
38994,Randy,2,Exactly. ,3,Southpark,9,1,,,,,,,,,
38999,Stan,2,"Whoa, dude, my dad's famous.",3,Southpark,28,5,,,,,,,,,

39007,Cartman,2,"You guys, I mean, seriously! Get me down!",3,Southpark,41,8,,,,,,,,,
39008,Stan,2,"Look, fatass: after you die and get resurrurected, you'll have all kinds of superpowers, just like Jesus.",3,Southpark,105,17,,,,,,,,,

39025,Stan,2,Uh. We've been taking care of him.,3,Southpark,34,7,,,,,,,,,
39026,Kyle,2,Yeah. We're having him resurrurected.,3,Southpark,37,5,,,,,,,,,

39051,Stan,2,"Wow, my dad's the best! All other dads suck compared to my dad!",3,Southpark,63,13,,,,,,,,,
39052,Kyle,2,"Hey! My dad's pretty cool, too.",3,Southpark,31,6,,,,,,,,,
39061,Kyle,2,"Don't worry, guys. I'm getting a nurection as we speak.",3,Southpark,55,10,,,,,,,,,
39063,Kyle,2,"Well, actually, Cartman's getting a nurection. But then, we're gonna give it you. Sooo, buck up! ",3,Southpark,97,16,,,,,,,,,
39065,Stan,2,"Dude, he's still not dead.",3,Southpark,26,5,,,,,,,,,
39066,Cartman,2,"You guys, my mom is totally worried about me. You'd better let me down.",3,Southpark,71,14,,,,,,,,,
39067,Kyle,2,She's not worried about you.,3,Southpark,28,5,,,,,,,,,

39069,Stan,2,That's not your mom calling!,3,Southpark,28,5,,,,,,,,,
39070,Cartman,2,"Yes it is, you guys. I'm serious now. This is Eric's mom and I want him home right now.",3,Southpark,87,19,,,,,,,,,
39071,Kyle,2,How stupid do you think we are?! Now you die on that cross and get resurrurected before I kick your ass!,3,Southpark,104,21,,,,,,,,,
39072,Cartman,2,"You guys, it's too hot out here! I can't do this!",3,Southpark,49,11,,,,,,,,,
39073,Stan,2,He is right. It has been getting really hot lately.,3,Southpark,51,10,,,,,,,,,
39074,Kyle,2,"Yeah, I noticed that too. Let's go get some ice-cold lemonade.",3,Southpark,62,11,,,,,,,,,

39079,Randy,2,"You wanted to see me, Mayor?",3,Southpark,28,6,,,,,,,,,
39081,Randy,2,I suspect you're talking about the dramatic heat wave.,3,Southpark,54,9,,,,,,,,,
39083,Randy,2,"Mayor, I think I'm a little overqualified for this. My scientific mind is best used on global problems.",3,Southpark,103,18,,,,,,,,,

39095,Chef,2,"Eric, I have to tell you something, and it's really gonna bum you out.",3,Southpark,70,14,,,,,,,,,
39096,Cartman,2,What?,3,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
39097,Chef,2,It's really gonna piss you off.,3,Southpark,31,6,,,,,,,,,

39101,Stan,2,"Dad, where's the phone book?",3,Southpark,28,5,,,,,,,,,
39102,Randy,2,"Not now, Stanley. Without my scientific genius, the town is doomed.  Let's see now, when exactly did the temperature start to go up?",3,Southpark,132,23,,,,,,,,,
39104,Stan,2,"Yeah, um, Jesus, after you got crucified, how long did it take you to die and resurrect?",3,Southpark,88,17,,,,,,,,,
39105,Randy,2,Stan?,3,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
39107,Stan,2,Oh.,3,Southpark,3,1,,,,,,,,,
39109,Stan,2,"Uh, it... sucks ass.",3,Southpark,20,4,,,,,,,,,
39112,Randy,2,Awww crap.,3,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,
39119,Randy,2,"Well, they're right. We should have known that all that methane could adversely affect the atmosphere.",3,Southpark,102,16,,,,,,,,,
39121,Randy,2,Hey!,3,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
39124,Stan,2,"Oh my God, what's going on?",3,Southpark,27,6,,,,,,,,,
39126,Randy,2,"Uuuh, I- I'll try to find a solution.",3,Southpark,37,8,,,,,,,,,

39136,Stan,2,"Dude, that's my dad!",3,Southpark,20,4,,,,,,,,,
39137,Kyle,2,"...Oh, yeah. Sorry.",3,Southpark,19,3,,,,,,,,,
39139,Randy,2,I-I don't know what to say.,3,Southpark,27,6,,,,,,,,,
39141,Kyle,2,"Dude, those people are pissed!",3,Southpark,30,5,,,,,,,,,
39142,Stan,2,"I know, huh?",3,Southpark,12,3,,,,,,,,,
39143,Kyle,2,Where's your dad?,3,Southpark,17,3,,,,,,,,,

39154,Stan,2,"What are you doing, dad?",3,Southpark,24,5,,,,,,,,,
39155,Randy,2,"Stanley, I think its best you live with Kyle from now on. His dad is better than me.",3,Southpark,84,18,,,,,,,,,
39156,Stan,2,"No, he's not! He can't even get a nurection!",3,Southpark,44,9,,,,,,,,,
39157,Randy,2,Hm. Really?,3,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
39158,Stan,2,"Dad, you've got to work! People are dying, dad. You've got to come up with a solution!",3,Southpark,86,17,,,,,,,,,
39159,Randy,2,"Not me. I'm not a scientist, I'm a hack. Even if I found a solution, those people would still all hate me.",3,Southpark,106,22,,,,,,,,,
39160,Stan,2,"Well, that doesn't matter! I learned something from the Stations of the Cross.",3,Southpark,78,13,,,,,,,,,
39161,Randy,2,What?,3,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
39162,Stan,2,"See, at first, Jesus was all like, ""Why me?"" And he was all pissed off and stuff. But then he saw that what mattered most was everybody else. So he stopped thinking about his own misery, and did what had to be done. Right as Jesus was dying,  he raised his hand and said, ""The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.""",3,Southpark,326,65,,,,,,,,,
39163,Randy,2,"You're right, Stanley. You're absolutely right.  Hey, that Bible sounds like kind of a good book.",3,Southpark,97,16,,,,,,,,,
39164,Stan,2,It ain't bad. You should try reading it sometime. ,3,Southpark,50,9,,,,,,,,,
39165,Kyle,2,"Dude, that was Star Trek again.",3,Southpark,31,6,,,,,,,,,
39166,Stan,2,Huh?,3,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
39167,Kyle,2,"""The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few?"" That was Wrath of Khan.",3,Southpark,78,16,,,,,,,,,
39168,Stan,2,"Uh, well, Bible, Wrath of Khan, what's the difference?",3,Southpark,54,9,,,,,,,,,
39169,Randy,2,"All right. Now, let's get to work.",3,Southpark,34,7,,,,,,,,,
39171,Stan,2,Dad. Dad! ,3,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,

39173,Stan,2,"Dad, what are you doin?! You have to get started!",3,Southpark,49,10,,,,,,,,,
39174,Randy,2,"...Right, right right.",3,Southpark,22,3,,,,,,,,,
39176,Kyle,2,She's upstairs.,3,Southpark,15,2,,,,,,,,,
39178,Kyle,2,Really? Great! I don't have to worry about that anymore. ,3,Southpark,57,10,,,,,,,,,

39184,Randy,2,"Please, just listen to me. I think I found the answer.",3,Southpark,54,11,,,,,,,,,
39186,Randy,2,"It's all about moderation. If you never fart, you combust, but if you always fart, you deplete the ozone. So we must fart only at appropriate times or when it's really, really funny.",3,Southpark,182,33,,,,,,,,,
39188,Randy,2,"I know you all hate me, but please, for your own sake, fart in moderation. You can keep stoning me now, if you want.  Ow.",3,Southpark,121,25,,,,,,,,,
39190,Stan,2,See? My dad is the coolest after all.,3,Southpark,37,8,,,,,,,,,
39191,Kyle,2,"Well, my dad is, too.",3,Southpark,21,5,,,,,,,,,
39192,Stan,2,Cartman!,3,Southpark,8,1,,,,,,,,,
39193,Kyle,2,I forgot all about him. ,3,Southpark,24,5,,,,,,,,,
39194,Stan,2,"He's been up there for like, three weeks.",3,Southpark,41,8,,,,,,,,,
39195,Kyle,2,Wow!,3,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
39196,Stan,2,That's amazing!,3,Southpark,15,2,,,,,,,,,
39197,Cartman,2,"Hey you guys, I am really pissed off now.",3,Southpark,41,9,,,,,,,,,
39198,Kyle,2,"Dude! You're still alive, Cartman?",3,Southpark,34,5,,,,,,,,,
39199,Cartman,2,Get me down from here!,3,Southpark,22,5,,,,,,,,,
39200,Stan,2,"Dude, you survived all this time on the fat stored up in your body?",3,Southpark,67,14,,,,,,,,,
39201,Cartman,2,"Yes. And when I get down from here, I'm gonna kick you both right in the nuts.",3,Southpark,78,17,,,,,,,,,
39202,Cartman,3,"Mom, please can we just leave?",3,Southpark,30,6,,,,,,,,,
39204,Cartman,3,But I hate the eye doctor. He always makes fun of me for being fat.,3,Southpark,67,15,,,,,,,,,

39235,Stan,3,"Yeah. Usually when he ditches school, he still shows up for lunch.",3,Southpark,66,12,,,,,,,,,
39236,Kenny,3,{Maybe he took a dump and got sick.} ,3,Southpark,37,8,,,,,,,,,
39237,Kyle,3,"Yeah.  Oh, here he comes.",3,Southpark,25,5,,,,,,,,,
39238,Cartman,3,Hey dudes.,3,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,

39243,Stan,3,Why do you have to see an eye doctor?,3,Southpark,37,9,,,,,,,,,
39244,Cartman,3,"Because my eyes suck. But that doctor likes to torture me and I have to go back tomorrow, and I don't know what I'm gonna do.",3,Southpark,125,26,,,,,,,,,
39245,Kyle,3,"Dude, just ask Chef for help. He always knows what to do.",3,Southpark,57,12,,,,,,,,,
39246,Cartman,3,"Hey, yeah!  Ow!",3,Southpark,15,3,,,,,,,,,

39257,Stan,3,Why did Chef quit?,3,Southpark,18,4,,,,,,,,,
39259,Stan,3,Could you just hand us some food please?,3,Southpark,40,8,,,,,,,,,

39268,Stan,3,"Chef, what the hell are you doing? We almost starved to death at lunch today.",3,Southpark,77,15,,,,,,,,,
39269,Chef,3,Oh! Didn't they tell you? I quit.,3,Southpark,33,7,,,,,,,,,
39270,Kyle,3,"Yeah, but we didn't believe them.",3,Southpark,33,6,,,,,,,,,
39271,Chef,3,"Well, it's true.",3,Southpark,16,3,,,,,,,,,
39272,Stan,3,But why? Why would you quit?,3,Southpark,28,6,,,,,,,,,
39273,Chef,3,"Children, three nights ago I was at the library checking out some books on Kama Sutra when I met the most amazing woman ever. She knew so much about so many things. She really got me thinking. We eventually came back to my place and really hit it off.",3,Southpark,251,49,,,,,,,,,
39274,Stan,3,So you made sweet love to her down by the fire.,3,Southpark,47,11,,,,,,,,,
39275,Chef,3,"No no, we just sat there all night long and... taaalked.",3,Southpark,56,11,,,,,,,,,
39276,Stan,3,Talked?!,3,Southpark,8,1,,,,,,,,,
39277,Chef,3,"Yeah. She told me all about the powers of goddess, and how men have been oppressing women for years  and viewing them as sexual objects, and I realized that I had done that myself.",3,Southpark,180,34,,,,,,,,,
39279,Chef,3,"Here she is now. Children, meet my new girlfriend, Veronica.",3,Southpark,60,10,,,,,,,,,
39280,Stan,3,"That's nice. Look Chef, Cartman's got this eye doctor, see, and he- Girlfriend?!",3,Southpark,80,13,,,,,,,,,

39283,Chef,3,I'm in love.,3,Southpark,12,3,,,,,,,,,
39286,Stan,3,What the hell is going on?!,3,Southpark,27,6,,,,,,,,,
39287,Chef,3,Veronica spent the whole day sharing her favorite poems with me.,3,Southpark,64,11,,,,,,,,,
39289,Kyle,3,"But Chef always helps us with our problems. When we have a problem, Chef sings to us and makes it better.",3,Southpark,105,21,,,,,,,,,
39290,Chef,3,"Well, I can still do that, children. In fact, Veronica can help me. She's a great singer, too.",3,Southpark,94,18,,,,,,,,,
39292,Cartman,3,"My eyes are going bad, but the only eye doctor in South Park is really, really mean.",3,Southpark,84,17,,,,,,,,,
39294,Chef,3,We have a chance to find the sunshine.,3,Southpark,38,8,,,,,,,,,
39296,Kyle,3,This... is insane. ,3,Southpark,19,3,,,,,,,,,
39297,Kyle,3,That bitch!,3,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
39298,Stan,3,She's stealing Chef from us.,3,Southpark,28,5,,,,,,,,,
39299,Kyle,3,He didn't even seem like Chef. He seemed like a empty shell of a man.,3,Southpark,69,15,,,,,,,,,
39300,Cartman,3,Maybe it's just a phase. We just have to get him alone so we can tell him what a bitch she is.,3,Southpark,94,22,,,,,,,,,
39301,Stan,3,"Wait you guys.  Maybe, is it possible that we're just jealous because Chef is our friend, and now he's paying attention to somebody new? ",3,Southpark,137,24,,,,,,,,,
39302,Kyle,3,"Yeah, so?",3,Southpark,9,2,,,,,,,,,
39303,Stan,3,"...Yeah, screw that bitch.",3,Southpark,26,4,,,,,,,,,
39304,Cartman,3,"Bitch, I hate that bitch!",3,Southpark,25,5,,,,,,,,,
39305,Kyle,3,"Look, we've just gotta get Chef alone. He won't listen to reason with that hooker around.",3,Southpark,89,16,,,,,,,,,
39306,Stan,3,Let's find out where he's working and go see him there tomorrow.,3,Southpark,64,12,,,,,,,,,
39307,Kyle,3,Good idea.,3,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,
39309,Cartman,3,Stop calling me piggy!,3,Southpark,22,4,,,,,,,,,
39311,Cartman,3,"So, what does that mean?",3,Southpark,24,5,,,,,,,,,
39313,Cartman,3,"All right. Right now, I'm gonna be totally serious, dude. Okay? If you call me piggy one more time, I'm gonna leap out of this chair  and rip your god-damned nuts off with my bare hands!",3,Southpark,186,36,,,,,,,,,
39315,Cartman,3,"Oh, dude! Super weak! I'm not wearing these; the guys would totally rip on me.",3,Southpark,78,15,,,,,,,,,
39317,Cartman,3,I'm just gonna take them off as soon as I leave!,3,Southpark,48,11,,,,,,,,,
39319,Cartman,3,Ow! Son of a bitch!,3,Southpark,19,5,,,,,,,,,
39320,Kyle,3,They said that Chef works in one of these buildings ,3,Southpark,52,10,,,,,,,,,

39329,Kenny,3,{And a real huge dick.},3,Southpark,23,5,,,,,,,,,
39331,Stan,3,Huh?,3,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,

39339,Stan,3,"Chef, you have to dump the bitch!",3,Southpark,33,7,,,,,,,,,

39341,Kyle,3,"We need you, Chef.",3,Southpark,18,4,,,,,,,,,
39343,Chef,3,You bet! ,3,Southpark,9,2,,,,,,,,,
39344,Kyle,3,"Chef, this place isn't you!",3,Southpark,27,5,,,,,,,,,
39345,Chef,3,"Children, Veronica showed me that I've been living a very empty life. Meaningless sex is fun for twenty or thirty years, but after that, it starts to get old.",3,Southpark,158,29,,,,,,,,,
39346,Stan,3,But we don't like her.,3,Southpark,22,5,,,,,,,,,
39347,Chef,3,Why not??,3,Southpark,9,2,,,,,,,,,
39348,Stan,3,I don't know-uh. No reason I guess.,3,Southpark,35,7,,,,,,,,,
39349,Chef,3,"Children, friends get girlfriends all the time. It's something even you will have to face with each other some day.",3,Southpark,115,20,,,,,,,,,
39350,Kyle,3,"No way, dude!",3,Southpark,13,3,,,,,,,,,
39351,Cartman,3,"Please, Chef! I don't know what to do about my stupid glasses.",3,Southpark,62,12,,,,,,,,,
39352,Chef,3,That's easy! Get some laser corrective surgery. That's what I did.,3,Southpark,66,11,,,,,,,,,
39353,Cartman,3,Hey! Laser corrective surgery! Thanks Chef!,3,Southpark,43,6,,,,,,,,,
39354,Chef,3,You see? Everything's gonna be fine. Now how about I meet you boys after work and we can play ball?,3,Southpark,99,20,,,,,,,,,
39356,Kyle,3,Chef should be here any minute.,3,Southpark,31,6,,,,,,,,,
39357,Stan,3,Dude! He bailed on us!,3,Southpark,22,5,,,,,,,,,
39358,Kyle,3,I can't believe it!,3,Southpark,19,4,,,,,,,,,
39359,Stan,3,Come on! We're going to his house! ,3,Southpark,35,7,,,,,,,,,
39360,Chef,3,"Oh! Uh, hello there, children.",3,Southpark,30,5,,,,,,,,,

39362,Chef,3,"Oh, children, I'm sorry. I forgot.",3,Southpark,34,6,,,,,,,,,
39363,Stan,3,You forgot!,3,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
39364,Chef,3,Veronica surprised me at the office and took me out to dinner.  She's so amazing.,3,Southpark,81,15,,,,,,,,,
39365,Kyle,3,"Well, we've got something to tell you about Veronica, Chef!",3,Southpark,59,10,,,,,,,,,
39367,Cartman,3,"Ma'am, we're having a dude moment here, if you don't mind?",3,Southpark,58,11,,,,,,,,,

39372,Chef,3,If we can hold on through the night.We have a chance to find the sunshine.,3,Southpark,74,15,,,,,,,,,
39373,Mr. Garrison,3,"And that, children, is what you need to know about The Facts Of Life. So, let's review.  Tootie left in the fourth season, but Blair and Jo stayed on and got husbands, leaving the fifth and sixth seasons hideously stagnant.  Okay children, that's lunch. See you in thirty minutes.

39377,Mr. Garrison,3,"Well children, I am your teacher. I think you'll find that my advice is just as valuable as Chef's, if not more so.",3,Southpark,115,23,,,,,,,,,
39378,Kyle,3,"All right. Mr. Garrison, have you ever had a friend who got a new girlfriend, and then stopped being your friend, and it pissed you off?",3,Southpark,136,26,,,,,,,,,
39379,Mr. Garrison,3,"Oh, the old succubus syndrome.",3,Southpark,30,5,,,,,,,,,
39380,Stan,3,What's a succubus?,3,Southpark,18,3,,,,,,,,,
39381,Mr. Garrison,3,A succubus is a woman sent from Hell to suck the life out of a man.,3,Southpark,67,16,,,,,,,,,
39382,Kyle,3,That's it!,3,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,
39383,Stan,3,Yeah!,3,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
39384,Mr. Garrison,3,"Yeah, there's not much you can do about a succubus. Their evil power makes man blind to love.",3,Southpark,93,18,,,,,,,,,

39386,Stan,3,"Wow, you are smart, Mr. Garrison!",3,Southpark,33,6,,,,,,,,,
39387,Mr. Garrison,3,"Yeah, I tell you boys, women can kill. Poontang's expensive. That's why when it comes to chicks, I just screw them and leave them. I'd say ""get out of my bedroom, poontang, before you suck my life dry!""",3,Southpark,202,38,,,,,,,,,
39388,Kyle,3,"Thanks, Mr. Garrison.",3,Southpark,21,3,,,,,,,,,

Ahem...I heard there is no Christmas in the silly Middle East No trees, no snow, no Santa Claus; They have different religious beliefsThey believe in Muhammad, and not in our holiday.And so, every December I go to the Middle East and say, Hey there, Mr. Muslim, Merry Fuckin' Christmas!Put down that book, the Koran, and hear some holiday wishes In case you haven't noticed, it's Jesus' birthday So get off your heathen Muslim ass and fuckin' celebrate. There is no holiday season in India, I've heard. They don't hang up their stockings, and that is just absurd. They've never read a Christmas story, they don't know what Rudolph is about.And that is why in December I'll go to India and shout,Hey there, Mr. Hinduist, Merry Fuckin' Christmas!Drink eggnog and eat some beef, and pass it to the Missus. In case you haven't noticed, it's Jesus' birthday. So get off your heathen Hindu ass and fuckin' celebrate. Now, I heard that in Japan everyone just lives in sin.They pray to several gods and put needles in their skin.On December 25th all they do is eat a cake.And that is why I go to Japan and walk around and say,Hey there, Mr. Shintoist!, Merry Fuckin' Christmas!God is gonna kick your ass, you infidelic pagan scum.In case you haven't noticed, there's festive things to do. So let's all rejoice for Jesus, and Merry Fuckin' Christmas to you.

44379,Cartman,1,"Ey! Don't call me fat, asshole!",4,Southpark,31,6,,,,,,,,,
44383,Stan,1,"Dude, this is horrible. We gotta get Cartman out of court so we can go practice.",4,Southpark,80,16,,,,,,,,,
44385,Cartman,1,No!,4,Southpark,3,1,,,,,,,,,
44391,Cartman,1,"Kenny! Kenny, you have to get me out of town!",4,Southpark,45,10,,,,,,,,,
44392,Kenny,1,,4,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
44393,Cartman,1,They're gonna put me in jail for a hate crime! You have to take me to Mexico!,4,Southpark,77,17,,,,,,,,,
44394,Kenny,1,,4,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
44395,Cartman,1,"Calm down, Kenny!",4,Southpark,17,3,,,,,,,,,
44396,Kenny,1,,4,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
44397,Cartman,1,Do you still have that battery-powered toy truck you got last Christmas?!,4,Southpark,73,12,,,,,,,,,
44398,Kenny,1,,4,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
44399,Cartman,1,"Well, come on! I don't have much time! ",4,Southpark,39,8,,,,,,,,,
44402,Cartman,1,"Damnit, Kenny! Can't this thing go any faster?!",4,Southpark,47,8,,,,,,,,,
44403,Kenny,1, ,4,Southpark,1,0,,,,,,,,,
44407,Kyle,1,What the hell are they doing?,4,Southpark,29,6,,,,,,,,,
44409,Stan,1,"Dude, if Kenny takes Cartman to Mexico, how are we ever gonna win the sledding race on Saturday?",4,Southpark,96,18,,,,,,,,,
44410,Kyle,1,"Don't worry, dude. That little truck just runs on D batteries. It's gonna run out of juice soon. ",4,Southpark,97,18,,,,,,,,,
44411,Cartman,1,"We're gonna make it, Kenny! We're gonna make it to Mexico!  Oh, God dammit! ",4,Southpark,76,14,,,,,,,,,
44412,Stan,1,Hello?,4,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
44414,Stan,1,Son of a bitch!,4,Southpark,15,4,,,,,,,,,
44417,Cartman,1,Huh-who's Romper Stomper?,4,Southpark,25,3,,,,,,,,,
44421,Stan,1,"Alright, guys. It looks like Cartman's not gonna be able to sled with us for another... 13 years, so in the meantime we need someone to race with us against the girls on Saturday.",4,Southpark,179,34,,,,,,,,,
44422,Kyle,1,"Yeah. Cartman's weight was what gave us speed, so we need to find the next-fattest kid besides Cartman. ",4,Southpark,104,18,,,,,,,,,
44423,Stan,1,"Come on, who's the second-fattest kid in South Park?",4,Southpark,52,9,,,,,,,,,
44424,Butters,1,"...Uuhh, I think Clyde is the next-fattest uh-kid.",4,Southpark,50,8,,,,,,,,,
44426,Kyle,1,"Yeah. Okay, get over here, Clyde.",4,Southpark,33,6,,,,,,,,,
44428,Stan,1,"Deal with it, dude! Cartman's gone, so now you're the fat kid.",4,Southpark,62,12,,,,,,,,,
44429,Kyle,1,"Yeah, fatass! Get your fat butt on the sled!",4,Southpark,44,9,,,,,,,,,
44431,Stan,1,"Dah, that's what they all say. Okay, ready? Go! ",4,Southpark,48,9,,,,,,,,,
44432,Kyle,1,"Awwgh! Hey dude, we don't even have enough weight to move.",4,Southpark,58,11,,,,,,,,,
44434,Stan,1,"Nice going, fat boy!",4,Southpark,20,4,,,,,,,,,
44437,Cartman,1,Uh... 'Cause I'm just like you guys. Uh-I'm one of you.,4,Southpark,55,11,,,,,,,,,
44439,Cartman,1,"Oh, uh, well, personally, I... uhuhuhuh, I... don't like Animaniacs?",4,Southpark,68,10,,,,,,,,,
44441,Cartman,1,"Oh, thank you, Jesus.  So we're friends now?",4,Southpark,44,8,,,,,,,,,
44444,Cartman,1,"Yeah, neither do I. Friends suck.",4,Southpark,33,6,,,,,,,,,
44446,Stan,1,"Okay, we've figured it out. To add more weight to the sled, we're gonna use these bricks , but we're gonna cover 'em with kid's clothes so that the girls think it's another kid!",4,Southpark,177,34,,,,,,,,,
44450,Kyle,1,"Yeah, why don't you go eat some more pork rinds or something, you fat fuck?! ",4,Southpark,77,15,,,,,,,,,
44451,Stan,1,"Come on, let's get it a try. ",4,Southpark,29,7,,,,,,,,,
44453,Stan,1,Yeah-,4,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
44455,Stan,1,"Dude, bail! Bail! ",4,Southpark,18,3,,,,,,,,,
44456,Kenny,1,      ,4,Southpark,6,0,,,,,,,,,
44457,Stan,1,"Ooh, my God, we killed Kenny.",4,Southpark,29,6,,,,,,,,,
44458,Kyle,1,We killed Kenny?,4,Southpark,16,3,,,,,,,,,
44459,Stan,1,We Killed Kenny. We're bastards. ,4,Southpark,33,5,,,,,,,,,
44460,Kyle,1,"Well, that didn't work. What else can we try?",4,Southpark,45,9,,,,,,,,,
44461,Stan,1,Nothing else is gonna work.  We have to face the fact that without Cartman we're gonna lose to a bunch o' girls.,4,Southpark,112,22,,,,,,,,,
44462,Butters,1,"Well, uh-I sure do hate to, uh, to see my gender tuh, lose to a bunch o' women!",4,Southpark,79,18,,,,,,,,,
44464,Stan,1,"You know something, guys? I think we all took Cartman's ass for granted.",4,Southpark,72,13,,,,,,,,,
44466,Kyle,1,If only we had realized how special our time with his gigantic ass was.,4,Southpark,71,14,,,,,,,,,
44467,Butters,1,"Well, all that time we didn't understand what a... unique and magical ass it was.",4,Southpark,81,15,,,,,,,,,
44469,Stan,1,That does it! We've got no other choice! We've got to bust Cartman out of jail!,4,Southpark,79,16,,,,,,,,,
44472,Kyle,1,How?,4,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
44473,Stan,1,I saw a movie once where they baked a cake and put a nail file inside of it.,4,Southpark,76,18,,,,,,,,,
44474,Kyle,1,Sweet! Let's go!,4,Southpark,16,3,,,,,,,,,
44484,Cartman,1,Hey you guys.,4,Southpark,13,3,,,,,,,,,

44486,Cartman,1,"Well, it sucks balls. Whattaya think?",4,Southpark,37,6,,,,,,,,,
44487,Stan,1,"Cartman, why the hell did you have to commit a hate crime?! We're gonna lose to girls because of you!",4,Southpark,101,20,,,,,,,,,
44488,Kyle,1,Yeah! So you gotta bust out of here.  So we made you this cake.  There's a ailnay ilefay inside of it.,4,Southpark,102,21,,,,,,,,,

44494,Cartman,1,"I'd love to eat a cake, you guys, but they don't let us take anything back to the cells from here",4,Southpark,97,21,,,,,,,,,
44495,Kyle,1,"They on'tday?!  Why the ellhay otnay?! It ooktay ourfay ourshay to akebay this Od-damnedgay akecay, and ownay we're otallytay ewedscray!",4,Southpark,136,20,,,,,,,,,

44497,Cartman,1,"Look, that's not important right now! Did you guys bring the cigarettes?",4,Southpark,72,12,,,,,,,,,
44498,Kyle,1,"Well, we got some cigarettes, but we don't think you should be smoking. Each year, over a million people die of smo-",4,Southpark,116,22,,,,,,,,,
44499,Cartman,1,Just hand over the God-damned cigarettes!,4,Southpark,41,6,,,,,,,,,
44500,Stan,1,Sshh! ,4,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
44501,Cartman,1,"Look, if you guys want me back to win the sledding race,  then I need those cigarettes.",4,Southpark,87,17,,,,,,,,,
44502,Stan,1,How are we supposed to give them to you?,4,Southpark,40,9,,,,,,,,,
44503,Cartman,1,Just pass them through these little drill holes here. That's what everybody does.,4,Southpark,81,13,,,,,,,,,
44504,Stan,1,But they're gonna search you on your way back to your cell.,4,Southpark,59,12,,,,,,,,,

44510,Cartman,1,"Okay, guys, eh... If you'll excuse me, I must be going now. ",4,Southpark,60,12,,,,,,,,,
44511,Kyle,1,Don't fart on your way out; you might make little smoke signals. ,4,Southpark,65,12,,,,,,,,,
44512,Cartman,1,"Hahah. Very funny, you guys, hahah. ",4,Southpark,36,6,,,,,,,,,
44513,Stan,1,That sucks that we couldn't give him the nail file. ,4,Southpark,52,10,,,,,,,,,
44514,Kyle,1,So now what do we do?,4,Southpark,21,6,,,,,,,,,
44515,Stan,1,"There's only one thing we can do. We have to go see Token and see if he'll forgive Cartman for hate-criming him. Come on, we're running out of time!",4,Southpark,148,29,,,,,,,,,
44517,Cartman,1,Yes. They are safely concealed in the depths of my ass.,4,Southpark,55,11,,,,,,,,,

44521,Cartman,1,"Well, you spend eight years takin' a crap and then flushin' the toilet; it sorta becomes a reflex! Please, just help me bust out of here.",4,Southpark,137,26,,,,,,,,,
44523,Cartman,1,Son of a bitch!,4,Southpark,15,4,,,,,,,,,
44524,Kyle,1,"Dude, I didn't know Token lived so far away.",4,Southpark,44,9,,,,,,,,,
44525,Stan,1,"Yeah. You know, they bus in people from different races to our school to promote cultural diversity.",4,Southpark,100,17,,,,,,,,,
44526,Kyle,1,Yeah. But isn't Token the only one?,4,Southpark,35,7,,,,,,,,,
44527,Stan,1,Yeah. ,4,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
44529,Stan,1,Hi. Can Token come out and play?,4,Southpark,32,7,,,,,,,,,
44531,Kyle,1,Killer.,4,Southpark,7,1,,,,,,,,,
44532,Stan,1,"Token, you don't wanna see us guys lose to girls tomorrow, do you?",4,Southpark,66,13,,,,,,,,,
44534,Kyle,1,"Well then,  you've got to call the jail right now and tell them that you forgive Cartman for being a dumbass!",4,Southpark,109,21,,,,,,,,,
44537,Stan,1,It's not?,4,Southpark,9,2,,,,,,,,,
44539,Kyle,1,"Dammit! Son of a bitch, dammit!  Oh, sorry.",4,Southpark,43,8,,,,,,,,,
44541,Kyle,1,Huh?,4,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
44543,Stan,1,"Well, why don't you tell the governor yourself?",4,Southpark,47,8,,,,,,,,,
44545,Kyle,1,Why not?,4,Southpark,8,2,,,,,,,,,
44549,Cartman,1,"Oh, thank God! Oh, thank you, Jesus, uh! Hoh.  Here you go, God-damnit!",4,Southpark,71,13,,,,,,,,,
44551,Cartman,1,"Well, what the hell do you expect, huh?! Now I got your stupid game; tell me how to break out of here!",4,Southpark,102,22,,,,,,,,,
44553,Cartman,1,But you said-,4,Southpark,13,3,,,,,,,,,
44555,Cartman,1,I thought that-,4,Southpark,15,3,,,,,,,,,
44557,Cartman,1,I want my Mo-omm ,4,Southpark,17,4,,,,,,,,,
44559,Cartman,1,"Mommy, I want my Mommy! ",4,Southpark,24,5,,,,,,,,,

44567,Stan,1,"Okay, go ahead and start.",4,Southpark,25,5,,,,,,,,,
44568,Kyle,1,"I don't start, you start.",4,Southpark,25,5,,,,,,,,,
44569,Stan,1,"Oh, uhyeah.  Hello, Mr. Governor, and thank you for taking the time to hear our presentation on hate-crime laws, entitled, ""Hate Crime Laws: A Savage Hypocrisy.""  Yes, over the past few years our great country has been developing new hate crime laws.",4,Southpark,250,42,,,,,,,,,
44571,Kyle,1,"And we think that that is  a savage hypocrisy, because all crimes are hate crimes. If a man beats another man because that man was sleeping with his wife, is that not a hate crime?",4,Southpark,180,35,,,,,,,,,
44572,Stan,1,"If a person vandalizes a government building, is it not because of his hate for the government?",4,Southpark,95,17,,,,,,,,,
44574,Stan,1,"Mayor, it is time to stop splitting people into groups. All hate crimes do is support the idea that blacks are different from whites, that homosexuals need to be treated differently from non-homos, that we aren't the same.",4,Southpark,222,38,,,,,,,,,
44575,Kyle,1,"But instead, we should all be treated the same, with the same laws and the same punishments for the same crimes . For in that way Cartman can be freed from prison, and we  will have a chance to win the sledding race on Thursday.",4,Southpark,228,45,,,,,,,,,
44576,Stan,1,That is our presentation. An idea that we call...,4,Southpark,49,9,,,,,,,,,
44580,Cartman,1,What's the matter?,4,Southpark,18,3,,,,,,,,,
44582,Cartman,1,Uhokay. ,4,Southpark,8,1,,,,,,,,,
44584,Cartman,1,Oh. Really?,4,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
44586,Cartman,1,Yeah. I never really realized that until just now.,4,Southpark,50,9,,,,,,,,,
44588,Cartman,1,Okay. ,4,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
44590,Cartman,1,Oh. I can't take these. ,4,Southpark,24,5,,,,,,,,,
44592,Cartman,1,Romper?,4,Southpark,7,1,,,,,,,,,
44594,Cartman,1,"You... well... I know you don't think you've... ever been anybody's friend, but, well, you're a friend to me.",4,Southpark,109,19,,,,,,,,,
44596,Cartman,1,"You'll never take us alive! We're going down together, pigs!",4,Southpark,60,10,,,,,,,,,
44598,Cartman,1,"O ho ho, sweet. Later, dudes. ",4,Southpark,30,6,,,,,,,,,
44600,Stan,1,Just wait. We got Cartman pardoned; he'll be here any second.,4,Southpark,61,11,,,,,,,,,
44601,Kyle,1,He's gotta show up. He's just got to.,4,Southpark,37,8,,,,,,,,,
44604,Kyle,1,"Dude, I guess we've just got to try it without him.",4,Southpark,51,11,,,,,,,,,
44605,Stan,1,"Alright, where's Clyde.",4,Southpark,23,3,,,,,,,,,
44607,Stan,1,"Get on the sled, you fat piece of shit!",4,Southpark,39,9,,,,,,,,,
44609,Kyle,1,"On the sled, fatass!",4,Southpark,20,4,,,,,,,,,
44612,Butters,1,"Huh-okay. Uh-ready, uhset,-",4,Southpark,27,3,,,,,,,,,
44613,Cartman,1,You guys! ,4,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,
44614,Stan,1,It's Cartman!,4,Southpark,13,2,,,,,,,,,
44616,Cartman,1,That's right! I'm back! ,4,Southpark,24,4,,,,,,,,,
44618,Cartman,1,What the hell's wrong with Clyde?,4,Southpark,33,6,,,,,,,,,
44620,Stan,1,All right! Let's do this!,4,Southpark,25,5,,,,,,,,,
44621,Butters,1,Okay. Everybody ready? On your marks.,4,Southpark,37,6,,,,,,,,,
44622,Cartman,1,I hope I can adjust to life outside of the big house.,4,Southpark,53,12,,,,,,,,,
44623,Butters,1,Uh-get set. Go! ,4,Southpark,16,3,,,,,,,,,
44624,Cartman,1,"Been on the inside for so long, I don't remember how to live on the outside.",4,Southpark,76,16,,,,,,,,,
44625,Kyle,1,"Go, fatass!",4,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
44626,Cartman,1,"When a man is stripped of his freedom, degraded in the ways that I was, it's-",4,Southpark,77,16,,,,,,,,,
44628,Stan,1,Come on! We've gotta catch up to them! ,4,Southpark,39,8,,,,,,,,,
44630,Kyle,1,Oh no! The girls are gonna win!,4,Southpark,31,7,,,,,,,,,
44632,Stan,1,We're not gonna make it! ,4,Southpark,25,5,,,,,,,,,
44633,Cartman,1,Hey. ,4,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
44637,Stan,1,We did it!,4,Southpark,10,3,,,,,,,,,
44639,Kyle,1,We won! We won!,4,Southpark,15,4,,,,,,,,,
44640,Butters,1,"Yeah. Why, we sure-uh gave those skanky bitches what for!",4,Southpark,57,10,,,,,,,,,
44642,Kyle,1,"It's good to have you back, Cartman.",4,Southpark,36,7,,,,,,,,,
44643,Stan,1,"Yeah,. We're never gonna take you ass for granted ever again.",4,Southpark,61,11,,,,,,,,,
44644,Cartman,1,"Yeah, and I'm not gonna take my friends for granted ever again.",4,Southpark,63,12,,,,,,,,,
44646,Cartman,1,Do British people count as an ethnicity for hate crimes?,4,Southpark,56,10,,,,,,,,,
44648,Cartman,1,Sweet.,4,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
44651,Cartman,1,"Hey, Romper Stomper.",4,Southpark,20,3,,,,,,,,,
44653,Cartman,1,"Well, that's not all. I snuck something in for you, too.",4,Southpark,56,11,,,,,,,,,
44655,Cartman,1,You know how you told me you always wanted to see Disneyland?,4,Southpark,61,12,,,,,,,,,
44657,Cartman,1,Yeah! That's the Pirates of the Caribbean. Ugh.,4,Southpark,47,8,,,,,,,,,
44659,Cartman,1,Hegh. Oh! Here comes Space Mountain-oh-uugh.  Ogh! Wait-,4,Southpark,56,8,,,,,,,,,
44661,Cartman,1,"Uh, what else?  Splash Mountain, that comes now-oh! ",4,Southpark,52,8,,,,,,,,,
44663,Cartman,2,Mom! MOOOM! Mom!  Seriously! Something wonderful has happened!,4,Southpark,62,8,,,,,,,,,
44665,Cartman,2,"Mom, look! The tooth fairy! I put a tooth under my pillow, and she gave me two dollars!  She's only given me a lousy quarter before!",4,Southpark,132,26,,,,,,,,,
44667,Cartman,2,Yeah! This is so tits!,4,Southpark,22,5,,,,,,,,,
44669,Cartman,2,"Oh, I mean, this is so cool!",4,Southpark,28,7,,,,,,,,,
44671,Cartman,2,"Heh, you can compound daily my ass with interest, Mom; I'm goin' to the toy store and buy me a skateboard! ",4,Southpark,107,21,,,,,,,,,

44680,Stan,2,For one tooth?,4,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,
44681,Cartman,2,For one tooth.,4,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,
44682,Stan,2,"Dude, every time I lost a tooth I only got a quarter.",4,Southpark,53,12,,,,,,,,,
44683,Kyle,2,I only got a jar of gefilte fish.,4,Southpark,33,8,,,,,,,,,
44684,Cartman,2,"Well, that doesn't matter, because I have an idea that is totally tits.",4,Southpark,71,13,,,,,,,,,
44685,Kyle,2,...Totally what?,4,Southpark,16,2,,,,,,,,,
44686,Cartman,2,"Look, I don't know why the tooth fairy's being so cool to me. Maybe she's hot for me. I don't know, but if we all chip in with teeth, then I can hide them under my pillow and we could get enough money to buy a  Sega Dreamcast.",4,Southpark,226,48,,,,,,,,,
44688,Cartman,2,All we need is teeth.,4,Southpark,21,5,,,,,,,,,
44689,Stan,2,I already lost all my baby teeth.,4,Southpark,33,7,,,,,,,,,

44695,Kenny,2,,4,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
44696,Cartman,2,"Alright! Kenny's in, you guys! Tits!",4,Southpark,36,6,,,,,,,,,

44704,Kenny,2,,4,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
44705,Cartman,2,"I'll tell you why it has to be you, Kenny: because your family is poor, and therefore has bad oral hygiene, so your teeth are gonna fall out someday, anyway. If you think about it, you should actually be thanking us.  ""Oh, thank you, guys."" You're welcome, Kenny.",4,Southpark,263,48,,,,,,,,,

45634,Kyle,4,You know something? I think that's good. It was wrong to make Timmy a singer.,4,Southpark,77,15,,,,,,,,,

45667,Chef,4,That does it! That Ritalin has affected your little cracker brains too deeply! I'm going to go see that damn pharmacist!,4,Southpark,120,21,,,,,,,,,
45670,Chef,4,"Hey, open this damn door. ",4,Southpark,26,5,,,,,,,,,

45680,Chef,4,That's right! You've made them so dull and boring that they're actually going to go to a Phil Collins concert!,4,Southpark,110,20,,,,,,,,,
45683,Chef,4,"Well, how do we reverse the Ritalin?!",4,Southpark,37,7,,,,,,,,,
45685,Chef,4,Then we need an antidote!,4,Southpark,25,5,,,,,,,,,
45689,Chef,4,"Alright. Come on, we've got to get the antidote to all the children. Quick! ",4,Southpark,76,14,,,,,,,,,
45691,Chef,4,Here. We can put the Ritalin antidote in these drinks and hand them out to the children. ,4,Southpark,89,17,,,,,,,,,

46946,Kyle,8,"Our main point is that the flag shouldn't offend anyone, because killing has been around since the beginning of time. All animals kill.

46947,Chef,8,Whoa whoa whooaa! You just missed the point entirely!,4,Southpark,53,9,,,,,,,,,
46948,Kyle,8,Huh?,4,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
46949,Chef,8,"I'm not mad because the flag shows somebody gettin' killed, It's because it's racist!",4,Southpark,85,14,,,,,,,,,

46959,Chef,8,"Why, that is- that is the most beautiful thing I have ever heard.",4,Southpark,65,13,,,,,,,,,
46962,Chef,8,"Don't you see? All this time I thought these little crackers had turned racist, when actually they were so not racist that they didn't even make a separation of black and white to begin with. All they saw when they looked at that flag was five people.",4,Southpark,251,47,,,,,,,,,
46965,Kyle,8,Yeah. ,4,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
46966,Chef,8,"I'm sorry, children. I was wrong about you. But I still the flag needs to be changed. But now I realize that I almost let racism turn me into a racist.",4,Southpark,151,31,,,,,,,,,

47151,Cartman,9,So how do boy bands use that?,4,Southpark,29,7,,,,,,,,,
47152,Chef,9,"All they do is make videos, showing tons and tons of girls screaming for the boy band. Once you get girls screaming, you can't stop 'em. They're crazy!  Uh-uh, except for Lilian, of course. ",4,Southpark,190,34,,,,,,,,,

47187,Stan,9,"Dad, I did all my chores. Why can't I play with my friends?",4,Southpark,59,13,,,,,,,,,
47188,Randy,9,"Stanley, it's just that there's better things you could be doing on a Saturday than singing and dancing. You could be watching TV or, laying in bed.",4,Southpark,148,27,,,,,,,,,

47229,Randy,9,...I was... I was 18 when my high-school men's choir performed at the grand opening of a sporting-goods store in Denver.  I was just one of fifteen members and I had no idea that a record producer was in the audience. ,4,Southpark,218,41,,,,,,,,,

47239,Randy,9,"No! Wait. I mean, ah-I'll think about it.",4,Southpark,41,8,,,,,,,,,

47247,Randy,9,"And suddenly there I was, thrown into a group with four other young men who I didn't even know. ",4,Southpark,96,19,,,,,,,,,
47250,Randy,9,"It's obvious to me, girl",4,Southpark,24,5,,,,,,,,,
47251,Randy,9,"The songs were terrible. But believe it or not, the country ate them up. The next thing I knew, we were the biggest thing in the world. ",4,Southpark,136,27,,,,,,,,,
47253,Randy,9,"Now, give it to me, 'cause...",4,Southpark,29,6,,,,,,,,,

47269,Randy,9,Ugh..! ,4,Southpark,7,1,,,,,,,,,
47271,Randy,9,"The only thing I could do was come back to Colorado, and face everyone that I had abandoned.",4,Southpark,92,18,,,,,,,,,

47275,Stan,9,Jesus Christ. ...I never knew.,4,Southpark,30,5,,,,,,,,,
47276,Randy,9,"I didn't want you to know. Because now I'm a joke. Ever since then, I've wished every single day that I could go back to that moment when I was offered the job and say, ""No!"" Because all the fame and the money, the women... All it did was build me up, so that I could be knocked down harder than anybody in the world.  That is what being in a boy band is all about, Stanley.  It's people smothering you and embracing you and loving you and then spitting you out and throwing you away like you were last night's pork chops. Now we wander the Earth in disarray_—”us, New Kids on the Block, the Osmonds... We're all the same. And that... is why you can't go to the mall. ",4,Southpark,668,131,,,,,,,,,
47277,Stan,9,...Oh-kay.,4,Southpark,10,1,,,,,,,,,
47278,Kyle,9,Wow. There must be at least 20 people out there. ,4,Southpark,49,10,,,,,,,,,

47280,Kyle,9,He'll be here. Stan wouldn't douche.,4,Southpark,36,6,,,,,,,,,

47292,Randy,9,"Come here, Stanley.  Stan, it was wrong of me to try and stop you from joining a boy band without explaining why. I've made some mistakes in my life, and now... I have to let you make your own mistakes.",4,Southpark,202,40,,,,,,,,,
47293,Stan,9,Yeah.,4,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
47294,Randy,9,"You know, in a way, I think I was even jealous of you being in a boy band. Isn't that stupid?",4,Southpark,93,21,,,,,,,,,
47295,Stan,9,Not really. Not any more stupid than some of the other stuff you've done.,4,Southpark,73,14,,,,,,,,,
47296,Randy,9,"Well, come on. I'll drive you down to the mall.",4,Southpark,47,10,,,,,,,,,
47297,Stan,9,Really?,4,Southpark,7,1,,,,,,,,,
47298,Randy,9,Yeah. I wanna see what you guys can do. And then we'll go buy you a small toy so that you can forget all about this.,4,Southpark,116,26,,,,,,,,,

47303,Cartman,9,God damnit! People are walking away! ,4,Southpark,37,6,,,,,,,,,

47338,Cartman,9,"I don't know if I can handle all this fame. I mean, I always thought I'd wanna become famous, but now that I am, I don't know if I like it.

48120,Cartman,12,"Everything was great in third grade. And now that it's all over, we're starting to see just how special it was.Remember how it used to be in the Third Grade?We used to laugh and play and cherish each day in the Third GradeWe learned wondrous things from a teacher so niceSat on marshmallow desks with teddy-bear smilesThe world seemed to all make sensebut that sense seems to slowly fadeAfter Third GradeIn the Third Grade we used to write with crayonsWe would make sparkly pictures with glitter and glueWe had warm cookies and hearts full of loveAnd there wasn't a care in the world of me... of you...There's not a thing in this life that I wouldn't trade just to go back, for one minuteTo Third Grade",4,Southpark,702,126,,,,,,,,,

48307,Mr. Garrison,12,"Look, you can't counter a profane command with an idle threat! You must extinguish it with a vulgar suggestion! When a child says, ""Suck my balls,"" you say, ""Present them.""",4,Southpark,172,30,,,,,,,,,

I used to be the third grade teacher, but I had a little  ""nervous breakdown"" and went into the mountains where I lived off of ""rat carcasses"".  But I'm all better now, and the school was nice enough to let me go on teaching, as long as it was for kindergarten.  But it's not a demotion. No. I mean, just because a teacher was teaching third grade and now is teaching kindergarten, that's not a demotion, is it?  No, that's right, it's not. Well, let's start with roll call. Uh, let's see. Filmore Anderson?",4,Southpark,609,111,,,,,,,,,

48447,Cartman,13,And so the other thing that makes my Trapper Keeper cooler than Kyle's is that it can add any peripheral device to itself automatically.  I can take something as simple as this calculator  and... Trapper Keeper?,4,Southpark,211,36,,,,,,,,,

49351,Kyle,16,What's Cuba?,4,Southpark,12,2,,,,,,,,,
49353,Kyle,16,"And do I have to shovel the whole driveway, or just the side the car is on?",4,Southpark,75,17,,,,,,,,,
49355,Kyle,16,"Hoh, geez. ",4,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
49356,Kyle,16,Dear Mr. Castro:  I am an eight-year-old American boy who lives in South Park.,4,Southpark,78,14,,,,,,,,,
49357,Kyle,16,"And if I had just one wish, just one wish in the whole world,If I had one wish it'd be for Cuba to change.Because I think that all the Cubans are in painAll the joy in the world, from sea to shining seaDoesn't mean a thing if Cubans aren't freeI just can't be very happy, that's certainNot as long as your Cubans are hurtin' Oh, won't you search your soul and find a way to change your mind?That is my one and only wish.",4,Southpark,420,84,,,,,,,,,

49366,Kyle,16,But that's not fair! You lied to me!,4,Southpark,36,8,,,,,,,,,
49368,Kyle,16,What I understand is that you totally screwed me over!! So why should I have to listen to you?!,4,Southpark,95,19,,,,,,,,,
49370,Kyle,16,Well I wish I didn't have any parents! ,4,Southpark,39,8,,,,,,,,,
49372,Kyle,16,It's so unfair! How can my parents do that to me?!,4,Southpark,50,11,,,,,,,,,
49373,Stan,16,"Parents can be pretty cruel sometimes, dude. They get off on it.",4,Southpark,64,12,,,,,,,,,
49374,Kyle,16,They're evil! I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE ANY PARENTS!,4,Southpark,47,9,,,,,,,,,

49376,Kyle,16,How?!,4,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
49377,Cartman,16,"Well, I mean, you... could... call the police and have them take your parents away.",4,Southpark,83,15,,,,,,,,,
49378,Stan,16,The police?,4,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
49379,Cartman,16,"Yeah, I saw it on TV. All you gotta do is call the police and say that your parents both molestered you.",4,Southpark,104,22,,,,,,,,,
49380,Kyle,16,What's that?,4,Southpark,12,2,,,,,,,,,
49381,Cartman,16,"I don't know, but it works. When I wanted to get rid of my mom's last boyfriend, I just called the police, and said he was molestering me, and I haven't seen him for three months.",4,Southpark,179,36,,,,,,,,,
49382,Kyle,16,Wow! Three months without parents!,4,Southpark,34,5,,,,,,,,,
49383,Kenny,16,,4,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
49384,Stan,16,But what do the police do to them?,4,Southpark,34,8,,,,,,,,,
49385,Kyle,16,Who cares? My parents deserve whatever they get. They're liars and cheats.,4,Southpark,74,12,,,,,,,,,
49386,Cartman,16,"You have to make it convincing, though, when you call the police. You have to be like,  ""my parents molestered me.""",4,Southpark,115,21,,,,,,,,,
49387,Kyle,16,"""My parents molestered me.""",4,Southpark,27,4,,,,,,,,,
49388,Cartman,16,"No, but you've gotta cry, like this:  ""My parents molestered me.""  And then they'll say something like, ""Was it a good touch or a bad touch?"" and you say  ""Uh, it was a good touch"" or- no wait,  you say it was a bad touch.",4,Southpark,222,45,,,,,,,,,
49389,Kyle,16,"What's ""bad touch""?",4,Southpark,19,3,,,,,,,,,

49409,Kyle,16,...Nothing.,4,Southpark,11,1,,,,,,,,,
49410,Cartman,16,"Yeah, nothing. There's not an adult left in town.  They've all been arrested, and the ones that weren't arrested have moved away because they're scared of being arrested",4,Southpark,169,28,,,,,,,,,
49411,Kyle,16,Not one adult left?,4,Southpark,19,4,,,,,,,,,
49412,Stan,16,...Then it's ours. The whole town. It's ours.,4,Southpark,45,8,,,,,,,,,
49424,Butters,16,"Hoh, hahh, can I- help you folks?",4,Southpark,33,7,,,,,,,,,

49428,Butters,16,"No, uh Craig's here, too.",4,Southpark,25,5,,,,,,,,,
49430,Butters,16,"But he's playing Spaceman right now. Huh. Hey, Craig! ",4,Southpark,54,9,,,,,,,,,
49433,Butters,16,"Huuuhhhh, no.",4,Southpark,13,2,,,,,,,,,
49435,Butters,16,Phone here doesn't work. Haa-I'm afraid the only phone that does work... is over in Treasure Cove.,4,Southpark,98,17,,,,,,,,,
49439,Butters,16,Uhh rrreeally are you sure?,4,Southpark,27,5,,,,,,,,,
49441,Butters,16,"Oh, alright then.  Uh, show 'em where it is.",4,Southpark,44,9,,,,,,,,,
49481,Cartman,16,"Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Cotner. Won't you come in, please?  Mr. and Mrs. Cotner, as the mayor of Smiley Town, I would like to ask you a few questions.",4,Southpark,146,29,,,,,,,,,
49483,Cartman,16,"Parents?  Ah, you mean the birth-givers. They're not around.",4,Southpark,60,9,,,,,,,,,
49485,Cartman,16,"Okay, see, I am the mayor of Smiley Town, and so I will ask the questions around hyah!",4,Southpark,86,18,,,,,,,,,
49487,Cartman,16,"Eheh, I'm afraid you'll find all the phones... quite out of service.",4,Southpark,68,12,,,,,,,,,
49489,Cartman,16,"Butters, I need an ETA on the car, stat. ",4,Southpark,41,9,,,,,,,,,
49492,Cartman,16,"So, it appears that you need me. Which is good, because... I need you, too.  Ringy-ding?",4,Southpark,88,16,,,,,,,,,
49495,Cartman,16,"Aaahh!  You sons of bitches!  You see what we're dealing with here. Tonight is Carousel. And they will try to kill one of us. Eh, you two seem to have the uncanny ability to cross the white line. If you help us, we'll get you what you need. ",4,Southpark,241,48,,,,,,,,,
49512,Stan,16,"You guys, stop it!  Sorry about them. Kindergartners are kind of spazzes.",4,Southpark,73,12,,,,,,,,,
49513,Kyle,16,Yeah. ,4,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
49515,Stan,16,How come you wanna help the fatass?!,4,Southpark,36,7,,,,,,,,,
49517,Kyle,16,The fatass. The mayor.,4,Southpark,22,4,,,,,,,,,
49519,Stan,16,"You got foolied, outlander! We're the only ones with a working phone. And if you had taken our book, then it's one of us who dies tonight at Carousel!",4,Southpark,150,29,,,,,,,,,
49521,Kyle,16,"Because we do. It was like this yesterday, and the day before that.",4,Southpark,67,13,,,,,,,,,
49523,Stan,16,"You mean in the before time? In the long, long ago?",4,Southpark,51,11,,,,,,,,,
49525,Stan,16,"If we tell you, will you help us stop Fatass?",4,Southpark,45,10,,,,,,,,,
49527,Stan,16,Alright. Everybody gather round. We're gonna tell the story of the before time again.,4,Southpark,85,14,,,,,,,,,
49530,Stan,16,"Way back, in the long long ago, we all lived by the birth-givers' laws. But the birth-givers were unfair. They made us go to bed early and eat broccoli. ",4,Southpark,153,29,,,,,,,,,
49532,Stan,16,"And so the fatass came up with a way to have all the birth-givers disappear. , by using the magic M word. ",4,Southpark,106,22,,,,,,,,,
49534,Stan,16,"Soon we were without power, water, or fresh food. But we tried to survive. Under the guidance of... the Provider. ",4,Southpark,114,20,,,,,,,,,
49536,Stan,16,The fatass and us disagreed on how to worship the provider. The fatass tried to make us follow his way by making himself the school principal. So we made ourselves the superintendents of school. But then he just made himself the mayor. The town split sides and that's when the Provider got angry. ,4,Southpark,297,53,,,,,,,,,
49540,Stan,16,"So now, every night, the Provider must be appeased at Carousel. We need their book so one of ours doesn't die. ",4,Southpark,111,21,,,,,,,,,
49542,Stan,16,"We all know that one day, the Provider will set us free. Make everything like it was in the before time. In the long, long ago.",4,Southpark,127,26,,,,,,,,,
49544,Stan,16,Yes. No foolies.,4,Southpark,16,3,,,,,,,,,
49553,Randy,16,"Uh, excuse me, but my wife and I honestly never touched our child.",4,Southpark,66,13,,,,,,,,,
49562,Butters,16,"I think I found the problem, ma'am. A broken window roller-upper.",4,Southpark,65,11,,,,,,,,,
49564,Cartman,16,Where is your husband?,4,Southpark,22,4,,,,,,,,,
49566,Cartman,16,Seize her! ,4,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
49568,Stan,16,Awesu-home!,4,Southpark,11,1,,,,,,,,,
49570,Kyle,16,"Sure, outlander. I'll get it ",4,Southpark,29,5,,,,,,,,,

49573,Butters,16,Oo what the heck are you talkin' about?,4,Southpark,39,8,,,,,,,,,
49574,Cartman,16,"Butters, calm down, alright?",4,Southpark,28,4,,,,,,,,,
49584,Cartman,16,"I believe you have something of ours, outlander! Give it back, or the female gets it! ",4,Southpark,86,16,,,,,,,,,
49586,Cartman,16,"Heh, heheh.",4,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
49589,Stan,16,"No. If they have it, one of ours will die for Carousel!",4,Southpark,55,12,,,,,,,,,
49590,Cartman,16,"We're running out of time! Hand our book over, quick!",4,Southpark,53,10,,,,,,,,,
49592,Cartman,16,The Provider awakes!,4,Southpark,20,3,,,,,,,,,
49593,Stan,16,"It's time for Carousel! Haha, your side doesn't have its book, fatass! That means someone on your side is sacrificed tonight.",4,Southpark,125,21,,,,,,,,,
49594,Cartman,16,"Aw, damnit! Alright.  It is decided.  Butters, your turn. ",4,Southpark,58,9,,,,,,,,,
49595,Butters,16,"Oh, I'm gonna be sacrificed to the Provider!",4,Southpark,44,8,,,,,,,,,
49598,Cartman,16,"Yeah, we'll call the police and say you molestered us, too.",4,Southpark,59,11,,,,,,,,,
49600,Butters,16,"I'm here for you, Provider! Uh, take me! ",4,Southpark,41,8,,,,,,,,,

49607,Stan,16,"He's right, dude. Things were a lot better with our parents around.",4,Southpark,67,12,,,,,,,,,
49608,Kyle,16,Yeah. I guess their rules did have a point. Things have gotten a lot worse in the ten days since they've been gone.,4,Southpark,115,23,,,,,,,,,
49610,Cartman,16,Take him down. ,4,Southpark,15,3,,,,,,,,,
49611,Butters,16,"Hey, uh, what are you doin'?? Ha-I'm ready to give myself to Mr. Elway.",4,Southpark,71,14,,,,,,,,,
49612,Kyle,16,"Here's our cell phone, dude.  Will you call the police for us? ",4,Southpark,63,12,,,,,,,,,
49616,Stan,16,"Come on, you guys! Our parents are gonna be back any minute!",4,Southpark,60,12,,,,,,,,,
49617,Kyle,16,Do you think they're gonna pissed at us for lying that they molested us and sending them all to jail for ten days?,4,Southpark,114,23,,,,,,,,,
49618,Stan,16,"Well, they can't be too pissed off. I mean, we made them a banner.",4,Southpark,66,14,,,,,,,,,
49620,Stan,16,"Hey, you guys came back!",4,Southpark,24,5,,,,,,,,,
49621,Kyle,16,Did you make it to your job interview?,4,Southpark,38,8,,,,,,,,,

49650,Kyle,17,"He's gonna be here any minute, Ike.",4,Southpark,35,7,,,,,,,,,
49652,Kyle,17,"Heee might not come if you're too close to the toilet bowl, Ike.  Come sit by me. ",4,Southpark,82,17,,,,,,,,,

49666,Kyle,17,"It's only three days until Christmas, you guys! You know how bad things have been around here. I think it might be because Mr. Hankey hasn't come.",4,Southpark,146,27,,,,,,,,,
49667,Cartman,17,"Kyle, I have a full day of watching TV tomorrow. I don't have time to go on a poo hunt right now, okay?",4,Southpark,103,23,,,,,,,,,

49676,Kyle,17,But where have you been? Things aren't the same without you. Nobody seems to have the Christmas spirit.,4,Southpark,103,18,,,,,,,,,
49678,Cartman,17,Family?,4,Southpark,7,1,,,,,,,,,
49692,Kyle,17,A family! So THAT's why you haven't been able to spread Christmas cheer.,4,Southpark,72,13,,,,,,,,,

49704,Stan,17,Nobody's paying any attention. ,4,Southpark,31,4,,,,,,,,,
49708,Stan,17,This is hopeless. We're just gonna have to face that the commercialism has been sucked out of Christmas.,4,Southpark,104,18,,,,,,,,,
49716,Stan,17,"Dude, change the channel. This is too depressing. ",4,Southpark,50,8,,,,,,,,,
49718,Cartman,17,"Oh, Jesus, not this thing again.",4,Southpark,32,6,,,,,,,,,

49726,Stan,17,"What, dude?",4,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
49727,Kyle,17,"We can get everyone back into the Christmas spirit by making our very own animated Christmas special, and showing it to everybody in town! ",4,Southpark,139,24,,,,,,,,,
49728,Stan,17,We don't know anything about animation.,4,Southpark,39,6,,,,,,,,,
49729,Kyle,17,How hard can it be? Look at it. ,4,Southpark,32,8,,,,,,,,,

49732,Stan,17,"Yeah! And we can call it... ""The Spirit of Christmas"" ",4,Southpark,54,10,,,,,,,,,
49736,Kyle,17,Mayor! We have the solution to your problem.,4,Southpark,44,8,,,,,,,,,
49738,Kyle,17,We're gonna make a short animated Christmas card that everyone can watch and play it on the screen at the old drive-in.,4,Southpark,119,22,,,,,,,,,
49739,Stan,17,"It'll have everything. Jesus, Santa. And when people see it, they'll just HAVE to get in the spirit. All we need is three hundred dollars for our budget.",4,Southpark,153,28,,,,,,,,,

50097,Mr. Garrison,1,"No! No, Filmore! You can say ""I have to poop and shit,"" or ""Oh, shit, I have to poop,"" but not ""I have to shit."" Are we all clear?",5,Southpark,130,29,,,,,,,,,
50099,Mr. Garrison,1,"Look, it's all about context. Well, for example, recently, I have come out and admitted that I was a homosexual. I'm gay. That means that now I can say the word, ""fag"". On television they usually don't allow ""fag"". But because I'm gay, it's alright. And with the new approval of the word, ""shit,"" that means that finally I am free to say,Hey, there, shitty shitty fag fag,Shitty shitty fag fag, how do you do?Hey, there, shitty shitty fag fag,Shitty shitty fag fag, how do you do? Oh this is great!",5,Southpark,498,91,,,,,,,,,

50122,Cartman,1,"Yeah, they've taken all the fun out of ""shit"". We're gonna have to start saying other bad words, like cock and fuck and... meecrob. ",5,Southpark,132,24,,,,,,,,,
50123,Stan,1,What's meecrob?,5,Southpark,15,2,,,,,,,,,
50124,Cartman,1,"You know, that stuff you get as an appetizer at Thai food restaurants. Meecrob, dude, is way grosser than ""shit"", dude. I'd scarf down a whole wet bucket full of shit before I ate another plate of meecrob. ",5,Southpark,206,38,,,,,,,,,
50125,Kyle,1,"You guys! You guys! I've looked up the word, ""shit""! I think it might have something to do with people dying!",5,Southpark,109,21,,,,,,,,,

50129,Kyle,1,"I am not full of meecro- what? Look, the word ""shit"" first showed up in English in the 1340s, the same time as something called, ""The Black Death"".",5,Southpark,147,28,,,,,,,,,
50130,Stan,1,What's that?,5,Southpark,12,2,,,,,,,,,
50131,Cartman,1,"Kyle, do you still have sand in your vagina about us not going to The Lion King with you?! I mean, shit, dude, let it go.",5,Southpark,121,26,,,,,,,,,
50132,Kyle,1,"Look! It might be a coincidence, but I think we'd better ask someone. Come on! ",5,Southpark,79,15,,,,,,,,,
50149,Chef,1,"Baby you are so fine, and shit!The shit you do, the shit you say; I'd jump on your shit any day! Oh, hello there, children.",5,Southpark,123,25,,,,,,,,,
50151,Kyle,1,"Chef, do you know where ""shit"" comes from?",5,Southpark,42,8,,,,,,,,,
50152,Chef,1,"Uh, from your ass, children.",5,Southpark,28,5,,,,,,,,,
50153,Kyle,1,"No no! The word, ""shit"".",5,Southpark,24,5,,,,,,,,,
50154,Chef,1,Oh.,5,Southpark,3,1,,,,,,,,,
50155,Cartman,1,"Detective Sandy Vagina here  thinks that ""shit"" might have something to do with everyone getting sick.",5,Southpark,102,16,,,,,,,,,
50156,Kyle,1,"Ungh, it said in my book that the word, ""shit"", started exactly the same time as something called, ""The Black Death"".",5,Southpark,117,21,,,,,,,,,
50157,Chef,1,The Black Death? Are you sure?,5,Southpark,30,6,,,,,,,,,
50158,Stan,1,"What's the Black Death, Chef?",5,Southpark,29,5,,,,,,,,,
50159,Chef,1,"LaToya Jackson, children.",5,Southpark,25,3,,,,,,,,,
50161,Chef,1,But I think back in those days it meant something else: the plague!,5,Southpark,67,13,,,,,,,,,
50162,Chef,1,"It says here the word, ""shit"" has been around for over 600 years. It comes from the Anglo-Saxon word, ""skite"".",5,Southpark,110,20,,,,,,,,,
50163,Kyle,1,"Right. But in the 1340s people in England stopped calling it ""skite"" and started calling it ""shit."" The same year as the Black Plague.",5,Southpark,134,24,,,,,,,,,
50165,Chef,1,The Black Plague. Over half of Europe was killed by it.,5,Southpark,55,11,,,,,,,,,
50166,Stan,1,"Look, they're puking out their intestines, just like the people here. ",5,Southpark,70,11,,,,,,,,,
50167,Chef,1,"Look at this, children.  It says that the people in England believed that the plague was a curse, a dark magic infliction brought on by a mass utterance of a word of curse.",5,Southpark,172,33,,,,,,,,,
50168,Stan,1,Word of curse?,5,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,
50169,Kyle,1,A... curse word.,5,Southpark,16,3,,,,,,,,,
50170,Chef,1,"Of course! I've never even thought about why we use the term ""curse word"" before.",5,Southpark,81,15,,,,,,,,,
50171,Stan,1,Because it brings a curse? Like the Black Death.,5,Southpark,48,9,,,,,,,,,
50172,Cartman,1,"You guys, look here.  In this Nancy Drew mystery, Nancy goes to the beach and gets sand trapped in her shoe. This could explain how Kyle got it in his vagina.",5,Southpark,158,31,,,,,,,,,
50173,Kyle,1,"Cartman, this is serious!!!",5,Southpark,27,4,,,,,,,,,
50174,Cartman,1,"So am I, Kyle. If that sand in your vagina doesn't get released, you could become a walking time bomb. ",5,Southpark,103,20,,,,,,,,,
50176,Stan,1,Holy shit!,5,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,
50177,Cartman,1,"Oh-Ho, gross!",5,Southpark,13,2,,,,,,,,,
50178,Kyle,1,"Dude, this plague is spreading like wildfire! ",5,Southpark,46,7,,,,,,,,,
50179,Stan,1,Uh oh.,5,Southpark,6,2,,,,,,,,,
50180,Kenny,1,,5,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
50181,Cartman,1,Kenny's got it. heh heh.,5,Southpark,24,5,,,,,,,,,
50182,Kyle,1,"We've gotta do something, Chef. If we don't we don't stop that network,  ""shit"" will become an even more acceptable word!",5,Southpark,121,21,,,,,,,,,
50183,Chef,1,"Children, we've got to warn those producers in Hollywood that the plague, and ""shit"", could be linked!",5,Southpark,102,17,,,,,,,,,
50185,Cartman,1,"Goddamn it, Kenny! Don't get your plague germs on me!",5,Southpark,53,10,,,,,,,,,
50186,Kyle,1,"Cartman, stop being an asshole! ",5,Southpark,32,5,,,,,,,,,
50193,Chef,1,"Hold on a minute, Mr. Producer!",5,Southpark,31,6,,,,,,,,,
50195,Chef,1,"My name is Chef, and these are the children! We've come to warn you about ""shit"".",5,Southpark,81,16,,,,,,,,,
50200,Chef,1,Hey! Hold on a minute!,5,Southpark,22,5,,,,,,,,,
50202,Chef,1,Haven't you people noticed all the strange things going on?,5,Southpark,59,10,,,,,,,,,
50203,Kyle,1,"We think that you might have could it by helping make ""shit"" an everyday word. ",5,Southpark,79,15,,,,,,,,,
50205,Kyle,1,"It's true. We think that word might be plaguing our friend, Kenny.",5,Southpark,66,12,,,,,,,,,
50207,Kyle,1,...No.,5,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
50209,Cartman,1,"But... we can keep the Halo the Turtle dolls, right?",5,Southpark,52,10,,,,,,,,,
50210,Chef,1,Damn cracker-ass producers!,5,Southpark,27,3,,,,,,,,,
50211,Stan,1,"Now what are we gonna do, Chef?",5,Southpark,31,7,,,,,,,,,
50212,Chef,1,"I don't know, children. I guess we've got to get the word out to people some other way.",5,Southpark,87,18,,,,,,,,,
50214,Stan,1,Oh shit!,5,Southpark,8,2,,,,,,,,,
50226,Chef,1,Who are you?,5,Southpark,12,3,,,,,,,,,
50228,Stan,1,What are we supposed to do with it?,5,Southpark,35,8,,,,,,,,,
50230,Kyle,1,Now what?,5,Southpark,9,2,,,,,,,,,
50231,Chef,1,"We've got to find people who would know what the hell this is all about. Children, we're goin' to have to go to the land of castles, knights, and kings!",5,Southpark,152,30,,,,,,,,,
50234,Chef,1,'Scuse me. Do you work here?,5,Southpark,28,6,,,,,,,,,
50236,Kyle,1,We need some help identifying an ancient English stone.,5,Southpark,55,9,,,,,,,,,
50238,Stan,1,It might hold the key to a curse.,5,Southpark,33,8,,,,,,,,,
50240,Stan,1,"Dude, we need help from the British!",5,Southpark,36,7,,,,,,,,,
50242,Chef,1,We just need help identifying this. ,5,Southpark,36,6,,,,,,,,,
50244,Stan,1,You know what it is?,5,Southpark,20,5,,,,,,,,,
50254,Chef,1,"Uh, yeah. We didn't mean to.",5,Southpark,28,6,,,,,,,,,
50256,Stan,1,"Well, yeah, but I don't think that we knew ""curse word"" meant... curse word.",5,Southpark,76,14,,,,,,,,,
50259,Chef,1,But I don't get it. People use curse words all the time.,5,Southpark,56,12,,,,,,,,,
50262,Chef,1,Knights of Standards and Practices?,5,Southpark,35,5,,,,,,,,,
50266,Randy,1,"Ya know, that word's kind of getting old. It's not really... funny anymore.",5,Southpark,75,13,,,,,,,,,
50268,Mr. Garrison,1,"Well, they can't use ""fag"". Because you can't say ""fag"" unless you're a homosexual.",5,Southpark,83,14,,,,,,,,,
50269,Randy,1,Really? So we can't say ***?,5,Southpark,28,6,,,,,,,,,
50270,Mr. Garrison,1,"No. See, you got beeped.",5,Southpark,24,5,,,,,,,,,
50272,Mr. Garrison,1,That's right.,5,Southpark,13,2,,,,,,,,,
50274,Randy,1,"...Hey, you didn't get beeped.",5,Southpark,30,5,,,,,,,,,
50276,Mr. Garrison,1,"Well, well, well! Guess we learned something new about you, Jimbo, you freakin' fag! You wanna make out or something?",5,Southpark,117,20,,,,,,,,,
50283,Mr. Garrison,1,"Oh boy, this show is really reaching for plot now!",5,Southpark,50,10,,,,,,,,,

50306,Cartman,1,"Oh boy, that thing has really got sand in it's vagina! ",5,Southpark,55,11,,,,,,,,,
50309,Cartman,1,What a stupid voice.,5,Southpark,20,4,,,,,,,,,
50310,Kyle,1,It's okay. The curse has been lifted. ,5,Southpark,38,7,,,,,,,,,
50311,Stan,1,Yeah. We all gotta make sure it doesn't come back.,5,Southpark,50,10,,,,,,,,,
50312,Kyle,1,"You see, we've learned something today. Swearing can be fun, but doing it all the time causes a lot of problems.",5,Southpark,112,21,,,,,,,,,
50313,Kyle,1,We're all saying the S-word too much! ,5,Southpark,38,7,,,,,,,,,
50317,Kyle,1,"The knights of Standards and Practices were created to make sure that bad words were kept to a minimum. ""Curse words"" They're called that because they are a curse. We have to go back to only using curse words in rare, extreme circumstances.",5,Southpark,240,43,,,,,,,,,
50318,Stan,1,"And besides, too much use of a dirty word takes away from its... impact. We believe in free speech and all that, but... keeping a few words taboo just adds to the fun of English.",5,Southpark,178,35,,,,,,,,,
50319,Cartman,1,"So please, everyone, From now on you've got to try and watch your language. ",5,Southpark,76,14,,,,,,,,,

50350,Randy,2,You're the new scout leader?,5,Southpark,28,5,,,,,,,,,
50353,Stan,2,"See ya, Dad!",5,Southpark,12,3,,,,,,,,,
50360,Randy,2,He got to where he is by being a good scout; maybe we should just leave him alone.,5,Southpark,82,18,,,,,,,,,
50364,Randy,2,So he's a homosexual. So what?,5,Southpark,30,6,,,,,,,,,
50367,Randy,2,"Aw, that's ridiculous.",5,Southpark,22,3,,,,,,,,,

50671,Butters,3,"I am prepared.  Hoh, jeez, eh it sure got cold in here.",5,Southpark,55,12,,,,,,,,,
50676,Stan,3,"Kyle, I'm starting to think that this is a really bad idea.",5,Southpark,59,12,,,,,,,,,

50685,Stan,3,"Look at us, dude. These people are trying to change us somehow. I think it's time we went home.",5,Southpark,95,19,,,,,,,,,
50686,Kyle,3,But David Blaine is gonna do more miracles in Denver tomorrow..,5,Southpark,63,11,,,,,,,,,

50689,Stan,3,I'm going home.,5,Southpark,15,3,,,,,,,,,
50691,Stan,3,You said we're free to leave whenever we want,5,Southpark,45,9,,,,,,,,,
50693,Stan,3,Move out of the way.,5,Southpark,20,5,,,,,,,,,
50695,Stan,3,"I don't wanna talk about it, I jus' wanna leave.",5,Southpark,48,10,,,,,,,,,
50697,Stan,3,"That's okay, I... I changed my mind. I'm... gonna stay.",5,Southpark,55,10,,,,,,,,,
50699,Stan,3,"Okay, it's all clear. ",5,Southpark,22,4,,,,,,,,,

50705,Stan,3,A part of what?! Some gaywad magician's crazy life plan?!,5,Southpark,57,10,,,,,,,,,
50706,Kyle,3,Don't call Mr. Blaine a gaywad! He's a brilliant man.,5,Southpark,53,10,,,,,,,,,
50707,Stan,3,"No, they've just convinced you that he's a brilliant man! Let's go!",5,Southpark,67,12,,,,,,,,,
50708,Kyle,3,I'm not going anywhere!,5,Southpark,23,4,,,,,,,,,
50709,Stan,3,"Goddamnit, I'm not going with you! I wanna stay here!",5,Southpark,53,10,,,,,,,,,
50710,Kyle,3,Huh? I thought you wanted to leave.,5,Southpark,35,7,,,,,,,,,
50711,Stan,3,"Oh wait, who am I again?",5,Southpark,24,6,,,,,,,,,
50712,Kyle,3,You're Stan.,5,Southpark,12,2,,,,,,,,,

50715,Stan,3,"Kyle, please. You-  You're my best friend.",5,Southpark,42,7,,,,,,,,,
50716,Kyle,3,"Well, this is what I believe in now, Stan. And if you can't respect that,... then I guess we're not best friends anymore. ",5,Southpark,122,23,,,,,,,,,
50717,Kyle,3,"Hello, ma'am. My name is Kyle. And this is Cartman. We'd like to share our interest in David Blaine with you.",5,Southpark,109,21,,,,,,,,,
50719,Cartman,3,"Uh it... doesn't matter, ma'am. Blaintology is for everyone. There are Blaintologists who are Catholics, Buddhists - why even Kyle here is a Goddamn Jew.",5,Southpark,153,25,,,,,,,,,
50720,Kyle,3,That's right.,5,Southpark,13,2,,,,,,,,,
50722,Cartman,3,"Of course, no. David Blaine is a real person. You may have seen his television specials on ABC. He also wrote a book, and we'd like to share it with you.",5,Southpark,153,31,,,,,,,,,
50724,Cartman,3,Cool. ,5,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
50725,Kyle,3,"...And if you look here, you can see how David Blaine performed the miracle of being frozen in ice at Times Square.",5,Southpark,115,22,,,,,,,,,
50726,Cartman,3,"Ma'am, have you ever wondered what David Blaine's plan is for you?",5,Southpark,66,12,,,,,,,,,
50728,Cartman,3,"Oh, you see, that, that's interesting because... I'm so thankful for David Blaine's book, and, I'm so thankful that he showed me the way to true happiness but, I think about his plan often.",5,Southpark,189,34,,,,,,,,,
50729,Kyle,3,David Blaine is doing a big performance in Denver tomorrow night.  We're sure his magic will entertain and astound you!,5,Southpark,119,20,,,,,,,,,
50730,Cartman,3,He's going to eat his own head.,5,Southpark,31,7,,,,,,,,,
50731,Kyle,3,How many tickets can we put you down for?,5,Southpark,41,9,,,,,,,,,
50733,Cartman,3,"Oh, come on, it'll make you a happy person.",5,Southpark,43,9,,,,,,,,,
50735,Cartman,3,No you're not.,5,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,
50737,Cartman,3,No you're not.,5,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,

50741,Cartman,3,No you're not.,5,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,
50743,Kyle,3,Great!,5,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
50744,Kyle,3,That's 15 people we got to agree to come see David Blaine perform in Denver.,5,Southpark,76,15,,,,,,,,,
50745,Cartman,3,"Yes, Brother Kyle hmm, but our work is not over. We must still recruit ten more audience members in order to get the prize.",5,Southpark,123,24,,,,,,,,,
50746,Kyle,3,"I think if we try Kenny's neighborhood, we might find a- ",5,Southpark,57,11,,,,,,,,,
50747,Cartman,3,"Come, Brother Kyle, we have no time for him. ",5,Southpark,45,9,,,,,,,,,
50748,Stan,3,HaaAAAA! ,5,Southpark,9,1,,,,,,,,,
50750,Stan,3,"Hi, Jesus. It's me,",5,Southpark,19,4,,,,,,,,,
50753,Stan,3,This guy is going around doing magic tricks and saying they're miracles! My friend Kyle thinks he's totally awesome!,5,Southpark,116,19,,,,,,,,,
50755,Stan,3,"I read in the Bible that you did miracles, too. If you could go in front of these people and do your miracles, then, they'll all see that David Blaine isn't so special.",5,Southpark,168,33,,,,,,,,,
50757,Stan,3,Can you do it again?,5,Southpark,20,5,,,,,,,,,
50759,Stan,3,That's it? That's how you did that trick?,5,Southpark,41,8,,,,,,,,,
50761,Stan,3,"That trick sucks, Jesus.",5,Southpark,24,4,,,,,,,,,
50763,Stan,3,"Dude, we have to do something. This guy is performing more miracles in Denver tonight. He's gonna get more followers, and it'll be impossible for me to get Kyle out.",5,Southpark,165,30,,,,,,,,,
50765,Stan,3,"But dude, I'd I don't think you should do that lame water-to-wine trick.",5,Southpark,72,13,,,,,,,,,
50767,Kyle,3,This is a really good turnout.,5,Southpark,30,6,,,,,,,,,
50771,Kyle,3,"Dude, no way! ",5,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,
50775,Cartman,3,What's he doin' here? ,5,Southpark,22,4,,,,,,,,,
50777,Cartman,3,Now how the hell did he do that? ,5,Southpark,33,8,,,,,,,,,
50787,Stan,3,Then what are we going to do.,5,Southpark,29,7,,,,,,,,,
50789,Stan,3,Super best friends?,5,Southpark,19,3,,,,,,,,,
50794,Stan,3,To where?,5,Southpark,9,2,,,,,,,,,
50796,Stan,3,I am ready.,5,Southpark,11,3,,,,,,,,,
50798,Stan,3,Yeah.,5,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
50800,Kyle,3,"Congratulations, sister. You have heard the noble truth and are now a Blaintologist.",5,Southpark,84,13,,,,,,,,,
50803,Kyle,3,Yeah. Why is that good news?,5,Southpark,28,6,,,,,,,,,
50805,Kyle,3,Mass suicide?,5,Southpark,13,2,,,,,,,,,
50809,Cartman,3,"Did you hear that, guys? We're finally gonna die!",5,Southpark,49,9,,,,,,,,,
50814,Stan,3,"So you mean to tell me that even though people fight and argue over different religions, you guys are all actually friends?",5,Southpark,123,22,,,,,,,,,
50817,Stan,3,Wow.,5,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
50824,Kyle,3,"Cartman! Cartman, wake up! Cartman!",5,Southpark,35,5,,,,,,,,,
50825,Cartman,3,"No, Paula Poundstone! Leave me alone! Eyuh! Uh? ",5,Southpark,48,8,,,,,,,,,
50826,Kyle,3,It's just me.,5,Southpark,13,3,,,,,,,,,
50827,Cartman,3,Brother Kyle? Why do you disturb my rest?,5,Southpark,41,8,,,,,,,,,
50828,Kyle,3,Dude. I don't think I wanna be a part of this anymore.,5,Southpark,54,12,,,,,,,,,
50829,Cartman,3,What?,5,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
50830,Kyle,3,"I think Stan might've been right. Anyway, I think it's going too far. I mean, if I kill myself, it's gonna make my family really sad.",5,Southpark,133,26,,,,,,,,,
50831,Cartman,3,"Yeah, I know what you mean. I don't wanna die either.  I haven't even gotten my pubes yet.",5,Southpark,90,18,,,,,,,,,
50832,Kyle,3,"I think we should bail. If we leave the group, maybe other people will get the courage to leave, too.",5,Southpark,101,20,,,,,,,,,
50833,Cartman,3,"That co- ugh.  That could be difficult, Brother Kyle. But alright, listen: Why don't we sleep on it? If we decide to leave the faction, we can... do it in the morning.",5,Southpark,167,32,,,,,,,,,
50834,Kyle,3,"Okay. Okay, you're right.  Oh uh Cartman: thanks.  Cartman?  What the hell? ",5,Southpark,76,12,,,,,,,,,
50835,Cartman,3,I told on yoo-ou. I told on yoo-ou.,5,Southpark,35,8,,,,,,,,,
50836,Kyle,3,"What have you done, Cartman?!",5,Southpark,29,5,,,,,,,,,
50837,Cartman,3,"This is for your own good, Brother Kyle.",5,Southpark,40,8,,,,,,,,,
50839,Cartman,3,"Ah, and you know what else Kyle said? Um Kyyyle, he said that if we were all gonna commit suicide, that he wouldn't do iiit.",5,Southpark,124,25,,,,,,,,,
50840,Kyle,3,"Cartman, you fatass tattle-tale!",5,Southpark,32,4,,,,,,,,,
50841,Cartman,3,At least I'm not the boy in the plastic bubble!,5,Southpark,47,10,,,,,,,,,
50845,Stan,3,I knew it.,5,Southpark,10,3,,,,,,,,,
50850,Stan,3,"Wow, the Moses.",5,Southpark,15,3,,,,,,,,,
50866,Cartman,3,"Alright, Brother Kyle, it is time for us to die! ",5,Southpark,49,10,,,,,,,,,
50867,Kyle,3,"Cartman! We've been brainwashed, don't you see? We don't have to do this!",5,Southpark,73,13,,,,,,,,,
50868,Cartman,3,But it's the only way for us to be happy. ,5,Southpark,42,10,,,,,,,,,
50869,Kyle,3,"Cartman, no!",5,Southpark,12,2,,,,,,,,,

50888,Kyle,3,You bastards! ,5,Southpark,14,2,,,,,,,,,
50889,Stan,3,"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!",5,Southpark,32,6,,,,,,,,,

50922,Kyle,3,Wagh. ,5,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
50924,Cartman,3,"Hey, I was just about to do it.",5,Southpark,31,8,,,,,,,,,
50934,Stan,3,"Listen up, everyone!  You don't need David Blaine to tell you how to live. See, cults are dangerous because they promise you hope, happiness and, maybe even an afterlife. But in return, they demand you pay money. Any religion that requires you to pay money in order to move up and... learn its tenets is wrong. See, all religions have something valuable to teach, but, just like the Super Best Friends learned, it requires a little bit of them all.",5,Southpark,448,80,,,,,,,,,
50936,Kyle,3,Thanks for saving us Stan. You're my Super Best Friend.,5,Southpark,55,10,,,,,,,,,
50937,Stan,3,"Your my Super Best Friend too, Kyle.",5,Southpark,36,7,,,,,,,,,

50944,Kyle,4,"What the hell are you so happy about, fatass?! ",5,Southpark,47,9,,,,,,,,,
50945,Cartman,4,"Oh, nothing. No big deal, really.",5,Southpark,33,6,,,,,,,,,
50946,Stan,4,What's no big deal?,5,Southpark,19,4,,,,,,,,,
50947,Cartman,4,"Well, guys, it seems that I am the first one of us to reach manhood after all.",5,Southpark,78,17,,,,,,,,,
50948,Kyle,4,...What the hell are you talking about?!,5,Southpark,40,7,,,,,,,,,
50949,Cartman,4,"Well, because, unlike you guys, I just got my first pubes! Ayada da daa, yadadadadee! ",5,Southpark,86,15,,,,,,,,,
50950,Kenny,4,,5,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
50951,Kyle,4,"What's ""pubes""?",5,Southpark,15,2,,,,,,,,,
50952,Stan,4,Pubic hair. He's saying he got his first pubic hair.,5,Southpark,52,10,,,,,,,,,
50953,Kyle,4,Oh.  No you didn't!,5,Southpark,19,4,,,,,,,,,
50954,Cartman,4,Oh yes I did! I'm becoming a man!,5,Southpark,33,8,,,,,,,,,
50955,Stan,4,He's lying. ,5,Southpark,12,2,,,,,,,,,
50956,Cartman,4,You wanna see 'em?,5,Southpark,18,4,,,,,,,,,
50957,Kyle,4,Hell no! ,5,Southpark,9,2,,,,,,,,,
50958,Cartman,4,"Here, check 'em out.",5,Southpark,20,4,,,,,,,,,
50959,Stan,4,"We don't wanna see them, Cartman! ",5,Southpark,34,6,,,,,,,,,
50960,Cartman,4,"There, see?! How do you like them apples!  HA!",5,Southpark,46,9,,,,,,,,,
50961,Kyle,4,Uh what are those? ,5,Southpark,19,4,,,,,,,,,
50962,Cartman,4,My pubes.,5,Southpark,9,2,,,,,,,,,

50965,Kyle,4,Scott Tenorman? The ninth grader?,5,Southpark,33,5,,,,,,,,,
50966,Cartman,4,Yup. He let me have 'em for just ten bucks. Ha ha ha! I got pubes 'fore you guys did! I got pubes 'fore youuu guys! Ahahahahahahaa ha! ,5,Southpark,135,28,,,,,,,,,
50967,Stan,4,"Cartman, you are so goddamned stupid, it's unbelievable.",5,Southpark,56,8,,,,,,,,,
50968,Cartman,4,"Don't be jealous, guys.  This doesn't mean we can't still hang out.  It just means that I matured faster than you.  You'll get your pubes guys, someday.",5,Southpark,152,27,,,,,,,,,
50969,Kyle,4,"Cartman, you don't buy pubes, you grow them yourself!",5,Southpark,53,9,,,,,,,,,
50970,Cartman,4,Uh oo what?,5,Southpark,11,3,,,,,,,,,
50971,Stan,4,"When you get old enough, you grow your own pubic hair that's attached to you, you fuckin' dumbass!",5,Southpark,98,18,,,,,,,,,
50972,Cartman,4,Nuh uh!,5,Southpark,7,2,,,,,,,,,
50973,Kyle,4,Yuh huh!,5,Southpark,8,2,,,,,,,,,
50974,Cartman,4,But then why would Scott Tenorman sell me his pubes for ten dollars?,5,Southpark,68,13,,,,,,,,,
50975,Kyle,4,"Because, retard, you're dumb enough to buy Scott Tenorman's pubes for ten dollars!",5,Southpark,82,13,,,,,,,,,
50976,Cartman,4,You're telling me these pubes are worth nothing.,5,Southpark,48,8,,,,,,,,,
50977,Kyle,4,Yeah.,5,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
50978,Cartman,4,Huh I'm gonna get that son-of-a-bitch.,5,Southpark,38,6,,,,,,,,,
50982,Cartman,4,"Uh, yes, I've come to return these pubes that I purchased, please?",5,Southpark,66,12,,,,,,,,,
50984,Cartman,4,"Right, but you see, I didn't realize, when I bought these pubes from you, that you were full of shit! So you can either give me back my ten dollars, or I can go tell my mom on you!",5,Southpark,180,39,,,,,,,,,
50986,Cartman,4,Just give me back my money...,5,Southpark,29,6,,,,,,,,,
50988,Cartman,4,"Gimme my ten dollars, Scott!",5,Southpark,28,5,,,,,,,,,
50990,Cartman,4,"Hello, sir, my name is KrisKristofferson. I'm with the IRS. I'm here to collect ten dollars that you own in back taxes.",5,Southpark,119,22,,,,,,,,,

50996,Cartman,4,"Oh. Uh, lessee.  I only got six dollars and twelve cents.",5,Southpark,57,11,,,,,,,,,

51015,Cartman,4,"O-kay, and how much is that in pubes?",5,Southpark,37,8,,,,,,,,,
51017,Cartman,4,"Listen, my money is as good as anybody's! Don't you, uh, discriminate against my people by not accepting these pubes.",5,Southpark,117,20,,,,,,,,,
51019,Cartman,4,Racist! ,5,Southpark,8,1,,,,,,,,,

51096,Cartman,4,"Oh, right. Why should we care?  Yes, why should we care? Indeed, eh. Let's just let Scott Tenorman walk away with my sixteen dollars and twelve cents. Hell, let's let all the Scott Tenormans of the world take what's ours and laugh in our faces. Why stand up for yourselves when you can just walk out of here right now and say, ""It's not your problem."" But... years from now, when you're old and have children of your own, what would you give to come back and fight this one day? This one day, when you could have made a difference! Where you could have told Scott Tenorman, ""You may take our pride, but you'll never take my Goddamned sixteen dollars and twelve cents!!""  Now who's with me?!! ",5,Southpark,692,128,,,,,,,,,

51148,Cartman,4,"That's an interesting question, Kurt. But first I'd just like to say that I really hate this kid named Scott Tenorman. He's stupid.  Yeah, I hate Scott Tenorman too.  I think all the guys in the band hate him, right guys?",5,Southpark,221,41,,,,,,,,,
51149,Cartman,4,"Oh, Jesus, did you hear that, Scott? ",5,Southpark,37,7,,,,,,,,,

51166,Stan,4,Yeah.,5,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
51167,Cartman,4,"So, I realized, 'What if we got Radiohead to come here to South Park?' right? Then they could meet Scott Tenorman _—” and _—” see him get his wiener bitten off by a pony! ",5,Southpark,171,34,,,,,,,,,
51168,Kyle,4,...What?,5,Southpark,8,1,,,,,,,,,
51169,Cartman,4,"Don't you see? If I can get this pony to bite off Scott's wiener in front of Radiohead, then Scott would cry. And if Scott cries, then Radiohead will say Scott Tenorman is totally not cool! And that would make Scott Tenorman wanna die!!  Okay, I'll keep working on the pony, you guys go get Radiohead to play here! Ready? Break!! ",5,Southpark,330,61,,,,,,,,,

51247,Cartman,4,What? You mean about how you put pubes in your chili? ,5,Southpark,54,11,,,,,,,,,
51249,Cartman,4,"Yehes, I'm afraid this isn't your chili, Scott. I switched it with Chef's.  It's delicious, Chef. I hadn't planned on that. What I did plan on, however, was that my friends, Stan and Kyle, would betray me and warn you that the Chili Con Carnival was a trap.  I assumed that they would tell you that I had trained Denkins' pony to bite off your wiener. What they didn't tell you was that Denkins is a crazy redneck who shoots trespassers on sight. Knowing that you would try and do something to the pony, I warned Mr. Denkins that violent pony killers were in the area.  I also know that you wouldn't go yourself, for fear of having your wiener bitten off. You would most likely send your parents.  And, I'm afraid that when Mr. Denkins spotted them on his property, he shot and killed both your parents. ",5,Southpark,804,148,,,,,,,,,
51252,Cartman,4,"I came just in time to see Mr. Denkins giving his report to Officer Barbrady. And of course, to steal the bodies...  After a night with the hacksaw, I was all ready to put on my Chili Con Carnival, so that I could tell you personally about your parents' demise! And of course, feed you your chili.  Do you like it? Do you like it, Scott?  I call it, ""Mr. & Mrs. Tenorman Chili.""",5,Southpark,378,74,,,,,,,,,
51254,Cartman,4,Nyahnyahnyahnyah nyah nyah! I made you eat your parents! Nyahnyahnyahnyah nyah nyah! ,5,Southpark,85,12,,,,,,,,,

51672,Stan,6,"Come on, we gotta see what Cartman is doing with his money. ",5,Southpark,60,12,,,,,,,,,
51673,Kyle,6,Why? How could you do this? There are people starving in Alabama and... and you give Cartman a million dollars?,5,Southpark,111,20,,,,,,,,,
51676,Cartman,6,"My own amusement park, Mother. I'm sure.",5,Southpark,40,7,,,,,,,,,
51680,Cartman,6,What?!,5,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
51684,Cartman,6,"Oh, but I'm not buying the park to get people to come.",5,Southpark,54,12,,,,,,,,,
51686,Cartman,6,"No no! I'm buying it to keep people out!  Don't you see? Forever it has been my dream to have my very own theme park, so that I could be alone in it, all day, every day. I love theme parks.  But the lines! Everywhere you go, people, crowds,  The rides are great, but...  All the lines, lines, LINES!  If there's one thing I hate,  all the lines, lines, lines, LINES!!  And then there get to be so many people  that they make FastPass.  So then there's lines for FastPass.  You stand in line to get a ticket to stand in line later. Then there's lines for the bathrooms , lines for the drinks , lines for cantakuras  and rare Kartankulas Plinks!  ...And, so you see, this park is for me. Nobody else will be allowed in it.",5,Southpark,720,138,,,,,,,,,

I couldn't even sit down, so... I, I had to tell my mother, which, which was humiliating. She took me to the doctor, which was more humiliating, a- a- nd he told me. I-I have a hemorrhoid. It's like an infected blood vessel on your ass. I'm nine years old, and I have a hemorrhoid, Stan. I have a hemorrhoid, and, Cartman has his own theme park.",5,Southpark,529,105,,,,,,,,,
51692,Stan,6,"Kyle, I, I understand what you mean, but--",5,Southpark,42,8,,,,,,,,,
51693,Kyle,6,"Do you?! Do you, Stan?! Because all my life I was raised to believe in Jehovah! To believe that we should all behave a certain way and good things will come to us. I make mistakes, but every week I try to better myself. I'm always saying, ""You know, I learned something today..."" and what does this so-called God give me in return? A hemorrhoid. He doesn't make sense!  What is your logic?!  Ow. ",5,Southpark,396,74,,,,,,,,,
51694,Stan,6,"Look. Cartman... he thinks he's gonna be happy because he has his own amusement park, but, he's gonna find out that without other people, the rides are totally lame. I mean, who could really have fun by themselves at a theme park? I'll bet he's sick of it already.",5,Southpark,264,49,,,,,,,,,
51695,Cartman,6,"Yyeessss! Yyeessss!  Awesome!  Ho ho!  Sweet!  Yes!

51744,Kyle,6,"Oh, I'm swell, Stan. I popped my hemorrhoid trying to climb the fence into Cartmanland, and it got infected. I really need to go to the bathroom, but if I do, it will pop again and the pain will make me pass out. How are you?",5,Southpark,225,46,,,,,,,,,
51745,Stan,6,"Well um, ah-I found out that Cartman is letting a few people each day into his theme park. I was thinking we could put on disguises and get in.",5,Southpark,143,29,,,,,,,,,
51747,Stan,6,Jesus.,5,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
51748,Kyle,6,"But it's okay, Stan, because I finally figured it out. You see, if someone like Cartman can get a million dollars and his own theme park, then there is no God. There's no God, dude.",5,Southpark,181,35,,,,,,,,,
51750,Kyle,6,"Why? Why, Mom? Because if I do something bad will happen to me? Because if I do your God might not shower me with his blessings of infected hemorrhoids?",5,Southpark,152,29,,,,,,,,,
51752,Kyle,6,No! I finally do understand! There is no justice! There is no God! Do you hear me?! I renounce my faith!!,5,Southpark,105,21,,,,,,,,,

51775,Cartman,6,"Alright folks, we've had another change in policy. I've had to hire a maintenance person, and to pay his salary I have to let in two more people a day.  However, the stupid maintenance worker demanded I have food and drinks inside the park, so now I've had to hire a beverage person, and a cotton-candy person, which means I now have to let eight people come in a day! BUT, you are to try your best not to ride any rides that I am on! Understood?  Alright, let's go. ",5,Southpark,467,90,,,,,,,,,
51777,Cartman,6,Wait a minute! Who are you?,5,Southpark,27,6,,,,,,,,,

51792,Kyle,6,I've had enough of the Bible. What has it gotten me?,5,Southpark,52,11,,,,,,,,,
51797,Kyle,6,Satan talked to God?,5,Southpark,20,4,,,,,,,,,
51808,Kyle,6,And that's it? That's the end?,5,Southpark,30,6,,,,,,,,,
51810,Kyle,6,That's the most horrible story I've ever heard. Why would God do such a horrible thing to a good person just to prove a point to Satan?,5,Southpark,135,27,,,,,,,,,
51812,Kyle,6,"Then I was right. Job has all his children killed, and Michael Bay gets to keep making movies. There isn't a God.",5,Southpark,113,22,,,,,,,,,

53024,Butters,10,No! That's just what I look like. See?,5,Southpark,38,8,,,,,,,,,
53026,Butters,10,"I'm not makin' a face, mom!",5,Southpark,27,6,,,,,,,,,

53031,Butters,10,Another week?  I hate my stupid face.,5,Southpark,37,7,,,,,,,,,
53033,Cartman,10,"Mr. Mackey, is it possible that you can see something so funny that it ruins your sense of humor forever?",5,Southpark,105,20,,,,,,,,,
53035,Cartman,10,Two people with asses for heads. Ever since I saw them I can't laugh at anything.,5,Southpark,81,16,,,,,,,,,
53037,Cartman,10,"You know, all the usual stuff. Dirty jokes, funny movies, seeing someone die...  This morning, I even saw a little girl get her fingers caught in a car door and... I couldn't laugh. I mean I... I knew it was funny, but I couldn't laugh.",5,Southpark,236,45,,,,,,,,,
53039,Cartman,10,So does that mean I'll never laugh again?,5,Southpark,41,8,,,,,,,,,
53041,Cartman,10,Ugh.,5,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,

53104,Cartman,10,"Jimmy, you've always been my favorite standup comic. You've gotta help me. I've lost my sense of humor.",5,Southpark,103,18,,,,,,,,,
53106,Cartman,10,I just have to find my funny bone again! Just try and make me laugh.,5,Southpark,68,15,,,,,,,,,
53108,Cartman,10,"Okay, let me have it.",5,Southpark,21,5,,,,,,,,,

53145,Stan,10,Why are you wearing a paper bag on your head?,5,Southpark,45,10,,,,,,,,,
53146,Butters,10,"Uh, my parents are makin' me wear this paper bag until I learn... to stop makin' silly faces all the time. They've really had it up to  here with me.",5,Southpark,149,30,,,,,,,,,
53148,Butters,10,"I sure am, Dad!",5,Southpark,15,4,,,,,,,,,
53150,Butters,10,"Thanks, Dad! Ah I'm sorry I was bad-",5,Southpark,36,8,,,,,,,,,

53157,Kyle,10,"Dude, that poor kid. ",5,Southpark,21,4,,,,,,,,,
53159,Cartman,10,"Dear Mom: I can no longer stand to be without a sense of humor. Without laughter, the world is a cold and sad place, and I can't go out to face it anymore. Please tell everyone why I won't be at school.",5,Southpark,202,42,,,,,,,,,
53160,Cartman,10,And please buy me more chocolate guns. I'm starting to run out.,5,Southpark,63,12,,,,,,,,,
53161,Cartman,10,Please get the kind with marshmallow inside. I don't like the peanut-butter filled one.Eric.,5,Southpark,92,14,,,,,,,,,
53168,Cartman,10,What's goin' on?,5,Southpark,16,3,,,,,,,,,
53169,Stan,10,"Dude, the ass-faces' son is Ben Affleck!",5,Southpark,40,7,,,,,,,,,
53172,Mr. Garrison,10,"Wow, I never realized Ben had TPS, but I definitely see the resemblance now. ",5,Southpark,77,14,,,,,,,,,
53176,Kyle,10,"Well, looks like everything turned out alright for them.",5,Southpark,56,9,,,,,,,,,
53177,Cartman,10,"Yeah, I guess now we'll have to call him Ben Assfleck.  Ben Assfleck, say that's funny.",5,Southpark,87,16,,,,,,,,,
53178,Stan,10,"Hey, you're laughing, Cartman.",5,Southpark,30,4,,,,,,,,,

53182,Kyle,10,Everything turned out okay for those people. And so now you can laugh.,5,Southpark,70,13,,,,,,,,,
53183,Stan,10,Huh?,5,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
53184,Kyle,10,"When Cartman first opened the door, and saw the Thompsons, he felt bad for playing a joke on them. Now that everything's turned out alright, he's able to laugh.",5,Southpark,160,29,,,,,,,,,
53185,Stan,10,"Oh, you're right. Cartman had a feeling of remorse.",5,Southpark,51,9,,,,,,,,,
53186,Cartman,10,"E-heh. No no no, I blew a funny fuse.",5,Southpark,37,9,,,,,,,,,
53187,Kyle,10,"There is no such thing as a funny fuse, Cartman. You felt bad.",5,Southpark,62,13,,,,,,,,,
53188,Cartman,10,"Whatever. All I know is that I can laugh again. I'm gonna go home and eat another chocolate gun. Come on, Kenny! ",5,Southpark,113,22,,,,,,,,,
53190,Stan,10,"Wow, Cartman actually felt bad for somebody and couldn't laugh at them.",5,Southpark,71,12,,,,,,,,,
53191,Kyle,10,"Our little man is growing up, Stan. He's growing up.",5,Southpark,52,10,,,,,,,,,
53192,Stan,10,"Yeah, I guess we all are. Maybe things are finally gonna start getting a more sophisticated around here.",5,Southpark,104,18,,,,,,,,,
53194,Mr. Garrison,11,"Jesus Christ, these lines are ridiculous! I'm gonna miss my flight!  E- Excuse me, there are two other security checkpoints. Why can't you open those, too?",5,Southpark,155,26,,,,,,,,,

53217,Mr. Garrison,11,"Oh, I feel like I've run a marathon. ",5,Southpark,37,8,,,,,,,,,
53219,Mr. Garrison,11,"What? Well of course I didn't make it. The line to check in was two hours long, and the security line was two hours more!",5,Southpark,121,25,,,,,,,,,
53221,Mr. Garrison,11,"I can't go tomorrow, the Jizzfest is tonight!",5,Southpark,45,8,,,,,,,,,
53223,Mr. Garrison,11,"This is unbelievable! You know, I seem to remember when the airlines said, ""We need a 15 billion dollar bailout from the taxpayers-""!",5,Southpark,133,23,,,,,,,,,
53225,Mr. Garrison,11,Well we gave them the 15 billion dollar bailout and they fired their employees anyway! So now we have three people to clear 400 passengers!,5,Southpark,139,25,,,,,,,,,
53229,Mr. Garrison,11,"So where did that money go? I'll tell you where it went: it went into the pockets of the presidents and CEOs of the airlines, so they can keep their multimillion dollar salaries!",5,Southpark,178,33,,,,,,,,,
53232,Mr. Garrison,11,"You think you can treat us however you want because we HAVE to fly! Well I'll tell you what, Sally Sassalot, I'm gonna come up with a NEW mode of transportation! A ahah brand new vehicle that'll put all you bastards out of business!",5,Southpark,232,44,,,,,,,,,
53234,Mr. Garrison,11,"You think I can't do it?! I got a master's degree in mechanical engineering at Denver Community College! You watch me!!  Come on, everybody!",5,Southpark,140,24,,,,,,,,,
53238,Kyle,11,"Oh, uh, wawawhat is this?",5,Southpark,25,5,,,,,,,,,
53240,Kyle,11,"Oh is, is this beef?",5,Southpark,20,5,,,,,,,,,
53242,Kyle,11,"Uha, wa, actually, I- I can't eat beef. I have a degenerative problem with my intestinal lining, and beef really gives me gaass.",5,Southpark,128,23,,,,,,,,,
53244,Kyle,11,"Oh no, I d- I don't want to be a bother, I uh-",5,Southpark,46,13,,,,,,,,,
53246,Kyle,11,"We-ull, some fish would be great if it isn't too much trouble.",5,Southpark,62,12,,,,,,,,,
53263,Kyle,11,"What's this comforter filled with? Um, it isn't filled with down, is it?",5,Southpark,72,13,,,,,,,,,
53265,Kyle,11,"Ih it sure is quiet up here in the mountains and it's dry, too. Do you have a humidi-humidifier?",5,Southpark,96,19,,,,,,,,,
53267,Kyle,11,"Uh, can you take my stupid glasses and put them on the night stand. Make sure they're close by, because that fish upset my stomach and I might need them if I have to go to he bathroom later on.",5,Southpark,193,40,,,,,,,,,
53269,Mr. Garrison,11,"Now it's got to be simple. Like a moped, but with the ability to travel at much faster speeds. The designs of our electrical moped were altered with a- no, nonono this won't work either!",5,Southpark,186,35,,,,,,,,,
53271,Mr. Garrison,11,"It has to be more stable, Mr. Hat! A moped would be too dangerous at those speeds. Damnit!  Now, what if the jet power of an aircraft could be scaled down into a personal vehicle?",5,Southpark,179,35,,,,,,,,,
53274,Mr. Garrison,11,"Oh, Mr. Hat! Would you stop drooling over Enrique Iglesias and... wait a minute. What did you say?",5,Southpark,98,18,,,,,,,,,
53276,Mr. Garrison,11,That's it. Gyration.  A gyroscope.  It would allow for maximum balance and yet... Mr. Hat! You're a genius!  It's so simple and yet genius!,5,Southpark,139,24,,,,,,,,,
53278,Stan,11,Hey dude.,5,Southpark,9,2,,,,,,,,,
53279,Cartman,11,What's that thing?,5,Southpark,18,3,,,,,,,,,
53281,Kyle,11,"Hello, I'm Kyle's cousin Kyle.",5,Southpark,30,5,,,,,,,,,

53287,Cartman,11,"Alright, alright.",5,Southpark,17,2,,,,,,,,,
53289,Cartman,11,"Aw, Jesus, why don't you just cut off my balls?",5,Southpark,47,10,,,,,,,,,
53291,Kyle,11,I can't believe how cold it is out here.,5,Southpark,40,9,,,,,,,,,
53292,Cartman,11,Could be tough. But I'll give it a shot.,5,Southpark,40,9,,,,,,,,,
53294,Kyle,11,It's a really dry cold; that's the problem. It- the cold air makes me wheeze.,5,Southpark,77,15,,,,,,,,,
53296,Kyle,11,"Ot- Nice to meet you, Cartman. Yuh you know, I saw that same jacket you're wearing at Bosco's for $29.95. How much was yours? Um, I juh- I was just wondering if Bosco's is a ripoff?",5,Southpark,181,36,,,,,,,,,
53297,Cartman,11,"...Oh, man.",5,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
53298,Kyle,11,Cartman?!,5,Southpark,9,1,,,,,,,,,
53299,Cartman,11,"Uh, it's nice to meet you, Kyle. I can certainly tell you're a relative of my good friend Kyle here. ",5,Southpark,101,20,,,,,,,,,
53300,Stan,11,What the hell was that?,5,Southpark,23,5,,,,,,,,,
53303,Randy,11,"I dunno, it was going so fast I couldn't see it.  But I want one.",5,Southpark,65,15,,,,,,,,,
53305,Mr. Garrison,11,"We've done it, Mr. Hat. Airline companies be damned. We've invented a whole new mode of transportation! Get some investors on the phone!  Well what are you waiting for?!",5,Southpark,169,29,,,,,,,,,
53307,Kyle,11,"Oh well, I I grew up in the shity, ah ah I really don't care for it. Ah I come from a Jewish family, which of course you already know, because Kyle's from the same family.  I like to read, and I have these polyps on the backs of my hands - I don't know what they are.",5,Southpark,267,58,,,,,,,,,
53308,Cartman,11,"Ohmigod, I'm not gonna make it. I'm not gonna make it.",5,Southpark,54,11,,,,,,,,,
53309,Kyle,11,"...Oh, and I hope one day to be an investment banker.",5,Southpark,53,11,,,,,,,,,
53310,Cartman,11,I... must.. fight it! Need... forty... dollars!,5,Southpark,47,7,,,,,,,,,
53312,Kyle,11,Uh where should I sit? There's no place to sit down here.,5,Southpark,57,12,,,,,,,,,
53315,Kyle,11,"Eh, oh, alright. ",5,Southpark,17,3,,,,,,,,,
53317,Kyle,11,Ah-ah-ah-are wooden desks all that available? I usually prefer the plastic ones because these give me splinters.,5,Southpark,112,17,,,,,,,,,
53318,Cartman,11,"Ugh, ugh!",5,Southpark,9,2,,,,,,,,,
53320,Kyle,11,"Is it cold in here? I realize we're in the mountains, but do we have to freeze to death?",5,Southpark,88,19,,,,,,,,,
53322,Cartman,11,Oh!,5,Southpark,3,1,,,,,,,,,
53324,Cartman,11,"Maybe we'll have to send him to concentration camp. AWGH! Damnit, damnit, damnit!",5,Southpark,81,13,,,,,,,,,
53329,Kyle,11,"Oh, bu- but isn't the cold air making the ball really hard? Ih-it's gonna hurt my hands.",5,Southpark,88,17,,,,,,,,,
53331,Kyle,11,"Alright then, hu-how do I catch it?",5,Southpark,35,7,,,,,,,,,
53333,Kyle,11,Now what?,5,Southpark,9,2,,,,,,,,,
53335,Kyle,11,But it's down in the snow.,5,Southpark,26,6,,,,,,,,,
53337,Kyle,11,But I'll get snow on my gloves and then it will melt and I'll have wet hands.,5,Southpark,77,17,,,,,,,,,
53339,Kyle,11,"Alright, then. ",5,Southpark,15,2,,,,,,,,,
53341,Cartman,11,"Kyle, Kyle!  I just found out that in World War II, some Jewish people were sent to concentration camps.",5,Southpark,104,19,,,,,,,,,
53343,Cartman,11,"Oh, and see, I didn't realize that. But I understand now how you might've felt what I said in the classroom was a racial slut. But see, I had no idea.",5,Southpark,150,31,,,,,,,,,
53345,Cartman,11,"No, I'm seriously! Because, um, I was, I was talkin' to Craig, and Craig was all like, ""Hey, did you know that in World War II they really HAD concentration camps?"" And I was all like, ""No way!"" And this little light went on in my head like, ""Aw man, no wonder Kyle thought what I said in the class, seemed like it was directed at his cousin."" But, but I was literally talkin' about a concentration camp, you know, where you go for a week to learn and focus, you know. Oh, mahan.  What a misunderstanding, huh? ",5,Southpark,511,98,,,,,,,,,
53347,Cartman,11,"Goddamnit, give me another chance!",5,Southpark,34,5,,,,,,,,,
53349,Kyle,11,Uh you did what? ,5,Southpark,17,4,,,,,,,,,
53351,Cartman,11,"Haha,  serves you right, asshole. ",5,Southpark,34,5,,,,,,,,,
53352,Kyle,11,"You, you paid your friends tuh...  not make fun of me?",5,Southpark,54,11,,,,,,,,,
53354,Kyle,11,"Wow uh, you think it takes forty dollars to get people to like me.",5,Southpark,66,14,,,,,,,,,
53356,Kyle,11,Because I m-I mean I really think you could have done it for about $12.50.,5,Southpark,74,15,,,,,,,,,
53358,Kyle,11,"Well, I mean, you didn't just start at 40, didja? You you gotta low-ball these things so you have a place to go.",5,Southpark,112,23,,,,,,,,,
53360,Kyle,11,Boy it sure is dry out here.,5,Southpark,28,7,,,,,,,,,
53361,Mr. Garrison,11,"Gentlemen, imagine being able to travel safely at incredibly fast speeds, and not having to go to the stupid fartface airports!",5,Southpark,127,21,,,,,,,,,
53363,Mr. Garrison,11,"It IS incredible, Mr. Hat. And what makes IT possible  is IT's patented gyroscope design.  Gentlemen, I give you, IT!",5,Southpark,117,20,,,,,,,,,
53367,Mr. Garrison,11,"IT gets over 300 miles to the gallon, and is safely capable of speeds of over 200 miles per hour.",5,Southpark,97,20,,,,,,,,,
53371,Mr. Garrison,11,"Now, IT is easily operated using four flexigrip handles. Two of them are on each side. Left side for throttle, right side for steering.  The third flexigrip is gently inserted into the anus, to keep the driver in place. ",5,Southpark,220,39,,,,,,,,,
53373,Mr. Garrison,11,"...there we go. Now, the final flexigrip is directly in front of the driver so that its small switches can be operated with the mouth, as such.  Put the four together and we're ready to go. ",5,Southpark,190,36,,,,,,,,,
53383,Stan,11,"I know, dude. Every kid in school wants to kick his ass.",5,Southpark,56,12,,,,,,,,,
53385,Stan,11,"Dude, a self-hating Jew? You are becoming a stereotype.",5,Southpark,55,9,,,,,,,,,
53387,Kyle,11,I'm ba-ack!,5,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
53389,Stan,11,"Book. Later, dude. ",5,Southpark,19,3,,,,,,,,,
53391,Mr. Garrison,11,"Okay, good. Just step through here  And then this is your steering and here's your throttle.",5,Southpark,92,16,,,,,,,,,
53393,Mr. Garrison,11,"Okay, now you're just gonna feel a little pinch.",5,Southpark,48,9,,,,,,,,,
53395,Mr. Garrison,11,"It's alright, it's just locking you in.  You can take it.  Doing great, Kathy. How's that ride?  Okay, now use your mouth to operate the turn signals, and you're off.  Great! Who else wants to give it a spin? ",5,Southpark,209,39,,,,,,,,,
53396,Randy,11,"Oh, man, it that the IT?",5,Southpark,24,6,,,,,,,,,
53400,Kyle,11,"I don't know about this, guys. I think sleds are dangerous.",5,Southpark,59,11,,,,,,,,,
53402,Kyle,11,"It seems like I might get splinters, though.",5,Southpark,44,8,,,,,,,,,
53404,Kyle,11,"Hold on. I see.  Oh, Jeezus, this sled is going faaaast.",5,Southpark,56,11,,,,,,,,,
53406,Kyle,11,"I have to watch out for my glasses. Ow! Ow, it's so cold! Oh Jesus! ",5,Southpark,68,15,,,,,,,,,
53408,Kyle,11,It's a least a couple of hours.,5,Southpark,31,7,,,,,,,,,
53410,Cartman,11,He's faaahn.,5,Southpark,12,2,,,,,,,,,
53424,Kyle,11,I'm ba-ack.,5,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
53426,Kyle,11,I'm sorry. You must've been worried sick. I got your sled tangled up with a bus. ,5,Southpark,81,16,,,,,,,,,
53429,Kyle,11,"Ah- I was just sledding, and the next thing I knew my sled rope got tangled with a bus, uh. I gut dragged for over a hundred miles before the bus finally stopped for gas.  I'm sorry about your sled, Kyle.",5,Southpark,204,41,,,,,,,,,
53432,Kyle,11,"Oh, my ears feel like they're frozen off, and I think I have a hemorrhoid from sitting on the sled for so long.",5,Southpark,111,23,,,,,,,,,
53433,Mr. Garrison,11,"We're in the money, Mr. Hat, We're in the money, Mr. Hat...  Oh hi, Jimbo. Can I help you?",5,Southpark,90,19,,,,,,,,,
53435,Mr. Garrison,11,"Oh, right, right. Take a seat.",5,Southpark,30,6,,,,,,,,,
53437,Mr. Garrison,11,"What do you think, Mr. Marsh? All set to put a down payment on that baby?",5,Southpark,73,16,,,,,,,,,
53438,Randy,11,"Well, yeah, but I have one question about the way it works.",5,Southpark,59,12,,,,,,,,,
53439,Mr. Garrison,11,Sure.,5,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
53440,Randy,11,"Well,  it seems all the buttons on these front and rear flexigrips are also found on the side of the vehicle.",5,Southpark,109,21,,,,,,,,,
53441,Mr. Garrison,11,Yeup.,5,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
53442,Randy,11,Well... so... they don't really... do anything.,5,Southpark,47,7,,,,,,,,,
53443,Mr. Garrison,11,Right.,5,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
53444,Randy,11,"So then, couldn't I just order one that works without going in and out of my ass and mouth?",5,Southpark,91,19,,,,,,,,,
53445,Mr. Garrison,11,"Well, I... guess you could. ",5,Southpark,28,5,,,,,,,,,
53450,Kyle,11,I don't know about this guys. I think playing hide and seek in the airport might be dangerous.,5,Southpark,94,18,,,,,,,,,
53452,Stan,11,"Yeah, as soon as we get to the concourse you'll see how fun it is.",5,Southpark,66,15,,,,,,,,,
53457,Kyle,11,Can't we just play hide and seek at home?,5,Southpark,41,9,,,,,,,,,
53460,Kyle,11,"Oh, Jesus!! ",5,Southpark,12,2,,,,,,,,,
53464,Cartman,11,"1, 2, 3, 4...",5,Southpark,13,4,,,,,,,,,
53466,Kyle,11,In there? But it's very confined. I'll get cramps in my legs.,5,Southpark,61,12,,,,,,,,,
53468,Kyle,11,"Uh, alright then.  Oh, would you look at that? I've got a corn on my ankle.  Now where did that one come from? That's the fourth one I've had- ",5,Southpark,143,29,,,,,,,,,
53470,Cartman,11,He's faaahn.,5,Southpark,12,2,,,,,,,,,
53471,Stan,11,Yeah. He'll be waaay better off back at home. ,5,Southpark,46,9,,,,,,,,,
53472,Kyle,11,"Oh, Jesus, this bus is going fast!  Oh, I did it again!!",5,Southpark,56,12,,,,,,,,,
53473,Mr. Garrison,11,"Excuse me, what the hell are you doing?",5,Southpark,39,8,,,,,,,,,

54025,Cartman,13,My God...,5,Southpark,9,2,,,,,,,,,
54027,Cartman,13,"So then, could stem cells be used on someone whose muscle tissue is wasting away? In other words, if a little boy was dying from a muscular disease, the stem cells could become new muscle tissue.",5,Southpark,195,36,,,,,,,,,
54029,Cartman,13,"Well, so then, if the stem cells are placed nest to s Shakey's Pizza, they would become another Shakey's Pizza! And you'd have your own Shakey's Pizza where you didn't have to charge yourself to eat!",5,Southpark,199,36,,,,,,,,,

54072,Chef,13,"Stan, sometimes God takes those closest to us, because it makes him feel better about himself. He is a very vengeful God, Stan. He's all pissed off about something we did thousands of years ago. He just can't get over it, so he doesn't care who he takes. Children, puppies, it don't matter to him, so long as it makes us sad. Do you understand.",5,Southpark,344,65,,,,,,,,,
54073,Stan,13,"But then, why does God give us anything to start with?",5,Southpark,54,11,,,,,,,,,
54074,Chef,13,"Well, look at it this way: if you want to make a baby cry, first you give it a lollipop. Then you take it away. If you never give it a lollipop to begin with, then it would have nothin' to cry about. That's like God, who gives us life and love and help just so that he can tear it all away and make us cry, so he can drink the sweet milk of our tears. You see, it's our tears, Stan, that give God his great power. ",5,Southpark,414,89,,,,,,,,,

All I know is that if there's a chance, a... chance that stem-cell research could save my best friend's life, well... I guess I owe it to him to try and change your minds.  I love Kenny McCormick and...  I want you to love him too.  And I uh, I'm not the best speaker in the world.

You know, you can call a shovel an ice-cream machine, but it's still a shovel, Mom and Dad. Ah, and you can call a lie whatever you want, but it's still a no-good stinkin' lie! And when you start coverin' up one lie with another why, now that's when you get into real trouble!  Boy I've, I've just about had it up to here  with you two! ",5,Southpark,440,87,,,,,,,,,

54391,Cartman,14,We sure are.,5,Southpark,12,3,,,,,,,,,
54392,Butters,14,"I really wish I didn't know that stuff. I guess I learned that sometimes, lying can be for the best. Yup.

54402,Cartman,1,"Hello, is this City Wok?",6,Southpark,24,5,,,,,,,,,
54404,Cartman,1,"Uh, yes, we'd like one order of the City Beef.",6,Southpark,46,10,,,,,,,,,
54406,Kyle,1,"Aha, and I'll have the City Chicken.",6,Southpark,36,7,,,,,,,,,
54408,Stan,1,"Oh, dude, look!  It's that commercial with the guy that lost 400 pounds eating at Subway Sandwiches!",6,Southpark,100,17,,,,,,,,,
54410,Butters,1,"Uh, hey, fellas.",6,Southpark,16,3,,,,,,,,,
54411,Stan,1,Hey Kenny,6,Southpark,9,2,,,,,,,,,
54412,Butters,1,"Now gosh darnit, my name's not Kenny! Kenny's dead, and you're all gonna have to learn to deal with it!",6,Southpark,103,20,,,,,,,,,
54413,Kyle,1,"Okay, Not-Kenny.",6,Southpark,16,2,,,,,,,,,
54415,Butters,1,"Woh, boy! Jared's comin' to town!",6,Southpark,33,6,,,,,,,,,
54416,Kyle,1,Dude! That's today!,6,Southpark,19,3,,,,,,,,,
54417,Stan,1,"We've gotta get down there! Come on, Not-Kenny! ",6,Southpark,48,8,,,,,,,,,
54418,Butters,1,"Now gosh darnit, my name's not Not-Kenny!",6,Southpark,41,7,,,,,,,,,
54419,Cartman,1,"Okay, come on, Not-Not-Kenny.",6,Southpark,29,4,,,,,,,,,
54420,Butters,1,Wo-ah I'm getting steamed now. ,6,Southpark,31,5,,,,,,,,,
54422,Kyle,1,Excuse me? Could we get through here?,6,Southpark,37,7,,,,,,,,,
54424,Randy,1,Here he comes! ,6,Southpark,15,3,,,,,,,,,
54428,Cartman,1,That guy ate all the sandwiches he wanted and lost weight. He is so cool.,6,Southpark,73,15,,,,,,,,,
54431,Butters,1,"Wow, Jared!",6,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
54432,Kyle,1,Dude! Did you really lose all that weight eating nothing but sub sandwiches?,6,Southpark,76,13,,,,,,,,,
54434,Stan,1,What kind of help?,6,Southpark,18,4,,,,,,,,,
54436,Cartman,1,A- AIDS?,6,Southpark,8,2,,,,,,,,,
54438,Stan,1,I'll bet you can.,6,Southpark,17,4,,,,,,,,,
54440,Kyle,1,Them?,6,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
54443,Kyle,1,"Oh, ""A I D E S,"" aides.",6,Southpark,23,7,,,,,,,,,
54445,Kyle,1,"Well, that's not really what you say in the commercial.",6,Southpark,55,10,,,,,,,,,
54447,Kyle,1,"But you're lying to people. If they knew that you didn't eat just all the sandwiches you want, you might not be so popular.",6,Southpark,123,24,,,,,,,,,
54449,Kyle,1,"It matters, dude. ",6,Southpark,18,3,,,,,,,,,
54451,Kyle,1,That penisbutt didn't lose weight eating sub sandwiches. He lost weight because he ate less of them and exercised.,6,Southpark,114,19,,,,,,,,,
54452,Stan,1,"Yeah, it's only in America that somebody can become famous just because they go from being a big fatass to not being a big fatass.",6,Southpark,130,25,,,,,,,,,
54453,Cartman,1,Oh-my-god!  You guys! I think I'm having a genius moment. Yes. Yes! Its coming to me now.,6,Southpark,89,17,,,,,,,,,
54454,Kyle,1,Tha- that's diarrhea.,6,Southpark,21,3,,,,,,,,,
54455,Cartman,1,"Noo. Don't you see what this all means? Anybody could do what he did. What's to stop someone else from going to say, City Wok, and cutting a deal with them? Say they'll eat nothing but their Chinese food, but then eat only a little tiny bit of it and exercise.",6,Southpark,260,51,,,,,,,,,
54456,Stan,1,Then City Wok could say their food makes them lose weight.,6,Southpark,58,11,,,,,,,,,
54457,Cartman,1,"That's right Stan.  It's a cash cow, I tell you.",6,Southpark,48,10,,,,,,,,,
54458,Kyle,1,That's a great idea!,6,Southpark,20,4,,,,,,,,,
54459,Cartman,1,Lose weight and make money... I tell you this is gonna be the greatest thing that Butters has ever done.,6,Southpark,104,20,,,,,,,,,
54460,Butters,1,Me?!,6,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
54461,Cartman,1,"Weh- who do you think I'm talkin' about, Butters? Joyce de Witt?",6,Southpark,64,12,,,,,,,,,
54462,Butters,1,"Oh, no, I thought you meant you. Eh, you're the fat one.",6,Southpark,56,12,,,,,,,,,
54463,Cartman,1,"I can't lose weight, Butters, 'cause I'm not fat. I'm big-boned. You can't slim down bones, stupid!",6,Southpark,99,17,,,,,,,,,
54464,Kyle,1,But Butters isn't fat.,6,Southpark,22,4,,,,,,,,,
54465,Cartman,1,"That's my whole point. First we fatten him up, then we make the deal with City Wok, then take the weight back off.",6,Southpark,114,23,,,,,,,,,
54466,Stan,1,"He's right. If Butters is naturally skinny, he'll be able to take the weight off faster.",6,Southpark,88,16,,,,,,,,,
54467,Butters,1,"But fellas, if I get fat my parents will ground me.",6,Southpark,51,11,,,,,,,,,
54468,Cartman,1,"Oh, come on! Just think about how famous you'll be!",6,Southpark,51,10,,,,,,,,,
54469,Butters,1,You mean like Jared?,6,Southpark,20,4,,,,,,,,,
54470,Kyle,1,Yeah dude! You'll be just like Jared!,6,Southpark,37,7,,,,,,,,,
54471,Butters,1,Well the heck with that! You said Jared was a penis-butt!,6,Southpark,57,11,,,,,,,,,
54472,Stan,1,"You wouldn't be a penis-butt, Butters, you'd be famous. Just think about all those people following you around, singing songs to you just because you lost some weight... His name is Butters, it's Butters. ",6,Southpark,205,34,,,,,,,,,
54473,Cartman,1,He used to be fat but not no more ,6,Southpark,34,9,,,,,,,,,
54474,Kyle,1,City Wok brought him down to a size 4.,6,Southpark,38,9,,,,,,,,,
54475,Stan,1,"Now, he's got lots of moneys and girls",6,Southpark,38,8,,,,,,,,,
54476,Cartman,1,and a lifetime of free food at City Wok.,6,Southpark,40,9,,,,,,,,,
54477,Butters,1,Wow.,6,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
54493,Chef,1,"Hello there, children.",6,Southpark,22,3,,,,,,,,,
54494,Kyle,1,"Chef, we need Butters to gain about fifty pounds fast.",6,Southpark,54,10,,,,,,,,,
54495,Chef,1,Fifty pounds? Why?,6,Southpark,18,3,,,,,,,,,
54496,Cartman,1,"Uuuh, school project.",6,Southpark,21,3,,,,,,,,,
54497,Chef,1,"Well, if you want him to get really fat as fast as possible, one of you will have to marry him.",6,Southpark,95,21,,,,,,,,,
54498,Stan,1,Marry him?,6,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,
54499,Chef,1,It definitely worked for every woman I ever met.,6,Southpark,48,9,,,,,,,,,
54500,Butters,1,"Oh, no, no, no! I ain't gettin' married; my parents will ground me!",6,Southpark,67,13,,,,,,,,,
54501,Kyle,1,"Yeah, none of us wanna marry Butters.",6,Southpark,37,7,,,,,,,,,
54502,Butters,1,"Well, uh, how come? What's wrong with me?",6,Southpark,41,8,,,,,,,,,
54503,Chef,1,"Well, I guess we're gonna have to do this the old-fashioned way. Come on back, children. ",6,Southpark,89,16,,,,,,,,,
54504,Butters,1,"Ugh.  Wuh, wuh, I can't eat no more.",6,Southpark,36,8,,,,,,,,,
54505,Kyle,1,"You have to! Here, have some more mayonnaise. ",6,Southpark,46,8,,,,,,,,,
54506,Stan,1,"Chef, we need more food.",6,Southpark,24,5,,,,,,,,,
54507,Chef,1,"I'm runnin' out, children. ",6,Southpark,27,4,,,,,,,,,
54508,Cartman,1,Damnit Butters! Keep eating or I'll kick you till you're deader than Kenny!,6,Southpark,75,13,,,,,,,,,
54509,Stan,1,"Dude, that isn't cool. You shouldn't joke about Kenny being dead. Enough time hasn't passed.",6,Southpark,92,15,,,,,,,,,
54510,Cartman,1,So how long until we can joke about it?,6,Southpark,39,9,,,,,,,,,
54511,Kyle,1,Twenty-two point three years. That's how long it takes for something tragic to become funny.,6,Southpark,92,15,,,,,,,,,
54512,Cartman,1,"Wugh, that's a long time to wait.",6,Southpark,33,7,,,,,,,,,
54513,Butters,1,Wull I can't eat no more. I-I just keep pukin' it up.,6,Southpark,53,12,,,,,,,,,
54514,Cartman,1,Then eat your puke.,6,Southpark,19,4,,,,,,,,,
54515,Butters,1,No!,6,Southpark,3,1,,,,,,,,,
54516,Cartman,1,"Oh, come on! Japanese girls do it. ",6,Southpark,35,7,,,,,,,,,
54534,Kyle,1,Wow! He looks great!,6,Southpark,20,4,,,,,,,,,
54535,Stan,1,"How do you feel, Butters?",6,Southpark,25,5,,,,,,,,,
54536,Butters,1,"W-well, k-kinda like Cartman.  Aw!",6,Southpark,34,5,,,,,,,,,
54537,Cartman,1,"Get a hold of yourself, man!",6,Southpark,28,6,,,,,,,,,
54538,Stan,1,"Alright, now it's time for phase 2.",6,Southpark,35,7,,,,,,,,,
54540,Cartman,1,"Sir, we have come to offer you the business deal of a lifetime.",6,Southpark,63,13,,,,,,,,,
54542,Kyle,1,Nope. We wanna show the world how healthy your food is. Our fat friend here is going to lose forty pounds eating at Shitty Wok.,6,Southpark,127,25,,,,,,,,,
54544,Cartman,1,The fat one!,6,Southpark,12,3,,,,,,,,,
54545,Stan,1,"We're gonna take before and after photos, and then, when he gets skinny from eating your food, we'll show the world.",6,Southpark,116,21,,,,,,,,,
54547,Kyle,1,Because then you can pay us to use our friend in commercials.,6,Southpark,61,12,,,,,,,,,
54549,Cartman,1,Just like Jared.,6,Southpark,16,3,,,,,,,,,
54552,Cartman,1,"Sir, we are in business!",6,Southpark,24,5,,,,,,,,,
54562,Cartman,1,"Come on, Butters, you gotta get skinny again!  You are such a flabby hunk of crap! Look at those jelly rolls! Jelly rolls I tell ya!! You still got seven chins, boah! You'll never be thin!! Nobody loves you!",6,Southpark,207,39,,,,,,,,,
54563,Butters,1,"Wuh hey now, they do too! Uh, my mom and dad - love me even if I am fat.",6,Southpark,72,19,,,,,,,,,
54564,Cartman,1,"Butters, I'm just trying to offer some motivational help here.",6,Southpark,62,10,,,,,,,,,
54565,Butters,1,Well alright then.,6,Southpark,18,3,,,,,,,,,
54566,Cartman,1,Row you fat bitch! Look at those jelly rolls! Nobody loves you! You're not even a person!,6,Southpark,89,17,,,,,,,,,
54573,Stan,1,Did you bring the camera?,6,Southpark,25,5,,,,,,,,,
54574,Kyle,1,"Yeah, we're all set.",6,Southpark,20,4,,,,,,,,,
54575,Cartman,1,"Guys, I think this might be a good time to discuss some business.",6,Southpark,65,13,,,,,,,,,
54576,Kyle,1,"Well, what do you mean?",6,Southpark,23,5,,,,,,,,,
54577,Cartman,1,"Well, when City Wok sees how skinny Butters is, they're not gonna want him to just make one commercial, they're gonna want several.",6,Southpark,131,23,,,,,,,,,
54578,Stan,1,That's true. Jared did like a hundred for Subway Sandwiches.,6,Southpark,60,10,,,,,,,,,
54579,Cartman,1,I think we're looking at a non-exclusive two-year fifty-picture deal here. My calculations put that at about four million dollars.,6,Southpark,130,20,,,,,,,,,
54580,Kyle,1,Wow! ,6,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
54581,Cartman,1,"Now, I think the four million should be split evenly among the three of us, except that I should get a twenty percent per negation fee off the gross for having come up with the idea.",6,Southpark,182,36,,,,,,,,,
54582,Butters,1,Hey fellas.,6,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
54583,Stan,1,Butters?! What the hell are you doing?!,6,Southpark,39,7,,,,,,,,,
54584,Kyle,1,"Yeah, you're still fat!",6,Southpark,23,4,,,,,,,,,
54585,Butters,1,"Well, I know, ah I can't seem to lose it.",6,Southpark,41,10,,,,,,,,,
54586,Cartman,1,"Well we're supposed to shoot your commercial today, you fat piece of crap!",6,Southpark,74,13,,,,,,,,,
54587,Butters,1,Well ah I don't know what to tell ya. Losin' weight is harder than puttin' it on.,6,Southpark,81,17,,,,,,,,,
54588,Cartman,1,"No it isn't, stupid blubberbutt!",6,Southpark,32,5,,,,,,,,,
54589,Stan,1,Did you eat only once ounce of City Wok like we told you?!,6,Southpark,58,13,,,,,,,,,
54590,Butters,1,"Well uh yeah, but ah, I don't know...",6,Southpark,37,8,,,,,,,,,
54591,Kyle,1,Why are you doing this to us?!,6,Southpark,30,7,,,,,,,,,
54592,Stan,1,All prepared for liposuction surgery?,6,Southpark,37,5,,,,,,,,,
54593,Cartman,1,Check.,6,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
54594,Butters,1,"Uh, I don't know about this, fellas.",6,Southpark,36,7,,,,,,,,,
54595,Stan,1,"Hey, you're the one who screwed us by not losing weight, Butters. ",6,Southpark,66,12,,,,,,,,,
54596,Kyle,1,"Okay, it says here the operation begins with a one-inch incision in the ab-do-men on the left side just above the hip.",6,Southpark,118,22,,,,,,,,,
54597,Cartman,1,That should blah  ah- here. ,6,Southpark,28,5,,,,,,,,,
54598,Butters,1,Woahhh!,6,Southpark,7,1,,,,,,,,,
54599,Cartman,1,Oh stop your bitchin' Butters! Kenny woulda took it like a man!,6,Southpark,63,12,,,,,,,,,
54600,Kyle,1,"Okay, now put one end of the tube a half an inch into the incision. ",6,Southpark,68,15,,,,,,,,,
54601,Cartman,1,Alrighty.,6,Southpark,9,1,,,,,,,,,
54602,Butters,1,"Whoa. I think this is a bad idea, fellas. I feel woozy.",6,Southpark,55,12,,,,,,,,,
54603,Cartman,1,"Alright, I think it's in. ",6,Southpark,26,5,,,,,,,,,
54604,Kyle,1,The liposuction is a process of siphoning out the excess fat. ,6,Southpark,62,11,,,,,,,,,
54605,Cartman,1,"Bohogh, egh. ",6,Southpark,13,2,,,,,,,,,
54606,Butters,1,Waaaahh!,6,Southpark,8,1,,,,,,,,,
54607,Cartman,1,There it goes.,6,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,
54608,Kyle,1,"Alright, it's working!",6,Southpark,22,3,,,,,,,,,
54609,Cartman,1,"Aw man, it tastes like that, um, you know that cream-chipped-beef stuff that Chef makes sometimes.",6,Southpark,98,16,,,,,,,,,
54610,Butters,1,"Aahh heh ahh, I don't feel very good.",6,Southpark,37,8,,,,,,,,,
54611,Stan,1,"Shut up, Butters, it's your own damned fault.",6,Southpark,45,8,,,,,,,,,
54612,Butters,1,Everything's getting dark...,6,Southpark,28,3,,,,,,,,,
54613,Stan,1,We've gotta hurry this up. ,6,Southpark,27,5,,,,,,,,,
54614,Cartman,1,"Oh yeah, keep doing that. That's working good.",6,Southpark,46,8,,,,,,,,,
54615,Stan,1,He's losing weight. ,6,Southpark,20,3,,,,,,,,,
54616,Cartman,1,"Oh, whoa. Whoa! ",6,Southpark,16,3,,,,,,,,,
54617,Kyle,1,It's out of control! ,6,Southpark,21,4,,,,,,,,,
54618,Butters,1,"Whoa, everything's getting sparkly. ",6,Southpark,36,4,,,,,,,,,
54619,Stan,1,"Oh no, dude, Butters' parents are home.",6,Southpark,39,7,,,,,,,,,
54620,Cartman,1,"Oh, crap!",6,Southpark,9,2,,,,,,,,,
54621,Stan,1,"Dude, bail! ",6,Southpark,12,2,,,,,,,,,
54623,Butters,1,Mom. Dad.,6,Southpark,9,2,,,,,,,,,
54625,Butters,1,Yes sir.,6,Southpark,8,2,,,,,,,,,
54627,Butters,1,"Four times, mom.",6,Southpark,16,3,,,,,,,,,
54629,Butters,1,"Yes, sir. ",6,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,
54637,Chef,1,You're gonna give children AIDS?!,6,Southpark,33,5,,,,,,,,,
54640,Stan,1,"Come on, Butters. Time to go.",6,Southpark,29,6,,,,,,,,,
54641,Butters,1,Uh- go where?,6,Southpark,13,3,,,,,,,,,
54642,Kyle,1,To City Wok so we can make our money. God!,6,Southpark,42,10,,,,,,,,,
54643,Butters,1,"I can't go anywhere, fellas. I've been grounded for havin' liposuction... surgery. ",6,Southpark,83,12,,,,,,,,,
54644,Stan,1,What?,6,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
54645,Butters,1,"Wuh well I told you my parents would be sore, and they said for... havin' liposuction surgery, I can't play outside for five days.",6,Southpark,130,24,,,,,,,,,
54646,Cartman,1,"Dude, we just need you to come down to City Wok real quick so they can see how skinny you are!",6,Southpark,94,21,,,,,,,,,
54647,Butters,1,"Well you guys have already got me in Dutch for gettin' fat, and then I got in double-Dutch for... havin' liposuction, and now you're askin' me to be in triple Dutch?!  Huh-uh! I'll never be that Dutch!",6,Southpark,201,37,,,,,,,,,
54648,Stan,1,...Kenny would have done it.,6,Southpark,28,5,,,,,,,,,
54649,Kyle,1,Yep.,6,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,

54732,Stan,1,"Well, so much for our money.",6,Southpark,28,6,,,,,,,,,
54733,Kyle,1,"Yeah, but you know, I've learned something today. It would have been wrong to exploit Butters' weight loss. Because then lots of fat people would have believed it. And then gone and eaten a ton of Chinese food instead of dieting properly. They'd still be fat and, we'd be responsible for their shattered dreams.",6,Southpark,311,54,,,,,,,,,
54734,Butters,1,"Yeah, I don't like shattering fat peoples' dreams. Besides, I'd get grounded.  Oh, Jesus! I'm supposed to be grounded! ",6,Southpark,119,19,,,,,,,,,

54762,Cartman,2,"Look you guys, Butters is asleep.",6,Southpark,33,6,,,,,,,,,
54763,Stan,2,He's such a douchebag,6,Southpark,21,4,,,,,,,,,
54764,Cartman,2,"Hey! Have you guys ever seen this trick?  When someone's sleeping, you can take a glass of warm water,  and you put their hand in it... ",6,Southpark,136,26,,,,,,,,,

54792,Stan,2,What's a Hitler?,6,Southpark,16,3,,,,,,,,,
54793,Cartman,2,"You know, when somebody is sleeping and you put your finger up your butt and then, wipe it on their upper lip to give them a little Hitler mustache? You've never Hitlered anyone?",6,Southpark,178,33,,,,,,,,,

55993,Butters,5,"I told you, we can't go to my house!",6,Southpark,36,9,,,,,,,,,
55994,Cartman,5,And my house is being fumigated!,6,Southpark,32,6,,,,,,,,,
55995,Stan,5,"Well, screw it! We'll watch it in your house even if it is being fumigated!",6,Southpark,75,15,,,,,,,,,

56017,Chef,5,"...Yes, I pressed ""menu"" three times!  No! It's givin' me the same error message!  Yes I read the instruction manual!",6,Southpark,117,20,,,,,,,,,
56019,Kyle,5,Oh Jesus! Now where do we go??,6,Southpark,30,7,,,,,,,,,
56020,Stan,5,"We've tried everywhere! Butters, are you absolutely sure we can't go to your house??",6,Southpark,84,14,,,,,,,,,
56021,Butters,5,I'm sure! There's no way!,6,Southpark,25,5,,,,,,,,,
56022,Kyle,5,Well why not?!,6,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,
56023,Butters,5,"Uh because! Uh my parents are out of town, and I don't have a babysitter.",6,Southpark,73,15,,,,,,,,,
56024,Cartman,5,"Oh, God-dammit you better be kidding!",6,Southpark,37,6,,,,,,,,,
56025,Butters,5,No! I really don't have a babysitter. That's why I'm stayin' at Stan's.,6,Southpark,71,13,,,,,,,,,
56026,Kyle,5,This whole time your TV is in a house with nobody in it?!,6,Southpark,57,13,,,,,,,,,
56027,Stan,5,"Come on, let's just go! We'll kill Butters later! ",6,Southpark,50,9,,,,,,,,,
56029,Cartman,5,"The time has come! Turn it on, turn it on! ",6,Southpark,43,10,,,,,,,,,
56031,Stan,5,We made it! ,6,Southpark,12,3,,,,,,,,,

56034,Cartman,5,These commercials are all so God-damn stupid!,6,Southpark,45,7,,,,,,,,,
56035,Stan,5,"Jesus Christ, how long is this commercial break gonna be??",6,Southpark,58,10,,,,,,,,,
56036,Kyle,5,What if they don't show the Terrance & Phillip trailer at all? What if we went through all of this for nothing?,6,Southpark,111,22,,,,,,,,,
56037,Butters,5,They have to show it! They promised they would!,6,Southpark,47,9,,,,,,,,,
56038,Cartman,5,"You guys, calm down. This is what TV shows always do. They make the last commercial break the longest.",6,Southpark,102,19,,,,,,,,,
56039,Kyle,5,That's bull-crap! TV shows are gay!,6,Southpark,35,6,,,,,,,,,

56047,Butters,5,"Oh, I'm so glad we didn't miss it! ",6,Southpark,35,8,,,,,,,,,
56048,Cartman,5,"You guys, Clyde said he taped it and kids can come over now to have a see.",6,Southpark,74,17,,,,,,,,,
56049,Stan,5,"Oh, dude, let's go!",6,Southpark,19,4,,,,,,,,,
56050,Butters,5,Yeah. ,6,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
56051,Kyle,5,"It looks even better than their first movie, huh?",6,Southpark,49,9,,,,,,,,,
56052,Cartman,5,"Yeah, it sure does!",6,Southpark,19,4,,,,,,,,,
56053,Stan,5,I wonder if it's all a western?,6,Southpark,31,7,,,,,,,,,
56054,Butters,5,How far away is June?,6,Southpark,21,5,,,,,,,,,
56061,Chef,5,"So I'm supposed to press ""menu,"" then ""function,"" then ""enter.""",6,Southpark,63,10,,,,,,,,,
56062,Stan,6,"Okay, here he comes. ",6,Southpark,21,4,,,,,,,,,
56063,Kyle,6,Who wants to tell him?,6,Southpark,22,5,,,,,,,,,
56064,Cartman,6,I'll do it.,6,Southpark,11,3,,,,,,,,,
56065,Butters,6,"Hehey, fellas. I'm glad you called me. There was a pie-eating contest down at the firehouse, and I thought we should all go.",6,Southpark,124,23,,,,,,,,,
56066,Cartman,6,"Butters, could you take a seat, please?",6,Southpark,39,7,,,,,,,,,
56067,Butters,6,"Wuh well, sure. ",6,Southpark,16,3,,,,,,,,,
56068,Cartman,6,"Butters, we have to have a very difficult conversation.",6,Southpark,55,9,,,,,,,,,
56069,Butters,6,Wull what is it?,6,Southpark,16,4,,,,,,,,,
56070,Cartman,6,"Well, in the, in the months since our friend Kenny died, you've really stepped up as a friend and ""filled the gap."" ",6,Southpark,116,22,,,,,,,,,
56071,Butters,6,"Well uh, it's my pleasure! I love bein' you guys' new friend.",6,Southpark,61,12,,,,,,,,,
56072,Cartman,6,"Yes. Well, Butters, it's just not working out.",6,Southpark,46,8,,,,,,,,,
56073,Butters,6,Not working out?,6,Southpark,16,3,,,,,,,,,
56074,Cartman,6,"I'm afraid we're gonna have to let you go, as our friend. You're just tooo...",6,Southpark,77,15,,,,,,,,,
56075,Kyle,6,Lame,6,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
56076,Cartman,6,"Lame, yes.",6,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,
56077,Butters,6,"Well, but ah I can get better.",6,Southpark,30,7,,,,,,,,,
56078,Stan,6,"Butters, you just don't really fit in with us here. We think it's best for all of us if you for friendship opportunities elsewhere.",6,Southpark,131,24,,,,,,,,,
56079,Kyle,6,"But we certainly want to thank you for all your hard work and attempts at being our friend, lame as they were.",6,Southpark,110,22,,,,,,,,,
56080,Butters,6,Huh but ah I thought we were gettin' along... great. Heh ah I thought we were really havin' fun together.,6,Southpark,105,20,,,,,,,,,
56081,Cartman,6,"Yes, well, we weren't.",6,Southpark,22,4,,,,,,,,,
56082,Butters,6,"Please, fellas, uh don't fire me.",6,Southpark,33,6,,,,,,,,,
56083,Kyle,6,"We're sorry, Butters.  Our mind is made up.",6,Southpark,43,8,,,,,,,,,
56084,Cartman,6,"But we certainly wanna thank you for coming by.  You know the way out, right? ",6,Southpark,78,15,,,,,,,,,
56085,Kyle,6,Phew.,6,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
56087,Kyle,6,"Hm, I think he took that pretty well, I think.",6,Southpark,46,10,,,,,,,,,
56088,Cartman,6,Who cares?,6,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,
56089,Stan,6,"All right, so let's get started on who's gonna be the new person to take Kenny's place.",6,Southpark,87,17,,,,,,,,,
56090,Butters,6,"The world isn't fair. I do everything people ask me to. I stand in the lunch line for them, I buy tampons at the store for them, I go on Maury Povich with balls on my chin for them.  And yet, nobody accepts me. I am an outcast. A shadow of a man who can find no companion... ship. No love from others.  Fine!  If I am to be an outcast, so be it!  I'm through doin' what others tell me to do, and I am sick of this world and the stin-, and the stinky people in it!  From now on I will dedicate my life to bringing chaos to the world that has rejected me!  I will become the greatest supervillain  the world has ever seen!  Where I go, destruction will follow! ",6,Southpark,659,134,,,,,,,,,
56091,Butters,6,"Prepare, O little town! Uh prepare for the greatest supervillain you've ever seen! Professor Chaos! ",6,Southpark,100,15,,,,,,,,,
56093,Butters,6,"Hu-uh, okay Mom.  Yes. Uh sleet sleep for now.  Tomorrow, the chaos begins. ",6,Southpark,76,13,,,,,,,,,
56094,Cartman,6,"All right, we wanna thank everybody for coming. This is a great turnout.  Uh, as you know, our friend Kenny died a few months ago and we are still looking to fill the void with a new friend. Now, you've all been selected as possible candidates, but unfortunately, there is only room for one of you. So Stan and Kyle and I will be spending the next few days going out with each one of you and narrowing our choices down. Until we think we've found the perfect friend. Are there any questions?",6,Southpark,491,93,,,,,,,,,
56096,Cartman,6,"Clyde... ... okay. Now, the first thing we have to do is cut the list down from twenty choices to ten. And so today we will all be going to the amusement park together to see who we want to cut. Please keep in mind that this will all be videotaped, so put on your best friend faces, and may the best friend win. Oh, and we will be needing a ten dollar per person entrance fee.",6,Southpark,376,77,,,,,,,,,
56100,Butters,6,"I am Professor Chaos, and now, this puny world uh will bow down to me! ",6,Southpark,71,15,,,,,,,,,
56101,Stan,6,So today we went to the amusement park with all our possible friends.  It was a really fun time. We rode all the rides and everyone got along great.,6,Southpark,148,29,,,,,,,,,
56102,Cartman,6,I think the person that stood out most at the amusement park was Jimmy. ,6,Southpark,72,14,,,,,,,,,
56104,Kyle,6,Tweek. Now there's an interesting choice. Tweek has a lot of qualities that I look for in a friend.,6,Southpark,99,19,,,,,,,,,
56107,Cartman,6,"...Yeah, I've only seen that kid in class, but he never does anything. He's more like a prop. ",6,Southpark,94,18,,,,,,,,,
56108,Kyle,6,"Towelie is a tough choice because,  even though I can see how always having a towel around can come in handy, he's just always so high.",6,Southpark,135,26,,,,,,,,,
56110,Cartman,6,"We decided to get some one-on-one time with Jimmy and ride the log ride.  The great thing was that, because Jimmy's crippled, we got to go to the front of the line.  That was definitely big points for Jimmy, you know, but, but then we got to the ride itself, and...",6,Southpark,265,51,,,,,,,,,
56113,Cartman,6,"Oh, really?  That's gonna cost some points. ",6,Southpark,44,7,,,,,,,,,
56114,Kyle,6,"But right now I'd say if we're gonna have a retard for a friend, I, I have to pick Timmy. Because Timmy doesn't tell any jokes.",6,Southpark,127,26,,,,,,,,,
56116,Stan,6,One thing for sure: picking our new friend isn't gonna be easy.,6,Southpark,63,12,,,,,,,,,
56117,Butters,6,Kneel. Kneel before Professor Chaos! ,6,Southpark,37,5,,,,,,,,,
56118,Butters,6,"Ah, the look on their faces when they got the wrong soup. I love bringing chaos!  And that's only the beginning! ",6,Southpark,113,21,,,,,,,,,
56119,Cartman,6,"All right, everyone. It was a tough decision, but based on our time with you all at the amusement park, we have whittled our choices down to ten.  If you receive a rose, please stay. If you don't, get the fudge out.  Kyle, will you announce the people we want to stay?",6,Southpark,268,52,,,,,,,,,
56120,Kyle,6,Token.  Clyde.  Craig  Timmy,6,Southpark,28,4,,,,,,,,,
56123,Kyle,6,Pip  Jimmy  Jason  Towelie  Luigi .,6,Southpark,35,6,,,,,,,,,
56124,Cartman,6,"Just one more rose left, Kyle. Who does it go to?",6,Southpark,49,11,,,,,,,,,
56125,Kyle,6,Tweek.,6,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
56127,Cartman,6,"All right, the rest of you, thanks for coming. Get the fudge out! ",6,Southpark,66,13,,,,,,,,,
56130,Stan,6,"All right, congratulations to those of you selected to stay. In the end, one of you will be the new Kenny.  Good luck.",6,Southpark,118,23,,,,,,,,,
56132,Butters,6,"It certainly is, Mother. Did ya hear about what's been goin' on? Some horrible new supervillain made somebody get the wrong soup order ot Bennigan's.",6,Southpark,149,25,,,,,,,,,
56134,Butters,6,"Yeh, you didn't? ",6,Southpark,17,3,,,,,,,,,
56135,Butters,6,"Uh Dad, can I uh can I see the newspaper real quick?",6,Southpark,52,12,,,,,,,,,
56137,Butters,6,"Nothing.  Nothing!  It's the liberal media! They're keeping the stories of my deeds covered up, so as not to cause a panic. Well, I guess it's time to take it up a notch! ",6,Southpark,171,33,,,,,,,,,
56138,Stan,6,"Okay, next? ",6,Southpark,12,2,,,,,,,,,
56139,Kyle,6,This looks pretty good.,6,Southpark,23,4,,,,,,,,,
56140,Stan,6,"Yeah, it's not bad. Next? ",6,Southpark,26,5,,,,,,,,,
56142,Cartman,6,Next?,6,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
56143,Cartman,6,"Okay, so now we're gonna see how you all work as a friend during classtime. Your performances will be judged primarily on how you help us cheat and give us answers. So good luck, everybody.",6,Southpark,189,35,,,,,,,,,
56145,Cartman,6,Alrighty then. ,6,Southpark,15,2,,,,,,,,,
56147,Butters,6,"Yes. Look around for your precious eraser. You won't find it. That eraser's in my back yard, buried three feet below the surface of the earth.  And do you even suspect me?? No! Now we shall all see how you all like your dear chalkboard without an eraser.  And information, it just keeps pilin' up and pilin' up, until your minuscule brains can take it no longer! ",6,Southpark,363,67,,,,,,,,,
56149,Butters,6,"So! You all think that you can outsmart Professor Chaos, do you?!",6,Southpark,65,12,,,,,,,,,
56151,Butters,6,"Ms. Choksondik,",6,Southpark,15,2,,,,,,,,,
56153,Butters,6,"Ah, I need to go to the bathroom. R-really bad.",6,Southpark,47,10,,,,,,,,,
56155,Butters,6,"Alright. I'm goin' to the bathroom now. If anybody needs me, ah that's where I'll be.",6,Southpark,85,16,,,,,,,,,
56157,Cartman,6,"Uh, what's the question again?",6,Southpark,30,5,,,,,,,,,
56159,Cartman,6,Five times one is of course...,6,Southpark,30,6,,,,,,,,,

56451,Kyle,7,It is?,6,Southpark,6,2,,,,,,,,,
56452,Chef,7,"Yes! That stuff that was in that vial didn't come from you, it came from someone else.  I thought you children took turns rapin' and then murdered the teacher. ",6,Southpark,160,29,,,,,,,,,

Uh, behold!  This device that I have made will take the cherries out of chocolate-covered cherries and replace the inside instead, with two-month-old mayonnaise.  People will think that they are gonna get a bite of a sweet, delicious cherry, but, instead, they'll get a mouth full of yuckies, and sticky mayonnaise. Hey!  You've never ...seen this on the Simpsons, right?",6,Southpark,549,89,,,,,,,,,

56494,Cartman,7,"Frances, let's talk. I don't want a bunch of bullcrap from you and you don't a bunch of bullcrap from me, right? Where does that get us? Nowhere. The truth is, I'm completely certified to handle sea men, and though I may appear young, I'm one of the leading sea men authorities of the Midwest. Up and comer, you know what I'm saying? I'll have my own business soon and I'll need people to run it. I'm talkin' about you, Frances. And I'm talkin' about a six-figure income. How does that sound? ",6,Southpark,493,92,,,,,,,,,

56550,Butters,7,"Really? So I shouldn't care if I come up with an idea, and the Simpsons already did it. It... uh...doesn't... matter.  Everything is back to normal, a, I think... I think I can go back to tryin' to destroy the world again.",6,Southpark,222,42,,,,,,,,,

56798,Cartman,8,Heh...  what?,6,Southpark,13,2,,,,,,,,,
56799,Kyle,8,"You won the bet. You were totally accurate about being able to crap out your mouth, and I've just been frustrated because I didn't think of it first. I want you to enjoy that money because... you really impressed me with your insight and... I'm... proud to have you as a friend.",6,Southpark,278,52,,,,,,,,,
56800,Cartman,8,"You sonofabitch, Kyle!! I hate you!! ",6,Southpark,37,6,,,,,,,,,
56802,Randy,8,"Great news, Stan! The Vatican is burning down!",6,Southpark,46,8,,,,,,,,,
56810,Randy,8,"He's right, Sharon. We don't have to believe every word of the Bible. They're just stories to help us to live by. We shouldn't toss away the lessons of the Bible just because some assholes in Italy screwed it up.",6,Southpark,212,40,,,,,,,,,
56812,Randy,8,"Gang, I think maybe we, owe God an apology.",6,Southpark,43,9,,,,,,,,,
56813,Stan,8,Does this mean we have to go to church on Sundays again?,6,Southpark,56,12,,,,,,,,,
56814,Randy,8,"No. It means we get to, son. It means... we get to. ",6,Southpark,52,12,,,,,,,,,
56815,Stan,9,"Oh, cool. A preview. ",6,Southpark,21,4,,,,,,,,,
56817,Stan,9,"Aw, dude, why would they do that?",6,Southpark,33,7,,,,,,,,,
56818,Cartman,9,"Yeah, hippies and terrorists are the same thing.",6,Southpark,48,8,,,,,,,,,
56819,Kyle,9,"No, dude. They only changed ""terrorist"" to ""hippie"" to make E.T. more P.C.",6,Southpark,74,13,,,,,,,,,
56820,Stan,9,That's gay. ,6,Southpark,12,2,,,,,,,,,
56822,Stan,9,Why the hell do these directors keep updating their movies?,6,Southpark,59,10,,,,,,,,,
56827,Stan,9,"Goddamnit, that pissed me off!",6,Southpark,30,5,,,,,,,,,
56828,Cartman,9,"Yeah, we want our money back!",6,Southpark,29,6,,,,,,,,,
56830,Cartman,9,You asshole! ,6,Southpark,13,2,,,,,,,,,
56831,Kyle,9,Why don't they leave those movies alone? We liked them the way they were!,6,Southpark,73,14,,,,,,,,,
56833,Stan,9,"Tweek is right. It isn't fair for those asshole directors to keep changing their movies and making them different! Movies are art, and art shouldn't be modified!",6,Southpark,161,27,,,,,,,,,
56834,Kyle,9,"Yeah, what if they had modified the Roman Coliseum every year? It would just be another big douchey stadium now.",6,Southpark,112,20,,,,,,,,,
56835,Stan,9,We have to do something. Let's form a club.,6,Southpark,43,9,,,,,,,,,
56836,Cartman,9,Yeah! We can form a club that takes food stamps from poor people and then sells them back to the government for a profit.,6,Southpark,121,24,,,,,,,,,
56837,Stan,9,"No, fatass! I mean a club to protect films from their directors, so they can't be messed with!",6,Southpark,94,18,,,,,,,,,
56838,Kyle,9,"Yeah. We'll be the ""Save Films From Their Own Directors"" club",6,Southpark,61,11,,,,,,,,,
56841,Cartman,9,"Tweek, now Goddamnit, we picked you to be our new friend to replace Kenny because we thought you were a team player!",6,Southpark,116,22,,,,,,,,,
56843,Cartman,9,"Now, either you stop with these faggotronics or we'll find someone to replace YOU!",6,Southpark,82,14,,,,,,,,,
56845,Cartman,9,"Dude, that sign sucks! Nobody's gonna show up!",6,Southpark,46,8,,,,,,,,,
56846,Stan,9,Well what's wrong with it?,6,Southpark,26,5,,,,,,,,,
56847,Cartman,9,"Look at it, dude. You're not offering any fabulous prizes. You have to offer fabulous prizes if you want people to show up for your stupid crap. Here. ",6,Southpark,151,28,,,,,,,,,
56848,Kyle,9,"""Free hat?""",6,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
56849,Cartman,9,"Yeah, if you offer free hats, m-maybe people will show up.",6,Southpark,58,11,,,,,,,,,
56851,Cartman,9,Well we can just make them out of paper.,6,Southpark,40,9,,,,,,,,,
56853,Cartman,9,"It's not hard, it's just a stupid little paper hat. People just need free stuff - don't you guys know anything?!",6,Southpark,112,21,,,,,,,,,
56855,Stan,9,"Alright, let's go get the gymnasium ready. Tweek, you go make fifty hats. ",6,Southpark,74,13,,,,,,,,,
56862,Cartman,9,Tweek!  TWEEK!!  TWEEK!!,6,Southpark,24,3,,,,,,,,,
56864,Cartman,9,How many hats have you made?,6,Southpark,28,6,,,,,,,,,
56866,Cartman,9,We only have until 10 a.m. tomorrow!  Get the lead out!,6,Southpark,55,11,,,,,,,,,
56869,Stan,9,What?,6,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
56871,Kyle,9,"Calm down, Tweek. Fifteen might be enough.",6,Southpark,42,7,,,,,,,,,
56872,Stan,9,"Yeah, let's see if anyone has even shown up yet.  Dude, there's like a thousand people in there!",6,Southpark,96,18,,,,,,,,,
56874,Cartman,9,"Then I'mo kick your ass, Tweek!",6,Southpark,31,6,,,,,,,,,
56876,Kyle,9,"Wait. It's okay. Look, maybe these people all turned out because they believe in saving films. Maybe they don't even care about the free hats.",6,Southpark,142,25,,,,,,,,,
56879,Cartman,9,I told you guys: never underestimate the power of a free hat.,6,Southpark,61,12,,,,,,,,,
56882,Stan,9,"Relax, Tweek, we're just gonna have to go in there and explain what happened. There are more important things right now than free hats.",6,Southpark,135,24,,,,,,,,,
56883,Stan,9,"Okay, uh, we wanna thank you all for coming. We're really happy to see such enthusiasm for our cause.",6,Southpark,101,19,,,,,,,,,
56885,Stan,9,"Uh, one thing before I continue. Unfortunately we don't have enough of the... free hats for everyone. ",6,Southpark,102,17,,,,,,,,,
56887,Cartman,9,"Yes, we apologize, but our friend Tweek here didn't make enough of them.",6,Southpark,72,13,,,,,,,,,
56891,Stan,9,"You mean, you just came because you believe in our cause?",6,Southpark,57,11,,,,,,,,,
56897,Stan,9,"Aaaah, , okay apparently there's been a bit of a misunderstanding. This is a rally to save films from their directors? ",6,Southpark,119,21,,,,,,,,,
56899,Kyle,9,We believe that films are pieces of art that must be preserved from the perverse hands of their agent filmmakers..,6,Southpark,114,20,,,,,,,,,
56902,Stan,9,"Waitwaitwaitwait!  Don't you see what's happening out there? The films you all grew up with, that touched YOUR lives and are part of YOUR soul are now being updated and changed. Join us and we CAN be a group that makes a difference!",6,Southpark,232,43,,,,,,,,,
56904,Stan,9,"Uh, sure, and we'll also try to free Hat.",6,Southpark,41,9,,,,,,,,,
56907,Stan,9,"...212, 213, 214 members!",6,Southpark,25,4,,,,,,,,,
56909,Kyle,9,What?,6,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
56911,Stan,9,Really? That's great.,6,Southpark,21,3,,,,,,,,,
56912,Kyle,9,Yah.,6,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
56914,Stan,9,"If we go on Nightline, the whole country can hear about what's happening to our classic films.",6,Southpark,94,17,,,,,,,,,
56915,Cartman,9,But just remember that I do all the talking.,6,Southpark,44,9,,,,,,,,,
56916,Kyle,9,You?? Why?,6,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,
56917,Cartman,9,Because I'm the official spokesman. I got dibs on it.,6,Southpark,53,10,,,,,,,,,
56918,Stan,9,When did we do dibs for it?,6,Southpark,27,7,,,,,,,,,
56919,Cartman,9,Just now -  1 2 3 dibs! ,6,Southpark,24,7,,,,,,,,,
56920,Kyle,9,Me.,6,Southpark,3,1,,,,,,,,,
56922,Kyle,9,"Alright, fine!  You're the spokesman, Cartman! But you'd better not screw it up!",6,Southpark,80,13,,,,,,,,,
56923,Cartman,9,What could possibly go wrong?,6,Southpark,29,5,,,,,,,,,
56925,Cartman,9,"...I believe that can best be answered by our official spokesman, Tweek. ",6,Southpark,73,12,,,,,,,,,
56932,Kyle,9,We believe that films have to be taken away from people like Steven Spielberg and George Lucas because they're insane.,6,Southpark,118,20,,,,,,,,,
56940,Cartman,9,"Dude, that's Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. ",6,Southpark,48,7,,,,,,,,,
56943,Kyle,9,"Ah, I thought we were speaking for the children.",6,Southpark,48,9,,,,,,,,,
56944,Cartman,9,"Yeah, we're children.",6,Southpark,21,3,,,,,,,,,
56945,Stan,9,"Uh-look, if the Beatles went back and updated their White Album every few years, what would we have now?",6,Southpark,104,19,,,,,,,,,
56946,Cartman,9,"Yeah, these guys are only motivated by money, Ted.",6,Southpark,50,9,,,,,,,,,
56948,Cartman,9,Think about it. Spielberg? Jew. Lucas? Jew. Kyle? Jew. Coincidence?,6,Southpark,67,10,,,,,,,,,
56951,Kyle,9,"Dude, don't you see that it's not? It'd be like, changing Raiders of the Lost Ark!",6,Southpark,82,16,,,,,,,,,
56955,Kyle,9,No. NOO!!,6,Southpark,9,2,,,,,,,,,
56956,Stan,9,"Members, this is our darkest hour. We've just learned that George Lucas and Steven Spielberg now intend to update and change Raiders of the Lost Ark.  There's only one way we can stop this important and historical piece of art from being harmed. Mr. Secretary? ",6,Southpark,261,45,,,,,,,,,
56957,Cartman,9,Thank you.  Our intelligence tells us that the original negative to Raiders of the Lost Ark is currently somewhere in George Lucas's house. We need to find and usurp that negative.,6,Southpark,180,31,,,,,,,,,
56959,Stan,9,That is our understanding.,6,Southpark,26,4,,,,,,,,,
56964,Kyle,9,Nonono! We need to do this first.,6,Southpark,33,7,,,,,,,,,
56966,Stan,9,"It's just that, you know, he killed twenty-three babies.",6,Southpark,56,9,,,,,,,,,
56969,Cartman,9,He... killed... twenty-three babies in self-defense?,6,Southpark,52,6,,,,,,,,,
56973,Stan,9,Alright alright. But right now we've gotta focus on getting those original prints of Raider,6,Southpark,91,15,,,,,,,,,
56976,Stan,9,"Well, it looks like we're gonna have to do this ourselves.",6,Southpark,58,11,,,,,,,,,
56978,Kyle,9,We're just gonna fly to California and break into George Lucas's house. What's stressful about that?,6,Southpark,100,16,,,,,,,,,
56980,Cartman,9,"Okay, Tweek, let me tell you something: You've been our new friend now for two weeks, okay? And I've gotta be honest with you, it isn't going well.",6,Southpark,147,28,,,,,,,,,
56982,Cartman,9,"People aren't that into you, Tweek. They find you kind of annoying. Now, I say you've got one last shot here, and I don't want you to blow it, okay? Does that help take the stress off?",6,Southpark,184,37,,,,,,,,,
56983,Stan,9,"Okay, go. ",6,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,
56985,Cartman,9,"Stop, Tweek! This is not the time for faggocity! ",6,Southpark,49,9,,,,,,,,,
56986,Kyle,9,This looks like the right room.,6,Southpark,31,6,,,,,,,,,
56988,Stan,9,Over here! ,6,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
56989,Kyle,9,That's it!,6,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,
56990,Cartman,9,"Alriiight! Get it, Tweek!",6,Southpark,25,4,,,,,,,,,
56992,Cartman,9,"Get it, you piece of crap, before I grab your nutsack and twist it!",6,Southpark,67,14,,,,,,,,,
56998,Kyle,9,"Do with us what you will, Mr. Lucas!  But please, don't change Raiders of the Lost Ark.",6,Southpark,87,17,,,,,,,,,
57000,Cartman,9,"Alright, you asked for it. I'm afraid you leave us no choice. It's time for Plan B.",6,Southpark,83,17,,,,,,,,,
57001,Stan,9,"Aw, really?",6,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
57003,Cartman,9,"You have a heart made of ice, Mr. Lucas, and so we're goin' tuh melt your icy heart... with a cool island song. Gentlemen? ",6,Southpark,123,24,,,,,,,,,
57005,Cartman,9,"Hit it, Tweek!  In the tropical isle with the coconut tree, there's a lots of-",6,Southpark,78,15,,,,,,,,,
57006,Stan,9,Waitwaitwaitwaitwait. I thought we were gonna cool his hot heart with a cool island song.,6,Southpark,89,15,,,,,,,,,
57007,Cartman,9,"...No, he has an icy heart.",6,Southpark,27,6,,,,,,,,,
57008,Kyle,9,"...But you can't melt ice with a cool song, 'tardheart.",6,Southpark,55,10,,,,,,,,,
57009,Stan,9,"So we have to warm his icy heart with a ""hot"" island song",6,Southpark,57,13,,,,,,,,,
57010,Cartman,9,It's a cool island song.,6,Southpark,24,5,,,,,,,,,
57011,Kyle,9,Well then we're gonna end up freezing his hellish heart with a cool island song.,6,Southpark,80,15,,,,,,,,,
57012,Cartman,9,"Oh, do we wanna do that?",6,Southpark,24,6,,,,,,,,,
57016,Stan,9,"Those rams can do to us what they will, Mr. Lucas, but we'll never stop trying to protect films. ",6,Southpark,97,19,,,,,,,,,
57017,Kyle,9,"It's not too late to do what's right. Give us the print. There's still some good in you, Mr. Lucas. We know there is. ",6,Southpark,118,24,,,,,,,,,
57019,Kyle,9,You yourself led the campaign against the colorization of films. You understand why films shouldn't be changed.,6,Southpark,111,17,,,,,,,,,
57021,Stan,9,"You're wrong, Mr. Lucas. They're not your movies. They're ours. All of ours. We paid to go see them, and they're just as much a part of our lives as they are of yours.",6,Southpark,167,34,,,,,,,,,
57022,Kyle,9,"When an artist creates, whatever they create belongs to society",6,Southpark,63,10,,,,,,,,,
57024,Stan,9,Give the print to us so that we can protect it from Spielberg and anyone else who wants to alter it.,6,Southpark,100,21,,,,,,,,,
57031,Kyle,9,Don't listen to him! You still have a chance to preserve your film! ,6,Southpark,68,13,,,,,,,,,
57034,Kyle,9,What??,6,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
57036,Stan,9,"Fuck you, Steven Spielberg! Come on, you guys! ",6,Southpark,47,8,,,,,,,,,
57071,Cartman,9,Wow.,6,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
57073,Cartman,9,AY!,6,Southpark,3,1,,,,,,,,,
57076,Stan,9,He's definitely lost it,6,Southpark,23,4,,,,,,,,,
57077,Kyle,9,Yup.,6,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
57079,Kyle,9,"Come on, Tweek! Blow it up!",6,Southpark,27,6,,,,,,,,,
57088,Stan,9,"You guys, close your eyes. Don't look at it.",6,Southpark,44,9,,,,,,,,,
57090,Stan,9,"Don't watch the movie, you guys. It'll be terrible. Close your eyes! ",6,Southpark,69,12,,,,,,,,,
57097,Stan,9,"Yuh, you guys okay. ",6,Southpark,20,4,,,,,,,,,
57098,Kyle,9,Yeah. I I think so.,6,Southpark,19,5,,,,,,,,,
57099,Cartman,9,"Man, that new version must have sucked balls.",6,Southpark,45,8,,,,,,,,,

57109,Stan,9,"Come on, you guys. Let's get out of here. ",6,Southpark,42,9,,,,,,,,,
57111,Kyle,9,"Do you think we did a good thing, Stan?  I mean, no one even seemed to notice.",6,Southpark,78,17,,,,,,,,,
57112,Stan,9,"Yeah well, sometimes the things we do don't matter right now. Sometimes they matter... later. We have to care more about later sometimes, you know? I think that's what separates us from the Steven Spielbergs and George Lucases of the world.",6,Southpark,240,41,,,,,,,,,
57113,Cartman,9,That and youth. Those guys are old.,6,Southpark,35,7,,,,,,,,,
57115,Stan,9,"Don't worry, Tweek. It's somewhere safe. Somewhere where... nobody will ever find it.",6,Southpark,85,13,,,,,,,,,
57117,Stan,10,"Hi. Uh, the school called and said we all have to start going to class again.",6,Southpark,77,16,,,,,,,,,
57119,Kyle,10,"She did, but now they're saying we have to start going back to school anyways. It's totally gay.",6,Southpark,96,18,,,,,,,,,
57122,Cartman,10,"Hello, Precious. Yes, that's a good Precious.  Now it takes the lotion from the basket.",6,Southpark,87,15,,,,,,,,,
57124,Cartman,10,It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.,6,Southpark,62,14,,,,,,,,,
57126,Cartman,10,"Yes, that's a good Precious. Okay, now it puts the lotion back in the basket.",6,Southpark,77,15,,,,,,,,,
57128,Cartman,10,It puts the lotion back in the basket!,6,Southpark,38,8,,,,,,,,,
57130,Cartman,10,Put the lotion in the fuckin' basket!,6,Southpark,37,7,,,,,,,,,
57132,Cartman,10,Yes Mom?,6,Southpark,8,2,,,,,,,,,
57134,Cartman,10,"...No, our teacher's dead. Remember?",6,Southpark,36,5,,,,,,,,,
57136,Cartman,10,Two weeks isn't enough. I'm not over our teacher's tragic death. I'm still sh-shooken up.,6,Southpark,89,15,,,,,,,,,
57138,Cartman,10,But I wanna plaaayyy.,6,Southpark,21,4,,,,,,,,,
57146,Cartman,10,"Mr. Mackey, I don't think I'm over the teacher's tragic death yet. I need more time. It's just... it still hurts, you know? Can I go home?",6,Southpark,138,27,,,,,,,,,
57148,Kyle,10,"Dude, look at Bebe.  Something seems different about her.",6,Southpark,57,9,,,,,,,,,
57149,Stan,10,"Yeah, I noticed that too. Did she get a haircut or something?",6,Southpark,61,12,,,,,,,,,
57150,Kyle,10,I don't know. ,6,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,
57153,Butters,10,"Yeah. Bebe is kinda cool, huh? ",6,Southpark,31,6,,,,,,,,,
57154,Cartman,10,"Hey Craig, is that the same shirt that that Bebe chick always wears?",6,Southpark,68,13,,,,,,,,,
57156,Cartman,10,It just... it just seems like a really awesome shirt.,6,Southpark,53,10,,,,,,,,,
57163,Kyle,10,Dude! Bebe is really smart!,6,Southpark,27,5,,,,,,,,,
57164,Stan,10,Yeah. I never noticed that before. Maybe she's actually cool enough to hang out with us.,6,Southpark,88,16,,,,,,,,,
57165,Cartman,10,"Yeah, may be.",6,Southpark,13,3,,,,,,,,,
57167,Stan,10,"Ah, hey, Bebe.",6,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,
57169,Stan,10,"Uh, we're gonna throw rocks at cars later on, and we thought maybe you'd like to join us.",6,Southpark,89,18,,,,,,,,,
57171,Butters,10,"Wuuhh, it's really fun.You toss these little rocks at cars, and if the driver gets angry, you blame me.",6,Southpark,103,19,,,,,,,,,
57172,Kyle,10,"Yeah, it's cool.",6,Southpark,16,3,,,,,,,,,
57175,Kyle,10,Yeah.,6,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,

57180,Stan,10,"Cool.  We'll see you later, Bebe.",6,Southpark,33,6,,,,,,,,,
57182,Stan,10,"That's different, dude. You're like, my girlfriend. Bebe's just... I don't know. She's just cool. ",6,Southpark,98,15,,,,,,,,,
57183,Kyle,10,Yeah. She's really cool. ,6,Southpark,25,4,,,,,,,,,
57185,Stan,10,"So what you do, see, is wait for a car to drive by that big pine tree. Then you chuck a rock at it. It's all about the timing. ",6,Southpark,127,29,,,,,,,,,
57193,Butters,10,Cool!  That was the most perfect throw I've ever seen.,6,Southpark,54,10,,,,,,,,,
57194,Kyle,10,"That was sweet, Bebe.  Now, if you just hold the rock like this, you-",6,Southpark,69,14,,,,,,,,,
57196,Kyle,10,I'm showing her.,6,Southpark,16,3,,,,,,,,,

57202,Kyle,10,Hoh! Hoh hoh hoh hoh! ,6,Southpark,22,5,,,,,,,,,
57203,Stan,10,Hoh hoh hoh!,6,Southpark,12,3,,,,,,,,,
57204,Kyle,10,Hah hah hah!,6,Southpark,12,3,,,,,,,,,
57207,Stan,10,"...Wait, what were we doing again?",6,Southpark,34,6,,,,,,,,,
57208,Kyle,10,We were throwing rocks at cars.,6,Southpark,31,6,,,,,,,,,
57210,Cartman,10,Woohoo.,6,Southpark,7,1,,,,,,,,,
57211,Butters,10,Uh here comes an SUV. ,6,Southpark,22,5,,,,,,,,,
57218,Stan,10,"Hey, that's what I wrote about!",6,Southpark,31,6,,,,,,,,,

57221,Stan,10,"Hah hah, hah!  Uuuuh-okay. Go ahead, Clyde.",6,Southpark,43,7,,,,,,,,,
57234,Cartman,10,"God, you know what, that's so true? Because, you sometimes never really think about how old a pet is until it's gone.",6,Southpark,117,22,,,,,,,,,
57236,Stan,10,That's such a great paper! ,6,Southpark,27,5,,,,,,,,,
57239,Cartman,10,Oh God! Here we go again! Dork alert! ,6,Southpark,38,8,,,,,,,,,
57243,Kyle,10,Maybe she's in the lunch line.,6,Southpark,30,6,,,,,,,,,
57271,Cartman,10,"Yeah, have a seat, Tweek. We all need to have a talk",6,Southpark,52,12,,,,,,,,,
57273,Cartman,10,"Alright guys, now that we're all here, I think... we need to have a difficult conversation. It's obvious that Bebe is the like the coolest, smartest, most awesome person we've ever met.",6,Southpark,185,32,,,,,,,,,
57275,Stan,10,Yeah.,6,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
57276,Kyle,10,Yep.,6,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
57277,Cartman,10,"And, you know, we've been trying to fill the gap for the fourth friend ever since Kenny died, God rest his soul, and it hasn't been an easy process.",6,Southpark,148,29,,,,,,,,,
57278,Kyle,10,Right.,6,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
57279,Stan,10,Uh huh.,6,Southpark,7,2,,,,,,,,,
57280,Cartman,10,"And so, even though I think it's a tough thing to do right now, I think maybe it's best for everyone if we make room to allow Bebe to be our new fourth friend.",6,Southpark,159,34,,,,,,,,,

57422,Randy,10,"I know you think this set of boobs is important now, but those boobs will be replaced by another set of boobs.

57466,Kyle,10,Sssss-so ...Bebe ...didn't become smart and cool? It was just her boobs?,6,Southpark,72,12,,,,,,,,,
57468,Cartman,10,"So, Bebe is actually just as lame as she ever was?",6,Southpark,50,11,,,,,,,,,
57470,Kyle,10,But that sucks. I don't want something to have that much power over me.,6,Southpark,71,14,,,,,,,,,

57573,Randy,11,"Wait, that's it. A wall. We could build a huge city wall all around South Park so that we have complete control over who comes in.",6,Southpark,130,26,,,,,,,,,
57581,Randy,11,Your ancestors put up a great wall that kept Mongolians out for thousands of years. We know you can do it for us.,6,Southpark,113,23,,,,,,,,,
57583,Randy,11,"Stan, our abduction problems are over. We got the new Child Tracker.",6,Southpark,68,12,,,,,,,,,

57599,Stan,11,Huh?,6,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
57601,Stan,11,"But if there is no other team, then it won't be any fun.",6,Southpark,56,13,,,,,,,,,
57602,Randy,11,"Don't worry, it'll still be fun for us. ",6,Southpark,40,8,,,,,,,,,

57714,Randy,11,"No, no. You know who was right all along? The Mongolians.  They knew that you just can't wall yourself off from the outside world. Putting walls up never helps anything. Tearing them down brings us together.",6,Southpark,207,36,,,,,,,,,

57847,Kyle,12,Do you see anything?,6,Southpark,20,4,,,,,,,,,
57848,Stan,12,No. Hello?? Kenny?? God??,6,Southpark,25,4,,,,,,,,,
57849,Kyle,12,Grandma??,6,Southpark,9,1,,,,,,,,,
57850,Cartman,12,"Aw, don't tell me we haven't even reached the cloud city yet!",6,Southpark,61,12,,,,,,,,,
57851,Stan,12,"No cloud city, not even a giant. Heaven must still be a long way off.",6,Southpark,69,15,,,,,,,,,
57852,Cartman,12,"Alright, look. I didn't wanna have to say this, but I think maybe we're not seeing heaven because one of us doesn't believe in it enough.",6,Southpark,137,26,,,,,,,,,
57853,Kyle,12,Huh?,6,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
57854,Cartman,12,Heaven could be like the pixie faeries of Bubble Yum Forest. You only see them if you really believe in them.,6,Southpark,109,21,,,,,,,,,
57855,Stan,12,What??,6,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
57856,Cartman,12,"You know, maybe we're not seeing heaven because one of us is a J-O-O.",6,Southpark,69,14,,,,,,,,,
57857,Kyle,12,What does me being a Jew have to do with anything?!,6,Southpark,51,11,,,,,,,,,
57858,Cartman,12,Because Jews don't believe in heaven!,6,Southpark,37,6,,,,,,,,,
57859,Kyle,12,Yes we do! Just not the Christian heaven!,6,Southpark,41,8,,,,,,,,,
57860,Cartman,12,Right. Your idea of heaven is getting five dollars off your matzah ball soup at Barney's Beanery by lying about a hair in it.,6,Southpark,125,24,,,,,,,,,
57861,Kyle,12,HAAHH!!! ,6,Southpark,9,1,,,,,,,,,
57862,Cartman,12,AH! ,6,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
57863,Kyle,12,Hey Kenny.,6,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,
57864,Stan,12,Hey Kenny.,6,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,
57865,Kenny,12,,6,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
57866,Cartman,12,"In the ghetto, in the ghetto. He's a boy wearing orange, who's losing his pride, 'cause Kenny and his whole family reside in the ghetto, in the ghetto",6,Southpark,150,28,,,,,,,,,
57867,Kenny,12,,6,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
57868,Cartman,12,What did you say?!,6,Southpark,18,4,,,,,,,,,
57869,Kenny,12,,6,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
57870,Cartman,12,What did you say?!,6,Southpark,18,4,,,,,,,,,
57871,Cartman,12,"I said ""Shut up, Cartman, you blood-belching vagina!""  Did I just call myself a blood-belching vagina?",6,Southpark,102,16,,,,,,,,,
57872,Stan,12,"Dude, what the hell is wrong with you??",6,Southpark,39,8,,,,,,,,,
57873,Cartman,12,"I dunno, I just, I keep feeling like I'm Kenny. Seeing memories through his eyes.",6,Southpark,81,15,,,,,,,,,
57874,Kyle,12,You're too fat to be Kenny.,6,Southpark,27,6,,,,,,,,,
57875,Cartman,12,You're a- stupid Jew.,6,Southpark,21,4,,,,,,,,,
57876,Stan,12,Let's just keep building. We only have five more days until the shopping spree.,6,Southpark,79,14,,,,,,,,,
57893,Randy,12,"Boys, it's really neat that you want to see your old pal Kenny so much but...",6,Southpark,77,16,,,,,,,,,
57895,Stan,12,"No, we have to see Kenny!",6,Southpark,25,6,,,,,,,,,
57897,Stan,12,Cremated? What's that?,6,Southpark,22,3,,,,,,,,,
57898,Randy,12,"When you die, your body is put into a broiling oven and cooked until you're nothing but ashes. ",6,Southpark,95,18,,,,,,,,,
57899,Kyle,12,"What?? For God's sake, why??",6,Southpark,28,5,,,,,,,,,
57901,Kyle,12,Are you gonna burn me?,6,Southpark,22,5,,,,,,,,,
57903,Kyle,12,Jesus Christ!,6,Southpark,13,2,,,,,,,,,
57904,Randy,12,"The person's ashes are put into an urn, and that's where Kenny's body is.",6,Southpark,73,14,,,,,,,,,
57906,Cartman,12,"Alright, alright, I drank the chocolate milk mix and replaced it with kitty litter.",6,Southpark,83,14,,,,,,,,,
57908,Stan,12,"Dude, don't you know what this means? You drank Kenny!",6,Southpark,54,10,,,,,,,,,
57909,Cartman,12,Shut up!,6,Southpark,8,2,,,,,,,,,
57910,Kyle,12,"You did, dude! You drank his whole body!",6,Southpark,40,8,,,,,,,,,
57911,Cartman,12,Shut up!,6,Southpark,8,2,,,,,,,,,
57914,Cartman,12,That explains it. Why I'm having Kenny's memories all the time. His soul is inside me.,6,Southpark,86,16,,,,,,,,,
57915,Stan,12,"Well, so much for our winning ticket. Cartman probably drank that with the rest of Kenny! ",6,Southpark,90,16,,,,,,,,,
57916,Kyle,12,"Yeah. Good job, fatass! ",6,Southpark,24,4,,,,,,,,,
57917,Cartman,12,"I can't live like this. I, I have to find a place where they remove living souls from your body.",6,Southpark,96,20,,,,,,,,,
57918,Cartman,12,Looks like I've come to the right place.,6,Southpark,40,8,,,,,,,,,
57920,Cartman,12,"Yes, hello. I have a living thing inside of me that needs to be sucked out, please.",6,Southpark,83,17,,,,,,,,,
57922,Cartman,12,Two hundred and thirty dollars?? I just want you to vacuum him out of me and not put him up in a condominium! ,6,Southpark,110,23,,,,,,,,,
57924,Cartman,12,"Listen, lady! You've got to get this crap out of me!  I don't want him in me anymore! Just suck him up and throw him out!",6,Southpark,121,26,,,,,,,,,
57927,Cartman,12,Eh! ,6,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
57928,Cartman,12,Kenny! Kenny! kenny...,6,Southpark,22,3,,,,,,,,,
57929,Stan,12,Kenny! Lolly's Candy Land is giving away a shopping spree!,6,Southpark,58,10,,,,,,,,,
57930,Kyle,12,We're all gonna pitch in on an entry!,6,Southpark,37,8,,,,,,,,,
57932,Stan,12,"Hold on to this, Cartman. I might lose it. ",6,Southpark,43,9,,,,,,,,,
57933,Cartman,12,"Nah, I'll lose it for sure. You keep track of it, Kyle, of it, Kyle, of it Kyle...",6,Southpark,82,18,,,,,,,,,
57934,Kyle,12,"Okay. N-no, ah I don't want that much responsibility-bility. Here, you hold on to it, Kenny. ",6,Southpark,93,16,,,,,,,,,
57935,Kenny,12, ,6,Southpark,1,0,,,,,,,,,
57936,Cartman,12,"You'd better not lose that ticket, Kenny, or else I'll kick you in the nuts! The nuts! The nuts!",6,Southpark,96,19,,,,,,,,,
57937,Cartman,12,The ticket! Kenny didn't have it on him when he died! He put it away somewhere!  Don't you see? I can still have my candy shopping spree! Oh my God!  You guys! YOU GUYS!!,6,Southpark,170,34,,,,,,,,,
57945,Cartman,12,You guys! You guys! I saw the ticket! ,6,Southpark,38,8,,,,,,,,,
57946,Kyle,12,"What do you mean, fatass?",6,Southpark,25,5,,,,,,,,,
57947,Cartman,12,"I just had another vision, you buttholes. Kenny didn't keep the ticket with him, he put it away somewhere.",6,Southpark,106,19,,,,,,,,,
57948,Stan,12,Where??,6,Southpark,7,1,,,,,,,,,
57949,Cartman,12,I don't know. I got conked in the head down at the abortion clinic  and I clearly saw Kenny putting the ticket in a little red box.  I just have to wait for another vision to come. I could clearly see through Ken-  AY! ,6,Southpark,219,44,,,,,,,,,
57950,Kyle,12,Do you see anything?,6,Southpark,20,4,,,,,,,,,
57951,Cartman,12,"Yes, Kyle. I see a DEAD JEW! ",6,Southpark,29,7,,,,,,,,,
57952,Stan,12,Whoawhoawhoa! Maybe Kyle's right. We gotta spark the vision somehow.,6,Southpark,68,10,,,,,,,,,
57953,Cartman,12,Not by giving me brain damage!,6,Southpark,30,6,,,,,,,,,
57954,Stan,12,Do you want a candy shopping spree or not?!,6,Southpark,43,9,,,,,,,,,
57955,Cartman,12,"Alright, go ahead.  AY!... no.  AY!...",6,Southpark,38,6,,,,,,,,,
57957,Randy,12,What? ,6,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
57962,Randy,12,"Oh God, and we told our boys they'd never reach heaven.",6,Southpark,55,11,,,,,,,,,
57966,Randy,12,"If Saddam is building weapons, we have to stop him. With our weapons. ",6,Southpark,70,13,,,,,,,,,
57967,Stan,12,"Ah, excuse me everyone! Uh, we're not working on the ladder anymore. Thank you, we're done. ",6,Southpark,92,16,,,,,,,,,
57970,Kyle,12,"Kenny didn't have the ticket stub. It was in his room. So we got all our candy, and you can all go home.",6,Southpark,104,23,,,,,,,,,
57971,Randy,12,"Wait, are you saying that you boys only wanted to build a ladder to heaven so you could get some candy??",6,Southpark,104,21,,,,,,,,,
57972,Cartman,12,"...I've never heard the words ""only"" and ""candy"" in the same sentence before.",6,Southpark,77,13,,,,,,,,,
57974,Stan,12,"Yeah, well people make us kids believe that heaven is this white place with fluffy clouds and angels...",6,Southpark,103,18,,,,,,,,,
57975,Kyle,12,"Yeah, but now we think maybe heaven isn't a place you can get to, maybe heaven is just an idea. A frame of mind or, or something gay like that. Maybe heaven... is this moment, right now.",6,Southpark,186,37,,,,,,,,,
57978,Randy,12,"No, no. We shouldn't bomb anybody. These boys are right. The only heaven we can hope for is one here on earth, now. We should stop waiting to get into heaven and start trying to... create it.",6,Southpark,191,37,,,,,,,,,
57982,Kyle,12,"Well, I'm sure glad this is all over with. Let's go count our candy.",6,Southpark,68,14,,,,,,,,,
57983,Stan,12,Yeah. But what about Kenny. His soul is still in Cartman's body.,6,Southpark,64,12,,,,,,,,,
57984,Cartman,12,"No no, I just drank his memories. I'm not sharing my body with that poor piece of crap. Stop calling me poor, you fat dick!  ...Oh Jesus Christ.",6,Southpark,144,28,,,,,,,,,
57985,Kyle,12,"Whoa.  Kenny, you in there?",6,Southpark,27,5,,,,,,,,,
57986,Cartman,12,"Stop it! Where am I, you guys? Oh God! ",6,Southpark,39,9,,,,,,,,,
57987,Stan,12,"Dude, come back here! ",6,Southpark,22,4,,,,,,,,,
57988,Kyle,12,"Stop him, Kenny! ",6,Southpark,17,3,,,,,,,,,
57996,Stan,13,O Great Wizard of Gregendath. What quest do you ask of this Ranger and Paladin?,6,Southpark,79,15,,,,,,,,,
57997,Cartman,13,Only one thing can save our kingdom. You must bring me: a piece of pecan pie with toffee ice cream and magic shell. Hurry now!,6,Southpark,126,25,,,,,,,,,
57998,Kyle,13,"That quest sucks, Cartman! Think of another one!",6,Southpark,48,8,,,,,,,,,
57999,Randy,13,"Uh, boys,  Butters' parents want to borrow The Lord of the Rings video we rented. Could you take it over to them?",6,Southpark,113,22,,,,,,,,,
58000,Stan,13,You're sending us on... a quest? You ask of us to take the one video to the House of Butters?,6,Southpark,93,20,,,,,,,,,
58001,Randy,13,"Yeah, whatever.",6,Southpark,15,2,,,,,,,,,
58002,Cartman,13,It shall be a long journey with many dangers on the way.,6,Southpark,56,12,,,,,,,,,
58003,Kyle,13,"But if the tape must be brought to the House of Butters, who else can do it?",6,Southpark,76,17,,,,,,,,,
58004,Stan,13,"Very well, we shall embark on this quest immediately, father! Come, warriors!",6,Southpark,77,12,,,,,,,,,
58006,Randy,13,"Hmmm, that gets rid of them.",6,Southpark,28,6,,,,,,,,,
58008,Randy,13,"Yeah, well uh, The Lord of the Rings wasn't the only thing I rented from the video store.  I also rented... a porno.",6,Southpark,116,23,,,,,,,,,
58010,Randy,13,You wanna go watch?,6,Southpark,19,4,,,,,,,,,
58011,Stan,13,How shall we journey to the house of Butters? Through the mines of Endor or over the mountains of Grog?,6,Southpark,103,20,,,,,,,,,
58012,Kyle,13,Look out! Here comes the great dragon of Perengraph!,6,Southpark,52,9,,,,,,,,,
58013,Cartman,13,Don't worry! I am the great wizard Motortart. I can shield us from the dragon's fire. ,6,Southpark,86,16,,,,,,,,,
58014,Stan,13,"Good job, wizard.",6,Southpark,17,3,,,,,,,,,
58015,Cartman,13,"And so the party journeyed onward: the great Wizard, the skillful Ranger, and the covetous Jew.",6,Southpark,95,16,,,,,,,,,
58016,Kyle,13,"I'm a Paladin, Cartman!",6,Southpark,23,4,,,,,,,,,
58017,Cartman,13,Jews can't be Paladins.,6,Southpark,23,4,,,,,,,,,
58019,Randy,13,"You ready for some hot, steamy fun?",6,Southpark,35,7,,,,,,,,,
58021,Randy,13,"The guys at the office told me I had to rent this porno. They said, ""this is without a doubt the hottest porno ever made."" ",6,Southpark,123,25,,,,,,,,,
58023,Randy,13,I love that lingerie.  Yeah. You like that?,6,Southpark,43,8,,,,,,,,,
58025,Randy,13,"Yeeaahhh.  Alright, you ready?",6,Southpark,30,4,,,,,,,,,
58027,Randy,13,"Oh, yeah. ",6,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,
58029,Randy,13,"Aw man, I hate when pornos try to have a story.",6,Southpark,47,11,,,,,,,,,
58031,Randy,13,Oh yeah. ,6,Southpark,9,2,,,,,,,,,
58034,Randy,13,"Yeah, it almost looks like... The Lord of the--  Oh, my God!  This is Lord of the Rings!",6,Southpark,88,18,,,,,,,,,
58036,Randy,13,The boys have the hottest porno ever made.,6,Southpark,42,8,,,,,,,,,
58038,Stan,13,My father has asked that we bring you this copy of Lord of the Rings.,6,Southpark,69,15,,,,,,,,,
58040,Cartman,13,Perhaps a reward is in order. Gold? Frankensteincense?,6,Southpark,54,8,,,,,,,,,
58042,Cartman,13,"Man, that's crap.",6,Southpark,17,3,,,,,,,,,
58044,Butters,13,"Oh, boy! Finally I get to see it!",6,Southpark,33,8,,,,,,,,,
58046,Butters,13,"Ah I won't get scared, Mom. Promise!",6,Southpark,36,7,,,,,,,,,
58048,Butters,13,Ooh la lolly! I finally get to see Lord of the Rings. ,6,Southpark,54,12,,,,,,,,,
58050,Butters,13,"Whoa.  Neat-o.  Well, this is good.",6,Southpark,35,6,,,,,,,,,
58052,Randy,13,"Calm down, maybe the boys haven't gotten there yet.",6,Southpark,51,9,,,,,,,,,
58053,Cartman,13,And so the party returns home after completing their great quest.,6,Southpark,65,11,,,,,,,,,
58054,Stan,13,The one tape was returned and South Park was again at peace. ,6,Southpark,61,12,,,,,,,,,
58055,Kyle,13,Quick! A monster of Rivendell!,6,Southpark,30,5,,,,,,,,,
58056,Cartman,13,Prepare for battle! ,6,Southpark,20,3,,,,,,,,,
58058,Randy,13,Boys! Boys!  Where's the videotape?,6,Southpark,35,5,,,,,,,,,
58059,Stan,13,We gave it to the parents of Butters as commanded by you.,6,Southpark,57,12,,,,,,,,,
58061,Randy,13,"Well, wait a minute, uhhh, boys, do you think you can go get that tape back for us really fast? ",6,Southpark,96,20,,,,,,,,,
58062,Cartman,13,This sounds like a really important quest.,6,Southpark,42,7,,,,,,,,,
58063,Randy,13,"Yes, it is. It is more important than anything I've ever asked you to do. You must retrieve the tape. But do not look at it, uh, for it... holds an evil power! Retrieve the tape, and return it to us at home.  Do this, and you will be greatly rewarded.",6,Southpark,251,51,,,,,,,,,
58064,Stan,13,Woww.,6,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
58065,Cartman,13,This... is so cool.,6,Southpark,19,4,,,,,,,,,
58066,Kyle,13,"Gentlemen, we are off! ",6,Southpark,23,4,,,,,,,,,
58067,Randy,13,"Okay, problem solved.",6,Southpark,21,3,,,,,,,,,
58069,Butters,13,"Oh golly.  Hey, what's happening down there? ",6,Southpark,45,7,,,,,,,,,
58070,Stan,13,We have come to reclaim the one tape! ,6,Southpark,38,8,,,,,,,,,
58071,Butters,13,"Wha-wha, what are you doing?! ",6,Southpark,30,5,,,,,,,,,
58072,Kyle,13,The Queen and King of Stan'ses house wish The Lord of the Rings returned to them.,6,Southpark,81,16,,,,,,,,,
58073,Butters,13,"But it's the greatest movie I have ever seen. You guys were right. Lord of the Rings is awesome. Eh, you have to let me finish watching it.",6,Southpark,139,28,,,,,,,,,
58074,Cartman,13,"Nay, Butters! The one tape must be brought back to Stan'ses house. ",6,Southpark,67,12,,,,,,,,,
58075,Butters,13,Bwaagghh! ,6,Southpark,10,1,,,,,,,,,
58076,Kyle,13,Butters! We said you can't watch it! We have a quest!,6,Southpark,53,11,,,,,,,,,
58077,Butters,13,"Well, then... then let me go with you.",6,Southpark,38,8,,,,,,,,,
58078,Kyle,13,"Okay, fine, Butters. But if you're gonna hang out with us, you have to play like Lord of the Rings. ",6,Southpark,100,20,,,,,,,,,
58079,Butters,13,"Wuh, okay.  Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, yeah.",6,Southpark,42,8,,,,,,,,,
58080,Kyle,13,"Butters, what the hell are you doing?!",6,Southpark,38,7,,,,,,,,,
58081,Butters,13,"Playing Lord of the Rings.  Ugh, wegh, oh yeah.",6,Southpark,47,9,,,,,,,,,
58082,Kyle,13,"Get the hell off me! You're a freak, Butters! You can't play with us!",6,Southpark,69,14,,,,,,,,,
58083,Butters,13,Let me have the tape!,6,Southpark,21,5,,,,,,,,,
58084,Stan,13,"No, we have to return it! ",6,Southpark,26,6,,,,,,,,,
58085,Butters,13,My movie!  My awesome cool movie. My... precious.,6,Southpark,49,8,,,,,,,,,
58086,Cartman,13,And so the tape was again retrieved to be brought back to Stan'ses house.,6,Southpark,73,14,,,,,,,,,
58087,Kyle,13,This copy of Lord of the Rings made the young Butters behave quite awfully.,6,Southpark,75,14,,,,,,,,,
58088,Stan,13,"Yeah, and mine parents were acting strange about it, too.",6,Southpark,57,10,,,,,,,,,
58089,Cartman,13,Perhaps the one videotape has some power we have not foreseen. ,6,Southpark,63,11,,,,,,,,,
58091,Kyle,13,"Oh, crap, the sixth graders!",6,Southpark,28,5,,,,,,,,,
58093,Stan,13,"Nothing.  Hey, kid!",6,Southpark,19,3,,,,,,,,,
58095,Cartman,13,You're gay!,6,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
58098,Stan,13,Give it back! We're on a quest to return it to my parents!,6,Southpark,58,13,,,,,,,,,
58100,Kyle,13,You can't keep it.,6,Southpark,18,4,,,,,,,,,
58102,Stan,13,There's four of us! Kenny's soul is still trapped in Cartman's body!,6,Southpark,68,12,,,,,,,,,
58103,Cartman,13,Yeah!,6,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
58105,Kyle,13,"Dude, that video is making people act strange.",6,Southpark,46,8,,,,,,,,,
58106,Cartman,13,The one tape must be returned!  Run! ,6,Southpark,37,7,,,,,,,,,
58109,Randy,13,"Uh... Chris, are the boys over here?",6,Southpark,36,7,,,,,,,,,
58113,Randy,13,"We...  Well, this is really sort of funny, but uh, we, we accidently put a...porno in The Lord of the Rings box. ",6,Southpark,113,22,,,,,,,,,
58117,Butters,13,The precious?  Could you bring back my precious?,6,Southpark,48,8,,,,,,,,,
58119,Butters,13,"They took his precious, took it away to watch without him.  He was really enjoying that movie, too! My... precious.",6,Southpark,115,20,,,,,,,,,
58120,Randy,13,The boys must've come and saw what it was and... then taken it away somewhere.,6,Southpark,78,15,,,,,,,,,
58122,Kyle,13,We can't let those sixth graders get their hands on this videotape.,6,Southpark,67,12,,,,,,,,,
58123,Cartman,13,"I must say I agree. If this copy of The Lord of the Rings is tainted, it would not be safe in the wrong hands.",6,Southpark,110,25,,,,,,,,,
58125,Stan,13,"Oh crap, dude!",6,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,
58126,Kyle,13,Hide! ,6,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
58128,Stan,13,Ogh. ,6,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
58129,Kyle,13,Phew. The one videotape is sought after indeed.,6,Southpark,47,8,,,,,,,,,
58130,Stan,13,"Yeah. Butters, my parents, now the sixth graders.",6,Southpark,49,8,,,,,,,,,
58131,Cartman,13,"Come, guys. We must bring this all to the attention of the High Elf of Paragon.",6,Southpark,79,16,,,,,,,,,
58132,Kyle,13,"Yeah, the High Elf. He'll know what to do. ",6,Southpark,43,9,,,,,,,,,
58133,Randy,13,And so that's the situation. All the boys are out there somewhere with a... pornographic videotape.,6,Southpark,99,16,,,,,,,,,
58136,Randy,13,I'm a...fraid it was... Backdoor Sluts 9. ,6,Southpark,42,7,,,,,,,,,
58147,Randy,13,"It-it can't hurt 'em that much, can it?",6,Southpark,39,8,,,,,,,,,
58148,Butters,13,Precious.  Let me see my precious.  Plee-ee-ee-ease! ,6,Southpark,53,7,,,,,,,,,
58149,Cartman,13,Open.  Bellog. ,6,Southpark,15,2,,,,,,,,,
58151,Stan,13,We must speak with the High Elf of Paragon.,6,Southpark,43,9,,,,,,,,,
58153,Kyle,13,We have in our possession something of great power.  It is... The Lord of the Rings.,6,Southpark,84,16,,,,,,,,,
58155,Stan,13,"Yes, but this is not a--  Wow, twelve hours? ...Yes, but this is not a normal copy. It's making people act really strange. ",6,Southpark,123,23,,,,,,,,,

58221,Randy,13,"Yes, uh... you see, Token... that was called a pornographic film. I-it shows adult men and adult women having sexual intercourse.  Well, y-you see, when a, when a man and a woman fall in love, the man puts his penis in the woman's vagina. It's called love-making, and it's part of being in love.",6,Southpark,295,54,,,,,,,,,

58318,Randy,13,Boys! Boys!,6,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
58320,Cartman,13,And perhaps they would. But for now the sixth grader army was defeated.,6,Southpark,71,13,,,,,,,,,
58321,Randy,13,There you are!,6,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,
58323,Stan,13,"Oh hey guys, uh... We were just about to come home. We had to return the video.",6,Southpark,79,17,,,,,,,,,
58324,Randy,13,"A-alright, now, now listen, kids. There's some things we need to put into context for you. You see, a man puts his penis into a woman's vagina for both love and pleasure. But sometimes the woman lays on top of the man facing the other way so that they can put each other's genitals in their mouths.  Uh, this is called ""69ing"" and it's normal.",6,Southpark,343,65,,,,,,,,,
58328,Randy,13,That's right. It's something adults can do with really good friends in a comfortable setting.,6,Southpark,93,15,,,,,,,,,

58341,Mr. Garrison,14,"Wow, that's... really great to hear.",6,Southpark,36,6,,,,,,,,,
58343,Mr. Garrison,14,"Oh, for real? You're not kidding?",6,Southpark,33,6,,,,,,,,,
58345,Mr. Garrison,14,"Oh, this is all just... this is a dream come true!  Thank you, Principal Victoria! I'll do a great job!",6,Southpark,103,20,,,,,,,,,

58361,Mr. Garrison,14,"Thank you, Mr. Mackey.",6,Southpark,22,4,,,,,,,,,
58363,Mr. Garrison,14,"Okay, children, now for those of you who are new, my name is  Mr. Garrison.",6,Southpark,75,15,,,,,,,,,
58364,Butters,14,"Where is Mr. Hat, sir?",6,Southpark,22,5,,,,,,,,,
58365,Mr. Garrison,14,"Well, I was informed that fourth graders are a little too old for Mr. Hat.",6,Southpark,74,15,,,,,,,,,
58366,Kyle,14,Two-year-olds are too old for Mr. Hat.,6,Southpark,38,7,,,,,,,,,
58367,Mr. Garrison,14,But it's okay because I found a new teacher's assistant. Say hello to...  Mr. Slave. ,6,Southpark,85,15,,,,,,,,,
58369,Mr. Garrison,14,"So that's  Mr. Slave.  The teacher's assistant.  Or, as I like to write for short, the Teacher's Ass.",6,Southpark,101,18,,,,,,,,,
58371,Mr. Garrison,14,"Okay, Mr. Slave. Go sit until I need you. ",6,Southpark,42,9,,,,,,,,,

58376,Mr. Garrison,14,"Eheh, the first thing we're gonna be learning about is communist Russia. ",6,Southpark,73,12,,,,,,,,,
58377,Cartman,14,"No, Kenny. What are you doing, Kenny?",6,Southpark,37,7,,,,,,,,,
58378,Mr. Garrison,14,"Now, Stalin was a big silly when it came to...",6,Southpark,46,10,,,,,,,,,
58379,Cartman,14,"Kenny, no! Don't do it, Kenny! ",6,Southpark,31,6,,,,,,,,,
58380,Mr. Garrison,14,"Eric, did you just throw a paper airplane?!",6,Southpark,43,8,,,,,,,,,
58381,Cartman,14,"No, it was Kenny!",6,Southpark,17,4,,,,,,,,,
58382,Mr. Garrison,14,"Very funny, Eric! Kenny's dead!",6,Southpark,31,5,,,,,,,,,
58383,Stan,14,"Yeah, but Cartman drank Kenny's remains, and now Kenny's soul is trapped in Cartman's body.",6,Southpark,91,15,,,,,,,,,
58385,Mr. Garrison,14,That does it! I will not put up with foolishness in my class! It's time for punishment!  Take it Mr. Slave! ,6,Southpark,108,21,,,,,,,,,
58387,Mr. Garrison,14,"I will  NOT put up with  TOM foolery in my  CLASS room, children.  Mr. Slave, put this rubber ball in your mouth.  Take that, Slavey! take it!  This'll get me fired for sure. ",6,Southpark,175,33,,,,,,,,,
58390,Randy,14,"Well I think in the fourth chapter, when uh Nancy Drew discovers the bloody glove in the cheerleader's locker, well that uh that was just a brilliantly written passage. ",6,Southpark,169,29,,,,,,,,,
58392,Kyle,14,"Hey guys, can we talk to you? ",6,Southpark,30,7,,,,,,,,,
58395,Kyle,14,"Uhh, not cool.",6,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,
58398,Stan,14,"No, no, he said not cool. We got our new teacher today; it's, it's Mr. Garrison, our old third grade teacher.",6,Southpark,109,21,,,,,,,,,
58400,Kyle,14,"Well, he has this new teacher's assistant, and uh and they're both... totally gay.",6,Southpark,82,14,,,,,,,,,
58402,Stan,14,"Yeah but, these guys are really super-gay.",6,Southpark,42,7,,,,,,,,,
58403,Randy,14,"Aw I'm surprised at you, Stanley. I really thought you knew how to accept people for what they were.",6,Southpark,100,19,,,,,,,,,
58405,Randy,14,"No buts, Stanley! We're not raising our kids to be discriminators!",6,Southpark,66,11,,,,,,,,,

58434,Randy,14,That's our Cartman. ,6,Southpark,20,3,,,,,,,,,
58436,Randy,14,"Now do you see why tolerance is so important, boys?",6,Southpark,51,10,,,,,,,,,
58437,Stan,14,I guess.,6,Southpark,8,2,,,,,,,,,
58450,Mr. Garrison,14,"Okay, children, let's take our seats. Uh, apparently, none of you tried to get me fired yesterday, so I guess we're just gonna have to go on and learn more today.  Now who can tells me what happens to water when we heat it up in the Bunsen burner?",6,Southpark,247,49,,,,,,,,,
58451,Butters,14,It evaporates.,6,Southpark,14,2,,,,,,,,,
58452,Mr. Garrison,14,"Good, Butters. Now if we take the glass tube of the Bunsen burner, we can also see how other things react.  Evaporation is an exothermic reaction, so let's look at an endothermic one. Mr. Slave, position 7 please.  Now I'm gonna put the glass tube under Mr. Slave's tight ass.  The heat from Mr. Slave's ass will act as our new conductor of energy",6,Southpark,347,64,,,,,,,,,
58454,Mr. Garrison,14,"Okay, now Butters, could you bring over Lemmiwinks for me please?",6,Southpark,65,11,,,,,,,,,

58456,Stan,14,"Oh, no, no, no no no no.",6,Southpark,24,7,,,,,,,,,
58457,Mr. Garrison,14,Newton was the first to discover that for every action there's a reaction - thank you Butters. Now what do you think is gonna happen when I introduce the element of the gerbil to the endothermic heat of Mr. Slave's ass?  Well let's see. ,6,Southpark,237,44,,,,,,,,,
58459,Butters,14,Lemmiwinks? NO!,6,Southpark,15,2,,,,,,,,,

58467,Kyle,14,"Gays, I guess.",6,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,
58468,Chef,14,"Now why do you wanna go be intolerant of gay people, children?  I thought you knew better.",6,Southpark,90,17,,,,,,,,,
58469,Stan,14,"Well we didn't think we were, but Mr. Garrison has this new assistant, and we're really uncomfortable around him.",6,Southpark,113,19,,,,,,,,,
58470,Chef,14,"Children, a lot of times the reason get uncomfortable around gay people is that they have some issues themselves. You have to ask yourself, ""What is it about their behavior that, for some reason, makes me uncomfortable?""",6,Southpark,220,37,,,,,,,,,
58471,Kyle,14,"Well, I guess it's mostly the way Mr. Garrison stuck a gerbil up Mr. Slave's ass.",6,Southpark,81,16,,,,,,,,,
58472,Chef,14,"Right. And you see, children, that's why you need to- Whoa! What?!",6,Southpark,66,12,,,,,,,,,
58473,Stan,14,Are we homophobes now?,6,Southpark,22,4,,,,,,,,,
58474,Kyle,14,"We don't wanna be gay bashers, Chef.",6,Southpark,36,7,,,,,,,,,
58475,Chef,14,"Children, there's a BIG difference between gay people and Mr. Garrison! Do you understand that??",6,Southpark,96,15,,,,,,,,,
58476,Stan,14,N-no?,6,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
58477,Chef,14,You children just take your lunches. I'm gonna have a talk with the principal.,6,Southpark,78,14,,,,,,,,,
58478,Cartman,14,"I'll take three lunches today, please.",6,Southpark,38,6,,,,,,,,,
58479,Chef,14,"You don't need three lunches, Eric! You're fat enough as it is!",6,Southpark,63,12,,,,,,,,,
58480,Cartman,14,"It is my life choice, Chef, and if you don't tolerate it I'll report you to the SEC. ",6,Southpark,85,18,,,,,,,,,
58481,Mr. Garrison,14,"That was a brilliant idea, having me put a gerbil up your ass, Mr. Slave.  Now we'll get fired for sure!",6,Southpark,104,21,,,,,,,,,
58484,Mr. Garrison,14,That's it! They're gonna fire me for being gay! Twenty-five million here we cooome. ,6,Southpark,84,14,,,,,,,,,
58488,Mr. Garrison,14,"You wanted to see me, Principal Victoria?",6,Southpark,41,7,,,,,,,,,
58490,Mr. Garrison,14,"Oh dear, sounds like I'm gettin' fired. ",6,Southpark,40,7,,,,,,,,,
58492,Mr. Garrison,14,"Oh no, you're firing me? Oh well, I can't stop being who I am. I can't help the way God made me. Guess I just have to go.",6,Southpark,121,28,,,,,,,,,
58494,Mr. Garrison,14,...You're not?,6,Southpark,14,2,,,,,,,,,
58496,Chef,14,Sending Chef to a tolerance seminar?! You've got to be fuckin' crazy!!,6,Southpark,70,12,,,,,,,,,
58498,Chef,14,He IS a sick queer!!,6,Southpark,20,5,,,,,,,,,
58499,Mr. Garrison,14,Yeah!,6,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,

58503,Stan,14,We're not staying in class another minute with those queermos!,6,Southpark,62,10,,,,,,,,,
58504,Randy,14,"Well I really thought you boys really learned something in the Museum of Tolerance, but apparently all you learned was new words to call your poor teachers!",6,Southpark,156,27,,,,,,,,,
58505,Butters,14,But they killed Lemmiwinks!,6,Southpark,27,4,,,,,,,,,
58507,Butters,14,Yes sir.,6,Southpark,8,2,,,,,,,,,

58519,Mr. Garrison,14,No! The parents felt so bad that their kids didn't want to attend my class anymore that they wanna give me the Courageous Teacher award this Friday at the Museum of Tolerance!,6,Southpark,175,32,,,,,,,,,
58521,Mr. Garrison,14,"I mean, I stuck a gerbil up your ass and they wanna give me a Goddamn medal!",6,Southpark,76,17,,,,,,,,,
58523,Mr. Garrison,14,"Oh well-  Hey, that's right, Mr. Slave.  The parents have to see for themselves.  The awards ceremony! Well we'll put on a show they'll never forget!",6,Southpark,149,26,,,,,,,,,

58539,Mr. Garrison,14,"There! I've done it, Mr. Slave. The perfect plan to get us fired. You finished your costume design yet?",6,Southpark,103,19,,,,,,,,,
58541,Mr. Garrison,14,What's the matter?,6,Southpark,18,3,,,,,,,,,
58543,Mr. Garrison,14,"Well here, take a Pepto pill. I can't have my teacher's ass under the weather. ",6,Southpark,79,15,,,,,,,,,
58553,Kyle,14,Oh.,6,Southpark,3,1,,,,,,,,,
58554,Stan,14,"Kyle.  Kyle, you have to keep making your macaroni pictures.",6,Southpark,60,10,,,,,,,,,
58555,Kyle,14,Can't... glue... any... more. ,6,Southpark,30,4,,,,,,,,,
58556,Stan,14,"The guards are coming, Kyle. Glue. Glue, damn you!",6,Southpark,50,9,,,,,,,,,
58558,Stan,14,Butters!,6,Southpark,8,1,,,,,,,,,
58559,Butters,14,No more... arts and crafts...,6,Southpark,29,5,,,,,,,,,
58560,Stan,14,Jesus... we have to get out of here. ,6,Southpark,37,8,,,,,,,,,
58564,Cartman,14,"Oh. Uh, nothing. I was just getting back to work.",6,Southpark,49,10,,,,,,,,,
58566,Cartman,14,Nothing.,6,Southpark,8,1,,,,,,,,,
58568,Cartman,14,Yes sir!  Phew. ,6,Southpark,16,3,,,,,,,,,
58570,Cartman,14,"Hey, I was kidding. There's actually two girls hiding down there. Hey! ",6,Southpark,71,12,,,,,,,,,
58574,Mr. Garrison,14,"Get along, little Slave.",6,Southpark,24,4,,,,,,,,,
58575,Randy,14,Oh my God.,6,Southpark,10,3,,,,,,,,,
58577,Mr. Garrison,14,"Ding-ding, ding-ding.",6,Southpark,21,2,,,,,,,,,
58579,Mr. Garrison,14,"Say, Mr. Slave.",6,Southpark,15,3,,,,,,,,,
58581,Mr. Garrison,14,I had a dream last night that you were a real dick.,6,Southpark,51,12,,,,,,,,,
58583,Mr. Garrison,14,"No no, I was the asshole. ",6,Southpark,26,6,,,,,,,,,
58586,Mr. Garrison,14,"Uh, I uh I'm very happy to get this award. Uh but you know what makes me even happier? Sucking balls.",6,Southpark,101,21,,,,,,,,,
58588,Mr. Garrison,14,"It isn't working. Sing your song, Mr. Slave.",6,Southpark,44,8,,,,,,,,,
58592,Mr. Garrison,14,Uh...,6,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
58595,Mr. Garrison,14,"God-damnit, don't you people get it?! I'm trying to get fired here! ",6,Southpark,68,12,,,,,,,,,
58597,Mr. Garrison,14,"Look, this kind of behavior should not be acceptable from a teacher!",6,Southpark,68,12,,,,,,,,,
58602,Mr. Garrison,14,"Tolerant, but not stupid! Look, just because you have to tolerate something doesn't mean you have to approve of it! If you had to like it, it'd be called the Museum of Acceptance!  ""Tolerate"" means you're just putting up with it! You tolerate a crying child sitting next to you on the airplane or, or you tolerate a bad cold. It can still piss you off! Jesus Tapdancing Christ!",6,Southpark,377,69,,,,,,,,,
58603,Randy,14,"He's right. Our boys didn't hate homosexuals, they just hated the way this asshole was acting.",6,Southpark,94,16,,,,,,,,,
58605,Mr. Garrison,14,"Ogh! Okay, so now can I PLEASE get fired and get my 25 million dollars?!",6,Southpark,72,15,,,,,,,,,
58607,Randy,14,"We're sorry, boys. Why didn't you tell us your teachers were acting so over-the-top?",6,Southpark,84,14,,,,,,,,,
58610,Mr. Garrison,14,But this is insane!,6,Southpark,19,4,,,,,,,,,
58622,Cartman,15,Kenny. Can't have Kenny.,6,Southpark,24,4,,,,,,,,,
58635,Cartman,15,"Ey Kenny! God-damn you, Kenny!",6,Southpark,30,5,,,,,,,,,
58636,Chef,15,"Hello there, children.",6,Southpark,22,3,,,,,,,,,
58637,Stan,15,"Chef, Cartman is in the hospital. They think he might die.",6,Southpark,58,11,,,,,,,,,
58638,Kyle,15,"Yeah, and, we don't know whether or not we should care.",6,Southpark,55,11,,,,,,,,,
58639,Chef,15,Well what's wrong with him?,6,Southpark,27,5,,,,,,,,,
58640,Stan,15,"Well, nobody seems to know, but we think it's because he drank Kenny's soul four weeks ago.",6,Southpark,91,17,,,,,,,,,
58641,Kyle,15,"Kenny's ashes were in an urn, and Cartman drank it, thinking it was chocolate milk mix.",6,Southpark,87,16,,,,,,,,,
58642,Chef,15,"Children, why didn't you tell me about this sooner?",6,Southpark,51,9,,,,,,,,,
58643,Kyle,15,"Well like we said, we didn't know whether or not we should care?",6,Southpark,64,13,,,,,,,,,
58644,Chef,15,"Well, you should. Cartman is your friend whether you like him or not! Now, come on! We've gotta get to that hospital!",6,Southpark,117,22,,,,,,,,,
58647,Cartman,15,Hey you guys! How's it goin'?,6,Southpark,29,6,,,,,,,,,
58648,Chef,15,Cartman?,6,Southpark,8,1,,,,,,,,,
58649,Stan,15,"No, that's Kenny.",6,Southpark,17,3,,,,,,,,,
58650,Cartman,15,What the hell are you assholes doing here?!,6,Southpark,43,8,,,,,,,,,
58651,Stan,15,That's Cartman.,6,Southpark,15,2,,,,,,,,,
58652,Chef,15,"Oh my God! Eric, how long have you been channelin' Kenny?",6,Southpark,57,11,,,,,,,,,
58653,Cartman,15,"Oh, about a month.",6,Southpark,18,4,,,,,,,,,
58655,Chef,15,"Kenny? Kenny, do you know what you need to get free?",6,Southpark,52,11,,,,,,,,,
58656,Cartman,15,He's gone again.,6,Southpark,16,3,,,,,,,,,
58657,Chef,15,"Ms. Cartman, we need to get Cartman to a meeting room to speak with people who have crossed over.",6,Southpark,97,19,,,,,,,,,
58659,Chef,15,This hospital isn't gonna do any good. We need to take him to see John Edward.,6,Southpark,78,16,,,,,,,,,
58660,Stan,15,"Hey, I've seen that guy. He has a TV show where he brings people on and talks to their dead relatives.",6,Southpark,102,21,,,,,,,,,
58661,Chef,15,That's right. We have to go see him in New York.,6,Southpark,48,11,,,,,,,,,
58664,Chef,15,Good. You children need to come too. Eric needs all the support he can get right now.,6,Southpark,85,17,,,,,,,,,
58665,Kyle,15,We're gong to New York?,6,Southpark,23,5,,,,,,,,,
58667,Kyle,15,Oh cool. We get to watch a movie?,6,Southpark,33,8,,,,,,,,,
58668,Stan,15,Awesome!,6,Southpark,8,1,,,,,,,,,
58671,Cartman,15,"Ha-heheheh.  That was Kenny laughing, not me.",6,Southpark,45,7,,,,,,,,,
58672,Chef,15,This must be the place.,6,Southpark,23,5,,,,,,,,,
58674,Chef,15,"Don't worry, Eric. I'm sure he will be able to help you.",6,Southpark,56,12,,,,,,,,,
58683,Stan,15,"Uh, over here please?",6,Southpark,21,4,,,,,,,,,
58684,Kyle,15,We have a dead friend.,6,Southpark,22,5,,,,,,,,,
58686,Cartman,15,Kenny!,6,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
58690,Stan,15,We told you that.,6,Southpark,17,4,,,,,,,,,
58692,Kyle,15,Yee-yeah.,6,Southpark,9,1,,,,,,,,,
58694,Chef,15,"Look uh, Mr. Edward, can you just ask Kenny how we can get him out, please?",6,Southpark,75,16,,,,,,,,,
58696,Stan,15,"No no, he's trapped in Cartman's body.",6,Southpark,38,7,,,,,,,,,
58698,Kyle,15,I'm Kyle.,6,Southpark,9,2,,,,,,,,,
58700,Kyle,15,Yeah. My Grandma.  She's here?,6,Southpark,30,5,,,,,,,,,
58702,Kyle,15,Oh my God!,6,Southpark,10,3,,,,,,,,,
58706,Stan,15,Heh hey wait a minute dude.,6,Southpark,27,6,,,,,,,,,
58711,Chef,15,"Aw man, I can't believe I got fooled by that asshole!",6,Southpark,53,11,,,,,,,,,
58712,Stan,15,He seemed better on TV?,6,Southpark,23,5,,,,,,,,,
58713,Chef,15,Yeah. They must edit his shows down on television to only show him getting mostly right answers.,6,Southpark,96,17,,,,,,,,,
58714,Kyle,15,Grandma's watching me. Always watching me.,6,Southpark,42,6,,,,,,,,,
58715,Stan,15,"Dude, you don't believe that guy talked to your grandma, do you? ",6,Southpark,65,12,,,,,,,,,
58717,Chef,15,We've got no choice. The only people I know now who might be able to help Eric are my parents. We'll have to take the next flight to Scotland.,6,Southpark,142,29,,,,,,,,,
58718,Chef,15,"Okay children, this is your flight back to Colorado. Your parents are meeting you at the airport in Denver.",6,Southpark,107,19,,,,,,,,,
58719,Stan,15,We don't get to go to Scotland?,6,Southpark,31,7,,,,,,,,,
58721,Stan,15,"Oh well. Good luck getting Kenny out of you, fatso.",6,Southpark,51,10,,,,,,,,,
58722,Cartman,15,"Thanks, asshole.",6,Southpark,16,2,,,,,,,,,
58723,Chef,15,"Come on, we gotta catch our plane. You children get right on that plane now.",6,Southpark,76,15,,,,,,,,,
58725,Stan,15,That's us. Come on.,6,Southpark,19,4,,,,,,,,,
58726,Kyle,15,Four white birds!,6,Southpark,17,3,,,,,,,,,
58727,Stan,15,Huh?,6,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
58728,Kyle,15,There's four white birds!  This is what Grandma wants? She wants me to attend Jewleeard.,6,Southpark,88,15,,,,,,,,,
58729,Stan,15,"Dude, you were going to see four white birds eventually.",6,Southpark,56,10,,,,,,,,,
58730,Kyle,15,So is it a coincidence that Grandma DID talk to me about going to Jewleeard someday?,6,Southpark,84,16,,,,,,,,,
58731,Stan,15,"Yes. Now, come on. Our plane is gonna leave. ",6,Southpark,45,9,,,,,,,,,
58732,Kyle,15,I'm not going back.,6,Southpark,19,4,,,,,,,,,
58733,Stan,15,What??,6,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
58734,Kyle,15,I have to join Jewleeard and make Grandma proud!  Tell my parents I'll call them. ,6,Southpark,82,15,,,,,,,,,
58735,Stan,15,"Kyle. No, Kyle! Aw crap! ",6,Southpark,25,5,,,,,,,,,
58736,Stan,15,"Hey, uh, I need to talk to Mr. Edward, please.",6,Southpark,46,10,,,,,,,,,
58738,Stan,15,"I'm not here for a reading, I just need to ask him something real quick.",6,Southpark,72,15,,,,,,,,,
58741,Stan,15,Jesus Christ.,6,Southpark,13,2,,,,,,,,,
58745,Stan,15,"Hey uh, I need to ask you a big favor. You, you did a reading on my best friend and uh, well you kind of messed him up.",6,Southpark,119,28,,,,,,,,,
58747,Stan,15,"Look, my friend Kyle won't fly back home to Colorado. All I need you to do is just talk to him and tell him, you know, the whole talking to dead people isn't for real.",6,Southpark,167,35,,,,,,,,,
58749,Stan,15,"Right, but it's not. It's a trick you do and I need you to just let my friend Kyle know that so he can go on with his life.",6,Southpark,123,29,,,,,,,,,
58751,Stan,15,"Yes. We all hear voices in our heads. It's called ""intuition."" Get over yourself and tell my friend it's just for fun.",6,Southpark,118,22,,,,,,,,,
58753,Stan,15,"No, you give them false hope and a belief in something that isn't real.",6,Southpark,71,14,,,,,,,,,
58755,Stan,15,"No dude, you're a douche.",6,Southpark,25,5,,,,,,,,,
58757,Stan,15,Then you're a stupid douche,6,Southpark,27,5,,,,,,,,,
58759,Stan,15,I'm nine years old.,6,Southpark,19,4,,,,,,,,,
58761,Stan,15,"You are so a douche! I'm nominating you for the Biggest Douche in the Universe award, you douche!  Son of a bitch. ",6,Southpark,115,22,,,,,,,,,
58762,Cartman,15,"Hey Kenny! Shut up, Kenny! You shut up, fatass!",6,Southpark,47,9,,,,,,,,,
58765,Cartman,15,Twelve hours?? Jesus Christ!,6,Southpark,28,4,,,,,,,,,
58767,Cartman,15,"Oh, good. ",6,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,
58773,Cartman,15,"Oh for the love of Christ.  I wanna watch, fat boy!  No, Kenny, it's not funny!",6,Southpark,79,16,,,,,,,,,
58774,Stan,15,Kyle! Kyle!,6,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
58775,Kyle,15,"Don't try and stop me, Stan! This is what my grandma wants!",6,Southpark,59,12,,,,,,,,,
58776,Stan,15,"Look, I went and saw that John Edward guy. He's just a big douche.",6,Southpark,66,14,,,,,,,,,
58777,Kyle,15,He's not a douche! He talked to my grandma!,6,Southpark,43,9,,,,,,,,,
58778,Stan,15,"Kyle, you can't ruin your life based on what some douchey psychic said. They all just use a technique called ""cold reading."" They've used it for hundreds of years to make people believe them.",6,Southpark,191,34,,,,,,,,,
58780,Stan,15,"No, he's not.",6,Southpark,13,3,,,,,,,,,
58784,Stan,15,"Alright, look. I'll show you. I just need a volunteer. How about you?",6,Southpark,69,13,,,,,,,,,
58786,Stan,15,"Okay, I'm gonna pretend that a dead person is talking to me about you, okay?",6,Southpark,76,15,,,,,,,,,
58788,Stan,15,"Okay, watch, Kyle. Uh, it's an older man, someone very close to you.",6,Southpark,68,13,,,,,,,,,
58790,Stan,15,"Does this month, November, hold a special significance?",6,Southpark,55,8,,,,,,,,,
58792,Stan,15,"Right, because he's saying, ""Tell her 'Happy Birthday.'""",6,Southpark,56,8,,,,,,,,,
58794,Stan,15,"See, Kyle? I just started with something really vague. I chose an older man because I'm betting that, based on this woman's age, her father is most likely dead. But if her father wasn't dead, I could still say it was some other older man.",6,Southpark,238,45,,,,,,,,,
58796,Stan,15,"I didn't. I just asked her if November meant anything. Her father could have died in November, or Thanksgiving could have been really special for them. But I go with the birthday and validate it now, as if I knew, by saying ""He wishes you a Happy Birthday.""",6,Southpark,257,48,,,,,,,,,
58798,Stan,15,"Okay, I'll just use an old standard. He saying ""the money. Stop worrying about the money.""",6,Southpark,90,16,,,,,,,,,
58801,Stan,15,"No it isn't! When a father dies, inheritance is usually an issue, and money is something everyone worries about.",6,Southpark,112,19,,,,,,,,,
58805,Stan,15,What?! ,6,Southpark,7,1,,,,,,,,,
58808,Stan,15,No wait.,6,Southpark,8,2,,,,,,,,,
58815,Chef,15,Hi Pop.,6,Southpark,7,2,,,,,,,,,
58817,Chef,15,"These are my friends, the Cartmans. ",6,Southpark,36,6,,,,,,,,,
58820,Chef,15,"Hi, Momma! ",6,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
58822,Chef,15,"Mom, this is my friend, Ms. Cartman.",6,Southpark,36,7,,,,,,,,,
58826,Chef,15,"Yeah, Pop. This is Eric.",6,Southpark,24,5,,,,,,,,,
58832,Cartman,15,Right now?,6,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,
58835,Cartman,15,"Whoa, whoa, watch it lady.",6,Southpark,26,5,,,,,,,,,
58840,Stan,15,"Okay, listen to me. Listen very carefully.  This is a trick that I am doing. Okay? Watch. All I'm gonna do is say a name that I'm gonna pick at random. Okay?  They want me to acknowledge Pete, or Peter.",6,Southpark,202,40,,,,,,,,,
58843,Stan,15,"No! Stop clapping! All I did was pick a random name and wait for somebody in the audience to give a response. Now that I see that there's a lone woman crying, my instinct tells me Peter was her husband. So I say, ""Peter was your husband?""",6,Southpark,238,47,,,,,,,,,
58847,Stan,15,Stop it! I didn't do anything!,6,Southpark,30,6,,,,,,,,,
58849,Stan,15,"I didn't start by saying Peter is dead! I started by saying, ""They want me to acknowledge Peter."" That could have meant Peter was in the audience or that Peter was somebody's friend, or Peter had died. I couldn't be wrong, see? Now, I can look at this woman and see that she's fairly young, so odds are her husband was fairly young when he died. So I can say something like, ""I'm getting that Peter's death was very untimely""",6,Southpark,425,80,,,,,,,,,
58854,Stan,15,Okay. Let's back up.  Not literally!,6,Southpark,36,6,,,,,,,,,
58856,Cartman,15,"Ahh, Aahhhh! ",6,Southpark,13,2,,,,,,,,,
58862,Chef,15,The victim child?,6,Southpark,17,3,,,,,,,,,
58865,Chef,15,Where were we gonna find a child to secrifice?,6,Southpark,46,9,,,,,,,,,
58872,Stan,15,"Here. Look, Kyle. I found tons of testimonials on the Internet saying that John Edward has the entire studio wired to hear what people are talking about before the show. And, he pays actors to be plants in the audience.",6,Southpark,219,40,,,,,,,,,
58873,Kyle,15,You're just jealous he's a better psychic than you.,6,Southpark,51,9,,,,,,,,,
58874,Stan,15,"Fine, I give up! You wanna stay in New York?! Then go ahead! ",6,Southpark,61,13,,,,,,,,,
58876,Stan,15,"No, I don't think either of us can. ",6,Southpark,36,8,,,,,,,,,
58878,Stan,15,"I'm saying this to you, John Edward, you are a liar, you are a fake, and you are the biggest douche ever!",6,Southpark,105,22,,,,,,,,,
58880,Stan,15,"Because the big questions in life are tough: Why are we here? Where are we from? Where are we going? But if people believe in asshole douchey liars like you, we're never gonna find the real answer to those questions. You aren't just lying, you're slowing down the progress of all mankind, you douche!",6,Southpark,300,54,,,,,,,,,
58882,Stan,15,"Fine, douche! ",6,Southpark,14,2,,,,,,,,,
58896,Chef,15,What do we do with it now?,6,Southpark,26,7,,,,,,,,,
58898,Cartman,15,"Hey, ah I feel a lot better.",6,Southpark,28,7,,,,,,,,,
58899,Chef,15,"Eric, you're okay! ",6,Southpark,19,3,,,,,,,,,
58904,Stan,15,"No, I don't wanna talk to you. I wanna talk to the audience.",6,Southpark,60,13,,,,,,,,,
58906,Stan,15,"You see, I learned something today. At first I thought you were all stupid, listening to this douche's advice, but now I understand that you're all here because you're scared. You're scared of death and he offers you some kind of understanding. You all want to believe in it so much, I know you do. You find comfort in the thought that your loved ones are floating around trying to talk to you, but think about it: Is that really what you want? To just be floating around after you die, having to talk to this asshole?  We need to recognize this stuff for what it is: magic tricks. Because whatever's really going on in life and in death is much more amazing than this douche. ",6,Southpark,677,126,,,,,,,,,
58908,Kyle,15,"You're right, Stan. My Grandma isn't floating around, judging me and watching what I do. She's dead. Dead and gone forever.",6,Southpark,123,21,,,,,,,,,
58909,Stan,15,Yeah.,6,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
58911,Stan,15,"There's nothing special about you, dude. Get over yourself.",6,Southpark,59,9,,,,,,,,,
58919,Stan,15,"No, it can't be.",6,Southpark,16,4,,,,,,,,,
58924,Stan,15,"Oh, dude! ",6,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,
58927,Stan,15,Now do you people believe me?,6,Southpark,29,6,,,,,,,,,
58929,Cartman,15,God-damnit that was a long flight! I thought we'd never get out of stinky-ass smelly Scotland!,6,Southpark,94,16,,,,,,,,,
58931,Chef,15,"Well, come on. We'd better get Kenny back to his parents. Wait a minute. Who's got the pot roast?",6,Southpark,97,19,,,,,,,,,
58933,Cartman,15,It's still in baggage claims!,6,Southpark,29,5,,,,,,,,,
58934,Chef,15,"Aw, damnit! Come on!  We've gotta find him! Kenny!",6,Southpark,50,9,,,,,,,,,
58948,Kyle,16,"Throw it away, Clyde!",6,Southpark,21,4,,,,,,,,,
58950,Stan,16,What's going on?,6,Southpark,16,3,,,,,,,,,
58951,Kyle,16,Some high schoolers left their marijuana cigarette behind. Uh we have to throw it away before some kids find it or something.,6,Southpark,125,22,,,,,,,,,
58952,Stan,16,So throw it away.,6,Southpark,17,4,,,,,,,,,
58954,Kyle,16,What if the residue gets on our hands and it leads to harder drugs like those commercials say.,6,Southpark,94,18,,,,,,,,,
58957,Stan,16,"You guys, those commercials are just exaggerations.",6,Southpark,51,7,,,,,,,,,
58960,Kyle,16,...Where did you have sex with her?,6,Southpark,35,7,,,,,,,,,
58962,Stan,16,It's just a stupid plant that makes you dumb. Touching it won't hurt you.,6,Southpark,73,14,,,,,,,,,
58963,Cartman,16,"Then you throw it away, smartass. ",6,Southpark,34,6,,,,,,,,,
58964,Stan,16,"Fine, I will.  There, see? I touched marijuana. I'm not a terrorist, I didn't shoot anybody, and I don't feel like doing more drugs now. No big deal.",6,Southpark,149,28,,,,,,,,,
58968,Stan,16,"Aw, come on, Mom.",6,Southpark,17,4,,,,,,,,,
58970,Stan,16,"It's just a show! It doesn't have any fucking effect on me, for fuck's sake!",6,Southpark,76,15,,,,,,,,,
58976,Randy,16,"Who is it, Sharon?",6,Southpark,18,4,,,,,,,,,
58978,Randy,16,Dad?? Look! We don't know you and you don't know us! Just go away before we call the police!,6,Southpark,92,19,,,,,,,,,
58979,Stan,16,"Who the fuck is is, Mom and Dad?",6,Southpark,32,8,,,,,,,,,
58981,Stan,16,I'm me from the past?,6,Southpark,21,5,,,,,,,,,
58983,Randy,16,"Okay, we've had enough!",6,Southpark,23,4,,,,,,,,,
58986,Randy,16,I don't know.,6,Southpark,13,3,,,,,,,,,
58989,Randy,16,How could he possibly know all that unless... he is our son from the future.,6,Southpark,76,15,,,,,,,,,

58993,Randy,16,"Stan, whatever's happened, we going to help you.",6,Southpark,48,8,,,,,,,,,
58999,Stan,16,What?? I have to share my room with my future self?? Oh no! ,6,Southpark,60,13,,,,,,,,,

59003,Stan,16,No.,6,Southpark,3,1,,,,,,,,,
59005,Stan,16,Quit it.,6,Southpark,8,2,,,,,,,,,
59007,Stan,16,Hey guys.,6,Southpark,9,2,,,,,,,,,
59010,Cartman,16,Who's this asshole?,6,Southpark,19,3,,,,,,,,,
59011,Stan,16,This is my future self. He came during the electrical storm last night and is caught in a time matrix. He's me when I'm 32.,6,Southpark,123,25,,,,,,,,,
59012,Kyle,16,Wow. That's pretty cool.,6,Southpark,24,4,,,,,,,,,
59013,Cartman,16,Then how does he know our names?,6,Southpark,32,7,,,,,,,,,

59022,Stan,16,God-damnit!,6,Southpark,11,1,,,,,,,,,
59023,Stan,16,"Thanks for staying after school and tutoring me, Butters.",6,Southpark,57,9,,,,,,,,,
59024,Butters,16,"Uh well, sure thing, Stan. Eh, how come you care about schoolwork all of a sudden?",6,Southpark,82,16,,,,,,,,,
59025,Stan,16,"I told you, I can't stand my future self. I have to do whatever I can to not become a loser like him.",6,Southpark,101,23,,,,,,,,,
59026,Butters,16,"Well, studying is the golden key to the imposing door of success.",6,Southpark,65,12,,,,,,,,,
59027,Stan,16,I just can't stand having my future self around all the time! It's driving me crazy!  Maybe if I get smarter I won't become him and I won't have to share my room!,6,Southpark,162,33,,,,,,,,,
59028,Butters,16,"I know what you mean. I hate having my future self around, too.",6,Southpark,63,13,,,,,,,,,
59029,Stan,16,"Yeah, it's like everything I do, he...  Wait a minute, what'd you say?",6,Southpark,70,13,,,,,,,,,
59030,Butters,16,"I said, I know how you feel. My life has gone completely downhill ever since my future self moved in. I hate him! All he ever wants to do is watch Becker. And that show is so stupid. ",6,Southpark,183,38,,,,,,,,,
59031,Stan,16,"Dude, how long has your future self been around?",6,Southpark,48,9,,,,,,,,,
59032,Butters,16,Oh. I guess it's been around four months now.,6,Southpark,45,9,,,,,,,,,
59033,Stan,16,Four months?? And you never told anybody that you were living with yourself in the future??,6,Southpark,91,16,,,,,,,,,
59034,Butters,16,Nobody asked.,6,Southpark,13,2,,,,,,,,,
59035,Stan,16,Where is he now?,6,Southpark,16,4,,,,,,,,,
59036,Butters,16,Probably watching Becker.,6,Southpark,25,3,,,,,,,,,
59038,Butters,16,"See, here he is. Future Butters. Future self, this is my good friend,-",6,Southpark,70,13,,,,,,,,,
59041,Stan,16,Liver medicine?,6,Southpark,15,2,,,,,,,,,
59042,Butters,16,"Yeah. My future self has a bad kidney from all the drinkin' he did in high school.  I need to learn to behave myself!  Hey! Where are you going, Stan? ",6,Southpark,151,30,,,,,,,,,
59043,Stan,16,"Alright, where is that son-of-a-bitch's wallet?!",6,Southpark,48,6,,,,,,,,,
59044,Butters,16,"Wha-, what are you lookin' for, huh Stan?",6,Southpark,41,8,,,,,,,,,
59045,Stan,16,"Butters, don't you think it's a little bit of a coincidence that both your future self and my future self got caught in a mexterdexed time plane? ",6,Southpark,146,27,,,,,,,,,
59046,Butters,16,"Well they both got the same teacher for homeroom, too, but you didn't say anything then.",6,Southpark,88,16,,,,,,,,,
59047,Stan,16,"Here it is.  It has to be something eh... Wait, what's this?  This expires in two thousand two. Why does he have this in his wallet?",6,Southpark,132,26,,,,,,,,,
59048,Butters,16,I don't follow.,6,Southpark,15,3,,,,,,,,,
59049,Stan,16,"Three four five one Colfax Avenue. Come on, Butters. ",6,Southpark,53,9,,,,,,,,,
59050,Butters,16,Oh! Are we out for an adventure? ,6,Southpark,33,7,,,,,,,,,
59051,Stan,16,Here it is. Motivation Corp. ,6,Southpark,29,5,,,,,,,,,
59052,Butters,16,"I don't think we're supposed to go in there, Stan. Maybe we should go adventurin' somewhere else.",6,Southpark,97,17,,,,,,,,,
59053,Stan,16,"Butters, part of being on an adventure is you go places you're not supposed to go. ",6,Southpark,83,16,,,,,,,,,
59054,Butters,16,"Oh. Well, you're good at adventurin', huh Stan? ",6,Southpark,48,8,,,,,,,,,
59055,Stan,16,What the hell is going on here?,6,Southpark,31,7,,,,,,,,,
59069,Stan,16,I can't believe it! It's all a scam!,6,Southpark,36,8,,,,,,,,,
59070,Butters,16,"Yeah, I can't believe it!",6,Southpark,25,5,,,,,,,,,
59071,Stan,16,They've all been lying to us this whole time!,6,Southpark,45,9,,,,,,,,,
59072,Butters,16,"This whole time! I wonder if my future self knows anything about this?  Hey, maybe my future self remembers this happening, a-and can shed some light on this subject.",6,Southpark,166,29,,,,,,,,,
59073,Stan,16,"Butters, don't you get it?! Those assholes aren't our future selves! Our parents hired them to make us more motivated!",6,Southpark,118,20,,,,,,,,,
59074,Butters,16,"Eh, but then why did they come back to the past",6,Southpark,47,11,,,,,,,,,
59075,Stan,16,"They didn't come back to the past, you dumbass, they're actors!",6,Southpark,63,11,,,,,,,,,
59076,Butters,16,Oh... Oohhhh.  But that's like they're lyin',6,Southpark,44,7,,,,,,,,,
59077,Stan,16,"It is lying, Butters. Your parents lied to you and my parents lied to me! Get it!",6,Southpark,81,17,,,,,,,,,
59078,Butters,16,"Ohhh, that makes me angry! Why, if Professor Chaos were here he'd make everyone pay!",6,Southpark,84,15,,,,,,,,,
59079,Stan,16,Who's that?,6,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
59080,Butters,16,"You know, Professor Chaos, bringer of destruction and disorder!",6,Southpark,63,9,,,,,,,,,
59081,Stan,16,What?,6,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
59082,Butters,16,"Follow me back home, Stan. It's time I let you in on a horrible s-secret! ",6,Southpark,74,15,,,,,,,,,
59083,Butters,16,"Wait right here, Stan. I warn you: you may not like what you're about to see. ",6,Southpark,78,16,,,,,,,,,
59084,Stan,16,We have to teach our parents a lesson! Show them they can't just play with our emotions like that!,6,Southpark,98,19,,,,,,,,,
59085,Butters,16,Now you know my terrible secret!,6,Southpark,32,6,,,,,,,,,
59086,Stan,16,"...You're gay?  It's fine if you're gay, Butters. I don't care.",6,Southpark,63,11,,,,,,,,,
59087,Butters,16,"Huh? Naw, I'm Professor Chaos, Stan.",6,Southpark,36,6,,,,,,,,,
59088,Stan,16,"But we have to teach our parents a lesson, Butters! We're running away! Help me find the perfect place to run away to! ",6,Southpark,119,23,,,,,,,,,
59089,Butters,16,"Mm. Uhm, maybe I used a little too much silver.",6,Southpark,47,10,,,,,,,,,
59090,Butters,16,How about this? Winter Farm. It looks kinda nice.,6,Southpark,49,9,,,,,,,,,
59091,Stan,16,"No, we gotta run away somewhere warm.",6,Southpark,37,7,,,,,,,,,

59094,Butters,16,"Hey look, somebody lost their pet.",6,Southpark,34,6,,,,,,,,,
59095,Stan,16,"Uh, hi, is this the Parental Revenge Center of Western America?  Ah I'm really pissed off at my parents and I wanna impose swift and horrible revenge upon them?",6,Southpark,160,29,,,,,,,,,
59096,Butters,16,"Look, you can make your wiener bigger in just three weeks.",6,Southpark,58,11,,,,,,,,,
59097,Stan,16,"Oh really? Oh, okay, uh where are you located, please?  Great, uumm, can I come by tomorrow?",6,Southpark,92,17,,,,,,,,,
59098,Butters,16,This lady'll massage your wiener for ninety-five dollars. Well that's a pretty good deal.,6,Southpark,89,14,,,,,,,,,
59099,Stan,16,Eleven o'clock is great. Thank you.  That was easy! I just have to go to their office and they'll help me figure out how to get back at my parents!,6,Southpark,147,30,,,,,,,,,
59100,Butters,16,"Hah-hey, I wanna get revenge on my douchebag parents, too.",6,Southpark,58,10,,,,,,,,,
59101,Stan,16,"Fine, then you can come with me. ",6,Southpark,33,7,,,,,,,,,
59102,Butters,16,"Hooray!  And then we can make our wieners bigger, and have the lady massage them.",6,Southpark,81,15,,,,,,,,,
59103,Stan,16,I guess this is it.,6,Southpark,19,5,,,,,,,,,
59104,Stan,16,"Uh hello, we're here about the revenge on our parents?",6,Southpark,54,10,,,,,,,,,
59105,Cartman,16,"Yes, come in, please. ",6,Southpark,22,4,,,,,,,,,
59106,Stan,16,Cartman??,6,Southpark,9,1,,,,,,,,,
59107,Cartman,16,"Oh, Stan, Butters, I didn't know it was you guys.",6,Southpark,49,10,,,,,,,,,
59108,Stan,16,What the hell are you doing here?!,6,Southpark,34,7,,,,,,,,,
59109,Cartman,16,"I'm running a business, Stan. Are you my eleven o'clock?",6,Southpark,56,10,,,,,,,,,
59110,Butters,16,You're the Parental Revenge Center of Western America??,6,Southpark,55,8,,,,,,,,,
59111,Stan,16,"God-damnit, I knew this was too good to be true! Come on, Butters, let's go. ",6,Southpark,77,15,,,,,,,,,
59112,Cartman,16,"Eh, so, you don't want to make your parents suffer and pay for mistreating you, then?  Look, ah, I don't know what your parents did to you, but if you're here, I take it they pissed you off pretty good. Maybe you should at least ...hear what I have to offer?",6,Southpark,258,51,,,,,,,,,
59113,Stan,16,"Oh, sorry. I thought this was a legitimate business!",6,Southpark,52,9,,,,,,,,,
59114,Cartman,16,"That it is, I assure you. I started this business over three months ago from the ground up. I've been helping children get back at their parents ever since.",6,Southpark,156,29,,,,,,,,,
59115,Stan,16,How many parents have you exacted revenge upon?!,6,Southpark,48,8,,,,,,,,,
59116,Cartman,16,"Craig's. a-and Clyde's. Oh and and Kyle's, but that was a freebie. Look, I run a legitimate business here with state-of-the-art computers, charts, and technology. Look around you. I know how it feels to be really, really pissed off at your parents. And I will work hard, for you. ",6,Southpark,280,49,,,,,,,,,
59117,Stan,16,Our moms and dads lied to us about those future selves! It was just a trick to get us to not wanna try drugs or alcohol.,6,Southpark,120,26,,,,,,,,,
59118,Cartman,16,"God-damnit! See? This is exactly why I started this business. If a parent can't respect their child, than who can they respect, huh?",6,Southpark,132,23,,,,,,,,,
59119,Butters,16,Yeah!,6,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
59120,Cartman,16,"Listen! Parents understand one thing, and that's consequences. They need to see consequences from their actions, or else they'll never learn. What my company does is inflicts those consequences upon the parents in a very real and very direct way.",6,Southpark,246,40,,,,,,,,,
59121,Stan,16,How much is this going to cost us?,6,Southpark,34,8,,,,,,,,,
59122,Cartman,16,"Eighteen thousand dollars.  How about just... three hundred and eighty seven easy payments of a hundred ninety nine, ninety five.  How about five bucks?",6,Southpark,152,24,,,,,,,,,
59124,Randy,16,I think he's pretty scared alright.,6,Southpark,35,6,,,,,,,,,
59129,Randy,16,"Well I think when this is all over, our son is gonna thank us.",6,Southpark,62,14,,,,,,,,,
59130,Cartman,16,"Okay, Butters, let's start with you. I think I've found a great way to get revenge on your parents. Just... tell me if I'm going in the right direction here.  What we're going to do, Butters, is we're going to wait for your parents to leave the house, and then, smear all the walls... with poop.",6,Southpark,295,56,,,,,,,,,
59131,Butters,16,Hwuhh. That'll make them awful sore.,6,Southpark,36,6,,,,,,,,,
59132,Cartman,16,"Now, I want you to take a look at some of these poop swatches. ",6,Southpark,63,14,,,,,,,,,
59133,Butters,16,Poop- poop swatches?,6,Southpark,20,3,,,,,,,,,
59134,Cartman,16,"Poop comes in a lot of varieties, Butters. I wanna find the perfect one, tailored to your revenge on your parents.",6,Southpark,114,21,,,,,,,,,
59135,Butters,16,"Hey, that's neato, huh, Stan?",6,Southpark,29,5,,,,,,,,,
59136,Cartman,16,"Now, personally, I like the baby green.  But I also think the classic brown would go nicely with your house.",6,Southpark,108,20,,,,,,,,,
59137,Butters,16,"Wow, Eh eh you sure are a p-professional, Eric! I don't know which swatch I like best.",6,Southpark,86,17,,,,,,,,,
59138,Cartman,16,"Well, y-you know what we could do, uh, uh Butters, is go with the baby green in the living room, and then maybe a classic brown, or even a nut-n-corn crunch in your parents' bedroom.",6,Southpark,182,35,,,,,,,,,
59139,Butters,16,Well that sounds good.,6,Southpark,22,4,,,,,,,,,
59140,Cartman,16,"Okay, well let's do that then. That looks nice.",6,Southpark,47,9,,,,,,,,,
59141,Butters,16,Hooray!,6,Southpark,7,1,,,,,,,,,
59142,Cartman,16,"Alright, now, Stan. For you I've put together a really nice design. I feel your parents were a bit more cocky about lying to you and your revenge needs to reflect that. So what I wanna to is put a note on your parents' door, telling them I'm the counselor from the school.",6,Southpark,272,53,,,,,,,,,
59143,Stan,16,Yeah.,6,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
59144,Cartman,16,"The note will inform them that a problem has come up and they need to see me right-away, back at my office.",6,Southpark,107,22,,,,,,,,,
59145,Stan,16,Yeah.,6,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
59146,Cartman,16,Your parents will drive all the way out to the school and discover that no meeting is actually taking place.,6,Southpark,108,20,,,,,,,,,
59147,Stan,16,Yeah!,6,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
59148,Cartman,16,"And while they're gone, we're gonna smear all their walls with poop. ",6,Southpark,69,12,,,,,,,,,
59149,Butters,16,Wow! Neato!,6,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
59150,Stan,16,"That's not neato, that sucks.",6,Southpark,29,5,,,,,,,,,
59151,Cartman,16,What?,6,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
59152,Stan,16,You're gonna smear Butters' parent's walls with poop. I thought his revenge was unique and customized!,6,Southpark,102,16,,,,,,,,,
59153,Cartman,16,"Poop-smearing is the hot ticket right now, Stan, and... have you seen the poop swatches.",6,Southpark,88,15,,,,,,,,,
59154,Stan,16,"Dude, that's not extreme enough! My parents aren't gonna learn their lesson from having some crap smeared on their walls! I want them to see what they did was wrong! I want them to have them to admit that they lied to me!",6,Southpark,221,43,,,,,,,,,
59155,Cartman,16,"Okay, okay, fine. I I just, I just, ...my first idea. That's why we have these consultations.  Okay, okay, lemme, lemme see here. Uh. Oh wait, oh this is nice. How about this: uh, we'll lure your parents out of the house, and then we'll kill them. Uh, we'll cut them up into little pieces and feed them to the dog",6,Southpark,313,61,,,,,,,,,
59156,Stan,16,Dude!,6,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
59157,Cartman,16,Extreme enough for you? How's Wednesday?,6,Southpark,40,6,,,,,,,,,
59158,Stan,16,"No, that's too extreme!",6,Southpark,23,4,,,,,,,,,
59159,Cartman,16,Well first it's not extreme enough and then it's too extreme; where do you want it?,6,Southpark,83,16,,,,,,,,,
59160,Stan,16,"Just forget it, Cartman! You don't know what you're doing! ",6,Southpark,59,10,,,,,,,,,
59161,Cartman,16,"I'm a professional, suh!  Don't worry about it, Butters. You're gonna be a hundred percent satisfied.",6,Southpark,101,16,,,,,,,,,
59162,Stan,16,Hey future self.,6,Southpark,16,3,,,,,,,,,
59164,Stan,16,"You know that thing that I kept hidden in the hold in the wall for two years that I've never told anybody about?  You know, the thing that I take out of the shoebox every night before I go to sleep?",6,Southpark,198,41,,,,,,,,,
59166,Stan,16,You must know what I'm talking about.,6,Southpark,37,7,,,,,,,,,
59169,Randy,16,"Yeah, Stan, don't be so hard on yourself.",6,Southpark,41,8,,,,,,,,,
59170,Stan,16,"Mom, Dad, I don't think that guy is from the future. ",6,Southpark,53,11,,,,,,,,,
59171,Randy,16,Oh. You. You don't?,6,Southpark,19,4,,,,,,,,,
59172,Stan,16,"No.  You know what I think? I think this is all an elaborate hoax!  And I think that whoever is doing it doesn't have very much respect for me!  See, the best way to try to motivate somebody is by being direct with them, to be honest with them. I think the whole future self thing is a lie, and lies are never the right way to get your message across.",6,Southpark,351,71,,,,,,,,,
59173,Randy,16,"Well, you know what I think, Stan?",6,Southpark,34,7,,,,,,,,,
59174,Stan,16,What?,6,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
59175,Randy,16,I think he IS from the future.,6,Southpark,30,7,,,,,,,,,
59177,Randy,16,"Right. That's mother's intuition; you can't argue with that. No, Stan, I think the only way you're gonna get of him is by staying clear of drugs and alcohol.",6,Southpark,157,29,,,,,,,,,
59179,Cartman,16,"Okay, very nice, very nice. Oh wait, uh, God-damnit! Felipe!  The classic brown poop is supposed to go in the parents' bedroom! The living room is supposed to be all baby green poop!",6,Southpark,182,33,,,,,,,,,
59181,Cartman,16,"ÎçLa caca de moreno no es aqu’_! ÎçAqu’_ es verde, se’±or! ÎçEs verde! ÎçArriba arriba!",6,Southpark,87,15,,,,,,,,,
59183,Cartman,16,"S’_, gracias. ÎèY t’_?  ÎçCarlos! ÎçCarlos, no! We want a textured effect on the nut-n-corn crunch poop. That's why we  spackle with the sponge.  See? Spackle gently. Lo marrado. Gently, see? Marrado.",6,Southpark,200,32,,,,,,,,,
59185,Cartman,16,Marrado. Spectacularrr.,6,Southpark,23,2,,,,,,,,,
59187,Cartman,16,"God, it's so hard to find good help.  Ah! Butters, like what you're seeing so far?",6,Southpark,82,16,,,,,,,,,
59188,Butters,16,"Boy, it sure is stinky in here!",6,Southpark,31,7,,,,,,,,,
59189,Cartman,16,"Yeah, well, three hundred gallons of poop isn't gonna smell like a garden, Butters. But I think it's coming together real nice.",6,Southpark,127,22,,,,,,,,,
59190,Butters,16,"Look, eh, Eric, I've been thinkin', my parents are gonna be awful sore and I don't think-",6,Southpark,89,17,,,,,,,,,
59191,Cartman,16,"Yes, well, I've done my job, haven't I?  ÎçPepite, Pepite, no! No come la taco la trabajar!",6,Southpark,91,17,,,,,,,,,
59193,Randy,16,"Oh, Stan! ",6,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,
59195,Stan,16,"Hide and go seek, huh?!",6,Southpark,23,5,,,,,,,,,
59196,Randy,16,"Yeah, Stan, why don't you go upstairs and play with yourself?",6,Southpark,61,11,,,,,,,,,
59197,Stan,16,I don't believe that he's my future self!,6,Southpark,41,8,,,,,,,,,
59198,Randy,16,"Yeah, but we can't be sure, so we'd better assume he is and never try that first marijuana cigarette, huh?",6,Southpark,106,20,,,,,,,,,
59199,Stan,16,"No, I actually have a way to be sure.  I'm going to cut off my hand. If he is my future self, then his hand will disappear.",6,Southpark,123,27,,,,,,,,,
59201,Stan,16,But I have to know for sure. ,6,Southpark,29,7,,,,,,,,,
59202,Randy,16,"Don't be silly, Stan. You don't wanna go through life without one of your hands. ",6,Southpark,81,15,,,,,,,,,
59203,Stan,16,Maybe it's the hand I smoked that first joint with. Here I go. I'm gonna do it.,6,Southpark,79,17,,,,,,,,,
59204,Randy,16,Stan...,6,Southpark,7,1,,,,,,,,,
59205,Stan,16,Yes?,6,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
59206,Randy,16,Uh... nothing. Go ahead.,6,Southpark,24,4,,,,,,,,,
59208,Stan,16,AAAH! ,6,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
59209,Randy,16,AAAHHH! Oh my God! Look!  What? His hand did disappear! He is you from the future!,6,Southpark,82,16,,,,,,,,,
59211,Stan,16,"That's weird, because I really didn't cut off my hand. It was fake.",6,Southpark,67,13,,,,,,,,,
59212,Randy,16,"Uh..  Look, it was fake in the future, too. ",6,Southpark,44,9,,,,,,,,,

60194,Kyle,3,"Well, YOU don't, because you're a non-caring asshole, Cartman!",7,Southpark,62,9,,,,,,,,,
60195,Cartman,3,"Me??  There's toilet paper on your hands, too, Kyle. ",7,Southpark,53,9,,,,,,,,,

60202,Kyle,3,Ah! Oh God! Oh God!,7,Southpark,19,5,,,,,,,,,
60203,Butters,3,"Hey, uh, you guys here what happened last night? Mrs. Streible's house got covered with toilet paper.",7,Southpark,101,17,,,,,,,,,
60205,Cartman,3,"Yeah? Well, Ol' Mrs. Streible probably had it comin' to her.",7,Southpark,60,11,,,,,,,,,
60206,Butters,3,I don't know. I don't think anybody deserves that kind of brutality.,7,Southpark,68,12,,,,,,,,,
60207,Cartman,3,"Well, I understand the people who did it weren't caughts, so-o... Looks like nobody will ever know the geniuses who masterminded that perfect crime. ",7,Southpark,149,24,,,,,,,,,
60208,Mr. Garrison,3,"Okay children, let's take our seats. Oh, uh, Stan, Kyle, Eric, and Kenny, the counselor wants to see you in his office, now.",7,Southpark,124,23,,,,,,,,,
60209,Cartman,3,Damn!,7,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
60210,Kyle,3,Oh God!,7,Southpark,7,2,,,,,,,,,
60211,Kyle,3,How the hell did they find out it was us that TP'ed that house?,7,Southpark,63,14,,,,,,,,,
60212,Cartman,3,"Will you relax, Kyle?! They have nothing on us! As long as we all stick to our story, we'll be fine.",7,Southpark,100,21,,,,,,,,,
60213,Stan,3,We'd better go over our story again so we don't screw it up.,7,Southpark,60,13,,,,,,,,,
60214,Cartman,3,"Okay. Last night, all four of us were at the bowling alley until about 7:30, at which time we noticed Ally Sheedy, the Goth chick from the Breakfast Club, was bowling in the lane next to us, and we asked her for her autograph, but she didn't have a pen, so we followed her out to her car, but on the way we were accosted by five Scientologists who wanted to give us all personality tests, which were administered at the Scientology Center in Denver until 10:45, at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home and ended up in Rancho de Burritos Rojos, south of Castle Rock, and finally got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger, named Gary Bushwell, arriving home at 11:46.",7,Southpark,705,132,,,,,,,,,
60215,Kyle,3,I'm confused. Did Ally Sheedy take that personality test?,7,Southpark,57,9,,,,,,,,,
60216,Stan,3,"Yes, dude!",7,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,
60217,Cartman,3,"Kyle, it's very simple: we followed Ally Sheedy out to her car, but on the way we were accosted by five Scientologists who wanted to give us all personality tests, which were administered at the Scientology Center in Denver until 10:45, at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home and ended up in Rancho de Burritos Rojos, south of Castle Rock, and finally got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger, named Gary Bushwell, arriving home at 11:46, you got it??",7,Southpark,493,89,,,,,,,,,
60218,Kyle,3,"Ah, Ah I, ah I thought...",7,Southpark,25,6,,,,,,,,,
60219,Cartman,3,"Oh, for Christ's sake!",7,Southpark,22,4,,,,,,,,,
60220,Stan,3,"Look, Kyle, just let Cartman do all the talking, okay? He's better at being in trouble than anybody.",7,Southpark,100,18,,,,,,,,,
60221,Cartman,3,"Thank you, Stan.  Sh sh, here they come, here they come.  ""And so I said, 'That's a terrific joke, Wendy. Tell us another one.'"" Oh, hello, Mr. Mackey. Are you ready to see us now?",7,Southpark,180,35,,,,,,,,,
60223,Kenny,3,,7,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
60225,Cartman,3,"Touch__, Mr. Mackey, touch__.",7,Southpark,29,4,,,,,,,,,
60226,Kyle,3,Why are they doing us one at a time?,7,Southpark,36,9,,,,,,,,,
60227,Cartman,3,"They want to see if we mix the story up, and see if someone will rat out the other three for a better deal.",7,Southpark,107,24,,,,,,,,,
60228,Kyle,3,I can get a better deal?,7,Southpark,24,6,,,,,,,,,
60229,Cartman,3,"Kyle, so help me God, if you Jew us out on this one, I will fucking kill you!",7,Southpark,77,18,,,,,,,,,
60244,Kyle,3,Noo! No.  Noo! ,7,Southpark,15,3,,,,,,,,,
60249,Kyle,3,Oh God! Oh God! I have to tell the truth!  Mooooomm! ,7,Southpark,53,11,,,,,,,,,
60250,Cartman,3,"Hello, Kyle. Going somewhere?",7,Southpark,29,4,,,,,,,,,
60251,Kyle,3,I was... I was just going to get a drink of water.,7,Southpark,50,12,,,,,,,,,
60252,Cartman,3,No need. I have one for you right here. ,7,Southpark,40,9,,,,,,,,,
60253,Kyle,3,Oh. Okay. Thanks.,7,Southpark,17,3,,,,,,,,,
60254,Cartman,3,Is there anything else I can get for you?,7,Southpark,41,9,,,,,,,,,
60255,Kyle,3,"Noo, I'll just... be... going back to bed now.",7,Southpark,46,9,,,,,,,,,
60256,Cartman,3,"You do that. Goodnight, Kyle. ",7,Southpark,30,5,,,,,,,,,
60276,Cartman,3,"Stan, Kenny, can I talk to you guys for a second?  I think we have the counselor and the principal fooled, but we need to talk about Kyle.",7,Southpark,138,28,,,,,,,,,
60277,Stan,3,What about him?,7,Southpark,15,3,,,,,,,,,
60278,Cartman,3,"Come on, you know. He's losing it. He's gonna crack.",7,Southpark,52,10,,,,,,,,,
60279,Kenny,3,,7,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
60280,Cartman,3,Kyle can't take the heat; he's gonna sing like a canary. Then we're all gonna take the fall for what we did.,7,Southpark,108,22,,,,,,,,,
60281,Butters,3,Ha-ey fellas. ,7,Southpark,14,2,,,,,,,,,
60282,Stan,3,Butters. ,7,Southpark,9,1,,,,,,,,,
60283,Cartman,3,"Look you guys, all it takes is for one of us to crack, and we all know who the weakest link is!",7,Southpark,95,22,,,,,,,,,
60284,Stan,3,So what should we do?,7,Southpark,21,5,,,,,,,,,
60285,Cartman,3,We have no choice. We have to kill Kyle.,7,Southpark,40,9,,,,,,,,,
60286,Stan,3,"... Dude, we're not killing Kyle!",7,Southpark,33,6,,,,,,,,,
60287,Kenny,3,,7,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
60288,Cartman,3,Why not?,7,Southpark,8,2,,,,,,,,,
60289,Stan,3,"Kyle's not gonna say anything, alright?",7,Southpark,39,6,,,,,,,,,
60290,Cartman,3,"He almost spilled the beans in the counselor's office! He can't even keep the story straight! I'm telling you guys, he's weak. He's weak, and he'll be the end of all of us. ",7,Southpark,173,33,,,,,,,,,
60302,Kyle,3,"What's this all about, Cartman?",7,Southpark,31,5,,,,,,,,,
60303,Cartman,3,"I just wanted to see how you're doing, Kyle. Why don't we go out for a little boat ride?",7,Southpark,88,19,,,,,,,,,
60304,Kyle,3,A boat ride?,7,Southpark,12,3,,,,,,,,,
60305,Cartman,3,I just thought we should find a private place to... talk.,7,Southpark,57,11,,,,,,,,,
60306,Kyle,3,"Well, okay.",7,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
60307,Cartman,3,"Could you help me put this cement block and chain in the boat?  Okay, let's go.  So how are things, Kyle?",7,Southpark,105,21,,,,,,,,,
60308,Kyle,3,Terrible. Every time I close my eyes I see the house we TP'ed. I see the tears of our art teacher and hear the screams of her daughters.,7,Southpark,136,28,,,,,,,,,
60309,Cartman,3,And you feel like you have to confess.,7,Southpark,38,8,,,,,,,,,
60310,Kyle,3,"I don't know what to do.  Part of me feels like I wanna end it all now.  Tell people what heppened. You know, I never knew how beautiful this pond was before.  So cold. The world can feel like that.  So calm on the outside, as if nothing bad ever happens.  Ow.  What the hell are you doing, Cartman?!",7,Southpark,300,59,,,,,,,,,
60311,Cartman,3,"I'm killing you. But unfortunately I could only afford a Wiffle ball bat, so it's gonna take a while. ",7,Southpark,102,19,,,,,,,,,
60312,Kyle,3,Cartman!,7,Southpark,8,1,,,,,,,,,
60313,Cartman,3,"Don't fight it, Kyle, it will only take longer. Just slip into sweet unconsciousness. ",7,Southpark,86,14,,,,,,,,,
60314,Kyle,3,You wanna kill me?! Fine!  I can't live like this anymore! Go ahead! Do it! ,7,Southpark,76,15,,,,,,,,,
60315,Cartman,3,"Won't be long, Kyle. ",7,Southpark,21,4,,,,,,,,,
60336,Stan,3,"Cartman, what are you doing?",7,Southpark,28,5,,,,,,,,,
60337,Cartman,3,I'm getting rid of our problem. Kyle will be dead in a matter of hours.,7,Southpark,71,15,,,,,,,,,
60338,Stan,3,"You don't have to kill Kyle, dude. The police made an arrest. And the person confessed!",7,Southpark,87,16,,,,,,,,,
60339,Cartman,3,They did?,7,Southpark,9,2,,,,,,,,,
60340,Kyle,3,They did?,7,Southpark,9,2,,,,,,,,,
60341,Stan,3,They say they got the guy that did it down at the police station.,7,Southpark,65,14,,,,,,,,,
60342,Kyle,3,Who confessed? That doesn't make any sense.,7,Southpark,43,7,,,,,,,,,
60343,Cartman,3,But can I still kill Kyyyle?,7,Southpark,28,6,,,,,,,,,
60345,Stan,3,We heard that you have the person who TP'ed the art teacher's house? Is that true?,7,Southpark,82,16,,,,,,,,,
60347,Cartman,3,"Uh, can we see them-him-her?",7,Southpark,28,5,,,,,,,,,

60352,Kyle,3,You con-fessed?,7,Southpark,15,2,,,,,,,,,
60353,Butters,3,"Uh huh. Unh, they said I TP'ed the art teacher's house.  I don't seem to remember it,  but they're pretty sure it was me.  I just can't get my behavior under control!",7,Southpark,166,32,,,,,,,,,
60355,Butters,3,"Yeah. And boy, are they gonna uh let me have it! Just wait till my father gets here!",7,Southpark,84,18,,,,,,,,,
60356,Kyle,3,"You guys, we can't let him do this!",7,Southpark,35,8,,,,,,,,,
60357,Cartman,3,What are you talking about? This is a gift from God. An early Easter present all wrapped up in a pretty ribbon from Jesus Christ himself!,7,Southpark,137,26,,,,,,,,,
60358,Butters,3,"Well I'm just a little asshole, is what I am. When God made me, he must have not been payin' very close attention, 'cause I turned out wrong! Just plain wrong!",7,Southpark,159,31,,,,,,,,,
60359,Kyle,3,"Officer Barbrady, Butters didn't TP that house.",7,Southpark,47,7,,,,,,,,,

60362,Cartman,3,"Wiffle ball, anyone?  Anyone care for a nice game of Wiffle ball?",7,Southpark,65,12,,,,,,,,,
60363,Butters,3,"You know, it's not my parents I'm worried about. It's my girlfriend, Carrie. Why, she lives in Michigan. But when she finds out about this, woooo smokey, is she gonna be sore! She might even break up with me. And it would serve me right, too.",7,Southpark,242,46,,,,,,,,,
60365,Cartman,3,"You see guys, it all worked itself out. Tadow, tadow, how you like me now? Feel a little silly now, Kyle? Tadow, how you like me now?",7,Southpark,133,27,,,,,,,,,
60366,Kyle,3,"I still feel bad, Cartman",7,Southpark,25,5,,,,,,,,,
60367,Cartman,3,What? Hu- How can you feel bad? Somebody else is gonna pay for our crime.,7,Southpark,73,15,,,,,,,,,

60369,Cartman,3,"Bu... ...eh... Kyle, you don't seem to understand. We're we're not gonna get punished for this. Ever.",7,Southpark,101,17,,,,,,,,,
60370,Kyle,3,I know.,7,Southpark,7,2,,,,,,,,,
60371,Cartman,3,"So... so then, how can you feel bad?",7,Southpark,36,8,,,,,,,,,
60372,Stan,3,He feels guilty for doing it and for letting someone else pay for it.,7,Southpark,69,14,,,,,,,,,
60373,Cartman,3,...But he's not gonna get in trouble.,7,Southpark,37,7,,,,,,,,,
60374,Stan,3,"It doesn't matter if you get in trouble of not, you can still feel bad.  I think you're right, Kyle. Maybe we should confess.",7,Southpark,125,24,,,,,,,,,
60375,Kenny,3,,7,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,

60379,Stan,3,"Tomorrow in school we'll all tell the teacher it was us, and let her decide what to do.  And Cartman, if you had any thread of a conscience at all, you'll do the same! ",7,Southpark,168,34,,,,,,,,,
60380,Cartman,3,"Eh buh... eh... eh... Freakin' weirdos, man!",7,Southpark,44,7,,,,,,,,,

60420,Kyle,3,"But, but he's lying! He doesn't have a conscience!",7,Southpark,50,9,,,,,,,,,
60422,Kyle,3,This was supposed to be my story! My coming to terms with a guilty conscience! This isn't fair!,7,Southpark,95,18,,,,,,,,,

60470,Mr. Garrison,4,"Well, I hope you little Commies are pretty pleased with yourselves!  Going out there and protesting America, and then saying on national television that you don't even know who the Founding Fathers are!

60672,Cartman,4,"I learned somethin' today. This country was founded by some of the smartest thinkers the world has ever seen. And they knew one thing: that a truly great country can go to war, and at the same time, act like it doesn't want to.  You people who are for the war, you need the protesters. Because they make the country look like it's made of sane, caring individuals. And you people who are anti-war, you need these flag-wavers, because, if our whole country was made up of nothing but soft pussy protesters, we'd get taken down in a second. That's why the founding fathers decided we should have both. It's called ""having your cake and eating it too.""",7,Southpark,649,118,,,,,,,,,

60913,Stan,5,"I don't know, meh, maybe he can't help it.",7,Southpark,42,9,,,,,,,,,
60914,Kyle,5,"Look, he knows full well what he's doing, and he's just waiting for us to buy into it, and then he'll laugh and point at our faces and say, ""Haha, I got you guys to believe me!"" ""You guys are stupid!""",7,Southpark,200,41,,,,,,,,,
60915,Stan,5,"Dude, do you really he would go through all this just to make us feel dumb?",7,Southpark,75,16,,,,,,,,,
60916,Kyle,5,"YES, dude! ",7,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
60917,Stan,5,"Cartman, we decided that if you can be mature and admit to everyone that you've gotten yourself into this mess, then we'll help you.",7,Southpark,132,24,,,,,,,,,
60918,Cartman,5,"Okay, okay, I know that I control everything Ms. Lopez does.",7,Southpark,60,11,,,,,,,,,
60919,Cartman,5,"Quiet, Ms. Lopez.",7,Southpark,17,3,,,,,,,,,
60920,Kyle,5,Out! ,7,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
60921,Cartman,5,Guys... Uh... Uh... ,7,Southpark,20,3,,,,,,,,,
60927,Kyle,5,Oh Jesus.,7,Southpark,9,2,,,,,,,,,
60940,Kyle,5,"Oh no, no, nonono.",7,Southpark,18,4,,,,,,,,,
60941,Kyle,5,Stop. It.,7,Southpark,9,2,,,,,,,,,
60943,Kyle,5,"Dude, who the hell is Mitch Connor?",7,Southpark,35,7,,,,,,,,,
60944,Cartman,5,"I don't know, Kyle, all right? Look, I don't care what you guys believe. But with all the crazy stuff that goes on in this town, isn't it possible, just possible, that something I don't understand happened here?",7,Southpark,211,38,,,,,,,,,
60945,Kyle,5,"All right.  All right, I guess it's possible.",7,Southpark,45,8,,,,,,,,,
60946,Cartman,5,Hahahahahaaaha!  I got you kinda! I got you kinda!,7,Southpark,50,9,,,,,,,,,
60955,Cartman,6,"Hello, sir. South Park Junior Detectives. We're wondering if you have any crimes to be solved, for a dollar.",7,Southpark,108,19,,,,,,,,,
60957,Kyle,6,"Awww, shit!",7,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
60958,Stan,6,"All right, sir, well, please call us if you need anything. ",7,Southpark,59,11,,,,,,,,,
60960,Cartman,6,Stupid assholes!  How come nobody has a crime to solve?,7,Southpark,55,10,,,,,,,,,
60961,Kyle,6,"Yeah, maybe starting a detective club isn't such a bright idea.",7,Southpark,63,11,,,,,,,,,
60962,Stan,6,"It's a great idea, we just have to keep working at it. ",7,Southpark,55,12,,,,,,,,,
60964,Stan,6,"Hello, ma'am, we're detectives with the South Park Crime Unit. Do you have any crimes you need to be solved, for a dollar?",7,Southpark,122,23,,,,,,,,,
60966,Kyle,6,Really?,7,Southpark,7,1,,,,,,,,,
60968,Cartman,6,My God...,7,Southpark,9,2,,,,,,,,,
60969,Stan,6,Have you reported this to any other authorities?,7,Southpark,48,8,,,,,,,,,
60971,Kyle,6,"Cool! We'll see what we can find, ma'am.",7,Southpark,40,8,,,,,,,,,
60972,Stan,6,We're on the case.,7,Southpark,18,4,,,,,,,,,
60973,Cartman,6,"What have you got, Marsh?",7,Southpark,25,5,,,,,,,,,
60974,Stan,6,Detective McCormick found something interesting. ,7,Southpark,49,5,,,,,,,,,
60975,Cartman,6,"Jesus, we're too late.",7,Southpark,22,4,,,,,,,,,
60976,Kyle,6,I think we can piece this case together now.,7,Southpark,44,9,,,,,,,,,
60978,Kyle,6,"Well, we've all talked it through and we've come up with a theory.",7,Southpark,66,13,,,,,,,,,
60980,Stan,6,"You said you set the pie in the window sill, where it must have sat for some time.  But its sweet smell attracted the attention of somebody. ",7,Southpark,141,27,,,,,,,,,
60981,Kyle,6,"Your husband.  He wanted that pie badly, but he knew that he was not allowed to eat it yet.",7,Southpark,91,19,,,,,,,,,
60982,Cartman,6,"Slowly the rage built inside his mind.  ""Why won't she let me eat that pie? Why does she always stop me from doing what I wanna do?!"" His only solution became obvious: Kill her!",7,Southpark,177,34,,,,,,,,,
60983,Stan,6,His plan was to use a hammer.,7,Southpark,29,7,,,,,,,,,
60984,Cartman,6,"Bash, bash, BASH your skull in, causing instant death. ",7,Southpark,55,9,,,,,,,,,
60985,Stan,6,"Then to make it impossible for police to identify the body, he'd use a shovel to remove your head. ",7,Southpark,99,19,,,,,,,,,
60986,Kyle,6,Then saw off the arms and legs. ,7,Southpark,32,7,,,,,,,,,
60987,Cartman,6,The torso he would dump into the lake. ,7,Southpark,39,8,,,,,,,,,
60988,Stan,6,The arms and legs he would dissolve with acid and lye in the bathtub. ,7,Southpark,70,14,,,,,,,,,
60989,Cartman,6,"And then, finally, he'd be able to eat that pie.",7,Southpark,48,10,,,,,,,,,
60990,Kyle,6,"But before he could go through with this entire plan, he discovered that the pie had already been eaten...  ...by your dog. ",7,Southpark,124,22,,,,,,,,,
60991,Cartman,6,"Looks like the game is over, old man! ",7,Southpark,38,8,,,,,,,,,
60993,Stan,6,Just the news.,7,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,
60995,Stan,6,"Hey, you owe us a dollar, lady.",7,Southpark,31,7,,,,,,,,,
60997,Stan,6,"Wow, look, you guys! Our first dollar! ",7,Southpark,39,7,,,,,,,,,
60998,Kyle,6,We're in business!,7,Southpark,18,3,,,,,,,,,
60999,Cartman,6,"Kenny, you got the f-a-g on that perp in Washington",7,Southpark,51,10,,,,,,,,,
61003,Stan,6,Yes it is!,7,Southpark,10,3,,,,,,,,,
61005,Cartman,6,"Thank you, Ms. Secretary, that will be all.  And get some more cookies and coffee! We're not paying you to sit on your ass!",7,Southpark,123,24,,,,,,,,,
61006,Kyle,6,Do you kow where your doll is?,7,Southpark,30,7,,,,,,,,,
61008,Stan,6,"All right, Sarah, come over here.  Now, I want you to describe what the doll looks like to our sketch artist, Kenny.",7,Southpark,116,22,,,,,,,,,
61010,Stan,6,"You got it, Ken? ",7,Southpark,17,4,,,,,,,,,
61011,Kyle,6,"All right, let's see.  Dammit Kenny, that's not what she said!",7,Southpark,62,11,,,,,,,,,
61012,Stan,6,"Put that away, dude! ",7,Southpark,21,4,,,,,,,,,
61013,Cartman,6,"Don't worry, ma'am. We'll find your doll.",7,Southpark,41,7,,,,,,,,,
61014,Cartman,6,No sign of forced entry.,7,Southpark,24,5,,,,,,,,,
61015,Kyle,6,But the window isn't locked.,7,Southpark,28,5,,,,,,,,,
61016,Stan,6,"Right, so it's possible that the thief sat out in that tree.  He would have watched Sarah with the doll, possibly while cutting the palms of his hands with a large knife.  The pain gave him sick pleasure.",7,Southpark,204,38,,,,,,,,,
61017,Kyle,6,Disposing of the doll wouldn't be easy. He would have had to have brought a shovel to decapitate it.,7,Southpark,100,19,,,,,,,,,
61018,Cartman,6,We're going to need semen samples from everything in this room. ,7,Southpark,64,11,,,,,,,,,
61020,Stan,6,"Hey, kid, what are you doing?",7,Southpark,29,6,,,,,,,,,
61022,Stan,6,Detective Marsh. I'm in charge of this investigation!,7,Southpark,53,8,,,,,,,,,

61026,Stan,6,Aw crap!,7,Southpark,8,2,,,,,,,,,
61028,Kyle,6,"Dude, we've been working this case since two-thirty!",7,Southpark,52,8,,,,,,,,,
61030,Stan,6,Son of a bitch stupid FBI!,7,Southpark,26,6,,,,,,,,,
61031,Cartman,6,"Well, I guess we can go back to playing laundromat.",7,Southpark,51,10,,,,,,,,,
61032,Stan,6,No! We're not gonna stop playing detectives! We've just gotta find that doll before thos FBI guys do.,7,Southpark,101,18,,,,,,,,,
61033,Kenny,6,,7,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
61034,Kyle,6,"Yeah, but how?",7,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,
61035,Stan,6,We're gonna have to just start bringing in people for questioning.,7,Southpark,66,11,,,,,,,,,
61036,Cartman,6,Right. I think I know exactly where to start.,7,Southpark,45,9,,,,,,,,,
61037,Cartman,6,"Where were you this morning at nine o'clock, Butters?!",7,Southpark,54,9,,,,,,,,,
61038,Butters,6,"Ah, I was at home.",7,Southpark,18,5,,,,,,,,,
61039,Cartman,6,Your story is full of holes and I'm gonna beat your ass if you don't start tellin' the truth! ,7,Southpark,94,19,,,,,,,,,

61043,Kenny,6,,7,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
61044,Cartman,6,You're a worthless two-dollar criminal and you're lying!,7,Southpark,56,8,,,,,,,,,
61045,Kenny,6,,7,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
61046,Butters,6,Well I don't have nothin' to confess. Honestly.,7,Southpark,47,8,,,,,,,,,
61047,Cartman,6,Fine! Then you won't mind giving us a semen sample. ,7,Southpark,52,10,,,,,,,,,
61048,Butters,6,How do I do that?,7,Southpark,17,5,,,,,,,,,
61049,Cartman,6,You just make the semen come out of your body and put it in this cup!,7,Southpark,69,16,,,,,,,,,
61050,Butters,6,Well how do I make semen... come out of my body?,7,Southpark,48,11,,,,,,,,,

61055,Cartman,6,I don't know. I was hoping you guys did.,7,Southpark,40,9,,,,,,,,,
61056,Stan,6,It's that thing we learned about in school where you pull on your wiener until white stuff comes out.,7,Southpark,101,19,,,,,,,,,
61057,Cartman,6,Really?,7,Southpark,7,1,,,,,,,,,
61058,Kyle,6,"Ohh, right, you're supposed to pull and master-benate your wiener really fast.",7,Southpark,78,12,,,,,,,,,
61059,Cartman,6,"Oh okay.  Okay, retard, you really don't know how to make semen come out?!",7,Southpark,74,14,,,,,,,,,
61060,Butters,6,No!,7,Southpark,3,1,,,,,,,,,

61062,Kenny,6, ,7,Southpark,1,0,,,,,,,,,
61063,Cartman,6,"Now, go sit on the toilet and pull and tug on your wiener until white stuff comes out, and then put it in this cup.",7,Southpark,115,25,,,,,,,,,

61095,Cartman,6,Why not?,7,Southpark,8,2,,,,,,,,,

61182,Kyle,6,We were happy playing Laundromat Owners.,7,Southpark,40,6,,,,,,,,,
61183,Stan,6,"I wasn't. We started playing Detective because we wanted our play time to mean something. Or have you forgotten why you joined the force, Kyle?",7,Southpark,143,25,,,,,,,,,

61447,Stan,7,"Just because you have a piece of paper saying you own it doesn't make it yours. We grew up here. Our parents grew up here. We shop at that Wal-Mart, and eat at that Chili's. We take fish from the streams and bread them and freeze them to make fish sticks. This is not just a town, it is our way of life.",7,Southpark,303,63,,,,,,,,,

61664,Cartman,8,"We have no choice, you guys. We're just gonna have to kill Kyle.",7,Southpark,64,13,,,,,,,,,
61665,Stan,8,What?? That's stupid. We wouldn't have to kill Kyle! We would just to tell him not to hang around us anymore.,7,Southpark,109,21,,,,,,,,,

61700,Chef,8,"Well, what do you want me to do about it?",7,Southpark,41,10,,,,,,,,,
61701,Mr. Garrison,8,"Chef, what did you do when white people stole your culture?",7,Southpark,59,11,,,,,,,,,
61702,Chef,8,"Oh. Well, we black people just always tried to stay out in front of them.",7,Southpark,73,15,,,,,,,,,
61704,Chef,8,"Well, like with our slang. Black people always used to say, ""I'm in the house"" instead of ""I'm here."" But then white people all started to say ""in the house"" so we switched it to ""in the hizzouse."" Hizzouse became hizzizzouse, and then white folk started saying that, and we had to change it to hizzie, then ""in the hizzle"" which we had to change to ""hizzle fo shizzle,"" and now, because white people say ""hizzle fo shizzle,"" we have to say ""flippity floppity floop.""",7,Southpark,467,85,,,,,,,,,
61705,Mr. Garrison,8,"We don't have time for all that, Chef! Oh, if only those Queer Eye For the Straight Guy people understood what they were doing.  Wait.  That's it! I know exactly what to do!  Come on, Mr. Slave! Let's get back to our flippity floppity floop. ",7,Southpark,242,45,,,,,,,,,

61754,Randy,8,"Yeah, Stanley. What are you fighting about?",7,Southpark,43,7,,,,,,,,,
61755,Stan,8,"Dad, Craig is trying to say that his dad can out dress you!",7,Southpark,59,13,,,,,,,,,

61761,Randy,8,"Please, girlfriend. You look like some kind of Little Orphan Annie nightmare.",7,Southpark,77,12,,,,,,,,,
61766,Randy,8,"Well, you know what I think? I think you're all metrophobic!",7,Southpark,60,11,,,,,,,,,
61771,Randy,8,"Crazy? Different? Outcasts? Call us what you want. But us metros are real people, just like you!",7,Southpark,96,17,,,,,,,,,

61786,Mr. Garrison,8,"But don't you see the price? You're selling out your own kind. Look, us gays have created a lifestyle, a, a culture that is uniquely ours. If we keep trying to make straight people into us, well, we're gonna have no identity left.",7,Southpark,230,43,,,,,,,,,

61868,Cartman,9,Heheheheheh heheheheheh.,7,Southpark,24,2,,,,,,,,,
61869,Kyle,9,"He's right, dude. We have to define our style if we're ever going to make a platinum album. I mean, ah I'm a fusion guy, but Kenny's background is more Latin Jazz.",7,Southpark,163,32,,,,,,,,,
61870,Kenny,9,,7,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
61871,Stan,9,"Yeah, and I'm more hip-hop and R-and-B oriented. ",7,Southpark,49,8,,,,,,,,,
61872,Kyle,9,I think out band better buy a whole bunch of music CDs to listen to for inspiration.,7,Southpark,84,17,,,,,,,,,
61873,Cartman,9,"Inspiration. Wait a minute,  that's it. Inspiration, you guys. Don't you see?",7,Southpark,77,12,,,,,,,,,
61874,Stan,9,See what?,7,Southpark,9,2,,,,,,,,,
61876,Kyle,9,Christian rock?!,7,Southpark,16,2,,,,,,,,,
61877,Cartman,9,"Think about it! It's the easiest crappiest music in the world, right? If we just play songs about how much we love Jesus, all the Christians will buy our crap!",7,Southpark,159,30,,,,,,,,,
61878,Kyle,9,"That's a retarded idea, Cartman!",7,Southpark,32,5,,,,,,,,,

61902,Butters,9,Awww.,7,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
61904,Cartman,9,"Wait!  Walk out that door, Token, and you'll regret it the rest of your life! Christians have a built-in audience of over one hundred and eighty million Americans!

61905,Butters,9,"Two billion, three hundred and thirty one million dollars.",7,Southpark,58,9,,,,,,,,,

61907,Kyle,9,"Dad, can I borrow three hundred dollars?",7,Southpark,40,7,,,,,,,,,
61909,Kyle,9,Our band can't find a stylistic direction to go in. We need to go down to the mall to buy hundreds of CDs to listen to so we can define our sound.,7,Southpark,146,32,,,,,,,,,
61911,Kyle,9,Ugh. Can't you see this is my dream?? Music is my life!,7,Southpark,55,12,,,,,,,,,

61938,Kyle,9,I don't know!,7,Southpark,13,3,,,,,,,,,
61939,Cartman,9,"All right, guys, this is gonna be so easy. All we have to do to make Christian songs is take regular old songs and add Jesus stuff to them.  See? All we have to do is cross out words like ""baby"" and ""Darling"" and replace them with  Jesus. All right, Butters, give me a beat.  Okay, nice. Very nice. All right, Token, give me a smooth bass line.",7,Southpark,344,68,,,,,,,,,

61961,Butters,9,Ow...,7,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,

61984,Kenny,9,,7,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
61985,Kyle,9,"No! Didn't you guys learn anything? Look, if we make an album, all that's gonna happen is that people are gonna steal our songs for free off the Internet. We won't make a dime!",7,Southpark,176,34,,,,,,,,,

61996,Cartman,9,"It's just a matter of time, my friends. This weekend is Christfest. The single largest gathering of Christians in the Midwest. Each one of them a walking, praying wallet full of cash. And I'll be there selling my album.",7,Southpark,219,39,,,,,,,,,
61997,Kyle,9,"You'll never get a platinum album doing Christian rock, Cartman! It was a stupid idea then, and it's a stupid idea now!",7,Southpark,119,22,,,,,,,,,
61998,Stan,9,"Yeah, you don't even know anything about Christianity.",7,Southpark,54,8,,,,,,,,,
61999,Cartman,9,"I know enough to exploit it. Just get that ten bucks ready, Kyle. Ta-ta! ",7,Southpark,73,14,,,,,,,,,
62000,Kyle,9,Go ahead! People will just download your songs for free on the Internet anyways!,7,Southpark,80,14,,,,,,,,,
62001,Stan,9,What a dumbass. Our band is way cooler than his.,7,Southpark,48,10,,,,,,,,,
62002,Kenny,9,,7,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
62005,Cartman,9,"Yes, it's really the best Christian album that's ever been produced, actually..",7,Southpark,79,12,,,,,,,,,
62007,Cartman,9,"I think that's what the whole world needs, praise Christ.",7,Southpark,57,10,,,,,,,,,
62008,Butters,9,"Huh we're not really Christians, we're just pretendin' we are. ",7,Southpark,63,10,,,,,,,,,
62009,Cartman,9,"Butters, remind me later to cut your balls off.",7,Southpark,47,9,,,,,,,,,
62014,Cartman,9,"Dammit! If we're gonna sell our hot Christian album, we have got to get on that stage! ",7,Southpark,87,17,,,,,,,,,
62016,Cartman,9,Who are you?,7,Southpark,12,3,,,,,,,,,
62019,Cartman,9,"Yeah, you guys are real hard core.",7,Southpark,34,7,,,,,,,,,
62024,Cartman,9,"Eh hey guys, wait, uh, ..we wannaaa play with you before you go onstage.",7,Southpark,72,14,,,,,,,,,
62027,Cartman,9,"Let's just go over here so we can hear ourselves better.  Lord, Father in Heaven, we thank you for all your blessings and we... ",7,Southpark,128,24,,,,,,,,,
62028,Butters,9,"Hey, Eric, I don't think they can get out. ",7,Southpark,43,9,,,,,,,,,
62034,Cartman,9,"You know, Jesus? I've been thinking a lot about you lately and, well, that's why I wrote this song.I love you, Jesus. I want you to walk with meI'll take good care of you baby. Call you my baby, baby!You died for my sins, and you know that I would die for you, right?What's the matter, baby? You tremble at Jesus, baby!Your love... is my life! You know when I_—Èm without you, there's a black hole in my life! Oo-ohhh!I wanna believe. It's all right, 'cause I get lonely in the night and it's up to you toSave me! Jee...sus...bay-by!",7,Southpark,533,100,,,,,,,,,
62035,Stan,9,"Dude, I didn't know being in a band was gonna be this tough.",7,Southpark,60,13,,,,,,,,,
62036,Kyle,9,"Yeah, it's tough. But it's times like these that... you see what your band is made of. We've gotta fight through the rough times like Journey!",7,Southpark,142,26,,,,,,,,,
62039,Stan,9,"Hey, it's that Lars Ulrich guy!",7,Southpark,31,6,,,,,,,,,
62044,Cartman,9,Thank you so much. Christ has really blessed us with talent.,7,Southpark,60,11,,,,,,,,,
62045,Butters,9,Heeheeheeyeah.,7,Southpark,14,1,,,,,,,,,
62047,Cartman,9,"Yes, we sure do.",7,Southpark,16,4,,,,,,,,,
62049,Cartman,9,"Well what are you saying? That, that you don't really love Christ??",7,Southpark,67,12,,,,,,,,,
62051,Cartman,9,"Well what's the difference?! You love Christ, you're in love with Christ, I mean, uh, what the heck is this??",7,Southpark,109,20,,,,,,,,,
62053,Cartman,9,"I resent that, sir! I have never in my life done anything just for the money! If I'm lying may the Lord strike me down right now.",7,Southpark,129,27,,,,,,,,,
62054,Butters,9,"Uhm, oh. ",7,Southpark,9,2,,,,,,,,,
62057,Cartman,9,Oh Lord you are my Savior! You know I miss you so much when you are gone.,7,Southpark,73,17,,,,,,,,,
62059,Cartman,9,"Yes I may be born again, but I was wasn't born again yesterday.I wanna get down on my knees and start pleasing Jesus! I wanna feel his salvation all over my face!",7,Southpark,162,32,,,,,,,,,
62061,Cartman,9,"The Body of Christ! Sleek swimmer's body, all muscled up and toned!The Body of Christ! O, Lord Almighty, I wish I could call it my own!You're one time, two times, three times my Savior...Whenever I see Jesus up on that Cross I can't help but think that he looks kinda hot...",7,Southpark,274,51,,,,,,,,,
62063,Stan,9,"I can't take this much longer. Maybe we're just, not cut out to be in a band.",7,Southpark,77,17,,,,,,,,,
62064,Kyle,9,"You guys, we can't give up on our dreams now! As soon as this strike ends, we're gonna be the biggest band ever!",7,Southpark,112,23,,,,,,,,,
62066,Kyle,9,I'm sure we're gonna get word any minute that people have agreed to stop. ,7,Southpark,74,14,,,,,,,,,
62068,Kyle,9,"That's us!  ""Dear MOOP. This letter is to inform you that Faith Plus One's debut album has just sold one million copies.""",7,Southpark,121,22,,,,,,,,,
62069,Stan,9,What??,7,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
62070,Kyle,9,"""We cordially invite you to attend the platinum album award ceremony, which will be held tomorrow morning at ten. Details and proof of sales enclosed. P.S. Nananana na na. Hahahaha ha ha.""  He did it. Cartman got a platinum album.",7,Southpark,230,40,,,,,,,,,
62071,Stan,9,Is this for real?? This is for real!,7,Southpark,36,8,,,,,,,,,
62072,Kyle,9,He beat us. Because all this time we've been so caught up with how to protect our music that we forgot to just play.,7,Southpark,116,24,,,,,,,,,
62074,Kyle,9,"Because that's what real artists do. People are always gonna find a way to copy our music and swap it for free. If we're real musicians, then we should just play and be stoked that so many people are listening.",7,Southpark,210,40,,,,,,,,,
62075,Stan,9,"Beside, maybe our sound would have gotten downloaded for free, but if they were good songs then people still would have bought tickets to see our band in concert. ",7,Southpark,163,29,,,,,,,,,
62076,Kyle,9,"From now on, MOOP isn't about money. MOOP is about music! We're not striking anymore! Who's with us?! ",7,Southpark,102,18,,,,,,,,,
62079,Kyle,9,Oh.,7,Southpark,3,1,,,,,,,,,
62080,Stan,9,"So... Dude, what are you gonna do about your bet with Cartman. Are you- gonna pay 'im?",7,Southpark,86,17,,,,,,,,,
62081,Kyle,9,"I don't have a choice, dude. I'm gonna swallow my pride, face Cartman, and say ""Congratulations. You were right"" And I'm gonna give him the ten dollars. And hopefully, he won't make a big deal out of it.",7,Southpark,203,38,,,,,,,,,
62082,Cartman,9,Welcome! Welcome everyone! Please enjoy! The presentation should begin shortly.,7,Southpark,79,10,,,,,,,,,
62084,Cartman,9,Our platinum album ceremony. I spared no expense.,7,Southpark,49,8,,,,,,,,,
62086,Cartman,9,"We're Faith Plus One, Token, there'll be plenty more money. Relax and enjoy, black asshole.  There's hors d'oeuvres and drinks by the Ferris wheel, everyone!  Oh Kyle, guys, so nice to see you!",7,Southpark,193,33,,,,,,,,,
62087,Kyle,9,"Let's just get this over with, Cartman. You won the bet, here's ten dollars.",7,Southpark,76,14,,,,,,,,,
62088,Cartman,9,"Oh nonononono, not yet, Kyle. Hold on.  Everyone! Everyone, can I have your attention please? ",7,Southpark,94,15,,,,,,,,,
62090,Cartman,9,"Yes, yes, thank you thank you. Praise Him. I think we're ready to start now. ",7,Southpark,77,15,,,,,,,,,
62092,Kyle,9,This is the worst day of my life.,7,Southpark,33,8,,,,,,,,,
62093,Cartman,9,"Ahhh, this is the best day of my life. ",7,Southpark,39,9,,,,,,,,,
62095,Cartman,9,Thank you very uh- wah? Myrrh album?,7,Southpark,36,7,,,,,,,,,
62096,Stan,9,I thought albums win either gold or platinum.,7,Southpark,45,8,,,,,,,,,
62098,Kyle,9,"Ha! Our bet was that you would get a platinum album, not a myrrh album! I don't owe you anything, fat boy!",7,Southpark,106,22,,,,,,,,,
62099,Cartman,9,You mean to tell me I could never get a platinum album with a Christian rock band?!,7,Southpark,83,17,,,,,,,,,
62101,Cartman,9,GOD DAMMIT!! ,7,Southpark,13,2,,,,,,,,,
62103,Cartman,9,Who cares?! I can never win my bet because you stupid assholes don't give out platinum albums!,7,Southpark,94,17,,,,,,,,,
62105,Cartman,9,"OH, FUCK JESUS!! ",7,Southpark,17,3,,,,,,,,,
62106,Butters,9,"Eric, I-I'm pretty sure you shouldn't say the F-word about-uh Jesus.",7,Southpark,68,11,,,,,,,,,
62108,Cartman,9,"Who fuckin' cares, Token?! I could never beat Kyle now! I'll say it again! Fuck Jesus! ",7,Southpark,87,16,,,,,,,,,
62111,Cartman,9,"Ah, fuck you, Token! You black asshole! ",7,Southpark,40,7,,,,,,,,,
62112,Stan,9,Hm. Guess he got what he deserved. ,7,Southpark,35,7,,,,,,,,,
62113,Butters,9,"Fuck you, Eric. ",7,Southpark,16,3,,,,,,,,,
62115,Cartman,10,"Oh God, memorial services are sooo boring.",7,Southpark,42,7,,,,,,,,,
62116,Kyle,10,"You insensitive asshole, Cartman! Nine people died!",7,Southpark,51,7,,,,,,,,,
62117,Cartman,10,"Yeah, but like, eight of them were hippies. Mostly hippies go to farmer's markets. Mostly.",7,Southpark,90,15,,,,,,,,,
62119,Mr. Garrison,10,Look out!! ,7,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
62121,Stan,10,"Hey Dad, how come they let old people drive?",7,Southpark,44,9,,,,,,,,,
62122,Randy,10,"Well, Stan, it's a very fragile issue.",7,Southpark,38,7,,,,,,,,,
62123,Stan,10,But they kill people.,7,Southpark,21,4,,,,,,,,,
62124,Randy,10,"Sometimes, yes, but senior citizens have to be dealt with very gingerly, Stan. We can't just take their licenses away.",7,Southpark,118,20,,,,,,,,,
62128,Randy,10,Yes Dad.,7,Southpark,8,2,,,,,,,,,
62130,Randy,10,Yes I know.,7,Southpark,11,3,,,,,,,,,
62132,Stan,10,"I think old people should have rights, Grandpa. I just don't wanna die.",7,Southpark,71,13,,,,,,,,,
62165,Randy,10,"Sharon, have you seen Dad?",7,Southpark,26,5,,,,,,,,,
62167,Randy,10,"Oh.  Wait a minute. If all the seniors in town are at a meeting, that means that when the meeting gets out...",7,Southpark,109,22,,,,,,,,,
62169,Randy,10,At the same time.  Oh My God!,7,Southpark,29,7,,,,,,,,,
62170,Randy,10,Get inside! Get inside!  Seniors' meeting getting out! Get off the streets! ,7,Southpark,76,12,,,,,,,,,
62175,Randy,10,Get off the streets! Get off the streets! Old people are driving!  Gerald! Where are the boys?!,7,Southpark,95,17,,,,,,,,,
62177,Randy,10,"The boys, Gerald! Where are they?!",7,Southpark,34,6,,,,,,,,,
62179,Randy,10,Oh My God!! ,7,Southpark,12,3,,,,,,,,,
62180,Cartman,10,"With just ten seconds to go, the offense makes its move. Marsh heads for the goal and passes the ball to the poor kid. The poor kid hands it out to the Jew! The Jew shoots. Awww, and the shot is blocked again , proving once and for all that Jews cannot play hockey!",7,Southpark,265,54,,,,,,,,,
62181,Kyle,10,It isn't fair. Cartman's fatter than the goal.,7,Southpark,46,8,,,,,,,,,
62182,Cartman,10,I'm not fat. I just have a sweet hockey body.,7,Southpark,45,10,,,,,,,,,
62183,Randy,10,GET OFF THE STREETS!  GET OFF THE STREETS! ,7,Southpark,43,8,,,,,,,,,
62184,Kyle,10,"Dude, look!",7,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
62185,Randy,10,GET OFF... THE STREETS! GET OFF THE STREETS!,7,Southpark,44,8,,,,,,,,,
62186,Stan,10,What is that?,7,Southpark,13,3,,,,,,,,,
62187,Kyle,10,I don't know.,7,Southpark,13,3,,,,,,,,,
62188,Randy,10,GET OFF... GET STRAIGHT OFF THE STREET!,7,Southpark,39,7,,,,,,,,,
62189,Kyle,10,"Dude, is that your dad?",7,Southpark,23,5,,,,,,,,,
62190,Stan,10,I think so.,7,Southpark,11,3,,,,,,,,,
62191,Cartman,10,Looks like Stan's dad's been hittin' the bottle again.,7,Southpark,54,9,,,,,,,,,
62192,Stan,10,What is he saying?,7,Southpark,18,4,,,,,,,,,
62193,Kyle,10,I can't understand him.,7,Southpark,23,4,,,,,,,,,
62194,Randy,10,GAAAAAH!!,7,Southpark,9,1,,,,,,,,,
62195,Cartman,10,Calm down! We cannot understand you!,7,Southpark,36,6,,,,,,,,,
62196,Kenny,10,  ,7,Southpark,2,0,,,,,,,,,
62197,Stan,10,Oh Jesus!,7,Southpark,9,2,,,,,,,,,
62198,Cartman,10,Old people!,7,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
62199,Randy,10,Come on! ,7,Southpark,9,2,,,,,,,,,
62200,Cartman,10,"Oh God, they're coming! ",7,Southpark,24,4,,,,,,,,,
62201,Randy,10,Get over there! Stay low! ,7,Southpark,26,5,,,,,,,,,
62202,Kyle,10,Why are they all out driving at the same time?,7,Southpark,46,10,,,,,,,,,
62203,Randy,10,"Shhhh!  It's okay, boys. They're gone. Let's just lay low for a minute until we can find-  AWWWW!!",7,Southpark,98,18,,,,,,,,,
62205,Randy,10,RUN! ,7,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
62207,Randy,10,Get up the stairs! Up the stairs! Come on! Come on!! ,7,Southpark,53,11,,,,,,,,,
62208,Kyle,10,Aah! There's another one!,7,Southpark,25,4,,,,,,,,,
62211,Randy,10,In here! ,7,Southpark,9,2,,,,,,,,,
62212,Cartman,10,They're not gonna stop until we're all dead!,7,Southpark,44,8,,,,,,,,,
62213,Randy,10,Quiet! Keep quiet! ,7,Southpark,19,3,,,,,,,,,
62214,Stan,10,"Dad, I'm scared.",7,Southpark,16,3,,,,,,,,,
62215,Randy,10,"Just, keep your voices down. We'll stay the night in here. We'll stay the whole winter if we have to. ",7,Southpark,102,20,,,,,,,,,
62216,Stan,10,I'm not staying the winter in this room! We just need to tell old people they can't drive anymore!,7,Southpark,98,19,,,,,,,,,
62217,Randy,10,"Awgh. Stan, it's not that simple! Just relax while I find the lights. Here we go. ",7,Southpark,82,16,,,,,,,,,
62233,Cartman,10,"Ooooh, isn't this great you guys? Being able to walk the streets now that old people are confined to their homes where they belong?",7,Southpark,131,24,,,,,,,,,
62235,Stan,10,"Uh, Grandpa, I don't think you should be driving.",7,Southpark,49,9,,,,,,,,,
62237,Kyle,10,"Well, look at it this way: statistically speaking, we're safer inside a car with an old person driving than outside.",7,Southpark,116,20,,,,,,,,,
62238,Cartman,10,"My God, he's right.  Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee, even though I walk through the valley of death.  Guys, I don't know if I ever told you this, but, well, I love you guys.  Except for you, Kyle.",7,Southpark,213,43,,,,,,,,,
62240,Kenny,10, ,7,Southpark,1,0,,,,,,,,,
62241,Stan,10,"Ah, I think there's a police car behind you, Grandpa.",7,Southpark,53,10,,,,,,,,,
62244,Cartman,10,I believe that's us... thank God. ,7,Southpark,34,6,,,,,,,,,
62251,Randy,10,"Oh brother. Well, good job, dad! Look at you now!",7,Southpark,49,10,,,,,,,,,
62253,Randy,10,"You just had to be so damn stubborn, didn't you?!",7,Southpark,49,10,,,,,,,,,
62255,Randy,10,"We're not treating you like children, Dad. All right? Now I think you owe Mr. Police Officer an apology. Who needs to apologize, hm?  Who's the sorry-sorry?",7,Southpark,156,27,,,,,,,,,
62257,Randy,10,"Well fine. I was gonna bail you out, but maybe you can just sit here for a bit and think about what you did!",7,Southpark,108,24,,,,,,,,,
62259,Stan,10,What's that?,7,Southpark,12,2,,,,,,,,,
62261,Mr. Garrison,10,"And so you see, children, Genghis Khan was a ""Mongol,"" not to be confused with a ""mongoloid"" like the actor, Nicholas Cage. Okay now, who can tell me in what  ...year ...the ...first ...film by a... mongoloid...  That's odd.  Those ROTC guys are way off course. ",7,Southpark,262,46,,,,,,,,,
62262,Cartman,10,More old people!,7,Southpark,16,3,,,,,,,,,
62263,Stan,10,The American Association of Retired Persons.,7,Southpark,44,6,,,,,,,,,
62264,Mr. Garrison,10,"Stay in your seats, children. I'll be right back.",7,Southpark,49,9,,,,,,,,,
62269,Mr. Garrison,10,"Uh, can I help you folks find something?  Oowww! ",7,Southpark,49,9,,,,,,,,,
62270,Cartman,10,Old people gone mad!,7,Southpark,20,4,,,,,,,,,
62287,Randy,10,What the hell is going on?!,7,Southpark,27,6,,,,,,,,,
62292,Randy,10,"Dad, what are you doing??",7,Southpark,25,5,,,,,,,,,
62302,Randy,10,"This is insane, Dad! You all need to stop right now before more people get hurt!",7,Southpark,80,16,,,,,,,,,
62319,Stan,10,Hey Dad.,7,Southpark,8,2,,,,,,,,,
62320,Randy,10,Stan! Boys! You're safe!,7,Southpark,24,4,,,,,,,,,
62321,Stan,10,"Dad, why is everyone letting old people do this? Why doesn't somebody stop them?",7,Southpark,80,14,,,,,,,,,
62322,Randy,10,"They've tried to stop them, son, but... the seniors get up so early in the morning they... get everything done before everyone else is even awake!",7,Southpark,146,26,,,,,,,,,
62323,Kyle,10,They're saying something about taking over the entire country.,7,Southpark,62,9,,,,,,,,,
62324,Randy,10,"Yes. And now seeing how early they get up, I don't see how anyone can stop them. Wait a minute. You boys! You get up almost as early as they do! You can fight them!",7,Southpark,164,35,,,,,,,,,
62325,Stan,10,"No. Come on, Dad. Can't you guys do it?",7,Southpark,39,9,,,,,,,,,
62326,Randy,10,"No, son. We... like to sleep in.",7,Southpark,32,7,,,,,,,,,
62328,Randy,10,"They're coming!! Get out of here before they see you! Run to the hills and find a way to fight them! Go!!  Boys, avenger me! AVENGER ME!!",7,Southpark,137,27,,,,,,,,,
62329,Stan,10,"All right, check it out. Kenny did reconnaissance on the town. The old people have blockades here  and here . The old ladies are keeping watch in towers around the perimeter, and the leaders along with my grandpa are most likely in the Mayor's office.",7,Southpark,251,45,,,,,,,,,
62330,Cartman,10,So our only solution is to cut off their life force.,7,Southpark,52,11,,,,,,,,,
62331,Kyle,10,"We can't fight them, Cartman.",7,Southpark,29,5,,,,,,,,,
62332,Cartman,10,No. But we can sneak into town and shut down their food supply.  Here.,7,Southpark,70,14,,,,,,,,,
62333,Kyle,10,Country Kitchen Buffet?,7,Southpark,23,3,,,,,,,,,
62334,Cartman,10,"Yeah. You take out Country Kitchen Buffet, and old people won't know what to do.",7,Southpark,80,15,,,,,,,,,
62335,Kyle,10,"That's a retarded idea, Cartman!",7,Southpark,32,5,,,,,,,,,
62336,Cartman,10,Is it? Two years ago they closed the Country Kitchen Buffet in Steamboat Springs. And all the old people died of starvation in less than a week.,7,Southpark,144,27,,,,,,,,,
62337,Stan,10,"Yeah, I remember hearing about that.",7,Southpark,36,6,,,,,,,,,
62338,Kyle,10,"Ech, even if it could work, how would we go about shutting it down?",7,Southpark,67,14,,,,,,,,,
62339,Cartman,10,"I think I have a plan, though we'll have to do it tonight.  We'll start by sneaking into town, cleverly disguised as black people.  At 5:45 Kenny and Kyle split off and set a diversion on the east end of town.  Meanwhile, Stan and I sneak into the Mayor's office  and steal some of the explosives the old people have stashed. Nine o'clock: we rendezvous at the Country Kitchen Buffet, where we strap the explosives and the timer to Kyle's chest. We say our tearful goodbyes to Kyle, and then we send him inside. ",7,Southpark,512,94,,,,,,,,,
62340,Cartman,10,Yeah!,7,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
62341,Stan,10,All right!,7,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,
62342,Kenny,10,,7,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
62343,Cartman,10,Aw yeah!,7,Southpark,8,2,,,,,,,,,
62344,Stan,10,We did it! ,7,Southpark,11,3,,,,,,,,,
62345,Stan,10,"...Yeah, or we just go to Country Kitchen Buffet and lock it from the inside so the seniors can't get in.",7,Southpark,105,21,,,,,,,,,
62346,Cartman,10,"Well, right, or we could always do that.",7,Southpark,40,8,,,,,,,,,
62361,Randy,10,"Whoa-ho-ho-ooh, what happened? Is it over?",7,Southpark,42,6,,,,,,,,,
62366,Randy,10,"Well, I think he learned his lesson. Huh? Don't you feel silly now, Dad? I think somebody owes us all an apology. Yes he does.",7,Southpark,126,25,,,,,,,,,
62367,Stan,10,"Oh, stop it, Dad! This is partly your fault!",7,Southpark,44,9,,,,,,,,,
62368,Randy,10,Huh?,7,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
62369,Stan,10,"Look, all Grandpa wants is not to be talked to like a child. I think half of what he was angry about wasn't what you were doing, but how you were doing it.",7,Southpark,155,33,,,,,,,,,
62371,Stan,10,"And Grandpa, you should be proud that you made it through life to be a senior, but you should also realize that, when you're behind the wheel, you're a killing machine.",7,Southpark,168,31,,,,,,,,,
62373,Randy,10,"Well, I think this has been a real learning experience for the Marsh family. People died, but we all grew a bit. Let's just go home.",7,Southpark,132,26,,,,,,,,,
62375,Randy,10,That's our Grandpa. ,7,Southpark,20,3,,,,,,,,,
62376,Stan,10,"Dude, I hate my family. ",7,Southpark,24,5,,,,,,,,,

62441,Cartman,11,"So, fine, Kyle, but honestly, I never meant to make you feel like you didn't matter at all to me. I know we argue all the time and I give you tons of crap, but we've also been through a, a lot together, and... maybe that alone doesn't make us friends, but it makes us something.

62756,Randy,12,Who are the Harrisons?,7,Southpark,22,4,,,,,,,,,
62757,Stan,12,The new people that moved in down the street. Mr. Harrison said that Joseph Smith spoke to God and Jesus and they told him none of the religions were right.,7,Southpark,156,30,,,,,,,,,

62797,Randy,12,"Yeah. Yeah! You know, to be honist, I've never known any Mormons. I, don't even know what you people believe. Who was this Joseph Smith guy? Why did he believe that Native Americans are actually white people from Jerusalem?",7,Southpark,223,39,,,,,,,,,

62854,Cartman,12,"Eeheehee, Jesus Christ. ",7,Southpark,24,3,,,,,,,,,
62856,Stan,12,Yyeah. I had a question about that Joseph Smith guy.,7,Southpark,52,10,,,,,,,,,
62858,Stan,12,What happened after he found the golden plates buried in the ground?,7,Southpark,68,12,,,,,,,,,
62860,Stan,12,"Yeah, but... how?",7,Southpark,17,3,,,,,,,,,
62878,Randy,12,"One two three four. ""Pay one thousand dollars property tax.""  Isn't this great, you guys? Our first Family Home Evening.",7,Southpark,120,20,,,,,,,,,
62880,Randy,12,We're not watching TV! We're Mormons now and we're having Family Home Evening!,7,Southpark,78,13,,,,,,,,,
62881,Stan,12,"Dad, did you know that that Joseph Smith guy read the Book of Mormon out of a hat?",7,Southpark,82,18,,,,,,,,,
62882,Randy,12,"And?  Your turn, Sharon.",7,Southpark,24,4,,,,,,,,,
62883,Stan,12,"It's just that... the Book of Mormon says a lot of strange stuff, like that Adam and Eve lived in Jackson County, Missouri.",7,Southpark,123,23,,,,,,,,,
62884,Randy,12,Yes.,7,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
62885,Stan,12,But school taught me that the first man and woman lived in Africa.,7,Southpark,66,13,,,,,,,,,

62900,Stan,12,Yeah.,7,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
62921,Stan,12,...Wait. Mormons actually know this story and they still believe Joseph Smith was a prophet?,7,Southpark,92,15,,,,,,,,,
62923,Stan,12,"No, it proves he DID make it all up. Are you blind?",7,Southpark,51,12,,,,,,,,,
62925,Stan,12,"No, it's a matter of logic! If you're gonna say things that have been proven wrong, like that the first man and woman lived in Missouri, and that Native Americans came from Jerusalem, then you'd better have something to back it up. All you've got are a bunch of stories about some asswipe who read plates nobody ever saw out of a hat, and then couldn't do it again when the translatios were hidden!",7,Southpark,398,74,,,,,,,,,
62926,Randy,12,"Hey, Stan, don't denounce our religion.",7,Southpark,39,6,,,,,,,,,
62927,Stan,12,"I don't wanna be Mormon, Dad!",7,Southpark,29,6,,,,,,,,,
62932,Stan,12,"Oh, stop it!  That's another thing! Why do you have to be so freakin' nice all the time?! It isn't normal! You just weasel people into your way of thinking by acting like the happiest family in the world and being so nice to everyone that you just blindside dumb people like my Dad!",7,Southpark,282,54,,,,,,,,,
62933,Randy,12,Yeah! ,7,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
62936,Kyle,12,"Oh, hey Stan. Where's your best buddy, Gary?",7,Southpark,44,8,,,,,,,,,

63025,Kyle,13,"You guys, maybe we should come clean right now and tell everyone that it wasn't the tobacco companies that made us want to smoke.",7,Southpark,129,24,,,,,,,,,
63026,Stan,13,Hwat??,7,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
63027,Cartman,13,"Why? It's perfect. If everyone's blaming the tobacco companies, then nobody's blaming us.",7,Southpark,89,13,,,,,,,,,
63028,Stan,13,"Yeah, what's the problem?",7,Southpark,25,4,,,,,,,,,
63029,Kyle,13,"Well it's just that, eh, this seems like another one of those times when things are gonna get way out of hands, you know? It's been happening a lot lately. How about this time we just put a stop to it right now?",7,Southpark,211,43,,,,,,,,,
63030,Cartman,13,"Dumbass, you don't wanna be grounded for three weeks, do you?",7,Southpark,61,11,,,,,,,,,
63031,Stan,13,"Yeah, don't worry dude. Things aren't gonna get out of hand.",7,Southpark,60,11,,,,,,,,,
63032,Mr. Garrison,13,Here he comes! ,7,Southpark,15,3,,,,,,,,,
63034,Mr. Garrison,13,What'd he say?,7,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,
63036,Kyle,13,Oh no...,7,Southpark,8,2,,,,,,,,,
63038,Cartman,13,Got it! ,7,Southpark,8,2,,,,,,,,,
63039,Kyle,13,"But... isn't that, kind of, lying?",7,Southpark,34,6,,,,,,,,,
63051,Cartman,13,"Isn't he awesome, you guys?",7,Southpark,27,5,,,,,,,,,
63052,Kyle,13,What??,7,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
63053,Cartman,13,"Dude, he just goes around imposing his will on people. He's my idol. ",7,Southpark,69,13,,,,,,,,,
63055,Cartman,13,"Handle it? For two billion dollars I'd handle my grandpa's balls, sir.",7,Southpark,70,12,,,,,,,,,
63066,Kyle,13,"So, tobacco helped to build America.",7,Southpark,36,6,,,,,,,,,
63068,Cartman,13,"Which means, if it weren't for tobacco, many of our black friends wouldn't be here today.",7,Southpark,89,16,,,,,,,,,
63070,Kyle,13,That sound perfectly reasonable.,7,Southpark,32,4,,,,,,,,,
63082,Stan,13,Those people at the tobacco company all seem really nice.,7,Southpark,57,10,,,,,,,,,
63085,Cartman,13,"Wow. It's like, it's like, smoking brings a lot of people just a little bit of joy and, and you get to take that away from them.  You are so awesome.",7,Southpark,149,31,,,,,,,,,
63087,Kyle,13,"But dude, you're making stuff up.",7,Southpark,33,6,,,,,,,,,
63089,Cartman,13,"Oh my God, that is what I've always said.  I love this guy!",7,Southpark,59,13,,,,,,,,,
63094,Cartman,13,"Wow, a commercial?",7,Southpark,18,3,,,,,,,,,
63096,Cartman,13,"God, he's just the best!  Mr. Reiner, can I get you a muffin? O-or a cold drink, perhaps?",7,Southpark,89,18,,,,,,,,,
63097,Kyle,13,"Guys, I think we should bail out of this right now!",7,Southpark,51,11,,,,,,,,,
63098,Stan,13,Huh?,7,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
63099,Kyle,13,"This is just startin' to look like another one of those times where it-it's gonna end up with the whole town turning out, it's a big showdown happening, and us havin' to talk about what we learned, and I say we just stop right now, and go play cards or something.",7,Southpark,263,51,,,,,,,,,
63100,Kenny,13,,7,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
63101,Stan,13,"Yeah, maybe you're right. ",7,Southpark,26,4,,,,,,,,,
63102,Cartman,13,"So, heh gentlemen, looks like only one of us gets to be in the commercial, huh? Who will it be...? Gentlemen, the game is on!",7,Southpark,125,25,,,,,,,,,
63103,Kyle,13,Go ahead. We don't wanna be in their stupid commercial.,7,Southpark,55,10,,,,,,,,,
63104,Cartman,13,"Huh? Oh, I get it, Kyle. That's your Serbian Jew double bluff. Make me think you don't care about being in the commercial so that maybe I won't either. Ooops. didn't work, did it, Kyle?",7,Southpark,185,35,,,,,,,,,
63105,Kyle,13,"No, we really want nothing more to do with these people.",7,Southpark,56,11,,,,,,,,,
63106,Cartman,13,"Sure you don't, Kyle. Oh, and neither do I. Oh, I know what you're gonna say next. You're gonna say, ""How about none of us show up tomorrow to do it?"" And then I'm supposed to agree so that tomorrow you can waltz in all by yourself and do the commercial. That's Serbian Jew double bluff and it ain't  gonna  work  on  me  ha  ha  ha . Only one of us can be in the commercial, gentlemen. The game... is on. ",7,Southpark,406,81,,,,,,,,,
63107,Cartman,13,"Sorry Kyle, but I'm afraid only one of us will be showing up to do the commercial tomorrow! Hahahaha! Thought you had me with your Serbian Jew double bluff, didn't you?! Well let's see you try to open this door now.  Hahahahaha! Haa haa hahahahahaha! Haa haa haha- ",7,Southpark,265,48,,,,,,,,,
63108,Kyle,13,What are you doing? ,7,Southpark,20,4,,,,,,,,,
63109,Cartman,13,"Oh... Hello, Kyle. Oh man.  Wait, this isn't my house.",7,Southpark,54,10,,,,,,,,,
63110,Kyle,13,"Cartman, you go ahead and do the commercial tomorrow. But I'm warning you, those anti-smoking people are liars and they're bullies who will stop at nothing to get what they want, and that means they're dangerous. ",7,Southpark,213,36,,,,,,,,,
63111,Cartman,13,"Hahahahahaha!  Nice try, Kyle! Let's see you try to get through the door now! Haa haa hahahahaha!",7,Southpark,97,17,,,,,,,,,
63113,Cartman,13,"Heh, ho-okay. ",7,Southpark,14,2,,,,,,,,,
63115,Cartman,13,"Heh, okay, okay.  You know, some people say there's no proof that second-hand smoke kills. The tobacco companies say there's no proof that second-hand smoke kills. I've just been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. I guess... I'm the proof. The next time you want to believe that second-hand smoke doesn't kill, think about me. Because, by the time you see this commercial, I'll be... dead.  Dead??",7,Southpark,399,66,,,,,,,,,
63117,Cartman,13,"Uh what... what does that mean, ""I'll be dead""? Hey, uh what, what was that ""dead"" part?",7,Southpark,88,17,,,,,,,,,
63119,Cartman,13,"Uh, nnno, thanks. I'm not hungry.",7,Southpark,33,6,,,,,,,,,
63121,Cartman,13,I'm not eating the cupcake.,7,Southpark,27,5,,,,,,,,,
63123,Cartman,13,Jesus Christ! HAAAA!,7,Southpark,20,3,,,,,,,,,
63125,Stan,13,"What are you doing, Cartman?",7,Southpark,28,5,,,,,,,,,
63126,Cartman,13,They're going to kill me! ,7,Southpark,26,5,,,,,,,,,
63127,Kyle,13,Who's going to kill you?,7,Southpark,24,5,,,,,,,,,
63128,Cartman,13,The anti-smoking people! They had me say I died from second-hand smoke and... now they want to sacrifice me to make it look real! They'll stop at nothing!!,7,Southpark,155,28,,,,,,,,,
63129,Stan,13,"Well, get away from us then.",7,Southpark,28,6,,,,,,,,,
63130,Kyle,13,"Yeah dude, don't get us killed too. ",7,Southpark,36,7,,,,,,,,,
63131,Cartman,13,You guys have to help me!,7,Southpark,25,6,,,,,,,,,
63132,Kyle,13,"No dude, get away!",7,Southpark,18,4,,,,,,,,,
63133,Cartman,13,"Please, you guys, I don't know what to do!",7,Southpark,42,9,,,,,,,,,
63134,Stan,13,"Stop it, Cartman! Go die on your own!",7,Southpark,37,8,,,,,,,,,
63135,Cartman,13,"If I go, you guys go!",7,Southpark,21,6,,,,,,,,,
63136,Stan,13,Daaaad!,7,Southpark,7,1,,,,,,,,,
63137,Randy,13,What?,7,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
63138,Stan,13,Anti-smoking people are trying to kill Cartman and he won't stay away from us.,7,Southpark,78,14,,,,,,,,,
63139,Randy,13,"Don't be ridiculous, boys. The anti-smoking people are kind, caring, and intelligent. Your heads have just been corrupted by the lies of the big tobacco companies. ",7,Southpark,164,26,,,,,,,,,
63140,Cartman,13,"Hey, maybe that's it, you guys. Maybe the tobacco company can help us! ",7,Southpark,71,13,,,,,,,,,
63141,Stan,13,"Help you, fatass! We weren't in the commercial, remember?",7,Southpark,57,9,,,,,,,,,
63142,Kyle,13,Yeah! Go to the tobacco company yourself!,7,Southpark,41,7,,,,,,,,,
63143,Cartman,13,"Well that's fine. I thought you guys were my friends, but I guess I was wrong! ",7,Southpark,79,16,,,,,,,,,
63144,Kyle,13,Yeah dude. You were totally wrong.,7,Southpark,34,6,,,,,,,,,
63145,Kenny,13,,7,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
63146,Cartman,13,"You guys, I am seriously gettin' pissed off heh! Now come on, we're goin' to the tobacco company.",7,Southpark,97,18,,,,,,,,,
63147,Stan,13,Oh all right.,7,Southpark,13,3,,,,,,,,,
63148,Kyle,13,No! What we really should do is go to our parents right now and take responsibility for smoking ourselves. Even if it means getting grounded.,7,Southpark,141,25,,,,,,,,,
63149,Stan,13,Why?,7,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
63150,Kyle,13,"Because, if we go to the tobacco company, I know exactly what'll happen. They'll take us in, and then Rob Reiner will show up with all the townspeople, holding torches or something, and there'll be a big showdown until we talk about what we learned, and change everyone's minds - this is all following a formula!",7,Southpark,312,56,,,,,,,,,
63151,Stan,13,"So it's either deal with all that, or be grounded for three weeks. ",7,Southpark,67,13,,,,,,,,,
63152,Kyle,13,God-damnit! ,7,Southpark,12,1,,,,,,,,,
63159,Randy,13,Wha- what the hell is wrong with you? That's not right.,7,Southpark,55,11,,,,,,,,,
63161,Kyle,13,"No it isn't, you fat turd! Because, I've learned something today. You just hate-  See, I knew it.",7,Southpark,97,18,,,,,,,,,
63162,Stan,13,Yup.,7,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
63163,Kyle,13,"You just hate smoking, so you use all your money and power to force others to think like you. And that's called fascism, you tubby asshole!",7,Southpark,139,26,,,,,,,,,
63165,Stan,13,"It wasn't the tobacco companies' fault that we smoked. It was our fault, us! We should all take personal responsibility instead of letting fat fascists like him tell us what to do!",7,Southpark,180,32,,,,,,,,,
63169,Mr. Garrison,13,"Hey Mr. Reiner, why don't you Butt Out! ",7,Southpark,40,8,,,,,,,,,
63171,Cartman,13,"I don't idolize you anymore, asshole! ",7,Southpark,38,6,,,,,,,,,
63174,Kyle,13,No.,7,Southpark,3,1,,,,,,,,,
63177,Cartman,13,Aw awww!,7,Southpark,8,2,,,,,,,,,
63178,Stan,13,"Well, I guess we learned our lesson.",7,Southpark,36,7,,,,,,,,,
63179,Kyle,13,"No we didn't, dude! No we didn't! ",7,Southpark,34,7,,,,,,,,,
63180,Stan,14,"All right, you guys, it's first down. I'll hike the ball on the third ""set hut!"" Kyle and Cartman, go deep post out. Kenny, run a slant down the middle. Butters, be ready for the screen.",7,Southpark,186,36,,,,,,,,,
63181,Cartman,14,Right. What are we playing again?,7,Southpark,33,6,,,,,,,,,
63182,Stan,14,Football.,7,Southpark,9,1,,,,,,,,,
63183,Cartman,14,Got it. ,7,Southpark,8,2,,,,,,,,,
63184,Stan,14,"Okay. 23!  Blue, 23! Set hut! Set hut! ",7,Southpark,39,8,,,,,,,,,
63186,Stan,14,What? ,7,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
63188,Stan,14,"Oh whoa, wait a minute.  What did I do wrong? I haven't even talked to Wendy for weeks.  ",7,Southpark,89,18,,,,,,,,,
63190,Cartman,14,"What-ever, Bebe! Like Stan really cares! Just get out of our football game, you stupid skank!",7,Southpark,93,16,,,,,,,,,
63192,Butters,14,"Oh yeah? Well, at least we have assholes, you dumb girl!",7,Southpark,56,11,,,,,,,,,
63193,Cartman,14,"Yeh-heah, right!",7,Southpark,16,2,,,,,,,,,
63195,Cartman,14,What a whore! ,7,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,
63196,Kyle,14,Yeah! Like Stan gives a crap if Wendy breaks up!  Stan? ,7,Southpark,56,11,,,,,,,,,
63197,Cartman,14,"Come on, Stan, it's first down still. ",7,Southpark,38,7,,,,,,,,,
63198,Stan,14,"Kyle, will you talk to Wendy for me?",7,Southpark,36,8,,,,,,,,,
63199,Kyle,14,Why?,7,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
63200,Stan,14,'Cause I need to know why she broke up.,7,Southpark,39,9,,,,,,,,,
63201,Kyle,14,"Aw, dude, come on. I gotta do my science homework.",7,Southpark,50,10,,,,,,,,,
63202,Stan,14,"Dude, please. I might still have a chance to make things work. Please, just go talk to her?",7,Southpark,91,18,,,,,,,,,
63203,Kyle,14,"God damn it!  Wendy, Stan wants to know why you break up. ",7,Southpark,58,12,,,,,,,,,
63205,Kyle,14,"'K.  She says she's been wantin' to break up for a while, and it's nothing against you.",7,Southpark,87,17,,,,,,,,,
63206,Stan,14,What? That's no answer!  Go tell her to be more direct with me.,7,Southpark,63,13,,,,,,,,,
63207,Kyle,14,"No dude, I'm out. Go talk to her yourself. Be poetic. ",7,Southpark,54,11,,,,,,,,,
63208,Stan,14,"Kyle, this is my life.  Jimmy!",7,Southpark,30,6,,,,,,,,,
63210,Stan,14,"Jimmy, will you go talk to Wendy for me?",7,Southpark,40,9,,,,,,,,,
63212,Stan,14,"Just go talk to her an, and be poetic. Tell her she's my Muse-no! Tell her,  tell her...  she's a con-tinuing source of inspiration to me.",7,Southpark,138,26,,,,,,,,,
63214,Stan,14,She's a continuing source of inspiration to me.,7,Southpark,47,8,,,,,,,,,
63219,Stan,14,Well?,7,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
63221,Stan,14,Over?  Jesus...,7,Southpark,15,2,,,,,,,,,
63222,Butters,14,"We came over to cheer you up, Stan!",7,Southpark,35,8,,,,,,,,,
63223,Stan,14,...Go away.,7,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
63224,Kyle,14,"Stan, you can't keep doing this to yourself. You have to go live.",7,Southpark,65,13,,,,,,,,,
63225,Stan,14,Why? What's the point of living when the only girl I ever loved is gone?,7,Southpark,72,15,,,,,,,,,
63226,Cartman,14,"God, what a fag!",7,Southpark,16,4,,,,,,,,,
63227,Kyle,14,"Dude, not now! ",7,Southpark,15,3,,,,,,,,,
63228,Stan,14,"You guys have no idea how this feels. It's like, you always hear songs about a broken heart and you think it's just a figure of speech? But it's true. My chest hurts. I feel this like, sinking feeling where my heart is. It's broken...",7,Southpark,234,45,,,,,,,,,
63229,Kyle,14,"Jeez, he's worse than I thought.",7,Southpark,32,6,,,,,,,,,
63230,Butters,14,Well what do we do now?,7,Southpark,23,6,,,,,,,,,

63829,Butters,1,"Wowee! Hey, can I play, ninjas with you?",8,Southpark,40,8,,,,,,,,,

63836,Butters,1,"Hi Mom.  -a castaway, forced to live his life out in solitude.  And it's because of times like these I was forced to a life of evil.  Society cast me out, and so I vowed to make them all pay! And pay they did! Nobody knows that beneath this sweet eight-year-old little boy lies the most evil, the most destructive super-villain of all time!  Professor Chaos!  Let's see how you like dealing with me, ninjas!

63840,Butters,1,"Well, o- okay Mom.  Bah! Gah! ",8,Southpark,30,6,,,,,,,,,
63841,Stan,1,"Hm, this doesn't seem to be the right way. My ninja sense is telling me we might be heading in the wrong direction.",8,Southpark,115,23,,,,,,,,,
63842,Kyle,1,"Okay, hang on guys. I'll use my special power to see into the future and find out where we should head next.",8,Southpark,108,22,,,,,,,,,
63843,Cartman,1,"Hold on you guys. I actually have another power. I can see into the future too, but better than Kyle. Let me try it.",8,Southpark,116,24,,,,,,,,,
63844,Kyle,1,"God dammit, Cartman! You can't keep making up new powers!",8,Southpark,57,10,,,,,,,,,
63845,Stan,1,"Yeah dude, that's like the fifth power you've come up with!",8,Southpark,59,11,,,,,,,,,
63846,Cartman,1,I am Bulrog and I have lots and lots of powers.,8,Southpark,47,11,,,,,,,,,
63847,Kyle,1,No asshole! From now on you only get to have one power! So what is it?!,8,Southpark,71,16,,,,,,,,,

63864,Kyle,1,"Well, let's see how he likes the icy blasts from my nunchucks of Sokuromoto! ",8,Southpark,77,14,,,,,,,,,
63865,Butters,1,"Huh nice attempt, ninja! But now both of you shall feel the power of my Web of Holding!  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! You are both trapped in spiderwebs! ",8,Southpark,145,29,,,,,,,,,
63866,Cartman,1,"All right, dickhole! Time for you to pay!  Oh no! I have no powers! Kyle took them away from me! Quick, Kyle, give me back my powers so I can fight this evil villain!",8,Southpark,166,34,,,,,,,,,

63875,Stan,1,"Butters! Oh my God!  Oh, dude! It's stuck in his eye!",8,Southpark,53,11,,,,,,,,,
63876,Kyle,1,"What the hell did you do that for, Kenny?!",8,Southpark,42,9,,,,,,,,,
63877,Kenny,1,,8,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
63878,Butters,1,It hurts! It hurts! ,8,Southpark,20,4,,,,,,,,,
63879,Kyle,1,Oh man! We are in serious trouble!,8,Southpark,34,7,,,,,,,,,

63881,Butters,1,But I... But I... But I can't see nothin'. I gotta go to the hospital! ,8,Southpark,71,15,,,,,,,,,
63882,Stan,1,"Okay okay, calm down, Butters! It'll be okay! ",8,Southpark,46,8,,,,,,,,,
63883,Cartman,1,"Guys, meeting over here for a second?  All right you guys, we need to stay calm and just do the right thing. We have to kill Butters and bury him in Kyle's backyard.",8,Southpark,165,33,,,,,,,,,
63884,Stan,1,"Dude, shut up!",8,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,
63885,Kyle,1,I agree with Cartman!,8,Southpark,21,4,,,,,,,,,
63886,Stan,1,What?!,8,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
63887,Kyle,1,You don't understand what my mom will do to me if she finds out I was playing with weapons!,8,Southpark,91,19,,,,,,,,,

63895,Kyle,1,"God? Please, if you get me out of this, I swear, I will never play with weapons ever again.",8,Southpark,91,19,,,,,,,,,
63896,Cartman,1,"Don't be so quick to throw off your ninja responsibility, Kyle.  Now, come on guys, sure, it's easy to be a ninja when everything's going your way, but it's times like these, when the chips are down, that a ninja shows his true character.",8,Southpark,238,44,,,,,,,,,
63897,Butters,1,"Whoa, I'm getting woozy.",8,Southpark,24,4,,,,,,,,,
63898,Cartman,1,"Shut up, Butters.  Now, there's a way out of this. We just have to use our... ninja reasoning. ",8,Southpark,95,18,,,,,,,,,

63903,Kyle,1,Oh no.,8,Southpark,6,2,,,,,,,,,
63904,Stan,1,We might pass him off as our pet.,8,Southpark,33,8,,,,,,,,,
63905,Butters,1,"But, but fellas, if I, if I dress up like a dog with a star in my eye, I- I'm gonna get grounded.",8,Southpark,97,23,,,,,,,,,
63907,Kyle,1,"That is the dumbest idea you guys have ever come up with! I'd expect this stupidity out of Cartman, but you, Stan?! Butters needs medical attention right now!",8,Southpark,158,28,,,,,,,,,
63908,Stan,1,"All right, then you take him to the hospital, Kyle. You take him to the hospital and let your mom find out what happened.",8,Southpark,121,24,,,,,,,,,

63916,Stan,1,"Okay, it's clear. ",8,Southpark,18,3,,,,,,,,,
63917,Cartman,1,"Now remember, Butters, when you get to the vet's office, you need to stay down on all fours and- Butters, listen! At the vet's office, you need to stay down on all fours and bark a lot.",8,Southpark,185,37,,,,,,,,,
63918,Butters,1,"Wuhuff, woof, woof.",8,Southpark,19,3,,,,,,,,,
63919,Kyle,1,"We've gotta hurry, it's getting late! ",8,Southpark,38,6,,,,,,,,,

64149,Cartman,2,"All right, Mom, look. Here's .. the truth.  God, this is gonna be hard to say.  I think, Mom, that I've been hard on some of the handicapped kids at school in the past. I've sometimes looked at people with disabilities as people God put here on earth for my amusement, but... now I'm starting to think... that if I could just spend one day in their shoes... if I could just see the challenges they face every day... maybe I wouldn't be so cold.

64415,Stan,3,"Uh, we saw your movie, The Passion, and we didn't like it, so, can we have our money back, please?",8,Southpark,98,20,,,,,,,,,
64417,Stan,3,"Look, dude, we came a long way. We're not leaving until you give us our money.",8,Southpark,78,16,,,,,,,,,
64419,Stan,3,Tor- torture you?,8,Southpark,17,3,,,,,,,,,
64421,Stan,3,We don't want to torture you.,8,Southpark,29,6,,,,,,,,,
64423,Stan,3,"Dude, can we please just have the eighteen dollars back from you?",8,Southpark,65,12,,,,,,,,,
64425,Stan,3,"Dude, this guy is freakin' daffy!",8,Southpark,33,6,,,,,,,,,
64428,Kyle,3,"Oh okay, but did God sent Jesus TO die, or did Jesus just get kind of screwed over.",8,Southpark,83,18,,,,,,,,,
64430,Kyle,3,"Well, I have this friend, see? And this friend belongs to a certain, Chosen People of Israel. And it... so happens that these chosen people killed your Lord.",8,Southpark,157,28,,,,,,,,,
64432,Kyle,3,"Right. But he can't live with the guilt anymore. Because, even if Jesus wasn't really the Son of God, he was still a nice guy. And he didn't deserve what happened to him in Mel Gibson's movie. I I can't sleep at night. I mean, my... friend can't sleep at night.",8,Southpark,261,51,,,,,,,,,
64434,Kyle,3,But how can the Jews make it better??,8,Southpark,37,8,,,,,,,,,
64436,Kyle,3,"Wait. That's it. Atonement. Of course.  I know what I have to do now. Thank you, Father. ",8,Southpark,89,17,,,,,,,,,
64439,Stan,3,Mel Gibson is fucking crazy dude!  Wait! There's his wallet! ,8,Southpark,61,10,,,,,,,,,
64441,Stan,3,"Awww crap, he's only got twenties! You got two dollars, Kenny? ",8,Southpark,63,11,,,,,,,,,
64443,Stan,3,"All right, let's get the hell out of here! ",8,Southpark,43,9,,,,,,,,,
64445,Stan,3,"Aah! Run, dude, run!",8,Southpark,20,4,,,,,,,,,
64447,Cartman,3,"One month ago today, this amazing film opened in theaters. And now, we proud few gather here as a people brought together by its message!  Fellow fans of Mel Gibson, our numbers have grown and now, together, we have the power to change the world!  Now I believe we should take to the streets and march in unwavering support of this important movie!",8,Southpark,348,63,,,,,,,,,
64451,Cartman,3,"And as we march for The Passion we should also voice our support! So, when I say ""Es ist Zeit f’_r S’_uberung,"" you all chant back ""Wir m’_ssen die Juden ausrotten.""",8,Southpark,165,31,,,,,,,,,
64457,Cartman,3,Wir m’_ssen die Juden ausrotten!! ,8,Southpark,34,5,,,,,,,,,
64459,Cartman,3,Es ist Zeit f’âr Rache!,8,Southpark,23,5,,,,,,,,,
64462,Cartman,3,"All right, everyone! Forward, march!  Es ist Zeit f’_r Rache!",8,Southpark,61,10,,,,,,,,,
64464,Cartman,3,Es ist Zeit f’_r Rache!,8,Southpark,23,5,,,,,,,,,
64466,Cartman,3,Nice.,8,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
64468,Kyle,3,"Thank you, rabbi.  In 1973, the United States officially issued an apology to the African American community for slavery. In 1956, Germany officially apologized for World War II AND the Holocaust. And now, I believe, in 2004, the Jewish community needs to apologize for the death of Jesus.",8,Southpark,289,48,,,,,,,,,
64471,Kyle,3,"If we as a people choose not to believe that Jesus is the Son of God, then we can still apologize for the brutal way in which he was killed, and take our share of the responsibility for it.",8,Southpark,189,39,,,,,,,,,
64474,Kyle,3,I saw The Passion!,8,Southpark,18,4,,,,,,,,,
64482,Cartman,3,Es ist Zeit f’_r Rache! ,8,Southpark,24,5,,,,,,,,,
64484,Cartman,3,Es ist Zeit f’_r Rache!,8,Southpark,23,5,,,,,,,,,
64486,Cartman,3,Es ist Zeit f’_r Rache!,8,Southpark,23,5,,,,,,,,,
64487,Stan,3,Well it looks like with these bus tickets we spend about eighty... seven dollars getting our money back from Mel Gibson.  But I think it's the principle of the thing that matters.,8,Southpark,179,32,,,,,,,,,
64488,Kenny,3, ,8,Southpark,1,0,,,,,,,,,
64489,Stan,3,"Oh, you've got to be shittin' me. ",8,Southpark,34,7,,,,,,,,,
64491,Stan,3,"Goddamn, that guy's crazy.  Hey dude, you've gotta speed up.",8,Southpark,60,10,,,,,,,,,
64493,Stan,3,Mel Gibson is chasing after us. You've gotta go faster.,8,Southpark,55,10,,,,,,,,,
64495,Stan,3,I'm not playing games. Mel Gibson is right behind you and he's gonna- ,8,Southpark,70,13,,,,,,,,,
64499,Stan,3,Yeah. I told you that!,8,Southpark,22,5,,,,,,,,,
64501,Stan,3,"He wouldn't give us our money back for The Passion, so we kinda took it.",8,Southpark,72,15,,,,,,,,,
64503,Kyle,3,"Both you guys, stop! Please. You're gonna make people hate us more!",8,Southpark,67,12,,,,,,,,,
64510,Kyle,3,"No, no, no! Don't become an angry mob!  The last time we did that we killed Jesus!",8,Southpark,82,17,,,,,,,,,
64511,Cartman,3,Juden!,8,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
64521,Kyle,3,Look out!! ,8,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
64523,Cartman,3,"Mel! Gibson!  Oh mein Savior! Mein F’_hrer! You're actually here! Mr. Gibson, I have assembled the masses! We are ready to do thy bidding!  Have I been a good boy, Mr. Gibson?!",8,Southpark,176,32,,,,,,,,,
64528,Kyle,3,"Dude, what's wrong with him?",8,Southpark,28,5,,,,,,,,,
64529,Stan,3,"He's koo-koo, dude. He's absolutely out of his mind.",8,Southpark,52,9,,,,,,,,,
64531,Kyle,3,Dude! I've been freaked out this whole time because of that guy's movie?,8,Southpark,72,13,,,,,,,,,
64533,Stan,3,It's our eighteen dollars! Your movie sucked!,8,Southpark,45,7,,,,,,,,,
64535,Stan,3,"No, dude, if you wanna be Christian, that's cool, but, you should follow what Jesus taught instead of how he got killed. Focusing on how he got killed is what people did in the Dark Ages and it ends up with really bad results.",8,Southpark,226,44,,,,,,,,,
64538,Cartman,3,"Aw, aw, no, come on, people, we're so close to completing my final solution!",8,Southpark,76,14,,,,,,,,,
64539,Kyle,3,"Oh, dude, I feel so much better about being Jewish now that I see that Mel Gibson is just a big wacko douche. ",8,Southpark,110,23,,,,,,,,,
64541,Cartman,4,"Dude, these little remote-controlled cars are kickass. ",8,Southpark,55,7,,,,,,,,,
64542,Kyle,4,Sweet. I made mine go off the jump. ,8,Southpark,36,8,,,,,,,,,
64543,Stan,4,"Dude, my car sucks. I gotta get a new one. ",8,Southpark,43,10,,,,,,,,,
64544,Kyle,4,"Hey, who are those kids? ",8,Southpark,25,5,,,,,,,,,
64560,Kyle,4,...What the hell just happened?,8,Southpark,31,5,,,,,,,,,
64561,Chef,4,"Oh. Hello there, children!",8,Southpark,26,4,,,,,,,,,
64562,Stan,4,"Chef, we just got served.",8,Southpark,25,5,,,,,,,,,
64563,Chef,4,"Oh boy... Well come on inside, children. I'll make you some cocoa.",8,Southpark,66,12,,,,,,,,,
64564,Chef,4,"Have a seat, children. Just try to relax and breathe.  Are you all okay?",8,Southpark,72,14,,,,,,,,,
64565,Kyle,4,Yeah.,8,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
64566,Chef,4,"All right. Now, where did you get served?",8,Southpark,41,8,,,,,,,,,
64567,Stan,4,"Over at the True Value parking lot. There were just these kids we never saw before showed up and they were like, really good dancers and, we don't really understand what it means, but I guess-",8,Southpark,192,36,,,,,,,,,
64568,Chef,4,"Okay okay, relax children. Relax. It's all over now. Just try to calm down and sit tight.  I'm gonna call your parents and let them know you're okay.  Mrs. Marsh? Hi, it's Chef. Yeah, I'm good. Listen: Stan and his friends just got served. Yeah. Yeah, over at the True Value. No no, he's fine. They're all fine. Yeah, it was some kids from out of town. Apparently they were pretty good dancers. They really let 'em have it.",8,Southpark,423,79,,,,,,,,,
64570,Randy,4,What's the matter with him?,8,Southpark,27,5,,,,,,,,,
64572,Randy,4,You got served? By who?,8,Southpark,23,5,,,,,,,,,
64573,Stan,4,"Some, kids from Orange County.",8,Southpark,30,5,,,,,,,,,
64575,Randy,4,So wha- so what'd you do? D'you dance back?,8,Southpark,43,9,,,,,,,,,
64576,Stan,4,No.,8,Southpark,3,1,,,,,,,,,
64577,Randy,4,What? Yo-you got served and just stood there and took it?,8,Southpark,57,11,,,,,,,,,
64579,Randy,4,"No, that's crap, Sharon. Stanley, when somebody challenges you to dance, you have to dance back at them, or else they'll think you're weak.",8,Southpark,139,24,,,,,,,,,
64580,Stan,4,"But Dad, I don't know how to dance or nothin'.",8,Southpark,46,10,,,,,,,,,
64581,Randy,4,"Well then, it's about time you learned!  Put on some loose-fitting clothes and meet me in the garage!",8,Southpark,101,18,,,,,,,,,
64582,Stan,4,But Dad-,8,Southpark,8,2,,,,,,,,,
64583,Randy,4,Now! ,8,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
64584,Randy,4,"All right son, dancing is all about a frame of mind. Now, I'm not telling you to go around challenging other kids to dance, but when they challenge you, you just look 'em straight in the eye, and give 'em this.  Come on, Stan.  ...six, seven, eight. ",8,Southpark,250,47,,,,,,,,,
64585,Kyle,4,"Dude, that is a sweet RC car!",8,Southpark,29,7,,,,,,,,,
64586,Stan,4,"Yeah, let's go race it right now!",8,Southpark,33,7,,,,,,,,,
64590,Kyle,4,"We're not interested, thanks.",8,Southpark,29,4,,,,,,,,,
64599,Kyle,4,Yeah! Go Stan!,8,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,
64600,Chef,4,"Oh no!  No, stop Stan! You don't know what you're doin'! ",8,Southpark,57,11,,,,,,,,,
64601,Kyle,4,All right Stan!,8,Southpark,15,3,,,,,,,,,
64602,Cartman,4,Ha! You just got f'd in the a!,8,Southpark,30,8,,,,,,,,,

64612,Stan,4,What?,8,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
64616,Chef,4,Oh dammit! I knew that was gonna happen.,8,Southpark,40,8,,,,,,,,,
64620,Chef,4,"Stan, what the hell did you dance back for?",8,Southpark,43,9,,,,,,,,,
64621,Stan,4,I thought I was supposed to!,8,Southpark,28,6,,,,,,,,,
64622,Chef,4,Now you've gotta compete against them in the dance competition on Saturday!,8,Southpark,75,12,,,,,,,,,
64623,Stan,4,But why?,8,Southpark,8,2,,,,,,,,,
64624,Chef,4,"Because if you get served and served them back, then it's on! Don't you know anything??",8,Southpark,87,16,,,,,,,,,
64626,Randy,4,What?,8,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
64628,Randy,4,So what happened?,8,Southpark,17,3,,,,,,,,,
64639,Randy,4,"Uh, hey, ex- excuse me.",8,Southpark,23,5,,,,,,,,,
64641,Randy,4,"Hi, uh, my name is Randy Marsh. I'm I'm Stan Marsh's father.",8,Southpark,60,12,,,,,,,,,
64645,Randy,4,"Uh, listen. Uh, it was my fault that Stanley served your boys the other day. Uh, I told him to do it and I... We- well look I, I just came down here to tell you... it-  it- it's not on.",8,Southpark,185,41,,,,,,,,,

64649,Randy,4,It isn't on. Nothing's on. It's off.,8,Southpark,36,7,,,,,,,,,
64651,Randy,4,I'm keeping my son home Saturday. I just came by to let you know so you can... put a stop to all this. Goodbye. ,8,Southpark,112,24,,,,,,,,,
64656,Randy,4,"Aw, mph! Uuuugh-ah.",8,Southpark,19,3,,,,,,,,,
64661,Chef,4,Oh Lord...,8,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,
64662,Randy,4,"His dancing was so fast I... couldn't do anything. His moves were... so original, so inventive.  Ungh! Grrgh.",8,Southpark,109,18,,,,,,,,,
64667,Stan,4,"I, I don't know. He seems all right.",8,Southpark,36,8,,,,,,,,,
64668,Mr. Garrison,4,"I could only imagine the rage building inside you, Stan. I bet you can't wait to out-dance those OC bastards!",8,Southpark,109,20,,,,,,,,,
64669,Randy,4,Stan? Stan?,8,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
64670,Stan,4,"Yeah, I'm- I'm right here, Dad.",8,Southpark,31,6,,,,,,,,,
64671,Randy,4,"Stan, listen to me. I don't want you feeling like you have to do that competition now to avenge me.",8,Southpark,99,20,,,,,,,,,
64672,Stan,4,"Okay, good.",8,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
64673,Randy,4,"But I know I can't stop you from doing it. So all I can say is... give 'em hell, son. Give 'em hell. ",8,Southpark,101,23,,,,,,,,,
64674,Stan,4,God dammit!,8,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
64675,Stan,4,"Hey guys. Uh- You guys know how to dance, right?",8,Southpark,48,10,,,,,,,,,
64677,Stan,4,"Cool, because, there's this competition on Saturday, and I have to find the very best dancers in South Park to be on my crew. My friends can't do it because they suck ass, so, will you be in my dance troupe?",8,Southpark,207,41,,,,,,,,,
64680,Stan,4,"Okay, that'll work fine. Listen, there's a dance competition this Saturday and I need good dancers so I don't get served.",8,Southpark,121,21,,,,,,,,,
64682,Stan,4,"Please, you guys, our whole town's reputation is at stake! Will any of you do it?",8,Southpark,81,16,,,,,,,,,
64687,Stan,4,Great! ,8,Southpark,7,1,,,,,,,,,

64708,Stan,4,Oh yeah.  Wait a minute. I know just where to go!,8,Southpark,49,11,,,,,,,,,
64710,Stan,4,Ah actually we were just hoping we could talk to you guys real quick.,8,Southpark,69,14,,,,,,,,,
64712,Stan,4,And so we're putting all the best dancers in South Park together to beat Orange County.,8,Southpark,87,16,,,,,,,,,
64714,Stan,4,So you'll do it?,8,Southpark,16,4,,,,,,,,,
64716,Stan,4,"All right, we just need one more person!",8,Southpark,40,8,,,,,,,,,

64725,Butters,4,"Wow, neat-o, a competition? Why, I'd love to. What kind of competition is it?",8,Southpark,77,14,,,,,,,,,
64726,Stan,4,It's a dance-off. We heard you were tap dancing state champion two years ago. ,8,Southpark,78,14,,,,,,,,,
64727,Butters,4,...No.,8,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
64728,Stan,4,"But, you were, weren't you? Y-you went to the nationals in Nebraska.",8,Southpark,68,12,,,,,,,,,
64729,Butters,4,"No.  No no no no no no, no!  No! No no no no!",8,Southpark,45,13,,,,,,,,,

64734,Butters,4,Waaaaah!,8,Southpark,8,1,,,,,,,,,
64736,Stan,4,"Dammit, where are we gonna get our fifth member?",8,Southpark,48,9,,,,,,,,,
64738,Stan,4,"A duck? Dude, don't be stupid! Those OC kids are professional dancers! Now come on, there's gotta be one other talented person in South Park.",8,Southpark,141,25,,,,,,,,,
64739,Butters,4,Aaaaah!  Aaaaah!,8,Southpark,16,2,,,,,,,,,
64740,Stan,4,"All right, so you're sure he can dance?",8,Southpark,39,8,,,,,,,,,
64744,Stan,4,"Hey, he- Is that the only song he'll dance to?",8,Southpark,46,10,,,,,,,,,
64746,Stan,4,"My friends, I think we have ourselves a dance troupe.",8,Southpark,53,10,,,,,,,,,
64748,Butters,4,Two years ago. Two years ago!,8,Southpark,29,6,,,,,,,,,
64751,Butters,4,Whoops. ,8,Southpark,8,1,,,,,,,,,
64753,Butters,4,Wuuuhaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaah!  No! Nooo! Noooooooooooooooo!,8,Southpark,55,5,,,,,,,,,
64754,Chef,4,"All right, children, let's get to rehearsin'!  We don't have much time, and you've got to become the dance group you can be.  I think we should-  Whoa.  This... is the dance troupe?",8,Southpark,181,33,,,,,,,,,
64755,Stan,4,"Yeah, dude, the best dancers South Park has to offer.",8,Southpark,53,10,,,,,,,,,

64758,Chef,4,"Oh Lord have mercy.  Children, children! No no, you've got it all wrong. Don't you see, children? You have the heart, but you don't have the soul. No no, wait. You have the soul, but you don't have the heart.  No no, scratch that. You have the heart and the soul, but you don't have the talent.",8,Southpark,294,57,,,,,,,,,
64759,Stan,4,"We're gonna get served on Saturday, aren't we?",8,Southpark,46,8,,,,,,,,,
64762,Stan,4,Well that was the whole point of the whole thing was that the guys came back and they said we were gonna get served and we were like- ,8,Southpark,134,28,,,,,,,,,
64763,Chef,4,"All right all right, quiet, children! Now, nobody's getting served if I can help it. We just gotta buckle down, dig deep, and pray that maybe the other team comes down with cancer. ",8,Southpark,181,33,,,,,,,,,
64764,Butters,4,What do you want?,8,Southpark,17,4,,,,,,,,,
64765,Stan,4,"I came to ask you one more time to join the crew. Everyone is practicing really hard, but... I don't think we have any kind of shot without you.",8,Southpark,144,29,,,,,,,,,
64766,Butters,4,"Sorry, Stan, I'm not a dancer anymore.  I gave that up.",8,Southpark,55,11,,,,,,,,,
64767,Stan,4,Your mom says you were one of the best dancers in the country.,8,Southpark,62,13,,,,,,,,,
64768,Butters,4,Did she also tell you my dancing got eight people killed?,8,Southpark,57,11,,,,,,,,,
64769,Stan,4,Yeah. She said your shoe came off. It wasn't your fault,8,Southpark,55,11,,,,,,,,,
64770,Butters,4,"Yeah well, you tell that to their families. ",8,Southpark,44,8,,,,,,,,,
64771,Stan,4,"Look, Butters, accidents happen. We all have to live with that.",8,Southpark,63,11,,,,,,,,,
64772,Butters,4,"I let those people down! Don't you get it, man?! Eight people died!",8,Southpark,67,13,,,,,,,,,
64773,Stan,4,"Well, it was nine, actually. One of the women was pregnant.",8,Southpark,59,11,,,,,,,,,
64774,Butters,4,What?,8,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
64775,Stan,4,And eleven if you count the two family members that killed themselves afterward.,8,Southpark,80,13,,,,,,,,,
64776,Butters,4,Aaaah!,8,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
64777,Stan,4,"But that isn't the point, Butters!  The point is that this is now! It's on! And there are people who need you to step up! Look, nobody likes having to rise to a challenge. But competing against other people and getting in their faces saying ""Haha! I'm better than you!"" is part of life. And if you can't face that, then you might as well sit here and play Legos until you're an old man.",8,Southpark,386,75,,,,,,,,,
64778,Butters,4,"Get out of my room, Stan.",8,Southpark,25,6,,,,,,,,,
64779,Stan,4,"Fine.  But someday you're gonna have to stop running from what happened and start dealing with it. Otherwise, you might as well move to France with all the other pussies. ",8,Southpark,171,30,,,,,,,,,
64784,Mr. Garrison,4,"Aww, yeah.",8,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,
64788,Stan,4,What?,8,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
64790,Stan,4,What happened??,8,Southpark,15,2,,,,,,,,,
64794,Stan,4,"Aw, what do we do, Chef?!",8,Southpark,25,6,,,,,,,,,
64795,Chef,4,"Rules are you have to have five dancers. We have no choice, children. We have to forfeit.",8,Southpark,89,17,,,,,,,,,
64798,Butters,4,Hey! Can I still dance with you guys?,8,Southpark,37,8,,,,,,,,,
64799,Stan,4,Butters! ,8,Southpark,9,1,,,,,,,,,
64800,Chef,4,All right!,8,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,
64803,Butters,4,"Waaah!  No! Jesus, not again!",8,Southpark,29,5,,,,,,,,,
64808,Mr. Garrison,4,Yeah!,8,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,

65149,Kyle,6,What?,8,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
65151,Kyle,6,So you never met your mom?,8,Southpark,26,6,,,,,,,,,
65153,Kyle,6,"Yeah. Yeah, that counts.",8,Southpark,24,4,,,,,,,,,
65154,Cartman,6,"Oh man, that was great! You guys know what Mr. Jefferson said? He said I'm his best friend, and I can go over to his house whenever I want! I'm supposed to go right back over there after dinner tonight!",8,Southpark,202,40,,,,,,,,,
65155,Kyle,6,"You guys, I feel kinda bad for that kid.",8,Southpark,40,9,,,,,,,,,
65156,Cartman,6,You feel bad for him?! He has everything a kid could want!,8,Southpark,58,12,,,,,,,,,
65157,Kyle,6,"Mr. Jefferson just seems like he wants to be a kid, not have one.",8,Southpark,65,14,,,,,,,,,
65158,Cartman,6,"Oh, you know what?! This makes perfect sense! A guy moves into South Park with a FERRIS wheel in his back yard, and KYLE has to see a problem with it!  Mr. Jefferson is the best thing that's happened to this town in a long time, and if you miss this up, so help me god, I will rip your balls off with my bare hands! With my bare hands, Goddamn you!

65159,Randy,6,"Well, there he is. Where have you been all afternoon.",8,Southpark,53,10,,,,,,,,,

65174,Stan,6,"Fine, Mom.",8,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,
65176,Kyle,6,They're TV dinners. Don't you wanna take that veil off so you can eat?,8,Southpark,70,14,,,,,,,,,
65178,Cartman,6,What the hell is going on?! Are you having Mr. Jefferson over for dinner?!,8,Southpark,74,14,,,,,,,,,

65202,Stan,6,He just showed up here.,8,Southpark,23,5,,,,,,,,,
65203,Cartman,6,"Remember, Mr. Jefferson? You said we were best friends. ",8,Southpark,56,9,,,,,,,,,
65204,Stan,6,Jesus Christ! ,8,Southpark,14,2,,,,,,,,,
65205,Kyle,6,"Dude, look who I found prowling around in my back yard.",8,Southpark,55,11,,,,,,,,,
65207,Kyle,6,He was out all alone in the middle of the night. Mr. Jefferson isn't even home.,8,Southpark,79,16,,,,,,,,,
65208,Stan,6,I know. He's here.,8,Southpark,18,4,,,,,,,,,
65209,Kyle,6,What?!,8,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
65211,Stan,6,"No! Mr. Jefferson, you need to take your son home.",8,Southpark,50,10,,,,,,,,,

65229,Stan,6,Yeah. A really bad dream.  Oh Jesus!,8,Southpark,36,7,,,,,,,,,
65241,Randy,6,"Stan, time to get up for school.  Stan? What the-?  Mr. Jefferson?!",8,Southpark,67,12,,,,,,,,,
65243,Randy,6,"Mr. Jefferson, this is highly inappropriate!",8,Southpark,44,6,,,,,,,,,
65245,Randy,6,"Wow, I'm gonna go buy that new sport coat I've been wanting. ",8,Southpark,61,12,,,,,,,,,
65248,Stan,6,"You don't have to tell us twice, Mom. That guy's a freak!",8,Southpark,57,12,,,,,,,,,
65249,Cartman,6,"Not go to Mr. Jefferson's anymore? Well, excuse my French, Mrs. Marsh, but you can suck my fat, hairy balls! ",8,Southpark,109,20,,,,,,,,,
65261,Kyle,6,That poor kid.,8,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,
65262,Stan,6,"Dude, come on. We're not supposed to go over there. ",8,Southpark,52,10,,,,,,,,,
65264,Kyle,6,"Hey Blanket. Uh, look, we're goin' over to help my dad chop wood. You... wanna come with?",8,Southpark,89,17,,,,,,,,,
65267,Stan,6,"Ah, actually, Mr. Jefferson, we were seeing if Blanket wanted to chop wood with us.",8,Southpark,83,15,,,,,,,,,
65269,Stan,6,"Mr. Jefferson, uh, it might be good for Blanket to learn how to chop wood.",8,Southpark,74,15,,,,,,,,,
65271,Kyle,6,"Jesus Christ, dude!",8,Southpark,19,3,,,,,,,,,
65273,Stan,6,"Stop, you fucking lunatic! ",8,Southpark,27,4,,,,,,,,,
65274,Kyle,6,"Dude, we have got to get that kid away from him!",8,Southpark,48,11,,,,,,,,,
65286,Cartman,6,"Mr. Jefferson? It's your best friend in the whole wide world, Eric Cartman. Mr. Jefferson? I came to sleep over tonight, remember?",8,Southpark,130,22,,,,,,,,,
65288,Kyle,6,"All right. Thanks a lot for helping us, dude.",8,Southpark,45,9,,,,,,,,,
65289,Kenny,6,"Yeah, sure, whatever. ",8,Southpark,22,3,,,,,,,,,
65290,Stan,6,You just gotta pretend you're Blanket until we can get the real Blanket somewhere safe.,8,Southpark,87,15,,,,,,,,,
65291,Kenny,6,Aren't I too big to be Blanket?,8,Southpark,31,7,,,,,,,,,
65292,Kyle,6,I don't think Mr. Jefferson pays enough attention to his son to notice. Come on! ,8,Southpark,81,15,,,,,,,,,
65293,Stan,6,"Blanket, you in here?",8,Southpark,21,4,,,,,,,,,
65295,Kyle,6,"Shh, Blanket, we're gonna take you away for a little while, okay? ",8,Southpark,66,12,,,,,,,,,
65297,Stan,6,"All right dude, get in his bed.",8,Southpark,31,7,,,,,,,,,
65298,Kenny,6,"All right, but you guys owe me for this.",8,Southpark,40,9,,,,,,,,,
65299,Stan,6,"Dude, whatever. At least you finally get to do something. ",8,Southpark,58,10,,,,,,,,,

65323,Kenny,6,"What the hell is going on, you guys?",8,Southpark,36,8,,,,,,,,,
65325,Kenny,6,"Nonono wait, I'm not Blanket!",8,Southpark,29,5,,,,,,,,,
65327,Kenny,6,"Aaaah! Aaaah, stop! A- ",8,Southpark,23,4,,,,,,,,,
65328,Stan,6,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!",8,Southpark,29,6,,,,,,,,,
65329,Kyle,6,You bastard! ,8,Southpark,13,2,,,,,,,,,
65332,Kyle,6,Come on!,8,Southpark,8,2,,,,,,,,,
65333,Stan,6,"Run, Blanket, Run!",8,Southpark,18,3,,,,,,,,,
65336,Kyle,6,"Hang on, Blanket! ",8,Southpark,18,3,,,,,,,,,
65339,Cartman,6,"No! I am sick and tired of people harassing Mr. Jefferson!  All I've been hearing since Mr. Jefferson moved here are sick lies! That he molests children, that he's a bad father, that he has plastic surgery!",8,Southpark,206,37,,,,,,,,,
65341,Cartman,6,"Sure, maybe Mr. Jefferson's a little different. But that's because he had to work all the time when he was young and missed out on his childhood. What's wrong with wanting to have the innocence and beauty of a child.",8,Southpark,216,40,,,,,,,,,
65342,Kyle,6,"All right, let's just say all the bad things said about Mr. Jefferson are lies! Let's say the police department does just go around spending their time framing people for crimes they didn't commit!  Let's say it's all made up, and Mr. Jefferson is just a nice guy who's trying to be a child because he never got to have a childhood. Well that's fine, except for that he HAS children now! And when people have children, they have to grow up!",8,Southpark,440,82,,,,,,,,,
65346,Kyle,6,All right! Things just might work out!,8,Southpark,38,7,,,,,,,,,
65349,Cartman,7,Hel-lo ma'am. We're going around town and offering snow-shoveling service. Would you like your driveway and sidewalk shoveled for eight thousand dollars?,8,Southpark,153,22,,,,,,,,,
65351,Cartman,7,"Ooo, ouch, ma'am, please, let go of that tight grip you have on my balls! Ten dollars, you're breaking my balls, ma'am!",8,Southpark,119,22,,,,,,,,,
65353,Cartman,7,"It's a deal! All right, guys, let's get to work!  Yeah, it's so totally awesome. Craig crapped his pants when he saw it. Yeah, sweet. So what's goin' on over there? Yeah, that's pretty cool.  No way! He did not! Aw dude, that is so weak.  What?",8,Southpark,244,47,,,,,,,,,
65354,Kyle,7,You've been on your fucking phone since we started!,8,Southpark,51,9,,,,,,,,,
65355,Cartman,7,"Dude, I'm takin' a break.",8,Southpark,25,5,,,,,,,,,
65356,Kyle,7,A break from what?! You haven't done anything!,8,Southpark,46,8,,,,,,,,,
65357,Cartman,7,"Kyle, how many times do we have to go through this? I'm the negotiator. I negotiate our price with the customers.",8,Southpark,113,21,,,,,,,,,
65358,Kyle,7,All you ever do is talk about your balls!,8,Southpark,41,9,,,,,,,,,
65359,Cartman,7,"It works, doesn't it? Did I not just get us an extra five bucks?",8,Southpark,64,14,,,,,,,,,
65360,Kyle,7,"If you want your share of the money, then you're gonna shovel snow like the rest of us!",8,Southpark,87,18,,,,,,,,,
65361,Cartman,7,"Hey! Don't boss me around, you fuckin' Jew! I will kick your ass!",8,Southpark,65,13,,,,,,,,,
65362,Stan,7,"Ma'am, do you have a rag and some bandages?",8,Southpark,43,9,,,,,,,,,
65364,Cartman,7,Shoveling accident.,8,Southpark,19,2,,,,,,,,,
65366,Cartman,7,"You're so lucky I have a... sore shoulder, Kyle, or I would have let you have it.",8,Southpark,81,17,,,,,,,,,
65367,Stan,7,"Cartman, just keep your mouth shut.",8,Southpark,35,6,,,,,,,,,
65370,Stan,7,Whoa.,8,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
65379,Stan,7,"Mom, Dad! Did you see? They found a man from the future!",8,Southpark,56,12,,,,,,,,,
65380,Randy,7,"We know, Stanley. We've been watching.",8,Southpark,38,6,,,,,,,,,
65384,Stan,7,"Mom, can we go try to see the people from the future? I have a bunch of questions I wanna ask 'em.",8,Southpark,98,22,,,,,,,,,
65386,Stan,7,"Night, Mom.  Wow, two people from the future. How cool.",8,Southpark,55,10,,,,,,,,,
65388,Stan,7,"Hello, Mrs. Landis. Would you like snow-shoveling service again today?",8,Southpark,70,10,,,,,,,,,
65390,Cartman,7,What?! Who?!,8,Southpark,12,2,,,,,,,,,
65392,Kyle,7,Twenty-five cents? Well that's not even worth it.,8,Southpark,49,8,,,,,,,,,
65393,Stan,7,"All right guys, come on. Let's go to the next house. ",8,Southpark,53,11,,,,,,,,,
65394,Kyle,7,Dude. ,8,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
65395,Stan,7,Son of a bitch!,8,Southpark,15,4,,,,,,,,,
65405,Stan,7,"It's affecting kids too! Me and my friends started our own snow-shoveling business. We were trying to be responsible and make money, you know? But then the people came along and, and now we're out of work too!  Oh, they took our jobs!",8,Southpark,234,43,,,,,,,,,
65408,Stan,7,I was at a rally to protest all the immigrants from the future coming in and tryin' tuh- ,8,Southpark,89,18,,,,,,,,,
65410,Stan,7,Who is that?,8,Southpark,12,3,,,,,,,,,
65411,Randy,7,"That's our new housekeeper, Mrs.  Gruhd. She's gonna help around the house on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  And she'll do it for ten cents an hour.",8,Southpark,142,25,,,,,,,,,
65412,Stan,7,"Oh, but that's the problem! Those goobacks are taking our jobs!",8,Southpark,63,11,,,,,,,,,
65414,Randy,7,"Oh my God!  Stan Marsh, how dare you use that time-bashing slur?!",8,Southpark,65,12,,,,,,,,,
65416,Stan,7,"Well dude, they are taking people's jobs away.",8,Southpark,46,8,,,,,,,,,
65417,Randy,7,They're only taking the small menial jobs that nobody else really wants to do.,8,Southpark,78,14,,,,,,,,,
65418,Stan,7,I wanted my job!,8,Southpark,16,4,,,,,,,,,
65419,Randy,7,"Hey, Stanley, you need to understand something: Those people from the future have had a hard life! Where they come from is dirty and overpopulated and poor! You can't even imagine the kind of depression they come from! So, for us, who have everything sooo good, to judge them, is wrong! Do you understand?! Next time you think about calling them goobacks, you might just wanna stop for a second and think about how crappy the future really is!",8,Southpark,443,79,,,,,,,,,
65421,Stan,7,Timecist?,8,Southpark,9,1,,,,,,,,,
65423,Stan,7,"People from the future. Right, got it.",8,Southpark,38,7,,,,,,,,,
65424,Randy,7,"All right, good. Now, let's all go eat some of Mrs. Gruhd's great future cooking.",8,Southpark,81,15,,,,,,,,,
65441,Kyle,7,What?!,8,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
65444,Kyle,7,"Dude, hold on! This is bullcrap! If they wanna live in our time, then they should learn our language!",8,Southpark,101,19,,,,,,,,,
65446,Stan,7,That's right! ,8,Southpark,14,2,,,,,,,,,
65468,Kyle,7,"Aw, dude. ",8,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,
65470,Stan,7,Can you speak in present-day English please?,8,Southpark,44,7,,,,,,,,,
65472,Stan,7,"Uh yeah, I want a double cheeseburger and fries.",8,Southpark,48,9,,,,,,,,,
65474,Stan,7,"No, a double cheeseburger and fries!",8,Southpark,36,6,,,,,,,,,
65476,Stan,7,What?!,8,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
65478,Cartman,7,"We can't understand you, asshole! ",8,Southpark,34,5,,,,,,,,,
65480,Stan,7,I'm trying to order a double cheeseburger!,8,Southpark,42,7,,,,,,,,,
65482,Stan,7,"No, it's not a chicken sandwich!  I want a Goddamned cheeseburger and some Goddamned fries you fucking goobacks!",8,Southpark,112,18,,,,,,,,,
65483,Randy,7,Stan Marsh!,8,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
65484,Stan,7,Aw- awwww!,8,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,
65497,Stan,7,"Aw, come on, Dad! How come I have to go to work with you?",8,Southpark,57,14,,,,,,,,,
65498,Randy,7,"Because you're being grounded, Stanley! Now I don't wanna hear another word out of your intolerant mouth!  You just sit right there, Stanley, and you thnk about what you've done! ",8,Southpark,179,30,,,,,,,,,
65500,Randy,7,"Hey, Mr. Nelson.",8,Southpark,16,3,,,,,,,,,
65502,Randy,7,Why? This is my office.,8,Southpark,23,5,,,,,,,,,
65504,Randy,7,What?,8,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
65507,Randy,7,You can't be serious.,8,Southpark,21,4,,,,,,,,,
65509,Randy,7,Oh my God. They took my jarb!!,8,Southpark,30,7,,,,,,,,,
65510,Stan,7,They took yer jarb!!,8,Southpark,20,4,,,,,,,,,
65514,Randy,7,"We're doing the only thing we can do. If our government is just gonna let anybody into our time who wants to come, then we have to take matters into our own hands.  We're trying to turn everyone gay so that there are no future humans! Present-day America Number One!",8,Southpark,266,50,,,,,,,,,
65518,Randy,7,"All we can do is try, Harrison.",8,Southpark,31,7,,,,,,,,,
65521,Stan,7,"I I think it's wrong to call them goobacks because they're no different from us.  They're just humans trying to make their lives better. Look, it sucks that the immigrants' time is so crappy, but the cold hard truth is that if we let them all come back to our time, then it's just gonna make our time crappy too. Maybe the answer isn't trying to stop the future from happening, but making the future better. ",8,Southpark,408,76,,,,,,,,,
65523,Stan,7,"I mean, maybe if we all commit right now to working toward a better future, then, then the future won't be so bad, and, these immigrants won't need to come back here looking for work.",8,Southpark,183,35,,,,,,,,,
65526,Randy,7,Well what are we waiting for?,8,Southpark,29,6,,,,,,,,,
65528,Cartman,7,"Look, it's working! ",8,Southpark,20,3,,,,,,,,,
65531,Stan,7,We're doing it!,8,Southpark,15,3,,,,,,,,,
65533,Stan,7,"Dude, wait, wait, ho- hold on. Wait a second.  This is gay.",8,Southpark,59,12,,,,,,,,,
65534,Kyle,7,This is really gay.,8,Southpark,19,4,,,,,,,,,
65535,Cartman,7,"Yeah, this is even gayer than all the men getting in a big pile and having sex with each other.",8,Southpark,95,20,,,,,,,,,
65536,Stan,7,"Okay, sorry, my bad, e-everyone back in the pile. ",8,Southpark,50,9,,,,,,,,,

65573,Kenny,8,,8,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
65574,Cartman,8,"Yeh- no, no, wait, wait. I got a better idea you guys. What we should do is we should secretly go around and tell all the students we can to not check any of the mascots on this election sheet, and instead write in ""Turd Sandwich.""",8,Southpark,231,46,,,,,,,,,
65575,Kyle,8,Turd Sandwich isn't better than Giant Douche.,8,Southpark,45,7,,,,,,,,,
65576,Cartman,8,"Heh, it's only about a thousand times better, am I right guys? Come on! We have to tell everybody fast! This is gonna be so funny!",8,Southpark,130,26,,,,,,,,,
65577,Kyle,8,"It was my idea and we're gonna tell everyone to write in ""Giant Douche!"" It's way funnier!",8,Southpark,90,17,,,,,,,,,
65578,Cartman,8,It is not!,8,Southpark,10,3,,,,,,,,,
65579,Kyle,8,"Kenny, what's funnier? A giant douche or a turd sandwich?",8,Southpark,57,10,,,,,,,,,

65583,Stan,8,"Dude, I really don't care. ",8,Southpark,27,5,,,,,,,,,
65584,Kyle,8,"That's two against one, 'cause Stan doesn't care. So it's giant douche.",8,Southpark,71,12,,,,,,,,,
65585,Cartman,8,"...Wait, wait, what about Butters?",8,Southpark,34,5,,,,,,,,,
65586,Butters,8,Huh?,8,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
65587,Kyle,8,You hate Butters.,8,Southpark,17,3,,,,,,,,,
65588,Cartman,8,"Goddammit, you guys, Butters is our friend! And he's allowed to have his opinion! Butters, which is funnier? A stupid not-funny giant douche or a super funny turd sandwich?",8,Southpark,172,29,,,,,,,,,
65589,Butters,8,"Hahaha, a turd sandwich!",8,Southpark,24,4,,,,,,,,,
65590,Kyle,8,"You misled him, fatass!",8,Southpark,23,4,,,,,,,,,
65591,Cartman,8,"It's the best choice, and me and Butters are sticking with it.",8,Southpark,62,12,,,,,,,,,
65592,Butters,8,Yeah! ...What's this for? ,8,Southpark,26,4,,,,,,,,,
65593,Kyle,8,"Jimmy, we're gonna have everyone write in a mascot that's really funny, and you have to tell us which one would be funnier.",8,Southpark,123,23,,,,,,,,,
65595,Kyle,8,A giant douche.,8,Southpark,15,3,,,,,,,,,

65626,Kyle,8,Giant Douche is your man!,8,Southpark,25,5,,,,,,,,,
65627,Stan,8,"Kyle, aren't you taking this a little too far? I mean, do we really want a giant douche to be our school mascot?",8,Southpark,112,23,,,,,,,,,
65628,Kyle,8,"Dude, I'm not going to lose to Cartman's stupid turd sandwich. ",8,Southpark,63,11,,,,,,,,,
65629,Cartman,8,Vote for Turd Sandwich. This is the most important election of our lives.  Turd Sandwich brings us hope for change. A vote for Turd Sandwich is a Vote for tomorrow!,8,Southpark,164,30,,,,,,,,,

65631,Stan,8,I'm not voting!,8,Southpark,15,3,,,,,,,,,

65633,Stan,8,I just think this whole thing is stupid! ,8,Southpark,41,8,,,,,,,,,
65634,Kyle,8,"Kenny, we have got to make Stan understand the importance of voting, because he'll definitely vote for our guy.",8,Southpark,111,19,,,,,,,,,
65635,Kenny,8,,8,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
65637,Stan,8,It was ridiculous. We have to have a new school mascot and we're supposed to vote between a giant douche and a turd sandwich.,8,Southpark,125,24,,,,,,,,,
65639,Randy,8,Did you just say that... voting is ridiculous?,8,Southpark,46,8,,,,,,,,,
65640,Stan,8,"No, I think voting is great, but, if I have to choose between a douche and a turd, I just don't see the point.",8,Southpark,110,24,,,,,,,,,
65641,Randy,8,"You don't see the point! Oh, you young people just make me sick!",8,Southpark,64,13,,,,,,,,,
65643,Stan,8,"Mom, a-I just don't think there's much of a difference between a douche and a turd. I d-I don't care.",8,Southpark,101,20,,,,,,,,,
65644,Randy,8,You don't care?! You really want a turd sandwich as your school mascot?! On your football helmets?! A turd?!,8,Southpark,108,19,,,,,,,,,
65646,Randy,8,You're crazy!! A d-a douche is at least clean!,8,Southpark,46,9,,,,,,,,,
65648,Randy,8,"You don't understand the issues, Sharon!",8,Southpark,40,6,,,,,,,,,
65650,Randy,8,You think the school mascot should be a turd sandwich? Well you're not exactly Einstein!,8,Southpark,88,15,,,,,,,,,
65653,Stan,8,Puff Daddy?,8,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
65655,Stan,8,I...,8,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
65657,Stan,8,"""Vote or Die""?  What the hell does that even mean?!",8,Southpark,51,10,,,,,,,,,

65673,Cartman,8,"We were just wondering who you might be voting for, for the school's new mascot.",8,Southpark,80,15,,,,,,,,,
65675,Cartman,8,"Oh really? Well, that's interesting. You certainly should think about it and make the right decision.  Butterscotch candy?",8,Southpark,122,18,,,,,,,,,
65677,Cartman,8,"Clyde, are you aware of what Turd Sandwich can bring to our school?",8,Southpark,67,13,,,,,,,,,
65678,Butters,8,"A turd sandwich is not only the first turd to be nominated school mascot, but even the first sandwich. ",8,Southpark,103,19,,,,,,,,,
65679,Cartman,8,"You see, what Turd Sandwich brings to our school, Clyde, is a complete package. The turd and the bread. And the lettuce, and the olives.",8,Southpark,136,25,,,,,,,,,
65680,Butters,8,"Whe-where as Giant Douche is just, well, ju-just a, ju-ju-just a giant douche.",8,Southpark,78,13,,,,,,,,,
65681,Cartman,8,"So, come voting day, you'll now most likely vote for the turd sandwich, yes?",8,Southpark,76,14,,,,,,,,,
65683,Cartman,8,"Well then, perhaps we could interest you in  another butterscotch candy? ",8,Southpark,73,11,,,,,,,,,
65684,Kyle,8,"You're doing the right thing, Stan. Don't you feel like you're a part of something now?",8,Southpark,87,16,,,,,,,,,
65685,Stan,8,I guess... ,8,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
65686,Kyle,8,"Look, it may not seem important now, but your vote really does count, and we all have to do our part.",8,Southpark,101,21,,,,,,,,,
65687,Stan,8,Okay. ,8,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
65688,Kyle,8,"Woah... wait, what are you doing?",8,Southpark,33,6,,,,,,,,,

65691,Stan,8,"Yeah, I know.",8,Southpark,13,3,,,,,,,,,
65692,Kyle,8,"...Dude, you're supposed to vote for Giant Douche.",8,Southpark,50,8,,,,,,,,,
65693,Stan,8,I thought I was supposed to make my own decision.,8,Southpark,49,10,,,,,,,,,
65694,Kyle,8,"Well yeah, but not if your decision is for Turd Sandwich! What the hell is wrong with you?!",8,Southpark,91,18,,,,,,,,,
65695,Stan,8,"Wait a minute, you didn't want me to vote, you wanted me to vote for your guy!",8,Southpark,78,17,,,,,,,,,
65696,Kyle,8,"Well, I just figured you'd vote for my guy! Who's fuckin' friend are you?!  Puffy!",8,Southpark,82,15,,,,,,,,,
65697,Cartman,8,"Hey, fuck off, Kyle.  Don't let them intimidate you, Stan. I'll help walk you to the booth. And then I'm gonna buy you a nice steak dinner with all the trimmings.",8,Southpark,162,31,,,,,,,,,
65698,Stan,8,"Oh, forget it! I'm not gonna be persuaded into voting and I'm and I'm not gonna be threatened into voting if I don't feel comfortable with it! I'm not gonna vote and you can all just live with it!",8,Southpark,196,39,,,,,,,,,
65700,Randy,8,"Stanley, when you left for school this morning, you said you were going to vote!",8,Southpark,80,15,,,,,,,,,
65701,Stan,8,The whole thing is a joke!,8,Southpark,26,6,,,,,,,,,
65704,Randy,8,"Oh! Are you happy now, Stan? You just got yourself suspended!",8,Southpark,61,11,,,,,,,,,
65706,Randy,8,Expulsion?!,8,Southpark,11,1,,,,,,,,,

65712,Stan,8,"You-you're all joking, right?",8,Southpark,29,4,,,,,,,,,
65714,Kyle,8,"Stan, don't you think this has gone far enough? Is it really that big a deal?  Yeah, just vote. For Giant Douche.",8,Southpark,113,22,,,,,,,,,
65715,Stan,8,I'm not voting! ,8,Southpark,16,3,,,,,,,,,
65718,Randy,8,"This is breaking your mother's heart, Stan. She couldn't even help tie you to the horse.",8,Southpark,88,16,,,,,,,,,
65719,Stan,8,"Dad, isn't this a little extreme?",8,Southpark,33,6,,,,,,,,,
65720,Randy,8,"Jesus. I guess maybe you'll never understand how important voting is.  Goodbye, Son.  That's... one of the hardest things a parent ever has to do.",8,Southpark,146,25,,,,,,,,,
65723,Stan,8,Hello? ,8,Southpark,7,1,,,,,,,,,
65726,Stan,8,"Oh, thank God.",8,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,
65731,Stan,8,Awww!,8,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
65734,Stan,8,What about me?,8,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,
65739,Stan,8,I was put on the horse. I didn't wanna ride it.,8,Southpark,47,11,,,,,,,,,
65741,Stan,8,"Wow, you guys really love animals.",8,Southpark,34,6,,,,,,,,,
65745,Stan,8,I'll live with you.,8,Southpark,19,4,,,,,,,,,
65747,Stan,8,He said I can stay.,8,Southpark,19,5,,,,,,,,,
65752,Cartman,8,"Aww, suck-up, suck-up!  What?! That's an obvious suck-up move.",8,Southpark,62,9,,,,,,,,,
65767,Stan,8,"Ahh, no thanks, that's okay.",8,Southpark,28,5,,,,,,,,,
65769,Stan,8,"I do love animals, just ...not like you guys do.",8,Southpark,48,10,,,,,,,,,
65771,Stan,8,I can't. I was banished for not voting.,8,Southpark,39,8,,,,,,,,,
65773,Stan,8,I think voting is great. I just didn't care this time because it was between a giant douche and a turd sandwich.,8,Southpark,112,22,,,,,,,,,
65775,Stan,8,I guess... I guess you're right. ,8,Southpark,33,6,,,,,,,,,
65777,Stan,8,Aaah!,8,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,

65791,Randy,8,Stan!,8,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
65793,Stan,8,I learned that I'd better get used to having to pick between a douche and a turd sandwich because it's usually the choice I'll have.,8,Southpark,132,25,,,,,,,,,
65794,Randy,8,He's going to vote!,8,Southpark,19,4,,,,,,,,,
65800,Stan,8,"Dude, so my vote didn't even really matter!",8,Southpark,43,8,,,,,,,,,
65801,Randy,8,"Hey! That's not true, Stan.",8,Southpark,27,5,,,,,,,,,

66339,Stan,11,"Eric, it looks as though the school will be serving a chicken cutlet. Now, that's traditionally a uh-a white meat chicken... breast, if you will, that has been breaded, and then cooked. I've been told there will also be tater-tots and a vegetable dish. This is really shaping up to be a ah-ah one fantastic lunch. Eric?",8,Southpark,319,57,,,,,,,,,

66422,Cartman,11,"You see Token, people really enjoy seeing African-Americans on the news... Seeing African-Americans on the news, not hearing them. That's why all African-Americans newspeople learn to talk more... wha, how should I say... white.  Token, all the great African-Americans newspeople have learned to hide their ebonic tribespeak with a more pure Caucasian dialect. There's no shame in it, and I think it'll really help our ratings.",8,Southpark,427,66,,,,,,,,,

67374,Mr. Garrison,1,My whole life I've been a woman trapped in a man's body. A sex-change operation is my last chance at happiness.,9,Southpark,111,21,,,,,,,,,

67413,Cartman,1,"You guys, Mr. Garrison has titties.",9,Southpark,35,6,,,,,,,,,
67415,Kyle,1,Mom? Dad? What's a sex-change operation?,9,Southpark,40,6,,,,,,,,,
67417,Kyle,1,"But our teacher, Mr. Garrison? He just had his penis made into a vagina. How come?",9,Southpark,82,16,,,,,,,,,
67425,Kyle,1,Yeah. That's right.,9,Southpark,19,3,,,,,,,,,
67427,Kyle,1,Totally! I totally understand!,9,Southpark,30,4,,,,,,,,,
67430,Kyle,1,"Yeah. My school teacher wanted to be a woman, and you made him into one.",9,Southpark,72,15,,,,,,,,,
67432,Kyle,1,"Well, do you also do other surgeries like that?",9,Southpark,47,9,,,,,,,,,
67434,Kyle,1,"No, no, uh I wanna be tall and black.",9,Southpark,37,9,,,,,,,,,
67436,Kyle,1,I hate being small and Jewish. I feel like a tall black man.,9,Southpark,60,13,,,,,,,,,
67438,Kyle,1,Yeah! ,9,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
67439,Stan,1,Wha-a-a negroplasty??,9,Southpark,21,2,,,,,,,,,
67441,Stan,1,"Uh excuse me, is this really a good idea?",9,Southpark,41,9,,,,,,,,,
67456,Kyle,1,Mom! Dad! I have awesome news! The doctor who gave Mr. Garrison his sex change said he can make me tall and black. ,9,Southpark,115,23,,,,,,,,,
67458,Kyle,1,Dr. Biber said he can give me a negroplasty so I can finally look the way I've always wanted. He even took my picture and then did computer imaging to show what I would look like after the surgery. ,9,Southpark,198,39,,,,,,,,,
67460,Kyle,1,"Can I have three thousand dollars, Mom and Dad, huh?? Can I??",9,Southpark,61,12,,,,,,,,,
67462,Kyle,1,But why not? You said sometimes people need surgery to make them feel better about themselves.,9,Southpark,94,16,,,,,,,,,
67464,Kyle,1,"Well, all my life I felt I was black! I've listened to hip-hop, I watch UPN and I love playing basketball! My body doesn't reflect who I am inside.",9,Southpark,147,29,,,,,,,,,
67466,Kyle,1,Why? Why do I have to accept it when I can change it?,9,Southpark,53,13,,,,,,,,,
67468,Kyle,1,But Jews can't play basketball! ,9,Southpark,32,5,,,,,,,,,
67470,Kyle,1,I'm never speaking to either of you ever again! ,9,Southpark,48,9,,,,,,,,,
67503,Butters,1,"Fellas! Hey fellas, you gotta come see!",9,Southpark,39,7,,,,,,,,,
67504,Stan,1,What?,9,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
67505,Butters,1,"Uhh, it's Kyle! Huh, he's a Negro! ",9,Southpark,35,7,,,,,,,,,
67509,Kyle,1,"Yeah, but it was totally worth it. ",9,Southpark,35,7,,,,,,,,,
67510,Stan,1,"Jesus Christ, dude!",9,Southpark,19,3,,,,,,,,,
67511,Kyle,1,"Look, Stan, I'm finally whole! My dad is even gonna take me back down to the all-star game to see if I can try out for the team again!",9,Southpark,134,29,,,,,,,,,
67513,Kyle,1,"Alright, Dad! ",9,Southpark,14,2,,,,,,,,,
67514,Stan,1,"Dude, is Kyle's- dad a- dolphin?",9,Southpark,32,6,,,,,,,,,

67547,Kyle,1,"Coach! Coach, I'm all better. I'm ready to play.",9,Southpark,48,9,,,,,,,,,
67549,Kyle,1,"Ih it's me, Kyle Broflovski. I had a negroplasty. Can I play in the All-State team now?",9,Southpark,87,17,,,,,,,,,
67551,Kyle,1,"All right!  Dad, I can play! ",9,Southpark,29,6,,,,,,,,,
67554,Stan,1,"Kyle went down to play in the basketball game, Mrs. Garrison.",9,Southpark,61,11,,,,,,,,,
67558,Stan,1,What?! But you made him into a basketball player.,9,Southpark,49,9,,,,,,,,,
67563,Kyle,1,"I'm a hundred percent ready, coach! ",9,Southpark,36,6,,,,,,,,,
67578,Kyle,1,All right!  Ow. Hm. ,9,Southpark,20,4,,,,,,,,,

67597,Stan,1,"Yeah, that's basically it.",9,Southpark,26,4,,,,,,,,,
67602,Kyle,1,But what about Mr. Garrison? He can't go back.,9,Southpark,46,9,,,,,,,,,
67604,Cartman,2,"Hello, ma'am. I'm working to clean up the neighborhood from parasites. Do you mind if I take a quick look around your house? I'm afraid you may have hippies.",9,Southpark,157,29,,,,,,,,,
67606,Cartman,2,"Yeah, they've been poppin' up all over the neighborhood lately. Ms. Nelson next door had seven hippies in her basement; they usually live in colonies.  Hm, I don't like the sound of that. Could I take a look in your attic?",9,Southpark,222,41,,,,,,,,,
67607,Cartman,2,"Oh yeah, boy. Take a look at this, ma'am.  See that? Hippies. ",9,Southpark,62,12,,,,,,,,,
67609,Cartman,2,"These are what we call the uh giggling stoners. Pretty common form of hippie, usually found in the attics. Problem is, if you see one hippie, there's probably a whole lot more you're not seein'. Uh, whe-where's the backyard.",9,Southpark,224,39,,,,,,,,,
67610,Cartman,2,"Yep, that's what I thought. See that? You've got a drum circle in your backyard. ",9,Southpark,81,15,,,,,,,,,
67612,Cartman,2,"Yeah. You know, I had a guy in Jackson County. He had a little drum circle in his backyard. It turned into a drum circle four miles in diameter. You get a few hippies playing drums and next thing you know, you got yourself a colony.",9,Southpark,232,46,,,,,,,,,
67615,Cartman,2,"Well, your attic could be so we can fumigate with polymarethane. The drum circle we're gonna have to gas.  God dammit! ",9,Southpark,119,21,,,,,,,,,
67617,Cartman,2,God damn hippie! ,9,Southpark,17,3,,,,,,,,,
67619,Cartman,2,Get out of here!,9,Southpark,16,4,,,,,,,,,
67621,Cartman,2,"Ma'am, I need to clear out your giggling stoners and your drum-circle hippies RIGHT NOW, or soon they're gonna attract something much worse!",9,Southpark,140,23,,,,,,,,,
67623,Cartman,2,The college know-it-all hippies.,9,Southpark,32,4,,,,,,,,,
67626,Kyle,2,"Hey, let's ask them. ",9,Southpark,21,4,,,,,,,,,
67627,Stan,2,"All right.  'Scuse me.  Hello, we are selling magazine subscriptions for our community youth program. Would you like to help young people like us by purchasing a subscription of your choice?",9,Southpark,190,31,,,,,,,,,
67629,Kyle,2,Wha- whataya mean?,9,Southpark,18,3,,,,,,,,,
67631,Stan,2,Who are the corporations?,9,Southpark,25,4,,,,,,,,,
67633,Stan,2,Are you serious? We never heard that.,9,Southpark,37,7,,,,,,,,,
67635,Kyle,2,Ugh! Those dirty liars!,9,Southpark,23,4,,,,,,,,,
67636,Kenny,2, ,9,Southpark,1,0,,,,,,,,,
67638,Stan,2,Well... Well what do we do?,9,Southpark,27,6,,,,,,,,,
67641,Cartman,2,"All right, in you go.",9,Southpark,21,5,,,,,,,,,
67644,Cartman,2,Get back. Get back or you're all gonna get maced! ,9,Southpark,50,10,,,,,,,,,
67647,Cartman,2,What's wrong is that there's more of you showing up every day and I need to find out why!,9,Southpark,89,19,,,,,,,,,
67650,Cartman,2,"Brah, I'm not gonna argue with you, all right? Just go with it.",9,Southpark,63,13,,,,,,,,,
67652,Cartman,2,"And you're gonna be here a little longer, brah, all right? Here, here's some joints , and a guitar! ",9,Southpark,100,19,,,,,,,,,
67654,Stan,2,"Sign, sign everywhere. SignDone something to my mind.",9,Southpark,53,8,,,,,,,,,
67656,Stan,2,"Mom, the mall is a way for the corporate fat cats to imprison you into a life of servitude. I've got some stuff you should read.",9,Southpark,128,26,,,,,,,,,
67659,Chef,2,"Mayor, we have got to do somethin' about all these potholes on our roads!",9,Southpark,73,14,,,,,,,,,
67662,Chef,2,We- ,9,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
67664,Cartman,2,"Please, I have to talk to you all right now!",9,Southpark,44,10,,,,,,,,,
67666,Cartman,2,"Mayor, something very big is happening, and if you all don't give me a moment of your time, there may be no more South Park to council over!",9,Southpark,140,28,,,,,,,,,
67667,Randy,2,What are you talking about?,9,Southpark,27,5,,,,,,,,,
67668,Cartman,2,"I'm talking about the end of all life as we know it.  For the past several days I've been... noticing a steep rise in the number of hippies coming to town.  At first I thought maybe it was just a coincidence.  Then I saw this...  Three new drum circles have sprouted up here, here, and here. They're all growing in diameter, at a rate of two hippies per hour. What this means... is that the hippies are conglomerating. They're thriving, if you will. I think that they're setting up for a... . hippie music festival.",9,Southpark,515,95,,,,,,,,,
67670,Cartman,2,"It's, it's simple science. Look: When hippies start to nest in a new area, it draws other hippies in. With the right weather conditions and topography, it can lead to a music festival. One that last for days, even weeks. Reggae on the River, Woodstock, Burning Man, they will all pale in comparison to what we're looking at now. In my professional opinion... I think we're looking at a full-blown hippie jam festival the size of which we've never seen. ",9,Southpark,453,80,,,,,,,,,
67672,Cartman,2,"I know hippies. I've hated them all my life. I've kept this town free of hippies on my own since I was five and a half. But I can't contain them on my own anymore. We have to do something, fast!",9,Southpark,194,41,,,,,,,,,
67674,Cartman,2,It's not potholes you need to worry about. It's potheads. I know what these people are capable of. ',9,Southpark,100,19,,,,,,,,,
67676,Cartman,2,What are you doing?!  You have to listen to me! You can't sweep this problem under the rug!  The town is in serious danger! ,9,Southpark,124,24,,,,,,,,,
67678,Stan,2,"Right, so how do we get back at them?",9,Southpark,37,9,,,,,,,,,
67679,Kyle,2,"Yeah, we're pissed off.",9,Southpark,23,4,,,,,,,,,
67681,Cartman,2,"I knew you were trying to have a hippie jam festival! All right, everyone pack up your crap, we're going to our basement!",9,Southpark,121,23,,,,,,,,,
67682,Kyle,2,"Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!",9,Southpark,38,7,,,,,,,,,
67683,Cartman,2,"Oh Jesus, not you guys?  What happened? Were you bit? Did you eat their brownies? DID YOU EAT THEIR BROWNIES?!",9,Southpark,110,20,,,,,,,,,
67684,Stan,2,NO!,9,Southpark,3,1,,,,,,,,,

67689,Cartman,2,Everybody get in a single-file line!,9,Southpark,36,6,,,,,,,,,
67691,Cartman,2,"Ah, Officer Barbrady, you're just in time. These college know-it-all hippies were setting up for a music festival, just as I predicted.",9,Southpark,135,22,,,,,,,,,
67693,Cartman,2,What?,9,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
67695,Cartman,2,"You let them out?! Jesus, we have to find them!",9,Southpark,47,10,,,,,,,,,
67697,Cartman,2,"No! No, we have to stop them! You know how we-?! We gotta stop them! Hebbiaaay! ",9,Southpark,80,16,,,,,,,,,
67699,Cartman,2,What did I do?!,9,Southpark,15,4,,,,,,,,,
67701,Cartman,2,"They're not people, they're HIPPIES!",9,Southpark,36,5,,,,,,,,,
67704,Cartman,2,"Mayor! Mayor, I confirmed the data! The hippies are going to have a massive jam band concert!",9,Southpark,93,17,,,,,,,,,
67706,Cartman,2,You... You what?,9,Southpark,16,3,,,,,,,,,
67708,Cartman,2,They're hippies! They don't HAVE any money! Does the city council know about this?!,9,Southpark,83,14,,,,,,,,,
67710,Cartman,2,You just SOLD OUT OUR TOWN! ,9,Southpark,28,6,,,,,,,,,
67714,Cartman,2,"How much money is enough, Mayor?! How many people's lives it is all worth?! God damned hippy!",9,Southpark,93,17,,,,,,,,,
67718,Stan,2,Yeah!,9,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
67719,Kyle,2,You said it!,9,Southpark,12,3,,,,,,,,,
67722,Randy,2,"Sharon, have, have you seen Stan?",9,Southpark,33,6,,,,,,,,,
67724,Randy,2,"Oh, Jesus, what has gotten into that kid?!",9,Southpark,42,8,,,,,,,,,
67726,Randy,2,"Yeah, but when we did it we actually stood for something. I mean, remember Woodstock, Sharon? We actually did something there.",9,Southpark,126,21,,,,,,,,,
67729,Randy,2,S-stan. STAAAN!,9,Southpark,15,2,,,,,,,,,
67734,Randy,2,"Stan?! Stan?! I need to get through, please! ",9,Southpark,45,8,,,,,,,,,
67736,Randy,2,My son is in there! Duh-uh!  Stan?!  Stan! Stan!,9,Southpark,48,9,,,,,,,,,
67739,Randy,2,Sta-ogh. Ugh! ,9,Southpark,14,2,,,,,,,,,
67743,Cartman,2,"Great, I love crapping in a toilet with no rim on it.",9,Southpark,53,12,,,,,,,,,
67744,Randy,2,"Eric, you were right. About the hippies. Could you... get rid of them for us now?",9,Southpark,81,16,,,,,,,,,
67745,Cartman,2,Let me guess: they've started a hippie jam band music festival.,9,Southpark,63,11,,,,,,,,,
67747,Cartman,2,Forget it. ,9,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
67748,Randy,2,Please. Some of our kids are in there. We should have listened to you earlier.,9,Southpark,78,15,,,,,,,,,
67749,Chef,2,Yeah. We apologize.,9,Southpark,19,3,,,,,,,,,
67751,Cartman,2,"It's too late! Even if I did agree to help, there's too many of them now!",9,Southpark,73,16,,,,,,,,,
67753,Randy,2,"We're just asking you to try. The whole town even got together and, and baked you a cake. ",9,Southpark,90,18,,,,,,,,,
67754,Cartman,2,Don't think that you can buy me with presents! ...Unless of course it's the new Tonka radio-controlled play bulldozer.,9,Southpark,118,19,,,,,,,,,
67755,Randy,2,It's yours.,9,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
67756,Cartman,2,I want the batteries for it too. And I get to drive it around in the school parking lot.,9,Southpark,88,19,,,,,,,,,
67759,Cartman,2,Yes.  Kyle doesn't get to have one! Ever! And he has to watch me drive mine around the school parking lot and get super-jealous!,9,Southpark,128,24,,,,,,,,,
67761,Cartman,2,"All right, fine. But now listen up and listen good! I've never tried to get rid of this many hippies before, so I'm gonna need every resource this town has! And even if I don't succeed, and it's a million-to-one shot that I will, I still get the Tonka radio-controlled bulldozer and get to play with it in the school parking lot where Kyle has to watch me and get super-jealous because he doesn't have one! Are we clear?! ",9,Southpark,422,79,,,,,,,,,
67763,Stan,2,So it seems like we have enough people now. When do we start taking down the corporations?,9,Southpark,90,17,,,,,,,,,
67765,Kyle,2,"Yeah, so, where are they. Let's go get 'em.",9,Southpark,43,9,,,,,,,,,
67768,Stan,2,You mean like a baker and a cop?,9,Southpark,32,8,,,,,,,,,
67770,Kyle,2,"Yeah, it's called a town.",9,Southpark,25,5,,,,,,,,,
67772,Cartman,2,"All right, everyone listen up! The hippie jam band festival is now fourteen miles in diameter and five hundred thousand hippies thick.",9,Southpark,134,22,,,,,,,,,
67773,Randy,2,My God...,9,Southpark,9,2,,,,,,,,,
67774,Cartman,2,"In less than three days, all of South Park will be completely consumed. My only hope is to fight our way to the center of the crowd, and reach the heart, here.  If we can reach the stage, we can upload this Slayer CD into their music system.  Hippies can't stand death metal. If everything works, they should disperse just before they consume us all.",9,Southpark,350,65,,,,,,,,,
67776,Cartman,2,We drill.  I've designed a vehicle that can bore its way through even the densest hippie crowd. They pilots inside will be safe from the pot smoke and the crappy music outside.,9,Southpark,176,32,,,,,,,,,
67778,Cartman,2,"Not just somebody. I need a complete team to operate this vehicle. Along with me I'm gonna need a scientist, an engineer, and of course, a black person who can sacrifice himself in case something goes wrong.",9,Southpark,207,37,,,,,,,,,
67779,Randy,2,I'm the... only scientist in town.,9,Southpark,34,6,,,,,,,,,
67783,Cartman,2,"All right, then we just need a black person who can sacrifice himself in case something goes wrong.  Lessee, anyone would do, anyone who meets the qualifications, let's see...  Oh, I know. How about- ",9,Southpark,200,34,,,,,,,,,
67784,Chef,2,"Yeah, yeah! I get it! Fine!",9,Southpark,27,6,,,,,,,,,
67786,Randy,2,"You got a better ides, Steven?! Dammit, my son is in there!",9,Southpark,59,12,,,,,,,,,
67787,Cartman,2,"There's no more time for ideas! We have to have this vehicle up and operational in less than three days! Look, it's a long shot! But it's also the only shot we-  got.",9,Southpark,166,33,,,,,,,,,
67792,Butters,2,"Ah I will, Mom.",9,Southpark,15,4,,,,,,,,,
67793,Chef,2,"Now, now, don't cry, ladies. Everything's gonna be fine.",9,Southpark,56,9,,,,,,,,,
67794,Cartman,2,"I... don't want you to worry about me, Clyde Frog.  Hey! You're the best stuffed animal I've ever had. ",9,Southpark,103,19,,,,,,,,,
67797,Cartman,2,Primary engine running?,9,Southpark,23,3,,,,,,,,,
67798,Randy,2,Check.,9,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
67799,Cartman,2,Navigation systems?,9,Southpark,19,2,,,,,,,,,
67801,Cartman,2,Let's punch this baby.  We're coming up on the outer perimeter of the hippies. Hang on.  Reaching hippie crowd. Hull status?,9,Southpark,124,21,,,,,,,,,
67802,Randy,2,Vehicle shell holding! ,9,Southpark,23,3,,,,,,,,,
67806,Stan,2,"Alright, I can't take it anymore! I'm getting on that stage!",9,Southpark,60,11,,,,,,,,,
67807,Kyle,2,You're doing what?,9,Southpark,18,3,,,,,,,,,
67809,Cartman,2,Switching to secondary fuel line.  What's that?,9,Southpark,47,7,,,,,,,,,
67810,Randy,2,The drill is getting too hot from all the hippies. ,9,Southpark,51,10,,,,,,,,,
67814,Stan,2,"Uh, excuse me. Excuse me, can I have your attention please? What are we doing?  It's been nine days! Doesn't it seem like we should accomplish something?",9,Southpark,153,27,,,,,,,,,
67816,Stan,2,"Maybe instead of complaining about corporations being selfish, we should look at ourselves. I mean, is there anything more selfish than doing nothing but getting high and listening to music all day long?",9,Southpark,203,33,,,,,,,,,
67818,Cartman,2,"Come on, come on!",9,Southpark,17,4,,,,,,,,,
67820,Randy,2,Somebody's gonna have to go outside and activate the backup boosters.,9,Southpark,69,11,,,,,,,,,
67821,Cartman,2,"No, Chef, I'm not gonna let you go out there!",9,Southpark,45,10,,,,,,,,,
67822,Chef,2,...I didn't volunteer!,9,Southpark,22,3,,,,,,,,,
67823,Cartman,2,"...All right, fine Chef, go!",9,Southpark,28,5,,,,,,,,,
67824,Chef,2,...Aw dammit! ,9,Southpark,14,2,,,,,,,,,
67827,Stan,2,"Dude, these people have no idea what's going on. Let's get out of here.",9,Southpark,71,14,,,,,,,,,
67828,Kyle,2,We can't. Kenny just checked. There's a wall of people like seven miles thick behind us.,9,Southpark,88,16,,,,,,,,,
67829,Stan,2,"What? You mean, we're stuck here listening to this crap? ",9,Southpark,57,10,,,,,,,,,
67833,Cartman,2,Hit the PA system NOW!  Put me in the main line! ,9,Southpark,49,11,,,,,,,,,
67834,Randy,2,Which cord is it?,9,Southpark,17,4,,,,,,,,,
67835,Cartman,2,"You're the scientist, jackass!",9,Southpark,30,4,,,,,,,,,
67836,Randy,2,I'm a geologist!,9,Southpark,16,3,,,,,,,,,
67838,Randy,2,Nyugh!,9,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,

67852,Kyle,2,"Whoa, Cartman. We aren't gonna be hippies anymore. Y-you don't have to kill us.",9,Southpark,79,14,,,,,,,,,
67853,Cartman,2,Kill you? Oh no. I have much bigger plans for you now.,9,Southpark,54,12,,,,,,,,,
67854,Cartman,2,"Hoho! Aw man, this is awesome! Weeeee!  Oh here, Kyle, you wanna play with it a little while.  Oh, psych! You don't get to! Hehe. Oh, check it out! Cooool!",9,Southpark,155,30,,,,,,,,,
67856,Stan,3,Token sings?,9,Southpark,12,2,,,,,,,,,
67857,Cartman,3,Of course he sings. He's black.,9,Southpark,31,6,,,,,,,,,
67860,Stan,3,Two hundred dollars.,9,Southpark,20,3,,,,,,,,,
67862,Stan,3,"Wow, two hundred dollars. Can you imagine?",9,Southpark,42,7,,,,,,,,,
67863,Kyle,3,How come we never get opportunities like that?,9,Southpark,46,8,,,,,,,,,
67864,Cartman,3,"You wanna know what it is, guys?",9,Southpark,32,7,,,,,,,,,
67865,Kyle,3,We're not talented?,9,Southpark,19,3,,,,,,,,,
67866,Cartman,3,"That's right. We're not talented. See, we're not the artistic side, we're the thinking side.",9,Southpark,92,15,,,,,,,,,
67867,Stan,3,Yeah. We're too smart to be talented.,9,Southpark,37,7,,,,,,,,,
67868,Cartman,3,"Wait, you guys! I just had an amazing idea. Token is going right to the top, right. I mean, he's gonna be a huge star.",9,Southpark,118,25,,,,,,,,,
67869,Kyle,3,Probably.,9,Southpark,9,1,,,,,,,,,
67870,Cartman,3,"So, why shouldn't we get some of that money? We can be Token's agents. That way, we get ten percent of whatever he makes!",9,Southpark,121,24,,,,,,,,,
67871,Stan,3,Hey yeah! We deserve that money just as much as he does.,9,Southpark,56,12,,,,,,,,,
67872,Cartman,3,"We just need a really kickass office and some nice suits. A and a fountain in our lobby. All top agencies have fountains in their lobbies. We gotta make Token think he needs us, when actually he doesn't need us at all. ",9,Southpark,219,42,,,,,,,,,
67873,Stan,3,He's looking at the sign.,9,Southpark,25,5,,,,,,,,,
67874,Cartman,3,"Perfect! All right, you guys get back to the office, I'll bring Token there.",9,Southpark,76,14,,,,,,,,,
67875,Stan,3,All right.,9,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,
67876,Cartman,3,"Wait a minute! You guys, this is very important: when I bring Token back to the office, have Kenny hide in another room, and call the phone on my desk.",9,Southpark,151,30,,,,,,,,,
67877,Kyle,3,Why?,9,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
67878,Cartman,3,"Because I'll answer and pretend I'm talking to somebody super famous and important. When Token sees that, maybe he'll think we're legit.",9,Southpark,136,22,,,,,,,,,
67879,Stan,3,It's genius.,9,Southpark,12,2,,,,,,,,,
67880,Cartman,3,"Okay, go go, here he comes.  Yeah? Well then tell him we're just not interested.  Oh hey, Token! Buddy, my man, what is up?!",9,Southpark,124,24,,,,,,,,,
67882,Cartman,3,"Hey, you know, I heard you were doing some thing down in Denver tomorrow night.",9,Southpark,79,15,,,,,,,,,
67884,Cartman,3,"Yeah I don't know if I ever told you this before, but I'm actually an agent over at the Super Awesome Talent Agency. You may have seen our ads around town. Anyway, why don't you come down to the office, Token? Maybe I can convince the company to represent you.",9,Southpark,260,50,,,,,,,,,
67886,Cartman,3,This will only take a second.,9,Southpark,29,6,,,,,,,,,
67887,Cartman,3,"Welcome to our offices, Token. As you can see, we are quite a successful company. Did you notice the fountain? Pretty nice, hm?  Come on over this way, Token.  Guys, you remember Token. He's thinking about becoming a client.",9,Southpark,224,39,,,,,,,,,
67888,Stan,3,"Ohhhh Token. Right, yeah, you're makin' a smart move, man.",9,Southpark,58,10,,,,,,,,,
67889,Cartman,3,"Now, Token, I I know what you're saying to yourself: You're saying, ""Hey, why do I need an agency? Why should I give them ten percent?"" Right?",9,Southpark,142,27,,,,,,,,,
67891,Cartman,3,"Token, the truth is that without representation, you're in danger of being taken advantage of.  Uh uh, excuse me just a second, Token.  Super Awesome Talent Agency. Oh yes, hello! How are you, Abraham Lincoln?  Yeah, yeah, no, I'm happy you called, Abraham Lincoln. I'm just sort of in the middle of something right now.",9,Southpark,320,55,,,,,,,,,
67892,Kyle,3,Can I talk to you?! ,9,Southpark,20,5,,,,,,,,,
67893,Cartman,3,"I'll I'll call you back, Abe. ",9,Southpark,30,6,,,,,,,,,
67894,Kyle,3,What the hell are you doing?!,9,Southpark,29,6,,,,,,,,,

67897,Cartman,3,...well Token doesn't know that.,9,Southpark,32,5,,,,,,,,,
67898,Kyle,3,Yes he does!,9,Southpark,12,3,,,,,,,,,
67899,Cartman,3,How?!,9,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
67900,Kyle,3,"Token actually pays attention in school! Unlike you, fatass!",9,Southpark,60,9,,,,,,,,,
67901,Cartman,3,Jew! ,9,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
67902,Stan,3,"You guys, we're gonna lose our client. ",9,Southpark,39,7,,,,,,,,,
67903,Cartman,3,"Yes, yes, I think that's a good idea, guys. Let's give Michael Jordan a call about that.  Ah, now, where were we?",9,Southpark,113,22,,,,,,,,,
67905,Stan,3,"Look, Token, here's the bottom line. You're gonna start having a lot of offers comin' at you from all directions. A media storm is about to hit you and you can't handle it on your own. Nobody can.",9,Southpark,196,38,,,,,,,,,
67906,Kyle,3,"Eminem, Justin Timberlake, Hootie... They all have agents. You need somebody to manage it all for you.",9,Southpark,102,17,,,,,,,,,
67907,Stan,3,"This thing in Denver is is just the crust, Token. With our support, you can have the whole pie.",9,Southpark,95,19,,,,,,,,,
67909,Cartman,3,Uh if... we could just get you to sign right here? ,9,Southpark,51,11,,,,,,,,,
67910,Kyle,3,"Welcome to the team, Token.",9,Southpark,27,5,,,,,,,,,

67917,Stan,3,"Oh, you're interested in hiring our client?",9,Southpark,43,7,,,,,,,,,
67918,Cartman,3,"We represent Token.  Give us a call, we'll work out a deal.",9,Southpark,59,12,,,,,,,,,
67923,Stan,3,"You were awesome, Token!",9,Southpark,24,4,,,,,,,,,
67924,Kyle,3,We knew you could do it!,9,Southpark,24,6,,,,,,,,,
67925,Cartman,3,"Two hundred dollars, Token, that's great! And ten percent of two hundred is...",9,Southpark,78,13,,,,,,,,,
67926,Kyle,3,Twenty dollars.,9,Southpark,15,2,,,,,,,,,
67928,Kenny,3,,9,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
67929,Cartman,3,Sweet!,9,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
67930,Stan,3,This is just the beginning. I bet we start to see all kinds of offers comin' in for Token now.,9,Southpark,94,20,,,,,,,,,
67935,Stan,3,"Uh excuse me, Token already has representation.",9,Southpark,47,7,,,,,,,,,
67936,Cartman,3,You may have heard of Super Awesome Talent Agency.,9,Southpark,50,9,,,,,,,,,
67939,Cartman,3,"Token, you signed with us!",9,Southpark,26,5,,,,,,,,,

67949,Kyle,3,All that time and effort we spent helping Token and this is the thanks we get?!,9,Southpark,79,16,,,,,,,,,

68975,Butters,7,Well sure I do.,9,Southpark,15,4,,,,,,,,,
68977,Butters,7,"Yes, now sit down, Jimmy, we should have a little talk.  You see, Jimmy, when a man's penis becomes hard, the man puts it into a lady. Into her ""vagiiina.""

69374,Cartman,8,...Aw man.,9,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,
69377,Stan,8,No. I broke the dam.,9,Southpark,20,5,,,,,,,,,
69381,Stan,8,No. I broke the dam.,9,Southpark,20,5,,,,,,,,,
69384,Cartman,8,"Hehe, I broke the dam. Hehe.",9,Southpark,28,6,,,,,,,,,
69387,Stan,8,I broke the dam. I ran a boat into the dam and I broke it.,9,Southpark,58,15,,,,,,,,,
69392,Stan,8,No! I broke the fucking dam!,9,Southpark,28,6,,,,,,,,,
69395,Stan,8,I literally broke the dam!,9,Southpark,26,5,,,,,,,,,
69398,Stan,8,On a boat! That wasn't mine!,9,Southpark,28,6,,,,,,,,,
69401,Stan,8,"I kept it secret, for two days!",9,Southpark,31,7,,,,,,,,,
69404,Stan,8,"The boat caught on fire, and it exploded!",9,Southpark,41,8,,,,,,,,,
69407,Stan,8,"Ohhh, fuck it!",9,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,
69408,Kyle,9,What are all you guys doing here?,9,Southpark,33,7,,,,,,,,,
69410,Stan,9,"Yeah, us too.",9,Southpark,13,3,,,,,,,,,
69411,Cartman,9,"Ah, gentlemen, thank you for coming. We don't have a lot of time, so I'll cut to the chase. The girls at our school have been hiding something from us, hiding something huge.",9,Southpark,174,33,,,,,,,,,
69413,Cartman,9,"What if I were to tell you that the girls have a device, which allows them to see... into the future.",9,Southpark,101,21,,,,,,,,,
69414,Stan,9,What?,9,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
69415,Butters,9,How do you know?,9,Southpark,16,4,,,,,,,,,
69416,Kyle,9,The girls do not have a device that shows them the future Cartman. That's retarded.,9,Southpark,83,15,,,,,,,,,
69418,Cartman,9,"Thank you, Clyde. Uh, I'm afraid it's true.  I secretly videotaped the girls in the playground yesterday using my Wellington Bear video camera . I caught the following images on tape. I warn you, this images maybe be too shocking for young children.",9,Southpark,249,43,,,,,,,,,
69419,Butters,9,Okay. I'm not lookin'. ,9,Southpark,23,4,,,,,,,,,
69420,Cartman,9,Video playback initialized. ,9,Southpark,28,3,,,,,,,,,
69443,Stan,9,"Oh my God, how does it know the answer?",9,Southpark,39,9,,,,,,,,,
69445,Cartman,9,"Believe it. The girls can ask any question they want and it gives the answer. Freeze image!  Gentlemen, we have to get our hands on that device.",9,Southpark,144,27,,,,,,,,,
69446,Cartman,9,How is the incubation shield coming Clyde?,9,Southpark,42,7,,,,,,,,,
69448,Cartman,9,Good man. Any luck here?,9,Southpark,24,5,,,,,,,,,
69449,Kyle,9,The outside of the device seems to be covered in numerals. Inside are colors... which must open up to some sort of temporal time warp.,9,Southpark,134,25,,,,,,,,,
69450,Cartman,9,"Good. Keep working. We want to know all we can before we try to operate it.  All right, gentlemen, our containment center for the time warp is nearly complete. All that's left for us to do is get the device from the girls and bring it here.",9,Southpark,240,47,,,,,,,,,
69452,Cartman,9,"Don't be a fool, Craig. Do you really think the girls are just gonna hand that technology over?",9,Southpark,95,18,,,,,,,,,
69453,Stan,9,So what do you suggest?,9,Southpark,23,5,,,,,,,,,
69454,Cartman,9,"Heidi Turner  is going to have a slumber party on Thursday night. There's no doubt in my mind the girls will be using the future-telling device there. If we... can get somebody invited to that slumber party, not only can we get a hold of the device, but find out how to use it.",9,Southpark,277,54,,,,,,,,,
69455,Stan,9,"Yeah, there's just one problem: a boy can't go to a chicks' slumber party.",9,Southpark,74,14,,,,,,,,,
69456,Cartman,9,"No, not a boy, but a girl. One of us is gonna have to go undercover, show up in school tomorrow disguised as the new girl who just moved to town.",9,Southpark,145,31,,,,,,,,,
69458,Cartman,9,"No, not like Juwanna Mann, Kevin, okay? It's way cooler than that!",9,Southpark,66,12,,,,,,,,,
69459,Stan,9,"But if one of us pretends to be the new girl in class, the girls will wonder where that boy went.",9,Southpark,97,21,,,,,,,,,
69460,Cartman,9,"Which is why we have to fake that boy's death. It's simple spy stuff, my friends. Take your top man, fake his death, then send him in disguised as the enemy.",9,Southpark,157,31,,,,,,,,,
69461,Kyle,9,That's a pretty solid idea. But who?,9,Southpark,36,7,,,,,,,,,
69469,Butters,9,"Oh uh, hi Mom.",9,Southpark,14,4,,,,,,,,,
69470,Cartman,9,"Just keep stalling, Butters. We don't have the dead pig quite ready yet. ",9,Southpark,73,13,,,,,,,,,
69472,Butters,9,"N'aw geez! Now I'm gonna get grounded, too.",9,Southpark,43,8,,,,,,,,,
69473,Cartman,9,"Okay, it's ready! Step down, Butters. ",9,Southpark,38,6,,,,,,,,,
69476,Cartman,9,Okay. One! Two! ,9,Southpark,16,3,,,,,,,,,
69481,Cartman,9,Nice.,9,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
69487,Butters,9,Oh... Thank you. ,9,Southpark,17,3,,,,,,,,,
69488,Cartman,9,"Dude, I think it's totally working. The girls are totally buying it. ",9,Southpark,69,12,,,,,,,,,
69490,Butters,9,"Well, I'm just a typical little girl. I like dancin' and ponies. a-and  getting my snootch pounded on Friday night.",9,Southpark,115,20,,,,,,,,,
69493,Butters,9,Oh...,9,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
69495,Cartman,9,"Dude, they totally think he's a girl. ",9,Southpark,38,7,,,,,,,,,
69498,Butters,9,"Oh. Uhm, you know. Girl places.",9,Southpark,31,6,,,,,,,,,
69499,Cartman,9,"Dude, they've bought it hook line and sinker.  This is going swimmingly. ",9,Southpark,73,12,,,,,,,,,
69521,Stan,9,"All right, Butters, that's Heidi's house.",9,Southpark,41,6,,,,,,,,,
69522,Butters,9,"I can't do it, fellas. I can't go into a girls' slumber party! What if they find out I ain't a girl?",9,Southpark,100,22,,,,,,,,,
69524,Cartman,9,"Now Butters, we don't know exactly what is that girls do at their slumber parties. But if they start, you know, lezzing out, just roll with it.",9,Southpark,143,27,,,,,,,,,
69525,Butters,9,Lezzing out? What's lezzing out?,9,Southpark,32,5,,,,,,,,,
69526,Kyle,9,"Now look, Butters, when the girls bring out the future-telling device, pay attention to how it works. Once you know how to operate it, just grab it and get the hell out of there.",9,Southpark,178,34,,,,,,,,,
69527,Butters,9,Then I can go home and tell my mommy and daddy I'm not really dead?,9,Southpark,67,15,,,,,,,,,
69528,Stan,9,"Yeah dude, of course. Now go, the party's already started.",9,Southpark,58,10,,,,,,,,,
69530,Cartman,9,"Remember Butters, you must get that future-telling device from the girls at all costs! And just roll with it if they start lezzing out.",9,Southpark,135,24,,,,,,,,,
69535,Butters,9,How about we read each other's future?,9,Southpark,38,7,,,,,,,,,
69538,Butters,9,"Oh geez, are we gonna start lezzing out? ",9,Southpark,41,8,,,,,,,,,
69541,Kyle,9,"Jesus, what are they doing in there?",9,Southpark,36,7,,,,,,,,,
69542,Cartman,9,God only knows the horrors that go on in girls' slumber parties. Let's just hope Butters can survive it.,9,Southpark,104,19,,,,,,,,,
69543,Butters,9,AAAAAAAH NOO! Witches! You're all witches! ,9,Southpark,43,6,,,,,,,,,
69545,Butters,9,"Huh? Oh nothin'. Hey, you guys wanna tell each other's futures now?",9,Southpark,67,12,,,,,,,,,
69554,Butters,9,Nobody likes meee...,9,Southpark,20,3,,,,,,,,,
69558,Butters,9,You don't know how hard it is to be me. ,9,Southpark,40,10,,,,,,,,,
69560,Butters,9,You think I'm ugly-ehehee...,9,Southpark,28,4,,,,,,,,,
69562,Butters,9,You said I'm ugly and flat.,9,Southpark,27,6,,,,,,,,,
69566,Butters,9,You mean it?,9,Southpark,12,3,,,,,,,,,
69567,Kyle,9,"Dude, it's been to long. Something's wrong.",9,Southpark,43,7,,,,,,,,,
69568,Stan,9,Maybe they found him out.,9,Southpark,25,5,,,,,,,,,
69570,Stan,9,"Come on, we gotta go check on him. ",9,Southpark,35,8,,,,,,,,,
69571,Kyle,9,Can you see anything? ,9,Southpark,22,4,,,,,,,,,
69572,Stan,9,He's just dancing around.,9,Southpark,25,4,,,,,,,,,
69573,Cartman,9,That son of a bitch!,9,Southpark,20,5,,,,,,,,,
69575,Butters,9,My mom?  Hello?,9,Southpark,15,3,,,,,,,,,
69576,Cartman,9,Butters! Just what the fuck do you think you're doing?!,9,Southpark,55,10,,,,,,,,,
69577,Butters,9,"Well, I'm just having some fun with my girlfriends.",9,Southpark,51,9,,,,,,,,,
69578,Cartman,9,"You aren't there to have fun, you black asshole! You were supposed to be getting the future-telling device.",9,Southpark,107,18,,,,,,,,,
69579,Butters,9,"Well, I'm workin' on it.",9,Southpark,24,5,,,,,,,,,
69580,Cartman,9,Working on what?! Your dance moves?!,9,Southpark,36,6,,,,,,,,,
69581,Butters,9,"Now look! I'm getting pretty sick of this! Well I put myself through a lot, and you can't talk to me like that! Uh... mom.",9,Southpark,122,25,,,,,,,,,
69582,Cartman,9,"Just do what you were sent to do, dickface! ",9,Southpark,44,9,,,,,,,,,
69584,Butters,9,"Ah. Uhh, could I hold that?",9,Southpark,27,6,,,,,,,,,
69586,Butters,9,How?,9,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
69590,Butters,9,"Stand back! I had a... great time tonight, but I gotta do what I was sent here to do! ",9,Southpark,86,19,,,,,,,,,
69592,Cartman,9,Tango tango tango! We've got it! Let's get it to the containment center! Go! ,9,Southpark,77,14,,,,,,,,,
69593,Stan,9,"Come on, Butters.",9,Southpark,17,3,,,,,,,,,
69594,Butters,9,"No! That darn device is nothin' but trouble! Ah I'm done, and I'm goin' home to tell my Mom and Dad I'm not dead! ",9,Southpark,114,24,,,,,,,,,
69596,Cartman,9,"Haahahaha, we have the device now! The power belongs to us! ",9,Southpark,60,11,,,,,,,,,
69604,Butters,9,Hello?,9,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
69607,Butters,9,"Mom? Dad? Uh, it's me, Butters. I'm back. ",9,Southpark,42,8,,,,,,,,,
69610,Butters,9,"Hey Mom and Dad, I'm not- ",9,Southpark,26,6,,,,,,,,,
69612,Butters,9,"Uh, I guess you're probably a little surprised to see me.",9,Southpark,57,11,,,,,,,,,
69614,Cartman,9,"Gentlemen, this is a historic day for all of the boy, and mankind. In a few moments, we will know the future. ",9,Southpark,110,22,,,,,,,,,
69615,Stan,9,Ho-Hold on on guys. We're not sure what this device is capable of. Maybe we should wait until we've had more time to study it.,9,Southpark,126,25,,,,,,,,,
69616,Cartman,9,"No, No! We don't have time for that, Stan. It's time to ask questions.",9,Southpark,70,14,,,,,,,,,
69618,Cartman,9,"Because I do, Clyde.",9,Southpark,20,4,,,,,,,,,
69620,Cartman,9,I'm askin' the first question! Let's just start with something simple. Will Kyle die before he's twenty?,9,Southpark,104,17,,,,,,,,,
69621,Kyle,9,Wait! I don't wanna know that!,9,Southpark,30,6,,,,,,,,,
69624,Cartman,9,Will you all shut up so I can do this!?,9,Southpark,39,10,,,,,,,,,
69626,Kyle,9,"I don't wanna know when I'm going to die, fatass! ",9,Southpark,50,10,,,,,,,,,
69627,Stan,9,"Guys, guys, guys, stop!  Look at what this thing is doing to us. Butters was trying to tell me something outside the house. That this device is nothing but trouble. I think I know what he meant now.",9,Southpark,198,38,,,,,,,,,
69629,Stan,9,We risked everything to get it from the girls. How long before the girls attack us to get it back?,9,Southpark,98,20,,,,,,,,,
69632,Stan,9,And then what? Hide it forever from the government? From the... terrorists who want to use it for evil? Maybe... maybe nobody is meant to have this kind of power.,9,Southpark,162,30,,,,,,,,,
69634,Cartman,9,Are you guys nuts?! After everything we've gone through!?,9,Southpark,57,9,,,,,,,,,
69635,Stan,9,"We got it away from the girls. That's what matters. But now the right thing to do isn't using it ourselves, then we're no better than they are.",9,Southpark,143,28,,,,,,,,,
69636,Cartman,9,Think of the power!,9,Southpark,19,4,,,,,,,,,
69637,Kyle,9,It's too much power. For anybody. Stan's right. It has to be destroyed.,9,Southpark,71,13,,,,,,,,,
69638,Cartman,9,Are we sure about this? We'll never know the future.,9,Southpark,52,10,,,,,,,,,
69639,Stan,9,"Nobody will. That's the way it's suppose to be. Hit it, Kenny. ",9,Southpark,63,12,,,,,,,,,
69640,Cartman,9,"Damn, Ken.",9,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,
69642,Butters,9,Hi Dad.,9,Southpark,7,2,,,,,,,,,
69644,Butters,9,"Mom, Dad, can I come upstairs now?",9,Southpark,34,7,,,,,,,,,
69646,Butters,9,"Can I have something to eat? Well, I'm pretty hungry.",9,Southpark,53,10,,,,,,,,,
69655,Butters,9,"Uh hello, I'm Butters.",9,Southpark,22,4,,,,,,,,,
69657,Butters,9,Huh?,9,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
69661,Butters,9,Can I just have some Spaghetti-O's?,9,Southpark,35,6,,,,,,,,,
69667,Stan,10,"Oh no, dude, he's gonna put me with Wendy.",9,Southpark,42,9,,,,,,,,,
69668,Kenny,10,,9,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
69670,Stan,10,"So, I haven't even spoken to Wendy since we broke up.",9,Southpark,53,11,,,,,,,,,
69672,Stan,10,Kyle??,9,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
69699,Kyle,10,Hello? Oh hey dude.,9,Southpark,19,4,,,,,,,,,
69700,Stan,10,"So, what are you and Wendy doing?",9,Southpark,33,7,,,,,,,,,
69701,Kyle,10,"Oh, we're just makin' a cradle out of an egg carton for our egg. We figure that way it'll be easier to keep safe so we can get an A.",9,Southpark,132,30,,,,,,,,,
69702,Stan,10,Uh huh...,9,Southpark,9,2,,,,,,,,,
69703,Kyle,10,I don't think it's gonna be that hard to keep it from breaking. This whole assignment is stupid.,9,Southpark,96,18,,,,,,,,,
69704,Stan,10,"Yeah, well, so is your hat. ",9,Southpark,28,6,,,,,,,,,
69706,Stan,10,I can't. I'm busy.,9,Southpark,18,4,,,,,,,,,
69708,Stan,10,...So take it with you!,9,Southpark,23,5,,,,,,,,,
69710,Stan,10,"Well maybe I didn't want to have an egg with you, okay Bebe?!",9,Southpark,61,13,,,,,,,,,
69735,Stan,10,HA!,9,Southpark,3,1,,,,,,,,,
69737,Kyle,10,Why?,9,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
69745,Kyle,10,Who?,9,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
69747,Kyle,10,"Okay, there. Now we can carry this egg around in this case without it getting cracked.",9,Southpark,86,16,,,,,,,,,
69748,Stan,10,"Alright, give it to me. I'll take it home tonight.",9,Southpark,50,10,,,,,,,,,
69749,Kyle,10,"Look, Stan, you want me to just take care of this egg?",9,Southpark,54,12,,,,,,,,,
69750,Stan,10,Why do you say that?,9,Southpark,20,5,,,,,,,,,
69751,Kyle,10,"It's just that... I really need this A, Stan. And Bebe did say you almost broke your last egg.",9,Southpark,94,19,,,,,,,,,
69752,Stan,10,That's because I was pissed off!,9,Southpark,32,6,,,,,,,,,
69753,Kyle,10,At who?  Heh- hang on. ,9,Southpark,23,5,,,,,,,,,
69755,Kyle,10,Huh?,9,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
69757,Kyle,10,"Wendy, it isn't your egg anymore!",9,Southpark,33,6,,,,,,,,,
69759,Kyle,10,"Well, you might have made it, but we're the ones who are taking care of it now. You have your own egg to look out for!",9,Southpark,118,26,,,,,,,,,
69761,Kyle,10,"Wendy, I just wanna get an A, okay? Let's not make this any more confusing than it already is. &lt;&gt;",9,Southpark,103,20,,,,,,,,,
69763,Kyle,10,"Wendy, nothing's gonna happen to the egg. You can have it when the week is over and I have my grade.  Freakin' weirdos, man.",9,Southpark,124,24,,,,,,,,,
69764,Stan,10,"You think you're so great, don't you?! Well guess what?! Maybe I don't need your help! I'm taking the egg home tonight, and I'm gonna show everybody tomorrow that I'm every bit as good an egg-take-care-over as you! ",9,Southpark,215,38,,,,,,,,,
69765,Kyle,10,What the hell is wrong with everybody?,9,Southpark,38,7,,,,,,,,,
69771,Kenny,10,,9,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
69773,Stan,10,Fine!,9,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
69775,Stan,10,No problems at all!,9,Southpark,19,4,,,,,,,,,
69777,Stan,10,"It's right there, see? ",9,Southpark,23,4,,,,,,,,,
69779,Kyle,10,"Dude, it's totally fine.",9,Southpark,24,4,,,,,,,,,
69788,Cartman,10,I broke the egg.,9,Southpark,16,4,,,,,,,,,
69790,Cartman,10,"I tried to cover it up, tried to put it back together with modeling glue, tried to seal it with a soldering gun, but, I give up. I can't hide it, I broke the egg.",9,Southpark,162,35,,,,,,,,,
69792,Cartman,10,...No.,9,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
69794,Cartman,10,"No. That's why I'm here. I think you should still give Heidi an A on the project. You see, I broke the egg, not her. And so, I should get an F, and she should get an A, which means that together the grade should average out to C minus for both of us.",9,Southpark,250,54,,,,,,,,,
69796,Cartman,10,Damnit! I knew you'd say that! You always have it out for me!,9,Southpark,61,13,,,,,,,,,
69798,Cartman,10,"Mr. Garrison..., you've never been this cool to me before.",9,Southpark,58,10,,,,,,,,,
69800,Cartman,10,...Why are you doing this?,9,Southpark,26,5,,,,,,,,,
69802,Cartman,10,What do you want from me?,9,Southpark,25,6,,,,,,,,,
69804,Cartman,10,...No.,9,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
69806,Cartman,10,Yes teacher.,9,Southpark,12,2,,,,,,,,,
69825,Stan,10,Day five. I made it!  Hello?,9,Southpark,28,6,,,,,,,,,
69826,Kyle,10,"Dude, did you hear what's happening?",9,Southpark,36,6,,,,,,,,,
69827,Stan,10,What?,9,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
69828,Kyle,10,Garrison is taking us all on a field trip today. He wants to do the final egg check in front of the Governor's office!,9,Southpark,118,24,,,,,,,,,
69829,Stan,10,Governor's office?,9,Southpark,18,2,,,,,,,,,
69830,Kyle,10,"She's really taking this grade seriously, Stan. I'm gonna come over so that we can take our egg to school together, all right?",9,Southpark,126,23,,,,,,,,,
69831,Stan,10,"Aah, you'd like that, wouldn't you?! I took care of this egg, Kyle, not you!",9,Southpark,76,15,,,,,,,,,
69832,Kyle,10,"Okay, Stan, you've been an asshole to me all week! What is up?!",9,Southpark,63,13,,,,,,,,,
69833,Stan,10,"What's up?! Oh, nothing except that you've been trying to impress Wendy all week long like a pathetic dickhole!",9,Southpark,111,19,,,,,,,,,
69834,Kyle,10,Impress Wendy??,9,Southpark,15,2,,,,,,,,,
69835,Stan,10,You've set it all up to look like you're this awesome prince and I'm just a loser!,9,Southpark,82,17,,,,,,,,,
69836,Kyle,10,What the hell are you talking about?!,9,Southpark,37,7,,,,,,,,,
69837,Stan,10,"Well guess what?! I'm gonna take this egg to class myself! And I'm gonna hold it up in front of Wendy, and say ""See?! I'm every bit as good as Kyle is."" ",9,Southpark,153,32,,,,,,,,,
69839,Stan,10,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!,9,Southpark,17,1,,,,,,,,,
69840,Kyle,10,Stan?,9,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
69841,Stan,10,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!,9,Southpark,35,2,,,,,,,,,
69842,Kyle,10,"Stan? Stan, I think we should talk.",9,Southpark,35,7,,,,,,,,,
69843,Stan,10,"Dude, you should just go be with Wendy and be happy.",9,Southpark,52,11,,,,,,,,,
69844,Kyle,10,"Stan, I don't like Wendy.  All I cared about was getting an A in this stupid project!",9,Southpark,85,17,,,,,,,,,
69845,Stan,10,"Yeah well, I blew it. Now we're gonna fail and Wendy thinks I'm a total loser.",9,Southpark,78,16,,,,,,,,,
69846,Kyle,10,I thought you didn't care about Wendy anymore.,9,Southpark,46,8,,,,,,,,,
69847,Stan,10,I don't. She's totally lame. ,9,Southpark,29,5,,,,,,,,,
69848,Kyle,10,"Stan, there was never anything between Wendy and I.  I wouldn't go out with my best friend's ex-girlfriend.",9,Southpark,107,18,,,,,,,,,
69849,Stan,10,"I'm sorry I didn't trust you, Kyle. I'm obviously just a crappy best friend to have.",9,Southpark,84,16,,,,,,,,,
69850,Kyle,10,"Yyeah well, I-I'm sorry I didn't trust you either.",9,Southpark,50,9,,,,,,,,,
69851,Stan,10,Huh?,9,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,

69890,Stan,10,"Like I give a crap about what you think, Wendy. ",9,Southpark,48,10,,,,,,,,,
69894,Cartman,11,"Thank you, Mrs. Garrison.  My speech is entitled ""Ginger Kids: Children with red hair, light skin, and freckles.""  We've all seen them - on the playground, at the store, walking on the streets - they creep us out and make us feel sick to our stomachs. I'm talking of course about... ginger kids.  Aww sick! Gross! Ginger kids are born with a disease which causes very light skin, red hair, and freckles.  Aw, nasty! Yuck!  This disease is called Gingervitus, and it occurs because ginger kids have no souls.",9,Southpark,507,89,,,,,,,,,
69895,Kyle,11,What?!,9,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
69896,Cartman,11,"Kids who have gingervitus cannot be cured.  Ah sick!  Gross!  Yeck!  Because their skin is so light, ginger kids must avoid the sun. Not unlike...  vampires.",9,Southpark,157,26,,,,,,,,,
69898,Kyle,11,"That's not true, fatass! I have red hair, and I don't have to avoid the sun!",9,Southpark,76,16,,,,,,,,,
69899,Cartman,11,"I was getting to that, if you will let me.  Some people have red hair, but not light skin and freckles. These people are called ""daywalkers."" ",9,Southpark,142,26,,,,,,,,,
69900,Butters,11,Ho! Daywalkers!,9,Southpark,15,2,,,,,,,,,
69901,Kyle,11,This is all a bunch of crap!,9,Southpark,28,7,,,,,,,,,
69902,Cartman,11,"Mrs. Garrison, I'm really havin' a difficult time with all these interruptions...",9,Southpark,81,12,,,,,,,,,
69904,Kyle,11,"It's not a presentation, it's a hate speech! People aren't creeped out by gingers!",9,Southpark,82,14,,,,,,,,,
69907,Kyle,11,"Fine, I will! ",9,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,
69908,Cartman,11,"Fine! In the meantime, shut your Goddamned daywalker mouth!  Let's see, where was I? Oh yes! Like vampires, the ginger gene is a curse,  and unless we work to rid the earth of that curse, the gingers could envelop our lives in blackness for all time. It is time that we all admit to ourselves that gingers are vile and disgusting. In conclusion, I will leave you with this: if you think that the ginger problem is not a serious one,  think again.

69909,Kyle,11,Stupid supremacist asswipe!,9,Southpark,27,3,,,,,,,,,
69910,Stan,11,"Dude, what's the big deal?",9,Southpark,26,5,,,,,,,,,
69911,Kyle,11,"What's the big deal? Don't you understand what ignorant prejudice like that can lead to? I have to disprove Cartman's hateful rumors! Do you know any red-haired, freckled kids?",9,Southpark,176,29,,,,,,,,,
69912,Stan,11,What about the Foley family? I think they're all ginger.,9,Southpark,56,10,,,,,,,,,
69914,Kyle,11,Hey. Wuh I'm giving a speech tomorrow about people with red hair and freckles. Can I ask you a few questions?,9,Southpark,109,21,,,,,,,,,
69918,Kyle,11,"We... came to learn the facts about people with red hair, light skin and freckles.",9,Southpark,82,15,,,,,,,,,
69920,Stan,11,"I'm sorry, but I don't understand. You both have dark hair and brown eyes.",9,Southpark,74,14,,,,,,,,,
69927,Kyle,11,But it's... it's not true they... have no souls. ,9,Southpark,49,9,,,,,,,,,
69929,Kyle,11,I just had a couple more questions about-,9,Southpark,41,8,,,,,,,,,
69931,Kyle,11,"And so, red hair, light skin, and freckles are all passed down genetically. A child's red hair is not determined by the lack of a soul,  but by the melanins which control the pigment in all of our skins. Thank you. ",9,Southpark,215,41,,,,,,,,,
69933,Butters,11,"That was a very informative speech, Kyle.",9,Southpark,41,7,,,,,,,,,
69934,Kyle,11,Thanks Butters,9,Southpark,14,2,,,,,,,,,
69935,Cartman,11,"Informative if you want to die.  Gusy, don't forget. Kyle is a daywalker. Daywalkers are half-gingers themselves. Make no mistake: ginger kids are evil. You know who was ginger? Judas. And what did Judas do? Oh, he just got Jesus killed, that's all.  Look, I'm just saying what everyone else already thinks: Gingers are creepy. And one night, when you're all sleepin' in your room, the gingers are gonna getcha. They're gonna GETCHA! ",9,Southpark,434,73,,,,,,,,,
69936,Stan,11,You buying school lunch today?,9,Southpark,30,5,,,,,,,,,
69937,Kyle,11,"Nah, my mom packed me a kosher lunch.",9,Southpark,37,8,,,,,,,,,
69942,Kyle,11,There! You see?! This is what happens when Cartman is allowed his right to free speech!,9,Southpark,87,16,,,,,,,,,
69943,Stan,11,"That's just wrong, dude. I wish Cartman could see what it felt like to be ginger.",9,Southpark,81,16,,,,,,,,,
69944,Kyle,11,Hey.  That's a great idea!,9,Southpark,26,5,,,,,,,,,
69945,Kenny,11,,9,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
69946,Kyle,11,Can you guys meet me over at Cartman's house tonight at around midnight?,9,Southpark,72,13,,,,,,,,,

69948,Kyle,11,We're gonna teach that fat bastard a lesson!,9,Southpark,44,8,,,,,,,,,

69968,Kyle,11,"Wow, Cartman. You look... different.",9,Southpark,36,5,,,,,,,,,
69969,Cartman,11,"Yes, well, it's interesting you should point that out, Kyle. I went to the doctor yesterday, and apparently I suffer from a small skin pigment deficiency.",9,Southpark,154,26,,,,,,,,,
69970,Stan,11,"You mean,you're a ginger?",9,Southpark,25,4,,,,,,,,,
69971,Cartman,11,"Actually, gingervitus is the medical term.",9,Southpark,42,6,,,,,,,,,
69972,Kyle,11,Is that an umbrella you're using?,9,Southpark,33,6,,,,,,,,,
69973,Cartman,11,"Yes, Kyle.  The sun's rays are bad for my skin, so I need to be protected when I'm outside. Well, I'm glad we've gotten all that out of the way, and now we can just go on with our lives as normal.",9,Southpark,196,42,,,,,,,,,

69979,Kyle,11,"Dude, this is going awesome.",9,Southpark,28,5,,,,,,,,,

69994,Cartman,11,"I want to thank everyone for showing up today. I've called this meeting because, I don't know about you, but for one am sick and tired of being discriminated against!

70170,Stan,12,What what do I do?,9,Southpark,18,5,,,,,,,,,
70173,Stan,12,I'm totally depressed.,9,Southpark,22,3,,,,,,,,,
70175,Stan,12,I don't know.,9,Southpark,13,3,,,,,,,,,
70177,Stan,12,I'm not sure. But... I need two hundred and forty dollars.,9,Southpark,58,11,,,,,,,,,
70178,Randy,12,"Two hundred and forty dollars?! What'd you do, break something?!",9,Southpark,64,10,,,,,,,,,
70179,Stan,12,"No, I found a self-help program that can cure me.",9,Southpark,49,10,,,,,,,,,
70180,Randy,12,"Oh Jesus, the answer is no, Stanley.",9,Southpark,36,7,,,,,,,,,
70181,Stan,12,But I'm completely miserable and these people can help!,9,Southpark,55,9,,,,,,,,,
70183,Stan,12,Neither did I!,9,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,
70184,Randy,12,"Stanley, do you have any concept of money at all? Money doesn't grow on trees, you know?",9,Southpark,88,17,,,,,,,,,
70185,Stan,12,"Don't you care that I'm depressed?! What if I become suicidal, or, or become an alcoholic like Grandpa??",9,Southpark,104,18,,,,,,,,,
70187,Randy,12,"Well, if you really think your life is so bad, Stan, why don't you take what you have out of your bicycle savings?!",9,Southpark,115,23,,,,,,,,,
70188,Stan,12,...well but... but that's my money.,9,Southpark,35,6,,,,,,,,,
70189,Randy,12,"Yeah, well just like the rest of us, you have to make choices with your money. Do you want a bike, or do you not want to be depressed?",9,Southpark,134,29,,,,,,,,,
70192,Stan,12,I hope so.,9,Southpark,10,3,,,,,,,,,
70195,Stan,12,Really?,9,Southpark,7,1,,,,,,,,,
70197,Stan,12,Thetan levels...,9,Southpark,16,2,,,,,,,,,
70199,Stan,12,"So, this is gonna make me happy?",9,Southpark,32,7,,,,,,,,,
70201,Stan,12,What?,9,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
70204,Stan,12,Stan.,9,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
70223,Stan,12,I took out the garbage yesterday.,9,Southpark,33,6,,,,,,,,,
70224,Randy,12,"Right now, Stan!",9,Southpark,16,3,,,,,,,,,
70225,Stan,12,Aagh!  Stupid dumb garbage! ,9,Southpark,28,4,,,,,,,,,
70229,Randy,12,Stan! What the hell did you do?!,9,Southpark,32,7,,,,,,,,,
70230,Stan,12,I don't know! ,9,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,
70232,Randy,12,"All right, what the hell is going on here?!",9,Southpark,43,9,,,,,,,,,
70236,Randy,12,"Look, we don't want our son to join your group, okay?",9,Southpark,53,11,,,,,,,,,
70241,Randy,12,"Okay, Stan, it's late, go up to your room and get ready for bed! Let Mommy and Daddy handle this. ",9,Southpark,98,20,,,,,,,,,
70242,Stan,12,Jesus Christ...,9,Southpark,15,2,,,,,,,,,
70244,Stan,12,"Aw dude, I need to go to bed.",9,Southpark,29,8,,,,,,,,,
70246,Stan,12,"Yeah, I know who you are.",9,Southpark,25,6,,,,,,,,,
70248,Stan,12,"Well-h. I mean, you're not... you're not like as good as Leonardo DiCaprio, but you're okay, I guess.",9,Southpark,101,18,,,,,,,,,
70250,Stan,12,"I mean, you're not Gene Hackman or that guy who played Napoleon Dynamite, but you're okay.",9,Southpark,90,16,,,,,,,,,
70252,Stan,12,"Hey!  Dude, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.",9,Southpark,40,8,,,,,,,,,
70254,Stan,12,"Dude, this is my room!",9,Southpark,22,5,,,,,,,,,
70256,Stan,12,Dad! Tom Cruise won't come out of the closet!,9,Southpark,45,9,,,,,,,,,
70258,Stan,12,Tom Cruise locked himself in my closet and he won't come out. ,9,Southpark,62,12,,,,,,,,,
70259,Randy,12,"Mr. Cruise? Mr. Cruise, come out of the closet.",9,Southpark,47,9,,,,,,,,,
70261,Randy,12,"Come on, Mr. Cruise, this is ridiculous.",9,Southpark,40,7,,,,,,,,,
70263,Randy,12,What did you say to him?,9,Southpark,24,6,,,,,,,,,
70264,Stan,12,I just told him I thought the Napoleon Dynamite guy is a better actor than he is.,9,Southpark,81,17,,,,,,,,,
70265,Randy,12,"Oh boy.  Mr. Cruise, you can't just stay in the closet, alright? You need to come out.",9,Southpark,86,17,,,,,,,,,
70267,Randy,12,Tom Cruise won't come out of the closet.,9,Southpark,40,8,,,,,,,,,
70270,Randy,12,"Well, we CAN'T leave you alone because YOU won't come out of the closet!",9,Southpark,72,14,,,,,,,,,
70276,Randy,12,Wasn't L. Ron Hubbard a science-fiction writer?,9,Southpark,47,7,,,,,,,,,
70280,Randy,12,"Stan, do you want to hear the great secret doctrine of life behind Scientology?",9,Southpark,79,14,,,,,,,,,
70281,Stan,12,Sure.,9,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
70282,Randy,12,"All right, go ahead and tell him.",9,Southpark,33,7,,,,,,,,,
70284,Randy,12,Aw rats. ,9,Southpark,9,2,,,,,,,,,
70286,Stan,12,"I, I guess.",9,Southpark,11,3,,,,,,,,,
70294,Stan,12,But I don't know any of this stuff.,9,Southpark,35,8,,,,,,,,,
70296,Stan,12,"Okay, I'll try. I just wish I could write in my room, but Tom Cruise won't come out of the closet.",9,Southpark,98,21,,,,,,,,,
70308,Stan,12,"Yeah, yeah!",9,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
70309,Kyle,12,"Hey Stan, we're gonna go to the movies.",9,Southpark,39,8,,,,,,,,,
70310,Stan,12,I can't. I'm writing a new sacred doctrine for my church.,9,Southpark,57,11,,,,,,,,,
70311,Kyle,12,"Look, Stan, we're really getting concerned about this cult that you're getting into.",9,Southpark,84,13,,,,,,,,,
70312,Stan,12,"Cult? Scientology isn't a cult, Kyle. I've read all this stuff and it's based on fact.",9,Southpark,86,16,,,,,,,,,
70313,Kyle,12,"Dude, L. Ron Hubbard was a science-fiction writer. He lived on a boat with only young boys and got busted by the feds numerous times.",9,Southpark,133,25,,,,,,,,,
70314,Stan,12,I did not! Those are rumors put out by people who are afraid because they don't know the secret truth.,9,Southpark,102,20,,,,,,,,,
70315,Kyle,12,What secret truth??,9,Southpark,19,3,,,,,,,,,
70316,Stan,12,"I can't tell you unless you pay for a few years of audit counseling! All I know is that I was depressed before, and now I found meaning!",9,Southpark,136,28,,,,,,,,,
70317,Kyle,12,I didn't know you were depressed.,9,Southpark,33,6,,,,,,,,,
70318,Stan,12,"Neither did I! But now, if you guys can't accept this great thing I belong to, then I suppose we're no longer friends! ",9,Southpark,119,23,,,,,,,,,
70319,Cartman,12,"Stan, I just want you to know that I still hate Kyle more than you. ",9,Southpark,68,15,,,,,,,,,
70329,Randy,12,"Hello?  Hey, come out of there!",9,Southpark,31,6,,,,,,,,,
70334,Stan,12,"I wrote that um, our followers shouldn't fly in DC-8s anymore because they're too much like Xenu's evil cruisers.",9,Southpark,113,19,,,,,,,,,
70336,Stan,12,And I wrote that the evil Lord Xenu was recently broken out of galactic jail.,9,Southpark,77,15,,,,,,,,,
70338,Stan,12,"And best of all, I wrote that all the Scientologist's should no longer have to pay money to belong.",9,Southpark,99,19,,,,,,,,,
70340,Stan,12,"I I realize that to really be a church, we can't charge people for help.",9,Southpark,72,15,,,,,,,,,
70342,Stan,12,"... Well, it's not about the money, it's about the message, right?",9,Southpark,66,12,,,,,,,,,
70344,Stan,12,But you said that there were-,9,Southpark,29,6,,,,,,,,,
70346,Stan,12,"But then, why me? Why do you need me to write something so badly?",9,Southpark,65,14,,,,,,,,,
70348,Stan,12,Three million dollars?,9,Southpark,22,3,,,,,,,,,
70350,Stan,12,"Yeah. Yeah, I get you.",9,Southpark,22,5,,,,,,,,,
70359,Stan,12,"Uh, thanks. So, first of all, I've written that the brainwashed alien ghosts are actually from a galaxy called Nubanon.",9,Southpark,119,20,,,,,,,,,
70362,Stan,12,"And uh, oh,  ...I ...I can't do this.",9,Southpark,37,8,,,,,,,,,
70364,Stan,12,"Look, everybody, we're all looking for answer, you know. We all want to understand who we are and where we come from, but... sometimes we want to know the answers so badly that we... believe just about anything.",9,Southpark,211,38,,,,,,,,,
70367,Stan,12,I'm not the reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard. And... Scientology is just a big fat global scam.,9,Southpark,94,17,,,,,,,,,
70369,Stan,12,What??,9,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
70371,Stan,12,YOU told me it was a lie!,9,Southpark,25,7,,,,,,,,,
70378,Stan,12,Well fine! Go ahead and sue me!,9,Southpark,31,7,,,,,,,,,
70381,Stan,12,"Well go on, then! Sue me!",9,Southpark,25,6,,,,,,,,,
70383,Stan,12,"Okay, good! Do it! I'm not scared of you! Sue me!",9,Southpark,49,11,,,,,,,,,
70385,Cartman,13,I'm all wet! Sweet!,9,Southpark,19,4,,,,,,,,,
70386,Kyle,13,"Dude, Jambu is the best! ",9,Southpark,25,5,,,,,,,,,

70390,Cartman,13,Yes! Yeehehehes! ,9,Southpark,17,2,,,,,,,,,
70392,Stan,13,"Okay, where to next?",9,Southpark,20,4,,,,,,,,,
70393,Cartman,13,I think there's a sea lion show at 2:30.,9,Southpark,40,9,,,,,,,,,
70394,Kyle,13,Let's just stay here and watch the whale swim around some more.,9,Southpark,63,12,,,,,,,,,
70395,Cartman,13,Why?,9,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
70396,Kyle,13,"Dude, everyone's leaving! We can walk right up to the tank and really study him.",9,Southpark,80,15,,,,,,,,,
70397,Cartman,13,"Kyle, the show is over! The whale isn't gonna splash us any more, so who cares?",9,Southpark,79,16,,,,,,,,,
70398,Stan,13,"Let's go see the stingrays, and then we can go to the sea lion show.",9,Southpark,68,15,,,,,,,,,
70399,Cartman,13,Killer. ,9,Southpark,8,1,,,,,,,,,
70400,Kyle,13,I'll meet up with you guys in a little bit. I-I wanna hang out here some more.,9,Southpark,78,17,,,,,,,,,
70401,Cartman,13,"Okay, Kyle. We're gonna get splashed some more, but if you wanna go make love to the whale, that's fine. ",9,Southpark,105,20,,,,,,,,,
70402,Kyle,13,"Jambu? Jambu?  Cool! It worked! Hey, Jambu.",9,Southpark,43,7,,,,,,,,,
70404,Kyle,13,Who said that?,9,Southpark,14,3,,,,,,,,,
70406,Kyle,13,No way!,9,Southpark,7,2,,,,,,,,,
70408,Kyle,13,South Park.,9,Southpark,11,2,,,,,,,,,
70410,Kyle,13,What do you wanna talk about?,9,Southpark,29,6,,,,,,,,,
70412,Kyle,13,Rocket ships?,9,Southpark,13,2,,,,,,,,,
70414,Kyle,13,Why? Aren't you happy here?,9,Southpark,27,5,,,,,,,,,
70416,Kyle,13,This is amazing! But wait right here. I've gotta go tell my friends about this! ,9,Southpark,80,15,,,,,,,,,
70419,Cartman,13,"Heh! Come on, stingray!  Splash me! Ha! Hey, splash me!  Dude, these things are dumb. Let's go!",9,Southpark,95,17,,,,,,,,,
70420,Kyle,13,Hey you guys! You guys are not gonna believe this!,9,Southpark,50,10,,,,,,,,,
70421,Stan,13,What?,9,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
70422,Kyle,13,"Dude, he talks! The orca whale talks!",9,Southpark,37,7,,,,,,,,,
70423,Kenny,13,,9,Southpark,0,0,,,,,,,,,
70424,Kyle,13,I went up to Jambu's tank and I tapped three times like the trainer did. Jambu swam up and started talking to me about rocket ships! Come on! You gotta check it out! ,9,Southpark,166,33,,,,,,,,,
70425,Kyle,13,"Jambu! Jambu, I'm back!  How are you feeling?  Huhm. Jambu, you wanna talk about rocket ships?  Ja- Jambu? Are you still feelin' lonely here?",9,Southpark,141,24,,,,,,,,,
70426,Cartman,13,"Kyle, Kyle. Let it go, man.",9,Southpark,27,6,,,,,,,,,
70427,Kyle,13,"He talked! I swear to Abraham he talked, and he loves rocket ships!",9,Southpark,67,13,,,,,,,,,
70429,Kyle,13,"Goddammit, say something!",9,Southpark,25,3,,,,,,,,,
70430,Cartman,13,"Come on, guys, let's leave Kyle with his stupid whale.",9,Southpark,54,10,,,,,,,,,
70432,Kyle,13,"Jambu! Jambu, why didn't you speak up before?",9,Southpark,45,8,,,,,,,,,
70434,Kyle,13,Sick?,9,Southpark,5,1,,,,,,,,,
70435,Stan,13,I don't believe it.,9,Southpark,19,4,,,,,,,,,
70439,Cartman,13,You live on the moon?,9,Southpark,21,5,,,,,,,,,
70441,Kyle,13,Oh my God...,9,Southpark,12,3,,,,,,,,,
70442,Stan,13,Why don't you just tell the people here at the sea park?,9,Southpark,56,12,,,,,,,,,
70444,Kyle,13,That's terrible!,9,Southpark,16,2,,,,,,,,,
70447,Kyle,13,"Alright guys, listen up! This may sound a little strange, but, the whale, at the Denver Sea Park, is going to die, unless we get it to the moon,",9,Southpark,144,29,,,,,,,,,
70448,Butters,13,Well okay! Let's do it!,9,Southpark,23,5,,,,,,,,,
70449,Kyle,13,"The whale's name is Willzy-x, and he told us he's dying on our planet. We've come up wth a plan, but we're gonna need all of your help to make it work.",9,Southpark,151,32,,,,,,,,,
70451,Stan,13,It's true. The whale talked to all of us. In between shows at his orca tank.,9,Southpark,76,16,,,,,,,,,
70453,Kyle,13,"Weh-well, why didn't you tell anybody?",9,Southpark,38,6,,,,,,,,,
70455,Kyle,13,Well you're NOT crazy. The whale talked to all of us. And he needs our help getting him home.,9,Southpark,93,19,,,,,,,,,
70457,Kyle,13,"Nobody else is going to help him, you guys. We've got a chance to do something pretty special here. Are you with us?",9,Southpark,116,23,,,,,,,,,
70459,Kyle,13,Stan? ,9,Southpark,6,1,,,,,,,,,
70460,Stan,13,"All right. In order to make our plan work, we're going to need the pool from Clyde's back yard, Timmy's wheelchair, the Russian government, and all of our skateboards.",9,Southpark,167,29,,,,,,,,,
70462,Stan,13,"Craig, Token, get the slings ready. ",9,Southpark,36,6,,,,,,,,,
70463,Kyle,13,"Shhh. Willzy-x, don't say anything. We're gonna bust you out of here.",9,Southpark,69,12,,,,,,,,,
70488,Kyle,13,"Hi. My name's Kyle. Uh, I understand that your country flies people into space for money.",9,Southpark,89,16,,,,,,,,,
70490,Kyle,13,"I need to book one trip to the moon, please. Right away.",9,Southpark,56,12,,,,,,,,,
70492,Kyle,13,You can? Awesome!,9,Southpark,17,3,,,,,,,,,
70494,Kyle,13,Twenty... million?  Are you nuts? We don't have that kind of money.,9,Southpark,67,12,,,,,,,,,
70496,Kyle,13,But you need to understand: we have a whale here that needs to get back to his family on the moon.,9,Southpark,98,21,,,,,,,,,
70498,Stan,13,What happened?,9,Southpark,14,2,,,,,,,,,
70499,Kyle,13,They want twenty million dollars.,9,Southpark,33,5,,,,,,,,,
70500,Cartman,13,Twenty million? Just to go to the dumb moon?,9,Southpark,44,9,,,,,,,,,
70502,Stan,13,They were going to do it for that 'N Sync guy.,9,Southpark,46,11,,,,,,,,,
70504,Kyle,13,"All right, look, there's gotta be other Third-World countries with space programs. We've gotta split up and find someplace cheaper, that's all.",9,Southpark,143,22,,,,,,,,,
70532,Kyle,13,"I can't, Mom. We're working on our school project.",9,Southpark,50,9,,,,,,,,,
70534,Kyle,13,"Okay ma, thanks! ",9,Southpark,17,3,,,,,,,,,
70535,Butters,13,Shouldn't we get him back in the water?,9,Southpark,39,8,,,,,,,,,
70537,Cartman,13,"Yeah, we just have to keep him wet.",9,Southpark,35,8,,,,,,,,,
70538,Kyle,13,"Yes, yes, hello? Is this Mr. Su-gi-yama with the Japanese space program?  How much to take a whale into space?  Nu-no, we don't want you to eat the whale, we want you to send it to the moon. How much? Jesus Christ! Uh hang on.  Hello? Jimmy, any luck at the Chinese Embassy?",9,Southpark,274,53,,,,,,,,,
70540,Kyle,13,Ten million?? Well that's more than the Germans want!,9,Southpark,53,9,,,,,,,,,
70542,Kyle,13,"Damnit!  Tell me what to do, Willzy-x! How do we get you home??",9,Southpark,63,13,,,,,,,,,
70543,Cartman,13,He hasn't said a word since we brought him here.,9,Southpark,48,10,,,,,,,,,
70544,Kyle,13,Yeah... He must be really sick.  Hang on Willzy-x. There's still hope. Stan and Craig might still luck with the space program down in Mexico.,9,Southpark,141,25,,,,,,,,,
70546,Stan,13,"Uh, 'xcuse me, we're looking for the Mexican... Aeronautica y Spacia Administrashown?",9,Southpark,85,12,,,,,,,,,
70548,Stan,13,Thanks.  Is this the Mexican space program? ,9,Southpark,44,7,,,,,,,,,
70550,Stan,13,Does the Mexican space programs have rockets that can go to the moon?,9,Southpark,69,13,,,,,,,,,
70552,Stan,13,This rocket will fly to the moon?,9,Southpark,33,7,,,,,,,,,
70554,Stan,13,To the moon?,9,Southpark,12,3,,,,,,,,,
70556,Stan,13,We want to take something to the moon. How much would that cost?,9,Southpark,64,13,,,,,,,,,
70558,Stan,13,Two hundred? Million?,9,Southpark,21,3,,,,,,,,,
70560,Stan,13,"Quick, call Kyle.",9,Southpark,17,3,,,,,,,,,
70569,Cartman,13,"Hurry it up, dude, we have a rocket to catch.",9,Southpark,45,10,,,,,,,,,

70576,Cartman,13,Uh oh.,9,Southpark,6,2,,,,,,,,,
70581,Kyle,13,Huh?,9,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
70585,Kyle,13,"You don't understand! Willzy-x is from the moon! He'll die if we don't get him back, now! Willzy-x, you have to talk! Come on boy, you have to! I know you're sick, but you could do it!",9,Southpark,184,37,,,,,,,,,

70592,Kyle,13,"No! Please, we have to go!",9,Southpark,26,6,,,,,,,,,

70632,Kyle,13,"Come on, guys! ",9,Southpark,15,3,,,,,,,,,
70635,Kyle,13,"Hang on.  Hold on a second.  I gues... I... guess... this is... goodbye, Willzy-x.  I'm gonna miss you.  Hey, don't forget me, okay? I won't forget you. ",9,Southpark,153,27,,,,,,,,,
70636,Cartman,13,Oh crap! There's more of them! ,9,Southpark,31,6,,,,,,,,,

70652,Stan,13,I wonder... if he'll ever come back and visit us.,9,Southpark,49,10,,,,,,,,,

70763,Stan,14,No! You don't need another beer!,9,Southpark,32,6,,,,,,,,,
70764,Randy,14,I know that! But this disease is just eating me up! I hate my illness!,9,Southpark,70,15,,,,,,,,,
70765,Stan,14,"Dad, you just need to not drink so much. It's very simple.",9,Southpark,58,12,,,,,,,,,
70766,Randy,14,"I wish it was that simple, son. But if I don't give myself up to a higher power, this disease is going to kill me dead. I'm afraid the only thing that will cure me... is a miracle.",9,Southpark,180,38,,,,,,,,,
70773,Randy,14,Cure... cure disease. STAN!!,9,Southpark,28,4,,,,,,,,,

70875,Randy,14,But the statue wasn't a miracle!,9,Southpark,32,6,,,,,,,,,
70876,Stan,14,"Yeah. The statue wasn't a miracle, Dad. So that means you did it. That means you didn't have a drink for five days all on your own.",9,Southpark,131,27,,,,,,,,,

70878,Stan,14,No!,9,Southpark,3,1,,,,,,,,,
70879,Randy,14,No??,9,Southpark,4,1,,,,,,,,,
70880,Stan,14,"Dad, you like to drink. So have a drink once in a while. Have two. If you devote your whole life to completely avoiding something you like, then that thing still controls your life and, 'n you've never learned any discipline at all.",9,Southpark,232,43,,,,,,,,,
70881,Randy,14,"But, maybe... I'm just the kind of person who needs to have it all or nothing.",9,Southpark,78,16,,,,,,,,,
70882,Stan,14,"Naw. All or nothing is easy. But learning to drink a little bit, responsibly, that'sa disciprine. Disciprine... come from within. ",9,Southpark,130,20,,,,,,,,,

70888,Stan,14,All right!,9,Southpark,10,2,,,,,,,,,
70889,Randy,14,Come on!  Or maybe I'll have three beers. ,9,Southpark,42,8,,,,,,,,,
70890,Stan,14,That's probably okay if you spread it out.,9,Southpark,42,8,,,,,,,,,
70891,Randy,14,Well how about four?,9,Southpark,20,4,,,,,,,,,
70892,Stan,14,I think you're pushing it.,9,Southpark,26,5,,,,,,,,,
70893,Randy,14,How about twenty?,9,Southpark,17,3,,,,,,,,,
70894,Stan,14,That's not disciprine.,9,Southpark,22,3,,,,,,,,,
