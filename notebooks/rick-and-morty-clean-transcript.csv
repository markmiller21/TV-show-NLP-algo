3,Morty,1,"I know how to vacuum Mom and Dad, Summer, I've been doing it for six months!",2,Rick and Morty,76,16
5,Summer,1,Then you've been doing itwrongfor six months. Oh my god is that mildew?,2,Rick and Morty,71,13
7,Morty,1,It's not my fault we froze time on a humid day!,2,Rick and Morty,47,11
9,Summer,1,"You have dropped so many balls, man. Do you ever get scared Grampa Rick might make me his new sidekick?",2,Rick and Morty,103,20
11,Morty,1,What? What kind of monster are you?,2,Rick and Morty,35,7
13,Summer,1,A competent one.,2,Rick and Morty,16,3
15,Rick,1,Who cares about the *belch* thing you guys are talking about. The whole point of freezing time is to stop giving a f***. Put a shirt on your dumb dad and let's get this dumb universe rolling. Let's do this thing.,2,Rick and Morty,212,41
19,Rick,1,"Alright, listen you two, we froze time for a pretty long time, so when I unfreeze it, the world's time is gonna be fine, but our time's gonna need a little time to, you know, stabilize.",2,Rick and Morty,185,36
21,Morty,1,Our time is gonna be unstable? What does that even mean?,2,Rick and Morty,56,11
23,Rick,1,"It means relax and stop being a pussy, Morty. I thought you learned that by now. It also means don't touch your parents or we could shatter into countless theoretical shards.",2,Rick and Morty,174,31
25,Morty,1,"Wait a minute, what?",2,Rick and Morty,20,4
27,Rick,1,And away we go!,2,Rick and Morty,15,4
33,Morty,1,"Uh, did we ever put that mattress under Mr. Benson?",2,Rick and Morty,51,10
35,Rick,1,"Shhh, Morty!",2,Rick and Morty,12,2
39,Jerry,1,"...A THING OR TWO ABOUT... wait, what? Was the house...? When we pulled up I could have sworn the house was completely trashed.",2,Rick and Morty,127,23
41,Rick,1,"Negative visualization, Jerry. It explains a lot about where you're at. Hi, sweety.",2,Rick and Morty,83,13
43,Beth,1,"Hi, dad.",2,Rick and Morty,8,2
47,Beth,1,"Summer, Morty, are you okay?",2,Rick and Morty,28,5
49,Morty,1,W-We just missed you a lot.,2,Rick and Morty,27,6
51,Summer,1,"Yeah, we missed you so much. Too much to hug you though.",2,Rick and Morty,56,12
55,Rick,1,"Yeah it would literally destroy them. Now listen, why doi'why doi'whyi'why don't you guys go get a free sunday ice cream,  go out there and get some ice creams. Here's five hundred dollars cash in unmarked moneys. I'm just gonna put it on the floor and uh, kick it on over to ya. You guys go nuts.",2,Rick and Morty,297,57
57,Jerry,1,"This better not be a bribe. If I find a single thing out of place in this house, my love of ice cream won't save you. I'll get my jacket.",2,Rick and Morty,137,30
59,Beth,1,"Sweety, is your shirt on backwards?",2,Rick and Morty,35,6
63,Summer,1,*Gasp*,2,Rick and Morty,6,1
65,Morty,1,Oh!,2,Rick and Morty,3,1
67,Rick,1,Uh oh.,2,Rick and Morty,6,2
71,Jerry,1,"Yeah, I like it this way. I'm not stupid.",2,Rick and Morty,41,9
75,Morty,1,Phew...,2,Rick and Morty,7,1
77,Summer,1, *Exhales*,2,Rick and Morty,10,1
81,Jerry,1,Man that guy is the Red Grin Grumble to pretending he knows what's going on.,2,Rick and Morty,76,15
85,Rick,1,"Oh you agree, huh?  You like that Red Grin Grumble reference?  Well guess what? I made him up. You really are your father's children. Think for yourselves, don't be sheep.",2,Rick and Morty,171,30
95,Summer,1,"God, I feel terrible.",2,Rick and Morty,21,4
97,Rick,1,"Yup, it really makes you appreciate how fickle the universe can be. One minute you're falling off a roof for six months, the next minute, bam!",2,Rick and Morty,142,26
101,Morty,1,"Uh, just to be clear, it was Summer's job to put the mattress under-",2,Rick and Morty,68,14
103,Summer,1," Uh, what? It was your job, Morty. ",2,Rick and Morty,35,7
105,Morty,1,Nuh uh!,2,Rick and Morty,7,2
107,Summer,1,Yeah huh!,2,Rick and Morty,9,2
109,Rick,1,"Actually, sorry Summer, I gotta back the M bomb on this one. I remember the conversation. We told Morty to replace all the bank's money with cookies, your job was to put the mattress under Mr. Benson.",2,Rick and Morty,200,37
111,Morty,1,"Boom! In your face Summer! You really dropped the ball, man.",2,Rick and Morty,60,11
113,Summer,1,"Shut up Morty, you vindictive little turd!",2,Rick and Morty,42,7
115,Morty,1,You shut up you big... female asshole!,2,Rick and Morty,38,7
121,Summer,1,I didn't!,2,Rick and Morty,9,2
123,Morty,1,You didn't what?,2,Rick and Morty,16,3
127,Morty,1,What's yours?,2,Rick and Morty,13,2
131,Morty,1,You shut up!,2,Rick and Morty,12,3
133,Rick,1,Whoa whoa wh-what the hell hell hell hell hell?,2,Rick and Morty,47,9
137,Rick,1,"Oh god, oh no, what did you guys just do?",2,Rick and Morty,41,10
139,Summer,1,What do you mean?,2,Rick and Morty,17,4
141,Summer,1,What couldwedo?,2,Rick and Morty,15,2
143,Summer,1,"Wait, what am I saying?",2,Rick and Morty,23,5
145,Rick,1,*belch* Were either of you guys uncertain about anything just now?,2,Rick and Morty,66,11
147,Morty,1,Oh man... I don't feel good.,2,Rick and Morty,28,6
149,Morty,1,Am I me? I think so.,2,Rick and Morty,20,6
151,Morty,1,A-am I talking right now?,2,Rick and Morty,25,5
153,Morty,1,"Wait, who said that?",2,Rick and Morty,20,4
155,Rick,1,"Alright both of you, just don't move, don't speak, don't think. I have to check something.",2,Rick and Morty,90,16
157,Summer,1,What should we do Morty?,2,Rick and Morty,24,5
159,Summer,1,I'm gonna help Grampa.,2,Rick and Morty,22,4
161,Morty,1,Let's see if he needs help.,2,Rick and Morty,27,6
163,Morty,1,What do you meanyou'regonna help him.,2,Rick and Morty,37,6
165,Summer,1,"Ugh, I can help too.",2,Rick and Morty,20,5
169,Morty,1,What's going on Rick?,2,Rick and Morty,21,4
171,Summer,1,What's happening Grampa?,2,Rick and Morty,24,3
173,Rick,1,Shut up!  Oh crap are you kidding me? Two dots? This never needs to be more than one dot. The two of you made us uncertain!,2,Rick and Morty,123,26
175,Morty,1,What do you mean?,2,Rick and Morty,17,4
177,Morty,1,What? In English?,2,Rick and Morty,17,3
179,Summer,1,What? English please?,2,Rick and Morty,21,3
181,Summer,1,What are you talking about?,2,Rick and Morty,27,5
183,Rick,1,Our time is fractured. You two somehow created a feedback loop of uncertainty that's split our reality into two equally possible impossiblities. W-we're exactly like a man capable of sustaining a platonic friendship with an attractive female co-worker. We're entirely hypothetical.,2,Rick and Morty,281,41
185,Morty,1,But I thought there were infinite timelines.,2,Rick and Morty,44,7
187,Rick,1,"We're not on any timeline, dummy. Look.",2,Rick and Morty,39,7
191,Morty,1,Oh my god!,2,Rick and Morty,10,3
193,Summer,1,Are those cats?,2,Rick and Morty,15,3
195,Rick,1,"I assume they're Schrodinger's cats. A-actually, I assume they both are and aren't, just like us.",2,Rick and Morty,97,16
199,Rick,1,–Mom and Dad?” Get your head out of your family's ass. The three of us are lost in a timeless oblivion. Your parents get to exist. They're probably living it up in some pointless grounded story about their sh*t marriage.,2,Rick and Morty,220,40
203,Jerry,1,Cold Stone Creamery is the best. What should we do with ourremainingtwenty dollars?,2,Rick and Morty,83,13
205,Beth,1,You realize they sing no matter how much you tip.,2,Rick and Morty,49,10
209,Beth,1,Holy sh*t! What happened?,2,Rick and Morty,25,4
211,Jerry,1,I hit a deer! W-we have to tell the cops you were driving.,2,Rick and Morty,58,13
213,Beth,1,W-what?,2,Rick and Morty,7,1
215,Jerry,1,This is Rum Raisin!,2,Rick and Morty,19,4
219,Beth,1,It's still alive.,2,Rick and Morty,17,3
221,Jerry,1,"Well, do we- doIuh, get a big rock? Or-",2,Rick and Morty,39,9
223,Beth,1,"It's not an armadillo, asshole!",2,Rick and Morty,31,5
225,Jerry,1,"I thought that's what a man's supposed to say, it's not like I could have actually done it.",2,Rick and Morty,91,18
227,Beth,1,"If we were near a hospital, I could treat it, but I-I think we have to just-",2,Rick and Morty,76,17
229,Jerry,1,"It's okay, this is just something that happens. And even if we were in a hospital, what could we do, you're a horse surgeon, not a deer surgeon.",2,Rick and Morty,144,28
231,Beth,1,So...,2,Rick and Morty,5,1
233,Jerry,1,Well don't different animals-,2,Rick and Morty,29,4
235,Beth,1,Require different levels of skill to keep alive?,2,Rick and Morty,48,8
237,Jerry,1,Oh god...,2,Rick and Morty,9,2
239,Beth,1,"Get the deer in the car, Jerry.",2,Rick and Morty,31,7
241,Jerry,1,Yes Beth.,2,Rick and Morty,9,2
245,Rick,1,"This is why you don't freeze time, you guys. It's incredibly irresponsible.",2,Rick and Morty,75,12
247,Morty,1,And you did it so you could clean the house after a party.,2,Rick and Morty,58,13
249,Morty,1,And you did it so you could clean the house after a party?,2,Rick and Morty,58,13
251,Rick,1,"Look, there's no time to hold me accountable, Morty. Like literally no time. Look around. Uncertainty is inherently unsustainable. Eventually everything either is or isn't. And we've got about four hours to be –is”.",2,Rick and Morty,215,34
253,Morty,1,Or...,2,Rick and Morty,5,1
255,Morty,1,Or?,2,Rick and Morty,3,1
257,Rick,1,We –isn't”,2,Rick and Morty,10,2
259,Rick,1,"Alright, since this time crystal exists in both possibilities, and since it's impossible that I didn't nail this, I'm probably about to press this button in both possibilities at exactly the same time.",2,Rick and Morty,201,33
263,Rick,1,"Whatever you're asking, the answer is I'm amazing. And away we go!",2,Rick and Morty,66,12
267,Rick,1,"Huh, what do you know, it's working",2,Rick and Morty,35,7
269,Summer,1,"Ow, ow ouch!",2,Rick and Morty,12,3
271,Morty,1,"Whoa, ow, ow.",2,Rick and Morty,13,3
273,Rick,1,Oh sh*t.,2,Rick and Morty,8,2
277,Rick,1,What the hell is wrong with you two!? Ii'I mi'I mi'I mean you four!?,2,Rick and Morty,68,14
281,Rick,1,"Good I'm glad it was painful. You do deserve it! I saw you, you're both *belch* all over the damn place. We've been split for twenty minutes and your lives are already scattered to the quantum f***ing wind? What the hell do either of you have to be so uncertain about? Your brand of zit cream? Which chair to sit in while I do everything? Come on, spit it out!",2,Rick and Morty,360,70
283,Morty,1,"Well you don't exactly make it easy, Rick!",2,Rick and Morty,42,8
285,Morty,1,You make fun of me all the time and now Summer's doing it too!,2,Rick and Morty,62,14
287,Morty,1,You're always picking on me and now you got someone to kiss your ass!,2,Rick and Morty,69,14
289,Summer,1,Me? What about you? Would you get more excited to see me fail? You want Grampa all to yourself!,2,Rick and Morty,95,19
291,Summer,1,"Me? You're just as mean to me because you're jealous, because you want Grampa all to yourself!",2,Rick and Morty,94,17
293,Rick,1,"Alright, cool it, I see what's happening here. You're both young, you're both unsure about your place in the universe, you both wanna be –Grampa's favorite.” I can fix this. Morty sit here, Summer, you sit here. Now listen, I know the two of you are very different from each other in a lot of ways, but you have to understand that as far as Grampa's concerned, you're both pieces of shit. Yeah, I can prove it mathematically. Actually, let me grab my whiteboard. This has been a long time coming anyway.",2,Rick and Morty,503,92
299,Beth,1,"Emergency, wounded deer coming in.",2,Rick and Morty,34,5
307,Beth,1,"I'm a certified horse surgeon, and this deer needs medical attention. Nurse, please move that snake.",2,Rick and Morty,100,16
311,Beth,1,"As a vet, I'm sure you know a deer is closer to a horse than you are to a doctor, so let's save the measuring for when our dicks are out, it's time to save a life!",2,Rick and Morty,163,37
317,Beth,1,"That's odd, this deer's wounded.",2,Rick and Morty,32,5
319,Jerry,1,"Uh, yeah, I was there, you don't have to rub it in.",2,Rick and Morty,51,12
321,Beth,1,I mean it's been shot. With a gun.,2,Rick and Morty,34,8
329,Beth,1,"*sigh* We don't have time for this, okay! I need anesthetic, and deer saline!",2,Rick and Morty,77,14
335,Beth,1,"In your dreams, bitch! Scalpel!",2,Rick and Morty,31,5
339,Rick,1,"So in conclusion, you're both equally mercurial, overly sensitive, clingy hysterical bird brained homunculi. And I honestly can't tell the two of you half the time because I don't go by height or age, I go by amount of pain in my ass, which makes you both identical. Alright, everything resolved? Everybody nice and certain about their position inmyworld?",2,Rick and Morty,355,59
343,Rick,1,"Alright, perfect. Sit still, *belch* arms down, I'm gonna do this again, this time, be like Grampa.",2,Rick and Morty,99,17
345,Morty,1,You mean drunk?,2,Rick and Morty,15,3
347,Rick,1,And away we go!,2,Rick and Morty,15,4
349,Rick,1,What's that? You got something to say?,2,Rick and Morty,38,7
351,Morty,1,No.,2,Rick and Morty,3,1
353,Rick,1,And away we go!,2,Rick and Morty,15,4
355,Rick,1,"Huh, that's weird. Oh my god.",2,Rick and Morty,29,6
357,Summer,1,What?,2,Rick and Morty,5,1
359,Rick,1,That son of a bitch is gonna kill me!,2,Rick and Morty,37,9
361,Rick,1,"Follicle unfeeling sociopath. Don't you get it? He thinks he can save his own skin by using the crystal to kill me. He probably figures it's easier to eliminate one of the possibilities rather than merge them. I have to admit, it's always in the back of my mind too. The difference is I would never do it! Until now...",2,Rick and Morty,318,60
363,Rick,1,"Don't you get it? don't you get it? The other Rick isn't trying to merge us anymore. He thinks he can save his own skin by using the crystal to kill me. He probably figures it's easier to eliminate one of the possibilities rather than merge them. I have to admit, it's always in the back of my mind too. The difference is I would never do it! Until now...",2,Rick and Morty,355,70
365,Morty,1,Rick what the hell are you doing?,2,Rick and Morty,33,7
367,Rick,1,Saving our lives. After he takes me out he's gonna be coming for you!,2,Rick and Morty,69,14
369,Summer,1,Who?,2,Rick and Morty,4,1
371,Rick,1,Me!,2,Rick and Morty,3,1
373,Rick,1,You see that? Get down.,2,Rick and Morty,23,5
375,Summer,1,Ahh!,2,Rick and Morty,4,1
377,Morty,1,Whoa whoa!,2,Rick and Morty,10,2
379,Rick,1,I told you he's a psycho!,2,Rick and Morty,25,6
381,Rick,1,He's lost it. The time fracture must have made him crazy!,2,Rick and Morty,57,11
383,Rick,1,I don't know what to do! I don't know what to do!,2,Rick and Morty,49,12
389,Rick,1,"Oh god, now there's three of them, we're outnumbered! Get in the cupboards! Wait, don't don't do that, they'll know... wait wait, think about getting in the cupboards but don't really. AAAAH IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT YOU SICK F***S? YOU WANNA SEE CHILDREN DIE?",2,Rick and Morty,256,45
393,Beth,1,"You son of a bitch, you don't stop living until I SAY SO!",2,Rick and Morty,57,13
405,Jerry,1,She normally works on horses.,2,Rick and Morty,29,5
407,Beth,1,"Jerry, if you're not gonna help, get the f*** out of here! I will reach into heaven and yank your screaming deer soul back!",2,Rick and Morty,123,24
413,Rick,1,"Shh shh... I know where you are, you creepy old monster... I know how you think! Oh, is this where you think I'm going? You think I'm standing here? Well maybe you're right!",2,Rick and Morty,173,33
417,Summer,1,"Holy sh*t, now what?",2,Rick and Morty,20,4
419,Morty,1,"Well if all of me knocked out all the Ricks, and you peed in all of your pants, doesn't that mean that we're all synchronized?",2,Rick and Morty,126,25
421,Summer,1,Right.,2,Rick and Morty,6,1
423,Morty,1,"Okay... so from now on, whatever we do we have to be certain.",2,Rick and Morty,61,13
425,Summer,1,Right...,2,Rick and Morty,8,1
427,Morty,1,I think I'm certain we're F'd in the A.,2,Rick and Morty,39,9
433,Rick,1,"Oh god, my head. What did you guys do?",2,Rick and Morty,38,9
435,Morty,1,"We put you in a dog crate because you were acting crazy, and you caused another time fracture.",2,Rick and Morty,94,18
437,Summer,1,You tried to kill yourself!,2,Rick and Morty,27,5
439,Rick,1,"Only in self defense, myself tried to kill me first! Guys, I don't expect you to understand this, but time breaking twice means our problem is two times bigger and we've got half as much time to solve it. Well actually, I do expect you to understand that, it's basic math. C-could someone just let me out of here? If I die in a cage I lose a bet.",2,Rick and Morty,346,69
441,Summer,1,Well is there some way you can prove you're not a threat to yourself and others anymore?,2,Rick and Morty,88,17
443,Rick,1,"Ah, for god's sake, alright here, give me the time crystal.",2,Rick and Morty,59,11
445,Morty,1,W-what're you doing?,2,Rick and Morty,20,3
447,Rick,1,"Calling myself. Here, listen, *belch* it'll probably go to voice mail since, you know, I'm calling myself.",2,Rick and Morty,106,17
451,Rick,1,"Don't fall for it, it's a bit.",2,Rick and Morty,30,7
455,Rick,1,"Hey Rick, it's Rick. Listen, I'm sorry about earlier. No hard feelings. I know you know I mean it too. Take it easy. Whoa. Damn, look at this, I'm blown up. Three new voicemails. *voicemail repeats* Yeah yeah, I heard this one. *voicemail repeats two more times* You get the idea *belch* we're cool now.",2,Rick and Morty,303,55
457,Summer,1,"Okay, well we're still not gonna let you out of this crate.",2,Rick and Morty,59,12
459,Rick,1,Fine I'll just do it myself.,2,Rick and Morty,28,6
461,Morty,1,If you could get out that whole time why didn't you?,2,Rick and Morty,52,11
463,Rick,1,"Because I waited until I was certain it was what I wanted to do, Morty. That's the difference between you and me. I'm certain, and you're a walking burlap sack filled with turds.",2,Rick and Morty,178,33
465,Morty,1,"You know, geez Rick, yi'yi'you're really tearing into me right now. You know, words hurt.",2,Rick and Morty,89,15
469,Morty,1,Oh my god!,2,Rick and Morty,10,3
471,Morty,1,It's a monster!,2,Rick and Morty,15,3
475,Summer,1,It's a monster!,2,Rick and Morty,15,3
481,Summer,1, *Screams*,2,Rick and Morty,10,1
489,Rick,1,*sigh*,2,Rick and Morty,6,1
499,Rick,1,*groan*,2,Rick and Morty,7,1
503,Morty,1,"Oh way to go, Rick.",2,Rick and Morty,19,5
505,Summer,1,"Yeah Grampa, way to go.",2,Rick and Morty,23,5
507,Rick,1,"Oh, what you're just gonna listen to this guy now? He's got a giant testicle for a head! He came here in a bubble. For all we know he could be the David Berkowitz of Nutsack Land.",2,Rick and Morty,179,37
531,Rick,1,"Yes, we're back, problem solved.",2,Rick and Morty,32,5
533,Summer,1,"Yes, we're back to our own time.",2,Rick and Morty,32,7
535,Morty,1,"Yes no more cats, no more cats, oh you did it, you fixed it.",2,Rick and Morty,60,14
539,Rick,1,How long exactly do we have to wear these things? They're really embarassing.,2,Rick and Morty,77,13
543,Summer,1,Time prison?,2,Rick and Morty,12,2
547,Summer,1,You stole a time freezing crystal from testical monsters?,2,Rick and Morty,57,9
549,Rick,1,"I would have been happy to pay for it, Summer, but they don't exactly sell them at Costco.Besides, there's a larger lesson to be learned here. Get him!",2,Rick and Morty,151,28
557,Beth,1,Isn't there a kitten somewhere that needs a manicure?,2,Rick and Morty,53,9
561,Jerry,1,"Honey, it's gonna be okay. These men are from the Cervine Institute of Elk, Moose Deer and Stag. They can take this deer to a helicopter and fly it to the country's top deer surgeon on a wildlife reserve across the state border, where your jurisdiction ends.",2,Rick and Morty,258,47
567,Jerry,1,We did it...,2,Rick and Morty,12,3
573,Morty,1,Why are you doing this?,2,Rick and Morty,23,5
577,Rick,1,What if I told you there's a huge ticket up right behind you?,2,Rick and Morty,61,13
581,Rick,1,"Alright, hear me out on this. You're immortal, right, which means your life is infinite. Well in that case there's 100% chance that you'll eventually do everything,includingturning around to look behind you.",2,Rick and Morty,207,32
587,Rick,1,"Ah, god, gross and weird!",2,Rick and Morty,25,5
597,Rick,1,"Summer, Morty, take off your collars!",2,Rick and Morty,37,6
601,Rick,1,Good question. I suppose the answer is,2,Rick and Morty,38,7
607,Rick,1,I have no idea!,2,Rick and Morty,15,4
609,Rick,1,I'm not sure.,2,Rick and Morty,13,3

2104,Morty,1," Wow, that's pretty crazy, Rick.",1,Rick and Morty,32,5
2105,Rick,1," There's just one problem, Morty one little hang-up. The dimension I visited was so advanced, that  they had also halted the aging process, and everyone there was young, Morty, and they had been forever. I was the only old person there, Morty.  It was like I was some sort of, you know, celebrity, walking around. I-I was fascinating to them. There were a lot of attractive women there, Morty, and they they they they all wanted time with me. I had a lot of fun with a lot of young ladies, but I spent so much time there, my interdimensional portal device it's got no charge left, Morty. It's got no charge left.",1,Rick and Morty,612,113
2106,Morty,1, What?!,1,Rick and Morty,7,1
2107,Rick,1," It's as good as garbage, Morty. It's not gonna work anymore, Morty.",1,Rick and Morty,68,12
2108,Morty,1," Oh, geez, Rick, that's not good. W-what are we gonna do? I-I have to be back at school right now. How are we gonna get back home?",1,Rick and Morty,130,27
2109,Rick,1," There's ways to get back home, Morty. It's just it's just gonna be a little bit of a hassle. We're gonna have to go through interdimensional customs, so you're gonna have to do me a real solid.",1,Rick and Morty,194,37
2110,Morty,1, Uh-oh.,1,Rick and Morty,7,1

2114,Morty,1," Oh, geez, Rick. I really don't want to have to do that.",1,Rick and Morty,56,12
2115,Rick,1," Well, somebody's got to do it, Morty. Th-these seeds aren't gonna get through customs unless they're in someone's rectum, Morty",1,Rick and Morty,128,20
2116,Morty,1, Uuuh.,1,Rick and Morty,6,1
2117,Rick,1," And they'll fall right out of mine. I've done this too many times, Morty. I mean, you're young. Y-y-you've got your whole life ahead of you, and your anal cavity is still taut, yet malleable. You got to do it for grandpa, Morty. Y-you've got to put these seeds inside your butt.",1,Rick and Morty,279,52

2120,Morty,1," Oh, man.",1,Rick and Morty,9,2
2123,Beth,1, What? Why didn't you notify us?,1,Rick and Morty,32,6
2125,Jerry,1," Boom! Told you! In your face! He is ruining our child! Wait, what am I celebrating?",1,Rick and Morty,84,16
2128,Beth,1, Summer?,1,Rick and Morty,8,1
2129,Summer,1, What kind of God lets this happen?,1,Rick and Morty,35,7
2137,Rick,1," I don't like it here, Morty. I can't abide bureaucracy. I don't like being told where to go and what to do. I consider it a violation. Did you get those seeds all the way up your butt?",1,Rick and Morty,185,38
2138,Morty,1," Yeah, Rick. Let's just get this over with, okay? I mean, these things are pointy. They hurt.",1,Rick and Morty,93,17
2139,Rick,1," That means they're good ones. You're a good kid, Morty. Those mega seeds are super valuable to my work. You've been a huge help to me. I'm gonna be able to do a--all kind of things with them. It's gonna be great, Morty. A--all kinds of science.",1,Rick and Morty,245,47

2171,Morty,1," They're not robots, Rick!",1,Rick and Morty,26,4
2172,Rick,1," It's a figure of speech, Morty. They're bureaucrats. I don't respect them. Just keep shooting, Morty. You have no idea what prison is like here!",1,Rick and Morty,145,25
2174,Morty,1, Holy crap! This is insane!,1,Rick and Morty,27,5
2176,Rick,1," Come on, Morty! We got to get the hell out of here!",1,Rick and Morty,52,12

2188,Rick,1," Oh, hi, Jerry.  Oh, my goodness, Morty! What are you doing out of class? We talked about this. Your your parents and I are very disappointed in in this behavior ... No? No takers?",1,Rick and Morty,180,34
2190,Rick,1, You guys should really not be touching that stuff. It's beyond your reasoning.,1,Rick and Morty,79,13
2191,Beth,1, You're beyond our reasoning!,1,Rick and Morty,29,4
2192,Rick,1, Takes one to know one.,1,Rick and Morty,23,5
2193,Beth,1," Dad, how could you make my son miss an entire semester of school? I mean, it's not like he's a hot girl. He can't just bail on his life and set up shop in someone else's.",1,Rick and Morty,171,36
2194,Rick,1, What what are you guys doing with my stuff?,1,Rick and Morty,44,9
2195,Beth,1, We're moving you to a nursing home.,1,Rick and Morty,36,7

2199,Beth,1, It's personal.,1,Rick and Morty,15,2
2200,Morty,1," Dad, mom, come on. Rick just needed my help is all.",1,Rick and Morty,52,11
2201,Jerry,1," Morty, stay out of this. You are obviously not capable of judging these situations on your own.",1,Rick and Morty,96,17
2202,Rick,1, What are you trying to say about Morty? That he's stupid or something?,1,Rick and Morty,71,13
2203,Beth,1," Oh, don't high-road us, dad. You know fully well that Morty is the last child that needs to be missing classes.",1,Rick and Morty,112,21
2204,Rick,1, I-I-I don't know what you mean by that. Can can can you be a little bit more specific?,1,Rick and Morty,87,18
2205,Jerry,1," Oh, for crying out- he's got some kind of disability or something. Is that what you want us to say?",1,Rick and Morty,100,20
2206,Morty,1, I do?,1,Rick and Morty,6,2
2207,Jerry,1," Well, duh doy, son. Look, I love you, Morty, but we both know you're not as fast as the other kids, and if you want to compete in this world, you got to work twice as hard.",1,Rick and Morty,173,37

2214,Jerry,1, Holy crap. He's right.,1,Rick and Morty,23,4
2215,Rick,1," Morty, tell your parents the first law of Thermodynamics.",1,Rick and Morty,58,9
2216,Morty,1," ""The increment in the internal energy of a system is equal to the increment of heat supplied to the system."" Wow! I'm so smart!",1,Rick and Morty,128,24
2217,Jerry,1, But-,1,Rick and Morty,5,1
2218,Rick,1, I told the both of you school is stupid. It's not how you learn things. Morty's a gifted child. He has a special mind. That's why he's my little helper. He's like me. He's gonna be doing great science stuff later in his life. He's too smart for school. He needs to keep hanging out and helping me.,1,Rick and Morty,298,58
2219,Beth,1," Jerry, I don't want whatever's happening here to stop.",1,Rick and Morty,55,9
2220,Jerry,1," No, I-I understand. Uh, maybe we overreacted. But he has to keep going to school.",1,Rick and Morty,82,15
2221,Rick,1," Okay, Jerry. You drive a hard bargain, but what am I supposed to do? Say no? You you really wear the pants around here. I just want you to know, between us, from now on, it's gonna be clear communication.",1,Rick and Morty,205,40
2223,Summer,1, Frank Palicky was frozen to death today!,1,Rick and Morty,41,7
2224,Rick,1, No idea what you're talking about.,1,Rick and Morty,35,6
2226,Jerry,1," Okay. Well, uh, Morty, it's your bedtime in an hour. Don't stay up all night again. This is good, though. This can work. I think we can be a family and now, Beth, if you'll have me, I would love to have you.",1,Rick and Morty,208,43
2227,Beth,1, You know what? Okay.,1,Rick and Morty,21,4
2229,Morty,1," Holy cow, Rick. I didn't know hanging out with you was making me smarter.",1,Rick and Morty,74,14
2230,Rick,1," Full disclosure, Morty it's not. Temporary superintelligence is just a side effect of the mega seeds dissolving in your rectal cavity.",1,Rick and Morty,135,21
2231,Morty,1," Aw, man.",1,Rick and Morty,9,2
2232,Rick,1," Yeah, and once those seeds wear off, you're gonna lose most of your motor skills, and you're also gonna lose a significant amount of brain functionality for 72 hours, Morty. Starting right about now.",1,Rick and Morty,200,34
2233,Morty,1," Ohh, man.  Oh, geez! Ohh.",1,Rick and Morty,26,5
2235,Rick,1," I'm sorry, Morty. It's a bummer. In reality, you're as dumb as they come and I needed those seeds real bad, and I had to give them up just to get your parents off my back, so now we're gonna have to go get more",1,Rick and Morty,211,45
2236,Rick,1," And then we're gonna go on even more adventures after that, Morty and you're gonna keep your mouth shut about it, Morty, because the world is full of idiots that don't understand what's important, and they'll tear us apart, Morty but if you stick with me, I'm gonna accomplish great things, Morty, and you're gonna be part of them, and together, we're gonna run around, Morty. We're gonna do all kinds of wonderful things, Morty. Just you and me, Morty. The outside world is our enemy, Morty. We're the only friends we've got, Morty. It's just Rick and Morty. Rick and Morty and their adventures, Morty. Rick and Morty forever and forever. Morty's things. Me and Rick and Morty running around, and Rick and Morty time. All day long, forever.

2241,Rick,2,"*points out the window* See that planet right there? Don't fly too close to that planet. Someone'll come out and try to wash your windshield.  Hold on. *picks up* Yup. Yeah, I have it.

3914,Beth,5, How is praying going to help?,2,Rick and Morty,30,6

3944,Rick,5," I've seen enough of the galaxy to know that what we've got here is a Cromulon from the Cygnus-5 Expanse. So you can forget about nukes, and you can forget about math.  This head won't go away until *burp* Earth shows them it's got a hit song.",2,Rick and Morty,243,47
3950,Rick,5," No, Frasier. A live performance of a newly-written, catchy, original song. The Cromulon feed on the talent and showmanship of less-evolved lifeforms.",2,Rick and Morty,150,22
3954,Rick,5, You're gonna wanna put them on that giant speaker system at your sonic testing facility at Area 51.,2,Rick and Morty,100,18
3970,Rick,5," Good luck, Mr. President.",2,Rick and Morty,26,4
3978,Rick,5," I dabble, Mr. President.",2,Rick and Morty,25,4

4002,Rick,5," Who's NOT a musician, Morty?",2,Rick and Morty,29,5
4004,Morty,5, Me!,2,Rick and Morty,4,1
4006,Rick,5," Yeah, not with that attitude.",2,Rick and Morty,30,5
4010,Morty,5, B-b-but we don't have a song!,2,Rick and Morty,30,6
4022,Rick,5,"  All right, Morty, let's get ready to do it! Why don't you, uh, find a button on one of those keyboards and lay down some kind of beat?",2,Rick and Morty,136,28
4024,Morty,5," Rick, I think we need to cut our losses. We get our family and portal out of here!",2,Rick and Morty,83,18
4026,Rick,5," Morty! Good music comes from people who are relaxed. Just hit a button, Morty! Gimme a beat!",2,Rick and Morty,93,17
4028,Morty,5," Oh man, ok, all right, umÄ",2,Rick and Morty,27,6
4033,Rick,5, Ahhhhh yeahhhhh,2,Rick and Morty,16,2
4035,Rick,5, Ya gotta get schwifty,2,Rick and Morty,22,4

4076,Summer,5, Listen! The storm is stopping!,2,Rick and Morty,31,5
4081,Rick,5," Hey, take your pants off",2,Rick and Morty,25,5
4083,Rick,5, It's schwifty time today,2,Rick and Morty,25,4
4106,Beth,5," Now hold on a second, let's be rational about this.",2,Rick and Morty,52,10
4110,Beth,5," No, I'mÄ I'm just saying, we don't know if there's a cause-effect relationship --",2,Rick and Morty,82,14
4114,Beth,5," Oh, God, what's going on now?",2,Rick and Morty,30,6
4126,Rick,5, I think planet Earth has just been transported.,2,Rick and Morty,48,8
4132,Beth,5, Holy CRAP!,2,Rick and Morty,11,2
4136,Summer,5," Oh dear giant head, we apologize for that discussion! It will never happen again!",2,Rick and Morty,82,14
4150,Rick,5," Uhh, it's probably a bad time to mention it, but any astronauts you guys had in orbit are definitely dead.",2,Rick and Morty,107,20
4175,Morty,5, Like we're not already under enough pressure! ,2,Rick and Morty,47,7
4179,Rick,5," Geez, Morty. The guy's just doing his job. Take it easy.",2,Rick and Morty,57,11

4183,Rick,5," Genius happens in the moment, Morty. ",2,Rick and Morty,38,6
4185,Morty,5," Well, can we at least go get our family? You know, so we can take them with-with-with us if we lose?",2,Rick and Morty,101,21
4187,Rick,5," That's planning for failure, Morty. Even dumber than regular planning.  Balls.",2,Rick and Morty,79,11
4191,Rick,5," Morty, Morty, stop! Listen! There's only so much charge left in this thing. If we portal home from here and back, we're not gonna have enough charge left to get off-world. Get it?",2,Rick and Morty,180,33
4193,Morty,5, What?!,2,Rick and Morty,7,1
4195,Rick,5," Yeah, *burp* you see, I try to shelter you from certain realities, *burp* Morty. Cause if I let you make me nervous, then we can't get schwifty.",2,Rick and Morty,145,27

4221,Beth,5, We should pack up and leave town now.,2,Rick and Morty,38,8
4223,Jerry,5," I think it's inspiring that our community is coping with fear in a way that involves a festival and homemade ice cream. If you'd stop being such an evangelical atheist, you might start enjoying yourself.",2,Rick and Morty,204,35
4227,Jerry,5, Whoa! Look at you! You're wearing the hat and everything!,2,Rick and Morty,58,10
4229,Summer,5," Here's yours!  Mom, do you mind if I cook dinner tonight?",2,Rick and Morty,58,11
4231,Beth,5," Yeah, sure. Wait, what??",2,Rick and Morty,25,4
4233,Summer,5, I love you guys. You gave me life. And it's the will of the many heads that all children honor their parents.,2,Rick and Morty,110,22
4235,Beth,5, Dinner sounds nice.,2,Rick and Morty,20,3
4241,Summer,5," Father, can we please go to the Ascension?",2,Rick and Morty,43,8
4243,Jerry,5, Sure! Let's go to the Ascension. Wh-wh-what is it?,2,Rick and Morty,51,9
4249,Summer,5," Oh yes, yes! Rise to the giant head! You are free to be free!",2,Rick and Morty,62,14
4263,Rick,5," Wait, wait, wait! Come on, h-hold on a second!",2,Rick and Morty,47,9
4267,Morty,5, What?!,2,Rick and Morty,7,1
4271,Morty,5, That's it!,2,Rick and Morty,11,2
4275,Rick,5," Whoa, whoa! Morty! Give me that!",2,Rick and Morty,33,6
4277,Morty,5, You lied! You lied about the charge! You were just being lazy! Get back! Sit down!,2,Rick and Morty,83,16
4279,Rick,5," Morty, just put it down. You don't know what you're doing.",2,Rick and Morty,59,11

4295,Morty,5," Ahhh, sh**.",2,Rick and Morty,12,2
4299,Summer,5, And then Ethan played guitar and we learned the Seven Contemplations of the Head by singing them. It was really fun. Praise be the head!,2,Rick and Morty,137,25
4303,Jerry,5, Yeah.,2,Rick and Morty,6,1
4309,Summer,5, I'm going to start dinner! ,2,Rick and Morty,28,5
4311,Beth,5, I don't know what to say. Summer is doing really well here.,2,Rick and Morty,60,12
4313,Jerry,5," She's aced every test in potato class, and look how important potatoes have become.",2,Rick and Morty,84,14
4317,Beth,5, She's not getting pregnant or doing drugs or missing curfewÄ,2,Rick and Morty,61,10
4321,Beth,5, That's not our business as long as Summer is thriving!,2,Rick and Morty,55,10
4325,Summer,5, Taco time!  I hope it pleases you as the head desires.,2,Rick and Morty,55,11
4327,Beth,5," That's wonderful, Summer!",2,Rick and Morty,26,3
4329,Jerry,5," We're so proud of you. But honestly, you don't have to make dinner every night.",2,Rick and Morty,80,15
4331,Summer,5," Of course I do, silly!  Oh my God, daddy, I'm sorry I called you silly! I'm so sorry!  Heavenly head and cranial creator! Forgive my transgressions against family and community! May my chores complete me as I complete them!",2,Rick and Morty,224,39
4339,Morty,5, Birdperson?,2,Rick and Morty,12,1
4345,Rick,5," Wh-What do you think, Ice? Probably a little over-developed.",2,Rick and Morty,61,9
4349,Rick,5," Well, do you think maybe, could you give me some help with it, orÄ ?",2,Rick and Morty,69,15
4353,Rick,5," Ice, I don't want to be a negative Nelly or anything, but *burp* if Morty doesn't come back with my portal gun and I eat it out there, it's, uh, kind of your problem too.",2,Rick and Morty,171,35
4357,Rick,5, What? Why not?,2,Rick and Morty,15,3
4363,Rick,5, What the f***? You can turn into ice?,2,Rick and Morty,38,8
4367,Rick,5," Take it from me, Ice. *burp* You can't just *burp* float around space not caring about stuff forever.",2,Rick and Morty,102,18
4391,Morty,5," But can you help me get to my family? You know, at my house?",2,Rick and Morty,61,14
4395,Morty,5," All of Rick's moves are dick moves! Wh-what am I eating? What is this, bird seed?",2,Rick and Morty,82,16
4407,Morty,5," TammyÄ gross. Birdperson, you always stick up for Rick, but he doesn't care about anyone but himself. He doesn't think about the consequences of anything he does.",2,Rick and Morty,163,27
4413,Morty,5, What's that? Who's that baby?,2,Rick and Morty,30,5

4439,Beth,5, Absolutely not.,2,Rick and Morty,16,2
4443,Beth,5," We've been waiting 16 years for our daughter to respect us, but the key is, it has to be –our” daughter, not this person she's become.",2,Rick and Morty,135,26
4445,Jerry,5, We'll take our chances raising her without fancy new jobs outside of a potato-based religion.  And you know what? I'm sick of pretending that we're together because of the kids in the first place! I married you because you're the love of my life!,2,Rick and Morty,247,44
4447,Beth,5,"  And I•m lucky to have you and I never tell you that! You know, we will come out of this stronger as a family!",2,Rick and Morty,111,24
4451,Beth,5," Please don't do this, please don't do this! Summer!",2,Rick and Morty,52,9
4453,Jerry,5," Summer, listen carefully. I stole a paper clip and I have it in my cheek but I don't know what to do with it and it hurts.",2,Rick and Morty,123,27

4617,Beth,5, We should go get him.,2,Rick and Morty,22,5
4623,Morty,5, Sure thing! And I was kinda hoping that I could get a selfie with you?,2,Rick and Morty,71,15
