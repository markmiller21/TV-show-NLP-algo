13,1,2,A competent one.,Rick and Morty,Summer,16,3
15,1,2,Who cares about the *belch* thing you guys are talking about. The whole point of freezing time is to stop giving a f***. Put a shirt on your dumb dad and let's get this dumb universe rolling. Let's do this thing.,Rick and Morty,Rick,212,41
19,1,2,"Alright, listen you two, we froze time for a pretty long time, so when I unfreeze it, the world's time is gonna be fine, but our time's gonna need a little time to, you know, stabilize.",Rick and Morty,Rick,185,36
21,1,2,Our time is gonna be unstable? What does that even mean?,Rick and Morty,Morty,56,11
23,1,2,"It means relax and stop being a pussy, Morty. I thought you learned that by now. It also means don't touch your parents or we could shatter into countless theoretical shards.",Rick and Morty,Rick,174,31
25,1,2,"Wait a minute, what?",Rick and Morty,Morty,20,4
27,1,2,And away we go!,Rick and Morty,Rick,15,4
33,1,2,"Uh, did we ever put that mattress under Mr. Benson?",Rick and Morty,Morty,51,10
35,1,2,"Shhh, Morty!",Rick and Morty,Rick,12,2
39,1,2,"...A THING OR TWO ABOUT... wait, what? Was the house...? When we pulled up I could have sworn the house was completely trashed.",Rick and Morty,Jerry,127,23
41,1,2,"Negative visualization, Jerry. It explains a lot about where you're at. Hi, sweety.",Rick and Morty,Rick,83,13
43,1,2,"Hi, dad.",Rick and Morty,Beth,8,2
47,1,2,"Summer, Morty, are you okay?",Rick and Morty,Beth,28,5

51,1,2,"Yeah, we missed you so much. Too much to hug you though.",Rick and Morty,Summer,56,12
55,1,2,"Yeah it would literally destroy them. Now listen, why doi'why doi'whyi'why don't you guys go get a free sunday ice cream,  go out there and get some ice creams. Here's five hundred dollars cash in unmarked moneys. I'm just gonna put it on the floor and uh, kick it on over to ya. You guys go nuts.",Rick and Morty,Rick,297,57
57,1,2,"This better not be a bribe. If I find a single thing out of place in this house, my love of ice cream won't save you. I'll get my jacket.",Rick and Morty,Jerry,137,30
59,1,2,"Sweety, is your shirt on backwards?",Rick and Morty,Beth,35,6

75,1,2,Phew...,Rick and Morty,Morty,7,1
77,1,2, *Exhales*,Rick and Morty,Summer,10,1
81,1,2,Man that guy is the Red Grin Grumble to pretending he knows what's going on.,Rick and Morty,Jerry,76,15
85,1,2,"Oh you agree, huh?  You like that Red Grin Grumble reference?  Well guess what? I made him up. You really are your father's children. Think for yourselves, don't be sheep.",Rick and Morty,Rick,171,30
95,1,2,"God, I feel terrible.",Rick and Morty,Summer,21,4
97,1,2,"Yup, it really makes you appreciate how fickle the universe can be. One minute you're falling off a roof for six months, the next minute, bam!",Rick and Morty,Rick,142,26
101,1,2,"Uh, just to be clear, it was Summer's job to put the mattress under-",Rick and Morty,Morty,68,14

105,1,2,Nuh uh!,Rick and Morty,Morty,7,2
107,1,2,Yeah huh!,Rick and Morty,Summer,9,2
109,1,2,"Actually, sorry Summer, I gotta back the M bomb on this one. I remember the conversation. We told Morty to replace all the bank's money with cookies, your job was to put the mattress under Mr. Benson.",Rick and Morty,Rick,200,37
111,1,2,"Boom! In your face Summer! You really dropped the ball, man.",Rick and Morty,Morty,60,11
113,1,2,"Shut up Morty, you vindictive little turd!",Rick and Morty,Summer,42,7

141,1,2,What couldwedo?,Rick and Morty,Summer,15,2
143,1,2,"Wait, what am I saying?",Rick and Morty,Summer,23,5
145,1,2,*belch* Were either of you guys uncertain about anything just now?,Rick and Morty,Rick,66,11
147,1,2,Oh man... I don't feel good.,Rick and Morty,Morty,28,6
149,1,2,Am I me? I think so.,Rick and Morty,Morty,20,6
151,1,2,A-am I talking right now?,Rick and Morty,Morty,25,5
153,1,2,"Wait, who said that?",Rick and Morty,Morty,20,4
155,1,2,"Alright both of you, just don't move, don't speak, don't think. I have to check something.",Rick and Morty,Rick,90,16
157,1,2,What should we do Morty?,Rick and Morty,Summer,24,5

169,1,2,What's going on Rick?,Rick and Morty,Morty,21,4
171,1,2,What's happening Grampa?,Rick and Morty,Summer,24,3
173,1,2,Shut up!  Oh crap are you kidding me? Two dots? This never needs to be more than one dot. The two of you made us uncertain!,Rick and Morty,Rick,123,26
175,1,2,What do you mean?,Rick and Morty,Morty,17,4
177,1,2,What? In English?,Rick and Morty,Morty,17,3
179,1,2,What? English please?,Rick and Morty,Summer,21,3
181,1,2,What are you talking about?,Rick and Morty,Summer,27,5
183,1,2,Our time is fractured. You two somehow created a feedback loop of uncertainty that's split our reality into two equally possible impossiblities. W-we're exactly like a man capable of sustaining a platonic friendship with an attractive female co-worker. We're entirely hypothetical.,Rick and Morty,Rick,281,41
185,1,2,But I thought there were infinite timelines.,Rick and Morty,Morty,44,7
187,1,2,"We're not on any timeline, dummy. Look.",Rick and Morty,Rick,39,7
191,1,2,Oh my god!,Rick and Morty,Morty,10,3
193,1,2,Are those cats?,Rick and Morty,Summer,15,3
195,1,2,"I assume they're Schrodinger's cats. A-actually, I assume they both are and aren't, just like us.",Rick and Morty,Rick,97,16
199,1,2,ñMom and Dad?î Get your head out of your family's ass. The three of us are lost in a timeless oblivion. Your parents get to exist. They're probably living it up in some pointless grounded story about their sh*t marriage.,Rick and Morty,Rick,220,40
203,1,2,Cold Stone Creamery is the best. What should we do with ourremainingtwenty dollars?,Rick and Morty,Jerry,83,13
205,1,2,You realize they sing no matter how much you tip.,Rick and Morty,Beth,49,10
209,1,2,Holy sh*t! What happened?,Rick and Morty,Beth,25,4
211,1,2,I hit a deer! W-we have to tell the cops you were driving.,Rick and Morty,Jerry,58,13
213,1,2,W-what?,Rick and Morty,Beth,7,1
215,1,2,This is Rum Raisin!,Rick and Morty,Jerry,19,4
219,1,2,It's still alive.,Rick and Morty,Beth,17,3
221,1,2,"Well, do we- doIuh, get a big rock? Or-",Rick and Morty,Jerry,39,9
223,1,2,"It's not an armadillo, asshole!",Rick and Morty,Beth,31,5
225,1,2,"I thought that's what a man's supposed to say, it's not like I could have actually done it.",Rick and Morty,Jerry,91,18
227,1,2,"If we were near a hospital, I could treat it, but I-I think we have to just-",Rick and Morty,Beth,76,17
229,1,2,"It's okay, this is just something that happens. And even if we were in a hospital, what could we do, you're a horse surgeon, not a deer surgeon.",Rick and Morty,Jerry,144,28
231,1,2,So...,Rick and Morty,Beth,5,1
233,1,2,Well don't different animals-,Rick and Morty,Jerry,29,4
235,1,2,Require different levels of skill to keep alive?,Rick and Morty,Beth,48,8
237,1,2,Oh god...,Rick and Morty,Jerry,9,2
239,1,2,"Get the deer in the car, Jerry.",Rick and Morty,Beth,31,7
241,1,2,Yes Beth.,Rick and Morty,Jerry,9,2
245,1,2,"This is why you don't freeze time, you guys. It's incredibly irresponsible.",Rick and Morty,Rick,75,12
247,1,2,And you did it so you could clean the house after a party.,Rick and Morty,Morty,58,13
249,1,2,And you did it so you could clean the house after a party?,Rick and Morty,Morty,58,13
251,1,2,"Look, there's no time to hold me accountable, Morty. Like literally no time. Look around. Uncertainty is inherently unsustainable. Eventually everything either is or isn't. And we've got about four hours to be ñisî.",Rick and Morty,Rick,215,34
253,1,2,Or...,Rick and Morty,Morty,5,1
255,1,2,Or?,Rick and Morty,Morty,3,1
257,1,2,We ñisn'tî,Rick and Morty,Rick,10,2
259,1,2,"Alright, since this time crystal exists in both possibilities, and since it's impossible that I didn't nail this, I'm probably about to press this button in both possibilities at exactly the same time.",Rick and Morty,Rick,201,33
263,1,2,"Whatever you're asking, the answer is I'm amazing. And away we go!",Rick and Morty,Rick,66,12
267,1,2,"Huh, what do you know, it's working",Rick and Morty,Rick,35,7
269,1,2,"Ow, ow ouch!",Rick and Morty,Summer,12,3
271,1,2,"Whoa, ow, ow.",Rick and Morty,Morty,13,3
273,1,2,Oh sh*t.,Rick and Morty,Rick,8,2
277,1,2,What the hell is wrong with you two!? Ii'I mi'I mi'I mean you four!?,Rick and Morty,Rick,68,14
281,1,2,"Good I'm glad it was painful. You do deserve it! I saw you, you're both *belch* all over the damn place. We've been split for twenty minutes and your lives are already scattered to the quantum f***ing wind? What the hell do either of you have to be so uncertain about? Your brand of zit cream? Which chair to sit in while I do everything? Come on, spit it out!",Rick and Morty,Rick,360,70
283,1,2,"Well you don't exactly make it easy, Rick!",Rick and Morty,Morty,42,8
285,1,2,You make fun of me all the time and now Summer's doing it too!,Rick and Morty,Morty,62,14
287,1,2,You're always picking on me and now you got someone to kiss your ass!,Rick and Morty,Morty,69,14
289,1,2,Me? What about you? Would you get more excited to see me fail? You want Grampa all to yourself!,Rick and Morty,Summer,95,19
291,1,2,"Me? You're just as mean to me because you're jealous, because you want Grampa all to yourself!",Rick and Morty,Summer,94,17
293,1,2,"Alright, cool it, I see what's happening here. You're both young, you're both unsure about your place in the universe, you both wanna be ñGrampa's favorite.î I can fix this. Morty sit here, Summer, you sit here. Now listen, I know the two of you are very different from each other in a lot of ways, but you have to understand that as far as Grampa's concerned, you're both pieces of shit. Yeah, I can prove it mathematically. Actually, let me grab my whiteboard. This has been a long time coming anyway.",Rick and Morty,Rick,503,92
299,1,2,"Emergency, wounded deer coming in.",Rick and Morty,Beth,34,5
307,1,2,"I'm a certified horse surgeon, and this deer needs medical attention. Nurse, please move that snake.",Rick and Morty,Beth,100,16
311,1,2,"As a vet, I'm sure you know a deer is closer to a horse than you are to a doctor, so let's save the measuring for when our dicks are out, it's time to save a life!",Rick and Morty,Beth,163,37
317,1,2,"That's odd, this deer's wounded.",Rick and Morty,Beth,32,5
319,1,2,"Uh, yeah, I was there, you don't have to rub it in.",Rick and Morty,Jerry,51,12
321,1,2,I mean it's been shot. With a gun.,Rick and Morty,Beth,34,8
329,1,2,"*sigh* We don't have time for this, okay! I need anesthetic, and deer saline!",Rick and Morty,Beth,77,14
335,1,2,"In your dreams, bitch! Scalpel!",Rick and Morty,Beth,31,5
339,1,2,"So in conclusion, you're both equally mercurial, overly sensitive, clingy hysterical bird brained homunculi. And I honestly can't tell the two of you half the time because I don't go by height or age, I go by amount of pain in my ass, which makes you both identical. Alright, everything resolved? Everybody nice and certain about their position inmyworld?",Rick and Morty,Rick,355,59
343,1,2,"Alright, perfect. Sit still, *belch* arms down, I'm gonna do this again, this time, be like Grampa.",Rick and Morty,Rick,99,17
345,1,2,You mean drunk?,Rick and Morty,Morty,15,3
347,1,2,And away we go!,Rick and Morty,Rick,15,4
349,1,2,What's that? You got something to say?,Rick and Morty,Rick,38,7
351,1,2,No.,Rick and Morty,Morty,3,1
353,1,2,And away we go!,Rick and Morty,Rick,15,4
355,1,2,"Huh, that's weird. Oh my god.",Rick and Morty,Rick,29,6
357,1,2,What?,Rick and Morty,Summer,5,1
359,1,2,That son of a bitch is gonna kill me!,Rick and Morty,Rick,37,9
361,1,2,"Follicle unfeeling sociopath. Don't you get it? He thinks he can save his own skin by using the crystal to kill me. He probably figures it's easier to eliminate one of the possibilities rather than merge them. I have to admit, it's always in the back of my mind too. The difference is I would never do it! Until now...",Rick and Morty,Rick,318,60
363,1,2,"Don't you get it? don't you get it? The other Rick isn't trying to merge us anymore. He thinks he can save his own skin by using the crystal to kill me. He probably figures it's easier to eliminate one of the possibilities rather than merge them. I have to admit, it's always in the back of my mind too. The difference is I would never do it! Until now...",Rick and Morty,Rick,355,70
365,1,2,Rick what the hell are you doing?,Rick and Morty,Morty,33,7
367,1,2,Saving our lives. After he takes me out he's gonna be coming for you!,Rick and Morty,Rick,69,14
369,1,2,Who?,Rick and Morty,Summer,4,1
371,1,2,Me!,Rick and Morty,Rick,3,1
373,1,2,You see that? Get down.,Rick and Morty,Rick,23,5
375,1,2,Ahh!,Rick and Morty,Summer,4,1
377,1,2,Whoa whoa!,Rick and Morty,Morty,10,2
379,1,2,I told you he's a psycho!,Rick and Morty,Rick,25,6
381,1,2,He's lost it. The time fracture must have made him crazy!,Rick and Morty,Rick,57,11
383,1,2,I don't know what to do! I don't know what to do!,Rick and Morty,Rick,49,12
389,1,2,"Oh god, now there's three of them, we're outnumbered! Get in the cupboards! Wait, don't don't do that, they'll know... wait wait, think about getting in the cupboards but don't really. AAAAH IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT YOU SICK F***S? YOU WANNA SEE CHILDREN DIE?",Rick and Morty,Rick,256,45
393,1,2,"You son of a bitch, you don't stop living until I SAY SO!",Rick and Morty,Beth,57,13
405,1,2,She normally works on horses.,Rick and Morty,Jerry,29,5
407,1,2,"Jerry, if you're not gonna help, get the f*** out of here! I will reach into heaven and yank your screaming deer soul back!",Rick and Morty,Beth,123,24
413,1,2,"Shh shh... I know where you are, you creepy old monster... I know how you think! Oh, is this where you think I'm going? You think I'm standing here? Well maybe you're right!",Rick and Morty,Rick,173,33
417,1,2,"Holy sh*t, now what?",Rick and Morty,Summer,20,4
419,1,2,"Well if all of me knocked out all the Ricks, and you peed in all of your pants, doesn't that mean that we're all synchronized?",Rick and Morty,Morty,126,25
421,1,2,Right.,Rick and Morty,Summer,6,1
423,1,2,"Okay... so from now on, whatever we do we have to be certain.",Rick and Morty,Morty,61,13
425,1,2,Right...,Rick and Morty,Summer,8,1
427,1,2,I think I'm certain we're F'd in the A.,Rick and Morty,Morty,39,9
433,1,2,"Oh god, my head. What did you guys do?",Rick and Morty,Rick,38,9
435,1,2,"We put you in a dog crate because you were acting crazy, and you caused another time fracture.",Rick and Morty,Morty,94,18
437,1,2,You tried to kill yourself!,Rick and Morty,Summer,27,5
439,1,2,"Only in self defense, myself tried to kill me first! Guys, I don't expect you to understand this, but time breaking twice means our problem is two times bigger and we've got half as much time to solve it. Well actually, I do expect you to understand that, it's basic math. C-could someone just let me out of here? If I die in a cage I lose a bet.",Rick and Morty,Rick,346,69
441,1,2,Well is there some way you can prove you're not a threat to yourself and others anymore?,Rick and Morty,Summer,88,17
443,1,2,"Ah, for god's sake, alright here, give me the time crystal.",Rick and Morty,Rick,59,11
445,1,2,W-what're you doing?,Rick and Morty,Morty,20,3
447,1,2,"Calling myself. Here, listen, *belch* it'll probably go to voice mail since, you know, I'm calling myself.",Rick and Morty,Rick,106,17
451,1,2,"Don't fall for it, it's a bit.",Rick and Morty,Rick,30,7
455,1,2,"Hey Rick, it's Rick. Listen, I'm sorry about earlier. No hard feelings. I know you know I mean it too. Take it easy. Whoa. Damn, look at this, I'm blown up. Three new voicemails. *voicemail repeats* Yeah yeah, I heard this one. *voicemail repeats two more times* You get the idea *belch* we're cool now.",Rick and Morty,Rick,303,55
457,1,2,"Okay, well we're still not gonna let you out of this crate.",Rick and Morty,Summer,59,12
459,1,2,Fine I'll just do it myself.,Rick and Morty,Rick,28,6
461,1,2,If you could get out that whole time why didn't you?,Rick and Morty,Morty,52,11
463,1,2,"Because I waited until I was certain it was what I wanted to do, Morty. That's the difference between you and me. I'm certain, and you're a walking burlap sack filled with turds.",Rick and Morty,Rick,178,33
465,1,2,"You know, geez Rick, yi'yi'you're really tearing into me right now. You know, words hurt.",Rick and Morty,Morty,89,15
469,1,2,Oh my god!,Rick and Morty,Morty,10,3
471,1,2,It's a monster!,Rick and Morty,Morty,15,3
475,1,2,It's a monster!,Rick and Morty,Summer,15,3

505,1,2,"Yeah Grampa, way to go.",Rick and Morty,Summer,23,5
507,1,2,"Oh, what you're just gonna listen to this guy now? He's got a giant testicle for a head! He came here in a bubble. For all we know he could be the David Berkowitz of Nutsack Land.",Rick and Morty,Rick,179,37
531,1,2,"Yes, we're back, problem solved.",Rick and Morty,Rick,32,5
533,1,2,"Yes, we're back to our own time.",Rick and Morty,Summer,32,7
535,1,2,"Yes no more cats, no more cats, oh you did it, you fixed it.",Rick and Morty,Morty,60,14
539,1,2,How long exactly do we have to wear these things? They're really embarassing.,Rick and Morty,Rick,77,13
543,1,2,Time prison?,Rick and Morty,Summer,12,2
547,1,2,You stole a time freezing crystal from testical monsters?,Rick and Morty,Summer,57,9
549,1,2,"I would have been happy to pay for it, Summer, but they don't exactly sell them at Costco.Besides, there's a larger lesson to be learned here. Get him!",Rick and Morty,Rick,151,28
557,1,2,Isn't there a kitten somewhere that needs a manicure?,Rick and Morty,Beth,53,9
561,1,2,"Honey, it's gonna be okay. These men are from the Cervine Institute of Elk, Moose Deer and Stag. They can take this deer to a helicopter and fly it to the country's top deer surgeon on a wildlife reserve across the state border, where your jurisdiction ends.",Rick and Morty,Jerry,258,47
567,1,2,We did it...,Rick and Morty,Jerry,12,3
573,1,2,Why are you doing this?,Rick and Morty,Morty,23,5
577,1,2,What if I told you there's a huge ticket up right behind you?,Rick and Morty,Rick,61,13
581,1,2,"Alright, hear me out on this. You're immortal, right, which means your life is infinite. Well in that case there's 100% chance that you'll eventually do everything,includingturning around to look behind you.",Rick and Morty,Rick,207,32
587,1,2,"Ah, god, gross and weird!",Rick and Morty,Rick,25,5
597,1,2,"Summer, Morty, take off your collars!",Rick and Morty,Rick,37,6
601,1,2,Good question. I suppose the answer is,Rick and Morty,Rick,38,7
607,1,2,I have no idea!,Rick and Morty,Rick,15,4
609,1,2,I'm not sure.,Rick and Morty,Rick,13,3
653,1,2,"Look, I know I was kind of a nuisance today. I know it's my fault we hit the deer, and I know you wanted to be the one to save it.",Rick and Morty,Jerry,130,31
655,1,2,Whatever. How petty would I have to be to care less about an animal's life than my own ego?,Rick and Morty,Beth,91,19
657,1,2,Hmm... you'd have to be pretty petty. But you'd still be the woman I married.,Rick and Morty,Jerry,77,15
659,1,2,Where are we going?,Rick and Morty,Beth,19,4
661,1,2,One last stop.,Rick and Morty,Jerry,14,3
663,1,2,Where's the helicopter?,Rick and Morty,Beth,23,3
665,1,2,"There is no helicopter, and there is no Cervine Institute.",Rick and Morty,Jerry,58,10

2229,1,1," Holy cow, Rick. I didn't know hanging out with you was making me smarter.",Rick and Morty,Morty,74,14

4223,5,2," I think it's inspiring that our community is coping with fear in a way that involves a festival and homemade ice cream. If you'd stop being such an evangelical atheist, you might start enjoying yourself.",Rick and Morty,Jerry,204,35
