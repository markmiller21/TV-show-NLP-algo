5040,1,15," You're right. Victoria, I'm sorry I haven't told you this yet, but a while back, I was kind of into Robin. In fact, on our first date, I might have said, ""I love you."" Understandably, she freaked out and I left. But unfortunately, the night did not end there.",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,260,49

5064,1,15," Hi, Shannon.",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,13,2
5066,1,15," Just listen. When you left me for that guy Greg, it changed me. Now I'm this. I-I know this is crazy. It's just, you were once such a big part of my life. And it just seemed insane that you didn't know who I am now. So here I am. And then she told me about her life.",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,267,58
5068,1,15, She and Greg dated for a while and then split up. But here's the real kicker,How I Met Your Mother,Barney,77,16

5070,1,15," My life rocks! Money, suits and s*x. These are tears of joy! I could be cooped up in some tiny apartment changing some brat's poopy diapers. But instead, I'm out in the world being awesome 24-7, 365! You let me dodge a bullet, Big Guy. Plus, here's the mini-cherry on top of the regular cherry on top of the sundae of awesomeness that is my life. After Shannon and I talked, I nailed her.",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,389,74

5093,1,16, So wear another one.,How I Met Your Mother,Barney,21,4
5094,1,16, I don't have another one. I'm flat broke. My only other suit options are track or birthday.,How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,92,17
5095,1,16," Dude, you show up to an interview in that, even the hippie lawyers from Granola Mountain Earth Pals will hackey sack you straight out the door.",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,144,26
5096,1,16," Okay, it's the National Resource Defense Council, and it's my dream job. Except it's only an internship, and I won't be getting paid. Mostly getting people coffee. But the people I'm getting coffee for... their bosses are going to save the world.",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,247,42

5112,1,16, Really? That'd be great.,How I Met Your Mother,Lily,25,4
5114,1,16," Hey, I thought it was going to be just us tomorrow. What's with inviting Punky Brewster?",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,89,16
5115,1,16," Robin, you've got to get over this Ted and Victoria thing. You had your chance, and now he's moved on. Can't you just be happy for them?",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,137,27
5116,1,16, The best I can give you is a fake smile and dead eyes.,How I Met Your Mother,Robin,55,13

5128,1,16," Mm-hmm. And if you do, what does that mean for us?",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,51,11
5130,1,16," Oh, God, no. Long-distance is a lie teenagers tell each other to get laid the summer before college.",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,101,18
5132,1,16," Either you stay here, or we break up. Wow. Um, look, let's just see how things progress, and if by September, we still feel...",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,127,24
5134,1,16," Monday, September the...?",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,26,3
5136,1,16, Maybe we should each take some time to think about what we want. We'll meet up tomorrow to discuss it.,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,103,20
5140,1,16," Hey, baby, how's the dress place?",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,34,6
5141,1,16, Everything's so fluffy and white. It's like shopping in a marshmallow. How's Barney's tailor?,How I Met Your Mother,Lily,94,14
5142,1,16," Um, everything here is dark and sketchy and seems illegal. It's like shopping in Barney's mind.",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,96,16
5143,1,16," Well, good luck, baby.",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,23,4
5144,1,16," Bye. Hey, Barney, I'm not sure about this. A tailor in the back room of a pet store?",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,85,18
5145,1,16," Look, do you want a quality suit and a free rabbit or not? Ted, Sergei says stop moping around. You're distracting him from his process.",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,137,25
5146,1,16, You speak Ukrainian?,How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,21,3
5147,1,16," Guys, I'm kind of screwed here. I don't want to lose Victoria, but I can't ask her to stay just for me. And long distance definitely isn't an option.",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,150,29
5148,1,16," No. No, no, no. No way. You know who likes long distance? Girls. It's all talking and no s*x. Kill me now.",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,107,22
5149,1,16, Don't knock long-distance relationships. I really think they can work.,How I Met Your Mother,Barney,71,10
5150,1,16, Really? You?,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,13,2
5151,1,16," Absolutely. I'm juggling four right now. There's Lisa in Madrid, there's Erica in Tokyo, there's Laura in Denmark, and Kelly on 34th Street. The lass thinks I'm a humble sheep shearer from Killarney.",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,200,33
5152,1,16," Ted, do you remember in college when Lily did that summer art program in Paris?",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,80,15
5153,1,16, Yeah.,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,6,1
5154,1,16," Well, she kept talking about this cheesy French guy, Gabriel. So, I went out to visit, and there was this party. And who shows up but Gabriel. And he's got this weak-ass, thin French moustache. I'm not much of a fighter, but I knew I could take this weird little dude. So, I took him aside, and I got all creepy quiet, I got the crazy eyes going, and I said, ""You stay away from Lily, or I swear to God I'll eat that moustache right off of your ugly French face."" Yeah. Yeah, he literally ran away. I think he was crying. I never told Lily about it. To be honest, I'm not very proud of it. To be even more honest, I am.",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,620,125
5155,1,16," Um, other than confirming a lot of European stereotypes about Americans, did that little story have a point?",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,109,18
5156,1,16," Yeah, the point is that even though Lily is my soul mate, long distance still almost killed us. If you think that there's any chance that Victoria is your soul mate, you should ask her to stay.",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,194,37
5157,1,16," Well, I don't know if she is. It's still so early, but yeah, she could be.",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,75,16
5158,1,16," Oh, please. You barely know this girl. What's her favorite color? Is she a cat person or a dog person? Is she open to a three-way? Ted, I do more research than this before buying a cell phone. FYI, yes, I have three-way calling.",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,229,44
5159,1,16," Look, she can't be a cat person. I'm a dog person, I'm attracted to other dog people.",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,86,17
5160,1,16, Are you sure?,How I Met Your Mother,Barney,14,3
5161,1,16, All right. ,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,12,2
5163,1,16," Hey, random question. How do you feel about cats?",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,50,9
5165,1,16," Good to know. Um, okay. Good-bye.  She's a cat person. I don't know this girl at all.",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,86,17
5166,1,16," Oh, excellent. We'll take this one.",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,36,6
5167,1,16," Whoa. Hey, hey, it's my suit. Shouldn't I be the one to choose?",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,64,13

5169,1,16, God. I'm going to look hot.,How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,28,6
5170,1,16," Marshall, I can't let you waste a suit this nice fighting a losing battle for our planet's survival. This is a suit for winners. I am getting you an interview at my office. We need good men like you in our legal department. We get sued a lot.",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,243,48
5171,1,16, No way. The Kid does not sell out.,How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,35,8
5172,1,16," Oh, come on, dude! Three months working with me, you'll make more than Lily makes in a year.",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,93,18
5173,1,16, No. I've made my decision.,How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,27,5
5174,1,16," So have I. If I ask this girl to give up her dreams for me, and two weeks later, it's not working out, I'm, like, the biggest jerk of all time. It's just too much pressure on a new relationship. I'm going to tell her to go.",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,224,47
5178,1,16, I want you to stay.,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,20,5
5180,1,16, Everything here is dark and sketchy and seems illegal. It's like shopping in Barney's mind.,How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,92,15
5181,1,16," Oh, good luck, baby.",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,21,4
5182,1,16, Bye.,How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,5,1
5184,1,16, Nothing too huge or-or poofy. I'm not really a girlie girl. But I would like to look like a beautiful princess.,How I Met Your Mother,Lily,112,21
5185,1,16, I saw a couple up front that were nice.,How I Met Your Mother,Robin,40,9
5187,1,16, Where does she get off? She doesn't know how much money I make.,How I Met Your Mother,Lily,64,13
5189,1,16, Damn you Old Navy and your reasonably-priced three-packs!,How I Met Your Mother,Lily,58,8
5191,1,16, And cake.,How I Met Your Mother,Robin,10,2
5193,1,16," Speaking of which, Victoria, have you decided what to do about your doughnut fellowship?",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,89,14
5195,1,16, Ugh. All talking and no s*x. Kill me now.,How I Met Your Mother,Lily,42,9
5197,1,16," Well, I don't know. I'd feel a little Stepford turning down a huge opportunity to chase some guy I'd only known two months.",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,124,23
5199,1,16," Yeah, in America, but German guys? Whew! I would let them bread my schnitzel any day, if you know what I mean.",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,111,22
5201,1,16," s*x. Oh, excuse me, ma'am. This b*st*rd's kicked.",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,50,8
5204,1,16," It's okay, guys, I hate it.",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,28,6
5206,1,16," It's bad, it's really bad. Short in front, long in the back? That is the mullet of wedding dresses.",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,100,19
5207,1,16," You know, Victoria, Marshall and I did long distance once. In college, I did an art course in Paris. I was the only American there. It was really lonely. I only had one friend, Gabrielle. She was kind of homely and strange-looking, and she was really self-conscious about this little moustache she had. Anyway, halfway through the semester, she just stopped talking to me, and I never figured out why. And then I had nobody. The only thing that got me through was knowing that my soul mate was back at home waiting for me. If Ted's your soul mate, then it may be worth it to hang onto him.",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,590,110
5209,1,16," Hey, random question",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,21,3
5211,1,16, A cat person. Why am I not surprised?,How I Met Your Mother,Robin,38,8
5213,1,16, Maybe he's going to buy you one.,How I Met Your Mother,Lily,33,7
5215,1,16, Maybe he's using an adorable kitty to guilt you into staying.,How I Met Your Mother,Robin,62,11
5217,1,16," Oh, I wouldn't even wait to find out. I would be on the next plane to Germany.",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,79,17
5219,1,16," Oh, God, you guys are sucky liars.",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,35,7
5220,1,16," Ugly, ugly, ugly.",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,18,3
5222,1,16, Are you okay?,How I Met Your Mother,Lily,14,3
5223,1,16, I'm fine.,How I Met Your Mother,Robin,10,2
5224,1,16, Okay. Just kind of seemed like you're trying to hustle Victoria out of the country.,How I Met Your Mother,Lily,84,15
5225,1,16," I'm not, I'm just trying to support her. She got a super-important dessert scholarship.",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,88,14
5226,1,16," Stop being sarcastic. It is a super-important dessert scholarship. Wow, that's hard to say without sounding sarcastic. Look... I know you're not Victoria's biggest fan, but she seems to make Ted happy. So think about that before you use your miles to buy her a plane ticket.",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,275,47
5228,1,16," Oh, my gosh, it's perfect! Oh! This dress is totally going to get me laid on my wedding night.",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,95,19
5230,1,16, I know what you mean.,How I Met Your Mother,Robin,22,5
5232,1,16," Well, I'm always putting my career ahead of my relationships, and... to be honest, there's a lot of lonely nights in that job description.",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,139,24
5234,1,16, Choosing Ted over your career doesn't make you un-feminist. Maybe it just means that you guys would be happy together.,How I Met Your Mother,Robin,119,20
5236,1,16," Oh, no way... you're the coolest.",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,34,6
5238,1,16," Okay, I am.",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,12,3
5241,1,16," Oh, I am so beautiful! Oh, don't tell me how much it costs. Just snap my neck now, so I can die this pretty.",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,109,24
5242,1,16," Wow, you look incredible.",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,26,4
5243,1,16," Oh. Okay, okay, how much is it, on a scale of never to never ever?",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,67,15
5244,1,16," Never ever, ever, ever, ever... times infinity.",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,48,7
5245,1,16," Well, it's okay. You know, what makes a bride beautiful is that she's just happy to be getting married.  Oh, guys, I know I look amazing, but the important thing is that Marshall and I love each other, right?",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,209,39
5246,1,16," Yes, you're right. But also... you just sat down in the cake.",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,62,12
5248,1,16," Okay. Come on, get up, let us see how bad it is.",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,49,12
5250,1,16, It was like this when I found it?,How I Met Your Mother,Lily,34,8
5252,1,16, Credit card... s.,How I Met Your Mother,Lily,18,3

5834,1,18," It could happen. And so really, what's it gonna matter in 50 years if I jump the gun by one night? Look, I-I know this is a moral gray area, but... It's Robin. And I'm exhausted. I am. I'm exhausted from pretending I'm not in love with her. I think that makes this okay.",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,271,54
5836,1,18," Yes, I do. You got me. That is exactly what I want right now. And so what? I want this. She wants this. It's happening, and if you have a problem with it, don't be in Germany.

5858,1,19, You lied and said you were broken up with Victoria before you actually were so you could try to nail Robin and you wound up losing both girls in one night?,How I Met Your Mother,Barney,156,31

5876,1,19, No! It's illegal. And did I mention gross?,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,43,8
5877,1,19," That's adorable. Ted, you're such a hayseed. The companionship business is the growth industry of the 21st century. You do realize that one out of every eight adult women in America is a prostitute.",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,199,34
5878,1,19, You just made that up.,How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,23,5

5884,1,19," Much obliged. 57 days?! Ted, you are in a slump.",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,49,10
5885,1,19," No, it's not a slump. It's an intentional hiatus from girls. A slump is when you strike out every time you step up to the plate. But I'm off the roster, baby. I'm in the locker room sitting in the whirlpool. And I'll tell you something, it feels pretty good.",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,259,50
5886,1,19," Yeah, you know what else is in that locker room? A naked dudes hanging brain. Ted, you need a lady. And I've got the next best thing-- Mary. She lives in my building. She's smart, she's hot, she's totally cool.",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,211,40

5888,1,19, You want to judge a fellow human being based solely on one external characteristic? That's racism. And I do not drink with racists. Good day.,How I Met Your Mother,Barney,142,25

6316,1,20," No, you won't.",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,15,3
6318,1,20," No, you won't accomplish anything you set out to. You'll get a girlfriend the first day of college and you'll give up your independence and you'll never live abroad and you'll wind up old before your time wondering ""Whatever happened to my hopes and my dreams?""",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,262,46

6341,1,20, I can't believe I unloaded like that on a high school senior.,How I Met Your Mother,Lily,62,12
6342,1,20," I can't believe a high school senior unloaded like that on me. I'm going to ask you something and, um, maybe it's crazy 'cause you guys are the cutest couple ever. But, um, are you having second thoughts?",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,205,38
6343,1,20, Yeah. But not about Marshall. About me. I just keep thinking about the girl I was ten years ago and wondering what happened to her.,How I Met Your Mother,Lily,132,25
6345,1,20," I don't want to be tied down. I want to live in France and Spain and Italy and just soak up life and put it on a canvas, even if it means being a waitress in crappy caf̩s for five years, I don't care. I'm going to be a painter. And I can't do any of that with a, with a boyfriend shackled around my neck, you know? But anyway, I'm blabbering. Way to make new friends, Lily. I'm sorry.

6437,1,21, That's not hard. I know at least...,How I Met Your Mother,Lily,36,7
6438,1,21," I'm not done. She likes dogs, Otis Redding, does the crossword. She's into sports, but not so much so that her legs are, like, more muscular than mine. That weirds me out. And she plays bass guitar like Kim Deal from the Pixies.",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,229,43

6441,1,21, You're never going to find this girl.,How I Met Your Mother,Lily,38,7

6443,1,21," So, what, you think fate's just going to take care of it?",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,58,12

6473,1,21, What?,How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,6,1
6474,1,21," Butterfield is going to retaliate within the next four hours. That's been his pattern. This is war, Eriksen. I need you to clear your schedule, call Lily, tell her you'll be home late.",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,185,33
6475,1,21, This is stupid.,How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,16,3
6476,1,21," Stu... Come on, man, I didn't recruit you to work here for your lawyering skills. I recruited you to be my executive mischief consultant.",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,138,24
6477,1,21," This is a job for me, Barney. It's a way to make some extra wedding money, and that's it. Now I'm sorry, but I have work to do.",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,128,28
6478,1,21," Tracy, could you come in here, please? Would you please inform Mr. Eriksen that I'm no longer speaking to him.",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,111,20

6486,1,21," Uh, yeah. You guys never found me a match.",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,43,9

6491,1,21, So I'm in good hands. You found me a match?,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,44,10

6498,1,21," You wanted to see me, so I guess that means we're talking again?",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,65,13
6499,1,21, Will you taste this latte for me? I think they gave me decaf.,How I Met Your Mother,Barney,62,13
6500,1,21, Tastes normal to me.,How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,21,4
6501,1,21," That's what I thought, too. Then I got this e-mail from Butterfield.",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,69,12
6502,1,21," Oh, God!",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,9,2

6505,1,21, Because now... you're in.,How I Met Your Mother,Barney,26,4
6506,1,21, Okay. Don't think I'm overlooking the obvious fact that I should just be mad at you. But Executive Mischief Consultant Marshall Eriksen reporting for duty. Let's make that b*st*rd pay. You think that we should brush our teeth first?,How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,233,39
6507,1,21," Yeah, it's probably a good idea.",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,33,6

6515,1,21, What? What? No. Can't you just call Marshall?,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,46,8
6516,1,21," Marshall can't know about this. Look, Ted, it's dark, I don't know how to change a tire, and I've stumbled into the beginning of a very scary campfire story. Can you please hurry?",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,180,33
6517,1,21," I can't, I'm waiting...",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,24,4
6518,1,21," Oh, my God, is that a drifter with a hook for a hand? No, drifter, no!",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,71,16
6519,1,21," Come on, Lily.",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,15,3

6521,1,21," All right, stay there. I'm on my way.",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,38,8

6525,1,21, Yes.,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,5,1
6526,1,21, And was she okay about pushing it back?,How I Met Your Mother,Lily,40,8
6527,1,21, Yes. Because she's perfect. So what am I doing here?,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,53,10
6528,1,21, You can never tell Marshall.,How I Met Your Mother,Lily,29,5
6529,1,21, I won't.,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,9,2
6530,1,21, Ever. Swear. Swear on the lives of your unborn boy and girl.,How I Met Your Mother,Lily,61,12
6531,1,21, I swear on Luke and Leia.,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,26,6
6532,1,21," About a month ago, I started getting insomnia. Marrying Marshall had been all I wanted for a long time. But, now that it was really happening, it seemed kind of huge and scary.",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,177,33
6533,1,21, Did you talk to Marshall about it?,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,35,7
6534,1,21," He wouldn't have understood. He's not exactly nervous about tying the knot. So I spent my nights reading, painting, setting the high score on Super Bomber Man...",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,162,27
6535,1,21, That was you? Awesome!,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,23,4
6536,1,21," I know! I just got in the zone and... Not the point of the story. And then I started thinking about Victoria and how she followed her dream to Germany, and I found that art fellowship.",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,185,36
6537,1,21, Let me guess. It's somewhere far away.,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,39,7
6538,1,21," San Francisco. But it's not like I'm going to do it. The dates conflict with the wedding. But I love painting, and I've always wondered if I'm any good. This was a way to find out. And the interview is tonight. In New Haven.",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,225,44
6539,1,21, You don't want to get married.,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,31,6
6540,1,21, Of course I want to get married. I... It's not like I was ever going to do it. I just... I just really wanted to see if I could get this.,How I Met Your Mother,Lily,138,31
6541,1,21," Lily, we live in the center of art and culture in America. I'm sure you could find a program here that's just as selective. But you chose one in a city 3,000 miles away, and you didn't tell Marshall. I think it's pretty clear what that means.",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,243,47
6542,1,21," Okay, I was... I was having second thoughts. But I'm not any more. I... I mean, this flat tire was a sign. I'm not supposed to do this. I'm supposed to go home and-and be with Marshall. You must think I'm so stupid.",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,216,43
6543,1,21, I don't think you're stupid.,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,29,5
6544,1,21, I love Marshall.,How I Met Your Mother,Lily,17,3
6545,1,21, I know you do. Come here. It's okay. Look... Marriage is big. You're allowed to freak out.,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,91,17
6546,1,21, But why am I the only one? How come Marshall isn't doing anything crazy?,How I Met Your Mother,Lily,73,14
6549,1,21, So all we need is one large shipping box and 100 white mice.,How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,61,13
6551,1,21, All done.,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,10,2
6552,1,21," Ted, let's go to New Haven.",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,28,6
6553,1,21," Lily, don't do this to yourself.",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,33,6
6554,1,21," I just need to know if I can get in. If I do this interview, and get into the program, then I'll know, and I can forget all about it, and get married. Come on! It's an adventure.",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,179,38
6555,1,21," No, it's not an adventure. It's a mistake.",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,43,8
6556,1,21," Okay, yes, it's a mistake. I know it's a mistake. But there are certain things in life where you know it's a mistake but you don't really know it's a mistake because the only way to really know it's a mistake is to make the mistake, and look back, and say, ""Yep. That was a mistake."" So, really, the bigger mistake would be to not make the mistake, because then you go your whole life not really knowing if something is a mistake or not. And, damn it, I've made no mistakes! I've done all of this-- my life, my relationship, my career-- mistake-free. Does any of this make sense to you?",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,587,112

6681,1,22," So what's this big, beautiful romantic gesture?",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,48,7

7002,2,1," Barney, I really don't think this is gonna help.",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,49,9
7003,2,1," Do you know why you're not over Lily yet? It's 'cause you can still picture her naked. You can't get over a woman until you can no longer picture her boobs. It's a scientific fact.

7791,2,4, And then it got ugly.,How I Met Your Mother,Robin,22,5
7793,2,4," What I don't do is tell you the same story over and over again. I mean, you wouldn't watch the same movie over and over again, would you? Maybe a great movie like Die Hard. But Field of Dreams? Once is more than enough.",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,220,44

7806,2,4," No, I mean, I guess I don't know how to do this girlfriend thing. I've never been in a relationship this serious before. I should probably go tell him I'm sorry, shouldn't I? You're trying to do it right now, aren't you?",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,221,42
7807,2,4," What the hell comes before ""Q""?",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,32,6

7817,2,4, Robin thinks so.,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,17,3

7820,2,4," I'm telling you, you should use the architect angle with the ladies.",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,69,12
7821,2,4," Okay, first of all, I have a girlfriend. Second, the architect angle doesn't even work on her. And, third, I can't imagine that working on anyone ever.",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,152,27
7822,2,4," That's 'cause you're always like...  ""Ted Mosby, architect"". If it were me, I'd be like...  ""Ted Mosby, architect"". Anything sounds impressive when it's said with the right attitude.",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,183,28
7823,2,4," Marshall Ericksen. Recently dumped and heading to a lame party. Whoa. Whoa, ladies, please take it easy. There's enough of me for everyone. Oh. Hi. Hello. All right. We're gonna take off..",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,189,32
7824,2,4," Wait up, I'll leave with you guys. ""Ted Mosby, architect"". Trust me.",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,69,12
7826,2,4," Hey, just out of curiosity. If a guy told you he was an architect, what would you think of that?",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,97,20
7828,2,4, Solid point. She did have hair of gold.,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,40,8
7830,2,4, Mm-hmm.,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,8,1

7844,2,4," Well, you know, soul of an artist, hands of a master craftsman. It was inevitable, I guess.",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,92,17
7846,2,4," Well, I could try, but you might end up looking like a midcentury tri-level. Hey, if you want, my friend Marshall invited me to this party we could all go to. Marshall's great. He's just a lawyer, but somebody has to push the paper around for us creative types. Am I right?",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,274,52
7849,2,4," He asked her to a party. Oh, my God, are you okay?",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,51,12
7850,2,4," Okay? It's awesome. It's a win-win. Ted got to vent and I don't have to hear it. Maybe after he's done with the talkie-talk, he'll come over and I'll get the fun part.",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,168,33
7851,2,4," What is wrong with you? God, I feel like I'm teaching love as a second language here. Okay, you know how when he tells you boring work stories you're supposed to listen? Well, when he picks up some random girl at a bar, you're supposed to freak out.",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,250,48
7852,2,4," I'm not freaking out because in my mind, she's fat.",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,52,10
7854,2,4," All right, we'll swing by the party.",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,37,7
7857,2,4," Damn, these are some drunk almost-lawyers.",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,43,6
7860,2,4," Okay, where are the guys and the hooker?",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,41,8
7862,2,4," Hey, drunk legal dude, um... Have you seen Marshall Ericksen? He was with a guy named Ted.",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,91,17
7865,2,4," Awards are nice, they look good on my shelf. But none of that acclaim means anything compared to the joy of seeing the sun rise over your first building.",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,154,29
7867,2,4, I know you would. It's the job.,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,32,7
7871,2,4," I didn't want to ruin the party for everybody this early, but, uh... everyone take a seat. Um... Lily actually called off the wedding this summer to go to San Francisco. So... We're broken up.",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,193,35
7873,2,4," Yeah, that's not really the part I was worried about, guys.",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,60,11
7875,2,4," Guys, can we cease and desist with the lawyer speak for a minute? Love died. The love that made you all believe in love, that's dead now.",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,138,27
7877,2,4," Uh, really? On what ground, Kara?",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,34,6
7881,2,4, See? Marshall's still hung up on our breakup. Why? Because I listened to him. It was a strong and nurturing relationship that I threw away like old gum.,How I Met Your Mother,Lily,153,28
7882,2,4," Not that I'm worried or anything, but, um, back to the sun rising over Ted and, uh... Oh, what tasteful way did you describe her?",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,130,25
7884,2,4," Yes, that's the young lady.",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,28,5
7888,2,4," Yeah, okay. There is no way Ted went dancing. Ted hates clubs.",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,63,12
7890,2,4," Hell, yeah. I love clubs. I mean, I was going to design a cathedral tonight, kind of take a whack at the whole relationship between God and man conundrum. But sure, let's go dancing.",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,183,34
7892,2,4," Wait, let me just check with my friend.",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,40,8
7894,2,4," Hey, Marshall. You up for some super loud, repetitive music that hasn't changed since the mid-90s?",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,99,16
7895,2,4, Um... only always.,How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,19,3
7896,2,4, Let's go.,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,10,2
7898,2,4," Dancing? He went dancing with this girl? Okay, maybe this is a little bad. Dancing is bad. Dancing leads to s*x.",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,113,21
7899,2,4, Did you grow up in that Footloose town?,How I Met Your Mother,Lily,40,8
7900,2,4," I'm calling him. I'm telling him that I was wrong and I'm sorry, and I totally want to listen to his stupid stories.",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,117,23
7901,2,4," Yeah, think of another way to phrase that and you'll be fine.",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,62,12
7902,2,4, He's not answering. Calling Marshall.,How I Met Your Mother,Robin,38,5
7905,2,4, Hello.,How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,7,1
7906,2,4," Marshall, hi, it's Robin. Can I talk to Ted?",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,45,9

The cougar keeps up with current hairstyles as a form of camouflage. The prey may not realize that he's engaged a cougar until he's already being dragged, helpless, back to her lair. Now, the blouse. The cougar displays maximum cleavage possible to captivate her prey. If you're watching them bounce, she's about to pounce. See the claws? Long and sharp, to ward off rival females...

8432,2,6, What does his ball have to do with anything?,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,45,9
8433,2,6," Druthers has to be taught he can't behave like that. When I was teaching kindergarten,whenever a kid was mean, I would take away one of his toys. The kid would be upset at first,but then he'd learn to stop being mean.",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,218,41

8444,2,6, So is being mean.,How I Met Your Mother,Lily,18,4
8445,2,6," Lily, your little system doesn't even make sense. In kindergarten, the kid knew why he was being punished. Druthers just thinks someone stole his ball.",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,152,25
8446,2,6," Well, that's why I left a note.",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,32,7
8447,2,6, A note?,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,8,2
8448,2,6," Yeah. When he finds it, he'll understand why his ball was taken away, he'll stop being mean, and the office will be a nicer place to work. Maybe he'll even be open to hearing your ideas.",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,187,36

8464,2,6," When Druthers goes to get his bagel, I'll go in, grab the note, put the ball back. If something goes wrong, yell out, ""who wants espresso?"" So I'll know he's coming. Got it? Okay, now give me the ball.",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,202,39

8477,2,6," No, they're not. It's just a tantrum, Ted. I saw this in kindergarten all the time.",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,84,16
8478,2,6," This isn't kindergarten. Mr Druthers is an adult, and he wants his ball back.",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,78,14
8479,2,6," All right, I'll give it back if you show him your plans.",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,57,12

8490,2,6, I can't stop thinking about you. Please give me another chance.,How I Met Your Mother,Barney,64,11
8492,2,6," But you don't understand. See, I've been going easy on you, holding back, 'cause I was afraid you'd break a hip or something. But, this time, no mercy.I don't care how long it takes days, weeks, half a year.",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,208,39

8589,2,7," Dude, that is cold-blooded.",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,28,4

8630,2,7," Okay, let's take a look. Oh, yeah, it's a cougar all right. A prime specimen. See, you can identify a cougar by a few key characteristics. Start with the hair. The cougar keeps up with current hairstyles as a form of camouflage. The prey may not realize that he's engaged a cougar until he's already being dragged, helpless, back to her lair. Now, the blouse. The cougar displays maximum cleavage possible to captivate her prey. If you're watching them bounce, she's about to pounce. See the claws? Long and sharp, to ward off rival females... Or open alimony checks. Yeah, this one's a beaut. Okay, let the hunt begin.",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,620,109

8644,2,7, It's nothing.,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,14,2

8678,2,7, It's simple.,How I Met Your Mother,Lily,13,2
8683,2,7," Okay, I may have exaggerated that last one, but the point is, he was mean. And that's why I took away his ball.",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,112,23
8684,2,7, What does his ball have to do with anything?,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,45,9
8685,2,7," Druthers has to be taught he can't behave like that. When I was teaching kindergarten,whenever a kid was mean, I would take away one of his toys. The kid would be upset at first,but then he'd learn to stop being mean.",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,218,41

8696,2,7, So is being mean.,How I Met Your Mother,Lily,18,4
8697,2,7," Lily, your little system doesn't even make sense. In kindergarten, the kid knew why he was being punished. Druthers just thinks someone stole his ball.",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,152,25
8698,2,7," Well, that's why I left a note.",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,32,7
8699,2,7, A note?,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,8,2

9628,2,10," Clam Bake. Staten Island. Who's in? Okay, I didn't have high hopes for that one. Okay, here's my thing. If gay guys start getting married, then suddenly the whole world's gonna be doing it. That's how it works. They start something, then six months later, everyone follows. Like now everyone gets manicures.",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,308,52

9693,2,10," To show people that we are different from the millions of T-shirt and jeans lemmings out there. The suit shows that we are a force to be reckoned with, a two-person army that plays by its own rules. But you've taken off the uniform, you've crossed enemy lines, and you've abandoned me. Well, I'm not gonna let you do that. It's not too late to back out of this stupid marriage thing! You don't have to do this, bro!",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,416,79

9722,2,11," Kids, as you know, Christmas is a time you spend with your family. So in December of 2006, I had three options. Spend it with my mom and her new boyfriend Clint, spend it with my dad and his new girlfriend micro-brewing, or head down to Staten Island to spend it with my super religious cousin Stacy and her family. So I opted for none of the above and decided to spend Christmas 2006 in Manhattan... celebrating with my other family.",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,435,81

9745,2,11, Why would you call me that?,How I Met Your Mother,Lily,28,6

9892,2,11, I've apologized to Marshall and he's forgiven me and we've moved passed it. Why can't you?,How I Met Your Mother,Lily,91,16
9893,2,11," Because you never apologized to me. Marshall's not the only one you walked out on. You leave for three months, you don't even call. Come on, Lily, we're supposed to be friends!",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,177,32

9917,2,11, I thought you were writing a paper.,How I Met Your Mother,Lily,36,7
9918,2,11," Ah, naw, I blew that off. I'll get an extension. School's not important. What is that pitter patter on the roof? Could it be the sound of an awesome Christmas story about to come down the chimney? Why, yes, it is. 'Twas the day before Christmas...",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,248,46
9920,2,11," It was supposed to arrive, like, five days ago, but then it got lost and rerouted. I checked two other branches, finally they told me it was here.",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,147,28
9922,2,11," What?No, no, no, no,I need that package today.",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,47,8

9940,2,11," Oh, man, I know something you could get her that would blow her mind. Ready? Eight years ago...",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,96,18
9942,2,11," When I was a kid, all I wanted was an Easy Bake Oven. I begged and I begged, but all I got was a stupid Lego set because my feminist mom didn't want me conforming to traditional gender roles.",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,192,39

9962,2,11," That's a great idea, Charity. But, really, I don't know. I mean how do you choose your favorite passage? It's the Bible; there's so many... great ones... That one from Pulp Fiction's pretty cool. Doorbell rings. Ooh, I'll get it. Charity, I'm tapping you in.",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,259,45
9966,2,11," Uh, it's... it's just, um, carolers. Marshall starts singing. Robin and Barney follow.",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,87,13

9987,2,12, What?!,How I Met Your Mother,Robin,7,1

10016,2,12, Of course. Everyone should see the Empire State Building.,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,58,9

10025,2,12," Instead of telling Ted you love him, you said ""falafel""?",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,57,10
10026,2,12, I totally choked.,How I Met Your Mother,Robin,18,3
10027,2,12, I just don't get it. Why can't you tell Ted you love him?,How I Met Your Mother,Lily,58,13

10031,2,12, Don't tell me you're actually buying into Barney's freeway theory.,How I Met Your Mother,Lily,67,10

10034,2,12," Wait a minute, a month ago you told me relationships are like a traveling circus.",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,82,15
10035,2,12," No, this is new. This trumps that. Freeways have exits. So do relationships. The first exit, my personal favorite, is six hours in. You meet, you talk, you have s*x, you exit when she's in the shower.",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,201,37
10036,2,12," So every girl you have s*x with feels the immediate need to shower? Actually, yeah, I get that.",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,96,18
10037,2,12," The next exits are four days, three weeks, seven months--that's when you guys are gonna break up, mark your calendars.",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,119,20
10038,2,12, What?,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,6,1
10039,2,12," Then a year and a half, 18 years, and the last exit-- death. Which, if you've been with the same woman for your entire life, it's like, ""Are we there yet?""",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,156,31
10041,2,12," So I've never been on the freeway this long before. I mean, usually by now I find out the guy has some weird personality thing that makes me want to take the next exit.",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,169,34
10042,2,12," Yeah, been there. I once dated a guy who could only go to the bathroom when classical music was playing. Okay, it was Marshall.",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,128,24
10043,2,12, It's just things are going so well with Ted I just don't want to complicate it.,How I Met Your Mother,Robin,80,16
10044,2,12," Relax, it'll happen when it happens. Which is also the advice I gave Marshall to get him over the classical music thing.",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,121,22
10045,2,12," Oh, here comes Katie.",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,22,4
10046,2,12," Aw, your sister's so cute.",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,27,5

10052,2,12," Oh, good. Good. So, who is this... tongue person?",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,50,9
10055,2,12," Oh, you said that. Great. So how long have you two been...?",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,60,12
10060,2,12, That's cool. This is my friend Lily.,How I Met Your Mother,Robin,37,7
10062,2,12," You say things! Well, come on, let's get you back to my place, we'll get you settled.",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,86,17
10064,2,12," Uh, no, you're not.",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,20,4
10066,2,12, What? Oh. Oh...,How I Met Your Mother,Robin,16,3
10068,2,12, I can't believe my baby sister is planning to lose her virginity to a......douche with a faux hawk. This can't happen. You guys have to help me talk her out of it.,How I Met Your Mother,Robin,164,32
10069,2,12, Speech to talk a girl out of having s*x.,How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,41,9
10070,2,12," Yeah, I don't have any of those.",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,33,7
10071,2,12, Discouraging premarital s*x is against my religion.,How I Met Your Mother,Barney,52,7
10072,2,12, Please? I'm her older sister. I'm supposed to teach her how to make good and responsible decisions.,How I Met Your Mother,Robin,100,17
10073,2,12, It's 2,How I Met Your Mother,Lily,7,2
10074,2,12, That's why I need your help.,How I Met Your Mother,Robin,29,6
10076,2,12," Robin convinced Katie to stay with her that first night. And the next day, I took everybody to the Empire State Building.",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,122,22
10077,2,12, You guys are lucky you came here with an architect. Empire State Building fun,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,78,14
10079,2,12," You know, Katie, I have wanted to come to the Empire State Building for so long, but I waited to come here with someone special.",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,129,25
10081,2,12, Marshall and I have never been to the Empire State Building either. But I'm so glad I waited to do something so important with my fiancee.,How I Met Your Mother,Lily,139,26
10082,2,12," Speaking of waiting, I signed an abstinence pledge in high school. It's totally cool to wait. And stay away from drugs... other than pot.",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,138,24
10084,2,12," Oh, okay, yes, I told them. But only because I think you should hear it from other grownups, too. Everyone thinks you should wait. Right, guys?",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,144,26
10086,2,12, s*x is fun.,How I Met Your Mother,Barney,12,3
10087,2,12, See?,How I Met Your Mother,Robin,5,1

10093,2,12, Even Kyle gets to do that.,How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,27,6
10095,2,12," But Kyle? Why can't you just wait? Because if you wait, you can get a nice guy like Ted.",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,89,19
10097,2,12," You smoke now, too?",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,20,4
10098,2,12," Oh, remember cloves?",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,21,3
10099,2,12, No!,How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,4,1
10100,2,12," No ""Aw, remember cloves?"" This can't happen. She's my baby sister, okay? She should be watching The Little Mermaid and drinking Yoohoo, and not having s*x.",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,156,26
10101,2,12," Come on, you were only 16 when you had s*x. I was 17.",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,54,13

10916,2,15," Oh, hey, just so you know, uh, all marathon runners get to use the subway for free today.",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,90,18
10917,2,15," Wow. You know I really should check out this ""subway."" Heard so much about it. Wow. Look at me. Slumming it. Maybe I'll make a weekend out of it and I'll call my bridge and tunnel girl tonight.",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,194,38
10918,2,15, You're dating a girl from New Jersey?,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,38,7

10946,2,15, No...!,How I Met Your Mother,Barney,7,1
10948,2,15," See? If Barney never tried to run the marathon, you never would have jumped that turnstile, you wouldn't have had that court date today, and we would have made this flight.",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,173,31
10949,2,15, You're right. Everything can be traced back to him. Like that rash we all got at Christmas. I have to see what's going on.,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,123,24

10956,2,15," Well, he never even called you back?",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,37,7

10959,2,15, What was the name of the airline again?,How I Met Your Mother,Robin,40,8
10960,2,15, I think it was something like Flights R' Us.,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,45,9

10965,2,15," If we miss this flight, it's all Barney's fault.",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,49,9
10966,2,15," You know, Barney never would have run the marathon in the first place if Marshall hadn't broken his toe.",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,105,19
10967,2,15," Yeah, so? What, you think this is my fault?",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,44,9
10968,2,15," For Marshall, the initial idea to run the marathon came way back in April.",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,75,14
10971,2,15, My pants are starting to feel a little tight.,How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,46,9
10972,2,15," Oh, that's okay. I love that cute little belly.",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,48,9
10973,2,15, I cannot allow this.,How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,21,4

10977,2,15," ""It is important to load up on carbohydrates two to four hours before a big run. Try a breakfast of a bagel, a banana, oatmeal, strawberries and some orange juice."" Here you go, Marshmallow. Just like the book said.",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,216,39
10978,2,15," Yeah, but from now on, I'm eating all of my breakfast runner-style. Liquids are digested faster. That way, no energy is wasted, and it's all about the run.",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,156,28

10985,2,15," Marshall? Oh, my God!",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,22,4
10987,2,15," So, yes, it was your fault. I mean, if you don't show up at the apartment in the middle of the day, Marshall doesn't break his toe, Barney doesn't run in his place, I don't jump the turnstile and get a court date, and we make our flight in plenty of time!  And I don't fall down and bite my tongue at the airport.",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,314,64
10988,2,15, That really wasn't my fault. I wouldn't have walked in on,How I Met Your Mother,Robin,58,11

11011,2,15, That's kind of annoying.,How I Met Your Mother,Robin,25,4
11012,2,15," Well, I'm sure somebody will be out here to turn it off any minute.  I don't think I can take this. Every time it turns off, I think, oh, maybe it won't turn on again, but then it does. Why does it, Robin? Why does it keep turning on?",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,235,49
11013,2,15," It's gonna be okay, sweetie. Why... Why don't we make a game out of it, okay? Why don't we sing along?",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,103,21

11033,2,15, Robin...,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,9,1
11034,2,15,"  One second, Ted. Um, you know, a lot of people ask me that. The truth is,",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,75,16
11037,2,15," God, it is so nice to meet a fan! And I would be a fan of your work if you could get us two seats on that next flight.",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,119,29

11057,2,15," Yeah, but for what?",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,20,4
11059,2,15," It was me. I started this. If I hadn't picked up that penny, we wouldn't have gone to get hot dogs all the way across town.",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,124,26
11060,2,15," And we wouldn't have seen that wedding dress store, Lily wouldn't have wanted to camp out there, and I wouldn't have needed a nap at your apartment the next day.",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,162,30
11061,2,15," Marshall wouldn't have broken his toe. Barney wouldn't have run the marathon. I wouldn't have jumped that turnstile, gotten arrested, had that court date...",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,157,24
11062,2,15, And we would have made our flight. I don't think we can go back any further than that unless you know who dropped the penny.,How I Met Your Mother,Robin,125,25
11063,2,15," I wish I did. Though that person's already been punished enough, losing a sweet penny like that.",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,97,17

11070,2,15," But that's not what happened. They didn't reschedule. They hired someone else. And as it turned out, three months later, that guy ended up having to relocate to Chicago. Kids, funny thing about destiny, I thought I was destined to get that job. But I was wrong. My destiny was to stay in New York. Because if I hadn't, I never would have met your mother.",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,355,66

11115,2,16," Lily, I love you, but we're too old for this. Asking someone to come see your play is like asking someone for a ride to the airport or to crash on your couch or to help you move. Call a cab, book a room, hire some movers and repeat after me",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,241,51

11418,2,17, And Marshall was a total slob.,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,31,6
11420,2,17," Hey  I'm driving my Fiero back over break. I know we see enough of each other as it is, but if you want a ride, I could use the gas money. You live in Ohio, right? I could swing through and pick you up.",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,203,44

11510,2,17," Okay. Shortly after we met Robin, she and I were jonesing for Thai food from this one place.",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,93,18
11512,2,17, An hour and a half delivery. We can't wait that long.,How I Met Your Mother,Robin,54,11
11513,2,17," I wish we could take the Fiero, but Marshall has this insane no-food rule.",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,75,14
11514,2,17," But Thai food, Lily. Pad Yum Mao. Tom Kai Gah. Thai See Ran.",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,61,13
11515,2,17," Oh! You're just saying random syllables, and it still sounds delicious. Okay. Here's what we'll do.

11518,2,17," Shut up! Now, listen to me. The clock is ticking. Okay, first thing, we scoop up all these little pieces of tofu and cabbage. Next, what we need to take care of are the really messy parts-- the pools that have collected. We got to soak that soup up. Last is the smell. We got to cover up that Tom Kah Gai.

11581,2,17, True story.,How I Met Your Mother,Barney,12,2
11582,2,17, Guys. This Fiero's meant a lot to all of us. Friendships were made. Adventures had. Horrors faced. That's why we have to get rid of it.,How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,136,26

11586,2,17," But that's life. You know? You never end up where you thought you wanted to be. I'm not helping the environment. Ted's not a philosopher. Lily's not not a world-famous artist. Barney's never driven more than ten miles an hour. Robin, I'm sure, has also experience disappointment in her life. Maybe? And my Fiero's not a Fiero that went 200,000 miles. It's okay. You know?

Maybe even the first car our four kids remember.",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,598,110

12646,2,20, Have your pets spayed or neutered.,How I Met Your Mother,Barney,35,6
12647,2,20, Why didn't you tell him?,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,25,5
12648,2,20," Well, it's just... If you lived your whole life thinking one thing, it would be pretty devastating to find out that wasn't true. I just don't think Bob could have handled it.",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,175,32
12649,2,20, Bob. Yeah. Probably a good choice.,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,35,6
12650,2,20," Anyway, on the bright side. Happy wedding again!",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,49,8
12651,2,20, And that's the story of how Uncle Barney gave Lily and Marshall a dune buggy for their wedding.,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,96,18
12653,2,20," Um, I thought since we're going to be apart for two whole weeks, I would sing you your night-night song. Night-night, Lily Night-night, Lily It's time to go to bed, oh, my silly, little Lily Time to rest your little head Sha-la-la-la-la Sha-la-la-la-la Come on, Ted.",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,267,46
12654,2,20," No, it's weird.",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,16,3
12655,2,20, You promised.,How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,14,2
12656,2,21," In May of 2007, Aunt Lily and Uncle Marshall got married at the historic Van Smoot House in upstate New York.",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,110,21
12658,2,21," Wow, it's beautiful, Lily.",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,27,4
12659,2,21, Yeah. It's just how I always pictured it.,How I Met Your Mother,Lily,42,8
12662,2,21," So, we've decided on a small, outdoor wedding, just family and close friends. No more than 25 people in a beautiful garden somewhere, maybe an acoustic guitar playing while we walk down the aisle.",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,197,34
12663,2,21, And maybe you already know someone who went down to the courthouse and registered as an officiant so that he or she-- he-- could perform the ceremony.,How I Met Your Mother,Barney,151,27
12664,2,21, But you hate marriage. Why do you want to perform the ceremony?,How I Met Your Mother,Robin,64,12
12665,2,21," Because it subtly implants in the mind of every woman there that when I ask a question, you say, ""I do."" Yeah.",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,111,22
12666,2,21," The closer you get to the big day, the more concessions you make.",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,66,13
12668,2,21, Great. Now my mom's making me invite the Lessners. This puts our numbers in the triple digits.,How I Met Your Mother,Lily,95,17

12670,2,21," Yeah. This is one of those times, sweetie?",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,43,8
12671,2,21, You know what? That's okay. It'll be a slightly big outdoor wedding.,How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,69,12
12673,2,21," So it's not going to be an outdoor wedding anymore. Marshall's dad is convinced if we have an outdoor wedding in New York, he's going to get mugged, so it's going to be inside now. It'll be great. We're still going to have our acoustic guitar player.",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,251,47
12675,2,21," So now, instead of an acoustic guitar, we're having a harp player. Yeah. My dad owes a guy, and... that guy's daughter plays the harp.",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,135,25
12676,2,21," Is she hot? I'd love to be able to cross ""harp player"" off my list.",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,68,15
12677,2,21, How long is this list?,How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,23,5
12678,2,21," Dude, I'm not gonna count how many pages the list is. I'm not crass.",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,69,14

12680,2,21, Sweet! I can cross off two things.,How I Met Your Mother,Barney,35,7
12682,2,21, And the day arrives for Lily and Marshall's very big indoor wedding... with a harp.,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,84,15
12685,2,21, Wow. Andrea. You really are pregnant.,How I Met Your Mother,Lily,38,6
12687,2,21, How do you play the harp with your belly so...?,How I Met Your Mother,Robin,48,10
12689,2,21, You only play half the harp?,How I Met Your Mother,Robin,29,6
12691,2,21," Oh, no. Uh, okay. Lily, I will take care of this. Um, I'll just pluck the other half. Is it hard to learn?",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,107,23
12693,2,21," Yeah, but I'm a fast learner. You ever hear of ""Guitar Hero""? Learned that in a day. Is there a ""Harp Hero""?",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,109,22
12694,2,21," Robin, it's fine. So, so, when are you due?",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,44,9
12696,2,21," Wow, that's soon.",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,18,3
12699,2,21," Holy crap, we have to fire her. She's gonna drop a shorty in the middle of your ceremony.",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,90,18
12700,2,21," Robin, I'm not going to freak myself out. I hate those women who say, ""Oh, my wedding has to be perfect."" Things go wrong. Sometimes the deejay screws up your playlist. Sometimes you slip on placenta during the recessional.",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,224,39
12702,2,21, Can I grab a scotch and soda real quick?,How I Met Your Mother,Barney,41,9
12704,2,21," Wow. You just cost yourself a big tip, buddy.",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,46,9
12706,2,21," You allowed to accept criticism? You, sir, are an ass... buddy.",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,64,11
12708,2,21," Hey, you want to know what line doesn't work on a harp player? ""Hey, baby, want to pluck?""",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,91,18
12709,2,21, Really? That didn't work.,How I Met Your Mother,Robin,26,4
12710,2,21, Not even a little. Hey! Who's Bill?,How I Met Your Mother,Barney,36,7
12711,2,21, Bill?,How I Met Your Mother,Lily,6,1
12712,2,21, Yeah. This guy came up to me at the bar.,How I Met Your Mother,Barney,41,10
12715,2,21, Uh... Don't think they do that anymore.,How I Met Your Mother,Barney,40,7
12718,2,21," Oh, no. Did he look like a guy who tried to be an umpire but failed?",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,69,16
12719,2,21, He kind of did.,How I Met Your Mother,Barney,16,4
12720,2,21, That's Scooter.,How I Met Your Mother,Lily,16,2
12721,2,21," Your high school boyfriend, Scooter?",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,37,5
12722,2,21, His real name is Bill. My mom must have invited him.,How I Met Your Mother,Lily,53,11
12723,2,21, Why? Why would she do that?,How I Met Your Mother,Robin,28,6
12724,2,21," Our families are really close. But my ex-boyfriend? Come on, Mom. I didn't invite that professional squash player Dad busted you with. Oh, I need a glass of wine.",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,163,29
12725,2,21, I'll get it.,How I Met Your Mother,Barney,13,3
12726,2,21," Oh, thanks. Hey, how's Marshall doing?",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,39,6
12727,2,21, He's great. He's about to get his hair cut.,How I Met Your Mother,Barney,44,9
12728,2,21, Oh. I'm worried my cousin's going to cut it too short.,How I Met Your Mother,Lily,55,11
12729,2,21," Me, too. I was up all night.",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,29,7
12732,2,21," Hey, Bill.",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,11,2

12744,2,21," White. And, uh... she'd also like a scotch and soda.",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,53,10
12746,2,21, She'd also like a bowl of smoked almonds.,How I Met Your Mother,Barney,42,8
12748,2,21," Well, it's only the biggest day of her life, so...The barman leaves... Let the games begin.",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,92,16
12750,2,21, Here. Can't stay. Got to try something.,How I Met Your Mother,Barney,40,7
12752,2,21, That is a good song.,How I Met Your Mother,Robin,21,5
12756,2,21, That's Scooter.,How I Met Your Mother,Robin,16,2

12771,2,21," No, but it worked, didn't it?",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,30,6
12773,2,21," There's a photographer? Oh, my God. Okay, I just have to call...",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,65,12
12774,2,21," Robin, stop. Stop. It's okay. I am not gonna let anything get to me today.",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,75,15

12780,2,21, I'm fine.,How I Met Your Mother,Lily,10,2
12783,2,21, Totally cool.,How I Met Your Mother,Lily,14,2

12786,2,21, Are you sure?,How I Met Your Mother,Robin,14,3
12787,2,21," I'm marrying Marshall today. So it doesn't even matter that I'm gonna walk down the aisle without a veil in a room that has no flowers to the music of half a harp played by a woman who's crowning, as my high school boyfriend reads Guns N' Roses lyrics. But that's okay, because there's no photographer there to take any pictures of it anyway.",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,343,64
12788,2,21," Lily, are you okay?",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,20,4
12789,2,21, What do you think?! Of course I'm not okay! Everything that could possibly go wrong at my wedding has! It's ruined!,How I Met Your Mother,Lily,116,21
12790,2,21," What happened to ""I don't want a perfect wedding""?",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,51,9

12801,2,21, The good Backstreet Boys?,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,26,4
12802,2,21, Guys! Guys! What am I gonna do?!,How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,33,7
12803,2,21, What-what the hell happened to you?,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,36,6
12804,2,21," Lily's cousin is in beauty school, and Lily didn't want her to do her hair, so she said she could do mine.",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,107,22
12806,2,21," So, um, just not-not too short, okay?",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,38,7
12808,2,21," Oh, okay, yeah, that's great. 'Cause, um, when it gets too short, it starts to look weird. And I don't want to look weird when I'm up there, you know.",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,151,30
12810,2,21," I don't think I need advice on how to be cool, but yeah, great, lay that on me.",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,80,18

12814,2,21, What? What can you do?,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,23,5
12815,2,21, I have a superpower.,How I Met Your Mother,Barney,21,4
12816,2,21, Lily is gonna kill me! Look at me! She's not gonna want to marry me like this.,How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,79,17
12817,2,21, That's crazy. Of course she will.,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,34,6
12818,2,21, Would you marry me?,How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,20,4
12819,2,21, No. But not because of the hair. It's because I have a rule,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,60,13
12820,2,21," Oh, great. So now you're saying Lily and I shouldn't even get married?",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,71,13
12823,2,21," Could I have everyone's attention, please? It's for the bride. One, the bride would... like all of this tension out of my shoulders. And she would like, let's say, you in the inappropriatel short dress to rub them. Two... What was two?",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,236,42
12825,2,21," Okay, we have a bit of a situation. Let's not panic. Let's just find a solution.",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,81,16
12827,2,21," Yeah, yeah, but it's good. I ought to shave it all off. What a great solution. Just be bald 'cause it's cool, right? Bruce Willis, Michael Jordan, Britney Spears... Oh, God, what did I do?! How could you let me shave my head?!",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,227,43
12828,2,21, What?!,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,7,1
12829,2,21, You're the worst best man ever! I hate you! I'm not going out there! I'm leaving and I'm never coming back.I'm gonna go find that money under the rock by the tree and go live with the guys on the beach in Zihautanejo.,How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,218,43
12830,2,21," Dude, those guys are criminals.",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,32,5
12831,2,21," Only Red Andy was falsely accused. Ted, you're my best man! You got to do something!",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,85,16
12832,2,21," Okay, all right, come here. Just breathe, breathe, all right? Don't worry. Don't worry. I'll just... I'll take these.",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,118,19
12833,2,21, No!,How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,4,1
12835,2,21," Uh, hi. Uncle Ben, right?",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,26,5
12837,2,21," Yes, we're, we're having a little bit of a problem back there. Um, and I was wondering if you could help us out.",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,113,23
12839,2,21, Marshall accidentally shaved part of his head.,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,47,7
12841,2,21," Yeah. Yeah, so here's what I was thinking. What if I found something to cover up the bald area?",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,96,19
12843,2,21," Maybe a wig of some sort or a, um... toupee. Something that matches",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,68,13
12846,2,21, That is true. That is true. We just need to find someone who wears a toupee that is the same color as Marshall's and your hair.,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,128,26
12848,2,21, Really? You can't think of any place in the general area where there might be a toupee of the kind I'm describing to you?,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,122,24
12850,2,21, Let me come at this from a different angle. I got $50 in my pocket which is probably a lot more... Barney comes and takes the toupee.,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,134,27
12851,2,21, The bride needs this.,How I Met Your Mother,Barney,22,4
12853,2,21," Actually, I think it kinda works.",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,34,6
12854,2,21, It totally does.,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,17,3

12857,2,21," Okay, problem solved. Crisis averted. Let's get me married. It looks terrible, doesn't it?",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,91,14
12858,2,21," It kinda looks like fur, which gives you the appearance of a cleaned-up Bigfoot.",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,81,14
12859,2,21," Oh, you know...",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,16,3
12860,2,21, In a bad way.,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,14,4
12862,2,21, What happened to your shirt?,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,29,5
12864,2,21, You gonna put another shirt on?,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,32,6
12866,2,21, What? What? Scooter's here? That guy's at my wedding?,How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,54,9
12868,2,21," Okay, you know what? I need some air. I think we should go for a walk, okay?",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,77,17
12870,2,21, It would cover up the problem. It's festive and it celebrates the heritage of this great nation.,How I Met Your Mother,Barney,97,17
12871,2,21," Okay, unless you actually have one in your car, stop suggesting authentic Native American headdress.",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,101,15
12872,2,21," Oh, no.",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,8,2
12873,2,21," Oh, my God! Marshall...",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,24,4
12874,2,21," Lily, you're not supposed to see me.",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,37,7
12875,2,21," Holy crap, I don't think anyone's supposed to see you.",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,55,10
12876,2,21, What happened? Did Amy do this to you?,How I Met Your Mother,Lily,39,8
12877,2,21," Just the frosted tips. I did the rest. I'm sorry, baby. I've ruined the whole wedding, haven't I?",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,98,18
12878,2,21," Oh, no, you didn't ruin the wedding, sweetie. It was already ruined. There's no flowers, no photographer. Oh, and Scooter's here, by the way.",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,142,24
12879,2,21," Yeah, I know. I heard.",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,23,5
12880,2,21," My veil got thrashed, the harp player is in labor, and I'm not wearing my wedding underwear.",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,93,17
12881,2,21," What? No ""Property of Marshall"" across the back? How are people going to know whose butt that is?",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,98,18
12882,2,21," What happened? Remember the wedding we wanted, the intimate outdoor ceremony?",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,78,11
12883,2,21, I wish we could have that wedding.,How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,35,7
12884,2,21, So do it.,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,10,3
12885,2,21, What?,How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,6,1
12886,2,21," Get married now. Right here. Look, it's outside like you always wanted. Intimate, close friends. There's no guitar, but it's pretty close. Barney can officiate.",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,161,25
12887,2,21," Yes. Yes, I can. Uh, excuse me, guys. You all dropped something",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,64,12
12888,2,21," Could we even do that? I mean, what about all those people in there?",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,69,14
12889,2,21," Do that one, too. And then when everything goes wrong, you won't care because you already had the real wedding out here.",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,121,22
12890,2,21," What do you think, baby?",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,25,5
12891,2,21, I love it.,How I Met Your Mother,Lily,11,3
12892,2,21," Me, too. Let's do it. Let's get married before we get married.",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,63,12
12893,2,21," Great. Wait, hold on. Excuse me, sir. Could we borrow your hat?",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,64,12
12895,2,21, Thank you.,How I Met Your Mother,Lily,11,2
12897,2,21, Hat. We thought of authentic Native American headdress before we thought of hat.,How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,81,13
12898,2,21," Thank you all for coming. For those of you who don't know me... I'm not the biggest believer in marriage. But... you two are so great together, you know? It's like you were, uh, made for each other.",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,199,38
12899,2,21, He's gonna cry.,How I Met Your Mother,Robin,16,3
12900,2,21," No, I'm not. I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not. Lily and Marshall... when everyone sees you, they... see true love. It's the best love... Can we just, um, move on to the rings or something?",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,200,39
12901,2,21," Oh, no. I don't have my vows.",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,30,7
12902,2,21, I don't have mine either.,How I Met Your Mother,Lily,26,5
12903,2,21, You don't need your vows. Just say why you love each other.,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,60,12
12904,2,21," Okay, I'll go first. Lily, there are a million reasons why I love you. You make me laugh and you take care of me when I'm sick.

13057,2,22," Because even though you don't want to get married, I'd like to think the fact that we've been together for a year, and that we love each other might get me a gentler reaction than, ""No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

13112,2,22, Okay. Let's do it-- let's move to Argentina.,How I Met Your Mother,Robin,45,8
13114,2,22," No es posible! Nobody moves to Argentina.

13125,2,22, You know what I mean.,How I Met Your Mother,Robin,22,5
13126,2,22," No, I don't. Okay, say we had kids. They wouldn't have to grow up in some suburb somewhere. They would grow up on the road having adventures with us. Think of all the Hard Rock Cafe T-shirts they could collect.",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,211,40

13142,2,22," Say the story's not over! Oh, God, this is the 12th most worried I've ever been that someone's pregnant.",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,105,19

17890,3,15," Yeah, sorry.",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,13,2
17894,3,15," So that brings us to today. A little background. So I'm working on this report called ""Using 23-b-3 spurious class action precedent to contest a class certification order based on a lack of commonality, numerosity...""",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,218,35
17895,3,15," Dude, you lost us. Can't you just call it something cool like ""the ninja report""?",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,82,15

17913,3,15," Barney, I have never been screamed at like that in my life.",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,60,12
17914,3,15," Come on, when's the last time you got screamed at at work?",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,59,12
17915,3,15," I got screamed at three times today. Once in Korean. This is corporate America, Marshall. Screaming is a motivational tool, like christmas bonuses or sexual harassment. It's just good business.",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,194,30
17916,3,15," Oh, baby, it's just not fair. You've been working so hard. Late nights, weekends. I never see you. We've barely made love in weeks. It's bad, guys, mama needs her sugar.",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,170,31
17917,3,15," Look, Marshall, he screamed at you, you took it. He probably respects you more for it.",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,87,16
17918,3,15," Yeah, about that... So Arthur's busy giving me the full screaming treatment... Face turning red, vein in his forehead about to burst, spittle flying like shrapnel. Everyone you work with walking by your office, peering in. And suddenly, I just felt all of it.",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,260,44
17919,3,15, All of what?,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,13,3
17920,3,15," All of it. The fact that I became a lawyer to save the environment, and now I'm working for the bad guys instead. The fact that I am stuck in this job because of a mortgage I can barely afford on an apartment that is crooked. The fact that I am a grown man, and nobody, not even Artillery Arthur, has the right to talk to me like that!",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,336,69

17942,3,15, So we good?,How I Met Your Mother,Robin,12,3
17944,3,15, Then why are you still in my office?,How I Met Your Mother,Robin,37,8
17946,3,15," Okay, gun violence might be the answer to everything up in Canada, Robin, but here in America, we solve our problems with words. Marshall, you go in and you dazzle this guy with a big eloquent speech defending human dignity. Like abraham Lincoln.",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,247,43
17947,3,15," Yeah, because it's so easy just to bust out a big, eloquent speech off the top of your head.",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,93,19

17950,3,15, Arthur?,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,8,1

17960,3,15," Yeah, but how good would it feel to walk in there tomorrow, tell him off and then quit?",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,88,18
17961,3,15," It's great to fantasize about, but nobody ever actually does it.",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,65,11
17962,3,15," Gary blauman did it. Guy I used to work with, the guy's a legend now. We were at the morning meeting and old Blauman was getting reamed out but good.",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,150,30

17971,3,15," Oh, my God.",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,12,3
17972,3,15, He peed on the conference table?,How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,33,6
17978,3,15," Eventually, he just gave up and left. And then his cousin's website tanked. And then he became a janitor at an old folks' home and moved into a one-room apartment above a bowling alley.",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,186,34
17979,3,15, That's it? that's the end of the story?,How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,40,8

17981,3,15," How does that help me? How does any of this help me? Can somebody, for god's sakes, please give me one piece of useful advice?",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,127,25
17982,3,15," Lily, control your woman. The lesson of Blauman is that when your boss screams at you, you never scream back. That's why there's a little thing in corporate America I like to call the chain of screaming.",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,204,37
17983,3,15, Chain of screaming?,How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,20,3
17984,3,15," Yes. The chain of screaming starts at the top. Arthur's boss's boss screams at Arthur's boss. Arthur's boss screams at Arthur. Arthur screams at you. You go home and scream at Lily. Lily screams at one of the kids in her kindergarten class. Then that kid screams at her dad, Arthur's boss's boss. And the whole thing starts all over again, Thus completing the circle of screaming.",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,381,67
17985,3,15, I thought it was a chain of screaming.,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,39,8

17987,3,15, I don't scream at Lily.,How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,24,5
17988,3,15," And I don't scream at my kids, none of whom have parents who work at marshall's firm.",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,86,17
17989,3,15, So it's not a circle.,How I Met Your Mother,Robin,22,5
17990,3,15," Fine! You want it to be a chain of screaming, it's a chain of screaming. I came up with the circle idea halfway through, 'cause I thought it was a more elegant metaphor, but fine, ruin it! You guys always undermine me when I'm trying to make a point, and I'm sick of it! God, I'm surrounded by idiots! Idiots! See, doesn't everyone feel better now?",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,349,66
17991,3,15," Lily, I need your take on this. What... what should I do?",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,58,12

19821,4,1," Yeah, I'm nervous for the other team 'cause when I step up to that plate... I am not a New York Yankee. Any other night, I would probably try to convince you that I am, but I'm not.

19832,4,1," Oh, I'm not confused. You know who is confused? Bimbos. They're easily confused. It's one of the thousand little things I love about them. I love their vacant, trusting stares, their sluggish, unencumbered minds, their unresolved daddy issues. I love them and they love me. Bimbos have always been there for me, through thick and thin. Mostly thin. B- man don't do thick crust. What up?",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,387,66

33211,6,3," Yeah, I know. You turned it down. We hired someone else.",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,57,11
33213,6,3," Can you believe it? He's resorting to the oldest move in the book. The classic, ""pretend to take the offer off the table so I'll want it more."" It's so obvious, right? As if that's going to make me be like, ""Oh, God, I never should have said no.""",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,247,49
33214,6,3," It's not a move, dude. I executed the paperwork for the new architect this morning. Barney wasn't lying.",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,105,18
33215,6,3," Oh, God, I never should have said no! Come on, GNB didn't really hire a new architect. This is just one of Barney's moves.",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,123,24
33216,6,3," It's not a move, dude. The senior partners were getting impatient. I thought you didn't even want the job.",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,107,19

33220,6,3," What? Ted, it's too late.",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,26,5
33221,6,3, I'll design it for half of what you're paying the other architect. And you know I will do stuff they would never do. Lobby stuff.,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,130,25
33222,6,3," Wow, half? Ted, on behalf of Goliath National Bank...",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,54,9

33236,6,3," Come on, Ted! This is your dream.",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,34,7
33237,6,3," No, it's not. Not anymore. And you know what? Letting go of that dream was the best decision I ever made. You guys actually think I have some lingering itch to be an architect? Work 20 hours a day and weekends? To get ulcers and pull my hair out and worry and doubt myself and then at the end of it all, have the rug pulled out from under me? I love being a professor, okay? All that stupid crap they tell you about how fulfilling teaching is? It's all true. I'm happy, and I'm not letting go of that. My answer's no.",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,518,103

33244,6,3, Fine. I called Don again.,How I Met Your Mother,Robin,26,5
33246,6,3," Hey, Don! It's Robin again. Look, I am sorry for all the calls. It's just, I saw you on the news, and it made me a little crazy for a minute. I guess I wasn't as over our breakup as I thought. But I want to say, from the bottom of my heart, I am going to kill you. No... No, I'm not. I am happy for you. And that Asian slut on your Facebook page. She's dead, too.",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,364,79

33251,6,3," I am never going to have closure. Okay? Closure doesn't exist. Okay, one day, Don and I are moving in together, and the next thing I know, he's on a plane to Chicago. It just... ended. And no matter how much I try to forget that it happened, it will have never not happened. Don and I will always be a loose end. We'll always be...",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,332,66
33253,6,3," Unfinished. Gaudi, to his credit, never gave up on his dream, but that's not usually how it goes. I mean, usually, it isn't a speeding bus that keeps the brown, pointy, weird church from getting built. Most of the time, it's just too difficult or too expensive, or too scary. It's only once you've stopped that you realize how hard it is to start again. So you force yourself not to want it. But it's always there. And until you finish it, it will always be...",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,461,86

33258,6,3, Not so fast. I'm not that easy.,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,32,7
33264,6,3, Who is this?,How I Met Your Mother,Robin,13,3

33277,6,4," Puffy cheeks, smudged mascara, slightly red nose... That girl was just crying. She's so sad and defenseless. Anyone have a condom?",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,131,21
33279,6,4, That's it! You know what? Five-minute time-out! Corner booth! Now.,How I Met Your Mother,Lily,67,10

You see, every woman, no matter how initially repugnant, has a mermaid clock... the time it takes for you to realize you want to bone her. Sure, today you see Iris as a manatee.

37626,6,20,"The point is, you can't trust graduation goggles. They're just as misleading as beer goggles, bridesmaid goggles, and that's-just-a-bulky, outdated-cell-phone in-his-front-pocket goggles. That one was a bummer.",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,210,27
37627,6,20," You're right. Tomorrow, I'm quitting GNB.",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,42,6
37628,6,20," No! You can't quit tomorrow! The lady with the big nipples is coming back to give another sexual harassment seminar, and I bribed one of the maintenance guys to keep the room at a brisk 55 degrees!",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,198,37

37646,6,20," Oh, good for you, sweetie.",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,27,5
37647,6,20," Yeah. It's a little less money than I was expecting. I mean, compared to what I was making at GNB, it's nothing. Actually compared to anything, it's nothing. It's nothing. The paid position just got filled, so all I can do is-is volunteer right now. You're cool with that, right?",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,280,50
37648,6,20," Baby, if this is what you need to do, we'll figure it out. How's Barney handling you leaving?",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,94,18

37662,6,20, Why don't you admit that your girlfriend challenging your every move is getting you a little murder-suicidey?,How I Met Your Mother,Lily,110,17
37663,6,20, Why don't you admit that Marshall quitting his job and taking an unpaid internship is killing you?,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,99,17
37664,6,20, It's not.,How I Met Your Mother,Lily,10,2
37665,6,20," Lily, the downside to having giant, Japanese anime eyes is that they're easy to read. And yours are screaming, ""What about my trip to Spain, deadbeat?""",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,152,26
37666,6,20," Okay, Ted, the downside to having a woman's mouth is, your feminine pout gives away your true feelings. And yours is saying, ""Oh, Zoey, why can't I be on top just this once?""",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,175,33

37684,6,20, That's how I'm gonna use mine.,How I Met Your Mother,Barney,31,6
37685,6,20, Why in the world do you care so much whether Marshall works at GNB?,How I Met Your Mother,Robin,68,14

37693,6,20," Okay, look, Ted, I need a favor. Would you mind driving out to Kennedy with me to pick up this famous ecologist for Marshall's fund-raiser? Apparently, he only speaks Spanish. And you speak Spanish, right?  Perfect. Let's go.",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,226,38
37696,6,20," Hey, Marshall, it's me. Listen, I know I've been kind of a jerk about your leaving GNB. I just wanted to call and say I'm sorry. No apologies necessary. We're good. Good.

37721,6,20," Yeah, I-I know.",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,16,3
37722,6,20, Then why did you ask me to come?,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,33,8
37723,6,20," So you can drive him to the fund-raiser. Supporting Marshall this much is driving me crazy. I'm going to Spain-- my flight leaves in 45 minutes. Adios, muchacho.",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,162,28
37724,6,20," W-Wait, what do you mean you're going to Spain?",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,48,9

37729,6,20, Marshall's been asking a lot lately.,How I Met Your Mother,Lily,37,6
37730,6,20, But the thing to do is-is tell him you've had enough.,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,54,11
37731,6,20," I've never been good at that. And now, ever since his dad died, I-I feel like it's my job to just be fine with everything. But I'm not. I'm not fine that he volunteers our apartment for a giant fund-raiser and that he's not thinking about how we're gonna pay any of our bills and that, apparently, we've given up on trying to have kids.",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,337,65

37738,6,20," I don't want to talk about it, okay?",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,37,8
37739,6,20, Why not?,How I Met Your Mother,Robin,9,2
37740,6,20, Because I don't. And why am I explaining this to you? You're the most secretive person I know. You never tell anybody anything.,How I Met Your Mother,Barney,128,23
37741,6,20," I've never... told anyone this before. Um... I was 16. I was awakened around midnight by the sound of my father arguing with his business partner, Andy Grenier. As things grew heated... I watched my father's hand slowly coil around the heavy antique clock on his desk. The sun was just starting to rise over the bramble orchard as we packed the fresh earth down with the flats of our shovels. My dad and I got our stories straight. We walked back to the house in silence and... haven't talked about it since. But sometimes... on a still night... you can still hear that clock, ticking... ticking... ",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,600,107
37742,6,20, That's... the most harrowing story I've ever heard. Is it true?,How I Met Your Mother,Barney,64,11
37743,6,20," No. But it did get you to drink three scotches, which is why you're ready to spill your guts.",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,94,19
37744,6,20, Fine! The reason I'm upset about Marshall leaving GNB is... is...the meatball sub.,How I Met Your Mother,Barney,83,13
37745,6,20, Huh?,How I Met Your Mother,Robin,5,1
37746,6,20, It all started months ago in the GNB commissary. It was Meatball Sub Day.,How I Met Your Mother,Barney,74,14

37749,6,20," Hey, buddy, I think you got a tiny little bit of marinara sauce on your tie there.",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,83,17
37751,6,20," I plotted my revenge for weeks. But nothing seemed right. Then it hit me. The answer was so elegant and simple-- an exploding meatball sub. For months, I experimented. More... marinara sauce. Finally, the sub was perfected. The plan was in place. The snare was baited. And then...",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,281,48
37753,6,20,"...he quit, Robin, he quit! It's Meatball Sub Day today, which is why I wanted Marshall to come over and have lunch. But no. All that work wasted.  You want to make God laugh, tell him your plans, right?",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,203,39
37754,6,20, What is wrong with you?,How I Met Your Mother,Robin,24,5
37756,6,20," Hey, Professor Rodriguez, thank you so much for coming.",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,56,9
37758,6,20," Right over there. Enjoy. Hey. Hey, thanks for picking him up.",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,62,11

37763,6,20," Marshall, hey. Sorry, I, uh, I had to park and-and grab some ice. Sorry.",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,73,14
37764,6,20," Oh, thanks, babe. You would not believe how much this one has done to help throw this party, Ted. I don't know how she does it. Can't be easy, huh, Lil?",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,153,31
37765,6,20," Yeah. Listen, Marshall, I-I need to talk to you about something.",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,65,11
37766,6,20," No, you know what? Me, too. Um... I want to thank you for being so supportive of me in all this. I've been at the NRDC for less than a week, and I've already done more to be proud of than in two years at GNB. I can't believe how good it feels. But now, it's time for me to find a way to help the Earth and get paid for it, because I can't put that burden entirely on you. So, starting tomorrow, I'll look for something with a paycheck. What do you think?",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,455,95
37767,6,20," Baby, you have my full support.",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,32,6

37785,6,20, I don't have much time!,How I Met Your Mother,Barney,24,5
37786,6,20," Okay, yes, yes, of course. Of course. Does this have some sort of special meaning?",How I Met Your Mother,Marshall,83,15
37789,6,20," Uh, Barney, you got a little marinara on your pajamas.",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,55,10
37793,6,21," What? That's... What is that word you taught me? ""Bull"" something?",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,67,11

37821,6,21," I have to face an ugly truth. Jerry Whittaker, my own father, is anti-awesome-etic. I know Crazy Jerry's still in there somewhere, but he's trapped under 20 years of lawnmower parties and carpool barbecues.",How I Met Your Mother,Barney,207,34
37822,6,21," Wow, you know nothing about the suburbs.",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,41,7
37823,6,21,"Well, this Saturday night, I am bustin' him out. I'm gonna make Jerry realize he was wrong about giving up his old life by showing him the awesomest night of all time.

37827,6,21, That's why you brought these guys.,How I Met Your Mother,Lily,35,6
37828,6,21,No. That's why I brought these guys.  I've made some minor improvements to your identities. Uh. Mm! You'll find them on these cards.,How I Met Your Mother,Barney,132,23

37836,6,21," Well. Well, this could actually be fun. In fact, I believe it was Oscar Wilde who said, ""Man is least himself when he talks...""",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,128,24

But the key to Angry Birds is to always try to see every possible outcome. And to... hit some pigs with rocks or something. I don't know; I don't play. I can't get it to download. The point is, this thing with you and Zoey? I can see it going three possible ways. There's the first scenario.",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,473,92

38482,6,23, Yes,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,4,1
38483,6,23," And you're happy for, like, a second, until you realize the building you helped save has just become a monument to everything this woman made you give up, and you resent her for it, so much so, in fact, that you dump her.",How I Met Your Mother,Robin,222,43
38484,6,23, We're done here.,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,17,3

38489,6,23, The chairman asks you...,How I Met Your Mother,Robin,25,4
38491,6,23, But before you can answer...You're hit in the neck with a blow dart fired by the ninja Zoey's ex-husband hired to assassinate you.,How I Met Your Mother,Robin,131,23
38493,6,23, That one's less likely. What I'm saying... what I hate saying... is this. You and Zoey are gonna break up. But you can still save your career and Barney's.,How I Met Your Mother,Robin,156,29
38494,6,23," Okay, first of all, no ninja's getting a jump on me. I have the reflexes of a jungle... ",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,89,18
38495,6,23, Tree?,How I Met Your Mother,Lily,6,1
38496,6,23," Second of all, I don't care that the odds are stacked against us. I'd rather try to make this work with Zoey than spend the rest of my life alone playing Angry Birds, which, by the way, I've shown you how to download, like, 20 times.",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,234,46
38497,6,23," I've got to say, I'm with Ted on this.",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,39,9
38498,6,23, Thank you.,How I Met Your Mother,Ted,11,2
38499,6,23," I mean, yes, this is a huge, divisive issue for them. Which means no matter what happens, there's gonna be a lot of resentment. Probably lasting for years... infecting every single moment of the rest of their relationship. So, in conclusion, I'm with Robin on this.",How I Met Your Mother,Lily,266,46
38500,6,23, Thank you.,How I Met Your Mother,Robin,11,2
38505,6,23," Barney, what are you doing?",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,28,5

38514,6,23," Okay, yes, it's-it's a terrible building, but... does that mean we have to knock it down? I mean, it's not bothering anyone. Just anyone who lives in it... Or looks at it... Or smells it.",How I Met Your Mother,Ted,188,35
