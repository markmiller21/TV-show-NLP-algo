333,Ted,1,"  Thanks.  You know what? . I'm done being single. I'm not good at it. Look, obviously you can't tell a woman you just met you love her. But... it sucks that you can't. I'll tell you something though, if a woman-not you... just some hypothetical woman-were to bare with me through all this. I think I'd make a damn good husband. Because that's the stuff I'd be good at. Stuff like making her laugh and being a good father... and walking her five hypothetical dogs. Being a good kisser.",1,How I Met Your Mother,485,89

2418,Ted,8," Yeah. I mean, you basically live here anyway. It's not like it'll change anything.",1,How I Met Your Mother,83,14
2421,Barney,8," No, it's like it'll change everything. Oh, Ted, you are so screwed.",1,How I Met Your Mother,68,12
2422,Ted,8, What? What are you talking about?,1,How I Met Your Mother,34,6
2423,Robin,8, And why is that girl checking you out?,1,How I Met Your Mother,39,8

2426,Ted,8," Yeah, so?",1,How I Met Your Mother,10,2
2427,Barney,8," So, you're not still gonna be his roommate when he gets married, are you? Someone's going to move out. So who's it gonna be?",1,How I Met Your Mother,125,24
2428,Robin,8," Come on, Barney, I'm sure they've talked about who gets the apartment. You talked about who gets the apartment, right?",1,How I Met Your Mother,119,20
2429,Ted,8," Yeah, we've talked about it.",1,How I Met Your Mother,29,5
2431,Marshall,8," So, when Lily and I get married, who's gonna get the apartment?",1,How I Met Your Mother,64,12
2432,Ted,8," Oh, that's a tough one. You know who I think could handle a problem like that?",1,How I Met Your Mother,79,16

2435,Marshall,8, Totally. Let's let those guys handle it.,1,How I Met Your Mother,41,7
2437,Ted,8, Dammit Past Ted,1,How I Met Your Mother,16,3
2438,Barney,8," You blew it, dude. Now that Lily's there, it's a whole new dynamic. They're edging you out.",1,How I Met Your Mother,92,17
2439,Ted,8, That's crazy. They're not edging me out. Marshall's my best friend.,1,How I Met Your Mother,68,11
2441,Ted,8, One of my best friends. He wouldn't do that to me.,1,How I Met Your Mother,51,11
2442,Barney,8," Just keep your eyes open. That's all I'm saying, Ted. Little things are gonna be changing around that apartment.",1,How I Met Your Mother,113,19
2443,Robin,8," Come on, Barney, you're just being paranoid. OK, seriously, what is this girl's deal?",1,How I Met Your Mother,86,14
2445,Barney,8, Sort of on a date with her.,1,How I Met Your Mother,28,7
2446,Ted,8, What?,1,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
2447,Barney,8," I found her online. I'm tired of the whole bar scene, the one-night hookups. I'm looking for a soul-mate, someone who I can love and cuddle, or so it says in my profile.  But this girl, she wants the same stuff and it's bumming me out. All right, Ted, call me from the hospital.",1,How I Met Your Mother,279,54
2448,Ted,8, All right.,1,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
2449,Robin,8, You're going to the hospital?,1,How I Met Your Mother,30,5
2450,Ted,8," No, see, he's gonna go back over there and I'm gonna call him and he's gonna pretend that it's an emergency call from a family member at the hospital.",1,How I Met Your Mother,151,29
2451,Robin,8," Oh, Lord, fake emergency? That is lamest, most pathetic cop-out in the book. I expect more from you, Barney.",1,How I Met Your Mother,109,19
2452,Barney,8," Well, stay tuned, I'm working on some stuff. But in the meantime, wish me luck.",1,How I Met Your Mother,80,15
2454,Robin,8," So, are you gonna talk to Marshall?",1,How I Met Your Mother,36,7
2455,Ted,8," He's gonna want the apartment. I'm gonna want the apartment. It's gonna lead to an argument, so no.",1,How I Met Your Mother,100,18
2456,Robin,8," Hm, that's real healthy. So, when a serious issue comes up, your response is just to avoid it.",1,How I Met Your Mother,95,18
2457,Ted,8, I should really make this call.,1,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
2459,Robin,8," Ooh, can I do it?",1,How I Met Your Mother,18,5
2462,Barney,8, Hello? Robin,1,How I Met Your Mother,13,2
2463,Barney,8," Hello, Aunt Kathy, what's up?",1,How I Met Your Mother,30,5
2464,Robin,8," Oh, nothing. Just sitting here, thinking about you, hot stuff.",1,How I Met Your Mother,63,10
2465,Barney,8," An accident? Well, is Uncle Rudy gonna be OK? Robin",1,How I Met Your Mother,52,10
2466,Barney,8, Oh God! Why did he think he could build his own helicopter?,1,How I Met Your Mother,60,12
2467,Robin,8," Come on, daddy, break me off a piece of that white chocolate.",1,How I Met Your Mother,62,12
2468,Barney,8," Well, if he needs a transplant, he can have mine. I'll be right there.",1,How I Met Your Mother,71,14
2470,Barney,8, See you guys later.,1,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
2474,Ted,8," Ah, this'll be nice, the three of us living together. I think it's a good setup.",1,How I Met Your Mother,81,16
2476,Ted,8," Man, this coffee's great. It's really great. Too great.",1,How I Met Your Mother,56,9
2478,Ted,8, What happened to Shocky?,1,How I Met Your Mother,25,4

2482,Ted,8," Yeah, definitely. I mean, so does Shocky.",1,How I Met Your Mother,42,7
2483,Marshall,8, Really? I always thought Shocky's coffee tasted kinda rusty.,1,How I Met Your Mother,61,9
2484,Ted,8," Yeah, no, it did. I mean, I kinda liked the rusty taste. I'm used to it. I don't know.",1,How I Met Your Mother,87,19
2485,Marshall,8," Also Lily's coffeemaker doesn't, you know, shock you.",1,How I Met Your Mother,54,8
2486,Ted,8," No. You gotta admit, that shock, wakes you up in the morning",1,How I Met Your Mother,61,12
2487,Marshall,8, You know what else wakes you up in the morning? Coffee.,1,How I Met Your Mother,56,11
2488,Ted,8, That's great. You're right. Roomies! I love it.,1,How I Met Your Mother,48,8
2491,Ted,8, They're edging me out. They're totally edging me out. I didn't' believe it but you're right.,1,How I Met Your Mother,93,16
2492,Barney,8," Told you. That Lily, she's a shrewd one.",1,How I Met Your Mother,41,8
2493,Robin,8," Yeah, she got you a nice new coffeemaker. How dare she!",1,How I Met Your Mother,56,11
2494,Ted,8, It's not just the coffeemaker.,1,How I Met Your Mother,31,5
2497,Lily,8, Done. The painting's done.,1,How I Met Your Mother,27,4
2498,Marshall,8, That is great.,1,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
2499,Ted,8, Nice.,1,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
2500,Marshall,8, Where do you wanna hang it?,1,How I Met Your Mother,28,6
2501,Lily,8," I don't know. Um, over the piano?",1,How I Met Your Mother,34,7
2502,Ted,8," Yeah, that would be a good place for it. Too bad the swords are there. We kinda love those swords.",1,How I Met Your Mother,99,20
2503,Marshall,8," Well, those swords have been up there a long time.",1,How I Met Your Mother,51,10
2504,Ted,8," I know, right? I'd really miss them too. So, maybe Marshall's room?",1,How I Met Your Mother,68,12
2505,Lily,8, OK.,1,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
2508,Ted,8, He was gonna take the swords down. Can you believe that?,1,How I Met Your Mother,57,11
2509,Robin,8," Ted, why don't you just talk to him? He's your best friend.",1,How I Met Your Mother,60,12
2511,Robin,8," One of your best friends. The point is, maybe it's time for some healthy communication.",1,How I Met Your Mother,88,15
2512,Barney,8," Healthy communication? That's the worst idea ever. Look, you held off their first advance. That's good. Now it's time to counter-strike.",1,How I Met Your Mother,137,21
2513,Ted,8," Yeah, well, what am I supposed to do?",1,How I Met Your Mother,38,8
2514,Barney,8," You gotta mark your territory, and I don't mean missing the toilet. You gotta do something big.",1,How I Met Your Mother,96,17
2515,Ted,8," What, like buy a new sofa?",1,How I Met Your Mother,27,6
2516,Barney,8, Bigger.,1,How I Met Your Mother,8,1

2519,Robin,8," A lemon law, like for cars.",1,How I Met Your Mother,28,6
2520,Barney,8," Exactly. From the moment the date begins you have five minutes to decide whether you're going to commit to an entire evening. And if you don't, it's no hard feelings just good night, thanks for playing, see you never. Huh? Huh? The lemon law, it's gonna be a thing, possibly starting right now.",1,How I Met Your Mother,295,53

2528,Barney,8, It's gonna be a thing.,1,How I Met Your Mother,23,5
2532,Lily,8," Man, Ted's been acting weird. He started labeling all his food. He even carved ""Ted"" into that block of cheese.",1,How I Met Your Mother,112,20
2533,Marshall,8," Yeah. Well, now it's Ed's.",1,How I Met Your Mother,27,5
2534,Lily,8, He's not cool with me moving in.,1,How I Met Your Mother,33,7
2535,Marshall,8," No, that's not it. I mean, you basically lived here all along. Ted loves you.",1,How I Met Your Mother,78,15
2536,Lily,8," So, what's he PMS'ing about?",1,How I Met Your Mother,29,5
2538,Marshall,8, I don't know. But when he's ready to talk to me about it he'll come and talk to me about it.,1,How I Met Your Mother,93,21
2539,Lily,8, Are you kidding? You guys never talk about anything.,1,How I Met Your Mother,53,9
2541,Lily,8, He'll just let it fester under the surface until he does something big and passive-aggressive.,1,How I Met Your Mother,95,15
2542,Marshall,8, You clearly don't know Ted.,1,How I Met Your Mother,28,5
2547,Marshall,8, Your English phone booth arrived.,1,How I Met Your Mother,34,5
2548,Ted,8," Oh, awesome. It's great, right?",1,How I Met Your Mother,32,5
2549,Marshall,8," Yeah, I guess. Just not sure if Lily's gonna like it.",1,How I Met Your Mother,54,11
2550,Ted,8," Well, I like it, so I'm just gonna keep it right here, if that's cool.",1,How I Met Your Mother,71,15
2551,Marshall,8," Of course, we all live here so we should all be able to have things the way we want them.",1,How I Met Your Mother,90,20
2552,Ted,8, Exactly.,1,How I Met Your Mother,9,1
2553,Marshall,8, Great,1,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
2554,Marshall,8, Terrific.,1,How I Met Your Mother,10,1
2556,Marshall,8, You like the phone booth. It stays. I like this painting so I'm just gonna hang it...right here on the wall.,1,How I Met Your Mother,109,21
2558,Ted,8," Oh, so it's like that, is it?",1,How I Met Your Mother,30,7
2559,Marshall,8," Bring, bring.",1,How I Met Your Mother,14,2

2565,Marshall,8," Well, I want it too.",1,How I Met Your Mother,21,5
2570,Barney,8," No, I'm a visionary. Lemon law, it's gonna be a thing!",1,How I Met Your Mother,55,11
2572,Robin,8," For the record, your little lemon law is a symbol of everything that's wrong with our no-attention span society.",1,How I Met Your Mother,113,19
2573,Barney,8," No, wrong, lemon law is awesome.",1,How I Met Your Mother,33,6
2574,Robin,8," It takes longer than five minutes to really get to know someone. You keep giving up on people so quickly, you're gonna miss out on something great.",1,How I Met Your Mother,148,27
2575,Barney,8," OK, you're on a blind date, sitting across the table is that guy.",1,How I Met Your Mother,66,13
2577,Barney,8, You really think it'll take more than five minutes to realize there will be no date number two?,1,How I Met Your Mother,96,18
2578,Robin,8," Yes I do. For all I know, that guy's my soul-mate.",1,How I Met Your Mother,51,11
2579,Barney,8," Bad move, Scherbatsky.",1,How I Met Your Mother,23,3

2583,Robin,8, Hi.,1,How I Met Your Mother,4,1

2594,Ted,8," I'm flipping. But before I do, I just wanna say something. You didn't even wanna move in here in the first place. You said a pre-war building was bad for your allergies.",1,How I Met Your Mother,170,32
2595,Marshall,8, That was five years ago. Now you can get prescription-level antihistamines over the counter. Oh snap. What else you got?,1,How I Met Your Mother,121,20
2596,Ted,8," OK, I'm flipping. Heads or tails.",1,How I Met Your Mother,34,6

2598,Ted,8," Heads or tails, Marshall. Like you need two rooms?",1,How I Met Your Mother,51,9
2599,Marshall,8, We might be starting a family soon.,1,How I Met Your Mother,36,7

2601,Marshall,8," It could be sooner, we're not that careful with our birth control Two-zip.",1,How I Met Your Mother,75,13
2602,Ted,8," Oh, come on, you know damn well I move out that room's going unused.",1,How I Met Your Mother,69,14

2604,Ted,8," Yeah, well, at least Barney wouldn't take the swords down.",1,How I Met Your Mother,59,10

2607,Marshall,8," My fiancí©...suddenly, she's my fiancí©.",1,How I Met Your Mother,41,5

2620,Marshall,8, We should probably figure that out.,1,How I Met Your Mother,36,6
2622,Ted,8," It's OK, it's OK.",1,How I Met Your Mother,18,4
2624,Ted,8, Can I observe something?,1,How I Met Your Mother,25,4

2659,Ted,8," OK, but this time, jump up and I'll swipe your legs.",1,How I Met Your Mother,53,11
2661,Ted,8," Look. Here's why I should get the place. You and Lily, you get to be married. What do I get, right? I get to be unmarried, alone, minus two roommates. And on top of that I could be homeless. Does that seem fair?",1,How I Met Your Mother,212,43
2662,Marshall,8," Oh, boo-freakin-hoo.",1,How I Met Your Mother,21,2
2663,Ted,8, What?,1,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
2664,Marshall,8," Woe is me. I'm not married yet. My ovaries are shrinking. Ted, if you wanted to be married by now you would be but you're not. And you know why? Because you're irrationally picky. You're easily distracted and you're utterly anhedonic.",1,How I Met Your Mother,235,41
2665,Ted,8, Anhedonic?,1,How I Met Your Mother,11,1
2666,Marshall,8, Anhedonic. It means you can't enjoy anything.,1,How I Met Your Mother,46,7
2667,Ted,8, The hell I can't. I'm enjoying this.,1,How I Met Your Mother,37,7
2668,Marshall,8," I know, this rules.",1,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
2670,Marshall,8," Hey, I'm sorry I took the swords down.",1,How I Met Your Mother,39,8
2671,Ted,8," That's OK, it led to this totally rad sword fight, didn't it?",1,How I Met Your Mother,62,12
2672,Marshall,8, Yeah it did.,1,How I Met Your Mother,13,3
2674,Marshall,8, You remember when we first got these swords?,1,How I Met Your Mother,45,8

2691,Marshall,8, I stabbed Lily. I stabbed my fiancí©.,1,How I Met Your Mother,38,7
2692,Ted,8," Come on, Marshall, do you really think she's still your fiancí©? I'm kidding. Hey, I think you guys should have the apartment. Marshall",1,How I Met Your Mother,136,23
2693,Ted,8," I wasn't fighting for the apartment. I was fighting for...I don't know...for everything to stay the way it is. But I'm not gonna get that, so, seriously, take the place, it's yours.",1,How I Met Your Mother,182,32

2717,Marshall,8," Well, just to be fair, it didn't go all the way through.",1,How I Met Your Mother,57,12
2718,Lily,8," I'm sorry, is this a discussion of the degree to which you stabbed me?",1,How I Met Your Mother,71,14

2975,Lily,9," Oh, so is New York.",1,How I Met Your Mother,20,5
2977,Lily,9, What? It is. And we grew up just fine. And we grew to the proper size and then we stopped.,1,How I Met Your Mother,91,20

3039,Ted,9, Mushrooms. Mushrooms. Portobello mushrooms for everybody! Take them and run! They're very expensive!,1,How I Met Your Mother,101,13
3043,Lily,9," Happy Thanksgiving. As in check out the chick buying the knock-up test everybody, wonder what must be going through her head.

3055,Robin,9, Apparently you can. And his two non-mushroom-throwing friends.,1,How I Met Your Mother,63,8
3057,Barney,9, I can't believe that I told Kendall you guys were cool. I had 40 hours left on my community service and now I've got to spend it spearing trash on a freaking median strip.,1,How I Met Your Mother,172,34
3059,Barney,9, Volunteer of the year!,1,How I Met Your Mother,23,4

3082,Lily,9, Just promise.,1,How I Met Your Mother,14,2
3083,Marshall,9, Why do you want me to promise you that?,1,How I Met Your Mother,40,9
3085,Lily,9, Because I don't fit in here. I'm not eight feet tall and I don't think you can call it a salad if it has Funyuns in it.,1,How I Met Your Mother,120,27
3086,Marshall,9," I'm Funyuns and mayonnaise and gummy bears and baskiceball and I love St. Cloud. And yes, there is a part of me that would like to move here someday, and why are we having this discussion in a jail cell on Thanksgiving?",1,How I Met Your Mother,220,42
3090,Lily,9, Pete arrested me before I could look at it.,1,How I Met Your Mother,44,9
3092,Marshall,9, Whoa.,1,How I Met Your Mother,6,1

3095,Lily,9," Yeah, what are the rules to that game, anyway? Marshall",1,How I Met Your Mother,56,10
3097,Marshall,9," Look, I don't wanna be exactly like my family, and don't take this the wrong way, but I don't wanna be exactly like your family either.",1,How I Met Your Mother,136,26
3100,Lily,9," Great, now I'm crying. Look, we may have some really big decisions to make in about 10 seconds but right now, I don't care where our kids grow up as long as they have you for a father.",1,How I Met Your Mother,185,38
3102,Lily,9," Gosh, I hope you're the father. Just a little joke to lighten up the mood.",1,How I Met Your Mother,75,15

3110,Robin,9, Ted. Are you listening? You're a good guy.,1,How I Met Your Mother,43,8

3113,Barney,9," OK, Ted, I found a way for you to help someone, to do some good. This is Walter, and Walter is homeless. And Walter would like a lap dance.",1,How I Met Your Mother,140,29
3114,Ted,9, Are you joking?,1,How I Met Your Mother,16,3
3115,Barney,9, I never joke about the sublime art of burlesque entertainment.,1,How I Met Your Mother,63,10
3116,Ted,9," No, Barney, that's insane. Sir, would you like me to buy you a ticket to the buffet.",1,How I Met Your Mother,85,17
3118,Barney,9," Ted, Walter's been to three shelter dinners. You know where he hasn't been? To heaven with Samantha. Look, it's the one chance you've had all day to help someone in need. Now buy this man a lap dance.",1,How I Met Your Mother,201,38
3119,Robin,9, You said you wanted to see the joy in someone's eyes.,1,How I Met Your Mother,54,11
3120,Ted,9," You know, I don't think I'm gonna watch.",1,How I Met Your Mother,41,8
3121,Ted,9," Here you go, Walter. Happy Thanksgiving.",1,How I Met Your Mother,41,6
3124,Ted,9," Happy Thanksgiving, guys.",1,How I Met Your Mother,26,3

3154,Lily,10, I hope not.,1,How I Met Your Mother,12,3
3155,Barney,10," No, no.",1,How I Met Your Mother,8,2
3156,Lily,10, These look kinda like blood.,1,How I Met Your Mother,29,5
3157,Marshall,10," OK, I know that you've all dismissed this theory before, but is there any chance that Carl is a vampire?",1,How I Met Your Mother,105,20
3158,Barney,10, That's ridiculous.,1,How I Met Your Mother,19,2
3159,Marshall,10," I'm serious. Think about it. He always wears black, we never see him in the daylight, only after dark.",1,How I Met Your Mother,103,19
3160,Robin,10," Oh my God, that does describe a vampire, or you know, a bartender.",1,How I Met Your Mother,67,13

3166,Ted,10," Wait, you're really going out with a billionaire?",1,How I Met Your Mother,50,8
3167,Robin,10, He's not a billionaire. He's a hundred millionaire. Why do people always round up?,1,How I Met Your Mother,83,14
3168,Ted,10," So, uh, where's Thurston Howell taking you?",1,How I Met Your Mother,44,7

3172,Barney,10, You gonna put out?,1,How I Met Your Mother,19,4
3174,Barney,10, What? There's only one reason he's taking her to this dinner and it's not so little Mutu can get his malaria pills.,1,How I Met Your Mother,116,22
3175,Lily,10, I think my soul just threw up a little bit.,1,How I Met Your Mother,44,10

3182,Marshall,10, I don't know. Girl of your dreams dating a billionaire.,1,How I Met Your Mother,56,10
3183,Ted,10," OK, first of all, hundred millionaire. And second, she's not the girl of my dreams. We're just friend. Look, it would not be smart if we got together. I mean, I'm looking to settle down. She's looking for...",1,How I Met Your Mother,208,38
3185,Barney,10, What? You done? Great. Check out table number four. See that little hottie on the end. She's short but has an ample bosom. I love it. She's like half-boob. Let's go.,1,How I Met Your Mother,166,31

3192,Barney,10," Hm. Yeah, I think it's pretty solid.",1,How I Met Your Mother,37,7

3200,Ted,10, That worked. I hate the world.,1,How I Met Your Mother,31,6

3207,Marshall,10, Interesting,1,How I Met Your Mother,12,1
3208,Barney,10," Ted, I believe you and I met for a reason. It's like the universe was saying, hey, Barney, there's this dude, he's pretty cool but it's your job to make him awesome. Your brain screws you up, Ted. It gets in the way. It happened with Robin, it happened with half-boob. And it's gonna keep on happening until you power down that bucket of neuroses inebriation-style.",1,How I Met Your Mother,366,66
3209,Ted,10," So, what? You want me to do a shot.",1,How I Met Your Mother,36,9

3216,Ted,10," Ah, Lily, will you tell these guys how stupid they're being?",1,How I Met Your Mother,61,11
3217,Lily,10," Guys, you are being immature and moronic and drink, drink, drink",1,How I Met Your Mother,65,11
3221,Ted,10," Let me tell you something about this brain, OK?",1,How I Met Your Mother,48,9

3266,Marshall,10," Oh, bad idea.",1,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
3267,Barney,10," No, no, that's a great idea. That's the whole point of getting drunk. You do things you would never do in a million years if you were sober.",1,How I Met Your Mother,141,28
3268,Lily,10, Says every girl you've ever slept with.,1,How I Met Your Mother,40,7

3282,Robin,10," Listen, Ted, I can't really talk right... '93? Dude, that's impressive.",1,How I Met Your Mother,72,11
3284,Ted,10," I don't say this enough, but you're a great woman, and a great reporter. You should be on 60 Minutes. You should be one of the minutes.",1,How I Met Your Mother,136,27
3286,Robin,10, That's sweet and odd. But I'm kinda on a date right now.,1,How I Met Your Mother,57,12
3288,Ted,10," Yeah, and I disagree with Barney. Just 'cause this guy is spending a lot of money doesn't mean you have to put out. Take it slow, Robin, take it slow. Slow.",1,How I Met Your Mother,157,31

3571,Ted,10," Whatever, whatever. I don't care what you think.",1,How I Met Your Mother,49,8

3596,Lily,11, By who? Who asks you that?,1,How I Met Your Mother,27,6
3597,Barney,11," And the answer is right here... my own, personal ""get psyched"" mix. Now, people often think a good mix should rise and fall, but people are wrong. It should be all rise, baby. Now prepare yourselves for an audio journey into the white-hot center of adrenaline. Bam.",1,How I Met Your Mother,266,47

3634,Lily,11," Okay, I love these shoes, but the pain-to-hotness ratio is pretty steep. Can we swing by the apartment, so I can change?",1,How I Met Your Mother,121,22

3778,Lily,11, I wish Marshall would call. I guess the circuits are jammed.,1,How I Met Your Mother,61,11
3779,Barney,11," Yeah, you know why all the circuits are jammed because everyone's calling their loved ones, everyone around the world. Everyone except Barney. Oh, sure, laugh. Laugh for Barney Stinson. Laugh for the sad clown trapped on his whirling carousel of suits and cigars and bimbos and booze. Round and round it goes. And where's it all heading? Nowhere.",1,How I Met Your Mother,347,58
3780,Robin,11," Is this just 'cause you lost your ""Get Psyched"" mix?",1,How I Met Your Mother,53,10

3841,Marshall,11, Three minutes!,1,How I Met Your Mother,15,2

3869,Barney,12," Ted, have you ignored all my teachings? Ted",1,How I Met Your Mother,44,8
3870,Barney,12," You don't bring a date to a wedding. That's like bringing a deer carcass on a hunting trip. Oh Ted, oh Ted, no, no date.",1,How I Met Your Mother,121,25
3871,Ted,12," Deer carcass, really? That's the metaphor you're going for?",1,How I Met Your Mother,60,9
3872,Barney,12," Ted, it's a simile.",1,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
3873,Ted,12," Well, it's too late now. If I don't bring a date, a $200 piece of chicken-slash-salmon will go uneaten. I gotta bring someone, but who?",1,How I Met Your Mother,136,25

3885,Robin,12," Never really clicked. I felt bad though, he was pretty bummed.",1,How I Met Your Mother,63,11
3886,Barney,12," Don't beat yourself up. He'll be fine. I mean, the guy's like a billionaire. He can put his platinum card on a fishing line and reel in 10 chicks hotter than you.",1,How I Met Your Mother,163,32
3887,Robin,12," Thanks, I feel a lot better. Think I'll get that drink now.",1,How I Met Your Mother,60,12

3901,Ted,12, I need a date to this wedding. Wish me luck,1,How I Met Your Mother,44,10

3904,Marshall,12," This wedding does sound pretty amazing though. Fancy hotel ballroom, everybody all dressed up.",1,How I Met Your Mother,95,14
3905,Lily,12," Ah, here we go.",1,How I Met Your Mother,16,4
3906,Barney,12, What?,1,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
3907,Lily,12, We can't get anywhere with our wedding plans because I want it to be fun and Marshall wants it to be lame.,1,How I Met Your Mother,107,22
3908,Marshall,12," Oh yeah, OK, that's a pretty fair assessment of our two arguments.",1,How I Met Your Mother,67,12
3909,Lily,12, I thought so.,1,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
3910,Marshall,12," You know what, excuse me if I don't wanna get married barefoot in the woods next to Lake No-one's-gonna-drive-that-far. Yes, I want a ballroom and I want a band and I want shoes.",1,How I Met Your Mother,179,33

3917,Lily,12," Right. But I'm the bride, so I win.",1,How I Met Your Mother,36,8
3918,Barney,12," Seriously, Claudia and Stuart?! I mean, I've hooked up with the odd lass who was beneath my level of attractiveness, but, you know, I was drunk. There's no way Claudia has been drunk for three years.",1,How I Met Your Mother,200,36
3920,Ted,12," You know, I've always found that the best way to get over a failed relationship is to celebrate someone else's successful one.",1,How I Met Your Mother,127,22
3921,Robin,12," Well, makes sense.",1,How I Met Your Mother,19,3
3922,Ted,12," So, with that mind, our friends Claudia and Stuart are having this crazy, black-tie wedding on Saturday. You wanna be my 'plus one'?",1,How I Met Your Mother,133,23

3928,Robin,12," Lily, I need a dress.",1,How I Met Your Mother,22,5
3929,Lily,12," You're going. That's awesome. Oh my God, four days to find a dress?",1,How I Met Your Mother,68,13
3930,Robin,12," I know, it's a suicide mission.",1,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
3931,Lily,12," Well, if we leave now, we can still have a fighting chance. Let's do it.",1,How I Met Your Mother,73,15
3933,Marshall,12, Bye babe.,1,How I Met Your Mother,10,2
3934,Ted,12," Whoa, did you see how fired up she was? I don't know, there's something there. And come Saturday, a little music, a little dancing, a lot of champagne. Who knows? Barney",1,How I Met Your Mother,170,31

3974,Barney,12," Yeah, I don't think you did. You know why? Because deep down, you didn't want to show up at this thing with a date.

4009,Lily,12, What?,1,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
4010,Ted,12, I ran into Claudia and she told me I didn't check 'plus one' on the reply card.,1,How I Met Your Mother,80,17

4146,Marshall,12," I'm sorry. Being in a couple is hard and committing, making sacrifices, it's hard. But if it's the right person, then it's easy.

4342,Ted,13, I will use exactly the right amount of tongue.,1,How I Met Your Mother,47,9
4344,Ted,13, OK.,1,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
4346,Ted,13, OK.,1,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
4349,Marshall,13," A drumroll? That's it. So, what, you just said good-night, came home, and performed a drum solo?",1,How I Met Your Mother,97,17
4350,Lily,13," Oh, Ted, you're such a doof. I mean, this girl sounds amazing.",1,How I Met Your Mother,63,12
4351,Ted,13," She was completely amazing. She was amazing and funny and we connected on every level. And, I'm never gonna see her again.",1,How I Met Your Mother,123,22
4353,Ted,13," Dammit, I have to see her again.",1,How I Met Your Mother,33,7
4355,Marshall,13," So, let's get to work, man. What else do you know about her?",1,How I Met Your Mother,61,13
4356,Ted,13," Nothing. Her name's Victoria, that's all I got. Wait, Claudia, Claudia would know.",1,How I Met Your Mother,83,13
4357,Lily,13," Well, Claudia's on her honeymoon. She'll be back in two weeks. Call her then.",1,How I Met Your Mother,78,14

4379,Ted,13, Thank God.,1,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
4385,Ted,13, There was no Victoria at the wedding.,1,How I Met Your Mother,38,7
4386,Lily,13," Maybe she used a second fake name. Oh, she's good, she's very good.",1,How I Met Your Mother,68,13
4387,Marshall,13," Maybe she was a ghost. That's why she didn't wanna kiss you, because you'd just pass right through her and feel really cold for a second. Oh my God, I just had a great idea for a screenplay.",1,How I Met Your Mother,191,38
4388,Ted,13, Marshall. She was not a ghost.,1,How I Met Your Mother,31,6
4389,Marshall,13," I know that she wasn't a ghost, she picked up a bouquet, proving she had corporeal form.",1,How I Met Your Mother,89,17
4390,Ted,13," Wait, wait, wait, she was sitting across from a couple of bridesmaids. She must have been at their table. Maybe they know who she was?",1,How I Met Your Mother,135,25
4391,Lily,13, Great. How do we get in touch with the bridesmaids?,1,How I Met Your Mother,52,10

4399,Barney,13, Ow. I know the house rules. Es un chiste.,1,How I Met Your Mother,42,9
4401,Ted,13," Uh, listen, Barney, I saw you talking to that bridesmaid last night. Did you happen to get her phone number?",1,How I Met Your Mother,109,20
4403,Barney,13, You know I did.,1,How I Met Your Mother,16,4
4405,Ted,13, Great. I'm gonna need you to call her for me.,1,How I Met Your Mother,46,10
4407,Barney,13, You know I won't.,1,How I Met Your Mother,18,4
4409,Ted,13, Why not?,1,How I Met Your Mother,9,2
4412,Barney,13," Because we just hooked up last night. I can't call the girl the next day. I have to wait at least, like, forever. Oh snap. Never gonna call her. Besides, she thinks I'm on my way to India.",1,How I Met Your Mother,189,38
4413,Lily,13," Oh, come on, Barney. It's for a good cause.",1,How I Met Your Mother,44,9
4414,Barney,13," Ted going all castrati over another girl is exactly not a good cause. Sorry, buddy, I wish I could help you, my hands are tied. Oh no, wait, that was last night.",1,How I Met Your Mother,162,32
4416,Ted,13," OK, Barney, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. You make this call and I will go with you to Foxy Boxing.",1,How I Met Your Mother,103,22
4417,Barney,13, Really? Ted,1,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
4418,Barney,13, But you always said that Foxy Boxing girls were neither foxy nor good at boxing.,1,How I Met Your Mother,81,15
4419,Ted,13, I'm ready to be proven wrong.,1,How I Met Your Mother,30,6
4420,Barney,13, Tonight? Ted,1,How I Met Your Mother,13,2
4421,Barney,13,"  Yeah, Tanya, turns out I don't leave for the Peace Corps until tomorrow. Yeah, I know, sucks. Just one fewer day I get to help people. Anyway, this girl, any idea who she was? Hold on.",1,How I Met Your Mother,186,36
4422,Barney,13,  What kind of shoes...,1,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
4423,Barney,13,"  Tanya, he's a dude. He's not gonna know what kind of shoes she was wearing.",1,How I Met Your Mother,77,15
4424,Ted,13, Actually.,1,How I Met Your Mother,10,1
4425,Barney,13, Oh come on.,1,How I Met Your Mother,12,3
4429,Ted,13," So, what do you want to do next?",1,How I Met Your Mother,33,8
4431,Ted,13, Don't think...first thing that comes into your mind.,1,How I Met Your Mother,53,8
4434,Ted,13, Whoa. There she goes.,1,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
4436,Barney,13,  Apparently she was wearing brown shoes with little snowflakes on them.,1,How I Met Your Mother,72,11
4439,Barney,13," Sorry, Ted, I won't be able to make foxy boxing tonight.",1,How I Met Your Mother,57,11
4440,Ted,13, I understand.,1,How I Met Your Mother,14,2
4441,Lily,13," OK, let's not lose hope. We'll call the hotel, maybe she was staying there. We'll have them check the registry for anyone named Victoria. Or maybe she goes by Vicky or Tori...",1,How I Met Your Mother,176,32
4442,Marshall,13, Or Ictor. Probably doesn't go by Ictor.,1,How I Met Your Mother,40,7
4443,Ted,13," No, you know what? This is fate. I am never supposed to see this girl again. That was the whole point of the night. I've just been saved from myself. Let's drink many beers.",1,How I Met Your Mother,174,34
4444,Marshall,13, Agreed.,1,How I Met Your Mother,8,1
4449,Lily,13," Hey, there's the anchor lady! How was it?",1,How I Met Your Mother,42,8
4450,Robin,13," Oh, I don't know. Why don't you ask the new substitute weekend anchor. Robin? Thanks, Robin, it was awesome. Back to you, Robin.",1,How I Met Your Mother,129,23
4451,Lily,13," Congrats, that's so cool.",1,How I Met Your Mother,26,4
4453,Robin,13," Yeah, I felt really bad bailing on Ted though.",1,How I Met Your Mother,47,9
4454,Lily,13," Oh, don't even worry about it. In fact...",1,How I Met Your Mother,42,8
4458,Lily,13, What?,1,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
4459,Robin,13, I know who she is.,1,How I Met Your Mother,19,5
4460,Lily,13," You know who she is? But, you weren't even at the wedding.",1,How I Met Your Mother,59,12
4461,Robin,13," Actually, I kind of was.",1,How I Met Your Mother,25,5
4462,Lily,13, What?,1,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
4463,Robin,13," Well, after the newscast, I was so excited, I decided to surprise Ted by going to the reception.",1,How I Met Your Mother,97,18
4465,Robin,13, Dammit. Stop it. What the hell?,1,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
4467,Robin,13," Uh, yeah, I'm fine. Just allergies or something. I'm fine.",1,How I Met Your Mother,59,10
4469,Robin,13," Oh, thanks, but I don't actually cry in front of people, or cry at all for that matter. Man, it's gross. Does everyone snot up this much when they cry?",1,How I Met Your Mother,152,30
4472,Lily,13, Because you have feelings for Ted.,1,How I Met Your Mother,35,6
4473,Robin,13," I don't know, maybe.",1,How I Met Your Mother,21,4
4474,Lily,13," OK, what is wrong with the two of you?! Seriously. He likes you and you like him, just, just, just be together. Geez, Louise, happiness is not that difficult.",1,How I Met Your Mother,159,29
4475,Robin,13," Oh, look, OK. Yes, I cried in the bathroom, and that was weird. But that doesn't mean I'm in love with the guy. The fact is I don't know how I feel.",1,How I Met Your Mother,149,32
4476,Lily,13, Yes you do. Seeing him with someone else and crying about it. Guess what? That's how you feel. That is nothing but how you feel.,1,How I Met Your Mother,129,25
4477,Robin,13," OK, fine, I have feelings for him. Happy? Lily",1,How I Met Your Mother,47,9
4478,Robin,13, But it doesn't change anything. I still don't wanna get married and he's still... Ted. What I should do is just tell him who Victoria is so he could be happy.,1,How I Met Your Mother,159,31
4479,Lily,13, Or you could tell him you're into him and then you could both be happy.,1,How I Met Your Mother,72,15
4480,Robin,13, I'm gonna go find him.,1,How I Met Your Mother,23,5
4482,Lily,13," Well, wait. Which one are you gonna tell him?",1,How I Met Your Mother,46,9
4483,Robin,13, I have no idea.,1,How I Met Your Mother,16,4
4486,Barney,13," And here's the most amazing part. Because I told her I converted all my money to India dollars, she gave me fifty bucks to take a cab to the airport. That's right, I just got paid for s*x.",1,How I Met Your Mother,189,38
4488,Barney,13, I really should give this money to the Peace Corps. They've done so much for me lately.,1,How I Met Your Mother,88,17
4490,Robin,13," Hi, guys,",1,How I Met Your Mother,10,2
4491,Ted,13, Hey.,1,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
4492,Robin,13," Um, Ted, can I talk to you outside for a second?",1,How I Met Your Mother,49,11

4509,Ted,13," Oh, um, Marshall wanted to know where you guys got that cake.",1,How I Met Your Mother,62,12
4514,Robin,13," Thanks. You're very sweet. So, are you a friend of the bride or groom?",1,How I Met Your Mother,71,14

4531,Ted,13, I'm going down to that bakery.,1,How I Met Your Mother,31,6

4533,Marshall,13," Baby, what are you talking about?!",1,How I Met Your Mother,35,6
4534,Ted,13," Yeah, all day long, you've been busting my apple bag about finding this girl.",1,How I Met Your Mother,78,14

4547,Ted,13," Damn, he's looking mighty fine in that tux.",1,How I Met Your Mother,44,8
4549,Ted,13," You know, I don't look like this every day. On a real weekend, the real Ted wears a pair of jeans and a sweatshirt with bleach stains on it.",1,How I Met Your Mother,141,29
4554,Lily,13, Buttercup Bakery. This is it.,1,How I Met Your Mother,30,5
4555,Marshall,13," Good luck, dude. Grab me a cupcake.",1,How I Met Your Mother,36,7

4568,Ted,13," One, two, three, four, five.",1,How I Met Your Mother,29,5
4571,Ted,13," And to our dying day, we will remember everything about that night as perfect. Maybe we both need that. So many things go wrong in life, but this is the one thing that never will. It'll always, always be pure, unadulterated awesome. If I walk in there, I'm robbing both of us of what could be...",1,How I Met Your Mother,296,56
4572,Barney,13," The meter's running, dude. Crap or get off the pot.",1,How I Met Your Mother,52,10
4573,Ted,13, OK.,1,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
4581,Marshall,14," They have to come out soon, it's Monday.",1,How I Met Your Mother,41,8
4582,Lily,14, Do you think they've been in there the whole time? I don't know whether to be proud or concerned.,1,How I Met Your Mother,98,19
4583,Marshall,14, Maybe they're not even in there.,1,How I Met Your Mother,33,6
4586,Ted,14," Hey, guys.",1,How I Met Your Mother,11,2

4597,Ted,14, Zero.,1,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
4598,Marshall,14, What?,1,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
4599,Lily,14, What?,1,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
4600,Ted,14," Guys, we just met. And we both screwed up relationships in the past by jumping in too quick, so we talked about it, and we decided to take this one slow.",1,How I Met Your Mother,154,31
4601,Marshall,14, Her idea.,1,How I Met Your Mother,10,2

4608,Lily,14, Burn!,1,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
4609,Barney,14," Ted, the only reason to wait a month for s*x is if the girl is 17 years, 11 months old.",1,How I Met Your Mother,88,20
4610,Robin,14, Good news,1,How I Met Your Mother,10,2
4611,Ted,14," Oh, I can't, I'm taking Victoria out for dinner.",1,How I Met Your Mother,49,9

4663,Lily,14, But I don't want to hide out in here.,1,How I Met Your Mother,38,9
4664,Marshall,14," Honey, Ted has been going out of his mind waiting for this. If we go out there and spoil the mood, it's not going to happen. Then one of us is going to have to have s*x with Ted, and... not going to be me.",1,How I Met Your Mother,206,45
4665,Lily,14," Okay, fine. I guess I'll actually floss.",1,How I Met Your Mother,41,7
4667,Barney,14, You suited up!,1,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
4668,Robin,14," Well, I figured if I'm going to do this, I'm going to do this right.",1,How I Met Your Mother,69,15
4669,Barney,14, Emilio? The woman will have...,1,How I Met Your Mother,31,5
4670,Robin,14," I'll have a Johnny Walker Blue, neat, and a Montecristo No. 2 Thanks.",1,How I Met Your Mother,70,13
4671,Barney,14," Ah, the No. 2, a.k.a. ""The Torpedo."" Or, as the rollers call it, ""Piramide.""",1,How I Met Your Mother,77,14
4672,Robin,14," My father was a cigar fanatic, it was the only way to get his attention.",1,How I Met Your Mother,73,15
4673,Barney,14, Father issues. Hot.,1,How I Met Your Mother,20,3
4674,Robin,14, I know... I was this close to being a huge slut.,1,How I Met Your Mother,49,11
4675,Barney,14," Slut would have been better, but I'll settle for bro. Especially now that Ted's with Victoria and can't drink. Because he's pregnant. Cause he's the girl.",1,How I Met Your Mother,155,26
4676,Robin,14," Oh, come on, Ted can't be pregnant. You need to have s*x to get pregnant.",1,How I Met Your Mother,74,15
4677,Barney,14, What up! Freeze frame high five!,1,How I Met Your Mother,33,6
4680,Ted,14," No. Because the beauty of a moment is that it's fleeting. By its very nature, it... slips through our fingers... making it that much more precious.",1,How I Met Your Mother,148,26
4682,Lily,14," Ugh, that is bad. That is, like, high-school-literary-magazine bad.",1,How I Met Your Mother,68,9
4683,Marshall,14, And they're not even high.,1,How I Met Your Mother,27,5
4684,Lily,14, It's actually working.,1,How I Met Your Mother,23,3
4685,Marshall,14," Yeah, smooth but slowly. God, close the deal, already. It's been, like, 45 minutes... we could have had s*x three times by now.",1,How I Met Your Mother,128,23
4686,Lily,14," Yeah, try five.",1,How I Met Your Mother,16,3
4687,Marshall,14, What up! Maybe we should just go out there.,1,How I Met Your Mother,44,9
4688,Lily,14, No way! We can't go out there now. They'll know that we've been sitting in the bathroom the whole time. It'll be too weird.,1,How I Met Your Mother,124,24
4689,Marshall,14, Fine. But if we're stuck in here... I'm turning up the volume. Shh. Shh.,1,How I Met Your Mother,73,14
4692,Lily,14," Honey, could you hold my hair back, I think I'm going to hurl.",1,How I Met Your Mother,63,13
4694,Robin,14, So. What do you and Ted usually do after the cigar bar?,1,How I Met Your Mother,56,12
4695,Barney,14, Are you kidding? Ted's never been here. You've already flown higher and faster than he ever did. Still...,1,How I Met Your Mother,106,18
4696,Robin,14, What?,1,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
4697,Barney,14, There is one other thing we could do. If you're up for it.,1,How I Met Your Mother,59,13
4699,Robin,14," Oh, I had no idea laser tag still existed!",1,How I Met Your Mother,43,9
4700,Barney,14," Yeah, well, enjoy it before it becomes cool again. I give it two months.",1,How I Met Your Mother,73,14
4701,Robin,14," Oh, I believe it... this is awesome!",1,How I Met Your Mother,37,7
4702,Barney,14," Okay, follow my lead, stay low, and never underestimate a 12-year-old with a... Scherbotsky, you have to focus! You just saved my life, didn't you?",1,How I Met Your Mother,148,25
4703,Robin,14, Thank me later. Let's keep moving. These little bastards are everywhere.,1,How I Met Your Mother,73,11
4705,Marshall,14, He's just staring into her eyes.,1,How I Met Your Mother,33,6
4706,Lily,14," I don't know, we used to be even more nauseatingly into each other than Ted and Victoria. Now look at us.",1,How I Met Your Mother,106,21
4707,Marshall,14, Yeah... now we just make fun of people like that. It's the circle of life.,1,How I Met Your Mother,75,15
4708,Lily,14," No, I'm serious, Marshall. I mean, we couldn't even get it up to go on our big trip. And now we're celebrating our anniversary stuck in a bathroom.",1,How I Met Your Mother,148,28
4709,Marshall,14," Well, it's not fair to compare us to Ted and Victoria. This is their first time.",1,How I Met Your Mother,81,16
4710,Lily,14," Yeah, but we could still have some more romance. Now, you just say, ""Want to do it?"" And I say, ""Yeah.""",1,How I Met Your Mother,104,21
4711,Marshall,14, Want to...,1,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
4712,Lily,14, No! Maybe we're just out of firsts.,1,How I Met Your Mother,36,7
4713,Marshall,14, Looks like they're about to have theirs.,1,How I Met Your Mother,41,7
4714,Ted,14, Should we take this to the bedroom?,1,How I Met Your Mother,36,7
4715,Marshall,14, Yes!,1,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
4716,Lily,14, Yes!,1,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
4718,Marshall,14, Yes!,1,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
4719,Lily,14, Yes!,1,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
4721,Marshall,14," No. No, don't answer it!",1,How I Met Your Mother,25,5
4723,Marshall,14, You're answering it? He's answering it!,1,How I Met Your Mother,40,6
4724,Lily,14, No! Do her! Do her now!,1,How I Met Your Mother,24,6
4725,Ted,14, Sure. Good luck with that.  Sorry about that.,1,How I Met Your Mother,46,8
4727,Ted,14, I'll get another bottle.,1,How I Met Your Mother,25,4
4728,Lily,14, I need a drink. Do we have any cough syrup in here?,1,How I Met Your Mother,52,12
4729,Marshall,14, Shh...,1,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
4732,Robin,14," Oh, God. These brats have us completely surrounded. I counted nine, maybe ten. I'll lay down some cover fire, you make a run for it.",1,How I Met Your Mother,133,25
4733,Barney,14, No. Leave no man behind. Either we all get out of here or no one does.,1,How I Met Your Mother,71,16
4734,Robin,14, But I...,1,How I Met Your Mother,9,2
4735,Barney,14," Don't be a hero, Scherbotsky.",1,How I Met Your Mother,30,5
4736,Robin,14, See you on the other side.,1,How I Met Your Mother,27,6
4737,Barney,14, Damn. Want to go get a soft pretzel?,1,How I Met Your Mother,37,8
4738,Robin,14, Yeah.,1,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
4739,Barney,14, All right.,1,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
4741,Lily,14," Marshall, what happened to us? We used to just stare into each other's eyes all night long. Have we lost that?",1,How I Met Your Mother,111,21
4742,Marshall,14," Maybe. But I think I just found it. Right here. Baby, I'm giving you sexy smoldering with just a hint of crazy eyes.",1,How I Met Your Mother,117,23
4743,Lily,14," Okay, well, get ready for my sex-ray vision. Did you remember to pick up the dry cleaning? Oh, damn it.",1,How I Met Your Mother,104,20
4744,Marshall,14, It's all right. We can do this.,1,How I Met Your Mother,32,7
4745,Lily,14, Let's just hold hands. This is nice.,1,How I Met Your Mother,37,7
4746,Marshall,14, You love that move. It's a classic Marshall.,1,How I Met Your Mother,45,8
4747,Lily,14," All right, we totally suck at this. We really, really need to get out of here.",1,How I Met Your Mother,79,16
4748,Marshall,14," Well, we can't.",1,How I Met Your Mother,16,3
4749,Lily,14," Baby, there's something I have to do, and if I do it in front of you, it'll change the entire nature of our relationship.",1,How I Met Your Mother,122,24
4750,Marshall,14, What is it?,1,How I Met Your Mother,12,3
4751,Lily,14, I have to pee.,1,How I Met Your Mother,15,4
4752,Marshall,14, This is bad.,1,How I Met Your Mother,13,3
4753,Lily,14, Yeah.,1,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
4754,Marshall,14, We've gone nine years without peeing in front of each other. You always think there'll be more time.,1,How I Met Your Mother,101,18
4755,Lily,14," Look at us. We're basically an old married couple, and we're not even married yet. The flame of our romance is flickering, and if I pee all over it, it might go out forever.",1,How I Met Your Mother,174,34
4756,Marshall,14, How much longer do you think you can hold it?,1,How I Met Your Mother,46,10
4757,Lily,14, I drank a Big Gulp of Mountain Dew during that Quantum Leap marathon.,1,How I Met Your Mother,70,13
4758,Marshall,14," Oh, boy.",1,How I Met Your Mother,9,2
4760,Robin,14, Playing laser tag really takes me back. You know what game I really miss? Battleship. I've never lost a game.,1,How I Met Your Mother,110,20
4761,Barney,14, Neither have I. Of course I cheat.,1,How I Met Your Mother,35,7
4762,Robin,14," Oh, yeah, me, too. The trick is to bend the aircraft carrier so it makes an L.",1,How I Met Your Mother,79,17
4763,Barney,14, Ah. I always just stacked the ships on top of each other.,1,How I Met Your Mother,58,12
4764,Robin,14," Nice. You know, we should have a cheaters grudge match. I think I still have a... Hello. Target acquired. Hottie by the jukebox.",1,How I Met Your Mother,129,23
4765,Barney,14," Ooh, good eye, Scherbotsky. I got someone for you. Two o'clock, blue shirt.",1,How I Met Your Mother,76,13
4766,Robin,14, That's a woman.,1,How I Met Your Mother,16,3
4767,Barney,14," Oh, my mistake. Or is it?",1,How I Met Your Mother,26,6
4768,Robin,14, Let's just focus on your target.,1,How I Met Your Mother,33,6
4769,Barney,14, Right.,1,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
4770,Robin,14," Yeah, I got this one. Oh, my God. I love your jeans.",1,How I Met Your Mother,53,12
4772,Robin,14," Oh, no. I am all about the dudes. Although pickings are pretty slim tonight. Only hot guy here is blondie in the suit, and he's playing hard to get.",1,How I Met Your Mother,149,29
4774,Robin,14," Well, jeans will only get you so far. I'm going home with him.",1,How I Met Your Mother,63,13
4777,Lily,14," Oh, my God, I hate Ted. I hate him so much.",1,How I Met Your Mother,44,11
4778,Marshall,14," Baby, why don't you just go? Tons of other couples have peed in front of each other.",1,How I Met Your Mother,85,17
4779,Lily,14," No, but we haven't, because I want to keep some of the mystery alive.",1,How I Met Your Mother,70,14
4780,Marshall,14," Well, you have farted in front of me.",1,How I Met Your Mother,38,8
4781,Lily,14," Yes, but I always cover it with a cough.",1,How I Met Your Mother,41,9
4782,Marshall,14, You always do.,1,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
4784,Barney,14, Hey.,1,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
4785,Robin,14, Hey.,1,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
4786,Barney,14, Let's get out of here. Let's go somewhere else.,1,How I Met Your Mother,48,9
4787,Robin,14, What happened?,1,How I Met Your Mother,15,2
4788,Barney,14," Eh, you sometimes like to do a little catch and release.",1,How I Met Your Mother,57,11
4789,Robin,14, But why?,1,How I Met Your Mother,9,2
4790,Barney,14, Leave no man behind. Either we all score or no one scores.,1,How I Met Your Mother,59,12
4791,Robin,14," Right on. Hey, you want to go play Battleship?",1,How I Met Your Mother,47,9
4792,Barney,14, Hit!,1,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
4795,Ted,14, Should we move to the bedroom?,1,How I Met Your Mother,31,6
4797,Marshall,14," They can suck on each other's fingers for an hour, but there's no time to take two steps to the bedroom?",1,How I Met Your Mother,105,21
4798,Lily,14," Baby, I can't hold it in any longer. It's time.",1,How I Met Your Mother,48,10
4799,Marshall,14, I know.,1,How I Met Your Mother,8,2
4800,Lily,14," I love you, Marshall.",1,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
4801,Marshall,14," I love you, Lily.",1,How I Met Your Mother,18,4
4804,Barney,14," Well, you make a good bro. You're a better Ted than Ted. Hey, in fact, you have just earned yourself an invite to Marshall's bachelor party. And you don't even have to come out of the cake.",1,How I Met Your Mother,190,37
4805,Robin,14," Thanks. And, um, thanks for sticking around tonight. I hope you're ready for some hard-core Battleship. Come on, boys.",1,How I Met Your Mother,119,19
4806,Barney,14, Hard-core? That's the only way I play. ,1,How I Met Your Mother,40,7
4807,Robin,14, I found it. Are you ready to... What the hell are you doing?,1,How I Met Your Mother,61,13
4808,Barney,14," I'm birthday suiting up.vI'm sorry, did you want to undress me?",1,How I Met Your Mother,64,11
4809,Robin,14, No! I thought we were just hanging out as friends.,1,How I Met Your Mother,51,10
4810,Barney,14," Oh, come on, you have been throwing yourself at me all night.",1,How I Met Your Mother,62,12
4811,Robin,14, What?! I did the opposite! I threw some other girl at you.,1,How I Met Your Mother,59,12
4812,Barney,14," You invited me up to your apartment to ""play Battleship."" Is that not an internationally recognized term for s*x?",1,How I Met Your Mother,114,19
4813,Robin,14, No.,1,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
4814,Barney,14, Great. I hope you're happy. You sunk my battleship.,1,How I Met Your Mother,52,9
4816,Lily,14, I'm okay. You okay?,1,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
4817,Marshall,14," I feel the same. And yet, strangely different.",1,How I Met Your Mother,47,8
4818,Lily,14," I'm happy for my bladder, yet sad for us.",1,How I Met Your Mother,42,9
4819,Marshall,14," You had to do it, sweetie... for Ted. And, hey, look, at least now we can stay in here as long as it takes.",1,How I Met Your Mother,108,24
4820,Lily,14," Yeah. I guess our relationship had to take a hit so a new one out there could blossom. Oh, crap!",1,How I Met Your Mother,97,20
4821,Marshall,14, They must have heard that.,1,How I Met Your Mother,27,5
4822,Lily,14," Well, I guess we can come out now. I don't believe it. They're gone.",1,How I Met Your Mother,69,14
4823,Marshall,14, Good. 'Cause I got to take a whiz.,1,How I Met Your Mother,35,8
4825,Robin,14," Okay, you and me, that's insane. If you even thought about it for one second...",1,How I Met Your Mother,80,15
4826,Barney,14," But I have thought about it for three seconds, and it makes a lot of sense. We both think the marriage commitment thing's a drag. We both want something casual and fun. And we clearly get along really well.",1,How I Met Your Mother,207,39
4827,Robin,14," Wow, that actually did make a lot of sense. But what about Ted?",1,How I Met Your Mother,64,13
4828,Barney,14, I checked with Ted.,1,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
4830,Barney,14," Ted, so now that things with you and Victoria are going pretty well, I assume you're over all the girls you were into before, right? I take your silence as a yes, so say I were to hook up with someone, say Robin, you'd be cool with that, right?",1,How I Met Your Mother,245,49
4831,Ted,14, Sure. Good luck with that.,1,How I Met Your Mother,27,5
4833,Barney,14, Totally gave us his blessing.,1,How I Met Your Mother,30,5
4834,Robin,14, Really?,1,How I Met Your Mother,8,1
4835,Barney,14, Really.,1,How I Met Your Mother,8,1
4836,Robin,14, So Ted didn't care that you wanted to make a move on me?,1,How I Met Your Mother,57,13
4837,Barney,14, Didn't care at all. Oh. Oh...,1,How I Met Your Mother,30,6
4838,Robin,14, What?,1,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
4839,Barney,14, You like Ted.,1,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
4840,Robin,14, I didn't say I liked Ted.,1,How I Met Your Mother,26,6
4841,Barney,14, You like Ted. Wow. This is huge.,1,How I Met Your Mother,33,7
4842,Robin,14," Barney, I don't like Ted. He's moved on, and I'm really happy for...",1,How I Met Your Mother,69,13
4843,Barney,14," Yeah, yeah. Look, are we gonna play Battleship or what?",1,How I Met Your Mother,56,10
4844,Robin,14," You're not gonna tell him, are you?",1,How I Met Your Mother,36,7
4845,Barney,14, No. That's the bro code. A bro doesn't tell a mutual bro that a third bro has a crush on him. Just like the third bro doesn't tell the mutual bro that the original bro went bare pickle in front of her. It's quid pro bro.,1,How I Met Your Mother,221,46
4846,Robin,14, A-7.,1,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
4847,Barney,14, Miss.,1,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
4848,Robin,14, Of course.,1,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
4850,Marshall,14," Well, we still have one frontier left. Still got the deuce.",1,How I Met Your Mother,60,11
4851,Lily,14, Not making me feel better.,1,How I Met Your Mother,27,5
4852,Marshall,14," Well, it certainly was a first.",1,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
4853,Lily,14," It was, wasn't it? We still have firsts.",1,How I Met Your Mother,41,8
4854,Marshall,14," Of course we do. And you know what, I actually feel closer to you now. I want to know you. Like, know your soul.",1,How I Met Your Mother,113,24
4855,Lily,14," Marshall, what makes you cry?",1,How I Met Your Mother,30,5
4856,Marshall,14, This moment is fleeting because it's being chased by another moment.,1,How I Met Your Mother,69,11
4857,Lily,14," Oh, just grab my boob already.",1,How I Met Your Mother,31,6
4859,Ted,14," Come on, guys, get a room.",1,How I Met Your Mother,27,6
4861,Ted,15," You don't have to shout out ""poker"" when you win.",1,How I Met Your Mother,50,10
4862,Marshall,15, I know. It's just fun to say.,1,How I Met Your Mother,30,7
4865,Marshall,15," It's called ""Marsh-gammon."" It combines all the best features of all the best games... Candy Land, I Never, Pictionary.",1,How I Met Your Mother,120,19
4866,Robin,15," Backgammon, obviously.",1,How I Met Your Mother,23,2
4867,Marshall,15," No. Backgammon sucks. I took the only good part of backgammon, the ""gammon,"" and I left the rest of it in the trash where it belongs.",1,How I Met Your Mother,134,26
4868,Lily,15, I'm so excited Victoria's coming.,1,How I Met Your Mother,34,5
4869,Robin,15, I'm going to go get another round.,1,How I Met Your Mother,35,7
4870,Ted,15," Okay, I want to lay down some ground rules for tonight. Barney, I actually like Victoria... a lot, so don't say anything embarrass... Don't say anything. And guys, I haven't exactly told Victoria that I used to have a kind of thing for Robin, so we you could just avoid the...",1,How I Met Your Mother,277,51
4871,Barney,15," Well, well, well. How rich. You make me promise to be on my best behavior around your girlfriend, yet, you have been lying to her since day one. Excuse me.Hi. Leg Warehouse? Yeah, my friend Ted needs something to stand on. So, nothing for him to stand on? Okay, and thanks so much. Ted, doesn't Victoria deserve to know that you once had the hots for Robin? I have half a mind to tell the story of the re-return.",1,How I Met Your Mother,413,79
4872,Ted,15, No. I-I swore you to secrecy on that.,1,How I Met Your Mother,38,8
4873,Lily,15," Ooh, I am smelling dirt. What is the story of the re-return?",1,How I Met Your Mother,61,12
4874,Ted,15," Nothing. It's nothing. And speaking of digging up dirt, can I count on you two to behave around Victoria?",1,How I Met Your Mother,106,19
4875,Lily,15, Us? What would we do?,1,How I Met Your Mother,22,5
4876,Ted,15," Look, um, you guys have always been like the parents that I still have and, in fact, moved here to get away from. However, could we skip the traditional interrogation of the new girlfriend tonight?",1,How I Met Your Mother,198,35
4877,Marshall,15, Fine.,1,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
4878,Lily,15, Fine.,1,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
4879,Ted,15, Thank you.,1,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
4880,Lily,15, I should go help Robin.,1,How I Met Your Mother,24,5
4881,Robin,15, Hey.,1,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
4882,Lily,15," Hey. So, are you going to be okay hanging out with Victoria tonight?",1,How I Met Your Mother,69,13
4883,Robin,15," Oh, sure. She's great. Oh, what? Because of the whole thing where I said I liked Ted? No. Victoria's great. She's fun, she's free-spirited, she's great. I said, ""She's great"" too many times, didn't I?",1,How I Met Your Mother,201,35
4884,Lily,15, You must really hate the bitch.,1,How I Met Your Mother,32,6

5040,Ted,15," You're right. Victoria, I'm sorry I haven't told you this yet, but a while back, I was kind of into Robin. In fact, on our first date, I might have said, ""I love you."" Understandably, she freaked out and I left. But unfortunately, the night did not end there.",1,How I Met Your Mother,260,49
5042,Ted,15, We all ended up at the bar with our cab driver Ranjit.,1,How I Met Your Mother,55,12

5064,Barney,15," Hi, Shannon.",1,How I Met Your Mother,13,2
5066,Barney,15," Just listen. When you left me for that guy Greg, it changed me. Now I'm this. I-I know this is crazy. It's just, you were once such a big part of my life. And it just seemed insane that you didn't know who I am now. So here I am. And then she told me about her life.",1,How I Met Your Mother,267,58
5068,Barney,15, She and Greg dated for a while and then split up. But here's the real kicker,1,How I Met Your Mother,77,16

5070,Barney,15," My life rocks! Money, suits and s*x. These are tears of joy! I could be cooped up in some tiny apartment changing some brat's poopy diapers. But instead, I'm out in the world being awesome 24-7, 365! You let me dodge a bullet, Big Guy. Plus, here's the mini-cherry on top of the regular cherry on top of the sundae of awesomeness that is my life. After Shannon and I talked, I nailed her.",1,How I Met Your Mother,389,74

5077,Barney,15," Video's pretty good on this phone, huh?",1,How I Met Your Mother,40,7
5079,Barney,15," Oh, no. It just takes a while to power down.",1,How I Met Your Mother,45,10
5080,Lily,15," Ew, gross. Just stop it.",1,How I Met Your Mother,25,5
5081,Barney,15," Ladies, gentlemen... Ted. This has been a wonderful evening. I got great dirt on all you guys. I got Ted to tell the re-return. I finally nailed Shannon!

5093,Barney,16, So wear another one.,1,How I Met Your Mother,21,4
5094,Marshall,16, I don't have another one. I'm flat broke. My only other suit options are track or birthday.,1,How I Met Your Mother,92,17
5095,Barney,16," Dude, you show up to an interview in that, even the hippie lawyers from Granola Mountain Earth Pals will hackey sack you straight out the door.",1,How I Met Your Mother,144,26
5096,Marshall,16," Okay, it's the National Resource Defense Council, and it's my dream job. Except it's only an internship, and I won't be getting paid. Mostly getting people coffee. But the people I'm getting coffee for... their bosses are going to save the world.",1,How I Met Your Mother,247,42
5097,Barney,16," Okay, tomorrow... oh, and I should mention this is going to rock your world-- tomorrow I'm taking you to my personal tailor.",1,How I Met Your Mother,125,22

5115,Lily,16," Robin, you've got to get over this Ted and Victoria thing. You had your chance, and now he's moved on. Can't you just be happy for them?",1,How I Met Your Mother,137,27

5128,Ted,16," Mm-hmm. And if you do, what does that mean for us?",1,How I Met Your Mother,51,11
5130,Ted,16," Oh, God, no. Long-distance is a lie teenagers tell each other to get laid the summer before college.",1,How I Met Your Mother,101,18
5132,Ted,16," Either you stay here, or we break up. Wow. Um, look, let's just see how things progress, and if by September, we still feel...",1,How I Met Your Mother,127,24

5140,Marshall,16," Hey, baby, how's the dress place?",1,How I Met Your Mother,34,6
5141,Lily,16, Everything's so fluffy and white. It's like shopping in a marshmallow. How's Barney's tailor?,1,How I Met Your Mother,94,14
5142,Marshall,16," Um, everything here is dark and sketchy and seems illegal. It's like shopping in Barney's mind.",1,How I Met Your Mother,96,16
5143,Lily,16," Well, good luck, baby.",1,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
5144,Marshall,16," Bye. Hey, Barney, I'm not sure about this. A tailor in the back room of a pet store?",1,How I Met Your Mother,85,18

5146,Marshall,16, You speak Ukrainian?,1,How I Met Your Mother,21,3
5147,Ted,16," Guys, I'm kind of screwed here. I don't want to lose Victoria, but I can't ask her to stay just for me. And long distance definitely isn't an option.",1,How I Met Your Mother,150,29

5150,Ted,16, Really? You?,1,How I Met Your Mother,13,2
5151,Barney,16," Absolutely. I'm juggling four right now. There's Lisa in Madrid, there's Erica in Tokyo, there's Laura in Denmark, and Kelly on 34th Street. The lass thinks I'm a humble sheep shearer from Killarney.",1,How I Met Your Mother,200,33
5152,Marshall,16," Ted, do you remember in college when Lily did that summer art program in Paris?",1,How I Met Your Mother,80,15
5153,Ted,16, Yeah.,1,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
5154,Marshall,16," Well, she kept talking about this cheesy French guy, Gabriel. So, I went out to visit, and there was this party. And who shows up but Gabriel. And he's got this weak-ass, thin French moustache. I'm not much of a fighter, but I knew I could take this weird little dude. So, I took him aside, and I got all creepy quiet, I got the crazy eyes going, and I said, ""You stay away from Lily, or I swear to God I'll eat that moustache right off of your ugly French face."" Yeah. Yeah, he literally ran away. I think he was crying. I never told Lily about it. To be honest, I'm not very proud of it. To be even more honest, I am.",1,How I Met Your Mother,620,125
5155,Ted,16," Um, other than confirming a lot of European stereotypes about Americans, did that little story have a point?",1,How I Met Your Mother,109,18
5156,Marshall,16," Yeah, the point is that even though Lily is my soul mate, long distance still almost killed us. If you think that there's any chance that Victoria is your soul mate, you should ask her to stay.",1,How I Met Your Mother,194,37
5157,Ted,16," Well, I don't know if she is. It's still so early, but yeah, she could be.",1,How I Met Your Mother,75,16
5158,Marshall,16," Oh, please. You barely know this girl. What's her favorite color? Is she a cat person or a dog person? Is she open to a three-way? Ted, I do more research than this before buying a cell phone. FYI, yes, I have three-way calling.",1,How I Met Your Mother,229,44
5159,Ted,16," Look, she can't be a cat person. I'm a dog person, I'm attracted to other dog people.",1,How I Met Your Mother,86,17
5160,Barney,16, Are you sure?,1,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
5161,Ted,16, All right. ,1,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
5163,Ted,16," Hey, random question. How do you feel about cats?",1,How I Met Your Mother,50,9
5165,Ted,16," Good to know. Um, okay. Good-bye.  She's a cat person. I don't know this girl at all.",1,How I Met Your Mother,86,17
5166,Barney,16," Oh, excellent. We'll take this one.",1,How I Met Your Mother,36,6
5167,Marshall,16," Whoa. Hey, hey, it's my suit. Shouldn't I be the one to choose?",1,How I Met Your Mother,64,13
5168,Barney,16, Here. Play with this pin cushion.,1,How I Met Your Mother,34,6
5169,Marshall,16, God. I'm going to look hot.,1,How I Met Your Mother,28,6
5170,Barney,16," Marshall, I can't let you waste a suit this nice fighting a losing battle for our planet's survival. This is a suit for winners. I am getting you an interview at my office. We need good men like you in our legal department. We get sued a lot.",1,How I Met Your Mother,243,48
5171,Marshall,16, No way. The Kid does not sell out.,1,How I Met Your Mother,35,8
5172,Barney,16," Oh, come on, dude! Three months working with me, you'll make more than Lily makes in a year.",1,How I Met Your Mother,93,18
5173,Marshall,16, No. I've made my decision.,1,How I Met Your Mother,27,5
5174,Ted,16," So have I. If I ask this girl to give up her dreams for me, and two weeks later, it's not working out, I'm, like, the biggest jerk of all time. It's just too much pressure on a new relationship. I'm going to tell her to go.",1,How I Met Your Mother,224,47
5178,Ted,16, I want you to stay.,1,How I Met Your Mother,20,5
5180,Marshall,16, Everything here is dark and sketchy and seems illegal. It's like shopping in Barney's mind.,1,How I Met Your Mother,92,15
5181,Lily,16," Oh, good luck, baby.",1,How I Met Your Mother,21,4
5182,Marshall,16, Bye.,1,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
5184,Lily,16, Nothing too huge or-or poofy. I'm not really a girlie girl. But I would like to look like a beautiful princess.,1,How I Met Your Mother,112,21
5185,Robin,16, I saw a couple up front that were nice.,1,How I Met Your Mother,40,9
5187,Lily,16, Where does she get off? She doesn't know how much money I make.,1,How I Met Your Mother,64,13
5189,Lily,16, Damn you Old Navy and your reasonably-priced three-packs!,1,How I Met Your Mother,58,8
5191,Robin,16, And cake.,1,How I Met Your Mother,10,2
5193,Robin,16," Speaking of which, Victoria, have you decided what to do about your doughnut fellowship?",1,How I Met Your Mother,89,14
5195,Lily,16, Ugh. All talking and no s*x. Kill me now.,1,How I Met Your Mother,42,9
5197,Robin,16," Well, I don't know. I'd feel a little Stepford turning down a huge opportunity to chase some guy I'd only known two months.",1,How I Met Your Mother,124,23
5199,Robin,16," Yeah, in America, but German guys? Whew! I would let them bread my schnitzel any day, if you know what I mean.",1,How I Met Your Mother,111,22
5201,Robin,16," s*x. Oh, excuse me, ma'am. This b*st*rd's kicked.",1,How I Met Your Mother,50,8
5204,Lily,16," It's okay, guys, I hate it.",1,How I Met Your Mother,28,6
5206,Robin,16," It's bad, it's really bad. Short in front, long in the back? That is the mullet of wedding dresses.",1,How I Met Your Mother,100,19
5207,Lily,16," You know, Victoria, Marshall and I did long distance once. In college, I did an art course in Paris. I was the only American there. It was really lonely. I only had one friend, Gabrielle. She was kind of homely and strange-looking, and she was really self-conscious about this little moustache she had. Anyway, halfway through the semester, she just stopped talking to me, and I never figured out why. And then I had nobody. The only thing that got me through was knowing that my soul mate was back at home waiting for me. If Ted's your soul mate, then it may be worth it to hang onto him.",1,How I Met Your Mother,590,110
5209,Ted,16," Hey, random question",1,How I Met Your Mother,21,3
5211,Robin,16, A cat person. Why am I not surprised?,1,How I Met Your Mother,38,8
5213,Lily,16, Maybe he's going to buy you one.,1,How I Met Your Mother,33,7
5215,Robin,16, Maybe he's using an adorable kitty to guilt you into staying.,1,How I Met Your Mother,62,11
5217,Robin,16," Oh, I wouldn't even wait to find out. I would be on the next plane to Germany.",1,How I Met Your Mother,79,17
5219,Lily,16," Oh, God, you guys are sucky liars.",1,How I Met Your Mother,35,7
5220,Robin,16," Ugly, ugly, ugly.",1,How I Met Your Mother,18,3
5222,Lily,16, Are you okay?,1,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
5223,Robin,16, I'm fine.,1,How I Met Your Mother,10,2
5224,Lily,16, Okay. Just kind of seemed like you're trying to hustle Victoria out of the country.,1,How I Met Your Mother,84,15
5225,Robin,16," I'm not, I'm just trying to support her. She got a super-important dessert scholarship.",1,How I Met Your Mother,88,14
5226,Lily,16," Stop being sarcastic. It is a super-important dessert scholarship. Wow, that's hard to say without sounding sarcastic. Look... I know you're not Victoria's biggest fan, but she seems to make Ted happy. So think about that before you use your miles to buy her a plane ticket.",1,How I Met Your Mother,275,47
5228,Lily,16," Oh, my gosh, it's perfect! Oh! This dress is totally going to get me laid on my wedding night.",1,How I Met Your Mother,95,19
5230,Robin,16, I know what you mean.,1,How I Met Your Mother,22,5
5232,Lily,16," Well, I'm always putting my career ahead of my relationships, and... to be honest, there's a lot of lonely nights in that job description.",1,How I Met Your Mother,139,24
5234,Robin,16, Choosing Ted over your career doesn't make you un-feminist. Maybe it just means that you guys would be happy together.,1,How I Met Your Mother,119,20
5236,Robin,16," Oh, no way... you're the coolest.",1,How I Met Your Mother,34,6
5238,Robin,16," Okay, I am.",1,How I Met Your Mother,12,3
5241,Lily,16," Oh, I am so beautiful! Oh, don't tell me how much it costs. Just snap my neck now, so I can die this pretty.",1,How I Met Your Mother,109,24
5242,Robin,16," Wow, you look incredible.",1,How I Met Your Mother,26,4
5243,Lily,16," Oh. Okay, okay, how much is it, on a scale of never to never ever?",1,How I Met Your Mother,67,15
5244,Robin,16," Never ever, ever, ever, ever... times infinity.",1,How I Met Your Mother,48,7
5245,Lily,16," Well, it's okay. You know, what makes a bride beautiful is that she's just happy to be getting married.  Oh, guys, I know I look amazing, but the important thing is that Marshall and I love each other, right?",1,How I Met Your Mother,209,39
5246,Robin,16," Yes, you're right. But also... you just sat down in the cake.",1,How I Met Your Mother,62,12
5248,Robin,16," Okay. Come on, get up, let us see how bad it is.",1,How I Met Your Mother,49,12
5250,Lily,16, It was like this when I found it?,1,How I Met Your Mother,34,8
5252,Lily,16, Credit card... s.,1,How I Met Your Mother,18,3
5255,Ted,16, I want you to stay.,1,How I Met Your Mother,20,5
5257,Ted,16, You're going?,1,How I Met Your Mother,14,2
5259,Ted,16, So that's what you decided?,1,How I Met Your Mother,28,5
5261,Ted,16," What is this, opposite day or something?",1,How I Met Your Mother,41,7
5263,Ted,16, So it is?,1,How I Met Your Mother,10,3
5265,Ted,16," I was totally going to tell you to go, but then you gave me this cupcake, and it reminded me how great you are.",1,How I Met Your Mother,112,24
5267,Ted,16," Well, that's just crazy.",1,How I Met Your Mother,25,4
5269,Ted,16, But you have a job here and a life; I'd have nothing there.,1,How I Met Your Mother,60,13
5271,Ted,16," We've only been dating two months. Oh, it's not fair. It's not fair that we have to break up. I hate this.",1,How I Met Your Mother,107,22
5273,Ted,16, I guess so. I guess so.,1,How I Met Your Mother,24,6
5276,Marshall,16," God, that sucks, man. I'm so sorry.",1,How I Met Your Mother,36,7
5277,Ted,16," It was just too much pressure too soon. I mean, maybe it was silly to even think... Yes, Marshall, I see your new suit, and it's awesome.",1,How I Met Your Mother,138,27
5278,Marshall,16," Well, thank you for acknowledging it. It was weird that you hadn't. Look, I understand that you guys had to break up eventually, but why today?",1,How I Met Your Mother,144,26
5279,Ted,16, She's leaving tomorrow.,1,How I Met Your Mother,24,3
5280,Marshall,16," Yeah, but she's still in town.",1,How I Met Your Mother,31,6
5281,Ted,16," Yeah, she... she's still in town.",1,How I Met Your Mother,34,6
5282,Marshall,16," Yeah, so you spend one more amazing day together. Ted, think about it this way",1,How I Met Your Mother,79,15
5283,Ted,16," Awesome air kicks, huh?",1,How I Met Your Mother,24,4
5284,Marshall,16, New pajama bottoms?,1,How I Met Your Mother,20,3
5285,Ted,16, You know it.,1,How I Met Your Mother,13,3
5287,Ted,16," So we can sit around and cry, or we can run, and do awesome air kicks before our leg gets chopped off.",1,How I Met Your Mother,103,22
5289,Ted,16," No, the leg is a metaphor.",1,How I Met Your Mother,27,6
5291,Ted,16," Come on, we've had a good run. Why end on a fight?",1,How I Met Your Mother,51,12
5293,Ted,16, Let's do all the stuff we talked about doing and never got around to.,1,How I Met Your Mother,70,14
5295,Ted,16," Yeah, we'll walk across the Brooklyn Bridge.",1,How I Met Your Mother,45,7
5297,Ted,16, Go to that French-Vietnamese place we keep passing and say we want to try?,1,How I Met Your Mother,75,14
5299,Ted,16," Yeah, big day.",1,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
5303,Robin,16," Lily, you have to tell him. That dress cost a fortune.",1,How I Met Your Mother,55,11
5304,Lily,16," No, I'm just gonna wait for the next time Marshall really screws up, and then, I'll just slip this in, and it won't seem so bad by comparison.",1,How I Met Your Mother,143,28
5305,Robin,16," Well, here's hoping he cheats on you.",1,How I Met Your Mother,38,7
5306,Lily,16," Yeah, but only, like, second base.",1,How I Met Your Mother,35,6
5307,Barney,16, Look at us,1,How I Met Your Mother,11,3
5308,Marshall,16," Hey, babe. Dollar beer night, so I splurged and got us each our own.",1,How I Met Your Mother,69,14
5309,Barney,16," So, have you thought more about coming to work for Barney Corp?",1,How I Met Your Mother,64,12
5310,Marshall,16," Oh, please... your company is not called Barney Corp.",1,How I Met Your Mother,54,9
5311,Barney,16," Yet. Oh, I almost forgot. Sergei sent me your bill.",1,How I Met Your Mother,52,10
5312,Marshall,16," B... Barney, this says $4,000. I thought you said that it was one-third price.",1,How I Met Your Mother,79,14
5313,Barney,16," Yeah, must be a $12,000 suit. Oh, well, guess you'll have to come work at my company.",1,How I Met Your Mother,86,17
5314,Marshall,16, You set this up! You set this whole thing up!,1,How I Met Your Mother,46,10
5315,Barney,16, I most certainly did...,1,How I Met Your Mother,24,4
5316,Marshall,16," Well, it won't work. Even if I have to get two extra night jobs, I'll pay your precious tailor. I'm not selling my soul. Baby, I know that this will make things harder, but I will make it work, I promise.",1,How I Met Your Mother,205,41
5317,Lily,16," I destroyed an $8,000 wedding dress.",1,How I Met Your Mother,37,6
5318,Marshall,16, What time is the interview?,1,How I Met Your Mother,28,5
5319,Barney,16,9,1,How I Met Your Mother,2,1
5322,Ted,16," Yeah, I was almost too tired for all the s*x.",1,How I Met Your Mother,46,10
5324,Ted,16," I'm going to miss you, too.",1,How I Met Your Mother,28,6
5326,Ted,16, Even if we're not.,1,How I Met Your Mother,19,4
5328,Ted,16," Look, I know it never works for anyone, but... do you want to try long distance?",1,How I Met Your Mother,81,16
5330,Ted,16, We can beat the odds.,1,How I Met Your Mother,22,5
5332,Ted,16, It's gonna work. We're going to make it work-- it'll work.,1,How I Met Your Mother,59,11
5336,Marshall,17, What advice do you have for a budding anthropologist?,1,How I Met Your Mother,54,9
5338,Marshall,17," Yep. When I grow up, I want to go live with the gorillas, just like you did.",1,How I Met Your Mother,77,17
5342,Marshall,17,"...and if economic sanctions and trade restrictions aren't enforced, the destruction of the rainforests will continue and over a million species will be wiped out.",1,How I Met Your Mother,163,25
5343,Ted,17, So you don't want coffee.,1,How I Met Your Mother,26,5
5344,Marshall,17, I'm saying that the coffee industry is causing irreversible...,1,How I Met Your Mother,63,9
5345,Ted,17, All right. I'm pouring it out.,1,How I Met Your Mother,31,6
5346,Marshall,17," Okay, one cup. The kid needs to be alert. First day on the job and everything.",1,How I Met Your Mother,79,16
5347,Ted,17," I still can't believe you're going all corporate on us. ""The kid"" has become ""the man.""",1,How I Met Your Mother,88,16
5348,Marshall,17," Okay, it's just an internship to make a little money. After law school, I'm going to work for the NRDC. They're gonna stop global warming.",1,How I Met Your Mother,139,25
5350,Lily,17, Here's your sack lunch.,1,How I Met Your Mother,24,4
5351,Marshall,17," Okay, I love you because, one, you made me a sack lunch and two, you laugh every time you say the word ""sack"".",1,How I Met Your Mother,111,23

5361,Ted,17, Three.,1,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
5362,Lily,17, And how many have you sent her?,1,How I Met Your Mother,32,7
5363,Ted,17," In the mail or in my mind? Zero. She's up three-zip. Oh! Cupcakes! Great. I bet they're delicious, too. Yup, they're delicious. Damn it! I don't deserve these delicious cupcakes. God, I hate myself right now.",1,How I Met Your Mother,209,36
5364,Marshall,17," God, that is so me at 15.",1,How I Met Your Mother,26,7
5368,Barney,17, Go for Barney.,1,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
5370,Barney,17, A sasquatch?,1,How I Met Your Mother,13,2
5372,Barney,17, Yes! Look at you. You suited in an unmistakably upward direction.,1,How I Met Your Mother,66,11

5374,Barney,17," Yeah, hell, yeah. I got 'em all",1,How I Met Your Mother,32,7

5385,Marshall,17," Where, I don't, I don't see...",1,How I Met Your Mother,31,6
5386,Barney,17, Marshall? Sidebar. Your tie is steak sauce. It means A-1. A-1? Get it? Try to keep up.,1,How I Met Your Mother,87,17
5388,Marshall,17, I don't have a back door.,1,How I Met Your Mother,26,6
5390,Marshall,17," Right. Well, uh... I'm engaged, so--",1,How I Met Your Mother,37,6
5392,Marshall,17," We're still engaged, even if she's...",1,How I Met Your Mother,38,6
5395,Ted,17, Sure you don't want one?,1,How I Met Your Mother,25,5
5396,Robin,17, How many of those have you eaten?,1,How I Met Your Mother,34,7
5397,Ted,17," Four. Teen. No, just four. And the icing from two more. So, anyway, here's the problem.",1,How I Met Your Mother,88,16
5399,Ted,17," Hey, it's Ted. I guess you're asleep. Anyway, I got the care package, and it's just great. Here, listen... Mmm. Mmm!",1,How I Met Your Mother,117,21
5401,Ted,17," So I'm standing there, my mouth full of this delicious relationship-winning cupcake... And... I said something dumb.",1,How I Met Your Mother,117,17
5403,Ted,17," Oh, and, um... don't worry, yours is in the mail. I sent it a couple days ago. And it's awesome. Really, really awesome.",1,How I Met Your Mother,121,23
5405,Ted,17, Why did I say that? I think frosting makes me lie.,1,How I Met Your Mother,51,11
5406,Robin,17," Oh, Teddy boy.",1,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
5407,Ted,17," Yeah. So now, whatever I send her, she'll know I sent it after I talked to her. So that's the problem. You work on that. I'm gonna eat this cupcake.",1,How I Met Your Mother,149,30
5408,Robin,17," All right, here's what you do",1,How I Met Your Mother,30,6

5414,Robin,17," Okay, fine, I have feelings for him.",1,How I Met Your Mother,37,7

5417,Robin,17," The irony is clear, Ted.",1,How I Met Your Mother,25,5
5419,Lily,17, Hey! How was your first day?,1,How I Met Your Mother,29,6
5420,Marshall,17, I don't wanna talk about it. The guys I work with are a bunch of jerks.,1,How I Met Your Mother,72,16
5421,Lily,17, What?,1,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
5422,Marshall,17, They're jerks!,1,How I Met Your Mother,15,2

5424,Marshall,17," Forget it, I don't want to talk about it. Well, like today at lunch..",1,How I Met Your Mother,70,14
5427,Marshall,17," For your information, my fiancee did.",1,How I Met Your Mother,38,6
5429,Marshall,17, No.,1,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
5431,Marshall,17, Nothing. Give it.,1,How I Met Your Mother,18,3
5433,Marshall,17, Give it.,1,How I Met Your Mother,9,2
5435,Marshall,17," Give it back. Hey, give it. Gimme... Give it!",1,How I Met Your Mother,46,9
5437,Lily,17," Oh, screw those guys! We're adorable.",1,How I Met Your Mother,38,6
5438,Marshall,17," I know. God. It's like freshman year all over again. Only this time, my sweet dance moves aren't going to be enough to win them over. Not even Old Reliable.",1,How I Met Your Mother,157,30
5439,Lily,17," Sweetie... It would be cool to have some extra money, but, but, if you're unhappy, it's not worth it.",1,How I Met Your Mother,102,19
5441,Marshall,17, I quit.,1,How I Met Your Mother,8,2
5442,Barney,17," What? No. We're having so much fun. You, me, working together. It's great.",1,How I Met Your Mother,75,13
5443,Marshall,17," We're not even working together, Barney. I'm in the legal department and you're... Seriously, what is it that you do?",1,How I Met Your Mother,118,20
5444,Barney,17, Please.,1,How I Met Your Mother,8,1
5445,Marshall,17," I'm sorry, dude, this corporate thing, it's just... it's not for me.",1,How I Met Your Mother,69,12
5446,Barney,17," Oh, of course it's not for you. It's for Lily.",1,How I Met Your Mother,47,10
5447,Marshall,17, What?,1,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
5448,Barney,17, Marshall. Lily's a catch. But do you really think you're going to hang onto a girl that great without the package?,1,How I Met Your Mother,115,21
5449,Marshall,17, The package?,1,How I Met Your Mother,13,2
5450,Barney,17, The package. The house. The car. Sending your kids to a great school. A vacation once in a while.,1,How I Met Your Mother,98,19
5451,Marshall,17, Lily doesn't care about that stuff.,1,How I Met Your Mother,36,6
5452,Barney,17," Well, no-- now she doesn't, but how's she going to feel in a couple years, when she's supporting you on a kindergarten teacher's salary while you're off in court defending some... endangered... South American... flying beaver.",1,How I Met Your Mother,227,36
5453,Marshall,17, She'll be happy.,1,How I Met Your Mother,17,3
5454,Barney,17, Okay. But will you be happy knowing you could have made her a lot happier.,1,How I Met Your Mother,75,15
5457,Marshall,17," I guess, uh... Bea Arthur.",1,How I Met Your Mother,27,5
5460,Robin,17," So, did she get the awesome care package yet?",1,How I Met Your Mother,46,9
5461,Ted,17, Yep. Yesterday.,1,How I Met Your Mother,16,2
5462,Robin,17, Did she love it?,1,How I Met Your Mother,17,4
5463,Ted,17," Ooh, she loved it.",1,How I Met Your Mother,19,4
5464,Robin,17, So what's the problem?,1,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
5465,Ted,17," So I was talking to her last night. And, I should tell you, we've been talking on the phone every other night for, like, an hour and a half. Eventually you just run out of stuff to say.",1,How I Met Your Mother,186,38
5467,Ted,17, What did you have for lunch today? Oh. Rye bread. Yeah.,1,How I Met Your Mother,56,11
5469,Robin,17," Oh, Teddy boy.",1,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
5470,Ted,17," I'm usually so good at being a boyfriend, but this never-seeing-each-other thing, it's a bitch. Maybe it just can't be do. I think it's clear what I have to do.",1,How I Met Your Mother,161,30
5471,Robin,17, It's pretty clear.,1,How I Met Your Mother,19,3
5472,Ted,17, I have to go to Germany and surprise her.,1,How I Met Your Mother,42,9
5473,Robin,17," Totally what I was thinking. Get out of my head, man!",1,How I Met Your Mother,54,11
5475,Marshall,17," Barney, how do I get these idiots to leave me alone?",1,How I Met Your Mother,53,11
5476,Barney,17," Marshall, consider the penguins.",1,How I Met Your Mother,33,4
5477,Marshall,17, The penguins?,1,How I Met Your Mother,14,2
5478,Barney,17, On the wall.,1,How I Met Your Mother,13,3
5479,Marshall,17," ""Conformity. It's the one who's different that gets left out in the cold."" This is a motivational poster?",1,How I Met Your Mother,106,18
5480,Barney,17," Look at yourself, Marshall. You're not happy. And you know why? Because you're different. Now, I suppose you could learn to love yourself for the unique little snowflake that you are, or... you could change your entire personality, which is just so much easier.",1,How I Met Your Mother,262,44
5483,Lily,17," Change your personality? That is so awful, and not at all motivational.",1,How I Met Your Mother,72,12
5484,Marshall,17," Not necessarily. Okay, at first, I was appalled, but then I realized it's just like Dr. Aurelia Birnholz-Vasquez in Life Among the Gorillas. I have to gain the acceptance of the herd by behaving exactly like one of them. It's an anthropological study. Isn't that cool?",1,How I Met Your Mother,269,46
5485,Lily,17, It sounds kinda like peer pressure.,1,How I Met Your Mother,36,6
5486,Marshall,17," No, no, no. It's totally anthropological and it's cool and I'm doing it.",1,How I Met Your Mother,73,13
5487,Lily,17," Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's peer pressure. We have an assembly every year.",1,How I Met Your Mother,74,13
5488,Marshall,17, I'm portraying someone who succumbs to peer pressure.,1,How I Met Your Mother,54,8
5489,Lily,17," All right, but if those guys try to pressure you to smoke, what do you say?",1,How I Met Your Mother,76,16
5490,Marshall,17, Only when I'm drunk.,1,How I Met Your Mother,21,4
5491,Lily,17, Good boy.,1,How I Met Your Mother,10,2
5494,Barney,17," Okay, I'm psyched about this. But if I'm going to mentor you, I need to know you're psyched about this, too.",1,How I Met Your Mother,109,21
5495,Marshall,17," Oh, I am. I'm, I'm psyched.",1,How I Met Your Mother,28,6
5496,Barney,17," Yeah, but it's one thing to say it, it's another thing to show it. Show it.",1,How I Met Your Mother,76,16
5497,Marshall,17, I'm psyched!,1,How I Met Your Mother,13,2
5498,Barney,17," What was that? Marshall, I should feel tremors of psychitude rock my body like a seizure. That was like a declawed pregnant cat on a porch swing idly swatting at a fly on a lazy Sunday afternoon.",1,How I Met Your Mother,196,37
5499,Marshall,17," Wow, that was really specific.",1,How I Met Your Mother,31,5
5500,Barney,17, Show me you're psyched! Let's do this! Ow! That hurt!,1,How I Met Your Mother,54,10
5501,Marshall,17, So badly.,1,How I Met Your Mother,10,2
5502,Barney,17, And then you slip it to the guy with a discreet handshake and he'll get it done.,1,How I Met Your Mother,81,17
5503,Marshall,17, Right. Get what done?,1,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
5504,Barney,17, Whatever.,1,How I Met Your Mother,10,1
5505,Marshall,17, Cool. And what guy is this?,1,How I Met Your Mother,28,6
5506,Barney,17, There's always a guy.,1,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
5507,Marshall,17," Okay, all right, I, uh, I think I'm ready.",1,How I Met Your Mother,43,9
5508,Barney,17, You sure? You want to practice your story one more time?,1,How I Met Your Mother,57,11
5509,Marshall,17," All right. So dude, check it. I'm in San Diego with two of my bro-sephs from Kappa, and they're all, ""Yo, Eriksen, let's roll to the strip clubs."" So I'm, like, ""Snapadoo!"" So we find this choice nudie nest near the airport......and that is when the bouncer kicked us out. Now, I have no idea if Svetlana ever got her green card, but dudes, fake diamond ring? Worth every penny, bruh.",1,How I Met Your Mother,385,71
5514,Ted,17, Uh-oh.,1,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
5517,Ted,17," So she's going to dump me. Has anyone ever said, ""Listen, I've been thinking,"" and then follow it up with something good? It's not like",1,How I Met Your Mother,136,25
5518,Robin,17," I cut off all my fingers? Ted, you're a great guy. I know it, you know it, she knows it. I would bet you a gazillion dollars-- no, I'm even more confident. I would bet you a floppity jillion dollars that she's not calling to break up with you.",1,How I Met Your Mother,244,49
5519,Ted,17," Thanks. You're right. I'm being crazy. So I should still buy that plane ticket, right?",1,How I Met Your Mother,87,15
5520,Robin,17, I'd wait.,1,How I Met Your Mother,10,2
5523,Marshall,17," 'Sup, Blauman? E-bomb here. We still on for karaoke? Dope. I'm going to rock you on the mike so hard your hears are going to bleed gravy. Catch you on the flip, butt puppet.",1,How I Met Your Mother,174,34
5524,Lily,17, Okay...what do you think?,1,How I Met Your Mother,26,4
5525,Marshall,17, Steak sauce.,1,How I Met Your Mother,13,2
5526,Lily,17, Steak sauce?,1,How I Met Your Mother,13,2
5527,Marshall,17, Yeah.,1,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
5528,Lily,17," Look, you know, whatever anthropology you do at work is your business, but please don't act like that around here.",1,How I Met Your Mother,115,20
5529,Marshall,17," Lily, when Dr. Aurelia Birnholz-...",1,How I Met Your Mother,36,5
5530,Lily,17," No, when Dr. Australia Birdbath-Vaseline came home from the gorillas, she didn't run around picking nits out of people's hair and-and throwing feces. I'm begging you just, just leave it at the office.",1,How I Met Your Mother,201,33
5531,Marshall,17, Why?,1,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
5532,Lily,17," Because you're acting like one of those guys, and those guys are lame.",1,How I Met Your Mother,71,13
5533,Marshall,17," Okay, those guys were mean at first, yes, but they're actually good guys, and if you got to know them, then you would see that. Come karaoke with us tonight, and you'll see how totally not that lame they are, okay?",1,How I Met Your Mother,215,41
5534,Lily,17, Okay.,1,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
5538,Lily,17, You're right. They're delightful.,1,How I Met Your Mother,34,4
5539,Marshall,17," So, Barney, you gonna sing anything?",1,How I Met Your Mother,37,6
5540,Barney,17, Nah. I'm so over karaoke.,1,How I Met Your Mother,26,5
5541,Marshall,17, Really? I thought you'd be totally into it.,1,How I Met Your Mother,44,8
5542,Barney,17," Oh, don't get me wrong. I'm good. The best, really. But it's the greatest samurai who lets his sword rust in its scabbard.",1,How I Met Your Mother,123,23
5543,Lily,17," Oh, baby, they have our song. Let's do ""Don't Go Breaking My Heart.""",1,How I Met Your Mother,69,13
5545,Marshall,17," ""Don't Go Breaking My Heart."" Elton John, Kiki Dee.",1,How I Met Your Mother,52,9

5548,Marshall,17," ""Iron Man."" I could do ""Iron Man.""",1,How I Met Your Mother,35,7
5554,Lily,17," Okay, that was gross. When were you going to tell me you changed your entire career path?",1,How I Met Your Mother,90,17
5555,Marshall,17," Nothing has changed, okay? I still want to help the environment. I just thought that maybe I could make some money for a few years. We could buy an apartment, send our kids to good schools. You could quit your job and focus on your painting. I know that you say you don't need it, but... I love you and I want to give it to you anyway. I want to give you the package.",1,How I Met Your Mother,368,75
5556,Lily,17," The package?! You've already given me the package. You've got a great package, Marshall. I love your package.",1,How I Met Your Mother,110,18
5557,Marshall,17," Lily, you're the most incredible woman I know, and you deserve a big package.",1,How I Met Your Mother,78,14
5558,Lily,17," Your package has always been big enough. You may not realize this, Marshall Eriksen, but you've got a huge package.",1,How I Met Your Mother,116,20
5561,Robin,17, Hello.,1,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
5562,Ted,17, Why hasn't she called yet?,1,How I Met Your Mother,27,5
5563,Robin,17," Okay, you're making yourself crazy. It's Saturday night. Go out and do something.",1,How I Met Your Mother,82,13
5564,Ted,17," No, what's the point of going out? I got a girlfriend... for now. Besides, if I go out, who's going to watch the news? I'm, like, half your viewership.",1,How I Met Your Mother,152,29
5565,Robin,17," I'm flattered you think we have two viewers. She's not going to break up with you, Ted. You're awesome.",1,How I Met Your Mother,104,19
5566,Ted,17," Thanks. Anyway, it's almost 11",1,How I Met Your Mother,31,5

5576,Ted,17, I think Victoria's about to break up with me.,1,How I Met Your Mother,46,9
5577,Marshall,17," Oh, God, I'm sorry, man.",1,How I Met Your Mother,25,5
5578,Ted,17," Yeah, well, honestly, I'm having trouble remembering what she looks like. The more I try to picture her, the more I can't. Like, I remember how she makes me feel. I just... I don't completely remember her. It's like I'm trying to preserve something that's already gone.",1,How I Met Your Mother,270,47
5579,Marshall,17, Preserving something that's already gone. Sounds like environmental law.,1,How I Met Your Mother,73,9
5580,Ted,17," I don't know. We struggle so hard to hold onto these things that we know are going to disappear eventually. And that's really noble, but even if you save every rainforest from being turned into a parking lot, well, then where are you going to park your car?",1,How I Met Your Mother,258,48
5584,Marshall,17, *Don't go breakin' my heart*,1,How I Met Your Mother,29,5

5621,Robin,18, Does anyone else have a...? Yes?,1,How I Met Your Mother,33,6

5626,Robin,18," Ha-ha. Laugh now, those kids are monsters. They're going to eat you alive.",1,How I Met Your Mother,75,13
5627,Lily,18, He has a job doing... What do you do?,1,How I Met Your Mother,38,9
5628,Barney,18," Please. Kids, let's rap. You guys don't give half a brown Crayola what I do for a living, do you?",1,How I Met Your Mother,98,20
5630,Barney,18, No. I know what you want. Magic.,1,How I Met Your Mother,33,7

And besides, we want completely different things.",1,How I Met Your Mother,313,56

See, she was supposed to call me four hours ago to have a serious talk. I still haven't heard from her. I don't know. Sorry to bug you with my problems. Guess cab drivers are the new bartenders, huh?",1,How I Met Your Mother,329,63
5670,Ted,18, You can just let me out right up here.,1,How I Met Your Mother,39,9

5686,Marshall,18," Hey, did she call?",1,How I Met Your Mother,19,4
5687,Ted,18," No. I need a ruling. Um, I'm... Yeah, this is stupid. It's not even a big deal, but I'm on my way over to Robin's right now. She got a new juicer. Whatever. We're going to test it out.",1,How I Met Your Mother,185,39

5700,Ted,18," Come on, pick up. Damn it, Victoria, where are you? Pick up, pick up!",1,How I Met Your Mother,70,14
5702,Ted,18," No, thanks. Where are you? Why haven't you called?",1,How I Met Your Mother,51,9
5704,Ted,18, Yeah. Why do I doubt that? Hello.,1,How I Met Your Mother,34,7
5705,Marshall,18," Ted, I just saw the news and a truck carrying sulphuric acid overturned right in front of Robin's house. And it's melting through the sidewalk. You can see straight down into hell. It's bad. You should go home, dude.",1,How I Met Your Mother,217,39
5706,Ted,18," Marshall, it's fine. Nothing's going to happen.",1,How I Met Your Mother,48,7
5707,Marshall,18," Ted, what does your mom always say?",1,How I Met Your Mother,36,7
5708,Ted,18, Nothing good ever...,1,How I Met Your Mother,21,3
5709,Marshall,18, Nothing good ever happens after 2,1,How I Met Your Mother,34,6
5710,Ted,18," Dude, Robin and I are just friends. She doesn't even like me that way.",1,How I Met Your Mother,71,14
5711,Lily,18," Yes, she does! She likes you. She told me.",1,How I Met Your Mother,43,9
5712,Ted,18, What?,1,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
5713,Lily,18," It's a big secret, so don't tell her I told you, but she's very vulnerable right now and you have a girlfriend. Go home, Ted.",1,How I Met Your Mother,126,25
5714,Ted,18, She-she likes me?,1,How I Met Your Mother,18,3
5715,Lily,18," Yes. So you see why it would be a very bad idea for you to go up there. Go home, Ted.",1,How I Met Your Mother,86,21
5716,Ted,18, She likes me?,1,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
5717,Lily,18," Go home, Ted.",1,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
5718,Ted,18," Uh, you're right. I'll, uh, I'll see you at home.",1,How I Met Your Mother,50,10
5719,Lily,18, Good. He's going home.,1,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
5720,Marshall,18, He is so not going home. I cannot believe you just told him that.,1,How I Met Your Mother,66,14
5721,Lily,18, What do you mean?,1,How I Met Your Mother,18,4
5722,Marshall,18," Lily, here's what you just said",1,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
5723,Lily,18," No, he's not going up there. He has more sense than that.",1,How I Met Your Mother,58,12
5725,Ted,18, Keep the change.,1,How I Met Your Mother,17,3
5729,Ted,18, You want to get out of the way?,1,How I Met Your Mother,32,8
5731,Ted,18," You know, if you had just called me, I...",1,How I Met Your Mother,42,9
5732,Robin,18, Hi.,1,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
5733,Ted,18," Hi. Um, I got some vegetables. I got carrots, I got beets.",1,How I Met Your Mother,59,12
5734,Robin,18, Or we could just drink wine.,1,How I Met Your Mother,29,6
5735,Ted,18," Wine... not? Well, that's the stupidest thing I've ever said.",1,How I Met Your Mother,62,10
5736,Robin,18, Thanks.,1,How I Met Your Mother,8,1
5737,Ted,18, Make it a big glass.,1,How I Met Your Mother,21,5
5738,Robin,18, Sure.,1,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
5739,Ted,18," So, how's it hanging?",1,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
5740,Robin,18, Have you ever had one of those days where nothing at all that monumental happens but by the end of it you have no idea who you are anymore or what the hell you're doing with your life? Do you ever have one of those days?,1,How I Met Your Mother,221,46
5741,Ted,18," Uh, about once a week.",1,How I Met Your Mother,23,5
5742,Robin,18," I don't know, it was just a, a rough day and the only person I wanted to see at the end of it was you. So... um... how was the big phone call with your girlfriend?",1,How I Met Your Mother,164,36
5744,Ted,18, We broke up.,1,How I Met Your Mother,13,3
5745,Robin,18, What?,1,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
5746,Ted,18," Yeah. Yeah, she finally called. We talked for a while-- how hard long distance is-- and then... she dumped me.",1,How I Met Your Mother,111,20
5747,Robin,18," Oh, Ted, I'm so sorry. That's just terrible. I feel awful.",1,How I Met Your Mother,59,11
5748,Ted,18, You're smiling.,1,How I Met Your Mother,16,2
5749,Robin,18," Am I? No I'm not. I'm a news anchor. Smiling's a part of the job. Thousands died in a tragic avalanche today. See? You're smiling, too.",1,How I Met Your Mother,136,26
5750,Ted,18, Yeah. I have no idea what that's all about.,1,How I Met Your Mother,44,9
5754,Marshall,18, How much does Korean Elvis rock? I'll answer that. Infinity. He rocks... infinity.,1,How I Met Your Mother,83,13
5755,Lily,18," Okay, it's time for bed.",1,How I Met Your Mother,25,5
5756,Barney,18, What? No. It's 2,1,How I Met Your Mother,17,4
5757,Lily,18, Nothing good ever happens after 2,1,How I Met Your Mother,34,6
5758,Barney,18," You know, I have found, in my travels... that all the best things in life happen after 2",1,How I Met Your Mother,89,18
5759,Marshall,18, You never had a four-way.,1,How I Met Your Mother,26,5
5760,Barney,18," I said ""almost."" All those things happened after 2",1,How I Met Your Mother,51,9
5761,Lily,18, We're going home.,1,How I Met Your Mother,18,3
5762,Barney,18," What's that? Interesting theory, Barney, but I'll need some proof? Okay. Korean Elvis. How would you like to have a drink with me and my friends?",1,How I Met Your Mother,146,26
5764,Barney,18, And it begins.,1,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
5766,Ted,18," So, um... Hey. I got a new phone. Same as yours. Look.",1,How I Met Your Mother,55,12
5767,Robin,18," Oh, yeah. Do you like it?",1,How I Met Your Mother,26,6
5768,Ted,18," Yeah. Yeah. This is some solid small talk. I had that other phone, and it was good, but I think the whole time a little part of me wanted this phone instead. This phone... um... feels right.",1,How I Met Your Mother,191,37
5770,Robin,18, Wow. Weird.,1,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
5771,Ted,18," Yeah. Uh, I should probably take this.",1,How I Met Your Mother,39,7
5772,Robin,18, I'll be here.,1,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
5774,Ted,18, Hello?,1,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
5776,Marshall,18, Sorry about that.,1,How I Met Your Mother,18,3
5777,Ted,18, Was that Korean Elvis?,1,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
5778,Marshall,18," I'll explain later. Hey, we're headed down to MacLaren's.",1,How I Met Your Mother,58,9
5779,Ted,18," Um... Actually... I'm at Robin's. Yeah, and, um... I might have done something bad. I just lied and told her I broke up with Victoria.",1,How I Met Your Mother,135,25
5780,Marshall,18," Ted, I don't want to swear in front of Korean Elvis, but what the bleep are you doing, dude?",1,How I Met Your Mother,93,19
5781,Ted,18," What do you expect from me? It's Robin. Victoria's great, but, it's Robin. I've made up my mind. I'm going to end it with Victoria.",1,How I Met Your Mother,132,25
5782,Lily,18, Gonna?,1,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
5783,Ted,18, Yes. First thing tomorrow.,1,How I Met Your Mother,27,4
5784,Lily,18," Okay, but, but, as of right now at-at... 2",1,How I Met Your Mother,43,9
5785,Ted,18, I hate how you're always right.,1,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
5786,Lily,18, It's my best and most annoying trait.,1,How I Met Your Mother,38,7
5787,Ted,18, Okay. I'm coming home. I'll see you soon.,1,How I Met Your Mother,42,8
5789,Robin,18, Hey.,1,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
5790,Ted,18, I should probably get going. It's pretty late. I'm sorry. I...,1,How I Met Your Mother,63,11
5791,Robin,18," Oh. Oh, no. I understand. It's fine. Yeah.",1,How I Met Your Mother,43,8
5792,Ted,18, Can I call you tomorrow?,1,How I Met Your Mother,25,5
5793,Robin,18, Totally. Totally. Call me tomorrow.,1,How I Met Your Mother,36,5
5794,Ted,18," Okay. Good night, Robin.",1,How I Met Your Mother,25,4
5795,Robin,18," Good night, Ted.",1,How I Met Your Mother,17,3
5797,Robin,18," Oh, my God. We're making out.",1,How I Met Your Mother,30,6
5798,Ted,18, Right.,1,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
5799,Robin,18, This is crazy.,1,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
5800,Ted,18, Right? Right?,1,How I Met Your Mother,14,2
5801,Robin,18," Should we go to my room? I mean, there's five dogs in there, but...",1,How I Met Your Mother,68,14
5802,Ted,18, Yeah.,1,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
5803,Robin,18, Yeah?,1,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
5804,Ted,18," Yeah. I just, um... I have to run to the bathroom real quick.",1,How I Met Your Mother,62,13
5805,Robin,18, Okay.,1,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
5807,Ted,18, Stop doing that.,1,How I Met Your Mother,17,3
5809,Ted,18," I'm calling you. We're breaking up. I'm doing this right now, I'm coming out of this bathroom a single man.",1,How I Met Your Mother,108,20
5811,Ted,18, What do you want from me? People break up. It happens.,1,How I Met Your Mother,55,11
5813,Ted,18, It's not ideal.,1,How I Met Your Mother,16,3
5816,Barney,18," Come on, Lily. How many women can say they've been personally serenaded by Korean Elvis?",1,How I Met Your Mother,89,15
5817,Lily,18, I think he just spat on me.,1,How I Met Your Mother,28,7
5818,Marshall,18," Barney, you tried, I think that's great, but we're going.",1,How I Met Your Mother,58,10
5819,Barney,18," No! No, come on.",1,How I Met Your Mother,17,4
5820,Marshall,18, Yes!,1,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
5821,Barney,18," Dude, we haen't hit legendary yet. We're only at the ""le"". We still got the ""gen."" The ""da."" The ""ry.""",1,How I Met Your Mother,103,20
5822,Lily,18," Okay, if we're at the ""le,"" then I say we follow it up with a ""t's go home.""",1,How I Met Your Mother,77,18
5823,Marshall,18," Oh, wow, you just got burned, phonics style.",1,How I Met Your Mother,45,8
5825,Lily,18," Okay, seriously.",1,How I Met Your Mother,17,2
5828,Marshall,18," Hey, you guys remember the time that Lily kicked Korean Elvis in the Nards?",1,How I Met Your Mother,76,14
5830,Ted,18, You're right. I owe you a real breakup call. I'll call you tomorrow.,1,How I Met Your Mother,69,13
5832,Ted,18," Why should I have to go home? You know, there's every chance Robin's the woman I'm going to marry.",1,How I Met Your Mother,99,19
5834,Ted,18," It could happen. And so really, what's it gonna matter in 50 years if I jump the gun by one night? Look, I-I know this is a moral gray area, but... It's Robin. And I'm exhausted. I am. I'm exhausted from pretending I'm not in love with her. I think that makes this okay.",1,How I Met Your Mother,271,54
5836,Ted,18," Yes, I do. You got me. That is exactly what I want right now. And so what? I want this. She wants this. It's happening, and if you have a problem with it, don't be in Germany. It's been nice pretending to talk to you. Thanks for not calling me and good night.",1,How I Met Your Mother,260,53
5838,Ted,18, This isn't my phone.,1,How I Met Your Mother,21,4
5840,Robin,18," Okay. Bye.  I thought it was mine, so I answered it.",1,How I Met Your Mother,53,11
5841,Ted,18, Was it...?,1,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
5842,Robin,18, It was your girlfriend. You might want to call her back.,1,How I Met Your Mother,57,11
5845,Ted,19," Her favorite CD in the Otis Redding box set? Disc three. My favorite? Any guesses? Anyone? Come on. Disc three! God, Victoria's so amazing! I could talk about her for hours.",1,How I Met Your Mother,174,31
5846,Lily,19," What do you mean ""could""?",1,How I Met Your Mother,26,5
5847,Ted,19," I'm sorry, it's just... God, I... I'm crazy about this girl. It feels like maybe... I don't want to say it.",1,How I Met Your Mother,108,21
5848,Barney,19," Trust that impulse, Ted.",1,How I Met Your Mother,25,4
5849,Robin,19," Hey. Something kind of cool just happened. My story on Pickles, the Singing Dog, just got nominated for a Local Area Media Award.",1,How I Met Your Mother,130,23
5850,Lily,19, A... LAME-A?,1,How I Met Your Mother,13,2
5851,Robin,19," We prefer Local Area Media Award. Um... there's going to be this big banquet. I know these things aren't much fun, but it would really mean a lot to me if you guys came. And there's an open bar.",1,How I Met Your Mother,195,39
5853,Ted,19," Yeah, put me down for two.",1,How I Met Your Mother,27,6
5854,Robin,19, Really? It's three months away.,1,How I Met Your Mother,32,5
5855,Ted,19," I know, but... guys, I'm sorry, I'm going to say it. I have a feeling Victoria's going to be around for a long time.",1,How I Met Your Mother,117,24
5857,Ted,19, I'm going to miss Victoria. I should just skip this thing entirely. Robin's still pissed at me after... you know.,1,How I Met Your Mother,114,20
5858,Barney,19, You lied and said you were broken up with Victoria before you actually were so you could try to nail Robin and you wound up losing both girls in one night?,1,How I Met Your Mother,156,31
5859,Ted,19," Yes, that's what I meant by ""you know."" I haven't seen her in three weeks. She won't return my calls. Look, I shouldn't go.",1,How I Met Your Mother,124,24
5860,Marshall,19," You should definitely go. Look, it's a chance to show her you're still friends and that you support her.",1,How I Met Your Mother,105,19
5861,Barney,19," Or it's a chance to mess with her head by showing up with someone hotter. Even better, triple threat-- hotter and bigger boobs.",1,How I Met Your Mother,128,23
5862,Ted,19, That's only two.,1,How I Met Your Mother,17,3
5863,Barney,19, Count again.,1,How I Met Your Mother,13,2
5864,Ted,19," Barney, I'm not bringing a date. Even if I wanted to, the thing's in two hours.",1,How I Met Your Mother,80,16
5865,Barney,19, So get an escort.,1,How I Met Your Mother,18,4
5866,Ted,19," By ""escort,"" you mean prostitute?",1,How I Met Your Mother,34,5
5867,Barney,19, Why not?,1,How I Met Your Mother,9,2
5868,Ted,19, Because... gross?,1,How I Met Your Mother,18,2
5869,Barney,19," Oh, gross. What, you have some puritanical hang-up about prostitution? Dude, it's the world's oldest profession.",1,How I Met Your Mother,113,16
5870,Marshall,19, You really think that's true?,1,How I Met Your Mother,30,5
5871,Barney,19," Oh, yeah. I bet even Cro-Magnons used to give cave hookers, like, an extra fish for putting out.",1,How I Met Your Mother,97,18
5872,Marshall,19," Aha, so then the oldest profession would be fishermen. Kaboom! You've been lawyered.",1,How I Met Your Mother,85,13
5873,Barney,19," Come on, Ted, let's get you a hooker. It'll be fun.",1,How I Met Your Mother,52,11
5874,Ted,19," Okay, to bring to the banquet and hang out with ironically or to actually have s*x with?",1,How I Met Your Mother,89,17
5875,Barney,19, Yes.,1,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
5876,Ted,19, No! It's illegal. And did I mention gross?,1,How I Met Your Mother,43,8
5877,Barney,19," That's adorable. Ted, you're such a hayseed. The companionship business is the growth industry of the 21st century. You do realize that one out of every eight adult women in America is a prostitute.",1,How I Met Your Mother,199,34
5878,Marshall,19, You just made that up.,1,How I Met Your Mother,23,5
5879,Barney,19, Withdrawn.,1,How I Met Your Mother,11,1
5880,Marshall,19," Lawyered. The point is, how long has it been?",1,How I Met Your Mother,46,9
5881,Ted,19, 57 days.,1,How I Met Your Mother,9,2
5882,Barney,19, Is that your water? May I?,1,How I Met Your Mother,27,6
5883,Ted,19," Yeah, go ahead.",1,How I Met Your Mother,16,3
5884,Barney,19," Much obliged. 57 days?! Ted, you are in a slump.",1,How I Met Your Mother,49,10
5885,Ted,19," No, it's not a slump. It's an intentional hiatus from girls. A slump is when you strike out every time you step up to the plate. But I'm off the roster, baby. I'm in the locker room sitting in the whirlpool. And I'll tell you something, it feels pretty good.",1,How I Met Your Mother,259,50
5886,Barney,19," Yeah, you know what else is in that locker room? A naked dudes hanging brain. Ted, you need a lady. And I've got the next best thing-- Mary. She lives in my building. She's smart, she's hot, she's totally cool.",1,How I Met Your Mother,211,40
5887,Ted,19," Oh, she sounds great. And who knows? Maybe we'll wind up getting married someday. You know, if we can get a blessing from her pimp.",1,How I Met Your Mother,132,25
5888,Barney,19, You want to judge a fellow human being based solely on one external characteristic? That's racism. And I do not drink with racists. Good day.,1,How I Met Your Mother,142,25
5889,Ted,19," You're just waiting for me to speak, so you can...",1,How I Met Your Mother,51,10
5890,Barney,19, I said good day!,1,How I Met Your Mother,17,4
5892,Robin,19, So should I wear my hair up or down? Lily.,1,How I Met Your Mother,43,10
5893,Lily,19, What?,1,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
5894,Robin,19, You okay?,1,How I Met Your Mother,10,2
5895,Lily,19," Oh, yeah, sorry. I'm just exhausted from work. The stupid school board took away nap time in all kindergarten classes and now the kids are just going crazy by the end of the day. It's much harder to deal with because, well, I don't get my nap.",1,How I Met Your Mother,244,47
5896,Robin,19," Wait, you were taking naps when the kids were? Is that safe?",1,How I Met Your Mother,61,12
5897,Lily,19," Well, they're only five. What are they gonna do to me?",1,How I Met Your Mother,55,11
5898,Robin,19," Ted's still coming to this thing, right?",1,How I Met Your Mother,41,7
5899,Lily,19, Yep.,1,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
5900,Robin,19," Do you think, um... hypothetically... it would be weird if I bring a date?",1,How I Met Your Mother,75,14
5901,Lily,19," Look at you, Scherbotsky, blatantly trying to make Ted jealous.",1,How I Met Your Mother,64,10
5902,Robin,19," No, it's just this guy at the station. I never get involved with co-workers, but he asked me and I said yes. Is it going to be weird?",1,How I Met Your Mother,134,28
5903,Lily,19," No, it's not going to be weird at all.  Robin's bringing a date.",1,How I Met Your Mother,65,13
5904,Marshall,19, Boy. That's going to be really weird.,1,How I Met Your Mother,38,7
5905,Lily,19, I know.,1,How I Met Your Mother,8,2
5907,Marshall,19, Robin's bringing a date.,1,How I Met Your Mother,25,4
5908,Ted,19, Oh. Okay. That's not weird. She's bringing a date. I'm glad she's moving on.,1,How I Met Your Mother,77,14
5909,Marshall,19," Dude, it's going to be weird.",1,How I Met Your Mother,30,6
5910,Ted,19," No, it's fine. Look, in spite of whatever happened between us, Robin and I are still friends. I don't think it'll be weird.",1,How I Met Your Mother,124,23
5911,Barney,19," Yeah, it won't be weird.",1,How I Met Your Mother,25,5
5912,Ted,19, Thank you.,1,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
5913,Barney,19, Because you're going to bring your own date.,1,How I Met Your Mother,45,8
5915,Barney,19," Hi, Mary. Have you met Ted?",1,How I Met Your Mother,28,6
5917,Ted,19," Hi, Mary. Wow. It's, uh, nice to meet you, too.",1,How I Met Your Mother,48,10
5919,Ted,19," Uh, yeah, will you just excuse us for one minute? Barney.",1,How I Met Your Mother,58,11
5920,Barney,19," See you in two shakes, Mare. You two make yourselves comfortable.",1,How I Met Your Mother,66,11
5921,Ted,19, What the hell?,1,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
5922,Barney,19," Dude, your narrow-minded views on professional fornicators were harshing my mellow. So I got you a date for the evening.",1,How I Met Your Mother,121,20
5923,Ted,19, You got me a hooker. A really hot hook-- A hooker!,1,How I Met Your Mother,51,11
5924,Barney,19," Think about it, this is perfect. A",1,How I Met Your Mother,35,7
5925,Ted,19, I'm not taking a prostitute to Robin's banquet.,1,How I Met Your Mother,48,8
5926,Barney,19," The only people who will know are you, me and Marshall. No one will suspect a thing. They'll just see you with this unbelievably smoking hot girl and... Okay, that's a little bit suspicious. Look, I'm just trying to expand your horizons a little bit tonight. But if you're not interested, fine, I'm out 500 bucks. Whatever.",1,How I Met Your Mother,324,57
5927,Ted,19, 500 bucks?,1,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
5928,Barney,19," Ted, you're my cabron. You think I'm gonna stick you with some toothless tranny from the Port Authority? Look at how hot she is. Robin would be so jealous.",1,How I Met Your Mother,156,29
5929,Ted,19," I'm not trying to make Robin jealous, Barney. Look, I... tell Mary, thanks, but no thanks. I have a soul.",1,How I Met Your Mother,106,20
5931,Marshall,19, Check out Robin's date.,1,How I Met Your Mother,24,4
5932,Ted,19, I know.,1,How I Met Your Mother,8,2

5937,Ted,19, Sandy time. Sandy time!,1,How I Met Your Mother,24,4
5941,Ted,19," Which Sandy do we want today? French Sandy, p0rn star Sandy...?",1,How I Met Your Mother,64,11
5942,Marshall,19," Yosemite Sandy, definitely.",1,How I Met Your Mother,28,3
5943,Ted,19, Excellent choice. I love this guy.,1,How I Met Your Mother,35,6

5954,Robin,19," Oh, um, Ted, this is Sandy.",1,How I Met Your Mother,28,6
5956,Ted,19," Hi, Sandy. Rivers. So are you two, uh...",1,How I Met Your Mother,41,8
5958,Ted,19," Oh, how rude of me. Uh, Robin, Sandy... Rivers... this is Mary, my date.",1,How I Met Your Mother,73,14
5962,Marshall,19," Man, Vampire Lou just looks great.",1,How I Met Your Mother,35,6
5963,Ted,19, I can't believe I'm on a date with a hooker.,1,How I Met Your Mother,45,10
5964,Marshall,19," Yeah, I can't believe you let her and Lily go to the ladies' room together, man. Secrets come out in there.",1,How I Met Your Mother,108,21
5965,Barney,19," Oh, please. How's it's going to come out? ""Uh, pass me a towel. P.S., I have s*x for money.""",1,How I Met Your Mother,93,19
5966,Lily,19, Who has s*x for money?,1,How I Met Your Mother,23,5
5967,Marshall,19, Nobody. What did you guys talk about in there? Anything interesting?,1,How I Met Your Mother,69,11
5968,Lily,19," No, not really. We just chitchatted and I borrowed her lipstick. Why is Vampire Lou the host of a Saturday Afternoon Kung Fu Movie? You know, it just makes no sense. God, that pisses me off.",1,How I Met Your Mother,191,36
5969,Ted,19," Lily, you okay?",1,How I Met Your Mother,16,3
5970,Lily,19," Oh, yeah, I'm just tired. And when I get tired, I get cranky.",1,How I Met Your Mother,62,13
5972,Lily,19," ""Really? I couldn't imagine you cranky.""",1,How I Met Your Mother,41,6
5974,Lily,19," Well, I teach kindergarten and the school board took away my nap time, the kids' nap time.",1,How I Met Your Mother,91,17
5975,Barney,19," Lily, quit your job. Work at a private school. You won't have to deal with the school board, and you'll make a ton more money.",1,How I Met Your Mother,127,25
5976,Lily,19," Well, guess what, Barney? I don't base all my life decisions on how much money I'm going to make, unlike you and, sadly, my fiance.",1,How I Met Your Mother,132,25
5977,Marshall,19," Well, it's just an internship, for the record.",1,How I Met Your Mother,47,8
5978,Lily,19," Yeah, because if I did sacrifice all my values just for an easy buck, what would that make me?",1,How I Met Your Mother,95,19
5980,Lily,19," Exactly. Thank you, Mary.",1,How I Met Your Mother,26,4

5982,Barney,19, She's a paralegal.,1,How I Met Your Mother,19,3
5984,Robin,19," Oh, so, Mary the paralegal. What does a paralegal do exactly?",1,How I Met Your Mother,62,11
5986,Lily,19," Oh, what firm?",1,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
5988,Marshall,19, That's a real law firm.,1,How I Met Your Mother,24,5
5990,Marshall,19, Nice.,1,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
5991,Ted,19, You're pretty good on your feet.,1,How I Met Your Mother,33,6
5993,Ted,19, Is that allowed?,1,How I Met Your Mother,17,3
5995,Ted,19," You know, I wouldn't normally say this on a first date, but... well, considering... I'm just going to say it. You are so hot!",1,How I Met Your Mother,126,24
5997,Ted,19, You're welcome.,1,How I Met Your Mother,16,2
5998,Robin,19," Mary, Ted is a great guy. You hold on to him. Don't let him out of your sight for a minute.",1,How I Met Your Mother,92,21
5999,Ted,19," So, Sandy, what do you do? Oh, wait, I know what you do. You're the guy who reads the paper in the morning.",1,How I Met Your Mother,108,23
6001,Ted,19," Oh, same thing as you-- I read the paper every morning. But then after that, I finish my coffee and I go to my real job as an architect where I make an actual contribution to the world. I'm just kidding. Love your show. You're terrific.",1,How I Met Your Mother,237,46
6004,Ted,19," You just insulted someone I hate by referencing something I love. Damn, you just got even hotter.",1,How I Met Your Mother,98,17
6006,Ted,19, Hey.,1,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
6007,Robin,19," Hey. Mary seems nice. Have you kissed her yet, or are you waiting until you're in a serious relationship with someone else?",1,How I Met Your Mother,124,22
6008,Ted,19," I, uh... I wanted to apologize for everything that happened.",1,How I Met Your Mother,61,10
6009,Robin,19," And just like that, it's all okay. Roll credits.",1,How I Met Your Mother,49,9
6010,Ted,19," So you're going to be mad at me forever? What, we're not even friends now?",1,How I Met Your Mother,75,15
6011,Robin,19, We're still friends.,1,How I Met Your Mother,21,3
6012,Ted,19," Are we? You don't return my calls, we never hang out and now you're trying to make my jealous by waving Edward R. Moron in my face?",1,How I Met Your Mother,132,27
6013,Robin,19," Oh, and Paralegally Blonde isn't here in her low-cut dress to make me jealous?",1,How I Met Your Mother,79,14
6014,Ted,19," Oh, so now she's a whore?",1,How I Met Your Mother,26,6
6015,Robin,19, What?,1,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
6016,Ted,19," You know something? Mary the paralegal is awesome. And you know what else? I didn't come here tonight to make you jealous, I came here to support you as a friend. And frankly, I'm sick of trying.",1,How I Met Your Mother,196,37
6018,Ted,19, Hey.,1,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
6020,Ted,19," Oh, I was, uh, just telling my friend that I think you're awesome.",1,How I Met Your Mother,67,13
6022,Ted,19," Oh, yeah, my friend did the remodel. You should see the rooms. The views are amazing.",1,How I Met Your Mother,86,16
6024,Barney,19," Room 1506. My treat. You kids go nuts. Actually, don't use the mini-bar. Do it. Come on, Ted, do it. This is one of those things you have to do before you turn 30.",1,How I Met Your Mother,164,34
6025,Ted,19, Sleep with a prostitute?,1,How I Met Your Mother,25,4
6026,Barney,19," No, lose your virginity. What up. Statistic-- men who have had at least one relationship with a prostitute are 75% more likely to have success in future relationships.",1,How I Met Your Mother,168,28
6027,Marshall,19, You just made that up.,1,How I Met Your Mother,23,5
6028,Barney,19, Withdrawn.,1,How I Met Your Mother,11,1
6029,Marshall,19," Lawyered. Okay, three things. First of all, Robin's category's almost up. And second of all, you cannot do this. It's wrong on every level. And third, I've been placing small items in Sandy's hair all night. He still hasn't noticed.",1,How I Met Your Mother,233,40
6030,Ted,19, I know I can't do this. I'm not doing this. It's just... it's a shame. She's really cool.,1,How I Met Your Mother,90,18
6031,Marshall,19," Yeah, well... there we go.",1,How I Met Your Mother,27,5
6033,Robin,19," Thanks. Oh, wow. This is really a surprise. Um, you know it's nice to be able to share this award with my friends. They're all here tonight. Marshall, Lily, Sandy Rivers... Barney... And that's it. Those are all my friends. Thank you.",1,How I Met Your Mother,235,42
6034,Marshall,19, Congratulations.,1,How I Met Your Mother,17,1
6035,Robin,19," Oh, thanks. Um, Sandy, do you want to get a cab?",1,How I Met Your Mother,49,11
6037,Ted,19," Yeah, this party's dead. Mary, you want to go upstairs? We, uh, got a room.",1,How I Met Your Mother,76,15
6038,Marshall,19," Dude, what are you doing?",1,How I Met Your Mother,26,5
6039,Ted,19, What's it look like?,1,How I Met Your Mother,21,4
6040,Marshall,19," It looks bad, is what it looks like. You cannot do this.",1,How I Met Your Mother,57,12
6041,Ted,19," Marshall, she is a really cool girl when you get to know her. Besides, I'm trying to make Robin jealous.",1,How I Met Your Mother,105,20
6042,Marshall,19," Oh, that's real mature.",1,How I Met Your Mother,24,4
6043,Lily,19," Marshall, what is up with you and Ted?",1,How I Met Your Mother,39,8
6044,Marshall,19," Nothing, baby. Don't worry about it. Fine. Do what you want. Hey.",1,How I Met Your Mother,66,12
6046,Ted,19, Yeah. Thanks. Well... Good night.,1,How I Met Your Mother,34,5
6047,Robin,19, Good night.,1,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
6050,Ted,19," So, did you and Barney ever...?",1,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
6052,Ted,19," Oh, thank God.",1,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
6053,Marshall,19," Wow, so they're...? Robin, where's Sandy Rivers?",1,How I Met Your Mother,49,7
6054,Robin,19, I put him in a cab.,1,How I Met Your Mother,20,6
6055,Barney,19, So you and he aren't...?,1,How I Met Your Mother,25,5
6056,Robin,19, I don't date people I work with. I was just trying to make Ted jealous. Is he...?,1,How I Met Your Mother,82,17
6057,Marshall,19, He's off trying to make you jealous.,1,How I Met Your Mother,37,7
6058,Robin,19," Oh, well, good for them. And, you know, if Ted likes her, she's probably pretty cool.",1,How I Met Your Mother,86,16
6059,Marshall,19," Lily, I know you're asleep, but I have to tell someone this, and we tell each other everything. So, here it goes. Mary's not a paralegal. She's a prostitute.",1,How I Met Your Mother,158,29
6061,Robin,19, What?!,1,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
6062,Marshall,19, Barney paid for her.,1,How I Met Your Mother,21,4
6063,Lily,19, Is that true?,1,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
6064,Marshall,19," We were having a conversation about prostitution, and then Barney calls her up and then she shows up at the bar and now she and Ted are upstairs.",1,How I Met Your Mother,146,28
6065,Robin,19," Okay, seriously, what is going on with Ted lately? Is he having a nervous breakdown?",1,How I Met Your Mother,85,15
6066,Lily,19," You know, Barney, for anyone else, this would be a new low, but sadly, for you, it's just a new middle. Oh, my God, I used her lipstick! Ah!",1,How I Met Your Mother,141,29
6067,Marshall,19, That's her napkin.,1,How I Met Your Mother,19,3
6068,Lily,19, No!,1,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
6069,Barney,19," Okay, well, I guess now is as good a time as any. In keeping with tonight's award show motif, I'd like to announce this evening's big twist ending! Vampire Lou, would you do the honors?",1,How I Met Your Mother,186,35
6071,Marshall,19, What?,1,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
6072,Barney,19," That's all, Vampire Lou. Nicely done.",1,How I Met Your Mother,38,6
6073,Marshall,19, So she's not...?,1,How I Met Your Mother,17,3
6074,Barney,19," No. Mary's just a paralegal who lives in my building. Oh-- ha-ha! And here's the best part-- she has no idea that Ted thinks she's a hooker. Oh, come on. If you don't laugh, it just seems mean.",1,How I Met Your Mother,194,38
6076,Ted,19, I feel kind of like Richard Gere.,1,How I Met Your Mother,34,7
6078,Ted,19," No. You know, Mary, I've never done this before.",1,How I Met Your Mother,49,9
6080,Ted,19," You know, been... on a ""date.""",1,How I Met Your Mother,31,6
6082,Ted,19," No. Why, is that so odd?",1,How I Met Your Mother,25,6
6084,Ted,19," God, you were just a kid. Well, look, let's just have a few drinks. We'll relax and...",1,How I Met Your Mother,87,17
6086,Ted,19, Must be tough.,1,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
6088,Ted,19," Okay, look, Mary, I like you a lot. I'm sort of amazed at how much I like you, but I can't do this. You're a hooker.",1,How I Met Your Mother,117,26
6090,Ted,19," Look, maybe I'm old-fashioned, but I'm sorry, that's a deal-breaker for me. I'm not going to have s*x with a prostitute.",1,How I Met Your Mother,121,21
6092,Ted,19," Come on, Mary, there's no one else around. You're a hooker.",1,How I Met Your Mother,60,11
6094,Ted,19," No, you're a hooker.",1,How I Met Your Mother,21,4
6096,Ted,19, You're a paralegal.,1,How I Met Your Mother,20,3
6098,Ted,19, That was not funny.,1,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
6099,Marshall,19," Not funny, dude.",1,How I Met Your Mother,17,3
6100,Barney,19," I know, it was hilarious.",1,How I Met Your Mother,26,5
6101,Ted,19, Why would you do that?,1,How I Met Your Mother,23,5
6102,Barney,19, I did it to prove a point.,1,How I Met Your Mother,27,7
6103,Ted,19, What point?,1,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
6104,Barney,19," Stay with me. It's going to come to me. No. Ah, okay, here's the point. You thought that Mary was a sure thing, right? So what happened? She took you up to a hotel room on the first date. All you have to do is be that confident with every girl you meet and your slump is over.",1,How I Met Your Mother,277,58
6105,Ted,19," So the message is, I should treat every woman like a whore?",1,How I Met Your Mother,60,12
6106,Barney,19," Come on, dude, you should be thanking me.",1,How I Met Your Mother,42,8
6107,Ted,19, She slapped me and stormed off.,1,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
6108,Barney,19, Can you blame her? You called her a hooker.,1,How I Met Your Mother,44,9
6109,Marshall,19," I'm sorry, dude, it was funny.",1,How I Met Your Mother,31,6
6110,Ted,19," Yeah. Well, it's getting late. I should get back to my room.",1,How I Met Your Mother,61,12
6111,Barney,19, Your room?,1,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
6112,Ted,19," Yeah, that really expensive hotel room you put on your credit card-- never checked out. By the way, you know what's super fun? Pouring Dom Perignon down a bathtub drain. Well, it's almost 3",1,How I Met Your Mother,190,34
6114,Marshall,19," Come on, if you don't laugh, it just seems mean.",1,How I Met Your Mother,49,10
6118,Marshall,20, Van Smoot is available.,1,How I Met Your Mother,24,4
6119,Lily,20," Oh, my God!",1,How I Met Your Mother,12,3
6121,Marshall,20, There was a cancellation two months from now.,1,How I Met Your Mother,46,8
6122,Lily,20, You want to have our wedding in two months? No. It's impossible.,1,How I Met Your Mother,65,12
6123,Marshall,20," It's Van Smoot, Lily. It's the dream!",1,How I Met Your Mother,38,7
6124,Lily,20," No, there's just not enough time. There's no way... Oh! Mini-vomit.",1,How I Met Your Mother,68,11
6125,Marshall,20," Okay, look, look, look. I know that it's sudden, but check it. If we don't take this, guess who's on their way with a deposit check.",1,How I Met Your Mother,133,26
6126,Lily,20, Todd and Valerie?,1,How I Met Your Mother,18,3
6129,Marshall,20, We got to make a decision. Todd and Valerie are in motion. Van Smoot!,1,How I Met Your Mother,70,14
6130,Lily,20," Oh! Kids, color! Come on, baby.",1,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
6131,Marshall,20," Come on, come on, come on.",1,How I Met Your Mother,27,6
6133,Marshall,20, Todd. Valerie. Stairs.,1,How I Met Your Mother,23,3
6135,Lily,20, I can't believe it. We got Van Smoot House.,1,How I Met Your Mother,44,9
6136,Marshall,20, It is on. It is on! Like the former Soviet Republic of Azerbaijan.,1,How I Met Your Mother,67,13
6137,Robin,20, What?,1,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
6138,Marshall,20, You're a wonder.,1,How I Met Your Mother,17,3
6139,Ted,20, Wow! You guys are getting married in two months.,1,How I Met Your Mother,49,9
6140,Robin,20, How are you going to get everything done?,1,How I Met Your Mother,42,8
6141,Lily,20," Division of labor. Everyone's got a job to do, so listen up. Okay, Robin, you and Ted go to the florist.",1,How I Met Your Mother,105,21
6144,Ted,20, Was it...?,1,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
6145,Robin,20, It was your girlfriend. You might want to call her back.,1,How I Met Your Mother,57,11
6147,Lily,20," Or, actually, Robin, why don't you go to the florist? And, Ted, I could use your keen architectural eye on... on the invitations.",1,How I Met Your Mother,130,23
6148,Marshall,20," Wow. That was really awkward, Lil. And still. It's still really awkward right now.",1,How I Met Your Mother,83,14
6149,Barney,20," Hey, what about me? What's my job? What do I get to do?",1,How I Met Your Mother,56,13
6150,Lily,20," Okay, your job is very simple. At the wedding, do not sleep with anyone even remotely related to me.",1,How I Met Your Mother,101,19
6151,Barney,20," Lil, you know I can't promise that.",1,How I Met Your Mother,36,7
6154,Marshall,20," Shh! Shh! Look how cute she looks. All tuckered out. Hey, babe. Hey, little one. Hey, Lilypad.",1,How I Met Your Mother,95,17
6155,Lily,20, Crap! Band! We forgot a band! It's just gonna be silence and then people chewing.,1,How I Met Your Mother,82,15
6156,Marshall,20," Shh! Shh! Baby, don't worry about it. I called The 88!",1,How I Met Your Mother,55,11
6157,Lily,20, Who?,1,How I Met Your Mother,5,1

6162,Lily,20," Look, I... I can't sign off on a band I've never even seen. We... we don't even know if they can play our song. They're... they're going to have to come over here and audition.",1,How I Met Your Mother,177,35
6163,Marshall,20," Baby, The 88 don't audition. They're, like, the Wiggles of wedding bands.",1,How I Met Your Mother,74,12
6164,Lily,20," Well, then... I have to say no.",1,How I Met Your Mother,32,7
6165,Marshall,20," Baby, they're only holding the date until Monday.",1,How I Met Your Mother,50,8

6171,Ted,20, Wow.,1,How I Met Your Mother,5,1

6185,Lily,20," Yes, we are. It's the only way.",1,How I Met Your Mother,32,7
6186,Ted,20," You're getting on board with Barney's idea? Man, you really have snapped.",1,How I Met Your Mother,74,12
6187,Lily,20," It's nine weeks till the wedding. At this point, I'd say yes to just about anything.",1,How I Met Your Mother,85,16
6188,Barney,20, Well...,1,How I Met Your Mother,8,1
6189,Lily,20," No, Barney.",1,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
6192,Robin,20, I'll go with you.,1,How I Met Your Mother,18,4
6193,Lily,20, Really?,1,How I Met Your Mother,8,1
6194,Robin,20, Yeah. I never got to go to my prom. We always had field hockey nationals in the spring.,1,How I Met Your Mother,88,18
6195,Barney,20, Lesbian.,1,How I Met Your Mother,9,1
6196,Robin,20," The cough is supposed to cover the ""lesbian.""",1,How I Met Your Mother,46,8
6197,Barney,20," No, I'm trying to start a thing where the cough is separate.",1,How I Met Your Mother,61,12
6198,Lily,20, Do you think we look young enough to blend in at a high school?,1,How I Met Your Mother,64,14
6199,Barney,20," Please, I'm ageless, Scherbotsky just needs a good night's sleep, and you've got ""statutory"" written all over your body.",1,How I Met Your Mother,121,19
6200,Ted,20," Hey, why don't we all go?",1,How I Met Your Mother,26,6
6201,Robin,20, I don't know-- more people might be harder to sneak in. We don't want to mess things up for Lily.,1,How I Met Your Mother,98,20
6202,Ted,20," Yeah, you're right. Besides, Marshall and I have been planning on having a guy's night out before the wedding. Why don't we just make it tomorrow night?",1,How I Met Your Mother,153,27
6203,Marshall,20, Sounds awesome. We should go out and just get freakin' weird.,1,How I Met Your Mother,62,11
6204,Ted,20, Yeah.,1,How I Met Your Mother,6,1

6208,Lily,20," All right, what do you think?",1,How I Met Your Mother,30,6
6209,Barney,20, Horrible.,1,How I Met Your Mother,10,1
6210,Lily,20, You're gonna make such a great dad.,1,How I Met Your Mother,36,7
6211,Barney,20," You look so classy and nice. You're going to stick out like a sore thumb. Have you seen how the kids are dressing these days, with the Ashlee and the Lindsay and the Paris? They all dress like strippers. It's go ho or go home.",1,How I Met Your Mother,227,45
6212,Lily,20," Well, we have to get in. I have to see this band, 'cause we have to make a decision by Monday, 'cause I'm getting married in 71 days, and we still don't have...",1,How I Met Your Mother,161,33
6213,Robin,20," Shh. Sweetie, just focus on one thing at a time, okay? Right now, you just have to dress like a whore and that's it.",1,How I Met Your Mother,117,24
6214,Lily,20, All right.,1,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
6215,Barney,20," That's the spirit. Now, ladies, slut up!",1,How I Met Your Mother,41,7
6217,Robin,20," I never thought this would be a bad thing, but my wardrobe just isn't slutty enough.",1,How I Met Your Mother,85,16
6218,Lily,20, I didn't know I still had this.,1,How I Met Your Mother,32,7
6219,Robin,20, What?,1,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
6220,Lily,20, The dress I wore to my actual prom.,1,How I Met Your Mother,36,8
6223,Lily,20," Aw, you look great, too, Scooter.",1,How I Met Your Mother,34,6
6225,Lily,20," Oh, disco! I am so happy for you.",1,How I Met Your Mother,34,8
6227,Lily,20," Scooter, you're gonna be an umpire someday.",1,How I Met Your Mother,44,7
6230,Barney,20," Nice. You ladies look good, but your outfits are missing just one thing.",1,How I Met Your Mother,73,13
6231,Robin,20," No, Barney, this is as far as we're going to go. I'm not showing anymore...",1,How I Met Your Mother,76,15
6232,Barney,20, Two beautiful flowers for two beautiful flowers.,1,How I Met Your Mother,49,7
6233,Lily,20, Aw. Sweet. Thank you.,1,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
6234,Barney,20," Oh, Robin, are you tearing up?",1,How I Met Your Mother,31,6
6235,Robin,20," No. I've never been to prom before, okay?",1,How I Met Your Mother,42,8
6236,Lily,20, We got to go. See ya.,1,How I Met Your Mother,22,6
6237,Ted,20," Bye, have fun. See you.",1,How I Met Your Mother,24,5

6240,Ted,20," So, what, we ready for tonight?",1,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
6241,Marshall,20, Yeah. Just one thing we got to do first.,1,How I Met Your Mother,41,9
6242,Ted,20, Shot of Jim Beam?,1,How I Met Your Mother,18,4
6243,Marshall,20, Yeah.,1,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
6244,Ted,20, Yes!,1,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
6245,Marshall,20, And then I promised Lily that we'd stuff 200 wedding invitations.,1,How I Met Your Mother,66,11
6246,Ted,20, What?!,1,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
6247,Marshall,20," I'm sorry, dude, but you saw how stressed out she is.",1,How I Met Your Mother,54,11
6248,Ted,20," Come on! You've been doing wedding stuff nonstop. Take a break. Once you're married, if we go out and you get so drunk you throw up, it'll be sad, but if we do it tonight... it'll be less sad.",1,How I Met Your Mother,193,39
6249,Marshall,20," Okay, it'll be cool-- I'll tell you what. We'll make a game out of it. First one to stuff a hundred invitations gets a big prize.",1,How I Met Your Mother,130,26
6250,Ted,20," Do I look like I'm four? All right, what kind of prize are we talking?",1,How I Met Your Mother,71,15
6253,Lily,20," Wow, a lot more security than when we were kids.",1,How I Met Your Mother,49,10
6254,Robin,20, Is this gonna work?,1,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
6255,Lily,20," Yeah. Look, when I was 17, I used to sneak into clubs all the time. It's all about confidence. Follow me. Whee-hoo! Happy prom, everybody. Going to prom-- whee-hoo!",1,How I Met Your Mother,165,29
6257,Lily,20," Okay, bye. Okay, look, I just need to see the band. I'm getting married in two months, and...",1,How I Met Your Mother,94,18
6259,Barney,20," Hey, ho, hey!",1,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
6261,Lily,20," Wow. ""Ma'am?"" Check and mate.",1,How I Met Your Mother,30,5
6262,Barney,20," It's cool. Time to activate plan B. Scherbotsky, how comfortable are you with a crossbow? Scherbotsky?",1,How I Met Your Mother,103,16
6263,Robin,20," Hey, guys. Do you want to take two hot girls to prom?",1,How I Met Your Mother,54,12
6265,Robin,20, For free.,1,How I Met Your Mother,10,2
6267,Robin,20," Great. I'm Robin, this is my friend Lily.",1,How I Met Your Mother,42,8
6268,Lily,20, Hi. Shall we?,1,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
6270,Robin,20," Oh, hey, wait. How's Barney getting in?",1,How I Met Your Mother,40,7
6271,Barney,20, Don't worry about me. I'll get in. Oh... I'll get in.,1,How I Met Your Mother,54,11
6273,Lily,20, We're in!,1,How I Met Your Mother,10,2
6275,Lily,20," Oh, you're kidding me.",1,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
6277,Robin,20," Yeah, what the hell? It's prom. That tastes like cough syrup.",1,How I Met Your Mother,62,11
6279,Robin,20," Nerds who aren't good at math? Life's going to be rough, boys.",1,How I Met Your Mother,63,12
6280,Lily,20," Hi. Excuse me. I was wondering if you guys could play ""Good Feeling"" by the Violent Femmes. I know it's probably not in your repertoire, but I'm getting married and my fiancí© wants to hire you guys as the band, but I can't sign off on it until I hear you play ""Good Feeling"" because that's our song, and what kind of wedding band would you be if you couldn't play our song, right? Right?",1,How I Met Your Mother,389,75
6283,Robin,20, My phlegm feels looser.,1,How I Met Your Mother,24,4
6285,Ted,20," This is pathetic. It's guys' night. We should be out in a bar getting in fights. If I got in a fight, would you have my back?",1,How I Met Your Mother,126,27
6286,Marshall,20, You know it.,1,How I Met Your Mother,13,3
6287,Ted,20," I'd have your back, too.",1,How I Met Your Mother,25,5
6288,Marshall,20, That's cool.,1,How I Met Your Mother,13,2
6289,Ted,20," What, you don't think you'd need my help? You don't know what I can do. I'm like... like a berserker.",1,How I Met Your Mother,102,20
6290,Marshall,20," Okay, Ted.  Hello.",1,How I Met Your Mother,19,3
6291,Robin,20," Hey, it's Robin. Um, Lily needs you to download the sheet music for ""Good Feeling"" and bring it out here, like, now.",1,How I Met Your Mother,117,22
6292,Marshall,20, Hang on. It's Robin. She wants me to go to prom. Can Ted come?,1,How I Met Your Mother,63,14
6293,Ted,20, Wait! Don't ask! That's so lame! I don't even want to go anyway.,1,How I Met Your Mother,65,13
6294,Robin,20," Uh, I don't know. Things have been so weird between us.",1,How I Met Your Mother,56,11
6295,Ted,20, What'd she say? What'd she say?,1,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
6296,Robin,20," He lied and told me he broke up with his girlfriend to try to hook up with me. I mean, I know he apologized for it but it's just, it's not easy to forgive. Look, if you absolutely must bring Ted, it's, it's not like I'm going to claw my own eyes out if he comes.",1,How I Met Your Mother,263,56
6297,Marshall,20," Okay, bye. She totally wants you to come.",1,How I Met Your Mother,42,8
6299,Robin,20," All right, sheet music's on the way. Are you okay?",1,How I Met Your Mother,51,10
6300,Lily,20, There's just so much to do for this wedding. My head is swirling. It's just all moving too fast.,1,How I Met Your Mother,97,19
6303,Lily,20, I just... I just don't want everything in my life to be decided already.,1,How I Met Your Mother,73,14
6305,Lily,20," Scooter, when I go off to college, that's the end for us.",1,How I Met Your Mother,58,12
6307,Lily,20," There's still so much I want to do. I want to travel, live overseas as an artist, maybe have a lesbian relationship. Plus, I think I was just dating you 'cause you look a little bit like Kurt Cobain.",1,How I Met Your Mother,200,39
6309,Lily,20, Please don't put that kind of pressure on me! It's too much!,1,How I Met Your Mother,61,12
6312,Lily,20, What?,1,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
6313,Robin,20," Well, we did promise them one dance.",1,How I Met Your Mother,37,7
6314,Lily,20," Yeah, sure, okay. So Andrew, what's your big plan? What's life going to be like after tonight?",1,How I Met Your Mother,95,17
6316,Lily,20," No, you won't.",1,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
6318,Lily,20," No, you won't accomplish anything you set out to. You'll get a girlfriend the first day of college and you'll give up your independence and you'll never live abroad and you'll wind up old before your time wondering ""Whatever happened to my hopes and my dreams?""",1,How I Met Your Mother,262,46
6321,Robin,20," Oh, Sean, look, um, you're a nice guy, but I just don't... No, you're not getting lucky tonight.",1,How I Met Your Mother,97,18
6323,Ted,20, Okay.,1,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
6325,Marshall,20," What's it to you, giant turtle?",1,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
6327,Marshall,20," Oh, hey. Where's Lily?",1,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
6328,Barney,20, She's in the bathroom.,1,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
6329,Marshall,20," Wait here, I should go talk to the band.",1,How I Met Your Mother,41,9
6330,Ted,20, All right.,1,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
6331,Barney,20, How did you guys get in here?,1,How I Met Your Mother,30,7
6332,Ted,20, We just snuck in the back.,1,How I Met Your Mother,27,6
6333,Barney,20, You just snu... Are you serious? I've been trying to get in here all night. I finally paid a janitor 200 bucks to let me borrow this mascot costume.,1,How I Met Your Mother,149,29
6334,Ted,20, But you got in. Slow and steady won the race.,1,How I Met Your Mother,46,10
6335,Marshall,20," Hey, bro, have you seen my fiancí©e Lily?",1,How I Met Your Mother,42,8
6337,Marshall,20," Listen, little buddy, I understand it's prom and the adrenaline's pumping, but...",1,How I Met Your Mother,82,12
6339,Marshall,20," Whoa, whoa. Look, let's not get carried away.",1,How I Met Your Mother,46,8
6341,Lily,20, I can't believe I unloaded like that on a high school senior.,1,How I Met Your Mother,62,12
6342,Robin,20," I can't believe a high school senior unloaded like that on me. I'm going to ask you something and, um, maybe it's crazy 'cause you guys are the cutest couple ever. But, um, are you having second thoughts?",1,How I Met Your Mother,205,38
6343,Lily,20, Yeah. But not about Marshall. About me. I just keep thinking about the girl I was ten years ago and wondering what happened to her.,1,How I Met Your Mother,132,25
6345,Lily,20," I don't want to be tied down. I want to live in France and Spain and Italy and just soak up life and put it on a canvas, even if it means being a waitress in crappy cafí©s for five years, I don't care. I'm going to be a painter. And I can't do any of that with a, with a boyfriend shackled around my neck, you know? But anyway, I'm blabbering. Way to make new friends, Lily. I'm sorry. What was your name again?",1,How I Met Your Mother,412,85
6347,Lily,20," Nice to meet you, Marshall. Guess we're hallmates.",1,How I Met Your Mother,51,8
6348,Marshall,20, Yeah.,1,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
6349,Lily,20, It works.,1,How I Met Your Mother,10,2
6350,Marshall,20, Violent Femmes. I love this song.,1,How I Met Your Mother,34,6
6351,Lily,20," Me, too.",1,How I Met Your Mother,9,2
6353,Lily,20," I didn't have any of the experiences I set out to. The travel, the bohemian art life, my big lesbian experience. I didn't do any of it.",1,How I Met Your Mother,136,27
6354,Robin,20," Lily, you're marrying your best friend in the world. I mean, isn't that worth all the other experiences combined?",1,How I Met Your Mother,114,19
6355,Lily,20, Yeah.,1,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
6356,Robin,20," And look, you can still travel, I mean, you can still paint. And as far as your lesbian experience... Happy?",1,How I Met Your Mother,109,20
6357,Lily,20," Yeah. So field hockey, huh?",1,How I Met Your Mother,28,5
6358,Robin,20, Shut up.,1,How I Met Your Mother,9,2
6362,Ted,20," Oh, come on-- you're the one who let in a kid with nunchakus. You call yourself security guards? I was just defending my boy here.",1,How I Met Your Mother,131,25
6363,Marshall,20, I totally could have taken that kid.,1,How I Met Your Mother,37,7
6364,Ted,20," Uh, yeah, and I totally had your back, so...",1,How I Met Your Mother,45,9
6365,Marshall,20," Well, I don't need it, but thanks.",1,How I Met Your Mother,35,7
6366,Ted,20," Uh, yeah, you did, and you're welcome.",1,How I Met Your Mother,39,7
6367,Marshall,20," No, the kid was totally, like, a white belt and I'm gigantic. Listen, guys, I'm sorry. Please, I just need to get in there for one more song.",1,How I Met Your Mother,142,28
6369,Barney,20," You guys will thank me for this later, okay? Listen, Don, Ray, can't we all...?",1,How I Met Your Mother,80,15
6372,Ted,20," You know, for a turtle, he's surprisingly quick.",1,How I Met Your Mother,49,8
6374,Ted,20, So how was your first prom?,1,How I Met Your Mother,28,6
6375,Robin,20," You tell me. I hated my dress, my date got wasted and puked on me, there was a huge fight and I kissed a girl.",1,How I Met Your Mother,111,25
6376,Ted,20," So, basically, it was a prom.",1,How I Met Your Mother,30,6
6377,Robin,20," Okay, I've missed you. Not in a we're-going-to-make-out way, not even in an I-forgive-you way. Just in a I've-missed-you way.",1,How I Met Your Mother,126,20
6378,Ted,20, I'll take what I can get.,1,How I Met Your Mother,26,6
6379,Barney,20," And that, my friends, is why you don't get your money's worth when you wear jeans to a strip club.",1,How I Met Your Mother,99,20
6380,Marshall,20," So you got to admit, The 88 are rocking our song.",1,How I Met Your Mother,50,11
6381,Lily,20," Yeah, it's good.",1,How I Met Your Mother,17,3
6382,Marshall,20," Band? Check. Two months, baby. Two months.",1,How I Met Your Mother,43,7
6383,Lily,20, Two months.,1,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
6387,Ted,21, Thank you.,1,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
6389,Ted,21," 'Kay. Oh, go on, touch it.",1,How I Met Your Mother,27,6
6390,Lily,21," Ah! Sweet damn, that's a hot plate.",1,How I Met Your Mother,36,7
6391,Ted,21," All right, so, Barney, are you doing this or what?",1,How I Met Your Mother,51,10
6392,Robin,21," Oh, geez, Barney, don't do this.",1,How I Met Your Mother,33,6
6393,Barney,21," I have to, it's my birthday present to Ted.",1,How I Met Your Mother,44,9
6394,Marshall,21," You don't have to. Please, it's going to be embarrassing and we're going to have to stop coming here, which will suck... in addition to probably being kind of healthy.",1,How I Met Your Mother,168,30
6395,Ted,21," Come on, Marshall, it's the greatest pickup line of all time. Barney.",1,How I Met Your Mother,70,12
6396,Marshall,21," Oy, gevalt.",1,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
6397,Barney,21," Ah... Happy birthday, Ted.",1,How I Met Your Mother,27,4
6398,Ted,21, Whoo-hoo!,1,How I Met Your Mother,10,1
6400,Barney,21," Uh, excuse me, has anyone ever told y... Oh, my God.",1,How I Met Your Mother,53,11
6402,Barney,21, Oh! Call an ambulance!,1,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
6404,Barney,21," Try not to speak. Here, sit down. Just don't talk, don't talk.",1,How I Met Your Mother,63,12
6406,Barney,21," I'm serious, call 911.",1,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
6408,Barney,21," Shh! Shh! Just don't move. Don't move. Just try... Here, have some water. Water! Here, drink this. Shh! Shh!",1,How I Met Your Mother,109,19
6409,Robin,21," You know, the more I watch this, the less convinced I am that it's the greatest pickup line of all time.",1,How I Met Your Mother,105,21
6410,Ted,21, Wait for it.,1,How I Met Your Mother,13,3
6411,Lily,21," 28. Two more 'til the big one, three-oh.",1,How I Met Your Mother,41,8
6413,Lily,21," Still, you know, another year older. Still single. You don't hear your Tedological clock ticking?",1,How I Met Your Mother,98,15
6414,Ted,21, Nope. I hit the snooze button.,1,How I Met Your Mother,31,6
6415,Robin,21, And here come the paramedics.,1,How I Met Your Mother,30,5
6416,Barney,21," Oh, thank God, you're here.",1,How I Met Your Mother,28,5
6418,Barney,21, I think there might be some internal bleeding. Probably some fractures. We got to get her to the hospital.,1,How I Met Your Mother,107,19
6420,Barney,21, You've had a terrible fall.,1,How I Met Your Mother,28,5
6422,Barney,21, Really? 'Cause I could swear you fell straight out of heaven. Angel... Give him your number. What? Give him your number. What?,1,How I Met Your Mother,127,22
6424,Barney,21," Come on, guys, you're embarrassing me.",1,How I Met Your Mother,39,6
6426,Barney,21, What are you...? Come on. They're not going to stop 'til you give me your number.,1,How I Met Your Mother,82,16
6428,Barney,21, It works!,1,How I Met Your Mother,10,2
6429,Marshall,21, I cannot believe that she gave him her number.,1,How I Met Your Mother,47,9
6430,Robin,21, Maybe she really does have a brain injury.,1,How I Met Your Mother,43,8
6431,Barney,21," Thank you, everyone. Thank you, everyone. It's been fun. It's Wendy the waitress. Tip her well. Thanks a lot, guys. Troilus and Cressida. Neighborhood Playhouse. Check them out, they're good.",1,How I Met Your Mother,192,30
6432,Ted,21," I realize why I'm still single. I'm picky. I'm not going to settle. If I'm going to marry someone, she has to be perfect.",1,How I Met Your Mother,122,24
6433,Lily,21," Well, what's perfect?",1,How I Met Your Mother,22,3
6434,Ted,21, It's not like I have a list.,1,How I Met Your Mother,29,7
6435,Robin,21," Oh, yes, you do.",1,How I Met Your Mother,17,4
6436,Ted,21," Attractive, college-educated, she wants two kids-- a boy and a girl...",1,How I Met Your Mother,71,11
6437,Lily,21, That's not hard. I know at least...,1,How I Met Your Mother,36,7
6438,Ted,21," I'm not done. She likes dogs, Otis Redding, does the crossword. She's into sports, but not so much so that her legs are, like, more muscular than mine. That weirds me out. And she plays bass guitar like Kim Deal from the Pixies.",1,How I Met Your Mother,229,43
6439,Marshall,21, Or Kim Gordon from Sonic Youth.,1,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
6440,Ted,21," Any Kim from any cool band, really. Can't be too picky.",1,How I Met Your Mother,56,11
6441,Lily,21, You're never going to find this girl.,1,How I Met Your Mother,38,7
6442,Ted,21, Exactly. So I'm just going to wait for her to come to me. I am done trying to plan the unplannable.,1,How I Met Your Mother,100,21
6443,Marshall,21," So, what, you think fate's just going to take care of it?",1,How I Met Your Mother,58,12
6444,Ted,21, That's the plan.,1,How I Met Your Mother,17,3
6447,Ted,21," Whoa, you're up early.",1,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
6448,Lily,21," Yeah, thought I'd whip up some pancakes.",1,How I Met Your Mother,41,7
6449,Ted,21, Does Marshall know?,1,How I Met Your Mother,20,3
6450,Lily,21, He's still sound asleep.,1,How I Met Your Mother,25,4
6451,Marshall,21," Awesome. So awesome. God! Best girl ever. Screw these pancakes, I should cover you in syrup and gobble you up.",1,How I Met Your Mother,111,20
6452,Ted,21," Please don't do that. Hey, is this milk any good?",1,How I Met Your Mother,50,10
6453,Marshall,21," Oh, yeah, that totally got me yesterday.",1,How I Met Your Mother,41,7
6454,Ted,21," God, why didn't you throw it away?",1,How I Met Your Mother,35,7
6455,Lily,21, I'm going shopping after work. I'll pick up some milk.,1,How I Met Your Mother,55,10
6456,Marshall,21, Oh...! These pancakes are delightful.,1,How I Met Your Mother,38,5
6457,Lily,21," What's wrong, baby?",1,How I Met Your Mother,20,3
6458,Marshall,21, This is the high point of my day.,1,How I Met Your Mother,34,8
6461,Marshall,21," Hey, Barney, I had some questions about filling out these requisition forms.",1,How I Met Your Mother,77,12
6462,Barney,21, Binoculars. Second pair on my desk.,1,How I Met Your Mother,36,6
6463,Marshall,21," I don't have time to be creepy, dude. I have a lot of work to do.",1,How I Met Your Mother,66,16
6464,Barney,21," Just take a look, will ya? Okay, corner office. Top floor. Check out that guy. Name's Clark Butterfield. He works over at Nicholson, Hewitt and West and every morning, he orders a sandwich from the deli downstairs.",1,How I Met Your Mother,215,37
6465,Marshall,21, So?,1,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
6466,Barney,21," So guess what I did to that sandwich? Here, I took a picture.",1,How I Met Your Mother,62,13
6467,Marshall,21, Oh! Sweet Lord.,1,How I Met Your Mother,16,3
6468,Barney,21, And now I'm e-mailing said picture to him.,1,How I Met Your Mother,43,8
6469,Marshall,21, Ooh! Duck! That is sick! Why would you do that?,1,How I Met Your Mother,48,10
6470,Barney,21, Who knows? This feud goes so far back I can't remember who fired the first shot.,1,How I Met Your Mother,81,16
6471,Marshall,21, You?,1,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
6472,Barney,21," Totally. Well, look, if you would just... help me fill out these forms, that would be great.",1,How I Met Your Mother,93,17
6473,Marshall,21, What?,1,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
6474,Barney,21," Butterfield is going to retaliate within the next four hours. That's been his pattern. This is war, Eriksen. I need you to clear your schedule, call Lily, tell her you'll be home late.",1,How I Met Your Mother,185,33
6475,Marshall,21, This is stupid.,1,How I Met Your Mother,16,3
6476,Barney,21," Stu... Come on, man, I didn't recruit you to work here for your lawyering skills. I recruited you to be my executive mischief consultant.",1,How I Met Your Mother,138,24
6477,Marshall,21," This is a job for me, Barney. It's a way to make some extra wedding money, and that's it. Now I'm sorry, but I have work to do.",1,How I Met Your Mother,128,28
6478,Barney,21," Tracy, could you come in here, please? Would you please inform Mr. Eriksen that I'm no longer speaking to him.",1,How I Met Your Mother,111,20
6480,Marshall,21," I get it. Thank you, Tracy.",1,How I Met Your Mother,28,6
6482,Ted,21, Hello?,1,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
6484,Ted,21, Speaking.,1,How I Met Your Mother,10,1
6486,Ted,21," Uh, yeah. You guys never found me a match.",1,How I Met Your Mother,43,9
6489,Ted,21, I don't understand. What happened to Ellen Pierce? Doesn't she run this place?,1,How I Met Your Mother,79,13
6491,Ted,21, So I'm in good hands. You found me a match?,1,How I Met Your Mother,44,10
6493,Ted,21," No way. The last time I did this, the girl turned out to be engaged.",1,How I Met Your Mother,69,15
6496,Ted,21," All right, fine. Set it up.",1,How I Met Your Mother,28,6
6498,Marshall,21," You wanted to see me, so I guess that means we're talking again?",1,How I Met Your Mother,65,13
6499,Barney,21, Will you taste this latte for me? I think they gave me decaf.,1,How I Met Your Mother,62,13
6500,Marshall,21, Tastes normal to me.,1,How I Met Your Mother,21,4
6501,Barney,21," That's what I thought, too. Then I got this e-mail from Butterfield.",1,How I Met Your Mother,69,12
6502,Marshall,21," Oh, God!",1,How I Met Your Mother,9,2
6503,Barney,21, It got me as well.,1,How I Met Your Mother,19,5
6504,Marshall,21," Well, then why did you have me drink it?!",1,How I Met Your Mother,42,9
6505,Barney,21, Because now... you're in.,1,How I Met Your Mother,26,4
6506,Marshall,21, Okay. Don't think I'm overlooking the obvious fact that I should just be mad at you. But Executive Mischief Consultant Marshall Eriksen reporting for duty. Let's make that b*st*rd pay. You think that we should brush our teeth first?,1,How I Met Your Mother,233,39
6507,Barney,21," Yeah, it's probably a good idea.",1,How I Met Your Mother,33,6
6511,Ted,21, Lily?,1,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
6512,Lily,21," Hey, Ted, are you busy?",1,How I Met Your Mother,24,5
6513,Ted,21, Um... yes.,1,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
6514,Lily,21," Oh, right. Soul mate. Forgot. Listen, could you take a cab out to Duchess County and change a flat on Marshall's Fiero?",1,How I Met Your Mother,120,22
6515,Ted,21, What? What? No. Can't you just call Marshall?,1,How I Met Your Mother,46,8
6516,Lily,21," Marshall can't know about this. Look, Ted, it's dark, I don't know how to change a tire, and I've stumbled into the beginning of a very scary campfire story. Can you please hurry?",1,How I Met Your Mother,180,33
6517,Ted,21," I can't, I'm waiting...",1,How I Met Your Mother,24,4
6518,Lily,21," Oh, my God, is that a drifter with a hook for a hand? No, drifter, no!",1,How I Met Your Mother,71,16
6519,Ted,21," Come on, Lily.",1,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
6520,Lily,21, But you see my point.,1,How I Met Your Mother,22,5
6521,Ted,21," All right, stay there. I'm on my way.",1,How I Met Your Mother,38,8
6524,Lily,21," Oh, thank God. I'm so sorry about this. Did you get ahold of your date?",1,How I Met Your Mother,72,15
6525,Ted,21, Yes.,1,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
6526,Lily,21, And was she okay about pushing it back?,1,How I Met Your Mother,40,8
6527,Ted,21, Yes. Because she's perfect. So what am I doing here?,1,How I Met Your Mother,53,10
6528,Lily,21, You can never tell Marshall.,1,How I Met Your Mother,29,5
6529,Ted,21, I won't.,1,How I Met Your Mother,9,2
6530,Lily,21, Ever. Swear. Swear on the lives of your unborn boy and girl.,1,How I Met Your Mother,61,12
6531,Ted,21, I swear on Luke and Leia.,1,How I Met Your Mother,26,6
6532,Lily,21," About a month ago, I started getting insomnia. Marrying Marshall had been all I wanted for a long time. But, now that it was really happening, it seemed kind of huge and scary.",1,How I Met Your Mother,177,33
6533,Ted,21, Did you talk to Marshall about it?,1,How I Met Your Mother,35,7
6534,Lily,21," He wouldn't have understood. He's not exactly nervous about tying the knot. So I spent my nights reading, painting, setting the high score on Super Bomber Man...",1,How I Met Your Mother,162,27
6535,Ted,21, That was you? Awesome!,1,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
6536,Lily,21," I know! I just got in the zone and... Not the point of the story. And then I started thinking about Victoria and how she followed her dream to Germany, and I found that art fellowship.",1,How I Met Your Mother,185,36
6537,Ted,21, Let me guess. It's somewhere far away.,1,How I Met Your Mother,39,7
6538,Lily,21," San Francisco. But it's not like I'm going to do it. The dates conflict with the wedding. But I love painting, and I've always wondered if I'm any good. This was a way to find out. And the interview is tonight. In New Haven.",1,How I Met Your Mother,225,44
6539,Ted,21, You don't want to get married.,1,How I Met Your Mother,31,6
6540,Lily,21, Of course I want to get married. I... It's not like I was ever going to do it. I just... I just really wanted to see if I could get this.,1,How I Met Your Mother,138,31
6541,Ted,21," Lily, we live in the center of art and culture in America. I'm sure you could find a program here that's just as selective. But you chose one in a city 3,000 miles away, and you didn't tell Marshall. I think it's pretty clear what that means.",1,How I Met Your Mother,243,47
6542,Lily,21," Okay, I was... I was having second thoughts. But I'm not any more. I... I mean, this flat tire was a sign. I'm not supposed to do this. I'm supposed to go home and-and be with Marshall. You must think I'm so stupid.",1,How I Met Your Mother,216,43
6543,Ted,21, I don't think you're stupid.,1,How I Met Your Mother,29,5
6544,Lily,21, I love Marshall.,1,How I Met Your Mother,17,3
6545,Ted,21, I know you do. Come here. It's okay. Look... Marriage is big. You're allowed to freak out.,1,How I Met Your Mother,91,17
6546,Lily,21, But why am I the only one? How come Marshall isn't doing anything crazy?,1,How I Met Your Mother,73,14
6549,Marshall,21, So all we need is one large shipping box and 100 white mice.,1,How I Met Your Mother,61,13
6551,Ted,21, All done.,1,How I Met Your Mother,10,2
6552,Lily,21," Ted, let's go to New Haven.",1,How I Met Your Mother,28,6
6553,Ted,21," Lily, don't do this to yourself.",1,How I Met Your Mother,33,6
6554,Lily,21," I just need to know if I can get in. If I do this interview, and get into the program, then I'll know, and I can forget all about it, and get married. Come on! It's an adventure.",1,How I Met Your Mother,179,38
6555,Ted,21," No, it's not an adventure. It's a mistake.",1,How I Met Your Mother,43,8
6556,Lily,21," Okay, yes, it's a mistake. I know it's a mistake. But there are certain things in life where you know it's a mistake but you don't really know it's a mistake because the only way to really know it's a mistake is to make the mistake, and look back, and say, ""Yep. That was a mistake."" So, really, the bigger mistake would be to not make the mistake, because then you go your whole life not really knowing if something is a mistake or not. And, damn it, I've made no mistakes! I've done all of this-- my life, my relationship, my career-- mistake-free. Does any of this make sense to you?",1,How I Met Your Mother,587,112
6557,Ted,21," I don't know. You said ""mistake"" a lot. Lily, don't do this.",1,How I Met Your Mother,61,12
6558,Lily,21," Ted, I'm getting married in two months, and I'm freaking out, and you're my best friend, and you just have to forgive me for this.",1,How I Met Your Mother,131,25
6559,Ted,21," Forgive you for what?  Lily. Lily! Hey, Lily, this is Ted, the guy you left stranded by the side of the road. I just wanted to say good luck with the interview, remember to pick up some milk... Oh, and, when I get home, I'm going to kill you. And, also, I texted you the same thing.  Hey, I need a big favor.",1,How I Met Your Mother,309,63
6560,Barney,21," Anything, bro.",1,How I Met Your Mother,15,2
6561,Ted,21, I need you to come up to Duchess County and pick me up.,1,How I Met Your Mother,56,13
6562,Barney,21, No.,1,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
6563,Ted,21, It's kind of an emergency.,1,How I Met Your Mother,27,5
6564,Barney,21, What are you doing in Duchess County?,1,How I Met Your Mother,38,7
6565,Ted,21, Apple picking. Can you just get up here?,1,How I Met Your Mother,41,8
6566,Barney,21," I wish I could help, buddy, but I'm stuck here at work. We're kind of swamped.",1,How I Met Your Mother,79,16
6567,Marshall,21, Is that Ted?,1,How I Met Your Mother,13,3
6568,Barney,21, Yeah. He's stuck in Duchess County.,1,How I Met Your Mother,36,6
6569,Marshall,21, Don't you have a big date tonight?,1,How I Met Your Mother,35,7
6570,Ted,21," Uh... Marshall. Hi. Yes. Yes, I do.",1,How I Met Your Mother,36,7
6571,Marshall,21, So what are you doing in Duchess County?,1,How I Met Your Mother,41,8
6572,Ted,21, Can't a brother go apple picking without getting the third degree? Damn!,1,How I Met Your Mother,73,12
6573,Marshall,21," Okay, well, hang on. I'm coming to get you.",1,How I Met Your Mother,44,9
6574,Ted,21, No!,1,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
6575,Marshall,21," Relax, man. I'll take the Fiero.",1,How I Met Your Mother,33,6
6576,Ted,21," No, no, no. Just... forget it. Ha, ha! A little prank. I'm not in Duchess County.",1,How I Met Your Mother,82,16
6577,Marshall,21, So that's the prank? That you're not in Duchess County?,1,How I Met Your Mother,56,10
6578,Ted,21, Yep. Gotcha! Classic! Gotta go.,1,How I Met Your Mother,32,5
6580,Barney,21," Hey, check out this one. It actually looks like Butterfield.",1,How I Met Your Mother,61,10
6581,Marshall,21," You know, over at the NRDC, it's a bunch of really committed people who take their job of saving the earth very, very seriously. Which is great, and everything, but I can't imagine having this much fun over there.",1,How I Met Your Mother,214,39
6582,Barney,21, You thinking about coming to work here full-time?,1,How I Met Your Mother,50,8
6583,Marshall,21," Maybe. Don't tell Lily, okay?",1,How I Met Your Mother,30,5
6585,Barney,21," Thanks, Tracy.",1,How I Met Your Mother,15,2
6587,Barney,21, Of course we are. Were you going to think of that?,1,How I Met Your Mother,51,11
6588,Marshall,21, No.,1,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
6589,Barney,21, That would have been bad.,1,How I Met Your Mother,26,5
6590,Marshall,21, Horrible.,1,How I Met Your Mother,10,1
6593,Robin,21," Need a ride, cowboy?",1,How I Met Your Mother,21,4
6594,Ted,21, Sorry. I don't get in vans with strangers.,1,How I Met Your Mother,43,8
6595,Robin,21," Hmm, too bad. I got candy.",1,How I Met Your Mother,27,6
6596,Ted,21, Candy?!,1,How I Met Your Mother,8,1
6597,Robin,21, So you're not going to tell me what you were doing by the side of a highway in Duchess County?,1,How I Met Your Mother,95,20
6598,Ted,21, Nope. Sworn to secrecy.,1,How I Met Your Mother,24,4
6599,Robin,21," Oh, come on.",1,How I Met Your Mother,13,3
6600,Ted,21, I like your hat.,1,How I Met Your Mother,17,4
6601,Robin,21, Right. This is embarrassing. I got highlights.,1,How I Met Your Mother,47,7
6602,Ted,21," Oh, for the waiting room of your dental practice? Highlights is a children's magazine.",1,How I Met Your Mother,87,14
6603,Robin,21," Yeah, I got it. I thought it might look cool. Of course my colorist took ""highlights"" to mean, ""I want to look like a tiger,"" hence the hat.",1,How I Met Your Mother,141,28
6604,Ted,21, Oh. I gotta see this.,1,How I Met Your Mother,22,5
6605,Robin,21, No way.,1,How I Met Your Mother,8,2
6606,Ted,21, Please. I bet it doesn't look that bad. I bet it looks grr-eat!,1,How I Met Your Mother,64,13
6607,Robin,21," So, she says, changing the subject. Big date tonight. How does she rate on the Mosby checklist?",1,How I Met Your Mother,96,17
6608,Ted,21," Kind of amazingly. Uh, she's 28, like me.",1,How I Met Your Mother,42,8
6609,Robin,21," Wow, I'm 28. Hmm.",1,How I Met Your Mother,18,4
6610,Ted,21," Uh, college educated-- check. Plays tennis-- check. Uh, favorite book is Love in the Time of Cholera-- check.",1,How I Met Your Mother,110,18
6611,Robin,21," I read that. More like ""Love in the Time of Don't Bothera.""",1,How I Met Your Mother,60,12
6612,Ted,21," You know, it's very rude to wear a hat indoors. I'm just saying.",1,How I Met Your Mother,65,13
6613,Robin,21, We're not indoors. We're in a van.,1,How I Met Your Mother,35,7
6614,Ted,21, Vans have doors-- let me see your hair.,1,How I Met Your Mother,40,8
6615,Robin,21, Never. What else?,1,How I Met Your Mother,18,3
6616,Ted,21, She loves lasagna.,1,How I Met Your Mother,19,3
6617,Robin,21, Barf.,1,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
6618,Ted,21," You know, I am sensing a pattern here.",1,How I Met Your Mother,39,8
6619,Robin,21, What else?,1,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
6620,Ted,21," Let's see what else... Oh, she doesn't look like a tiger-- check.",1,How I Met Your Mother,66,12
6621,Robin,21, And she's looking to get married and have kids?,1,How I Met Your Mother,48,9
6622,Ted,21, Check and check. She wants two kids... a boy and a girl.,1,How I Met Your Mother,57,12
6623,Robin,21," Wow. You know, I've been thinking about this. I think I want to have zero kids.",1,How I Met Your Mother,80,16
6624,Ted,21, Really? You don't want kids?,1,How I Met Your Mother,29,5
6625,Robin,21," You know, Ted, not everyone is as much of a woman as you. Hey. I'm driving. Look at that. 8",1,How I Met Your Mother,92,20
6626,Ted,21," Hey, thanks for picking me up.",1,How I Met Your Mother,31,6
6627,Robin,21, Good luck on your date. I hope she's everything you're looking for.,1,How I Met Your Mother,68,12
6628,Ted,21, Thanks.,1,How I Met Your Mother,8,1
6629,Robin,21," All right, you've clearly had a rough night. I want you to go in there with a smile on your face, so, uh, here's what I'm going to do.",1,How I Met Your Mother,135,29
6630,Ted,21, You're going to show me your hair?,1,How I Met Your Mother,35,7
6631,Robin,21," Actually, I was going to show you my breasts, but... sure, we can do hair.",1,How I Met Your Mother,75,15
6632,Ted,21, You just made my night.,1,How I Met Your Mother,24,5
6633,Robin,21, Go.,1,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
6636,Marshall,21," Tomorrow morning, Barney's going to send out the package, and Butterfield's going to be knee-deep in angry white mice. Oh, hey, dude.",1,How I Met Your Mother,134,22
6637,Ted,21," Hey, guys.",1,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
6638,Lily,21, Hi.,1,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
6639,Ted,21," Hey. So, Lil, did you, uh, get the milk?",1,How I Met Your Mother,41,9
6640,Lily,21," Yeah. Yeah, I-I got it.",1,How I Met Your Mother,24,5
6641,Ted,21, You think you might want to... drink the milk?,1,How I Met Your Mother,47,9
6642,Lily,21," No. Nope, I'm good. I don't need any milk.",1,How I Met Your Mother,43,9
6643,Marshall,21," Look, guys, I know milk is important-- it's got vitamin A, vitamin D, it's a great way to start the morning-- but Ted just had a huge date. How'd it go, dude?",1,How I Met Your Mother,159,32
6644,Ted,21, I didn't go.,1,How I Met Your Mother,13,3
6645,Marshall,21, What? Why?,1,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
6646,Ted,21, I changed my mind. I don't want to meet her.,1,How I Met Your Mother,45,10
6647,Marshall,21, Why? She sounds perfect.,1,How I Met Your Mother,25,4
6648,Ted,21, I don't want perfect. I want Robin.,1,How I Met Your Mother,36,7
6649,Marshall,21," Oh, God, not this again. Ted, it's a mistake.",1,How I Met Your Mother,46,9
6650,Ted,21, Maybe. But it's a mistake I have to make.,1,How I Met Your Mother,42,9
6651,Marshall,21, Wrong. It's a mistake you don't have to make. Look at the evidence. You and Robin have tried this again and again...,1,How I Met Your Mother,117,22
6654,Lily,21," Ah, sweet damn, that's a hot plate.",1,How I Met Your Mother,36,7
6655,Ted,21," Hey, is this milk any good?",1,How I Met Your Mother,28,6
6660,Ted,22, So... what do you think?,1,How I Met Your Mother,25,5
6661,Barney,22," Robin again? Ted, the universe clearly does not want you and Robin to be together. Don't piss off the universe. The universe will slap you.",1,How I Met Your Mother,140,25
6662,Ted,22, But don't you think the universe has more important things to worry about than my dating life?,1,How I Met Your Mother,95,17
6663,Marshall,22, Unless your dating life is the glue holding the entire universe together... Whoa. Chills. Anybody else get chills?,1,How I Met Your Mother,115,18
6664,Ted,22," Look, I realize we've been down this road before, but the fact is, whatever I do, it all keeps coming back to Robin, so... I gotta do this.  Ow! What the hell?",1,How I Met Your Mother,160,32
6665,Barney,22, That wasn't me. That was the universe.,1,How I Met Your Mother,39,7
6669,Robin,22," Thanks, Lou. Boy, too bad. Our big Metro News One camping trip was going to be this weekend.",1,How I Met Your Mother,93,18
6671,Robin,22, Guess we'll have to take a rain check.,1,How I Met Your Mother,39,8
6673,Robin,22, Have a great night.,1,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
6676,Robin,22," Well, I'd give you the ""I don't date coworkers"" speech again, but, God, you must have that sum'bitch memorized by now.",1,How I Met Your Mother,119,21
6679,Marshall,22," Dude, he's right. How many times do you have to watch this crash and burn before you say, ""enough""?",1,How I Met Your Mother,100,19
6680,Ted,22," One more. One more time. One more big, beautiful, stupid romantic gesture. And then, whatever she says, yes or no, that's it. If it's yes, great. If it's no, then I am done going after Robin forever.",1,How I Met Your Mother,200,37
6681,Lily,22," So what's this big, beautiful romantic gesture?",1,How I Met Your Mother,48,7
6682,Ted,22," I am going to make her... a mix CD. No, I'm kidding. I got a plan. Lily, I'm going to need the spare key to Robin's apartment.",1,How I Met Your Mother,127,27
6683,Barney,22," I see where this is going. Ted, waiting naked in a girl's bed wearing whipped cream undies does not work... usually. The setting-- Martha's Vineyard, 1999. The characters",1,How I Met Your Mother,171,28
6685,Lily,22," Universe. So, this plan you speak of?",1,How I Met Your Mother,38,7
6686,Ted,22, Remember the first night Robin and I went out? I stole a blue French horn for her and it almost worked.,1,How I Met Your Mother,104,21
6687,Marshall,22," Yeah. Dude, that was awesome, but how are you ever going to top that?",1,How I Met Your Mother,70,14
6690,Ted,22, She should be here any second.,1,How I Met Your Mother,31,6
6692,Ted,22," Enough with the... we'll go get pizza later, all right? Just...",1,How I Met Your Mother,64,11
6694,Robin,22, Damn it.,1,How I Met Your Mother,9,2
6696,Lily,22, Hello.,1,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
6697,Robin,22," Hey, Lily, I'm locked out of my apartment. I need to come pick up my extra key.",1,How I Met Your Mother,80,17
6698,Lily,22, Extra key? Do I have an extra key to your apartment?,1,How I Met Your Mother,53,11
6699,Robin,22," Yes, I gave it to you.",1,How I Met Your Mother,23,6
6700,Lily,22," Oh, right. That key. Yeah, I lost it.",1,How I Met Your Mother,38,8
6701,Robin,22," Great, now I gotta go to the locksmith.",1,How I Met Your Mother,40,8
6702,Lily,22," No, wait, uh... Maybe you should just knock.",1,How I Met Your Mother,45,8
6703,Robin,22," Knock? Lily, my dogs aren't that well trained.",1,How I Met Your Mother,47,8
6706,Lily,22," Uh, Robin, I-I gotta go. Just knock, okay?",1,How I Met Your Mother,43,8
6707,Marshall,22, Summer fellowship?,1,How I Met Your Mother,19,2
6708,Robin,22, Just knock. Okay.,1,How I Met Your Mother,18,3
6710,Ted,22, Hi.,1,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
6711,Robin,22, Hi.,1,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
6712,Ted,22," Robin... I've sort of said this already. I mean I've half said it. I've tried to say it, and I've said it badly. So this is me, just saying it. With strings. I'm crazy about you. I think we should be together. What do you say? What do you say?",1,How I Met Your Mother,244,50
6713,Robin,22, Yes. No. I don't know.,1,How I Met Your Mother,23,5
6714,Ted,22, Those are the three options.,1,How I Met Your Mother,29,5
6715,Robin,22," Ted, this is so...",1,How I Met Your Mother,19,4
6716,Ted,22, I know.,1,How I Met Your Mother,8,2
6717,Robin,22," I mean, I come home, I was going to watch Jeopardy and there's a string quartet and... I have to pee.",1,How I Met Your Mother,102,21
6718,Ted,22," Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, well, go ahead. We'll, uh, we'll wait.",1,How I Met Your Mother,58,11
6721,Ted,22," No, I said I'd get you a pizza afterwards. Look, could we talk about this later? I'm sort of professing my love here.",1,How I Met Your Mother,118,23
6724,Robin,22, Okay. Let's talk.,1,How I Met Your Mother,18,3
6725,Ted,22," Okay. Oh, hey, you guys want to take five?",1,How I Met Your Mother,43,9
6726,Robin,22," Thanks, guys. Just need a minute. Sort of a big life decision. Love the blue instruments, though. Kind of an inside joke. Thanks.  You're crazy.",1,How I Met Your Mother,145,25
6727,Ted,22, Right. Come on.,1,How I Met Your Mother,16,3
6728,Robin,22," It's not that I haven't thought about this. You know that I have, but let's look at this, okay? We only just started being friends again.",1,How I Met Your Mother,138,26
6729,Ted,22, I know. But... come on...,1,How I Met Your Mother,26,5
6730,Robin,22," And we want different things. That's still there. That's not going away. I mean, what if we do this and it doesn't work out and I'd lose you as a friend? I gotta think about this.",1,How I Met Your Mother,180,36
6731,Ted,22," Okay, fine. Think about it on the plane. Let's go to Paris for the weekend. I'm serious. I'm kidding. I'm serious.",1,How I Met Your Mother,115,21
6732,Robin,22," I can't go to Paris, I'm going camping.",1,How I Met Your Mother,40,8
6733,Ted,22, I thought that thing was canceled.,1,How I Met Your Mother,35,6
6734,Robin,22," Well, it's back on.",1,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
6735,Ted,22, Since when?,1,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
6736,Robin,22, Since like an hour ago.,1,How I Met Your Mother,24,5
6741,Robin,22, You're leaving?,1,How I Met Your Mother,16,2
6743,Robin,22," Oh, congratulations.",1,How I Met Your Mother,21,2
6745,Robin,22, What do you mean?,1,How I Met Your Mother,18,4
6747,Robin,22," Wow. Thanks. And, yes.",1,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
6749,Robin,22," Yes, let's go get dinner.",1,How I Met Your Mother,26,5
6752,Ted,22," Oh, you're kidding me. No way. Don't go on this thing.",1,How I Met Your Mother,55,11
6753,Robin,22," Ted, I have to go. It's a company camping trip.",1,How I Met Your Mother,48,10
6754,Ted,22, Really? Because it also kinda sounds like a date. With Sandy... and his weenie. I mean is this not a date?,1,How I Met Your Mother,107,21
6755,Robin,22, I don't-I don't know.,1,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
6756,Ted,22," So, what? You actually like this guy now?",1,How I Met Your Mother,42,8
6757,Robin,22, I don't know.,1,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
6758,Ted,22, Are you gonna hook up with him?,1,How I Met Your Mother,32,7
6759,Robin,22, I don't know.,1,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
6760,Ted,22," Yes, you do.",1,How I Met Your Mother,13,3
6761,Robin,22," No, Ted, I don't. And you know what? That's okay. I don't plan out every second of my life like you do.",1,How I Met Your Mother,104,22
6762,Ted,22, I don't plan out every...,1,How I Met Your Mother,26,5
6763,Robin,22," Oh, really? What is all of this? I mean, why can't you just say, ""Hey, Robin, let's go get some sushi?"" No, it has to be a-a string quartet and-and Paris and flowers and chocolates and let's spend the rest of our lives together.",1,How I Met Your Mother,229,44
6764,Ted,22," Don't you think we're a little bit past sushi at this point? God, you are so terrified of anything real. It's like you're floating out in space. Touch the ground, Robin. Live in the world, make a mistake. Make this mistake.",1,How I Met Your Mother,224,41
6765,Robin,22, I need to think about this.,1,How I Met Your Mother,28,6
6766,Ted,22, Fine.,1,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
6767,Robin,22," No, I'm sorry, I... I can't do this anymore. I need an answer.",1,How I Met Your Mother,63,13
6768,Ted,22," If you want me to say yes right now, I-I can't do that.",1,How I Met Your Mother,56,13
6769,Robin,22," Well, if it's not yes, then it's a no.",1,How I Met Your Mother,39,9
6770,Ted,22, Then I guess it's not meant to be.,1,How I Met Your Mother,35,8
6772,Barney,22," Nice try, buddy.",1,How I Met Your Mother,17,3
6774,Marshall,22, Look at the bright side. At least you got some closure. She's made her choice and you can finally move on.,1,How I Met Your Mother,107,21
6775,Ted,22, Screw that. This ain't over.,1,How I Met Your Mother,29,5
6776,Marshall,22," Ted, you sat here in this very booth and you said...",1,How I Met Your Mother,53,11
6777,Ted,22," I don't care what I said. This is gonna happen. She can't say it's not meant to be. It is meant to be, and you know why? 'Cause I mean it to be.",1,How I Met Your Mother,145,33
6779,Lily,22, Unpause?,1,How I Met Your Mother,9,1
6780,Marshall,22, Unpause.,1,How I Met Your Mother,9,1
6782,Marshall,22, A painting fellowship?,1,How I Met Your Mother,23,3
6783,Lily,22, I was never going to take it.,1,How I Met Your Mother,30,7
6784,Marshall,22, In California?,1,How I Met Your Mother,15,2
6785,Lily,22, I was never going to take it.,1,How I Met Your Mother,30,7
6786,Barney,22," Ted, she is going on that camping trip. Dude, barring some act of God, Robin's gonna be with Sandy this weekend.",1,How I Met Your Mother,113,21
6787,Ted,22," Fine. If an act of God is what it takes, then an act of God it is.",1,How I Met Your Mother,67,17
6788,Barney,22, What are you talking about?,1,How I Met Your Mother,28,5
6789,Ted,22, I'm gonna make it rain. I can't let Robin go camping with this guy. So how do I keep that from happening? Simple... I make it rain!,1,How I Met Your Mother,132,27
6790,Barney,22," Ted, do you want me to slap you again? 'Cause I kind of enjoyed it the first time.",1,How I Met Your Mother,83,18
6791,Ted,22," Look, I-I might be crazy right now... No, you know what? I am definitely crazy right now, but I have a plan. That girl you used to go out with, Penelope, wasn't she getting her PhD in Native American culture?",1,How I Met Your Mother,209,40
6792,Barney,22, Yeah.,1,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
6793,Ted,22, Are you still in touch with her?,1,How I Met Your Mother,33,7
6794,Barney,22," Sure. I mean, even though we stopped having s*x, we still get together, like, once a month to chat and catch up, and of course I'm not in touch with her!",1,How I Met Your Mother,154,31
6795,Ted,22," Well, you're gonna need to get in touch with her. She's gonna teach me how to do a rain dance.",1,How I Met Your Mother,95,20
6796,Barney,22," Did you just say a ""rain dance""?",1,How I Met Your Mother,33,7
6797,Ted,22, Yes.,1,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
6798,Barney,22, A rain dance.,1,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
6799,Ted,22, Yes.,1,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
6800,Barney,22, A dance to make it rain.,1,How I Met Your Mother,25,6
6801,Ted,22, Yes.  We're finding Penelope!,1,How I Met Your Mother,30,4
6802,Barney,22," No, we are not!",1,How I Met Your Mother,16,4
6803,Ted,22," Yes, we are!",1,How I Met Your Mother,13,3
6804,Barney,22," Ted, you're forcing me to be the voice of reason, and it's not a good look for me!",1,How I Met Your Mother,83,18
6809,Barney,22," Come on, I know it didn't work out between us, but we did... have a relationship.",1,How I Met Your Mother,82,16
6811,Barney,22, Twice!,1,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
6813,Barney,22, Shh!,1,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
6815,Ted,22," Penelope, I really need to make it rain this weekend.",1,How I Met Your Mother,54,10
6817,Ted,22, There's this girl...,1,How I Met Your Mother,21,3
6819,Ted,22," Penelope, this is the girl I love. If it doesn't rain this weekend, she's gonna end up with the wrong guy. Please.",1,How I Met Your Mother,115,22
6821,Ted,22, Absolutely.,1,How I Met Your Mother,12,1
6823,Ted,22, Kind of.,1,How I Met Your Mother,9,2
6824,Barney,22, Hey.,1,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
6826,Barney,22, We weren't exclusive!,1,How I Met Your Mother,22,3
6832,Barney,22," Wow, it took five shots of tequila to get you in that position.",1,How I Met Your Mother,64,13
6834,Barney,22, There's so much of your mom in you.,1,How I Met Your Mother,36,8
6836,Robin,22, And she's been throwing up ever since.,1,How I Met Your Mother,39,7
6838,Robin,22," Remember that guy, Ted, that I was telling you about? Well, I came home and I found him waiting in my apartment with a string quartet and roses and chocolates...",1,How I Met Your Mother,162,30
6840,Robin,22," Okay, yes, it's sweet in theory, but isn't it also kind of crazy? I mean, a string quartet in my living room... who does that?",1,How I Met Your Mother,127,25
6842,Robin,22, Exactly.,1,How I Met Your Mother,9,1
6846,Lily,22, So you're saying you would forbid me from going?,1,How I Met Your Mother,49,9
6847,Marshall,22," Forbid? Who said forbid? I was just reminding you that there's this wedding coming up in a couple of months, and I was kind of hoping you'd save the day. Look for me... I'll be the guy in the awesome suit. Come on, Lily. It's what you've always wanted.",1,How I Met Your Mother,253,49
6848,Lily,22," Yeah, but there's a lot of things I've always wanted, and I haven't done any of them. I'm sorry. I just need to do this before settling down forever.",1,How I Met Your Mother,150,29
6849,Marshall,22," So now we've gone from ""I was never gonna do it"" to ""I need to do this""? Did I leave the room at some point? When did that happen?",1,How I Met Your Mother,131,29
6850,Lily,22," Oh, maybe when you said you wouldn't let me do it.",1,How I Met Your Mother,51,11
6851,Marshall,22," I never said that! You know, if you're having these kind of doubts now, what's gonna change in three months? Maybe we just shouldn't get married at all.",1,How I Met Your Mother,153,28
6852,Lily,22, Maybe not.,1,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
6853,Marshall,22, Pause.,1,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
6854,Lily,22," So, are you just, like, starving?",1,How I Met Your Mother,34,6
6855,Marshall,22, Totally. Red Lobster?,1,How I Met Your Mother,22,3
6856,Lily,22," Oh, lobster, lobster, lobster, you are delicious!",1,How I Met Your Mother,50,7
6857,Marshall,22," Oh, God, I love butter sauce! There's nothing bad about it. Say something bad about butter sauce, I dare you.",1,How I Met Your Mother,110,20
6858,Lily,22," I wouldn't dare.  Marshall, no. We're on pause. There's no crying in Pauseland! Pauseland is a magical place, with... with popcorn shrimp mountains and butter sauce rivers! Damn it!",1,How I Met Your Mother,182,29
6862,Barney,22," Ted, this is funny. Still funny. Still fu... And now it's sad.",1,How I Met Your Mother,63,12
6863,Ted,22," Hey, Penelope, you sure I'm doing this right?",1,How I Met Your Mother,46,8
6865,Ted,22," Does it, uh, look anything like a real rain dance?",1,How I Met Your Mother,51,10
6867,Ted,22," Hey, Penelope, have you, uh, have you ever actually seen a rain dance performed?",1,How I Met Your Mother,81,14
6869,Ted,22, No?,1,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
6871,Ted,22, Have you ever seen a rain dance?,1,How I Met Your Mother,33,7
6873,Ted,22," Terrific. Uh, look, I should run. I'm getting brain surgery from some guy who's seen a couple episodes of E.R. I can't believe this. We've been up here for the past hour making complete asses of ourselves.",1,How I Met Your Mother,206,37
6876,Marshall,22," How did we get here? Couple of days ago, the biggest problem in my life was, did Ted eat the last pudding snack pack in the fridge.",1,How I Met Your Mother,132,27
6877,Lily,22, I think there's still one left.,1,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
6878,Marshall,22, Dibs.,1,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
6879,Lily,22, Unpause?,1,How I Met Your Mother,9,1
6880,Marshall,22, Unpause.,1,How I Met Your Mother,9,1
6881,Lily,22, Look... I know this sucks. It's just something I'm going through. I'm not asking you to understand it. I'm not asking you to be happy about it. I'm just asking you to support it.,1,How I Met Your Mother,179,34
6882,Marshall,22," I want to, Lily, okay? I really do. But I just can't.",1,How I Met Your Mother,54,12
6883,Lily,22, Why not?,1,How I Met Your Mother,9,2
6884,Marshall,22," Because you're scaring the hell out of me, that's why not. What if you decide to go be a painter and then you realize I don't fit in to your life anymore, and three months becomes forever? Can you promise me that that's not gonna happen?",1,How I Met Your Mother,238,46
6885,Lily,22, Marshall...,1,How I Met Your Mother,12,1
6886,Marshall,22," 'Cause if you can't promise me that, we shoul just break up right now. I'm not gonna wait around for three months just to have my heart ripped out.",1,How I Met Your Mother,148,29
6887,Lily,22," Marshall, I love you.",1,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
6888,Marshall,22, Can you promise me that that's not gonna happen?,1,How I Met Your Mother,49,9
6889,Lily,22, Pause.,1,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
6890,Marshall,22," No, Lily, we cannot pause this anymore. Can you promise me that that's not gonna happen?!",1,How I Met Your Mother,90,16
6891,Lily,22, Pause!,1,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
6892,Marshall,22," Why do you want me to pause?!  That's just a great use of the pause function, baby.",1,How I Met Your Mother,84,17
6893,Lily,22, Thank you.,1,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
6895,Barney,22," Hey, Ted. Whatcha doing?",1,How I Met Your Mother,25,4
6896,Ted,22, A rain dance.,1,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
6897,Barney,22," Dude, that's not a rain dance, that's a fat kid with a bee in his pants.",1,How I Met Your Mother,73,16
6898,Ted,22," Look, I highly doubt the Great Spirit is a stickler for choreography. It's the thought that counts. She's leaving in half an hour.",1,How I Met Your Mother,131,23
6899,Barney,22, These are your awesome years. You're wasting them on this girl. This isn't gonna work!,1,How I Met Your Mother,87,15
6900,Ted,22, Yeah. I know that.,1,How I Met Your Mother,19,4
6901,Barney,22," Well, then why are you doing this?",1,How I Met Your Mother,35,7
6902,Ted,22," Because I love her. I love her! I told her that the first night we went out, and here it is, eight months later, and nothing's changed. So yes, I know this isn't gonna work. But it has to work! You hear me, universe? This is Ted Mosby talking! Give me some rain! Come on! Come on! Come on...!",1,How I Met Your Mother,293,59
6904,Barney,22," Oh, come on!",1,How I Met Your Mother,13,3
6908,Barney,22, How about that? He did it.,1,How I Met Your Mother,27,6
6912,Ted,22," Robin! Hey, Robin!  Oh, thank God you're here!",1,How I Met Your Mother,47,8
6913,Robin,22, My camping trip got rained out.,1,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
6914,Ted,22, I know. I'm sorry.,1,How I Met Your Mother,19,4
6915,Robin,22, It's not your fault.,1,How I Met Your Mother,21,4
6916,Ted,22," Yeah, it is. Come down here.",1,How I Met Your Mother,29,6
6917,Robin,22, It's pouring. You come up.,1,How I Met Your Mother,27,5
6918,Ted,22," No, you have to come down here.",1,How I Met Your Mother,32,7
6919,Robin,22, Why?,1,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
6920,Ted,22," Why? Because I made it rain, that's what I did today! And that's enough. I-I've done my part. Now, get down here!",1,How I Met Your Mother,114,22
6921,Robin,22," I'm not dressed, Ted. No. Come up.",1,How I Met Your Mother,35,7
6922,Ted,22," I'm not coming up there, Robin, I'm not. You have to come down here!",1,How I Met Your Mother,69,14
6924,Robin,22, I was gonna...,1,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
6925,Ted,22, I know.,1,How I Met Your Mother,8,2
6930,Ted,1," OK, where was I? It was June 2006 and life had just taken an unexpected turn.",2,How I Met Your Mother,78,16
6932,Ted,1," Honey, all this stuff I'm telling you is important. It's all part of the story.",2,How I Met Your Mother,80,15
6934,Ted,1," No. The summer of 2006 was both wonderful and awful. For me, it started out great.  In fact, day one was amazing. I'd finally gotten together with Robin. But while I'd been off having one of the best nights of my life, your Uncle Marshall had been having one of the worst nights of his .",2,How I Met Your Mother,288,56
6936,Marshall,1, So that's it? We're breaking up?,2,How I Met Your Mother,33,6
6937,Lily,1," Marshall, I'm sorry. I just... I just need to go to San Francisco and do this art program and figure out who I am outside of us. And the only way that I can do that is if we don't talk for a while.",2,How I Met Your Mother,198,44
6938,Marshall,1," For a while? Try never, OK? You walk out that door and we're done. You're never gonna hear my voice again.",2,How I Met Your Mother,107,21
6940,Marshall,1, I should call her.,2,How I Met Your Mother,19,4
6941,Ted,1," No! No! If you call her, when she asked you not to, you're just gonna look weak and you're gonna regret it. Now, listen. Whenever you feel like calling her, you come find me first... and I will punch you in the face.",2,How I Met Your Mother,217,43
6942,Marshall,1, You're a good friend Ted.,2,How I Met Your Mother,26,5
6944,Robin,1," Hey! So, did you hear the big news?",2,How I Met Your Mother,36,8
6945,Ted,1," You mean how Lily and Marshall broke up and Lily is gone and nothing else even remotely important happened last night? Yeah, I think he knows.",2,How I Met Your Mother,143,26
6946,Robin,1, Oh my god! I... I'm so sorry. What happened?,2,How I Met Your Mother,45,9
6947,Marshall,1," Well, she left. And I don't even know if she's coming back.",2,How I Met Your Mother,60,12
6949,Barney,1," I didn't get your message until I woke up. Bro, I am so sorry.",2,How I Met Your Mother,63,14
6950,Marshall,1, Thanks.,2,How I Met Your Mother,8,1
6951,Barney,1, I know it must be tough. But are you ready to hear something that will not only make you feel better but will actively excite you?,2,How I Met Your Mother,131,26
6952,Marshall,1, Sure.,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
6953,Barney,1," For the first time ever, the three of us are single at the same time. I've dreamed about this day boys and it's going to be legendary! Together, we will own this city. Any time, a girl wants to get back at her ex-boyfriend, we'll be there. Any time a girl wants to solve her father issues through promiscuity and binge-drinking, we will be there. Any time a bachelorette party drives through the city in a limo sticking their heads out, shouting ""What's up New York?"" we will be what is up New York! Gentlemen, we are about to embark on... . Oh man, you guys did it, didn't you?!",2,How I Met Your Mother,580,110
6956,Ted,1, Hey Marshall.,2,How I Met Your Mother,14,2
6957,Marshall,1, Hey Ted.,2,How I Met Your Mother,9,2
6958,Ted,1, Are you hungry?,2,How I Met Your Mother,16,3
6959,Marshall,1," What's the point? I could it some food, it's just gonna leave me.",2,How I Met Your Mother,66,13
6960,Ted,1," At least in that scenario, you get to do the dumping. Come on, it's Sunday, it's pancakes day!",2,How I Met Your Mother,95,18
6961,Marshall,1," Lily always made the pancakes. God, I loved her pancakes. So soft. So warmed. So perfectly shaped.",2,How I Met Your Mother,99,17
6962,Ted,1," Are we still talking about her pancakes? Come on, you gotta eat something. What can I get you?",2,How I Met Your Mother,95,18
6963,Marshall,1, Beer.,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
6964,Ted,1," No, that's what you had for dinner.",2,How I Met Your Mother,36,7
6965,Marshall,1, Fine. Than I'll just have the leftover,2,How I Met Your Mother,39,7
6968,Barney,1," So he stays home all the time not getting laid? No, see, that's what you do when you have a fiancí©e. He should be down here celebrating. He's free. He got that red-head-tumor removed.",2,How I Met Your Mother,185,34
6969,Ted,1, You should write and illustrate children's books.,2,How I Met Your Mother,50,7
6970,Barney,1," You know what Marshall needs to do? He needs to stop being sad. When I get sad, I stop being sad and be awesome instead. True story.",2,How I Met Your Mother,133,27
6971,Ted,1," It's only been a month. He just needs to goat his own pace. Anyway, lily is the one who caused this whole mess.",2,How I Met Your Mother,112,23
6972,Robin,1," Hey, cut her some slack! She's our friend too. She's just trying to figure out who she is.",2,How I Met Your Mother,91,18
6973,Ted,1," Figure out who she is? She should call me. I got a whole list. She's selfish, she's immature, she's...",2,How I Met Your Mother,103,19
6974,Robin,1, What?,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
6975,Ted,1," God, your eyes are so blue.",2,How I Met Your Mother,28,6
6976,Robin,1, Teddy bear... ,2,How I Met Your Mother,15,2
6978,Marshall,1," So, I find her shampoo. I guess she left it here. It smells like her. Like lavender and seashells. Hope. Somehow erotic and comforting all at the same time.",2,How I Met Your Mother,157,29
6979,Robin,1, That's my shampoo.,2,How I Met Your Mother,19,3
6980,Marshall,1, Oh. Sorry.,2,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
6982,Robin,1, I thought he's never go to sleep.,2,How I Met Your Mother,34,7
6983,Ted,1, Uh-oh.,2,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
6984,Robin,1, Already?,2,How I Met Your Mother,9,1
6985,Ted,1, He's calling her. Dammit!,2,How I Met Your Mother,26,4
6986,Robin,1, I don't hear anyth...Ted ,2,How I Met Your Mother,26,4
6987,Marshall,1," Oh! OK, you're right. I won't call her. I will not call her.",2,How I Met Your Mother,61,13
6989,Marshall,1," Well, I called her. And get this, she changed her number. Well like I'm gonna stalk her or something? Like she's so special?! Like she's the only Lily Aldrin out there? 'Cause there are four others in the San Francisco area alone, and they all seem a lot better than her, based on the brief conversations I had with them!",2,How I Met Your Mother,322,60
6990,Robin,1, Does he know I'm in here?,2,How I Met Your Mother,26,6
6991,Marshall,1," Yeah. Hey Robin. Anyway, one of the Lily Adrins...",2,How I Met Your Mother,51,9
6993,Robin,1," This has to stop! Ted, we just started dating. We agreed we don't wanna move too fast and yet somehow we have a baby. He can't feed himself, he cries a lot, he keeps us up all night...",2,How I Met Your Mother,185,38
6994,Barney,1, Have you tried breast-feeding? Nailed it!,2,How I Met Your Mother,42,6
6995,Ted,1, They were together nine years. It's only been a month and a half. He just needs to go his own pace.,2,How I Met Your Mother,100,21
6996,Robin,1, He slept on our floor last night Ted.,2,How I Met Your Mother,38,8
6997,Ted,1, He watched a scary movie.,2,How I Met Your Mother,26,5
6998,Robin,1, It is time for some tough love. We need to get him out of that apartment. He needs fresh air. He needs sunshine.,2,How I Met Your Mother,113,23
6999,Barney,1, Mmm. Sunshine.,2,How I Met Your Mother,15,2
7002,Marshall,1," Barney, I really don't think this is gonna help.",2,How I Met Your Mother,49,9
7003,Barney,1," Do you know why you're not over Lily yet? It's 'cause you can still picture her naked. You can't get over a woman until you can no longer picture her boobs. It's a scientific fact. The average male brain can only store a finite number of boob images, or BPEGs and your hard drive's filled to capacity with Lily's.",2,How I Met Your Mother,314,59
7004,Marshall,1, There are a lot of them.,2,How I Met Your Mother,25,6
7005,Barney,1," They won't go away until you overwrite them with images of other women's boobs. Now, this journey may take as many as a million boobs so we begin here tonight my friend. Two at the time. Those count as four.",2,How I Met Your Mother,208,40
7007,Ted,1," Yeah, this is fun, right? We're outside, it's a beautiful day. The Indians are winning!",2,How I Met Your Mother,88,15
7008,Marshall,1," I gotta admit, it is really nice to be outside.",2,How I Met Your Mother,48,10
7010,Ted,1," Oh, no. ",2,How I Met Your Mother,9,2
7011,Marshall,1," It's all a big lie! She's just gonna break your heart!  You can drag me outta here, but she has no soul!",2,How I Met Your Mother,105,22
7013,Ted,1," We've tried everything. Baseball, strippers. The guy still won't eat a damn pancake. I think he's beyond repair.",2,How I Met Your Mother,113,18
7014,Robin,1," See, this is the problem with guys, you don't know how to deal with heartbreak.",2,How I Met Your Mother,80,15
7015,Barney,1," So what's your prescription, Dr Oestrogen? Eat H&auml;agen-Dazs and Watch Love actually until your periods sync up? ",2,How I Met Your Mother,117,17
7017,Robin,1," Yeah, that's the stuff.",2,How I Met Your Mother,24,4
7018,Marshall,1, Oh my God! How long have you been doing this?,2,How I Met Your Mother,46,10
7019,Robin,1," My Dad taught me to shoot when I was a kid. Now, whenever I'm feeling lonely or depressed, I come here and it reminds me that... guns are fun!",2,How I Met Your Mother,143,29
7020,Marshall,1," Um, you know, Ted is kinda against guns.Robin ",2,How I Met Your Mother,47,8
7021,Marshall,1," Only hell, yes. Oh yeah, yeah. This is what I needed. I felt so powerless this whole time but this... This is power, this is... ",2,How I Met Your Mother,129,25
7022,Robin,1, I should have mention the recoil.,2,How I Met Your Mother,34,6
7024,Ted,1," I'll hand it to you. When he got home, Marshall was smiling. Did you sleep with him? 'Cause I was actually like three days away from suggesting that.",2,How I Met Your Mother,150,28
7025,Robin,1," Sometimes, all you need is to get in touch with your feminine side. ",2,How I Met Your Mother,69,13
7026,Ted,1," Well, congratulations. You're the first person to cheer him up all summer. You win.",2,How I Met Your Mother,84,14
7027,Robin,1, Oh! What do I win?,2,How I Met Your Mother,19,5
7028,Ted,1, I'll tell what you win. I'm taking you away this weekend.,2,How I Met Your Mother,58,11
7029,Robin,1, You are? That's so nice!,2,How I Met Your Mother,25,5
7030,Ted,1," My aunt and uncle have a beach house at Montauk. It's really romantic. My uncle had, like, three affairs there.",2,How I Met Your Mother,112,20
7031,Robin,1," Wow, it must be a nice house. I saw pictures of your uncle. This is so great. We'll finally get some time alone. Are you sure Marshall is gonna be OK with this?",2,How I Met Your Mother,161,33
7033,Marshall,1," Yeah sure. Absolutely. Dude, I'm doing much better. In fact, take my car.",2,How I Met Your Mother,74,13
7034,Ted,1," Really? Hey, thanks. And hey, if you need anything, day or night, just call me. You know what? Please don't call me. What? What's wrong?",2,How I Met Your Mother,137,25
7035,Marshall,1, It's Lily's credit card bill. She must have forgotten to switch her address.,2,How I Met Your Mother,77,13
7036,Ted,1, So?,2,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
7037,Marshall,1, I wonder what kind of charges she's making out there.,2,How I Met Your Mother,54,10
7038,Ted,1," No, no. No good can come from looking at this. You've made too much progress already.",2,How I Met Your Mother,86,16
7039,Marshall,1," I know, but I just...",2,How I Met Your Mother,22,5
7041,Marshall,1," August 5, one charge - tickets. To what? George Clinton and the P-Funk All Stars. August 10, one charge, Tennis Emporium. August 18, two charges. Mario's bistro and - get this - Pet Palace. You guys see what it means right?",2,How I Met Your Mother,224,41
7043,Lily,1," Wow, Mario's bistro. What a perfect place to whore around.",2,How I Met Your Mother,59,10
7045,Lily,1," Oh funk legend George Clinton, I am so glad you spotted me at your concert an drag me on stage to dance with you Courteney Cox style.",2,How I Met Your Mother,134,27
7047,Lily,1," Oh you know, Marshall tried to get me to play tennis for nine years but I didn't do it because I never truly loved him.",2,How I Met Your Mother,120,25
7049,Lily,1," Oh! A ferret. I'll buy it some food next door at the Pet Palace. I've always wanted one, but Marshall have this secret phobia of ferrets.",2,How I Met Your Mother,138,26
7051,Lily,1," It was! Oh, I love you funk legend George Clinton.",2,How I Met Your Mother,51,10
7055,Ted,1, That's the craziest thing I've ever heard.,2,How I Met Your Mother,43,7
7056,Robin,1," Yeah. Why are you afraid of ferrets, they are adorable.",2,How I Met Your Mother,56,10
7057,Marshall,1," Because, Robin, they are like fuzzy tube-shaped rats.",2,How I Met Your Mother,54,8
7058,Barney,1, Those charges are from a month ago.,2,How I Met Your Mother,36,7
7059,Ted,1, Exactly!,2,How I Met Your Mother,9,1
7060,Barney,1," For new charges, you have to go to her online account. You can see credit card activity from like two hours ago. But... You know... Don't... .",2,How I Met Your Mother,143,27
7061,Ted,1, Why do you talk? Why do you talk?,2,How I Met Your Mother,34,8
7063,Barney,1," He needs her password. Its not like he has her password. Ooh, he has her password. This is... He has her password.",2,How I Met Your Mother,115,22
7064,Marshall,1," There is a charge from earlier today. The Kellet Hotel, on Fifth. I don't believe this. Lily is back in New-York.  I can't believe this. Lily's in New-York? I guess I'd been thinking when she got back she's call me. That's the only reason I've been able to hold it together so far this summer.",2,How I Met Your Mother,294,55
7065,Robin,1, This has been holding in together?,2,How I Met Your Mother,35,6
7066,Marshall,1," OK, you know what? I'm calling her.",2,How I Met Your Mother,36,7
7067,Ted,1," No! You're not calling her. This changes nothing.  You, come here. . While we're away this weekend can you keep an eye on him? Make sure he doesn't call her hotel.",2,How I Met Your Mother,164,31
7068,Barney,1, You want me to baby-sit him? 20 bucks. An hour. And money for pizza.,2,How I Met Your Mother,69,14
7069,Ted,1, Um yeah. How about you do it for free or every time we hang out you have to watch this.  Come here my little baby. ,2,How I Met Your Mother,116,25
7070,Barney,1," OK, I'll do it! Stop being a couple.",2,How I Met Your Mother,37,8

7075,Ted,1, Everything we've worked so hard for...!,2,How I Met Your Mother,40,6
7076,Marshall,1," Hello, Lily Aldrin's room please. Thank you.",2,How I Met Your Mother,45,7
7077,Ted,1, Hang up now!,2,How I Met Your Mother,13,3
7078,Marshall,1," Ted, I can't hang up now.",2,How I Met Your Mother,26,6
7079,Ted,1, Hang up now! Hang up now! Hang up now! Hang up!,2,How I Met Your Mother,48,11
7080,Marshall,1, Hello?!  A guy answered. There is... There is a guy in her room. I'm going down there.,2,How I Met Your Mother,87,17
7081,Barney,1, No!,2,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
7082,Ted,1," Dude, you can't...",2,How I Met Your Mother,19,3
7083,Marshall,1, I have to go down there and I have to tell her I love her. I have to beg to take me back even if I have to tell on my knees.,2,How I Met Your Mother,125,32
7084,Robin,1," Marshall, you can't do that!",2,How I Met Your Mother,29,5
7085,Marshall,1, Really? Why not?,2,How I Met Your Mother,17,3
7087,Ted,1," Because you're pathetic! I'm sorry. But right now, you are not Marshall. You are the miserable, whining, shampoo-sniffing ghost of Marshall and frankly, a guy like you doesn't have a shot in hell with a girl like Lily. You know who might have a shot somewhere down the line? Marshall. The real Marshall. But if you go down there now like this, you'll blow it for him and he's never gonna forgive you. Of course, whatever I say, you just will do the opposite so, have a great weekend, good luck screwing up your life. Come on, Robin... Is it still OK if we borrow the car?",2,How I Met Your Mother,572,107
7088,Barney,1, Bold. Bold to go for the car.,2,How I Met Your Mother,30,7
7090,Ted,1, What?,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
7091,Robin,1, I didn't say a thing.,2,How I Met Your Mother,22,5
7092,Ted,1, You think I was too hard on him.,2,How I Met Your Mother,33,8
7093,Robin,1, I didn't say a thing.,2,How I Met Your Mother,22,5
7094,Ted,1, I can't believe you're accusing me to be too hard on him. You're the one who said tough love.,2,How I Met Your Mother,94,19
7095,Robin,1," Yeah, tough love, not hand the guy a noose.",2,How I Met Your Mother,44,9
7096,Ted,1," Oh, but it's OK to hand him a 9 mm? Yeah. He told me. So you're a gun nut?",2,How I Met Your Mother,75,19
7097,Robin,1," No, I'm a gun enthusiast.",2,How I Met Your Mother,26,5
7098,Ted,1, Do you know how many people are killed...,2,How I Met Your Mother,42,8
7099,Robin,1, The Second Amendment protects my right to bear arms...,2,How I Met Your Mother,55,9

7107,Ted,1, Strip-club. Nice. Is Marshall OK?,2,How I Met Your Mother,34,5
7108,Barney,1," Yeah, he's here and he's great. Hang on. Marshall, tell Ted... Uh-oh.",2,How I Met Your Mother,70,12
7110,Ted,1, What? What uh-oh?,2,How I Met Your Mother,18,3
7111,Barney,1, He's gone.,2,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
7112,Ted,1, You lost him? I can't believe it! He's gonna go down to that hotel.,2,How I Met Your Mother,68,14
7113,Barney,1," Crap, you're right. OK, here is the plan. Here is the plan. You go down to the hotel and find him. I'll stay here and get a lap dance. Bye Ted!",2,How I Met Your Mother,144,31
7114,Ted,1, Barney!,2,How I Met Your Mother,8,1

7116,Ted,1, A really nice one.,2,How I Met Your Mother,19,4
7118,Ted,1," Hi. Uh, could you tell me what room Lily Aldrin's in? Thanks. Marshall!",2,How I Met Your Mother,72,13
7119,Marshall,1, Hey.,2,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
7120,Ted,1, What happened?,2,How I Met Your Mother,15,2
7121,Marshall,1," Well, I went up to Lily's floor...",2,How I Met Your Mother,35,7
7123,Marshall,1,"...and I had this little speech in my head. Everything I've been wanting to say to her all summer about love, loyalty, respect. I knocked on the door. .",2,How I Met Your Mother,152,29
7125,Ted,1, You knocked out Lily's new boyfriend?,2,How I Met Your Mother,38,6
7126,Marshall,1, Yeah. It wasn't Lily's boyfriend.,2,How I Met Your Mother,34,5
7127,Ted,1, What? Who was he?,2,How I Met Your Mother,18,4
7130,Lily,1," Oh, this is so embarrassing. I could've sworn I have some change. I know, I know, I'm sorry. Oh, here we go. No that's, that's a button... It was a button. Do you take credit cards?",2,How I Met Your Mother,182,36
7132,Ted,1," So Lily is not back in town and she doesn't have a boyfriend. That's good news, right?",2,How I Met Your Mother,87,17
7133,Marshall,1, Yeah. I don't know. Those credit card charges were the only remaining connection I had to her. I don't know where she is or what she's doing. She was my whole life man and now she's... She's gone.,2,How I Met Your Mother,197,38
7134,Ted,1," You know, first day at college, I showed up, I was so freaked out and I got up to my room and there was my roommate, lying on the bed with his feet up on the wall. He had headphones on, a big smile on his face like he just didn't give a crap. Happy. Confident. Not afraid of anything. That guy was you. You before you met Lily.",2,How I Met Your Mother,328,69
7135,Marshall,1, Ted.,2,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
7136,Ted,1, Yeah.,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
7137,Marshall,1, I was high that day. I was. I was so high I thought you were the dean.,2,How I Met Your Mother,71,17
7138,Ted,1," What I'm saying is, there's a version of you without Lily and... It's not this. You can't let Lily stole your identity the way that guy stole hers.",2,How I Met Your Mother,148,28
7139,Marshall,1," OK.OK! Resolved. Starting tomorrow, I'm going to start being OK. Cheers.",2,How I Met Your Mother,73,11

7187,Barney,2," I-I-I Hate to interrupt but, uh... Do you like magic?",2,How I Met Your Mother,54,10
7190,Barney,2," Dude, you were awesome last night. You were charming, you were funny. You were totally working that girl.",2,How I Met Your Mother,106,18
7191,Marshall,2, You went home with her!,2,How I Met Your Mother,24,5
7192,Barney,2," Yes, I did. But she told me that if it wasn't for me you would've had a shot with her. So in hypothetical terms, you scored last night! All right! Hypothetical high five! Nice! Tonight, we're gonna go to the bar...",2,How I Met Your Mother,215,41

7195,Marshall,2," Oh, really?",2,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
7196,Barney,2," My favorite, number seven. Create a mystery about yourself. That way, they become so intrigued that they have to hang out with you all night.",2,How I Met Your Mother,142,25
7197,Marshall,2," Oh, come on. Does that really work?",2,How I Met Your Mother,36,7

7213,Ted,2, She's happy? Marshall had the worst summer of his life and she's happy. And I suppose her art program was fulfilling or whatever.,2,How I Met Your Mother,130,23
7215,Lily,2," Oh, the art program, best thing ever.",2,How I Met Your Mother,38,7
7219,Lily,2," But the best part of SF - oh that's what we call San Francisco - the people. Even just riding around on the bus all summer, it was like a human tapestry.",2,How I Met Your Mother,154,32
7224,Robin,2," Wow, I am so happy for you.",2,How I Met Your Mother,28,7
7226,Ted,2," Oh, she's such a... godda... God! After what she did to Marshall, she should come back here devastated. Crawling over the broken glass of her own shame and regret.",2,How I Met Your Mother,164,29
7227,Robin,2, You never chose sides. I respect that.,2,How I Met Your Mother,39,7
7228,Ted,2, She's unbelievable! Unbelievable!,2,How I Met Your Mother,34,3

7235,Ted,2," OK, first of all, that is interesting. Second, we have to tell him.",2,How I Met Your Mother,68,13
7236,Robin,2," No, we don't. He's just starting to get better. Going out with Barney. How do you think he'll feel when he hears Lily's moved on?",2,How I Met Your Mother,130,25
7237,Ted,2, She's moved on?,2,How I Met Your Mother,16,3
7238,Robin,2," Well, it happens. I've fallen out of love faster than that before. Sometimes, boom, with no warning whatsoever. One day we're in love, the next day, he's dead to me. But we're great! Honey?",2,How I Met Your Mother,190,34
7240,Barney,2, Let's review Barney's rules for mating without dating. Lesson two,2,How I Met Your Mother,66,10
7241,Marshall,2, Make a beautiful woman feel self-conscious and unattractive and she'll be putty in your hands.,2,How I Met Your Mother,95,15
7242,Barney,2, Excellent. Have you chosen your entrí©e?,2,How I Met Your Mother,41,6
7243,Marshall,2," I have. A sweet brunette, eight o'clock. Nine o'clock. Ten; thirty. She's walking to the bar.",2,How I Met Your Mother,94,16
7244,Barney,2," Her? Really? No, you're right. Ambition is the enemy of success. OK, hit it.",2,How I Met Your Mother,77,14
7245,Marshall,2," Hey four-eyes. You got astigmatism or something? I'm sorry, I was trying to be playful but I just got out of a lonf relationship. I have no idea what I'm doing! I'm Marshall.",2,How I Met Your Mother,175,33
7247,Barney,2, Nice recovery. I think it's working.,2,How I Met Your Mother,37,6
7248,Marshall,2," Um, Amy, this is my friend Barney. Barney, this is Amy.",2,How I Met Your Mother,56,11
7250,Barney,2," Hi. Amy, do you like... magic?",2,How I Met Your Mother,31,6

7253,Barney,2, I am so sorry. It's a sickness. I'm the real victim here.,2,How I Met Your Mother,58,12
7254,Marshall,2, Twice! Twice in a row you took my candy! That was my candy!,2,How I Met Your Mother,60,13
7255,Barney,2, I know but tonight...,2,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
7256,Marshall,2," No, forget it. You're such a jackass!",2,How I Met Your Mother,38,7
7257,Barney,2," I though you were gonna call me a jerk. All right, I'm sorry. But I will make it up to you. Tonight, we'll go to a college bar near NYU. The Scorpion & The Toad. I figure in a younger crowd you'll seem more mature, more worldly. And, as a third-year law student, more smarter.",2,How I Met Your Mother,277,55
7258,Marshall,2," OK, but no magic. . How did you do that?",2,How I Met Your Mother,41,10
7259,Barney,2," I'm taking a leak, dumb-ass.",2,How I Met Your Mother,29,5
7261,Lily,2," But I need the freedom to really chase my passion, which was painting but now, I think it's music, or spoken words. Maybe both. God, isn't life amazing.",2,How I Met Your Mother,153,28
7262,Ted,2, Yeah.,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
7263,Lily,2, It is so great to see you Ted. Ah! I'm gonna get the key for the lockbox.,2,How I Met Your Mother,74,17
7265,Robin,2, What?,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
7266,Ted,2," She's miserable. She's realized she's made a huge mistake. Her and Marshall will be back together in a week, I love it!",2,How I Met Your Mother,120,22
7267,Robin,2," No, you just want Lily to be miserable. The truth is she's happy.",2,How I Met Your Mother,66,13
7268,Ted,2, Trust me. I've known Lily for nine years.,2,How I Met Your Mother,42,8
7269,Robin,2," Trust me, I'm a girl!",2,How I Met Your Mother,22,5
7270,Ted,2, Yeah. But you're Canadian.,2,How I Met Your Mother,27,4
7271,Robin,2, Why do you always have to bring that up?,2,How I Met Your Mother,41,9
7272,Ted,2, You're our weird neighbors!,2,How I Met Your Mother,28,4
7273,Robin,2, You bring it up every time...,2,How I Met Your Mother,30,6
7274,Ted,2," No, alright. Five bucks says she still wants Marshall.",2,How I Met Your Mother,55,9
7275,Robin,2, You're on.,2,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
7276,Ted,2, Five American bucks.,2,How I Met Your Mother,21,3
7277,Robin,2," Dammit! OK, so how do we get the truth out of her?",2,How I Met Your Mother,51,12
7278,Ted,2," Tequila. It's her weakness. Three shots, she tells you the truth about anything.",2,How I Met Your Mother,81,13
7279,Lily,2," I hope this is my new home.  Yeah, I'm gonna take that first apartment.",2,How I Met Your Mother,72,14
7281,Barney,2," Marshall Eriksen, suit up!",2,How I Met Your Mother,27,4
7282,Marshall,2, No way.,2,How I Met Your Mother,8,2
7283,Barney,2, Yeah you're good in that. Let's go.,2,How I Met Your Mother,36,7
7284,Marshall,2, Wait. Empty your pockets. Come on.,2,How I Met Your Mother,35,6
7285,Barney,2, Come on...,2,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
7286,Marshall,2, Sleeves.,2,How I Met Your Mother,9,1
7287,Barney,2, There is nothing in my sl...,2,How I Met Your Mother,29,6
7288,Marshall,2, Oh is that right?,2,How I Met Your Mother,18,4
7289,Barney,2, Huh? Huh? Let's go.,2,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
7290,Marshall,2, Behind my ear.,2,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
7291,Barney,2, Oh there is nothing behind your... Ohh!,2,How I Met Your Mother,40,7
7292,Marshall,2, Ohh!,2,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
7296,Marshall,2," Oh, tell me about it. I'm a third year at Columbia Law, so... If the workload does kill you I can probably get a conviction. Yeah.",2,How I Met Your Mother,131,26
7300,Marshall,2," Yes, it would. It really would.",2,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
7302,Marshall,2," Probably not. I'm never here, so...",2,How I Met Your Mother,36,6
7304,Marshall,2, Great. Nice.,2,How I Met Your Mother,13,2
7305,Barney,2," Hi, I'm Barney.",2,How I Met Your Mother,16,3
7306,Marshall,2," Oh, no.",2,How I Met Your Mother,8,2
7307,Barney,2, Do you mind giving my friend your phone number?,2,How I Met Your Mother,48,9
7310,Marshall,2," Whoo! I did it! I got a girl's phone number! Oh, and her handwriting is so cute. Look. I'll take her out for Chinese food and then we'll walk through the park. It'll be so... What?",2,How I Met Your Mother,181,36
7311,Barney,2," Sorry buddy, I'm taking this one too.",2,How I Met Your Mother,38,7
7312,Marshall,2, I'll kill you!,2,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
7314,Lily,2," And then I discovered this area, North beach. Best beach ever! Oh, I've been blabbering on about my summer. How are you guys doing? And hey, how is Marshall?",2,How I Met Your Mother,158,29
7316,Marshall,2, Gimme the card! I swear I'm gonna...,2,How I Met Your Mother,37,7
7317,Barney,2, I'm not giving you...,2,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
7319,Ted,2, Terrific.,2,How I Met Your Mother,10,1
7320,Lily,2," That is so good to hear. . Oh, hold on. This could be about he apartment. .",2,How I Met Your Mother,76,17
7321,Ted,2," OK, we're way past truth-telling Lily and about to hit Cinco-de-Mayo-1998 Lily, and I'm not cleaning that up again. So, congratulations. You win, she's happy.",2,How I Met Your Mother,159,25
7323,Lily,2, I didn't get it. That first apartment. I... I waited too long and somebody else got it. .,2,How I Met Your Mother,90,18
7324,Ted,2," Interesting. Wow Lily, you, uh, seem to be having a pretty strong reaction to losing this apartment. I wonder is it because it reminds you of something you lost because you couldn't commit?",2,How I Met Your Mother,190,33
7325,Robin,2," No, Lily you're crying over the crown moulding and the real hardwood floor. There's no deeper meaning, right Lily? Just quit crying and tell him.",2,How I Met Your Mother,146,25
7326,Lily,2, The apartment is a metaphor for Marshall! ,2,How I Met Your Mother,43,7
7328,Barney,2, Stop it!,2,How I Met Your Mother,9,2
7329,Marshall,2, You don't want to see me when I'm angry!,2,How I Met Your Mother,41,9
7330,Barney,2," Stop! If we can't settle this like gentlemen, then no one gets the number. .",2,How I Met Your Mother,77,15
7331,Marshall,2, Stop the cab! ,2,How I Met Your Mother,15,3

7337,Ted,2, Gravy.,2,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
7339,Ted,2, Surprise me.,2,How I Met Your Mother,13,2
7340,Robin,2, I'd take you with gravy if my boyfriend wasn't sitting right here! Just kidding. I'm good.,2,How I Met Your Mother,91,16
7341,Lily,2, What are you charpy about?,2,How I Met Your Mother,27,5
7342,Ted,2, She's still drunk from last night.,2,How I Met Your Mother,35,6
7343,Robin,2, I don't think so! Whoo!,2,How I Met Your Mother,24,5
7344,Ted,2," Look, if you want Marshall back so bad, how come it took you two days to ask about him?",2,How I Met Your Mother,88,19
7345,Lily,2, I was dying to ask. I was just trying to play it cool. But really...,2,How I Met Your Mother,69,15
7347,Robin,2," But it's good, I mean work's great...",2,How I Met Your Mother,38,7
7348,Lily,2," Say something about Marshall. Where is Marshall? How's Marshall? What's Marshall doing right now?  Shut up and talk about Marshall. Shut up and talk about Marshall! Shut up and talk about Marshall! Marshall! Marshall! Marshall! Marshall! Aaah I gotta ask!  And, hey, how is Marshall?",2,How I Met Your Mother,284,45
7350,Lily,2, It was such an awful summer! I just wanted to get back here and see him.,2,How I Met Your Mother,73,16
7351,Ted,2, But I thought your summer was great?!,2,How I Met Your Mother,38,7
7352,Lily,2, Not exactly...,2,How I Met Your Mother,15,2
7356,Ted,2, So all those interesting people you met on the bus...?,2,How I Met Your Mother,55,10
7357,Lily,2," Yeah, um...",2,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
7362,Lily,2," I never got in touch because I was too embarrassed. I screwed everything up. I have no job, no place to live. I lost the love of my life. Look, I know I have no right to ask this but do you think Marshall would take me back?",2,How I Met Your Mother,225,48
7363,Ted,2," In a heartbeat. If you called him up, yeah, he'd take you back with open arms.",2,How I Met Your Mother,79,16
7364,Lily,2," Wow. So, maybe I should call him?",2,How I Met Your Mother,34,7
7365,Ted,2," Maybe. No! This is... Ooww... Hold on. Look. If you're gonna go back to him, I don't wanna hear the word ""maybe"". ""Maybe"" cannot be in your vocabulary. This break-up almost killed him. And he cannot go through it again. So, unless you're absolutely certain, stay the hell away from him.",2,How I Met Your Mother,287,51
7366,Robin,2, This guy like pennies!,2,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
7368,Barney,2, Hi Marshall.,2,How I Met Your Mother,13,2
7369,Marshall,2," No, go away, I don't want to talk to you.",2,How I Met Your Mother,42,10
7370,Barney,2," OK. I know what I did a couple nights back was is in a moral grey area. But the great news is she loved you. If things had gone your way, you'd gone out a couple time, I think she definitely would've had s*x with you.",2,How I Met Your Mother,218,46
7371,Marshall,2," There is no ""would"" in s*x. There totally is. I'm just no good at this Barney! I'm good at being in a couple. I'm good at being Lily's boyfriend. Being single, forget it.",2,How I Met Your Mother,171,33
7372,Barney,2," You can't give up now. What if I told you that you could relive that night with the exact same conversations, the exact same jokes, only this time you get her and I don't.",2,How I Met Your Mother,172,34
7373,Marshall,2, That's not possible.,2,How I Met Your Mother,21,3
7374,Barney,2," Oh, but it is. She has... Wait for it. Here it comes. Almost there...an identical twin. Yes!",2,How I Met Your Mother,93,17
7375,Marshall,2, A twin isn't the same person.,2,How I Met Your Mother,30,6
7376,Barney,2," Of course, it is. What do you think ""identical"" means? ""Ident-"" - same. ""-ical"" - person. Same person. Hey, we could double date.",2,How I Met Your Mother,130,23
7377,Marshall,2, Fine.,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
7378,Barney,2, Ah!,2,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
7379,Marshall,2," But you have to promise me you're not gonna steal my new twin and leave me with your old, used-up twin.",2,How I Met Your Mother,104,21
7380,Barney,2, Used-up? They're a human being Marshall.,2,How I Met Your Mother,41,6
7382,Barney,2, How are you doing?,2,How I Met Your Mother,19,4
7383,Marshall,2, Great. Amazing. This is so much fun. Me and the girl are really cliking.,2,How I Met Your Mother,73,14
7384,Barney,2," You are. You definitely are. Listen, you're gonna have to leave now. I just talked with the twins and, get this, I'm going home with both of them! Yeah. That's happening.",2,How I Met Your Mother,171,31
7385,Marshall,2, It is impossible that you're doing this to me again.,2,How I Met Your Mother,53,10
7386,Barney,2, But they're twins.,2,How I Met Your Mother,19,3
7387,Marshall,2, You said to me that being single would be like being in a candy store.,2,How I Met Your Mother,71,15
7388,Barney,2," Well, it's not like a candy store. It's a lawless, post-apocalyptic wasteland. I may be your best friend...",2,How I Met Your Mother,108,18
7389,Marshall,2, Ted's my best friend.,2,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
7390,Barney,2,"...but in this world it's every hombre for himself. That's what being single is. And after nine years of captivity, that is the single greatest lesson I can teach you about surviving in the wild. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have two unique breasts an two duplicates waiting for me. . Oh bad news. Marshall got food poisoning.",2,How I Met Your Mother,325,59
7393,Barney,2, Yeah. I guess we're just a threesome tonight.,2,How I Met Your Mother,46,8
7395,Marshall,2, Lily. What are you doing here?,2,How I Met Your Mother,31,6
7396,Lily,2," Oh, I-I was just walking by. I wasn't... Oh, you mean, New-York? My program ended. It was just great. Just lots of fun. It was awful. It was the worst mistake I ever made. I'm so sorry Marshall. And, hello.",2,How I Met Your Mother,207,40
7397,Marshall,2," Lily, this was the worst summer of my life.",2,How I Met Your Mother,44,9
7398,Lily,2, I know. It was the worst summer of my life.,2,How I Met Your Mother,44,10
7399,Marshall,2, It was the hardest thing I've ever had to go through.,2,How I Met Your Mother,54,11
7400,Lily,2, Can we please get back together?,2,How I Met Your Mother,33,6
7401,Marshall,2," All that crap you said to me about ""we need to figure out who we are outside of us, and we need to learn to do things on our own."". It broke my heart. Three months ago, you broke my heart.",2,How I Met Your Mother,189,41
7402,Lily,2, Can we please get back together?,2,How I Met Your Mother,33,6
7403,Marshall,2," Lily, you were right. All that crap was right. So, no. No, we can't get back together. We shouldn't. At least, not right now.",2,How I Met Your Mother,126,24
7404,Lily,2, Wow. OK. Yeah. Wi... Will we still see each other?,2,How I Met Your Mother,51,10
7405,Marshall,2, Yeah. Yeah. I think so. I don't know. This is all really new to me. I just got out of a long relationship. I like your hair.,2,How I Met Your Mother,125,27

7412,Lily,2," You gave me Chlamydia, you jerk! ",2,How I Met Your Mother,34,6
7413,Barney,2," So, where was I? Ah yes. Assistant mí©nage-er. I did it again. I can't believe it!",2,How I Met Your Mother,83,16
7415,Lily,2, You gave my twin sister Chlamydia! You slime! .,2,How I Met Your Mother,48,9
7417,Ted,3," Kids you know that photo in the den? It was taken back in 2006, when Grandma and Grandpa came to visit me and we all went out to brunch. We all look pretty happy, right? Wrong.",2,How I Met Your Mother,177,36

7442,Marshall,3, Lily calling off the wedding and dumping me?,2,How I Met Your Mother,45,8
7443,Lily,3, Me begging Marshall to take me back and him rejecting me?,2,How I Met Your Mother,58,11

7467,Marshall,3," Lily is evil! She just wore that dress to torture me. Well, you know what? Two can play at that game. See, at brunch, I'm going to torture Lily right back. Yeah. There's a part of my body that she's got a weakness for, too.",2,How I Met Your Mother,224,45

7469,Marshall,3," No, not that. I'm going to unleash my calves.",2,How I Met Your Mother,46,9
7470,Barney,3, That's crazy. Nobody's turned on by men's calves. They're a thoroughly unerotic body part.,2,How I Met Your Mother,91,14
7471,Marshall,3," Well, yeah, I'd say that, too, if I had those skinny little chicken legs.",2,How I Met Your Mother,74,14

7496,Marshall,3," Well, it's not but I'm still mad about it.",2,How I Met Your Mother,43,9
7497,Lily,3," All right, that's it - I want The Beatles Anthology.",2,How I Met Your Mother,53,10
7498,Marshall,3," Oh, well, that's too bad. I'm keeping it! And you know the U2 box set I gave you? Look inside - all Dave Matthews.",2,How I Met Your Mother,115,24
7499,Lily,3, You are evil.,2,How I Met Your Mother,14,3

7508,Ted,3," Barney, what are you doing here?",2,How I Met Your Mother,33,6
7509,Barney,3, Uh... I'm here to meet your parents. They must be dying to meet me after all the legendary Barney stories you've told them.,2,How I Met Your Mother,124,23
7510,Ted,3, I haven't told them any legendary Barney stories.,2,How I Met Your Mother,50,8
7511,Barney,3, What?,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
7512,Ted,3," Barney, here is a list of all the things I talk with my dad about",2,How I Met Your Mother,66,15

7517,Barney,3, How could your parents not know about me? I'm delightful.,2,How I Met Your Mother,58,10

7519,Barney,3," Oh, really? Then I guess those shoes aren't the thing you're most wrong about today.",2,How I Met Your Mother,85,15
7521,Ted,3," Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad.",2,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
7523,Ted,3, I know you've all been excited to meet...,2,How I Met Your Mother,42,8

7531,Barney,3," San Marino! Oh, you're serious? Yikes. No. We have to try Casa A Pezzi. Best salmon risotto I have ever had.",2,How I Met Your Mother,109,21
7533,Barney,3, I know.,2,How I Met Your Mother,8,2
7534,Robin,3, How are we supposed to get a table at Casa A Pezzi? They're booked for weeks.,2,How I Met Your Mother,78,16
7535,Barney,3," Well, lucky for you, I happen to know the head waitress, which is ironic because...",2,How I Met Your Mother,84,15
7536,Ted,3," Stop it! Don't, don't!",2,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
7537,Barney,3," Ironic because we both work at a homeless shelter where I serve the food. Where do you volunteer, Robin?",2,How I Met Your Mother,105,19
7539,Robin,3," What's the matter with you? I'm his girlfriend, and I'm not even trying that hard. Way to wreck the curve, kiss-ass.",2,How I Met Your Mother,117,21
7540,Barney,3," Robin, I'm his best friend. That's a commitment. Girlfriend? That's like a bad flu. Out of your system after a couple weeks in bed. High five!",2,How I Met Your Mother,143,26

7557,Barney,3," St. Peter's, 8",2,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
7558,Ted,3, Wait a minute. You're able to cross the threshold of a church?,2,How I Met Your Mother,63,12
7559,Barney,3, I'll save you a seat.,2,How I Met Your Mother,22,5
7561,Robin,3, Robin.,2,How I Met Your Mother,7,1

7565,Ted,3, Why?,2,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
7566,Barney,3," Last night, we go to MacLaren's for a drink, right?",2,How I Met Your Mother,52,10
7570,Barney,3," Oh, I'm no hero, Wendy. You know who is a hero? My Dalmatian, Smokey. He... didn't... make it out. I'm sorry.",2,How I Met Your Mother,110,21
7573,Barney,3, I'm... oh. .,2,How I Met Your Mother,13,3
7575,Ted,3," My dad was your wingman? This is really messing with my head. Barney, is... Is my dad cool?",2,How I Met Your Mother,92,18
7576,Barney,3," I'm not done. So, your dad stays to finish his drink, but I take off because I have to be up early for Mass with your mom.",2,How I Met Your Mother,123,27
7577,Ted,3, Sure.,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
7578,Barney,3," Anyway, I realize that I left my phone on the bar, so I come back...",2,How I Met Your Mother,69,15
7580,Ted,3," Oh, my God! Is that really...? Oh, my God!",2,How I Met Your Mother,43,9
7581,Barney,3, I know. Can you believe your dad rack-jacked me like that?,2,How I Met Your Mother,59,11
7582,Ted,3," My dad made out with Wendy the waitress? He cheated on my mom? No, that's impossible.",2,How I Met Your Mother,86,16
7583,Barney,3," Ted, it's a well-known statistic that 83% of people married longer than six months are seeing someone on the side.",2,How I Met Your Mother,115,20
7584,Ted,3," Do you know that when you make up a statistic, you always use ""83%""?",2,How I Met Your Mother,69,14
7585,Barney,3," You think I'm lying. Well, have you done any surveys on the subject? Because the good people at  m http",2,How I Met Your Mother,104,20
7586,Ted,3, That's not a real Web site.,2,How I Met Your Mother,28,6
7587,Barney,3," Oh, and I suppose I didn't get a real T-shirt for running in their 10K.",2,How I Met Your Mother,72,15
7589,Ted,3," Hi, Dad.",2,How I Met Your Mother,9,2
7591,Ted,3, Enjoying your vacation so far?,2,How I Met Your Mother,31,5
7593,Ted,3," Uh, listen, can I speak to you outside for a sec?",2,How I Met Your Mother,50,11

7601,Ted,3, Yeah. So...,2,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
7603,Ted,3, Well...,2,How I Met Your Mother,8,1
7605,Ted,3, You think Cerrano's got a shot at the RBI title?,2,How I Met Your Mother,49,10
7607,Ted,3," I wanted to confront him, but I couldn't. I guess I got the let's-not-talk-about-anything-uncomfortable gene",2,How I Met Your Mother,109,15
7608,Barney,3," Well, you didn't get your dad's close-the-deal gene, that's for sure.",2,How I Met Your Mother,70,11
7610,Robin,3, I don't care how unpleasant it is. You have to talk to him.,2,How I Met Your Mother,60,13
7612,Robin,3," Okay, if you don't, I will.",2,How I Met Your Mother,28,6
7618,Ted,3, One last thing about my mom. She grills every single one of my girlfriends about when we're gonna get married and have kids.,2,How I Met Your Mother,125,23
7619,Robin,3, But this is the first time she's meeting me.,2,How I Met Your Mother,45,9
7620,Ted,3, Doesn't matter. And you'll know it's coming when she mentions my cousin Stacy,2,How I Met Your Mother,78,13
7621,Robin,3, But I don't want to get married and have kids. What am I supposed to say?,2,How I Met Your Mother,74,16
7622,Ted,3, You know what? You're an adult with perfectly valid opinions. You shouldn't have to apologize for them.,2,How I Met Your Mother,104,17
7623,Robin,3, I'm gonna lie.,2,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
7624,Ted,3, I would.,2,How I Met Your Mother,9,2
7626,Lily,3, Thanks again for letting me have the U2 box set.,2,How I Met Your Mother,49,10
7627,Marshall,3, I know how important it is to you.,2,How I Met Your Mother,35,8

7637,Barney,3," Ooh, a piano!",2,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
7639,Ted,3," You lucked out with my mom last night, huh? What a relief, right?",2,How I Met Your Mother,66,13
7640,Robin,3," Oh, absolutely. Whew, what a relief it is to know I'm the one girlfriend your mom doesn't want you to have kids with.",2,How I Met Your Mother,118,23
7641,Ted,3, Hooray?,2,How I Met Your Mother,8,1
7642,Robin,3," I mean, did she really think that your college girlfriend Cheryl would pop out attractive children? 'Cause I've seen pictures, and, I'm sorry, that girl had a brow ridge like a caveman.",2,How I Met Your Mother,186,32
7643,Ted,3," Come on, she was just frowning under direct light. And besides, that's not even what I liked about her. It was her... It's not important.",2,How I Met Your Mother,138,25
7645,Barney,3, What happened to Marshall and Lily?,2,How I Met Your Mother,36,6
7646,Ted,3, They've been fighting lately. They're probably off somewhere going at it.,2,How I Met Your Mother,74,11
7649,Robin,3," Well, if she's so sweet, maybe she should have Ted's babies.",2,How I Met Your Mother,61,11
7651,Robin,3, Nothing. ,2,How I Met Your Mother,10,1
7652,Lily,3, Just a minute.,2,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
7653,Marshall,3, Maybe less.,2,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
7655,Robin,3, Why don't you want me to have your grandkids?,2,How I Met Your Mother,46,9
7657,Robin,3," No! I mean, I don't know. I just... I want you to want me to want to have your grandkids. And you should. I'm a genetic gold mine. No family history of diabetes or heart disease. Everyone has nonporous teeth and perfect eyesight. I had one schizophrenic uncle but even he had perfect vision. Which was unfortunate for the people around the bell tower he was in, but still he was a very fine man, and...",2,How I Met Your Mother,403,76
7659,Marshall,3, Excuse me. Sorry. Didn't know that there was a line.,2,How I Met Your Mother,53,10
7660,Lily,3," Marshall, your zipper.",2,How I Met Your Mother,23,3
7662,Robin,3," Why do you say that? I mean, you got married pretty young. That wasn't a mistake. Was it?",2,How I Met Your Mother,90,18
7666,Lily,3, I wish your face would melt off.,2,How I Met Your Mother,33,7
7667,Marshall,3, I wish your eyeballs would explode.,2,How I Met Your Mother,36,6
7668,Ted,3, I'm gonna kill him.,2,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
7669,Robin,3," I don't care how unpleasant it is, you have to talk to him.",2,How I Met Your Mother,60,13
7671,Robin,3," Okay, if you don't, I will.",2,How I Met Your Mother,28,6
7674,Ted,3," Sweetheart? Sweetheart?! The only sweetheart in your life should be the woman you married 30 years ago, not the waitress at the bar last night and not this clumsy floozy!  I'm sorry, you're not a floozy. I'm upset, I don't know what I'm saying. But stay away from my dad.",2,How I Met Your Mother,272,50
7676,Ted,3," Dad? You, uh, want to tell Mom what happened at the bar last night?",2,How I Met Your Mother,68,14
7679,Ted,3, Oh?,2,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
7681,Ted,3," Serious talk? Mom, what...? He was kissing another woman. Don't you care?",2,How I Met Your Mother,74,12
7682,Robin,3, Mrs. Mosby?,2,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
7685,Ted,3, What do you mean you're divorced? Since when?,2,How I Met Your Mother,46,8
7689,Ted,3," So ten months ago, you just up and decided to get divorced without telling me?",2,How I Met Your Mother,79,15
7692,Ted,3, How could you not tell me this?!,2,How I Met Your Mother,33,7
7694,Ted,3, So last Christmas...?,2,How I Met Your Mother,22,3
7696,Ted,3, I got you a tandem bike.,2,How I Met Your Mother,25,6
7698,Ted,3, Who the hell is Frank?!,2,How I Met Your Mother,24,5
7700,Ted,3," Okay, my head's about to explode, and I don't want to get it all over everyone's waffles, so I am leaving. ",2,How I Met Your Mother,108,21
7702,Barney,3," You know, he mentioned he was divorced last night. I totally spaced on that. Ooh, no line at the omelet station.",2,How I Met Your Mother,113,21
7703,Marshall,3, Lily... I'm sorry that I said all those things.,2,How I Met Your Mother,48,9
7704,Lily,3," Me, too.",2,How I Met Your Mother,9,2
7705,Marshall,3, I just find it really confusing to be around you right now.,2,How I Met Your Mother,60,12
7706,Lily,3, It's the same for me. I think we're probably both better off trying to keep some distance for a while.,2,How I Met Your Mother,103,20
7707,Marshall,3," Yeah, I think you're right. Are you wearing a push-up bra?",2,How I Met Your Mother,59,11
7708,Lily,3, Did you Mystic Tan your calves?,2,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
7709,Marshall,3, I withdraw the question.,2,How I Met Your Mother,25,4
7712,Ted,3, Thank you.,2,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
7715,Ted,3," No, this is ridiculous! We have to start talking about stuff, and not just baseball.",2,How I Met Your Mother,85,15
7717,Ted,3," Against the Red Sox? Boy, that's a big win. No. No. No. We're not gonna blow past this. I mean, I don't even know who you people. I don't even know how you met.",2,How I Met Your Mother,161,34
7719,Ted,3, No.,2,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
7721,Ted,3," That's it? That's what passes for communication in our family? Man, when I have kids, and I tell them how I met their mother, I'm gonna tell them everything, the whole damn story.",2,How I Met Your Mother,180,33
7723,Ted,3," I just, I don't... I don't understand. You seemed so happy. When I was growing up, you seemed so... What happened?",2,How I Met Your Mother,115,21
7726,Ted,3, So? Robin and I are like that. That doesn't mean anything.,2,How I Met Your Mother,59,11
7728,Ted,3, Robin and I have different views on families. We're not about to break up because of it.,2,How I Met Your Mother,89,17
7735,Robin,3, Wow.,2,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
7736,Ted,3, I know.,2,How I Met Your Mother,8,2
7737,Robin,3, They love me!,2,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
7740,Ted,3," Good. Good, I think it'll be really good for the family. By the way, how's Grandma? She hasn't returned my last couple calls.",2,How I Met Your Mother,126,23
7742,Ted,3, No. No.,2,How I Met Your Mother,8,2
7745,Ted,4," Well, we just had our first fight.",2,How I Met Your Mother,35,7
7747,Robin,4, We had our first fight.,2,How I Met Your Mother,24,5
7749,Barney,4," Oh, no, what'd you fight about? .",2,How I Met Your Mother,34,7
7750,Ted,4," A few months ago, my architecture firm was approached to design this new building...",2,How I Met Your Mother,85,14
7752,Robin,4, It's this big skyscraper in Spokane. It'd be a huge project for his firm.,2,How I Met Your Mother,74,14
7754,Ted,4," And if we don't get it, we could go under.",2,How I Met Your Mother,43,10
7756,Robin,4," So anyway, the head architect unveils his new design to the whole company.",2,How I Met Your Mother,75,13
7760,Ted,4, Yes.,2,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
7761,Marshall,4," Well, all skyscrapers kind of look like a...",2,How I Met Your Mother,45,8
7762,Ted,4," Marshall, it's a 78-story pink marble tower with a rounded top and two spherical entryways at the front.",2,How I Met Your Mother,105,18
7763,Marshall,4," Wow, so it's the whole package.",2,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
7764,Barney,4," Yeah, you did.",2,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
7765,Marshall,4, Had to.,2,How I Met Your Mother,8,2
7766,Barney,4," Oh, dude, if they're selling condos, you got to get me in. And don't give me the shaft.",2,How I Met Your Mother,88,18
7767,Marshall,4," Yeah, you did.",2,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
7768,Barney,4, Had to.,2,How I Met Your Mother,8,2
7769,Ted,4," It's a travesty. It's gonna define the skyline of the city. If it was me, I could've designed something amazing. Instead, I'm spending 12 hours a day designing the cornices.",2,How I Met Your Mother,174,30
7770,Marshall,4," Yeah, you did.",2,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
7771,Ted,4, That wasn't one.,2,How I Met Your Mother,17,3
7774,Lily,4," So you and Ted had your first fight. It obviously ended well. I mean, you're here with me.",2,How I Met Your Mother,91,18
7775,Robin,4," Actually, it didn't end at all. I started getting bummed out, so I came here. It's what I do. When my grandma died, I got a perm.",2,How I Met Your Mother,130,27
7776,Lily,4," Ooh, two tragedies in one day.",2,How I Met Your Mother,31,6
7777,Robin,4," The thing is, Ted has been literally complaining about work nonstop for weeks. So, when I came over today, I was kind of done.",2,How I Met Your Mother,127,24
7779,Ted,4, Hey.,2,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
7780,Robin,4, Hey.,2,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
7781,Ted,4, How was your day?,2,How I Met Your Mother,18,4
7782,Robin,4, Good.,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
7783,Ted,4," Wow, you're a great interviewer. Aren't you gonna ask how my day was?",2,How I Met Your Mother,70,13
7784,Robin,4," No, I know how it was. It was awful. Ooh, you want to rent a movie tonight?",2,How I Met Your Mother,76,17
7785,Ted,4," You know, um... I listen to your work stories all the time.",2,How I Met Your Mother,60,12
7786,Robin,4," Yeah, but... and I don't want to be rude here, but my work stories are interesting. I'm a television news reporter.",2,How I Met Your Mother,116,21
7788,Lily,4, Robin!,2,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
7789,Robin,4, What? I knew exactly what he was going to say. I was just helping him get there faster.,2,How I Met Your Mother,88,18
7790,Lily,4, You should work at a suicide hotline.,2,How I Met Your Mother,38,7
7791,Robin,4, And then it got ugly.,2,How I Met Your Mother,22,5
7793,Robin,4," What I don't do is tell you the same story over and over again. I mean, you wouldn't watch the same movie over and over again, would you? Maybe a great movie like Die Hard. But Field of Dreams? Once is more than enough.",2,How I Met Your Mother,220,44
7795,Ted,4, So that's your go-to bad movie? The number one example on the tip of your tongue of a bad movie is Field of Dreams?,2,How I Met Your Mother,116,24
7796,Robin,4, It's about ghost baseball players. I think it's stupid.,2,How I Met Your Mother,56,9
7798,Robin,4," So, now he's all mad at me about the stupid movie.",2,How I Met Your Mother,51,11
7799,Lily,4," Robin, he's upset because you wouldn't listen to him, not because you didn't like some movie.",2,How I Met Your Mother,94,16
7801,Ted,4, How do you not like Field of Dreams?!,2,How I Met Your Mother,38,8
7803,Lily,4," Listening is the foundation of a relationship. And if he's really droning on, you can always practice saying the alphabet backwards. You know, in case you get pulled over for a DUI.",2,How I Met Your Mother,182,32
7804,Robin,4, I guess I don't know how to do that.,2,How I Met Your Mother,37,9
7805,Lily,4," Yeah, it's really hard, even when you're sober. That's what I tried to explain to the cop.",2,How I Met Your Mother,91,17
7806,Robin,4," No, I mean, I guess I don't know how to do this girlfriend thing. I've never been in a relationship this serious before. I should probably go tell him I'm sorry, shouldn't I? You're trying to do it right now, aren't you?",2,How I Met Your Mother,221,42
7807,Lily,4," What the hell comes before ""Q""?",2,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
7809,Ted,4," Then at the end of the movie when he has a catch with his dad, like... Like he never did when he was young enough for it to matter.",2,How I Met Your Mother,132,29
7810,Barney,4, Can we talk about something else?,2,How I Met Your Mother,34,6
7811,Marshall,4," You know what, dude? Forget about Robin, okay? You're hanging with us tonight. I've got an awome party lined up.",2,How I Met Your Mother,113,20
7812,Barney,4," Oh, God! This gonna be another one of your weird all-guy parties?",2,How I Met Your Mother,66,12
7813,Marshall,4," That was a poker game. What is wrong with you? No, it's the first law school party of the year and it's gonna be awesome. I haven't seen this guys since, like, last year before Lily and I broke up. So I'm gonna have to break the news to everybody. It's really gonna bum them out. This party's gonna suck.",2,How I Met Your Mother,305,60
7814,Barney,4," Well, love to join you at that one. But I got tickets to Foxy Boxing.",2,How I Met Your Mother,70,15
7815,Ted,4," I wish I could join you guys, but I got to get back to my apparently boring job.",2,How I Met Your Mother,81,18
7816,Marshall,4, Your job's not boring.,2,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
7817,Ted,4, Robin thinks so.,2,How I Met Your Mother,17,3
7818,Barney,4," Dude, lots of chicks think architects are hot. Think about it, you create something out of nothing. You're like God. There's nobody hotter than God.",2,How I Met Your Mother,149,25
7819,Ted,4, I love it when you quote Scripture.,2,How I Met Your Mother,36,7
7820,Barney,4," I'm telling you, you should use the architect angle with the ladies.",2,How I Met Your Mother,69,12
7821,Ted,4," Okay, first of all, I have a girlfriend. Second, the architect angle doesn't even work on her. And, third, I can't imagine that working on anyone ever.",2,How I Met Your Mother,152,27
7822,Barney,4," That's 'cause you're always like...  ""Ted Mosby, architect"". If it were me, I'd be like...  ""Ted Mosby, architect"". Anything sounds impressive when it's said with the right attitude.",2,How I Met Your Mother,183,28
7823,Marshall,4," Marshall Ericksen. Recently dumped and heading to a lame party. Whoa. Whoa, ladies, please take it easy. There's enough of me for everyone. Oh. Hi. Hello. All right. We're gonna take off..",2,How I Met Your Mother,189,32
7824,Barney,4," Wait up, I'll leave with you guys. ""Ted Mosby, architect"". Trust me.",2,How I Met Your Mother,69,12
7826,Ted,4," Hey, just out of curiosity. If a guy told you he was an architect, what would you think of that?",2,How I Met Your Mother,97,20
7828,Ted,4, Solid point. She did have hair of gold.,2,How I Met Your Mother,40,8
7830,Ted,4, Mm-hmm.,2,How I Met Your Mother,8,1
7832,Robin,4," Hey, Carl, is Ted still here?",2,How I Met Your Mother,30,6
7834,Lily,4, Yes.,2,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
7836,Lily,4," Carl, do you really want to be with a woman who would trade s*x for beer?",2,How I Met Your Mother,74,16
7838,Lily,4, Thanks.,2,How I Met Your Mother,8,1
7839,Robin,4, I wonder where Ted went.,2,How I Met Your Mother,25,5
7841,Robin,4," Actually, yeah. Oh, he is such a cool guy. He was here earlier.",2,How I Met Your Mother,64,13
7844,Ted,4," Well, you know, soul of an artist, hands of a master craftsman. It was inevitable, I guess.",2,How I Met Your Mother,92,17
7846,Ted,4," Well, I could try, but you might end up looking like a midcentury tri-level. Hey, if you want, my friend Marshall invited me to this party we could all go to. Marshall's great. He's just a lawyer, but somebody has to push the paper around for us creative types. Am I right?",2,How I Met Your Mother,274,52
7849,Lily,4," He asked her to a party. Oh, my God, are you okay?",2,How I Met Your Mother,51,12
7850,Robin,4," Okay? It's awesome. It's a win-win. Ted got to vent and I don't have to hear it. Maybe after he's done with the talkie-talk, he'll come over and I'll get the fun part.",2,How I Met Your Mother,168,33
7851,Lily,4," What is wrong with you? God, I feel like I'm teaching love as a second language here. Okay, you know how when he tells you boring work stories you're supposed to listen? Well, when he picks up some random girl at a bar, you're supposed to freak out.",2,How I Met Your Mother,250,48
7852,Robin,4," I'm not freaking out because in my mind, she's fat.",2,How I Met Your Mother,52,10
7854,Robin,4," All right, we'll swing by the party.",2,How I Met Your Mother,37,7
7857,Robin,4," Damn, these are some drunk almost-lawyers.",2,How I Met Your Mother,43,6
7860,Lily,4," Okay, where are the guys and the hooker?",2,How I Met Your Mother,41,8
7862,Robin,4," Hey, drunk legal dude, um... Have you seen Marshall Ericksen? He was with a guy named Ted.",2,How I Met Your Mother,91,17
7865,Ted,4," Awards are nice, they look good on my shelf. But none of that acclaim means anything compared to the joy of seeing the sun rise over your first building.",2,How I Met Your Mother,154,29
7867,Ted,4, I know you would. It's the job.,2,How I Met Your Mother,32,7
7871,Marshall,4," I didn't want to ruin the party for everybody this early, but, uh... everyone take a seat. Um... Lily actually called off the wedding this summer to go to San Francisco. So... We're broken up.",2,How I Met Your Mother,193,35
7873,Marshall,4," Yeah, that's not really the part I was worried about, guys.",2,How I Met Your Mother,60,11
7875,Marshall,4," Guys, can we cease and desist with the lawyer speak for a minute? Love died. The love that made you all believe in love, that's dead now.",2,How I Met Your Mother,138,27
7877,Marshall,4," Uh, really? On what ground, Kara?",2,How I Met Your Mother,34,6
7881,Lily,4, See? Marshall's still hung up on our breakup. Why? Because I listened to him. It was a strong and nurturing relationship that I threw away like old gum.,2,How I Met Your Mother,153,28
7882,Robin,4," Not that I'm worried or anything, but, um, back to the sun rising over Ted and, uh... Oh, what tasteful way did you describe her?",2,How I Met Your Mother,130,25
7884,Robin,4," Yes, that's the young lady.",2,How I Met Your Mother,28,5
7888,Robin,4," Yeah, okay. There is no way Ted went dancing. Ted hates clubs.",2,How I Met Your Mother,63,12
7890,Ted,4," Hell, yeah. I love clubs. I mean, I was going to design a cathedral tonight, kind of take a whack at the whole relationship between God and man conundrum. But sure, let's go dancing.",2,How I Met Your Mother,183,34
7892,Ted,4," Wait, let me just check with my friend.",2,How I Met Your Mother,40,8
7894,Ted,4," Hey, Marshall. You up for some super loud, repetitive music that hasn't changed since the mid-90s?",2,How I Met Your Mother,99,16
7895,Marshall,4, Um... only always.,2,How I Met Your Mother,19,3
7896,Ted,4, Let's go.,2,How I Met Your Mother,10,2
7898,Robin,4," Dancing? He went dancing with this girl? Okay, maybe this is a little bad. Dancing is bad. Dancing leads to s*x.",2,How I Met Your Mother,113,21
7899,Lily,4, Did you grow up in that Footloose town?,2,How I Met Your Mother,40,8
7900,Robin,4," I'm calling him. I'm telling him that I was wrong and I'm sorry, and I totally want to listen to his stupid stories.",2,How I Met Your Mother,117,23
7901,Lily,4," Yeah, think of another way to phrase that and you'll be fine.",2,How I Met Your Mother,62,12
7902,Robin,4, He's not answering. Calling Marshall.,2,How I Met Your Mother,38,5
7905,Marshall,4, Hello.,2,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
7906,Robin,4," Marshall, hi, it's Robin. Can I talk to Ted?",2,How I Met Your Mother,45,9
7907,Marshall,4," Oh, Robin, hi. Um, no, Ted's not here tonight. He's, uh... he's working.",2,How I Met Your Mother,73,13
7908,Robin,4," Uh, okay. Bye.  Marshall just lied. Ted's cheating on me.",2,How I Met Your Mother,58,10
7910,Robin,4," Excuse me. I'm looking for a couple guys who came in here earlier. One's about six-four, 210, sandy brown hair. And the other's a cheating b*st*rd.",2,How I Met Your Mother,148,26
7912,Lily,4," Okay, fella. Baby knows how this game's played. How's a $20 help your memory?",2,How I Met Your Mother,78,14
7914,Lily,4, Then can I have the...? That's cool. You keep that.,2,How I Met Your Mother,52,10
7915,Robin,4, So these guys... One of them's an architect.,2,How I Met Your Mother,45,8
7917,Robin,4, That's the one.,2,How I Met Your Mother,16,3
7920,Ted,4," And then I was all, ""No, Frank Gehry, you're on your own this time."" And that, my dear, was the end of that hack's career.",2,How I Met Your Mother,123,25
7922,Ted,4, That is one hell of a non sequitur.,2,How I Met Your Mother,36,8
7924,Ted,4," Well, I don't know. But I suppose I should at least give you a ride home. Hop on. ",2,How I Met Your Mother,83,18
7928,Marshall,4," Dude, dude, what are you doing?",2,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
7929,Ted,4, Galloping.,2,How I Met Your Mother,11,1
7930,Marshall,4," You proved it, all right? The whole ""Ted Mosby, architect"" things works.",2,How I Met Your Mother,73,12
7932,Marshall,4," Aren't you a little worried that a certain somebody might find out that you're doing this? This isn't you, Ted.",2,How I Met Your Mother,112,20
7933,Ted,4, It is tonight. Whoo!,2,How I Met Your Mother,21,4
7935,Robin,4, You know this girl. Where does she live?,2,How I Met Your Mother,41,8
7937,Lily,4," Well, I'm out of money.",2,How I Met Your Mother,24,5
7938,Robin,4," I'm cashed, too.",2,How I Met Your Mother,17,3
7940,Robin,4, My purse?,2,How I Met Your Mother,10,2
7942,Robin,4," Okay, fine.",2,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
7943,Lily,4, You should tell her that looks really good with a chocolate boot.,2,How I Met Your Mother,66,12
7944,Robin,4, Bitch is lucky I brought my small purse. No room for my gun. Here. Now where does the rodeo slut live?,2,How I Met Your Mother,103,21
7946,Lily,4," Oh, my God, Robin, are you going to kick this girl's ass?",2,How I Met Your Mother,58,12
7947,Robin,4, Yeah... And steal her purse.,2,How I Met Your Mother,29,5
7949,Robin,4," I can't believe he's cheating on me. You know how many times I could have cheated? Six... no seven. And you know two of them, and they would surprise you.",2,How I Met Your Mother,155,30
7950,Lily,4," 3-C, let's do this. You ready?",2,How I Met Your Mother,31,6
7951,Robin,4, Should I just kick the door in?,2,How I Met Your Mother,32,7
7952,Lily,4," Those are really nice heels and you already lost the purse. Let's see if it's unlocked. It's unlocked. Okay, get in there and kick some spankable ass. Robin?",2,How I Met Your Mother,158,28
7953,Robin,4, I'm the problem.,2,How I Met Your Mother,17,3
7954,Lily,4, What?,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
7955,Robin,4, You were right. I don't know how to be a girlfriend. I took the nicest guy in the world and I made him a cheater.,2,How I Met Your Mother,114,25
7956,Lily,4," Well, don't stand out here and beat yourself up. Get in there and beat Ted up. I'll handle the slutty kickboxer. Actually, I'll take Ted.",2,How I Met Your Mother,138,25
7957,Robin,4, Let's do this.,2,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
7958,Lily,4, Bring it. ,2,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
7959,Robin,4, What do you think you're...? Barney?,2,How I Met Your Mother,37,6
7960,Barney,4, Thank God you're here. Can you help with this? I need nails.,2,How I Met Your Mother,61,12
7961,Robin,4," Okay, I'm totally lost here. Where's Ted?",2,How I Met Your Mother,42,7
7962,Barney,4, Ted? He's at work.,2,How I Met Your Mother,19,4
7963,Robin,4, How did you get here?,2,How I Met Your Mother,22,5
7964,Barney,4, Awesome story. As per usual.,2,How I Met Your Mother,29,5
7967,Ted,4, Solid point. And she did have hair of gold.,2,How I Met Your Mother,44,9
7969,Barney,4," Sorry, I forgot my binocs for Foxy Boxing. Whoo, looks like things just got a little foxier right here.",2,How I Met Your Mother,104,19
7970,Ted,4," Yes, they did. And you're just in time. Girls, I got to go, but I'm leaving you in very good, if slightly sullied hands.",2,How I Met Your Mother,121,24
7972,Barney,4," Yeah, stay ",2,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
7973,Ted,4," Excuse us for one second.  Okay, you were right - the architect thing totally works. But I've got a girlfriend and I've got to get back to work. This project is getting harder and harder.",2,How I Met Your Mother,188,35
7974,Barney,4," Yeah, you did.",2,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
7975,Ted,4," Yeah, had to. See ya. ",2,How I Met Your Mother,23,5
7976,Barney,4," Sorry, my, uh... intern had to leave.",2,How I Met Your Mother,38,7
7978,Barney,4, Ted Mosby... Architect.,2,How I Met Your Mother,24,3
7980,Barney,4, But none of that acclaim means anything compared to the joy of seeing the sun rise over your first building.,2,How I Met Your Mother,109,20
7983,Marshall,4," Dude, dude, what are you doing?",2,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
7984,Barney,4, Galloping.,2,How I Met Your Mother,11,1
7985,Marshall,4," All right, you proved it. The whole ""Ted Mosby, architect"" thing works.",2,How I Met Your Mother,72,12
7987,Marshall,4," Aren't you afraid a certain somebody might find out about this? I mean, this isn't you, Ted.",2,How I Met Your Mother,93,17
7988,Barney,4, It is tonight.,2,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
7990,Barney,4," And that led to a couple of hours that I cannot, as a gentleman, divulge to you. We did it right here, and here and here.",2,How I Met Your Mother,122,26
7991,Robin,4, But why would you use Ted's name?,2,How I Met Your Mother,34,7
7992,Barney,4," I've had some recent bad press on the World Wide Web. So I'm taking a T.O. on the whole ""using my real name"" thing.",2,How I Met Your Mother,116,24
7993,Lily,4," Oh, this is great. It wasn't Ted. Everything's okay.",2,How I Met Your Mother,53,9
7994,Robin,4, Everything isn't okay. Look at me. I'm acting crazy and jealous and paranoid.,2,How I Met Your Mother,78,13
7995,Lily,4, This is how people act in relationships.,2,How I Met Your Mother,41,7
7996,Robin,4, And that's why I avoid relationships.,2,How I Met Your Mother,38,6
7997,Lily,4," Well, guess what, I haven't been crazy or jealous or paranoid in months, and I really miss it.",2,How I Met Your Mother,95,18
7998,Barney,4," And thus ended this chapter of, ""Let's pour our hearts out in the bedroom of Barney's one-night stand."" Come on, let's go before she gets out of the shower.",2,How I Met Your Mother,157,29
7999,Robin,4, You're such a pig. You're not even going to say good-bye?,2,How I Met Your Mother,58,11
8000,Barney,4," I'll have you know I composed a lovely form letter for use in just such an occasion. Just fill out her name and then... Something with a ""A."" A... A... I'll just put ""resident."" Go, go, go, go.",2,How I Met Your Mother,194,38
8003,Robin,4, Hey.,2,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
8004,Ted,4, Hey. What are you doing here?,2,How I Met Your Mother,30,6
8005,Robin,4," I brought donuts. And I don't want to brag, but they're filled with jelly.",2,How I Met Your Mother,75,14
8006,Ted,4," Thanks. So, uh... how was your night?",2,How I Met Your Mother,38,7
8007,Robin,4, It was... fine. Nothing exciting. How was yours?,2,How I Met Your Mother,49,8
8008,Ted,4, You really want to hear about boring architect stuff?,2,How I Met Your Mother,54,9
8009,Robin,4," Yes, I do. I'm sorry about earlier. To tell you the truth, I never even saw all of Field of Dreams. I fell asleep half way through.",2,How I Met Your Mother,132,27
8010,Ted,4, What? The best part's the last 20 minutes.,2,How I Met Your Mother,43,8
8011,Robin,4," Well, maybe they should have moved that part up a little bit earlier, 'cause... You know what, um... What I'm trying to say is... I love being the person you bitch to. So how was your day, Mr. Architect?",2,How I Met Your Mother,204,39
8012,Ted,4," Oh, I like the way you say that. Hey, you want to see the building that will make every man in Spokane feel inadequate?",2,How I Met Your Mother,120,24
8013,Robin,4, Obviously. Wow.,2,How I Met Your Mother,16,2
8014,Ted,4, Yes.,2,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
8015,Robin,4," You know, you didn't mention all the foliage around the base. If you trim that back, the rest would look bigger.",2,How I Met Your Mother,113,21
8016,Ted,4," You don't have to tell me. And, um... just for fun, I've... I've sort of been working on my own idea of what I think the building should be. What do you think?",2,How I Met Your Mother,160,33
8018,Robin,4," Wow. Ted, this is amazing.",2,How I Met Your Mother,27,5
8019,Ted,4, Thanks. It's not like it will ever come to anything.,2,How I Met Your Mother,53,10
8020,Robin,4," I don't know. It might come to something. You know, girls find architects very hot. ",2,How I Met Your Mother,85,15
8021,Ted,4," Okay, but I don't want you expecting 78 storeys or anything. ",2,How I Met Your Mother,62,11
8023,Ted,5," Your Uncle Barney was always a bit of an enigma. In all the years we lived in new york, none of us had ever set foot in his apartment. Until one day, one of us did.",2,How I Met Your Mother,165,36
8025,Barney,5, Aaaaaaah!,2,How I Met Your Mother,10,1
8026,Lily,5, Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!,2,How I Met Your Mother,16,1
8027,Ted,5," It's a pretty good story. And believe it or not, alcohol did not play a role. It all started two weeks earlier at Lily's housewarming.",2,How I Met Your Mother,135,25
8029,Lily,5, Welcome to my new home.,2,How I Met Your Mother,24,5
8030,Ted,5," Oh, wow, Lily, this is... Oh, this is all of it.",2,How I Met Your Mother,49,11
8031,Lily,5," Yeah,I know it's small, but it's got character. Thank you. And I am learning Lithuanian from my neighbors. They're great. They're always out there in the hall, you know, cooking and gambling and giving each other haircuts. It's nice.",2,How I Met Your Mother,234,39
8032,Ted,5," Hey,is that a toilet in your kitchen?",2,How I Met Your Mother,38,7
8033,Robin,5, Or a stove in your bathroom?,2,How I Met Your Mother,29,6
8034,Lily,5," Oh, that's not just a stove. That's a stovenkerator",2,How I Met Your Mother,52,9
8035,Ted,5," God,I hope not. Hey, cool murphy bed.",2,How I Met Your Mother,38,7
8036,Lily,5," It's kind of a mess. I didn't make my bed this morning, so...",2,How I Met Your Mother,62,13
8037,Robin,5, Oh! You know what? I bet sleeping at this angle is good for you. For some reason.,2,How I Met Your Mother,82,17
8038,Ted,5," Hold on, I got it.",2,How I Met Your Mother,19,5
8040,Lily,5," That was ""something, something, I am going to something you like a something donkey.",2,How I Met Your Mother,85,14
8041,Robin,5, Uh. Other cultures!,2,How I Met Your Mother,20,3
8042,Lily,5," Hey, let's break out the fruit basket. Hey, who ate all the...?  Aaaaaah!",2,How I Met Your Mother,74,13
8045,Ted,5," Okay, we have to get Lily out of that apartment. Her roommate is a raccoon.",2,How I Met Your Mother,76,15
8046,Robin,5," I'd offer her my place, but I've got dogs and she's allergic.",2,How I Met Your Mother,62,12
8047,Ted,5, Dogs? I live with her ex-boyfriend. I think she's a little more allergic to that.,2,How I Met Your Mother,82,15
8048,Robin,5," What about your place, Barney? I know it's shrouded in mystery, but it's gotta have a couch.",2,How I Met Your Mother,93,17
8049,Barney,5, The fortress of barnitude? No way.,2,How I Met Your Mother,35,6
8050,Robin,5, Come on. She's desperate.,2,How I Met Your Mother,26,4
8051,Barney,5," Hmm, normally a prerequisite for the women I bring home, but... pass.",2,How I Met Your Mother,70,12
8052,Marshall,5," One of you guys is very, very lucky because I have... A boom! An extra ticket to the Alanis Morissette concert. Who's in?",2,How I Met Your Mother,122,23
8053,Robin,5, Absolutely not.,2,How I Met Your Mother,16,2
8054,Ted,5, No.,2,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
8055,Marshall,5," Damn! I got these tickets like months ago for me and Lily and now I can't find anyone to go with me. This is what I miss about being in a couple. I always had someone to go to concerts with, or farmer's market, or brunch. God, I miss brunch!",2,How I Met Your Mother,242,50
8056,Ted,5," Well, I guess you could - well, you could try going to brunch alone.",2,How I Met Your Mother,69,14
8057,Marshall,5," Oh, you don't think I've tried?",2,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
8059,Marshall,5, Table for one.,2,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
8061,Marshall,5," Um, no, just me.",2,How I Met Your Mother,17,4
8063,Marshall,5, You're right. Who am I kidding?,2,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
8065,Robin,5," Oh, the Popover Pantry! That place is great. Can we go get brunch tomorrow?",2,How I Met Your Mother,76,14
8066,Ted,5," Of course, sweetie.",2,How I Met Your Mother,20,3
8067,Marshall,5, Can I go with you guys?,2,How I Met Your Mother,24,6
8068,Ted,5, Really? For brunch?,2,How I Met Your Mother,20,3
8069,Marshall,5," God, I hate being single!",2,How I Met Your Mother,26,5
8071,Lily,5, Ted gave me your spare key.,2,How I Met Your Mother,28,6
8072,Ted,5, Spare key! Brilliant!,2,How I Met Your Mother,22,3
8073,Lily,5," I'm sorry,but you know I'd only come here if I had no other choice. But earlier today, I was getting ready to go to sleep and...",2,How I Met Your Mother,129,26
8074,Lily,5, Sveikas ,2,How I Met Your Mother,9,1
8076,Barney,5," That's terrible. Well, see ya.",2,How I Met Your Mother,31,5
8077,Lily,5," Wait, can I stay here maybe?",2,How I Met Your Mother,29,6
8078,Barney,5," I'd let you, but I don't have any room.",2,How I Met Your Mother,40,9
8079,Lily,5, You live in a two-bedroom apartment. You have one room just for your suits.,2,How I Met Your Mother,76,14
8080,Barney,5," Hey I'm at a point in my life where my suits are my family. Look around you Lily. You are in the heart of bachelor country, and as a woman, you are an illegal immigrant here. Now,you can try to apply for a s*x visa, but that only lasts 12 hours. 14 if you qualify for multiple entry.",2,How I Met Your Mother,284,58
8081,Lily,5," Ewww!...Is something some lame, judgmental chick would say, but I say give me multiple high fives.",2,How I Met Your Mother,99,16
8082,Barney,5," Wow, you really are desperate.",2,How I Met Your Mother,31,5
8083,Lily,5, I really am.,2,How I Met Your Mother,13,3
8084,Barney,5," Oh okay, you can stay here for two days. But I only have one rule. You can't change anything.",2,How I Met Your Mother,94,19
8085,Lily,5, Why would I change anything? This place is... Perfect. Except for the fact that you don't have a TV.,2,How I Met Your Mother,101,19
8086,Barney,5," See that wall? 300-inch flat-screen. They only sell them in Japan, but I know a guy. Had to ship it over in a tugboat like freakin' King Kong.",2,How I Met Your Mother,143,28
8087,Lily,5, It hurts my eyes.,2,How I Met Your Mother,18,4
8088,Barney,5, Yeah. That doesn't go away.,2,How I Met Your Mother,28,5
8090,Ted,5," Hey, where have you been?",2,How I Met Your Mother,26,5
8091,Marshall,5, The Alanis Morissette concert.,2,How I Met Your Mother,31,4
8092,Ted,5, By yourself?,2,How I Met Your Mother,13,2
8093,Marshall,5," No,actually I went with a friend from law school.",2,How I Met Your Mother,50,9
8094,Robin,5," Oh,really? Who's this friend?",2,How I Met Your Mother,30,4
8095,Marshall,5, Brad.,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
8098,Marshall,5, Totally! I can't believe I almost didn't come tonight.,2,How I Met Your Mother,55,9
8100,Marshall,5," Yeah, how'd you know?",2,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
8102,Marshall,5," What? Kara broke up with you? I'm sorry,man. That sucks. Brad,do you like brunch?",2,How I Met Your Mother,82,14
8104,Ted,5, You invited him to brunch?,2,How I Met Your Mother,27,5
8105,Marshall,5," Yeah, I invited him to brunch. Why? Is that weird?",2,How I Met Your Mother,51,10
8106,Ted,5," Yes. That's why I was all ""you invited him to brunch?""",2,How I Met Your Mother,55,11
8107,Marshall,5, Why can't two guys who are friends go to brunch?,2,How I Met Your Mother,49,10
8108,Ted,5, Because brunch is kind of...,2,How I Met Your Mother,29,5
8109,Robin,5, Girly.,2,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
8110,Marshall,5, Girly? Breakfast isn't girly. Lunch isn't girly. What makes brunch girly?,2,How I Met Your Mother,74,11
8111,Ted,5," I don't know. There's nothing girly about a horse, nothing girly about a horn, but put them together and you get a unicorn.",2,How I Met Your Mother,124,23
8112,Marshall,5," I don't care what either of you say, I am going to the Popover Pantry with Brad. We're here. We're hungry. Get used to it, brunch.",2,How I Met Your Mother,131,26
8114,Barney,5," Uhm, smells delicious.",2,How I Met Your Mother,23,3
8115,Lily,5," Thank you. There was no food in the fridge, so I picked up...  What are you doing?",2,How I Met Your Mother,83,17
8116,Barney,5," Lily, what was the first rule again?",2,How I Met Your Mother,37,7
8117,Lily,5," ""Don't change anything""?",2,How I Met Your Mother,25,3
8118,Barney,5, And what was the second rule?,2,How I Met Your Mother,30,6
8119,Lily,5, There was no second rule.,2,How I Met Your Mother,26,5
8120,Barney,5, Exactly! There was only one rule and you broke it.,2,How I Met Your Mother,51,10
8121,Lily,5, I bought groceries. That counts as changing something?,2,How I Met Your Mother,55,8
8122,Barney,5," Lily, if I wanted a fridge full of groceries or fresh coffee in the morning, I'd be in a relationship. But I don't want to be in a relationship. That's why I make it crystal-clear to every girl that walks through that door that this is not a place to leave a toothbrush. This is not a place to leave a contact lens case. This is a place to leave. Come on, 'll give you a tour. Uh, no flash photography please. Bienvenido to the bedroom. Dig this",2,How I Met Your Mother,446,88
8123,Lily,5, Marshall doesn't have p0rn.,2,How I Met Your Mother,28,4
8124,Barney,5," Aww, that's sweet. While guys like Ted and Marshall may hide their p0rn, I had mine professionally lit. Girls see this, they can't get out of here fast enough.",2,How I Met Your Mother,160,29
8125,Lily,5," And if that doesn't drive them away, there's always your life-sized storm-trooper.",2,How I Met Your Mother,83,12
8126,Barney,5," No,that's just awesome. So you see, whenever a girl wakes up here, I never have to tell her to go build her nest somewhere else. My apartment does it for me.",2,How I Met Your Mother,158,31
8128,Marshall,5," God, I love brunch.",2,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
8130,Marshall,5," This isn't weird, right?",2,How I Met Your Mother,25,4
8132,Marshall,5, Right? Right?,2,How I Met Your Mother,14,2
8134,Marshall,5," Exactly. Thank you, that's exactly what I've been saying.",2,How I Met Your Mother,58,9
8136,Marshall,5, What are you talking about?,2,How I Met Your Mother,28,5
8138,Marshall,5, Yeah!,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
8140,Barney,5, Hey. Did the cold wake you?,2,How I Met Your Mother,28,6
8142,Barney,5," Oh,did you try and take a shower? I'm sorry, I only have one clean towel.",2,How I Met Your Mother,74,15
8144,Barney,5," Okay. I'd offer you some coffee, but I don't have any, so you're gonna have to...",2,How I Met Your Mother,82,16
8146,Barney,5," I think I left something on the bookshelf. Whoops. Oh, no, oh, look  Oh, I'm disgusting.",2,How I Met Your Mother,89,16
8148,Barney,5," Whoa, uh, okay. Beep beep. Backing up, um...",2,How I Met Your Mother,45,8
8149,Lily,5, Barney... Oh!,2,How I Met Your Mother,14,2
8151,Barney,5, What? No. Yes!,2,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
8153,Barney,5, Yes.,2,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
8155,Barney,5," Come on, baby. please, no. You don't understand. What have I done? This is the worst. How could you...?  You're not going anywhere. Live claritin clear. Wow, that was close. That hippie chick wouldn't leave. She was ready to squat here.",2,How I Met Your Mother,237,41
8156,Lily,5," Well, she'd have to with your spring-loaded toilet seat, wouldn't she?",2,How I Met Your Mother,71,11
8157,Barney,5, She was freakishly immune to everything in my apartment... Except you. You're better than p0rn.,2,How I Met Your Mother,96,15
8158,Lily,5, Thank you.,2,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
8159,Barney,5," How would you like to extend your stay here? All you'd have to do is pretend to be my wife, and scare off the occasional one-night stand. I know,I know. You've got your ethics. You've got your principles...",2,How I Met Your Mother,207,38
8160,Lily,5, I'll do it.,2,How I Met Your Mother,12,3
8161,Barney,5, Really?,2,How I Met Your Mother,8,1
8162,Lily,5," Barney,you've clearly got some serious mother issues that have left you the emotional equivalent of a scavenging sewer rat. But, in my other apartment, I would be living with an actual scavenging sewer rat, so you win.",2,How I Met Your Mother,219,37
8163,Barney,5, I'll take it.,2,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
8166,Ted,5, Mamma mia!?,2,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
8167,Marshall,5," Mamma mia!. You know what? It's supposed to be a great musical, okay? It won all sorts of Tonies and stuff.",2,How I Met Your Mother,108,21
8168,Ted,5," No, totally. It sounds like a really, really fun, exciting, third date.",2,How I Met Your Mother,72,12
8169,Robin,5," Ooh, third date. You know what that means.",2,How I Met Your Mother,43,8
8170,Marshall,5," It is not a date,okay. It's just two bros taking in a Broadway show.",2,How I Met Your Mother,69,14
8171,Ted,5, You bros going to get dinner beforehand?,2,How I Met Your Mother,41,7
8172,Marshall,5," We might grab a steak, yeah.",2,How I Met Your Mother,29,6
8173,Ted,5, Where at?,2,How I Met Your Mother,10,2
8174,Marshall,5," Cafí© l'amour.  Brad says the food is really good there, okay?",2,How I Met Your Mother,63,11
8175,Robin,5," Sounds like Brad's got quite the night planned out. You better bring your ""A"" game. That means no granny panties.",2,How I Met Your Mother,114,20
8176,Marshall,5," All right, you know what? You two are just threatened because I'm a single guy moving in on your couples' stuff. Well, guess what? It's my territory now. I'm peeing all over brunches, fancy dinners and musicals. That's right. Brad and I are taking back Broadway.",2,How I Met Your Mother,263,46
8177,Ted,5, What are you going to wear?,2,How I Met Your Mother,28,6
8178,Marshall,5," I was thinking like this collared shirt and these pin...  Oh, you know what? Shut up.",2,How I Met Your Mother,86,16
8180,Barney,5, Can you pass the arts and leisure?  Can you pass the arts and leisure?,2,How I Met Your Mother,71,14
8182,Lily,5," Honey, I'm... Barney, what the hell is going on here?",2,How I Met Your Mother,54,10
8183,Barney,5," Lily, I can explain...",2,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
8184,Lily,5, How could you? In our own home?  You b*st*rd!,2,How I Met Your Mother,46,9
8186,Lily,5, Just get out. This is what I get after I worked as a stripper for four years to put you through medical school? I got breast implants for you. I...  I was just about to turn on the tears.,2,How I Met Your Mother,188,39
8187,Barney,5, Brava. That was incredible. And that slap was genius. You did not hold back.,2,How I Met Your Mother,77,14
8188,Lily,5," Yeah, that I just always wanted to do.",2,How I Met Your Mother,39,8
8189,Barney,5," Fair enough. I have to say, it's kind of nice having food around here for a change.",2,How I Met Your Mother,84,17
8190,Lily,5," You know... Oh nah, never mind.",2,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
8191,Barney,5, What? You're my wife. You can tell me anything.,2,How I Met Your Mother,48,9
8192,Lily,5," Well,if you really wanted to sell this ruse, we should try to make this place a little more... You know, homey. Like... Like a woman would actually live here.",2,How I Met Your Mother,159,29
8193,Barney,5, What did you have in mind?,2,How I Met Your Mother,27,6
8196,Ted,5," Hey,you're home. I didn't think we'd be seeing you until tomorrow morning.",2,How I Met Your Mother,75,12
8197,Marshall,5," Ha,ha,ha,ha. It wasn't a date. Okay, it was a date and it got way weird.",2,How I Met Your Mother,73,15
8199,Marshall,5," Oh, you really don't have to do that.",2,How I Met Your Mother,38,8
8201,Marshall,5," Thanks, Brad.",2,How I Met Your Mother,14,2
8204,Ted,5, Woah!,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
8205,Robin,5," Well, it could have been worse. It could have fallen in your lap.",2,How I Met Your Mother,66,13
8206,Marshall,5, It gets worse.,2,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
8208,Marshall,5," No, I can do it, Brad. Okay,thank you.",2,How I Met Your Mother,39,8
8210,Marshall,5, You want me to go to a wedding with you?,2,How I Met Your Mother,41,10
8212,Ted,5," Okay, that's not too bad. Two single guys on the prowl. It'll be like ""Wedding crashers"".",2,How I Met Your Mother,90,16
8213,Robin,5, Just keep Brad away from the bouquet.,2,How I Met Your Mother,38,7
8214,Marshall,5, It gets worse.,2,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
8217,Marshall,5, Vermont?,2,How I Met Your Mother,9,1
8220,Ted,5," You said no, right?",2,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
8221,Marshall,5, Of course.,2,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
8224,Marshall,5, I'll go to Vermont with you.,2,How I Met Your Mother,29,6
8228,Ted,5, I'm sorry. It's not funny anymore.,2,How I Met Your Mother,35,6
8229,Marshall,5," Damn you,brunch! This guy's crazy, right?",2,How I Met Your Mother,42,6
8230,Ted,5," Look,I don't think he's crazy. I just think he's suffering from a severe case of girlfriend withdrawal. And unfortunately, you're his nicotine patch.",2,How I Met Your Mother,150,23
8231,Robin,5, And now you have to do what every dysfunctional couple has to do,2,How I Met Your Mother,65,13
8232,Marshall,5," You're right. You're right. I promised brad I would go to the wedding with him,and then that is it.",2,How I Met Your Mother,100,19
8233,Ted,5, Good man.,2,How I Met Your Mother,10,2
8235,Lily,5," Oh,I think we made the right decision going for the custom-made italian sheets.",2,How I Met Your Mother,80,13
8236,Barney,5," Hey, if my bed's going suit up, it's going to do it right. Want to give it a whirl?",2,How I Met Your Mother,84,19
8237,Lily,5, Oh. Ooooh!,2,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
8238,Barney,5," All right, I'm going to head out, hit the bars. What are you going to do tonight?",2,How I Met Your Mother,82,17
8239,Lily,5," Oh, I was just going to watch ""Letterman"" but, God this bed is so comfy. I wish you had a TV in here.  Okay, seriously, what do you do for a living?",2,How I Met Your Mother,149,32
8240,Barney,5, Please. ,2,How I Met Your Mother,9,1
8241,Lily,5, I thought you were going out.,2,How I Met Your Mother,30,6
8242,Barney,5, Eh. After the monologue.,2,How I Met Your Mother,25,4
8243,Ted,5," The next morning, as the sun rose over Manhattan, your Uncle Marshall headed over to Brad's apartment to leave for the wedding in Vermont. But when he got there...",2,How I Met Your Mother,164,29
8245,Marshall,5," No. No... No. No! No!  Ted. Um, Brad got me flowers.",2,How I Met Your Mother,53,11
8246,Ted,5, Hold on.  Brad got him flowers.  I'm sorry. It just got funny again. ,2,How I Met Your Mother,70,13
8248,Marshall,5," No, Brad, uh, I don't want to hear it. I do like you. And calla lilies are my favorite flower. I don't know how you knew that. I guess you just get me, but this is not cool, man. I can't believe that you would...",2,How I Met Your Mother,213,45
8253,Marshall,5," Hi, Kara. So you guys,are like back together now?",2,How I Met Your Mother,50,9
8255,Marshall,5," Yeah, you should have.",2,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
8257,Marshall,5," Don't, Brad. Just don't. ",2,How I Met Your Mother,26,4
8261,Barney,5, Aaaaaah!,2,How I Met Your Mother,9,1
8262,Lily,5, Aaaaaaaaaaah!,2,How I Met Your Mother,14,1
8263,Barney,5, I can't believe we just... You and I... What have we done?,2,How I Met Your Mother,59,12
8264,Lily,5, Nothing. Nothing happened. We... We just went to sleep.,2,How I Met Your Mother,56,9
8265,Barney,5," ""Just went to sleep""? I don't sleep in the same bed as a woman and not make a move. How could... You! You spooned me against my will.",2,How I Met Your Mother,134,28
8266,Lily,5," Hey,it takes two to cuddle.",2,How I Met Your Mother,28,5
8267,Barney,5," We... We redecorated my place. We stayed in on a friday night to watch ""Letterman"", and then slept together and didn't have s*x? Oh my God! We're in a relationship!",2,How I Met Your Mother,165,30
8268,Lily,5, That's what you think a relationship is?,2,How I Met Your Mother,41,7
8269,Barney,5," You were supposed to be the vaccine, but you gave me the disease. You gotta go.",2,How I Met Your Mother,80,16
8270,Lily,5," Barney. I don't think you're mad at me. You're mad at yourself. You let down your guard, and let someone into your life, and... And it actually felt okay. And that terrifies you.",2,How I Met Your Mother,179,33
8271,Barney,5, Uh-uh. You gotta go.,2,How I Met Your Mother,21,4
8272,Lily,5," Hey, you can't just kick me out! I put a lot of work into this place, and I've grown accustomed to a certain standard of living.",2,How I Met Your Mother,129,26
8273,Barney,5," ""A certain standard of living""? You didn't pay a single...",2,How I Met Your Mother,59,10
8274,Ted,5," And so Mr. and Mrs. Stinson, after two weeks of marriage, decided to call it quits. Fortunately, they reached a settlement. And that's the story of how Aunt Lily furnished her apartment.",2,How I Met Your Mother,187,32
8275,Ted,5, Marshall ran into Brad again some time later.,2,How I Met Your Mother,46,8
8276,Marshall,5," Oh my God, it's Brad. Laugh like I said something really funny. ",2,How I Met Your Mother,65,12
8277,Ted,5, That was great.,2,How I Met Your Mother,16,3
8278,Marshall,5, Right? Right?,2,How I Met Your Mother,14,2
8280,Marshall,5," Oh, hey, hey, how's it going?",2,How I Met Your Mother,30,6
8282,Ted,5," Yeah, I know who you are.",2,How I Met Your Mother,26,6
8284,Marshall,5," Yeah, me too, but more important.",2,How I Met Your Mother,34,6
8286,Marshall,5," Sure. Sure.  Even if you don't believe it, tell me he looks fat.",2,How I Met Your Mother,65,13
8289,Lily,6, It's just that all I've ever done is teach kindergarten. I want to get out there and change the world. I want to find my passion.,2,How I Met Your Mother,130,26
8291,Lily,6, I'm going to be a life coach.,2,How I Met Your Mother,30,7
8293,Lily,6, I'm going to be a marine biologist... Slam poet... Beekeeper! Not a beekeeper.,2,How I Met Your Mother,79,13
8294,Robin,6, Her newest lifelong dream? Singing in a punk rock band.,2,How I Met Your Mother,56,10
8295,Ted,6, What is she doing for money through all this?,2,How I Met Your Mother,46,9
8296,Robin,6," Oh, she's been waiting tables at Big Wave Luau.",2,How I Met Your Mother,48,9
8297,Ted,6," Wait, you mean that hawaiian place where they wear those embarrassing outfits?",2,How I Met Your Mother,79,12
8298,Robin,6, No.,2,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
8300,Marshall,6, Here she comes. Here she comes.,2,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
8301,Lily,6," Welcome to big Wave Luau. Can I tiki your drink order? Aw, crap.",2,How I Met Your Mother,65,13
8302,Robin,6, I'm sorry.,2,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
8303,Barney,6," Oh, hi, Lily. We were just in the neighborhood, thought we'd get some lunch. We didn't even know you'd be here. .",2,How I Met Your Mother,114,22
8304,Lily,6, What do you want?,2,How I Met Your Mother,18,4
8305,Ted,6, I don't think that's how you're supposed to greet a customer at Big Wave Luau.,2,How I Met Your Mother,79,15
8306,Lily,6," Aloha, island visitors. The big wave brought you to our humble luau. For that, we thank you. Or in my native tongue, mahalo.",2,How I Met Your Mother,125,23
8307,Barney,6, I didn't catch your name. Did you guys catch her name?,2,How I Met Your Mother,55,11
8308,Ted,6, No.,2,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
8309,Lily,6," My name is Anuhea. It means cool and fragrant,much like any of our 12 specialty drinks.",2,How I Met Your Mother,88,16
8310,Ted,6," Robin, nothing to add?",2,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
8311,Robin,6, No. Lily is my friend and I'm not going to make fun of her for trying to follow her dreams.,2,How I Met Your Mother,92,20
8312,Lily,6, Thank you.,2,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
8313,Robin,6," Although, you might want to bring out the big hawaiian drum because I'm pretty sure today's my birthday.",2,How I Met Your Mother,105,18
8316,Marshall,6, I've never need the beer more than I do right now.,2,How I Met Your Mother,51,11
8317,Ted,6," I thought you said your semester was gonna be a piece of cake. I remember because you were eating a piece of cake at the time and you said, ""dude, my semester is gonna be this.""",2,How I Met Your Mother,178,36
8318,Marshall,6," Yeah, well, it was supposed to be, but my professor's like the toughest grader I've ever seen. She had like a bad divorce this summer and now she's taking it out on us. To tell you the truth, I think she just needs to get laid.",2,How I Met Your Mother,228,46
8319,Barney,6," Really? Laid, you say?",2,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
8320,Marshall,6," You wouldn't be into her.She's, like, in her late 40s.",2,How I Met Your Mother,55,10
8321,Barney,6, She hot?,2,How I Met Your Mother,9,2
8322,Marshall,6," Yeah, I guess she's kind of hot, yeah.",2,How I Met Your Mother,39,8
8323,Barney,6, And she's looking for some action. Sounds to me like she could be a cougar.,2,How I Met Your Mother,76,15
8324,Robin,6, A what?,2,How I Met Your Mother,8,2
8325,Barney,6," A cougar. An older woman, usually in her 40s or 50s, single and on the prowl for a younger man.",2,How I Met Your Mother,96,20
8326,Ted,6, What's a woman in her 60s or 70s? A turtle?,2,How I Met Your Mother,44,10
8327,Barney,6," Marshall, I've thought it over and I accept your challenge.",2,How I Met Your Mother,60,10
8328,Marshall,6, I didn't challenge you to have s*x with...,2,How I Met Your Mother,43,8
8329,Barney,6," Tomorrow, the cougar hunt begins.",2,How I Met Your Mother,34,5
8330,Lily,6," So, I quit my job. I just couldn't take it anymore. Approximately 50 times a day, some guy asks me for a lei...",2,How I Met Your Mother,112,23
8331,Marshall,6, Classic.,2,How I Met Your Mother,9,1
8332,Robin,6," Ted, didn't you tell me they need a new assistant in your office?",2,How I Met Your Mother,66,13
8333,Ted,6, Yeah. Somebody did just quit.,2,How I Met Your Mother,30,5
8335,Ted,6," So, where should we eat today?  Oh awesome, you brought lunch for everyone? ",2,How I Met Your Mother,77,13
8337,Marshall,6," Dude, that is cold-blooded.",2,How I Met Your Mother,28,4
8338,Ted,6," It was an honest mistake. Look, when somebody opens up a container with an entire chicken in it, it's okay to assume they made lunch for everyone.",2,How I Met Your Mother,147,27
8339,Robin,6," Ted, that girl didn't quit. You destroyed her.",2,How I Met Your Mother,47,8
8340,Ted,6, It was an whole chicken. And did I mention she had 12 sides?,2,How I Met Your Mother,61,13
8341,Barney,6," Oh, now you're gonna bash her figure. Real classy, Ted.",2,How I Met Your Mother,56,10
8342,Ted,6," So, Lily, what do you say? Do you want the job?",2,How I Met Your Mother,48,11
8343,Lily,6, What would I be doing?,2,How I Met Your Mother,23,5
8344,Ted,6," Basically, you're sort of a general office assistant.",2,How I Met Your Mother,54,8
8346,Ted,6, You'll sit there. My station is right over here. And things are a little bit crazy right now 'cause we're pitching a new building to a big client.,2,How I Met Your Mother,147,28
8347,Lily,6," Oh, right, is that the...?",2,How I Met Your Mother,27,5
8348,Ted,6, Yeah. Here's the model.,2,How I Met Your Mother,24,4
8349,Lily,6, You weren't kidding. It really does look like a giant pen1s.,2,How I Met Your Mother,61,11
8350,Ted,6," I know. For whatever reason, Mr. Druthers just doesn't see it.",2,How I Met Your Mother,63,11
8351,Lily,6, How can he not see it? I mean there's the...,2,How I Met Your Mother,45,10
8352,Ted,6, I know.,2,How I Met Your Mother,8,2
8353,Lily,6, And the way it...,2,How I Met Your Mother,18,4
8354,Ted,6, I know.,2,How I Met Your Mother,8,2
8355,Lily,6, And the two little...,2,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
8356,Ted,6, I know.,2,How I Met Your Mother,8,2
8357,Lily,6, It is just...,2,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
8359,Ted,6," Lily, this is Mr. Druthers, the head architect on the project. Lily's going to be our new office assistant.",2,How I Met Your Mother,108,19
8361,Lily,6, Nice to meet you.,2,How I Met Your Mother,18,4
8363,Ted,6," I, uh... I am an architect.",2,How I Met Your Mother,28,6
8365,Ted,6," Well, not unless he somehow passed all his licensing exams.",2,How I Met Your Mother,60,10
8367,Ted,6, Absolutely.,2,How I Met Your Mother,12,1
8369,Ted,6, Styrofoam trees.,2,How I Met Your Mother,17,2
8371,Ted,6, Styrofoam trees.,2,How I Met Your Mother,17,2
8373,Ted,6, Styrofoam trees!,2,How I Met Your Mother,17,2
8375,Lily,6," Man, that guy is a total, well... ",2,How I Met Your Mother,35,7
8377,Marshall,6," Okay, wait, wait, wait. That's professor Lewis's office there.",2,How I Met Your Mother,63,9
8378,Barney,6," Okay, let's take a look. Oh, yeah, it's a cougar all right. A prime specimen. See, you can identify a cougar by a few key characteristics. Start with the hair. The cougar keeps up with current hairstyles as a form of camouflage. The prey may not realize that he's engaged a cougar until he's already being dragged, helpless, back to her lair. Now, the blouse. The cougar displays maximum cleavage possible to captivate her prey. If you're watching them bounce, she's about to pounce. See the claws? Long and sharp, to ward off rival females... Or open alimony checks. Yeah, this one's a beaut. Okay, let the hunt begin.",2,How I Met Your Mother,620,109
8379,Marshall,6," Wait, wait, wait.I'm not so sure I'm comfortable with you hunting my constitutional law professor.",2,How I Met Your Mother,99,15
8380,Barney,6, Who do you rather have grading your papers,2,How I Met Your Mother,43,8
8381,Marshall,6," Go, Barney. Go mount and stuff that cougar.",2,How I Met Your Mother,44,8
8382,Barney,6," Scusi, I am Luigi, italian exchange student. I was, uh, walking to class, but then I noticed you... Bella principessa...",2,How I Met Your Mother,121,20
8384,Barney,6, Direct. I like that. The name's Barney. What I want... is you.,2,How I Met Your Mother,63,12
8387,Lily,6, I can't believe how Mr. Druthers treats people. And that building? Talk about overcompensating.,2,How I Met Your Mother,96,14
8388,Ted,6," He's not usually this bad. It's just that the partners have made it very clear this project is make or break for us, so lately he's been a little testy.  You know what I mean",2,How I Met Your Mother,175,35
8389,Robin,6, Did you show lily your design?,2,How I Met Your Mother,31,6
8390,Ted,6, No.,2,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
8391,Lily,6, What design?,2,How I Met Your Mother,13,2
8392,Ted,6, It's nothing.,2,How I Met Your Mother,14,2
8393,Robin,6," It's fantastic. Just for fun, Ted's been working on his own design. And it doesn't look at all like male genitalia. At least, not healthy male genitalia.",2,How I Met Your Mother,154,27
8394,Lily,6," Ted, you should pitch your building to Druthers.",2,How I Met Your Mother,49,8
8395,Ted,6," Are you kidding? He's Hammond Druthers. He's a legend. I'm just part of his team. This building is huge for the firm, so it's really important we don't blow it.  All right, enough!",2,How I Met Your Mother,181,33
8397,Barney,6," Oh, my god. Incredible.",2,How I Met Your Mother,24,4
8399,Barney,6, C minus? What are you talking about? I just pulled an all-nighter!,2,How I Met Your Mother,67,12
8402,Lily,6, Mr. Druthers asked if you were making the trees or waiting for them to sprout on their own. Then he stared at me until I laughed.,2,How I Met Your Mother,130,26
8403,Ted,6," Okay, I'm done.",2,How I Met Your Mother,16,3
8404,Lily,6, Great. I'll put the paints away. You just go show him.,2,How I Met Your Mother,55,11
8405,Ted,6, Great. Thanks.,2,How I Met Your Mother,15,2
8407,Ted,6," Good one, sir. Anyway, here they are.",2,How I Met Your Mother,38,7
8409,Ted,6, Too green?,2,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
8411,Ted,6, I can't un-picture it.,2,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
8413,Ted,6, What? What's gone?,2,How I Met Your Mother,19,3
8415,Ted,6," Well, it's got to be around here somewhere.",2,How I Met Your Mother,44,8
8417,Ted,6," Well, um, I better get back to these styrofoam trees.",2,How I Met Your Mother,54,10
8419,Ted,6," Inspiring as always, sir. Lily? Where's she put those paints? ",2,How I Met Your Mother,63,10
8422,Lily,6, Hey.,2,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
8423,Ted,6," Hey. Um, Lily, question for you. Why did I find Mr. Druthers' baseball signed three times by Pete Rose in your desk drawer?",2,How I Met Your Mother,124,23
8424,Lily,6, That's easy. I took it.,2,How I Met Your Mother,24,5
8425,Ted,6, Why?,2,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
8426,Lily,6, It's simple.,2,How I Met Your Mother,13,2
8431,Lily,6," Okay, I may have exaggerated that last one, but the point is, he was mean. And that's why I took away his ball.",2,How I Met Your Mother,112,23
8432,Ted,6, What does his ball have to do with anything?,2,How I Met Your Mother,45,9
8433,Lily,6," Druthers has to be taught he can't behave like that. When I was teaching kindergarten,whenever a kid was mean, I would take away one of his toys. The kid would be upset at first,but then he'd learn to stop being mean.",2,How I Met Your Mother,218,41
8434,Robin,6," Hey, guys. What's going on?",2,How I Met Your Mother,28,5
8435,Ted,6, Lily stole my boss' baseball signed three times by Pete Rose.,2,How I Met Your Mother,62,11
8436,Robin,6, Why? Was he being mean?,2,How I Met Your Mother,24,5
8437,Ted,6, You know about this?,2,How I Met Your Mother,21,4
8438,Robin,6, Yeah. It's her own personal form of justice. Did you tell him about that time at the Gap?,2,How I Met Your Mother,90,18
8439,Lily,6," Oh, that was a good one. This sales guy was rude to Robin, so I took a pair of khakis.",2,How I Met Your Mother,87,20
8440,Robin,6, I gave them to you for your birthday.,2,How I Met Your Mother,38,8
8441,Ted,6, So I've been walking around in stolen khakis?,2,How I Met Your Mother,46,8
8442,Lily,6," I prefer to call them ""justice khakis.""",2,How I Met Your Mother,40,7
8443,Ted,6," That's not justice. It's shoplifting,and it's a crime.",2,How I Met Your Mother,55,8
8444,Lily,6, So is being mean.,2,How I Met Your Mother,18,4
8445,Ted,6," Lily, your little system doesn't even make sense. In kindergarten, the kid knew why he was being punished. Druthers just thinks someone stole his ball.",2,How I Met Your Mother,152,25
8446,Lily,6," Well, that's why I left a note.",2,How I Met Your Mother,32,7
8447,Ted,6, A note?,2,How I Met Your Mother,8,2
8448,Lily,6," Yeah. When he finds it, he'll understand why his ball was taken away, he'll stop being mean, and the office will be a nicer place to work. Maybe he'll even be open to hearing your ideas.",2,How I Met Your Mother,187,36
8449,Ted,6," Look, Lil, we're all tolerating this prolonged nervous breakdown you're clearly having, with the punk band and the beekeeping and the petty larceny, but this is my career you're messing with.",2,How I Met Your Mother,192,31
8450,Lily,6, I'm not sure I like your tone. You know what? Now you just lost the ball.,2,How I Met Your Mother,74,16
8452,Marshall,6," I'd ask you how last night went, but we had a pop quiz today. Nobody got higher than a c-minus.",2,How I Met Your Mother,96,20
8453,Barney,6," I know, I know.",2,How I Met Your Mother,16,4
8454,Marshall,6, You claim to have so much s*x. I only assumed you'd be good at it.,2,How I Met Your Mother,67,15
8455,Barney,6," Look, I miscalculated. I thought she'd be old and fragile, like most cougars. But kitty's got claws. Don't worry though. Tonight, I'm seeing her again.",2,How I Met Your Mother,152,25
8456,Marshall,6," Just let it go, man. You're making things worse.",2,How I Met Your Mother,49,9
8457,Barney,6," I promise you, after tonight, that cougar will be my pet, and I its master.",2,How I Met Your Mother,76,15
8459,Barney,6, I think I'm falling in love with you.,2,How I Met Your Mother,38,8
8461,Barney,6, What? No.We had s*x yesterday.,2,How I Met Your Mother,31,5
8464,Ted,6," When Druthers goes to get his bagel, I'll go in, grab the note, put the ball back. If something goes wrong, yell out, ""who wants espresso?"" So I'll know he's coming. Got it? Okay, now give me the ball.",2,How I Met Your Mother,202,39
8465,Lily,6, No.,2,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
8466,Ted,6," What do you mean, no?",2,How I Met Your Mother,22,5
8467,Lily,6," I mean I stand by what I did, Ted.",2,How I Met Your Mother,35,9
8468,Ted,6," Come on, Lily. We're running out of time.",2,How I Met Your Mother,42,8
8470,Lily,6," ""Who wants espresso?""",2,How I Met Your Mother,22,3
8473,Lily,6, Interesting.,2,How I Met Your Mother,13,1
8475,Lily,6," Wow. Looks like bye-bye, iPod.",2,How I Met Your Mother,31,5
8476,Ted,6, Give him his ball back right now. People are going to get fired.,2,How I Met Your Mother,65,13
8477,Lily,6," No, they're not. It's just a tantrum, Ted. I saw this in kindergarten all the time.",2,How I Met Your Mother,84,16
8478,Ted,6," This isn't kindergarten. Mr Druthers is an adult, and he wants his ball back.",2,How I Met Your Mother,78,14
8479,Lily,6," All right, I'll give it back if you show him your plans.",2,How I Met Your Mother,57,12
8480,Ted,6, No. You'll give it back or you're fired.,2,How I Met Your Mother,41,8
8481,Lily,6," I'm sorry, Ted. I just can't do that.",2,How I Met Your Mother,38,8
8482,Ted,6, Then you're fired.,2,How I Met Your Mother,19,3
8483,Lily,6, Fine. Here's the ball. At least you have one now.,2,How I Met Your Mother,50,10
8485,Marshall,6," Dude, you're killing me. You didn't tame the cougar. You just made her angrier.",2,How I Met Your Mother,80,14
8486,Barney,6, Do you not see the powerbar in my hand? I'm fueling up.,2,How I Met Your Mother,56,12
8487,Marshall,6, So you're going back over there?,2,How I Met Your Mother,33,6
8488,Barney,6," Oh, yeah. And tonight, just like John Mellencamp, I am going to get rid of the ""cougar"" once and for all. Get it? 'Cause that's what he did with his name.",2,How I Met Your Mother,155,31
8490,Barney,6, I can't stop thinking about you. Please give me another chance.,2,How I Met Your Mother,64,11
8492,Barney,6," But you don't understand. See, I've been going easy on you, holding back, 'cause I was afraid you'd break a hip or something. But, this time, no mercy.I don't care how long it takes days, weeks, half a year.",2,How I Met Your Mother,208,39
8496,Ted,6," Mr. Druthers, thank you again for understanding about Lily.",2,How I Met Your Mother,60,9
8498,Ted,6, Lily was mentally deranged.,2,How I Met Your Mother,28,4
8500,Ted,6, Lily was mentally deranged!,2,How I Met Your Mother,28,4
8512,Ted,6, Wait! We have one more idea for you.,2,How I Met Your Mother,37,8
8514,Ted,6, I have another design.,2,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
8516,Ted,6, No.,2,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
8518,Robin,6, To Ted! The youngest person to ever design a building over 70 stories... Probably!,2,How I Met Your Mother,83,14
8520,Lily,6," Congrats, ted.",2,How I Met Your Mother,15,2
8521,Ted,6," Hey, thanks for telling me to stand up to Druthers and pitch my idea. Seriously, none of this would have happened if it weren't for you.",2,How I Met Your Mother,137,26
8522,Lily,6," Oh. You know what, Ted? That was very nice. You have earned these screws back. Don't sit in your desk chair until you've put them back in.",2,How I Met Your Mother,139,27
8523,Ted,6," Hey, I'm project manager now, so, if you want your old job back...",2,How I Met Your Mother,67,13
8524,Lily,6," No, thanks. I think I figured out what I want to be when I grow up.",2,How I Met Your Mother,68,16
8526,Lily,6," Casey, that's not how we treat people. You'll get this back when you learn to be nice.",2,How I Met Your Mother,87,17
8528,Robin,6," Barney! Oh, my god!",2,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
8529,Ted,6, What happened?,2,How I Met Your Mother,15,2
8531,Barney,6," That's not true. It's just temporarily dislocated. Seriously, I'm fine.",2,How I Met Your Mother,72,10
8533,Marshall,6," Professor Lewis, hi.",2,How I Met Your Mother,21,3
8535,Barney,6," Yeah, she was.",2,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
8537,Barney,6," B-plus?! Marshall, after I've gone through my eight weeks of physical therapy, I am going to get you that ""A""!",2,How I Met Your Mother,111,20
8538,Marshall,6, Let her go. She belongs out there in the wild. You should feel proud. You fought the cougar and lived.,2,How I Met Your Mother,103,20
8541,Lily,7, It's just that all I've ever done is teach kindergarten. I want to get out there and change the world. I want to find my passion.,2,How I Met Your Mother,130,26
8543,Lily,7, I'm going to be a life coach.,2,How I Met Your Mother,30,7
8545,Lily,7, I'm going to be a marine biologist... Slam poet... Beekeeper! Not a beekeeper.,2,How I Met Your Mother,79,13
8546,Robin,7, Her newest lifelong dream? Singing in a punk rock band.,2,How I Met Your Mother,56,10
8547,Ted,7, What is she doing for money through all this?,2,How I Met Your Mother,46,9
8548,Robin,7," Oh, she's been waiting tables at Big Wave Luau.",2,How I Met Your Mother,48,9
8549,Ted,7," Wait, you mean that hawaiian place where they wear those embarrassing outfits?",2,How I Met Your Mother,79,12
8550,Robin,7, No.,2,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
8552,Marshall,7, Here she comes. Here she comes.,2,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
8553,Lily,7," Welcome to big Wave Luau. Can I tiki your drink order? Aw, crap.",2,How I Met Your Mother,65,13
8554,Robin,7, I'm sorry.,2,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
8555,Barney,7," Oh, hi, Lily. We were just in the neighborhood, thought we'd get some lunch. We didn't even know you'd be here. .",2,How I Met Your Mother,114,22
8556,Lily,7, What do you want?,2,How I Met Your Mother,18,4
8557,Ted,7, I don't think that's how you're supposed to greet a customer at Big Wave Luau.,2,How I Met Your Mother,79,15
8558,Lily,7," Aloha, island visitors. The big wave brought you to our humble luau. For that, we thank you. Or in my native tongue, mahalo.",2,How I Met Your Mother,125,23
8559,Barney,7, I didn't catch your name. Did you guys catch her name?,2,How I Met Your Mother,55,11
8560,Ted,7, No.,2,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
8561,Lily,7," My name is Anuhea. It means cool and fragrant,much like any of our 12 specialty drinks.",2,How I Met Your Mother,88,16
8562,Ted,7," Robin, nothing to add?",2,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
8563,Robin,7, No. Lily is my friend and I'm not going to make fun of her for trying to follow her dreams.,2,How I Met Your Mother,92,20
8564,Lily,7, Thank you.,2,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
8565,Robin,7," Although, you might want to bring out the big hawaiian drum because I'm pretty sure today's my birthday.",2,How I Met Your Mother,105,18
8568,Marshall,7, I've never need the beer more than I do right now.,2,How I Met Your Mother,51,11
8569,Ted,7," I thought you said your semester was gonna be a piece of cake. I remember because you were eating a piece of cake at the time and you said, ""dude, my semester is gonna be this.""",2,How I Met Your Mother,178,36
8570,Marshall,7," Yeah, well, it was supposed to be, but my professor's like the toughest grader I've ever seen. She had like a bad divorce this summer and now she's taking it out on us. To tell you the truth, I think she just needs to get laid.",2,How I Met Your Mother,228,46
8571,Barney,7," Really? Laid, you say?",2,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
8572,Marshall,7," You wouldn't be into her.She's, like, in her late 40s.",2,How I Met Your Mother,55,10
8573,Barney,7, She hot?,2,How I Met Your Mother,9,2
8574,Marshall,7," Yeah, I guess she's kind of hot, yeah.",2,How I Met Your Mother,39,8
8575,Barney,7, And she's looking for some action. Sounds to me like she could be a cougar.,2,How I Met Your Mother,76,15
8576,Robin,7, A what?,2,How I Met Your Mother,8,2
8577,Barney,7," A cougar. An older woman, usually in her 40s or 50s, single and on the prowl for a younger man.",2,How I Met Your Mother,96,20
8578,Ted,7, What's a woman in her 60s or 70s? A turtle?,2,How I Met Your Mother,44,10
8579,Barney,7," Marshall, I've thought it over and I accept your challenge.",2,How I Met Your Mother,60,10
8580,Marshall,7, I didn't challenge you to have s*x with...,2,How I Met Your Mother,43,8
8581,Barney,7," Tomorrow, the cougar hunt begins.",2,How I Met Your Mother,34,5
8582,Lily,7," So, I quit my job. I just couldn't take it anymore. Approximately 50 times a day, some guy asks me for a lei...",2,How I Met Your Mother,112,23
8583,Marshall,7, Classic.,2,How I Met Your Mother,9,1
8584,Robin,7," Ted, didn't you tell me they need a new assistant in your office?",2,How I Met Your Mother,66,13
8585,Ted,7, Yeah. Somebody did just quit.,2,How I Met Your Mother,30,5
8587,Ted,7," So, where should we eat today?  Oh awesome, you brought lunch for everyone? ",2,How I Met Your Mother,77,13
8589,Marshall,7," Dude, that is cold-blooded.",2,How I Met Your Mother,28,4
8590,Ted,7," It was an honest mistake. Look, when somebody opens up a container with an entire chicken in it, it's okay to assume they made lunch for everyone.",2,How I Met Your Mother,147,27
8591,Robin,7," Ted, that girl didn't quit. You destroyed her.",2,How I Met Your Mother,47,8
8592,Ted,7, It was an whole chicken. And did I mention she had 12 sides?,2,How I Met Your Mother,61,13
8593,Barney,7," Oh, now you're gonna bash her figure. Real classy, Ted.",2,How I Met Your Mother,56,10
8594,Ted,7," So, Lily, what do you say? Do you want the job?",2,How I Met Your Mother,48,11
8595,Lily,7, What would I be doing?,2,How I Met Your Mother,23,5
8596,Ted,7," Basically, you're sort of a general office assistant.",2,How I Met Your Mother,54,8
8598,Ted,7, You'll sit there. My station is right over here. And things are a little bit crazy right now 'cause we're pitching a new building to a big client.,2,How I Met Your Mother,147,28
8599,Lily,7," Oh, right, is that the...?",2,How I Met Your Mother,27,5
8600,Ted,7, Yeah. Here's the model.,2,How I Met Your Mother,24,4
8601,Lily,7, You weren't kidding. It really does look like a giant pen1s.,2,How I Met Your Mother,61,11
8602,Ted,7," I know. For whatever reason, Mr. Druthers just doesn't see it.",2,How I Met Your Mother,63,11
8603,Lily,7, How can he not see it? I mean there's the...,2,How I Met Your Mother,45,10
8604,Ted,7, I know.,2,How I Met Your Mother,8,2
8605,Lily,7, And the way it...,2,How I Met Your Mother,18,4
8606,Ted,7, I know.,2,How I Met Your Mother,8,2
8607,Lily,7, And the two little...,2,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
8608,Ted,7, I know.,2,How I Met Your Mother,8,2
8609,Lily,7, It is just...,2,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
8611,Ted,7," Lily, this is Mr. Druthers, the head architect on the project. Lily's going to be our new office assistant.",2,How I Met Your Mother,108,19
8613,Lily,7, Nice to meet you.,2,How I Met Your Mother,18,4
8615,Ted,7," I, uh... I am an architect.",2,How I Met Your Mother,28,6
8617,Ted,7," Well, not unless he somehow passed all his licensing exams.",2,How I Met Your Mother,60,10
8619,Ted,7, Absolutely.,2,How I Met Your Mother,12,1
8621,Ted,7, Styrofoam trees.,2,How I Met Your Mother,17,2
8623,Ted,7, Styrofoam trees.,2,How I Met Your Mother,17,2
8625,Ted,7, Styrofoam trees!,2,How I Met Your Mother,17,2
8627,Lily,7," Man, that guy is a total, well... ",2,How I Met Your Mother,35,7
8629,Marshall,7," Okay, wait, wait, wait. That's professor Lewis's office there.",2,How I Met Your Mother,63,9
8630,Barney,7," Okay, let's take a look. Oh, yeah, it's a cougar all right. A prime specimen. See, you can identify a cougar by a few key characteristics. Start with the hair. The cougar keeps up with current hairstyles as a form of camouflage. The prey may not realize that he's engaged a cougar until he's already being dragged, helpless, back to her lair. Now, the blouse. The cougar displays maximum cleavage possible to captivate her prey. If you're watching them bounce, she's about to pounce. See the claws? Long and sharp, to ward off rival females... Or open alimony checks. Yeah, this one's a beaut. Okay, let the hunt begin.",2,How I Met Your Mother,620,109
8631,Marshall,7," Wait, wait, wait.I'm not so sure I'm comfortable with you hunting my constitutional law professor.",2,How I Met Your Mother,99,15
8632,Barney,7, Who do you rather have grading your papers,2,How I Met Your Mother,43,8
8633,Marshall,7," Go, Barney. Go mount and stuff that cougar.",2,How I Met Your Mother,44,8
8634,Barney,7," Scusi, I am Luigi, italian exchange student. I was, uh, walking to class, but then I noticed you... Bella principessa...",2,How I Met Your Mother,121,20
8636,Barney,7, Direct. I like that. The name's Barney. What I want... is you.,2,How I Met Your Mother,63,12
8639,Lily,7, I can't believe how Mr. Druthers treats people. And that building? Talk about overcompensating.,2,How I Met Your Mother,96,14
8640,Ted,7," He's not usually this bad. It's just that the partners have made it very clear this project is make or break for us, so lately he's been a little testy.  You know what I mean",2,How I Met Your Mother,175,35
8641,Robin,7, Did you show lily your design?,2,How I Met Your Mother,31,6
8642,Ted,7, No.,2,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
8643,Lily,7, What design?,2,How I Met Your Mother,13,2
8644,Ted,7, It's nothing.,2,How I Met Your Mother,14,2
8645,Robin,7," It's fantastic. Just for fun, Ted's been working on his own design. And it doesn't look at all like male genitalia. At least, not healthy male genitalia.",2,How I Met Your Mother,154,27
8646,Lily,7," Ted, you should pitch your building to Druthers.",2,How I Met Your Mother,49,8
8647,Ted,7," Are you kidding? He's Hammond Druthers. He's a legend. I'm just part of his team. This building is huge for the firm, so it's really important we don't blow it.  All right, enough!",2,How I Met Your Mother,181,33
8649,Barney,7," Oh, my god. Incredible.",2,How I Met Your Mother,24,4
8651,Barney,7, C minus? What are you talking about? I just pulled an all-nighter!,2,How I Met Your Mother,67,12
8654,Lily,7, Mr. Druthers asked if you were making the trees or waiting for them to sprout on their own. Then he stared at me until I laughed.,2,How I Met Your Mother,130,26
8655,Ted,7," Okay, I'm done.",2,How I Met Your Mother,16,3
8656,Lily,7, Great. I'll put the paints away. You just go show him.,2,How I Met Your Mother,55,11
8657,Ted,7, Great. Thanks.,2,How I Met Your Mother,15,2
8659,Ted,7," Good one, sir. Anyway, here they are.",2,How I Met Your Mother,38,7
8661,Ted,7, Too green?,2,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
8663,Ted,7, I can't un-picture it.,2,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
8665,Ted,7, What? What's gone?,2,How I Met Your Mother,19,3
8667,Ted,7," Well, it's got to be around here somewhere.",2,How I Met Your Mother,44,8
8669,Ted,7," Well, um, I better get back to these styrofoam trees.",2,How I Met Your Mother,54,10
8671,Ted,7," Inspiring as always, sir. Lily? Where's she put those paints? ",2,How I Met Your Mother,63,10
8674,Lily,7, Hey.,2,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
8675,Ted,7," Hey. Um, Lily, question for you. Why did I find Mr. Druthers' baseball signed three times by Pete Rose in your desk drawer?",2,How I Met Your Mother,124,23
8676,Lily,7, That's easy. I took it.,2,How I Met Your Mother,24,5
8677,Ted,7, Why?,2,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
8678,Lily,7, It's simple.,2,How I Met Your Mother,13,2
8683,Lily,7," Okay, I may have exaggerated that last one, but the point is, he was mean. And that's why I took away his ball.",2,How I Met Your Mother,112,23
8684,Ted,7, What does his ball have to do with anything?,2,How I Met Your Mother,45,9
8685,Lily,7," Druthers has to be taught he can't behave like that. When I was teaching kindergarten,whenever a kid was mean, I would take away one of his toys. The kid would be upset at first,but then he'd learn to stop being mean.",2,How I Met Your Mother,218,41
8686,Robin,7," Hey, guys. What's going on?",2,How I Met Your Mother,28,5
8687,Ted,7, Lily stole my boss' baseball signed three times by Pete Rose.,2,How I Met Your Mother,62,11
8688,Robin,7, Why? Was he being mean?,2,How I Met Your Mother,24,5
8689,Ted,7, You know about this?,2,How I Met Your Mother,21,4
8690,Robin,7, Yeah. It's her own personal form of justice. Did you tell him about that time at the Gap?,2,How I Met Your Mother,90,18
8691,Lily,7," Oh, that was a good one. This sales guy was rude to Robin, so I took a pair of khakis.",2,How I Met Your Mother,87,20
8692,Robin,7, I gave them to you for your birthday.,2,How I Met Your Mother,38,8
8693,Ted,7, So I've been walking around in stolen khakis?,2,How I Met Your Mother,46,8
8694,Lily,7," I prefer to call them ""justice khakis.""",2,How I Met Your Mother,40,7
8695,Ted,7," That's not justice. It's shoplifting,and it's a crime.",2,How I Met Your Mother,55,8
8696,Lily,7, So is being mean.,2,How I Met Your Mother,18,4
8697,Ted,7," Lily, your little system doesn't even make sense. In kindergarten, the kid knew why he was being punished. Druthers just thinks someone stole his ball.",2,How I Met Your Mother,152,25
8698,Lily,7," Well, that's why I left a note.",2,How I Met Your Mother,32,7
8699,Ted,7, A note?,2,How I Met Your Mother,8,2
8700,Lily,7," Yeah. When he finds it, he'll understand why his ball was taken away, he'll stop being mean, and the office will be a nicer place to work. Maybe he'll even be open to hearing your ideas.",2,How I Met Your Mother,187,36
8701,Ted,7," Look, Lil, we're all tolerating this prolonged nervous breakdown you're clearly having, with the punk band and the beekeeping and the petty larceny, but this is my career you're messing with.",2,How I Met Your Mother,192,31
8702,Lily,7, I'm not sure I like your tone. You know what? Now you just lost the ball.,2,How I Met Your Mother,74,16
8704,Marshall,7," I'd ask you how last night went, but we had a pop quiz today. Nobody got higher than a c-minus.",2,How I Met Your Mother,96,20
8705,Barney,7," I know, I know.",2,How I Met Your Mother,16,4
8706,Marshall,7, You claim to have so much s*x. I only assumed you'd be good at it.,2,How I Met Your Mother,67,15
8707,Barney,7," Look, I miscalculated. I thought she'd be old and fragile, like most cougars. But kitty's got claws. Don't worry though. Tonight, I'm seeing her again.",2,How I Met Your Mother,152,25
8708,Marshall,7," Just let it go, man. You're making things worse.",2,How I Met Your Mother,49,9
8709,Barney,7," I promise you, after tonight, that cougar will be my pet, and I its master.",2,How I Met Your Mother,76,15
8711,Barney,7, I think I'm falling in love with you.,2,How I Met Your Mother,38,8
8713,Barney,7, What? No.We had s*x yesterday.,2,How I Met Your Mother,31,5
8716,Ted,7," When Druthers goes to get his bagel, I'll go in, grab the note, put the ball back. If something goes wrong, yell out, ""who wants espresso?"" So I'll know he's coming. Got it? Okay, now give me the ball.",2,How I Met Your Mother,202,39
8717,Lily,7, No.,2,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
8718,Ted,7," What do you mean, no?",2,How I Met Your Mother,22,5
8719,Lily,7," I mean I stand by what I did, Ted.",2,How I Met Your Mother,35,9
8720,Ted,7," Come on, Lily. We're running out of time.",2,How I Met Your Mother,42,8
8722,Lily,7," ""Who wants espresso?""",2,How I Met Your Mother,22,3
8725,Lily,7, Interesting.,2,How I Met Your Mother,13,1
8727,Lily,7," Wow. Looks like bye-bye, iPod.",2,How I Met Your Mother,31,5
8728,Ted,7, Give him his ball back right now. People are going to get fired.,2,How I Met Your Mother,65,13
8729,Lily,7," No, they're not. It's just a tantrum, Ted. I saw this in kindergarten all the time.",2,How I Met Your Mother,84,16
8730,Ted,7," This isn't kindergarten. Mr Druthers is an adult, and he wants his ball back.",2,How I Met Your Mother,78,14
8731,Lily,7," All right, I'll give it back if you show him your plans.",2,How I Met Your Mother,57,12
8732,Ted,7, No. You'll give it back or you're fired.,2,How I Met Your Mother,41,8
8733,Lily,7," I'm sorry, Ted. I just can't do that.",2,How I Met Your Mother,38,8
8734,Ted,7, Then you're fired.,2,How I Met Your Mother,19,3
8735,Lily,7, Fine. Here's the ball. At least you have one now.,2,How I Met Your Mother,50,10
8737,Marshall,7," Dude, you're killing me. You didn't tame the cougar. You just made her angrier.",2,How I Met Your Mother,80,14
8738,Barney,7, Do you not see the powerbar in my hand? I'm fueling up.,2,How I Met Your Mother,56,12
8739,Marshall,7, So you're going back over there?,2,How I Met Your Mother,33,6
8740,Barney,7," Oh, yeah. And tonight, just like John Mellencamp, I am going to get rid of the ""cougar"" once and for all. Get it? 'Cause that's what he did with his name.",2,How I Met Your Mother,155,31
8742,Barney,7, I can't stop thinking about you. Please give me another chance.,2,How I Met Your Mother,64,11
8744,Barney,7," But you don't understand. See, I've been going easy on you, holding back, 'cause I was afraid you'd break a hip or something. But, this time, no mercy.I don't care how long it takes days, weeks, half a year.",2,How I Met Your Mother,208,39
8748,Ted,7," Mr. Druthers, thank you again for understanding about Lily.",2,How I Met Your Mother,60,9
8750,Ted,7, Lily was mentally deranged.,2,How I Met Your Mother,28,4
8752,Ted,7, Lily was mentally deranged!,2,How I Met Your Mother,28,4
8764,Ted,7, Wait! We have one more idea for you.,2,How I Met Your Mother,37,8
8766,Ted,7, I have another design.,2,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
8768,Ted,7, No.,2,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
8770,Robin,7, To Ted! The youngest person to ever design a building over 70 stories... Probably!,2,How I Met Your Mother,83,14
8772,Lily,7," Congrats, ted.",2,How I Met Your Mother,15,2
8773,Ted,7," Hey, thanks for telling me to stand up to Druthers and pitch my idea. Seriously, none of this would have happened if it weren't for you.",2,How I Met Your Mother,137,26
8774,Lily,7," Oh. You know what, Ted? That was very nice. You have earned these screws back. Don't sit in your desk chair until you've put them back in.",2,How I Met Your Mother,139,27
8775,Ted,7," Hey, I'm project manager now, so, if you want your old job back...",2,How I Met Your Mother,67,13
8776,Lily,7," No, thanks. I think I figured out what I want to be when I grow up.",2,How I Met Your Mother,68,16
8778,Lily,7," Casey, that's not how we treat people. You'll get this back when you learn to be nice.",2,How I Met Your Mother,87,17
8780,Robin,7," Barney! Oh, my god!",2,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
8781,Ted,7, What happened?,2,How I Met Your Mother,15,2
8783,Barney,7," That's not true. It's just temporarily dislocated. Seriously, I'm fine.",2,How I Met Your Mother,72,10
8785,Marshall,7," Professor Lewis, hi.",2,How I Met Your Mother,21,3
8787,Barney,7," Yeah, she was.",2,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
8789,Barney,7," B-plus?! Marshall, after I've gone through my eight weeks of physical therapy, I am going to get you that ""A""!",2,How I Met Your Mother,111,20
8790,Marshall,7, Let her go. She belongs out there in the wild. You should feel proud. You fought the cougar and lived.,2,How I Met Your Mother,103,20
8793,Lily,8," Oh, my God. These pancakes are delicious!",2,How I Met Your Mother,42,7
8794,Marshall,8," Yes! Thank you. Uhm, I learned how to cook while you were gone this summer.",2,How I Met Your Mother,76,15
8795,Lily,8, Oh. Do you want to cook dinner tonight?,2,How I Met Your Mother,40,8
8796,Marshall,8," Yeah, sure. How about pancakes?",2,How I Met Your Mother,32,5
8798,Lily,8," You may not have much range, but at least I'm marrying a guy who knows how to make pancakes.",2,How I Met Your Mother,93,19
8799,Marshall,8," Oh, uhm...",2,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
8800,Lily,8," I mean, uhm... Well, I... I realize that we haven't really discussed whether us getting back together means us getting married, but... I still wanna. Do you still wanna?",2,How I Met Your Mother,170,29
8801,Marshall,8, Really?,2,How I Met Your Mother,8,1
8802,Lily,8," Of course, I love you.",2,How I Met Your Mother,23,5
8803,Marshall,8," No, I mean, that's how you're gonna do it? ""Do you still wanna?"" That's like the lamest proposal ever. When I did it, I got down on my knees... I don't know, I'm just saying.",2,How I Met Your Mother,175,35
8804,Lily,8," Marshall Eriksen, will you ma...",2,How I Met Your Mother,33,5
8805,Marshall,8," No, no, no, no, no, no.",2,How I Met Your Mother,24,6
8806,Lily,8, What?!,2,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
8807,Marshall,8," You can't lead with that. You got to... build up to that. You got to have, like, a little speech.",2,How I Met Your Mother,98,20

9023,Robin,8," Okay, Lil, why is it so important to do this today?",2,How I Met Your Mother,52,11
9024,Lily,8," Because...

9025,Robin,8, Nobody's gonna do that.,2,How I Met Your Mother,24,4

9039,Barney,8," Well, those are my old gambling buddies. Truth is... I used to come here all the time. Play an old Chinese game called ""Shing Hasabu Shing"". Had a small gambling problem.

9048,Ted,8," No, you don't.",2,How I Met Your Mother,15,3

9071,Robin,8, After I spent all this money on a bridesmaid shirt?,2,How I Met Your Mother,52,10
9072,Barney,8," Did I bet someone that they'd call it off? I did, didn't I? Who'd I bet?",2,How I Met Your Mother,73,16
9073,Ted,8, You actually expect any of us are gonna come to your third wedding?,2,How I Met Your Mother,68,13
9074,Lily,8," Yes. Because it's gonna be amazing. Look, before I was afraid to face Marshall's family and I didn't want to do all that work, but... Now that we're here... I realize that I have to face Marshall's family and I really want to do all that work.",2,How I Met Your Mother,244,47
9075,Marshall,8," So do I. And yeah... My family might still be upset with you. But when they see us up there, they're gonna see how much we love each other and none of that other stuff is gonna matter.",2,How I Met Your Mother,185,38
9076,Lily,8," I love you, Marshmallow.",2,How I Met Your Mother,25,4
9077,Marshall,8," I love you, too, Lilypad.",2,How I Met Your Mother,26,5
9079,Lily,8, What?!,2,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
9081,Marshall,8, Are... we married? Did you just marry us? Weren't you listening? We don't want to be married.,2,How I Met Your Mother,94,17
9085,Lily,8," Oh, whew... That was close.",2,How I Met Your Mother,28,5

9089,Marshall,8, Hey... Ted.,2,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
9090,Lily,8, Is Robin here?,2,How I Met Your Mother,15,3

9101,Ted,9," Oh, I got your total...counting along...",2,How I Met Your Mother,41,6
9105,Ted,9, You're scared of the Seven Dwarfs?,2,How I Met Your Mother,35,6
9106,Robin,9," Just Doc. He's creepy. I mean, the guy went to medical school. What's he doing living with six coal miners?",2,How I Met Your Mother,108,20
9108,Barney,9," Oh, man, I'm so excited. I couldn't sleep last night. I bet you guys couldn't either.",2,How I Met Your Mother,86,16
9109,Robin,9, Why?,2,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
9110,Barney,9," Ah, only the gala event for the grand opening of Sharper Image's 500th store. Didn't you get my email?",2,How I Met Your Mother,103,19
9111,Robin,9," No, I blocked your address after the fourth time you sent me the video of the monkey sniffing his own butt.",2,How I Met Your Mother,108,21
9112,Barney,9," Come on, it's on me! I'm buying three of you foot massagers and one of you a nose hair trimmer. You know who you are.",2,How I Met Your Mother,118,25
9114,Barney,9," Come on, let's go.",2,How I Met Your Mother,19,4
9115,Robin,9," All right, I'm in.",2,How I Met Your Mother,19,4
9117,Barney,9, To the Willowbrook Mall!,2,How I Met Your Mother,25,4
9119,Robin,9," Oh, it's at a mall? I'm not going.",2,How I Met Your Mother,35,8
9120,Ted,9, What? Why not?,2,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
9121,Robin,9, I just don't feel like going to a mall.,2,How I Met Your Mother,40,9
9122,Lily,9, We can split a cinnabun.,2,How I Met Your Mother,25,5
9123,Robin,9," No, I'm really not gonna go.",2,How I Met Your Mother,29,6
9124,Ted,9," Come on, it'll be fun.",2,How I Met Your Mother,23,5
9125,Robin,9," No, I don't go to malls! Sorry, I just don't like malls.",2,How I Met Your Mother,57,12
9126,Barney,9, Why not?,2,How I Met Your Mother,9,2
9127,Robin,9, I'd rather not say.,2,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
9129,Ted,9," Guys, guys, guys, Robin doesn't like malls. If she doesn't want to tell us why, she doesn't have to. I think we should all just respect her privacy.",2,How I Met Your Mother,149,28
9130,Robin,9, Thanks Ted.,2,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
9133,Ted,9," So, what's the deal with you and malls?",2,How I Met Your Mother,40,8
9134,Robin,9," You said if I didn't want to talk about it, I didn't have to.",2,How I Met Your Mother,62,14
9135,Ted,9," Yeah, with those people. I'm your boyfriend. Come on, what is it? Did you get arrested in a mall?",2,How I Met Your Mother,98,19
9136,Robin,9, No.,2,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
9137,Ted,9, Dumped in a mall?,2,How I Met Your Mother,18,4
9138,Robin,9, Ted.,2,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
9139,Ted,9, Found out you were Canadian at a mall?,2,How I Met Your Mother,39,8
9140,Robin,9, Let it go.,2,How I Met Your Mother,11,3
9141,Ted,9, Trapped under a fake boulder at the mall? Robin,2,How I Met Your Mother,48,9
9142,Ted,9, Mauled at the mall?,2,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
9143,Robin,9, Let it go. And who gets trapped under a fake boulder at the mall? Ted,2,How I Met Your Mother,70,15
9147,Ted,9," What, I don't get it, why won't Robin tell me why she hates malls?",2,How I Met Your Mother,67,14
9148,Barney,9," Ted, you should be happy Robin has a secret. The more you learn about a person, the better chance you have of hitting the fatal 'oh' moment.",2,How I Met Your Mother,141,27
9149,Marshall,9, The 'oh' moment?,2,How I Met Your Mother,17,3
9150,Barney,9," Yeah, that moment when you find out that one detail about a person that is going to be a deal breaker.",2,How I Met Your Mother,103,21
9153,Barney,9, Oh.,2,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
9157,Barney,9, Oh.,2,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
9161,Barney,9, Oh.,2,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
9164,Barney,9," So, trust me, you want to postpone knowing anything about each other for as long as possible.",2,How I Met Your Mother,94,17
9165,Ted,9," I disagree. If there's some potential 'oh' moment, I want to know about it right away. I mean, what's the alternative?",2,How I Met Your Mother,119,21
9169,Ted,9, I love you.,2,How I Met Your Mother,12,3
9170,Robin,9, I used to be a dude.,2,How I Met Your Mother,21,6
9172,Lily,9," Yeah, I agree with Ted. In a real relationship, you share everything. That's why Marshall and I don't keep any secrets.",2,How I Met Your Mother,120,21
9173,Barney,9," You are such a cutie pie. Here's a quarter, go play something on the jukebox.",2,How I Met Your Mother,78,15
9174,Ted,9, It's true. They tell each other everything.,2,How I Met Your Mother,44,7
9175,Barney,9, I can think of tons of things there's no way Marshall told you,2,How I Met Your Mother,63,13
9176,Lily,9, Try me.,2,How I Met Your Mother,8,2
9177,Barney,9, Do you know about the time the Marshall was in Trenton?,2,How I Met Your Mother,56,11
9178,Lily,9, Doggie ate his pants. Yep.,2,How I Met Your Mother,27,5
9179,Barney,9, Bill's bachelor party in Memphis.,2,How I Met Your Mother,34,5
9180,Lily,9," Oh, when they had to pump out all the nickels from his stomach?",2,How I Met Your Mother,64,13
9181,Barney,9," OK, Seattle.",2,How I Met Your Mother,13,2
9182,Lily,9," Trick question, Marshall's never been to the Pacific Northwest because he's afraid of Sasquatch.",2,How I Met Your Mother,97,14
9183,Barney,9, Damn.,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
9184,Marshall,9, I'm not afraid of Sasquatch. I just think we should all be on alert.,2,How I Met Your Mother,69,14
9185,Ted,9," Trust me, not only do they tell each other everything. They want to know everything.",2,How I Met Your Mother,85,15
9187,Marshall,9," So, after the shower, I was brushing my teeth, and I was like, oh man, I wanted to have some orange juice, I should have done that first, but I already had the toothpaste on the toothbrush so I just went ahead and brushed them anyway.",2,How I Met Your Mother,235,46
9188,Lily,9, What happened next?,2,How I Met Your Mother,20,3
9191,Barney,9," Fine, do you want to know what Robin's secret is?",2,How I Met Your Mother,50,10
9192,Ted,9, You know?,2,How I Met Your Mother,10,2
9193,Barney,9," Of course I know. She couldn't look at us. Her face got flushed. That's shame. Our friend, Robin, used to do p0rn, wait for it, ography.",2,How I Met Your Mother,137,26
9194,Ted,9," Yeah, we didn't really have to wait for that. And it's ridiculous.",2,How I Met Your Mother,67,12
9195,Lily,9," I don't know, he could be right. She does have the fake orgasm noises down.",2,How I Met Your Mother,76,15
9196,Ted,9, Hey.,2,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
9197,Lily,9, What? The walls are thin.,2,How I Met Your Mother,26,5
9198,Ted,9, That's not what I'm hey-ing you about.,2,How I Met Your Mother,39,7
9199,Marshall,9, You know what it might be. This is gonna sound a little crazy but what if robin's married?,2,How I Met Your Mother,91,18
9200,Ted,9, Married? What does have to do with the mall?,2,How I Met Your Mother,45,9
9201,Marshall,9," Well, maybe she got married at the mall. Back home in Minnesota a ton of people would get married at the Mall of America, it's great. It's a gorgeous indoor golf course for pictures. Numerous fine dining options, and talk about a reasonable price...",2,How I Met Your Mother,250,44
9202,Lily,9, We're not getting married at the mall.,2,How I Met Your Mother,39,7
9203,Marshall,9, Just meet with the guy.,2,How I Met Your Mother,24,5
9204,Ted,9, She's not married. Robin hates marriage.,2,How I Met Your Mother,41,6
9205,Marshall,9," Because she already got married, at the mall.",2,How I Met Your Mother,46,8
9206,Lily,9," No, because before Robin moved to New York, she...What was she doing?",2,How I Met Your Mother,70,12
9207,Ted,9," Well, I don't know, whenever I ask her about Canada, she kinda clams up.",2,How I Met Your Mother,73,14
9208,Marshall,9, She's a pretty private person.,2,How I Met Your Mother,31,5
9209,Lily,9, Except when she's talking about...,2,How I Met Your Mother,35,5
9211,Robin,9, A friend of mine in Canada got married way too young and it really turned her off to marriage.,2,How I Met Your Mother,95,19
9213,Lily,9, What do you think of this wedding cake?,2,How I Met Your Mother,40,8
9214,Robin,9," Oh, I like it. Hey, you remember that friend of mine in Canada who got married too young? Her wedding cake was a Mrs. Field's giant cookie.",2,How I Met Your Mother,140,27
9216,Lily,9, No.,2,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
9219,Robin,9," My friend in Canada who got married way too young, they had to do their vows twice, once in French.",2,How I Met Your Mother,100,20
9220,Barney,9, They speak French there too? God! That place is a mess.,2,How I Met Your Mother,56,11
9222,Ted,9," So, you don't think there's any friend from Canada?",2,How I Met Your Mother,52,9
9223,Marshall,9," Oh, I'm sure there is. Just like I have a friend who wet his bed till he was ten. Use your brain, Ted.",2,How I Met Your Mother,103,23
9224,Barney,9," Guys, there's not way Robin's married. It's ludicrous to even suggest it.",2,How I Met Your Mother,74,12
9225,Ted,9, Thank you Barney.,2,How I Met Your Mother,18,3
9226,Barney,9, 'Cause it's p0rn.,2,How I Met Your Mother,18,3
9227,Ted,9, I need another beer.,2,How I Met Your Mother,21,4
9229,Marshall,9, Robin is not in p0rn. I'll bet you anything that she's married.,2,How I Met Your Mother,64,12
9230,Barney,9," 20,000 says it's p0rn.",2,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
9231,Marshall,9," I don't have 20,000.",2,How I Met Your Mother,21,4
9232,Barney,9," Well then, what do you have?",2,How I Met Your Mother,29,6
9233,Marshall,9, Well.,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
9235,Lily,9, No.,2,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
9236,Barney,9, I got it. The ultimate wager. Slap bet.,2,How I Met Your Mother,40,8
9237,Ted,9," Oh, slap bet. We used to do those when I was a kid.",2,How I Met Your Mother,52,13
9238,Lily,9, What the hell's a slap bet?,2,How I Met Your Mother,28,6
9239,Marshall,9," Whoever's right gets to slap the other person in the face as hard as they possibly can, but no rings.",2,How I Met Your Mother,102,20
9240,Lily,9, Are you really gonna do that? That's so immature. Marshall,2,How I Met Your Mother,59,10
9241,Lily,9," Oh, I love it. What are my powers?",2,How I Met Your Mother,35,8
9242,Marshall,9," Um, if a problem arises and we need a ruling, that's your job. Barney",2,How I Met Your Mother,70,14
9243,Marshall,9," And your tombstone will read, ""got slapped by Marshall so hard, he died.""",2,How I Met Your Mother,74,13
9245,Ted,9," All right, what if I ask Robin point-blank if she has a husband?",2,How I Met Your Mother,65,13
9246,Lily,9, You said you would respect her privacy so maybe you should just drop it.,2,How I Met Your Mother,73,14
9247,Ted,9," Yeah, you're right.",2,How I Met Your Mother,20,3
9250,Ted,9, Husband.,2,How I Met Your Mother,9,1
9251,Robin,9, There's no 'p' in husband.,2,How I Met Your Mother,27,5
9252,Ted,9," Wow, you seem to know a lot about husbands.",2,How I Met Your Mother,44,9
9254,Ted,9," Fine, I'll take it back.",2,How I Met Your Mother,25,5
9256,Ted,9," Oh, hey, since you mentioned husbands, this is great, you're gonna love this. Marshall, you know Marshall. He thinks that the reason you didn't wanna go to the mall the other day is because you got married in a mall and have a husband in Canada.",2,How I Met Your Mother,246,46
9257,Robin,9, Huh.,2,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
9258,Ted,9," I told him he's crazy because he's crazy, right? I mean, how crazy is that?",2,How I Met Your Mother,76,15
9259,Robin,9, Are you asking me if I'm married? Ted,2,How I Met Your Mother,38,8
9260,Robin,9, What happened to respecting my privacy? Ted,2,How I Met Your Mother,44,7
9261,Robin,9," Ted, I don't understand why you can't...",2,How I Met Your Mother,41,7
9262,Ted,9," Just say, ""no, I'm not married.""",2,How I Met Your Mother,33,6
9263,Robin,9," I can't. Marshall's right. I was young and I got married. It was a mistake and he moved away, but, yeah, I'm married.",2,How I Met Your Mother,118,23
9264,Ted,9, Oh.,2,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
9266,Ted,9, You have a husband? Robin,2,How I Met Your Mother,26,5
9267,Ted,9, Why didn't you get divorced?,2,How I Met Your Mother,29,5
9268,Robin,9," He moved to Hong Kong for work and I was like, good enough.",2,How I Met Your Mother,60,13
9269,Ted,9," Good... good enough. That's not good enough. You order pancakes and you get waffles, that's good enough.",2,How I Met Your Mother,105,17
9270,Robin,9, I haven't seen him in years. It's just a part of my life I wanna forget. Just please don't tell anyone about this.,2,How I Met Your Mother,115,23
9271,Ted,9, OK.,2,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
9275,Barney,9, Your hand is monstrous.,2,How I Met Your Mother,24,4
9276,Marshall,9," Well, what did you expect? You've seen my pen1s.",2,How I Met Your Mother,49,9
9278,Lily,9, I can't believe you told us Robin's secret.,2,How I Met Your Mother,44,8
9279,Ted,9, How can I keep something like that to myself? And you begged me to tell you.,2,How I Met Your Mother,77,16
9280,Lily,9, No I didn't.,2,How I Met Your Mother,13,3
9282,Lily,9," Please tell us, just tell us. I'm begging you. Tell us, tell us, tell us, please, please, please, please, please.",2,How I Met Your Mother,114,20
9283,Ted,9," Fine, Robin's married.",2,How I Met Your Mother,23,3
9284,Marshall,9, Ha ha ha.,2,How I Met Your Mother,10,3
9287,Lily,9," Yeah, well, you still shouldn't have told us. I mean, what kind of boyfriend are you?",2,How I Met Your Mother,86,16
9288,Ted,9," See, that's just it. I'm not the boyfriend, I'm the mistress. No, not the mistress. The mastress. Master. What do you call it?",2,How I Met Your Mother,127,23
9289,Barney,9, I'm pretty sure we're gonna call is mistress.,2,How I Met Your Mother,46,8
9290,Ted,9, What am I gonna do? My girlfriend's married. Do I ask her to get a divorce?,2,How I Met Your Mother,76,16
9291,Lily,9," Ted, even if she is married, it's a Canadian marriage. It's like their money or their army. Nobody takes it seriously.",2,How I Met Your Mother,119,21
9292,Ted,9, It's serious to me.,2,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
9293,Marshall,9," You know what, in some countries, if you've been separated for longer than five years, technicall, you're no longer married. I can check it out at the law library at school.",2,How I Met Your Mother,174,31
9295,Marshall,9, I can see my hand print on your face.,2,How I Met Your Mother,38,9
9296,Barney,9," Don't get too cocky, Slappy. I just got a shipment of p0rn from Canada I have to go through.",2,How I Met Your Mother,93,19
9297,Marshall,9, I won the bet. Why are you still searching?,2,How I Met Your Mother,44,9
9298,Barney,9, Just because you were right doesn't mean I'm wrong.,2,How I Met Your Mother,52,9
9299,Lily,9," Oh, right, like you need an excuse to watch p0rn.",2,How I Met Your Mother,50,10
9300,Barney,9," Canadian p0rn. Trust me when I tell you their universal health care system doesn't cover breast implants. If I have to sit through one more flat-chested Nova Scotian riding a Mountie on the back of a Zamboni, I'll go ""oat"" of my mind.",2,How I Met Your Mother,235,43
9303,Ted,9, Hey.,2,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
9304,Marshall,9," Hey. Listen, dude, I gotta talk to you, but you gotta promise me that you won't tell Barney.",2,How I Met Your Mother,93,18
9305,Ted,9," Fine, I won't tell Barney. What is it?",2,How I Met Your Mother,39,8
9306,Marshall,9, Robin's not married.,2,How I Met Your Mother,21,3
9307,Ted,9," What? Then, why would she tell me she was?",2,How I Met Your Mother,43,9
9308,Marshall,9, I don't know but I cross-checked every record in Canada. There's no record of her ever being married.,2,How I Met Your Mother,102,18
9309,Ted,9, There must be some mistake.,2,How I Met Your Mother,28,5
9310,Marshall,9," I promise you, she's not married. She's not great at parking legally either.",2,How I Met Your Mother,77,13
9311,Ted,9," So, she lied to me? What, what am I gonna do? I can't confront her 'cause then she'll know I told you.",2,How I Met Your Mother,103,22
9312,Marshall,9," You gotta lawyer her. You gotta ask her a bunch of questions, try to trip her up, maybe make her feel guilty, whatever it takes to get a confession out of her.",2,How I Met Your Mother,160,32
9314,Ted,9," Thanks for telling me your secret. It means so much to me that you could be so, what's the word I'm looking for, honest.",2,How I Met Your Mother,121,24
9315,Robin,9, Thanks Ted.,2,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
9316,Ted,9," Yeah, you know what's probably the best part about your honesty? How truthful it is.",2,How I Met Your Mother,85,15
9317,Robin,9, I say we just move on.,2,How I Met Your Mother,23,6
9318,Ted,9," In order for me to get total closure on this whole my-girlfriend-has-a-husband thing, I think I'm gonna need a little bit more information. Like, what month did you get married? Robin",2,How I Met Your Mother,184,31
9319,Ted,9," Ah, Canada in June. That's great.",2,How I Met Your Mother,34,6
9320,Ted,9, Sit down or buffet.,2,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
9321,Robin,9, Um...,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
9322,Ted,9, Whoa. It's weird that you don't remember.,2,How I Met Your Mother,42,7
9323,Robin,9," No, I just didn't know how to answer because we did butlered hors deouvres in the atrium, but the actual dinner was a buffet in the food court featuring a filet mignon or roasted potato-crusted salmon with a lobster scallion ber blanc.",2,How I Met Your Mother,236,42
9324,Ted,9, Hm. Band of DJ?,2,How I Met Your Mother,16,4
9325,Robin,9," String quartet played at the ceremony, but for the actual reception we had a seven-piece band. We paid extra for the sax 'cause I just love that smooth alto sound.",2,How I Met Your Mother,164,30
9326,Ted,9, How many bridesmaids? Robin,2,How I Met Your Mother,28,4
9327,Ted,9, Flowers? Robin,2,How I Met Your Mother,15,2

9333,Robin,9, Yes I was.,2,How I Met Your Mother,11,3
9334,Ted,9, No you weren't.,2,How I Met Your Mother,16,3
9335,Robin,9, How do you know?,2,How I Met Your Mother,17,4
9336,Ted,9, I looked it up at the library.,2,How I Met Your Mother,31,7
9337,Robin,9, What library?,2,How I Met Your Mother,14,2
9338,Ted,9, The one on 5th.,2,How I Met Your Mother,16,4
9339,Robin,9, When did you go?,2,How I Met Your Mother,17,4
9340,Ted,9, Today at lunch. And I had a an apple brie panini with potato salad....,2,How I Met Your Mother,71,14
9341,Robin,9," I'm not questioning the lunch part, Ted. What database did you use?",2,How I Met Your Mother,68,12
9342,Ted,9, I used the Canadian Mall Marriage 6000.,2,How I Met Your Mother,40,7
9344,Robin,9, You told Marshall?,2,How I Met Your Mother,19,3
9345,Ted,9, You lied to me!,2,How I Met Your Mother,16,4
9346,Robin,9," See, this is why I don't tell people secrets. You were supposed to be the one person I trusted the most and even you couldn't keep a secret.",2,How I Met Your Mother,141,28
9347,Ted,9, But it was a fake secret.,2,How I Met Your Mother,26,6
9348,Robin,9," Yeah, I was testing you and you failed, and now you're never gonna know why I never go to the mall. And it's good too.",2,How I Met Your Mother,119,25
9349,Ted,9," Testing me, that's insane.",2,How I Met Your Mother,27,4
9350,Robin,9," Oh yeah, how long did it take for you to tell Marshall my biggest secret in the world?",2,How I Met Your Mother,87,18
9351,Ted,9, That wasn't a real secret.,2,How I Met Your Mother,27,5
9352,Robin,9," Yeah, but it could have been.",2,How I Met Your Mother,30,6
9353,Ted,9, You are driving me crazy. No wonder your fake husband moved to Hong Kong.,2,How I Met Your Mother,74,14
9354,Robin,9, He moved there for business.,2,How I Met Your Mother,29,5
9357,Barney,9," You, you got something to say to me?",2,How I Met Your Mother,37,8
9358,Marshall,9, What are you talking about? Barney,2,How I Met Your Mother,35,6
9359,Marshall,9, How could you possibly know that?,2,How I Met Your Mother,34,6
9362,Marshall,9," Uh, let's see. Uh, first, I took the subway to school, and I got a bagel. Then I went to the library and found out Robin was never married. Crazy. And then I was hungry again so I went down to the vending machine...",2,How I Met Your Mother,216,44
9365,Marshall,9, You told him? Lily,2,How I Met Your Mother,19,4
9366,Barney,9, Don't count on it. I've been practicing on a tree trunk.,2,How I Met Your Mother,57,11
9367,Lily,9, Barney gets three slaps.,2,How I Met Your Mother,25,4
9368,Marshall,9, Three?,2,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
9369,Lily,9, One because you lied. And two for being prematurely slapped. Three slaps.,2,How I Met Your Mother,74,12
9371,Barney,9, Oh my God. Are you gonna cry? Marshall,2,How I Met Your Mother,39,8
9374,Ted,9, I just don't think it's healthy to keep big secrets in a relationship. My parents didn't really talk to each other for thirty years and now they're divorced.,2,How I Met Your Mother,158,28
9375,Robin,9," I have shared more of myself with you than I have ever shared with anyone. I'm asking for this one secret, which has nothing to do with us, to just be mine.",2,How I Met Your Mother,157,32
9377,Barney,9, So I just got a very interesting phone call.,2,How I Met Your Mother,45,9
9378,Ted,9, What are you talking about?,2,How I Met Your Mother,28,5
9379,Barney,9, I know Robin's secret.,2,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
9380,Robin,9, What?,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
9381,Barney,9," That's right, I know your secret, Robin. Or should I say Robin Sparkles? Robin",2,How I Met Your Mother,79,14
9383,Barney,9," Gather around, Ted, you're gonna wanna see this.",2,How I Met Your Mother,49,8
9384,Ted,9, Yeah. No I don't.,2,How I Met Your Mother,18,4
9386,Barney,9, What?,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
9387,Ted,9, Robin wants to keep this a secret so it's gonna stay a secret.,2,How I Met Your Mother,63,13
9388,Barney,9," Yeah, it's not gonna stay a secret. You see, in my research, I came upon a certain gentleman in Malaysia who is in possession of a certain video tape. He just emailed me that it will be up and running on MySpace in about, right now!",2,How I Met Your Mother,233,46
9390,Barney,9," Robin's world is about to be turned upside-down. I mean, I'm guessing.",2,How I Met Your Mother,71,12
9391,Robin,9," Barney, don't, okay.",2,How I Met Your Mother,21,3
9392,Barney,9," Robin, please don't panic. I'm only going to show enough to prove to Marshall that I was right.",2,How I Met Your Mother,96,18
9393,Ted,9," No, Barney, I said we're not watching this.",2,How I Met Your Mother,44,8
9395,Robin,9," No, it's time. Look, I appreciate what you're trying to do but if it's out there, there's no point in trying to hide it anymore. Let's just watch it and be done with it.",2,How I Met Your Mother,170,34
9397,Lily,9, Are you as terrified as I am?,2,How I Met Your Mother,30,7
9398,Marshall,9, I don't wanna get slapped again.,2,How I Met Your Mother,33,6
9399,Robin,9, I wanna stress that I was young.,2,How I Met Your Mother,33,7
9400,Barney,9, Yeah you were.,2,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
9401,Robin,9, And I didn't know any better.,2,How I Met Your Mother,30,6
9402,Barney,9, They never do.,2,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
9403,Robin,9, And it started out as an innocent modeling job.,2,How I Met Your Mother,48,9
9404,Barney,9, It always does.,2,How I Met Your Mother,16,3
9409,Ted,9, Oh my God.,2,How I Met Your Mother,11,3
9410,Barney,9," Well, obviously, I've been proven right, so in the interest of Robin's dignity, I won't show anymore. Plus, it's getting late. It's already slap o'clock.",2,How I Met Your Mother,154,25
9412,Robin,9, What the hell was that?,2,How I Met Your Mother,24,5
9413,Ted,9," I slap bet Marshall that you did p0rn, so I win.",2,How I Met Your Mother,49,11
9414,Robin,9," p0rn? I wish it was p0rn, it would be less embarrassing.",2,How I Met Your Mother,57,11
9420,Robin,9, I was a teenage pop star in Canada.,2,How I Met Your Mother,36,8
9422,Lily,9, This is the most amazing thing I've ever seen.,2,How I Met Your Mother,47,9
9423,Marshall,9, That's you?,2,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
9424,Robin,9, Yes. I had one minor hit. I had to go all over Canada and sing this song in malls. For a whole year I lived off of Orange Juliuses and Wetzel's Pretzels.,2,How I Met Your Mother,154,32
9426,Marshall,9, This is the 90's. Why does it look like 1986?,2,How I Met Your Mother,46,10
9427,Robin,9, The 80's didn't come to Canada till like '93.,2,How I Met Your Mother,46,9
9428,Marshall,9," Taking a break from the first of many viewings, I can't help but notice that this isn't p0rn.",2,How I Met Your Mother,94,18
9429,Lily,9, And yet a slap occurred without the permission of the Slap Bet Commissioner.,2,How I Met Your Mother,77,13
9430,Marshall,9, Looks like someone suffered from premature slapulation,2,How I Met Your Mother,55,7
9431,Ted,9," Oh my God, Robin's rapping. Guys, Robin's rapping.",2,How I Met Your Mother,51,8
9433,Lily,9," OK, I'm going to give you a choice. Either ten slaps right now in a row or five slaps that can be doled at any point from here to eternity.",2,How I Met Your Mother,140,30
9435,Ted,9, Go with the 10 now.,2,How I Met Your Mother,20,5
9436,Robin,9," No, wait, why get 10 when you can get 5?",2,How I Met Your Mother,41,10
9437,Ted,9," Yeah, but the constant fear of knowing that at any moment you can get slapped in the face would drive you crazy.",2,How I Met Your Mother,113,22
9438,Barney,9, I'm gonna go with the five for eternity.,2,How I Met Your Mother,41,8
9439,Robin,9, Good call.,2,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
9440,Ted,9, Horrible call.,2,How I Met Your Mother,15,2
9442,Marshall,9," Relax, dude, I'm just going for my soda, man. Take it easy. This is gonna be fun.",2,How I Met Your Mother,82,17
9444,Lily,9," So, just to be clear, you wanted everybody to go to the mall today?",2,How I Met Your Mother,68,14
9445,Barney,9," Wow, we're gonna watch this a lot. Robin",2,How I Met Your Mother,41,8
9446,Ted,9," Hey, just so you know, 16-year-old me would have been all over you. You could have been the girlfriend in Canada I told everyone I had. Hey, I'm really sorry I pried this out of you. I probably should have left it alone.",2,How I Met Your Mother,221,43
9447,Robin,9," You know what, you know me better now. That feels kinda nice.",2,How I Met Your Mother,62,12
9451,Marshall,9, That's one.,2,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
9453,Barney,9, Did you have to laugh like that every time? Robin,2,How I Met Your Mother,50,10
9456,Marshall,9, The robot! Hey!,2,How I Met Your Mother,16,3
9459,Ted,9," No, she doesn't wanna wait.",2,How I Met Your Mother,28,5
9461,Ted,10," Kids, there's nothing more wonderful than New York City in the winter... except the view of New York City in the winter through your apartment window.In the winter of 2006, Marshall, Lily, Robin and I were all deep in couple hibernation mode. Sadly, this left Uncle Barney out in the cold.",2,How I Met Your Mother,290,51
9463,Barney,10," Okay. All-night rave, abandoned tire factory in Newark. We're on the list. Who's in?",2,How I Met Your Mother,85,14
9464,Ted,10, - Nope.,2,How I Met Your Mother,8,2
9465,Robin,10, - No.,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,2
9467,Barney,10," Private jet. Teeterboro Airport, skinny-skydiving. Who's in?",2,How I Met Your Mother,61,7
9468,Ted,10, - Nope.,2,How I Met Your Mother,8,2
9471,Barney,10," One beer. Bar, downstairs, 15 second walk. Who's in?",2,How I Met Your Mother,53,9
9472,Marshall,10, Shh... Lily went sleepy-bye.,2,How I Met Your Mother,29,4
9473,Ted,10," It got so bad, Barney tried to be his own wingman.",2,How I Met Your Mother,51,11
9475,Barney,10,  Hi. Have you met me?,2,How I Met Your Mother,22,5
9476,Ted,10," Finally, he decided to bring in reinforcements.",2,How I Met Your Mother,48,7
9479,Barney,10," Yes. And do you know why? Hang on to your bedsores, grandparents from Willy Wonka, because guess who's on his way up to this apartment right now? My... wait for it... brother, James. React.",2,How I Met Your Mother,190,34
9481,Robin,10, - You have a brother?,2,How I Met Your Mother,22,5
9482,Barney,10," - Yeah. He's the awesome-est, most best looking-est, greatest guy ever.",2,How I Met Your Mother,72,11
9483,Lily,10, He's exactly like Barney.,2,How I Met Your Mother,26,4
9484,Barney,10, That's what I just said.,2,How I Met Your Mother,25,5
9485,Ted,10," Well, Barney and his brother aren't exactly alike. James is gay.",2,How I Met Your Mother,65,11
9486,Robin,10," Really? I never in a million years would I picture you with a gay brother, that's awesome.",2,How I Met Your Mother,91,17
9487,Ted,10," Yeah. I just wanted you to have a heads up, so you don't act all surprised when he gets here.",2,How I Met Your Mother,94,20
9491,Robin,10, Thanks for the heads up.,2,How I Met Your Mother,25,5
9493,Robin,10," How in God's name did it never come up that Barney has a gay, black brother?",2,How I Met Your Mother,77,16
9494,Ted,10," Is he black? I guess I'm the kind of person that focuses on who people are on the inside rather than the color of their skin. I'm kidding, I just wanted to see your face.",2,How I Met Your Mother,171,35
9495,Marshall,10," Yeah, so now the wedding's back on.",2,How I Met Your Mother,36,7
9496,Lily,10," Anyway, James, how have you been?",2,How I Met Your Mother,34,6
9498,Barney,10," Is ""gimme five"" back?",2,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
9500,Barney,10," Guys, ""gimme five"" is back!",2,How I Met Your Mother,28,5
9501,Ted,10," Oh, James, this is my girlfriend, Robin.",2,How I Met Your Mother,41,7
9502,Robin,10, - Hey. It's so nice to meet you.,2,How I Met Your Mother,33,8
9504,Robin,10," So, I have to ask, there's a story here.",2,How I Met Your Mother,41,9
9507,Ted,10," The truth is, Barney and James got a lot of... different explanations from their mom over the years.",2,How I Met Your Mother,101,18
9516,Ted,10, So what are you guys gonna do tonight?,2,How I Met Your Mother,39,8
9517,Barney,10," I'll tell you what James is gonna do. He's gonna do the job you've been neglecting. And, as always, he'll do it a lot better than you ever did. Ted... James is my wingman now.",2,How I Met Your Mother,176,35
9518,Ted,10, Okay.,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
9519,Marshall,10," Last time James was in town, Barney got slapped once, lucky twice, and... whose penthouse hot tub did you end up in?",2,How I Met Your Mother,117,22
9521,Lily,10, And then there was the time they scored the brother/sister combo.,2,How I Met Your Mother,66,11
9522,Barney,10, It was everything we ever dreamed of when watching Donnie and Marie. She was a little bit country.,2,How I Met Your Mother,99,18
9529,Ted,10, And Barney always returned the favor.,2,How I Met Your Mother,38,6
9530,Barney,10," Help, I don't think he's breathing. Does anyone know mouth-to-mouth?",2,How I Met Your Mother,69,10
9532,Barney,10,"  Okay, great. How 'bout you instead?",2,How I Met Your Mother,37,6
9534,Barney,10," Oh, man, I am so excited that you're here! It has been forever since I have been around anyone even remotely fun. Uh, yes offense.",2,How I Met Your Mother,131,25
9536,Ted,10, - No.,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,2
9537,Lily,10, - Jammies.,2,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
9538,Marshall,10, Tonight? It's after 9,2,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
9548,Ted,10," So that night, Barney got his wish. We all went out.",2,How I Met Your Mother,53,11
9550,Barney,10," Daddy's home! Yeah. All right, bro. What do you like? Guy in super tight black T? Super tight black guy? Guy who looks like Mr. T?",2,How I Met Your Mother,131,26
9552,Barney,10, I'm feeling lazy. How 'bout girl with the chocolatini?,2,How I Met Your Mother,55,9
9554,Barney,10, - Let's ride.,2,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
9557,Barney,10," - Hey! Hey! Her body art is not an invitation to grope her, it's an expression of her inner self. I'm sure, in many ways, she is the dolphin encircled by flowers.",2,How I Met Your Mother,163,32
9559,Barney,10, - What? What?,2,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
9561,Barney,10, Let me know if he bothers you again.,2,How I Met Your Mother,37,8
9563,Barney,10, Sure. If it'll make you feel safer. I'm Barney.,2,How I Met Your Mother,48,9
9564,Ted,10," Now, kids, when you're out at a noisy, crowded bar, you can always tell the difference between the singles and the couples. You just have to look for the signs.",2,How I Met Your Mother,161,30
9566,Barney,10, - Boiling hot.,2,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
9567,Ted,10, Singles stay on their feet for maneuverability.,2,How I Met Your Mother,48,7
9570,Barney,10," Oh, hello. Have a drink.",2,How I Met Your Mother,25,5
9572,Ted,10," Couples, exhausted by the sheer act of leaving the house, are obsessed with finding a place to sit down. There are a lot of other indicators, too. From choice of social lubricant...to basic body language. But the point is, there are many ways to tell whether someone has Single Stamina or Couples Coma.",2,How I Met Your Mother,303,53
9574,Lily,10, I miss my jammies. I can't believe I wore a bra for this.,2,How I Met Your Mother,58,13
9575,Robin,10, Bras suck. They're so confining and unnatural.,2,How I Met Your Mother,47,7
9576,Lily,10," Yeah, they're like a boobie zoo.",2,How I Met Your Mother,33,6
9578,Lily,10," Oh, please go sweat on someone else.",2,How I Met Your Mother,37,7
9579,Marshall,10, Poor guy.,2,How I Met Your Mother,10,2
9580,Lily,10, Poor guy? Poor my boobs.,2,How I Met Your Mother,25,5
9581,Marshall,10," Well, it takes a lot of guts to approach a girl and you just crushed him.",2,How I Met Your Mother,74,16
9582,Lily,10," Oh, yeah, yeah. He looks all broken up inside.",2,How I Met Your Mother,47,9
9583,Robin,10," Whatever, you guys have no idea what it's like to be on the receiving end.",2,How I Met Your Mother,75,15
9584,Ted,10," ""Oh, poor me. I'm a pretty girl and everybody everywhere wants to buy me drinks and have s*x with me."" Waa.",2,How I Met Your Mother,108,21
9585,Marshall,10," ""Oh, poor me. I get to order yummy, pink drinks with chunks of real fruit that guys secretly like, but can't order because they'll be made fun of.""",2,How I Met Your Mother,148,28
9586,Ted,10, - Dude.,2,How I Met Your Mother,8,2
9587,Marshall,10, - They're delicious!,2,How I Met Your Mother,21,3
9590,Lily,10," You know, that was, like, the third hot guy that James blew off tonight.",2,How I Met Your Mother,73,14
9591,Marshall,10," Yeah, he's turning down shots, he's yawning, he's whining about his feet. He's as bad as we are.",2,How I Met Your Mother,97,18
9592,Ted,10," He is. Wait, he's exactly as bad as we are. You guys don't think that James is... in a relationship?",2,How I Met Your Mother,101,20
9593,Robin,10, No. There's no way. He's Barney's brother.,2,How I Met Your Mother,43,7
9594,Marshall,10, Look at that. He's texting!,2,How I Met Your Mother,28,5
9595,Ted,10," Oh, my God! He is in a couple.",2,How I Met Your Mother,31,8
9596,Lily,10, This is gonna kill Barney.,2,How I Met Your Mother,27,5
9597,Barney,10, What's gonna kill me? What's going on?,2,How I Met Your Mother,39,7
9598,Marshall,10, B-Barney? Have you noticed anything...different about James?,2,How I Met Your Mother,61,7
9599,Barney,10," No. I mean, he's glowing from his peel, if that's what you mean.",2,How I Met Your Mother,65,13
9600,Ted,10," We have reason to believe that James is, uh, maybe hiding something from you. I-I know you're not gonna like hearing this, but... Barney... your brother is...monogamous.",2,How I Met Your Mother,170,27
9601,Barney,10," That's ridiculous! Just because he's a little sleepy, and he hasn't had s*x with anyone in a bathroom stall... He hasn't had s*x with anyone in a bathroom stall.",2,How I Met Your Mother,162,29
9602,Robin,10," And, Barney... I hate to be the one to tell you this, but... he's texting.",2,How I Met Your Mother,75,15
9603,Barney,10," No, he... No! That... is impossible. Excuse... Excuse... Ex...",2,How I Met Your Mother,63,9
9605,Barney,10, Don't change the subject. Let me see your phone.,2,How I Met Your Mother,49,9
9607,Barney,10, I just want to see your phone. Let me see your phone.,2,How I Met Your Mother,54,12
9609,Barney,10, I got... Who is this? And the answer better be,2,How I Met Your Mother,47,10
9614,Barney,10, I don't support this.,2,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
9616,Barney,10," Not gay marriage-- marriage! How can you do this?We were raised in the same house, with the same values!",2,How I Met Your Mother,105,19
9618,Barney,10," Oh, God. Is that what you two do together? You sit around the house and talk about love? I think... I'm gonna be sick.",2,How I Met Your Mother,119,24
9620,Barney,10, What? No way.,2,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
9624,Barney,10," Oh, it's a freaking epidemic.",2,How I Met Your Mother,30,5
9626,Lily,10," Oh, sweetie! Did you make that for me?",2,How I Met Your Mother,39,8
9627,Marshall,10, Yes.,2,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
9628,Barney,10," Clam Bake. Staten Island. Who's in? Okay, I didn't have high hopes for that one. Okay, here's my thing. If gay guys start getting married, then suddenly the whole world's gonna be doing it. That's how it works. They start something, then six months later, everyone follows. Like now everyone gets manicures.",2,How I Met Your Mother,308,52
9629,Ted,10, I don't get manicures.,2,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
9630,Barney,10," Okay, then like how... Like getting your chest waxed.",2,How I Met Your Mother,54,9
9631,Lily,10, You get your chest waxed?,2,How I Met Your Mother,26,5
9632,Barney,10," You know what I mean! Gay marriage is going to cause single life, as we know it, to die out. Think of how the American family will be strengthened.",2,How I Met Your Mother,148,29
9633,Marshall,10," Barney, I'm sorry you're upset, but you got to suck it up and be a man about this.",2,How I Met Your Mother,83,18
9634,Barney,10," No. It's always been me and him together, being awesome, while the rest of you walked two-by-two onto your ark of sexless boredom.",2,How I Met Your Mother,131,23
9635,Marshall,10, Just because James is getting married doesn't mean things are going to change.,2,How I Met Your Mother,79,13
9636,Barney,10, Yeah. Like things haven't changed with you people.,2,How I Met Your Mother,51,8
9637,Ted,10," Look, my sister married a guy I didn't like. Sandals and socks--come on, buddy. But I took her out, we celebrated. It was the right thing to do. You got to support him.",2,How I Met Your Mother,169,33
9638,Barney,10," You're right, Ted. This is a cause for celebration. We need to take him out and celebrate the commitment he and Tom are about to make.",2,How I Met Your Mother,135,26
9641,Barney,10," What? Yeah! See, that cage represents your commitment.",2,How I Met Your Mother,55,8
9642,Marshall,10," Oh, my God. Freedom has never tasted so delicious.",2,How I Met Your Mother,51,9
9644,Marshall,10, I do. And thank you for noticing. You're obviously in very good shape yourself.,2,How I Met Your Mother,80,14
9646,Marshall,10," You know what? I'm very flattered, and, objectively, you're a very attractive man, but this is actually my fiancí©e.",2,How I Met Your Mother,117,19
9648,Marshall,10," No, no, this isn't my drink. This is hers.",2,How I Met Your Mother,43,9
9649,Lily,10," No, it isn't.",2,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
9651,Ted,10," Oh, I'm straight, too. But I thank you for your time, and I appreciate your interest in my body.",2,How I Met Your Mother,97,19
9652,Marshall,10," You see that? Being hit on doesn't have to be terrible. I feel flattered, and everyone left with their dignity.",2,How I Met Your Mother,112,20
9654,Robin,10," Wow. You actually do, don't you? You're not checking out my boobs or anything.",2,How I Met Your Mother,79,14
9656,Robin,10, I love this place! Let's dance!,2,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
9657,Lily,10,  - And not be groped!,2,How I Met Your Mother,22,5
9658,Robin,10, - Whoo! Thank you.,2,How I Met Your Mother,19,4
9660,Ted,10, - Thank you!,2,How I Met Your Mother,13,3
9661,Marshall,10, - We're hot.,2,How I Met Your Mother,13,3
9662,Ted,10, - Totally.,2,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
9664,Barney,10, Sounds like you really rocked that arts and crafts fair.,2,How I Met Your Mother,57,10
9666,Barney,10," And I cannot wait for you to meet my good friend... this guy. Excuse me, do you know anyone who would like to buy my incredibly muscular, fun, large-handed brother a drink?",2,How I Met Your Mother,173,32
9668,Barney,10," Okay, I'm in. Which one am I?",2,How I Met Your Mother,30,7
9670,Barney,10," He's very shy, loves tennis and Brazil, and drops his pants after three dirty martinis. Now go, man, go!",2,How I Met Your Mother,105,19
9671,Marshall,10, I just never thought I'd see Barney so vulnerable.,2,How I Met Your Mother,51,9
9672,Ted,10," Well, I guess no one wants to feel like they're going through the world alone.",2,How I Met Your Mother,79,15
9674,Marshall,10," Okay, we're actually right in the middle of something right now, so...",2,How I Met Your Mother,71,12
9676,Ted,10," God, can't two straight guys come to a gay dance club, enjoy some techno and good conversation without being bothered?",2,How I Met Your Mother,119,20
9677,Robin,10," How's it going, guys? Still enjoying the attentions of men?",2,How I Met Your Mother,60,10
9678,Marshall,10," That's like the eighth guy who's hit on us in ten minutes. It's like, hello,",2,How I Met Your Mother,77,15
9680,Ted,10, And it's never the hot ones. It's always the losers. Bums me out!,2,How I Met Your Mother,66,13
9681,Lily,10, Looks like the boys learned their lesson. Do you totally miss being hit on?,2,How I Met Your Mother,76,14
9682,Robin,10," Oh, totally. Let's go find a sports bar.",2,How I Met Your Mother,41,8
9683,Barney,10," James, James, since you like arts and crafts, look at what Charles here made with cherry stems. He did it with his tongue. Yeah.",2,How I Met Your Mother,129,24
9685,Barney,10," So, Charles, why don't you put your number in my brother's phone, and once he's in a funner mood...",2,How I Met Your Mother,100,19
9691,Barney,10," Oh, so now it's my way of life? I thought it was our way of life. You've completely turned your back on it. Look at you, not even suited up. Do you remember why we suit up, James?",2,How I Met Your Mother,180,38
9693,Barney,10," To show people that we are different from the millions of T-shirt and jeans lemmings out there. The suit shows that we are a force to be reckoned with, a two-person army that plays by its own rules. But you've taken off the uniform, you've crossed enemy lines, and you've abandoned me. Well, I'm not gonna let you do that. It's not too late to back out of this stupid marriage thing! You don't have to do this, bro!",2,How I Met Your Mother,416,79
9695,Barney,10, - Why?!,2,How I Met Your Mother,8,2
9697,Barney,10, What? There's gonna be a baby?,2,How I Met Your Mother,31,6
9699,Barney,10," Oh, my God. I'm gonna be an uncle?",2,How I Met Your Mother,35,8
9703,Barney,10, To James and Tom. May you have a long and happy life together. And may I always have the skin and libido of a much younger man.- Cheers.,2,How I Met Your Mother,137,28
9705,Barney,10, Thanks. I decided to leave out the hetero college phase. No one wants to,2,How I Met Your Mother,73,14
9707,Lily,10, It was perfect. You even made Tom's dad cry. Might have been doing that because he's a Republican.,2,How I Met Your Mother,99,18
9708,Marshall,10, Whoa. It's 9,2,How I Met Your Mother,13,3
9709,Ted,10," Uh, no, I think I'm gonna stay a little bit longer.",2,How I Met Your Mother,52,11
9710,Robin,10," Yeah, me, too. I'm not tired at all.",2,How I Met Your Mother,37,8
9711,Marshall,10," All right, well, it's getting late. Got to get the wife home.",2,How I Met Your Mother,62,12
9712,Lily,10," Oh, stop calling me that. It makes me sound fat.",2,How I Met Your Mother,49,10
9713,Barney,10," Ugh, it's a freaking epidemic.",2,How I Met Your Mother,31,5
9715,Barney,10, - May I?,2,How I Met Your Mother,9,3
9718,Barney,10," Hey, buddy. Your parents are married. Now, listen, you. Just because you're being raised by married people doesn't mean you have to choose that lifestyle. High-five. Luckily, you got me. In 20 and a half years, you'll be 21, and I will be... Well, I haven't decided how old I'll be yet. But we are gonna bro out, uncle and nephew style. Stick with me, kid. I am gonna teach you how to live. Great suit, by the way. Who is the cutest?",2,How I Met Your Mother,434,83
9721,Barney,10," Rosa, why always be attracted to the unavailable ones? Why not accept the fact that you're a beautiful woman who is worthy of love? Are you brave enough to hear that? You...",2,How I Met Your Mother,174,32
9722,Ted,11," Kids, as you know, Christmas is a time you spend with your family. So in December of 2006, I had three options. Spend it with my mom and her new boyfriend Clint, spend it with my dad and his new girlfriend micro-brewing, or head down to Staten Island to spend it with my super religious cousin Stacy and her family. So I opted for none of the above and decided to spend Christmas 2006 in Manhattan... celebrating with my other family.",2,How I Met Your Mother,435,81
9724,Marshall,11," Okay, I have one last paper due at 5",2,How I Met Your Mother,37,9
9725,Ted,11," Dude, open your eyes. You're going to hurt yourself.",2,How I Met Your Mother,53,9
9726,Marshall,11," No, no. Christmas Eve winter wonderland is my reward for finishing my paper. Baby, do I smell your Sinfully Cinnamon Cookies?",2,How I Met Your Mother,126,21
9727,Lily,11, Yes.,2,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
9728,Marshall,11," Damn me and my heightened other senses. Must be strong. Okay, I'll be back here at 5",2,How I Met Your Mother,85,17
9729,Lily,11," Hey, look. Our old answering machine.",2,How I Met Your Mother,38,6
9730,Ted,11," Oh, yeah. After you left, we, uh, we unplugged it because it reminded Marshall of how you used to, you know, leave messages. But hey, you guys are back together. I say we're plugging it back in. It's good to have you back.",2,How I Met Your Mother,223,43
9731,Lily,11," Thanks. Oh, hey, look, there's still some messages on here.",2,How I Met Your Mother,60,10
9734,Ted,11," Yes, same Clint.",2,How I Met Your Mother,17,3
9735,Ted,11," Hey, Marshall. Are you lying on the couch right now moping about Lily? You are, aren't you? Well, stop it. She's not worth it. You gotta get over that Grinch.",2,How I Met Your Mother,159,30
9736,Ted,11," But I didn't say ""Grinch."" I said a bad word. A very, very bad word.",2,How I Met Your Mother,69,15
9737,Ted,11," Oh, fudge.",2,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
9738,Ted,11, But I didn't say fudge.,2,How I Met Your Mother,24,5
9739,Lily,11, I'm... a what?,2,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
9740,Ted,11," I-- That was Barney, that was Barney.",2,How I Met Your Mother,38,7
9741,Lily,11," That was you, Ted.",2,How I Met Your Mother,19,4
9742,Ted,11, That was Marshall.,2,How I Met Your Mother,19,3
9743,Lily,11, Marshall left a message for Marshall?,2,How I Met Your Mother,38,6
9744,Ted,11," You know, it may have been me, but it was so long ago. Man, that machine, it really garbles your voice.You know, it almost made it sound like I said...",2,How I Met Your Mother,152,30
9745,Lily,11, Why would you call me that?,2,How I Met Your Mother,28,6
9746,Ted,11, It was a fair question. Marshall's breakup with Lily had sent him into a deep depression and nothing could get him out of it. Until one day...,2,How I Met Your Mother,143,27
9748,Marshall,11, She was perfect. I lost the perfect woman. I should have knocked her up when I had the chance.,2,How I Met Your Mother,95,19
9749,Ted,11, Okay. That's it. You're never going to get over her until you stop putting her on a pedestal. So no more ice cream until you tell me one thing that's wrong with Lily.,2,How I Met Your Mother,167,33
9750,Marshall,11, There's only one of her?,2,How I Met Your Mother,25,5
9751,Ted,11, Okay. She called off your wedding and dumped you to be a painter in San Francisco. What do you call that?,2,How I Met Your Mother,106,21
9752,Marshall,11, Fiercely independent? Brave? I guess it was a little selfish.,2,How I Met Your Mother,62,10
9753,Ted,11, There you go.,2,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
9754,Ted,11," And in almost no time, that spark turned into a roaring fire.",2,How I Met Your Mother,62,12
9756,Marshall,11," Yeah. No, you're right. Lily would laugh at anything.",2,How I Met Your Mother,54,9
9757,Barney,11," She'd give it up for a bad pun. I'm telling you, she's a laugh slut.",2,How I Met Your Mother,69,15
9758,Ted,11," Remember that time we heard her laughing and we thought she was watching Weekend At Bernie's, but it turned out she was watching Weekend At Bernie's 2?",2,How I Met Your Mother,152,27
9759,Barney,11," And her art? ""I'm Lily, I'm an artist."" She doesn't even own a beret.",2,How I Met Your Mother,70,14
9760,Marshall,11," Yeah, and if she's such a great ""artist,"" why does she suck at Pictionary? Who draws a ninja star like a Star of David? Right, right?",2,How I Met Your Mother,134,26
9761,Ted,11, Yeah!,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
9762,Marshall,11, Another round!,2,How I Met Your Mother,15,2
9764,Ted,11, I was trying to help him. I'm his best friend. That's the best friend's job.,2,How I Met Your Mother,77,15
9765,Lily,11, The best friend's job is to call me that word?,2,How I Met Your Mother,47,10
9766,Ted,11, Yeah.,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
9768,Robin,11," Oh, Ted. Oh, Teddy boy.",2,How I Met Your Mother,24,5
9769,Ted,11," Why is this such a big deal? It's just a word. We use lots of words, every day. It shouldn't be any different than any other word.",2,How I Met Your Mother,131,27
9770,Barney,11, Then why don't you say it now?,2,How I Met Your Mother,31,7
9771,Ted,11, Grinch. You timed that didn't you?,2,How I Met Your Mother,35,6
9772,Barney,11, Perfectly.,2,How I Met Your Mother,11,1
9773,Robin,11," Well, at least you apologized. You apologized, didn't you?",2,How I Met Your Mother,59,9
9774,Ted,11," Oh, yeah. ""I'm sorry"" were the first words out of my mouth.",2,How I Met Your Mother,60,12
9776,Ted,11," I'm sorry, but I am not apologizing. I was just trying to put the guy back together. You smashed him to pieces.",2,How I Met Your Mother,112,22
9777,Lily,11, Are you seriously not going to apologize for leaving that message?,2,How I Met Your Mother,67,11
9778,Ted,11, No!,2,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
9779,Lily,11, Why not?,2,How I Met Your Mother,9,2
9780,Ted,11," Because, Lily, this summer, you were kind of a Grinch.",2,How I Met Your Mother,55,10
9781,Lily,11," Oh, you'll be sorry, Ted Mosby.",2,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
9783,Barney,11, Ted Vivian Mosby!,2,How I Met Your Mother,18,3
9784,Ted,11, That's not my middle name.,2,How I Met Your Mother,27,5
9785,Barney,11, Do you kiss your mother with that mouth?,2,How I Met Your Mother,41,8
9786,Ted,11, Like you've never said that word.,2,How I Met Your Mother,34,6
9787,Barney,11, I don't kiss your mother with my mouth. Yet. ,2,How I Met Your Mother,46,9
9788,Ted,11, Are you sick?,2,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
9789,Barney,11, Is it sick to find maturity and experience sexy?,2,How I Met Your Mother,49,9
9790,Ted,11," No, I meant do you have a cold?",2,How I Met Your Mother,32,8
9791,Barney,11," I'm fine. I'm fine. My nose is just overflowing with awesome and I had to get some of it out. Now, if you'll excuse me, the holidays are a time when people are lonely and desperate. It's the most wonderful time of the year.",2,How I Met Your Mother,224,44
9792,Ted,11, I should go apologize. It's Christmas Eve.,2,How I Met Your Mother,43,7
9793,Robin,11," Yeah. I mean, slamming doors and screaming curses? If I wanted that, I would have gone home for the holidays.",2,How I Met Your Mother,110,20
9795,Barney,11," I don't see any mistletoe, but... ",2,How I Met Your Mother,35,6
9797,Barney,11," Uh... ""Bless you"" would have been nice.",2,How I Met Your Mother,40,7
9799,Robin,11, You're sick.,2,How I Met Your Mother,13,2
9800,Barney,11, I'm not sick.,2,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
9801,Robin,11, You're sick.,2,How I Met Your Mother,13,2
9802,Barney,11, You know what? I am sick. Sick of you telling me I'm sick. What up?,2,How I Met Your Mother,68,15
9804,Ted,11," Ahh... Three flights of stairs, not a drop spilled. Hey, buddy.",2,How I Met Your Mother,64,11
9805,Robin,11, You sure this is gonna work?,2,How I Met Your Mother,29,6
9806,Ted,11," Yeah, this is our thing. In college, whenever I wanted to make up with her, I'd buy her a beer. Cute, right?",2,How I Met Your Mother,109,22
9807,Robin,11, Totally. Plus free mug.,2,How I Met Your Mother,24,4
9808,Ted,11," Usually that would've done the trick, but it turned out this was a problem not even alcohol could solve. Actually the beer helped a little.",2,How I Met Your Mother,140,25
9809,Ted,11, She took the decorations. She took the decorations! What a Grinch!,2,How I Met Your Mother,67,11
9810,Ted,11," That time I did say ""Grinch.""",2,How I Met Your Mother,30,6
9811,Ted,11," All right. I guess I have to call her, right? Lily's cell phone. She'll listen to reason-- right? Oh, hey, Billy. Actually, funny thing--the voice dial got you. I was trying to call... Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.  Yeah, the holidays are a rough time for everyone, Billy. Okay, yeah, dinner next Wednesday. Okay. Damn voice dial.",2,How I Met Your Mother,329,58
9812,Robin,11," Barney! What the hell are you doing? Get in here, it's freezing outside. Are you insane?",2,How I Met Your Mother,89,16
9813,Barney,11," Hey, blame Lily and her oppressive ""no cigars in the apartment rule."" God, it's like Marshall's marrying the Taliban. . High five.",2,How I Met Your Mother,131,22
9814,Robin,11, Eww. No. You have to go home and get to bed.,2,How I Met Your Mother,45,11
9815,Barney,11," Oh, Robin, my simple friend from the untamed north, let me tell you about a little thing I like to call mind over body. You see, whenever I start feeling sick, I just stop being sick and be awesome instead. True story. Yeah, in two minutes, I'm going to pound a sixer of Red Bull, hop in a cab, play a couple of hours of laser tag, maybe get a spray-on tan. It's gonna be legen... Wait for it... ",2,How I Met Your Mother,397,79
9816,Ted,11, Lily!,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1

9819,Lily,11, At my apartment.,2,How I Met Your Mother,17,3
9820,Ted,11, You want to bring them back so we can celebrate Christmas together-- please?,2,How I Met Your Mother,77,13
9821,Lily,11," Ted, do you know what I would do if one of my kindergartners used that kind of language? I would be on the phone with their parents.",2,How I Met Your Mother,133,27
9822,Ted,11," Yeah, I'm not a kindergartner.",2,How I Met Your Mother,31,5
9823,Lily,11, Exactly. You know what that word means. You know that calling people names is mean and hurtful... assface.,2,How I Met Your Mother,107,18
9824,Ted,11," Lily, if you don't bring that stuff back right now, we...",2,How I Met Your Mother,58,11
9826,Robin,11, She's just mad. She'll cool down.,2,How I Met Your Mother,34,6

9830,Ted,11, Damn it! I could be in Cleveland right now making peppermint lager with my dad.,2,How I Met Your Mother,80,15
9831,Robin,11, Where are you going?,2,How I Met Your Mother,21,4

9838,Ted,11, Oh... so magical.,2,How I Met Your Mother,18,3
9839,Marshall,11," When you walk through the door, does it feel like you've been slapped in the face by Christmas?",2,How I Met Your Mother,96,18
9840,Ted,11," Sure does. Look, I gotta go.",2,How I Met Your Mother,29,6
9841,Marshall,11," Come on, man, describe it! Tell me about the decorations. Is Rudolph there? He is, isn't he? Hi, Rudolph!",2,How I Met Your Mother,106,19
9842,Ted,11," Ah, yeah, but, you know... decorations, is that really what Christmas is about?",2,How I Met Your Mother,80,13
9843,Marshall,11," Hell, yeah! What else would it be about?",2,How I Met Your Mother,41,8
9844,Ted,11," Uh, try the birth of Christ. You know, Christmas-- Christ Mas, which means ""More Christ"" to our Spanish friends.",2,How I Met Your Mother,113,19
9845,Marshall,11," Yeah, well, all I know is walking in that door and seeing the winter wonderland and seeing Lily and all you guys, just... I can't wait.",2,How I Met Your Mother,136,26

9858,Ted,11," No, Mom, why would it be about Clint?",2,How I Met Your Mother,38,8
9860,Ted,11," Hey, Clint. Listen, um, I don't really have time to...",2,How I Met Your Mother,55,10
9864,Barney,11," This is a low moment for the Barnacle. I should be off playing laser tag right now, but instead... Don't look at me. I'm hideous.",2,How I Met Your Mother,130,25
9865,Robin,11, You just look like a regular guy.,2,How I Met Your Mother,34,7

9871,Robin,11," Fine, I'll feed you.",2,How I Met Your Mother,21,4
9872,Barney,11, Ouchie in my mouth! I don't want it. I want ice cream.,2,How I Met Your Mother,55,12

9885,Ted,11," Yeah, well, I brought a beer, but I gave it to a homeless guy. All right, he took it from me. Now, will you please come home?",2,How I Met Your Mother,126,27
9886,Lily,11," No, I'm not spending Christmas with you.",2,How I Met Your Mother,41,7
9887,Ted,11," Okay, I'm sorry for calling you a... that word, over the summer, and for saying it again today. And for thinking it a lot on the subway ride over. I had no right to say that. It was hurtful and immature and I'm sorry.",2,How I Met Your Mother,218,44
9888,Lily,11," Oh, shut up. You think I don't know your fake apologies by now, Ted Mosby? Huh? You're clearly still mad at me.",2,How I Met Your Mother,112,22
9889,Ted,11, I'm not mad at you.,2,How I Met Your Mother,20,5
9890,Lily,11," Yes, you are.",2,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
9891,Ted,11," I am not mad at you, Lily. Now, can we please just...",2,How I Met Your Mother,54,12
9892,Lily,11, I've apologized to Marshall and he's forgiven me and we've moved passed it. Why can't you?,2,How I Met Your Mother,91,16
9893,Ted,11," Because you never apologized to me. Marshall's not the only one you walked out on. You leave for three months, you don't even call. Come on, Lily, we're supposed to be friends!",2,How I Met Your Mother,177,32
9894,Lily,11," Yeah, some friend, you called me a Grinch.",2,How I Met Your Mother,43,8
9895,Ted,11, You were a Grinch!,2,How I Met Your Mother,19,4
9896,Lily,11, How can you...,2,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
9897,Ted,11," Grinchy, Grinch, Grinch, Grinch, Grinch, Grinch, Grinch.",2,How I Met Your Mother,57,7
9899,Lily,11," Happy? Now, you've pissed off the big guy upstairs.",2,How I Met Your Mother,52,9
9900,Ted,11," Yeah, I'm sure God cares if I...",2,How I Met Your Mother,33,7
9902,Lily,11," That's my super. He lives above me. Great. Thanks to your filthy mouth, now I'm going to have Christmas alone in the dark.",2,How I Met Your Mother,123,23
9903,Ted,11, Fine. I don't want to ruin Christmas. You can have the apartment. Don't worry about seeing me there I'll be in Staten Island with my cousin Stacy. Just.... Merry Christmas.,2,How I Met Your Mother,173,30
9905,Robin,11," You're spending Christmas Eve with your family? Baby, that sucks. I'm so sorry.",2,How I Met Your Mother,80,13
9906,Ted,11," Uh, they're fine. They're just... they're a little weird. You know they don't believe in gifts or Christmas trees. And they think Santa's how Satan spells his name when he wants to trick us.",2,How I Met Your Mother,191,34
9907,Robin,11," Well, do you want me to go with you?",2,How I Met Your Mother,37,9
9908,Ted,11, Was that a sincere offer?,2,How I Met Your Mother,26,5
9909,Robin,11, First tell me your answer.,2,How I Met Your Mother,27,5
9910,Ted,11," Stay there. Save yourself. We'll spend all day together tomorrow. Okay. Oh, how's Barney feeling?",2,How I Met Your Mother,98,15
9911,Robin,11," You mean the whiney bottomless pit of neediness? He was bugging me, so I spiked his echinacea tea with codeine.",2,How I Met Your Mother,112,20
9912,Ted,11, You're gonna be a great mom.,2,How I Met Your Mother,29,6
9914,Marshall,11," Holy crap, the magical Christmas season is upon us. And thank God we don't pay for utilities.",2,How I Met Your Mother,94,17
9915,Lily,11, Merry Christmas! What's in the box?,2,How I Met Your Mother,36,6
9916,Marshall,11, Only the best present for the best girl ever. It took me all day to track it down.,2,How I Met Your Mother,83,18
9917,Lily,11, I thought you were writing a paper.,2,How I Met Your Mother,36,7
9918,Marshall,11," Ah, naw, I blew that off. I'll get an extension. School's not important. What is that pitter patter on the roof? Could it be the sound of an awesome Christmas story about to come down the chimney? Why, yes, it is. 'Twas the day before Christmas...",2,How I Met Your Mother,248,46
9920,Marshall,11," It was supposed to arrive, like, five days ago, but then it got lost and rerouted. I checked two other branches, finally they told me it was here.",2,How I Met Your Mother,147,28
9922,Marshall,11," What?No, no, no, no,I need that package today.",2,How I Met Your Mother,47,8
9925,Marshall,11," Stop! Stop! Stop, please, stop. Stop. Stop the truck. I need a package on your truck. Can I please take a look in back?",2,How I Met Your Mother,120,24
9929,Marshall,11," I'm okay.  Hey, man, thanks for helping me make my fiancee's Christmas.",2,How I Met Your Mother,72,12
9931,Marshall,11," Wait, so some people aren't going to get their gifts in time for Christmas?",2,How I Met Your Mother,76,14
9934,Marshall,11," We delivered every single package on that truck. But I still have one package left to give. Yeah, I did. Merry Christmas. Open it, Baby.",2,How I Met Your Mother,137,25
9935,Lily,11," Okay. Oh, my God. An Easy Bake Oven! I've wanted one of these ever since I was a little girl. In this exact model. I never told you that. How did you know?",2,How I Met Your Mother,156,33
9937,Marshall,11, It's our first Christmas since we got back together. I want to get her something really special. So I'm getting her a jukebox.,2,How I Met Your Mother,127,23
9938,Ted,11," Wow, that's a great gift.",2,How I Met Your Mother,26,5
9939,Marshall,11, Not really. It's this big and it dispenses gum.,2,How I Met Your Mother,48,9
9940,Ted,11," Oh, man, I know something you could get her that would blow her mind. Ready? Eight years ago...",2,How I Met Your Mother,96,18
9942,Lily,11," When I was a kid, all I wanted was an Easy Bake Oven. I begged and I begged, but all I got was a stupid Lego set because my feminist mom didn't want me conforming to traditional gender roles.",2,How I Met Your Mother,192,39
9943,Ted,11, Easy Bake Oven--that's what I'm going to call my van.,2,How I Met Your Mother,54,10
9945,Ted,11, Dude... how was the concert?,2,How I Met Your Mother,29,5
9946,Marshall,11, I couldn't find the outside.,2,How I Met Your Mother,29,5
9948,Lily,11, I can't believe Ted remembered after all these years.,2,How I Met Your Mother,54,9
9949,Marshall,11," Yeah, and after all that weed. Where is he anyway?",2,How I Met Your Mother,51,10
9950,Lily,11, Staten Island.,2,How I Met Your Mother,15,2
9951,Marshall,11, Why?,2,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
9953,Ted,11," Okay, don't tell your mom, but I got you guys some presents.",2,How I Met Your Mother,61,12
9955,Ted,11," No, dude, real presents.",2,How I Met Your Mother,25,4
9960,Ted,11," Uh, you know what, why don't you say it. I really wouldn't know what to say.",2,How I Met Your Mother,77,16
9962,Ted,11," That's a great idea, Charity. But, really, I don't know. I mean how do you choose your favorite passage? It's the Bible; there's so many... great ones... That one from Pulp Fiction's pretty cool. Doorbell rings. Ooh, I'll get it. Charity, I'm tapping you in.",2,How I Met Your Mother,259,45
9966,Ted,11," Uh, it's... it's just, um, carolers. Marshall starts singing. Robin and Barney follow.",2,How I Met Your Mother,87,13
9968,Lily,11," I came here to apologize. I'm so sorry, Ted.",2,How I Met Your Mother,45,9
9969,Ted,11, I accept. Give me the beer. it is so good to see you guys.,2,How I Met Your Mother,59,14
9970,Lily,11, Are you coming home?,2,How I Met Your Mother,21,4
9971,Ted,11," Totally. But first, Lily, I owe you an apology.",2,How I Met Your Mother,48,9
9972,Lily,11," Oh, for the love of God, are you as sick of apologies as I am?",2,How I Met Your Mother,63,15
9973,Ted,11, Yes,2,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
9974,Lily,11, Can we just skip the apology and go straight to the forgiving?,2,How I Met Your Mother,63,12
9975,Ted,11," Yes. And I promise, I will never ever call you a... you know, again.",2,How I Met Your Mother,69,14
9976,Lily,11, That's okay. I was kind of a Grinch.,2,How I Met Your Mother,37,8
9978,Ted,11, Nothing. It's something you shouldn't say.,2,How I Met Your Mother,43,6
9982,Ted,11," Merry Christmas, everybody. Ted takes his coat and leaves  Run, run.",2,How I Met Your Mother,69,11
9984,Ted,12," Kids, you remember my first day with Robin.",2,How I Met Your Mother,44,8
9986,Ted,12, I think I'm in love with you.,2,How I Met Your Mother,30,7
9987,Robin,12, What?!,2,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
9989,Ted,12," Well, here's the thing, normal people, you know, people who aren't your dad, usually take longer to say ""I love you."" Robin went through the usual stages.",2,How I Met Your Mother,155,27
9991,Robin,12, Spider! Spider!,2,How I Met Your Mother,16,2
9992,Barney,12, I left something in the hallway.,2,How I Met Your Mother,33,6
9993,Ted,12, Where?,2,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
9994,Robin,12, Right there.,2,How I Met Your Mother,13,2
9995,Ted,12, Got it.,2,How I Met Your Mother,8,2
9997,Ted,12, First there's the moment when you think you think it.,2,How I Met Your Mother,54,10
9998,Ted,12," Whoa, still alive.",2,How I Met Your Mother,19,3
10000,Ted,12, There's the moment you think you know it.,2,How I Met Your Mother,42,8
10002,Robin,12," Oh, you don't want to kiss me, you'll get sick.",2,How I Met Your Mother,48,10
10004,Ted,12, Totally worth it.,2,How I Met Your Mother,18,3
10005,Ted,12," There's the moment where you know you know it, but you can't yet say it.",2,How I Met Your Mother,73,15
10006,Ted,12," All right, it's getting to be that time. I'll talk to you tomorrow?",2,How I Met Your Mother,68,13
10007,Robin,12, Good night.,2,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
10008,Ted,12, Good night.,2,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
10009,Robin,12," Wait, Ted?",2,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
10010,Ted,12, Yeah?,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
10011,Robin,12, Good night.,2,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
10013,Robin,12," Well, great, I'll see you then. Bye, sweetie.  Hey. Guess what? My sister Katie is coming to visit next weekend. She gets in on Thursday.",2,How I Met Your Mother,138,25
10014,Ted,12, That's awesome. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to take off work Friday. We're gonna take her to the Empire State Building.,2,How I Met Your Mother,133,25
10015,Robin,12, Really? You'd do that?,2,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
10016,Ted,12, Of course. Everyone should see the Empire State Building.,2,How I Met Your Mother,58,9
10017,Ted,12," And then there's the moment where you know you know it, and you can't keep it in any longer.",2,How I Met Your Mother,93,19
10019,Robin,12, Ted.,2,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
10020,Ted,12, Yeah?,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
10021,Robin,12, Falafel.,2,How I Met Your Mother,9,1
10023,Lily,12, Falafel?,2,How I Met Your Mother,9,1
10024,Robin,12, Falafel.,2,How I Met Your Mother,9,1
10025,Lily,12," Instead of telling Ted you love him, you said ""falafel""?",2,How I Met Your Mother,57,10
10026,Robin,12, I totally choked.,2,How I Met Your Mother,18,3
10027,Lily,12, I just don't get it. Why can't you tell Ted you love him?,2,How I Met Your Mother,58,13
10028,Robin,12," Oh, come on, this is a big deal for me.",2,How I Met Your Mother,40,10
10029,Lily,12," Oh, God, you'd think you never said it to a guy before. No.",2,How I Met Your Mother,60,13
10030,Robin,12," Okay, well, I don't usually getthis far in the relationship. I usually take the three-week exit.",2,How I Met Your Mother,97,16
10031,Lily,12, Don't tell me you're actually buying into Barney's freeway theory.,2,How I Met Your Mother,67,10
10033,Barney,12," Watch your steps when you get up, kids, 'cause I am about to drop some knowledge. Relationships are like a freeway.",2,How I Met Your Mother,116,21
10034,Marshall,12," Wait a minute, a month ago you told me relationships are like a traveling circus.",2,How I Met Your Mother,82,15
10035,Barney,12," No, this is new. This trumps that. Freeways have exits. So do relationships. The first exit, my personal favorite, is six hours in. You meet, you talk, you have s*x, you exit when she's in the shower.",2,How I Met Your Mother,201,37
10036,Robin,12," So every girl you have s*x with feels the immediate need to shower? Actually, yeah, I get that.",2,How I Met Your Mother,96,18
10037,Barney,12," The next exits are four days, three weeks, seven months--that's when you guys are gonna break up, mark your calendars.",2,How I Met Your Mother,119,20
10038,Ted,12, What?,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
10039,Barney,12," Then a year and a half, 18 years, and the last exit-- death. Which, if you've been with the same woman for your entire life, it's like, ""Are we there yet?""",2,How I Met Your Mother,156,31
10041,Robin,12," So I've never been on the freeway this long before. I mean, usually by now I find out the guy has some weird personality thing that makes me want to take the next exit.",2,How I Met Your Mother,169,34
10042,Lily,12," Yeah, been there. I once dated a guy who could only go to the bathroom when classical music was playing. Okay, it was Marshall.",2,How I Met Your Mother,128,24
10043,Robin,12, It's just things are going so well with Ted I just don't want to complicate it.,2,How I Met Your Mother,80,16
10044,Lily,12," Relax, it'll happen when it happens. Which is also the advice I gave Marshall to get him over the classical music thing.",2,How I Met Your Mother,121,22
10045,Robin,12," Oh, here comes Katie.",2,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
10046,Lily,12," Aw, your sister's so cute.",2,How I Met Your Mother,27,5
10047,Robin,12," Yeah. This reminds me of when I used to see her coming up the driveway from school, with her little pigtails and her Hello Kitty backpack.",2,How I Met Your Mother,139,26
10049,Lily,12," Hello, Kitty.",2,How I Met Your Mother,14,2
10050,Robin,12," Oh, no. No. No. No.",2,How I Met Your Mother,20,5
10052,Robin,12," Oh, good. Good. So, who is this... tongue person?",2,How I Met Your Mother,50,9
10055,Robin,12," Oh, you said that. Great. So how long have you two been...?",2,How I Met Your Mother,60,12
10060,Robin,12, That's cool. This is my friend Lily.,2,How I Met Your Mother,37,7
10062,Robin,12," You say things! Well, come on, let's get you back to my place, we'll get you settled.",2,How I Met Your Mother,86,17
10064,Robin,12," Uh, no, you're not.",2,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
10066,Robin,12, What? Oh. Oh...,2,How I Met Your Mother,16,3
10068,Robin,12, I can't believe my baby sister is planning to lose her virginity to a......douche with a faux hawk. This can't happen. You guys have to help me talk her out of it.,2,How I Met Your Mother,164,32
10069,Marshall,12, Speech to talk a girl out of having s*x.,2,How I Met Your Mother,41,9
10070,Ted,12," Yeah, I don't have any of those.",2,How I Met Your Mother,33,7
10071,Barney,12, Discouraging premarital s*x is against my religion.,2,How I Met Your Mother,52,7
10072,Robin,12, Please? I'm her older sister. I'm supposed to teach her how to make good and responsible decisions.,2,How I Met Your Mother,100,17
10073,Lily,12, It's 2,2,How I Met Your Mother,7,2
10074,Robin,12, That's why I need your help.,2,How I Met Your Mother,29,6
10076,Ted,12," Robin convinced Katie to stay with her that first night. And the next day, I took everybody to the Empire State Building.",2,How I Met Your Mother,122,22
10077,Ted,12, You guys are lucky you came here with an architect. Empire State Building fun,2,How I Met Your Mother,78,14
10079,Robin,12," You know, Katie, I have wanted to come to the Empire State Building for so long, but I waited to come here with someone special.",2,How I Met Your Mother,129,25
10081,Lily,12, Marshall and I have never been to the Empire State Building either. But I'm so glad I waited to do something so important with my fiancee.,2,How I Met Your Mother,139,26
10082,Marshall,12," Speaking of waiting, I signed an abstinence pledge in high school. It's totally cool to wait. And stay away from drugs... other than pot.",2,How I Met Your Mother,138,24
10084,Robin,12," Oh, okay, yes, I told them. But only because I think you should hear it from other grownups, too. Everyone thinks you should wait. Right, guys?",2,How I Met Your Mother,144,26
10086,Barney,12, s*x is fun.,2,How I Met Your Mother,12,3
10087,Robin,12, See?,2,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
10089,Robin,12," Well, how do you know that? You left your diary in your old room slash my new room.",2,How I Met Your Mother,84,18
10090,Barney,12," I'll pay you $10,000 for that diary.",2,How I Met Your Mother,37,7
10092,Robin,12," Oh. La, la, la, la, la.La, la, la, la, la, la, la,la, la, la, la, la.",2,How I Met Your Mother,70,16
10093,Marshall,12, Even Kyle gets to do that.,2,How I Met Your Mother,27,6
10095,Robin,12," But Kyle? Why can't you just wait? Because if you wait, you can get a nice guy like Ted.",2,How I Met Your Mother,89,19
10097,Robin,12," You smoke now, too?",2,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
10098,Lily,12," Oh, remember cloves?",2,How I Met Your Mother,21,3
10099,Marshall,12, No!,2,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
10100,Robin,12," No ""Aw, remember cloves?"" This can't happen. She's my baby sister, okay? She should be watching The Little Mermaid and drinking Yoohoo, and not having s*x.",2,How I Met Your Mother,156,26
10101,Ted,12," Come on, you were only 16 when you had s*x. I was 17.",2,How I Met Your Mother,54,13
10102,Marshall,12, We were 18.,2,How I Met Your Mother,12,3
10103,Ted,12, Barney was probably 12.,2,How I Met Your Mother,24,4
10104,Barney,12," Good one, Ted. I was, uh, six... fourt... How old were you again?",2,How I Met Your Mother,66,13
10105,Ted,12,17,2,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
10106,Barney,12," Dude, me, too.",2,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
10107,Lily,12," Barney, you okay?",2,How I Met Your Mother,18,3
10108,Barney,12," Yeah, of course. What, you don't believe me? - It was at camp, so I'm...",2,How I Met Your Mother,73,15
10109,Marshall,12, What camp?,2,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
10110,Barney,12, This place in the Catskills. Look it up. I was there teaching for the summer.,2,How I Met Your Mother,78,15
10111,Robin,12, What did you teach?,2,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
10112,Barney,12," Uh, dance.",2,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
10113,Ted,12, Dance?,2,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
10114,Barney,12," Yeah, Ted, dance. Maybe you've heard of it. It was just a simple summer job, but it turned into so much more. Her name was Frances Houseman, but everyone called her Baby.",2,How I Met Your Mother,171,32
10116,Barney,12, Sylvia,2,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
10118,Barney,12, How you call your loverboy?,2,How I Met Your Mother,28,5
10120,Barney,12, And if he doesn't answer,2,How I Met Your Mother,25,5
10122,Barney,12, And if he still doesn't answer?,2,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
10125,Lily,12, That's Dirty Dancing.,2,How I Met Your Mother,22,3
10126,Ted,12, It was on last night.,2,How I Met Your Mother,22,5
10127,Marshall,12," No, it was two nights ago. ""She's Like the Wind"" has been stuck in my brain for about 40 hours. I just got it out. Now it's back in. Damn you, Swayze!",2,How I Met Your Mother,151,32
10128,Lily,12, Do you remember our first time?,2,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
10129,Marshall,12, Yeah. It was back in college.,2,How I Met Your Mother,30,6
10131,Lily,12," Oh, wait, wait. Look... I really want to do this, but... we should make it special, you know? Do this right.",2,How I Met Your Mother,109,21
10132,Marshall,12, Okay. You're right. Maybe we could go to the beach and get a house for the weekend.,2,How I Met Your Mother,84,17
10133,Lily,12," Yeah, New Year's Eve.",2,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
10134,Marshall,12, Okay.,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
10135,Lily,12," Oh, and we'll light candles and maybe put on some classical music.",2,How I Met Your Mother,67,12
10136,Marshall,12, That's not a good idea.,2,How I Met Your Mother,24,5
10137,Lily,12, Why not?,2,How I Met Your Mother,9,2
10138,Marshall,12, Long story. But maybe we could put on some Al Green and take a bubble bath together.,2,How I Met Your Mother,85,17
10139,Lily,12," Oh, yeah, that sounds so good. Oh, I love you, Marshall. I'm so glad we're waiting. ",2,How I Met Your Mother,85,16
10140,Robin,12," Oh, that's adorable.",2,How I Met Your Mother,21,3
10141,Ted,12," Yeah, tell her what happened next.",2,How I Met Your Mother,35,6
10143,Marshall,12, That was amazing.,2,How I Met Your Mother,18,3
10144,Lily,12, Yeah. Want to do it again?,2,How I Met Your Mother,27,6
10145,Ted,12, Please don't. End of flashback.,2,How I Met Your Mother,32,5
10146,Marshall,12, We said we were sorry.,2,How I Met Your Mother,23,5
10147,Ted,12," Yeah, well, then why'd you do it again?",2,How I Met Your Mother,40,8
10148,Marshall,12," You know what, I loaned you my Walkman.",2,How I Met Your Mother,40,8
10149,Lily,12," The point is no matter what, it's never gonna be as perfect as you want it to be.",2,How I Met Your Mother,82,18
10150,Robin,12," Well, mine was terrible.",2,How I Met Your Mother,25,4
10151,Lily,12," Wait, I've never heard your story.",2,How I Met Your Mother,35,6
10152,Robin,12," Well, as you know, I was 16. And it was with my boyfriend Brian.",2,How I Met Your Mother,65,14
10155,Robin,12, Yeah.,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
10157,Robin,12," Oh, I know.",2,How I Met Your Mother,12,3
10159,Robin,12," Oh, Brian.",2,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
10161,Lily,12, I'm so sorry.,2,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
10162,Robin,12," Eh, I should've known. There were signs.",2,How I Met Your Mother,41,7
10165,Robin,12," What?! Oh, my God!",2,How I Met Your Mother,19,4
10167,Robin,12," You only get one shot at losing your virginity. And even though I just barely had s*x, it counts.",2,How I Met Your Mother,98,19
10168,Lily,12, What do you mean just barely?,2,How I Met Your Mother,30,6
10169,Robin,12," Well, he didn't dive all the way into the pool, but he... splashed around in the shallow end.",2,How I Met Your Mother,94,18
10170,Lily,12,  Then you didn't lose your virginity to him. Just barely doesn't count.,2,How I Met Your Mother,72,12
10171,Robin,12," Yes, it does.",2,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
10172,Lily,12," No, it doesn't.",2,How I Met Your Mother,16,3
10173,Marshall,12," Yes, it does.",2,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
10174,Lily,12," No, it doesn't. It doesn't count. End of story.",2,How I Met Your Mother,48,9
10175,Barney,12," Ooh, why, Lily Aldrin, you saucy little harlot. Could it be that before Marshall took a swim, someone else tested the water?",2,How I Met Your Mother,125,22
10176,Marshall,12," No. Nobody else tested the water, right? Scooter?",2,How I Met Your Mother,50,8
10177,Barney,12, Who's Scooter?,2,How I Met Your Mother,15,2
10178,Lily,12," My high school boyfriend, who I did not have s*x with.",2,How I Met Your Mother,55,11
10179,Marshall,12," I... I can't believe this. We're Marshall and Lily, when people see us, they say, ""Oh, look at them, they've only had s*x with each other.""",2,How I Met Your Mother,140,26
10180,Barney,12," No, Marshall, they say,  ""Oh, look at them, they've only had s*x with each other.""",2,How I Met Your Mother,83,15
10181,Marshall,12," But now that's not true anymore, now you've had s*x with twice as many people as I have. I knew that you were too good at it.",2,How I Met Your Mother,126,27
10183,Ted,12, It's not stupid.,2,How I Met Your Mother,17,3
10185,Robin,12," Katie, please. You only get to lose your virginity once. You should only be having s*x with someone who's special.",2,How I Met Your Mother,115,20
10187,Robin,12, It's not a hundred guys. It's not a hundred guys.,2,How I Met Your Mother,50,10
10189,Robin,12, I had different levels of feeling for each of the... very reasonable number of guys.,2,How I Met Your Mother,85,15
10191,Robin,12," I, um...",2,How I Met Your Mother,9,2
10192,Ted,12," Okay, Empire State Building fun fact number 22",2,How I Met Your Mother,47,8
10193,Robin,12, Just let me explain.,2,How I Met Your Mother,21,4
10194,Ted,12, You don't have to explain anything. You don't have to say it-- it's fine.,2,How I Met Your Mother,74,14
10195,Robin,12," Okay, but if relationships are like a freeway, then saying... ""hm hm hm"" is like... getting into the carpool lane. And I don't want to take an exit, but... at the same time, I'm not ready to get into the carpool lane. Because what's in the carpool lane? Oh, it's a big diamond, and I'm just not ready to get...",2,How I Met Your Mother,311,60
10196,Ted,12," Okay, Robin, Robin, stop. It's no big deal, you don't have to say it.",2,How I Met Your Mother,70,14
10197,Robin,12," It's just, it's a big thing to say to someone, and I don't want to say it too soon.",2,How I Met Your Mother,84,19
10198,Ted,12," What, you mean like I did?",2,How I Met Your Mother,27,6
10199,Robin,12," No. I didn't... Yeah, like you did. I mean, you have to admit it, Ted, it was a little weird.",2,How I Met Your Mother,94,20
10200,Ted,12, Weird... or courageous?,2,How I Met Your Mother,24,3
10201,Robin,12," Pretty sure weird. I mean, who gives it up on the first date?",2,How I Met Your Mother,62,13
10202,Ted,12," Well, come on, it shows I'm brave and bold, like a knight.",2,How I Met Your Mother,59,12
10203,Robin,12," No, it shows that you're an I-love-you slut.",2,How I Met Your Mother,45,8
10204,Ted,12," Well, then you're an I-love-you prude. You know what? I take mine back.",2,How I Met Your Mother,72,13
10205,Robin,12, You... What?,2,How I Met Your Mother,13,2
10206,Ted,12," I take my ""I love you"" back.",2,How I Met Your Mother,29,7
10207,Robin,12, You can't take it back.,2,How I Met Your Mother,24,5
10208,Ted,12," Nah. Just did. Got it right here. But, you know, I'm such a slut. I'm just gonna give it away. Hey, you, sir. I love you.",2,How I Met Your Mother,122,26
10210,Lily,12," Marshall, why is this such a big deal?",2,How I Met Your Mother,39,8
10211,Marshall,12," Why is this such a big deal? Oh, uh, sorry, Christopher Columbus, guess who actually discovered the New World. Some dude named Scooter. Oh, uh, Neil Armstrong, it actually goes like this",2,How I Met Your Mother,187,32
10212,Lily,12," Okay, Marshall, I get it.",2,How I Met Your Mother,26,5
10213,Marshall,12, It's a big deal because it rewrites our history.,2,How I Met Your Mother,49,9
10214,Lily,12," No, it doesn't. Look, have you been to the Empire State Building? No. You've only been in the lobby. People don't buy tickets to get in the lobby. They buy tickets to get to the top. Scooter only got in the lobby, and the lobby doesn't count.",2,How I Met Your Mother,243,47
10215,Marshall,12," Really. Excuse me, sir, uh, can you tell me how to get to the Empire State Building?",2,How I Met Your Mother,85,17
10217,Marshall,12," Thank you, sir. You're a very wise and brilliant man.",2,How I Met Your Mother,54,10
10219,Robin,12," Katie, I'll admit, maybe I'm not in any place to lecture you on romantic relationships, but... but I just don't want you to make the same mistakes that I've made.",2,How I Met Your Mother,163,30
10221,Robin,12, That's not what I meant. I just wish you weren't in such a rush to grow up. Please don't do this.,2,How I Met Your Mother,98,21
10225,Ted,12," All right, here's what really happened.",2,How I Met Your Mother,40,6
10228,Robin,12, Hey.,2,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
10229,Ted,12, Hey.,2,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
10230,Robin,12, She didn't do it.,2,How I Met Your Mother,18,4
10231,Ted,12," Hey, that's great! You got through to her.",2,How I Met Your Mother,43,8
10232,Robin,12," No, I didn't. You did. She told me that you talked to her.",2,How I Met Your Mother,59,13
10234,Ted,12," Hey, Katie.",2,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
10236,Ted,12," No. I wouldn't bore you with the seven million man-hours it took to build this 102-story testament to human will. So, you okay?",2,How I Met Your Mother,128,23
10238,Ted,12," That's very gallant. Well, I don't know what your sister's freaking out about, either. - I was your age my first time.",2,How I Met Your Mother,119,22
10240,Ted,12," Yeah, yeah. It was, uh, it was with this girl, Molly.",2,How I Met Your Mother,54,11
10243,Ted,12," Oh, I love you, too, Molly.  But I didn't.",2,How I Met Your Mother,43,9
10245,Ted,12," Look, I got to go.",2,How I Met Your Mother,19,5
10247,Ted,12, My cousin got some firecrackers from Mexico. We're going out to the woods to light 'em-- it's gonna be awesome.,2,How I Met Your Mother,112,20
10249,Ted,12," Yeah. Yeah, I'll totally call you.  But I didn't. Molly?",2,How I Met Your Mother,57,10
10251,Ted,12, Can I borrow 20 bucks? I'll totally pay you back. But I didn't.,2,How I Met Your Mother,64,13
10253,Ted,12," And I never saw her again. I told her I loved her, but... I just wanted to have s*x. I-I would've said anything to make that happen, and... that's exactly what I did. Look, I'm not telling you what to do. I'm just telling you what all 17-year-old boys are like. Even the nice ones.",2,How I Met Your Mother,282,55
10256,Robin,12," Oh, oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry. Aw, honey. I promise everything is gonna be okay. You want to watch The Little Mermaid and drink some YooHoo?",2,How I Met Your Mother,141,26
10258,Robin,12, Don't tell Mom.,2,How I Met Your Mother,16,3
10260,Robin,12, Thanks for doing that.,2,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
10261,Ted,12, You're welcome. I knew it meant a lot to you.,2,How I Met Your Mother,46,10
10262,Robin,12," But, man, your story, I mean, it doesn't even sound like you.",2,How I Met Your Mother,62,12
10263,Ted,12," Yeah, well...",2,How I Met Your Mother,14,2
10265,Ted,12," I love you, Molly.",2,How I Met Your Mother,19,4
10267,Ted,12, Wow. That was amazing.,2,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
10269,Ted,12, Wh-Where are you going?,2,How I Met Your Mother,24,4
10271,Ted,12, Will you call me?,2,How I Met Your Mother,18,4
10273,Ted,12, Yeah?,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
10276,Ted,12, But she didn't.,2,How I Met Your Mother,16,3
10277,Robin,12," Oh, come here. I love you. I said it. Feels right. I love you.",2,How I Met Your Mother,63,14
10278,Ted,12," I'm gay. I'm kidding. I love you, too. Hey... you lost your I-love-you-ginity.",2,How I Met Your Mother,79,13
10279,Robin,12, Yeah. I guess I was just waiting for the right guy.,2,How I Met Your Mother,52,11
10280,Ted,12, Katie ended up having a great first time in New York. And the last thing we did before she left was go to the Empire State Building.,2,How I Met Your Mother,133,27
10281,Ted,12, I am so glad we're finally doing this.,2,How I Met Your Mother,39,8
10282,Barney,12, What are you talking about? We were here yesterday.,2,How I Met Your Mother,52,9
10283,Marshall,12," Yeah, but that didn't really count. Oh, crap.",2,How I Met Your Mother,46,8
10284,Lily,12," Exactly! So yesterday doesn't count as having gone to the Empire State Building. So I lost it to you, Marshall. And I rode that elevator to the top, and I saw that view, and I basked in the awesomeness. And that's our story.",2,How I Met Your Mother,225,43
10285,Marshall,12," Yeah. Yeah, that's our story. We've only had s*x with each other.",2,How I Met Your Mother,66,12
10286,Lily,12, We've only had s*x with each other.,2,How I Met Your Mother,36,7
10287,Barney,12, They've only had s*x with each other.,2,How I Met Your Mother,38,7
10288,Ted,12," Ooh, okay, in, in we go, in we go. Okay, Empire State Building fun fact number 81",2,How I Met Your Mother,82,17
10290,Ted,12," So, now you guys can finally say you've been to the Empire State Building. How have you lived here so long and never been to the top?",2,How I Met Your Mother,134,27
10291,Marshall,12," Well, we're usually busy... drinking.",2,How I Met Your Mother,38,5
10292,Lily,12," Speaking of first times, we never got to hear your virginity story.",2,How I Met Your Mother,68,12
10293,Marshall,12," That's right, I almost forgot.",2,How I Met Your Mother,31,5
10294,Barney,12," Okay. I was 16, and it was in a baseball dugout...",2,How I Met Your Mother,51,11

10299,Ted,12," That's War Games, and there's not even a s*x scene in it.",2,How I Met Your Mother,58,12
10300,Barney,12," All right! I was 23, and it was with my mom's 45-year-old divorced friend, Rhonda. She called me ""Barry"" the whole time, and for two weeks, my comforter smelled like menthol cigarettes. You happy?",2,How I Met Your Mother,197,34
10301,Marshall,12, Hey... Why don't you tell us again about your first time at the camp in the Catskills.,2,How I Met Your Mother,87,17
10302,Barney,12, Baby and her family spent every summer at Kellerman's. Her dad did not approve of our love.,2,How I Met Your Mother,92,17
10303,Ted,12, Did anyone put Baby in a corner?,2,How I Met Your Mother,33,7
10305,Ted,13," Some kids dream of being astronauts. Some kids dream of playing baseball. When I was a kid, I had only one dream. To build a skyscraper.",2,How I Met Your Mother,137,26
10308,Ted,13, There were some obstacles along the way. But eventually my dream came true. I became an architect.,2,How I Met Your Mother,99,17
10310,Ted,13," Morning, everyone! So, I had an idea for the atrium. Ready? Columns.",2,How I Met Your Mother,69,12
10313,Ted,13, I... I can't believe you knocked over my model.,2,How I Met Your Mother,48,9
10315,Ted,13, I know what you're thinking,2,How I Met Your Mother,28,5
10317,Ted,13," And to be honest, I wasn't sure I liked it either. See, before, when I was just another employee, I was happy, carefree. The guy who hung out in the break room making fun of the boss.",2,How I Met Your Mother,184,37
10319,Ted,13, Did you see what he was wearing today? It was like his pants were being held up by his nipples.,2,How I Met Your Mother,96,20
10321,Ted,13, But suddenly I was a different guy.,2,How I Met Your Mother,36,7
10323,Ted,13," Hey, guys. What's so funny?",2,How I Met Your Mother,28,5
10325,Ted,13, Thanks.,2,How I Met Your Mother,8,1

10330,Ted,13," Before, I used to be this guy.",2,How I Met Your Mother,31,7
10331,Ted,13," Dude, of course you should take the day off for the Foo Fighters concert. Just say you're sick.",2,How I Met Your Mother,96,18
10332,Ted,13, But now...I was this guy.,2,How I Met Your Mother,26,5
10333,Ted,13," Sick, huh? Unbutton your shirt. Hmm... ""Foo Fighters."" Get back to work.",2,How I Met Your Mother,73,12

10339,Robin,13," Oh, wow, he must be really good-looking.",2,How I Met Your Mother,41,7
10340,Ted,13, Why would you say that?,2,How I Met Your Mother,24,5
10341,Robin,13," Well, 'cause only good-looking people can get away with saying things like that.",2,How I Met Your Mother,81,13
10342,Barney,13, I have found that to be true.,2,How I Met Your Mother,30,7
10343,Marshall,13, It's a blessing and a curse really.,2,How I Met Your Mother,36,7
10344,Lily,13," Ted, you can't let him treat you like that.",2,How I Met Your Mother,44,9
10345,Marshall,13," Yeah, you gotta ask yourself, who's the boss?",2,How I Met Your Mother,46,8
10346,Ted,13, Tony.,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
10347,Robin,13, Angela.,2,How I Met Your Mother,8,1
10348,Barney,13, Mona.,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
10349,Robin,13, Mona?,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
10350,Barney,13, Watch it more closely. Rock your world.,2,How I Met Your Mother,40,7
10351,Robin,13," So, what are you gonna do?",2,How I Met Your Mother,27,6
10352,Ted,13," Well... it's awkward, I mean, the guy used to be my boss. So, I went to talk to the managing partner.",2,How I Met Your Mother,102,21
10355,Ted,13," Well, sir, I was thinking he could just be put on a different project.",2,How I Met Your Mother,71,14

10361,Ted,13, Knock yourself out.,2,How I Met Your Mother,20,3
10362,Robin,13," Well, Ted, if you do fire Druthers, the key is timing. Remember when I had to fire my makeup artist?",2,How I Met Your Mother,101,20
10364,Robin,13," Vicki, um... I'm so sorry about this, but there's been some budget cuts and, um, we have to let you go. I mean, after tonight. I still need my makeup for the broadcast. So... ",2,How I Met Your Mother,176,34
10366,Ted,13, You know what? I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna fire Druthers tomorrow.,2,How I Met Your Mother,66,12
10367,Barney,13," Oh, my God! ",2,How I Met Your Mother,13,3
10368,Ted,13, What?,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
10369,Barney,13, Do you know about this?,2,How I Met Your Mother,24,5
10370,Ted,13, No.,2,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
10371,Robin,13, What is that?,2,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
10372,Barney,13," Only the greatest thing ever. Wait, wait, wait-- that's not enough buildup. If they were to cure cancer tomorrow, this would still be the greatest thing to happen all week. Okay. Now you're ready for naked Marshall.",2,How I Met Your Mother,216,37
10373,Ted,13," Oh, my God. This is awesome times awesome. It's awesome squared.",2,How I Met Your Mother,65,11
10374,Barney,13," I know, right? Behind the piano this whole time.",2,How I Met Your Mother,49,9
10375,Robin,13," Wait. If Marshall went to all this trouble to hide it, he clearly doesn't want us to find it.",2,How I Met Your Mother,94,19
10376,Barney,13," Oh, come on, Robin.",2,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
10377,Robin,13," No, I'm saying that he must be really embarrassed by this. We are gonna have so much fun.",2,How I Met Your Mother,90,18
10378,Barney,13, I know! We're gonna have so much fun!,2,How I Met Your Mother,38,8
10381,Ted,13," Uh, yeah, like four hours ago.",2,How I Met Your Mother,31,6
10383,Ted,13," This is a cocktail napkin. Covered in profanity. Look, Hammond, um, there's no easy way to say this, so... why don't we just, um, step into your office.",2,How I Met Your Mother,153,28
10388,Robin,13," So, you didn't fire him?",2,How I Met Your Mother,25,5
10389,Ted,13," I can't fire a guy on his birthday. Everyone would hate me. Besides, they put a party hat on me. My authority was compromised.",2,How I Met Your Mother,127,24
10390,Barney,13," Oh, hey, Marshall. Have a seat. I know how much you love stools.",2,How I Met Your Mother,65,13

10403,Marshall,13, How did you know that?,2,How I Met Your Mother,23,5
10404,Lily,13, Because I didn't hide it very well.,2,How I Met Your Mother,36,7
10406,Ted,13," So the story on the painting is that,back in college, Lily wanted to do a nude study for her art class. Marshall wasn't so into the idea.",2,How I Met Your Mother,138,27
10407,Marshall,13," Well, I just... don't think that some dude should drop trou just to pose for you.",2,How I Met Your Mother,82,16
10408,Lily,13," It's for class, and it's just that weird kid Hunter from my freshman hall.",2,How I Met Your Mother,75,14
10409,Marshall,13, The frisbee dude with the soul patch? He's like the hottest guy in school!,2,How I Met Your Mother,75,14
10410,Lily,13," No, he's actually a little husky...",2,How I Met Your Mother,36,6
10411,Marshall,13," Oh, he's just huggable! And complicated... and a little bit of a jerk. Just enough so you think maybe you can change him.",2,How I Met Your Mother,122,23
10412,Lily,13," Okay, just forget it.",2,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
10413,Marshall,13," Call me old-fashioned, I just think that I'm the only guy you should see naked.",2,How I Met Your Mother,80,15
10414,Lily,13," Well, then you'll have to do it.",2,How I Met Your Mother,33,7
10415,Marshall,13, Are you kidding me? What if somebody sees it?,2,How I Met Your Mother,46,9
10416,Lily,13, We're not in high school anymore. People don't make fun of you for posing nude for a painting. We're adults now.,2,How I Met Your Mother,113,21
10418,Barney,13, We totally saw your butt.,2,How I Met Your Mother,26,5
10419,Marshall,13, This painting has caused too much grief already. I'm destroying it right now.,2,How I Met Your Mother,78,13
10420,Barney,13," Oh, no, what's the matter, Marshall?",2,How I Met Your Mother,37,6
10421,Marshall,13, Where is it?,2,How I Met Your Mother,13,3
10422,Barney,13, I'll tell you where it is if you'll answer these riddles three.,2,How I Met Your Mother,64,12
10423,Marshall,13," You hung it up in the bar, didn't you?",2,How I Met Your Mother,39,9
10424,Barney,13," Yo, why you gotta ruin my riddles?",2,How I Met Your Mother,35,7
10425,Ted,13, Field trip!,2,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
10427,Barney,13," Oh, no. Someone put your painting up behind the bar. Classic! What a memorable prank.",2,How I Met Your Mother,86,15
10429,Marshall,13," What'll I have? Um, I don't know, maybe a beer and that nude painting of me hanging behind the bar!",2,How I Met Your Mother,100,20
10431,Marshall,13, I know that Barney gave you that painting.,2,How I Met Your Mother,43,8
10433,Marshall,13," Whatever he's paying you, I'll pay you double.",2,How I Met Your Mother,47,8
10435,Marshall,13," Whatever he's paying you, I'll give you that plus ten bucks.",2,How I Met Your Mother,61,11
10437,Marshall,13," All right, you know what, Carl, you just lost yourself a regular customer.",2,How I Met Your Mother,75,13
10439,Marshall,13, This painting is the worst thing that's ever happened to me.,2,How I Met Your Mother,61,11
10440,Robin,13," Okay, where should we put it up next? In his law school? Ooh on the side of a bus. Oh, oh! How much do billboards cost?",2,How I Met Your Mother,120,26
10441,Barney,13," Easy, Scherbatsky. Finesse. I've got a five-year rollout plan. I'll have you know that painting's got commitments all over the city. Then, after New York...",2,How I Met Your Mother,157,25
10443,Ted,13," One of my worst fears has come true-- I just saw Marshall grabbing himself naked. Well, I gotta go. Believe it or not, I have to go back to the office.",2,How I Met Your Mother,152,31
10444,Robin,13," Oh, I'll go out with you. Bye, guys.",2,How I Met Your Mother,37,8
10446,Lily,13," You know, I wish everyone didn't have to make fun of that painting.",2,How I Met Your Mother,68,13
10447,Barney,13," Eh, we're not making fun of the painting, we're just making fun of Marshall. The painting's actually really great.",2,How I Met Your Mother,115,19
10448,Lily,13, Are you serious?,2,How I Met Your Mother,17,3
10449,Barney,13, Yeah.,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
10450,Lily,13," Well, thank you. You know, seeing it again makes me miss painting nudes. What?",2,How I Met Your Mother,79,14
10451,Barney,13, Paint me.,2,How I Met Your Mother,10,2
10452,Lily,13, What?,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
10453,Barney,13, Paint me.,2,How I Met Your Mother,10,2
10456,Ted,13," Hammond, is that you?",2,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
10458,Ted,13," Druthers and I were alone in the office. If I was gonna fire him, this would be the best chance I'd ever have.",2,How I Met Your Mother,111,23
10460,Ted,13," Uh, no, I, I really need to talk to you. Look, there's no easy way to say... What, what are you doing?",2,How I Met Your Mother,103,22
10462,Ted,13, I'm standing here wearing pants. Are you sleeping here? What's going on?,2,How I Met Your Mother,73,12
10464,Ted,13," Okay, well, uh, you're right-- that is none of my business. Uh, look, there's no easy way to say this-- I...",2,How I Met Your Mother,109,21
10466,Ted,13, It's okay.,2,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
10468,Ted,13," Happy birthday, buddy. So, you've been living at the office?",2,How I Met Your Mother,61,10
10470,Ted,13," Yeah, I do.",2,How I Met Your Mother,12,3
10472,Ted,13, I see it.,2,How I Met Your Mother,10,3
10474,Ted,13," Not lost on me at all. But I don't understand, why don't you just go to a hotel? You could be sleeping on a mattress instead of... what appears to be torn-up drawings of my building.",2,How I Met Your Mother,183,36
10476,Ted,13," Uh, no, I don't.",2,How I Met Your Mother,17,4
10478,Ted,13," Well, that's the dream.",2,How I Met Your Mother,24,4
10480,Ted,13," Me too, Hammond.",2,How I Met Your Mother,17,3
10482,Ted,13," No, thanks.",2,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
10484,Ted,13," No, I think just Hammond.",2,How I Met Your Mother,26,5
10487,Robin,13," So, I'm guessing you didn't fire him.",2,How I Met Your Mother,38,7
10488,Ted,13, I was this close.,2,How I Met Your Mother,18,4
10489,Ted,13," Meanwhile, Lily had been up all night in the grips of a dilemma.",2,How I Met Your Mother,65,13
10491,Lily,13," Oh honey, you're awake?",2,How I Met Your Mother,24,4
10492,Marshall,13, I'm awake. Is everything okay?,2,How I Met Your Mother,31,5
10493,Lily,13, Yeah. I've kind of been wrestling with something. What if I told you I had a way to pay for our honeymoon?,2,How I Met Your Mother,107,22
10494,Marshall,13," Baby, our honeymoon's already paid for. We're going to Howe Caverns.",2,How I Met Your Mother,69,11
10495,Lily,13," Well yeah, but-- but what if we didn't want to spend our honeymoon in a cave?",2,How I Met Your Mother,78,16
10496,Marshall,13," It's not just a cave, it's a whole labyrinth of caves. It's an underground adventure. There's a cave that's so dark that you don't even know you're in there. I mean, we're going to experience a whole new kind of dark.",2,How I Met Your Mother,218,41
10497,Lily,13," Well, what if I found a way to make a little extra money so that we spend our honeymoon not in Howe Caverns, but in Scotland?",2,How I Met Your Mother,126,26
10498,Marshall,13, Loch Ness?,2,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
10499,Lily,13," Yeah. And you know, Edinburgh and the Highlands and Glasgow...",2,How I Met Your Mother,63,10
10500,Marshall,13," Loch Ness. Nessy. Baby, I would love to search for the enchanted creature of the Emerald Loch, but... we can't afford that.",2,How I Met Your Mother,124,22
10501,Lily,13, Maybe we can.,2,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
10503,Barney,13, Paint me.,2,How I Met Your Mother,10,2
10504,Lily,13," Okay, I don't get this. You've been making fun of that painting all this time and now you want me to paint you?",2,How I Met Your Mother,112,23
10505,Barney,13," We knew we could torture Marshall because he has shame. I do not. In my body, where the shame gland should be, there's a second awesome gland. True story.",2,How I Met Your Mother,155,29
10506,Lily,13," Yeah, that's not the gland I'm worried about painting.",2,How I Met Your Mother,55,9
10507,Barney,13," Yeah. A nude Barney is a challenge. But I think you're talented enough to immortalize this. Now is the time-- I'm 31. I'm at the peak of my physical beauty. If I were a woman, I'd have passed it long, long ago. Long ago.",2,How I Met Your Mother,221,44
10508,Lily,13, Forget it. I promised Marshall he was the only guy I would ever see naked.,2,How I Met Your Mother,75,15
10509,Barney,13," I'll give you $5,000.",2,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
10511,Marshall,13, We're going to Loch Ness!,2,How I Met Your Mother,26,5
10512,Lily,13, Yeah!,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
10514,Ted,13, That cabby would not shut up.,2,How I Met Your Mother,30,6
10516,Ted,13," I think it, you say it.",2,How I Met Your Mother,24,6
10518,Ted,13," Morning, team. So, I have given it some thought, and I say we revisit columns.",2,How I Met Your Mother,79,15
10520,Ted,13, What?,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
10522,Ted,13, Can I see you for one second?,2,How I Met Your Mother,30,7
10524,Ted,13," What are you doing? I thought we were friends. You slept on my couch, you ate my cereal. I tossed you more toilet paper.",2,How I Met Your Mother,121,24
10526,Ted,13," What? I don't believe this! You're, you're, you're wearing my clothes! And my",2,How I Met Your Mother,78,13
10530,Lily,13," Okay, let's get this over with.",2,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
10531,Barney,13," Hey, hey! I don't want you phoning this in. This painting could, someday, become a serious work of art. I mean, you have been blessed with an amazing gift.",2,How I Met Your Mother,156,29
10532,Lily,13, Thank you.,2,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
10533,Barney,13," I meant me. Now, I like how you captured Marshall's essence. Goofy and unburdened, with wit. But me, I want something more regal. Something my progeny could look at and say, ""There's stands Barnabus Stinson."" He was wise... and strong.",2,How I Met Your Mother,236,40
10534,Lily,13, I don't think your sword will fit.,2,How I Met Your Mother,35,7
10535,Barney,13, I get that a lot.,2,How I Met Your Mother,18,5
10536,Ted,13," And so, as Lily began painting, Marshall thought about the $5,000 and what his fiancee was doing to earn it.",2,How I Met Your Mother,109,20
10538,Marshall,13, This isn't right. This isn't right at all.,2,How I Met Your Mother,43,8
10539,Ted,13," Finally, he could take it no more.",2,How I Met Your Mother,35,7
10541,Lily,13, Hold still. Hold still. Hold still!,2,How I Met Your Mother,36,6
10542,Barney,13, Paint faster!,2,How I Met Your Mother,14,2
10543,Lily,13," Okay, I guess it's time. Drop your shorts.",2,How I Met Your Mother,43,8
10544,Barney,13," Yeah. Wait, wait! That wasn't enough buildup. I need... In a world without justice, one man...",2,How I Met Your Mother,95,16
10545,Lily,13," Oh, just drop them!",2,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
10546,Barney,13, All right.,2,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
10548,Marshall,13," No! No, this is not right!",2,How I Met Your Mother,27,6
10549,Barney,13, We had a deal!,2,How I Met Your Mother,15,4
10550,Marshall,13," Well, I'm going back on the deal. Barney, get out!",2,How I Met Your Mother,51,10
10551,Barney,13, You...!,2,How I Met Your Mother,8,1
10552,Marshall,13," It's over! .  Lily, I can't let you go through with this!  I found a castle we can stay in, but it's an extra two grand.  It's just not right! . It's beautiful and they say it's haunted.",2,How I Met Your Mother,187,38
10555,Barney,13," Before you say anything, I'll give you an extra five grand.",2,How I Met Your Mother,60,11
10556,Marshall,13,  We accept.,2,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
10557,Barney,13," You people are so easy to control. Dance for me, puppets, dance.",2,How I Met Your Mother,65,12
10558,Ted,13, And that's how Uncle Barney paid for Lily and Marshall's honeymoon.,2,How I Met Your Mother,68,11
10561,Ted,13," No. Look, Hammond, there's no easy way to say this but...",2,How I Met Your Mother,58,11
10565,Ted,13," Oh, God.",2,How I Met Your Mother,9,2
10567,Ted,13," There is no easy way to say this, but...",2,How I Met Your Mother,41,9
10569,Ted,13," Believe me, there is no easy way to say this...",2,How I Met Your Mother,48,10
10571,Ted,13, You've got to be kidding me!,2,How I Met Your Mother,29,6
10573,Ted,13," Wait, his birthday was yesterday!",2,How I Met Your Mother,34,5
10575,Ted,13," No! No birthday! No! I got something to say and I'm gonna get it out. Hammond, listen to me. I am sorry that your dog died, and that your wife is divorcing you and that... your life is falling apart and that these guys missed your birthday. And there is no easy way to say... What are you doing? What's going on?",2,How I Met Your Mother,313,62
10577,Ted,13," Oh, come on, you're not going to pull that, are you? Oh! Look, yeah, right. Now we're falling onto the ground. Well, nice try, but guess what? You're fired! You're fired, you get it? You hear me? You're gone! You're fired!  In my defense, I think we all suspected Hammond might have been faking. On the plus side, the EMTs seem to think he's going to be just fine and, as you saw, they did admit that I did not cause the heart attack, even if they said it a bit begrudgingly.",2,How I Met Your Mother,476,92
10578,Ted,13," And there it was, rock bottom",2,How I Met Your Mother,30,6
10581,Lily,13," Okay, it's done. I'm gonna step out, so you can admire it.",2,How I Met Your Mother,59,12
10582,Barney,13," Thank you very much, Lily.",2,How I Met Your Mother,27,5
10584,Lily,13," Marshall, do you have the money?",2,How I Met Your Mother,33,6

10586,Lily,13, Let's get out of here!,2,How I Met Your Mother,23,5
10587,Ted,14," Kids, I told you stories about all the big holidays - Christmas... Halloween... Thanksgiving... but one holiday was always my favorite-- Super Bowl Sunday. And there was one Super Bowl back in 2007 that I will never forget.",2,How I Met Your Mother,224,38
10589,Ted,14," Marshall, you're on beer detail. Lily, you're making the bean dip. Uh, Robin, you're on chips and pretzels, and Barney, I'm giving you nothing to do so you can just focus on controlling your gambling problem.",2,How I Met Your Mother,209,36
10590,Barney,14," ""Problem."" Oh, poor Superman, he should really do something about his flying problem. It's not a problem if you're awesome at it.",2,How I Met Your Mother,130,22

10602,Barney,14, Not a clue.,2,How I Met Your Mother,12,3
10603,Lily,14," Well, I guess we should go, right?",2,How I Met Your Mother,35,7

10614,Marshall,14," Okay, that's great, but just to make sure it records, maybe we should bow our heads and say a quiet prayer to the TiVo gods.",2,How I Met Your Mother,125,25
10615,Ted,14," Almighty TiVo, we thank you for all the gifts you have given us",2,How I Met Your Mother,64,13

10622,Robin,14," Oh, my God. This monkey was so cute.",2,How I Met Your Mother,37,8

10626,Barney,14," Have I taught you nothing, Ted?",2,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
10627,Ted,14, Virtually.,2,How I Met Your Mother,11,1

10630,Barney,14," ""Of or pertaining to tailors or their trade."" Suits are for the living. That's why when it's my time to R.I.P. I'm going out of this world the same way I came into it buck naked.

10663,Marshall,14, I can't believe you invited this girl we've only known for a few months to our sacred day. Now she's gonna be in all the pictures.,2,How I Met Your Mother,131,26
10664,Barney,14," Yeah, yeah, whatever. I'll give you the Seahawks plus six points for 500 bucks.",2,How I Met Your Mother,80,14
10665,Marshall,14, Are you crazy? Maybe for $50.,2,How I Met Your Mother,30,6
10666,Barney,14," $50?! What fun is $50?! Why don't we just bet air?! God, Marshall! Okay, $50.",2,How I Met Your Mother,78,15
10667,Robin,14," Hey, I'll take that action. Seahawks, but make it four points and make it a grand. Hey, these wings, are they chicken wings or angel wings? Oh, commercials! Monkey with a coconut bra. Hilarious.",2,How I Met Your Mother,195,34
10669,Ted,14," Look, we always watch the Super Bowl together. So we make a pact to watch it tomorrow at 6",2,How I Met Your Mother,91,19
10670,Barney,14, That's impossible.,2,How I Met Your Mother,19,2
10671,Ted,14," I'm not gonna lie to you. It's not gonna be easy. That means no TV, no Internet, no newspapers, nothing. Media blackout. But our tradition lives on. Who's in?",2,How I Met Your Mother,159,29
10672,Lily,14, I'm in.,2,How I Met Your Mother,8,2
10673,Robin,14, I'm in.,2,How I Met Your Mother,8,2
10674,Marshall,14, I'm in.,2,How I Met Your Mother,8,2
10675,Barney,14," What the hell, I'm in. High five!",2,How I Met Your Mother,34,7
10676,Ted,14," Dude, we're at a wake.",2,How I Met Your Mother,23,5
10677,Barney,14, Sorry. Solemn low five.,2,How I Met Your Mother,24,4
10679,Ted,14," As the day began, none of us had any idea how hard it would be to go nine hours without hearing the outcome of the Super Bowl. I decided to work from home to avoid contamination by the outside world.",2,How I Met Your Mother,200,40
10681,Barney,14," Hey, take this key and swallow it.",2,How I Met Your Mother,35,7
10682,Ted,14, What? No.,2,How I Met Your Mother,10,2
10683,Barney,14," Come on, Ted, you eat salads. It'll be out by game time.",2,How I Met Your Mother,57,12
10684,Ted,14," Lots more, no.",2,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
10685,Barney,14," I'm not messing around, Theodore. I've got a lot of money riding on this game. If I don't handcuff myself to this radiator, I'll check the score. Please take the key.",2,How I Met Your Mother,167,31
10686,Ted,14, Fine. But only because you didn't think through a bathroom plan and I think that's funny.,2,How I Met Your Mother,90,16
10688,Ted,14," The media blackout was particularly hard on Robin because, well, she was the media.",2,How I Met Your Mother,84,14
10689,Robin,14," But unfortunately, the City won't be fixing the unusually large pothole any time soon, so buckle up if you're on the BQE. It's gonna be a bumpy one.",2,How I Met Your Mother,149,28
10693,Robin,14, No!,2,How I Met Your Mother,4,1

10697,Robin,14," No, it's not. It's time for Weather.",2,How I Met Your Mother,37,7
10699,Robin,14," Well, weather's pretty fickle, it may have changed. What's it doing out there, Lou?",2,How I Met Your Mother,84,14
10702,Robin,14, No! Let's go to Traffic Todd in the Metro News 1 Gridlock Chopper.,2,How I Met Your Mother,67,13
10706,Ted,14," Weeks earlier, Marshall had promised Lily he'd come into her kindergarten class for show-and-tell day.",2,How I Met Your Mother,103,15
10707,Lily,14, And he's a little bit double-jointed... And his favorite animal is the Loch Ness monster.,2,How I Met Your Mother,90,15
10708,Marshall,14," Lily, how many times...? Nessie is a gentle creature. We're trying to stay away from terms like ""Monster.""",2,How I Met Your Mother,107,18
10709,Lily,14," Well, I think we can all agree, he is much more interesting than Sally's one-eyed goldfish. Three weeks in a row? Come on, Sally. Okay, well, that's all the time we have. Arts and crafts, everybody.",2,How I Met Your Mother,199,36
10711,Marshall,14," Oh, hey, I'm Marshall.",2,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
10713,Marshall,14," Yeah, I'm actually trying to hide out 'cause I don't want to know who won the Super Bowl.",2,How I Met Your Mother,90,18
10715,Marshall,14," Oh, um, that's great, but I really don't want to know, so if you could just keep that to yourself.",2,How I Met Your Mother,99,20
10717,Marshall,14, Excuse me?,2,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
10719,Marshall,14, Are you serious?,2,How I Met Your Mother,17,3
10723,Barney,14," Unlock me, Ted. I've never gone this long without calling my bookie. He worries.",2,How I Met Your Mother,81,14
10724,Ted,14, Not until game time.,2,How I Met Your Mother,21,4
10725,Barney,14, Where are you going?,2,How I Met Your Mother,21,4
10726,Ted,14, Pick up the hot wings.,2,How I Met Your Mother,23,5
10727,Barney,14, What? How the hell are you planning on getting in and out of a sports bar without seeing the score? There's TVs everywhere.,2,How I Met Your Mother,124,23
10728,Ted,14," Ah, don't worry. I got it all planned out. First of all",2,How I Met Your Mother,56,12
10730,Ted,14," Hello! Uh, my name is Ted Mosby. I'm here to pick up my hot wings. In my hand, you'll find the exact total for the wings plus a generous tip. Please take the cash. Put the wings in my hand and I'll be on my way. Thank you!",2,How I Met Your Mother,223,48
10736,Robin,14, I'm sorry.,2,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
10738,Robin,14," I haven't watched the game yet. I'm begging you, for the rest of the newscast there can't be any references to who won the Super Bowl. I mean, change the teleprompter. No team names, nothing specific.",2,How I Met Your Mother,201,36
10740,Robin,14, My friend Mark passed away this week.,2,How I Met Your Mother,38,7
10743,Robin,14, It's just so hard.,2,How I Met Your Mother,19,4
10745,Ted,14, Ha! Who's the idiot now?! You said the Sensory Deprivator 5000 was stupid. But it totally worked!  I couldn't see or hear anything happening around me. Right?! Right?!  No...!,2,How I Met Your Mother,176,29
10746,Ted,14," And if that weren't bad enough, I was about to have a horrible realization.",2,How I Met Your Mother,76,14
10747,Ted,14, Where's the dipping sauce?,2,How I Met Your Mother,27,4
10750,Marshall,14," Come on, dude. You promised you'd stop if I ate all those crayons. Why are you doing this?",2,How I Met Your Mother,91,18
10752,Marshall,14," Well, you can't have Miss Aldrin, she's mine.",2,How I Met Your Mother,46,8
10754,Lily,14," Okay, now who did this?",2,How I Met Your Mother,24,5
10755,Marshall,14, I did.,2,How I Met Your Mother,7,2
10757,Lily,14," Well, Marshall's a grownup, so...",2,How I Met Your Mother,34,5
10759,Lily,14, Sorry. Marshall gets a time-out.,2,How I Met Your Mother,33,5
10761,Robin,14," And after the Super Bowl, the mayor of the losing team's city had to pay up, sending the mayor of the winning team's city 15 pounds of a delicacy his of her city is famous for. Better fire up whatever type of grill, steamer or fryer one might use to cook that delicacy, Winning Team's Mayor.",2,How I Met Your Mother,292,56
10764,Marshall,14, I'm not talking to you.,2,How I Met Your Mother,24,5
10766,Marshall,14, I'm not holding my breath.,2,How I Met Your Mother,27,5
10768,Ted,14," And then Uncle Marshall got an idea. It was not one he was proud of in retrospect, but desperate times...",2,How I Met Your Mother,106,20
10770,Marshall,14," Oh, no. Somebody wet their pants.",2,How I Met Your Mother,34,6
10772,Marshall,14," Oh, really? Who's everyone gonna believe? I'm a grownup third-year law student at Columbia and you're just a little pants wetter. So now I ask you a question",2,How I Met Your Mother,158,28
10774,Marshall,14, I want my money back. And your pudding snack pack.,2,How I Met Your Mother,51,10
10776,Barney,14," Sir, who won the Super Bowl?",2,How I Met Your Mother,29,6
10778,Barney,14, You missed...?! How could he miss...? Excuse me! Who won the Super Bowl?!,2,How I Met Your Mother,74,13

10782,Barney,14," You got to tell me, who won the Super Bowl?",2,How I Met Your Mother,44,10
10784,Barney,14," But you're Emmitt Smith. You're a football player, it's Super Bowl Sunday. What could possibly be more important than football?!",2,How I Met Your Mother,129,20
10786,Barney,14, No...!,2,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
10788,Ted,14, Hello! It's me again.,2,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
10790,Ted,14," Yeah, you forgot to give me the dipping sauce! Ah. Yes. This is the one.",2,How I Met Your Mother,73,15
10791,Ted,14, It was 4,2,How I Met Your Mother,9,3
10793,Robin,14, And let's end the day on a happy note. There is a new arrival at the Bronx Zoo. Trish Sanchez has the story.,2,How I Met Your Mother,109,23
10806,Robin,14, No...!,2,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
10807,Marshall,14, No...!,2,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
10808,Barney,14, No...!,2,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
10810,Ted,14, Yes...!,2,How I Met Your Mother,8,1
10812,Ted,14," Awesome. Just in time for kick-off. None of you guys found out the score, right?",2,How I Met Your Mother,81,15
10813,Robin,14, Mission accomplished.,2,How I Met Your Mother,22,2
10814,Lily,14, Didn't find out.,2,How I Met Your Mother,17,3
10815,Ted,14," Great. Let's do it. I already fast-forwarded through the four hours of pre-game coverage. So we are ready.  Barney, I can't even look at you. I don't want any sign of who won.",2,How I Met Your Mother,176,33
10816,Ted,14," Don't worry, I'm not going to give anything away. Feel free to start without me. Ah...! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! So much money! You screwed it up, Barney! You screwed everything up! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Okay, let's watch the game.",2,How I Met Your Mother,233,39
10817,Ted,14," Barney, what the hell was that? We know who you bet on. Now you've ruined the game for everyone.",2,How I Met Your Mother,97,19
10818,Lily,14," Yeah. Thanks a lot, Barney.",2,How I Met Your Mother,28,5
10819,Robin,14, Way to blow it.,2,How I Met Your Mother,16,4
10820,Marshall,14," Yeah, I didn't know and now I do know.",2,How I Met Your Mother,39,9
10821,Ted,14, There's no point in even watching the game.,2,How I Met Your Mother,44,8
10822,Lily,14," Well, at least the commercials aren't ruined.",2,How I Met Your Mother,46,7
10823,Marshall,14, Wings are still good.,2,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
10824,Robin,14, Beer still works.,2,How I Met Your Mother,18,3
10825,Ted,14," Ah, what the hell. Let's watch Barney lose some money.",2,How I Met Your Mother,55,10
10826,Marshall,14," Hey, so check this out",2,How I Met Your Mother,23,5
10827,Robin,14, I almost got fired today.,2,How I Met Your Mother,26,5
10828,Barney,14, I met Emmitt Smith today.,2,How I Met Your Mother,26,5
10829,Lily,14," Ooh, you go first.",2,How I Met Your Mother,19,4
10830,Ted,14, I tried out the Sensory Deprivator 5000.,2,How I Met Your Mother,41,7
10831,Lily,14," Yeah, go ahead, Barney.",2,How I Met Your Mother,24,4
10832,Barney,14," Well, I was frantically running down the street trying to find out the score to the game...",2,How I Met Your Mother,92,17
10833,Ted,14," And here's the funny part, as unforgettable as that Super Bowl was, here it is 23 years later and I don't remember who won... Hell, I don't even remember who played. What I do remember is that we drank beer, we ate wings and we watched the Super Bowl together. Because sometimes, even if you know how something's going to end, that doesn't mean you can't enjoy the ride. We even raised a toast to good old Mike. I mean Mark. Matt. Crap! Why do I keep doing that?",2,How I Met Your Mother,463,89
10835,Barney,14," I didn't only lose the game, I lost every single prop bet. Total penalty yardage, number of replay-challenges, coin toss... What are the odds of losing the coin toss?",2,How I Met Your Mother,167,29
10836,Ted,14," 50-50, give or take.",2,How I Met Your Mother,21,4
10837,Barney,14," Interceptions, field-goals, total sacks, whether or not there'd be a safety, first...",2,How I Met Your Mother,86,12
10838,Ted,15," Kids, never underestimate the power of destiny. Because when you least expect it, the littlest thing can cause a ripple effect that changes your life. Take for instance my trip to Chicago.",2,How I Met Your Mother,189,32
10840,Robin,15, That security guard was a little bit handsy.,2,How I Met Your Mother,45,8
10841,Ted,15," That's funny. She barely touched me. Uh, Gate 23. Come on. If we miss this flight, I will never forgive myself.",2,How I Met Your Mother,112,21
10842,Ted,15, Why was this flight so important? Let's back up a few months to the fall of 2006. I had just sold my first building design and become the youngest project manager in my firm's history. Suddenly I was being headhunted. One firm was even considering me to run their entire New York office. They were flying me in for a final interview at their corporate headquarters in Chicago. It was the opportunity of a lifetime. It was my destiny. There was just one problem.,2,How I Met Your Mother,462,84
10844,Ted,15," Hi, wait, two more.",2,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
10846,Ted,15," Well, I'm sure if we pull real hard we can open them.",2,How I Met Your Mother,54,12
10848,Ted,15," Please, if-if I miss this flight, I'll miss the chance to interview for my dream job.",2,How I Met Your Mother,86,16
10850,Robin,15," His dream job! Didn't you ever have a dream job? Something from when you were a little girl, that was all you wanted to do? I mean, for God's sakes, I'm sure you didn't go to bed at night dreaming about being a... I mean, uh... This is a cool job.",2,How I Met Your Mother,248,51
10851,Ted,15," Please, I have to be on this flight.",2,How I Met Your Mother,37,8
10853,Ted,15, Thanks.,2,How I Met Your Mother,8,1
10854,Robin,15, Your uniforms are pretty.,2,How I Met Your Mother,26,4
10857,Ted,15," Great, please let us know as soon as you hear anything.",2,How I Met Your Mother,56,11
10859,Ted,15," Normally, I'm incredibly responsible. I just had to go to court this morning and get sentenced. Not that I'm a criminal or anything.",2,How I Met Your Mother,133,23
10862,Ted,15, That thing better have call waiting.,2,How I Met Your Mother,37,6
10863,Robin,15, Could you just call the firm and explain what happened?,2,How I Met Your Mother,56,10
10864,Ted,15, It's down to three people and I know they need to make their decision today. I sort of feel my not showing up might put me at a disadvantage. I'm so stupid. Why did I have to jump that turnstile?,2,How I Met Your Mother,196,40
10865,Robin,15," Hey, don't be so hard on yourself. And isn't this whole thing really Barney's fault?",2,How I Met Your Mother,85,15
10866,Ted,15, She had a point. It was kind of Barney's fault. Let's back up a few months.,2,How I Met Your Mother,76,16
10868,Robin,15," Oh, Marshall, how's the broken toe?",2,How I Met Your Mother,36,6
10869,Marshall,15," Oh, man, it kills.",2,How I Met Your Mother,19,4
10870,Lily,15," You want some aspirin, baby?",2,How I Met Your Mother,29,5
10871,Marshall,15, You know I don't believe in pain killers.,2,How I Met Your Mother,42,8
10872,Ted,15," Wow, your first broken bone. Kind of kills your whole ""Unbreakable"" theory.",2,How I Met Your Mother,76,12
10873,Lily,15, Marshall used to think he was indestructible.,2,How I Met Your Mother,46,7
10874,Marshall,15," Well, it added up. I've never broken anything. I've never been sick, and when I need to, I can summon incredible strength. Ted, tell her the story of the really heavy door.",2,How I Met Your Mother,173,32
10875,Ted,15, There was a really heavy door. He opened it.,2,How I Met Your Mother,45,9
10876,Marshall,15, On one pull.,2,How I Met Your Mother,13,3
10877,Robin,15," Well, you must be really bummed, you're not gonna be able to run tomorrow.",2,How I Met Your Mother,75,14
10878,Marshall,15," Yeah. It sucks, all that work I put in training for the marathon was a total waste.",2,How I Met Your Mother,84,17
10879,Barney,15, Training for a marathon.,2,How I Met Your Mother,25,4
10880,Marshall,15, What?,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
10881,Barney,15, You don't need to train for a marathon. You just run it.,2,How I Met Your Mother,57,12
10882,Marshall,15," You're kidding, right?",2,How I Met Your Mother,23,3
10883,Barney,15, Not at all. I could run a marathon anytime I wanted to.,2,How I Met Your Mother,56,12
10884,Marshall,15," So like tomorrow, you think you could wake up, roll out of bed, and just run the New York City Marathon?",2,How I Met Your Mother,105,21
10885,Barney,15, Absolutely.,2,How I Met Your Mother,12,1
10886,Robin,15," Barney, we're talking about 42 kilometers.",2,How I Met Your Mother,43,6
10887,Ted,15," Thanks, Canada. I'll take it from here. Barney, it's like 26 miles.",2,How I Met Your Mother,68,12
10888,Barney,15," Here's how you run a marathon. Step one, you start running. There is no step two.",2,How I Met Your Mother,82,16
10889,Marshall,15,,2,How I Met Your Mother,0,0
10891,Barney,15," 50 bucks? Gee, Grandpa, if I win, maybe I can buy myself an ice-cream cone. Make it $10,000.",2,How I Met Your Mother,93,18
10892,Marshall,15, You have a gambling problem. You'll bet me 50.,2,How I Met Your Mother,47,9
10893,Barney,15," Fine, then no bet. Okay, $50.",2,How I Met Your Mother,30,6
10894,Ted,15," The next morning, as the marathon began, we were focused on Marshall's computer.",2,How I Met Your Mother,81,13
10895,Marshall,15," Each runner gets a tracking chip so you can follow them online, see when they pass certain checkpoints. Barney's got mine in his shoe.",2,How I Met Your Mother,135,24
10896,Robin,15," Ooh, he's starting!",2,How I Met Your Mother,20,3
10897,Marshall,15, This ought to be good. Wow.  He's already passing the second checkpoint.,2,How I Met Your Mother,73,12
10898,Lily,15," This tracking thing is amazing. When we get married, you're getting one of these.",2,How I Met Your Mother,82,14
10900,Robin,15, Wow. Look at his time. It's pretty impressive.,2,How I Met Your Mother,47,8
10901,Marshall,15," He's gotta be cheating, okay. He knew we'd check.",2,How I Met Your Mother,50,9
10902,Ted,15," Yeah, he'll do anything to win a bet. Remember that time he bet me that Men at Work sang ""Hungry Like the Wolf,"" and when he found out that they didn't, he tried to hire them to?",2,How I Met Your Mother,179,37
10903,Marshall,15," Well, it looks like, ""Barney"" should be coming over the Queensboro Bridge and up First Avenue within the next hour or so. But... there is no way that that's really him.",2,How I Met Your Mother,169,31
10905,Marshall,15, It's really him.,2,How I Met Your Mother,17,3
10907,Lily,15," Hey! That's mine. Yeah, you'd better run!",2,How I Met Your Mother,42,7
10909,Barney,15," What up, non-finishers?",2,How I Met Your Mother,24,3
10910,Ted,15," Wow. Very impressive, Barney.",2,How I Met Your Mother,30,4
10911,Barney,15," Right? Yeah, my time would have been like a half an hour better, but I met this total hottie on Mile Seven. We took a quick detour and had our own mini marathon behind a Nathan's. I won.",2,How I Met Your Mother,187,38
10912,Lily,15, I'm not sure anyone in that story is a winner.,2,How I Met Your Mother,47,10
10913,Barney,15, So where's my 50 bucks?,2,How I Met Your Mother,24,5
10914,Marshall,15," All right. I got to admit, you earned this.",2,How I Met Your Mother,44,9
10915,Barney,15," Huh? Can't believe they haven't made a coin for this yet. Anyway, I'm heading home. Might go hit the gym.",2,How I Met Your Mother,106,20
10916,Marshall,15," Oh, hey, just so you know, uh, all marathon runners get to use the subway for free today.",2,How I Met Your Mother,90,18
10917,Barney,15," Wow. You know I really should check out this ""subway."" Heard so much about it. Wow. Look at me. Slumming it. Maybe I'll make a weekend out of it and I'll call my bridge and tunnel girl tonight.",2,How I Met Your Mother,194,38
10918,Ted,15, You're dating a girl from New Jersey?,2,How I Met Your Mother,38,7
10919,Barney,15, No.,2,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
10921,Ted,15, So Barney did it. He actually finished the marathon. But a little while later... I got an interesting phone call.,2,How I Met Your Mother,114,20
10922,Ted,15, Hello?,2,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
10923,Barney,15," Ted, it's Barney. Listen to me, I need you to come and pick me up on the subway.",2,How I Met Your Mother,81,18
10924,Ted,15," What, what are you talking about?",2,How I Met Your Mother,34,6
10925,Barney,15," I was sitting here, totally minding my own business.",2,How I Met Your Mother,53,9
10927,Barney,15," Finisher. Yeah, you know what I mean.",2,How I Met Your Mother,38,7
10931,Barney,15," My legs don't work. I've already ridden the subway twice end to end. I've seen where it turns around. Ted, you don't ever want to see where the subway turns around.",2,How I Met Your Mother,165,31
10932,Ted,15,  Barney's legs won't work. He's riding the subway from end to end because he physically can't get off the train.,2,How I Met Your Mother,113,20
10933,Marshall,15, Best 50 bucks I ever spent.,2,How I Met Your Mother,28,6
10934,Barney,15," Listen to me, Ted. I'm going to lose you any second. I'm on the fourth car of the six train heading south from Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx. Meet me at the 86th Street station in, like, half an hour?",2,How I Met Your Mother,200,41
10935,Ted,15, All right. I'll be right there. Stay where you are.,2,How I Met Your Mother,52,10
10936,Barney,15," Ted, Ted.",2,How I Met Your Mother,10,2
10939,Barney,15, I'm sorry. I can't.,2,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
10942,Ted,15, Barney?!,2,How I Met Your Mother,9,1
10943,Barney,15, Ted!,2,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
10946,Barney,15, No...!,2,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
10948,Robin,15," See? If Barney never tried to run the marathon, you never would have jumped that turnstile, you wouldn't have had that court date today, and we would have made this flight.",2,How I Met Your Mother,173,31
10949,Ted,15, You're right. Everything can be traced back to him. Like that rash we all got at Christmas. I have to see what's going on.,2,How I Met Your Mother,123,24
10951,Ted,15, Really? That's great!,2,How I Met Your Mother,22,3
10953,Ted,15," Okay, what about our flight? Can we get on?",2,How I Met Your Mother,44,9
10955,Ted,15," What? No, n-n-n-no, n-no. I have to be in Chicago today.",2,How I Met Your Mother,57,11
10956,Robin,15," Well, he never even called you back?",2,How I Met Your Mother,37,7
10958,Ted,15," It turned out there was one other flight that would just barely get me to Chicago on time for my job interview, but it was all the way on the other side of the airport.",2,How I Met Your Mother,169,35
10959,Robin,15, What was the name of the airline again?,2,How I Met Your Mother,40,8
10960,Ted,15, I think it was something like Flights R' Us.,2,How I Met Your Mother,45,9
10961,Robin,15," Was the ""R"" backwards?",2,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
10962,Ted,15," God, I hope not.",2,How I Met Your Mother,17,4
10963,Robin,15, Geez.,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
10964,Ted,15, Stupid smart carts. More like dumb carts.,2,How I Met Your Mother,42,7
10965,Robin,15," If we miss this flight, it's all Barney's fault.",2,How I Met Your Mother,49,9
10966,Ted,15," You know, Barney never would have run the marathon in the first place if Marshall hadn't broken his toe.",2,How I Met Your Mother,105,19
10967,Robin,15," Yeah, so? What, you think this is my fault?",2,How I Met Your Mother,44,9
10968,Ted,15," For Marshall, the initial idea to run the marathon came way back in April.",2,How I Met Your Mother,75,14
10971,Marshall,15, My pants are starting to feel a little tight.,2,How I Met Your Mother,46,9
10972,Lily,15," Oh, that's okay. I love that cute little belly.",2,How I Met Your Mother,48,9
10973,Marshall,15, I cannot allow this.,2,How I Met Your Mother,21,4
10974,Lily,15, What?,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
10975,Marshall,15, I am going to run the New York City Marathon.,2,How I Met Your Mother,46,10
10977,Lily,15," ""It is important to load up on carbohydrates two to four hours before a big run. Try a breakfast of a bagel, a banana, oatmeal, strawberries and some orange juice."" Here you go, Marshmallow. Just like the book said.",2,How I Met Your Mother,216,39
10978,Marshall,15," Yeah, but from now on, I'm eating all of my breakfast runner-style. Liquids are digested faster. That way, no energy is wasted, and it's all about the run.",2,How I Met Your Mother,156,28
10979,Lily,15," ""Don't forget to give yourself plenty of positive reinforcement.""",2,How I Met Your Mother,66,9
10980,Marshall,15, This is gonna be your best run yet. You're going to accomplish all of your goals. You are a robot sent from the future to win the marathon! You are... Marshall. You are... Marshall. You are Marshall! Yeah!,2,How I Met Your Mother,206,38
10981,Lily,15," ""Chafing or blisters can occur in a number of areas, including the feet, armpits, or even the nipples. Try using some petroleum jelly on the affected areas.""",2,How I Met Your Mother,158,27
10983,Marshall,15," Oh, gosh! Dude, you are a terrific runner. Tomorrow you're gonna run and finish the New York City Marathon! You're the best. You look good. Nobody does it better than you.",2,How I Met Your Mother,172,31
10985,Robin,15," Marshall? Oh, my God!",2,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
10987,Ted,15," So, yes, it was your fault. I mean, if you don't show up at the apartment in the middle of the day, Marshall doesn't break his toe, Barney doesn't run in his place, I don't jump the turnstile and get a court date, and we make our flight in plenty of time!  And I don't fall down and bite my tongue at the airport.",2,How I Met Your Mother,314,64
10988,Robin,15, That really wasn't my fault. I wouldn't have walked in on,2,How I Met Your Mother,58,11
10991,Robin,15," Hey, what's going on here?",2,How I Met Your Mother,27,5
10992,Ted,15," Oh, looks like they're camping out for something.",2,How I Met Your Mother,50,8
10993,Robin,15," Yeah, but for what?",2,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
10994,Ted,15," I don't know. Usually there's a Stormtrooper or Klingon in line to give you some indication. ""Annual wedding dress blowout. Designer sample dresses up to 90% off. Doors open tomorrow, 8",2,How I Met Your Mother,186,31
10995,Robin,15," Oh, my God. Can you believe what some nut bags will do to save a few bucks?",2,How I Met Your Mother,76,17
10997,Lily,15, We have to camp out.,2,How I Met Your Mother,21,5
10998,Robin,15, Are you serious?,2,How I Met Your Mother,17,3
10999,Lily,15," You don't understand. This is an amazing sale. I've heard about it before, but I never knew where it was. We'll have a wedding dress campout. It'll be fun.",2,How I Met Your Mother,156,29
11000,Barney,15,  I can't go. I've got this thing.,2,How I Met Your Mother,34,7
11001,Lily,15, What thing?,2,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
11002,Barney,15, A pen1s.,2,How I Met Your Mother,9,2
11004,Robin,15, This is the place.,2,How I Met Your Mother,19,4
11005,Lily,15," Oh, wow. Badgley Mischka! Melissa Sweet! Vera Wang! Oh, Robin, do you have any idea what you guys stumbled onto here?",2,How I Met Your Mother,118,21
11006,Robin,15, You said wang.,2,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
11007,Lily,15," Oh, this reminds me of the ticket line to Lilith Fair, 1998. Only fewer mullets.",2,How I Met Your Mother,81,15
11008,Robin,15," You should feel good. You're only, like, the tenth craziest bride in New York.",2,How I Met Your Mother,79,14
11009,Lily,15," Ooh, this is comfy. We might actually be able to sleep.",2,How I Met Your Mother,56,11
11011,Robin,15, That's kind of annoying.,2,How I Met Your Mother,25,4
11012,Lily,15," Well, I'm sure somebody will be out here to turn it off any minute.  I don't think I can take this. Every time it turns off, I think, oh, maybe it won't turn on again, but then it does. Why does it, Robin? Why does it keep turning on?",2,How I Met Your Mother,235,49
11013,Robin,15," It's gonna be okay, sweetie. Why... Why don't we make a game out of it, okay? Why don't we sing along?",2,How I Met Your Mother,103,21
11015,Lily,15," If we get through this, I swear I'm gonna live my life differently.",2,How I Met Your Mother,68,13
11016,Robin,15, I just want to tell my parents I love them one more time.,2,How I Met Your Mother,58,13
11019,Lily,15, It's him. It's the car guy!,2,How I Met Your Mother,28,6
11020,Robin,15, Get out of here!,2,How I Met Your Mother,17,4
11022,Ted,15," The next morning, Robin was too tired to go all the way back to Brooklyn, so while I was at work, she went to crash at my apartment for a couple hours, and that's when...",2,How I Met Your Mother,171,35
11023,Marshall,15, Nobody does it better than you.,2,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
11024,Robin,15," Marshall?! Oh, my God! ",2,How I Met Your Mother,24,4
11026,Robin,15," So if Lily hadn't dragged me down to the wedding dress store, we would have made the first flight.",2,How I Met Your Mother,99,19
11027,Ted,15," Oh, thank God. The doors are still open. We made it. Hi. Please. We really need to get on this flight.",2,How I Met Your Mother,103,21
11029,Robin,15," Yes, yes, I am. I can't believe you recognized me.",2,How I Met Your Mother,51,10
11031,Ted,15, Would you check to see if you have any more seats?,2,How I Met Your Mother,51,11
11033,Ted,15, Robin...,2,How I Met Your Mother,9,1
11034,Robin,15,"  One second, Ted. Um, you know, a lot of people ask me that. The truth is,",2,How I Met Your Mother,75,16
11037,Robin,15," God, it is so nice to meet a fan! And I would be a fan of your work if you could get us two seats on that next flight.",2,How I Met Your Mother,119,29
11039,Ted,15, Would it help if I got on and gave an impassioned speech about my destiny?,2,How I Met Your Mother,75,15
11041,Robin,15," Okay, so we agree? This goes back to Lily wanting to camp out for a wedding dress?",2,How I Met Your Mother,83,17
11042,Ted,15, No. Wait. It goes back further. Remember why we were eating hot dogs on the East Side?,2,How I Met Your Mother,87,17
11044,Ted,15, 1939?! This penny's from 1939!  A 67-year-old penny. Do you realize this penny was minted during World War II?,2,How I Met Your Mother,111,19
11045,Robin,15," Oh, so was my grandfather, but that doesn't make him interesting.",2,How I Met Your Mother,66,11
11046,Ted,15," Look, I know a little something about coins, and this baby is worth something to a collector.",2,How I Met Your Mother,94,17
11047,Robin,15," No, it's not.",2,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
11048,Ted,15," Yes, it is! You know what? I'm gonna take you out to dinner with the money I get for this little guy.",2,How I Met Your Mother,102,22
11049,Ted,15, And that's exactly what I did.,2,How I Met Your Mother,31,6
11051,Robin,15, You're lucky there's still a place that serves anything for a dollar fifty.,2,How I Met Your Mother,76,13
11052,Ted,15," Hey, that's 150 times its original value. Actually, the meal was only $1.49. 1984.",2,How I Met Your Mother,83,14
11053,Robin,15," Hey, in 50 years, we can get dinner again.",2,How I Met Your Mother,43,9
11054,Ted,15, How dare you.,2,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
11055,Robin,15," Hey, what's going on?",2,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
11056,Ted,15, I don't know. Looks like they're camping out for something.,2,How I Met Your Mother,60,10
11057,Robin,15," Yeah, but for what?",2,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
11059,Ted,15," It was me. I started this. If I hadn't picked up that penny, we wouldn't have gone to get hot dogs all the way across town.",2,How I Met Your Mother,124,26
11060,Robin,15," And we wouldn't have seen that wedding dress store, Lily wouldn't have wanted to camp out there, and I wouldn't have needed a nap at your apartment the next day.",2,How I Met Your Mother,162,30
11061,Ted,15," Marshall wouldn't have broken his toe. Barney wouldn't have run the marathon. I wouldn't have jumped that turnstile, gotten arrested, had that court date...",2,How I Met Your Mother,157,24
11062,Robin,15, And we would have made our flight. I don't think we can go back any further than that unless you know who dropped the penny.,2,How I Met Your Mother,125,25
11063,Ted,15," I wish I did. Though that person's already been punished enough, losing a sweet penny like that.",2,How I Met Your Mother,97,17
11065,Ted,15," Oh, please tell me you have some good news.",2,How I Met Your Mother,44,9
11067,Robin,15," All, right, well, thanks for trying.",2,How I Met Your Mother,37,6
11068,Ted,15," I can't believe this. That's it, it's over.",2,How I Met Your Mother,44,8
11069,Robin,15," Ted, come on. Your destiny just wasn't to make it to Chicago today. Anyway, if that firm really wants you, they'll reschedule.",2,How I Met Your Mother,127,22
11070,Ted,15," But that's not what happened. They didn't reschedule. They hired someone else. And as it turned out, three months later, that guy ended up having to relocate to Chicago. Kids, funny thing about destiny, I thought I was destined to get that job. But I was wrong. My destiny was to stay in New York. Because if I hadn't, I never would have met your mother.",2,How I Met Your Mother,355,66
11071,Ted,16," Kids, the key to a good relationship is communication. You need to talk.",2,How I Met Your Mother,73,13
11073,Robin,16, How about Mimi's?,2,How I Met Your Mother,18,3
11074,Ted,16," Nah, I don't really feel like Mimi's.",2,How I Met Your Mother,38,7
11075,Robin,16," Well, I'm hungry. Let's just pick a place and go.",2,How I Met Your Mother,50,10
11076,Ted,16," Oh, you know where we should go? Cynthia's. You love that place, remember what a great time we had the last time we were there?",2,How I Met Your Mother,128,25
11077,Robin,16, We did?,2,How I Met Your Mother,8,2
11078,Ted,16," Yeah, yeah. We had that crazy waiter who kept going, ""You two should get married! You two should get married!""",2,How I Met Your Mother,111,20
11079,Ted,16, It's also important to know when to stop talking.,2,How I Met Your Mother,50,9
11080,Ted,16, Come on. Then we stepped outside. It was raining. It was so romantic? How can you not remember this?,2,How I Met Your Mother,101,19
11081,Robin,16, Because it wasn't me.,2,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
11082,Ted,16," Oh, right! It was... my sister.",2,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
11083,Ted,16," You see, by the time you've hit your late 20s, you've dated a few people, but when you're in a relationship, it's common courtesy to pretend that you haven't.",2,How I Met Your Mother,159,29
11085,Ted,16," Oh, my God, Van Helsing is on. Remember when we went to see it? We sat in the back row.",2,How I Met Your Mother,88,20
11086,Robin,16, I've never seen Van Helsing.,2,How I Met Your Mother,29,5
11087,Ted,16,  That's right. I saw it with my sister.,2,How I Met Your Mother,40,8
11088,Robin,16, My boss just got back from Maui. He said it was really romantic.,2,How I Met Your Mother,65,13
11089,Ted,16," Oh, it's so romantic.",2,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
11090,Robin,16, When were you in Maui?,2,How I Met Your Mother,23,5
11091,Ted,16, I... went... with my sister.,2,How I Met Your Mother,29,5
11092,Robin,16," With my sister. Why do you always say that? Look, we're not 16. We've both dated other people. It's silly to try to act like we didn't.",2,How I Met Your Mother,136,27
11093,Ted,16, You're right. We should just be honest.,2,How I Met Your Mother,40,7
11094,Robin,16, Totally.,2,How I Met Your Mother,9,1
11096,Ted,16," See that girl over there? Three years ago, I totally made out with her.",2,How I Met Your Mother,72,14
11097,Robin,16, I don't want to hear that.,2,How I Met Your Mother,27,6
11098,Ted,16, What? You said...,2,How I Met Your Mother,18,3
11099,Robin,16," God, that is so insensitive.",2,How I Met Your Mother,29,5
11100,Ted,16, Remember honesty...?,2,How I Met Your Mother,21,2
11101,Robin,16, You're a jerk!,2,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
11102,Ted,16," Well, you're...confusing.",2,How I Met Your Mother,26,2
11105,Marshall,16," Okay, so you have to have s*x with one. Either classic mermaid; bottom half fish, top half human, or inverted mermaid, top half fish, bottom half human. Go!",2,How I Met Your Mother,157,28
11106,Barney,16, I don't know. Is she fat?,2,How I Met Your Mother,26,6
11107,Marshall,16," Yeah, but it's a fish, so it's the good kind of fat.",2,How I Met Your Mother,53,12
11108,Lily,16, Hot off the presses!,2,How I Met Your Mother,21,4
11109,Barney,16, I-I don't take flyers.,2,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
11110,Marshall,16, You took one two seconds before you walked in here.,2,How I Met Your Mother,52,10
11111,Barney,16, That's different. It was for a strip club. Two bucks off wings. How much is your flyer going to save me on wings?,2,How I Met Your Mother,114,23
11112,Lily,16, Fine. It's a flyer from my play.,2,How I Met Your Mother,33,7
11113,Barney,16," Oh, Lily, I'd love to, but we're not in college and I'm not trying to sleep with you. So anyway, this mermaid...",2,How I Met Your Mother,113,22
11114,Marshall,16," Hey, Lily's friend asked her to be in this play, and it's gonna be really good.",2,How I Met Your Mother,80,16
11115,Barney,16," Lily, I love you, but we're too old for this. Asking someone to come see your play is like asking someone for a ride to the airport or to crash on your couch or to help you move. Call a cab, book a room, hire some movers and repeat after me",2,How I Met Your Mother,241,51
11116,Ted,16," Okay, first of all, I've thought about it and top half fish. Second of all, we need you guys to decide something for us.",2,How I Met Your Mother,121,24
11117,Barney,16," Yes, you should break up.",2,How I Met Your Mother,26,5
11118,Ted,16," So, earlier tonight...",2,How I Met Your Mother,23,3
11120,Robin,16," Mm, we should get down to the bar.",2,How I Met Your Mother,35,8
11121,Ted,16," I know we should, but you just look so sexy in my red sweatshirt.",2,How I Met Your Mother,66,14
11123,Barney,16," Oh, God, why is this part of the story?",2,How I Met Your Mother,40,9
11124,Ted,16, We're getting to it.,2,How I Met Your Mother,21,4
11126,Robin,16," Damn, my face is so dry. Is there any moisturizer around here?",2,How I Met Your Mother,63,12
11127,Ted,16," Yeah, there's some in the bathroom. Got to moisturize! Got to keep that pretty face moist.",2,How I Met Your Mother,91,16
11129,Lily,16," Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!",2,How I Met Your Mother,28,7
11130,Barney,16, What's wrong with her?,2,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
11131,Marshall,16, She hates that word.,2,How I Met Your Mother,21,4
11132,Barney,16," What word, ""moist""?",2,How I Met Your Mother,20,3
11133,Lily,16," No! Seriously, stop!",2,How I Met Your Mother,21,3
11134,Robin,16," So, anyway, Ted goes into the bathroom to get the moist... face lotion...",2,How I Met Your Mother,74,13
11136,Robin,16," Wow, this is great stuff. Now I know the secret to your great complexion.",2,How I Met Your Mother,74,14
11137,Ted,16, What are you talking about? It's yours.,2,How I Met Your Mother,40,7
11138,Robin,16," No, it's not.",2,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
11139,Ted,16," Oh, well... then I guess it's Lily's.",2,How I Met Your Mother,38,7
11141,Lily,16," No, it's not.",2,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
11143,Robin,16," Whose moisturizer is this, Ted?",2,How I Met Your Mother,32,5
11144,Ted,16," Um, my sister's.",2,How I Met Your Mother,17,3
11145,Robin,16," So, in other words, some girl you went out with.",2,How I Met Your Mother,49,10
11146,Ted,16, Um... I love you.,2,How I Met Your Mother,18,4
11147,Robin,16, Disgusting. You let me put on the same moisturizer as one of your exes?,2,How I Met Your Mother,72,14
11149,Lily,16, It was probably Carla's. Her face was a train wreck.,2,How I Met Your Mother,53,10
11150,Marshall,16, I'm don't think Ted was dating her for her face.,2,How I Met Your Mother,49,10
11151,Ted,16," Thank you, Marshall. Thank you so much.",2,How I Met Your Mother,40,7
11153,Robin,16, Why is that still in your apartment?,2,How I Met Your Mother,37,7
11154,Ted,16, I don't know. I just never threw it out.,2,How I Met Your Mother,41,9
11155,Robin,16," Well, why not? Do you still have feelings for this girl?",2,How I Met Your Mother,57,11
11156,Ted,16," Yeah. I'm madly in love with her, and the only way I can deal with it is by holding onto a three-dollar tube of lotion.",2,How I Met Your Mother,120,25
11157,Robin,16, Not three dollars! Try 14.,2,How I Met Your Mother,27,5
11158,Ted,16, Why is this such a big deal?,2,How I Met Your Mother,29,7
11159,Robin,16, Because I don't want to use some whore's moisturizer!,2,How I Met Your Mother,54,9
11160,Ted,16," Whoa, she wasn't a whore.",2,How I Met Your Mother,26,5
11161,Robin,16," Well, she's leaving expensive lotions all over town. It sounds like a whore to me. What else do you have from old girlfriends just lying around?",2,How I Met Your Mother,145,26
11162,Ted,16," Nothing. That's it. Well, except for the phone booth. And the lamp by the desk... and the...",2,How I Met Your Mother,93,17
11163,Robin,16," No. No! No! Oh, Ted!",2,How I Met Your Mother,21,5
11165,Lily,16," Ah, the age-old question",2,How I Met Your Mother,25,4
11166,Robin,16," Question? Ain't no question, girl. Obviously, he's got to get rid of it.",2,How I Met Your Mother,73,13
11167,Ted,16," Which is obviously crazy and obviously, I'm not gonna do it.",2,How I Met Your Mother,61,11
11168,Robin,16, So we agreed that we would let you guys decide.,2,How I Met Your Mother,48,10
11169,Ted,16," Yeah, like we did with Marshall's pants.",2,How I Met Your Mother,41,7
11170,Barney,16," Ah, the 2005 landmark case of Lily v. The Joey Buttafuoco Pants.",2,How I Met Your Mother,65,12
11172,Marshall,16," Nice, right?",2,How I Met Your Mother,13,2
11173,Robin,16, I'm gonna have to say no. I don't want some 16-year-old,2,How I Met Your Mother,56,11
11175,Lily,16, Yes!,2,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
11176,Barney,16," I vote they can stay. ""Check out the jackass in the parachute pants"" is a good icebreaker.",2,How I Met Your Mother,91,17
11177,Marshall,16, Ted. Ted? Ted?,2,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
11178,Ted,16," Sorry, buddy, it's a ""no"" for me, too. Oh, and by the way, Bel Biv Devoe called. Even they don't want those pants back.",2,How I Met Your Mother,120,24
11180,Marshall,16, They were insanely comfortable! They were like pajamas you could wear outside.,2,How I Met Your Mother,79,12
11181,Barney,16," Marshall, it's over. We even gave you an appeal and they didn't look any better with combat boots.",2,How I Met Your Mother,99,18
11182,Lily,16," All right, well, let's hear the arguments. Ted, you go first.",2,How I Met Your Mother,62,11
11183,Ted,16," Okay. The fact that I still have things from ex-girlfriends is no big deal. I mean, when I see the phone booth on the piano, I don't think of Jeannie Radford, I think of the good times I had backpacking through Europe. And when I see the lamp, I don't think of Allison Moses. I remember when I was broke, just out of college, and I really needed a lamp. And when I see that throw pillow, I don't think of Lauren Stein. I think of that weird orange-brown stain and how it got there.",2,How I Met Your Mother,482,95
11184,Marshall,16," Creamsicle and turkey gravy, not at the same time.",2,How I Met Your Mother,51,9
11185,Robin,16," Well, that's adorable, but from now on, when I walk into the apartment, here is what I will see.",2,How I Met Your Mother,97,19
11192,Ted,16, Really? You can't look at a pillow without seeing my ex-girlfriend-- a pillow!,2,How I Met Your Mother,79,13
11193,Robin,16," Yes, Ted, the fact that you still have that pillow is creepy and gross.",2,How I Met Your Mother,72,14
11194,Ted,16, You're creepy and gross.,2,How I Met Your Mother,25,4
11195,Robin,16, Your mom's creepy and gross.,2,How I Met Your Mother,29,5
11196,Lily,16," Order! Order! I got to side with Robin. She's your girlfriend, and if the stuff upsets her, you got to get rid of it.",2,How I Met Your Mother,118,24
11197,Marshall,16, I've got to side with Ted. Just 'cause you still have something an ex girlfriend gave you doesn't mean you're holding onto her.,2,How I Met Your Mother,128,23
11198,Ted,16," All right, Barney. It all comes down to you.",2,How I Met Your Mother,45,9
11199,Barney,16, I side with Robin.,2,How I Met Your Mother,19,4
11200,Ted,16, What?,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
11201,Barney,16," Ted, your place is too cluttered. It's like you're living in a Bennigan's.",2,How I Met Your Mother,75,13
11202,Robin,16," Or a Danby's. What, they don't have Danby's in the US? Really? Well, then were do you get Grizzly Paw ice cream sandwiches?",2,How I Met Your Mother,124,23
11203,Ted,16," Just stop, sweetie.",2,How I Met Your Mother,20,3
11205,Ted,16," So I had no choice. I packed up everything I had gotten from ex-girlfriends. It was painful, but not as painful as what I had to endure later that night. New York is famous for its theater, but there's many different levels. There's Broadway, off-Broadway, off-off-Broadway, homeless people screaming in the park, and then below that, the play Aunt Lily was in.",2,How I Met Your Mother,362,62
11207,Robin,16," Eight flights, of stairs. Who puts a theater up eight flights of stairs? What kind of building is this?",2,How I Met Your Mother,104,19
11208,Barney,16," From the smell of it, I'm guessing a urine factory.",2,How I Met Your Mother,52,10
11209,Ted,16, Where do you guys want to sit?,2,How I Met Your Mother,31,7
11210,Barney,16, I know where I don't want to sit.,2,How I Met Your Mother,34,8
11211,Marshall,16," Guys, four together!",2,How I Met Your Mother,21,3
11212,Barney,16, I brought a bag in case anyone needs to puke.,2,How I Met Your Mother,46,10
11213,Robin,16, Come on. It's not gonna be that bad.,2,How I Met Your Mother,37,8
11214,Barney,16, No? Okay.,2,How I Met Your Mother,10,2
11219,Lily,16, I am Rage... Envy!,2,How I Met Your Mother,19,4
11220,Barney,16, I am outta here.,2,How I Met Your Mother,17,4
11221,Marshall,16," No, you're not. You have to stay.",2,How I Met Your Mother,34,7
11222,Lily,16, This is the face of Consumerism!,2,How I Met Your Mother,33,6
11223,Marshall,16," Oh, my God. Ted's part of the play.",2,How I Met Your Mother,36,8
11226,Marshall,16," Oh, baby, that was wonderful!",2,How I Met Your Mother,30,5
11227,Ted,16," Totally, I had no idea Greed was the killer.",2,How I Met Your Mother,45,9
11228,Robin,16," And when it became a play within a play, I was, like, ""Now we are really cookin'!""",2,How I Met Your Mother,83,17
11229,Barney,16," Wow, Lily, that sucked!",2,How I Met Your Mother,24,4
11230,Marshall,16, Barney!,2,How I Met Your Mother,8,1
11231,Barney,16," What? It was terrible. I mean, come on. You guys agree, right? Hey, sorry, I'm just being honest 'cause, you know, we're friends.",2,How I Met Your Mother,130,23
11232,Lily,16," No, friends make each other feel good. They build each other up and support them. That's what being a good friend is about.",2,How I Met Your Mother,124,23
11233,Barney,16," Yeah, if you're a Smurf.",2,How I Met Your Mother,25,5
11234,Lily,16," You know if you did a play, I would sit through the whole thing and I would compliment you on it afterwards.",2,How I Met Your Mother,109,22
11235,Barney,16," Oh, really? You would?",2,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
11236,Lily,16, Yes.,2,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
11237,Barney,16," Bad move, Aldrin, bad move.",2,How I Met Your Mother,28,5
11240,Robin,16, Can you believe Barney said that about Lily's play?,2,How I Met Your Mother,52,9
11241,Ted,16, I know. He can be really insensitive.,2,How I Met Your Mother,38,7
11242,Robin,16," It was pretty bad, though.",2,How I Met Your Mother,27,5
11243,Ted,16," Oh, my God, it was so bad.",2,How I Met Your Mother,27,7
11244,Robin,16," Oh, my God, you've been robbed!",2,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
11245,Ted,16, Nope.,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
11246,Robin,16, All that stuff was from old girlfriends? Don't you buy anything for yourself?,2,How I Met Your Mother,78,13
11247,Ted,16, What can I say? Papa gets swag.,2,How I Met Your Mother,32,7
11248,Ted,16, And that should've been the end of it. But the next day...,2,How I Met Your Mother,59,12
11250,Ted,16," You know, at first I was really bummed about getting rid of all my stuff. But seeing how happy it makes you - totally worth it.",2,How I Met Your Mother,128,26
11251,Robin,16," Mm, that's kind of how I feel when I begrudgingly have s*x with you when I'm really tired.",2,How I Met Your Mother,91,18
11252,Ted,16," Exactly. Sometimes you gotta take one for the team. Well, sit. Sit, yeah. So you never keep anything your ex-boyfriends gave you?",2,How I Met Your Mother,130,22
11253,Robin,16," Nope. Well, except for my dogs.",2,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
11255,Ted,16," So I had to get rid of everything from my past relationships because you don't keep things from your past relationships except, uh, where are your five dogs from? Oh, that's right",2,How I Met Your Mother,180,32
11256,Robin,16," What's your point, Ted?",2,How I Met Your Mother,24,4
11257,Ted,16," Well, you know how you said you come over to my apartment, and all you can see are my ex-girlfriends?",2,How I Met Your Mother,102,20
11258,Robin,16," What, so when you look at my dogs, all you see is my ex-boyfriends?",2,How I Met Your Mother,68,14
11259,Ted,16, I do now.,2,How I Met Your Mother,10,3
11260,Robin,16, That's ridiculous.,2,How I Met Your Mother,19,2
11261,Ted,16," I thought you said you got rid of everything your ex-boyfriends gave you. Well, yeah, but not my dogs.",2,How I Met Your Mother,103,19
11262,Ted,16, You said everything.,2,How I Met Your Mother,21,3
11263,Robin,16, But not living things.,2,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
11264,Ted,16," Well, tell that to the rare Bolivian cactus I threw away.",2,How I Met Your Mother,58,11
11265,Robin,16, Things with a heartbeat can stay.,2,How I Met Your Mother,34,6
11266,Ted,16, Enjoying this?,2,How I Met Your Mother,15,2
11267,Robin,16," Pickles, go get your ball. Go get your ball.",2,How I Met Your Mother,45,9
11268,Ted,16, Just admit it. It was a little hypocritical of you to make me get rid of all my stuff.,2,How I Met Your Mother,87,19
11269,Robin,16," Well, what do you want me to do, Ted? Get rid of my dogs?",2,How I Met Your Mother,58,14
11272,Ted,16," Yes. Yes, I want you to get rid of your dogs.",2,How I Met Your Mother,46,11
11273,Robin,16," Um, no.",2,How I Met Your Mother,8,2
11274,Ted,16," Really? Well, I say we take it to the group, but I don't like your chances.",2,How I Met Your Mother,76,16
11276,Marshall,16, She's not getting rid of the dogs.,2,How I Met Your Mother,35,7
11277,Lily,16, What's the matter with you?,2,How I Met Your Mother,28,5
11278,Barney,16, Even I wouldn't do that.,2,How I Met Your Mother,25,5
11279,Robin,16, Yes!,2,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
11280,Lily,16," You can ask somebody to get rid of their iguana after it poops in your hair, but not their dog.",2,How I Met Your Mother,96,20
11281,Marshall,16, I miss Jebediah.,2,How I Met Your Mother,17,3
11282,Barney,16," Oh, I almost forgot. Flyers for my new play.",2,How I Met Your Mother,45,9
11283,Lily,16, Very funny.,2,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
11284,Barney,16," Oh, it's not a joke. It's my one-man show premiering tomorrow night. And even though it's terrible and excruciatingly long, I expect you all to be there since we're such good friends.",2,How I Met Your Mother,184,32
11285,Lily,16," Oh, we'll be there.",2,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
11286,Barney,16," Unless, of course, you just want to admit that you were wrong...",2,How I Met Your Mother,65,12
11287,Lily,16, Never.,2,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
11288,Barney,16," Good. Okay, I gotta go rehearse. Oh, I almost forgot. Bring a poncho; the first three rows get wet.",2,How I Met Your Mother,100,19
11290,Robin,16, I'm sorry I didn't tell you where the dogs came from.,2,How I Met Your Mother,54,11
11291,Ted,16, I'm sorry I asked you to get rid of them. That was ridiculous.,2,How I Met Your Mother,63,13
11292,Robin,16, So we're-we're okay?,2,How I Met Your Mother,21,3
11293,Ted,16," Yeah, we're great.",2,How I Met Your Mother,19,3
11294,Ted,16," And I thought we were, but just as it did in the seventh act of Aunt Lily's play, Jealousy reared its ugly head.",2,How I Met Your Mother,113,23
11299,Ted,16, I gotta go.,2,How I Met Your Mother,12,3
11301,Lily,16," Oh, he's really having trouble dealing with this, huh?",2,How I Met Your Mother,55,9
11302,Robin,16," Yeah, he really is. It's got me thinking, maybe I should get rid of my dogs. Might be time to send them to the farm.",2,How I Met Your Mother,117,25
11303,Lily,16, You're gonna kill your dogs?!,2,How I Met Your Mother,30,5
11304,Robin,16," No! No, no, no, there really is a farm. My aunt has a farm upstate.",2,How I Met Your Mother,68,15
11305,Lily,16," Oh, thank God. Aw, you know, if I were five dogs, I'd rather live on a farm than in an apartment in Brooklyn.",2,How I Met Your Mother,110,23
11306,Robin,16," Yeah. I could visit them on weekends. My aunt is awfully lonely up there. It's just her and her lover, Betty.",2,How I Met Your Mother,110,21
11307,Lily,16," Oh, that's perfect. They love dogs.",2,How I Met Your Mother,36,6
11308,Robin,16," ""They""? What do you mean by ""they""?",2,How I Met Your Mother,36,7
11309,Lily,16," Uh... uh.... uh... People upstate. Oh, look, it's starting. Shh!",2,How I Met Your Mother,65,10
11310,Marshall,16," Are you sure you're gonna be okay? I mean, you know that this is gonna be...",2,How I Met Your Mother,77,16
11311,Lily,16," I know, but I'm gonna sit through the whole thing, and I'm gonna say something nice about it afterwards. You know why? Because that's what friends do.",2,How I Met Your Mother,151,27
11313,Barney,16, Moist. Moist. Moist. Moist.,2,How I Met Your Mother,28,4
11314,Ted,16, That was the first 40 minutes of Barney's show.,2,How I Met Your Mother,48,9
11315,Barney,16, Moist.,2,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
11316,Ted,16, And then we endured about 20 minutes of this.,2,How I Met Your Mother,46,9
11318,Barney,16, I have to go refill. I'll be back in a moment. Play's not over.,2,How I Met Your Mother,64,14
11319,Marshall,16, I never get picked for audience participation.,2,How I Met Your Mother,47,7
11320,Ted,16, And then it just got weird.,2,How I Met Your Mother,28,6
11321,Barney,16," Feelings. Inside. Oh, no!",2,How I Met Your Mother,26,4
11322,Ted,16, And when that didn't work...,2,How I Met Your Mother,29,5
11323,Lily,16," Okay! Stop! You win. Fine. Barney, I'm sorry I made you come to my show.",2,How I Met Your Mother,73,15
11324,Barney,16," Thank you, Lily. Is there anything you'd like to say about my show?",2,How I Met Your Mother,68,13
11325,Lily,16," No. No, I have nothing nice to say about your show. You were right, Barney. Let's go to the bar.",2,How I Met Your Mother,97,20
11326,Barney,16," Yes! I win! I love winning! Oh, Lily. Oh, Lily, Lily, Lily. I was just getting",2,How I Met Your Mother,79,16
11328,Lily,16," Well, I imagine it was pretty awful, so let's go.",2,How I Met Your Mother,50,10
11329,Barney,16, Pretty awful? Pretty awful?! It was a masterpiece of awful. It's genius how bad it is. I kind of wish you guys could see it.,2,How I Met Your Mother,125,25
11330,Lily,16," Yeah, well, anyway.",2,How I Met Your Mother,20,3
11331,Barney,16, Act two is where I really hit my stride. Spoiler alert,2,How I Met Your Mother,55,11
11332,Barney,16," It's your funeral. Five, six, one, two.",2,How I Met Your Mother,40,7
11333,Ted,16," So we stayed and let Barney torture us for another hour and a half, 'cause that's what friends do, apparently.",2,How I Met Your Mother,111,20
11335,Robin,16, Hey.,2,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
11336,Ted,16, Where've you been? I called you earlier.,2,How I Met Your Mother,41,7
11337,Robin,16, I gave my dogs away to my aunt.,2,How I Met Your Mother,32,8
11338,Ted,16, You what?,2,How I Met Your Mother,10,2
11339,Robin,16," Yeah. Just for a few months as a test run, but... I think it's for the best.",2,How I Met Your Mother,77,17
11340,Ted,16," Wow. Oh, man.",2,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
11341,Robin,16, Can we go inside?,2,How I Met Your Mother,18,4
11342,Ted,16," Uh, no. Uh, let's go to the bar.",2,How I Met Your Mother,33,8
11343,Robin,16, Why? What's going on inside?,2,How I Met Your Mother,29,5
11344,Ted,16," Um, the floors are gone.",2,How I Met Your Mother,25,5
11345,Robin,16, What?,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
11346,Ted,16," Yeah. I-I sent them out to get, um, fixed. This is a terrible lie. I'm just going to bail.",2,How I Met Your Mother,91,19
11348,Ted,16, I didn't know you were getting rid of the dogs!,2,How I Met Your Mother,48,10
11349,Robin,16, You said you threw all that stuff away!,2,How I Met Your Mother,40,8
11350,Ted,16," Kids, this was the worst fight Robin and I ever had. It was one of those fights that last for hours and you start to get woozy and lose track of what you're fighting about. We fought for so long, seasons changed outside the window. Pages of the calendar blew off. It was crazy. But, ultimately, and I couldn't tell you how for the life of me, but somehow we got to here.",2,How I Met Your Mother,371,73
11351,Robin,16, We're really doing this?,2,How I Met Your Mother,25,4
11352,Ted,16, Yeah.,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
11356,Barney,16," The robot found love Confusing my circuitry My software's been hacked Toaster oven You're the one for me Two, three, four.",2,How I Met Your Mother,123,21
11359,Ted,17, This is awesome.,2,How I Met Your Mother,17,3
11360,Marshall,17," I can't believe this moment's finally here. One more mile and my little boy turns 200,000.",2,How I Met Your Mother,91,16
11361,Ted,17," Your baby Fiero's grown into a really old man Fiero. And just like an old man, he leaks fluid, smells stale, makes weird noises out the back.",2,How I Met Your Mother,142,27
11362,Marshall,17," Yeah, he does. Hey, light up those cigars in the glove compartment. They're real Cubans. I got 'em in Chinatown last year just for this moment.",2,How I Met Your Mother,144,26
11363,Ted,17," Uh, Marshall, I'm not saying you were definitely ripped off, but these are chopsticks wrapped in napkins.",2,How I Met Your Mother,106,17
11365,Ted,17," Whoa, pothole. The car stops.",2,How I Met Your Mother,30,5
11366,Marshall,17," What? No. Oh. No. No, no, no. No, there's only.8 miles to go. Come on, buddy. Buddy!",2,How I Met Your Mother,85,17
11367,Ted,17, Is it cool if I still light these?,2,How I Met Your Mother,35,8
11369,Ted,17," Kids, sometimes life forces us to be someone we didn't want to be. When that happens, we often try to hold on to a little piece of who we were. Maybe a tattoo. Or a piece of jewelry. A tiny souvenir that reminds us, ""This is who I really am."" Marshall's souvenir was not so tiny, but the more he found himself being pushed toward the corporate world and away from his dream of saving the environment, the tighter he held on to that Fiero.",2,How I Met Your Mother,439,85
11371,Ted,17, Hey. One good thing,2,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
11372,Marshall,17, Hey. It's very important to both Lily and me that there be a handmade origami crane in each of our wedding's... I couldn't even get through it. Thank God.,2,How I Met Your Mother,155,29
11373,Ted,17," Hey, your car's going to be fine. This is the best auto shop around. Look at this certificate. One of the mechanics here finished a 64-ounce steak.",2,How I Met Your Mother,148,27
11375,Lily,17, Surprise.,2,How I Met Your Mother,10,1
11376,Robin,17," We felt bad that you guys were missing the super-fun origami folding party, so... we suggested moving it here.",2,How I Met Your Mother,111,19
11377,Barney,17, We insisted.,2,How I Met Your Mother,13,2
11378,Ted,17, Terrific.,2,How I Met Your Mother,10,1
11379,Barney,17, How's the Fiero?,2,How I Met Your Mother,17,3
11380,Marshall,17, She's still in triage.,2,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
11381,Ted,17, She? I thought it was your little boy.,2,How I Met Your Mother,39,8
11382,Lily,17," Oh, it goes back and forth. It's sort of a tranny car.",2,How I Met Your Mother,55,12
11383,Robin,17, How long have you had her... slash him?,2,How I Met Your Mother,40,8
11384,Marshall,17, My brothers handed it down to me when I was 16.,2,How I Met Your Mother,48,11
11385,Robin,17," Oh, how nice of them.",2,How I Met Your Mother,22,5
11386,Marshall,17, Not really.,2,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
11390,Marshall,17, Come on! I already shaved my legs and swallowed five dollars in quarters. Only $4.50 has come out.,2,How I Met Your Mother,99,18
11392,Marshall,17, That's it?,2,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
11394,Marshall,17, Agreed. Totally agreed.,2,How I Met Your Mother,24,3
11397,Marshall,17, I'm aware of that.,2,How I Met Your Mother,19,4
11399,Marshall,17," No... Look, can I just have my coffee, please?",2,How I Met Your Mother,47,9
11403,Ted,17," And that is the origin of Marshall's insane ""no food or drinks in the Fiero, not even groceries"" rule.",2,How I Met Your Mother,103,19
11404,Marshall,17, It is not insane.,2,How I Met Your Mother,18,4
11405,Lily,17, Barney. That's like the third one in a row that you've screwed up.,2,How I Met Your Mother,67,13
11406,Barney,17," Well, I'm trying, but it's...",2,How I Met Your Mother,30,5
11407,Lily,17," Look. You fold twice to the middle, fold back and forth, pull the ends out, flip over, open the flaps, fold the edges, crease the front, fold in half, fold the wings down, push in the bottom corners, and fold the wings back out. Or would you like one of my kindergartners to show you?",2,How I Met Your Mother,285,55
11408,Barney,17," Wait, wait, wait. Wait, I think I've got it.",2,How I Met Your Mother,45,9
11409,Lily,17, No. Forget it; the paper's too expensive. You're out.,2,How I Met Your Mother,54,9
11410,Barney,17," Aw, nerts.",2,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
11411,Ted,17, The food rule is insane. We could have died because of it. Remember the 100K fiasco?,2,How I Met Your Mother,85,16
11412,Marshall,17," Ah, the Fiero-asco.",2,How I Met Your Mother,20,3
11413,Ted,17," Dude, I told you that doesn't work. It's the 100K fiasco.",2,How I Met Your Mother,58,11
11414,Robin,17, What's the 100K fiasco?,2,How I Met Your Mother,24,4
11415,Marshall,17, The Fiero-asco?,2,How I Met Your Mother,16,2
11416,Ted,17," It was just before winter break our freshman year of college. Marshall and I were roommates, but we weren't really good friends yet.",2,How I Met Your Mother,133,23
11417,Marshall,17, I thought Ted was a little bit pretentious.,2,How I Met Your Mother,44,8
11418,Ted,17, And Marshall was a total slob.,2,How I Met Your Mother,31,6
11420,Marshall,17," Hey  I'm driving my Fiero back over break. I know we see enough of each other as it is, but if you want a ride, I could use the gas money. You live in Ohio, right? I could swing through and pick you up.",2,How I Met Your Mother,203,44
11421,Ted,17," All right, first of all, my parents live in Ohio. I live in the moment. Plus, Karen and I haven't seen each other since Thanksgiving. We're both really invested in making this long-distance thing work, so...",2,How I Met Your Mother,208,36
11422,Marshall,17," All right, well, call me if you change your mind. My odometer's going to hit 100K.",2,How I Met Your Mother,83,16
11423,Ted,17, She'd be so bummed if I left early.,2,How I Met Your Mother,36,8
11425,Ted,17," It was totally mutual. I mean, Karen brought it up first, but I... it was... it was totally mutual.",2,How I Met Your Mother,100,19
11426,Marshall,17, I hear you.,2,How I Met Your Mother,12,3
11427,Ted,17, So what's up with you and Lily? Anything serious,2,How I Met Your Mother,49,9
11428,Marshall,17," Yeah. Dude, we're college freshmen. I'm not going to get tied down by the first chick I hook up with. Lily's cool, but this bird you'll never chain, you know?",2,How I Met Your Mother,159,30
11429,Ted,17, The next few hours of our drive were classic road trip.,2,How I Met Your Mother,56,11
11430,Ted,17, So... this song.,2,How I Met Your Mother,17,3
11431,Marshall,17," Oh, it's the best song in the world. It's the only song I like. Just kidding. Tape's been stuck in the player for, like, two years. Better than nothing, though.",2,How I Met Your Mother,161,30
11432,Ted,17, Maybe. I am so... sick... of this song.,2,How I Met Your Mother,40,8
11433,Marshall,17, Don't worry. It comes around again.,2,How I Met Your Mother,36,6
11434,Ted,17, What do you mean?,2,How I Met Your Mother,18,4
11436,Marshall,17," Yeah, we totally nailed the ending.",2,How I Met Your Mother,36,6
11437,Ted,17," That was probably our best one. Hey, you want to play Zitch Dog?",2,How I Met Your Mother,65,13
11438,Marshall,17, What?,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
11439,Ted,17," Uh, it's a car game. Every time you see a dog, you got to be the first one to say, ""Zitch dog."" I'm pretty good, so...",2,How I Met Your Mother,119,26
11440,Marshall,17, Zitch dog.,2,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
11441,Ted,17," Well, no, I didn't know we had...we'd started, but... Okay, that's cool. You got the first point.",2,How I Met Your Mother,98,17
11442,Marshall,17, Zitch dog.,2,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
11443,Ted,17, Zitch dog. Damn it!,2,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
11444,Ted,17, Are we still playing? 'Cause I wasn't... I wasn't really...,2,How I Met Your Mother,60,10
11445,Marshall,17, 12-nothing.,2,How I Met Your Mother,12,1
11447,Ted,17, Marshall. Marshall.,2,How I Met Your Mother,20,2
11448,Marshall,17," Zitch dog, blue Suburban.",2,How I Met Your Mother,26,4
11449,Ted,17, Damn it!,2,How I Met Your Mother,9,2
11450,Marshall,17, 18-nothing.,2,How I Met Your Mother,12,1
11451,Ted,17," Then Marshall, who was so busy cheating at Zitch Dog, got us totally lost.",2,How I Met Your Mother,75,14
11452,Marshall,17, Where the hell are we?!,2,How I Met Your Mother,24,5
11454,Marshall,17," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. I think you skipped something.",2,How I Met Your Mother,70,12
11455,Barney,17, Really? Seems impossible.,2,How I Met Your Mother,26,3
11457,Ted,17," Hey, we got some time. What do you say we get off the highway, take the road less traveled, you know? Robert Frost.",2,How I Met Your Mother,116,23
11458,Marshall,17, Doesn't seem like a smart idea.,2,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
11459,Ted,17," Too late. I'm taking this exit. Who's not fun enough now, Karen?",2,How I Met Your Mother,65,12
11460,Marshall,17, Then we got lost. Where the hell are we?! I'm pulling over.,2,How I Met Your Mother,60,12
11461,Ted,17," No, keep driving.",2,How I Met Your Mother,18,3
11462,Marshall,17," We're almost out of gas, and we might not even be on a road anymore.",2,How I Met Your Mother,69,15
11463,Ted,17," It's below zero out. If we pull over, we could be snowed in for days. Plus, I only have, like, six granola bars and three bottles of water.",2,How I Met Your Mother,140,28
11464,Marshall,17," Nah, I threw them out.",2,How I Met Your Mother,23,5
11465,Ted,17, What?!,2,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
11466,Marshall,17, No food or drink in the Fiero.,2,How I Met Your Mother,31,7
11467,Ted,17, No food or drink in the F...? You haven't washed your sheets since... ,2,How I Met Your Mother,71,13
11468,Marshall,17, Pretty sure that my foot is frozen solid.,2,How I Met Your Mother,42,8
11469,Ted,17," Marshall... there's a very real chance that we're gonna be snowed in here for days. If I die first, do whatever you need to survive. Eat my flesh. Slice me open like a tauntaun, whatever.",2,How I Met Your Mother,188,35
11470,Marshall,17," Thanks, Ted. You're a good friend. And if I die first, you just leave my body alone.",2,How I Met Your Mother,85,17
11471,Ted,17, What? I just said you could cut me open and crawl inside me.,2,How I Met Your Mother,61,13
11472,Marshall,17," Yeah, don't do any of that stuff to me; it skeeves me out.",2,How I Met Your Mother,59,13
11473,Ted,17," But... but you're dead, and I'm gonna die if I don't.",2,How I Met Your Mother,54,11
11474,Marshall,17, Wasn't an easy decision.,2,How I Met Your Mother,25,4
11475,Ted,17, This is all because of your insane no-food rule.,2,How I Met Your Mother,49,9
11476,Marshall,17, It's perfectly rational.,2,How I Met Your Mother,25,3
11478,Ted,17," Hey! My spectacles! Hey. I know we're low on gas, but can we turn on the heat for just a minute?",2,How I Met Your Mother,97,21
11479,Marshall,17, Okay. Dude... I hate to say this... but it's so cold... there's only one way that we're gonna make it through this night. We should've kept driving.,2,How I Met Your Mother,149,27
11480,Ted,17," Come on, Marshall.",2,How I Met Your Mother,19,3
11481,Marshall,17," No. No. We might die now. I may never see Lily again. I never told anybody this, but... I've known for a long time that I'm gonna marry that girl. If we survive this, someday I'm gonna marry her. I'm sorry about your spectacles.",2,How I Met Your Mother,229,44
11482,Ted,17," That's okay. They were decorative. Hey, Marshall.",2,How I Met Your Mother,50,7
11483,Marshall,17, Yeah?,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
11484,Ted,17, Are you still thinking about Lily?,2,How I Met Your Mother,35,6
11485,Marshall,17, Yeah.,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
11486,Ted,17, Please stop. And so Marshall and I thought we were gonna die out there in the middle of nowhere. But funny thing...,2,How I Met Your Mother,116,22
11490,Marshall,17, Zitch dog!,2,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
11491,Ted,17, Damn it!,2,How I Met Your Mother,9,2
11493,Lily,17, You said you were gonna marry me that long ago? That is so sweet.,2,How I Met Your Mother,66,14
11494,Ted,17, That trip is when Marshall and I became best friends.,2,How I Met Your Mother,54,10
11495,Barney,17," With privileges, from the sound of it.",2,How I Met Your Mother,39,7
11497,Barney,17, Wow. Looks like he really needs a hug. Ted.,2,How I Met Your Mother,44,9
11498,Marshall,17," He said it would be at least 3,000 bucks to make it run again. And even then, there's no guarantee.",2,How I Met Your Mother,100,20
11499,Ted,17," Well, it's a pretty old car.",2,How I Met Your Mother,29,6
11500,Robin,17," Yeah. You can keep prolonging its life, but it's really mostly machine at this point.",2,How I Met Your Mother,86,15
11501,Marshall,17," I know that it's a lot of money, but it's my Fiero, you know? I'm about to graduate and take some sellout corporate law job, and without that Fiero, I'm just another guy in a suit.",2,How I Met Your Mother,181,36
11502,Barney,17, How dare you...,2,How I Met Your Mother,16,3
11504,Marshall,17, I've been through so much in that car. The suicidal cat.,2,How I Met Your Mother,57,11
11506,Marshall,17, Hitchhiking Waldo. The homeless guy who broke in through the window and threw up all over the backseat.,2,How I Met Your Mother,104,18
11507,Robin,17," Lily, don't. Be strong. Do not go all ""prisoner's dilemma"" on me.",2,How I Met Your Mother,66,12
11508,Lily,17," The car's on its deathbed, Robin. I have to clear my conscience.",2,How I Met Your Mother,65,12
11509,Marshall,17," Guys, what are you talking about?",2,How I Met Your Mother,34,6
11510,Lily,17," Okay. Shortly after we met Robin, she and I were jonesing for Thai food from this one place.",2,How I Met Your Mother,93,18
11512,Robin,17, An hour and a half delivery. We can't wait that long.,2,How I Met Your Mother,54,11
11513,Lily,17," I wish we could take the Fiero, but Marshall has this insane no-food rule.",2,How I Met Your Mother,75,14
11514,Robin,17," But Thai food, Lily. Pad Yum Mao. Tom Kai Gah. Thai See Ran.",2,How I Met Your Mother,61,13
11515,Lily,17," Oh! You're just saying random syllables, and it still sounds delicious. Okay. Here's what we'll do. We'll drive over, pick it up, have them double-bag it, very carefully drive it back here with the windows open, and he'll never know. . Wow, these brakes are really sensitive. Oh, Marshall is gonna kill me! This and the difference between ""affect"" and ""effect"" are the only two things he's really serious about.",2,How I Met Your Mother,412,70
11516,Robin,17," Lily, it's gonna be fine.",2,How I Met Your Mother,26,5
11517,Lily,17," No, it's not. Marshall's gonna freak. Oh, God, oh, God. What are we gonna do? Oh, God, oh...!",2,How I Met Your Mother,94,18
11518,Robin,17," Shut up! Now, listen to me. The clock is ticking. Okay, first thing, we scoop up all these little pieces of tofu and cabbage. Next, what we need to take care of are the really messy parts-- the pools that have collected. We got to soak that soup up. Last is the smell. We got to cover up that Tom Kah Gai. You mentioned cigars.",2,How I Met Your Mother,328,65
11519,Lily,17," There's two in the glove compartment, but he's been saving them.",2,How I Met Your Mother,65,11
11520,Robin,17," Hand me those chopsticks. Hey, how about some tunes? Oh, great song.",2,How I Met Your Mother,69,12
11521,Lily,17, These cigars aren't helping at all.,2,How I Met Your Mother,36,6
11522,Robin,17, Yeah. This was a terrible idea.,2,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
11523,Lily,17, Now it just smells like a homeless guy threw up in here. End of flasback.,2,How I Met Your Mother,74,15
11524,Marshall,17, The broken windows?,2,How I Met Your Mother,20,3
11525,Lily,17, We had to make it look realistic.,2,How I Met Your Mother,34,7
11526,Marshall,17, Why did you break two of them?,2,How I Met Your Mother,31,7
11527,Robin,17, It looked like fun when she did it. So I wanted to try.,2,How I Met Your Mother,56,13
11528,Marshall,17, Can't believe this whole time it was you guys. I've been blaming really tanned dancing leotard guy.,2,How I Met Your Mother,100,17
11529,Lily,17," Marshall, I'm so sorry, but sharing that secret-- that's when Robin and I became best friends.",2,How I Met Your Mother,95,16
11531,Marshall,17, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.,2,How I Met Your Mother,42,9
11532,Barney,17," Come on, Marshall. This is your Fiero. You know the rightthing to do here.",2,How I Met Your Mother,75,14
11533,Robin,17," Wow, Barney, why do you love that car so much?",2,How I Met Your Mother,47,10
11534,Barney,17, Love it? Hold on a second. Love it? I hate it!,2,How I Met Your Mother,47,11
11535,Lily,17, What? Why?,2,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
11536,Barney,17, Why? Why? Why?! Why?!,2,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
11537,Ted,17, Let me tell it. It was last year during the transit strike.,2,How I Met Your Mother,60,12
11539,Ted,17, Hey.,2,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
11540,Barney,17," Hey. Uh, is Marshall around? I have a massage in Queens in half an hour. I need a ride.",2,How I Met Your Mother,88,19
11541,Ted,17," Uh, no, he's at the library all day. Just take the keys.",2,How I Met Your Mother,57,12
11542,Barney,17, Hey! Why don't you drive me? It'll be like a total road trip.,2,How I Met Your Mother,62,13
11543,Ted,17, To Queens?,2,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
11544,Barney,17," Yeah, we'll get, we'll get beef jerky, Triscuits.",2,How I Met Your Mother,50,8
11545,Ted,17,"Uh, actually I have a lot of work to do, so.",2,How I Met Your Mother,44,11
11546,Barney,17," Okay. Well, anyway, I'll cancel. See you later.",2,How I Met Your Mother,48,8
11547,Ted,17," Wait! You know how to drive, right?",2,How I Met Your Mother,36,7
11548,Barney,17," What, of course I know how to drive. I love driving. Hitting the road. Cruising the lanes. And braking. Honking. Love it. Except for lady drivers. Don't get me started on lady drivers.",2,How I Met Your Mother,185,33
11549,Ted,17, Which pedal's the gas?,2,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
11550,Barney,17, Trick question.,2,How I Met Your Mother,16,2
11551,Ted,17," No, it's not",2,How I Met Your Mother,13,3
11552,Barney,17," Yes, it is.",2,How I Met Your Mother,12,3
11553,Ted,17," No, it's not.",2,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
11554,Barney,17," Middle, left, right? I never learned how to drive! I grew up in the city. I never had a chance.",2,How I Met Your Mother,96,20
11555,Ted,17," Well, guess what? You're getting your chance. Because I'm going to teach you. Barney Stinson, buckle up.",2,How I Met Your Mother,105,17
11557,Barney,17, This isn't right. God never meant for us to travel at such breakneck speeds.,2,How I Met Your Mother,77,14
11558,Ted,17, Relax. You're doing great. Ignore the old lady on the rascal; this isn't a race.,2,How I Met Your Mother,81,15
11559,Barney,17," Dude, a dog.",2,How I Met Your Mother,13,3
11560,Ted,17," Zitch dogs, this. Or nothing.",2,How I Met Your Mother,30,5
11561,Barney,17," What do I do? Tell me what to do, Ted.",2,How I Met Your Mother,39,10
11562,Ted,17, Step on the brakes. Sometime in the next 20 minutes.,2,How I Met Your Mother,53,10
11563,Barney,17, Which? Which one's the break again?,2,How I Met Your Mother,36,6
11564,Ted,17, The left one.,2,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
11565,Barney,17," Left. Oh, man, left. I'm totally blanking.",2,How I Met Your Mother,43,7
11566,Ted,17, Make the Ls,2,How I Met Your Mother,12,3
11568,Ted,17, Why did you just turn on the radio?,2,How I Met Your Mother,36,8
11569,Barney,17," I don't know why I turned on the radio! We're going to die. Tell me what to do, Ted.",2,How I Met Your Mother,85,19
11570,Ted,17, Relax. You're being crazy.,2,How I Met Your Mother,27,4
11571,Barney,17," Help me, Ted! I'm being serious.",2,How I Met Your Mother,33,6
11572,Ted,17," Stop, drop and roll. Screaming is fun! Screaming is fun!",2,How I Met Your Mother,57,10
11573,Barney,17, I can't move. I can't... I can't feel my... Wait. Wait. We're okay.,2,How I Met Your Mother,68,13
11574,Ted,17, We're okay.,2,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
11575,Barney,17," We're okay. It's a miracle, Ted!",2,How I Met Your Mother,33,6
11577,Robin,17, Wow. Sounds like you had some accident in that car.,2,How I Met Your Mother,52,10
11578,Ted,17," Actually, he had two accidents if you add the fact that he...",2,How I Met Your Mother,62,12
11579,Barney,17," ummina-hummina-hummina-hummina ummina-hummina-hummina hummina. I shouldn't even be here, thanks to that deathtrap. But fate... fate gave me a second chance. And helped me realize that our days on this planet are too few to squander. So I decided from that moment on to continue living life to its fullest.",2,How I Met Your Mother,306,49
11580,Lily,17, So you made a life-changing decision to not change your life at all.,2,How I Met Your Mother,69,13
11581,Barney,17, True story.,2,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
11582,Marshall,17, Guys. This Fiero's meant a lot to all of us. Friendships were made. Adventures had. Horrors faced. That's why we have to get rid of it.,2,How I Met Your Mother,136,26
11583,Barney,17, Yes!,2,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
11585,Marshall,17, It's lived a great life and it deserves to die with dignity.Ted,2,How I Met Your Mother,64,12
11586,Marshall,17," But that's life. You know? You never end up where you thought you wanted to be. I'm not helping the environment. Ted's not a philosopher. Lily's not not a world-famous artist. Barney's never driven more than ten miles an hour. Robin, I'm sure, has also experience disappointment in her life. Maybe? And my Fiero's not a Fiero that went 200,000 miles. It's okay. You know? Those are old dreams. We'll get a new car and we'll fill that one up with new memories. And that'll be the car we had when we were first married. When we owned our first house. Maybe even the first car our four kids remember.",2,How I Met Your Mother,598,110
11587,Lily,17, That's so sweet. The first car our two kids remember.,2,How I Met Your Mother,54,10
11588,Marshall,17, I would like to say good-bye. Marshall is in the car and the other are around it. Marshall taps the dashboard and the cassette goes out.,2,How I Met Your Mother,137,26
11589,Ted,17," You know what? This Fiero, it's effected all our lives.",2,How I Met Your Mother,56,10
11590,Marshall,17, Affected.,2,How I Met Your Mother,10,1
11591,Ted,17, That's what I said.,2,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
11592,Marshall,17," Just making sure. Got us all a lot of places. I mean maybe it's time we return the favor. This Fiero should have made it to 200,000. So, let's get it out that door. And we'll push it the last.7 miles. It'd do the same for us. Marshall puts the cassette back in and they all start to push.",2,How I Met Your Mother,289,59
11594,Marshall,17, Close enough!,2,How I Met Your Mother,14,2
11596,Ted,17," And so Marshall said good-bye to his Fiero. And as the car's final gift to us all, the money he got for scrap parts paid our bar tab for the next two nights.",2,How I Met Your Mother,158,33

12413,Lily,20, I'll come with you. No. I'll stay.,2,How I Met Your Mother,35,7
12416,Lily,20," Okay, I know. You know? I got to go. Good-bye. My mom's driving me cra....",2,How I Met Your Mother,75,15
12418,Ted,20, Long story. I'll tell you later.,2,How I Met Your Mother,33,6

12422,Barney,20, So you and Lily really think you can spend two weeks apart?,2,How I Met Your Mother,60,12
12423,Marshall,20," You know what, Barney? Lily and I are a lot less chees than you make us out to be.",2,How I Met Your Mother,83,19
12424,Lily,20," Marshmallow, don't forget to pack my night-night tape.",2,How I Met Your Mother,55,8
12425,Barney,20," Night-night tape? Did you make a tape of you saying ""night-night"" to her?",2,How I Met Your Mother,74,13

12441,Marshall,20, No way!,2,How I Met Your Mother,8,2

12445,Robin,20," Barney, I didn't know you were such a fan of The Price is Right.",2,How I Met Your Mother,65,14
12446,Barney,20," Are you kidding? T.P.I.R. is not just an indescribably entertaining hour of television, it's a microcosm of our entire economic system-- a capitalist utopia, where consumers are rewarded for their persistence, market acumen and intrepid spirit. I gaze upon the glory of The Price Is Right, and I see the face of America. And it is divine. Plus, you know, hot chicks on sports cars.",2,How I Met Your Mother,382,65
12447,Ted,20, Then Lily headed out to Robin's for her first night away from Marshall.,2,How I Met Your Mother,72,13

12453,Ted,20," Here goes. Hello, everyone, I'm Ted Mosby, Marshall's best man. Strong opening, right?",2,How I Met Your Mother,87,13
12454,Marshall,20, That's fantastic.,2,How I Met Your Mother,18,2
12455,Ted,20," When Marshall graduates this spring, he'll be a lawyer. But did you know that Marshall has a criminal record? That's right, on a road trip up to Cape Cod, Marshall was pulled over for driving by himself in a car pool lane.",2,How I Met Your Mother,223,42
12457,Marshall,20," Oh, crap.",2,How I Met Your Mother,10,2
12459,Lily,20," Oh, crap.",2,How I Met Your Mother,10,2

12462,Ted,20, That grandpa died three years ago.,2,How I Met Your Mother,35,6

12465,Barney,20," So which one, ""A"" or ""B""?",2,How I Met Your Mother,26,6
12466,Marshall,20, What was that?,2,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
12467,Barney,20," I have to decide how to run to contestant's row when they say, ""Barney Stinson, come on down!""",2,How I Met Your Mother,95,18
12468,Ted,20," Oh, I didn't realize that's what it was. Can you do them again?",2,How I Met Your Mother,64,13
12469,Barney,20," Yeah, of course.",2,How I Met Your Mother,17,3
12471,Barney,20," Hey! Very funny. Just for that, when I win all the prizes, the only thing you guys are getting is Rice-A-Roni and Turtle Wax.",2,How I Met Your Mother,126,24
12473,Lily,20," It's $300 just to take the bust in? Oh, please, you have to have some sympathy for me. I'm getting married next Saturday, and I'm too skinny for my dress. I lost all this weight without even trying. Hello?",2,How I Met Your Mother,206,39
12474,Robin,20, What happened?,2,How I Met Your Mother,15,2
12475,Lily,20," She called me a bitch and hung up. Oh, I don't know what to do. I guess I'll just have to pay the $300.",2,How I Met Your Mother,104,24
12476,Robin,20," Pay the $300? Lily, are you crazy? This isn't a problem. It's a license to eat. Look, what have you always wanted to eat but didn't because it was too ridicuusly decadent?",2,How I Met Your Mother,172,32
12477,Lily,20," Ooh, a Valrhona chocolate soufflí©e with a raspberry brandy sauce topped with caramelized bananas and hazelnut gelato.",2,How I Met Your Mother,119,17
12478,Robin,20, I have Cool Whip and half a bag of Fritos.,2,How I Met Your Mother,43,10
12479,Lily,20, Done!,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
12481,Ted,20," Okay, think you're gonna be happy with my new toast. There's nothing sexual. It's, uh, it's just the story of an important moment in your relationship.",2,How I Met Your Mother,152,26
12482,Marshall,20," I'm all ears. Hello, everyone,",2,How I Met Your Mother,31,5
12483,Ted,20," I'm Ted Mosby, Marshall's best man.",2,How I Met Your Mother,36,6
12484,Marshall,20, Nice.,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
12485,Ted,20, Right? That's great. Back when we were all freshman and Marshall and Lily were just a few short weeks into their relationship... It was 4,2,How I Met Your Mother,138,25
12487,Marshall,20, I love you.,2,How I Met Your Mother,12,3

12489,Marshall,20, Yeah. Ted leaves the room.,2,How I Met Your Mother,27,5
12491,Marshall,20, So here's what you want to talk about in front of my entire family,2,How I Met Your Mother,67,14
12492,Ted,20," Dude, you're almost 30. Your mom would be mad at you for eating junk food?",2,How I Met Your Mother,75,15
12493,Marshall,20," Yeah, Ted, 'cause nutrition's not important. Also, so Lily's never heard that story before. How's she going to react when she finds out the first time I said ""I love you"" to her, I was actually saying it to you and a bag of Funyuns",2,How I Met Your Mother,232,45
12494,Ted,20," But who cares? You did love her. And you still do. And you're totally over Funyuns, so it's not weird.",2,How I Met Your Mother,103,20
12496,Marshall,20," Hey, Lil.",2,How I Met Your Mother,10,2
12497,Lily,20, Hey.,2,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
12498,Ted,20, Hey? That's it?,2,How I Met Your Mother,16,3
12499,Marshall,20, What are you talking about?,2,How I Met Your Mother,28,5
12500,Ted,20," Well, you guys have been spending the last few nights apart. I figured there'd be a lot of giggling, crying, jumping up and down, and then whatever Lily would do",2,How I Met Your Mother,162,30
12501,Ted,20," Now, one thing I remember about the bar menu at McClaren's is that there were no fewer than 11 different deep-fried appetizers. That night, Aunt Lily ordered them all.",2,How I Met Your Mother,168,29
12503,Barney,20," Check it out. Okay, imagine... imagine, if you will, that this is the $1 space on The Price Is Right wheel. Ready? ",2,How I Met Your Mother,116,22
12504,Marshall,20," Oh, wow, that was pretty close.",2,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
12505,Barney,20," Close? Close?! It's called The Price Is Right, not The Price Is Close! Oh, man, this is bad. If I don't win the spin-off, and I can't get into the Showcase Showdown, everything's ruined! It's all ruined!",2,How I Met Your Mother,204,37
12506,Ted,20," What is ruined? Why, why is this such a big deal?",2,How I Met Your Mother,50,11
12507,Barney,20," Okay, guys... sit down, I've got to tell you something. The reason I'm going on The Price Is Right is because I've decided that it's time for me to meet my real father.",2,How I Met Your Mother,169,33
12508,Ted,20, Your father?,2,How I Met Your Mother,13,2
12509,Barney,20, That's right. My father... is Bob Barker.,2,How I Met Your Mother,42,7
12510,Ted,20, Your dad... is Bob Barker?,2,How I Met Your Mother,27,5
12511,Barney,20, That's right,2,How I Met Your Mother,13,2
12512,Lily,20," The host of The Price Is Right, Bob Barker?",2,How I Met Your Mother,44,9
12513,Barney,20, That's Pops.,2,How I Met Your Mother,13,2
12514,Robin,20, Barney?,2,How I Met Your Mother,8,1
12516,Robin,20, Why in the world do you think Bob Barker is your father?,2,How I Met Your Mother,57,12
12517,Barney,20," Uh, because my mother told me he was, that's why.",2,How I Met Your Mother,50,10
12519,Barney,20," Mom, who's my dad? All the other kids at school know who their dad is. Who's mine?",2,How I Met Your Mother,83,17
12521,Barney,20,"Look, Dad, I got straight A's!",2,How I Met Your Mother,30,6
12523,Barney,20," Want to play some catch, Pop?",2,How I Met Your Mother,30,6
12525,Barney,20," So now I'm gonna go to L.A., be on the show, win the Showcase Showdown, make him proud of me, and then tell him who I am.",2,How I Met Your Mother,122,27
12526,Ted,20, You're gonna tell Bob Barker that you're his son on national television?,2,How I Met Your Mother,73,12
12527,Barney,20, Why is this so hard for you people to believe?,2,How I Met Your Mother,47,10
12528,Robin,20," Drop the popper! Lily has to gain five pounds in a week and a half, and it is my job to help her get there.",2,How I Met Your Mother,108,25
12529,Lily,20, This is the best wedding diet ever.,2,How I Met Your Mother,36,7
12532,Lily,20, I lost a pound.,2,How I Met Your Mother,16,4
12533,Robin,20, That is impossible. You ate McDonald's every meal for three days.,2,How I Met Your Mother,66,11
12534,Lily,20, I knew that Super Size Me guy was full of it.,2,How I Met Your Mother,46,11
12535,Robin,20," Well, it must be the wedding stress. We just got to up the intake. Lily Aldrin, drop and give me 20 bites of fudge! Okay? Don't nibble at it. Attack it! Come on, Lily. You can do better than that!",2,How I Met Your Mother,197,40
12536,Lily,20, I can't.,2,How I Met Your Mother,9,2
12537,Robin,20," Well, eat faster, before your body figures out it's full.",2,How I Met Your Mother,58,10
12538,Lily,20, I'm trying.,2,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
12539,Robin,20," Oh, are you gonna cry? You gonna cry? Skinny little baby's gonna cry? Well, eat, damn it, eat!",2,How I Met Your Mother,95,18
12540,Lily,20, Okay!,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
12542,Ted,20," Hey, so I think I figured out how to do your toast in a completely appropriate way.",2,How I Met Your Mother,84,17
12543,Marshall,20, Finally.,2,How I Met Your Mother,9,1
12544,Ted,20," Yeah. Good evening. I'm Ted Mosby, Marshall's best man.",2,How I Met Your Mother,56,9
12545,Marshall,20," Still strong, right?",2,How I Met Your Mother,21,3
12546,Ted,20," Great, yeah. I'd like to share with you all a story about the momentous evening last fall",2,How I Met Your Mother,90,17
12548,Ted,20," when Marshall and Lily got back together. Afterward, we stayed up till 10",2,How I Met Your Mother,74,13
12549,Ted,20," Man, I'm well nourished right now!",2,How I Met Your Mother,35,6
12550,Barney,20, Calcium promotes healthy teeth and bones.,2,How I Met Your Mother,42,6
12551,Robin,20," Thanks, Marshall, for teaching us you don't need alcohol to have fun.",2,How I Met Your Mother,70,12
12552,Marshall,20," Oh, don't thank me. Thank my parents for teaching me good values.",2,How I Met Your Mother,66,12
12553,Ted,20," Now, I wasn't supposed to hear this next part, but Marshall leaned over to Lily and whispered.",2,How I Met Your Mother,95,17
12554,Marshall,20, You know what I'd like to do to you right now? I'd like to hold your hand. I'd like to hold your hand so hard that you're not able to shake hands for a week.,2,How I Met Your Mother,158,35
12555,Lily,20, Are you just going to talk about holding my hand or are you going to hold it?,2,How I Met Your Mother,78,17
12557,Ted,20," Then a little later, Robin caught them... Oh, um......holding hands. End flashback. It was a lovely and responsible night. To Marshall and Lily.",2,How I Met Your Mother,145,23
12558,Marshall,20," That's the worst toast I've ever heard, dude. It's totally boring.",2,How I Met Your Mother,67,11
12559,Ted,20," Exactly. It's impossible to write a good toast with you censoring me, man. I give up. I'm just going to read that thing about Jesus and the footprints.",2,How I Met Your Mother,152,28
12560,Lily,20," I give up, too. I don't care if my dress doesn't fit. I can't eat anymore. I-I feel like my stomach's going to explode.",2,How I Met Your Mother,120,24
12561,Marshall,20, I know.,2,How I Met Your Mother,8,2
12563,Ted,20," And so, Lily and I were both about to give up, but as you can all see, Lily does look beautiful in that dress, and here I am giving a toast. You know, all this time, I'd been wracking my brain trying to pick out the perfect moment to capture Lily and Marshall as a couple. But then I realized the perfect moment wasn't some needle lost in the haystack of their ten years together. The perfect Lily and Marshall moment happened two nights ago.",2,How I Met Your Mother,443,85
12565,Ted,20," Marshall, what are you doing?",2,How I Met Your Mother,30,5
12566,Marshall,20, Going to the bathroom.,2,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
12567,Ted,20, In the hall?,2,How I Met Your Mother,13,3
12568,Marshall,20, Sleepwalking?,2,How I Met Your Mother,14,1
12569,Ted,20, You're wide awake.,2,How I Met Your Mother,19,3
12570,Marshall,20, Robbing us?,2,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
12571,Ted,20, Dude.,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
12572,Ted,20," Turns out, all week long he'd been sneaking out to a hotel on 72nd, to meet Lily.",2,How I Met Your Mother,82,17
12574,Lily,20," God, I missed you.",2,How I Met Your Mother,19,4
12575,Marshall,20," I can't sleep without you. Hey, baby? Would you be the big spoon for a while?",2,How I Met Your Mother,78,16
12576,Lily,20," Sure, baby.",2,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
12577,Marshall,20, How's the weight gaining going?,2,How I Met Your Mother,32,5
12578,Lily,20," Ugh, terribly. I'm too stressed out without you around.",2,How I Met Your Mother,56,9
12579,Marshall,20," Well, I'm here now.",2,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
12580,Ted,20," And so Lily and Marshall failed in their experiment with apartness, but they succeeded in getting Lily into her dress. You know, there really are a million things I could tell you about Lily and Marshall, but really, the only thing you need to know is that ten years into their relationship, they still couldn't spend a single night apart. May they never have to again. To Lily and Marshall.",2,How I Met Your Mother,392,70
12582,Ted,20," Now, kids, the story of Lily and Marshall's wedding is a good one. No matter how perfectly you plan your... You know, wait a second, guys. I'll get to that. First, I've got to tell you what happened with Barney.",2,How I Met Your Mother,212,40
12586,Barney,20," Nooo. Oh, my God!",2,How I Met Your Mother,18,4
12591,Barney,20," Thanks, Da... Bob.",2,How I Met Your Mother,19,3

12602,Barney,20," Thank you, Bob.",2,How I Met Your Mother,16,3
12604,Barney,20, $1 billion.,2,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
12606,Barney,20," So, I brought some photos that I thought you might like to see. This is me on my first birthday.",2,How I Met Your Mother,97,20
12611,Barney,20," No, no, I want you to see this. This is great.",2,How I Met Your Mother,47,11
12615,Barney,20,$999.00 ,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1

12621,Barney,20," Did you just... I'm ready, Bob.",2,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
12626,Barney,20," Thank you, would you, would you say you're proud of me?",2,How I Met Your Mother,56,11

12644,Barney,20," Before, before we wrap up the show, there's just something I want to say to you.... Congratulations on 35 wonderful years hosting The Price Is Right.",2,How I Met Your Mother,150,26
12646,Barney,20, Have your pets spayed or neutered.,2,How I Met Your Mother,35,6
12647,Ted,20, Why didn't you tell him?,2,How I Met Your Mother,25,5
12648,Barney,20," Well, it's just... If you lived your whole life thinking one thing, it would be pretty devastating to find out that wasn't true. I just don't think Bob could have handled it.",2,How I Met Your Mother,175,32
12649,Ted,20, Bob. Yeah. Probably a good choice.,2,How I Met Your Mother,35,6
12650,Barney,20," Anyway, on the bright side. Happy wedding again!",2,How I Met Your Mother,49,8
12651,Ted,20, And that's the story of how Uncle Barney gave Lily and Marshall a dune buggy for their wedding.,2,How I Met Your Mother,96,18
12653,Marshall,20," Um, I thought since we're going to be apart for two whole weeks, I would sing you your night-night song. Night-night, Lily Night-night, Lily It's time to go to bed, oh, my silly, little Lily Time to rest your little head Sha-la-la-la-la Sha-la-la-la-la Come on, Ted.",2,How I Met Your Mother,267,46
12654,Ted,20," No, it's weird.",2,How I Met Your Mother,16,3
12655,Marshall,20, You promised.,2,How I Met Your Mother,14,2
12656,Ted,21," In May of 2007, Aunt Lily and Uncle Marshall got married at the historic Van Smoot House in upstate New York.",2,How I Met Your Mother,110,21
12658,Robin,21," Wow, it's beautiful, Lily.",2,How I Met Your Mother,27,4
12659,Lily,21, Yeah. It's just how I always pictured it.,2,How I Met Your Mother,42,8
12662,Lily,21," So, we've decided on a small, outdoor wedding, just family and close friends. No more than 25 people in a beautiful garden somewhere, maybe an acoustic guitar playing while we walk down the aisle.",2,How I Met Your Mother,197,34
12663,Barney,21, And maybe you already know someone who went down to the courthouse and registered as an officiant so that he or she-- he-- could perform the ceremony.,2,How I Met Your Mother,151,27
12664,Robin,21, But you hate marriage. Why do you want to perform the ceremony?,2,How I Met Your Mother,64,12
12665,Barney,21," Because it subtly implants in the mind of every woman there that when I ask a question, you say, ""I do."" Yeah.",2,How I Met Your Mother,111,22
12666,Ted,21," The closer you get to the big day, the more concessions you make.",2,How I Met Your Mother,66,13
12668,Lily,21, Great. Now my mom's making me invite the Lessners. This puts our numbers in the triple digits.,2,How I Met Your Mother,95,17
12669,Robin,21," Wow. I guess sometimes, Lessner is more... ner. You know how like sometimes less is more.",2,How I Met Your Mother,90,16
12670,Ted,21," Yeah. This is one of those times, sweetie?",2,How I Met Your Mother,43,8
12671,Marshall,21, You know what? That's okay. It'll be a slightly big outdoor wedding.,2,How I Met Your Mother,69,12
12673,Lily,21," So it's not going to be an outdoor wedding anymore. Marshall's dad is convinced if we have an outdoor wedding in New York, he's going to get mugged, so it's going to be inside now. It'll be great. We're still going to have our acoustic guitar player.",2,How I Met Your Mother,251,47
12675,Lily,21," So now, instead of an acoustic guitar, we're having a harp player. Yeah. My dad owes a guy, and... that guy's daughter plays the harp.",2,How I Met Your Mother,135,25
12676,Barney,21," Is she hot? I'd love to be able to cross ""harp player"" off my list.",2,How I Met Your Mother,68,15
12677,Marshall,21, How long is this list?,2,How I Met Your Mother,23,5
12678,Barney,21," Dude, I'm not gonna count how many pages the list is. I'm not crass.",2,How I Met Your Mother,69,14
12679,Lily,21," Well, it doesn't matter anyway. She's pregnant.",2,How I Met Your Mother,48,7
12680,Barney,21, Sweet! I can cross off two things.,2,How I Met Your Mother,35,7
12682,Ted,21, And the day arrives for Lily and Marshall's very big indoor wedding... with a harp.,2,How I Met Your Mother,84,15
12685,Lily,21, Wow. Andrea. You really are pregnant.,2,How I Met Your Mother,38,6
12687,Robin,21, How do you play the harp with your belly so...?,2,How I Met Your Mother,48,10
12689,Robin,21, You only play half the harp?,2,How I Met Your Mother,29,6
12691,Robin,21," Oh, no. Uh, okay. Lily, I will take care of this. Um, I'll just pluck the other half. Is it hard to learn?",2,How I Met Your Mother,107,23
12693,Robin,21," Yeah, but I'm a fast learner. You ever hear of ""Guitar Hero""? Learned that in a day. Is there a ""Harp Hero""?",2,How I Met Your Mother,109,22
12694,Lily,21," Robin, it's fine. So, so, when are you due?",2,How I Met Your Mother,44,9
12696,Lily,21," Wow, that's soon.",2,How I Met Your Mother,18,3
12699,Robin,21," Holy crap, we have to fire her. She's gonna drop a shorty in the middle of your ceremony.",2,How I Met Your Mother,90,18
12700,Lily,21," Robin, I'm not going to freak myself out. I hate those women who say, ""Oh, my wedding has to be perfect."" Things go wrong. Sometimes the deejay screws up your playlist. Sometimes you slip on placenta during the recessional.",2,How I Met Your Mother,224,39
12702,Barney,21, Can I grab a scotch and soda real quick?,2,How I Met Your Mother,41,9
12704,Barney,21," Wow. You just cost yourself a big tip, buddy.",2,How I Met Your Mother,46,9
12706,Barney,21," You allowed to accept criticism? You, sir, are an ass... buddy.",2,How I Met Your Mother,64,11
12708,Barney,21," Hey, you want to know what line doesn't work on a harp player? ""Hey, baby, want to pluck?""",2,How I Met Your Mother,91,18
12709,Robin,21, Really? That didn't work.,2,How I Met Your Mother,26,4
12710,Barney,21, Not even a little. Hey! Who's Bill?,2,How I Met Your Mother,36,7
12711,Lily,21, Bill?,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
12712,Barney,21, Yeah. This guy came up to me at the bar.,2,How I Met Your Mother,41,10
12715,Barney,21, Uh... Don't think they do that anymore.,2,How I Met Your Mother,40,7
12718,Lily,21," Oh, no. Did he look like a guy who tried to be an umpire but failed?",2,How I Met Your Mother,69,16
12719,Barney,21, He kind of did.,2,How I Met Your Mother,16,4
12720,Lily,21, That's Scooter.,2,How I Met Your Mother,16,2
12721,Robin,21," Your high school boyfriend, Scooter?",2,How I Met Your Mother,37,5
12722,Lily,21, His real name is Bill. My mom must have invited him.,2,How I Met Your Mother,53,11
12723,Robin,21, Why? Why would she do that?,2,How I Met Your Mother,28,6
12724,Lily,21," Our families are really close. But my ex-boyfriend? Come on, Mom. I didn't invite that professional squash player Dad busted you with. Oh, I need a glass of wine.",2,How I Met Your Mother,163,29
12725,Barney,21, I'll get it.,2,How I Met Your Mother,13,3
12726,Lily,21," Oh, thanks. Hey, how's Marshall doing?",2,How I Met Your Mother,39,6
12727,Barney,21, He's great. He's about to get his hair cut.,2,How I Met Your Mother,44,9
12728,Lily,21, Oh. I'm worried my cousin's going to cut it too short.,2,How I Met Your Mother,55,11
12729,Barney,21," Me, too. I was up all night.",2,How I Met Your Mother,29,7
12732,Barney,21," Hey, Bill.",2,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
12734,Lily,21," Scooter, what are you doing here?",2,How I Met Your Mother,34,6
12736,Lily,21," You're really cute. Oh, no. Really?",2,How I Met Your Mother,36,6
12738,Lily,21, I want... I want... Scooter!,2,How I Met Your Mother,29,5
12740,Barney,21, I need a glass of wine.,2,How I Met Your Mother,24,6
12742,Barney,21," It's for the bride, so...",2,How I Met Your Mother,26,5
12744,Barney,21," White. And, uh... she'd also like a scotch and soda.",2,How I Met Your Mother,53,10
12746,Barney,21, She'd also like a bowl of smoked almonds.,2,How I Met Your Mother,42,8
12748,Barney,21," Well, it's only the biggest day of her life, so...The barman leaves... Let the games begin.",2,How I Met Your Mother,92,16
12750,Barney,21, Here. Can't stay. Got to try something.,2,How I Met Your Mother,40,7
12752,Robin,21, That is a good song.,2,How I Met Your Mother,21,5
12756,Robin,21, That's Scooter.,2,How I Met Your Mother,16,2
12759,Barney,21, Hey.,2,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
12761,Barney,21, Can I have your phone number?,2,How I Met Your Mother,30,6
12763,Barney,21, It's for the bride.,2,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
12765,Barney,21, The bride wants you to walk slower.,2,How I Met Your Mother,36,7
12767,Robin,21," Oh, wow.",2,How I Met Your Mother,9,2
12768,Lily,21," Oh. Robin... My makeup looks perfect right now, and I'm about to cry. Do something.",2,How I Met Your Mother,84,15
12769,Robin,21, I have hairy nipples.,2,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
12770,Lily,21, Really?,2,How I Met Your Mother,8,1
12771,Robin,21," No, but it worked, didn't it?",2,How I Met Your Mother,30,6
12773,Robin,21," There's a photographer? Oh, my God. Okay, I just have to call...",2,How I Met Your Mother,65,12
12774,Lily,21," Robin, stop. Stop. It's okay. I am not gonna let anything get to me today.",2,How I Met Your Mother,75,15
12777,Lily,21, I'm okay.,2,How I Met Your Mother,10,2
12780,Lily,21, I'm fine.,2,How I Met Your Mother,10,2
12783,Lily,21, Totally cool.,2,How I Met Your Mother,14,2
12784,Robin,21," Oh, no. Lily, I think I forgot your bridal panties. I-I thought I had them. I'm so sorry.",2,How I Met Your Mother,90,18
12785,Lily,21," Oh, it's okay, I'll just wear the ones I have on.",2,How I Met Your Mother,50,11
12786,Robin,21, Are you sure?,2,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
12787,Lily,21," I'm marrying Marshall today. So it doesn't even matter that I'm gonna walk down the aisle without a veil in a room that has no flowers to the music of half a harp played by a woman who's crowning, as my high school boyfriend reads Guns N' Roses lyrics. But that's okay, because there's no photographer there to take any pictures of it anyway.",2,How I Met Your Mother,343,64
12788,Robin,21," Lily, are you okay?",2,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
12789,Lily,21, What do you think?! Of course I'm not okay! Everything that could possibly go wrong at my wedding has! It's ruined!,2,How I Met Your Mother,116,21
12790,Robin,21," What happened to ""I don't want a perfect wedding""?",2,How I Met Your Mother,51,9
12791,Lily,21," Oh, grow up, Robin! Of course I want a perfect wedding! Oh, God. I wanted... I wanted not to care about the wedding, but... I do. I... I'm supposed to feel like a princess today.",2,How I Met Your Mother,179,35
12792,Robin,21," And you will. It's gonna be okay, sweetie. Why don't we go outside? I have something that'll make you feel better.",2,How I Met Your Mother,115,21
12793,Lily,21," What could you have that could possibly make me feel better? God, I hope Marshall's having a better day than I'm having.",2,How I Met Your Mother,121,22
12795,Marshall,21," Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God!",2,How I Met Your Mother,60,15
12796,Ted,21, What?,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
12798,Barney,21," Well, it's not too short.",2,How I Met Your Mother,26,5
12799,Marshall,21, My hair! Look at my hair! She ruined my hair! I look like one of the Backstreet Boys!,2,How I Met Your Mother,86,18
12800,Barney,21," You totally do. And not even the good Backstreet Boys, the older, lame dance move, comeback tour Backstreet Boys.",2,How I Met Your Mother,114,19
12801,Ted,21, The good Backstreet Boys?,2,How I Met Your Mother,26,4
12802,Marshall,21, Guys! Guys! What am I gonna do?!,2,How I Met Your Mother,33,7
12803,Ted,21, What-what the hell happened to you?,2,How I Met Your Mother,36,6
12804,Marshall,21," Lily's cousin is in beauty school, and Lily didn't want her to do her hair, so she said she could do mine.",2,How I Met Your Mother,107,22
12806,Marshall,21," So, um, just not-not too short, okay?",2,How I Met Your Mother,38,7
12808,Marshall,21," Oh, okay, yeah, that's great. 'Cause, um, when it gets too short, it starts to look weird. And I don't want to look weird when I'm up there, you know.",2,How I Met Your Mother,151,30
12810,Marshall,21," I don't think I need advice on how to be cool, but yeah, great, lay that on me.",2,How I Met Your Mother,80,18
12812,Marshall,21, I can't get married like this! There's no way!,2,How I Met Your Mother,47,9
12813,Barney,21," Ah, let me see what I can do.",2,How I Met Your Mother,30,8
12814,Ted,21, What? What can you do?,2,How I Met Your Mother,23,5
12815,Barney,21, I have a superpower.,2,How I Met Your Mother,21,4
12816,Marshall,21, Lily is gonna kill me! Look at me! She's not gonna want to marry me like this.,2,How I Met Your Mother,79,17
12817,Ted,21, That's crazy. Of course she will.,2,How I Met Your Mother,34,6
12818,Marshall,21, Would you marry me?,2,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
12819,Ted,21, No. But not because of the hair. It's because I have a rule,2,How I Met Your Mother,60,13
12820,Marshall,21," Oh, great. So now you're saying Lily and I shouldn't even get married?",2,How I Met Your Mother,71,13
12823,Barney,21," Could I have everyone's attention, please? It's for the bride. One, the bride would... like all of this tension out of my shoulders. And she would like, let's say, you in the inappropriatel short dress to rub them. Two... What was two?",2,How I Met Your Mother,236,42
12825,Ted,21," Okay, we have a bit of a situation. Let's not panic. Let's just find a solution.",2,How I Met Your Mother,81,16
12827,Marshall,21," Yeah, yeah, but it's good. I ought to shave it all off. What a great solution. Just be bald 'cause it's cool, right? Bruce Willis, Michael Jordan, Britney Spears... Oh, God, what did I do?! How could you let me shave my head?!",2,How I Met Your Mother,227,43
12828,Ted,21, What?!,2,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
12829,Marshall,21, You're the worst best man ever! I hate you! I'm not going out there! I'm leaving and I'm never coming back.I'm gonna go find that money under the rock by the tree and go live with the guys on the beach in Zihautanejo.,2,How I Met Your Mother,218,43
12830,Ted,21," Dude, those guys are criminals.",2,How I Met Your Mother,32,5
12831,Marshall,21," Only Red Andy was falsely accused. Ted, you're my best man! You got to do something!",2,How I Met Your Mother,85,16
12832,Ted,21," Okay, all right, come here. Just breathe, breathe, all right? Don't worry. Don't worry. I'll just... I'll take these.",2,How I Met Your Mother,118,19
12833,Marshall,21, No!,2,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
12835,Ted,21," Uh, hi. Uncle Ben, right?",2,How I Met Your Mother,26,5
12837,Ted,21," Yes, we're, we're having a little bit of a problem back there. Um, and I was wondering if you could help us out.",2,How I Met Your Mother,113,23
12839,Ted,21, Marshall accidentally shaved part of his head.,2,How I Met Your Mother,47,7
12841,Ted,21," Yeah. Yeah, so here's what I was thinking. What if I found something to cover up the bald area?",2,How I Met Your Mother,96,19
12843,Ted,21," Maybe a wig of some sort or a, um... toupee. Something that matches",2,How I Met Your Mother,68,13
12846,Ted,21, That is true. That is true. We just need to find someone who wears a toupee that is the same color as Marshall's and your hair.,2,How I Met Your Mother,128,26
12848,Ted,21, Really? You can't think of any place in the general area where there might be a toupee of the kind I'm describing to you?,2,How I Met Your Mother,122,24
12850,Ted,21, Let me come at this from a different angle. I got $50 in my pocket which is probably a lot more... Barney comes and takes the toupee.,2,How I Met Your Mother,134,27
12851,Barney,21, The bride needs this.,2,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
12853,Marshall,21," Actually, I think it kinda works.",2,How I Met Your Mother,34,6
12854,Ted,21, It totally does.,2,How I Met Your Mother,17,3
12855,Marshall,21, Barney?,2,How I Met Your Mother,8,1
12856,Barney,21," To be honest, I'm, uh, I'm jealous I don't get to wear it.",2,How I Met Your Mother,59,13
12857,Marshall,21," Okay, problem solved. Crisis averted. Let's get me married. It looks terrible, doesn't it?",2,How I Met Your Mother,91,14
12858,Ted,21," It kinda looks like fur, which gives you the appearance of a cleaned-up Bigfoot.",2,How I Met Your Mother,81,14
12859,Marshall,21," Oh, you know...",2,How I Met Your Mother,16,3
12860,Ted,21, In a bad way.,2,How I Met Your Mother,14,4
12862,Ted,21, What happened to your shirt?,2,How I Met Your Mother,29,5
12864,Ted,21, You gonna put another shirt on?,2,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
12866,Marshall,21, What? What? Scooter's here? That guy's at my wedding?,2,How I Met Your Mother,54,9
12868,Marshall,21," Okay, you know what? I need some air. I think we should go for a walk, okay?",2,How I Met Your Mother,77,17
12870,Barney,21, It would cover up the problem. It's festive and it celebrates the heritage of this great nation.,2,How I Met Your Mother,97,17
12871,Ted,21," Okay, unless you actually have one in your car, stop suggesting authentic Native American headdress.",2,How I Met Your Mother,101,15
12872,Marshall,21," Oh, no.",2,How I Met Your Mother,8,2
12873,Lily,21," Oh, my God! Marshall...",2,How I Met Your Mother,24,4
12874,Marshall,21," Lily, you're not supposed to see me.",2,How I Met Your Mother,37,7
12875,Robin,21," Holy crap, I don't think anyone's supposed to see you.",2,How I Met Your Mother,55,10
12876,Lily,21, What happened? Did Amy do this to you?,2,How I Met Your Mother,39,8
12877,Marshall,21," Just the frosted tips. I did the rest. I'm sorry, baby. I've ruined the whole wedding, haven't I?",2,How I Met Your Mother,98,18
12878,Lily,21," Oh, no, you didn't ruin the wedding, sweetie. It was already ruined. There's no flowers, no photographer. Oh, and Scooter's here, by the way.",2,How I Met Your Mother,142,24
12879,Marshall,21," Yeah, I know. I heard.",2,How I Met Your Mother,23,5
12880,Lily,21," My veil got thrashed, the harp player is in labor, and I'm not wearing my wedding underwear.",2,How I Met Your Mother,93,17
12881,Marshall,21," What? No ""Property of Marshall"" across the back? How are people going to know whose butt that is?",2,How I Met Your Mother,98,18
12882,Lily,21," What happened? Remember the wedding we wanted, the intimate outdoor ceremony?",2,How I Met Your Mother,78,11
12883,Marshall,21, I wish we could have that wedding.,2,How I Met Your Mother,35,7
12884,Ted,21, So do it.,2,How I Met Your Mother,10,3
12885,Marshall,21, What?,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
12886,Ted,21," Get married now. Right here. Look, it's outside like you always wanted. Intimate, close friends. There's no guitar, but it's pretty close. Barney can officiate.",2,How I Met Your Mother,161,25
12887,Barney,21," Yes. Yes, I can. Uh, excuse me, guys. You all dropped something",2,How I Met Your Mother,64,12
12888,Marshall,21," Could we even do that? I mean, what about all those people in there?",2,How I Met Your Mother,69,14
12889,Robin,21," Do that one, too. And then when everything goes wrong, you won't care because you already had the real wedding out here.",2,How I Met Your Mother,121,22
12890,Marshall,21," What do you think, baby?",2,How I Met Your Mother,25,5
12891,Lily,21, I love it.,2,How I Met Your Mother,11,3
12892,Marshall,21," Me, too. Let's do it. Let's get married before we get married.",2,How I Met Your Mother,63,12
12893,Lily,21," Great. Wait, hold on. Excuse me, sir. Could we borrow your hat?",2,How I Met Your Mother,64,12
12895,Lily,21, Thank you.,2,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
12897,Marshall,21, Hat. We thought of authentic Native American headdress before we thought of hat.,2,How I Met Your Mother,81,13
12898,Barney,21," Thank you all for coming. For those of you who don't know me... I'm not the biggest believer in marriage. But... you two are so great together, you know? It's like you were, uh, made for each other.",2,How I Met Your Mother,199,38
12899,Robin,21, He's gonna cry.,2,How I Met Your Mother,16,3
12900,Barney,21," No, I'm not. I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not. Lily and Marshall... when everyone sees you, they... see true love. It's the best love... Can we just, um, move on to the rings or something?",2,How I Met Your Mother,200,39
12901,Marshall,21," Oh, no. I don't have my vows.",2,How I Met Your Mother,30,7
12902,Lily,21, I don't have mine either.,2,How I Met Your Mother,26,5
12903,Ted,21, You don't need your vows. Just say why you love each other.,2,How I Met Your Mother,60,12
12904,Marshall,21," Okay, I'll go first. Lily, there are a million reasons why I love you. You make me laugh and you take care of me when I'm sick. You're sweet, caring and you even created an egg dish and named it after me. She puts a little Italian dressing in scrambled eggs before she cooks them. It's called ""Eggs Marshall,"" and it's awesome. But the main reason that I love you is that you're my best friend, Lily. You're, uh... you're the best friend I ever had. I'm sorry, buddy.",2,How I Met Your Mother,468,89
12905,Ted,21, No problem.,2,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
12906,Barney,21, It's totally okay.,2,How I Met Your Mother,19,3
12907,Lily,21," My turn. Oh, thank you. Marshall, I love you because you're funny and you make me feel loved and you make me feel safe and for our anniversary you gave me a sweatshirt that says, ""Lily and Marshall. Rockin' It Since '96."" I kinda wish I was wearing it right now 'cause it smells like you. But the main reason I love you, Marshall Ericksen, is you make me happy. You make me happy all the time.",2,How I Met Your Mother,394,77
12908,Robin,21," Hey, I found your panties!",2,How I Met Your Mother,27,5
12909,Lily,21, I'm good.,2,How I Met Your Mother,10,2

12915,Lily,21, I do.,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,2
12916,Barney,21," Okay, then, by the power invested in me by the very bitter old Pakistani man who works down at the courthouse on Lafayette Street, I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride.",2,How I Met Your Mother,189,36
12918,Marshall,21, Did you smoke?,2,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
12919,Lily,21, No.,2,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
12920,Robin,21, Wow. First lie of marriage. That was fast.,2,How I Met Your Mother,43,8
12921,Ted,21," After that, we all went back inside for the second wedding. And yes, a lot of things did go wrong, but it didn't matter because when I look back on that day, what I remember is the first wedding; the intimate outdoor ceremony with just close friends and an acoustic guitar.",2,How I Met Your Mother,274,51
12923,Marshall,21, How do you feel?,2,How I Met Your Mother,17,4
12924,Lily,21, Tired. I got married twice today.,2,How I Met Your Mother,34,6
12925,Marshall,21," So where do you want to do it for the first time as a married couple, nice hotel room or a reception hall bathroom?",2,How I Met Your Mother,116,24
12926,Lily,21," What do you think? Bathroom, of course.",2,How I Met Your Mother,40,7
12928,Ted,21, Please don't.,2,How I Met Your Mother,14,2
12930,Lily,22, Does it make you kind of sad that we don't share the same last name?,2,How I Met Your Mother,69,15
12931,Marshall,22," You know, in a totally evolved 21st-century kind of way yeah, a little.",2,How I Met Your Mother,72,13
12932,Lily,22, You know what we should do? We should come up with a whole new last name.,2,How I Met Your Mother,74,16
12933,Marshall,22," Oh, that's easy-- Lily and Marshall Skywalker.",2,How I Met Your Mother,47,7
12934,Lily,22, Lily and Marshall Hasselhoff.,2,How I Met Your Mother,30,4

12951,Robin,22, Nothing.,2,How I Met Your Mother,9,1
12952,Barney,22," Oh, okay. Tell people what?",2,How I Met Your Mother,28,5
12953,Ted,22, Can we talk about this later?,2,How I Met Your Mother,30,6
12954,Barney,22, Absolutely. Tell people what?,2,How I Met Your Mother,30,4
12955,Robin,22, Hi. Have you met Barney?,2,How I Met Your Mother,25,5
12956,Barney,22," Hey. Barney Stinson. Lovely dress. I know, I'm sick of these things, too. It's like the same wedding over and over again. You're totally right. You want to dance? Great, see you out there. Tell people what?",2,How I Met Your Mother,207,37
12957,Ted,22," Look, this is just not something we want to talk about right now, okay, Barney?",2,How I Met Your Mother,80,15
12958,Barney,22, Okay. ,2,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
12959,Ted,22," Whoo, that was a close one.",2,How I Met Your Mother,28,6
12960,Robin,22, Think he'll actually let it go?,2,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
12964,Robin,22, Can I get a water please?,2,How I Met Your Mother,26,6
12965,Barney,22, Tell people what?,2,How I Met Your Mother,18,3
12966,Robin,22," Oh, God! Okay. Look, we have some... news.",2,How I Met Your Mother,43,8
12967,Ted,22, But we don't want to draw attention away from Lily and Marshall's big day.,2,How I Met Your Mother,75,14
12968,Robin,22, So just forget about it until they leave for the honeymoon.,2,How I Met Your Mother,60,11
12969,Barney,22, Fine.,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1

12972,Lily,22," Oh, help us.",2,How I Met Your Mother,13,3
12973,Robin,22, What's wrong?,2,How I Met Your Mother,14,2
12974,Lily,22," We're starving. We planned this amazing meal with the caterers, and we haven't had a bite of it.",2,How I Met Your Mother,97,18
12975,Marshall,22," Every time we get near the food, we get cocktail weiner blocked. We haven't eaten all day.",2,How I Met Your Mother,91,17
12976,Robin,22," All right, let's run some interference.",2,How I Met Your Mother,40,6
12977,Ted,22," Yeah, we'll get you back to your table. Come on.",2,How I Met Your Mother,49,10
12979,Lily,22," Thanks, Grammie, but we really need to...",2,How I Met Your Mother,42,7
12981,Marshall,22, And you look like a pepper-crusted rack of lamb with mint jelly.,2,How I Met Your Mother,65,12
12982,Robin,22," All right, let's get these two back to their table.",2,How I Met Your Mother,52,10
12984,Ted,22, The answer to that one was decided weeks earlier.,2,How I Met Your Mother,50,9

12989,Lily,22," Oh, that's great. Going on the list.",2,How I Met Your Mother,37,7
12990,Barney,22, What list?,2,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
12991,Lily,22, Horrible wedding clichí©es we're not going to touch with a ten-foot limbo pole.,2,How I Met Your Mother,80,13
12992,Barney,22," Oh, like First Corinthians? That Bible verse? They do that at every wedding.",2,How I Met Your Mother,77,13
12993,Robin,22, How's it go?,2,How I Met Your Mother,13,3
12994,Marshall,22," ""Love is patient and kind. ""Love does not envy or boast. ""It is not arrogant or rude. ""Love does not insist on it's own way. ""It is not irritable or resentful. ""Love bears all things, ""believes all things, ""hopes all things... ""endures all things.""",2,How I Met Your Mother,249,44
12995,Robin,22, Lame.,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
12996,Lily,22, Going on the list.,2,How I Met Your Mother,19,4
12998,Lily,22, We've done it. A wedding with zero clichí©es.,2,How I Met Your Mother,46,8
12999,Ted,22," Wait, isn't doing it in the reception hall bathroom kind of a clichí©e?",2,How I Met Your Mother,72,13
13000,Lily,22," Well, okay, one clichí©e.",2,How I Met Your Mother,26,4
13001,Marshall,22," Well, technically two.",2,How I Met Your Mother,23,3
13002,Lily,22, No! They cleared our plates again!,2,How I Met Your Mother,35,6

13004,Lily,22," Well, you still have me.",2,How I Met Your Mother,25,5
13005,Marshall,22, Yeah...,2,How I Met Your Mother,8,1
13006,Barney,22," Anyway, guys, we're kind of in the middle of something, so if you could go bicker or share a tense, sexless silence or whatever married people do somewhere else, that'd be great.",2,How I Met Your Mother,179,32
13007,Lily,22," No, Barney, this is my wedding, and I will sit wherever I damn well...",2,How I Met Your Mother,71,14
13008,Barney,22, Are those mini quiches?  Tell the secret.,2,How I Met Your Mother,42,7
13009,Ted,22," Okay, uh... it was our anniversary, so we went to this restaurant Carmichael's, which is where we went on our first date. Remember, the place where I stole the blue French horn for Robin?",2,How I Met Your Mother,188,34
13010,Barney,22," Oh, right, that was you. I knew that was somebody I knew.",2,How I Met Your Mother,58,12
13011,Ted,22," What? Dude, you were there. That was like a big iconic moment in all of our lives.",2,How I Met Your Mother,83,17
13012,Barney,22, Maybe in your life-- I got a lot of stuff going on.,2,How I Met Your Mother,52,12
13013,Robin,22," Okay, so we're sitting there and the waiter comes over...",2,How I Met Your Mother,58,10
13016,Robin,22," Um, we didn't order champagne.",2,How I Met Your Mother,31,5
13018,Ted,22, Wow. Thanks. Cheers.,2,How I Met Your Mother,21,3
13019,Robin,22," And there, sitting at the bottom of my champagne glass is...",2,How I Met Your Mother,61,11
13021,Lily,22, Mini quiche. You're a mega-douche.,2,How I Met Your Mother,35,5
13022,Barney,22," Oh, that's right, they moved that table back toward the kitchen, because that's where they're setting up a surprise chocolate fountain. Oh, no, I gave it away. So what was in the glass?",2,How I Met Your Mother,186,33
13023,Ted,22," Right. So the waiter comes up with two glasses of Dom. He says, ""Champagne?"" ""We didn't order any champagne."" ""Compliments of the house."" ""Wow.""",2,How I Met Your Mother,145,24
13024,Barney,22, You said that already!,2,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
13026,Ted,22," Right. So Robin looks down, and there at the bottom of her glass...",2,How I Met Your Mother,68,13
13027,Robin,22, Is an engagement ring.,2,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
13030,Barney,22, Don't get married.,2,How I Met Your Mother,19,3
13032,Barney,22," An engagement ring?No. No, no, no, no, no, no. Ted, you cannot do",2,How I Met Your Mother,66,13
13034,Ted,22, That's what she said.,2,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
13037,Robin,22," No, no, no, no, no. Ted, you cannot do this to me. No. No, no, no.",2,How I Met Your Mother,67,16
13038,Ted,22, What are you talking about?,2,How I Met Your Mother,28,5
13039,Robin,22," This. This is what I'm talking about. What is this doing in my champagne? Oh, God, listen... I just got to get out of here.",2,How I Met Your Mother,124,25
13040,Ted,22, That's not mine.,2,How I Met Your Mother,17,3
13041,Robin,22, What?,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
13042,Ted,22, That's not mine.,2,How I Met Your Mother,17,3
13043,Robin,22, Then whose is it?,2,How I Met Your Mother,18,4
13046,Robin,22, Wow. That was hilarious. I was like... what? Anyway.,2,How I Met Your Mother,53,9
13047,Ted,22, What the hell was that?,2,How I Met Your Mother,24,5
13048,Robin,22, What the hell was what?,2,How I Met Your Mother,24,5
13049,Ted,22, That reaction?,2,How I Met Your Mother,15,2
13050,Robin,22, I thought you were proposing to me.,2,How I Met Your Mother,36,7
13051,Ted,22, Really? Because it sounded like you thought I was trying to set you on fire.,2,How I Met Your Mother,77,15
13052,Robin,22," Ted, you know how I feel about marriage.",2,How I Met Your Mother,41,8
13053,Ted,22, Now more than ever.,2,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
13054,Robin,22," I'm sorry, were you planning on proposing tonight?",2,How I Met Your Mother,51,8
13055,Ted,22, No.,2,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
13056,Robin,22, Then why is this an issue?,2,How I Met Your Mother,27,6
13057,Ted,22," Because even though you don't want to get married, I'd like to think the fact that we've been together for a year, and that we love each other might get me a gentler reaction than, ""No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. ""Ted, you cannot do this to me. ""No. No, no, no.""",2,How I Met Your Mother,268,55
13058,Robin,22," Okay, you're right, I just... freaked out. I don't know why. I'm sorry. Can we please just let it go?",2,How I Met Your Mother,102,20
13059,Ted,22, No.,2,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
13061,Marshall,22," Hey, Stinson. Never lie to a man about a chocolate fountain.",2,How I Met Your Mother,61,11
13062,Robin,22, So did you guys find anything to eat?,2,How I Met Your Mother,38,8
13063,Lily,22, I had four strawberries.,2,How I Met Your Mother,25,4
13064,Ted,22, Was there a side of champagne with each of the strawberries?,2,How I Met Your Mother,61,11
13065,Lily,22, Yes.,2,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
13066,Marshall,22," Lily, you could have burped or said the word ""Yes,"" but the fact that you did both is exactly why I married you.",2,How I Met Your Mother,113,23
13067,Lily,22," Oh, look, more strawberries!",2,How I Met Your Mother,29,4
13068,Barney,22, So what happened next?,2,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
13070,Robin,22," Ted, don't do this.",2,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
13071,Ted,22," No, seriously. Where do you see yourself in five years?",2,How I Met Your Mother,56,10
13072,Robin,22, Where do you see yourself?,2,How I Met Your Mother,27,5
13073,Ted,22," Honestly, in five years... I probably want to be married.",2,How I Met Your Mother,58,10
13074,Robin,22, And I probably want to be in Argentina.,2,How I Met Your Mother,40,8
13075,Ted,22, Argentina?,2,How I Met Your Mother,11,1
13076,Robin,22," Or Tokyo, or Paris. Look, Ted, I don't know where I'm going to be in five years. And I don't want to know. I want my life to be an adventure.",2,How I Met Your Mother,142,31
13077,Ted,22," We have an expiration date, don't we?",2,How I Met Your Mother,38,7
13079,Barney,22," Oh, my God. You guys broke up. You guys broke up. I can't believe it.",2,How I Met Your Mother,70,15
13080,Ted,22, Barney... story's not over.,2,How I Met Your Mother,28,4
13082,Robin,22, Can we please not talk about this here. Can we go home?,2,How I Met Your Mother,56,12
13083,Ted,22," Yeah, of course. Uh, excuse me, I'm sorry about this. Can we actually...",2,How I Met Your Mother,73,13
13085,Ted,22, Wha... what?,2,How I Met Your Mother,13,2
13087,Ted,22, Run!,2,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
13090,Barney,22, Run? Your strategy was run?,2,How I Met Your Mother,28,5
13091,Ted,22, It was a perfectly good idea. They didn't have our credit card information. They didn't know us from Adam. I stand by it.,2,How I Met Your Mother,122,23
13092,Robin,22, Yeah? And how did that work out for you?,2,How I Met Your Mother,41,9
13094,Ted,22, I don't see why they had to keep my credit card and driver's license till we bring the horn back.,2,How I Met Your Mother,98,20
13095,Robin,22," Well, come on, Ted, can you blame them?",2,How I Met Your Mother,40,8
13097,Ted,22," Look, I'm sorry about the French horn. I want to make this right. So what we're going to do right now is, we're going to run!",2,How I Met Your Mother,126,26
13099,Ted,22, So... Argentina.,2,How I Met Your Mother,17,2
13100,Robin,22, Argentina.,2,How I Met Your Mother,11,1
13101,Ted,22, Why is this the first I've heard of Argentina?,2,How I Met Your Mother,47,9
13102,Robin,22," Mmm, American schools suck at geography. What would be the point in telling you that I want to live in Argentina? You don't want to live there.",2,How I Met Your Mother,144,27
13103,Ted,22, I could want to live in Argentina.,2,How I Met Your Mother,35,7
13104,Robin,22," No, you couldn't. I mean, you life is here and your career. I'm a journalist, my career could take me anywhere, and I hope it does.",2,How I Met Your Mother,132,26
13105,Ted,22," Hey. I could be an architect anywhere, too. They have buildings in Argentina. And Paris. And even Tokyo. I don't know if you ever saw Godzilla, but he wasn't knocking down a bunch of tents.",2,How I Met Your Mother,190,35
13106,Robin,22," So, what? You're saying you want to move to Argentina?",2,How I Met Your Mother,55,10
13107,Ted,22," Well, I always regretted not taking a year in college to live abroad. I just finished a big project at work. I got some money saved up. If ever there were a time in my life to do something like this, it's right now. Let's move to Argentina.",2,How I Met Your Mother,241,48
13108,Robin,22," Oh, shut up.",2,How I Met Your Mother,13,3
13109,Ted,22, You're scared I might not be kidding.,2,How I Met Your Mother,38,7
13110,Robin,22, Aren't you?,2,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
13111,Ted,22," Nope. Your move, Scherbatsky.",2,How I Met Your Mother,30,4
13112,Robin,22, Okay. Let's do it-- let's move to Argentina.,2,How I Met Your Mother,45,8
13114,Barney,22," No es posible! Nobody moves to Argentina. The Argentinean peso has dropped two-thirds in five years, the government is opposed to free market reforms, and the railroad has been a mess since the breakup of Ferrocarriles Argentinos. I hooked up with an Argentinean exchange student in a Porta-John outside Yankee Stadium. Man, she was chatty.",2,How I Met Your Mother,341,55
13115,Robin,22, Right? Right?,2,How I Met Your Mother,14,2
13116,Barney,22, You caught the bouquet?,2,How I Met Your Mother,24,4
13117,Ted,22, Barney. The story's not over yet.,2,How I Met Your Mother,34,6
13119,Robin,22," Wait, wait, wait, wait.",2,How I Met Your Mother,24,4
13120,Ted,22, What?,2,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
13121,Robin,22, I don't know if I can do this to you.,2,How I Met Your Mother,38,10
13122,Ted,22, Do what?,2,How I Met Your Mother,9,2
13123,Robin,22," Well, you say you want to move to Argentina, but you want to have kids.",2,How I Met Your Mother,72,15
13124,Ted,22," Oh, right. 'Cause there are no kids there. On Santa's map of the world, there's a big black ""X"" over Argentina.",2,How I Met Your Mother,112,21
13125,Robin,22, You know what I mean.,2,How I Met Your Mother,22,5
13126,Ted,22," No, I don't. Okay, say we had kids. They wouldn't have to grow up in some suburb somewhere. They would grow up on the road having adventures with us. Think of all the Hard Rock Cafe T-shirts they could collect.",2,How I Met Your Mother,211,40
13127,Robin,22," Ted, you know that kids were never a part of my plan. But if I was going to have someone's babies, I'd have your babies.",2,How I Met Your Mother,121,25

13439,Barney,1," See. All this time, I thought you need a wingman to fly, but the truth is you... you've got your own wings now.",3,How I Met Your Mother,112,23
13440,Ted,1, Hmm.,3,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
13441,Barney,1," Since you and Robin split, you've been gestating. Growing in your cocoon. And last night... you burst out of that cocoon..., like a majestic, uh... gosh, what is it that comes out of a cocoon? I was always bad at science.",3,How I Met Your Mother,222,41
13442,Lily,1, He's gonna say it.,3,How I Met Your Mother,19,4
13443,Ted,1, A butterfly?  What?,3,How I Met Your Mother,20,3
13444,Barney,1," Nothing, buddy.",3,How I Met Your Mother,16,2
13446,Ted,1, Ow. Why did that hurt so...? Oh my God!  I have a tattoo.,3,How I Met Your Mother,58,13
13447,Barney,1," Oh, that's not a tattoo. That, dear boy, is a tramp stamp.",3,How I Met Your Mother,59,12
13448,Ted,1, Tramp stamp?,3,How I Met Your Mother,13,2
13449,Barney,1," You know, a ho tat. Ass antlers. A Panama City license plate.",3,How I Met Your Mother,62,12
13451,Ted,1,"...Dary. Legendary! Man, I am so winning this breakup.",3,How I Met Your Mother,54,9
13453,Ted,1, What a wuss. Do you think exes can be friends?,3,How I Met Your Mother,47,10
13455,Ted,1," Hey, your name is Steve. And her ex-boyfriend's name is Steve. What are the odds of that...? Wait.",3,How I Met Your Mother,99,18

13459,Barney,1," Oh, yeah, that'll get it out.",3,How I Met Your Mother,30,6
13460,Marshall,1, Maybe you should try club soda.,3,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
13461,Ted,1," Oh, damn it, it really hurts. I need like, some ointment or something. What is this? Spanish massage oil. Spanish massage oil? What happened here last night?",3,How I Met Your Mother,158,27

13477,Marshall,1," We're sorry, Ted. It'll never happen again.",3,How I Met Your Mother,44,7
13478,Lily,1, It meant nothing to us. It just felt really really really good.,3,How I Met Your Mother,64,12
13479,Ted,1, I can't even look at you two right now.,3,How I Met Your Mother,40,9
13480,Marshall,1, Ted.,3,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
13482,Lily,1, He got a tramp stamp. ,3,How I Met Your Mother,23,5
13483,Ted,1," All right, first of all, this isn't one of those, ""I came all the way over here because I want you back"" things. There'll be no startling confession of love, no sweet indie rock song that swells up just as we're about to kiss, none of that crap. Got it?",3,How I Met Your Mother,254,50
13484,Robin,1, Okay.,3,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
13485,Ted,1," Good. Now, here's the thing. It sucks that you came back from Argentina with someone as awesome as Gael. And I know I have no right to be upset at you. We're broken up, life goes on, whatever. But you know what? We-we never did this. We-we had this polite breakup with no irrational yelling and that's just wrong. So I'm gonna yell irrationally for a while and you're just gonna have to stand there and deal with it, okay?",3,How I Met Your Mother,423,80
13486,Robin,1," If you feel like you need to do that, then...",3,How I Met Your Mother,46,10
13487,Ted,1,"  I think I do! I really think I do! So now, I'm yelling!",3,How I Met Your Mother,57,13
13488,Robin,1, You shaved.,3,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
13489,Ted,1,  I did.,3,How I Met Your Mother,8,2
13490,Robin,1, I like the beard.,3,How I Met Your Mother,18,4
13491,Ted,1,"  I liked it too, but it was getting kind of hot. Maybe in the winter, I'll grow it back out!  Okay, I'm done.",3,How I Met Your Mother,110,23
13492,Robin,1, I know it was weird showing up with Gael. I'm sorry.,3,How I Met Your Mother,53,11
13493,Ted,1," Look, us breaking up, it was the right thing. But it took some time to get over you, you know? I-I'm still getting over you. But you, you were over it the minute they started the in-flight movie.",3,How I Met Your Mother,196,38
13494,Robin,1," Over it? My first three days in Argentina, I cried my eyes out. I missed you so much. I wanted to go and prove how adventurous I am, but the truth is, it was really lonely. And that's why Gael happened.",3,How I Met Your Mother,203,41
13495,Ted,1, You weren't trying to win the break-up?,3,How I Met Your Mother,40,7
13496,Robin,1, I was trying to survive it.,3,How I Met Your Mother,28,6
13497,Ted,1," Okay. No. See, look, that all sounds good, and we'll still be friends and move on, but..., did he have to be so hot? The guy's an Adonis.",3,How I Met Your Mother,138,28
13498,Robin,1, He's not an Adonis.,3,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
13499,Ted,1, He's the Cadillac of rebound guys. Marshall has a crush on him. The guy's perfect.,3,How I Met Your Mother,83,15
13500,Robin,1, He's not perfect.,3,How I Met Your Mother,18,3
13501,Ted,1," Oh, come on. He's hot, he windsurfs, he massages things. Name one way I'm better than that guy.",3,How I Met Your Mother,96,18
13502,Robin,1," ""You're bigger"".",3,How I Met Your Mother,17,2
13503,Ted,1," Don't patronize me. If anything, he may even be a little bit taller.",3,How I Met Your Mother,69,13
13504,Robin,1," No, Ted... ""you're bigger"".",3,How I Met Your Mother,28,4
13505,Ted,1, I win!,3,How I Met Your Mother,7,2

13519,Ted,2," So, beeing married, different? Not different?",3,How I Met Your Mother,46,6
13520,Marshall,2," It's the same. Mostly, except I think I might be getting carpal tunnel. My hands keeps cramping up.",3,How I Met Your Mother,100,18
13521,Barney,2, I think the whole point of getting married was that you didn't have to do that anymore.,3,How I Met Your Mother,88,17
13522,Marshall,2," No, it's from writing all the thank you notes. Mostly.",3,How I Met Your Mother,55,10
13523,Lily,2," Yeah. You're writing constantly. There's forms we have to sign, our death folders, thank you notes...",3,How I Met Your Mother,102,16
13524,Barney,2, Whoa. Whoa. What are death folders?,3,How I Met Your Mother,36,6
13525,Lily,2, It's this thing they recommend you do in case one spouse died unexpectedly.,3,How I Met Your Mother,76,13
13526,Marshall,2, It's all the information your spouse might need all in one convenient location.,3,How I Met Your Mother,80,13

13531,Barney,2," Yeah. Wait, why?",3,How I Met Your Mother,17,3
13532,Marshall,2, I didn't know that I was supposed to write a letter. All Lily's gonna find in that folder are a bunch of bank statements and a funny list of things to do with my ashes.,3,How I Met Your Mother,169,35
13533,Ted,2, Marshall brownies.,3,How I Met Your Mother,19,2
13534,Marshall,2," Number six. Yeah. Oh, God, I am a bad husband. No, uh, no, I'll just write, I'll write Lily a letter tonight, everything'll be fine.",3,How I Met Your Mother,133,25
13535,Barney,2," That's right. Unless... you die between now and then. Ooh. But, come on, that's never gonna happen.",3,How I Met Your Mother,100,17
13536,Ted,2," Yes! There is one thing we can state with absolute certainly, it's that Marshall Eriksen is not going to die before writing that letter.",3,How I Met Your Mother,137,24
13537,Barney,2," No way at all. In fact, I dare God to smite down this perfectly healthy...",3,How I Met Your Mother,75,15

13555,Lily,2, Wow. It seems like a great trip.,3,How I Met Your Mother,33,7

13561,Ted,2, I'm just happy Robin's happy.,3,How I Met Your Mother,30,5

13565,Barney,2," Please, vacation romances have an expiration date. Gael's got a ""Best if banged by"" sticker on him.

13711,Lily,2, I tell you what. How about I make it all dirty stuff and slip in a little clean stuff?,3,How I Met Your Mother,87,19
13712,Marshall,2, You're the best. And maybe a couple polaroids?,3,How I Met Your Mother,47,8
13713,Ted,2, Come on. Let's get out of here. This night's a disaster.,3,How I Met Your Mother,57,11
13714,Barney,2, What?! This night couldn't have gone any better. We've just survived a mugging. You know what that means.,3,How I Met Your Mother,106,18
13715,Ted,2," ""Thank God, we're alive"" s*x.",3,How I Met Your Mother,30,5
13716,Barney,2," ""Thank God we're alive"" s*x. It's even better than ""I can't believe you just proposed to me"" s*x, which I've only had, like, four of five times. Ted, please, we are so close.",3,How I Met Your Mother,175,33
13717,Ted,2, All right. I'm in. I've never worked this hard for anything in my life.,3,How I Met Your Mother,72,14

13735,Ted,2," New Jersey is not ""pretty much New York"". You are not ""pretty much new yorkers"".",3,How I Met Your Mother,81,15
13737,Ted,2," Because I live here. That's right. I live here. Yes, we're full of crap. Yes, we pretended to be from out of town so we could sleep with you and leave in the morning. But you know what's even worse than that?! Saying you're a new yorker when you're not. Because, this is the greatest city in the world and you have to earn the right to call yourself a new yorker. So why don't you girls crawl into the open sewer pipe you call the Holland tunnel and flush yourselves back to ""pretty much New York""? Because I will do a lot to get laid, but I am not going to New Jersey!",3,How I Met Your Mother,570,114

13752,Robin,2, Wow. I just realized something.,3,How I Met Your Mother,32,5
13754,Robin,2," No, that you really suck. You're boring and lame and you're getting sand everywhere. Seriously, where is all the sand coming from? You're not the real me. All you are is me on vacation trying to get away from a break-up.",3,How I Met Your Mother,221,41
13758,Robin,2, What are you doing?,3,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
13763,Robin,2," All right, everyone out! I said everyone out!",3,How I Met Your Mother,46,8

13781,Lily,2," Marshall, I'm serious.",3,How I Met Your Mother,23,3

13844,Robin,3," Oh, that's the point. It's to hide the point that I haven't shaved my legs. I've begun a strict no-shave policy for the first three dates. It's all about self-control. If I don't shave, I must behave.",3,How I Met Your Mother,201,37
13845,Barney,3," FYI, it doesn't matter, baby. Guys just wanna get on the green. They don't mind going through the rough.",3,How I Met Your Mother,105,19

14102,Ted,3," What are you guys doing here? I've got, I've got...",3,How I Met Your Mother,52,10
14103,Lily,3," We know, we know, Ted. Well done, this is very impressive. Up top.",3,How I Met Your Mother,67,13
14105,Marshall,3," Yeah bro, up top.",3,How I Met Your Mother,18,4
14107,Lily,3," Oh, don't be gross.",3,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
14109,Ted,3," You guys need to get out of here right now. Please, take the fire escape.",3,How I Met Your Mother,74,15
14110,Marshall,3," No, no way. The other day I saw a pigeon take a crap on it and the whole thing shifted.",3,How I Met Your Mother,88,20
14111,Lily,3," Oh, you can use our bedroom.",3,How I Met Your Mother,29,6
14112,Ted,3," OK, all I need to seal the deal is the Wilco CD...Barney.",3,How I Met Your Mother,58,12
14114,Ted,3, What are you doing?,3,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
14115,Barney,3, I cannot allow Ted to do this.,3,How I Met Your Mother,31,7
14116,Ted,3," Why, why?",3,How I Met Your Mother,10,2
14117,Barney,3, Because the belt is my birthright. You can't claim it before I do. That would be like Jimmy Olsen capturing Lex Luther while Superman watches impotently from the bedroom.,3,How I Met Your Mother,171,29
14118,Marshall,3," But Barney, you've done way dirtier stuff than Ted. You're disgusting.",3,How I Met Your Mother,71,11
14119,Barney,3," I've never ridden the tricycle. I was on the verge last year, it was so close.",3,How I Met Your Mother,79,16
14121,Barney,3," So, ladies, why don't we move this party to a more horizontal location?",3,How I Met Your Mother,72,13
14126,Barney,3, I'll get the video camera.,3,How I Met Your Mother,27,5
14128,Barney,3, OK then.,3,How I Met Your Mother,9,2
14130,Ted,3, Let me get this straight. You're gonna trike block me? That is so petty. It's like you're...,3,How I Met Your Mother,93,17
14131,Marshall,3, Tom Petty.,3,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
14132,Ted,3, Tom Petty. You're Tom Petty.,3,How I Met Your Mother,29,5
14134,Ted,3, Where's Lily?,3,How I Met Your Mother,14,2
14136,Ted,3," Still looking for that CD, so...",3,How I Met Your Mother,33,6
14138,Ted,3, What are you doing?,3,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
14139,Lily,3, I knew it. I had a hunch about that girl and I was right.,3,How I Met Your Mother,58,14
14141,Lily,3, I saw it first.,3,How I Met Your Mother,16,4
14143,Lily,3," You just made the list, bitch.",3,How I Met Your Mother,31,6
14146,Lily,3," I cannot give up my bedroom to a boot thief. She should be punished, not rewarded.",3,How I Met Your Mother,83,16
14147,Ted,3," Fine, then I'll try to work in a little light spanking. Just do this for me.",3,How I Met Your Mother,77,16
14148,Lily,3," No, never.",3,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
14150,Ted,3," What if I reimburse you for the boots, full retail?",3,How I Met Your Mother,52,10
14152,Lily,3," Thanks, enjoy our bedroom.",3,How I Met Your Mother,27,4
14154,Ted,3," OK, take it.",3,How I Met Your Mother,13,3
14156,Ted,3, Wish me luck.,3,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
14158,Barney,3, Oh my God.,3,How I Met Your Mother,11,3
14162,Robin,3, Where's the shaving cream?,3,How I Met Your Mother,27,4
14164,Robin,3," Well, it was implied. Who buys a razor without buying shaving cream?",3,How I Met Your Mother,69,12
14166,Robin,3," Well, who's not getting a tip because of her attitude?",3,How I Met Your Mother,55,10
14169,Robin,3, Absolutely. I just have to go to the ladies room. I've got TB...tiny bladder. I'll meet you out front?,3,How I Met Your Mother,103,19
14172,Robin,3, You've gotta be kidding me.,3,How I Met Your Mother,28,5
14174,Robin,3, Excuse me.,3,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
14178,Ted,3," So, I'm having a little trouble finding the CD.",3,How I Met Your Mother,48,9
14181,Ted,3, Exactly.,3,How I Met Your Mother,9,1
14184,Ted,3," It's getting late, I'll get your coats.",3,How I Met Your Mother,40,7
14188,Lily,3, I'll get your coats? Ted,3,How I Met Your Mother,25,5
14189,Marshall,3," Ted, you're ruining this for everyone.",3,How I Met Your Mother,39,6
14190,Barney,3, Leave him alone! Sometimes even the greatest warriors shoot themselves in the foot.,3,How I Met Your Mother,84,13
14191,Lily,3, What are you talking about? Barney,3,How I Met Your Mother,35,6
14195,Barney,3," Oh no, the night's ruined!",3,How I Met Your Mother,27,5
14197,Barney,3, Yes it is. Whatever this night was heading towards is ruined. Where's my coat?,3,How I Met Your Mother,79,14
14199,Marshall,3, Why would you do that to yourself?,3,How I Met Your Mother,35,7
14200,Barney,3," Because you get up in your head, man. Start thinking, I can't do this. It's two women. That's two of everything, four of some things. The logistics alone are enough to cripple even a pro like me.",3,How I Met Your Mother,196,37
14201,Ted,3," See? If a complete degenerate like Barney choked, what chance do I have?",3,How I Met Your Mother,73,13
14202,Barney,3," The best chance in the world. Fear took the belt from me. Fear rode the tricycle that night, my friends. But fear will not get a second turn.",3,How I Met Your Mother,142,28
14203,Ted,3, It won't?,3,How I Met Your Mother,10,2
14204,Barney,3," No, because I now realize it isn't my destiny to win the belt. It is my destiny to help my friend win it. Ted is fated to go there first. He is our Neil Armstrong.  Space-suit-up, Ted, 'cause you're going to the moon. Step 1.",3,How I Met Your Mother,226,45
14206,Ted,3," Ladies, couldn't find your coats but I did find tequila.",3,How I Met Your Mother,57,10
14210,Ted,3," Wait, wait wait, a remote control fire place? We don't have a remote control fire place.",3,How I Met Your Mother,89,16
14217,Ted,3, Why would I want to tire them out?,3,How I Met Your Mother,35,8
14219,Barney,3, That's your excuse to unleash pretext for physical contact number one.,3,How I Met Your Mother,71,11
14222,Ted,3, It's 'cause I used to practice all the time on my grandmother.,3,How I Met Your Mother,63,12
14224,Ted,3, Why in God's name would I say that?,3,How I Met Your Mother,36,8
14229,Ted,3, I was just thinking about this documentary I saw once about something called a supervolcano.,3,How I Met Your Mother,93,15
14231,Ted,3," OK, what the hell.",3,How I Met Your Mother,19,4
14233,Barney,3," OK, wait for it.",3,How I Met Your Mother,17,4
14235,Ted,3," Could happen at any time and obliterate all life on earth, which is why I live by three simple words. Don't postpone joy.",3,How I Met Your Mother,122,23
14238,Ted,3, Yeah.,3,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
14240,Ted,3," Mortality angle, that's actually pretty good. I can do this.",3,How I Met Your Mother,61,10
14241,Barney,3, Yes you can.,3,How I Met Your Mother,13,3
14242,Lily,3," I can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I'm actually moved. Bring it in, guys.",3,How I Met Your Mother,79,15
14244,Ted,3, All right.,3,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
14246,Ted,3, I'll see you on the other side.,3,How I Met Your Mother,32,7
14252,Barney,3," So, what happened next? Did you do it? Ted",3,How I Met Your Mother,43,9
14253,Barney,3, What? No! Tell me. Don't tell me because you don't have to because you didn't do it.,3,How I Met Your Mother,85,17
14255,Barney,3," You didn't do it. You did it. You did it, didn't you? Did you?",3,How I Met Your Mother,63,14
14257,Barney,3," You didn't do it. Yes, you did. You did. No, you... Just tell me!",3,How I Met Your Mother,66,14
14258,Ted,3," Some stories you tell, some stories you don't.",3,How I Met Your Mother,47,8
14259,Barney,3," Because you didn't do it. He didn't do it. You did it, you did it, you did it. Tell me, did you?",3,How I Met Your Mother,97,22
14261,Barney,3," Ted, belt.",3,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
14264,Barney,3, Did? Tell me. You know if he did it?,3,How I Met Your Mother,37,9
14281,Robin,3," I'm here, I'm fine, my head is bleeding. Going down again.",3,How I Met Your Mother,59,11
14288,Lily,4, 100! We only got to 82 on our honeymoon.,3,How I Met Your Mother,41,9
14290,Lily,4," So, Robin, I've got a guy for you. He's cute, he's funny, he's smart.",3,How I Met Your Mother,70,14
14291,Ted,4, What's his 'but'?,3,How I Met Your Mother,18,3
14292,Lily,4, What do you mean? Ted,3,How I Met Your Mother,22,5
14294,Barney,4, She's totally hot and really fun.,3,How I Met Your Mother,34,6
14295,Barney,4,  But she has a dead tooth.,3,How I Met Your Mother,27,6
14297,Marshall,4, She's superhot and she's so successful.,3,How I Met Your Mother,40,6
14298,Marshall,4,  But she has a pug that she pushes around in a stroller.,3,How I Met Your Mother,57,12
14300,Lily,4, She's so cute and she's so smart.,3,How I Met Your Mother,34,7
14301,Lily,4,  But her last boyfriend had to get a restraining order against her and then his cat and new vacuum cleaner both went missing.,3,How I Met Your Mother,126,23
14302,Ted,4," Wow, set it up.",3,How I Met Your Mother,16,4
14304,Ted,4, I'm still convinced she killed my turtle.,3,How I Met Your Mother,42,7
14305,Robin,4," Hey, you know what, not every setup has a 'but'. What about, um, Jamie, that girl that Lily set you up with? She was really nice.",3,How I Met Your Mother,130,26
14306,Barney,4," If memory serves me, she had a huge 'but'. Her huge butt. Nailed it!",3,How I Met Your Mother,69,14
14308,Lily,4," Well, there's nothing wrong with this guy. He's really nice and he's really cute.",3,How I Met Your Mother,82,14
14309,Ted,4, But? Lily,3,How I Met Your Mother,10,2
14310,Marshall,4, Oh.,3,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
14311,Ted,4, Aha! There it is. Robin's not going out with a guy with a kid.,3,How I Met Your Mother,63,14
14312,Lily,4," But the guy is really great. And his kid's sweet, he's in my class.",3,How I Met Your Mother,68,14
14313,Ted,4, Doesn't matter. Robin hates kids.,3,How I Met Your Mother,34,5
14314,Robin,4, I don't hate kids.,3,How I Met Your Mother,19,4
14315,Ted,4," You told me even when you were a kid, you hated kids.",3,How I Met Your Mother,54,12
14320,Robin,4," OK, yes, kids are not my favorite thing in the world but I like them.",3,How I Met Your Mother,70,15
14321,Ted,4," Well, you don't wanna have them.",3,How I Met Your Mother,33,6
14322,Robin,4, I like sports cars but it doesn't mean I wanna push a Ferrari through my vagina,3,How I Met Your Mother,80,16
14323,Barney,4, Shotgun.,3,How I Met Your Mother,9,1
14325,Marshall,4," You can't blame us for thinking that the kid would be a problem. I mean, if we were friends with Garfield, we wouldn't set him up on a date with Mondays.",3,How I Met Your Mother,154,31
14326,Barney,4, Nice.,3,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
14327,Robin,4," You know what, the kid is not a problem. I wanna meet this guy.",3,How I Met Your Mother,64,14
14328,Lily,4," OK, that's awesome.",3,How I Met Your Mother,20,3
14329,Robin,4," Yeah. Hey, what's my 'but'? You know, I'm really nice, but...",3,How I Met Your Mother,62,11
14330,Ted,4,  But she's afraid of commitment.,3,How I Met Your Mother,33,5
14331,Lily,4,  But she's a gun nut.,3,How I Met Your Mother,22,5
14332,Barney,4,  But she's Canadian.,3,How I Met Your Mother,21,3
14333,Marshall,4,  But she didn't like Field of Dreams.,3,How I Met Your Mother,38,7
14334,Barney,4, I can't think of anything.,3,How I Met Your Mother,27,5
14335,Ted,4, You don't have a 'but'.,3,How I Met Your Mother,24,5
14339,Barney,4," OK, I've got it. Here, put on this eye patch.",3,How I Met Your Mother,46,10
14341,Ted,4, Why?,3,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
14342,Barney,4, The ultimate ice breaker.,3,How I Met Your Mother,26,4
14344,Barney,4," A bunch of cobras got loose in Central Park. You and I are jogging, training for the Death Valley Iron Man. No big deal, we do it every year. Suddenly we see these snake bastards sneaking towards a little baby. Not on our watch. You grab the kid, I strangle six cobras with my bare hands. Women of New York, one at a time please.",3,How I Met Your Mother,330,65
14345,Ted,4," So, what are the eye patches for?",3,How I Met Your Mother,34,7
14346,Barney,4, We got bit.,3,How I Met Your Mother,12,3
14347,Ted,4, On the eye? Barney,3,How I Met Your Mother,19,4
14348,Ted,4, Both of us.,3,How I Met Your Mother,12,3
14349,Barney,4, They're different eyes. I don't see why this bugs you. Patch up!,3,How I Met Your Mother,65,12
14355,Robin,4," OK, here's the thing, George is a great guy, we had a wonderful date.",3,How I Met Your Mother,70,14
14356,Lily,4, But?,3,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
14359,Robin,4, Can't wait to meet him? Why did I say that? I don't wanna meet his kid.,3,How I Met Your Mother,72,16
14360,Lily,4," Well, you knew you'd meet him sooner or later.",3,How I Met Your Mother,47,9
14361,Robin,4," I was just hoping for later, like in 20 years when I'm a cougar and he's as hot as his dad.",3,How I Met Your Mother,92,21
14362,Lily,4," Robin, What's the big deal? He's just a kid. He's not gonna bite. He may bite. We're working on biting.",3,How I Met Your Mother,104,20
14363,Robin,4, Why is this kid around anyway? Shouldn't he be with his mom? What kind of lawyer does this guy have if he has to take care of the kid all the time?,3,How I Met Your Mother,148,32
14364,Lily,4, A good one. He won full custody.,3,How I Met Your Mother,33,7
14365,Robin,4," He won? He won. Oh God, getting the kid is winning, isn't it?",3,How I Met Your Mother,62,13
14367,Robin,4, Don't tell anyone I said that.,3,How I Met Your Mother,31,6
14370,Ted,4," OK, I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. People with real game don't need eye patches.",3,How I Met Your Mother,91,18
14371,Barney,4," Oh, Theodore...",3,How I Met Your Mother,16,2
14373,Barney,4,"...no no no, you can't spell game without me, and me has the best game.",3,How I Met Your Mother,71,15
14374,Ted,4," Yeah, well, I got so much game, I'm Cornish game hen.",3,How I Met Your Mother,54,11
14375,Barney,4, Oh yeah? I'm the New York state gaming commissioner.,3,How I Met Your Mother,53,9
14376,Ted,4," Well, I'm The Game, well-crafted, keep-you-guessing thriller starring Michael Douglas and Sean Penn.",3,How I Met Your Mother,101,13
14377,Barney,4, Wow.,3,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
14379,Marshall,4, Wow. You're here and not in stall two.,3,How I Met Your Mother,39,8
14380,Ted,4," Yeah, so?",3,How I Met Your Mother,10,2
14381,Marshall,4, I may have made some wildly inappropriate homoerotic comments to a gentleman wearing your shoes.,3,How I Met Your Mother,97,15
14382,Barney,4," OK, Marshall.",3,How I Met Your Mother,14,2
14383,Marshall,4, Yes.,3,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
14384,Barney,4, Which one of us has more game?,3,How I Met Your Mother,31,7
14385,Marshall,4," Neither of you guys has any game, right, or else you'd be married like me.",3,How I Met Your Mother,75,15
14386,Barney,4, What? Marshall,3,How I Met Your Mother,15,2
14387,Ted,4," Yeah, if you're playing in the women's league.",3,How I Met Your Mother,47,8
14388,Marshall,4," You're joking. I have mad game, bra.",3,How I Met Your Mother,37,7
14389,Barney,4," OK. One, we agreed not to ever say 'bra' anymore. It was a good week, we had a lot of fun, but it's over. Two, you've been with Lily for eleven years. You're idea of good game is slapping on a Dr. Seuss hat and flashing two tickets to a Spin Doctors concert.",3,How I Met Your Mother,259,53
14390,Ted,4," I hate to say it, buddy, but you're kinda' irrelevant.",3,How I Met Your Mother,55,10
14391,Marshall,4, What? I am not irrelevant. I know tons of stuff. I could help you guys. I don't wanna be left out.,3,How I Met Your Mother,99,21
14392,Barney,4," Ted, you do not have more game than me. By sheer numbers alone, I win. Come on, dude, you've seen my list.",3,How I Met Your Mother,107,22
14393,Marshall,4, Do you guys wanna hear one of my lines?,3,How I Met Your Mother,40,9
14394,Ted,4," First of all, I did not ask to see that list and I am still horrified. True game is about quality, not quantity. And a quality girl would pick me over you any day.",3,How I Met Your Mother,164,34
14395,Marshall,4, Are you a model? That one's good because it's flattering to the girl.,3,How I Met Your Mother,70,13
14396,Barney,4," Ted, I challenge you to a picking-up-girls Olympiad.",3,How I Met Your Mother,53,8
14397,Ted,4, Fine.,3,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
14398,Barney,4, There will be 26 events spread out over 11 weeks. We will travel to a neutral city where a panel of international judges...,3,How I Met Your Mother,124,23
14399,Ted,4, Or we could just choose a girl and the first one to seal the deal wins.,3,How I Met Your Mother,72,16
14400,Barney,4, That's good too.,3,How I Met Your Mother,17,3
14402,Barney,4, How about her?,3,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
14403,Ted,4, You're on.,3,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
14405,Barney,4," Before we start, why don't we jot down a few basic ground rules?",3,How I Met Your Mother,65,13
14407,Ted,4," OK, great. Rule number one, no eye patches or props of any kind.",3,How I Met Your Mother,65,13
14409,Marshall,4," One time I was with this girl and I tried that model line, and I totally got some over-the-shirt boob action at a Just Say No assembly.",3,How I Met Your Mother,136,27
14410,Ted,4, Just stop. You're bumming everybody out.,3,How I Met Your Mother,41,6
14412,Ted,4," Rule number two, this bet is for one million dollars.",3,How I Met Your Mother,54,10
14414,Barney,4, I win.,3,How I Met Your Mother,7,2
14415,Ted,4, How?,3,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
14416,Barney,4," Oh, I slept with her, about a year ago, I just forgot.",3,How I Met Your Mother,55,12
14417,Ted,4," Oh, well, that doesn't count. The bet started the moment we shook.",3,How I Met Your Mother,67,12
14418,Barney,4, I can't sleep with her again. She hates me.,3,How I Met Your Mother,44,9
14419,Ted,4," Oh, Interesting. Look who just took a commanding lead. Now, with you out of the picture, I can take my sweet time.",3,How I Met Your Mother,115,22
14420,Marshall,4," Ted, she's leaving.",3,How I Met Your Mother,20,3
14421,Ted,4, Get out of my way.,3,How I Met Your Mother,19,5
14423,Barney,4," By the look of those shoes, here comes your bathroom buddy.",3,How I Met Your Mother,60,11
14425,Marshall,4, Look who's got game.,3,How I Met Your Mother,21,4
14430,Robin,4," Only the biggest ever. I think kids are so great. Especially the little ones. You know, uh, pudgy, can't sit up, don't have teeth yet.",3,How I Met Your Mother,135,25
14432,Robin,4," Yeah, I like that kind.",3,How I Met Your Mother,24,5
14434,Robin,4," Oh, six is great. You are gonna love six. Six is when they really start to...  I hate kids.",3,How I Met Your Mother,92,19
14437,Robin,4," Yeah, let's take things slow.",3,How I Met Your Mother,30,5
14446,Lily,4," Hey, what's up?",3,How I Met Your Mother,16,3
14448,Robin,4," It's here, Lily. It's looking at me. The kid, what do I do?",3,How I Met Your Mother,60,13
14450,Lily,4," Just talk to him. You can do this, Robin.",3,How I Met Your Mother,42,9
14455,Robin,4, No it's not. It's actually a type of bird.,3,How I Met Your Mother,43,9
14457,Robin,4," Dude, I'm just reading my paper.",3,How I Met Your Mother,33,6
14459,Robin,4, Sure.,3,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
14463,Robin,4, It all tastes the same once it's in the bowl.,3,How I Met Your Mother,46,10
14465,Robin,4, Milk first it is.,3,How I Met Your Mother,18,4
14470,Robin,4," Well, maybe if they weren't such idiots, I wouldn't have to call them that.",3,How I Met Your Mother,76,14
14472,Robin,4, You too.,3,How I Met Your Mother,9,2

14489,Marshall,4," I am not irrelevant. I ran the numbers. If Lily and I have s*x twice a week, which, let's be honest, we all know is being conservative. And we've been together for ten years plus seventeen more times on the honeymoon. Minus the two week drought when I said the checker at the grocery store reminded me of a young Lily. Then we have had s*x a total of...wait for it...",3,How I Met Your Mother,368,71

14497,Ted,4," Oh, OK, OK, I see what you're doing.",3,How I Met Your Mother,37,8
14498,Barney,4," We've never shared a woman, have we, Ted? Isn't that funny? You're with her now, I was with her a year ago. You figure for her, that's like 200 showers ago. You gotta ask yourself, Ted, is 200 enough? Ted",3,How I Met Your Mother,205,40
14500,Barney,4," No, I'm sure when you're with her I'll be the furthest thing from your mind. Kissing what I've already kissed. Nuzzling what I've already nuzzled. Going  on what I've already gone  on.",3,How I Met Your Mother,185,32
14501,Ted,4," Barney, I'm not afraid of catching your cooties, OK?",3,How I Met Your Mother,53,9
14502,Barney,4," Really? Ted's not afraid of cooties. OK, well then I guess you'd have no problem having a sip of my gin and tonic.",3,How I Met Your Mother,115,23
14504,Ted,4, Fine.,3,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
14506,Barney,4, And I only stirred that with my pinky.,3,How I Met Your Mother,39,8

14512,Lily,4, What?,3,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
14513,Robin,4," Well, tt's just getting a little bit too serious with the kid. You know, it's just not what I'm looking for. So, better that I break it off now before he gets too attached.",3,How I Met Your Mother,173,34

14532,Marshall,4," You're joking, right?",3,How I Met Your Mother,22,3
14533,Robin,4, It's not me.,3,How I Met Your Mother,13,3
14534,Ted,4," ""My new mommy."" Kinda has a nice ring to it.",3,How I Met Your Mother,45,10
14535,Marshall,4," Hey, now that you're a mom, are you gonna start wearing those totally awesome jeans that go right up to your boobs?",3,How I Met Your Mother,116,22
14536,Robin,4, Do guys really think this is me?,3,How I Met Your Mother,33,7
14537,Lily,4," Honey, it's you. And if you're gonna break up with George, you have to break up with his kid too.",3,How I Met Your Mother,98,20
14538,Robin,4, Really?,3,How I Met Your Mother,8,1

14561,Robin,4," Oh, that is so sweet, Even though it doesn't rhyme.",3,How I Met Your Mother,52,10
14563,Robin,4," Look, uh, Doug. There's no good way to say this.",3,How I Met Your Mother,49,10
14566,Robin,4," We need to talk. I just think, um, we both could use some space right now. It's not you, it's me. I know this hurts but you deserve someone better. I'm just really trying to focus on my career right now, you know. I just hope we can still be friends.",3,How I Met Your Mother,251,51

14589,Marshall,4, Which Chumbawumba song? Barney,3,How I Met Your Mother,31,4
14590,Ted,4," What do you mean, win? You couldn't even talk to her. You tried, you got slapped.",3,How I Met Your Mother,82,16

14593,Ted,4," OK, great, rule number one no eye patches or props of any...",3,How I Met Your Mother,61,12
14595,Barney,4, Here's the deal. My friend just got dumped so he's a little shy but he'd love to buy you a drink and get to know you. The problem is he thinks a pretty girl like you won't go for a guy like him. So would you slap me across the face so he could see you're not into guys who feed you lines? What do you say? For my friend?,3,How I Met Your Mother,321,70
14599,Barney,4," So now, whatever nice things Ted does for her, in her mind, I'm the guy who's even nicer than him.",3,How I Met Your Mother,99,20

14644,Lily,4, I can't believe you got dumped by a 6-year-old.,3,How I Met Your Mother,48,9

14671,Ted,5, What? There's no stigma anymore.,3,How I Met Your Mother,33,5
14672,Robin,5," Oh, there's a stigma. That's why people always say there's no stigma anymore.",3,How I Met Your Mother,78,13
14673,Barney,5," So, she's hot.",3,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
14674,Ted,5," Oh, she's gorgeous.",3,How I Met Your Mother,20,3
14675,Barney,5, Then she's crazy.,3,How I Met Your Mother,18,3
14676,Ted,5, No she's not.,3,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
14677,Barney,5," Ted, the only hot girls that troll the Internet for dudes are crazy, hookers or dudes.",3,How I Met Your Mother,87,16
14678,Ted,5," OK, she's not crazy, she's not a hooker, she's not a dude. Though there's this guy I pass on my work every day who's all three, scares the crap out of me.",3,How I Met Your Mother,155,32
14679,Barney,5, There's no way she's above the line on the hot-crazy scale.,3,How I Met Your Mother,60,11
14680,Ted,5, She's not even on the hot-crazy scale. She's just hot.,3,How I Met Your Mother,55,10
14681,Robin,5," Wait, hot-crazy scale?",3,How I Met Your Mother,23,3

14690,Barney,5," If she's this crazy, she has to be this hot.",3,How I Met Your Mother,45,10
14692,Barney,5, You want the girl to be above this line,3,How I Met Your Mother,40,9

14715,Lily,5, Aw.,3,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
14716,Marshall,5, Starts with it too.,3,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
14718,Lily,5, It was late August 1996,3,How I Met Your Mother,24,5
14719,Marshall,5, Lily and I were both freshmen moving into,3,How I Met Your Mother,42,8
14732,Marshall,5," I know, right?",3,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
14735,Marshall,5," Dude, this black-haired Goth chick stopped by today,  wanna tap that.",3,How I Met Your Mother,70,11
14743,Ted,5," Anybody'd be stressed out meeting new people. She's not crazy. Crazy generous maybe, buying us drinks.",3,How I Met Your Mother,103,16

14768,Marshall,5, I didn't realize Ted wasn't the dean until later that night.,3,How I Met Your Mother,61,11
14770,Marshall,5, You're not the dean.,3,How I Met Your Mother,21,4
14773,Robin,5," College, good times.",3,How I Met Your Mother,21,3
14775,Barney,5," Oh, here we go.",3,How I Met Your Mother,16,4
14778,Barney,5, Your own line of handbags? That's crazy.,3,How I Met Your Mother,41,7
14780,Robin,5," Uh, no, but I would love to buy one of them if... Where can I get one?",3,How I Met Your Mother,71,17
14782,Robin,5," Look, there's nothing going on between me and Ted.",3,How I Met Your Mother,51,9
14784,Robin,5," No, I'm just saying you don't have anything to worry about.",3,How I Met Your Mother,60,11
14786,Robin,5," No, I'm saying that you shouldn't be.",3,How I Met Your Mother,38,7

14793,Barney,5," No, it's OK. I have to take care of him now. Of course, I have had to put my dreams on hold in order to do it, but I'm happy to. He's my brother and I love him. I'm sorry, it's all still so fresh.",3,How I Met Your Mother,197,45
14794,Ted,5," Oh man, I'm really sorry.",3,How I Met Your Mother,26,5
14796,Barney,5," Wow, you bought that?",3,How I Met Your Mother,22,4

14805,Barney,5," Ted, I'm gonna teach you how to live.",3,How I Met Your Mother,38,8
14807,Barney,5, Barney. We met at the urinal.,3,How I Met Your Mother,30,6
14808,Ted,5," Oh right, hi.",3,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
14809,Barney,5," Lesson one, lose the goatee, it doesn't go with your suit.",3,How I Met Your Mother,59,11
14810,Ted,5, I'm not wearing a suit.,3,How I Met Your Mother,24,5
14811,Barney,5," Lesson two, get a suit. Sutis are cool. Exhibit A.",3,How I Met Your Mother,51,10

14816,Barney,5,"  Edward, this is Audrey.",3,How I Met Your Mother,25,4
14819,Barney,5, He doesn't sign. He's embarrassed by his hands. They're tiny and lady-like.,3,How I Met Your Mother,76,12
14820,Ted,5,  I'm Edward. Nice to meet you too.,3,How I Met Your Mother,35,7
14821,Barney,5, What? You are over your hand issues. It's about time.,3,How I Met Your Mother,54,10
14822,Ted,5,  My brother's a great guy. You should give him your phone number.,3,How I Met Your Mother,66,12
14827,Barney,5," And even though that girl ended up giving me a fake number, I knew that Ted and I would be each other's wingmen forever.",3,How I Met Your Mother,121,24
14828,Ted,5," Barney, it's time you knew, um, that story actually goes a little bit differently.",3,How I Met Your Mother,83,14
14830,Ted,5,  He's lying to you. Just give him a fake number.,3,How I Met Your Mother,49,10
14833,Barney,5," Great, funny. God, with a wingman like Ted, I might need to resort to meeting someone in a super desperate and lame way, like online. Online. Online.",3,How I Met Your Mother,150,27
14835,Ted,5," OK, yes, I told them, but it's not a big deal. Lots of people meet on the Internet. That whole seeing a stranger across a crowded room thing, that only happens in the movies.",3,How I Met Your Mother,175,34
14836,Barney,5," Yeah, that never happens. Oh wait, except you and Robin. That's how you guys met, right?",3,How I Met Your Mother,89,16
14840,Robin,5," A year. But don't worry, the relationship wasn't that good. By the end, it was mostly about s*x, which was not that good. But I was the problem. I'd just lie there. Ted is very good. I'm sure he will get you where you need to go. Can I buy your bags online?",3,How I Met Your Mother,258,53
14843,Ted,5," Come on, blah-blah, it's not like that.",3,How I Met Your Mother,40,7
14846,Barney,5," Well, we're closing in on the half. Let's see how Blah-blah's doing on the crazy-hot scale.",3,How I Met Your Mother,92,16
14848,Barney,5, She started the night here,3,How I Met Your Mother,27,5
14850,Barney,5," But as the night's progressed, she's gotten crazier but no hotter which has caused her to drift across the Mendoza diagonal and dangerously close to the Shelley Gillespie zone.",3,How I Met Your Mother,177,29
14852,Barney,5, Another girl I dated. She gained twenty pounds and tried to kill me with a brick.,3,How I Met Your Mother,82,16
14854,Ted,5," I'm sorry I didn't tell you, but seriously there's nothing going on with me and Robin.",3,How I Met Your Mother,87,16
14858,Ted,5, Their story is not as magical as it seems.,3,How I Met Your Mother,43,9
14860,Ted,5," No, I can't, it's kind of a secret.",3,How I Met Your Mother,36,8
14863,Ted,5," The night before Lily met Marshall, there was this party.",3,How I Met Your Mother,58,10
14880,Ted,5," As drunk as she was, when she woke up the next morning, she still remembered room 110. That's why she knocked on the door. She was looking for me.",3,How I Met Your Mother,147,29

14941,Barney,5," Yes, yes, pep talk. You can do this, but to be more accurate, you probably can't. You're way out of practice and she is way too hot for you. So, remember, tonight isn't about scoring, it's about believing that you can do it even though you probably can't. Go get him, tiger.",3,How I Met Your Mother,275,52

14959,Lily,5," Baby, I am so sorry.",3,How I Met Your Mother,21,5
14960,Marshall,5," I don't think you need to be. I was at that party. It was dark, and granted, I had eaten quite a few sandwiches but I'm a hundred percent sure that unreasonably-small-mouth-opening girl was Alexa Leskies, it's not Lily.",3,How I Met Your Mother,220,39

16023,Robin,9, Come on.,3,How I Met Your Mother,9,2

16121,Marshall,9," Well, then, I'd like to say something. If that's cool? Um... today, Lily did something great. Not only did she gather us all here together and cook a delicious meal, but she also started a new tradition. We're gonna do this again next year, and the year after that... maybe for the rest of our lives. I think that's pretty amazing if you think about it. And it's all thanks to you,Lily. I love you. So, to the first of many Thanksgivings together.",3,How I Met Your Mother,448,83

16543,Barney,11," You've heard of the golden rule, right? ""love their neighbor?""",3,How I Met Your Mother,63,10
16544,Ted,11," uh, actually, it's ""do unto others as you would have them do unto you."" It's from the bible.",3,How I Met Your Mother,93,18
16545,Barney,11," Damn it Ted, i've worked out this whole thing where the golden rule is ""love thy neighbor"", ok?... Now the golden rule is ""love thy neigbor"". But, there's one rule above it",3,How I Met Your Mother,173,32

16551,Barney,11," good, then we've got a solid half hour. And in that time, we will convince you not to set foot out that door. It's a story older than time, my friend, and it always plays out in the same eight steps. Step 1",3,How I Met Your Mother,207,43
16553,Barney,11, It's true.,3,How I Met Your Mother,11,2

16572,Barney,11, The attraction is instant and undeniable.,3,How I Met Your Mother,42,6
16574,Barney,11," But you know better. You've seen your friends make the same mistakes before. You've laughed smugly at them. Idiots! But still, you think, ""this is different. The platinum rule doesn't apply to me."" And that step 2! Bargaining.",3,How I Met Your Mother,227,38
16576,Robin,11, I think i've got a little crush on our sports guy.,3,How I Met Your Mother,51,11

16584,Lily,11, we're not gonna date them. We're just gonna be friends with them.,3,How I Met Your Mother,66,12
16585,Barney,11, That's the couples version of dating.,3,How I Met Your Mother,38,6
16586,Robin,11," And you've got the couples version of the hots for them. Oh, yeah, you want to browse at pottery barn with them. You want to go antiquing with them, don't you? Oh, yeah, you want to antique the crap out of them.",3,How I Met Your Mother,212,42

16631,Ted,11," See, i bet you didn't pay for that gin and tonic.",3,How I Met Your Mother,50,11
16632,Barney,11," oh, i paid for it.",3,How I Met Your Mother,19,5
16633,Ted,11," But you got to admit, there is an upside to breaking the platinum rule. Like maybe as her boyfrien, i could get a discount on treatments.",3,How I Met Your Mother,138,26
16634,Barney,11," Oh, Ted, of course there's an upside. At first, that's step 4",3,How I Met Your Mother,62,12

16661,Lily,11, You're killing the bar.,3,How I Met Your Mother,24,4
16662,Barney,11, I'm not killing the bar. Wendy the waitress has seen how i operate in this place. It is perfectly clear to everyone involved that this is nothing more than a temporary fling.  It's fiiine.,3,How I Met Your Mother,189,34

16720,Marshall,11, It's freakin' supernatural. Are they ghosts? Can only we see them?,3,How I Met Your Mother,67,11

16738,Barney,11," And so, inevitably, you have to do the thing you've been dreading all along. Now, a relationship-ectomy is a delicate surgery as it is, but in the case of the platinum rule, it takes a very, very steady hand, and that's step 7",3,How I Met Your Mother,227,43

16793,Barney,11, Yet.,3,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
16794,Robin,11, You're an idiot.,3,How I Met Your Mother,17,3
16795,Ted,11," All right, i'm taking off.",3,How I Met Your Mother,27,5
16796,Barney,11, What?,3,How I Met Your Mother,6,1

If everyone in the world followed every one of your rules, the human race would cease to exist. Yes chances are to Stella and I are not going to live happily ever after the overwhelming odds have it ending badly. And when that happens, it'll be for one of a million possible reasons. But that doesn't mean i'm not gonna try. And when it does fail, so help me god, it's not gonna be because of some rule.  PS",3,How I Met Your Mother,522,100

16805,Marshall,11, Why would she think that?,3,How I Met Your Mother,26,5
16806,Robin,11, Did she see your tattoo and assume you were gay?,3,How I Met Your Mother,49,10
16807,Ted,11," Apparently, there's a rule that says i can't date Stella.",3,How I Met Your Mother,58,10
16808,Barney,11," Exactly, the platinum rule. Stella reads my blog.",3,How I Met Your Mother,50,8
16809,Ted,11," No, this rule comes from the american medical association. Doctors aren't legally allowed to date their patients.",3,How I Met Your Mother,114,17
16810,Lily,11," Oh, sorry Ted.",3,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
16811,Ted,11, It's okay. What are you guys watching?,3,How I Met Your Mother,39,7

17279,Ted,13," No, it's fine. I got to hang out with you on girls' night out. All right, so if you're not allowed to date a patient, I'll just... I'll wait until these ten session are up and then I'll ask you out then.",3,How I Met Your Mother,204,42
17281,Ted,13," Really? I'm getting mixed signals from you. I feel like you've been staring at my ass for quite some time. What, you're married?",3,How I Met Your Mother,129,23
17283,Ted,13, Boyfriend?,3,How I Met Your Mother,11,1

17287,Ted,13, Only date black guys?,3,How I Met Your Mother,22,4

17292,Robin,13," No... Hmm. What could she mean when she says 'no'? I don't know, it is totally cryptic.",3,How I Met Your Mother,88,17
17293,Ted,13, This is far from over. We're talking ten weeks from now. Who knows what she'll want then? Do you know what you're going to want for lunch ten weeks from now?,3,How I Met Your Mother,158,31
17294,Marshall,13," Sloppy Joe, shrimp cocktail and a milk shake.",3,How I Met Your Mother,46,8
17295,Barney,13," Ted, do you know how long it takes a woman to decide whether or not she's going to sleep with a guy? 8.3 seconds. After that, her decision is made. She will not change her mind.",3,How I Met Your Mother,178,36
17296,Ted,13, That's ridiculous.,3,How I Met Your Mother,19,2
17297,Barney,13, Is it? Describe your first 8.3 seconds with Stella.,3,How I Met Your Mother,52,9
17303,Ted,13," So we got off to a rocky start. That may be a problem for some guys, but I get better over time. Right? I'm not some Top 40 song... easily digestible. I'm complex. I require time and multiple listens. I'm 'Stairway to Heaven'.",3,How I Met Your Mother,227,43
17304,Robin,13," Wow, Roger Daltrey just rolled over in his grave. That's not the right guy, is it? He's not even dead, is he?",3,How I Met Your Mother,110,22
17305,Lily,13," I think that's great, Ted. You can do whatever you set your mind to. In fact, you've inspired me. I'm going to stop biting my nails.",3,How I Met Your Mother,133,26
17306,Marshall,13," But, baby, you love biting your nails.",3,How I Met Your Mother,39,7
17307,Lily,13," I know, but I'm doing this for Ted. Hmm. God, this is really hard.",3,How I Met Your Mother,67,14

17318,Ted,13, Here's to nine more great sessions.,3,How I Met Your Mother,36,6
17322,Ted,13," Still no. What's up with that? I mean, I juggled.",3,How I Met Your Mother,50,10
17323,Barney,13, You juggled? I thought you were trying to impress her.,3,How I Met Your Mother,55,10
17324,Ted,13, You do magic. How is juggling any lamer than magic?,3,How I Met Your Mother,52,10
17325,Barney,13, Magic's not lame.,3,How I Met Your Mother,18,3
17326,Ted,13, I don't get it. I mean...,3,How I Met Your Mother,26,6

17338,Ted,13, Anyway... I don't get it. She should be into me by now.,3,How I Met Your Mother,56,12
17339,Lily,13," You know, you can do this, Ted. I said that I would stop biting my nails, and kablam-ey. It's just a challenge. It can't be easy to woo someone while you're sticking your naked butt in their face.",3,How I Met Your Mother,197,38

17343,Robin,13," I don't know, Barney. I mean, sometimes persistence pays off. I said ""yes"" eventually.",3,How I Met Your Mother,87,14
17344,Barney,13," No, you didn't. You were like, ""No, we can't, we're friends. It would mess up the dynamic of the group.""",3,How I Met Your Mother,105,20

17609,Lily,14, Why do you guys put yourselves through this? You lose every year.,3,How I Met Your Mother,66,12

17797,Lily,14, So you're not mad at Barney? Don't you want an apology? An admission of guilt? Your truck back?,3,How I Met Your Mother,96,18
17800,Barney,14," Well then, to the last Fourth of July weekend I'll spend getting eaten alive by mosquitoes.",3,How I Met Your Mother,92,16
17803,Lily,14, We ruined their lives. And the worst part of it is that you didn't apologize to any of those women.,3,How I Met Your Mother,100,20
17804,Barney,14," No, the worst part is that we still have no idea who my stalker is.",3,How I Met Your Mother,68,15
17805,Robin,14," Well, that's because you're going about this all wrong. I mean, why chase someone who's following you? All you need to do is go down to the bar, hit on someone, and wait until she turns up.",3,How I Met Your Mother,190,37
17806,Barney,14, That's not a bad idea.,3,How I Met Your Mother,23,5
17807,Robin,14, I'll pretend to be the girl that you're hitting on.,3,How I Met Your Mother,52,10
17808,Ted,14, I don't know. That's a lot riding on a girl who giggles when she lies.,3,How I Met Your Mother,71,15
17809,Robin,14, I do not.,3,How I Met Your Mother,10,3
17810,Ted,14, Have you ever fallen asleep while eating ribs?,3,How I Met Your Mother,47,8
17811,Robin,14," No. Look, I can do this, okay? I mean, how else are you going to find out who this girl is.",3,How I Met Your Mother,92,21
17812,Barney,14, I'm in.,3,How I Met Your Mother,8,2
17813,Robin,14," Okay, here's how it's gonna work. Now, Lily...",3,How I Met Your Mother,47,8
17815,Robin,14,"...she knows what you look like, so just hang out at the jukebox, and don't draw any attention to yourself. And the guys will be in the booth, just pretending to have a normal conversation.",3,How I Met Your Mother,189,35
17816,Barney,14," Talking, we should be talking. Words. Here are words. Why is this so hard? Laughter!",3,How I Met Your Mother,85,15
17817,Robin,14," And then I'll come in, looking hot as all hell.",3,How I Met Your Mother,48,10
17819,Robin,14," I just, uh.... Shh, go away. But come back later. And then Barney will make his move.",3,How I Met Your Mother,86,17
17820,Barney,14," Hey, there, how are you doing?",3,How I Met Your Mother,31,6
17821,Robin,14," Fine, Barney. I mean, um, fine, stranger.",3,How I Met Your Mother,42,7
17822,Barney,14," Wow, you really are awful at this, aren't you?",3,How I Met Your Mother,47,9
17823,Robin,14," Get your hand off my thigh, Barney.",3,How I Met Your Mother,36,7
17824,Barney,14," It's supposed to look like we're about to hook up, Robin.",3,How I Met Your Mother,58,11
17825,Robin,14, You know I'm curious. What do you say to these girls to get them to come home with you?,3,How I Met Your Mother,88,19
17826,Barney,14," Usually I just lean in and whisper this one thing in their ear. You're a little turned on right now, aren't you?",3,How I Met Your Mother,113,22
17827,Robin,14," No. Oh. Look, somebody's watching us. Make your move to the bathroom.",3,How I Met Your Mother,70,12
17828,Barney,14," Uh, I'm going to go to the bathroom now, but, uh, when I come back we'll go to my place and have s*x.",3,How I Met Your Mother,102,23
17830,Ted,14," Dude, dude, dude, look. Blonde girl heading over to Robin right now. We are go.",3,How I Met Your Mother,80,15
17831,Marshall,14, I don't know what to do with my hands. What do I normally do with my hands?  Barney. I brought a copy of the bracket. Which one is she?,3,How I Met Your Mother,136,29
17832,Barney,14, I don't recognize her. She's not on the Top 64.,3,How I Met Your Mother,48,10
17833,Marshall,14, Not even on bracket. Cinderella story comes out of nowhere to win the whole thing. That'll warm your heart.,3,How I Met Your Mother,108,19
17834,Ted,14, Are you okay?,3,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
17835,Barney,14," I don't even recognize her. I don't remember you. I've spent the last two days trying to remember every girl that I've slept with and all the horrible things that I have done to them. And I have done some horrible things. I mean, at one point, I'm pretty sure I sold a woman. I didn't speak the language, but I shook a guy's hand, he gave me the keys to a Mercedes, and I left her there. I'm the guy who keeps a scrapbook of all of the women I have slept with, but I never thought I was the guy who would sleep with a girl and not even remember her. So from the bottom of my heart, for whatever I did to you, I apologize.",3,How I Met Your Mother,622,128
17836,Lily,14," Oh, Barney! Oh, I'm so proud of you. That's not her. I'm so sorry.",3,How I Met Your Mother,67,14
17837,Barney,14, What? What?,3,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
17838,Robin,14," Barney, I'm sorry, that's my friend Sally from work. We just ran into each other.",3,How I Met Your Mother,82,15
17839,Barney,14, So I apologized for nothing?,3,How I Met Your Mother,29,5
17840,Lily,14," Yes, but it was a great apology. And a perfect way to end my scrapbook. I'm going to call this photo ""Barney's Redemption."" Could you stop giving me the finger?",3,How I Met Your Mother,161,30
17847,Ted,15, A new car!,3,How I Met Your Mother,11,3
17848,Barney,15," Ted, this is new york city... You're never gonna drive it. This is a really, really stupid purchase, and I'm sorry, but none of us can support it. Shotgun for eternity!",3,How I Met Your Mother,169,31
17849,Robin,15, You can't call shotgun for eternity.,3,How I Met Your Mother,37,6
17850,Barney,15, I just called it.,3,How I Met Your Mother,18,4
17851,Robin,15," You can't just call things, barney.",3,How I Met Your Mother,36,6
17852,Barney,15, I call that I can call things!,3,How I Met Your Mother,31,7
17853,Lily,15," Hey, baby.",3,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
17854,Marshall,15, Beer.,3,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
17855,Lily,15, Are you okay?,3,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
17856,Marshall,15, Beer.,3,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
17858,Ted,15," Okay, what happened?",3,How I Met Your Mother,21,3
17859,Marshall,15, They always told me that working at a big law firm was like being at war...,3,How I Met Your Mother,76,16
17862,Marshall,15,"...You get out of law school, it's like getting out of boot camp. That first day at work, you're storming the beaches, full of piss and vinegar...",3,How I Met Your Mother,146,27
17864,Marshall,15, Totally.,3,How I Met Your Mother,9,1
17866,Marshall,15, Freakin' briefcases.,3,How I Met Your Mother,21,2
17868,Marshall,15, Totally empty. you?,3,How I Met Your Mother,20,3
17870,Marshall,15, Then you get in the trenches side by side with your buddies. And you feel a sense of camaraderie. But before too long...,3,How I Met Your Mother,121,23
17873,Marshall,15,"...the shells start to fall. Hello, Arthur.",3,How I Met Your Mother,43,7
17875,Marshall,15," Arthur Hobbes is one of the senior partners at my firm, and he's... he's my boss. He seems like a nice guy, but he's got a nickname... Artillery arthur.",3,How I Met Your Mother,153,29
17878,Marshall,15, It's going fine. How is yours?,3,How I Met Your Mother,31,6
17880,Marshall,15," He is, he's in... just in his office next door.",3,How I Met Your Mother,48,10
17882,Marshall,15," You, too.  You never know who's gonna get hit...",3,How I Met Your Mother,49,9
17886,Marshall,15," It was brutal, But the worst was a few minutes later.",3,How I Met Your Mother,54,11
17890,Marshall,15," Yeah, sorry.",3,How I Met Your Mother,13,2
17894,Marshall,15," So that brings us to today. A little background. So I'm working on this report called ""Using 23-b-3 spurious class action precedent to contest a class certification order based on a lack of commonality, numerosity...""",3,How I Met Your Mother,218,35
17895,Ted,15," Dude, you lost us. Can't you just call it something cool like ""the ninja report""?",3,How I Met Your Mother,82,15
17896,Marshall,15," Okay. yeah, fine, whatever. Um, so I'm supposed to turn in ""the ninja report"" yesterday. But I got insanely busy with other stuff, I didn't get a chance to finish it, and then this morning...",3,How I Met Your Mother,192,35
17902,Marshall,15, I gotta go.,3,How I Met Your Mother,12,3
17908,Marshall,15, And then...,3,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
17910,Marshall,15, He screamed at me.,3,How I Met Your Mother,19,4
17911,Lily,15," Oh, baby, I'm so sorry.",3,How I Met Your Mother,24,5
17912,Barney,15," What, that's it? You're upset because a guy talked loudly near you?",3,How I Met Your Mother,68,12
17913,Marshall,15," Barney, I have never been screamed at like that in my life.",3,How I Met Your Mother,60,12
17914,Ted,15," Come on, when's the last time you got screamed at at work?",3,How I Met Your Mother,59,12
17915,Barney,15," I got screamed at three times today. Once in Korean. This is corporate America, Marshall. Screaming is a motivational tool, like christmas bonuses or sexual harassment. It's just good business.",3,How I Met Your Mother,194,30
17916,Lily,15," Oh, baby, it's just not fair. You've been working so hard. Late nights, weekends. I never see you. We've barely made love in weeks. It's bad, guys, mama needs her sugar.",3,How I Met Your Mother,170,31
17917,Robin,15," Look, Marshall, he screamed at you, you took it. He probably respects you more for it.",3,How I Met Your Mother,87,16
17918,Marshall,15," Yeah, about that... So Arthur's busy giving me the full screaming treatment... Face turning red, vein in his forehead about to burst, spittle flying like shrapnel. Everyone you work with walking by your office, peering in. And suddenly, I just felt all of it.",3,How I Met Your Mother,260,44
17919,Ted,15, All of what?,3,How I Met Your Mother,13,3
17920,Marshall,15," All of it. The fact that I became a lawyer to save the environment, and now I'm working for the bad guys instead. The fact that I am stuck in this job because of a mortgage I can barely afford on an apartment that is crooked. The fact that I am a grown man, and nobody, not even Artillery Arthur, has the right to talk to me like that!",3,How I Met Your Mother,336,69
17923,Marshall,15, I begged my body not to do it. But it was no use. I just... I just...,3,How I Met Your Mother,70,17
17926,Barney,15," Just because you weren't around for this, I called shotgun for all eternity in Ted's car.",3,How I Met Your Mother,90,16
17928,Barney,15, Dude I can't believe you cried in front of your boss.,3,How I Met Your Mother,54,11
17929,Marshall,15," I don't know what happened. There's just something about being yelled at like that, like I was being scolded by my dad. Suddenly... suddenly I was a little boy.",3,How I Met Your Mother,161,29
17930,Robin,15," Is ""boy"" the right word?",3,How I Met Your Mother,25,5
17931,Marshall,15," I felt absolutely powerless. Flaccid... Hell, I... I felt castrated.",3,How I Met Your Mother,69,10
17932,Lily,15," God, you're hot right now.",3,How I Met Your Mother,27,5
17933,Marshall,15," And the worst thing is, tomorrow morning I have to walk into Arthur's office and give him the ninja report.",3,How I Met Your Mother,108,20
17934,Barney,15, Ooh. ooh. ninjas are cool.,3,How I Met Your Mother,27,5
17935,Marshall,15, How the hell am I supposed to face this guy again?,3,How I Met Your Mother,51,11
17936,Robin,15, Here's what I would do if I were you.,3,How I Met Your Mother,38,9
17938,Robin,15," Hi, Arthur.",3,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
17940,Robin,15," Yeah, I got it. Right here. I think it's gonna blow you away.",3,How I Met Your Mother,62,13
17942,Robin,15, So we good?,3,How I Met Your Mother,12,3
17944,Robin,15, Then why are you still in my office?,3,How I Met Your Mother,37,8
17946,Ted,15," Okay, gun violence might be the answer to everything up in Canada, Robin, but here in America, we solve our problems with words. Marshall, you go in and you dazzle this guy with a big eloquent speech defending human dignity. Like abraham Lincoln.",3,How I Met Your Mother,247,43
17947,Marshall,15," Yeah, because it's so easy just to bust out a big, eloquent speech off the top of your head.",3,How I Met Your Mother,93,19
17948,Ted,15, Observe.,3,How I Met Your Mother,9,1
17950,Ted,15, Arthur?,3,How I Met Your Mother,8,1
17952,Ted,15," Justice, sir. You see, we are all born with certain incontrovertible rights, the most fundamentally paramount of which is the right... Wait, you can't be fundamentally paramount. One means highest, one means lowest.",3,How I Met Your Mother,216,33
17954,Ted,15," Human beings have rights, and those rights are, um...",3,How I Met Your Mother,54,9
17956,Ted,15, There are certain justices that cannot or will not be inalienable... as such... for the future.,3,How I Met Your Mother,96,16
17959,Marshall,15," Guys, guys, this is not helping, okay? I can't have some big confrontation with Arthur. I need this job, i... I need the money.",3,How I Met Your Mother,128,24
17960,Ted,15," Yeah, but how good would it feel to walk in there tomorrow, tell him off and then quit?",3,How I Met Your Mother,88,18
17961,Marshall,15," It's great to fantasize about, but nobody ever actually does it.",3,How I Met Your Mother,65,11
17962,Barney,15," Gary blauman did it. Guy I used to work with, the guy's a legend now. We were at the morning meeting and old Blauman was getting reamed out but good.",3,How I Met Your Mother,150,30
17964,Barney,15," Pretty much routine at the morning meeting, but then, on this particular day, something amazing happened.",3,How I Met Your Mother,106,16
17967,Barney,15," Oh, snap.",3,How I Met Your Mother,10,2
17971,Ted,15," Oh, my God.",3,How I Met Your Mother,12,3
17972,Marshall,15, He peed on the conference table?,3,How I Met Your Mother,33,6
17978,Barney,15," Eventually, he just gave up and left. And then his cousin's website tanked. And then he became a janitor at an old folks' home and moved into a one-room apartment above a bowling alley.",3,How I Met Your Mother,186,34
17979,Marshall,15, That's it? that's the end of the story?,3,How I Met Your Mother,40,8
17980,Barney,15," No, no, of course not... he died.",3,How I Met Your Mother,34,7
17981,Marshall,15," How does that help me? How does any of this help me? Can somebody, for god's sakes, please give me one piece of useful advice?",3,How I Met Your Mother,127,25
17982,Barney,15," Lily, control your woman. The lesson of Blauman is that when your boss screams at you, you never scream back. That's why there's a little thing in corporate America I like to call the chain of screaming.",3,How I Met Your Mother,204,37
17983,Marshall,15, Chain of screaming?,3,How I Met Your Mother,20,3
17984,Barney,15," Yes. The chain of screaming starts at the top. Arthur's boss's boss screams at Arthur's boss. Arthur's boss screams at Arthur. Arthur screams at you. You go home and scream at Lily. Lily screams at one of the kids in her kindergarten class. Then that kid screams at her dad, Arthur's boss's boss. And the whole thing starts all over again, Thus completing the circle of screaming.",3,How I Met Your Mother,381,67
17985,Ted,15, I thought it was a chain of screaming.,3,How I Met Your Mother,39,8
17986,Barney,15," It's a circle, Ted, I called it a circle.",3,How I Met Your Mother,42,9
17987,Marshall,15, I don't scream at Lily.,3,How I Met Your Mother,24,5
17988,Lily,15," And I don't scream at my kids, none of whom have parents who work at marshall's firm.",3,How I Met Your Mother,86,17
17989,Robin,15, So it's not a circle.,3,How I Met Your Mother,22,5
17990,Barney,15," Fine! You want it to be a chain of screaming, it's a chain of screaming. I came up with the circle idea halfway through, 'cause I thought it was a more elegant metaphor, but fine, ruin it! You guys always undermine me when I'm trying to make a point, and I'm sick of it! God, I'm surrounded by idiots! Idiots! See, doesn't everyone feel better now?",3,How I Met Your Mother,349,66
17991,Marshall,15," Lily, I need your take on this. What... what should I do?",3,How I Met Your Mother,58,12
17992,Lily,15," Well, what I teach my kids in kindergarten...",3,How I Met Your Mother,46,8
17993,Barney,15," Oh, God.",3,How I Met Your Mother,9,2
17994,Lily,15,"...When dealing with a bully, the most important thing is to be constructive and positive.",3,How I Met Your Mother,90,15
17997,Lily,15," Hello, Arthur.",3,How I Met Your Mother,15,2
17999,Lily,15," I have the ninja report right here. But Arthur, in the future, if you want someone to do their best work, try to motivate them, not with fear and intimidation, but through encouragement, inspiration and respect.",3,How I Met Your Mother,212,36
18001,Lily,15," Oh, you're damn right. You know what I'm gonna do when I get home?",3,How I Met Your Mother,67,14
18003,Lily,15, I'm gonna rip that girl's clothes off...,3,How I Met Your Mother,41,7
18005,Lily,15,...just throw her on the bed...,3,How I Met Your Mother,31,6
18007,Lily,15,...and drive her home like a pack of sled dogs!,3,How I Met Your Mother,47,10
18009,Lily,15," It's bad, guys. Mama needs it bad.",3,How I Met Your Mother,35,7
18010,Marshall,15," You're right, baby, it's about respect. That is the first useful thing anyone's said to me tonight. Can you give me that speech again?",3,How I Met Your Mother,135,24
18011,Lily,15, I'm gonna drive her home like a pack of...,3,How I Met Your Mother,43,9
18012,Marshall,15,"No, the other part, please.",3,How I Met Your Mother,27,5
18013,Lily,15," I have the ninja report right here, but...",3,How I Met Your Mother,43,8
18016,Lily,15," Which of these carpets would look better in the new apartment? I like the color of this one, but this one's so soft. It would feel great on your bare feet......or your bare back, a bead of eager sweat rolling down your trembling bosom.",3,How I Met Your Mother,236,44
18017,Ted,15," Lily, didn't we just go through this with bathroom tiles?",3,How I Met Your Mother,58,10
18019,Marshall,15," Shh, don't say my name. Lily can't know it's me. Just pretend you're talking to Stella. Be all lovey dovey.",3,How I Met Your Mother,108,20
18020,Ted,15," Hey, Stella. Sweetie, how's it going?",3,How I Met Your Mother,38,6
18021,Marshall,15," Not good, not good at all.",3,How I Met Your Mother,27,6
18022,Ted,15, Where are you right now?,3,How I Met Your Mother,25,5
18023,Marshall,15," Right downstairs, come find me. Without Lily.",3,How I Met Your Mother,46,7
18024,Ted,15," Okay, I'll see you soon.",3,How I Met Your Mother,25,5
18025,Marshall,15, I love you.,3,How I Met Your Mother,12,3
18026,Ted,15," I love you, too.",3,How I Met Your Mother,17,4
18027,Lily,15," Wow, you two are already saying the ""l"" word, huh?",3,How I Met Your Mother,51,10
18028,Ted,15, Apparently.,3,How I Met Your Mother,12,1
18029,Lily,15, You hitting that?,3,How I Met Your Mother,18,3
18031,Marshall,15," I'm in trouble, Ted. Ted, I'm freakin' out, man.",3,How I Met Your Mother,49,9
18032,Ted,15," Um... it's a new car, so just be careful...",3,How I Met Your Mother,44,9
18033,Marshall,15," I did something stupid, can we just drive somewhere? I need to get away... just drive, man. Please just drive.",3,How I Met Your Mother,111,20
18034,Ted,15," It's just, this is a really good parking spot.",3,How I Met Your Mother,47,9
18035,Marshall,15, Dude!,3,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
18036,Ted,15," Look, just tell me what happened first.",3,How I Met Your Mother,40,7
18037,Marshall,15," Remember how I said I was gonna give that big speech that Lily told me to give, be firm but respectful? Well, it didn't totally go that way.",3,How I Met Your Mother,141,28
18038,Ted,15," There is a lot of ketchup on that burger. Sorry, what happened?",3,How I Met Your Mother,64,12
18039,Marshall,15," After we all finished talking last night, I went to the diner to finish working on the ninja report.",3,How I Met Your Mother,101,19
18042,Barney,15," Hey, marshall.",3,How I Met Your Mother,15,2
18043,Marshall,15, How long have you been sitting there?,3,How I Met Your Mother,38,7
18044,Barney,15," If you go in there with Lily's kindergarten nonsense, you're gonna get torn apart. I'm here to save your life. you hungry?",3,How I Met Your Mother,123,22
18045,Marshall,15," Yeah, I was just about to order.",3,How I Met Your Mother,33,7
18046,Barney,15, What do you want?,3,How I Met Your Mother,18,4
18047,Marshall,15, A sandwich and gravy fries.,3,How I Met Your Mother,28,5
18049,Barney,15," A green tea with lemon for me, and for my friend here, the meatloaf, please.",3,How I Met Your Mother,77,15
18051,Marshall,15," No, I didn't want meatloaf.",3,How I Met Your Mother,28,5
18052,Barney,15," Marshall, the chain of screaming is a real thing. Arthur screamed at you... now you have to scream at someone else.",3,How I Met Your Mother,116,21
18053,Marshall,15," No, I don't.",3,How I Met Your Mother,13,3
18054,Barney,15," Yes, you do, or else that anger is gonna eat you alive.",3,How I Met Your Mother,56,12
18055,Marshall,15, Who would I even scream at?,3,How I Met Your Mother,28,6
18056,Barney,15, I don't know. How about somebody who's disappointed you? Someone who's let you down. Someone who's gonna bring you meatloaf when you explicitly ordered a sandwich and gravy fries.,3,How I Met Your Mother,180,29

18338,Lily,16, Oh. One example of that springs to mind. I think we all know what it is.,3,How I Met Your Mother,73,16

18355,Ted,16, No reason.,3,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
18356,Marshall,16," Robin, the point is, what are you doing? I mean, this guy?",3,How I Met Your Mother,59,12

18360,Lily,16, I don't know. Is there any version where you don't sound like a 16-year-old?,3,How I Met Your Mother,77,14
18361,Robin,16, That's exactly what my mom would say.,3,How I Met Your Mother,38,7

18405,Barney,16," Robin, that is the stupidest thing I've ever heard come out of your mouth. You want to be 16 again? I have watched your first Robin Sparkles video 1,000 times, and it's not because I'm proud of you as a friend. It's because you were totally, totally lame back then. But now, come on. Pa-cow! You're the most awesome person I have ever known. Well, second most awesome.",3,How I Met Your Mother,369,68
18406,Robin,16," Right. Of course, the-the first being you.",3,How I Met Your Mother,43,7
18407,Barney,16, No. No. The first is this guy who lives in a place called the mirror. What up?! I'm saying that you are way more awesome than Simon ever will be.,3,How I Met Your Mother,146,30
18408,Robin,16," Barney, do you want to come back to my place?",3,How I Met Your Mother,46,10

18411,Barney,16, Are you sure you want to do this?,3,How I Met Your Mother,34,8
18412,Robin,16," Yeah. I am. Let's just not tell anyone about this, okay?",3,How I Met Your Mother,57,11
18413,Barney,16," Of course. So, should I just put it in?",3,How I Met Your Mother,40,9
18414,Robin,16," Yeah, why not?",3,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
18416,Robin,16," This was my big artistic follow-up to""Let's Go to the Mall."" It kind of tanked.",3,How I Met Your Mother,80,15
18417,Barney,16, Is that Tiffany? Mm-hmm. You are so rad. It's everything I want it to be and more.,3,How I Met Your Mother,83,17

18420,Robin,16, Yeah.,3,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
18421,Barney,16," You know, if you reedit it, there's a tampon commercial in here somewhere. Do you seem how lame you were back then?",3,How I Met Your Mother,116,22
18422,Robin,16," Yeah, you're right. I was lame.",3,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
18423,Barney,16," Totally lame. Ugh. And, of course, the robot makes an appearance in the sad love ballad.",3,How I Met Your Mother,89,16
18424,Robin,16, He was my sidekick. He had to be.,3,How I Met Your Mother,34,8
18428,Barney,17," In my experience, the way this normally goes is, we lie here for a while, make a little awkward chitchat.",3,How I Met Your Mother,106,20
18429,Robin,17, Check.,3,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
18430,Barney,17," Then I make up some cabinet meeting, heart surgery, rocket test flight I've got to be at, slip out of the apartment and never call you again.",3,How I Met Your Mother,142,27
18431,Robin,17," And later at the bar, you tell your good friend Robin the story of your latest conquest, and she thinks to herself, ""who is this sad, self-loathing idiot who climbed into bed with Barney Stinson?""",3,How I Met Your Mother,197,35
18432,Barney,17," Actually, you usually say that out loud. So...I just slept with my best friend's ex-girlfriend",3,How I Met Your Mother,95,15
18433,Robin,17, And I just slept with my ex-boyfriend's really good friend.,3,How I Met Your Mother,60,10
18434,Barney,17, Best friend.,3,How I Met Your Mother,13,2
18435,Robin,17," Okay, here's the deal, Barney. The second my feet touch the ground, this never happened.",3,How I Met Your Mother,89,15
18436,Barney,17," Okay. Wait. Right click, save as... Into the.bpeg folder, and okay. This never happened. It's a good plan.",3,How I Met Your Mother,107,18
18437,Robin,17, Now we go back to exactly the way things were before.,3,How I Met Your Mother,54,11
18438,Barney,17," Okay. Right. So, Robin?",3,How I Met Your Mother,24,4
18439,Robin,17," Yes, Barney?",3,How I Met Your Mother,13,2
18440,Barney,17, Guess who nailed the chick from metro news one last night?,3,How I Met Your Mother,59,11
18442,Robin,17," I'm gonna shower... till June, and, um, since you were never here to begin with, you won't be here when I get out.",3,How I Met Your Mother,115,23
18443,Barney,17, Okay. This never happened. Never happened. Never... happened.,3,How I Met Your Mother,62,8
18446,Ted,17," So, tell us, what was it like?",3,How I Met Your Mother,31,7
18447,Barney,17, What?,3,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
18448,Ted,17," Penetrating that barrier. You and I are the first ones to hit it. Well, not the first ones, certainly, but the first ones at this table.",3,How I Met Your Mother,137,26
18449,Barney,17, I... I... I'm... I'm...,3,How I Met Your Mother,24,4
18450,Marshall,17," Although, I'm gonna be hitting it pretty soon.",3,How I Met Your Mother,47,8
18451,Robin,17," Yeah, you are.",3,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
18452,Marshall,17," Yeah, and when I hit it, I'm going to go nuts.",3,How I Met Your Mother,47,11
18453,Lily,17," It's gonna be all night, and I think I want a clown there. I'm a little bit scared of clowns, but for you, I'm there.",3,How I Met Your Mother,118,25
18454,Barney,17, What are you talking about?!,3,How I Met Your Mother,29,5
18455,Ted,17," The big three-oh. You know, my 30th birthday's this friday. Did you forget? What kind of friend is this guy?",3,How I Met Your Mother,109,20
18456,Barney,17," Ha-ha right. A great friend, by the way. The best. Is it my imagination, or are these drinks getting smaller? If this were a doctor's office, they'd say, ""try again."" How you doing there, Robin?",3,How I Met Your Mother,195,35
18457,Robin,17, I'm good.,3,How I Met Your Mother,10,2
18458,Ted,17," Oh, so, I made a a decision. I'm going to go through all my old stuff, And I'm getting rid of anything I have no use for anymore. Hmm. Barney, you want my xbox?",3,How I Met Your Mother,161,34

18462,Barney,17, I'll come with you.,3,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
18463,Robin,17, Okay.,3,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
18464,Barney,17," God, this is awkward.",3,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
18465,Robin,17, What is?,3,How I Met Your Mother,9,2
18466,Barney,17, Being around Ted.,3,How I Met Your Mother,18,3
18467,Robin,17, Why?,3,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
18468,Barney,17, Because of our thing.,3,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
18469,Robin,17, What thing?,3,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
18470,Barney,17, You're really gonna pretend this never happened?,3,How I Met Your Mother,49,7
18472,Ted,17, What never happened? What are you guys talking about?,3,How I Met Your Mother,54,9
18473,Robin,17, Nothing.,3,How I Met Your Mother,9,1

18480,Marshall,17," Yeah, I'm kind of real focused on the job hunt right now.",3,How I Met Your Mother,58,12
18481,Barney,17, I know. I want to hire you.,3,How I Met Your Mother,28,7

18483,Barney,17, I need a lawyer. I'll pay you.,3,How I Met Your Mother,31,7
18484,Marshall,17, How much?,3,How I Met Your Mother,10,2
18485,Barney,17, A little.,3,How I Met Your Mother,10,2
18486,Marshall,17, I'll take it.,3,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
18488,Marshall,17," Hey. so, I'm reading this, and, I got to say, this might be a little bit over my head. For one thing, I'm fairly certain that if these contracts aren't executed precisely, we will be at war with Portugal.",3,How I Met Your Mother,205,39
18489,Barney,17," Forget that. That's a Tuesday for me. New shredder. This baby'll chew up a bicycle in 17 seconds. From sky mall. It's all from sky mall. Whenever I get upset, I shop at sky mall. Want a hot dog?",3,How I Met Your Mother,195,39
18490,Marshall,17, Of course. Why are you upset?,3,How I Met Your Mother,30,6

18494,Marshall,17, You slept with Robin?,3,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
18495,Barney,17, Are you mad at me?,3,How I Met Your Mother,19,5
18496,Marshall,17, I don't know.,3,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
18497,Barney,17, How's the hot dog?,3,How I Met Your Mother,19,4
18498,Marshall,17," It's helping. You slept with Robin?! I... I cannot keep that secret. I mean, you know I at least have to tell Lily.",3,How I Met Your Mother,116,23
18499,Barney,17, You can't. you can't tell anyone. Attorney-client privilege.,3,How I Met Your Mother,61,8
18500,Marshall,17, Why are you doing this to me?!,3,How I Met Your Mother,31,7
18501,Barney,17," Because I need you, Marshall, as my lawyer, to prove that I didn't do anying wrong.",3,How I Met Your Mother,84,16
18502,Marshall,17," How can I help you as your lawyer? You didn't break any laws, did you? Robin knows you slept with her, doesn't she?",3,How I Met Your Mother,116,23
18503,Barney,17," I didn't break any state or federal laws, but I think I broke a much, much higher law. The Bro Code.",3,How I Met Your Mother,101,21

18512,Marshall,17, This is not a legal docume.. This is just something you wrote.,3,How I Met Your Mother,63,12
18513,Barney,17," You think I wrote that? Oh, Marshall, don't you know the glorious history of the Bro Code?",3,How I Met Your Mother,91,17
18516,Barney,17, The year was 1776. The place,3,How I Met Your Mother,29,6
18522,Barney,17, I shall write this set of rules. And I shall inscribe it on theacack of the Constitution. To save paper.,3,How I Met Your Mother,105,20
18524,Barney,17," And I shall l include a provision that stateth ""No eye contact in a devil's three-way.""",3,How I Met Your Mother,88,16
18528,Marshall,17," Listen, what do you want me for?",3,How I Met Your Mother,33,7
18529,Barney,17," I've just been losing my mind lately, and do you know why I feel so bad?",3,How I Met Your Mother,73,16
18530,Marshall,17," Yeah, because you slept with Robin.",3,How I Met Your Mother,36,6
18531,Barney,17," No, that was awesome. I feel bad because the Bro Code clearly states ""No s*x with your bro's ex."" But if you, my lawyer,can find a loophole somewhere, then that bad feeling will go bye-bye.",3,How I Met Your Mother,190,35
18532,Marshall,17, And you would pay me for that?,3,How I Met Your Mother,31,7
18533,Barney,17," No, I'll just be the one shredding your paperwork. Technically, you'll be paid by a toy factory in Pyongyang.",3,How I Met Your Mother,110,19
18534,Marshall,17," Barney, I'm no shrink, okay, but don't you see that this is just a desperate way for you to avoid an unpleasant confrontation with Ted?",3,How I Met Your Mother,136,25
18535,Barney,17," Hey, if I wanted a psychological evaluation, I'd hire the guy we pay to hint notize us before depositions. Now, get cracking!",3,How I Met Your Mother,126,22
18538,Lily,17," And with a little luck, in a few days, Farmer Frank's cold will be all gone. And that's why Farmer Frank's breath smells like medicine. Right, Farmer Frank?",3,How I Met Your Mother,157,28
18540,Lily,17, Any last questions for Farmer Frank? Yes.,3,How I Met Your Mother,42,7

18554,Ted,17, How'd you know that was a goat turd?,3,How I Met Your Mother,37,8
18555,Robin,17," Well, it was either that, or a musk ox turd, and I figured,what the hell would a musk ox be doing in here?",3,How I Met Your Mother,107,23
18556,Ted,17, Hey. Guess what your wife brought home.,3,How I Met Your Mother,40,7
18557,Marshall,17, Attorney-client privilege.I can't talk about it.,3,How I Met Your Mother,49,6
18558,Ted,17, Talk about what?,3,How I Met Your Mother,17,3
18559,Marshall,17," Nothing. How was your day? Oh, goat turd on the floor,I see. Is that new?",3,How I Met Your Mother,74,15
18560,Ted,17, How does everyone know that's a goat turd?,3,How I Met Your Mother,43,8
18561,Robin,17, Barney told you.,3,How I Met Your Mother,17,3
18562,Marshall,17," I don't know what you're talking about,madam.",3,How I Met Your Mother,46,7

18564,Ted,17," Robin, come here!",3,How I Met Your Mother,18,3

18569,Barney,17," Fantastic, you're here. Give me the good news.",3,How I Met Your Mother,47,8
18570,Marshall,17, I'm sorry. You did too good of a job writing this thing. It's-it's iron-clad.,3,How I Met Your Mother,78,14
18571,Barney,17," No! Bad lawyer! I need a loophole! I want to feel better, Marshall! I can't keep buying things! I have six self-cleaning litterboxes and I don't even have a kid. Wait. How about this? Ted's probably broken this thing himself, right? And if he's broken the Bro Code, then I'm off the hook.",3,How I Met Your Mother,289,53
18572,Marshall,17," I thought about that. And I gotta say, Ted has upheld this thing time and time again. For example, article 87",3,How I Met Your Mother,110,21

18674,Ted,17," You think that this is just about Robin? This is about... You know, I've seen you do some bad stuff. I mean some really terrible stuff to a lot of different people. I just always thought there had to be a limit. I always thought I was the limit. You're always spouting off these rules for bros.

18679,Barney,17, Are you saying you don't want to be bros anymore?,3,How I Met Your Mother,50,10
18680,Ted,17, I'm saying I don't want to be friends anymore.,3,How I Met Your Mother,47,9

19714,Ted,1, My dad took me to an old drive-in to see the original Star Wars.,4,How I Met Your Mother,65,14
19717,Marshall,1," She's never seen Star Wars?! Ted, the only people in the universe who haven't seen Star Wars are the characters, and that's 'cause they lived them. That's 'cause they lived theStar Wars.",4,How I Met Your Mother,187,32

19732,Barney,1, Why?,4,How I Met Your Mother,5,1

19735,Lily,1, We both know you're more than that. Show Robin the Barney I met the other day.,4,How I Met Your Mother,79,16
19736,Barney,1," You mean the insecure, touchy-feely she-male who sounded alarmingly close to Ted?",4,How I Met Your Mother,82,12
19737,Lily,1, Ted hit that for over a year.,4,How I Met Your Mother,30,7
19738,Barney,1, Wish me luck.,4,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
19740,Ted,1," I just thought it'd be fun to watch a movie tonight, and since you've never seen Star Wars, I figured why not? No big deal. It's pretty good.",4,How I Met Your Mother,142,28
19742,Ted,1," The movie's already started, so...",4,How I Met Your Mother,35,5

19777,Barney,1, Thanks.,4,How I Met Your Mother,8,1
19778,Robin,1, Nothing? Not even a glance? Even I was thinking about rocking a motorboat on those bad boys. What the hell is wrong with you?,4,How I Met Your Mother,126,24
19779,Barney,1," I don't always want to be that guy. Sometimes I want to be someone you can have an actual conversation with. Now, tell me something about you that I don't know yet. Seriously.",4,How I Met Your Mother,176,33
19780,Robin,1," There's a job opening at a new cable network that would be perfect for me... completely legit world news, interviews with people who matter... but I decided I'm not going to apply.",4,How I Met Your Mother,181,32
19781,Barney,1, Why not?,4,How I Met Your Mother,9,2
19782,Robin,1, Because I'm a joke. I'm just the scary news lady from some stupid local news channel.,4,How I Met Your Mother,86,16

19792,Marshall,1, I'll tell her you still want to be friends.,4,How I Met Your Mother,44,9

19800,Robin,1," Yeah, why not? Hold that thought?",4,How I Met Your Mother,34,6
19804,Ted,1, Yes! I am marrying a woman who is not only hot but loves Star Wars. That's the dream.,4,How I Met Your Mother,86,18

19810,Marshall,1, Wookiee.,4,How I Met Your Mother,9,1
19812,Marshall,1," He's a Wookiee, and his kind is actually more intelligent than they appear. That is Ted's favorite movie of all time. He watches it when he's home sick with the flu. He watches it on rainy Sunday afternoons in the fall. He watches it on Christmas Eve. Ted watches Star Wars in sickness and in health, in good times and in bad. Do you really think that you can pretend to like a movie that you actually hate for the rest of your life?",4,How I Met Your Mother,434,84
19814,Marshall,1," Then, Ted's a lucky guy. Bear.",4,How I Met Your Mother,31,6

19818,Barney,1, Would you excuse us for one sec? What are you doing?,4,How I Met Your Mother,53,11
19819,Robin,1," You were so nice to me tonight, I wanted to return the favor, wingwoman-style. So, as I was saying, Barney is the Yankees' new second-baseman. And Barney, April asked if tomorrow, you could hit a goal for her during the baseball match. You can't make this stuff up. So, you two kids have fun.",4,How I Met Your Mother,293,54
19821,Barney,1," Yeah, I'm nervous for the other team 'cause when I step up to that plate... I am not a New York Yankee. Any other night, I would probably try to convince you that I am, but I'm not. I'm just some guy who's in love with the girl that just left, and she's never going to feel the same way. So I'm just going to go.",4,How I Met Your Mother,313,66
19823,Barney,1, And that was it.,4,How I Met Your Mother,17,4
19824,Lily,1," I'm so sorry, Barney. You can't give up. You know, it may take some time, but once Robin sees the new you...",4,How I Met Your Mother,109,22

19828,Barney,1, I choose bimbos.,4,How I Met Your Mother,17,3
19829,Lily,1, What?,4,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
19830,Barney,1," Bimbos make me happy. Bimbos make me feel alive. Bimbos make me want to pretend to be a better man. This whole thing with Robin was just a fling, but at the end of the day, my heart belongs to bimbos.",4,How I Met Your Mother,201,41
19831,Lily,1," This is just a defense mechanism, because you're afraid of getting hurt. You're just confused.",4,How I Met Your Mother,95,15
19832,Barney,1," Oh, I'm not confused. You know who is confused? Bimbos. They're easily confused. It's one of the thousand little things I love about them. I love their vacant, trusting stares, their sluggish, unencumbered minds, their unresolved daddy issues. I love them and they love me. Bimbos have always been there for me, through thick and thin. Mostly thin. B- man don't do thick crust. What up?",4,How I Met Your Mother,387,66
19833,Lily,1," See you, Barney.",4,How I Met Your Mother,17,3

19838,Barney,2," Our company just bought them out in a ruthless takeover. Took two months. Cost 2,000 jobs. It was brutal. Who wants a T-shirt?  Hey, Marshall, they're hiring in the legal department. I could get you a job.",4,How I Met Your Mother,206,37
19839,Lily,2," Barney, Marshall didn't quit his last soul-sucking corporate job just to go work at a bank. He's gonna be an environmental lawyer.",4,How I Met Your Mother,131,22
19841,Marshall,2," You are confident, you are energetic, you are focused!",4,How I Met Your Mother,55,9
19843,Marshall,2," You are flexible on salary, you're willing to compromise, you're not gonna cry this time.",4,How I Met Your Mother,90,15

19848,Ted,2," So, what do you guys want to do for dinner?",4,How I Met Your Mother,44,10
19850,Robin,2," Great, we'll take five of those.",4,How I Met Your Mother,33,6
19852,Ted,2, Really? You want to eat here?,4,How I Met Your Mother,30,6
19853,Robin,2," Yeah, I'm freaking starving. I just finished a seven-day cleanse.",4,How I Met Your Mother,66,10
19854,Marshall,2, I thought you started that yesterday.,4,How I Met Your Mother,38,6
19855,Robin,2," I finished early, OK?  Five of those.",4,How I Met Your Mother,38,7
19857,Ted,2, Wait. What about sushi?,4,How I Met Your Mother,24,4

19859,Barney,2, Italian.,4,How I Met Your Mother,9,1
19860,Ted,2, I had Italian for lunch.,4,How I Met Your Mother,25,5
19862,Robin,2," No. We always do this. We spend an hour arguing about where to eat, and we end up here anyway. I haven't eaten for two days. Can we please, for the love of God, just order something now?",4,How I Met Your Mother,187,38
19863,Ted,2, Chinese?,4,How I Met Your Mother,9,1

19865,Barney,2, I don't like Chinese.,4,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
19866,Ted,2, Indian?,4,How I Met Your Mother,8,1
19867,Barney,2, I just said I don't like Chinese.,4,How I Met Your Mother,34,7
19868,Ted,2, Indian isn't Chinese.,4,How I Met Your Mother,22,3
19869,Barney,2," Weird meats, funny music, side of rice. Why are we splitting hairs?",4,How I Met Your Mother,68,12
19870,Ted,2, Mexican?,4,How I Met Your Mother,9,1
19871,Barney,2, I just said I don't like Chinese.,4,How I Met Your Mother,34,7
19872,Robin,2, God.,4,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
19876,Robin,2," Of course, mine comes last. Go ahead, start without me.",4,How I Met Your Mother,56,10
19878,Lily,2," My God. This burger is so good. It's like Christmas in my mouth, meat Christmas.",4,How I Met Your Mother,81,15
19879,Ted,2, It's like an angel from heaven landed in the kitchen at MacLaren's. Where the chef killed it and ran it through the meat grinder.,4,How I Met Your Mother,130,24
19880,Barney,2," I love this burger so much, I want to sew my ass shut.",4,How I Met Your Mother,55,13
19881,Marshall,2, It's okay.,4,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
19883,Marshall,2," Guys, guys, guys. When you've had the best burger in NY, every other burger tastes like my grandpa's feet. But you guys eat up, enjoy my grandpa's feet.",4,How I Met Your Mother,153,28
19884,Robin,2, And you've had the best burger in New York?,4,How I Met Your Mother,44,9
19885,Marshall,2," It was eight years ago, my first week in New York, and for a kid from Minnesota, the big city was a scary place.",4,How I Met Your Mother,113,24
19889,Marshall,2," Oh, thank God it's just you.",4,How I Met Your Mother,29,6
19890,Ted,2," You are being ridiculous.  Tell me, you left the apartment today?",4,How I Met Your Mother,66,11
19891,Marshall,2," Why would I have to leave? I can have anything I want delivered, and New York City cable is awesome. Have you seen this public access show with the old Jewish lady in a bikini?  It's disgusting.",4,How I Met Your Mother,195,37
19892,Ted,2," Marshall, you have to get over this paranoia. You are not gonna get mugged.",4,How I Met Your Mother,76,14
19893,Marshall,2," What if I do, Ted. I don't have a switchblade. I don't know how to break-dance and win the begrudging respect of a street gang.",4,How I Met Your Mother,128,25
19894,Ted,2," That's it, you're taking a walk. Come on, go.",4,How I Met Your Mother,46,9
19895,Marshall,2," No. Look, the old lady in a bikini is back on. I'm just gonna lie back and get comfortable.",4,How I Met Your Mother,92,19
19896,Ted,2," Go outside, go, go.",4,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
19897,Marshall,2, Okay. ,4,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
19898,Ted,2, Leave the bat.,4,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
19899,Marshall,2, Fine.,4,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
19903,Marshall,2," And then, right when I started to get a little hungry, I turned a corner...",4,How I Met Your Mother,76,15
19906,Marshall,2, And there it was.,4,How I Met Your Mother,18,4
19908,Barney,2, Name two places where things get stuffed.,4,How I Met Your Mother,42,7
19909,Marshall,2," So, I went inside.",4,How I Met Your Mother,19,4
19916,Marshall,2," Ted, you got to wake up. Wake...",4,How I Met Your Mother,33,7
19918,Ted,2," Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. Are you okay?",4,How I Met Your Mother,40,9
19919,Marshall,2," I'm all right. Ted, I've just had the most amazing burger of my life! It's this awesome little place, Regis Philbin eats there, so it's sort of like a celebrity hot spot. But the burger. The burger. Dude.",4,How I Met Your Mother,205,38
19920,Ted,2, I want one of those burgers right now! Do you think they're still open?,4,How I Met Your Mother,72,14
19921,Marshall,2, I don't know.  Does stuff in New York stay open past... 9,4,How I Met Your Mother,58,12
19924,Marshall,2, Damn it! Where is this place?,4,How I Met Your Mother,30,6
19927,Robin,2, You couldn't find it?,4,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
19928,Ted,2, We didn't know our way around. Just getting back to the apartment took us three hours and one very helpful drag queen.,4,How I Met Your Mother,119,22
19929,Marshall,2," Wait, Penny Noir was a drag queen?",4,How I Met Your Mother,35,7
19930,Robin,2, Where do you think it was?,4,How I Met Your Mother,27,6
19931,Lily,2, Probably tucked between her legs.,4,How I Met Your Mother,34,5
19933,Barney,2, You know what's not a drag? Getting a home equity loan at Goliath National Bank. I'm just saying.,4,How I Met Your Mother,98,18
19934,Marshall,2," Anyways, we never found the place. Now, eight years have passed, still... No burger.",4,How I Met Your Mother,85,14
19937,Marshall,2," Okay, here we go.",4,How I Met Your Mother,18,4
19939,Marshall,2," No, you don't.",4,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
19941,Marshall,2," Oh, the Corner Bistro! It's amazing, I spent a quarter of my life searching for the best burger in New York City, but silly me, it never occurred to me to check the highest-rated burger in the Zagat guide. Wow, thanks a lot, guy. Let me return the favor. Great cup of coffee",4,How I Met Your Mother,275,53
19943,Robin,2, So I take it you've tried the Corner Bistro.,4,How I Met Your Mother,45,9
19944,Marshall,2," Robin, I've tried every so-called best burger in New York City trying to find that burger. Or at least forget about her.",4,How I Met Your Mother,121,22
19953,Marshall,2, We're going.,4,How I Met Your Mother,13,2
19956,Marshall,2, But none of those places even came close.,4,How I Met Your Mother,42,8
19957,Ted,2," There was that one time we thought we had a break in the case, remember?",4,How I Met Your Mother,73,15
19960,Barney,2, Get this. You know who works out at my gym? Regis Philbin.,4,How I Met Your Mother,59,12
19961,Marshall,2, The autographed picture.,4,How I Met Your Mother,25,3
19964,Marshall,2," That's the one, Mr. Philbin. Do you remember where it is?",4,How I Met Your Mother,58,11
19966,Marshall,2, No.,4,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
19968,Barney,2," No. No, we don't know where it is.",4,How I Met Your Mother,35,8
19970,Barney,2," I don't know where it is, Regis, I swear!",4,How I Met Your Mother,42,9
19972,Barney,2," OK, Regis, we will, we will.",4,How I Met Your Mother,29,6
19974,Barney,2, All right.,4,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
19978,Marshall,2," That's where my story ends. Now I'm doomed to walk the earth forever searching for that green door and that red neon sign that says ""Burger.""",4,How I Met Your Mother,142,26
19979,Robin,2," Green door, red neon sign that says ""Burger?""",4,How I Met Your Mother,46,8
19980,Marshall,2, Yeah.,4,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
19981,Robin,2," I know that place. I've walked by it a million times. It's on West 12th, right off of 7th.",4,How I Met Your Mother,91,19
19982,Marshall,2, I knew it was on a numbered street!,4,How I Met Your Mother,36,8
19984,Robin,2, Finally.,4,How I Met Your Mother,9,1
19985,Marshall,2," No! Robin! If any of us is gonna eat a burger tonight, it's gonna be the best burger in New York. We're going downtown! He throws away the burger.",4,How I Met Your Mother,147,29
19986,Robin,2, No...,4,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
19989,Marshall,2, I cannot believe we're finally gonna have this burger,4,How I Met Your Mother,54,9
19990,Lily,2," Honey, I'm so excited for you. After all these interviews, after all these disappointments, you deserve a triumphant mouth full of meat.",4,How I Met Your Mother,137,22
19991,Barney,2," You know what else is a mouthful? All that double-talk other banks give you. At Goliath, customer satisfaction is our most important investment.",4,How I Met Your Mother,145,23
19992,Lily,2," Barney, I hate to break this to you, but working for a bank's kind of lame.",4,How I Met Your Mother,76,16
19993,Barney,2," How lame is free automatic bill pay? How lame is 3.3% APY online savings? Yeah, that's right. Hate to make you look stupid in front of your friends, but you left me no choice. He laughs.",4,How I Met Your Mother,187,36
19994,Ted,2, We should probably call Regis.,4,How I Met Your Mother,31,5
19995,Barney,2, Reg...  That guy scares me. I think I'll leave him a text.,4,How I Met Your Mother,59,12
19999,Marshall,2," Green door, red neon sign. Guys, this is the place. I've actually, I prepared a few words.",4,How I Met Your Mother,91,17
20000,Robin,2, I will eat your hand.,4,How I Met Your Mother,22,5
20001,Marshall,2,Let's just go inside then. Shall we?,4,How I Met Your Mother,36,7
20004,Marshall,2, Thank you.,4,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
20006,Robin,2," Please, go ahead, start.",4,How I Met Your Mother,25,4
20008,Robin,2, Just shut up and eat.,4,How I Met Your Mother,22,5
20009,Barney,2, All right.,4,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
20011,Ted,2, Oh my god. I'm never brushing my teeth again unless it's with a toothbrush made from this burger.,4,How I Met Your Mother,98,18
20012,Lily,2, I think I just had my first burg-asm.,4,How I Met Your Mother,38,8
20013,Barney,2," I want... to take this burger out to dinner, then maybe a movie, then take it back to my place, put on a little Terence Trent D'arby, and then I would just... fool around a little bit. Nothing serious, just take it slow, you know?",4,How I Met Your Mother,231,45
20014,Marshall,2, This isn't it.,4,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
20016,Marshall,2, It's not it.,4,How I Met Your Mother,13,3
20017,Ted,2," Marshall, you might not want to hear this, but... is it at all possible this is the same",4,How I Met Your Mother,89,18
20019,Robin,2," I mean, it is just a burger.",4,How I Met Your Mother,29,7
20020,Marshall,2," Just a burger? It's so much more than just a burger. I mean, that first bite... Oh, what heaven that first bite is. The bun, like a sesame-freckled breast of an angel, resting gently on the ketchup and mustard below. Flavors mingling in a seductive ""pas de deux"". And then... a pickle the most... playful... little pickle, and then a slice of tomato, a leaf of lettuce, and a... a patty... of ground beef, so... exquisite...swirling in your mouth, breaking apart and combining again in a fugue of sweets and savories so... delightful. This is no mere sandwich of grilled meat and toasted bread. This is God... speaking to us through food.",4,How I Met Your Mother,639,112
20021,Lily,2, And you got our wedding vows off the Internet.,4,How I Met Your Mother,47,9
20022,Marshall,2," Okay, look, so, so this, this isn't the place. All right, it's no big deal. It's another place with a green door and a red neon sign that says ""Burger"". I'll just... I'll call every restaurant in Manhattan and ask 'em what colour their door is. No big deal, right? Let's do this.",4,How I Met Your Mother,280,53
20024,Robin,2, I'm going to go out on a limb here and say this isn't just about a burger.,4,How I Met Your Mother,75,17
20025,Lily,2," Marshall's not doing so well, guys. He really needs to get a job.",4,How I Met Your Mother,66,13
20026,Ted,2, Tell them about the underpants.,4,How I Met Your Mother,32,5
20027,Robin,2, What about the underpants?,4,How I Met Your Mother,27,4
20028,Lily,2, It started a couple of weeks ago.,4,How I Met Your Mother,34,7
20031,Marshall,2, Heads! It's going to be heads. It's almost usually heads.,4,How I Met Your Mother,58,10
20033,Lily,2," Hey, baby.",4,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
20034,Marshall,2, Hey!,4,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
20035,Lily,2, Did you put on pants today?,4,How I Met Your Mother,28,6
20036,Marshall,2, Nope. They laugh.,4,How I Met Your Mother,18,3
20038,Lily,2," It was funny at first, but then it became a daily thing. I thought, ""Okay, well, at least he's not leaving the house like that."" Then, one day, he opened the door to get the paper. Day after that, went downstairs to get the mail.",4,How I Met Your Mother,230,45
20039,Ted,2," Everyone's got an underpants radius. For most of us, it's the distance from the bedroom to the bathroom, but as your self-esteem gets smaller, your underpants radius gets bigger.",4,How I Met Your Mother,179,29
20040,Robin,2, How big is Marshall's underpants radius?,4,How I Met Your Mother,41,6
20043,Marshall,2, We're going.,4,How I Met Your Mother,13,2
20046,Ted,2," Come on, Lily, he'll find a job eventually.",4,How I Met Your Mother,44,8
20047,Barney,2," You know, Lil, when times are tough, I like to remember the uplifting words of my favourite song. He starts singing. ""We'll be on your side when you need a friend. Through thick and thin you can always depend. On the world leaders in credit and banking. Goliath National Bank."" Member FDIC.",4,How I Met Your Mother,291,52
20048,Lily,2, We've got to find Marshall that burger.,4,How I Met Your Mother,40,7
20049,Ted,2," Lily, I think we're all eating that burger.",4,How I Met Your Mother,44,8
20050,Robin,2, I'm not eating that burger.,4,How I Met Your Mother,28,5
20051,Lily,2," No, if Marshall says this isn't the burger, this isn't it.",4,How I Met Your Mother,59,11
20053,Robin,2, Finally.,4,How I Met Your Mother,9,1
20054,Lily,2," Excuse me. Did you guys change cooks or something? Because my husband was here 5 years ago, he's sure he had a different burger. Robin is trying to take the plate.",4,How I Met Your Mother,164,31
20056,Ted,2, What? Uptown? Where?,4,How I Met Your Mother,21,3
20059,Robin,2, Damn it.,4,How I Met Your Mother,9,2
20061,Marshall,2, 106. A numbered street. Of course.,4,How I Met Your Mother,35,6
20063,Barney,2, Barney Stinson.,4,How I Met Your Mother,16,2
20065,Barney,2," I'm sorry, this is...?",4,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
20067,Barney,2," Of course. I'm sorry, I forgot to call you. That's not the place. The real place is on 106th and Manhattan Avenue. We're headed there right now.",4,How I Met Your Mother,145,27
20069,Barney,2, Onions?,4,How I Met Your Mother,8,1
20071,Barney,2," Okay, no onions.",4,How I Met Your Mother,17,3
20072,Marshall,2, Stop the cab!,4,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
20074,Marshall,2, Wait. This is it.,4,How I Met Your Mother,18,4

20078,Barney,2," One of 9,000 convenient locations.",4,How I Met Your Mother,35,5
20079,Marshall,2, It was ri... it was right here. It was... it was right on this very spot.,4,How I Met Your Mother,74,16
20080,Robin,2, I don't understand. Where is the burger place?,4,How I Met Your Mother,47,8
20081,Ted,2, It's not a burger place anymore; it's a Goliath National Bank ATM.,4,How I Met Your Mother,67,12
20082,Robin,2, That's fine. Let's just eat here.,4,How I Met Your Mother,34,6
20083,Ted,2, We can't eat here. It's an ATM.,4,How I Met Your Mother,32,7
20084,Robin,2, But... food.,4,How I Met Your Mother,13,2
20086,Barney,2, What the...,4,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
20087,Lily,2," This is your fault, you and your stupid bank. You did this.",4,How I Met Your Mother,60,12
20088,Barney,2," It's not my... Stop, okay. She hits his knee. Stop that, Lily.",4,How I Met Your Mother,63,12
20089,Lily,2," I will never use a Goliath ATM ever again. Goliath National Bank sucks. It's the worst bank on the face of the earth. Attention, New Yorkers, this bank sucks! They suck!",4,How I Met Your Mother,170,31

20098,Lily,2, But you want to be an environmental lawyer.,4,How I Met Your Mother,44,8
20099,Marshall,2," Yeah and I also want to be a Harlem Globetrotter and get paid in candy, but in the meantime, I need a job, and this is, this is a really good one. It's great pay and there's good benefits, and to be honest, it gives me a reason to put on pants in the morning. You know, I have my whole life to save the planet, but right now I'm kind of really excited to wear pants again.",4,How I Met Your Mother,373,78
20100,Lily,2, You've got great pants.,4,How I Met Your Mother,24,4

20110,Lily,2, I'm sorry you didn't get your burger.,4,How I Met Your Mother,38,7
20111,Marshall,2," It's stupid. I think about that first week in New York. You know? I was 22 years old. I had my whole future ahead of me. I guess I just kind of thought that if I could have that burger one more time and feel that way for one more night, that I might be able to check that off the list, and grow up, go work for the stupid bank, and just... be happy.",4,How I Met Your Mother,350,75
20113,Robin,2, A hundred bucks? That's crazy.,4,How I Met Your Mother,31,5

20127,Marshall,2, This is it.,4,How I Met Your Mother,12,3
20129,Marshall,2," It's exactly the same. It's the best burger in New York. Go ahead, eat up, eat up.",4,How I Met Your Mother,83,17

21098,Lily,6, Why?,4,How I Met Your Mother,5,1

21129,Barney,6, The blue line?,4,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
21130,Robin,6," You know when you're a kid, you give the terms of hockey at all? The blue line is the kiss, the red is to be naked, and I think that ""crease"" speaks for itself. After that, my relationship with my father has cooled. I moved with my mother, let my hair grow, was a Canadian pop star. Young normal stuff.",4,How I Met Your Mother,303,60
21131,Lily,6, You do not think you'd feel better if you talked to him?,4,How I Met Your Mother,57,12
21132,Robin,6," That's just it. It would be useless. This is history, it's done. I would say what?

21153,Marshall,6, You have to get angry. Go ahead. Looking good.,4,How I Met Your Mother,47,9
21154,Ted,6," Come on. There is no question of moving his arms, stomping feet and get angry. This is Stella and I finally communicating. Clearly, it was...",4,How I Met Your Mother,142,25
21155,Marshall,6, Stella hated Star Wars. She lied to you. Seeking your feelings. You know it's true.,4,How I Met Your Mother,84,15

21184,Ted,6," I know exactly what I say.  You chose the wrong guy. You chose the wrong guy. You did a very, very, very bad choice. What were you thinking? This guy? You kidding me? Have you learned anything these past 8 years? You'll be sorry. You know it? You'll be sorry, and you can do anything about it because it is too late. Anything you can do is start up your life miserable and disappointing that will never be as happy as it could be with me. Goodbye.",4,How I Met Your Mother,448,87

22431,Robin,11, This is stupid. Why do you think Canadians are afraid of the dark?,4,How I Met Your Mother,67,13
22432,Marshall,11," Where do prejudices? A stereotype appears, and suddenly, it spreads like fire. Asians misbehave, the Scots are stingy, the Brazilians are too many stamps.

22477,Robin,11," You know what? I'm glad you know it because I am proud to be Canadian. It was not a good NFL team or Prince, but we invented Trivial Pursuit. Anything, the Earth! In addition, in Canada, you can go to a strip club full of alcohol and order. And yeah. Moosejaw in the Bay of Fundy, you can whistle your pint of Pilsner while watching a minor girl to get naked. Jealous? In Canada, people do not care where you come from, as you are whisked away nice and possibly a cigarette, or when a donut. I am proud to come from the ""Great White North""... and I want to be right now. And was not afraid of the dark. Finally, we do not really like, but like everyone else.",4,How I Met Your Mother,659,130

24919,Barney,20, Really?,4,How I Met Your Mother,8,1
24920,Marshall,20, It even tries to sit on the same side for you to sit side by side.,4,How I Met Your Mother,67,16
24921,Barney,20," Really? This is so cute. But let's be clear. I do not like it, OK? It's just that... I miss when she is not there. I think about her all the time, I guess one day we will run towards each other in slow motion and I wear a suede jacket.",4,How I Met Your Mother,236,51
24922,Marshall,20, Tell her how you feel?,4,How I Met Your Mother,23,5
24923,Barney,20," No. Perhaps. Ever. I know not. Listen... I just need to get rid of that idiot PJ. If Lily was there, she would know how to get rid of him.",4,How I Met Your Mother,139,30
24924,Marshall,20, I can perhaps help you.,4,How I Met Your Mother,24,5

24940,Ted,20," There is a history of architecture on a famous architect who designed the library. She was perfect. But every year, sinking a few inches into the ground. Obviously, the building was condemned. He forgot to take into account the weight of books. This box... it's just me. If I ever thought not to books?",4,How I Met Your Mother,303,54
24941,Robin,20," No one goes to the library, so you do not care of this type. And you must pick up the phone and call customers.",4,How I Met Your Mother,112,24

24944,Ted,20," Are you kidding? At 30, I had to have an insolent success, being married to the perfect woman, maybe a kid on the way. Instead, I'm just a guy sitting in his apartment, which is a competition look with his phone. And who loses.",4,How I Met Your Mother,228,44

24966,Marshall,21," Yeah, it's true.",4,How I Met Your Mother,17,3
24967,Barney,21," And not to mention the girls with names ending in I instead of a Y. These girls are like rides. You make the long tail, but once inside, you hold on, hoping not to lose your keys.",4,How I Met Your Mother,180,37

24969,Barney,21, You can not. You must wait three days before calling.This is the rule.,4,How I Met Your Mother,71,13

24971,Barney,21, Sorry. Can you repeat that? I do not mean the I-fuck-ever.,4,How I Met Your Mother,59,11

24973,Barney,21, Jesus.,4,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
24974,Marshall,21," Barney, do not do that. Not with Jesus.",4,How I Met Your Mother,40,8
24975,Barney,21, Seriously. Jesus began this thing for three days. He waited three days to return to life. It was perfect. If he had waited one day we would not have known he was dead! They would have said,4,How I Met Your Mother,189,37
24976,Robin,21, The dialogues seem pompous old now.,4,How I Met Your Mother,36,6

24978,Ted,21," I promise, I'll wait three days. Stop talking.",4,How I Met Your Mother,47,8
24979,Barney,21," And it's Sunday, they are all already in the church.They are all there, ""No, Jesus died."" Then, bam! He burst through the door, crossed the aisle, everyone is excited. And by the way, that's where he invented the ""tope there! ""3 days.We wait three days to call a woman because it is the time that Jesus wants us to wait. True story.",4,How I Met Your Mother,333,62
24981,Ted,21, Okay. I promise. I will call not before three days.,4,How I Met Your Mother,52,10
24983,Ted,21," But I said nothing about texting. I started with something pretty and charming. ""I thought about you, then, I thought you send a text message piti."" By pressing send, I realized that it was not at all charming. That was the thing that sucks the most anyone has told someone. And the worst with texting, is that once sent... can not recover them. And then... you wait. And just when you decided to never again send a text message...  ""I thought you too, it's crazy that you send me a text when I'm in my bath.""",4,How I Met Your Mother,510,96

25990,Barney,1," Okay, look, mistake number 1 was taking that girl's question. You don't take questions on the first day. It shows weakness. Mistake number 2 was you should've hit that. Dude, your pants were already off, you had a classroom full of people to cheer you on, and you can't knock her up 'cause it's a dream. Class dismissed.",5,How I Met Your Mother,321,58
25991,Marshall,1," Mistake number 3, dude, where was the hat? Cause if you're not going to wear it, I'm taking it back.",5,How I Met Your Mother,101,20

26001,Barney,1," Lily, can't you just let us be happy?",5,How I Met Your Mother,38,8
26002,Lily,1, You're not happy. You just think you're happy because you feel happy.,5,How I Met Your Mother,70,12
26003,Barney,1, And that's not happy?,5,How I Met Your Mother,22,4

26040,Barney,1, We're not gonna have the talk.,5,How I Met Your Mother,31,6

26042,Ted,1, I don't think the talk is necessary.,5,How I Met Your Mother,37,7

26050,Ted,1," ""Gremlins""?",5,How I Met Your Mother,12,1

26053,Ted,1, What about brunch? Is brunch cool?,5,How I Met Your Mother,35,6
26054,Barney,1," No, Ted. Brunch is not cool.",5,How I Met Your Mother,29,6
26055,Ted,1," OK, new topic. How do I pick a tie?",5,How I Met Your Mother,36,9
26056,Barney,1, Simple. Remember in the movie Predator...,5,How I Met Your Mother,42,6
26058,Barney,1, I've done all three of those things with Robin. Is she my girlfriend?,5,How I Met Your Mother,70,13

26075,Robin,1," A gifriend's a bit much, Brad, okay?",5,How I Met Your Mother,37,7
26078,Lily,1," Okay, seriously. We're at the point of physical violence. Now, will you please have the talk?",5,How I Met Your Mother,94,16
26079,Barney,1, Because of that? Come on. That's my thing. I'm always punching guys. Girls... I'll punch a baby. I don't care.,5,How I Met Your Mother,111,20

26101,Robin,1, Lily! Come on. Let us out!,5,How I Met Your Mother,27,6

26103,Barney,1, We are not having the talk!,5,How I Met Your Mother,28,6
26104,Lily,1, Then you'll die in there.,5,How I Met Your Mother,26,5

26107,Marshall,1," Hey, guys.",5,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
26110,Ted,1, I still hadn't decided what kind of professor I wanted to be...authoritative or cool guy. I thought I would decide in the moment. And I did. About 20 times.,5,How I Met Your Mother,157,29
26111,Ted,1," Good morning. 'Sup, dudes? Silence! This is Architecture 101. I am Professor Mosby. But you can call me Ted. Professor Mosby. T-Dawg. Do not call me T-Dawg.",5,How I Met Your Mother,157,27

26121,Ted,1," Yes, I was in the wrong classroom. And thus began the most humiliating seven minutes of my life.",5,How I Met Your Mother,97,18
26122,Ted,1, Here's your think-about-it for the day. Every single person in this room... is already an architect.,5,How I Met Your Mother,101,16
26127,Marshall,1, ,5,How I Met Your Mother,1,0
26128,Lily,1, Just hanging out? Not good enough.,5,How I Met Your Mother,35,6

26132,Ted,1, Can anyone here tell me what this class is really all about?,5,How I Met Your Mother,61,12
26135,Ted,1," Don't laugh. He's not... He's not entirely wrong. An architect must be economical in his use of space, so... well done. Looks like someone's building towards an A.",5,How I Met Your Mother,164,28
26138,Marshall,1,"  ""We're seeing where things are going.""",5,How I Met Your Mother,40,6
26139,Lily,1, I'll tell you where things aren't doing... out of that bedroom. Not good enough.,5,How I Met Your Mother,81,14

26143,Ted,1,  You... Why do you want to be an architect?,5,How I Met Your Mother,44,9

26147,Ted,1, No questions!,5,How I Met Your Mother,14,2

26151,Lily,1, Not... good enough.,5,How I Met Your Mother,20,3
26152,Marshall,1,  Not good enough!,5,How I Met Your Mother,18,3
26155,Ted,1," So if any of you have even the slightest inclination to do anything with your life other than become an architect, you're wasting my time and yours. There's the door... You can go. I'm serious. Get out, now.",5,How I Met Your Mother,208,38
26157,Ted,1, Wait... Don't... all leave! Architecture's fun! Look! I brought a hacky sack!,5,How I Met Your Mother,78,12
26159,Ted,1," Sorry, sir. This is... Architecture 101. Who invited their dad, right?",5,How I Met Your Mother,71,11
26161,Ted,1," Euh, yeah, but, I'm sure 200 architecture students and their professor all got the room wrong.",5,How I Met Your Mother,95,16
26165,Ted,1," Kids, out of my way! Sorry. Coming through. Excuse me. Coming through.",5,How I Met Your Mother,71,12
26169,Lily,1, 20 minutes late on your first day? That's rough.,5,How I Met Your Mother,49,9
26170,Ted,1," Yeah, but here's the funny thing. By that point, I didn't have time to think about what kind of teacher I was going to be. I just got up there and talked about architecture. And it was kind of great.",5,How I Met Your Mother,200,40
26171,Lily,1," That's awesome, Ted.",5,How I Met Your Mother,21,3
26172,Marshall,1," Congratulations, buddy.",5,How I Met Your Mother,24,2
26173,Ted,1, Thanks.,5,How I Met Your Mother,8,1
26174,Robin,1,"  Nice job, Ted.",5,How I Met Your Mother,16,3
26175,Barney,1,"  Hey, Ted, door five! Were you there?",5,How I Met Your Mother,38,7
26176,Ted,1,"  Yeah, I got you, buddy.  They still haven't had the talk?",5,How I Met Your Mother,59,11
26177,Marshall,1, I think I know how to speed things up,5,How I Met Your Mother,38,9

26187,Robin,1, Totally. But hum... Where do you see this relationship going?,5,How I Met Your Mother,62,10
26188,Barney,1," I don't know. I mean, it's not like I don't like you. I just haven't had a girlfriend",5,How I Met Your Mother,86,18
26190,Robin,1," Mad? I feel the same way. I suck at relationships. I mean, except with Ted. He really got it right. I know it's a clichí©, but... he really ruined me for other men.",5,How I Met Your Mother,165,33
26191,Ted,1," Of course, I wasn't in the room for this conversation, but I have to imagine",5,How I Met Your Mother,77,15
26193,Barney,1, Maybe we should go back to being just friends.,5,How I Met Your Mother,47,9
26194,Robin,1, Maybe. But hum... I don't want to stop having s*x.,5,How I Met Your Mother,51,10
26195,Barney,1," Good. Me, neither.",5,How I Met Your Mother,19,3
26196,Robin,1, Friends isn't gonna work.,5,How I Met Your Mother,26,4
26197,Barney,1, We're not good at being friends. We're not good at being in a relationship. What are we good at?,5,How I Met Your Mother,97,19
26198,Robin,1, I know something we're good at.,5,How I Met Your Mother,32,6

26200,Robin,1," No,not that. Lying. Think about it. We spent the whole summer lying about being just friends. Why not just keep lying?",5,How I Met Your Mother,119,21
26202,Lily,1, Really?,5,How I Met Your Mother,8,1
26203,Robin,1, Really. We sat down. We had the talk. Barney's my boyfriend now.,5,How I Met Your Mother,65,12
26204,Barney,1," And Robin's my girlfriend. I know it sounds nuts, but it feels good to say.",5,How I Met Your Mother,76,15
26205,Robin,1," We're both afraid of commitment but... the fact is, we also can't live without each other.",5,How I Met Your Mother,91,16
26206,Barney,1," And if the alternative is not being together, then it's worth taking this risk 'cause... she's awesome.",5,How I Met Your Mother,104,17
26207,Robin,1, And he's awesome. He looks nice in a suit.,5,How I Met Your Mother,43,9

26239,Ted,2, Neither did I.,5,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
26242,Barney,2," Guess who just got four tickets to the ""Origins of Chewbacca"" Star Wars exhibit?",5,How I Met Your Mother,81,14

26245,Lily,2,  I heard you.,5,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
26246,Robin,2," Yeah, um, isn't it a little early in our relationship to do something that would end our relationship?",5,How I Met Your Mother,103,18
26247,Marshall,2," What? No, what are you talking about? It can be our first double date as couples! And plus, it sounds awesome! Is the original Chewbacca going to be there?",5,How I Met Your Mother,156,29
26248,Barney,2," Peter Mayhew, in the fur. Who's with me?",5,How I Met Your Mother,41,8

26265,Marshall,2," Thanks, man.",5,How I Met Your Mother,13,2
26266,Barney,2, You're a terrible couple. Lily has taken all the man out of you. I used to think that's just every relationship. But what I've got with Robin proves that you can have a girlfriend and fully functioning male genitalia all at the same time.,5,How I Met Your Mother,239,44
26267,Marshall,2," Okay, right. So, if Robin knew that you were here, she would be completely fine with it?",5,How I Met Your Mother,89,17

26282,Marshall,2, Married!,5,How I Met Your Mother,9,1
26283,Barney,2, What is wrong with you? You're just looking. It's like fantasizing about other women. It's harmless. Wait. Don't tell me you don't fantasize about other women.,5,How I Met Your Mother,160,26
26284,Marshall,2, I do! It's just not that easy.,5,How I Met Your Mother,31,7
26285,Barney,2, False! I once fantasized about that silhouette chick you see on a truck's mudflaps. Took me less than a mile.,5,How I Met Your Mother,110,20
26286,Marshall,2," Not everyone is you, okay, Barney? Even when I do start to have a dirty thought like that... it seems so much like cheating on Lily, that I feel guilty. So first, I need to have a different fantasy.",5,How I Met Your Mother,199,39

26295,Lily,2," No,Marshall, you must. And after an appropriate number of years, you should find someone else. Someone like that busty delivery girl from that one time. And plow her like a cornfield.",5,How I Met Your Mother,184,31
26301,Marshall,2,  This one's for you Lily.  Where do I sign?,5,How I Met Your Mother,44,9
26303,Marshall,2," And then watch out, because it is on!",5,How I Met Your Mother,38,8
26304,Barney,2," That is the saddest thing I've ever heard. Dude, Lily gets you in real life She has no business in your fantasies.",5,How I Met Your Mother,115,22
26305,Marshall,2," It's all I know, okay? I can't, I can't help it.",5,How I Met Your Mother,49,11

26317,Marshall,2,  I'll kill you!,5,How I Met Your Mother,16,3
26320,Ted,2,  Sorry about that.,5,How I Met Your Mother,19,3
26323,Ted,2," Yeah, do you wanna share the oysters?",5,How I Met Your Mother,38,7
26325,Ted,2,  Good. 'Cause if you didn't......that would be mighty shellfish.,5,How I Met Your Mother,65,9
26327,Ted,2, That's why it's funny!,5,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
26330,Ted,2, We've been on this exact blind date before.,5,How I Met Your Mother,44,8
26332,Ted,2," Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think that blind date went too well.",5,How I Met Your Mother,74,15
26334,Ted,2," Wait, you... You dressur cats up in weird costumes.",5,How I Met Your Mother,52,9
26336,Ted,2," Oh, my God. Do you realize what this means? Since our first date, we've done a complete lap of all the single people inNew York only to end up back here, with each other.",5,How I Met Your Mother,171,34
26338,Ted,2," Well, you've got your cats.",5,How I Met Your Mother,28,5

26351,Ted,2," That's right-- the check. The check came and, of course, I was going to pay, but you didn't do the check dance.",5,How I Met Your Mother,112,22
26357,Ted,2," This is good. We're learning stuff. You know what we should do? We should retrace the rest of that night and figure out what else we do wrong on first dates. 'Cause let's be honest, we are scaring people off, Jen.",5,How I Met Your Mother,214,41
26359,Ted,2, Great.,5,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
26361,Ted,2, I think we went to MacLaren's.,5,How I Met Your Mother,31,6
26372,Barney,2, You will not believe who we saw tonight.,5,How I Met Your Mother,41,8
26373,Marshall,2," Dude, um...",5,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
26374,Barney,2, We saw the third doppelganger!,5,How I Met Your Mother,31,5

26389,Barney,2, Busted.,5,How I Met Your Mother,8,1
26390,Lily,2, And there was a stripper who looked exactly like me?,5,How I Met Your Mother,53,10
26391,Marshall,2," Okay, babe, look, before you get mad, let me...",5,How I Met Your Mother,48,9

26402,Ted,2, Not really.,5,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
26404,Ted,2, I'm pretty impervious to stuff like that.,5,How I Met Your Mother,42,7
26406,Ted,2, I couldn't admit I was cold. I didn't want to seem like a wimp compared to your action hero ex-boyfriend who you wouldn't stop talking about.,5,How I Met Your Mother,142,26
26409,Ted,2, I had an aunt in the Coast Guard.,5,How I Met Your Mother,34,8
26412,Ted,2, See? Why didn't you lead off with that?,5,How I Met Your Mother,40,8
26415,Lily,2, Was there a shower on stage? Sometimes there's a shower on stage. I bet stripper me would get in there with another girl and just go bananas.,5,How I Met Your Mother,142,27
26416,Barney,2," See,Marshall? We got to have a bros' night at a strip club and both of our ladies are totally cool with it.",5,How I Met Your Mother,108,22
26417,Robin,2, I'm not cool with it.,5,How I Met Your Mother,22,5
26418,Barney,2, Because they understand that it's healthy for us to do that from time to time.,5,How I Met Your Mother,79,15
26419,Robin,2, It's disgusting.,5,How I Met Your Mother,17,2
26420,Barney,2, Because it's harmless.,5,How I Met Your Mother,23,3
26421,Robin,2, Did one of your whores tell you that?,5,How I Met Your Mother,38,8
26422,Barney,2," And, Lil,Marshall shouldn't have to go to so much trouble just to have an innocent fantasy.",5,How I Met Your Mother,92,16

26426,Robin,2," No, we're not.",5,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
26427,Marshall,2," Lily, Sometimes I think about other women. Okay, it happens. But even when I do, I feel so guilty that I have to imagine you... passing away first, because even in a fantasy world, I could never cheat on you. You're... you're just my life, baby. And I love you.",5,How I Met Your Mother,262,50
26428,Lily,2," You kill me off?! I mean, fantasize about other girls all you want, but could you maybe not murder me?!",5,How I Met Your Mother,104,20
26429,Marshall,2," Murder?! No! I, baby-no. You develop a chronic illness! I spare no expense for your care! I even stand up a foundation in your name. We're, like, this close to a cure.",5,How I Met Your Mother,168,32
26432,Ted,2, Remember? ,5,How I Met Your Mother,11,1
26434,Ted,2, You loved them.,5,How I Met Your Mother,16,3
26436,Ted,2," Let's go in and see what they remember. And they are my best friends, so don't be surprised if they suddenly ""can't think"" of anything I do wrong.",5,How I Met Your Mother,147,28
26438,Robin,2, Did he juggle? Bad puns? Mmm. Expect a standing ovation for picking up a $19 check,5,How I Met Your Mother,83,16

26440,Marshall,2," Well, it is a lot cheaper than buying a condom. Oh!",5,How I Met Your Mother,52,11
26442,Ted,2, Me?,5,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
26447,Lily,2, What about Cat Woman?,5,How I Met Your Mother,22,4

26460,Ted,2," Yeah, well, it's nice to know ""past me"" wasn't a total jackass, huh?",5,How I Met Your Mother,69,13
26465,Ted,2, You got it.,5,How I Met Your Mother,12,3
26468,Ted,2, ...and there's theChryslerBuilding. And the Empire State Building. And at 12,5,How I Met Your Mother,77,11
26470,Ted,2," Good for them. Letting a guy eat pizza off your back, that's love. So, um... I know this wasn't the best",5,How I Met Your Mother,105,21
26475,Ted,2, That was really great. Wh... What went wrong?,5,How I Met Your Mother,46,8
26479,Ted,2," Yeah. So would you maybe, um... want to go out again?",5,How I Met Your Mother,54,11
26481,Ted,2, Absolutely.,5,How I Met Your Mother,12,1
26483,Ted,2, Promise.,5,How I Met Your Mother,9,1
26485,Ted,2, I have been so busy.,5,How I Met Your Mother,21,5
26489,Ted,2," Jen, I sorry. Look, I know I'm seven years late with this call, but I was an idiot back then. You saw the goatee. The truth is, I had a great time tonight, and I'd love to see you again.",5,How I Met Your Mother,187,40
26493,Lily,2," Baby... You should be able to fantasize about another woman without feeling guilty, or you know, killing me off.",5,How I Met Your Mother,113,19
26495,Lily,2," All right, we got to fix this.",5,How I Met Your Mother,31,7
26498,Lily,2," Okay, when Stripper Lily gets out here, you have my permission to fantasize about her. And since she's basically me, maybe you won't feel guilty.",5,How I Met Your Mother,146,25
26499,Marshall,2," Thanks, baby. I'm-I'm so lucky I have you. And stripper you.",5,How I Met Your Mother,61,11
26500,Lily,2, Bring out Stripper Lily!,5,How I Met Your Mother,25,4
26501,Barney,2,"  You know, I don't come here that much.",5,How I Met Your Mother,40,8

26507,Marshall,2, That was a hundred?,5,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
26508,Lily,2," Wow, she crawls fast.",5,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
26511,Ted,2," Look, Jen, I wish I could go back and talk some sense into 2002 Ted, but that guy's a lost cause. He's 24. He thinks a little facial hair makes him look like John Depp. And he has no idea what a great girl he's missing out on. But I've learned a lot since then. I've learned a lot tonight.",5,How I Met Your Mother,290,60
26513,Ted,2," No, it wasn't. I had a great time tonight. And seven years ago, if you think about it, we didn't miss by that much. If a couple things had gone a little bit differently... who knows what",5,How I Met Your Mother,187,37
26517,Marshall,2, Wow.,5,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
26520,Barney,2, You are the best. My girlfriend is at a strip club with me and she couldn't care less.,5,How I Met Your Mother,87,18

26522,Barney,2, Just the best.,5,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
26523,Marshall,2," Hey. Girlfriend trouble? I wish I could help, but my unbelievably cool wife just bought us a private dance with her stripper body double. So if you need me, I'll be getting grinded like some pepper, in theChampagne room.",5,How I Met Your Mother,221,39
26524,Barney,2, Just the best.,5,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
26528,Ted,2, I just remembered why I didn't call you.,5,How I Met Your Mother,41,8
26530,Ted,2," I can't believe I'm gonna screw this up again, but, um... I like finding typos in menus.",5,How I Met Your Mother,89,17
26532,Ted,2, And I know my shellfish pun is stupid but the truth... I'm not suddenly gonna stop making stupid jokes.,5,How I Met Your Mother,104,19
26534,Ted,2," Shouldn't we hold out for the person who doesn't just tolerate our little quirks, but actually kind of likes them? Even if it means finding ourselves on another blind date with each other, seven years from now?",5,How I Met Your Mother,211,37
26536,Ted,2," Well... good luck out there, Jen.",5,How I Met Your Mother,34,6
26538,Ted,2," And kids, when I told your mother that shellfish joke, she did laugh. And I swear, it was only, like, 30% pity.",5,How I Met Your Mother,112,22
26542,Marshall,2," Hey, Lil. Looks like, uh, Jasmine's having a hard time getting out of those boots.",5,How I Met Your Mother,83,15
26543,Lily,2,"  What did you say, buddy?",5,How I Met Your Mother,26,5
26544,Marshall,2, Lily?,5,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
26545,Lily,2," Who? Oh, yes... I am this Lily. We married long time. May I have monies for shopping?",5,How I Met Your Mother,86,17
26546,Ted,3," Kids, your uncle Barney had been called a lot of names over the years.",5,How I Met Your Mother,71,14
26553,Barney,3, Mm-hmm. And yes... we can.,5,How I Met Your Mother,27,5
26555,Ted,3, But there's one name none of us ever expected to hear him called.,5,How I Met Your Mother,66,13
26557,Robin,3," Boyfriend. Barney Stinson is my boyfriend. I've said it, like, a hundred times it still sounds weird to say.",5,How I Met Your Mother,109,19
26558,Ted,3," Well, anything sounds weird if you say it a hundred times. Bowl. Bowl. Bowl.",5,How I Met Your Mother,77,14
26559,Lily,3," But other than that, things are good?",5,How I Met Your Mother,38,7
26560,Ted,3, Bowl. Bowl.,5,How I Met Your Mother,12,2

26571,Ted,3, Bowl.,5,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
26572,Robin,3, That's happened three times.,5,How I Met Your Mother,29,4
26573,Ted,3, Bowl.,5,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
26574,Robin,3," And it's not just that, it's other things.",5,How I Met Your Mother,43,8
26577,Barney,3, Hey. What's wrong?,5,How I Met Your Mother,19,3
26578,Robin,3,"  It was just one thing after another at work today, and then...  I found out my aunt's in the hospital. I'm just, I'm feeling so overwhelmed and it's just...",5,How I Met Your Mother,158,29
26579,Barney,3," Shh, shh, shh. What you need to do is talk through this stuff.",5,How I Met Your Mother,63,13
26580,Robin,3," Oh, thanks.",5,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
26581,Barney,3," And then, once you're off the phone with Lily, I'll be down in the bar ready to have s*x. Mm-kay?",5,How I Met Your Mother,98,20
26583,Ted,3, Bowl.,5,How I Met Your Mother,6,1

26587,Ted,3, Bowl.,5,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
26588,Lily,3," I guess, in a lot of ways, Barney doesn't stack up.",5,How I Met Your Mother,52,11
26589,Ted,3, Bowl. Bowl.,5,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
26590,Lily,3," I mean, you've had some pretty incredible boyfriends.",5,How I Met Your Mother,54,8

26594,Robin,3, I don't know.,5,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
26595,Ted,3, Bowl,5,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
26596,Robin,3, Maybe he just doesn't have it in him.,5,How I Met Your Mother,38,8
26597,Ted,3, Bowl. Bowl.,5,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
26598,Robin,3, Maybe is whole thing's a big mistake.,5,How I Met Your Mother,38,7
26599,Ted,3, Bowl?,5,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
26602,Barney,3, She really said that?,5,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
26603,Ted,3," And she meant it. Trust me. I dated Robin for a year-- if you don't want to lose her, you gotta try a little harder. Be more attentive to where she is emotionally. You know, just be present.",5,How I Met Your Mother,191,38
26604,Barney,3," Yes, totally. Yeah. Only thing, and this is just me--",5,How I Met Your Mother,54,10
26605,Ted,3, Mm-hmm.,5,How I Met Your Mother,8,1
26606,Barney,3," I like my testicles attached to my body, rather than rolling around next to some eyeliner in Robin's purse. Stinson out!",5,How I Met Your Mother,121,21
26608,Ted,3," But then a funny thing happened. Over the next couple weeks, Barney was thoughtful, considerate, sweet. In short, the perfect boyfriend. Which, to Robin, meant only one thing.",5,How I Met Your Mother,176,28
26610,Robin,3, He's cheating on me.,5,How I Met Your Mother,21,4
26611,Lily,3, What?!,5,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
26612,Robin,3, Why else would he buy me flowers? He's gettin' some on the side.,5,How I Met Your Mother,65,13
26613,Lily,3," Oh, come on, Robin. Barney's not the type of guy who would... Go on.",5,How I Met Your Mother,69,14
26614,Robin,3," Plus, he keeps saying he's working late. But when I call his office, they say he left hours ago.",5,How I Met Your Mother,97,19
26615,Lily,3," Well, that doesn't prove anything.",5,How I Met Your Mother,35,5
26616,Robin,3, Yes. Proof. Go word. I'm glad you brought that up. Barney's briefcase. He forgot it here this morning. .,5,How I Met Your Mother,105,19
26617,Lily,3, And what do you plan on doing with it?,5,How I Met Your Mother,39,9
26618,Robin,3," We, we-- you and I-- are going to open it up and look for evidence. Ted probably has a sledgehammer around here somewhere.",5,How I Met Your Mother,123,23
26619,Lily,3, No! Stop! Stop! Eye contact. Listen to me. Robin Scherbatsky is many things,5,How I Met Your Mother,76,13
26621,Marshall,3," Hey, I've been down in the basement storage area going through all the stuff that Lily and I left behind when we moved out. I'm Robin. We should've cleared it out for you much sooner.",5,How I Met Your Mother,184,35
26622,Robin,3, There's a basement storage area?,5,How I Met Your Mother,33,5
26623,Marshall,3," Oh, you're not upset. Good. Baby, guess what I found.",5,How I Met Your Mother,54,10
26625,Lily,3," Oh, that's great, honey.",5,How I Met Your Mother,25,4
26626,Robin,3, What the hell is that?,5,How I Met Your Mother,23,5
26627,Lily,3, Marshall got it in college. He used it as a nightstand for years.,5,How I Met Your Mother,66,13
26628,Marshall,3, Until we found out that Lily was allergic to barrel resin,5,How I Met Your Mother,58,11
26629,Robin,3,  Barrel resin?,5,How I Met Your Mother,15,2
26630,Lily,3, Just go with it.,5,How I Met Your Mother,17,4
26631,Robin,3, So you need a hand throwing it out?,5,How I Met Your Mother,36,8
26632,Marshall,3," No, I'm not... I'm not just going to throw her out, okay? Mabel's like family.",5,How I Met Your Mother,79,15
26633,Robin,3," So, um, what are you gonna do with Mabel?",5,How I Met Your Mother,42,9
26634,Marshall,3," I want to give her away, um, to a lucky new owner. Do you know anyone?",5,How I Met Your Mother,71,16
26635,Robin,3," Yeah, hmm, let me think. Do I know any rodeo clowns? Oh, that's weird, I do. But even Lenny wouldn't go near that mess.",5,How I Met Your Mother,120,24

27006,Barney,4," Ted, it's a poem. Last call was approaching, and my fortunes looked bleak. Then I turned to my left and stifled a shriek. She had a peach fuzz beard and weighed 16 stone. She gobbled up hot wings and swallowed the bones. I muffled a scream and threw up in my mouth.I asked, ""where do you live?""And she said, ""one block south."". I swallowed my pride and six shots of whiskey. And prayed to the gods that she wasn't too frisky. Back in her cave, she prepared us a snack. 'neath her mighty hooves, the floorboards did crack. But when she returned, she found a sound sleeper. And thus she became the sexless innkeeper. And so are you",5,How I Met Your Mother,630,118
27007,Ted,4," Wait, you're saying that girl just used me for a place to crash?",5,How I Met Your Mother,65,13

27025,Lily,4," Wow, Barney. That kind of sounds like the stuff you say to girls when you're too much of a coward to dump them.",5,How I Met Your Mother,112,23
27026,Marshall,4," Yeah. You know, that's exactly what it sounds like. But if that's true, that's awesome.",5,How I Met Your Mother,88,15
27027,Lily,4, What's going on?,5,How I Met Your Mother,17,3

27055,Marshall,4," If I recall, they didn't dump us until you brought up thatVermont trip. It was way too early. First, a boat ride around the city, then a trip toVermont. It's a rookie mistake, and you're better than that.",5,How I Met Your Mother,205,38

27064,Barney,4," To your point, Ted, as an innkeeper. Do you do that cheapy thing where you only change the linens upon request? I mean, I mean, I mean, how much water is that actually saving?",5,How I Met Your Mother,176,34
27065,Ted,4," Robin, you know I'm right. Ignoring a problem doesn't make it go away. Usually, it just makes it bigger.",5,How I Met Your Mother,105,19
27066,Robin,4, You're right.,5,How I Met Your Mother,14,2
27067,Ted,4, Thank you.,5,How I Met Your Mother,11,2

27180,Ted,5," A filthy mecca of spectacular if undercooked pizza located at 316 Kinzie Street, Chicago, Illinois.",5,How I Met Your Mother,100,15
27181,Marshall,5," Back in college, Ted and I used to take these crazy road trips from Connecticut all the way to Chicago just for Gazzola's pizza.",5,How I Met Your Mother,129,24
27182,Ted,5," 22 hours. No map. We'd just jump in the Fiero and drive. We were like Lewis and Clark, if Lewis and Clark peed in empty soda bottles and had a bong made out of a cantaloupe.",5,How I Met Your Mother,174,36
27183,Marshall,5," Man, those Gazzola trips, that's... that's when we really became bros.",5,How I Met Your Mother,71,11
27184,Ted,5, Mm. We ate nothing but jerky.,5,How I Met Your Mother,30,6
27185,Marshall,5, Drank nothing but Tantrum.,5,How I Met Your Mother,27,4
27186,Ted,5," Ah, Tantrum. Tantrum was a soft drink with the highest caffeine content legally available over the counter. It was eventually discontinued after an extensive study by the FDA.",5,How I Met Your Mother,176,28
27187,Marshall,5," Oh, man, we went through a whole case of Tantrum one trip.",5,How I Met Your Mother,59,12
27188,Ted,5, I was color blind for two weeks after that.,5,How I Met Your Mother,44,9
27189,Marshall,5, I think that's the reason that I pass out when I hear church bells.,5,How I Met Your Mother,68,14
27190,Ted,5," It's probably a good thing they're closing Gazzola's. Those trips were brutal, right? The long hours in the car, the motion sickness, the smell.",5,How I Met Your Mother,145,24
27191,Marshall,5, So what time are we leaving for Gazzola's tomorrow?,5,How I Met Your Mother,52,9
27192,Ted,5, I was thinking 9,5,How I Met Your Mother,17,4
27195,Ted,5," I am ready to hit the road. I got baby wipes. I got a variety of jerky. I got six cans of Tantrum. Well, four. One burned though the can, the other one I drank already.  Tantrum! I am so psyched! Marshall and I haven't done something, just the two of us, for so long. Ever since he got married, he's turned from an ""I"" to a ""We"".",5,How I Met Your Mother,330,68
27196,Barney,5, What do you mean?,5,How I Met Your Mother,18,4
27197,Ted,5, Think about it.,5,How I Met Your Mother,16,3
27199,Ted,5," Hey, haven't seen you all week. How you doing?",5,How I Met Your Mother,47,9
27201,Ted,5, Do you watch the Jets game?,5,How I Met Your Mother,28,6
27202,Marshall,5, We most certainly did.,5,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
27203,Ted,5, How'd things go at the doctor?,5,How I Met Your Mother,31,6
27204,Marshall,5, We no longer have a hemorrhoid problem.,5,How I Met Your Mother,40,7
27205,Barney,5, Hmm.,5,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
27206,Robin,5, You guys will not believe this. I've been talking to my lawyer all morning. You know that guy I have a slight disagreement with at the Hoser Hut? He's filing assault charges.,5,How I Met Your Mother,175,32
27209,Robin,5, Come on!,5,How I Met Your Mother,9,2
27211,Robin,5," I broke his nose with a chair. And now, apparently, I may end up getting deported.",5,How I Met Your Mother,83,16
27212,Ted,5," Oh, my God, that sucks! Yeah. I'm gonna go do push-ups in the kitchen. Tantrum!",5,How I Met Your Mother,80,15
27213,Robin,5," Well, there's only one possible way to avoid getting deported. My lawyer said I could become an American citizen.",5,How I Met Your Mother,114,19
27214,Barney,5, Perfect. Problem solved. Welcome aboard.,5,How I Met Your Mother,41,5
27215,Robin,5," Well, it's not that simple. I'm a Canadian. I was born there. My family's there. It's who I am.",5,How I Met Your Mother,96,19
27216,Barney,5," I know, and it's provided us with a lot of laughs. But, Robin, if you want to live here, work here and throw chairs at people here, you have to do this.",5,How I Met Your Mother,153,32
27217,Robin,5," Well, there's a citizenship test tomorrow.",5,How I Met Your Mother,43,6
27218,Barney,5, A cit...,5,How I Met Your Mother,9,2
27219,Robin,5, I'll think about it.,5,How I Met Your Mother,21,4
27220,Barney,5," No, no, you have to do it. I'll help you study. We're gonna stay up all night long. I'm gonna drill you, and then we're gonna study. No, seriously. We're gonna do some cramming and then we're gonna study. No, seriously. We're gonna bone up on...",5,How I Met Your Mother,246,46
27221,Robin,5," Okay, Barney.",5,How I Met Your Mother,14,2
27222,Barney,5, Sorry. It's a rich area.,5,How I Met Your Mother,25,5
27223,Robin,5, It is.,5,How I Met Your Mother,7,2
27224,Barney,5," But you know, it's not going to be easy, this test. It's not like the Canadian citizenship test.",5,How I Met Your Mother,97,18
27225,Robin,5, How do you know the Canadian test is easy?,5,How I Met Your Mother,43,9
27226,Barney,5, It's Canada. Question one,5,How I Met Your Mother,26,4
27228,Ted,5," Yes, I do! I don't why they make phone books anymore. Everything's online, right?",5,How I Met Your Mother,82,14
27230,Marshall,5, Tantrum!,5,How I Met Your Mother,9,1
27231,Ted,5, Tantrum!,5,How I Met Your Mother,9,1
27233,Lily,5," All right, let's hit the road.",5,How I Met Your Mother,31,6
27234,Ted,5, You invited Lily?,5,How I Met Your Mother,18,3
27235,Marshall,5, We most certainly did!,5,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
27237,Barney,5," I don't know if you caught that, but he did the ""we"" thing.",5,How I Met Your Mother,60,13
27238,Ted,5," Yeah, I heard him.",5,How I Met Your Mother,19,4
27239,Barney,5, Okay.,5,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
27241,Lily,5, Road trip! So you guys want to talk about bitches? I'm kidding. They're called women.,5,How I Met Your Mother,86,15
27242,Ted,5," All right, next stop",5,How I Met Your Mother,21,4
27243,Lily,5, I have to pee.,5,How I Met Your Mother,15,4
27244,Ted,5, Couldn't you have gone before we left?,5,How I Met Your Mother,39,7
27245,Lily,5, I did. I just pee a lot. You'll see.,5,How I Met Your Mother,37,9
27247,Marshall,5," Don't worry, we'll get out on the road, it'll be just like old times.",5,How I Met Your Mother,70,14
27248,Ted,5, It wasn't.,5,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
27252,Lily,5," Sugar snap pea? Pea... That reminds me, I have to pee.",5,How I Met Your Mother,55,11
27255,Ted,5," Okay, straight, straight, straight. Now, wait, a little to the left. We'll pass a state trooper.",5,How I Met Your Mother,97,16
27259,Ted,5, Ow!,5,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
27260,Lily,5," Yellow, that reminds me, I have to pee.",5,How I Met Your Mother,40,8
27263,Ted,5, Thank you!,5,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
27265,Lily,5," Great. Oh, hey, Ted...",5,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
27266,Ted,5, You can't have to go again. It's not humanly possible.,5,How I Met Your Mother,55,10
27267,Lily,5," No, I was just going to say maybe we should listen to something.",5,How I Met Your Mother,65,13
27268,Ted,5," Oh, that's a great idea. I think I have some Jerky Boys.",5,How I Met Your Mother,57,12
27269,Marshall,5," Goodbye, Sparky.",5,How I Met Your Mother,17,2
27270,Lily,5, It's an audio book about a boy and his dog. It made Elisabeth Hasselbeck cry.,5,How I Met Your Mother,78,15
27272,Marshall,5, Oh!,5,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
27274,Lily,5," That reminds me, I have to pee.",5,How I Met Your Mother,32,7
27276,Barney,5," ""How many stars are on the flag?""",5,How I Met Your Mother,34,7
27277,Robin,5," 50, one for each state.",5,How I Met Your Mother,24,5
27278,Barney,5," ""What are the first ten amendments to the Constitution called?""",5,How I Met Your Mother,64,10
27279,Robin,5," The Bill of Rights. Look, Barney, I know all this. I'm ready.",5,How I Met Your Mother,62,12
27280,Barney,5," Ready for the test maybe, but ready to be an American? Not on your sweet life. For you to be an American, we got to get the Canadian out of you. That's why I've created these questions. Question one",5,How I Met Your Mother,199,39
27281,Robin,5, Queen Elizabeth II.,5,How I Met Your Mother,20,3
27282,Barney,5," No, the answer is Elton John. Question two",5,How I Met Your Mother,43,8
27283,Robin,5," Oh, curling. Um, it's a sport played...",5,How I Met Your Mother,40,7
27284,Barney,5," Wrong. The answer we were looking for was ""I don't care, it's dumb"". Let's go buy something that's bad for us and then sue the people who made it. That's America, Robin.",5,How I Met Your Mother,170,32
27289,Ted,5," Oh, my God, Lily, please tell me you have to go pee!",5,How I Met Your Mother,53,12
27290,Lily,5," Ah, I do.",5,How I Met Your Mother,10,3
27291,Ted,5," It was the worst trip ever, but then it got worse.",5,How I Met Your Mother,51,11
27292,Marshall,5," Well, don't worry, the next exit's the hotel. We can go there.",5,How I Met Your Mother,63,12
27293,Ted,5, Hotel?,5,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
27296,Marshall,5," Well, I mean, single people can have fun here, too, right?",5,How I Met Your Mother,59,11
27299,Ted,5," And by the end of the night, Barney had turned Robin into a real American.",5,How I Met Your Mother,75,15
27300,Robin,5, I want to say- Jefferson?,5,How I Met Your Mother,26,5
27301,Barney,5, Correct.,5,How I Met Your Mother,9,1
27302,Robin,5, Oh!,5,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
27303,Barney,5, Archie Bunker's neighbor was George Jefferson.,5,How I Met Your Mother,47,6
27304,Robin,5," Oh, boo-ya! I am nailing this. God, I'm buzzing on America right now!",5,How I Met Your Mother,70,13
27305,Barney,5," All right, hold your horses. Now to prove that you are as American as apple pie and the childhood obesity it leads to- who is this?",5,How I Met Your Mother,132,26
27306,Robin,5," That, Barney, is the American actor, beloved by millions, the ""Hey, Vern"" guy from the popular series of Ernest films. And his name... Jeff Foxworthy.",5,How I Met Your Mother,151,25
27307,Barney,5," Jeff Foxworthy? No, it's Jim Varney. You're kidding me. You don't know that?",5,How I Met Your Mother,77,13
27308,Robin,5," Uh, that's Jeff Foxworthy, dumbass. End of story. Now shut your stupid face.",5,How I Met Your Mother,77,13
27309,Barney,5," Not only are you wrong, but you are belligerently sticking to your guns and insulting me in the process. Robin Scherbatsky- you are an American.",5,How I Met Your Mother,145,25
27313,Ted,5," It didn't work, I'm still here. Marshall, what are we doing? We should be on the road.",5,How I Met Your Mother,87,17
27314,Marshall,5," Ok, Ted, we're not in college anymore, okay? We don't have to drive all night.",5,How I Met Your Mother,79,15
27315,Lily,5," Besides, they have a spa. What kind of treatments do you offer?",5,How I Met Your Mother,64,12
27317,Ted,5, And then finally it happened. Marshall and Lily globbed into one big married glob.,5,How I Met Your Mother,83,14
27319,Ted,5, Whoa. I got to dial back on the Tantrum.,5,How I Met Your Mother,41,9
27321,Robin,5," Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be an American, y'all.  Maybe I'll rob a liquor store. Maybe I won't. My choice. Learn English! The Hoser Hut. I could duck in for a drink. No, no, that life's behind me. Forget it. Well, I could in for just one beer. What's the harm in that? It's a free country.  *O Canada Our home and native land...* Oh, God, I miss it. *True patriots love...*",5,How I Met Your Mother,368,71
27323,Ted,5," Hey, man.",5,How I Met Your Mother,10,2
27324,Marshall,5, Shh.,5,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
27325,Ted,5, Sorry about what I said before. You want to go to the store and get some beer?,5,How I Met Your Mother,79,17
27326,Marshall,5, Lily is asleep. I suppose I could reschedule my pedicure. What the hell? But only light beer because we have a couple hike in the morning.,5,How I Met Your Mother,139,26
27328,Marshall,5," Dude, why are we pulling to the highway? Ted, where exactly are we going to get this beer?",5,How I Met Your Mother,91,18
27329,Ted,5, Chicago.,5,How I Met Your Mother,9,1
27330,Marshall,5," What are you doing? We can't just leave Lily. When she wakes up, she's going to freak!",5,How I Met Your Mother,87,17
27331,Ted,5, She'll have a back rub and a crumpet. She'll be fine. Relax. Have some fun.,5,How I Met Your Mother,76,15
27332,Marshall,5, I just abandoned my wife. How am I supposed to have fun?,5,How I Met Your Mother,57,12
27335,Ted,5," Hey, you really think Lily's pissed?",5,How I Met Your Mother,37,6
27336,Marshall,5," If she's pissed, she's pissed.",5,How I Met Your Mother,31,5
27337,Ted,5, Pfft.,5,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
27338,Ted,5," When Barney finally tracked down your Aunt Robin, it wasn't a pretty sight.",5,How I Met Your Mother,76,13
27340,Barney,5, Good morning.,5,How I Met Your Mother,14,2
27341,Robin,5," Barney? Oh, my God. What happened last night?",5,How I Met Your Mother,46,8
27342,Barney,5, You went Canadian.,5,How I Met Your Mother,19,3
27343,Robin,5, How Canadian?,5,How I Met Your Mother,14,2
27344,Barney,5, This Canadian.  Oh. That was supposed to be a dramatic view of the Toronto sky- you're in Toronto.,5,How I Met Your Mother,99,18
27345,Robin,5," Oh, God. Okay. It's coming back to me. I, uh, I went into the Hoser Hut... And I met this women's curling team.",5,How I Met Your Mother,112,23
27347,Robin,5," We started drinking. And the next thing I know, they're inviting me to a Bryan Adams/Rich title double bill in Toronto.",5,How I Met Your Mother,120,21
27349,Robin,5," How did you find me, anyway?",5,How I Met Your Mother,29,6
27350,Barney,5," You called me, said you were never coming back. So, I jumped on a plane, flew across the Atlantic...",5,How I Met Your Mother,101,19
27351,Robin,5, Canada isn't across the Atlantic.,5,How I Met Your Mother,34,5
27352,Barney,5," You're talking nonsense. Now, listen... You slipped up. It's fine. The test is in a few hours.",5,How I Met Your Mother,95,17
27353,Robin,5," Barney, I'm not taking the test.",5,How I Met Your Mother,33,6
27354,Barney,5," God, you're still drunk.",5,How I Met Your Mother,25,4
27355,Robin,5," Look, I appreciate your help, but... who am I kidding? I'm Canadian. I always will be.",5,How I Met Your Mother,87,16
27356,Barney,5," Now, that's ridiculous. We're gonna get some coffee, in you, we'll sober you up, and get you back to New York for that test. But, before any of that, we're gonna do it on this bed 'cause... hotel room. Okay, let's get some coffee.",5,How I Met Your Mother,231,44
27358,Ted,5, Kind of cross.,5,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
27359,Marshall,5, You're making me wonder if this pizza is worth the 22 hour drive.,5,How I Met Your Mother,66,13
27360,Ted,5, Just like old times!,5,How I Met Your Mother,21,4
27361,Marshall,5, I feel so young again except for the chest pains.,5,How I Met Your Mother,50,10
27362,Ted,5, But the crust is so good. What is the secret to this crust?,5,How I Met Your Mother,60,13
27364,Marshall,5, Cornmeal...,5,How I Met Your Mother,12,1
27365,Lily,5, We'd love a cornmeal body scrub!,5,How I Met Your Mother,33,6
27366,Ted,5, I can't believe you guys are closing.,5,How I Met Your Mother,38,7
27368,Barney,5, It's like an entire country without a tailor.,5,How I Met Your Mother,46,8
27369,Robin,5," Yeah, give me two coffees.",5,How I Met Your Mother,27,5
27371,Robin,5, What game?,5,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
27373,Robin,5," Oh, I guess I missed it.",5,How I Met Your Mother,25,6
27375,Robin,5, I'm not American.,5,How I Met Your Mother,18,3
27377,Barney,5, What's wrong? Other than the fact that this five dollar bill they gave you is blue.,5,How I Met Your Mother,84,16
27378,Robin,5," Wow. I'm not American, and apparently, I'm not Canadian either.",5,How I Met Your Mother,64,10
27379,Barney,5, And there's kids playing hockey on the back. It's like you want us to make fun of you.,5,How I Met Your Mother,87,18
27381,Marshall,5, I don't want this anymore.,5,How I Met Your Mother,27,5
27382,Ted,5," Dude, don't look at it. That's a rookie mistake.",5,How I Met Your Mother,49,9
27383,Marshall,5, We shouldn't have left Lily.,5,How I Met Your Mother,29,5
27384,Ted,5," Well, if you're so worried, why don't you give her a call?",5,How I Met Your Mother,59,12
27385,Marshall,5," I have. I left her, like, 20 messages. I said, ""I'm sorry. Please forgive me. It's all Ted's fault!""",5,How I Met Your Mother,101,19
27386,Ted,5," What exactly is ""Ted's fault""?",5,How I Met Your Mother,31,5
27387,Marshall,5," This! This whole thing! We were having a perfectly nice trip, and then you kidnapped me. You didn't even let me, put on underwear!",5,How I Met Your Mother,131,24
27388,Ted,5," We never used to put on underwear! That was the fun of a bro's trip to Gazzola's! We left everything, and everyone behind. It was just you and me! But now it's like you've disappeared into Lily.",5,How I Met Your Mother,195,37
27389,Marshall,5, That is not true.,5,How I Met Your Mother,18,4
27390,Ted,5," It is true. You're not upset because you're worried she's mad. You're upset because you'd rather be with her, eating muffins than here with me, eating this delicious... I think one of my mushrooms just crawled away.",5,How I Met Your Mother,216,37
27391,Marshall,5," Well, you know what? That mushroom's not the only thing that's living. Car keys, please.",5,How I Met Your Mother,89,15
27393,Barney,5," Look at this money! This one has a moose, this one has a beaver, and they all have Elton John on the back.",5,How I Met Your Mother,107,23
27394,Robin,5," When I moved to the States, I swore to myself, I wasn't going to change. And yet, here I am, in the most Canadian place in the universe- Tim Horton's- around the corner from the Hockey Hall of Fame, and I don't belong. It's like I don't have a country.",5,How I Met Your Mother,253,50
27395,Barney,5," Okay, that's it.  Attention, Canada! I am Barney from America. And I'm here to fix your backward-ass country. Number one",5,How I Met Your Mother,121,20
27399,Marshall,5," I'm sorry, ted!",5,How I Met Your Mother,16,3
27400,Ted,5," I'm sorry! No, I'm sorry. I never should have been mad at you!",5,How I Met Your Mother,63,13
27401,Marshall,5," No, I never should have brought lily. She pees all the time, even at the apartment. Still bros?",5,How I Met Your Mother,96,18
27402,Ted,5," Best bros. Hey, you want to crank some Van Halen just like old times?",5,How I Met Your Mother,70,14
27403,Marshall,5," Hells, yeah!",5,How I Met Your Mother,13,2
27404,Ted,5, Or listen to the Sparky book again?,5,How I Met Your Mother,36,7
27405,Marshall,5, Listen to the Sparky book again.,5,How I Met Your Mother,33,6
27406,Ted,5, Okay. Let's listen to it again.,5,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
27408,Barney,5," Man, those Canadian doctors banded me up, reset my jaw, put my shoulder back in its socket, and they didn't even bill me. Idiots. All right, I guess they're no idiots. The coffee was extraordinary. Huh. I guess Canada's not so bad. They play their cards right, maybe they can even become a state someday.",5,How I Met Your Mother,305,55
27409,Robin,5," Barney, I've thought about this. When you stood up and told off those people, I thought, ""Yeah, America's cool.""",5,How I Met Your Mother,113,19
27410,Barney,5, Hmm.,5,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
27411,Robin,5," And then when those guys pounded the stuffing out of you, I thought, ""Yeah, Canada's pretty cool, too."" I may have taken a few pokes myself. So, I've decided, dual citizenship. I'm going to be American and Canadian.",5,How I Met Your Mother,216,38
27412,Barney,5," Wait, you can do that?",5,How I Met Your Mother,23,5
27413,Robin,5," Yeah, dummy. Instead of being a woman with no country, I'm going to be a woman with two.",5,How I Met Your Mother,89,18
27414,Barney,5, I see.,5,How I Met Your Mother,7,2
27415,Robin,5, You understand?,5,How I Met Your Mother,16,2
27416,Barney,5," No, I can see out of my left eye again.",5,How I Met Your Mother,40,10
27418,Marshall,5," Hey, baby? Baby?",5,How I Met Your Mother,17,3
27419,Lily,5, Hmm? Yeah?,5,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
27420,Marshall,5, I'm so sorry that we left you.,5,How I Met Your Mother,31,7
27421,Lily,5," Did you go somewhere, sweetie?",5,How I Met Your Mother,31,5
27423,Ted,5," Yes, kids, it turns out Crumpet Manor had pampered Lily into a nearly comatose state of relaxation. She didn't even notice we were gone.",5,How I Met Your Mother,137,24
27425,Lily,5," Mmm... Oh, oh, oh... Yeah...",5,How I Met Your Mother,29,5

27596,Lily,6, I teach kindergarten. I shape the leaders of tomorrow.,5,How I Met Your Mother,55,9

27604,Barney,6," You need to be angry. Dispute yourself stronger.Imagine that Marshall never have to wash dishes in all your life, all the plates are clean.

27638,Ted,6, It's your fault. You took advice in love with Barney.,5,How I Met Your Mother,54,10

27782,Barney,7," If you watch this tape, and I knew it... is that you are in possession of all my p0rn. It can only mean two things, either I'm dead or I'm in a committed relationship. If I died, I want you honor my memory by taking my body in the Hamptons and recreating Weekend at Bernie. I want to dance. I want to make love. And I want to go fishing. If, on the other hand, I'm in a relationship, as best friend, I have one favor to ask. Please, for God's sake, get me out of here!",5,How I Met Your Mother,469,97

27818,Marshall,7, My favorite cop show.,5,How I Met Your Mother,22,4

27824,Marshall,7," If they are not happy, why not break?",5,How I Met Your Mother,38,8
27825,Ted,7, They are too stubborn. Neither wants to be the first to admit he no longer wants. They play at first that deflates.,5,How I Met Your Mother,116,22
27826,Marshall,7, I think the first who plays Barney deflates.,5,How I Met Your Mother,45,8
27827,Lily,7," It's a bad time. It takes time to get used to each other. They are... How do you say ""selfish"" nicely?",5,How I Met Your Mother,103,21
27829,Lily,7, Independents. Every relationship goes through there.,5,How I Met Your Mother,53,6

27843,Marshall,7, So you're happy?,5,How I Met Your Mother,17,3
27844,Barney,7, And you know what happens right after a fight? Gender reconciliation. What is different... when you're in a loving and lasting relationship.,5,How I Met Your Mother,141,22

30932,Ted,18, I confess. Raspberry was a mistake. But how would I know?,5,How I Met Your Mother,58,11
30934,Ted,18," If this is so important, Amanda is not in the picture. It does not spoil your birthday. Give him a chance.",5,How I Met Your Mother,107,21

30949,Ted,18, What are you talking?,5,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
30950,Marshall,18," You bring her girls at our parties, and it lets them believe that things are serious. After the largues when you, you know to whom they turn? Me. I was the cleaning crew of your girlfriends for years.",5,How I Met Your Mother,201,38
30953,Marshall,18," I had just returned from a marathon to study the law library. Hi, Natalie, where is Ted?",5,How I Met Your Mother,89,17
30955,Marshall,18, You know what? I have not slept for 36 hours. Just a few minutes.,5,How I Met Your Mother,66,14

31118,Lily,19," No one who scares. A tiny Beretta pink that goes with these cute sandals I just bought. In fact, our new credit card works.",5,How I Met Your Mother,124,24
31119,Marshall,19," You do not need a weapon. All studies in the world come together to say that a home is safer with no weapon, especially ours. You know how I ever hurt you unintentionally.",5,How I Met Your Mother,172,33
31122,Marshall,19," Pretty easy, huh?  Dispatch, baby. The party will begin.  You had to disguise yourself in sexy chat!",5,How I Met Your Mother,101,17
31123,Lily,19, I have changed my mind.,5,How I Met Your Mother,24,5
31125,Marshall,19," Now, you want to add a weapon in this equation?",5,How I Met Your Mother,48,10
31126,Lily,19," I know, you're right, but every time I close my eyes, I see this guy pointing a gun at you. And... you're my world, Marshall. If something happened to you one day, I would...",5,How I Met Your Mother,175,34
31127,Marshall,19," I know. I know. Listen, I must confess something. This attack did not go exactly as I said.",5,How I Met Your Mother,92,18
31128,Barney,19, So it was indeed a black bonnet. J'l'avais said!,5,How I Met Your Mother,49,9
31129,Marshall,19, He wore no black cap. It is wearing nothing at all.,5,How I Met Your Mother,52,11
31130,Ted,19," Wait, so...",5,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
31133,Marshall,19, It's good. It's good.,5,How I Met Your Mother,22,4

31137,Barney,19, I do not ask where he kept his weapon.,5,How I Met Your Mother,39,9
31138,Ted,19, We're sure it was a weapon?,5,How I Met Your Mother,28,6
31139,Marshall,19," No, guys. I came home from work on foot. Through Central Park, and I stopped at the zoo.",5,How I Met Your Mother,89,18
31143,Marshall,19, It's good. It's good.,5,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
31146,Barney,19, You're telling us...,5,How I Met Your Mother,21,3
31147,Ted,19, What you got mugged...,5,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
31148,Marshall,19, For a monkey. I got mugged by a monkey.,5,How I Met Your Mother,40,9
31150,Barney,19, You've been mugged by a monkey?,5,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
31151,Marshall,19," Yeah, I got mugged by a monkey. I was embarrassed, so I invented another story. The important, Lily, you do not need a weapon.",5,How I Met Your Mother,127,24
31152,Lily,19, Forget the weapon. It is on that now.,5,How I Met Your Mother,38,8
31153,Ted,19, The monkeys attack people? It really is a jungle out.,5,How I Met Your Mother,54,10
31154,Lily,19, This monkey has our address. And if it belonged to a gang?I hope he will climb to see us.,5,How I Met Your Mother,90,19
31155,Barney,19, Why did not you asked the guard to recover your wallet?,5,How I Met Your Mother,56,11
31156,Marshall,19, Because I saw that the monkey did and I wanted more after.,5,How I Met Your Mother,59,12
31158,Barney,19, New information has been discovered on the attack on Marshall.,5,How I Met Your Mother,63,10
31159,Robin,19, Really? They caught him?,5,How I Met Your Mother,25,4
31160,Ted,19, He is behind bars.,5,How I Met Your Mother,19,4
31161,Robin,19," So, where did they find?",5,How I Met Your Mother,25,5
31162,Lily,19," I think naked in a tree, throwing his feces.",5,How I Met Your Mother,45,9
31163,Robin,19, I've seen. That's why I take the taxi.,5,How I Met Your Mother,39,8
31164,Ted,19," You know how they caught him, huh?",5,How I Met Your Mother,35,7
31165,Marshall,19, They tracked.,5,How I Met Your Mother,14,2
31166,Ted,19, They tracked!,5,How I Met Your Mother,14,2
31167,Robin,19, What's happening?,5,How I Met Your Mother,18,2
31168,Marshall,19, Okay. That's what happened.,5,How I Met Your Mother,28,4
31169,Barney,19," No, I said. This is my story. You see, the young Marshall was at the zoo, eating a banana...",5,How I Met Your Mother,93,19
31171,Marshall,19," I ate no banana! If you tell it, do it well.",5,How I Met Your Mother,45,11
31172,Barney,19, You're right. The banana was on the floor.,5,How I Met Your Mother,43,8
31174,Marshall,19, Was not... Was not banana banana.,5,How I Met Your Mother,34,6
31175,Barney,19," Marshall, I'm sorry, really. Here's what happened.",5,How I Met Your Mother,51,7
31177,Marshall,19, Do not shoot. There was no banana!,5,How I Met Your Mother,35,7
31178,Robin,19," Come on, Barney. I know that Marshall has not been mugged by a monkey.",5,How I Met Your Mother,71,14
31179,Marshall,19," This part is right. It is not unusual, right? Thailand, China, Costa Rica, people are attacked by monkeys all the time.They are gatherers. Because of their dynamic inter-social, have a predisposition to flight, gives them a genetic advantage.",5,How I Met Your Mother,243,38
31180,Lily,19, You've been mugged by a monkey!,5,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
31181,Ted,19, It might be curious. You were wearing a yellow hat?,5,How I Met Your Mother,52,10
31183,Ted,19, What? Him in your program? And my model?,5,How I Met Your Mother,41,8
31184,Robin,19, No one wants to see a guy who comes to play with dolls.,5,How I Met Your Mother,56,13
31185,Ted,19," First, it was not what you think. Secondly, you got a guy playing with dolls.",5,How I Met Your Mother,78,15
31188,Robin,19," So, your dolls are favorites of Rhinebeck prices next month.",5,How I Met Your Mother,61,10
31191,Ted,19, And you invited back for a second interview.,5,How I Met Your Mother,45,8
31192,Robin,19," Because the FBI wanted to be occupied while they searched his home. Come on, Marshall. I need history. It has everything. Crime, monkeys, no stupid model of the Empire State Building, which takes me all my living room and smelly glue everywhere. Go. Do this for me... As a friend?",5,How I Met Your Mother,281,50
31193,Lily,19, It would be nice to see you on TV.,5,How I Met Your Mother,35,9
31194,Marshall,19, Can you promise me to present it so that I am not ridiculous to myself assaulted by a monkey?,5,How I Met Your Mother,94,19
31195,Lily,19, You've been mugged by a monkey.,5,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
31198,Barney,19, I've just been mugged.,5,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
31199,Ted,19, What?,5,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
31200,Barney,19, That's what I said to the girl at the bar just now...,5,How I Met Your Mother,54,12
31202,Barney,19, It was downright terrifying. I would just like to forget what happened and continue to live my life.,5,How I Met Your Mother,101,18
31205,Barney,19," Well, my name is not Neil. This is Bar...",5,How I Met Your Mother,42,9
31212,Barney,19," Well, I can do. You see, I was on the road to the launch pad when I got mugged. And the aggressor... took my keys from the shuttle. Successful. Who wants to do something to 3?",5,How I Met Your Mother,176,36
31216,Barney,19, And it was the best thing in my life 3.,5,How I Met Your Mother,40,10
31217,Ted,19," Funny, you look like you just got two vodka and tonic in the face.",5,How I Met Your Mother,67,14
31218,Marshall,19, You're the lemon in your hair.,5,How I Met Your Mother,31,6
31219,Barney,19," The story is better with my end... It's... Okay? So we were there, zero gravity. They wore helmets that astronauts...",5,How I Met Your Mother,118,20
31221,Marshall,19, Really? Cool.,5,How I Met Your Mother,14,2
31222,Robin,19, Who knows someone who has been mugged by a monkey?,5,How I Met Your Mother,51,10
31223,Marshall,19," Nobody except the good people of Thailand, China, Costa Rica and many other countries where the crime committed by the monkeys is a common nuisance.",5,How I Met Your Mother,149,25
31224,Robin,19," The best is that it is possible that the story goes on national TV. Guys, this story of the monkey attacker can make me famous.",5,How I Met Your Mother,128,25
31225,Marshall,19," Me too. Guys, it will not. I can not do that.",5,How I Met Your Mother,46,11
31226,Ted,19, It's a little embarrassing. So what?,5,How I Met Your Mother,37,6
31227,Marshall,19, That's not it. Guys... I'm not assaulted by a monkey.,5,How I Met Your Mother,54,10
31229,Ted,19," So, you've not been mugged by a monkey?",5,How I Met Your Mother,40,8
31230,Marshall,19, Not at all.,5,How I Met Your Mother,12,3
31231,Barney,19, So what you're saying is that you got the monkey trapped so you give him your wallet?,5,How I Met Your Mother,86,17
31232,Marshall,19," No, that's not it.",5,How I Met Your Mother,19,4
31233,Ted,19, So you got the monkey attacked?,5,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
31234,Marshall,19," Guys, there was no monkey! He was a man with a gun.",5,How I Met Your Mother,52,12
31235,Barney,19," You sure it was not a monkey on the shoulders of another monkey, wearing a trench coat?",5,How I Met Your Mother,88,17
31236,Ted,19, That would be the right size.,5,How I Met Your Mother,30,6
31237,Marshall,19," I just invented this story that Lily does not buy a weapon. In truth, it never happened.",5,How I Met Your Mother,89,17
31238,Barney,19, I can not believe.,5,How I Met Your Mother,19,4
31239,Marshall,19, What?,5,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
31240,Barney,19, You heard me. You got attacked by a monkey. You want to go to the issuance of Robin because you're afraid of being ridiculous.,5,How I Met Your Mother,127,24
31241,Marshall,19, I would not?,5,How I Met Your Mother,13,3
31242,Barney,19," If serious, this is too funny.",5,How I Met Your Mother,31,6
31243,Marshall,19," Well, this has never happened. And I can lie to you because you are my best friends.",5,How I Met Your Mother,85,17
31244,Barney,19," I, yes, but still.",5,How I Met Your Mother,19,4
31245,Marshall,19, But I can not lie on national TV.,5,How I Met Your Mother,34,8
31246,Barney,19, You know a long time. He told the truth?,5,How I Met Your Mother,41,9
31247,Marshall,19," Ted, do not do that...",5,How I Met Your Mother,23,5
31248,Ted,19, I could not say. It smells good. But I could not say.,5,How I Met Your Mother,54,12
31249,Barney,19, I still say that it happened.,5,How I Met Your Mother,30,6
31250,Ted,19," Maybe. But, Marshall, if you have not been attacked by a monkey, Robin must not speak on his show. It would be more credible.",5,How I Met Your Mother,126,24
31251,Barney,19," Journalists lie constantly. Sorry, but I believe that Jack Palance is dead when I see the body.",5,How I Met Your Mother,96,17
31252,Ted,19," It will perhaps shock you Barney, but people do not like lying to them.",5,How I Met Your Mother,72,14
31253,Barney,19," False! They like to discover that they lied. ""Because a lie is just a great story that has mixed with the truth."" Barney Stinson. Example, that Sarah gave me this!",5,How I Met Your Mother,164,30
31254,Marshall,19, You mean what you done to him.,5,How I Met Your Mother,31,7
31255,Barney,19," No, I mean what she did. In truth, I fear that history has not gone exactly as I said.",5,How I Met Your Mother,87,19
31257,Barney,19," Passed. Who wants to do something to 3?  Lisa, wait.",5,How I Met Your Mother,53,10
31259,Barney,19," It's you Lisa? Sarah, wait. Listen. I'm Neil Armstrong.Sorry I lied.",5,How I Met Your Mother,69,11
31262,Barney,19," 31 years! I was happy, very happy, thinking that because I put a 28 year old daughter who has taken too much sun. People want to lie. Marshall, they need the lie, that's why, in my case, you've been mugged by a monkey. As far as I'm done with this plan 3. I am the best in the world!",5,How I Met Your Mother,284,59
31264,Barney,19, You know it.,5,How I Met Your Mother,13,3
31265,Lily,19, Well done! I have too much sleep last night. Can you imagine that I almost buy a gun? I'm glad you assaulted by a monkey.,5,How I Met Your Mother,122,25
31266,Marshall,19, You got me. I was just nervous. I got mugged by a monkey.,5,How I Met Your Mother,58,13
31267,Barney,19, Yeah! I knew it.,5,How I Met Your Mother,17,4
31268,Ted,19, Now I think you're not really mugged by a monkey.,5,How I Met Your Mother,50,10
31269,Barney,19," Come on, Ted. Why he would invent something like that?",5,How I Met Your Mother,55,10
31270,Marshall,19," Come on, Ted.",5,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
31271,Ted,19," Come here. Seriously, what's your flavor? It's intoxicating.",5,How I Met Your Mother,61,8
31272,Ted,19," Late the next night, we went on board the issue of Robin.",5,How I Met Your Mother,58,12
31273,Robin,19," Do not be nervous. We will sit down... It's that thing, whore?",5,How I Met Your Mother,63,12
31274,Ted,19," I know. Looks like something covered by a sheet. If you want to discover, you will have to do a story on it.",5,How I Met Your Mother,109,23
31275,Robin,19, It's you who will be covered by the sheet if you leave your model not stupid.,5,How I Met Your Mother,78,16
31276,Barney,19," Dude, what do you do?",5,How I Met Your Mother,22,5
31277,Ted,19," I do not think Marshall will lie on TV. And when it gives up, I wanna be there for Robin, with a story. Or rather, 102 stories, because it is the height of a building in New York.",5,How I Met Your Mother,180,38
31278,Barney,19, Now I want a weapon.,5,How I Met Your Mother,21,5
31279,Marshall,19, The monkey is there.,5,How I Met Your Mother,21,4
31280,Robin,19, Surprise. We thought it would help to bring you to confront your abuser.,5,How I Met Your Mother,73,13
31282,Lily,19, I bet he will love it.,5,How I Met Your Mother,23,6
31284,Marshall,19, The name of his companion is Milly?,5,How I Met Your Mother,36,7
31285,Ted,19, And then the interview began.,5,How I Met Your Mother,30,5
31286,Robin,19," In your own words, describe what happened.",5,How I Met Your Mother,43,7
31287,Marshall,19," Well... I'd love to tell you what happened, Robin. But... I really want to know what's under that sheet.",5,How I Met Your Mother,105,19
31288,Robin,19, We talk about that. We speak your aggression.,5,How I Met Your Mother,46,8
31289,Marshall,19," People are attacked every day in New York, Robin, do we often see what's under that sheet? You can shoot it?",5,How I Met Your Mother,109,21
31290,Robin,19, We come back.,5,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
31292,Robin,19, What are you doing?,5,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
31293,Marshall,19, I have not really been attacked by a monkey. I invented it for that Lily buys a gun.,5,How I Met Your Mother,85,18
31294,Lily,19, You have not been attacked by a monkey?,5,How I Met Your Mother,40,8
31295,Marshall,19," What are you talking, baby? Of course I do.",5,How I Met Your Mother,44,9
31296,Robin,19," Great, tell it to America. Five minutes.",5,How I Met Your Mother,41,7
31297,Marshall,19, Not five minutes. I have not been attacked by a monkey.,5,How I Met Your Mother,56,11
31298,Lily,19, It's good. I buy a gun.,5,How I Met Your Mother,24,6
31299,Marshall,19, No. I got mugged.,5,How I Met Your Mother,18,4
31301,Marshall,19, No! I have not been mugged!,5,How I Met Your Mother,28,6
31302,Barney,19, You know if it was attacked?,5,How I Met Your Mother,29,6
31303,Ted,19, I have no idea.,5,How I Met Your Mother,16,4
31305,Lily,19, Tell us just what happened.,5,How I Met Your Mother,28,5
31306,Robin,19," Yes, tell us the truth.",5,How I Met Your Mother,24,5
31307,Ted,19, And that's when Marshall realized that there was one thing to say.,5,How I Met Your Mother,67,12
31308,Marshall,19, Okay! That is the truth. I go back... back to bed.,5,How I Met Your Mother,51,11
31310,Ted,19," And that was it. We never knew what really happened to the portfolio of Marshall. But we know that. Aunt Lily has never had a weapon, Robin's credibility remained intact, and Bobo and Milly lived together at the Central Park Zoo.",5,How I Met Your Mother,230,41
31311,Robin,19," sh1t. Okay, put a microphone.",5,How I Met Your Mother,30,5
31312,Ted,19, Micro and makeup in place. The socks of the arch duchess.,5,How I Met Your Mother,58,11
31313,Barney,19, It was not very satisfactory. When I tell that he was attacked by a monkey. And I keep the stuff of banana. It was good.,5,How I Met Your Mother,121,25
31314,Ted,19," Barney, stop lying. You can not put another end because the conclusion does not satisfy you.",5,How I Met Your Mother,93,16
31315,Barney,19," Really? Well, believe me, Mosby. One day you shall tell this story and you'll see things my way.",5,How I Met Your Mother,97,18
31316,Ted,19, I doubt it.,5,How I Met Your Mother,12,3
31317,Ted,19, The children you will not believe what happened.,5,How I Met Your Mother,49,8
31325,Ted,19, It's really happening?,5,How I Met Your Mother,23,3
31326,Barney,19," Of course, Ted.",5,How I Met Your Mother,16,3
31327,Ted,19, True story.,5,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
31328,Ted,20," Children, everybody has at least a moment to take a huge decision, a crazy decision that will change their lives forever. This is a story of mine.",5,How I Met Your Mother,147,27
31330,Ted,20," It all started with a visit to my mother and her boyfriend for a long time, Clint, who always said things in the style...",5,How I Met Your Mother,122,24
31332,Ted,20, Please do not.,5,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
31334,Ted,20," Please, stop.",5,How I Met Your Mother,14,2

31340,Ted,20," Yeah! Finally, I... I'm glad you're happy.",5,How I Met Your Mother,43,7
31344,Ted,20," Yes, my mother was lapping. I married for the second time before I get married once. I was so happy for them.f*cking happy. While weddings can be magical. As far as I know, I'll end up dancing with my future wife in this marriage.",5,How I Met Your Mother,231,44
31347,Ted,20, It was not her.,5,How I Met Your Mother,16,4
31348,Lily,20," Oh, congratulations!",5,How I Met Your Mother,21,2
31349,Marshall,20, We're so happy for you!,5,How I Met Your Mother,24,5
31351,Ted,20," I love to listen to you, Mom.",5,How I Met Your Mother,30,7
31353,Ted,20," Children, there was no guitar.",5,How I Met Your Mother,31,5

31364,Barney,20," Guys, guys! Guess what Robin has done.",5,How I Met Your Mother,39,7
31367,Barney,20, You're currently whining?,5,How I Met Your Mother,26,3
31368,Robin,20," I know it's stupid, but... And the dragon. They are happy, you know?",5,How I Met Your Mother,69,13
31369,Barney,20," Not as much as me, Robin. Guys, guys! Guess what Robin has done.",5,How I Met Your Mother,65,13
31371,Barney,20," And then I just tell you guys what Robin has done, but you were there for. I must tell you the rest of the wedding. Aunt Meredith!",5,How I Met Your Mother,131,27
31372,Ted,20," Children, I can not exaggerate how horrible it is to be a single guy in his mother's second marriage.",5,How I Met Your Mother,102,19
31378,Barney,20," Robin whining during the song Clint. Oh, I've already said. The super good sister of Ted, Heather!",5,How I Met Your Mother,99,17
31379,Ted,20, I gotta go.,5,How I Met Your Mother,12,3
31380,Marshall,20," Wait, Ted. And your speech?",5,How I Met Your Mother,28,5
31381,Ted,20, Inventing an emergency or anything. I... I... I'll get it.,5,How I Met Your Mother,59,10
31382,Marshall,20," Ted, Ted, what are you doing? It is the marriage of your mother!",5,How I Met Your Mother,65,13
31384,Barney,20," Uncle Larry, sky gods. Niagara Falls. It is empty.",5,How I Met Your Mother,51,9
31385,Ted,20, And my friends I have not seen during the next 72 hours.,5,How I Met Your Mother,57,12
31387,Lily,20," Seriously, Ted is fine? I mean, I know that the weekend was hard, but hey... it's weird radio silence.",5,How I Met Your Mother,103,19
31388,Robin,20, I know. His mother called such five times to ask where he was.,5,How I Met Your Mother,63,13
31389,Barney,20, Sorry Robin. They are all out of pretzels. And I know how you're emotional.  Shh. Leave it alone.,5,How I Met Your Mother,98,18
31390,Robin,20," Okay! Okay, I... I cried during the song Clint.",5,How I Met Your Mother,48,9
31391,Barney,20, She cried to the song of Clint.,5,How I Met Your Mother,32,7
31392,Ted,20," Hi, guys.",5,How I Met Your Mother,10,2
31393,Lily,20," Ted, where were you?",5,How I Met Your Mother,21,4
31394,Robin,20, Is that okay?,5,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
31395,Ted,20," Oh, that's fine. I'm in top form. Go. We'll take a look!",5,How I Met Your Mother,57,12
31397,Marshall,20," Hey, man, you would not possibly let someone who does not like a kind of mania old driving license?",5,How I Met Your Mother,100,19
31398,Lily,20," Yeah, but where we're going to end?",5,How I Met Your Mother,36,7
31399,Ted,20," First, let me tell you what happened on the wedding day.",5,How I Met Your Mother,57,11
31401,Ted,20," Watching my mother to marry, I realized how I was late in relation to it on my life. I'm just going to leave here. So I walked into my hotel room and I went on a website where I go sometimes when I have trouble sleeping.",5,How I Met Your Mother,221,46
31404,Lily,20, We do not want to know what you do on the internet when you feel alone.,5,How I Met Your Mother,72,16
31405,Ted,20, I have not spent... It is not that part of the night I was talking about.,5,How I Met Your Mother,74,16
31407,Ted,20," I was on my favorite site for real estate auction... Come on, we all did... visit some properties on the site.",5,How I Met Your Mother,111,21
31410,Ted,20, Guys... I just bought the house of my dreams.,5,How I Met Your Mother,46,9
31411,Lily,20," What, are you saying that you bought the house?",5,How I Met Your Mother,48,9
31412,Ted,20," I mean, I put an online auction and I won the next day and I was accepted. I have just finalized all the paperwork.",5,How I Met Your Mother,116,24
31413,Barney,20," And that was fine with Blair Witch, and she tried to haggle on closing costs?",5,How I Met Your Mother,78,15
31414,Marshall,20," Try not to laugh with you that, man.",5,How I Met Your Mother,37,8
31415,Ted,20," So, I thought this piece would be the desktop. You see, a place just for dad. I mean, kids can come if they read a book, but no toy. This is not about to hold my love. It is rather a question of drawing a boundary.",5,How I Met Your Mother,215,46
31416,Robin,20, Whoa.,5,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
31417,Lily,20," Ted, you're barge. It will take years and a small fortune for it to be liveable.",5,How I Met Your Mother,81,16
31418,Ted,20," I'm an architect. I would find a way. And if I start now, this is over so that my wife and I can move.",5,How I Met Your Mother,103,24
31419,Barney,20," Is it in the room with us right now, Ted?",5,How I Met Your Mother,42,10
31420,Ted,20," Okay, okay. I know. I have not found Ms. Mosby yet, but I will get it. Knock on wood.",5,How I Met Your Mother,86,19
31421,Marshall,20," Look out, man.",5,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
31422,Lily,20," Ted, you can not go on like this where you will make your life. It does not work like that.",5,How I Met Your Mother,92,20
31423,Robin,20," Yeah, I agree. This is perhaps the dumbest thing you've ever done.",5,How I Met Your Mother,67,12
31424,Barney,20, The dumbest thing that ON've ever done.,5,How I Met Your Mother,40,7
31425,Marshall,20," Okay, well. Ted let alone a little, right?",5,How I Met Your Mother,43,8
31426,Ted,20, Thank you.,5,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
31427,Marshall,20," Okay? We all did stupid stuff in our lives. For example, I remember once when I put the rocket in the bathroom and tried to put them to dry in the microwave.",5,How I Met Your Mother,158,32
31428,Robin,20," My God, you had to be completely stuffed.",5,How I Met Your Mother,42,8
31429,Barney,20," No, it's too dumb to whether adult. It should be child when it happened.",5,How I Met Your Mother,73,14
31430,Robin,20, Children? Why...,5,How I Met Your Mother,17,2
31431,Barney,20, Put rockets in...,5,How I Met Your Mother,18,3
31432,Marshall,20," Oh, my God, guys! Great new game",5,How I Met Your Mother,33,7
31433,Lily,20, Bourre.,5,How I Met Your Mother,8,1
31434,Robin,20, Bourre.,5,How I Met Your Mother,8,1
31435,Barney,20, Gamin.,5,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
31436,Ted,20, Gamin.,5,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
31437,Marshall,20," Drum roll, please. I was... Drunk!",5,How I Met Your Mother,35,6
31438,Barney,20," You know, I'm glad Robin have guessed. Because it is really sensitive and fragile. I talk about the times she cried during the song Clint. And while I whisper, I hope she hears me.",5,How I Met Your Mother,181,34
31439,Robin,20, It was not me!,5,How I Met Your Mother,15,4
31440,Lily,20, What?,5,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
31441,Robin,20, It's not me who cried during the song Clint.,5,How I Met Your Mother,45,9
31444,Robin,20, Are you crying?,5,How I Met Your Mother,16,3
31445,Barney,20," I know it's silly, but... And the dragon. They are happy, you know?",5,How I Met Your Mother,68,13
31446,Robin,20, Not as much as me.,5,How I Met Your Mother,19,5
31447,Barney,20, I shall spin you 500 dollars if it happened to you instead of me.,5,How I Met Your Mother,66,14
31448,Robin,20, $ 500? No worries.,5,How I Met Your Mother,19,4
31449,Barney,20," Thank you, Robin. You saved me an explanation and an excruciating public humiliation. Guys! Guys! Guess what Robin has done.",5,How I Met Your Mother,125,20
31451,Barney,20," Wait, you're...",5,How I Met Your Mother,16,2
31453,Ted,20," Oh, great! I began to think that you would not come.",5,How I Met Your Mother,53,11
31455,Ted,20, Hmm.,5,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
31457,Barney,20," Wait, wait. You will inspect the place where now?",5,How I Met Your Mother,50,9
31458,Ted,20," Well, yeah.",5,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
31460,Marshall,20," Okay! Well! Well, just remember that we all did stupid stuff in our lives, okay? For example, once I tried to cycle on an extension ladder to a roof of a two-story house. The only question is I was a kid or drunk? Drum roll, please.",5,How I Met Your Mother,233,46
31463,Marshall,20, I was...,5,How I Met Your Mother,9,2
31466,Marshall,20," A kid! Mom, are you? You always make a fuss about nothing.",5,How I Met Your Mother,59,12
31467,Ted,20," Hey, check the porch, huh? Go. I will put a gate there.Every Sunday here, it'll be a huge party sausage.",5,How I Met Your Mother,105,20
31468,Marshall,20, Hmm... sausage party?,5,How I Met Your Mother,22,3
31469,Ted,20," Burgers, burgers will be made.",5,How I Met Your Mother,31,5
31470,Lily,20," Ted, stop that. You can not keep this house. This is a huge mistake.",5,How I Met Your Mother,69,14
31471,Ted,20," Lily, listen to me. I had a plan, right? A woman, a house, children, and it turned out that the universe is really sh1t to what is the wife and children. So what is the thing I can control? The house I bought. It's not a huge mistake.",5,How I Met Your Mother,235,48
31472,Marshall,20," Exactly. Now, I currently drive the car of my brother in the opposite direction on I-94. Now that was a big mistake. I was... a kid.",5,How I Met Your Mother,133,26
31473,Robin,20," Wow, Barney. You've been crying about this guy or what?",5,How I Met Your Mother,56,10
31475,Lily,20," You see, you should have waited to see all the problems that home.",5,How I Met Your Mother,67,13
31476,Ted,20," You can always have problems with any decision, but you can not let that stop you. First day in college, Marshall knew he wanted to spend his life with you. And if someone was there to contradict his decision?",5,How I Met Your Mother,210,39
31479,Marshall,20," I know this is our second hot date but, Lily Aldrin, I will marry you.",5,How I Met Your Mother,71,15
31482,Ted,20," But Marshall took the risk, and that's the best thing that ever happened to you both.",5,How I Met Your Mother,86,16
31483,Barney,20," It was Robin! ""What! ""Yes, it was Robin who cried at the song Clint! But she said... I know what she said. But that's not what she wanted you to know.",5,How I Met Your Mother,151,31
31486,Robin,20," Look, Barney, I support most all these jokes about me crying. And if I claim to prove it was you who was crying, that you would not be a problem?",5,How I Met Your Mother,146,30
31487,Barney,20, Of course.,5,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
31488,Robin,20," I made a mistake in letting you go, right? Your pen1s is huge.",5,How I Met Your Mother,63,13
31490,Lily,20," Boy, you've almost had us still.",5,How I Met Your Mother,33,6
31491,Marshall,20, You're always a little too far.,5,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
31492,Barney,20, sh1t.,5,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
31494,Ted,20, Really?,5,How I Met Your Mother,8,1
31496,Ted,20, And if I had already bought the son of a bitch?,5,How I Met Your Mother,48,11
31498,Marshall,20, He said he had found a tramp?,5,How I Met Your Mother,30,7
31499,Ted,20," Ok, yes. There are problems. But I see this house as I know it can be. I see a swing on the tree outside. I see a crown on the front door at Christmas. I see a barbecue outside on the patio or I would make Barbec every weekend. I see a life I know I can be here.",5,How I Met Your Mother,263,59
31501,Barney,20, I see a complaint.,5,How I Met Your Mother,19,4
31504,Robin,20," Hey, good, good news is that the inspector has killed some cockroaches at the time of impact.",5,How I Met Your Mother,94,17
31505,Lily,20," Oh, stay there. Huge hole on the second floor. I just want to be sure the report is accurate.",5,How I Met Your Mother,94,19
31506,Ted,20," You were right. It was a huge mistake. It's just that... the world is changing, but me... You have a flat 'for years. It's getting serious between Robin and Don. Barney, perhaps this is a new tie?",5,How I Met Your Mother,197,37
31507,Barney,20, Thank you. My God.,5,How I Met Your Mother,19,4
31508,Ted,20, Now my mother remarried. I... I'm exactly the same spot 5 years ago. I'm tired. I'm... I'm ready for life that goes with this house.,5,How I Met Your Mother,133,25
31509,Barney,20," OK, buddy. Sometimes people make bad decisions in life. Like your mother.",5,How I Met Your Mother,74,12
31510,Ted,20, What do you mean?,5,How I Met Your Mother,18,4
31511,Barney,20," Ted, as you know, I've always been really, really addicted to your mother.",5,How I Met Your Mother,75,13
31512,Ted,20," Please, stop.",5,How I Met Your Mother,14,2
31513,Barney,20," Actually, Virginia and I spent a special time in 2006.Before Clint.",5,How I Met Your Mother,68,11
31514,Ted,20, What are you talking about?,5,How I Met Your Mother,28,5
31515,Barney,20, I wanted to be your father!,5,How I Met Your Mother,28,6
31516,Ted,20, What does that mean?,5,How I Met Your Mother,21,4
31517,Barney,20," Do not answer me, young man. That's why I cried at the song of Clint. Because that b*st*rd stole your mother. And now all that remains for me... is the memory of the drop at the airport.",5,How I Met Your Mother,187,37
31520,Barney,20, And that's how you got the pin? Incredible. You... So... here we go.,5,How I Met Your Mother,69,13
31522,Barney,20, It is a good time. Not much traffic...,5,How I Met Your Mother,39,8
31524,Barney,20, Is it true? Hmm. I can... Listen... Ted's mother. I... I should really...,5,How I Met Your Mother,74,13
31528,Marshall,20, Again?! One too many!,5,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
31529,Barney,20," Okay, that's good. Well, I invented the last, but everything else, I swear it was true. Come on, man. Your mother is a cougar.",5,How I Met Your Mother,127,24
31530,Robin,20," Wait, I thought you said that a cougar could not be more than 50 years.",5,How I Met Your Mother,72,15
31531,Barney,20," Okay, this is a Mellencamp.",5,How I Met Your Mother,28,5
31532,Ted,20," Guys, I'm in trouble. I mean, the best I can do is to improve the house and sell the property with great losses.",5,How I Met Your Mother,113,23
31533,Lily,20," Listen, Ted... Usually in life, when you make a huge mistake, you must learn to live with. But how many times you got the chance to take a mass break out and all?",5,How I Met Your Mother,163,33
31535,Ted,20, It's silly.,5,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
31536,Barney,20, Your mother and I were at second base.,5,How I Met Your Mother,39,8
31538,Ted,20, Thank you Lily. It was fantastic.,5,How I Met Your Mother,34,6
31539,Lily,20," A Ted Mosby, owner, friends, and if he can rent it, Slumlord.",5,How I Met Your Mother,62,12
31540,Ted,20, There... there is one last thing I should do.,5,How I Met Your Mother,46,9
31541,Ted,20, And my friends have not seen during the next 72 hours.,5,How I Met Your Mother,55,11
31543,Robin,20, It was our turn.,5,How I Met Your Mother,17,4
31545,Ted,20, Hi.,5,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
31547,Ted,20," I have not been able to make your speech. I was selfish and I freaked out and I'm so sorry, so... and here... ""A hand sign for the Dj? Dee made the sign... ""I pass.

I love you. """,5,How I Met Your Mother,374,77
31549,Ted,20," There was no reason why my mother could be with a guy like that. However, as you know children, be with Grandpa Clint was the best decision taken what did your grandmother. Sometimes our best decisions are those that really have no meaning.",5,How I Met Your Mother,241,43
31551,Ted,20, Hey.,5,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
31552,Marshall,20," Hey, man.",5,How I Met Your Mother,10,2

31554,Marshall,20, Robin told me. Happy Housewarming!,5,How I Met Your Mother,35,5
31555,Ted,20, But I told you the last time I saw you I was coming home.,5,How I Met Your Mother,58,14
31556,Marshall,20," I know what you said. I also know my best friend, Ted Mosby. Listen... for all time, all the years I have told you... ""Slow! Not go too fast with this girl! ""You've not heard a single f*cking time. Your heart is both drunk and child.",5,How I Met Your Mother,234,46

31558,Marshall,20, That's what I do.,5,How I Met Your Mother,18,4
31559,Ted,20, I can... I can give you some ideas I have?,5,How I Met Your Mother,43,10
31560,Marshall,20, Yeah.,5,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
31561,Ted,20," And, children, Marshall was right. I have not given up my dream home because that's the thing with the stupid decisions. It makes them all. But time is funny. And sometimes a little magic. It may take a stupid decision... and turn it into something sensible. For children, as you know, this house... our house is.",5,How I Met Your Mother,314,56
31562,Ted,21," Children, your Aunt Robin was dating Don until recently, but one evening, coming from nowhere...",5,How I Met Your Mother,97,15

31571,Robin,21, I thought about it.,5,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
31572,Barney,21," You think about it? You hardly know him. In addition, the guy is a draw with a job that is worthless.",5,How I Met Your Mother,102,21
31573,Robin,21," We have the same job, Barney.",5,How I Met Your Mother,30,6
31574,Barney,21," And we could not be more proud of you, my angel.",5,How I Met Your Mother,49,11
31575,Lily,21, It still seems fast.,5,How I Met Your Mother,21,4
31576,Robin,21, You're probably right.,5,How I Met Your Mother,23,3
31577,Ted,21, You should live with him.,5,How I Met Your Mother,26,5
31578,Robin,21, Really?,5,How I Met Your Mother,8,1

31587,Robin,21, No. I have a system. I put the empty brick in the fridge to remind us to buy milk.,5,How I Met Your Mother,83,19
31588,Ted,21, Why not let the solid brick to remind us not to buy?,5,How I Met Your Mother,53,12
31589,Barney,21," All right. As a former... before you embark on anything, I'm meeting this guy. I think it's pretty weird not having yet met.",5,How I Met Your Mother,125,23
31590,Robin,21," Bluntly. It's as if someone was orchestrating things for this specific purpose. Okay, but you must promise to behave well.",5,How I Met Your Mother,123,20
31591,Barney,21, I promise.,5,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
31593,Barney,21," I'm doing this contortionist Portuguese, and I swear... it is so flexible, at a time, it was about me and beneath me. A top and a bottom! One and two! Which is empty?",5,How I Met Your Mother,167,33

31597,Ted,21," Actually, I'm not sure.",5,How I Met Your Mother,24,4
31599,Ted,21, Robin had never told Don she was out with Barney.,5,How I Met Your Mother,50,10
31600,Barney,21," I appreciate you, Don. Both, we love a good scotch, one likes my stories compelling. And we went out with Robin.",5,How I Met Your Mother,113,21
31601,Ted,21," There, he knew it.",5,How I Met Your Mother,19,4
31604,Robin,21," The'm not, it's as if we had never been together.",5,How I Met Your Mother,50,10

31611,Lily,21, Twin beds? I can not sleep in separate beds. We should complain.,5,How I Met Your Mother,65,12
31612,Marshall,21," Yeah, you're right, I'll ask for another room.",5,How I Met Your Mother,47,8
31613,Lily,21," Yeah, I'll go with you in just a second......",5,How I Met Your Mother,46,9
31616,Marshall,21, You can come back later? It takes a nap.,5,How I Met Your Mother,41,9

31754,Ted,21," Concentrate on the letter, ok? At Ted, Robin is the ideal girl for you, but she will not engage. You need someone who wants to settle.

32561,Ted,1, And what's that word?,6,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
32562,Barney,1, Dibs!,6,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
32563,Ted,1, What... You can't call dibs on a girl I've been sitting here thinking about maybe talking to eventually at some point.,6,How I Met Your Mother,119,21
32564,Barney,1, You never called dibs.,6,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
32565,Ted,1, Dibs were implied.,6,How I Met Your Mother,19,3
32566,Barney,1, Implied dibs?,6,How I Met Your Mother,14,2
32567,Ted,1, Yeah.,6,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
32568,Barney,1," Ted, you are spitting on the grave of Sir Walter Dibs, inventor of the dib. It was 1652... The SS Dibs was lost at sea...",6,How I Met Your Mother,122,25

32595,Barney,1, We could just do it right here.,6,How I Met Your Mother,32,7
32596,Ted,1, Fine. Have at it. Exercise your dibs. She's got her shields up anyway. She's reading a book.,6,How I Met Your Mother,93,17
32597,Barney,1," Yeah. At a bar. That book might as well be called, ""Are You There, Barney? It's Me, Horny."" That is not what ""shields up"" looks like.  That is what ""shields up"" looks like.",6,How I Met Your Mother,173,33
32598,Robin,1," Move. God!  Hey. 'Sup, dudes? Fries?",6,How I Met Your Mother,37,6

32612,Ted,1, Try? I will absolutely say no. Our friendship is too important.,6,How I Met Your Mother,64,11
32613,Robin,1," Okay, you know, maybe I wasn't clear enough. I will come at you with everything I've got. I will stalk you like the lioness stalks the gazelle",6,How I Met Your Mother,143,27
32615,Robin,1," Okay, I'm ready to have s*x now.",6,How I Met Your Mother,33,7

32620,Ted,1," Hey Robin, what do you think? The girl sitting at the bar. Shields up?",6,How I Met Your Mother,71,14
32621,Robin,1," Mmm, totes, toots. She's here on a date. She brought the book because she got here early, and she also wants to impress the guy she's meeting. Girls like to come across all classy and smart, you know? ",6,How I Met Your Mother,202,38
32622,Barney,1," This? What you're doing right now? I'm getting a ""de-rection.""",6,How I Met Your Mother,63,10

32636,Lily,1, You told your dad we're trying to have a baby?,6,How I Met Your Mother,47,10

32642,Ted,1," I feel you, buddy.",6,How I Met Your Mother,19,4

32644,Ted,1," Okay, Barney. What's this going to cost me?",6,How I Met Your Mother,44,8

32660,Barney,1," Oh, that sucks! And dibs.",6,How I Met Your Mother,26,5
32661,Robin,1," So you went on one date with one of her friends. It's not necessarily a big deal. I mean, did it end on bad terms?",6,How I Met Your Mother,115,25
32665,Robin,1," Well, I guess you just got to move on. I mean, it's not like you have a shot with Ready McGee over there, right? Ted?",6,How I Met Your Mother,118,25
32667,Ted,1, I got to see her ankles.,6,How I Met Your Mother,25,6
32668,Robin,1," You're one of those? God, I swear, one in five guys...",6,How I Met Your Mother,55,11
32671,Marshall,1," Lily! We kind of had a plan tonight, remember? Candles? Banjo?",6,How I Met Your Mother,63,11
32672,Lily,1, Who else did you tell? Did you tell anyone at the office?,6,How I Met Your Mother,58,12
32674,Marshall,1, Shannon? Start the music...,6,How I Met Your Mother,28,4
32676,Marshall,1," I may have mentioned it in passing to a couple of colleagues at work. I'm sorry about that, but you know what? I got to be able to tell my dad.",6,How I Met Your Mother,144,31
32677,Lily,1," Your dad is the last person you should tell! The man is too involved in our lives! It's like, every time the phone rings...",6,How I Met Your Mother,124,24
32679,Lily,1, Hello.,6,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
32684,Lily,1, Hello.,6,How I Met Your Mother,7,1

32693,Lily,1," So, call him and tell him we decided not to have a baby.",6,How I Met Your Mother,57,13
32694,Marshall,1," Okay, so you just... You want me to give my dad a stroke?",6,How I Met Your Mother,58,13
32695,Lily,1, Only if you want to give this a stroke.,6,How I Met Your Mother,40,9
32696,Marshall,1," That's ridiculous. Lily, there is no way that I would ever... Okay, everyone needs to shut up so that I can think!",6,How I Met Your Mother,115,22

32700,Robin,1," Oh, a cheesy guy. Don't worry.",6,How I Met Your Mother,31,6
32701,Ted,1," Oh, man! That guy is cool. His hair's all cool, he's got a cool belt.",6,How I Met Your Mother,70,15
32702,Robin,1," Well, that guy is cheesy, and if you think he's not cheesy, then you're cheesy, too, and now I want something cheesy. Who's feeling nachos?",6,How I Met Your Mother,140,25
32703,Barney,1," Oh, look at you, Robin. You're jealous.",6,How I Met Your Mother,40,7
32704,Robin,1, Jealous?,6,How I Met Your Mother,9,1

32706,Robin,1, I have not lost it.,6,How I Met Your Mother,20,5
32707,Barney,1, You lost it.,6,How I Met Your Mother,13,3
32708,Robin,1," I still have it. I know exactly where it is, and I can go get it whenever I want.",6,How I Met Your Mother,82,19
32709,Barney,1," Robin, girls are like cartons of milk. Each one has a hotness expiration date, and you've hit yours. I'm not saying the occasional guy won't still open the fridge, pick you up, give a sniff, shrug and take a sip anyway But it's all downhill from here.",6,How I Met Your Mother,252,47
32710,Robin,1, I don't have to take this. But I do have to take this.,6,How I Met Your Mother,55,13
32712,Marshall,1," Okay, so you just want me to call my dad and tell him that we're not having a baby?",6,How I Met Your Mother,84,19
32714,Marshall,1," Okay, out of curiosity,when do we tell him about the baby?",6,How I Met Your Mother,59,11
32715,Lily,1, We'll tell him about the baby when there's a baby to tell him about.,6,How I Met Your Mother,69,14
32716,Marshall,1," So, he just gets no notice? He just walks into his boss's office, and says, ""I just had a grandson. I'm gonna be out for three months.""",6,How I Met Your Mother,136,27
32717,Lily,1, Out for three months?,6,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
32718,Marshall,1, Yeah. He and my mom are coming to live with us when the baby's born. We talked about this.,6,How I Met Your Mother,91,19
32719,Lily,1," No, we didn't.",6,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
32720,Marshall,1," I meant, me and my dad.",6,How I Met Your Mother,24,6
32721,Lily,1," You know what, Marshall? Why don't you have a baby with your dad?",6,How I Met Your Mother,66,13
32722,Marshall,1," Oh, okay, Lily.Why don't you have a baby with your butt?",6,How I Met Your Mother,57,11
32723,Lily,1, What?,6,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
32724,Marshall,1, I can't think straight! Why do you have to wear that shirt? This is not how I thought this night was going to go!,6,How I Met Your Mother,114,24
32727,Ted,1," Oh, God, this sucks! Do you think she saw me?",6,How I Met Your Mother,46,10
32730,Barney,1," Yeah, she definitely saw you.",6,How I Met Your Mother,30,5
32732,Ted,1," Yeah. Yeah, sure. I mean, how could that not be fun? If I don't come back, tell my mom I love her.",6,How I Met Your Mother,99,22
32733,Barney,1," Okay, will do. And dibs.",6,How I Met Your Mother,25,5
32735,Lily,1," Barney, am I crazy? Marshall talks to his dad way too much, right?",6,How I Met Your Mother,67,13
32736,Barney,1," Oh, you don't want my opinion on that.",6,How I Met Your Mother,39,8
32737,Lily,1, Why not?,6,How I Met Your Mother,9,2
32738,Barney,1," If I had my dad's number, I would never not be on the phone with him.",6,How I Met Your Mother,70,16
32739,Lily,1, That was really...,6,How I Met Your Mother,19,3
32740,Barney,1," Whoa, a hottie with a body! Boing...!",6,How I Met Your Mother,38,7
32741,Lily,1, Brief.,6,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
32742,Barney,1," No. Lily, look.  You saucy little minx. You sundressed up.",6,How I Met Your Mother,59,10
32745,Robin,1," 14 seconds! 14 seconds, and already some dingdong is stepping up, thinking he can get some of this broke off. I... still... got... it. All right, buddy, you proved my point. Now scram. Nice belt, by the way.",6,How I Met Your Mother,208,38
32746,Barney,1," Robin, you do look super hot.",6,How I Met Your Mother,30,6
32747,Robin,1," Oh, do I?",6,How I Met Your Mother,10,3
32748,Barney,1," Yeah, you do.",6,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
32749,Robin,1, Thanks.,6,How I Met Your Mother,8,1
32754,Ted,1," Or set me up with one of your friends. No, I'm kidding. That would be weird.",6,How I Met Your Mother,77,16
32756,Ted,1," It wouldn't, would it? Any one of those three. Whichever's easiest and right nearby. And not the beer.",6,How I Met Your Mother,103,18
32758,Ted,1, Totally.,6,How I Met Your Mother,9,1
32760,Robin,1, Say good-bye before you leave?,6,How I Met Your Mother,31,5
32761,Ted,1, Her words exactly.,6,How I Met Your Mother,19,3
32762,Barney,1," Dude, you are so in. That is so awesome. A high five doesn't even cut it. High six!",6,How I Met Your Mother,84,18
32763,Ted,1," She didn't see us high-six, did she?",6,How I Met Your Mother,37,7
32764,Barney,1, No. Good. That was pretty lame.,6,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
32765,Ted,1," Yeah, let's never do that again.",6,How I Met Your Mother,33,6
32767,Lily,1, Marshall?,6,How I Met Your Mother,10,1
32768,Marshall,1," What? Lily, what? Are there more members of my family that you want to crap all over?",6,How I Met Your Mother,86,17
32769,Lily,1, Here's the thing.,6,How I Met Your Mother,18,3
32771,Marshall,1," I'm sorry. Hold on. Just... It's my dad. Lily, it's my dad, okay? I love him, and if he calls me, I'm gonna answer the phone! Hey, Dad.",6,How I Met Your Mother,136,28
32773,Marshall,1," Dad, this is...",6,How I Met Your Mother,16,3
32775,Marshall,1," Dad, I'm in the middle of something right now.",6,How I Met Your Mother,47,9
32777,Marshall,1," He's insane. My dad is insane. I'm so sorry, Lily. He's just... He's so... enthusiastic. It's ridiculous, you know? Like, who's like that?",6,How I Met Your Mother,139,23
32778,Lily,1," You. You're like that. You and your dad both care so much. It's... it's why women fall in love with the Eriksen men to begin with. But right now, it's a lot of pressure.",6,How I Met Your Mother,170,34
32779,Marshall,1," Baby, I'm not trying to pressure you one bit.",6,How I Met Your Mother,46,9
32780,Lily,1, What if I can't have a baby? That could happen. I could totally let you down. Has that thought not occurred to you?,6,How I Met Your Mother,116,23
32781,Marshall,1," Not even for one second. Not having a baby would suck, but the idea of you letting me down... that's impossible. That would be like aliens landing. That's a bad example, because that could happen. It probably already has. I saw this, episode... All right.",6,How I Met Your Mother,256,45
32782,Ted,1, I'm doing this. I am going over there. Wish me luck.,6,How I Met Your Mother,53,11
32784,Robin,1," Like I said, she's here on a date.",6,How I Met Your Mother,35,8
32787,Ted,1," Okay, maybe I'm a little nervous.",6,How I Met Your Mother,34,6
32788,Marshall,1," Dude, it's just a wedding toast.",6,How I Met Your Mother,33,6
32789,Ted,1," I know. I just... I want it to be great, you know? I want this whole day to be great.",6,How I Met Your Mother,86,20
32790,Marshall,1, It will be.,6,How I Met Your Mother,12,3
32791,Lily,1, Best man? You're being summoned.,6,How I Met Your Mother,33,5
32792,Ted,1," Geez, what now?",6,How I Met Your Mother,16,3
32793,Marshall,1," Ted, seriously, relax. Everything's... Okay, and it's raining.",6,How I Met Your Mother,63,8
32794,Ted,1, Yeah. You were saying?,6,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
32795,Marshall,1," You didn't happen to bring an umbrella, did you?",6,How I Met Your Mother,49,9
32796,Ted,1, No. I didn't bring an umbrella.,6,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
32797,Marshall,1," I mean, everyone told us that it might take a while, but... We thought we might be the exception to the rule. Anyways, we're getting back on that horse. I mean, feeling good about the future. Obviously, this goes without saying, but you won't tell Lily about any of this, right?",6,How I Met Your Mother,279,51
32799,Barney,2," So, this chick and I are going at it behind the Central Park Zoo. The Bonobo chimps start giving us a standing O, and just when I'm about to give her the same thing... What up?... I... I can't. I just... I can't. Guys, I know you count the minutes until you can escape from your humdrum lives by hearing how awesome mine is, and I love doing that for you, but I just can't tonight.",6,How I Met Your Mother,382,76
32800,Robin,2, What's wrong?,6,How I Met Your Mother,14,2
32801,Barney,2, I don't want to talk about it.,6,How I Met Your Mother,31,7
32802,Robin,2," Okay. Hey, you guys see Deadliest Catch last night?",6,How I Met Your Mother,52,9
32803,Ted,2, Did I ever! Deadliest Catch ever!,6,How I Met Your Mother,34,6
32804,Barney,2," All right, I'll tell you! My mother is selling the house I grew up in. All of my childhood memories gone, just like that!",6,How I Met Your Mother,122,24
32805,Ted,2," That sucks. I've been there, buddy.",6,How I Met Your Mother,36,6
32806,Marshall,2, What are you talking about? Your mother still lives in the house you grew up in.,6,How I Met Your Mother,81,16
32807,Ted,2," With her new hippie husband, Clint. The comfort of home is a little ruined when someone turns your old room into what I'm pretty sure is a Tantric s*x temple. With all the bamboo, pot smoke and '60s music, it's like my old G.I. Joes are frozen in some weird Vietnam flashback.",6,How I Met Your Mother,277,52
32808,Barney,2," Anyway, I need you guys to come out to Staten Island on Saturday and help box everything up.",6,How I Met Your Mother,93,18
32810,Lily,2, You expect us to spend a whole day packing up your mom's house?,6,How I Met Your Mother,64,13
32811,Barney,2, Of course not. It's a two-day job.,6,How I Met Your Mother,35,7
32812,Robin,2, Pass.,6,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
32813,Ted,2, Same.,6,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
32814,Marshall,2, Unsubscribe.,6,How I Met Your Mother,13,1
32815,Barney,2," You guys are adorable. You seriously believe that I, Barney Stinson, can't talk you into this? I got the Queen to give me a fist bump.",6,How I Met Your Mother,135,26
32816,Ted,2, No one believes that story.,6,How I Met Your Mother,28,5
32817,Lily,2," You may be able to talk the brain surgeons you pick up into doing whatever you want, but it's not gonna work on us.",6,How I Met Your Mother,116,24
32819,Lily,2, How did he do that?,6,How I Met Your Mother,20,5
32822,Barney,2," Whoa, Ted, that thing you're packing is way too big to fit in that box.",6,How I Met Your Mother,72,15
32823,Ted,2," Yeah, that's what your mom said.",6,How I Met Your Mother,33,6
32824,Barney,2, How dare you!,6,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
32825,Ted,2," No, she actually said that.",6,How I Met Your Mother,28,5
32830,Barney,2, Bro!,6,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
32831,Ted,2, How you doing?,6,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
32836,Barney,2, Mom. Stop.,6,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
32839,Barney,2, Tuesday at work. Some of the senior partners are really getting up there.,6,How I Met Your Mother,74,13
32840,Robin,2," So, Ted, yesterday at work, I totally talked you up to that super-hot makeup girl, Liz.",6,How I Met Your Mother,88,16
32841,Ted,2, Oh yeah? Mm-hmm. What did you say?,6,How I Met Your Mother,35,7
32842,Robin,2," Oh, you know, how funny you are...",6,How I Met Your Mother,35,7
32843,Ted,2, Guilty.,6,How I Met Your Mother,8,1
32844,Robin,2, Handsome.,6,How I Met Your Mother,10,1
32845,Ted,2," Who, me?",6,How I Met Your Mother,9,2
32846,Robin,2, Incredible lover.,6,How I Met Your Mother,18,2
32847,Ted,2, Really?,6,How I Met Your Mother,8,1
32848,Robin,2," Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I was all like, ""He knows a woman's body better than she knows her own, endless waves of pleasure just cresting and breaking for hours and hours..."" Blah, blah, blah. ""Orgasms so intense that you just black out."" All that stuff.",6,How I Met Your Mother,249,45
32849,Ted,2," Robin, how can I possibly live up to that review?",6,How I Met Your Mother,50,10
32850,Robin,2," What? You know what you're doing down there. Oh, Teddy Westside can bring it. We know this.",6,How I Met Your Mother,92,17
32851,Ted,2," But that is not the point. I mean, you broke the first rule of setting people up",6,How I Met Your Mother,81,17
32852,Robin,2, Maybe I did oversell you a bit.,6,How I Met Your Mother,32,7
32854,Lily,2," Oh, it gives us a rare insight into the makings of Barney Stinson. Like, look at this. Who was a cute little basketball player before he became the biggest pervert in the world?",6,How I Met Your Mother,178,33
32855,Barney,2," I loved Pee Wee basketball. Well, until they kicked me off the team... I was so awesome, the coach asked me to quit because it wasn't fair to the other kids.",6,How I Met Your Mother,158,31
32857,Barney,2," I was so awesome, the coach asked me to quit because it wasn't fair to the other kids.",6,How I Met Your Mother,87,18
32859,Marshall,2, That sounds plausible.,6,How I Met Your Mother,23,3
32860,Barney,2," Hey. It's true. Tell him, James.",6,How I Met Your Mother,33,6
32862,Barney,2," Oh, my God! Look at this. My letter from the Postmaster General. I still can't believe he took the time to write this...",6,How I Met Your Mother,121,23
32865,Barney,2," ""Dear Barney... I sincerely apologize about losing all the invitations you sent out to your eighth birthday party. That's why none of your classmates showed up. Not because you threw up when they turned the lights off at the Planetarium. No one even noticed that. Also, Janey Masterson's mother is a whore, and with gin on her breath at 10",6,How I Met Your Mother,340,60
32867,Barney,2, Thank you.,6,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
32868,Marshall,2, Does your mom make stuff like that up a lot?,6,How I Met Your Mother,45,10
32871,Barney,2, Mom? Who's my dad? All the other kids at school know who their dad is. Who's mine?,6,How I Met Your Mother,83,17
32874,Robin,2," Did she tell you that Bob Barker was your dad, too?",6,How I Met Your Mother,52,11
32876,Barney,2, Careful! Michael Jackson sent me this glove for my tenth...,6,How I Met Your Mother,60,10
32877,Ted,2, Damn. Loretta really lied a lot to her kids.,6,How I Met Your Mother,45,9
32878,Lily,2," Well, she's not alone. Whenever Marshall was acting too hyper, his mom would suddenly decide he was ""sick"" and give him cough medicine until he passed out.",6,How I Met Your Mother,156,27
32879,Marshall,2," I'm pretty sure that's what stunted my growth. I hit 6'4"" in the fifth grade, and then I just stopped.",6,How I Met Your Mother,103,20
32880,Lily,2, And then there's the most popular parental lie in history. Santa.,6,How I Met Your Mother,66,11
32881,Marshall,2," Yeah, but that's a good lie. Like when we tell Ted he'll meet the right girl and settle down.",6,How I Met Your Mother,94,19
32882,Ted,2, I always find that reassuring.,6,How I Met Your Mother,31,5
32883,Marshall,2," You will meet her, buddy.",6,How I Met Your Mother,26,5
32884,Ted,2, You think so?,6,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
32885,Marshall,2, Yeah!,6,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
32887,Lily,2," Santa's still a lie, and I'm not lying to our kids.",6,How I Met Your Mother,52,11
32888,Marshall,2," Baby, it's Santa. Don't you want our kids going to sleep on Christmas Eve with their hearts full of hope, their heads full of crazy cough syrup nightmares, knowing that downstairs Kris Kringle is stuffing their stockings full of joy and stuffing his belly full of milk and lutefisk that they left him?",6,How I Met Your Mother,302,53
32889,Lily,2, Milk and lutefisk? Santa doesn't get cookies in Minnesota?,6,How I Met Your Mother,59,9
32890,Marshall,2," Yeah, that's just what Santa needs at 3",6,How I Met Your Mother,40,8
32891,Lily,2, I'm not lying to our kids.,6,How I Met Your Mother,27,6
32892,Barney,2, Ah... Valentines. The second base of third grade. I always got a Valentine from every single girl in my class.,6,How I Met Your Mother,111,20
32894,Barney,2," Yeah, school girls... The more they ignore you, pretend to hate your guts, lock you in the coatroom over winter break, the more they secretly like you. This isn't... Who's Sam Gibbs?",6,How I Met Your Mother,183,32
32896,Barney,2, Mom addressed this and never sent it.,6,How I Met Your Mother,38,7
32898,Barney,2," Hey.  It's a picture of you and me when we were little kids. On the back, Mom wrote... ""Your son.""",6,How I Met Your Mother,99,20
32907,Barney,2," I know. Forgetting to send the photo. That poor sculptor had to work from memory. Those statues probably look nothing like us. Damn it, Mom!",6,How I Met Your Mother,141,25
32910,Robin,2," So, Ted? You were worried that I oversold you to Liz. Well, I fixed it.",6,How I Met Your Mother,72,15
32911,Ted,2, How?,6,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
32912,Robin,2," I sent her another email. ""Dear Liz. I hope it didn't sound like I was trying to oversell Ted. The truth is, he is a genuinely nice, down to earth guy, and I think you two would really hit it off.""",6,How I Met Your Mother,198,41
32913,Ted,2, Thank you. Thank you. That's perfect. That totally takes the pressure...,6,How I Met Your Mother,73,11

32920,Barney,2," Well, he's not my dad. My dad's Bob Barker.",6,How I Met Your Mother,44,9
32922,Marshall,2," I suppose you have a problem with the Easter Bunny, too.",6,How I Met Your Mother,57,11
32923,Lily,2, Not now.,6,How I Met Your Mother,9,2
32926,Barney,2," So we're doing this? We're really going to go disturb the peaceful Long Island retirement of the former mayor of Yourson, North Dakota on a Sunday afternoon? Real classy, James. Real classy.",6,How I Met Your Mother,191,32
32928,Marshall,2, Maybe we shouldn't have brought these Sloppy Joes.,6,How I Met Your Mother,51,8

32931,Ted,2," ""Ted Mosby is solid as a rock."" No. ""Dependable."" No. ""Rugged."" No.",6,How I Met Your Mother,68,12
32932,Robin,2, Why don't I just go to the Chevy Web site and copy down adjectives?,6,How I Met Your Mother,68,14
32933,Ted,2, I just want to hit that perfect middle ground.,6,How I Met Your Mother,47,9
32934,Robin,2," How about we just go wildly to both extremes and just let them balance each other out? ""Ted Mosby is really handsome, but extremely violent, and really rich, but lacks bladder control."" Oh, damn.",6,How I Met Your Mother,196,34
32935,Ted,2, What?,6,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
32936,Robin,2, That last bump just made me hit send.,6,How I Met Your Mother,38,8
32937,Ted,2," Oh, no.",6,How I Met Your Mother,8,2
32938,Robin,2, Don't worry. I'm sure that everyone will get it's a joke.,6,How I Met Your Mother,58,11
32939,Ted,2," No, they won't. They're going to think... Wait. ""Everyone""?",6,How I Met Your Mother,60,9
32941,Barney,2," ""Really rich""?",6,How I Met Your Mother,15,2
32944,Barney,2," For what? I don't know who lives here, but it's not my dad. Wait. Wait. Please, stop. Just... just give me a second, okay?",6,How I Met Your Mother,123,24
32946,Barney,2," Come on. I know Bob Barker's not really... you know. I'm not crazy. I just... I needed that. I know it may sound stupid, but I didn't always feel so great about myself growing up, and so having a celebrity dad made me feel special. But you're right, James. It's time to let go of the fantasies. It's time to grow up.",6,How I Met Your Mother,317,62
32956,Lily,2," God, this must be so hard for Barney.",6,How I Met Your Mother,38,8
32957,Marshall,2," Yeah, but you know what? He took a big step today...",6,How I Met Your Mother,53,11
32958,Barney,2," Papa! Look at us!nIt's like three of the same guy. Oh, my God, this explains why I was always so awesome at basketball. Guys, I'm black! Sorry. African-American. No. I'm allowed to say either. I got to go get my camera!",6,How I Met Your Mother,220,41
32961,Ted,2," Wait. Barney and James are two years apart. If Sam only knew Loretta for a few months, he couldn't possibly be Barney's father.",6,How I Met Your Mother,128,23
32962,Robin,2, He's also quite the detective.,6,How I Met Your Mother,31,5
32963,Lily,2, Don't worry. We'll... We'll snap Barney out of this when he gets back.,6,How I Met Your Mother,71,13
32964,Marshall,2," Or, he could just let him have this one.",6,How I Met Your Mother,41,9
32965,Ted,2, What?,6,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
32966,Lily,2, Are you kidding?,6,How I Met Your Mother,17,3
32967,Marshall,2," Guys, Barney's losing his childhood home, he finally admitted Bob Barker's not his dad, and then he watched James meet his real father. It's just a lot to go through in one afternoon. Can't we just let the guy be black for a day?",6,How I Met Your Mother,230,44
32968,Barney,2," Here, Ted. Capture the moment!",6,How I Met Your Mother,31,5
32969,Ted,2," I think you'd need Salvador Dali to capture this particular moment, but I'll give it a whirl.",6,How I Met Your Mother,94,17
32970,Barney,2," Man... I thought I was a light-skinned Caucasian, but in truth, I'm a really light-skinned African-American. Man, try to hail a cab in Manhattan. Am I right? Nope, no one's stopping for this. These guys don't understand what I'm talking about.",6,How I Met Your Mother,244,41

32981,Robin,2," Hey, look at that! Liz still wants to meet you. That's great!",6,How I Met Your Mother,62,12
32982,Ted,2, I guess. Wait a minute. You said Liz was a total ten. Why would she want to meet the incontinent freak show you described? You oversold her!,6,How I Met Your Mother,141,27
32983,Robin,2, Maybe a little.,6,How I Met Your Mother,16,3
32984,Ted,2, You said she was a ten.,6,How I Met Your Mother,24,6
32985,Robin,2, I did not specify on what scale.,6,How I Met Your Mother,33,7
32986,Ted,2, You said she looked like a movie star.,6,How I Met Your Mother,39,8

32998,Barney,2," Me first. Mom, there's something that I need to ask you, and I... I want you to be honest with me. Why do white people like Carrot Top?",6,How I Met Your Mother,136,28
33000,Barney,2, Are you sure?,6,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
33005,Barney,2," What'd Coach say, Ma?",6,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
33007,Barney,2, Why didn't anyone come?,6,How I Met Your Mother,24,4

33014,Barney,2, I already have a father. And his name... is Loretta.,6,How I Met Your Mother,53,10
33018,Barney,2, Wait. Dad! James! Where are you going? That's the best part. Can we go camping?,6,How I Met Your Mother,80,15
33021,Ted,3," Unfinished. Of all the words you could use to describe La Sagrada Familia... Brown, pointy, weird... The one that really seems to stick is ""unfinished."" Why? Because on June 7, 1926, the architect Antoni Gaudi... Whose beard was also brown, pointy, weird and unfinished......was run over by a bus. And so, his greatest masterpiece would remain forever...",6,How I Met Your Mother,355,57
33024,Barney,3," Ted, look across the bar. Three chicks",6,How I Met Your Mother,39,7
33025,Ted,3, I don't know. Got a burger coming.,6,How I Met Your Mother,35,7

33031,Barney,3, Thank you for your time.,6,How I Met Your Mother,25,5
33033,Barney,3, Fine. I'll have a three-way with hot and kind of hot while Giggles works the camera. I ride!,6,How I Met Your Mother,93,18
33034,Robin,3," So, get this",6,How I Met Your Mother,13,3
33039,Ted,3," Oh, man, it's bad enough to have to go through a horrible breakup, but then have that person pop up on your TV? Are you okay?",6,How I Met Your Mother,126,26
33040,Robin,3," Well, I'll admit, at first, I felt a little weird. But after the initial shock, I realized something",6,How I Met Your Mother,101,18

33049,Lily,3, Where's the poop?,6,How I Met Your Mother,18,3
33050,Robin,3,Okay. So it wasn't entirely a peaceful moment of closure.,6,How I Met Your Mother,57,10
33053,Robin,3," Hey, Don, here's some breaking news",6,How I Met Your Mother,36,6
33055,Robin,3," Look, I'm not proud, but Don left so quickly that I never got the chance to have that final showdown. So yelling at him, even on TV, felt kind of good. And you know what? Now I truly am over him.",6,How I Met Your Mother,196,41
33056,Ted,3, That's great.,6,How I Met Your Mother,14,2

33062,Robin,3," I am gonna kill you. I'm gonna fly to Chicago, kill you, put your stupid face on a deep dish pizza and eat it. And then maybe catch a Bears game. But mostly the killing and eating your face thing.",6,How I Met Your Mother,197,40
33064,Lily,3, Give me your phone. We're deleting Don's number.,6,How I Met Your Mother,49,8
33065,Robin,3, Don't worry. I am never doing that again. It was a one-time thing.,6,How I Met Your Mother,67,13
33066,Lily,3, Prove it. Delete contact.,6,How I Met Your Mother,26,4
33067,Robin,3, There. Deleted.,6,How I Met Your Mother,16,2

33070,Barney,3," Look, I didn't get shot down. Trust me, I'll get the yes. Barney Stinson always gets the yes. This is all part of the plan. After initial contact, I'm now in the ignoring phase.",6,How I Met Your Mother,178,34
33071,Lily,3," Barney, why can't you just take a girl out to dinner like a normal person?",6,How I Met Your Mother,75,15
33072,Barney,3, Golden rule,6,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
33075,Ted,3," What are you doing here? Oh, God! You're dating one of my students. It's Rachel, isn't it? Barney, I know she wears provocative sweaters, but she's 19! Now I'm gonna have to hear all about it, right? Go on, tell me every detail.",6,How I Met Your Mother,229,43

33081,Barney,3," Ted Mosby, it's back on. We're gonna build your building.",6,How I Met Your Mother,58,10

33089,Marshall,3," Dude, none taken. Yes, GNB is, the Empire from Star Wars. But the Death Star's gonna get built either way. And don't you think the architect of the Death Star is pretty psyched to have that thing on his space resume? I mean, yes, his design was flawed in the sense that a single bullet fired into a particular vent would explode the whole thing.",6,How I Met Your Mother,346,65
33090,Ted,3," For all we know, that was the contractor's fault.",6,How I Met Your Mother,50,9
33091,Marshall,3," But that won't happen on your watch... you know why? Because you're Ted Mosby! And you are gonna design the most beautiful, ventless, Rebel-proof building in Manhattan, with clearly marked emergency stops for every trash compactor on the detention level.",6,How I Met Your Mother,255,40
33092,Ted,3," Look, I know this is hard to understand, but right now, I have a quiet, simple, happy little life. And I like it that way. I know what my answer has to be.",6,How I Met Your Mother,156,33
33094,Ted,3," I can't take the job, Barney. I'm done with that life. No hard feelings?",6,How I Met Your Mother,73,14
33095,Barney,3, Of course not.,6,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
33096,Ted,3, All right.,6,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
33099,Ted,3," I'm telling you, no architect would ever design a giant exposed vent right over a Death Star's core reactor. That's Space Architecture 101. It had to be the contractor. Barney, back me up. Barney. Dude, this is important.",6,How I Met Your Mother,222,38
33100,Barney,3, I need another drink.,6,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
33101,Ted,3," Marshall, you want anything?",6,How I Met Your Mother,29,4
33102,Marshall,3," No, I'm fine.",6,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
33103,Ted,3," Okay, I get that he's mad at me for turning down the job, but acting like I'm not even here?",6,How I Met Your Mother,93,20
33104,Marshall,3," Wait, you turned down the job? When?",6,How I Met Your Mother,37,7
33105,Ted,3, This morning.,6,How I Met Your Mother,14,2
33106,Marshall,3," That's so weird. Just, like, an hour ago, when we were leaving work...",6,How I Met Your Mother,71,13
33109,Marshall,3," So, you still think Ted's gonna take the job?",6,How I Met Your Mother,46,9
33110,Barney,3, Please. I'll get the yes. Barney Stinson always gets the yes.,6,How I Met Your Mother,62,11
33112,Ted,3, Am I wrong or is that exactly what Barney says when he's putting the moves on a girl?,6,How I Met Your Mother,86,18
33113,Marshall,3," Exactly. I mean, it's almost like he's putting the moves on you.",6,How I Met Your Mother,65,12
33114,Ted,3," Yeah, more like the opposite. He's been ignoring me all night. Barney wants me to take the job so bad he's putting the moves on me?",6,How I Met Your Mother,132,26
33115,Marshall,3," I hope that's his end game. Actually, I don't. I like you two together.",6,How I Met Your Mother,72,14
33116,Ted,3," I don't buy it. That's crazy, even for Barney.",6,How I Met Your Mother,47,9
33117,Marshall,3," Okay, well, think about it. We've seen his moves countless times. What does he do after he's done ignoring a girl?",6,How I Met Your Mother,115,21
33119,Barney,3," Chrissy, I love your glasses.",6,How I Met Your Mother,30,5
33121,Barney,3, They totally pull focus up from that whole chin situation you got going on. To Chrissy.,6,How I Met Your Mother,88,16
33123,Marshall,3, The backhanded compliment to lower her self-esteem... a proven winner.,6,How I Met Your Mother,71,10
33124,Ted,3, But Barney hasn't done...,6,How I Met Your Mother,26,4
33125,Barney,3," Ted, I admire your loyalty. You've had that hairstyle forever. You don't care that it's out of fashion or that it's been co-opted by the lesbian community. You stick with it. To Ted.",6,How I Met Your Mother,183,33
33127,Robin,3," Hey, Lily!",6,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
33128,Lily,3," Don't ""Hey, Lily"" me. I smelled poop all the way from the hallway.",6,How I Met Your Mother,67,13
33129,Robin,3," Oh, no, not this again.",6,How I Met Your Mother,24,5
33130,Lily,3," Where's the poop, Robin?",6,How I Met Your Mother,25,4
33131,Robin,3," Okay, I left Don another message.",6,How I Met Your Mother,34,6
33133,Robin,3," ""This just in"" is what I'm gonna say when I'm stabbing you.",6,How I Met Your Mother,60,12
33135,Lily,3, But that's impossible. You deleted his number.,6,How I Met Your Mother,47,7
33136,Robin,3," I tried to. But then this thing popped up on my phone that said, ""Are you sure?"" And I wasn't sure. I can't lie to my phone.",6,How I Met Your Mother,125,27
33137,Lily,3,"Oh, sweetie, I totally understand. Delete it!",6,How I Met Your Mother,45,7
33138,Robin,3," It's not that easy, okay? You're not just deleting a number, you're deleting a part of your life. You know, all those memories, all those experiences. It's like you're admitting they're gone forever.",6,How I Met Your Mother,200,33
33139,Lily,3," I know, sweetie. I know. Delete it!",6,How I Met Your Mother,36,7
33140,Robin,3," Okay, if it's that easy, I'm gonna delete one of your numbers from your phone, see how you like it.",6,How I Met Your Mother,100,20
33141,Lily,3," My ""plezh."" If you can find a number in there that I don't call regularly, I'll gladly delete it.",6,How I Met Your Mother,98,19
33142,Robin,3, Super Kicks Karate.,6,How I Met Your Mother,20,3
33143,Lily,3," No, not that one. That's my dojo.",6,How I Met Your Mother,34,7
33144,Robin,3, You have a dojo?,6,How I Met Your Mother,17,4
33145,Lily,3, I took an introductory karate class.,6,How I Met Your Mother,37,6
33147,Lily,3," Ops, wrong room. Where do the grown-ups go for the real karate class?",6,How I Met Your Mother,70,13
33149,Lily,3, Of you? Please. I'm a kindergarten teacher.,6,How I Met Your Mother,44,7
33152,Lily,3, But I'm totally gonna sign up for more lessons.,6,How I Met Your Mother,48,9
33153,Robin,3, How long ago did you take that class?,6,How I Met Your Mother,38,8
33154,Lily,3," I don't know. It was around the time when everyone was going, ""Wassuuuuuuup!""",6,How I Met Your Mother,78,13
33155,Robin,3," How do you even remember that? Lily, this is a number that you will never dial again.",6,How I Met Your Mother,86,17
33156,Lily,3, I might.,6,How I Met Your Mother,9,2
33157,Robin,3," No, no. But you keep it in your phone because it reminds you of a version of yourself that you could be, even if it's a version of yourself that you'll never become. And that's okay.",6,How I Met Your Mother,183,36
33158,Lily,3," No, it's not. Okay, you know what? There, gone. Your move, Scherbatsky.",6,How I Met Your Mother,72,12
33161,Ted,3, I finally know what your kind goes through. I get it now.,6,How I Met Your Mother,58,12
33162,Robin,3," For the last time, I don't care how big it was, it is not the same as giving birth.",6,How I Met Your Mother,84,19
33163,Marshall,3," No! Barney's been ""putting the moves"" on Ted.",6,How I Met Your Mother,46,8
33164,Lily,3," Oh, that sucks. Although I like you two together.",6,How I Met Your Mother,50,9
33165,Marshall,3," No, he's been doing it to try to get Ted to design the new GNB Tower.",6,How I Met Your Mother,70,16
33166,Robin,3, Which moves are we talking about? Did he do the thing where he brags on himself in the form of a complaint?,6,How I Met Your Mother,108,22
33168,Barney,3," Man, every time I take out my business card and women see the GNB logo, they throw themselves at me. I miss the chase. It sucks!  Man, the courtside Knicks seats that are available to all upper level GNB employees are too close to the action. I keep getting sweat on my suit. It sucks!  Man, GNB's benefits package is so comprehensive it gives me the freedom to see any doctor I want. It sucks!",6,How I Met Your Mother,395,75
33170,Ted,3, He did.,6,How I Met Your Mother,8,2
33171,Robin,3, And the intense eye contact thing?,6,How I Met Your Mother,35,6
33173,Barney,3," So, Ted, would you like to split some jalapeno poppers?",6,How I Met Your Mother,56,10
33175,Ted,3, Okay. Yep.,6,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
33176,Robin,3, And the thing where he establishs intimacy through physical contact?,6,How I Met Your Mother,69,10
33178,Ted,3, You know why jalapeno poppers are so good? It's the cream cheese.,6,How I Met Your Mother,66,12
33179,Barney,3, That is so true.,6,How I Met Your Mother,17,4
33180,Ted,3, Yeah... Cream cheese has a mild flav-flavor so it... it balances out the spiciness of the jal... the spiciness of the... Dude!,6,How I Met Your Mother,127,22
33182,Robin,3," So at any point in this did you say, ""Barney, I know what you're doing, and it's not going to work. I am not taking that job""?",6,How I Met Your Mother,127,27
33183,Ted,3," Well, I mean, not exactly in those...",6,How I Met Your Mother,38,7
33184,Lily,3, You're loving this.,6,How I Met Your Mother,20,3
33185,Ted,3, No.,6,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
33186,Lily,3, You are. You're loving the attention.,6,How I Met Your Mother,38,6
33187,Ted,3," It's nice to be wanted, okay? And, yes, this is a new vest. Thank you all for noticing. Oh, that's right, you didn't. Barney did!",6,How I Met Your Mother,130,25
33188,Robin,3," Oh, Teddy, you are so going to spread your legs and design that building.",6,How I Met Your Mother,74,14
33189,Ted,3, I am not that kind of architect. So get this...,6,How I Met Your Mother,48,10
33191,Lily,3, Robin never deleted Don's number.,6,How I Met Your Mother,34,5
33192,Robin,3," Oh, everyone thinks it's so easy. Give me your phone. Let's delete one of yours.",6,How I Met Your Mother,81,15
33193,Marshall,3," Okay. No problem. If you can find a number that I don't need or shouldn't have in here, be my guest, but good luck. I keep my phone tight.",6,How I Met Your Mother,139,29
33194,Robin,3, Edwin.,6,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
33195,Marshall,3," Oh, no, not that one. That's the booker for the club that my band plays at. You know, my all-lawyer funk band... you remember... The Funk, the Whole Funk and Nothing but the Funk.",6,How I Met Your Mother,180,34
33200,Robin,3, You guys played one gig four years ago. I'm deleting it.,6,How I Met Your Mother,57,11
33201,Marshall,3," No, no, we're gonna... we're gonna play another gig again. Probably really soon. It's just we all got super busy, and... We're not going to play another gig again, are we?",6,How I Met Your Mother,172,31
33202,Lily,3," Probably not, baby.",6,How I Met Your Mother,20,3
33203,Robin,3," See, it's hard to hit that delete button, isn't it?",6,How I Met Your Mother,52,10
33204,Marshall,3," Well, it's just that without that number in my phone, I'm just a corporate lawyer working 60 very un-funky hours a week.",6,How I Met Your Mother,121,22
33205,Robin,3," Sorry, Marshall. But if I have to, you have to.",6,How I Met Your Mother,48,10
33206,Lily,3, Okay. Your turn.,6,How I Met Your Mother,17,3
33208,Ted,3," Barney, I gotta tell you something.",6,How I Met Your Mother,36,6
33209,Barney,3," Oh, that reminds me. I got you a little airplane. It represents the spirit of adventure. Do you like it, Ted? Do you?",6,How I Met Your Mother,118,23
33210,Ted,3, Stop it. Stop looking at me like I'm the only person in the world who matters. I'm not designing the GNB Tower.,6,How I Met Your Mother,112,22
33211,Barney,3," Yeah, I know. You turned it down. We hired someone else.",6,How I Met Your Mother,57,11
33213,Ted,3," Can you believe it? He's resorting to the oldest move in the book. The classic, ""pretend to take the offer off the table so I'll want it more."" It's so obvious, right? As if that's going to make me be like, ""Oh, God, I never should have said no.""",6,How I Met Your Mother,247,49
33214,Marshall,3," It's not a move, dude. I executed the paperwork for the new architect this morning. Barney wasn't lying.",6,How I Met Your Mother,105,18
33215,Ted,3," Oh, God, I never should have said no! Come on, GNB didn't really hire a new architect. This is just one of Barney's moves.",6,How I Met Your Mother,123,24
33216,Marshall,3," It's not a move, dude. The senior partners were getting impatient. I thought you didn't even want the job.",6,How I Met Your Mother,107,19
33217,Ted,3, I didn't! I don't! I don't. I don't!,6,How I Met Your Mother,37,8
33219,Ted,3," Okay, I'll do it!",6,How I Met Your Mother,18,4
33220,Barney,3," What? Ted, it's too late.",6,How I Met Your Mother,26,5
33221,Ted,3, I'll design it for half of what you're paying the other architect. And you know I will do stuff they would never do. Lobby stuff.,6,How I Met Your Mother,130,25
33222,Barney,3," Wow, half? Ted, on behalf of Goliath National Bank...",6,How I Met Your Mother,54,9
33223,Marshall,3," Okay, it's a move.",6,How I Met Your Mother,19,4
33224,Ted,3, What?,6,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
33225,Barney,3, Dude!,6,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
33226,Marshall,3," There is no other architect. I'm sorry, I'm sorry I lied. I was being Barney's wingman, and I never get to be the wingman.",6,How I Met Your Mother,123,24
33227,Ted,3, You guys lied to me?,6,How I Met Your Mother,21,5
33228,Barney,3, You're the world's worst wingman. You know what? I'm out of here.,6,How I Met Your Mother,66,12
33229,Marshall,3, I can do better. Take me back. You son of a bitch!,6,How I Met Your Mother,51,12
33230,Ted,3," Look, I can't do business with people who lie to me.",6,How I Met Your Mother,53,11
33231,Barney,3, We only lied to you to make you realize that you want this job.,6,How I Met Your Mother,64,14
33232,Ted,3," No, I don't. I mean, I know I said I did, but that's only because I fell for the same creepy, pickup artist voodoo of yours that countless women...",6,How I Met Your Mother,148,29
33233,Barney,3,236,6,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
33234,Ted,3,"...before me fell for. Wow, respect.",6,How I Met Your Mother,36,6
33235,Marshall,3," No... Ted... you want to do this, okay? You're just scared of getting hurt again. But you can't let fear steal your funk. That is good. There is a song in there. Excuse me.",6,How I Met Your Mother,173,34
33236,Barney,3," Come on, Ted! This is your dream.",6,How I Met Your Mother,34,7
33237,Ted,3," No, it's not. Not anymore. And you know what? Letting go of that dream was the best decision I ever made. You guys actually think I have some lingering itch to be an architect? Work 20 hours a day and weekends? To get ulcers and pull my hair out and worry and doubt myself and then at the end of it all, have the rug pulled out from under me? I love being a professor, okay? All that stupid crap they tell you about how fulfilling teaching is? It's all true. I'm happy, and I'm not letting go of that. My answer's no.",6,How I Met Your Mother,518,103
33239,Robin,3," Hey, guys.",6,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
33240,Lily,3," Where's the poop, Robin?",6,How I Met Your Mother,25,4
33241,Robin,3," How do you do that? You are like a bomb-sniffing dog, except with poop. You are a poop-sniffing dog.",6,How I Met Your Mother,101,19
33242,Marshall,3, I think that's just called a dog.,6,How I Met Your Mother,34,7
33243,Lily,3," Where's the poop, Robin?",6,How I Met Your Mother,25,4
33244,Robin,3, Fine. I called Don again.,6,How I Met Your Mother,26,5
33246,Robin,3," Hey, Don! It's Robin again. Look, I am sorry for all the calls. It's just, I saw you on the news, and it made me a little crazy for a minute. I guess I wasn't as over our breakup as I thought. But I want to say, from the bottom of my heart, I am going to kill you. No... No, I'm not. I am happy for you. And that Asian slut on your Facebook page. She's dead, too.",6,How I Met Your Mother,364,79
33248,Lily,3, I thought you deleted his number.,6,How I Met Your Mother,34,6
33249,Robin,3," I did, but it turns out, I memorized it. You can't delete contacts from your brain, Lily.",6,How I Met Your Mother,90,17
33250,Lily,3," Well, you have to try. If you ever want to have closure...",6,How I Met Your Mother,59,12
33251,Robin,3," I am never going to have closure. Okay? Closure doesn't exist. Okay, one day, Don and I are moving in together, and the next thing I know, he's on a plane to Chicago. It just... ended. And no matter how much I try to forget that it happened, it will have never not happened. Don and I will always be a loose end. We'll always be...",6,How I Met Your Mother,332,66
33253,Ted,3," Unfinished. Gaudi, to his credit, never gave up on his dream, but that's not usually how it goes. I mean, usually, it isn't a speeding bus that keeps the brown, pointy, weird church from getting built. Most of the time, it's just too difficult or too expensive, or too scary. It's only once you've stopped that you realize how hard it is to start again. So you force yourself not to want it. But it's always there. And until you finish it, it will always be...",6,How I Met Your Mother,461,86
33255,Ted,3," Hey, Barney. Hey, Rachel. Rachel, why aren't you in class?",6,How I Met Your Mother,59,10
33257,Barney,3," Yeah, Ted. Why aren't you in class? You son of a bitch. I'll call Marshall. We'll draw up the contract.",6,How I Met Your Mother,104,20
33258,Ted,3, Not so fast. I'm not that easy.,6,How I Met Your Mother,32,7
33264,Robin,3, Who is this?,6,How I Met Your Mother,13,3
33266,Robin,3," I'm sorry. Is this 917-456... I'm sorry, 465... No, wait.",6,How I Met Your Mother,58,10
33268,Robin,3, Sorry. Wrong number. Finished with that.,6,How I Met Your Mother,41,6
33270,Lily,3," Hey, punk! Bit of advice. Next time you step on a kindergarten teacher's neck, you better finish the job.",6,How I Met Your Mother,106,19
33273,Barney,4, I cannot stop staring at that girl's face.,6,How I Met Your Mother,43,8
33274,Ted,4, Face. Huh. That's your weirdest nickname for boobs yet.,6,How I Met Your Mother,56,9
33275,Barney,4," No, Ted, I'm really looking at her face.",6,How I Met Your Mother,41,8
33276,Lily,4, Aw... That's actually really sweet.,6,How I Met Your Mother,36,5
33277,Barney,4," Puffy cheeks, smudged mascara, slightly red nose... That girl was just crying. She's so sad and defenseless. Anyone have a condom?",6,How I Met Your Mother,131,21
33279,Lily,4, That's it! You know what? Five-minute time-out! Corner booth! Now.,6,How I Met Your Mother,67,10
33281,Robin,4," I don't know, it could be cool. I've never seen Woody Allen.",6,How I Met Your Mother,61,12
33283,Robin,4, I have seen plenty of other famous people. Last week I saw... Maury Povich.,6,How I Met Your Mother,76,14
33285,Lily,4," Dude, everyone sees Maury Povich.",6,How I Met Your Mother,34,5
33287,Robin,4," I am, too, a real New Yorker.",6,How I Met Your Mother,30,7
33288,Ted,4, That's adorable. You're from Canada.,6,How I Met Your Mother,37,5
33289,Robin,4, I have been here for almost six years. It's not like I just got off a boat.,6,How I Met Your Mother,76,17
33290,Lily,4," A boat! Oh, wait, that is how you say it.",6,How I Met Your Mother,42,10
33291,Ted,4, I'd say you're not a real New Yorker until you've stolen a cab from someone who needs it more than you do.,6,How I Met Your Mother,107,22
33292,Lily,4," No, you're not a real New Yorker till you've cried on the subway and not given a damn what anyone thinks.",6,How I Met Your Mother,106,21
33293,Marshall,4," No, you're not a real New Yorker until you've killed a cockroach with your bare hands.",6,How I Met Your Mother,87,16
33294,Robin,4," Those rules are all stupid, okay? I've never done any of those things.",6,How I Met Your Mother,71,13
33296,Barney,4," Okay, time's up. What are we talking about?",6,How I Met Your Mother,44,8
33297,Marshall,4," Woody Allen is eating at Gregor's, and Robin thinks that we should go see him.",6,How I Met Your Mother,79,15
33298,Barney,4, Why would I do that? I'll see him at poker on Tuesday.,6,How I Met Your Mother,55,12
33299,Robin,4," Oh, come on, if we jump in a cab, we'll be there in 15 minutes.",6,How I Met Your Mother,64,15
33300,Lily,4," A real New Yorker would know the subway's faster. You just take the one, and transfer to the two-three.",6,How I Met Your Mother,104,19
33301,Ted,4," Well, the bus runs more often on weekends. Take the M-7 to the M-5.",6,How I Met Your Mother,68,14
33302,Barney,4," The bus? Every time I take the bus, there is one crazy person no one wants to sit near. That's why I have never taken the bus. Plus... I can run faster than a bus.",6,How I Met Your Mother,164,35
33303,Ted,4," Dude, that's, like, seven miles. You can't do that. You can't beat the bus!",6,How I Met Your Mother,76,14
33304,Marshall,4, I can beat a bus or a cab or a train!,6,How I Met Your Mother,38,11
33305,Robin,4, Is anyone else suddenly craving green eggs and ham?,6,How I Met Your Mother,52,9
33306,Marshall,4," Machines are overrated, and someone needs to take them down a peg.",6,How I Met Your Mother,67,12
33307,Barney,4," You're all wrong... I got a way to get there so fast, I could beat all of you, even if I sat down and ordered a big, juicy steak first.",6,How I Met Your Mother,136,30
33308,Marshall,4, How?,6,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
33309,Barney,4," Medium rare. But that's not important right now. Look, I know the city better than any of you guys, okay?",6,How I Met Your Mother,106,20
33310,Lily,4," Oh, my God!",6,How I Met Your Mother,12,3
33311,Barney,4," Oh, wow!",6,How I Met Your Mother,9,2
33312,Ted,4," All right, all right, hold on, hold on! Let's just forget about it. Who cares? I mean, there's no way to find out who's right anyway. First person there wins! Doesn't matter how you get there!",6,How I Met Your Mother,193,36
33313,Barney,4,  Stay sad! I'll be back!,6,How I Met Your Mother,25,5

33416,Barney,4," What, you really had something to talk about?",6,How I Met Your Mother,46,8
33417,Robin,4," Yes. Look, I've spent the last,six years in this city, focusing on my career, all for nothing. Some lady almost got me killed. Maury Povich stole my cab. I swear, this city is starting to reject me like a bad organ transplant. You know, everyone keeps saying that I'm not a real New Yorker. Well, maybe I should just stop trying.",6,How I Met Your Mother,330,61
33418,Barney,4," Robin, I had no idea.",6,How I Met Your Mother,22,5

33448,Barney,4, Faster. Mush! Mush! I need this win. I need this win.,6,How I Met Your Mother,54,11
33450,Barney,4," And firing half my department freed up the money to double my own salary. And this chick from Boston was wicked hot in bed last night, and I'm getting more muscular, even though I've stopped working out, and I've got this amazing poker group.",6,How I Met Your Mother,243,44
33452,Barney,4," And I smell incredible. Smell me. Just, seriously, smell me.",6,How I Met Your Mother,61,10

33459,Lily,4," You've had a rough year. But you're tough. And I love you like crazy. If you left, I'd have to follow you. And Marshall would follow me. And Ted would follow him. The only upside is that we might get rid of Barney. Bring it in.",6,How I Met Your Mother,228,46
33460,Robin,4, What did he say?,6,How I Met Your Mother,17,4
33461,Lily,4," No clue. Hey, is that Maury Povich?",6,How I Met Your Mother,36,7
33463,Robin,4, Hey! Lily.,6,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
33464,Lily,4," Sorry, sweetie. I swear I'll be a great friend at the finish line, but the conductor just said you're going express to Borough Hall, which means you're screwed, sweetie. So long, sucker.  Damn it.  Hey, it's Lily. Help me.",6,How I Met Your Mother,223,39
33466,Ted,4," And not a single passenger would listen to me. I mean, am I a bad teacher? Do I just put people to sleep?",6,How I Met Your Mother,106,23
33469,Marshall,4, The machines have won! he machines have won.,6,How I Met Your Mother,45,8
33471,Marshall,4, I can't do it. I can't run that far. I can't outrace anything. I... I can't... I can't get my wife pregnant!,6,How I Met Your Mother,109,22
33472,Ted,4, Wait. Is that what this whole stupid running thing has been about?,6,How I Met Your Mother,67,12
33473,Marshall,4," My body has been letting me down, and I just wanted to prove that it could still do something, but it can't.",6,How I Met Your Mother,109,22
33474,Ted,4," Dude, you've been trying for two months, not two years. That's nothing.",6,How I Met Your Mother,72,12
33475,Marshall,4," Well, you should talk. You know, you're the one who's freaking out because you have one mediocre review and, like, 50 great ones.",6,How I Met Your Mother,130,23
33476,Ted,4, 64. But whatever.,6,How I Met Your Mother,18,3
33477,Marshall,4," And you're designing a frickin' building. I mean, come on, dude.",6,How I Met Your Mother,65,11
33480,Lily,4," Marshall! Marshall, get in!",6,How I Met Your Mother,28,4

33495,Lily,4, Run him over.,6,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
33497,Marshall,4," No. Lily, what the hell is the matter with you?",6,How I Met Your Mother,48,10
33498,Lily,4, Nothing. I just want to win this really badly. So badly that I just ditched my best friend when she needed me.,6,How I Met Your Mother,111,22
33499,Marshall,4," Oh, baby, you were also going to run over Ted.",6,How I Met Your Mother,47,10
33500,Lily,4, Why did I get so crazy about this?,6,How I Met Your Mother,35,8
33501,Marshall,4," Maybe for the same reason that I kept saying that I could run seven miles. I... I'm trying to be really, um, confident and positive about all this, but, baby, I'm really scared that we're not pregnant yet.",6,How I Met Your Mother,206,38
33502,Lily,4," Oh, thank God. I keep thinking there's something wrong with me.",6,How I Met Your Mother,64,11

33505,Marshall,4, We are crazy.,6,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
33506,Lily,4, We're totally crazy.,6,How I Met Your Mother,21,3
33507,Marshall,4, This is the last time it's ever going to be just the two of us. Shouldn't we be enjoying that?,6,How I Met Your Mother,95,20
33508,Lily,4, We gotta go back to Paris.,6,How I Met Your Mother,27,6
33509,Marshall,4, And take ballroom dancing.,6,How I Met Your Mother,27,4
33510,Lily,4, And really learn how to ski. Not just up and get faced in the lodge.,6,How I Met Your Mother,69,15

33512,Lily,4," Oh, a cradle list.",6,How I Met Your Mother,19,4

33530,Robin,4," Damn it, Max. That's Maury Povich.",6,How I Met Your Mother,35,6
33535,Ted,5," I love your idea about a giant rooftop ring of fire you can jump through with a motorcycle, but I tweaked it slightly and... This is still super bad-ass. It's now a patio garden where you can bring a nice bag lunch.",6,How I Met Your Mother,216,42
33536,Barney,5, Sick. Yeah. Dude. Working together is gonna be legen... Wait for it. I'll send you an inter-office memo with the rest 'cause we freakin' work together!,6,How I Met Your Mother,152,26

33554,Marshall,5," Oh, yeah.",6,How I Met Your Mother,10,2
33555,Lily,5," Oh, baby. No, no. Not the slipper socks with the rubber soles. I work so hard to-to set the mood, and-and when I see those, I feel the egg go right back up my Fallopian tube.",6,How I Met Your Mother,175,36
33556,Marshall,5," Baby, these satin sheets are slippery. Papa needs traction.",6,How I Met Your Mother,60,9

33559,Lily,5," Please stop calling yourself ""Papa.""",6,How I Met Your Mother,37,5
33560,Marshall,5," And without traction, Papa's likely to boogie himself right out of bed. It's either these or soccer cleats.",6,How I Met Your Mother,108,18
33561,Lily,5," Hey, so I talked to Robin. I guess she and Max hooked up last night.",6,How I Met Your Mother,69,15

33568,Lily,5," Oh, the small pen1s thing?",6,How I Met Your Mother,27,5
33569,Marshall,5," Ah! Don't! Stop saying that! Why do you keep saying that? You... I don't want to know that. I'm not going to be able to look the guy in the eye. I'm certainly not going to be able to call him ""Max.""",6,How I Met Your Mother,199,42

33573,Barney,5, You're kidding me.,6,How I Met Your Mother,19,3
33574,Ted,5," I'm sorry. I can't do this if it means tearing down The Arcadian. It's an architectural landmark. Plus, people live there. How does GNB plan to get hundreds of residents to just up and leave?",6,How I Met Your Mother,192,35
33575,Barney,5, Snakes.,6,How I Met Your Mother,8,1
33576,Ted,5," Did you just say ""snakes""?",6,How I Met Your Mother,27,5

33578,Ted,5, New is always better?,6,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
33579,Barney,5, You know who's a million times hotter than the hottest girl I've ever slept with? Her okay-looking friend I haven't seen naked. Why? Because new is always better.,6,How I Met Your Mother,163,28
33580,Ted,5, Mm-hmm? And this theory applies to everything?,6,How I Met Your Mother,47,7
33581,Barney,5, Everything.,6,How I Met Your Mother,12,1
33582,Ted,5," So, those new Star Wars movies... Those are better than the old ones?",6,How I Met Your Mother,70,13
33583,Barney,5, Yeah. The first three barely mention the intricacies of intergalactic trade law.,6,How I Met Your Mother,81,12
33584,Ted,5," And when you're at a Guns n' Roses concert, you're like, ""Yeah, yeah, Paradise City, whatever. When are they gonna rock me some Chinese Democracy""?",6,How I Met Your Mother,148,25

33590,Ted,5," Your call, buddy.",6,How I Met Your Mother,18,3
33591,Barney,5," A glass of the J-Jumbo Jim's Grape Scotch sounds lovely. Lots of ice. New is always better, Ted! That's a rule. Just like bigger is always better!",6,How I Met Your Mother,147,27
33593,Marshall,5," Pff. That's not true. Uh, sometimes smaller is better. ""Hey, look how big my cell phone is!"" You don't hear people say that. No. You want something compact and efficient that fits comfortably in your pocket, and I think Max is just a great guy.",6,How I Met Your Mother,245,45
33594,Robin,5, Lily told you.,6,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
33595,Ted,5, Told him what?,6,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
33596,Lily,5, Max has a small pen1s.,6,How I Met Your Mother,23,5
33597,Barney,5, How can you speak of such things?,6,How I Met Your Mother,34,7

33601,Barney,5, How can you speak of such things?,6,How I Met Your Mother,34,7
33602,Lily,5," You're kidding. Barney, every time I mention a woman you don't know, the first thing you say is, ""Boobs?"" Not the complete sentence, ""Does she have big boobs?"" Which also would not be great. Just",6,How I Met Your Mother,196,35
33603,Barney,5, I do not do that.,6,How I Met Your Mother,18,5
33604,Lily,5, My friend Lori from work...,6,How I Met Your Mother,28,5
33605,Barney,5, Boobs? Damn it. But... seriously. Boobs?,6,How I Met Your Mother,41,6

33607,Marshall,5, Impossible. Max's pen1s is stuck in my brain like a splinter. Like a splinter-sized splinter.,6,How I Met Your Mother,94,15

33610,Barney,5," I still don't get this. Why, all of a sudden, out of nowhere, do you want to ruin... Wait a minute. Who's the girl?",6,How I Met Your Mother,116,24
33611,Robin,5, Duh. Of course there's a girl.,6,How I Met Your Mother,31,6

33633,Ted,5," Well, I'd say you got a pretty long wait.",6,How I Met Your Mother,42,9
33636,Barney,5," Oh, Ted, that's so romantic. I want to fill a pillowcase with dead batteries and beat you with it.",6,How I Met Your Mother,99,19
33639,Ted,5, Anything.,6,How I Met Your Mother,10,1
33642,Barney,5, And you said...?,6,How I Met Your Mother,17,3
33644,Ted,5, Where do I sign?,6,How I Met Your Mother,17,4
33646,Barney,5," Hmm. Grape scotch. Not bad. Ted, you only think The Arcadian needs to be saved because some pretty girl thinks that. And seriously... Boobs?",6,How I Met Your Mother,141,24
33647,Ted,5, This isn't about the girl. It's about the building.,6,How I Met Your Mother,52,9
33648,Barney,5," And what did this ""Zoey"" say when she found out that you're the one tearing down her beloved Arcadian? That you, Ted Mosby, are the Architect Of Destruction?",6,How I Met Your Mother,158,28
33649,Marshall,5, Whoa! Sweet wrestling name alert.,6,How I Met Your Mother,34,5
33650,Ted,5," Well... Uh, it's a... it's a funny thing about that...",6,How I Met Your Mother,55,10
33653,Ted,5, I'm a veterinarian.,6,How I Met Your Mother,20,3
33655,Ted,5, What? I panicked!,6,How I Met Your Mother,18,3
33656,Barney,5, This whole Arcadian thing is classic Mosby. Changing your personality to fit some girl.,6,How I Met Your Mother,88,14
33657,Ted,5, I don't do that.,6,How I Met Your Mother,17,4
33659,Ted,5," Well, off to meet Steph. We're adrenaline junkies! Penelope is taking me to the Battle of Gettysburg. We're gonna eat squirrel!   Look, she's really hot, okay?",6,How I Met Your Mother,160,26
33661,Ted,5, Aww! Come on! Come on! We all change a little for whoever we're into. Barney pretended to be a rabbi to get laid.,6,How I Met Your Mother,114,23
33662,Barney,5, Asian girls love them some Jews.,6,How I Met Your Mother,33,6
33663,Ted,5, And Marshall never would've listened to The Indigo Girls if it weren't for Lily.,6,How I Met Your Mother,81,14
33664,Lily,5," Um, I think you got that backwards there, Chief.",6,How I Met Your Mother,49,9
33665,Marshall,5, And you're welcome.,6,How I Met Your Mother,20,3
33666,Ted,5," The point is, you weren't pretending to like the Indigo Girls for the other person. You realized you liked them because of the other person. Just like me, Zoey and The Arcadian. Did GNB really put snakes in The Arcadian?",6,How I Met Your Mother,221,40
33667,Barney,5," No. Technically, they were eggs.",6,How I Met Your Mother,33,5
33668,Ted,5," Did you just say ""eggs""?",6,How I Met Your Mother,25,5
33669,Barney,5," I don't recall saying ""eggs.""",6,How I Met Your Mother,30,5
33674,Robin,5," Yeah, I-I think it is so cool that you started your own law firm.",6,How I Met Your Mother,66,14
33676,Marshall,5," Hey, hey. I bet it's not that small.",6,How I Met Your Mother,37,8
33678,Marshall,5," Yeah, but, uh, you know what they say. The important thing is-is how you use it, you know? ""The motion of the ocean."" That whole thing.",6,How I Met Your Mother,136,26
33679,Robin,5," He said it's small, Marshall, and everybody's fine with that. Let's just move on.",6,How I Met Your Mother,82,14
33680,Marshall,5, I'm just saying that I bet it's bigger than he thinks. And thick.,6,How I Met Your Mother,66,13
33682,Robin,5, Let's order!,6,How I Met Your Mother,13,2
33685,Ted,5, Zoey... I'm Batman. Hmm. That'd be cool.,6,How I Met Your Mother,41,7
33689,Ted,5, Wasn't expecting bunnies.,6,How I Met Your Mother,26,3
33691,Ted,5, Absolutely. Just let me run up and get my bag of vet supplies. Okay. Why would I say that?,6,How I Met Your Mother,91,19
33694,Marshall,5," Well, spare no expense, buddy. Dinner is on me, and-and get dessert. Maybe this molten chocolate lava cake? I just want you to be happy.",6,How I Met Your Mother,137,25
33696,Robin,5, Totally.,6,How I Met Your Mother,9,1
33697,Marshall,5, We'll just be here. You're great.,6,How I Met Your Mother,34,6
33699,Marshall,5, I know.,6,How I Met Your Mother,8,2
33701,Lily,5," Damn, baby, be cool!",6,How I Met Your Mother,21,4
33702,Robin,5, You're acting like he has six months to live.,6,How I Met Your Mother,46,9
33703,Marshall,5, It's your fault! You ladies and your salty sailor talk!,6,How I Met Your Mother,56,10
33704,Robin,5," Oh, come on! What about you men and your locker room talk?",6,How I Met Your Mother,59,12
33705,Marshall,5, Locker room talk. Do you want to know what it's like in a men's locker room?,6,How I Met Your Mother,77,16
33707,Marshall,5, It's just a bunch of uncomfortable dudes trying to get out of there as quickly as possible. And one old guy just letting it all hang out.,6,How I Met Your Mother,138,27
33709,Lily,5, Are you suggesting that guys don't talk about s*x?,6,How I Met Your Mother,51,9
33710,Marshall,5," Yes, we do, but you know what we say? ""I hit that.""""I got some.""""I tapped it."" ""I squeezed those."" Discreet and efficient.",6,How I Met Your Mother,123,22
33711,Robin,5, Not to mention classy.,6,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
33712,Marshall,5," Thank God that I'm not dating. If I thought that Lily talked in that much detail about our s*x life, I'd probably kill myself. Oh, no. What did you tell her?",6,How I Met Your Mother,158,31
33713,Lily,5," Oh, nothing. We don't talk about you!",6,How I Met Your Mother,38,7
33714,Marshall,5, Are you sure?,6,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
33715,Robin,5, Yeah. That argument has no traction whatsoever.,6,How I Met Your Mother,48,7
33717,Ted,5, You just broke in and stole these guys? Aren't you worried about getting arrested?,6,How I Met Your Mother,83,14
33719,Ted,5, Wow. You're a little bit crazy.,6,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
33721,Ted,5," Yeah. Yeah. Although I hear there's a lovely rooftop patio where folks can enjoy a nice bag lunch, so...",6,How I Met Your Mother,105,19
33724,Barney,5," Ted, this woman is an anarchist, a sociopath, a lunatic, and for the love of God, boobs?!",6,How I Met Your Mother,90,17
33725,Ted,5," Solid C-cup, perky bounce.",6,How I Met Your Mother,27,4
33726,Barney,5, Momentary grudging respect.,6,How I Met Your Mother,28,3
33727,Ted,5," Zoey does what she believes is right, and I want to do the same thing. We have to find a new site for this building.",6,How I Met Your Mother,117,25
33728,Barney,5," Ted, that is never gonna happen.",6,How I Met Your Mother,33,6
33729,Ted,5," Well, I can't tear down The Arcadian. I'm sorry, but I'm off the project.",6,How I Met Your Mother,74,14
33733,Ted,5, Hey.,6,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
33735,Ted,5," Well, you really got to me the other night. I want to get involved with ""Save The Arcadian.""",6,How I Met Your Mother,93,18
33740,Ted,5," She was really hot, okay?",6,How I Met Your Mother,26,5
33743,Ted,5, How the hell could you do that?,6,How I Met Your Mother,32,7
33744,Barney,5, Simple. I rented the chair. The bunny was here already. That was lucky. I waited to do the dramatic swivel until I heard your key enter the door.,6,How I Met Your Mother,146,28
33745,Ted,5," The billboard, Barney.",6,How I Met Your Mother,23,3
33746,Barney,5," I had to. Now that you have no shot with the girl, you'll realize you never cared about the building, and everything can go back to normal.",6,How I Met Your Mother,140,27
33747,Ted,5, You're wrong. I do care. And I'm still quitting.,6,How I Met Your Mother,49,9
33748,Barney,5," Don't you get it, Ted? We're tearing down The Arcadian either way. It's a stupid old piece-of-crap, run-down, snake-infested dump!",6,How I Met Your Mother,131,20
33749,Ted,5," Okay, are there or aren't there snakes?!",6,How I Met Your Mother,41,7
33750,Barney,5, Who mentioned snakes?! And stop shouting! You're scaring Cottontail.,6,How I Met Your Mother,69,9
33751,Ted,5, You named the rabbit?,6,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
33752,Barney,5," You took longer to get here than I thought, we bonded, I'm keeping her. The point is, you now have a chance to design your own building. Dude, you can do whatever you want with it.",6,How I Met Your Mother,181,36
33753,Ted,5, You're right. You're right. I can design it however I want.,6,How I Met Your Mother,60,11
33754,Barney,5, So you're back in?,6,How I Met Your Mother,19,4
33755,Ted,5, Yeah.,6,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
33759,Lily,5," Ugh, he thinks I like this...But it feels disgusting.",6,How I Met Your Mother,54,9
33760,Robin,5," Uh, it looks disgusting.",6,How I Met Your Mother,25,4
33761,Marshall,5," Uh, is this working for you?",6,How I Met Your Mother,29,6
33762,Lily,5," ""Uh, is this working for you?""",6,How I Met Your Mother,31,6
33763,Robin,5," Oh, of course, because what woman doesn't like being slobbered on while some giant paws at her nether regions like Lenny from Of Mice and Men?",6,How I Met Your Mother,143,26
33764,Lily,5," Oh, you're bad.",6,How I Met Your Mother,16,3
33765,Robin,5, More Cosmos?,6,How I Met Your Mother,13,2
33766,Marshall,5, I can't... I can't do this! I can't stop thinking about you and Robin!,6,How I Met Your Mother,71,14
33767,Lily,5," Oh, I've had that a couple times. Just lean into it and let it fuel things.",6,How I Met Your Mother,76,16
33768,Marshall,5," Look, no. You know what? Why don't you just... Why don't you just call Robin, okay, and have a good laugh about it? Whoa! Traction could have prevented that.",6,How I Met Your Mother,158,29
33771,Ted,5," Well, that explains a few voicemails. Listen, Zoey, I think we can save The Arcadian. No. Maybe not in the way you were picturing, but I stayed up all night working on a new concept, all right? What if my design could incorporate The Arcadian's facade into the new GNB headquarters?",6,How I Met Your Mother,283,51
33773,Ted,5, Are you married?,6,How I Met Your Mother,17,3
33776,Ted,5, This isn't about the girl. It's about the building.,6,How I Met Your Mother,52,9
33778,Ted,5," Yeah, it was about the girl.",6,How I Met Your Mother,29,6
33780,Ted,5," This wouldn't work. Zoey, The Arcadian was a really great building once, but it's falling apart, and it's full of snakes.",6,How I Met Your Mother,122,21
33782,Ted,5, I don't recall saying snakes.,6,How I Met Your Mother,30,5
33784,Lily,5," Then he gets this panicked look on his face, says, ""I can't do this,"" and storms out.",6,How I Met Your Mother,86,17
33785,Robin,5," Wow, that is weird.",6,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
33786,Lily,5, But here's the crazier part.,6,How I Met Your Mother,29,5
33788,Marshall,5, No. You know what? Papa don't back down from a fight. So why don't you tell Robin... about this!,6,How I Met Your Mother,97,19
33790,Lily,5," It was amazing. He was passionate, animalistic, a complete stud.",6,How I Met Your Mother,65,10
33791,Robin,5," Wow. So he's right there making you say all this, huh?",6,How I Met Your Mother,55,11
33792,Lily,5," Yup. ""'You're like a Greek god, I moaned, as the..."" I can't read that, baby.",6,How I Met Your Mother,78,15
33793,Marshall,5," ""Musky scent of man.""",6,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
33794,Lily,5," ""As the musky scent of man and Marshall's sure-footed traction intoxicated and overpowered me.""",6,How I Met Your Mother,96,14
33795,Robin,5, That sounds real.,6,How I Met Your Mother,18,3
33802,Marshall,5, How's it going with Robin?,6,How I Met Your Mother,27,5
33804,Marshall,5, Really? Why? You with her?,6,How I Met Your Mother,27,5
33806,Ted,5," Hey, what's not for everyone?",6,How I Met Your Mother,30,5
33807,Marshall,5," Guys, come on. What is it?",6,How I Met Your Mother,27,6
33809,Marshall,5," I... What do you think it was, Murray?",6,How I Met Your Mother,39,8
33812,Marshall,6," So, have you guys landed on a name yet?",6,How I Met Your Mother,40,9
33820,Marshall,6," Stuart, you are so... That's not gonna be us, right? I mean, how hard can it be to name a baby?",6,How I Met Your Mother,96,21
33821,Lily,6," Right? I mean, just look at her. Yeah. She's clearly a...",6,How I Met Your Mother,58,11
33822,Marshall,6, Emily.,6,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
33823,Lily,6, Lisa.,6,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
33824,Marshall,6, Lisa?!,6,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
33825,Lily,6, Emily?!,6,How I Met Your Mother,8,1
33828,Marshall,6, Okay! I made a list of awesome baby names. Starting at the top,6,How I Met Your Mother,63,13
33829,Ted,6," I'm gonna stop you right here, Marshall. You name a chubby white kid ""LeBron,"" and he's the one getting stuffed in the basketball hoop.",6,How I Met Your Mother,136,24
33830,Marshall,6," Then I'm also crossing off, um, ""Shaquille""... Mm-hmm. ""Hakeem,"" and ""Dikembe."" Hey, what about ""Rob""?",6,How I Met Your Mother,103,15
33831,Lily,6," ""Rob""? No.",6,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
33832,Marshall,6, Why not?,6,How I Met Your Mother,9,2
33835,Lily,6," Hey, Rob. What are you gonna make? A turkey?",6,How I Met Your Mother,45,9
33839,Lily,6," Not ""Rob.""",6,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
33840,Marshall,6," um, how about ""Ryan""?",6,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
33841,Ted,6, Ooh.,6,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
33845,Lily,6," Not ""Ryan.""",6,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
33846,Marshall,6," ""Johnny?""",6,How I Met Your Mother,10,1
33848,Lily,6," Hey, where's the goldfish?",6,How I Met Your Mother,27,4
33851,Lily,6," Not ""Johnny."" Or ""Gil.""",6,How I Met Your Mother,24,4
33852,Marshall,6," ""Jeremy.""",6,How I Met Your Mother,10,1
33854,Lily,6," Jeremy, no!",6,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
33857,Lily,6," Definitely not ""Jeremy."" His stuff was so derivative.",6,How I Met Your Mother,54,8
33859,Marshall,6," Well, I mean, geez, Lily.",6,How I Met Your Mother,26,5
33860,Robin,6," Well, whatever you do, do not name your baby ""Becky,"" right?",6,How I Met Your Mother,61,11
33861,Marshall,6, Why? What?,6,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
33862,Robin,6, Becky. My new co-anchor? Don't you guys ever watch the show?,6,How I Met Your Mother,61,11
33863,Lily,6," Oh, honey, I really try.",6,How I Met Your Mother,25,5
33864,Marshall,6, Our DVR won't recognize it as a television program.,6,How I Met Your Mother,52,9
33865,Ted,6," I watched. Robin insisted I confirm how ""awful"" Becky is, so last night I checked it out.",6,How I Met Your Mother,90,17
33867,Robin,6," Peace talks in the region have been described as, ""productive."" Becky?",6,How I Met Your Mother,71,11
33869,Robin,6," Becky, we're-we're journalists. We can't get emotional about the news, we...",6,How I Met Your Mother,77,11
33871,Robin,6," Well, if you read the story, we might find out.",6,How I Met Your Mother,48,10
33874,Robin,6," Okay, no holds barred-- what'd you think of Becky?",6,How I Met Your Mother,51,9
33875,Ted,6, Mmm...  I thought she was charming.,6,How I Met Your Mother,36,6
33876,Robin,6," You, too? Can somebody please explain to me why the little girl act works on men?",6,How I Met Your Mother,82,16
33877,Barney,6, You want the long version or the short version?,6,How I Met Your Mother,48,9
33878,Lily,6, Short version.,6,How I Met Your Mother,15,2
33879,Barney,6, Short version. Who's your daddy?,6,How I Met Your Mother,33,5
33880,Lily,6," You know, when you think about that, that phrase is really creepy.",6,How I Met Your Mother,67,12
33881,Marshall,6," No, it's not. It's fun. Here, watch this. Hey, Lily... Who's your daddy?",6,How I Met Your Mother,73,13
33882,Robin,6," Okay, uh, let me get this straight. So, in, uh, in this scenario, because you make such sweet love to Lily, she is now your daughter.",6,How I Met Your Mother,134,26
33883,Marshall,6," No, she is not my daughter. I'm just her daddy.",6,How I Met Your Mother,48,10
33884,Ted,6, Wow. That is disgusting.,6,How I Met Your Mother,25,4
33885,Robin,6," Exactly. And it's not like the opposite would work. There's no way a guy could pick up a girl, going around talking like a little boy.",6,How I Met Your Mother,135,26
33886,Barney,6, Challenge accepted.,6,How I Met Your Mother,20,2
33887,Robin,6, No.,6,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
33888,Barney,6," I, Barney Stinson, will pick up a girl whilst talking like a little boy.",6,How I Met Your Mother,73,14
33890,Lily,6, Okay. Here's my list of baby names.,6,How I Met Your Mother,36,7
33891,Marshall,6, Oh.,6,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
33892,Lily,6," What about ""Tara""?",6,How I Met Your Mother,19,3
33893,Marshall,6," No. Not ""Tara."" Tara was the hottest girl in my high school. We were all, like, obsessed with her.",6,How I Met Your Mother,99,19
33895,Marshall,6, We didn't just talk about her and fantasize about her... We wrote songs about her.,6,How I Met Your Mother,83,15
33898,Marshall,6," Not ""Tara.""",6,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
33899,Lily,6," What about ""Esther""?",6,How I Met Your Mother,21,3
33902,Marshall,6," Oh. Oh. Hey, Barney. That prime rib was surprisingly good, but it's 10",6,How I Met Your Mother,71,13
33903,Barney,6," Oh, Esther gets naked. But she doesn't dance.",6,How I Met Your Mother,46,8
33904,Marshall,6, Then what does she do? Sweet mother nature!,6,How I Met Your Mother,44,8
33905,Barney,6, That was my card!,6,How I Met Your Mother,18,4
33909,Marshall,6," Not ""Esther."" I need a drink. Ted? Ted?",6,How I Met Your Mother,40,8
33911,Ted,6," Marshall, your list is entirely boy names. You do realize there's roughly a 50% chance of you having a daughter, right?",6,How I Met Your Mother,120,21
33912,Marshall,6," Okay, honestly, I've never thought about having a girl. I don't want to think about having a girl. Tara, Esther -- can you imagine being one of those girls' dads?",6,How I Met Your Mother,163,30
33918,Marshall,6," I have no idea how to raise a daughter! What if she makes bad choices? I mean, what if she winds up dating some... Oh, God.",6,How I Met Your Mother,124,26
33920,Barney,6," Hey, bro. Thanks for making such a hottie.  Who's your daddy?",6,How I Met Your Mother,62,11
33923,Marshall,6, I don't want a girl. I just want a little boy.,6,How I Met Your Mother,47,11
33924,Ted,6," It's not what it sounds like, folks.",6,How I Met Your Mother,37,7
33926,Marshall,6," Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad.",6,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
33928,Marshall,6,"Oh, okay, um... You guys, you're a little too close to the camera. Can you back up a bit?",6,How I Met Your Mother,89,19
33930,Marshall,6," Every time. Um, can you just sit in front of the computer like normal human beings? Perfect! Perfect.",6,How I Met Your Mother,102,18
33932,Marshall,6," Um, to be honest, I'm getting a little freaked out about the idea of having a daughter. I know you two probably aren't the right people to talk to about this. You had all boys.",6,How I Met Your Mother,177,35
33935,Marshall,6," I'm in a computer, Mom.",6,How I Met Your Mother,24,5
33938,Marshall,6," Okay... No offense, Dad, but I doubt there's any scientific data to support--",6,How I Met Your Mother,78,13
33941,Robin,6, Members of the G-8 convened today in Vienna to discuss plans to fight climate change by re... What?,6,How I Met Your Mother,100,18
33943,Robin,6," Hey, Becky, Becky, this is our news segment, okay? Nobody cares what you did yesterday.",6,How I Met Your Mother,88,15
33945,Robin,6, Mike!,6,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
33947,Robin,6," Okay, back to the G-8 conference. Hello? Mike, can I get in the shot? Fantastic.",6,How I Met Your Mother,81,15
33949,Robin,6,Wait-- did you go out with Ted Mosby?,6,How I Met Your Mother,37,8
33951,Robin,6,"In other news, later today, a Manhattan architect gets punched in the throat.",6,How I Met Your Mother,77,13
33954,Ted,6, Ow!,6,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
33955,Robin,6," Ted, of all the women in New York, you had to go out with an eight-year-old girl?",6,How I Met Your Mother,82,17
33956,Ted,6," Not what it sounds like, folks.",6,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
33957,Robin,6," Ted, you know that I hate her. How could you go out on a date with this girl?",6,How I Met Your Mother,78,18
33958,Ted,6, It wasn't a date. She came over to the apartment looking for you.,6,How I Met Your Mother,66,13
33961,Ted,6, Aww...,6,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
33964,Robin,6, Let me guess,6,How I Met Your Mother,13,3
33965,Ted,6, I don't know if that's totally true.,6,How I Met Your Mother,37,7
33967,Ted,6," It's okay, little darlin'.",6,How I Met Your Mother,27,4
33969,Ted,6," Hey, hey, hey, hey. Spiders gotta die so trees can grow.",6,How I Met Your Mother,57,11
33971,Ted,6," Then I held her tight and told her it was all gonna be okay. By the way, I think I only wounded the spider. It crawled off into my bedroom.",6,How I Met Your Mother,140,30

33996,Robin,6," Oh, but you find it irresistible when Becky does? I don't get it. The Ted that I went out with was attracted to the kind of woman who could use a steak knife without supervision.",6,How I Met Your Mother,179,35
33997,Ted,6," For your information, Becky doesn't like steak, she likes pasghetti. Spaghetti. And more importantly, she makes me feel needed.",6,How I Met Your Mother,128,19
33998,Robin,6, Needed?  She makes training wheels feel needed.,6,How I Met Your Mother,48,7

34030,Marshall,6,  Let's make a baby!,6,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
34031,Lily,6," Whoa! Baby, you're packing snowballs, and your breath smells like a mermaid fart.",6,How I Met Your Mother,82,13

34039,Lily,6," All my least favorite students have been boys. So I Googled ""how to make a girl some really weird stuff came up but finally, I found this conception Web site that said you should point south at the moment of conception... eat a lemon......and heat up your lady parts to a balmy 105 degrees.  Ooh... ah... Oh, that's not bad.",6,How I Met Your Mother,325,60
34040,Marshall,6," Lily, how could you do... exactly the same thing I did? You're supposed to be the sane one.",6,How I Met Your Mother,92,18
34041,Lily,6, See that? Another boy expecting a woman to clean up his mistakes. That's why girls are way better than boys.,6,How I Met Your Mother,109,20
34042,Marshall,6," Oh, really. Well, then how come whenever there's a creepy kid in a horror movie it's always a little girl? Or twin girls, who speak... ",6,How I Met Your Mother,136,25

34050,Robin,6," That's what I thought. Uh, I'm sorry.",6,How I Met Your Mother,38,7
34051,Barney,6," Wait, where are you... That's a compliment. You are the least needy woman I've ever met-- that's awesome. I mean, no guy's gonna say ""Who's your daddy?"" to Robin Scherbatsky. You're your own daddy. And mommy. And weird survivalist uncle who lives in a cabin with a shotgun blaming stuff on the government. And that is what makes you the most... amazing, strong... independent woman I've ever banged.",6,How I Met Your Mother,400,68

34181,Marshall,7," Okay, that, that right there. That attitude is exactly why I won't be in your video. Because GNB doesn't care. They hand out pink slips like they're hors d'oevres. Just last week, I was talking to Arthur...",6,How I Met Your Mother,207,37
34186,Marshall,7," GNB treats people like they're disposable, and I will not be a part of that. Marshall Eriksen does not fire people, period.",6,How I Met Your Mother,124,22

34214,Lily,7, He and that little stuffed horsey raised all kinds of hell. But I have a simple method for shutting down troublemakers. You know that '98 Taurus that's always parked outside? The one with the really annoying alarm?,6,How I Met Your Mother,215,37

34241,Lily,7," Your co-host is getting super-popular because of her stupid commercial, ""Boats! Boats! Boats!""

34259,Marshall,7," No, sir, that is what's wrong with this company. How can we say ""GNB Cares,"" and then turn around and treat someone like that?

And you didn't fire Tugboat, did you?",6,How I Met Your Mother,296,55

34278,Lily,7, And did it work?,6,How I Met Your Mother,17,4
34279,Ted,7," Like gangbusters. We're buddies again. After class, we hacked a little sack to the thumpin' strains of my Prof Rock CD. And no, none of them had heard the Pixies B-side. Actually, none of them had heard of the Pixies. Or a B-side.",6,How I Met Your Mother,231,43

34410,Barney,8," I was six. My uncle Jerry brought me here for the day. He said, ""Don't touch anything"". To a kid. That's like someone telling us ""Don't look at that girl's perky and impossibly symmetrical knockers.""",6,How I Met Your Mother,200,35
34412,Robin,8, Not bad.,6,How I Met Your Mother,9,2
34413,Barney,8," So, naturally, I snapped the rib off a triceratops, blahbity-blahbity-blue, I knocked down the whale. I'm surprised security didn't stop me on the way in.",6,How I Met Your Mother,155,25

34462,Robin,8," Mmm. Ah, this Scotch is good. How's your drink?",6,How I Met Your Mother,48,9

34464,Robin,8, You're right.,6,How I Met Your Mother,14,2

34550,Ted,8," No, you know what? Don't erase the tape. And for what it's worth, I don't think she's throwing temper tantrums. I just think she's, you know, standing up for what she believes in. I respect that.",6,How I Met Your Mother,196,36

34581,Lily,8, Hi.,6,How I Met Your Mother,4,1

34643,Barney,9," No, of course not. I wanted my first time to be with someone I cared about.",6,How I Met Your Mother,76,16
34644,Marshall,9," Sweet! I get that a lot. Well, once.",6,How I Met Your Mother,37,8
34645,Lily,9," Hey, Robin, do you want to go get a Korean massage on Saturday?",6,How I Met Your Mother,64,13
34646,Robin,9," Oh, I'd love to. I've got this knot in my neck that's so annoying.",6,How I Met Your Mother,67,14
34647,Lily,9," Yeah, I figured I should get one now because once I get pregnant, no more massages. Just so annoying.",6,How I Met Your Mother,102,19
34649,Barney,9, Space Teens?! Is this a porno?,6,How I Met Your Mother,31,6
34650,Robin,9," No, no. Dude, dude. Sweet! It's a kids' show.",6,How I Met Your Mother,46,9
34651,Ted,9," I don't know. This does have all the earmarks of p0rn. Stripper pole, bad lighting, delusional girl who thinks it's a stepping stone to mainstream success.",6,How I Met Your Mother,156,26
34652,Barney,9," Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a big old bowl of pornflakes. Whoa! And who is this exquisite keytarist I assum you're about to make sweet love to?",6,How I Met Your Mother,139,26
34653,Robin,9," Oh, that's Jessica Glitter. She was my BFF on the show and in real life.",6,How I Met Your Mother,73,15
34654,Barney,9," Ah, BFFs. Did you guys have sleepovers? Get mad at each other and wrestle, but then end up kissing in a tender embrace? Here, show us on Lily.",6,How I Met Your Mother,143,28
34655,Robin,9," Barney, you know what? If you're going to be disgusting, we're not watching this, okay?",6,How I Met Your Mother,88,15
34656,Lily,9," Yeah. Come on, Barney. It's just a cute little story about... What exactly is this about?",6,How I Met Your Mother,90,16
34657,Robin,9," Oh, two average Canadian teenagers who solve crimes in space using math.",6,How I Met Your Mother,73,12
34658,Marshall,9, That sounds ridiculous.,6,How I Met Your Mother,24,3
34664,Lily,9," Oh. Oh. I have to say, as much as I hate to agree with Barney, this does seem to be a veritable pornucopia.",6,How I Met Your Mother,108,23
34665,Robin,9," Okay, guys, come on. It's a kids' show! Like Electric Company or Sesame Street or, um...",6,How I Met Your Mother,89,16
34666,Marshall,9, You can't do that on television.,6,How I Met Your Mother,33,6
34667,Robin,9, Exactly.,6,How I Met Your Mother,9,1
34668,Marshall,9, No. You can't do that on television!,6,How I Met Your Mother,37,7
34669,Ted,9," Robin, this show is so dirty, I don't know whether to hug you or run a shower for you so you can sit there alone, crying and clenching your knees.",6,How I Met Your Mother,147,30
34670,Robin,9," It's just bad camera work, okay? Wayne, our camera guy... he wasn't that great.",6,How I Met Your Mother,80,14
34671,Marshall,9," I don't know. I think he did a pretty good job, considering he was probably only using one hand.",6,How I Met Your Mother,97,19
34672,Robin,9," You know what? I feel bad for you Americans, that you can look at this wondrous and educational adventure through space, and see something obscene. Can you just please try to look at this with the innocence of a child?",6,How I Met Your Mother,219,40
34681,Barney,9," I'm sorry. We got to ration this. It's like we're on a desert island, and this video is a really hot, naked chick, and she's got, like, seaweed on her and a seashell bra. You all feel me?",6,How I Met Your Mother,188,38
34682,Lily,9," Hey, if you and Jessica are BFFs, how come we've never met her?",6,How I Met Your Mother,64,13
34683,Robin,9," Okay, well, it was a long time ago, okay? I get a Christmas card from her every year, but we're not really friends anymore.",6,How I Met Your Mother,124,24
34684,Lily,9, But BFFs are forever.,6,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
34685,Marshall,9," Oh, come on, Lily. Nobody stays friends with their high school friends.",6,How I Met Your Mother,72,12
34686,Ted,9, I'm still friends with Punchy.,6,How I Met Your Mother,31,5
34687,Marshall,9," Dude, he lives in Cleveland. You see him once a year, at which point, he punches you really hard in the arm and tells everyone how you dookied your pants. I know, on paper he sounds great, but you guys aren't really friends.",6,How I Met Your Mother,225,43
34688,Ted,9," Look, I may not see him a lot, but it doesn't matter. Observe.",6,How I Met Your Mother,63,13
34691,Ted,9, Punchy!,6,How I Met Your Mother,8,1
34693,Ted,9," Yeah, you, too. If you're ever in New York.",6,How I Met Your Mother,44,9
34696,Ted,9, We are just two peas.,6,How I Met Your Mother,22,5
34697,Lily,9, I don't get it. How can you and Glitter just stop being friends? Best friends don't do that.,6,How I Met Your Mother,93,18
34698,Robin,9," Well, we did, okay? And I haven't talked to her in, like, five years, so just drop it. I got to go.",6,How I Met Your Mother,100,22
34699,Lily,9, Whoa. What do you think came between Robin and Jessica?,6,How I Met Your Mother,56,10
34700,Ted,9," Much like our friends, the Space Teens, I think I can solve this crime with math. Okay... Okay, here is a Christmas card that Jessica sent Robin. Lily, how old would you say that kid is?",6,How I Met Your Mother,187,36
34701,Lily,9," Four years, three months.",6,How I Met Your Mother,26,4
34702,Ted,9, Which means Jessica got pregnant five years ago. Right around the time she and Robin stopped being friends.,6,How I Met Your Mother,108,18
34703,Marshall,9, Of course. Robin hates kids.,6,How I Met Your Mother,29,5
34704,Barney,9, The last thing she would want to do is hang out with some little brat.,6,How I Met Your Mother,71,15
34705,Ted,9," Thus, if I may... When Glitter's womb a fruit did bear, Robin said, ""To hell with this, I'm outta hare. Glitter got pregnant, so Robin dumped her.",6,How I Met Your Mother,147,27
34706,Marshall,9," That's got to be it, right, Lil? Lil?",6,How I Met Your Mother,38,8
34707,Lily,9, Robin's gonna dump me!,6,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
34708,Marshall,9," Oh, sweetheart.",6,How I Met Your Mother,16,2
34709,Ted,9, When a second uterus plumped becomes...,6,How I Met Your Mother,40,6
34710,Marshall,9, Dude. Feel the room.,6,How I Met Your Mother,21,4
34712,Robin,9, No.,6,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
34713,Ted,9, We've been waiting all day!,6,How I Met Your Mother,28,5
34714,Robin,9, Just watch it without me.,6,How I Met Your Mother,26,5
34715,Barney,9, Two dudes on the couch together watching p0rn? That's kind of weird.,6,How I Met Your Mother,69,12
34716,Robin,9," Okay, it's not p0rn, it's a kids' show.",6,How I Met Your Mother,40,8
34717,Ted,9, Two dudes watching a kids' show might be worse.,6,How I Met Your Mother,48,9
34718,Robin,9," Okay, fine, I'll watch it with you. Yeah! But if either of you makes even one peep about the show being dirty, I'm turning it off.",6,How I Met Your Mother,131,26
34719,Barney,9, We...,6,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
34720,Robin,9, I'm serious.,6,How I Met Your Mother,13,2
34725,Robin,9, Our characters had pet beavers.,6,How I Met Your Mother,32,5
34726,Ted,9, Sure.,6,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
34727,Robin,9, The beaver is the official animal of Canada. It's our national mascot.,6,How I Met Your Mother,71,12
34728,Barney,9, It's a noble creature.,6,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
34731,Robin,9," Hey! No! You don't get to hear the beaver song! It is a sweet song about friendship, and you guys are being disgusting, and beavers are adorable!",6,How I Met Your Mother,146,27
34732,Barney,9, No arguments here.,6,How I Met Your Mother,19,3
34735,Ted,9," Punchy, what are you doing here?",6,How I Met Your Mother,33,6
34737,Ted,9," Okay, uh, uh, where are you staying?",6,How I Met Your Mother,37,7
34739,Robin,9, Whoa. He's staying here? You're staying here?,6,How I Met Your Mother,46,7
34746,Robin,9," Hey, Schmosby, remember when you dookied on our couch in the form of your idiot high school friend? Unbelievable!",6,How I Met Your Mother,114,19
34747,Ted,9, Come on. I worry about the guy. He's had the same dead-end job at a car rental place for 15 years.,6,How I Met Your Mother,99,21
34748,Robin,9, Don't care.,6,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
34749,Ted,9, He's been stuck in Cleveland his whole life.,6,How I Met Your Mother,45,8
34750,Robin,9, Get a hotel.,6,How I Met Your Mother,13,3
34751,Ted,9, Robin... LeBron.,6,How I Met Your Mother,17,2
34752,Robin,9," Okay, one night. Got to go.",6,How I Met Your Mother,28,6
34754,Lily,9, Where are you going? We just got here.,6,How I Met Your Mother,39,8
34755,Robin,9," Oh, a Korean massage.",6,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
34756,Lily,9, By yourself?,6,How I Met Your Mother,13,2
34757,Robin,9," Well, I figured you'd be busy, reading What to Expect When You're Expecting to Expect.",6,How I Met Your Mother,87,15
34758,Lily,9," Guys, did you see that? She's going to a Korean massage without me. That's our thing. I'm telling you, she's gonna dump me, just like she dumped Glitter.",6,How I Met Your Mother,154,28
34759,Marshall,9," Lily, come on. We don't even know that's what happened.",6,How I Met Your Mother,56,10
34760,Ted,9," Um, hello, somebody already solved that crime using math, remember?",6,How I Met Your Mother,68,10
34761,Marshall,9," Look, Lily. Robin is clearly getting tired of you constantly talking about babies.",6,How I Met Your Mother,83,13
34762,Lily,9, I don't.,6,How I Met Your Mother,9,2
34763,Marshall,9," Lily, how old am I?",6,How I Met Your Mother,20,5
34764,Lily,9, 384 months.,6,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
34766,Marshall,9," Okay. So before you Lily all over the place, maybe you should try hanging out with Robin and not talking about babies.",6,How I Met Your Mother,119,22
34768,Robin,9," Hey, Lily, what brings you to the crib?",6,How I Met Your Mother,40,8
34769,Lily,9, Crib...,6,How I Met Your Mother,8,1
34770,Robin,9, What's the matter? You look rattled.,6,How I Met Your Mother,37,6
34771,Lily,9, Rattled? I want to talk about babies.,6,How I Met Your Mother,38,7
34772,Robin,9, What?,6,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
34773,Lily,9," Look, I know you don't care about this stuff, but I'm about to become a mother. And as a future mother, I'm gonna need the support...",6,How I Met Your Mother,134,26
34774,Robin,9," Oh, my God! You're not even pregnant yet.",6,How I Met Your Mother,42,8
34775,Lily,9, What's that supposed to mean?,6,How I Met Your Mother,30,5
34776,Robin,9," It means that a fertilized egg has not yet attached itself to the lining of your uterine wall. You see? I read your Facebook updates. God, it's like it's all you ever talk about, Lily, and I'm sick of it!",6,How I Met Your Mother,205,40
34777,Lily,9," Well, guess what? I've got some good news. When that baby comes, you don't have to see it. In fact, you don't have to see me. This whole friendship thing? Done.",6,How I Met Your Mother,161,31
34778,Robin,9, Great.,6,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
34779,Lily,9, Great.,6,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
34782,Marshall,9, For crying out loud. You broke up with Robin?,6,How I Met Your Mother,46,9
34783,Lily,9," I had to. We were growing apart, and we're better off without each other.",6,How I Met Your Mother,74,14
34784,Marshall,9," Okay, Lily, you sound about as convincing as you did the time you ""accidentally"" shredded my Joey Buttafuoco pants.",6,How I Met Your Mother,116,19
34785,Lily,9, No!,6,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
34786,Marshall,9," Get on the phone, call Robin and fix this.",6,How I Met Your Mother,43,9
34787,Lily,9, I can't. The damage is done. Can you just hold me?,6,How I Met Your Mother,51,11
34788,Marshall,9," You know what? No. I don't agree with what you did, and so I refuse to comfort you, despite how adorable you are when you cry.",6,How I Met Your Mother,127,26
34789,Lily,9, Okay.,6,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
34790,Marshall,9," Okay. Maybe just one cuddle, but then that is it.",6,How I Met Your Mother,50,10
34793,Ted,9," Yeah. You know, there's more to New York than Times Square. There's the Village, the Lower East Side, Central Park...",6,How I Met Your Mother,118,20
34795,Ted,9, No.,6,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
34797,Ted,9," Here. You know what? Hold this, okay?",6,How I Met Your Mother,38,7
34799,Barney,9," Seriously, dude, he has got to go. You need to be like, ""You are the weakest link. Goodbye."" Punchy, the tribe has spoken. Please pack up your knives and go. Your work of art didn't work for us. Your time's up. I have to ask you to leave the mansion. You must leave the chateau. Your tour ends here. You've been chopped.",6,How I Met Your Mother,321,62
34800,Ted,9," Okay, yeah. I know.",6,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
34801,Barney,9," You've been evicted from the Big Brother house. Your dessert just didn't measure up. Sashay away. Give me your jacket and leave Hell's Kitchen. I'm sorry, you did not get a rose. You have been eliminated from the race. You are no longer in the running to be America's Next Top Model. You're fired. Auf Wiedersehen.",6,How I Met Your Mother,315,56
34803,Ted,9, That's your scrotum.,6,How I Met Your Mother,21,3
34805,Ted,9," Yeah, he's gotta go.",6,How I Met Your Mother,21,4
34807,Lily,9, What are we doing in Madison Square Garden?,6,How I Met Your Mother,44,8
34808,Marshall,9," Okay, you refused to talk to Robin. So I thought that you might like to talk to... the organist for the New York Rangers. Jessica Glitter?!",6,How I Met Your Mother,140,26
34809,Lily,9, How did you find Glitter?,6,How I Met Your Mother,26,5
34810,Marshall,9," Simple, really. I used my powers of deduction. You see, I knew Glitter used to be a keytarist, which is basically a piano, so I just made a list of all the keyboard-based occupations and then I cross-matched them...",6,How I Met Your Mother,216,39
34812,Marshall,9," Yo, Glitter... Be cool.",6,How I Met Your Mother,24,4
34814,Lily,9, More like ex-best friends. Just like you.,6,How I Met Your Mother,42,7
34816,Lily,9," Yeah, well, Marshall and I are about to get pregnant, and I know she stopped being friends with you when you had a baby, so...",6,How I Met Your Mother,127,25
34818,Lily,9, What? Why?,6,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
34820,Marshall,9, Charge!,6,How I Met Your Mother,8,1
34821,Lily,9, Wow. You dumped her just because you had a baby? That's cold.,6,How I Met Your Mother,62,12
34823,Lily,9," Oh, God. I gotta go. I gotta go apologize to Robin. I- I need to tell her I love her, and that she'll always be a priority.",6,How I Met Your Mother,124,27
34827,Ted,9," Punchy, it's time to go back.",6,How I Met Your Mother,30,6
34829,Ted,9," Uh, no. Back-Back to Cleveland.",6,How I Met Your Mother,32,5
34831,Ted,9, You worry about me?,6,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
34835,Ted,9, Punchy!,6,How I Met Your Mother,8,1
34837,Ted,9," Yeah. You, too. If you're ever in New York...",6,How I Met Your Mother,46,9
34847,Ted,9," Wow. She sounds pretty great, Punchy.",6,How I Met Your Mother,38,6
34849,Ted,9, Wow! Wow! That's... I'm-I'm really happy for you.,6,How I Met Your Mother,50,8
34851,Ted,9, Of course I will.,6,How I Met Your Mother,18,4
34855,Lily,9," Oh, there you are. Robin, I owe you a huge apology.",6,How I Met Your Mother,52,11
34856,Robin,9," No, okay? Me first. I've been pulling away from you, and I'm sorry. It's just, the last time my best friend had a baby...",6,How I Met Your Mother,122,24
34857,Lily,9, I know. I know all about it. It's not gonna happen with you and me. And I'm sorry I've been going crazy with this baby stuff. I know you hate babies.,6,How I Met Your Mother,150,31
34858,Robin,9," Whoa. Look, I hate most babies. But your baby? I'm gonna love that kid so much. I'm gonna pick it up and everything.",6,How I Met Your Mother,117,23
34860,Marshall,9, I'm so happy you guys made up.,6,How I Met Your Mother,31,7
34861,Ted,9," Me, too.",6,How I Met Your Mother,9,2
34862,Barney,9, Where do I know this song from?,6,How I Met Your Mother,32,7
34863,Robin,9," Oh, my God. It's the beaver song. Okay, which one of you put this on?",6,How I Met Your Mother,70,15
34866,Barney,9, Wow. This is so dirty.,6,How I Met Your Mother,23,5
34867,Marshall,9," Come on, Barney. It's a sweet song about friendship.",6,How I Met Your Mother,53,9
34868,Ted,9," Yeah, dude, come on.",6,How I Met Your Mother,21,4
34870,Robin,9," *Dah, dah-dah, dah-dah, dah...*",6,How I Met Your Mother,32,4
34876,Ted,10," Instead of stuffing, I'm going to fill the turkey with... a slightly smaller turkey. It's called a Turturkeykey!",6,How I Met Your Mother,113,18
34877,Lily,10, A Turturkeykey?,6,How I Met Your Mother,16,2
34878,Robin,10," Yeah, I was there for the ""insertion."" He used shoehorns. I'll be having sides.",6,How I Met Your Mother,80,14
34879,Ted,10," Your loss. All right, it's dead in here. I'm gonna call it a little early.",6,How I Met Your Mother,75,15
34880,Barney,10," What? No! You can't go now. It's the night before Thanksgiving. College chicks are back in town. Their moms just made a snide comment about the weight they gained. They called her a bitch, but deep down, they know she's right. And they're about to walk through that door, where we will be waiting with some light beer and some rock hard approval. Wh-what u-up?",6,How I Met Your Mother,361,65
34881,Marshall,10," Yeah. You don't want to bail early, man. You could become The Blitz.",6,How I Met Your Mother,69,13
34885,Ted,10, Wh... you sure? We got big plans.,6,How I Met Your Mother,34,7
34886,Marshall,10," Yeah. Remember how last week we fired up a sandwich, and we listened to Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon while watching The Wizard of Oz?",6,How I Met Your Mother,140,27
34887,Ted,10," Well, tonight, we're doing the same thing, only with ""Weird Al"" Yankovic's Greatest Hits and Apocalypse Now.",6,How I Met Your Mother,109,17
34888,Marshall,10, We'll see what happens.,6,How I Met Your Mother,24,4
34894,Ted,10, Completely naked!,6,How I Met Your Mother,18,2
34895,Marshall,10, Completely naked!,6,How I Met Your Mother,18,2
34897,Marshall,10, And the movie was awesome.,6,How I Met Your Mother,27,5
34899,Ted,10," At the exact moment Brando first appeared, ""Weird Al"" launched right into ""Eat It.""",6,How I Met Your Mother,84,14
34907,Ted,10, Free beer for everyone!,6,How I Met Your Mother,24,4
34908,Marshall,10, Free beer for everyone!,6,How I Met Your Mother,24,4
34911,Marshall,10," You know what? Ted, go ahead-- leave early to do something lame. Just don't blame us if you become... The Blitz.",6,How I Met Your Mother,113,21
34912,Ted,10," All right, first of all... there's nothing lame about brining a Turturkeykey, copyright pending. And secondly, I don't believe ""The Curse of The Blitz"" is real. ",6,How I Met Your Mother,162,26
34916,Ted,10, What the hell happened here?,6,How I Met Your Mother,29,5
34917,Robin,10," Hey! Morning, Blitz!",6,How I Met Your Mother,21,3
34918,Ted,10," Aw, man! No, no! Let's get one thing straight, okay? I am not The Blitz.",6,How I Met Your Mother,73,15
34920,Ted,10," Please stop. Okay, fine.",6,How I Met Your Mother,25,4
34921,Barney,10,...To me.,6,How I Met Your Mother,9,2
34922,Lily,10, The Gentleman!,6,How I Met Your Mother,15,2
34924,Ted,10," Wait! Wait! Wait! What's that? What's ""The Gentleman""?",6,How I Met Your Mother,55,8
34925,Lily,10," Oh, you had to be there, Blitz. Yes.",6,How I Met Your Mother,37,8
34926,Ted,10, I'm not The Blitz!  Zoey?,6,How I Met Your Mother,26,5
34933,Ted,10," How could you, my best friends in the world, hang out with my mortal enemy, then let her sleep in the tub where I clean myself?!",6,How I Met Your Mother,129,26
34934,Lily,10," Sorry, Ted. We can explain. After you Blitzed out last night...",6,How I Met Your Mother,64,11
34935,Ted,10,I'm not The Blitz!,6,How I Met Your Mother,18,4
34937,Lily,10," Oh, my God... That's Zoey! That's Ted's enemy. Which means she's our enemy. Let's take this bitch down.",6,How I Met Your Mother,104,18
34939,Lily,10, Huh? Huh? Who's got your back? Now let's have dinner!,6,How I Met Your Mother,54,10
34940,Ted,10," Finish the story, Red.",6,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
34941,Lily,10," Okay, well, we all started brainstorming ways to mess with her. There were a lot of different ideas kicking around.",6,How I Met Your Mother,116,20
34943,Barney,10," And then I'm just going to leave her there... buck-naked, covered in candle wax, tied to the bed.",6,How I Met Your Mother,98,18
34944,Marshall,10," Barney, I know that Ted doesn't like that girl, but that's a little extreme.",6,How I Met Your Mother,77,14

34973,Marshall,10, Best idea ever!,6,How I Met Your Mother,16,3
34975,Marshall,10," Worst idea ever! My junk ended up in some stranger's pocket. If there phone was on vibrate, I basically dry-humped them.",6,How I Met Your Mother,121,21
34982,Ted,10," Wait. Blitz was there, too?",6,How I Met Your Mother,28,5

34993,Ted,10," What? No! N- n-n-n-no! N-n-no! I'm not The Blitz! The only thing I missed last night was my best friends stabbing me in the back by hanging out with my worst enemy. Guys! I hate Zoey! That means you're supposed to hate her, too! Th-that's your rule, Lily!",6,How I Met Your Mother,256,48
34994,Lily,10, I tried.,6,How I Met Your Mother,9,2
34995,Ted,10," Tried?! Lily, do you have any idea how many people I've blindly hated for you? I hated Rení©e Zellweger with a burning passion for eight years, only to discover you meant Reese Witherspoon!",6,How I Met Your Mother,190,33
34996,Lily,10," Hey, I will hate her until I get my money back for You, Me and Dupree!",6,How I Met Your Mother,71,16

35010,Lily,10," But if it helps, I reached 4G.",6,How I Met Your Mother,31,7
35011,Ted,10, It doesn't help. 4G? No. What-What are we supposed to do now?,6,How I Met Your Mother,62,12
35016,Ted,10," Barney, I don't know if the oven is deep enough. Plus, it's a display made of cardboard.",6,How I Met Your Mother,89,17
35017,Barney,10, Huh. I should probably disconnect the gas.,6,How I Met Your Mother,43,7
35019,Marshall,10," Hey, just so you guys know, there was a tiny explosion at the sewage treatment plant across the street from our apartment, but I'm sure it's fine by now.",6,How I Met Your Mother,154,29

35036,Lily,10, Come on. Give her a chance.,6,How I Met Your Mother,28,6

35069,Barney,10, Thanks. You're the only one who's nice to me about this.,6,How I Met Your Mother,57,11

35088,Ted,10, Who canceled? Your coven?,6,How I Met Your Mother,26,4
35092,Ted,10, Are you happy? You're ruining Thanksgiving.,6,How I Met Your Mother,44,6
35095,Ted,10," Oh... I'm sorry, Lily. I'm just never going to like that woman.",6,How I Met Your Mother,64,12

35113,Robin,10, What does that have to do with anything?,6,How I Met Your Mother,41,8
35114,Barney,10, Nothing! I just forgot to brag about it before!,6,How I Met Your Mother,48,9

35190,Robin,11, Okay.,6,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
35192,Marshall,11," Yeah. I snapped this photo of him last time he dropped off Zoey.Observe. The bottom half of his face... is smiling. He seems happy. Seems like a nice guy.  But the top half of his face...wants to murder you! Cheerful. Wants to murder you. No. Cheerful. Wants to murder you. Now, hold on. Let me ask him a question. Captain, what do you think of ice cream? Oh, he loves it!",6,How I Met Your Mother,373,71

35198,Marshall,11, He hates that he loves them.,6,How I Met Your Mother,29,6
35200,Ted,11," Great. Okay. Hey, guys, Zoey just told me about this great Frank Lloyd Wright retrospective tonight. Who's in?",6,How I Met Your Mother,111,18
35201,Lily,11," Sorry, I'm, uh, I... I- I don't know, washing my hair.",6,How I Met Your Mother,55,11

35203,Robin,11, Holding the towel.,6,How I Met Your Mother,19,3
35204,Barney,11, And I'll be home trying to get over the fact that no one invited meto the big hair washing party.,6,How I Met Your Mother,98,20
35205,Ted,11," All right, fine. Guess it'll just be me and Zoey.",6,How I Met Your Mother,50,10
35206,Lily,11," Oh, wait. Just the two of you? Tread lightly, Mosby. Any time a single guy hangs out with a married woman, there are rules that must be followed. Rule number one...",6,How I Met Your Mother,165,31
35207,Barney,11, Don't use the husband's condoms. That's just rude.,6,How I Met Your Mother,51,8

35213,Barney,11, Lubricant is public property. ,6,How I Met Your Mother,31,4
35214,Marshall,11, Please.,6,How I Met Your Mother,8,1
35215,Lily,11, No lying to the spouse about anything you do.,6,How I Met Your Mother,46,9
35216,Ted,11," Why would anyone lie? Look, Zoey and I are just friends. If there was anything more than that, I wouldn't hang out with her.",6,How I Met Your Mother,125,24
35217,Marshall,11," Lily's right, Ted. Once you're married, it's very hard to be friends with a single person of the opposite s*x.",6,How I Met Your Mother,111,20
35218,Robin,11," Yeah. Unless you're old friends, which is why I can hang out with Marshall whenever I want. Right, Marsh Madness?",6,How I Met Your Mother,114,20

35223,Lily,11, Oh! Sweet. No candles.,6,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
35224,Barney,11," Lily, I guess that leaves just you and me. Want to hang?",6,How I Met Your Mother,57,12
35226,Lily,11, Nah.,6,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
35228,Lily,11, You're a big... stupid octopus head!,6,How I Met Your Mother,37,6
35231,Ted,11," Well, Lily, you were right. Something weird happened with Zoey last night.",6,How I Met Your Mother,75,12
35236,Ted,11, Friends. Plural. Like-Like there was more than one of me.,6,How I Met Your Mother,58,10
35237,Lily,11," Ew! Ew! She lied to her husband? Uh-oh. So, what did you do?",6,How I Met Your Mother,61,13
35239,Ted,11," Uh, Zoey, um, did you just say you were out with friends?",6,How I Met Your Mother,58,12
35241,Ted,11, It's totally okay.,6,How I Met Your Mother,19,3
35243,Lily,11," It's not okay! I didn't really think it was okay! Pur-leez! You lie to your husband all the time. ""Uh, uh, that shirt looks great on you""""I love your mom""""I never fantasize about Barney when we're doing it"""" Sound familiar, Pinocchio?",6,How I Met Your Mother,235,41
35244,Marshall,11, What's wrong with this shirt?,6,How I Met Your Mother,30,5
35245,Ted,11," Lily, ruling. Do I have to stop hanging out with Zoey?",6,How I Met Your Mother,55,11
35246,Lily,11," No, you just need to spend time with her and The Captain together. If you're friends with the both of them, then there's not a problem.",6,How I Met Your Mother,136,26
35247,Ted,11," Actually, I do have a standing invitation from The Captain to go for a ride with them on his boat.",6,How I Met Your Mother,99,20
35248,Lily,11," Great. So go make nice with Captain Creepy, and problem solved.",6,How I Met Your Mother,64,11
35250,Robin,11, December chill... so great.,6,How I Met Your Mother,28,4
35251,Marshall,11, Totally.,6,How I Met Your Mother,9,1

35259,Robin,11," Man, this is awkward.",6,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
35260,Marshall,11," She's giving me nothing! He's just staring at me! She's just staring at me! It's making me nervous. Great, now my left eye is twitching.",6,How I Met Your Mother,137,25
35261,Robin,11," Marshall, it's cool. She doesn't see it. What the hell's going on with his eye? Am I supposed to not talk about that? Great, now my right eye is doing it.",6,How I Met Your Mother,155,31
35263,Marshall,11, Lots of drinks.,6,How I Met Your Mother,16,3
35264,Robin,11," Oh, so many drinks.",6,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
35268,Lily,11, Barney.,6,How I Met Your Mother,8,1
35269,Barney,11," Save it, Lily. I am still mad at you for... something, and for that other thing.",6,How I Met Your Mother,81,16
35270,Lily,11," Look, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings. But let's be honest. You've been super sensitive lately.",6,How I Met Your Mother,95,16
35272,Lily,11, Watch out!,6,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
35274,Lily,11, Watch out!,6,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
35275,Barney,11," Oh! Wow. Thanks, Lily. You saved me. You saved us. Look, I know you didn't mean whatever it was you said that made me so mad.",6,How I Met Your Mother,126,26
35276,Lily,11, I think I probably didn't.,6,How I Met Your Mother,27,5
35278,Lily,11, Wait. I still can't resist getting one last shot in.,6,How I Met Your Mother,53,10
35281,Ted,11," Hi, Captain. The Captain. Captain.",6,How I Met Your Mother,35,5
35283,Ted,11," Ah, you, too. Uh, where's Zoey?",6,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
35285,Ted,11," Or we could stay on dry land, hang out with some... witnesses.",6,How I Met Your Mother,63,12
35289,Robin,11," You know, I had this really boring poetry class in college.",6,How I Met Your Mother,60,11
35290,Marshall,11, You were just thinking that this dinner is really boring. That's what made you think of your boring class in college.,6,How I Met Your Mother,118,21
35291,Robin,11," What?! What? No! No! No, no, no. Marshall, no. No. I... I just saw that board of specials, and I thought, you know what sucks? Being bored. Which I am not. So that clears that... right up.",6,How I Met Your Mother,189,37
35292,Marshall,11," Robin, I'm an attorney.",6,How I Met Your Mother,24,4
35293,Robin,11, Fine. This night's a little awkward.,6,How I Met Your Mother,37,6
35294,Marshall,11, I guess it's 'cause we never hang out alone together.,6,How I Met Your Mother,54,10
35295,Robin,11, Why is that?,6,How I Met Your Mother,13,3
35296,Marshall,11, It's 'cause of The Mermaid Theory.,6,How I Met Your Mother,35,6
35298,Marshall,11," Two years ago, I had just hired a new assistant at GNB.",6,How I Met Your Mother,56,12
35299,Barney,11," So, who's the eye broccoli?",6,How I Met Your Mother,28,5
35300,Marshall,11," Okay, that's Iris, my new assistant. And yes, she's a little plain, but I'm married, so that's good.",6,How I Met Your Mother,101,18
35301,Barney,11," Mark my words, Marshall. Someday you will find Iris so excruciatingly attractive, you won't be able to look her directly in the boobs.",6,How I Met Your Mother,135,23
35302,Marshall,11, I don't think that's gonna be a problem.,6,How I Met Your Mother,41,8
35303,Barney,11," Marshall, do you know how the myth of mermaids came to be?",6,How I Met Your Mother,59,12
35304,Marshall,11, I'm sorry. Myth?,6,How I Met Your Mother,17,3
35305,Barney,11," It was 300 years ago. Sailors stuck at sea would get desperate for female companionship. It got so bad that, eventually, the manatees out in the water started to look like... beautiful women. Mermaids. Let's go get some tail! Oh. You see, every woman, no matter how initially repugnant, has a mermaid clock... the time it takes for you to realize you want to bone her. Sure, today you see Iris as a manatee. But she ain't gonna stay that way. Marshall, your secretary's mermaid clock starts right now.",6,How I Met Your Mother,502,89
35306,Marshall,11," And it took one year, three months, and 16 days, but eventually...",6,How I Met Your Mother,67,12
35307,Barney,11, D'oh! Told you. The Mermaid Theory. It's a thing. You owe me 500 bucks.,6,How I Met Your Mother,72,14
35308,Marshall,11, Did we bet on this?,6,How I Met Your Mother,20,5
35309,Barney,11, Let's say yes.,6,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
35311,Robin,11, And that's why we never hang out alone? Yes.,6,How I Met Your Mother,45,9
35312,Marshall,11," As Lily's best friend, you are the last person on the planet o's allowed to turn into a mermaid.",6,How I Met Your Mother,97,19
35313,Robin,11," Wait, does that mean that I'm a manatee right now?",6,How I Met Your Mother,51,10
35314,Marshall,11, Big-time manatee.,6,How I Met Your Mother,18,2
35315,Robin,11, What were those sailors thinking?,6,How I Met Your Mother,34,5
35316,Marshall,11, Huh. I don't know. Being out at sea can do crazy things to a man.,6,How I Met Your Mother,66,15
35321,Ted,11," He's gonna kill me. Okay, calm down, Teddy. He's not jealous. He hasn't even mentioned Zoey.",6,How I Met Your Mother,93,16
35324,Lily,11," Seriously? I step away for five seconds, and you eat all my onion rings? No surprise there.",6,How I Met Your Mother,92,17
35325,Barney,11," What's that supposed to mean? Are you calling me fat? If there is one thing you never do, it is call a woman fat right to her face!",6,How I Met Your Mother,132,28
35328,Lily,11, Want to hang?,6,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
35329,Barney,11, Nah. Watch out!,6,How I Met Your Mother,16,3
35330,Lily,11," Wow... thanks, Barney. You saved me. You saved us.",6,How I Met Your Mother,51,9
35332,Lily,11," If there's one thing you never do, it's call a woman fat right to her face!",6,How I Met Your Mother,76,16
35335,Barney,11," Oh, Lily, I'm sorry. Hey, you want to see a magic trick?",6,How I Met Your Mother,57,12
35336,Lily,11, You're a jerk.,6,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
35340,Ted,11," Just gonna make a quick call. Hey, silly question. What are our exact nautical coordinates?",6,How I Met Your Mother,92,15
35342,Ted,11, Head?,6,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
35344,Ted,11," Well, I got a big morning, so... Dry cleaners, bank, you know, so...",6,How I Met Your Mother,69,13
35346,Ted,11,,6,How I Met Your Mother,0,0
35352,Robin,11," you're afraid that if you spend too much time alone with me, I'll turn into a mermaid?",6,How I Met Your Mother,87,17
35353,Marshall,11," Yes. I mean, sure, right now, you're bald and leathery ancovered in a thick layer of blubber...",6,How I Met Your Mother,96,17
35354,Robin,11, Am I blushing or...?,6,How I Met Your Mother,21,4
35355,Marshall,11,"...but at some point, my stupid male brain will transform you into a foxy fish-babe singin' ""Part of Your World"" to my pants.",6,How I Met Your Mother,125,23
35356,Robin,11," Okay, even if that happens, is there any way to un-mermaid me?",6,How I Met Your Mother,63,12
35357,Marshall,11, I asked Barney the same thing.,6,How I Met Your Mother,31,6
35359,Barney,11," Once mermaid-ified, there's only one way a woman can go back to being unattractive again, but it's pretty gruesome.",6,How I Met Your Mother,116,19
35360,Marshall,11, Death?,6,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
35361,Barney,11," Worse. Pregnancy. If a baby's on board that train, it is headed straight back to Manatee City... where the grass ain't green and the girls ain't pretty.",6,How I Met Your Mother,153,27
35363,Robin,11, Pregnancy?,6,How I Met Your Mother,11,1
35364,Marshall,11," Mm-hmm. Once a mermaid gets pregnant, she becomes a manatee again. Never thought I'd say that sentence.",6,How I Met Your Mother,104,17
35366,Barney,11," Well, Lily, I guess it's just you and me. You wanna hang?",6,How I Met Your Mother,58,12
35368,Barney,11," High heels chafe my shoulders. But you don't have to worry about that anymore. Ever since you got pregnant, you're just a big fat manatee.",6,How I Met Your Mother,139,25
35369,Lily,11," Well, you're a big... stupid octopus face!",6,How I Met Your Mother,43,7
35371,Lily,11," Wow. Thanks, Barney. You saved me. You saved us. If there's one thing you never do, it's call a woman ""fat"" right to her face!",6,How I Met Your Mother,127,25
35372,Barney,11," I'm sorry, Lily. Hey, you want to see a magic trick?",6,How I Met Your Mother,53,11
35373,Lily,11, Oh... You're a jerk.,6,How I Met Your Mother,21,4
35375,Barney,11," Hey. Hey, wait. Come on. I was kid... Wait, wait, wait! There's another addendum to The Mermaid Theory. A pregnant woman who's become a manatee can become a mermaid again through one simple act.",6,How I Met Your Mother,195,34
35376,Lily,11,What's that?,6,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
35377,Barney,11, Breast-feeding. Hot.,6,How I Met Your Mother,21,2
35378,Lily,11, Really?,6,How I Met Your Mother,8,1
35379,Barney,11, Really. When those things swell up to three times their normal size... so do I.,6,How I Met Your Mother,80,15
35380,Lily,11, That's so sweet!,6,How I Met Your Mother,17,3
35384,Ted,11," Okay, now we're even!",6,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
35388,Ted,11, Well... ish.,6,How I Met Your Mother,13,2
35390,Ted,11, See? It's stuff like that. Why-why do you talk that way?,6,How I Met Your Mother,57,11
35392,Ted,11, We can. We can be buddies. Just not on a boat.,6,How I Met Your Mother,47,11
35397,Marshall,11," Yeah, me, too.",6,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
35400,Marshall,11," No... No, no! No! No, don't turn!",6,How I Met Your Mother,34,7
35401,Robin,11," Uh-oh. I don't feel so good.  Oh, my God! Oh, my God, I am, I am so sorry! Oh! You must think I'm totally disgusting.",6,How I Met Your Mother,118,25
35402,Marshall,11, I really do.,6,How I Met Your Mother,13,3
35406,Ted,11, Hey. You feeling better?,6,How I Met Your Mother,25,4
35408,Ted,11, You weren't?,6,How I Met Your Mother,13,2
35410,Ted,11," I get it. And you were right. He's a nice guy. I mean, he can be a little scary.",6,How I Met Your Mother,81,19
35412,Ted,11," Yeah, he's a creepy dude. But I like him. And I just want to make sure you and I hanging out doesn't, you know, cross any lines.",6,How I Met Your Mother,129,27
35414,Ted,11," I mean, if either one of us had even the slightest hint of feelings for the other, we shouldn't hang out. You don't, do you?",6,How I Met Your Mother,125,25
35416,Ted,11, No.,6,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
35423,Marshall,12, This is taking forever. Are you sure you did it right?,6,How I Met Your Mother,55,11
35424,Lily,12, Is there a wrong way to pee on a stick?,6,How I Met Your Mother,40,10
35425,Marshall,12," Hey, can I ask you a question that's plagued me for years? Can girls aim?",6,How I Met Your Mother,74,15
35426,Lily,12," Um, can boys aim? 'Cause it seems to me like I'm taking a mop to that bathroom floor every two days.",6,How I Met Your Mother,101,21
35427,Marshall,12," Okay, you're the one who put the Far Side calendar up over the toilet. You know I laugh with my whole body.",6,How I Met Your Mother,108,22
35428,Lily,12, It's been two minutes.,6,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
35431,Lily,12, It's positive.,6,How I Met Your Mother,15,2

35438,Robin,12, To Lily and Marshall.,6,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
35439,Marshall,12," Well, thank you. I mean, we've never been happier. Can't imagine anything bringing me down right now.",6,How I Met Your Mother,102,17
35442,Marshall,12," Well, that did it.",6,How I Met Your Mother,19,4
35445,Marshall,12, Are you sure you did it right?,6,How I Met Your Mother,31,7
35447,Ted,12," Hey, Punchy, I've given this some serious thought. I think I know how we can crush these floral arrangements.",6,How I Met Your Mother,110,19
35449,Ted,12," Peonies, lavender blossoms with a halo of baby's breath for an ambiance of springtime rejuvenation.",6,How I Met Your Mother,100,15
35451,Ted,12, It's gonna be a magical day.  I know what you're thinking. I wish I was a dude.,6,How I Met Your Mother,80,17
35452,Robin,12, I do wish you were a dude.,6,How I Met Your Mother,27,7
35453,Ted,12," Because if I was a dude, I could have Ted Mosby as my best man.",6,How I Met Your Mother,64,15
35454,Robin,12," No, and here's why.,Ted, the best man's job is not to crush the floral arrangements. It's to get the groom down the aisle, because, no matter who he is, he will freak out. And I just don't think you have what it takes to get that get that soldier to pick up his rifle and charge up the hill.",6,How I Met Your Mother,292,59

35456,Robin,12, And how did that go again? Oh for one.,6,How I Met Your Mother,39,9
35457,Ted,12," Oh, come on. That wasn't my fault. And need I remind you, I gave a beautiful toast.",6,How I Met Your Mother,84,17
35458,Robin,12," Ted.  Oh, do you take one to be your lawfully wedded wife? Oh, God, I'm freaking out. Why did I chose Ted to be my best man?",6,How I Met Your Mother,125,27
35459,Ted,12," Uh, yeah. It's hard to take criticism from someone who just recorded seven episodes of Million Dollar Heads or Tails.",6,How I Met Your Mother,118,20
35463,Ted,12, Why this sudden obsession with Heads or Tails?,6,How I Met Your Mother,47,8
35464,Robin,12," Well, it turns out that Heads or Tails has a job opening.",6,How I Met Your Mother,58,12

35580,Barney,12,"...Zero...  Woops. Hold on a second. Wait. They're not doing something meaningful with their lives. Well, this changes everything. Oh, no, I've already written four zeroes. Thank you, decimal point. One hundred dollars.",6,How I Met Your Mother,219,33
35583,Barney,12," Diamond suited up. Hey, Ted, can you spot me for the movie? I don't like to carry a lot of cash on me.",6,How I Met Your Mother,103,23
35584,Ted,12, What happened to giving the money away?,6,How I Met Your Mother,40,7
35585,Barney,12," Yeah, that was back when Lily was pregnant. Now she's not. Ergo, a suit is born.  Dude, what's up with the gingerbread house? You look ridiculous!",6,How I Met Your Mother,147,26
35586,Ted,12, It's a Christmas-themed movie snack!,6,How I Met Your Mother,37,5

35588,Ted,12, Where the hell are Marshall and Lily?,6,How I Met Your Mother,38,7
35591,Lily,12, I'm pregnant.,6,How I Met Your Mother,14,2

35594,Marshall,12," This is great. I'm happy. I'm so happy, my heart's pounding. And I'm sweating. And I can't breathe. This is what happiness feels like, right? Oh, crap.

35602,Marshall,12, I'm committed. I'm riding this wave straight to hell.,6,How I Met Your Mother,54,9
35603,Lily,12," Let's leave, then the waving will make sense.",6,How I Met Your Mother,46,8
35606,Marshall,12," Lily, we have to relax. There's no need to panic. True, there's a lot to do, but we've got nine months to prepare. So I say that we just make a list of everything that needs to get done before the baby arrives and do everything on that list tonight!",6,How I Met Your Mother,250,50

35625,Lily,12," Marshall, I don't like this.",6,How I Met Your Mother,29,5

35645,Barney,12, Oh. Our movie snack.,6,How I Met Your Mother,21,4
35646,Ted,12," Are you kidding me?! All you ever talk about is having kids! And now you have one little freak-out and you want to get a dog instead?! No. Unacceptable! You're gonna turn around, you're gonna go home, get naked, lie together as man and wife until Lily is great with child. Right now! I'm serious! Go, go, go!",6,How I Met Your Mother,309,58
35649,Ted,12," And you! Ooh. Barney, you look real stupid in that suit. You're gonna go get your money back and give it to charity. And I don't mean that stripper you keep e-mailing us about, even though we beg you to take us off that list.",6,How I Met Your Mother,226,45

35691,Ted,12, Scherbatsky... I'm gonna crush it.,6,How I Met Your Mother,35,5
35693,Barney,12," Hi, there. We've had a lot of fun tonight, but on a more serious note, this is the time of year when we remember the importance of giving. And there's no greater gift than the gift of booty. So, this holiday season, why not bang someone in need? I'm Barney Stinson, and that's... One to grow on.",6,How I Met Your Mother,296,57

35704,Lily,13," Seriously, Doc, why isn't this happening?",6,How I Met Your Mother,42,6
35707,Marshall,13," Dr. John Stangel? I don't know, baby, do we really need a specialist?",6,How I Met Your Mother,70,13
35708,Lily,13," Well, what's your plan, Marshall, just have unprotected s*x day after day after day in every position imaginable until...? Wait, it sounded worse in my head.",6,How I Met Your Mother,158,26
35709,Barney,13," Guys, we've got a problem. This is the application for the regional doubles laser tag tournament in Poughkeepsie. Problem is, only one of you can be my partner. So it looks like we've got a bake-off. You may now present your arguments.",6,How I Met Your Mother,236,42

35736,Lily,13," No, we've made a binding covenant with the universe. We said we weren't going to try to have kids until we saw Barney's doppelganger. Oh, this is bad news. This is like a black cat walked through my uterus. Okay, that's it. I am going back to Dr. Stangel and getting thoroughly checked out.",6,How I Met Your Mother,291,54
35737,Barney,13, Or... or cost-saving alternative,6,How I Met Your Mother,33,4
35739,Lily,13, I still kind of think it's Barney.,6,How I Met Your Mother,35,7
35740,Marshall,13, There's no way it's Barney.,6,How I Met Your Mother,28,5
35742,Marshall,13," It's Barney. Wow. Really, dude, bravo. You almost got a peek. But seriously, what second-rate community theater did you get...?",6,How I Met Your Mother,128,20

35822,Ted,13," Robin, a word of advice",6,How I Met Your Mother,24,5
35823,Barney,13," Exactly! Or when your... I don't know... friend invites you to a laser tag tournament, you don't fight it. You just strap on the vinyl holster and race into that abandoned JCPenney guns a-blazin'. I'm just agreeing with Ted.",6,How I Met Your Mother,225,39
35825,Marshall,13," Oh, it's my dad.",6,How I Met Your Mother,17,4

36173,Lily,14," Hey, so it's a pocket dial. You have so many great memories with your dad. Who cares about the last one?",6,How I Met Your Mother,105,21
36174,Barney,14, She's right. Your dad was hilarious.,6,How I Met Your Mother,37,6
36175,Marshall,14," You guys don't get it, okay? None of you do. My dad was my hero. And he was my teacher. And he was my best friend. He always came through for me. And now he's just gone. And what am I left with?  Thanks a lot, God! Thank you! You took my father, the greatest man that I have ever known, and you ripped him off this Earth, way too young! And he'll never get to meet our kids, Lily.  But we got this voice mail. Thank you so much for the voice mail! It's a great comfort! 'Cause whenever I'm starting to feel lonely or sad, or-- or you know what, or maybe a little bit cheated, at least I got the sound of his pocket to console me. How is this fair? You know, like, an entire human life and it just ends for no reason, and... and what are we left with?",6,How I Met Your Mother,751,155
36178,Lily,14, Looks like your dad came through one last time.,6,How I Met Your Mother,48,9

36239,Ted,15, Yes. And we miss you. But the cousin thing mostly. Let's get that going.,6,How I Met Your Mother,73,14
36250,Ted,15," Hi, Honey, I'm Ted.",6,How I Met Your Mother,20,4

36317,Lily,15, Are you sure it's love?,6,How I Met Your Mother,24,5

36327,Ted,15, Then what am I supposed to do?,6,How I Met Your Mother,31,7
36328,Robin,15," Okay, just shut it down. Okay, just ignore your feelings. If-If she asks you for ketchup, tell her to get it her own damn self. Look, I like Zoey.

36521,Ted,16," Hey, I'm trying. I keep suggesting these big, romantic dates, and she keeps putting on the brakes. Like tonight, she wants me to just come over and bake cookies.",6,How I Met Your Mother,162,29
36522,Robin,16,  Oh. Translation,6,How I Met Your Mother,17,2
36523,Barney,16,  Total booty-call.,6,How I Met Your Mother,19,2
36524,Lily,16," Private Booty, reporting for duty.",6,How I Met Your Mother,35,5
36525,Ted,16, That's crazy. She-She wants to bake.,6,How I Met Your Mother,37,6
36526,Robin,16,  Guys booty-call girls after 2,6,How I Met Your Mother,31,5
36527,Lily,16," It's called class, Ted.",6,How I Met Your Mother,24,4
36528,Ted,16," Wait. That... You think that's what she means by ""baking cookies""?",6,How I Met Your Mother,67,11
36529,Lily,16," Are you kidding? You're in the kitchen, it's getting hot, you start licking stuff off each others' fingers. Before you know it, she's bent over the marble island, and you're spanking her with a rubber spatula. And she's screaming, ""Stop, Marshall, stop,"" but that's just code for ""harder!""",6,How I Met Your Mother,290,48
36530,Ted,16," Marshall's been in Minnesota a while, huh?",6,How I Met Your Mother,43,7
36531,Lily,16, So long! And now he's staying even longer. His mom has been having a really hard time since the funeral. He's waiting on her hand and foot. But... it's Valentine's Day. It's not going to be the same without the two of us watching Predator together.,6,How I Met Your Mother,249,46
36534,Marshall,16," You know, I saw this in the theater, like, five times, but I never got to see it with the right girl.",6,How I Met Your Mother,102,22
36535,Lily,16, I'm so glad none of those girls were right for you.,6,How I Met Your Mother,52,11
36536,Marshall,16, What girls?,6,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
36540,Barney,16,"  Wow, you sound really lonely.",6,How I Met Your Mother,31,5
36541,Lily,16," I am. Earlier today, I burst into tears...",6,How I Met Your Mother,43,8
36542,Barney,16,"  Shh. Daddy's talking now. Loneliness. The looming specter of Valentine's Day fast approaching. The two key ingredients to my favorite day of the year, February 13",6,How I Met Your Mother,164,26
36543,Robin,16,  That's not a thing.,6,How I Met Your Mother,21,4
36544,Barney,16,"  It's a thing. Much like Valentine's Day itself, Desperation Day dates back thousands of years. Weddings were forbidden under ancient Roman law, so Saint Valentine performed them in secret, under threat of death.",6,How I Met Your Mother,213,33
36545,Ted,16, That's actually true.,6,How I Met Your Mother,22,3
36546,Barney,16,"  Wait, there's more.",6,How I Met Your Mother,21,3
36547,Ted,16, This won't be.,6,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
36549,Barney,16,"  And right by Saint Valentine's side was his best bro, Saint Desperatius, there to pick off insecure bridesmaids.",6,How I Met Your Mother,114,18
36555,Barney,16,"  Every woman wants a date on Valentine's Day. That neediness reaches its climax... what up... on February 13. A magical night when a ten has the self-esteem of a four and the depraved enthusiasm of a two. Now, there's only one thing you can't do.",6,How I Met Your Mother,247,45
36556,Robin,16,"  Please say ""widows.""",6,How I Met Your Mother,22,3
36557,Barney,16,"  Wherever you are, or whoever you're under, you must get home alone by 11",6,How I Met Your Mother,74,14
36558,Robin,16,"  Barney, Desperation Day assumes that all single women freak out about Valentine's Day. Which we do not. Case in point, I will be spending February 13 with some lovely single ladies from work...",6,How I Met Your Mother,195,33
36559,Barney,16,  Trolls.,6,How I Met Your Mother,9,1
36560,Robin,16, ...who could care less about Valentine's Day.,6,How I Met Your Mother,46,7
36561,Barney,16,  Lying trolls.,6,How I Met Your Mother,15,2
36562,Robin,16,"  And we will be celebrating the fact that we don't have to spend it with some dippy guy carting around roses and stuffed toys all night. Oh, no offense, Ted.",6,How I Met Your Mother,158,30
36563,Ted,16, And none was taken until just then.,6,How I Met Your Mother,36,7
36565,Lily,16, I decided to go to Minnesota to see Marshall. He shouldn't have to help his mom through this rough time all by himself.,6,How I Met Your Mother,120,23
36566,Barney,16," You losing your mind, being alone in your apartment?",6,How I Met Your Mother,53,9
36567,Lily,16, I'm getting weird!,6,How I Met Your Mother,19,3
36569,Lily,16," See, it started off with me throwing Marshall's jersey on my body pillow. And, well, things kind of spiraled from there. I'm sorry I yelled like that before.",6,How I Met Your Mother,158,28
36571,Lily,16," I call him ""Marshpillow."" And he calls me... nothing because he's a pillow.",6,How I Met Your Mother,76,13
36573,Robin,16,"  Hey. How was ""baking cookies"" last night?",6,How I Met Your Mother,43,7
36579,Lily,16, You brought an overnight bag?,6,How I Met Your Mother,30,5
36580,Ted,16, You guys said I was definitely going to spend the night.,6,How I Met Your Mother,57,11
36581,Barney,16,"  We said you were going to have s*x. We didn't say, ""Bring a carry-on.""",6,How I Met Your Mother,72,14
36582,Robin,16,  So how did Zoey react?,6,How I Met Your Mother,24,5
36583,Ted,16, She thought it was presumptuous and asked me to leave. It's-It's not like I brought a ton of stuff.,6,How I Met Your Mother,100,19
36584,Robin,16,  Were there slippers for the morning?,6,How I Met Your Mother,38,6
36585,Ted,16," Not slippers, exactly.",6,How I Met Your Mother,23,3
36587,Ted,16, They're called British morning socks.,6,How I Met Your Mother,38,5
36590,Lily,16," How are you holding up, Judy?",6,How I Met Your Mother,30,6
36592,Marshall,16," Hey, Mom? I hate to be that guy, but I'm pretty sure it was Hot Pocket o'clock, like, ten minutes ago. Lily. What are you doing here?",6,How I Met Your Mother,134,27
36593,Lily,16, I wanted to surprise you.,6,How I Met Your Mother,26,5
36594,Marshall,16," Oh, my gosh. That's so sweet. I'm so glad you're here. Hey, um, before I forget, Mom, did you remember to get more double-A batteries?",6,How I Met Your Mother,135,25
36596,Marshall,16," Oh, great, okay. I don't want my Game Boy to crap out. I'm having the sickest Dr. Mario run of my life. Okay. I'll be right back. I love you, Lily. Okay. You're the best, Mom.",6,How I Met Your Mother,176,36
36598,Lily,16, I thought he was here helping you.,6,How I Met Your Mother,35,7
36600,Lily,16," Uh, I'll talk to him.",6,How I Met Your Mother,22,5
36602,Lily,16," Oh, God.",6,How I Met Your Mother,9,2
36606,Ted,16," Listen, that was a dumb move for me to just assume...",6,How I Met Your Mother,54,11
36608,Ted,16, We totally did.,6,How I Met Your Mother,16,3
36610,Ted,16, They're actually called British morning socks.,6,How I Met Your Mother,47,6
36612,Ted,16, Right. Okay.,6,How I Met Your Mother,13,2
36614,Lily,16," Um, Marshall, your mom asked me to carry this up. She turned her ankle on your Hot Wheels. Is my track okay? It's fine, but, Marshall, I thought you were here taking care of your mom. It seems like she's taking care of you.",6,How I Met Your Mother,224,44
36615,Marshall,16," My mom loves to feel needed. Letting her take care of me is how I'm taking care of her. She's in a dark place, Lily. She needs this. Mom? You forgot my chocolate milk with the swirly straw!",6,How I Met Your Mother,190,38
36618,Lily,16," Marshall, tomorrow's Valentine's. Don't you want to be at home on our couch, cuddling up under a warm blanket, watching the Predator use his heat vision to stalk helpless prey?",6,How I Met Your Mother,177,30
36619,Marshall,16," Well, baby, we could watch Predator here. No, my mom can go rent it for us after she's done digging out the car.",6,How I Met Your Mother,113,23
36620,Lily,16," Marshall, your mom wants you out of here.",6,How I Met Your Mother,42,8
36621,Marshall,16, What?,6,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
36623,Marshall,16," Mom, d-do you want me to leave?",6,How I Met Your Mother,32,7
36625,Lily,16," But, Judy, you said...",6,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
36628,Ted,16," Yeah. You know, there's this new Italian restaurant on 79th that's supposed to be amazing.",6,How I Met Your Mother,91,15
36630,Ted,16," Tomorrow night, my place.",6,How I Met Your Mother,26,4
36634,Ted,16, Isn't that great?,6,How I Met Your Mother,18,3
36635,Robin,16,"  Yeah, if you say so, yeah.",6,How I Met Your Mother,28,6
36636,Ted,16, What do you mean?,6,How I Met Your Mother,18,4
36637,Robin,16,"  Look, she just got out of a marriage, Ted. That's heavy. I'm kind of freaking out, just listening to you. My heart is pounding, I'm hearing this weird clicking noise.",6,How I Met Your Mother,168,30
36638,Ted,16," Well, it's romantic, right? Zoey and I are getting serious on Valentine's Day.",6,How I Met Your Mother,79,13
36639,Robin,16,"  See, that just amps up the pressure even more. Boy, it's a good thing that you're sure.",6,How I Met Your Mother,89,17
36640,Ted,16," Who said I wasn't sure? I'm glad we're in a serious relationship. Right away. And if I screw this up, I'm the devil, because she's going through a divorce. But I'm not going to screw this up. So stop freaking out, Robin. Stop freaking out!",6,How I Met Your Mother,240,45
36643,Ted,16, Hi! I'm here to help Marshall.,6,How I Met Your Mother,31,6
36646,Barney,16,"  God, these girls are so hungry for male attention. It is like being a hunter and having the deer walk up, tie itself to the hood of your car and beg to get mounted.",6,How I Met Your Mother,166,34
36647,Robin,16,"  Barney, this is Bev and Anna, uh, my coworkers and my friends. Bev, Anna, this is Barney, a high-functioning sociopath and my ex.",6,How I Met Your Mother,131,23
36648,Barney,16,"  Enchantí©. That's French for ""What's with the purple?""",6,How I Met Your Mother,56,8
36649,Robin,16,"  Well, tomorrow is Valentine's Day, and everything is pink and red, so Bev very thoughtfully suggested that we wear purple to show how little we care.",6,How I Met Your Mother,151,26
36652,Robin,16,"  And we don't care about some stupid, sexist, corporate holiday.",6,How I Met Your Mother,65,10
36653,Barney,16,"  Please! You might as well be dog-earing a tear-stained bridal magazine while wolfing down the box of chocolates you had delivered to yourself at work from your ""fiancí©"" who no one's ever met.",6,How I Met Your Mother,194,33
36657,Lily,16, Ted... I thought you were going to talk to Marshall about coming back to New York.,6,How I Met Your Mother,83,16
36658,Ted,16," Yeah, but, you know, things move so fast in New York. Why not hang out here until at least after Valentine's Day. Plus, we're helping Marshall's mom. Uh, Mrs. Eriksen, we're running low on SunnyD!",6,How I Met Your Mother,197,35
36662,Barney,16,"  Okay, when your ""fiancí©"" Gerard comes back from fixing cleft palates in Peru, maybe snatch a photo of the two of you together, and then I'll totally believe you.",6,How I Met Your Mother,164,29
36665,Robin,16,"  Hey. Hey, Nora. Uh, Nora, this is Barney. You want to see Anna beat him in an arm wrestle?",6,How I Met Your Mother,92,19

36671,Marshall,16," I can't right now, 'cause my mom needs me.",6,How I Met Your Mother,43,9
36672,Lily,16, While I'm sure it's been really helpful for her to have you here playing Super Mario Kart for 14 hours a day...,6,How I Met Your Mother,112,22
36673,Ted,16, You have Super Mario Kart?!,6,How I Met Your Mother,28,5
36674,Marshall,16," Hell, yeah.",6,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
36675,Lily,16, But your mom doesn't need you. Your life in New York needs you. It needs you really bad.,6,How I Met Your Mother,89,18
36676,Marshall,16," Baby, don't go.",6,How I Met Your Mother,16,3
36677,Lily,16, Please come home soon.,6,How I Met Your Mother,23,4

36685,Barney,16,  Quick question.,6,How I Met Your Mother,17,2
36687,Barney,16,  Why aren't you wearing purple like your friends?,6,How I Met Your Mother,50,8
36689,Barney,16,  Sure.,6,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
36691,Barney,16,"  Oh, my gosh! Me, too! Um, is it getting crowded in here, 'cause I think there are two peas in this pod?",6,How I Met Your Mother,105,22
36693,Barney,16,"  Guilty. This is embarrassing but every year, I buy flowers and a box of chocolates, even if I'm not with someone. Just in case, you know?",6,How I Met Your Mother,139,26
36695,Barney,16,  The worst.,6,How I Met Your Mother,12,2

36702,Ted,16, I know.,6,How I Met Your Mother,8,2
36703,Marshall,16," Um, when I was a kid, we would spend the summers in the Upper Peninsula. And every year, we wouldn't get to the cabin till, like, the middle of the night. And so, it would be pitch black, in the middle of the woods. And I could never see anything in front of the headlights but I always felt so safe 'cause my dad was driving. He was like some sort of superhero who could just see way out into the darkness. Now he's just gone. And it's pitch black. And I can't see where I'm going. I can't see anything.",6,How I Met Your Mother,505,101
36705,Barney,16,"  All right, okay. I was playing you before. But I was really doing you a public service. It's February 13... a day many are now calling Desperation Day. It's kind of a thing. And you walking around, saying you're a gooey romantic? It comes across a bit desperate.",6,How I Met Your Mother,264,48
36707,Barney,16,"  Um, or you could be in the 47th Semi-Annual Laser Tag Tournament in Poughkeepsie.",6,How I Met Your Mother,83,14
36710,Barney,16,  Here's the first thing you need to know about laser tag.,6,How I Met Your Mother,58,11
36712,Marshall,16," Thanks a lot for coming out here, man.",6,How I Met Your Mother,39,8
36713,Ted,16, Yeah.,6,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
36714,Marshall,16," Hey, are-are you sure it's okay with Zoey that you're here for Valentine's Day?",6,How I Met Your Mother,80,14
36715,Ted,16," Well, I mean, technically, she doesn't know yet.",6,How I Met Your Mother,49,8
36716,Marshall,16, What?,6,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
36717,Ted,16," Things with Zoey are moving really fast, and the divorce just makes everything more complicated. I just, I needed to take a step back.",6,How I Met Your Mother,135,24
36718,Marshall,16," You're not taking a step back. You're running away. And hiding out here, hiding out here is not gonna solve anything. You're just holed up in Minnesota because you're too scared to face reality, and it's... We got to go back to New York, tonight.",6,How I Met Your Mother,247,45
36719,Ted,16, We're snowed in. Lily got the last flight.,6,How I Met Your Mother,43,8
36720,Marshall,16," So, we drive. It's time. It's time to get back to real life. It's time to grow up. Yeah Mom! Can you make us some PB and J's for the road?",6,How I Met Your Mother,139,31
36721,Ted,16, Crusts cut off.,6,How I Met Your Mother,16,3

36729,Robin,16,  Well...,6,How I Met Your Mother,9,1
36732,Robin,16,  What?,6,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
36734,Robin,16,"  What...? So that's it? A couple of white Urkels offer you sausages, and you're gone? What about the sisterhood? Solidarity? The color purple?",6,How I Met Your Mother,143,23
36736,Robin,16,  I thought we didn't care about Valentine's Day.,6,How I Met Your Mother,49,8

36743,Robin,16,  Speaking of the power of Valentine's Day...,6,How I Met Your Mother,45,7
36744,Barney,16,  What are you talking about?,6,How I Met Your Mother,29,5
36745,Robin,16,"  Oh, come on. It's-It's past midnight. Desperation Day has come and gone, and you have neither gone nor come. You know why? You like Nora.",6,How I Met Your Mother,139,25
36746,Barney,16,"  No, I don't. She's gross.",6,How I Met Your Mother,27,5
36747,Robin,16,  Oh... You like her. You think she smells like rain.,6,How I Met Your Mother,53,10
36748,Barney,16,  Whatever you say.,6,How I Met Your Mother,19,3
36749,Robin,16,"  Oh, hey, Nora.",6,How I Met Your Mother,16,3
36750,Barney,16,  Nora...,6,How I Met Your Mother,9,1
36755,Ted,16," Well, that was kind of presumptuous.",6,How I Met Your Mother,37,6
36757,Barney,16,"  The ground was shaking like. Robin, where are you? Those Boy Scouts have grown a foot since last year. They're terrifying!",6,How I Met Your Mother,124,21
36758,Robin,16,"  Oh, yeah. Change of plans. Happy Valentine's Day.",6,How I Met Your Mother,51,8

36770,Lily,16, We both knew this would end eventually.,6,How I Met Your Mother,40,7
36773,Ted,17," Yes, I realize it's raining, but, come on, it's 2021. We can make cell phones that project holograms, but a light drizzle shuts down a whole airport?",6,How I Met Your Mother,150,27
36775,Ted,17, Hey... There she is. Wow.,6,How I Met Your Mother,26,5
36777,Ted,17, Wendy the Waitress! I was just saying-- what are you doing here?,6,How I Met Your Mother,65,12
36781,Robin,17," So, Barney, I hear you and Nora had a fun time at laser tag.",6,How I Met Your Mother,61,14
36782,Barney,17, I don't know where you heard that. It was a disaster.,6,How I Met Your Mother,54,11
36783,Robin,17, Not according to her.,6,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
36786,Barney,17, You want to grab a drink right now?,6,How I Met Your Mother,36,8
36788,Barney,17, Absolutely.,6,How I Met Your Mother,12,1
36790,Robin,17, How is that a disaster?,6,How I Met Your Mother,24,5

36793,Barney,17, You want to grab a drink right now?,6,How I Met Your Mother,36,8
36795,Barney,17, Absolutely.,6,How I Met Your Mother,12,1
36797,Barney,17," It's a shame, too. She was a really great laser tag partner. She's tiny, so she's allowed to push kids.",6,How I Met Your Mother,104,20
36798,Robin,17," Please, Cheese. You like this girl.",6,How I Met Your Mother,36,6

36802,Robin,17, You like her. You should call her.,6,How I Met Your Mother,35,7

36805,Barney,17, Totally.,6,How I Met Your Mother,9,1
36809,Ted,17," No, it's a cute story. Once upon a time...",6,How I Met Your Mother,43,9
36811,Ted,17," Zoey was married to this super rich, super creepy guy called The Captain. So when Zoey and I became friends, I was careful not to cross any lines.",6,How I Met Your Mother,147,28
36813,Ted,17," I know, right? But then one day, Zoey and The Captain had a huge fight. He flipped out and demanded a divorce. And she was heartbroken. But after a little soul-searching, she ended up back in my and the rest, as they say, is history.",6,How I Met Your Mother,234,45
36816,Ted,17, Oh. A little cold.,6,How I Met Your Mother,19,4
36819,Ted,17," Oh. Yeah, I don't want to see The Captain. I mean this in a super manly way. That guy scares the panties off me.",6,How I Met Your Mother,113,24
36821,Ted,17," If it's really important to you, I will pick it up tomorrow.",6,How I Met Your Mother,61,12
36822,Marshall,17," All right, guys, I have to go. I have a big meaningless stack of paperwork that I have to get off my desk to make room for tomorrow's big meaningless stack of paperwork. But it's all worth it, you know, 'cause at least I know I'm making the world a... place. All right, see you guys later.",6,How I Met Your Mother,290,57
36823,Ted,17, I'm worried about Marshall. He doesn't seem like himself lately.,6,How I Met Your Mother,65,10
36824,Lily,17," Yeah, he's been really... quiet.",6,How I Met Your Mother,33,5
36825,Robin,17," Well, that's just what Minnesota guys are like... strong, silent, you know, man's man.",6,How I Met Your Mother,87,14
36826,Barney,17, Like Prince.,6,How I Met Your Mother,13,2
36827,Lily,17," No, it's more than that. It's like, all the stuff he used to love, he suddenly has no interest in anymore.",6,How I Met Your Mother,107,21
36828,Barney,17, Oh. Ha-wink,6,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
36829,Lily,17, Excuse me?,6,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
36830,Barney,17," Lily, in my travels, I've developed a finely calibrated sense of how long it's been since... How do I not put this delicately?... a girl's been porked. And, boo, you've been pork-free so long, you're practically kosher.",6,How I Met Your Mother,220,37
36831,Lily,17, It's been a while.,6,How I Met Your Mother,19,4
36832,Barney,17," Five weeks, three days by my estimation.",6,How I Met Your Mother,41,7
36833,Lily,17, You should work at a carnival.,6,How I Met Your Mother,31,6
36834,Barney,17, I tried. They're pretty strict with backgrounds.,6,How I Met Your Mother,49,7
36835,Ted,17," Anyway, we should get going.",6,How I Met Your Mother,29,5
36836,Lily,17," Yeah, I'll walk out with you guys.",6,How I Met Your Mother,35,7
36837,Robin,17," Good night. Good night, guys.",6,How I Met Your Mother,30,5
36838,Barney,17, 18 weeks.,6,How I Met Your Mother,10,2
36839,Robin,17," Damn it. Okay, yes, I am in a bit of a dry spell. But I just started a new job, and dating's been on the back burner, and...",6,How I Met Your Mother,125,28
36840,Barney,17," Shh. Child, listen. If you're really hurting for it, I'd be more than happy to throw you one.",6,How I Met Your Mother,94,18
36841,Robin,17, Throw me one? Yeah.,6,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
36842,Barney,17, We're exes. We're probably due for a backslide. Or we could just do it the normal way.,6,How I Met Your Mother,87,17
36843,Robin,17," Oh, I see what's going on.",6,How I Met Your Mother,27,6
36844,Barney,17, Yeah?,6,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
36845,Robin,17," This is about Nora. You met a girl, you liked her, but then you missed your shot. And now you're trying to hook up with your ex-girlfriend to prove to yourself that you don't care.",6,How I Met Your Mother,181,35
36846,Barney,17," Robin, you could not be more... What do you mean I missed my shot?",6,How I Met Your Mother,67,14
36847,Robin,17, Nora met a guy. What?!,6,How I Met Your Mother,23,5
36848,Barney,17, What?,6,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
36849,Robin,17, Yep. Off the market. He's taking her to Cafe L'Amour this Friday night.,6,How I Met Your Mother,72,13
36850,Barney,17," But ""L'Amour"" means love! They're going to the cafe of love! I'm fine. It's fine. Point is, Robin, I don't even like Nora. Damn it!",6,How I Met Your Mother,132,25
36852,Lily,17," Oh, baby, why aren't you in bed?",6,How I Met Your Mother,33,7
36853,Marshall,17, I can't sleep.,6,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
36854,Lily,17, Mmm. Anything I can do to help you with that?,6,How I Met Your Mother,46,10
36855,Marshall,17, Maybe after this documentary on garbage.,6,How I Met Your Mother,41,6
36856,Lily,17," Man, I am losing my touch.",6,How I Met Your Mother,27,6
36858,Marshall,17, I have to save the planet!,6,How I Met Your Mother,27,6
36859,Lily,17, Is it over? I call on top.,6,How I Met Your Mother,27,7
36862,Ted,17, I'm here to...,6,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
36864,Ted,17, Captain. I...,6,How I Met Your Mother,14,2
36866,Ted,17," Pssh, nah...",6,How I Met Your Mother,13,2
36869,Marshall,17, Garbage Island. You haven't heard of Garbage Island? It's an island... made of garbage! It's in the Pacific Ocean. It's twice the size of Texas!,6,How I Met Your Mother,145,25
36870,Robin,17," In other words, one-eighth the size of Canada. So...",6,How I Met Your Mother,53,9
36871,Marshall,17," Guys, I'm going environmental, okay? Phase one",6,How I Met Your Mother,47,7
36873,Marshall,17, You're welcome... Earth. Phase two,6,How I Met Your Mother,35,5
36874,Barney,17," Dude, don't do that. All they're going to hear is ""$12 million,"" and all you're going to hear is the sound of the door smacking your fired ass. And some muffled laughter. Which I apologize for in advance.",6,How I Met Your Mother,205,38
36875,Ted,17," Guys, I got a problem. I ran into The Captain.",6,How I Met Your Mother,47,10
36878,Ted,17, Wow.,6,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
36882,Ted,17, Yes! Limit the search to guys with mustaches. Smart.,6,How I Met Your Mother,53,9
36884,Ted,17, And that's the last time you saw her.,6,How I Met Your Mother,38,8
36886,Ted,17, That's damn good brandy.,6,How I Met Your Mother,25,4
36888,Ted,17," Oh, Captain... don't blame yourself.",6,How I Met Your Mother,37,5
36891,Ted,17, Me. I'm the bad guy.,6,How I Met Your Mother,21,5
36892,Robin,17," Well, maybe to him you are, but in the story of picking up the box for Zoey, you're the hero.",6,How I Met Your Mother,94,20
36893,Ted,17, Damn it! The box!,6,How I Met Your Mother,18,4
36896,Marshall,17," Baby, baby, I really got to work on this presentation.",6,How I Met Your Mother,55,10
36897,Lily,17," Oh, that's too bad, 'cause I was going to make a little presentation of my own.",6,How I Met Your Mother,80,16
36898,Marshall,17," Okay, why not",6,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
36899,Lily,17," Deal. Come on, come on.",6,How I Met Your Mother,24,5
36900,Marshall,17, Lily!,6,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
36902,Barney,17, You lying little minx. I happened to be at Cafe L'Amour tonight from 5,6,How I Met Your Mother,71,14
36903,Robin,17, Sorry. Who said anything about an...?,6,How I Met Your Mother,38,6
36904,Barney,17," Come on, you just know he's an Italian race car driver.",6,How I Met Your Mother,56,11
36905,Robin,17," No, he's not. He doesn't exist. I made the whole thing up to see if you like her. And you do. So you should just call her. Here is her number. And I also programmed it into your phone while you were in the bathroom. Wow. That was a joke. You just got here, remember? You really are smitten.",6,How I Met Your Mother,291,59
36906,Barney,17," No, I'm not. I'm Barney Stinson. I don't get smitten, I smite!",6,How I Met Your Mother,63,12
36907,Robin,17," You are totally smitten, but you're scared of being in a relationship.",6,How I Met Your Mother,71,12
36908,Barney,17," No, I'm not. I can't be anyone's boyfriend, Robin. If I got serious with Nora, it would be like if Mother Teresa focused all her attention on one really hot orphan. With great pen1s comes great responsibility.",6,How I Met Your Mother,210,37
36909,Robin,17," Okay, Mother Teresa, throw me one.",6,How I Met Your Mother,35,6
36910,Barney,17, Sorry?,6,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
36911,Robin,17," I would like it if you threw me one. Fastball, right down the middle. Actually, if I recall correctly, a slight curve.",6,How I Met Your Mother,119,22
36912,Barney,17," Careful, Robin, I'll do it.",6,How I Met Your Mother,28,5
36913,Robin,17," Oh, I don't think you will. Hmm. Because you don't want to screw things up with Nora. Hey, prove me wrong. Tomorrow night, my place.",6,How I Met Your Mother,133,25
36914,Barney,17," Don't poke the dragon, Robin, 'cause the dragon will poke you back.",6,How I Met Your Mother,68,12
36916,Lily,17," s*x now, we'll do the foreplay after.",6,How I Met Your Mother,38,7
36917,Marshall,17," Oh, no, baby, come on. Today didn't go so well.",6,How I Met Your Mother,48,10
36919,Marshall,17," The green initiative, for only $12 million, will change the way...",6,How I Met Your Mother,67,11
36923,Marshall,17," Well, because we can always do more.",6,How I Met Your Mother,37,7
36925,Marshall,17," Well, meeting Sting isn't gonna fix anything, Arthur!",6,How I Met Your Mother,54,8
36932,Marshall,17, Meeker got fired because of me. I'm the bad guy.,6,How I Met Your Mother,49,10
36933,Lily,17," No, sweetie, just-just put all that out of your mind and relax. Look, I got you a six-pack of tall boys from the deli.",6,How I Met Your Mother,119,24
36934,Marshall,17," Hey, baby.",6,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
36935,Lily,17, Yeah?,6,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
36936,Marshall,17, What happened to the plastic rings that held the six-pack together?,6,How I Met Your Mother,68,11
36937,Lily,17," Oh, I-I don't know. I threw them down the garbage chute. Let's just use the handcuffs instead.",6,How I Met Your Mother,95,17
36938,Marshall,17," Baby, birds can get caught in those and then they dwown in a sea of wubbish! Weren't you listening? Don't you care about Garbage Island?",6,How I Met Your Mother,137,25
36939,Lily,17," Marshall, right now, I don't give a wat's ass about Garbage Island.",6,How I Met Your Mother,68,12
36940,Marshall,17," Well, I do. I got to find those rings!",6,How I Met Your Mother,39,9
36941,Lily,17, Cwap.,6,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
36943,Ted,17," Hi, I'm here to pick up...",6,How I Met Your Mother,27,6
36945,Ted,17, To the study?,6,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
36947,Ted,17, Know what?,6,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
36949,Ted,17, That son of a bitch! You think Zoey's sleeping with the doorman?,6,How I Met Your Mother,65,12
36951,Ted,17," No, no, no, you can't fire him.",6,How I Met Your Mother,32,7
36953,Ted,17," Oh, my God! No, no! No physical retribution! Stop!",6,How I Met Your Mother,51,9
36955,Ted,17," Look, look, yes, yes, the doorman is a scoundrel. The mustache alone gives that away. He's a rake, a rogue, a rapscallion!",6,How I Met Your Mother,123,22
36957,Ted,17," But it's not his fault, okay? It's nobody's fault. You and Zoey have nothing in common. For God's sake, Captain, she hates boats! You're just not right for each other. Look, I know it's tough to face, but I'm sure a small part of you has always known that.",6,How I Met Your Mother,257,49
36959,Ted,17, Of course they do. And you'll find one. And you'll be much happier with her than you ever were with Zoey.,6,How I Met Your Mother,106,21
36961,Ted,17," Yeah, yeah! And, you know, since, since it doesn't really matter who Zoey's dating now...",6,How I Met Your Mother,90,15
36963,Ted,17, It's me. You're welcome.,6,How I Met Your Mother,25,4
36966,Lily,17," Okay, baby, what gives?",6,How I Met Your Mother,24,4
36967,Marshall,17," I'm sorry, but neither of us are getting any action until I find those rings.",6,How I Met Your Mother,78,15
36968,Lily,17, I hope this doesn't make me look desperate.,6,How I Met Your Mother,44,8
36970,Barney,17," All right, Robin, give it to me.",6,How I Met Your Mother,33,7
36971,Robin,17," Damn it, Barney, you failed my test! You know, I- I try to root for you. Even as your ex-girlfriend, when you meet someone, I'm like, ""Yeah, Barney, go get her!"" But you know what? Just forget it. You're never gonna change. I'm done trying to help you.",6,How I Met Your Mother,253,48
36972,Barney,17," The number. Give me the number, 'cause I really can't tell... Is that a seven or a nine?",6,How I Met Your Mother,89,18
36973,Robin,17," It's a five, idiot.",6,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
36974,Barney,17, A fi...? In what moon man language is that a five?,6,How I Met Your Mother,51,11
36975,Robin,17," ""Moon man language""? What does that even mean?",6,How I Met Your Mother,47,8
36976,Barney,17, How am I supposed to see that's a five?,6,How I Met Your Mother,40,9
36977,Robin,17, Look how you taped this up...,6,How I Met Your Mother,30,6
36978,Barney,17," Fine, fine, fine. I have a phone call to make.",6,How I Met Your Mother,47,10
36979,Robin,17, Barney. Go get her.,6,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
36981,Ted,17," Listen, Zoey, I need to ask you something. Did I steal you?",6,How I Met Your Mother,60,12
36983,Ted,17, So I'm the bad guy. Great.,6,How I Met Your Mother,27,6
36985,Ted,17, If you say so.,6,How I Met Your Mother,15,4
36988,Lily,17," Okay, Marshall, seriously, what's going on?",6,How I Met Your Mother,44,6
36989,Marshall,17, He'll never get to see how I turn out.,6,How I Met Your Mother,39,9
36990,Lily,17, What do you mean?,6,How I Met Your Mother,18,4
36991,Marshall,17," My dad. You know, I used to, um, I used to always tell him that I was gonna be an environmental lawyer. And he was always so proud of me for that. But he never got to see the version of me that was anything but a corporate stooge. And now it's too late. And we're starting a family, you know.",6,How I Met Your Mother,293,61
36992,Lily,17, Are you avoiding sleeping with me 'cause you don't want to start a family?,6,How I Met Your Mother,75,14
36993,Marshall,17," Lily, if we have a baby right now, that is just it for me. The cement will dry, and I will be stuck at GNB forever.",6,How I Met Your Mother,116,26
36994,Lily,17," Marshall, if you want to quit your job and go work for the NRDC right now, then you need to do that right now. And then, once you've cleaned up all the oceans and saved the planet... you know, like, a year from now... then we'll start a family.",6,How I Met Your Mother,245,49
36995,Marshall,17," I don't know. So far, in the name of saving the planet, I've ruined your night, I practically broke Wendy's back and I got Meeker fired. The guy must hate me.",6,How I Met Your Mother,159,31
36996,Lily,17, Meeker doesn't hate you.,6,How I Met Your Mother,25,4
37013,Ted,17, Wow. That's a pretty good omelet.,6,How I Met Your Mother,34,6
37015,Ted,17," No, no, no. Wow, that did not end well. But it's all for the best, 'cause now I'm married to an amazing girl, we have two kids. It's actually a funny story of how we met. I was a best man at this wedding...",6,How I Met Your Mother,207,44
37017,Ted,17," Okay, well, have a safe trip. It was great seeing you.  Hello. Marshall.",6,How I Met Your Mother,73,13
37018,Marshall,17," Hey, Ted.",6,How I Met Your Mother,10,2
37019,Ted,17, Hey. You will not believe who I just ran into.,6,How I Met Your Mother,47,10
37022,Barney,18," I don't need to go to a heart doctor. I drink every day, I sleep three hours every night, and I have multiple s*x partners. I'm doing everything right.",6,How I Met Your Mother,152,29
37023,Ted,18," Barney, come on, this is important. We need you around for a long time. Without you, we'd have to find some other sex-fueled, depraved animal to entertain us.",6,How I Met Your Mother,159,28
37024,Robin,18,"  Actually, I'm thinking about getting a dog again.",6,How I Met Your Mother,51,8
37025,Lily,18," Oh, can she? Can she get a dog, please Dad?",6,How I Met Your Mother,44,10
37026,Ted,18," No. If you get a dog, I'm going to be the one stuck taking care of it.",6,How I Met Your Mother,71,17
37027,Robin,18,  You wouldn't have to take care of it.,6,How I Met Your Mother,39,8
37028,Ted,18, Really? And who watered the philodendron on your bookcase and sang it back to life?,6,How I Met Your Mother,84,15
37029,Robin,18,"  Yeah, that was made out of silk, Ted.",6,How I Met Your Mother,39,8
37030,Marshall,18," Okay, Robin, what you need is indeed something that buries a bone, but I'm not talking about a dog. I'm talking about a man.",6,How I Met Your Mother,125,24
37031,Robin,18,  Here we go.,6,How I Met Your Mother,13,3
37032,Marshall,18," You're clearly trying to fill a hole... in her heart. You feel like the seventh wheel, because now Ted is with Zoey and Barney's with Nora and Lily's with Big Fudge.",6,How I Met Your Mother,166,31
37033,Barney,18," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Big Fudge. ""With""? I am not ""with"" Nora. Wrong preposition. Later tonight I'm hoping to be on Nora, right? Or under Nora, right? Or, we're all adults, I'll just say it... behind Nora.",6,How I Met Your Mother,232,41
37034,Robin,18,  I don't know. This will be your second date.,6,How I Met Your Mother,46,9
37035,Lily,18," Oh, Barney's got feeling for a girl.",6,How I Met Your Mother,37,7
37036,Barney,18," Yeah. pen1s feelings. Because she's hot. Guys, as you know, I only have one rule...",6,How I Met Your Mother,84,15
37039,Barney,18," If you're gonna get it on in a Port-O-Potty, do it early in the day  Never screw over a girl whose last name ends in a vowel. 'Cause she's got brothers  Never date a girl with a hook for a hand ",6,How I Met Your Mother,195,41
37041,Barney,18, Never go out with the same girl more than once.,6,How I Met Your Mother,48,10
37042,Lily,18, Then why are you going out with Nora again?,6,How I Met Your Mother,44,9
37043,Barney,18, There is an exception.,6,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
37046,Barney,18,...unless she's hot ...unless she's hot ...unless she's hot.,6,How I Met Your Mother,60,9
37048,Barney,18," And she is indeed hot. Which is why nothing, not even God himself... yeah, I said it, Beardy... is going to stand in the way of tonight being legend... Wait for it. ",6,How I Met Your Mother,166,32
37050,Barney,18," Hey, Nora, sorry I'm late. I'm just, uh, just getting over a cold.",6,How I Met Your Mother,67,13
37052,Barney,18, About 20 minutes. Can't seem to shake it.,6,How I Met Your Mother,42,8
37054,Barney,18, Handsome? Rich? Well-endowed?,6,How I Met Your Mother,30,3
37056,Barney,18, The bed... that's where all the...happens.,6,How I Met Your Mother,43,6
37060,Barney,18, Ah. Thank you.,6,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
37062,Barney,18," Good night, Mommy.",6,How I Met Your Mother,19,3
37064,Lily,18," Wow, she nursed you back to health?",6,How I Met Your Mother,36,7
37065,Barney,18, No. I didn't even see her boobs. She just took care of me.,6,How I Met Your Mother,59,13
37066,Robin,18,"  Oh, hey, guys. This is Nate. Nate, these are my friends.",6,How I Met Your Mother,58,11
37068,Ted,18," Uh, yeah, it's right in here... Scooby.",6,How I Met Your Mother,40,7
37070,Marshall,18," Oh, Robin, if you weren't so much stronger than me, I would slap you.",6,How I Met Your Mother,70,14
37071,Robin,18,  What? You told me to meet someone.,6,How I Met Your Mother,36,7
37072,Marshall,18," I know, and, look, he seems plenty nice, but I didn't mean bring home the first guy you bump into on the street.",6,How I Met Your Mother,113,23
37073,Robin,18,"  Actually, I met him in the park.",6,How I Met Your Mother,34,7
37074,Ted,18, Should have just let you get a dog.,6,How I Met Your Mother,36,8
37075,Barney,18," Oh, oh, I should go. Lily, can I talk to you for a second? So, um, I made an appointment with that cardiologist.",6,How I Met Your Mother,113,23
37076,Lily,18," Aw, and you want me to go with you 'cause you're a little scared?",6,How I Met Your Mother,66,14
37077,Barney,18, No.,6,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
37078,Lily,18, Do you want me to go with you because you're a lot scared?,6,How I Met Your Mother,59,13

37134,Robin,18,  He's not a dog.,6,How I Met Your Mother,17,4

37245,Ted,18," What did Barney mean when he said ""calzone""?",6,How I Met Your Mother,45,8

37264,Robin,18,"  ""Got out""? What do you mean?",6,How I Met Your Mother,30,6
37265,Ted,18, He just walked out of the apartment. Someone must've left the door open.,6,How I Met Your Mother,73,13
37266,Marshall,18, It wasn't me.,6,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
37267,Lily,18, Me neither. He must've figured out how to open it himself.,6,How I Met Your Mother,59,11
37268,Ted,18, He's so smart. We should get him on Letterman doing tricks.,6,How I Met Your Mother,60,11
37269,Marshall,18, I know Paul Schaffer's sandwich guy. This could happen.,6,How I Met Your Mother,56,9
37270,Robin,18,  Guys. Get yourselves together and start looking for Scooby. I'm on my way home.,6,How I Met Your Mother,81,14
37271,Ted,18, Wait wait! Robin. Can you pick up some calzones?,6,How I Met Your Mother,49,9
37272,Barney,18," Wait... Nora, wait. Wait. I'm sorry I misled you.",6,How I Met Your Mother,50,9
37274,Barney,18, I was on the spot. This is your fault.,6,How I Met Your Mother,39,9
37276,Barney,18," Yeah, with the whole ""I want to get married"" thing. You can't just tell someone exactly what you want out of a relationship. This... isn't England.",6,How I Met Your Mother,148,26
37279,Ted,18, Great idea.,6,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
37280,Marshall,18," No, great idea!",6,How I Met Your Mother,16,3
37281,Lily,18," Okay. If you were new in town and had just ingested an eighth of sandwich, where would you go?",6,How I Met Your Mother,95,19

37293,Barney,18," Okay. Maybe, eventually, I could settle down. 50 years from now, if I have like a Hefner thing going on with some really hot twins. But those twins won't even be born for another... 32 years. I mean... Nora's great. She's wonderful. But...",6,How I Met Your Mother,240,43
37294,Lily,18, What time was your dinner reservation?,6,How I Met Your Mother,39,6

37310,Ted,19," Vintage rolltop desk here. I haven't decided whether to put the fern on the right or the left side, but you know, sometimes you just gotta wing it. Right? Left side. Oh, and right outside, I want to put up a basketball hoop for the kids.",6,How I Met Your Mother,238,46
37311,Barney,19," Ted. This is your seduction lounge. s*x swing there, vibrating Jell-O pit right there, rotating Vietnamese Shame Wheel right here. Don't ask; you're not ready.

37312,Marshall,19," Hey. Barney, let's go outside for a second.",6,How I Met Your Mother,44,8
37313,Lily,19,  We have a confession. This wasn't really about seeing Ted's house. It's an intervention.,6,How I Met Your Mother,90,14
37314,Barney,19," Oh, thank God. I'll go first. Ted, this hous you bought for your hypothetical family is super weird. We talk about it all the time behind your back.",6,How I Met Your Mother,149,28
37315,Ted,19, Yeah. This intervention isn't for me. It's for you,6,How I Met Your Mother,51,9
37319,Marshall,19," Barney, I can't believe your giant TV is broken. It's March Madness.",6,How I Met Your Mother,69,12
37320,Ted,19," Okay, uh, I think I see what the problem is. Barney, can you grab me a screwdriver?",6,How I Met Your Mother,84,17
37321,Barney,19," Sure thing. Luis. Barney Stinson, 12 H. I got a hundred bucks if you can be here in five. Thanks.",6,How I Met Your Mother,98,20
37322,Lily,19,  You call the super for a screwdriver?,6,How I Met Your Mother,39,7
37323,Barney,19," Yeah... here's the thing about me and tools... the only one I know how to use is attached to me, and I am not going to try putting it in the TV. Again.",6,How I Met Your Mother,152,33
37324,Ted,19," Okay, that's ridiculous. Everyone should know how to use tools.",6,How I Met Your Mother,64,10
37326,Barney,19," Well, here's our screwdriver now.  Guys, I'm pretty sure that's not Luis, but I can't be certain. Someone introduce yourself.",6,How I Met Your Mother,126,20
37328,Barney,19, Dad?,6,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
37331,Marshall,19, I can't believe Barney is talking to his dad right now.,6,How I Met Your Mother,56,11
37332,Robin,19," Yeah, what do you say after three decades of not seeing each other?",6,How I Met Your Mother,68,13
37333,Lily,19,"  ""So, how 'bout those last 30 Super Bowls""?",6,How I Met Your Mother,44,8
37334,Ted,19," Okay, now I feel bad about making fun of him for the tool thing. My dad was the one who taught me all that stuff.",6,How I Met Your Mother,114,25
37335,Robin,19," Well, to be fair, everyone has some glaring gap in knowledge, something really obvious you somehow never learned.",6,How I Met Your Mother,114,18
37336,Ted,19," Okay, but a screwdriver? Come on, I don't have any gaps that fundamental.",6,How I Met Your Mother,74,13
37337,Robin,19, Really? I seem to recall...,6,How I Met Your Mother,28,5
37339,Ted,19, Daniel Burnham was an architect whose ever-shifting style and aesthetic made him a true architectural chamma-leeon. And only the most gifted chamma-leeon could've designed classic beaux arts masterpieces right alongside sleek modern flatirons. His name might as well have been Daniel Chamma-leeon.,6,How I Met Your Mother,298,42
37342,Ted,19," Betty, I'm pretty sure it's pronounced ""chamma-leeon,"" so... Class dismissed. No homework. For a while.",6,How I Met Your Mother,104,15
37344,Ted,19," Okay, I learned that word by reading it. That's how I've always pronounced it.",6,How I Met Your Mother,79,14
37345,Robin,19," Ted, that wasn't easy. It took a lot of ""ch-aracter"" to admit that.",6,How I Met Your Mother,68,13
37346,Ted,19," Okay, Scherbatsky. You want to tussle? I'll tussle.",6,How I Met Your Mother,52,8

37349,Robin,19," Please, no.",6,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
37352,Robin,19," Seriously? The North Pole? Okay, pal, if you want to break up with me, just tell it to me straight. Don't pretend you're going someplace we all know doesn't exist.",6,How I Met Your Mother,164,30
37354,Robin,19," Of who? Santa's elves? Rudolph? You know what? I'm going on a trip, too, Scott. It, uh, starts in Narnia. It works its way up to Candyland, and then, hey, congratulate me, because I'm the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts. Expelliarmus!",6,How I Met Your Mother,257,45
37356,Robin,19, So... you want to get pizza later? Or...,6,How I Met Your Mother,41,8
37359,Robin,19, I still think about him in the shower.,6,How I Met Your Mother,39,8
37361,Ted,19," Hey. Tell us everything. How'd it go, bud?",6,How I Met Your Mother,43,8
37362,Barney,19, Where do I begin?,6,How I Met Your Mother,18,4
37365,Barney,19, Yeah. I think I need a drink.,6,How I Met Your Mother,30,7
37369,Barney,19," Look, it's been 30 years. And now you just show up out of nowhere? This is... this is going to take me a minute.",6,How I Met Your Mother,113,24
37371,Barney,19," I love you, Daddy. I'm so glad we're best friends now.",6,How I Met Your Mother,55,11
37373,Barney,19, Make a muscle.,6,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
37375,Barney,19, Ah!,6,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
37377,Barney,19," Guys, my dad's awesome. He's the mother of all fathers. Check this out.",6,How I Met Your Mother,72,13
37379,Barney,19," Hey, back when I was a kid, you used to be a roadie. Do you still do that?",6,How I Met Your Mother,75,18
37383,Barney,19," So, all these years, there's this one question I've been dying to ask him.",6,How I Met Your Mother,75,14
37384,Lily,19,  Why did you abandon me?,6,How I Met Your Mother,25,5
37385,Marshall,19, Why'd you wait so long to contact me?,6,How I Met Your Mother,38,8
37386,Robin,19," You've hurt me before, why should I trust you now?",6,How I Met Your Mother,51,10
37388,Barney,19, Do you... get laid a lot?,6,How I Met Your Mother,26,6
37390,Barney,19," Oh, my God, that took you five seconds.",6,How I Met Your Mother,40,8
37392,Barney,19, You're a master. You are legen... wait for it...,6,How I Met Your Mother,49,9
37394,Barney,19,"...daddy! Legendaddy! The man is a god. And he's still out there, living the dream.",6,How I Met Your Mother,83,15
37397,Barney,19," Oh, that's cool.",6,How I Met Your Mother,17,3
37399,Barney,19, This is going to be the second-most fun I've ever had on an Asian leg. ,6,How I Met Your Mother,72,15
37401,Lily,19,"  Barney, we... we know you're psyched, but just... be careful.",6,How I Met Your Mother,63,10
37402,Barney,19, What do you mean?,6,How I Met Your Mother,18,4
37403,Ted,19," Well, this guy has flaked out on your whole life. It sounds like he just might be telling you what you want to hear.",6,How I Met Your Mother,117,24
37404,Robin,19," Barney, we just don't want to see you get hurt.",6,How I Met Your Mother,48,10
37405,Barney,19," First of all, Robin, my dad could beat up your dad. Second, you don't have to worry. He's cool. Now if you'll excuse me... I have to go renew my passport, and get a travel-sized rotating Vietnamese Shame Wheel. Don't ask; you're not ready.",6,How I Met Your Mother,240,44
37407,Ted,19," I hope Barney's dad isn't just pretending to be something he's not, you know?",6,How I Met Your Mother,78,14
37408,Lily,19,  Yeah. That would make Jerry a real chamma-leeon.,6,How I Met Your Mother,50,8
37409,Ted,19," You have gaps, too, Lily.",6,How I Met Your Mother,26,5
37410,Lily,19,  You got nothing on me.,6,How I Met Your Mother,24,5
37412,Marshall,19," Hey, Lily, can you toss me a beer?",6,How I Met Your Mother,35,8
37413,Lily,19,"  Sure, honey. ",6,How I Met Your Mother,15,2
37415,Ted,19, You have terrible aim.,6,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
37416,Lily,19,  That's not true.,6,How I Met Your Mother,18,3
37417,Marshall,19," Lily, at our apartment, you're the one who pees on the floor.",6,How I Met Your Mother,62,12
37418,Robin,19," Oh, my God. Barney's dad.",6,How I Met Your Mother,26,5
37420,Marshall,19," Yeah, but... aren't you supposed to be off managing some tour in Australia?",6,How I Met Your Mother,76,13
37422,Lily,19,"  What do you mean, Barney won't return your calls? He said you two had an amazing night together.",6,How I Met Your Mother,98,18
37425,Barney,19, I'm not sure how to start this.,6,How I Met Your Mother,32,7
37427,Barney,19, I think I need a drink.,6,How I Met Your Mother,24,6
37429,Barney,19," Glen McKenna, neat.",6,How I Met Your Mother,20,3
37431,Barney,19," Milk? Oh, you're taking it easy. Crazy night?",6,How I Met Your Mother,46,8
37433,Barney,19, Wow.,6,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
37435,Barney,19," Hey, um.. When I was a kid, you used to be a roadie. You still do that?",6,How I Met Your Mother,72,17
37437,Barney,19," Yeah, no, I get it. Um, but when I was a kid, you... you were this total badass.",6,How I Met Your Mother,81,18
37439,Barney,19," Yeah, okay, now we're getting to the good stuff.",6,How I Met Your Mother,49,9
37441,Barney,19," Yes, yes, yes.",6,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
37443,Barney,19, *Out of control.*,6,How I Met Your Mother,18,3
37445,Barney,19, You ever bang Stevie Nicks?,6,How I Met Your Mother,28,5
37454,Barney,19, Big-time.,6,How I Met Your Mother,10,1
37456,Barney,19," Oh, my God, you're a natural. Think of the pickup plays we can run as a father-son duo. There's the ""Father Knows Breast,"" there's the ""Bush Dynasty,"" the ""Lick Father, Lick Son.""",6,How I Met Your Mother,180,32
37458,Barney,19, Why?,6,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
37460,Barney,19," You're all wearing matching sweaters. That's cute. Look, I got to get going, Jerry. But, uh, this was great. Glad we did this.",6,How I Met Your Mother,127,23
37465,Lily,19,  We think you should give him another chance. That's the real reason we're out here. He lives ten minutes away.,6,How I Met Your Mother,112,20
37466,Barney,19, What?,6,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
37467,Marshall,19, You're having dinner with him tonight.,6,How I Met Your Mother,39,6
37468,Barney,19," No, I most certainly am not. Look, I met him. He's not my kind of bro and that's that.",6,How I Met Your Mother,87,19
37469,Robin,19, Are you sure it's not more than that?,6,How I Met Your Mother,38,8
37470,Barney,19," Guys, get it through your heads. I am never gonna talk to my dad again.",6,How I Met Your Mother,72,15
37471,Marshall,19," No, Barney. I'm never gonna talk to my dad again. But your dad is alive and he lives just down the road.",6,How I Met Your Mother,105,22
37472,Barney,19," Fine, I'll go.",6,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
37473,Marshall,19," Awesome. Um, Lily, keys.  I'm literally 11 inches from you.",6,How I Met Your Mother,60,10
37477,Barney,19," Oh, thank you very much. And I love your...coat. I love your coat.",6,How I Met Your Mother,67,13
37479,Barney,19," Well, I do love it. It's doing a nice job covering up that chair.",6,How I Met Your Mother,66,14
37481,Lily,19,  Guess now we wait.,6,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
37482,Marshall,19," Hey, I got an idea how to pass the time. A little trivia game. Robin, reindeer",6,How I Met Your Mother,79,16
37483,Robin,19," Okay, I'm not an idiot. Reindeer are obviously f... re... fake?",6,How I Met Your Mother,64,11
37484,Marshall,19," Yikes! I'm surrounded by a bunch of dum-dums. Good thing I don't have any gaps in my knowledge. I am perfect. Oh, for the love of God, guys, enough already.",6,How I Met Your Mother,157,30
37485,Lily,19,"  What, baby?",6,How I Met Your Mother,13,2
37486,Marshall,19, You've been treating me with kid gloves ever since my dad died.,6,How I Met Your Mother,64,12
37487,Robin,19, That's not true.,6,How I Met Your Mother,17,3
37488,Lily,19,"  Robin, don't disagree with Marshall.",6,How I Met Your Mother,38,5
37489,Robin,19, I'm sorry.,6,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
37490,Marshall,19, I first noticed it at the bar.,6,How I Met Your Mother,31,7
37492,Marshall,19," Hey, Lily,  Can you get me a mojito? Normally, you would've given me crap for an hour about a voice crack that pubescently girl-like, but nothing. So then I started to test you guys.  The Phantom Menace is by far the best Star Wars movie.",6,How I Met Your Mother,239,45
37493,Barney,19," It ages well, that's the thing.",6,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
37494,Marshall,19, You guys like my new soul patch?,6,How I Met Your Mother,33,7
37495,Robin,19," Righteous hair tab, brotha.",6,How I Met Your Mother,28,4
37496,Marshall,19," And once I figured it out, I started doing crazy stuff to see how far you'd let me go. Hey, guys. This is Rex. He's a possum. I found him in the trash. He lives with us now.",6,How I Met Your Mother,174,38
37497,Lily,19,  I love him.,6,How I Met Your Mother,13,3
37499,Marshall,19," Lily, we are living with a possum. Rex is violent and he hates us.",6,How I Met Your Mother,67,14
37500,Lily,19,"  But, baby, you just lost your dad. None of us wants to upset you.",6,How I Met Your Mother,67,14
37501,Marshall,19," Please. If you guys really want me to get over the worst tragedy of my life, I'm begging you, tear me a new one. But not like Rex tried to in my sleep last night.",6,How I Met Your Mother,163,35
37504,Barney,19, I do remember that. I climbed up on that dude's lap and told him what I wanted for Christmas.,6,How I Met Your Mother,94,19
37507,Barney,19," J.J., I'm talking to Dad right now. God.",6,How I Met Your Mother,41,8
37508,Marshall,19," Seriously, it's time. What are my gaps?",6,How I Met Your Mother,40,7
37509,Ted,19," Well, I guess maybe one gap you have is... you can't wink.",6,How I Met Your Mother,59,12
37512,Marshall,19," Don't you think that maybe we should go home and, uh, ""do the laundry""",6,How I Met Your Mother,71,14
37514,Lily,19,  You can't swallow pills.,6,How I Met Your Mother,26,4
37516,Robin,19," Ooh, ooh, I got one. You think John Kennedy and Jack Kennedy are the same person.  Right? What?",6,How I Met Your Mother,96,18
37519,Barney,19," Yeah, I do. I make a ton of money. How much do you make, J.J.?",6,How I Met Your Mother,63,15
37521,Barney,19," Oh, well, huh, now we all know you make excuses. I was talking about money.",6,How I Met Your Mother,76,15
37524,Barney,19," Good time to get into print media. Am I right, Dad?",6,How I Met Your Mother,52,11
37529,Barney,19," Uh, you don't strike me as the athletic type, Jayj. Dad, check it. Triceps. What gym do you go to?",6,How I Met Your Mother,99,20
37531,Barney,19," Sounds like you're having your fourth period. Am I right, Dad?!",6,How I Met Your Mother,64,11
37535,Barney,19, Why? J.J. started it. What does J.J. even stand for anyway? J... Jerky... Jerkface?,6,How I Met Your Mother,84,14
37537,Barney,19, Jerome Jr...? Oh. He's... he's named after you. Excuse me.,6,How I Met Your Mother,59,10
37540,Ted,19, You always add too much water to oatmeal.,6,How I Met Your Mother,42,8
37541,Marshall,19," Yes, I drown the son of a bitch.",6,How I Met Your Mother,33,8
37542,Robin,19, You consistently miss at least one belt loop.,6,How I Met Your Mother,46,8
37543,Marshall,19, It's like I'm blind.,6,How I Met Your Mother,21,4
37544,Lily,19,  You're too old to ask to see the cockpit.,6,How I Met Your Mother,43,9
37545,Marshall,19," Whoa. Whoa. Guys, my dad just died.",6,How I Met Your Mother,36,7
37546,Lily,19,"  Aw, honey.",6,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
37547,Marshall,19," No, I'm just kidding. This is great. I really, I really missed this.",6,How I Met Your Mother,69,13
37550,Barney,19, This is mine.,6,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
37552,Barney,19," J.J. gets a childhood, a dad, a real family and a basketball hoop? No, no. I at least get the hoop. I'm taking it with me.",6,How I Met Your Mother,123,26
37554,Barney,19," Why? Why should I? You're lame, okay? You're just some lame suburban dad.",6,How I Met Your Mother,74,13
37556,Barney,19," Because if you were gonna be some lame suburban dad, why couldn't you have been that for me?!",6,How I Met Your Mother,94,18
37558,Barney,19," Oh, ""screwed up"" doesn't even begin to describe...",6,How I Met Your Mother,51,8
37560,Barney,19, Can you help me with this?,6,How I Met Your Mother,27,6
37562,Barney,19, Bye.,6,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
37564,Lily,19,  Are you sure you don't want to talk about it?,6,How I Met Your Mother,47,10
37565,Barney,19," I'm fine. Hey, Ted.",6,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
37566,Ted,19," Yeah, buddy.",6,How I Met Your Mother,13,2
37567,Barney,19," You, uh, still want a basketball hoop out there?",6,How I Met Your Mother,49,9
37568,Ted,19," Oh, well, I also really liked your outdoor stripper pole idea. Yeah, it's fine.",6,How I Met Your Mother,80,14
37569,Barney,19," No, you were right. A kid needs a hoop.",6,How I Met Your Mother,40,9
37578,Barney,20," Ted, why are you dating our arch-enemy?! I mean, Wile E. Coyote wasn't trying to sleep with the Roadrunner.",6,How I Met Your Mother,108,19
37579,Robin,20, Or maybe he was. Think about it. The way that she bats her eyelashes and shakes her tail feathers in his face?  She wants it.,6,How I Met Your Mother,126,25
37580,Lily,20, Isn't it hard for you guys to be on opposite sides of something like this?,6,How I Met Your Mother,75,15
37581,Ted,20," Of course you feel that way, Lily. You and Marshall have basically melded into one big hermaphroditic blob. And that's fine for you guys. But some of us want a partner who challenges us to grow and evolve.",6,How I Met Your Mother,206,38
37582,Lily,20, You guys are in screaming matches all the time.,6,How I Met Your Mother,48,9
37583,Ted,20," Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh. Growing matches.",6,How I Met Your Mother,38,5
37587,Ted,20, The main character is a young spoiled prince thrust into leadership after the death of his father. It's obviously a modern-day retelling of Henry IV!,6,How I Met Your Mother,150,25
37589,Ted,20," Okay, clearly, when we're watching Tommy Boy, we're watching two different movies.",6,How I Met Your Mother,83,12
37591,Ted,20," No, you hang up.",6,How I Met Your Mother,17,4
37593,Ted,20," No, you hang up.",6,How I Met Your Mother,17,4
37595,Ted,20," No, you hang up!  No, you hang up.",6,How I Met Your Mother,35,8
37597,Ted,20," No, you...  Hold on.  Hello?",6,How I Met Your Mother,29,5
37598,Robin,20," For the love of God, will one of you idiots hang up the phone?",6,How I Met Your Mother,63,14
37599,Ted,20, Why would you do that?!,6,How I Met Your Mother,24,5
37601,Ted,20, Who likes that?,6,How I Met Your Mother,16,3
37603,Lily,20, Your relationship sounds exhausting.,6,How I Met Your Mother,37,4
37604,Ted,20," Well, maybe yours is a bit lazy.",6,How I Met Your Mother,33,7
37605,Lily,20," Marshall and I have been together 15 years, and the only debate we've had about Tommy Boy is whether it's awesome or super awesome. That's love, bitch.",6,How I Met Your Mother,152,27
37609,Marshall,20, I have to quit.,6,How I Met Your Mother,16,4
37610,Barney,20, Quit GNB?! Why?,6,How I Met Your Mother,16,3
37611,Marshall,20," I need to do better things with my life, okay? There's-There's an opening for an environmental lawyer at the National Resources Defense Council. Sure, it pays less, but I'd be saving the oceans, saving endangered species...",6,How I Met Your Mother,224,36
37612,Barney,20," Saving chicken bones and an old boot to make hobo soup? Marshall, you can't pay your mortgage with Hacky Sacks and good vibes.",6,How I Met Your Mother,127,23
37613,Lily,20," Baby, you have my full support.",6,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
37614,Barney,20," Well, then, you're not going to be able to pay for that trip to Spain that you've been planning.  Say good-bye to riding around in gondolas, and eating bratwurst and seeing the pyramids.",6,How I Met Your Mother,187,33
37615,Robin,20,I don't think you know what Spain is.,6,How I Met Your Mother,37,8
37616,Barney,20," Well, I know that a trip there costs some serious lira.",6,How I Met Your Mother,56,11
37617,Ted,20, It's dinero.,6,How I Met Your Mother,13,2
37618,Barney,20, Where? I want his autograph!,6,How I Met Your Mother,29,5
37620,Robin,20, It's graduation goggles.,6,How I Met Your Mother,25,3
37621,Marshall,20, What?,6,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
37622,Robin,20,"Graduation goggles, like with high school. It's four years of bullies making fun of all the kids with braces, even after the braces come off and they can walk just fine. But then, on graduation day, you suddenly get all misty because you realize you're never going to see those jerks again. I just had graduation goggles with that guy Scooby I dated.",6,How I Met Your Mother,350,63
37623,Lily,20, The guy who was basically a dog?,6,How I Met Your Mother,33,7
37624,Robin,20,He was the worst kisser I've ever been with. But the moment I decided to dump him...I suddenly got kind of wistful. ,6,How I Met Your Mother,116,22
37625,Barney,20," Yeah. I've been there, too. Every time I'm done having s*x with a woman, at first,I never want to see her again. No, that's pretty much it.",6,How I Met Your Mother,140,27
37626,Robin,20,"The point is, you can't trust graduation goggles. They're just as misleading as beer goggles, bridesmaid goggles, and that's-just-a-bulky, outdated-cell-phone in-his-front-pocket goggles. That one was a bummer.",6,How I Met Your Mother,210,27
37627,Marshall,20," You're right. Tomorrow, I'm quitting GNB.",6,How I Met Your Mother,42,6
37628,Barney,20," No! You can't quit tomorrow! The lady with the big nipples is coming back to give another sexual harassment seminar, and I bribed one of the maintenance guys to keep the room at a brisk 55 degrees!",6,How I Met Your Mother,198,37
37629,Lily,20," Baby, more than ever, you have my full support. ",6,How I Met Your Mother,49,9
37631,Ted,20," You know, sometimes I feel bad for Lily and Marshall.",6,How I Met Your Mother,54,10
37632,Lily,20, I'm starting to feel bad for Ted and Zoey.,6,How I Met Your Mother,43,9
37633,Barney,20," It starts with an... ""L?""",6,How I Met Your Mother,26,5
37635,Ted,20, It's like they never challenge each other. They just automatically agree all the time.,6,How I Met Your Mother,87,14
37637,Ted,20,"Yes, they do.",6,How I Met Your Mother,13,3
37639,Ted,20,"Yes, they do. It's like they...",6,How I Met Your Mother,31,6
37642,Barney,20, And I said my name was...?,6,How I Met Your Mother,27,6
37645,Marshall,20," Baby, I did it! I quit. And then I walked right over to the NRDC, and I took that job.",6,How I Met Your Mother,87,20
37646,Lily,20," Oh, good for you, sweetie.",6,How I Met Your Mother,27,5
37647,Marshall,20," Yeah. It's a little less money than I was expecting. I mean, compared to what I was making at GNB, it's nothing. Actually compared to anything, it's nothing. It's nothing. The paid position just got filled, so all I can do is-is volunteer right now. You're cool with that, right?",6,How I Met Your Mother,280,50
37648,Lily,20," Baby, if this is what you need to do, we'll figure it out. How's Barney handling you leaving?",6,How I Met Your Mother,94,18
37651,Ted,20," Hey, Barney, there's a bunch of models in the lobby, and the gossip is one of them is really a dude. You want to play ""Who's Hot and Who's Scott?""",6,How I Met Your Mother,147,30
37652,Barney,20," It's always the one in the turtleneck, Ted. And no, I don't want to play. Stupid Marshall-... ruined everything.",6,How I Met Your Mother,113,19
37653,Ted,20," Oh, come on. Everything's not ruined.",6,How I Met Your Mother,38,6
37656,Ted,20, What? Why?,6,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
37660,Robin,20,"...so, if the Landmarks Preservation Committee sides with Zoey, your whole project goes down the tubes? You must be furious.",6,How I Met Your Mother,124,20
37661,Ted,20, I'm furiously enjoying being challenged.,6,How I Met Your Mother,41,5
37662,Lily,20, Why don't you admit that your girlfriend challenging your every move is getting you a little murder-suicidey?,6,How I Met Your Mother,110,17
37663,Ted,20, Why don't you admit that Marshall quitting his job and taking an unpaid internship is killing you?,6,How I Met Your Mother,99,17
37664,Lily,20, It's not.,6,How I Met Your Mother,10,2
37665,Ted,20," Lily, the downside to having giant, Japanese anime eyes is that they're easy to read. And yours are screaming, ""What about my trip to Spain, deadbeat?""",6,How I Met Your Mother,152,26
37666,Lily,20," Okay, Ted, the downside to having a woman's mouth is, your feminine pout gives away your true feelings. And yours is saying, ""Oh, Zoey, why can't I be on top just this once?""",6,How I Met Your Mother,175,33
37667,Ted,20, We take turns! Sometimes.,6,How I Met Your Mother,26,4
37669,Marshall,20," Hey, guys. Thanks. Hey. I just had the best first day at the NRDC.",6,How I Met Your Mother,67,14
37671,Barney,20, I'm sorry. Sorry. Something Hershel said at work today.,6,How I Met Your Mother,56,9
37672,Robin,20, Hershel?,6,How I Met Your Mother,9,1
37673,Barney,20," What, don't you guys know Hershel? Didn't I tell you? Oh, he's the new lawyer who replaced Marshall at GNB. He is so awesome and funny and tall... taller than Marshall... and he knows way more laws.",6,How I Met Your Mother,199,37
37674,Lily,20," Well, I'm glad you like your new co-worker.",6,How I Met Your Mother,44,8
37675,Barney,20, There's no Hershel! I was just saying that to make you jealous! Why do you insist we play these games?,6,How I Met Your Mother,103,20
37676,Marshall,20," Barney, I'm not playing...",6,How I Met Your Mother,27,4
37677,Barney,20, Just come back to GNB already!,6,How I Met Your Mother,31,6
37678,Marshall,20, I'm really loving my new job.,6,How I Met Your Mother,30,6
37679,Lily,20," Oh, and I'm loving seeing you this happy.",6,How I Met Your Mother,42,8
37680,Marshall,20," I'm so glad to hear you say that because I volunteered our apartment for a big NRDC fund-raiser tomorrow night. You're-You're cool with that, right?",6,How I Met Your Mother,149,25
37681,Lily,20," Baby, you have my full support.",6,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
37682,Marshall,20," Thanks, baby.  Oh. Ooh, I gotta go. The invitations are ready. The party's for a bunch of environmentalists, so I found a guy downtown who makes biodegradable party invitations that can also be used as toilet paper.",6,How I Met Your Mother,216,37
37684,Barney,20, That's how I'm gonna use mine.,6,How I Met Your Mother,31,6
37685,Robin,20, Why in the world do you care so much whether Marshall works at GNB?,6,How I Met Your Mother,68,14
37686,Barney,20," Care? I don't care. I'm like, whatever. Marshall who? He's stupid. Hershel's way better.",6,How I Met Your Mother,89,14
37687,Robin,20,"Okay, Barney, is it possible that with everything that's gone on with your dad lately, you might have some unresolved abandonment issues you're transferring onto Marshall?",6,How I Met Your Mother,171,26
37688,Barney,20," Oh! Ugh! You are worse than my shrink. ""Barney, we have to talk about your father."" ""Barney, I'm not going to teach you how to hypnotize people. You'll only use it for evil."" ""Barney, I am not going to conduct a couples session ""between you and this woman. She's obviously a prostitute."" I don't need this!",6,How I Met Your Mother,307,56
37692,Ted,20," Ah, Lily Aldrin, half of the world's most perfect couple! I was thinking about that woman's mouth comment, and I have three good comebacks. One",6,How I Met Your Mother,144,25
37693,Lily,20," Okay, look, Ted, I need a favor. Would you mind driving out to Kennedy with me to pick up this famous ecologist for Marshall's fund-raiser? Apparently, he only speaks Spanish. And you speak Spanish, right?  Perfect. Let's go.",6,How I Met Your Mother,226,38
37696,Barney,20," Hey, Marshall, it's me. Listen, I know I've been kind of a jerk about your leaving GNB. I just wanted to call and say I'm sorry. No apologies necessary. We're good. Good. Um, hey, any chance you might maybe... I don't know... if you're not busy, uh, want to have lunch today?",6,How I Met Your Mother,276,52
37697,Marshall,20," Oh, buddy, I'd love to, but I can't.",6,How I Met Your Mother,37,8
37698,Barney,20," Oh, that's cool. No biggie. Another time.",6,How I Met Your Mother,42,7
37699,Robin,20,"  Oh, my God!",6,How I Met Your Mother,13,3
37700,Barney,20, How long have you been there?,6,How I Met Your Mother,30,6
37701,Robin,20, You don't remember?,6,How I Met Your Mother,20,3
37703,Robin,20," Hey. I was in the neighborhood. I just wanted to check in on you. You seemed, um, you seemed really upset the other day.",6,How I Met Your Mother,121,24
37704,Barney,20," Oh, no, I'm fine.",6,How I Met Your Mother,18,4
37705,Robin,20," Okay. Well, um, you want to go grab some lunch?",6,How I Met Your Mother,48,10
37706,Barney,20,"Sure. Hey, are you okay if I invite Marshall to join us?",6,How I Met Your Mother,56,12
37707,Robin,20, Yeah.,6,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
37710,Barney,20,"Right. So, um... Chinese?",6,How I Met Your Mother,25,4
37712,Ted,20," You know, just because Zoey and I are a different kind of couple than you and Marshall doesn't make us a worse couple.",6,How I Met Your Mother,119,23
37713,Lily,20," You're right. I-If you and Zoey are happy, then who am I to judge? I'm so sorry.",6,How I Met Your Mother,81,17
37714,Ted,20," Oh, my God, is that how support feels? It's so warm and wonderful. Oh, Lily, I've been so unhappy.",6,How I Met Your Mother,99,19
37715,Lily,20, But I thought you liked being challenged.,6,How I Met Your Mother,42,7
37716,Ted,20," Nobody likes being challenged! Couldn't she agree with me just once, even on something little, like... like what movie to see or-or what topping to get on our pizza or... oh, I don't know, my lifelong dream of building a skyscraper in New York City?!",6,How I Met Your Mother,251,45
37717,Lily,20," Well, in her defense, hamburger pizza, Ted? What are you, 12?",6,How I Met Your Mother,62,11
37718,Ted,20," You were right, Lily. I mean, Zoey's great, but... sometimes I do wish we were a little more like you and Marshall. There he is. Here we go. ",6,How I Met Your Mother,142,28
37720,Ted,20," Um, he speaks perfect English.",6,How I Met Your Mother,31,5
37721,Lily,20," Yeah, I-I know.",6,How I Met Your Mother,16,3
37722,Ted,20, Then why did you ask me to come?,6,How I Met Your Mother,33,8
37723,Lily,20," So you can drive him to the fund-raiser. Supporting Marshall this much is driving me crazy. I'm going to Spain-- my flight leaves in 45 minutes. Adios, muchacho.",6,How I Met Your Mother,162,28
37724,Ted,20," W-Wait, what do you mean you're going to Spain?",6,How I Met Your Mother,48,9
37725,Lily,20," You were right. If I hear myself say ""Baby, you have my full support"" one more time, I swear I'm gonna murder someone!",6,How I Met Your Mother,119,23
37726,Ted,20," What are you gonna tell Marshall, huh? And when are you coming back?",6,How I Met Your Mother,69,13
37727,Lily,20," I honestly haven't thought it all the way through, and I don't intend to. All I know is that I'm a ticking time bomb, and if I don't do something for me right away, I swear I'm gonna explode!",6,How I Met Your Mother,192,39
37728,Ted,20," Wow, tha... that's an evocative metaphor to use for your nonthreatening, totally patriotic emotions. U.S.A.! Okay, Lily, I get it.",6,How I Met Your Mother,131,20
37729,Lily,20, Marshall's been asking a lot lately.,6,How I Met Your Mother,37,6
37730,Ted,20, But the thing to do is-is tell him you've had enough.,6,How I Met Your Mother,54,11
37731,Lily,20," I've never been good at that. And now, ever since his dad died, I-I feel like it's my job to just be fine with everything. But I'm not. I'm not fine that he volunteers our apartment for a giant fund-raiser and that he's not thinking about how we're gonna pay any of our bills and that, apparently, we've given up on trying to have kids.",6,How I Met Your Mother,337,65
37732,Ted,20, Lil...,6,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
37733,Lily,20," Look, I'm sorry, Ted, I just, I gotta do this. ",6,How I Met Your Mother,48,10
37736,Barney,20, There's nothing to talk about.,6,How I Met Your Mother,31,5
37737,Robin,20," You trashed your office today. I mean, you obviously have some deep feelings you're not confronting. And I think they're about your dad.",6,How I Met Your Mother,137,23
37738,Barney,20," I don't want to talk about it, okay?",6,How I Met Your Mother,37,8
37739,Robin,20, Why not?,6,How I Met Your Mother,9,2
37740,Barney,20, Because I don't. And why am I explaining this to you? You're the most secretive person I know. You never tell anybody anything.,6,How I Met Your Mother,128,23
37741,Robin,20," I've never... told anyone this before. Um... I was 16. I was awakened around midnight by the sound of my father arguing with his business partner, Andy Grenier. As things grew heated... I watched my father's hand slowly coil around the heavy antique clock on his desk. The sun was just starting to rise over the bramble orchard as we packed the fresh earth down with the flats of our shovels. My dad and I got our stories straight. We walked back to the house in silence and... haven't talked about it since. But sometimes... on a still night... you can still hear that clock, ticking... ticking... ",6,How I Met Your Mother,600,107
37742,Barney,20, That's... the most harrowing story I've ever heard. Is it true?,6,How I Met Your Mother,64,11
37743,Robin,20," No. But it did get you to drink three scotches, which is why you're ready to spill your guts.",6,How I Met Your Mother,94,19
37744,Barney,20, Fine! The reason I'm upset about Marshall leaving GNB is... is...the meatball sub.,6,How I Met Your Mother,83,13
37745,Robin,20, Huh?,6,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
37746,Barney,20, It all started months ago in the GNB commissary. It was Meatball Sub Day.,6,How I Met Your Mother,74,14
37748,Barney,20," Oh, how I used to love Meatball Sub Day. And then, the most humiliating moment of my life.",6,How I Met Your Mother,91,18
37749,Marshall,20," Hey, buddy, I think you got a tiny little bit of marinara sauce on your tie there.",6,How I Met Your Mother,83,17
37751,Barney,20," I plotted my revenge for weeks. But nothing seemed right. Then it hit me. The answer was so elegant and simple-- an exploding meatball sub. For months, I experimented. More... marinara sauce. Finally, the sub was perfected. The plan was in place. The snare was baited. And then...",6,How I Met Your Mother,281,48
37753,Barney,20,"...he quit, Robin, he quit! It's Meatball Sub Day today, which is why I wanted Marshall to come over and have lunch. But no. All that work wasted.  You want to make God laugh, tell him your plans, right?",6,How I Met Your Mother,203,39
37754,Robin,20, What is wrong with you?,6,How I Met Your Mother,24,5
37756,Marshall,20," Hey, Professor Rodriguez, thank you so much for coming.",6,How I Met Your Mother,56,9
37758,Marshall,20," Right over there. Enjoy. Hey. Hey, thanks for picking him up.",6,How I Met Your Mother,62,11
37759,Ted,20," Yeah, absolutely. Um, listen, something happened at the airport. Um...",6,How I Met Your Mother,71,10
37760,Marshall,20, What?,6,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
37761,Ted,20," Well, we got there, and, uh, Lily... Lily...",6,How I Met Your Mother,45,8
37763,Lily,20," Marshall, hey. Sorry, I, uh, I had to park and-and grab some ice. Sorry.",6,How I Met Your Mother,73,14
37764,Marshall,20," Oh, thanks, babe. You would not believe how much this one has done to help throw this party, Ted. I don't know how she does it. Can't be easy, huh, Lil?",6,How I Met Your Mother,153,31
37765,Lily,20," Yeah. Listen, Marshall, I-I need to talk to you about something.",6,How I Met Your Mother,65,11
37766,Marshall,20," No, you know what? Me, too. Um... I want to thank you for being so supportive of me in all this. I've been at the NRDC for less than a week, and I've already done more to be proud of than in two years at GNB. I can't believe how good it feels. But now, it's time for me to find a way to help the Earth and get paid for it, because I can't put that burden entirely on you. So, starting tomorrow, I'll look for something with a paycheck. What do you think?",6,How I Met Your Mother,455,95
37767,Lily,20," Baby, you have my full support.",6,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
37770,Ted,20, Hey! What are you doing here?,6,How I Met Your Mother,30,6
37772,Ted,20, This you can be supportive of?!,6,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
37774,Ted,20," I have the chance to build a skyscraper in the best city on Earth, and who's the one leading the charge to kill that dream? My girlfriend!",6,How I Met Your Mother,139,27
37779,Lily,20, You're too young. This isn't fair.,6,How I Met Your Mother,35,6
37780,Marshall,20," We're not going anywhere, buddy. We're gonna stay here right till the end.",6,How I Met Your Mother,75,13
37782,Marshall,20," Yes, of course, of course... anything.",6,How I Met Your Mother,39,6
37783,Barney,20, Eat this meatball sub.,6,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
37784,Marshall,20, Wh-Where'd you get a meatball...,6,How I Met Your Mother,33,5
37785,Barney,20, I don't have much time!,6,How I Met Your Mother,24,5
37786,Marshall,20," Okay, yes, yes, of course. Of course. Does this have some sort of special meaning?",6,How I Met Your Mother,83,15
37789,Ted,20," Uh, Barney, you got a little marinara on your pajamas.",6,How I Met Your Mother,55,10
37793,Barney,21," What? That's... What is that word you taught me? ""Bull"" something?",6,How I Met Your Mother,67,11
37795,Barney,21, But you're supposed to take me to see that Zeppelin cover band next week. The night is gonna be... Led-and-Jerry.,6,How I Met Your Mother,114,20
37797,Barney,21, A drunk audience.,6,How I Met Your Mother,18,3
37804,Barney,21, Bye.,6,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
37808,Barney,21," I am so angry at my dad! Guess who called me today. Go on, guess.",6,How I Met Your Mother,66,15
37809,Marshall,21, Mmm. Your dad?,6,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
37810,Barney,21, My dad!,6,How I Met Your Mother,8,2
37813,Barney,21, Barney Stinson.,6,How I Met Your Mother,16,2
37815,Barney,21," Ooh, hold on, let me check my personality. Oh, no. Turns out I would never do that in a million years.",6,How I Met Your Mother,103,21
37817,Barney,21, You do not know how right you are.,6,How I Met Your Mother,35,8
37819,Barney,21, Zero right! We're not getting too old for anything.,6,How I Met Your Mother,52,9
37820,Ted,21," You sure? I feel like we collectively learn the opposite lesson, like, at least once a year.",6,How I Met Your Mother,93,17
37821,Barney,21," I have to face an ugly truth. Jerry Whittaker, my own father, is anti-awesome-etic. I know Crazy Jerry's still in there somewhere, but he's trapped under 20 years of lawnmower parties and carpool barbecues.",6,How I Met Your Mother,207,34
37822,Robin,21," Wow, you know nothing about the suburbs.",6,How I Met Your Mother,41,7
37823,Barney,21,"Well, this Saturday night, I am bustin' him out. I'm gonna make Jerry realize he was wrong about giving up his old life by showing him the awesomest night of all time. And for the awesomest night of all time, I'm going to need the awesomest friends of all time. Okay, who do I know? Guys...! Do any of you know George Clooney?",6,How I Met Your Mother,326,63
37826,Barney,21," Okay, my dad's almost here. I need everything to be as awesome as possible tonight.",6,How I Met Your Mother,84,15
37827,Lily,21, That's why you brought these guys.,6,How I Met Your Mother,35,6
37828,Barney,21,No. That's why I brought these guys.  I've made some minor improvements to your identities. Uh. Mm! You'll find them on these cards.,6,How I Met Your Mother,132,23
37829,Marshall,21, Improvements?!,6,How I Met Your Mother,15,1
37830,Barney,21,Yeah.,6,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
37831,Marshall,21," Bro, we are already the four jiggity-jamminest dudes and dudettes this side of... Okay, let's see the cards.",6,How I Met Your Mother,109,18
37832,Barney,21,"Robin, no one watches the news unless it's a car chase or a nip slip. You are now a professional scotch taster. Lily, Jerry needs to learn that other lifestyles are just as fulfilling as monogamy, so now you and Marshall are in an open marriage.",6,How I Met Your Mother,245,46
37833,Lily,21, Whoo-hoo!,6,How I Met Your Mother,10,1
37834,Marshall,21, Gross!,6,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
37835,Barney,21,"Also, Marshall, you can't just be unemployed, so you are now a gin-swilling, womanizing playwright. And, Ted, just be yourself.  Just kidding. Here's a giant pile of topics you should avoid talking about.",6,How I Met Your Mother,204,33
37836,Ted,21," Well. Well, this could actually be fun. In fact, I believe it was Oscar Wilde who said, ""Man is least himself when he talks...""",6,How I Met Your Mother,128,24
37837,Barney,21,"Ted, card.",6,How I Met Your Mother,10,2
37838,Ted,21," Ah. You're right... ""No quoting Oscar Wilde.""",6,How I Met Your Mother,46,7
37839,Barney,21,"Finally... Robin, you're dating Ted.",6,How I Met Your Mother,36,5
37840,Robin,21," Aw, man! Why?",6,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
37841,Barney,21," I can't have any single female friends lying around. My dad'll be all, Why don't you marry Robin? You guys are cute together. Deep down, you know you were never happier than when you were with her. Uh...  no, thanks.",6,How I Met Your Mother,217,40
37842,Lily,21," Hey, Barney... love the new identities. Little thing... instead of being a naked super ninja, can I be Meryl Streep in The Devil Wears Prada?",6,How I Met Your Mother,142,25
37843,Ted,21, How good was that movie?,6,How I Met Your Mother,25,5
37845,Barney,21, And... hence new identities.,6,How I Met Your Mother,29,4
37849,Barney,21," Jerry, you remember Marshall... he's a well-known writer.",6,How I Met Your Mother,58,8
37850,Marshall,21," Playwright. We're all writers, just some of us don't know what our story is yet.",6,How I Met Your Mother,81,15
37851,Barney,21," Lily, his wife.",6,How I Met Your Mother,16,3
37852,Lily,21," Well, most nights. Mama don't let no ring get in the way of a good time.",6,How I Met Your Mother,73,16
37854,Ted,21," Uh, hi again. Ted. Oh, and, Jerry, you remember my girlfriend.",6,How I Met Your Mother,63,11
37855,Robin,21, Robin. Hi. So nice to see you again.,6,How I Met Your Mother,37,8
37856,Barney,21," Wait, wait. Jerry, I got to tell you the truth. Guys, I'm gonna tell him. We're also a band.",6,How I Met Your Mother,93,19
37858,Robin,21," Two, three, four!",6,How I Met Your Mother,18,3
37862,Barney,21," Oh, we're not drinking here. Tonight we're going big. Let's see, what club should we hit first? There's Club Was, there's Wrong...",6,How I Met Your Mother,131,22
37863,Marshall,21," Um, those places shut down a long time ago.",6,How I Met Your Mother,44,9
37864,Barney,21," Oh, no.",6,How I Met Your Mother,8,2
37865,Marshall,21," Oh, No shut down, too.",6,How I Met Your Mother,23,5

37869,Barney,21," No, Was wasn't where Where was, Was was where Wrong was, right?",6,How I Met Your Mother,64,12
37871,Ted,21, Not Okay. That place is lame.,6,How I Met Your Mother,30,6
37872,Robin,21, Okay is Lame? I thought Lame was a gay bar. Or is that Wrong?,6,How I Met Your Mother,62,14
37873,Marshall,21, That's wrong. That's not Wrong.,6,How I Met Your Mother,32,5
37874,Barney,21," Guys, focus.",6,How I Met Your Mother,13,2
37875,Robin,21," Oh, I like Focus. Let's go there.",6,How I Met Your Mother,34,7
37876,Ted,21, Where?,6,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
37877,Robin,21, Not Where. Focus.,6,How I Met Your Mother,18,3
37878,Lily,21, I thought Focus was closed.,6,How I Met Your Mother,28,5
37879,Barney,21," No, Was was Closed. Once Was shut down, it reopened as Closed.",6,How I Met Your Mother,63,12
37880,Marshall,21, So Closed is open.,6,How I Met Your Mother,19,4
37881,Robin,21," No, Closed is closed.",6,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
37883,Robin,21," Ew, Third Base is all frat guys.",6,How I Met Your Mother,33,7

37889,Marshall,21," Guys, just pick a club, okay?",6,How I Met Your Mother,30,6
37890,Ted,21, Not Okay!,6,How I Met Your Mother,10,2
37892,Marshall,21," For the record, I was in there once by accident. I'm pretty sure it's pronounced Lamí©.",6,How I Met Your Mother,88,16
37893,Barney,21," It's hopeless, isn't it?",6,How I Met Your Mother,25,4
37896,Marshall,21, Wow. A lot of these girls are young enough to be our daughters.,6,How I Met Your Mother,64,13

37901,Robin,21," No, my secret crush. We met a few years ago.",6,How I Met Your Mother,45,10
37905,Robin,21," Uh... no.  The only good thing about how ugly that shirt is, is that it distracts from how terribly it fits you.",6,How I Met Your Mother,113,22
37907,Robin,21, Oh. ,6,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
37909,Robin,21," I had to leave before we could finish talking, so that was it. You know, ever since then, I've always... Oh, my God, he's coming over here. Oh. Hello.",6,How I Met Your Mother,151,29
37911,Robin,21," Oh, I'm sorry, you must have me confused with the shirt you were wearing that day.",6,How I Met Your Mother,83,16

38105,Marshall,22," Sir, none of that is...",6,How I Met Your Mother,24,5
38111,Barney,22," Invitations for the demolition of The Arcadian. As head of the project, I get to decide how we knock it down. I'm torn between training an actual coyote to use an ACME dynamite plunger, or hooking up a fuse to Eddie Van Halen's guitar that goes off the second he hits the last note to ""Hot For Teacher."" Barney! Barney! Bar... No, no. I'm going to go coyote.",6,How I Met Your Mother,359,68
38112,Robin,22," Wait. While no one wants to see a, uh, coyote wearing a little hard hat more than me, remember",6,How I Met Your Mother,95,19
38113,Barney,22," Oh, come on. Zoey's not shutting anything down, standing out there with her stupid megaphone, screaming in the wind; butt cheeks trembling with fury; her perky breasts heaving; her self-righteous nipples...",6,How I Met Your Mother,207,31
38114,Ted,22," Dude, that's my girlfriend.",6,How I Met Your Mother,28,4
38115,Barney,22," Point is, we are taking her and The Arcadian down. Am I right, Teddy Westside?",6,How I Met Your Mother,79,15
38116,Ted,22, You know it.,6,How I Met Your Mother,13,3
38117,Lily,22," Okay. See, that's so weird to me. One second you're defending Zoey, and the next, you're talking about her going down.",6,How I Met Your Mother,119,21
38118,Barney,22," Glad to know she's also mouthy in a good way. What up? Dude, that's his girlfriend.",6,How I Met Your Mother,84,16
38119,Lily,22, Isn't it tough dating the woman that's trying to prevent your building from being built?,6,How I Met Your Mother,89,15
38120,Ted,22," At first, yes, but we figured out a great way to deal with it",6,How I Met Your Mother,62,14
38121,Lily,22," So, every time The Arcadian comes up, you guys just awkwardly change the subject?",6,How I Met Your Mother,82,14
38122,Ted,22," Yeah, but you'd be surprised. It doesn't even come up that often.",6,How I Met Your Mother,66,12

38134,Barney,22," Not only do you quit the job I stuck my neck out to get you, now you sabotage the project I'm in charge of? Is this because I brushed Lily's boob with my elbow, the other day?",6,How I Met Your Mother,176,37
38135,Lily,22, That was on purpose!,6,How I Met Your Mother,21,4
38136,Barney,22, I mean this is really like...,6,How I Met Your Mother,30,6
38137,Marshall,22," Barney, please...",6,How I Met Your Mother,18,2

38167,Marshall,22," Ah, yes... the sweet, smoky taste of victory.",6,How I Met Your Mother,46,8
38168,Barney,22, Are you sure it doesn't taste like anything else?,6,How I Met Your Mother,50,9
38169,Marshall,22, That's it!,6,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
38171,Barney,22, Kent! Kent!,6,How I Met Your Mother,12,2

38184,Robin,22," Man, what are we going to do without her?",6,How I Met Your Mother,42,9
38185,Lily,22, Oh...,6,How I Met Your Mother,6,1

38187,Lily,22," Yes, but the right kind of drunk. Uh... we should go with something mellow. Maybe red wine?",6,How I Met Your Mother,92,17
38188,Robin,22," Oh, I don't know. Red wine has kind of an odd effect on Barney. He reaches a point of sad clarity.",6,How I Met Your Mother,99,21
38191,Barney,22," I'm a B-plus. My whole life, I was hoping to be an A, and I'm a B-plus. And I'm okay with that.",6,How I Met Your Mother,96,22

38214,Robin,22," It happened, and it changed me. How about daiquiris?",6,How I Met Your Mother,53,9
38215,Lily,22, Maybe. When Marshall has daiquiris... he gets really into how beautiful he is.,6,How I Met Your Mother,79,13
38218,Ted,22," Hey, Marsh, you know that's another mirror, right?",6,How I Met Your Mother,51,8
38220,Lily,22, Peppermint schnapps?,6,How I Met Your Mother,21,2

38232,Lily,22," Oh, wait, Ted. Do you have a specific reaction to any kind of alcohol?",6,How I Met Your Mother,71,14

38236,Ted,22," Peace, I'm out.",6,How I Met Your Mother,16,3
38239,Lily,22," Yeah, Ted, I hate to tell you, but the bourbon only makes it sound good to you.",6,How I Met Your Mother,80,17

38244,Ted,22," You had to take that away from me, didn't you? ",6,How I Met Your Mother,48,10

38246,Ted,22, What do you mean?,6,How I Met Your Mother,18,4
38247,Lily,22, Barney and Marshall's feud got us banned from the bar. We lost our booth.,6,How I Met Your Mother,74,14
38248,Robin,22, Stop.,6,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
38249,Ted,22," Man, how did things get so screwed up?",6,How I Met Your Mother,39,8
38253,Ted,22, You and The Arcadian are ruining my life! What?,6,How I Met Your Mother,48,9
38255,Ted,22," We're talking about this. Look, I can handle you trying to prevent me from fulfilling a life-long dream. That's just being in a relationship. But now? You turn my best friend against me?",6,How I Met Your Mother,187,33
38257,Ted,22," Because he's going through a lot right now. He, he's looking for something to believe in, and you took advantage of that. You're, you're just like those Internet swindlers who tricked him into paying 300 bucks for a lock of Sasquatch fur.",6,How I Met Your Mother,239,42
38259,Ted,22, Okay. You know what? We're settling this once and for all.,6,How I Met Your Mother,59,11
38262,Lily,22, We've cross-referenced every alcohol with Marshall and Barney's reaction. What's the right drink for this situation?,6,How I Met Your Mother,117,16
38263,Robin,22," Well, they're not talking. They're not even looking at each other. That reminds me of those awkward Sunday dinners with my mom, my dad and his mistress. Families, right?",6,How I Met Your Mother,170,29
38264,Lily,22, I-I guess. That... seems like a whole other thing. We need a drink that will start a fight.,6,How I Met Your Mother,92,18
38266,Barney,22, Do you know what I had to do to get you that job?,6,How I Met Your Mother,50,13
38267,Marshall,22, Do you know what I had to do to will myself to show up every day?,6,How I Met Your Mother,66,16
38268,Barney,22," What, wear a wrinkled suit and not give a damn about what your hair looked like?",6,How I Met Your Mother,81,16
38269,Marshall,22, I showed up with wet hair once! Once!,6,How I Met Your Mother,38,8
38270,Barney,22," Oh, my God.",6,How I Met Your Mother,12,3
38272,Ted,22," Well, here we are. I had a reservation at a four-star inn overlooking the ocean but, uh... How can that compete with such a beautiful, magnificent hotel? Welcome to The Arcadian. So here's the deal. If you can last until sunrise in your precious Arcadian, I'll join your side.",6,How I Met Your Mother,277,49
38274,Ted,22, That's not a chocolate.,6,How I Met Your Mother,24,4
38276,Robin,22," Okay, now we need to get them something that will make them emotionally vulnerable and completely, pathetically honest.",6,How I Met Your Mother,120,18
38277,Lily,22," Yeah, we need a drink that, that takes subtext and turns it into text. Yeah.",6,How I Met Your Mother,77,15
38279,Marshall,22," See, ever since the death of my father, I have been drawn to the idea of preservation. That's why The Arcadian speaks to me.",6,How I Met Your Mother,125,24
38280,Barney,22," Ever since my father walked out on my childhood, I've had serious abandonment issues. You walking out on me like that...",6,How I Met Your Mother,121,21
38281,Marshall,22," Oh God, I didn't even think of that...",6,How I Met Your Mother,39,8
38282,Barney,22," It made me wonder, ""What could I have done to make him stay?""",6,How I Met Your Mother,62,13
38283,Marshall,22," Look, you didn't do anything wrong. It wasn't you, Barney.",6,How I Met Your Mother,59,10
38284,Barney,22, That's what everyone keeps saying but people just keep leaving me.,6,How I Met Your Mother,67,11
38285,Robin,22, Wow. That got real o'clock.,6,How I Met Your Mother,28,5
38286,Lily,22, Yeah. We need to get them up and having fun.,6,How I Met Your Mother,45,10
38288,Robin,22," Dance, my puppets, dance!",6,How I Met Your Mother,26,4
38289,Lily,22, Now do you see why I'm always interfering in other people's lives?,6,How I Met Your Mother,67,12
38290,Robin,22," Oh, God, totally!",6,How I Met Your Mother,18,3
38293,Ted,22," Dust just flew out of that comforter in the shape of a skull. Whoa, something just passed through me. Can you get STDs from the ghost of a prostitute?",6,How I Met Your Mother,151,29
38295,Ted,22, What are... What are you doing in our bathroom?,6,How I Met Your Mother,48,9
38298,Lily,22, Okay. Final round. What simple act will get the boys to finally forgive each other?,6,How I Met Your Mother,84,15
38299,Robin,22," Sharing a brandy. Which is what I walked in on my parents doing once. Brandy was my father's mistress. God, parents. Right?",6,How I Met Your Mother,124,22
38300,Lily,22," Again, just a whole other thing, sweetie. Where'd they go? Oh, no. They did shots.",6,How I Met Your Mother,83,15
38301,Robin,22, What? What is it?,6,How I Met Your Mother,18,4
38303,Lily,22, What's the worst thing they could possibly drink right now?,6,How I Met Your Mother,60,10
38307,Barney,22, Your place or mi... Your place or mi... Le-Let's go to your place. Mm.,6,How I Met Your Mother,71,14
38310,Ted,22," Uh, these were supposed to be for a romantic dinner on our balcony as we were serenaded by the sounds of the ocean. But I guess we'll have to settle for what sounded like two very large men having s*x next door... with a third very small man.",6,How I Met Your Mother,243,48
38312,Ted,22," Okay. What is it? And don't give me, ""It's beautiful."" Don't give me, ""It's magnificent"" What is it about this place that makes you so passionate to save it?",6,How I Met Your Mother,158,29
38314,Ted,22," Why, why have you never told me that?",6,How I Met Your Mother,38,8
38317,Ted,22, I love you.,6,How I Met Your Mother,12,3
38321,Robin,22," Well, what drink finally did the trick?",6,How I Met Your Mother,40,7
38324,Marshall,22, I love you.,6,How I Met Your Mother,12,3
38325,Barney,22, I love you.,6,How I Met Your Mother,12,3
38327,Barney,22," Uh, no. N-Not right...",6,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
38329,Ted,22," You know, I guess this place isn't so bad.",6,How I Met Your Mother,43,9
38331,Ted,22, What was what?,6,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
38333,Ted,22, I don't see anything.,6,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
38335,Ted,22," Oh, my God! It's the cock-a-mouse!",6,How I Met Your Mother,35,6
38337,Ted,22," Cock-a-mouse. Part cockroach, part mouse. It used to live in our apartment. It must have settled here, and... Oh! Look, it had babies! Good for it.",6,How I Met Your Mother,148,26
38340,Lily,22," Be well, my friends! Aw, just how we left them.",6,How I Met Your Mother,48,10
38341,Robin,22, Morning. Who wants breakfast?,6,How I Met Your Mother,30,4
38342,Barney,22, You have some coffee? So I can throw it in this traitor's face?,6,How I Met Your Mother,64,13
38343,Marshall,22," Oh, yeah? Hey! Hey! Do you guys have some pancakes, because I... would really like some pancakes. They're fantastic. Let's be honest, I love them. But I hate this guy!",6,How I Met Your Mother,168,30
38344,Lily,22, I thought they made up last night.,6,How I Met Your Mother,35,7
38345,Robin,22," Damn it, I know what happened.",6,How I Met Your Mother,31,6
38347,Marshall,22, I love you.,6,How I Met Your Mother,12,3
38348,Barney,22," I love you. Uh, no. N-not right...",6,How I Met Your Mother,35,7
38349,Lily,22," Carl, a round of champagne.",6,How I Met Your Mother,28,5
38351,Lily,22, Ooh! The champagne.,6,How I Met Your Mother,20,3
38352,Robin,22, We gave them one drink too many. They must've blacked out and forgotten the whole thing.,6,How I Met Your Mother,89,16
38353,Barney,22," What kind of dirtbag doesn't stand by his best friends, but instead sides with some self-righteous bitch with a pointless cause and a megaphone?",6,How I Met Your Mother,145,24
38355,Ted,22," Dude. That's my girlfriend. And you know what? I'm on her side now, too.",6,How I Met Your Mother,73,14
38356,Barney,22," Whoa, whoa, you have got to be kidding me. Ted...",6,How I Met Your Mother,50,10
38357,Robin,22," Okay, what drink can fix this?",6,How I Met Your Mother,31,6
38358,Lily,22, Mama's done with this drama. What drink can fix the headache these clowns are giving me?,6,How I Met Your Mother,89,16
38359,Robin,22, I got it.,6,How I Met Your Mother,10,3
38362,Robin,22, Right?,6,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
38363,Lily,22, Time is music the planets make. Music the planets make...,6,How I Met Your Mother,58,10
38370,Marshall,23," A symbol of strength and constancy, the stone lion of The Arcadian has watched over New Yorkers for generations. So remember",6,How I Met Your Mother,125,21
38372,Marshall,23, I just have...,6,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
38374,Marshall,23, Wrecking ball. Don't go swinging no wrecking ball.,6,How I Met Your Mother,51,8
38376,Marshall,23, Thank you.,6,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
38381,Ted,23," ""Yes. The Arcadian should be a landmark."" And then the crowd gasps",6,How I Met Your Mother,67,12
38383,Ted,23, Almost exclusively. But here's my point,6,How I Met Your Mother,40,6
38385,Marshall,23," I'm sorry, I should have been more clear.",6,How I Met Your Mother,42,8
38387,Marshall,23, Nice.,6,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
38388,Robin,23, I have a message from Barney.,6,How I Met Your Mother,30,6
38393,Ted,23," Dude! That's my girlfriend. And ya know what? I'm on her side now, too.",6,How I Met Your Mother,72,14
38396,Ted,23," Mmm. Love you, too.",6,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
38397,Lily,23," All right, what's the message? 'Cause if it's another hypothetical yet eerily accurate drawing of my boobs...",6,How I Met Your Mother,110,17
38398,Robin,23," Yeah, I have that, too.",6,How I Met Your Mother,24,5
38399,Lily,23, Damn it.,6,How I Met Your Mother,9,2
38400,Robin,23," All right, here's the message.  ""Oh, hey, guys. Didn't see you there. I was too busy feelin' fine and..."" Really? ""Feelin' fine and gettin' some 'jine. You may have noticed the giant plate of hot wings in front of me. I know how much you love hot wings. Too bad someone bribed the kitchen to take them off the menu tonight. So, if you want some, you're going to have to come back to GNB. But hurry, this offer will be gone lickety-split.  Do evil laugh."" Oh, um...  So, what are you turds up to?",6,How I Met Your Mother,496,95
38401,Marshall,23," Oh, we've got the big LPC meeting in two days. I have my whole presentation worked out. I just need to find a good rhyme to end on.",6,How I Met Your Mother,132,28
38402,Ted,23, Why does it need to rhyme?,6,How I Met Your Mother,27,6
38403,Marshall,23," If you end an argument with a rhyme, it's convincing all the time.",6,How I Met Your Mother,67,13
38404,Lily,23, Yeah. It's why in our apartment,6,How I Met Your Mother,32,6
38405,Marshall,23, And she hasn't since.,6,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
38406,Barney,23," Okay, okay. A couple of things. Lily, how'd I do?",6,How I Met Your Mother,50,10
38407,Marshall,23, Nailed it.,6,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
38408,Barney,23," Secondly, Ted, I'm sorry I said mean things about Zoey. Are you really going to walk away from this project just because you're mad at me?",6,How I Met Your Mother,139,26
38409,Ted,23," It's not because I'm mad at you. Barney, The Arcadian was designed by a guy named John Clifford Larrabee. And even though he's been dead for half a century, it's my duty, architect to architect, to keep his work alive. Please tell me a little part of you understands.",6,How I Met Your Mother,268,49
38410,Barney,23, I understand. Zoey has magic lady bits.,6,How I Met Your Mother,40,7
38411,Ted,23, What?,6,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
38412,Barney,23," Zoey's lady bits... are magic, and that's how she controls your mind. You see, every few hundred millennia, lady bits leap forward...",6,How I Met Your Mother,134,22
38413,Lily,23," I know you're only just getting started, but this is already gross.",6,How I Met Your Mother,68,12
38414,Barney,23, I once knew such a girl.,6,How I Met Your Mother,25,6
38416,Barney,23, It was last call. In this very bar.,6,How I Met Your Mother,36,8
38418,Barney,23, What...?! No... What?!...No... What?!,6,How I Met Your Mother,38,4
38420,Robin,23," Um... thank you for, um, not using a first name in that story.",6,How I Met Your Mother,63,13
38421,Ted,23," Barney, this is about the building.",6,How I Met Your Mother,36,6
38422,Barney,23, Come on. This is so about the girl.,6,How I Met Your Mother,36,8
38423,Ted,23," Okay, fine. It's about the girl! I am doing this for Zoey! I'm in love with her. Look, I know it's early, but there is a very good chance Zoey might be the mother of my children. So, in addition to doing this for John Clifford Larrabee, I'm also doing this for Luke and Leia.",6,How I Met Your Mother,276,55
38424,Lily,23, Wait. She's gonna let you name your kids Luke and Leia?,6,How I Met Your Mother,56,11
38425,Ted,23," Not if I knock down her favorite building, she isn't. Barney, I'm sorry.",6,How I Met Your Mother,73,13
38426,Barney,23," Oh, you're not sorry now, Ted Mosby. But you will be. You... will... be.  That's how you do an evil laugh. Ciao for now.",6,How I Met Your Mother,121,24
38429,Barney,23," Hi, Arthur. Everything okay?",6,How I Met Your Mother,29,4
38431,Barney,23, Isn't that animal cruelty?,6,How I Met Your Mother,27,4
38433,Barney,23," Oh. That's fine, then. So listen, you know Ted, the architect?",6,How I Met Your Mother,63,11
38435,Barney,23," So, if Ted stood up at that big meeting tomorrow and said that he thought The Arcadian should be a landmark... You wouldn't just fire him, would you?  Right? You wouldn't just... You wouldn't just... yeah...",6,How I Met Your Mother,208,36
38437,Barney,23, Come again for Big Fudge?,6,How I Met Your Mother,26,5
38439,Barney,23," Can you believe that?! I can't be unemployed, Robin! My job is my identity; It's who I am. It gives me the confidence I need to convince girls I'm a fighter pilot.",6,How I Met Your Mother,164,32
38440,Robin,23, I-I don't understand. Why would he fire you?,6,How I Met Your Mother,45,8
38443,Barney,23, I don't understand. Why would you fire me?,6,How I Met Your Mother,43,8
38445,Barney,23, By being the best architect available?,6,How I Met Your Mother,39,6
38447,Barney,23, By... being Latino?,6,How I Met Your Mother,20,3
38450,Barney,23," Guys, I'm telling you, if Ted Mosby isn't fantastic, fire me.",6,How I Met Your Mother,62,11
38452,Barney,23, Damn it! I was kidding?,6,How I Met Your Mother,24,5
38454,Barney,23," I'm not kidding! Oh, by the way, Arthur, uh, how are things with you and your wife?",6,How I Met Your Mother,84,17
38461,Ted,23, They're going to fire him? That sucks. He loves that job.,6,How I Met Your Mother,58,11
38462,Marshall,23, And he's been doing it for years.,6,How I Met Your Mother,34,7
38463,Lily,23," Okay, what does Barney do at GNB?",6,How I Met Your Mother,34,7
38464,Ted,23, No idea.,6,How I Met Your Mother,9,2
38465,Marshall,23, He has a lot of keys.,6,How I Met Your Mother,22,6
38466,Robin,23," Okay, Ted, can you just please think about this before you...",6,How I Met Your Mother,62,11
38467,Ted,23, There's nothing to think about. I-I can't lose Zoey. That's the only thing that matters to me right now.,6,How I Met Your Mother,105,19
38468,Robin,23," Okay, Ted... you know I love Zoey. But, look, sometimes... I go play chess in the park. And the key to chess... Okay, I play online. But the key to chess... Okay, it's Angry Birds! But the key to Angry Birds is to always try to see every possible outcome. And to... hit some pigs with rocks or something. I don't know; I don't play. I can't get it to download. The point is, this thing with you and Zoey? I can see it going three possible ways. There's the first scenario.",6,How I Met Your Mother,473,92
38470,Robin,23, The chairman asks you...,6,How I Met Your Mother,25,4
38472,Robin,23, You say...,6,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
38473,Ted,23, No.,6,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
38474,Robin,23, And Zoey dumps you on the spot.,6,How I Met Your Mother,32,7
38477,Robin,23, There's the second scenario.,6,How I Met Your Mother,29,4
38479,Robin,23, The chairman asks you...,6,How I Met Your Mother,25,4
38481,Robin,23, You say...,6,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
38482,Ted,23, Yes,6,How I Met Your Mother,4,1
38483,Robin,23," And you're happy for, like, a second, until you realize the building you helped save has just become a monument to everything this woman made you give up, and you resent her for it, so much so, in fact, that you dump her.",6,How I Met Your Mother,222,43
38484,Ted,23, We're done here.,6,How I Met Your Mother,17,3
38486,Ted,23, You said there was a third scenario.,6,How I Met Your Mother,37,7
38487,Robin,23, Right.,6,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
38489,Robin,23, The chairman asks you...,6,How I Met Your Mother,25,4
38491,Robin,23, But before you can answer...You're hit in the neck with a blow dart fired by the ninja Zoey's ex-husband hired to assassinate you.,6,How I Met Your Mother,131,23
38493,Robin,23, That one's less likely. What I'm saying... what I hate saying... is this. You and Zoey are gonna break up. But you can still save your career and Barney's.,6,How I Met Your Mother,156,29
38494,Ted,23," Okay, first of all, no ninja's getting a jump on me. I have the reflexes of a jungle... ",6,How I Met Your Mother,89,18
38495,Lily,23, Tree?,6,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
38496,Ted,23," Second of all, I don't care that the odds are stacked against us. I'd rather try to make this work with Zoey than spend the rest of my life alone playing Angry Birds, which, by the way, I've shown you how to download, like, 20 times.",6,How I Met Your Mother,234,46
38497,Lily,23," I've got to say, I'm with Ted on this.",6,How I Met Your Mother,39,9
38498,Ted,23, Thank you.,6,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
38499,Lily,23," I mean, yes, this is a huge, divisive issue for them. Which means no matter what happens, there's gonna be a lot of resentment. Probably lasting for years... infecting every single moment of the rest of their relationship. So, in conclusion, I'm with Robin on this.",6,How I Met Your Mother,266,46
38500,Robin,23, Thank you.,6,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
38505,Ted,23," Barney, what are you doing?",6,How I Met Your Mother,28,5
38507,Ted,23, Really? 'Cause it feels more like my insane friend renting a costume and breaking into my apartment in the middle of the night for what I wish I could say was the first time.,6,How I Met Your Mother,175,34
38509,Ted,23," Barney, there's condoms in the drawer. Just take them and get out.",6,How I Met Your Mother,67,12
38512,Ted,23, Whoa! Lighting change!,6,How I Met Your Mother,23,3
38514,Ted,23," Okay, yes, it's-it's a terrible building, but... does that mean we have to knock it down? I mean, it's not bothering anyone. Just anyone who lives in it... Or looks at it... Or smells it.",6,How I Met Your Mother,188,35
38516,Ted,23," The Arcadian has to go, doesn't it?",6,How I Met Your Mother,36,7
38518,Ted,23, You realize this kind of screws up my personal life.,6,How I Met Your Mother,53,10
38520,Ted,23," This is a dream, right? Because, Barney, I swear to God, if that's you...",6,How I Met Your Mother,74,14
38526,Ted,23," ""Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair""""",6,How I Met Your Mother,44,8
38528,Ted,23, Right. And I mistook you for a prostitute right... here.,6,How I Met Your Mother,57,10
38530,Ted,23, Worth every penny.,6,How I Met Your Mother,19,3
38532,Ted,23," No, we should get some sleep. But this was fun.",6,How I Met Your Mother,48,10
38534,Ted,23, Exactly.,6,How I Met Your Mother,9,1
38536,Ted,23, Yeah. Good night.,6,How I Met Your Mother,18,3
38539,Ted,23," No, it shouldn't be a landmark. There are a lot of important buildings in New York. The Arcadian isn't one of them.",6,How I Met Your Mother,116,22
38543,Ted,23," Yeah, that's me.",6,How I Met Your Mother,17,3
38545,Ted,23," This is a nightmare. I can't believe she kept that tape. The LPC's gonna come back with a decision tomorrow, and based on today...",6,How I Met Your Mother,131,24
38546,Robin,23, They're gonna landmark the hell out of that place.,6,How I Met Your Mother,51,9
38547,Ted,23, Yeah.,6,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
38548,Barney,23," We'll end up out of a job, all thanks to some stupid, only sort of awesome lion head.",6,How I Met Your Mother,86,18
38549,Marshall,23," Better get used to that lion head. As of tomorrow, it's gonna be there till the end of times. And all because of my sweet, sweet rhymes.",6,How I Met Your Mother,137,27
38550,Ted,23, What are we gonna do? We should buy a bar.,6,How I Met Your Mother,43,10
38551,Barney,23, We should totally buy a bar!,6,How I Met Your Mother,29,6
38552,Marshall,23, We should absolutely totally buy a bar!,6,How I Met Your Mother,40,7
38553,Robin,23, It's really the only sensible idea right now.,6,How I Met Your Mother,46,8
38554,Marshall,23," Oh, oh, and ready? It's a theme bar. It's a courtroom.",6,How I Met Your Mother,55,11
38555,Ted,23, Yes! Where the bartenders wear sexy judges' robes.,6,How I Met Your Mother,51,8
38556,Marshall,23, I'll allow it!,6,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
38557,Barney,23," The only court where you show up, then get served.",6,How I Met Your Mother,51,10
38558,Robin,23, Ho! You're judged by a jury of your beers.,6,How I Met Your Mother,43,9
38559,Ted,23, That's not bad.,6,How I Met Your Mother,16,3
38560,Lily,23, Just stop it! No one's buying a bar. Right now we have a little problem. Let's just think of a solution.,6,How I Met Your Mother,105,21
38561,Ted,23," Lily, it's over. The good guys lost.",6,How I Met Your Mother,37,7
38562,Marshall,23," I don't know, homegirl is pretty diabolical. If there is a plan that'll get us out of this, it's somewhere inside this butter churn. She'll think of it. I'm just gonna sit here... and watch it happen.  And she's got it! Lily, what's the plan?",6,How I Met Your Mother,243,45
38563,Barney,23," Oh, this ought to be good.",6,How I Met Your Mother,27,6
38565,Barney,23," Oh, this is good!",6,How I Met Your Mother,18,4
38566,Ted,23, We have to find Arthur right now.,6,How I Met Your Mother,34,7
38569,Barney,23," Hey, Arthur!",6,How I Met Your Mother,13,2
38570,Robin,23," Oh, cute dog!",6,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
38572,Barney,23," Listen, Arthur, Marshall's wife has an idea for how we can save, not saving The Arcadian.",6,How I Met Your Mother,90,16
38574,Barney,23," Uh... Hey, Arthur?",6,How I Met Your Mother,19,3
38576,Lily,23," Okay, first hear my demands. One, Ted and Barney keep their jobs. Two, when you guys do finally blow up The Arcadian, one of them gets to push the button.",6,How I Met Your Mother,155,30
38579,Lily,23, Well...,6,How I Met Your Mother,8,1
38584,Ted,23, Zoey... Zoey!,6,How I Met Your Mother,14,2
38586,Ted,23, I don't know. Sometimes... things have to fall apart to make way for better things.,6,How I Met Your Mother,84,15
38590,Ted,23," Okay, you don't have to hold back anymore. You may now say what you really think of Zoey.",6,How I Met Your Mother,90,18
38591,Barney,23," I don't know, she may have been right about that lion's head. It gave The Arcadian a regal elegance. Then again, it goes really nice with my duvet.  I hope I used the right screws.",6,How I Met Your Mother,181,35
38594,Ted,24, I want to press the button to blow up The Arcadian!,6,How I Met Your Mother,52,11
38595,Barney,24, I want to press it!,6,How I Met Your Mother,20,5
38596,Ted,24, I want to press it!,6,How I Met Your Mother,20,5
38597,Barney,24, I want to press it!,6,How I Met Your Mother,20,5
38598,Robin,24," Guys, I dated you both, and neither of you is good at pressing or even finding the button. After some awkward pawing around, that building's going to fake an implosion, say, ""Baby, that was great"""" and go to sleep.",6,How I Met Your Mother,215,39
38600,Robin,24," It's just a button, okay? Can we just talk about something else, please?",6,How I Met Your Mother,73,13
38601,Ted,24," Well, I ran into Zoey yesterday.",6,How I Met Your Mother,33,6
38602,Robin,24, That's the first time since the breakup. How's she doing?,6,How I Met Your Mother,58,10
38605,Ted,24, Saving money. Making new friends. No downside.,6,How I Met Your Mother,47,7
38607,Ted,24," Well, I can tell you're really busy so I should... I'll let you go.",6,How I Met Your Mother,68,14
38610,Robin,24," You know that ""coffee"" is code for ""I want to get back together"" right?",6,How I Met Your Mother,72,14
38611,Ted,24," Well, at first I wasn't sure, but then she said something that got me thinking.",6,How I Met Your Mother,80,15
38615,Ted,24," Don't worry, we're not. I just, I feel bad Zoey's having such a hard time.",6,How I Met Your Mother,75,15
38616,Barney,24," You know what might... make you feel better, buddy?",6,How I Met Your Mother,52,9
38617,Ted,24, I'm not letting you press the button.,6,How I Met Your Mother,38,7
38618,Barney,24, I want to press the button!,6,How I Met Your Mother,28,6
38619,Ted,24, You're not pressing the button! It's my button!,6,How I Met Your Mother,48,8
38623,Lily,24," He's out printing out a whole new batch of rí©sumí©s because he misspelled the phrase ""detail-oriented."" And when he gets back home, he is going to find his favorite soup there waiting for him.",6,How I Met Your Mother,194,34
38624,Robin,24," Oh, that's sweet, Lil, but didn't you guys get food poisoning here one time?",6,How I Met Your Mother,77,14
38625,Lily,24," Three times. But they're really nice about it. Their policy is, ""Get sick, get a free gallon of soup"".",6,How I Met Your Mother,103,19
38628,Lily,24," This is Mr. Buttons 2. Now, after what happened to Mr. Buttons 1, we have to be very gentle with...  Marshall! Don't eat the soup! Oh, thank God.",6,How I Met Your Mother,146,28
38629,Marshall,24, This was about to be my third bowl. Why shouldn't I eat the soup? Why shouldn't I eat the soup?,6,How I Met Your Mother,96,20
38632,Robin,24," Hey, Mr. Architect, big day for you tomorrow, huh?",6,How I Met Your Mother,51,9
38633,Barney,24, Yeah. Getting to stand next to me while I press the button. That is going to be legend... wait for it...dary adjacent. Legendary adjacent!,6,How I Met Your Mother,139,24
38634,Robin,24, You okay?,6,How I Met Your Mother,10,2
38635,Ted,24, Yeah... no. This morning I was talking to the foreman.,6,How I Met Your Mother,55,10
38638,Ted,24," You know, Rod, um, I'm loving that nickname, and I can tell it's totally affectionate, but, uh, I'd prefer Ted.",6,How I Met Your Mother,112,20
38641,Ted,24," 50,000 lightbulbs! What if this one's too bright? What if this one flickers and gives everyone a weird headache? Do you know how many people it takes to change 50,000 lightbulbs?",6,How I Met Your Mother,179,31
38642,Barney,24," Are these people Irish, Polish, blondes... what are we dealing with here?",6,How I Met Your Mother,74,12
38643,Ted,24, There's just-- there's so many decisions to be made. What if I make all the wrong ones and my building just sucks?,6,How I Met Your Mother,115,22
38644,Barney,24, Not possible. Your building is new. And I have one rule,6,How I Met Your Mother,56,11
38645,Ted,24, You can't keep saying you have one rule if they're always different rules.,6,How I Met Your Mother,75,13
38646,Barney,24," Ah, but ""new is always better"" is my oldest rule, which makes it the best.",6,How I Met Your Mother,75,15
38648,Ted,24," Hi, Marsh.",6,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
38649,Barney,24," Oh, hey, buddy.",6,How I Met Your Mother,16,3
38650,Robin,24, Hey. Everything okay?,6,How I Met Your Mother,22,3
38651,Marshall,24," Lily got food poisoning from some soup. And then I ate the soup exactly three hours later. Which means I can see exactly three hours into my future, and it... doesn't... look... good. I tried to be supportive.",6,How I Met Your Mother,210,38
38654,Lily,24," Oh, baby, can you just hold me, please?",6,How I Met Your Mother,40,8
38655,Marshall,24," Of course, baby. ",6,How I Met Your Mother,18,3
38657,Marshall,24," But it doesn't help it that when Lily gets going; she sounds like a velociraptor from Jurassic Park. But then I realized a man can do a lot of living in three hours. So, I'm out experiencing this beautiful, crazy dance called life. Ah, my last meal. MacClaren's famous jalapeno poppers. My doctor says I need to eat healthier, so I figured the round-trip flight these babies are about to take will land them permanently on the no-fry list. Good-bye, my friend. It's been a hell of a ride. I have to...",6,How I Met Your Mother,502,92
38659,Marshall,24," Hey, babe. The gang says feel better.",6,How I Met Your Mother,38,7
38660,Lily,24," Mm. Thanks. Wait, you didn't tell them I had food poisoning, did you?",6,How I Met Your Mother,70,13
38661,Marshall,24," Um, I...",6,How I Met Your Mother,9,2
38662,Lily,24," Marshall, when it's stomach stuff, you just say ""under the weather,"" or people start picturing you doing unspeakable things.",6,How I Met Your Mother,125,19
38663,Marshall,24, I know. I just said that you had the sniffles. No one is picturing anything but little red-nosed you under a blankie with some hot tea.,6,How I Met Your Mother,136,26
38665,Barney,24, I wonder what end it's coming out of Lily right now.,6,How I Met Your Mother,53,11
38666,Robin,24, I bet it's her tushie.,6,How I Met Your Mother,23,5
38667,Barney,24," I bet it's both. Hey, speaking of explosions... enough already, Ted! That button's mine!",6,How I Met Your Mother,89,14
38669,Barney,24," I got you this job, so I... Say what?",6,How I Met Your Mother,38,9
38670,Ted,24, Whatever. It's yours. I gotta run. ,6,How I Met Your Mother,36,6
38671,Barney,24, You...,6,How I Met Your Mother,7,1
38675,Robin,24," Why would Ted just give up the button like that? And he forgot his phone. ""See you in an hour.""",6,How I Met Your Mother,96,20
38676,Barney,24, Who's that from?,6,How I Met Your Mother,17,3
38677,Robin,24, Zoey. They're meeting for coffee. Ted's getting back together with her!,6,How I Met Your Mother,72,11
38679,Barney,24, Why would Ted get back together with Zoey? He's doing great.,6,How I Met Your Mother,61,11
38680,Robin,24," After a breakup, we all think we're doing great. Sometimes the tiniest trigger can unravel you and send you crawling right back.",6,How I Met Your Mother,129,22
38681,Barney,24," No, I refuse to believe that Ted is getting back with Zoey because of lightbulbs.",6,How I Met Your Mother,82,15
38682,Robin,24," Uh, Ted's gone back for less.",6,How I Met Your Mother,30,6
38685,Ted,24," Hi, Natalie. You want to get coffee sometime?",6,How I Met Your Mother,46,8
38688,Ted,24, Bro.,6,How I Met Your Mother,5,1
38689,Barney,24," Ted, I only have one rule.",6,How I Met Your Mother,27,6
38690,Ted,24," But I can't reach the worst part.  Hi, Karen. Want to get coffee sometime?",6,How I Met Your Mother,75,14
38696,Ted,24," Robin, you want to get coffee sometime...?",6,How I Met Your Mother,43,7
38697,Robin,24," Get it together, bro.",6,How I Met Your Mother,22,4
38700,Marshall,24," According to my calculations, at 6",6,How I Met Your Mother,35,6
38701,Lily,24," Oh, but, baby, what if you hit the jackpot early?",6,How I Met Your Mother,50,10
38702,Marshall,24, Don't worry. I'll be prepared.,6,How I Met Your Mother,31,5
38705,Marshall,24, Can... I... borrow... an adult diaper?,6,How I Met Your Mother,39,6
38707,Barney,24, We've got to stop Ted. Where are they meeting?,6,How I Met Your Mother,47,9
38708,Robin,24," Okay, Zoey wrote, ""Meet me at 6",6,How I Met Your Mother,32,7
38709,Barney,24," Well, that's good. All we have to do is think back to the time Ted told us about his first date with Zoey.",6,How I Met Your Mother,107,23
38711,Ted,24, Amazing first date with Zoey! We met at the intersection... ,6,How I Met Your Mother,61,10
38712,Robin,24," Aw, that's sweet.",6,How I Met Your Mother,18,3
38714,Barney,24, You weren't listening either?,6,How I Met Your Mother,30,4
38715,Robin,24," I was in a coma. I mean, who pays attention to that sappy romantic crap?",6,How I Met Your Mother,73,15
38718,Lily,24," Yeah, I wasn't listening, either. Ted really can go on about a bitch.",6,How I Met Your Mother,70,13
38719,Robin,24, Great. He could be anywhere. We're flat out of clues.,6,How I Met Your Mother,54,10
38720,Lily,24," Hey, wait. Ted left a message. I could hear it 'cause I was in the bathroom... blowing my nose... I have the sniffles.",6,How I Met Your Mother,119,23
38723,Lily,24," Damn it, Marshall.",6,How I Met Your Mother,19,3
38725,Robin,24," Okay, we're never gonna find him.",6,How I Met Your Mother,34,6
38726,Lily,24," Wait, wait, wait. That's was a subway announcement in the background. I speak conductor.",6,How I Met Your Mother,89,14
38729,Lily,24, Got it. Ted's at...  Oh... Ted's at Smith and Ninth Street.,6,How I Met Your Mother,60,11
38730,Barney,24, That's the intersection.,6,How I Met Your Mother,25,3
38731,Robin,24, That's in Brooklyn. How are we ever gonna get there in time?,6,How I Met Your Mother,61,12
38732,Barney,24, Way ahead of ya.,6,How I Met Your Mother,17,4
38738,Marshall,24," Hello, hi.",6,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
38741,Robin,24, I can't believe Ted's getting back together with Zoey.,6,How I Met Your Mother,55,9
38742,Barney,24, I know. They're a total train wreck.,6,How I Met Your Mother,37,7
38743,Robin,24, Unmitigated disaster.,6,How I Met Your Mother,22,2
38745,Barney,24," Yeah, almost as bad as us.",6,How I Met Your Mother,27,6
38746,Robin,24," We were a mess. Do you remember how awful I looked by the end? My hair was falling out, my skin was gray, my back was hunched.",6,How I Met Your Mother,127,27
38747,Barney,24," What about me? I got so fat, at the end of a date, you'd unhook my bra.",6,How I Met Your Mother,72,17
38748,Robin,24, You were the only boyfriend I ever motorboated.,6,How I Met Your Mother,48,8
38749,Barney,24," Thank God we're not sentimental saps who panic and get back together. Seriously, why would people do that?",6,How I Met Your Mother,107,18
38750,Robin,24, I guess I get it.,6,How I Met Your Mother,18,5
38751,Barney,24, What do you mean?,6,How I Met Your Mother,18,4
38752,Robin,24," Well, no matter how bad things got... Ted really did love Zoey for a minute there. Didn't he?",6,How I Met Your Mother,94,18
38753,Barney,24," Yeah... he did. And... she loved him, too. Didn't she?",6,How I Met Your Mother,55,10
38754,Robin,24," Yeah, she did.",6,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
38758,Marshall,24, That's a seal.,6,How I Met Your Mother,15,3
38760,Marshall,24, Mm-hmm.,6,How I Met Your Mother,8,1
38763,Robin,24," Okay, where the hell are they?",6,How I Met Your Mother,31,6
38764,Barney,24, Maybe this isn't the intersection.,6,How I Met Your Mother,35,5
38765,Robin,24," Well, maybe it is and we're too late. Man, I wish we'd gone to Brooklyn sooner.",6,How I Met Your Mother,80,16
38767,Robin,24, Wait. Where'd you get that? ,6,How I Met Your Mother,29,5
38770,Barney,24, She's alone! There's still time! But where the hell is Ted?,6,How I Met Your Mother,60,11
38771,Robin,24," Wait a minute. On their first date, he brought her an orchid. How much do you want to bet he's gonna do it again?",6,How I Met Your Mother,114,24
38772,Barney,24," Brilliant. But wait, he had a huge head start on us. There's no way he's still in there unless he spent a half an hour picking out the perfect orchid.",6,How I Met Your Mother,151,30
38776,Marshall,24, A pile of rotting seagull carcasses covered in toxic sludge.,6,How I Met Your Mother,61,10
38782,Lily,24," When it's stomach stuff, you just say ""under the weather"" or people start picturing you doing unspeakable things.",6,How I Met Your Mother,114,18
38783,Marshall,24, I have food poisoning and I'm about to start volcanoing toxic sludge out of both ends! ,6,How I Met Your Mother,88,16
38784,Lily,24, Nailed it.,6,How I Met Your Mother,11,2
38786,Ted,24," Thanks, Julia! No, on second thought. Ooh! Come on. What the hell?!",6,How I Met Your Mother,68,12
38787,Robin,24, You can't get back together with Zoey just because you're freaking out over a lightbulb.,6,How I Met Your Mother,89,15
38788,Ted,24," I'm not freaking out over a lightbulb! I'm freaking out over 50,000 lightbulbs! I can't do this! I only got this job because you gave it to me, Barney. I didn't earn it!",6,How I Met Your Mother,170,33
38789,Robin,24," Look, Ted, the future is scary. But you can't just run back to the past because it's familiar. Yes, it's tempting.",6,How I Met Your Mother,115,21
38790,Barney,24, But... it's a mistake.,6,How I Met Your Mother,23,4
38791,Ted,24," You're right.  Um, excuse me. Can you give this to the blonde sitting alone in there and tell her Ted's really sorry? Also... indirect sunlight. Don't overwater. Half a cup a week is more than enough.  No. Hi.",6,How I Met Your Mother,210,38
38794,Lily,24," Hey, baby, how'd it go?",6,How I Met Your Mother,24,5
38795,Marshall,24," Lily, this year, this nasty schoolyard bully of a year will not stop punching me in the face. How did we kick off 2011? My dad died. And now after five months of unemployment, I just blew my dream job. The good news is, in a few seconds, I'm gonna start heaving my guts out because that's what life is for me now",6,How I Met Your Mother,313,63
38796,Lily,24," Baby, come here.",6,How I Met Your Mother,17,3
38797,Marshall,24, I just want to shut my eyes for a few seconds before it starts. ,6,How I Met Your Mother,65,14
38801,Barney,24, He is.,6,How I Met Your Mother,7,2
38802,Ted,24, You sure?,6,How I Met Your Mother,10,2
38803,Barney,24, Yeah. You earned it.,6,How I Met Your Mother,21,4
38805,Ted,24," Hey, new is always better, right?",6,How I Met Your Mother,34,6
38806,Barney,24, Always.,6,How I Met Your Mother,8,1
38809,Marshall,24," Lily, it's a miracle. I didn't get sick. I didn't get sick.",6,How I Met Your Mother,60,12
38810,Lily,24," I know, baby. I'm pregnant.",6,How I Met Your Mother,28,5
38814,Robin,24, I'm proud of you for giving Ted the button. It meant a lot.,6,How I Met Your Mother,60,13
38815,Barney,24," It's just a button. Can we talk about something else, please?  Norah.",6,How I Met Your Mother,70,12
38817,Barney,24, How you been?,6,How I Met Your Mother,14,3
38819,Barney,24," Look, I don't know why you would possibly say yes to this, but would you want to grab a cup of coffee with me sometime? 20 minutes. I was such a jerk to you. You can spend the entire time calling me every dirty name in the book.",6,How I Met Your Mother,229,48
38821,Barney,24," I'll call you. You look beautiful, by the way. And here I thought it was too late for sundresses.",6,How I Met Your Mother,98,19
38823,Barney,24, Challenge accepted.,6,How I Met Your Mother,20,2
38827,Lily,24, Best man? You're being summoned.,6,How I Met Your Mother,33,5
38828,Ted,24," Geez, what now?  I heard the groom needed me.",6,How I Met Your Mother,46,9
38830,Barney,24, What do you think of this tie?,6,How I Met Your Mother,31,7
38831,Ted,1," Children, if there is a major theme in this story, and I swear, it's almost, really, not quite at the end of the story.This is timing. The timing makes all the difference. For example, I never met your mother if it was not for a wedding.The last of the weddings that I thought would be.",7,How I Met Your Mother,287,55
38833,Barney,1, What do you think of this tie?,7,How I Met Your Mother,31,7
38834,Ted,1," Thank you, God. Barney Stinson needs you just before her marriage, is that there must be a dead prostitute in the closet, right?",7,How I Met Your Mother,129,23
38835,Barney,1, This one is better?,7,How I Met Your Mother,20,4
38836,Ted,1," The tie is well, and you know, this is perfectly normal pinball shortly before his marriage.",7,How I Met Your Mother,93,16
38837,Barney,1," I'm not scared. It's just that I think once I'd put this tie, I could never remove it. I should wear it again and again. And of course this tie is fine now, but how I will cope when it becomes big and it annoy me? Do I made a mistake? Is what I would have been happier with the other tie? Ted, I can tell you a big secret?",7,How I Met Your Mother,323,70
38838,Ted,1," Yeah, sure.",7,How I Met Your Mother,12,2
38839,Barney,1, I do not really talk about the tie.,7,How I Met Your Mother,36,8
38840,Ted,1," Yeah, I realized that Barney.",7,How I Met Your Mother,30,5
38841,Barney,1, I wonder if this will be a disaster. And if it was the worst of all marriage?,7,How I Met Your Mother,78,17
38842,Ted,1, Impossible. It has already been the worst of all marriage.,7,How I Met Your Mother,59,10
38843,Barney,1, That of Punchy.,7,How I Met Your Mother,16,3
38844,Ted,1, Marshall has really ruined all that.,7,How I Met Your Mother,37,6
38845,Ted,1, The story of Uncle Marshall has ruined everything in my friend's wedding Punchy starts in September 2011.,7,How I Met Your Mother,106,17
38847,Ted,1, Punchy asked me to be his witness.,7,How I Met Your Mother,35,7
38849,Ted,1, Hi. Guys before you go that you bother to read my toast for the wedding?,7,How I Met Your Mother,73,15
38850,Barney,1," Yeah, no problem, of course.",7,How I Met Your Mother,29,5
38851,Ted,1, Ok,7,How I Met Your Mother,3,1
38853,Barney,1, Woow.,7,How I Met Your Mother,6,1
38854,Ted,1, There are several different versions.,7,How I Met Your Mother,38,5
38855,Robin,1," Ted, why you work so hard on this speech? Punchy has applied with a karaoke microphone in a bowling alley.",7,How I Met Your Mother,107,20
38856,Ted,1," Ok, I have never said that, but over the years, some of my friends from high school asked me to give speeches at their weddings, and they have not gone well.",7,How I Met Your Mother,158,31
