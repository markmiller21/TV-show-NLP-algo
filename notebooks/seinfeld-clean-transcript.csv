1358,George,6," Please, it doesn't look good. Boy, boy, girl.",2,Seinfeld,46,8
1359,Elaine,6," I think you're afraid to sit next to a man. You're a little               homophobic, aren't you?",2,Seinfeld,98,16
1360,George,6, Is it that obvious?,2,Seinfeld,20,4
1361,Elaine,6," Hello, Jerry.",2,Seinfeld,14,2
1362,Jerry,6, Hello.,2,Seinfeld,7,1
1363,Elaine,6, Did you get a haircut?,2,Seinfeld,23,5
1364,Jerry,6," No, shower. So, where are we eating?",2,Seinfeld,37,7
1366,George,6,"  ""You know, I'd go from nods               to nothing..""",2,Seinfeld,57,8
1367,Elaine,6," And now, there's this intense animosity whenever we passs.               I mean, it's like we really hate each other. It's based on nothing.",2,Seinfeld,141,22
1368,Jerry,6, A relationship is an organism. You created this thing and               then you starved it so it turned against you. Same thing happened               to The Blob.,2,Seinfeld,165,25
1369,George,6, I think you absolutely have to say something to this guy.               Confront him.,2,Seinfeld,86,13
1370,Elaine,6, Really?,2,Seinfeld,8,1
1371,George,6, Yes.,2,Seinfeld,5,1
1372,Elaine,6, You would do that?,2,Seinfeld,19,4
1373,George,6, If I was a different person.,2,Seinfeld,29,6
1375,Jerry,6," Hello.. hello. Is Glenn there? I'm sorry. Is this 805-555-3234?..               Yes, I know I have the wrong number. But I just want to know if               I dialed wrong or if..",2,Seinfeld,181,30
1376,Kramer,6, Come on up.,2,Seinfeld,12,3
1377,Jerry,6,"  Oh, it's you again. See? Now if you had answered               me, I wouldn't have had to do this. Now that's too long distance               calls I made to you why",2,Seinfeld,167,29
1378,Kramer,6, Taste this.,2,Seinfeld,12,2
1379,Jerry,6," No, I just had a sandwich.",2,Seinfeld,27,6
1380,Kramer,6," No, taste it. Taste it.",2,Seinfeld,24,5
1381,Jerry,6, I don't want cantaloupe now.,2,Seinfeld,29,5
1382,Kramer,6, You've never had cantaloupe like this before.,2,Seinfeld,46,7
1383,Jerry,6, I only eat cantaloupe at certain times.,2,Seinfeld,40,7
1384,Kramer,6, Jerry. This is great cantaloupe.,2,Seinfeld,33,5
1385,Jerry,6, Alright.. ,2,Seinfeld,11,1
1386,Kramer,6," Ah, huh. It's good?",2,Seinfeld,20,4
1387,Jerry,6, It's very good.,2,Seinfeld,16,3
1388,Kramer,6," Good, huh?",2,Seinfeld,11,2
1389,Jerry,6, Good.,2,Seinfeld,6,1
1390,Kramer,6, I got it at Joe's.,2,Seinfeld,19,5
1391,Jerry,6, Uh-Huh.,2,Seinfeld,8,1
1392,Kramer,6, Forty-nine cents a pound. That's practically half than               what you're paying at the supermarket. I don't know why you don't               go to Joe's.,2,Seinfeld,162,23
1393,Jerry,6, It's too far.,2,Seinfeld,14,3
1394,Kramer,6, It's three blocks further. You can use my shopping cart..,2,Seinfeld,58,10
1395,Jerry,6, I'm not pulling a shopping cart. What am I suppose to wear?               A kerchief? Put stockings on and roll 'em down below my knee?,2,Seinfeld,136,24
1396,Kramer,6," See, the other thing is, if you don't like anything, he               takes it right back.",2,Seinfeld,91,15
1397,Jerry,6, I don't return fruit. Fruit is a gamble. I know that going               in.,2,Seinfeld,77,13
1398,George,6, I'm outta there. I did it! It's over.,2,Seinfeld,38,8
1399,Jerry,6, You did it? What happened?,2,Seinfeld,27,5
1400,George,6," I told her. In the kitchen - which was risky 'cause it's               near all the knives. I started with the word ""Listen.""",2,Seinfeld,126,22
1401,Jerry,6, Ah ha.,2,Seinfeld,7,2
1403,Jerry,6," See, it's never as bad as you imagine.",2,Seinfeld,39,8
1404,Kramer,6, I liked Marlene. What's her number?,2,Seinfeld,36,6
1405,George,6," No, I, I don't think so.",2,Seinfeld,25,6
1406,Jerry,6, Could you stop that smacking?,2,Seinfeld,30,5
1407,Kramer,6," George, I want you to taste this cantaloupe.",2,Seinfeld,45,8
1408,George,6," Oh no, thank you.",2,Seinfeld,18,4
1409,Kramer,6, It's the best cantaloupe I ever had.,2,Seinfeld,37,7
1410,George,6," No, really. No, no, thanks.",2,Seinfeld,28,5
1411,Kramer,6," Jerry, tell him how good this cantaloupe is.",2,Seinfeld,45,8
1412,Jerry,6, It's very good cantaloupe.  So that's               it? You're out?,2,Seinfeld,68,9
1413,George,6, Except for one small problem. I left some books in her               apartment.,2,Seinfeld,80,12
1414,Jerry,6," So, go get them.",2,Seinfeld,17,4
1415,George,6," Oh, no. No, I can't go back there. Jerry, it's so awkward               and, you know, it could be dangerous - sexually. Something could               happen, I'd be right back",2,Seinfeld,177,28
1416,Jerry,6, So forget about the books. Did you read them?,2,Seinfeld,46,9
1417,George,6," Well, yeah.",2,Seinfeld,12,2
1418,Jerry,6, What do you need them for?,2,Seinfeld,27,6
1419,George,6, I don't know. They're books.,2,Seinfeld,29,5
1420,Jerry,6, What is this obsession people have with books? They put               them in their houses - like they're trophies. What do you need it               for after you read it?,2,Seinfeld,173,28
1421,George,6, They're MY books.,2,Seinfeld,18,3
1422,Jerry,6, So you want me to get those books? Is that it?,2,Seinfeld,47,11
1425,Jerry,6, So what'd you do?,2,Seinfeld,18,4
1427,Jerry,6," Well, I have a general idea what it was. I could take a               guess.",2,Seinfeld,77,14
1429,Jerry,6, No.,2,Seinfeld,4,1
1432,Jerry,6,  I don't know how this happened.,2,Seinfeld,33,6
1433,George,6," Jerry, it's not my fault.",2,Seinfeld,26,5
1434,Jerry,6," No, no. It's not your fault. Books, books, I need my books.               Have you re-read those books yet, by the way? You know the great               thing? When you read",2,Seinfeld,174,29
1435,George,6, That's standard. Has she left you one of those messages               where she uses up the whole machine?,2,Seinfeld,107,17
1436,Jerry,6," Ohh.. you know, and sometimes she'll go, ""Hello, Jerry?""               and I'll go ""Oh, hi Marlene."" And then it's ""Jerry..""",2,Seinfeld,125,19
1437,George,6, What about getting off the phone?,2,Seinfeld,34,6
1438,Jerry,6," Ohhhh.. you can't. It's impossible. There's no break in               the conversation where you can go, ""Alright, then.. ""               You know, it just goes on and on and on with",2,Seinfeld,183,29
1439,George,6," Just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion, right off! She               is sexy though. Don't you think?",2,Seinfeld,102,17
1440,Jerry,6," Yeah. Yes, she is.",2,Seinfeld,19,4
1442,George,6, Yeah.,2,Seinfeld,6,1
1444,George,6,"  Yeah, doctor. I'm going to have               to wait in that little room by myself, aren't I?  I better take this. I",2,Seinfeld,119,21
1446,Jerry,6," Waiting room. I hate when they make you wait in the room.               'Cause it says ""Waiting room."" There's no chance of not               waiting, 'cause they call it the waiting",2,Seinfeld,183,29
1448,Jerry,6," So, how was it?",2,Seinfeld,16,4
1449,George,6," I was in there for two minutes. He didn't do anything.                Touch this, feel that. Seventy-five bucks.",2,Seinfeld,113,17
1450,Jerry,6," Well, it's a first visit.",2,Seinfeld,26,5
1451,George,6," What's seventy-five bucks? What, am I seeing Sinatra in               there?! Amd I being entertained? I don't understand this. I'm only               paying half.",2,Seinfeld,164,22
1452,Jerry,6, You can't do that.,2,Seinfeld,19,4
1453,George,6, Why not?,2,Seinfeld,9,2
1454,Jerry,6, He's a doctor. You gotta pay what he says.,2,Seinfeld,43,9
1455,George,6," Oh, no, no, no. I pay what I say.",2,Seinfeld,34,9
1458,Jerry,6," No, I'm fine.",2,Seinfeld,14,3
1460,Jerry,6," Yeah, I know.",2,Seinfeld,14,3

1477,Jerry,6, It's okay.,2,Seinfeld,11,2
1478,Kramer,6," Let me taste it.  See, that               stinks. You can't eat that. You should take it back.",2,Seinfeld,95,16
1479,Jerry,6, I'm not taking it back.,2,Seinfeld,24,5
1480,Kramer,6," Alright, I'll take it back. I'm going by there.",2,Seinfeld,48,9
1481,Jerry,6, I don't care about it.,2,Seinfeld,23,5
1482,Kramer,6," Jerry, you should care. Cantaloupe like this should be               taken out of circulation.",2,Seinfeld,95,13
1483,Jerry,6, Alright. Take it back.,2,Seinfeld,23,4

1497,Jerry,6, I don't know how I'm going to tell him.,2,Seinfeld,40,9
1498,Kramer,6," Man, I don't understand people. I mean, why would George               want to deprive you of pleasure? Is it just me?",2,Seinfeld,119,20
1499,Jerry,6," It's partially you, yeah.",2,Seinfeld,26,4
1500,Kramer,6, You're his friend. Better that she should sleep with someone               else. Some jerk that he doesn't even know.,2,Seinfeld,118,18
1501,Jerry,6," Well, he can't kill me, right?",2,Seinfeld,31,6
1502,Kramer,6, You're a human being.,2,Seinfeld,22,4

1507,Jerry,6," Oh, my little airplane lamp.",2,Seinfeld,29,5
1508,Elaine,6," You know, you have the slowest elevator in the entire city?               That's hard to get used to when you're in so many other fast ones.",2,Seinfeld,141,25
1509,Jerry,6," Well, the apartment elevators are always slower than the               offices, because you don't have to be home on time.",2,Seinfeld,123,19
1510,Elaine,6, Unless you're married to a dictator..,2,Seinfeld,38,6
1511,Jerry,6, Yeah.. because they would be very demanding people.,2,Seinfeld,52,8
1512,Elaine,6," Right. Exactly. So I imagine at some point, somebody's               going to offer me some cantaloupe.",2,Seinfeld,104,15
1513,Kramer,6, Nope. No good.,2,Seinfeld,15,3

1518,Jerry,6, You talked to him?,2,Seinfeld,19,4
1519,Elaine,6," Yep. I spotted him getting his mail. And at first, I was               just going to walk on by, but then I thought ""no, no, no, no.               Do not be afraid of this man.""",2,Seinfeld,178,33
1520,Jerry,6, Right.,2,Seinfeld,7,1
1521,Elaine,6," So, I walked up behind him and I tapped him on the shoulder.               And I said, ""Hi, remember me?"" And he furrows his brow               as if he's really trying to figure it",2,Seinfeld,182,32
1522,Jerry,6," ""You little phony""?",2,Seinfeld,20,3
1523,Elaine,6," I did. I most certainly did. And he said, he goes, ""Oh,               yeah. You're Jeanette's friend. We did meet once."" And I said,               ""Well, how do you go from that to",2,Seinfeld,181,31
1524,Jerry,6, Amazing.,2,Seinfeld,9,1
1525,Elaine,6," And he says, he says, ""Look, I just didn't want to               say hello anymore, alright?"" And I said, ""Fine. Fine I               didn't want to say hello anymore either, but I",2,Seinfeld,181,30
1526,Jerry,6," You are the Queen of Confrontation. You're my new hero.               In fact, you've inspired me. I'm gonna call George about something               right now.",2,Seinfeld,162,23

1537,George,6, I don't know. But I don't. I'm actually almost happy to               hear it.,2,Seinfeld,79,13
1538,Jerry,6, I thought you'd be upset.,2,Seinfeld,26,5
1539,George,6, I guess I should be but I'm not.,2,Seinfeld,33,8

2450,Jerry,10, The problem with talking is that nobody stops you from saying               the wrong thing. I think life would be a lot better if it was like               you're always making a movie.,2,Seinfeld,187,31

2474,George,10, You're doomed. You're gonna have to have all your sex at               women's apartments. It'll be like a permanent road trip. Forget               about the home bed,2,Seinfeld,168,25

2494,Jerry,10," Yeah, I've heard that about wedding bands.",2,Seinfeld,43,7
2495,George,10,  I wonder if that's really true.,2,Seinfeld,33,6
2496,Jerry,10," That would be an interesting sociological experiment. You               know, Kramer has his father's band. He'd loan it to you.",2,Seinfeld,129,19

According to the information that I have in the envelope that         I've received, it seems that I may have already won some very valuable         prizes. Well, thank you, thank you very much, well thank you. It's very         nice to hear that. But, in all honesty, I have to say, I didn't even know         I was in this thing. But, according to the readout, it looks like I am         among the top people that they are considering. You know, that's what         annoys me about the sweepstakes companies, they always tease you with         that, ""You may have already won."" I'd like once for a sweepstakes         company to have some guts, come out with the truth, just tell people the         truth one time. Send out envelopes, ""You have definitely lost!""

2669,George,11," When I was ten years old, my parents had this very same statue         on the mantle of our apartment. Exactly. And, one day, I grabbed it, and         I was using it as a microphone. I was singing, ""MacArthur Park"",         and I got to the part about, ""I'll never have that recipe again,""         and it slipped out of my hand and it broke. My parents looked at me like         I smashed the ten commandments. To this day, they bring it up. It was         the single most damaging experience in my life, aside from seeing my father         naked.",2,Seinfeld,549,96
2670,Kramer,11," C'mon, George. I saw it first.",2,Seinfeld,31,6

2679,Jerry,11," Inka-dink, a bottle of ink. The cork fell out, and you stink.         Not because you're dirty, not because you're clean - just because you         kissed the girl behind the magazine..  And you are it! ",2,Seinfeld,204,34
2680,Kramer,11," What?! Wait a minute. No, no, no. What are you doing? No, no,         oh, oh, okay. He's out. I get it.",2,Seinfeld,104,21

2690,George,11," No, no, no, I don't want to carry it around all night. I'll pick         it up later.",2,Seinfeld,86,17
2692,Kramer,11," Oh, uh, well - okay. ",2,Seinfeld,22,5
2693,Jerry,11," Alright, let's go. Hey, you know, you owe me one.",2,Seinfeld,50,10

2713,Jerry,11, The toilet brush is under the sink.. ,2,Seinfeld,38,7
2715,Jerry,11," I don't really feel that comfortable with a maid, either, because         there's that guilt when you have someone cleaning your house. You know,         you're sitting there on your sofa, and they go by with the vacuum, ""I'm         really sorry about this. I don't know why I let that stuff over there.""         And that's why I could never be a maid, because I'd have an attitude.         I'd find them, whereever they are in the house, ""Oh, I suppose you         couldn't do this? No, don't get up, let me clean up your filth. No, you         couldn't dust. No, this is too tough, isn't it?""",2,Seinfeld,596,102
2717,Jerry,11," He really did an amazing job, look! He uncoagulated the top of         the dishwashing liquid.  He cleaned out the bottom         of the little egg cups. Come here, look at this.  He         cleaned the little one-inch area between the refrigerator and the counter.         How did he get in there? He must be like Rubber Man!",2,Seinfeld,327,54
2718,Elaine,11, There's no Rubber Man.,2,Seinfeld,23,4

6318,Kramer,29," That is *damn* good scotch. I could do a commercial for               this stuff. Mmmmm, boy that Hennigans goes down smooth. And afterwords               you don't even smell. That's right folks. I just had three shots               of Hennigans and I don't smell. Imagine, you can walk around drunk               all day. That's Hennigans, the no-smell, no-tell scotch.",3,Seinfeld,372,54
6319,George,29, Hello everybody.,3,Seinfeld,17,2

Well throw back a couple shots of Hennigans and you'll be as loose               as a goose and ready to roll in no time.

6361,Jerry,29, It's a woman in your room. So go ahead.,3,Seinfeld,40,9
6362,George,29," So she starts vaccuming, back and forth, back and forth,               her hips swivelling, her breasts, uh... ",3,Seinfeld,112,16

6388,George,29,  It's George.,3,Seinfeld,14,2
6389,Jerry,29, Come on up.,3,Seinfeld,12,3
6390,Elaine,29," Hey, let me ask you something something. Did George buy               that sweater knowing the red dot was on it because it was cheaper?                Ooookay, you just gave me the answer.",3,Seinfeld,190,30
6391,Jerry,29, No I didn't.,3,Seinfeld,13,3
6392,Elaine,29," Yes you did, yes you did. I saw your expression.",3,Seinfeld,49,10
6393,Jerry,29, I didn't have an expression. I have a deviated septum. I               have to open my mouth sometimes to breathe.,3,Seinfeld,115,19
6394,Elaine,29, How much did he save?,3,Seinfeld,22,5
6395,Jerry,29," Frankly I am shocked that you would ask such a question                of me, that you would think - the only surprise is how you could               even think of that. That's what you were seeing.",3,Seinfeld,199,34
6396,George,29," I have to talk to Elaine. This cleaing lady is turning               the screws on me. She's pushing for this whole relationship thing.               She keeps calling me, threatening to go to the boss with this thing,               I could lose my job, I gotta do something to keep her quiet.",3,Seinfeld,294,48
6397,Jerry,29, Elaine is in the bathroom. She's wise to whole red dot thing.               She's asking me all kinds of questions.,3,Seinfeld,116,19

6403,Jerry,29, No.,3,Seinfeld,4,1
6404,Elaine,29," Hey George, did you buy that sweater knowing that red dot               was on it because you could get it at a discount?",3,Seinfeld,122,22

Here I go out in               the spirit of the season  and spend all my savings to buy you the most beautiful               Christmas sweater I have ever seen to show my appreciation to you               at Christmas and this is the thanks that I get at Christmas.",3,Seinfeld,306,51
6408,Elaine,29, Well Jerry told me that you did.,3,Seinfeld,33,7
6409,George,29, You told her? How could you tell her? I told you not to               say anything.,3,Seinfeld,84,15
6410,Jerry,29, I didn't tell her you stupid idiot. She tricked you.,3,Seinfeld,53,10
6411,George,29," Elaine you don't understand. I had 103 temperature when               I bought that sweater. I was so dizzy I was seeing red dots everywhere.               I thought everything in the store had a red dot on it. I couldn't               distinguish one red dot from another. I couldn't afford anything.               I have nothing. I haven't worked for a really long time.  I mean look, I have no clothes, look               at what I'm wearing. It's just a little red dot.",3,Seinfeld,474,76
6412,George,29, This is for you.,3,Seinfeld,17,4
6414,George,29," As you care for me. Which is why it is very important that               you never breathe a word of this to anyone about the... you know.               What, with Clarence Thomas and everything. ",3,Seinfeld,197,32

6426,Jerry,29," I was in the men's room the other day and they had the hand               blower, instead of the paper towels, you know this thing. I like               the hand blower I have to say. It takes a little bit longer, but               I feel when you're in a room with a revolting stench you want to               spend as much time as you can.",3,Seinfeld,342,61

6435,Jerry,29, They had smooth trails. What about the Cumberland Gap?,3,Seinfeld,55,9
6437,Jerry,29, I know enough not to get on them.,3,Seinfeld,34,8
6439,George,29, Who said that?,3,Seinfeld,15,3
6441,George,29," Was that wrong? Should I have not done that? I tell you               I gotta plead ingnorance on this thing because if anyone had said               anything to me at all when I first started here that that sort of               thing was frouned upon, you know, cause I've worked in a lot of               offices and I tell you peope do that all the time.",3,Seinfeld,359,62

6475,Jerry,29," But in a way, I think I inadvertantly turned this guy into               an alcoholic. I hate being around alcoholics because they're either               telling you how much they love you or how much they hate you. And               those are the two statements that scare me the most. But I think               he's okay now because I have no idea how he feels about me.

7751,Jerry,40, This could be an emergency!,3,Seinfeld,28,5
7752,George,40, You never should have taken away his keys!,3,Seinfeld,43,8
7753,Jerry,40," I tried to give 'em back, he wouldn't take 'em. <Jerry and         George go out into the hallway to Kramer's apartment.>",3,Seinfeld,122,21
7754,George,40, How'd the Mets do?,3,Seinfeld,19,4

7763,George,40," Yeah, coy.",3,Seinfeld,11,2
7764,Jerry,40," You're being coy. Now where's Kramer, Newman?",3,Seinfeld,46,7
7766,Jerry,40," Listen, Tiny. I wanna know where Kramer is and wanna know now!",3,Seinfeld,63,12
7768,Jerry,40," Turn around, George.",3,Seinfeld,21,3

7771,Jerry,40," Now, you better tell me where Kramer is, or are we gonna have         to do this the hard way? <Hits wall with his fist.>",3,Seinfeld,122,24
7773,Jerry,40, Where's Kramer?,3,Seinfeld,16,2
7775,Elaine,40, What's going on?,3,Seinfeld,17,3
7777,George,40, No we're not.,3,Seinfeld,14,3
7778,Jerry,40, We're trying to find out what happened to Kramer.,3,Seinfeld,50,9
7780,Jerry,40, Bad rap?,3,Seinfeld,9,2

7785,Jerry,40," I never should have taken his keys away. But he drove me to it!         I had no choice! He wouldn't take 'em back. Elaine, you saw it, remember?         I said, 'Take the keys back.' He wouldn't do anything. You saw it, didn't         you see it?",3,Seinfeld,248,45
7786,Elaine,40," Yeah, yeah, I saw it. <mutters under her breath> I mean,         it's complete bullsh*t.",3,Seinfeld,89,14
7787,Jerry,40, Huh? ,3,Seinfeld,6,1
7788,Elaine,40, What...?,3,Seinfeld,9,1
7789,Jerry,40," No, what'd you say?",3,Seinfeld,20,4
7790,Elaine,40, Nothing. I didn't say anything.,3,Seinfeld,32,5
7791,Jerry,40," Oh, you didn't see it.",3,Seinfeld,23,5
7792,Elaine,40," Yeah, I saw it. I saw it! I did, I saw it. Yep.",3,Seinfeld,48,13
7793,Jerry,40," I heard you say something, there.",3,Seinfeld,34,6
7794,Elaine,40, I didn't say anything.,3,Seinfeld,23,4

7803,Jerry,40, Don't feel right? What are you talking about? ,3,Seinfeld,47,8
7804,George,40," Well, you know, I shouldn't have let you into Kramer's, now you         want to go into Elaine's...she entrusted me with her spare keys, how can         I just let you in?",3,Seinfeld,172,30
7805,Jerry,40, What is the big deal?,3,Seinfeld,22,5
7806,George,40," Just because you have someone's spare keys, it doesn't entitle         you to break into their apartment. That's the reason you took away Kramer's         keys.",3,Seinfeld,161,24
7807,Jerry,40," First of all, you're not even supposed to have Elaine's keys.         You're supposed to give 'em back to her, so she can give 'em back to me,         because she has mine. So technically, those are my keys.",3,Seinfeld,208,37
7808,George,40," Yes, well, if you had never taken your keys back from Kramer,         he never would have taken his back from you and given 'em to me, in which         case I wouldn't have had to take mine back from her.",3,Seinfeld,205,39
7809,Jerry,40," Well, I want those keys. <Tries to grab the keys from George.>",3,Seinfeld,63,12
7810,George,40," Nope, no can do.",3,Seinfeld,17,4

7812,George,40, Do you wanna fight?,3,Seinfeld,20,4
7813,Jerry,40, Do you wanna fight?,3,Seinfeld,20,4
7814,George,40, I'll fight ya! Not the face! Not the face! <The struggle continues.>,3,Seinfeld,69,12

7819,Kramer,40," Oh, he's cold.",3,Seinfeld,15,3
7821,Kramer,40," Yeah, yeah...that'd be funny.  Hey, you can drop me         here!",3,Seinfeld,66,10

7825,Kramer,40," What do you think, junior? You think these hands have been soakin'         in Ivory liquid? <mimics choking somebody>",3,Seinfeld,118,18
7827,Jerry,40," Don't you see? You're just avoiding the middle man. You were gonna         give her her spare keys, so she was gonna give 'em to me. So, all that's         happening is that instead of giving them to her, you're giving them to         me. It's just unfortunate that when she gave you yours, you didn't give         her hers. 'Cause then she would have given 'em to me, because she has         mine. So then I would have never had to ask you for hers, so that I could         get mine.",3,Seinfeld,485,87
7828,George,40," You're right, how did I miss that? <Begins unlocking the door,         mutters under his breath> Maybe because it's a crock of sh*t.",3,Seinfeld,133,22
7829,Jerry,40, What's that?,3,Seinfeld,13,2
7830,George,40, Nothing.,3,Seinfeld,9,1
7831,Jerry,40, I heard something.,3,Seinfeld,19,3

9086,Jerry,48," Look, the main thing is I don't want Elaine to know about               any of this. I mean, especially the panty remark. I mean, it's embarrassing.               And she's never let me",4,Seinfeld,186,30

9267,Jerry,50, What is it your business?,4,Seinfeld,26,5
9268,George,50, I'm interested.,4,Seinfeld,16,2
9269,Jerry,50, She reorganizes your closet and shows you how to maximize               your closet space. She looked into my closet.,4,Seinfeld,118,18
9270,George,50, So you thought she was good looking and figured this would               be a good way to meet her.,4,Seinfeld,100,18
9271,Jerry,50, Yeah.,4,Seinfeld,6,1
9272,George,50, Yeah. So what happened?,4,Seinfeld,24,4

9288,Jerry,50," Oh, right, right.",4,Seinfeld,18,3
9290,Jerry,50," Yes, yes, I did. But, you know, I was watching it on CNN,               and they covered it so well I thought, ""Why knock my brains               out?""",4,Seinfeld,152,26
9292,Jerry,50, Really?,4,Seinfeld,8,1
9294,Jerry,50," Oh, did he like it?",4,Seinfeld,20,5
9296,George,50," Anyway, we met with NBC about a month ago and they gave               us the green light to go ahead and write a pilot. In fact, we got               a big meeting with them tomorrow. They gotta approve of the story               before we can write.",4,Seinfeld,251,43
9298,George,50, Not a bad way to make a buck.,4,Seinfeld,30,8
9300,George,50," Well, I'll tell you, Stacey. It's a lot of hard work. But,               it comes fairly easy to me. Some people write symphonies. This is               my gift. ",4,Seinfeld,163,26
9301,Jerry,50," So, are you gonna go out with her?",4,Seinfeld,35,8

9303,Jerry,50, What about Susan?,4,Seinfeld,18,3
9304,George,50, What? I'm not married. I'm not allowed to go out with somebody               else?,4,Seinfeld,83,13
9305,Jerry,50, Depends.,4,Seinfeld,9,1
9306,George,50, Depends on what?,4,Seinfeld,17,3
9307,Jerry,50, On many factors.,4,Seinfeld,17,3
9308,George,50, Like what?,4,Seinfeld,11,2
9309,Jerry,50," Well, how long you've been seeing her. What's your phone               call frequency? Are you on a daily?",4,Seinfeld,107,17
9310,George,50, No. Semi-daily. Four or five times a week.,4,Seinfeld,43,8
9311,Jerry,50," What about Saturday nights? Do you have to ask her out,               or is a date implied?",4,Seinfeld,92,16
9312,George,50, Implied.,4,Seinfeld,9,1
9313,Jerry,50, She got anything in your medicine cabinet?,4,Seinfeld,43,7
9314,George,50, There might be some moisturizer.,4,Seinfeld,33,5
9315,Jerry,50, Ah hah. Let me ask you this. Is there any tampax in your               house?,4,Seinfeld,78,14
9316,George,50,  Yeah.,4,Seinfeld,7,1
9317,Jerry,50," Well, I'll tell you what you've got here.",4,Seinfeld,42,8
9318,George,50, What?,4,Seinfeld,6,1
9319,Jerry,50, You got yourself a girlfriend.,4,Seinfeld,31,5
9320,George,50," Ah, no, no. Are you sure? A girlfriend?",4,Seinfeld,40,8
9321,Jerry,50," I'm looking at a guy in a semi-daily with tampax in his               house and an implied date on Saturday night. I would like to help               you out, but...",4,Seinfeld,166,28
9322,George,50," Would you believe my luck? The first time in my life I               have a good answer to the question, ""What do you do?""               and I have a girlfriend. I mean, you don't need a girlfriend when               you can answer that question. That's what you say in order to get               girlfriends. Once you can get a girlfriend, you don't want a girlfriend,               you just want more girlfriends.",4,Seinfeld,416,66
9323,Jerry,50, You're going to make a good father someday.,4,Seinfeld,44,8
9324,George,50," Well it's not fair, Jerry. It's just not fair. All right,               all right. That's it. I'm getting out of this thing.",4,Seinfeld,125,21
9325,Jerry,50, Fine. Break up with her. But you know what this means?,4,Seinfeld,55,11
9326,George,50," No, what?",4,Seinfeld,10,2
9327,Jerry,50," The script, the pilot, the TV show. That's all over.",4,Seinfeld,53,10
9328,George,50, Why? What do you mean?,4,Seinfeld,23,5
9329,Jerry,50," Figure it out. She's one of the executives at NBC that's               gonna make the decision whether or not they pick up the show. She's               one of our biggest fans. You drop her off, you think they're gonna               pick us up?",4,Seinfeld,246,40
9330,George,50," Oh, right. Oh no, man.",4,Seinfeld,23,5
9331,Jerry,50," you know, it's a very interesting situation. Here you have               a job that can get you girls. But, you also have a relationship.               But if you try and get rid of the relationship so you can get the               girls, you lose the job. You see the irony?",4,Seinfeld,276,47
9332,George,50," Yeah, yeah. I see the irony. All right. What about this?               What if I can find some way to break up with her so that she'll               still like me and it doesn't affect the deal.",4,Seinfeld,195,35
9333,Jerry,50,"  Oh, yeah.",4,Seinfeld,11,2
9334,George,50," Wait, wait. Here me out. Don't dismiss this. You're very               quick to dismiss. Don't dismiss. She's got a big crush on David               Letterman, I mean, a big crush. She talks about him all the time.               Suppose I go up to David Letterman. He works at NBC; I work at NBC.               I explain my situation. He agrees to meet her. They go out, they               fall madly in love. And she dumps me for David Letterman.",4,Seinfeld,448,74

9355,Jerry,50, What did you have to give your TV away to George for?,4,Seinfeld,54,12

9357,Jerry,50," Yeah, but now you're in here all the time. ",4,Seinfeld,44,9

9399,Elaine,50," I was talking to this guy, you know, and I just happened               to throw my purse on the sofa. And my diaphragm goes flying out.               So I just froze, you know, ahh! Staring at my diaphragm. You know,               it's just lying there. So then, this woman, the one who sold me               this hair thing, she grabbed it before the guy noticed, so. I mean,               big deal, right? So I carry around my diaphragm, who doesn't? Yeah,               like it's a big, big secret that women carry around their diaphragms.               You never know when you're gonna need it, right?                Ahh. ",4,Seinfeld,627,98
9401,Jerry,50, So we'll talk about the hooks then?,4,Seinfeld,36,7

9404,Jerry,50," She's a virgin, she just told me.",4,Seinfeld,34,7
9405,Elaine,50, Well I didn't know.,4,Seinfeld,20,4
9406,Jerry,50, Well it's not like spotting a toupee.,4,Seinfeld,38,7
9407,Elaine,50, Well you think I should say something? Should I say something?               Should I apologize? Was I being anti-virgin?,4,Seinfeld,122,18
9408,Jerry,50," No, no, I mean...",4,Seinfeld,18,4

9416,George,50," I don't think I could do it. You know, they always remember               the first time. I don't want to be remembered. I wanna be forgotten.",4,Seinfeld,143,25
9417,Jerry,50," You need a little pioneer spirit. You know, you don't have               any of that Lewis and Clark in you.",4,Seinfeld,109,19

9419,Jerry,50," Yeah, me too.",4,Seinfeld,14,3
9420,George,50, We gotta get something. I don't want to go to that meeting               on an empty stomach. Let's get some Chinese. You wanna order it?,4,Seinfeld,138,24

9424,Kramer,50," I don't care, whatever.",4,Seinfeld,24,4
9425,George,50, I'll tell you what. Why don't we just get a couple of dishes               and we'll just share 'em.,4,Seinfeld,101,18
9426,Kramer,50, Okay. What are you getting?,4,Seinfeld,28,5
9427,George,50, I'm gonna get a Chow Fung.,4,Seinfeld,27,6
9428,Kramer,50, What's a Chow Fung?,4,Seinfeld,20,4
9429,George,50, It's a broad noodle.,4,Seinfeld,21,4
9430,Kramer,50," What do you mean, a broad noodle?",4,Seinfeld,34,7
9431,George,50, It's a big flat noodle.,4,Seinfeld,24,5
9432,Kramer,50, Well I don't want a big flat noodle.,4,Seinfeld,37,8
9433,George,50, What kind of noodle do you want?,4,Seinfeld,33,7
9434,Kramer,50, Who says I want a noodle?,4,Seinfeld,26,6
9435,George,50," All right, look. I'm getting the Chow Fung. You don't have               to have any.",4,Seinfeld,86,14
9436,Kramer,50, All right. I'll get pea pods and you can't have any of               my pea pods.,4,Seinfeld,82,15
9437,George,50, Fine.,4,Seinfeld,6,1
9438,Kramer,50, Get extra MSG.,4,Seinfeld,15,3
9439,Elaine,50," Look, Marla. This whole sex thing is totally overrated.               Now, here's the one thing you've gotta be ready for is how the man               changes into a completely different person five seconds after it's               over. I mean, something happens to their personality it's really               quite astounding. It's like they committed a crime and they want               to flee the scene before the police get there.",4,Seinfeld,437,63
9441,Elaine,50," Yeah, pretty much, yeah. Well, the smart ones start working               on their getaway stories during dinner. How, you know, they gotta               get up early tomorrow. What is about being up early? They all turn               into farmers suddenly.",4,Seinfeld,258,37
9443,Elaine,50, Eh.,4,Seinfeld,4,1
9444,Jerry,50," All right, let's go. We don't have much time before the               meeting. ",4,Seinfeld,80,12
9445,George,50, Where's the food? What happened to Ping?,4,Seinfeld,41,7
9446,Jerry,50," Don't worry, he'll be here. Look, we only got about two               hours. We just need to come up with one good story so we can get               through this meeting.  There's your food.",4,Seinfeld,191,32
9447,George,50," Hey, what about this? I'm in a car accident. The motorist               is uninsured, you with me?",4,Seinfeld,99,16
9448,Jerry,50, Yeah.,4,Seinfeld,6,1
9449,George,50," My car's totaled. It's all his fault and now, he has absolutely               no money. There is no way that he can pay me. So the judge decrees               that he becomes my butler.",4,Seinfeld,186,32
9450,Jerry,50, Your butler?,4,Seinfeld,13,2
9451,George,50," Right. He cooks my food, he cleans my house, he does all               my shopping for me. And there you go, that's your program.",4,Seinfeld,130,23
9452,Jerry,50, What about me?,4,Seinfeld,15,3
9453,George,50," Don't worry, we'll find something for you. ",4,Seinfeld,44,7
9454,Jerry,50,"  That's the stupidest idea I ever heard.               Sentenced to be a butler.  Ping, what happened?",4,Seinfeld,103,15
9455,Elaine,50, There was a bit of an accident.,4,Seinfeld,32,7
9457,Jerry,50, What happened?,4,Seinfeld,15,2
9458,Elaine,50," Marla and I went out for coffee and afterwards I was crossing               the street and he was biking right towards me. So I got out of the               way just in time, but then he ran into a parked car. He hit his               head and everything went flying.",4,Seinfeld,268,47
9459,George,50, Something happened to the food?,4,Seinfeld,32,5
9461,Jerry,50, Should I call an ambulance? Do you wanna see a doctor?,4,Seinfeld,55,11
9463,George,50,  The pea pods? All you saved               was the pea pods? ,4,Seinfeld,62,10
9464,Kramer,50," Hey, you got the food?",4,Seinfeld,23,5
9465,Jerry,50," Yeah, here.",4,Seinfeld,12,2
9466,Kramer,50," What took you so long? Hey, Ping!",4,Seinfeld,34,7
9468,Kramer,50, Yeah. Where's yours?,4,Seinfeld,21,3
9469,George,50, He dropped it.,4,Seinfeld,15,3
9470,Kramer,50," Oh, that's too bad.",4,Seinfeld,20,4
9471,Elaine,50," You should slow down, you know that? It's dangerous to               go that fast.",4,Seinfeld,83,13
9473,Kramer,50,"  Hey, you watchin' Oprah?",4,Seinfeld,26,4
9474,Elaine,50,  I did not jaywalk.,4,Seinfeld,20,4
9475,Jerry,50,  You're givin' him back that TV.,4,Seinfeld,33,6
9477,Kramer,50,"  No, I don't want it back.",4,Seinfeld,27,6
9479,George,50,  We got work to do. What about the meeting?,4,Seinfeld,44,9
9480,Kramer,50,"  Hey, look. An hour with Patrick Swayze.",4,Seinfeld,41,7
9481,Jerry,50," A month and a half we had. We did nothing. I can't believe               we put it off until today and then we couldn't do anything because               Elaine runs out to apologize to a virgin, crosses against a light,               and knocks over a Chinese delivery boy. Now we're gonna make fools               of ourselves, we got nothing. You're not even in show business.               I gotta reputation. You drag me into the sewer with you. I've been               on TV buddy boy. You know how fast word spreads in show business?               It's like that  , like that! One bad impression,               you're outta the business!",4,Seinfeld,645,100
9482,George,50," All right, let's postpone it. Let's get out of here.",4,Seinfeld,53,10
9483,Jerry,50, What do you mean? They know we're here.,4,Seinfeld,40,8
9484,George,50," I'll fake an illness.  My back! My back! I               can't believe, my back.",4,Seinfeld,81,13
9485,Jerry,50," No, no, would you get up?",4,Seinfeld,26,6
9486,George,50," I can do this, Jerry.",4,Seinfeld,22,5
9487,Jerry,50, No.,4,Seinfeld,4,1
9488,George,50," All right, I'll tell them my sister died.  My poor sister died. She was standing and then she was laughing               and then they SHOT her! That's the kind of sick city that we're               livin' in. They shoot you for laughing. I must go and comfort my               poor family. Jerry, take me home so I can comfort my... my poor               family.",4,Seinfeld,364,60
9489,Jerry,50, What?,4,Seinfeld,6,1
9490,George,50, That's David Letterman. I just saw David Letterman walk               by. I'll be right back. ,4,Seinfeld,95,14
9492,Jerry,50," Yes, I was very wise to hitch my wagon to his star. ",4,Seinfeld,53,12
9494,Jerry,50," Hi, how are you doing? Nice to see you all here. Hello.",4,Seinfeld,56,12
9496,Jerry,50," Oh, uh, nice to meet you. Where's Russell?",4,Seinfeld,43,8
9498,Jerry,50," Oh, poor Blossom. ",4,Seinfeld,19,3
9501,Jerry,50," Oh, he ran to say something to David Letterman.",4,Seinfeld,48,9
9503,Jerry,50," Yeah, he just walked by. ",4,Seinfeld,26,5
9505,Jerry,50," Yeah, good idea.",4,Seinfeld,17,3
9507,Jerry,50," Good, good, we've got a lot of ideas.",4,Seinfeld,38,8
9509,Jerry,50," Have you ever been to a Chinese restaurant and they tell               you it'll be, like, five minutes for a table and you wind up waitin'               there for, like, thirty minutes? Well, we thought it would be very               funny to do an entire show where all you're doin' is waitin' for               the table.  Because we've all been in               that situation. You know, you're waiting... and you're hungry...               and you bump into somebody you know... When is Russell coming back?",4,Seinfeld,513,78
9511,Jerry,50," Well no, that's one. We have many others. We have an idea               where, uh, I get into an accident with a guy who has no insurance               and the judge sentences him to be my butler.  You               know he cooks for me, he has to cook for me... He cleans my house,               he's doin' my shopping, you know? I'm walkin' around with one of               those big neck collars.",4,Seinfeld,400,67
9514,George,50," You tellin' 'em about the butler story? Is that beautiful               or what? Hey, sorry I'm late.  Russell?",4,Seinfeld,112,17
9516,George,50," Oh, Rita. Hey, Mr. Shermack, how're you doing, good to               see you. Jay, always a pleasure.  Sweetie.  Yeah, yeah, that butler idea,               that's beautiful. Isn't that killer?  I thought               I was getting the butler.",4,Seinfeld,245,34
9517,Jerry,50," Don't worry, uh, we'll find something for you.",4,Seinfeld,47,8
9518,Jerry,50," So Letterman didn't spark to your idea, huh?",4,Seinfeld,45,8
9519,George,50," No, he said there was nothing he could do, and next time               I should probably break the Prozacs in half.",4,Seinfeld,116,20
9520,Kramer,50," You, you guys wanna hold it down? I'm watchin' Jeopardy.",4,Seinfeld,57,10
9521,Jerry,50, Would you give him the TV back?,4,Seinfeld,32,7
9522,Kramer,50," Oh, by the way, George. Susan called for you a minute ago.",4,Seinfeld,59,12
9523,George,50, I bet they're probably doing summersaults about us over               there. You think they get butler stories like that everyday? ,4,Seinfeld,132,19
9524,Kramer,50,  Who is Joseph Cotton? Giddee up!,4,Seinfeld,34,6
9526,George,50," Hi, it's me. It's Georgie Boy. What's going on?",4,Seinfeld,48,9
9528,George,50, Fired? Why?,4,Seinfeld,12,2
9530,Kramer,50,  What is pi? Ooh! Giddee up again.,4,Seinfeld,35,7
9531,George,50, But I had no... I didn't realize.,4,Seinfeld,34,7
9533,George,50, I just feel terrible This is just terrible.,4,Seinfeld,44,8
9534,Kramer,50,"  What is the cha-cha? Ooh, yes indeed.",4,Seinfeld,39,7
9536,George,50,"  this is great! He fired her!               This is incredible, he fired her. I'm out, baby! I'm out!",4,Seinfeld,102,17
9537,Jerry,50, Why did he fire her?,4,Seinfeld,21,5
9538,George,50," Because I kissed her in the meeting. Russell found out,               he fired her over the phone. Finally, my stupidity pays off!",4,Seinfeld,131,21
9539,Kramer,50," What is here comes the judge, here comes the judge!",4,Seinfeld,52,10
9540,Jerry,50, You can't break up with her now. Her life is shattered.               You got her fired. You gotta be there for her.,4,Seinfeld,117,21
9541,George,50, What?,4,Seinfeld,6,1
9542,Jerry,50, You gotta at least wait until she gets another job.,4,Seinfeld,52,10
9543,George,50, Another job?,4,Seinfeld,13,2
9544,Jerry,50, Couple of interviews.,4,Seinfeld,22,3
9545,George,50," Oh, this is unbelievable. I'm stuck. Every time I think               I'm out, they pull me back in. ",4,Seinfeld,102,17
9547,Jerry,50, What? Leave? Where? Why?,4,Seinfeld,25,4
9549,Jerry,50, Why would I leave? This is my apartment.,4,Seinfeld,41,8
9551,Jerry,50, Who gave you this idea I would wanna leave?,4,Seinfeld,44,9
9553,Jerry,50," Listen, I wouldn't put too much stock into what Elaine has               to say about relationships. She comes from a broken home, and I               mean that literally. A tree fell on her roof and cracked the whole               structure. Her parents got along beautifully, but her house was               in bad shape.",4,Seinfeld,324,49
9555,Jerry,50, What else did you say to her?,4,Seinfeld,30,7
9556,Elaine,50, Nothin'. I was just givin' her the straight dope.,4,Seinfeld,50,9

10184,Jerry,52," But I have to admit, I like flying. I like               those little bathrooms that they have on the plane. It's kind of like a small               apartment of your own on the plane. You go in, you close the door,               the light comes on. It's like a small surprise party every time               you go in  there. The worst way of flying, I think is ""standby"",               you ever fly standby? It never works, you know, that's why they               call it standby-- ",4,Seinfeld,484,79

12418,Jerry,65," Nobody does. You know, nobody knows what to do. You just close your eyes and you hope for the best. I really think they're happy if you just make an effort. ",5,Seinfeld,158,31

12420,Jerry,65, You got the tap?,5,Seinfeld,17,4

12422,Jerry,65, The tap is tough.,5,Seinfeld,18,4
12423,George,65, It's like the manager coming out and asking you for the ball.,5,Seinfeld,62,12
12424,Jerry,65, Well maybe she just wanted to move on to other business.,5,Seinfeld,57,11
12425,George,65," No, no, this wasn't moving on. I got the hook. I wish I could get a lesson in that. ",5,Seinfeld,85,19
12426,Jerry,65, It's a very complicated area.,5,Seinfeld,30,5
12427,George,65, You can go crazy trying to figure that place out.,5,Seinfeld,50,10
12428,Jerry,65, It's a haaazy mystery.,5,Seinfeld,23,4
12429,George,65," Anyway, I think everything else is okay. Unless of course she's faking. ",5,Seinfeld,73,12

12443,Elaine,65, No.,5,Seinfeld,4,1
12444,Jerry,65, How can he not know that?,5,Seinfeld,26,6
12445,Elaine,65, Because I was gooood.,5,Seinfeld,22,4
12446,Jerry,65, I guess after that many beers he's probably a little groggy anyway.,5,Seinfeld,68,12
12447,Elaine,65, You didn't know.,5,Seinfeld,17,3

12463,Elaine,65, Not bad huh?,5,Seinfeld,13,3
12464,Jerry,65," What about the breathing, the panting, the moaning, the screaming?",5,Seinfeld,67,10
12465,Elaine,65," Fake, fake, fake, fake.",5,Seinfeld,24,4

12473,Jerry,65, She faked.,5,Seinfeld,11,2
12474,Jerry,65, Maybe they've all been faking.,5,Seinfeld,31,5
12475,Elaine,65, I'm sure they're not.,5,Seinfeld,22,4
12476,George,65, Maybe Karin is faking.,5,Seinfeld,23,4
12478,Kramer,65, She was probably joking.,5,Seinfeld,25,4
12479,Jerry,65," No no, it was no joke.",5,Seinfeld,23,6
12480,Kramer,65, She didn't have any?,5,Seinfeld,21,4

12484,Kramer,65," Well so she faked 'em, so what?",5,Seinfeld,32,7
12485,Jerry,65, The woman had an orgasm under false pretences. That's sexual perjury. ,5,Seinfeld,71,11
12486,Kramer,65, You know I heard her screaming from my apartment? She woke me up a few times.,5,Seinfeld,78,16
12487,Jerry,65," How did she do it? She's like Meryl Streep this woman. And I had to work the equipment. I'm not unskilled, I'm in the union. If she'd at least told me, maybe I could have done something about it. ",5,Seinfeld,197,39
12488,Kramer,65, Yeah I could have helped you out.,5,Seinfeld,34,7
12489,Jerry,65, What could you have done?,5,Seinfeld,26,5
12490,Kramer,65, I could have given you some pointers. I know how to press those buttons body.,5,Seinfeld,78,15
12491,Jerry,65, I'm feeling very inadequate about the whole thing.,5,Seinfeld,51,8
12492,Kramer,65, Aaaaah.,5,Seinfeld,8,1

12517,Kramer,65," You know, I faked it.",5,Seinfeld,22,5
12518,Jerry,65, What?!,5,Seinfeld,7,1
12519,Kramer,65, Yeah.,5,Seinfeld,6,1
12520,Jerry,65, You faked it? Why would you do that?,5,Seinfeld,37,8
12521,Kramer,65," Well you know, if it's enough already and I just wanna get some sleep.",5,Seinfeld,71,14
12522,Jerry,65," Yeah, but why would you... ",5,Seinfeld,28,5

12539,Kramer,65, So...,5,Seinfeld,6,1
12541,Kramer,65," You know this whole place is going vrrrrrrrrrrrrt, downhill. I could have come in here last week with a bad plum but I let it go.",5,Seinfeld,130,26
12542,Kramer,65, Oh now you don't want my business.,5,Seinfeld,35,7
12544,Kramer,65, But what am I gonna do for fruit?,5,Seinfeld,34,8
12546,George,65," You seem like you really enjoyed your Risotto. You have a very contented air over there. You look very contented, very satisfied. Are you satisfied?",5,Seinfeld,149,25
12548,George,65, I'm sure if you weren't satisfied you would probably say something wouldn't you?,5,Seinfeld,81,13
12550,George,65, Hey listen... instead of the movie... maybe we'll go back and... you know...,5,Seinfeld,77,13
12552,George,65, So... you feel okay about that whole thing... what we do in there... generally okay with everything in there?,5,Seinfeld,110,19

12622,George,65, It's like a magic trick. Sometimes I think it would be easier to bend a spoon mentally than to make that transformation.,5,Seinfeld,121,22

12630,Jerry,65, Well you'll have to go to the supermarket.,5,Seinfeld,43,8
12631,Kramer,65," The supermarket? That's impossible! They don't have a decent piece of fruit at the supermarket. The apples are mealy, the oranges are dry. I don't know what's going on with the Papayas! Jerry you gotta go to Joe's, you gotta get me some fruit! ",5,Seinfeld,245,44
12632,Jerry,65, Oh so what I'm going to buy all your fruit now? ,5,Seinfeld,49,11
12633,George,65," Well if Houdini couldn't do it, what chance do I have?",5,Seinfeld,55,11

12645,Jerry,65, How soft?,5,Seinfeld,10,2
12646,Kramer,65, Not too soft. Better too hard than too soft.,5,Seinfeld,45,9
12647,Jerry,65," I'm not going through this every week, I tell you that right now. And what are these? Plums? What is that?",5,Seinfeld,107,21

13378,Jerry,68," Then, what was all that sniffing? ",5,Seinfeld,35,6
13379,Elaine,68, Maybe it's the cold weather. ,5,Seinfeld,30,5
13380,Jerry,68, Today is not cold. ,5,Seinfeld,20,4
13381,George,68," All right, I've got to get going. My parents are expecting               me. ",5,Seinfeld,78,12

13435,Jerry,68," Look, it doesn't necessarily mean anything yet, it just               means he was sniffing. ",5,Seinfeld,94,13
13436,Kramer,68," Well, what else? Was he nervous? Did he use a lot of slang?               Did he use the word 'man'? ",5,Seinfeld,102,19
13437,Jerry,68," No, he didn't use 'man'. ",5,Seinfeld,26,5
13438,Kramer,68, I mean when he was leaving did he say I'm splittin' ? ,5,Seinfeld,55,12
13439,Jerry,68," No, but in one point he did use the bathroom. ",5,Seinfeld,47,10
13440,Kramer,68, Whoh! ,5,Seinfeld,7,1
13441,Jerry,68, Do you think that's a bad sign? ,5,Seinfeld,33,7

13461,Elaine,68, It's nothing. ,5,Seinfeld,15,2
13463,Elaine,68," Well, I was just curious why you didn't use an exclamation               point? ",5,Seinfeld,81,12
13465,Elaine,68," See, right here you wrote ""Myra had the baby"",               but you didn't use an exclamation point. ",5,Seinfeld,103,16
13467,Elaine,68," So, it's nothing. Forget it, forget it, I just find it               curious. ",5,Seinfeld,79,12
13469,Elaine,68," Well, I mean if one of your close friends had a baby and               I left you a message about it, I would use an exclamation point.             ",5,Seinfeld,149,26
13471,Elaine,68, You don't think that someone having a baby warrants an               exclamation point. ,5,Seinfeld,89,12
13473,Elaine,68, I just thought you would be a little more excited about               a friend of mine having a baby. ,5,Seinfeld,103,18
13475,Elaine,68," Well, you know Jake, you should learn to use them. Like               the way I'm talking right now, I would put an exclamation points               at the end of all these sentences! On this one! And on that one!             ",5,Seinfeld,227,37
13476,Jerry,68, You're out of your mind you know that. ,5,Seinfeld,40,8
13477,Elaine,68, What? ,5,Seinfeld,7,1
13478,Jerry,68, It's an exclamation point! It's a line with a dot under               it. ,5,Seinfeld,75,12
13479,Elaine,68," Well, I felt a call for one. ",5,Seinfeld,30,7
13480,Jerry,68," A call for one, you know I thought I've heard everything.               I've never heard a relationship being affected by a punctuation.             ",5,Seinfeld,150,21
13481,Elaine,68, I found it very troubling that he didn't use one. ,5,Seinfeld,51,10
13482,Jerry,68, George was right. Didn't take you long. ,5,Seinfeld,41,7
13483,Kramer,68, Anything new on that guy on drugs? ,5,Seinfeld,36,7
13484,Elaine,68, He's not on drugs. ,5,Seinfeld,20,4
13485,Kramer,68," Then why the sniffing? Who walks around *sniff, sniff*               sniffing? ",5,Seinfeld,80,10
13486,Elaine,68," All right, here, you call him right now. See if he's sniffing               right now. ",5,Seinfeld,88,14
13487,Jerry,68, Good idea. ,5,Seinfeld,12,2
13489,Jerry,68," Yes, I'd like to speak to Barry Prophet, please. ",5,Seinfeld,50,9

13495,Jerry,68," I'll call back, thank you. He went to South America! ",5,Seinfeld,54,10
13496,Kramer,68, Yyyeeaaah!! ,5,Seinfeld,13,1
13497,Elaine,68, So what? ,5,Seinfeld,10,2
13498,Jerry,68, Who goes to South America? ,5,Seinfeld,28,5
13499,Elaine,68, People go to South America. ,5,Seinfeld,29,5
13500,Jerry,68," Yeah, and they come back with things taped to they're large               intestine. ",5,Seinfeld,86,12
13501,Elaine,68," So, because of a few bad apples you're gonna impugn an               entire continent? ",5,Seinfeld,88,13
13502,Jerry,68," Yes, I'm impugning a continent. ",5,Seinfeld,33,5
13503,Kramer,68," Well, I say we're going to take our money right now! ",5,Seinfeld,54,11

13509,Elaine,68," Ok, gentlemen. The fact remains you still have no proof.               This is all speculation and hearsay. ",5,Seinfeld,109,16

13689,Jerry,70," Professional tennis. To me I don't understand all the shushing.               Why are they always shushing. Shh, shh. Don't the players know that               we're there? Should we duck down behind the seats so they don't               see us watching them? Tennis is basically just ping-pong and the               players are standing on the table. That's all it is. And that goofy               scoring, you win one point and all the sudden you're up by 15. Two               points, 30-love. 30-love. Sounds like an English call girl. ""That'll               be 30, love... And could you be a little quieter next time, please,               shh.""",5,Seinfeld,651,96

13704,George,70, No good?,5,Seinfeld,9,2
13705,Jerry,70," A party is a bad date situation. It doesn't matter who you're               with. You could be with J. Edgar Hoover. You don't want to sit and               talk with Hoover all night. You want to circulate.                Ho, ho, ho.",5,Seinfeld,235,38
13706,George,70, Why'd you pick Hoover? Was he that interesting to talk               to?,5,Seinfeld,73,11
13707,Jerry,70," Well I would think, with the law enforcement and the cross               dressing. Seems like an interesting guy.",5,Seinfeld,114,17
13708,George,70," Yeah I guess. What can I do? I gotta take her with me.               Todd introduced us, I'm obligated.",5,Seinfeld,104,18

13716,Elaine,70, You are kidding me. How am I supposed to get to this meeting?,5,Seinfeld,62,13
13718,Elaine,70," Oh forget it, I hate those. Everytime I take one, the driver               will *not* stop talking to me. No matter how disinterested I seem               he just keeps yakking away. Blah, blah, blah, blah. Why does everything               always have to have a social componant? Now a stage coach, that               would have been a good situation for me. Cause I'm in the coach,               and the driver is way up there on the stage. ",5,Seinfeld,444,71

13741,Jerry,70, I gotta talk to her. What do you think?,5,Seinfeld,40,9
13742,George,70, Cold? How are you going to do that? You're not one of those               guys.,5,Seinfeld,80,14
13743,Jerry,70, I'm going to psyche myself into it like those people that               just walk across the hot coals.,5,Seinfeld,104,17
13744,George,70, They're not mocked and humiliated when they get to the               other side.,5,Seinfeld,81,12
13745,Jerry,70, I have to. I won't be able to live with myself.,5,Seinfeld,48,11

13749,Jerry,70," I don't know, ""Hi"".",5,Seinfeld,20,4

13775,Jerry,70, I met this deaf lineswoman at the tennis match.,5,Seinfeld,48,9

13780,Elaine,70," No. When I shoo squirrels away, I always say ""get               out of here"". I never ever throw things at them and try to               injure them like other people. ",5,Seinfeld,169,28
13781,Jerry,70, That's nice.,5,Seinfeld,13,2
13782,Elaine,70," Yeah, and when I see freaks in the street I never, ever               stare at them. Yet, I'm careful not to look away, you know, because               I want to make the freaks feel comfortable.",5,Seinfeld,196,33

13789,Jerry,70," Kramer, I think perhaps you've overlooked one of the key               aspects of this activity. It's ball *boys*, not ball men. There               are no ball men.",5,Seinfeld,166,25
13790,Elaine,70, Yeah I think he's right. I've never seen a ball man.,5,Seinfeld,53,11

13794,Kramer,70," Yeah, yeah me too. Yeah he was at the snack bar eating               a hot fudge sundae. He had it all over his face. He was wearing               that chocolate on his face like a beard and they got in there real               nice and tight. And he's... ",5,Seinfeld,257,45
13796,George,70, I don't understand things were going so great. What happened?               Something must have happened.,5,Seinfeld,106,14
13798,George,70," You're giving me the ""it's not you, it's me""               routine? I invented ""it's not you, it's me"". Nobody tells               me it's them not me, if it's anybody it's me.",5,Seinfeld,177,29
13800,George,70, You're *damn* right it's me.,5,Seinfeld,29,5

13804,George,70, Yes well unfortunately you'll never get the chance to find               out.,5,Seinfeld,78,11
13805,Jerry,70, But I thought things were going great.,5,Seinfeld,39,7
13806,George,70, Yeah so did I.,5,Seinfeld,15,4
13807,Jerry,70, Did she say why?,5,Seinfeld,17,4
13808,George,70," No. She tried to give me the ""it's not you, it's me""               routine.",5,Seinfeld,76,13
13809,Jerry,70, But that's your routine.,5,Seinfeld,25,4
13810,George,70, Yeah. Well aparently word's out.,5,Seinfeld,33,5
13811,Kramer,70," Hey, George, I saw you on TV yesterday.",5,Seinfeld,40,8

13813,Kramer,70, Yeah you were at the snack bar eating a hot fudge sundae.,5,Seinfeld,58,12
13814,George,70, Get out of here. I didn't see any cameras there.,5,Seinfeld,49,10
13815,Kramer,70," Oh, the cameras was, vrooom, there. The announcers, they               made a couple of cracks about you.",5,Seinfeld,106,16
13816,George,70, Cracks? What were they saying?,5,Seinfeld,31,5
13817,Kramer,70, That you had ice cream all over your face. They were talking               about how funny you looked.,5,Seinfeld,103,17
13818,George,70, Maybe Gwen saw it. Maybe that's what did it.,5,Seinfeld,45,9
13819,Kramer,70, Well I'll tell you it wasn't a pretty sight.,5,Seinfeld,45,9
13820,George,70, She must have seen me eating it on TV.,5,Seinfeld,39,9
13821,Jerry,70, So she sees you with hot fudge on your face and she ends               it? You really think she would be that superficial?,5,Seinfeld,123,22
13822,George,70, Why not. I would be.,5,Seinfeld,21,5
13823,Jerry,70," Hello... Oh hi dad... You saw him?... Really with the ice               cream?... All right I'll talk to you later, bye. ",5,Seinfeld,122,20

13829,Elaine,70, I heard you *really* inhaled that thing. Did anyone tape               it?,5,Seinfeld,75,11
13830,George,70, Can we move on?,5,Seinfeld,16,4
13831,Jerry,70, He thinks Gwen broke up with him because she saw him eating               the ice cream on TV.,5,Seinfeld,95,17
13832,Elaine,70, Oh come on. If she's that superficial you don't want her.,5,Seinfeld,58,11
13833,George,70, Yes I do.,5,Seinfeld,10,3
13834,Elaine,70, So I guess you're not going to Todd's party on Friday.,5,Seinfeld,55,11
13835,George,70," Well I can't now, Gwen's going to be there.",5,Seinfeld,44,9
13836,Kramer,70, Well she should be the one that shouldn't go.,5,Seinfeld,46,9
13837,Jerry,70," Well if a couple breaks up and have plans to go to a neutral               place, who withdraws? What's the ettiquite? ",5,Seinfeld,120,20
13838,Kramer,70, Excellent question.,5,Seinfeld,20,2
13839,Jerry,70," I think she should withdraw. She's the breaker, he's the               breakee. He needs to get on with his life.",5,Seinfeld,114,19
13840,Elaine,70, I beg to differ.,5,Seinfeld,17,4
13841,Jerry,70, Really.,5,Seinfeld,8,1
13842,Elaine,70, He's the *loser*. She's the victor. To the victor belong               the spoils.,5,Seinfeld,83,12
13843,Jerry,70," Well I don't care, I don't want to go anyway. I don't want               to fight that traffic on Friday night.",5,Seinfeld,112,20
13844,Elaine,70, Well we can take the car service from my office.,5,Seinfeld,49,10
13845,Jerry,70, Really?,5,Seinfeld,8,1
13846,Elaine,70," Yeah, they don't know.",5,Seinfeld,23,4
13847,Kramer,70," All right, I'll see you later.",5,Seinfeld,31,6
13848,Jerry,70, Okay.,5,Seinfeld,6,1
13849,George,70," ""To the victor goes the spoils."" What are you               going to do tonight?",5,Seinfeld,81,13

13853,George,70, Well I was just going to wander the streets. Wouldn't want               to tag along with you or anything.,5,Seinfeld,108,18
13854,Jerry,70," Oh, uh, do you want to come with us?",5,Seinfeld,37,9
13855,George,70," Jerry please, that's very nice, but, uh,                where would we be going?",5,Seinfeld,81,12
13856,George,70," So, I've got ice cream all over my face. There were no               napkins there. Whoever it was that's responsible for stocking that               concession stand cost me a relationship.",5,Seinfeld,191,28
13858,Jerry,70," Let's get the check.  Is this considered               signing? Do you do this when you want the check? Really. I know               a sign, that's my first sign.",5,Seinfeld,163,26
13860,George,70, They're breaking up? How do you know?,5,Seinfeld,38,7
13861,Jerry,70, She reads lips.,5,Seinfeld,16,3
13862,George,70, What are they saying now?,5,Seinfeld,26,5
13864,George,70,"  Oh my gosh, I just               had a great idea. She could come to the party tomorrow and read               Gwen's lips for me.",5,Seinfeld,132,22
13865,Jerry,70,  What?,5,Seinfeld,7,1
13866,George,70,"  We bring her to the party, and she can tell me what Gwen               is saying about me.",5,Seinfeld,92,17
13867,Jerry,70,"  She's not a novelty act,               George. Where you hire her out for weddings and bar mitzvas.",5,Seinfeld,101,16
13868,George,70,"  Look. It's               a skill, just like juggling. She probably enjoys showing it off.",5,Seinfeld,91,13
13869,Jerry,70,  I don't know George. I'm               not sure about this.,5,Seinfeld,61,9

13872,Jerry,70," Uh Laura, George was wondering if...",5,Seinfeld,37,6
13874,Jerry,70, So I really had a good time.,5,Seinfeld,29,7
13876,Jerry,70, So you want to go to the party on Friday night?,5,Seinfeld,48,11
13878,Jerry,70," All right, we're taking a car service. So we'll swing by               and pick you up. How about six? . Six is good.               . You got a problem with six? . What? What? ",5,Seinfeld,177,32
13881,Kramer,70," I may be old, but I'm spry.",5,Seinfeld,28,7
13883,Kramer,70, Oh I'll be up for it punk.,5,Seinfeld,27,7
13884,Jerry,70," See I was saying ""six"" but she thought I was saying               ""sex"". We straightened the whole thing out though.",5,Seinfeld,117,19
13885,George,70," She confused ""six"" with ""sex""?",5,Seinfeld,31,5
13886,Jerry,70, Yeah.,5,Seinfeld,6,1
13887,George,70," Well if she can't tell ""six"" from ""sex""               then how is she going to lip read from across the room?",5,Seinfeld,110,20
13888,Jerry,70," Well ""six"" and ""sex"" are close.",5,Seinfeld,32,6
13889,George,70," It's two completely different sounds. ""ih"" and               ""eh"".",5,Seinfeld,67,8
13890,Jerry,70, Eh.,5,Seinfeld,4,1
13891,George,70, It seems like a problem.,5,Seinfeld,25,5
13892,Jerry,70, Well I'm not dating any other deaf women.,5,Seinfeld,42,8
13893,Kramer,70, Hey guess who's going to be the new ball man for the finals.,5,Seinfeld,61,13
13894,Jerry,70, You're kidding.,5,Seinfeld,16,2
13895,Kramer,70, Yeah. They said they haven't seen anybody go after balls               with such gusto.,5,Seinfeld,88,13
13896,George,70, When is that car service comming?,5,Seinfeld,34,6
13897,Jerry,70," In five minutes. He's then going to pick us up, then we're               going to pick up Elaine, and Laura is going to meet us there.",5,Seinfeld,135,25
13898,George,70, If this lip reading thing works tonight do you know how               incredible this is going to be? It's like having Superman for your               friend.,5,Seinfeld,159,24
13899,Jerry,70, I know. It's like X-ray vision.,5,Seinfeld,32,6
13900,George,70," If we could just harness this power and use it for our               own personal gain, there'd be no stopping us.",5,Seinfeld,115,20
13902,Jerry,70, Can't do it Newman.,5,Seinfeld,20,4
13904,Jerry,70, Not going to happen.,5,Seinfeld,21,4
13906,Jerry,70, Oh just pull over right there by the stop sign.,5,Seinfeld,48,10
13908,Jerry,70, I said pull over by the stop sign.,5,Seinfeld,35,8

13914,George,70, ah.,5,Seinfeld,4,1
13917,Jerry,70, You know the whole idea of taking the car service was so               I wouldn't have to fight the traffic on Friday night.,5,Seinfeld,125,22
13918,Jerry,70," I know. I'm late. Hey now I know two signs,  check, and  late. Hey this is the               guy you helped become the first ball man.",5,Seinfeld,135,25
13919,Kramer,70, She doesn't know what she's talking about.,5,Seinfeld,43,7
13921,George,70, Hey hey.,5,Seinfeld,9,2
13923,George,70, Why? Did she say something to you about why she broke up               with me?,5,Seinfeld,80,14
13925,George,70," I wouldn't hear of it, huh. It's none of my business. You               should try to find out everything you possibly can. In fact, I'll               even stay all the way on the other side of the room so there's no               chance of me overhearing anything.",5,Seinfeld,267,44
13927,George,70,"  Let's go, let's go. All right what are               they saying?",5,Seinfeld,67,10

13934,Elaine,70, She's so wild. Can I borrow her for a few hours tomorrow               afternoon?,5,Seinfeld,82,13

13989,Elaine,72, Why don't you go ahead and call him?,5,Seinfeld,37,8
13990,George,72, Because he made a big deal about how I understand everything               immediately. That's what,5,Seinfeld,100,14
13991,Jerry,72," So if you call and ask if you have the job, you might lose               the job.",5,Seinfeld,82,16

14722,Jerry,77," Uhm, The thing about eating the Black and White cookie, Elaine,         is you want to get some black and some white in each bite. Nothing mixes         better than vanilla and chocolate And yet somehow racial harmony eludes         us. If people would only look to the cookie all our problems would be         solved.

14754,George,77, Maybe it's not even stupidity. Maybe it's just a blatant disregard         for basic human decency. If this how dictator's start. Do you think Mussolini         would circle the block six times looking for a spot?,5,Seinfeld,214,34

15178,Elaine,79, Get out! ,5,Seinfeld,10,2
15179,Kramer,79," It's uncanny! It's like they chopped off your arms and legs,         dipped you in plastic, and screwed you back all together, and stuck you         on a pedestal. It's really quite exquisite. ",5,Seinfeld,194,31
15180,George,79," Kramer, what's the name of the store with the mannequin? ",5,Seinfeld,58,10
15181,Kramer,79, Rinitze.  Oh yeah... ,5,Seinfeld,22,3
15182,Jerry,79,  Uh... may I help you?  ,5,Seinfeld,25,5
15183,Kramer,79," It's this itch. I was watching TV without my shirt on, and one         my couch cushion didn't have any fabric on it. ",5,Seinfeld,119,22
15184,George,79," Wait a minute, Rinitze? Don't they have somme really cool suits         in there? ",5,Seinfeld,83,13
15185,Kramer,79, Real Boss! ,5,Seinfeld,12,2
15186,Elaine,79, I'm going down there. ,5,Seinfeld,23,4
15187,George,79," I'm gonna go with you. I gotta get a new suit. I got a second         interview with MacKenzie, and I think I'm really close. They're all taking         me out to lunch on Friday. ",5,Seinfeld,181,33
15188,Elaine,79,  Let's go.       ,5,Seinfeld,18,2
15189,George,79, All right. All right.  ,5,Seinfeld,24,4
15190,Kramer,79,  Are you gonna need this?       ,5,Seinfeld,33,5
15192,Elaine,79, It looks exactly like me. ,5,Seinfeld,27,5
15193,George,79, It's like some pod landed from another planet and took your body.         Don't fall asleep Elaine. ,5,Seinfeld,101,16
15194,Elaine,79, What's going on here? How do you think this happened? ,5,Seinfeld,55,10
15195,George,79," Whoa, look at this. This is a beautiful suit. Huh? ",5,Seinfeld,52,10
15196,Elaine,79, You think that could be a coincidence George? Is that possible?       ,5,Seinfeld,71,11
15198,George,79, You think so? ,5,Seinfeld,15,3
15199,Elaine,79,  Excuse me. Where did this come from?       ,5,Seinfeld,45,7
15201,George,79, You really think this looks O.K. on me? ,5,Seinfeld,41,8
15203,Elaine,79, I'm sorry. You can't tell me where the mannequin came from? ,5,Seinfeld,61,11
15205,Elaine,79,"  Well, is there somebody         around here I could talk to who would know? ",5,Seinfeld,78,13
15207,Elaine,79, Isn't it obvious? This mannequin looks exactly like me. ,5,Seinfeld,57,9
15208,Elaine,79,"  Did you just roll your eyes at him? Because let         me tell you something, if anobody should be rolling their eyes, it is         me at him about you. ",5,Seinfeld,157,28
15210,Elaine,79," What are you saying, that I'm not good enough for this hideous         dress?  Listen Natasha... I wouldn't be         caught dead wearing your crummy little euro-trash rags.          I'll meet you outside. ",5,Seinfeld,208,30
15212,George,79, Pfft! What can you do?          Is this the price tag? ,5,Seinfeld,56,10
15214,George,79," Yes, hello. Party's over.  ",5,Seinfeld,28,4
15216,George,79, So you think you can put the suit aside and hold it for me? ,5,Seinfeld,61,14
15218,George,79," Oh yes, of course, and we have to be fair.  ",5,Seinfeld,45,10
15220,Elaine,79," So, I found out who supplies the mannequins and I called 'em         up. ",5,Seinfeld,74,13
15221,Kramer,79, How did they get your face? ,5,Seinfeld,29,6
15222,Elaine,79, I don't know. They wouldn't tell me.  Jerry? Je...         Hello? ,5,Seinfeld,67,10
15223,Jerry,79,  Uh... Excuse         me. I couldn't help but notice you offered her a piece of your pie. ,5,Seinfeld,91,16
15225,Jerry,79, And you waved it away. ,5,Seinfeld,24,5
15227,Jerry,79, Did you give her a reason? ,5,Seinfeld,28,6
15229,Jerry,79, You were full. So you gave a reason. You didn't just shake your         head. ,5,Seinfeld,79,14
15231,Jerry,79," Exactly. You're not a psycho. You've been very helpful. Thank         you very much. Allow me to leave the tip.  Well, I think we proven who the psycho is. ",5,Seinfeld,157,28
15232,Elaine,79, We certainly have. ,5,Seinfeld,20,3
15233,Kramer,79," Hey, Elaine scratch my back. ",5,Seinfeld,30,5
15234,Elaine,79, No way! ,5,Seinfeld,9,2
15235,Kramer,79," Come on, one lap around. ",5,Seinfeld,26,5
15236,Elaine,79, No. ,5,Seinfeld,5,1
15237,Kramer,79, It will be a funky adventure. ,5,Seinfeld,31,6
15238,Elaine,79," Kramer, forget it. ",5,Seinfeld,20,3
15239,Kramer,79," Jerry, how about you? ",5,Seinfeld,23,4
15240,Jerry,79, I think you know my policy. ,5,Seinfeld,29,6
15241,Kramer,79, I'm going home to spatula.  ,5,Seinfeld,29,5
15242,Elaine,79, I thought George was meeting us here? ,5,Seinfeld,39,7
15243,Jerry,79, No he's going downtown to guard the suit. ,5,Seinfeld,43,8
15244,Elaine,79, He's guarding a suit? ,5,Seinfeld,23,4
15246,Kramer,79," Madam, I pray you're not toying with me.  Whoa. ",5,Seinfeld,49,9
15248,Kramer,79," Oh, all right.  ",5,Seinfeld,17,3
15252,George,79,  What's this? Can't I leave this place for a         second?  Can I help you? ,5,Seinfeld,79,14
15254,George,79," No, no, no, this suit is not for sale.  ",5,Seinfeld,41,9
15256,George,79,  No. ,5,Seinfeld,6,1
15258,George,79," Look, I'm doing you a favor. They're having an unadvertised sale.         This suit is gonna be half-priced starting ... Monday. ",5,Seinfeld,130,20
15260,George,79, Yes. Now take off those pants. ,5,Seinfeld,32,6
15263,George,79,"  You know honey for an unadvertised         sale, you're doing a lot of yapping about it. ",5,Seinfeld,91,15
15265,Jerry,79, I can't beleive your father owns this place. So how are the desserts         here? ,5,Seinfeld,84,14
15267,Jerry,79, You've tasted them? ,5,Seinfeld,21,3
15269,Jerry,79, Oh I see they have apple pie. ,5,Seinfeld,31,7
15271,Jerry,79, You've had the apple pie? ,5,Seinfeld,27,5
15273,Jerry,79," Audrey, I got to be honest with you. I'm a very curious guy. It's         my nature. I need to know things. Not tasting the apple pie the other         day, I can't get past it. You obviously like pies. You carry doughnuts         in your bag, you're not averse to pastry. Surely you could see how such         a thing would prey on my mind. ",5,Seinfeld,343,62
15275,Jerry,79,  Why can't I know? ,5,Seinfeld,20,4
15280,Jerry,79, Hello Poppie. ,5,Seinfeld,15,2
15282,Jerry,79, The pies. I'm going to the bathroom. You know. ,5,Seinfeld,48,9
15285,Jerry,79, Huh? ,5,Seinfeld,6,1
15287,Jerry,79," No, Nothing. ",5,Seinfeld,14,2
15291,Kramer,79, Hey. These are for you Olive. ,5,Seinfeld,31,6
15293,Kramer,79, Ohh! ,5,Seinfeld,6,1
15302,Jerry,79, So she tought I did it to get back at her ,5,Seinfeld,43,11
15303,George,79, Why didn't you just tell her? ,5,Seinfeld,31,6
15304,Jerry,79," I don't think that's the kind of thing you wanna hear about your         father. But I'll tell you when he came out of that bathroom and he was         kneading that dough, it was a wild scene. ",5,Seinfeld,195,36
15305,George,79, How could he not have washed? ,5,Seinfeld,31,6
15306,Jerry,79," Even if you're not gonna soap up, at least pretend for my benefit.         Turn the water on, do something. ",5,Seinfeld,109,19
15307,George,79," Yeah, just like I do. ",5,Seinfeld,23,5
15308,Jerry,79," You know a chef who doesn't wash is like a cop who steals. It's         a cry for help, he wants to get caught. ",5,Seinfeld,113,23
15309,George,79," Well, I think Poppie's got some problems. There's a whole other         thing going on with Poppie. So how did you leave ti? ",5,Seinfeld,126,22
15310,Jerry,79, We haven't spoken. ,5,Seinfeld,20,3
15311,Kramer,79," Well, I'm not gonna need this anymore. I got Olive.  ",5,Seinfeld,54,10
15312,George,79, Olive? ,5,Seinfeld,8,1
15313,Kramer,79," Yeah. My lady friend down at Monks. You guys ought to see the         way she works her nails across my back. Ohh! She's a maestro. The crisscross.         The figure eight, strummin' the ol' banjo, and this wild, savage free-for-all         where anything can happen. ",5,Seinfeld,270,43
15314,George,79, I got to get downtown and buy that suit. The store opens in twenty         minutes. ,5,Seinfeld,85,15
15315,Kramer,79, Is that Elaine mannequin still there? ,5,Seinfeld,39,6
15316,George,79," Yeah. The last time I saw her, she was naked. ",5,Seinfeld,47,10
15317,Jerry,79," Yeah, and Poppie's got problems... ",5,Seinfeld,36,5
15320,George,79,"  Well,         look at this.  This doesn't belong here! Someone has         made a terrible mistake. ",5,Seinfeld,102,14
15322,George,79," Hid? I have no idea how this suit got misplaced. Nevertheless,         I do believe I shall purchase it. ",5,Seinfeld,106,18
15324,George,79," Oh, I'll pay. Half-price. Arrivederci my fellow 40-short. ",5,Seinfeld,59,8
15326,Elaine,79," So I made a little list of people who might've made the mannequin.         You know, possible suspects. ",5,Seinfeld,105,17
15327,Jerry,79," Yeah, all right. Go ahead.  ",5,Seinfeld,29,5
15328,Elaine,79," There's this blind guy at a party I was at, and he felt my face         for a really long time. You know, to see what I looked like. He almost         put his finger up my nose. ",5,Seinfeld,179,36
15329,Jerry,79," Hum... ok, what else you got? ",5,Seinfeld,31,6
15330,Elaine,79," OK, I'm not gonna tell you the rest of the list. ",5,Seinfeld,50,11
15331,Jerry,79," Oh, because I didn't think the blind guy did it? ",5,Seinfeld,50,10
15332,Elaine,79, Because you have an attitude. ,5,Seinfeld,31,5
15334,Jerry,79, Georgio! Nice duds! ,5,Seinfeld,21,3
15335,George,79," You're telling me.  So, what do you think? ",5,Seinfeld,44,8
15336,Jerry,79, Did you hear something? ,5,Seinfeld,25,4
15337,Elaine,79," Yeah, like a swoosh. ",5,Seinfeld,22,4
15338,Jerry,79, Yeah. ,5,Seinfeld,7,1
15339,Elaine,79, It must be the fabric. It's rubbing between you thighs when you         walk. That's what's making that swooshy sound. ,5,Seinfeld,120,19
15340,George,79, I probably didn't hear it on the way over because of the street         noise.  This is no good! I got to meet these guys from         MacKenzie for lunch in half an hour! ,5,Seinfeld,173,32
15341,Jerry,79, So what? What would they care? ,5,Seinfeld,32,6
15342,George,79," This MacKenzie, he's a bit of a nut. Someone told me he fired         the last guy because his nose whistled when he breathed. ",5,Seinfeld,128,23
15343,Jerry,79, So you think you're not gonna get the job because your pants make         a noise? ,5,Seinfeld,84,15
15344,George,79," Let's say it comes down to me and one other guy. He's got a nice         quiet suit, and I'm whooshing all over the place! Who do you think he's         gonna hire? ",5,Seinfeld,166,31
15345,Jerry,79," You know, I think all these interviews are making you nuts. ",5,Seinfeld,61,11
15346,Kramer,79," Hey Jerry, I saw your girlfriend was in here before. ",5,Seinfeld,54,10
15347,Jerry,79, Audrey? ,5,Seinfeld,9,1
15348,Kramer,79," Yep. Sat down, had herself a piece of pie. ",5,Seinfeld,44,9
15349,Jerry,79, Was it apple? ,5,Seinfeld,15,3
15350,Kramer,79, What else? ,5,Seinfeld,12,2
15351,Jerry,79, This woman is bending my mind into a pretzel! ,5,Seinfeld,47,9
15353,Elaine,79, Hmm... No you don't. ,5,Seinfeld,22,4
15355,Elaine,79, The mannequin! ,5,Seinfeld,16,2
15356,Jerry,79," Oh, I got to see this thing. ",5,Seinfeld,30,7
15358,Jerry,79," Boy, the resemblance is uncanny. ",5,Seinfeld,34,5
15359,Elaine,79, You think you can pose me however you want? That's my ass in         your window! ,5,Seinfeld,83,15
15361,Elaine,79," No! You take down that mannequin right now, or I'm pressing charges.          Yes, this is my attorney. ",5,Seinfeld,105,17
15363,Jerry,79," Well, I believe there's some legal precedent - Winchell vs. Mahoney,       ",5,Seinfeld,76,11
15364,Elaine,79, Uh-huh ,5,Seinfeld,8,1
15365,Jerry,79, The Charlie Macarthy hearings. ,5,Seinfeld,32,4
15366,Elaine,79, Uh-huh. Are you taking this down? ,5,Seinfeld,35,6
15368,Elaine,79, Jerry get the car.  ,5,Seinfeld,21,4
15369,Jerry,79, What are you doing? ,5,Seinfeld,21,4
15370,Elaine,79, Just get the car! ,5,Seinfeld,19,4
15371,Jerry,79," Elaine, as your legal counsel I must advise against this. ",5,Seinfeld,59,10
15373,Jerry,79," I don't know about you, but I'm getting a hankering for some doublemint         gum. I'm dropping you off at work, right? ",5,Seinfeld,123,21
15374,Elaine,79, Where are you going? ,5,Seinfeld,22,4
15375,Jerry,79, Poppie's ,5,Seinfeld,10,1
15378,George,79," No, I didn't hear anything. ",5,Seinfeld,29,5
15380,George,79," No, can't say as I did. ",5,Seinfeld,25,6
15382,George,79, Could be the leaves... ,5,Seinfeld,24,4
15384,Jerry,79, Hello. ,5,Seinfeld,8,1
15386,Jerry,79, So how was the pie? ,5,Seinfeld,21,5
15388,Jerry,79, The apple pie you had today at Monks ,5,Seinfeld,38,8
15390,Jerry,79," Pretty good, wasn'it? I told you you should've tasted it. ",5,Seinfeld,59,10
15395,Jerry,79," Oh, about the... uh  ",5,Seinfeld,22,4
15401,Jerry,79," Well, Poppie's a little sloppy. ",5,Seinfeld,33,5
15404,George,79, I heard the last guy got fired because his nose whislted. ,5,Seinfeld,59,11
15406,George,79, No problem there. Conformity is an obsession with me. ,5,Seinfeld,55,9
15413,Jerry,79, So you didn't get the job. ,5,Seinfeld,28,6
15414,George,79, No. But I was the only one at the table that didn't get violently         ill. ,5,Seinfeld,80,15
15415,Jerry,79," Kramer, you can't keep avoiding her like this, you're gonna have         to say something. ",5,Seinfeld,92,14
15416,Kramer,79, What am I supposed to say? ,5,Seinfeld,28,6
15417,Jerry,79, Tell her you lost your itch. ,5,Seinfeld,30,6
15418,George,79, What happened to your itch? ,5,Seinfeld,29,5
15419,Kramer,79, I lost it two days ago. I've been faking it so I wouldn't hurt         her feelings. ,5,Seinfeld,86,16
15420,Jerry,79, Well you should tell her. ,5,Seinfeld,27,5
15421,Kramer,79," I'll let her down easy. All right.  Well, hi Olive.  No,         no. No more of that. There's something I have to tell you. ",5,Seinfeld,125,23
15423,Kramer,79," Uh, well, there's someone else. ",5,Seinfeld,33,5
15425,Kramer,79," Yeah, yeah, yeah... ",5,Seinfeld,21,3
15427,Kramer,79, Her. ,5,Seinfeld,6,1
15429,Kramer,79," Yeah, there she is. That's my gal. ",5,Seinfeld,36,7
15431,Kramer,79," Now Olive, look, I'm sorry. ",5,Seinfeld,29,5
15433,Kramer,79," Well, it's a style.  Jerry give me         the keys.  Well, I guess we're         gonna go for a drive now. She really loves that. ",5,Seinfeld,132,23
15434,George,79, Did you ever solve the riddle of the pie? ,5,Seinfeld,43,9
15435,Jerry,79, No. That's one for the ages. But I think they're gonna put Poppie         away for a long long time. ,5,Seinfeld,102,19
15436,Elaine,79," You guys are not gonna believe this. I just got a letter from         a friend of mine in Chicago who's shopping, and she said she saw a mannequin         that looked just like me. What if there're more. Where are they coming         from? ",5,Seinfeld,241,42
15443,Jerry,81, Good morning.,5,Seinfeld,14,2
15445,Jerry,81," Hey, you are the couch tonight, young lady. You were all over         my side.",5,Seinfeld,79,14
15447,Jerry,81," C'mon, I was sleeping with one cheek off the bed!",5,Seinfeld,50,10
15449,Jerry,81," No, no, 12-8!",5,Seinfeld,14,3
15451,Jerry,81," I know I can't beat ya, I'm just trying to stay competitive.",5,Seinfeld,61,12
15453,Jerry,81," Uh, let me get a coat. I think I'll try a sport jacket and scarf         thing, you know, like an unemployed actor. <Goes into his room, and         comes back out with the jacket on.> Haven't worn this one in a long         time.",5,Seinfeld,231,42
15455,Jerry,81," No, gore-tex. It's new. <Checks his pockets.> Hey, look         at this locket. What the hell is this? There's a picture in here, look         at that.",5,Seinfeld,152,25
15457,Jerry,81," No, I haven't worn this jacket since I got it back from the dry-cleaner.         Maybe we should ask him. ",5,Seinfeld,107,19
15459,Jerry,81, Yeah. What do you want to get for breakfast?,5,Seinfeld,45,9
15461,Jerry,81," Oh now, c'mon, you know I'm getting pancakes.",5,Seinfeld,46,8
15463,Jerry,81," But we can't both get pancakes, it's embarrassing. It's like one         step from the couples who dress alike.",5,Seinfeld,112,18
15465,Jerry,81," Ah, that's why I love ya. 15-9. <They go out into the hallway         and run into Kramer and his African-American girlfriend, Anna.> Hey,         how ya doin.'",5,Seinfeld,161,26
15466,Kramer,81, We just got back from breakfast. The pancakes were dynamite.,5,Seinfeld,61,10
15467,Jerry,81," Hey, is that my maple syrup? <Kramer hands it over.>",5,Seinfeld,53,10
15469,Kramer,81, Got to.,5,Seinfeld,8,2
15472,Jerry,81," Boy, it's a lucky thing I put the jacket on. But how did it get         in the pocket? ",5,Seinfeld,88,18
15474,Jerry,81," Oh, wow.",5,Seinfeld,9,2
15478,Jerry,81," Oh, come on!",5,Seinfeld,13,3
15480,Jerry,81, It's silly!,5,Seinfeld,12,2
15482,Jerry,81, Get outta here!,5,Seinfeld,16,3
15487,Jerry,81," Oh...yeah...you've never met my wife, Meryl? Meryl Seinfeld.",5,Seinfeld,61,8
15489,Jerry,81," You might regret that, because the money my wife spends on clothes...",5,Seinfeld,70,12
15491,Jerry,81," Ah - see the sense of humor? C'mere, I'm so nuts about you...<hugs         Meryl.> I tell ya, it was fun being single, but when you meet a woman         like this, you don't walk to get married - you run! ",5,Seinfeld,206,39
15492,Elaine,81," Oh, hi Greg.",5,Seinfeld,13,3
15494,Elaine,81," Yeah. Well, today was the first day I worked out since the Central         Park Mini-Marathon.",5,Seinfeld,95,15
15496,Elaine,81," No, but I exercised that day. <Laughs.>",5,Seinfeld,40,7
15498,Elaine,81," Yeah, I guess as an airline pilot, you're one of the few people         who can say that and mean it. <Laughs again. Greg looks at her, unamused.>         Um, do you have the time?",5,Seinfeld,181,33
15502,Elaine,81, Oh.,5,Seinfeld,4,1

15529,Kramer,81," ""My wife has an inner ear infection."" ",5,Seinfeld,39,7
15530,Jerry,81, See?,5,Seinfeld,5,1
15531,Kramer,81," I like that! Hey look, will you do me a favor? Will you take         my quilt into the cleaners for me, so I can get the discount too?",5,Seinfeld,135,28
15532,Jerry,81," Oh come on, we're gonna start doing this now? I can't be taking         all your dry-cleaning in!",5,Seinfeld,98,17
15533,Kramer,81," C'mon, just this one time! It's expensive!",5,Seinfeld,43,7
15534,Jerry,81, Alright. <Elaine enters.>,5,Seinfeld,26,3

15537,Kramer,81," We're engaged! Alright, I'm gonna get my quilt. <Kramer leaves.>",5,Seinfeld,65,10
15538,Elaine,81," Alright, listen to this. Remember that guy I was telling you         about at the health club?",5,Seinfeld,95,16
15539,Jerry,81, The fly-boy.,5,Seinfeld,13,2
15540,Elaine,81, Yeah.,5,Seinfeld,6,1
15541,Jerry,81," Hey, where's George? I thought he was with you.",5,Seinfeld,48,9
15542,Elaine,81," I waited, he didn't show up. Anyway, this guy gave me an open-lip         kiss.",5,Seinfeld,80,14
15543,Jerry,81, So?,5,Seinfeld,4,1
15544,Elaine,81, So? We've always just kind've pecked. This one had a totally         different dynamic.,5,Seinfeld,88,13
15545,Jerry,81, Really.,5,Seinfeld,8,1
15546,Elaine,81," Yeah. I mean, his upper lip landed flush on my upper lip. But         his lower lip landed well below my rim. ",5,Seinfeld,111,21
15547,Jerry,81, Moisture?,5,Seinfeld,10,1
15548,Elaine,81, Yeah. Definite moisture.,5,Seinfeld,25,3
15549,Jerry,81," That's an open-lip kiss, alright.",5,Seinfeld,34,5
15550,Elaine,81," Yeah. Listen, I think he's giving me a big signal...maybe he         wants to change our relationship. <The buzzer sounds, Elaine answers         it.> Yeah?",5,Seinfeld,157,23
15552,Elaine,81," Hey, what happened to you?",5,Seinfeld,27,5
15554,Elaine,81," Well, what was it? I mean, I was waiting.",5,Seinfeld,42,9
15555,George,81," Can I come upstairs, please? <Elaine pushes the button and         lets George in.>",5,Seinfeld,84,13
15557,Jerry,81," I don't know why you're interested in this guy, he's a jerk.",5,Seinfeld,61,12
15558,Elaine,81," Because, he doesn't pay any attention to me, and he ignores me.",5,Seinfeld,64,12
15559,Jerry,81," Yeah, so?",5,Seinfeld,10,2
15560,Elaine,81," I respect that. <George enters.> Mmm, what happened?",5,Seinfeld,53,8

15564,Jerry,81, Here we go.,5,Seinfeld,12,3
15565,George,81," Anyway, I think the guy in the shower opposite saw me. He gave         me a dirty look.",5,Seinfeld,88,17
15566,Elaine,81, You went...in the shower?,5,Seinfeld,26,4
15567,George,81," Yeah, so what? I'm not the only one! <Kramer enters with his         quilt.>",5,Seinfeld,77,13

15571,Kramer,81, I take baths.,5,Seinfeld,14,3
15572,George,81," Well, what was I supposed to do? Get out of the shower, put on         my bathrobe? Go all the way down to the other end? Come all the way back?",5,Seinfeld,145,30
15573,Elaine,81, Ever hear of...holding it in?,5,Seinfeld,30,5
15574,George,81," Oh, no...no, that's very bad for the kidneys.",5,Seinfeld,46,8
15575,Elaine,81, How do you know?,5,Seinfeld,17,4
15576,George,81, Medical journals!,5,Seinfeld,18,2
15577,Jerry,81, Do the medical journals mention anything about standing in a pool         of someone else's urine?,5,Seinfeld,99,15
15578,Jerry,81, Hello.,5,Seinfeld,7,1
15580,Jerry,81, What are you doing here?,5,Seinfeld,25,5
15582,Jerry,81," Oh. <Smiles at Marty nervously.> Well, I must have been         in the incinerator room when you left. Here you go, Marty. <Hands over         Kramer's quilt.>",5,Seinfeld,160,25

15607,Elaine,81," Sure. <Thinks - Ooh, a project. That's a definite signal!>",5,Seinfeld,59,10
15609,Elaine,81," Oh, thanks. <Thinks - That's no signal, who wouldn't like         me in this leotard? I look amazing in this leotard.>",5,Seinfeld,119,20
15611,Elaine,81," <Thinks - Okay, he open-lips me, he dreams about me, we         have an olive project...that's it, I'm asking this guy out.> Um,         you know Greg, I...",5,Seinfeld,157,26

15635,Jerry,81," Listen, Ma...",5,Seinfeld,14,2
15646,Jerry,81," Mom, I'm not married.",5,Seinfeld,22,4
15648,Jerry,81, I'm not married!,5,Seinfeld,17,3
15651,Jerry,81, I'm just pretending I'm married to get a discount on dry-cleaning.       ,5,Seinfeld,74,11
15655,Jerry,81," Well, whoopie whoop. <Meryl goes into the other room. Kramer         staggers in the door in his bathrobe.>",5,Seinfeld,108,17
15656,Kramer,81, Got any coffee?,5,Seinfeld,16,3

15658,Kramer,81," My quilt is still at the cleaners. Jerry, I can't sleep without         my quilt. Like the other night? I was cold. So, last night, I turn up         the heat - it's too hot. I open up a window - it's too cold. <Frantic>         I can't get into a zone!",5,Seinfeld,254,49
15659,Jerry,81, What is that? <Points to Kramer's pocket as Meryl comes back.>,5,Seinfeld,63,11
15660,Kramer,81," Oh, I forgot. <Hands back Jerry's can opener.>",5,Seinfeld,47,8

15666,George,81, They could kick me out of the health club if he tells them!,5,Seinfeld,60,13
15667,Elaine,81, So what do you want me to do?,5,Seinfeld,30,8
15668,George,81, Talk to him!,5,Seinfeld,13,3
15669,Elaine,81, How can I do that?,5,Seinfeld,19,5
15670,George,81, You said the guy gave you an open-lipped kiss!,5,Seinfeld,47,9
15672,George,81," Well, that doesn't mean anything!",5,Seinfeld,34,5
15673,Elaine,81," Are you kidding? That's very significant! If he was interested         in me, he'd want my germs! He'd just crave my germs!",5,Seinfeld,124,21
15675,George,81," Well, what about the open-lipped kiss?",5,Seinfeld,39,6
15676,Jerry,81, Bottle-wipe supercedes it.,5,Seinfeld,27,3
15677,George,81," Yeah, you're right, you're right. <To Elaine> Alright,         maybe he's not interested, but you still know him - can't you just ask         him?",5,Seinfeld,147,23
15678,Elaine,81," George...but if I ask him now, I will have no chance of going         out with him.",5,Seinfeld,84,16
15679,George,81, Why?,5,Seinfeld,5,1
15680,Elaine,81, I...I don't know...,5,Seinfeld,20,3
15681,George,81," Aha. Aha. Could it be because you don't want him to know that         you have a friend who pees in the shower, is that it?!",5,Seinfeld,125,25
15682,Elaine,81," No, that's not it!",5,Seinfeld,19,4
15683,George,81," Oh, I think it is! I think that's exactly what it is!",5,Seinfeld,54,12
15684,Elaine,81, Why couldn't you just wait?,5,Seinfeld,28,5
15685,George,81, I was there! I saw a drain!,5,Seinfeld,28,7
15686,Elaine,81, Since when is a drain a toilet?!,5,Seinfeld,33,7
15687,George,81, It's all pipes! What's the difference?!,5,Seinfeld,40,6
15688,Elaine,81, Different pipes go to different places! You're gonna mix 'em         up!,5,Seinfeld,73,11
15689,George,81, I'll call a plumber right now! <Goes for the phone.>,5,Seinfeld,53,10

15696,Kramer,81, I'm so tired!,5,Seinfeld,14,3
15698,Kramer,81, Huh? I don't?,5,Seinfeld,14,3
15699,Elaine,81," No, you look pale.",5,Seinfeld,19,4
15700,Kramer,81, Pale? Oh my God...I gotta meet Anna's parents today! <The         phone rings.>,5,Seinfeld,80,12
15701,Jerry,81," Hello? Oh, hi honey. <annoyed, weary> Yes, I told him. I'll         get it. <George and Elaine give each other a look, then leave Jerry         to argue with Meryl on the phone.> Whenever. Okay, I'm sorry...",5,Seinfeld,208,35
15703,Kramer,81, Not ready? It has to be ready! What kind of a business are you         running here?,5,Seinfeld,85,16
15705,Jerry,81," He's a very good friend of mine, he's kind've like an older brother         to me...when things don't go right, he kinda takes it personally.",5,Seinfeld,142,24
15708,Jerry,81," Oh, it's okay, it'll be okay.",5,Seinfeld,30,6

15712,Jerry,81, I can't believe you still do that. You know those things are bad         for ya.,5,Seinfeld,81,15
15713,Kramer,81," Hey, that's how I maintain my glow. ",5,Seinfeld,37,7
15714,Jerry,81, I'm goin' home. <Kramer exits. An attractive woman enters the         dry-cleaners with a bundle of clothes in her hands. Jerry notices her         and waits by the door.>,5,Seinfeld,172,27
15719,Elaine,81," Hi, Greg.",5,Seinfeld,10,2
15721,Elaine,81," I got the machine next, buddy. <Greg finishes up his workout         and gets off the machine.>",5,Seinfeld,96,16

15724,Elaine,81," Never mind that, look at the signal I just got.",5,Seinfeld,48,10
15725,George,81, Signal? What signal?,5,Seinfeld,21,3
15726,Elaine,81," Lookit. He knew I was gonna use the machine next, he didn't wipe         his sweat off. That's a gesture of intimacy.",5,Seinfeld,118,21
15727,George,81, I'll tell you what that is - that's a violation of club rules.         Now I got him! And you're my witness!,5,Seinfeld,109,21
15728,Elaine,81," Listen, George! Listen! He knew what he was doing, this was a         signal.",5,Seinfeld,78,13
15729,George,81," A guy leaves a puddle of sweat, that's a signal?",5,Seinfeld,49,10
15730,Elaine,81, Yeah! It's a social thing.,5,Seinfeld,27,5
15731,George,81," What if he left you a used Kleenex, what's that, a valentine?         Now you go up to him and you tell him that if he's thinking of turning         me in, that I got the goods on him!",5,Seinfeld,185,37
15732,Elaine,81, No! I won't be a party to this.,5,Seinfeld,32,8
15733,George,81, So you're gonna let me get suspended for shower urination?,5,Seinfeld,59,10
15734,Elaine,81," Okay, I'll talk to him. But you're putting me in a very difficult         position. <Walks away.>",5,Seinfeld,98,16
15736,Jerry,81, I want to!,5,Seinfeld,11,3
15738,Jerry,81, Give me the clothes. ,5,Seinfeld,22,4
15740,Jerry,81," Oh, the hell with her. <Paula dramatically flees from the coffee         shop. Jerry thinks for a second, then follows her and catches up to her         on the street.>",5,Seinfeld,169,28
15742,Jerry,81, I'm not gonna let you walk out of my life.,5,Seinfeld,43,10
15744,Jerry,81, Do you want box or hanger?,5,Seinfeld,27,6
15746,Elaine,81," You're really working up quite a sweat today, huh?",5,Seinfeld,51,9
15748,Elaine,81, Are you sure you want to do that?,5,Seinfeld,34,8
15750,Elaine,81, You're interested in...in her? <Points at the manager.>,5,Seinfeld,56,8

15754,Elaine,81," You know, Greg, I wouldn't do that if I were you.",5,Seinfeld,50,11
15756,Elaine,81," Well, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it a violation of club         policy to not wipe down a machine after using it?",5,Seinfeld,122,23
15758,Elaine,81," Yeah, well, at least he had a drain.",5,Seinfeld,37,8
15765,Jerry,81, I'm sorry.,5,Seinfeld,11,2
15767,Jerry,81, It doesn't matter. I want a divorce.,5,Seinfeld,37,7
15769,Jerry,81," Yes, that's right.",5,Seinfeld,19,3
15771,Jerry,81, I'll tell you what happened. We got married.,5,Seinfeld,45,8
15773,Jerry,81, No. I guess I just wasn't ready for the responsibilities of a         pretend marriage.,5,Seinfeld,88,14
15775,Jerry,81," It's alright, I want you to have it.",5,Seinfeld,37,8
15777,Jerry,81, We'll always have...pancakes.,5,Seinfeld,30,3
15781,Jerry,82, You know their timing couldn't be worse.,5,Seinfeld,41,7
15782,George,82, Is there ever a good time to have your parents stay with you?,5,Seinfeld,62,13
15783,Jerry,82," You don't understand, I haven't been together with Rachel for         like three weeks. First I was on the road, then my parents show up, I'm         getting a little uh backed up. ",5,Seinfeld,182,31
15784,George,82, When are they leaving for Paris?,5,Seinfeld,33,6

15787,Jerry,82, She lives with her parents.,5,Seinfeld,28,5
15788,George,82," Really?  Maybe this will become like a         cool thing, living with your parents.",5,Seinfeld,85,13
15789,Jerry,82," Ya, then maybe baldness will catch on. This will         all be turning your way. ",5,Seinfeld,83,14
15790,George,82," Hey believe me, baldness will catch on. When the aliens come,         who do you think they're gonna relate to? Who do you think is going to         be the first ones getting a tour of the ship?",5,Seinfeld,195,36
15791,Jerry,82, The baldies,5,Seinfeld,12,2

16278,Elaine,83," Uhuh, um you didn't feel uncomfortable spending the whole day         at the museum with two complete strangers who were more than twice your         age?",5,Seinfeld,155,24

16344,Elaine,84," Well, I don't know about ""gold.""",5,Seinfeld,33,6
16345,Jerry,84," Oh, that's gold, baby.",5,Seinfeld,23,4
16346,Elaine,84," 'Baby'? What, are you doing George now?",5,Seinfeld,40,7
16347,Jerry,84, I was saying 'baby' way before George!,5,Seinfeld,39,7
16348,Elaine,84," Well, I don't know, don't ask me any more questions about jokes,         Jerry, it puts too much pressure on me.",5,Seinfeld,113,20
16349,Jerry,84," Well, this guy Leonard Christian's gonna be there tomorrow night.",5,Seinfeld,66,10
16350,Elaine,84," Yeah, who's he?",5,Seinfeld,16,3

16378,George,84, How about Bozo?,5,Seinfeld,16,3
16380,George,84," Who's Bozo? Bozo the Clown, that's who Bozo is. When I was a         kid, Bozo the Clown was the clown, bar none. ",5,Seinfeld,115,22
16382,George,84," With the orange hair, and the big clown shirt with the ruffles...",5,Seinfeld,66,12
16384,George,84, And the TV show! He had cartoons!,5,Seinfeld,34,7
16386,George,84," You know, when I was a kid, we didn't have these elaborate birthday         parties with catered food and entertainment. I remember my 7th birthday         party...",5,Seinfeld,165,25

16419,Jerry,84," Yeah, I know.",5,Seinfeld,14,3
16421,Jerry,84, I don't...think so.,5,Seinfeld,20,3
16423,Jerry,84, I don't...I dunno.,5,Seinfeld,19,3
16425,Jerry,84," Oh, is this a bit?",5,Seinfeld,19,5
16427,Kramer,84," Hey, Jerry. Toby, this is Jerry.",5,Seinfeld,33,6

16444,Jerry,84, Men definitely hit the remote button more than women...,5,Seinfeld,56,9

16450,Jerry,84, ...that's why men hunt and women nest.,5,Seinfeld,39,7
16452,Jerry,84," Hey, what's the deal? What was goin' on there? I invite you down         here, I have an important show, and she heckles me?!",5,Seinfeld,126,23
16453,Kramer,84," Look, she didn't mean anything.",5,Seinfeld,32,5
16454,Jerry,84," Well, what is the matter with her? Is she crazy?!",5,Seinfeld,50,10
16455,Kramer,84," She's just being enthusiastic, that's all!",5,Seinfeld,43,6
16456,Jerry,84, Hey! What is wrong with you?!,5,Seinfeld,30,6
16458,Jerry,84, You boo me?! You hiss?! You didn't stop blathering throughout         the whole set!,5,Seinfeld,85,13
16460,Jerry,84, No! Not part of the show! Booing and hissing are not part of the         show! You boo puppets! You hiss villains in silent movies!,5,Seinfeld,132,24
16462,Jerry,84," Oh, I can take it.",5,Seinfeld,19,5
16465,George,84, Bozo? ,5,Seinfeld,7,1
16467,George,84, B-O-Z-O? ,5,Seinfeld,10,1
16469,George,84, You've never heard of Bozo the Clown?,5,Seinfeld,38,7
16471,George,84, How could you not know who Bozo the Clown is?,5,Seinfeld,46,10
16473,George,84, How can you call yourself a clown and not know who Bozo is?,5,Seinfeld,60,13
16475,George,84," Is he a clown? What, are you kidding me!?",5,Seinfeld,42,9
16477,George,84," Yes, he's a clown!",5,Seinfeld,19,4
16479,George,84," Alright, just forget it.",5,Seinfeld,25,4
16481,George,84," Alright, very good, very good...go fold your little balloon animals,         Eric. Eric! What kind of name is that for a clown, huh?",5,Seinfeld,133,22
16483,George,84," Well, I do what I can. <Robin comes over.>",5,Seinfeld,43,9
16487,George,84," Ah, great, great. <sniffs> What's that smell? Smoke? <walks         to the kitchen> Hey everybody, I think I smell some smoke back here...<smoke         boils into the doorway.> FIRE! FIRE! Get out of the way!",5,Seinfeld,210,33
16493,George,84," Because! Because, as the leader...if I die...then all hope is         lost! Who would lead? The clown? Instead of castigating me, you should         all be thanking me. What kind of a topsy-turvy world do we live in, where         heroes are cast as villains? Brave men as cowards?",5,Seinfeld,282,46
16495,George,84," Seemingly. Seemingly, to the untrained eye, I can fully understand         how you got that impression. What looked like pushing...what looked like         knocking down...was a safety precaution! In a fire, you stay close to         the ground, am I right? And when I ran out that door, I was not leaving         anyone behind! Oh, quite the contrary! I risked my life making sure that         exit was clear. Any other questions?",5,Seinfeld,432,68
16497,George,84, Its not easy.,5,Seinfeld,14,3
16498,George,84, So she doesn't want to see me anymore.,5,Seinfeld,39,8
16499,Jerry,84," Did you knock her over too, or just the kids?",5,Seinfeld,46,10
16500,George,84," No, her too. And her mother.",5,Seinfeld,29,6
16501,Jerry,84, Really? Her mother.,5,Seinfeld,20,3
16502,George,84," Yeah. I may have stepped on her arm, too, I don't know.",5,Seinfeld,56,12
16503,Jerry,84, You probably couldn't see because of the smoke.,5,Seinfeld,48,8
16504,George,84, Yeah. But it was somebody's arm.,5,Seinfeld,33,6
16505,Jerry,84," So you feel ""women and children first,"" in this day         and age, is somewhat of an antiquated notion.",5,Seinfeld,106,18
16506,George,84, To some degree.,5,Seinfeld,16,3
16507,Jerry,84," So basically, it's every man, woman, child, and invalid for themselves.",5,Seinfeld,72,11
16508,George,84, In a manner of speaking.,5,Seinfeld,25,5
16509,Jerry,84," Well, it's honest.",5,Seinfeld,19,3
16510,George,84, Yeah. She should be commending me for treating everyone like         equals.,5,Seinfeld,77,11
16511,Jerry,84," Well, perhaps when she's released from the burn center, she'll         see things differently.",5,Seinfeld,95,13
16512,George,84, Perhaps.,5,Seinfeld,9,1
16513,Jerry,84," So, what was the fire? Just a couple of greasy hamburgers?",5,Seinfeld,59,11
16514,George,84, Yeah. Eric the Clown put it out with his big shoe.,5,Seinfeld,51,11
16515,Jerry,84," By the way, did you see this? <Hands George a magazine>",5,Seinfeld,56,11
16516,George,84, What's that?,5,Seinfeld,13,2
16517,Jerry,84," It's the Leonard Christian article about my show. Plus my gig         in Miami got cancelled, I betcha it's because of the article.",5,Seinfeld,132,22
16518,George,84," Wow, he really does a number on you. <reads> ""Seinfeld         froze like a deer in the headlights in the face of incessant heckling.""",5,Seinfeld,135,23
16519,Jerry,84, I should have let her have it! I held back because of Kramer.,5,Seinfeld,62,13
16520,George,84, You know what you oughta do. You should go to her office and         heckle her. ,5,Seinfeld,82,15
16521,Jerry,84," Yeah, right.",5,Seinfeld,13,2
16522,George,84," You know, like all the comedians always say, 'How would you like         it if I came to where you work and heckled you?'",5,Seinfeld,122,23
16523,Jerry,84," Yeah, that'd be something.",5,Seinfeld,27,4
16524,George,84," I'm not kidding, you should do it.",5,Seinfeld,35,7
16525,Jerry,84, But wouldn't that be the ultimate comedian's revenge? I've always         had a fantasy about doing that.,5,Seinfeld,106,16
16526,George,84," Well, go ahead! Do it!",5,Seinfeld,23,5
16527,Jerry,84, Why can't I?,5,Seinfeld,13,3
16528,George,84, No reason!,5,Seinfeld,11,2
16529,Jerry,84," You know what? I think I'm gonna do that! She came down to where         I work, I'll go down to where she works!",5,Seinfeld,114,23
16530,George,84, This is unprecedented!,5,Seinfeld,23,3
16531,Jerry,84," There's no precedent, baby!",5,Seinfeld,28,4
16532,George,84, What...are you using my babies now?,5,Seinfeld,36,6
16533,Jerry,84," Hey, nice shoes. What, you wear sandals to work? It's always nice         to walk into a room and get the aroma of feet. That's real conducive to         the work atmosphere. I'm sure your co-workers really appreciate it. 'Hey,         let's go eat in Toby's office. Great idea! We can check on her bunions!'",5,Seinfeld,309,52
16535,Jerry,84," Oh, is this disruptive? You find it hard to work with someone...interrupting?",5,Seinfeld,78,12
16537,Jerry,84," Security? Well, I don't know how you're gonna make it in this         business if you can't take it! Ya gotta be tough! Booo! Boooo!",5,Seinfeld,133,24
16538,Kramer,84," Wait a second, what's happenin' here? Toby! Toby!",5,Seinfeld,50,8
16539,Kramer,84, What did you go up there to heckle her for?,5,Seinfeld,44,10
16540,Jerry,84, Because she came down to the club and heckled me! Give her a taste         of her own medicine! <George enters.>,5,Seinfeld,113,20
16541,Kramer,84," Oh, YEAH! You gave her a taste of medicine, alright.",5,Seinfeld,53,10
16542,Jerry,84," Well, I didn't want her to have an accident.",5,Seinfeld,45,9
16543,George,84, What accident?,5,Seinfeld,15,2
16544,Kramer,84," Well, after he heckled Toby, she got so upset, she ran out of         the building and a street sweeper ran over her foot and severed her pinky         toe.",5,Seinfeld,157,28
16545,George,84, That's unbelievable!,5,Seinfeld,21,2
16546,Kramer,84," Yeah! Then after the ambulance left, I found the toe! So I put         it in a Cracker Jack box, filled it with ice, and took off for the hospital.",5,Seinfeld,148,29
16547,George,84, You ran?,5,Seinfeld,9,2
16548,Kramer,84," No, I jumped on the bus. I told the driver, ""I got a toe         here, buddy - step on it.""",5,Seinfeld,92,20
16549,George,84, Holy cow!,5,Seinfeld,10,2
16550,Kramer,84," Yeah, yeah, then all of a sudden, this guy pulls out a gun. Well,         I knew any delay is gonna cost her her pinky toe, so I got out of the         seat and I started walking towards him. He says, ""Where do you think         you're going, Cracker Jack?"" I said, ""Well, I got a little prize         for ya, buddy - "" <Kramer throws two quick punches and a massive         uppercut> - knocked him out cold!",5,Seinfeld,409,75
16551,George,84, How could you do that?!,5,Seinfeld,24,5
16552,Kramer,84," Then everybody is screamin,' because the driver, he's passed         out from all the commotion...the bus is out of control! So, I grab him         by the collar, I take him out of the seat, I get behind the wheel and         now I'm drivin' the bus.",5,Seinfeld,251,44
16553,George,84, You're Batman.,5,Seinfeld,15,2
16554,Kramer,84," Yeah. Yeah, I am Batman. Then the mugger, he comes to, and he         starts chokin' me! So I'm fightin' him off with one hand and I kept drivin'         the bus with the other, y'know? Then I managed to open up the door, and         I kicked him out the door with my foot, you know - at the next stop.",5,Seinfeld,303,59
16555,Jerry,84, You kept makin' all the stops?,5,Seinfeld,31,6
16556,Kramer,84," Well, people kept ringin' the bell!",5,Seinfeld,36,6
16557,George,84," Well, what about the toe? What happened to the toe?",5,Seinfeld,52,10
16558,Kramer,84, Well! I am happy to say that the little guy is back in place         at the end of the line.,5,Seinfeld,93,20
16559,George,84, You did all this...for a pinky toe?,5,Seinfeld,36,7
16560,Kramer,84," Well, it's a valuable appendage.",5,Seinfeld,33,5
16562,Elaine,84, Really.,5,Seinfeld,8,1
16569,Jerry,84, She got the promotion?,5,Seinfeld,23,4
16571,Jerry,84, Why?,5,Seinfeld,5,1
16572,Elaine,84," I'll tell ya why. Because of her pinky toe, that's why. Because         Lippman felt so sorry for her, he didn't want to hurt her feelings.",5,Seinfeld,140,25
16573,Jerry,84, Too bad.,5,Seinfeld,9,2
16574,Elaine,84," Sure, the pinky toe is cute! But, I mean, what is it? It's useless!         It does nothing. It's got that little nail that is just impossible to         cut. What do we need it for?",5,Seinfeld,183,34
16575,Jerry,84," Because Elaine, that's the one that goes 'wee-wee-wee all the         home.'",5,Seinfeld,77,11
16576,Elaine,84, Why don't you just shut the f-,5,Seinfeld,31,7
16578,Elaine,84," Yes, I heard, Kramer - I work there, remember??",5,Seinfeld,48,9
16579,Kramer,84," Yeah, and you know what she told me? She said her first order         of business is to put my coffee table book into the bookstores as soon         as possible.",5,Seinfeld,162,29
16580,Elaine,84," Oh, wonderful!",5,Seinfeld,15,2

17216,George,87, I can't believe you're not playing in cotton.,6,Seinfeld,46,8

17244,Jerry,87, I was almost Mr. Coffee. They felt I was a little too relaxed.         <Miss Rhode Island laughs.>,6,Seinfeld,99,17
17245,George,87, Miss Rhode Island? When are you seeing her?,6,Seinfeld,44,8
17246,Jerry,87," Tonight. I have to call her, she's staying in a hotel.",6,Seinfeld,55,11
17247,George,87, You're incredible.,6,Seinfeld,19,2

17260,Jerry,87," Of course, they're polyester.",6,Seinfeld,30,4
17261,George,87," Well, what is that? That's a crime! Do you know how hot those         things get? They should be wearing cotton.",6,Seinfeld,113,20
17262,Jerry,87, Why do they wear polyester?,6,Seinfeld,28,5
17263,George,87, I don't know. That's all gonna change.,6,Seinfeld,39,7
17264,Jerry,87, You're going to do something about it?,6,Seinfeld,39,7
17265,George,87, Why shouldn't I?,6,Seinfeld,17,3
17270,Elaine,87," Well, you know, grace is a tough one. I like to think I have         a little grace...not as much as Jackie - ",6,Seinfeld,111,22

17287,Elaine,87, Nothing. <Mr. Pitt comes in with some papers in hand.>,6,Seinfeld,55,10
17291,Elaine,87, I was a great admirer of Mrs. Onass-sis-sis-sis...,6,Seinfeld,51,8
17292,Jerry,87," Hello, Karen? It's Jerry Seinfeld. Oh, that's very sweet of you.         You know, you better be careful, you don't want to get too congenial.         They'll slap that ""Miss Congeniality"" on you, and you'll congene         yourself right out of the contest. So, what time do you want to get together         later? What? So what, we don't need the chaperone.  The chaperone         can't make it.  Oh, you're not gonna get disqualified! So, we're         not going? <Kramer enters.> Hold on one second.  Hey,         what are you doing tonight?",6,Seinfeld,546,85
17293,Kramer,87, Nothin.',6,Seinfeld,9,1

17296,Jerry,87, Rhode Island.,6,Seinfeld,14,2
17297,Kramer,87, They're never in contention.,6,Seinfeld,29,4
17298,George,87, How do you know?,6,Seinfeld,17,4
17299,Kramer,87, Because I've seen every Miss America pageant since I was six.       ,6,Seinfeld,69,11

17314,George,87," Hey, Buck. Talk to you for a second?",6,Seinfeld,37,8
17316,George,87, How's everything going? Everything O.K.?,6,Seinfeld,41,5
17318,George,87," Listen, Buck, I uh...obviously I don't need to talk to you about         the importance of player morale, but uh...I've been talking to some of         the guys, and some of them - I don't want to mention any names - but some         of them...they're not too happy with the polyester uniforms.",6,Seinfeld,295,50
17320,George,87," Well, they get very hot in the polyester. You know, it's not         a natural fibre. I think they would prefer cotton.",6,Seinfeld,120,21
17322,George,87," Yeah. Cotton breathes, you see, it's much softer. Imagine playing         games and your team is five degrees cooler than the other team. Don't         you think that would be an advantage? They're cooler, they're more comfortable...they're         happier - they're gonna play better.",6,Seinfeld,286,41
17324,George,87, Oh - I've got something.,6,Seinfeld,25,5
17326,Jerry,87, Congratulations!,6,Seinfeld,17,1
17327,Elaine,87," Yeah! And the best part is, I still get to look for work in publishing.",6,Seinfeld,72,15

17329,Elaine,87, I attend to his personal affairs. ,6,Seinfeld,35,6

17332,Jerry,87, Really! Socks!,6,Seinfeld,15,2
17333,Elaine,87, Yeah. White ones. Like the ones you wear with sneakers.,6,Seinfeld,56,10
17334,Jerry,87," Hey, maybe you can pick me up some underwear! <Kramer enters.>",6,Seinfeld,63,11

17337,Kramer,87, No way!,6,Seinfeld,8,2
17338,Jerry,87, What?,6,Seinfeld,6,1

17340,Jerry,87," I'm not going to ""defile"" her!",6,Seinfeld,31,6
17341,Kramer,87," That's right, because I'm going to see it doesn't happen. Look,         Jerry, these girls are Miss America contestants. It's every little girl's         dream. And I'm not going to let you trample that dream and make a mockery         of everything the pageant stands for. ",6,Seinfeld,275,43

17344,Jerry,87, But wait a minute...,6,Seinfeld,21,4
17345,Kramer,87," Now, if you want to go out and have some good, wholesome fun         with a nice girl, I'd be glad to help you out...if you're looking for         something more than that, you've got the wrong guy, buddy! <Jerry tries         to get a word in during this entire speech, but Kramer won't budge an         inch.>",6,Seinfeld,312,54
17346,Kramer,87," If you were Miss America, what would you do to make the world         a better place?",6,Seinfeld,86,16
17348,Jerry,87, That's a hell of a plan.  Listen - ,6,Seinfeld,36,8
17350,Jerry,87," Alright, Kramer!",6,Seinfeld,17,2
17351,Kramer,87," This is important stuff! She's got to be able to answer these         questions. She's not going to have time to think, out there, with millions         of people watching her. Any hesitation could cost her the crown. You know,         poise counts.",6,Seinfeld,250,40
17353,Kramer,87," Oh yeah, like last year? Miss Texas? Now, she should have won         easily, but she lost points in the swimsuit competition.",6,Seinfeld,127,21
17355,Kramer,87, Tape her breasts together. <Jerry is shocked.>,6,Seinfeld,47,7
17357,Kramer,87," Well, take you for example. Now, you're very attractive, but         you got a big waist.",6,Seinfeld,90,15
17358,Jerry,87," Hey, come on!",6,Seinfeld,14,3
17360,Kramer,87," Well, I'd recommend a waist cincher. ",6,Seinfeld,38,6
17362,Kramer,87," Oh, yeah. Just - thip! - suck you in.",6,Seinfeld,38,9
17363,Jerry,87, I'll be right back. <Leaves the table.>,6,Seinfeld,40,7
17364,Kramer,87," So, what's your talent?",6,Seinfeld,24,4
17366,Kramer,87, Mmm. I'm thinking of a number from one to ten.,6,Seinfeld,47,10

17391,Jerry,87," Yes, I poo-poo.",6,Seinfeld,16,3

17393,Jerry,87, I don't want to stop her!,6,Seinfeld,26,6

17405,Elaine,87," So, what do you think?",6,Seinfeld,23,5
17407,Elaine,87, You don't like them?,6,Seinfeld,21,4
17409,Elaine,87, What's wrong?,6,Seinfeld,14,2
17411,Elaine,87, Too tight?,6,Seinfeld,11,2

17424,Jerry,87," Today, right now! Are you in?",6,Seinfeld,30,6
17425,Elaine,87," One second, hang on.  Excuse me, Mr. Pitt? Would         it be alright if I got you the socks tomorrow?",6,Seinfeld,104,19

17435,Elaine,87, I gotta go. <Hangs up.>,6,Seinfeld,24,5
17436,Kramer,87," No. Alright, watch me now. <Karen sits on the bed. Kramer         walks across the room like a Miss America contestant with a big smile         on his face.> Turn, back, head up, shoulders back...posture. You see?         Posture.",6,Seinfeld,231,36
17438,Kramer,87," Let's try a few more questions, alright? <Karen stands up.>         If you were Miss America, and the U.S. was on the brink of a nuclear war,         and the only way the conflict could be averted was if you agreed to sleep         with the enemy's leader, what would you do?",6,Seinfeld,276,49
17440,Kramer,87," Yes, they're important! If you stumble, if you hesitate, you         can kiss the crown goodbye. Now if I've told you once, I've told you a         thousand times - poise counts!

17446,Jerry,87," Yeah, all she had to do was buy Mr. Pitt a pair of socks!",6,Seinfeld,58,14
17448,Elaine,87, But what??,6,Seinfeld,11,2
17452,Elaine,87, But that's why I got you the tighter ones! <Holds them up.>,6,Seinfeld,60,12

17456,Jerry,87, What the hell is that?,6,Seinfeld,23,5
17457,George,87," I don't know, it sounds like pigeons or something!",6,Seinfeld,51,9
17459,George,87, Me either. Is there anything you can do to shut them up?,6,Seinfeld,57,12
17460,Jerry,87," Wait a second. <Grabs the icebucket off the counter.> This'll         scare 'em off. <Dumps the bucket of water over the balcony. We hear         a loud squawking noise and the flapping of wings, then the noise is gone.         Jerry gets back into bed.> Well, good night, Ollie.",6,Seinfeld,280,46
17461,George,87," Good night, Stan.",6,Seinfeld,18,3
17462,Kramer,87, What is it?,6,Seinfeld,12,3
17464,Kramer,87, How did this happen?,6,Seinfeld,21,4
17468,Kramer,87, Accident? This was no accident. These doves were murdered.,6,Seinfeld,59,9
17469,Kramer,87," Well, that's it! She's out of the pageant!",6,Seinfeld,43,8
17470,Jerry,87, What? Why? What happened?,6,Seinfeld,26,4
17471,Kramer,87, Her birds are dead.,6,Seinfeld,20,4
17472,Jerry,87, Birds?,6,Seinfeld,7,1
17473,Kramer,87," Yeah, birds. She's got these trained doves, she does this magic         act, that was her talent for the pageant. You know what I think, Jerry?         I think somebody murdered those doves. Somebody wanted her out of that         contest bad. Somebody who was just eaten up with jealousy. Somebody who         just couldn't stand to have the spotlight taken off of them! <Kramer         turns around and notices the empty icebucket on the edge of Jerry's balcony.>",6,Seinfeld,466,74
17474,Jerry,87," What are you looking at? <Kramer goes out onto the terrace         and looks down.> Oh, that! We had to leave that outside, last night,         because the water was making the room too cold.",6,Seinfeld,192,33
17476,Jerry,87," No, you don't understand - it's not what you think! It was an         accident!",6,Seinfeld,80,14
17477,Kramer,87," Well, don't think you've won, because you haven't! This kid is         a fighter! And if you think I'm gonna let a couple of dead birds get in         our way, you're crazy!",6,Seinfeld,174,31
17478,Jerry,87," Kramer, you gotta explain to her what happened...! <Kramer         exits.>",6,Seinfeld,75,10
17480,Jerry,87," Oh, it was just Kramer...apparently I killed Miss Rhode Island's         doves with a bucket of water last night.",6,Seinfeld,114,18
17481,George,87, Oh. <Goes back into the bathroom.>,6,Seinfeld,35,6
17483,Kramer,87, How ya feelin'?,6,Seinfeld,16,3
17485,Kramer,87, There's nothing to be nervous about.,6,Seinfeld,37,6
17488,Jerry,87, I heard those doves were really incredible. ,6,Seinfeld,45,7
17489,George,87, That's a shame. <Karen is shown singing off-key on the television.>,6,Seinfeld,68,11
17490,Jerry,87, It's like watching an animal get tortured.,6,Seinfeld,43,7
17491,George,87," Hey, hey! Yankee game! <Changes the channel.>",6,Seinfeld,46,7
17492,Jerry,87," Oh, great! Alright. <We hear the announcers calling the game.>",6,Seinfeld,63,10

17519,Elaine,88, I think he's got ideas. ,6,Seinfeld,25,5
17520,Jerry,88, I wonder if any woman ever said that about Einstein?,6,Seinfeld,53,10
17521,Jerry,88, Call me when the pencil comes in Okay?,6,Seinfeld,39,8
17522,Elaine,88," Just call me when the new pen comes in, okay?",6,Seinfeld,46,10
17523,Jerry,88, Why does Mr. Pitt prefer a pencil to a pen anyway? Hey. Look who's         here.,6,Seinfeld,81,15
17524,George,88," Hey, hey.",6,Seinfeld,10,2

17544,Elaine,88, They have a big salad.,6,Seinfeld,23,5
17545,George,88, Is that what I ask for? The BIG salad?,6,Seinfeld,39,9
17546,Elaine,88," It's okay, you don't",6,Seinfeld,22,4
17547,George,88," No, no, Hey I'll get it. What's in the BIG salad?",6,Seinfeld,50,11
17548,Jerry,88," Big lettuce, big carrots, tomatoes like volleyballs.",6,Seinfeld,53,7
17549,George,88," , we'll see you in a little while.",6,Seinfeld,35,8
17550,Elaine,88, Maybe I should just get married.,6,Seinfeld,33,6
17551,Jerry,88, Dating is really starting to get embarrassing isn't it?,6,Seinfeld,56,9
17552,Elaine,88," I know. You know, whenever I'm on a date I feel people can tell.",6,Seinfeld,65,14
17553,Jerry,88, People on dates shouldn't even be allowed out in public.,6,Seinfeld,57,10
17554,Elaine,88, You can say that again.,6,Seinfeld,24,5
17555,Jerry,88," It's embarrassing for them. It's painful for us to watch. I'm         going out with someone later, I'm not even taking her out of the house.",6,Seinfeld,142,25
17556,Elaine,88, Good for you.,6,Seinfeld,14,3
17557,Jerry,88, I don't need a bunch of people staring at us.,6,Seinfeld,46,10
17558,Elaine,88, Right on baby. ,6,Seinfeld,16,3
17559,Jerry,88, What was that?,6,Seinfeld,15,3

17563,Elaine,88," Oh, how did you end up playing golf with him?",6,Seinfeld,46,10
17564,Kramer,88," Well, I met him on the course a couple of years ago. Yeah. Played         with him a lot. But today was it! We're on the fifteenth hole, ya, he's         beating me by a couple of strokes. Then, he's about to hit his second         shot, when, he picks up the ball and CLEANS it.",6,Seinfeld,280,53
17565,Elaine,88, So what?,6,Seinfeld,9,2
17566,Kramer,88," Umph, sorry! But the rules clearly state that you cannot clean         the ball unless it's on the green. The rules are very clear about that.       ",6,Seinfeld,150,25
17567,Jerry,88, Certainly are. ,6,Seinfeld,16,2
17568,Kramer,88," Ya, so I penalized him a stroke. ",6,Seinfeld,34,7
17569,Kramer,88, He LOST IT! We almost came to blows. We were face to face like         a manager and an umpire like this . . kara a pukka ba ya ka ba . . . ,6,Seinfeld,141,33
17570,Jerry,88, All right. You're in MY face.,6,Seinfeld,30,6
17571,Elaine,88, I still don't see what the big deal is. ,6,Seinfeld,41,9
17572,Kramer,88, A rule is a rule. And let's face it. Without rules there's chaos.       ,6,Seinfeld,73,13
17574,George,88," Oh, Sapphire. Uh ha ",6,Seinfeld,21,4
17576,George,88, He can be pedantic. He can be pedantic.,6,Seinfeld,40,8
17578,George,88," Yes. Yes. You know what's interesting. The quarterback for the         Atlanta Falcons is Bobby Hebert. No ""r"" which I find fascinating.         You know it's Herbert h-e-r-b-e-r-t, Hebert h-e-b-e-r-t. ""Hebert""         it's a fun name to pronounce. Try and say it Hebert. Take a shot. All         right.  All right. I ",6,Seinfeld,319,48
17580,George,88," No, Julie, Julie, don't insult me. You know, what difference         does it make who pays for lunch. It's totally meaningless. ",6,Seinfeld,129,20
17584,Jerry,88,"  Hello. No she's not here. Okay, fine, whatever. I'll         tell her. Okay. Goodbye. The stationery store guy called to say he ORDERED         your pencil. ",6,Seinfeld,159,24
17585,Elaine,88, I told ya'. He has ideas.,6,Seinfeld,26,6
17586,Jerry,88, He doesn't even care if a man answers.,6,Seinfeld,39,8
17587,Elaine,88, Or you.,6,Seinfeld,8,2
17588,George,88," Hey, hey.",6,Seinfeld,10,2
17589,Elaine,88, Hey.,6,Seinfeld,5,1
17591,Elaine,88, No problem.,6,Seinfeld,12,2
17593,Elaine,88," Thank you, Julie.",6,Seinfeld,18,3
17595,George,88," No, you go Guggenheim. I'm not much of a Guggenheim.",6,Seinfeld,53,10
17597,George,88," Ya, you go. ",6,Seinfeld,13,3
17599,Jerry,88, Bye bye,6,Seinfeld,8,2
17600,George,88, Did you see what just happened?,6,Seinfeld,32,6
17601,Jerry,88," Well, that all depends. . . ",6,Seinfeld,29,6
17602,George,88, Did you happen to notice that Julie handed the big salad to Elaine?,6,Seinfeld,68,13
17603,Jerry,88," Yeah, so?",6,Seinfeld,10,2
17604,George,88," Well, she didn't BUY the big salad. I bought the big salad. ",6,Seinfeld,61,12
17605,Jerry,88, Is that a fact?,6,Seinfeld,16,4
17606,George,88, Yes it is. She just took credit for my salad. That's not right.,6,Seinfeld,64,13
17607,Jerry,88, No it isn't. ,6,Seinfeld,14,3
17608,George,88, I mean I'm the one who bought it. ,6,Seinfeld,35,8
17609,Jerry,88, Yes you did.,6,Seinfeld,13,3
17610,George,88, You think she should have said something?,6,Seinfeld,42,7
17611,Jerry,88, She could have.,6,Seinfeld,16,3
17612,George,88," Oh, I know.",6,Seinfeld,12,3
17613,Jerry,88," Imagine, her taking credit for your big salad. ",6,Seinfeld,48,8
17614,George,88, You know you buy a big salad for somebody it would be nice if         they knew it. ,6,Seinfeld,85,17
17615,Jerry,88, Obviously.,6,Seinfeld,11,1
17616,Kramer,88, Turn on the TV.,6,Seinfeld,16,4
17617,Jerry,88, What?,6,Seinfeld,6,1
17618,Kramer,88, I'm puttin it on,6,Seinfeld,18,4
17620,Kramer,88," Yeah, but maybe he was so mad from the penalty stroke that he         murdered the dry cleaner.",6,Seinfeld,96,17
17621,Jerry,88," Well, generally speaking you don't need any extra incentive to         murder a dry cleaner. I wouldn't worry about that. ",6,Seinfeld,123,19
17622,Elaine,88, I like Julie. She's very personable.,6,Seinfeld,37,6
17623,George,88," Yeah, she's very lovely.",6,Seinfeld,25,4
17624,Elaine,88, That's great George. ,6,Seinfeld,22,3
17625,George,88, So did you enjoy your lunch?,6,Seinfeld,29,6
17626,Elaine,88," Yeah, A big salad. Very good. Actually it was too big. Ha ha         ha Wht?",6,Seinfeld,77,15
17627,George,88," oh, . . .because she handed you the bag. I could have handed         you the bag. She happened to pick it up at the restaurant even though,         . . . ",6,Seinfeld,155,30
17628,Elaine,88, Even though what?,6,Seinfeld,18,3
17629,George,88," . . . naw, it's just you thanked HER, and and oh, . . . what's         the difference?",6,Seinfeld,87,18
17630,Elaine,88," What? What are you trying to say, George?",6,Seinfeld,42,8
17631,George,88, It's just that I was the one who actually paid for the big salad.         She just happened to hand it to you. But it's no big deal. ,6,Seinfeld,134,27
17632,Elaine,88," You want the money for the big salad, George?",6,Seinfeld,46,9
17633,George,88," No, no,",6,Seinfeld,8,2
17634,Elaine,88, What is the problem?,6,Seinfeld,21,4
17635,George,88, There is no problem. . . just a small miscommunication. Whereby         you thanked her instead of the person actually responsible for purchasing         the big salad.,6,Seinfeld,169,25
17636,Jerry,88, And Kramer thinks a penalty stroke may have driven him to it.,6,Seinfeld,62,12
17638,Jerry,88," Ah, no , I don't think so.",6,Seinfeld,27,7
17640,Jerry,88, We don't need a bunch of people staring at us.,6,Seinfeld,47,10
17641,Jerry,88," Hello. No she's not here. Yes I will tell her. No I don't know         what time she might be coming back. Look I gotta' go. Goodbye. . . . That,         that's a long story. ",6,Seinfeld,176,34
17642,Jerry,88, Hello Newman.,6,Seinfeld,14,2
17644,Jerry,88," No, no I don't. Why?",6,Seinfeld,21,5
17646,Jerry,88, I suppose.,6,Seinfeld,11,2
17648,Jerry,88, I don't know. Nothing.? ,6,Seinfeld,25,4
17651,Jerry,88, You two know each other?,6,Seinfeld,25,5
17655,Jerry,88, . . . YOU went out with . . . Newman?,6,Seinfeld,38,11
17657,Jerry,88, Why?,6,Seinfeld,5,1
17659,Jerry,88," You liked, Newman?",6,Seinfeld,19,3
17661,Jerry,88," No, I'm sorry. I'm just a little curious. I mean why did you stop         seeing him. ",6,Seinfeld,87,16
17663,Jerry,88, . . . HE ended it? ,6,Seinfeld,20,6
17665,Jerry,88," No, no of course not. ",6,Seinfeld,23,5
17666,Kramer,88," Jerry, Jerry they found a tee. ",6,Seinfeld,32,6
17667,Jerry,88, What tee?,6,Seinfeld,10,2
17668,Kramer,88, A golf tee. In the dry cleaner.,6,Seinfeld,32,7
17669,Jerry,88, Newman! She went out with Newman!,6,Seinfeld,34,6
17670,Elaine,88, It must be a mistake.,6,Seinfeld,22,5
17671,Jerry,88," No. It isn't and the most distressing part of it is, not that         she went out with him but that HE stopped seeing her. Do you understand?         He, Newman; Newman stopped seeing her. Newman never stopped seeing anybody.         Newman will see whoever is willing to see him. Not so much why she did         see him as disturbing as that is. But why, did HE, Newman, stop seeing         her? ",6,Seinfeld,399,68
17672,Elaine,88, Perhaps there's more to him than meets the eye. ,6,Seinfeld,49,9
17673,Jerry,88," No, there's less. ",6,Seinfeld,19,3
17674,Elaine,88, It's possible.,6,Seinfeld,15,2
17675,Jerry,88, No it isn't. I've looked into his eyes. He's pure evil. ,6,Seinfeld,57,11
17676,Elaine,88," He's an enigma, a mystery wrapped in a riddle. ",6,Seinfeld,48,9
17677,Jerry,88," Yeah, he's a mystery wrapped in a Twinkie.",6,Seinfeld,43,8
17679,Jerry,88," No,, but thank you. ",6,Seinfeld,21,4
17680,Jerry,88," Oh, by the way, your stationery store guy called and he's got         your pencil. ",6,Seinfeld,84,14
17681,Elaine,88, Ugh! You are kidding me. ,6,Seinfeld,26,5
17682,Jerry,88," No, he left the store early, made a special trip to the distributor         and got it. ",6,Seinfeld,89,16
17683,Elaine,88, I bought mine yesterday on 14th Street. ,6,Seinfeld,41,7
17684,Jerry,88," Well, what did you do that for? You ordered it.",6,Seinfeld,48,10
17685,Elaine,88, To please Mr. Pitt. ,6,Seinfeld,21,4
17686,Jerry,88," Well, you better go down there and tell this guy. He's very excited.       ",6,Seinfeld,76,13
17687,Elaine,88," Uh, great!",6,Seinfeld,11,2
17688,Jerry,88, Hi Julie.,6,Seinfeld,10,2
17689,Jerry,88, Hi. ,6,Seinfeld,5,1
17690,Elaine,88, Hi Julie.,6,Seinfeld,10,2
17691,Jerry,88," Hi, how are you, Elaine? I'm meeting George here. ",6,Seinfeld,51,9
17692,Elaine,88," Oh, well then I better get going otherwise George will make me         buy him lunch to make up for that big salad he bought me yesterday. ",6,Seinfeld,140,26
17693,Jerry,88, How do you know THAT?,6,Seinfeld,22,5
17695,Jerry,88, It's Jerry.,6,Seinfeld,12,2
17697,Jerry,88, Come on Newman. OPEN THE DOOR!,6,Seinfeld,31,6
17699,Jerry,88," Okay, pudgy, lets stop playing games. What happened with margaret?",6,Seinfeld,67,10
17701,Jerry,88," No, we can't. My skin is crawling just being inside your little         rat's nest. Now, what happened?",6,Seinfeld,104,17
17703,Jerry,88, Noit your type? ,6,Seinfeld,17,3
17705,Jerry,88," Well, how come? ",6,Seinfeld,17,3
17707,Jerry,88," What, what is wrong with her? ",6,Seinfeld,31,6
17709,Jerry,88, You don't think she's attractive?,6,Seinfeld,34,5
17711,Jerry,88," Okay, Newman, thanks a lot. ",6,Seinfeld,29,5
17713,Jerry,88," No, thank you. ",6,Seinfeld,16,3
17715,Kramer,88," Listen to this, ""If a player cleans his ball during the         play of a hole accept on the putting green he shall incur a penalty of         one stroke. "" That's a rule, Jerry.",6,Seinfeld,179,33
17716,Jerry,88, But it's just a friendly game. Why do you have to be such a stickler?,6,Seinfeld,70,15
17717,Kramer,88," Because that's the way I weas raised. You know when I was growing         up I had to be in bed every night by nine o'clock. And if I wasn't, well         I don't have to tell you what happened. ",6,Seinfeld,196,38
17718,Jerry,88, What are you so worried about this for?,6,Seinfeld,40,8
17719,Kramer,88, You know he talked about Pinkus on the course? ,6,Seinfeld,48,9
17720,Jerry,88, He did?,6,Seinfeld,8,2
17721,Kramer,88," Oh yeah, he said he brought a pair of pants into Pinkus' and         they came back stained with some kind of dry cleaning fluid. And Pinkus         denied responsibility. You see he was very upset with Pinkus. ",6,Seinfeld,212,36
17722,Jerry,88, So it had nothing to do with you. ,6,Seinfeld,35,8
17723,Kramer,88," Yeah, but maybe I pushed him over the edge. ",6,Seinfeld,45,9
17724,Jerry,88," No, I don't think so. ",6,Seinfeld,23,5
17725,Kramer,88," Poor Pinkus, poor little Pinkus.",6,Seinfeld,33,5
17726,Jerry,88," Hey, let me ask you a question. You met margaret. Doo you think         Margaret's good looking? Um, she's a natural beauty. Oh, no makeup. I         like that. ",6,Seinfeld,162,27
17727,Jerry,88," Yeah, and the curls. You like the curls?",6,Seinfeld,41,8
17728,Kramer,88," Oh, I love curls.",6,Seinfeld,18,4

It's a lovely tribute to our past president,         by the way. It's not bad enough Lincoln got shot in the head, we gotta         pull down our pants and sit on him, too. It's just incomprehensible that         you would buy a thing like this, you install it on your toilet seat, and         this says what about you? ""Well, I can't afford to just throw money         down the toilet, but look how close I am!""",6,Seinfeld,592,104

18131,Jerry,96, I never did. In four years of high school I would never race anyone         again. Not even to the end of the block to catch a bus. And so the legend         grew. Everyone wanted me to race. They begged me. The track coach called         my parents. Pleading. Telling them it was a sin to waste my god given         talent. But I answered him in the same way I answered everyone. I chose         not to run. ,6,Seinfeld,410,75

18873,Elaine,102, That is *so* stupid. Why don't you just confess?,6,Seinfeld,49,9

21495,Jerry,113, Maybe they offered him a chair and he turned it down.,7,Seinfeld,54,11
21496,George,113, Would you get out of here. Who's gonna turn down a chair?               I would be,7,Seinfeld,83,15

21636,George,113, Huh. Your renting a house in Tuscany?,7,Seinfeld,38,7
21637,Jerry,113, No.,7,Seinfeld,4,1
21638,George,113, So what do you care?,7,Seinfeld,21,5
21640,Jerry,113, I just wish I could figure out if this guy is trying to               keep me out of ,7,Seinfeld,86,17
21641,George,113, Of course he is. There's got to be houses for rent in Tuscany.               Do you ,7,Seinfeld,85,15
21642,Jerry,113, I have no idea.,7,Seinfeld,16,4
21643,George,113, It it's huge. It's probably like North Dakota.,7,Seinfeld,47,8
21644,Jerry,113," Oh, no way it's that big.",7,Seinfeld,26,6
21645,George,113, It's a big region.,7,Seinfeld,19,4
21646,Jerry,113, Do you know how big North Dakota is stupid?,7,Seinfeld,44,9
21647,George,113, I don't know why I bother even talking to you.,7,Seinfeld,47,10
21648,Jerry,113," Hey, no one's got a gun to your head.",7,Seinfeld,38,9

21651,Jerry,113, Yeah and?,7,Seinfeld,10,2
21652,George,113," Well it's tough to get a good read but I think if I brought               him a chair,",7,Seinfeld,87,17
21653,Jerry,113, So are you gonna get him a chair?,7,Seinfeld,34,8
21654,George,113, Yup. It's really just a question of what kind. Thinking               about a bar stool.,7,Seinfeld,89,14
21655,Jerry,113," Yeah, that would give him some height, be able to check               things out. With a",7,Seinfeld,89,15
21656,George,113, Oh I think I'd go for the back.,7,Seinfeld,32,8
21657,Jerry,113, Swivel?,7,Seinfeld,8,1
21658,George,113, I suppose he could swivel. Hey maybe one of those director's               chairs. What,7,Seinfeld,88,13
21659,Jerry,113, I thinks it's kind of a pompous look. You know my parents               used to have a ,7,Seinfeld,88,16
21660,George,113, You mean one of those vinyl things?,7,Seinfeld,36,7

21662,George,113," Vinyl yeah, maybe.",7,Seinfeld,19,3
21663,Jerry,113, How can I figure out if there's any places to rent in Tuscany?               Wait a ,7,Seinfeld,85,15
21664,George,113," Yeah, good luck. Hey I'll meet you outside.",7,Seinfeld,44,8

21668,George,113, What do you think about a rocking chair?,7,Seinfeld,41,8
21669,Kramer,113,"  You can't put a limit               on my cafe lattes,",7,Seinfeld,56,9
21670,Jerry,113," Hey hey hey, slow down Eddie. What what's the matter?",7,Seinfeld,54,10
21671,Kramer,113, Awe there making faces at me cause I've had a couple of               cafe lattes. But I'm,7,Seinfeld,91,16
21672,Jerry,113, That's it?,7,Seinfeld,11,2
21673,Kramer,113, That's it. What you want one George? I can get one for               you. No problem.,7,Seinfeld,86,15

21687,George,113, I'm engaged to Mr. Ross' niece. I'm probably gonna be taking               over this ,7,Seinfeld,86,13
21689,George,113, Innocent mistake.,7,Seinfeld,18,2
21690,George,113," Well, here you go. What do you think?",7,Seinfeld,38,8
21692,George,113," Hey, I'm his nephew, all right? Don't worry about it. Go               ahead. Check it out.",7,Seinfeld,92,15
21695,Jerry,113," Ah, excuse me, I'm looking for a Mr. Giggio.",7,Seinfeld,45,9
21697,Jerry,113, Poppy sent me to see you Mr. Giggio.,7,Seinfeld,37,8
21699,Jerry,113," Um, did he did he mention to you why I called?",7,Seinfeld,47,11
21701,Jerry,113," Yeah, right, right. So is there anything there to rent?",7,Seinfeld,56,10
21703,Jerry,113, I didn't actually want to rent it.,7,Seinfeld,35,7
21706,Jerry,113," So see um, I didn't say that I wanted to rent it, I was               just wondering if",7,Seinfeld,88,17
21710,Elaine,113," It's been a rough couple of weeks, ya know I really needed               to get away.",7,Seinfeld,86,15
21712,Elaine,113, You're right Maestro.,7,Seinfeld,22,3
21713,Kramer,113," Common Jerry, this guy is crazy. Get out.",7,Seinfeld,42,8
21714,Jerry,113, You didn't have to push me.,7,Seinfeld,28,6

21716,Jerry,113," 75,000 lira.",7,Seinfeld,13,2
21717,Kramer,113," 75,000 lira? Are you out of your mind?",7,Seinfeld,39,8
21718,Jerry,113, Kramer you don't under the conversion rate.,7,Seinfeld,44,7
21719,Kramer,113," Oh, conversion rate, oh.",7,Seinfeld,25,4
21720,Jerry,113, You know I don't even know why I brought you.,7,Seinfeld,46,10
21721,Kramer,113, Nobody put a gun to your head.,7,Seinfeld,31,7
21722,Jerry,113, Not bad!,7,Seinfeld,9,2
21723,Kramer,113, Yeah!,7,Seinfeld,6,1
21727,Elaine,114, Hello,7,Seinfeld,6,1
21728,Elaine,114," Oh, god. OH, I could use a few more hours sleep.",7,Seinfeld,49,11
21730,Elaine,114, I wish.,7,Seinfeld,8,2
21732,Elaine,114," Really? Thank you., wake up service . . . person.",7,Seinfeld,50,10
21734,Elaine,114," Oh, all right, James. He he he",7,Seinfeld,31,7
21735,George,114, Your wake up guy asked you out?,7,Seinfeld,32,7
21736,Elaine,114," Yeah, I've never seen him but I feel like we have this weirdly         intimate relationship. I mean, I'm lying in bed, I'm wearing my nightie,       ",7,Seinfeld,151,25
21737,Jerry,114, I don't know. Blind date?,7,Seinfeld,26,5
21738,Elaine,114, What? You're going to go out with my cousin Holly. You've never         met her.,7,Seinfeld,81,14
21739,Jerry,114," Yeah, but I've seen pictures of her.",7,Seinfeld,37,7
21740,Elaine,114, At least I've spoken to my guy. You're going out on a deaf date.,7,Seinfeld,65,14
21741,Jerry,114, I think I'd rather go out on a deaf date than a blind date. The         question is whether you'd rather date the blind or the deaf.,7,Seinfeld,133,26
21742,Elaine,114," Ah, . . . ",7,Seinfeld,11,4
21743,George,114, Now you're off on a topic.,7,Seinfeld,27,6
21744,Jerry,114," You know, I think, I would rather date the deaf.",7,Seinfeld,49,10
21745,Elaine,114, Uh hu.,7,Seinfeld,7,2
21746,Jerry,114, Because I think the blind would probably be a little messier around         the house. And lets face it they're not going to get all the crumbs. I'd         possibly be walking around with a sponge.,7,Seinfeld,199,34
21747,George,114, You see I disagree. I'd rather be dating the blind. You know         you could let the house go. You could let yourself go. A good looking         blind woman doesn't even know you're not good enough for her. ,7,Seinfeld,210,37
21748,Elaine,114, I think she'd figure it out. ,7,Seinfeld,30,6
21749,Elaine,114, What? What is this?,7,Seinfeld,20,4
21750,Jerry,114, Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit.,7,Seinfeld,34,5
21751,Elaine,114, Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit? What are you turning into?,7,Seinfeld,61,10
21752,Jerry,114, A healthy person. ,7,Seinfeld,19,3
21753,George,114,"  Ow, Ow you squirted me.",7,Seinfeld,25,5
21754,Jerry,114," Oh, sorry",7,Seinfeld,10,2
21755,George,114," Boy, it stings.",7,Seinfeld,16,3
21757,George,114, No.,7,Seinfeld,4,1
21759,George,114," No, not that I know of. ",7,Seinfeld,25,6
21761,George,114, Morgan? No. He's doing a great job. ,7,Seinfeld,37,7
21763,Jerry,114," I still can't believe, you're going out on a blind date.",7,Seinfeld,57,11
21764,Elaine,114, I'm not worried. It sounds like he's really good looking.,7,Seinfeld,58,10
21765,Jerry,114, You're going by sound? What are we? Whales?,7,Seinfeld,44,8
21766,Elaine,114, I think I can tell.,7,Seinfeld,20,5
21767,Jerry,114," Elaine, what percentage of people would you say are good looking?",7,Seinfeld,66,11
21768,Elaine,114, Twenty-five percent.,7,Seinfeld,21,2
21769,Jerry,114," Twenty-five percent, you say? No way! It's like 4 to 6 percent.         It's a twenty to one shot.",7,Seinfeld,99,18
21770,Elaine,114, You're way off. ,7,Seinfeld,17,3
21771,Jerry,114, Way off? Have you been to the motor vehicle bureau? It's like         a leper colony down there.,7,Seinfeld,97,17
21772,Elaine,114, So what you are saying is that 90 to 95 percent of the population         is undateable?,7,Seinfeld,89,16
21773,Jerry,114, UNDATEABLE! ,7,Seinfeld,13,1
21774,Elaine,114, Then how are all these people getting together?,7,Seinfeld,48,8
21775,Jerry,114, Alcohol. ,7,Seinfeld,10,1
21776,Elaine,114,  What is your problem?,7,Seinfeld,23,4
21777,George,114, No problem here.,7,Seinfeld,17,3
21778,Elaine,114, You keep winking at me. That's really obnoxious.,7,Seinfeld,49,8
21779,George,114, I had no idea.,7,Seinfeld,15,4
21780,Elaine,114, Right there. Right there. You just did it again.,7,Seinfeld,49,9
21781,George,114, Wait a minute. Wait a minute. It's from that grapefruit that         Jerry squirted at me.,7,Seinfeld,91,15
21782,Elaine,114, You're eye still hurts?,7,Seinfeld,24,4
21783,George,114," Yeah, yeah. You must have squirted a piece of pulp in it too.",7,Seinfeld,62,13
21784,Jerry,114, Pulp couldn't make it across the table.,7,Seinfeld,40,7
21785,George,114," Pulp can move, Baby! Why didn't you eat a real breakfast?",7,Seinfeld,58,11
21786,Jerry,114," Hey, I eat healthy. If I have to take out an eye, that's the breaks.",7,Seinfeld,69,15

25716,Jerry,126, You have no idea.,7,Seinfeld,18,4

25748,Elaine,127,"  Okay..  So..  Frank, did George ever show you that photo?",7,Seinfeld,59,10
25749,George,127,  What photo?,7,Seinfeld,13,2
25750,Elaine,127," You know, the photo I took in Tuscany of the little man in front         of the sign that said ""Costanza""?",7,Seinfeld,107,20
25752,Elaine,127," I didn't talk to anyone - I was just walking by, and I saw the         sign, and I thought George might get a kick out of it.",7,Seinfeld,126,27
25754,Elaine,127, Who is that?,7,Seinfeld,13,3
25755,George,127,"          When the Costanzas came here, one brother stayed behind.",7,Seinfeld,66,9
25757,Elaine,127," So, you weren't born here?",7,Seinfeld,27,5
25759,George,127, I don't know what you're getting all riled up about. There are         probably a million Costanzas-,7,Seinfeld,101,16
25761,Elaine,127," No, I, I don't. But.. Well, the Maestro might.",7,Seinfeld,47,9
25763,Elaine,127," He's this guy that I went to Tuscany with. He's a great guy,         but I just wouldn't feel comfortable calling him.",7,Seinfeld,119,21
25764,George,127, Really? Why?,7,Seinfeld,13,2
25765,Elaine,127,  Because he hasn't called me since we got back..         I spilled wine on his 8 by 10 photo of one of his favorite Italian opera         stars.,7,Seinfeld,145,26
25766,George,127, Who?,7,Seinfeld,5,1

25769,Elaine,127,  The other guy.,7,Seinfeld,16,3
25772,Jerry,127," Uh.. well, you better not. I'm supposed to be careful with it.",7,Seinfeld,63,12
25774,Jerry,127," Oh, okay..",7,Seinfeld,11,2
25777,Jerry,127, Ohh.. look at this..,7,Seinfeld,21,4
25778,Kramer,127, What?,7,Seinfeld,6,1
25779,Jerry,127, I bought a bottle of BBQ sauce in Memphis. I think the stewardess         broke it when she tried to jam it into the overhead compartment because         of this  stupid thing.,7,Seinfeld,177,30
25780,Kramer,127," Well, don't press the panic button. I'm sure that we can still         salvage some sauce..",7,Seinfeld,92,15
25781,Jerry,127," I don't care about the sauce. It came in this funny little bottle,         and there was a guy on the label that looked exactly like Charles Grodin.",7,Seinfeld,149,27
25782,Kramer,127,  I see..,7,Seinfeld,9,2
25783,Jerry,127," No, you don't see - because I'm going on the show this week, and         this was going to be my bit on the show.",7,Seinfeld,114,24
25784,Kramer,127," Well, why don't you do your material?",7,Seinfeld,38,7
25785,Jerry,127, I'm out.,7,Seinfeld,9,2

25790,George,127, Oh yeah..  Sally called Susan - said you guys         really hit it off.,7,Seinfeld,73,13
25791,Jerry,127,  Nobody hit anything off. She just gave         me the box.  What the hell are         you doing?,7,Seinfeld,98,16
25792,Kramer,127,  I'm salvaging the sauce. What's the matter with you?         ,7,Seinfeld,63,9
25793,Jerry,127,"  Hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on.",7,Seinfeld,34,7
25794,Kramer,127,"  Jerry, why don't you do a bit         on Styrofoam?",7,Seinfeld,53,9
25795,Jerry,127, Like what?,7,Seinfeld,11,2
25796,Kramer,127," Well, uh..  ""What is         this stuff? Why do we need this stuff?.. And why do they make it so small..?""",7,Seinfeld,107,20
25797,Jerry,127,  Where's the punchline?,7,Seinfeld,24,3
25798,Kramer,127, It's all attitude.. ,7,Seinfeld,21,3
25800,Jerry,127, A door mat? That's what she had me lug up from Memphis?!,7,Seinfeld,57,12
25801,George,127," Pretty chintzy, huh? Considering the money she makes.. She's         a big executive for Federal Express.",7,Seinfeld,106,15
25802,Jerry,127, Federal Express?! Is she out of her mind? Why didn't she just         ship it?!,7,Seinfeld,80,14
25803,Kramer,127," Look, it's personalized.  ""The Costanzas""",7,Seinfeld,42,5
25804,George,127," No, no. Forget it. I don't want it. Let's just get rid of it.",7,Seinfeld,62,14
25805,Kramer,127," Well, maybe your father would be interested in that.",7,Seinfeld,53,9
25806,George,127, I doubt it. You know what he's doing now? He's putting a pool         table in my old bedroom.,7,Seinfeld,95,18
25807,Kramer,127,"  Oh yeah? Well, maybe I'll go out there and knock         a few balls around with him. You know, show him a thing or two..",7,Seinfeld,123,24
25809,Kramer,127," So, what's your game? What do you like to play?",7,Seinfeld,48,10
25811,Kramer,127," No, nothing doing. Let's, you and me, play a game of straight         pool.. hmm?",7,Seinfeld,82,14
25813,Kramer,127," Yeah, now and then - you know how it is..",7,Seinfeld,42,10
25815,Kramer,127, I'll break.,7,Seinfeld,12,2
25818,George,127, What's all this?,7,Seinfeld,17,3
25820,George,127,  More stuff..,7,Seinfeld,14,2
25822,George,127, Oh my God! What is that?!,7,Seinfeld,26,6
25824,George,127,  This doll  looks like my mother.,7,Seinfeld,34,6
25826,George,127," I know it's a doll, but it looks like my mother!",7,Seinfeld,49,11
25832,Kramer,127,"  Well, we're still, uh,         learning the subtleties of the table.",7,Seinfeld,70,10
25836,Kramer,127,  As soon as the game is over..,7,Seinfeld,31,7
25838,Kramer,127," Eleven, corner pocket. ",7,Seinfeld,24,3
25840,George,127, What is this thing doing here?,7,Seinfeld,31,6

25848,Elaine,127,  Oh yeah?,7,Seinfeld,10,2
25849,Jerry,127," Oh, it's unbelievable. Every time you use it you feel like you         just came from the dentist!",7,Seinfeld,99,17
25850,Elaine,127,"  Oh, that's dynamite.",7,Seinfeld,22,3
25851,Jerry,127," Hey, what are you doing tomorrow? You want to come see me on the         Charles Grodin show?",7,Seinfeld,94,17
25852,Elaine,127, Who else is on the show?,7,Seinfeld,25,6
25853,Jerry,127, Uh.. one of the three tenors.,7,Seinfeld,30,6
25854,Elaine,127,  The Three Tenors?  Which one?!,7,Seinfeld,32,5
25855,Jerry,127, Uh.. It's not Poverotti.. It's not Domingo..,7,Seinfeld,45,7
25856,Elaine,127,  The other guy?!,7,Seinfeld,17,3
25857,Jerry,127,"  Yeah, the other guy.",7,Seinfeld,22,4
25858,Elaine,127,  My God! I can't believe the other guy's         going to be on the show!,7,Seinfeld,74,14
25859,Jerry,127, Why?,7,Seinfeld,5,1
25860,Elaine,127, Because I ruined this autographed picture of him that belonged         to the Maestro. You think I can go and get his autograph?,7,Seinfeld,129,22
25861,Jerry,127, Why not?,7,Seinfeld,9,2
25862,Elaine,127,  Wow! The other guy!,7,Seinfeld,21,4
25863,Jerry,127," Hey, you look awful.",7,Seinfeld,21,4
25864,George,127,"  I'm on no sleep, bro.",7,Seinfeld,23,5
25865,Jerry,127, Problem in the bedroom?,7,Seinfeld,24,4

25867,Jerry,127, Wow. You were in bed with your mother last night?,7,Seinfeld,50,10
25868,George,127,"  ..Felt like it. I tell you, this doll is pretty         spooky.  It's freakin' me out         man. And now I got to go back out there and pick up this doormat.",7,Seinfeld,161,30
25869,Jerry,127, I thought you didn't want the doormat.,7,Seinfeld,39,7
25870,George,127, I don't. Susan wants to have it out when Sally comes tomorrow.,7,Seinfeld,63,12
25871,Jerry,127," Sally?  Wait, wait a minute - She's coming to New         York?",7,Seinfeld,64,11

25873,Jerry,127, Excited? I'm gonna kill her! She knew she was coming here and         she made me carry that box?!,7,Seinfeld,99,18
25874,Elaine,127, Who's Sally?,7,Seinfeld,13,2
25875,George,127, Susan's college roommate.,7,Seinfeld,26,3
25876,Jerry,127, It's because of her that bottle got broke that I was going to         give to Charles Grodin on his show.,7,Seinfeld,106,20
25877,George,127, So call her up and tell her to bring you another one. She'll         be delighted to talk to you.,7,Seinfeld,98,19
25878,Jerry,127,"  I will - don't worry.          In fact, I'll have her bring up a whole case of the stuff. It'll be really         heavy. Let's see if she likes sitting on a plane with a big box on her         lap!",7,Seinfeld,199,38
25879,Elaine,127, That's sounds pretty juvenile.,7,Seinfeld,31,4
25880,Jerry,127,  Hey! A dinosaur!,7,Seinfeld,18,3
25884,Kramer,127," Well, listen, if you bring 'em by, maybe we could interest you         in a game of pool.. Yeah, Frank here - he's got his own billiard room.",7,Seinfeld,142,27
25886,Kramer,127, A billiard room.,7,Seinfeld,17,3

25900,Jerry,127," Well, it doesn't look exactly like her.",7,Seinfeld,40,7
25901,George,127," Jerry, come on. If my mother keeps shrinking, this is exactly         what she's gonna look like in ten years!",7,Seinfeld,111,19
25902,Jerry,127, Why don't you just get rid of it?,7,Seinfeld,34,8
25903,George,127," I tried! I almost threw it down the incinerator, but I couldn't         do it. The guilt was too overwhelming.  Susan's so attached to this thing.",7,Seinfeld,147,25
25904,Jerry,127," Wait, where are you going? Don't take your dolly and go home.",7,Seinfeld,62,12
25905,George,127," Hi, Elaine.",7,Seinfeld,12,2

25916,Elaine,127," Eh, I like mine.",7,Seinfeld,17,4
25917,Jerry,127," I've had yours, I'm telling you - this one is ten times better.         Don't you believe me?",7,Seinfeld,94,17
25918,Elaine,127, I don't want it.,7,Seinfeld,17,4
25919,Jerry,127,  I don't understand this. Why         wouldn't you want to get something that's better if I'm telling you it's         better? And it's not a little better - it's much better.,7,Seinfeld,176,29
25920,Elaine,127,  It doesn't matter to me.,7,Seinfeld,26,5
25921,Jerry,127, Come in.,7,Seinfeld,9,2

25929,Jerry,127,"  No, no. I wanted the one in the little bottle with         that guy on it that looks like Charles Grodin!",7,Seinfeld,107,20
25931,Jerry,127, I know it's a joke. It's supposed to be a joke! Now I'm going         on the Charles Grodin Show with nothing.  Nothing!,7,Seinfeld,121,22
25933,Jerry,127,  I don't have any material!,7,Seinfeld,28,5

25949,Kramer,127," Alright, come on Frank. It's your shot.",7,Seinfeld,40,7

25957,Jerry,127,  That woman is such an idiot! I was gonna do         this whole bit on that bottle - and now I got nothing to talk about.,7,Seinfeld,122,25
25958,Elaine,127," Well, have you ever considered writing new material?",7,Seinfeld,53,8
25959,Jerry,127," Well, maybe if I didn't have so many people in my apartment all         the time I'd be able to get some work done.",7,Seinfeld,116,23
25960,Elaine,127,  Me? Are you talking about me?,7,Seinfeld,31,6
25961,Jerry,127,  No. You're never here.,7,Seinfeld,24,4

25973,Jerry,127,  Yes.,7,Seinfeld,6,1
25977,Kramer,127," Yeah..  See? This is no good..  Hey, the baton.  I got a hunch,         fat man, I can't miss.  13 in the side pocket.  Giddy-up.  Six in the corner.  This table's mine.          You know where it's going..",7,Seinfeld,207,36

28941,Jerry,145, What's the difference? You never showed up.,8,Seinfeld,44,7

28943,Jerry,145," Well, we barely knew the guy.",8,Seinfeld,30,6
28944,Elaine,145," So, the longer you know someone, the shorter you wait for 'em.",8,Seinfeld,63,12
28945,Jerry,145, That's the way it works.,8,Seinfeld,25,5
28946,Elaine,145, When did you tell George to be here?,8,Seinfeld,37,8
28947,Jerry,145, I told him to meet us here in ten minutes. How long has it been?,8,Seinfeld,65,15

28952,Jerry,145, How did you know about that?,8,Seinfeld,29,6

28954,Jerry,145, He can't do that.,8,Seinfeld,18,4

28963,Jerry,145, When you feel guilty.,8,Seinfeld,22,4
28964,George,145," No, occasionally I'll forget to let the machine pick up. Anyway,         they made this large donation to a women's prison, and I get to go down         there and check it out.",8,Seinfeld,177,31
28965,Kramer,145, That's caged heat.,8,Seinfeld,19,3
28966,George,145, Yeah-hah!,8,Seinfeld,10,1
28967,Jerry,145, What are you gonna do there?,8,Seinfeld,29,6
28968,George,145," Nothing really, you know...just stroll around the cell blocks,         maybe take in a shower fight.  Hey, you know you got a bounced         check hanging up in the little market over on Columbus?",8,Seinfeld,198,32
28969,Jerry,145," Yes, I know, I know.",8,Seinfeld,21,5
28970,George,145," I noticed you chose the ""clowns with balloons"" check         design.",8,Seinfeld,69,10

28973,Kramer,145," Hey, Kurt. Taste these eggs.",8,Seinfeld,29,5
28975,Kramer,145," Yes! These are sweatshop eggs. <Kramer gets up to leave by         climbing over the back of the booth. He loses it and falls on the floor,         then regains his composure and walks out with his napkin still tucked         in his collar.>",8,Seinfeld,242,41
28978,Jerry,145, Is he from the future?,8,Seinfeld,23,5
28979,Elaine,145," No, he just shaves his head. I think it's pretty gutsy.",8,Seinfeld,56,11
28980,George,145," Listen, sweetheart, let me tell you a little something about         guts. <Points to his head.> This is guts.",8,Seinfeld,111,18
28981,Elaine,145, What? Clinging to some scraps?,8,Seinfeld,31,5
28982,George,145," These are not ""scraps."" These are historic remains         of a once great society of hair.",8,Seinfeld,92,15
28983,Elaine,145," Oh, did you guys stop at the bodega today? Some moron bounced         a clown check!",8,Seinfeld,85,15

29002,George,145," Thanks, Warden.",8,Seinfeld,16,2
29006,George,145," Well, let's just say it wouldn't exist without me. <Notices         another person in the library dressed the same as Celia.> So uh, you         two shop at the same store?",8,Seinfeld,173,29
29008,George,145, Oh my God...you're in jail? <Celia nods.> That is so cool!,8,Seinfeld,59,11

29011,Jerry,145, How could you ask her out?,8,Seinfeld,27,6
29012,George,145, Why not?,8,Seinfeld,9,2
29013,Jerry,145, I remember when you wouldn't date that girl who lived in Queens         because you didn't want to go over the bridge!,8,Seinfeld,119,21
29014,George,145, That was different! ,8,Seinfeld,21,3
29015,Jerry,145, I'll say.,8,Seinfeld,10,2
29016,George,145," Jerry, I like being with her. Plus, I know where she is all the         time. I have relatively no competition. And you know how you live in fear         of the pop-in?",8,Seinfeld,169,31
29018,George,145," Yeah, no pop-in, no ""in the neighborhood,"" no ""I         saw your light was on."" And the best part is, if things go really         well...",8,Seinfeld,139,24

29028,Jerry,145," Kramer, wait a minute, what the hell is that?",8,Seinfeld,46,9

29030,Jerry,145, I sense something is afoot.,8,Seinfeld,28,5
29032,George,145, Allow me. Why?,8,Seinfeld,15,3
29033,Kramer,145," Cage-free, farm-fresh eggs.",8,Seinfeld,28,3
29034,Jerry,145," Allow me. What are you, an idiot?",8,Seinfeld,34,7
29038,Elaine,145," Your hair. It's so thick and lustrous. I mean, it...it was.",8,Seinfeld,60,11
29040,Elaine,145, Are you saying that I could be dating this hair? With you under         it? <Kurt shrugs.>,8,Seinfeld,91,16
29041,Jerry,145," Is that your ""chicken"" making all that noise?",8,Seinfeld,46,8
29042,Kramer,145," Oh, Jerry loves the morning.",8,Seinfeld,29,5

29046,Kramer,145, Of course it is. I picked it out myself.,8,Seinfeld,41,9
29047,Jerry,145," Well, you picked out a rooster.",8,Seinfeld,32,6

29050,George,145, Yeah. I had a great time.,8,Seinfeld,26,6
29052,George,145, The whole hour just flew by. <Begins cleaning up the table.>,8,Seinfeld,61,11

29081,Jerry,145, So he just shaves his head for no reason?,8,Seinfeld,42,9
29082,George,145, That's like using a wheelchair for the fun of it!,8,Seinfeld,50,10
29083,Elaine,145, And he's growing it in just for me.  It's mine. It's         all mine.,8,Seinfeld,71,13

29086,Jerry,145, It's brown.,8,Seinfeld,12,2
29087,Elaine,145, It's chestnut with auburn highlights!,8,Seinfeld,38,5
29088,Jerry,145, So?,8,Seinfeld,4,1
29089,Elaine,145," You're not around women. You don't know how important a man's         hair is. <They both look at George, who is reading a newspaper and         struggling to keep his composure.> I'm sorry, George, but it's true.",8,Seinfeld,214,35

He was peckin' and weavin' and bobbin' and talkin' trash! He didn't even         have to touch him! The other rooster ran out of the ring. The whole fight         lasted two seconds.",8,Seinfeld,330,55
29130,Jerry,145, How long do they usually last?,8,Seinfeld,31,6

29142,Jerry,145," Ah, I'm so sorry.",8,Seinfeld,18,4
29143,George,145, She's been locked up for two years. She's gonna want to make         up for lost time. Dinners. Movies. <Rubs his forehead.> Talking...,8,Seinfeld,136,22
29144,Jerry,145," In other words, a normal relationship.",8,Seinfeld,39,6
29145,George,145," And that's no good. I've tried it straight, Jerry. We've all         seen the results. For me, sick is the only way to go.",8,Seinfeld,123,23
29146,Jerry,145," Well, she'll still be an ex-con.",8,Seinfeld,33,6
29147,George,145, It's not the same. ,8,Seinfeld,20,4

29176,George,145," Plans. Schemes. She keeps talking about getting back together         with her old friends - ""the gang,"" as she likes to call them,         you know. Yeah, they're hatching something, you can count on that. ",8,Seinfeld,208,33
29178,Jerry,145, Kramer won't sell.,8,Seinfeld,19,3
29180,Jerry,145," Well, thank you, Marcelino.",8,Seinfeld,28,4

29193,George,145," No, no, Kurt - wrong attitude. You should be happy now. ",8,Seinfeld,57,11
29195,George,145, You've still got pretty good coverage. Once the enemy advances         beyond this perimeter - <points at Kurt's head with a pen> - then         you won't be Kurt anymore.,8,Seinfeld,172,28
29200,George,145," Yes. Live, dammit. Live! Every precious moment as if this was         the last year of your life. Because in many ways...it is. <There's         a knock at the door.> Excuse me.",8,Seinfeld,178,30

30266,George,155, Oh really. You tell her you shaved it?,8,Seinfeld,39,8

30292,Jerry,155," ""The Real Peterman Reality Bus Tour"". I'm confused.",8,Seinfeld,52,8

31459,Jerry,160," What happened, I thought you were with Tara tonight? ",9,Seinfeld,54,9
31460,George,160," I was, I had to leave. She lit some vanilla incenses. The smell         drove me nuts, all I could think about was food, I had to get out of there.         We need some pudding here! Pudding! ",9,Seinfeld,193,36
31461,Elaine,160, You just left? What did you tell her? ,9,Seinfeld,39,8
31462,George,160, I told I had a bus transfer that was only good just for another         hour. ,9,Seinfeld,79,15
31463,Jerry,160, What? ,9,Seinfeld,7,1
31464,George,160," I don't know, I was starving Jerry! ",9,Seinfeld,37,7
31465,George,160," Oh, pudding! You want some? ",9,Seinfeld,29,5
31466,Jerry,160," Hey, you guys think I'm getting a little...chunky? ",9,Seinfeld,52,8
31467,George,160," What are you kidding? We look great! You know what this pudding         needs? The skin on the top, you know like your mother used to make it         on the stove. ",9,Seinfeld,165,30
31468,Jerry,160," Elaine, what do you think? ",9,Seinfeld,28,5
31469,Elaine,160, I think you're getting a little pudding under the skin yourself.       ,9,Seinfeld,72,11
31470,Kramer,160," My service rates went up? You banks are all the same with your         hidden fees and your service charges. Well, maybe I'll just take my blood         elsewhere, yeah. ",9,Seinfeld,171,28
31472,Kramer,160," Oh, no no no...no more banks. I'm keeping my blood in my freezer         with...my money! ",9,Seinfeld,91,15
31473,George,160," So eh, what do you say? ",9,Seinfeld,25,6
31475,George,160," Ok, we got your...got your strawberries, your chocolate sauce,         your pastrami on rye with mustard, your honey... ",9,Seinfeld,121,17
31477,George,160," Oh yeah yeah, don't you know they used pastrami in that movie         9 weeks? Remember the pastrami scene? ",9,Seinfeld,109,18
31479,George,160," Well, maybe it was Ghostbusters? Where ever it was, it worked!       ",9,Seinfeld,70,11
31480,Jerry,160," Didn't go for it, huh? ",9,Seinfeld,24,5
31481,George,160, No. ,9,Seinfeld,5,1
31482,Jerry,160," So, she didn't appreciate the erotic qualities of the salted cured         meats? ",9,Seinfeld,83,12
31483,George,160," She tolerated the strawberries and the chocolate sauce, but eh,         it's not a meal, you know? Food and sex, those are my two passions. It's         only natural to combine them. ",9,Seinfeld,184,30
31484,Jerry,160," Natural? Sex is about love between a man and a woman, not a man         and a sandwich. ",9,Seinfeld,89,17
31485,George,160," Jerry, I'm not suggesting getting rid of the girl. She's integral.       ",9,Seinfeld,74,11
31486,Jerry,160," Maybe instead of trying to satisfy two of your needs, how about         satisfying one of somebody else's. ",9,Seinfeld,108,17
31487,George,160," Hey, speaking of which, I found a great way to separate the skin         from the top of the pudding without leaving any around the edges; Exacto         knife. ",9,Seinfeld,162,27
31488,Jerry,160," I told you George, no more pudding. I'm starting a purification         program. Keep all that kind of food away from me. ",9,Seinfeld,123,21
31489,George,160," Well, I guess these would be out of the question.  ",9,Seinfeld,52,10
31490,Jerry,160, What the hell is that? ,9,Seinfeld,24,5
31491,George,160, Pudding skin singles. ,9,Seinfeld,23,3
31492,Kramer,160," Hey buddy, I'm borrowing all your Tupperware. ",9,Seinfeld,47,7
31493,Jerry,160," Oh, why? ",9,Seinfeld,10,2
31494,Kramer,160, I closed down my account at the blood bank. ,9,Seinfeld,45,9
31495,Jerry,160," What, it...it's here in the building? ",9,Seinfeld,39,6
31496,Kramer,160," Right across the hall. What, you wanna go see? ",9,Seinfeld,48,9
31497,Jerry,160," No I don't! In fact, if even one corpuscles of that blood should         find it's way across that hall I will freak out on you Kramer! Freak out.       ",9,Seinfeld,154,28
31498,Kramer,160," You know, for a fat guy you're not very jolly. ",9,Seinfeld,48,10
31499,Elaine,160," Hey, working out? ",9,Seinfeld,19,3
31500,Jerry,160, You know it and I ditched all my junk food. ,9,Seinfeld,45,10
31501,Kramer,160, What the heck is going on here? ,9,Seinfeld,33,7
31502,Jerry,160," Sorry buddy, clean house. It's all health food. ",9,Seinfeld,49,8
31503,Kramer,160," Well, I may have to take it, but I don't have to like it. ",9,Seinfeld,59,14
31504,Elaine,160, Vivian left me a message. I guess a certain someone changed her         mind about whether someone was responsible enough to watch certain other         someone. ,9,Seinfeld,163,24
31505,Jerry,160, Is this about me? ,9,Seinfeld,19,4
31506,Elaine,160, No. ,9,Seinfeld,5,1
31507,Jerry,160," Oh, then I lost interest. ",9,Seinfeld,27,5
31508,Elaine,160," Vivian, hi it's Elaine. Yeah, I'm over at Jerry's, I got your         message...What? Yeah, he's right here, hold on...       ",9,Seinfeld,127,19
31509,Kramer,160," For me? Go...Yeah, what tonight? Yeah, I'll be there...Yeah later.          Well, somebody's baby-sitting. ",9,Seinfeld,108,13
31510,Elaine,160, You? I'm more responsible than you are! ,9,Seinfeld,41,7
31511,Kramer,160," Don't be ridiculous. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go to         fill my freezer with my own blood. ",9,Seinfeld,107,20
31512,George,160," Oh, Tara! ",9,Seinfeld,11,2
31513,Kramer,160," Hello, Vivian! Oh, this is a nice screen. ",9,Seinfeld,43,8
31514,Elaine,160, Kramer... ,9,Seinfeld,11,1
31515,Kramer,160, Don't take my money! ,9,Seinfeld,22,4
31516,Elaine,160," It is me, you idiot. Hi, all right you've got to get out of here,         I'm gonna baby-sit the hell out of that kid. ",9,Seinfeld,120,24
31517,Kramer,160," No, I'm the baby-sitter. ",9,Seinfeld,26,4
31518,Elaine,160," No no no, you're out, I'm in. Now, hit the road. ",9,Seinfeld,50,11
31520,Elaine,160," Kramer is actually sleeping one off, so I thought that I'd help         out... what's that, some raccoon or something... ",9,Seinfeld,122,19
31522,Elaine,160, Hi Jimmy.  Ouch!  ,9,Seinfeld,19,3
31523,Jerry,160," Hey, what are you doing here? I thought you were baby-sitting         at Vivian's. ",9,Seinfeld,84,13
31524,Kramer,160, There was an incident. ,9,Seinfeld,24,4
31525,Jerry,160," Oh no, where's the blood?  It's in here isn't         it? ",9,Seinfeld,59,10
31526,Kramer,160, Would you stop it. ,9,Seinfeld,20,4
31527,Jerry,160, What is this? ,9,Seinfeld,15,3
31528,Kramer,160, It's Jell-O. ,9,Seinfeld,14,2
31529,Jerry,160, What about this? This is blood isn't it?! ,9,Seinfeld,43,8
31530,Kramer,160," This is tomato juice, look... ",9,Seinfeld,31,5
31531,Jerry,160," Ooh, you're sick! You're sick!! ",9,Seinfeld,33,5
31532,Kramer,160, Will you calm down. I took all my blood down to Newman's. He         let me put it in his meat freezer. ,9,Seinfeld,105,21
31533,Jerry,160," Hey, what's going on? Who made pudding? ",9,Seinfeld,41,7
31534,Kramer,160," Oh yeah yeah, George he came by and made more of those pudding         skin singles. They're delicious. ",9,Seinfeld,105,17
31535,Jerry,160," Damn that George, I told him I don't want this stuff around here         anymore... ",9,Seinfeld,85,14
31536,Kramer,160, Heads up! ,9,Seinfeld,11,2
31537,Jerry,160, Aaah... ,9,Seinfeld,9,1
31539,Elaine,160, I wish I was dead. ,9,Seinfeld,20,5
31541,Elaine,160, As long as you don't put... ,9,Seinfeld,29,6
31542,Elaine,160, Thanks for the re-fill. ,9,Seinfeld,25,4
31544,Elaine,160," Oh, he's...he's a joy... ",9,Seinfeld,26,4
31546,Elaine,160," Oh, handful of sunshine. I wish I could do this every day. ",9,Seinfeld,60,12
31548,Elaine,160," It's not serious, is it? ",9,Seinfeld,26,5
31550,Elaine,160," Oh yeah, that eh...that is nice to know.  ",9,Seinfeld,43,8
31551,Jerry,160, Aah! ,9,Seinfeld,6,1
31552,Kramer,160," It's ok, Jerry. I'm right here. ",9,Seinfeld,33,6
31553,Jerry,160, I can see that! What happened? ,9,Seinfeld,32,6
31554,Kramer,160," That knife, it nicked your jugular. You know Jerry, when somebody         yells 'heads up', you're not supposed to actually look up. ",9,Seinfeld,134,21
31555,Jerry,160, I'll remember that. ,9,Seinfeld,21,3
31556,Kramer,160," Anyway, you were lucky that I was there. You lost a lot of blood.       ",9,Seinfeld,73,14
31557,Jerry,160, What? ,9,Seinfeld,7,1
31558,Kramer,160," Oh yeah, you've got three pints of Kramer in you, buddy. ",9,Seinfeld,58,11
31559,George,160, Three pints of Kramer's blood? ,9,Seinfeld,32,5
31560,Jerry,160, I can feel his blood inside of me. Borrowing things from my blood.       ,9,Seinfeld,74,13
31561,George,160," Well, so much for purification week. ",9,Seinfeld,38,6
31562,Jerry,160," So, how's the fornicating gourmet? ",9,Seinfeld,36,5
31563,George,160," Doing quite well, thank you. Yesterday I had a soft boiled egg         and a quickie. You know what? If I could add TV to the equation, that         would really be the ultimate. ",9,Seinfeld,180,32
31564,Jerry,160," George, we're trying to have a civilization here. ",9,Seinfeld,51,8
31565,Elaine,160, Hey. ,9,Seinfeld,6,1
31566,Jerry,160," Hey, how was baby-sitting? ",9,Seinfeld,28,4
31567,Elaine,160," Oh, just great. I found out that Vivian has some kind of medical         problem and if the worst happens she wants me to take care of Jimmy. ",9,Seinfeld,143,27
31568,Jerry,160," Oh, I'm sure it won't be the worst. ",9,Seinfeld,37,8
31569,Elaine,160," It doesn't matter. If anything happens to her, I'm on deck! Scissors         mishap, air show disaster, chinese organ thieves...it's a dangerous world.       ",9,Seinfeld,159,22
31570,George,160," She's right, I heard Kramer got mugged out on the suburbs on         a baby-sitting gig. ",9,Seinfeld,90,15
31571,Jerry,160, Really? ,9,Seinfeld,9,1
31572,Kramer,160," Look at this, look at the hair on the back of my neck. It's all         bramble, see it's like thicket back there. Look, I need somebody to shave         it for me, huh? ",9,Seinfeld,171,32
31573,Jerry,160, I'm not touching that thing. ,9,Seinfeld,30,5
31574,Kramer,160," Well, I have to say I'm very surprised and disappointed - blood         brother. ",9,Seinfeld,82,13
31575,Jerry,160," Oh, no... ",9,Seinfeld,11,2
31576,Kramer,160," What? Jerry, I gave you my blood. Listen to your pulse,  hey buddy-hey buddy-hey buddy... ",9,Seinfeld,91,15
31577,Jerry,160," Kramer, I'm not shaving your neck. ",9,Seinfeld,36,6
31578,Kramer,160," So, my blood is not enough. Would you like a kidney too, because         I'll give it to you? I'll rip it out right here and stack it on the table!       ",9,Seinfeld,155,30
31579,Jerry,160," All right, all right I'll do it, sit down. ",9,Seinfeld,44,9
31580,Kramer,160," No no no, I don't have time right now. I'll catch you tonight,         we'll do sort of an all over kind of thing, all right? ",9,Seinfeld,127,25
31581,Jerry,160, Hello? ,9,Seinfeld,8,1
31583,Jerry,160, Kramer called you? ,9,Seinfeld,20,3
31585,Jerry,160," Yes, I'm fine. ",9,Seinfeld,16,3
31589,Jerry,160," I don't need a personal trainer.  all right I've         got to go, we'll talk about this later. ",9,Seinfeld,98,17
31591,Jerry,160, Why are you calling my parents? ,9,Seinfeld,33,6
31592,Kramer,160," Well, maybe if you called more often, I wouldn't have to. Listen,         is it all right if I watch a tape in here? ",9,Seinfeld,118,23
31593,Jerry,160, Why here? ,9,Seinfeld,11,2
31594,Kramer,160," Well, I'm taping Canadian Parliament, you know on C-Span. ",9,Seinfeld,59,9
31595,Jerry,160, Ok... ,9,Seinfeld,7,1
31596,Kramer,160," Is it all right if I watch it in your bedroom, cause your bed         is really nice? ",9,Seinfeld,87,17
31597,Jerry,160, Fine... ,9,Seinfeld,9,1
31598,Kramer,160, Ok! ,9,Seinfeld,5,1
31599,Jerry,160, No no no no no no no no no no! I do not want that in here! ,9,Seinfeld,60,17
31600,Kramer,160, Blood! ,9,Seinfeld,8,1
31601,Jerry,160, All right. ,9,Seinfeld,12,2
31603,Jerry,160, Mr. Mandelbaum? You're the personal trainer? ,9,Seinfeld,46,6
31606,Elaine,160," Oh, hi, oh God. I didn't here you come in. ",9,Seinfeld,44,10
31608,Elaine,160," I don't know, I don't know...we had HoHos for dinner and then         eh...and then he put this plastic bag over his head and started running         around until he got tired and then he laid down somewhere I...I tell you         I'm no good watching that kid. ",9,Seinfeld,263,45
31610,Elaine,160, No! I'm a scatter brain. That's why I probably can't hold a job         or keep a man! ,9,Seinfeld,88,17
31612,Elaine,160," All right, but I'm running out of purses here.  ",9,Seinfeld,49,9
31613,Jerry,160," Ok Mr. Mandelbaum, what you want me to do? ",9,Seinfeld,44,9
31615,Jerry,160," Is this a gym, or some kind of fitness museum? ",9,Seinfeld,48,10
31617,Jerry,160, For what? ,9,Seinfeld,11,2
31619,Jerry,160, How many session did my parents paid for? ,9,Seinfeld,43,8
31621,George,160," Oohoho...spicy mustard...woohoho, you're hot tonight! ",9,Seinfeld,55,5
31623,George,160, And now for the trifecta.  ,9,Seinfeld,28,5
31625,George,160, Pleasuring you? ,9,Seinfeld,17,2
31627,Jerry,160, What is this? ,9,Seinfeld,15,3
31628,Kramer,160, We're making sausages. ,9,Seinfeld,24,3
31629,Jerry,160, I thought you were gonna watch a video. ,9,Seinfeld,41,8
31630,Kramer,160," Yeah, an instructional video about how to make your own sausages.       ",9,Seinfeld,73,11
31631,Jerry,160," Kramer, I'm not in a mood for this. ",9,Seinfeld,37,8
31632,Kramer,160," All right, all right. Newman, let's go grab some mail sacks and         haul these beauties out of here. ",9,Seinfeld,106,18
31633,Jerry,160," Blood over there, sausages over here. I'm living in a slaughter         house. ",9,Seinfeld,80,12
31635,Jerry,160, No they're not mine Mr. Mandelbaum... ,9,Seinfeld,39,6
31637,Jerry,160," So, the free love buffet is over? ",9,Seinfeld,35,7
31638,George,160, I got greedy. Flew too close to the sun on wings of pastrami.       ,9,Seinfeld,69,13
31639,Jerry,160," Yeah, that's what you did...I can't believe I got another session         with Izzy Mandelbaum, he's probably makes me box a kangaroo. ",9,Seinfeld,136,21
31640,Jerry,160, What's going on? ,9,Seinfeld,18,3
31641,George,160, I don't know. This sandwich is making me flush. ,9,Seinfeld,49,9
31642,Jerry,160," Oh no, I'll tell you what you did Caligula; you combined food         and sex in to one disgusting uncontrollable urge. ",9,Seinfeld,121,20
31643,George,160, I think you're right. You gonna eat that? ,9,Seinfeld,43,8
31644,Jerry,160," No, but please tell me that's all you're gonna do with it. ",9,Seinfeld,60,12
31645,Elaine,160," Jerry, I tell you; if this woman dies, it is going to be a major         inconvenience. ",9,Seinfeld,89,16
31646,George,160, These fries are really really good... ,9,Seinfeld,39,6
31647,Jerry,160," All right, that's enough of that.  ",9,Seinfeld,36,6
31648,Elaine,160," I mean I can't shake this woman. You know, now I have to go to         Jimmy's birthday party. ",9,Seinfeld,96,18
31649,George,160," Uuh, sleepy. ",9,Seinfeld,14,2
31650,Elaine,160," No matter what I do, I cannot weasel out of raising this kid.       ",9,Seinfeld,69,13
31651,Jerry,160," Well, sleepy here is quite a weasel, maybe he can bat for you.       ",9,Seinfeld,70,13
31652,Elaine,160," Yeah, that's what I need; a pinch weasel. ",9,Seinfeld,43,8
31653,Kramer,160, Why did you get rid of that sausage? ,9,Seinfeld,38,8
31654,Jerry,160," It wasn't me, it was Mr. Mandelbaum. ",9,Seinfeld,38,7
31655,Kramer,160," Yeah well, Newman's not happy, he booted me out of his freezer.         Look, I've got to take my blood back to the bank, can I borrow your car?       ",9,Seinfeld,152,28
31656,Jerry,160, What's wrong with yours? ,9,Seinfeld,26,4
31657,Kramer,160, I got no A/C and I gotta keep the blood cold or it'll go bad.       ,9,Seinfeld,69,15
31658,Jerry,160," All right, but this is it, this is the last favor, we're even!       ",9,Seinfeld,70,13
31659,Kramer,160," All right, Even Steven. Oh, by the way, when you get back to         your apartment try to keep it down because Newman is taking a nap in your         bed. ",9,Seinfeld,157,29
31660,Kramer,160," Oh, man... ""If         the engine begins to overheat, turn off air conditioner"". Never,         I can't do that. ",9,Seinfeld,114,17
31661,Kramer,160," Oh, mama... ",9,Seinfeld,13,2
31662,Kramer,160," Shees, come on.....this thing is bone dry.          ",9,Seinfeld,53,7
31663,Elaine,160, Vivian... ,9,Seinfeld,11,1
31665,Elaine,160, Hi! This is my friend George. ,9,Seinfeld,31,6
31667,Elaine,160, I'm gonna go say hi to Jimmy. ,9,Seinfeld,31,7
31671,George,160, Yes she is. It's a pity we won't be seeing much more of her.       ,9,Seinfeld,68,14
31673,George,160," Oh, you haven't heard, she's going to live with her grandparents         in Redding Pennsylvania. ",9,Seinfeld,99,14
31675,George,160, Yes they did. I was covering. Elaine has been deported back to         Scotland. ,9,Seinfeld,82,13
31677,George,160," All right, no more lies. Elaine is been chosen to represent the         Upper West Side in the next Biosphere project. ",9,Seinfeld,120,20
31679,George,160, That's because it's underwater. ,9,Seinfeld,33,4
31681,George,160, Is it? ,9,Seinfeld,8,2
31683,George,160," Well, it's all for charity, so what's the difference. ",9,Seinfeld,55,9
31685,George,160," Well, I'm also an architect. Is that pastrami? ",9,Seinfeld,48,8
31687,George,160, Very. ,9,Seinfeld,7,1

31960,Kramer,162," Well, Jerry, we have a little surprise for you! Come on               out, Celia!",9,Seinfeld,82,13
31963,Jerry,162, What is this? What is she doing here?,9,Seinfeld,38,8
31964,Kramer,162, It's the new format. Scandals and Animals. Go with it.,9,Seinfeld,55,10
31967,Jerry,162," Well, what kind of woman drinks a whole box of wine?",9,Seinfeld,53,11
31969,George,162," Mister Fowler, I have a squirrel here that is a miracle               of modern science!",9,Seinfeld,89,14
31970,Kramer,162, George I told you we're booked!,9,Seinfeld,32,6
31972,Kramer,162," Ohhh. another interesting confrontation. This could be               spicy. Yeah, George bring him over.",9,Seinfeld,105,13
31974,Kramer,162, Are we getting this?,9,Seinfeld,21,4
31975,Jerry,162, So the whole set was destroyed?,9,Seinfeld,32,6
31976,Kramer,162," Well, the squirrel kept scurrying and the hawk kept clawing.",9,Seinfeld,61,10
31977,George,162," Well, at least we know the prosthetic squirrel hips work               ... sorry about the set.",9,Seinfeld,96,15
31978,Kramer,162, I tell y'a it was a grind trying to fill 10 hours a week.               I'm not sure I was ready to have my own ,9,Seinfeld,113,24
31980,Jerry,162, So the squirrel's gonna make it?,9,Seinfeld,33,6
31981,George,162," Yeah, he's in my bed. I'm sleeping on the couch.",9,Seinfeld,49,10
31982,Jerry,162, Sleeping on the couch? So you're...,9,Seinfeld,36,6
31983,George,162, Still getting nothing! So go ahead pigeons. Laugh it up.               I'm getting in my car now and the last ,9,Seinfeld,111,19
31985,Elaine,162," Oh well, hey, I dated Jerry too. I know what a monster               he can be. More wine and turkey?",9,Seinfeld,102,19
31987,Elaine,162," Oh, he's nobody. Hey, listen, ... let me top that off for               y'a.",9,Seinfeld,77,13
31992,Elaine,163, Hey. ,9,Seinfeld,6,1
31993,Jerry,163, Morning. ,9,Seinfeld,10,1
31994,Elaine,163," Look, this is crazy, I can't go on like this. ",9,Seinfeld,47,10
31995,Jerry,163, But why? ,9,Seinfeld,10,2
31996,Elaine,163, I need some space. ,9,Seinfeld,20,4
31997,George,163, Does that mean I have to go too? ,9,Seinfeld,34,8
31998,Jerry,163, You don't think she's just talking to me? ,9,Seinfeld,43,8
31999,George,163," Hey, shut up. ",9,Seinfeld,15,3
32000,Jerry,163, You shut up. ,9,Seinfeld,14,3
32001,Elaine,163, I hate this. ,9,Seinfeld,14,3
32002,Kramer,163, You'll get used to it. It's like a grubby scrub. ,9,Seinfeld,50,10
32003,Elaine,163," No, I don't want this anymore. ",9,Seinfeld,32,6
32004,Jerry,163, We'll come to work with you. ,9,Seinfeld,30,6
32005,George,163, And on your dates. ,9,Seinfeld,20,4
32006,Jerry,163, And shopping. ,9,Seinfeld,15,2
32007,Kramer,163, And to the bathroom. ,9,Seinfeld,22,4
32009,Elaine,163, I can't breath...I'm sorry... You're killing         me! ,9,Seinfeld,58,7
32011,Elaine,163,  Turn your alarm off!!  ,9,Seinfeld,25,4
32013,George,163," Well, at the Yankees it was all about smoothing things over,         you know, chiseling away, grinding down. In fact we used to call it 'the         grind'. ",9,Seinfeld,159,26
32015,George,163," That should be 14, let me just... ",9,Seinfeld,35,7
32017,George,163," You won't regret this, sir. ",9,Seinfeld,29,5
32020,George,163,...and then when I saw the photo I remembered where I'd seen him;         the boom box incident. ,9,Seinfeld,97,17
32021,Jerry,163, The boom box incident? ,9,Seinfeld,24,4
32022,George,163," Summer of '89 I'm at the beach. This family sits up next to me.         I go in to the surfs and when I come from out, my clothes, my towel, my         umbrella, they're all gone. I am furious, I start screaming to these kids         demanding my stuff back and finally I lose it; I grab their boom box and         I chuck it in to the ocean. ",9,Seinfeld,344,66
32023,Jerry,163, Seems reasonable. ,9,Seinfeld,19,2
32024,George,163," Then I see my clothes floating out there. The tied took them         out, not the kids. ",9,Seinfeld,89,16
32025,Jerry,163, Even more reasonable. ,9,Seinfeld,23,3
32026,George,163," So now, the father is screaming at me, he's demanding that I         pay for the boom box. Finally, I gave them a fake address and got the         hell out of there. ",9,Seinfeld,167,31
32027,Jerry,163, And that guy is your new boss? ,9,Seinfeld,32,7
32028,George,163, Until that stupid photo jogs his memory. ,9,Seinfeld,42,7
32029,Kramer,163," Kruger? That's not Kruger Industrial Smoothing, is it? ",9,Seinfeld,56,8
32030,George,163, Yeah. ,9,Seinfeld,7,1
32031,Kramer,163," Grinders, sanders, wet stones. They are the ones who botched         the Statue of Liberty job. ",9,Seinfeld,97,15
32032,Jerry,163," Right, they couldn't get the green stuff off. ",9,Seinfeld,47,8
32033,George,163, It is a horrible company. There's no management what so ever.         I could go hog wild in there. ,9,Seinfeld,101,18
32034,Kramer,163, You now what you do? You sneak that photo out of there for couple         of days and get it air brushed. ,9,Seinfeld,107,21
32035,George,163, Like retouched. ,9,Seinfeld,17,2
32036,Kramer,163, You remember that photo of me and Gerald Ford and I took it in.         Got that Ford right out of there. ,9,Seinfeld,107,21
32037,George,163," Oh, this is good. This Kruger guy is clueless. I can't wait to         work for him. ",9,Seinfeld,86,16
32038,Kramer,163," Look at this. This sandwich is terrible. Everywhere you go, they         give you this misshaped shardy meat. Look at this... ",9,Seinfeld,127,20
32039,Kramer,163, I haven't had a decent sandwich in 13 years. ,9,Seinfeld,46,9
32040,Jerry,163, Neither have I. ,9,Seinfeld,17,3
32041,Kramer,163," Hey, our meat problems are solved. ",9,Seinfeld,36,6
32042,Jerry,163, Where did you get this thing? ,9,Seinfeld,31,6
32043,Kramer,163," I traded it to my sausage press. Look how thin that is, see that's         all surface area. The taste has nowhere to hide. ",9,Seinfeld,125,23
32044,Elaine,163, Hey. ,9,Seinfeld,6,1
32045,Kramer,163," Hey, spice.  Welcome to flavor         country. ",9,Seinfeld,49,6
32046,Elaine,163," Yeah, that's pretty good. ",9,Seinfeld,27,4
32047,Jerry,163," Hey, I got a date with that doctor you met. ",9,Seinfeld,45,10
32048,Elaine,163, Sara Sitarides? ,9,Seinfeld,17,2
32049,Jerry,163, Mmhu. ,9,Seinfeld,7,1
32050,Elaine,163, Oh... ,9,Seinfeld,7,1
32051,Jerry,163, What's with you? ,9,Seinfeld,18,3
32052,Elaine,163," You remember that next door neighbor of mine, the apartment that         always smells like potatoes? ",9,Seinfeld,103,15
32053,Jerry,163, Your whole building smells like potatoes. ,9,Seinfeld,43,6
32054,Kramer,163," You know, that happened to Lomez, so he blew his neighbor's circuit.       ",9,Seinfeld,76,12
32055,Elaine,163, How do you do that? ,9,Seinfeld,21,5
32056,Kramer,163," Yeah well, that's easy. Just let me finish this mile high and         I'll be right with you. Oh, and Jerry, we are gonna need a case of Kaiser         rolls. ",9,Seinfeld,160,29
32057,Jerry,163, I think we might have one left in the stock room. ,9,Seinfeld,51,11
32058,Kramer,163, This hallway smells like potatoes. ,9,Seinfeld,36,5
32059,Elaine,163," I know, I know, this is it.  ",9,Seinfeld,30,7
32060,Kramer,163," Ok, oh, you see this socket it's probably connected to her apartment.         So what we'll do, we'll take this paper clip and bend it so it'll short         out the entire circuit. Here you go... ",9,Seinfeld,198,34
32061,Elaine,163, I think I'll let you do it. ,9,Seinfeld,29,7
32062,Kramer,163," No no no. It's easy, you just...do it quickly. ",9,Seinfeld,48,9
32063,Elaine,163," No, I really don't want to. ",9,Seinfeld,29,6
32064,Kramer,163," Well, I don't want to either. ",9,Seinfeld,31,6
32065,Elaine,163, I thought you had done this before. ,9,Seinfeld,37,7
32066,Kramer,163, It's just...it's no picnic. ,9,Seinfeld,29,4
32067,Elaine,163," Well, how are we gonna do it? ",9,Seinfeld,31,7
32068,Kramer,163," Alright, fine fine, I'll do it. ",9,Seinfeld,33,6
32069,Kramer,163, Oh mama. ,9,Seinfeld,10,2
32070,Elaine,163, Are you okay? ,9,Seinfeld,15,3
32071,Kramer,163, I will lose that nail. ,9,Seinfeld,24,5
32073,Jerry,163," Well, I have this neighbor... ",9,Seinfeld,31,5
32075,Jerry,163, Is it anything like hitting a home run in softball? ,9,Seinfeld,53,10
32077,Jerry,163, Cause I hit a whopper last week! ,9,Seinfeld,34,7
32079,George,163, What did you do here? You took out the wrong guy. ,9,Seinfeld,51,11
32081,George,163," Well, I'm still here. You took out the other guy! ",9,Seinfeld,51,10
32083,George,163, I am aware! ,9,Seinfeld,13,3
32085,Elaine,163, The cat. ,9,Seinfeld,10,2
32086,Jerry,163, He took out Kruger? ,9,Seinfeld,21,4
32087,George,163, I just pray Kruger doesn't realize that it's gone until this         guy can fix it up. ,9,Seinfeld,89,16
32088,Kramer,163, This slicer is indomitable. ,9,Seinfeld,29,4
32089,Jerry,163, Where did you get that butcher's coat? ,9,Seinfeld,40,7
32090,Kramer,163," You buy enough meat, they'll give you anything. ",9,Seinfeld,49,8
32091,Elaine,163," Kramer, my neighbor has a cat. When you blew the power, we must've         shut off the automatic feeder. ",9,Seinfeld,107,18
32092,Kramer,163," See, that's the same thing that happened to Lomez. ",9,Seinfeld,52,9
32093,Elaine,163, What did he do about it? ,9,Seinfeld,26,6
32094,Kramer,163," Well, he moved to a hotel and the cat eventually died. ",9,Seinfeld,56,11
32095,Elaine,163," Well, this meowing is absolutely worst than the alarm. ",9,Seinfeld,56,9
32096,Kramer,163," Oh, that's a prickly one. ",9,Seinfeld,27,5
32097,Elaine,163," Yeah, how's the doctor date? ",9,Seinfeld,30,5
32098,Jerry,163," Eh, died on the table. Just spent hour and a half making me feel,         if I don't save lives, I'm worthless. ",9,Seinfeld,113,21
32099,Elaine,163," Well, she's very focused. Dermatology is her life. ",9,Seinfeld,52,8
32100,Jerry,163, Dermatology? ,9,Seinfeld,14,1
32101,Elaine,163," Yes, she's a dermatologist. ",9,Seinfeld,29,4
32102,Jerry,163," Saving lives? The whole profession is; eh, just put some aloe         on it. ",9,Seinfeld,78,13
32103,Kramer,163," The slicer! Elaine, let's go. ",9,Seinfeld,31,5
32104,Elaine,163, Where are we going? ,9,Seinfeld,21,4
32105,Kramer,163, The cat. Just grab that meat and let's ride. ,9,Seinfeld,46,9
32106,George,163, When are you going on your next date with her? ,9,Seinfeld,48,10
32107,Jerry,163," Oh, what's the point? ",9,Seinfeld,23,4
32108,George,163," What, you're gonna pass up a wonderful opportunity to put that         aloe pusher in her place? ",9,Seinfeld,98,16
32109,Jerry,163, Revenge date? That sound like you more than me. ,9,Seinfeld,49,9
32110,George,163," This good be so sweet, Jerry. Saving lives? She's one step away         working at the clinique counter! ",9,Seinfeld,106,17
32111,Jerry,163, Dermatologist? Skin doesn't need a doctor! ,9,Seinfeld,44,6
32112,George,163," Of course not! Wash it, dry it, move on! ",9,Seinfeld,42,9
32113,Jerry,163, You're right. I'm gonna call her right now and tell her off. ,9,Seinfeld,62,12
32114,George,163," No no no no no, this has to be carefully orchestrated. You go         to a fancy dinner, flowers... ",9,Seinfeld,101,18
32115,Jerry,163, Flowers? ,9,Seinfeld,10,1
32116,George,163," Yeah, you gotta do it classy        ",9,Seinfeld,37,6
32117,Jerry,163," So, you've done this? ",9,Seinfeld,23,4
32118,George,163, Almost. Couldn't get the girl go out with me the second time.       ,9,Seinfeld,69,12
32119,Kramer,163, I think we are looking half a millimeter. ,9,Seinfeld,43,8
32120,Elaine,163, Can it cut that thin? ,9,Seinfeld,23,5
32121,Kramer,163," Oh, I've cut slices so thin, I couldn't even see them. ",9,Seinfeld,56,11
32122,Elaine,163, How did you know you cut it? ,9,Seinfeld,30,7
32123,Kramer,163," Well, I guess I just assumed. ",9,Seinfeld,31,6
32124,Elaine,163," Hold on kitty, dinner's coming. ",9,Seinfeld,33,5
32125,Kramer,163," Yeah, that's a hall of famer. ",9,Seinfeld,31,6
32126,Elaine,163," Alright, let's do it. ",9,Seinfeld,23,4
32127,Kramer,163," Alright, here we go. Yeah, watch that baby slide... ",9,Seinfeld,53,9
32128,Elaine,163," Come on, come on kitty... ooh...how about that;         it worked! Wow, can I borrow that thing for a while? ",9,Seinfeld,110,19
32129,Kramer,163," Oh no, I don't think so. ",9,Seinfeld,26,6
32130,Elaine,163, Why not? ,9,Seinfeld,10,2
32131,Kramer,163," Well, you're not checked at on it. ",9,Seinfeld,36,7
32132,Elaine,163, What do I have to know? ,9,Seinfeld,25,6
32133,Kramer,163," Well, where the meat goes? ",9,Seinfeld,28,5
32134,Elaine,163, Right there. ,9,Seinfeld,14,2
32135,Kramer,163, Where do you turn it on? ,9,Seinfeld,26,6
32136,Elaine,163, Right there. ,9,Seinfeld,14,2
32137,Kramer,163, But where does the meat go?          ,9,Seinfeld,38,6
32139,Jerry,163," Well, I'm a classy guy. How's the life saving business? ",9,Seinfeld,57,10
32141,Jerry,163," It must take a really really big zit, to kill a man! ",9,Seinfeld,54,12
32143,Jerry,163, You call yourself a lifesaver. I call you pimple popper MD! ,9,Seinfeld,61,11
32147,Jerry,163, She saved your life? ,9,Seinfeld,22,4
32149,Jerry,163, Skin cancer! Damn. ,9,Seinfeld,20,3
32150,Elaine,163," You were right Kramer, this slicer is absolutely amazing...yeah,         yeah...no no no I'll bring it by tonight...ok bye.          ",9,Seinfeld,134,18
32151,Elaine,163, These heals are so uneven.  ,9,Seinfeld,29,5
32153,George,163, What is this? This is a drawing. ,9,Seinfeld,34,7
32155,George,163, This is a cartoon! ,9,Seinfeld,20,4
32157,George,163," But it's not a photograph, I need a photograph! ",9,Seinfeld,49,9
32159,Jerry,163, He looks like a Peanuts character. ,9,Seinfeld,36,6
32160,George,163," I know. The only way to fix it now, is to get a whole new photo         of Kruger. ",9,Seinfeld,84,18
32161,Jerry,163, You can do that. ,9,Seinfeld,18,4
32162,George,163, Without his shirt on. ,9,Seinfeld,23,4
32163,Jerry,163," You can't do that. Well, maybe Kruger wasn't the place for you.       ",9,Seinfeld,71,12
32164,George,163, It seemed so disorganized. ,9,Seinfeld,28,4
32165,Jerry,163, I understand. ,9,Seinfeld,15,2
32166,George,163," What about the Coast Guard? Seems like a lot of pride there,         a lot of tradition. ",9,Seinfeld,90,16
32167,Jerry,163," True. You mean, for you? ",9,Seinfeld,26,5
32168,George,163, I think. ,9,Seinfeld,10,2
32169,Jerry,163, What about your sea sickness? ,9,Seinfeld,31,5
32170,George,163, Maybe I could be a land guy. ,9,Seinfeld,30,7
32171,Jerry,163, I don't know if they have land guys. ,9,Seinfeld,38,8
32172,George,163, Someone's have to unhook the boat before it leaves...the place!       ,9,Seinfeld,71,10
32173,Elaine,163, Pliers? ,9,Seinfeld,9,1
32174,Jerry,163, Drawer. ,9,Seinfeld,9,1
32175,Elaine,163, Got it. ,9,Seinfeld,9,2
32176,Jerry,163, What are they for? ,9,Seinfeld,20,4
32177,Elaine,163, I...eh...I got a piece a my heal stuck in a slicer. ,9,Seinfeld,53,11
32178,Jerry,163, Come again? ,9,Seinfeld,13,2
32179,Elaine,163," Okay, I got a little slicer happy, but listen; don't tell Kramer,         okay? He has very strong feelings for it. ",9,Seinfeld,117,20
32180,George,163, I forgot to ask you; how did the revenge date go? ,9,Seinfeld,51,11
32181,Jerry,163," Eh, it went okay. ",9,Seinfeld,19,4
32182,George,163," Did you dressed nice, did you do it classy? ",9,Seinfeld,45,9
32183,Jerry,163," Yeah, I started out real classy... ",9,Seinfeld,36,6
32184,George,163," Yeah you did, you classed it up! ",9,Seinfeld,34,7
32185,Jerry,163, But then I found out about the skin cancer. ,9,Seinfeld,45,9
32186,George,163," Oh, so it backfired? ",9,Seinfeld,22,4
32187,Jerry,163, Yeah. ,9,Seinfeld,7,1
32188,George,163," So, I guess I was lucky that I never tried that myself. ",9,Seinfeld,57,12
32189,Elaine,163," Of course she treats skin cancer. That's how I met her, she was         doing a skin cancer screening at Peterman. That's what dermatologists         do. ",9,Seinfeld,155,24
32190,Jerry,163," Sadly, that knowledge could've help me. ",9,Seinfeld,41,6
32191,George,163," Wait a minute, she did a skin cancer screening at Peterman? ",9,Seinfeld,61,11
32192,Elaine,163, Aha. ,9,Seinfeld,6,1
32193,George,163, Could she do that at Kruger? ,9,Seinfeld,30,6
32194,Elaine,163," I don't know, I guess. ",9,Seinfeld,24,5
32195,George,163," So I set up a screening, everyone takes their shirt off and click,         I snap me a shot of a bear-chested Kruger. ",9,Seinfeld,119,22
32196,Elaine,163, You have a little thing for this fella'? ,9,Seinfeld,42,8
32197,George,163," Jerry, you gotta talk to Sitarides. ",9,Seinfeld,37,6
32198,Jerry,163, Yesterday you said I had to get my revenge on her! ,9,Seinfeld,52,11
32199,George,163," And that was wrong, Jerry! You simple must to apologize.. ",9,Seinfeld,59,10
32200,Jerry,163, Must I? ,9,Seinfeld,9,2

32274,Kramer,163," Well, he's got a mole on his shoulder. Very suspicious. ",9,Seinfeld,57,10
32275,George,163," So, tell him you're concerned about it and he should see someone         else. ",9,Seinfeld,80,13
32276,Kramer,163," George, why would I, a Juilliard trained dermatologist, send         him to another doctor? ",9,Seinfeld,93,13
32277,George,163," Because, you're not a dermatologist. ",9,Seinfeld,38,5
32278,Kramer,163, He thinks I am. I'm not gonna betray that trust. Here's what         I wanna do; I think I can get a section... ,9,Seinfeld,113,22
32279,George,163," Whoa, whoa, a section?! ",9,Seinfeld,25,4
32280,Kramer,163," Yeah, if I could crab my slicer and he'd hold still... ",9,Seinfeld,56,11

32294,Jerry,163," Well, that woman had it coming to her. Look at my neck, it looks         like I had a beard of bees! ",9,Seinfeld,102,21
32295,George,163, Why don't you see someone about it? ,9,Seinfeld,37,7
32296,Jerry,163, I've called everyone. You know how hard it is to get a dermatologist         in this town?  A real dermatologist. ,9,Seinfeld,115,19
32297,Kramer,163,  Squamous cell carcinoma. ,9,Seinfeld,27,3
32298,George,163, You're not a doctor. You shouldn't even have books like this.       ,9,Seinfeld,69,11

32300,George,163," You can't tell him the truth, you're gonna blow the whole thing.       ",9,Seinfeld,72,12
32301,Kramer,163, I don't want this on my conscience. ,9,Seinfeld,37,7
32302,George,163, I'll get him to see a real doctor. You just stay away from this.       ,9,Seinfeld,72,14
32303,Kramer,163," Yeah, alright... ",9,Seinfeld,18,2
32304,Jerry,163," Hey, I wonder if they have a picture of my rash in here. ",9,Seinfeld,58,13
32305,Kramer,163," They've got everything there, Jerry. I underlined the best parts.       ",9,Seinfeld,73,10
32306,Jerry,163," Hey, this looks like the thing I have. Caused by exposure to benzene,         a common ingredient in metal cleaners. ",9,Seinfeld,118,19
32307,Kramer,163," Well, that's weird. ",9,Seinfeld,21,3
32308,Jerry,163, What are you doing? ,9,Seinfeld,21,4
32309,Kramer,163," Well, I'm cleaning my slicer. ",9,Seinfeld,31,5
32310,Jerry,163," That's my hand towel! I use that on my face, hands and chest!         That's where the hives are coming from! It's not from Dr. Sitarides, it's         from Dr. Van Nostrand! ",9,Seinfeld,176,30
32311,Kramer,163," So, somehow the Bronzo  is reacting to the poison she's giving         you. ",9,Seinfeld,77,12
32312,Jerry,163," Alright, get out. And take your Bronzo with you  ",9,Seinfeld,50,9
32313,Kramer,163," Ohh, that's toxic.          Ououou.... ",9,Seinfeld,40,4
32315,George,163," Eh, listen Mr. Kruger, I got a message from Dr. Van Nostrand         and he says it might be wise to you to see another doctor about that mole.       ",9,Seinfeld,151,28
32317,George,163," Well, he said it could be cancer, maybe you should get it checked         out. ",9,Seinfeld,80,14
32319,George,163, Whatever. ,9,Seinfeld,11,1
32321,George,163," Well, that pear shaped loser was me! And I was in that photo,         until I broke in here, stole the photograph and airbrushed myself out         of there! ",9,Seinfeld,159,27
32323,George,163, That's what they tell me! ,9,Seinfeld,27,5
32324,Kramer,163, Do you want more pastrami? ,9,Seinfeld,28,5
32325,Elaine,163," Um, what was that last thing you gave me? That was pretty good.       ",9,Seinfeld,71,13
32326,Kramer,163," Yeah, it was olive loaf. You want that? ",9,Seinfeld,41,8
32327,Jerry,163, I can't believe Kruger didn't fire you after all you did. ,9,Seinfeld,59,11
32328,George,163," He said he didn't care. Oh, God I love that place. Hey, have         you seen other dermatologist? ",9,Seinfeld,100,17
32329,Jerry,163," Yeah, I finally got to see Dr. Kazarian. He said it was really         bad. ",9,Seinfeld,77,14
32330,George,163, What did he give you for it. ,9,Seinfeld,30,7

34961,Jerry,175," Well, what street are you on?",9,Seinfeld,30,6
34962,Kramer,175," Hey, I'm on first and first. How can the same street intersect               with itself? I must be at the nexus of the universe.",9,Seinfeld,130,23
34963,Jerry,175," Just wait there. I'll pick you up, and, Kramer, stay alive               no matter what occurs, I will find you!",9,Seinfeld,113,19

34978,Elaine,175," Bobby, you gotta stop calling your Gammy. Why? Because               sometimes you call very early in the morning when Gammy has been               out late the night before and sometimes when Gammy's not alone.               Your parents still haven't said anything to you about your Gammy?                All right, here we go.  Gammy doesn't feel so               good. I think",9,Seinfeld,381,55

35024,Elaine,176, How can you be hungry after what you ate at that Mets game?,9,Seinfeld,60,13
35025,George,176, Because ballpark food doesn't count as real food.,9,Seinfeld,50,8
35026,Jerry,176, Right. It's just an activity. It's like that paddle with               the ball and the rubber band.,9,Seinfeld,101,16
35027,Kramer,176," You know, my friend Bob Saccamano made a fortune off of               those. See he came up with the idea for the rubber band. Before               that, people would just hit the ball, and it would fly away. ",9,Seinfeld,210,36
35028,Jerry,176, I can't believe you all made me leave before the end of               the game.,9,Seinfeld,80,14

35033,Kramer,176," Come on, Jerry, you're going to miss the exit.",9,Seinfeld,47,9
35034,Jerry,176, Keep your shirt on. I got it.,9,Seinfeld,30,7
35035,Elaine,176, Watch out for that maroon Golf.,9,Seinfeld,32,6
35036,Kramer,176," Oh, boy.",9,Seinfeld,9,2
35037,Jerry,176, Look at this guy. He's trying to box me out.,9,Seinfeld,45,10

35041,Elaine,176," Oh, no, I couldn't do that.",9,Seinfeld,28,6
35042,Kramer,176," Look at this, look at this. He's giving us the finger.",9,Seinfeld,55,11
35043,Elaine,176," Oh, all right.",9,Seinfeld,15,3
35044,Kramer,176, Yeah.,9,Seinfeld,6,1
35045,George,176, So I saw that new movie about the Hindenburg.,9,Seinfeld,46,9
35046,Elaine,176," Oh, yeah. What's that called?",9,Seinfeld,30,5
35047,Jerry,176, How was it?,9,Seinfeld,12,3
35048,George,176, I found it morose. Why dwell on these negative themes?,9,Seinfeld,55,10
35049,Jerry,176, Yeah. They should make a movie about all the Hindenburg               flights that made it.,9,Seinfeld,92,14
35050,George,176," Anyway, right in the middle, the ship blows up-- burning               debris, bodies falling-- and then just as this eerie silence settles               over the airfield, I yelled out, ""That's gotta hurt!""",9,Seinfeld,208,30
35051,Jerry,176, Heh.,9,Seinfeld,5,1
35052,George,176, The place went nuts.,9,Seinfeld,21,4
35053,Jerry,176, Imagine the laugh you could have gotten if you'd yelled               that out at the actual disaster.,9,Seinfeld,103,16
35054,George,176, Yeah.,9,Seinfeld,6,1
35055,Kramer,176, Why are we slowing down?,9,Seinfeld,25,5
35056,Jerry,176, What is that music?,9,Seinfeld,20,4
35057,George,176, What's with all these flags?,9,Seinfeld,29,5
35058,Jerry,176," Oh, no.",9,Seinfeld,8,2
35060,Elaine,176," Ohh! Oh, the city shuts down Fifth avenue. They never let               anyone through.",9,Seinfeld,88,13
35061,Kramer,176, All right. I'm gonna check it out. Aiee. mucho trafico.,9,Seinfeld,56,10
35063,Kramer,176," Yeah...uhh...well, the streets are all blocked. I think               every Puerto Rican in the world is out here.",9,Seinfeld,115,17
35065,Kramer,176, Whoo. Wrong car. Sorry.,9,Seinfeld,24,4
35067,Jerry,176," See? If we had stayed, we could have seen those runs. ",9,Seinfeld,55,11
35068,George,176, I could have had some ice cream. I think that might have               calmed down the nachos.,9,Seinfeld,95,16
35069,Elaine,176," I'm going to miss 60 Minutes. You know, I hate to miss               60 Minutes. It's part of my Sunday weekend wind-down.",9,Seinfeld,123,21
35070,Jerry,176, I don't know how you can unwind with that clock ticking.               It makes me anxious.,9,Seinfeld,92,15
35071,Kramer,176," All right, gentlemen, I scouted it out. I think we can               get out over there.",9,Seinfeld,89,15
35072,Jerry,176," But that's a one-way street coming this way. Besides, how               am I gonna get all the way over there?",9,Seinfeld,111,19
35073,George,176, Just inch over. You worm your way.,9,Seinfeld,35,7
35074,Elaine,176," Just do it, Jerry. Uhh. This exhaust. I'm gonna throw up.",9,Seinfeld,58,11
35075,Kramer,176," You know, you should make yourself throw up.",9,Seinfeld,45,8

35081,George,176, My hand is out.,9,Seinfeld,16,4

35083,Elaine,176, You sure you want his face?,9,Seinfeld,28,6
35084,Kramer,176," No, no, no. It was Mara Conchita Alonso.",9,Seinfeld,41,8
35085,George,176, This guy's giving me the stare-ahead.,9,Seinfeld,38,6
35086,Jerry,176, The stare-ahead. I hate that. I use it all the time.,9,Seinfeld,53,11

35097,Elaine,176," All right, I think I know where this is going, and I am               going somewhere else.",9,Seinfeld,92,16
35098,Jerry,176, You can't do that. You can't just leave the group.,9,Seinfeld,51,10
35099,Elaine,176, I've been trying to leave this group for 10 years. Vaya               con dios.,9,Seinfeld,80,13
35100,Kramer,176," Con dios? Well, that's rude.",9,Seinfeld,29,5

35104,George,176, The movies. Blimp is playing right there.,9,Seinfeld,42,7
35105,Jerry,176, You're going to that again? Why? Just to do that stupid               line?,9,Seinfeld,76,12
35106,George,176," It's a performance, Jerry. Like what you do.",9,Seinfeld,45,8
35107,Jerry,176, That's not what I do.,9,Seinfeld,22,5

35112,Elaine,176, Look at that guy's dog. I hate it when their ears get flipped               inside out like that. Why doesn't he fix it? ,9,Seinfeld,122,22
35114,Elaine,176, Ooh! This isn't moving! I could walk faster than this.,9,Seinfeld,55,10

35132,Kramer,176," You want to get outta here? Here's what we do. We leave               the car here, we take the plates off, we scratch the serial number               off the engine block, and we walk away.",9,Seinfeld,191,33
35133,Jerry,176, Walk away?,9,Seinfeld,11,2

35139,Jerry,176, From what?,9,Seinfeld,11,2
35140,Kramer,176," The car, which we're leaving. So the net is zero. See you               pocket the money, if there is any, and you get a new car.",9,Seinfeld,130,25
35141,Jerry,176, We're not leaving the car!,9,Seinfeld,27,5
35142,Kramer,176," All right. If you refuse to grow up and scam your insurance               company, you'll have to work this out with maroon Golf.",9,Seinfeld,130,22
35143,Jerry,176, Absolutely not. He sped up.,9,Seinfeld,28,5
35145,Jerry,176, I'm ready to talk.,9,Seinfeld,19,4

35503,Jerry,179, So now she's lost a phone face-off? That's even worse than your cell phone        walk-and-talk.,9,Seinfeld,97,15
35508,Jerry,179," Yeah, it's pretty good.",9,Seinfeld,24,4
35510,George,179, I'm moving to California.,9,Seinfeld,26,4
35513,George,179, Of course he liked it.,9,Seinfeld,23,5
35515,George,179, He wouldn't put it on if he didn't like it.,9,Seinfeld,44,10
35517,George,179, I'm writing.,9,Seinfeld,13,2
35521,George,179, Ma?!,9,Seinfeld,5,1
35524,George,179, I don't need any ideas. It's a show about nothing.,9,Seinfeld,51,10
35526,Jerry,179, NBC is letting me use their private jet? And I can go anywhere I want? That's        fantastic! Thanks. Great. ,9,Seinfeld,112,19
35527,Kramer,179, Oh hey!,9,Seinfeld,8,2
35528,Jerry,179, Hey - how was the beach?,9,Seinfeld,25,6
35529,Kramer,179," Oh, you missed it, buddy - lot of femininas - some major femininas",9,Seinfeld,67,13
35530,Jerry,179, I had a little meeting today at NBC. What are you doing?,9,Seinfeld,57,12
35531,Kramer,179," You know, I went swimming and I can't get this water out of my ear.",9,Seinfeld,68,15
35532,Jerry,179," So do you remember five years ago, we did that pilot, ""Jerry""? Well,        the new guy at NBC wants to do it. ",9,Seinfeld,112,22
35533,Kramer,179, You're moving to California?,9,Seinfeld,29,4
35534,Jerry,179," Yeah, only for a while.",9,Seinfeld,24,5
35535,Kramer,179," Yeah, but Jerry, what happens if the show's a hit? You could be out there for        years! You might never come",9,Seinfeld,113,21
35536,Jerry,179," No, I'll be back.",9,Seinfeld,18,4
35537,Kramer,179," Jerry. It's L.A. Nobody leaves. She's a seductress, she's a siren, she's a        virgin, she's a whore.",9,Seinfeld,105,17
35538,Jerry,179," And my agent said as a bonus, I can use their private jet, so we'll all go        somewhere - the four of us, one big fling before George and I go to California.",9,Seinfeld,162,33
35539,Kramer,179, Fling!,9,Seinfeld,7,1
35540,Elaine,179, So we can go anywhere we want?,9,Seinfeld,31,7
35541,Jerry,179, Anywhere.,9,Seinfeld,10,1
35542,Elaine,179, Why are they doing this?,9,Seinfeld,25,5
35543,Jerry,179, I think they want to make it up to us cause they let this thing sit on their        shelf for five years.,9,Seinfeld,106,22
35544,Elaine,179, This is all very exciting.,9,Seinfeld,27,5
35545,George,179, So? Where are we going?,9,Seinfeld,24,5
35546,Kramer,179, I say Japan.,9,Seinfeld,13,3
35547,Elaine,179, Why Japan?,9,Seinfeld,11,2
35548,Kramer,179," Oh - geishas - they cater to your every whim. They're shy at first, but they're        quite skilled at conversation. They can discuss anything from world affairs to the fine        art of fishing - or baking.",9,Seinfeld,210,36
35549,Elaine,179, Oh - I got it - how about Russia?,9,Seinfeld,34,9
35550,Jerry,179," Russia, it's so bleak.",9,Seinfeld,23,4
35551,Elaine,179, It's not bleak - it's springtime.,9,Seinfeld,34,6
35552,Jerry,179, It's still bleak.,9,Seinfeld,18,3
35553,Elaine,179, You can't be bleak in spring.,9,Seinfeld,30,6
35554,Jerry,179, You can be bleak in spring.,9,Seinfeld,28,6

35556,Elaine,179, What about Switzerland?,9,Seinfeld,24,3
35557,Kramer,179," Oh - Switzerland - the Von Trapp family, huh?",9,Seinfeld,46,9
35558,George,179, It's a bit hilly - no?,9,Seinfeld,23,6
35559,Elaine,179, You're not going to do any walking.,9,Seinfeld,36,7
35560,George,179, What if I want to walk around a little?,9,Seinfeld,40,9
35561,Elaine,179, So then you'll walk down the hill and we'll pick you up.,9,Seinfeld,57,12
35562,George,179, What if I'm at the bottom?,9,Seinfeld,27,6
35563,Elaine,179," All right! You know what, just forget it!",9,Seinfeld,42,8
35564,Jerry,179," Alright - come on - come on now, people. Let's face it, we're not all going to        agree on anything. ",9,Seinfeld,106,20
35565,Elaine,179, I'll go to Paris.,9,Seinfeld,18,4
35566,George,179, Me too.,9,Seinfeld,8,2
35567,Kramer,179, Oh yeah - oui oui.,9,Seinfeld,19,5
35568,Jerry,179," So that's it - it's settled, we're going to Paris.",9,Seinfeld,51,10
35570,Elaine,179, Hey. NBC limo is downstairs - beep beep beep. {NBC tune} I'm just going to call        Jill one more time before we go.,9,Seinfeld,120,23
35571,Jerry,179," Wait, you can't make a call like that on your way out. You can't rush that        conversation.",9,Seinfeld,96,17
35572,Elaine,179," Well, I can't call from the limo. Can I call from the plane?",9,Seinfeld,61,13
35573,Jerry,179," First you make a cell-phone walk-and-talk, then she loses a call-waiting        face-off, now you're talking about",9,Seinfeld,115,16
35574,Elaine,179," All right, I'll just have to call her from Paris.",9,Seinfeld,50,10
35576,Jerry,179," Hello, Newman. What gives?",9,Seinfeld,27,4
35578,Jerry,179," Yeah, that's right.",9,Seinfeld,20,3
35580,Jerry,179, Really.,9,Seinfeld,8,1
35582,Jerry,179, That's a shame.,9,Seinfeld,16,3
35584,Jerry,179," Oh, forget it. Pull yourself together. You're making me sick. Be a man!",9,Seinfeld,72,13
35587,Jerry,179, Yeah.,9,Seinfeld,6,1
35589,Jerry,179, All set. We'll just grab the bags.,9,Seinfeld,35,7
35591,Jerry,179, Just keeps on getting better and better.,9,Seinfeld,41,7
35592,Jerry,179, Not bad.,9,Seinfeld,9,2
35593,Elaine,179, Wow!,9,Seinfeld,5,1
35594,Kramer,179, The only way to fly.,9,Seinfeld,21,5
35595,George,179, This is it?,9,Seinfeld,12,3
35596,George,179," I'm sorry - I have to say, I'm a little disappointed, I thought it would be a        lot nicer.",9,Seinfeld,96,19
35597,Jerry,179, You're complaining about a private jet?,9,Seinfeld,40,6
35598,George,179, You think this is the plane that Ted Danson gets?,9,Seinfeld,50,10
35599,Jerry,179, Ted Danson is not even on the network anymore.,9,Seinfeld,47,9
35600,George,179," Still, I bet when they gave him a plane, it was a lot nicer than this one.",9,Seinfeld,75,17
35601,Elaine,179, Will you shut up? You are ruining the whole trip.,9,Seinfeld,50,10
35602,George,179, This is a real piece of junk. I don't even feel safe on this thing. I have a        good mind to write a letter toMr. Kimbrough.,9,Seinfeld,129,26
35603,Jerry,179, You're not writing any letters!,9,Seinfeld,32,5
35604,Elaine,179, Will you turn around?,9,Seinfeld,22,4
35605,George,179, Why?,9,Seinfeld,5,1
35606,Elaine,179, You are annoying me sitting like that. It's effeminate.,9,Seinfeld,56,9
35607,George,179, It's effeminate to sit like this? ,9,Seinfeld,35,6
35608,Elaine,179," Yes, I think it's a little effeminate.",9,Seinfeld,39,7
35609,George,179, How is this effeminate?,9,Seinfeld,24,4
35610,Elaine,179, I don't know - it just is.,9,Seinfeld,27,7
35611,George,179," Kramer, what are you doing?",9,Seinfeld,28,5
35612,Jerry,179, Still got water in your ear?,9,Seinfeld,29,6
35613,Kramer,179, Can't get rid of it. Maybe it leaked inside my brain.,9,Seinfeld,54,11
35614,George,179, Would you stop that? It's not safe to be jumping up and down on a plane.,9,Seinfeld,73,16
35615,Kramer,179," I got to get it out, I can't take this anymore.",9,Seinfeld,48,11
35616,George,179," Kramer, don't be fooling around up here.",9,Seinfeld,41,7
35617,George,179, Kramer!,9,Seinfeld,8,1
35619,Elaine,179, What is that?,9,Seinfeld,14,3

35623,Kramer,179, I lost my balance.,9,Seinfeld,19,4
35624,Elaine,179, Oh my God!,9,Seinfeld,11,3
35625,Elaine,179, What's going on?,9,Seinfeld,17,3
35626,Jerry,179, Kramer!,9,Seinfeld,8,1
35627,Kramer,179, It was an accident.,9,Seinfeld,20,4
35628,George,179, I told you to stop with the hopping.,9,Seinfeld,37,8
35629,Elaine,179," Oh my God, we're going down. We're going to die!",9,Seinfeld,49,10
35630,George,179, Just when I was doing great. I told you God wouldn't let me be successful.,9,Seinfeld,75,15
35631,Jerry,179, Is this it? Is this how it ends? It can't- it can't end like this.,9,Seinfeld,67,15
35632,Kramer,179, I'm ready! I'm ready! Glory hallelujah!,9,Seinfeld,40,6
35633,George,179, Jerry? Jerry can you hear me?,9,Seinfeld,30,6
35634,Jerry,179, Yeah.,9,Seinfeld,6,1
35635,George,179, There's something I have to tell you.,9,Seinfeld,38,7
35636,Jerry,179, What? What is it?,9,Seinfeld,18,4
35637,George,179, I cheated in the contest.,9,Seinfeld,26,5
35638,Elaine,179, What?,9,Seinfeld,6,1
35639,Jerry,179, What?,9,Seinfeld,6,1
35640,George,179, The contest - I cheated.,9,Seinfeld,25,5
35641,Jerry,179, Why?,9,Seinfeld,5,1
35642,George,179, Because I'm a cheater! I had to tell you.,9,Seinfeld,42,9
35643,Jerry,179, Great - I won.,9,Seinfeld,15,4
35644,Elaine,179," Jerry, I gotta tell you something too.",9,Seinfeld,39,7
35645,Jerry,179," Yeah, Elaine I got something I want to say to you.",9,Seinfeld,51,11
35646,Elaine,179, No no - me first.,9,Seinfeld,18,5

35658,Jerry,179, Okay.,9,Seinfeld,6,1
35659,Elaine,179, Okay.,9,Seinfeld,6,1
35660,Jerry,179, We'll see you later.,9,Seinfeld,21,4
35661,Elaine,179," Well, what are we going to do about Paris? I mean are we actually going to get        back on this plane?",9,Seinfeld,106,21
35662,Jerry,179," I say we go back to New York, and take a regular flight.",9,Seinfeld,57,13
35663,George,179, I'm not getting on a regular plane now - I'm all psyched up to go on a private        jet. No way I'm getting on a regular plane.,9,Seinfeld,130,27
35664,Elaine,179," Well, I'm sure that they would fly us first class.",9,Seinfeld,51,10
35665,George,179," First class doesn't make it anymore. Now you get on the phone with Kimbrough,        tell him what happened and tell him to get another plane down here, but this time, the        good one - the Ted Danson plane.",9,Seinfeld,212,38
35666,Jerry,179," Alright, I'll feel him out.",9,Seinfeld,28,5

35674,Jerry,179," Well, there goes the money for the lipo.",9,Seinfeld,41,8
35675,Elaine,179," See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it's an easy getaway. You know?        They can't really chase ya!",9,Seinfeld,115,21
35676,George,179, He's actually doing him a favor. It's less money for him to buy food.,9,Seinfeld,70,14
35678,Jerry,179," That's a shame. Alright, I'm gonna call NBC.",9,Seinfeld,45,8
35680,Jerry,179," Okay, thanks anyway. They can't get another plane.",9,Seinfeld,51,8
35681,Kramer,179," All right, what's wrong with the plane we got? They're just checking it out.",9,Seinfeld,77,14
35682,Elaine,179, Forget it.,9,Seinfeld,11,2
35683,Jerry,179," No, no, no. We're not getting on there. Come on, let's go get something to eat        in Sticksville.",9,Seinfeld,102,18
35685,Kramer,179, What?,9,Seinfeld,6,1

35689,Elaine,179," What? No, no - we didn't do anything.",9,Seinfeld,38,8
35691,Elaine,179, The Good Samaritan Law? Are they crazy?,9,Seinfeld,40,7
35692,George,179, Why would we want to help somebody?,9,Seinfeld,36,7
35693,Elaine,179, I know.,9,Seinfeld,8,2
35694,George,179, That's what nuns and Red Cross workers are for.,9,Seinfeld,48,9
35695,Kramer,179, The Samaritans were an ancient tribe - very helpful to people.,9,Seinfeld,63,11
35696,Elaine,179," Alright - um, excuse me, hi, could you tell me what kind of law this is.",9,Seinfeld,73,16
35698,Jerry,179," Oh, yeah.",9,Seinfeld,10,2
35699,Elaine,179," Oh, yeah.",9,Seinfeld,10,2
35701,George,179," All right, so what's the penalty here? Let's just pay the fine or something and        get the hell out of here.",9,Seinfeld,113,21
35703,Elaine,179, What?,9,Seinfeld,6,1
35704,George,179, Oh no no no no - we have to be in California next week. We're starting a TV        show.,9,Seinfeld,89,19
35711,Kramer,179," Mmmm, this is pretty good chow, huh?",9,Seinfeld,37,7
35712,George,179," Would it kill him to check up on us? No - drops off the meals and that's it. I        realize we're prisoners, but we're still entitled to catsup.",9,Seinfeld,147,28
35713,Elaine,179, I guess we could've called for help.,9,Seinfeld,37,7
35714,Jerry,179, But then we would have missed the whole thing.,9,Seinfeld,47,9
35715,Kramer,179, I still had it on video. We could have watched it later.,9,Seinfeld,57,12
35716,George,179," Yeah, he's right.",9,Seinfeld,18,3
35717,Jerry,179, I forgot about the video.,9,Seinfeld,26,5
35718,Elaine,179, Sure - the video.,9,Seinfeld,18,4
35719,Elaine,179, What is that?,9,Seinfeld,14,3
35720,Jerry,179, Plane's ready.,9,Seinfeld,15,2
35746,Kramer,179," This is excellent huh? Don't worry I didn't use too much milk, cause I know we        gotta make it last.",9,Seinfeld,106,20
35747,Jerry,179," You know I've had to reduce my milk level. My whole life I've always filled to        at least three quarters - sometimes, to the top of the cereal. Now, to conserve, I can't        even see the milk anymore. It's a big adjustment.",9,Seinfeld,232,42
35748,Kramer,179, I bet.,9,Seinfeld,7,2
35749,Jerry,179, It's one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.,9,Seinfeld,52,11
35751,Elaine,179," Good morning, Jackie.",9,Seinfeld,22,3
35752,Jerry,179, Good morning.,9,Seinfeld,14,2

35768,Elaine,179," Jackie says put it on, Jerry.",9,Seinfeld,30,6
35770,George,179, Vandelay? The judge's name is Vandelay?,9,Seinfeld,40,6
35772,George,179," Jerry, did you hear that?",9,Seinfeld,26,5
35773,Jerry,179, Yeah.,9,Seinfeld,6,1
35774,George,179, I think that's a good sign.,9,Seinfeld,28,6

35849,Jerry,179," That's right, the Bubble Boy.",9,Seinfeld,30,5
35851,Jerry,179, He's a boy who lives in a bubble.,9,Seinfeld,34,8
35855,George,179, Who invaded Spain in the Eighth Century?,9,Seinfeld,41,7

35915,George,179, Fire! Get out of the way!,9,Seinfeld,26,6
35918,Jerry,179, Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger? I know it's against the law.,9,Seinfeld,78,17
35920,Jerry,179, Because I could get uromycitisis poisoning and die - that's why.,9,Seinfeld,65,11
35928,Kramer,179," Cool it, lady. Cool it. Cool it, lady. Cool it.",9,Seinfeld,48,10

36004,Kramer,179, Will you stop worrying? Jackie's going to get us off. He never loses. How about        when he asked that cop ,9,Seinfeld,111,20
36015,Jerry,179," Hey Elaine, what was it you were about to say to me on the plane when it was        going down?",9,Seinfeld,96,20
36016,Elaine,179, I've always loved ... United Airlines.,9,Seinfeld,39,6
36017,Kramer,179, I think it's going to be okay - that girl just smiled at me.,9,Seinfeld,61,14

36057,Jerry,179," Alright, hey, you've been great! See you in the cafeteria.",9,Seinfeld,59,10
36058,Jerry,180," It seems like whenever these office people call you in for a meeting,         the whole thing is about the sitting down. I would really like to sit         down with you. I think we need to sit down and talk. Why don't you come         in, and we'll sit down. Well, sometimes the sitting down doesn't work.         People get mad at the sitting.You know, we've been sitting here for I         don't know how long. How much longer are we just going to sit here? I'll         tell you what I think we should do. I think we should all sleep on it.         Maybe we're not getting down low enough. Maybe if we all lie down, then         our brains will work.",9,Seinfeld,655,117
36059,George,180," I can't eat this without catsup. Would it kill her to check up on us? Would        that be a terrible thing? ""How's everything? Do you need anything? What can I do for        you?""",9,Seinfeld,181,33

36106,George,180, On-the-street cell-phone call is the lowest phone call you can make.,9,Seinfeld,69,11
36107,Jerry,180, It's an act of total disregard. It's selfish.,9,Seinfeld,46,8
36108,George,180, It's dismissive.,9,Seinfeld,17,2
36109,Jerry,180, It's pompous.,9,Seinfeld,14,2

36117,George,180, You're so uptight.,9,Seinfeld,19,3

36272,George,180, It's a bit hilly - no?,9,Seinfeld,23,6
36273,Elaine,180, You're not going to do any walking.,9,Seinfeld,36,7
36274,George,180, What if I want to walk around a little?,9,Seinfeld,40,9
36275,Elaine,180, So then you'll walk down the hill and we'll pick you up.,9,Seinfeld,57,12
36276,George,180, What if I'm at the bottom?,9,Seinfeld,27,6
36277,Elaine,180," All right! You know what, just forget it!",9,Seinfeld,42,8
36278,Jerry,180," Alright - come on - come on now, people. Let's face it, we're not all going to        agree on anything. ",9,Seinfeld,106,20
36279,Elaine,180, I'll go to Paris.,9,Seinfeld,18,4
36280,George,180, Me too.,9,Seinfeld,8,2
36281,Kramer,180, Oh yeah - oui oui.,9,Seinfeld,19,5
36282,Jerry,180," So that's it - it's settled, we're going to Paris.",9,Seinfeld,51,10
36284,Elaine,180, Hey. NBC limo is downstairs - beep beep beep. {NBC tune} I'm just going to call        Jill one more time before we go.,9,Seinfeld,120,23
36285,Jerry,180," Wait, you can't make a call like that on your way out. You can't rush that        conversation.",9,Seinfeld,96,17
36286,Elaine,180," Well, I can't call from the limo. Can I call from the plane?",9,Seinfeld,61,13
36287,Jerry,180," First you make a cell-phone walk-and-talk, then she loses a call-waiting        face-off, now you're talking about",9,Seinfeld,115,16
36288,Elaine,180," All right, I'll just have to call her from Paris.",9,Seinfeld,50,10
36290,Jerry,180," Hello, Newman. What gives?",9,Seinfeld,27,4
36292,Jerry,180," Yeah, that's right.",9,Seinfeld,20,3
36294,Jerry,180, Really.,9,Seinfeld,8,1
36296,Jerry,180, That's a shame.,9,Seinfeld,16,3
36298,Jerry,180," Oh, forget it. Pull yourself together. You're making me sick. Be a man!",9,Seinfeld,72,13
36301,Jerry,180, Yeah.,9,Seinfeld,6,1
36303,Jerry,180, All set. We'll just grab the bags.,9,Seinfeld,35,7
36305,Jerry,180, Just keeps on getting better and better.,9,Seinfeld,41,7
36306,Jerry,180, Not bad.,9,Seinfeld,9,2
36307,Elaine,180, Wow!,9,Seinfeld,5,1
36308,Kramer,180, The only way to fly.,9,Seinfeld,21,5
36309,George,180, This is it?,9,Seinfeld,12,3
36310,George,180," I'm sorry - I have to say, I'm a little disappointed, I thought it would be a        lot nicer.",9,Seinfeld,96,19
36311,Jerry,180, You're complaining about a private jet?,9,Seinfeld,40,6
36312,George,180, You think this is the plane that Ted Danson gets?,9,Seinfeld,50,10
36313,Jerry,180, Ted Danson is not even on the network anymore.,9,Seinfeld,47,9
36314,George,180," Still, I bet when they gave him a plane, it was a lot nicer than this one.",9,Seinfeld,75,17
36315,Elaine,180, Will you shut up? You are ruining the whole trip.,9,Seinfeld,50,10
36316,George,180, This is a real piece of junk. I don't even feel safe on this thing. I have a        good mind to write a letter toMr. Kimbrough.,9,Seinfeld,129,26
36317,Jerry,180, You're not writing any letters!,9,Seinfeld,32,5
36318,Elaine,180, Will you turn around?,9,Seinfeld,22,4
36319,George,180, Why?,9,Seinfeld,5,1
36320,Elaine,180, You are annoying me sitting like that. It's effeminate.,9,Seinfeld,56,9
36321,George,180, It's effeminate to sit like this? ,9,Seinfeld,35,6
36322,Elaine,180," Yes, I think it's a little effeminate.",9,Seinfeld,39,7
36323,George,180, How is this effeminate?,9,Seinfeld,24,4
36324,Elaine,180, I don't know - it just is.,9,Seinfeld,27,7
36325,George,180," Kramer, what are you doing?",9,Seinfeld,28,5
36326,Jerry,180, Still got water in your ear?,9,Seinfeld,29,6
36327,Kramer,180, Can't get rid of it. Maybe it leaked inside my brain.,9,Seinfeld,54,11
36328,George,180, Would you stop that? It's not safe to be jumping up and down on a plane.,9,Seinfeld,73,16
36329,Kramer,180," I got to get it out, I can't take this anymore.",9,Seinfeld,48,11
36330,George,180," Kramer, don't be fooling around up here.",9,Seinfeld,41,7
36331,George,180, Kramer!,9,Seinfeld,8,1
36333,Elaine,180, What is that?,9,Seinfeld,14,3
36334,George,180, Oh my God!,9,Seinfeld,11,3
36335,Elaine,180, What is that noise? What is that noise?,9,Seinfeld,40,8
36336,Jerry,180," Kramer, what the hell did you do?",9,Seinfeld,34,7
36337,Kramer,180, I lost my balance.,9,Seinfeld,19,4
36338,Elaine,180, Oh my God!,9,Seinfeld,11,3
36339,Elaine,180, What's going on?,9,Seinfeld,17,3
36340,Jerry,180, Kramer!,9,Seinfeld,8,1
36341,Kramer,180, It was an accident.,9,Seinfeld,20,4
36342,George,180, I told you to stop with the hopping.,9,Seinfeld,37,8
36343,Elaine,180," Oh my God, we're going down. We're going to die!",9,Seinfeld,49,10
36344,George,180, Just when I was doing great. I told you God wouldn't let me be successful.,9,Seinfeld,75,15
36345,Jerry,180, Is this it? Is this how it ends? It can't- it can't end like this.,9,Seinfeld,67,15
36346,Kramer,180, I'm ready! I'm ready! Glory hallelujah!,9,Seinfeld,40,6
36347,George,180, Jerry? Jerry can you hear me?,9,Seinfeld,30,6
36348,Jerry,180, Yeah.,9,Seinfeld,6,1
36349,George,180, There's something I have to tell you.,9,Seinfeld,38,7
36350,Jerry,180, What? What is it?,9,Seinfeld,18,4
36351,George,180, I cheated in the contest.,9,Seinfeld,26,5
36352,Elaine,180, What?,9,Seinfeld,6,1
36353,Jerry,180, What?,9,Seinfeld,6,1
36354,George,180, The contest - I cheated.,9,Seinfeld,25,5
36355,Jerry,180, Why?,9,Seinfeld,5,1
36356,George,180, Because I'm a cheater! I had to tell you.,9,Seinfeld,42,9
36357,Jerry,180, Great - I won.,9,Seinfeld,15,4
36358,Elaine,180," Jerry, I gotta tell you something too.",9,Seinfeld,39,7
36359,Jerry,180," Yeah, Elaine I got something I want to say to you.",9,Seinfeld,51,11
36360,Elaine,180, No no - me first.,9,Seinfeld,18,5
36361,Jerry,180, Alright.,9,Seinfeld,9,1
36362,Elaine,180," Jerry, I've always loved ..u..",9,Seinfeld,31,5
36363,George,180, Hey - What's going on?,9,Seinfeld,23,5
36364,Kramer,180, We're straightening out!,9,Seinfeld,25,3
36365,Elaine,180, We're straightening out?,9,Seinfeld,25,3
36366,Jerry,180, We're straightening out!,9,Seinfeld,25,3
36367,George,180, We're straightening out!,9,Seinfeld,25,3
36370,Jerry,180, Where are we?,9,Seinfeld,14,3
36372,Jerry,180, Okay.,9,Seinfeld,6,1
36373,Elaine,180, Okay.,9,Seinfeld,6,1
36374,Jerry,180, We'll see you later.,9,Seinfeld,21,4
36375,Elaine,180," Well, what are we going to do about Paris? I mean are we actually going to get        back on this plane?",9,Seinfeld,106,21
36376,Jerry,180," I say we go back to New York, and take a regular flight.",9,Seinfeld,57,13
36377,George,180, I'm not getting on a regular plane now - I'm all psyched up to go on a private        jet. No way I'm getting on a regular plane.,9,Seinfeld,130,27
36378,Elaine,180," Well, I'm sure that they would fly us first class.",9,Seinfeld,51,10
36379,George,180," First class doesn't make it anymore. Now you get on the phone with Kimbrough,        tell him what happened and tell him to get another plane down here, but this time, the        good one - the Ted Danson plane.",9,Seinfeld,212,38
36380,Jerry,180," Alright, I'll feel him out.",9,Seinfeld,28,5
36381,George,180," Yeah, just tell him to hurry it up.",9,Seinfeld,36,8
36383,Jerry,180, Another one?,9,Seinfeld,13,2
36385,Kramer,180, I want to capture this.,9,Seinfeld,24,5
36388,Jerry,180," Well, there goes the money for the lipo.",9,Seinfeld,41,8
36389,Elaine,180," See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it's an easy getaway. You know?        They can't really chase ya!",9,Seinfeld,115,21
36390,George,180, He's actually doing him a favor. It's less money for him to buy food.,9,Seinfeld,70,14
36392,Jerry,180," That's a shame. Alright, I'm gonna call NBC.",9,Seinfeld,45,8
36394,Jerry,180," Okay, thanks anyway. They can't get another plane.",9,Seinfeld,51,8
36395,Kramer,180," All right, what's wrong with the plane we got? They're just checking it out.",9,Seinfeld,77,14
36396,Elaine,180, Forget it.,9,Seinfeld,11,2
36397,Jerry,180," No, no, no. We're not getting on there. Come on, let's go get something to eat        in Sticksville.",9,Seinfeld,102,18
36399,Kramer,180, What?,9,Seinfeld,6,1
36401,Jerry,180, Under arrest? What for?,9,Seinfeld,24,4
36403,Elaine,180," What? No, no - we didn't do anything.",9,Seinfeld,38,8
36405,Elaine,180, The Good Samaritan Law? Are they crazy?,9,Seinfeld,40,7
36406,George,180, Why would we want to help somebody?,9,Seinfeld,36,7
36407,Elaine,180, I know.,9,Seinfeld,8,2
36408,George,180, That's what nuns and Red Cross workers are for.,9,Seinfeld,48,9
36409,Kramer,180, The Samaritans were an ancient tribe - very helpful to people.,9,Seinfeld,63,11
36410,Elaine,180," Alright - um, excuse me, hi, could you tell me what kind of law this is.",9,Seinfeld,73,16
36412,Jerry,180," Oh, yeah.",9,Seinfeld,10,2
36413,Elaine,180," Oh, yeah.",9,Seinfeld,10,2
36415,George,180," All right, so what's the penalty here? Let's just pay the fine or something and        get the hell out of here.",9,Seinfeld,113,21
36417,Elaine,180, What?,9,Seinfeld,6,1
36418,George,180, Oh no no no no - we have to be in California next week. We're starting a TV        show.,9,Seinfeld,89,19
36425,Kramer,180," Mmmm, this is pretty good chow, huh?",9,Seinfeld,37,7
36426,George,180," Would it kill him to check up on us? No - drops off the meals and that's it. I        realize we're prisoners, but we're still entitled to catsup.",9,Seinfeld,147,28
36427,Elaine,180, I guess we could've called for help.,9,Seinfeld,37,7
36428,Jerry,180, But then we would have missed the whole thing.,9,Seinfeld,47,9
36429,Kramer,180, I still had it on video. We could have watched it later.,9,Seinfeld,57,12
36430,George,180," Yeah, he's right.",9,Seinfeld,18,3
36431,Jerry,180, I forgot about the video.,9,Seinfeld,26,5
36432,Elaine,180, Sure - the video.,9,Seinfeld,18,4
36433,Elaine,180, What is that?,9,Seinfeld,14,3
36434,Jerry,180, Plane's ready.,9,Seinfeld,15,2
36460,Kramer,180," This is excellent huh? Don't worry I didn't use too much milk, cause I know we        gotta make it last.",9,Seinfeld,106,20
36461,Jerry,180," You know I've had to reduce my milk level. My whole life I've always filled to        at least three quarters - sometimes, to the top of the cereal. Now, to conserve, I can't        even see the milk anymore. It's a big adjustment.",9,Seinfeld,232,42
36462,Kramer,180, I bet.,9,Seinfeld,7,2
36463,Jerry,180, It's one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.,9,Seinfeld,52,11
36465,Elaine,180," Good morning, Jackie.",9,Seinfeld,22,3
36466,Jerry,180, Good morning.,9,Seinfeld,14,2
36468,George,180, It makes me look older.,9,Seinfeld,24,5
36471,Jerry,180, No.,9,Seinfeld,4,1
36473,Elaine,180," How do I look, Jackie?",9,Seinfeld,23,5
36475,Elaine,180," Thank you, Jackie.",9,Seinfeld,19,3
36476,Kramer,180," How bout me, Jackie?",9,Seinfeld,21,4
36479,Jerry,180, This one?,9,Seinfeld,10,2
36481,Jerry,180, Do I have to?,9,Seinfeld,14,4
36482,Elaine,180," Jackie says put it on, Jerry.",9,Seinfeld,30,6
36484,George,180, Vandelay? The judge's name is Vandelay?,9,Seinfeld,40,6
36486,George,180," Jerry, did you hear that?",9,Seinfeld,26,5
36487,Jerry,180, Yeah.,9,Seinfeld,6,1
36488,George,180, I think that's a good sign.,9,Seinfeld,28,6
36505,Jerry,180," Well, there goes the money for the lipo.",9,Seinfeld,41,8
36506,Elaine,180," See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it's an easy getaway. They        can't really chase ya!",9,Seinfeld,105,19
36507,George,180, He's actually doing him a favor. It's less money for him to buy food.,9,Seinfeld,70,14
36512,George,180, Hey! Great plane! Thanks a lot. Piece of junk. You know you almost got us        killed!,9,Seinfeld,89,16
36529,Jerry,180, Gimme that rye.,9,Seinfeld,16,3
36531,Jerry,180, I want that rye lady.,9,Seinfeld,22,5
36533,Jerry,180," Shut up, you old bag!",9,Seinfeld,22,5
36537,Jerry,180, The virgin!,9,Seinfeld,12,2
36559,Jerry,180, Who the hell is that?,9,Seinfeld,22,5
36561,George,180, The Bubble Boy!,9,Seinfeld,16,3
36563,Jerry,180," That's right, the Bubble Boy.",9,Seinfeld,30,5
36565,Jerry,180, He's a boy who lives in a bubble.,9,Seinfeld,34,8
36569,George,180, Who invaded Spain in the Eighth Century?,9,Seinfeld,41,7
36571,George,180," Oh no - I'm so sorry, it's the Moops. The correct answer is the Moops.",9,Seinfeld,71,15
36573,George,180," Sorry, the card says Moops.",9,Seinfeld,28,5
36575,George,180, It's Moops.,9,Seinfeld,12,2
36577,George,180, Moops!,9,Seinfeld,7,1

36606,Elaine,180," Oh, hi, I'm Elaine.",9,Seinfeld,20,4
36629,George,180, Fire! Get out of the way!,9,Seinfeld,26,6
36632,Jerry,180, Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger? I know it's against the law.,9,Seinfeld,78,17
36634,Jerry,180, Because I could get uromycitisis poisoning and die - that's why.,9,Seinfeld,65,11
36642,Kramer,180," Cool it, lady. Cool it. Cool it, lady. Cool it.",9,Seinfeld,48,10
36654,George,180," Yes, sir, that was a good sandwich, sir.",9,Seinfeld,41,8
36672,Jerry,180, Who?,9,Seinfeld,5,1

36685,George,180," Um, excuse me, I think you forgot my bread.",9,Seinfeld,44,9
36687,George,180," Yes, please.",9,Seinfeld,13,2
36689,George,180, What?,9,Seinfeld,6,1

36694,Elaine,180," You're through, Soup Nazi. Pack it up. No more soup for you. Next!",9,Seinfeld,67,13
36696,Elaine,180, Soup's not all that good anyway.,9,Seinfeld,33,6
36699,Jerry,180, How did they find Babu?,9,Seinfeld,24,5
36700,Elaine,180, I thought he was deported.,9,Seinfeld,27,5
36714,Jerry,180, Do they make you wear uniforms in prison?,9,Seinfeld,42,8
36715,Elaine,180, I think so.,9,Seinfeld,12,3
36716,Jerry,180, It's not that bright orange one is it?,9,Seinfeld,39,8
36717,Elaine,180," I hope it's not that one, because I cannot wear orange.",9,Seinfeld,56,11
36718,Kramer,180, Will you stop worrying? Jackie's going to get us off. He never loses. How about        when he asked that cop ,9,Seinfeld,111,20
36729,Jerry,180," Hey Elaine, what was it you were about to say to me on the plane when it was        going down?",9,Seinfeld,96,20
36730,Elaine,180, I've always loved ... United Airlines.,9,Seinfeld,39,6
36731,Kramer,180, I think it's going to be okay - that girl just smiled at me.,9,Seinfeld,61,14
36732,Jerry,180, Maybe because she knows you're going to jail.,9,Seinfeld,46,8
36739,George,180, You had to hop! You had to hop on the plane.,9,Seinfeld,45,11
36740,Elaine,180," Puddy, don't wait for me.",9,Seinfeld,26,5

36747,Kramer,180," Could be fun. Don't have to worry about your meals, or what you're going to do        Saturday night. And they do shows. Yeah, we could put on a show - maybe ""Bye Bye        Birdie"" or ""My Fair Lady"". Elaine, you could be Liza Doolittle.",9,Seinfeld,238,44
36748,Elaine,180, Why don't you just blow it out your...,9,Seinfeld,39,8
36749,Elaine,180," If I call Jill from prison, do you think that would make up for the other ones?",9,Seinfeld,80,17
36750,Jerry,180, Sure.,9,Seinfeld,6,1
36751,Elaine,180, Cause you only get one call. The prison call is like the king of calls.,9,Seinfeld,72,15
36752,Jerry,180, I think that would be a very nice gesture.,9,Seinfeld,43,9
36753,Kramer,180," I got it - it's out! How about that, huh? Oh, boy, what a relief.",9,Seinfeld,66,15
36754,Jerry,180," See now, to me, that button is in the worst possible spot.",9,Seinfeld,59,12
36755,George,180, Really?,9,Seinfeld,8,1
36756,Jerry,180," Oh yeah. The second button is the key button. It literally makes or breaks the        shirt. Look at it, it's ",9,Seinfeld,111,20
36757,George,180, Haven't we had this conversation before?,9,Seinfeld,41,6
36758,Jerry,180, You think?,9,Seinfeld,11,2
36759,George,180, I think we have.,9,Seinfeld,17,4

36763,Jerry,180," I'll talk slower. I'm kidding - I love Cellblock D. My friend George is in        Cellblock D. What are you in for,sir?",9,Seinfeld,120,22
36765,Jerry,180," Murder one? Oooooo, watch out everybody. Better be nice to you. I'm only kidding        sir - lighten up. How about ",9,Seinfeld,117,20
36767,Jerry,180, Grand theft auto - don't steal any of my jokes.,9,Seinfeld,48,10
36769,Jerry,180," Hey, I don't come down to where you work, and knock the license plate out of        your hand.",9,Seinfeld,95,18
36771,Jerry,180," Alright, hey, you've been great! See you in the cafeteria.",9,Seinfeld,59,10
