1,Sheldon,1," So if a photon is directed through a plane with two slits in it and either slit is observed it will not go through both slits. If it's unobserved it will, however, if it's observed after it's left the plane but before it hits its target, it will not have gone through both slits.",1,Big Bang Theory,280,54
2,Leonard,1," Agreed, what's your point?",1,Big Bang Theory,27,4
3,Sheldon,1," There's no point, I just think it's a good idea for a tee-shirt. ",1,Big Bang Theory,66,13
4,Leonard,1, Excuse me?,1,Big Bang Theory,11,2
6,Leonard,1," One across is Aegean, eight down is Nabakov, twenty-six across is MCM, fourteen down is move your finger phylum, which makes fourteen across Port-au-Prince. See, Papa Doc's capital idea, that's Port-au-Prince. Haiti. ",1,Big Bang Theory,218,32
8,Leonard,1," Yes. Um, is this the High IQ sperm bank?",1,Big Bang Theory,41,9
10,Sheldon,1, I think this is the place.,1,Big Bang Theory,27,6
12,Leonard,1, Thank-you. We'll be right back.,1,Big Bang Theory,32,5
14,Sheldon,1," Leonard, I don't think I can do this.",1,Big Bang Theory,38,8
15,Leonard,1," What, are you kidding? You're a semi-pro. ",1,Big Bang Theory,43,7
16,Sheldon,1," No. We are committing genetic fraud. There's no guarantee that our sperm is going to generate high IQ offspring, think about that. I have a sister with the same basic DNA mix who hostesses at Fuddruckers.",1,Big Bang Theory,205,36
17,Leonard,1," Sheldon, this was your idea. A little extra money to get fractional T1 bandwidth in the apartment.",1,Big Bang Theory,99,17
18,Sheldon,1," I know, and I do yearn for faster downloads, but there's some poor woman is going to pin her hopes on my sperm, what if she winds up with a toddler who doesn't know if he should use an integral or a differential to solve the area under a curve.",1,Big Bang Theory,245,50
19,Leonard,1, I'm sure she'll still love him.,1,Big Bang Theory,32,6
20,Sheldon,1, I wouldn't.,1,Big Bang Theory,12,2
21,Leonard,1," Well, what do you want to do?",1,Big Bang Theory,30,7
22,Sheldon,1, I want to leave.,1,Big Bang Theory,17,4
23,Leonard,1, Okay.,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
24,Sheldon,1, What's the protocol for leaving?,1,Big Bang Theory,33,5
25,Leonard,1," I don't know, I've never reneged on a proffer of sperm before.",1,Big Bang Theory,63,12
26,Sheldon,1, Let's try just walking out.,1,Big Bang Theory,28,5
27,Sheldon,1, Bye-bye,1,Big Bang Theory,8,1
28,Leonard,1, See you.,1,Big Bang Theory,9,2
30,Sheldon,1, Are you still mad about the sperm bank?,1,Big Bang Theory,40,8
31,Leonard,1, No.,1,Big Bang Theory,4,1
32,Sheldon,1, You want to hear an interesting thing about stairs?,1,Big Bang Theory,52,9
33,Leonard,1, Not really.,1,Big Bang Theory,12,2
34,Sheldon,1," If the height of a single step is off by as little as two millimetres, most people will trip.",1,Big Bang Theory,94,19
35,Leonard,1, I don't care. Two millimetres? That doesn't seem right.,1,Big Bang Theory,56,9
36,Sheldon,1," No, it's true, I did a series of experiments when I was twelve, my father broke his clavicle.",1,Big Bang Theory,94,18
37,Leonard,1, Is that why they sent you to boarding school?,1,Big Bang Theory,46,9
38,Sheldon,1," No, that was the result of my work with lasers.",1,Big Bang Theory,48,10
39,Leonard,1, New neighbour?,1,Big Bang Theory,15,2
40,Sheldon,1, Evidently.,1,Big Bang Theory,11,1
41,Leonard,1, Significant improvement over the old neighbour.,1,Big Bang Theory,48,6
42,Sheldon,1," Two hundred pound transvestite with a skin condition, yes she is.",1,Big Bang Theory,66,11
43,Penny,1," Oh, hi!",1,Big Bang Theory,8,2
44,Leonard,1, Hi.,1,Big Bang Theory,4,1
45,Sheldon,1, Hi.,1,Big Bang Theory,4,1
46,Leonard,1, Hi.,1,Big Bang Theory,4,1
47,Sheldon,1, Hi.,1,Big Bang Theory,4,1
48,Penny,1, Hi?,1,Big Bang Theory,4,1
49,Leonard,1," We don't mean to interrupt, we live across the hall.",1,Big Bang Theory,53,10
50,Penny,1," Oh, that's nice.",1,Big Bang Theory,17,3
51,Leonard,1," Oh uh no we don't live together um we live together but in separate, heterosexual bedrooms.",1,Big Bang Theory,92,16
52,Penny,1," Oh, okay, well, guess I'm your new neighbour, Penny.",1,Big Bang Theory,53,9
53,Leonard,1," Leonard, Sheldon.",1,Big Bang Theory,18,2
54,Penny,1, Hi.,1,Big Bang Theory,4,1
55,Leonard,1, Hi.,1,Big Bang Theory,4,1
56,Sheldon,1, Hi.,1,Big Bang Theory,4,1
57,Penny,1, Hi. ,1,Big Bang Theory,5,1
58,Leonard,1," Hi. Well, uh, oh, welcome to the building.",1,Big Bang Theory,43,8
59,Penny,1," Thankyou, maybe we can have coffee sometime.",1,Big Bang Theory,45,7
60,Leonard,1," Oh, great.",1,Big Bang Theory,11,2
61,Penny,1, Great. ,1,Big Bang Theory,8,1
62,Sheldon,1, Great.,1,Big Bang Theory,7,1
63,Leonard,1," Great. Well, bye.",1,Big Bang Theory,18,3
64,Penny,1, Bye.,1,Big Bang Theory,5,1
65,Sheldon,1, Bye.,1,Big Bang Theory,5,1
66,Leonard,1, Bye. ,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
67,Leonard,1, Should we have invited her for lunch?,1,Big Bang Theory,38,7
68,Sheldon,1, No. We're going to start Season Two of Battlestar Galactica.,1,Big Bang Theory,61,10
69,Leonard,1, We already watched the Season Two DVDs.,1,Big Bang Theory,40,7
70,Sheldon,1, Not with commentary.,1,Big Bang Theory,21,3
71,Leonard,1," I think we should be good neighbours, invite her over, make her feel welcome.",1,Big Bang Theory,78,14
72,Sheldon,1, We never invited Louis-slash-Louise over.,1,Big Bang Theory,42,5
73,Leonard,1," Well, then that was wrong of us. We need to widen our circle.",1,Big Bang Theory,62,13
74,Sheldon,1, I have a very wide circle. I have 212 friends on myspace. ,1,Big Bang Theory,59,12
75,Leonard,1," Yes, and you've never met one of them.",1,Big Bang Theory,39,8
76,Sheldon,1, That's the beauty of it.,1,Big Bang Theory,25,5
77,Leonard,1, I'm going to invite her over. We'll have a nice meal and chat.,1,Big Bang Theory,63,13
78,Sheldon,1, Chat? We don't chat. At least not offline.,1,Big Bang Theory,43,8
79,Leonard,1," Well it's not difficult, you just listen to what she says and then you say something appropriate in response.",1,Big Bang Theory,110,19
80,Sheldon,1, To what end?,1,Big Bang Theory,13,3
81,Leonard,1, Hi. Again.,1,Big Bang Theory,11,2
82,Penny,1, Hi.,1,Big Bang Theory,4,1
83,Sheldon,1, Hi.,1,Big Bang Theory,4,1
84,Leonard,1, Hi.,1,Big Bang Theory,4,1
85,Penny,1, Hi. ,1,Big Bang Theory,5,1
86,Leonard,1," Anyway, um. We brought home Indian food. And, um. I know that moving can be stressful, and I find that when I'm undergoing stress, that good food and company can have a comforting effect. Also, curry is a natural laxative, and I don't have to tell you that, uh, a clean colon is just one less thing to worry about.",1,Big Bang Theory,315,60
87,Sheldon,1," Leonard, I'm not expert here but I believe in the context of a luncheon invitation, you might want to skip the reference to bowel movements.",1,Big Bang Theory,141,25
88,Penny,1," Oh, you're inviting me over to eat?",1,Big Bang Theory,36,7
89,Leonard,1," Uh, yes.",1,Big Bang Theory,9,2
90,Penny,1," Oh, that's so nice, I'd love to.",1,Big Bang Theory,33,7
91,Leonard,1, Great.,1,Big Bang Theory,7,1
92,Penny,1," So, what do you guys do for fun around here?",1,Big Bang Theory,45,10
93,Sheldon,1," Well, today we tried masturbating for money.",1,Big Bang Theory,45,7
95,Leonard,1," Okay, well, make yourself at home.",1,Big Bang Theory,35,6
96,Penny,1," Okay, thankyou.",1,Big Bang Theory,16,2
97,Leonard,1, You're very welcome.,1,Big Bang Theory,21,3
98,Penny,1," This looks like some serious stuff, Leonard, did you do this?",1,Big Bang Theory,62,11
99,Sheldon,1, Actually that's my work.,1,Big Bang Theory,25,4
100,Penny,1, Wow.,1,Big Bang Theory,5,1
101,Sheldon,1," Yeah, well, it's just some quantum mechanics, with a little string theory doodling around the edges. That part there, that's just a joke, it's a spoof of the Bourne-Oppenheimer approximation.",1,Big Bang Theory,192,30
102,Penny,1," So you're like, one of those, beautiful mind genius guys.",1,Big Bang Theory,58,10
103,Sheldon,1, Yeah. ,1,Big Bang Theory,7,1
104,Penny,1, This is really impressive.,1,Big Bang Theory,27,4
105,Leonard,1," I have a board. If you like boards, this is my board.",1,Big Bang Theory,54,12
106,Penny,1, Holy smokes.,1,Big Bang Theory,13,2
107,Sheldon,1," If by holy smokes you mean a derivative restatement of the kind of stuff you can find scribbled on the wall of any men's room at MIT, sure.",1,Big Bang Theory,140,28
108,Leonard,1, What?,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
109,Sheldon,1," Oh, come on. Who hasn't seen this differential below â€œhere I sit broken hearted?â€ù",1,Big Bang Theory,86,14
110,Leonard,1, At least I didn't have to invent twenty-six dimensions just to make the math come out.,1,Big Bang Theory,87,16
111,Sheldon,1," I didn't invent them, they're there.",1,Big Bang Theory,37,6
112,Leonard,1, In what universe?,1,Big Bang Theory,18,3
113,Sheldon,1," In all of them, that is the point.",1,Big Bang Theory,35,8
114,Penny,1," Uh, do you guys mind if I start?",1,Big Bang Theory,33,8
115,Sheldon,1," Um, Penny, that's where I sit.",1,Big Bang Theory,31,6
116,Penny,1," So, sit next to me. ",1,Big Bang Theory,21,5
117,Sheldon,1," No, I sit there.",1,Big Bang Theory,17,4
118,Penny,1, What's the difference?,1,Big Bang Theory,23,3
119,Sheldon,1, What's the difference?,1,Big Bang Theory,23,3
120,Leonard,1, Here we go.,1,Big Bang Theory,12,3
121,Sheldon,1," In the winter that seat is close enough to the radiator to remain warm, and yet not so close as to cause perspiration. In the summer it's directly in the path of a cross breeze created by open windows there, and there. It faces the television at an angle that is neither direct, thus discouraging conversation, nor so far wide to create a parallax distortion, I could go on, but I think I've made my point. ",1,Big Bang Theory,408,76
122,Penny,1, Do you want me to move?,1,Big Bang Theory,24,6
123,Sheldon,1, Well.,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
124,Leonard,1, Just sit somewhere else.,1,Big Bang Theory,25,4
125,Sheldon,1, Fine. ,1,Big Bang Theory,7,1
126,Leonard,1," Sheldon, sit!",1,Big Bang Theory,14,2
127,Sheldon,1, Aaah!,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
128,Leonard,1, Well this is nice. We don't have a lot of company over.,1,Big Bang Theory,56,12
129,Sheldon,1, That's not true. Koothrapali and Wolowitz come over all the time. ,1,Big Bang Theory,67,11
130,Leonard,1," Yes I now, but",1,Big Bang Theory,15,4
131,Sheldon,1, Tuesday night we played Klingon boggle until one in the morning.,1,Big Bang Theory,65,11
132,Leonard,1," Yes, I remember.",1,Big Bang Theory,17,3
133,Sheldon,1, I resent you saying we don't have company.,1,Big Bang Theory,43,8
134,Leonard,1, I'm sorry.,1,Big Bang Theory,11,2
135,Sheldon,1, That is an antisocial implication.,1,Big Bang Theory,35,5
136,Leonard,1, I said I'm sorry.,1,Big Bang Theory,18,4
137,Penny,1," So, Klingon boggle?",1,Big Bang Theory,20,3
138,Leonard,1," Yeah, it's like regular boggle but, in Klingon. That's probably enough about us, tell us about you.",1,Big Bang Theory,100,17
139,Penny,1," Um, me, okay, I'm Sagittarius, which probably tells you way more than you need to know.",1,Big Bang Theory,88,16
140,Sheldon,1," Yes, it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural delusion that the Sun's apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined constellations and the time of your birth somehow effects your personality.",1,Big Bang Theory,209,32
141,Penny,1, Participate in the what?,1,Big Bang Theory,25,4
142,Leonard,1," I think what Sheldon's trying to say, is that Sagittarius wouldn't have been our first guess.",1,Big Bang Theory,94,16
143,Penny,1," Oh, yeah, a lot of people think I'm a water sign. Okay, let's see, what else, oh, I'm a vegetarian, oh, except for fish, and the occasional steak, I love steak. ",1,Big Bang Theory,162,31
144,Sheldon,1, That's interesting. Leonard can't process corn.,1,Big Bang Theory,48,6
145,Leonard,1," Wu-uh, do you have some sort of a job?",1,Big Bang Theory,39,9
146,Penny,1," Oh, yeah, I'm a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory.",1,Big Bang Theory,52,9
147,Leonard,1," Oh, okay. I love cheesecake.",1,Big Bang Theory,29,5
148,Sheldon,1, You're lactose intolerant. ,1,Big Bang Theory,28,3
149,Leonard,1," I don't eat it, I just think it's a good idea.",1,Big Bang Theory,47,11
150,Penny,1," Oh, anyways, I'm also writing a screenplay. It's about this sensitive girl who comes to L.A. from Lincoln Nebraska to be an actress, and winds up a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory.",1,Big Bang Theory,184,32
151,Leonard,1, So it's based on your life?,1,Big Bang Theory,28,6
152,Penny,1," No, I'm from Omaha. ",1,Big Bang Theory,21,4
153,Leonard,1," Well, if that was a movie I would go see it.",1,Big Bang Theory,45,11
154,Penny,1," I know, right? Okay, let's see, what else? Um, that's about it. That's the story of Penny.",1,Big Bang Theory,91,17
155,Leonard,1, Well it sounds wonderful.,1,Big Bang Theory,26,4
156,Penny,1, It was. Until I fell in love with a jerk. ,1,Big Bang Theory,43,10
157,Sheldon,1, What's happening.,1,Big Bang Theory,18,2
158,Leonard,1, I don't know.,1,Big Bang Theory,14,3
159,Penny,1," Oh God, you know, four years I lived with him, four years, that's like as long as High School. ",1,Big Bang Theory,96,19
160,Sheldon,1, It took you four years to get through High School?,1,Big Bang Theory,51,10
161,Leonard,1, Don't.,1,Big Bang Theory,7,1
162,Penny,1," I just, I can't believe I trusted him.",1,Big Bang Theory,39,8
163,Leonard,1, Should I say something? I feel like I should say something.,1,Big Bang Theory,60,11
164,Sheldon,1," You? No, you'll only make it worse.",1,Big Bang Theory,36,7
165,Penny,1," You want to know the most pathetic part? Even though I hate his lying, cheating guts, I still love him. Is that crazy?",1,Big Bang Theory,119,23
166,Sheldon,1, Yes. ,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
167,Leonard,1," No, it's not crazy it's, uh, uh, it's a paradox. And paradoxes are part of nature, think about light. Now if you look at Huygens, light is a wave, as confirmed by the double slit experiments, but then, along comes Albert Einstein and discovers that light behaves like particles too. Well, I didn't make it worse.",1,Big Bang Theory,313,56
168,Penny,1," Oh, I'm so sorry, I'm such a mess, and on top of everything else I'm all gross from moving and my stupid shower doesn't even work.",1,Big Bang Theory,131,26
169,Leonard,1, Our shower works.,1,Big Bang Theory,18,3
170,Penny,1, Really? Would it be totally weird if I used it?,1,Big Bang Theory,48,10
171,Sheldon,1, Yes. ,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
172,Leonard,1, No.,1,Big Bang Theory,4,1
173,Sheldon,1, No?,1,Big Bang Theory,4,1
174,Leonard,1, No.,1,Big Bang Theory,4,1
175,Sheldon,1, No.,1,Big Bang Theory,4,1
176,Leonard,1, It's right down the hall.,1,Big Bang Theory,26,5
177,Penny,1, Thanks. You guys are really sweet.,1,Big Bang Theory,35,6
178,Sheldon,1, Well this is an interesting development. ,1,Big Bang Theory,42,6
179,Leonard,1, How so?,1,Big Bang Theory,8,2
180,Sheldon,1, It has been some time since we've had a woman take her clothes off in our apartment.,1,Big Bang Theory,85,17
181,Leonard,1," That's not true, remember at Thanksgiving my grandmother with Alzheimer's had that episode.",1,Big Bang Theory,92,13
182,Sheldon,1, Point taken. It has been some time since we've had a woman take her clothes off after which we didn't want to rip our eyes out. ,1,Big Bang Theory,129,26
183,Leonard,1, The worst part was watching her carve that turkey.,1,Big Bang Theory,51,9
184,Sheldon,1," So, what exactly are you trying to accomplish here?",1,Big Bang Theory,52,9
185,Leonard,1, Excuse me?,1,Big Bang Theory,11,2
186,Sheldon,1, That woman in there's not going to have sex with you.,1,Big Bang Theory,54,11
187,Leonard,1, Well I'm not trying to have sex with her.,1,Big Bang Theory,42,9
188,Sheldon,1," Oh, good. Then you won't be disappointed.",1,Big Bang Theory,42,7
189,Leonard,1," What makes you think she wouldn't have sex with me, I'm a male and she's a female?",1,Big Bang Theory,83,17
190,Sheldon,1," Yes, but not of the same species.",1,Big Bang Theory,34,7
191,Leonard,1," I'm not going to engage in hypotheticals here, I'm just trying to be a good neighbour.",1,Big Bang Theory,87,16
192,Sheldon,1," Oh, of course.",1,Big Bang Theory,15,3
193,Leonard,1, That's not to say that if a carnal relationship were to develop that I wouldn't participate. However briefly.,1,Big Bang Theory,110,18
194,Sheldon,1, Do you think this possibility will be helped or hindered when she discovers your Luke Skywalker no-more-tears shampoo?,1,Big Bang Theory,119,18
195,Leonard,1, It's Darth Vader shampoo.  Luke Skywalker's the conditioner.,1,Big Bang Theory,61,8
196,Howard,1, Wait till you see this.,1,Big Bang Theory,24,5
197,Raj,1, It's fantastic. Unbelievable.,1,Big Bang Theory,30,3
198,Leonard,1, See what?,1,Big Bang Theory,10,2
199,Howard,1, It's a Stephen Hawking lecture from MIT in 1974.,1,Big Bang Theory,49,9
200,Leonard,1, This is not a good time.,1,Big Bang Theory,25,6
201,Leonard,1," That's great, you guys have to go.",1,Big Bang Theory,35,7
202,Raj,1, Why?,1,Big Bang Theory,5,1
203,Leonard,1, It's just not a good time.,1,Big Bang Theory,27,6
204,Sheldon,1, Leonard has a lady over.,1,Big Bang Theory,25,5
205,Howard,1," Yeah, right, your grandmother back in town?",1,Big Bang Theory,44,7
206,Leonard,1," No. And she's not a lady, she's just a new neighbour.",1,Big Bang Theory,54,11
207,Howard,1," Hang on, there really is a lady here?",1,Big Bang Theory,38,8
208,Leonard,1, Uh-huh.,1,Big Bang Theory,8,1
209,Howard,1, And you want us out because you're anticipating coitus?,1,Big Bang Theory,56,9
210,Leonard,1, I'm not anticipating coitus.,1,Big Bang Theory,29,4
211,Howard,1, So she's available for coitus?,1,Big Bang Theory,31,5
213,Sheldon,1, Technically that would be coitus interruptus.,1,Big Bang Theory,46,6
214,Penny,1," Hey, is there a trick to getting it to switch from tub to shower. Oh. Hi, sorry. Hello!",1,Big Bang Theory,88,18
215,Howard,1," Enchante Madamoiselle. Howard Wolowitz, Cal-Tech department of Applied Physics. You may be familiar with some of my work, it's currently orbiting Jupiter's largest moon taking high-resolution digital photographs.",1,Big Bang Theory,213,28
216,Penny,1, Penny. I work at the Cheesecake Factory.,1,Big Bang Theory,41,7
217,Leonard,1," Come on, I'll show you the trick with the shower.",1,Big Bang Theory,50,10
218,Howard,1, Bon douche.,1,Big Bang Theory,12,2
219,Penny,1, I'm sorry?,1,Big Bang Theory,11,2
220,Howard,1, It's French for good shower. It's a sentiment I can express in six languages.,1,Big Bang Theory,78,14
221,Leonard,1," Save it for your blog, Howard.",1,Big Bang Theory,31,6
222,Howard,1, See-ka-tong-guay-jow.,1,Big Bang Theory,22,1
224,Leonard,1," Uh, there it goes, it sticks, I'm sorry.",1,Big Bang Theory,41,8
225,Penny,1, Okay. Thanks. ,1,Big Bang Theory,15,2
226,Leonard,1," You're welcome, oh, you're going to step right, okay, I'll.",1,Big Bang Theory,60,10
227,Penny,1," Hey, Leonard?",1,Big Bang Theory,14,2
228,Leonard,1, The hair products are Sheldon's.,1,Big Bang Theory,33,5
229,Penny,1," Um, okay. Can I ask you a favour.",1,Big Bang Theory,34,8
230,Leonard,1," A favour? Sure, you can ask me a favour, I would do you a favour for you.",1,Big Bang Theory,74,17
231,Penny,1, It's okay if you say no.,1,Big Bang Theory,25,6
232,Leonard,1," Oh, I'll probably say yes.",1,Big Bang Theory,27,5
233,Penny,1, It's just not the kind of thing you ask a guy you've just met.,1,Big Bang Theory,63,14
234,Leonard,1, Wow.,1,Big Bang Theory,5,1
236,Sheldon,1, I really think we should examine the chain of causality here.,1,Big Bang Theory,62,11
237,Leonard,1, Must we?,1,Big Bang Theory,9,2
238,Sheldon,1," Event A. A beautiful woman stands naked in our shower. Event B. We drive half way across town to retrieve a television set from the aforementioned woman's ex-boyfriend. Query, on what plane of existence is there even a semi-rational link between these events?",1,Big Bang Theory,260,43
239,Leonard,1," She asked me to do her a favour, Sheldon.",1,Big Bang Theory,42,9
240,Sheldon,1," Ah, yes, well that may be the proximal cause of our journey, but we both know it only exists in contradistinction to the higher level distal cause.",1,Big Bang Theory,148,27
241,Leonard,1, Which is?,1,Big Bang Theory,10,2
242,Sheldon,1, You think with your penis.,1,Big Bang Theory,27,5
243,Leonard,1, That's a biological impossibility and you didn't have to come.,1,Big Bang Theory,63,10
244,Sheldon,1," Oh, right, yes, I could have stayed behind and watched Wolowitz try to hit on Penny in Russian, Arabic and Farsi. Why can't she get her own TV.",1,Big Bang Theory,144,28
245,Leonard,1," Come on, you know how it is with break-ups.",1,Big Bang Theory,44,9
246,Sheldon,1, No I don't. And neither do you.,1,Big Bang Theory,32,7
247,Leonard,1," Wuh, I, I broke up with Joyce Kim.",1,Big Bang Theory,35,8
248,Sheldon,1," You did not break up with Joyce Kim, she defected to North Korea.",1,Big Bang Theory,66,13
249,Leonard,1, To mend her broken heart. This situation is much less complicated. There's some kind of dispute between Penny and her ex-boyfriend as to who gets custody of the TV. She just wanted to avoid having a scene with him.,1,Big Bang Theory,215,39
250,Sheldon,1, So we get to have a scene with him?,1,Big Bang Theory,36,9
251,Leonard,1," No, Sheldon, there's not going to be a scene. There's two of us and one of him.",1,Big Bang Theory,80,17
252,Sheldon,1," Leonard, the two of us can't even carry a TV. ",1,Big Bang Theory,47,10
254,Penny,1," So, you guys work with Leonard and Sheldon at the University?",1,Big Bang Theory,62,11
255,Penny,1," Uh, I'm sorry, do you speak English?",1,Big Bang Theory,37,7
256,Howard,1," Oh, he speaks English, he just can't speak to women.",1,Big Bang Theory,53,10
257,Penny,1," Really, why?",1,Big Bang Theory,13,2
258,Howard,1, He's kind of a nerd. Juice box?,1,Big Bang Theory,32,7
260,Leonard,1, I'll do the talking.,1,Big Bang Theory,21,4
262,Leonard,1," Hi, I'm Leonard, this is Sheldon.",1,Big Bang Theory,34,6
263,Sheldon,1, Hello.,1,Big Bang Theory,7,1
264,Leonard,1," What did I just. Uh, we're here to pick up Penny's TV.",1,Big Bang Theory,55,12
266,Sheldon,1," Okay, thanks for your time.",1,Big Bang Theory,28,5
267,Leonard,1, We're not going to give up just like that.,1,Big Bang Theory,43,9
268,Sheldon,1," Leonard, the TV is in the building, we've been denied access to the building, ergo we are done.",1,Big Bang Theory,96,18
269,Leonard,1," Excuse me, if I were to give up at the first little hitch I never would have been able to identify the fingerprints of string theory in the aftermath of the big bang.",1,Big Bang Theory,167,33
270,Sheldon,1, My apologies. What's your plan.,1,Big Bang Theory,32,5
271,Sheldon,1, It's just a privilege to watch your mind at work.,1,Big Bang Theory,50,10
272,Leonard,1," Come on, we have a combined IQ of 360, we should be able to figure out how to get into a stupid building.",1,Big Bang Theory,106,23
273,Sheldon,1, What do you think their combined IQ is?,1,Big Bang Theory,40,8
274,Leonard,1, Just grab the door.,1,Big Bang Theory,20,4
276,Leonard,1, This is it.  I'll do the talking.,1,Big Bang Theory,34,7
277,Sheldon,1," Good thinking, I'll just be the muscle.",1,Big Bang Theory,40,7
279,Leonard,1," I'm Leonard, this is Sheldon.",1,Big Bang Theory,30,5
280,Sheldon,1, From the intercom.,1,Big Bang Theory,19,3
282,Leonard,1, Oh. We're scientists.,1,Big Bang Theory,22,3
283,Sheldon,1, Tell him about our IQ.,1,Big Bang Theory,23,5
285,Sheldon,1, Leonard.,1,Big Bang Theory,9,1
286,Leonard,1, What?,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
287,Sheldon,1, My mom bought me those pants.,1,Big Bang Theory,30,6
288,Leonard,1, I'm sorry.,1,Big Bang Theory,11,2
289,Sheldon,1, You're going to have to call her.,1,Big Bang Theory,34,7
291,Leonard,1," Sheldon, I'm so sorry I dragged you through this.",1,Big Bang Theory,50,9
292,Sheldon,1," It's okay. It wasn't my first pantsing, and it won't be my last.",1,Big Bang Theory,65,13
293,Leonard,1," And you were right about my motives, I was hoping to establish a relationship with Penny that might have some day led to sex.",1,Big Bang Theory,126,24
294,Sheldon,1, Well you got me out of my pants.,1,Big Bang Theory,33,8
295,Leonard,1," Anyway, I've learned my lesson. She's out of my league, I'm done with her, I've got my work, one day I'll win the Nobel Prize and then I'll die alone.",1,Big Bang Theory,151,30
296,Sheldon,1," Don't think like that, you're not going to die alone.",1,Big Bang Theory,54,10
297,Leonard,1," Thank you Sheldon, you're a good friend.",1,Big Bang Theory,41,7
298,Sheldon,1, And you're certainly not going to win a Nobel Prize.,1,Big Bang Theory,53,10
300,Howard,1," This is one of my favourite places to kick back after a quest, they have a great house ale.",1,Big Bang Theory,92,19
301,Penny,1," Wow, cool tiger.",1,Big Bang Theory,17,3
302,Howard,1," Yeah, I've had him since level ten. His name is Buttons. Anyway, if you had your own game character we could hang out, maybe go on a quest.",1,Big Bang Theory,140,28
303,Penny,1," Uh, sounds interesting.",1,Big Bang Theory,24,3
304,Howard,1, So you'll think about it?,1,Big Bang Theory,26,5
305,Penny,1," Oh, I don't think I'll be able to stop thinking about it.",1,Big Bang Theory,58,12
306,Raj,1, Smooth.,1,Big Bang Theory,8,1
307,Leonard,1, We're home.,1,Big Bang Theory,12,2
308,Penny,1," Oh, my God, what happened?",1,Big Bang Theory,27,5
309,Leonard,1," Well, your ex-boyfriend sends his regards and I think the rest is fairly self-explanatory.",1,Big Bang Theory,91,14
310,Penny,1," I'm so sorry, I really thought if you guys went instead of me he wouldn't be such an ass.",1,Big Bang Theory,90,19
311,Leonard,1," No, it was a valid hypothesis.",1,Big Bang Theory,31,6
312,Sheldon,1, That was a valid hypothesis? What is happening to you?,1,Big Bang Theory,55,10
313,Penny,1," Really, thank you so much for going and trying you're, uh, you're so terrific. Why don't you put some clothes on, I'll get my purse and dinner is on me, okay?",1,Big Bang Theory,159,31
314,Leonard,1, Really? Great.,1,Big Bang Theory,15,2
315,Sheldon,1," Thank you. You're not done with her, are you?",1,Big Bang Theory,46,9
316,Leonard,1, Our babies will be smart and beautiful.,1,Big Bang Theory,40,7
317,Sheldon,1, Not to mention imaginary.,1,Big Bang Theory,26,4
319,Leonard,1, Is Thai food okay with you Penny?,1,Big Bang Theory,34,7
320,Penny,1, Sure.,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
321,Sheldon,1," We can't have Thai food, we had Indian for lunch.",1,Big Bang Theory,50,10
322,Penny,1, So?,1,Big Bang Theory,4,1
323,Sheldon,1, They're both curry based cuisines.,1,Big Bang Theory,35,5
324,Penny,1, So?,1,Big Bang Theory,4,1
325,Sheldon,1, They would be gastronomically redundant. I can see we're going to have to spell out everything for this girl.,1,Big Bang Theory,110,19
326,Penny,1, Any ideas Raj? ,1,Big Bang Theory,16,3
327,Howard,1, Turn left on Lake Street and head up to Colorado. I know a wonderful little sushi bar that has karaoke.,1,Big Bang Theory,104,20
328,Penny,1, That sounds like fun.,1,Big Bang Theory,22,4
329,Howard,1," Baby, baby don't get hooked on me. Uh, baby, baby don't get hooked on me.",1,Big Bang Theory,74,15
331,Leonard,2," There you go, Pad Thai, no peanuts.",1,Big Bang Theory,36,7
332,Howard,2, But does it have peanut oil?,1,Big Bang Theory,29,6
333,Leonard,2," Uh, I'm not sure, everyone keep an eye on Howard in case he starts to swell up.",1,Big Bang Theory,80,17
334,Sheldon,2," Since it's not bee season, you can have my epinephrine.",1,Big Bang Theory,56,10
335,Raj,2, Are there any chopsticks?,1,Big Bang Theory,26,4
336,Sheldon,2," You don't need chopsticks, this is Thai food.",1,Big Bang Theory,46,8
337,Leonard,2, Here we go.,1,Big Bang Theory,12,3
338,Sheldon,2," Thailand has had the fork since the latter half of the nineteenth century. Interestingly they don't actually put the fork in their mouth, they use it to put the food on a spoon which then goes into their mouth.",1,Big Bang Theory,211,39
339,Leonard,2," Ask him for a napkin, I dare you.  I'll get it.",1,Big Bang Theory,48,11
340,Howard,2, Do I look puffy? I feel puffy.,1,Big Bang Theory,31,7
341,Penny,2, Hey Leonard.,1,Big Bang Theory,13,2
342,Leonard,2," Oh, hi Penny.",1,Big Bang Theory,14,3
343,Penny,2, Am I interrupting.,1,Big Bang Theory,19,3
344,Leonard,2, No.,1,Big Bang Theory,4,1
345,Sheldon,2," You're not swelling, Howard.",1,Big Bang Theory,29,4
346,Howard,2," No, no, look at my fingers, they're like Vienna sausages.",1,Big Bang Theory,58,10
347,Penny,2, Sounds like you have company.,1,Big Bang Theory,30,5
348,Leonard,2," They're not going anywhere.  So, you're coming home from work. That's great. How was work.",1,Big Bang Theory,91,15
349,Penny,2," Well, you know, it's the Cheesecake Factory. People order cheesecake, and I bring it to them.",1,Big Bang Theory,94,16
350,Leonard,2," So, you sort of act as a carbohydrate delivery system.",1,Big Bang Theory,55,10
351,Penny,2," Yeah, call it whatever you want, I get minimum wage. Yeah, anyways, I was wondering if you could help me out with something, I was.",1,Big Bang Theory,132,25
352,Leonard,2, Yes.,1,Big Bang Theory,5,1
353,Penny,2," Oh. Okay, great, I'm having some furniture delivered tomorrow, and I may not be here, so.  Oh! Helhello!",1,Big Bang Theory,105,18
354,Howard,2, .,1,Big Bang Theory,2,1
355,Penny,2, I'm sorry?,1,Big Bang Theory,11,2
356,Howard,2, Haven't you ever been told how beautiful you are in flawless Russian?,1,Big Bang Theory,70,12
357,Penny,2," No, I haven't.",1,Big Bang Theory,15,3
358,Howard,2, Get used to it.,1,Big Bang Theory,16,4
359,Penny,2," Yeah, I probably won't, but Hey Sheldon.",1,Big Bang Theory,41,7
360,Sheldon,2, Hi.,1,Big Bang Theory,4,1
361,Penny,2," Hey Raj!  Still not talking to me, huh?",1,Big Bang Theory,40,8
362,Sheldon,2," Don't take it personally, it's his pathology, he can't talk to women.",1,Big Bang Theory,70,12
363,Howard,2," He can't talk to attractive women, or in your case a cheesecakeâ€“scented Goddess!",1,Big Bang Theory,83,13
364,Leonard,2," So, there's gonna be some furniture delivered?",1,Big Bang Theory,47,7
365,Penny,2," Yeah, yeah, if it gets here and I'm not here tomorrow could you just sign for it and have them put it in my apartment.",1,Big Bang Theory,119,25
366,Leonard,2," Yeah, no problem.",1,Big Bang Theory,18,3
367,Penny,2," Great, here's my spare key. Thank you.",1,Big Bang Theory,39,7
368,Leonard,2," Penny, wait.",1,Big Bang Theory,13,2
369,Penny,2, Yeah?,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
370,Leonard,2," Um, if you don't have any other plans, do you want to join us for Thai food and a Superman movie marathon?",1,Big Bang Theory,107,22
371,Penny,2," A marathon? Wow, how many Superman movies are there?",1,Big Bang Theory,53,9
372,Sheldon,2," You're kidding, right?",1,Big Bang Theory,23,3
373,Penny,2," Yeah, I do like the one where Lois Lane falls from the helicopter and Superman swooshes down and catches her, which one was that? ",1,Big Bang Theory,131,24
375,Sheldon,2, You realise that scene was rife with scientific inaccuracy.,1,Big Bang Theory,60,9
376,Penny,2," Yes, I know, men can't fly.",1,Big Bang Theory,28,6
377,Sheldon,2," Oh no, let's assume that they can. Lois Lane is falling, accelerating at an initial rate of 32 feet per second per second. Superman swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel. Miss Lane, who is now travelling at approximately 120 miles per hour, hits them, and is immediately sliced into three equal pieces. ",1,Big Bang Theory,324,58
378,Leonard,2," Unless, Superman matches her speed and decelerates. ",1,Big Bang Theory,53,7
379,Sheldon,2," In what space, sir, in what space? She's two feet above the ground. Frankly, if he really loved her, he'd let her hit the pavement. It would be a more merciful death.",1,Big Bang Theory,167,32
380,Leonard,2," Excuse me, your entire argument is predicated on the assumption that Superman's flight is a feat of strength.",1,Big Bang Theory,110,18
381,Sheldon,2," Are you listening to yourself, it is well established that Superman's flight is a feat of strength, it is an extension of his ability to leap tall buildings, an ability he derives from Earth's yellow Sun.",1,Big Bang Theory,205,36
382,Howard,2," Yeah, and you don't have a problem with that, how does he fly at night.",1,Big Bang Theory,72,15
383,Sheldon,2," Uh, a combination of the moon's solar reflection and the energy storage capacity of Kryptonian skin cells.",1,Big Bang Theory,107,17
384,Penny,2, I'm just going to go wash up.,1,Big Bang Theory,30,7
385,Leonard,2," I have 26 hundred comic books in there, I challenge you to find a single reference to Kryptonian skin cells.",1,Big Bang Theory,109,20
386,Sheldon,2, Challenge accepted.  We're locked out.,1,Big Bang Theory,39,5
387,Raj,2," Also, the pretty girl left.",1,Big Bang Theory,28,5
389,Leonard,2," Okay, her apartment's on the fourth floor but the elevator's broken so you're going to have to  oh, you're just going to be done, okay, cool, thanks. I guess we'll just bring it up ourselves.",1,Big Bang Theory,192,35
390,Sheldon,2, I hardly think so. ,1,Big Bang Theory,20,4
391,Leonard,2, Why not?,1,Big Bang Theory,9,2
392,Sheldon,2," Well, we don't have a dolly, or lifting belts, or any measurable upper body strength.",1,Big Bang Theory,86,15
393,Leonard,2," We don't need strength, we're physicists. We are the intellectual descendents of Archimedes. Give me a fulcrum and a lever and I can move the Earth, it's just a matter  I don't have this I don't have this I don't have this.",1,Big Bang Theory,224,42
394,Sheldon,2, Archimedes would be so proud.,1,Big Bang Theory,30,5
395,Leonard,2, Do you have any ideas?,1,Big Bang Theory,23,5
396,Sheldon,2," Yes, but they all involve a green lantern and a power ring.",1,Big Bang Theory,60,12
397,Leonard,2," Easy, easy  Okay! Now we've got an inclined plane. The force required to lift is reduced by the sine of the angle of the stairs, call it thirty degrees, so about half. ",1,Big Bang Theory,169,32
398,Sheldon,2, Exactly half.,1,Big Bang Theory,14,2
399,Leonard,2," Exactly half. Let's push. Okay, see, it's moving, this is easy, all in the math. ",1,Big Bang Theory,82,15
400,Sheldon,2, What's your formula for the corner.,1,Big Bang Theory,36,6
401,Leonard,2," What? Oh, okay, uh, okay, yeah, no problem, just come up here and help me pull and turn.",1,Big Bang Theory,89,18
402,Sheldon,2," Ah, gravity, thou art a heartless bitch.",1,Big Bang Theory,41,7
403,Sheldon,2, You do understand that our efforts here will in no way increase the odds of you having sexual congress with this woman?,1,Big Bang Theory,120,22
404,Leonard,2, Men do things for women without expecting sex.,1,Big Bang Theory,47,8
405,Sheldon,2," Yeah, those are men who just had sex.",1,Big Bang Theory,38,8
406,Leonard,2," I'm doing this to be a good neighbour. In any case, there's no way it could lower the odds.",1,Big Bang Theory,92,19
407,Leonard,2," Almost there, almost there, almost there. ",1,Big Bang Theory,43,6
408,Sheldon,2," No we're not, no we're not, no we're not.",1,Big Bang Theory,42,9
410,Sheldon,2," Watch your fingers. Watch your fingers. Oh God, my fingers!",1,Big Bang Theory,60,10
411,Leonard,2, You okay?,1,Big Bang Theory,10,2
412,Sheldon,2," No, it hurt  Great Caesar's Ghost, look at this place?",1,Big Bang Theory,55,10
413,Leonard,2, So Penny's a little messy.,1,Big Bang Theory,27,5
414,Sheldon,2," A little messy? The Mandelbrot set of complex numbers is a little messy, this is chaos. Excuse me, explain to me an organisational system where a tray of flatware on a couch is valid. I'm just inferring that this is a couch, because the evidence suggests the coffee table's having a tiny garage sale. ",1,Big Bang Theory,302,54
415,Leonard,2," Did it ever occur to you that not everyone has the compulsive need to sort, organise and label the entire world around them?",1,Big Bang Theory,125,23
416,Sheldon,2, No.,1,Big Bang Theory,4,1
417,Leonard,2," Well they don't. Hard as it may be for you to believe, most people don't sort their breakfast cereal numerically by fibre content.",1,Big Bang Theory,131,23
418,Sheldon,2," Excuse me, but I think we've both found that helpful at times.",1,Big Bang Theory,63,12
419,Leonard,2," Come on, we should go.",1,Big Bang Theory,23,5
420,Sheldon,2, Hang on.,1,Big Bang Theory,9,2
421,Leonard,2, What are you doing?,1,Big Bang Theory,20,4
422,Sheldon,2, Straightening up.,1,Big Bang Theory,18,2
423,Leonard,2," Sheldon, this is not your home.",1,Big Bang Theory,32,6
424,Sheldon,2," This is not anyone's home, this is a swirling vortex of entropy.",1,Big Bang Theory,65,12
425,Leonard,2," When the transvestite lived here, you didn't care how he kept the place.",1,Big Bang Theory,73,13
426,Sheldon,2," Because it was immaculate, I mean, you open that man's closet, it was left to right, evening gowns, cocktail dresses, then his police uniforms.",1,Big Bang Theory,144,24
427,Leonard,2, What were you doing in his closet?,1,Big Bang Theory,35,7
428,Sheldon,2, I helped run some cable for a webcam.,1,Big Bang Theory,38,8
429,Penny,2, Hey guys.,1,Big Bang Theory,10,2
430,Leonard,2," Oh, hey Penny, this just arrived, we just brought this up, just now.",1,Big Bang Theory,69,13
431,Penny,2, Great. Was it hard getting it up the stairs?,1,Big Bang Theory,45,9
432,Sheldon,2, ,1,Big Bang Theory,1,0
433,Leonard,2, No.,1,Big Bang Theory,4,1
434,Sheldon,2, No?,1,Big Bang Theory,4,1
435,Leonard,2, No.,1,Big Bang Theory,4,1
436,Sheldon,2, No.,1,Big Bang Theory,4,1
437,Leonard,2," Well, we'll get out of your hair.",1,Big Bang Theory,34,7
438,Penny,2," Oh, great, thank you again .",1,Big Bang Theory,29,6
439,Sheldon,2," Penny, I just want you to know that, you don't have to live like this. I'm here for you.",1,Big Bang Theory,89,19
440,Penny,2, What's he talking about?,1,Big Bang Theory,25,4
441,Leonard,2, It's a joke.,1,Big Bang Theory,13,3
442,Penny,2, I don't get it.,1,Big Bang Theory,16,4
443,Leonard,2," Yeah, he didn't tell it right.",1,Big Bang Theory,31,6
444,Leonard,2, Sheldon?,1,Big Bang Theory,9,1
446,Leonard,2, Sheldon? Hello? ,1,Big Bang Theory,17,2
448,Leonard,2, Sheldon!,1,Big Bang Theory,9,1
449,Sheldon,2, Sssshhhh! Penny's sleeping.,1,Big Bang Theory,28,3
450,Leonard,2," Are you insane, you can't just break into a woman's apartment in the middle of the night and clean.",1,Big Bang Theory,100,19
451,Sheldon,2," I had no choice. I couldn't sleep knowing that just outside my bedroom was our living room, and just outside our living room was that hallway, and immediately adjacent to that hallway was this.",1,Big Bang Theory,194,34
452,Leonard,2," Do you realise that if Penny wakes up, there is no reasonable explanation as to why we're here?",1,Big Bang Theory,96,18
453,Sheldon,2, I just gave you a reasonable explanation.,1,Big Bang Theory,42,7
454,Leonard,2," No, no. You gave me an explanation, it's reasonableness will be determined by a jury of your peers.",1,Big Bang Theory,100,18
455,Sheldon,2, Don't be ridiculous. I have no peers.,1,Big Bang Theory,38,7
456,Leonard,2," Sheldon, we have to get out of here.",1,Big Bang Theory,37,8
457,Sheldon,2, You might want to speak in a lower register.,1,Big Bang Theory,45,9
458,Leonard,2, What?,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
459,Sheldon,2," Evolution has made women sensitive to high pitched noises while they sleep, so that they'll be roused by a crying baby. If you want to avoid waking her, speak in a lower register.",1,Big Bang Theory,180,33
460,Leonard,2, That's ridiculous. ,1,Big Bang Theory,20,2
461,Sheldon,2," No,  that's ridiculous.",1,Big Bang Theory,24,3
462,Leonard,2," Fine. I accept your premise, now please let's go.",1,Big Bang Theory,50,9
463,Sheldon,2, I am not leaving until I'm done.,1,Big Bang Theory,33,7
464,Leonard,2, O-o-o-oh! .,1,Big Bang Theory,12,2
465,Sheldon,2," If you have time to lean, you have time to clean.",1,Big Bang Theory,50,11
466,Leonard,2," Oh, what the hell.",1,Big Bang Theory,19,4
468,Sheldon,2, Morning.,1,Big Bang Theory,9,1
469,Leonard,2, Morning. ,1,Big Bang Theory,10,1
470,Sheldon,2," I have to say, I slept splendidly. Granted, not long, but just deeply and well.",1,Big Bang Theory,80,15
471,Leonard,2, I'm not surprised. A well known folk cure for insomnia is to break into your neighbour's apartment and clean.,1,Big Bang Theory,110,19
472,Sheldon,2, Sarcasm?,1,Big Bang Theory,9,1
473,Leonard,2, You think?,1,Big Bang Theory,11,2
474,Sheldon,2," Granted, my methods may have been somewhat unorthodox, but I think the end result will be a measurable enhancement of Penny's quality of life.",1,Big Bang Theory,143,24
475,Leonard,2," You know what, you've convinced me, maybe tonight we should sneak in and shampoo her carpet.",1,Big Bang Theory,93,16
476,Sheldon,2, You don't think that crosses a line?,1,Big Bang Theory,37,7
477,Leonard,2," Yes! For God's sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign every time I open my mouth.",1,Big Bang Theory,94,20
478,Sheldon,2, You have a sarcasm sign?,1,Big Bang Theory,25,5
479,Leonard,2," No, I do not have a sarcasm sign.",1,Big Bang Theory,34,8
480,Sheldon,2," Do you want some cereal. I'm feeling so good today I'm going to choose from the low fibre end of the shelf. Hello, Honey Puffs.",1,Big Bang Theory,128,25
481,Penny,2, Son of a Bitch!,1,Big Bang Theory,16,4
482,Leonard,2, Penny's up.,1,Big Bang Theory,12,2
483,Penny,2," You sick, geeky bastards!",1,Big Bang Theory,26,4
484,Leonard,2, How did she know it was us?,1,Big Bang Theory,28,7
485,Sheldon,2, I may have left a suggested organisational schematic for her bedroom closet.,1,Big Bang Theory,77,12
486,Penny,2, Leonard!,1,Big Bang Theory,9,1
487,Leonard,2," God, this is going to be bad.",1,Big Bang Theory,30,7
488,Sheldon,2," Goodbye, Honey Puffs, hello Big Bran.",1,Big Bang Theory,38,6
489,Penny,2, You came into my apartment last night when I was sleeping?,1,Big Bang Theory,59,11
490,Leonard,2," Yes, but, only to clean.",1,Big Bang Theory,25,5
491,Sheldon,2," Really more to organise, you're not actually dirty, per se.",1,Big Bang Theory,60,10
492,Penny,2, Give me back my key.,1,Big Bang Theory,21,5
493,Leonard,2," I'm very, very sorry.",1,Big Bang Theory,22,4
494,Penny,2, Do you understand how creepy this is.,1,Big Bang Theory,38,7
495,Leonard,2," Oh, yes, we discussed it at length last night.",1,Big Bang Theory,47,9
496,Penny,2," In my apartment, while I was sleeping.",1,Big Bang Theory,39,7
497,Sheldon,2," And snoring. And that's probably just a sinus infection, but it could be sleep apnoea, you might want to see an otolaryngologist. It's a throat doctor.",1,Big Bang Theory,152,26
498,Penny,2, And what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses?,1,Big Bang Theory,50,9
499,Sheldon,2," Depending on the depth, that's either a proctologist or a general surgeon.  Oh!",1,Big Bang Theory,80,13
500,Penny,2, God!,1,Big Bang Theory,5,1
501,Leonard,2," Okay, look, no Penny, I think what you're feeling is perfectly valid, and maybe a little bit later today when you're feeling a little bit less, for lack of a better word, violated, maybe we could talk about this some more.",1,Big Bang Theory,223,41
502,Penny,2, Stay away from me.,1,Big Bang Theory,19,4
503,Leonard,2," Sure, that's another way to go.",1,Big Bang Theory,32,6
504,Sheldon,2," Penny, Penny, just to clarify because there will be a discussion when you leave, is your objection solely to our presence in the apartment while you were sleeping, or do you also object to the imposition of a new organisational paradigm.  Well that was a little non-responsive.",1,Big Bang Theory,278,47
505,Leonard,2, You are going to march yourself over there right now and apologise.  What's funny?,1,Big Bang Theory,83,14
506,Sheldon,2, That wasn't sarcasm?,1,Big Bang Theory,21,3
507,Leonard,2, No.,1,Big Bang Theory,4,1
508,Sheldon,2," Wooh, boy, you are all over the place this morning.  I have a masters and two PhD's, I should not have to do this.",1,Big Bang Theory,115,24
509,Penny,2, What?,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
510,Sheldon,2," I am truly sorry for what happened last night, I take full responsibility. And I hope that it won't colour your opinion of Leonard, who is not only a wonderful guy, but also, I hear, a gentle and thorough lover.  I did what I could.",1,Big Bang Theory,233,45
512,Penny,2," Hey Raj.  Hey, listen, I don't know if you heard about what happened last night with Leonard and Sheldon, but I'm really upset about it, I mean they just, they let themselves into my place, and then they cleaned it, I mean can you even believe that? How weird is that?",1,Big Bang Theory,269,51
513,Raj,2," Ooh, she's standing very close to me. Oh my, she does smell good. What is that, vanilla?",1,Big Bang Theory,89,17
514,Penny,2," You know, where I come from, someone comes into your house at night, you shoot, okay? And you don't shoot to wound. I mean, alright, my sister shot her husband, but it was an accident, they were drunk. What was I saying?",1,Big Bang Theory,221,42
515,Raj,2," She's so chatty. Maybe my parents are right. Maybe I'd be better off with an Indian girl. We'd have the same cultural background, and my wife would sing to my children the same lullabies my mother sang to me. ",1,Big Bang Theory,210,39
516,Penny,2," It's obvious that they meant well, but I'm just, I'm having a really rough time, like I said, I broke up with my boyfriend, and it's just freaking me out.",1,Big Bang Theory,155,30
517,Penny,2," I mean, just because most of the men I've known in my life happen to be jerks, doesn't mean I should just assume Leonard and Sheldon are. Right?",1,Big Bang Theory,145,28
518,Raj,2, She asked me a question. I should probably nod. ,1,Big Bang Theory,49,9
519,Penny,2, That's exactly what I thought. Thank you for listening. You're a doll. ,1,Big Bang Theory,72,12
520,Raj,2, Oh-oh. Turn your pelvis. ,1,Big Bang Theory,26,4
522,Howard,2," Grab a napkin, homie. You just got served. ",1,Big Bang Theory,44,8
523,Leonard,2, It's fine. You win.,1,Big Bang Theory,20,4
524,Howard,2, What's his problem?,1,Big Bang Theory,20,3
525,Sheldon,2, His imaginary girlfriend broke up with him.,1,Big Bang Theory,44,7
526,Howard,2, Been there.,1,Big Bang Theory,12,2
527,Raj,2," Hello. Sorry I'm late. But I was in the hallway, chatting up Penny.",1,Big Bang Theory,68,13
528,Howard,2," Really? You? Rajesh Koothrapali, spoke to Penny?",1,Big Bang Theory,49,7
529,Raj,2," Actually, I was less the chatter than the chattee.",1,Big Bang Theory,51,9
530,Leonard,2, What did she say? Is she still mad at me?,1,Big Bang Theory,42,10
531,Raj,2," Well, she was upset at first, but, probably because her sister shot somebody. Then there was something about you and then she hugged me.",1,Big Bang Theory,137,24
532,Howard,2, She hugged you? How did she hug you?  Is that her perfume I smell?,1,Big Bang Theory,67,14
533,Raj,2," intoxicating, isn't it?",1,Big Bang Theory,24,3
535,Penny,2, Hi.,1,Big Bang Theory,4,1
536,Leonard,2, Oh.,1,Big Bang Theory,4,1
537,Penny,2, What's going on?,1,Big Bang Theory,17,3
538,Leonard,2," Um, here's the thing.  Penny. Just as Oppenheimer came to regret his contributions to the first atomic bomb, so too I regret my participation in what was, at the very least, an error in judgement. The hallmark of the great human experiment is the willingness to recognise one's mistakes. Some mistakes, such as Madame Curie's discovery of Radium turned out to have great scientific potential even though she would later die a slow, painful death from radiation poisoning. Another example, from the field of ebola research.",1,Big Bang Theory,523,86
539,Penny,2, Leonard.,1,Big Bang Theory,9,1
540,Leonard,2, Yeah.,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
541,Penny,2, We're okay. ,1,Big Bang Theory,13,2
543,Leonard,2, Six two inch dowels.,1,Big Bang Theory,21,4
544,Sheldon,2, Check.,1,Big Bang Theory,7,1
545,Leonard,2," One package, Phillips head screws.",1,Big Bang Theory,35,5
546,Sheldon,2, Check.,1,Big Bang Theory,7,1
547,Penny,2," Guys, seriously, I grew up on a farm, okay, I rebuilt a tractor engine when I was like twelve, I think I can put together a cheap Swedish media centre. ",1,Big Bang Theory,153,30
548,Leonard,2," No, please, we insist, it's the least we can do considering. ",1,Big Bang Theory,62,11
549,Sheldon,2, Considering what? How great this place looks?,1,Big Bang Theory,46,7
550,Howard,2," Oh boy, I was afraid of this.",1,Big Bang Theory,30,7
551,Leonard,2, What?,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
552,Howard,2, These instructions are a pictographic representation of the least imaginative way to assemble these components. This right here is why Sweden has no space program.,1,Big Bang Theory,164,25
553,Penny,2," Well, uh, it looked pretty good in the store.",1,Big Bang Theory,46,9
554,Leonard,2," It is an inefficient design, for example Penny has a flat screen TV, which means all the space behind it is wasted.",1,Big Bang Theory,116,22
555,Sheldon,2, We could put her stereo back there.,1,Big Bang Theory,36,7
556,Leonard,2, And control it how?,1,Big Bang Theory,20,4
557,Sheldon,2," Run an infra-red repeater, photocell here, emitter here, easy peasy. ",1,Big Bang Theory,70,10
558,Howard,2," Good point, how you gonna cool it?",1,Big Bang Theory,35,7
559,Penny,2," Hey guys, I got this. ",1,Big Bang Theory,23,5
560,Sheldon,2," Hang on Penny. How about fans, here and here?",1,Big Bang Theory,46,9
561,Leonard,2," Also inefficient, and might be loud.",1,Big Bang Theory,37,6
562,Howard,2," How about liquid coolant? Maybe a little aquarium pump here, run some quarter inch PVC",1,Big Bang Theory,87,15
563,Penny,2," Guys, this is actually really simple.",1,Big Bang Theory,38,6
564,Howard,2," Hold on, honey, men at work. The PVC comes down here, maybe a little corrugated sheet metal as a radiator here.",1,Big Bang Theory,112,21
565,Leonard,2," Oh, really, show me where we put a drip tray, a sluice and an overflow reservoir?",1,Big Bang Theory,82,16
566,Sheldon,2, And if water is involved we're going to have to ground the crap out of the thing. ,1,Big Bang Theory,83,17
567,Penny,2," Guys, it's hot in here, I think I'll just take off all my clothes. ",1,Big Bang Theory,68,14
568,Leonard,2," Oh, I've got it. How about if we replace panels A, B and F and crossbar H with aircraft grade aluminium. ",1,Big Bang Theory,106,21
569,Sheldon,2," Right, then the entire thing's one big heat sink.",1,Big Bang Theory,50,9
570,Howard,2," Perfect, Leonard, why don't you and Sheldon go down to the junk yard and pick up about six square metres of scrap aluminium, Raj and I will run down to my lab and get the oxy-acetaline torch.",1,Big Bang Theory,192,37
571,Leonard,2, Meet back here in an hour?,1,Big Bang Theory,27,6
572,Howard,2, Done.,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
573,Leonard,2, Got it. .,1,Big Bang Theory,10,3
574,Penny,2," Okay, this place does look pretty good.",1,Big Bang Theory,40,7
578,Howard,3," Alright, just a few more feet, and. here we are gentlemen, the Gates of Elzebub.",1,Big Bang Theory,81,15
579,Sheldon,3, Good lord!,1,Big Bang Theory,11,2
580,Raj,3, Oooh.,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
581,Leonard,3," Don't panic, this is what the last 97 hours have been about.",1,Big Bang Theory,61,12
582,Howard,3," Stay frosty, there's a horde of armed goblins on the other side of that gate guarding the Sword of Azeroth.",1,Big Bang Theory,108,20
583,Leonard,3," Warriors, unsheathe your weapons, magic wielders raise your wands.",1,Big Bang Theory,67,9
584,Sheldon,3, Lock and load. ,1,Big Bang Theory,16,3
585,Howard,3," Raj, blow up the gates.",1,Big Bang Theory,24,5
586,Raj,3," Blowing the gates. Control, shift, B! Oh, my God, so many goblins!",1,Big Bang Theory,67,12
587,Howard,3," Don't just stand there, slash and move, slash and move.",1,Big Bang Theory,56,10
588,Leonard,3, Stay in formation.,1,Big Bang Theory,19,3
589,Howard,3," Leonard, you've got one on your tail.",1,Big Bang Theory,38,7
590,Leonard,3," That's alright, my tail's prehensile, I'll swat him off.",1,Big Bang Theory,57,9
591,Raj,3, I've got him Leonard. Tonight I spice my meat with goblin blood!,1,Big Bang Theory,65,12
592,Leonard,3," Raj, no, it's a trap, they're flanking us!",1,Big Bang Theory,43,8
593,Raj,3," Oooh, he's got me.",1,Big Bang Theory,19,4
594,Howard,3," Sheldon, he's got Raj, use your sleath spell. Sheldon! Sheldon!",1,Big Bang Theory,64,10
595,Sheldon,3, I've got the Sword of Azeroth!,1,Big Bang Theory,31,6
596,Leonard,3," Forget the sword, Sheldon, help Raj.",1,Big Bang Theory,37,6
597,Sheldon,3," There is no more Sheldon, I am the Swordmaster!",1,Big Bang Theory,48,9
598,Howard,3, Leonard look out!,1,Big Bang Theory,18,3
599,Leonard,3," Dammit man, we're dying here. ",1,Big Bang Theory,31,5
600,Sheldon,3," Goodbye, peasants. ",1,Big Bang Theory,20,2
601,Leonard,3, The bastard teleported. ,1,Big Bang Theory,25,3
602,Raj,3, He's selling the Sword of Azeroth on ebay.,1,Big Bang Theory,43,8
603,Leonard,3," You betrayed us for money, who are you?",1,Big Bang Theory,40,8
604,Sheldon,3," I'm a rogue knight elf, don't you people read character descriptions? Wait, wait, wait, somebody just clicked â€œbuy it now.â€ù",1,Big Bang Theory,128,20
605,Howard,3, I am the Swordmaster!,1,Big Bang Theory,22,4
607,Sheldon,3," Wooh, I'm all sweaty, anybody want to log on to second life and go swimming, I just built a virtual pool.",1,Big Bang Theory,106,21
608,Leonard,3," No, I can't look at you or your avatar right now.",1,Big Bang Theory,50,11
609,Howard,3, Sounds like your neighbour's home.,1,Big Bang Theory,35,5
610,Leonard,3, Excuse me.,1,Big Bang Theory,11,2
611,Sheldon,3, Don't forget the mail you took accidentally on purpose so you'd have an excuse to talk to her.,1,Big Bang Theory,95,18
612,Leonard,3," Oh, right, right right right right.",1,Big Bang Theory,36,6
613,Howard,3," Stealing snail mail, very old school, I like it. ",1,Big Bang Theory,50,9
614,Leonard,3," Penny, the mailman did it again, he  Oh! Sorry.",1,Big Bang Theory,48,9
615,Penny,3," Um, no, hi Leonard, this is Doug, Doug, this is my neighbour Leonard.",1,Big Bang Theory,70,13
617,Leonard,3, Not much. Bro. ,1,Big Bang Theory,16,3
618,Penny,3," Is, is everything okay.",1,Big Bang Theory,24,4
619,Leonard,3," Uh, yeah, uh, I just, I got your mail again, here.",1,Big Bang Theory,51,11
620,Penny,3," Thank you, I've got to talk to that mailman.",1,Big Bang Theory,45,9
621,Leonard,3," Oh no, that's probably not such a good idea. Civil servants have a documented propensity to, you know, snap. ",1,Big Bang Theory,110,19
622,Penny,3," Okay, well, thank you, again.",1,Big Bang Theory,30,5
623,Leonard,3," No problem. Bye. Oh, and, bye, bro! .",1,Big Bang Theory,38,8
624,Sheldon,3, Penny for your thoughts. ,1,Big Bang Theory,26,4
625,Raj,3, What's the matter.,1,Big Bang Theory,19,3
626,Leonard,3," No, I'm fine. Penny's fine, the guy she's kissing is really fine and",1,Big Bang Theory,69,13
627,Howard,3," Kissing, what kind of kissing? Cheeks? Lips? Chaste? French? ",1,Big Bang Theory,62,9
628,Leonard,3, What is wrong with you?,1,Big Bang Theory,24,5
629,Howard,3, I'm a romantic.,1,Big Bang Theory,16,3
630,Sheldon,3, Please don't tell me that your hopeless infatuation is devolving into pointless jealousy.,1,Big Bang Theory,90,13
631,Leonard,3," No, I'm not jealous, I'm just a little concerned for her. I didn't like the look of the guy that she was with.",1,Big Bang Theory,111,23
632,Howard,3, Because he looked better than you?,1,Big Bang Theory,35,6
633,Leonard,3, Yeah. He was kinda dreamy.,1,Big Bang Theory,27,5
634,Sheldon,3," Well, at least now you can retrieve the black box from the twisted smouldering wreckage that was once your fantasy of dating her, and analyse the data so that you don't crash into geek mountain again.",1,Big Bang Theory,201,36
635,Howard,3," I disagree, love is not a sprint, it's a marathon. A relentless pursuit that only ends when she falls into your arms. Or hits you with the pepper spray. ",1,Big Bang Theory,154,29
636,Leonard,3," Well, I'm done with Penny. I'm going to be more realistic and go after someone my own speed.",1,Big Bang Theory,93,18
637,Raj,3, Like who?,1,Big Bang Theory,10,2
638,Leonard,3, I don't know. Olivia Geiger?,1,Big Bang Theory,29,5
639,Sheldon,3, The dietician at the cafeteria with the limp and the lazy eye?,1,Big Bang Theory,63,12
640,Leonard,3, Yeah.,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
641,Sheldon,3," Well, I don't think you have a shot there. I have noticed that Lesley Winkle recently started shaving her legs. Now, given that winter is coming one can only assume that she is signalling sexual availability. ",1,Big Bang Theory,210,36
642,Howard,3," I don't know, you guys work in the same lab.",1,Big Bang Theory,45,10
643,Leonard,3, So?,1,Big Bang Theory,4,1
644,Howard,3," There are pitfalls, trust me, I know. When it comes to sexual harassment law I'm a bit of a self-taught expert. ",1,Big Bang Theory,113,21
645,Leonard,3," Look, Howard, if I were to ask Lesley Winkle out it would just be for dinner, I'm not going to walk into the lab, ask her to strip naked and dance for me.",1,Big Bang Theory,155,33
646,Howard,3," Oh, then you're probably okay.",1,Big Bang Theory,31,5
648,Leonard,3, Hello Lesley.,1,Big Bang Theory,14,2
650,Leonard,3, Lesley I would like to propose an experiment.,1,Big Bang Theory,46,8
652,Leonard,3," Right. Lesley, I would like to propose an experiment.",1,Big Bang Theory,54,9
654,Leonard,3," Pfff, I've done it, about two seconds, 2.6 for minestrone. Anyway, I was thinking more of a bio-social exploration with a neuro-chemical overlay. ",1,Big Bang Theory,147,23
656,Leonard,3," I was going to characterise it as the modification of our colleague/friendship paradigm, with the addition of a date-like component. But we don't need to quibble over terminology. ",1,Big Bang Theory,181,28
658,Leonard,3," There is a generally accepted pattern in this area, I would pick you up, take you to a restaurant, then we would see a movie, probably a romantic comedy featuring the talents of Hugh Grant or Sandra Bullock. ",1,Big Bang Theory,209,38
660,Leonard,3," Heartrate, pheromones, etc, yes. ",1,Big Bang Theory,34,4
662,Leonard,3," You mean, kiss you now?",1,Big Bang Theory,24,5
664,Leonard,3, Can you define the parameters of the kiss?,1,Big Bang Theory,43,8
666,Leonard,3, Thank you. . Shall I count down from three?,1,Big Bang Theory,44,9
669,Leonard,3," You proposed the experiment, I think you should present your findings first.",1,Big Bang Theory,77,12
671,Leonard,3, None?,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
673,Leonard,3," Ah. Well, thank you for your time.",1,Big Bang Theory,35,7
675,Leonard,3, None at all?,1,Big Bang Theory,13,3
677,Howard,3," Sheldon, if you were a robot, and I knew and you didn't, would you want me to tell you?",1,Big Bang Theory,88,19
678,Sheldon,3," That depends. When I learn that I'm a robot, will I be able to handle it?",1,Big Bang Theory,74,16
679,Howard,3," Maybe, although the history of science-fiction is not on your side. ",1,Big Bang Theory,69,11
680,Sheldon,3," Uh, let me ask you this. When I learn that I'm a robot, would I be bound by Asimov's three laws of robotics?",1,Big Bang Theory,109,23
681,Raj,3, You might be bound by them right now.,1,Big Bang Theory,38,8
682,Howard,3," That's true. Have you ever harmed a human being, or through inaction allowed a human being to come to harm?",1,Big Bang Theory,108,20
683,Sheldon,3, Of course not. ,1,Big Bang Theory,16,3
684,Howard,3," Have you ever harmed yourself, or allowed yourself to be harmed except in cases where a human being would have been endangered?",1,Big Bang Theory,128,22
685,Sheldon,3," Well, no.",1,Big Bang Theory,10,2
686,Howard,3, I smell robot. ,1,Big Bang Theory,16,3
687,Leonard,3," Hey, what's going on.",1,Big Bang Theory,22,4
688,Sheldon,3, The internet's been down for half an hour. ,1,Big Bang Theory,44,8
689,Raj,3," Also, Sheldon may be a robot. ",1,Big Bang Theory,31,6
690,Howard,3," So, how did it go with Lesley? ",1,Big Bang Theory,32,7
691,Leonard,3," Oh, we tried kissing, but the earth didn't move. I mean any more than the 383 miles that it was going to move anyway. ",1,Big Bang Theory,119,24
692,Sheldon,3," Oh, I've seen that look before. This is just going to be two weeks of moping and tedious emo songs, and calling me to come down to pet stores to look at cats. I don't know if I can take it. ",1,Big Bang Theory,191,41
693,Raj,3, You could power down.,1,Big Bang Theory,22,4
694,Howard,3," Well, as usual, Wolowitz has the solution. I happen to know a place where there are plenty of eligible women, and Leonard could have his pick.",1,Big Bang Theory,143,26
697,Howard,3," I think Mrs Tishman's got her eye on you. I've been there, you're in for a treat. ",1,Big Bang Theory,83,17
699,Sheldon,3," Oh, good lord.",1,Big Bang Theory,15,3
700,Leonard,3," You don't know me, you don't wear my chains God, that's a good song. ",1,Big Bang Theory,70,14
701,Sheldon,3," If you're compiling a mix CD for a double suicide.  Oh, I hope that scratching post is for you.",1,Big Bang Theory,96,19
702,Leonard,3," I know what you're thinking, I've taken your asthma into account. There's a feline geneticist in San Diego who has developed the cutest little hypo-allergenic calicos. ",1,Big Bang Theory,169,26
703,Sheldon,3," Leonard, listen to me",1,Big Bang Theory,22,4
704,Leonard,3," I've been thinking about names, I'm kind of torn between Einstein, Newton and Sergeant Fuzzyboots. ",1,Big Bang Theory,100,15
705,Sheldon,3," Leonard, do you really think you can satisfy your need for a relationship with a genetically altered cat?",1,Big Bang Theory,106,18
706,Leonard,3," Maybe, if it's a cute little cuddly cat.",1,Big Bang Theory,41,8
707,Sheldon,3," Oh, come on, Leonard! This is obviously about Penny. ",1,Big Bang Theory,54,9
708,Leonard,3," It doesn't matter. The woman's not interested in me, the woman rejected me. ",1,Big Bang Theory,77,13
709,Sheldon,3," Okay, look, I think that you have as much of a chance of having a sexual relationship with Penny as the Hubble Telescope does of discovering at the centre of every black hole is a little man with a flashlight searching for a circuit breaker. Nevertheless, I do feel obligated to point out to you that she did no reject you. You did not ask her out. ",1,Big Bang Theory,350,67
710,Leonard,3," You're right. I didn't ask her out, I should ask her out.",1,Big Bang Theory,58,12
711,Sheldon,3," No. No, now that was not my point. My point was, don't buy a cat. ",1,Big Bang Theory,67,15
712,Leonard,3," No, but you're right. I should march over there and ask her out. ",1,Big Bang Theory,66,13
713,Sheldon,3," Oh, goody, we're getting a cat. ",1,Big Bang Theory,33,6
715,Penny,3," Ah, hey Leonard.",1,Big Bang Theory,17,3
716,Leonard,3," Good afternoon Penny, so hi, hey. Uh I was wondering if you had plans for dinner.",1,Big Bang Theory,82,16
717,Penny,3," Uh, do you mean dinner tonight?",1,Big Bang Theory,32,6
718,Leonard,3," There is an inherent ambiguity in the word dinner. Technically it refers to the largest meal of the day whenever it is consumed, so, to clarify here, by dinner I mean supper.",1,Big Bang Theory,175,32
719,Penny,3, Supper?,1,Big Bang Theory,8,1
720,Leonard,3," Or dinner. I was thinking six thirty, if you can go, or a different time.",1,Big Bang Theory,74,15
721,Penny,3," Uh, six thirty's great.",1,Big Bang Theory,24,4
722,Leonard,3, Really? Great!,1,Big Bang Theory,15,2
723,Penny,3," Yeah, I like hanging out with you guys.",1,Big Bang Theory,40,8
724,Leonard,3, Us guys?,1,Big Bang Theory,9,2
725,Penny,3," You know, Sheldon, Howard, Raj, who all's coming?",1,Big Bang Theory,50,8
726,Leonard,3," They. might all be there. Or a subset of them might be there, uh, algebraically speaking there are too many unknowns, for example Sheldon had Quizznos for lunch, sometimes he finds that filling, other times he doesn't, it's no fault of Quizznos, they have a varied menu.",1,Big Bang Theory,271,47
727,Penny,3," Okay, whatever, it sounds like fun.",1,Big Bang Theory,36,6
728,Leonard,3, Great. Did we say a time?,1,Big Bang Theory,26,6
729,Penny,3, Six thirty.,1,Big Bang Theory,12,2
730,Leonard,3, And that's still good for you.,1,Big Bang Theory,31,6
731,Penny,3, It's fine.,1,Big Bang Theory,11,2
732,Leonard,3, Cos it's not carved in stone.,1,Big Bang Theory,30,6
733,Penny,3," No, six thirty's great.",1,Big Bang Theory,24,4
734,Leonard,3, I'll get my chisel.,1,Big Bang Theory,20,4
735,Penny,3, Why?,1,Big Bang Theory,5,1
736,Leonard,3," To carve the okay, I'll see you six thirty.",1,Big Bang Theory,44,9
738,Leonard,3, How do I look?,1,Big Bang Theory,15,4
739,Sheldon,3, Could you be more specific?,1,Big Bang Theory,28,5
740,Leonard,3, Can you tell I'm perspiring a little?,1,Big Bang Theory,38,7
741,Sheldon,3, No. The dark crescent-shaped patterns under your arms conceal it nicely. What time is your date?,1,Big Bang Theory,97,16
742,Leonard,3, Six thirty. ,1,Big Bang Theory,13,2
743,Sheldon,3," Perfect, that gives you two hours and fifteen minutes for that dense molecular cloud of Aramis to dissipate. ",1,Big Bang Theory,110,18
744,Leonard,3, Is it too much?,1,Big Bang Theory,16,4
745,Sheldon,3, Not if you're a rugby team. ,1,Big Bang Theory,29,6
746,Leonard,3," By the way, if it should ever come up, you didn't join us because you stuffed yourself with a chicken carbonara sub at Quizznos. ",1,Big Bang Theory,130,24
747,Sheldon,3, Why would I join you?,1,Big Bang Theory,22,5
748,Leonard,3," No reason. Oh, you know what, maybe this isn't such a good idea. ",1,Big Bang Theory,66,13
749,Sheldon,3," Oh, no, no, no, well now, there's always the possibility that alcohol and poor judgement on her part might lead to a nice romantic evening.",1,Big Bang Theory,140,25
750,Leonard,3," You're right, alcohol, poor judgement, it could go well.",1,Big Bang Theory,57,9
751,Sheldon,3," Of course, there's the other possibility that this date kicks off a rather unpleasant six months of the two of you passing awkwardly in the hall until one of you breaks down and moves to another zip code.",1,Big Bang Theory,205,38
752,Leonard,3, You could have stopped at â€œit could go well.â€ù,1,Big Bang Theory,50,9
753,Sheldon,3," If I could of, I would of. ",1,Big Bang Theory,28,7
754,Leonard,3," I mean, I'm a perfectly nice guy. There's no reason we couldn't go to the restaurant and have a lovely dinner. Maybe take a walk afterwards, talk about things we have in common, â€œyou love pottery? I love pottery!â€ù You know, there's a pause, we both know what's happening, I lean in, we kiss, it's a little tentative at first but then I realise, she's kissing me back, and she's biting my lower lip, you know, she wants me, this thing is going the distance, we're going to have sex! Oh God! Oh, my God!",1,Big Bang Theory,506,95
755,Sheldon,3, Is the sex starting now?,1,Big Bang Theory,25,5
756,Leonard,3, I'm having a panic attack.,1,Big Bang Theory,27,5
757,Sheldon,3," Oh, okay, well then, calm down.",1,Big Bang Theory,32,6
758,Leonard,3," If I could calm down I wouldn't be having a panic attack, that's why they call it a panic attack.",1,Big Bang Theory,98,20
759,Sheldon,3," Alright, alright, well, just, sit down, yes, sit down, now close your eyes.",1,Big Bang Theory,76,13
760,Leonard,3, Why?,1,Big Bang Theory,5,1
761,Sheldon,3, Just do it.,1,Big Bang Theory,12,3
762,Leonard,3, Okay.,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
763,Sheldon,3, Now try to increase your alpha-wave activity.,1,Big Bang Theory,46,7
764,Leonard,3, What?,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
765,Sheldon,3," It's a bio-feedback technique, it's relaxation through brain-wave manipulation, I read a paper about it in the Journal of American Neuroscience, it was a little sparsely sourced but I think the basic science is valid, I probably have it here somewhere.",1,Big Bang Theory,253,41
766,Leonard,3," Oh, who am I kidding, I can't go through with this, you need to call her and cancel.",1,Big Bang Theory,85,18
767,Sheldon,3, Me?,1,Big Bang Theory,4,1
768,Leonard,3, Yes.,1,Big Bang Theory,5,1
769,Sheldon,3, What should I tell her.,1,Big Bang Theory,24,5
770,Leonard,3, I don't know. Tell her I'm sick.,1,Big Bang Theory,33,7
771,Sheldon,3, Okay.,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
772,Leonard,3," Not the kind of illness that will make her want to come over and take care of me, but nothing so critical that she'll feel uncomfortable going out with me in the future if I want to try this again.",1,Big Bang Theory,198,40
773,Sheldon,3, Got it. So I'm assuming nothing venereal. I'll just tell her that you had a routine colonoscopy and haven't quite bounced back.,1,Big Bang Theory,128,22
774,Leonard,3, Give me the phone. ,1,Big Bang Theory,20,4
775,Sheldon,3, But I thought you wanted to cancel?,1,Big Bang Theory,36,7
776,Leonard,3, I can't because if I don't show up she'll still be expecting you.,1,Big Bang Theory,66,13
777,Sheldon,3, Why would she be expecting me? ,1,Big Bang Theory,32,6
778,Leonard,3," Stop asking me all these questions, I need to take another shower.",1,Big Bang Theory,67,12
780,Penny,3, So are the rest of the guys meeting us here?,1,Big Bang Theory,45,10
781,Leonard,3," Oh, yeah, no. Turns out that Raj and Howard had to work, and Sheldon had a colonoscopy and he hasn't quite bounced back yet. ",1,Big Bang Theory,126,24
782,Penny,3," Ooh, my uncle just had a colonoscopy.",1,Big Bang Theory,38,7
783,Leonard,3," You're kidding, well, then, that's something we have in common. ",1,Big Bang Theory,65,10
784,Penny,3, How?,1,Big Bang Theory,5,1
785,Leonard,3, We both have people in our lives who want to nip intestinal polyps in the bud. ,1,Big Bang Theory,80,16
786,Penny,3," So, what's new in the world of physics?",1,Big Bang Theory,40,8
787,Leonard,3, Nothing.,1,Big Bang Theory,9,1
788,Penny,3," Really, nothing?",1,Big Bang Theory,17,2
789,Leonard,3," Well, with the exception of string theory, not much has happened since the 1930's, and you can't prove string theory, at best you can say â€œhey, look, my idea has an internal logical consistency.â€ù",1,Big Bang Theory,200,34
790,Penny,3, Ah. Well I'm sure things will pick up. ,1,Big Bang Theory,40,8
791,Leonard,3, What's new at the Cheesecake Factory?,1,Big Bang Theory,38,6
792,Penny,3," Oh, uh, not much. We do have a chocolate key lime that's moving pretty well. ",1,Big Bang Theory,78,15
793,Leonard,3," Good. Good. And what about your, uh, hallway friend.",1,Big Bang Theory,53,9
794,Penny,3," Doug? Oh, yeah, I dunno, I mean, he's nice and funny, but",1,Big Bang Theory,58,12
796,Leonard,3," No,  You were saying, but",1,Big Bang Theory,26,5
797,Penny,3, I'd like a drink.,1,Big Bang Theory,18,4
798,Leonard,3, Just say the but thing about Doug and then I'll get her back. ,1,Big Bang Theory,63,13
799,Penny,3," Okay, well, you know, it's just me. I'm still getting over this break-up with Kurt, and this thing with Doug would be just rebound sex.",1,Big Bang Theory,136,25
800,Leonard,3," Ugh, don't get me started on rebound sex.",1,Big Bang Theory,42,8
801,Penny,3," It's just, it's my pattern. I break up, then I find some cute guy, and then it's just thirty six meaningless of well, you know. ",1,Big Bang Theory,129,25
802,Leonard,3," I'm not sure that I do. Um, is that one thirty-six hour experience, or is it thirty six hours spread out over say, one glorious summer.",1,Big Bang Theory,136,26
803,Penny,3," No, it's usually over a weekend, and trust me, you do not feel good after it.",1,Big Bang Theory,78,16
804,Leonard,3," Well, chafing, right?",1,Big Bang Theory,22,3
805,Penny,3, Emotionally.,1,Big Bang Theory,13,1
806,Leonard,3," Of course, yeah, emotional chafing. Hey, do you want to see something cool?  I can make this olive go into this glass without touching it. ",1,Big Bang Theory,140,25
807,Penny,3, How?,1,Big Bang Theory,5,1
808,Leonard,3, Physics. .,1,Big Bang Theory,11,2
809,Penny,3," Wow, centrifugal force!",1,Big Bang Theory,24,3
810,Leonard,3," Actually, it's centripetal force, which is an inward force generated by the glass acting on the olive.  Excuse me. Now, if you were riding on the olive, you'd be in a non-inertial reference frame, and would ",1,Big Bang Theory,208,36
811,Penny,3, Are you okay?,1,Big Bang Theory,14,3
812,Leonard,3," Yeah, I'm okay. Did you spill ketchup?",1,Big Bang Theory,39,7
813,Penny,3, No.,1,Big Bang Theory,4,1
814,Leonard,3, I'm not okay.,1,Big Bang Theory,14,3
816,Penny,3, Are you sure you don't want to go to the emergency room?,1,Big Bang Theory,57,12
817,Leonard,3," No, no, I'm okay, it's stopped bleeding.",1,Big Bang Theory,41,7
818,Penny,3," I know, but you did throw up. Isn't that a sign of a concussion?",1,Big Bang Theory,65,14
819,Leonard,3," Yes, but I get car sick too, so",1,Big Bang Theory,32,8
820,Penny,3, Okay.,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
821,Leonard,3," Sorry about your car, by the way.",1,Big Bang Theory,34,7
822,Penny,3," Oh, no, it's fine, you got most of it out the window. ",1,Big Bang Theory,55,12
823,Leonard,3, The poor guy on the bike. I had a nice time.,1,Big Bang Theory,45,11
824,Penny,3," Yeah, me too. Um, good night.  Leonard?",1,Big Bang Theory,40,7
825,Leonard,3, Yeah.,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
826,Penny,3, Was this supposed to be a date?,1,Big Bang Theory,32,7
827,Leonard,3," This? No. No, of course not, this was just you and me hanging out with a bunch of guys who didn't show up, because of work and a colonoscopy.",1,Big Bang Theory,142,29
828,Penny,3," Okay, I was just checking.",1,Big Bang Theory,27,5
829,Leonard,3," When I take a girl out on a date, and I do, she knows she's been dated. Capital D. Bold face, underline, like Day-ted. I think I might have a little concussion, I'm going to go lay down for a while, good night. ",1,Big Bang Theory,212,43
831,Sheldon,3," So, how was your date?",1,Big Bang Theory,23,5
832,Leonard,3, Awesome!,1,Big Bang Theory,9,1
833,Sheldon,3, Score one for liquor and poor judgement.,1,Big Bang Theory,41,7
837,Sheldon,4, I've been thinking about time travel again.,1,Big Bang Theory,44,7
838,Leonard,4," Why, did you hit a roadblock with invisibility?",1,Big Bang Theory,48,8
839,Sheldon,4," Put it on the back burner. Anyway, it occurs to me, if I ever did perfect a time machine, I'd just go into the past and give it to myself, thus eliminating the need for me to invent it in the first place.",1,Big Bang Theory,205,43
840,Leonard,4, Interesting.,1,Big Bang Theory,13,1
841,Sheldon,4," Yeah, it really takes the pressure off. ",1,Big Bang Theory,41,7
842,Leonard,4," Sounds like a breakthrough, should I call the science magazines and tell them to hold the front cover? ",1,Big Bang Theory,104,18
843,Sheldon,4," It's time travel, Leonard, I will have already done that. ",1,Big Bang Theory,59,10
844,Leonard,4, Then I guess congratulations are in order.,1,Big Bang Theory,43,7
845,Sheldon,4," No, congratulations will have been in order. You know, I'm not going to enjoy this party.",1,Big Bang Theory,90,16
846,Leonard,4," I know, I'm familiar with you.",1,Big Bang Theory,31,6
847,Sheldon,4," At the last department party, Dr Finkleday cornered me and talked about spelunking for 45 minutes.",1,Big Bang Theory,99,16
848,Leonard,4," Yes, I was there.",1,Big Bang Theory,18,4
849,Sheldon,4," You know what's interesting about caves, Leonard?",1,Big Bang Theory,50,7
850,Leonard,4, What?,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
851,Sheldon,4, Nothing.,1,Big Bang Theory,9,1
852,Leonard,4," Well then we'll avoid Finkleday, we'll meet the new department head, congratulate him, shake his hand and go. ",1,Big Bang Theory,111,18
853,Sheldon,4," How's this? Pleased to meet you, Dr Gablehouser. How fortunate for you that the University has chosen to hire you, despite the fact that you've done no original research in 25 years, and instead have written a series of popular books that reduce the great concepts of science to a series of anecdotes, each one dumbed down to accommodate the duration of an average bowel movement. Mahalo.",1,Big Bang Theory,389,67
854,Leonard,4, Mahalo's a nice touch. ,1,Big Bang Theory,24,4
855,Sheldon,4, Do you know there are only eight consonants in the Hawaiian language.,1,Big Bang Theory,70,12
856,Leonard,4," Interesting, you should lead with that.",1,Big Bang Theory,40,6
858,Raj,4," Oh, God, Look at this buffet. I love America.",1,Big Bang Theory,46,9
859,Leonard,4, You don't have buffets in India?,1,Big Bang Theory,33,6
860,Raj,4," Of course, but it's all Indian food. You can't find a bagel in Mumbai to save your life. Schmear me.",1,Big Bang Theory,101,20
861,Sheldon,4, Well here's an interesting turn of events.,1,Big Bang Theory,43,7
862,Leonard,4, What.  Howard brought a date?,1,Big Bang Theory,30,5
863,Sheldon,4, A more plausible explanation is that his work in robotics has made an amazing leap forward.,1,Big Bang Theory,92,16
864,Howard,4," Hey, what up, science bitches? May I introduce my special lady friend, Summer. ",1,Big Bang Theory,80,13
866,Howard,4, Right. Sorry.,1,Big Bang Theory,14,2
867,Leonard,4," Here comes our new boss, be polite.",1,Big Bang Theory,36,7
869,Howard,4, Howard Wolowitz.,1,Big Bang Theory,17,2
871,Sheldon,4, An actual real scientist.  How was that?,1,Big Bang Theory,41,7
873,Sheldon,4, I can't believe he fired me.,1,Big Bang Theory,29,6
874,Leonard,4," Well, you did call him a glorified high-school science teacher whose last successful experiment was lighting his own farts.",1,Big Bang Theory,124,19
875,Sheldon,4," In my defence, I prefaced that by saying â€œwith all due respect.â€ù",1,Big Bang Theory,69,12
877,Leonard,4, Morning,1,Big Bang Theory,8,1
878,Sheldon,4, Morning.,1,Big Bang Theory,9,1
879,Leonard,4, You're making eggs for breakfast?,1,Big Bang Theory,34,5
880,Sheldon,4," This isn't breakfast, it's an experiment. ",1,Big Bang Theory,43,6
881,Leonard,4, Huh? Cos it looks a lot like breakfast.,1,Big Bang Theory,40,8
882,Sheldon,4," I finally have the time to test my hypothesis, about the separation of the water molecules from the egg proteins, and its impact vis-a-vis taste.",1,Big Bang Theory,146,25
883,Leonard,4, Sounds yummy. I look forward to your work with bacon.,1,Big Bang Theory,54,10
884,Sheldon,4, As do I.,1,Big Bang Theory,9,3
885,Leonard,4," You know, I'm sure if you just apologised to Gablehauser he would give you your job back.",1,Big Bang Theory,90,17
886,Sheldon,4," I don't want my job back. I've spent the last three and a half years staring at greaseboards full of equations. Before that I spent four years working on my thesis. Before that I was in college, and before that, I was in the fifth grade. This is my first day off in decades, and I'm going to savour it.",1,Big Bang Theory,303,60
887,Leonard,4, Okay. I'll let you get back to fixing your eggs.,1,Big Bang Theory,49,10
888,Sheldon,4," I'm not just fixing my eggs, I'm fixing everyone's eggs.",1,Big Bang Theory,57,10
889,Leonard,4, And we all thank you.,1,Big Bang Theory,22,5
890,Sheldon,4, Use new eggs. .,1,Big Bang Theory,16,4
891,Penny,4," Hi, hey. I'm running out to the market, do you guys need anything?",1,Big Bang Theory,67,13
892,Sheldon,4," Oh, well this would be one of those circumstances that people unfamiliar with the law of large numbers would call a coincidence.",1,Big Bang Theory,129,22
893,Penny,4, I'm sorry?,1,Big Bang Theory,11,2
894,Sheldon,4, I need eggs. Four dozen should suffice.,1,Big Bang Theory,40,7
895,Penny,4, Four dozen?,1,Big Bang Theory,12,2
896,Sheldon,4," Yes, and evenly distributed amongst brown, white, free range, large, extra-large and jumbo.",1,Big Bang Theory,92,13
897,Penny,4," Okay, one more time?",1,Big Bang Theory,21,4
898,Sheldon,4," Never mind, you won't get it right, I'd better come with you.",1,Big Bang Theory,62,12
899,Penny,4," Oh, yay!",1,Big Bang Theory,9,2
901,Penny,4, How come you didn't go into work today.,1,Big Bang Theory,40,8
902,Sheldon,4," I'm taking a sabbatical, because I won't kow-tow to mediocre minds. ",1,Big Bang Theory,69,11
903,Penny,4," So you got canned, huh?",1,Big Bang Theory,24,5
904,Sheldon,4, Theoretical physicists do not get canned. But yeah. ,1,Big Bang Theory,53,8
905,Penny,4," Well, maybe it's all for the best, you know I always say, when one door closes, another one opens. ",1,Big Bang Theory,100,19
906,Sheldon,4," No it doesn't. Not unless the two doors are connected by relays, or there are motion sensors involved. ",1,Big Bang Theory,104,18
907,Penny,4," No, no, I meant",1,Big Bang Theory,16,4
908,Sheldon,4, Or the first door closing causes a change of air pressure that acts upon the second door.,1,Big Bang Theory,90,17
909,Penny,4, Never mind. ,1,Big Bang Theory,13,2
910,Sheldon,4," Slow down. Slow down, please slow down.",1,Big Bang Theory,40,7
911,Penny,4, We're fine.,1,Big Bang Theory,12,2
912,Sheldon,4," Look, you're not leaving yourself enough space between cars.",1,Big Bang Theory,61,9
913,Penny,4," Oh, sure I am.",1,Big Bang Theory,15,4
914,Sheldon,4," No, no. Let me do the math for you, this car weighs let's say 4,000lb, now add say 140 for me, 120 for you.",1,Big Bang Theory,108,24
915,Penny,4, 120?,1,Big Bang Theory,5,1
916,Sheldon,4," Oh, I'm sorry, did I insult you? Is your body mass somehow tied into your self worth?",1,Big Bang Theory,86,17
917,Penny,4," Well, yeah.",1,Big Bang Theory,12,2
918,Sheldon,4," Interesting. Anyway, that gives us a total weight of, let's say, 4,400lb.",1,Big Bang Theory,74,12
919,Penny,4," Let's say 4,390. ",1,Big Bang Theory,18,3
920,Sheldon,4," Fine. We're travelling forward at, good Lord, 51 miles an hour. Now let's assume that your brakes are new and the callipers are aligned, still, by the time we come to a stop, we'll be occupying the same space as that Buick in front of us, an impossibility that nature will quickly resolve into death, mutilation and oh look, they built a new put-put course.",1,Big Bang Theory,358,65
922,Sheldon,4," This is great. Look at me, out in the real world of ordinary people, just living their ordinary, colourless, workaday lives. ",1,Big Bang Theory,126,21
923,Penny,4, Thank you.,1,Big Bang Theory,11,2
924,Sheldon,4," No, thank you. And thank you, ordinary person. Hey, you want to hear an interesting thing about tomatoes.",1,Big Bang Theory,106,18
925,Penny,4," Uh, no, no not really. Listen, didn't you say you needed some eggs. ",1,Big Bang Theory,69,13
926,Sheldon,4," Uh, yes, but anyone who knows anything about the dynamics of bacterial growth knows to pick up their refrigerated foods on the way out of the supermarket.",1,Big Bang Theory,155,27
927,Penny,4," Oh, okay, well maybe you should start heading on out then. ",1,Big Bang Theory,60,11
928,Sheldon,4," No, this is fun. Oh, the thing about tomatoes, and I think you'll really enjoy this, is, they're shelved with the vegetables, but they're technically a fruit. ",1,Big Bang Theory,160,27
929,Penny,4, Interesting.,1,Big Bang Theory,13,1
930,Sheldon,4, Isn't it?,1,Big Bang Theory,10,2
931,Penny,4," No, I mean what you find enjoyable. ",1,Big Bang Theory,37,7
932,Sheldon,4, Oh boy.,1,Big Bang Theory,8,2
933,Penny,4, What now?,1,Big Bang Theory,10,2
934,Sheldon,4," Well, there's some value to taking a multivitamin, but the human body can only absorb so much, what you're buying here are the ingredients for very expensive urine. ",1,Big Bang Theory,166,28
935,Penny,4," Well, maybe that's what I was going for. ",1,Big Bang Theory,42,8
936,Sheldon,4, Well then you'll want some manganese.,1,Big Bang Theory,38,6
938,Sheldon,4, That was fun. Maybe tomorrow we can go to one of those big warehouse stores. ,1,Big Bang Theory,78,15
939,Penny,4," Oh, I don't know Sheldon, it's going to take me a while to recover from all the fun I had today. ",1,Big Bang Theory,98,21
940,Sheldon,4," Are you sure. There are a lot of advantages to buying in bulk. For example, I noticed that you purchase your tampons one month's supply at a time.",1,Big Bang Theory,147,28
941,Penny,4, What?,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
942,Sheldon,4," Well think about it, it's a product that doesn't spoil, and you're going to be needing them for at least the next thirty years.",1,Big Bang Theory,128,24
943,Penny,4, You want me to buy thirty years worth of tampons?,1,Big Bang Theory,50,10
944,Sheldon,4," Well, thirty, thirty five, hey, when did your mother go into menopause?",1,Big Bang Theory,72,12
945,Penny,4," Okay, I'm not talking about this with you.",1,Big Bang Theory,43,8
946,Sheldon,4," Oh, Penny, this is a natural human process, and we're talking about statistically significant savings. Now, if you assume 15 tampons per cycle and a 28 day cycle, are you fairly regular?  Okay, no warehouse store, but we're still on for put-put golf, right?",1,Big Bang Theory,258,44
948,Leonard,4," Hey, I just ran into Penny, she seemed upset about something.",1,Big Bang Theory,62,11
949,Sheldon,4, I think it's her time of the month. I marked the calendar for future reference. ,1,Big Bang Theory,81,15
950,Leonard,4, What's with the fish?,1,Big Bang Theory,22,4
951,Sheldon,4, It's an experiment. ,1,Big Bang Theory,21,3
952,Leonard,4, What happened to your scrambled egg research?,1,Big Bang Theory,46,7
953,Sheldon,4," Oh, that was a dead end. Scrambled eggs are as good as they're ever going to be.",1,Big Bang Theory,81,17
954,Leonard,4, So fish. ,1,Big Bang Theory,10,2
955,Sheldon,4," I read an article about Japanese scientists, who inserted DNA from luminous jellyfish into other animals, and I thought hey, fish nightlights.",1,Big Bang Theory,143,22
956,Leonard,4, Fish nightlights.,1,Big Bang Theory,18,2
957,Sheldon,4, It's a billion dollar idea. Shhhhh!,1,Big Bang Theory,36,6
958,Leonard,4," Mum's the word. Sheldon, are you sure you don't want to just apologise to Gablehauser and get your job back.",1,Big Bang Theory,109,20
959,Sheldon,4," Oh, no, no, no. No, I've too much to do.",1,Big Bang Theory,41,10
960,Leonard,4, Like luminous fish.,1,Big Bang Theory,20,3
961,Sheldon,4, Shhhhh!,1,Big Bang Theory,8,1
962,Leonard,4, Right I didn't.,1,Big Bang Theory,16,3
963,Sheldon,4," That's just the beginning. I also have an idea for a bulk mail-order feminine hygiene company. Oh, glow in the dark tampons! Leonard, we're going to be rich. ",1,Big Bang Theory,159,28
965,Leonard,4, Thank you for coming on such short notice.,1,Big Bang Theory,43,8
967,Leonard,4," I didn't know what else to do, he's lost all focus, every day he's got a new obsession.  This is a particularly disturbing one. ",1,Big Bang Theory,129,24
968,Sheldon,4, Mommy.,1,Big Bang Theory,7,1
970,Sheldon,4, You called my mother?,1,Big Bang Theory,22,4
972,Sheldon,4, Thank you.,1,Big Bang Theory,11,2
974,Sheldon,4," I was working with luminous fish, and I thought, hey, loom! Mom, what are you doing here?",1,Big Bang Theory,90,17
976,Sheldon,4," I know, but why?",1,Big Bang Theory,17,4
977,Leonard,4, Because one of the great minds of the twenty-first century is raising glow-in-the-dark fish and weaving sarapes. ,1,Big Bang Theory,114,17
978,Sheldon,4," This is not a sarape. This is a poncho. A sarape is open at the sides, a poncho is closed, this is a poncho, and neither is a reason to call someone's mother. ",1,Big Bang Theory,160,33
979,Leonard,4," Really, when was the last time you left the house.",1,Big Bang Theory,51,10
980,Sheldon,4, I went to the market with Penny.,1,Big Bang Theory,33,7
981,Leonard,4, That was three weeks ago.,1,Big Bang Theory,26,5
982,Sheldon,4," Well then buckle up, in the next four to eight days she's going to get very crabby.",1,Big Bang Theory,84,17
984,Sheldon,4," Yes, well I'm not a child, I'm a grown man capable of living my life as I see fit. And I certainly don't need someone telling on me to my mother. ",1,Big Bang Theory,147,31
985,Leonard,4, Where are you going?,1,Big Bang Theory,21,4
986,Sheldon,4," To my room, and no-one's allowed in. ",1,Big Bang Theory,38,7
988,Leonard,4, Oh. ,1,Big Bang Theory,5,1
990,Leonard,4, I see.,1,Big Bang Theory,7,2
993,Leonard,4, Sheldon? Your mum made dinner.,1,Big Bang Theory,31,5
994,Sheldon,4, I'm not hungry. ,1,Big Bang Theory,17,3
996,Penny,4, Are we so sure that's a bad thing?,1,Big Bang Theory,35,8
998,Howard,4," Excuse me for being so bold, but I now see where Sheldon gets his smouldering good looks.",1,Big Bang Theory,90,17
1000,Leonard,4," That is a lovely story, um, are we going to do anything about Sheldon?",1,Big Bang Theory,71,14
1002,Leonard,4, Sounds like a wise man.,1,Big Bang Theory,24,5
1004,Penny,4, Has Shelly ever freaked out like this before.,1,Big Bang Theory,46,8
1006,Penny,4, What happened?,1,Big Bang Theory,15,2
1008,Leonard,4, A death ray?,1,Big Bang Theory,13,3
1010,Leonard,4," No, we're not, we're not, not a couple, two singles, like those individually wrapped slices of cheese that. are friends.",1,Big Bang Theory,121,20
1012,Howard,4, Oh yeah.,1,Big Bang Theory,9,2
1014,Penny,4," Oh my God, this is the best cobbler I've ever had.",1,Big Bang Theory,51,11
1016,Penny,4, Love?,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
1018,Howard,4," Hey, look who's come out.",1,Big Bang Theory,26,5
1020,Leonard,4," This is ridiculous. Dammit, Sheldon, snap out of it. You're a physicist, you belong at the University doing research, not hiding in your room. ",1,Big Bang Theory,144,24
1024,Sheldon,4, Morning.,1,Big Bang Theory,9,1
1026,Sheldon,4, It's my idea of what DNA would look like in a silicon based life form. ,1,Big Bang Theory,72,15
1028,Sheldon,4," What do you want, mom?",1,Big Bang Theory,23,5
1030,Sheldon,4, Yeah.,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
1032,Sheldon,4, What for?,1,Big Bang Theory,10,2
1034,Sheldon,4, No.,1,Big Bang Theory,4,1
1036,Sheldon,4," I'm not going to apologise, I didn't say anything that wasn't true. ",1,Big Bang Theory,69,12
1038,Sheldon,4, Why not?,1,Big Bang Theory,9,2
1040,Sheldon,4, Wouldn't have been any ass-kickings if that stupid death ray had worked.,1,Big Bang Theory,73,12
1043,Leonard,4, Really? That's impressive.,1,Big Bang Theory,27,3
1049,Sheldon,4, Dr Gablehouser.,1,Big Bang Theory,16,2
1052,Sheldon,4," Um, as you know, several weeks ago in our first encounter we may have gotten off on the wrong foot, when I called you an idiot. And I just wanted to say that I was wrong. To point it out. ",1,Big Bang Theory,189,40
1060,Sheldon,4, Okay.,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
1061,Leonard,4," Hey, how did it go?",1,Big Bang Theory,20,5
1062,Sheldon,4, I got my job back.,1,Big Bang Theory,19,5
1063,Leonard,4, Really? What happened?,1,Big Bang Theory,23,3
1064,Sheldon,4, I'm not quite sure. It involves a part of the human experience that has always eluded me. ,1,Big Bang Theory,91,17
1065,Leonard,4, That narrows it down. ,1,Big Bang Theory,23,4
1068,Sheldon,4," Thanks, mom. Mom?",1,Big Bang Theory,18,3
1070,Sheldon,4, Is Dr Gablehouser going to be my new daddy?,1,Big Bang Theory,44,9
1075,Sheldon,5," Alright, I'm moving my infantry division, augmented by a battalion of Orcs from Lord of the Rings, we flank the Tennessee Volunteers, and the North once again wins the Battle of Gettysburg.",1,Big Bang Theory,190,32
1076,Howard,5," Not so fast, remember the South still has two infantry divisions, plus Superman and Godzilla.",1,Big Bang Theory,94,15
1077,Leonard,5," No, no, no, no, Orcs are magic, Superman is vulnerable to magic, not to mention, you already lost Godzilla to the Illinois Cavalry and Hulk.",1,Big Bang Theory,141,25
1078,Raj,5, Why don't you just have Robert E. Lee charge the line with Shiva and Ganesh.,1,Big Bang Theory,77,15
1079,Penny,5," Hi, you guys ready to order?",1,Big Bang Theory,29,6
1080,Howard,5," Hang on, honey. Shiva and Ganesh? The Hindu Gods against the entire Union army?",1,Big Bang Theory,80,14
1081,Leonard,5, And Orcs!,1,Big Bang Theory,10,2
1082,Penny,5, I'll be back.,1,Big Bang Theory,14,3
1083,Raj,5," Excuse me, Ganesh is the remover of obstacles, and Shiva is the destroyer. When the smoke clears, Abraham Lincoln will be speaking Hindi and drinking mint juleps. ",1,Big Bang Theory,164,27
1084,Penny,5," Alright, my boss says you either have to order, or leave and never come back. ",1,Big Bang Theory,79,15
1085,Howard,5, What do you recommend for someone who worked up a man-sized appetite from a morning of weight training and cardio-funk?,1,Big Bang Theory,120,20
1086,Penny,5, A shower. ,1,Big Bang Theory,11,2
1087,Howard,5, I'll take the heart smart platter.,1,Big Bang Theory,35,6
1088,Penny,5," Alright, thank you, and Sheldon.",1,Big Bang Theory,33,5
1089,Sheldon,5," We don't eat here, I don't know what's good.",1,Big Bang Theory,45,9
1090,Penny,5," Well, it's all good. ",1,Big Bang Theory,22,4
1091,Sheldon,5, Statistically unlikely. ,1,Big Bang Theory,25,2
1092,Leonard,5," Just get a hamburger, you like hamburgers.",1,Big Bang Theory,43,7
1093,Sheldon,5," I like the hamburgers where we usually have hamburgers, you can't make the assumption that I'll like the hamburgers here. ",1,Big Bang Theory,123,20
1094,Leonard,5, I'm sorry. Give him a hamburger. ,1,Big Bang Theory,34,6
1095,Penny,5," Uh, which one, the Classic Burger, the Ranch House Burger, the Barbecue Burger or the Kobe burger?",1,Big Bang Theory,99,17
1096,Sheldon,5, Can't we just go to Big Boy? They only have one burger. The Big Boy. ,1,Big Bang Theory,70,15
1097,Penny,5, The Barbecue Burger is like the Big Boy. ,1,Big Bang Theory,42,8
1098,Sheldon,5," Excuse me, in a world that already includes the Big Boy, why would I settle for something like a Big Boy?",1,Big Bang Theory,106,21
1099,Penny,5, Because you are not at Big Boy!,1,Big Bang Theory,32,7
1100,Sheldon,5," Fine, I'll have the Barbecue Burger. ",1,Big Bang Theory,38,6
1101,Leonard,5, Make it two. ,1,Big Bang Theory,14,3
1102,Sheldon,5, Waitresses don't yell at you at Big Boy. ,1,Big Bang Theory,42,8
1104,Leonard,5, Hey Lesley. ,1,Big Bang Theory,13,2
1106,Sheldon,5, We don't. This is a disturbing aberration. ,1,Big Bang Theory,44,7
1107,Leonard,5," Lesley, this is Penny, she lives across the hall from Sheldon and me. ",1,Big Bang Theory,71,13
1108,Howard,5, And walks in quiet beauty like the night. ,1,Big Bang Theory,43,8
1109,Penny,5," Howard, I've asked you not to do that. ",1,Big Bang Theory,40,8
1110,Leonard,5, Lesley and I do research together at the University. ,1,Big Bang Theory,54,9
1111,Penny,5," Oh, wow, a girl scientist. ",1,Big Bang Theory,28,5
1113,Leonard,5, What happened to Elliot Wong?,1,Big Bang Theory,30,5
1115,Leonard,5," Yeah, sure, why not.",1,Big Bang Theory,21,4
1117,Leonard,5, Why at my place?,1,Big Bang Theory,17,4
1119,Penny,5," Yeah, you too. Leonard, I didn't know you played the cello?",1,Big Bang Theory,60,11
1120,Leonard,5," Yeah, my parents felt that naming me Leonard and putting me in advanced placement classes wasn't getting me beaten up enough. ",1,Big Bang Theory,127,21
1121,Howard,5," If you're into music, I happen to be a human beatbox. ",1,Big Bang Theory,55,11
1122,Penny,5," Really?  I'm actually not that into music. So hey, your friend's really cute, anything going on with you two. ",1,Big Bang Theory,111,19
1123,Leonard,5," Lesley? No, no-oh, what are you kidding?",1,Big Bang Theory,41,7
1124,Sheldon,5," He asked her out once, it was an embarrassing failure. ",1,Big Bang Theory,56,10
1125,Leonard,5, Thank you Sheldon.,1,Big Bang Theory,19,3
1126,Sheldon,5," Oh, I'm sorry, was that supposed to be a secret?",1,Big Bang Theory,49,10
1127,Penny,5," Oh, that's too bad, you guys would make a cute couple. ",1,Big Bang Theory,56,11
1128,Raj,5, Oh dear.,1,Big Bang Theory,9,2
1129,Howard,5, What's the matter?,1,Big Bang Theory,19,3
1130,Raj,5, She didn't take my order.,1,Big Bang Theory,26,5
1131,Howard,5, How can she take your order when you're too neurotic to talk to her.,1,Big Bang Theory,69,14
1132,Raj,5," Nevertheless, this will be reflected in her tip. ",1,Big Bang Theory,50,8
1134,Leonard,5," What did Penny mean, you'd make a cute couple?",1,Big Bang Theory,47,9
1135,Sheldon,5," Well I assume she meant that the two of you together would constitute a couple that others might consider cute. An alternate, and somewhat less likely interpretation, is that you could manufacture one. As in, oh look, Leonard and Lesley made Mr and Mrs Goldfarb, aren't they adorable. ",1,Big Bang Theory,286,48
1136,Leonard,5," If Penny didn't know that Lesley had already turned me down then that would unambiguously mean that she, Penny, thought that I should her, Lesley, out, indicating that she, Penny, had no interest in me asking her, Penny, out. But because she did know that I had asked Lesley out and that she, Lesley, had turned me down then she, Penny, could be offering consolation. That's too bad, you would have made a cute couple. But while thinking, good, Leonard remains available. ",1,Big Bang Theory,473,82
1137,Sheldon,5," You're a lucky man, Leonard. ",1,Big Bang Theory,30,5
1138,Leonard,5, How so?,1,Big Bang Theory,8,2
1139,Sheldon,5, You're talking to one of the three men in the Western hemisphere capable of following that train of thought. ,1,Big Bang Theory,110,19
1140,Leonard,5," Well, what do you think.",1,Big Bang Theory,25,5
1141,Sheldon,5," I said I could follow it, I didn't say I cared.",1,Big Bang Theory,48,11
1144,Leonard,5, Thank you.,1,Big Bang Theory,11,2
1149,Leonard,5," That was fun, Lesley, thanks for including me. ",1,Big Bang Theory,48,8
1151,Leonard,5," Uh, sure, why not. ",1,Big Bang Theory,20,4
1153,Leonard,5, Really?,1,Big Bang Theory,8,1
1155,Leonard,5, I thought you weren't interested in me.,1,Big Bang Theory,40,7
1157,Leonard,5, You mean my cello?,1,Big Bang Theory,19,4
1159,Leonard,5, No kidding?,1,Big Bang Theory,12,2
1161,Leonard,5," Gee, uh",1,Big Bang Theory,8,2
1163,Leonard,5, Penny? What about her?,1,Big Bang Theory,23,4
1165,Leonard,5," Well, I did have a poppy seed bagel for breakfast, which could give a positive urine test for opiates but certainly not dilate my pupils, so I guess there's no point in bringing it up. ",1,Big Bang Theory,186,35
1167,Leonard,5," No. No, there's nothing going on between Penny and me.",1,Big Bang Theory,55,10
1169,Leonard,5," Yeah. Yeah, I guess I am. ",1,Big Bang Theory,27,6
1171,Leonard,5," Yeah, yeah it is good. Did you want to start now?",1,Big Bang Theory,50,11
1173,Leonard,5, Oh. Okay. A little musical foreplay. Terrific. ,1,Big Bang Theory,48,7
1174,Leonard,5," I'm good, I'm good to go. ",1,Big Bang Theory,27,6
1177,Penny,5," Oh, hey Sheldon, what's going on?",1,Big Bang Theory,34,6
1178,Sheldon,5, I need your opinion on a matter of semiotics.,1,Big Bang Theory,46,9
1179,Penny,5, I'm sorry?,1,Big Bang Theory,11,2
1180,Sheldon,5," Semiotics. The study of signs and symbols, it's a branch of philosophy related to linguistics.",1,Big Bang Theory,95,15
1181,Penny,5," Okay, sweetie, I know you think you're explaining yourself, but you're really not. ",1,Big Bang Theory,84,13
1182,Sheldon,5, Just come with me.,1,Big Bang Theory,19,4
1183,Sheldon,5, Well?,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
1184,Penny,5, Well what?,1,Big Bang Theory,11,2
1185,Sheldon,5, What does it mean?,1,Big Bang Theory,19,4
1186,Penny,5," Oh, come on, you went to college.",1,Big Bang Theory,34,7
1187,Sheldon,5," Yes, but I was eleven.",1,Big Bang Theory,23,5
1188,Penny,5," Alright, look, a tie on the doorknob usually means someone doesn't want to be disturbed because they're, you know, getting busy. ",1,Big Bang Theory,130,21
1189,Sheldon,5, So you're saying Leonard has a girl in there.,1,Big Bang Theory,46,9
1190,Penny,5," Well, either that or he's lost his tie rack and gotten really into Bryan Adams. ",1,Big Bang Theory,81,15
1192,Penny,5, We really shouldn't be standing here. ,1,Big Bang Theory,39,6
1193,Sheldon,5, This is very awkward.,1,Big Bang Theory,22,4
1194,Penny,5," Oh, come on, you know, Leonard's had girls over before, right?",1,Big Bang Theory,63,11
1195,Sheldon,5," Oh, yes, but there's usually planning, courtship and advance notice. Last time I was able to book a cruise to the Arctic to see a solar eclipse. ",1,Big Bang Theory,146,27
1196,Penny,5," Wait, you had to leave the state because your roommate was having sex?",1,Big Bang Theory,71,13
1197,Sheldon,5," I didn't have to, the dates just happened to coincide. ",1,Big Bang Theory,56,10
1198,Penny,5," So, do you know who's in there?",1,Big Bang Theory,32,7
1199,Sheldon,5," Well, there's Leonard.  And he's either with Lesley Winkle or a 1930's gangster. ",1,Big Bang Theory,82,13
1200,Penny,5," Hmmm. Good for him. Good for Leonard. Okay, night.",1,Big Bang Theory,51,9
1201,Sheldon,5," No, no, wait, hold on. ",1,Big Bang Theory,24,5
1202,Penny,5, What's the matter?,1,Big Bang Theory,19,3
1203,Sheldon,5," I don't know what the protocol is here. Do I stay, do I leave? Do I wait to greet them with a refreshing beverage? ",1,Big Bang Theory,116,24
1204,Penny,5," Gee, Sheldon, you're asking the wrong girl. I'm usually on the other side of the tie. ",1,Big Bang Theory,87,16
1205,Sheldon,5," Hi, Leonard. It's me, Sheldon. In the living room. I just, I wanted you to know I saw the tie. Message received. You're welcome. You carry on. Give my best to Lesley. ",1,Big Bang Theory,168,32
1208,Sheldon,5," Big boy!  Someone touched my board. Oh God, my board. Leonard! Leonard!",1,Big Bang Theory,72,12
1209,Leonard,5," Hey, what's the matter? ",1,Big Bang Theory,25,4
1210,Sheldon,5," My equations, someone's tampered with my equations. ",1,Big Bang Theory,53,7
1211,Leonard,5, Are you sure?,1,Big Bang Theory,14,3
1212,Sheldon,5," Of course I'm sure. Look at the beta-function of quantum chrono-dynamics, the sign's been changed. ",1,Big Bang Theory,100,15
1213,Leonard,5, Oh yeah. But doesn't that fix the problem you've been having?,1,Big Bang Theory,62,11
1214,Sheldon,5," Are you insane? Are you out of your mind? Are you. hey look, that fixes the problem I've been having. ",1,Big Bang Theory,103,20
1216,Sheldon,5, You did this?,1,Big Bang Theory,14,3
1218,Sheldon,5, Cool?,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
1220,Leonard,5," Thank you, I'll see you at work. ",1,Big Bang Theory,34,7
1221,Sheldon,5," Uh-duh, hold on, hold on!",1,Big Bang Theory,26,5
1223,Sheldon,5, Who told you you could touch my board?,1,Big Bang Theory,39,8
1225,Sheldon,5, I don't come into your house and touch your board.,1,Big Bang Theory,51,10
1227,Sheldon,5," Oh, that is so so",1,Big Bang Theory,18,5
1229,Sheldon,5," Inconsiderate, that is the adjective, inconsiderate. ",1,Big Bang Theory,54,6
1231,Leonard,5," You can stare at your board all day Sheldon, she's still going to be right. ",1,Big Bang Theory,77,15
1232,Sheldon,5," I'm not staring, I'm mulling.",1,Big Bang Theory,30,5
1233,Penny,5," Oh, hey Leonard.",1,Big Bang Theory,17,3
1234,Leonard,5," Oh, hi.",1,Big Bang Theory,8,2
1235,Penny,5," So, how's it going?",1,Big Bang Theory,20,4
1236,Leonard,5, Pretty good. ,1,Big Bang Theory,14,2
1237,Penny,5," Just pretty good, I'd think you were doing very good. ",1,Big Bang Theory,55,10
1238,Leonard,5," Pretty, very, there's really no objective scale for delineating variations of good, why do you ask?",1,Big Bang Theory,100,16
1239,Penny,5," Well, a little bird told me that you and Lesley hooked up last night. ",1,Big Bang Theory,71,14
1240,Leonard,5, Sheldon!,1,Big Bang Theory,9,1
1241,Sheldon,5, I'm coming.,1,Big Bang Theory,12,2
1242,Penny,5," So, is it serious, do you like her?",1,Big Bang Theory,36,8
1243,Leonard,5," Wuh, I don't. th-th-th-that's really two different questions, uh, I'm not. Sheldon, we have to go! ",1,Big Bang Theory,100,16
1244,Sheldon,5," Boy, you're wound awfully tight for a man who just had sexual intercourse. ",1,Big Bang Theory,76,13
1245,Penny,5," Alright, well, I'll talk to you later, but, I am so happy for you Leonard. ",1,Big Bang Theory,76,15
1246,Leonard,5," Thank you. What did she mean, she's happy for me? Is she happy because I'm seeing someone, or is she happy because she thinks that I'm happy, because anyone who cared for someone would want them to be happy, even if the reason for their happiness made the first person unhappy. You know, because the second person, though happy, is now romantically unavailable to the first person.",1,Big Bang Theory,382,67
1247,Sheldon,5, Do you realise I may have to share a Nobel Prize with your booty call?,1,Big Bang Theory,71,15
1248,Leonard,5," You know what, I'm being ridiculous. But who cares what Penny thinks, Lesley is a terrific girl, she's attractive, we like each other, she's extremely intelligent.",1,Big Bang Theory,164,26
1249,Sheldon,5, She's not that intelligent.,1,Big Bang Theory,28,4
1250,Leonard,5, She fixed your equation.,1,Big Bang Theory,25,4
1251,Sheldon,5, She got lucky.,1,Big Bang Theory,15,3
1252,Leonard,5, You don't believe in luck.,1,Big Bang Theory,27,5
1253,Sheldon,5, I don't have to believe in it for her to be lucky. ,1,Big Bang Theory,52,12
1254,Leonard,5," Regardless, I have a chance at a real relationship with Lesley, I'm not going to pass that up for some hypothetical future happiness with a woman who may or may not want me to be happy with a woman who is currently making me happy. ",1,Big Bang Theory,233,45
1255,Sheldon,5, Leonard?,1,Big Bang Theory,9,1
1256,Leonard,5, Yeah. ,1,Big Bang Theory,7,1
1257,Sheldon,5, I still don't care. ,1,Big Bang Theory,21,4
1259,Leonard,5," Hey, Lesley.",1,Big Bang Theory,13,2
1261,Leonard,5, Brrrr. Why are you smashing a flash frozen banana.,1,Big Bang Theory,51,9
1263,Leonard,5, So anyway  Hello.,1,Big Bang Theory,18,3
1265,Leonard,5, Just extending the intimacy. Do you want to slip over to the radiation lab and share a decontamination shower?,1,Big Bang Theory,111,19
1267,Leonard,5," I'm not sure, but I think I'm about to discover how the banana felt. ",1,Big Bang Theory,70,14
1269,Leonard,5, Who wouldn't? ,1,Big Bang Theory,15,2
1271,Leonard,5," Yeah, well, I'm just glad to be a part of it. So what happens now?",1,Big Bang Theory,67,15
1273,Leonard,5, Oh. Okay. Thank you.,1,Big Bang Theory,21,4
1275,Leonard,5, You want to make plans for New Years.,1,Big Bang Theory,38,8
1277,Leonard,5, Sorry.,1,Big Bang Theory,7,1
1278,Howard,5," Hey, look, it's Doctor Stud!",1,Big Bang Theory,29,5
1279,Leonard,5, Doctor what?,1,Big Bang Theory,13,2
1280,Howard,5, The blogosphere is a-buzzing with news of you and Lesley Winkle making eine kleine bang-bang music. ,1,Big Bang Theory,101,16
1281,Leonard,5, Wha how did it get on the internet?,1,Big Bang Theory,36,8
1282,Howard,5, I put it there. ,1,Big Bang Theory,17,4
1283,Leonard,5," Well, how did you know about it?",1,Big Bang Theory,33,7
1284,Raj,5, A little bird told us. Apparently you are a magnificent beast. ,1,Big Bang Theory,64,11
1285,Leonard,5," Well, that part's true! ",1,Big Bang Theory,25,4
1287,Sheldon,5," You know, I think I may have misjudged this restaurant. ",1,Big Bang Theory,57,10
1288,Leonard,5, No kidding.,1,Big Bang Theory,12,2
1289,Sheldon,5," I won't go out on a limb, but I think we may be looking at my new Tuesday hamburger. ",1,Big Bang Theory,86,19
1290,Leonard,5, Your old Tuesday hamburger will be so broken hearted. ,1,Big Bang Theory,55,9
1291,Sheldon,5," Way ahead of you. I was thinking of moving Big Boy to Thursdays, and just dropping Soup Plantation. ",1,Big Bang Theory,101,18
1292,Leonard,5, Really?,1,Big Bang Theory,8,1
1293,Sheldon,5," Yeah, the name always confused me anyway, Soup Plantation. You can't grow soup. ",1,Big Bang Theory,81,13
1294,Penny,5," So, how's everything. ",1,Big Bang Theory,23,3
1295,Sheldon,5," Terrific, you'll be happy to know that I plan to come here every Tuesday night for the foreseeable future.",1,Big Bang Theory,107,19
1296,Penny,5," Really, oh yay!",1,Big Bang Theory,16,3
1297,Sheldon,5, Who do I speak to about permanently reserving this table? ,1,Big Bang Theory,59,10
1298,Penny,5," Um, I don't know, a psychiatrist? So hey, how are things with you and Lesley? ",1,Big Bang Theory,79,15
1299,Leonard,5," Oh, to be honest, I don't think it's going to work out. ",1,Big Bang Theory,57,12
1300,Penny,5," Oh, oh that's too bad. Well hey, don't worry, I'm sure there is someone out there who is just right for you. .",1,Big Bang Theory,111,23
1301,Leonard,5, Well what did she mean by that? Was that just a generic platitude or was that a subtle bid for attention? ,1,Big Bang Theory,107,21
1302,Sheldon,5, You know why this hamburger surpasses the Big Boy? This is a single decker hamburger whereas the Big Boy is a double decker. This has a much more satisfying meat to bun to condiment ratio. ,1,Big Bang Theory,190,35
1303,Leonard,5, Are you even listening to me?,1,Big Bang Theory,30,6
1304,Sheldon,5," Of course I'm listening. Blah blah, hopeless Penny delusion, blah blah blah.",1,Big Bang Theory,77,12
1305,Leonard,5," Okay then. You know, you can grow the ingredients for soup. . ",1,Big Bang Theory,63,12
1307,Raj,6," Okay, if no-one else will say it, I will. We really suck at paintball.",1,Big Bang Theory,71,14
1308,Howard,6, That was absolutely humiliating.,1,Big Bang Theory,33,4
1309,Leonard,6," Oh, come on, some battles you win, some battles you lose.",1,Big Bang Theory,58,11
1310,Howard,6," Yes, but you don't have to lose to Kyle Bernstein's Bar-Mitzvah party. ",1,Big Bang Theory,72,12
1311,Leonard,6," I think we have to acknowledge, those were some fairly savage pre-adolescent Jews. ",1,Big Bang Theory,84,13
1312,Sheldon,6," You know, we were annihilated by our own incompetence and the inability of some people to follow the chain of command. ",1,Big Bang Theory,120,21
1313,Leonard,6," Sheldon, let it go.",1,Big Bang Theory,20,4
1314,Sheldon,6," No, I want to talk about the fact that Wolowitz shot me in the back. ",1,Big Bang Theory,70,15
1315,Howard,6," I shot you for good reason, you were leading us into disaster. ",1,Big Bang Theory,64,12
1316,Sheldon,6," I was giving clear, concise orders. ",1,Big Bang Theory,37,6
1317,Leonard,6," You hid behind a tree yelling â€œget the kid in the yarmulkah, get the kid in the yarmulkah.â€ù",1,Big Bang Theory,96,18
1318,Penny,6," Oh, hey guys.",1,Big Bang Theory,14,3
1319,Leonard,6, Hello Penny.,1,Big Bang Theory,13,2
1320,Howard,6, Morning ma'am. ,1,Big Bang Theory,16,2
1321,Penny,6," So, how was paintball, did you have fun?",1,Big Bang Theory,41,8
1322,Sheldon,6," Sure, if you consider being fragged by your own troops fun.  You clear space on your calendar, there will be an enquiry.",1,Big Bang Theory,121,22
1323,Penny,6," Okay, um, oh hey, I'm having a party on Saturday so if you guys are around you should come by.",1,Big Bang Theory,95,20
1324,Leonard,6, A party? ,1,Big Bang Theory,10,2
1325,Penny,6, Yeah.,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
1326,Howard,6, A boy-girl party?,1,Big Bang Theory,18,3
1327,Penny,6," Well, there will be boys, and there will be girls, and it is a party. So, it'll just be a bunch of my friends, we'll have some beer, do a little dancing",1,Big Bang Theory,153,32
1328,Sheldon,6, Dancing?,1,Big Bang Theory,9,1
1329,Leonard,6," Yeah, I don't know, Penny",1,Big Bang Theory,26,5
1330,Sheldon,6," The thing is, we're not.",1,Big Bang Theory,25,5
1331,Leonard,6, We're really more.,1,Big Bang Theory,19,3
1332,Sheldon,6, No.,1,Big Bang Theory,4,1
1333,Leonard,6," But thanks, thanks for thinking of us.",1,Big Bang Theory,39,7
1334,Penny,6," Are you sure? Come on, it's Halloween.",1,Big Bang Theory,39,7
1335,Sheldon,6, A Halloween party?,1,Big Bang Theory,19,3
1336,Howard,6," As in, costumes? ",1,Big Bang Theory,18,3
1337,Penny,6," Well, yeah. ",1,Big Bang Theory,13,2
1338,Leonard,6, Is there a theme?,1,Big Bang Theory,18,4
1339,Penny,6," Um, yeah, Halloween.",1,Big Bang Theory,21,3
1340,Sheldon,6," Yes, but are the costumes random, or genre specific? ",1,Big Bang Theory,54,9
1341,Penny,6," As usual, I'm not following.",1,Big Bang Theory,29,5
1342,Leonard,6," He's asking if we can come as anyone from science-fiction, fantasy",1,Big Bang Theory,67,11
1343,Penny,6, Sure.,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
1344,Sheldon,6, What about comic-books?,1,Big Bang Theory,24,3
1345,Penny,6, Fine.,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
1346,Sheldon,6, Anime?,1,Big Bang Theory,7,1
1347,Penny,6, Of course.,1,Big Bang Theory,11,2
1348,Sheldon,6," TV , film, D&D, Manga, Greek Gods, Roman Gods, Norse Gods",1,Big Bang Theory,58,11
1349,Penny,6," Anything you want, okay? Any costume you want. Bye. ",1,Big Bang Theory,53,9
1350,Howard,6," Gentlemen, to the sewing machines.",1,Big Bang Theory,35,5
1352,Leonard,6, I'll get it. ,1,Big Bang Theory,14,3
1353,Howard,6, Bjow ,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
1354,Leonard,6," Oh, no. ",1,Big Bang Theory,9,2
1355,Sheldon,6, Oh no! ,1,Big Bang Theory,8,2
1356,Raj,6, Make way for the fastest man alive.  Oh no!,1,Big Bang Theory,44,9
1357,Sheldon,6," See, this is why I wanted to have a costume meeting. ",1,Big Bang Theory,54,11
1358,Leonard,6," We all have other costumes, we can change.",1,Big Bang Theory,43,8
1359,Raj,6," Or, we could walk right behind each other all night and look like one person going really fast. ",1,Big Bang Theory,97,18
1360,Howard,6," No, no, no, it's a boy-girl party, this Flash runs solo. ",1,Big Bang Theory,58,11
1361,Leonard,6," Okay, how about this, nobody gets to be The Flash, we all change, agreed?",1,Big Bang Theory,74,14
1363,Leonard,6, I call Frodo!,1,Big Bang Theory,14,3
1366,Raj,6," Hey. Sorry I'm late, but my hammer got stuck in the door on the bus.",1,Big Bang Theory,69,15
1367,Leonard,6, You went with Thor?,1,Big Bang Theory,20,4
1368,Raj,6," What? Just because I'm Indian I can't be a Norse God? No, no, no, Raj has to be an Indian God. That's racism. I mean, look at Wolowitz, he's not English, but he's dressed like Peter Pan. Sheldon is neither sound nor light, but he's obviously the Doppler Effect. ",1,Big Bang Theory,263,49
1369,Howard,6," I'm not Peter Pan, I'm Robin Hood. ",1,Big Bang Theory,36,7
1370,Raj,6," Really, because I saw Peter Pan, and you're dressed exactly like Cathy Rigby. She was a little bigger than you, but it's basically the same look, man. ",1,Big Bang Theory,152,27
1371,Leonard,6," Hey, Sheldon, there's something I want to talk to you about before we go to the party.",1,Big Bang Theory,87,17
1372,Sheldon,6," I don't care if anybody gets it, I'm going as the Doppler Effect. ",1,Big Bang Theory,67,13
1373,Leonard,6," No, it's not",1,Big Bang Theory,13,3
1374,Sheldon,6," If I have to, I can demonstrate. Neeeeoooowwwww!",1,Big Bang Theory,49,8
1375,Leonard,6," Terrific. Um, this party is my first chance for Penny to see me in the context of her social group, and I need you not to embarrass me tonight. ",1,Big Bang Theory,145,29
1376,Sheldon,6," Well, what exactly do you mean by embarrass you?",1,Big Bang Theory,49,9
1377,Leonard,6," For example, tonight no-one needs to know that my middle name is Leakey. ",1,Big Bang Theory,74,13
1378,Sheldon,6," Well, there's nothing embarrassing about that, your father worked with Lewis Leakey, a great anthropologist. It had nothing to do with your bed-wetting. ",1,Big Bang Theory,154,23
1379,Leonard,6, All I'm saying is that this party is the perfect opportunity for Penny to see me as a member of her peer group. A potential close friend and perhaps more. I don't want to look like a dork. ,1,Big Bang Theory,190,38
1381,Howard,6," Just a heads up fellas, if anyone gets lucky I've got a dozen condoms in my quiver. ",1,Big Bang Theory,85,17
1382,Penny,6," Oh, hey guys. ",1,Big Bang Theory,15,3
1383,Leonard,6," Hey, sorry we're late. ",1,Big Bang Theory,24,4
1384,Sheldon,6, And you said the party starts at seven. ,1,Big Bang Theory,41,8
1385,Penny,6," Well, yeah, when you start a party at seven, no-one shows up at, you know, seven. ",1,Big Bang Theory,83,16
1386,Penny,6," Yes. Yes it is. Okay, well, um, come on in. ",1,Big Bang Theory,45,10
1387,Howard,6," What, are all the girls in the bathroom?",1,Big Bang Theory,41,8
1388,Penny,6," Probably, but in their own homes. ",1,Big Bang Theory,35,6
1389,Sheldon,6, So what time does the costume parade start? ,1,Big Bang Theory,45,8
1390,Penny,6, The parade?,1,Big Bang Theory,12,2
1391,Sheldon,6," Yeah, so the judges can give out the prizes for best costume, you know, most frightening, most authentic, most accurate visual representation of a scientific principle.",1,Big Bang Theory,169,26
1392,Penny,6," Oh, Sheldon, I'm sorry but there aren't going to be any parades or judges or prizes. ",1,Big Bang Theory,86,16
1393,Sheldon,6, This party is just going to suck. ,1,Big Bang Theory,35,7
1394,Penny,6," No, come on, it's going to be fun, and you all look great, I mean, look at you, Thor, and, oh, Peter Pan, that's so cute.",1,Big Bang Theory,122,26
1395,Leonard,6," Actually, Penny, he's Rob",1,Big Bang Theory,26,4
1396,Howard,6, I'm Peter Pan! And I've got a handful of pixie dust with your name on it. ,1,Big Bang Theory,75,16
1397,Penny,6," No you don't. Oh, hey, what's Sheldon supposed to be.",1,Big Bang Theory,54,10
1398,Leonard,6," Oh, he's the Doppler Effect.",1,Big Bang Theory,29,5
1399,Sheldon,6, Yes. It's the apparent change in the frequency of a wave caused by relative motion between the source of the wave and the observer. ,1,Big Bang Theory,133,24
1400,Penny,6," Oh, sure, I see it now, the Doppler Effect. Alright, I've got to shower, you guys um, make yourselves comfortable. ",1,Big Bang Theory,116,20
1401,Leonard,6, Okay. ,1,Big Bang Theory,7,1
1402,Sheldon,6," See, people get it. ",1,Big Bang Theory,21,4
1403,Raj,6," Mmmm, by Odin's beard, this is good Chex Mix. ",1,Big Bang Theory,47,9
1404,Howard,6," No thanks, peanuts, I can't afford to swell up in these tights. ",1,Big Bang Theory,65,12
1405,Sheldon,6," I'm confused. If there's no costume parade, what are we doing here? ",1,Big Bang Theory,69,12
1406,Leonard,6, We're socialising. Meeting new people. ,1,Big Bang Theory,40,5
1407,Sheldon,6, Telepathically?,1,Big Bang Theory,16,1
1408,Penny,6," Oh hey, when did you get here, Hi!",1,Big Bang Theory,35,8
1409,Raj,6," Penny is wearing the worst Catwoman costume I have ever seen, and that includes Halle Berry's.",1,Big Bang Theory,95,16
1410,Leonard,6," She's not Catwoman, she's just a generic cat.",1,Big Bang Theory,46,8
1411,Sheldon,6, And that's the kind of sloppy costuming which results from a lack of rules and competition.,1,Big Bang Theory,92,16
1412,Howard,6," Hey guys, check out the sexy nurse. I believe it's time for me to turn my head and cough. ",1,Big Bang Theory,91,19
1413,Raj,6, What is your move?,1,Big Bang Theory,19,4
1414,Howard,6," I'm going to use the mirror technique. She brushes her hair back, I brush my hair back, she shrugs, I shrug, subconsciously she's thinking we're in sync, we belong together.",1,Big Bang Theory,174,30
1415,Leonard,6, Where do you get this stuff?,1,Big Bang Theory,29,6
1416,Howard,6," You know, psychology journals, internet research, and there's this great show on VH1 about how to pick up girls. ",1,Big Bang Theory,114,19
1417,Raj,6," Oh, if only I had his confidence. I have such difficulty speaking to women. Or around women. Or at times, even effeminate men. ",1,Big Bang Theory,128,23
1418,Howard,6," If that's a working stethoscope, maybe you'd like to hear my heart skip a beat.",1,Big Bang Theory,80,15
1420,Howard,6," No, seriously, you can, I have transient idiopathic arrhythmia.",1,Big Bang Theory,64,9
1421,Leonard,6," I want to get to know Penny's friends, I just, I don't know how to talk to these people. ",1,Big Bang Theory,90,19
1422,Sheldon,6," Well, I actually might be able to help.",1,Big Bang Theory,40,8
1423,Leonard,6, How so?,1,Big Bang Theory,8,2
1424,Sheldon,6," Like Jane Goodall observing the apes, I initially saw their interactions as confusing and unstructured, but patterns emerge, they have their own language if you will. ",1,Big Bang Theory,168,26
1425,Leonard,6, Go on.,1,Big Bang Theory,7,2
1426,Sheldon,6," Well, it seems that the newcomer approaches the existing group with the greeting â€œHow wasted am I?â€ù which is met with an approving chorus of â€œDude.â€ù",1,Big Bang Theory,157,26
1427,Leonard,6, Then what happens?,1,Big Bang Theory,19,3
1428,Sheldon,6, That's as far as I've gotten.,1,Big Bang Theory,30,6
1429,Leonard,6," This is ridiculous, I'm jumping in.",1,Big Bang Theory,36,6
1430,Sheldon,6, Good luck. ,1,Big Bang Theory,12,2
1431,Leonard,6," No, you're coming with me.",1,Big Bang Theory,27,5
1432,Sheldon,6," Oh, I hardly think so. ",1,Big Bang Theory,24,5
1433,Leonard,6, Come on.,1,Big Bang Theory,9,2
1434,Sheldon,6, Aren't you afraid I'll embarrass you?,1,Big Bang Theory,38,6
1435,Leonard,6, Yes. But I need a wing-man.,1,Big Bang Theory,28,6
1436,Sheldon,6," Alright, but if we're going to use flight metaphors I'm much more suited to being the guy from the FAA, analysing wreckage. ",1,Big Bang Theory,125,22
1438,Leonard,6, Hi.,1,Big Bang Theory,4,1
1439,Sheldon,6, Hello.,1,Big Bang Theory,7,1
1441,Sheldon,6, Me? I'll give you a hint. Neeeeooooowwwww!,1,Big Bang Theory,43,7
1443,Sheldon,6, Close! Neeeeeoooooowwwww!,1,Big Bang Theory,26,2
1446,Sheldon,6, Neeeeeooooowwwwww!,1,Big Bang Theory,19,1
1448,Sheldon,6, I'm the Doppler Effect. ,1,Big Bang Theory,25,4
1450,Leonard,6, Why don't you just tell people you're a zebra?,1,Big Bang Theory,47,9
1451,Sheldon,6," Well, why don't you just tell people you're one of the seven dwarves. ",1,Big Bang Theory,71,13
1452,Leonard,6, Because I'm Frodo.,1,Big Bang Theory,19,3
1453,Sheldon,6," Yes, well, I'm the Doppler Effect. ",1,Big Bang Theory,36,6
1454,Leonard,6, Oh no.,1,Big Bang Theory,7,2
1455,Sheldon,6, What?,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
1456,Leonard,6, That's Penny's ex-boyfriend.,1,Big Bang Theory,29,3
1457,Sheldon,6, What do you suppose he's doing here? Besides disrupting the local gravity field. ,1,Big Bang Theory,82,13
1458,Leonard,6," If he were any bigger, he'd have moons orbiting him.",1,Big Bang Theory,53,10
1459,Sheldon,6," Oh, snap. So I guess we'll be leaving now. ",1,Big Bang Theory,44,9
1460,Leonard,6," Why should we leave? For all we know, he crashed the party and Penny doesn't even want him here. .",1,Big Bang Theory,99,20
1461,Sheldon,6, You have a back-up hypothesis. ,1,Big Bang Theory,32,5
1462,Leonard,6, Maybe they just want to be friends. ,1,Big Bang Theory,37,7
1463,Sheldon,6," Or maybe she wants to be friends, and he wants something more. ",1,Big Bang Theory,64,12
1464,Leonard,6, Then he and I are on equal ground.,1,Big Bang Theory,35,8
1465,Sheldon,6," Yes, but you're much closer to it than he is. ",1,Big Bang Theory,47,10
1466,Leonard,6," Look, if this was 15,000 years ago, by virtue of his size and strength, Kurt would be entitled to his choice of female partners.",1,Big Bang Theory,129,24
1467,Sheldon,6," And male partners. Animal partners. Large primordial eggplants, pretty much whatever tickled his fancy. ",1,Big Bang Theory,105,14
1468,Leonard,6," Yes, but our society has undergone a paradigm shift, in the information age, Sheldon, you and I are the alpha males. We shouldn't have to back down. ",1,Big Bang Theory,150,27
1469,Sheldon,6, True. Why don't you text him that and see if he backs down?,1,Big Bang Theory,60,13
1470,Leonard,6, No. I'm going to assert my dominance face to face. ,1,Big Bang Theory,52,10
1471,Sheldon,6," Face to face? Are you going to wait for him to sit down, or are you going to stand on a coffee table?",1,Big Bang Theory,102,23
1472,Leonard,6, Hello Penny. Hello Kurt.,1,Big Bang Theory,25,4
1473,Penny,6," Oh, hey guys. You having a good time?",1,Big Bang Theory,38,8
1474,Sheldon,6," Given the reaction to my costume, this party is a scathing indictment of the American education system. ",1,Big Bang Theory,105,17
1476,Sheldon,6, Yet another child left behind. ,1,Big Bang Theory,32,5
1478,Leonard,6," No, I'm a Hobbit.",1,Big Bang Theory,18,4
1480,Leonard,6," Uh, a Hobbit is a mortal Halfling inhabitant of Middle Earth, whereas an Elf is an immortal tall warrior. ",1,Big Bang Theory,107,19
1482,Sheldon,6," Because he is neither tall nor immortal, and none of us could be The Flash. ",1,Big Bang Theory,77,15
1484,Leonard,6, I think we're all talking to Penny here.,1,Big Bang Theory,41,8
1485,Sheldon,6, I'm not. No offence. ,1,Big Bang Theory,22,4
1487,Penny,6," Alright Kurt, be nice.",1,Big Bang Theory,23,4
1489,Penny,6, Kurt!,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
1490,Leonard,6," Okay, I understand your impulse to try to physically intimidate me. I mean, you can't compete with me on an intellectual level and so you're driven to animalistic puffery. ",1,Big Bang Theory,173,29
1492,Penny,6," Of course not, no, he's not, you're not, right Leonard? ",1,Big Bang Theory,57,10
1493,Leonard,6," No, I said animalistic. Of course we're all animals, but some of us have climbed a little higher on the evolutionary tree. ",1,Big Bang Theory,124,22
1494,Sheldon,6," If he understands that, you're in trouble. ",1,Big Bang Theory,44,7
1496,Sheldon,6, You're in trouble. ,1,Big Bang Theory,20,3
1498,Penny,6," Okay, Kurt, please.",1,Big Bang Theory,20,3
1499,Leonard,6," No, Penny, it's okay, I can handle this. I'm not a dwarf, I'm a Hobbit. A Hobbit. Are misfiring neurons in your hippocampus preventing the conversion from short-term to long-term memory?",1,Big Bang Theory,187,31
1501,Leonard,6, A homo-habilus discovering his opposable thumbs says what?,1,Big Bang Theory,59,8
1503,Leonard,6, I think I've made my point.,1,Big Bang Theory,28,6
1505,Sheldon,6," Let me remind you, while my moral support is absolute, in a physical confrontation I will be less than useless. ",1,Big Bang Theory,113,20
1506,Leonard,6," There's not going to be a confrontation, in fact I doubt if he can even spell confrontation.",1,Big Bang Theory,93,17
1508,Penny,6," Kurt, put him down this instant. ",1,Big Bang Theory,34,6
1510,Penny,6," I don't care, I'm finishing it, put him down. ",1,Big Bang Theory,47,9
1512,Sheldon,6, He's a Hobbit! I've got your back. ,1,Big Bang Theory,36,7
1513,Penny,6," Leonard, are you okay.",1,Big Bang Theory,23,4
1514,Leonard,6," Yeah, no, I'm fine. It's good, it's a good party, thanks for having us, it's just getting a little late so.",1,Big Bang Theory,108,21
1515,Penny,6," Oh, okay, alright, well thank you for coming. ",1,Big Bang Theory,47,8
1516,Sheldon,6," Happy Halloween.  If it's any consolation, I thought that homo-habilus line really put him in his place. ",1,Big Bang Theory,106,17
1518,Leonard,6, What's that?,1,Big Bang Theory,13,2
1519,Sheldon,6, Tea. When people are upset the cultural convention is to bring them hot beverages. There there. You want to talk about it?,1,Big Bang Theory,123,22
1520,Leonard,6, No.,1,Big Bang Theory,4,1
1521,Sheldon,6, Good. There there was really all I had. ,1,Big Bang Theory,41,8
1522,Leonard,6, Good night Sheldon.,1,Big Bang Theory,20,3
1523,Sheldon,6, Good night Leonard. ,1,Big Bang Theory,21,3
1524,Penny,6, Hey Leonard.,1,Big Bang Theory,13,2
1525,Leonard,6, Hi Penny.,1,Big Bang Theory,10,2
1526,Penny,6," Hey, I just wanted to make sure you're okay.",1,Big Bang Theory,45,9
1527,Leonard,6, I'm fine. ,1,Big Bang Theory,11,2
1528,Penny,6, I'm so sorry about what happened.,1,Big Bang Theory,34,6
1529,Leonard,6, It's not your fault.,1,Big Bang Theory,21,4
1530,Penny,6," Yes it is. That's why I broke up with him, he always does stuff like that. ",1,Big Bang Theory,76,16
1531,Leonard,6, So why was he at your party?,1,Big Bang Theory,29,7
1532,Penny,6," Well, I ran into him last week and, he was just, all apologetic, about how he's changed, he was just going on and on and I believed him, and I'm an idiot because I always believe guys like that and I can't go back to my party because he's there, and I know you don't want to hear this and I'm upset and I'm really drunk and I just want to ",1,Big Bang Theory,340,71
1533,Leonard,6, There there. ,1,Big Bang Theory,14,2
1534,Penny,6," God, what is wrong with me.",1,Big Bang Theory,28,6
1535,Leonard,6," Nothing, you're perfect.",1,Big Bang Theory,25,3
1536,Penny,6," Gah, I'm not perfect.",1,Big Bang Theory,22,4
1537,Leonard,6, Yes you are. ,1,Big Bang Theory,14,3
1538,Penny,6," You really think so, don't you? ",1,Big Bang Theory,33,6
1539,Leonard,6, Penny?,1,Big Bang Theory,7,1
1540,Penny,6, Yeah. ,1,Big Bang Theory,7,1
1541,Leonard,6, How much have you had to drink tonight?,1,Big Bang Theory,40,8
1542,Penny,6, Just. a lot. ,1,Big Bang Theory,14,3
1543,Leonard,6," Are you sure that your being drunk, and your being angry with Kurt doesn't have something to do with what's going on here?",1,Big Bang Theory,123,23
1544,Penny,6," It might. Boy, you're really smart.",1,Big Bang Theory,36,6
1545,Leonard,6," Yeah, I'm a frickin' genius. ",1,Big Bang Theory,30,5
1546,Penny,6," Leonard, you are so great. Why can't all guys be like you? ",1,Big Bang Theory,60,12
1547,Leonard,6," Because if all guys were like me, the human race couldn't survive. ",1,Big Bang Theory,68,12
1548,Penny,6, I should probably go.,1,Big Bang Theory,22,4
1549,Leonard,6, Probably. ,1,Big Bang Theory,11,1
1550,Penny,6, Thank you. ,1,Big Bang Theory,12,2
1551,Leonard,6," That's right, you saw what you saw. That's how we roll in The Shire. ",1,Big Bang Theory,70,14
1553,Sheldon,6, Coming. ,1,Big Bang Theory,9,1
1554,Howard,6," Hey, have you seen Koothrapali?",1,Big Bang Theory,32,5
1555,Sheldon,6, He's not here. Maybe the Avenger summoned him. ,1,Big Bang Theory,48,8
1556,Howard,6," He's not the Marvel comic story, he's the original Norse God. ",1,Big Bang Theory,63,11
1557,Sheldon,6, Thank you for the clarification. ,1,Big Bang Theory,34,5
1558,Howard,6, I'm supposed to give him a ride home.,1,Big Bang Theory,38,8
1559,Sheldon,6, Well I'm sure he'll be fine. He has his hammer. ,1,Big Bang Theory,49,10
1563,Howard,7," Watch this, it's really cool. Call Leonard Hofstadter.",1,Big Bang Theory,55,8
1565,Howard,7, No. Call Leonard Hofstadter.,1,Big Bang Theory,29,4
1567,Howard,7, No.,1,Big Bang Theory,4,1
1568,Leonard,7," Here, let me try. Call McFlono McFloonyloo. Heh-heh. ",1,Big Bang Theory,54,8
1570,Raj,7," Oh, that's very impressive. And a little racist. ",1,Big Bang Theory,50,8
1571,Leonard,7, So? We'll start now.,1,Big Bang Theory,21,4
1572,Sheldon,7," Yes, first we have to decide if those lost six minutes will be coming out of game time, bathroom time or the pizza break.",1,Big Bang Theory,122,24
1573,Raj,7," We can split it two, two and two.",1,Big Bang Theory,34,8
1574,Howard,7, If we're having anchovies on the pizza we can't take it out of bathroom time. ,1,Big Bang Theory,79,15
1575,Sheldon,7," Oh, what fresh hell is this?",1,Big Bang Theory,29,6
1576,Leonard,7," Hey Penny, come on in.",1,Big Bang Theory,23,5
1577,Penny,7, Hey guys. ,1,Big Bang Theory,11,2
1578,Howard,7," See a Penny, pick her up, and all the day you'll have good luck.",1,Big Bang Theory,65,14
1579,Penny,7," No you won't. Uh, can I hide out here for a while.",1,Big Bang Theory,51,12
1580,Leonard,7, Sure. What's going on.,1,Big Bang Theory,23,4
1581,Penny,7," Well, there's this girl I know from back in Nebraska, Christie, well anyway she called me up and she's like â€œHey, how's California,â€ù and I'm like â€œAwesomeâ€ù â€˜cos, you know, it's not Nebraska, and the next thing I know she's invited herself out here to stay with me. ",1,Big Bang Theory,276,48
1582,Penny,7," Anyway, she got here today, and she's just been in my apartment, yakkety-yakking about every guy she's slept with in Omaha, which is basically every guy in Omaha, and washing the sluttiest collection of underwear you have ever seen in my bathroom sink.",1,Big Bang Theory,253,43
1583,Howard,7," Well, is she doing it one thong at a time, or does she just throw it all in, like some sort of erotic bouillabaisse.",1,Big Bang Theory,117,24
1584,Penny,7, He really needs to dial it down.,1,Big Bang Theory,33,7
1585,Leonard,7," So, if you don't like this Christie, why are you letting her stay? ",1,Big Bang Theory,68,13
1586,Penny,7," Well, she was engaged to my cousin while she was sleeping with my brother, so she's kind of family. ",1,Big Bang Theory,101,19
1587,Sheldon,7," You know, I apologise for my earlier outburst, who needs Halo when we can be regaled with the delightfully folksy tale of the whore of Omaha?",1,Big Bang Theory,142,26
1588,Leonard,7," Oh, I don't think she's a whore.",1,Big Bang Theory,33,7
1589,Penny,7," No, yeah she's definitely a whore. I mean, she has absolutely no standards, this one time, she was at where's Howard?",1,Big Bang Theory,118,21
1590,Howard,7," Bonjour mademoiselle, I understand you're new in town. ",1,Big Bang Theory,56,8
1591,Sheldon,7, Oh good grief.,1,Big Bang Theory,15,3
1593,Penny,7," Ugh, I cannot believe Christie let Howard into my apartment. ",1,Big Bang Theory,62,10
1594,Leonard,7," Okay, fine, we'll just play one on one until he gets back. ",1,Big Bang Theory,60,12
1595,Sheldon,7," One on one? We don't play one on one, we play teams, not one on one. One on one!",1,Big Bang Theory,81,19
1596,Leonard,7, Well the only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut Raj in half.,1,Big Bang Theory,76,18
1597,Raj,7," Oh, sure, cut the foreigner in half, there's a billion more where he came from. ",1,Big Bang Theory,81,15
1598,Penny,7," Hey, if you guys need a fourth, I'll play.",1,Big Bang Theory,43,9
1599,Leonard,7, Great idea.,1,Big Bang Theory,12,2
1600,Sheldon,7," Uh, no. The wheel was a great idea. Relativity was a great idea. This is a notion, and a rather sucky one at that. ",1,Big Bang Theory,116,24
1601,Penny,7, Why?,1,Big Bang Theory,5,1
1602,Sheldon,7," Why? Oh, Penny, Penny, Penny.",1,Big Bang Theory,30,5
1603,Penny,7," Oh, what, what, what? ",1,Big Bang Theory,23,4
1604,Sheldon,7," This is a complex battle simulation with a steep learning curve, there are myriad weapons, vehicles and strategies to master, not to mention an extremely intricate back-story.",1,Big Bang Theory,176,27
1605,Penny,7," Oh cool, whose head did I just blow off? ",1,Big Bang Theory,42,9
1606,Sheldon,7, Mine. ,1,Big Bang Theory,7,1
1607,Penny,7," Okay, I got this, lock and load boys. ",1,Big Bang Theory,39,8
1608,Leonard,7, It's the only way we can play teams. ,1,Big Bang Theory,38,8
1609,Sheldon,7," Yes, but whoever's her partner will be hamstrung by her lack of experience and not to mention that fact that sh. ",1,Big Bang Theory,114,21
1610,Penny,7," Ha-ha, there goes your head again.",1,Big Bang Theory,35,6
1611,Sheldon,7," Okay, this isn't at all good sportsmanship to shoot somebody who's just respawned, you need to give them a chance to  now come on!",1,Big Bang Theory,131,24
1612,Sheldon,7," Raj, Raj, she's got me cornered, cover me.",1,Big Bang Theory,43,8
1613,Penny,7," Cover this, suckers. Ha-ha-ha!",1,Big Bang Theory,31,4
1614,Leonard,7," Penny, you are on fire.",1,Big Bang Theory,24,5
1615,Penny,7," Yeah, so is Sheldon. ",1,Big Bang Theory,22,4
1616,Sheldon,7," Okay, that's it, I don't know how, but she is cheating. No-one can be that attractive and be this skilled at a video game. ",1,Big Bang Theory,124,24
1617,Penny,7," Wait, wait, Sheldon, come back, you forgot something. ",1,Big Bang Theory,55,8
1618,Sheldon,7, What?,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
1619,Penny,7," This plasma grenade.  Ha! Look, it's raining you! ",1,Big Bang Theory,51,8
1620,Sheldon,7," You laugh now, you just wait until you need tech support. ",1,Big Bang Theory,59,11
1621,Penny,7," Gosh, he's kind of a sore loser, isn't he?",1,Big Bang Theory,43,9
1622,Leonard,7," Well, to be fair, he is also a rather unpleasant winner. ",1,Big Bang Theory,58,11
1623,Penny,7," Well, it's been fun.",1,Big Bang Theory,21,4
1624,Leonard,7," You know, Penny, we make such a good team, maybe we could enter a couple of Halo tournaments sometime.",1,Big Bang Theory,103,19
1625,Penny,7, Or we could just have a life. ,1,Big Bang Theory,31,7
1626,Leonard,7, I guess for you that's an option.,1,Big Bang Theory,34,7
1627,Penny,7," Good night, Leonard.",1,Big Bang Theory,21,3
1628,Leonard,7, Good night.,1,Big Bang Theory,12,2
1629,Penny,7," As usual, nice talking to you Raj  ",1,Big Bang Theory,36,7
1630,Raj,7, What do you suppose she meant by that?,1,Big Bang Theory,39,8
1631,Leonard,7," She's an enigma, Raj. ",1,Big Bang Theory,23,4
1632,Sheldon,7," And another thing, there's a certain ethic to the game, Penny, a well estab",1,Big Bang Theory,76,14
1633,Leonard,7," She's gone, Sheldon. ",1,Big Bang Theory,22,3
1634,Sheldon,7, Well she could have said goodbye. ,1,Big Bang Theory,35,6
1635,Penny,7," Okay, I have a problem.",1,Big Bang Theory,24,5
1636,Sheldon,7," It's called carpal tunnel syndrome, and quite frankly you deserve it. ",1,Big Bang Theory,71,11
1637,Leonard,7, What's wrong?,1,Big Bang Theory,14,2
1638,Penny,7," Um, well, Howard and Christie are kind of hooking up in my bedroom. ",1,Big Bang Theory,69,13
1639,Leonard,7, Are you sure?,1,Big Bang Theory,14,3
1640,Penny,7," Look, I grew up on a farm, okay, from what I heard they're either having sex or Howard's caught in a milking machine. Do you mind if I stay here tonight?",1,Big Bang Theory,154,31
1641,Leonard,7," No, take the couch, or my bed, I just got new pillows, hypo-allergenics. ",1,Big Bang Theory,74,13
1642,Penny,7," Uh, the couch is good.",1,Big Bang Theory,23,5
1643,Sheldon,7," Hold that thought, Leonard, a moment.",1,Big Bang Theory,38,6
1644,Leonard,7," Let me guess, you have a problem with this.",1,Big Bang Theory,44,9
1645,Sheldon,7, Where do I begin? ,1,Big Bang Theory,19,4
1646,Leonard,7," It's up to you, crazy person's choice. ",1,Big Bang Theory,40,7
1647,Sheldon,7," Well first, we don't have house guests, frankly if I could afford the rent I'd ask you to leave. ",1,Big Bang Theory,98,19
1648,Leonard,7," Your friendship means a lot to me as well, what else? ",1,Big Bang Theory,55,11
1649,Sheldon,7," Well, our earthquake supplies, we have a two day, two man kit.",1,Big Bang Theory,63,12
1650,Leonard,7, So? ,1,Big Bang Theory,5,1
1651,Sheldon,7," So, if there is an earthquake and the three of us are trapped here, we could be out of food by tomorrow afternoon. ",1,Big Bang Theory,116,23
1652,Leonard,7," I'm sorry, are you suggesting that if we let Penny stay we might succumb to cannibalism?",1,Big Bang Theory,89,16
1653,Sheldon,7, No-one ever thinks it will happen until it does. ,1,Big Bang Theory,50,9
1654,Leonard,7," Penny, if you promise not to chew the flesh off our bones while we sleep, you can stay. ",1,Big Bang Theory,89,18
1655,Penny,7, Hu.. what?,1,Big Bang Theory,11,2
1656,Sheldon,7," He's engaging in reductio-ad-absurdum. It's the logical fallacy of extending someone's argument to ridiculous proportions and then criticising the result, and I do not appreciate it. ",1,Big Bang Theory,184,26
1657,Leonard,7, I'll get you a blanket and a pillow. ,1,Big Bang Theory,38,8
1658,Penny,7, How am I supposed to plan my bodily functions?,1,Big Bang Theory,47,9
1659,Sheldon,7, I suggest no liquids after 11pm. ,1,Big Bang Theory,34,6
1660,Leonard,7, Here you go.,1,Big Bang Theory,13,3
1661,Penny,7, Thanks Leonard. ,1,Big Bang Theory,17,2
1662,Sheldon,7," Hmmph, wrong. ",1,Big Bang Theory,15,2
1663,Penny,7, I'm listening.,1,Big Bang Theory,15,2
1664,Sheldon,7, Your head goes on the other end.,1,Big Bang Theory,33,7
1665,Penny,7, Why? ,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
1666,Sheldon,7," It's culturally universal, a bed, even a temporary bed, is always oriented with the headboard away from the door. It serves the ancient imperative of protecting oneself against marauders.",1,Big Bang Theory,188,29
1667,Penny,7, I'll risk it.,1,Big Bang Theory,14,3
1668,Sheldon,7, Hm! ,1,Big Bang Theory,5,1
1669,Penny,7, Anything else I should know.,1,Big Bang Theory,29,5
1670,Sheldon,7, Yes. If you use my toothbrush I'll jump out that window. Please don't come to my funeral. Have a good night. ,1,Big Bang Theory,110,21
1671,Leonard,7, Sorry about that.,1,Big Bang Theory,18,3
1672,Penny,7, That's okay. ,1,Big Bang Theory,14,2
1673,Leonard,7," FYI, his toothbrush is the red one in the plexiglass case under the UV light. ",1,Big Bang Theory,79,15
1674,Penny,7, Got it.,1,Big Bang Theory,8,2
1675,Leonard,7," Well, sleep tight.",1,Big Bang Theory,19,3
1676,Penny,7, Thanks. ,1,Big Bang Theory,9,1
1677,Leonard,7," Funny expression, sleep tight. It refers to the early construction of beds which featured a mattress suspended on interlocking ropes which would occasionally sleep tight. ",1,Big Bang Theory,172,25
1679,Leonard,7, What are you doing? ,1,Big Bang Theory,21,4
1680,Leonard,7, Penny's still sleeping.,1,Big Bang Theory,24,3
1681,Leonard,7," I know, I know, look, you have a TV in your room, why don't you just have breakfast in bed? ",1,Big Bang Theory,93,20
1682,Sheldon,7, Because I am neither an invalid nor a woman celebrating Mother's Day. ,1,Big Bang Theory,71,12
1683,Penny,7," Uh, what time is it?",1,Big Bang Theory,21,5
1684,Penny,7, I slept all day?,1,Big Bang Theory,17,4
1685,Penny,7, What the hell is your problem?,1,Big Bang Theory,31,6
1686,Sheldon,7," Okay, this cereal has lost all its molecular integrity, I now have a bowl of shredded wheat paste.",1,Big Bang Theory,99,18
1687,Howard,7," Ola, nerd-migos. ",1,Big Bang Theory,18,2
1688,Penny,7, Why do you people hate sleep? Are you wearing my robe?,1,Big Bang Theory,55,11
1689,Howard,7," Oh, yeah, sorry, I'll have it cleaned.",1,Big Bang Theory,39,7
1690,Penny,7," That's okay, keep it. Where's Christie.",1,Big Bang Theory,40,6
1691,Howard,7," In the shower. Oh, by the way, where did you get that loofah mitt, yours reaches places that mine just won't.",1,Big Bang Theory,110,21
1692,Penny,7, Y-you used my loofah?,1,Big Bang Theory,22,4
1693,Howard,7, More precisely we used your loofah. I exfoliated her brains out! ,1,Big Bang Theory,66,11
1694,Penny,7, You can keep that too.,1,Big Bang Theory,23,5
1695,Howard,7," Ah, well then we'll probably need to talk about your stuffed bear collection.",1,Big Bang Theory,78,13
1697,Howard,7, In here my lady.,1,Big Bang Theory,17,4
1699,Howard,7, chka-chka-chka-chka-chka-chka-chka .,1,Big Bang Theory,37,2
1700,Sheldon,7, Well there's one beloved children's book I'll never read again.,1,Big Bang Theory,64,10
1702,Leonard,7, Leonard. ,1,Big Bang Theory,10,1
1703,Sheldon,7, I'm Sheldon.,1,Big Bang Theory,13,2
1705,Penny,7," Uh, so Christie, what are your plans?",1,Big Bang Theory,38,7
1707,Penny,7," Yeah, no, I meant plans to find some place to live. Other than with me, not that I don't love having you, but it's a little crowded.",1,Big Bang Theory,133,27
1708,Leonard,7," Penny, you're always welcome to stay with us.",1,Big Bang Theory,46,8
1709,Sheldon,7," Oh, terrific, now we're running a cute little B&B.",1,Big Bang Theory,51,9
1710,Howard,7," Let me offer a little outside the box thinking here, why doesn't Christie stay with me.",1,Big Bang Theory,88,16
1711,Leonard,7, For one thing you live with your mother.,1,Big Bang Theory,41,8
1712,Howard,7," I do not, my mother lives with me. ",1,Big Bang Theory,36,8
1713,Sheldon,7," Well then, it's all settled, Christie will stay with Howard, Penny can go back to her apartment, and I'll watch the last 24 minutes of Doctor Who, although at this point it's more like Doctor Why Bother. ",1,Big Bang Theory,205,37
1714,Leonard,7, Sheldon you just can't dictate,1,Big Bang Theory,31,5
1715,Sheldon,7," No more talking, everybody go. ",1,Big Bang Theory,32,5
1716,Howard,7," So, what do you say, you wanna repair to Castle Wolowitz? ",1,Big Bang Theory,59,11
1718,Howard,7," I'm sorry, I should have mentioned this earlier, my last name is Wolowitz.",1,Big Bang Theory,75,13
1720,Sheldon,7, I imagine there aren't many kosher corn-huskers. ,1,Big Bang Theory,50,7
1722,Howard,7, Anything you want.,1,Big Bang Theory,19,3
1724,Howard,7, When they perfect human cloning I'm going to order twelve of those.,1,Big Bang Theory,68,12
1725,Leonard,7," Howard, can't you see she's using you?",1,Big Bang Theory,39,7
1726,Howard,7," Who cares, last night she pulled off her blouse and I wept!",1,Big Bang Theory,60,12
1727,Penny,7," Look, Howard, I know her, okay, she'll have sex with anyone as long as they keep buying her things. ",1,Big Bang Theory,101,19
1728,Howard,7, Really?,1,Big Bang Theory,8,1
1729,Penny,7, Yeah.,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
1730,Howard,7," Yay! If you'll excuse me, I have some Bar-Mizvah bonds to cash. ",1,Big Bang Theory,65,12
1732,Sheldon,7," I'm sorry, we cannot do this without Wolowitz.",1,Big Bang Theory,47,8
1733,Leonard,7, We can't order Chinese food without Wolowitz?,1,Big Bang Theory,46,7
1734,Sheldon,7," Let me walk you through it, our standard is, the steamed dumpling appetizer, General So's chicken, beef with broccoli, shrimp with lobster sauce and vegetable lo-main. Do you see the problem?",1,Big Bang Theory,192,31
1735,Leonard,7, I see a problem. ,1,Big Bang Theory,18,4
1736,Sheldon,7, Our entire order is predicated on four dumplings and four entrees divided among four people. ,1,Big Bang Theory,94,15
1737,Leonard,7," So, we'll just order three entrees.",1,Big Bang Theory,36,6
1738,Sheldon,7," Fine, what do you want to eliminate, and who gets the extra dumpling. ",1,Big Bang Theory,71,13
1739,Raj,7, We could cut it into thirds. ,1,Big Bang Theory,30,6
1740,Sheldon,7," Then it is no longer a dumpling, once you cut it open it is at best a very small open faced sandwich. ",1,Big Bang Theory,103,22
1742,Sheldon,7," He's putting his needs ahead of the collective good.  Where he comes from, that's punishable by death.",1,Big Bang Theory,103,17
1744,Leonard,7," Can we get an order of dumplings, but with three instead of four.",1,Big Bang Theory,66,13
1746,Leonard,7," This isn't a substitution, it's a reduction. ",1,Big Bang Theory,46,7
1748,Leonard,7," Fine, bring us three orders of dumplings, that's twelve, we'll each have four. ",1,Big Bang Theory,80,13
1749,Raj,7, That works. ,1,Big Bang Theory,13,2
1750,Sheldon,7," No, if we fill up on dumplings we'll need to eliminate another entree. ",1,Big Bang Theory,72,13
1752,Leonard,7," If we have extra, we'll just take the leftovers home.",1,Big Bang Theory,54,10
1753,Sheldon,7," And divide it how, I'm telling you we cannot do this without Wolowitz. ",1,Big Bang Theory,72,13
1754,Leonard,7," Wolowitz is with his new girlfriend, if you had let me invite Penny then you would have had your fourth.",1,Big Bang Theory,105,20
1755,Sheldon,7," Have you seen Penny eat Chinese food, she uses a fork, and she double dips her egg rolls. ",1,Big Bang Theory,91,18
1756,Leonard,7, We don't order egg rolls.,1,Big Bang Theory,26,5
1757,Sheldon,7," Exactly, but we'd have to if she was here.",1,Big Bang Theory,43,9
1758,Raj,7," Can we please make a decision, not only are there children starving in India, there's an Indian starving right here. ",1,Big Bang Theory,118,20
1759,Leonard,7," Here's an idea, why don't we just go out for Indian food.",1,Big Bang Theory,58,12
1760,Sheldon,7, No.,1,Big Bang Theory,4,1
1761,Raj,7, Uurgh.,1,Big Bang Theory,7,1
1763,Sheldon,7, I'll know. ,1,Big Bang Theory,12,2
1765,Raj,7, How about soup?,1,Big Bang Theory,16,3
1766,Leonard,7," Yeah, we can always divide soup.",1,Big Bang Theory,33,6
1767,Sheldon,7, What about the won-tons?,1,Big Bang Theory,25,4
1769,Penny,7," Oh, hey guys, what's up?",1,Big Bang Theory,25,5
1770,Sheldon,7, It's Halo night.,1,Big Bang Theory,17,3
1771,Penny,7, Yeah. Okay. So?,1,Big Bang Theory,16,3
1772,Leonard,7," Well, with Wolowitz spending all of his time with your friend Christie, ",1,Big Bang Theory,73,12
1773,Penny,7, She's not my friend. Friends do not get their friends care bears all sweaty. ,1,Big Bang Theory,78,14
1774,Leonard,7," Right, anyway, uh, with Wolowitz occupied elsewhere, we had something we wanted to ask you. Sheldon?",1,Big Bang Theory,101,16
1775,Sheldon,7," Yes. Penny, we would very much appreciate it if you would be the fourth member of our Halo team. I don't think I need to tell you what an honour this is. ",1,Big Bang Theory,155,32
1776,Penny,7," Oh, that's so sweet. But I'm going out dancing with a girlfriend. ",1,Big Bang Theory,67,12
1777,Sheldon,7," You can't go out, it's Halo night. ",1,Big Bang Theory,36,7
1778,Penny,7," Well, for Penny it's dancing night. ",1,Big Bang Theory,37,6
1779,Sheldon,7, You go dancing every Wednesday.,1,Big Bang Theory,32,5
1780,Penny,7, No.,1,Big Bang Theory,4,1
1781,Sheldon,7, Then it's not dancing night. ,1,Big Bang Theory,30,5
1782,Penny,7," Look, why don't I play with you guys tomorrow?",1,Big Bang Theory,47,9
1783,Sheldon,7," Tonight is Halo night, it's like talking to a wall. ",1,Big Bang Theory,53,10
1784,Penny,7," Alright, now Sheldon, you and I are about to have a problem. ",1,Big Bang Theory,62,12
1785,Leonard,7," Sheldon, remember, we role-played this.",1,Big Bang Theory,40,5
1786,Sheldon,7," Yes, but you didn't portray her as completely irrational.",1,Big Bang Theory,58,9
1787,Penny,7," Alright fellas, I gotta go. Good luck. ",1,Big Bang Theory,40,7
1788,Leonard,7, Maybe we should have asked if we could go dancing with her and her girlfriend. ,1,Big Bang Theory,80,15
1789,Sheldon,7," Okay, assuming we could dance, which we can't, there are three of us and two of them.",1,Big Bang Theory,86,17
1790,Leonard,7, So?,1,Big Bang Theory,4,1
1791,Sheldon,7," It's the Chinese restaurant all over again. I assure you that cutting a dumpling in thirds is child's play compared with three men, each attempting to dance with 67% of a woman.",1,Big Bang Theory,178,32
1792,Leonard,7," Aaah, for God's sake, Sheldon, you are driving me crazy. ",1,Big Bang Theory,58,10
1793,Sheldon,7," Your anger's not with me, sir, but with basic mathematics.",1,Big Bang Theory,59,10
1794,Leonard,7," No, I'm pretty sure my anger's with you.",1,Big Bang Theory,41,8
1795,Raj,7, What's happening to us? We're falling apart. ,1,Big Bang Theory,46,7
1796,Leonard,7, Who are you calling?,1,Big Bang Theory,21,4
1797,Sheldon,7, The only man who can restore any semblance of balance to our universe.,1,Big Bang Theory,71,13
1798,Howard,7, Hi this is Howard Wolowitz.,1,Big Bang Theory,28,5
1800,Howard,7, We can't get to the phone right now because we're having sex.,1,Big Bang Theory,62,12
1802,Howard,7," No, I'm just kidding, I'll re-record it. ",1,Big Bang Theory,42,7
1804,Leonard,7," Sheldon, think this through, you're going to ask Howard to choose between sex and Halo.",1,Big Bang Theory,88,15
1805,Sheldon,7," No, I'm going to ask him to choose between sex and Halo 3. As far as I know, sex has not been upgraded to include high-def graphics and enhanced weapon systems. ",1,Big Bang Theory,162,31
1806,Leonard,7," You're right, all sex has is nudity, orgasms and human contact. ",1,Big Bang Theory,65,11
1807,Sheldon,7, My point.,1,Big Bang Theory,10,2
1810,Howard,7," Ladies, ladies, I'm sure there's a middle ground.",1,Big Bang Theory,50,8
1812,Howard,7," You girl's talk, I'm going to take my scooter out for a little spin. ",1,Big Bang Theory,70,14

1825,Howard,7," Sheldon, you got him in your sights, fire, he's charging his plasma rifle. ",1,Big Bang Theory,76,13
1826,Sheldon,7," I can't shoot now, I'm cloaking.",1,Big Bang Theory,33,6
1827,Leonard,7," Now, Raj, kill Sheldon.",1,Big Bang Theory,24,4
1828,Raj,7, I can't see him.,1,Big Bang Theory,17,4
1829,Sheldon,7," That's why the call it cloaking, dead man.",1,Big Bang Theory,43,8
1830,Leonard,7, Well then start throwing grenades.,1,Big Bang Theory,35,5
1831,Raj,7, I'm all out. ,1,Big Bang Theory,14,3
1832,Penny,7," Hi guys, my friends and I got tired of dancing, so we came over to have sex with you. ",1,Big Bang Theory,87,19
1833,Leonard,7," That will do, Raj, straight for the tank.",1,Big Bang Theory,42,8
1834,Sheldon,7, We said no tanks.,1,Big Bang Theory,18,4
1835,Raj,7, There are no rules in hell! ,1,Big Bang Theory,29,6

1837,Penny,7, Told yah! . ,1,Big Bang Theory,13,3
1838,Leonard,7," There's a sniper, use your rocket launcher. ",1,Big Bang Theory,45,7
1839,Raj,7," All I've got is a needler, and I'm all out of ammo. ",1,Big Bang Theory,53,12
1840,Sheldon,7, And now you're out of life. Why did you hit pause?,1,Big Bang Theory,51,11
1841,Leonard,7, I thought I heard something. ,1,Big Bang Theory,30,5
1842,Raj,7, What?,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
1843,Leonard,7," No, never mind, alright, go. ",1,Big Bang Theory,30,5
1845,Sheldon,8," Damn you, walletnook.com.",1,Big Bang Theory,26,3
1846,Leonard,8, Problem?,1,Big Bang Theory,9,1
1847,Sheldon,8," The online description was completely misleading, they said eight slots plus removable ID, to any rational person that would mean room for nine cards, but they don't tell you the removable ID takes up one slot, it's a nightmare. ",1,Big Bang Theory,230,39
1848,Leonard,8," Okay, now, do you really need the honorary Justice League of America membership card?",1,Big Bang Theory,86,14
1849,Sheldon,8, It's been in every wallet I've owned since I was five. ,1,Big Bang Theory,56,11
1850,Leonard,8, Why?,1,Big Bang Theory,5,1
1851,Sheldon,8, It says keep this on your person at all times.  It's right here under Batman's signature.,1,Big Bang Theory,90,16
1852,Raj,8, And this is Leonard and Sheldon's apartment. ,1,Big Bang Theory,46,7
1853,Howard,8, Guess whose parents just got broadband. ,1,Big Bang Theory,41,6
1854,Raj,8," May I present, live from New Delhi, Dr and Mrs V. M. Koothrappali. ",1,Big Bang Theory,68,13
1855,Leonard,8, Hi.,1,Big Bang Theory,4,1
1857,Raj,8, Sorry papa.,1,Big Bang Theory,12,2

1887,Raj,8, Spring wedding?,1,Big Bang Theory,16,2
1889,Raj,8," If you don't want to meddle, then why are you meddling.",1,Big Bang Theory,56,11
1890,Sheldon,8," If I may, your parents probably don't consider this meddling, while arranged marriages are no longer the norm, Indian parents continue to have a greater than average involvement in their children's lives.",1,Big Bang Theory,205,32
1891,Raj,8, Why are you telling me about my own culture? ,1,Big Bang Theory,46,9
1892,Sheldon,8, You seemed confused.,1,Big Bang Theory,21,3
1893,Raj,8," Sorry, Mommy, Papa, but with all due respect I really can't go through",1,Big Bang Theory,71,13
1896,Raj,8, I don't believe it.,1,Big Bang Theory,20,4
1897,Howard,8," Neither do I. Doogie Howser's been off the air for like, twenty years. ",1,Big Bang Theory,72,13
1898,Leonard,8," Actually, I read somewhere that it's one of the most popular programmes in India. ",1,Big Bang Theory,83,14
1899,Sheldon,8, It might speak to a cultural aspiration to have one's children enter the medical profession. ,1,Big Bang Theory,94,15
1900,Leonard,8, I bet you're right.,1,Big Bang Theory,20,4
1901,Howard,8, I bet they love Scrubs.,1,Big Bang Theory,24,5
1902,Sheldon,8, What's not to love?,1,Big Bang Theory,20,4
1903,Raj,8," Excuse me, hello? My parents are trying to marry me off to a total stranger, what am I going to do?",1,Big Bang Theory,100,21
1904,Sheldon,8, I suggest you go through with it.,1,Big Bang Theory,34,7
1905,Raj,8, What?,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
1906,Sheldon,8," Romantic love as the basis for marriage has only existed since the nineteenth century. Up until then, arranged marriages were the norm, and it served society quite well.",1,Big Bang Theory,170,28
1907,Howard,8, It's the entire premise of Fiddler on the Roof.,1,Big Bang Theory,48,9
1908,Leonard,8," I'm not a big fan of musicals, but I love that show. ",1,Big Bang Theory,54,12
1909,Howard,8," Me too. Of course, it speaks to me culturally. ",1,Big Bang Theory,48,9
1910,Sheldon,8," Understandable, but there's a universality to that story which transcends ethnicity.",1,Big Bang Theory,85,11
1911,Howard,8, Let's not forget it's got some really catchy tunes.,1,Big Bang Theory,52,9
1913,Raj,8," Okay, I know what I'm going to do.",1,Big Bang Theory,35,8
1914,Leonard,8, What? ,1,Big Bang Theory,7,1
1915,Raj,8, Find new friends. ,1,Big Bang Theory,19,3
1916,Howard,8, So who wants to rent Fiddler?,1,Big Bang Theory,30,6
1917,Sheldon,8," No need, we have the special edition. ",1,Big Bang Theory,39,7
1918,Leonard,8," Well, maybe we are like Haroun and Tanweer. ",1,Big Bang Theory,45,8
1920,Sheldon,8," This is Dr Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I need to cancel my membership to the Planetarium. Yeah, well I'm sorry too, but there's just no room for you in my wallet. Yeah, I understand, but it was between you and the Museum of Natural History and, frankly, you don't have dinosaurs. Well I'll miss you too, bye bye. Okay, I know you're texting about me, and I'd really like you to stop.",1,Big Bang Theory,378,71
1921,Raj,8," Oh dear, I am rightly and truly screwed. ",1,Big Bang Theory,42,8
1922,Leonard,8," Hey, I thought you were finding new friends.",1,Big Bang Theory,45,8
1923,Raj,8," I've got some feelers out. In the meantime, listen to this.",1,Big Bang Theory,60,11
1925,Raj,8, Can you believe how pushy she is?,1,Big Bang Theory,34,7
1926,Leonard,8, So don't call her.,1,Big Bang Theory,19,4
1927,Raj,8," If I don't call her, I won't hear the end of it from my parents.",1,Big Bang Theory,65,15
1928,Leonard,8, So call her. ,1,Big Bang Theory,14,3
1929,Raj,8," How can I call her, you know I can't talk to women. ",1,Big Bang Theory,53,12
1930,Leonard,8," I'm done, anybody else?",1,Big Bang Theory,24,4
1931,Howard,8, Give me the phone.,1,Big Bang Theory,19,4
1932,Raj,8, Why?,1,Big Bang Theory,5,1
1933,Howard,8, Just give it to me. ,1,Big Bang Theory,21,5
1934,Raj,8, What are you doing?,1,Big Bang Theory,20,4
1935,Howard,8," Don't worry, you'll thank me.  Hello Lalita, Raj Koothrappali.  Yes it is good to talk to you too. So, what are you wearing. Oh, not important, so, anyhow, when would you like to meet. Friday works for me. And I call you with the time and place, but in the meantime, keep it real babe.  You may now thank me. ",1,Big Bang Theory,310,60
1936,Raj,8," For what, making me sound like a Simpsons character? ",1,Big Bang Theory,54,9
1937,Howard,8," Fine, next time make your own date.",1,Big Bang Theory,36,7
1938,Raj,8, I didn't want to make this one.,1,Big Bang Theory,32,7
1939,Leonard,8," Look on the bright side, she might turn out to be a nice, beautiful girl. ",1,Big Bang Theory,75,15
1940,Raj,8," Great, then we'll get married, I won't be able to talk to her, and we'll spend the rest of our lives in total silence. ",1,Big Bang Theory,120,24
1941,Howard,8, Worked for my parents. ,1,Big Bang Theory,24,4
1942,Penny,8, Hi guys.,1,Big Bang Theory,9,2
1943,Leonard,8," Oh, hey. ",1,Big Bang Theory,10,2
1944,Penny,8, I need some guinea pigs.,1,Big Bang Theory,25,5
1945,Sheldon,8," Okay, there's a lab animal supply company in Reseda you could try, but if your research is going to have human applications may I suggest white mice instead, their brain chemistry is far closer to ours. ",1,Big Bang Theory,204,36
1946,Penny,8," I swear to God, Sheldon, one day I'm going to get the hang of talking to you. ",1,Big Bang Theory,79,17
1947,Leonard,8, His mom's been saying that for years. What's up?,1,Big Bang Theory,49,9
1948,Penny,8," Well, I finally convinced the restaurant to give me a bar tending shift, so I need to practice making drinks.",1,Big Bang Theory,110,20
1949,Leonard,8," Oh, great, well the key to acquiring proficiency in any task is repetition.",1,Big Bang Theory,76,13
1950,Sheldon,8," With certain obvious exceptions. Suicide, for example. ",1,Big Bang Theory,56,7
1951,Penny,8," So Leonard, how about it?",1,Big Bang Theory,26,5
1952,Leonard,8," Look, Penny, we'd love to help you, but Raj is going through some stuff right now. And besides, he doesn't drink, so  Really? Um, Raj is going through some stuff right now and he'd like to take up drinking. ",1,Big Bang Theory,208,39
1954,Penny,8," Okay, here you go, Leonard, one tequila sunrise. ",1,Big Bang Theory,50,8
1955,Leonard,8, Thank you. This drink is a wonderful example of how liquids with different specific gravities interact in a cylindrical container. Thank you. ,1,Big Bang Theory,143,22
1956,Penny,8," Okay, Raj, what'll it be?  ",1,Big Bang Theory,28,5
1957,Leonard,8, Whatever you recommend.,1,Big Bang Theory,24,3
1958,Penny,8," Uh, how about a grasshopper. I make a mean grasshopper. Okay? Good. Coming up. Sheldon, what are you going to have?",1,Big Bang Theory,116,21
1959,Sheldon,8, I'll have a diet coke.,1,Big Bang Theory,23,5
1960,Penny,8," Okay, can you please order a cocktail, I need to practice mixing drinks.",1,Big Bang Theory,73,13
1961,Sheldon,8, Fine. I'll have a virgin cuba libre. ,1,Big Bang Theory,38,7
1962,Penny,8," That's, um, rum and coke without the rum.",1,Big Bang Theory,42,8
1963,Sheldon,8," Yes, ",1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
1964,Penny,8, So coke.,1,Big Bang Theory,9,2
1965,Sheldon,8, Yes. And would you make it diet? ,1,Big Bang Theory,34,7
1966,Penny,8, There's a can in the fridge. ,1,Big Bang Theory,30,6
1967,Sheldon,8, A cuba libre traditionally comes in a tall glass with a lime wedge.,1,Big Bang Theory,68,13
1968,Penny,8, Then swim to Cuba.,1,Big Bang Theory,19,4
1969,Sheldon,8, Bartenders are supposed to have people skills. ,1,Big Bang Theory,48,7
1970,Penny,8," Okay, Raj, here you go. Alright, who's next?",1,Big Bang Theory,45,8
1971,Howard,8, I'd like to try a slippery nipple. ,1,Big Bang Theory,36,7
1972,Penny,8," Okay, you're cut off. Anybody need a refill?",1,Big Bang Theory,45,8
1973,Raj,8," Where did my life go, Penny? One day I'm a carefree batchelor, and the next I'm married and driving a minivan to peewee cricket matches in suburban New Delhi. ",1,Big Bang Theory,160,29
1974,Penny,8, A are you talking to me?,1,Big Bang Theory,25,6
1975,Raj,8," Is there another Penny here? I had such plans. I had dreams. I was going to be the Indira Gandhi of particle astro-physics. But with a penis, of course. ",1,Big Bang Theory,154,29
1976,Leonard,8, It's amazing.,1,Big Bang Theory,14,2
1977,Raj,8," Ever since I was a little boy my father wanted me to be a gynaecologist like him. How can I be a gynaecologist, I can barely look a woman in the eye. You know what, I'm not going to let my parents control my future any longer, it's time for a showdown. Somebody give me a computer with a webcam. ",1,Big Bang Theory,297,60
1978,Penny,8," Okay, sweetie, I think that's the grasshopper talking. ",1,Big Bang Theory,56,8
1979,Raj,8, And it's about to tell my parents that I'm not riding an elephant down the aisle with Lalita Gupta. ,1,Big Bang Theory,101,19
1980,Penny,8," Okay, calm down, no-one can make you get married. Why don't you just meet this girl and, see what happens.",1,Big Bang Theory,107,20
1981,Raj,8," Haven't you been listening to me, I cannot talk to women.",1,Big Bang Theory,58,11
1982,Leonard,8, Um Raj.,1,Big Bang Theory,8,2
1983,Howard,8," No, no, let's see how long it takes him.",1,Big Bang Theory,41,9
1984,Penny,8," Um, Raj, honey, you say you can't talk to women but you've been talking to me.",1,Big Bang Theory,79,16
1985,Sheldon,8, And now we'll never know. ,1,Big Bang Theory,27,5
1986,Raj,8," You're right. I I am talking to you. Hello Penny, how are you?",1,Big Bang Theory,63,13
1987,Penny,8, I'm fine.,1,Big Bang Theory,10,2
1988,Raj,8," Okay, now I just need to make sure I have a Lalita before I meet the grasshopper. It's a sweet green miracle. ",1,Big Bang Theory,111,22
1989,Penny,8," Okay, if you're going to drink on this date just promise me you won't overdo it. ",1,Big Bang Theory,82,16
1990,Raj,8, Overdo what? Happiness? Freedom? This warm glow inside of me that promises everything is going to be all hunky donkey?,1,Big Bang Theory,119,20
1991,Penny,8," Yeah, that. Uh, why don't you bring her to my restaurant when I'm tending the bar so I can keep an eye on you?",1,Big Bang Theory,111,24
1992,Raj,8, Okay.,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
1993,Leonard,8," Wait a minute, what's the plan here? Let's say he meets her and he likes her and they get married, what's he going to do, stay drunk for the rest of his life?",1,Big Bang Theory,159,33
1994,Howard,8, Worked for my parents. ,1,Big Bang Theory,24,4
1996,Raj,8, I can't believe I'm sitting here next to little Lalita Gupta. ,1,Big Bang Theory,63,11
1998,Raj,8," Little Lalita. That's kind of fun to say. Little Lalita, Little Lalita, Little Lalita, you should try it.",1,Big Bang Theory,106,18
2000,Raj,8," You have lost so much weight! That must have been difficult for you because you were so, so fat! Do you remember?",1,Big Bang Theory,114,22
2002,Raj,8, Of course you do. Who could forget being that fat? ,1,Big Bang Theory,52,10
2004,Raj,8," So you're a dental student? Hmm, are you aware that dentists have an extremely high suicide rate? Not as high as, say, air traffic controllers, but then there are far more dentists than air traffic controllers, so in pure numbers you're still winning. ",1,Big Bang Theory,253,43
2006,Leonard,8, You have a drink that'll make him less obnoxious?,1,Big Bang Theory,50,9
2007,Penny,8, Drinks do not work that way. ,1,Big Bang Theory,30,6
2008,Howard,8," I'd say he was doing fine, look at her, last girl my mom set me up with had a moustache and a vestigial tail. ",1,Big Bang Theory,111,24
2009,Sheldon,8, Sorry I'm late.,1,Big Bang Theory,16,3
2010,Leonard,8, What happened?,1,Big Bang Theory,15,2
2011,Sheldon,8," Nothing, I just really didn't want to come. Virgin diet cuba libre please.",1,Big Bang Theory,75,13
2012,Penny,8, Okay.,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
2013,Sheldon,8," In a tall glass, with a lime wedge.",1,Big Bang Theory,36,8
2014,Penny,8," Oh, I'll wedge it right in there. ",1,Big Bang Theory,35,7
2015,Sheldon,8," So, how's Koothrappali d. oh my Lord.",1,Big Bang Theory,38,7
2016,Leonard,8, What?,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
2017,Sheldon,8, That's Princess Punchali. ,1,Big Bang Theory,27,3
2018,Leonard,8, I'm pretty sure her name's Lalita.,1,Big Bang Theory,35,6
2019,Sheldon,8," No, no, Princess Punchali from The Monkey and the Princess. ",1,Big Bang Theory,61,10
2020,Howard,8," Oh, yeah, I tried to watch that online, but they wanted a credit card. ",1,Big Bang Theory,72,14
2021,Sheldon,8, It's a children's story.,1,Big Bang Theory,25,4
2022,Howard,8," Oh, no it isn't. ",1,Big Bang Theory,18,4
2023,Sheldon,8," When I was a little boy and got sick, which was most of the time, my mother would read it to me. It's about an Indian princess who befriends a monkey, who was mocked by all the other monkeys because he was different. For some reason I related to it quite strongly. ",1,Big Bang Theory,266,52
2024,Penny,8, I know the reason. ,1,Big Bang Theory,20,4
2025,Leonard,8," We all know the reason. Sheldon, what are you getting at?",1,Big Bang Theory,58,11
2026,Sheldon,8, That woman looks exactly like the pictures of Princess Punchali in the book. How often does one see a beloved fictional character come to life?,1,Big Bang Theory,144,25
2027,Howard,8," Every year at Comic Con. Every day at Disneyland you can hire Snow White to come to your house. Course they prefer it if you have a kid, but ",1,Big Bang Theory,142,29
2028,Raj,8," Hey guys. This is Lalita Gupta, Lalita this is Leonard and Sheldon and Howard and Penny. Isn't it great, she isn't fat any more! ",1,Big Bang Theory,130,24
2029,Sheldon,8," Forgive me your highness, for I am but a monkey, and it is in my nature to climb. I did not mean to gaze upon you as you comb your hair.",1,Big Bang Theory,137,31
2031,Sheldon,8, You are the living embodiment of the beautiful Princess Punchali. ,1,Big Bang Theory,67,10
2033,Sheldon,8, A beloved character from an Indian folk tale. ,1,Big Bang Theory,47,8
2035,Sheldon,8, You Indian.,1,Big Bang Theory,12,2
2037,Sheldon,8, The resemblance is remarkable. I can practically smell the lotus blossoms woven into your ebony hair. ,1,Big Bang Theory,103,16
2039,Sheldon,8, I shower twice a day and wash my hands as often as I can. ,1,Big Bang Theory,59,14
2041,Raj,8," But you're a dentist, he's nuts. ",1,Big Bang Theory,34,6
2043,Sheldon,8," It was said that the Gods fashioned her eyes out of the stars, and that roses were ashamed to bloom in the presence of her ruby lips. ",1,Big Bang Theory,135,27
2045,Raj,8, Back off Sheldon. ,1,Big Bang Theory,19,3
2046,Sheldon,8, What?,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
2047,Raj,8, If you do not stop hitting on my lady you will feel the full extent of my wrath.,1,Big Bang Theory,81,18
2048,Sheldon,8, I'm not hitting on her.,1,Big Bang Theory,24,5
2050,Howard,8, And you have no wrath. ,1,Big Bang Theory,24,5
2051,Raj,8, You are my lady. Our parents said so. We are for all intents and purposes one hundred percent hooked up.,1,Big Bang Theory,105,20
2053,Sheldon,8, Exactly the kind of spirit with which Princess Punchali led the monkeys to freedom. ,1,Big Bang Theory,85,14
2054,Raj,8," Oh, screw Princess Punchali.",1,Big Bang Theory,29,4
2056,Raj,8, But you're not Princess Punchali.,1,Big Bang Theory,34,5
2057,Sheldon,8," Luckily for you, she could have you beheaded.",1,Big Bang Theory,46,8
2059,Sheldon,8, I could eat. ,1,Big Bang Theory,14,3
2061,Raj,8, What just happened?,1,Big Bang Theory,20,3
2062,Leonard,8, Beats the hell out of me. ,1,Big Bang Theory,27,6
2063,Howard,8," I'll tell you what just happened, I just learned how to pick up Indian chicks. ",1,Big Bang Theory,80,15
2067,Raj,8," Maybe you should keep your eye on the ball, Papa. ",1,Big Bang Theory,51,10
2069,Leonard,8," Doctor and Mrs Koothrappali, in all fairness, it wasn't entirely Raj's fault. ",1,Big Bang Theory,79,12
2071,Leonard,8," No, I'm Leonard. ",1,Big Bang Theory,18,3
2073,Raj,8," But he's right, Papa, listen to him.  You! You are the one who ruined everything! ",1,Big Bang Theory,83,15
2076,Raj,8," Go ahead, tell my parents why they won't have any grandchildren.",1,Big Bang Theory,65,11
2077,Sheldon,8," How would I know, do you have a low sperm count?",1,Big Bang Theory,49,11
2078,Raj,8, This has nothing to do with my sperm count.,1,Big Bang Theory,44,9
2080,Raj,8, Yes Mommy.,1,Big Bang Theory,11,2
2082,Raj,8," Can we please stop talking about my testicles? Sheldon, tell them what you did.",1,Big Bang Theory,80,14
2083,Sheldon,8, What did I do? ,1,Big Bang Theory,16,4
2084,Leonard,8, You left with his date. Friends don't do that to each other. ,1,Big Bang Theory,62,12
2085,Sheldon,8," Oh. Alright, noted. Sorry.",1,Big Bang Theory,27,4
2086,Raj,8, Sorry? That's all you can say is sorry?,1,Big Bang Theory,40,8
2087,Leonard,8," Take it, Raj. It's more than I've ever gotten. ",1,Big Bang Theory,48,9
2088,Sheldon,8, And may I point out she wouldn't have asked me to go with her if you hadn't been drunk and boring. ,1,Big Bang Theory,100,21
2090,Sheldon,8," And boring, her words. ",1,Big Bang Theory,24,4
2092,Raj,8, I'm not an alcoholic.,1,Big Bang Theory,22,4
2094,Raj,8," It was just this one time, Papa, I swear. ",1,Big Bang Theory,43,9
2098,Raj,8," But Papa, please.",1,Big Bang Theory,18,3
2100,Raj,8, I have to go. ,1,Big Bang Theory,15,4
2102,Raj,8, Please wait until I get into the hall. ,1,Big Bang Theory,40,8
2103,Sheldon,8," Okay, well, good night.",1,Big Bang Theory,24,4
2104,Leonard,8, Hold on. What happened with you and Lalita?,1,Big Bang Theory,44,8
2105,Sheldon,8," We ate. She lectured me on the link between gum disease and heart attacks, nothing I didn't already know, and I came home. ",1,Big Bang Theory,124,23
2106,Leonard,8, So you're not going to see her again?,1,Big Bang Theory,38,8
2107,Sheldon,8, Why would I see her again? I already have a dentist. ,1,Big Bang Theory,54,11
2108,Leonard,8, I wonder who's going to tell his parents they're not having grandchildren. ,1,Big Bang Theory,76,12
2110,Leonard,8," I don't believe it, what's gotten into him? ",1,Big Bang Theory,45,8
2111,Penny,8," Oh, maybe a couple of virgin cuba libres that turned out to be kind of slutty. ",1,Big Bang Theory,80,16
2112,Leonard,8, You didn't?,1,Big Bang Theory,12,2
2113,Penny,8," Hey, you do your experiments, I do mine. ",1,Big Bang Theory,42,8
2115,Leonard,9," Okay, the X10s are online.",1,Big Bang Theory,27,5
2116,Howard,9," Gentlemen, I am now about to send a signal from this laptop through our local ISP, racing down fibre-optic cable at the speed of light to San Francisco, bouncing off a satellite in geosynchronous orbit to Lisbon, Portugal, where the data packets will be handed off to submerged transatlantic cables terminating in Halifax, Nova-Scotia, and transferred across the continent via microwave relays back to our ISP and the X10 receiver attached to this  lamp. . ",1,Big Bang Theory,458,75
2117,Sheldon,9," Look at me, look at me, I've got goosebumps. ",1,Big Bang Theory,46,9
2118,Howard,9, Are we ready on the stereo? ,1,Big Bang Theory,29,6
2119,Raj,9, Go for stereo. ,1,Big Bang Theory,16,3
2120,Penny,9, Hey guys. ,1,Big Bang Theory,11,2
2122,Penny,9, It's a little loud.,1,Big Bang Theory,20,4
2123,Howard,9," No problem, turning it down.  San Francisco, Lisbon, Halifax  et voila. ",1,Big Bang Theory,73,11
2124,Penny,9," Okay, thanks.",1,Big Bang Theory,14,2
2125,Leonard,9," Hang on, hang on, do you not realise what we just did.",1,Big Bang Theory,55,12
2126,Penny,9," Yeah, you turned your stereo down with your laptop. ",1,Big Bang Theory,53,9
2127,Sheldon,9," No, we turned our stereo down by sending a signal around the world via the internet. ",1,Big Bang Theory,86,16
2128,Penny,9," Oh. You know you can just get one of those universal remotes at Radio Shack, they're really cheap.",1,Big Bang Theory,99,18
2129,Leonard,9," No, no, no, you don't get it, um, Howard, enable public access. ",1,Big Bang Theory,65,12
2130,Howard,9, Public access enabled. ,1,Big Bang Theory,24,3
2131,Penny,9," Boy, that's brilliant, but I'll see you.",1,Big Bang Theory,41,7
2132,Leonard,9," No, hang on, hang on.  See! ",1,Big Bang Theory,29,6
2133,Penny,9, No.,1,Big Bang Theory,4,1
2134,Sheldon,9," Someone in Sezchuan province, China is using his computer to turn our lights on and off. ",1,Big Bang Theory,90,16
2135,Penny,9," Huh, well that's handy. Um, here's a question, why? ",1,Big Bang Theory,53,9
2137,Sheldon,9, They found the remote controlled cars.,1,Big Bang Theory,39,6
2138,Penny,9," Well, wait, wait, what's on top of them. ",1,Big Bang Theory,42,8
2139,Leonard,9," Wireless webcams, wave hello. ",1,Big Bang Theory,31,4
2140,Howard,9," The monster truck is out of Austin, Texas, and the blue Viper is being operated from suburban Tel Aviv. ",1,Big Bang Theory,105,19
2141,Sheldon,9, You may want to put on slacks. ,1,Big Bang Theory,32,7
2142,Penny,9," What?  Ew, stop it, no, leave me alone. ",1,Big Bang Theory,41,8
2143,Leonard,9, Who's running the red Corvette?,1,Big Bang Theory,32,5
2144,Howard,9, That would be me. ,1,Big Bang Theory,19,4
2146,Sheldon,9," You know, in the future, when we're disembodied brains in jars, we're going to look back on this as eight hours well wasted. ",1,Big Bang Theory,126,23
2147,Raj,9, I don't want to be in a jar. I want my brain in an android body. Eight feet tall and ripped. ,1,Big Bang Theory,94,21
2148,Howard,9, I'm with you. I just have to make sure if I'm a synthetic human I'd still be Jewish. I promised my mother. ,1,Big Bang Theory,108,22
2149,Raj,9, I suppose you could have your android penis circumcised. But that's something your Rabbi would have to discuss with the manufacturers. ,1,Big Bang Theory,136,21
2150,Sheldon,9, Not to mention you'd have to power down on Saturdays. ,1,Big Bang Theory,55,10
2151,Leonard,9," Sheldon, why is this letter in the trash? ",1,Big Bang Theory,43,8
2152,Sheldon,9," Well, there's always the possibility that a trash can spontaneously formed around the letter, but Occam's Razor would suggest that someone threw it out. ",1,Big Bang Theory,154,24
2153,Leonard,9, It's from the Institute for Experimental Physics. They want us to present our paper on the properties of super solids at the topical conference on Bowes-Einstein condensates. ,1,Big Bang Theory,176,27
2154,Sheldon,9, I know. I read it before I threw it out. ,1,Big Bang Theory,42,10
2155,Leonard,9," Okay if I may drill down to the bedrock of my question, why did you throw it out.",1,Big Bang Theory,82,18
2156,Sheldon,9," Because I have no interest in standing in the Rose Room of the Pasadena Marriott in front of a group of judgemental strangers, who wouldn't recognise true genius if it were standing in front of them giving a speech. Which, if I were there, it would be. ",1,Big Bang Theory,254,47
2157,Howard,9," I don't know, Sheldon, those topical conferences on Bowes-Einstein condensates parties are legendary. ",1,Big Bang Theory,103,13
2158,Leonard,9, Forget the parties.,1,Big Bang Theory,20,3
2159,Howard,9, Forget the parties? What a nerd. ,1,Big Bang Theory,34,6
2160,Leonard,9, Are there any other honours I've gotten that I don't know about? Did UPS drop off a Nobel Prize with my name on it?,1,Big Bang Theory,116,24
2161,Sheldon,9," Leonard, please don't take this the wrong way, but the day you win a Nobel Prize, is the day I begin my research on the drag co-efficient of tassles on flying carpets. ",1,Big Bang Theory,169,32
2162,Raj,9, Hoo-hoo-hoo. The only thing missing from that insult was â€œyo mamma.â€ù ,1,Big Bang Theory,74,11
2163,Howard,9," I've got one, hey Leonard, your mamma's research methodology is so flawed.",1,Big Bang Theory,75,12
2164,Leonard,9," Shut up, Howard. Sheldon, we have to do this.",1,Big Bang Theory,46,9
2165,Sheldon,9," No we don't. We have to take in nourishment, expel waste, and inhale enough oxygen to keep ourselves from dying, everything else is optional. ",1,Big Bang Theory,143,24
2166,Leonard,9," Okay, let me put it this way, I'm doing it.",1,Big Bang Theory,44,10
2167,Sheldon,9, You can't. I'm the lead author. ,1,Big Bang Theory,33,6
2168,Leonard,9," Oh, come on. The only reason you're the lead author is because we went alphabetically. ",1,Big Bang Theory,88,15
2169,Sheldon,9," I let you think we went alphabetically to spare you the humiliation of dealing with the fact that it was my idea. Not to put too fine a point on it, but I was throwing you a bone. You're welcome. ",1,Big Bang Theory,197,40
2170,Leonard,9," Excuse me, I designed the experiment that proved the hypothesis. ",1,Big Bang Theory,66,10
2171,Sheldon,9, It doesn't need proving. ,1,Big Bang Theory,26,4
2172,Leonard,9, So the entire scientific community is just supposed to take your word?,1,Big Bang Theory,71,12
2173,Sheldon,9," They're not supposed to, but they should. ",1,Big Bang Theory,43,7
2174,Leonard,9," Alright, I don't care what you say, I'm going to the conference and I'm presenting our findings. ",1,Big Bang Theory,98,17
2175,Sheldon,9, And I forbid it. ,1,Big Bang Theory,18,4
2176,Leonard,9, You forbid it?,1,Big Bang Theory,15,3
2177,Sheldon,9, If I'm not taking credit for our work then nobody is. ,1,Big Bang Theory,55,11
2178,Leonard,9," Oh, you admit that it's our work.",1,Big Bang Theory,34,7
2179,Sheldon,9," No, once again, I'm throwing you a bone. And once again, you are welcome. ",1,Big Bang Theory,75,14
2180,Leonard,9, Ah!,1,Big Bang Theory,4,1
2181,Howard,9, Oh no he dit'nt!,1,Big Bang Theory,17,4
2183,Penny,9," So, how's it going with Sheldon, are you guys still not talking to each other? ",1,Big Bang Theory,80,15
2184,Leonard,9," Not only is he still not talking to me, but there's this thing he does where he stares at you and tries to get your brain to explode. You know, like in the classic sci-fi movie Scanners?  You know, bzzz-pchew! Never mind. How about this one. It says, â€œI know my physics, but I'm still a fun guy!â€ù",1,Big Bang Theory,301,58
2185,Penny,9," Oh, hey, I didn't know they still made corduroy suits!",1,Big Bang Theory,55,10
2186,Leonard,9," They don't, that's why I saved this one. ",1,Big Bang Theory,42,8
2187,Penny,9," Okay, well, let's just see what else you have. Okay, here, take this, and this, and this, and these.",1,Big Bang Theory,101,19
2188,Leonard,9, Is this all stuff you want me to try on?,1,Big Bang Theory,41,10
2189,Penny,9," No, this is stuff I want you to throw out. ",1,Big Bang Theory,44,10
2190,Leonard,9, Oh.,1,Big Bang Theory,4,1
2191,Penny,9," Seriously, don't even give it to charity, you won't be helping anyone. What's this.",1,Big Bang Theory,84,14
2192,Leonard,9," Oh, that's the bottled city of Kandor. ",1,Big Bang Theory,40,7
2193,Penny,9, Uh-huh. ,1,Big Bang Theory,9,1
2194,Leonard,9," You see, Kandor was the capital city of the planet Krypton, it was miniaturised by Brainiac before Krypton exploded and then rescued by Superman. ",1,Big Bang Theory,147,24
2195,Penny,9," Oh, nice. ",1,Big Bang Theory,11,2
2196,Leonard,9, It's a lot cooler when girls aren't looking at it.,1,Big Bang Theory,51,10
2197,Penny,9," Here, why don't you put these on while I find a shirt and sport-coat to match. ",1,Big Bang Theory,80,16
2198,Leonard,9," Great, be right back.",1,Big Bang Theory,22,4
2199,Penny,9," Well, where you going, just put them on. ",1,Big Bang Theory,42,8
2200,Leonard,9, Here?,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
2201,Penny,9," Oh, are you shy? ",1,Big Bang Theory,18,4
2202,Leonard,9," No, I'm not shy.",1,Big Bang Theory,17,4
2203,Penny,9," Don't worry, I won't look. ",1,Big Bang Theory,28,5
2204,Leonard,9," I know you won't look, why would you look, there's nothing to see, well, not nothing.",1,Big Bang Theory,86,16
2205,Penny,9," Sweetie, put the pants on.",1,Big Bang Theory,27,5
2206,Leonard,9, Putting them on.,1,Big Bang Theory,17,3
2207,Penny,9," So, you know, isn't there maybe some way you and Sheldon could compromise on this whole presentation thing.",1,Big Bang Theory,108,18
2208,Leonard,9," No. No. Scientists do not compromise. Our minds are trained to synthesise facts and come to inarguable conclusions. Not to mention, Sheldon is batcrap crazy. ",1,Big Bang Theory,159,25
2209,Penny,9, What is this?,1,Big Bang Theory,14,3
2210,Leonard,9," Oh, careful. That's my original series Battlestar Galactica flight suit. ",1,Big Bang Theory,74,10
2211,Penny,9," Oh, why didn't you wear it at Halloween?",1,Big Bang Theory,41,8
2212,Leonard,9," Because it's not a costume, it's a flight suit. ",1,Big Bang Theory,49,9
2213,Penny,9," Okay, alright, moving on, oh, wow, a paisley shirt.",1,Big Bang Theory,52,9
2214,Leonard,9," Uh-huh, it goes with my corduroy suit. ",1,Big Bang Theory,40,7
2215,Penny,9," If you mean it should end up in the same place then, I agree. Is this your your only tie?",1,Big Bang Theory,90,20
2216,Leonard,9," Ah. Technically yes, but, if you'll notice, it's reversible. So it works as two. ",1,Big Bang Theory,82,14
2217,Penny,9," Oh, sweetie, I don't think it even works as one. Is this all your clothes?",1,Big Bang Theory,75,15
2218,Leonard,9, Yeah. Everything since the eighth grade. ,1,Big Bang Theory,42,6
2219,Penny,9, The the eighth grade?,1,Big Bang Theory,22,4
2220,Leonard,9, My last growth spurt. ,1,Big Bang Theory,23,4
2221,Penny,9," Okay, well, I guess we're back to the corduroy suit. ",1,Big Bang Theory,54,10
2222,Leonard,9, Great.,1,Big Bang Theory,7,1
2223,Penny,9," Yup.  I said no, put it down. ",1,Big Bang Theory,31,7
2225,Penny,9, Hey Sheldon! ,1,Big Bang Theory,14,2
2226,Sheldon,9, Hello Penny. ,1,Big Bang Theory,14,2
2227,Penny,9, Get anything good? ,1,Big Bang Theory,20,3
2228,Sheldon,9," Uh, just the latest copy of Applied Particle Physics Quarterly.",1,Big Bang Theory,64,10
2229,Penny,9," Oh, you know, that is so weird that yours came and mine didn't. . It was a joke.  Yup, tip your waitresses, I'm here all week. ",1,Big Bang Theory,128,26
2230,Sheldon,9," Penny, just to save you from further awkwardness know that I'm perfectly comfortable with the two of us climbing the stairs in silence. ",1,Big Bang Theory,137,23
2231,Penny,9," Oh yeah, me too. Zip it, lock it.  Put it in your pocket. So you and Leonard",1,Big Bang Theory,77,17
2232,Sheldon,9, Oh dear God! ,1,Big Bang Theory,14,3
2233,Penny,9," Little misunderstanding, huh. ",1,Big Bang Theory,31,3
2234,Sheldon,9, A little misunder. Galileo and the Pope had a little misunderstanding.,1,Big Bang Theory,71,11
2235,Penny,9," Anyway, I was talking to Leonard this morning and I think he feels really bad about it. ",1,Big Bang Theory,89,17
2236,Sheldon,9, Huh.,1,Big Bang Theory,5,1
2237,Penny,9, Well how do you feel?,1,Big Bang Theory,22,5
2238,Sheldon,9, I don't understand the question.,1,Big Bang Theory,33,5
2239,Penny,9, Well I'm just asking if it's difficult to be fighting with your best friend. ,1,Big Bang Theory,78,14
2240,Sheldon,9, Oh. I hadn't thought about it like that. I wonder if I've been experiencing physiological manifestations of some sort of unconscious emotional turmoil. ,1,Big Bang Theory,153,23
2241,Penny,9, Wait what? ,1,Big Bang Theory,12,2
2242,Sheldon,9, I couldn't poop this morning. ,1,Big Bang Theory,31,5
2243,Penny,9," You should just talk to him, I'm sure you guys can work this out. ",1,Big Bang Theory,67,14
2244,Sheldon,9, It's certainly preferable to my plan.,1,Big Bang Theory,38,6
2245,Penny,9, Which was? ,1,Big Bang Theory,12,2
2246,Sheldon,9, A powerful laxative. ,1,Big Bang Theory,22,3
2247,Penny,9," Okay, so you absolutely should talk to him, look, I know Leonard values you as a friend, and he told me himself that without your little idea there's no way he could have come up with this whole experiment thing.",1,Big Bang Theory,213,40
2248,Sheldon,9," Excuse me, little idea? ",1,Big Bang Theory,25,4
2249,Penny,9," Yeah, I mean he tried to explain it to me, I didn't really understand it but",1,Big Bang Theory,77,16
2250,Sheldon,9," Of course you didn't, he said little idea? ",1,Big Bang Theory,44,8
2251,Penny,9," Uh, well no, no, not in not in those words.",1,Big Bang Theory,44,10
2252,Sheldon,9," In what words then, exactly",1,Big Bang Theory,28,5
2253,Penny,9," Um, gee, the exact words aren't written it's more the spirit in which it's ",1,Big Bang Theory,76,14
2254,Sheldon,9, What did he say?,1,Big Bang Theory,17,4
2255,Penny,9, You had a lucky hunch. ,1,Big Bang Theory,24,5
2256,Leonard,9," Hey, Sheldon, I've been thinking, instead of arguing about this why don't.",1,Big Bang Theory,75,12
2257,Sheldon,9, Don't you ever speak to me again. ,1,Big Bang Theory,35,7
2258,Leonard,9, What . ,1,Big Bang Theory,8,2
2259,Penny,9," Uh, he . ",1,Big Bang Theory,10,3
2261,Leonard,9," Okay, I'm leaving for the conference. ",1,Big Bang Theory,39,6
2262,Sheldon,9, Have fun presenting my lucky hunch. ,1,Big Bang Theory,37,6
2263,Leonard,9, Sheldon I didn't mean it like that.,1,Big Bang Theory,36,7
2264,Sheldon,9, Then why did you say it.,1,Big Bang Theory,25,6
2265,Leonard,9," I don't know, I wasn't choosing my",1,Big Bang Theory,35,7
2266,Sheldon,9, Were you trying to impress Penny?,1,Big Bang Theory,34,6
2267,Leonard,9," No, no not at all. A little bit. ",1,Big Bang Theory,34,8
2268,Sheldon,9, How'd that work out for you?,1,Big Bang Theory,29,6
2269,Penny,9," Leonard, ready to go?",1,Big Bang Theory,22,4
2270,Sheldon,9," Libido 1, truth zero. ",1,Big Bang Theory,23,4
2271,Leonard,9," Okay, I'm going to ask you one more time, we did the work together, lets present the paper together.",1,Big Bang Theory,101,19
2272,Sheldon,9," And I'm telling you for the last time it's pandering, it's undignified and bite me. ",1,Big Bang Theory,85,15
2273,Leonard,9, Let's go.,1,Big Bang Theory,10,2
2274,Penny,9, Bye Sheldon. ,1,Big Bang Theory,14,2
2275,Sheldon,9," Goodbye Penny.  Oooh, one of these days, Pkshhhh!",1,Big Bang Theory,50,8
2277,Penny,9, There you go. ,1,Big Bang Theory,15,3
2278,Leonard,9," You're right, this side does look better. ",1,Big Bang Theory,43,7
2279,Penny,9," No, no, I didn't say better, I said less stained. ",1,Big Bang Theory,51,10
2280,Howard,9," I just checked the house, there's probably twenty, twenty-five people in there.",1,Big Bang Theory,80,12
2281,Leonard,9, You're kidding. ,1,Big Bang Theory,17,2
2282,Penny,9, Is that all?,1,Big Bang Theory,13,3
2283,Leonard,9," All? In particle physics, twenty five is Woodstock. ",1,Big Bang Theory,53,8
2284,Penny,9," Oh, well, then good!",1,Big Bang Theory,21,4
2285,Leonard,9," I wasn't expecting such a crowd, I'm a little nervous. ",1,Big Bang Theory,56,10
2286,Howard,9," It's okay, just open with a joke, you'll be fine. ",1,Big Bang Theory,51,10
2287,Leonard,9," A joke. Okay. How about this, um, okay, uh there's this farmer, and he has these chickens, but they won't lay any eggs. So, he calls a physicist to help. The physicist then does some calculations, and he says, um, I have a solution, but it only works with spherical chickens in a vacuum.  Right? ",1,Big Bang Theory,297,55
2288,Penny,9," Oh, sorry, I've just, I've heard it before. ",1,Big Bang Theory,45,8
2289,Howard,9," Let's roll. Hey, nice suit.",1,Big Bang Theory,28,5
2290,Leonard,9," It's a classic, right? ",1,Big Bang Theory,24,4
2291,Penny,9, I really should have brought my own car. ,1,Big Bang Theory,42,8
2293,Leonard,9," So, in conclusion, the data show that at temperatures approaching absolute zero, the moment of inertia changes, and the solid becomes a super-solid, which clearly appears to be a previously unknown state of matter.  Thank you.  Are there any questions?",1,Big Bang Theory,253,40
2295,Leonard,9, Any other questions?,1,Big Bang Theory,21,3
2296,Sheldon,9," Doctor Sheldon Cooper here, I am the lead author of this particular paper.  Thank you. And you, sir, you have completely skipped over the part where I was walking through the park, and I saw these children on a merry-go-round, which started me thinking about the moment of inertia in gasses like helium at temperatures approaching absolute zero. ",1,Big Bang Theory,347,58
2297,Leonard,9," I didn't skip it, it's just an anecdote. It's not science.",1,Big Bang Theory,59,11
2298,Sheldon,9," Oh, I see, was the apple falling on Newton's head, was that just an anecdote?",1,Big Bang Theory,78,15
2299,Leonard,9, You are not Isaac Newton.,1,Big Bang Theory,26,5
2300,Sheldon,9," No, no that's true, gravity would have been apparent to me without the apple. ",1,Big Bang Theory,79,14
2301,Leonard,9, You cannot possibly be that arrogant.,1,Big Bang Theory,38,6
2302,Sheldon,9," You continue to underestimate me, my good man. ",1,Big Bang Theory,48,8
2303,Leonard,9," Look, if you weren't happy with my presentation then maybe you should have given it with me.",1,Big Bang Theory,93,17
2304,Sheldon,9," As I have explained repeatedly, unlike you, I don't need validation from lesser minds. No offence. ",1,Big Bang Theory,100,16
2305,Leonard,9," Really, so why did you come?",1,Big Bang Theory,29,6
2306,Sheldon,9, Because I knew you'd screw this up.,1,Big Bang Theory,36,7
2307,Leonard,9, I didn't screw it up.,1,Big Bang Theory,22,5
2308,Sheldon,9," Oh, please. I admit, that spherical chicken joke, that was hilarious. But it was straight downhill from there. ",1,Big Bang Theory,112,18
2309,Leonard,9," I've had enough of your condescension. Maybe I didn't go to college when I was eleven like you, maybe I got my doctorate at 24 instead of 16, but you are not the only person who is smarter than everyone else in this room. No offense. And I am clearly not the only person who is tormented by insecurity and has an ego in need of constant validation.",1,Big Bang Theory,349,68
2310,Sheldon,9, So you admit that you're an egotist?,1,Big Bang Theory,37,7
2311,Leonard,9," Yes.  My name is Dr Leonard Hofstadter, and I could never please my parents so I need to get all my self-esteem from strangers like you. But he's worse.",1,Big Bang Theory,153,29
2312,Sheldon,9," Okay, that is it. ",1,Big Bang Theory,19,4
2313,Leonard,9, You cannot blow up my head with your mind. ,1,Big Bang Theory,44,9
2314,Sheldon,9, Then I'll settle for an aneurysm. ,1,Big Bang Theory,35,6
2315,Leonard,9, Stop it.,1,Big Bang Theory,9,2
2316,Sheldon,9," You hit me. You saw him, he hit me.",1,Big Bang Theory,36,9
2317,Leonard,9, You were trying to blow up my head.,1,Big Bang Theory,36,8
2318,Sheldon,9, So it was working.,1,Big Bang Theory,19,4
2319,Leonard,9," It wasn't, it was not, you are a nutcase.",1,Big Bang Theory,42,9
2320,Sheldon,9," Oh we'll see about that , heads up you people in the front row, this is a splash zone.",1,Big Bang Theory,87,19
2321,Leonard,9," Stop, stop it, quit it. ",1,Big Bang Theory,25,5
2322,Penny,9, Is this usually how these physics things go?,1,Big Bang Theory,45,8
2323,Howard,9, More often than you'd think.,1,Big Bang Theory,29,5
2324,Leonard,9, Vulcan nerve pinch!,1,Big Bang Theory,20,3
2326,Sheldon,9, You could have offered me a ride home. ,1,Big Bang Theory,40,8
2327,Leonard,9, You're lucky I didn't run you over. ,1,Big Bang Theory,37,7
2328,Sheldon,9," I really don't understand what you're so unhappy about, you begged me to come, I came, there's just no pleasing you. ",1,Big Bang Theory,118,21
2329,Leonard,9," You're right, I'm the problem, I'm the one that needs help. ",1,Big Bang Theory,61,11
2330,Sheldon,9," Well that's not much of an apology, but I'll take it. ",1,Big Bang Theory,55,11
2331,Leonard,9, Excuse me. Is there anything you'd like to apologise for?,1,Big Bang Theory,58,10
2332,Sheldon,9, Yes. I'm sorry I tried to blow up your head. It was uncalled for. ,1,Big Bang Theory,67,14
2333,Howard,9, You won't believe this.,1,Big Bang Theory,24,4
2334,Raj,9, Somebody got the whole thing on a cell phone and put it on youtube. ,1,Big Bang Theory,69,14
2335,Leonard,9, What? ,1,Big Bang Theory,7,1
2336,Sheldon,9," Now, who would do that?",1,Big Bang Theory,24,5
2337,Howard,9," That would be me. Hey, check it out, it's a featured video. . ",1,Big Bang Theory,63,13
2338,Leonard,9, Oh jeez. Is this suit really look that bad?,1,Big Bang Theory,44,9
2339,Sheldon,9," Forget your suit, look at my arms waving, I'm like a flamingo on Ritalin. ",1,Big Bang Theory,75,14
2340,Penny,9," Howard, would you like to explain to me why your facebook page has a picture of me sleeping on your shoulder captioned â€œMe and my Girlfriend?â€ù",1,Big Bang Theory,147,26
2341,Howard,9," Uh-oh, here comes â€œthe talk.â€ù ",1,Big Bang Theory,35,5
2349,Leonard,10," See, the liquid metal Terminators were created in the future by Skynet, and Skynet was developed by Miles Dyson, but that future no longer exists, due to Dyson's death in Terminator 2.",1,Big Bang Theory,185,32
2350,Sheldon,10," Okay, then riddle me this. Assuming all the good Terminators were originally evil Terminators created by Skynet but then reprogrammed by the future John Connor, why would Skynet, an artificial computer intelligence, bother to create a petite hot 17 year-old killer robot?",1,Big Bang Theory,272,42
2351,Leonard,10, Skynet is kinky? I don't know. ,1,Big Bang Theory,32,6
2352,Sheldon,10, Artificial intelligences do not have teen fetishes. ,1,Big Bang Theory,53,7
2353,Leonard,10," Alright, oh wait, they use it to in",1,Big Bang Theory,36,8
2354,Sheldon,10," , too late, I win. ",1,Big Bang Theory,20,5
2355,Penny,10, Let's go-oh-oh Ou-oooo-ut tonight. I have to go-oh-oh-oh ou-ooooo-ut tonight. ,1,Big Bang Theory,79,10
2356,Leonard,10, What the hell is that? ,1,Big Bang Theory,24,5
2357,Sheldon,10," I don't know, but if cats could sing, they'd hate it too. .",1,Big Bang Theory,60,13
2358,Penny,10," You wanna prowl, be my night owl,  we'll take my  Hey guys, hi! Where you going?",1,Big Bang Theory,81,16
2359,Leonard,10, What? Oh we just had to mail some letters and  throw away some chicken. ,1,Big Bang Theory,73,14
2360,Penny,10, You'll never guess what just happened.,1,Big Bang Theory,39,6
2361,Leonard,10," Oh, I give up.",1,Big Bang Theory,15,4
2362,Sheldon,10," I don't guess. As a scientist I reach conclusions based on observation and experimentation, although as I'm saying this it occurs to me you may have been employing a rhetorical device rendering my response moot. ",1,Big Bang Theory,213,35
2363,Penny,10, What was that?,1,Big Bang Theory,15,3
2364,Leonard,10," Believe it or not, personal growth. What happened?",1,Big Bang Theory,51,8
2365,Penny,10," Alright, remember when I auditioned for that workshop production of Rent, but I didn't get it and I couldn't figure out why?",1,Big Bang Theory,125,22
2366,Sheldon,10, I have a conclusion based on an observation.,1,Big Bang Theory,45,8
2367,Leonard,10, No you don't. No he doesn't.,1,Big Bang Theory,29,6
2368,Penny,10," Well, the girl they picked to play Mimi, she dropped out and they asked me to replace her. ",1,Big Bang Theory,92,18
2369,Leonard,10," Oh, congratulations, what a lucky break.",1,Big Bang Theory,41,6
2370,Penny,10," It's not a big deal, just a one night showcase, but they invite a lot of casting people and agents so, you never know. ",1,Big Bang Theory,120,24
2371,Sheldon,10, I think I know.,1,Big Bang Theory,16,4
2372,Leonard,10, No you don't. He doesn't.,1,Big Bang Theory,26,5
2373,Penny,10," It's this Friday at eight, you guys want to come?",1,Big Bang Theory,50,10
2375,Leonard,10," Because. uh, Friday, we are attending a symposium on molecular positronium.",1,Big Bang Theory,76,11
2376,Sheldon,10, I think that's a week from Tuesday at six. ,1,Big Bang Theory,44,9
2377,Leonard,10," No, it's this Friday, at eight. ",1,Big Bang Theory,33,6
2378,Penny,10," Oh, too bad, well, I got to get to rehearsal, see you guys. ",1,Big Bang Theory,61,13
2379,Leonard,10, See you.  ,1,Big Bang Theory,11,2
2380,Sheldon,10, You just lied to Penny.,1,Big Bang Theory,24,5
2381,Leonard,10," Yes, I did. ",1,Big Bang Theory,13,3
2382,Sheldon,10," And you did it so casually, no rapid breathing, no increase in perspiration.",1,Big Bang Theory,77,13
2383,Leonard,10, So?,1,Big Bang Theory,4,1
2384,Sheldon,10," So, lack of a physiological response while lying is characteristic of a violent sociopath. ",1,Big Bang Theory,92,14
2385,Leonard,10," Sheldon, are you worried about your safety.",1,Big Bang Theory,44,7
2386,Sheldon,10," No, I imagine if you were going to kill me you'd have done it a long time ago. ",1,Big Bang Theory,80,18
2387,Leonard,10, That's very true. ,1,Big Bang Theory,19,3
2389,Sheldon,10,"  Leonard,  Leonard,  Leonard",1,Big Bang Theory,29,3
2390,Leonard,10, What?,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
2391,Sheldon,10, I need to speak to you.,1,Big Bang Theory,24,6
2392,Leonard,10, It's two o'clock in the morning,1,Big Bang Theory,32,6
2393,Sheldon,10, It's important.,1,Big Bang Theory,16,2
2394,Leonard,10, I highly doubt that. Go away. . Are you still out there? ,1,Big Bang Theory,58,12
2395,Sheldon,10, Yes. ,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
2396,Leonard,10, What? ,1,Big Bang Theory,7,1
2397,Sheldon,10," You're right, it can wait until morning. ",1,Big Bang Theory,42,7
2398,Leonard,10," What, what, what, what, what? ",1,Big Bang Theory,31,5
2399,Sheldon,10," Never mind. I clearly woke you up in the middle of a REM cycle, you're in no state to talk.",1,Big Bang Theory,92,20
2400,Leonard,10," Sheldon, what is it? ",1,Big Bang Theory,22,4
2401,Sheldon,10, I'm uncomfortable having been included in your lie to Penny. ,1,Big Bang Theory,62,10
2402,Leonard,10, What was I supposed to say. ,1,Big Bang Theory,29,6
2403,Sheldon,10, You could have told her the truth.,1,Big Bang Theory,35,7
2404,Leonard,10, That would have hurt her feelings. ,1,Big Bang Theory,36,6
2405,Sheldon,10, Is that a relevant factor? ,1,Big Bang Theory,28,5
2406,Leonard,10, Yes.,1,Big Bang Theory,5,1
2407,Sheldon,10, Then I suppose you could have agreed to go. ,1,Big Bang Theory,45,9
2408,Leonard,10, And what would I have said afterwards? ,1,Big Bang Theory,40,7
2409,Sheldon,10," I would suggest something to the effect of, singing is neither an appropriate vocation nor avocation for you, and if you disagree, I'd recommend you have a CAT scan, to look for a tumour pressing on the cognitive processing centre of your brain.",1,Big Bang Theory,246,43
2410,Leonard,10," I couldn't say that, I would have to say, you were terrific and I can't wait to hear you sing again. ",1,Big Bang Theory,102,21
2411,Sheldon,10, Why? ,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
2412,Leonard,10," It's the social protocol, it's what you do when you have a friend who's proud of something they really suck at. ",1,Big Bang Theory,113,21
2413,Sheldon,10, I was not aware of that. ,1,Big Bang Theory,26,6
2414,Leonard,10, Well now you are.,1,Big Bang Theory,18,4
2415,Sheldon,10," Oh, alright. Leonard.",1,Big Bang Theory,22,3
2416,Leonard,10, Yes.,1,Big Bang Theory,5,1
2417,Sheldon,10," When we played chess earlier, you were terrific and I can't wait to play you again. Goodnight. ",1,Big Bang Theory,96,17
2419,Sheldon,10,"  Leonard,  Leonard,  Leonard,  Leonard, .. ",1,Big Bang Theory,44,5
2420,Leonard,10, Oooaw. This would be so much easier if I were a violent sociopath.  What?,1,Big Bang Theory,74,14
2421,Sheldon,10," I was analysing our lie, and I believe we're in danger of Penny seeing through the ruse.",1,Big Bang Theory,89,17
2422,Leonard,10, How?,1,Big Bang Theory,5,1
2423,Sheldon,10," Simple. If she were to log on to www.socalphysicsgroup.org/activities/other, click on upcoming events, scroll down to seminars, download the pdf schedule, and look for the seminar on molecular positronium, well then, bippidy-boppidy-boo, our pants are metaphorically on fire. ",1,Big Bang Theory,277,38
2424,Sheldon,10," Well, sir, my trousers will not be igniting today. ",1,Big Bang Theory,52,9
2426,Sheldon,10,"  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Good morning.",1,Big Bang Theory,39,5
2427,Penny,10, Do you have any idea what time it is? ,1,Big Bang Theory,39,9
2428,Sheldon,10," Of course I do. My watch is linked to the atomic clock in Boulder, Colorado. It's accurate to one tenth of a second. But as I'm saying this it occurs to me that once again your question may have been rhetorical.",1,Big Bang Theory,212,41
2429,Penny,10, What do you want?,1,Big Bang Theory,18,4
2430,Sheldon,10, Remember how Leonard told you we couldn't come to your performance because we were attending a symposium on molecular positronium?,1,Big Bang Theory,131,20
2431,Penny,10, I remember symposium.,1,Big Bang Theory,22,3
2432,Sheldon,10," Yes, well, he lied.",1,Big Bang Theory,20,4
2433,Penny,10," Wait, what?",1,Big Bang Theory,12,2
2434,Sheldon,10," He lied, and I'm feeling very uncomfortable about it.",1,Big Bang Theory,54,9
2435,Penny,10, Well imagine how I'm feeling. ,1,Big Bang Theory,31,5
2436,Sheldon,10, Hungry? Tired? I'm sorry this really isn't my strong suit. ,1,Big Bang Theory,60,10
2438,Leonard,10," You told her I lied, why would you tell her I lied?",1,Big Bang Theory,52,12
2439,Sheldon,10, To help you. ,1,Big Bang Theory,14,3
2440,Leonard,10," I'm sorry, I'm not seeing the help.",1,Big Bang Theory,36,7
2441,Sheldon,10," She was going to see through your lie eventually, so I told her that you were lying to protect me. ",1,Big Bang Theory,100,20
2442,Leonard,10," Oh, I'm getting a bad feeling. ",1,Big Bang Theory,32,6
2443,Sheldon,10," Hunger? Indigestion, I'm sorry I'm really not very good at this. Anyway, Penny now believes that on Friday night, we're going to participate in my cousin Leopold's drug intervention. ",1,Big Bang Theory,184,29
2444,Leonard,10, Your cousin Leopold?,1,Big Bang Theory,21,3
2445,Sheldon,10," Yea, who most people call Leo, but he also answers to Lee, remember that, it's important. ",1,Big Bang Theory,91,16
2446,Leonard,10, What's important?,1,Big Bang Theory,18,2
2447,Sheldon,10," Details, Leonard, the success or failure of our deceitful enterprise turns on details. ",1,Big Bang Theory,88,13
2448,Leonard,10, Do you have a cousin Leopold.,1,Big Bang Theory,30,6
2449,Sheldon,10," No, I made him up. I think you'd call him Lee. ",1,Big Bang Theory,48,11
2450,Leonard,10," I don't get it, I already told her a lie, why replace it with a different lie?",1,Big Bang Theory,79,17
2451,Sheldon,10," Well, first of all, your lie was laughably transparent, where mine is exquisitely convoluted. While you were sleeping I was weaving an un-unravelable web. ",1,Big Bang Theory,156,24
2452,Leonard,10, Un-unravelable?,1,Big Bang Theory,16,1
2453,Sheldon,10," Yes, if she googles Leopold Houston she'll find a facebook page, an online blog depicting his descent into drug use, and a desperate yet hopeful listing on e-harmony.com.",1,Big Bang Theory,171,28
2454,Leonard,10," Okay, why would I go to a drug intervention for your cousing.",1,Big Bang Theory,62,12
2455,Sheldon,10," Ah, because it's in Long Beach, and I don't drive. ",1,Big Bang Theory,52,10
2456,Leonard,10, We're going to Long Beach?,1,Big Bang Theory,27,5
2457,Sheldon,10," No, of course not, there's no cousin Leo, there's no intervention, focus Leonard.",1,Big Bang Theory,82,13
2458,Leonard,10," Oh, come on!",1,Big Bang Theory,13,3
2459,Sheldon,10," We just leave the house on Friday night, and we return in the wee hours emotionally wrung out from the work of convincing Leo to go back into rehab.",1,Big Bang Theory,149,29
2460,Leonard,10, So he goes back into rehab?,1,Big Bang Theory,28,6
2461,Sheldon,10," Yes, but, he can relapse if Penny ever invites us to go hear her sing again.",1,Big Bang Theory,77,16
2462,Leonard,10, You still told her I lied.,1,Big Bang Theory,27,6
2463,Sheldon,10," For a noble purpose, to spare me the social embarrassment of having a drug-addled first cousin, which I'm assuming is embarrassing, yes?",1,Big Bang Theory,137,22
2464,Leonard,10, I don't know. How am I supposed to remember all of this.,1,Big Bang Theory,57,12
2465,Sheldon,10," That's the best part, you don't have to, see I told Penny that you would be embarrassed, if you knew that she found out that you had lied, so she's agreed to operate as if the original lie was still in force. ",1,Big Bang Theory,210,42
2466,Leonard,10," So she's expecting me to lie about going to a symposium in Pasadena, when in actuality we're pretending to go to a drug intervention in Long Beach? ",1,Big Bang Theory,149,27
2467,Sheldon,10, Un-unravelable. ,1,Big Bang Theory,17,1
2469,Leonard,10," Oh hey Penny, wow, look at you, all ready for your showcase, you look great.",1,Big Bang Theory,77,15
2470,Penny,10, Thanks. I just wanted to come by and wish you guys luck with your symposium. ,1,Big Bang Theory,78,15
2471,Leonard,10," Oh, well, thankyou.",1,Big Bang Theory,20,3
2472,Penny,10," You know, I got to tell you, a lot of friends would let their friend go alone, but that's not who you are, you are the kind of guy who stands by a friend when when he has a symposium to go to. ",1,Big Bang Theory,194,43
2473,Leonard,10, I don't know what to say. ,1,Big Bang Theory,27,6
2474,Penny,10," It's okay, Leonard ",1,Big Bang Theory,20,3
2475,Leonard,10," Oh, okay, alright, good. ",1,Big Bang Theory,26,4
2476,Howard,10," Oh boy, group hug.",1,Big Bang Theory,19,4
2477,Penny,10, Uh-huh!,1,Big Bang Theory,8,1
2478,Howard,10, Uh-huh?,1,Big Bang Theory,8,1
2479,Penny,10, Uh-huh!,1,Big Bang Theory,8,1
2480,Howard,10, Okay. So what's up? ,1,Big Bang Theory,21,4
2481,Sheldon,10," Well, uh, Penny is on her way to perform in a one night showcase production of Rent, which we are unable to attend because we are going to a symposium on molecular positronium, given by Dr Emile Farminfarmian.",1,Big Bang Theory,210,38
2482,Howard,10," Wait a minute, Farminfarmian is speaking and you're Bogarding the symposium. ",1,Big Bang Theory,78,11
2483,Leonard,10," Howard, I'm sorry we're we're",1,Big Bang Theory,30,5
2484,Howard,10," No, no, you're quark-blocking us. ",1,Big Bang Theory,35,5
2485,Leonard,10, I don't know what to say.,1,Big Bang Theory,26,6
2486,Howard,10, Wow.,1,Big Bang Theory,5,1
2487,Leonard,10," Howard, listen",1,Big Bang Theory,15,2
2488,Howard,10," No, it's okay, it's your Millenium Falcon, you and Chewbacca do whatever you want to do. Me and Princess Leia here will find some other way to spend the evening. ",1,Big Bang Theory,163,30
2489,Penny,10," Howard, wait. Sheldon, I think we should tell them.",1,Big Bang Theory,52,9
2490,Sheldon,10," Okay, sure. I don't see a problem with that. ",1,Big Bang Theory,46,9
2491,Penny,10," There's no symposium, Leonard lied to me, isn't that right Leonard. ",1,Big Bang Theory,69,11
2492,Leonard,10, Well I don't know what to say. ,1,Big Bang Theory,32,7
2493,Penny,10," It's okay, I do, look, Leonard is helping Sheldon through a family crisis, he made up the whole story about the symposium with Dr Farmin..farmian",1,Big Bang Theory,146,25
2494,Sheldon,10, Good for you. ,1,Big Bang Theory,15,3
2495,Penny,10," Hah, yeah! Because he didn't want Sheldon to be embarrassed, and there is nothing to be embarrassed okay, every family in America has a relative holed up in a garage somewhere huffing paint thinner.",1,Big Bang Theory,199,34
2496,Howard,10," No, I'm lost too, I think she skipped a step. ",1,Big Bang Theory,47,10
2497,Penny,10," No, look, Sheldon's cousin Leo escaped rehab, and he's in a Motel 8 at Long Beach, the whole family's going out for an intervention. Leonard is driving Sheldon down there to help him through this because he's such a good man.",1,Big Bang Theory,226,41
2498,Leonard,10," Oh, another hug, thank you.",1,Big Bang Theory,28,5
2499,Penny,10," Alright you guys, good luck.",1,Big Bang Theory,29,5
2500,Leonard,10, Thanks Penny. ,1,Big Bang Theory,15,2
2501,Howard,10," Yeah, uh, break a leg.",1,Big Bang Theory,23,5
2502,Sheldon,10, Break a leg. ,1,Big Bang Theory,14,3
2503,Howard,10," So, road trip to Long Beach.",1,Big Bang Theory,29,6
2504,Leonard,10," No, we're not going to Long Beach.",1,Big Bang Theory,35,7
2505,Raj,10, Why not? ,1,Big Bang Theory,10,2
2506,Leonard,10, Because Sheldon doesn't have a drug addicted cousin Leopold. ,1,Big Bang Theory,62,9
2507,Raj,10," Oh, too bad. I've always wanted to go to Long Beach. ",1,Big Bang Theory,54,11
2508,Sheldon,10," It's a very nice community. The Queen Mary is docked there, once the largest ocean liner in the world, it's now a hotel and restaurant where they host a surprisingly gripping murder mystery dinner. ",1,Big Bang Theory,199,34
2509,Raj,10, Sounds fun.,1,Big Bang Theory,12,2
2510,Howard,10, I'm game.,1,Big Bang Theory,10,2
2511,Raj,10, Shotgun.,1,Big Bang Theory,9,1
2512,Sheldon,10," No, no, no, Leonard gets nauseous unless he sits in front, and even then it's iffy.",1,Big Bang Theory,84,16
2513,Leonard,10," Wait, are we really going to Long Beach? ",1,Big Bang Theory,42,8
2515,Sheldon,10,"  Leonard,  Leonard,  Leonard",1,Big Bang Theory,29,3
2516,Leonard,10," Let it go, Sheldon, the murderer was the first mate whether it makes sense to you or not. ",1,Big Bang Theory,91,18
2517,Sheldon,10," No, that's the least of our worries. I've been doing some research on addiction, both the biochemical and behavioural aspects, and I think there's a problem with the current version of our lie. ",1,Big Bang Theory,195,33
2518,Leonard,10," What are you talking about, it's fine, she bought it, it's over. ",1,Big Bang Theory,66,12
2519,Sheldon,10," Sadly, it's not. Substance abuse is a lifelong struggle, but beyond that I have realised that the Leo I described would not have agreed to go to rehab.",1,Big Bang Theory,152,28
2520,Leonard,10, Why not? ,1,Big Bang Theory,10,2
2521,Sheldon,10, Because Leo is a middle child. ,1,Big Bang Theory,32,6
2522,Leonard,10," There is no Leo, how can you say that? ",1,Big Bang Theory,40,9
2523,Sheldon,10," You didn't read the bio, did you? He's not just a middle child, he's the quintessential middle child, from a broken home to boot. Psychologically speaking, the attention he gets by rebelling even to the point of self-destruction is more emotionally valuable than the help he would get at rehab.",1,Big Bang Theory,295,50
2524,Leonard,10, I've got a solution.,1,Big Bang Theory,21,4
2525,Sheldon,10," Great, what is it?",1,Big Bang Theory,19,4
2526,Leonard,10, Get out.,1,Big Bang Theory,9,2
2527,Sheldon,10," Fine.  I've hesitated to point this out, but I must now remind you that we are in our current predicament because of your initial and totally inadequate deceit. I'm just trying to clean up after your mess.  We'll talk in the morning.",1,Big Bang Theory,234,42
2530,Leonard,10, Who are you? ,1,Big Bang Theory,14,3
2532,Leonard,10," Oh, God! Sheldon does not have a cousin Leo.",1,Big Bang Theory,45,9
2534,Sheldon,10," Excuse me, we just went over this. As the quintessential middle child, your addiction is rooted in your unmet need for attention.",1,Big Bang Theory,130,22
2536,Sheldon,10," For your information, this is all based on solid research, stick with the character profile I wrote for you. ",1,Big Bang Theory,110,19
2537,Leonard,10, Sheldon?,1,Big Bang Theory,9,1
2538,Sheldon,10," I'm sorry, Leonard, this is Toby Loobenfeld, he's a research assistant in the particle physics lab, but he also minored in theatre at MIT.",1,Big Bang Theory,139,24
2540,Leonard,10," Yeah, I got it, Sheldon, why?",1,Big Bang Theory,30,6
2541,Sheldon,10," Well, you see, while Leo would not have gone into rehab, it is completely plausible that we would have talked him into leaving the motel, and coming home with us.",1,Big Bang Theory,163,30
2542,Leonard,10, Oh!,1,Big Bang Theory,4,1
2544,Sheldon,10," No. We're going with middle child, and a generic predisposition to inadequate serotonin production.",1,Big Bang Theory,100,14
2546,Sheldon,10," Subtextually, of course.  Just have fun with it.  Morning Penny.",1,Big Bang Theory,65,10
2547,Penny,10, Hi. How did the intervention go.,1,Big Bang Theory,33,6
2548,Sheldon,10," Unfortunately, we weren't able to convince him to go to rehab. ",1,Big Bang Theory,64,11
2549,Penny,10," Well, based on what you told me, I'm not surprised. ",1,Big Bang Theory,53,10
2550,Sheldon,10," But we did convince him to leave the motel. Come say hello. Leo, this is Penny, our friend and neighbour.",1,Big Bang Theory,106,20
2551,Penny,10," Hi Leo, how are you feeling?",1,Big Bang Theory,29,6
2553,Penny,10, No.,1,Big Bang Theory,4,1
2555,Leonard,10," Well, that's Leo. Hey, um, why don't you tell me about your showcase last night?",1,Big Bang Theory,81,15
2556,Penny,10," Oh, it was okay I guess, wasn't a big turn out but they both really seemed to like it. ",1,Big Bang Theory,88,19
2557,Leonard,10, There were only two people there?,1,Big Bang Theory,34,6
2558,Penny,10, By the end. Yeah. ,1,Big Bang Theory,19,4
2560,Penny,10, I'm I'm sorry.,1,Big Bang Theory,15,3
2562,Sheldon,10, Don't forget his genetic predisposition towards addiction.,1,Big Bang Theory,59,7
2564,Sheldon,10, There have been studies.,1,Big Bang Theory,25,4
2566,Sheldon,10," How could there be a double blind study, who would be the control group. ",1,Big Bang Theory,74,14
2567,Leonard,10," As you can see, detoxing can get pretty ugly, let's give them some privacy.",1,Big Bang Theory,76,14
2568,Penny,10," Yeah. Hey, do you want to come over to my place, have coffee?",1,Big Bang Theory,62,13
2569,Leonard,10, Sounds good.,1,Big Bang Theory,13,2
2570,Penny,10," I have a video of me singing last night, do you want to see it? ",1,Big Bang Theory,65,15
2571,Leonard,10," Gee, why wouldn't I?",1,Big Bang Theory,21,4
2572,Penny,10," This is even better than you coming to the showcase, because now I get to watch you watch me.",1,Big Bang Theory,94,19
2573,Leonard,10, Yeah! Funny how things work out. ,1,Big Bang Theory,34,6
2575,Sheldon,10, Your parents made the right decision. ,1,Big Bang Theory,39,6
2579,Penny,10," Leo, you are a very sweet, really funny guy. You're gonna do okay. ",1,Big Bang Theory,68,13
2581,Leonard,10, How long is he going to stay here.,1,Big Bang Theory,35,8
2582,Sheldon,10," He's a homeless drug addict, Leonard, where is he going to go? Boy, you have a lot to learn about lying.",1,Big Bang Theory,105,21
2584,Sheldon,11, Checkmate.,1,Big Bang Theory,11,1
2585,Leonard,11, O-o-o-o-h! Again?,1,Big Bang Theory,18,2
2586,Sheldon,11," Obviously you're not well suited for three-dimensional chess, perhaps three dimensional candyland would be more your speed. ",1,Big Bang Theory,125,17
2587,Leonard,11, Just reset the board.,1,Big Bang Theory,22,4
2588,Sheldon,11, It must be humbling to suck on so many different levels. ,1,Big Bang Theory,58,11
2589,Penny,11, Hi guys.,1,Big Bang Theory,9,2
2590,Leonard,11, Hey! ,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
2591,Penny,11, Did you get my mail.,1,Big Bang Theory,21,5
2592,Leonard,11," Yeah, right here. How was Nebraska?",1,Big Bang Theory,36,6
2593,Penny,11," Oh, better than North Dakota!  I guess that joke's only funny in Nebraska.",1,Big Bang Theory,75,13
2594,Sheldon,11, From the data at hand you really can't draw that conclusion. All you can say with absolute certainty is that that joke is not funny here. ,1,Big Bang Theory,139,26
2595,Penny,11," Boy, it's good to be back. ",1,Big Bang Theory,28,6
2596,Leonard,11, How was your family?,1,Big Bang Theory,21,4
2597,Penny,11," Ugh, it was the worst trip, everyone got sick over the weekend.",1,Big Bang Theory,64,12
2598,Sheldon,11, Sick? ,1,Big Bang Theory,7,1
2599,Leonard,11, Here we go. ,1,Big Bang Theory,13,3
2600,Sheldon,11, What kind of sick?,1,Big Bang Theory,19,4
2601,Penny,11," Oh, the flu I guess.",1,Big Bang Theory,21,5
2602,Sheldon,11," I don't need you to guess, I need you to know, now when did the symptoms first appear?",1,Big Bang Theory,87,18
2603,Penny,11, Maybe Friday.,1,Big Bang Theory,14,2
2604,Sheldon,11," Friday, was that morning or afternoon? ",1,Big Bang Theory,40,6
2605,Penny,11, I I don't,1,Big Bang Theory,10,3
2606,Sheldon,11," Think woman, who blew their nose and when? ",1,Big Bang Theory,44,8
2607,Leonard,11," Sheldon, relax, she doesn't have any symptoms, I'm sure she's not contagious.",1,Big Bang Theory,78,12
2608,Sheldon,11," Oh please, if influenza was only contagious after symptoms appear it would have died out thousands of years ago. Somewhere between tool using and cave painting, homo habilus would have figured out to kill the guy with the runny nose. ",1,Big Bang Theory,235,40
2609,Leonard,11," Penny, you'll have to excuse Sheldon, he's a bit of a germophobe. ",1,Big Bang Theory,67,12
2610,Penny,11," Oh, it's okay, I understand.",1,Big Bang Theory,29,5
2611,Sheldon,11," Thanks for your consideration, now please leave.",1,Big Bang Theory,49,7
2612,Leonard,11, You'd better go before he starts spraying you with Lysol. ,1,Big Bang Theory,59,10
2613,Penny,11," Okay, well, thank you for getting my mail.",1,Big Bang Theory,43,8
2614,Leonard,11, No problem. Welcome home. ,1,Big Bang Theory,27,4
2615,Sheldon,11, What?,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
2617,Leonard,11, What the hell are you doing?,1,Big Bang Theory,29,6
2618,Sheldon,11, I'm making petrie dishes to grow throat cultures. ,1,Big Bang Theory,51,8
2619,Leonard,11, With lime jello?,1,Big Bang Theory,17,3
2620,Sheldon,11," I need a growth medium, and someone polished off the apricot yoghurt. Here, swab my throat.",1,Big Bang Theory,92,16
2621,Leonard,11, I don't think so.,1,Big Bang Theory,18,4
2622,Sheldon,11, Leonard! If I'm going to get ahead of this thing I need to find out what's growing in my throat. ,1,Big Bang Theory,98,20
2623,Leonard,11," Sheldon, you are not sick. This is, but you are not. ",1,Big Bang Theory,54,11
2624,Sheldon,11, We have no idea what pathogen Typhoid Penny has introduced into our environment. And having never been to Nebraska I'm fairly certain that I have no cornhusking antibodies. ,1,Big Bang Theory,174,28
2625,Leonard,11," Sheldon, don't you think you're overreacting? ",1,Big Bang Theory,47,6
2626,Sheldon,11," When I'm lying comatose in a hospital relying on inferior minds to cure me, these jello cultures and my accompanying notes will give them a fighting chance. ",1,Big Bang Theory,158,27
2627,Leonard,11, I'm going back to bed. ,1,Big Bang Theory,24,5
2628,Sheldon,11, Wait.  Put this in the bathroom.,1,Big Bang Theory,33,6
2629,Leonard,11, What for? ,1,Big Bang Theory,11,2
2630,Sheldon,11, I need to measure my fluid intake and output to make sure my kidneys aren't shutting down.,1,Big Bang Theory,91,17
2631,Leonard,11, I mix pancake batter in this! ,1,Big Bang Theory,31,6
2632,Sheldon,11," No, that measuring cup has always been for urine.",1,Big Bang Theory,50,9
2633,Leonard,11," You had time to make a label for everything in this apartment, including the label maker, but you didn't have ten seconds to make one that said urine cup? ",1,Big Bang Theory,156,29
2634,Sheldon,11, It's right here on the bottom. ,1,Big Bang Theory,32,6
2635,Leonard,11, Huh. I guess I owe the Betty Crocker company a letter of apology. ,1,Big Bang Theory,67,13
2637,Sheldon,11," Oh, dear God.  Leonard! Leonard, I'm sick!",1,Big Bang Theory,43,7
2638,Sheldon,11, Leonard! Leonard I'm sick!,1,Big Bang Theory,27,4
2639,Sheldon,11," Leonard! Leonard! Leonard. Leonard, my comforter fell down, and my sinuses hurt when I bend over. Leonard?  Ow! ",1,Big Bang Theory,113,18
2640,Leonard,11, Hey.,1,Big Bang Theory,5,1
2641,Sheldon,11," Leonard, where are you? ",1,Big Bang Theory,25,4
2642,Leonard,11, I'm at work. ,1,Big Bang Theory,14,3
2643,Sheldon,11, At six-thirty in the morning? ,1,Big Bang Theory,31,5
2644,Leonard,11, Yes.,1,Big Bang Theory,5,1
2645,Sheldon,11, On Sunday? ,1,Big Bang Theory,12,2
2646,Leonard,11, Yes.,1,Big Bang Theory,5,1
2647,Sheldon,11, Why? ,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
2648,Leonard,11, They asked me to come in.,1,Big Bang Theory,26,6
2649,Sheldon,11," Well, I didn't hear the phone ring.",1,Big Bang Theory,36,7
2650,Leonard,11, They texted me. ,1,Big Bang Theory,17,3
2651,Sheldon,11," Well, as I predicted, I am sick. My fever has been tracking up exponentially since 2am, and I am producing sputum at an alarming rate. ",1,Big Bang Theory,136,25
2652,Leonard,11, No kidding?,1,Big Bang Theory,12,2
2653,Sheldon,11," No. Not only that, it has shifted from clear to milky green. ",1,Big Bang Theory,62,12
2654,Leonard,11," Alright, well, get some rest and drink plenty of fluids. ",1,Big Bang Theory,58,10
2655,Sheldon,11, What else would I drink? Gasses? Solids? Ionised plasma?,1,Big Bang Theory,57,9
2656,Leonard,11, Drink whatever you want.,1,Big Bang Theory,25,4
2657,Sheldon,11, I want soup.,1,Big Bang Theory,13,3
2658,Leonard,11, Then make soup. ,1,Big Bang Theory,17,3
2659,Sheldon,11, We don't have soup. ,1,Big Bang Theory,21,4
2660,Leonard,11," I'm at work, Sheldon.  ",1,Big Bang Theory,24,4
2661,Sheldon,11, Is that a dog?,1,Big Bang Theory,15,4
2662,Leonard,11," Yes, ",1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
2663,Sheldon,11, In the lab?,1,Big Bang Theory,12,3
2664,Leonard,11," Yes, they're training dogs to operate the centrifuge for when they need dogs to operate the centrifuge for blind scientists, I have to go. ",1,Big Bang Theory,140,24
2667,Howard,11," I know it's the phone, Ma, I hear the phone.",1,Big Bang Theory,45,10
2669,Howard,11, I don't know.,1,Big Bang Theory,14,3
2671,Howard,11, How can I ask them when I'm talking to you!  Hello.,1,Big Bang Theory,52,11
2672,Leonard,11," Howard, it's Leonard, code Milky Green. ",1,Big Bang Theory,41,6
2673,Howard,11," Dear Lord, not Milky Green! ",1,Big Bang Theory,29,5
2674,Leonard,11," Affirmative, with fever.",1,Big Bang Theory,25,3
2676,Howard,11, It's Leonard.,1,Big Bang Theory,14,2
2678,Howard,11, Sheldon's sick.,1,Big Bang Theory,16,2
2680,Howard,11," For God's sake, Ma, I'm twenty six years old.",1,Big Bang Theory,46,9
2682,Howard,11, Chocolate milk and eggoes please! ,1,Big Bang Theory,35,5
2683,Leonard,11," Howard, listen to me.",1,Big Bang Theory,22,4
2684,Howard,11," Hang on, call waiting.",1,Big Bang Theory,23,4
2685,Leonard,11," No, don't, don't.",1,Big Bang Theory,18,3
2686,Howard,11, Hello.,1,Big Bang Theory,7,1
2687,Sheldon,11," Howard, I'm sick. ",1,Big Bang Theory,19,3
2688,Howard,11," Howard's sleeping, this is his mother. Why are you calling at this ungodly hour? ",1,Big Bang Theory,82,14
2689,Sheldon,11, I need soup.,1,Big Bang Theory,13,3
2690,Howard,11, Then call your own mother.  It was Sheldon.,1,Big Bang Theory,44,8
2691,Leonard,11, I tried to stop you. ,1,Big Bang Theory,22,5
2692,Howard,11," It's my own fault, I forgot the protocol we put in place after the great ear infection of '06. ",1,Big Bang Theory,96,19
2693,Leonard,11," You call Koothrappali, we need to find a place to lay low for the next eighteen to twenty four hours. ",1,Big Bang Theory,103,20
2694,Howard,11," Stand by. Ma, can my friends come over?",1,Big Bang Theory,40,8
2696,Howard,11, That's a negatory. But there's a Planet of the Apes marathon at the New Art today. ,1,Big Bang Theory,84,16
2697,Leonard,11," Five movies, two hours apiece. It's a start. ",1,Big Bang Theory,46,8
2700,Penny,11," No, just crazy. Sheldon, what are you doing here?",1,Big Bang Theory,50,9
2701,Sheldon,11," I'm sick, thank you very much. ",1,Big Bang Theory,32,6
2702,Penny,11," How could you have gotten it from me, I'm not sick.",1,Big Bang Theory,52,11
2703,Sheldon,11, You're a carrier. All these people here are doomed. You're doomed! ,1,Big Bang Theory,68,11
2704,Penny,11," Shhh! Sheldon, what do you want.",1,Big Bang Theory,33,6
2705,Sheldon,11, I want soup.,1,Big Bang Theory,13,3
2706,Penny,11, Why didn't you just.  Why didn't you just have soup at home. ,1,Big Bang Theory,62,12
2707,Sheldon,11," Penny, I have an IQ of 187, don't you imagine that if there were a way for me to have had soup at home I would have thought of it?",1,Big Bang Theory,131,30
2708,Penny,11, You can have soup delivered.,1,Big Bang Theory,29,5
2709,Sheldon,11," I did not think of that. Clearly febrile delirium is setting in, please bring me some soup while I still understand what a spoon is for. ",1,Big Bang Theory,138,26
2710,Penny,11," Okay, what kind of soup do you want.",1,Big Bang Theory,37,8
2711,Sheldon,11," Well, my mother used to make me this split pea with little frankfurter slices and these home made croutons.",1,Big Bang Theory,108,19
2712,Penny,11, We have Chicken Tortilla and Potato Leek. ,1,Big Bang Theory,43,7
2713,Sheldon,11, Can I get any of those with little frankfurter slices and home made croutons?,1,Big Bang Theory,78,14
2714,Penny,11, No.,1,Big Bang Theory,4,1
2715,Sheldon,11, Then surprise me.  Would you call that moss green or forest green? ,1,Big Bang Theory,68,12
2717,Howard,11," Look at this, everyone went chimp. ",1,Big Bang Theory,36,6
2718,Raj,11," Well I'd like to point out, I voted for orang-utan, but you shouted me down. .",1,Big Bang Theory,79,16
2719,Leonard,11," Oh, hi Penny!",1,Big Bang Theory,14,3
2720,Penny,11," Hey, where are you? ",1,Big Bang Theory,21,4
2721,Leonard,11, I'm uh at work.,1,Big Bang Theory,16,4
2722,Penny,11, You sound funny.,1,Big Bang Theory,17,3
2723,Leonard,11, I'm uh in a I'm in a radiation suit. What's up?,1,Big Bang Theory,48,11
2724,Penny,11," Yeah, well I'm at work too, and you'll never guess who's here infecting my entire station. ",1,Big Bang Theory,92,16
2725,Leonard,11, Sheldon's at the Cheesecake Factory.  Just tell him to go home. ,1,Big Bang Theory,65,11
2726,Penny,11," He won't leave, he says he's afraid he'll pass out on the bus and someone will harvest his organs.",1,Big Bang Theory,99,19
2728,Penny,11, Can you please come get him? ,1,Big Bang Theory,30,6
2729,Leonard,11," Uh, yeah, I'd be I'd be happy to Penny.  Oh my God there's a breech in the radiation unit  The whole city is in jeopardy, oh my God, Professor Googenfeil is melting, gotta go, bye!  I feel really guilty. ",1,Big Bang Theory,205,39
2730,Raj,11, You did what you had to do. ,1,Big Bang Theory,29,7
2731,Howard,11, Take your stinking paws off my popcorn you damn dirty ape. ,1,Big Bang Theory,60,11
2733,Sheldon,11, Thanks for bringing me home. ,1,Big Bang Theory,30,5
2734,Penny,11," Oh, it's okay, I didn't really need to work today, it's not like I have rent or car payments or anything.",1,Big Bang Theory,106,21
2735,Sheldon,11, Good. Good.,1,Big Bang Theory,12,2
2736,Penny,11," Okay, well, you feel better.",1,Big Bang Theory,29,5
2737,Sheldon,11," Wait, where are you going? ",1,Big Bang Theory,28,5
2738,Penny,11," Um, home, to write some bad cheques.",1,Big Bang Theory,37,7
2739,Sheldon,11, You're going to leave me? ,1,Big Bang Theory,27,5
2740,Penny,11," Sheldon, you are a grown man, haven't you ever been sick before? ",1,Big Bang Theory,66,12
2741,Sheldon,11," Well, of course, but, not by myself. ",1,Big Bang Theory,38,7
2742,Penny,11," Really, never?",1,Big Bang Theory,15,2
2743,Sheldon,11," Well, once. When I was fifteen, and spending the summer at the Heidelberg Institute in Germany.",1,Big Bang Theory,96,16
2744,Penny,11, Studying abroad?,1,Big Bang Theory,17,2
2745,Sheldon,11," No, visiting professor. Anyway, the local cuisine was a little more sausage-based than I'm used to, and the result was an internal blitzkrieg with my lower intestine playing the part of Czechoslovakia. ",1,Big Bang Theory,203,32
2746,Penny,11, And there was no-one there to take care of you?,1,Big Bang Theory,48,10
2747,Sheldon,11," No. No, my mum had to fly back to Texas to help my dad because the house had slipped off the cinderblocks again. ",1,Big Bang Theory,114,23
2748,Penny,11, Again?,1,Big Bang Theory,7,1
2749,Sheldon,11," It was tornado season. And it was an aluminium house. Anyway, the housekeeper in the faculty residence didn't speak any English, when I finally managed to convince her I was sick, she said â€œMÃ¶chtest Du eine DarmspÃ_lung?â€ù",1,Big Bang Theory,227,37
2750,Penny,11, What does that mean?,1,Big Bang Theory,21,4
2751,Sheldon,11," Based on what happened next, I assume it means â€œwould you like an enema?â€ù",1,Big Bang Theory,78,14
2752,Penny,11," Okay, sweetie, I'll take care of you, what do you need?",1,Big Bang Theory,56,11
2753,Sheldon,11," Well, my mom used to give me sponge baths. ",1,Big Bang Theory,44,9
2754,Penny,11," Okay, ground rules, no sponge baths, and definitely no enemas. ",1,Big Bang Theory,64,10
2755,Sheldon,11, Agreed. ,1,Big Bang Theory,9,1
2757,Raj,11," Here we go, ten and a half hours of apey goodness. ",1,Big Bang Theory,52,11
2758,Leonard,11," Oh dammit, my glasses. Okay, I'm blind here guys, can you help me find them?",1,Big Bang Theory,77,15
2759,Howard,11, Sorry.  Found â€˜em. ,1,Big Bang Theory,22,3
2760,Leonard,11, Oh great.,1,Big Bang Theory,10,2
2761,Howard,11," Sorry, don't you have a spare.",1,Big Bang Theory,31,6
2762,Leonard,11," Yeah, at home. ",1,Big Bang Theory,16,3
2763,Raj,11," Well if you leave now, you can be back before the gorillas rip the crap out of Charlton Heston. ",1,Big Bang Theory,97,19
2764,Howard,11," Unless Sheldon's there, in which case you'll be trapped forever in his whiny hyper neurotic snot-web. ",1,Big Bang Theory,103,16
2765,Leonard,11," Hi, Penny. I was wondering, is Sheldon still at the restaurant? Okay, that was very nice of you. Okay, gotta go, got kind of a full blown Chernobyl thing here, gotta go, bye.  He's home, I'm screwed. Ten and a half hours of apey blurriness. ",1,Big Bang Theory,242,45
2766,Raj,11, How about Lasic? ,1,Big Bang Theory,18,3
2767,Leonard,11, You want me to get eye surgery? ,1,Big Bang Theory,33,7
2768,Raj,11," Would you rather go back to the apartment and deal with Sheldon, or have a stranger carve out your corneas with a laser beam?",1,Big Bang Theory,126,24
2769,Howard,11, Well?,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
2770,Leonard,11, I'm thinking! ,1,Big Bang Theory,15,2
2772,Penny,11," Okay, nice and cosy, okay, I'll see you later.",1,Big Bang Theory,47,9
2773,Sheldon,11, Wait. Will you please rub this on my chest. ,1,Big Bang Theory,45,9
2774,Penny,11," Oh, Sheldon, can't you do that yourself?",1,Big Bang Theory,41,7
2775,Sheldon,11, Vaporub makes my hands smell funny. ,1,Big Bang Theory,37,6
2776,Penny,11, But Sheldon.,1,Big Bang Theory,13,2
2777,Sheldon,11," Please, please, please, please, please, please, please.",1,Big Bang Theory,56,7
2778,Penny,11, I can't believe I'm doing this. ,1,Big Bang Theory,33,6
2779,Sheldon,11," No, no, counter-clockwise or my chest hair mats. ",1,Big Bang Theory,50,8
2780,Penny,11, Sorry. ,1,Big Bang Theory,8,1
2781,Sheldon,11, Can you sing â€œSoft Kittyâ€ù. ,1,Big Bang Theory,32,5
2782,Penny,11, What?,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
2783,Sheldon,11, My mom used to sing it to me when I was sick.,1,Big Bang Theory,46,12
2784,Penny,11," I'm sorry, honey, I don't know it.",1,Big Bang Theory,35,7
2785,Sheldon,11," I'll teach you. â€œSoft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur, happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr purr purr.â€ù Now you. ",1,Big Bang Theory,119,20
2786,Penny,11," Soft kitty, warm kitty",1,Big Bang Theory,23,4
2787,Sheldon,11, Little ball of fur. Keep rubbing. ,1,Big Bang Theory,35,6
2788,Penny,11, Little ball of fur. ,1,Big Bang Theory,21,4
2790,Leonard,11," What do you see, what do you see.",1,Big Bang Theory,34,8
2791,Raj,11, The living room appears to be empty. ,1,Big Bang Theory,38,7
2792,Leonard,11," Okay, he must be in his bedroom. My spare glasses are in my bedroom, on my dresser, next to my Bat-signal. ",1,Big Bang Theory,108,21
2793,Howard,11, I'm not going in there.,1,Big Bang Theory,24,5
2794,Leonard,11, Raj?,1,Big Bang Theory,5,1
2795,Raj,11," No way, Jose. ",1,Big Bang Theory,15,3
2796,Leonard,11," Well I can't do it, I can't see anything. ",1,Big Bang Theory,43,9
2797,Howard,11," It's all right, wireless mini-cam and Bluetooth headset. We'll be your eyes. ",1,Big Bang Theory,78,12
2798,Leonard,11, Fine.,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
2799,Howard,11," One more thing. This is a subsonic impact sensor. If Sheldon gets out of bed and starts to walk, this device will register it and send a signal to the laptop. At that point, based on the geography of the apartment and the ambulatory speed of a sick Sheldon, you'll have seven seconds to get out, glasses or no glasses.",1,Big Bang Theory,319,60
2800,Leonard,11, Won't my footsteps set it off? ,1,Big Bang Theory,32,6
2801,Howard,11," No, you'll be on your hands and knees. Now you'll need to get the sensor as close as you can to Sheldon's room. ",1,Big Bang Theory,113,23
2802,Leonard,11," Well, how do I carry it if I'm on my hands and knees?",1,Big Bang Theory,54,13
2803,Howard,11, Stay low. Bear left. Now keep true.,1,Big Bang Theory,36,7
2804,Leonard,11, What? ,1,Big Bang Theory,7,1
2805,Howard,11, It means go straight.,1,Big Bang Theory,22,4
2806,Leonard,11, Then just say go straight. ,1,Big Bang Theory,28,5
2807,Howard,11," You don't stay go straight when you're giving bearings, you say keep true. ",1,Big Bang Theory,76,13
2808,Leonard,11, Alright  I just hit my head. ,1,Big Bang Theory,30,6
2809,Howard,11," Because you didn't keep true.  Okay, turn right. ",1,Big Bang Theory,50,8
2810,Raj,11, The the picture's breaking up. ,1,Big Bang Theory,32,5
2811,Howard,11," Angle your head to the right. A little more. A little more.  That's it, now just keep true. Alright, you're close enough to Sheldon's room, deploy the sensor. Now turn it on.",1,Big Bang Theory,175,32
2812,Leonard,11, It wasn't on? ,1,Big Bang Theory,15,3
2813,Howard,11, No.,1,Big Bang Theory,4,1
2814,Leonard,11, Then why did I have to crawl? ,1,Big Bang Theory,31,7
2815,Howard,11," Oh, I guess you didn't. ",1,Big Bang Theory,25,5
2816,Leonard,11," Okay, it's on.",1,Big Bang Theory,15,3
2817,Howard,11, Good. From this point forward you will have to crawl. ,1,Big Bang Theory,55,10
2818,Leonard,11, I know. ,1,Big Bang Theory,9,2
2819,Howard,11," Hang on, the sensor's picking up something, turn your head back.  ",1,Big Bang Theory,67,11
2820,Penny,11, You rat bastard. ,1,Big Bang Theory,18,3
2821,Howard,11, Told you the sensor would work. ,1,Big Bang Theory,33,6
2822,Leonard,11, Hi!,1,Big Bang Theory,4,1
2823,Penny,11, You deliberately stuck me with Sheldon. ,1,Big Bang Theory,41,6
2824,Leonard,11," Well, I had to, you see what he's like. ",1,Big Bang Theory,41,9
2825,Sheldon,11," Penny! Penny, I'm hungry. ",1,Big Bang Theory,27,4
2826,Penny,11," Uh, it's okay, sweetie, good news, Leonard's home!",1,Big Bang Theory,51,8
2827,Leonard,11, No! ,1,Big Bang Theory,5,1
2828,Penny,11," Here you go, good luck, bye.",1,Big Bang Theory,29,6
2829,Leonard,11, W-wait! ,1,Big Bang Theory,9,1
2830,Sheldon,11," Leonard, I'm hungry!",1,Big Bang Theory,21,3
2831,Leonard,11, Wait! Penny! Take me with you!  ,1,Big Bang Theory,33,6
2832,Sheldon,11, I want grilled cheese. ,1,Big Bang Theory,24,4
2833,Sheldon,11, Do you think Penny will come here and take care of us? ,1,Big Bang Theory,56,12
2834,Leonard,11, I don't think Penny's ever coming here again. ,1,Big Bang Theory,47,8
2835,Sheldon,11, I'm very congested. ,1,Big Bang Theory,21,3
2836,Leonard,11," Yeah, so?",1,Big Bang Theory,10,2
2837,Sheldon,11," Can you go to the kitchen, and get me the turkey baster labelled mucus.",1,Big Bang Theory,72,14
2838,Leonard,11," If I stand, I'll vomit. ",1,Big Bang Theory,25,5
2839,Sheldon,11," Under the sink, yellow Tupperware bowl. ",1,Big Bang Theory,41,6
2841,Sheldon,12, Here's the problem with teleportation.,1,Big Bang Theory,39,5
2842,Leonard,12, Lay it on me. ,1,Big Bang Theory,15,4
2843,Sheldon,12," Assuming the device could be invented which would identify the quantum state of matter of an individual in one location, and transmit that pattern to a distant location for reassembly, you would not have actually transported the individual. You would have destroyed him in one location, and recreated him in another.",1,Big Bang Theory,317,51
2844,Leonard,12, How about that. ,1,Big Bang Theory,17,3
2845,Sheldon,12," Personally, I would never use a transporter. Because the original Sheldon would have to be disintegrated in order to create a new Sheldon.",1,Big Bang Theory,139,23
2846,Leonard,12, Would the new Sheldon be in any way an improvement on the old Sheldon? ,1,Big Bang Theory,72,14
2847,Sheldon,12," No, he would be exactly the same. ",1,Big Bang Theory,35,7
2848,Leonard,12, That is a problem. ,1,Big Bang Theory,20,4
2849,Sheldon,12," So, you see it too.",1,Big Bang Theory,20,5
2853,Leonard,12," Graduate work, very impressive.",1,Big Bang Theory,32,4
2855,Sheldon,12," Not bad, I myself started graduate school at fourteen.",1,Big Bang Theory,55,9
2857,Leonard,12, Advantage Kim. ,1,Big Bang Theory,16,2
2860,Sheldon,12," Excuse me, that is my research, and it is by no means a dead end.",1,Big Bang Theory,66,15
2863,Leonard,12, Yes sir. ,1,Big Bang Theory,10,2
2864,Sheldon,12," You can count on us, we're on it. What the hell do you mean, dead end. ",1,Big Bang Theory,72,16
2866,Sheldon,12, I sense a disturbance in the force. ,1,Big Bang Theory,37,7
2867,Leonard,12," A bad feeling I have about this, mmm-hmmm. ",1,Big Bang Theory,44,8
2869,Leonard,12," So, Dennis, how long have you been in America.",1,Big Bang Theory,47,9
2871,Leonard,12," No kidding, you speak English really well.",1,Big Bang Theory,43,7
2873,Leonard,12, What are you talking about? ,1,Big Bang Theory,29,5
2875,Sheldon,12," He's not wrong. Alright, and this is my office.",1,Big Bang Theory,48,9
2877,Sheldon,12, Nope. Goodbye. ,1,Big Bang Theory,16,2
2878,Leonard,12," Come on, Sheldon, we've hardly shown him anything.",1,Big Bang Theory,51,8
2879,Sheldon,12," Oh, alright, this is my desk, these are my books, this is my door, please close it behind you. Goodbye. ",1,Big Bang Theory,105,20
2881,Sheldon,12," Keen observation, goodbye. ",1,Big Bang Theory,28,3
2883,Sheldon,12, Leonard.,1,Big Bang Theory,9,1
2884,Leonard,12," Huh, yeah? ",1,Big Bang Theory,12,2
2885,Sheldon,12, Get him out. ,1,Big Bang Theory,14,3
2886,Leonard,12," Come on, Dennis, I'll show you the rec centre, they've got nautilus equipment.",1,Big Bang Theory,79,13
2888,Leonard,12, Not heavy ones. ,1,Big Bang Theory,17,3
2890,Sheldon,12, You think I haven't considered it? You really think I haven't considered it? ,1,Big Bang Theory,78,13
2892,Sheldon,12, Get him out Leonard.,1,Big Bang Theory,21,4
2893,Leonard,12," Come on, Dennis, I'll show you the radiation lab.",1,Big Bang Theory,50,9
2895,Sheldon,12," Yes, in fact I am the youngest person ever to win it. ",1,Big Bang Theory,55,12
2897,Sheldon,12, Fourteen and a half.,1,Big Bang Theory,21,4
2899,Leonard,12," It's like looking into an obnoxious little mirror, isn't it? ",1,Big Bang Theory,62,10
2901,Penny,12," Mmm, this is really delicious, isn't it?  Still can't talk to me unless you're drunk, huh?  Oh, sweetie, you are so damaged. ",1,Big Bang Theory,126,22
2902,Howard,12," Hey, I'm damaged too. How about a hug for Howie? ",1,Big Bang Theory,50,10
2903,Penny,12," Sure. Raj, hug Howard. ",1,Big Bang Theory,24,4
2904,Sheldon,12, Uh-uh-uh. ,1,Big Bang Theory,11,1
2905,Leonard,12, Something you'd like to share? A tale of woe perhaps.,1,Big Bang Theory,54,10
2906,Sheldon,12," Fifteen years old. Dennis Kim is fifteen years old, and he's already correcting my work. Today I went from being Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart to you know, that other guy.",1,Big Bang Theory,166,29
2907,Howard,12, Antonio Salieri?,1,Big Bang Theory,17,2
2908,Sheldon,12," Oh, God, now even you're smarter than me.",1,Big Bang Theory,42,8
2909,Howard,12," You know, Sheldon, you don't have so many friends that you can afford to start insulting them. ",1,Big Bang Theory,96,17
2910,Leonard,12," Just eat, Sheldon, you'll feel better. ",1,Big Bang Theory,40,6
2911,Sheldon,12," Why waste food. In Texas when a cow goes dry they don't keep feeding it, they just take her out and shoot her between the eyes. ",1,Big Bang Theory,129,26
2912,Penny,12," I'm confused, did Sheldon stop giving milk? ",1,Big Bang Theory,45,7
2913,Leonard,12, You can't let this kid get to you. You always knew that someday someone would come along who was younger and smarter.,1,Big Bang Theory,118,22
2914,Sheldon,12," Yes, but I assumed I would have been dead hundreds of years, and that there would be an asterisk by his name because he would be a cyborg. ",1,Big Bang Theory,140,28
2915,Penny,12," So, you've got a bit of competition, I really don't see what the big deal is. ",1,Big Bang Theory,79,16
2916,Sheldon,12," Well of course you don't, you've never excelled at anything. ",1,Big Bang Theory,62,10
2917,Penny,12," I don't understand, exactly how did he get any friends in the first place? ",1,Big Bang Theory,76,14
2918,Howard,12, We liked Leonard.,1,Big Bang Theory,18,3
2919,Leonard,12," Well, what are you going to do, Sheldon, give up?",1,Big Bang Theory,50,10
2920,Sheldon,12," Yes. That's what a rational person does when his entire life's work is invalidated by a post-pubescent Asian wunderkind. He ceases his fruitless efforts, he donates his body to scientific research, and he waits to die. ",1,Big Bang Theory,220,36
2921,Penny,12," You know, I'm confused again, is he waiting, or do we get to shoot him between the eyes?",1,Big Bang Theory,89,18
2923,Sheldon,12, Hey.,1,Big Bang Theory,5,1
2924,Leonard,12, Hey.,1,Big Bang Theory,5,1
2925,Sheldon,12, I've decided you're right. My career is not over. ,1,Big Bang Theory,51,9
2926,Leonard,12, Great.,1,Big Bang Theory,7,1
2927,Sheldon,12," But, since the arrival of Dennis Kim has rendered my research pointless, I just have to find something else to focus on.",1,Big Bang Theory,121,22
2928,Leonard,12, Great.,1,Big Bang Theory,7,1
2929,Sheldon,12," So I've decided, I'm going to collaborate with you.",1,Big Bang Theory,52,9
2930,Leonard,12, Great. ,1,Big Bang Theory,8,1
2931,Sheldon,12," What exactly is it you do? I know you chatter on about it all the time, but I've never really paid attention.",1,Big Bang Theory,110,22
2932,Leonard,12," Okay, well, right now I'm designing an experiment to study the soft component of cosmic radiation at sea-level, but I really don't need any help. ",1,Big Bang Theory,147,25
2933,Sheldon,12," Oh, sure you do. Now, see, what's this here in the schematic, is that a laser array?",1,Big Bang Theory,85,17
2934,Leonard,12, Yes.,1,Big Bang Theory,5,1
2935,Sheldon,12, No. Hmmm. What happens if you use argon lasers instead of helium neon?,1,Big Bang Theory,71,13
2936,Leonard,12, It would blow up.,1,Big Bang Theory,18,4
2937,Sheldon,12, Are you sure? ,1,Big Bang Theory,15,3
2938,Leonard,12, Pretty sure.,1,Big Bang Theory,13,2
2939,Sheldon,12," Pretty sure's not very scientific, is this how you normally work, just hunches and guesses and stuff?",1,Big Bang Theory,102,17
2940,Leonard,12," Okay, Sheldon, I understand that you're going through a bit of a career crisis, you're searching for some other area where you can feel valuable and productive but I need to tell you something and I want you to listen carefully. ",1,Big Bang Theory,230,41
2941,Sheldon,12, Alright.,1,Big Bang Theory,9,1
2942,Leonard,12, Go away.,1,Big Bang Theory,9,2
2943,Sheldon,12," If you're concerned about sharing credit with me, you're name can go first I'm going. ",1,Big Bang Theory,87,15
2945,Howard,12," It's a small brown paper bag, Ma, I'm looking at it right now.  Why would I make that up, there's no ding-dong in it.  How are two ding-dongs tomorrow going to help me today? ",1,Big Bang Theory,176,34
2946,Sheldon,12," So, this is engineering, huh? ",1,Big Bang Theory,31,5
2947,Howard,12, I'll talk to you later. ,1,Big Bang Theory,25,5
2948,Sheldon,12," Engineering. Where the noble semi-skilled labourers execute the vision of those who think and dream. Hello, oompah-loompahs of science.",1,Big Bang Theory,136,19
2949,Howard,12," Sheldon, what are you doing here?",1,Big Bang Theory,34,6
2950,Sheldon,12, I just came by to say hello.,1,Big Bang Theory,29,7
2951,Howard,12," I've been at this lab for three years, you've never came by to say hello.",1,Big Bang Theory,74,15
2952,Sheldon,12," Well, up until now I've had better things to do. So, what are we making today? ",1,Big Bang Theory,80,16
2953,Howard,12, A small payload support structure for a European science experimental package that's going up on the next space shuttle. ,1,Big Bang Theory,122,19
2954,Sheldon,12," Really, how does it work?",1,Big Bang Theory,26,5
2955,Howard,12," When this is done, it will be attached to the payload bay, and the sensor apparatus will rest on it. ",1,Big Bang Theory,102,20
2956,Sheldon,12," Uh, huh. So it's a shelf? ",1,Big Bang Theory,27,6
2957,Howard,12," No, you don't understand, during acceleration it needs to stay perfectly level and provide yeah, okay, it's a shelf. ",1,Big Bang Theory,118,19
2958,Sheldon,12," Now, I notice you're using titanium, did you give any consideration to carbon nanotubes, they're lighter, cheaper and half twice the tensile strength.",1,Big Bang Theory,151,23
2959,Howard,12," Sheldon, there's a diploma in my office that says I have a masters in engineering.",1,Big Bang Theory,83,15
2960,Sheldon,12," And you also have a note from your mother that says I love you, bubbula. But neither of those is a cogent argument for titanium over nanotubes. ",1,Big Bang Theory,145,27
2961,Howard,12, Sheldon.,1,Big Bang Theory,9,1
2962,Sheldon,12, Yes.,1,Big Bang Theory,5,1
2963,Howard,12, Go away. ,1,Big Bang Theory,10,2
2964,Sheldon,12, Did Leonard tell you to say that? ,1,Big Bang Theory,35,7
2965,Howard,12," No, I thought of it all by myself. ",1,Big Bang Theory,36,8
2966,Sheldon,12, Huh. It can't be a coincidence. There must be some causal link I'm missing.,1,Big Bang Theory,76,14
2968,Raj,12, Go away. ,1,Big Bang Theory,10,2
2969,Sheldon,12, Curiouser and curiouser. ,1,Big Bang Theory,26,3
2971,Howard,12, Is he here? ,1,Big Bang Theory,13,3
2972,Leonard,12," If he were, I wouldn't be. ",1,Big Bang Theory,28,6
2973,Raj,12," Do you know what he did. He watched me work for ten minutes, and then started to design a simple piece of software that could replace me. ",1,Big Bang Theory,139,27
2974,Leonard,12, Is that even possible?,1,Big Bang Theory,23,4
2975,Raj,12," As it turns out, yes.",1,Big Bang Theory,22,5
2976,Howard,12," Something's got to be done about him, Leonard.",1,Big Bang Theory,47,8
2977,Leonard,12, Like what? He'll never be able to cope with the fact that some fifteen year-old kid is smarter and more accomplished than he is. ,1,Big Bang Theory,130,24
2978,Raj,12," Well, what if something were to happen to this boy so he was no longer a threat to Sheldon?",1,Big Bang Theory,92,19
2979,Howard,12, Then our problem would be solved. ,1,Big Bang Theory,35,6
2980,Leonard,12," Hang on, are we talking about murdering Dennis Kim? I'm not saying no. ",1,Big Bang Theory,72,13
2981,Howard,12," We don't have to go that far, there are other means available.",1,Big Bang Theory,63,12
2982,Raj,12, We can't send him back to North Korea. He knows how to get out. ,1,Big Bang Theory,65,14
2983,Howard,12, The only thing we need to do is make this Kim kid lose his focus.,1,Big Bang Theory,66,15
2984,Leonard,12," That won't happen, he's not interested in anything but physics.",1,Big Bang Theory,64,10
2985,Howard,12, What about biology? ,1,Big Bang Theory,21,3
2986,Leonard,12, What?,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
2987,Howard,12," You know, biology? The one thing that can completely derail a world class mind. ",1,Big Bang Theory,81,14
2988,Leonard,12," Howard, he's fifteen.",1,Big Bang Theory,22,3
2989,Howard,12," Yeah, so, when I was fifteen I met Denise Polmerry and my grade point average fell from a 5.0 to a 1.8. ",1,Big Bang Theory,105,22
2990,Raj,12, She was sleeping with you?,1,Big Bang Theory,27,5
2991,Howard,12," No, I just wasted a lot of time thinking about what it would be like if she did. ",1,Big Bang Theory,82,18
2992,Sheldon,12," Oh, good, you're all here. Look, I've decided that if the three of you drop whatever it is you're working on and join me, we could lick cold fusion in less than a decade, twelve years tops.  Go away?  Hmm. Could it be me? ",1,Big Bang Theory,223,44
2994,Penny,12," Oh, hey guys, what's up?",1,Big Bang Theory,25,5
2995,Howard,12, We need a hot fifteen year-old Asian girl with a thing for smart guys. ,1,Big Bang Theory,72,14
2996,Penny,12, What?,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
2997,Leonard,12," Howard, that's racist, any fifteen year-old girl will do the trick. ",1,Big Bang Theory,69,11
2998,Raj,12, It's possible she may have misunderstood us. ,1,Big Bang Theory,46,7
3001,Sheldon,12," No, no, please, come in. Yeah, I think you'll appreciate this, very exciting.",1,Big Bang Theory,78,13
3003,Sheldon,12," Something remarkable. Since my prospects for the Nobel Prize in physics have disappeared, thank you very much, I've decided to refocus my efforts and use my people skills to win the Nobel Peace Prize. Look, I'm going to solve the Middle-East Crisis by building an exact replica of Jerusalem in the middle of the Mexican desert. ",1,Big Bang Theory,329,56
3005,Sheldon,12," You know, it's like the baseball movie, build it and they will come. ",1,Big Bang Theory,70,13
3007,Sheldon,12, The Jewish people.,1,Big Bang Theory,19,3
3009,Sheldon,12," We'll make it nice, put out a spread. ",1,Big Bang Theory,39,8
3011,Sheldon,12," Of course he has, the oracle told us little Neo was the one. You can see the Matrix, can't you.",1,Big Bang Theory,96,20
3013,Sheldon,12," Ah, la-la-la, Hava Nagila. They'll come, they'll settle and I'll win the prize",1,Big Bang Theory,79,13
3015,Sheldon,12," I really don't understand your objections, Professor Goldfarb, why wouldn't the Senoran Desert make a perfectly good promised land?",1,Big Bang Theory,132,19
3017,Sheldon,12, We could call it Nuevo Cherusalem. ,1,Big Bang Theory,36,6
3019,Sheldon,12, Said Pharoah to Moses. ,1,Big Bang Theory,24,4
3021,Leonard,12, It's take your daughter to work day. ,1,Big Bang Theory,38,7
3023,Raj,12," Oh, yes. There was a very official email that was sent to everyone whose insurance files indicated they had daughters between the ages of 14 and 16. ",1,Big Bang Theory,150,27
3025,Howard,12, Smooth.,1,Big Bang Theory,8,1
3026,Raj,12, Thank you. ,1,Big Bang Theory,12,2
3028,Leonard,12," Okay, so we now have a socially awkward genius in a room full of attractive age-appropriate women. ",1,Big Bang Theory,100,17
3029,Howard,12, All he has to do now is hook up with one of them. ,1,Big Bang Theory,51,13
3030,Leonard,12, Does anyone else see the flaw in this plan?,1,Big Bang Theory,44,9
3031,Raj,12, We need a social catalyst.,1,Big Bang Theory,27,5
3032,Leonard,12, Like what? We can't get fifteen year-old girls drunk. ,1,Big Bang Theory,55,9
3033,Howard,12, Or can we?,1,Big Bang Theory,11,3
3034,Leonard,12," No, we can't. ",1,Big Bang Theory,15,3
3035,Howard,12, I don't think you mean we can't. I think you mean we shouldn't. ,1,Big Bang Theory,65,13
3036,Sheldon,12," Hey, Howard. You're a Jew. If there was another wailing wall, exactly like the one in Jerusalem, but close to taco stands and cheap prescription drugs, would you still be able to wail at it? Okay, it's definitely me. ",1,Big Bang Theory,218,39
3037,Leonard,12," Okay, we cannot leave this to chance, lets pick a girl, and figure out how to get her together with Dennis. ",1,Big Bang Theory,109,21
3038,Raj,12, Okay. How about that one.,1,Big Bang Theory,26,5
3039,Howard,12," Uh-uh. I know the type, cheerleader, student council, goes out with jocks, won't even look at anybody in the gifted programme. And if, after two years of begging, she does agree to go out with you, it turns out to be a set-up and you're in the back seat of your mom's car with your pants off while the whole football team laughs at you.",1,Big Bang Theory,337,65
3040,Raj,12, Are you crying?,1,Big Bang Theory,16,3
3041,Howard,12," No, I have allergies. ",1,Big Bang Theory,23,4
3042,Raj,12," Okay, uh, how about her? ",1,Big Bang Theory,26,5
3043,Leonard,12," Sure. If he wants to spend a couple of years doing her homework while she drinks herself into a stupor with non-fat White Russians, while you're the one holding her head out of the toilet while she's puking and telling you she wishes more guys were like you, and they she gets into Cornell because you wrote her essay for her, and you drive up to visit her one weekend and she acts like she doesn't even know you. ",1,Big Bang Theory,415,79
3044,Raj,12," Okay, so not her either. How about her?",1,Big Bang Theory,40,8
3045,Howard,12," Interesting, kind of pretty, a little chubby so probably low self-esteem. ",1,Big Bang Theory,75,11
3046,Leonard,12, I think that's our girl. One of us should go talk to her. ,1,Big Bang Theory,59,13
3047,Raj,12," I can't talk to her, you do it. ",1,Big Bang Theory,33,8
3048,Leonard,12," I can't just go up and talk to her. Howard, you talk to her. ",1,Big Bang Theory,62,14
3049,Howard,12," Oh no, she'll never go for the kid once she gets a peek at this. ",1,Big Bang Theory,66,15
3050,Raj,12," You know, if we were in India this would be simpler. Five minutes with her dad, twenty goats and a laptop and we'd be done.",1,Big Bang Theory,124,25
3051,Leonard,12," Well, we're not in India. ",1,Big Bang Theory,27,5
3052,Raj,12," Alright, why don't we do it your way then? We'll arrange for this girl to move in across the hall from Dennis so he can pathetically moon over her for months on end.",1,Big Bang Theory,166,33
3053,Leonard,12," Okay, that was uncalled for.",1,Big Bang Theory,29,5
3054,Raj,12," You started it, dude. ",1,Big Bang Theory,23,4
3056,Sheldon,12, Welcome Dennis Kim. ,1,Big Bang Theory,21,3
3058,Sheldon,12, Youngest till the cyborgs rise up! ,1,Big Bang Theory,36,6
3064,Leonard,12, The kid got a girl. ,1,Big Bang Theory,21,5
3065,Raj,12, Unbelievable.,1,Big Bang Theory,14,1
3066,Howard,12, Did anyone see how he did it?,1,Big Bang Theory,30,7
3067,Sheldon,12," Don't worry, I've got this. Ladies and Gentlemen, honoured daughters. While Mr Kim, by virtue of his youth and naivety, has fallen prey to the inexplicable need for human contact, let me step in and assure you that my research will go on uninterrupted, and that social relationships will continue to baffle and repulse me. Thank you. ",1,Big Bang Theory,335,57
3068,Howard,12, He's back.,1,Big Bang Theory,11,2
3069,Leonard,12," Yeah, mission accomplished. ",1,Big Bang Theory,29,3
3070,Raj,12," Forget the mission, how did that little yutz get a girl on his own?",1,Big Bang Theory,68,14
3071,Howard,12, I guess times have changed since we were young. Smart is the new sexy. ,1,Big Bang Theory,72,14
3072,Leonard,12," Well, why do we go home alone every night, we're still smart. ",1,Big Bang Theory,63,12
3073,Raj,12, Maybe we're too smart. So smart it's offputting. ,1,Big Bang Theory,50,8
3074,Howard,12," Yeah, let's go with that. ",1,Big Bang Theory,27,5
3076,Howard,12," Unbelievable. Components I built are on the International Space Station, and I get a ticket for launching a model rocket in the park. ",1,Big Bang Theory,135,23
3077,Leonard,12," I don't know if the ticket was so much for the launch as it was for you telling the policewoman â€œyou have to frisk me, I have a rocket in my pants.â€ù",1,Big Bang Theory,153,32
3078,Raj,12," Hey, look at that.  It's Dennis Kim.",1,Big Bang Theory,37,7
3079,Howard,12," Wow, I almost didn't recognise him.",1,Big Bang Theory,36,6
3080,Raj,12," You know, I kind of feel bad about what we did to him. ",1,Big Bang Theory,56,13
3081,Leonard,12," Yeah, we really ruined his life. ",1,Big Bang Theory,34,6
3082,Sheldon,12," Screw him, he was weak. ",1,Big Bang Theory,25,5
3084,Howard,13," Ooh, more details about the new Star Trek film. There's going to be a scene depicting Spock's birth. ",1,Big Bang Theory,102,18
3085,Raj,13, I'd be more interested in a scene depicting Spock's conception. ,1,Big Bang Theory,65,10
3086,Sheldon,13," Oh, please. For Vulcans, mating, or, if you will, Pon Farr, it's an extremely private matter.",1,Big Bang Theory,94,16
3087,Leonard,13," Still, I'd like to know the details. His mother was human, his father was Vulcan, they couldn't just conceive.",1,Big Bang Theory,111,19
3088,Howard,13, Maybe they had to go to a clinic. Imagine Spock's dad in a little room with a copy of pointy ears and shapely rears.,1,Big Bang Theory,117,24
3089,Raj,13," How come on Star Trek everybody's private parts are the same. No alien lady ever told Captain Kirk, hey, get your thing out of my nose. ",1,Big Bang Theory,137,26
3090,Penny,13," Hi, can you help me, I was writing an email and the A key got stuck. Now it's just going â€œaaaaaaaâ€ù.",1,Big Bang Theory,104,21
3091,Leonard,13, What did you spill on it?,1,Big Bang Theory,26,6
3092,Penny,13, Nothing. Diet coke. And yoghurt. A little nail polish. ,1,Big Bang Theory,56,9
3093,Leonard,13, I'll take a look at it. ,1,Big Bang Theory,25,6
3094,Howard,13," Gentlemen, switching to local nerd news. Fishman, Chen, Chowdry, McNair aren't fielding a team in the university physics bowl this year. ",1,Big Bang Theory,138,21
3095,Leonard,13," You're kidding, why not?",1,Big Bang Theory,25,4
3096,Howard,13," They formed a barbershop quartet, and got a gig playing Knotsbury Farm. ",1,Big Bang Theory,73,12
3097,Penny,13," Wow, so in your world, you're like, the cool guys. ",1,Big Bang Theory,52,10
3098,Howard,13, Recognise. ,1,Big Bang Theory,12,1
3099,Leonard,13," This is our year! With those guys out, the entire physics bowl will kneel before Zod. ",1,Big Bang Theory,87,16
3100,Penny,13, Zod?,1,Big Bang Theory,5,1
3101,Howard,13, Kryptonian villain. Long story.,1,Big Bang Theory,32,4
3102,Raj,13, Good story.  ,1,Big Bang Theory,14,2
3103,Sheldon,13, Well count me out.,1,Big Bang Theory,19,4
3104,Howard,13, What? Why?,1,Big Bang Theory,11,2
3105,Sheldon,13, You want me to use my intelligence in a tawdry competition? Would you ask Picasso to play Pictionary? Would you ask Noah Webster to play Boggle? Would you ask Jacques Cousteau to play Go Fish? ,1,Big Bang Theory,194,35
3106,Leonard,13," Come on, you need a four person team, we're four people. ",1,Big Bang Theory,58,11
3107,Sheldon,13," By that reasoning we should also play bridge, hold up a chuppah and enter the Olympic bobsled competition.",1,Big Bang Theory,107,18
3108,Penny,13, I want tickets to that please. ,1,Big Bang Theory,32,6
3109,Leonard,13," Sheldon, what, do I need to quote Spock's dying words to you.",1,Big Bang Theory,62,12
3110,Sheldon,13," No, don't. ",1,Big Bang Theory,12,2
3111,Leonard,13, The needs of the many.,1,Big Bang Theory,23,5
3112,Howard,13, Outweigh the needs of the few. ,1,Big Bang Theory,32,6
3113,Sheldon,13," Or the one. Dammit, I'll do it. ",1,Big Bang Theory,33,7
3115,Raj,13, Okay. First order of physics bowl business. We need a truly kick-ass team name. Suggestions.,1,Big Bang Theory,93,15
3116,Howard,13," How about the perpetual motion squad? It's beyond the laws of physics, plus a little heads up for the ladies. ",1,Big Bang Theory,111,20
3117,Leonard,13, The ladies?,1,Big Bang Theory,12,2
3118,Howard,13," Perpetual motion squad, we can go all night.",1,Big Bang Theory,45,8
3119,Raj,13, I like it.,1,Big Bang Theory,11,3
3120,Sheldon,13," I don't. Teams are traditionally named after fierce creatures, thus intimidating ones opponent.",1,Big Bang Theory,96,13
3121,Raj,13, Then we can be the Bengal Tigers.,1,Big Bang Theory,34,7
3122,Sheldon,13," Poor choice. Gram for gram, no animal exceeds the relative fighting strength of the army ant. ",1,Big Bang Theory,95,16
3123,Raj,13, Maybe so. But you can't incinerate a Bengal Tiger with a magnifying glass. ,1,Big Bang Theory,76,13
3124,Leonard,13, Let's put it to a vote. All those in favour.,1,Big Bang Theory,45,10
3125,Sheldon,13," Point of order. I move that any vote on team names should be unanimous. No man should be forced to emblazon his chest with the bengal tiger, when common sense dictates it should be an army ant. ",1,Big Bang Theory,195,37
3126,Leonard,13, Will the gentleman from the great state of denial yield for a question? ,1,Big Bang Theory,73,13
3127,Sheldon,13, I will yield.,1,Big Bang Theory,14,3
3128,Leonard,13," After we go through the exercise of an annoying series of votes, all of which the gentleman will lose, does he then intend to threaten to quit if he does not get his way?",1,Big Bang Theory,171,34
3129,Sheldon,13, He does. ,1,Big Bang Theory,10,2
3130,Leonard,13," I move we are the Army Ants, all those in favour?",1,Big Bang Theory,50,11
3132,Penny,13," Good afternoon, and welcome to today's physics bowl practice round. I'm Penny, and I'll be your host, because apparently I didn't have anything else to do on a Saturday afternoon, and isn't that just a little sad? Gentlemen, are you ready?",1,Big Bang Theory,240,41
3133,Leonard,13, Yes.,1,Big Bang Theory,5,1
3134,Sheldon,13, Of course. ,1,Big Bang Theory,12,2
3135,Howard,13, Fire away. ,1,Big Bang Theory,12,2
3136,Penny,13," You know, it's none of my business, but isn't a guy who can't speak in front of women going to hold you back a little?",1,Big Bang Theory,119,25
3137,Leonard,13," Oh, uh, he'll be okay once the women are mixed into the crowd. He only has a problem when they're one on one and smell nice.",1,Big Bang Theory,125,26
3138,Penny,13," Oh, thanks Raj, it's vanilla oil.",1,Big Bang Theory,34,6
3139,Leonard,13," I was actually the one who noticed, okay, let's just start. ",1,Big Bang Theory,61,11
3140,Penny,13," Okay, the first question is on the topic of optics. What is the shortest light pulse ever produced? Dr Cooper.",1,Big Bang Theory,111,20
3141,Sheldon,13," And of course, the answer is 130 adoseconds.",1,Big Bang Theory,45,8
3142,Penny,13, That is correct.,1,Big Bang Theory,17,3
3143,Leonard,13, I knew that too.,1,Big Bang Theory,17,4
3144,Penny,13," Good for you, sweetie. Okay, next question. What is the quantum mechanical effect used to encode data on hard disk drives? Howard.",1,Big Bang Theory,131,22
3145,Sheldon,13," And of course, the answer is giant magneto resistance.",1,Big Bang Theory,55,9
3146,Penny,13, Right. ,1,Big Bang Theory,8,1
3147,Howard,13," Hey, I buzzed in. ",1,Big Bang Theory,19,4
3148,Sheldon,13," But I answered, it's called teamwork. ",1,Big Bang Theory,39,6
3149,Howard,13, Don't you think I should answer the engineering questions? I am an engineer.,1,Big Bang Theory,77,13
3150,Sheldon,13, By that logic I should answer all the anthropology questions because I'm a mammal. ,1,Big Bang Theory,84,14
3151,Leonard,13, Just ask another one.,1,Big Bang Theory,22,4
3152,Penny,13, Okay. What artificial satellite has seen glimpses of Einsteins predicted frame dragging? ,1,Big Bang Theory,90,12
3153,Sheldon,13, And of course it's Gravity Probe B.,1,Big Bang Theory,36,7
3154,Leonard,13," Sheldon, you have to let somebody else answer. ",1,Big Bang Theory,48,8
3155,Sheldon,13, Why? ,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
3156,Penny,13, Because it's polite.,1,Big Bang Theory,21,3
3157,Sheldon,13, What do manners have to do with it? This is war. Were the Romans polite when they salted the ground of Carthage to make sure nothing would ever grow again?,1,Big Bang Theory,156,30
3158,Penny,13," Leonard, you said I only had to ask questions. ",1,Big Bang Theory,48,9
3159,Sheldon,13," The objective of the competition is to give correct answers, if I know them, why shouldn't I give them? ",1,Big Bang Theory,105,19
3160,Howard,13, Some of us might have the correct answers too. ,1,Big Bang Theory,48,9
3161,Sheldon,13," Oh please, you don't even have a PhD. ",1,Big Bang Theory,39,8
3162,Howard,13," Alright, that's it.",1,Big Bang Theory,20,3
3163,Leonard,13," Howard, sit down.",1,Big Bang Theory,18,3
3164,Howard,13, Okay. ,1,Big Bang Theory,7,1
3165,Leonard,13, maybe we should take a little break.,1,Big Bang Theory,37,7
3166,Sheldon,13," Good idea, I need my wrist brace, all this button pushing is aggravating my old Nintendo injury. ",1,Big Bang Theory,98,17
3167,Howard,13, I agree.,1,Big Bang Theory,9,2
3168,Penny,13, What did he say? ,1,Big Bang Theory,18,4
3169,Howard,13, He compared Sheldon to a disposable feminine cleansing product one might use on a summer's eve. ,1,Big Bang Theory,97,16
3170,Penny,13," Yeah, and the bag it came in. ",1,Big Bang Theory,31,7
3172,Sheldon,13," Leonard, excellent, I want to show you something.",1,Big Bang Theory,50,8
3173,Leonard,13," Can it wait, I need to talk to you.",1,Big Bang Theory,36,9
3174,Sheldon,13," Just look. I've designed the perfect uniforms for our team. The colours are based on Star Trek, the original series. The three of you will wear support red, and I will wear command gold. ",1,Big Bang Theory,188,34
3175,Leonard,13, Why do they say AA? ,1,Big Bang Theory,21,5
3176,Sheldon,13, Army Ants. ,1,Big Bang Theory,12,2
3177,Leonard,13, Isn't that confusing? AA might mean something else to certain people. ,1,Big Bang Theory,71,11
3178,Sheldon,13, Why would a physics bowl team be called anodised aluminium?,1,Big Bang Theory,60,10
3179,Leonard,13," No, I meant. never mind. Hey, check it out. I got you a Batman cookie jar!",1,Big Bang Theory,75,16
3180,Sheldon,13," Oh neat, what's the occasion?",1,Big Bang Theory,30,5
3181,Leonard,13," Well, you're a friend, and you like Batman, and cookies, and you're off the team. ",1,Big Bang Theory,83,15
3182,Sheldon,13, What?,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
3183,Leonard,13," Howard, Raj and I just had a team meeting. ",1,Big Bang Theory,44,9
3184,Sheldon,13, No you didn't.,1,Big Bang Theory,15,3
3185,Leonard,13," Yes we did, I just came from it.",1,Big Bang Theory,33,8
3186,Sheldon,13," Okay, I don't know where you just came from, but it couldn't have been a team meeting because I'm on the team and I wasn't there, ergo the team did not meet. ",1,Big Bang Theory,159,32
3187,Leonard,13," Okay, let me try it this way, uh, I was at a coffee klatch with a couple of friends and one thing led to another and it turns out you're off the team. ",1,Big Bang Theory,152,33
3188,Sheldon,13, Why?,1,Big Bang Theory,5,1
3189,Leonard,13, Because you're taking all the fun out of it.,1,Big Bang Theory,45,9
3190,Sheldon,13," Well, I'm sorry, is the winner of the physics bowl the team that has the most fun?",1,Big Bang Theory,83,17
3191,Leonard,13," Okay, let me try it this way, you're annoying and no-one wants to play with you any more. ",1,Big Bang Theory,91,18
3192,Sheldon,13," I see. Well. At this point I should inform you that I intend to form my own team and destroy the molecular bonds that bind your very matter together, and reduce the resulting particulate chaos to tears.",1,Big Bang Theory,203,37
3193,Leonard,13, Thanks for the heads up. ,1,Big Bang Theory,26,5
3194,Sheldon,13, You're welcome. One more thing.,1,Big Bang Theory,32,5
3195,Leonard,13, Yes.,1,Big Bang Theory,5,1
3196,Sheldon,13," It's on, bitch. ",1,Big Bang Theory,17,3
3198,Howard,13, So who'd he get to be on his team.,1,Big Bang Theory,35,9
3199,Leonard,13," He won't say. He just smiles, and eats macaroons out of his bat jar. ",1,Big Bang Theory,70,14
3200,Raj,13," He's using psychological warfare. We must reply in kind. I say we wait until he looks at us, then laugh like, yes, you are a smart and strong competitor, but we are also smart and strong and we have a reasonable chance of defeating you. ",1,Big Bang Theory,238,45
3201,Leonard,13, How exactly would that laugh go? ,1,Big Bang Theory,34,6
3202,Raj,13, Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee!,1,Big Bang Theory,29,7
3203,Howard,13," That sounds more like, we are a tall thin woman who wants to make a coat out of your Dalmatians. ",1,Big Bang Theory,98,20
3204,Leonard,13," Guys, let's remember that Sheldon is still our friend and my room mate.",1,Big Bang Theory,72,13
3205,Howard,13, So?,1,Big Bang Theory,4,1
3206,Leonard,13," So nothing, let's destroy him. ",1,Big Bang Theory,32,5
3207,Sheldon,13, Gentlemen.,1,Big Bang Theory,11,1
3208,Raj,13, Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee!,1,Big Bang Theory,29,7
3209,Howard,13," Okay, we're going to need a strong fourth for our team.",1,Big Bang Theory,56,11
3210,Raj,13," You know who's apparently very smart, is the girl who played TV's Blossom. She got a PhD in neuroscience or something. ",1,Big Bang Theory,120,21
3211,Leonard,13," Raj, we're not getting TV's Blossom to join our physics bowl team. ",1,Big Bang Theory,68,12
3212,Raj,13, How about the girl from the Wonder Years? ,1,Big Bang Theory,43,8
3213,Howard,13," Gentlemen, I believe I've found the solution to all our problems. ",1,Big Bang Theory,67,11
3214,Leonard,13, We can't ask Leslie Winkle.,1,Big Bang Theory,28,5
3215,Raj,13, Why? Because you slept together and when she was done with you she discarded you like last night's chutney? ,1,Big Bang Theory,109,19
3216,Leonard,13, Yes. ,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
3217,Howard,13, Sometimes you've got to take one for the team.,1,Big Bang Theory,47,9
3218,Raj,13," Yeah. Sack up, dude. ",1,Big Bang Theory,22,4
3219,Leonard,13," Fine. Here I go, taking one for the team. In the sack. Hey Leslie.",1,Big Bang Theory,67,14
3221,Leonard,13," Leslie, I have a question for you, and it might be a little awkward, you know, given that I",1,Big Bang Theory,92,19
3222,Howard,13, Hit that thang. ,1,Big Bang Theory,17,3
3224,Leonard,13," There's not? Gee, cos it sure sounds like there should be. ",1,Big Bang Theory,60,11
3226,Leonard,13," That's all very comforting, but if it's okay, I'd like to get on with my question now.",1,Big Bang Theory,87,17
3228,Leonard,13, We are entering the physics bowl and we need a fourth for our team.,1,Big Bang Theory,68,14
3230,Howard,13," Dilepton, schmilepton, we need you. ",1,Big Bang Theory,37,5
3232,Howard,13," Well, we tried. Just have to face Sheldon mano-e-mano-e-mano. A-mano. ",1,Big Bang Theory,71,10
3234,Howard,13, Yes.,1,Big Bang Theory,5,1
3236,Leonard,13, She's in. ,1,Big Bang Theory,11,2
3238,Penny,13," So, how do you feel? Nice and loose? Come to play? Got your game face on?  Are you ready?",1,Big Bang Theory,90,19
3239,Leonard,13," Oh, yeah. You know you don't have to stay for the whole thing. ",1,Big Bang Theory,64,13
3240,Penny,13," Oh, no, no, I want to. It sounds really interesting. ",1,Big Bang Theory,54,10
3241,Sheldon,13, Gentlemen.,1,Big Bang Theory,11,1
3242,Leonard,13, Sheldon.,1,Big Bang Theory,9,1
3243,Howard,13, Sheldon. ,1,Big Bang Theory,10,1
3244,Raj,13, Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee.,1,Big Bang Theory,33,8
3245,Penny,13, Sheldon. I'm just going to sit down. ,1,Big Bang Theory,38,7
3246,Leonard,13," So, is that your team.",1,Big Bang Theory,23,5
3247,Sheldon,13," Actually, I don't need a team, I could easily defeat you single-handedly. But the rules require four, so may I introduce, the third floor janitor, he lady from the lunchroom, and, my Spanish is not good, either her son or her butcher. And what about your team? What rat have you recruited to the SS Sinking Ship?",1,Big Bang Theory,313,57
3249,Sheldon,13, Leslie Winkle? ,1,Big Bang Theory,16,2
3251,Sheldon,13," Yes, well, I'm polymerised tree sap and you're non-organic adhesive so, whatever verbal projectile you launch in my direction is reflected off of me, returns on its original trajectory, and adheres to you. ",1,Big Bang Theory,207,33
3254,Leonard,13, Here's your tee-shirt.  ,1,Big Bang Theory,25,3
3256,Leonard,13," No, it stands for Perpetual Motion Squad. ",1,Big Bang Theory,43,7

3298,Sheldon,13, How do you know anything about physics?,1,Big Bang Theory,40,7
3300,Sheldon,13," Well that's a delightful little story, but our arrangement was that you sit here and not say anything, I answer the questions.",1,Big Bang Theory,127,22

3316,Leonard,13," Hang on. Sheldon, is proving that you are single-handedly smarter than everyone else so important that you would rather lose by yourself than win as part of a team. ",1,Big Bang Theory,166,29

3324,Sheldon,13," That trophy is meaningless, I forfeited, therefore you did not win. ",1,Big Bang Theory,69,11
3325,Leonard,13, I know someone who would disagree.,1,Big Bang Theory,35,6
3326,Sheldon,13, Who?,1,Big Bang Theory,5,1
3327,Leonard,13," My Physics Bowl Trophy!  â€œLeonard is so smart, Sheldon who?â€ù",1,Big Bang Theory,65,10
3328,Sheldon,13, Alright that is very immature.,1,Big Bang Theory,31,5

3341,Leonard,13," Wait, I don't think it's Shatner.",1,Big Bang Theory,34,6

3350,Raj,14, What did they give you?,1,Big Bang Theory,24,5
3351,Sheldon,14, Turkey and roast beef with swiss and lettuce on wholewheat. It's the right ingredients but in the wrong order. In a proper sandwich the cheese is adjacent to the bread to create a moisture barrier against the lettuce. They might as well have dragged this thing through a car wash. ,1,Big Bang Theory,282,50

3357,Raj,14," Boy, Sophie could have used a time machine in that movie. Did you see it, it's rough. ",1,Big Bang Theory,87,17
3358,Howard,14," Oh, that's cool.",1,Big Bang Theory,17,3
3359,Leonard,14, Uh-huh.,1,Big Bang Theory,8,1
3360,Raj,14, It's only $800?,1,Big Bang Theory,16,3
3361,Leonard,14, Yeah. And that's my bid.,1,Big Bang Theory,25,5
3362,Sheldon,14, You bid $800.,1,Big Bang Theory,14,3
3363,Leonard,14," It was a spur of the moment thing, I figured it would go for thousands and I just wanted to be a part of it. ",1,Big Bang Theory,110,25
3364,Sheldon,14, There's only 30 seconds left in the auction.,1,Big Bang Theory,45,8
3365,Howard,14, Do you have $800?,1,Big Bang Theory,18,4
3366,Leonard,14, Not to blow on a miniature time machine. ,1,Big Bang Theory,42,8
3367,Howard,14," Don't worry, the way these things work there's people waiting â€˜til the last second to bid, and then they swoop in and get it, it's called sniping.",1,Big Bang Theory,149,27

3383,Howard,14, You lucky duck. ,1,Big Bang Theory,17,3
3384,Sheldon,14," I wonder why no-one else bid, this is a classic piece of sci-fi movie memorabilia. ",1,Big Bang Theory,84,15
3385,Leonard,14," Yeah, I know, I still can't afford it. ",1,Big Bang Theory,40,8
3386,Howard,14, Why don't we share it? We'll each put in two hundred bucks and we'll take turns having it in our homes.,1,Big Bang Theory,104,21
3387,Raj,14, A time share time machine? I'm in. Sheldon?,1,Big Bang Theory,44,8
3388,Sheldon,14, Need you ask? But I still don't understand why no-one else bid. ,1,Big Bang Theory,65,12
3390,Sheldon,14, I understand why no-one else bid. ,1,Big Bang Theory,35,6
3392,Raj,14, Did the listing actually say miniature?,1,Big Bang Theory,40,6
3393,Leonard,14, I just assumed. Who sells a full sized time machine for $800?,1,Big Bang Theory,62,12
3394,Sheldon,14," In a venn diagram, that would be an individual located within the intersection of the sets â€œno longer want my time machineâ€ù and â€œneed $800â€ù.",1,Big Bang Theory,149,25
3395,Howard,14," It's actually a tremendous bargain, even with shipping it works out to less than four dollars a pound. ",1,Big Bang Theory,104,18
3396,Raj,14, Cocktain shrimp are $12.50.,1,Big Bang Theory,28,4
3397,Leonard,14, How are we going to get it upstairs? ,1,Big Bang Theory,38,8
3398,Howard,14, If we take the dish off it might fit in the elevator. ,1,Big Bang Theory,55,12
3399,Leonard,14, Yes but the elevator's been broken for two years. ,1,Big Bang Theory,51,9
3400,Sheldon,14," I've been meaning to ask you, do you think we should make a call about that? ",1,Big Bang Theory,78,16
3401,Howard,14," Not necessary, I have a masters in engineering, I remotely repair satellites on a regular basis. I troubleshoot space shuttle payloads. When the Mars rover started pulling to the left I performed a front end alignment from 62 million miles away.  No, that baby's broken. ",1,Big Bang Theory,272,45
3403,Leonard,14," Come on, guys, push. ",1,Big Bang Theory,22,4
3404,Howard,14, If I push any harder I'm going to give birth to my colon. ,1,Big Bang Theory,59,13
3405,Raj,14," I can't feel my fingers, hurry up. ",1,Big Bang Theory,36,7
3406,Sheldon,14," It's the same amount of work no matter how fast you go, basic physics.",1,Big Bang Theory,71,14
3407,Raj,14, Sheldon?,1,Big Bang Theory,9,1
3408,Sheldon,14, Yeah. ,1,Big Bang Theory,7,1
3409,Raj,14," If my fingers ever work again, I've got a job for the middle one. ",1,Big Bang Theory,67,14
3410,Penny,14," Oh, hey guys.",1,Big Bang Theory,14,3
3411,Leonard,14," Uh, hi Penny.  Take a break, guys! ",1,Big Bang Theory,36,7
3412,Penny,14, What are you doing?,1,Big Bang Theory,20,4
3413,Leonard,14," Oh, just, you know, moving something upstairs. ",1,Big Bang Theory,48,7
3414,Penny,14, What is it?,1,Big Bang Theory,12,3
3415,Leonard,14," It's you know, time machine. ",1,Big Bang Theory,30,5
3416,Penny,14," Yeah, okay, neat, but I really got to get to work, so.",1,Big Bang Theory,55,12
3417,Leonard,14," Uh, just give us a few minutes.",1,Big Bang Theory,32,7
3418,Penny,14," I don't have a few minutes, I'm running really late.",1,Big Bang Theory,53,10
3419,Sheldon,14," Then I have a simple solution, go up to the roof, hop over to the next building, there's a small gap, don't look down if you're subject to vertigo, and use their stairwell. ",1,Big Bang Theory,174,33
3420,Penny,14," You're joking, right?",1,Big Bang Theory,22,3
3421,Sheldon,14," Oh, I never joke when it comes to vertigo. ",1,Big Bang Theory,44,9
3422,Penny,14," Damn, okay, I'll just take the roof. ",1,Big Bang Theory,38,7
3423,Leonard,14," Hey, if you wait for us to set up the time machine, I can drop you off at work yesterday. Time travel joke, it's not never mind. ",1,Big Bang Theory,130,27
3424,Sheldon,14," For what it's worth, I thought it was humorous. ",1,Big Bang Theory,49,9
3425,Leonard,14," Let's just do this. Guys, ready to push?",1,Big Bang Theory,41,8
3426,Raj,14, In a minute. Howard stepped outside to throw up. ,1,Big Bang Theory,50,9
3428,Sheldon,14, I don't know what you were worried about. I think it really works in the room.,1,Big Bang Theory,79,16
3429,Leonard,14, Yeah. It is by far the coolest thing I have ever owned. ,1,Big Bang Theory,57,12
3430,Sheldon,14," The exact time machine that carried actor Rod Taylor from Victorian England into the post-apocalyptic future, which society had splintered into two factions, the sub-terranean Morlocks, who survived by feasting on the flesh of the gentle surface dwelling Eloy. ",1,Big Bang Theory,262,39
3431,Howard,14, Talk about your chick magnets. ,1,Big Bang Theory,32,5
3432,Raj,14," Oh yeah. The guy who lives next to me is always like, I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony, I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony. But wait until I tell him, I've got a time machine on my balcony. Stuff that in your speedos, Jacuzzi Bob!",1,Big Bang Theory,225,47
3433,Sheldon,14," Gentlemen, I know we said we'd take turns, but I think you'd agree that practicality dictates it remain here. ",1,Big Bang Theory,111,19
3434,Howard,14," You can't just keep it here, what if I meet a girl and say, â€œyou wanna come up and see my time machine, it's at my friends house,â€ù how lame is that? ",1,Big Bang Theory,154,32
3435,Raj,14, He's got a point.,1,Big Bang Theory,18,4
3436,Sheldon,14," Alright, I think we're going to need some ground rules, in addition to the expected no shoes in the time machine and no eating in the time machine, I propose that we add pants must be worn at all times in the time machine. ",1,Big Bang Theory,224,44
3437,Leonard,14, Seconded. ,1,Big Bang Theory,11,1
3438,Howard,14, I was going to put down a towel. ,1,Big Bang Theory,34,8
3439,Raj,14, I still want it on my balcony. I say we move it on a bi-monthly basis. ,1,Big Bang Theory,72,16
3440,Leonard,14, That sounds fair.,1,Big Bang Theory,18,3
3441,Sheldon,14," Hold on. Bi-monthly is an ambiguous term, do you mean move it every other month, or twice a month? ",1,Big Bang Theory,100,19
3442,Raj,14, Twice a month.,1,Big Bang Theory,15,3
3443,Sheldon,14, Then no. ,1,Big Bang Theory,10,2
3444,Raj,14," Okay, every other month.",1,Big Bang Theory,25,4
3445,Sheldon,14, No. ,1,Big Bang Theory,5,1
3446,Leonard,14," Sheldon, you can't be selfish, we all paid for it, so it belongs to all of us. Now out of the way so I can sit in my time machine.  Okay, I am setting the dials for March 10th, 1876. ",1,Big Bang Theory,184,40
3447,Howard,14," Good choice, Alexander Graham Bell invents the telephone and calls out for Dr Watson.",1,Big Bang Theory,86,14
3448,Sheldon,14," Wait a minute, I'd want to see that too. ",1,Big Bang Theory,42,9
3449,Leonard,14," So, when it's your turn you can.",1,Big Bang Theory,33,7
3450,Sheldon,14," But if we all go back to the same point in time, Bell's lab is going to get very crowded, he'll know something's up. ",1,Big Bang Theory,118,24
3451,Raj,14," Also, since the time machine doesn't move in space, you'll end up in 1876 Pasadena. ",1,Big Bang Theory,85,15
3452,Howard,14," And even if you can make it to Boston, what are you going to do, knock on the door and say to Mrs Bell, â€œhey Mrs Bell, big fan of your husband, can I come in and watch him invent the telephone?â€ù",1,Big Bang Theory,199,42
3453,Raj,14," Mrs Bell was deaf, she's not even going to hear you knock. ",1,Big Bang Theory,60,12
3454,Sheldon,14," Oh, I have a solution, first go into the future and obtain a cloaking device.",1,Big Bang Theory,78,15
3455,Raj,14," Ooh, how far into the future?",1,Big Bang Theory,30,6
3456,Sheldon,14," If I remember correctly, Captain Kirk will steal a cloaking device from the Romulans on Stardate 5027.3, which will be January 10th 2328 by pre-federation reckoning.",1,Big Bang Theory,166,26
3457,Leonard,14," Okay, I am setting the dials for January 10th, 2328. Here we go into the future.  That was fun. ",1,Big Bang Theory,97,19
3458,Raj,14, My turn.,1,Big Bang Theory,9,2
3459,Penny,14," Okay, first of all, what you call a gap was nearly three feet wide, I slipped and skinned my knee.",1,Big Bang Theory,99,20
3460,Leonard,14, Are you okay?,1,Big Bang Theory,14,3
3461,Penny,14," Zzz-zz-zz-zz! Second of all, the door to the stairwell of the other building was locked, so I had to go down the fire escape which ends on the third floor, forcing me to crawl through the window of a lovely Armenian family, who insisted I stay for lunch. ",1,Big Bang Theory,256,48
3462,Leonard,14, That doesn't sound too bad.,1,Big Bang Theory,28,5
3463,Penny,14," It was eight courses of lamb, and they tried to fix me up with their son.",1,Big Bang Theory,74,16
3464,Leonard,14, Sorry.,1,Big Bang Theory,7,1
3465,Penny,14," Not done. By the time I finally got to work, they'd given my shift away. Yeah, that's right, I've lost an entire day's pay thanks to this this",1,Big Bang Theory,143,28
3466,Sheldon,14, Time machine. ,1,Big Bang Theory,15,2
3467,Leonard,14," The lights flash and the dish spins, you wanna try it?",1,Big Bang Theory,55,11
3468,Penny,14," No! I don't want to try it, my God, you are grown men, how could you waste your lives with these stupid toys and costumes and comic books and and now that that",1,Big Bang Theory,160,33
3469,Sheldon,14," Again, time machine. ",1,Big Bang Theory,22,3
3470,Penny,14," Oh please, it's not a time machine, if anything it looks like something Elton John would drive through the Everglades.",1,Big Bang Theory,119,20
3471,Sheldon,14, It only moves in time. It would be worse than useless in a swamp. ,1,Big Bang Theory,67,14
3472,Penny,14," Pathetic. All of you, completely pathetic.  ",1,Big Bang Theory,45,6
3473,Raj,14, My turn! ,1,Big Bang Theory,10,2
3475,Sheldon,14," Leonard, it's two in the morning. ",1,Big Bang Theory,35,6
3476,Leonard,14, So?,1,Big Bang Theory,4,1
3477,Sheldon,14, So it's my turn. Why did you set it for the day before yesterday?,1,Big Bang Theory,66,14
3478,Leonard,14, Because I want to go back and keep myself from getting a time machine.,1,Big Bang Theory,71,14
3479,Sheldon,14," You can't. If you were to prevent yourself from buying it in the past, you would not have it available in the present to travel back and stop yourself from buying it, ergo you would still have it. This is a classic rookie time travel mistake. ",1,Big Bang Theory,244,46
3480,Leonard,14, Can I go back and prevent you from explaining that to me?,1,Big Bang Theory,58,12
3481,Sheldon,14," Same paradox. If you were to travel back in time and, say, knock me unconscious, you would not then have the conversation that irritated you, motivating you to go back and knock me unconscious. ",1,Big Bang Theory,195,34
3482,Leonard,14, What if I knocked you unconscious right now? ,1,Big Bang Theory,46,8
3483,Sheldon,14, It won't change the past. ,1,Big Bang Theory,27,5
3484,Leonard,14, But it would make the present so much nicer. ,1,Big Bang Theory,46,9
3485,Sheldon,14, Are you upset about something? ,1,Big Bang Theory,32,5
3486,Leonard,14, What was your first clue?,1,Big Bang Theory,26,5
3487,Sheldon,14," Well, it was a number of things. First the late hour, then your demeanour seems very low energy, plus your irritability",1,Big Bang Theory,120,21
3488,Leonard,14, Yes I'm upset. ,1,Big Bang Theory,16,3
3489,Sheldon,14, Oh! I don't usually pick up on those things. Good for me. ,1,Big Bang Theory,59,12
3490,Leonard,14," Yeah, good for you. ",1,Big Bang Theory,21,4
3491,Sheldon,14," Oh, wait. Did you want to talk about what's bothering you? ",1,Big Bang Theory,60,11
3492,Leonard,14, I don't know. Maybe.,1,Big Bang Theory,21,4
3493,Sheldon,14," Wow, I'm on fire tonight. ",1,Big Bang Theory,27,5
3494,Leonard,14," Uh, here's the thing. Girls like Penny never end up with guys who own time machines. ",1,Big Bang Theory,86,16
3495,Sheldon,14, I disagree. Your inability to successfully woo Penny long predates your acquisition of the time machine. That failure clearly stands on its own.,1,Big Bang Theory,145,23
3496,Leonard,14, Thanks for pointing it out.,1,Big Bang Theory,28,5
3497,Sheldon,14," In addition, your premise is flawed. In the original film, Rod Taylor got Yvette Mimeaux with that very time machine. In Back to the Future, Marty McFly got the opportunity to hook up with his extremely attractive young mother. ",1,Big Bang Theory,229,39
3498,Leonard,14, Those are movies.,1,Big Bang Theory,18,3
3499,Sheldon,14, Well of course they're movies. Were you expecting me to come up with an example involving a real life time machine? That's absurd. ,1,Big Bang Theory,132,23
3501,Leonard,14," Come on, guys, push. ",1,Big Bang Theory,22,4
3502,Howard,14, If I push any harder I'm going to give birth to my colon. ,1,Big Bang Theory,59,13
3503,Penny,14," Oh, hey guys.",1,Big Bang Theory,14,3
3504,Leonard,14," Uh, hi Penny.  Take a break, guys! ",1,Big Bang Theory,36,7
3505,Penny,14, What are you doing?,1,Big Bang Theory,20,4
3506,Leonard,14," Oh, just, you know, moving a time machine. ",1,Big Bang Theory,44,8
3507,Penny,14," Yeah, okay, neat, but I really got to get to work, so.",1,Big Bang Theory,55,12
3508,Leonard,14, No problem.  Hang on. ,1,Big Bang Theory,23,4
3509,Penny,14," But, what about your time machine.",1,Big Bang Theory,35,6
3510,Leonard,14, Some things are more important than toys. ,1,Big Bang Theory,43,7
3511,Penny,14," Oh, I'm scared. ",1,Big Bang Theory,17,3
3512,Leonard,14," Don't worry baby, I've got you.",1,Big Bang Theory,32,6
3513,Penny,14," Oh, Leonard. ",1,Big Bang Theory,14,2
3514,Sheldon,14, It's still my turn.,1,Big Bang Theory,20,4
3516,Sheldon,14, What are you doing?,1,Big Bang Theory,20,4
3517,Leonard,14, I'm packing up all my collectibles and taking them down to the comic book store to sell. ,1,Big Bang Theory,90,17
3518,Sheldon,14, Well is that really necessary. If you need money you can always sell blood. And semen. ,1,Big Bang Theory,88,16
3519,Leonard,14, It's not about money.,1,Big Bang Theory,22,4
3520,Raj,14, We brought food.,1,Big Bang Theory,17,3
3521,Howard,14," Lox and bagels, the breakfast of time travellers.",1,Big Bang Theory,50,8
3522,Leonard,14," Terrific, does anyone want to buy my share of the time machine?",1,Big Bang Theory,64,12
3523,Raj,14, Why?,1,Big Bang Theory,5,1
3524,Leonard,14, Because I don't want it any more. ,1,Big Bang Theory,35,7
3525,Howard,14, Why?,1,Big Bang Theory,5,1
3526,Leonard,14, Just personal reasons. ,1,Big Bang Theory,24,3
3527,Sheldon,14, My spidey-sense tells me this has something to do with Penny. ,1,Big Bang Theory,63,11
3528,Leonard,14," Look, do you want to buy me out or not?",1,Big Bang Theory,40,10
3529,Raj,14," I'll give you a hundred dollars, which will make me half owner, and we'll put it on my balcony. ",1,Big Bang Theory,97,19
3530,Howard,14," Screw his balcony, I'll give you a hundred and twenty and we'll put it in my garage. ",1,Big Bang Theory,86,17
3531,Leonard,14, I paid two hundred dollars for my share.,1,Big Bang Theory,41,8
3532,Raj,14," Dude, everyone knows a time machine loses half its value the minute you drive it off the lot.",1,Big Bang Theory,94,18
3533,Sheldon,14," I'll go for two hundred, that time machine stays right where it is. ",1,Big Bang Theory,69,13
3534,Raj,14," Three hundred, and I'll throw in my original 1979 Mattel Millenium Falcon with real light speed sound effects. ",1,Big Bang Theory,112,18
3535,Leonard,14," No, no more toys or action figures or props or replicas or costumes or robots or Darth Vader voice changers, I'm getting rid of all of it. ",1,Big Bang Theory,140,27
3536,Howard,14," You can't do that, look what you've created here, it's like nerdvana. ",1,Big Bang Theory,71,12
3537,Raj,14," More importantly, you've a Darth Vader voice changer? ",1,Big Bang Theory,55,8
3538,Leonard,14, Not for long.,1,Big Bang Theory,14,3
3539,Raj,14," Oh, I call dibs on the Golden Age Flash.",1,Big Bang Theory,41,9
3540,Howard,14," Hang on, I need that to complete my Justice Society of America collection.",1,Big Bang Theory,75,13
3541,Raj,14," Too bad, I called dibs.",1,Big Bang Theory,24,5
3542,Howard,14, Well you can't just call dibs.,1,Big Bang Theory,31,6
3543,Raj,14," I can and I did, look up dibs on Wikipedia.",1,Big Bang Theory,44,10
3544,Sheldon,14, Dibs doesn't apply in a bidding war. ,1,Big Bang Theory,38,7
3545,Leonard,14," It's not a bidding war, I'm selling it all to Larry down at the comic book store. ",1,Big Bang Theory,83,17
3546,Raj,14, Why Larry? Did Larry call dibs? ,1,Big Bang Theory,33,6
3547,Howard,14, Will you forget dibs! ,1,Big Bang Theory,23,4
3548,Leonard,14, He offered me a fair price for the whole collection.,1,Big Bang Theory,53,10
3549,Sheldon,14," What's the number, I'll match it. ",1,Big Bang Theory,35,6
3550,Raj,14," I'll match it, plus a thousand rupees. ",1,Big Bang Theory,40,7
3551,Sheldon,14, What's the exchange rate.,1,Big Bang Theory,26,4
3552,Raj,14, None of your business. Take it or leave it.,1,Big Bang Theory,44,9
3553,Howard,14," Mom, my bar-mizvah bonds, how much do I got? Thanks. I can go twenty six hundred dollars and two trees in Israel. ",1,Big Bang Theory,115,22
3554,Leonard,14," Forget it guys, if I sell to one of you, the other two are going to be really mad at me.",1,Big Bang Theory,89,21
3555,Sheldon,14," Who cares, as long as you pick me. ",1,Big Bang Theory,36,8
3556,Raj,14," Okay, Leonard, put down the box, let's talk.",1,Big Bang Theory,45,8
3557,Leonard,14," Sorry Raj, my mind is made up.",1,Big Bang Theory,31,7
3558,Sheldon,14, No. I can't let you do this. ,1,Big Bang Theory,30,7
3559,Leonard,14," Sheldon, get out of my way.",1,Big Bang Theory,28,6
3560,Sheldon,14, None shall pass. ,1,Big Bang Theory,18,3
3561,Howard,14," Okay man, be cool, we're all friends here. ",1,Big Bang Theory,44,8
3562,Penny,14, What the hell's going on? ,1,Big Bang Theory,27,5
3563,Sheldon,14, You hypocrite!,1,Big Bang Theory,15,2
3564,Penny,14, What?,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
3565,Sheldon,14," Little Miss â€œgrown ups don't play with toysâ€ù. If I were to go into that apartment right now, would I find Beanie Babies? Are you not an accumulator of Care Bears and My Little Ponies? And who is that Japanese feline I see frolicking on your shorts? Hello,Hello Kitty! ",1,Big Bang Theory,273,49
3566,Penny,14," Okay, okay look, if this is about yesterday, Leonard, I am really sorry about what I said, I was just a bit upset.",1,Big Bang Theory,115,23
3567,Leonard,14," No, I needed to hear it.",1,Big Bang Theory,25,6
3568,Penny,14," No you didn't. Look, you are a great guy, and it is things you love that make you who you are. ",1,Big Bang Theory,96,21
3569,Howard,14, I guess that makes me large breasts. ,1,Big Bang Theory,38,7
3570,Leonard,14," Still, I think it's time for me to get rid of this stuff and you know move on with my life. ",1,Big Bang Theory,93,21
3571,Penny,14, Really?,1,Big Bang Theory,8,1
3572,Leonard,14, Yeah.,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
3573,Penny,14, Oh. Wow. Good for you. ,1,Big Bang Theory,24,5
3574,Leonard,14," Thanks. Hey, do you want to, I don't know, later",1,Big Bang Theory,49,10
3576,Penny,14, Hi Mike.,1,Big Bang Theory,9,2
3578,Penny,14," Yeah, I just have to change.",1,Big Bang Theory,29,6
3580,Penny,14," Oh, stop it! Bye guys. ",1,Big Bang Theory,24,5
3581,Leonard,14, My turn on the time machine. ,1,Big Bang Theory,30,6
3583,Sheldon,14," It worked. It really worked. They said I was mad, but it worked.  Oh no, not Morlocks! Not flesh-eating Morlocks! He-e-e-e-e-e-e-elp!  ",1,Big Bang Theory,136,21
3584,Leonard,14," Sheldon, are you okay? ",1,Big Bang Theory,24,4
3585,Sheldon,14, We have to get rid of the time machine. ,1,Big Bang Theory,41,9
3586,Leonard,14," It is a little big for the living room, isn't it?",1,Big Bang Theory,50,11
3587,Sheldon,14," Yeah, that's the problem, it's too big. ",1,Big Bang Theory,41,7
3588,Leonard,14," I'm glad you agree. I hired some guys to help us move it, come on in fellas. ",1,Big Bang Theory,78,17
3589,Sheldon,14," Oh no, Morlocks? Eat him, eat him. Aaaaargh.  Leonard!!!!!!!!",1,Big Bang Theory,62,9
3591,Leonard,15," On the other hand, some physicists are concerned that if the super collider actually works, it will create a black hole and swallow up the Earth ending life as we know it. ",1,Big Bang Theory,173,32
3592,Raj,15," Psh, what a bunch of crybabies. No guts, no glory man. ",1,Big Bang Theory,56,11
3593,Leonard,15," Hey, check it out, the school of pharmacology is looking for volunteers.",1,Big Bang Theory,73,12
3594,Raj,15," We are testing a new medication for social anxiety, panic attacks, agoraphobia and obsessive compulsive disorder. Why would they be looking for test subjects here? ",1,Big Bang Theory,165,25
3595,Leonard,15," I don't know, Raj. Maybe the comic book store doesn't have a bulletin board.  What's going on?",1,Big Bang Theory,95,17
3596,Howard,15, Shhh! Hot girl in Sheldon's office. ,1,Big Bang Theory,37,6
3597,Leonard,15, Sheldon's office? Is she lost? ,1,Big Bang Theory,32,5
3598,Howard,15, Don't think so. I followed her here from the parking lot. ,1,Big Bang Theory,59,11
3599,Leonard,15, Maybe she's his lawyer.,1,Big Bang Theory,24,4
3600,Howard,15, Well she's free to examine my briefs.,1,Big Bang Theory,38,7
3601,Leonard,15, Howard,1,Big Bang Theory,7,1
3602,Howard,15," I know, I'm disgusting, I should be punished. By her, oh look, I did it again. ",1,Big Bang Theory,80,16
3604,Sheldon,15, Thank you for coming by.  Hello.,1,Big Bang Theory,33,6
3605,Leonard,15," Oh, hey buddy. ",1,Big Bang Theory,16,3
3606,Sheldon,15, Buddy.,1,Big Bang Theory,7,1
3607,Howard,15," Sorry I'm late, I'm working on a project that may take me up on the next space shuttle.",1,Big Bang Theory,88,18
3608,Sheldon,15," How can you be late, I wasn't expecting you at all. ",1,Big Bang Theory,53,11
3609,Howard,15," Nobody ever expects me, sometimes you just look and BAM!  Howard Wolowitz. ",1,Big Bang Theory,76,12
3610,Leonard,15," Sheldon, are you going to introduce us? ",1,Big Bang Theory,41,7
3611,Sheldon,15," Oh, alright, this is Missy, Missy this is Leonard and Rajesh and you've already met Howard. ",1,Big Bang Theory,93,16
3613,Leonard,15," You too, swell, also.",1,Big Bang Theory,22,4
3614,Howard,15, Yeah. ,1,Big Bang Theory,7,1
3615,Leonard,15," So, how do you two know each other.",1,Big Bang Theory,36,8
3617,Leonard,15, Excuse me?,1,Big Bang Theory,11,2
3618,Sheldon,15," She's my twin sister, she thinks she's funny but frankly I've never been able to see it.",1,Big Bang Theory,89,17
3620,Sheldon,15, How exactly would one measure a sense of humour? A humourmometer? ,1,Big Bang Theory,67,11
3621,Howard,15," Well, I think you're delightfully droll. Or as the French say, Tres Drole. ",1,Big Bang Theory,76,13
3623,Sheldon,15, Rajesh. ,1,Big Bang Theory,9,1
3625,Leonard,15," So Missy, what brings you all the way from Texas? ",1,Big Bang Theory,51,10
3626,Howard,15," Was it perhaps destiny, I think it was destiny. ",1,Big Bang Theory,49,9
3628,Howard,15," Destiny, thy name is Anaheim. ",1,Big Bang Theory,31,5
3630,Sheldon,15," The papers could have been mailed, Mom just sent you here to spy on me, didn't she.",1,Big Bang Theory,84,17
3632,Sheldon,15," They call me a genius because I'm a genius. Tell Mom that I currently weigh 165 pounds, and that I'm having regular bowel movements. Enjoy the wedding, goodbye.",1,Big Bang Theory,161,28
3634,Leonard,15," If the wedding's not until tomorrow, why don't you stay with us tonight? ",1,Big Bang Theory,74,13
3636,Sheldon,15," They were not friends, they were imaginary colleagues. ",1,Big Bang Theory,56,8
3637,Leonard,15," Look, you're here, we have plenty of room.",1,Big Bang Theory,43,8
3638,Sheldon,15, No we don't.,1,Big Bang Theory,13,3
3639,Howard,15," Come on, Shelly, she's family.",1,Big Bang Theory,31,5
3640,Sheldon,15, So what? I don't issue invitations to your mother.,1,Big Bang Theory,51,9
3642,Sheldon,15, And don't ever call me Shelly.,1,Big Bang Theory,31,6
3643,Leonard,15, So it's settled. You'll stay with us.,1,Big Bang Theory,38,7
3644,Howard,15," I'll walk you to your car. You're in structure 3 level C, right? ",1,Big Bang Theory,66,13
3645,Sheldon,15, What just happened?,1,Big Bang Theory,20,3
3648,Leonard,15," Hee-hee, just classic. ",1,Big Bang Theory,24,3
3649,Sheldon,15, I needed a place to fire ceramic semi-conductor substrates for home-made integrated circuits. ,1,Big Bang Theory,95,13
3651,Sheldon,15, Made necessary by her insistence on going into my room.,1,Big Bang Theory,56,10
3653,Howard,15," Ha-ha, not your eyebrows? ",1,Big Bang Theory,27,4
3655,Sheldon,15, Is that what that was? I just assumed that the second grade curriculum had rendered you quizzical. ,1,Big Bang Theory,100,17
3656,Penny,15," Hey, Leonard, you left your underwear in the dryer downstairs. ",1,Big Bang Theory,64,10
3657,Leonard,15, Those are not mine.,1,Big Bang Theory,20,4
3658,Penny,15," Really, they have your little name label in them. ",1,Big Bang Theory,51,9
3659,Leonard,15," Yeah, no, I do, I use those uh just to polish up my spear-fishing equipment. I spear fish. When I'm not crossbow hunting, I spear fish. Uh, Penny, this is Sheldon's twin sister, Missy. Missy, this is our neighbour Penny.",1,Big Bang Theory,221,40
3661,Penny,15," Wow, you don't look that much alike.",1,Big Bang Theory,37,7
3662,Howard,15, Can I get a hallelujah. ,1,Big Bang Theory,25,5
3663,Sheldon,15," Fraternal twins come from two separate eggs, they are no more alike than any other siblings.",1,Big Bang Theory,93,16
3664,Howard,15, Hallelujah. ,1,Big Bang Theory,13,1
3665,Raj,15," Hey, guess what. I've been accepted as a test subject for a new miracle drug to overcome pathological shyness. ",1,Big Bang Theory,112,19
3666,Penny,15," Hey, good for you, Raj.",1,Big Bang Theory,24,5
3667,Raj,15," Yes, I'm very hopeful. Hello Missy.  They mentioned there may be side effects. ",1,Big Bang Theory,80,13
3669,Raj,15," So, Missy. Have you ever met a man from the exotic subcontinent of India? ",1,Big Bang Theory,75,14
3671,Raj,15," Ah yes, Dr Patel, good man.",1,Big Bang Theory,28,6
3672,Howard,15," Do you like motorcycles, â€˜cos I ride a hog. ",1,Big Bang Theory,47,9
3673,Raj,15, A hog? You have a two cylinder scooter with a basket on the front. ,1,Big Bang Theory,68,14
3674,Howard,15, You still have to wear a helmet. ,1,Big Bang Theory,34,7
3675,Raj,15, Have you ever heard of the Kama Sutra? ,1,Big Bang Theory,40,8
3677,Raj,15," The Indian sex book. In other words if you wonder wonder who wrote the book of love, it was us.",1,Big Bang Theory,96,20
3678,Penny,15," Hey, Sheldon's sister's pretty cute, I w.",1,Big Bang Theory,42,7
3679,Leonard,15, I wasn't staring! ,1,Big Bang Theory,19,3
3680,Penny,15," I didn't say you were, I just said she was cute. ",1,Big Bang Theory,50,11
3681,Leonard,15," Oh. Huh, um, maybe, if you like women who are tall and perfect. ",1,Big Bang Theory,65,13
3682,Penny,15," Sheldon, why are you ignoring your sister?",1,Big Bang Theory,43,7
3683,Sheldon,15, I'm not ignoring my sister. I'm ignoring all of you. ,1,Big Bang Theory,54,10
3684,Leonard,15, I brought snacks.,1,Big Bang Theory,18,3
3686,Leonard,15," Onion dip, it's onion dip. ",1,Big Bang Theory,28,5
3688,Leonard,15, We don't entertain much. ,1,Big Bang Theory,26,4
3689,Raj,15," Missy, do you enjoy pajamas?",1,Big Bang Theory,29,5
3691,Raj,15, We Indians invented them. You're welcome.,1,Big Bang Theory,42,6
3692,Howard,15," Yeah, well my people invented circumcision. You're welcome!",1,Big Bang Theory,60,8
3693,Penny,15," Missy, I'm going to go get my nails done. Do you want to come?",1,Big Bang Theory,63,14
3695,Penny,15, You're welcome. ,1,Big Bang Theory,17,2
3697,Howard,15, Bye Missy.,1,Big Bang Theory,11,2
3698,Leonard,15," Bye Missy, see you.",1,Big Bang Theory,20,4
3699,Penny,15, Goodbye Leonard! ,1,Big Bang Theory,18,2
3700,Leonard,15," Uh, yeah, no, uh, bye Penny.",1,Big Bang Theory,29,6
3701,Howard,15," Okay, you two have to back off.",1,Big Bang Theory,32,7
3702,Raj,15," Why should I back off, you back off dude.",1,Big Bang Theory,42,9
3703,Leonard,15," Excuse me, this is my apartment and she's my roommate's sister.",1,Big Bang Theory,64,11
3704,Howard,15," So what, you've already got Penny. ",1,Big Bang Theory,36,6
3705,Leonard,15, How do I have Penny? In what universe do I have Penny?,1,Big Bang Theory,55,12
3706,Howard,15, So I can have Penny?,1,Big Bang Theory,21,5
3707,Leonard,15," Hell, no! ",1,Big Bang Theory,11,2
3708,Sheldon,15," Excuse me, can I interject something. I'm ordering pizza online, is everyone okay with pepperoni? ",1,Big Bang Theory,99,15
3709,Leonard,15," Sheldon, can I talk to you in private?",1,Big Bang Theory,39,8
3710,Sheldon,15," I guess. Don't worry, I was going to order you cheeseless.",1,Big Bang Theory,59,11
3711,Leonard,15, Thank you. ,1,Big Bang Theory,12,2
3712,Sheldon,15, That's okay. Lactose intolerance is nothing to be embarrassed about. ,1,Big Bang Theory,70,10
3713,Howard,15," I'm a fancy Indian man, we invented pajamas! ",1,Big Bang Theory,46,8
3714,Raj,15," Hey, look at me, I don't have a foreskin. ",1,Big Bang Theory,43,9
3716,Leonard,15," Sheldon, are you aware that your sister is an incredibly attractive woman?",1,Big Bang Theory,75,12
3717,Sheldon,15," Hmmm? She certainly has the symmetry and low body fat that western culture deems desirable. It's noteworth that at other points in history, heavier women were the standard for beauty because their girth suggested affluence. ",1,Big Bang Theory,225,35
3718,Leonard,15," That's fascinating, but I",1,Big Bang Theory,26,4
3719,Sheldon,15," I didn't say it was fascinating, I said it was noteworthy.",1,Big Bang Theory,59,11
3720,Leonard,15," Alright, noted. But my point is that Koothrappali and Wolowitz they're hitting on your sister. ",1,Big Bang Theory,96,15
3721,Sheldon,15," Oh. Okay. You know, I don't want to criticise your rhetorical style but, we'd be a lot further along in this conversation if you'd begun with that thought. ",1,Big Bang Theory,157,28
3722,Leonard,15," That's great, but I.",1,Big Bang Theory,21,4
3723,Sheldon,15, What I'm saying is that we took quite an unnecessary detour from what I now understand to be your thesis.,1,Big Bang Theory,106,20
3724,Leonard,15, Whatever. You have to do something about it.,1,Big Bang Theory,45,8
3725,Sheldon,15, Why?,1,Big Bang Theory,5,1
3726,Leonard,15, Because she's your sister. ,1,Big Bang Theory,28,4
3727,Sheldon,15," I don't understand. Yes, we shared a uterus for nine months, but since then we've pretty much gone our own separate ways. ",1,Big Bang Theory,123,22
3728,Leonard,15," Okay, uh. oh, consider this. With your father gone, it is your responsibility to make sure that Missy chooses a suitable mate. ",1,Big Bang Theory,128,22
3729,Sheldon,15, I hadn't considered that. We do share DNA.,1,Big Bang Theory,43,8
3730,Leonard,15, Uh-huh. ,1,Big Bang Theory,9,1
3731,Sheldon,15," So there is the possibility, however remote, that resting in her loins is the potential for another individual as remarkable as myself. ",1,Big Bang Theory,137,22
3732,Leonard,15," Exactly. And, you owe it to yourself and to posterity to protect the genetic integrity of your sister's future offspring. ",1,Big Bang Theory,123,20
3733,Sheldon,15," You're right. If someone wants to get at Missy's fallopian tubes, they'll have to go through me. ",1,Big Bang Theory,98,17
3735,Raj,15," I am Shiva the destroyer, I will have the woman! ",1,Big Bang Theory,50,10
3736,Howard,15," I'm warning you, I was judo champion at math camp. ",1,Big Bang Theory,52,10
3737,Sheldon,15," Alright, that's enough juvenile squabbling, stop it, stop it I say. I'm going to settle this right now. Neither of you are good enough for my sister. ",1,Big Bang Theory,151,27
3738,Howard,15, Who are you to decide that?,1,Big Bang Theory,28,6
3739,Leonard,15," He's the man of his family, you have to respect his wishes.",1,Big Bang Theory,60,12
3740,Sheldon,15," You're out too, by the way.",1,Big Bang Theory,28,6
3741,Leonard,15, Say what?,1,Big Bang Theory,10,2
3742,Sheldon,15," It's nothing personal, I'd just prefer if my future niece or nephew didn't become flatulent every time they eat an Eskimo pie. ",1,Big Bang Theory,128,22
3743,Howard,15, What are you so happy about?,1,Big Bang Theory,29,6
3744,Raj,15," I'm not happy, it's the medication, I can't stop smiling. ",1,Big Bang Theory,59,10
3745,Sheldon,15," Now that Leonard's made me aware of how high the genetic stakes are, we have to face the fact that none of you are suitable mates for my sister. ",1,Big Bang Theory,146,29
3746,Howard,15, Wait a minute. Leonard made you aware of that? ,1,Big Bang Theory,48,9
3747,Leonard,15," We all make mistakes, let's move on. ",1,Big Bang Theory,38,7
3748,Raj,15," Excuse me, but I think you're missing a big opportunity here. ",1,Big Bang Theory,63,11
3749,Sheldon,15, How so?,1,Big Bang Theory,8,2
3750,Raj,15, Everybody knows genetic diversity produces the strongest offspring. Why not put a little mocha in the family latte. ,1,Big Bang Theory,117,18
3751,Sheldon,15," In principle you have a point, but as a practical matter, need I remind you that it takes experimental pharmaceuticals to simply enable you to speak to the opposite sex.",1,Big Bang Theory,170,30
3752,Raj,15, I think you're focussing entirely too much on the drugs. ,1,Big Bang Theory,58,10
3753,Howard,15," Is it â€˜cause I'm Jewish, â€˜cause I'd kill my Rabbi with a porkchop to be with your sister.",1,Big Bang Theory,94,18
3754,Sheldon,15," This has nothing to do with religion. This has to do with the fact that you're a tiny, tiny man who still lives with his mother. ",1,Big Bang Theory,130,26
3755,Leonard,15," Sheldon, you are really being unreasonable. ",1,Big Bang Theory,45,6
3756,Sheldon,15, Am I? Here. Eat this cheese without farting and you can sleep with my sister. ,1,Big Bang Theory,79,15
3758,Sheldon,15, Oops. ,1,Big Bang Theory,7,1
3760,Sheldon,15, Why does everyone suddenly want to talk to me alone? Usually nobody wants to be alone with me. ,1,Big Bang Theory,96,18
3761,Leonard,15," We all make mistakes, let's move on.",1,Big Bang Theory,37,7
3764,Sheldon,15," Truthfully, I've never given it any thought, but it has been pointed out to me that you carry DNA of great potential.",1,Big Bang Theory,118,22
3766,Sheldon,15," Let me explain. You see, I'm a superior genetic mutation, an improvement on the existing mediocre stock. ",1,Big Bang Theory,106,17
3768,Sheldon,15," That would be you. But residing within you is the potential for another me. Perhaps even taller, smarter and less prone to freckling, a Sheldon 2.0 if you will. ",1,Big Bang Theory,162,29
3770,Sheldon,15," Exactly. Now, I am not saying that I should be the sole decider of who you mate with. If you're not attracted to the suitor then the likelihood of conception would be reduced.",1,Big Bang Theory,176,33
3772,Sheldon,15, Not at all. Frequent coitus dramatically increases the odds of fertiliziation. ,1,Big Bang Theory,80,11
3774,Sheldon,15," I always thought I was more like a cuckoo bird. You know, a superior creature whose egg is placed in the nest of ordinary birds. Of course the newly hatched cuckoo eats all the food, leaving the ordinary siblings to starve to death. Luckily for you, that's where the metaphor ended. ",1,Big Bang Theory,284,51
3776,Sheldon,15, I have an alternate proposal. ,1,Big Bang Theory,31,5
3778,Sheldon,15," You donate eggs. We will place them in cryogenic storage. I will find an appropriate sperm donor for your eggs, have them fertilized and implanted in you, that way everybody wins. ",1,Big Bang Theory,181,31
3780,Sheldon,15, Correction. Missy can date whoever she wants. ,1,Big Bang Theory,47,7
3782,Howard,15," Look, we have to settle this.",1,Big Bang Theory,30,6
3783,Leonard,15, I agree. Sheldon's sister is hiding at Penny's because we've all been hitting on her at the same time. ,1,Big Bang Theory,104,19
3784,Raj,15," She's not hiding. She needed privacy to call her grandmother who's apparently very sick. Oh, and then I believe she has to wash her hair. ",1,Big Bang Theory,139,25
3785,Howard,15," Oh, you poor, deluded bastard. ",1,Big Bang Theory,32,5
3786,Raj,15, Don't start with me dude.,1,Big Bang Theory,26,5
3787,Howard,15, You want to go again? Let's go. ,1,Big Bang Theory,33,7
3788,Leonard,15, Sit down.,1,Big Bang Theory,10,2
3789,Howard,15, Okay. ,1,Big Bang Theory,7,1
3790,Leonard,15," If we're going to fight over Missy, let's do it the right way. The honourable way.",1,Big Bang Theory,83,16
3791,Leonard,15, And he's down!,1,Big Bang Theory,15,3
3792,Howard,15," Come on, come on, get up. ",1,Big Bang Theory,27,6
3793,Leonard,15," Stay down, bitch. Yeah, ha ha, natural selection at work.",1,Big Bang Theory,58,10
3794,Sheldon,15, I weep for humanity. ,1,Big Bang Theory,22,4
3795,Leonard,15, Excuse me while I go tell Missy the good news. ,1,Big Bang Theory,48,10
3796,Penny,15," Ah, hey Leonard.",1,Big Bang Theory,17,3
3797,Leonard,15," Hi Penny, how's it going. Listen, that guy Mike that you were dating, is that still going on?",1,Big Bang Theory,94,18
3798,Penny,15," Uh, pretty much, why?",1,Big Bang Theory,22,4
3799,Leonard,15," Nothing, just catching up. By the way, may I speak to Missy please? ",1,Big Bang Theory,69,13
3800,Penny,15, Of course.,1,Big Bang Theory,11,2
3802,Leonard,15," Well, since you're leaving tomorrow I was wondering if you'd like to go out to dinner with me?",1,Big Bang Theory,95,18
3804,Leonard,15," Oh. You have other plans, or?",1,Big Bang Theory,30,6
3806,Leonard,15, Oh. Alright uh enjoy the rest of your evening.,1,Big Bang Theory,47,9
3808,Leonard,15," Um, here's something we didn't anticipate. ",1,Big Bang Theory,44,6
3809,Penny,15," What do you want, Howard?",1,Big Bang Theory,26,5
3810,Howard,15," I'm fine, thanks for asking. I've come to call on Missy. ",1,Big Bang Theory,58,11
3811,Penny,15, Missy?,1,Big Bang Theory,7,1
3813,Howard,15, The amazing Howard. Do you like magic?,1,Big Bang Theory,39,7
3815,Howard,15," Then you are in for a treat. Behold, an ordinary cane.  Da-dah! ",1,Big Bang Theory,65,12
3817,Howard,15, Okay. ,1,Big Bang Theory,7,1
3818,Penny,15, Missy?,1,Big Bang Theory,7,1
3819,Raj,15, Thank you. I apprec.  apprec. appreeee. oh-oh.,1,Big Bang Theory,47,7
3820,Penny,15," Oh, honey, is your medication wearing off? ",1,Big Bang Theory,44,7
3825,Sheldon,15," Well, she might be interested to know that I have refocused my research from bosonic string theory to heteronic string theory. ",1,Big Bang Theory,128,21
3827,Sheldon,15," Okay, well, it was pleasant seeing you, other than that business with my testicles. ",1,Big Bang Theory,85,14
3829,Sheldon,15, Really?,1,Big Bang Theory,8,1
3831,Sheldon,15, You tell people I'm a rocket scientist?,1,Big Bang Theory,40,7
3833,Sheldon,15, I'm a theoretical physicist.,1,Big Bang Theory,29,4
3835,Sheldon,15, What's the difference?,1,Big Bang Theory,23,3
3837,Sheldon,15," My God! Why don't you just tell them I'm a toll taker at the Golden Gate Bridge? Rocket scientist, how humiliating. ",1,Big Bang Theory,117,21
3839,Penny,16," Hey, guys, guys, some of the other waitresses wanted me to ask you something.",1,Big Bang Theory,78,14
3840,Leonard,16," Oh, it's called trestling.",1,Big Bang Theory,27,4
3841,Howard,16, It combines the physical strength of arm wrestling with the mental agility of tetris into the ultimate sport. ,1,Big Bang Theory,111,18
3842,Penny,16," Yeah, that's terrific, but what they wanted me to ask you was to cut it the hell out.  Right come on guys, come on.  Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you",1,Big Bang Theory,162,32
3843,Sheldon,16," We might as well stop, it's a stalemate. You're beating me in tetris, but you've got the upper body strength of a Keebler Elf.",1,Big Bang Theory,127,24
3844,Raj,16," Keebler Elf? I've got your Keebler Elf right here.  Okay, it's a stalemate. ",1,Big Bang Theory,77,13
3845,Penny,16," So Leonard, will we be seeing you on Saturday for your free birthday cheesecake?",1,Big Bang Theory,81,14
3846,Sheldon,16," He can't eat cheesecake, he's lactose intolerant. ",1,Big Bang Theory,51,7
3847,Penny,16," Okay, he can have carrot cake.",1,Big Bang Theory,31,6
3848,Sheldon,16, What about the cream cheese frosting.,1,Big Bang Theory,38,6
3849,Penny,16, he can scrape it off. ,1,Big Bang Theory,23,5
3850,Leonard,16," Forget about the cake, how did you know that my birthday is Saturday? ",1,Big Bang Theory,71,13
3851,Penny,16," I did your horoscope, remember, I was going to do everybody's until Sheldon went on one of his typical psychotic rants.",1,Big Bang Theory,120,21
3852,Sheldon,16," For the record, that psychotic rant was a concise summation of the research of Bertram Forer, who in 1948 proved conclusively through meticulously designed experiments, that astrology is nothing but pseudo scientific hokum. ",1,Big Bang Theory,225,33
3853,Penny,16," Blah blah blah, a typical Taurus. So, seriously, are we going to see you Saturday?",1,Big Bang Theory,83,15
3854,Leonard,16," Oh, I don't think so.",1,Big Bang Theory,22,5
3855,Penny,16, Why not?,1,Big Bang Theory,9,2
3856,Leonard,16, I don't celebrate my birthday.,1,Big Bang Theory,31,5
3857,Penny,16," Shuddup, yeah you do. ",1,Big Bang Theory,23,4
3858,Leonard,16," No, it's no big deal, it's just the way I was raised. My parents focussed on celebrating achievements, and being expelled from a birth canal was not considered one of them.",1,Big Bang Theory,173,31
3859,Penny,16," Uh, that's so silly.",1,Big Bang Theory,21,4
3860,Sheldon,16," It's actually based on very sound theories, his mother published a paper on it. ",1,Big Bang Theory,81,14
3861,Penny,16," What was it called, â€œI hate my son and that's why he can't have cake?â€ù ",1,Big Bang Theory,76,15
3862,Sheldon,16," It was obviously effective, Leonard grew up to be an experimental physicist. Perhaps if she'd also denied him Christmas he'd be a little better at it. ",1,Big Bang Theory,152,26
3863,Leonard,16, Thank you.,1,Big Bang Theory,11,2
3864,Howard,16," Well I love birthdays, waking up to Mom's special French Toast breakfast, wearing the birthday king crown, playing laser tag with all my friends.",1,Big Bang Theory,146,24
3865,Penny,16," Yeah, see, that's what kids should have. ",1,Big Bang Theory,42,7
3866,Howard,16, Actually that was last year. ,1,Big Bang Theory,30,5
3867,Penny,16, So you've really never had a birthday party? ,1,Big Bang Theory,46,8
3868,Leonard,16," No. But it was okay. I mean, when I was little I'd think maybe my parents would change their mind, and surprise me with a party, like this one birthday I came home from my Cello lesson, and I saw a lot of strange cars parked out front, and when I got to the door I could hear people whispering, and I could smell German chocolate cake, which is my favourite.",1,Big Bang Theory,359,71
3869,Penny,16, And?,1,Big Bang Theory,5,1
3870,Leonard,16," Uh, it turns out my grandfather had died. ",1,Big Bang Theory,43,8
3871,Penny,16," Oh my God, that's terrible. ",1,Big Bang Theory,29,5
3872,Leonard,16," Oh, it was kind of like a birthday party. I got to see all my cousins and there was cake, so7",1,Big Bang Theory,94,21
3873,Penny,16, That's the saddest thing I've ever heard. ,1,Big Bang Theory,43,7
3874,Howard,16," You think? Go ahead, tell her about your senior prom. ",1,Big Bang Theory,55,10
3876,Howard,16, Make sure they remember no peanuts.,1,Big Bang Theory,36,6
3877,Leonard,16," Howard, every Thai restaurant in town knows you can't eat peanuts. They see me coming they go â€œah, no peanut boy!â€ù",1,Big Bang Theory,119,21
3878,Sheldon,16, Hello Penny. Leonard just left.,1,Big Bang Theory,32,5
3879,Penny,16, I know. I want to talk to you. ,1,Big Bang Theory,32,8
3880,Sheldon,16," What would we talk about? We've no overlapping areas of interest I'm aware of, and you know I don't care for chit-chat. ",1,Big Bang Theory,121,22
3881,Penny,16," Okay, can you just let me in.",1,Big Bang Theory,30,7
3882,Sheldon,16," Well alright, but I don't see this as a promising endeavour.",1,Big Bang Theory,61,11
3883,Penny,16," Okay, here's the deal, we are going to throw Leonard a kick-ass surprise party for his birthday on Saturday.",1,Big Bang Theory,109,19
3884,Sheldon,16," I hardly think so, Leonard made it very clear he doesn't want a party.",1,Big Bang Theory,71,14
3885,Howard,16, Did someone say party? ,1,Big Bang Theory,24,4
3886,Penny,16, He just doesn't know he wants one because he's never had one. ,1,Big Bang Theory,63,12
3887,Howard,16," I suppose that's possible, but for the record, I've never had a threesome and yet I still know I want one.",1,Big Bang Theory,107,21
3888,Penny,16," Howard, here's the difference. The possibility exists that Leonard could have a birthday party before hell freezes over. ",1,Big Bang Theory,122,18
3889,Howard,16," Fine. If I do have a threesome, you can't be part of it. I'm just kidding, yes you can. Can you bring a friend? ",1,Big Bang Theory,113,24
3890,Sheldon,16, I think a birthday party is a terrible idea. I envy Leonard for growing up without that anguish. ,1,Big Bang Theory,98,18
3891,Penny,16, Anguish?,1,Big Bang Theory,9,1
3892,Sheldon,16," Year after year, I had to endure wearing conical hats while being forced into the crowded sweaty hell of bouncy castles, not to mention being blindfolded and spun towards a grotesque tailless donkey as the other children mocked my disorientation. ",1,Big Bang Theory,248,40
3893,Penny,16," Okay, sweetie, I understand you have scars that no non-professional can heal, but nevertheless we are going to throw Leonard a birthday party. ",1,Big Bang Theory,144,23
3894,Sheldon,16," Have I pointed out that I am extremely uncomfortable with dancing, loud music and most other forms of alcohol induced frivolity. ",1,Big Bang Theory,130,21
3895,Penny,16, Nevertheless we are.,1,Big Bang Theory,21,3
3896,Sheldon,16, In addition I really don't think that Leonard wants a,1,Big Bang Theory,54,10
3897,Penny,16," Okay, here's the deal, you either help me throw Leonard a birthday party or, so help me God, I will go into your bedroom and I will unbag all of your most valuable mint condition comic books. And on one of them, you won't know which, I'll draw a tiny happy face in ink. ",1,Big Bang Theory,271,54
3898,Sheldon,16," You can't do that, if you make a mark on a mint comic book it's no longer mint.",1,Big Bang Theory,80,18
3899,Penny,16," Sheldon, do you understand the concept of blackmail?",1,Big Bang Theory,53,8
3900,Sheldon,16," Well of course I oh! Yeah, I have an idea, let's throw Leonard a kick ass birthday party.",1,Big Bang Theory,90,18
3902,Sheldon,16, That's not the secret knock. This is the secret knock. ,1,Big Bang Theory,56,10
3903,Howard,16, What difference does it make?,1,Big Bang Theory,30,5
3904,Sheldon,16, The whole point of a secret knock is to establish a non-verbal signal to verify the identity of one's co-conspirators. ,1,Big Bang Theory,120,20
3905,Penny,16, Is that Raj and Howard?,1,Big Bang Theory,24,5
3906,Howard,16, Can you just let us in.,1,Big Bang Theory,24,6
3907,Sheldon,16, Luckily for you this is not a nuclear reactor. ,1,Big Bang Theory,48,9
3908,Penny,16," So, what did you get the birthday boy?",1,Big Bang Theory,39,8
3909,Howard,16," Well, Raj got him an awesome limited edition Dark Knight sculpture based on Alex Ross's definitive Batman, and I got him this amazing autographed copy of the Feynman lectures on physics.",1,Big Bang Theory,187,31
3910,Penny,16, Nice. I got him a sweater. ,1,Big Bang Theory,28,6
3911,Howard,16," Okay, well, he might like that, I've seen him chilly. ",1,Big Bang Theory,55,10
3912,Penny,16," Uh, Sheldon, I didn't see your present.",1,Big Bang Theory,40,7
3913,Sheldon,16, That's because I didn't bring one.,1,Big Bang Theory,35,6
3914,Penny,16, Well why not? ,1,Big Bang Theory,15,3
3915,Howard,16, Don't ask.,1,Big Bang Theory,11,2
3916,Sheldon,16, The entire institution of gift giving makes no sense.,1,Big Bang Theory,54,9
3917,Howard,16, Too late.,1,Big Bang Theory,10,2
3918,Sheldon,16," Let's say that I go out and I spend fifty dollars on you, it's a laborious activity, because I have to imagine what you need, whereas you know what you need. Now I can simplify things, just give you the fifty dollars directly and, you could give me fifty dollars on my birthday, and so on until one of us dies leaving the other one old and fifty dollars richer. And I ask you, is it worth it? ",1,Big Bang Theory,394,78
3919,Howard,16, Told you not to ask. ,1,Big Bang Theory,22,5
3920,Penny,16," Well, Sheldon, you're his friend. Friends give each other presents.",1,Big Bang Theory,68,10
3921,Sheldon,16," I accept your premise, I reject your conclusion.",1,Big Bang Theory,49,8
3922,Howard,16, Try telling him it's a non-optional social convention. ,1,Big Bang Theory,56,8
3923,Penny,16, What?,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
3924,Howard,16, Just do it. ,1,Big Bang Theory,13,3
3925,Penny,16, It's a non-optional social convention.,1,Big Bang Theory,39,5
3926,Sheldon,16, Oh. Fair enough. ,1,Big Bang Theory,18,3
3927,Howard,16, He came with a manual. ,1,Big Bang Theory,24,5
3928,Sheldon,16," Question, how am I going to get Leonard a present before the party? I don't drive, and the only things available within walking distance are a Thai restaurant and a gas station. I suppose I could wrap up an order of mee krob and a couple of lottery scratchers. ",1,Big Bang Theory,262,49
3929,Penny,16," Okay, let's do this, um, I will drive Sheldon to get a present, and Howard, you need to get rid of Leonard for about two hours. ",1,Big Bang Theory,129,26
3930,Howard,16, No problem.,1,Big Bang Theory,12,2
3931,Penny,16," And then Raj, you bring the stuff across the hall and start setting up.",1,Big Bang Theory,72,14
3932,Howard,16, What if guests show up?,1,Big Bang Theory,24,5
3933,Penny,16, Entertain them.,1,Big Bang Theory,16,2
3934,Howard,16, What if they're women?,1,Big Bang Theory,23,4
3935,Penny,16, Stare at them and make them feel uncomfortable. ,1,Big Bang Theory,49,8
3937,Howard,16, Hey!,1,Big Bang Theory,5,1
3938,Leonard,16, Hey. ,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
3939,Howard,16, How's it going?,1,Big Bang Theory,16,3
3940,Leonard,16, Fine. ,1,Big Bang Theory,7,1
3941,Howard,16," So, listen, the New Art is showing the revised definitive cut of Blade Runner.",1,Big Bang Theory,79,14
3942,Leonard,16, Seen it.,1,Big Bang Theory,9,2
3943,Howard,16," No, you've seen the 25th anniversary final cut. This one has eight seconds of previously unseen footage. They say it completely changes the tone of the film. ",1,Big Bang Theory,159,27
3944,Leonard,16, Oh. Pass. ,1,Big Bang Theory,11,2
3945,Howard,16," Come on, afterwards there's a Q & A with Harrison Ford's body double. ",1,Big Bang Theory,71,13
3946,Leonard,16," Look, I am in the Halo battle of my life here, there's this kid in Copenhagen, he has no immune system so all he does is sit in his bubble and play Halo 24/7.",1,Big Bang Theory,159,34
3947,Howard,16, Can't you play him some other time?,1,Big Bang Theory,36,7
3948,Leonard,16, Not if you believe his doctors. ,1,Big Bang Theory,33,6
3949,Howard,16," Oh my God, do you smell gas.",1,Big Bang Theory,29,7
3950,Leonard,16, No.,1,Big Bang Theory,4,1
3951,Howard,16," Yeah, no. ",1,Big Bang Theory,11,2
3953,Penny,16," Alright, you know they have DVDs over there.",1,Big Bang Theory,45,8
3954,Sheldon,16," Yes, but they have DVD burners over here. Leonard needs a DVD burner. ",1,Big Bang Theory,71,13
3955,Penny,16," Sheldon, a gift shouldn't be something someone needs, it should be something fun, you know, something they wouldn't buy for themselves.",1,Big Bang Theory,136,21
3956,Sheldon,16," You mean, like a sweater? ",1,Big Bang Theory,27,5
3957,Penny,16," Well, it's a fun sweater, it's got a bold geometric print. ",1,Big Bang Theory,60,11
3958,Sheldon,16, Is it the geometry that makes it fun.,1,Big Bang Theory,38,8
3959,Penny,16," Okay, the point is, one of the ways we show we care about people is by putting thought and imagination into the gifts we give them. ",1,Big Bang Theory,133,26
3960,Sheldon,16," Okay, I see, so not a DVD burner.",1,Big Bang Theory,34,8
3961,Penny,16, Exactly.,1,Big Bang Theory,9,1
3962,Sheldon,16," Something he wouldn't buy for himself. Something fun. Something like oh, an 802.11n wireless router. ",1,Big Bang Theory,102,15
3964,Leonard,16," Here you go, Copenhagen boy, how about a taste of Hans Christian Hand Grenade.  Come on, come on, oh you clever little. Come on, come on, take that! ",1,Big Bang Theory,150,28
3965,Howard,16, Oh-oh.  Oh-oh! ,1,Big Bang Theory,16,2
3966,Leonard,16, What's the matter?,1,Big Bang Theory,19,3
3967,Howard,16," This granola bar, there's peanuts in it.",1,Big Bang Theory,41,7
3968,Leonard,16," Oh my God, why did you eat it?",1,Big Bang Theory,31,8
3969,Howard,16," I don't know, it was just there.",1,Big Bang Theory,33,7
3970,Leonard,16," Well if I had a gun there, would you have shot yourself? ",1,Big Bang Theory,58,12
3971,Howard,16," Don't yell at me, I've got to go to the emergency room. ",1,Big Bang Theory,57,12
3972,Leonard,16, Now?,1,Big Bang Theory,5,1
3973,Howard,16," No, after my tongue has swollen to the size of a brisket. ",1,Big Bang Theory,59,12
3974,Leonard,16," Alright, um, just, uh, let me get my keys.",1,Big Bang Theory,43,9
3975,Howard,16," Oh God, oh God, oh God, oh.  The laundry is out of the hamper.  Okay Sheldon, what was it supposed to be? Fine, it's out of the washer. I'll call you when it's in the dryer. ",1,Big Bang Theory,175,36
3976,Leonard,16," Alright, let's go.  ",1,Big Bang Theory,21,3
3978,Sheldon,16, What do you think.,1,Big Bang Theory,19,4
3979,Penny,16," Um, that one. ",1,Big Bang Theory,15,3
3980,Sheldon,16, Because of the two additional Ethernet ports.,1,Big Bang Theory,46,7
3981,Penny,16, Sure.,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
3982,Sheldon,16," He doesn't need them, he's already got a 640 connect switch ",1,Big Bang Theory,61,11
3983,Penny,16," Oh, okay then this one. ",1,Big Bang Theory,25,5
3984,Sheldon,16, Why? ,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
3985,Penny,16," I don't know, the man on the box looks so happy. ",1,Big Bang Theory,50,11
3986,Sheldon,16," Penny! If I'm going to buy Leonard a gift, I'm going to do it right. I refuse to let him experience the same childhood trauma I did. ",1,Big Bang Theory,134,27
3987,Penny,16," Oh, I know I'm going to regret this but, what trauma? ",1,Big Bang Theory,55,11
3988,Sheldon,16," On my twelfth birthday I really wanted a titanium centrifuge, so, you know, I could separate radioactive isotopes. ",1,Big Bang Theory,116,18
3989,Penny,16, Of course.,1,Big Bang Theory,11,2
3990,Sheldon,16," Instead of a titanium centrifuge, my parents bought me wow, this is hard. They got me a motorised dirt bike. ",1,Big Bang Theory,110,20
3991,Penny,16, No? ,1,Big Bang Theory,5,1
3992,Sheldon,16, What twelve year old boy wants a motorised dirt bike? ,1,Big Bang Theory,55,10
3993,Penny,16, All of them.,1,Big Bang Theory,13,3
3994,Sheldon,16, Really?,1,Big Bang Theory,8,1
3995,Penny,16, Yeah.,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
3996,Sheldon,16, Huh? ,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
3997,Penny,16," Okay, so we're getting this one?",1,Big Bang Theory,33,6
3998,Sheldon,16," Yeah, I suppose. ",1,Big Bang Theory,18,3
3999,Penny,16," Okay, let's go.",1,Big Bang Theory,16,3
4001,Sheldon,16, I know everything about this stuff.,1,Big Bang Theory,36,6
4003,Penny,16," Here, buy this one. Look, it's the one we're getting, see, happy guy available. ",1,Big Bang Theory,81,14
4004,Sheldon,16," No, no, no, no, she doesn't want that, she needs a point to point peer network with a range extender.",1,Big Bang Theory,102,20
4007,Sheldon,16, It depends on what Bus you have.,1,Big Bang Theory,33,7
4009,Sheldon,16," Oh, dear lord.",1,Big Bang Theory,15,3
4010,Penny,16," Sheldon, we have to go.",1,Big Bang Theory,24,5
4011,Sheldon,16," Not now, Penny, this poor man needs me.  You hold on, I'll be right with you. What computer do you have, and please don't say a white one?",1,Big Bang Theory,139,28
4013,Howard,16, Excuse me.,1,Big Bang Theory,11,2
4015,Howard,16," No, listen, see we're throwing my friend a surprise party and I'm supposed to keep him out of his apartment for two hours.",1,Big Bang Theory,123,23
4017,Howard,16," No, see, the only way I could get him to leave is to tell him I ate a peanut. Because I'm allergic to peanuts. ",1,Big Bang Theory,112,24
4019,Howard,16," Look, all I need from you is to take me in the back and give me a band-aid so I can pretend I had a shot of epinephrine and they you tell my friend you need to keep me under observation for about an hour, hour and a half. ",1,Big Bang Theory,223,49
4021,Howard,16, Yes.,1,Big Bang Theory,5,1
4023,Howard,16," No, you don't understand.",1,Big Bang Theory,26,4
4025,Howard,16," Okay, I get it, I know how the world works, how about if I were to introduce you  to the man who freed your people. ",1,Big Bang Theory,117,25
4026,Leonard,16," Hey, sorry I couldn't find a parking spot, how are you doing.",1,Big Bang Theory,62,12
4027,Howard,16," Bad, very bad. ",1,Big Bang Theory,16,3
4028,Leonard,16," Really, â€˜cos you don't look like you're swelling up at all, maybe we should just pick up some benedryl at the drug store and go home. ",1,Big Bang Theory,137,26
4029,Howard,16, We can't go home. ,1,Big Bang Theory,19,4
4030,Leonard,16, Why not?,1,Big Bang Theory,9,2
4031,Howard,16," Becauth  Becauth-th-th. Brissket, Brissket! Water, need water. ",1,Big Bang Theory,64,7
4032,Leonard,16," Alright, I'll be right back. ",1,Big Bang Theory,30,5
4033,Howard,16," Penny, look, I've got a problem.",1,Big Bang Theory,33,6
4034,Penny,16," Yeah, well so do I, look you've got to stall Leonard a little longer.",1,Big Bang Theory,70,14
4035,Howard,16, I don't think I can. ,1,Big Bang Theory,22,5
4036,Penny,16," You have to, we all have to be there at the same time to yell â€œsurprise!â€ù ",1,Big Bang Theory,79,16
4037,Howard,16," Okay, you have to understand something, we're in a hospital right now. ",1,Big Bang Theory,72,12
4038,Penny,16," Why, is Leonard okay.",1,Big Bang Theory,22,4
4039,Howard,16," Leonard's fine. I'm fine, thanks for asking, by the way. ",1,Big Bang Theory,58,10
4040,Penny,16," Okay, I don't need your attitude, just hold him there a little longer. ",1,Big Bang Theory,72,13
4041,Howard,16," Look, I've done my best but he wants to go home and I don't know how to stop him. ",1,Big Bang Theory,83,19
4042,Penny,16," Okay, how about this. You keep him there a little longer and when you get to the party I'll point out which of my friends are easy. ",1,Big Bang Theory,133,27
4043,Howard,16," Don't toy with me, woman. ",1,Big Bang Theory,27,5
4044,Penny,16," I've got a hot former fat girl with no self-esteem, I've got a girl who punishes her father by sleeping around and an alcoholic who's two tequila shots away from letting you wear her like a hat. ",1,Big Bang Theory,196,37
4045,Howard,16," Thy will be done.  I'm doing this for you, little buddy. ",1,Big Bang Theory,58,11
4047,Sheldon,16," Okay, we don't have that in stock, but I can special order it for you.",1,Big Bang Theory,71,15
4048,Penny,16, Him.,1,Big Bang Theory,5,1
4050,Sheldon,16," Yes, well, apparently neither does anyone else. ",1,Big Bang Theory,49,7
4051,Penny,16," Sheldon, we have to go.",1,Big Bang Theory,24,5
4052,Sheldon,16, Why? ,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
4053,Penny,16," Well, for one thing, we're late for Leonard's birthday party. And for another, I told him to call security. ",1,Big Bang Theory,109,19
4054,Sheldon,16," Good luck.  By the way, a six year-old could hack your computer system. ",1,Big Bang Theory,73,13
4055,Penny,16, Keep walking.,1,Big Bang Theory,14,2
4056,Sheldon,16," Yeah, 1-2-3-4 is not a secure password. ",1,Big Bang Theory,41,7
4058,Leonard,16," Excuse me, my friend is having an allergic reaction to peanuts.",1,Big Bang Theory,64,11
4060,Leonard,16, Yes he is.,1,Big Bang Theory,11,3
4062,Howard,16, Pees hep me! ,1,Big Bang Theory,14,3
4064,Howard,16, Fank-u. ,1,Big Bang Theory,9,1
4066,Leonard,16," Say what you will about the healthcare system in this country, but when they're afraid of lawsuits they sure test everything. ",1,Big Bang Theory,127,21
4067,Howard,16, I really don't think the colonoscopy was necessary. ,1,Big Bang Theory,53,8
4068,Leonard,16," You know, before you got all swollen up, I actually thought you were trying to keep me out of the apartment so you could throw me a surprise party. ",1,Big Bang Theory,149,29
4069,Howard,16," Oh, right, it's your birthday, I had no idea it was your birthday, I completely forgot, wow, what a lousy way to spend a birthday, well it's all over now.",1,Big Bang Theory,155,30
4070,Leonard,16," There is a party, isn't there.",1,Big Bang Theory,31,6
4071,Howard,16, Maybe.,1,Big Bang Theory,7,1
4072,Leonard,16, Howard. ,1,Big Bang Theory,9,1
4073,Howard,16, Are you mad?,1,Big Bang Theory,13,3
4074,Leonard,16, how could I be mad? You actually risked your life because you cared about me.,1,Big Bang Theory,78,15
4075,Howard,16," Yeah, that's why I did it. ",1,Big Bang Theory,28,6
4076,Leonard,16, Alright. Here we go. My first birthday party. ,1,Big Bang Theory,47,8
4077,Raj,16, Dude! Everybody left an hour ago! Surprise! ,1,Big Bang Theory,45,7
4078,Raj,16," Okay Leonard, here I am at your birthday party, I don't know where you are dude, but it's really kick-ass. Everyone is very very drunk, and uh  Oh look, there's a girl taking her shirt off. ",1,Big Bang Theory,191,36
4079,Penny,16," That's my friend Carol. Remind me, I've got to introduce her to Howard. ",1,Big Bang Theory,73,13
4080,Raj,16," Oh sweet Krishna, shake it, that-a rupee maker.",1,Big Bang Theory,48,8
4081,Penny,16, I'm so sorry you didn't get your party.,1,Big Bang Theory,40,8
4082,Leonard,16," Oh, it's okay.",1,Big Bang Theory,15,3
4083,Penny,16, Happy birthday anyways. ,1,Big Bang Theory,25,3
4084,Leonard,16," Hey Penny, when, uh, when's your birthday?",1,Big Bang Theory,43,7
4086,Sheldon,17, Wo de zhing shi Sheldon.,1,Big Bang Theory,25,5
4087,Howard,17," No, it's Wo de ming zi shi Sheldon. ",1,Big Bang Theory,37,8
4088,Sheldon,17, Wo de ming zi shi Sheldon. ,1,Big Bang Theory,28,6
4089,Howard,17, What's this? ,1,Big Bang Theory,14,2
4090,Sheldon,17, That's what you did. I assumed as in a number of languages that the gesture was part of the phrase.,1,Big Bang Theory,100,20
4091,Howard,17, Well it's not.,1,Big Bang Theory,15,3
4092,Sheldon,17, How am I supposed to know that? As the teacher it's your obligation to separate your personal idiosyncrasies from the subject matter. ,1,Big Bang Theory,135,22
4093,Howard,17," You know, I'm really glad you decided to learn Mandarin.",1,Big Bang Theory,57,10
4094,Sheldon,17, Why?,1,Big Bang Theory,5,1
4095,Howard,17, Once you're fluent you'll have a billion more people to annoy instead of me. ,1,Big Bang Theory,78,14
4096,Leonard,17, Hey! ,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
4097,Sheldon,17, Mai du lui tsa.,1,Big Bang Theory,16,4
4098,Howard,17, You just called Leonard a syphilitic donkey. ,1,Big Bang Theory,46,7
4099,Sheldon,17," My apologies Leonard, I'm only as good as my teacher. ",1,Big Bang Theory,55,10
4100,Leonard,17, Why are you learning Chinese?,1,Big Bang Theory,30,5
4101,Sheldon,17, I believe the Szechuan Palace has been passing off orange chicken as tangerine chicken and I intend to confront them. ,1,Big Bang Theory,119,20
4102,Leonard,17," If I were you, I'd be more concerned by what they're passing off as chicken. ",1,Big Bang Theory,78,15
4103,Penny,17, I need to use your window.,1,Big Bang Theory,27,6
4104,Leonard,17," Oh, yeah, no, sure, go ahead. ",1,Big Bang Theory,31,6
4105,Penny,17," Hey Jerkface, you forgot your iPod! ",1,Big Bang Theory,37,6
4106,Leonard,17, What's going on?,1,Big Bang Theory,17,3
4107,Penny,17," Oh, I'll tell you what's going on, that stupid self-centred bastard wrote about our sex life in his blog.  Drop dead, you stupid self-centred bastard!  Thank you. ",1,Big Bang Theory,164,27
4108,Sheldon,17," Okay, where were we? ",1,Big Bang Theory,22,4
4109,Howard,17," Not now, I have a blog to find. ",1,Big Bang Theory,33,8
4111,Leonard,17," Penny, are you okay?",1,Big Bang Theory,21,4
4112,Penny,17," I'm fine, Leonard, just go away.",1,Big Bang Theory,33,6
4113,Leonard,17," Look, I understand that breaking up with someone can be very painful.",1,Big Bang Theory,70,12
4114,Penny,17, GO AWAY!,1,Big Bang Theory,9,2
4115,Leonard,17," Okay, feel better, bye.  She doesn't want to talk. ",1,Big Bang Theory,52,9
4116,Sheldon,17," Not surprising. Penny's emotional responses originate from the primitive portion of the brain known as the Amygdala, while speech is centred in the much more recently developed Neocortex. The former can easily overpower the latter giving scientific credence to the notion of being rendered speechless.  Or maybe she just doesn't want to talk. ",1,Big Bang Theory,344,53
4117,Raj,17," Hey, look, I found an iPod. ",1,Big Bang Theory,29,6
4118,Howard,17," It's smashed beyond repair, what are you going to do with it?",1,Big Bang Theory,62,12
4119,Raj,17, What else? Sell it on ebay as slightly used. ,1,Big Bang Theory,46,9
4120,Leonard,17," It was Penny's boyfriend's, they broke up.",1,Big Bang Theory,43,7
4121,Howard,17," Apparently he posted intimate details of their physical relationship on his blog, which I cannot find anywhere. ",1,Big Bang Theory,113,17
4122,Leonard,17," You know what, I'm going to go back and try talking to her again.",1,Big Bang Theory,66,14
4123,Howard,17," Good idea. Sit with her, hold her, comfort her, and if the moment feels right, see if you can cop a feel. ",1,Big Bang Theory,107,22
4124,Leonard,17," I'm not going to do that, Howard.",1,Big Bang Theory,34,7
4125,Sheldon,17, I'm not aware of any social convention that requires you to intervene at all.,1,Big Bang Theory,78,14
4126,Leonard,17, What about â€œdamsel in distress?â€ù,1,Big Bang Theory,37,5
4127,Sheldon,17," Twelfth century code of chivalry, not exactly current. You'd also have to be knighted for that to apply. ",1,Big Bang Theory,106,18
4128,Leonard,17," I don't care. She's upset, I'm going over there. ",1,Big Bang Theory,50,9
4129,Howard,17, Remember to sit on your hands a bit so they're warm. ,1,Big Bang Theory,54,11
4130,Leonard,17," I'm her friend, I'm not going to take advantage of her vulnerability.",1,Big Bang Theory,70,12
4131,Howard,17," What, so you're saying that if in the depths of despair she throws herself at you and demands you take her, right there, right now, you'll just walk away?",1,Big Bang Theory,155,29
4132,Leonard,17, I said I'm her friend. Not her gay friend. ,1,Big Bang Theory,44,9
4134,Leonard,17," Hey, listen, I know you said that you didn't want to talk",1,Big Bang Theory,58,12
4135,Penny,17, I don't. ,1,Big Bang Theory,10,2
4136,Leonard,17, Sorry.,1,Big Bang Theory,7,1
4137,Penny,17, Wait. ,1,Big Bang Theory,7,1
4138,Leonard,17," Wait, did you say wait?",1,Big Bang Theory,24,5
4139,Penny,17, Tell me the truth. Am I just an idiot who picks giant losers? ,1,Big Bang Theory,63,13
4140,Leonard,17, No. No. ,1,Big Bang Theory,9,2
4141,Penny,17," Okay, so I pick good guys, but turn them into losers. ",1,Big Bang Theory,55,11
4142,Leonard,17, Of course not.,1,Big Bang Theory,15,3
4143,Penny,17," Well, it's got to be one or the other, which is it?",1,Big Bang Theory,52,12
4144,Leonard,17," I'm sorry, what were the choices again? ",1,Big Bang Theory,41,7
4145,Penny,17," I really thought Mike was different, I thought he was sensitive and smart. I mean, not you smart, normal non-freaky smart. ",1,Big Bang Theory,124,21
4146,Leonard,17," Yeah, no, sure.",1,Big Bang Theory,16,3
4147,Penny,17," You know, and then he just goes and has to humiliate me by writing about me on his blog so the entire world can read it.",1,Big Bang Theory,121,26
4148,Leonard,17, Actually it's not all that easy to find. ,1,Big Bang Theory,42,8
4149,Penny,17," Yeah, really, well my friends at work found it, my sister found it, judging by my email a number of prisoners at the Michigan State Penitentiary found it. ",1,Big Bang Theory,156,28
4150,Leonard,17," Okay, well, what exactly did this guy write, not that I need to know the details of your sex life, I just thought. never mind. ",1,Big Bang Theory,128,25
4151,Penny,17," Nope, you know what, you might as well read it, everybody else has, go ahead. Oh God, I just feel so betrayed and embarrassed. I just want to crawl into a hole and die.",1,Big Bang Theory,169,34
4152,Leonard,17," Okay, well, you know, this isn't that bad. It just paints the picture of a very affectionate woman who's open to expressing her affection in non traditional locales. ",1,Big Bang Theory,167,28
4153,Penny,17, Oh God!,1,Big Bang Theory,8,2
4154,Leonard,17," Elevators, parks, movie theatres, out of curiosity, is this subway the transportation system or subway the sandwich shop? ",1,Big Bang Theory,123,18
4155,Penny,17, Sandwich shop.,1,Big Bang Theory,15,2
4156,Leonard,17, Doesn't that violate the health code?,1,Big Bang Theory,38,6
4157,Penny,17," No, at the sub shop we were only making out. ",1,Big Bang Theory,46,10
4158,Leonard,17, Huh. Okay. But my point is that you have absolutely no reason to be embarrassed. ,1,Big Bang Theory,82,15
4159,Penny,17," Really, do you think I overreacted?",1,Big Bang Theory,36,6
4160,Leonard,17, Maybe a little.,1,Big Bang Theory,16,3
4161,Penny,17," â€˜Cause I do that, I do overreact. Maybe I should call Mike and apologise.",1,Big Bang Theory,76,14
4162,Leonard,17," No. No, no, that, that would be underreacting. He did break the implied confidentiality of the bedroom and, in your case, the elevator, parks and fast food franchise.",1,Big Bang Theory,167,28
4163,Penny,17, Yes. You're right. I should just say I'm done with him. ,1,Big Bang Theory,57,11
4164,Leonard,17," Yes, you should, go ahead, say it. ",1,Big Bang Theory,36,7
4165,Penny,17, But I never gave the man a chance to explain. ,1,Big Bang Theory,47,10
4166,Leonard,17," What is there to explain, it's all right here, it's a betrayal. ",1,Big Bang Theory,65,12
4167,Penny,17," No, you were right the first time, this is a man who loves me, but in his own stupid way he was just trying to show people how he feels. ",1,Big Bang Theory,138,30
4168,Leonard,17, I'm pretty sure I never said that. ,1,Big Bang Theory,36,7
4169,Penny,17," No, you did better than that, you helped me see it on my own. ",1,Big Bang Theory,63,14
4170,Leonard,17," Aw, good for me. Where are you going?",1,Big Bang Theory,38,8
4171,Penny,17," I'm going over to Mike's. Leonard, thank you so much.",1,Big Bang Theory,54,10
4172,Leonard,17," Oh, sure. Huh, maybe I am her gay friend. ",1,Big Bang Theory,43,9
4174,Sheldon,17," Howard, I'm going to need another Mandarin lesson. I obviously didn't make my point with those people. ",1,Big Bang Theory,104,17
4175,Howard,17," For God's sake, Sheldon, if you don't like the tangerine chicken, don't order the tangerine chicken.",1,Big Bang Theory,101,16
4176,Sheldon,17," I like tangerine chicken, I'm not getting tangerine chicken.",1,Big Bang Theory,61,9
4177,Leonard,17, Can we please change the subject.,1,Big Bang Theory,34,6
4178,Raj,17, Sure. Tell us again how you screwed up and got Penny back together with her old boyfriend.,1,Big Bang Theory,91,17
4179,Leonard,17, Just roll the dice. ,1,Big Bang Theory,21,4
4180,Raj,17," Enslaved by warlocks, stay here till you roll 2, 4 or 67",1,Big Bang Theory,57,12
4181,Leonard,17," She was mad at him. She was done with him, the relationship was broken beyond repair and I walked over there and I fixed it!",1,Big Bang Theory,125,25
4182,Howard,17," Boy, that story gets better every time you hear it. ",1,Big Bang Theory,53,10
4183,Sheldon,17," Actually, I thought the first two renditions were far more compelling. Previously I felt sympathy for the Leonard character, now I just find him to be whiny and annoying. ",1,Big Bang Theory,172,29
4184,Leonard,17, Just eat your tangerine chicken. ,1,Big Bang Theory,34,5
4185,Sheldon,17," I'd love to, but I don't have tangerine chicken. ",1,Big Bang Theory,50,9
4186,Penny,17, Thank you so much for your stupid advice.  ,1,Big Bang Theory,44,8
4187,Raj,17, Incredible. You managed to screw up the screw-up. ,1,Big Bang Theory,51,8
4189,Leonard,17, I'm back. ,1,Big Bang Theory,11,2
4190,Penny,17, I'm sorry I yelled at you. It's not your fault. ,1,Big Bang Theory,49,10
4191,Leonard,17, What happened?,1,Big Bang Theory,15,2
4192,Penny,17," Well, I went over to Mike's to make up with him.",1,Big Bang Theory,49,11
4193,Leonard,17," Yeah, I know, I know that part. ",1,Big Bang Theory,33,7
4194,Penny,17, But he had already moved on.,1,Big Bang Theory,29,6
4195,Leonard,17," Already, that was quick.",1,Big Bang Theory,25,4
4196,Penny,17, That's what I said to the woman who had her legs wrapped around his neck. ,1,Big Bang Theory,75,15
4197,Leonard,17," Oh, Penny, I am so sorry.",1,Big Bang Theory,26,6
4198,Penny,17, How could he do that.,1,Big Bang Theory,22,5
4199,Leonard,17," Oh, well, you know, you did throw an 8 gig iPod yeah, no, how could he do that. ",1,Big Bang Theory,81,18
4200,Penny,17," I swear to God, I am done with guys like that. You know, macho, with the perfect body and the hair, and the money.",1,Big Bang Theory,115,24
4201,Leonard,17," Yeah, that must get old quick. ",1,Big Bang Theory,32,6
4202,Penny,17," You know, just once, I would like to go out with someone who is nice, and honest, and who actually cares about me. ",1,Big Bang Theory,116,23
4203,Leonard,17, What about me?,1,Big Bang Theory,15,3
4204,Penny,17, What about you what?,1,Big Bang Theory,21,4
4205,Leonard,17, What about if you went out with me?,1,Big Bang Theory,36,8
4206,Penny,17, Are you asking me out?,1,Big Bang Theory,23,5
4207,Leonard,17, Um yes I am asking you out. ,1,Big Bang Theory,29,7
4208,Penny,17, Wow.,1,Big Bang Theory,5,1
4209,Leonard,17, I was just going off your comment about the nice guy,1,Big Bang Theory,53,11
4210,Penny,17," No, I know, I got that. Yeah, totally.",1,Big Bang Theory,39,8
4211,Leonard,17," thing and honest but, it's no big deal",1,Big Bang Theory,39,8
4212,Penny,17, Yes. ,1,Big Bang Theory,6,1
4213,Leonard,17, Yes what? ,1,Big Bang Theory,11,2
4214,Penny,17," Yes, I will go out with you. ",1,Big Bang Theory,30,7
4215,Leonard,17, Really?,1,Big Bang Theory,8,1
4216,Penny,17," Yeah. Why not, I mean, what do I have to lose?",1,Big Bang Theory,47,11
4217,Leonard,17, Yeah. That's the spirit. ,1,Big Bang Theory,26,4
4219,Sheldon,17," Show me your citrus peels. Gei wo kan, ni jud di zi pei. Show me your citrus peels. Gei wo kan, ni jud di zi pei. Show me your",1,Big Bang Theory,127,29
4220,Penny,17, Sheldon.,1,Big Bang Theory,9,1
4221,Sheldon,17, Aieee ya! Xia si wo le. ,1,Big Bang Theory,25,6
4222,Penny,17," I'm sorry. Look, do you have a second.",1,Big Bang Theory,39,8
4223,Sheldon,17, A second what? Pair of underwear? ,1,Big Bang Theory,35,6
4224,Penny,17, I was just wondering if I could talk to you? It's about Leonard.,1,Big Bang Theory,65,13
4225,Sheldon,17, Why me? Why not Koothrappali or Wolowitz?,1,Big Bang Theory,42,7
4226,Penny,17," Well, Raj can't talk to me unless he's drunk, and Wolowitz is, you know, disgusting. ",1,Big Bang Theory,86,15
4227,Sheldon,17," Yes, I suppose he is. ",1,Big Bang Theory,23,5
4228,Penny,17," All I'm saying is, you know Leonard the best. ",1,Big Bang Theory,47,9
4229,Sheldon,17," Not necessarily. I'm often surprised by my lack of familiarity with Leonard. Just the other day I discovered, he not only has a loofah, he hides it. Why do you suppose a man would be ashamed of having a loofah? I myself prefer to have my excess epithelial cells slough off naturally, but I don't condemn those who seek to accelerate the process.  And until recently I had no idea that despite his lactose intolerance, he can tolerate small amounts of non-fat ice cream without producing a noxious gas that I maintain in the right concentration could be weaponised. ",1,Big Bang Theory,566,99
4230,Penny,17," Leonard might come home, can we talk in my apartment. ",1,Big Bang Theory,55,10
4231,Sheldon,17, We're not done? ,1,Big Bang Theory,17,3
4232,Penny,17, No.,1,Big Bang Theory,4,1
4233,Sheldon,17," Ach, why not? We're already through the looking glass anyway. ",1,Big Bang Theory,63,10
4234,Penny,17," Okay, so, here's the thing. I guess you're aware that Leonard asked me out. ",1,Big Bang Theory,77,14
4235,Sheldon,17," Well, he didn't actually say anything, but when he came back to the apartment he was doing a dance that brought to mind the happy hippos in Fantasia. ",1,Big Bang Theory,151,28
4236,Penny,17," Oh, that's nice. Anyhow, the thing I wanted to talk to you about is, you know, since Leonard and I have become friends, I was just want to sit down? ",1,Big Bang Theory,150,30
4237,Sheldon,17," Oh, I wish it were that simple. You see, I don't spend much time here and so I've never really chosen a place to sit. ",1,Big Bang Theory,119,25
4238,Penny,17," Well, choose.",1,Big Bang Theory,14,2
4239,Sheldon,17," There are a number of options and, I'm really not familiar enough with the cushion densities, air flow patterns and dispersion of sunlight to make an informed choice.",1,Big Bang Theory,167,28
4240,Penny,17," Alright, why don't you just pick one at random, and then if you don't like it you can sit somewhere else next time. ",1,Big Bang Theory,117,23
4241,Sheldon,17," No, no, that's crazy. You go ahead and talk while I figure it out. ",1,Big Bang Theory,68,14
4242,Penny,17," Okay. Um, here's the thing. So, I've known for a while now that Leonard has had a little crush on me",1,Big Bang Theory,101,21
4243,Sheldon,17," A little crush? Well I suppose so, in the same way Menelaus had a little crush on Helen of Troy. ",1,Big Bang Theory,98,20
4244,Penny,17," Alright, yeah, I don't really know who they are",1,Big Bang Theory,48,9
4245,Sheldon,17, Well Menelaus was the brother of Agamemnon,1,Big Bang Theory,43,7
4246,Penny,17," Yeah, I don't care, I don't care. The point is Leonard isn't the kind of guy I usually go out with.",1,Big Bang Theory,100,21
4247,Sheldon,17, Leonard isn't the kind of guy anyone usually goes out with. Would you be open to rotating the couch clockwise thirty degrees? ,1,Big Bang Theory,127,22
4248,Penny,17," No. What I'm saying is, Leonard might be different in a good way. Obviously my usual choices have not worked out so well. ",1,Big Bang Theory,123,23
4249,Sheldon,17," The last one worked out well for Koothrappali. He got a free iPod. Oh, glare! ",1,Big Bang Theory,79,15
4250,Penny,17," But on the other hand, if things don't go well with Leonard, I risk losing a really good friend. I mean, I guess he's not looking for a fling, he's the kind of guy that gets into a relationship for, I don't know, like you would say light years. ",1,Big Bang Theory,246,49
4251,Sheldon,17," I would not say that. No-one would say that, a light year is a unit of distance, not time. ",1,Big Bang Theory,92,19
4252,Penny,17, Thank you for the clarification. ,1,Big Bang Theory,34,5
4253,Sheldon,17," Draft. You see people hear the word year and they think duration. Foot pound has the same problem, that's a unit of work, not of weight.",1,Big Bang Theory,137,26
4254,Penny,17," Right, thanks.",1,Big Bang Theory,15,2
4255,Sheldon,17, It's a common mistake.,1,Big Bang Theory,23,4
4256,Penny,17, Not the first one I've made today. ,1,Big Bang Theory,36,7
4257,Sheldon,17, Okay. I think this will be my seat. ,1,Big Bang Theory,37,8
4258,Penny,17," Sheldon, do you have anything to say that has anything to do with, you know, what I'm talking about. ",1,Big Bang Theory,102,19
4259,Sheldon,17," Well, let's see. We might consider Schrodinger's Cat. ",1,Big Bang Theory,55,8
4260,Penny,17, Schrodinger? Is that the woman in 2A?,1,Big Bang Theory,38,7
4261,Sheldon,17," No. That's Mrs Grossinger. And she doesn't have a cat, she has a Mexican hairless, annoying little animal, yip yip yip yip",1,Big Bang Theory,123,22
4262,Penny,17, Sheldon! ,1,Big Bang Theory,10,1
4263,Sheldon,17," Sorry, you diverted me. Anyway, in 1935, Erwin Schrodinger, in an attempt to explain the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics, he proposed an experiment where a cat is placed in a box with a sealed vial of poison that will break open at a random time. Now, since no-one knows when or if the poison has been released, until the box is opened, the cat can be thought of as both alive and dead. ",1,Big Bang Theory,401,74
4264,Penny,17," I'm sorry, I don't get the point. ",1,Big Bang Theory,35,7
4265,Sheldon,17," Well of course you don't get it, I haven't made it yet. You'd have to be psychic to get it, and there's no such thing as psychic.",1,Big Bang Theory,130,27
4266,Penny,17," Sheldon, what's the point? ",1,Big Bang Theory,28,4
4267,Sheldon,17," Just like Schrodinger's Cat, your potential relationship with Leonard right now can be thought of as both good and bad. It is only by opening the box that you'll find out which it is. ",1,Big Bang Theory,185,34
4268,Penny,17," Okay, so you're saying I should go out with Leonard. ",1,Big Bang Theory,54,10
4269,Sheldon,17," No, no, no, no, no, no. Let me start again. In 1935, Erwin Schrodinger",1,Big Bang Theory,71,14
4271,Leonard,17, Two seats right there. ,1,Big Bang Theory,24,4
4272,Sheldon,17, Chong sho sha pwe.  Xie xie.  ,1,Big Bang Theory,31,6
4273,Leonard,17," Sheldon, I think I've made a mistake. ",1,Big Bang Theory,39,7
4274,Sheldon,17," I can see that. Unless you're planning on running a marathon, choosing both stuffing and mashed potatoes is a starch filled redundancy.",1,Big Bang Theory,136,22
4275,Leonard,17," No, it's about Penny.",1,Big Bang Theory,22,4
4276,Sheldon,17," A mistake involving Penny? Okay, you'll have to narrow it down. ",1,Big Bang Theory,65,11
4277,Leonard,17, I don't think I can go out with her tonight. ,1,Big Bang Theory,46,10
4278,Sheldon,17, Then don't.,1,Big Bang Theory,12,2
4279,Leonard,17, Other people would say â€œwhy not?â€ù ,1,Big Bang Theory,39,6
4280,Sheldon,17, Other people might be interested. ,1,Big Bang Theory,35,5
4281,Leonard,17, I'm going to talk anyway.,1,Big Bang Theory,26,5
4282,Sheldon,17, I assumed you would. ,1,Big Bang Theory,22,4
4283,Leonard,17," Now that I'm actually about to go out with Penny, I'm not excited, I'm nauseous. ",1,Big Bang Theory,82,15
4284,Sheldon,17," Ah, then your meal choice is appropriate. Starch absorbs fluid which reduces the amount of vomit available for violent expulsion. ",1,Big Bang Theory,131,20
4285,Leonard,17, Right.,1,Big Bang Theory,7,1
4286,Sheldon,17," You also made a common grammatical mistake, you said nauseous when you meant nauseated. But go on. ",1,Big Bang Theory,100,17
4287,Leonard,17," Sheldon, this date is probably my one chance with Penny, what happens if I blow it. ",1,Big Bang Theory,85,16
4288,Sheldon,17," Well, if we accept your premise, and also accept the highly improbable assumption that Penny is the only woman in the world for you then we can logically conclude that the result of blowing it would be that you end up a lonely, bitter old man with no progeny. The image of any number of evil lighthouse keepers from Scooby Doo cartoons comes to mind. ",1,Big Bang Theory,352,65
4289,Leonard,17, You're not helping. ,1,Big Bang Theory,21,3
4290,Sheldon,17," Alright, what response on my part would bring this conversation to a speedy conclusion?",1,Big Bang Theory,88,14
4291,Leonard,17, Tell me whether or not to go through with the date.,1,Big Bang Theory,52,11
4292,Sheldon,17, Schrodinger's Cat.,1,Big Bang Theory,19,2
4293,Leonard,17," Wow, that's brilliant.",1,Big Bang Theory,23,3
4294,Sheldon,17," You sound surprised. Mmm, hou zi shui zai li du.  ",1,Big Bang Theory,51,10
4296,Penny,17, Hi.,1,Big Bang Theory,4,1
4297,Leonard,17, Hi. ,1,Big Bang Theory,5,1
4298,Penny,17, come on in.,1,Big Bang Theory,12,3
4299,Leonard,17, Thank you. You look very nice.,1,Big Bang Theory,31,6
4300,Penny,17, Thank you. So do you. ,1,Big Bang Theory,23,5
4301,Leonard,17, I made an eight o'clock reservation.,1,Big Bang Theory,37,6
4302,Penny,17," Okay, great, listen, um, maybe we should talk first. ",1,Big Bang Theory,54,9
4303,Leonard,17," Oh. Okay. But before you say anything, have you ever heard of Schrodinger's Cat? ",1,Big Bang Theory,82,14
4304,Penny,17," Actually, I've heard far too much about Schrodinger's Cat. ",1,Big Bang Theory,60,9
4305,Leonard,17, Good.  ,1,Big Bang Theory,8,1
4306,Penny,17," Alright, the cat's alive, let's go to dinner. ",1,Big Bang Theory,47,8
4308,Sheldon,17, Show me your mucus! Your mucus! ,1,Big Bang Theory,33,6
4310,Sheldon,17, This is not a tangerine bicycle. ,1,Big Bang Theory,34,6
4312,Sheldon,17," No. Don't call the library. Show me your mucus.  Oxen are in my bed! Many, many oxen! Oy Vey!",1,Big Bang Theory,94,19
4314,Leonard,1," So you see, what you're eating is not technically yoghurt, because it doesn't have enough live acidophilus cultures. It's really just iced milk with carragenin added for thickness. ",2,Big Bang Theory,182,28
4315,Penny,1," Oh, that's very interesting.",2,Big Bang Theory,29,4
4316,Leonard,1, It's also not pink and has no berries.,2,Big Bang Theory,39,8
4317,Penny,1," Yeah, but it doesn't really answer my question.",2,Big Bang Theory,48,8
4318,Leonard,1, What was your question again?,2,Big Bang Theory,30,5
4319,Penny,1, Do you want some.,2,Big Bang Theory,18,4
4320,Leonard,1," Oh, right, no, I'm lactose intolerant.",2,Big Bang Theory,39,6
4321,Penny,1, Right.,2,Big Bang Theory,7,1
4322,Leonard,1," So, gas.",2,Big Bang Theory,9,2
4323,Penny,1, Got it. ,2,Big Bang Theory,9,2
4324,Leonard,1," Well, good night. ",2,Big Bang Theory,19,3
4325,Penny,1, What are you doing?,2,Big Bang Theory,20,4
4326,Leonard,1, There was a draft.,2,Big Bang Theory,19,4
4327,Penny,1, I didn't feel a draft. ,2,Big Bang Theory,24,5
4328,Leonard,1, Why don't we just go into your.,2,Big Bang Theory,32,7
4329,Penny,1," Oh, yeah, you know what, maybe we should just slow things down a little.",2,Big Bang Theory,73,14
4330,Leonard,1," No, no, I didn't mean to go into your apartment to go fast. ",2,Big Bang Theory,61,13
4331,Penny,1," No, I know, I I know what you meant, it's just it's only our first date.",2,Big Bang Theory,73,16
4332,Leonard,1," Yeah, okay, sure, no problem, why don't we just figure out where we're going, and when we want to get there, and then rate of speed equals distance over time. Solve for R.",2,Big Bang Theory,172,33
4333,Penny,1, Or we could just wing it. ,2,Big Bang Theory,27,6
4334,Leonard,1, That might work too. ,2,Big Bang Theory,22,4
4335,Penny,1, Goodnight Leonard.,2,Big Bang Theory,19,2
4336,Leonard,1, Goodnight.  ,2,Big Bang Theory,13,1
4337,Raj,1, He's coming. Screen saver. ,2,Big Bang Theory,28,4
4338,Howard,1," Oh, hey, Leonard, how was your date?",2,Big Bang Theory,37,7
4339,Leonard,1," Bite me. Sheldon, how could you just sit there and let them spy on me?",2,Big Bang Theory,71,15
4340,Sheldon,1," They were clever, Leonard. They exploited my complete lack of interest in what you were doing. ",2,Big Bang Theory,96,16
4341,Howard,1," You should thank us. When future generations try to determine why your relationship with Penny crashed and burned, this right here is the black box. ",2,Big Bang Theory,150,25
4342,Leonard,1," What are you talking about, the date went fine. ",2,Big Bang Theory,49,9
4343,Raj,1," Dude, she said she wants to slow things down.",2,Big Bang Theory,46,9
4344,Leonard,1," Okay, so, she said she wants to slow things down. It's like saying â€œI'm really enjoying this meal, I'm going to slow down and savour it.â€ù ",2,Big Bang Theory,143,26
4345,Howard,1," No, it's like â€œthis fish tastes bad, so I'm going to slow down and spit it out.â€ù",2,Big Bang Theory,85,17
4346,Raj,1, You being the fish.,2,Big Bang Theory,20,4
4347,Leonard,1, I'm not the fish. ,2,Big Bang Theory,19,4
4348,Howard,1," Oh really, did you make a second date.",2,Big Bang Theory,39,8
4349,Leonard,1," Well, we sort of decided to wing it. ",2,Big Bang Theory,38,8
4350,Sheldon,1," Oh, even I know that's lame. ",2,Big Bang Theory,30,6
4351,Leonard,1," Okay, alright, let's assume your hypothesis. We went to dinner, we talked, we laughed, we kissed, where could I have possibly gone wrong. ",2,Big Bang Theory,139,23
4352,Howard,1," Think back, Leonard, the littlest things can set women off. Like, hey, the waitress is hot, I bet we could get her to come home with us. Or, how much does your mom weigh, I want to know what I'm getting into.",2,Big Bang Theory,209,42
4353,Leonard,1, I didn't say anything like that.,2,Big Bang Theory,33,6
4354,Howard,1," Good, â€˜cos they don't work. ",2,Big Bang Theory,31,5
4355,Raj,1," They also don't care for it if you stare at them and hyperventilate. Sadly, that's my home run swing. ",2,Big Bang Theory,103,19
4356,Leonard,1," Look, everything went fine. I didn't even have to refer to my impromptu conversation starters. The woman across the hall is into me. ",2,Big Bang Theory,134,23
4357,Howard,1," Let's go to the tape. Look at her reaction to the goodnight kiss, no change in respiration, pupils un-dilated, no flushing of the chest.",2,Big Bang Theory,137,24
4358,Raj,1," Nice close up, by the way. ",2,Big Bang Theory,28,6
4359,Sheldon,1," Interesting, her jaws are clenched, no tongue access, clearly a bad sign amongst mating humans. ",2,Big Bang Theory,97,15
4360,Leonard,1, That's not a bad sign.,2,Big Bang Theory,23,5
4361,Sheldon,1," Please, you might as well have been two iguana with no dewlap enlargement. ",2,Big Bang Theory,76,13
4362,Raj,1," And the worst sign of all is, you're here and not there. ",2,Big Bang Theory,58,12
4363,Leonard,1," I'm not there because I'm taking things slow. Which, by the way, compared to you guys approaches warp speed. And take down that camera. ",2,Big Bang Theory,137,24
4364,Raj,1, He was a lot more fun when he had no hope. ,2,Big Bang Theory,44,11
4365,Howard,1, Give him time.,2,Big Bang Theory,15,3
4367,Penny,1, Hi.,2,Big Bang Theory,4,1
4368,Sheldon,1," Oh, hi Penny. FYI, the hot water is inadequate on machine 2 so colours only, and 4 is still releasing the fabric softener too early in the cycle so I'd avoid using that for your delicates. ",2,Big Bang Theory,190,36
4369,Penny,1, Thanks. ,2,Big Bang Theory,9,1
4370,Sheldon,1," Oh, good Lord. Why don't you just take your clothes down to the river and beat them with a rock? ",2,Big Bang Theory,98,20
4371,Penny,1," Sheldon, may I ask you a question? ",2,Big Bang Theory,36,7
4372,Sheldon,1," I would prefer that you not, but I won't go so far as to forbid it. ",2,Big Bang Theory,69,16
4373,Penny,1," Alright, I heard yes, so okay, here's my question, has Leonard ever dated, you know, a regular girl. ",2,Big Bang Theory,102,18
4374,Sheldon,1, Well I assume you're not referring to digestive regularity? Because I've come to learn that such inquiries are inappropriate. ,2,Big Bang Theory,127,19
4375,Penny,1," No, I meant has he ever been involved with someone who wasn't a braniac? ",2,Big Bang Theory,74,14
4376,Sheldon,1," Oh. Well, a few years ago he did go out with a woman who had a PhD in French Literature. ",2,Big Bang Theory,90,20
4377,Penny,1, How is that not a braniac? ,2,Big Bang Theory,28,6
4378,Sheldon,1," Well, for one thing, she was French. For another, it was literature. ",2,Big Bang Theory,70,12
4379,Penny,1," So, do you think that if Leonard and I keep dating he'll eventually get bored with me. ",2,Big Bang Theory,88,17
4380,Sheldon,1, That depends.,2,Big Bang Theory,14,2
4381,Penny,1, On what? ,2,Big Bang Theory,10,2
4382,Sheldon,1, Do you have a working knowledge of quantum physics? ,2,Big Bang Theory,53,9
4383,Penny,1, No.,2,Big Bang Theory,4,1
4384,Sheldon,1, Do you speak Klingon? ,2,Big Bang Theory,23,4
4385,Penny,1, No.,2,Big Bang Theory,4,1
4386,Sheldon,1, Do you know any card tricks?,2,Big Bang Theory,29,6
4387,Penny,1," Okay, okay, you know, I get it, Leonard has no business being involved with a waitress slash actress who felt so insecure that she lied to him about finishing community college. ",2,Big Bang Theory,179,31
4388,Sheldon,1, Why would you lie about that?,2,Big Bang Theory,30,6
4389,Penny,1," Well, he was going on and on about this college and that grad school and I didn't want him to think I was some stupid loser. ",2,Big Bang Theory,126,26
4390,Sheldon,1, You thought the opposite of stupid loser was community college graduate? ,2,Big Bang Theory,74,11
4391,Penny,1," You know, there are a lot of successful people in this country who are community college graduates. ",2,Big Bang Theory,101,17
4392,Sheldon,1," Yeah, but you were neither. ",2,Big Bang Theory,29,5
4393,Penny,1," Right, okay look, this is between you and me, you cannot tell Leonard any of this. ",2,Big Bang Theory,84,16
4394,Sheldon,1, You're asking me to keep a secret?,2,Big Bang Theory,35,7
4395,Penny,1, Yeah. ,2,Big Bang Theory,7,1
4396,Sheldon,1," Well I'm sorry, but you would have had to express that desire before revealing the secret, so that I could choose whether or not I wanted to accept the covenant of secret keeping. You can't impose a secret on an ex post facto basis. ",2,Big Bang Theory,234,44
4397,Penny,1, What? ,2,Big Bang Theory,7,1
4398,Sheldon,1," Secret keeping is a complicated endeavour. One has to be concerned not only about what one says, but about facial expression, autonomic reflexes, when I try to deceive, I myself have more nervous tics than a lyme disease research facility.  It's a joke. It relies on the hominymic relationship between tick the blood-sucking arachnid, and tic the involuntary muscular contraction. I made it up myself. ",2,Big Bang Theory,403,65
4399,Penny,1," Okay, look, if Leonard finds out that I lied, I will absolutely die of embarrassment. ",2,Big Bang Theory,87,15
4400,Sheldon,1, Physiologically impossible.,2,Big Bang Theory,28,2
4401,Penny,1," Oh Sheldon, please, look, I'm asking you as a friend. ",2,Big Bang Theory,55,10
4402,Sheldon,1, So you're saying that friendship contains within it an inherent obligation to maintain confidences?,2,Big Bang Theory,100,14
4403,Penny,1," Well, yeah. ",2,Big Bang Theory,13,2
4404,Sheldon,1," Interesting. See, one more question, and perhaps I should have led with this, when did we become friends? ",2,Big Bang Theory,107,18
4406,Sheldon,1," I.e, I couldn't become Green Lantern unless I was chosen by the guardians of Oa, but given enough start-up capital and an adequate research facility, I could be Batman.",2,Big Bang Theory,169,29
4407,Leonard,1, You could be Batman?,2,Big Bang Theory,21,4
4408,Sheldon,1, Sure.  I'm Batman. See.,2,Big Bang Theory,24,4
4409,Penny,1, Hi guys.,2,Big Bang Theory,9,2
4410,Leonard,1, Hey.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
4411,Sheldon,1, Hi Penny.,2,Big Bang Theory,10,2
4412,Leonard,1," Hey, Penny, if you're not doing anything Friday night I thought maybe we could go and see a movie. ",2,Big Bang Theory,100,19
4413,Penny,1," Oh, um, you know, I think I have the dinner shift on Friday.",2,Big Bang Theory,61,13
4414,Leonard,1, What about Saturday?,2,Big Bang Theory,21,3
4415,Penny,1," You know, I'm not sure, the manager hasn't posted the schedule yet, how about I let you know.",2,Big Bang Theory,94,18
4416,Leonard,1," Great. So you just let me know when you know. So  Oh God, I am the bad fish! What did I do wrong?",2,Big Bang Theory,98,23
4417,Sheldon,1," Why are you asking me, I have no information about your interactions with Penny other than what you provided me, nor do I have any method of learning such things.  ",2,Big Bang Theory,165,30
4418,Leonard,1, What does that mean?,2,Big Bang Theory,21,4
4419,Sheldon,1, Nothing. You seem to be implying an informational back channel between me and Penny where obviously none exists.,2,Big Bang Theory,113,18
4420,Leonard,1, No I didn't.,2,Big Bang Theory,13,3
4421,Sheldon,1," I just think you need to be careful how you phrase things, sir. ",2,Big Bang Theory,65,13
4422,Leonard,1, What's going on with you?,2,Big Bang Theory,26,5
4423,Sheldon,1, Well I might ask you the same question. Why do you insist on attempting to drag me into matters which have nothing to do with me? But exist between you and Penny. A person to whom I barely speak.  ,2,Big Bang Theory,198,39
4424,Leonard,1, What's wrong with your face? ,2,Big Bang Theory,30,5
4425,Sheldon,1," There's no reason to bring my looks into this. Good day, Leonard.",2,Big Bang Theory,66,12
4426,Leonard,1, What? ,2,Big Bang Theory,7,1
4427,Sheldon,1, I said Good Day! ,2,Big Bang Theory,18,4
4428,Leonard,1, Good day? ,2,Big Bang Theory,11,2
4430,Penny,1," Also today we have a fresh caught Alaska salmon, and that's served with a teriyaki glaze and sticky rice. Our soup of the day",2,Big Bang Theory,126,24
4431,Sheldon,1, You must release me from my oath. ,2,Big Bang Theory,35,7
4432,Penny,1," Sheldon, I'm working.",2,Big Bang Theory,22,3
4433,Sheldon,1, Why don't you take a minute to decide  I can't keep your secret Penny. I'm going to fold like an energy based anobo protein in conformational space. Like a renaissance triptych. Like a cheap suit.,2,Big Bang Theory,197,35
4434,Penny,1," Oh, look, why is it so hard for you to keep one little secret?",2,Big Bang Theory,63,14
4435,Sheldon,1," I'm constitutionally incapable. That's why I was refused clearance for a very prestigious government research fellowship at a secret military supercollider, located beneath a fake agricultural station 12.5 miles south east of Travers City, Michigan. Which you did not hear about from me. ",2,Big Bang Theory,289,43
4436,Penny,1," Look, just forget I told you about me not graduating from community college. Okay?",2,Big Bang Theory,83,14
4437,Sheldon,1, Forget! You want me to forget? This mind does not forget. I haven't forgotten a single thing since the day my mother stopped breast feeding me. It was a drizzly Tuesday.,2,Big Bang Theory,170,31
4438,Penny,1," Okay, look, you promised me you would keep my secret so you're just going to have to figure out a way to do it.",2,Big Bang Theory,112,24
4440,Sheldon,1," Leonard, I'm moving out. ",2,Big Bang Theory,26,4
4441,Leonard,1," What do you mean, you're moving out? Why? ",2,Big Bang Theory,43,8
4442,Sheldon,1, There doesn't have to be a reason. ,2,Big Bang Theory,36,7
4443,Leonard,1," Yeah, there kind of does.",2,Big Bang Theory,26,5
4444,Sheldon,1," Not necessarily. This is a classic example of munchausen's trilemma. Either the reason is predicated on a series of sub-reasons leading to an infinite regression, or it tracks back to arbitrary axiomatic statements, or it's ultimately circular, i.e., I'm moving out because I'm moving out. ",2,Big Bang Theory,291,45
4445,Leonard,1, I'm still confused.,2,Big Bang Theory,20,3
4446,Sheldon,1," Leonard, I don't see how I could have made it any simpler. ",2,Big Bang Theory,60,12
4447,Howard,1," Hey, qu'est q'wass up?",2,Big Bang Theory,23,4
4448,Raj,1, We just got back from that exhibit of those plasticised human cadavers.,2,Big Bang Theory,72,12
4449,Howard,1, And some of those skinless chicks were hot. ,2,Big Bang Theory,45,8
4450,Sheldon,1," If you'll excuse me, I'm going to pack. ",2,Big Bang Theory,41,8
4451,Howard,1, That's kind of an overreaction to a little harmless necrophilia. ,2,Big Bang Theory,66,10
4452,Leonard,1," It's not you, Howard, he says he's moving out. ",2,Big Bang Theory,48,9
4453,Raj,1, What did you do? Did you change the contrast or brightness settings on the television?,2,Big Bang Theory,87,15
4454,Leonard,1, No.,2,Big Bang Theory,4,1
4455,Raj,1, Did you take a band aid off in front of him? ,2,Big Bang Theory,46,11
4456,Leonard,1, No.,2,Big Bang Theory,4,1
4457,Howard,1," Did you buy generic ketchup, forget to rinse the sink, talk to him through the bathroom door? ",2,Big Bang Theory,95,17
4458,Raj,1," Adjust the thermostat, cook with cilantro, pronounce the T in often? ",2,Big Bang Theory,70,11
4459,Leonard,1, No. ,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
4460,Howard,1, Did you make fun of trains? ,2,Big Bang Theory,29,6
4461,Leonard,1," I didn't do anything, he's just gone insane.",2,Big Bang Theory,45,8
4462,Raj,1," Well, we all knew this day was coming. ",2,Big Bang Theory,40,8
4463,Leonard,1, That was fast. ,2,Big Bang Theory,16,3
4464,Sheldon,1, It's my pre-packed disaster evacuation bag. Recommended by the department of homeland security. And Sarah Connor. ,2,Big Bang Theory,115,16
4465,Leonard,1, Where are you gonna live? ,2,Big Bang Theory,27,5
4466,Sheldon,1, Until I find a permanent place I will stay with friends. ,2,Big Bang Theory,58,11
4467,Howard,1, Bye  ,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
4468,Raj,1," Well you can't stay with me, I have a teeny tiny apartment. ",2,Big Bang Theory,61,12
4469,Sheldon,1," Excuse me, but isn't hosting guests an aspect of Menushya Yajna, one of the five central religious duties or sacrifices of the Hindu householder? ",2,Big Bang Theory,147,24
4470,Raj,1, I hate trains. ,2,Big Bang Theory,16,3
4471,Sheldon,1," Don't be ridiculous, you love trains. ",2,Big Bang Theory,39,6
4472,Raj,1," Yes I do, come on. See you later Leonard. ",2,Big Bang Theory,43,9
4473,Leonard,1, This could work. ,2,Big Bang Theory,18,3
4475,Sheldon,1, This is a very old building. ,2,Big Bang Theory,30,6
4476,Raj,1, Sixty years. Used to be a watch factory. ,2,Big Bang Theory,42,8
4477,Sheldon,1, Uh-oh.,2,Big Bang Theory,7,1
4478,Raj,1, What? ,2,Big Bang Theory,7,1
4479,Sheldon,1, Don't you worry about the residual radium from the luminous dials?,2,Big Bang Theory,67,11
4480,Raj,1, Not until now. ,2,Big Bang Theory,16,3
4481,Sheldon,1," I can't believe I didn't bring my gieger counter. You know, I had it on my bed and I didn't pack it. ",2,Big Bang Theory,102,22
4482,Raj,1," Well, if you're not comfortable staying here, Sheldon",2,Big Bang Theory,54,8
4483,Sheldon,1," I'm kidding, I packed it. It was a joke, I was subverting the conversational expectations. I believe they call that the, um, old switcheroo. ",2,Big Bang Theory,142,24
4484,Raj,1, Terrific. ,2,Big Bang Theory,11,1
4485,Sheldon,1, Is that woman Aishwarya Rai?,2,Big Bang Theory,29,5
4486,Raj,1," Yes, isn't she an amazing actress.",2,Big Bang Theory,35,6
4487,Sheldon,1," Actually, I'd say she's a poor man's Madhuri Dixit. ",2,Big Bang Theory,53,9
4488,Raj,1, How dare you. Aishwarya Rai is a Goddess. By comparison Madhuri Dixit is a leprous prostitute.,2,Big Bang Theory,95,16
4489,Sheldon,1," Sorry, I didn't mean to offend you. Obviously you're not that familiar with Indian cinema. ",2,Big Bang Theory,92,15
4491,Howard,1, Who is it?,2,Big Bang Theory,11,3
4493,Raj,1, Tag. You're it.  ,2,Big Bang Theory,18,3
4494,Howard,1, Shouldn't you have put him in a brown paper bag and set him on fire? ,2,Big Bang Theory,70,15
4496,Sheldon,1, I've never slept on an air mattress before. No lumbar support whatsoever. ,2,Big Bang Theory,75,12
4497,Howard,1, Maybe you'd be happier on a park bench? ,2,Big Bang Theory,41,8
4498,Sheldon,1, I don't see any way to get a park bench in here.,2,Big Bang Theory,49,12
4499,Howard,1, Do you want to switch?,2,Big Bang Theory,23,5
4500,Sheldon,1," No, that's fine. I'm perfectly comfortable sleeping on a bouncy castle. ",2,Big Bang Theory,73,11
4501,Howard,1," Get out of bed, we're switching.",2,Big Bang Theory,33,6
4502,Sheldon,1," Now, only if you want to.",2,Big Bang Theory,26,6
4503,Howard,1, Just get in the bed!,2,Big Bang Theory,21,5
4505,Howard,1, We're just talking ma. ,2,Big Bang Theory,24,4
4507,Howard,1," For God's sake, ma, I'm 27 years old. It's not even a school night!  Comfy now?",2,Big Bang Theory,80,16
4508,Sheldon,1, Meh. That poster of Halle Berry's a little unnerving. ,2,Big Bang Theory,55,9
4509,Howard,1, So don't look at it.,2,Big Bang Theory,21,5
4510,Sheldon,1, She's like my fourth favourite catwoman.,2,Big Bang Theory,41,6
4511,Howard,1, No kidding?,2,Big Bang Theory,12,2
4512,Sheldon,1," Yeah, Julie Newmar, Michelle Pfieffer, Eartha Kitt and then her. ",2,Big Bang Theory,66,10
4513,Howard,1, What about Lee Meriwether?,2,Big Bang Theory,27,4
4514,Sheldon,1," Oh, I forgot about Lee Meriwether.",2,Big Bang Theory,35,6
4515,Howard,1, Well I'm glad that's settled. ,2,Big Bang Theory,31,5
4516,Sheldon,1," That makes Halle Berry my fifth favourite catwoman. There's Julie Newmar, Michelle Pfieffer, Eartha Kitt, Lee Meriwether",2,Big Bang Theory,121,17
4517,Howard,1," Please, I'm begging you, go to sleep.",2,Big Bang Theory,38,7
4518,Sheldon,1," I'm trying, I'm counting catwomen. She did make a fine mutant in the X-Men movies though.",2,Big Bang Theory,90,16
4519,Howard,1, Oh for God's sake.,2,Big Bang Theory,19,4
4520,Sheldon,1," But she's not my favourite of the X-Men, in order that would be Wolverine, Cyclops, oh wait, I forgot Professor X. Professor X, Wolverine, Cyclops, Iceman, then Storm, Angel, the Beast, oh wait, Nightcrawler. Professor X, Nightcrawler, Wolverine, Cyclops, Iceman, then Storm, Angel.",2,Big Bang Theory,283,43
4522,Leonard,1, I'm coming! ,2,Big Bang Theory,13,2
4523,Sheldon,1," Hey, there he is, there's my old buddy-bud-bud. ",2,Big Bang Theory,49,8
4524,Leonard,1, What's with him?,2,Big Bang Theory,17,3
4525,Howard,1," Koothrappali dumped him on me, and he couldn't get to sleep, so I gave him a glass of warm milk with a handful of my mom's valium in it. But he still wouldn't shut up, so, tag, you're it. ",2,Big Bang Theory,189,39
4526,Sheldon,1, I'm ba-ack!,2,Big Bang Theory,12,2
4527,Leonard,1, I still don't know why you left.,2,Big Bang Theory,33,7
4528,Sheldon,1, I can't tell you.,2,Big Bang Theory,18,4
4529,Leonard,1, Why not.,2,Big Bang Theory,9,2
4530,Sheldon,1, I promised Penny. ,2,Big Bang Theory,19,3
4531,Leonard,1, You promised Penny what? ,2,Big Bang Theory,26,4
4532,Sheldon,1, That I wouldn't tell you the secret. Shhhhh!,2,Big Bang Theory,45,8
4533,Leonard,1, What secret. Tell me the secret. ,2,Big Bang Theory,34,6
4534,Sheldon,1," Mom smokes in the car. Jesus is okay with it, but we can't tell Dad. ",2,Big Bang Theory,70,15
4535,Leonard,1," Not that secret, the other secret.",2,Big Bang Theory,35,6
4536,Sheldon,1, I'm Batman. Shhhhh!,2,Big Bang Theory,20,3
4537,Leonard,1," Dammit, Sheldon! You said Penny told you a secret, what was the secret.",2,Big Bang Theory,72,13
4538,Sheldon,1," Okay, I'll tell you, but you can't tell Leonard. ",2,Big Bang Theory,50,9
4539,Leonard,1, I promise. ,2,Big Bang Theory,12,2
4540,Sheldon,1, Penny lied about graduating from community college because she is afraid she's not smart enough for Leonard. ,2,Big Bang Theory,110,17
4541,Leonard,1, So it's nothing I did? It's her problem? ,2,Big Bang Theory,42,8
4542,Sheldon,1, I drank milk that tasted funny. ,2,Big Bang Theory,33,6
4543,Leonard,1," Penny thinks I'm too smart for her, that's ridiculous. ",2,Big Bang Theory,56,9
4544,Sheldon,1," I know, most of your work is extremely derivative. Don't worry, that's not a secret. Everybody knows. ",2,Big Bang Theory,103,17
4546,Penny,1, Hi.,2,Big Bang Theory,4,1
4547,Leonard,1," Yeah, hi, listen, I know what's been bothering you about us, and I have the answer. ",2,Big Bang Theory,85,16
4548,Penny,1, What are you talking about.,2,Big Bang Theory,28,5
4549,Leonard,1," First I want to say that it's not Sheldon's fault, he tried very hard to keep your secret, if Howard hadn't drugged him he would have taken it to his grave. ",2,Big Bang Theory,158,31
4550,Penny,1, He told you?,2,Big Bang Theory,13,3
4551,Leonard,1," Yes, but it's okay. Now that we know what the problem is, there's a simple solution.  ",2,Big Bang Theory,87,16
4552,Penny,1, Pasadena city college? ,2,Big Bang Theory,24,3
4553,Leonard,1," A place for fun, a place for knowledge. See, this man here's playing hacky sack, and this girl's going to be a paralegal. ",2,Big Bang Theory,123,23
4554,Penny,1," Wow, I get it, because Dr Leonard Hofstadter can't date a girl without a fancy college degree. ",2,Big Bang Theory,96,17
4555,Leonard,1," Well, it's really not that fancy, it's just a city college. ",2,Big Bang Theory,61,11
4556,Penny,1," Right, but I have to have some sort of degree to date you? ",2,Big Bang Theory,60,13
4557,Leonard,1, That doesn't matter to me at all.,2,Big Bang Theory,34,7
4558,Penny,1," So, it's fine with you if I'm not smart. ",2,Big Bang Theory,42,9
4559,Leonard,1," Absolutely.  Okay, this time I know where I went wrong.  Oh bite me! ",2,Big Bang Theory,70,13
4561,Sheldon,2, Worst Renaissance Fair ever.,2,Big Bang Theory,29,4
4562,Leonard,2," Please let it go, Sheldon.",2,Big Bang Theory,27,5
4563,Sheldon,2," It was rife with historical inaccuracies. For example, the tavern girl serving flagons of mead, now her costume was obviously Germanic, but in 1487 the Bavarian purity laws or Rhineheitsgebot severely limited the availability of mead. At best they would have had some sort of spiced wine.",2,Big Bang Theory,289,47
4564,Leonard,2, You're nitpicking.,2,Big Bang Theory,19,2
4565,Sheldon,2, Oh-ho! Really? Well here's another nit for you. The flagons would not have been made of polypropylene.,2,Big Bang Theory,103,17
4566,Howard,2, Renaissance fairs aren't about historical accuracy. They're about taking chubby girls who work at Kinko's and lacing them up in corsets so tight their bosom jumps out and says howdy.,2,Big Bang Theory,183,30
4567,Sheldon,2, Bosoms would not have said howdy in the fifteenth century. If anything they would have said â€œhuzzah!â€ù,2,Big Bang Theory,106,17
4568,Howard,2," I don't care what the bosoms say, Sheldon, I just want to be part of the conversation.",2,Big Bang Theory,87,17
4569,Penny,2, Hi guys. Looks like you've been to the Renaissance fair. I'm hoping.,2,Big Bang Theory,69,12
4570,Sheldon,2, Renaissance fair? More of a medieval slash age of enlightenment slash any excuse to wear a codpiece fair.,2,Big Bang Theory,106,18
4571,Penny,2," Okay, fine, whatever, um, you guys, this is my friend Eric.",2,Big Bang Theory,60,11
4572,Howard,2, Hello.,2,Big Bang Theory,7,1
4573,Leonard,2, Hi.,2,Big Bang Theory,4,1
4575,Leonard,2," So, yeah, good to see you.",2,Big Bang Theory,27,6
4576,Penny,2," Yeah, yeah, it's good to see you too. We should really go.",2,Big Bang Theory,59,12
4578,Penny,2, Bye guys.,2,Big Bang Theory,10,2
4580,Howard,2," Thanks, my mom made it. Penny with a new guy, tres awkward.",2,Big Bang Theory,60,12
4581,Leonard,2," It wasn't awkward. It wasn't fun. Besides, what's the big deal, we dated, we stopped dating, and now we're both moving on.",2,Big Bang Theory,123,22
4582,Raj,2," By moving on, do you mean, she's going out with other men and you spent the afternoon making fifteenth century soap with Wolowitz?",2,Big Bang Theory,131,23
4583,Sheldon,2," That was not fifteenth century soap, my God those people need to learn you can't just put â€œye oldeâ€ù in front of anything and expect to get away with it.",2,Big Bang Theory,157,30
4584,Leonard,2," Can we please just go in, my chain mail is stuck in my underwear.",2,Big Bang Theory,66,14
4585,Sheldon,2, You're wearing modern underwear?,2,Big Bang Theory,33,4
4586,Leonard,2," Relatively modern. Why, what are you wearing?",2,Big Bang Theory,46,7
4587,Sheldon,2, I fashioned historically accurate undergarments out of linen.,2,Big Bang Theory,62,8
4588,Leonard,2, You went out and bought linen?,2,Big Bang Theory,31,6
4589,Sheldon,2," Don't be silly, I borrowed one of your pillow cases.",2,Big Bang Theory,53,10
4590,Leonard,2, Borrowed?,2,Big Bang Theory,10,1
4592,Leonard,2," You know what, I'm happy that Penny's moving on. It gives me the freedom to move on myself.",2,Big Bang Theory,92,18
4593,Howard,2, Are you saying that you've been holding back?,2,Big Bang Theory,46,8
4594,Leonard,2, Of course. Out of respect.,2,Big Bang Theory,27,5
4595,Howard,2," So, how do you explain the ten years before Penny?",2,Big Bang Theory,51,10
4596,Raj,2, Who were you respecting then?,2,Big Bang Theory,30,5
4597,Leonard,2," What? I've dated plenty of women. There was Joyce Kim, Leslie Winkle.",2,Big Bang Theory,70,12
4598,Sheldon,2," Notify the editors of the Oxford English Dictionary, the word plenty has been redefined to mean two.",2,Big Bang Theory,101,17
4599,Leonard,2," Uh, what about that girl last year at Comic-con?",2,Big Bang Theory,49,9
4600,Raj,2, Doesn't count.,2,Big Bang Theory,15,2
4601,Leonard,2, Why not?,2,Big Bang Theory,9,2
4602,Raj,2," What happens in costume at Comic-con, stays at Comic-con.",2,Big Bang Theory,58,9
4603,Howard,2, You're only saying that because of what happened to you.,2,Big Bang Theory,57,10
4604,Leonard,2, What happened to you?,2,Big Bang Theory,22,4
4605,Raj,2, N-n-n-nothing happened to me.,2,Big Bang Theory,30,4
4606,Howard,2," It wasn't your fault, Raj, he was dressed as a green Orion slave girl.",2,Big Bang Theory,71,14
4607,Raj,2," H-h-h-how did we get on me, we were mocking Leonard for not moving on. Dude, you have totally not moved on.",2,Big Bang Theory,108,21
4608,Leonard,2," Yes I have, it's just a matter of actually making a date with someone.",2,Big Bang Theory,71,14
4609,Howard,2, Like who?,2,Big Bang Theory,10,2
4610,Leonard,2," Well, there's Joyce Kim, but she defected back to North Korea so it's a little geographically undesireable.",2,Big Bang Theory,108,17
4611,Raj,2, What about Leslie Winkle.,2,Big Bang Theory,26,4
4612,Sheldon,2, Oh no.,2,Big Bang Theory,7,2
4613,Raj,2, Why?,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
4614,Sheldon,2," Her research methodology is sloppy, she's unjustifiably arrogant about loop quantum gravity, and to make matters worse she's often mean to me.",2,Big Bang Theory,143,22
4615,Raj,2, I think she's smoking hot.,2,Big Bang Theory,27,5
4616,Howard,2, I'd hit that.,2,Big Bang Theory,14,3
4617,Sheldon,2, You'd hit particulate soil on a colloidal suspension. Mud.,2,Big Bang Theory,59,9
4618,Leonard,2," Look, I like Leslie, but she's not interested in dating as much as using men as tools for stress release.",2,Big Bang Theory,106,20
4619,Howard,2," Yeah, so, be a tool. Go get yourself a little rebound stress release.",2,Big Bang Theory,70,13
4620,Raj,2, Technically it would only be rebound if he and Penny had actually engaged in physical intimacy.,2,Big Bang Theory,96,16
4621,Howard,2, You mean like you and Richard the slave girl?,2,Big Bang Theory,46,9
4622,Raj,2," I bought him dinner and we kissed once, that was it.  And he told me his name was Kimberley!",2,Big Bang Theory,93,19
4624,Sheldon,2, You know how I know we're not in The Matrix?,2,Big Bang Theory,45,10
4625,Leonard,2, How?,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
4626,Sheldon,2," If we were, the food would be better.",2,Big Bang Theory,38,8
4628,Leonard,2," Hey, Leslie.",2,Big Bang Theory,13,2
4630,Sheldon,2," Hello to you, insufficiently intelligent person.",2,Big Bang Theory,49,6
4632,Leonard,2," Uh, sure.",2,Big Bang Theory,10,2
4633,Sheldon,2," Well, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go do work that promises significant results, as opposed to what you do, which does not. Yeah, you heard me.",2,Big Bang Theory,149,28
4635,Leonard,2, Where did you hear that?,2,Big Bang Theory,25,5
4637,Leonard,2, Like blue ice falling out of an airplane lavatory. Yep.,2,Big Bang Theory,56,10
4639,Leonard,2, Are you suggesting another bout of stress release.,2,Big Bang Theory,51,8
4641,Leonard,2," Really, what changed?",2,Big Bang Theory,22,3
4643,Leonard,2," Yeah, I can see how that would a bunch of people?",2,Big Bang Theory,50,11
4645,Leonard,2," Oh, I'm flattered. So, how do you suggest we proceed?",2,Big Bang Theory,54,10
4647,Leonard,2, Sounds fun.,2,Big Bang Theory,12,2
4649,Leonard,2," Thank you, that's very thoughtful.",2,Big Bang Theory,35,5
4652,Sheldon,2, Great news. My mom sent me my old Nintendo 64.,2,Big Bang Theory,47,10
4653,Leonard,2, Terrific.,2,Big Bang Theory,10,1
4654,Sheldon,2," You know what this means, don't you? Break out the Red Bull, it's time to rock Mario old school.",2,Big Bang Theory,97,19
4655,Leonard,2, I kind of have other plans tonight.,2,Big Bang Theory,36,7
4656,Sheldon,2," But it's Friday. Friday's always vintage game night. Look, mom included the memory card, we can pick up where I left off in 1999 when I had pernicious anaemia.",2,Big Bang Theory,160,29
4657,Leonard,2," Well, the thing is, someone's coming over.",2,Big Bang Theory,43,7
4658,Sheldon,2," Well then, no problem, I have three controllers, the more the merrier.",2,Big Bang Theory,71,12
4659,Leonard,2," Sheldon, it's a date, I have a date coming over.",2,Big Bang Theory,49,10
4660,Sheldon,2," Oh, well you can't blame me for not jumping to that conclusion.",2,Big Bang Theory,64,12
4661,Leonard,2," Why, what's so unusual about me having a date?",2,Big Bang Theory,47,9
4662,Sheldon,2," Well, statistically speaking",2,Big Bang Theory,29,3
4663,Leonard,2," Alright, alright. Well, uh, nevertheless, I have one now and I would appreciate it if you would, you know, make yourself scarce.",2,Big Bang Theory,129,22
4664,Sheldon,2," Leonard, I am a published theoretical physicist with two doctorates and an IQ which can't be accurately measured by normal tests, how much scarcer could I be?",2,Big Bang Theory,159,27
4665,Leonard,2," You know what I mean, could you just give us a little privacy?",2,Big Bang Theory,63,13
4666,Sheldon,2, You want me to leave the apartment?,2,Big Bang Theory,36,7
4667,Leonard,2, Yes.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
4668,Sheldon,2, You mean just go someplace else and be someplace else?,2,Big Bang Theory,55,10
4669,Leonard,2, Yes.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
4670,Sheldon,2," Well, why should I leave, this is my apartment too.",2,Big Bang Theory,52,10
4671,Leonard,2," I know it is, and if science ever discovers a second member of your species and you two would like some privacy I would be more than happy to get out of your way.",2,Big Bang Theory,163,34
4672,Sheldon,2, Well alright then.,2,Big Bang Theory,19,3
4674,Penny,2, Sheldon? What are you doing?,2,Big Bang Theory,29,5
4675,Sheldon,2, Playing Super Mario on a poorly coded Nintendo 64 emulator.,2,Big Bang Theory,60,10
4676,Penny,2," Yeah, but why are you doing it on the stairs?",2,Big Bang Theory,46,10
4677,Sheldon,2," I'm a modern day Napoleon exiled to the Elba of the staircase because Leonard, get this, has a date.",2,Big Bang Theory,101,19
4678,Penny,2," Oh. Oh, well, good for him. Yeah but, why are you sitting here, why don't you just go to a movie or something?",2,Big Bang Theory,111,23
4679,Sheldon,2, Alone?,2,Big Bang Theory,7,1
4680,Penny,2," Yeah, why not?",2,Big Bang Theory,15,3
4681,Sheldon,2," What if I choke on my popcorn, who will administer the Heimlich manoeuvre.",2,Big Bang Theory,75,13
4682,Penny,2, Well then don't order popcorn.,2,Big Bang Theory,31,5
4683,Sheldon,2, No popcorn at the mo listen to yourself.,2,Big Bang Theory,41,8
4684,Penny,2, Well why don't you go to a coffee shop.,2,Big Bang Theory,40,9
4685,Sheldon,2, I don't drink coffee.,2,Big Bang Theory,22,4
4686,Penny,2, They have other things.,2,Big Bang Theory,24,4
4687,Sheldon,2, What do they have?,2,Big Bang Theory,19,4
4688,Penny,2," I don't know, you know, cookies, pastries",2,Big Bang Theory,42,7
4689,Sheldon,2, Pastries such as bearclaws?,2,Big Bang Theory,28,4
4690,Penny,2," Yeah, sure.",2,Big Bang Theory,12,2
4691,Sheldon,2, I don't like bearclaws.,2,Big Bang Theory,24,4
4693,Sheldon,2," Leslie Winkle. Of all the overrated physicists in all the labs in all the world, why does it have to be Leslie Winkle?",2,Big Bang Theory,119,23
4694,Penny,2," Well, they have a lot in common. I mean they're both scientists.",2,Big Bang Theory,65,12
4695,Sheldon,2, Oh please. The only way she could make a contribution to science would be if they resume sending chimps into space.,2,Big Bang Theory,116,21
4696,Penny,2," Okay, well I have a date too, so see ya.",2,Big Bang Theory,41,10
4697,Sheldon,2," Everybody has a date. Even you, Mario, going after Princess Peach. And what am I doing, I'm just enabling you.",2,Big Bang Theory,111,20
4700,Leonard,2," Yeah, it's from Changs.",2,Big Bang Theory,24,4
4702,Leonard,2," No, Changs.",2,Big Bang Theory,12,2
4704,Leonard,2, It changed.,2,Big Bang Theory,12,2
4706,Leonard,2, A little.,2,Big Bang Theory,10,2
4708,Leonard,2, I sure hope so.,2,Big Bang Theory,16,4
4710,Sheldon,2," I'm sorry to interrupt, batteries dying continue.",2,Big Bang Theory,50,7
4712,Sheldon,2, Don't forget the male pattern baldness. When his uncles sit around the dinner table they look like a half carton of eggs. ,2,Big Bang Theory,123,22
4713,Leonard,2," Okay, now my uncles are bald, but my Aunt Edna is one of the hairiest women you will ever meet. So Sweet lady. It always tickles when she hugs me.  What now?",2,Big Bang Theory,158,32
4714,Sheldon,2, I have to make pee-pee.,2,Big Bang Theory,24,5
4715,Leonard,2," Listen, I'm sorry about all of Sheldon's interruptions, he can be a bit of an eccentric.",2,Big Bang Theory,89,16
4717,Leonard,2," Well, I think tonight was a very good start.",2,Big Bang Theory,45,9
4719,Leonard,2," No problem, I'm very skilled at postponing intercourse. So I guess I'll call you and we'll arrange another evening.",2,Big Bang Theory,116,19
4721,Leonard,2, Sure.,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
4723,Penny,2," No, it wasn't my cat, it was an experiment designed by this guy named Schrodinger.",2,Big Bang Theory,83,15
4725,Penny,2," No, he was some kind of scientist, let me start again. Oh, hey Leonard.",2,Big Bang Theory,72,14
4726,Leonard,2, Hello.,2,Big Bang Theory,7,1
4727,Penny,2, Leslie.,2,Big Bang Theory,8,1
4729,Leonard,2," Okay, well, goodnight. ",2,Big Bang Theory,24,3
4730,Penny,2," Okay, well, goodnight.  ",2,Big Bang Theory,25,3
4732,Leonard,2, Right ,2,Big Bang Theory,7,1
4733,Penny,2," Okay, goodnight.",2,Big Bang Theory,17,2
4735,Penny,2," Had a great time, ciao ",2,Big Bang Theory,24,5
4737,Sheldon,2," I'm sorry, I am not going back to the Renaissance Fair.",2,Big Bang Theory,56,11
4738,Howard,2," Come on, Sheldon, there's so few places I can wear my jester costume.",2,Big Bang Theory,70,13
4739,Sheldon,2, I don't care. There are far too many historical anomalies for my comfort.,2,Big Bang Theory,74,13
4740,Raj,2," Oh, okay, how about this. You can go dressed as a Star Trek science officer exploring a planet similar to Earth in the 1500s.",2,Big Bang Theory,126,24
4741,Sheldon,2, You mean like Spock?,2,Big Bang Theory,21,4
4742,Raj,2, Sure.,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
4743,Sheldon,2, Fascinating.,2,Big Bang Theory,13,1
4745,Leonard,2," Hey, why don't we all move over there so Leslie can join us.",2,Big Bang Theory,61,13
4746,Howard,2," Hmm, let's do it. ",2,Big Bang Theory,19,4
4747,Sheldon,2," If you're having trouble deciding where to sit may I suggest one potato two potato, or as I call it the Leslie Winkle experimental methodology.",2,Big Bang Theory,144,25
4748,Leonard,2, Don't make this hard for me.,2,Big Bang Theory,29,6
4749,Sheldon,2," It's not hard. It's simple. You can either sit with me, your friend, colleague and roommate, or you can sit with an overrated scientist you might have sex with.",2,Big Bang Theory,161,29
4750,Leonard,2," You're right, it is simple. ",2,Big Bang Theory,29,5
4752,Penny,2," Hey, Sheldon.",2,Big Bang Theory,14,2
4753,Sheldon,2, Penny.,2,Big Bang Theory,7,1
4754,Penny,2," Third floor tonight. Mixing it up?  Oh. You know, I still don't understand why you just don't go to dinner or something.",2,Big Bang Theory,121,22
4755,Sheldon,2," Alright, let's say I go to dinner alone. And during the meal I have to use the rest room. How do I know someone's not touching my food?",2,Big Bang Theory,136,28
4756,Penny,2, Goodnight Sheldon.,2,Big Bang Theory,19,2
4757,Sheldon,2," Penny, hold on. Are you sure things can't work out with you and Leonard?",2,Big Bang Theory,73,14
4758,Penny,2, Excuse me?,2,Big Bang Theory,11,2
4759,Sheldon,2, I'm just wondering if you really gave it the old college try? Or in your case the old community college try?,2,Big Bang Theory,109,21
4760,Penny,2," Okay, where is this coming from?",2,Big Bang Theory,33,6
4761,Sheldon,2, Leonard is upstairs right now with my arch enemy.,2,Big Bang Theory,50,9
4762,Penny,2, Your arch enemy?,2,Big Bang Theory,17,3
4763,Sheldon,2," Yes, the Doctor Doom to my Mr Fantastic. The Doctor Octopus to my Spiderman. The Doctor Sivana to my Captain Marvel.",2,Big Bang Theory,117,21
4764,Penny,2," Okay, I get it, I get it, I get it.",2,Big Bang Theory,36,10
4765,Sheldon,2," Do you know, it's amazing how many supervillains have advanced degrees. Graduate school should probably do a better job of screening those people out.",2,Big Bang Theory,151,24
4766,Penny,2," Sheldon, come back, you're losing me.",2,Big Bang Theory,38,6
4767,Sheldon,2," Leslie Winkle, Penny. She belittles my research.",2,Big Bang Theory,49,7
4768,Penny,2," Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.",2,Big Bang Theory,24,4
4769,Sheldon,2, She called me dumbass.,2,Big Bang Theory,23,4
4770,Penny,2, I know. I heard.,2,Big Bang Theory,17,4
4771,Sheldon,2," Given this situation, I have no choice but to withdraw my previous objections to your ill considered relationship with Leonard.",2,Big Bang Theory,128,20
4772,Penny,2," Oh, gee, well, thankyou for that. But, um, I think for now Leonard and I are just going to stay friends.",2,Big Bang Theory,105,21
4773,Sheldon,2," No, that response is unacceptable to me.",2,Big Bang Theory,41,7
4774,Penny,2," Sheldon, you are a smart guy, you must know",2,Big Bang Theory,44,9
4775,Sheldon,2, Smart? I'd have to lose 60 IQ points to be classified as smart.,2,Big Bang Theory,64,13
4776,Penny,2, Are you going to let me talk?,2,Big Bang Theory,30,7
4777,Sheldon,2, I'm sorry.,2,Big Bang Theory,11,2
4778,Penny,2," You must know that if Leonard and Leslie want to be together, nothing you can do is going to stop it.",2,Big Bang Theory,102,21
4779,Sheldon,2, You continue to underestimate my abilities madam.,2,Big Bang Theory,50,7
4780,Penny,2," Okay, let me put it this way, if you're really Leonard's friend you will support him no matter who he wants to be with.",2,Big Bang Theory,120,24
4781,Sheldon,2," Wait a minute, why am I doing all the giving here? If Leonard's really my friend, why doesn't he have to support me in my hatred of Leslie Winkle?",2,Big Bang Theory,147,29
4782,Penny,2, Because love trumps hate.,2,Big Bang Theory,26,4
4783,Sheldon,2, Oh now you're just making stuff up.,2,Big Bang Theory,36,7
4784,Penny,2, Okay. Goodnight Sheldon.,2,Big Bang Theory,25,3
4785,Sheldon,2," Oh Mario. If only I could control everyone the way I control you. Hop, you little plumber, hop, hop, hop.",2,Big Bang Theory,106,20
4787,Sheldon,2, When the two of you reach a natural stopping point I'd like to have a word.,2,Big Bang Theory,76,16
4788,Leonard,2," If the word is pee-pee, just do it.",2,Big Bang Theory,36,8
4789,Sheldon,2," Leonard, you are my friend. And friends support their friends, apparently. So I am withdrawing my objection to your desire to have a relationship with Leslie.",2,Big Bang Theory,159,26
4790,Leonard,2, Thank you.,2,Big Bang Theory,11,2
4791,Sheldon,2," I will graciously overlook the fact that she is an arrogant sub-par scientist, who actually believes loop quantum gravity better unites quantum mechanics with general relativity than does string theory. You kids have fun.",2,Big Bang Theory,222,34
4793,Sheldon,2," I'm listening, amuse me.",2,Big Bang Theory,25,4
4795,Sheldon,2, Balderdash. Matter clearly consists of tiny strings.,2,Big Bang Theory,53,7
4797,Leonard,2," Okay, well, there is a lot of merit to both theories.",2,Big Bang Theory,54,11
4799,Leonard,2," Sheldon, don't make that noise, it's disrespectful.",2,Big Bang Theory,52,7
4800,Sheldon,2," I hope so, it was a snort of derision.",2,Big Bang Theory,39,9
4802,Leonard,2," Sorry Leslie, I guess I prefer my space stringy not loopy.",2,Big Bang Theory,59,11
4804,Leonard,2," Truth, what truth? We're talking about untested hypotheses, uh, it's no big deal.",2,Big Bang Theory,82,13
4806,Leonard,2, I guess we let them wait until they're old enough and let them choose their own theory.,2,Big Bang Theory,88,17
4808,Leonard,2," Wait, where are you going?",2,Big Bang Theory,27,5
4810,Sheldon,2, Look on the bright side.,2,Big Bang Theory,25,5
4811,Leonard,2, What's the bright side?,2,Big Bang Theory,24,4
4812,Sheldon,2, Only nine more months to comic-con.,2,Big Bang Theory,36,6
4813,Leonard,2, Oh yeah.,2,Big Bang Theory,9,2
4815,Sheldon,2," Captain, I'm getting an unusual reading.",2,Big Bang Theory,41,6
4816,Leonard,2," Yeah, that's great, you guys want corn dogs?",2,Big Bang Theory,45,8
4817,Howard,2, Yeah.,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
4818,Sheldon,2, That's a temporal anomaly. Corn dogs didn't come into existence until the first half of the twentieth century.,2,Big Bang Theory,111,18
4820,Sheldon,3," Fellow warriors, this is Sheldor the Conqueror. We are about to enter Axel's fortress. Now this is a long run, so let's do another bladder check. Alright Barry, we'll wait for you again, but you really should see a doctor.  Sheldor is AFK.  Penny, are you experiencing some sort of difficulty?",2,Big Bang Theory,294,51
4821,Penny,3," Yes, I can't get my stupid door open.",2,Big Bang Theory,38,8
4822,Sheldon,3," You appear to have put your car key in the door lock, are you aware of that?",2,Big Bang Theory,77,17
4823,Penny,3, Yeah!,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
4824,Sheldon,3, Alright then.  ,2,Big Bang Theory,16,2
4825,Penny,3," Dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit.",2,Big Bang Theory,48,6
4826,Sheldon,3, Would it be possible for you to do this a little more quietly?,2,Big Bang Theory,63,13
4827,Penny,3, I can't get the damned key out.,2,Big Bang Theory,32,7
4828,Sheldon,3," Well that's not surprising. That Baldwin lock on your door uses traditional edge mounted cylinders, whereas the key for your Volkswagon uses a centre cylinder system.",2,Big Bang Theory,167,26
4829,Penny,3," Thankyou, Sheldon.",2,Big Bang Theory,19,2
4830,Sheldon,3," You're welcome. Point of inquiry, why did you put your car key in the door lock?",2,Big Bang Theory,81,16
4831,Penny,3," Why? I'll tell you why. Because today I had an audition, it took me two hours to get there, I waited an hour for my turn, and before I could even start they told me I looked too Midwest for the part. Too Midwest? What the hell does that even mean?",2,Big Bang Theory,248,51
4832,Sheldon,3," Well, the American Midwest was mostly settled by Scandinavian and Germanic peoples who, well they have a characteristic facial bone structure.",2,Big Bang Theory,143,21
4833,Penny,3," I know what it means, Sheldon! God, you know, I have been in L.A. for almost two years now, and I haven't got a single acting job, I have accomplished nothing, haven't gotten a raise at work, haven't even had sex in six months, and just now when I was walking up those stairs a fly flew in my mouth and I ate it.",2,Big Bang Theory,313,64
4834,Sheldon,3," Well, actually, insects are a dietary staple in many cultures, they're almost pure protein.",2,Big Bang Theory,92,14
4835,Penny,3," Oh, sonofabitch!",2,Big Bang Theory,17,2
4836,Sheldon,3," I believe the condensation on your frozen foods weakened the structural integrity of the bag. But returning to your key conundrum, perhaps you should call a locksmith and have him open the door for you.",2,Big Bang Theory,203,35
4837,Penny,3," I did, and he said he'll get here when he gets here.",2,Big Bang Theory,53,12
4838,Sheldon,3, And you're frustrated because he phrased his reply in the form of a meaningless tautology?,2,Big Bang Theory,91,15
4839,Penny,3, No! I am frustrated because I am a failure at everything and my breath smells like fly. ,2,Big Bang Theory,89,17
4840,Sheldon,3, There there.  Would you prefer to wait in our apartment?,2,Big Bang Theory,57,10
4841,Penny,3," No Sheldon, I'd rather sit on this freezing cold floor sobbing like a three year-old.",2,Big Bang Theory,86,15
4842,Sheldon,3, Alright then.  ,2,Big Bang Theory,16,2
4843,Penny,3, For God's sake! ,2,Big Bang Theory,17,3
4844,Sheldon,3, Just when I think I've gotten the hang of sarcasm.,2,Big Bang Theory,51,10
4846,Sheldon,3, Make yourself comfortable.  Not there.  Sheldor is back online.,2,Big Bang Theory,64,9
4847,Penny,3, Sheldor?,2,Big Bang Theory,9,1
4848,Sheldon,3, The Conqueror.,2,Big Bang Theory,15,2
4849,Penny,3, What are you doing?,2,Big Bang Theory,20,4
4850,Sheldon,3," AFK. I'm playing Age of Conan, an online multiplayer game set in the universe of Robert E. Howard's Conan the Barbarian.",2,Big Bang Theory,121,21
4851,Penny,3, Oh.,2,Big Bang Theory,4,1
4852,Sheldon,3," Sheldor, back online.",2,Big Bang Theory,22,3
4853,Penny,3, What's AFK?,2,Big Bang Theory,12,2
4854,Sheldon,3, AFK. Away from keyboard.,2,Big Bang Theory,25,4
4855,Penny,3, OIC.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
4856,Sheldon,3, What does that stand for?,2,Big Bang Theory,26,5
4857,Penny,3," Oh, I see?",2,Big Bang Theory,11,3
4858,Sheldon,3," Yes, but what does it stand for?",2,Big Bang Theory,33,7
4860,Sheldon,3, Now just click on the enchanted boots to put them on.,2,Big Bang Theory,54,11
4861,Penny,3," Oh, I don't know. Can I see them in another colour?",2,Big Bang Theory,52,11
4862,Sheldon,3," Just click on them. Congratulations, you are now a level three warrior.",2,Big Bang Theory,72,12
4863,Leonard,3, What's going on?,2,Big Bang Theory,17,3
4864,Penny,3," Leonard, guess what, I'm a level three warrior.",2,Big Bang Theory,48,8
4865,Leonard,3," Great, you know there are groceries outside of your apartment?",2,Big Bang Theory,63,10
4866,Penny,3," Yeah yeah yeah, shhh!",2,Big Bang Theory,22,4
4867,Leonard,3, I only bring it up because your ice-cream is melting and it's starting to attract wildlife.,2,Big Bang Theory,92,16
4868,Penny,3," Uh-huh, yeah, do I stay in the jungle or go towards the beach?",2,Big Bang Theory,63,13
4869,Sheldon,3," It doesn't matter, right now you're looking for treasure.",2,Big Bang Theory,58,9
4870,Penny,3," Okay.  Wait, wait, where are you going?",2,Big Bang Theory,40,7
4871,Sheldon,3," You're okay, if you run into crocodiles just kick them with your boots.",2,Big Bang Theory,72,13
4872,Leonard,3, Want to catch me up?,2,Big Bang Theory,21,5
4873,Sheldon,3," Well let's see, uh, she attempted to open her apartment with her car key, because her face is overly Midwestern, um, she hasn't had sex in six months, and she ate a fly.",2,Big Bang Theory,170,33
4874,Leonard,3," Uh-huh. Seriously, six months?",2,Big Bang Theory,31,4
4875,Penny,3," Oh my God, a treasure chest, I'm rich!",2,Big Bang Theory,39,8
4876,Sheldon,3, Level three and she thinks she's rich! What a noob.,2,Big Bang Theory,52,10
4878,Raj,3," Okay, we're all set.",2,Big Bang Theory,21,4
4879,Howard,3, Let her rip.,2,Big Bang Theory,13,3
4880,Penny,3, Hi!,2,Big Bang Theory,4,1
4881,Leonard,3," Hey, check it out, it's just corn starch and water.",2,Big Bang Theory,52,10
4882,Sheldon,3," They make up a non-Newtonian fluid which is liquid, but solid under the percussive action of the speaker.",2,Big Bang Theory,106,18
4883,Howard,3, That's what makes it get all funky.,2,Big Bang Theory,36,7
4884,Penny,3," Yeah, okay. Listen, I need to talk to Sheldon.",2,Big Bang Theory,47,9
4885,Howard,3," No, that's what she said, Sheldon.",2,Big Bang Theory,35,6
4886,Penny,3," Okay, look, I bought the game, and I've been exploring the Island of Tordage but I can't figure out how to get past the guard captain.",2,Big Bang Theory,135,26
4887,Sheldon,3, Do you have the enchanted sword?,2,Big Bang Theory,33,6
4888,Penny,3," No, no, I've a bronze dagger.",2,Big Bang Theory,30,6
4889,Sheldon,3," You can't slay the guard captain with a bronze dagger, my Lord it's like the car key in your apartment door all over again.",2,Big Bang Theory,124,24
4890,Penny,3," Alright, alright, how do I get the sword?",2,Big Bang Theory,42,8
4891,Sheldon,3," Well, have you been to the Temple of Mithra?",2,Big Bang Theory,45,9
4892,Penny,3, Is that the place on the hill with the weird priests in front of it?,2,Big Bang Theory,69,15
4893,Sheldon,3," No, no, no, it's oh for God's sakes, gimme. ",2,Big Bang Theory,45,9
4894,Penny,3," Thank you, I really appreciate this.",2,Big Bang Theory,37,6
4895,Sheldon,3," You're going to have to learn to do these things for yourself, Penny.",2,Big Bang Theory,70,13
4896,Penny,3," Don't patronise me, just get the sword.",2,Big Bang Theory,40,7
4897,Howard,3, What the frak?,2,Big Bang Theory,15,3
4898,Leonard,3, Beats me. They were playing all last night too.,2,Big Bang Theory,48,9
4899,Raj,3, It's like some kind of weird comic book crossover.,2,Big Bang Theory,51,9
4900,Howard,3, Like if Hulk were dating Peppermint Patty.,2,Big Bang Theory,43,7
4901,Raj,3, I always thought Peppermint Patty was a lesbian?,2,Big Bang Theory,49,8
4902,Leonard,3," No, that's Marcie. Peppermint Patty's just athletic.",2,Big Bang Theory,53,7
4903,Sheldon,3," There you go, one enchanted sword.",2,Big Bang Theory,35,6
4904,Penny,3," Right, gimme, gimme, gimme, I want to kill the guard captain. .",2,Big Bang Theory,64,12
4905,Sheldon,3, That girl needs to get a life.,2,Big Bang Theory,31,7
4907,Penny,3, Sheldon.  Shel-don.,2,Big Bang Theory,20,2
4908,Sheldon,3," Danger, danger.",2,Big Bang Theory,16,2
4909,Penny,3," No danger, look, it's just me, Penny, look, I got to level 25 and reached Purple Lotus Swamp, right?",2,Big Bang Theory,101,19
4910,Sheldon,3, You're in my bedroom.,2,Big Bang Theory,22,4
4911,Penny,3, Yeah. Leonard gave me an emergency key.,2,Big Bang Theory,40,7
4912,Sheldon,3, People can't be in my bedroom.,2,Big Bang Theory,31,6
4913,Penny,3," Okay, well can we go talk in the living room?",2,Big Bang Theory,46,10
4914,Sheldon,3, I'm not wearing pyjama bottoms.,2,Big Bang Theory,32,5
4915,Penny,3, Why not?,2,Big Bang Theory,9,2
4916,Sheldon,3, I spilled grape juice.,2,Big Bang Theory,23,4
4917,Penny,3," Well, wear different pyjamas.",2,Big Bang Theory,30,4
4918,Sheldon,3," I can't wear different pyjamas, these are my Monday pyjamas. Penny, people cannot be in my bedroom.",2,Big Bang Theory,100,17
4919,Penny,3," Okay, just tell me, is it too soon to join a quest to the Black Castle?",2,Big Bang Theory,72,16
4920,Sheldon,3, You were invited on a quest to the Black Castle?,2,Big Bang Theory,49,10
4921,Penny,3," Yeah, yeah, by some guys in Budapest, I'm just not sure it's the right move for my character.",2,Big Bang Theory,94,18
4922,Sheldon,3," Of course it's not, you're only a level 25, the Hungarians are just using you for dragon fodder.",2,Big Bang Theory,97,18
4923,Penny,3," Really? Boy, you'd think you could trust a horde of Hungarian barbarians.",2,Big Bang Theory,74,12
4924,Sheldon,3," Please Penny, enough, I have to sleep.",2,Big Bang Theory,39,7
4925,Penny,3," Okay, well you were great, thanks.  Oh, hey Leonard, listen, don't got in Sheldon's room, he's not wearing bottoms.",2,Big Bang Theory,116,19
4926,Leonard,3," Sheldon, you want to catch me up again?",2,Big Bang Theory,40,8
4929,Sheldon,3," I realise that Dr Gablehauser but it is your job, as head of the department, to mediate all inter-departmental disputes. University policy manual chapter four, subsection two, mediation of inter-departmental disputes.",2,Big Bang Theory,218,31
4933,Sheldon,3, No she doesn't.,2,Big Bang Theory,16,3
4935,Sheldon,3," Here's the problem. I was clearly signed up to use the mainframe in Buckman 204, and Dr Winkle just wantonly ripped the sign-up sheet off the wall.",2,Big Bang Theory,148,27
4937,Sheldon,3," If it is a crime to ensure that the universities resources are not being squandered chasing sub-atomic wild geese then I plead guilty.  Oh, Penny!",2,Big Bang Theory,147,25
4939,Sheldon,3," God, no.",2,Big Bang Theory,9,2
4941,Sheldon,3," Oh yeah, well, you wouldn't even be nominated. Dr Gablehauser, I have a series of important multi-bit calculations and simulations to run. All she's doing is reducing irrelevant data and making a mock",2,Big Bang Theory,201,33
4943,Sheldon,3," Hello. Penny, this is not a good time. No, I told you, you're not prepared for the Sanctum of Burning Souls. You need to be in a group of at least five for that quest, and one should be a level 35 healer. Penny, I can't log on and help you. We'll talk when I get home.  I'm not getting the computing time, am I?",2,Big Bang Theory,312,65
4946,Sheldon,3," Leonard, you have to do something about Penny. She is interfering with my sleep, she's interfering with my work, and if I had another significant aspect of my life, I'm sure she'd be interfering with that too.",2,Big Bang Theory,210,37
4947,Leonard,3," Why should I do something, you're the one who introduced her to online gaming.",2,Big Bang Theory,79,14
4948,Sheldon,3," Well, yes, but you're the one who said hello to her when she moved in. If you'd simply restrained yourself none of this would be happening.",2,Big Bang Theory,140,26
4949,Leonard,3, Why don't you just tell her to leave you alone.,2,Big Bang Theory,48,10
4950,Sheldon,3," I did. I told her, I texted her, I sent out a very emphatic twitter. I even changed my facebook status to Sheldon Cooper wishes Penny would leave him alone. I don't know what else to do.",2,Big Bang Theory,187,37
4951,Leonard,3," Well, what am I supposed to do?",2,Big Bang Theory,32,7
4952,Sheldon,3," I don't know, but if you don't figure something out, I warn you I shall become very difficult to live with.",2,Big Bang Theory,108,21
4953,Leonard,3," You mean, up until now we've been experiencing the happy funtime Sheldon?",2,Big Bang Theory,74,12
4954,Sheldon,3, Yes.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
4955,Leonard,3, I'll go talk to her.,2,Big Bang Theory,21,5
4957,Penny,3," No, Fritz, I need you on my flank. No, I don't know German. Flankenzie, flankenzie!",2,Big Bang Theory,84,15
4958,Leonard,3, Hey Penny.,2,Big Bang Theory,11,2
4959,Penny,3, Busy.,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
4960,Leonard,3," Yeah, I see that. Shouldn't you be at work?",2,Big Bang Theory,44,9
4961,Penny,3, I don't work on Mondays.,2,Big Bang Theory,25,5
4962,Leonard,3," It's Thursday. Listen, Penny.",2,Big Bang Theory,30,4
4963,Penny,3," Uh, Queen Penelope AFK. What?",2,Big Bang Theory,30,5
4964,Leonard,3," Okay, um, here's the thing, um, sometimes people, good people, you know, they start playing these games and they find themselves through no fault of their own, you know, kind of, addicted.",2,Big Bang Theory,189,32
4965,Penny,3," Yeah, get to the point, I'm about to level up here.",2,Big Bang Theory,52,11
4966,Leonard,3," Well, i-i-i-it's just if a person doesn't have a sense of achievement in their real life it's easy to lose themselves in a virtual world where they get a false sense of accomplishment.",2,Big Bang Theory,185,33
4967,Penny,3," Yeah, jabber jabber jabber, okay boys, Queen Penelope's back online.",2,Big Bang Theory,69,10
4968,Leonard,3," Penny, you've got cheetos in your hair.",2,Big Bang Theory,40,7
4969,Penny,3," Oh, thanks. ",2,Big Bang Theory,13,2
4970,Leonard,3, Wow.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
4978,Raj,3, Hey guys.,2,Big Bang Theory,10,2
4980,Raj,3," Hey, what's with him?",2,Big Bang Theory,22,4
4981,Leonard,3, Penny's been keeping him up at night.,2,Big Bang Theory,38,7
4982,Howard,3, Me too. But probably in a different way.,2,Big Bang Theory,41,8
4983,Leonard,3," She's gotten really hooked on Age of Conan, she's playing non-stop.",2,Big Bang Theory,68,11
4984,Raj,3," Ah, yes, online gaming addiction. There's nothing worse than having that multi-player monkey on your back.",2,Big Bang Theory,107,16
4985,Leonard,3," Sheldon, wake up.",2,Big Bang Theory,18,3
4986,Sheldon,3," Danger, danger.",2,Big Bang Theory,16,2
4988,Sheldon,3," Oh yeah, well your attempt at juvenilizing me by excluding me from the set of adult males. oh, I'm too tired to do this.",2,Big Bang Theory,121,24
4990,Sheldon,3, She comes into my room. No-one's supposed to be in my room.,2,Big Bang Theory,60,12
4992,Howard,3, I do that too. But probably in a different way.,2,Big Bang Theory,48,10
4993,Leonard,3," That's not what she's doing, Leslie, she's just trying to shore up her self esteem, it has nothing to do with sex.",2,Big Bang Theory,115,22
4995,Howard,3," Mmmm, testify. ",2,Big Bang Theory,16,2
4997,Leonard,3," Leslie, you are way off base here.",2,Big Bang Theory,35,7
4998,Sheldon,3," Hang on, Leonard, while I have no respect for Leslie as a scientist, or a human being for that matter, we have to concede her undeniable expertise in the interrelated fields of promiscuity and general sluttiness.",2,Big Bang Theory,213,36
5000,Sheldon,3," Some what? Oh, yes, some sexual intercourse.",2,Big Bang Theory,45,7
5001,Howard,3, I'll take the bullet.,2,Big Bang Theory,22,4
5002,Leonard,3," Excuse me, this whole idea is insane.",2,Big Bang Theory,38,7
5003,Sheldon,3," Yeah, yeah, enough debate, I'm going to take action.  Excuse me, are you currently involved in a sexual relationship?",2,Big Bang Theory,118,19
5005,Sheldon,3, Would you like to be?,2,Big Bang Theory,22,5
5007,Leonard,3, Sheldon,2,Big Bang Theory,8,1
5008,Sheldon,3, Zip it pip it. Can I have your phone number?,2,Big Bang Theory,45,10
5010,Sheldon,3," There, problem solved.",2,Big Bang Theory,23,3
5013,Penny,3," Okay, I'm at the gate to the Treasury of the Ancients, I'm going in.",2,Big Bang Theory,69,14
5014,Sheldon,3, Stay close to the wall. Avoid the mummies.,2,Big Bang Theory,43,8
5015,Penny,3, Got it.,2,Big Bang Theory,8,2
5016,Sheldon,3," I must say, you're playing very well for a woman of 23?",2,Big Bang Theory,56,12
5017,Penny,3,22,2,Big Bang Theory,2,1
5018,Sheldon,3, Right. 22. ,2,Big Bang Theory,12,2
5019,Penny,3," Oh, here come the mummies, which spell do I use? The hateful strike, or the frenzy stance?",2,Big Bang Theory,91,17
5020,Sheldon,3, What happened to the rest of your group?,2,Big Bang Theory,41,8
5021,Penny,3," I dumped them, they're a bunch of wussies.",2,Big Bang Theory,43,8
5022,Sheldon,3, Frenzy stance.,2,Big Bang Theory,15,2
5023,Penny,3," Frenzy, frenzy, frenzy, frenzy, frenzy!",2,Big Bang Theory,40,5
5024,Sheldon,3," So listen, would you describe your ideal vacation as a wild adventure to unknown lands, or staying at home curled up with a good book?",2,Big Bang Theory,135,25
5025,Penny,3, What?,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
5026,Sheldon,3, These are market research questions. I'm filling out the online registration for your game.,2,Big Bang Theory,92,14
5027,Penny,3," Oh, okay, wild adventure. Oh, frenzy stance isn't working, die you undead mummy, die!",2,Big Bang Theory,86,14
5028,Sheldon,3, Drink a healing potion.,2,Big Bang Theory,24,4
5029,Penny,3, Thank you.,2,Big Bang Theory,11,2
5030,Sheldon,3," You're welcome. Anyhow, on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being always initiated by him, and 5 being always initiated by you, how do you prefer your sexual encounters to begin?",2,Big Bang Theory,172,33
5031,Penny,3, That's on the registration?,2,Big Bang Theory,28,4
5032,Sheldon,3," Oh yes, it's quite extensive. But if we complete it, we get a free expansion pack, 75 additional quests.",2,Big Bang Theory,105,19
5033,Penny,3," Ooh, awesome, okay, I totally like to initiate I'm a big old five.",2,Big Bang Theory,67,13
5034,Sheldon,3, Good to know. Big old five.,2,Big Bang Theory,28,6
5036,Leonard,3, Hello.,2,Big Bang Theory,7,1
5038,Sheldon,3," Leonard, this is Tom.",2,Big Bang Theory,22,4
5039,Leonard,3, Hi Tom. Sheldon? Didn't I explain to you about your little mistake in the cafeteria?,2,Big Bang Theory,85,15
5040,Sheldon,3," Yes, you were very clear, as was everyone else at the table. Tom, however, has been chosen by science as a suitable mate for Penny.",2,Big Bang Theory,132,25
5041,Leonard,3, Chosen by science?,2,Big Bang Theory,19,3
5042,Sheldon,3," Well, what passes for science on dating sites. They claim to use heuristic algorithms, but it may well be hokum.",2,Big Bang Theory,113,20
5043,Leonard,3, You got Penny to sign up for online dating?,2,Big Bang Theory,44,9
5044,Sheldon,3," No, of course not. No, I used trickery and deceit.",2,Big Bang Theory,51,10
5045,Leonard,3, This is bad.,2,Big Bang Theory,13,3
5046,Sheldon,3," Tom is a paramedic with the fire department, but he's going to med school at night, uh, he likes the outdoors, and, uh, strong women who initiate sex.",2,Big Bang Theory,151,28
5047,Leonard,3," Really, really bad.",2,Big Bang Theory,20,3
5048,Sheldon,3, I'm surprised you struck out with Penny. Apparently she's a big old five.,2,Big Bang Theory,74,13
5049,Penny,3," Sheldon, what do you want.",2,Big Bang Theory,27,5
5050,Sheldon,3," Oh, good, you got my note. Penny, I'd like you to meet Tom, uh, Penny, this is Tom, Tom, may I present Penny.",2,Big Bang Theory,110,23
5052,Penny,3," Yeah, Hi, listen, as long as I'm here, I'm on a quest with a bunch of noobs, they don't know what they're doing, we've got one assassin, three spellcasters and no tank.",2,Big Bang Theory,169,32
5053,Sheldon,3, Can we talk about this later.,2,Big Bang Theory,30,6
5054,Penny,3," No, no, no, no, I need you now.",2,Big Bang Theory,32,8
5055,Sheldon,3," But wouldn't you prefer to socialise with Tom, who is a sexually passive outdoorsman.",2,Big Bang Theory,86,14
5056,Penny,3," Whatever, I'll figure it out myself.",2,Big Bang Theory,37,6
5058,Leonard,3, They never do.,2,Big Bang Theory,15,3
5064,Penny,3," Oh my God, I need help.  ",2,Big Bang Theory,26,6
5066,Leonard,4," Let's see, Raj was the Kung Palo Chicken.",2,Big Bang Theory,42,8
5067,Penny,4, I'm the dumplings.,2,Big Bang Theory,19,3
5068,Howard,4," Yes, you are.",2,Big Bang Theory,14,3
5069,Penny,4," Creepy, Howard.",2,Big Bang Theory,16,2
5070,Howard,4, Creepy good or creepy bad?,2,Big Bang Theory,27,5
5071,Leonard,4, Who was the Shrimp with Lobster Sauce?,2,Big Bang Theory,39,7
5072,Howard,4," That would be me. Come to Poppa, you un-kosher delight.  I'm not necessarily talking to the food.",2,Big Bang Theory,98,17
5073,Penny,4, Sit over there.,2,Big Bang Theory,16,3
5074,Sheldon,4, Sit over there. Baby wipe?,2,Big Bang Theory,27,5
5075,Penny,4, What do you have.,2,Big Bang Theory,18,4
5077,Sheldon,4, I'll tell you why.,2,Big Bang Theory,19,4
5079,Sheldon,4, I had to sanitize my hands because the university replaced the paper towels in the rest rooms with hot air blowers.,2,Big Bang Theory,116,21
5080,Penny,4, I thought the blowers were more sanitary?,2,Big Bang Theory,42,7
5082,Sheldon,4, Hot air blowers are incubators and spewers of bacteria and pestilence. Frankly it would be more hygienic if they just had a plague infested gibbon sneeze my hands dry.,2,Big Bang Theory,168,29
5083,Raj,4," Hey guys, I just got the most amazing new  ew-ew-ew",2,Big Bang Theory,52,10
5084,Penny,4," Gosh, Raj, do you think you'll ever be able to talk in front of me without being drunk?  Okay, well, I'll just, um, go eat by myself.",2,Big Bang Theory,134,27
5085,Leonard,4," Penny, you don't have to do that.",2,Big Bang Theory,34,7
5086,Penny,4," No, it's okay, between  him not talking,  him talking and  him, I'm better off alone, so,  goodbye you poor strange little man  ",2,Big Bang Theory,129,22
5087,Raj,4, She's so considerate.,2,Big Bang Theory,22,3
5088,Howard,4, So what's your news?,2,Big Bang Theory,21,4
5089,Raj,4, Remember that little planetary object I spotted beyond the Kuiper belt?,2,Big Bang Theory,72,11
5090,Leonard,4," Oh yeah, two zero zero eight NQ sub seventeen.",2,Big Bang Theory,47,9
5091,Raj,4," Or as I called it, Planet Bollywood. Anyway, because of my discovery, People magazine is naming me one of their thirty under-30 to watch.",2,Big Bang Theory,138,24
5093,Sheldon,4," Excuse me. Thirty what, under thirty what, to watch what?",2,Big Bang Theory,58,10
5094,Raj,4, Thirty visionaries under thirty years of age to watch as they challenge the preconceptions of their fields.,2,Big Bang Theory,108,17
5095,Sheldon,4, If I had a million guesses I never would have gotten that.,2,Big Bang Theory,59,12
5096,Raj,4," It's pretty cool, they've got me in with a guy who's doing something about hunger in Indonesia, and a psychotherapist who's using dolphins to rehabilitate prisoners, and Ellen Page, star of the charming independent film Juno.",2,Big Bang Theory,226,36
5097,Howard,4," Oh, I'd so do her.",2,Big Bang Theory,19,5
5098,Leonard,4, You'd do the dolphins.,2,Big Bang Theory,23,4
5099,Howard,4, Do I get an honourable mention for designing the telescope camera mounting bracket you used.,2,Big Bang Theory,93,15
5100,Raj,4," Sorry, it's not part of my heartwarming and personal narrative, in which a humble boy from New Delhi overcame poverty and prejudice and journeyed to America to reach for the stars.",2,Big Bang Theory,181,31
5101,Howard,4," Poverty? Your father's a gynaecologist, he drives a Bentley.",2,Big Bang Theory,61,9
5102,Raj,4, It's a lease.,2,Big Bang Theory,14,3
5103,Sheldon,4, I'm confused. Was there some sort of peer review committee to determine which scientists would be included?,2,Big Bang Theory,108,17
5104,Raj,4, Peer review? It's People magazine. People picked me.,2,Big Bang Theory,53,8
5105,Sheldon,4, What people?,2,Big Bang Theory,13,2
5106,Raj,4, The people from People.,2,Big Bang Theory,24,4
5107,Sheldon,4," Yeah, but exactly who are these people? What are their credentials, how are they qualified, what makes accidentally noticing a hunk of rock that's been traipsing around the solar system for billions of years more noteworthy than any other scientific accomplishment made by someone under thirty?",2,Big Bang Theory,295,46
5108,Raj,4," Boy, I bet Ellen Pages friends aren't giving her this kind of crap.",2,Big Bang Theory,68,13
5109,Leonard,4, Are you proud of yourself?,2,Big Bang Theory,27,5
5110,Sheldon,4," In general, yes.",2,Big Bang Theory,17,3
5112,Sheldon,4," Oh, there's my missing neutrino. You were hiding from me as an unbalanced charge, weren't you, you little subatomic Dickens?",2,Big Bang Theory,125,20
5113,Leonard,4, Hi Sheldon.,2,Big Bang Theory,12,2
5114,Sheldon,4," Here, look, look, I found my missing neutrino.",2,Big Bang Theory,47,8
5115,Howard,4," Oh, good, we can take it off the milk cartons.",2,Big Bang Theory,47,10
5116,Leonard,4," Well, we're going to go apologise to Raj and invite him out to dinner.",2,Big Bang Theory,71,14
5117,Sheldon,4," Apologise, for what?",2,Big Bang Theory,21,3
5118,Leonard,4," Well, he came over last night with some pretty good news, and we weren't very supportive.",2,Big Bang Theory,90,16
5119,Sheldon,4, I sense you're trying to tell me something.,2,Big Bang Theory,44,8
5120,Howard,4, You were a colossal ass-hat.,2,Big Bang Theory,29,5
5121,Sheldon,4," Oh! No, I beg to differ. Of the three of us, I was by far the most supportive.",2,Big Bang Theory,79,18
5122,Leonard,4," Really, do tell.",2,Big Bang Theory,17,3
5123,Sheldon,4," How will Raj ever reach true greatness if his friends lower the bar for him? When I was eleven, my sister bought our father a â€œworld's greatest dadâ€ù coffee mug, and frankly the man coasted until the day he died.",2,Big Bang Theory,216,40
5124,Leonard,4," Okay, let's try it this way, what if the People magazine thing is the best Raj is ever going to achieve?",2,Big Bang Theory,105,21
5125,Sheldon,4, I had not considered that.,2,Big Bang Theory,27,5
5126,Leonard,4, Come on.,2,Big Bang Theory,9,2
5127,Sheldon,4, I often forget other people have limitations. It's so sad.,2,Big Bang Theory,59,10
5128,Howard,4, He can feel sadness?,2,Big Bang Theory,21,4
5129,Leonard,4," Not really, it's what you and I would call condescension.",2,Big Bang Theory,58,10
5131,Leonard,4," And when we go in there, let's show Raj that we're happy for him.",2,Big Bang Theory,66,14
5132,Sheldon,4, But I'm not.,2,Big Bang Theory,13,3
5133,Howard,4," Well then fake it. Look at me, I could be grinding on the fact that without my stabilizing telescope mount he never would have found that stupid little clump of cosmic schmutz, but I'm bigger than that.",2,Big Bang Theory,203,37
5134,Sheldon,4," Fine, what do you want me to do?",2,Big Bang Theory,33,8
5135,Leonard,4, Smile. ,2,Big Bang Theory,8,1
5136,Howard,4," Oh crap, that's terrifying.",2,Big Bang Theory,28,4
5137,Leonard,4," We're here to see Koothrappali, not kill Batman.",2,Big Bang Theory,49,8
5138,Howard,4, Try less teeth. ,2,Big Bang Theory,17,3
5139,Leonard,4," Close enough, come on.  Hi Raj.",2,Big Bang Theory,32,6
5140,Raj,4," Hey guys, what's up?",2,Big Bang Theory,21,4
5141,Howard,4, We just wanted to invite you out to dinner tonight.,2,Big Bang Theory,52,10
5142,Leonard,4, Celebrate your thirty under thirty thing. Right Sheldon?  ,2,Big Bang Theory,59,8
5143,Raj,4," It's very nice of you, I would like that.",2,Big Bang Theory,42,9
5145,Raj,4, Dr Gablehouser.,2,Big Bang Theory,16,2
5147,Leonard,4, Dr Gablehauser.,2,Big Bang Theory,16,2
5149,Sheldon,4, Dr Gablehauser.,2,Big Bang Theory,16,2
5151,Howard,4, Dr Gablehauser.,2,Big Bang Theory,16,2
5153,Raj,4," Actually, 2008 NQ sub 17 is a planetary body.",2,Big Bang Theory,46,9
5155,Sheldon,4," Well, you didn't discover him, you merely noticed he was here, much like he did with 2008 NQ sub 17.",2,Big Bang Theory,101,20
5156,Leonard,4, Sheldon!,2,Big Bang Theory,9,1
5157,Sheldon,4," Oh, sorry. ",2,Big Bang Theory,12,2
5159,Raj,4," Really, you don't have to go to any trouble.",2,Big Bang Theory,45,9
5161,Raj,4," I'd rather have Fishbine's, it's bigger.",2,Big Bang Theory,41,6
5163,Howard,4," Wait a minute, I called dibs on Fishbine's office the day he started showing up at work in his bathrobe.",2,Big Bang Theory,105,20
5164,Sheldon,4," He gets a new office, I can't even get paper towels in the men's room?",2,Big Bang Theory,71,15
5165,Leonard,4, Sheldon.,2,Big Bang Theory,9,1
5166,Sheldon,4," Damn, this is hard.  ",2,Big Bang Theory,22,4
5168,Leonard,4, Science?,2,Big Bang Theory,9,1
5170,Howard,4, Told you.,2,Big Bang Theory,10,2
5172,Howard,4, I have a master's degree.,2,Big Bang Theory,26,5
5174,Raj,4, I didn't even know there was a President's dining room.,2,Big Bang Theory,56,10
5176,Raj,4," Okay, big buddy. See you tonight guys. ",2,Big Bang Theory,40,7
5177,Leonard,4, You can stop smiling now.,2,Big Bang Theory,26,5
5178,Sheldon,4, Aaaah!,2,Big Bang Theory,7,1
5180,Raj,4," So anyway, after a fantastic lunch I was whisked off to the People magazine photo shoot have any of you boys ever been to a photo shoot?",2,Big Bang Theory,137,27
5181,Leonard,4, No.,2,Big Bang Theory,4,1
5182,Raj,4," It's fantastic, apparently the camera loves me and I it. They shot me in front of a starry background where I posed like this.  They're going to digitally add a supernova, they say it's the perfect metaphor for my incandescent talent.",2,Big Bang Theory,235,41
5183,Sheldon,4," Right, a ball of hot flaming gas that collapses in on itself.  ",2,Big Bang Theory,64,12
5184,Raj,4," Excuse me. Oh, it's my assistant Trevor. Go for Koothrappali. Uh-huh.",2,Big Bang Theory,70,11
5185,Howard,4, They gave him an assistant? If I want a new pen I have to go to the bank with wire cutters.,2,Big Bang Theory,92,21
5186,Sheldon,4, Have we at this point met our social obligations?,2,Big Bang Theory,50,9
5187,Leonard,4, Not yet.,2,Big Bang Theory,9,2
5188,Raj,4," Okay, just put it on my calendar but start thinking of a reason why I can't go, alrighty? Koothrappali out. God bless that boy, I don't know what I'd do without him.",2,Big Bang Theory,166,32
5189,Leonard,4, You just got him this afternoon.,2,Big Bang Theory,33,6
5190,Raj,4," Yes, but I'm finding that having a lackey suits me.",2,Big Bang Theory,52,10
5191,Leonard,4, A lackey?,2,Big Bang Theory,10,2
5192,Raj,4," Oh, I'm sorry, is that politically incorrect? In India we just call them untouchables.",2,Big Bang Theory,87,14
5193,Sheldon,4, Now?,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
5194,Leonard,4, Almost.,2,Big Bang Theory,8,1
5195,Raj,4," Speaking of untouchables, I've got great news for you guys. People magazine is having a reception this Saturday, and I managed to get you invited.",2,Big Bang Theory,147,25
5196,Howard,4," Oh, gee, thanks.",2,Big Bang Theory,17,3
5197,Raj,4," Oh, you're welcome. Of course, I couldn't get you into the VIP section, because, you know, that's for VIPs, and you guys are just, you know, Ps.",2,Big Bang Theory,145,27
5198,Sheldon,4," There's a tribe in Papua New Guinea where, when a hunter flaunts his success to the rest of the village they kill him, and drive away evil spirits with a drum made of his skin. Superstitious nonsense of course, but one can see their point. ",2,Big Bang Theory,241,45
5199,Penny,4," Here you go, Raj, you might want to drink this one slowly.",2,Big Bang Theory,59,12
5200,Raj,4," Okay, so, Saturday night, can I count on my posse?",2,Big Bang Theory,51,10
5201,Howard,4," Gee, I'd love to Raj, but I can't make it.",2,Big Bang Theory,43,10
5202,Raj,4," Oh, okay, Leonard?",2,Big Bang Theory,19,3
5203,Leonard,4," Well, uh, no I the no.",2,Big Bang Theory,23,6
5204,Raj,4, Sheldon?,2,Big Bang Theory,9,1
5205,Sheldon,4," I can make it, but I won't.",2,Big Bang Theory,28,7
5206,Penny,4, What are you guys talking about?,2,Big Bang Theory,33,6
5207,Raj,4," Well, there's a reception for my magazine article on Saturday.",2,Big Bang Theory,63,10
5208,Penny,4," And you guys aren't going? I can't believe you, Raj is celebrating a tremendous accomplishment and you're not even going to be there to support him?",2,Big Bang Theory,149,26
5209,Sheldon,4, A tremendous accomplishment would be if the planetary body he discovered were plummeting toward Earth and he exploded it with his mind.,2,Big Bang Theory,136,22
5210,Howard,4, That would be cool. I'd go to that reception.,2,Big Bang Theory,46,9
5211,Penny,4," Come on, this is huge, Raj is going to be in People magazine. And he didn't even have to knock up one of the Spears sisters.",2,Big Bang Theory,125,26
5212,Raj,4, Would you like to go with me?,2,Big Bang Theory,30,7
5213,Penny,4," Of course I would, I would be honoured.",2,Big Bang Theory,40,8
5214,Raj,4, Really? Cool.,2,Big Bang Theory,14,2
5215,Penny,4, Shame on you guys. ,2,Big Bang Theory,20,4
5216,Raj,4, Look at that. I got a date with Penny. I can't believe it took you a whole year.,2,Big Bang Theory,81,18
5217,Sheldon,4, Now?,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
5218,Leonard,4, Now. ,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
5219,Raj,4," Hey, buddy. I'm going to be in people magazine.",2,Big Bang Theory,48,9
5222,Penny,4," Oh, Raj, look at you!",2,Big Bang Theory,22,5
5223,Raj,4," I know, I am resplendent like the noonday sun, am I not?",2,Big Bang Theory,57,12
5224,Penny,4," Um, yeah, starting with the champagne a little early aren't you?",2,Big Bang Theory,65,11
5225,Raj,4," It was in the limo. They sent a limo. I have a limo. I just love saying limo. Here, sip on this while you're getting ready.",2,Big Bang Theory,124,26
5226,Penny,4," Oh, I'm ready.",2,Big Bang Theory,15,3
5227,Raj,4, That's what you're wearing.,2,Big Bang Theory,28,4
5228,Penny,4," Um, yeah, why what's wrong with it?",2,Big Bang Theory,36,7
5229,Raj,4," Nothing, I was just hoping for something a little more, you know, redonkulous.",2,Big Bang Theory,79,13
5230,Penny,4," Yeah, well, this is all the donkulous you're gonna get.",2,Big Bang Theory,56,10
5231,Raj,4," Okey dokey, let's roll. Alright, it's time to raise the roof. Oo-ooh, oo-ooh.",2,Big Bang Theory,78,13
5232,Penny,4, Hey Leonard.,2,Big Bang Theory,13,2
5233,Leonard,4, Hey.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
5234,Raj,4, Dude.,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
5235,Leonard,4, You look very nice.,2,Big Bang Theory,20,4
5237,Penny,4," Uh, come on, good night Leonard.",2,Big Bang Theory,33,6
5238,Leonard,4, Good night.,2,Big Bang Theory,12,2
5239,Raj,4," Hey, Leonard, did you see my limo downstairs.",2,Big Bang Theory,46,8
5240,Leonard,4, Yeah.,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
5241,Raj,4, It's bigger than the house my grandfather grew up in.,2,Big Bang Theory,54,10
5242,Leonard,4, Terrific.,2,Big Bang Theory,10,1
5243,Raj,4, It has more food too.,2,Big Bang Theory,22,5
5244,Penny,4," Alright, come on, come on.",2,Big Bang Theory,27,5
5245,Raj,4, I'm coming up so you better get this party started.,2,Big Bang Theory,52,10
5246,Leonard,4, Hey.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
5247,Howard,4," Hey, good news, you don't have to sulk about Penny any more, look, there are hundreds of Croatian women just waiting for you to contact them.",2,Big Bang Theory,142,26
5248,Leonard,4, Anythingforagreencard.com?,2,Big Bang Theory,27,1
5249,Howard,4," I'll lend you my user name, it's wealthybigpenis.",2,Big Bang Theory,50,8
5250,Leonard,4, You're joking.,2,Big Bang Theory,15,2
5251,Howard,4," Well, you gotta make it easy for them, they're just learning English.",2,Big Bang Theory,70,12
5252,Leonard,4, Pass.,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
5253,Howard,4, So you're just going to sit around here and mope while Penny is out with Doctor Apu from the Kwik-e-Mart?,2,Big Bang Theory,106,20
5254,Leonard,4," It's not a date, and that's racist.",2,Big Bang Theory,36,7
5255,Howard,4," It can't be racist, he's a beloved character on the Simpsons.",2,Big Bang Theory,62,11
5256,Leonard,4, Let's just eat so I can get to bed. With any luck tonight will be the night my sleep apnoea kills me.,2,Big Bang Theory,102,22
5257,Sheldon,4, Did you remember to ask for the chicken with broccoli to be diced not shredded?,2,Big Bang Theory,80,15
5258,Leonard,4, Yes.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
5259,Sheldon,4, Even though the menu description specifies shredded?,2,Big Bang Theory,53,7
5260,Leonard,4, Yes.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
5261,Sheldon,4," Brown rice, not white?",2,Big Bang Theory,23,4
5262,Leonard,4, Yes.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
5263,Sheldon,4, Did you stop at the Korean grocery and get the good hot mustard.,2,Big Bang Theory,65,13
5264,Leonard,4, Yes.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
5265,Sheldon,4, Did you pick up the low sodium soy sauce from the market?,2,Big Bang Theory,58,12
5266,Leonard,4, Yes.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
5267,Sheldon,4, Thank you.,2,Big Bang Theory,11,2
5268,Leonard,4, You're welcome.,2,Big Bang Theory,16,2
5269,Sheldon,4, What took you so long?,2,Big Bang Theory,23,5
5270,Leonard,4, Just sit down and eat.,2,Big Bang Theory,23,5
5271,Sheldon,4, Fine. ,2,Big Bang Theory,7,1
5272,Leonard,4," Alright, it's shredded, what do you want me to do?",2,Big Bang Theory,51,10
5273,Sheldon,4, I want you to check before you accept the order.,2,Big Bang Theory,49,10
5274,Leonard,4, Sorry.,2,Big Bang Theory,7,1
5275,Sheldon,4, Were you distracted by the possibility that Koothrappali might have intercourse with Penny tonight?,2,Big Bang Theory,100,14
5276,Leonard,4, He's not going to have intercourse with Penny.,2,Big Bang Theory,47,8
5277,Sheldon,4," Then there's no excuse for this chicken. You know, this situation with Koothrapali brings to mind a story from my childhood.",2,Big Bang Theory,125,21
5278,Howard,4," Oh goody, more tales from the panhandle.",2,Big Bang Theory,41,7
5279,Sheldon,4," That's Northwest Texas, I'm from East Texas, the Gulf region, home to many Vietnamese shrimpers.",2,Big Bang Theory,97,15
5280,Leonard,4, Do the shrimpers feature in your story?,2,Big Bang Theory,40,7
5281,Sheldon,4," No. Anyway, when I was eight, a Montgomery-Ward delivery van ran over our cat, Lucky.",2,Big Bang Theory,86,15
5282,Howard,4, Lucky?,2,Big Bang Theory,7,1
5283,Sheldon,4," Yes, Lucky.",2,Big Bang Theory,12,2
5284,Leonard,4," He's irony impaired, just move on.",2,Big Bang Theory,35,6
5285,Howard,4," Okay, dead cat named Lucky, continue.",2,Big Bang Theory,38,6
5286,Sheldon,4," While others mourned Lucky, I realised his untimely demise provided me with the opportunity to replace him with something more suited to my pet needs. A faithful companion that I could snuggle with at night, and yet would be capable of killing upon telepathic command.",2,Big Bang Theory,269,45
5287,Howard,4," So, not a puppy?",2,Big Bang Theory,17,4
5288,Sheldon,4," Please, no, nothing so pedestrian. I wanted a griffin.",2,Big Bang Theory,55,9
5289,Leonard,4, A griffin?,2,Big Bang Theory,11,2
5290,Sheldon,4," Yes, half eagle, half lion.",2,Big Bang Theory,28,5
5291,Leonard,4, And mythological.,2,Big Bang Theory,18,2
5292,Sheldon,4," Irrelevant. See, I was studying recombinant DNA technology and I was confident I could create one, but my parents were unwilling to secure the necessary eagle eggs and lion semen. Course my sister got swimming lessons when she wanted them.",2,Big Bang Theory,240,40
5293,Howard,4," Sheldon, not that we don't all enjoy a good lion semen story, what's your point.",2,Big Bang Theory,81,15
5294,Sheldon,4," My point is, if Koothrappali is moving on to a new life of shallow, undeserved fame, perhaps this is an opportunity to create a better cohort.",2,Big Bang Theory,143,26
5295,Leonard,4, You want to breed a new friend?,2,Big Bang Theory,32,7
5296,Sheldon,4," That's one option, but who has the time? But consider this, the Japanese, they're doing some wonderful work with artificial intelligence, now, you combine that with some animatronics from the imagineers over at Disney, next thing you know, we're playing Halo with a multi-lingual Abraham Lincoln.",2,Big Bang Theory,297,46
5297,Howard,4," Sheldon, don't take this the wrong way, but, you're insane.",2,Big Bang Theory,60,10
5298,Leonard,4," That may well be, but the fact is, it wouldn't kill us to meet some new people.",2,Big Bang Theory,80,17
5299,Sheldon,4," Uh, for the record, it could kill us to meet new people. They could be murderers, or the carriers of unusual pathogens, and I'm not insane, my mother had me tested.",2,Big Bang Theory,165,31
5300,Leonard,4," If we do get a new friend, he should be a guy you can trust. A guy who has your back.",2,Big Bang Theory,86,21
5301,Howard,4," And he should have a lot of money, and live in a cool place down by the beach where we could throw parties.",2,Big Bang Theory,108,23
5302,Sheldon,4, He should share our love of technology.,2,Big Bang Theory,40,7
5303,Howard,4, And he should know a lot of women.,2,Big Bang Theory,35,8
5304,Leonard,4," Yeah, let's see, money, women, technology, okay we're agreed, our new friend is going to be Iron Man.",2,Big Bang Theory,102,18
5306,Raj,4, Welcome to the Raj Mahal.,2,Big Bang Theory,26,5
5307,Penny,4," Yes, it's very nice, goodnight Raj.",2,Big Bang Theory,36,6
5308,Raj,4," No, wait, the evening's not over.",2,Big Bang Theory,34,6
5309,Penny,4, Yes it is.,2,Big Bang Theory,11,3
5310,Raj,4," No, it's time to put on some R. Kelly and suck face.",2,Big Bang Theory,53,12
5311,Penny,4," Oh, wow, is the evening over.",2,Big Bang Theory,30,6
5312,Raj,4," Wait, wait, that's my mummy and daddy calling from India. I want you to meet my parents.",2,Big Bang Theory,89,17
5313,Penny,4," Wait, meet them.",2,Big Bang Theory,17,3
5314,Raj,4," Hello mummy and daddy, good to see you. I'm not drunk.",2,Big Bang Theory,55,11
5316,Raj,4," Just making conversation. Mummy, daddy, I want you to meet my new squeeze, Penny.",2,Big Bang Theory,82,14
5317,Penny,4, I am not your squeeze. There is no squeezing.,2,Big Bang Theory,46,9
5319,Raj,4," Here you go, cute huh?",2,Big Bang Theory,23,5
5322,Penny,4," No, no, there's no sowing, no squeezing, and no sucking face.",2,Big Bang Theory,62,11
5324,Raj,4, What right do you have to pick who I can have children with?,2,Big Bang Theory,61,13
5326,Raj,4," Now you listen to me, I am no longer a child, and I will not be spoken to like one. Now if you'd excuse me, I have to go throw up.",2,Big Bang Theory,131,31
5328,Penny,4," I don't know, maybe it's the local cuisine. Okay, well, it's nice to meet you, just gonna set you on down over here, and I'm going to leave so, Namaste.  And FYI, you'd be lucky to have me as a daughter-in-law.",2,Big Bang Theory,211,41
5331,Penny,4," Raj, what are you doing. . No. No notes. If you have something to say to me, say it.",2,Big Bang Theory,85,19
5332,Raj,4, Sorry.,2,Big Bang Theory,7,1
5333,Penny,4," Oh, sweetie, it's okay. ",2,Big Bang Theory,25,4
5335,Sheldon,5," Good morning, Leonard.",2,Big Bang Theory,23,3
5336,Leonard,5, Uh-huh.,2,Big Bang Theory,8,1
5337,Sheldon,5," Yeah, we're going to have to stop by Pottery Barn on the way to work, I bought these Star Wars sheets but they turned out to be much too stimulating to be compatible with a good night's sleep. I don't like the way Darth Vader stares at me.",2,Big Bang Theory,240,48
5338,Leonard,5, I'm not going to work.,2,Big Bang Theory,23,5
5339,Sheldon,5," Oh, just because your career's been stagnant for a few years, that's no reason to give up.",2,Big Bang Theory,91,17
5340,Leonard,5," Sheldon, I was up all night using the new free-electron laser for my X-ray diffraction experiment.",2,Big Bang Theory,99,16
5341,Sheldon,5, Did the laser accidentally burn out your retinas?,2,Big Bang Theory,50,8
5342,Leonard,5, No.,2,Big Bang Theory,4,1
5343,Sheldon,5, Then you can drive. Let's go.,2,Big Bang Theory,30,6
5344,Leonard,5," Didn't I tell you I'd be working nights, and that you'd have to make other arrangements.",2,Big Bang Theory,89,16
5345,Sheldon,5, You did.,2,Big Bang Theory,9,2
5346,Leonard,5, And?,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
5347,Sheldon,5, I didn't. Let's go.,2,Big Bang Theory,20,4
5348,Leonard,5," Goodnight, Sheldon.",2,Big Bang Theory,20,2
5349,Sheldon,5, But how am I going to get to work?,2,Big Bang Theory,35,9
5350,Leonard,5, Take the bus.,2,Big Bang Theory,14,3
5351,Sheldon,5, I can't take the bus any more. They don't have seatbelts. And they won't let you lash yourself to the seat with bungee cords.,2,Big Bang Theory,126,24
5352,Leonard,5, You tried to lash yourself to the seat with bungee cords?,2,Big Bang Theory,58,11
5353,Sheldon,5," I didn't try, I succeeded. For some reason it alarmed the other passengers and I was asked to de-bus.",2,Big Bang Theory,102,19
5354,Leonard,5," Oh, you're a big boy, you'll figure it out.",2,Big Bang Theory,44,9
5355,Sheldon,5," Don't talk to me like I'm a child. Now, take me to return my star wars sheets!",2,Big Bang Theory,79,17
5357,Sheldon,5,"  Penny,  Penny,  Penny",2,Big Bang Theory,23,3
5358,Penny,5," Sheldon, what is it?",2,Big Bang Theory,21,4
5359,Sheldon,5, Leonard's asleep.,2,Big Bang Theory,18,2
5360,Penny,5, Thanks for the update ,2,Big Bang Theory,23,4
5361,Sheldon,5," No, wait. You have to drive me to work.",2,Big Bang Theory,40,9
5362,Penny,5," Yeah, uh, I really don't think I do.",2,Big Bang Theory,37,8
5363,Sheldon,5," But I don't drive, and I can't take the bus.",2,Big Bang Theory,45,10
5364,Penny,5," Yeah, honey, you'll be fine as long as you don't do that bungee cord thing, okay?",2,Big Bang Theory,82,16
5365,Sheldon,5, Penny. Didn't you recently state that you and I are friends?,2,Big Bang Theory,61,11
5366,Penny,5," Yes, Sheldon, we are friends.",2,Big Bang Theory,30,5
5367,Sheldon,5, Then I hereby invoke what I'm given to understand is an integral part of the implied covenant of friendship. The favour.,2,Big Bang Theory,121,21
5368,Penny,5," Oh, dear God.",2,Big Bang Theory,14,3
5369,Sheldon,5," I'm sorry, I didn't realize I was interrupting your morning prayers. When you're done, we'll go.",2,Big Bang Theory,97,16
5371,Sheldon,5, Thank you for driving me to work.,2,Big Bang Theory,34,7
5372,Penny,5," You know this is my day off, Sheldon.",2,Big Bang Theory,38,8
5373,Sheldon,5," Oh, good. I'm not keeping you from anything. Your check engine light is on.",2,Big Bang Theory,76,14
5374,Penny,5, Mm-hmm.,2,Big Bang Theory,8,1
5375,Sheldon,5," Typically that's an indicator. To, you know, check your engine.",2,Big Bang Theory,64,10
5376,Penny,5," It's fine, it's been on for, like, a month.",2,Big Bang Theory,44,9
5377,Sheldon,5," Well, actually, that would be all the more reason to, you know, check your engine.",2,Big Bang Theory,83,15
5378,Penny,5," Sheldon, it's fine.",2,Big Bang Theory,20,3
5379,Sheldon,5," If it were fine, the light wouldn't be on. That's why the manufacturer installed that light, to let you know it's not fine.",2,Big Bang Theory,124,23
5380,Penny,5," Uh, maybe the light's broken.",2,Big Bang Theory,30,5
5381,Sheldon,5, Is there a â€œcheck the check engine light lightâ€ù?  O-o-o-oh!,2,Big Bang Theory,64,10
5382,Penny,5, What?,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
5383,Sheldon,5," Studies have shown that performing tasks such as eating, talking on a cell phone or drinking coffee while driving reduces one's reaction time by the same factor as an ounce of alcohol.",2,Big Bang Theory,185,32
5384,Penny,5, Do you have any alcohol?,2,Big Bang Theory,25,5
5385,Sheldon,5, Of course not.,2,Big Bang Theory,15,3
5386,Penny,5, Too bad.,2,Big Bang Theory,9,2
5387,Sheldon,5, You're going up Euclid Avenue?,2,Big Bang Theory,31,5
5388,Penny,5, Mm-hmm.,2,Big Bang Theory,8,1
5389,Sheldon,5, Leonard takes Los Robles Avenue.,2,Big Bang Theory,33,5
5390,Penny,5," Well, good for Leonard.",2,Big Bang Theory,24,4
5391,Sheldon,5," Euclid Avenue is shorter as the crow flies, but it has speed bumps, which appreciably increase point-to-point drive time, making it the less efficient choice. But you have the conn. Of course, if you're not going to slow down for the speed bumps, I withdraw my previous objection. Here's a fun question. Do you know what the most common street name is?",2,Big Bang Theory,353,62
5392,Penny,5, No.,2,Big Bang Theory,4,1
5393,Sheldon,5," The answer's tricky. It's Second Street. You see, you'd think it would be First Street, but in most towns, First Street eventually gets renamed to something else, you know, like Main Street, Broad Street, Michigan Avenue. Leonard and I often use our commute time to exercise our minds with brain-teasers like that. We also play games. Would you like to play one?",2,Big Bang Theory,363,62
5394,Penny,5, No.,2,Big Bang Theory,4,1
5395,Sheldon,5," Oh, come on, it's fun. Ooh! Another bump. Okay. I'll say an element, and uh, you say an element whose name starts with the last letter of the one I said, okay? I'll start. Helium. Now, you could say Mercury. That would give me a Y. Ooh. Very clever, that's a tough one. So I go Ytterbium, which gets you back to M. So you go Molybdenum, and I say Magnesium, you say Manganese, and I say Europium, and, and you're left with Mendelevium, and there are no more M's because I believe that Meitnerium should still be called Ekairidium, so congratulations, you win. Do you wanna go again?",2,Big Bang Theory,583,109
5396,Penny,5, How about we just have a little quiet time now?,2,Big Bang Theory,48,10
5397,Sheldon,5," All right. Hmm, huh, I'm sorry, I'm finding your reckless nonchalance regarding the check-engine light to be very troubling.",2,Big Bang Theory,125,19
5398,Penny,5, Get out.,2,Big Bang Theory,9,2
5399,Sheldon,5," Well, I have to tell you that while I do have a theoretical understanding of the workings of an internal combustion engine, I'm not sure I'm capable of performing diagnostics.",2,Big Bang Theory,176,30
5400,Penny,5," I said, get out.",2,Big Bang Theory,17,4
5401,Sheldon,5, Okay. I'll give it a shot. ,2,Big Bang Theory,28,6
5403,Sheldon,5," Oh, Leonard, there you are, I'm ready to go home.",2,Big Bang Theory,50,10
5404,Leonard,5, I just got here.,2,Big Bang Theory,17,4
5405,Sheldon,5," Good, perfect timing.",2,Big Bang Theory,22,3
5406,Leonard,5," Sheldon, I told you, I only have access to the free-electron laser at night. I can't drive you for the next few weeks.",2,Big Bang Theory,119,23
5407,Sheldon,5," No, you said you couldn't drive me to work, this is from work.",2,Big Bang Theory,63,13
5408,Leonard,5," Howard, help me out here.",2,Big Bang Theory,26,5
5409,Howard,5," No, just for the fun of it, I'm gonna take his side.",2,Big Bang Theory,53,12
5410,Sheldon,5," Now, how do you propose I get home?",2,Big Bang Theory,36,8
5411,Leonard,5, How did you get here in the first place?,2,Big Bang Theory,41,9
5412,Sheldon,5, Penny. But I sense that's no longer an option.,2,Big Bang Theory,47,9
5413,Leonard,5," Look, I need to get to the laser lab, you're just going to have to find someone else to take you home.",2,Big Bang Theory,103,22
5414,Howard,5," Oh damn, I picked the wrong side.",2,Big Bang Theory,34,7
5416,Sheldon,5," Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! Oh God, not Euclid Avenue! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa!",2,Big Bang Theory,63,7
5418,Raj,5, Why did Howard leave you in the middle of the road anyway?,2,Big Bang Theory,59,12
5419,Sheldon,5, We had a difference of opinion.,2,Big Bang Theory,32,6
5420,Raj,5, Over what?,2,Big Bang Theory,11,2
5421,Sheldon,5," Whether or not he was trying to kill me. For the record, I maintain he was. Where are you going?",2,Big Bang Theory,97,20
5422,Raj,5, I'm taking you home.,2,Big Bang Theory,21,4
5423,Sheldon,5," Oh, but I'm not going home. It's Wednesday, Wednesday is new comic book day, we have to go to the comic book store. And then we have to stop at Soup Plantation, it's creamy tomato soup day, and Radio Shack, there's a sale on triple-a batteries. Plus, we have to go to Pottery Barn and return my Star Wars sheets.",2,Big Bang Theory,313,60
5424,Raj,5, I have a better idea.,2,Big Bang Theory,22,5
5425,Sheldon,5, You want to go to pottery barn first?,2,Big Bang Theory,38,8
5427,Sheldon,5," Can you drive me to Pottery Barn?  Maybe if I turn off the night-light, I can keep the sheets.",2,Big Bang Theory,95,19
5429,Sheldon,5, Good morning.,2,Big Bang Theory,14,2
5431,Leonard,5," Sheldon, sit down.",2,Big Bang Theory,19,3
5432,Sheldon,5," She's in my spot. Don't look at me like that, everybody knows that my spot.",2,Big Bang Theory,76,15
5433,Penny,5," Sheldon, you know that we care about you.",2,Big Bang Theory,42,8
5434,Howard,5, And it's because we care about you that we've decided we have to speak up.,2,Big Bang Theory,75,15
5435,Penny,5," You're hurting the people around you, sweetie.",2,Big Bang Theory,47,7
5436,Leonard,5," So we made you an appointment, and we want you to keep it.",2,Big Bang Theory,59,13
5437,Sheldon,5, Department of motor vehicles new driver handbook? But I don't have a problem.,2,Big Bang Theory,78,13
5438,Leonard,5," Sheldon, you need to learn how to drive.",2,Big Bang Theory,41,8
5439,Howard,5, This madness has to stop.,2,Big Bang Theory,26,5
5440,Leonard,5," Penny's taking you to the DMV, I'm going to bed.",2,Big Bang Theory,49,10
5441,Sheldon,5, Why Penny?,2,Big Bang Theory,11,2
5442,Leonard,5," Because rock breaks scissors, goodnight.",2,Big Bang Theory,41,5
5443,Penny,5," All right, come on Sheldon.",2,Big Bang Theory,28,5
5444,Sheldon,5," Hold on, I have one condition.",2,Big Bang Theory,31,6
5445,Penny,5, What?,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
5446,Sheldon,5, We have to stop at Pottery Barn.,2,Big Bang Theory,33,7
5447,Penny,5, Okay.,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
5448,Sheldon,5, And Radio Shack.,2,Big Bang Theory,17,3
5449,Penny,5, Fine.,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
5450,Sheldon,5, And the comic book store.,2,Big Bang Theory,26,5
5451,Penny,5, All right! ,2,Big Bang Theory,12,2
5452,Howard,5," Ooh, I want to go to the comic book store. ",2,Big Bang Theory,44,10
5453,Raj,5, I like comic books.,2,Big Bang Theory,20,4
5455,Sheldon,5," I just don't see why I need a driver's license, Albert Einstein never had a driver's license.",2,Big Bang Theory,94,17
5456,Howard,5," Yeah, but Albert Einstein didn't make me wet myself at 40 miles an hour.",2,Big Bang Theory,73,14
5457,Penny,5," Yeah, and I never wanted to kick Albert Einstein in the nuts. You know, I gotta ask, why didn't you just get a license at 16 like everybody else?",2,Big Bang Theory,146,29
5458,Sheldon,5, I was otherwise engaged.,2,Big Bang Theory,25,4
5459,Penny,5, Doing what?,2,Big Bang Theory,12,2
5460,Sheldon,5, Examining perturbative amplitudes in n=4 supersymmetric theories leading to a re-examination of the ultraviolet properties of multi-loop n=8 supergravity using modern twistor theory.,2,Big Bang Theory,183,23
5461,Penny,5," Well, how 'bout when you were 17?",2,Big Bang Theory,34,7
5463,Sheldon,5, I'm actually more of a theorist.,2,Big Bang Theory,33,6
5464,Howard,5," The application in your hand, give it to her.",2,Big Bang Theory,46,9
5465,Sheldon,5, Oh.,2,Big Bang Theory,4,1
5467,Sheldon,5," Excuse me, but I have some concerns about these questions.",2,Big Bang Theory,59,10
5469,Sheldon,5, Yes?,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
5471,Sheldon,5, No.,2,Big Bang Theory,4,1
5473,Sheldon,5," Just, look, see, this first question makes no sense, how many car lengths should you leave in front of you when driving? There's no possible way to answer that, a car length is not a standardized unit of measure.",2,Big Bang Theory,213,39
5475,Penny,5," Sheldon, it's C, just put down C.",2,Big Bang Theory,34,7
5476,Sheldon,5," I don't need your help, Penny.",2,Big Bang Theory,31,6
5478,Sheldon,5," No, no, wait, no, hang on, look at this next question.",2,Big Bang Theory,55,11
5479,Howard,5," Sheldon, why are you arguing with the DMV?",2,Big Bang Theory,43,8
5480,Sheldon,5," How else are they going to learn? Look, question 2, when are roadways most slippery? Now, okay, there are three answers, none of which are correct. The correct answer is, when covered by a film of liquid sufficient to reduce the coefficient of static friction between the tire and the road to essentially zero, but not so deep as to introduce a new source of friction.",2,Big Bang Theory,369,66
5482,Sheldon,5, But I'm not done. I have many additional concerns about these questions.,2,Big Bang Theory,73,12
5484,Penny,5," Come on, let's go.",2,Big Bang Theory,19,4
5486,Sheldon,5, Aced it.,2,Big Bang Theory,9,2
5488,Howard,5," Okay, that's it, let's boot it up.",2,Big Bang Theory,35,7
5489,Leonard,5, Booting.,2,Big Bang Theory,9,1
5490,Howard,5, This is a state-of-the-art simulator. I adapted it from something a friend of mine designed for the army.,2,Big Bang Theory,106,18
5491,Sheldon,5," Is that why I appear to be in downtown Fallujah, behind the wheel of an up-armored Humvee?",2,Big Bang Theory,91,17
5492,Howard,5, I haven't configured it yet. Let's see Bradley tank transport truck Batmobile,2,Big Bang Theory,78,12
5493,Sheldon,5, Ooh!,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
5494,Leonard,5, No.,2,Big Bang Theory,4,1
5495,Howard,5," Here we go, red 2006 Ford Taurus on the streets of Pasadena.",2,Big Bang Theory,61,12
5496,Sheldon,5, Hmmmm?,2,Big Bang Theory,7,1
5497,Howard,5, What?,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
5498,Sheldon,5," Statistically, red cars are stopped by police far more often than any other colour. I don't want any hassles with the fuzz.",2,Big Bang Theory,124,22
5499,Howard,5," Fine, what colour do you want?",2,Big Bang Theory,31,6
5500,Sheldon,5," You know the pale blue of Luke Skywalker's lightsaber, before it was digitally remastered?",2,Big Bang Theory,91,14
5501,Howard,5, Black it is.,2,Big Bang Theory,13,3
5502,Leonard,5," Okay, now, what you want to do first is turn on the ignition and shift into drive.",2,Big Bang Theory,83,17
5503,Sheldon,5, I haven't fastened my seat belt yet.,2,Big Bang Theory,37,7
5504,Leonard,5," Okay, fasten your seat belt.",2,Big Bang Theory,29,5
5505,Sheldon,5," Click. Now, are there air bags?",2,Big Bang Theory,32,6
5506,Leonard,5, You don't need air bags.,2,Big Bang Theory,25,5
5507,Sheldon,5, What if a simulated van rear-ends me?,2,Big Bang Theory,38,7
5508,Penny,5, I'll hit you in the face with a pillow.,2,Big Bang Theory,40,9
5509,Leonard,5," Okay, now shift into drive, pull out slowly into traffic.",2,Big Bang Theory,58,10
5510,Penny,5, Oh.,2,Big Bang Theory,4,1
5511,Leonard,5, Oh.,2,Big Bang Theory,4,1
5512,Howard,5, Oh.,2,Big Bang Theory,4,1
5513,Leonard,5, Watch out.,2,Big Bang Theory,11,2
5514,Howard,5, Oh God!,2,Big Bang Theory,8,2
5515,Leonard,5," Watch, watch out, watch out for pedestrians!",2,Big Bang Theory,45,7
5516,Penny,5," Oh God, wait, slow, hit the brakes, hit the brakes!",2,Big Bang Theory,52,10
5517,Sheldon,5, Thank you.,2,Big Bang Theory,11,2
5519,Sheldon,5, Sorry excuse me my bad student driver,2,Big Bang Theory,38,7
5520,Leonard,5, How did you manage to get on the second floor of the Glendale galleria?,2,Big Bang Theory,72,14
5521,Sheldon,5," I don't know. I was on the Pasadena freeway, I missed my exit, flew off the overpass, and one thing led to another.",2,Big Bang Theory,116,23
5522,Leonard,5, Maybe you want to give it a rest and try again tomorrow.,2,Big Bang Theory,57,12
5523,Sheldon,5, No. I quit. ,2,Big Bang Theory,13,3
5524,Leonard,5," Aw, the pet store?",2,Big Bang Theory,19,4
5525,Sheldon,5," Remind me to compliment Wolowitz on the software, it's amazingly detailed.",2,Big Bang Theory,75,11
5526,Leonard,5," So wait,you're just gonna give up?",2,Big Bang Theory,35,6
5527,Sheldon,5," No, I'm not giving up, I never give up.",2,Big Bang Theory,40,9
5528,Leonard,5, So what is it you're doing?,2,Big Bang Theory,28,6
5529,Sheldon,5, I'm transcending the situation. I'm clearly too evolved for driving.,2,Big Bang Theory,69,10
5530,Leonard,5, What does that mean?,2,Big Bang Theory,21,4
5531,Sheldon,5," Leonard, have you ever wondered why my little toes and lateral incisors are significantly smaller than the average for someone of my size?",2,Big Bang Theory,139,23
5532,Leonard,5," I wonder a lot of things about you, Sheldon, but not not that.",2,Big Bang Theory,63,13
5533,Sheldon,5," Well, those are indicators that I'm farther along the evolutionary scale than the average human.",2,Big Bang Theory,97,15
5534,Leonard,5, No kidding.,2,Big Bang Theory,12,2
5535,Sheldon,5," Well, no, no, I'm not going to go so far as to say that I represent a distinct new stage in humankind, you know, a Homo Novus, if you will, no, that's for anthropologists to decide. But I am convinced that the reason I cannot master the plebeian task of driving is because I'm not meant to.",2,Big Bang Theory,291,57
5536,Leonard,5," Yes, you are, you're meant to learn how to drive. Please learn how to drive!",2,Big Bang Theory,77,15
5537,Sheldon,5," No, no. Leonard, I'm meant for greater things, like unraveling the mysteries of the universe, not determining when it's safe to pass a stopped school bus on a country road.",2,Big Bang Theory,173,30
5538,Leonard,5, It's never safe.,2,Big Bang Theory,17,3
5539,Sheldon,5," Yeah, well, I know that now.",2,Big Bang Theory,29,6
5540,Leonard,5," Fine. Assuming that everything you say is true, how does the biologically superior Homo Novus get to work tomorrow morning?",2,Big Bang Theory,124,20
5541,Sheldon,5, Homo Novus doesn't know.,2,Big Bang Theory,25,4
5542,Leonard,5," Well, hang in there, maybe you'll evolve into something with wings.",2,Big Bang Theory,68,11
5544,Sheldon,5," Good morning, gentlemen.",2,Big Bang Theory,25,3
5545,Leonard,5, Hey.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
5546,Raj,5, Good morning. Is there some new kind of casual Friday I don't know about?,2,Big Bang Theory,74,14
5547,Leonard,5," No, he lives here now.",2,Big Bang Theory,23,5
5548,Howard,5, Really? Why?,2,Big Bang Theory,13,2
5549,Leonard,5," Well, since he won't take the bus and he's too evolved to drive, he decided it would be easier to just sleep in his office and shower in the radiation lab until I'm finished with my experiment.",2,Big Bang Theory,194,37
5550,Raj,5, But you finished your experiment a week ago.,2,Big Bang Theory,45,8
5551,Leonard,5, Yep,2,Big Bang Theory,4,1
5556,Sheldon,5, You saw nothing! ,2,Big Bang Theory,18,3
5558,Leonard,6," So, if any of you are considering going into experimental physics, my door is always open. Once again, I'm sorry that the demonstration didn't quite work out, but now we know what happens when you accidentally spill peach Snapple into a helium neon laser. Short answer is don't. And now to tell you about the theoretical physics department is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Dr. Cooper?",2,Big Bang Theory,375,64
5559,Sheldon,6, Forget it.,2,Big Bang Theory,11,2
5560,Leonard,6," Excuse me. Sheldon, we both agreed to do this.",2,Big Bang Theory,47,9
5561,Sheldon,6, It's a waste of time. I might as well explain the laws of thermodynamics to a bunch of labradoodles.,2,Big Bang Theory,101,19
5562,Leonard,6," If you don't do this, I won't take you to the comic book store.",2,Big Bang Theory,64,14
5563,Sheldon,6," Hello. Nice work with the laser, by the way. Looking out at your fresh young faces, I remember when I too was deciding my academic future as a lowly graduate student. Of course, I was 14, and I'd already achieved more than most of you could ever hope to, despite my 9 o'clock bedtime. Now, there may be one or two of you in this room who has what it takes to succeed in theoretical physics, although, it's more likely that you'll spend your scientific careers teaching fifth graders how to make paper mache volcanoes with baking soda lava.",2,Big Bang Theory,540,99
5564,Leonard,6," Oh, good God.",2,Big Bang Theory,14,3
5565,Sheldon,6," In short, anyone who told you that you would someday be able to make any significant contribution to physics played a cruel trick on you, a cruel trick indeed. Any questions? Of course not. I weep for the future of science. Now if you'll excuse me, the latest issue of Batman is out. Come, Leonard.",2,Big Bang Theory,299,55
5566,Leonard,6," Laser demonstration's looking pretty good now, huh?",2,Big Bang Theory,52,7
5568,Raj,6," I love this time of the year. The leaves are turning, there's a bracing chill in the air.",2,Big Bang Theory,90,18
5569,Howard,6," Plus there's a whole new crop of female grad students about to put on just enough winter weight to make them needy and vulnerable. That's right, honey, have another calzone, Daddy can wait.",2,Big Bang Theory,190,33
5570,Raj,6, Isn't there a university policy against dating graduate students?,2,Big Bang Theory,66,9
5571,Leonard,6," No, if you can talk to them, you can ask them out.",2,Big Bang Theory,51,12
5572,Raj,6," Damn, there's always a catch.",2,Big Bang Theory,30,5
5574,Leonard,6," Hey, Leslie.",2,Big Bang Theory,13,2
5576,Sheldon,6, The truth can indeed be a finger down the throat of those unprepared to hear it. But why should I cater to second-rate minds?,2,Big Bang Theory,126,24
5578,Sheldon,6," Oh, yeah? Well you're a mean person.",2,Big Bang Theory,37,7
5580,Sheldon,6, That is the prevailing opinion.,2,Big Bang Theory,32,5
5582,Howard,6," Howard Wolowitz, department of engineering, co-designer of the International Space Station's Liquid Waste Disposal System.",2,Big Bang Theory,123,15
5584,Sheldon,6," Amazing, an intelligent labradoodle.",2,Big Bang Theory,37,4
5585,Howard,6, Woof.,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
5586,Sheldon,6, The fact is I'm quite close to a breakthrough in showing how neutrinos emerge from a string-net condensate.,2,Big Bang Theory,108,18
5588,Sheldon,6, It's what I do.,2,Big Bang Theory,16,4
5589,Howard,6," You know, the Pishkin-Wolowitz Liquid Waste Disposal System is turning a few heads as well.",2,Big Bang Theory,92,15
5591,Sheldon,6, I don't drink coffee.,2,Big Bang Theory,22,4
5592,Howard,6, I do. I love me a cup of joe.,2,Big Bang Theory,30,9
5594,Sheldon,6, I do eat dinner.,2,Big Bang Theory,17,4
5596,Sheldon,6, I never eat in strange restaurants. One runs the risk of non-standard cutlery.,2,Big Bang Theory,79,13
5598,Leonard,6, Sheldon lives in fear of the three-tined fork.,2,Big Bang Theory,47,8
5599,Sheldon,6," Three tines is not a fork, three tines is a trident. Forks are for eating, tridents are for ruling the seven seas.",2,Big Bang Theory,115,22
5601,Sheldon,6," That would be acceptable. On Mondays, I eat Thai food. Mee krob and chicken sate with extra peanut sauce from Siam Palace.",2,Big Bang Theory,123,22
5603,Sheldon,6, What a nice girl.,2,Big Bang Theory,18,4
5604,Howard,6," Sheldon, do you have any idea what just happened?",2,Big Bang Theory,50,9
5605,Sheldon,6, Yes. Apparently I'm getting a free dinner.,2,Big Bang Theory,43,7
5607,Penny,6," Oh, yeah, no, this thing's majorly out of order.  See? Sorry.",2,Big Bang Theory,62,11
5609,Penny,6, Where you going?,2,Big Bang Theory,17,3
5611,Penny,6," Oh, are you here to see Leonard?",2,Big Bang Theory,33,7
5613,Penny,6, Dr. Sheldon Cooper?,2,Big Bang Theory,20,3
5615,Penny,6," Sheldon Cooper? Tall, thin, looks a little like a giant praying mantis?",2,Big Bang Theory,72,12
5617,Penny,6, Sheldon Cooper?,2,Big Bang Theory,16,2
5620,Leonard,6," Hey, Ramona. Come on in.",2,Big Bang Theory,25,5
5622,Leonard,6," Uh, the kitchen's fine.  Hey, what are you doing?",2,Big Bang Theory,50,9
5623,Penny,6, I need to see this.,2,Big Bang Theory,20,5
5624,Leonard,6," Uh-huh. The viewing area's right over there. Sheldon, your girl date person Ramona's here.",2,Big Bang Theory,91,14
5625,Sheldon,6," Oh, hello.",2,Big Bang Theory,11,2
5627,Sheldon,6, Did you enjoy the humorous footnote where I illustrate mirror-symmetry by likening it to the Flash playing tennis with himself?,2,Big Bang Theory,128,20
5629,Sheldon,6, My hypotheses tend to have that effect.,2,Big Bang Theory,40,7
5631,Leonard,6," Oh, yeah. No, we were just going.",2,Big Bang Theory,34,7
5632,Howard,6," To watch, right?",2,Big Bang Theory,17,3
5633,Leonard,6," No, come on, now, we're going out.",2,Big Bang Theory,35,7
5634,Penny,6," Oh, come on, we'll be quiet.",2,Big Bang Theory,29,6
5635,Leonard,6," Let's go. Okay, you two, just, have a nice whatever this is.",2,Big Bang Theory,61,12
5636,Penny,6," Okay, you guys, look, I know this is none of my business, but I just, I have to ask, what's Sheldon's deal?",2,Big Bang Theory,108,22
5637,Leonard,6, What do you mean â€œdealâ€ù?,2,Big Bang Theory,29,5
5638,Penny,6," You know, like what's his deal? Is it girls? Guys? Sock puppets?",2,Big Bang Theory,65,12
5639,Leonard,6," Honestly, we've been operating under the assumption that he has no deal.",2,Big Bang Theory,73,12
5640,Penny,6," Come on, everybody has a deal.",2,Big Bang Theory,31,6
5641,Howard,6," Not Sheldon. Over the years, we've formulated many theories about how he might reproduce. I'm an advocate of mytosis.",2,Big Bang Theory,118,19
5642,Penny,6, I'm sorry?,2,Big Bang Theory,11,2
5643,Howard,6, I believe one day Sheldon will eat an enormous amount of Thai food and split into two Sheldons.,2,Big Bang Theory,96,18
5644,Leonard,6," On the other hand, I think Sheldon might be the larval form of his species, and someday he'll spin a cocoon and emerge two months later with moth wings and an exoskeleton.",2,Big Bang Theory,172,32
5645,Penny,6," Okay, well, thanks for the nightmares.",2,Big Bang Theory,39,6
5646,Leonard,6," Hey, do you want to hang out with us?",2,Big Bang Theory,38,9
5647,Penny,6, What are you guys gonna do?,2,Big Bang Theory,28,6
5648,Leonard,6, Uh,2,Big Bang Theory,3,1
5649,Howard,6, My mom's making a brisket tonight.,2,Big Bang Theory,35,6
5650,Leonard,6, The one with the little onions? Mmm.,2,Big Bang Theory,37,7
5651,Penny,6," Yeah, I'm busy, so, goodnight.",2,Big Bang Theory,31,5
5652,Howard,6, Her loss. Let's go.,2,Big Bang Theory,20,4
5653,Raj,6, Brisket party! B-to-the-R-to-the-I-S-K To-the-E-to-the-T Ooh,2,Big Bang Theory,61,5
5654,Leonard,6, Don't.,2,Big Bang Theory,7,1
5656,Leonard,6," Hey, aren't you having breakfast?",2,Big Bang Theory,34,5
5657,Sheldon,6, Yes.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
5658,Leonard,6, Are you experimenting with nutritional suppositories again?,2,Big Bang Theory,60,7
5659,Sheldon,6, Not in these pants.,2,Big Bang Theory,20,4
5660,Leonard,6," So, how'd it go with Ramona last night?",2,Big Bang Theory,40,8
5661,Sheldon,6," Oh, great. She's smart, insightful and she has a very unique way of, you know, revering me.",2,Big Bang Theory,92,17
5663,Sheldon,6, Thank you. Did anyone touch it?,2,Big Bang Theory,32,6
5665,Sheldon,6, Ramona pointed out that I've been wasting 20 minutes a day standing on cafeteria lines.,2,Big Bang Theory,88,15
5667,Sheldon,6," You don't tackle the big issues, Ramona. You fence with them. En garde. Riposte.",2,Big Bang Theory,81,14
5668,Leonard,6, Touche.,2,Big Bang Theory,8,1
5670,Leonard,6," Ah, hey Leslie.",2,Big Bang Theory,16,3
5673,Sheldon,6," Oh, good one.",2,Big Bang Theory,14,3
5676,Leonard,6, Wait for me.,2,Big Bang Theory,13,3
5678,Sheldon,6," Well, to paraphrase Mozart, all the subatomic particles are there, I just have to put them in the right order.",2,Big Bang Theory,111,20
5680,Sheldon,6, Aren't I?,2,Big Bang Theory,10,2
5682,Penny,6," Hey, guys, this package came for y",2,Big Bang Theory,35,7
5684,Sheldon,6," Yes, I'm close to a breakthrough. Ooh, it tickles",2,Big Bang Theory,50,9
5685,Penny,6, Sorry.   Holy crap on a cracker.,2,Big Bang Theory,33,6
5686,Leonard,6," Hey, Penny.",2,Big Bang Theory,12,2
5687,Penny,6," Hi. You know, you probably don't want to go in there.",2,Big Bang Theory,54,11
5688,Leonard,6, Why? What are they doing?,2,Big Bang Theory,26,5
5689,Penny,6," You know, the only way I could explain it would be in a therapist's office with dolls.",2,Big Bang Theory,87,17
5690,Leonard,6, Hoo-boy.,2,Big Bang Theory,9,1
5692,Leonard,6," Yeah, I can see that. Sheldon, Halo night, Koothrappali's. You coming?",2,Big Bang Theory,71,11
5693,Sheldon,6," Oh, yes, it's Halo night. Let me just dry my tootsies.",2,Big Bang Theory,55,11
5695,Sheldon,6," Yes, I am. It's Wednesday. Wednesday's Halo night.</i>",2,Big Bang Theory,55,8
5697,Sheldon,6, He did.,2,Big Bang Theory,8,2
5699,Sheldon,6," Me. Sorry, Leonard.",2,Big Bang Theory,20,3
5700,Leonard,6, Seriously? You're not coming?,2,Big Bang Theory,30,4
5701,Sheldon,6, You heard her. How can I argue with me?,2,Big Bang Theory,40,9
5702,Leonard,6," Okay, well, once again, you guys have a good whatever this is.",2,Big Bang Theory,63,12
5704,Sheldon,6, I prefer to think of it as I'm pulling them forward.,2,Big Bang Theory,53,11
5706,Sheldon,6, He does on Wednesdays.,2,Big Bang Theory,23,4
5708,Sheldon,6, He does want that. Does a man with my intellectual gifts play paintball on weekends?,2,Big Bang Theory,85,15
5710,Sheldon,6, Drat.,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
5712,Sheldon,6, I suppose. Battlestar Galactica comes on tonight.  I guess I can wait for the DVD.  And then never ever watch it.,2,Big Bang Theory,114,21
5715,Sheldon,6," Penny,  Penny,  Penny",2,Big Bang Theory,22,3
5716,Penny,6," Sheldon, honey, I've told you, it's a small apartment, you only have to knock one time.",2,Big Bang Theory,88,16
5717,Sheldon,6," Please, please, I don't have a lot of time. Look, Ramona finally dozed off, and I need you to help me get rid of her.",2,Big Bang Theory,118,25
5718,Penny,6, Get rid of her how?,2,Big Bang Theory,20,5
5719,Sheldon,6," I don't know, but apparently I'm in some kind of relationship, and you seem to be an expert at ending them.",2,Big Bang Theory,108,21
5720,Penny,6, Excuse me?,2,Big Bang Theory,11,2
5721,Sheldon,6, I see man after man leaving this apartment never to return.,2,Big Bang Theory,60,11
5722,Penny,6," Okay, first of all, it is not man after man.",2,Big Bang Theory,45,10
5724,Sheldon,6, Hide me.,2,Big Bang Theory,9,2
5725,Penny,6, Hide you?,2,Big Bang Theory,10,2
5726,Sheldon,6, I formally request sanctuary.,2,Big Bang Theory,30,4
5728,Sheldon,6," Um she distracted me. I told you, Penny, I don't have time for your nonsense, I have important things to do.",2,Big Bang Theory,109,21
5729,Penny,6," Oh, man.",2,Big Bang Theory,9,2
5731,Penny,6," Really? Well, then will you explain it to me?",2,Big Bang Theory,46,9
5733,Penny,6," Uh, yeah, no, that's not it.",2,Big Bang Theory,29,6
5735,Penny,6," Oh, gee, okay.",2,Big Bang Theory,15,3
5737,Penny,6," Yeah, he's a gift all right.",2,Big Bang Theory,29,6
5739,Penny,6," Um, sure, sisters.  Holy crap on a cracker.",2,Big Bang Theory,44,8
5741,Leonard,6, Sheldon?  What are you doing?!,2,Big Bang Theory,31,5
5742,Sheldon,6, It's Morse code.,2,Big Bang Theory,17,3
5743,Leonard,6, Why?,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
5744,Sheldon,6, So we can communicate through the wall.,2,Big Bang Theory,40,7
5745,Leonard,6, We are communicating through the wall.,2,Big Bang Theory,39,6
5746,Sheldon,6," Yes, but the communication is not encrypted.",2,Big Bang Theory,45,7

5865,Sheldon,7, Is my hamburger medium well?,2,Big Bang Theory,29,5

5888,Penny,7, Thank you.,2,Big Bang Theory,11,2
5889,Sheldon,7," Oh, do we have to suffer through this transparently manipulative pseudo-reality again?",2,Big Bang Theory,87,12
5891,Sheldon,7, You and I have a standing TV schedule which is the result of extensive debate and compromise. Any alterations except for breaking news have to be pre-approved at the weekly roommate meeting.,2,Big Bang Theory,191,32
5892,Leonard,7, Put it on the agenda.,2,Big Bang Theory,22,5
5893,Sheldon,7, But you have to make a motion to put it on agenda.,2,Big Bang Theory,51,12
5894,Leonard,7," Oh, I'll make a motion, but you're not going to like it.",2,Big Bang Theory,57,12
5895,Sheldon,7, Fine. Mock Parliamentary procedure. At least put it on mute.,2,Big Bang Theory,61,10

5904,Sheldon,7, Why would you do that?,2,Big Bang Theory,23,5
5905,Penny,7, I don't know. I was hungry? What's the big deal?,2,Big Bang Theory,49,10
5906,Sheldon,7, The big deal is that nobody touches food on my plate.,2,Big Bang Theory,54,11
5907,Penny,7," All right. Look, I didn't know, I'm sorry.",2,Big Bang Theory,43,8
5908,Sheldon,7," Well, I'm sorry, but that is your second strike.",2,Big Bang Theory,49,9
5909,Penny,7, What?,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
5910,Sheldon,7, You have two strikes. Three strikes and you're out. It's a sports metaphor.,2,Big Bang Theory,76,13
5911,Penny,7, A sports metaphor?,2,Big Bang Theory,19,3
5912,Sheldon,7," Yes, baseball.",2,Big Bang Theory,15,2
5913,Penny,7," All right, yeah, I'll play along. What was my first strike?",2,Big Bang Theory,60,11

5916,Sheldon,7, The photo of the cat who wants to â€œhas cheezburgerâ€ù?,2,Big Bang Theory,57,10
5917,Penny,7," Oh, come on, everybody loves LOLcats. They're cute and they can't spell 'cause they're cats.",2,Big Bang Theory,93,15
5918,Sheldon,7," I trusted you with my email address, and you betrayed that trust by sending me Internet banality, strike one. Touching my food, strike two.",2,Big Bang Theory,140,24
5919,Leonard,7, Don't worry. They only stay on your record for a year.,2,Big Bang Theory,55,11
5920,Howard,7," You can get them removed early, but you have to take his class.",2,Big Bang Theory,64,13
5921,Penny,7," Come on, I touched one onion ring.",2,Big Bang Theory,35,7
5922,Sheldon,7," And then you put it back, compromising the integrity of all the other onion rings.",2,Big Bang Theory,83,15
5923,Penny,7," Oh, honey, the buses don't go where you live, do they?",2,Big Bang Theory,55,11

5937,Leonard,7," Listen, don't worry. I'll talk to him.",2,Big Bang Theory,39,7
5938,Penny,7," Yeah, you do that.",2,Big Bang Theory,19,4
5939,Leonard,7," Just so I know, would you be open to taking his class? You can do it online!",2,Big Bang Theory,77,17
5941,Howard,7, So based on our triangulation we've narrowed down the location of the top model house to three square miles in the Hollywood Hills.,2,Big Bang Theory,132,23
5942,Raj,7," Or possibly Durham, North Carolina.",2,Big Bang Theory,36,5
5943,Howard,7," When we find it, you want to go with us?",2,Big Bang Theory,41,10
5944,Leonard,7, To do what?,2,Big Bang Theory,12,3
5945,Raj,7," Party with the pretty girls, dude!",2,Big Bang Theory,35,6
5946,Leonard,7," Are you insane? You're not going to party with them, you're not even going to get anywhere near that place.",2,Big Bang Theory,108,20
5947,Howard,7, That's what they said to Neil Armstrong about the moon.,2,Big Bang Theory,56,10
5948,Sheldon,7," No one said anything of the kind to Neil Armstrong, the entire nation dedicated a decade of effort and treasure to put a man on the moon.",2,Big Bang Theory,138,27
5949,Howard,7," Well, my fellow Americans, before this year is out we will put a Wolowitz on one of America's top models.",2,Big Bang Theory,106,20
5950,Raj,7, And a large number of people will believe it never happened.,2,Big Bang Theory,61,11
5951,Penny,7," Okay, let me guess. A quesadilla with soy cheese for the lactose-intolerant Leonard.",2,Big Bang Theory,85,13
5952,Leonard,7, Thank you.,2,Big Bang Theory,11,2
5953,Penny,7," Shrimp Caesar salad with no almonds for the highly allergic kosher-only-on-the-high-holidays Howard, and for our suddenly back on the Hindu wagon Raj, meatlover's pizza, no meat. Coming right up.",2,Big Bang Theory,196,29
5954,Sheldon,7," Wait. Excuse me. You forgot my barbecue bacon cheeseburger, barbecue sauce, bacon and cheese on the side.",2,Big Bang Theory,106,17
5955,Penny,7," Oh, I didn't tell you? You're banished from the Cheesecake Factory.",2,Big Bang Theory,68,11
5956,Sheldon,7, Why?,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
5957,Penny,7," Well, you have three strikes. One, coming in. Two, sitting down. And three, I don't like your attitude.",2,Big Bang Theory,104,18
5958,Sheldon,7," You can't do that. Not only is it a violation of California state law, it flies directly in the face of Cheesecake Factory policy.",2,Big Bang Theory,131,24
5959,Penny,7," Yeah, no, there's a new policy. No shoes, no shirt, no Sheldon.",2,Big Bang Theory,64,12

5962,Penny,7, Hi.,2,Big Bang Theory,4,1
5963,Leonard,7," Look, here's the thing, um, I talked to Sheldon and he feels terrible and he agrees that he was unreasonable and out of line.",2,Big Bang Theory,126,24
5964,Penny,7," Really? Well, that's great.",2,Big Bang Theory,28,4
5965,Leonard,7," Yeah, so just apologize to him, okay?",2,Big Bang Theory,38,7
5966,Penny,7, What? I'm not going to apologize to that nutcase.,2,Big Bang Theory,50,9
5967,Leonard,7," Oh, come on, it's easy, he'll even tell you what to say.",2,Big Bang Theory,57,12
5968,Penny,7," Leonard, don't you get it? If you guys keep going along with his insanity, you're just encouraging him.",2,Big Bang Theory,104,18
5969,Leonard,7, We're not encouraging. It's more like knuckling under.,2,Big Bang Theory,55,8
5970,Penny,7," Look, I like hanging out with you guys, but I'm not going to apologize for something I didn't do.",2,Big Bang Theory,98,19
5971,Leonard,7," Well, actually, technically, you did do it.",2,Big Bang Theory,44,7
5972,Penny,7," That's strike one, Leonard.",2,Big Bang Theory,28,4
5974,Penny,7," There you go, quesadilla, salad, there's your pizza, and thanks to Sheldon's heated discussion with my manager one barbecue bacon cheeseburger, barbecue sauce, bacon and cheese on the side.",2,Big Bang Theory,190,29

5980,Howard,7," Look, on the roof, Anais and Giselle are sunbathing. European-style.",2,Big Bang Theory,69,10
5981,Leonard,7, You can recognize people on Google Earth?,2,Big Bang Theory,42,7
5982,Howard,7," Of course not, I got a buddy of mine at NORAD to have a spy drone fly over.",2,Big Bang Theory,76,18
5983,Leonard,7, NORAD? You're using military aircraft?,2,Big Bang Theory,39,5
5984,Howard,7," It was already targeted to poke around a nuclear reactor in Siberia, I took it an hour out of its way, tops.",2,Big Bang Theory,109,22
5985,Penny,7," Okay, where is he?",2,Big Bang Theory,19,4
5986,Leonard,7, Sheldon? I just dropped him off at the comic book store. Why?,2,Big Bang Theory,62,12
5987,Penny,7, Here. Try and go online.,2,Big Bang Theory,25,5
5988,Leonard,7, Problem with the WiFi?,2,Big Bang Theory,23,4
5989,Penny,7," No, just try.",2,Big Bang Theory,14,3
5990,Sheldon,7," Greetings, hamburger toucher. You are probably wondering why you cannot IM with your little friends about how much you heart various things.

5991,Penny,7, Well?,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
5992,Leonard,7," I reiterate, knuckle under.",2,Big Bang Theory,28,4
5993,Penny,7," No, no, no, no, no. It is on. I am gonna introduce your friend to a world of hurt.",2,Big Bang Theory,83,19
5994,Leonard,7," Oh, Penny, you don't want to get into it with Sheldon. The guy is one lab accident away from being a supervillain.",2,Big Bang Theory,115,22
5995,Penny,7," I don't care, I was in junior rodeo, I can hogtie and castrate him in 60 seconds.",2,Big Bang Theory,82,17
5996,Howard,7," No need to neuter the nerd, I can get you back online.",2,Big Bang Theory,55,12
5997,Leonard,7," There, see? Problem solved.",2,Big Bang Theory,28,4

6005,Sheldon,7, It's Saturday night. Saturday is laundry night.,2,Big Bang Theory,48,7
6006,Sheldon,7, What are you implying?,2,Big Bang Theory,23,4
6008,Penny,7," Oh, no, are all the machines taken? What are you gonna do?",2,Big Bang Theory,59,12
6009,Sheldon,7," No problem, I'll just do my laundry another night.",2,Big Bang Theory,51,9
6010,Penny,7," Another night? Well, I guess you can try, but deep inside your heart you'll know that laundry night is always Saturday night.",2,Big Bang Theory,126,22
6011,Sheldon,7," Woman, you are playing with forces beyond your ken.",2,Big Bang Theory,52,9
6012,Penny,7," Yeah, well, your ken can kiss my Barbie.",2,Big Bang Theory,41,8
6014,Penny,7, Sheldon  Sheldon  Sheldon.,2,Big Bang Theory,27,3
6015,Sheldon,7, Yes?,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
6016,Penny,7, Where are my clothes?,2,Big Bang Theory,22,4
6017,Sheldon,7, Your clothes?,2,Big Bang Theory,14,2
6018,Penny,7," Yes, I left them in the washers and when I went down to get them, they were gone.",2,Big Bang Theory,82,18
6019,Sheldon,7, Really? Despite the sign that says â€œDo not leave laundry unattendedâ€ù?,2,Big Bang Theory,74,11
6020,Penny,7," Sheldon, where are my clothes?",2,Big Bang Theory,31,5
6021,Sheldon,7," You know, I do recall seeing some female undergarments. Where was that? Oh, yes, earlier this evening I happened to gaze out the window and a brassiere caught my eye. Do those look familiar?",2,Big Bang Theory,191,34
6022,Penny,7, How the hell did you get them up on that telephone wire?,2,Big Bang Theory,57,12
6023,Sheldon,7," When you understand the laws of physics, Penny, anything is possible. And may I add, mwah-ha-ha!",2,Big Bang Theory,97,16
6024,Penny,7, Get them down.,2,Big Bang Theory,15,3
6025,Sheldon,7, Apologize.,2,Big Bang Theory,11,1
6026,Penny,7, Never.,2,Big Bang Theory,7,1
6027,Sheldon,7," Well, then may I suggest you get a very long stick and play panty pinata.",2,Big Bang Theory,74,15
6028,Penny,7," Look, wait, Sheldon, this has gotten out of hand, okay? I've done some stupid things, you've done some stupid things, how about we just call it even and move on with our lives?",2,Big Bang Theory,177,33
6029,Sheldon,7, I've done no stupid things.,2,Big Bang Theory,28,5
6030,Penny,7," Look, you've got to meet me halfway here.",2,Big Bang Theory,42,8
6031,Sheldon,7," I am meeting you halfway, I'm willing to concede that you've done some stupid things.",2,Big Bang Theory,86,15
6032,Leonard,7," Hey, you guys are talking again. Good. What happened?",2,Big Bang Theory,54,9
6033,Penny,7," Leonard, remember when I said it was on? Well, now it's junior rodeo on.",2,Big Bang Theory,73,14
6034,Leonard,7," Oh, not junior rodeo. What did you do?",2,Big Bang Theory,39,8
6035,Sheldon,7," I had no choice, Leonard, she ruined laundry night.",2,Big Bang Theory,52,9
6036,Leonard,7, A-a-a-aw!,2,Big Bang Theory,10,1
6037,Sheldon,7, Mwah-ha-ha.,2,Big Bang Theory,12,1
6039,Penny,7," Telephone wires can't electrocute you, can they?",2,Big Bang Theory,49,7
6040,Leonard,7," No. Look, this has to stop.",2,Big Bang Theory,28,6
6041,Penny,7," Oh, no, no, no. It is just beginning.",2,Big Bang Theory,38,8
6042,Leonard,7," All right, I really didn't want to do this, but here.",2,Big Bang Theory,54,11
6043,Penny,7, What's this?,2,Big Bang Theory,13,2
6044,Leonard,7, Sheldon's Kryptonite.,2,Big Bang Theory,22,2
6045,Penny,7," Oh, my God.",2,Big Bang Theory,12,3
6046,Leonard,7, He can never know that I gave that to you.,2,Big Bang Theory,43,10
6047,Penny,7," Look, I said I wanted to hurt him, but, but this?",2,Big Bang Theory,50,11
6048,Leonard,7, It'll shorten the war by five years and save millions of lives.,2,Big Bang Theory,64,12
6050,Raj,7," Oh, pause it. That's it. Confirmed. We now have the address of the top model house.",2,Big Bang Theory,84,16
6051,Howard,7," God bless you, Google Street View registered trademark.",2,Big Bang Theory,56,8
6052,Leonard,7," Okay, for the record what you're doing is really creepy.",2,Big Bang Theory,57,10
6053,Howard,7," You know what? If it's creepy to use the Internet, military satellites, and robot aircraft to find a house full of gorgeous young models so that I can drop in on them unexpectedly, then fine, I'm creepy.",2,Big Bang Theory,204,37
6054,Leonard,7," Hello. Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. I'll get him. Sheldon, it's for you.",2,Big Bang Theory,76,15
6055,Sheldon,7, Who is it?,2,Big Bang Theory,11,3
6056,Leonard,7, Your mother.,2,Big Bang Theory,13,2
6057,Sheldon,7," Oh, good. Hi, Mom. How are you? But, Mom, she keeps sitting in my spot. And, and she touched my food. Okay, yes, I took her clothes, but she started it. No, that's not fair. Why should I have to apologize? Yeah, I really don't think this is the kind of thing Jesus concerns himself with. No, you're right, I don't really know what Jesus thinks about. All right, good-bye. Did you tell on me?",2,Big Bang Theory,392,75
6058,Leonard,7, Are you kidding me? I already have two strikes.,2,Big Bang Theory,48,9
6060,Sheldon,7,"  Penny,  Penny,  Penny  I am very, very sorry for what I have done. Here's your laundry, I rescind your strikes and you are no longer banished.",2,Big Bang Theory,144,26
6061,Penny,7," Can I sit wherever I want? No, no, never mind, never mind, that's, that's not important. Sheldon, this was big of you. Thank you. I really appreciate it.",2,Big Bang Theory,154,28
6062,Sheldon,7, Thank you.,2,Big Bang Theory,11,2
6063,Penny,7," Good night, Sheldon.",2,Big Bang Theory,21,3
6064,Sheldon,7, Penny.,2,Big Bang Theory,7,1
6065,Penny,7, Yes?,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
6066,Sheldon,7, Well played.,2,Big Bang Theory,13,2
6067,Penny,7, Thank you.,2,Big Bang Theory,11,2
6068,Penny,7, Understood.,2,Big Bang Theory,12,1
6071,Howard,7," Yes, we here to fix the cable.",2,Big Bang Theory,31,7
6073,Howard,7, That's what I meant.,2,Big Bang Theory,21,4
6075,Howard,7, She's taller than all the women in my family combined.,2,Big Bang Theory,55,10
6076,Raj,7, What do we do now?,2,Big Bang Theory,19,5
6077,Howard,7, Follow Mrs. Wolowitz.,2,Big Bang Theory,22,3
6079,Sheldon,8," Oh look, Saturn 3 is on.",2,Big Bang Theory,25,6
6080,Raj,8, I don't want to watch Saturn 3. Deep Space Nine is better.,2,Big Bang Theory,59,12
6081,Sheldon,8, How is Deep Space Nine better than Saturn 3?,2,Big Bang Theory,45,9
6082,Raj,8, Simple subtraction will tell you it's six better.,2,Big Bang Theory,50,8
6083,Leonard,8, Compromise. Watch Babylon 5.,2,Big Bang Theory,29,4
6084,Sheldon,8, In what sense is that a compromise?,2,Big Bang Theory,36,7
6085,Leonard,8," Well, five is partway between three Never mind.",2,Big Bang Theory,48,8
6086,Raj,8," I'll tell you what, how about we go rock-paper-scissors?",2,Big Bang Theory,57,9
6087,Sheldon,8," Ooh, I don't think so. No, anecdotal evidence suggests that in the game of rock-paper-scissors, players familiar with each other will tie 75 to 80% of the time due to the limited number of outcomes. I suggest rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock.",2,Big Bang Theory,244,39
6088,Raj,8, What?,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
6089,Sheldon,8," It's very simple. Look, scissors cuts paper. Paper covers rock. Rock crushes lizard. Lizard poisons Spock. Spock smashes scissors. Scissors decapitates lizard. Lizard eats paper. Paper disproves Spock. Spock vaporizes rock. And as it always has, rock crushes scissors.",2,Big Bang Theory,269,39
6090,Raj,8," Okay, I think I got it. ",2,Big Bang Theory,25,6
6092,Howard,8," Hello, boys.",2,Big Bang Theory,13,2
6093,Leonard,8," Ahoy, matey.",2,Big Bang Theory,13,2
6094,Howard,8," Noticed the eye patch, did you? It's all part of a technique I've been studying for picking up women. You employ a visual display designed to make yourself distinctive and memorable.",2,Big Bang Theory,183,31
6095,Sheldon,8," Oh yes, like the male peacock with brilliant plumage or the rutting baboon with engorged hindquarters.",2,Big Bang Theory,103,16
6096,Leonard,8," Or in this case, the bar mitzvah boy with pinkeye.",2,Big Bang Theory,51,10
6097,Howard,8," Mock me if you will, but it works. You show up at a club in something distinctive, scope out your target and toss out some negs.",2,Big Bang Theory,129,26
6098,Raj,8, What are negs?,2,Big Bang Theory,15,3
6099,Howard,8," A neg is a negative compliment that throws a pretty woman off her game, like â€œNormally, I'm not turned on by big teeth, but on you, they work.â€ù I've got a whole list of 'em. Who wants to be my wingman?",2,Big Bang Theory,206,41
6100,Leonard,8," You're not gonna need wingman, you're gonna need a paramedic.",2,Big Bang Theory,62,10
6101,Penny,8," Howard, your scooter's blocking my car. Aw, did you get pinkeye again?",2,Big Bang Theory,71,12
6102,Howard,8," Step one, she notices the eye patch. May I say, Penny, not a lot of women could look as hot as you do with such greasy hair? ",2,Big Bang Theory,126,27
6103,Penny,8," Yeah, just move your stupid scooter before I pick it up and throw it in the dumpster.",2,Big Bang Theory,86,17
6104,Howard,8, Ow.,2,Big Bang Theory,4,1
6106,Sheldon,8," I'm sorry, but I'm not going to watch the Clone Wars TV series until I've seen the Clone Wars movie. I prefer to let George Lucas disappoint me in the order he intended.",2,Big Bang Theory,170,33
6107,Leonard,8," Well, I want to watch it now.",2,Big Bang Theory,30,7
6108,Sheldon,8, Then I believe we've arrived at another quintessential rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock moment.,2,Big Bang Theory,97,11
6109,Leonard,8, Watch whatever you want.,2,Big Bang Theory,25,4
6110,Raj,8, I saw what you did there.,2,Big Bang Theory,26,6
6111,Sheldon,8, What did I do?,2,Big Bang Theory,15,4
6112,Leonard,8," Hello. Hey, Howard. What's wrong? Okay. Okay, we'll be right there.",2,Big Bang Theory,68,11
6113,Sheldon,8, What happened?,2,Big Bang Theory,15,2
6114,Leonard,8, Howard's at the Mars Rover lab. He says he's in trouble. Defcon 5.,2,Big Bang Theory,67,13
6115,Sheldon,8," Defcon 5? Well, there's no need to rush.",2,Big Bang Theory,41,8
6116,Leonard,8, What?,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
6117,Sheldon,8, Defcon 5 means no danger. Defcon 1 is a crisis.,2,Big Bang Theory,48,10
6118,Leonard,8, How can 5 not be worse than 1?,2,Big Bang Theory,31,8
6119,Raj,8," Yeah, Star Trek V, worse than I.",2,Big Bang Theory,33,7
6120,Sheldon,8," Okay, first of all, that's a comparison of quality, not intensity. Secondly, Star Trek I is orders-of-magnitude worse than Star Trek V.",2,Big Bang Theory,136,22
6121,Raj,8, Are you joking? Star Trek V is the standard against which all badness is measured.,2,Big Bang Theory,83,15
6122,Sheldon,8," No, no, no. Star Trek V has specific failures in writing and direction, while Star Trek I fails across the board, art direction, costuming, music, sound editing.",2,Big Bang Theory,162,27
6123,Leonard,8, Can we just forget I said Defcon and go?,2,Big Bang Theory,41,9
6124,Raj,8, Star Trek V!,2,Big Bang Theory,13,3
6126,Raj,8, I have three words for you. Wrath of Khan.,2,Big Bang Theory,43,9
6127,Howard,8," Oh, thank God, you're here.",2,Big Bang Theory,28,5
6128,Leonard,8, What's the emergency?,2,Big Bang Theory,22,3
6129,Howard,8, I got the Mars Rover stuck in a ditch.,2,Big Bang Theory,39,9
6130,Sheldon,8, Where?,2,Big Bang Theory,7,1
6131,Howard,8, On a dusty highway just outside Bakersfield. Where do you think? On Mars!,2,Big Bang Theory,74,13
6133,Howard,8," Yeah, baby, I'll be right in.",2,Big Bang Theory,30,6
6134,Sheldon,8, You brought a girl to the Mars Rover control room?,2,Big Bang Theory,51,10
6135,Howard,8," Yeah, I picked her up in the bar. She's a doctor. One free barium enema and my mother won't care she's not Jewish.",2,Big Bang Theory,115,23
6136,Leonard,8," Wait a minute, so the eye patch and the insults worked?",2,Big Bang Theory,56,11
6137,Howard,8," No, there were three other guys with eye patches, iIt was a fiasco. What did work was, â€œHow'd you like to visit a secret government facility?â€ù",2,Big Bang Theory,147,26
6138,Sheldon,8, So what exactly do you want us to do?,2,Big Bang Theory,38,9
6139,Howard,8," I need you and Raj to help me get the Rover out of the ditch, and I need you to get Stephanie out before somebody notices she's here. She doesn't exactly have clearance.",2,Big Bang Theory,170,33
6140,Sheldon,8, Really? They don't let strange women from honky-tonks come in and play with $200million government projects on distant planets?,2,Big Bang Theory,128,19
6141,Howard,8," Yes, I was bad. Maybe she'll spank me. Can we please move on?",2,Big Bang Theory,62,13
6143,Howard,8," Yeah. No. I'm sorry, but something's come up. Kind of a Mars Rover, Mars Rover, can Howard come over, situation. So my friend Leonard is gonna take you home.",2,Big Bang Theory,158,29
6145,Leonard,8, Okay.,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
6146,Howard,8, I'll call ya.,2,Big Bang Theory,14,3
6148,Leonard,8, No one's a scientist like Howard.,2,Big Bang Theory,34,6
6149,Howard,8, My mother is so gonna love her.,2,Big Bang Theory,32,7
6150,Sheldon,8," Oh, how nice. Maybe they can carpool when they visit you in federal prison.",2,Big Bang Theory,76,14
6153,Leonard,8," Just said Howard's a terrific guy. He's got a great sense of humour, he loves his mother, a lot, some people say too much.",2,Big Bang Theory,123,24
6155,Leonard,8," Yeah, I am loyal. You know, if you look at the big picture. Just, out of curiosity, did he ever have a shot with you?",2,Big Bang Theory,118,25
6157,Leonard,8, Then why did you?,2,Big Bang Theory,18,4
6159,Leonard,8," Got it. So, can I see you again?",2,Big Bang Theory,33,8
6161,Leonard,8, Ooh. Cool.,2,Big Bang Theory,11,2
6163,Howard,8, Anything?,2,Big Bang Theory,10,1
6164,Raj,8," Actually, I was just checking my e-mail. But, uh, no, the Rover is not responding.",2,Big Bang Theory,83,15
6165,Sheldon,8, I believe the appropriate metaphor here involves a river of excrement and a Native American water vessel without any means of propulsion.,2,Big Bang Theory,138,22
6166,Howard,8," Hang on, there's got to be other options.",2,Big Bang Theory,42,8
6167,Raj,8," You could try calling Triple-A, but based on NASA's latest timetable, they won't get there for 35 years.",2,Big Bang Theory,105,18
6168,Sheldon,8, Plus I understand you have to be standing next to the vehicle with your card when they arrive.,2,Big Bang Theory,95,18
6169,Raj,8," Oh, snap.",2,Big Bang Theory,10,2
6170,Sheldon,8, Snap what?,2,Big Bang Theory,11,2
6171,Howard,8," OK, I guess we have to turn to Plan B.",2,Big Bang Theory,39,10
6172,Raj,8, What's Plan B?,2,Big Bang Theory,15,3
6173,Howard,8," Erase all the hard drives, scrap the surveillance tapes, wipe our fingerprints off every surface and run.",2,Big Bang Theory,106,17
6174,Sheldon,8, Why wasn't that Plan A?,2,Big Bang Theory,24,5
6176,Howard,8, Thank God for Plan B.,2,Big Bang Theory,22,5
6177,Penny,8," Howard, didn't you say you worked on the Mars Rover?",2,Big Bang Theory,53,10
6178,Howard,8," No, you're mistaken.",2,Big Bang Theory,21,3
6179,Penny,8," Yeah, when we first met, you said that if I went out with you, I could drive a car on Mars.",2,Big Bang Theory,92,21
6180,Howard,8, I don't know what you're talking about.,2,Big Bang Theory,40,7
6181,Leonard,8, Psst! Psst!,2,Big Bang Theory,12,2
6182,Sheldon,8, Will you all excuse me? Leonard is subtly signalling that he'd like to talk to me in private.,2,Big Bang Theory,94,18
6183,Penny,8," No. Yeah, I remember specifically. You started by asking if I was from Mars because my ass was out of this world.",2,Big Bang Theory,114,22
6184,Howard,8," Well, that does sound like me, but no.",2,Big Bang Theory,39,8
6185,Sheldon,8, Is there some problem?,2,Big Bang Theory,23,4
6186,Leonard,8," Yeah. Listen, I have to kinda sneak out for a while.",2,Big Bang Theory,53,11
6187,Sheldon,8," All right, goodbye.",2,Big Bang Theory,20,3
6188,Leonard,8," No, wait! If anyone asks you where I went, you don't know.",2,Big Bang Theory,59,12
6189,Sheldon,8, Where are you going?,2,Big Bang Theory,21,4
6190,Leonard,8, I can't tell you that.,2,Big Bang Theory,23,5
6191,Sheldon,8, Who would ask me?,2,Big Bang Theory,18,4
6192,Leonard,8," I can't tell you that, either.",2,Big Bang Theory,31,6
6193,Sheldon,8, So you brought me in here to inform me that you can't tell me where you're going and you can't tell me who might ask?,2,Big Bang Theory,118,25
6194,Leonard,8," Yeah, I really didn't think this through.",2,Big Bang Theory,42,7
6195,Sheldon,8," Leonard, a moment.",2,Big Bang Theory,19,3
6196,Leonard,8, What?,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
6197,Sheldon,8," If someone, and of course, we don't know who this would be, does ask where you've gone, what should I say?",2,Big Bang Theory,107,21
6198,Leonard,8, I don't know. Just tell them I went to the office.,2,Big Bang Theory,51,11
6199,Sheldon,8, Are you going to the office?,2,Big Bang Theory,29,6
6200,Leonard,8, No.,2,Big Bang Theory,4,1
6201,Sheldon,8, Then how can I say it convincingly?,2,Big Bang Theory,36,7
6202,Leonard,8," Just say, Leonard went to the office.",2,Big Bang Theory,38,7
6203,Sheldon,8, All right. Leonard went to  the office.,2,Big Bang Theory,40,7
6204,Leonard,8," What is? No, not like that! Just, Leonard went to the office.",2,Big Bang Theory,62,12
6205,Sheldon,8, This would have worked out a lot better if you'd just told me you were going the office.,2,Big Bang Theory,89,18
6206,Leonard,8, I'm going to the office.,2,Big Bang Theory,25,5
6207,Sheldon,8, See? Why don't I believe you?,2,Big Bang Theory,30,6
6208,Leonard,8, I'm going out for a while.,2,Big Bang Theory,27,6
6209,Howard,8, Okay.,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
6210,Sheldon,8, Doesn't anyone want to know where he's going?,2,Big Bang Theory,46,8
6211,Penny,8," Okay, where is he going?",2,Big Bang Theory,25,5
6212,Sheldon,8, Leonard is going to  the office.,2,Big Bang Theory,33,6
6214,Leonard,8, So how was work today?,2,Big Bang Theory,23,5
6216,Leonard,8, I'm hoping that's three different guys.,2,Big Bang Theory,40,6
6218,Leonard,8," Oh, you know, I'm a physicist, so, I thought about stuff.",2,Big Bang Theory,58,11
6220,Leonard,8," Well, I wrote some of it down.",2,Big Bang Theory,31,7
6222,Leonard,8," Uh, yeah.",2,Big Bang Theory,10,2
6224,Leonard,8," If I knew you were waiting, I would've swallowed that lasagna whole.",2,Big Bang Theory,69,12
6226,Howard,8," Hey, Steph, it's me again, Howard. Listen, if you're free Friday, maybe we could have a little something to eat at my place. My mom cooks a hell of a brisket. Let me know. It's Howard.",2,Big Bang Theory,185,36
6227,Leonard,8, I've had her brisket. Melts in your mouth.,2,Big Bang Theory,43,8
6229,Leonard,8," That's a good idea. There's a bed in there, and I'm very, very, very pro-bed.",2,Big Bang Theory,78,15
6231,Howard,8," Hey, it's me again. Just want to let you know the head count for dinner Friday has gone up. My Aunt Betty and Uncle Elliot are coming in from Palm Springs. Oh, and if anybody should ask, you're half-Jewish on your mother's side. Okay, call me. It's Howard.",2,Big Bang Theory,257,48
6232,Leonard,8, Don't you think we should tell him you're not interested?,2,Big Bang Theory,58,10
6234,Leonard,8," Dear God, no!",2,Big Bang Theory,14,3
6237,Howard,8," Hey, it's me again. Howard. Listen, my cousins from Fort Lauderdale are flying in to meet you so that means we're gonna have to move the dinner to a restaurant.",2,Big Bang Theory,161,30
6239,Howard,8," We're not going to the Olive Garden, Mom!",2,Big Bang Theory,42,8
6241,Howard,8, I'll call you back when we firm up the details. It's Howard.,2,Big Bang Theory,61,12
6243,Penny,8," Oh, hey.",2,Big Bang Theory,9,2
6244,Leonard,8, Hey.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
6245,Penny,8, New shirts?,2,Big Bang Theory,12,2
6246,Leonard,8," Yeah, a couple.",2,Big Bang Theory,16,3
6247,Penny,8, Nice.,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
6248,Leonard,8, Thank you.,2,Big Bang Theory,11,2
6249,Penny,8," So, who's the girl?",2,Big Bang Theory,20,4
6250,Leonard,8, I'm sorry?,2,Big Bang Theory,11,2
6251,Penny,8," Well, last time you bought a new shirt was when we were dating.",2,Big Bang Theory,64,13
6252,Leonard,8," So, uh, what we did was in fact dating?",2,Big Bang Theory,40,9
6253,Penny,8," Well, yeah, we did have a date.",2,Big Bang Theory,32,7
6254,Leonard,8," Exactly. Thank you. Do me a favour, tell Koothrappali that next time you see him.",2,Big Bang Theory,82,15
6255,Penny,8," So, who is she?",2,Big Bang Theory,16,4
6256,Leonard,8," Oh, she's a doctor.",2,Big Bang Theory,20,4
6257,Penny,8," Oh, nice. A doctor doctor, or a you kind of doctor?",2,Big Bang Theory,52,11
6258,Leonard,8," Doctor doctor. Surgical resident. Smart, pretty. Let me ask you something. If your friend thinks he's dating someone, but he's not because, in fact, you're dating her, does that make you a bad person?",2,Big Bang Theory,201,34
6259,Penny,8," Well, that depends.",2,Big Bang Theory,20,3
6260,Leonard,8, On what?,2,Big Bang Theory,9,2
6261,Penny,8, Is that friend Wolowitz?,2,Big Bang Theory,25,4
6262,Leonard,8, Yeah.,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
6263,Penny,8, Screw him. You're fine.,2,Big Bang Theory,24,4
6264,Leonard,8, Are you sure?,2,Big Bang Theory,14,3
6265,Penny,8," Well, have you slept with her yet? You dog! Good for you.",2,Big Bang Theory,58,12
6266,Leonard,8, Does that change things?,2,Big Bang Theory,25,4
6267,Penny,8, No.,2,Big Bang Theory,4,1
6268,Leonard,8, So why'd you ask?,2,Big Bang Theory,18,4
6269,Penny,8, I'm nosy. See ya.,2,Big Bang Theory,18,4
6272,Howard,8," Really? Is that what you do when someone knocks? Thank you. I had no idea!  Hey, buddy. What brings you to my little slice of hell?",2,Big Bang Theory,132,26
6274,Howard,8, It's Leonard!,2,Big Bang Theory,14,2
6276,Howard,8," No one cares, Ma! So, what's up?",2,Big Bang Theory,33,7
6277,Leonard,8," Listen, I need to talk to you about something.",2,Big Bang Theory,47,9
6278,Howard,8," Momentito. Yello. Oh, Stephanie, thanks for calling me back. I was worried Oh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh No, I understand Sure, we can be friends. Absolutely. Thanks for calling. Yeah, you have a nice day, too.  You are dead to me.",2,Big Bang Theory,226,40
6280,Raj,8," Okay, who gets the extra dumpling?",2,Big Bang Theory,35,6
6282,Sheldon,8," Okay, one of us is going to have to stop putting up Spock.",2,Big Bang Theory,59,13
6283,Howard,8, How do we decide that?,2,Big Bang Theory,23,5
6285,Leonard,8," Oh, hey, guys.",2,Big Bang Theory,15,3
6286,Sheldon,8, Hello.,2,Big Bang Theory,7,1
6287,Raj,8, Hey.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
6288,Leonard,8," Hi, Howard. Howard?",2,Big Bang Theory,20,3
6289,Howard,8, Sheldon.,2,Big Bang Theory,9,1
6290,Sheldon,8," Howard is employing a schoolyard paradigm in which you are, for all intents and purposes, deceased. He intends to act on this by not speaking to you, feigning an inability to hear you when you speak and otherwise refusing to acknowledge your existence.",2,Big Bang Theory,253,43
6291,Leonard,8, That's just ridiculous. Why are you cooperating with him?,2,Big Bang Theory,58,9
6292,Sheldon,8," I don't make the rules, Leonard.",2,Big Bang Theory,33,6
6293,Leonard,8," Howard, come on, I didn't plan on this. These things just happen. Usually not to me, but they do happen.",2,Big Bang Theory,105,20
6294,Howard,8, Did someone just feel a cold breeze?,2,Big Bang Theory,37,7
6295,Sheldon,8, I believe this is an extension of the death metaphor. The cold breeze is the so-called ectoplasmic issue of a disembodied soul passing by.,2,Big Bang Theory,139,24
6296,Raj,8," You know, screw it, I'm just gonna eat the dumpling.",2,Big Bang Theory,53,10
6297,Leonard,8," Oh, hi, Steph, come on in.",2,Big Bang Theory,27,6
6299,Leonard,8," Yeah, but I don't see a better one on the horizon, so",2,Big Bang Theory,54,12
6300,Howard,8," Oh, if it isn't Mrs. Dead to Me.",2,Big Bang Theory,33,8
6302,Howard,8, Sheldon?,2,Big Bang Theory,9,1
6303,Sheldon,8," Look I'm sorry, you violated the terms of your metaphor by acknowledging her existence. I'm out.",2,Big Bang Theory,97,16
6304,Leonard,8, He just won't listen to me.,2,Big Bang Theory,28,6
6306,Leonard,8, Hmm. Lisa's gonna be disappointed.,2,Big Bang Theory,35,5
6308,Howard,8, Lisa?,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
6310,Howard,8," Leonard, Stephanie, you're alive, it's a miracle!",2,Big Bang Theory,50,7
6312,Howard,8," So, anyway, Lisa, I just wanted to tell you again how much I enjoyed the other night, and again, I'm sorry for how it ended. But again, if you could let me know about Friday. My mother needs a head count so she can know how big a brisket to get.",2,Big Bang Theory,246,51
6313,Leonard,8," Howard, Howard, look at this.",2,Big Bang Theory,30,5
6314,Howard,8," Anyway, call me. It's Howard.",2,Big Bang Theory,30,5
6316,Howard,8, Son of a bitch.,2,Big Bang Theory,16,4
6318,Sheldon,9," Penny, hello.",2,Big Bang Theory,14,2
6319,Penny,9," Hey, Sheldon.",2,Big Bang Theory,14,2
6320,Sheldon,9, What is shaking?,2,Big Bang Theory,17,3
6321,Penny,9, I'm sorry?,2,Big Bang Theory,11,2
6322,Sheldon,9," It's colloquial, a conversation opener. So, do you find the weather satisfying? Are you currently sharing in the triumph of some local sports team?",2,Big Bang Theory,148,24
6323,Penny,9, What's wrong with you? you're freaking me out.,2,Big Bang Theory,47,8
6324,Sheldon,9, I'm striking up a casual conversation with you. S'u'up?,2,Big Bang Theory,56,9
6325,Penny,9, Please don't do that.,2,Big Bang Theory,22,4
6326,Sheldon,9," All right, But I'm given to understand that when you have something awkward to discuss with someone, it's more palatable to preface it with banal chit chat.",2,Big Bang Theory,157,27
6327,Penny,9," So, this wasn't the awkward part?",2,Big Bang Theory,34,6
6328,Sheldon,9, No.,2,Big Bang Theory,4,1
6329,Penny,9," Oh, all right. S'u'up?",2,Big Bang Theory,23,4
6330,Sheldon,9," Oh, good, I used that right. Anyway, you're aware that Leonard has entered into a new romantic relationship which includes a sexual component?",2,Big Bang Theory,143,23
6331,Penny,9," Okay, feeling the awkward now.",2,Big Bang Theory,31,5
6332,Sheldon,9, Her name is Dr. Stephanie Barnett and she is a highly distinguished surgical resident at Freemont Memorial.,2,Big Bang Theory,108,17
6333,Penny,9," Yeah, Leonard told me.",2,Big Bang Theory,23,4
6334,Sheldon,9, Good. What he may have left out is how important this relationship is to me.,2,Big Bang Theory,77,15
6335,Penny,9, To you?,2,Big Bang Theory,8,2
6336,Sheldon,9," Yes, see, of the handful of women Leonard's been involved with, she's the only one I have ever found tolerable.",2,Big Bang Theory,112,20
6337,Penny,9," Well, what about me?",2,Big Bang Theory,21,4
6338,Sheldon,9, The statement stands for itself.,2,Big Bang Theory,33,5
6339,Penny,9," Well, aren't you sweet?",2,Big Bang Theory,24,4
6340,Sheldon,9," Anyway, should you have any interaction with her, it would be most helpful that she not see you as a sexual rival.",2,Big Bang Theory,115,22
6341,Penny,9," Yeah, I think she's pretty safe.",2,Big Bang Theory,33,6
6342,Sheldon,9," You say that now, but consider the following scenario, you're sitting in your apartment, it's late, you're alone, your hypothalamus is swimming in a soup of estrogen and progesterone and suddenly even Leonard seems like a viable sexual candidate, or a, uh, hookup as it's referred to by today's urban youth.",2,Big Bang Theory,308,51
6343,Penny,9, Really?,2,Big Bang Theory,8,1
6344,Sheldon,9," Yes. Now, should that happen, I would ask you to find some way to suppress your libido.",2,Big Bang Theory,88,17
6345,Penny,9, I could think about you.,2,Big Bang Theory,25,5
6346,Sheldon,9," Fine, whatever works.",2,Big Bang Theory,22,3
6347,Penny,9," Always nice talking to you, Sheldon.",2,Big Bang Theory,37,6
6348,Sheldon,9," Uh, peace out!",2,Big Bang Theory,15,3
6350,Sheldon,9," Well, this is very pleasant.",2,Big Bang Theory,29,5
6351,Leonard,9, I'm glad you're enjoying yourself.,2,Big Bang Theory,35,5
6352,Sheldon,9, And you said there'd never be enough pasta for the three of us.,2,Big Bang Theory,64,13
6353,Leonard,9, I stand corrected.,2,Big Bang Theory,19,3
6354,Sheldon,9," You know, Italian housewives have a rule of thumb. A handful of dry pasta about an inch in diameter is sufficient for each person as it doubles in volume when cooked.",2,Big Bang Theory,167,31
6356,Sheldon,9, Thank you.,2,Big Bang Theory,11,2
6357,Leonard,9, She doesn't mean it. She's just being nice.,2,Big Bang Theory,44,8
6358,Sheldon,9," Well, Stephanie, since Leonard seems to be dropping the conversational ball, I guess I'll just have to pick it up. Have you ever witnessed a violent crime?",2,Big Bang Theory,156,27
6360,Sheldon,9, Good. What's your favourite fruit?,2,Big Bang Theory,35,5
6362,Sheldon,9," Hmm, technically not a fruit, but all right. Where did you do your medical internship?",2,Big Bang Theory,87,15
6364,Sheldon,9, Really? That's where I was born!,2,Big Bang Theory,33,6
6366,Sheldon,9," I spent so much of my childhood at that hospital. When I was 12, I got to ride there in a helicopter.",2,Big Bang Theory,102,22
6368,Sheldon,9, Radiation burns. A little mishap while I was building my own cat scanner.,2,Big Bang Theory,74,13
6370,Sheldon,9," No, I didn't try, I succeeded. In fact, I was briefly able to see the inside of my sister's guinea pig, Snowball, before he caught fire. It led to an interesting expression in our house, not a snowball's chance in a cat scanner.",2,Big Bang Theory,229,43
6371,Leonard,9," Uh, Sheldon?",2,Big Bang Theory,13,2
6372,Sheldon,9," Excuse me. When I come back, just for fun, the subject will be alternative history. Specifically, how would the civil war have gone differently if Lincoln had been a robot sent from the future?  Look at that, there's even pasta left over.",2,Big Bang Theory,239,42
6373,Leonard,9, Do you understand that this was supposed to be a date?,2,Big Bang Theory,55,11
6374,Sheldon,9," I do. Do you? Because frankly, you've been in a foul mood since I sat down.",2,Big Bang Theory,76,16
6375,Leonard,9," Okay, here's my question, why did you sit down?",2,Big Bang Theory,48,9
6376,Sheldon,9," To help. Look, if you fail at this relationship, and history suggests you will, then we risk losing the medical officer that our landing party has always needed.",2,Big Bang Theory,162,28
6377,Leonard,9, What landing party?,2,Big Bang Theory,20,3
6378,Sheldon,9," You're Kirk, I'm Spock, Wolowitz is Scotty, Koothrappali is the guy who always gets killed, and now we've got McCoy.",2,Big Bang Theory,117,20
6381,Leonard,9," Oh, my god, what did you do?",2,Big Bang Theory,29,7
6383,Sheldon,9," I have a bone to pick with you, sir.",2,Big Bang Theory,37,9
6384,Leonard,9, Oo-oo-oh!,2,Big Bang Theory,10,1
6386,Sheldon,9," Hi, Stephanie. I'm sorry I'm late, but your companion left the most indecipherable invitation.",2,Big Bang Theory,95,14
6387,Leonard,9, What invitation?,2,Big Bang Theory,17,2
6388,Sheldon,9," We're going to the movies. What movie? What theatre? What time? If you were trying to make it impossible to locate you, you couldn't have done a better job.",2,Big Bang Theory,157,29
6389,Leonard,9," Oh, clearly I could have.",2,Big Bang Theory,26,5
6390,Sheldon,9," It took me nearly 20 minutes to go through the browser history on your computer to see what movie times you looked up. Wait here, I'll find us seats.",2,Big Bang Theory,150,29
6392,Leonard,9, Not the right seats. ,2,Big Bang Theory,22,4
6394,Leonard,9, He's finding the acoustic sweet spot.,2,Big Bang Theory,38,6
6396,Leonard,9, Sometimes he brings a toy xylophone. I am really sorry about this.,2,Big Bang Theory,67,12
6398,Sheldon,9," My apologies, you've been sitting in it all along. Leonard, you want to slide over one?",2,Big Bang Theory,88,16
6399,Leonard,9," No, just sit here.",2,Big Bang Theory,19,4
6400,Sheldon,9," Oh, yeah, this is it.",2,Big Bang Theory,22,5
6403,Leonard,9," What, Sheldon? What, Sheldon? What, Sheldon?",2,Big Bang Theory,45,6
6404,Sheldon,9, Tell me what you see here.,2,Big Bang Theory,27,6
6405,Leonard,9, The blunt instrument that will be the focus of my murder trial?,2,Big Bang Theory,64,12
6406,Sheldon,9," This is Stephanie's facebook page. Now, where it should say in a relationship, what does it say?",2,Big Bang Theory,97,17
6407,Leonard,9, Stephanie Barnett is single.,2,Big Bang Theory,29,4
6408,Sheldon,9," Yeah, furthermore, earlier this evening, she threw a digital sheep at some guy named Mike. Who's Mike? Why does he get a digital sheep and not you?",2,Big Bang Theory,148,27
6409,Leonard,9, It's just her facebook page and we've only been going out a couple of weeks.,2,Big Bang Theory,77,15
6410,Sheldon,9," You don't see it, do you? We're losing her.",2,Big Bang Theory,44,9
6411,Leonard,9," Okay, I'm going to make this very simple for you. You are not in this relationship, I am. Ergo, you have no say in anything that happens between me and Stephanie.",2,Big Bang Theory,163,31
6412,Sheldon,9," I'm afraid I can't allow that. Pursuant to Starfleet General Order 104 Section A, you are deemed unfit and I hereby relieve you of your command.",2,Big Bang Theory,145,26
6413,Leonard,9," General Order 104, Section A does not apply in this situation.",2,Big Bang Theory,63,11
6414,Sheldon,9, Give me one good reason why not.,2,Big Bang Theory,33,7
6415,Leonard,9, Because this is not Star Trek,2,Big Bang Theory,30,6
6418,Penny,9, What?,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
6419,Sheldon,9, This is banana bread.,2,Big Bang Theory,22,4
6420,Penny,9, This is a door knob.,2,Big Bang Theory,21,5
6421,Sheldon,9, It's my understanding that an unsolicited gift of food can be a precursor to an impromptu invitation to come in and chat.,2,Big Bang Theory,122,22
6422,Penny,9," Sheldon, would you like to come in?",2,Big Bang Theory,36,7
6423,Sheldon,9, I suppose I could spare a few minutes. Were you robbed?,2,Big Bang Theory,56,11
6424,Penny,9, No.,2,Big Bang Theory,4,1
6425,Sheldon,9, How can you be sure?,2,Big Bang Theory,21,5
6426,Penny,9," Sheldon, what do you want?",2,Big Bang Theory,27,5
6427,Sheldon,9," I'm certain this will come as no surprise to you, but Leonard is failing in yet another relationship.",2,Big Bang Theory,102,18
6428,Penny,9, He's having problems with Stephanie?,2,Big Bang Theory,37,5
6429,Sheldon,9," She's sending virtual livestock to random men on the internet. If I have any hope of keeping them together, I need data. Specifically, I need to know exactly what Leonard did that caused you to pop an emotional cap in his buttocks.",2,Big Bang Theory,232,42
6430,Penny,9, What?,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
6431,Sheldon,9," Again, urban slang. In which, I believe I'm gaining remarkable fluency. So, what is the down and the low? And don't worry, this is all entirely confidential, so, you feel free to include any and all shortcomings in the bedroom.",2,Big Bang Theory,228,40
6432,Penny,9, We never got to the bedroom.,2,Big Bang Theory,29,6
6433,Sheldon,9, Because?,2,Big Bang Theory,9,1
6434,Penny,9," Oh, okay, all right, you know what? I'll tell you what happened. We were young, we were very much in love, but we could only communicate through a time-traveling mailbox at my lake house.",2,Big Bang Theory,188,34
6435,Sheldon,9," It's not enough that you made me watch that movie, but now you mock me with it?",2,Big Bang Theory,80,17
6437,Sheldon,9," Gentlemen, I have a question about dating and relationships.",2,Big Bang Theory,61,9
6438,Raj,9, You told me you were going to have the talk with him.,2,Big Bang Theory,54,12
6439,Howard,9, I've been waiting for someone to have the talk with me.,2,Big Bang Theory,56,11
6440,Sheldon,9," More to the point, it's about finding a way to keep Leonard and Stephanie together.",2,Big Bang Theory,84,15
6441,Howard,9," Oh, I don't think you can.",2,Big Bang Theory,27,6
6442,Sheldon,9," Well, why not?",2,Big Bang Theory,15,3
6443,Howard,9, Look at Leonard's record. 27 days with Joyce Kim.,2,Big Bang Theory,50,9
6444,Raj,9, During which she defected to North Korea.,2,Big Bang Theory,42,7
6445,Howard,9, Two booty calls with Leslie Winkle.,2,Big Bang Theory,36,6
6446,Raj,9, For which she awarded him the nickname â€œspeed of light Leonard.â€ù,2,Big Bang Theory,69,11
6447,Howard,9, And a three hour dinner with Penny.,2,Big Bang Theory,36,7
6448,Raj,9, Which would have been two and a half if they ordered the souffle when they sat down.,2,Big Bang Theory,85,17
6449,Howard,9," Based on the geometric progression, his relationship with Stephanie should have ended after 20 minutes.",2,Big Bang Theory,104,15
6450,Sheldon,9," Yes, I'm aware of the math, Y equals 27 days over 12 to the nth, the issue remains, how do we circumvent his inevitable rejection?",2,Big Bang Theory,131,25
6451,Raj,9," Well, if you want to guarantee his appeal to Stephanie, your best bet would be to kill all the other men on the planet.",2,Big Bang Theory,120,24
6452,Howard,9," I'll tell you what you shouldn't do. Don't spritz him with that body spray from the commercial where the women undress when they smell it, that doesn't work at all, no matter how much you put on.",2,Big Bang Theory,196,37
6453,Sheldon,9," So, that's all you've got? Apocalyptic genocide and go easy on the cologne?",2,Big Bang Theory,76,13
6454,Howard,9, Yes.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
6455,Raj,9, Yeah.,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
6458,Penny,9, What?,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
6460,Penny,9," Oh, thank you.",2,Big Bang Theory,15,3
6461,Sheldon,9, May I come in?,2,Big Bang Theory,15,4
6462,Penny,9, No.,2,Big Bang Theory,4,1
6463,Sheldon,9, I see. Apparently my earlier inquiry regarding you and Leonard crossed some sort of line. I apologize.,2,Big Bang Theory,103,17
6464,Penny,9," Well, thank you.",2,Big Bang Theory,17,3
6465,Sheldon,9," So, have you and I returned to a social equilibrium?",2,Big Bang Theory,53,10
6466,Penny,9, Yes.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
6467,Sheldon,9, Great. New topic. Where are you in your menstrual cycle?,2,Big Bang Theory,57,10
6468,Penny,9, What?,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
6469,Sheldon,9," I've been doing some research online, and apparently female primates, you know, uh, apes, chimpanzees, you, they find their mate more desirable when he's being courted by another female. Now, this effect is intensified when the rival female is secreting the pheromones associated with ovulation. Which brings me back to my question, where are you in . Clearly, I'm 14 days too early.",2,Big Bang Theory,384,63
6471,Leonard,9," All I'm saying is if they can cure yellow fever and malaria, why can't they do something about lactose intolerance?",2,Big Bang Theory,116,20
6473,Sheldon,9," Oh, hi Stephanie.",2,Big Bang Theory,18,3
6475,Leonard,9, Want some more wine?,2,Big Bang Theory,21,4
6477,Leonard,9, What are you doing?,2,Big Bang Theory,20,4
6478,Sheldon,9, I have a craving for white asparagus that apparently is destined to go unsatisfied.,2,Big Bang Theory,84,14
6479,Leonard,9, Excuse me. What the hell is wrong with you?,2,Big Bang Theory,44,9
6480,Sheldon,9, I'm helping you with Stephanie.,2,Big Bang Theory,32,5
6481,Leonard,9, By making constipated moose sounds?,2,Big Bang Theory,36,5
6482,Sheldon,9," When I fail to open this jar and you succeed it will establish you as the alpha male. You see, when a female witnesses an exhibition of physical domination she produces the hormone oxytocin. If the two of you then engage in intercourse this will create the biochemical reaction in the brain which lay people naively interpret as falling in love.",2,Big Bang Theory,346,61
6483,Leonard,9, Huh? Would it work if I just punched you in the face?,2,Big Bang Theory,54,12
6484,Sheldon,9," Yes, actually it would, but let's see how the lid goes. I'm not strong enough, Leonard, you'll have to do it.",2,Big Bang Theory,110,21
6485,Leonard,9," Oh, for god's sakes.",2,Big Bang Theory,21,4
6486,Sheldon,9," Go ahead, it's pre-loosened.",2,Big Bang Theory,29,4
6488,Leonard,9," No, no, no, I got it.",2,Big Bang Theory,22,6
6489,Sheldon,9," No, yeah, yeah, he's got it, and that's not surprising. This is something I long ago came to peace with in my role as the beta male. Open it. ",2,Big Bang Theory,143,29
6491,Leonard,9," No, I'm not. I'm bleeding.",2,Big Bang Theory,27,5
6492,Sheldon,9, Like a gladiator!,2,Big Bang Theory,18,3
6494,Leonard,9, Stitches? With a needle?,2,Big Bang Theory,25,4
6496,Leonard,9," Oh, okay, yeah, hang on a sec. ",2,Big Bang Theory,32,7
6497,Sheldon,9," FYI, I was defrosting a steak in there.",2,Big Bang Theory,40,8
6499,Sheldon,9," What a beautiful job Stephanie did. I might have gone with a mattress suture instead of a blanket stitch, but you can't argue with her results. It's a shame it won't scar, the war wound is a time-honoured badge of masculinity.",2,Big Bang Theory,227,41
6500,Leonard,9, I can't remember a time when you weren't talking.,2,Big Bang Theory,50,9
6501,Sheldon,9," Just for the record, my efforts to establish you as the alpha male were not aided by you bursting into tears.",2,Big Bang Theory,110,21
6502,Leonard,9," I did not burst into tears, my eyes just got a little watery.",2,Big Bang Theory,62,13
6503,Sheldon,9, Watery?,2,Big Bang Theory,8,1
6504,Leonard,9, She stuck a needle into my hand!,2,Big Bang Theory,33,7
6506,Leonard,9, I didn't cry.,2,Big Bang Theory,14,3
6508,Leonard,9," Oh, are you still going to spend the night?",2,Big Bang Theory,44,9
6510,Sheldon,9," She's right, as long as you're vomiting, coitus is contra-indicated.",2,Big Bang Theory,69,10
6511,Leonard,9," Thank you, Dr. Cooper.",2,Big Bang Theory,23,4
6512,Sheldon,9," You're welcome, Dr. Hofstadter.",2,Big Bang Theory,32,4
6514,Leonard,9, What?,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
6515,Sheldon,9," Well, you seem like a perfectly pleasant person. I just can't understand why women have such a hard time loving you.",2,Big Bang Theory,117,21
6517,Leonard,9," Hey, can you open this for me?",2,Big Bang Theory,31,7
6518,Raj,9, Can I see your stitches?,2,Big Bang Theory,25,5
6519,Leonard,9, Sure. .,2,Big Bang Theory,8,2
6520,Raj,9, Answering the question once and for all why Wolowitz bailed out of medical school.,2,Big Bang Theory,83,14
6521,Penny,9," Leonard, congratulations.",2,Big Bang Theory,26,2
6522,Leonard,9, What for?,2,Big Bang Theory,10,2
6523,Penny,9, Your facebook status update. Leonard Hofstadter is in a relationship.,2,Big Bang Theory,70,10
6524,Leonard,9," What? no. no, that's not right.",2,Big Bang Theory,32,6
6525,Howard,9," Oh, man, did you switch your status before she did? Speaking as an expert, way to look needy.",2,Big Bang Theory,94,18
6526,Penny,9," Seriously? You went first, after only two weeks? That's bold.",2,Big Bang Theory,62,10
6527,Leonard,9," It's not bold, it's a mistake. I didn't change my status.",2,Big Bang Theory,58,11
6528,Penny,9," Well, then who did?",2,Big Bang Theory,20,4
6529,Sheldon,9," I had no choice, he cried in front of her.",2,Big Bang Theory,43,10
6530,Leonard,9, You hacked my facebook account?,2,Big Bang Theory,32,5
6531,Sheldon,9," Oh, it's hardly hacking when you use the same password for everything, Kal-el.",2,Big Bang Theory,79,13
6532,Leonard,9, Are you insane? Now she's going to think I'm desperate. You've destroyed this relationship! And you want to know what the worst part is? You don't even understand what you did wrong because you can't conceive of something that you are not an expert in!,2,Big Bang Theory,253,45
6533,Sheldon,9, In which I am not an expert.,2,Big Bang Theory,29,7
6534,Leonard,9, Don't even! I don't want to hear another word out of you.,2,Big Bang Theory,58,12
6535,Penny,9," What's wrong, Lassie? Timmy fall down the well?  Oh, wow. She just updated her facebook status.",2,Big Bang Theory,96,16
6536,Howard,9, Stephanie Barnett is in a relationship with Leonard Hofstadter.â€ù,2,Big Bang Theory,67,9
6537,Leonard,9," Really? Oh, look at that, I have a girlfriend.",2,Big Bang Theory,47,9
6538,Sheldon,9," If I am permitted to speak again, Dr. Sheldon Cooper for the win.",2,Big Bang Theory,66,13
6541,Sheldon,10," Well, you're the doctor, but I am constantly hearing this annoying sound.",2,Big Bang Theory,74,12
6542,Leonard,10," Me, too.",2,Big Bang Theory,9,2
6543,Sheldon,10, Is it a high-frequency whistle?,2,Big Bang Theory,32,5
6544,Leonard,10," No, it's more of a relentless, narcissistic drone.",2,Big Bang Theory,51,8
6546,Sheldon,10, Then it must be a tumour.,2,Big Bang Theory,26,6
6548,Leonard,10, Maybe it's a lingering bacterial infection from all those childhood toilet swirlies.,2,Big Bang Theory,85,12
6549,Sheldon,10, Is that possible? I used to get those all the time. Even in church.,2,Big Bang Theory,68,14
6551,Leonard,10," Okay, I'll be right in.",2,Big Bang Theory,24,5
6552,Sheldon,10," It's not enough that she mocks me, but that isn't even the correct procedure for a cootie shot.",2,Big Bang Theory,96,18
6553,Leonard,10, Do you understand that Stephanie's not here to treat your imaginary ailments?,2,Big Bang Theory,78,12
6554,Sheldon,10, How is it imaginary that I keep hearing an octave above Middle C? Is that imaginary? I don't think so.,2,Big Bang Theory,103,20
6555,Leonard,10, Good night.,2,Big Bang Theory,12,2
6556,Sheldon,10," Leonard, there's one more thing. Under Article One, Section Three of our Roommate Agreement, I'm calling an emergency meeting.",2,Big Bang Theory,127,19
6557,Leonard,10," No, you're not.",2,Big Bang Theory,16,3
6558,Sheldon,10," Leonard moves the meeting not occur. Is there a second? None heard, the motion fails. I'd like to begin the meeting by congratulating you on the progress in your relationship with Dr. Stephanie.",2,Big Bang Theory,195,33
6559,Leonard,10, Thank you.,2,Big Bang Theory,11,2
6560,Sheldon,10," That being said, we have to discuss the implementation of the agreed upon â€œcohabitationâ€ù rider which has been activated now that the two of you are living together.",2,Big Bang Theory,169,28
6561,Leonard,10, We're not living together.,2,Big Bang Theory,27,4
6562,Leonard,10, That's absurd.,2,Big Bang Theory,15,2
6563,Sheldon,10," You initialed it. See? L.H., L.H., L.H.",2,Big Bang Theory,40,7
6564,Leonard,10," Wait, I only initialed it because I never thought it would happen! I initialed another clause naming you my sidekick in case I get superpowers.",2,Big Bang Theory,144,25
6565,Sheldon,10," Hmm, yes, you did. Now, to review the following provisions are hereby activated. In the refrigerator, as opposed to us having two separate shelves and one communal shelf, the three of us now get individual shelves and the door becomes communal. Next, apartment vacuuming shall be increased from two to three times a week to accommodate the increased accumulation of dead skin cells. Third,the bathroom schedule. Now, I'm given to understand women have different needs, so, we'll have to discuss that.",2,Big Bang Theory,501,81
6566,Leonard,10, I'm going to bed.,2,Big Bang Theory,18,4
6567,Sheldon,10," At least take this with you. Look, and have Stephanie initial here, here, here, here and here. This states that she does not now nor does she intend to play a percussive or brass instrument. Sure it sounds like a tumor pressing on the auditory nerve.",2,Big Bang Theory,251,46
6569,Leonard,10," No, absolutely not.",2,Big Bang Theory,20,3
6570,Sheldon,10, It's not a big deal. We have latex gloves.,2,Big Bang Theory,43,9
6571,Leonard,10," I don't care what the symptoms are, my girlfriend is not going to give you a prostate exam.",2,Big Bang Theory,92,18
6573,Sheldon,10," Good morning, Dr. Stephanie. I trust Leonard satisfied you sexually last night.",2,Big Bang Theory,80,12
6574,Leonard,10," Oh come on! Sheldon, we don't ask questions like that.",2,Big Bang Theory,55,10
6575,Sheldon,10, I heard you ask it over and over. How is it inappropriate for me to ask it once?,2,Big Bang Theory,81,18
6577,Sheldon,10, See? She's not offended. And now you finally have an answer.,2,Big Bang Theory,61,11
6578,Penny,10, Out of coffee. Need coffee.,2,Big Bang Theory,28,5
6580,Penny,10," Hi! Stephanie, right?",2,Big Bang Theory,22,3
6582,Penny,10," I'm Penny, I live across the hall. I've heard a lot about you.",2,Big Bang Theory,63,13
6584,Penny,10, Mm-hmm.,2,Big Bang Theory,8,1
6586,Leonard,10," She's heard about you because we're, you know, involved and you haven't heard about her because I never slept with her, I swear!",2,Big Bang Theory,129,23
6587,Sheldon,10," In Leonard's defence, it wasn't for lack of trying.",2,Big Bang Theory,52,9
6588,Leonard,10," Thank you, Sheldon.",2,Big Bang Theory,20,3
6589,Sheldon,10," You're welcome, Leonard.",2,Big Bang Theory,25,3
6590,Leonard,10," Look, I'm just saying, um, Penny is one of our many neighbours, you know, and in our building, neighbours come and go, it's very casual, no dress code. In fact, some mornings I'll just mosey down to the third floor in my pyjamas and have cereal with Mrs. Vartabedian.",2,Big Bang Theory,268,49
6591,Sheldon,10, Really? I have never once been invited to have cereal with Mrs. Vartabedian.,2,Big Bang Theory,77,13
6592,Leonard,10," She doesn't like you. Um, well, uh, you have a gall bladder to remove and I have to get in the shower and Penny has clothes to put on, so",2,Big Bang Theory,138,30
6594,Penny,10," Nice to finally meet you, too.",2,Big Bang Theory,31,6
6596,Leonard,10," Okay, bye-bye.",2,Big Bang Theory,15,2
6598,Sheldon,10, What could I possibly have done to offend Mrs. Vartabedian?,2,Big Bang Theory,60,10
6599,Penny,10," So, that's Stephanie, huh?",2,Big Bang Theory,27,4
6600,Leonard,10, Why do I feel like I'm the one that just got the prostate exam?,2,Big Bang Theory,64,14
6601,Penny,10," You know, she seems very nice.",2,Big Bang Theory,31,6
6602,Sheldon,10," Oh, she is. She's terrific, and she's proving to be a valuable roommate.",2,Big Bang Theory,73,13
6603,Penny,10, Roommate? You guys are living together?,2,Big Bang Theory,40,6
6604,Sheldon,10, Like hippies.,2,Big Bang Theory,14,2
6605,Leonard,10, We're not living together.,2,Big Bang Theory,27,4
6606,Sheldon,10, Do I have to pull out the paperwork again?,2,Big Bang Theory,43,9
6607,Leonard,10, We're not living together.,2,Big Bang Theory,27,4
6608,Penny,10, Are you sure?,2,Big Bang Theory,14,3
6609,Leonard,10, How could I not be sure?,2,Big Bang Theory,25,6
6610,Penny,10," Well, let's find out.",2,Big Bang Theory,22,4
6611,Leonard,10, Don't you think if a woman was living with me I'd be the first one to know about it?,2,Big Bang Theory,85,19
6612,Penny,10," Oh, sweetie, you'd be the last one to know about it.  Hmm, cute dresses. I bet this looks great on you!",2,Big Bang Theory,104,21
6613,Leonard,10, We're not living together.,2,Big Bang Theory,27,4
6614,Penny,10," Okay, hmm, scented candles, fuzzy slippers, ooh, floral bed sheets?",2,Big Bang Theory,68,10
6615,Leonard,10, We're not living together.,2,Big Bang Theory,27,4
6616,Penny,10," Okay, moving on. Now, who are these guys at Disney World?",2,Big Bang Theory,58,11
6617,Leonard,10," Uh, the big dog is Goofy, and the older couple with the mouse ears , I have no idea. We're not living together!",2,Big Bang Theory,112,23
6618,Penny,10," You're going to go down swinging, huh? All right, well, we got your body lotion, your InStyle Magazine, your jewellery box.",2,Big Bang Theory,124,21
6619,Leonard,10, We're not Where's my Bat Signal?,2,Big Bang Theory,33,6
6620,Penny,10, You have a Bat Signal?,2,Big Bang Theory,23,5
6621,Leonard,10," I did. It was right here. She must've Oh, my God, we're living together.",2,Big Bang Theory,73,14
6622,Penny,10, Really? What was your first clue?,2,Big Bang Theory,34,6
6624,Howard,10, New pants?,2,Big Bang Theory,11,2
6625,Leonard,10," Yeah, Stephanie got them for me.",2,Big Bang Theory,33,6
6626,Howard,10, Nice. Cotton?,2,Big Bang Theory,14,2
6627,Leonard,10," Actually, I think it's more of wool, fire ant blend.",2,Big Bang Theory,53,10
6628,Howard,10," So, the girlfriend's buying clothes for you, huh? Sounds serious.",2,Big Bang Theory,66,10
6629,Leonard,10," It is actually. In fact, I gave it a lot of thought and I decided it was time for us to live together.",2,Big Bang Theory,103,23
6630,Howard,10," Uh, Leonard, huge mistake. There's a whole buffet of women out there and you're just standing in the corner eating the same devilled egg over and over again.",2,Big Bang Theory,158,28
6631,Leonard,10, At least I have an egg. What do you have?,2,Big Bang Theory,42,10
6632,Howard,10, A veritable smorgasbord of potential sexual partners. See the blonde over there? I can hit on her and you can't.,2,Big Bang Theory,113,20
6633,Leonard,10," So, go hit on her.",2,Big Bang Theory,19,5
6634,Howard,10, She's not my type.,2,Big Bang Theory,19,4
6635,Raj,10," Too bad, 'cause she was checking you out before.",2,Big Bang Theory,49,9
6636,Howard,10, She was?,2,Big Bang Theory,9,2
6637,Raj,10, Of course not. Look at her.,2,Big Bang Theory,28,6
6638,Leonard,10," I don't care what you guys think, Stephanie and I are very happy living together. I will give either of you 20 dollars, right now to trade pants with me.",2,Big Bang Theory,154,30
6641,Sheldon,10, Hang on. 130 over 80. A little high. We can attribute that to the stress of sneaking past the security desk.,2,Big Bang Theory,109,21
6643,Sheldon,10," My aunt Marion gave them to me for my 12th birthday. She thought if I failed at theoretical physics that I should have a trade to fall back on. And by the way, the blood pressure cuff is called a sphygmomanometer.",2,Big Bang Theory,214,41
6645,Sheldon,10, Didn't they teach you that in medical school?,2,Big Bang Theory,46,8
6647,Sheldon,10, I understand. All I need is for you to authorize these tests.,2,Big Bang Theory,62,12
6649,Sheldon,10," Oh, and an exploratory laparoscopy. Last time I had hiccups, it felt like my diaphragm was just going through the motions.",2,Big Bang Theory,123,21
6651,Sheldon,10, Can I at least have the upper GI? I already drank the barium!,2,Big Bang Theory,62,13
6653,Penny,10, Oh hey.,2,Big Bang Theory,8,2
6654,Leonard,10," Oh, good. Do you have any fabric softener?",2,Big Bang Theory,43,8
6655,Penny,10," Yeah, sure. What are you washing? A crocodile?",2,Big Bang Theory,47,8
6656,Leonard,10," No, the pants that Stephanie got me.",2,Big Bang Theory,37,7
6657,Penny,10," Oh, sweetie, you can't machine wash these. They'll be ruined.",2,Big Bang Theory,62,10
6658,Leonard,10, Are you sure?,2,Big Bang Theory,14,3
6659,Penny,10, Absolutely.,2,Big Bang Theory,12,1
6660,Leonard,10," Oh, no. I wish you'd told me that sooner.",2,Big Bang Theory,42,9
6661,Penny,10, Are you guys having problems?,2,Big Bang Theory,30,5
6662,Leonard,10," No, everything's fine.",2,Big Bang Theory,23,3
6663,Penny,10, Really?,2,Big Bang Theory,8,1
6664,Leonard,10," Yeah. It's wonderful. Okay, maybe this whole living together happened kind of suddenly, but it's fine, it's great.",2,Big Bang Theory,115,18
6665,Penny,10," Okay, Leonard, honey, you know, if you're uncomfortable with the way things are going, you're allowed to say something.",2,Big Bang Theory,120,19
6666,Leonard,10, Are you sure? That doesn't sound right.,2,Big Bang Theory,40,7
6667,Penny,10," Believe me, your feelings are just as important as hers.",2,Big Bang Theory,57,10
6668,Leonard,10, No that doesn't sound right either.,2,Big Bang Theory,36,6
6669,Penny,10, Just tell her you need the relationship to move at a pace that you both are comfortable with.,2,Big Bang Theory,94,18
6670,Leonard,10," Yeah, I could say something like that to her. I'll go do that. Thank you.",2,Big Bang Theory,74,15
6671,Penny,10, Sure.,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
6672,Leonard,10, You have a really good grasp on this. Maybe you could talk to her?,2,Big Bang Theory,67,14
6673,Penny,10," You're kidding, right?",2,Big Bang Theory,23,3
6674,Leonard,10," No, but that's okay. I'll go talk to her. Want to come with?",2,Big Bang Theory,61,13
6675,Penny,10, Go! Wow.,2,Big Bang Theory,9,2
6678,Sheldon,10, Wha??,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
6680,Sheldon,10, I knew it! What do I do?,2,Big Bang Theory,25,7
6682,Sheldon,10, For how,2,Big Bang Theory,8,2
6684,Leonard,10, Hey.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
6686,Leonard,10, Sheldon.  What's going on?,2,Big Bang Theory,27,4
6688,Leonard,10," Careful, if you don't get it all, it'll only come back worse.",2,Big Bang Theory,62,12
6690,Leonard,10," Listen, we need to talk.",2,Big Bang Theory,25,5
6692,Leonard,10, I don't know what that means.,2,Big Bang Theory,30,6
6694,Leonard,10," Okay, um, well, look, it's just that things between you and me have been going pretty quick.",2,Big Bang Theory,93,17
6696,Leonard,10, It's just a little scary.,2,Big Bang Theory,26,5
6698,Leonard,10," Sure, when is scary not good? But, okay, um, I have feelings, right?",2,Big Bang Theory,69,13
6700,Leonard,10," Okay, and it's perfectly okay to express those feelings, right?",2,Big Bang Theory,64,10
6702,Leonard,10," Okay, well, I ju I think it's important to remember that we move at a pace that is our speed and oh, shoot, I had it!",2,Big Bang Theory,118,26
6704,Leonard,10, What's that? Really? Right now?,2,Big Bang Theory,32,5
6706,Leonard,10," I just ate, aren't you supposed to wait an hour?",2,Big Bang Theory,49,10
6708,Leonard,10," Oh, okay. I just hope I don't get cramps.",2,Big Bang Theory,42,9
6711,Leonard,10, Hey.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
6712,Penny,10," Hey. Oh, I put your clothes in the dryer.",2,Big Bang Theory,42,9
6713,Leonard,10, Thank you.,2,Big Bang Theory,11,2
6714,Penny,10, Your pants are ruined.,2,Big Bang Theory,23,4
6715,Leonard,10, Good.,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
6716,Penny,10," So, how did the talk with Stephanie go?",2,Big Bang Theory,40,8
6717,Leonard,10," Well, um, on one level, really, really well.",2,Big Bang Theory,45,8
6718,Penny,10," So, you told her you wanted to slow things down?",2,Big Bang Theory,49,10
6719,Leonard,10," Not specifically, but, uh, I did tell her that I had feelings.",2,Big Bang Theory,63,12
6720,Penny,10," Good, good. And then what?",2,Big Bang Theory,27,5
6721,Leonard,10," And then the, the subject got changed somehow.",2,Big Bang Theory,47,8
6722,Penny,10," You had sex, didn't you?",2,Big Bang Theory,25,5
6723,Leonard,10," Um, little bit.  What?",2,Big Bang Theory,23,4
6724,Penny,10," Nothing. Okay, well, it sounds like things are going to work out.",2,Big Bang Theory,66,12
6725,Leonard,10," Yeah, yeah it's all good. Everything's going to work out. One way or another.",2,Big Bang Theory,78,14
6726,Penny,10," Come on, Leonard, you are entitled to try and make things go the way you want them to.",2,Big Bang Theory,87,18
6727,Leonard,10, Really?,2,Big Bang Theory,8,1
6728,Penny,10," Yes, you don't always have to go along with what the woman wants.",2,Big Bang Theory,66,13
6729,Leonard,10, Huh.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
6730,Penny,10, What?,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
6731,Leonard,10," Nothing, just rethinking my whole life. Okay, here's the thing, I'm afraid that if I ask her to move out, she'll just dump me.",2,Big Bang Theory,127,24
6732,Penny,10," Well, it's a chance you have to take. I mean, look, if it's meant to be, it'll be.",2,Big Bang Theory,83,18
6733,Leonard,10," Very comforting. Okay, so what do I say to her?",2,Big Bang Theory,48,10
6734,Penny,10," I don't know. I mean, what have women said to you when they wanted to slow a relationship down?",2,Big Bang Theory,96,19
6735,Leonard,10," I really like you, but I want to see how things go with Mark?",2,Big Bang Theory,62,14
6736,Penny,10," Yeah, that'll slow it down.",2,Big Bang Theory,28,5
6739,Leonard,10," Oh, right, yeah, um, so, Stephanie, here's the thing. I really like you.",2,Big Bang Theory,73,13
6741,Leonard,10, What speech?,2,Big Bang Theory,13,2
6743,Leonard,10," No! No, no! I wasn't going to say any of that. I was just going to say, I really like you.",2,Big Bang Theory,91,21
6745,Leonard,10, Terrific.,2,Big Bang Theory,10,1
6747,Leonard,10, Hey.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
6748,Raj,10, Hey.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
6749,Howard,10, Hey. Nice sweater.,2,Big Bang Theory,19,3
6750,Leonard,10," Yeah, Stephanie got it for me. It's kind of fun.",2,Big Bang Theory,49,10
6751,Raj,10," It's got a big bird on it, dude.",2,Big Bang Theory,33,8
6752,Leonard,10," Yeah, yeah, that's the fun part. We're also getting new curtains for my bedroom, and a dust ruffle, and a duvet, and I don't even know what a duvet is but I'm pretty sure if I did I wouldn't want one, but every time I talk to her about moving out she cries and we have sex.",2,Big Bang Theory,274,57
6753,Raj,10," You're lucky. With me, it's usually the other way around.",2,Big Bang Theory,58,10
6754,Howard,10," You know, if you can't talk to her, why don't you just text her?",2,Big Bang Theory,65,14
6755,Leonard,10, Isn't that kind of cowardly?,2,Big Bang Theory,29,5
6756,Howard,10," Oh, yeah. It's beyond contemptible.",2,Big Bang Theory,36,5
6757,Raj,10," It's true, but on the other hand you are wearing a bird sweater.",2,Big Bang Theory,65,13
6758,Leonard,10, Sold. â€œI think it would be better for our relationship if you moved back to your place.â€ù There. It's done.,2,Big Bang Theory,111,20
6759,Howard,10, Good for you.,2,Big Bang Theory,14,3
6760,Leonard,10," Yeah, good for me. I'll never have sex again.  I was wrong. See ya.",2,Big Bang Theory,68,14
6762,Penny,10, Sheldon?,2,Big Bang Theory,9,1
6764,Penny,10, Okay?,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
6766,Penny,10," Okay, let me check.",2,Big Bang Theory,20,4
6768,Penny,10, Hiney?,2,Big Bang Theory,7,1
6771,Sheldon,11," Your argument is lacking in all scientific merit. It is well established Superman cleans his uniform by flying into Earth's yellow sun, which incinerates any contaminate matter and leaves the invulnerable Kryptonian fabric unharmed and daisy fresh.",2,Big Bang Theory,249,37
6772,Howard,11, What if he gets something Kryptonian on it?,2,Big Bang Theory,44,8
6773,Sheldon,11, Like what?,2,Big Bang Theory,11,2
6774,Howard,11, I don't know. Kryptonian mustard.,2,Big Bang Theory,34,5
6775,Sheldon,11, I think we can safely assume that all Kryptonian condiments were destroyed when the planet Krypton exploded.,2,Big Bang Theory,109,17
6776,Raj,11," Or it turned into mustard Kryptonite, the only way to destroy a rogue Kryptonian hotdog threatening Earth.",2,Big Bang Theory,107,17
6777,Leonard,11," Raj, please, let's stay serious here. Superman's body is Kryptonian, therefore his sweat is Kryptonian.",2,Big Bang Theory,104,15
6778,Howard,11," Yeah, what about Kryptonian pit stains?",2,Big Bang Theory,40,6
6779,Sheldon,11, Superman doesn't sweat on Earth.,2,Big Bang Theory,33,5
6780,Howard,11," Okay, he's invited for dinner in the Bottle City of Kandor. He miniaturizes himself, enters the city where he loses his superpowers. Now, before dinner, his host says, â€œwho's up for a little Kryptonian tetherball?â€ù Superman says â€œsure,â€ù works up a sweat, comes back to Earth, his uniform now stained with indestructible Kryptonian perspiration.",2,Big Bang Theory,353,54
6781,Raj,11, Booya.,2,Big Bang Theory,7,1
6782,Sheldon,11, Superman would have taken his uniform to a Kandorian dry cleaner before he left the Bottle.,2,Big Bang Theory,92,16
6783,Raj,11," â€œKandorian dry clâ€ù I give up, you can't have a rational argument with this man.",2,Big Bang Theory,84,15
6784,Howard,11," Hey, isn't that the guy who won the MacArthur genius grant last year? No, not all at once.",2,Big Bang Theory,91,18
6785,Raj,11, Then how?,2,Big Bang Theory,10,2
6786,Howard,11," Leonard. Now, Raj. Now, Sheldon.",2,Big Bang Theory,33,5
6787,Raj,11, I didn't get a good look. Can I go again?,2,Big Bang Theory,42,10
6788,Howard,11, No.,2,Big Bang Theory,4,1
6789,Leonard,11, It's David Underhill. So what?,2,Big Bang Theory,31,5
6790,Sheldon,11, So what? His observation of high-energy positrons has provided the first conclusive evidence for the existence of galactic dark matter.,2,Big Bang Theory,136,20
6791,Leonard,11," I have two words for you. The first is big, the other's whoop.",2,Big Bang Theory,63,13
6792,Sheldon,11, It is a big whoop. It made almost all the work you've done since you've been here completely useless.,2,Big Bang Theory,102,19
6793,Leonard,11, Did not.,2,Big Bang Theory,9,2
6794,Howard,11," Did, too.",2,Big Bang Theory,10,2
6795,Leonard,11," Did okay, maybe some of it, but, look, the guy was just in the right place, at the right time with the right paradigm-shifting reinterpretation of the universe. He got lucky.",2,Big Bang Theory,175,31
6796,Raj,11, In more ways than one. He's a very handsome man.,2,Big Bang Theory,49,10
6797,Howard,11," Doesn't do anything for me. If I was gonna go that way, I'm more of a Zac Ephron kinda guy.",2,Big Bang Theory,92,20
6798,Raj,11," Oh, yeah, like you have a shot with Zac Ephron.",2,Big Bang Theory,48,10
6800,Leonard,11," Uh, yeah.",2,Big Bang Theory,10,2
6802,Leonard,11," Uh, y-yeah.",2,Big Bang Theory,12,2
6804,Leonard,11, You want to work with me?,2,Big Bang Theory,26,6
6806,Leonard,11," Wow, y-yeah, sure. Yeah, no problem. Uh, Here's my home number, here's my cell, here's my office, here's my parents' number up in New Jersey, they always know how to reach me. So",2,Big Bang Theory,179,33
6808,Leonard,11," Congratulations on the MacArthur Grant, by the way. Big fan.",2,Big Bang Theory,61,10
6810,Leonard,11, Okay. Bye-bye! What are you looking at?You've never seen a hypocrite before?,2,Big Bang Theory,77,12
6812,Raj,11," Trailing badly, Wolowitz needs a strike if he has any hopes of catching up with Sheldon Cooper, who is dominating in the ninth frame with a career-best 68.",2,Big Bang Theory,156,28
6813,Leonard,11," Hey, guys!",2,Big Bang Theory,11,2
6814,Howard,11, That doesn't count. Do over! Do over!,2,Big Bang Theory,38,7
6815,Sheldon,11, There are no do-overs in Wii bowling.,2,Big Bang Theory,38,7
6816,Howard,11, There are always do-overs when my people play sports.,2,Big Bang Theory,54,9
6817,Sheldon,11, Where were you that's more important than Wii bowling night?,2,Big Bang Theory,61,10
6818,Leonard,11," Actually, I was",2,Big Bang Theory,16,3
6819,Sheldon,11, It's a rhetorical question. There is nothing more important than Wii bowling night.,2,Big Bang Theory,84,13
6820,Leonard,11," Come on, it's just a video game. And we suck at it.",2,Big Bang Theory,52,12
6821,Sheldon,11, Nice motivational speech from the team captain.,2,Big Bang Theory,48,7
6822,Howard,11, Where were you?,2,Big Bang Theory,16,3
6823,Leonard,11, I was working with Dave Underhill.,2,Big Bang Theory,35,6
6824,Howard,11," Ooh, â€œDave.â€ù Sounds like Leonard's got a new BFF.",2,Big Bang Theory,54,9
6825,Leonard,11," Actually, he's pretty cool. I mean, not only is he a brilliant scientist, but it turns out he's a Black Diamond skier, he collects vintage motorcycles, he plays in a rock band.",2,Big Bang Theory,177,32
6826,Howard,11, So? We're in a rock band.,2,Big Bang Theory,26,6
6827,Leonard,11," No, we play Rock Band on our X-Box.",2,Big Bang Theory,36,8
6828,Sheldon,11, Nice motivational speech from our lead guitarist.,2,Big Bang Theory,50,7
6829,Leonard,11," He's funny, too. He does this hysterical impersonation of Stephen Hawking having phone sex. What are you wearing? That's not, he does it better. Anyway, he said he was gonna take me to the gym tomorrow, so I'm gonna go practice my situps.",2,Big Bang Theory,239,43
6830,Raj,11," Whoa. Humongous man crush, dude.",2,Big Bang Theory,33,5
6831,Howard,11, Yep. It's officially a bro-mance.,2,Big Bang Theory,34,5
6832,Penny,11," Hey, Sheldon, are you and Leonard putting up a Christmas tree?",2,Big Bang Theory,63,11
6833,Sheldon,11," No, because we don't celebrate the ancient pagan festival of Saturnalia.",2,Big Bang Theory,73,11
6834,Penny,11, Saturnalia?,2,Big Bang Theory,12,1
6835,Howard,11," Gather round, kids, it's time for Sheldon's beloved Christmas special.",2,Big Bang Theory,71,10
6836,Sheldon,11," In the pre-Christian era, as the winter solstice approached and the plants died, pagans brought evergreen boughs into their homes as an act of sympathetic magic, intended to guard the life essences of the plants until spring. This custom was later appropriated by Northern Europeans and eventually it becomes the so-called Christmas tree.",2,Big Bang Theory,339,53
6837,Howard,11," And that, Charlie Brown, is what boredom is all about.",2,Big Bang Theory,55,10
6838,Penny,11," Okay, well, thank you for that, but I got you and Leonard a few silly neighbour gifts, so I'll just put them under my tree.",2,Big Bang Theory,124,25
6839,Sheldon,11, Wait! You bought me a present?,2,Big Bang Theory,31,6
6840,Penny,11, Uh-huh.,2,Big Bang Theory,8,1
6841,Sheldon,11, Why would you do such a thing?,2,Big Bang Theory,31,7
6842,Penny,11, I don't know. â€˜Cause it's Christmas?,2,Big Bang Theory,39,6
6843,Sheldon,11," Oh, Penny. I know you think you're being generous, but the foundation of gift-giving is reciprocity. You haven't given me a gift, you've given me an obligation.",2,Big Bang Theory,161,27
6844,Howard,11," Don't feel bad, Penny, it's a classic rookie mistake. My first Hanukkah with Sheldon, he yelled at me for eight nights.",2,Big Bang Theory,120,21
6845,Penny,11," Now, honey, it's okay.You don't have to get me anything in return.",2,Big Bang Theory,67,12
6846,Sheldon,11, Of course I do. The essence of the custom is that I now have to go out and purchase for you a gift of commensurate value and representing the same perceived level of friendship as that represented by the gift you've given me. It's no wonder suicide rates skyrocket this time of year.,2,Big Bang Theory,284,53
6847,Penny,11," Okay, you know what? Forget it. I'm not giving you a present.",2,Big Bang Theory,62,12
6848,Sheldon,11," No, it's too late. I see it. That elf sticker says to Sheldon. The die has been cast, the moving finger has writ, Hannibal has crossed the Alps.",2,Big Bang Theory,145,28
6849,Howard,11, I know. It's funny when it's not happening to us.,2,Big Bang Theory,50,10
6850,Penny,11," Sheldon, I am very, very sorry.",2,Big Bang Theory,32,6
6851,Sheldon,11," No. No, I brought this on myself by being such an endearing and important part of your life. I'm going to need a ride to the mall.",2,Big Bang Theory,131,27
6852,Howard,11, It's happening to us.,2,Big Bang Theory,22,4
6854,Leonard,11, Ow! Ow!,2,Big Bang Theory,8,2
6856,Leonard,11," Yeah, I guess.",2,Big Bang Theory,15,3
6858,Leonard,11, Thanks for letting me try out your motorcycle.,2,Big Bang Theory,47,8
6860,Leonard,11," I had no idea it was so heavy. The thing just fell right over on me, didn't it?",2,Big Bang Theory,80,18
6862,Penny,11," Oh, hey, Leonard. Ooh, are you okay?",2,Big Bang Theory,37,7
6863,Leonard,11," Oh, yeah. It's just a little motorcycle accident.",2,Big Bang Theory,50,8
6864,Penny,11," My God, how fast were you going?",2,Big Bang Theory,33,7
6865,Leonard,11, I don't know. It's all such a blur.,2,Big Bang Theory,36,8
6867,Penny,11, Hi. Penny. So it's your motorcycle?,2,Big Bang Theory,36,6
6869,Penny,11," Oh, is it okay?",2,Big Bang Theory,16,4
6871,Leonard,11," Yeah, lucky for the bike it landed on my leg.",2,Big Bang Theory,46,10
6873,Penny,11," Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure. So, um, Dave, how do you know Leonard?",2,Big Bang Theory,61,12
6875,Penny,11," Ha-ha. No, you're not.",2,Big Bang Theory,23,4
6877,Penny,11," Uh, well, it's just that the physicists I know are indoorsy and pale.",2,Big Bang Theory,70,13
6878,Leonard,11, I'm not indoorsy. I just wear the appropriate sun block because I don't take melanoma lightly.,2,Big Bang Theory,95,16
6879,Penny,11," So, are you and Leonard working on an experiment together?",2,Big Bang Theory,59,10
6881,Leonard,11," Yeah, we're examining the radiation levels of photomultiplier tubes for a new dark matter detector.",2,Big Bang Theory,100,15
6882,Penny,11," Uh, sweetie, sweetie, Dave was talking. You know, I love science.",2,Big Bang Theory,66,11
6883,Leonard,11, Since when?,2,Big Bang Theory,12,2
6884,Penny,11," Since always. Call me a geek, but I am just nuts for the whole subatomic particle thing.",2,Big Bang Theory,89,17
6886,Penny,11," Ha. Well, that's what I am, queen of the nerds.",2,Big Bang Theory,48,10
6888,Penny,11," You know, I have always wanted to see a big science lab.",2,Big Bang Theory,57,12
6889,Leonard,11, Since when?,2,Big Bang Theory,12,2
6890,Penny,11, Since always.,2,Big Bang Theory,14,2
6892,Leonard,11," Uh, yeah. I guess.",2,Big Bang Theory,19,4
6894,Penny,11," Um,yeah, yeah, that sounds great, let me just get my jacket.",2,Big Bang Theory,61,11
6896,Leonard,11," Yeah, if you like that type.",2,Big Bang Theory,29,6
6898,Leonard,11," No, just neighbours.",2,Big Bang Theory,21,3
6900,Leonard,11," Actually, science is my lady.",2,Big Bang Theory,30,5
6901,Penny,11, Okay. Let's go.,2,Big Bang Theory,16,3
6903,Leonard,11," See ya. â€˜Bye, Penny. Have fun. ",2,Big Bang Theory,34,6
6904,Sheldon,11, Yes?  Did you forget your key?,2,Big Bang Theory,31,6
6906,Sheldon,11, I don't see anything in here a woman would want.,2,Big Bang Theory,49,10
6907,Howard,11," You're kidding. You've got lotions and bath oils and soaps, that's the estrogen hat trick.",2,Big Bang Theory,91,15
6908,Leonard,11," What it is is a cacophonous assault of eucalyptus, bayberry, cinnamon and vanilla. It's as if my head were trapped in the pyjamas of a sultan.",2,Big Bang Theory,143,26
6909,Raj,11," Sheldon, if you don't like this stuff, let's just go next door and build her a bear.",2,Big Bang Theory,85,17
6910,Sheldon,11," I told you before, bears are terrifying.",2,Big Bang Theory,41,7
6911,Howard,11," Come on, bath stuff, it's perfect! You got a scented candle, a cleansing buff, spearmint and green tea scented bath oil, promotes relaxation.",2,Big Bang Theory,142,23
6912,Sheldon,11, That presupposes Penny is tense.,2,Big Bang Theory,33,5
6913,Raj,11, She knows you. She's tense. We all are. Buy a basket!,2,Big Bang Theory,54,11
6914,Howard,11," Excuse me, we're ready.",2,Big Bang Theory,24,4
6915,Sheldon,11," No, we're not. Let's say for a moment that I accept the bath item gift hypothesis, I now lay the following conundrum at your feet, which size?",2,Big Bang Theory,143,27
6916,Howard,11, This one. Let's go.,2,Big Bang Theory,20,4
6917,Sheldon,11, You put no thought into that.,2,Big Bang Theory,30,6
6918,Howard,11," I'm sorry. Uh, this one. Let's go!",2,Big Bang Theory,35,7
6919,Sheldon,11," I have insufficient data to proceed. Excuse me, miss?",2,Big Bang Theory,54,9
6921,Sheldon,11," If I were to give you this gift basket, based on that action alone and no other data, infer and describe the hypothetical relationship that exists between us.",2,Big Bang Theory,159,28
6923,Sheldon,11," Here. Now, are we friends? Colleagues? Lovers? Are you my grandmother?",2,Big Bang Theory,71,11
6925,Howard,11, See? Sounds just like you and Penny. We'll take it.,2,Big Bang Theory,52,10
6928,Leonard,11," Oh, hey, Dave. And Penny, what a surprise.",2,Big Bang Theory,43,8
6929,Penny,11," Hey, Leonard. Dave was just showing me around the university. You know, this place is unbelievable!",2,Big Bang Theory,100,16
6930,Leonard,11," Yeah, I know. I've been offering to show you around for a year and a half. You always said you had yoga.",2,Big Bang Theory,105,22
6931,Penny,11, I never said that.,2,Big Bang Theory,19,4
6932,Leonard,11, Maybe I heard you wrong. A lot of words sound like yoga.,2,Big Bang Theory,57,12
6934,Penny,11," Oh, shut up!",2,Big Bang Theory,13,3
6935,Leonard,11," Yes, please shut up. So, um, Dave, don't you think you and I should get back to the lab? You know, that dark matter isn't going to detect itself.",2,Big Bang Theory,146,29
6937,Penny,11, Really? We're going to do an experiment?,2,Big Bang Theory,41,7
6939,Penny,11, It's not an experiment! You saw what happened last night.,2,Big Bang Theory,58,10
6941,Penny,11," Yeah. Oh, can I drive the motorcycle?",2,Big Bang Theory,38,7
6943,Leonard,11," That's funny. By the way, my leg is killing me. Thanks for asking.",2,Big Bang Theory,67,13
6945,Sheldon,11," Mmm, great news, Leonard, I've solved my Penny gift dilemma.",2,Big Bang Theory,61,10
6946,Leonard,11, Yippee.,2,Big Bang Theory,8,1
6947,Sheldon,11," You see, the danger was that I might under or over-reciprocate, but I have devised a foolproof plan. See, I will open her gift to me first and then excuse myself, feigning digestive distress.",2,Big Bang Theory,192,34
6948,Leonard,11, Brilliant.,2,Big Bang Theory,11,1
6949,Sheldon,11," It is, isn't it? Is it okay if I hide them in your room? The smell makes me nauseated.",2,Big Bang Theory,87,19
6950,Leonard,11, Do whatever you want.,2,Big Bang Theory,22,4
6951,Sheldon,11," Thank you, that's very gracious. Gentlemen.",2,Big Bang Theory,44,6
6952,Howard,11, Why couldn't you have just done what Leonard did and get Penny a new boyfriend?,2,Big Bang Theory,80,15
6953,Leonard,11, My leg is killing me. Thanks for asking.,2,Big Bang Theory,41,8
6955,Leonard,11," Okay, I have just one question for you. While I am perfectly happy with the way things are between us, you said that you didn't want to go out with me because I was too smart for you! Well, news flash, lady, David Underhill is ten times smarter than me! You'd have to drive a railroad spike into his brain for me to beat him at checkers! Next to him, I'm like one of those sign-language gorillas who knows how to ask for grapes! So, my question is, what's up with that?",2,Big Bang Theory,470,92
6956,Penny,11, Why are you yelling at me?,2,Big Bang Theory,27,6
6957,Leonard,11," Sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! Never mind, we're cool.",2,Big Bang Theory,53,9
6958,Penny,11, Dave is not smarter than you. He's an idiot.,2,Big Bang Theory,45,9
6959,Leonard,11, Really? Why would you say that?,2,Big Bang Theory,32,6
6960,Penny,11, Because a smart guy takes the nude photos of his wife off his cell phone before he tries to take nude photos of his girlfriend.,2,Big Bang Theory,128,25
6961,Leonard,11, He tried to take nude photos of you?,2,Big Bang Theory,37,8
6962,Penny,11, That's what you took from that? The guy is married!,2,Big Bang Theory,52,10
6963,Leonard,11," Oh, yeah. I'm so oh, that's terrible.",2,Big Bang Theory,38,7
6964,Penny,11," And you, if you are so okay with the way things are between us, why are you so jealous?",2,Big Bang Theory,88,19
6965,Leonard,11," Well, uh, the important thing is he's married and that's terrible!",2,Big Bang Theory,67,11
6966,Penny,11," Nice save, genius. Eggnog?",2,Big Bang Theory,27,4
6967,Leonard,11, Lactose.,2,Big Bang Theory,9,1
6968,Penny,11, It's just rum. It stopped being eggnog like half an hour ago.,2,Big Bang Theory,62,12
6969,Leonard,11, Smooth.,2,Big Bang Theory,8,1
6970,Penny,11, Smoother than you.,2,Big Bang Theory,19,3
6971,Leonard,11," Come on, it's Christmas, just give me this one.",2,Big Bang Theory,48,9
6972,Penny,11," Okay, Merry Christmas.",2,Big Bang Theory,23,3
6973,Leonard,11," By the way, my leg is killing me. Thanks for asking.",2,Big Bang Theory,53,11
6975,Penny,11, Merry Christmas.,2,Big Bang Theory,17,2
6976,Leonard,11, Merry Christmas.,2,Big Bang Theory,17,2
6977,Penny,11, How's your leg?,2,Big Bang Theory,16,3
6978,Leonard,11," Very good, thanks for asking. Come on in.",2,Big Bang Theory,42,8
6979,Sheldon,11," Ah, good, Penny, you're here to exchange gifts. You'll be pleased to know I'm prepared for whatever you have to offer.",2,Big Bang Theory,119,21
6980,Penny,11," Okay, here.",2,Big Bang Theory,12,2
6981,Sheldon,11," I should note I'm having some digestive distress, so, if I excuse myself abruptly, don't be alarmed. Oh, a napkin.",2,Big Bang Theory,115,20
6982,Penny,11, Turn it over.,2,Big Bang Theory,14,3
6983,Sheldon,11," To Sheldon, live long and prosper. Leonard Nimoy.",2,Big Bang Theory,50,8
6984,Penny,11," Yeah, he came into the restaurant. Sorry the napkin's dirty. He wiped his mouth with it.",2,Big Bang Theory,89,16
6985,Sheldon,11, I possess the DNA of Leonard Nimoy?!,2,Big Bang Theory,37,7
6986,Penny,11," Well, yeah, yeah, I guess. But look, he signed it.",2,Big Bang Theory,51,10
6987,Sheldon,11, Do you realize what this means? All I need is a healthy ovum and I can grow my own Leonard Nimoy!,2,Big Bang Theory,98,21
6988,Penny,11," Okay, all I'm giving you is the napkin, Sheldon.",2,Big Bang Theory,49,9
6989,Sheldon,11, Be right back.,2,Big Bang Theory,15,3
6990,Penny,11, Here. Open it.,2,Big Bang Theory,15,3
6991,Leonard,11," Oh, a gift certificate for motorcycle lessons. Very thoughtful.",2,Big Bang Theory,64,9
6992,Penny,11," Yeah, and I checked. Not letting the bike fall on you while standing still is lesson one.",2,Big Bang Theory,90,17
6993,Leonard,11," Oh, then, I think you'll appreciate what I got you.",2,Big Bang Theory,52,10
6994,Penny,11, Okay. 101 Totally Cool Science Experiments for Kids.,2,Big Bang Theory,53,8
6995,Leonard,11," You know, 'cause you're so into science.",2,Big Bang Theory,41,7
6996,Penny,11, Sheldon! What did you do?!,2,Big Bang Theory,27,5
6997,Sheldon,11," I know! It's not enough, is it? Here.",2,Big Bang Theory,38,8
6998,Penny,11," Leonard, look! Sheldon's hugging me.",2,Big Bang Theory,37,5
6999,Leonard,11, It's a Saturnalia miracle.,2,Big Bang Theory,27,4
7001,Howard,12," All right, that's the last servo. Behold the Mobile Omnidirectional Neutralization and Termination Eradicator. Or",2,Big Bang Theory,114,15
7003,Howard,12," Featuring one articulated razor-sharp killing saw, one polycarbonate grinding and flipping wheel, steel armour plate exoskeleton top and bottom, and enough horsepower to drive a 110 pounds of mechanized death from zero to holy crap in 4.8 seconds.",2,Big Bang Theory,248,38
7004,Sheldon,12, Is it wrong to say I love our killer robot?,2,Big Bang Theory,44,10
7005,Raj,12," As with my father, I both love and fear it.",2,Big Bang Theory,44,10
7006,Howard,12," All right, enough chitchat, let's destroy something.",2,Big Bang Theory,53,7
7008,Raj,12, Okay. What shall be first to taste the wrath of Monte?,2,Big Bang Theory,55,11
7009,Leonard,12, Maybe we should start small.,2,Big Bang Theory,29,5
7010,Raj,12," Okay. Ooh, perhaps today is the day we finally find out what's inside the Magic Eight Ball.",2,Big Bang Theory,92,17
7011,Sheldon,12, Did it when I was four. It's an icosahedral dye floating in tinted blue water.,2,Big Bang Theory,79,15
7012,Raj,12," Man, call spoiler alert before you say things like that.",2,Big Bang Theory,57,10
7013,Leonard,12, How about the toaster oven?,2,Big Bang Theory,28,5
7014,Sheldon,12, What did the toaster oven ever do to you?,2,Big Bang Theory,42,9
7015,Leonard,12," What did I ever do to Jimmy Mullins in the third grade? He still punched me in the face with my own fists. Sorry, you little nerd, you were just in the wrong boys' room at the wrong time.",2,Big Bang Theory,188,39
7016,Howard,12," Gentlemen, goggles.",2,Big Bang Theory,20,2
7017,Sheldon,12," Yeah, this is an auspicious moment. Yeah, like Robert Oppenheimer or Neil Armstrong, we need the appropriate words to mark this historic scientific event.",2,Big Bang Theory,155,24
7018,Raj,12," How about â€œDie, toaster, dieâ€ù?",2,Big Bang Theory,35,5
7019,Leonard,12, That'll do it.,2,Big Bang Theory,15,3
7020,Raj,12," All right, what's next?",2,Big Bang Theory,24,4
7022,Penny,12," No, I think I'm just going to stay in tonight and do laundry. ",2,Big Bang Theory,63,13
7024,Howard,12," Oh yeah, they still got the full Monte.",2,Big Bang Theory,40,8
7025,Penny,12, Leonard?,2,Big Bang Theory,9,1
7026,Leonard,12, Uh-huh?,2,Big Bang Theory,8,1
7027,Penny,12, What the hell?,2,Big Bang Theory,15,3
7028,Leonard,12, Killer robot. We built it.,2,Big Bang Theory,27,5
7029,Penny,12," Yeah, well, it almost killed me.",2,Big Bang Theory,33,6
7030,Sheldon,12," If it wanted to kill you, you'd be dead.",2,Big Bang Theory,41,9
7031,Penny,12," So, who exactly does it want to kill?",2,Big Bang Theory,38,8
7032,Sheldon,12," I'm sorry, are you unaware of the upcoming Southern California Robot Fighting League Round Robin Invitational?",2,Big Bang Theory,111,16
7033,Penny,12," You know, since I moved last year, not all my mail has been forwarded.",2,Big Bang Theory,71,14
7034,Howard,12, It's a big deal. There's an awards banquet and a dance afterward. Perhaps you'd like to come with me. I know the other fellas would be really excited to see a girl there.,2,Big Bang Theory,171,33
7035,Penny,12, How is it supposed to be a dance if I'm the only girl?,2,Big Bang Theory,55,13
7036,Howard,12," Well, that may be a slight exaggeration. You'd be the only doable girl.",2,Big Bang Theory,72,13
7037,Penny,12," You're a pig, Howard.",2,Big Bang Theory,22,4
7038,Howard,12, How is doable anything but a compliment?,2,Big Bang Theory,41,7
7039,Leonard,12," Howard, why don't we just work on the robot?",2,Big Bang Theory,45,9
7040,Howard,12," Please, Leonard, not now. Once again, Penny and I have begun our little tango.",2,Big Bang Theory,79,14
7041,Penny,12, Our tango?,2,Big Bang Theory,11,2
7042,Howard,12," The carnal repartee, the erotic to and fro. But as delicious as the appetizer might be, at some point we will have to succumb and eat the entree while it's still hot.",2,Big Bang Theory,167,32
7043,Leonard,12," I'm begging you, stop talking.",2,Big Bang Theory,31,5
7044,Penny,12," Look, normally I can just ignore you. I mean, I get it, you're a little peculiar. You know, like Sheldon.",2,Big Bang Theory,106,20
7045,Sheldon,12," Yeah, excuse me, Penny, but in this room, you're the one who's peculiar.",2,Big Bang Theory,73,13
7046,Penny,12," Yeah, you might be right. But back to you. I know you think you're some sort of smooth-talking ladies' man, but the truth is, you are just pathetic and creepy.",2,Big Bang Theory,160,30
7047,Howard,12," Um, so what are you saying?",2,Big Bang Theory,28,6
7048,Penny,12," I am saying it is not a compliment to call me doable. It's not sexy to stare at my ass and say, â€œOoh, it must be jelly 'cause jam don't shake like that.â€ù And most important, we are not dancing a tango, we're not to'ing and fro'ing. Nothing is ever going to happen between us. Ever.",2,Big Bang Theory,286,56
7049,Howard,12," Wait a minute. This isn't flirting, you're serious.",2,Big Bang Theory,52,8
7050,Penny,12," Flirting? You think I'm flirting with you? I am not flirting with you, no woman is ever gonna flirt with you, you're just gonna grow old and die alone.",2,Big Bang Theory,152,29
7051,Howard,12, Thanks for the heads up.,2,Big Bang Theory,25,5
7052,Leonard,12," Howard, where you going?",2,Big Bang Theory,25,4
7053,Howard,12," I'm going home to live my creepy, pathetic life.",2,Big Bang Theory,49,9
7054,Leonard,12, Wow.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
7055,Penny,12," Well, someone had to say it.  What?",2,Big Bang Theory,36,7
7056,Leonard,12, He said maybe we should enter you in the killer robot competition.,2,Big Bang Theory,67,12
7059,Howard,12," Here's a crazy idea, Ma, answer it!",2,Big Bang Theory,36,7
7061,Howard,12," I don't go to school, Ma. I work at a university.",2,Big Bang Theory,50,11
7063,Howard,12, I don't want to talk to anybody.,2,Big Bang Theory,33,7
7065,Howard,12, I don't have homework. I'm a grown man with a master's degree in engineering!,2,Big Bang Theory,78,14
7067,Howard,12," Cherry, please!",2,Big Bang Theory,16,2
7069,Howard,12, You make me want to kill myself.,2,Big Bang Theory,33,7
7071,Raj,12, What's going on?,2,Big Bang Theory,17,3
7072,Leonard,12," I don't know, now they're just yelling about Popsicles. Sounds like Penny really got to him.",2,Big Bang Theory,93,16
7073,Raj,12," I'm not surprised. Despite his hard and crusty shell, Howard is a very sensitive man. Do you know he writes poetry? Mostly about men from Nantucket and hermits named Dave, but he does it with real sensitivity.",2,Big Bang Theory,210,37
7075,Leonard,12," Yes, we did, Kripke.",2,Big Bang Theory,21,4
7076,Sheldon,12, His name is Monte.,2,Big Bang Theory,19,4
7078,Leonard,12," Come on, is that really necessary?",2,Big Bang Theory,35,6
7079,Sheldon,12," Leonard, I believe it is. This is trash talk, and trash talk is a traditional component in all sporting events. Kripke, your robot is inferior and it will be defeated by ours because ours exceeds yours in both design and execution. Also, I'm given to understand that your mother is overweight.",2,Big Bang Theory,294,51
7080,Raj,12," Oh, snap.",2,Big Bang Theory,10,2
7081,Sheldon,12," Now, of course, if that is the result of a glandular condition and not sloth and gluttony, I withdraw that comment.",2,Big Bang Theory,116,21
7082,Raj,12, What difference does it make? Fat is fat.,2,Big Bang Theory,42,8
7083,Sheldon,12, There are boundaries.,2,Big Bang Theory,22,3
7085,Sheldon,12, What do you mean?,2,Big Bang Theory,18,4
7087,Sheldon,12, We accept your challenge. Name a time and place.,2,Big Bang Theory,49,9
7089,Sheldon,12, Make it so.,2,Big Bang Theory,12,3
7090,Leonard,12," No, don't make it so. Barry, we can't fight you tomorrow, our engineer is incapacitated.",2,Big Bang Theory,89,15
7092,Raj,12, He's depressed because he's pathetic and creepy and he can't get girls.,2,Big Bang Theory,72,12
7094,Raj,12," I'm curious, what part of America is that accent from?",2,Big Bang Theory,55,10
7096,Penny,12, Hey.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
7097,Leonard,12," Hey, you got a minute?",2,Big Bang Theory,23,5
7098,Penny,12," Yeah, come on in. What's up?",2,Big Bang Theory,29,6
7099,Leonard,12, I need you to apologize to How,2,Big Bang Theory,31,7
7100,Penny,12, Get out.,2,Big Bang Theory,9,2
7101,Leonard,12, Come on. Wolowitz won't come out of his house and we need him for a robot battle.,2,Big Bang Theory,82,17
7102,Penny,12," Well, then have the robot go and get him.",2,Big Bang Theory,42,9
7103,Leonard,12, The robot didn't hurt his feelings.,2,Big Bang Theory,36,6
7104,Penny,12, His feelings needed to be hurt.,2,Big Bang Theory,32,6
7105,Leonard,12, He's been in bed for two days.,2,Big Bang Theory,31,7
7106,Penny,12," Yeah, probably with a blow-up doll.",2,Big Bang Theory,36,6
7107,Leonard,12, He's not with a does it really matter who or what he's with? The guy is devastated.,2,Big Bang Theory,84,17
7108,Penny,12," Oh, please, how could I possibly devastate Howard?",2,Big Bang Theory,51,8
7109,Leonard,12," Okay, don't take this as a criticism, but you kind of have that overexposed-to-gamma-rays thing going on.",2,Big Bang Theory,106,17
7110,Penny,12, What does that mean?,2,Big Bang Theory,21,4
7111,Leonard,12," You know, like, most of the time, you're the easygoing Bruce Banner, but then, when you get angry, you kind of turn into, like, you know, grrrrr!",2,Big Bang Theory,146,27
7112,Penny,12, I turn into a bear?,2,Big Bang Theory,20,5
7113,Leonard,12," Seriously? Gamma rays? Bruce Banner? You didn't get The Incredible Hulk from that? Never mind, just, please go talk to him.",2,Big Bang Theory,124,21
7114,Penny,12," And say what? That I didn't mean it, because I meant it.",2,Big Bang Theory,57,12
7115,Leonard,12," Well, maybe you can go at it from a different angle, like, um, you see a glimmer of goodness in him and you only said what you said because you want to nurture it and make it shine.",2,Big Bang Theory,182,38
7116,Penny,12," Oh, pthththth.",2,Big Bang Theory,15,2
7117,Leonard,12," Okay, let's try it this way. Remember the day that we first met and you asked me to go to your boyfriend's apartment to get your TV back and he was nine feet tall and he took my pants off and you said what was that? What did you say? Oh, yes, you said you owed me one.",2,Big Bang Theory,269,58
7118,Penny,12," Okay, come on, that's not fair.",2,Big Bang Theory,32,6
7119,Leonard,12, I came home with no pants.,2,Big Bang Theory,27,6
7120,Penny,12," Fine, I'll go over there tomorrow.",2,Big Bang Theory,35,6
7121,Leonard,12, Thank you. I should probably give you a heads up about his mother.,2,Big Bang Theory,67,13
7122,Penny,12, What about her?,2,Big Bang Theory,16,3
7123,Leonard,12, She's a delightful woman. You'll love her.,2,Big Bang Theory,43,7
7126,Howard,12, Who?,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
7128,Howard,12, I don't want to talk to her.,2,Big Bang Theory,29,7
7129,Penny,12, Hey.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
7130,Howard,12, Ma!,2,Big Bang Theory,4,1
7132,Penny,12," So, I just came by to see how you were doing.",2,Big Bang Theory,46,11
7133,Howard,12, I'm fine.,2,Big Bang Theory,10,2
7134,Penny,12, Good. Your mom seems nice.,2,Big Bang Theory,27,5
7135,Howard,12, People move away from her on the bus. What do you want?,2,Big Bang Theory,56,12
7136,Penny,12," Okay, look. Howard, I just want to apologize for some things that I have said. About you. I've been informed that you have feelings. And apparently, I have hurt them. So, I'm sorry. Howard.",2,Big Bang Theory,190,34
7137,Howard,12," Fine, you're sorry. Good-bye.",2,Big Bang Theory,30,4
7138,Penny,12," So, you're okay?",2,Big Bang Theory,17,3
7139,Howard,12," Hey, I'm a big boy. I'm not traumatized by some random comment from some random woman. I mean, get over yourself.",2,Big Bang Theory,114,21
7140,Penny,12," Okay. Well, bye.  So close ",2,Big Bang Theory,28,5
7142,Leonard,12," Oh, my God. That's Kripke's robot?",2,Big Bang Theory,35,6
7144,Raj,12, I can't watch anymore.,2,Big Bang Theory,23,4
7145,Leonard,12," Sheldon, we have to call it off.",2,Big Bang Theory,33,7
7146,Sheldon,12," We don't have that option, we've accepted the challenge. We can't run away from a fight.",2,Big Bang Theory,89,16
7147,Leonard,12," Oh, please, we've spent our whole lives running away from fights. Personally, I can squeeze through a hole in a fence half my size.",2,Big Bang Theory,132,24
7148,Sheldon,12," Impressive as that may be, Monte is not us. Monte has no fear.",2,Big Bang Theory,63,13
7149,Raj,12," Sheldon, did we all not just watch the same video? Kripke's robot just had angry sex with a mid-sized automobile.",2,Big Bang Theory,114,20
7150,Sheldon,12, You are overlooking the fact that we now know what we're up against and we can modify Monte so that he's prepared.,2,Big Bang Theory,115,22
7151,Leonard,12, You want to prepare him? Install a bladder and a pair of shorts so he can wet himself.,2,Big Bang Theory,87,18
7152,Raj,12," Excuse me, but how are we going to make any modifications without Wolowitz? Have you heard from Penny yet?",2,Big Bang Theory,107,19
7153,Leonard,12, Not yet.,2,Big Bang Theory,9,2
7154,Sheldon,12," Have faith, gentlemen. We don't need Wolowitz, engineering is merely the slow younger brother of physics. Watch and learn. Do either of you know how to open the toolbox?",2,Big Bang Theory,170,29
7156,Howard,12," And then, when I was 14, I met Marcy Grossman. She was so beautiful. She just got her braces off but they left a little of the overbite. It was so hot, like a sexy little chipmunk. I didn't have the courage to ask her out, but I dedicated a song to her at the ninth grade talent show.",2,Big Bang Theory,285,59
7157,Penny,12," Aw, that sounds sweet.",2,Big Bang Theory,23,4
7158,Howard,12," Marcy Grossman is sunshine, on a cloudy day, when it's cold outside, Marcy Grossman is the month of May",2,Big Bang Theory,104,19
7159,Penny,12," Oh, it's cute.",2,Big Bang Theory,15,3
7160,Howard,12," I guess you'd say, what can make me feel this way, Marcy Grossman, Marcy Grossman, Marcy Grossman, Talkin' 'bout Marcy",2,Big Bang Theory,119,20
7161,Penny,12, That's great.,2,Big Bang Theory,14,2
7162,Howard,12, Grossman.,2,Big Bang Theory,10,1
7163,Penny,12," Oh, it's fun.",2,Big Bang Theory,14,3
7164,Howard,12, And then she came up with that sexy little chipmunk mouth and spit in my hair. Which brings us to tenth grade.,2,Big Bang Theory,111,22
7165,Penny,12," Howard, do you think maybe sometimes you try too hard?",2,Big Bang Theory,55,10
7166,Howard,12, Look at me. What chance do I have if I don't try too hard?,2,Big Bang Theory,59,14
7167,Penny,12," Well, you'd have a terrific chance. I mean, you're smart, you're funny, you have a cool job. You build stuff that goes into outer space.",2,Big Bang Theory,137,25
7168,Howard,12, I guess.,2,Big Bang Theory,9,2
7169,Penny,12," Look, I'm telling you, I've known you for, like, a year and a half and this is the first time I feel like I'm talking to a real person. And you know what? I like him, he's a nice guy.",2,Big Bang Theory,184,40
7170,Howard,12, You really think so?,2,Big Bang Theory,21,4
7171,Penny,12, Yes.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
7172,Howard,12, I don't know.,2,Big Bang Theory,14,3
7173,Penny,12, I do. ,2,Big Bang Theory,7,2
7175,Leonard,12, Nice little bot you've got here.,2,Big Bang Theory,33,6
7177,Leonard,12," What's this do, spin?",2,Big Bang Theory,22,4
7179,Leonard,12," Neat. Good work. Sheldon, we've got to call this off.",2,Big Bang Theory,54,10
7180,Sheldon,12," No, Leonard. For years, merciless thugs like Kripke have made my life a series of painful noogies and humiliating wedgies and the insensitively named Indian burns. That stops now.",2,Big Bang Theory,180,29
7181,Raj,12," But, Sheldon, we don't have a chance. The only improvement you were able to make on the robot was to put fresh batteries in the remote.",2,Big Bang Theory,136,26
7182,Sheldon,12," What you fail to realize is Kripke suffers from a fatal flaw, overconfidence from his robot's massive size and its overwhelming power.",2,Big Bang Theory,135,22
7183,Raj,12," That's not overconfidence, that's observation.",2,Big Bang Theory,47,5
7184,Sheldon,12," Trust me, Kripke will fall easy prey to my psychological warfare. Observe. Kripke! I would ask if your robot is prepared to meet its maker, but as you are its maker, clearly the two of you have met.",2,Big Bang Theory,199,38
7186,Raj,12," Way to bust out the Jedi mind tricks, dude.",2,Big Bang Theory,44,9
7187,Leonard,12," I just want to make sure that we're all clear, standard robotic fighting league rules apply.",2,Big Bang Theory,93,16
7189,Sheldon,12," He's right, Leonard. The paradigm is to the death.",2,Big Bang Theory,51,9
7191,Sheldon,12, Never. I'd rather see Monte dead than in your hands.,2,Big Bang Theory,53,10
7193,Sheldon,12, Do it.,2,Big Bang Theory,7,2
7195,Raj,12," Come on, Sheldon, you got this.",2,Big Bang Theory,32,6
7196,Sheldon,12, Indeed. We are prepared for anything he can throw at us.  That's new.,2,Big Bang Theory,70,13
7197,Leonard,12," Run, Monte, run!",2,Big Bang Theory,17,3
7198,Raj,12," Go, Monte! Go Monte!",2,Big Bang Theory,21,4
7199,Leonard,12," Go, go, go, go!",2,Big Bang Theory,16,4
7200,Sheldon,12," Don't hurt us, don't hurt us,",2,Big Bang Theory,30,6
7202,Leonard,12," Well, so much for making up for the emotional wounds of childhood.",2,Big Bang Theory,67,12
7203,Sheldon,12," I did this. Monte was killed by my hubris and my pride. No matter what anybody says, this is my fault.",2,Big Bang Theory,103,21
7204,Raj,12," No one's arguing with you, dude.",2,Big Bang Theory,33,6
7205,Howard,12, I got your text. How bad is Oy.,2,Big Bang Theory,32,8
7206,Leonard,12, Forget the robot. What happened to you?,2,Big Bang Theory,40,7
7207,Penny,12, He slipped and fell.,2,Big Bang Theory,21,4
7208,Howard,12," Yes, I slipped and fell. In the bathroom. Bounced right off the tub.",2,Big Bang Theory,69,13
7209,Penny,12," Yes, now he knows what bathtubs are capable of doing when you don't treat them with respect.",2,Big Bang Theory,93,17
7210,Howard,12, Yeah. They sucker punch you when your eyes are closed.,2,Big Bang Theory,55,10
7211,Sheldon,12," So what do you think, Howard? It's not that bad, right?",2,Big Bang Theory,56,11
7212,Howard,12," Oh, no. A little electrical tape, some solder. Are you insane? I've seen space probes that crashed into the desert that were in better shape than this.",2,Big Bang Theory,152,27
7213,Sheldon,12," You're right. Monte's gone. We'll bury him in the morning. A simple ceremony. I'll speak. Leonard, you'll play your cello.",2,Big Bang Theory,123,20
7214,Penny,12," Sheldon, honey, aren't you getting a little carried away? I mean, it's just a toy robot.",2,Big Bang Theory,89,16
7215,Sheldon,12, Just a toy robot?,2,Big Bang Theory,18,4
7216,Leonard,12, Penny.,2,Big Bang Theory,7,1
7217,Penny,12," I know, I got it. Sheldon, I'm sorry.",2,Big Bang Theory,38,8
7218,Howard,12," Well, don't get the wrong idea. The way I see it, I'm halfway to pity sex.",2,Big Bang Theory,75,16
7220,Raj,13," Mmm, gentlemen, I put it to you, the worst tapioca pudding is better than the best pudding of any other flavour.",2,Big Bang Theory,113,21
7221,Sheldon,13," First off, that is axiomatically wrong, because the best pudding is chocolate. Secondly, the organic structure of tapioca makes it a jiggling bowl of potential death. It is extracted from the plant",2,Big Bang Theory,198,32
7222,Howard,13," Hey, I'm thinking of growing a mustache.",2,Big Bang Theory,41,7
7223,Leonard,13," Ah, no kidding! A Fu Man Chu? A handlebar pencil?",2,Big Bang Theory,50,10
7224,Sheldon,13, It is extracted from the plant,2,Big Bang Theory,31,6
7225,Howard,13," I'm not sure yet. You know, George Clooney has one now!",2,Big Bang Theory,56,11
7226,Raj,13, Really? I once saw him shopping at Ralph's. He was buying tequila.,2,Big Bang Theory,67,12
7227,Howard,13," Oh, you'd think a guy like that would have some kind of booze lackey.",2,Big Bang Theory,70,14
7228,Leonard,13," Alright this is cruel, we better let him finish before his head explodes.",2,Big Bang Theory,74,13
7229,Howard,13," Alright Sheldon, why is tapioca",2,Big Bang Theory,32,5
7230,Sheldon,13, Tapioca is extracted from the root of the plant Manihot Esculenta. Due to a high concentration of cyanide it is poisonous in its raw form and lethal if prepared improperly.,2,Big Bang Theory,173,30
7231,Raj,13, Feel better now?,2,Big Bang Theory,17,3
7232,Sheldon,13," It is also indigenous to Brazil, as is the Cocoa Bean, from which we get chocolate, the best pudding. And you promised you wouldn't do that anymore!",2,Big Bang Theory,149,27
7234,Leonard,13, Hey Kripke.,2,Big Bang Theory,12,2
7236,Howard,13, What a jerk.,2,Big Bang Theory,13,3
7237,Raj,13," Don't feel bad Leonard, negative results are still results.",2,Big Bang Theory,60,9
7238,Howard,13, Even twenty thousand of 'em.,2,Big Bang Theory,29,5
7239,Leonard,13," Alright, please don't cheer me up anymore.",2,Big Bang Theory,43,7
7240,Howard,13," C'mon, don't let him get to you. It's Kripke.",2,Big Bang Theory,46,9
7241,Raj,13," Yeah, he's a ginormous knob.",2,Big Bang Theory,29,5
7242,Howard,13," That's why he eats by himself, instead of sitting here at the cool table.",2,Big Bang Theory,74,14
7243,Raj,13, Fo' shizzle.,2,Big Bang Theory,13,2
7244,Sheldon,13," Hey it's true, Kripke lacks the basic social skills that we take for granted, but he also controls the new open science grid computer that I need to use to run some simulations of structure formation in the early universe.",2,Big Bang Theory,223,40
7245,Leonard,13, Good luck getting time on it. The only people he lets use it are his friends.,2,Big Bang Theory,78,16
7246,Sheldon,13," Well then, the solution is simple. I shall befriend him. Kripke!",2,Big Bang Theory,65,11
7248,Sheldon,13, What'd you say of the idea of you and I becoming friends?,2,Big Bang Theory,58,12
7250,Sheldon,13," Really? That seems rather short sighted, coming from someone who is generally considered altogether unlikable. Why don't you take some time to reconsider?",2,Big Bang Theory,155,23
7252,Sheldon,13, Well I think we're off to a terrific start.,2,Big Bang Theory,44,9
7254,Leonard,13, There you go. Now any e-mail from Wolowitz will go right into your spam folder.,2,Big Bang Theory,80,15
7255,Penny,13, Thanks! I mean the e-mail doesn't bother me as much as the vacation pictures of him in a bathing suit.,2,Big Bang Theory,103,20
7256,Leonard,13," Yeah, I got the same one. And that's not a bathing suit, it's a tan line.",2,Big Bang Theory,74,16
7257,Sheldon,13," Hello. This is Sheldon Cooper. I'm leaving a message for Barry Kripke. Barry, It was pleasant seeing you today in the cafeteria. I saw that you purchased the chef's salad. Apparently, you did not know that the chef's salad is kitchen trickery, to utilize scrap meat. Nevertheless, I hope you enjoyed it. I'm following up on our pending friendship, and I look forward to hearing from you regarding its status. Sheldon Cooper.",2,Big Bang Theory,425,72
7258,Penny,13, What's up with Ichabod?,2,Big Bang Theory,24,4
7259,Leonard,13, Oh he's trying to make a new friend.,2,Big Bang Theory,37,8
7260,Penny,13," Oh really? Well, good for him.",2,Big Bang Theory,31,6
7261,Leonard,13," Well, unless he's makes one out of wood like Gepetto, I don't think it's gonna happen.",2,Big Bang Theory,87,16
7262,Penny,13," Well, how did you guys become friends?",2,Big Bang Theory,39,7
7263,Leonard,13, There was a flier on the bulletin board at the university. Roommate wanted. Whistlers need not apply.,2,Big Bang Theory,102,17
7264,Penny,13, And you moved in anyway?,2,Big Bang Theory,25,5
7265,Leonard,13, I assumed he was joking. You'd be surprised how many particle physicists have a whimsical side.,2,Big Bang Theory,96,16
7266,Penny,13," Well, what about Howard and Raj, I mean how did you become friends with them?",2,Big Bang Theory,78,15
7267,Leonard,13," I don't know, how do carbon atoms form a benzene ring? Proximity and valence electrons.",2,Big Bang Theory,88,15
7268,Penny,13," Well yeah, sure. When you put it that way. But it all worked out, right?",2,Big Bang Theory,73,15
7269,Leonard,13, I suppose. I do miss whistling though.,2,Big Bang Theory,39,7
7270,Penny,13," Oh come on, really? ",2,Big Bang Theory,21,4
7271,Sheldon,13, First warning.,2,Big Bang Theory,15,2
7274,Penny,13, Hello Sheldon.,2,Big Bang Theory,15,2
7275,Sheldon,13, Hi.,2,Big Bang Theory,4,1
7276,Penny,13, What is this?,2,Big Bang Theory,14,3
7277,Sheldon,13," It's a questionnaire I devised. I'm having some difficulty bonding with a colleague at work, so I'm doing a little research to better understand why my current friends like me.",2,Big Bang Theory,177,30
7278,Penny,13," Yes. Well, that is a good question. But is this really the best way to figure it out?",2,Big Bang Theory,86,18
7279,Sheldon,13," Yeah, I agree, the social sciences are largely hokum. But, short of putting electrodes in your brain and monitoring your response to my companionship, this is the best I can do.",2,Big Bang Theory,178,31
7280,Penny,13," Okay, question 1. Rank the following aspects of Sheldon Cooper in order of appeal. Intelligence. Ruthless attention to hygiene. Playfulness. Java applet writing?",2,Big Bang Theory,162,23
7281,Sheldon,13," I know, I may have started off with a fairly obvious one. You did an aspect of my most appealing trait, playfulness. Why don't you just go ahead and write that number 1. I'm afraid you're on your own for the rest. It should take you no more than 3 hours.",2,Big Bang Theory,255,51
7282,Penny,13, Wait! How many questions are on this thing?,2,Big Bang Theory,44,8
7283,Sheldon,13," Only 211. Don't worry, in deference to you, I've kept them on a high school graduate reading level.",2,Big Bang Theory,100,18
7284,Penny,13, Thanks pal.,2,Big Bang Theory,12,2
7285,Sheldon,13," You got it, buddy.",2,Big Bang Theory,19,4
7286,Penny,13," Sheldon honey, did you ever consider making friends by being, I don't know, pleasant?",2,Big Bang Theory,86,14
7287,Sheldon,13, Well that's certainly a thought-provoking hypothesis. May I suggest it as the topic for your essay.,2,Big Bang Theory,100,16
7289,Sheldon,13," Your questionnaire, very disappointing.",2,Big Bang Theory,40,4
7290,Leonard,13, I answered every question Sheldon.,2,Big Bang Theory,35,5
7291,Sheldon,13, You answered the multiple choice questions in a pattern. A B B A C. A B B A C.,2,Big Bang Theory,79,19
7292,Leonard,13," Aw, you picked up on that huh?",2,Big Bang Theory,31,7
7293,Sheldon,13, How could I not?,2,Big Bang Theory,17,4
7294,Leonard,13," Come on! There's over 200 questions. And look at some of these things. Sheldon is to camaraderie, as the space shuttle is to blank?",2,Big Bang Theory,132,24
7295,Leonard,13, Hold on. I put some real work into that!,2,Big Bang Theory,41,9
7296,Sheldon,13," Yes, well it's better than what Wolowitz did. He drew a raccoon with what appears to be, a distended scrotum.",2,Big Bang Theory,110,20
7297,Leonard,13," It's kinda cute, until you get to the scrotum.",2,Big Bang Theory,47,9
7298,Sheldon,13, What hope do I have for establishing new relationships given that my current friends apparently cannot take a few hours out of their lives to help me?,2,Big Bang Theory,151,27
7299,Leonard,13," Sheldon, I'm not going to defend a big-balled raccoon.",2,Big Bang Theory,55,9
7300,Sheldon,13, I don't see how you could.,2,Big Bang Theory,27,6
7301,Leonard,13," What I'm trying to say is that, maybe you can't approach this as a purely intellectual exercise.",2,Big Bang Theory,97,17
7302,Sheldon,13, What do you mean!?,2,Big Bang Theory,19,4
7303,Leonard,13," Well, remember when you tried to learn how to swim using the internet?",2,Big Bang Theory,71,13
7304,Sheldon,13, I did learn how to swim.,2,Big Bang Theory,25,6
7305,Leonard,13, On the floor.,2,Big Bang Theory,14,3
7306,Sheldon,13, The skills are transferrable. I just have no interest in going in the water.,2,Big Bang Theory,77,14
7307,Leonard,13, Then why learn how to swim?,2,Big Bang Theory,28,6
7308,Sheldon,13," The ice caps are melting Leonard. In the future, swimming isn't going to be optional. But you do bring up an interesting point. I don't have to break new ground here, I'm sure much of the research already exists.",2,Big Bang Theory,213,39
7309,Leonard,13," No! no, my point is, if you want to learn how to make friends, then just go out to a coffee shop or a museum. Meet people. Talk to them. Take an interest in their lives.",2,Big Bang Theory,170,36
7310,Sheldon,13, That's insane on the face of it. Come on.,2,Big Bang Theory,42,9
7311,Leonard,13, Where are we going?,2,Big Bang Theory,20,4
7312,Sheldon,13, You're driving me to the mall. I'm going to acquire a book that summarizes the current theories in the field of friendmaking.,2,Big Bang Theory,126,22
7313,Leonard,13, Why don't you just lie down on the floor and swim there?,2,Big Bang Theory,57,12
7315,Sheldon,13, Coping with the death of a loved one. My condolences.,2,Big Bang Theory,54,10
7317,Sheldon,13, Family or friend?,2,Big Bang Theory,18,3
7319,Sheldon,13," Too bad. If it'd been a friend, I'm available to fill the void.  It's just as well, she smelled like moth balls.",2,Big Bang Theory,113,22
7320,Leonard,13," Okay, if you're gonna start sniffing people, I'm gonna go get a hot pretzel.",2,Big Bang Theory,77,14
7321,Sheldon,13, Excuse me. Do you have any books about making friends?,2,Big Bang Theory,55,10
7323,Sheldon,13, I assume the skills can be extrapolated and transferred.,2,Big Bang Theory,57,9
7325,Sheldon,13, Oh! I love trains!,2,Big Bang Theory,19,4
7327,Sheldon,13," Oh my! That's awfully sticky. Alright, let's see. Bernie Bunny has Two Daddies Now. It's probably about homosexual rabbits. Jerry the Gerbil and the Bullies on the Bus. Read it, not helpful. Oh! Here we go. Stu the Cockatoo is New at the Zoo. Author Sarah Carpenter lives in Fort Wayne, Indiana, with her husband and best friend Mark, and their cockatoos too. Hardly makes her an expert in making friends, wouldn't you agree?",2,Big Bang Theory,426,74
7329,Sheldon,13, Me too! Most people don't see it. What are you reading?,2,Big Bang Theory,56,11
7331,Sheldon,13, Oh I do like monkeys!,2,Big Bang Theory,22,5
7333,Sheldon,13," Somewhat anthropomorphized but yes. Say, maybe sometime you and I can go see monkeys together. Would you like that?",2,Big Bang Theory,116,19
7335,Leonard,13," Sheldon, what are you doing?",2,Big Bang Theory,29,5
7336,Sheldon,13, I'm making friends with this little girl. What's your name?,2,Big Bang Theory,60,10
7338,Sheldon,13," Hi Rebecca, I'm your new friend, Sheldon.",2,Big Bang Theory,42,7
7339,Leonard,13," No you're not, let's go.",2,Big Bang Theory,25,5
7340,Sheldon,13, We were really hitting it off.,2,Big Bang Theory,31,6
7341,Leonard,13," Don't look up, there's cameras.",2,Big Bang Theory,32,5
7343,Raj,13," I'm curious. In the â€œHow Well Do You Know Sheldonâ€ù section, what do you put for his favourite amino acid?",2,Big Bang Theory,110,20
7345,Raj,13, Damn it. I had Lysine and changed it.,2,Big Bang Theory,38,8
7346,Sheldon,13, Oh good! You're just in time. I believe I've isolated the algorithm for making friends.,2,Big Bang Theory,88,15
7347,Leonard,13," Sheldon, there is no algorithm for making friends!",2,Big Bang Theory,51,8
7348,Howard,13," Hear him out. If he's really on to something, we can open a booth at Comic-Con, make a fortune.",2,Big Bang Theory,96,19
7349,Sheldon,13," See, my initial approach to Kripke, had the same deficiencies as those that plagued Stu the Cockatoo, when he was new at the zoo.",2,Big Bang Theory,130,24
7350,Raj,13, Stu the cockatoo?,2,Big Bang Theory,18,3
7351,Leonard,13," Yes, he's new at the zoo.",2,Big Bang Theory,26,6
7352,Sheldon,13, It's a terrific book. I've distilled its essence into a simple flowchart that would guide me through the process.,2,Big Bang Theory,114,19
7353,Howard,13, Have you thought about putting him in a crate while you're out of the apartment?,2,Big Bang Theory,81,15
7354,Sheldon,13," Hello, Kripke. Yes, Sheldon Cooper here. It occurred to me you hadn't returned any of my calls because I hadn't offered any concrete suggestions for pursuing our friendship. Perhaps the two of us might share a meal together I see. Well then perhaps you'd have time for a hot beverage. Popular choices include tea, coffee, cocoa I see. No, no, no, wait. Don't hang up yet. What about a recreational activity? I bet we share some common interests. Tell me an interest of yours. Really? On actual horses? Tell me another interest of yours. Oh no, I'm sorry, I have no desire to get in the water until I absolutely have to. Tell me another interest of yours.",2,Big Bang Theory,655,118
7355,Leonard,13," Uh-oh, he's stuck in an infinite loop.",2,Big Bang Theory,39,7
7356,Howard,13, I can fix it.,2,Big Bang Theory,14,4
7357,Sheldon,13," Mmhmm. Mmhmm. It's interesting. But isn't ventriloquism, by definition, a solo activity? Yeah? Tell me another interest of yours. Hmmm. Is there any chance you like monkeys? What is wrong with you? Everybody likes monkeys. Hang on, Kripke.  A loop counter? And an escape to the least objectionable activity! Howard, that's brilliant! I'm surprised you saw that.",2,Big Bang Theory,362,57
7358,Howard,13, Gee. Why can't Sheldon make friends?,2,Big Bang Theory,37,6
7359,Sheldon,13," Alright Kripke, that last interest strikes me as the least objectionable and I would like to propose that we do that together. Tomorrow. Yes, I'll pay. Alright, goodbye. Alright! Time to learn rock climbing.",2,Big Bang Theory,208,34
7361,Sheldon,13," You know, I am a fan of ventriloquism. Maybe you, me and your dummy could go get a hot beverage. He could talk while you drink.",2,Big Bang Theory,128,26
7363,Sheldon,13," This appears significantly more monolithic than it did on my laptop. No, one expects to see Hominids learning to use bones as weapeons.",2,Big Bang Theory,136,23
7365,Sheldon,13," Hardly. Fear of heights is illogical. Fear of falling, on the other hand, is prudent and evolutionary. What would you say is the minimum altitude I need to achieve to cement our new-found friendship?",2,Big Bang Theory,200,34
7367,Sheldon,13," Little kid Hominids, perhaps.  Is this your entire job? Your parents must be so proud.",2,Big Bang Theory,87,15
7369,Sheldon,13," Coming, Kripke. Okay. Harness seems to be secure. Small amount of incontinence just now, but the website said that's to be expected. Hey, this isn't so bad. A bit like vertical swimming.",2,Big Bang Theory,187,32
7371,Sheldon,13, I am? I was wrong. It IS a fear of heights.,2,Big Bang Theory,44,11
7373,Sheldon,13, Not really. I feel somewhat like an inverse tangent function that's approaching an asymptote.,2,Big Bang Theory,94,14
7375,Sheldon,13, What part of an inverse tangent function approaching an asymptote did you not understand?,2,Big Bang Theory,90,14
7377,Sheldon,13," Yeah, I don't think I can.",2,Big Bang Theory,27,6
7379,Sheldon,13," No, that doesn't seem any more likely.",2,Big Bang Theory,39,7
7381,Sheldon,13," Well, it's not exactly a plan but I think I'm going to pass out.",2,Big Bang Theory,65,14
7383,Leonard,13, I'm sorry. Can we please just do it one more time?,2,Big Bang Theory,51,11
7384,Howard,13," Okay. 1, 2, 1, 2, 3 and ",2,Big Bang Theory,25,7
7385,Leonard,13, It's a little thing but you really do miss it.,2,Big Bang Theory,47,10
7386,Sheldon,13," Hello, everyone. I brought my new friend, Barry Kripke, home for dinner.",2,Big Bang Theory,73,12
7389,Leonard,13, How was rock climbing?,2,Big Bang Theory,23,4
7391,Sheldon,13, D-d-d! That's where I sit.,2,Big Bang Theory,27,5
7393,Howard,13, How much time you got?,2,Big Bang Theory,23,5
7394,Leonard,13, Want some Chinese food?,2,Big Bang Theory,24,4
7396,Leonard,13, In the bathroom.,2,Big Bang Theory,17,3
7398,Penny,13," Sheldon, are you okay?",2,Big Bang Theory,23,4
7399,Sheldon,13," Oh yes, I pass out all the time. But, it was worth it. I've made substantial progress in bonding with Kripke, which brings me to an awkward moment.",2,Big Bang Theory,148,28
7400,Leonard,13, What's that?,2,Big Bang Theory,13,2
7401,Sheldon,13," Maintaining five friendships promises to be a Herculean task. So, I'm going to have to let one of you go.",2,Big Bang Theory,106,20
7402,Howard,13," Me, me. Let it be me.",2,Big Bang Theory,22,6
7403,Sheldon,13," Leonard, you are my roommate, my source of transportation and you help me fold my sheets when they come out of the dryer. You are safe.",2,Big Bang Theory,136,26
7404,Leonard,13, Can I whistle?,2,Big Bang Theory,15,3
7405,Sheldon,13," Don't be silly. Howard, you do not have a PhD, your cologne is an assault on the senses and you're not available for video games during the Jewish high holidays.",2,Big Bang Theory,162,30
7406,Howard,13, Guilty as charged. I'm out.,2,Big Bang Theory,28,5
7407,Sheldon,13," No. You, too, are safe.",2,Big Bang Theory,24,5
7408,Howard,13, Oh come on. What do I have to do?,2,Big Bang Theory,34,9
7409,Penny,13, Okay. You know what? I see where this is going. I'm not one of you guys. I'm not a scientist. So just,2,Big Bang Theory,102,22
7410,Sheldon,13," Penny, Penny, Penny. Everything you're saying is true, but please allow me to continue. Raj, you're out. The good question, while you do provide a certain cultural diversity to an otherwise homogenous group, your responses to the questionnaire were truly disturbing. How could you, for a moment, think that my favourite amino acid is Glutamine?",2,Big Bang Theory,345,55
7411,Leonard,13, He had Lysine but changed it.,2,Big Bang Theory,30,6
7412,Sheldon,13," Yeah. Shoulda, woulda coulda, Raj.",2,Big Bang Theory,35,5
7414,Penny,13, Eww.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
7416,Penny,13, Penny.,2,Big Bang Theory,7,1
7418,Howard,13," Suddenly I'm looking pretty good, huh?",2,Big Bang Theory,39,6
7419,Sheldon,13," So uh, Kripke, I was wondering if there's any chance you could get me some time on the open science grid computer.",2,Big Bang Theory,115,22
7421,Sheldon,13, No? But we're friends!,2,Big Bang Theory,23,4
7423,Sheldon,13, I'm confused. I was given an understanding that you allow your friends time on the machine?,2,Big Bang Theory,92,16
7425,Sheldon,13," Oh. This entire endeavour seems to have been an exercise in futility. Raj, you're back in. He likes monkeys.",2,Big Bang Theory,109,19
7427,Howard,13, You gotta give him credit for sticking with it.,2,Big Bang Theory,48,9
7428,Leonard,13, I didn't think he had it in him.,2,Big Bang Theory,33,8
7429,Raj,13, He almost made it to the top this time.,2,Big Bang Theory,40,9
7431,Leonard,14, Hmmm.,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
7432,Sheldon,14, The problem appears to be unsolvable.,2,Big Bang Theory,38,6
7433,Raj,14, Maybe you could run some computer simulations.,2,Big Bang Theory,47,7
7434,Howard,14, There are too many variables. It would take forever.,2,Big Bang Theory,53,9
7435,Sheldon,14," Right, these theatres have to be eliminated.",2,Big Bang Theory,45,7
7436,Leonard,14," Why? They're state-of-the-art digital projection, 20-channel surround sound.",2,Big Bang Theory,77,8
7437,Sheldon,14," Yes, but they have no Icee machines. Despite my aggressive letter-writing campaign, I might add.",2,Big Bang Theory,97,15
7438,Raj,14, What about the multiplex here? The seats are terrific.,2,Big Bang Theory,55,9
7439,Sheldon,14, They have Twizzlers instead of Red Vines. No amount of lumbar support can compensate for that.,2,Big Bang Theory,95,16
7440,Leonard,14," Well, it's gonna take at least an hour to eat, and I don't see a Sheldon-approved restaurant proximate to a Sheldon-approved theatre.",2,Big Bang Theory,134,22
7441,Raj,14, We could eat after the movie.,2,Big Bang Theory,30,6
7442,Sheldon,14," Unacceptable, the delay would result in tomorrow morning's bowel movement occurring at work.",2,Big Bang Theory,93,13
7443,Raj,14," Hang on, hang on. There's a 7-Eleven here. We smuggle Slurpies, which are essentially Icees, in under our coats, after having a pleasant meal either here, here or here.",2,Big Bang Theory,169,29
7444,Howard,14, Wow. I don't see how we missed that.,2,Big Bang Theory,37,8
7445,Sheldon,14," Excuse me, in what universe are Slurpies Icees?",2,Big Bang Theory,48,8
7446,Raj,14, That's how we missed it.,2,Big Bang Theory,25,5
7447,Leonard,14," Sheldon, would you be prepared, on a non-precedential basis, to create an emergency ad-hoc Slurpie-Icee equivalency?",2,Big Bang Theory,117,16
7448,Sheldon,14," Oh, Leonard, you know I can't do that.",2,Big Bang Theory,39,8
7449,Howard,14," Okay, I guess we only have one option.",2,Big Bang Theory,39,8
7450,Raj,14," Yep, I don't see any way around it.",2,Big Bang Theory,36,8
7451,Leonard,14," Bye, Sheldon.",2,Big Bang Theory,14,2
7452,Howard,14, See ya.,2,Big Bang Theory,8,2
7453,Raj,14," Later, dude.",2,Big Bang Theory,13,2
7454,Sheldon,14," They're right, it was the only option.",2,Big Bang Theory,39,7
7456,Penny,14," Ooh, ooh, shut the door, shut the door.",2,Big Bang Theory,40,8
7457,Sheldon,14, Why?,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
7458,Penny,14, Just do it!  Get inside and shut the door.,2,Big Bang Theory,43,9
7459,Sheldon,14," Well, you didn't specify.",2,Big Bang Theory,26,4
7460,Penny,14, Is Leonard around?,2,Big Bang Theory,19,3
7461,Sheldon,14," He went to the movies without me. It was the only option. I'm sorry, I don't understand which social situation this is. Could you give me some guidance as to how to proceed?",2,Big Bang Theory,174,33
7462,Penny,14," The building manager's showing an apartment downstairs, and I haven't paid my rent.",2,Big Bang Theory,84,13
7463,Sheldon,14," Oh, I see. Penny, I'm not sure I'm comfortable harbouring a fugitive from the 2311 North Los Robles Corporation.",2,Big Bang Theory,113,19
7464,Penny,14, It's no big deal. I'm just a little behind on my bills because they cut back my hours at the restaurant and my car broke down.,2,Big Bang Theory,127,26
7465,Sheldon,14," If you recall, I pointed out the â€œcheck engineâ€ù light to you several months ago.",2,Big Bang Theory,85,15
7466,Penny,14, Well the â€œcheck engineâ€ù light is fine. It's still blinking away. It's the stupid engine that stopped working. It cost me like twelve hundred dollars to fix it.,2,Big Bang Theory,164,28
7467,Sheldon,14," You know, it occurs to me you could solve all your problems by obtaining more money.",2,Big Bang Theory,85,16
7468,Penny,14," Yes, it occurs to me, too.",2,Big Bang Theory,27,6
7469,Sheldon,14, Hang on a moment.  Here. Take some. Pay me back when you can.,2,Big Bang Theory,62,13
7470,Penny,14," Wow, you got a lot of money in there.",2,Big Bang Theory,38,9
7471,Sheldon,14, That's why it's guarded by snakes. Take some.,2,Big Bang Theory,46,8
7472,Penny,14, Don't be silly.,2,Big Bang Theory,16,3
7473,Sheldon,14, I'm never silly. Here.,2,Big Bang Theory,23,4
7474,Penny,14," No, I can't.",2,Big Bang Theory,13,3
7475,Sheldon,14, Don't you need money?,2,Big Bang Theory,22,4
7476,Penny,14," Well, yeah, but",2,Big Bang Theory,16,3
7477,Sheldon,14, This is money I'm not using.,2,Big Bang Theory,29,6
7478,Penny,14, But what if you need it?,2,Big Bang Theory,25,6
7479,Sheldon,14," My expenses account for 46.9% of my after-tax income. The rest is divvied up between a small savings account, this deceptive container of peanut brittle and the hollowed-out buttocks of a superhero action figure who shall remain nameless for his own protection. Or her own protection. Take some.",2,Big Bang Theory,296,48
7480,Penny,14," Really? I mean, are you sure?",2,Big Bang Theory,30,6
7481,Sheldon,14, I see no large upcoming expenditures unless they develop an affordable technology to fuse my skeleton with adamantium like Wolverine.,2,Big Bang Theory,134,20
7482,Penny,14, Are they working on that?,2,Big Bang Theory,26,5
7483,Sheldon,14, I sincerely hope so.,2,Big Bang Theory,21,4
7484,Penny,14," Okay. Well, thank you. Oh, God, no, I can't. Sheldon honey, I don't want things to be weird between us.",2,Big Bang Theory,104,20
7485,Sheldon,14, Won't it also be weird if I have to say hello to you every morning on my way to work and you're living in a refrigerator box and washing your hair with rain water?,2,Big Bang Theory,164,34
7486,Penny,14, I'll pay you back as soon as I can.,2,Big Bang Theory,36,9
7487,Sheldon,14, Of course you will. It's impossible to pay me back sooner than you can. Assuming you subscribe to a linear understanding of time and causality.,2,Big Bang Theory,144,25
7488,Penny,14, I'm regretting this already.,2,Big Bang Theory,29,4
7490,Sheldon,14," You know, I've given the matter some thought, and I think I'd be willing to be a house pet to a race of super-intelligent aliens.",2,Big Bang Theory,130,25
7491,Leonard,14, Interesting.,2,Big Bang Theory,13,1
7492,Sheldon,14, Ask me why.,2,Big Bang Theory,12,3
7493,Leonard,14, Do I have to?,2,Big Bang Theory,14,4
7494,Sheldon,14, Of course. That's how you move a conversation forward.,2,Big Bang Theory,55,9
7495,Leonard,14, Why?,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
7496,Sheldon,14," The learning opportunities would be abundant. Additionally, I like having my belly scratched.",2,Big Bang Theory,94,13
7497,Leonard,14," Hey, Penny. How was work?",2,Big Bang Theory,26,5
7498,Penny,14, Great. I hope I'm a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory for my whole life.,2,Big Bang Theory,74,14
7499,Sheldon,14, Was that sarcasm?,2,Big Bang Theory,18,3
7500,Penny,14, No.,2,Big Bang Theory,4,1
7501,Sheldon,14, Was that sarcasm?,2,Big Bang Theory,18,3
7502,Penny,14, Yes.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
7503,Sheldon,14, Was that sarca..,2,Big Bang Theory,17,3
7504,Leonard,14, Stop it!,2,Big Bang Theory,9,2
7505,Sheldon,14," Penny, you appear to have a package here.",2,Big Bang Theory,42,8
7506,Penny,14," Oh, thanks. This must be the beret I ordered. A couple of months ago. It was back-ordered.",2,Big Bang Theory,91,17
7507,Sheldon,14, Did you know the beret is an example of piece of women's fashion adapted from male military uniforms? Another fascinating example is the epaulet.,2,Big Bang Theory,146,24
7508,Leonard,14," He's not lying, he does find that fascinating.",2,Big Bang Theory,47,8
7509,Penny,14," Okay, whatever. It's not like I'm running up and down the streets just buying myself berets. I bought one, like, a month ago, and it was back-ordered, look, it finally arrived, all right?",2,Big Bang Theory,188,33
7510,Sheldon,14, All right.,2,Big Bang Theory,11,2
7511,Penny,14," Oh, my God, would you just get off my case?",2,Big Bang Theory,44,10
7512,Leonard,14, Weird.,2,Big Bang Theory,7,1
7513,Sheldon,14," Oh, good, that was an unusual interaction. I wasn't sure.",2,Big Bang Theory,58,10
7514,Leonard,14, Did you guys have an argument?,2,Big Bang Theory,31,6
7515,Sheldon,14, No.,2,Big Bang Theory,4,1
7516,Leonard,14," Well, you clearly did something to aggravate her.",2,Big Bang Theory,50,8
7517,Sheldon,14," I'm at a loss. If you like, you can review my daily log of social interactions and see if there's a blunder I overlooked.",2,Big Bang Theory,122,24
7519,Leonard,14," Here you go. Oh, you owe me another two dollars. The price of mu-shu pork went up.",2,Big Bang Theory,83,17
7520,Howard,14, It's getting tougher and tougher to be a bad Jew.,2,Big Bang Theory,50,10
7521,Leonard,14," Here you go, Penny. Shrimp with lobster sauce.",2,Big Bang Theory,47,8
7522,Penny,14," Thank you, Leonard. What's my share?",2,Big Bang Theory,37,6
7523,Leonard,14, Don't worry about it. It's my treat.,2,Big Bang Theory,37,7
7524,Penny,14," No, really, how much?",2,Big Bang Theory,22,4
7525,Leonard,14," It's, whatever. Ten, eleven dollars.",2,Big Bang Theory,37,5
7526,Penny,14," Well, which is it, ten or eleven?",2,Big Bang Theory,34,7
7527,Leonard,14," Fourteen fifty, but it's no biggie, you'll get the next one. ",2,Big Bang Theory,62,11
7528,Penny,14, What?,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
7529,Howard,14, He was just wondering if he wore skintight jeans and a tank top if he'd get his shrimp lo mein for free.,2,Big Bang Theory,105,22
7530,Penny,14, What are you saying? That I'm using my body to get dinner? That I'm some kind of Chinese food prostitute?,2,Big Bang Theory,106,20
7531,Howard,14," Yeah, Raj, what are you saying?",2,Big Bang Theory,32,6
7532,Penny,14," â€˜Cause let me tell you something, buddy, I pay my own way in this world, okay? I don't rely on anybody!  What was that about?",2,Big Bang Theory,128,25
7533,Howard,14, He has a nervous bladder when he's stressed out. Kind of like a puppy.,2,Big Bang Theory,71,14
7534,Penny,14," Here, Leonard, ten, eleven, twelve, uh, fourteen dollars.",2,Big Bang Theory,58,8
7535,Leonard,14," It was fourteen fifty, but it's okay.",2,Big Bang Theory,38,7
7536,Sheldon,14," Oh, good. Dinner's here.",2,Big Bang Theory,25,4
7537,Penny,14," Yes, dinner's here, and I'm having some. I'm having takeout food.",2,Big Bang Theory,66,11
7538,Sheldon,14, Okay.,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
7539,Penny,14," You're damn right it's okay. I've been having leftovers at the restaurant for like four days, and I wanted something different. So sue me.",2,Big Bang Theory,139,24
7540,Sheldon,14," Forgive me, Penny, but that would be the very definition of a frivolous lawsuit.",2,Big Bang Theory,81,14
7541,Penny,14," Sheldon, look, I will pay you back as soon as I can. You just have to give me more time.",2,Big Bang Theory,89,20
7542,Leonard,14," Oh, wait, you lent her money?",2,Big Bang Theory,30,6
7543,Penny,14, She needed money. You seem under pressure. Did I not lend you a sufficient amount? Because I can give you more.,2,Big Bang Theory,112,21
7544,Penny,14," Oh, you know, you would just love that, wouldn't you? Yeah. You would just love to open up your little snake can and throw some money at the girl who can't pay her bills.",2,Big Bang Theory,171,34
7545,Leonard,14, Where are you going?,2,Big Bang Theory,21,4
7546,Penny,14," Going home, where I won't be interrogated like a criminal. I forgot my fortune cookie.",2,Big Bang Theory,87,15
7547,Sheldon,14," In case either of you have larceny in your heart, you should know that I've moved my money out of the snake can.",2,Big Bang Theory,113,23
7548,Leonard,14," But if you're ever short, there's always a couple of fifties in Green Lantern's ass.",2,Big Bang Theory,85,15
7550,Leonard,14, Hey.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
7551,Penny,14, Hey.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
7552,Leonard,14," A little mood lighting, huh?",2,Big Bang Theory,29,5
7553,Penny,14," Yeah. When I didn't pay my bill, the Department of Water and Power thought I would enjoy the ambience.",2,Big Bang Theory,103,19
7554,Leonard,14," Yeah, they're very considerate that way.",2,Big Bang Theory,41,6
7555,Penny,14," I used Sheldon's money to pay my rent, then I had like fourteen dollars left over.",2,Big Bang Theory,83,16
7556,Leonard,14," Fourteen dollars, huh?",2,Big Bang Theory,23,3
7557,Penny,14," Put it back in your pocket, or I'll find some other place to put it.",2,Big Bang Theory,69,15
7558,Leonard,14," Back in the pocket it goes. Look, you do understand that Sheldon really doesn't care when he gets the money back. It's actually one of the few idiosyncrasies that doesn't make you want to, you know, kill him.",2,Big Bang Theory,209,38
7559,Penny,14," Yeah, well, that's not really my big problem.",2,Big Bang Theory,46,8
7560,Leonard,14, So you're a little behind on your bills. Everybody gets behind on their bills.,2,Big Bang Theory,79,14
7561,Penny,14," Yeah, I know, it's just, this wasn't the plan, it wasn't supposed to go this way.",2,Big Bang Theory,82,16
7562,Leonard,14," Well, what was the plan?",2,Big Bang Theory,25,5
7563,Penny,14," Um, waitress for six months and then become a movie star.",2,Big Bang Theory,58,11
7564,Leonard,14, Was there a plan B?,2,Big Bang Theory,20,5
7565,Penny,14, TV star.,2,Big Bang Theory,9,2
7566,Leonard,14," It's probably not as bad as you think. Let's take a look. Maybe we can find some corners to cut. Oh, here's something, if you don't have electricity, then you probably don't need cable. Just a suggestion. 170 dollars for acting classes?",2,Big Bang Theory,237,42
7567,Penny,14," Oh, no, I can't give up my acting classes. I'm a professional actress.",2,Big Bang Theory,71,13
7568,Leonard,14, You've had an acting job where you got paid?,2,Big Bang Theory,45,9
7569,Penny,14, That is not the definition of professional.,2,Big Bang Theory,44,7
7570,Leonard,14," Actually, it kind of let's keep looking. Whoa, what's eighteen hundred dollars to the Los Angeles County Superior Court?",2,Big Bang Theory,121,19
7571,Penny,14," Oh, that's nothing.",2,Big Bang Theory,20,3
7572,Leonard,14," Nothing? It sounds like you got caught speeding going 4,000 miles an hour.",2,Big Bang Theory,75,13
7573,Penny,14," Well, remember Kurt?",2,Big Bang Theory,21,3
7574,Leonard,14, Your ex-boyfriend?,2,Big Bang Theory,19,2
7575,Penny,14, Yeah. He got arrested for taking a whiz on a cop car.,2,Big Bang Theory,54,12
7576,Leonard,14, What?,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
7577,Penny,14, He was drunk.,2,Big Bang Theory,14,3
7578,Leonard,14, I would hope so.,2,Big Bang Theory,17,4
7579,Penny,14," Anyway, he had a bunch of outstanding tickets and a bench warrant, so I, you know, I paid his fines.",2,Big Bang Theory,101,20
7580,Leonard,14, Did he pay you back?,2,Big Bang Theory,21,5
7581,Penny,14," No, but he will.",2,Big Bang Theory,17,4
7582,Leonard,14, And that's based on the inherent credit-worthiness of people who get drunk and urinate on police vehicles?,2,Big Bang Theory,107,17
7583,Penny,14," Leonard, I'm not gonna call up Kurt and ask him for money.",2,Big Bang Theory,59,12
7584,Leonard,14, Well what are you gonna do?,2,Big Bang Theory,28,6
7585,Penny,14," I don't know, but I may have to find a cheaper place to live.",2,Big Bang Theory,62,14
7586,Leonard,14," Oh, no. Oh, you don't want to do that.",2,Big Bang Theory,39,9
7587,Penny,14, Why not?,2,Big Bang Theory,9,2
7588,Leonard,14," Well, moving is a big deal. You have to go to the supermarket and get boxes, and if they're not clean, then your books smell like melons, and it's just, like Why don't you just get a roommate and stay here?",2,Big Bang Theory,207,41
7589,Penny,14," Well, do you know anybody?",2,Big Bang Theory,27,5
7590,Leonard,14," Well, I'm sure the guy living with Sheldon wouldn't mind moving in with you.",2,Big Bang Theory,77,14
7591,Penny,14," Oh, Leonard, honey, if we started living together, I wouldn't be able to keep my hands off you.",2,Big Bang Theory,96,18
7592,Leonard,14, Really?,2,Big Bang Theory,8,1
7593,Penny,14, And you thought my acting lessons were a waste of money.,2,Big Bang Theory,57,11
7595,Howard,14, Ugh. This mu-shu pork's burning a hole through my duodenum.,2,Big Bang Theory,60,10
7596,Howard,14," Hey, do I mock you with the Bhagavad-Gita every time you scarf down a Whopper?",2,Big Bang Theory,79,15
7597,Leonard,14," Hey, what's going on?",2,Big Bang Theory,22,4
7598,Raj,14, We're on a quest through the Valley of Fire to acquire the sacred crown.,2,Big Bang Theory,73,14
7599,Howard,14, You want the Valley of Fire? It's right here.,2,Big Bang Theory,46,9
7600,Leonard,14," Hey, you guys want to go on a real live quest?",2,Big Bang Theory,47,11
7601,Sheldon,14, Outside? I just made cocoa.,2,Big Bang Theory,28,5
7602,Leonard,14, â€“ Come on. It'll be fun.,2,Big Bang Theory,27,6
7603,Howard,14, What is it?,2,Big Bang Theory,12,3
7604,Leonard,14," Do you guys remember Penny's ex-boyfriend Kurt?  Yeah, that's him. It turns out he owes Penny a lot of money, and I'm gonna go get it from him.",2,Big Bang Theory,144,28
7605,Howard,14," Ooh, double sixes.",2,Big Bang Theory,19,3
7606,Leonard,14, Really? You're just gonna let me go by myself?,2,Big Bang Theory,47,9
7607,Raj,14," Oh, cool, I got a sword.",2,Big Bang Theory,25,6
7608,Leonard,14, I could use some help.,2,Big Bang Theory,23,5
7609,Raj,14, Here.,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
7610,Leonard,14," You guys are unbelievable, you play a game to simulate adventure, but when there's real adventure out there in the real world, you just wimp out.",2,Big Bang Theory,146,26
7611,Sheldon,14," Leonard, do you not recall the last time we visited this gentleman, we returned home without pants?",2,Big Bang Theory,100,17
7612,Leonard,14, I do.,2,Big Bang Theory,6,2
7613,Sheldon,14, Are you sure? Because your proposal suggests that you don't.,2,Big Bang Theory,61,10
7614,Leonard,14, I'm not afraid of him.,2,Big Bang Theory,23,5
7615,Sheldon,14," All right. Leonard fairly calls the question, who is in favour of abandoning our game and confronting Penny's steroid-infused ex-boyfriend in a suicidal mission to extract money from him? Say hi to Kurt for us.",2,Big Bang Theory,211,35
7616,Leonard,14," Excuse me. When Frodo left the Shire to take the one ring to Mordor, didn't Samwise, Pippin and Merry go with him?",2,Big Bang Theory,115,22
7617,Sheldon,14, They did.,2,Big Bang Theory,10,2
7618,Leonard,14, Well?,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
7619,Sheldon,14," They had a terrible time of it, Leonard.",2,Big Bang Theory,41,8
7620,Raj,14," Plus, no one stole their pants.",2,Big Bang Theory,32,6
7621,Leonard,14, Fine. Just enjoy your little game. I'll make this quest on my own.,2,Big Bang Theory,67,13
7622,Howard,14," Leonard, wait. Take a jacket, it's spritzing a little.",2,Big Bang Theory,55,9
7623,Leonard,14," You guys suck.  Come on, please? He's so big.",2,Big Bang Theory,46,9
7625,Leonard,14," Okay, is everyone clear on the plan?",2,Big Bang Theory,37,7
7626,Howard,14," Yes. Koothrappali's going to wet himself, I'm gonna throw up, Sheldon's gonna run away, and you're going to die. Shall we synchronize our watches?",2,Big Bang Theory,147,24
7627,Leonard,14," Guys, there are four of us and one of him.",2,Big Bang Theory,43,10
7628,Sheldon,14, Which means his triumph will be even larger. Minstrels will write songs about him.,2,Big Bang Theory,83,14
7629,Leonard,14," Okay, how about this? I'll do the talking, you just stand behind me and try to look formidable.",2,Big Bang Theory,96,18
7630,Raj,14, I should've peed before we left.,2,Big Bang Theory,33,6
7632,Leonard,14," Hi, Kurt.",2,Big Bang Theory,10,2
7634,Leonard,14," I don't really go by Lenny, but that's okay. Um, you remember Sheldon, Howard and Raj.",2,Big Bang Theory,87,16
7636,Sheldon,14, You don't remember me? How could he not remember me?,2,Big Bang Theory,53,10
7637,Leonard,14," Sheldon, not now.",2,Big Bang Theory,18,3
7638,Sheldon,14, I remember him.,2,Big Bang Theory,16,3
7639,Leonard,14," Okay, here it is. Penny's in kind of a financial jam, and the money that you owe her would go a long way to solving her problems.",2,Big Bang Theory,130,27
7641,Leonard,14," No, no, she's too proud to ask for the money. I, on the other hand, feel you should honour your debt.",2,Big Bang Theory,102,21
7643,Leonard,14," Feel is a kind of a it's a strong word. Um, I just think it would be a nice gesture on your part.",2,Big Bang Theory,98,23
7645,Howard,14," Well, there you go. Problem solved.",2,Big Bang Theory,36,6
7646,Raj,14, A successful quest. Now let's go find a gas station with a clean bathroom.,2,Big Bang Theory,75,14
7647,Leonard,14," No, the problem isn't solved. He just blew us off.",2,Big Bang Theory,51,10
7648,Sheldon,14, I've got it. He didn't remember me because the last time we met I was in a Halloween costume.,2,Big Bang Theory,94,19
7649,Howard,14," Come on, Leonard, let's go",2,Big Bang Theory,27,5
7650,Leonard,14, No. You can leave if you want to. I'm gonna see this through.,2,Big Bang Theory,62,13
7651,Howard,14, Okay.  ,2,Big Bang Theory,8,1
7652,Leonard,14," I guess, technically, that was my fault.  I'm not leaving here without Penny's money.",2,Big Bang Theory,86,14
7654,Leonard,14, I don't need backup. I have right on my side. And I'm wearing cargo shorts under my pants.,2,Big Bang Theory,91,18
7656,Sheldon,14," Congratulations. You may not have succeeded in getting cash, but you did secure a formal acknowledgment of the debt.  ",2,Big Bang Theory,119,19
7657,Howard,14, Maybe we should have your head notarized.,2,Big Bang Theory,42,7
7658,Raj,14," If anybody cares, I still have to pee.",2,Big Bang Theory,39,8
7660,Leonard,14, Hey.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
7661,Penny,14," Hey, is Sheldon here?",2,Big Bang Theory,22,4
7662,Leonard,14, Yeah. Hang on. Sheldon!,2,Big Bang Theory,24,4
7663,Penny,14, Nice hat.,2,Big Bang Theory,10,2
7664,Leonard,14, It's kind of a fashionable look these days.,2,Big Bang Theory,44,8
7665,Penny,14, Maybe if you're working on a tuna boat.,2,Big Bang Theory,40,8
7666,Sheldon,14," Hello, Penny.",2,Big Bang Theory,14,2
7667,Penny,14," Sheldon, here is your money. Thank you very much. It helped a lot.",2,Big Bang Theory,67,13
7668,Sheldon,14, Sarcasm?,2,Big Bang Theory,9,1
7669,Penny,14, No.,2,Big Bang Theory,4,1
7670,Sheldon,14, Darn. I can't seem to get the hang of that.,2,Big Bang Theory,44,10
7671,Leonard,14," Hey, I know it's none of my business, but where did the money come from?",2,Big Bang Theory,73,15
7672,Penny,14," Well, I cut back my expenses like you said and picked up a few more hours at the restaurant, but the biggest thing was, out of the blue, Kurt shows up and gives me the money he owes me.",2,Big Bang Theory,186,39
7673,Leonard,14, Really? Did he say why?,2,Big Bang Theory,24,5
7674,Penny,14," Yes, he said he was feeling guilty and wanted to do what was right.",2,Big Bang Theory,68,14
7675,Leonard,14, That's it? Did he give any reason as to why he came to this moral epiphany?,2,Big Bang Theory,76,16
7676,Penny,14," Nope. I just think he's really changed. We're having dinner tomorrow night, and I get to wear my new beret. Bye, guys.",2,Big Bang Theory,119,22
7677,Leonard,14, Bye.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
7678,Sheldon,14," Well done, Leonard. The true hero doesn't seek adulation, he fights for right and justice simply because it's his nature.",2,Big Bang Theory,122,20
7679,Leonard,14, Penny's hooking up with her jerk of an ex-boyfriend and I have indelible ink on my forehead!,2,Big Bang Theory,93,17
7680,Sheldon,14," That's your badge of honour, your warrior's wound, if you will. I was wrong, minstrels will write songs about you.",2,Big Bang Theory,115,20
7681,Leonard,14, Great.,2,Big Bang Theory,7,1
7682,Sheldon,14," There once was a brave lad named Leonard, with a fi-fi-fiddle-dee-dee. He faced a fearsome giant, while Raj just wanted to pee.",2,Big Bang Theory,128,22
7684,Penny,15," Fellas, please.",2,Big Bang Theory,16,2
7685,Howard,15," Penny, come on, we were just finding our sound.",2,Big Bang Theory,48,9
7686,Penny,15, You found it. It's the sound of a cat being run over by a lawn mower.,2,Big Bang Theory,70,16
7687,Leonard,15," I'm really very busy. Is there any way that we can put this off until I have more time to prepare? Of course. But, uh, you understand my trepidation.",2,Big Bang Theory,150,29
7688,Penny,15, What's that about?,2,Big Bang Theory,19,3
7689,Howard,15, Not a clue.,2,Big Bang Theory,12,3
7690,Leonard,15, Can't we just postpone it till the spring? Maybe next summer?,2,Big Bang Theory,62,11
7691,Sheldon,15," This should be fairly easy to deduce. He's holding the phone to his left ear. Ears do not cross hemispheres, so he's using the analytical rather than the emotional side of the brain, suggesting that he has no personal relationship with the caller.",2,Big Bang Theory,248,43
7692,Leonard,15," No, I didn't realize it had been so long. Sure, I guess there's no other choice but to just go ahead and do it.",2,Big Bang Theory,112,24
7693,Sheldon,15," He's referring to an activity he has done before. It's unpleasant and needs to be repeated. This suggests some sort of invasive medical test, like perhaps a colonoscopy.",2,Big Bang Theory,170,28
7694,Leonard,15," Aren't there any other options? There's not a lot of room, it's gonna be uncomfortable.",2,Big Bang Theory,88,15
7695,Sheldon,15," Yes, yes. Yeah, I'm definitely going with colonoscopy.",2,Big Bang Theory,55,8
7696,Leonard,15," Okay, bye. My mother's coming to visit.",2,Big Bang Theory,40,7
7697,Howard,15," How about that, you were right.",2,Big Bang Theory,32,6
7699,Penny,15, It's out of order.,2,Big Bang Theory,19,4
7701,Penny,15, I think it implies that the elevator doesn't work.,2,Big Bang Theory,51,9
7703,Penny,15, You must be Leonard's mother.,2,Big Bang Theory,30,5
7705,Penny,15," Uh, I'm Penny. I'm his neighbour.",2,Big Bang Theory,34,6
7707,Penny,15," Oh, nice to meet you.",2,Big Bang Theory,22,5
7709,Penny,15," Uh, why don't you come with me. I'll walk you to the apartment.",2,Big Bang Theory,64,13
7711,Penny,15," Yeah, sure, I guess.",2,Big Bang Theory,21,4
7713,Penny,15," Okay. You know, I've always been curious. What was Leonard like when he was little?",2,Big Bang Theory,84,15
7715,Penny,15," Right, okay. What was he like when he was young?",2,Big Bang Theory,49,10
7717,Penny,15," Oh, um, okay, like, five or six. Five.",2,Big Bang Theory,39,8
7719,Penny,15," Yeah, Leonard mentioned you were a psychiatrist.",2,Big Bang Theory,49,7
7721,Penny,15," Oh, well, I'm an actress.",2,Big Bang Theory,26,5
7723,Penny,15, What do you mean why?,2,Big Bang Theory,22,5
7725,Penny,15," Yeah, I don't know what that means.",2,Big Bang Theory,36,7
7727,Penny,15," Oh, well, I had a wonderful childhood.",2,Big Bang Theory,39,7
7729,Penny,15," I know my dad wanted a boy. I just, I tried being good at sports, but I hated getting dirty!",2,Big Bang Theory,93,20
7731,Penny,15," Uh-huh, he called me Slugger until I got my first training bra, and then he just stopped playing catch with me. I wasn't Slugger anymore. Your mother's here!",2,Big Bang Theory,158,28
7733,Leonard,15," Good to see you, Mother.",2,Big Bang Theory,25,5
7735,Leonard,15," Here's your tea, Mother.",2,Big Bang Theory,25,4
7737,Leonard,15, Yes.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
7739,Leonard,15, Yes.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
7741,Leonard,15, Yes.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
7743,Leonard,15, Yes.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
7745,Leonard,15, Yes.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
7747,Leonard,15, Yes.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
7749,Leonard,15, Yes.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
7751,Leonard,15, I'll start again.,2,Big Bang Theory,18,3
7752,Sheldon,15, I have the same problem with him. My theory is that his lack of focus stems from an over-developed sex drive.,2,Big Bang Theory,110,21
7754,Sheldon,15, That seems a fairly efficient arrangement.,2,Big Bang Theory,43,6
7756,Sheldon,15, Of course. I would very much like to read about your sex life.,2,Big Bang Theory,63,13
7758,Leonard,15," Here's your tea, Mother. So, what are you guys talking about?",2,Big Bang Theory,62,11
7759,Sheldon,15, The frequency with which your parents had intercourse.,2,Big Bang Theory,55,8
7760,Leonard,15," Swell. If you're lucky, maybe she'll show you the PowerPoint presentation.",2,Big Bang Theory,75,11
7762,Sheldon,15, Aw,2,Big Bang Theory,3,1
7763,Leonard,15," So, Mother, what's new?",2,Big Bang Theory,24,4
7765,Leonard,15," All right. Uh, what's new with you?",2,Big Bang Theory,36,7
7767,Leonard,15, Maybe something less personal.,2,Big Bang Theory,31,4
7769,Leonard,15," Oh, my God. What happened?",2,Big Bang Theory,27,5
7771,Sheldon,15, What a remarkable woman.,2,Big Bang Theory,25,4
7772,Leonard,15," Yeah I, I thought you guys might hit it off.",2,Big Bang Theory,45,10
7773,Sheldon,15, I envy you your childhood.,2,Big Bang Theory,27,5
7774,Leonard,15," I hate to tell you, but the only warm memories I have of my childhood are of my Uncle Floyd.",2,Big Bang Theory,93,20
7775,Sheldon,15," You're clearly misremembering. Your mother is brilliant, analytical, insightful, and I'm betting she never hit you with a Bible because you wouldn't eat your Brussels sprouts.",2,Big Bang Theory,176,26
7776,Leonard,15," Sheldon, you don't give your mother enough credit. She's warm, she's loving, she doesn't glue electrodes to your head to measure your brain waves while potty training.",2,Big Bang Theory,168,27
7777,Sheldon,15," You were lucky. When I was a kid, if I wanted an EEG, I had to attach my own electrodes.",2,Big Bang Theory,89,20
7779,Howard,15," So, Dr. Hofstadter, Leonard rarely talks about his incredibly successful brother and sister.",2,Big Bang Theory,93,13
7780,Leonard,15," Please, don't go there, Howard.",2,Big Bang Theory,32,5
7781,Howard,15," I understand that unlike Leonard, they're at the top of their respective fields.",2,Big Bang Theory,81,13
7782,Leonard,15," Boy, you suck.",2,Big Bang Theory,15,3
7784,Howard,15," So, she's close to curing diabetes?",2,Big Bang Theory,36,6
7786,Howard,15," Wow, you must be very proud.",2,Big Bang Theory,29,6
7788,Leonard,15, Why are you doing this?,2,Big Bang Theory,24,5
7789,Howard,15," You know the rules. You brought your mom to work, you must suffer.",2,Big Bang Theory,67,13
7790,Sheldon,15," Leonard, I had no idea your siblings were so much more successful than you.",2,Big Bang Theory,76,14
7791,Raj,15," Yeah, you're like the Jar Jar Binks of the Hofstadter family.",2,Big Bang Theory,62,11
7792,Howard,15," Oh, meesa think yousa lookin' so so sad.",2,Big Bang Theory,41,8
7793,Leonard,15," You know, rather than mock me, my friends might realize that this is difficult and try to help me through it.",2,Big Bang Theory,110,21
7794,Raj,15," Nope, I think mocking you is more fun.",2,Big Bang Theory,39,8
7795,Howard,15," Next time, don't yousa bring mama to work. Okee-day?",2,Big Bang Theory,53,9
7796,Leonard,15, That was fast.,2,Big Bang Theory,15,3
7798,Sheldon,15," It's totally understandable. In bladder voiding, as in real estate, it's location, location, location.",2,Big Bang Theory,103,14
7800,Leonard,15, Howard lives with his mother and Raj can't speak to women unless he's drunk. Go.,2,Big Bang Theory,81,15
7802,Howard,15," It's just temporary, I pay rent.",2,Big Bang Theory,33,6
7803,Leonard,15, He lives in the same room where his bassinet was.,2,Big Bang Theory,50,10
7805,Howard,15, Say what?  That's basically what I just said.,2,Big Bang Theory,46,8
7806,Leonard,15," You brought your husband to work, you know the rules. Meesa thinking yousa looking pretty sad now too, betcha, betcha.",2,Big Bang Theory,119,20
7808,Leonard,15," There's no hurry, Mother, tell them more about their secret love for each other.",2,Big Bang Theory,81,14
7810,Sheldon,15, Her reasoning is unassailable. It is one o'clock.,2,Big Bang Theory,50,8
7811,Leonard,15, Fine. Let's go. I think you'll find my work pretty interesting. I'm attempting to replicate the dark matter signal found in sodium iodide crystals by the Italians.,2,Big Bang Theory,164,27
7813,Leonard,15, No.,2,Big Bang Theory,4,1
7815,Howard,15," Just for the record, we're not in an ersatz homosexual relationship.",2,Big Bang Theory,69,11
7816,Raj,15," Well, then why didn't you say that to her?",2,Big Bang Theory,43,9
7817,Howard,15, Why is it always my responsibility?,2,Big Bang Theory,36,6
7818,Raj,15," It's not always your responsibility. I swear, this is the same thing you did at the comic book store last week.",2,Big Bang Theory,112,21
7819,Howard,15, I can't believe you're bringing that up.,2,Big Bang Theory,41,7
7820,Raj,15, I didn't bring it up. You did.,2,Big Bang Theory,31,7
7821,Howard,15, We'll talk about this later.,2,Big Bang Theory,29,5
7822,Raj,15," You always say that, but we never do.",2,Big Bang Theory,38,8
7823,Sheldon,15, You went to the comic book store without me.7,2,Big Bang Theory,46,9
7825,Penny,15, Hey.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
7826,Leonard,15, You got alcohol?,2,Big Bang Theory,17,3
7827,Penny,15, Your mom still here?,2,Big Bang Theory,21,4
7828,Leonard,15, Yep.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
7829,Penny,15," Come on in. Wait, wait, she's not gonna come here looking for you, is she?",2,Big Bang Theory,75,15
7830,Leonard,15," Oh, relax. She took Sheldon to the hospital to get a brain scan.",2,Big Bang Theory,65,13
7831,Penny,15," Oh, my God. What happened?",2,Big Bang Theory,27,5
7832,Leonard,15, Nothing. Mother likes looking at brains and Sheldon likes getting his brain scanned.,2,Big Bang Theory,85,13
7833,Penny,15," Geez, what a fun couple.",2,Big Bang Theory,25,5
7834,Leonard,15, She's only been here a day and a half and I'm seriously considering alcoholism as a new career path.,2,Big Bang Theory,101,19
7835,Penny,15," Hey, I talked to her for five minutes yesterday and I've been half bombed ever since.",2,Big Bang Theory,86,16
7836,Leonard,15, You can't let her get into your head.,2,Big Bang Theory,38,8
7837,Penny,15," My head, what about yours?",2,Big Bang Theory,27,5
7838,Leonard,15, It's too late for me. My head is her summer house.,2,Big Bang Theory,51,11
7839,Penny,15," She was right, you know. The locus of my identity is totally exterior to me.",2,Big Bang Theory,77,15
7840,Leonard,15," Oh, yeah, there she is. Hi, Mom.",2,Big Bang Theory,33,7
7841,Penny,15," I mean, do you know where I was all morning? Auditioning with 50 other blondes for some stupid antidepressant commercial. And for what? So I'll finally get my daddy's approval?",2,Big Bang Theory,177,30
7842,Leonard,15, Did you get the part?,2,Big Bang Theory,22,5
7843,Penny,15," No, they said I was too perky.",2,Big Bang Theory,31,7
7844,Leonard,15," Hey, you want to talk about not getting love from a parent. You know what I used to do when I was little to have some sensation of human contact?",2,Big Bang Theory,146,30
7845,Penny,15," Yeah, you grabbed your penis and wouldn't let go. Your mother told me.",2,Big Bang Theory,71,13
7846,Leonard,15," Of course she did. Anyway, that's not what I was gonna say. When I was ten years old, I built a hugging machine.",2,Big Bang Theory,113,23
7847,Penny,15, A hugging machine?,2,Big Bang Theory,19,3
7848,Leonard,15," Yeah. I got a dressmaker's mannequin, I stuffed it with an electric blanket so it would be warm, and built two radio-controlled arms that would hug me and pat my back.",2,Big Bang Theory,168,31
7849,Penny,15," Oh, that is so sad.",2,Big Bang Theory,20,5
7850,Leonard,15, You know what the saddest part was?,2,Big Bang Theory,36,7
7851,Penny,15, What?,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
7852,Leonard,15, My father used to borrow it.,2,Big Bang Theory,29,6
7855,Sheldon,15, I know. Although I've always hated how my right frontal lobe looks in pictures.,2,Big Bang Theory,80,14
7857,Sheldon,15, I'd love to see a scan of your brain sometime.,2,Big Bang Theory,47,10
7859,Sheldon,15," Oh, I can't believe that.",2,Big Bang Theory,26,5
7861,Sheldon,15, My apologies. I've been living with your son too long. Gotten into some bad habits.,2,Big Bang Theory,84,15
7863,Sheldon,15, Can I make you a cup of tea?,2,Big Bang Theory,29,8
7865,Sheldon,15, I feel very comfortable around you.,2,Big Bang Theory,36,6
7867,Sheldon,15," It's surprising because I generally don't feel comfortable around, well, anyone.",2,Big Bang Theory,81,11
7869,Sheldon,15, What are the odds that two individuals as unique as ourselves would be connected by someone as comparatively workaday as your son?,2,Big Bang Theory,131,22
7871,Sheldon,15, I'd like to do the math.,2,Big Bang Theory,25,6
7874,Penny,15," Okay, now this time",2,Big Bang Theory,20,4
7875,Leonard,15, Uh-huh.,2,Big Bang Theory,8,1
7876,Penny,15," You're gonna lick the salt off my neck, do the shot, and then bite the lime.",2,Big Bang Theory,77,16
7877,Leonard,15," I'm sorry, I didn't hear anything after lick.",2,Big Bang Theory,46,8
7878,Penny,15," Neck, shot, lime.  Okay, shot, lime.",2,Big Bang Theory,37,6
7879,Leonard,15," Right. Ah! Where's the lime?  Oh, okay, we're sharing.",2,Big Bang Theory,55,9
7881,Sheldon,15," So, what do you think?",2,Big Bang Theory,23,5
7883,Sheldon,15," Normally, I'd feel the same way. But based on everything I've observed about us, I can't help but speculate we'd be very good together.",2,Big Bang Theory,136,24
7885,Sheldon,15," I was hesitant the first time I tried it, but I experienced an unanticipated and remarkable release of endorphins. It's quite satisfying.",2,Big Bang Theory,138,22
7887,Sheldon,15," You see right through me, don't you?",2,Big Bang Theory,37,7
7890,Leonard,15, This is actually gonna happen.,2,Big Bang Theory,31,5
7891,Penny,15," Honey, shush, shush, shush, shush, shush.",2,Big Bang Theory,42,6
7892,Leonard,15," You shush, I'm happy, I want to talk about it. You know what my mother would say about this? She would say because you were not loved by your father and I was not loved by my mother, that having sex is our way of making up for the intimacy we didn't get as children.",2,Big Bang Theory,267,55
7893,Penny,15, Why would you bring that up right now?,2,Big Bang Theory,39,8
7894,Leonard,15, I don't know. Foreplay?,2,Big Bang Theory,24,4
7895,Penny,15," So you're saying you're not having sex with me, you're having sex with your mother?",2,Big Bang Theory,84,15
7896,Leonard,15," Ummm, I'm gonna go with â€œno.â€ù",2,Big Bang Theory,34,6
7897,Penny,15, That is the sickest thing I've ever heard.,2,Big Bang Theory,43,8
7898,Leonard,15," Come on, you're trying to have sex with your father, and I'm okay with that.",2,Big Bang Theory,77,15
7900,Penny,15, Get out!,2,Big Bang Theory,9,2
7901,Leonard,15, She said shush. I should have shushed. ,2,Big Bang Theory,40,7
7903,Leonard,15," All right, Mother. Um, have a nice flight.",2,Big Bang Theory,43,8
7905,Penny,15," Oh, good morning.",2,Big Bang Theory,18,3
7906,Leonard,15, Morning.,2,Big Bang Theory,9,1
7907,Penny,15," Look, I was just coming over to talk to you.",2,Big Bang Theory,45,10
7908,Leonard,15, You don't have to. Ever.,2,Big Bang Theory,25,5
7909,Penny,15, Gotcha.,2,Big Bang Theory,8,1
7910,Leonard,15," Good-bye, Mother.",2,Big Bang Theory,18,2
7912,Penny,15," I mean, my mom could've just said, â€œBob, get over it, she's a girl, move on.â€ù But she didn't. Not one word.",2,Big Bang Theory,112,22
7914,Penny,15, Would it help?,2,Big Bang Theory,15,3
7917,Howard,16, That was close.,2,Big Bang Theory,16,3
7918,Raj,16," God, I love the smell of paintballs in the morning.",2,Big Bang Theory,52,10
7919,Howard,16," Yeah, still funny, Raj.",2,Big Bang Theory,24,4
7920,Leonard,16, There's no way we can get to the ridge. The Chemistry Department has us completely cut off.,2,Big Bang Theory,92,17
7921,Howard,16, But what about the creek bed?,2,Big Bang Theory,30,6
7922,Sheldon,16," The Pharmacology Department controls that, and they're all hopped up on experimental steroids.",2,Big Bang Theory,95,13
7923,Raj,16," Well, that's it then, we're doomed.",2,Big Bang Theory,36,6
7924,Sheldon,16, I think the time has come to acknowledge that we are paying the price for some of us failing to attend my Physics Department paintball strategy meeting.,2,Big Bang Theory,153,27
7925,Howard,16," I told you my mom has spider veins, I had to take her to the laser clinic.",2,Big Bang Theory,75,17
7926,Sheldon,16, And I told you I wanted to see a doctor's note.,2,Big Bang Theory,48,11
7927,Raj,16, We need a plan. How about Operation Hammer of the Gods?,2,Big Bang Theory,56,11
7928,Leonard,16, I forget. Which one is Hammer of the Gods?,2,Big Bang Theory,43,9
7929,Raj,16, We hide behind the Dumpsters in the parking lot and ambush people when they come to pee.,2,Big Bang Theory,89,17
7930,Howard,16, No go. The Dumpsters are deep in Astronomy Department territory.,2,Big Bang Theory,65,10
7931,Leonard,16," No, that shouldn't be a problem, Venus is up during the day. They're probably just all staring at the sky.",2,Big Bang Theory,107,20
7932,Sheldon,16," All right, what we need now is a tactical retreat. Did you see the episode of Stargate where they found themselves on a planet with a culture based loosely on Earth's Athens and Sparta? Not important. Leonard, Raj and I are going to burst out the door and run away, Howard will cover us.",2,Big Bang Theory,288,54
7933,Howard,16, Why don't I run away and you cover me?,2,Big Bang Theory,39,9
7934,Sheldon,16," Because you chose your mother's veins over victory. On three. One, two, three, go!",2,Big Bang Theory,83,14
7935,Howard,16, I had to take her! It's almost bathing suit weather!,2,Big Bang Theory,53,10
7937,Howard,16," Oh, Leslie, thank God.",2,Big Bang Theory,23,4
7939,Howard,16," Ah, they left me here to die. What about yours?",2,Big Bang Theory,48,10
7941,Howard,16, Sorry.,2,Big Bang Theory,7,1
7943,Howard,16," Well, we're surrounded, so I guess there's nothing for us to do but wait to be captured or killed.",2,Big Bang Theory,99,19
7945,Howard,16, All the while knowing that there's a paint pellet out there with your name on it.,2,Big Bang Theory,82,16
7947,Howard,16, It kind of does.,2,Big Bang Theory,17,4
7949,Howard,16, I agree. How exactly do we do that? ,2,Big Bang Theory,37,8
7950,Leonard,16," Howard, why aren't you covering us? We're getting slaughtered out here!",2,Big Bang Theory,72,11
7951,Howard,16, War is hell.,2,Big Bang Theory,13,3
7953,Raj,16, Did you guys see the new budget memo that went out this morning?,2,Big Bang Theory,65,13
7954,Leonard,16," Yeah, more cutbacks.",2,Big Bang Theory,21,3
7955,Sheldon,16, Unacceptable. It baffles me why they don't simply let some of you go so that there's money available for my research.,2,Big Bang Theory,118,21
7956,Leonard,16," You know what baffles me, Sheldon?",2,Big Bang Theory,35,6
7957,Sheldon,16," Based on your academic record, any number of things, I would imagine.",2,Big Bang Theory,70,12
7959,Leonard,16," Hey, Leslie.",2,Big Bang Theory,13,2
7960,Howard,16, Hey.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
7962,Howard,16," That's great, Leslie. Thanks.",2,Big Bang Theory,30,4
7964,Raj,16, What was all that about?,2,Big Bang Theory,25,5
7965,Howard,16," Oh, uh, no big deal. They gave Leslie control of some unrestricted grant money.",2,Big Bang Theory,80,14
7966,Leonard,16," Yeah, okay, but what's with the back-scratching and the meow!",2,Big Bang Theory,62,10
7967,Sheldon,16, I believe the back-scratching metaphor generally describes a quid pro quo situation where one party provides goods or services to the second party in compensation for a similar action.,2,Big Bang Theory,185,29
7968,Leonard,16, Thank you.,2,Big Bang Theory,11,2
7969,Sheldon,16," The mrow, that sounded to me like an African civet cat.",2,Big Bang Theory,56,11
7970,Leonard,16, Are you done?,2,Big Bang Theory,14,3
7971,Sheldon,16," No. Despite what the name suggests, the civet cat is not a true cat. Now I'm done.",2,Big Bang Theory,83,17
7972,Raj,16, You know what I'm thinking? I'm thinking Howard wasn't making a back-scratching metaphor. I'm thinking there was some actual scratching involved.,2,Big Bang Theory,146,21
7973,Leonard,16," What about it, Howard?",2,Big Bang Theory,23,4
7974,Howard,16," Okay, I didn't want to say anything 'cause I know you and Leslie have a little history.",2,Big Bang Theory,88,17
7975,Leonard,16, I don't care about that.,2,Big Bang Theory,25,5
7976,Howard,16," Great, 'cause I've been dying to say something.",2,Big Bang Theory,48,8
7977,Leonard,16, You and Leslie?,2,Big Bang Theory,16,3
7978,Howard,16, In the paintball shed! Twice!,2,Big Bang Theory,30,5
7979,Sheldon,16, Is that why you didn't cover our escape and let us get cut down like animals?,2,Big Bang Theory,78,16
7980,Howard,16," Oh, yeah, sorry about that.",2,Big Bang Theory,28,5
7981,Sheldon,16," My good man, dereliction of duty in the face of the enemy is a court-martial offense.",2,Big Bang Theory,86,16
7982,Howard,16," Court-martial, schmort-martial, Leslie Winkle is the fifth girl I've ever had sex with. I mean, for free.",2,Big Bang Theory,106,17
7983,Raj,16," And plus, you got a rapid prototyper. That's an expensive piece of equipment, dude.",2,Big Bang Theory,84,14
7984,Leonard,16, And the rest of us have had our budgets cut to the bone.,2,Big Bang Theory,57,13
7985,Howard,16," Okay, one way to look at this is that I'm getting new equipment, and you're not, and that's unfair. But a better way to look at this is that I'm getting sex and you're not, and that's delightful.",2,Big Bang Theory,196,38
7987,Penny,16, The whole thing froze. I don't know what happened.,2,Big Bang Theory,51,9
7988,Leonard,16, Calm down. We'll figure it out.,2,Big Bang Theory,32,6
7989,Penny,16, How can I calm down? I'm gonna lose my whole shopping cart. That's three hours of picking out shoes just shot to hell.,2,Big Bang Theory,119,23
7990,Sheldon,16," Hello, Penny.",2,Big Bang Theory,14,2
7991,Penny,16," Hello, Sheldon.",2,Big Bang Theory,16,2
7992,Sheldon,16, You're in my spot.,2,Big Bang Theory,19,4
7993,Penny,16, Are you planning on sitting here?,2,Big Bang Theory,34,6
7994,Sheldon,16," No, I'm going to the comic book store.",2,Big Bang Theory,39,8
7995,Penny,16, Then what difference does it make?,2,Big Bang Theory,35,6
7996,Sheldon,16, What difference does it make?,2,Big Bang Theory,30,5
7997,Leonard,16, Here we go.,2,Big Bang Theory,12,3
7998,Sheldon,16," That is my spot. In an ever-changing world, it is a single point of consistency. If my life were expressed as a function on a four-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, that spot at the moment I first sat on it would be zero-zero-zero-zero.",2,Big Bang Theory,244,42
7999,Penny,16, What?,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
8000,Leonard,16, Don't sit in his spot.,2,Big Bang Theory,23,5
8001,Penny,16, Fine.   Happy?,2,Big Bang Theory,15,2
8002,Sheldon,16, I'm not unhappy.,2,Big Bang Theory,17,3
8003,Penny,16," Boy, I love him, but he is one serious wackadoodle.",2,Big Bang Theory,52,10
8004,Leonard,16," Okay, that should do it.",2,Big Bang Theory,25,5
8005,Penny,16," Oh, thank you. You are a lifesaver.",2,Big Bang Theory,36,7
8006,Leonard,16, That's a lot of shoes you ordered.,2,Big Bang Theory,35,7
8007,Penny,16," Yeah, you know the sad thing is, it's really not. Ooh, is this one of those paintball guns?",2,Big Bang Theory,92,18
8008,Leonard,16, Yeah. You ought to come out with us sometime.,2,Big Bang Theory,46,9
8009,Penny,16," Oh, no, thanks. I'm from Nebraska. When we shoot things, it's because we want to eat them or make them leave our boyfriends alone. ",2,Big Bang Theory,132,24
8012,Howard,16," Well, it's partly you, partly my transient idiopathic arrhythmia.",2,Big Bang Theory,66,9
8014,Howard,16, Can I assume that you likewise found the experience,2,Big Bang Theory,52,9
8016,Howard,16," That wasn't quite the word I was looking for, but sure, I'll do this pass-fail.",2,Big Bang Theory,80,15
8018,Howard,16," Oh, it's great. Everybody in the Engineering Department is eating their hearts out.",2,Big Bang Theory,84,13
8020,Howard,16," You know, most people don't get that.",2,Big Bang Theory,38,7
8022,Howard,16," Oh, great.",2,Big Bang Theory,11,2
8024,Howard,16," I'm busy, Ma!",2,Big Bang Theory,14,3
8026,Howard,16," Don't come in, Ma!",2,Big Bang Theory,19,4
8029,Howard,16," Oh, there's the arrhythmia.",2,Big Bang Theory,28,4
8031,Howard,16, Are you Jewish?,2,Big Bang Theory,16,3
8033,Howard,16, Yes!,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
8036,Penny,16, You think he'll notice?,2,Big Bang Theory,24,4
8037,Leonard,16, There's a chance.,2,Big Bang Theory,18,3
8038,Penny,16," Oh, what are we gonna do?",2,Big Bang Theory,26,6
8039,Leonard,16," We? No, no, no, you had your chance to be we for, like, a year and a half now. Right now, you are you, and you are screwed.",2,Big Bang Theory,124,28
8040,Penny,16, Why do we have to tell him I did it?,2,Big Bang Theory,37,10
8041,Leonard,16," Well, we're not gonna tell him I did it.",2,Big Bang Theory,41,9
8042,Penny,16," Okay, okay, how about this? We tell him somebody broke in.",2,Big Bang Theory,59,11
8043,Leonard,16, Just to shoot the couch with a paintball gun?,2,Big Bang Theory,46,9
8044,Penny,16," I'm sorry, I buy it. All those people are on drugs.",2,Big Bang Theory,52,11
8045,Leonard,16, We could tell him they wanted the couch to stay away from their boyfriend.,2,Big Bang Theory,75,14
8046,Penny,16," Okay, fine. Well, what if we just flip it over? There. Looks fine, right?",2,Big Bang Theory,74,14
8047,Leonard,16," Mm, butt print. There's no discernible butt print.",2,Big Bang Theory,51,8
8048,Penny,16," Oh, come on.  There, butt print.",2,Big Bang Theory,33,6
8049,Leonard,16, It's too small and too perfect.,2,Big Bang Theory,32,6
8050,Penny,16, Thank you.,2,Big Bang Theory,11,2
8051,Leonard,16, You're welcome.,2,Big Bang Theory,16,2
8052,Penny,16, Shh! Act normal.,2,Big Bang Theory,17,3
8053,Leonard,16, Sheldon! How was the comic book store?,2,Big Bang Theory,39,7
8054,Sheldon,16, Fine. The new issue of Flash is out.,2,Big Bang Theory,37,8
8055,Leonard,16," Great, great. Did you walk the whole way? It's a little chilly.",2,Big Bang Theory,64,12
8056,Sheldon,16, Koothrappali picked me up.,2,Big Bang Theory,27,4
8057,Leonard,16, Isn't that terrific? He is such a good friend. You know what the best thing about friends is?,2,Big Bang Theory,94,18
8058,Sheldon,16, They don't talk incessantly for no particular reason.,2,Big Bang Theory,54,8
8059,Leonard,16," No, no, friends forgive the little things.",2,Big Bang Theory,43,7
8060,Penny,16," You know, I gotta go home and wash my hair.",2,Big Bang Theory,44,10
8061,Leonard,16," Don't you dare, missy.",2,Big Bang Theory,23,4
8062,Sheldon,16," Hello, fastest man alive. Want to see me read your entire comic book? Want to see it again? Something's wrong.",2,Big Bang Theory,111,20
8063,Leonard,16, What do you mean?,2,Big Bang Theory,18,4
8064,Sheldon,16, I'm not sure. It doesn't feel right.,2,Big Bang Theory,37,7
8065,Leonard,16," I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, that. Penny did that.",2,Big Bang Theory,66,12
8067,Leonard,16, Why don't you just eat in your desk chair?,2,Big Bang Theory,43,9
8068,Sheldon,16, Why don't I just eat in my desk chair?,2,Big Bang Theory,39,9
8069,Penny,16, Here we go.,2,Big Bang Theory,12,3
8070,Sheldon,16," That is my desk chair, that is where I work. I don't eat in my desk chair and I don't work in my spot. I work in my desk chair and eat in my spot.",2,Big Bang Theory,147,35
8071,Leonard,16, Wackadoodle.,2,Big Bang Theory,13,1
8072,Howard,16," You know, there's kind of an obvious solution here.  Get up.  There. Problem solved.  Nobody cares where you're going to sit. You're not crazy.",2,Big Bang Theory,144,24
8073,Sheldon,16," Excuse me, but the problem is not solved. If your head had been accidentally amputated, and we transplanted a dog's head in its place, would that be â€œproblem solvedâ€ù?",2,Big Bang Theory,171,29
8074,Leonard,16," If it were your head, it would be.",2,Big Bang Theory,35,8
8075,Penny,16," Sheldon, I am really, really sorry, but it's only for a week. Can't you be a little bit flexible? Yeah, sorry. I didn't really think that through.",2,Big Bang Theory,147,27
8076,Sheldon,16," You claim it's going to be a week, but I have no faith in your dry cleaner.",2,Big Bang Theory,76,17
8077,Penny,16, Why not?,2,Big Bang Theory,9,2
8078,Sheldon,16, Did you notice the sign on his counter? He's not a full-time dry cleaner. He also makes keys.,2,Big Bang Theory,94,18
8079,Leonard,16," Oh, for God's sake, Sheldon.",2,Big Bang Theory,29,5
8080,Sheldon,16," Focus is important. Was Michael DeBakey a wedding planner in between heart transplants? Did Alexander Fleming moonlight as a hairdresser? â€œThanks for discovering penicillin, now how about we try a bouffant?â€ù",2,Big Bang Theory,212,31
8081,Howard,16," Ooh, looks like I'm gonna have sex tonight. Hey, baby",2,Big Bang Theory,54,10
8082,Penny,16, His right hand is calling him?,2,Big Bang Theory,31,6
8083,Leonard,16," No, it's Leslie Winkle. It's a long story.",2,Big Bang Theory,43,8
8084,Howard,16," I'll pick you up in ten minutes. Gentlemen, adieu.",2,Big Bang Theory,51,9
8085,Leonard,16, I thought we were going to play Halo tonight.,2,Big Bang Theory,46,9
8086,Howard,16," What am I supposed to do, Leonard? There's a woman out there anxious to have sex with me. You understand, right?",2,Big Bang Theory,113,21
8087,Penny,16, No. Not at all.,2,Big Bang Theory,16,4
8088,Howard,16," Nevertheless, I must depart. By the way, did I tell you? Leslie pulled some strings and got me on the research trip to Geneva to check out the CERN Supercollider.",2,Big Bang Theory,163,30
8089,Leonard,16, That's not fair. You're not even a physicist.,2,Big Bang Theory,46,8
8090,Howard,16," Okay, there are two ways of looking at this",2,Big Bang Theory,44,9
8091,Leonard,16, Get out.,2,Big Bang Theory,9,2
8092,Howard,16, Bye.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
8095,Howard,16, Thank you. It helps when I get to practice with a real woman.,2,Big Bang Theory,62,13
8097,Howard,16," Yeah, gee, I'd really rather not.",2,Big Bang Theory,34,6
8099,Howard,16," When I go to weddings, it's to scam on chunky bridesmaids. I don't know what I would do with a date.",2,Big Bang Theory,101,21
8101,Howard,16, Thanks.,2,Big Bang Theory,8,1
8103,Howard,16, What about it?,2,Big Bang Theory,15,3
8105,Howard,16, When did that happen?,2,Big Bang Theory,22,4
8107,Howard,16," Well, hold on. Are you saying if I don't go to the wedding, I can't go to Geneva?",2,Big Bang Theory,82,18
8109,Howard,16," Okay, I'm sorry, but that makes me a little uncomfortable.",2,Big Bang Theory,59,10
8111,Howard,16, Because it's like you're controlling me with new equipment and research trips.,2,Big Bang Theory,79,12
8113,Howard,16, How so?,2,Big Bang Theory,8,2
8115,Howard,16," So, bottom line, I'm just a bought-and-paid-for sex toy.",2,Big Bang Theory,57,9
8117,Howard,16," Hey, Ma, you got to rent me a tux!",2,Big Bang Theory,35,9
8120,Leonard,16, Why are you crouching there?,2,Big Bang Theory,29,5
8121,Sheldon,16, This is my spot. Where else am I supposed to crouch?,2,Big Bang Theory,53,11
8122,Leonard,16, I don't know. Texas?,2,Big Bang Theory,21,4
8123,Penny,16," Here you go. Fresh from the cleaners, good as new.",2,Big Bang Theory,51,10
8124,Leonard,16," Really? Great. Sheldon, look. Good as new.",2,Big Bang Theory,43,7
8125,Sheldon,16," From that key maker, I highly doubt it.",2,Big Bang Theory,40,8
8126,Penny,16," Come on, Sheldon. Just give it a try.",2,Big Bang Theory,38,8
8127,Sheldon,16, All right.,2,Big Bang Theory,11,2
8128,Penny,16," There, nice and comfy cosy. Zero, zero, zero.",2,Big Bang Theory,46,8
8129,Sheldon,16, There's one more zero. You forgot the time parameter.,2,Big Bang Theory,54,9
8130,Penny,16, Sit on the damn couch.,2,Big Bang Theory,23,5
8131,Sheldon,16, Nope.,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
8132,Penny,16," What do you mean, nope? What's wrong with it?",2,Big Bang Theory,46,9
8133,Leonard,16," Nothing, it's what's wrong with him.",2,Big Bang Theory,37,6
8134,Penny,16, It's exactly the same,2,Big Bang Theory,22,4
8135,Leonard,16," Penny, Penny, I think I know what to do. Sheldon, I have some bad news.",2,Big Bang Theory,72,15
8136,Sheldon,16, More?,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
8137,Leonard,16, I'm afraid so. You know the cashew chicken I get you Monday nights?,2,Big Bang Theory,68,13
8138,Sheldon,16, Yes. From Szechuan Palace.,2,Big Bang Theory,27,4
8139,Leonard,16, Szechuan Palace closed two years ago.,2,Big Bang Theory,38,6
8140,Sheldon,16, What? Wh-Where did my cashew chicken come from?,2,Big Bang Theory,48,8
8141,Leonard,16, Golden Dragon.,2,Big Bang Theory,15,2
8142,Sheldon,16," No. No, this isn't right. Our food always comes in Szechuan Palace containers.",2,Big Bang Theory,79,13
8143,Leonard,16," Yeah, well, before they went out of business, I bought 4,000 containers. I keep them in the trunk of my car.",2,Big Bang Theory,109,21
8144,Sheldon,16," But. Oh, this changes everything.",2,Big Bang Theory,34,5
8145,Leonard,16, I thought that might take his mind off the cushion.,2,Big Bang Theory,52,10
8146,Sheldon,16, What's real? What isn't? How can I know?,2,Big Bang Theory,41,8
8147,Penny,16," You did make that up, right?",2,Big Bang Theory,29,6
8148,Leonard,16," Oh, God, I wish I had.",2,Big Bang Theory,23,6
8149,Sheldon,16, Leonard?,2,Big Bang Theory,9,1
8150,Leonard,16," Yeah, buddy?",2,Big Bang Theory,13,2
8151,Sheldon,16, I still don't like this cushion.,2,Big Bang Theory,33,6
8153,Leonard,16," Okay, first of all, Penny, thank you for coming.",2,Big Bang Theory,49,9
8154,Penny,16, Thanks for the shoes.,2,Big Bang Theory,22,4
8155,Leonard,16, Penny is an amazing shot. I think we have a real chance to win this week.,2,Big Bang Theory,74,16
8156,Howard,16, What's the plan?,2,Big Bang Theory,17,3
8157,Leonard,16," Okay. Now, we all run out. Sheldon and I will cut to the left behind these trees. Raj, Howard and Leslie flank to the right behind the rocks. Then we'll all have a great view as Penny runs out and kills everyone else in sight.",2,Big Bang Theory,227,45
8158,Sheldon,16," Right, just one thing before we start.",2,Big Bang Theory,39,7
8159,Leonard,16," What is it, Sheldon? ",2,Big Bang Theory,22,4
8160,Penny,16, What the hell?,2,Big Bang Theory,15,3
8161,Sheldon,16, That was for my cushion.,2,Big Bang Theory,25,5
8162,Leonard,16," Sheldon, Penny was our only hope.",2,Big Bang Theory,34,6
8163,Sheldon,16," I'm sorry, Leonard. But revenge is a dish best served cold.",2,Big Bang Theory,60,11
8164,Penny,16, Screw that. ,2,Big Bang Theory,13,2
8165,Sheldon,16, She can't shoot me. She's dead.,2,Big Bang Theory,32,6
8166,Leonard,16, He's right. You can't. ,2,Big Bang Theory,24,4
8167,Sheldon,16," Well, if we're going to descend into anarchy ",2,Big Bang Theory,46,8
8168,Howard,16," Okay, see you.",2,Big Bang Theory,15,3
8169,Leonard,16, Where are you going?,2,Big Bang Theory,21,4
8172,Howard,17," Okay, Raj, hand me the number six torque screwdriver.",2,Big Bang Theory,54,9
8173,Sheldon,17," Stop. We can't do this, it's not right.",2,Big Bang Theory,40,8
8174,Raj,17," Sheldon, you have two choices. Either you let him put a bigger hard drive in the TiVo, or you delete stuff before we go out of town.",2,Big Bang Theory,133,27
8175,Sheldon,17," But once you open the box, you've voided the warranty. The warranty is a sacred covenant we've entered into with the manufacturer. He offers to stand by his equipment, and we in return agree not to violate the integrity of the internal hardware. This little orange sticker is all that stands between us and anarchy.",2,Big Bang Theory,316,55
8176,Leonard,17," Okay, then we won't touch the hard drive. We'll just erase the first season of Battlestar.",2,Big Bang Theory,91,16
8177,Sheldon,17, There. We're outlaws.,2,Big Bang Theory,22,3
8178,Penny,17," Here you go, Leonard. Is this going to be big enough?",2,Big Bang Theory,54,11
8179,Leonard,17, It's perfect.,2,Big Bang Theory,14,2
8180,Howard,17, For taking daffodils to your unicorn.,2,Big Bang Theory,38,6
8181,Leonard,17," It's just for my notebooks. Thanks, Penny.",2,Big Bang Theory,43,7
8182,Penny,17," Oh, I love San Francisco. I wish I was going with you.",2,Big Bang Theory,55,12
8183,Sheldon,17," I understand your envy. This is a can't-miss symposium. There are going to be discussions on bioorganic cellular computer devices, the advancements in multi-threaded task completion, plus a roundtable on the nonequilibrium Green's function approach to the photoionization process in atoms.",2,Big Bang Theory,290,41
8184,Penny,17," When I go, I usually just get hammered and ride the cable cars.",2,Big Bang Theory,64,13
8185,Leonard,17, This conference is kind of a big thing. The keynote address is being delivered by George Smoot.,2,Big Bang Theory,96,17
8186,Penny,17," Oh, my God, the George Smoot?",2,Big Bang Theory,30,6
8187,Leonard,17, You've heard of him?,2,Big Bang Theory,21,4
8188,Penny,17, Of course I haven't.,2,Big Bang Theory,21,4
8189,Sheldon,17," George Smoot is a Nobel Prize-winning physicist, one of the great minds of our time. His work in black body form and anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation cemented our understanding of the origin of the universe.",2,Big Bang Theory,231,38
8190,Penny,17," It's kind of a funny name, though, Smoot.",2,Big Bang Theory,42,8
8191,Sheldon,17, It's like talking to a chimp.,2,Big Bang Theory,30,6
8192,Penny,17," Okay, now that I've been completely insulted, have a good flight.",2,Big Bang Theory,66,11
8193,Leonard,17," Yeah, I wish.",2,Big Bang Theory,14,3
8194,Sheldon,17," We're not flying, we're taking the train.",2,Big Bang Theory,42,7
8195,Penny,17," Oh, cool.",2,Big Bang Theory,10,2
8196,Howard,17," Yeah, cool. Seven times as long as flying, and costs almost twice as much.",2,Big Bang Theory,75,14
8197,Penny,17," Well, then why are you doing it?",2,Big Bang Theory,33,7
8198,Leonard,17," Well, we had a vote. Three of us voted for airplane, Sheldon voted for train, so we're taking the train.",2,Big Bang Theory,105,20
8200,Leonard,17," Hey, we're all going over to the Apple store to make fun of the guys at the Genius Bar. You want to come?",2,Big Bang Theory,106,23
8201,Sheldon,17," Oh, I always enjoy that, but I'm a little busy.",2,Big Bang Theory,48,10
8202,Leonard,17, What are you doing?,2,Big Bang Theory,20,4
8203,Sheldon,17," I'm simplifying the task of packing for our trip. See, by attaching RFID tags to my clothing, it will enable my laptop to read and identify the items with this wand. I will then cross-reference them against destination, anticipated activity spectrum, weather conditions, duration of trip, et cetera.",2,Big Bang Theory,300,48
8204,Leonard,17," Well, that does sound much simpler. How long is this going to take?",2,Big Bang Theory,68,13
8205,Sheldon,17," Assuming I can keep up this pace, three hours, 11 minutes, and plus however long it takes to conclude this fairly pointless conversation.",2,Big Bang Theory,138,23
8206,Leonard,17, Wow. Teasing the guys at the Apple store seems a little redundant now.,2,Big Bang Theory,71,13
8207,Sheldon,17, I don't follow.,2,Big Bang Theory,16,3
8208,Leonard,17, I wouldn't expect you to. I'll see you later.,2,Big Bang Theory,46,9
8209,Sheldon,17," Socks, one pair, cotton, argyle, blue. Socks, one pair, cotton, argyle, blue.",2,Big Bang Theory,78,12
8211,Sheldon,17, What on earth are you doing?,2,Big Bang Theory,29,6
8212,Raj,17," Whatever it is, I'm guessing we're doing it wrong.",2,Big Bang Theory,51,9
8213,Sheldon,17," Gentlemen, this is the Coast Starlight, one of the great American trains operating on one of the classic American routes. On this side, you'll see panoramic ocean vistas inaccessible to any other form of transportation, while on your side, you'll be treated to 350 miles of CostCos, Jiffy Lubes, and cinderblock homes with above-ground pools.",2,Big Bang Theory,343,55
8214,Howard,17," Come on, Raj.",2,Big Bang Theory,14,3
8215,Raj,17, What's wrong with Jiffy Lubes?,2,Big Bang Theory,31,5
8216,Sheldon,17, No.,2,Big Bang Theory,4,1
8217,Leonard,17, Why not?,2,Big Bang Theory,9,2
8218,Sheldon,17, That's over the wheelbase. Are you completely unfamiliar with the suspension characteristics of a pre-1980 Pullman-built Superliner Deluxe passenger coach?,2,Big Bang Theory,156,20
8219,Leonard,17," Sheldon, we've been on this train 90 seconds, and you've already said a thousand words. Just tell us where to sit and shut up.",2,Big Bang Theory,127,24
8220,Sheldon,17," Here. I'm hoping once you reap the endorphic rewards of the steady clickety-clack of steel wheels on polished rails, your sour disposition will abate.",2,Big Bang Theory,151,24
8221,Leonard,17," Yeah, maybe. Meanwhile back in the 21st century, people are raising their tray tables and putting their seat-backs in an upright position 'cause it's time to land in San Francisco.",2,Big Bang Theory,181,30
8222,Raj,17," It's not so bad, really. At least these trains have modern plumbing. In India, you squat over a hole in the train and expose your naked buttocks to the chilly air of Rajasthan.",2,Big Bang Theory,177,33
8223,Sheldon,17," He is referring, of course, to third class on Indian Railways' magnificent Ranakpur Express and its twelve hundred kilometer journey from Maharashtra to the Bikaner Junction.",2,Big Bang Theory,175,26
8224,Leonard,17," Oh, look, now he's boring on an international scale.",2,Big Bang Theory,53,9
8225,Raj,17, Holy crap! Look!,2,Big Bang Theory,17,3
8226,Leonard,17, Is that who I think it is?,2,Big Bang Theory,27,7
8227,Howard,17, It can't be. What would Summer Glau be doing riding the train?,2,Big Bang Theory,63,12
8228,Leonard,17, Maybe John Connor's aboard and she's protecting him from an evil Terminator.,2,Big Bang Theory,77,12
8229,Sheldon,17," Unlikely. That's a television show, Leonard.",2,Big Bang Theory,45,6
8230,Leonard,17, Thank you.,2,Big Bang Theory,11,2
8231,Sheldon,17," Of course, if SkyNet actually did exist in the future, a perfect way to infiltrate and destroy mankind would be to send Terminators back posing as actors who have played Terminators in popular films and television series, lulling us into a false sense of security, i.e., that's Summer Glau from The Sarah Connor Chronicles. No, Summer, don't kill me! I'm pro-robot! Ahh!",2,Big Bang Theory,371,62
8232,Leonard,17, At least he's off the train crap.,2,Big Bang Theory,34,7
8233,Sheldon,17, Whee!,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
8234,Howard,17," Sheldon, I owe you an apology. Taking the train was a stroke of brilliance! I've actually got a shot at a Terminator.",2,Big Bang Theory,118,22
8235,Raj,17," Oh, please.When it comes to Terminators, you've got a better shot of scoring with Arnold Schwarzenegger.",2,Big Bang Theory,105,16
8236,Howard,17," You're overlooking something. I have 11 hours with her in a confined space. Unless she's willing to jump off a moving train, tuck and roll down the side of a hill, she will eventually succumb to the acquired taste that is Howard Wolowitz.",2,Big Bang Theory,239,43
8237,Leonard,17, My money's on tuck and roll.,2,Big Bang Theory,29,6
8238,Sheldon,17, I'm confused. I thought you were involved in some sort of socially intimate pairing with Leslie Winkle.,2,Big Bang Theory,104,17
8239,Howard,17," Sheldon, let me explain to you how this works.",2,Big Bang Theory,47,9
8240,Sheldon,17, All right.,2,Big Bang Theory,11,2
8241,Howard,17, That's Summer Glau.,2,Big Bang Theory,20,3
8242,Sheldon,17, Yes.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
8243,Howard,17, That's it.,2,Big Bang Theory,11,2
8244,Raj,17, Hang on a sec. Why do you get first crack at her?,2,Big Bang Theory,50,12
8245,Howard,17," Um, well, let's see, couple reasons. One, I saw her first.",2,Big Bang Theory,59,11
8246,Raj,17," No, you didn't. I did.",2,Big Bang Theory,23,5
8247,Howard,17," Fair enough. But then let me move on to number two, unlike you, I can actually talk to women when I'm sober.",2,Big Bang Theory,109,22
8248,Raj,17," You fail to take into account that even mute, I am foreign and exotic, while you, on the other hand, are frail and pasty.",2,Big Bang Theory,122,24
8249,Howard,17," Well, you know the old saying, pasty and frail never fail.",2,Big Bang Theory,59,11
8250,Leonard,17," Excuse me, but what about me? Why don't I get a shot?",2,Big Bang Theory,54,12
8251,Howard,17," Fine, go ahead. Take a shot.",2,Big Bang Theory,29,6
8252,Leonard,17," You know, I've already got a gorgeous blonde back home at I can't score with. I think I'll let you two take this one.",2,Big Bang Theory,118,24
8253,Raj,17," Sheldon, is there a place on this train to get alcohol?",2,Big Bang Theory,56,11
8254,Sheldon,17," Interesting that you ask. The Coast Starlight recently added the refurbished Pacific Parlour Car. Built in 1956 and originally known as the Santa Fe Lounge Car, the lower level is a theatre",2,Big Bang Theory,190,32
8255,Raj,17," Yeah-yeah, which way?",2,Big Bang Theory,22,3
8256,Sheldon,17, and the upper level is a bar that offers wine tastings if you're going as far as Portland.,2,Big Bang Theory,91,18
8257,Leonard,17, So aren't you going to go talk to her?,2,Big Bang Theory,39,9
8258,Howard,17," I will, I'm just working on my opening line.",2,Big Bang Theory,45,9
8259,Leonard,17," She's probably heard every possible line, Howard. Why don't you just try hello?",2,Big Bang Theory,80,13
8260,Howard,17," No, no, no, that always creeps girls out. I need to come up with something that's funny, smart and delicately suggests that my sexual endowment is disproportionate to my physical stature.",2,Big Bang Theory,188,31
8261,Leonard,17, You're going to need more than 11 hours.,2,Big Bang Theory,41,8
8262,Sheldon,17," Oh, no.",2,Big Bang Theory,8,2
8263,Leonard,17, What's the matter?,2,Big Bang Theory,19,3
8264,Sheldon,17, I forgot my flash drive.,2,Big Bang Theory,25,5
8265,Leonard,17, So?,2,Big Bang Theory,4,1
8266,Sheldon,17, So we have to go back.,2,Big Bang Theory,23,6
8267,Leonard,17," Okay, Sheldon, I'm going to say why and your answer cannot be because I forgot my flash drive.",2,Big Bang Theory,95,18
8268,Sheldon,17, You don't understand. My flash drive has my paper on astrophysical probes of M-theory effects in the early universe that I was going to give to George Smoot at the conference.,2,Big Bang Theory,176,31
8269,Leonard,17, Why do you have to give your paper to George Smoot?,2,Big Bang Theory,52,11
8270,Sheldon,17, It's brilliant. He needs to read it.,2,Big Bang Theory,37,7
8271,Leonard,17, So you'll send him an e-mail when we get back.,2,Big Bang Theory,47,10
8272,Sheldon,17, Then I won't get to see his face light up as he reads it.,2,Big Bang Theory,58,14
8273,Leonard,17, Right. Of course.,2,Big Bang Theory,18,3
8274,Sheldon,17," Oh, this is an unmitigated disaster.",2,Big Bang Theory,37,6
8275,Leonard,17," Well, there's nothing you can do about it, so relax, sit back, enjoy the clickety-clack of the steel wheels on the polished rails.",2,Big Bang Theory,131,23
8276,Sheldon,17," You forgot your flash drive, You forgot your flash drive ",2,Big Bang Theory,58,10
8277,Leonard,17," Only ten hours, 55 minutes to go.",2,Big Bang Theory,34,7
8278,Howard,17," It's hot in here. Must be Summer.  So, where you gals headed?",2,Big Bang Theory,62,12
8279,Leonard,17, I've got a better idea.,2,Big Bang Theory,24,5
8280,Sheldon,17, Are you going to be sarcastic?,2,Big Bang Theory,31,6
8281,Leonard,17," Boy, you take all the fun out of it for me. But look, Penny's home. Why don't we just call her, have her go in the apartment, get your flash drive and e-mail you the paper?",2,Big Bang Theory,173,36
8282,Sheldon,17, But the flash drive is in a locked drawer in my desk.,2,Big Bang Theory,54,12
8283,Leonard,17, So?,2,Big Bang Theory,4,1
8284,Sheldon,17, The key is hidden in my room.,2,Big Bang Theory,30,7
8285,Leonard,17, So?,2,Big Bang Theory,4,1
8286,Sheldon,17, Penny would have to go into my room.,2,Big Bang Theory,37,8
8287,Leonard,17, So?,2,Big Bang Theory,4,1
8288,Sheldon,17, People don't go in my room!,2,Big Bang Theory,28,6
8289,Leonard,17," I see. Well, it seems once again, you're caught between a rock and a crazy place.",2,Big Bang Theory,82,16
8290,Sheldon,17," Oh, I hate when that happens.",2,Big Bang Theory,30,6
8291,Howard,17, It's hot in here. It must be Summer. It's hot in here. Must be Summer. It's hot in here. Must be Summer.,2,Big Bang Theory,105,22
8292,Raj,17, It's hot in here. Must be Summer.,2,Big Bang Theory,34,7
8294,Raj,17, Really? I just made it up. Have you seen Slumdog Millionaire?,2,Big Bang Theory,62,11
8296,Raj,17, It's loosely based on my life.,2,Big Bang Theory,31,6
8298,Penny,17," Yeah, we're putting the play on for one night in this little 99-seat theatre. Can you come? Oh, great. Do you know 98 other people that might want to come? Oh, hang on.  Hello?",2,Big Bang Theory,177,34
8299,Sheldon,17," Listen carefully. I'm about to give you a set of instructions, which you must follow to the letter.",2,Big Bang Theory,100,18
8300,Penny,17," Just a sec.  The theatre is above a bowling alley, so it's a little noisy, but it might be the only chance I'll ever get to play Anne Frank. And the director is brilliant. He uses the bowling sounds as, like, Nazi artillery. Okay, great, I'll see you then.  Hello?",2,Big Bang Theory,265,50
8301,Sheldon,17," Okay, step four. Do you see that small plastic case on my dresser?",2,Big Bang Theory,67,13
8302,Penny,17, Your dresser? Who is this?,2,Big Bang Theory,27,5
8303,Sheldon,17, It's Sheldon.,2,Big Bang Theory,14,2
8304,Penny,17," Oh, hey, Sheldon! How is San Francisco?",2,Big Bang Theory,40,7
8305,Sheldon,17, I'm not in San Francisco. I'm on a train. Were you even listening to me?,2,Big Bang Theory,73,15
8306,Penny,17," Uh, no, I was talking to my friend, but what's up?",2,Big Bang Theory,51,11
8307,Sheldon,17," What's up? I'll tell you what's up. I'm in a crisis situation, and I need you to marshal your powers of concentration, limited as they may be",2,Big Bang Theory,142,27
8308,Leonard,17," Give me the phone. Hi, Penny. It's Leonard.",2,Big Bang Theory,44,8
8309,Penny,17," Hey, Leonard. What's going on with Dr. Wackadoodle?",2,Big Bang Theory,52,8
8310,Leonard,17," He's calling to ask you a favour. You might be confused because he didn't use the words, Penny, Sheldon, please or favour.",2,Big Bang Theory,123,22
8311,Sheldon,17," Okay. Enough chitchat. Okay, step one, locate your emergency key to our apartment. Step two, enter our apartment. Step three, enter my bedroom.",2,Big Bang Theory,144,23
8312,Penny,17," Oh, hang on, Sheldon, getting another call.",2,Big Bang Theory,44,7
8313,Sheldon,17," No! Leonard, let me tell you something. Personal robots cannot get here soon enough.",2,Big Bang Theory,85,14
8314,Raj,17," And that bright little star peeking her head out early today, that's Venus.",2,Big Bang Theory,76,13
8316,Raj,17," Come on. When you were on TV in Firefly, you were actually in space.",2,Big Bang Theory,69,14
8318,Raj,17," You mean one of the hopeless geeks? No. Those are crazy people. Howard, be a dear and get me another one of these. Now, him, he's one of those geeks.",2,Big Bang Theory,150,30
8319,Sheldon,17," All right, now, before you enter my bedroom unescorted, I need you to understand that this onetime grant of access does not create a permanent easement. Easement. It's a legal right",2,Big Bang Theory,182,31
8320,Howard,17," Do you believe him? Normally around women, he has the personality of a boiled potato. Put one beer in him, and he's M. Night Charmalarmalon.",2,Big Bang Theory,141,25
8321,Leonard,17, Is that what he's drinking? It's not even real beer.,2,Big Bang Theory,53,10
8322,Howard,17, What?,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
8323,Leonard,17, Look at it. Non-alcoholic beer.,2,Big Bang Theory,32,5
8324,Howard,17, What's going on?,2,Big Bang Theory,17,3
8325,Leonard,17," I don't know. Some sort of placebo effect, I guess.",2,Big Bang Theory,52,10
8326,Howard,17," Placebo, you say. Interesting.",2,Big Bang Theory,31,4
8327,Sheldon,17," Yes, I'm still here. Where am I going? I'm on a train. Now, what you'll be looking for is a small wooden box located between a Hoberman's sphere and a sample of quartz flecked with pyrite. Hoberman's Sphere. It's a collapsible icosidodecahedron. No, the thing with the time on it is my alarm clock.",2,Big Bang Theory,299,54
8328,Raj,17," Actually, in India, the names of constellations are different. Where you have the Big Dipper, we have the Big Curry Pot.",2,Big Bang Theory,121,21
8330,Raj,17, You got me. Now what are you going to do with me?,2,Big Bang Theory,50,12
8331,Howard,17, Raj.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
8332,Raj,17, Yes?,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
8333,Howard,17, Look.,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
8334,Raj,17, What am I looking at?,2,Big Bang Theory,22,5
8335,Howard,17, You tell me.,2,Big Bang Theory,13,3
8336,Raj,17, Non-alcoholic bee-ee-eeuh ,2,Big Bang Theory,27,2
8337,Howard,17," Hi, I'm the small package good things come in.",2,Big Bang Theory,47,9
8338,Penny,17," Okay, I got a box, but there's no key in here. Just letters.",2,Big Bang Theory,61,13
8339,Sheldon,17, That's the wrong box. Put it back.,2,Big Bang Theory,35,7
8340,Penny,17," Oh, Sheldon, are these letters from your grandmother?",2,Big Bang Theory,54,8
8341,Sheldon,17, Don't read those letters!,2,Big Bang Theory,26,4
8342,Penny,17," Oh, look, she calls you Moon Pie. That is so cute.",2,Big Bang Theory,51,11
8343,Sheldon,17, Put down the letters!,2,Big Bang Theory,22,4
8344,Leonard,17," Hey, Penny. It's Leonard.",2,Big Bang Theory,26,4
8345,Penny,17," Hey, Leonard. How's the train ride?",2,Big Bang Theory,36,6
8346,Leonard,17," Delightful. Listen, I don't know what you're doing right now, but there are little bubbles forming on the corners of Sheldon's mouth.",2,Big Bang Theory,134,22
8347,Penny,17," Okay, yeah, I kind of crossed a line. Put him back on.",2,Big Bang Theory,55,12
8348,Leonard,17, Thank you.,2,Big Bang Theory,11,2
8349,Sheldon,17, I'm back.,2,Big Bang Theory,10,2
8350,Penny,17," What up, Moon Pie?",2,Big Bang Theory,19,4
8351,Sheldon,17, Nobody calls me Moon Pie but Meemaw!,2,Big Bang Theory,37,7
8352,Leonard,17," Hey, Penny. Leonard again.",2,Big Bang Theory,27,4
8353,Howard,17," So anyway, in the dream, you and I were ice skating, just the two of us. And then, I picked you up by your ankles and twirled you round and round until your legs tore off. I tried to stick them back on, but before I could, you turned into a giant loaf of pumpernickel bread. What do you think that means?",2,Big Bang Theory,305,62
8355,Howard,17, I'll give you a little clue. My favourite sandwich? Salami on pumpernickel.,2,Big Bang Theory,76,12
8357,Howard,17," And did you know the word â€œpumpernickelâ€ù comes from the German words pumper and nickel, which loosely translates to fart goblin?",2,Big Bang Theory,133,21
8359,Penny,17," Okay, I found the box. Now what?",2,Big Bang Theory,33,7
8360,Sheldon,17," You're holding a Japanese puzzle box, which takes ten precise moves to open. First, locate the panel with the diamond pattern and slide the centre portion one millimetre to the left. Then, on the opposite end of the box, slide the entire panel down two millimetres. You'll hear a slight click.",2,Big Bang Theory,294,51
8361,Penny,17," Hang on. Sheldon, do you have any emotional attachment to this box?",2,Big Bang Theory,68,12
8362,Sheldon,17," No, it's a novelty I ordered off the Internet. Now, did you hear the click?",2,Big Bang Theory,76,15
8363,Penny,17, Not yet. There it is.,2,Big Bang Theory,22,5
8364,Howard,17," Okay, here's another one. If you married the famous rock guitarist Johnny Winter, you'd be Summer Winter.",2,Big Bang Theory,106,17
8366,Howard,17," Okay, I'm going to just go for broke here and say I like you.",2,Big Bang Theory,62,14
8368,Howard,17," So here's my question, do you realistically see any conversational path that would take me from where we are right now to a place where I could ask you out and you'd say yes?",2,Big Bang Theory,175,34
8370,Howard,17, Fair enough. I'll leave you in peace.,2,Big Bang Theory,38,7
8372,Howard,17," But before I go, would you mind if I just take one picture of us together for my Facebook page?",2,Big Bang Theory,96,20
8374,Howard,17," Okay. Great. Now, can I take one where it looks like we're making out?",2,Big Bang Theory,71,14
8375,Sheldon,17," Okay, now you're going to insert the flash drive into the USB port. She calls me Moon Pie because I'm nummy-nummy and she could just eat me up, now, please put the flash drive in the USB port. The one that looks like a little duck's mouth.",2,Big Bang Theory,240,47
8376,Leonard,17," Hey, how'd it go?",2,Big Bang Theory,18,4
8377,Howard,17, Terminator broke my phone.,2,Big Bang Theory,27,4
8378,Leonard,17," Excuse me.  Okay, I'll be honest with you. I've just spent the last two hours imagining various scenarios in my head, trying to come up with some clever line to say to you. But then I finally realized you're a human being; I'm a human being. I could just say to you",2,Big Bang Theory,266,52
8380,Leonard,17," Hi, my name's Leonard.",2,Big Bang Theory,23,4
8382,Sheldon,17," So, I'm thinking, you won the Nobel Prize what, three years ago? So you must deal with a whole lot of what has Smoot done lately? My thought is we continue my research as a team, you know, Cooper-Smoot, alphabetical, and when we win the Nobel Prize, you'll be back on top.",2,Big Bang Theory,273,52
8384,Sheldon,17," Fine! Smoot-Cooper. Wow, what a diva.",2,Big Bang Theory,38,6
8386,Raj,18, Knight to queen's bishop-five.,2,Big Bang Theory,31,4
8387,Howard,18," Oh, very nice. What's Leonard going to do? Does he give up the pawn or does he give up the position?",2,Big Bang Theory,101,21
8388,Raj,18," Let's find out. Leonard, ready?",2,Big Bang Theory,32,5
8389,Leonard,18, Ready.,2,Big Bang Theory,7,1
8390,Raj,18, Go. ,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
8391,Leonard,18, Damn it. I slipped.,2,Big Bang Theory,20,4
8392,Howard,18," Too bad. You know the rules of Secret Agent Laser Obstacle Chess. Uh, Leonard died again, Sheldon. You're up.",2,Big Bang Theory,110,19
8393,Sheldon,18," Despite my deep love of chess, lasers and aerosol disinfectant, I must forfeit.",2,Big Bang Theory,80,13
8394,Leonard,18, Why?,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
8395,Sheldon,18, â€“ Because it's almost eleven o'clock.,2,Big Bang Theory,40,6
8396,Leonard,18, So?,2,Big Bang Theory,4,1
8397,Sheldon,18," So, Penny has a don't knock on my door before eleven o'clock or I punch you in the throat rule.",2,Big Bang Theory,96,20
8399,Howard,18," Hey, you know what'd be a great idea? We get some girls over here and play Laser Obstacle Strip Chess.",2,Big Bang Theory,103,20
8400,Leonard,18," Believe me, Howard, any girl who would be willing to play that, you don't want to see naked.",2,Big Bang Theory,93,18
8401,Howard,18, You underestimate me.,2,Big Bang Theory,22,3
8403,Sheldon,18,"  Penny,  Penny,  Penny.",2,Big Bang Theory,24,3
8404,Penny,18," Hey, Sheldon.",2,Big Bang Theory,14,2
8405,Sheldon,18, It's eleven am.,2,Big Bang Theory,16,3
8406,Penny,18, I know. You're safe.,2,Big Bang Theory,21,4
8407,Sheldon,18, This package came while you were at work.,2,Big Bang Theory,42,8
8408,Penny,18," Oh, great, my rhinestones. Thank you.",2,Big Bang Theory,38,6
8409,Sheldon,18, Excuse me.,2,Big Bang Theory,11,2
8410,Penny,18, What?,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
8411,Sheldon,18, You have to sign this.,2,Big Bang Theory,23,5
8412,Penny,18, What is it?,2,Big Bang Theory,12,3
8413,Sheldon,18," When I signed for the package, I was deputized by the United Parcel Service and entrusted with its final delivery. I now need you to acknowledge receipt of the package so that I'm fully indemnified and no longer liable.",2,Big Bang Theory,220,39
8414,Penny,18," Sheldon, it's just a box of rhinestones.",2,Big Bang Theory,41,7
8415,Sheldon,18," Well, the contents are irrelevant. A legal bailment has been created. Does that mean nothing to you?",2,Big Bang Theory,101,17
8416,Penny,18," It means nothing to anybody. Come here, let me show you what I'm doing.",2,Big Bang Theory,72,14
8417,Sheldon,18," Bailment describes a relationship in common law where a physical possession of personal property, or chattels, is transferred from one person, the bailor, to another person, the bailee.",2,Big Bang Theory,186,28
8418,Penny,18," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Look, look, look! I started a business.",2,Big Bang Theory,64,11
8419,Sheldon,18," Obviously, not a cleaning business.",2,Big Bang Theory,36,5
8420,Penny,18," No, I'm making flower barrettes. See? I call them Penny Blossoms. I made one for myself, then all the girls at work wanted one. Then I showed some to this lady who runs a shop in Old Town. She sells cards and homemade jewellery. She said she wanted to sell them. I said okay, and in one week, I made a $156.",2,Big Bang Theory,308,62
8421,Sheldon,18, Good for you. Sign here.,2,Big Bang Theory,25,5
8422,Penny,18," Sheldon, don't you get it? If this takes off, I won't have to be a waitress anymore.",2,Big Bang Theory,85,17
8423,Sheldon,18, But then who will bring me my cheeseburger on Tuesday nights?,2,Big Bang Theory,62,11
8424,Penny,18, Another waitress.,2,Big Bang Theory,18,2
8425,Sheldon,18, What's her name?,2,Big Bang Theory,17,3
8426,Penny,18, I don't know.,2,Big Bang Theory,14,3
8427,Sheldon,18, And you're going to let her handle my food?,2,Big Bang Theory,44,9
8428,Penny,18, Nancy. Her name is Nancy.,2,Big Bang Theory,26,5
8429,Sheldon,18, I think you're just making that up.,2,Big Bang Theory,36,7
8430,Penny,18," Sheldon, I'm sorry about your hamburger, okay? I just don't want to be a waitress for the rest of my life.",2,Big Bang Theory,107,21
8431,Leonard,18, Cheeseburger. I get a cheeseburger.,2,Big Bang Theory,36,5
8432,Penny,18," Fine, cheeseburger.",2,Big Bang Theory,20,2
8433,Sheldon,18, Maybe I'd be better off with Nancy.,2,Big Bang Theory,36,7
8434,Penny,18," So, what do you think? I mean, this could be a business, right?",2,Big Bang Theory,64,13
8435,Sheldon,18, How many of these can you make a day?,2,Big Bang Theory,38,9
8436,Penny,18, About twenty.,2,Big Bang Theory,14,2
8437,Sheldon,18, And how much profit do you make per Penny Blossom?,2,Big Bang Theory,51,10
8438,Penny,18," I don't know, like, 50 cents. I'm not sure.",2,Big Bang Theory,44,9
8439,Sheldon,18," No, Of course you're not. All right, ten dollars a day times five days a week times 52 weeks a year is two thousand six hundred dollars.",2,Big Bang Theory,137,27
8440,Penny,18, That's all?,2,Big Bang Theory,12,2
8441,Sheldon,18, Before taxes.,2,Big Bang Theory,14,2
8442,Penny,18," Well, I don't have to pay taxes on this stuff.",2,Big Bang Theory,47,10
8443,Sheldon,18," I believe the Internal Revenue Service would strongly disagree. But, if you took advantage of modern marketing techniques, and you optimized your manufacturing process, you might be able to make this a viable business.",2,Big Bang Theory,219,34
8444,Penny,18, And you know about that stuff?,2,Big Bang Theory,31,6
8445,Sheldon,18," Penny, I'm a physicist. I have a working knowledge of the entire universe and everything it contains.",2,Big Bang Theory,102,17
8446,Penny,18, Who's Radiohead?,2,Big Bang Theory,17,2
8447,Sheldon,18, I have a working knowledge of the important things in the universe. Good luck.,2,Big Bang Theory,79,14
8448,Penny,18," Sheldon, hold on. Could you maybe show me how to make more money with this?",2,Big Bang Theory,76,15
8449,Sheldon,18, Of course I could.,2,Big Bang Theory,19,4
8450,Penny,18," Sheldon, wait! Will you?",2,Big Bang Theory,25,4
8451,Sheldon,18," Just to be clear here, you're asking for my assistance.",2,Big Bang Theory,56,10
8452,Penny,18, Yes.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
8453,Sheldon,18, And you understand that will involve me telling you what to do?,2,Big Bang Theory,64,12
8454,Penny,18, I understand.,2,Big Bang Theory,14,2
8455,Sheldon,18, And you're not allowed to be sarcastic or snide to me while I'm doing so.,2,Big Bang Theory,74,15
8456,Penny,18, Okay.,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
8457,Sheldon,18, Good. Let's begin with the premise that everything you've done up to this point is wrong.,2,Big Bang Theory,90,16
8458,Penny,18," Oh, imagine that.",2,Big Bang Theory,18,3
8459,Sheldon,18, Sarcasm. Good-bye.,2,Big Bang Theory,19,2
8460,Penny,18," No, sorry. Wait! Please come back!",2,Big Bang Theory,35,6
8462,Penny,18, There. Done.,2,Big Bang Theory,13,2
8463,Sheldon,18, All right. 12 minutes and 17 seconds.,2,Big Bang Theory,38,7
8464,Penny,18," Pretty good, right?",2,Big Bang Theory,20,3
8465,Sheldon,18," That's 4.9 Penny Blossoms per hour. Based on your cost of materials and your wholesale selling price, you'll effectively be paying yourself $5.19 a day.",2,Big Bang Theory,153,25
8466,Penny,18, A day?,2,Big Bang Theory,7,2
8467,Sheldon,18, There are children in a sneaker factory in Indonesia who outearn you.,2,Big Bang Theory,70,12
8468,Penny,18, That just can't be right.,2,Big Bang Theory,26,5
8469,Sheldon,18, You're questioning my math?,2,Big Bang Theory,28,4
8470,Penny,18," No, sorry.",2,Big Bang Theory,11,2
8471,Sheldon,18, Want me to show my work?,2,Big Bang Theory,25,6
8472,Penny,18," Oh, God, no, no. Just please tell me what to do about it.",2,Big Bang Theory,58,13
8473,Sheldon,18," All right, are you familiar with the development that resulted from HonorÃ© Blanc's 1778 use of interchangeable parts? The assembly line, of course.",2,Big Bang Theory,149,23
8474,Penny,18," Okay, you know what, if I'm not allowed to be snide, you're not allowed to be condescending.",2,Big Bang Theory,93,17
8475,Sheldon,18," That wasn't a part of our original agreement, and I do not agree to it now.",2,Big Bang Theory,76,16
8476,Penny,18," All right, fine. How are we supposed to set up machines and conveyor belts in my apartment?",2,Big Bang Theory,92,17
8477,Sheldon,18," You're thinking of the moving assembly line, an understandable but not excusable mistake. No. The moving assembly line, that was introduced by Henry Ford in 1908. That innovation is what made possible our modern consumer culture by enabling a low-unit cost for manufactured goods. I guess that isn't one of the topics discussed on your Radiohead.",2,Big Bang Theory,347,56
8479,Leonard,18, Let's go. We're going to miss the coming attractions.,2,Big Bang Theory,54,9
8480,Raj,18, What's the matter?,2,Big Bang Theory,19,3
8481,Howard,18, I think I bruised a testicle capturing that last pawn.,2,Big Bang Theory,55,10
8482,Leonard,18, Hello?,2,Big Bang Theory,7,1
8484,Leonard,18," W-W-Wait, what's going on?",2,Big Bang Theory,27,4
8485,Sheldon,18, I assume you're referring to the sea shanty. It's a rhythmic work song designed to increase productivity.,2,Big Bang Theory,106,17
8486,Penny,18," Yeah, it's crazy, but it totally works. Look, we made this Penny Blossom in under three minutes.",2,Big Bang Theory,97,17
8487,Leonard,18," Terrific, but that kind of raises more questions than it answers.",2,Big Bang Theory,66,11
8488,Sheldon,18," Penny's making hair accessories. I'm helping her optimize her manufacturing process. All right, break's over. ",2,Big Bang Theory,111,15
8489,Howard,18, Hold on. What are you using as a bonding agent?,2,Big Bang Theory,48,10
8490,Sheldon,18, Hot glue.,2,Big Bang Theory,10,2
8491,Howard,18, You're kidding. Any of the cyanoacrylates would do a better job.,2,Big Bang Theory,65,11
8492,Sheldon,18," It won't work, the flower's too porous.",2,Big Bang Theory,40,7
8493,Leonard,18, What if we infused the bottom layer with silicone-RTV to provide a better mounting surface?,2,Big Bang Theory,92,15
8494,Sheldon,18, Intriguing.,2,Big Bang Theory,12,1
8495,Howard,18," Good question, what are you marketing and distribution channels?",2,Big Bang Theory,65,9
8496,Penny,18," Well, there are the waitresses at my work, and this cute, little shop in Old Town.",2,Big Bang Theory,83,16
8497,Sheldon,18," Hush, hush, hush, hush, hush, virtually non-existent. I'm thinking that we set her up with a hosted turnkey e-commerce system to start.",2,Big Bang Theory,136,22
8498,Howard,18, Why not eliminate the middle man? We could install a small server farm with a static IP in her bedroom.,2,Big Bang Theory,104,20
8499,Leonard,18, She'd need some kind of industrial cooling system.,2,Big Bang Theory,51,8
8500,Sheldon,18," Of course, but before we set up a marketing and distribution infrastructure, we should finish optimizing the manufacturing process. To start with, she has a terrible problem with moisture-induced glitter clump.",2,Big Bang Theory,211,31
8501,Penny,18," Yeah, it's a bitch.",2,Big Bang Theory,20,4
8502,Howard,18," Uh, I've seen this before.",2,Big Bang Theory,27,5
8503,Leonard,18, Where?,2,Big Bang Theory,7,1
8504,Howard,18," It's a common stripper problem. They dance, they sweat, they clump.",2,Big Bang Theory,68,11
8505,Penny,18, Ew.,2,Big Bang Theory,4,1
8506,Leonard,18, Are you thinking about adding a desiccant like calcium sulphate?,2,Big Bang Theory,65,10
8507,Howard,18," Actually, I'm thinking about this one stripper named Vega. But sure, calcium sulphate could work.",2,Big Bang Theory,98,15
8508,Sheldon,18, Let's think out of the box for a moment. How about a molecular sieve?,2,Big Bang Theory,70,14
8510,Penny,18, I've got a spaghetti strainer in the kitchen.,2,Big Bang Theory,46,8
8511,Sheldon,18, Wow.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
8512,Leonard,18," Hey, we could liberate some micro-porous charcoal from the chem lab.",2,Big Bang Theory,69,11
8513,Sheldon,18," Oh, great. Raj, why don't you and Howard go get the charcoal? Leonard, why don't you start working on some preliminary Web site designs. I'll make some space in our apartment so we can move the manufacturing process.",2,Big Bang Theory,217,38
8514,Penny,18," Well, what's wrong with my apartment?",2,Big Bang Theory,38,6
8515,Sheldon,18, It's not my apartment.,2,Big Bang Theory,23,4
8516,Penny,18," Wait, wait, what am I going to do?",2,Big Bang Theory,35,8
8517,Leonard,18," Uh, hey, it's your business. Do whatever you want.",2,Big Bang Theory,51,9
8518,Penny,18," Oh, okay, cool. I'm going to take a nap.",2,Big Bang Theory,41,9
8520,Leonard,18," I'm still tweaking things a little bit, but this will give you the general idea of the Web site. So, what do you guys think?",2,Big Bang Theory,125,25
8521,Howard,18," Uh, pretty much any way I say that is going to hurt his feelings.",2,Big Bang Theory,66,14
8522,Leonard,18," Okay, what's wrong with it?",2,Big Bang Theory,28,5
8523,Sheldon,18, â€“ What's wrong with it?,2,Big Bang Theory,26,5
8524,Leonard,18, Not you. I wasn't asking you. Penny?,2,Big Bang Theory,37,7
8525,Penny,18," Uh, well, it's a little juvenile. I mean, it kind of looks like the MySpace page of a 13-year-old girl.",2,Big Bang Theory,104,20
8526,Leonard,18," No, it doesn't.",2,Big Bang Theory,16,3
8527,Howard,18, Please. Dateline could use it to attract predators.,2,Big Bang Theory,52,8
8528,Sheldon,18," Penny, this is your enterprise, so it's ultimately your decision, but based on the quality of his work, I'd strongly recommend that we let Leonard go.",2,Big Bang Theory,151,26
8529,Leonard,18, You want to fire me?,2,Big Bang Theory,21,5
8530,Sheldon,18, What I want is irrelevant. This is Penny's decision. Penny?,2,Big Bang Theory,60,10
8531,Leonard,18," Excuse me, but if I did such a bad job then why do we already have orders?",2,Big Bang Theory,75,17
8532,Penny,18, We do?,2,Big Bang Theory,7,2
8533,Leonard,18," Uh-huh. Look. Mrs. Fiona Fondell from Huntsville, Alabama has ordered two.",2,Big Bang Theory,75,11
8534,Penny,18, No kidding. Two?,2,Big Bang Theory,17,3
8535,Leonard,18, Uh-huh. Look at the comments.,2,Big Bang Theory,30,5
8536,Penny,18," Thank you, Penny Blossoms. These will be perfect to cover my bald spot. Aww, that is so sweet.",2,Big Bang Theory,95,18
8537,Sheldon,18, Camouflaging bald spots. That's primarily a male concern. Perhaps we could expand our market.,2,Big Bang Theory,94,14
8538,Penny,18, How are flower barrettes going to appeal to men?,2,Big Bang Theory,49,9
8539,Howard,18, We add Bluetooth!,2,Big Bang Theory,18,3
8540,Sheldon,18, Brilliant. Men love Bluetooth.,2,Big Bang Theory,31,4
8541,Penny,18," Wait a minute, wait a minute, you want to make a hair barrette with Bluetooth?",2,Big Bang Theory,79,15
8542,Sheldon,18," Penny, everything is better with Bluetooth.",2,Big Bang Theory,44,6
8543,Leonard,18, Holy crap. Someone just ordered a thousand Penny Blossoms.,2,Big Bang Theory,59,9
8544,Penny,18, Get out! Who needs a thousand sparkly flower barrettes with rhinestones?,2,Big Bang Theory,73,11
8545,Leonard,18," The Fifth Annual East Rutherford, New Jersey, Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Alliance Luau.",2,Big Bang Theory,100,14
8546,Sheldon,18," Oh, another market to expand into, balding gay men.",2,Big Bang Theory,52,9
8547,Howard,18, And I'll bet lesbians love Bluetooth.,2,Big Bang Theory,38,6
8548,Sheldon,18, We should get to work.,2,Big Bang Theory,23,5
8549,Penny,18," Wait, wait, wait, why does it say one-day rush? Since when do we offer a one-day rush?",2,Big Bang Theory,87,17
8550,Leonard,18, Amazon offers one-day rush.,2,Big Bang Theory,28,4
8551,Penny,18," Yeah, but they don't have to glue the books together. How the hell are we going to make a thousand Penny Blossoms in one day?",2,Big Bang Theory,126,25
8552,Leonard,18, Don't yell at me. I'm not manufacturing. I'm just Web design.,2,Big Bang Theory,62,11
8553,Penny,18," Okay, well, I'm gonna have to call them and cancel the order.",2,Big Bang Theory,62,12
8554,Sheldon,18," Excuse me, but was this not your goal? Financial independence through entrepreneurial brilliance and innovation? My brilliance and innovation, of course, but still.",2,Big Bang Theory,165,23
8555,Penny,18, I just don't see how see can pull this off.,2,Big Bang Theory,44,10
8556,Sheldon,18," Okay, that, right there, that equivocation and self-doubt, that is not the American spirit. Did Davy Crockett quit at the Alamo? Did Jim Bowie?",2,Big Bang Theory,144,24
8557,Howard,18," They didn't quit. They were massacred by, like, a gazillion angry Mexicans.",2,Big Bang Theory,76,12
8558,Sheldon,18," Alright, let me put it this way. Your gross receipts on this one order will be over $3,000 for one night's work.",2,Big Bang Theory,113,22
8559,Penny,18, You guys get started.,2,Big Bang Theory,22,4
8560,Leonard,18, What are you doing?,2,Big Bang Theory,20,4
8561,Penny,18, Going online to buy shoes!,2,Big Bang Theory,27,5
8563,Raj,18," You know, if I wanted to spend my Saturday nights doing this, I could have stayed in India.",2,Big Bang Theory,92,18
8564,Howard,18," Oh, stop with the fake third world crap. Your father's a gynaecologist, and you had a house full of servants.",2,Big Bang Theory,110,20
8565,Raj,18, We only had four servants. And two of them were children.,2,Big Bang Theory,58,11
8566,Leonard,18, How are we doing?,2,Big Bang Theory,18,4
8567,Raj,18, We have 128 assorted Penny Blossoms ready to ship.,2,Big Bang Theory,51,9
8568,Howard,18," Oh, God, we're never gonna finish in time. Who made Sheldon the boss anyway?",2,Big Bang Theory,77,14
8569,Sheldon,18, I believe I'm hearing some negativity on the factory floor.,2,Big Bang Theory,60,10
8570,Penny,18, So?,2,Big Bang Theory,4,1
8571,Sheldon,18," Penny, the labour force is a living organism that must be carefully nurtured. Any counterproductive grumbling must be skilfully headed off by management. Observe. Hey! Less talk, more work!",2,Big Bang Theory,190,29
8572,Penny,18, Nicely done.,2,Big Bang Theory,13,2
8573,Sheldon,18," Thank you. You hear any union talk, you let me know.",2,Big Bang Theory,53,11
8574,Leonard,18, Someone's in the kitchen with Dinah,2,Big Bang Theory,36,6
8575,Howard,18, Someone's in the kitchen I know-ow-ow-ow,2,Big Bang Theory,41,6
8576,Penny,18, Someone's in the kitchen with Dinah Sheldon? Sheldon! ,2,Big Bang Theory,55,8
8577,Sheldon,18, â€˜Cause I sold my soul to the company store.,2,Big Bang Theory,46,9
8578,Penny,18," Honey, do you want some coffee?",2,Big Bang Theory,32,6
8579,Sheldon,18," No, I don't drink coffee.",2,Big Bang Theory,26,5
8580,Penny,18," Come on, but if you don't stay awake we'll never finish in time.",2,Big Bang Theory,65,13
8581,Sheldon,18," I'm sorry, coffee's out of the question. When I moved to California, I promised my mother that I wouldn't start doing drugs.",2,Big Bang Theory,125,22
8582,Penny,18," Leonard, help.",2,Big Bang Theory,15,2
8583,Leonard,18," Sheldon, we still have 380 of these things to make.",2,Big Bang Theory,52,10
8584,Sheldon,18, I have complete faith that you will make them. Good night.,2,Big Bang Theory,59,11
8585,Penny,18, Leonard?,2,Big Bang Theory,9,1
8586,Leonard,18," Yeah, no. But, Sheldon, without your insight and leadership this entire enterprise will surely fail.",2,Big Bang Theory,101,15
8587,Sheldon,18," You're right, of course.",2,Big Bang Theory,25,4
8588,Penny,18," Here, this will help.",2,Big Bang Theory,22,4
8589,Sheldon,18," Very well, but if this leads to opiates or hallucinogenics, you're going to have to answer to my mother.",2,Big Bang Theory,105,19
8590,Sheldon,18," Look at Planck's Constant. People say it's arbitrary. It could not be less arbitrary. If it varied even slightly, life as we know it would not exist. Bam! Now, now, let's reconsider the entire argument, but with entropy reversed and effect preceding cause, so you are thinking of a universe that's not expanding from the centre, no, it is retreating from a, from a possibility space. Bam! This is a space where we are all essentially Alice through the looking glass, standing in front the Red Queen, and we're being offered a cracker to quench our thirst. Bam! Of course, in another universe, let's call it universe prime, there's another Sheldon, let's call him Sheldon prime",2,Big Bang Theory,677,116
8591,Penny,18, We should have let him go to bed.,2,Big Bang Theory,34,8
8592,Leonard,18, Bam.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
8593,Leonard,18, I can't believe we actually did it.,2,Big Bang Theory,36,7
8594,Howard,18," 1,000 friggin' Penny Blossoms.",2,Big Bang Theory,31,4
8595,Penny,18," I just want you guys to know I am really grateful for your help, and for every dollar I make, I'm going to give you 20 cents.",2,Big Bang Theory,126,27
8596,Howard,18, That's your entire profit margin.,2,Big Bang Theory,34,5
8597,Penny,18, Oh. Then never mind.,2,Big Bang Theory,21,4
8598,Leonard,18, I'll print out the shipping label. Uh-oh.,2,Big Bang Theory,42,7
8599,Penny,18, What?,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
8600,Leonard,18," We got an e-mail from the East Rutherford, New Jersey, Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Alliance. They want another thousand Penny Blossoms.",2,Big Bang Theory,147,22
8601,Penny,18, Really?,2,Big Bang Theory,8,1
8602,Leonard,18, One-day rush. I really need to take that off the Web site.,2,Big Bang Theory,59,12
8603,Penny,18," Okay, well. Guess we'd better get started.",2,Big Bang Theory,43,7
8604,Howard,18, You can't be serious.,2,Big Bang Theory,22,4
8605,Penny,18, Come on. What about the living organism of the workforce and the American spirit and Jiminy Crockett at the Alamo?,2,Big Bang Theory,115,20
8606,Leonard,18, Davy Crockett. Jiminy Crockett was a cricket.,2,Big Bang Theory,46,7
8607,Penny,18," Yes, yes, I know that, okay? I'm tired, I've had like 18 cups of coffee. The point is, if we all just pull together, we can do this. Who's with me?",2,Big Bang Theory,148,31
8608,Howard,18," Penny, although you may find it hard to believe, we do have lives.",2,Big Bang Theory,67,13
8609,Penny,18, Leonard?,2,Big Bang Theory,9,1
8610,Leonard,18," Sorry. My apologies to the gay community of East Rutherford, New Jersey.",2,Big Bang Theory,73,12
8611,Sheldon,18," Zoom, zoom, zoom! Where's the coffee?",2,Big Bang Theory,38,6
8612,Penny,18, We're all out.,2,Big Bang Theory,15,3
8613,Sheldon,18," No problem. I'll be back before this banana hits the ground. Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom! Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom!",2,Big Bang Theory,109,19
8615,Raj,18, Yes! ,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
8616,Howard,18," Sorry, guys, but Secret Agent Laser Obstacle Lunch is just stupid.",2,Big Bang Theory,67,11
8618,Penny,19," Okay, it's done. Look, guys, for the future, I don't mind killing the big spiders, but you have to at least try with the little ones.",2,Big Bang Theory,134,26
8619,Sheldon,19," Penny, please, we're facing a far more serious problem than stray arachnids.",2,Big Bang Theory,77,12
8620,Leonard,19," Sheldon, it's not that bad.",2,Big Bang Theory,28,5
8621,Sheldon,19," Not bad? It's horrible. I mean, you hear stories about this sort of thing, but you never think it'll happen to you.",2,Big Bang Theory,116,22
8622,Leonard,19," So they steamed your dumplings, get over it. New topic, please.",2,Big Bang Theory,64,11
8623,Howard,19," All right, Penny, let me take this opportunity to point out that you are looking particularly ravishing today.",2,Big Bang Theory,111,18
8624,Penny,19," Not with a thousand condoms, Howard.",2,Big Bang Theory,37,6
8625,Howard,19," So, there is a number.",2,Big Bang Theory,23,5
8626,Penny,19," Okay, new topic, please. Hey, did you hear the people upstairs in 5A are moving out?",2,Big Bang Theory,85,16
8627,Leonard,19, Shh-shh-shh!,2,Big Bang Theory,13,1
8628,Sheldon,19, What?,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
8629,Penny,19, The people upstairs are moving out.,2,Big Bang Theory,36,6
8630,Leonard,19, No!,2,Big Bang Theory,4,1
8631,Sheldon,19, The horror!,2,Big Bang Theory,12,2
8632,Leonard,19, Why would you just say something like that?,2,Big Bang Theory,44,8
8633,Sheldon,19," No, no, no, no, no, no, no",2,Big Bang Theory,27,7
8634,Penny,19, How else was I supposed to say it?,2,Big Bang Theory,35,8
8635,Leonard,19," Slowly, like putting a new fish in a tank. You don't just drop it in, you let the bag sit in the water a while.",2,Big Bang Theory,112,25
8636,Sheldon,19, The horror!,2,Big Bang Theory,12,2
8637,Penny,19," Sheldon, I'm sure it's going to be fine.",2,Big Bang Theory,41,8
8638,Sheldon,19," No, it's not going to be fine, change is never fine. They say it is, but it's not.",2,Big Bang Theory,83,18
8639,Penny,19," Okay, honey, did you even know the people that are moving out?",2,Big Bang Theory,63,12
8640,Sheldon,19," I never met them. That's what made them perfect, there were no awkward hellos in the halls, there was no clickety-clacking of high heel shoes on hardwood floors, they may as well have been a family of cats just jumping around from drape to drape without that annoying ammonia urine smell.",2,Big Bang Theory,289,51
8641,Penny,19," Well, I'm sure the new people will be just as quiet.",2,Big Bang Theory,53,11
8642,Sheldon,19, You can't know that. How can you possibly know that?,2,Big Bang Theory,53,10
8643,Penny,19," You're right, I can't. You know what? Anyone could rent that apartment now, an opera singer, the cast of stomp, yeah, a tap-dancing pirate with a wooden leg.",2,Big Bang Theory,158,28
8644,Leonard,19, Why are you making it worse?,2,Big Bang Theory,29,6
8645,Penny,19," I tried making it better, he wouldn't go for it.",2,Big Bang Theory,49,10
8646,Howard,19," You're right, that's a great idea.",2,Big Bang Theory,35,6
8647,Leonard,19, What?,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
8648,Howard,19," I'll take the apartment upstairs. I can finally get away from my mother, and we can all spend some more time together, if you catch my drift.",2,Big Bang Theory,142,27
8649,Penny,19, The horror!,2,Big Bang Theory,12,2
8651,Sheldon,19," Hold on. You honestly expect me to believe that social protocol dictates we break our backs helping Wolowitz move, and then he only need buy us a pizza?",2,Big Bang Theory,153,28
8652,Leonard,19," I'm sorry, that really is how it works.",2,Big Bang Theory,40,8
8653,Sheldon,19," You're tricking me. You tell me the truth, what do we get?",2,Big Bang Theory,59,12
8654,Leonard,19," Raj, help me out here.",2,Big Bang Theory,23,5
8655,Raj,19, You get to choose between a mountain bike or a PS3.,2,Big Bang Theory,52,11
8656,Sheldon,19," I knew it! PS3, definitely PS3, who would pick a mountain bike?",2,Big Bang Theory,64,12
8657,Howard,19," Enough with the guilt, ma, we'll still see each other. I'll come over every night and have dinner with you.",2,Big Bang Theory,108,20
8659,Howard,19," Okay, I get it, you're angry. You don't want to see your little bird leave the nest.",2,Big Bang Theory,85,17
8661,Howard,19," Fine, I'll stay! You happy, crazy lady? I sure as hell hope so, because you're ruining my life!",2,Big Bang Theory,96,18
8662,Leonard,19," Hey, Penny, it's Leonard. Good news, you can take your head out of the oven.",2,Big Bang Theory,77,15
8663,Sheldon,19, I guess I won't be needing this.,2,Big Bang Theory,33,7
8665,Sheldon,19," Oh, no, the new ones, they're here.",2,Big Bang Theory,36,7
8666,Leonard,19," Stay calm, we don't know anything about them yet. What are you doing?",2,Big Bang Theory,70,13
8667,Sheldon,19, I'm checking for musical instruments. Does that sound like castanets to you?,2,Big Bang Theory,77,12
8668,Leonard,19, The box says kitchen.,2,Big Bang Theory,22,4
8669,Sheldon,19, So? Do cocaine smugglers write cocaine on the box?,2,Big Bang Theory,51,9
8671,Leonard,19, Hello.,2,Big Bang Theory,7,1
8672,Sheldon,19, Hello.,2,Big Bang Theory,7,1
8674,Leonard,19, Hello.,2,Big Bang Theory,7,1
8675,Sheldon,19, Hello.,2,Big Bang Theory,7,1
8677,Leonard,19," That is so great. Oh, I'm Leonard, I live downstairs. Upstairs from here, but under you. Not under you per se, but under your apartment.",2,Big Bang Theory,137,25
8679,Leonard,19," Yeah, it is.",2,Big Bang Theory,13,3
8680,Sheldon,19," If that concludes your faltering attempt to mate, hello.",2,Big Bang Theory,57,9
8682,Sheldon,19, Hello. On a scale of one to ten how light of foot would you describe yourself with one being not cat-like at all and ten being freakishly feline?,2,Big Bang Theory,146,28
8684,Sheldon,19, Is that your answer or do you not understand the question? We'll come back to that one.,2,Big Bang Theory,88,17
8685,Leonard,19, Sheldon,2,Big Bang Theory,8,1
8686,Sheldon,19," Hang on. Are you now or have you ever been a salsa, Irish folk or break-dancer?",2,Big Bang Theory,80,16
8688,Leonard,19, You're making her uncomfortable.,2,Big Bang Theory,33,4
8689,Sheldon,19," Oh, I'm sorry. Well, if it helps you feel any better you're doing very well so far. Next question, are you fertile?",2,Big Bang Theory,116,22
8691,Sheldon,19, I'm trying to determine whether crying infants above my head are a possibility.,2,Big Bang Theory,80,13
8693,Sheldon,19," If that changes, let me know. And finally, area rugs, pro or con?",2,Big Bang Theory,66,13
8695,Sheldon,19, Alicia?,2,Big Bang Theory,8,1
8697,Sheldon,19, Welcome to the building.,2,Big Bang Theory,25,4
8700,Leonard,19, Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to help.,2,Big Bang Theory,57,11
8701,Penny,19," Oh, hey, guys.",2,Big Bang Theory,15,3
8702,Leonard,19," Hey, Penny. this is Alicia, our new neighbour.",2,Big Bang Theory,47,8
8703,Penny,19, Hi.,2,Big Bang Theory,4,1
8705,Leonard,19, I'm helping.,2,Big Bang Theory,13,2
8706,Penny,19, I can see.,2,Big Bang Theory,11,3
8707,Sheldon,19," Alicia's non-musical, childless and pro-rug. She's still on probation, of course, but I like her.",2,Big Bang Theory,98,15
8709,Penny,19," Oh, yeah, I don't usually dress like this. I'm going jogging.",2,Big Bang Theory,62,11
8710,Sheldon,19, You don't jog.,2,Big Bang Theory,15,3
8711,Penny,19, I can start.,2,Big Bang Theory,13,3
8712,Sheldon,19," True, but the more likely explanation for your attire is that you're out of clean clothes again.",2,Big Bang Theory,97,17
8713,Penny,19," Thank you, Sheldon.",2,Big Bang Theory,20,3
8714,Sheldon,19," You're welcome, Penny.",2,Big Bang Theory,23,3
8716,Leonard,19, I think you look fantastic.,2,Big Bang Theory,28,5
8718,Penny,19," Oh, yeah, be careful.",2,Big Bang Theory,22,4
8720,Penny,19, Okay.,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
8722,Penny,19," See ya. I'm dressed like a slob today, too.",2,Big Bang Theory,44,9
8723,Sheldon,19," Oh, mimicry. I enjoy mimicry. I've been working on Admiral Ackbar from Return of the Jedi. â€œIt's a trap.â€ù You have to imagine me with a giant squid head. â€œIt's a trap. It's a trap. It's a trap.â€ù",2,Big Bang Theory,203,38
8725,Sheldon,19, Come.,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
8726,Penny,19, Hey.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
8727,Sheldon,19," Congratulations, I see you did your laundry.",2,Big Bang Theory,45,7
8728,Penny,19," Well, sort of.",2,Big Bang Theory,15,3
8729,Sheldon,19, How does one sort of,2,Big Bang Theory,21,5
8730,Penny,19," I bought new clothes, okay? Is Leonard around?",2,Big Bang Theory,47,8
8731,Sheldon,19, He's upstairs at Alicia's.,2,Big Bang Theory,27,4
8732,Penny,19," Oh. all right, that's cool, no biggie. He said he'd help me set up my printer, but I guess I can wait. What exactly is he doing up there?",2,Big Bang Theory,138,29
8733,Sheldon,19," In what I can only perceive as a tactical move to destroy me, he is with Wolowitz and Koothrappali setting up her stereo.",2,Big Bang Theory,122,23
8734,Penny,19," Oh, they're all up there, huh? Hmm, typical.",2,Big Bang Theory,45,8
8735,Sheldon,19," It's axiomatically atypical. Up until recently, they did not know Alicia, and had no encounters with her in a previous location. They never went upstairs to visit the former tenants, so your characterization of their behaviour as typical Is demonstrably fallacious.",2,Big Bang Theory,266,41
8736,Penny,19," Okay, now I see the giant squid head. ",2,Big Bang Theory,39,8
8737,Sheldon,19," Oh, great! now, I have to start all over again. ",2,Big Bang Theory,49,10
8739,Howard,19," Yeah, I thought about renting this apartment, but I'm really more of a downtown loft kind of guy.",2,Big Bang Theory,98,18
8741,Howard,19," Oh, actually I'm, uh, living with a woman in Altadena. Purely platonic, she's also my maid.",2,Big Bang Theory,92,16
8743,Howard,19," I won't lie, it's pretty dope.",2,Big Bang Theory,31,6
8744,Penny,19, Hello?,2,Big Bang Theory,7,1
8746,Penny,19," Hey, I just wanted to bring you a little housewarming gift.",2,Big Bang Theory,60,11
8748,Penny,19, Great.,2,Big Bang Theory,7,1
8750,Penny,19," Oh, this? I'm dressed like a slob today.",2,Big Bang Theory,41,8
8752,Howard,19," Oh, pish-posh.  I don't know, it means shucks.  Shucks means shucks. Let one go once in a while.",2,Big Bang Theory,97,18
8753,Leonard,19," Hey, uh, penny, you want to hear something awesome?",2,Big Bang Theory,52,9
8754,Penny,19, Yeah.,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
8755,Leonard,19," Alicia is an actress, just like you.",2,Big Bang Theory,37,7
8756,Penny,19, That is so awesome.,2,Big Bang Theory,20,4
8758,Penny,19," Yeah, I know, tell me about it.",2,Big Bang Theory,32,7
8760,Penny,19," That's why I work at the Cheesecake Factory, I'm holding out for the right part.",2,Big Bang Theory,81,15
8761,Leonard,19," Alicia, what do you want as your default setting for DVDs, 5.1 Dolby or DTS?",2,Big Bang Theory,77,15
8763,Leonard,19," Well, DTS has more low end, so okay.",2,Big Bang Theory,37,8
8764,Penny,19," Uh, hey, guys, guys, you will really appreciate this, I read the best science joke on the internet. Alicia, you won't get it, but it's right up their alley. Anyway, so, this physicist goes into an ice cream parlour every week and orders an ice cream sundae for himself, and then offers one to the empty stool sitting next to him. This goes on for a while until the owner finally asks him what he's doing. The man says, â€œwell, I'm a physicist, and quantum mechanics teaches us that it is possible for the matter above this stool to spontaneously turn into a beautiful woman who might accept my offer and fall in love with me.â€ù The owner then says, â€œwell, lots of single, beautiful women come in here every day, why don't you buy an ice cream for one of them, and they might fall in love with you?â€ù And the physicist says, â€œyeah, but what are the odds of that happening?â€ù",2,Big Bang Theory,882,163
8765,Leonard,19," It's a little insulting, don't you think?",2,Big Bang Theory,42,7
8766,Penny,19, How would I know? I'm not even sure I get it.,2,Big Bang Theory,46,11
8768,Leonard,19," Uh, yeah, I'd love to.",2,Big Bang Theory,23,5
8769,Penny,19," Uh, hey, maybe when you're done with her printer, you could set up mine. You know, like you promised a week ago.",2,Big Bang Theory,113,22
8770,Leonard,19," Yeah, I'll get to it, don't nag me.",2,Big Bang Theory,36,8
8771,Raj,19, Hello there,2,Big Bang Theory,12,2
8773,Sheldon,19," Who is it? Oh hello, Penny, it's open, come in. Sarcasm.",2,Big Bang Theory,57,11
8774,Penny,19," Well, they're all still up there.",2,Big Bang Theory,34,6
8775,Sheldon,19," You think I can't hear them? Listen to that. Stomp, stomp, stomp. That's Wolowitz in his stacked heels that fool no one.",2,Big Bang Theory,121,22
8776,Penny,19," I don't even know why I care. I don't care. All right, I cared enough to memorize that stupid joke, but that's all I care.",2,Big Bang Theory,123,25
8777,Sheldon,19," You know, Penny, there's something that occurs in beehives you might find interesting. Occasionally, a new queen will arrive while the old queen is still in power. When this happens, the old queen must either locate to a new hive or engage in a battle to the death until only one queen remains.",2,Big Bang Theory,295,53
8778,Penny,19," What are you saying, that I'm threatened by Alicia? That I'm like the old queen of the hive and it's just time for me to go?",2,Big Bang Theory,125,26
8779,Sheldon,19, I'm just talking about bees. They're on the discovery channel. What are you talking about?,2,Big Bang Theory,91,15
8780,Penny,19, Bees. Aaah! I just got that physicist joke.,2,Big Bang Theory,44,8
8782,Leonard,19," Gee, Penny, thanks for buying us dinner.",2,Big Bang Theory,41,7
8783,Howard,19," Yeah, what's the occasion?",2,Big Bang Theory,27,4
8784,Penny,19," No, no occasion, just felt like getting some Chinese chow for my peeps.",2,Big Bang Theory,72,13
8785,Sheldon,19," Did you remember to ask for the chicken with broccoli to be diced, not shredded?",2,Big Bang Theory,81,15
8786,Penny,19, Yes.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
8787,Sheldon,19, Even though the menu description specifies shredded?,2,Big Bang Theory,53,7
8788,Penny,19, Yes.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
8789,Sheldon,19," Brown rice, not white?",2,Big Bang Theory,23,4
8790,Penny,19, Yes.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
8791,Sheldon,19, You stop at the Korean grocery and get the good hot mustard?,2,Big Bang Theory,61,12
8792,Penny,19, Yes.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
8793,Sheldon,19, Did you pick up the low-sodium soy sauce from the market?,2,Big Bang Theory,58,11
8794,Penny,19, Yes,2,Big Bang Theory,4,1
8795,Sheldon,19," Good. See how it's done, Leonard?",2,Big Bang Theory,34,6
8796,Penny,19," So, what do we got going on tonight, huh? Playing Halo watching Battlestar, drop some mentos in diet coke?",2,Big Bang Theory,107,19
8797,Leonard,19, You want to watch Battlestar?,2,Big Bang Theory,30,5
8798,Penny,19," What can I say? I got my geek on, boys.",2,Big Bang Theory,40,10
8799,Howard,19," No, no, PMS is different. ",2,Big Bang Theory,27,5
8801,Leonard,19, What's wrong?,2,Big Bang Theory,14,2
8803,Leonard,19," Oh, I'd watch that.",2,Big Bang Theory,20,4
8805,Leonard,19," Okay, well, I'll take you.",2,Big Bang Theory,27,5
8807,Howard,19, I'll run lines with you in the car.,2,Big Bang Theory,36,8
8809,Penny,19," Oh, actually, that's okay. we already have",2,Big Bang Theory,43,7
8810,Howard,19, Yum. Starving.,2,Big Bang Theory,15,2
8811,Penny,19, chinese food right here.,2,Big Bang Theory,25,4
8812,Sheldon,19," They're gone, Penny. They can't hear you.",2,Big Bang Theory,42,7
8813,Penny,19," I cannot believe they're letting her just use them like that. I mean, anything she wants, they go panting after her like trained dogs. You know that just last week, she had Howard drive all the way to her uncle's house in Orange County to pick up her TV?",2,Big Bang Theory,255,49
8814,Sheldon,19, You once had Leonard and me get your television from your ex-boyfriend.,2,Big Bang Theory,72,12
8815,Penny,19," Apples and oranges here, Sheldon. I'm telling you, that girl is a user, iceskating through the life on her looks, taking advantage of innocent weak-willed men, getting auditions for stupid network shows. It creams my corn.",2,Big Bang Theory,223,36
8816,Sheldon,19, May I interject something here?,2,Big Bang Theory,32,5
8817,Penny,19, Please.,2,Big Bang Theory,8,1
8818,Sheldon,19, You got the wrong mustard.,2,Big Bang Theory,27,5
8823,Penny,19, Oh boy.,2,Big Bang Theory,8,2
8825,Penny,19," Uh, no. No, no, no, you know, congratulations, I think you'll make a great hooker.",2,Big Bang Theory,83,15
8827,Penny,19," Um, I don't know, I don't think a lot.",2,Big Bang Theory,39,9
8829,Penny,19," Um, hey, hey, can I talk to you about that for a second?",2,Big Bang Theory,57,13
8831,Penny,19," Well, you know, it's just that Leonard and Howard and Raj, they aren't like other guys. They're special.",2,Big Bang Theory,105,18
8833,Penny,19," Oh, let's see, how can I explain this, um, they don't know how to use their shields.",2,Big Bang Theory,85,17
8835,Penny,19," Yeah, you know, like in Star Trek, when you're in battle and you raise the shields? Where the hell did that come from? Anyways, um, you know how guys like this are, so, please don't take advantage of them.",2,Big Bang Theory,206,39
8837,Penny,19," Come on, they're doing everything for you, because you're leading them on.",2,Big Bang Theory,75,12
8839,Penny,19, Excuse me?,2,Big Bang Theory,11,2
8841,Penny,19," Okay, lady, you are way out of line.",2,Big Bang Theory,37,8
8843,Penny,19," Yeah, you're out of line.",2,Big Bang Theory,26,5
8846,Raj,19," I like green lantern, I'm just saying it's pretty lame that He can be defeated by the colour yellow.",2,Big Bang Theory,101,19
8847,Sheldon,19, Only the modern green lantern is vulnerable to yellow.,2,Big Bang Theory,55,9
8848,Leonard,19, Golden age green lantern was vulnerable to wood.,2,Big Bang Theory,49,8
8849,Raj,19," Great, so I can take them both out with a number-two pencil?",2,Big Bang Theory,61,12
8850,Howard,19," Oh, my God! Girl fight! ",2,Big Bang Theory,25,5
8851,Leonard,19, What are you doing?,2,Big Bang Theory,20,4
8852,Howard,19, I know you. you're stupid enough to break it up.,2,Big Bang Theory,49,10
8854,Howard,19, May I say you look very comely tonight?,2,Big Bang Theory,40,8
8855,Penny,19, Thank you.,2,Big Bang Theory,11,2
8856,Howard,19," You're right, this filly's been broken.",2,Big Bang Theory,40,6
8857,Sheldon,19," You set it on DTS, didn't you?",2,Big Bang Theory,31,7
8858,Leonard,19," I had to, she called me cutie.",2,Big Bang Theory,31,7
8859,Howard,19," According to Alicia's facebook page, she's hooking up with one of the producers on CSI.",2,Big Bang Theory,88,15
8860,Penny,19," Well, dead whore on TV, live one in real life.",2,Big Bang Theory,47,10
8861,Sheldon,19," Oh, great now she's jumping up and down on the bed.",2,Big Bang Theory,52,11
8863,Sheldon,20, Hu-u-u-uh. Hu-u-u-uh!,2,Big Bang Theory,22,2
8864,Leonard,20, Problem?,2,Big Bang Theory,9,1
8865,Sheldon,20, This is Thai food.,2,Big Bang Theory,19,4
8866,Howard,20, Here we go.,2,Big Bang Theory,12,3
8867,Sheldon,20, We don't have Thai food on Thursday. We have pizza on Thursday.,2,Big Bang Theory,64,12
8868,Leonard,20," Yes, but we all agreed that the third Thursday of every month would be Anything Can Happen Thursday.",2,Big Bang Theory,101,18
8869,Sheldon,20," Well apparently the news didn't reach my digestive system, which, when startled, has its own version of Anything Can Happen Thursday.",2,Big Bang Theory,134,21
8870,Howard,20," Come on, the whole idea behind Anything Can Happen Thursday is to get out of this rut we've been in lately.",2,Big Bang Theory,108,21
8871,Sheldon,20," Rut? I think you mean consistency. And if we're going to abandon that, then why even call it Thursday? Let's call it Quonko Day and divide it into 29 hours of 17 minutes apiece, and celebrate it by sacrificing a goat to the mighty god Ra.",2,Big Bang Theory,239,46
8872,Raj,20, I could go for some goat.,2,Big Bang Theory,26,6
8873,Leonard,20," Sheldon, we agreed we'd do something different tonight.",2,Big Bang Theory,56,8
8874,Sheldon,20, All right. Let's go to the comic book store.,2,Big Bang Theory,45,9
8875,Raj,20, We went to the comic book store last night.,2,Big Bang Theory,44,9
8876,Sheldon,20," Last night was Wednesday. Wednesday is comic book night. Tonight, we'll be going on Thursday, because it's Anything Can Happen Thursday.",2,Big Bang Theory,137,21
8877,Leonard,20," Way to think outside but pressed right up against the box, Sheldon.",2,Big Bang Theory,68,12
8878,Raj,20, So what are we going to do tonight?,2,Big Bang Theory,36,8
8879,Howard,20," If I may proffer a suggestion, in bars all across this great nation of ours, Thursday night is Ladies' Night. Which means, as the evening progresses, we will get better looking courtesy of 99 cent margaritas and two-for-one Jell-O shots.",2,Big Bang Theory,238,40
8880,Leonard,20," Come on, Howard, the odds of us picking up girls in a bar are practically zero.",2,Big Bang Theory,80,16
8881,Howard,20, Really? Are you familiar with the Drake Equation?,2,Big Bang Theory,50,8
8882,Sheldon,20," The one that estimates the odds of making contact with extraterrestrials by calculating the product of an increasingly restrictive series of fractional values such as those stars with planets, and those planets likely to develop life? N equals R times FP times NE times FL times FI times FC times L?",2,Big Bang Theory,300,51
8883,Howard,20," Yeah, that one. You can modify it to calculate our chances of having sex by changing the formula to use the number of single women in Los Angeles, the number of those who might find us attractive, and what I call the Wolowitz Coefficient.",2,Big Bang Theory,239,44
8884,Raj,20, The Wolowitz Coefficient?,2,Big Bang Theory,26,3
8885,Howard,20," Neediness times dress size squared. Crunching the numbers, I come up with a conservative 5,812 potential sex partners within a 40-mile radius.",2,Big Bang Theory,143,22
8886,Leonard,20, You're joking.,2,Big Bang Theory,15,2
8887,Howard,20," I'm a horny engineer, Leonard. I never joke about math or sex.",2,Big Bang Theory,63,12
8888,Raj,20," Well, what are we waiting for? Let's bounce, bitches.",2,Big Bang Theory,54,9
8889,Leonard,20," You're right. It's Anything Can Happen Thursday, let's hit the clubs and meet hot women!",2,Big Bang Theory,89,15
8890,Raj,20, Here we go. Lock up your daughters! We're going to hit it and quit it.,2,Big Bang Theory,71,15
8891,Leonard,20, Or we could finish eating and go to the comic book store.,2,Big Bang Theory,58,12
8892,Raj,20, Also a good plan.,2,Big Bang Theory,18,4
8893,Howard,20," Alright, but next Anything Can Happen Thursday, we're definitely going to a bar.",2,Big Bang Theory,81,13
8894,Leonard,20," Oh, absolutely.",2,Big Bang Theory,16,2
8895,Raj,20," You heard that, Ladies' Night ladies? We're eventually coming for you!",2,Big Bang Theory,71,11
8896,Sheldon,20, Fascinating.,2,Big Bang Theory,13,1
8897,Penny,20," Oh hey, guys, where're you headed?",2,Big Bang Theory,35,6
8898,Sheldon,20," To the comic book store. You're probably thinking, the comic book store? On a Thursday? Why, I've fallen down the rabbit hole and into a land of madness. What you have failed to take into account, Penny, is that this is Anything Can Happen Thursday.",2,Big Bang Theory,250,45
8899,Penny,20," You got me. While you're there, could pick me up a few comics for my nephew's birthday?",2,Big Bang Theory,88,17
8900,Sheldon,20, I think you mean comic books. Comics are feeble attempts at humour featuring talking babies and anthropomorphized pets found traditionally in the optimistically named funny pages.,2,Big Bang Theory,180,26
8901,Penny,20," Leonard, could you pick me up a few comics for my nephew's birthday?",2,Big Bang Theory,69,13
8902,Leonard,20, Sure. What does he like?,2,Big Bang Theory,25,5
8903,Penny,20," I don't know, he's 13. Just pick out anything.",2,Big Bang Theory,47,9
8904,Sheldon,20," Just pick out anything? Maybe at the same time we can pick out a new suit for him without knowing his size, or pick out his career for him without knowing his aptitude, or pick out a new breakfast cereal without knowing his fibre requirements or his feelings about little marshmallows.",2,Big Bang Theory,286,51
8905,Penny,20, Spider-Man. Get him Spider-Man.,2,Big Bang Theory,32,4
8906,Sheldon,20," Amazing Spider-Man, Ultimate Spider-Man, Spectacular Spider-Man, The Marvelous Adventures of Spider-Man, Spider-Man 2099?",2,Big Bang Theory,122,13
8907,Penny,20, Leonard?,2,Big Bang Theory,9,1
8908,Leonard,20," You know this can go on all night, why don't you just come with us?",2,Big Bang Theory,68,15
8909,Penny,20," Ugh, that's what I was trying to avoid.",2,Big Bang Theory,40,8
8910,Sheldon,20," Oh, I forgot Sensational Spider-Man.",2,Big Bang Theory,37,5
8912,Penny,20," Oh, what a cute, little store. Everybody's staring at me.",2,Big Bang Theory,58,10
8913,Leonard,20," Don't worry, they're more scared of you than you are of them.",2,Big Bang Theory,62,12
8914,Penny,20," Unlikely. Here, what about this one for my nephew?",2,Big Bang Theory,51,9
8915,Sheldon,20, A superb choice.,2,Big Bang Theory,17,3
8916,Penny,20," Oh, great.",2,Big Bang Theory,11,2
8917,Sheldon,20," Yeah, provided he has already read Infinite Crisis and 52, and is familiar with the re-establishment of the DC multiverse.",2,Big Bang Theory,123,20
8918,Penny,20, What's a multiverse?,2,Big Bang Theory,21,3
8919,Sheldon,20, Get her out of here.,2,Big Bang Theory,21,5
8920,Leonard,20," Come on, I'll help you pick something.",2,Big Bang Theory,39,7
8921,Raj,20, That's right. She's with us. Guys like that are so pathetic.,2,Big Bang Theory,61,11
8922,Howard,20," Tell me about it. Look, a new Batman belt buckle.",2,Big Bang Theory,50,10
8924,Leonard,20," Oh, hey, Stuart. This is Penny. She's looking for some comic books.",2,Big Bang Theory,68,12
8926,Leonard,20," I think we're fine, Stuart.",2,Big Bang Theory,28,5
8928,Penny,20, Thanks. He seems like a nice guy.,2,Big Bang Theory,34,7
8929,Leonard,20, You mean for someone who's into comic books?,2,Big Bang Theory,45,8
8930,Penny,20," No, no, no, I just meant for yeah.",2,Big Bang Theory,35,8
8931,Leonard,20," Penny, just because people appreciate comic books doesn't make them weirdos. Stuart's a terrific artist. He went to the Rhode Island School of Design.",2,Big Bang Theory,151,24
8932,Penny,20, What about the guy over there in the superhero T-shirt tucked into his sweatpants?,2,Big Bang Theory,83,14
8933,Leonard,20," Ah, yeah, that's Captain Sweatpants. He doesn't really help the point I'm trying to make.",2,Big Bang Theory,90,15
8934,Howard,20," Let it go, Sheldon.",2,Big Bang Theory,20,4
8935,Sheldon,20, Why should I let it go? I saw it first.,2,Big Bang Theory,40,10
8936,Howard,20," Yes, but I saw it from the front.",2,Big Bang Theory,34,8
8937,Sheldon,20, A far less impressive feat.,2,Big Bang Theory,28,5
8938,Howard,20," Oh, come on! I need this for my Batman collection.",2,Big Bang Theory,51,10
8939,Sheldon,20, I need it for my Robin collection.,2,Big Bang Theory,35,7
8940,Howard,20, Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock?,2,Big Bang Theory,34,1
8941,Sheldon,20, Why would I gamble? It's mine. Let go.,2,Big Bang Theory,39,8
8942,Howard,20, You let go.,2,Big Bang Theory,12,3
8943,Sheldon,20," No, you!",2,Big Bang Theory,9,2
8944,Leonard,20, Problem?,2,Big Bang Theory,9,1
8945,Sheldon,20," Yes, he won't let go of my comic book.",2,Big Bang Theory,39,9
8946,Howard,20, It's my comic book!,2,Big Bang Theory,20,4
8947,Sheldon,20," Leonard, we need a ruling.",2,Big Bang Theory,27,5
8948,Leonard,20," Uh, cut it in half?",2,Big Bang Theory,20,5
8949,Penny,20, Excuse me.,2,Big Bang Theory,11,2
8951,Penny,20, Hi. What would you recommend as a present for a 13-year-old boy?,2,Big Bang Theory,65,12
8953,Penny,20," Oh, Hellblazer. What's this about?",2,Big Bang Theory,35,5
8955,Penny,20," Well, if that doesn't make me the favourite aunt, I don't know what will. Is this me?",2,Big Bang Theory,86,17
8957,Penny,20, It's really good.,2,Big Bang Theory,18,3
8959,Penny,20," That's so sweet, but what if I didn't like it?",2,Big Bang Theory,47,10
8961,Leonard,20, I don't believe it. Stuart's putting the moves on Penny.,2,Big Bang Theory,57,10
8962,Howard,20, I have got to learn how to draw. Hey!,2,Big Bang Theory,38,9
8963,Sheldon,20," Once again, defeated by your own prurient interests.",2,Big Bang Theory,53,8
8964,Raj,20," Guys, have you seen Stuart all up in Penny's business over there?",2,Big Bang Theory,66,12
8965,Leonard,20," Nobody's up in anybody's business, let's just buy our stuff and go.",2,Big Bang Theory,68,12
8966,Penny,20," Okay, you've got my number, now, give me the picture.",2,Big Bang Theory,54,10
8968,Penny,20," All right. So, um, just give me a call.",2,Big Bang Theory,40,9
8969,Sheldon,20," So, Leonard, how are you enjoying Anything Can Happen Thursday?",2,Big Bang Theory,64,10
8971,Sheldon,20," Look at that, that's a dent. Thank you, Howard Ham-Fisted Wolowitz. Did you just shut the TV off in the middle of the classic Deep Space Nine/Star Trek The Original Series Trouble With Tribbles crossover episode?",2,Big Bang Theory,213,36
8972,Leonard,20, Apparently so.,2,Big Bang Theory,15,2
8973,Sheldon,20, Are you ill?,2,Big Bang Theory,13,3
8974,Leonard,20, No.,2,Big Bang Theory,4,1
8975,Sheldon,20, All right. Then is it fair to say that you're experiencing some sort of emotional turmoil over the events involving Penny earlier this evening?,2,Big Bang Theory,144,24
8976,Leonard,20, When did you pick up on that?,2,Big Bang Theory,30,7
8977,Sheldon,20," A moment ago, when you turned off the TV in the middle of }during the classic Deep Space Nine/Star Trek The Original Series Trouble With Tribbles crossover episode. Would you like some advice?",2,Big Bang Theory,193,33
8978,Leonard,20," Sure, why not?",2,Big Bang Theory,15,3
8979,Sheldon,20," Then, this is the perfect time to launch a blog with an interactive comments section.",2,Big Bang Theory,86,15
8980,Leonard,20," Gee, thanks a lot.",2,Big Bang Theory,19,4
8981,Sheldon,20, Would you rather I offer my personal insight?,2,Big Bang Theory,46,8
8982,Leonard,20, I don't need any insights. I just want to know why Penny's more interested in Stuart than me. We're practically the same guy.,2,Big Bang Theory,126,23
8983,Sheldon,20," Oh, I disagree. Stuart is taller, artistic, self-employed and, most significantly, he gets 45 percent off comic books.",2,Big Bang Theory,119,18
8984,Leonard,20," You're right, I really should be asking strangers on the Internet.",2,Big Bang Theory,67,11
8985,Sheldon,20, My original point.,2,Big Bang Theory,19,3
8987,Sheldon,20," Chinese food, vintage video games. After the nightmare of Anything Can Happen Thursday, this is Friday night the way it was meant to be.",2,Big Bang Theory,137,24
8988,Howard,20, Who's up for Sheldon-Free Saturday?,2,Big Bang Theory,36,5
8989,Penny,20," Oh, hey guys.",2,Big Bang Theory,14,3
8990,Leonard,20," Hey, Penny and Stuart, hey Stuart.",2,Big Bang Theory,35,6
8992,Howard,20, So what are you kids up to?,2,Big Bang Theory,28,7
8993,Penny,20," Uh, Stuart has a piece in an art show that's opening tonight.",2,Big Bang Theory,62,12
8994,Leonard,20," And you guys are going together, great",2,Big Bang Theory,39,7
8996,Penny,20," It's Friday night, that means Chinese food and vintage video games, right?",2,Big Bang Theory,75,12
8997,Sheldon,20," Vintage doesn't even begin to describe what we have planned. Tonight, we are playing the classic 1980 interactive text adventure, Zork. It's the buggy beta version.",2,Big Bang Theory,165,26
8998,Penny,20," Wow, Zork. Well, you guys have fun.",2,Big Bang Theory,36,7
9000,Howard,20," See you, Stuart.",2,Big Bang Theory,17,3
9001,Leonard,20," Hey, Howard?",2,Big Bang Theory,13,2
9002,Howard,20, Yes.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
9003,Leonard,20, Take me to a bar with women.,2,Big Bang Theory,29,7
9004,Howard,20, Really?,2,Big Bang Theory,8,1
9005,Leonard,20, Yeah.,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
9006,Howard,20, Okay! Let me just go inside and slip off my underwear.,2,Big Bang Theory,55,11
9007,Leonard,20, Why?,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
9008,Howard,20," Well, if I get lucky, I don't want to be caught in my Aquaman briefs.",2,Big Bang Theory,70,15
9009,Leonard,20, Do you?  Let's go.,2,Big Bang Theory,19,4
9011,Raj,20," May I have a grasshopper with a little umbrella, please?",2,Big Bang Theory,57,10
9012,Howard,20," No, he may not.",2,Big Bang Theory,16,4
9013,Raj,20, Why?,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
9014,Howard,20, I'm not sitting here with a guy drinking a grasshopper with a little umbrella.,2,Big Bang Theory,79,14
9015,Raj,20, Fine. I'll have a chocolate martini.,2,Big Bang Theory,37,6
9016,Howard,20, Wrong again!,2,Big Bang Theory,13,2
9017,Raj,20," Come on, you know I can't talk to women unless I'm lit up like the Hindu festival of Diwali.",2,Big Bang Theory,93,19
9018,Howard,20," Look, there are plenty of bars in Los Angeles where you can order grasshoppers and chocolate martinis, but you wouldn't have to because there are no women in them.",2,Big Bang Theory,164,29
9019,Raj,20, Gotcha. I'll have a Brandy Alexander.,2,Big Bang Theory,38,6
9020,Howard,20," All right, the Three Musketeers just became the Dynamic Duo.",2,Big Bang Theory,61,10
9021,Leonard,20, Should we talk to some of these women?,2,Big Bang Theory,39,8
9022,Howard,20," It's way too early in the night for that. See, first we let the lawyers and the jocks thin the herd, and then we go after the weak and the old and the lame.",2,Big Bang Theory,157,34
9023,Leonard,20, That's your system?,2,Big Bang Theory,20,3
9024,Howard,20," That's my system. Oh, and if you spot a chick with a Seeing Eye dog, she's mine.",2,Big Bang Theory,81,17
9026,Penny,20, Oh come on. I think it's nice that Captain Sweatpants showed up to your art opening.,2,Big Bang Theory,85,16
9028,Penny,20," Um, you know, it's kind of early. Do you want to maybe come in for some coffee or something?",2,Big Bang Theory,93,19
9030,Penny,20," Oh, you think coffee, means coffee, that is so sweet. Come on, I think I have decaf.",2,Big Bang Theory,85,17
9031,Sheldon,20," Oh, good, Stuart, I thought I heard your voice. Do you have a moment?",2,Big Bang Theory,70,14
9033,Penny,20," Sheldon, we're a little busy here, so",2,Big Bang Theory,38,7
9034,Sheldon,20, What are you doing?,2,Big Bang Theory,20,4
9036,Sheldon,20, Isn't it a little late for coffee?,2,Big Bang Theory,35,7
9038,Penny,20, I'll just go look for it.,2,Big Bang Theory,26,6
9040,Sheldon,20," Well, I've spent the last three hours in an online debate in the DC Comics Batman chatroom, and I need your help.",2,Big Bang Theory,114,22
9042,Sheldon,20," I am asserting, in the event that Batman's death proves permanent, that original Robin, Dick Grayson, is the logical successor to the Bat Cowl.",2,Big Bang Theory,144,24
9044,Sheldon,20, More wrong? Wrong is an absolute state and not subject to gradation.,2,Big Bang Theory,69,12
9046,Sheldon,20, Has to be? Has to be? I hope you're being deliberately provocative.,2,Big Bang Theory,68,12
9047,Penny,20, I found the decaf!,2,Big Bang Theory,19,4
9049,Sheldon,20," Yeah, herbal tea for me, please.",2,Big Bang Theory,33,6
9051,Raj,20, Barkeep! Alexander me.,2,Big Bang Theory,23,3
9052,Leonard,20, How about those two?,2,Big Bang Theory,21,4
9053,Howard,20," Nah, they're eating peanuts, and my allergies, one kiss would put me in Cedar-Sinai for a week.",2,Big Bang Theory,96,17
9054,Leonard,20, What about the ones in the corner?,2,Big Bang Theory,35,7
9055,Howard,20," Possible, very possible. Do you want the one in the whiplash collar or the one who keeps blinking?",2,Big Bang Theory,99,18
9056,Leonard,20, I think Blinky's cute.,2,Big Bang Theory,23,4
9057,Howard,20," You got it, sir.",2,Big Bang Theory,17,4
9058,Leonard,20," Wait, so we just go over there?",2,Big Bang Theory,32,7
9059,Howard,20," No, we have a little prep work to do. Put this in your mouth. We walk past them, you stumble a bit. I say, sorry, my friend's had a little too much, and then I start to pull it out of your mouth and say, a little too much fun. Get it? I mean, they're laughing, we're laughing, and then we get them up to about a .15 blood alcohol level, and tell them we're millionaires.",2,Big Bang Theory,371,76
9060,Leonard,20, What else you got?,2,Big Bang Theory,19,4
9061,Howard,20, Depends. Are you willing to sit on my lap and pretend to be a ventriloquist dummy?,2,Big Bang Theory,83,16
9062,Leonard,20, No.,2,Big Bang Theory,4,1
9063,Howard,20," I can't sit on your lap, you don't know the routine.",2,Big Bang Theory,53,11
9066,Sheldon,20, Of course I am. Removing Joe Chill as the killer of Batman's parents effectively deprived him of his raison d'Ãªtre.,2,Big Bang Theory,117,20
9068,Sheldon,20, Au contraire.,2,Big Bang Theory,14,2
9070,Sheldon,20, I am forgetting nothing and I resent your tone.,2,Big Bang Theory,48,9
9072,Sheldon,20," So, I win.",2,Big Bang Theory,11,3
9074,Sheldon,20," So, I win.",2,Big Bang Theory,11,3
9076,Sheldon,20," Darn tootin', I win.",2,Big Bang Theory,21,4
9078,Sheldon,20," No, no, no, no, don't wake her. She'll maul you like a rabid wolverine.",2,Big Bang Theory,72,14
9081,Howard,20," Wait, is this your card or isn't it? Trust me, this was their card.",2,Big Bang Theory,68,14
9082,Leonard,20, I thought you were good at this. You're always talking about how you go to bars and meet women.,2,Big Bang Theory,96,19
9083,Howard,20," I do, all the time.",2,Big Bang Theory,20,5
9084,Leonard,20," Well, what happened? We've been sitting here all night and the longest conversation you've had with a woman was when your mom called.",2,Big Bang Theory,134,23
9085,Howard,20," Wow, you're just going to make me come out and say it, aren't you?",2,Big Bang Theory,67,14
9086,Leonard,20, Say what?,2,Big Bang Theory,10,2
9087,Howard,20, You're weighing me down. I'm a falcon who hunts better solo.,2,Big Bang Theory,61,11
9088,Leonard,20, Fine. I'll sit here. You take flight and hunt.,2,Big Bang Theory,47,9
9089,Howard,20," Don't be ridiculous, you can't just tell a falcon when to hunt.",2,Big Bang Theory,64,12
9090,Leonard,20," Actually, you can. There's a whole sport built around it. Falconry.",2,Big Bang Theory,68,11
9091,Howard,20," Shut up. Let's just get Koothrappali and go.  Lucky bastard. It's got to be that stupid accent of his.  Hello. I am Sanjay Wolowitz from Bombay. Okay, I'm stumped.",2,Big Bang Theory,164,29
9094,Howard,21," Okay, are you from Star Wars universe?",2,Big Bang Theory,39,7
9095,Leonard,21, Yes,2,Big Bang Theory,4,1
9096,Howard,21, Were you in the original trilogy?,2,Big Bang Theory,34,6
9097,Leonard,21, Yes,2,Big Bang Theory,4,1
9098,Howard,21, Is there a picture of you in my wallet wearing a metal bikini?,2,Big Bang Theory,63,13
9099,Leonard,21," God, I hope not. And no, I'm not Princess Leia.",2,Big Bang Theory,48,10
9100,Raj,21," Oh, okay, okay, my turn. Are you in the six Star Wars movies?",2,Big Bang Theory,62,13
9101,Leonard,21, Yes,2,Big Bang Theory,4,1
9102,Raj,21, Interesting. Are you a Droid?,2,Big Bang Theory,30,5
9103,Leonard,21, Yes,2,Big Bang Theory,4,1
9104,Raj,21, Do you kind of look like a shiny Sheldon?,2,Big Bang Theory,42,9
9105,Leonard,21, Yes,2,Big Bang Theory,4,1
9106,Raj,21, C3PO.,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
9107,Leonard,21, You got it.,2,Big Bang Theory,12,3
9108,Sheldon,21," That's preposterous. I do not resemble C3PO. Don't get me wrong, I'm flattered, I just don't see it.",2,Big Bang Theory,101,18
9109,Howard,21," Leslie Winkle. You've reached friends with benefits. For a booty call, press one now.",2,Big Bang Theory,86,14
9110,Sheldon,21," What exactly does that expression mean, friends with benefits? Does he provide her with health insurance?",2,Big Bang Theory,106,16
9111,Leonard,21," No. Look, imagine you maintained a friendship with someone you had sex with, but you were free to date whoever you wanted.",2,Big Bang Theory,123,22
9112,Sheldon,21," I'm sorry, I can't imagine any of that.",2,Big Bang Theory,40,8
9113,Leonard,21," Alright, back to the game.",2,Big Bang Theory,27,5
9114,Sheldon,21," I believe it's my turn, you may begin your questions whenever you're ready.",2,Big Bang Theory,76,13
9115,Raj,21, Are you Spock?,2,Big Bang Theory,15,3
9116,Sheldon,21, I don't like this game.,2,Big Bang Theory,24,5
9117,Howard,21," So, where were we?",2,Big Bang Theory,19,4
9118,Raj,21, Aren't you leaving for your booty call?,2,Big Bang Theory,40,7
9119,Howard,21," No, it was something else. Why does everything have to be about sex with you? Come on. Who's turn is it?",2,Big Bang Theory,105,21
9120,Leonard,21, We were up to you.,2,Big Bang Theory,19,5
9121,Howard,21," Great, just start.",2,Big Bang Theory,19,3
9122,Leonard,21," Okay, let's see. Are you from a TV series?",2,Big Bang Theory,43,9
9123,Howard,21, She dumped me!,2,Big Bang Theory,15,3
9124,Sheldon,21," I bet he's someone from Babylon 5, we're never going to guess.",2,Big Bang Theory,63,12
9126,Raj,21," What happened with Leslie, why did she dump you?",2,Big Bang Theory,49,9
9127,Howard,21," I don't know. She just said Howard, momma's a rolling stone. And then her call waiting beeped and she was gone.",2,Big Bang Theory,112,21
9128,Sheldon,21, I don't understand. If you were in a non-emotional relationship then why are you having what appears be an emotional response?,2,Big Bang Theory,127,21
9129,Leonard,21," Sheldon, he obviously had feelings for her.",2,Big Bang Theory,44,7
9130,Howard,21," Of course I had feelings for her, I saw her naked for God's sake!",2,Big Bang Theory,66,14
9131,Leonard,21," Okay, uh look, you just need to get your mind off it. Do you want to go to the comic book store? Maybe go see a movie?",2,Big Bang Theory,119,27
9132,Howard,21, I don't want to go anywhere.,2,Big Bang Theory,29,6
9133,Sheldon,21," You know, I'm given to understand that there is an entire city in Nevada designed specifically to help people like Howard forget their problems. Where you can replace them with new problems such as alcoholism, gambling addiction and sexually transmitted diseases.",2,Big Bang Theory,264,41
9134,Raj,21," Is it me, or was that Sheldon's way of saying Vegas baby!",2,Big Bang Theory,58,12
9135,Leonard,21," I've never been there, have you?",2,Big Bang Theory,33,6
9136,Raj,21, Me? No. I just got Vegas baby from Vince Vaughn in Swingers. .,2,Big Bang Theory,63,13
9137,Howard,21," It could be fun. I know my weekend's wide open, now that",2,Big Bang Theory,57,12
9138,Leonard,21," Okay, then let's do this, lets go to Las Vegas.",2,Big Bang Theory,48,10
9139,Howard,21, Now? Right now?,2,Big Bang Theory,16,3
9140,Leonard,21," Why not? People do things right now all the time. Why can't we be right now people too. Go home, pack a bag and we'll be right now people. I have to stop at the drug store to refill a prescription, but after that we'll go right now.",2,Big Bang Theory,233,48
9141,Raj,21," What do you say, Howard?",2,Big Bang Theory,25,5
9142,Howard,21, I say Vegas baby!,2,Big Bang Theory,18,4
9143,Raj,21, What are you going to tell your mother?,2,Big Bang Theory,40,8
9144,Howard,21," Sea World, baby!",2,Big Bang Theory,17,3
9145,Leonard,21," Hey, Sheldon, are you coming?",2,Big Bang Theory,30,5
9146,Sheldon,21, I'd rather have a blowfly lay eggs and hatch larvae in my auditory canal.,2,Big Bang Theory,74,14
9147,Leonard,21," Great, we'll bring you back a tee-shirt.",2,Big Bang Theory,41,7
9149,Sheldon,21," Thank you. Hello, neighbour.",2,Big Bang Theory,29,4
9150,Penny,21," Hello, Sheldon.",2,Big Bang Theory,16,2
9151,Sheldon,21, And how are you doing this fine evening?,2,Big Bang Theory,41,8
9152,Penny,21, Great.,2,Big Bang Theory,7,1
9153,Sheldon,21, Good. I'm glad.,2,Big Bang Theory,16,3
9154,Penny,21, Really? Are you drunk?,2,Big Bang Theory,23,4
9155,Sheldon,21," I'm just in a good mood. While my compatriots are in Las Vegas, I will be enjoying a blissful evening in my personal Fortress of Solitude.",2,Big Bang Theory,139,26
9156,Penny,21," That's Superman's big ice thing, right?",2,Big Bang Theory,40,6
9157,Sheldon,21," Do you know, I'm such a good mood, I'm actually finding your tenuous grasp of the English language folksy and charming today.",2,Big Bang Theory,126,22
9158,Penny,21," Mmm, what smells so good?",2,Big Bang Theory,26,5
9159,Sheldon,21," That is the intoxicating aroma of Kadhai Paneer, a perfect culinary representation of the freedom this evening holds. Not only is it Indian cuisine, which Koothrappali loathes, it contains a generous helping of peanuts, which would reduce Wolowitz to a wheezing 97 pound blister. And finally, it's main ingredient is Paneer, a farmer's cheese which would cause Leonard to render any room uninhabitable within minutes.",2,Big Bang Theory,418,65
9160,Penny,21," Yum. Well, enjoy your big evening.",2,Big Bang Theory,35,6
9161,Sheldon,21," Penny. I realize you are also on your own tonight, so if at some point you find yourself with nothing to do, please do not disturb me.",2,Big Bang Theory,135,27
9162,Penny,21," Have fun, Sheldon.",2,Big Bang Theory,19,3
9163,Sheldon,21," Oh, I shall.  No!",2,Big Bang Theory,18,4
9164,Penny,21," What's wrong, Superman? Locked out of your big ice thingy?",2,Big Bang Theory,59,10
9166,Raj,21," Look at this, mouthwash, lotion, body wash, shampoo and conditioner together in one tiny bottle. I love Las Vegas.",2,Big Bang Theory,115,19
9167,Leonard,21," Howard, could I borrow some after shave?",2,Big Bang Theory,41,7
9168,Howard,21," Black case, top compartment.",2,Big Bang Theory,29,4
9169,Leonard,21, That is a lot of cologne.,2,Big Bang Theory,26,6
9170,Howard,21," First row are your musks, second is wood, leathers and botanicals, third is assorted pheromones, tread lightly.",2,Big Bang Theory,112,17
9171,Raj,21," That's the spirit, Howard. Yes, we can.",2,Big Bang Theory,40,7
9172,Leonard,21," Come on, let's go.",2,Big Bang Theory,19,4
9173,Howard,21," You guys go ahead, I just have to finish up an email.",2,Big Bang Theory,54,12
9174,Leonard,21," That's not an email, that's Leslie's facebook page.",2,Big Bang Theory,52,8
9175,Howard,21," Okay, fine, I'm checking her facebook page, look at her status update, she's saying she dumped me, people need to know I dumped her.",2,Big Bang Theory,133,24
9176,Raj,21, But she did dump you.,2,Big Bang Theory,22,5
9177,Howard,21," Grow up, Raj,there's no place for truth on the internet. Just go, I'll catch up with you.",2,Big Bang Theory,90,17
9178,Leonard,21, Alright.,2,Big Bang Theory,9,1
9179,Raj,21," Oh, we should have a plan in case one of us gets lucky.",2,Big Bang Theory,56,13
9180,Leonard,21," Okay, uh, if I get lucky I'll take her to my stately manor outside Gotham City, and if you get lucky, I'll sleep on the moon.",2,Big Bang Theory,126,26
9181,Raj,21, Sounds like a plan.,2,Big Bang Theory,20,4
9183,Penny,21," Hang on, I think the emergency key is around here somewhere.",2,Big Bang Theory,61,11
9184,Sheldon,21, We have a bowl. Our keys go in a bowl. You should get a bowl.,2,Big Bang Theory,62,15
9185,Penny,21," So, how did the beautiful mind of Sheldon Cooper forget his key in the first place.",2,Big Bang Theory,84,16
9186,Sheldon,21, I left them in the bowl.,2,Big Bang Theory,25,6
9187,Penny,21, Oh-oh. I just remembered where the emergency key is.,2,Big Bang Theory,53,9
9188,Sheldon,21, Where?,2,Big Bang Theory,7,1
9189,Penny,21, In your apartment.,2,Big Bang Theory,19,3
9190,Sheldon,21, What's it doing in my apartment?,2,Big Bang Theory,33,6
9191,Penny,21," Well, I went in there a few weeks ago when you guys weren't home, and I forgot it there.",2,Big Bang Theory,89,19
9192,Sheldon,21, You were in my why would you what are you saying?,2,Big Bang Theory,50,11
9193,Penny,21," It's not a big deal, I was making coffee and I ran out of milk.",2,Big Bang Theory,64,15
9194,Sheldon,21, You're the milk thief! Leonard said I was crazy but I knew that carton felt lighter.,2,Big Bang Theory,85,16
9195,Penny,21," Alright, Sheldon, let's just calm down and we'll call the building manager, he'll come open your door, you just eat your dinner here while you're waiting.",2,Big Bang Theory,155,26
9196,Sheldon,21, Eat? My dinner? In your apartment?,2,Big Bang Theory,35,6
9197,Penny,21," Yeah, why not?",2,Big Bang Theory,15,3
9198,Sheldon,21," Sure, why not? And after the sun's down we can all pile in my pick-up and go skinny-dipping down at the creek. â€˜Cause today's the day to stop making sense.",2,Big Bang Theory,158,30
9200,Leonard,21, Thanks.,2,Big Bang Theory,8,1
9201,Raj,21," I'm telling you, Leonard, video slot machines, free drinks brought to us by a bosomy barmaid and all you can eat shrimp for $3.95. Disneyland can suck it. This is the real happiest place on earth.",2,Big Bang Theory,197,36
9202,Leonard,21," Dude, check it out. That's laundry for a month!",2,Big Bang Theory,48,9
9204,Raj,21, Hello.,2,Big Bang Theory,7,1
9206,Raj,21, Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali.,2,Big Bang Theory,29,3
9208,Raj,21," Hello, Michaela.",2,Big Bang Theory,17,2
9210,Raj,21," Why, yes, I love to party. Party is my middle name. Or it would be, if it weren't Ramayan.",2,Big Bang Theory,91,19
9211,Leonard,21," Uh, Raj, can I, can I talk to you for a moment.",2,Big Bang Theory,48,12
9212,Raj,21," Not now, Leonard, Michaela's inviting me to a party. You better call the moon and you make sure that they have a bed for you.",2,Big Bang Theory,126,25
9213,Leonard,21," Yeah, I really need to talk to you.",2,Big Bang Theory,36,8
9214,Raj,21," Excuse me, I'll be right back. Don't go anywhere. Don't move. Just stay the beautiful unspoiled American flower that you are.  What's wrong with you dude, that woman was all up in my jammy.",2,Big Bang Theory,190,34
9215,Leonard,21," Okay, I hate to break this to you and whatever your jammy is, but, I'm pretty sure she is a prostitute.",2,Big Bang Theory,104,21
9216,Raj,21, What? No. ..,2,Big Bang Theory,13,3
9217,Leonard,21," Okay, let me put it this way, in your entire life, how many gorgeous women have walked straight up to you in a bar and asked if you wanted to party.",2,Big Bang Theory,149,31
9218,Raj,21, Maybe I can save her.,2,Big Bang Theory,22,5
9219,Leonard,21," Maybe, but I'm guessing it will cost you about $500 an hour to try.",2,Big Bang Theory,68,14
9220,Raj,21," It was lovely meeting you, best of luck in your future endeavours.",2,Big Bang Theory,67,12
9222,Raj,21," Oh, I miss her already.",2,Big Bang Theory,24,5
9223,Leonard,21," Oh, Howard's losing it. Check out his latest twitters. â€œI'm at the bottom of a black hole staring into the abyss. My life is meaningless, my future is without hope.â€ù",2,Big Bang Theory,170,30
9224,Raj,21, Why don't we take him to see the Blue Man Group?,2,Big Bang Theory,49,11
9225,Leonard,21, You think that'd help?,2,Big Bang Theory,23,4
9226,Raj,21, USA Today calls them exuberant fun for the whole family.,2,Big Bang Theory,57,10
9227,Leonard,21," I don't know, Howard isn't really the family fun kind of guy.",2,Big Bang Theory,62,12
9228,Raj,21," It's too bad he wasn't here for that hooker. She's exactly his type. A hooker. You know, I bet if we hired her, that would cheer him up.",2,Big Bang Theory,137,28
9229,Leonard,21, We're not going to get Wolowitz a hooker.,2,Big Bang Theory,42,8
9230,Raj,21, â€œI'm so lonely and horny I may open this $20 jar of peanuts and end it all.â€ù,2,Big Bang Theory,81,17
9231,Leonard,21, Suppose it wouldn't hurt to get an estimate.,2,Big Bang Theory,45,8
9233,Sheldon,21," So, how was your day?",2,Big Bang Theory,22,5
9234,Penny,21," Are you trying to make small talk? Oh, sweetie, you really don't have to.",2,Big Bang Theory,74,14
9235,Sheldon,21," No, it's the accepted convention. How was your day?",2,Big Bang Theory,52,9
9236,Penny,21," Well, uh, they shifted my schedule around at the restaurant so my hours are going to be a little different",2,Big Bang Theory,107,20
9237,Sheldon,21," I'm sorry, that's not going to interest me at all, just eat.",2,Big Bang Theory,61,12
9239,Raj,21, Hello again.,2,Big Bang Theory,13,2
9241,Leonard,21," Yeah, hi, listen, m, if you're not busy, well, w-we were thinking you could well, we were wondering",2,Big Bang Theory,100,18
9242,Raj,21, If you're really a prostitute.,2,Big Bang Theory,31,5
9246,Leonard,21," Okay, great. Um uh, the thing is, we've got this friend, and he's kind of down in the dumps, and we thought that maybe you could cheer him up.",2,Big Bang Theory,143,29
9247,Raj,21, With sex.,2,Big Bang Theory,10,2
9248,Leonard,21, I think she knows what I meant.,2,Big Bang Theory,32,7
9249,Raj,21, How can she when you beat around the bush. She's from the mean streets where they shoot from the hip and keep it real.,2,Big Bang Theory,119,24
9251,Leonard,21," Okay, terrific. Um, uh, listen, is there a way that we can do this where he doesn't know that you're a you know",2,Big Bang Theory,112,23
9252,Raj,21, Prostitute.,2,Big Bang Theory,12,1
9254,Leonard,21," Yes, yeah, exactly, the girlfriend experience.",2,Big Bang Theory,47,6
9255,Raj,21," Uh, actually, if it's not too much to ask, could we have the Jewish girlfriend experience.",2,Big Bang Theory,91,16
9257,Sheldon,21," Okay, that's question 20, you have to guess.",2,Big Bang Theory,45,8
9258,Penny,21," Oh, God, I don't know Sheldon, are you Star Wars?",2,Big Bang Theory,50,10
9259,Sheldon,21, How can one person be a whole movie?,2,Big Bang Theory,37,8
9260,Penny,21," Okay, I give up, can we just do something else?",2,Big Bang Theory,48,10
9261,Sheldon,21, Fine. I was Spock. Are you and Leonard friends with benefits.,2,Big Bang Theory,62,11
9262,Penny,21, What?,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
9263,Sheldon,21, Are you and Leonard friends with benefits?,2,Big Bang Theory,43,7
9264,Penny,21," Where did that even come from, did he say we were?",2,Big Bang Theory,51,11
9265,Sheldon,21," No, Leonard said nothing, but who knows what goes on over here when he pretends your mail was misdelivered.",2,Big Bang Theory,108,19
9266,Penny,21," No, just mail, no benefits.",2,Big Bang Theory,28,5
9267,Sheldon,21," Hmm, I see.",2,Big Bang Theory,12,3
9268,Penny,21, Why are you asking?,2,Big Bang Theory,20,4
9269,Sheldon,21," I'm curious about the whole social construct. On its face, the idea of satisfying ones sexual appetite, assuming one is afflicted with such, without emotional entanglement, that seems eminently practical. What I've observed, however, is Howard Wolowitz crying like a little girl.",2,Big Bang Theory,280,42
9270,Penny,21," Well, some people just can't handle that kind of relationship.",2,Big Bang Theory,63,10
9271,Sheldon,21, Can you?,2,Big Bang Theory,9,2
9272,Penny,21, Excuse me?,2,Big Bang Theory,11,2
9273,Sheldon,21, Are you able to have sex with men without developing an emotional attachment?,2,Big Bang Theory,78,13
9274,Penny,21," Sheldon, I really don't want to talk about this with you.",2,Big Bang Theory,58,11
9275,Sheldon,21, Is this conversation making you uncomfortable?,2,Big Bang Theory,47,6
9276,Penny,21," Of course it's making me uncomfortable, can't you tell?",2,Big Bang Theory,56,9
9277,Sheldon,21," I really have no idea. I don't particularly excel at reading facial expressions, body language",2,Big Bang Theory,95,15
9278,Penny,21," I'm uncomfortable, Sheldon!",2,Big Bang Theory,28,3
9279,Sheldon,21," Thank you, that's very helpful.",2,Big Bang Theory,32,5
9281,Howard,21," Alright, where are these amazing shrimp?",2,Big Bang Theory,41,6
9282,Leonard,21, Behold?,2,Big Bang Theory,8,1
9283,Howard,21," Seriously, you think this is the size of a baby's arm?",2,Big Bang Theory,55,11
9284,Raj,21, A little baby.,2,Big Bang Theory,15,3
9285,Howard,21, I'm going back to the room.,2,Big Bang Theory,28,6
9287,Howard,21," Hi there, Howard Wolowitz.",2,Big Bang Theory,27,4
9290,Penny,21," I don't think the manager's coming tonight so, here.",2,Big Bang Theory,53,9
9291,Sheldon,21, Are you suggesting I sleep on the couch.,2,Big Bang Theory,41,8
9292,Penny,21," Well, it wasn't the first suggestion that came to mind, but it's the one I'm going with.",2,Big Bang Theory,89,17
9293,Sheldon,21," I can't sleep on your couch. I sleep in a bed. And given it's dimensions I have no intention of living out E.M. Snickering's beloved children's book , The Tall Man From Cornwall.",2,Big Bang Theory,179,33
9294,Penny,21, What?,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
9295,Sheldon,21," There was a tall man from Cornwall whose length exceeded his bed. My body fits on it, but barely upon it, there's no room for my big Cornish head.",2,Big Bang Theory,147,29
9296,Penny,21," Oh, alright. I will give you my bed on one condition. That you promise to zip your hole for the next eight hours.",2,Big Bang Theory,114,23
9297,Sheldon,21, May I say one last thing.,2,Big Bang Theory,26,6
9298,Penny,21, Only if it doesn't rhyme.,2,Big Bang Theory,26,5
9299,Sheldon,21, Alright. Goodnight.,2,Big Bang Theory,20,2
9302,Howard,21," Really, me too.",2,Big Bang Theory,16,3
9304,Howard,21, Yeah. Excuse me for a moment.,2,Big Bang Theory,30,6
9305,Leonard,21," Hey, how's it going.",2,Big Bang Theory,21,4
9306,Howard,21," Cut the crap, you set this up, didn't you?",2,Big Bang Theory,43,9
9307,Leonard,21, Yes.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
9308,Howard,21," She's a hooker, isn't she.",2,Big Bang Theory,27,5
9309,Raj,21," A prostitute, yes.",2,Big Bang Theory,19,3
9310,Howard,21, You already gave her the money?,2,Big Bang Theory,32,6
9311,Leonard,21, Yes.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
9312,Howard,21, Thank you!,2,Big Bang Theory,11,2
9314,Sheldon,21, Penny.,2,Big Bang Theory,7,1
9315,Penny,21, What?,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
9316,Sheldon,21, I can't sleep. how are you going?,2,Big Bang Theory,34,7
9317,Penny,21, Maybe that's because your hole is still open.,2,Big Bang Theory,46,8
9318,Sheldon,21, I'm homesick.,2,Big Bang Theory,14,2
9319,Penny,21, Your home is twenty feet from here.,2,Big Bang Theory,36,7
9320,Sheldon,21," Twenty feet, twenty light years, it doesn't matter. It's in a galaxy far, far away.",2,Big Bang Theory,84,15
9321,Penny,21, Damn it. What do you want me to do,2,Big Bang Theory,35,9
9322,Sheldon,21, Sing soft kitty.,2,Big Bang Theory,17,3
9323,Penny,21, That's only for when you're sick.,2,Big Bang Theory,34,6
9324,Sheldon,21, Homesick is a type of being sick.,2,Big Bang Theory,34,7
9325,Penny,21," Come on, do I really have to?",2,Big Bang Theory,30,7
9326,Sheldon,21, I suppose we can stay up and talk.,2,Big Bang Theory,35,8
9327,Penny,21," Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, um",2,Big Bang Theory,60,11
9328,Sheldon,21, Sleepy kitty.,2,Big Bang Theory,14,2
9329,Penny,21, Sleepy ki,2,Big Bang Theory,10,2
9330,Sheldon,21, No. Start over.,2,Big Bang Theory,16,3
9331,Penny,21," Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr.",2,Big Bang Theory,89,15
9332,Sheldon,21, Penny.,2,Big Bang Theory,7,1
9333,Penny,21, Yeah.,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
9334,Sheldon,21, Thank you for letting me stay here.,2,Big Bang Theory,36,7
9335,Penny,21," Oh, you're welcome sweetie.",2,Big Bang Theory,28,4
9336,Sheldon,21," Okay, I'm sleepy now, get out.",2,Big Bang Theory,31,6
9338,Sheldon,21," Oh, good, you're finally home.",2,Big Bang Theory,31,5
9339,Leonard,21, What were you doing at Penny's?,2,Big Bang Theory,32,6
9340,Sheldon,21," Well, we had dinner, uh, played some games, and then I spent the night. Oh, you'll be happy to know that I now have a much better understanding of friends with benefits.",2,Big Bang Theory,170,32
9342,Sheldon,22," Smell that? That's the smell of new comic books. Oh, yes!",2,Big Bang Theory,58,11
9343,Howard,22," They're on me today, boys.",2,Big Bang Theory,27,5
9344,Raj,22, You're paying? Have you been selling your sperm again?,2,Big Bang Theory,55,9
9345,Howard,22," No, I'm celebrating. As we speak, the space shuttle is docking at the International Space Station where it will deploy the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Waste Disposal System.",2,Big Bang Theory,168,26
9346,Raj,22," Oh, get over yourself, it's a high-tech toilet.",2,Big Bang Theory,48,8
9347,Leonard,22," Just think. Thanks to your hard work, an international crew of astronauts will boldly go",2,Big Bang Theory,89,15
9348,Howard,22, Is that supposed to be funny?,2,Big Bang Theory,30,6
9349,Sheldon,22, I believe it is. The combination of the Star Trek reference and the play on words involving the double-meaning of the verb to go suggests that Leonard is humorously mocking your efforts in space plumbing.,2,Big Bang Theory,205,35
9350,Howard,22," Okay, make your little jokes, but of the four of us, I'm the only one making any real-world contribution to science and technology.",2,Big Bang Theory,132,23
9351,Raj,22," He's right. This is an important achievement, for two reasons. Number one, and, of course, number two.",2,Big Bang Theory,103,17
9352,Sheldon,22," Oh, clever! Playing on the use of cardinal numbers as euphemisms for bodily functions.",2,Big Bang Theory,87,14
9354,Sheldon,22," Excuse me, spoiler alert.",2,Big Bang Theory,26,4
9356,Sheldon,22," You told me it's mind-blowing, so, my mind is going into it pre-blown. And once a mind is pre-blown, it cannot be re-blown.",2,Big Bang Theory,124,23
9358,Sheldon,22, Said the Grinch to Christmas.,2,Big Bang Theory,30,5
9360,Leonard,22," Oh, sure, what's up?",2,Big Bang Theory,21,4
9362,Leonard,22," Yeah, vaguely.",2,Big Bang Theory,15,2
9363,Raj,22, Sure you remember. You went to the bar and made a fool of yourself trying to pick up strange women.,2,Big Bang Theory,100,20
9364,Leonard,22, What about it?,2,Big Bang Theory,15,3
9366,Leonard,22," Oh, too bad. I guess the thing to do now is just pick yourself up, dust yourself off, forget it and move on.",2,Big Bang Theory,109,23
9368,Leonard,22, Why the hell not?,2,Big Bang Theory,18,4
9370,Sheldon,22," Excuse me, Stuart. Have you read the new Flash?",2,Big Bang Theory,48,9
9372,Sheldon,22," Well, I have and it will knock your socks off! Good luck getting them back on.",2,Big Bang Theory,79,16
9374,Leonard,22, Nobody wants that.,2,Big Bang Theory,19,3
9376,Leonard,22," Uh, oh, gee, my initial reaction is no. You know, let me think about it and get back to you, okay?",2,Big Bang Theory,99,21
9378,Leonard,22," Yeah, or you call me.",2,Big Bang Theory,22,5
9380,Leonard,22, Or nobody calls anyone.,2,Big Bang Theory,24,4
9381,Raj,22, Interesting. Penny's current suitor asking advice from her former suitor.,2,Big Bang Theory,74,10
9382,Leonard,22," You know, thanks for closed-captioning my pain, Raj.",2,Big Bang Theory,53,8
9383,Howard,22," Hey, wanna make sure he gets nowhere with Penny without jeopardizing your friendship with either of them?",2,Big Bang Theory,106,17
9384,Leonard,22, I'm listening.,2,Big Bang Theory,15,2
9385,Howard,22, Just tell him to do everything you've done with her for the last two years.,2,Big Bang Theory,76,15
9387,Penny,22," Hey, Leonard.",2,Big Bang Theory,14,2
9388,Leonard,22," Oh, hi.",2,Big Bang Theory,8,2
9389,Penny,22, How's it going?,2,Big Bang Theory,16,3
9390,Leonard,22," Good, good. You?",2,Big Bang Theory,17,3
9391,Penny,22," Fine. Oh, hey, can I ask you something?",2,Big Bang Theory,40,8
9392,Leonard,22, Sure.,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
9393,Penny,22, You know your friend Stuart?,2,Big Bang Theory,29,5
9394,Leonard,22, Yes.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
9395,Penny,22," Well, he asked me out again and I said yes, and then I started thinking maybe I should talk to you first.",2,Big Bang Theory,106,22
9396,Leonard,22, About what?,2,Big Bang Theory,12,2
9397,Penny,22," Well, does it bother you, me going out with one of your friends? â€˜Cause you know, you and me",2,Big Bang Theory,95,19
9398,Leonard,22," No, no that's the past. I'm really more of a right now kind of guy. You know, living in the moment. Although I do have to live a little in the future, 'cause, well, that's my job. Of course, my fondness for classic science fiction does draw my attention backwards, but those stories often take place in the future. In conclusion, no, it doesn't bother me.",2,Big Bang Theory,356,66
9399,Penny,22," Okay, well, that's really cool of you.",2,Big Bang Theory,39,7
9400,Leonard,22," Yeah, well I wouldn't say cool, I'd just say, that's Leonard!",2,Big Bang Theory,62,11
9401,Penny,22," Well, In that case, do you mind giving me some advice?",2,Big Bang Theory,55,11
9402,Leonard,22, About Stuart? Love to.,2,Big Bang Theory,23,4
9403,Penny,22," He's very shy, how do I make him feel more comfortable around me?",2,Big Bang Theory,66,13
9404,Leonard,22," Well, uh, first of all, don't underestimate the value of discomfort.",2,Big Bang Theory,69,11
9405,Penny,22, Really?,2,Big Bang Theory,8,1
9406,Leonard,22," Well, yeah, Stuart thrives under pressure, that's why he works in a comic book store.",2,Big Bang Theory,86,15
9408,Leonard,22, Oh. It's Stuart.,2,Big Bang Theory,17,3
9409,Sheldon,22, You're not going to answer it?,2,Big Bang Theory,31,6
9410,Leonard,22, He wants to talk about Penny. I don't want to talk about Penny.,2,Big Bang Theory,64,13
9411,Sheldon,22," You're making an assumption. Perhaps the comic book store is on fire, and he needs your assistance.",2,Big Bang Theory,100,17
9412,Leonard,22, Why would he call me?,2,Big Bang Theory,22,5
9413,Sheldon,22," We don't know. And if you don't answer the phone, we can't know.",2,Big Bang Theory,65,13
9414,Leonard,22," I'm not answering the phone, Sheldon.",2,Big Bang Theory,38,6
9415,Sheldon,22," Answer the phone, Leonard.",2,Big Bang Theory,27,4
9416,Leonard,22," No! There, it went to voice mail.",2,Big Bang Theory,34,7
9417,Sheldon,22, Aren't you going to check your messages?,2,Big Bang Theory,41,7
9418,Leonard,22, No.,2,Big Bang Theory,4,1
9419,Sheldon,22," You have to check your messages, the leaving of a message is one half of a social contract which is completed by the checking of the message. If that contract breaks down then all social contracts break down and we descend into anarchy.",2,Big Bang Theory,237,43
9420,Leonard,22, It must be hell inside your head.,2,Big Bang Theory,34,7
9421,Sheldon,22, At times.,2,Big Bang Theory,10,2
9422,Howard,22," Guys, we have a code red.",2,Big Bang Theory,26,6
9423,Sheldon,22," Do you mean code red the hospital emergency alert, code red the computer worm, or code red the cherry flavoured soft drink from the makers of Mountain Dew?",2,Big Bang Theory,156,28
9424,Howard,22," Look, I was going over the schematics on my zero-G toilet, and I made a teeny tiny mistake on the specifications for the diverter valve.",2,Big Bang Theory,137,25
9425,Leonard,22, How teeny tiny?,2,Big Bang Theory,16,3
9426,Howard,22, It's gonna fail after about ten flushes.,2,Big Bang Theory,41,7
9427,Sheldon,22, But the mission is for six months.,2,Big Bang Theory,35,7
9428,Howard,22," Yeah, see, that's the code red. It's kind of like a jack-in-the-box, no one knows exactly when, but at some point something way worse than a puppet is gonna pop out of that box.",2,Big Bang Theory,178,34
9429,Sheldon,22, Have you notified NASA?,2,Big Bang Theory,24,4
9430,Howard,22, No. Are you crazy?What am I gonna say? I screwed up your toilet and pretty soon there's gonna be crap floating all over your nice shiny space station?,2,Big Bang Theory,151,28
9431,Leonard,22," Well, what are you gonna do?",2,Big Bang Theory,29,6
9432,Howard,22," I'm gonna figure out how to fix it, then I'll tell them.",2,Big Bang Theory,57,12
9433,Leonard,22," So, what do you need us for?",2,Big Bang Theory,29,7
9434,Raj,22, He can't figure out how to fix it.,2,Big Bang Theory,35,8
9435,Howard,22," Hey, you said you were gonna be supportive.",2,Big Bang Theory,44,8
9436,Raj,22," I'm trying, but you have to admit this is pretty damn funny.",2,Big Bang Theory,61,12
9437,Sheldon,22, I agree. It's the juxtaposition of the high-tech nature of space exploration against the banality of a malfunctioning toilet that provides the comic fodder here. Check your messages.,2,Big Bang Theory,183,28
9439,Howard,22," All right, this is an exact duplicate of the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Human Waste Disposal System as deployed on the International Space Station.",2,Big Bang Theory,143,22
9440,Raj,22, Don't you mean the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Human Waste Distribution System?,2,Big Bang Theory,74,10
9441,Leonard,22, Good one.,2,Big Bang Theory,10,2
9442,Raj,22, Yeah.,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
9443,Howard,22," Yeah, ha, it's hilarious. Now, here's an approximation of the spare parts available on the Space Station. We gotta find a way, using nothing but this, to reinforce this so the waste material avoids the spinning turbine.",2,Big Bang Theory,220,37
9444,Raj,22, You mean so it doesn't hit the fan?,2,Big Bang Theory,36,8
9445,Sheldon,22," Yeah, I have to say, I thought the toilet humour would get less funny with repetition. Apparently, there is no law of diminishing comedic returns with space poop. ",2,Big Bang Theory,164,28
9447,Leonard,22, Hey Stuart.,2,Big Bang Theory,12,2
9449,Leonard,22, Um,2,Big Bang Theory,3,1
9450,Howard,22," Classified, Leonard.",2,Big Bang Theory,21,2
9451,Leonard,22," Yeah, it's a regular Manhattan Project. What's up?",2,Big Bang Theory,51,8
9453,Leonard,22," Yeah, I'm sorry, it's been broken.",2,Big Bang Theory,35,6
9455,Leonard,22," Yeah, that too. Everything's broken.",2,Big Bang Theory,37,5
9457,Leonard,22," All right, well, off the top of my head, I think the most important thing with Penny is to go really slow. I mean, glacial.",2,Big Bang Theory,124,25
9459,Leonard,22," You know, guys come onto her all the time, so, you need to, like, set yourself apart. You know, be a little shy, don't make too much eye contact. And, you know, treat her with, like, cool detachment and, and, and, you know, fear.",2,Big Bang Theory,230,44
9461,Leonard,22," Yeah, like, you're afraid that if you touch her, she'll break.",2,Big Bang Theory,63,11
9463,Leonard,22," Good, good. Well, you kids have fun tonight.",2,Big Bang Theory,45,8
9465,Howard,22, You don't know what this is?,2,Big Bang Theory,29,6
9467,Howard,22, Good. Get out.,2,Big Bang Theory,15,3
9468,Raj,22," Be afraid of Penny, nice, very crafty.",2,Big Bang Theory,39,7
9469,Leonard,22, It wasn't bad advice. It just wasn't particularly helpful.,2,Big Bang Theory,59,9
9470,Sheldon,22," For what it's worth, my mother says that when we deceive for personal gain, we make Jesus cry.",2,Big Bang Theory,95,18
9472,Sheldon,22," All right, what if we use this two-inch PVC to reinforce the centre cross-support?",2,Big Bang Theory,83,14
9473,Howard,22," No good. I mean, it might work for the Japanese and the Americans, but have you seen the size of the Russians they got up there? This thing has to hold up against a hearty potato-based diet.",2,Big Bang Theory,191,37
9474,Leonard,22, I feel terrible.,2,Big Bang Theory,17,3
9475,Howard,22," Maybe if you were helping, you'd feel better about yourself.",2,Big Bang Theory,61,10
9476,Leonard,22, I deliberately tried to sabotage Stuart's date with Penny.,2,Big Bang Theory,59,9
9477,Raj,22," Of course you feel terrible. You completely screwed up your karma, dude.",2,Big Bang Theory,73,12
9478,Sheldon,22," You don't really believe in that superstition, do you?",2,Big Bang Theory,55,9
9479,Raj,22," It's not superstition. It's practically Newtonian. For every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction. Leonard pretends to be a friend and acts like a two-faced bitch, therefore, he is reborn as a banana slug. It's actually a very elegant system, you know, what goes around comes around.",2,Big Bang Theory,294,48
9480,Howard,22, Speaking of what goes around comes around,2,Big Bang Theory,42,7
9481,Raj,22," Okay, look. Instead of trying to reinforce this structure here, what if we just ran another line, bypass it entirely?",2,Big Bang Theory,118,20
9482,Sheldon,22, It won't work. The diameter of the tubing is insufficient.,2,Big Bang Theory,59,10
9483,Raj,22, What if we reposition the collection tank?,2,Big Bang Theory,43,7
9484,Sheldon,22, It won't work. No way to mount it.,2,Big Bang Theory,35,8
9485,Howard,22," Okay, here's an idea. What if I change my name and go live with my cousin and her husband Avi in Israel?",2,Big Bang Theory,105,22
9486,Sheldon,22, That could work.,2,Big Bang Theory,17,3
9488,Leonard,22, Morning.,2,Big Bang Theory,9,1
9489,Penny,22, Morning. What's up?,2,Big Bang Theory,20,3
9490,Leonard,22, Nothing. We just pulled an all-nighter trying to fix a zero-gravity pasta maker. I'm gonna make a coffee run. Do you want any?,2,Big Bang Theory,127,23
9491,Penny,22," Oh, no, thanks. I have coffee.",2,Big Bang Theory,31,6
9492,Leonard,22, Great. So how'd it go with Stuart last night?,2,Big Bang Theory,46,9
9493,Penny,22, I really don't want to talk about it.,2,Big Bang Theory,38,8
9494,Leonard,22," Yeah. Right. Sure. The thing is, before you guys went out, I spoke to him and",2,Big Bang Theory,78,16
9495,Penny,22, I said I don't want to talk about it.,2,Big Bang Theory,38,9
9496,Leonard,22, Okay I just I kind of,2,Big Bang Theory,22,6
9497,Penny,22," Look, Leonard, what goes on between me and Stuart is none of your business. So just leave it alone, okay?",2,Big Bang Theory,106,20
9498,Raj,22," If you really want to clean up your karma, go get my freakin' latte.",2,Big Bang Theory,69,14
9500,Howard,22," Hang on, I think I've got this. Help me see if we can wedge this little piece of PVC behind the support rod.",2,Big Bang Theory,109,23
9501,Sheldon,22, You're overestimating the tensile strength of the substructure you're building.,2,Big Bang Theory,80,10
9502,Howard,22," Sheldon, I know what I'm doing.",2,Big Bang Theory,32,6
9503,Sheldon,22," If you knew what you were doing, there wouldn't be a space toilet where my coffee table should be.",2,Big Bang Theory,99,19
9504,Raj,22," Howard, wait. Why don't you use this instead of the PVC to keep the transverse filter assembly in place?",2,Big Bang Theory,105,19
9505,Howard,22, Because this is not a spare part from the space station. This is the thing from the pizza box that keeps the lid from touching the cheese.,2,Big Bang Theory,139,27
9506,Raj,22," That what that's for? In India, the lid just touches the cheese. Of course, we also have rampant poverty and periodic outbreaks of cholera, so a little cardboard in our cheese is no biggie.",2,Big Bang Theory,190,34
9507,Howard,22, Where are you going?,2,Big Bang Theory,21,4
9508,Leonard,22, Comic book store.,2,Big Bang Theory,18,3
9509,Sheldon,22," Oh, an excellent idea! I could certainly use a break.",2,Big Bang Theory,54,10
9510,Raj,22," Me, too.",2,Big Bang Theory,9,2
9511,Howard,22," Hold on, you can go to the comic book store when man can once again safely poop in space.",2,Big Bang Theory,90,19
9512,Sheldon,22, Why does Leonard get to go?,2,Big Bang Theory,28,6
9513,Leonard,22," â€˜Cause he's upset over his situation with Penny and if I have to hear about it again, I'm going to kick him in his ovaries.",2,Big Bang Theory,126,25
9514,Leonard,22," Thanks for understanding, Howard.",2,Big Bang Theory,34,4
9515,Howard,22," I got your back, sister. All right, I think we've got a prototype ready to test. Hand me that Tupperware.",2,Big Bang Theory,106,20
9516,Raj,22," Wow, that's heavy.",2,Big Bang Theory,19,3
9517,Howard,22," Damn right it's heavy, it's my mother's meat loaf, it's been testing toilets for generations.",2,Big Bang Theory,94,15
9518,Sheldon,22," I must say, Howard, I think a detailed letter to MIT describing your current circumstances might entitle you to a refund on your master's degree.",2,Big Bang Theory,146,25
9519,Howard,22," Okay, simulated zero-gravity human waste disposal test with meat loaf analog in three, two, one. ",2,Big Bang Theory,98,15
9520,Sheldon,22, Fascinating.,2,Big Bang Theory,13,1
9521,Raj,22, What do you think the problem is?,2,Big Bang Theory,34,7
9522,Howard,22, Not enough bread crumbs.,2,Big Bang Theory,25,4
9524,Leonard,22," Hey, Stuart, I need to talk to you.",2,Big Bang Theory,36,8
9526,Leonard,22," I think I gave you bad advice about Penny, and I want to apologize.",2,Big Bang Theory,68,14
9528,Leonard,22, It was?,2,Big Bang Theory,8,2
9530,Leonard,22, You're kidding. Never worked for me.,2,Big Bang Theory,37,6
9532,Leonard,22, Wine? I didn't say to give her wine.,2,Big Bang Theory,37,8
9534,Leonard,22," During the kissing? What did you do, sneeze in her mouth? I did that to a girl once.",2,Big Bang Theory,85,18
9536,Leonard,22, Leonard?,2,Big Bang Theory,9,1
9538,Leonard,22," Yeah, no, yeah, wow, I'm sorry. That must've been the last thing you wanted to hear.",2,Big Bang Theory,85,16
9540,Leonard,22," No doubt, no doubt. Okay, well, I'm sorry it didn't work out.",2,Big Bang Theory,62,12
9542,Leonard,22," Yeah, how about that? See you soon.",2,Big Bang Theory,36,7
9545,Howard,22," Yes, sir, I understand classified. We'll keep it all classified, no one has to know but you and me.",2,Big Bang Theory,100,19
9546,Penny,22, What's classified?,2,Big Bang Theory,19,2
9547,Leonard,22, Howard's space toilet. I'll tell you later.,2,Big Bang Theory,44,7
9548,Howard,22," Well, they've deployed our solution. Let's just all hope it works.",2,Big Bang Theory,67,11
9549,Sheldon,22," I don't see why I have to worry. My career's not hanging in the balance. That was a joke. It's funny, because it's true.",2,Big Bang Theory,121,24
9550,Penny,22," Leonard, could you pass the soy sauce, please?",2,Big Bang Theory,47,8
9551,Leonard,22," I'm sorry, were you talking to me?",2,Big Bang Theory,35,7
9552,Penny,22," Yeah, I said Leonard.",2,Big Bang Theory,22,4
9553,Leonard,22," Yes, you did, didn't you?",2,Big Bang Theory,26,5
9554,Penny,22, What the hell is that?,2,Big Bang Theory,23,5
9555,Howard,22, Meatloaf.,2,Big Bang Theory,10,1
9556,Leonard,22, What was it doing on the ceiling?,2,Big Bang Theory,34,7
9557,Howard,22, That's classified.,2,Big Bang Theory,19,2
9565,Sheldon,23," Oh, boy.",2,Big Bang Theory,9,2
9566,Leonard,23, What?,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
9567,Sheldon,23, I can't comment without violating our agreement that I don't criticize your work.,2,Big Bang Theory,82,13
9568,Leonard,23," Then what was oh, boy?",2,Big Bang Theory,23,5
9569,Sheldon,23, Great restraint on my part.,2,Big Bang Theory,28,5
9570,Leonard,23, There's nothing wrong with the science here.,2,Big Bang Theory,45,7
9571,Sheldon,23, Perhaps you mean a different thing than I do when you say science.,2,Big Bang Theory,67,13
9572,Leonard,23," Okay, how's that?",2,Big Bang Theory,18,3
9573,Sheldon,23," You actually had it right in the first place. Once again, you've fallen for one of my classic pranks. Bazinga! Well, now here's a peculiar e-mail. The president of the university wants me to meet him at his office tomorrow morning at 8 a.m.",2,Big Bang Theory,241,44
9574,Leonard,23, Why?,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
9575,Leonard,23," Yes, how did we live before Twitter? I guess you'll find out what it is in the morning.",2,Big Bang Theory,88,18
9576,Sheldon,23," That's 14 hours away. For the next 840 minutes, I'm effectively one of Heisenberg's particles, I know where I am or I know how fast I'm going, but I can't know both. Yet how am I supposed to carry on with this huge annoying thing hovering over my head?",2,Big Bang Theory,253,49
9577,Leonard,23," Yeah, I know the feeling.",2,Big Bang Theory,26,5
9579,Sheldon,23,  Leonard.  Leonard.  Leonard.,2,Big Bang Theory,30,3
9580,Leonard,23," Sheldon, it's two o'clock in the morning.",2,Big Bang Theory,42,7
9581,Sheldon,23, Why is everybody keep telling me what time it is?,2,Big Bang Theory,50,10
9582,Leonard,23, Everybody?,2,Big Bang Theory,11,1
9583,Sheldon,23," You, the president of the university, his wife, their sullen teenage daughter. That entire family is fascinated by what time it is and whether people know it.",2,Big Bang Theory,159,27
9584,Leonard,23, You went to President Seibert's house in the middle of the night?,2,Big Bang Theory,66,12
9585,Sheldon,23," He didn't respond to my e-mail, his phone number is unlisted. Tell me what my other option was.",2,Big Bang Theory,96,18
9586,Leonard,23," You could have waited until morning. I know, look who I'm talking to.",2,Big Bang Theory,70,13
9587,Sheldon,23, Do you remember the grant proposal I submitted to the National Science Foundation to detect slow-moving monopoles at the magnetic North Pole?,2,Big Bang Theory,142,22
9588,Leonard,23, Hardly a day goes by when I don't think about it.,2,Big Bang Theory,50,11
9589,Sheldon,23," Aw, how nice. Well, a space opened up at the last minute on the NSF expedition to the Arctic Circle.",2,Big Bang Theory,101,20
9590,Leonard,23, Wait a minute. He offered to send you to the North Pole?,2,Big Bang Theory,57,12
9591,Sheldon,23," Yes. In fact, he was quite enthusiastic. He said, â€œFrankly, if I could send you tonight, I would.â€ù",2,Big Bang Theory,103,18
9592,Leonard,23," Okay, well, do you want to go?",2,Big Bang Theory,31,7
9593,Sheldon,23," Of course not. I'm a theoretical physicist, a career I chose in no small part because it's indoors, but if I'm able to detect slow-moving magnetic monopoles there, I will be the scientist to confirm string theory. People will write books about me. Third-graders will create macaroni-art dioramas depicting scenes from my life.",2,Big Bang Theory,327,53
9594,Leonard,23," Sure, maybe a tableau of me trying to pummel you to death.",2,Big Bang Theory,59,12
9595,Sheldon,23, Sarcasm?,2,Big Bang Theory,9,1
9596,Leonard,23, Maybe.,2,Big Bang Theory,7,1
9597,Sheldon,23," I'm on the horns of a dilemma. Can you imagine me, Sheldon Cooper, at the North Pole?",2,Big Bang Theory,86,17
9598,Leonard,23," Easy peasy, I'm doing it right now.",2,Big Bang Theory,36,7
9599,Sheldon,23," I'm not good with cold, Leonard. How often have we had to leave a movie theatre because I got a headache from drinking the Icee too fast? I can't go.",2,Big Bang Theory,150,30
9600,Leonard,23," Well, then don't go.",2,Big Bang Theory,21,4
9601,Sheldon,23, How can you say that? The scientific opportunity of a lifetime presents itself and my best friend says don't go.,2,Big Bang Theory,113,20
9602,Leonard,23," All right, then go.",2,Big Bang Theory,20,4
9603,Sheldon,23, Listen to you. How can I possibly go?,2,Big Bang Theory,38,8
9604,Leonard,23," Sheldon, what are the words I can say right now to end this conversation and let me go back to sleep?",2,Big Bang Theory,102,21
9605,Sheldon,23," Odd, President Seibert posed the exact same question.",2,Big Bang Theory,54,8
9606,Leonard,23, How was it resolved?,2,Big Bang Theory,21,4
9607,Sheldon,23, It wasn't. His wife set their dogs on me and rendered the question moot.,2,Big Bang Theory,73,14
9609,Howard,23," Just imagine. If he says yes, we'll have an entire summer without Sheldon.",2,Big Bang Theory,75,13
9610,Raj,23, We could play outside.,2,Big Bang Theory,23,4
9611,Howard,23, We could sit on the left side of the couch.,2,Big Bang Theory,44,10
9612,Raj,23," Our dreams are very small, aren't they?",2,Big Bang Theory,40,7
9613,Sheldon,23," Good news, gentlemen, I have tentatively accepted",2,Big Bang Theory,50,7
9615,Sheldon,23, the invitation to join the Arctic Expedition.,2,Big Bang Theory,46,7
9616,Leonard,23, It's not gonna be the same without you.,2,Big Bang Theory,40,8
9617,Howard,23, Godspeed.,2,Big Bang Theory,10,1
9618,Sheldon,23," Thank you, but your sentiments may be premature.",2,Big Bang Theory,49,8
9619,Raj,23," Ooh, I don't like where this is going.",2,Big Bang Theory,39,8
9620,Sheldon,23, I would like to propose that the three of you accompany me.,2,Big Bang Theory,60,12
9621,Howard,23, To the North Pole?,2,Big Bang Theory,19,4
9622,Sheldon,23, Yes.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
9623,Raj,23, Is this just so we won't touch your stuff while you're away?,2,Big Bang Theory,61,12
9624,Sheldon,23," I'll admit that was a concern. But the fact is, I'll need a support team. And the three of you are my first choice.",2,Big Bang Theory,116,24
9625,Howard,23, Really?,2,Big Bang Theory,8,1
9626,Sheldon,23," Well, there are others who might be more qualified, but the thought of interviewing them gave me a stomach ache. Now, I know I'm proposing an enormous undertaking, so why don't you take a few moments to discuss it?",2,Big Bang Theory,215,39
9627,Howard,23," We're not really gonna go to the North Pole with him, are we?",2,Big Bang Theory,62,13
9628,Sheldon,23, I'm still within earshot! You may want to wait for my door to close.,2,Big Bang Theory,69,14
9629,Howard,23," We're not really gonna go to the North Pole with him, are we?",2,Big Bang Theory,62,13
9630,Leonard,23, Hang on. Let's talk about it. This is a National Science Foundation expedition. I don't know how we can turn it down.,2,Big Bang Theory,118,22
9631,Howard,23," Easy. Instead of saying, no, we don't want to go on an NSF expedition, say, no, we don't want to spend â€œthree months stuck in a cabin in the Arctic Circle with an anal nutbag.â€ù",2,Big Bang Theory,181,35
9632,Raj,23," But if we were part of the team that confirmed string theory, we could drink for free in any bar in any college town with a university that has a strong science program.",2,Big Bang Theory,170,33
9633,Leonard,23," Howard, this is big science. You could be the engineer who builds the equipment that puts us on the cover of magazines.",2,Big Bang Theory,120,22
9634,Howard,23, I could also be the engineer who builds the crossbow that kills Sheldon.,2,Big Bang Theory,73,13
9635,Raj,23, You still might get on a magazine.,2,Big Bang Theory,35,7
9636,Howard,23, So you guys are seriously considering this?,2,Big Bang Theory,44,7
9637,Leonard,23, Yes.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
9638,Howard,23, And you think you can put up with Sheldon?,2,Big Bang Theory,43,9
9639,Raj,23," Well, I'm a Hindu. My religion teaches that if we suffer in this life we are rewarded in the next. Three months at the North Pole with Sheldon and I'm reborn as a well-hung billionaire with wings!",2,Big Bang Theory,197,37
9640,Sheldon,23," Well, gentlemen, have you reached a decision?",2,Big Bang Theory,46,7
9641,Leonard,23, I'm in.,2,Big Bang Theory,8,2
9642,Raj,23," Me, too.",2,Big Bang Theory,9,2
9643,Howard,23," Oh, damn it. Peer pressure. Fine.",2,Big Bang Theory,34,6
9644,Sheldon,23," Excellent. And just an FYI, as I am the expedition's team leader, protocol dictates that be phrased fine, sir. But don't worry, there will be a briefing.",2,Big Bang Theory,154,27
9646,Sheldon,23,  Penny.,2,Big Bang Theory,8,1
9647,Penny,23,  Sheldon.,2,Big Bang Theory,10,1
9648,Sheldon,23,  Penny.,2,Big Bang Theory,8,1
9649,Penny,23,  Sheldon.,2,Big Bang Theory,10,1
9650,Sheldon,23,  Penny.,2,Big Bang Theory,8,1
9651,Penny,23,  Sheldon.,2,Big Bang Theory,10,1
9652,Sheldon,23,  Penny.,2,Big Bang Theory,8,1
9653,Penny,23,  Sheldon.,2,Big Bang Theory,10,1
9654,Sheldon,23,  Penny.,2,Big Bang Theory,8,1
9655,Penny,23,  Sheldon.,2,Big Bang Theory,10,1
9656,Sheldon,23,  Penny.,2,Big Bang Theory,8,1
9657,Penny,23,  Sheldon.,2,Big Bang Theory,10,1
9658,Sheldon,23,  Penny.,2,Big Bang Theory,8,1
9659,Penny,23, What do you want?,2,Big Bang Theory,18,4
9660,Sheldon,23, I need access to the Cheesecake Factory's walk-in freezer.,2,Big Bang Theory,59,9
9661,Penny,23," Now, honey, I already told you, the hamburger meat is fresh and stored at a safe temperature.",2,Big Bang Theory,94,17
9662,Sheldon,23, No. This is to train for a three-month expedition to the magnetic North Pole.,2,Big Bang Theory,78,14
9663,Penny,23, What?,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
9664,Sheldon,23," I don't know how that sentence could possibly confuse you, but to elaborate, I'm going to the Arctic Circle with Leonard, Wolowitz and Koothrappali.",2,Big Bang Theory,149,24
9665,Penny,23, You're all going?,2,Big Bang Theory,18,3
9666,Sheldon,23, Yes.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
9667,Penny,23, For three months?,2,Big Bang Theory,18,3
9668,Sheldon,23, Yes.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
9669,Penny,23, Excuse me.,2,Big Bang Theory,11,2
9670,Sheldon,23, Is that a yes or a no on the freezer? The woman has the attention span of a gnat.,2,Big Bang Theory,82,19
9671,Penny,23," Hey, Leonard.",2,Big Bang Theory,14,2
9672,Leonard,23, Hi.,2,Big Bang Theory,4,1
9673,Penny,23, Sheldon says you're going to the North Pole.,2,Big Bang Theory,45,8
9674,Leonard,23," Yeah. Pretty cool, huh?",2,Big Bang Theory,24,4
9675,Penny,23, Yeah. I'm just a little surprised you didn't tell me.,2,Big Bang Theory,54,10
9676,Leonard,23," Oh, well, it all happened kind of fast, and we had to get physicals and buy thermal underwear and study up on, you know, snow and stuff. Sorry, I was gonna tell you.",2,Big Bang Theory,166,33
9677,Penny,23," Oh, hey, no, you don't have to apologize. There's no reason you have to tell me. I was just, you know, surprised.",2,Big Bang Theory,114,22
9678,Sheldon,23," Yes, yes, you were busy, you were surprised, all very fascinating. Now where do we stand on the freezer?",2,Big Bang Theory,105,19
9679,Penny,23, Is he serious?,2,Big Bang Theory,15,3
9680,Leonard,23," Actually, it would help.",2,Big Bang Theory,25,4
9681,Penny,23," All right, I'll see what I can do. So, three months at the North Pole. Wow, that is awesome.",2,Big Bang Theory,93,19
9682,Leonard,23, Yeah.,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
9683,Sheldon,23," I'm sorry, but at what point do you put this see what you can do plan into action?",2,Big Bang Theory,83,18
9684,Penny,23," Just a warning, Sheldon, the freezer locks from the outside.",2,Big Bang Theory,61,10
9685,Leonard,23, Did she seem upset to you?,2,Big Bang Theory,27,6
9686,Sheldon,23, No. Did she seem upset to you?,2,Big Bang Theory,31,7
9687,Leonard,23, No.,2,Big Bang Theory,4,1
9688,Sheldon,23," Oh, good, I got it right. Are you upset?",2,Big Bang Theory,41,9
9689,Leonard,23, A little bit.,2,Big Bang Theory,14,3
9690,Sheldon,23, Two for two. I'm on fire.,2,Big Bang Theory,26,6
9691,Leonard,23," I mean, I know she's not my girlfriend or anything, but wouldn't you think she'd feel a little bad that I'm going to be gone for the whole summer?",2,Big Bang Theory,147,29
9692,Sheldon,23," That feels like a bonus question. I'm going to stop here while I'm ahead, but I've had a great time.",2,Big Bang Theory,101,20
9694,Sheldon,23," Alright, now the purpose of this drill is to acclimate us to the use of tools in extreme temperatures such as we will face in the Arctic Circle.",2,Big Bang Theory,145,28
9695,Raj,23, Where are your tools?,2,Big Bang Theory,22,4
9696,Sheldon,23," Right here. All right, team, open up your practice kits. As the university did not permit me to bring the actual equipment we'll be using to the Cheesecake Factory, because apparently I'm â€œridiculous,â€ù I've provided substitutes which will exercise your fine motor skills. Leonard, you will be doing a series of complex mathematical problems on a vintage Casio model 1175 calculator watch I received when I won the Earth Science medal in 3rd grade. Treat it with respect. Raj, you will be painting sideburns and a Van Dyke on a six-inch figurine of Legolas the elf. Now, remember, a Van Dyke is a goatee without a moustache. Wolowitz, you will be completing a series of delicate surgical procedures on the classic children's game, Operation. To begin with, you will remove funny bone for two hundred dollars.",2,Big Bang Theory,812,136
9697,Howard,23, For this I went to MIT.,2,Big Bang Theory,24,6
9698,Sheldon,23, And begin.,2,Big Bang Theory,11,2
9699,Raj,23, I think I swallowed some paint!,2,Big Bang Theory,32,6
9700,Leonard,23," I can't press any of the buttons with my gloves. Oh, son of a bitch!",2,Big Bang Theory,69,15
9701,Sheldon,23, Adversity is to be expected. Continue.,2,Big Bang Theory,39,6
9702,Howard,23," Oh, boy, am I gonna get sued.",2,Big Bang Theory,30,7
9703,Leonard,23," Okay, I can't do this.",2,Big Bang Theory,23,5
9704,Raj,23, Me either.,2,Big Bang Theory,11,2
9705,Sheldon,23," Gentlemen, use your imagination. Innovate. Did Han Solo let Luke Skywalker freeze to death on the ice planet of Hoth? No. He cut open a tauntaun and used its internal body heat to warm him up.",2,Big Bang Theory,193,36
9706,Howard,23, You heard the man. Hold him down and I'll cut him open.,2,Big Bang Theory,56,12
9707,Leonard,23," Hang on, I know I don't possess the tools of leadership, but I don't understand why we can't assemble the equipment inside the hut and then take it outside.",2,Big Bang Theory,157,29
9708,Sheldon,23, I hadn't thought of that. I guess we're done here.,2,Big Bang Theory,51,10
9710,Sheldon,23," Here, drink slash eat this.",2,Big Bang Theory,28,5
9711,Leonard,23, What is it?,2,Big Bang Theory,12,3
9712,Sheldon,23, It's hot chocolate with a stick of butter.,2,Big Bang Theory,43,8
9713,Howard,23," Okay, why?",2,Big Bang Theory,11,2
9714,Sheldon,23," Because in the frigid temperatures in the Arctic, we need to consume at least 5,000 calories a day just to maintain our body weight.",2,Big Bang Theory,133,24
9715,Leonard,23," Sheldon, you know I can't eat butter. I'm lactose intolerant.",2,Big Bang Theory,62,10
9716,Sheldon,23," Way ahead of you, that's an â€œI Can't Believe It's Not Butterâ€ù stick.",2,Big Bang Theory,73,13
9717,Raj,23," But mummy, all the other guys are going to the North Pole.",2,Big Bang Theory,59,12
9719,Raj,23," If you were standing behind me nagging, I might.",2,Big Bang Theory,49,9
9721,Raj,23," No, it's not. Howard, tell them.",2,Big Bang Theory,33,6
9722,Howard,23," Doctor and Mrs. Koothrappali, namaste. I understand your concern, but if it'll make you feel any better, my mother is fine with me going, and this is a woman who kept a safety rail on my bed until I was 17.",2,Big Bang Theory,207,41
9724,Sheldon,23," That's very unlikely, Mrs. Koothrappali. If Raj dies, it'll be from frostbite, gangrene, acute sunburn or being ripped to shreds by a fifteen hundred pound polar bear.",2,Big Bang Theory,168,27
9725,Howard,23," Ma, I'm putting you on speakerphone with Raj's parents. Can you tell them that you're okay with me going to the Arctic?",2,Big Bang Theory,120,22
9727,Howard,23, I didn't say that. You never listen to me!,2,Big Bang Theory,43,9
9729,Penny,23," Hey, Leonard, can I talk to you for a sec?",2,Big Bang Theory,43,10
9730,Leonard,23," Sure, but let's go out here where there's a little less yelling and guilt. What's up?",2,Big Bang Theory,86,16
9731,Penny,23," Well, I got you a little going away present.",2,Big Bang Theory,45,9
9732,Leonard,23," Oh, a blanket.",2,Big Bang Theory,15,3
9733,Penny,23," Oh, no, no, no, not just a blanket. See, it has sleeves. Yeah! So, you can, you know, be all snoodled up while you do your science stuff.",2,Big Bang Theory,138,28
9734,Leonard,23," Oh, wow, cool.",2,Big Bang Theory,15,3
9735,Penny,23," Oh, I'm gonna miss you.  See you later.",2,Big Bang Theory,40,8
9736,Leonard,23, Bye.,2,Big Bang Theory,5,1
9740,Leonard,23," Sheldon, Sheldon?",2,Big Bang Theory,18,2
9741,Sheldon,23," I want a cookie, Meemaw.",2,Big Bang Theory,25,5
9742,Leonard,23," Sheldon, it's me.",2,Big Bang Theory,18,3
9743,Sheldon,23, But Meemaw just made cookies.,2,Big Bang Theory,30,5
9744,Leonard,23," Listen, I don't know if I can go on the expedition.",2,Big Bang Theory,52,11
9745,Sheldon,23, What?,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
9746,Leonard,23, I don't think I can go to the North Pole.,2,Big Bang Theory,42,10
9747,Sheldon,23," Okay, Leonard, I know you're concerned about disappointing me but I want you to take comfort from the knowledge that my expectations of you are very low.",2,Big Bang Theory,154,27
9748,Leonard,23," Yeah, that's very comforting.",2,Big Bang Theory,30,4
9749,Sheldon,23," Comforting is a part of leadership. It's not a part I care for, but such is my burden.",2,Big Bang Theory,87,18
9750,Leonard,23," Terrific, it's just that I don't think Penny wants me to go.",2,Big Bang Theory,61,12
9751,Sheldon,23," Assuming that's a valid reason not to go, which it isn't, how do you know this? Did she say it?",2,Big Bang Theory,96,20
9752,Leonard,23, Not exactly. But she said she was gonna miss me and she gave me this.,2,Big Bang Theory,70,15
9753,Sheldon,23, What is it?,2,Big Bang Theory,12,3
9754,Leonard,23, It's a blanket with sleeves.,2,Big Bang Theory,29,5
9755,Sheldon,23," Oh, that's clever. Let me see if I understand this correctly. Her missing you is an emotional state you find desirable?",2,Big Bang Theory,120,21
9756,Leonard,23," Yes, obviously.",2,Big Bang Theory,16,2
9757,Sheldon,23," All right. Well, given that missing you is predicated on you leaving, logic dictates you must leave.",2,Big Bang Theory,101,17
9758,Leonard,23," Yes, okay, but I'm gonna be gone for three months. What if she doesn't miss me that long and she meets someone else?",2,Big Bang Theory,117,23
9759,Sheldon,23, She does have a short attention span.,2,Big Bang Theory,38,7
9760,Leonard,23," So, I can't go.",2,Big Bang Theory,16,4
9761,Sheldon,23," Leonard, you may be right. It appears that Penny secretly wants you in her life in a very intimate and carnal fashion.",2,Big Bang Theory,119,22
9762,Leonard,23, You really think so?,2,Big Bang Theory,21,4
9763,Sheldon,23," Of course not. Even in my sleep-deprived state, I've managed to pull off another one of my classic pranks. Bazinga!",2,Big Bang Theory,116,20
9765,Penny,23," Oh, Leonard, what time is it?",2,Big Bang Theory,30,6
9766,Leonard,23," It's 7 a.m. I'm sorry it's early, but we're leaving soon, and I needed to talk to you.",2,Big Bang Theory,87,18
9767,Penny,23, Okay.,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
9768,Leonard,23, What did you mean when you said you're going to miss me?,2,Big Bang Theory,57,12
9769,Penny,23," Um, I don't know. You'll be gone and I'll notice.",2,Big Bang Theory,50,10
9770,Leonard,23," Okay, well, um, what about this? What does this mean?",2,Big Bang Theory,54,10
9771,Penny,23," Wine, credit card and late night television are a bad combination.",2,Big Bang Theory,67,11
9772,Leonard,23," All right, fine. What about that really long hug? What did that mean?",2,Big Bang Theory,70,13
9773,Penny,23, That wasn't a long hug.,2,Big Bang Theory,24,5
9774,Leonard,23, It was at least five Mississippis. A standard hug is two Mississippis tops.,2,Big Bang Theory,76,13
9775,Penny,23," Leonard, I don't know what to tell you. It was just a hug.",2,Big Bang Theory,59,13
9776,Leonard,23, Glad we cleared that up.,2,Big Bang Theory,25,5
9777,Penny,23, Yeah.,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
9778,Leonard,23, I guess I'll see you.,2,Big Bang Theory,22,5
9779,Penny,23," Okay, have a safe trip.",2,Big Bang Theory,24,5
9780,Leonard,23, Thank you. Bye.,2,Big Bang Theory,16,3
9781,Penny,23," Okay, bye.  Means I wish you weren't going.",2,Big Bang Theory,44,8
9783,Leonard,23, Damn it.,2,Big Bang Theory,9,2
9784,Howard,23, What?,2,Big Bang Theory,6,1
9785,Leonard,23, We're out of ice.,2,Big Bang Theory,18,4
9786,Sheldon,23," All right, men, we begin initial assembly and deployment of the testing equipment starting tomorrow at 0700 hours, but until then, you are all off duty. I suggest you keep the shenanigans to a minimum as medical help is 18 hours away by dogsled.",2,Big Bang Theory,246,44
9787,Raj,23, What are you working on?,2,Big Bang Theory,25,5
9788,Howard,23, Crossbow.,2,Big Bang Theory,10,1
9789,Leonard,23," Hey, guys, can I just say something? How about we take a moment to think about where we are right now? This is literally the top of the world. Only a handful of people in all of human history will ever see what we are going to see.",2,Big Bang Theory,232,48
9790,Raj,23, He's right.,2,Big Bang Theory,12,2
9791,Howard,23," Yeah, wow.",2,Big Bang Theory,11,2
9792,Sheldon,23, It is remarkable.,2,Big Bang Theory,18,3
9793,Raj,23," So, who's up for a movie?",2,Big Bang Theory,26,6
9794,Howard,23," Good idea, what do you think? Ice Station Zebra or John Carpenter's The Thing?",2,Big Bang Theory,79,14
9795,Raj,23, I say double feature.,2,Big Bang Theory,22,4
9796,Leonard,23, Dinner's ready!,2,Big Bang Theory,16,2
9797,Sheldon,23, What are we having?,2,Big Bang Theory,20,4
9798,Leonard,23, Reconstituted Thai food.,2,Big Bang Theory,25,3
9799,Sheldon,23, Did you bring the dehydrated low-sodium soy sauce?,2,Big Bang Theory,51,8
9800,Leonard,23, Check.,2,Big Bang Theory,7,1
9801,Sheldon,23, Freeze-dried spicy mustard?,2,Big Bang Theory,28,3
9802,Leonard,23, Check.,2,Big Bang Theory,7,1
9803,Sheldon,23," Flash-frozen brown rice, not white?",2,Big Bang Theory,36,5
9804,Leonard,23," Uh, oh, sorry.",2,Big Bang Theory,15,3
9805,Sheldon,23, Not to worry. I hid it. Bazinga! You're in my spot.,2,Big Bang Theory,52,11
9806,Howard,23, There's no time for a crossbow. Find me an icicle.,2,Big Bang Theory,51,10
9807,Sheldon,23, Three months. This is gonna be great!,2,Big Bang Theory,38,7
9809,Leonard,1," Oh, thank God we're home.",3,Big Bang Theory,26,5
9810,Howard,1, I can't believe we spent three months in that frozen hell.,3,Big Bang Theory,59,11
9811,Raj,1, It was like a snowy nightmare from which there was no awakening.,3,Big Bang Theory,65,12
9812,Sheldon,1," I don't know what Arctic expedition you guys were on, but I thought it was a hoot and a half.",3,Big Bang Theory,94,20
9814,Sheldon,1," Oh, hi mom. No, I told you I'd call you when I got home, I'm not home yet.  Alright, I'm home. The Arctic expedition was a remarkable success, I'm all but certain there's a Nobel Prize in my future. Actually, I shouldn't say that. I'm entirely certain. No, mother, I could not feel your church group praying for my safety. The fact that I'm home safe is not proof that it worked, that logic is Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc. No, I'm not sassing you in Eskimo talk.",3,Big Bang Theory,461,88
9815,Leonard,1, I'm going to go let Penny know we're back.,3,Big Bang Theory,43,9
9816,Sheldon,1," Mother, I have to go. Yeah, love you. Bye.  Hello, old friend.  Daddy's home.",3,Big Bang Theory,78,14
9818,Penny,1," Leonard, you're back.",3,Big Bang Theory,22,3
9819,Leonard,1," Yeah, I just stopped by to say  Yeah, so, hi!",3,Big Bang Theory,46,10
9820,Penny,1, Hi! ,3,Big Bang Theory,5,1
9821,Howard,1," Dammit, I should have gone over and told her we were back.",3,Big Bang Theory,59,12
9822,Raj,1," Yeah, it was first come, first served.",3,Big Bang Theory,39,7
9824,Sheldon,1," I just want you both to know, when I publish my findings, I won't forget your contributions.",3,Big Bang Theory,93,17
9825,Howard,1, Great.,3,Big Bang Theory,7,1
9826,Raj,1, Thanks.,3,Big Bang Theory,8,1
9827,Sheldon,1," Of course, I can't mention you in my Nobel acceptance speech, but when I get round to writing my memoirs you can expect a very effusive footnote, and perhaps a signed copy.",3,Big Bang Theory,173,32
9828,Raj,1, We have to tell him.,3,Big Bang Theory,21,5
9829,Sheldon,1, Tell me what?,3,Big Bang Theory,14,3
9830,Howard,1, Damn his Vulcan hearing.,3,Big Bang Theory,25,4
9831,Sheldon,1," You fellows are planning a party for me, aren't you?",3,Big Bang Theory,53,10
9832,Howard,1," Okay, Sheldon, sit down.",3,Big Bang Theory,25,4
9833,Sheldon,1," If there's going to be a theme, I should let you know that I don't care for luau, toga or under the sea.",3,Big Bang Theory,105,23
9834,Howard,1," Yeah, we'll keep that in mind, look, we need to talk to you about something that happened at the North Pole.",3,Big Bang Theory,109,21
9835,Sheldon,1," If this is about the night the heat went out, there's nothing to be embarrassed about.",3,Big Bang Theory,87,16
9836,Raj,1, It's not about that.,3,Big Bang Theory,21,4
9837,Howard,1, And we agreed to never speak of it again.,3,Big Bang Theory,42,9
9838,Sheldon,1, So we slept together naked. It was only to keep our core body temperatures from plummeting.,3,Big Bang Theory,92,16
9839,Howard,1, He's speaking about it.,3,Big Bang Theory,24,4
9840,Raj,1," For me, it was a bonding moment.",3,Big Bang Theory,33,7
9841,Howard,1," Sheldon, you remember the first few weeks we were looking for magnetic monopoles and not finding anything and you were acting like an obnoxious, giant dictator?",3,Big Bang Theory,161,26
9842,Raj,1, I thought we were going to be gentle with him.,3,Big Bang Theory,47,10
9843,Howard,1," That's why I added the tator. And then when we found our first positive data, you were so happy.",3,Big Bang Theory,97,19
9844,Sheldon,1," Oh, yes. In the world of emoticons, I was colon, capital D.",3,Big Bang Theory,60,12
9845,Howard,1," Well, in actuality, what your equipment detected wasn't so much evidence of paradigm-shifting monopoles as it was static from the electric can opener we were turning on and off.",3,Big Bang Theory,178,29
9846,Raj,1," He just went colon, capital O.",3,Big Bang Theory,31,6
9847,Sheldon,1, You tampered with my experiment?,3,Big Bang Theory,33,5
9848,Howard,1, We had to.,3,Big Bang Theory,11,3
9849,Raj,1, It was the only way to keep you from being such a huge Dickensian. You see that? I added the ensian.,3,Big Bang Theory,101,21
9850,Sheldon,1, Did Leonard know about this? Leonard's my best friend in the world. Surely Leonard didn't know.,3,Big Bang Theory,96,16
9851,Howard,1," Actually, it was his idea.",3,Big Bang Theory,27,5
9852,Sheldon,1, Of course it was. The whole plan reeks of Leonard.,3,Big Bang Theory,51,10
9854,Penny,1, I missed you so much.,3,Big Bang Theory,22,5
9855,Leonard,1," I missed you, too.",3,Big Bang Theory,19,4
9856,Penny,1, I couldn't even think of anyone else while you were gone.,3,Big Bang Theory,58,11
9857,Leonard,1," Me, neither. Except for one night when the heat went out. Long story, it's don't ask.",3,Big Bang Theory,86,16
9858,Sheldon,1,  Leonard.  Leonard.  Leonard.,3,Big Bang Theory,30,3
9859,Leonard,1, Do not make a sound.,3,Big Bang Theory,21,5
9860,Sheldon,1, Whispering do not make a sound is a sound.,3,Big Bang Theory,43,9
9861,Leonard,1," Damn his Vulcan hearing. Not a good time, Sheldon.",3,Big Bang Theory,51,9
9862,Sheldon,1,  Penny.  Penny.  Penny.,3,Big Bang Theory,24,3
9863,Penny,1," Oh, this is ridiculous. What?",3,Big Bang Theory,30,5
9864,Sheldon,1," Hello, Penny. I realize you're currently at the mercy of your primitive biological urges, but as you have an entire lifetime of poor decisions ahead of you, may I interrupt this one?",3,Big Bang Theory,183,32
9865,Penny,1, It's great to see you too. Come on in.,3,Big Bang Theory,39,9
9866,Sheldon,1, Wolowitz has informed me of your grand deception. Do you have anything to say for yourself?,3,Big Bang Theory,92,16
9867,Leonard,1," Yes, I feel terrible about it. I will never forgive myself, I don't expect you to either, and I would really appreciate it if you would leave me with Penny for a session of self-criticism and repentance.",3,Big Bang Theory,204,37
9868,Penny,1," Okay, can someone please tell me what's going on here?",3,Big Bang Theory,55,10
9869,Sheldon,1," What's going on is I was led to believe I was making groundbreaking strides in science, when in fact, I was being fed false data at the hands of Wolowitz, Koothrappali and your furry little boy toy.",3,Big Bang Theory,199,37
9870,Penny,1, Is that true?,3,Big Bang Theory,14,3
9871,Leonard,1, It was the only way to make him happy.,3,Big Bang Theory,39,9
9872,Penny,1, Why did you have to make him happy?,3,Big Bang Theory,36,8
9873,Leonard,1," Because when he wasn't happy, we wanted to kill him. There was even a plan. We were going to throw his Kindle outside, and when he went to get it, lock the door and let him freeze to death.",3,Big Bang Theory,190,39
9874,Sheldon,1, That seems like a bit of an overreaction.,3,Big Bang Theory,42,8
9875,Leonard,1," No, the overreaction was the plan to tie your limbs to four different sled dog teams and yell mush. Look, we kept the original data. You can still publish the actual results.",3,Big Bang Theory,175,32
9876,Sheldon,1," Yes, but the actual results are unsuccessful and I've already sent an e-mail to everyone at the university explaining that I have confirmed string theory and forever changed man's understanding of the universe.",3,Big Bang Theory,211,33
9877,Leonard,1," Aw, see, yeah, you probably shouldn't have done that. So write another e-mail, set the record straight, it's no big deal.",3,Big Bang Theory,122,21
9878,Sheldon,1," You're right, Leonard, it's not a big deal. All you did was lie to me destroy my dream and humiliate me in front of the whole university. That, FYI, was sarcasm. I, in fact, believe it is a big deal",3,Big Bang Theory,199,40
9879,Penny,1," Oh, the poor thing.",3,Big Bang Theory,20,4
9880,Leonard,1," Yeah, I feel terrible.",3,Big Bang Theory,23,4
9881,Penny,1," Wait, wait. Aren't you going to go talk to him?",3,Big Bang Theory,48,10
9882,Leonard,1," What? Uh, he'll be fine, the guy's a trouper, come here.",3,Big Bang Theory,57,11
9883,Penny,1," No, you're right, you shouldn't talk to him. I will.",3,Big Bang Theory,53,10
9884,Leonard,1," Man, I cannot catch a break.",3,Big Bang Theory,29,6
9886,Penny,1, Hey. Do you want to talk?,3,Big Bang Theory,26,6
9887,Sheldon,1, About what? Being betrayed by my friends? Spending three months at the North Pole for nothing? And I didn't even get to go to Comic-Con!,3,Big Bang Theory,137,25
9888,Penny,1," Oh, hon Uh   Soft kitty, warm kitty",3,Big Bang Theory,36,7
9889,Sheldon,1, That's for when I'm sick. Sad is not sick.,3,Big Bang Theory,43,9
9890,Penny,1, Oh. Sorry. I don't know your sad song.,3,Big Bang Theory,39,8
9891,Sheldon,1, I don't have a sad song. I'm not a child.,3,Big Bang Theory,42,10
9892,Penny,1," Well, you know, I do understand what you're going through.",3,Big Bang Theory,59,10
9893,Sheldon,1, Really? Did you just have the Nobel Prize in waitressing stolen from you?,3,Big Bang Theory,74,13
9894,Penny,1," Well, no, but when I was a senior in high school, one of my friends heard I was going to be named head cheerleader. Oh, I was so excited. My mom even made me a celebration pie. Then they named stupid Valerie Mossbacher head cheerleader. Big ol' slutbag.",3,Big Bang Theory,254,48
9895,Sheldon,1, Are you saying that you think a celebration pie is even remotely comparable to a Nobel Prize?,3,Big Bang Theory,94,17
9896,Penny,1," Well, they're pretty tasty.",3,Big Bang Theory,28,4
9897,Sheldon,1," And on a different, but not unrelated topic, based on your current efforts to buoy my spirits, do you truly believe that you were ever fit to be a cheer leader?",3,Big Bang Theory,161,31
9898,Penny,1," Look, Sheldon, I just don't think that the guys and Leonard really meant to hurt you. You know? They just told an unfortunate lie to deal with a difficult situation. Okay, you know what it's like? Remember that scene in the new Star Trek movie when Kirk has to take over the ship, so he tells Spock all that stuff he knew wasn't true, like saying Spock didn't care his mom died?",3,Big Bang Theory,379,72
9899,Sheldon,1, I missed Comic-Con and the new Star Trek movie!,3,Big Bang Theory,48,9
9901,Raj,1, I like the new look.,3,Big Bang Theory,21,5
9902,Howard,1, Thanks. I call it the Clooney.,3,Big Bang Theory,31,6
9903,Raj,1," I call it the Mario and Luigi, but whatever. Hey, how's Sheldon doing?",3,Big Bang Theory,71,13
9904,Leonard,1," Well, he came out of his room this morning wearing his Darth Vader helmet and tried to choke me to death with the Force, so I'd say, a little better.",3,Big Bang Theory,150,30
9905,Howard,1," If I may abruptly change the subject, did you and Penny finally you know.",3,Big Bang Theory,74,14
9906,Leonard,1, Howard,3,Big Bang Theory,7,1
9907,Howard,1," Personally, I don't care, but my genitals wanted me to ask.",3,Big Bang Theory,60,11
9908,Leonard,1," Well, tell your genitals what I do with Penny is none of their business.",3,Big Bang Theory,73,14
9909,Howard,1, He says they didn't do it.,3,Big Bang Theory,27,6
9910,Leonard,1," Sheldon, over here.  ",3,Big Bang Theory,22,3
9911,Howard,1, What are you doing?,3,Big Bang Theory,20,4
9912,Raj,1, I feel bad for the guy.,3,Big Bang Theory,24,6
9913,Leonard,1," Sheldon, why are you sitting by yourself?",3,Big Bang Theory,42,7
9914,Sheldon,1," Because I am without friends. Like the proverbial cheese, I stand alone. Even while seated.",3,Big Bang Theory,92,15
9915,Leonard,1, Come on. We said we were sorry.,3,Big Bang Theory,32,7
9916,Sheldon,1, It's going to take more than I'm sorry and a store-bought apology pie from Penny to make up for what you've done to me.,3,Big Bang Theory,120,24
9918,Sheldon,1, You see? People have been pointing and laughing at me all morning.,3,Big Bang Theory,67,12
9920,Sheldon,1," All right, I've had enough. Attention, everyone. I' m Dr. Sheldon Cooper. As many of you in the physics department might know, my career trajectory has taken a minor detour.",3,Big Bang Theory,174,30
9922,Sheldon,1, My credibility may have been damaged,3,Big Bang Theory,37,6
9924,Sheldon,1," But I would like to remind you that in science, there's no such thing as failure. There once was a man who referred to his prediction of a cosmological constant as the single biggest blunder of his career. That man's name was, surprise, surprise, Albert Einstein.",3,Big Bang Theory,264,46
9926,Sheldon,1," Oh, you think you're so clever. Well, let me just tell you, while I do not currently have a scathing retort, you check your e-mail periodically for a doozy.",3,Big Bang Theory,157,29
9927,Leonard,1, So much for our friendship with Sheldon.,3,Big Bang Theory,41,7
9928,Raj,1," Well, we'll always have the night the heat went out.",3,Big Bang Theory,53,10
9930,Penny,1, Hi.,3,Big Bang Theory,4,1
9931,Leonard,1," Hey. Listen, since we got, you know, interrupted last night, I didn't have a chance to give you this.",3,Big Bang Theory,102,19
9932,Penny,1," Oh, Leonard, you shouldn't have. Oh, boy! What is it?",3,Big Bang Theory,54,10
9933,Leonard,1, It's a snowflake. From the North Pole.,3,Big Bang Theory,39,7
9934,Penny,1, Are you serious?,3,Big Bang Theory,17,3
9935,Leonard,1, Uh-huh. It'll last forever. I preserved it in a one percent solution of polyvinyl acetal resin.,3,Big Bang Theory,96,16
9936,Penny,1," Oh, my God. That's the most romantic thing anyone's ever said to me that I didn't understand.",3,Big Bang Theory,94,17
9937,Leonard,1," It's actually a pretty simple process. You see, cyanoacrylate are monomers which polymerize on  ",3,Big Bang Theory,97,14
9938,Howard,1," Red alert, Leonard. Sheldon ran away.",3,Big Bang Theory,38,6
9939,Leonard,1," Man, I can not catch a break.",3,Big Bang Theory,30,7
9940,Penny,1," So, how do you know he ran away?",3,Big Bang Theory,33,8
9941,Howard,1," Well, he's not answering his phone, he handed in his resignation at the university and he sent me a text that said, I'm running away.",3,Big Bang Theory,134,25
9942,Leonard,1," Okay, well, thanks for letting me know.",3,Big Bang Theory,40,7
9943,Penny,1," Well, Leonard, aren't you going to do something?",3,Big Bang Theory,49,8
9944,Leonard,1," Of course I'm going to do something. Uh, Howard, you check the comic book store. Raj, go to the Thai restaurant. I'll stay here with Penny in her apartment.  Oh, damn it. It's Sheldon's mother. A break cannot be caught. Hi, Mrs. Cooper. He is? Sheldon went home to Texas. Yeah, no, I know he resigned. Yes, I guess it kind of is our fault. No, no, no, you, you're right, someone needs to come talk to him. Don't worry, I'll take care of it. Yeah. All right. New plan. Howard, you and Raj go to Texas. I'll stay here with Penny in her apartment.",3,Big Bang Theory,545,105
9945,Penny,1," Well, you're not gonna go with them?",3,Big Bang Theory,37,7
9946,Leonard,1," Well, you know, I gave you the snowflake and we were kissing and Oh, come on, I don't want to go to Texas!",3,Big Bang Theory,107,23
9947,Howard,1," Oh, right, and I do? My people already crossed a desert once, we're done.",3,Big Bang Theory,74,14
9948,Leonard,1," Trust me, you'll be fine. See ya.",3,Big Bang Theory,34,7
9949,Penny,1," Well, wait a second, Leonard, come on, how can you not go? He's your best friend.",3,Big Bang Theory,82,16
9950,Leonard,1," Yeah, but I already saw him naked. Just come here.",3,Big Bang Theory,51,10
9951,Penny,1, No. I promise I will be here when you get back. Just go help Sheldon.,3,Big Bang Theory,70,15
9952,Leonard,1, Really?,3,Big Bang Theory,8,1
9953,Penny,1, Yeah. We waited a few months. We can wait a few more days.,3,Big Bang Theory,59,13
9954,Leonard,1, Maybe you can.,3,Big Bang Theory,15,3
9955,Penny,1, Go.,3,Big Bang Theory,4,1
9956,Raj,1," Boy, you cannot catch a break, can you?",3,Big Bang Theory,40,8
9959,Sheldon,1," Thanks, Mom.",3,Big Bang Theory,13,2
9961,Sheldon,1," Aw, Mom.",3,Big Bang Theory,9,2
9963,Sheldon,1, Fed.,3,Big Bang Theory,5,1
9965,Sheldon,1, Bread.,3,Big Bang Theory,7,1
9967,Sheldon,1, Grateful.,3,Big Bang Theory,10,1
9969,Sheldon,1, Plateful.,3,Big Bang Theory,10,1
9971,Sheldon,1, My objection was based on considerations other than difficulty.,3,Big Bang Theory,64,9
9973,Sheldon,1, Thank you for carving a smiley face in my grilled cheese sandwich.,3,Big Bang Theory,67,12
9975,Sheldon,1, They're not my friends.,3,Big Bang Theory,24,4
9977,Sheldon,1, That was different. They were threatened by my intelligence and too stupid to know that's why they hated me.,3,Big Bang Theory,109,19
9980,Leonard,1, I can't believe you bought a red cowboy hat.,3,Big Bang Theory,45,9
9981,Howard,1," Hello? I'm wearing a red turtleneck. Plus, it was the only boys' large they had.",3,Big Bang Theory,81,15
9982,Raj,1," I'm sorry, this does not look like Texas. Where's the tumbleweeds? Where's the saloons?",3,Big Bang Theory,88,14
9983,Leonard,1, Saloons?,3,Big Bang Theory,9,1
9984,Raj,1," Yeah, like in the movies I saw growing up in India. You know, uh, Four for Texas, Yellow Rose of Texas.",3,Big Bang Theory,104,21
9985,Howard,1, This neighbourhood is more Texas Chainsaw Massacre.,3,Big Bang Theory,52,7
9986,Raj,1, I was really hoping to see a cattle drive.,3,Big Bang Theory,43,9
9987,Leonard,1, What can I tell you? They probably have steaks on sale at that big-ass Costco over there.,3,Big Bang Theory,90,17
9989,Leonard,1, Will you please take that stupid hat off?,3,Big Bang Theory,42,8
9990,Howard,1," No, I want to blend in.",3,Big Bang Theory,24,6
9991,Raj,1, To what? Toy Story?,3,Big Bang Theory,20,4
9993,Howard,1," Howdy, ma'am.",3,Big Bang Theory,14,2
9995,Leonard,1, â€“ We took the red-eye.,3,Big Bang Theory,25,5
9997,Howard,1, Thank you kindly.,3,Big Bang Theory,18,3
9999,Leonard,1," Uh, no, thank you.",3,Big Bang Theory,19,4
10000,Howard,1," If y'all don't mind, I got a hankerin' for a Lone Star beer.",3,Big Bang Theory,61,13
10002,Howard,1, Sorry. I'll take a diet Yoo-Hoo if you have it.,3,Big Bang Theory,48,10
10005,Leonard,1," Uh, yes, ma'am.",3,Big Bang Theory,16,3
10007,Sheldon,1, What are they doing here?,3,Big Bang Theory,26,5
10008,Leonard,1, We came to apologize.,3,Big Bang Theory,22,4
10009,Howard,1, Again.,3,Big Bang Theory,7,1
10010,Leonard,1," And bring you home. So, why don't you pack up your stuff and we'll head back.",3,Big Bang Theory,78,16
10011,Leonard,1," No, this is my home now. Thanks to you, my career is over and I will spend the rest of my life here in Texas trying to teach evolution to creationists.",3,Big Bang Theory,152,31
10013,Sheldon,1," Evolution isn't an opinion, it's fact.",3,Big Bang Theory,39,6
10015,Sheldon,1, I forgive you. Let's go home.,3,Big Bang Theory,30,6
10018,Leonard,1, How about that? I finally caught a break.,3,Big Bang Theory,42,8
10019,Penny,1, Uh-huh.,3,Big Bang Theory,8,1
10020,Leonard,1, You know how they say when friends have sex it can get weird?,3,Big Bang Theory,62,13
10021,Penny,1, Sure.,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
10022,Leonard,1, Why does it have to get weird?,3,Big Bang Theory,31,7
10023,Penny,1, I don't know.,3,Big Bang Theory,14,3
10024,Leonard,1," I mean, we were friends, and now we're more than friends. We're whatever this is. But why label it, right? I mean, it is what it is and",3,Big Bang Theory,136,28
10025,Penny,1, Leonard?,3,Big Bang Theory,9,1
10026,Leonard,1, Yeah?,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
10027,Penny,1, It's weird.,3,Big Bang Theory,12,2
10028,Leonard,1, Totally.,3,Big Bang Theory,9,1
10030,Howard,2," Sheldon, you're wrong. Wolverine was not born with bone claws.",3,Big Bang Theory,63,10
10031,Sheldon,2," Howard, you know me to be a very smart man. Don't you think if I were wrong, I'd know it?",3,Big Bang Theory,90,20
10032,Howard,2," Okay, first of all",3,Big Bang Theory,19,4
10033,Raj,2," Give it up, dude, you're arguing with a crazy person.",3,Big Bang Theory,54,10
10034,Sheldon,2, I'm not crazy. My mother had me tested.,3,Big Bang Theory,40,8
10035,Leonard,2," Hey, guys.",3,Big Bang Theory,11,2
10036,Howard,2, What are you doing here?,3,Big Bang Theory,25,5
10037,Leonard,2, What do you mean? It's new comic book night.,3,Big Bang Theory,45,9
10038,Raj,2," Yeah, but since you and Penny finally hooked up, we thought you two would be having bouncy naked yum-yum night.",3,Big Bang Theory,112,20
10039,Leonard,2," There's more to life than sex, Raj.",3,Big Bang Theory,36,7
10040,Howard,2," Okay, who had Leonard flames out with Penny in less than 24 hoursâ€ù?",3,Big Bang Theory,70,13
10041,Sheldon,2, I did.,3,Big Bang Theory,7,2
10042,Leonard,2," Nothing flamed out. We don't have to have sex every night, you know.",3,Big Bang Theory,69,13
10043,Howard,2," You don't have to, but it's highly recommended.",3,Big Bang Theory,48,8
10044,Raj,2," Yeah, take advantage of that window of opportunity before it slams shut on your little dinky.",3,Big Bang Theory,94,16
10045,Leonard,2, It's not a matter of opportunity. We're getting to know each other. There's a learning curve.,3,Big Bang Theory,94,16
10046,Howard,2," What's there to learn? You get naked, do nasty things to each other, then somebody makes scrambled eggs and salami. Easy peasy.",3,Big Bang Theory,128,22
10047,Sheldon,2, Perhaps what Leonard is obliquely referring to is the occurrence of some sort of sexual dysfunction.,3,Big Bang Theory,101,16
10048,Raj,2," Okay, who had Leonard gets a floppy disk?",3,Big Bang Theory,42,8
10049,Sheldon,2," Oh, a clever, albeit obsolete, euphemism for insufficient blood flow to the male sex organ.",3,Big Bang Theory,92,15
10050,Leonard,2," Nothing like that happened, all right? The sex was just fine.",3,Big Bang Theory,62,11
10051,Raj,2," Just fine? Oh, dude, the fourth Harry Potter movie was just fine.",3,Big Bang Theory,66,12
10052,Leonard,2," I'm not saying it was bad, I'm just saying it wasn't great.",3,Big Bang Theory,60,12
10053,Howard,2," Okay, when you say â€œit wasn't great, do you mean for both of you? Because we can totally see it not being great for her. Am I right?",3,Big Bang Theory,135,28
10054,Raj,2," Oh, yeah.",3,Big Bang Theory,10,2
10055,Leonard,2," To tell you the truth, I think we were both a little, I don't know",3,Big Bang Theory,67,15
10056,Raj,2, Disappointed? Let down?,3,Big Bang Theory,24,3
10057,Howard,2, Ashamed? Horrified? Repulsed?,3,Big Bang Theory,30,3
10058,Leonard,2," All I know is, it wasn't the way I dreamed it would be.",3,Big Bang Theory,56,13
10059,Howard,2, Sex is never the way I dream it's gonna be.,3,Big Bang Theory,44,10
10060,Raj,2, That's because in your dreams you're a horse from the waist down.,3,Big Bang Theory,66,12
10062,Leonard,2," Sheldon, dinner's here.",3,Big Bang Theory,24,3
10063,Sheldon,2, Tandoori Palace?,3,Big Bang Theory,17,2
10064,Leonard,2," No, we went somewhere new.",3,Big Bang Theory,27,5
10065,Sheldon,2," You're good-naturedly ribbing me, aren't you?",3,Big Bang Theory,46,6
10066,Leonard,2," No, look, Mumbai Palace.",3,Big Bang Theory,25,4
10067,Sheldon,2, Why? Why would we change? We had a perfectly good palace. Tandoori Palace is our palace.,3,Big Bang Theory,89,16
10068,Leonard,2," Trust me, this will be just fine.",3,Big Bang Theory,34,7
10069,Howard,2, You are the authority on just fine.,3,Big Bang Theory,36,7
10070,Leonard,2, What's that supposed to mean?,3,Big Bang Theory,30,5
10071,Howard,2," Yeah, exactly. Not bad, but not great.",3,Big Bang Theory,39,7
10072,Penny,2, What are they talking about?,3,Big Bang Theory,29,5
10073,Leonard,2, I don't know,3,Big Bang Theory,13,3
10074,Sheldon,2, I know. As I'm sure you're aware,3,Big Bang Theory,33,7
10075,Leonard,2, Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.,3,Big Bang Theory,25,1
10076,Sheldon,2," If that's Morse code, that's terrible. As I was saying, you and Leonard had a disappointing sexual encounter. Earlier this evening, Leonard characterized it as just fine. So what you're seeing here is a continuation of the mocking that followed.",3,Big Bang Theory,246,40
10077,Penny,2," Okay, yeah, well, I'm just gonna go eat my dinner elsewhere. Maybe an airplane headed for a mountainside.",3,Big Bang Theory,106,18
10078,Leonard,2," Penny, wait. Aagh! What is wrong with you?",3,Big Bang Theory,43,8
10079,Sheldon,2, I sense I may have crossed some sort of line.,3,Big Bang Theory,46,10
10080,Raj,2," Yeah, you",3,Big Bang Theory,10,2
10081,Howard,2," Uh, no, no, no, don't tell him, let's see if he can figure it out.",3,Big Bang Theory,67,15
10082,Penny,2," Ugh, I am so embarrassed!",3,Big Bang Theory,26,5
10083,Leonard,2, Please don't be mad.,3,Big Bang Theory,21,4
10084,Penny,2, What did you tell them?,3,Big Bang Theory,24,5
10085,Leonard,2," Nothing bad, just that last night was fine.",3,Big Bang Theory,44,8
10086,Penny,2, Fine? You said it was fine?,3,Big Bang Theory,28,6
10087,Leonard,2," Yeah, it's a perfectly good word. You put it in front of wine or dining, and you've really got something. Okay, well, let me ask you this, how was last night for you?",3,Big Bang Theory,167,33
10088,Penny,2, It was okay.,3,Big Bang Theory,13,3
10089,Leonard,2, Okay?,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
10090,Penny,2," Yeah, it's a perfectly good word. I mean, you put it in front of dokay and you really got something. All right, look, let's not overreact, you know? For a lot of couples, it takes time to get to know each other's rhythms. Learn what the other person wants and likes.",3,Big Bang Theory,267,51
10091,Leonard,2," So, you've been through this before?",3,Big Bang Theory,37,6
10092,Penny,2, No.,3,Big Bang Theory,4,1
10093,Leonard,2, Okay-dokay.,3,Big Bang Theory,12,1
10094,Penny,2," You know, I think this is one of those things where talking about it is not going to make it better. Want a glass of wine?",3,Big Bang Theory,123,26
10095,Leonard,2, So much.,3,Big Bang Theory,9,2
10096,Penny,2," Okay. See, we should've done this last night, you know, have a little wine, take the edge off.",3,Big Bang Theory,95,18
10097,Leonard,2," Actually, ethyl alcohol inhibits electrical conduction in the nerve cells and stimulates reuptake receptors of inhibitory neurotransmitters like gamma-aminobutyric acid.",3,Big Bang Theory,170,20
10098,Penny,2," Don't talk, just drink.",3,Big Bang Theory,24,4
10099,Howard,2," No, you're misunderstanding. A shiksa goddess isn't an actual goddess and we don't pray to them, we prey on them.",3,Big Bang Theory,114,20
10100,Raj,2," Whatever, dude. The point is, Leonard's got one and you don't.",3,Big Bang Theory,63,11
10101,Sheldon,2," Is this it? It was inappropriate to discuss Leonard and Penny's sex life in front of Leonard and Penny.  Oh, good! Now I can eat.",3,Big Bang Theory,130,25
10102,Raj,2, What's that?,3,Big Bang Theory,13,2
10103,Howard,2, Sounds like a cricket.,3,Big Bang Theory,23,4
10104,Sheldon,2," Hang on. Based on the number of chirps per minute and the ambient temperature in this room, it is a snowy tree cricket.",3,Big Bang Theory,120,23
10105,Howard,2," Oh, give me a frickin' break. How could you possibly know that?",3,Big Bang Theory,64,12
10106,Sheldon,2," In 1890, Emile Dolbear determined that there was a fixed relationship between the number of chirps per minute of the snowy tree cricket and the ambient temperature. A precise relationship that is not present with ordinary field crickets.",3,Big Bang Theory,238,38
10107,Raj,2, How do you know what the exact temperature of the room is?,3,Big Bang Theory,59,12
10108,Sheldon,2," Under the terms of my roommate agreement with Leonard, I've had unilateral control of the thermostat ever since the sweaty night of '06.",3,Big Bang Theory,137,23
10109,Howard,2," Okay, you were right about Wolverine and bone claws, but you're wrong about the cricket.",3,Big Bang Theory,89,15
10110,Sheldon,2," Howard, don't embarrass yourself, the science chirps for itself. Humorous word play.",3,Big Bang Theory,85,12
10111,Howard,2," No, no, not this time. I know insects, my friend, I spent many childhood years capturing them with nets, putting them in glass jars, sticking pins through them, mounting them on corrugated cardboard with Dymo labels underneath, identifying the genus and species. In Latin.",3,Big Bang Theory,273,44
10112,Raj,2," Oh, dude, you are never getting a shiksa goddess.",3,Big Bang Theory,50,9
10113,Sheldon,2, That is a snowy tree cricket. Oecanthus fultoni. I was done with Latin by fifth grade.,3,Big Bang Theory,87,16
10114,Howard,2," Okay, okay, tell you what. I am willing to bet anything that's an ordinary field cricket.",3,Big Bang Theory,90,16
10115,Sheldon,2, I can't take your money.,3,Big Bang Theory,25,5
10116,Howard,2," What's the matter, you chicken?",3,Big Bang Theory,32,5
10117,Sheldon,2," I've always found that an inappropriate slur. Chickens are not, by nature, at all timid. In fact, when I was young, my neighbour's chicken got loose and chased me up the big elm tree in front of our house.",3,Big Bang Theory,206,39
10118,Raj,2, Chickens can't climb trees,3,Big Bang Theory,27,4
10119,Sheldon,2, Thank God.,3,Big Bang Theory,11,2
10120,Howard,2," Okay, I believe a chicken made you his bitch. But the cricket thing, I don't buy. Bet me.",3,Big Bang Theory,90,18
10121,Sheldon,2, Fair enough. What stake do you propose?,3,Big Bang Theory,40,7
10122,Howard,2," I will put up my Fantastic Four number 48, first appearance of Silver Surfer against your Flash 123, the classic Flash of two worlds issue.",3,Big Bang Theory,140,25
10123,Sheldon,2," All right, you have a wager.",3,Big Bang Theory,29,6
10124,Howard,2, Hmm.,3,Big Bang Theory,5,1
10125,Raj,2," Great. Now how are you going to settle it, hmm? There is no way to determine the species of the cricket without examining it.",3,Big Bang Theory,126,24
10126,Raj,2, I wonder what the non-pathetic people are doing tonight.,3,Big Bang Theory,57,9
10128,Leonard,2, More wine?,3,Big Bang Theory,11,2
10129,Penny,2, Hit me.,3,Big Bang Theory,8,2
10131,Sheldon,2, I don't see anything.,3,Big Bang Theory,22,4
10132,Howard,2, Shh!,3,Big Bang Theory,5,1
10133,Raj,2, Hallway. ,3,Big Bang Theory,10,1
10134,Sheldon,2, One at a time.  What was that?,3,Big Bang Theory,31,7
10135,Raj,2," My stomach. Indian food doesn't agree with me. Ironic, isn't it?",3,Big Bang Theory,65,11
10136,Howard,2, Shh! Elevator shaft.,3,Big Bang Theory,21,3
10137,Sheldon,2, Help me open it.,3,Big Bang Theory,17,4
10138,Howard,2, Are you crazy? We can't go down an empty elevator shaft.,3,Big Bang Theory,57,11
10139,Sheldon,2," Fine, if you don't want to proceed, then you forfeit the bet, and I'll take possession of your Fantastic Four.",3,Big Bang Theory,111,20
10140,Howard,2, Let's open her up.,3,Big Bang Theory,19,4
10141,Sheldon,2, Are you bothered that I can so easily manipulate you?,3,Big Bang Theory,54,10
10142,Howard,2," Don't push me, Sheldon. I may be small, but I took kung fu when I was 13, and I remember a good deal of it.",3,Big Bang Theory,108,25
10143,Sheldon,2," Oh, really? Well, I grew up with an older brother and a very contentious twin sister and I believe I could easily best you in any physical confrontation, be it noogies, swirlies or the classic why are you hitting yourself?",3,Big Bang Theory,223,40
10144,Raj,2," Ooh, big talk from a man who was once treed by a chicken.",3,Big Bang Theory,58,13
10146,Leonard,2, What are we drinking now?,3,Big Bang Theory,26,5
10147,Penny,2, Peppermint schnapps.,3,Big Bang Theory,21,2
10148,Leonard,2, Why would you buy peppermint schnapps?,3,Big Bang Theory,39,6
10149,Penny,2," Because I like peppermint, and it's fun to say schnapps. Hey, Leonard?",3,Big Bang Theory,71,12
10150,Leonard,2, What?,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
10151,Penny,2, Schnapps.,3,Big Bang Theory,10,1
10152,Leonard,2," Schnapps. You're right, that is fun.",3,Big Bang Theory,37,6
10154,Raj,2, Be careful.,3,Big Bang Theory,12,2
10155,Sheldon,2," If I were not being careful, your telling me to be careful would not make me careful.",3,Big Bang Theory,86,17
10156,Raj,2, Stairwell.,3,Big Bang Theory,11,1
10157,Sheldon,2," Uh-oh, flashlight went out. I need some batteries. Fellas? Hello? It's really dark down here.",3,Big Bang Theory,94,15
10159,Penny,2," Oh, sweetie. You really can't hold your liquor, can you?",3,Big Bang Theory,57,10
10160,Leonard,2," I'm okay. Just a little mouthwash, and then I'm gonna rock your world.  Are you okay? ",3,Big Bang Theory,87,16
10162,Raj,2," Ugh, Toby, what did you do in a past life to be so disgusting now?",3,Big Bang Theory,67,15
10163,Sheldon,2, His name isn't Toby. Toby is an absurd name for a cricket.,3,Big Bang Theory,59,12
10164,Raj,2, What would you name him?,3,Big Bang Theory,25,5
10165,Sheldon,2," An appropriate cricket name. For example, Jiminy.",3,Big Bang Theory,50,7
10166,Howard,2," All right, Sheldon, here we go, Kleingast's Field Guide to North American Insects. Hey, Toby. Right here, see it? The common field cricket, aka Gryllus assimilis, which is Latin for suck it, you lose.",3,Big Bang Theory,201,34
10167,Sheldon,2," Hang on. VoilÃ, the snowy tree cricket, aka Oecanthus fultoni, which is Latin for I'll suck nothing. Of course I'm joking because the Latin for that is nihil exsorbibo.",3,Big Bang Theory,169,29
10168,Howard,2," That is not Toby, this is Toby. Raj, what do you think?",3,Big Bang Theory,56,12
10169,Raj,2," Oh, I really don't care anymore",3,Big Bang Theory,32,6
10170,Leonard,2," God, I had the most horrible night.",3,Big Bang Theory,36,7
10171,Raj,2, What happened?,3,Big Bang Theory,15,2
10172,Sheldon,2, Obviously another carnal fiasco with the shiksi goddess.,3,Big Bang Theory,57,8
10173,Howard,2, Shiksa. Shik-sa.,3,Big Bang Theory,17,2
10174,Sheldon,2," Forgive me. Yiddish was not spoken in east Texas. And if it was, it wasn't spoken for long.",3,Big Bang Theory,92,18
10175,Howard,2," Yeah, fine, whatever. The point is, you're wrong again.",3,Big Bang Theory,56,9
10176,Sheldon,2, We haven't established that I'm wrong once.,3,Big Bang Theory,44,7
10177,Howard,2," All right. Tell you what, let's go down to the Entomology Department and let Professor",3,Big Bang Theory,87,15
10178,Sheldon,2," He's a snowy tree cricket, and his name is Jiminy.  ",3,Big Bang Theory,53,10
10179,Leonard,2, I bet I could throw a rock in this room and come up with three better friends.,3,Big Bang Theory,79,17
10181,Raj,2, Holy crap. It's like Silence of the Lambs down here.  Don't do that!,3,Big Bang Theory,69,13
10182,Howard,2, You're such a girl. They're just bugs.,3,Big Bang Theory,39,7
10183,Raj,2," Yeah, well, I don't like bugs, okay? They freak me out.",3,Big Bang Theory,56,11
10184,Sheldon,2, Interesting. You're afraid of insects and women. Ladybugs must render you catatonic. It was a joke. I made it to lessen your discomfort. You're welcome,3,Big Bang Theory,152,25
10186,Sheldon,2," Excuse me, are you Professor Crawley?",3,Big Bang Theory,38,6
10188,Sheldon,2, I'm Dr. Cooper from the Physics Department.,3,Big Bang Theory,44,7
10190,Sheldon,2, I'm sorry?,3,Big Bang Theory,11,2
10192,Howard,2," No, you don't understand. We just want to ask you a question.",3,Big Bang Theory,62,12
10194,Raj,2, Ask rhetorical questions that make people uncomfortable?,3,Big Bang Theory,57,7
10196,Raj,2, I'm from New Delhi. Maybe you should find another entomologist.,3,Big Bang Theory,64,10
10197,Sheldon,2," No, no. We're here, let's settle this. Professor, can you identify our cricket?",3,Big Bang Theory,80,13
10199,Howard,2," Well, could you look at Toby?",3,Big Bang Theory,30,6
10201,Sheldon,2, Told you.,3,Big Bang Theory,10,2
10203,Howard,2, Yes!,3,Big Bang Theory,5,1
10204,Sheldon,2," No, no, wait. Dr. Crawley, are you sure?",3,Big Bang Theory,41,8
10206,Sheldon,2," Cruel as that may be, that is not in itself a credential.",3,Big Bang Theory,58,12
10208,Sheldon,2," Well, apparently, I was wrong. Congratulations.",3,Big Bang Theory,48,6
10209,Raj,2, Enjoy Oxnard. I'm sure your daughter's looking forward to having you.,3,Big Bang Theory,70,11
10211,Penny,2," Oh, hey, Sheldon. What you got there? A new comic book?",3,Big Bang Theory,56,11
10212,Sheldon,2, Old comic book. I just retrieved it from my safe deposit box.,3,Big Bang Theory,62,12
10213,Penny,2, What do you have a safe deposit box for?,3,Big Bang Theory,41,9
10214,Sheldon,2, Old comic books. I lost this to Wolowitz in an ill-considered cricket wager.,3,Big Bang Theory,77,13
10215,Penny,2," What, do they have Wii cricket now? That can't be very popular.",3,Big Bang Theory,64,12
10216,Sheldon,2," Penny, I'd rather not talk about it.",3,Big Bang Theory,37,7
10217,Penny,2," Well, if it makes you feel any better, I'm not feeling so hot either.",3,Big Bang Theory,70,14
10218,Sheldon,2, Why would that make me feel better?,3,Big Bang Theory,36,7
10219,Penny,2," I don't know, empathy? Anyway, I'm just saying that you're feeling upset about something with Howard, and I'm upset about something with Leonard.",3,Big Bang Theory,146,23
10220,Sheldon,2," Yes, yes, the disappointing sex. That's an inexact parallel. You and Leonard can always return to being friends, whereas I can never return to a state in which Wolowitz has not bested me like Mrs. Riley's chicken.",3,Big Bang Theory,214,37
10221,Penny,2, What's Mrs. Riley's chicken?,3,Big Bang Theory,29,4
10222,Sheldon,2, A chicken that was owned by Mrs. Riley.,3,Big Bang Theory,40,8
10223,Penny,2," Okay, forget the chicken.",3,Big Bang Theory,26,4
10224,Sheldon,2," Well, I wish I could.",3,Big Bang Theory,22,5
10225,Penny,2," No, no. You may be right about me and Leonard.",3,Big Bang Theory,47,10
10226,Sheldon,2, Of course I'm right What are the odds I'd be wrong twice in one week?,3,Big Bang Theory,70,15
10227,Penny,2," No, I mean, we can always go back to being friends.",3,Big Bang Theory,52,11
10228,Sheldon,2, I just said that. This conversation has started to circle. Meeting adjourned.,3,Big Bang Theory,78,12
10230,Sheldon,2, Hello.,3,Big Bang Theory,7,1
10231,Leonard,2, Hey. What's going on?,3,Big Bang Theory,22,4
10232,Sheldon,2," Oh, you'd like to catch up on the events of the day. All right. Well, there was a half-hour wait at the bank to get into my safe deposit box, I was forced to talk to Penny about your sexual problems, and, oh, yes, in a moment filled with biblical resonance, pride wenteth before my fall, causing my Flash 123 to goeth to Wolowitz.",3,Big Bang Theory,331,64
10233,Leonard,2, Wait a minute. You talked to Penny about our sex life?,3,Big Bang Theory,55,11
10234,Sheldon,2," Leonard, it astonishes me how you continually fixate on the trivial. I lost a bet to Wolowitz.",3,Big Bang Theory,95,17
10235,Leonard,2," Right, right. You're saying you talked to Penny?",3,Big Bang Theory,49,8
10236,Sheldon,2, Yes.,3,Big Bang Theory,5,1
10237,Leonard,2, Interesting.,3,Big Bang Theory,13,1
10238,Sheldon,2, Hardly.,3,Big Bang Theory,8,1
10239,Leonard,2, Excuse me.,3,Big Bang Theory,11,2
10240,Sheldon,2, Have I crossed some sort of line again?,3,Big Bang Theory,40,8
10241,Leonard,2, Little bit. ,3,Big Bang Theory,13,2
10242,Sheldon,2," Hmm. Oh, who cares?",3,Big Bang Theory,20,4
10244,Penny,2," Oh, hey.",3,Big Bang Theory,9,2
10245,Leonard,2," Hey. Uh, what did Sheldon say to you?",3,Big Bang Theory,38,8
10246,Penny,2, Not a lot. Just that we always have the option of going back to being friends.,3,Big Bang Theory,79,16
10247,Leonard,2, Is that what you want?,3,Big Bang Theory,23,5
10248,Penny,2," I don't know. I mean, you have to admit things seemed simpler when we were just friends.",3,Big Bang Theory,89,17
10249,Leonard,2, I guess.,3,Big Bang Theory,9,2
10250,Penny,2, It would take the pressure off.,3,Big Bang Theory,32,6
10251,Leonard,2," It would, wouldn't it?",3,Big Bang Theory,23,4
10252,Penny,2," So, we'll just be friends.",3,Big Bang Theory,27,5
10253,Leonard,2," Good, good.",3,Big Bang Theory,12,2
10254,Penny,2, Come here. ,3,Big Bang Theory,12,2
10255,Leonard,2, Okay-dokay,3,Big Bang Theory,11,1
10257,Penny,3," Morning, Sheldon. Come dance with me.",3,Big Bang Theory,38,6
10258,Sheldon,3, No.,3,Big Bang Theory,4,1
10259,Penny,3, Why not?,3,Big Bang Theory,9,2
10260,Sheldon,3," Penny, while I subscribe to the many worlds theory which posits the existence of an infinite number of Sheldons in an infinite number of universes, I assure you that in none of them am I dancing.",3,Big Bang Theory,196,36
10261,Penny,3, Are you fun in any of them?,3,Big Bang Theory,28,7
10262,Sheldon,3, The math would suggest that in a few I'm a clown made of candy. But I don't dance.,3,Big Bang Theory,83,18
10263,Penny,3," All right, want some French toast?",3,Big Bang Theory,35,6
10264,Sheldon,3, It's Oatmeal Day.,3,Big Bang Theory,18,3
10265,Penny,3," Tell you what, next French Toast Day, I will make you oatmeal.",3,Big Bang Theory,63,12
10266,Sheldon,3," Dear Lord, are you still going to be here on French Toast Day?",3,Big Bang Theory,63,13
10267,Leonard,3, Morning.,3,Big Bang Theory,9,1
10268,Sheldon,3," Look, Leonard, Penny made French toast.",3,Big Bang Theory,40,6
10269,Leonard,3, Sorry. I haven't given her your schedule yet.,3,Big Bang Theory,46,8
10270,Sheldon,3," It's an iCal download, she can put it right in her phone. And I thought we agreed that you'd have your conjugal visits in her apartment.",3,Big Bang Theory,137,26
10271,Leonard,3," We did, but there were extenuating circumstances.",3,Big Bang Theory,50,7
10272,Sheldon,3, I see. Did her abysmal housekeeping skills finally trump her perkiness?,3,Big Bang Theory,72,11
10273,Leonard,3," No, her bed kind of broke.",3,Big Bang Theory,27,6
10274,Sheldon,3, That doesn't seem likely. Her bed's of sturdy construction. Even the addition,3,Big Bang Theory,78,12
10275,Penny,3, A homunculus?,3,Big Bang Theory,14,2
10276,Leonard,3, Perfectly formed miniature human being.,3,Big Bang Theory,40,5
10277,Penny,3," Oh, you're my little homunculus.",3,Big Bang Theory,33,5
10278,Leonard,3, Don't do that.,3,Big Bang Theory,15,3
10279,Penny,3," Sorry. Okay, who wants syrup and who wants cinnamon sugar?",3,Big Bang Theory,59,10
10280,Sheldon,3, I want oatmeal.,3,Big Bang Theory,16,3
10281,Penny,3," Yes, well, I want a boyfriend whose roommate isn't a giant pain in the ass.",3,Big Bang Theory,76,15
10282,Sheldon,3," I'm sure that will happen soon enough. But in the meantime, I still want oatmeal.",3,Big Bang Theory,82,15
10283,Penny,3," You know what, I give up. He's impossible.",3,Big Bang Theory,43,8
10284,Sheldon,3," I can't be impossible. I exist. I believe what you meant to say is, â€œI give up, he's improbable.â€ù",3,Big Bang Theory,102,19
10285,Leonard,3," Sheldon, you really need to find a better way of dealing with Penny.",3,Big Bang Theory,69,13
10286,Sheldon,3," What am I supposed to do, eat French toast on a Monday? Now, that would be impossible.",3,Big Bang Theory,87,17
10287,Leonard,3," I'm just saying, you can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.",3,Big Bang Theory,72,13
10288,Sheldon,3, You can catch even more flies with manure. What's your point?,3,Big Bang Theory,62,11
10289,Leonard,3, It's a ,3,Big Bang Theory,8,2
10290,Sheldon,3," Boy, that does smell good. Too bad it's Monday.",3,Big Bang Theory,48,9
10292,Penny,3," Okay, so Kim the night manager went on maternity leave, and her husband's name is Sandy, right? So get this, her replacement is a woman named Sandy whose husband's name is Kim.",3,Big Bang Theory,177,32
10293,Leonard,3, Wow!,3,Big Bang Theory,5,1
10294,Penny,3, I know. What are the odds?,3,Big Bang Theory,27,6
10295,Sheldon,3," Easily calculable, we begin by identifying the set of married couples with unisex names. We then eliminate those unqualified for restaurant work, the aged, the imprisoned and the limbless, for example. Next we look at",3,Big Bang Theory,218,35
10296,Leonard,3," Sheldon! it's an amazing coincidence, can we leave it at that?",3,Big Bang Theory,63,11
10297,Sheldon,3," I'm sorry. Ooh, Penny, it's as if the Cheesecake Factory is run by witches.",3,Big Bang Theory,76,14
10298,Penny,3," Ooh, Sheldon, it's as if you don't think I'll punch you.",3,Big Bang Theory,57,11
10299,Leonard,3," Come on, you guys, let it go.",3,Big Bang Theory,30,7
10300,Penny,3," Fine, whatever. Are you finished?",3,Big Bang Theory,34,5
10301,Sheldon,3," Well, thank you. How thoughtful. Would you like a chocolate",3,Big Bang Theory,60,10
10302,Penny,3," Um, yeah, sure, thanks.",3,Big Bang Theory,24,4
10303,Leonard,3, What was that?,3,Big Bang Theory,15,3
10304,Sheldon,3, You said be nice to Penny. I believe offering chocolate to someone falls within the definition of nice.,3,Big Bang Theory,104,18
10305,Leonard,3," It does. But in my experience, you don't.",3,Big Bang Theory,42,8
10306,Sheldon,3," There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.",3,Big Bang Theory,91,16
10307,Leonard,3," Yeah, yeah, now that's you, obnoxious and insufferable.",3,Big Bang Theory,56,8
10308,Howard,3," What's going on, day dwellers?",3,Big Bang Theory,31,5
10309,Penny,3," Oh, man, did the Kiss Army repeal don't ask, don't tell?",3,Big Bang Theory,57,11
10310,Howard,3, No. Raj and I are going a goth club in Hollywood to hang with the night people. Anybody want to come along?,3,Big Bang Theory,108,22
10311,Penny,3," Oh, wow, you're actually going out like that?",3,Big Bang Theory,46,8
10312,Howard,3," No, no. I'm going out like this. ",3,Big Bang Theory,34,7
10313,Leonard,3," Howard, what did you do?",3,Big Bang Theory,25,5
10314,Howard,3," They're called tattoo sleeves. Look. I bought them online, Raj got a set, too. Fantastic, right? Put them on, have hot sex with some freaky girl with her business pierced, take them off, and I can still be buried in a Jewish cemetery.",3,Big Bang Theory,235,43
10315,Sheldon,3," You know, I've always wanted to go to a goth nighclub.",3,Big Bang Theory,55,11
10316,Howard,3, Really?,3,Big Bang Theory,8,1
10317,Sheldon,3," Bazinga! None of you ever see my practical jokes coming, do you?",3,Big Bang Theory,65,12
10318,Howard,3," Okay, how about you two? Look, I've got some extra tat sleeves.",3,Big Bang Theory,64,12
10319,Leonard,3, Why are you carrying extras?,3,Big Bang Theory,29,5
10320,Howard,3," Well, In case I snag one on someone's nipple ring.",3,Big Bang Theory,51,10
10321,Penny,3," Uh, yeah, I think we'll pass.",3,Big Bang Theory,30,6
10322,Howard,3," Oh, is the missus speaking for the couple now?",3,Big Bang Theory,47,9
10323,Leonard,3," In this case, you bet she is.",3,Big Bang Theory,30,7
10324,Howard,3," Yes, she's pushy and yes, he's whipped, but that's not the expression. Come on, I want to stop at Walgreens and pick up some more eyeliner.",3,Big Bang Theory,140,26
10325,Leonard,3, They're gonna get beaten up at that club.,3,Big Bang Theory,42,8
10326,Penny,3," They're gonna get beaten up at Walgreens. Oh, sorry, Sheldon, I almost sat in your spot.",3,Big Bang Theory,89,16
10327,Sheldon,3, Did you? I didn't notice. Have a chocolate.,3,Big Bang Theory,44,8
10328,Penny,3, Thank you.,3,Big Bang Theory,11,2
10330,Raj,3, I think we're fitting in quite nicely.,3,Big Bang Theory,39,7
10331,Howard,3, It'd help if you weren't drinking light beer.,3,Big Bang Theory,46,8
10332,Raj,3," Oh, what's so gothic about vodka and cranberry juice?",3,Big Bang Theory,54,9
10333,Howard,3," Hello, it looks like blood. Did you even read the Wiki How link I sent you on being goth?",3,Big Bang Theory,90,19
10334,Raj,3," No, I'm behind on my wiki-reading I'm kind of on a John Grisham kick right now.",3,Big Bang Theory,80,16
10335,Howard,3, What?,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
10336,Raj,3," Well, I finished reading The Pelican Brief and loved it so much, I dived right into The Client. He was a lawyer himself so his novels are accurate as well as entertaining.",3,Big Bang Theory,172,32
10337,Howard,3," Just remember we are lost boys, children of the night.",3,Big Bang Theory,55,10
10338,Raj,3," Great. Lost boys, children of the night. Got it. Can you pass the Chex mix, please. Thank you. We are lost boys.",3,Big Bang Theory,113,22
10340,Howard,3, I'm actually much morelost than he is.,3,Big Bang Theory,39,7
10342,Howard,3, Thanks. Can we buy you ladies a drink?,3,Big Bang Theory,39,8
10344,Raj,3," Light beers? Well, Wiki-how about that?",3,Big Bang Theory,40,6
10346,Howard,3, I'm Howard.,3,Big Bang Theory,12,2
10347,Raj,3, Raj.,3,Big Bang Theory,5,1
10349,Howard,3," Nice to meet you, Bethany.",3,Big Bang Theory,27,5
10350,Raj,3," Yes, very nice.",3,Big Bang Theory,16,3
10353,Raj,3, Do either of you ladies enjoy the novels of John Grisham?,3,Big Bang Theory,58,11
10355,Penny,3, What's this cartoon called again?,3,Big Bang Theory,34,5
10356,Sheldon,3," And it's not a cartoon, it's anime.",3,Big Bang Theory,36,7
10357,Penny,3," Anime. You know, I knew a girl in high school named Anna May. Anna May Fletcher. She was born with one nostril. Then she had this bad nose job and basically wound up with three.",3,Big Bang Theory,178,35
10358,Sheldon,3, You're here a lot now.,3,Big Bang Theory,23,5
10359,Penny,3," Oh, am I talking too much? I'm sorry. Zip.",3,Big Bang Theory,43,9
10360,Sheldon,3, Thank you. Chocolate?,3,Big Bang Theory,22,3
10361,Penny,3," Yes please.  Oh. Hey, Kim. Yeah, I  You know what, hold on, let me take this in the hall.  You'll never guess who they got to replace you at work",3,Big Bang Theory,146,30
10362,Leonard,3," Okay, I know what you're doing.",3,Big Bang Theory,32,6
10363,Sheldon,3, Really?,3,Big Bang Theory,8,1
10364,Leonard,3," Yes, you're using chocolates as positive reinforcement for what you consider correct behaviour.",3,Big Bang Theory,96,13
10365,Sheldon,3, Very good. Chocolate?,3,Big Bang Theory,22,3
10366,Leonard,3," No, I don't want any chocolate! Sheldon, you can't train my girlfriend like a lab rat.",3,Big Bang Theory,87,16
10367,Sheldon,3," Actually, it turns out I can.",3,Big Bang Theory,30,6
10368,Leonard,3," Well, you shouldn't.",3,Big Bang Theory,21,3
10369,Sheldon,3," There's just no pleasing you, is there, Leonard? You weren't happy with my previous approach to dealing with her, so I decided to employ operant conditioning techniques, building on the work of Thorndike and B.F. Skinner. By this time next week, I believe I can have her jumping out of a pool, balancing a beach ball on her nose.",3,Big Bang Theory,330,59
10370,Leonard,3," No, this has to stop now.",3,Big Bang Theory,26,6
10371,Sheldon,3," I'm not suggesting we really make her jump out of a pool. I thought the â€œbazingaâ€ù was implied. I'm just tweaking her personality, sanding off the rough edges if you will.",3,Big Bang Theory,175,31
10372,Leonard,3," No, you're not sanding Penny.",3,Big Bang Theory,30,5
10373,Sheldon,3," Are you saying that I'm forbidden from applying a harmless, scientifically valid protocol that will make our lives better?",3,Big Bang Theory,123,19
10374,Leonard,3," Yes, you're forbidden.",3,Big Bang Theory,23,3
10375,Sheldon,3, Bad Leonard.,3,Big Bang Theory,13,2
10378,Howard,3," Oh, you know, goth stuff. Goth magazines, goth music.",3,Big Bang Theory,54,9
10379,Raj,3, Goth food.,3,Big Bang Theory,11,2
10381,Raj,3, Uh blackened salmon?,3,Big Bang Theory,21,3
10383,Raj,3," Oh, we're scientists.",3,Big Bang Theory,22,3
10384,Howard,3," Yeah, you know, the dark sciences.",3,Big Bang Theory,35,6
10386,Raj,3," Well, I am an astrophysicist and a lot of that takes place at night. When there are vampires and miscellaneous undead out and about.",3,Big Bang Theory,133,24
10387,Howard,3, Oy vay.,3,Big Bang Theory,8,2
10388,Raj,3, That sounds really cool.,3,Big Bang Theory,25,4
10389,Howard,3," Does it? Okay, if you like space stuff, I design components for the international space station. Which is in space. Where, as I'm sure you know, no one can hear you scream.",3,Big Bang Theory,173,32
10390,Raj,3, So what do you gals do?,3,Big Bang Theory,24,6
10392,Howard,3, Really? How about that? I've been to the Gap.,3,Big Bang Theory,46,9
10393,Raj,3," Yeah, I've been there as well. I like your tee-shirts with the little pocket.",3,Big Bang Theory,78,14
10396,Howard,3, Okay.,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
10397,Raj,3," Sure, we like fun.",3,Big Bang Theory,19,4
10398,Howard,3, We are fun people.,3,Big Bang Theory,19,4
10399,Raj,3, Dark and fun.,3,Big Bang Theory,14,3
10401,Howard,3, Did you bring the black condoms?,3,Big Bang Theory,33,6
10402,Raj,3, In my fanny pack.,3,Big Bang Theory,18,4
10403,Howard,3, Let's go.,3,Big Bang Theory,10,2
10405,Raj,3, Are you happy now?,3,Big Bang Theory,19,4
10406,Howard,3, Not particularly.,3,Big Bang Theory,18,2
10408,Penny,3," Oh' my God, she didn't!",3,Big Bang Theory,24,5
10409,Leonard,3, What could she possibly be talking about for so long?,3,Big Bang Theory,54,10
10410,Sheldon,3," Obviously, waitressing at the Cheesecake Factory is a complex socioeconomic activity, that requires a great deal of analysis and planning. Bazinga! You know, using positive reinforcement techniques, I could train that behaviour out of her in a week.",3,Big Bang Theory,250,38
10411,Leonard,3, No.,3,Big Bang Theory,4,1
10412,Sheldon,3," If you let me use negative reinforcement, I can get it done before we go to bed.",3,Big Bang Theory,81,17
10413,Leonard,3, You're not squirting her in the face with water.,3,Big Bang Theory,49,9
10414,Sheldon,3," No, of course not. We're talking very mild electric shocks. No tissue damage whatsoever.",3,Big Bang Theory,89,14
10415,Leonard,3, Forget it.,3,Big Bang Theory,11,2
10416,Sheldon,3," Oh, come on, you can't tell me that you're not intrigued about the possibility of building a better girlfriend.",3,Big Bang Theory,112,19
10417,Leonard,3," I'm not. And Penny's qualities, both good and bad, are what make her who she is.",3,Big Bang Theory,81,16
10418,Sheldon,3," You mean, like that high-pitched, irritating laugh?",3,Big Bang Theory,52,7
10419,Leonard,3, Yes.,3,Big Bang Theory,5,1
10420,Leonard,3, You're not changing how Penny laughs.,3,Big Bang Theory,38,6
10421,Sheldon,3," No, that would be incongruous, I was going to lower the whole voice to a more pleasing register.",3,Big Bang Theory,97,18
10422,Penny,3," Uh, sorry guys, that girl is  freaky!",3,Big Bang Theory,38,7
10423,Sheldon,3, Come again?,3,Big Bang Theory,12,2
10424,Penny,3, Freaky.,3,Big Bang Theory,8,1
10425,Sheldon,3, Freaky?,3,Big Bang Theory,8,1
10426,Penny,3," Yeah, freaky.",3,Big Bang Theory,14,2
10427,Sheldon,3, Have a chocolate.,3,Big Bang Theory,18,3
10428,Penny,3, Thank you.,3,Big Bang Theory,11,2
10430,Raj,3, Are you seriously going to deface your body just for the possibility you could have cheap sex with a strange girl you met in a bar?,3,Big Bang Theory,132,26
10431,Howard,3," Uh, yeah!",3,Big Bang Theory,10,2
10432,Raj,3, What is your mother going to say?,3,Big Bang Theory,34,7
10433,Howard,3, She's not going to see it. She takes my temperature orally now.,3,Big Bang Theory,64,12
10435,Howard,3," Well, I can't really decide between a screaming devil, this mean little skull or Kermit the Frog.",3,Big Bang Theory,98,17
10437,Howard,3," You know  Hi ho, I'm on Howard's butt!",3,Big Bang Theory,39,8
10439,Howard,3," Yeah, I'd like the mean little skull, please.",3,Big Bang Theory,46,8
10441,Raj,3," With my luck, hepatitis",3,Big Bang Theory,24,4
10443,Howard,3," Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!",3,Big Bang Theory,20,5
10445,Howard,3," I know, but it was cold. Ow, ow, ow!",3,Big Bang Theory,37,9
10447,Howard,3, What comes after the stencil?,3,Big Bang Theory,30,5
10449,Howard,3," Aaaaaargh! Okay, that's it, no needle, no pain, no tattoo.",3,Big Bang Theory,59,10
10451,Howard,3," No, I haven't, look.  I'm sorry, I'm a fraud, he's a fraud.",3,Big Bang Theory,60,12
10452,Raj,3, We're both frauds.,3,Big Bang Theory,19,3
10453,Howard,3," Yeah, I think I covered that.",3,Big Bang Theory,30,6
10454,Raj,3, But I was summing up.,3,Big Bang Theory,22,5
10455,Howard,3," We're not goth, we're just guys.",3,Big Bang Theory,33,6
10456,Raj,3," Very, very smart guys.",3,Big Bang Theory,23,4
10458,Howard,3, Yes. And I wouldn't blame you if you walked out of here and never wanted to see us again. Unless of course our bold honesty has suddenly made us attractive.,3,Big Bang Theory,157,30
10461,Raj,3," When we tell this story, let's end it differently.",3,Big Bang Theory,51,9
10462,Howard,3, What are you thinking? Maybe a big musical number?,3,Big Bang Theory,51,9
10464,Sheldon,3," Well, I'm going to make some warm milk and then turn in. I trust if you two are planning in engaging in amorous activites, you'll keep the decibel level to a minimum.",3,Big Bang Theory,167,32
10465,Penny,3, Of course.,3,Big Bang Theory,11,2
10466,Sheldon,3, Thank you. ,3,Big Bang Theory,12,2
10467,Penny,3," Mmm, these are so good",3,Big Bang Theory,23,5
10468,Leonard,3, Unbelievable.,3,Big Bang Theory,14,1
10469,Penny,3, What?,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
10470,Leonard,3," I was just thinking, we should probably turn in too.",3,Big Bang Theory,53,10
10471,Penny,3," well, my new bed got delivered, if you come over and put it together, you can stay at my place.",3,Big Bang Theory,96,20
10472,Leonard,3," Really, that's a lot of work, and it's kind of late.",3,Big Bang Theory,53,11
10473,Penny,3," Yeah, but if we stay there, we won't have to be quiet.",3,Big Bang Theory,55,12
10474,Leonard,3, Let's go.,3,Big Bang Theory,10,2
10475,Sheldon,3, Interesting. Sex works even better than chocolate to modify behaviour. I wonder if anyone else has stumbled on to that.,3,Big Bang Theory,120,20
10477,Howard,3," Okay, wait, how about this? We say there were four goth girls, the two girls in the club had two friends.",3,Big Bang Theory,106,21
10478,Raj,3," I like it, I like it. Did they smell good despite their gothlike nature?",3,Big Bang Theory,73,14
10479,Howard,3, What's that got to do with the story?,3,Big Bang Theory,38,8
10480,Raj,3, Engaging my olfactory sense helps make it real for me.,3,Big Bang Theory,55,10
10481,Howard,3," Fine, they smelled good.",3,Big Bang Theory,25,4
10482,Raj,3," Oh, they did. Like jasmine and honeysuckle.",3,Big Bang Theory,44,7
10483,Howard,3, Whatever.,3,Big Bang Theory,10,1
10484,Raj,3," And then they held hands and did a sexy, demonic hokey-pokey for us.",3,Big Bang Theory,69,13
10485,Howard,3," No, no. Look, let me say my story all the way through, and then you can say yours, and then we'll pick.",3,Big Bang Theory,104,22
10486,Raj,3, I'm sorry. Go on.,3,Big Bang Theory,18,4
10487,Howard,3," Okay. We got tattoos, and then the four girls took us to their place.",3,Big Bang Theory,70,14
10488,Raj,3, But we don't have tattoos. What if someone asks to see our tattoos?,3,Big Bang Theory,68,13
10489,Howard,3, We say they're in a very intimate area.,3,Big Bang Theory,40,8
10490,Raj,3," Oh, we are bad boys, aren't we?",3,Big Bang Theory,32,7
10491,Howard,3," Right, right, so we go back to their place, and then the six of us end up in a hot tub.",3,Big Bang Theory,88,21
10492,Raj,3, But we just got tattoos. Wouldn't we be concerned about bacterial infection?,3,Big Bang Theory,77,12
10493,Howard,3," True. Okay, forget the hot tub. The point is, we each have a mÃ©nage with sexy goth girls.",3,Big Bang Theory,91,18
10494,Raj,3, Wow. What a great night.,3,Big Bang Theory,25,5
10495,Howard,3," Yeah. Hey, want to try a country bar tomorrow night.",3,Big Bang Theory,53,10
10496,Raj,3," Yeah, maybe we'll get lucky with some sexy cowgirls.",3,Big Bang Theory,53,9
10497,Howard,3, Could happen.,3,Big Bang Theory,14,2
10498,Raj,3, I wonder how they smell.,3,Big Bang Theory,25,5
10500,Sheldon,4, This movie baffles me every time we watch it.,3,Big Bang Theory,46,9
10501,Leonard,4, What do you mean?,3,Big Bang Theory,18,4
10502,Sheldon,4," Well, the instructions are very clear, don't feed the gremlins after midnight, don't get the gremlins wet. How hard is that?",3,Big Bang Theory,125,21
10503,Penny,4," Hi, guys. Hi, honey.",3,Big Bang Theory,21,4
10504,Leonard,4, Hey.,3,Big Bang Theory,5,1
10505,Howard,4," Ooh, we're honey now, are we?",3,Big Bang Theory,30,6
10506,Sheldon,4," Yes. Since their relationship became carnal, Penny has upgraded his designated term of endearment, thus distinguishing him from those she calls sweetie, usually in an attempt to soften a thinly-veiled insult.",3,Big Bang Theory,209,31
10507,Penny,4, You're boring people sweetie.,3,Big Bang Theory,30,4
10508,Sheldon,4," Although, sometimes, she omits the veil entirely.",3,Big Bang Theory,50,7
10509,Penny,4," So, what are you guys doing?",3,Big Bang Theory,29,6
10510,Howard,4, Celebrating Columbus Day.,3,Big Bang Theory,26,3
10511,Leonard,4," We're watching Goonies, Gremlins and Young Sherlock Holmes. They were all written by Chris Columbus.",3,Big Bang Theory,101,15
10512,Penny,4, Okay. What do you watch on Thanksgiving?,3,Big Bang Theory,41,7
10513,Sheldon,4, The parade.,3,Big Bang Theory,12,2
10514,Penny,4," Oh, you know, that reminds me, I usually go back to Nebraska for thanksgiving, but this year they're calling it off on account of my brother's trial.",3,Big Bang Theory,150,27
10515,Leonard,4, What's he on trial for?,3,Big Bang Theory,24,5
10516,Penny,4," Oh, just a big misunderstanding. You know, you'd actually like my brother, he's kind of a chemist. Anyway, I was thinking I'd have thanksgiving here, and you are all invited.",3,Big Bang Theory,175,30
10517,Leonard,4, Oh. I'll be there.,3,Big Bang Theory,19,4
10518,Sheldon,4, Will you be serving cranberry jelly or cranberry sauce?,3,Big Bang Theory,56,9
10519,Penny,4, I guess I could serve both.,3,Big Bang Theory,28,6
10520,Sheldon,4, You guess? You don't seem to have much of a handle on this.,3,Big Bang Theory,60,13
10521,Howard,4," Yeah, I really wish I could, Penny, but every year my mother has all the relatives over and cooks up her famous tur-briska-fil.",3,Big Bang Theory,128,23
10522,Penny,4, Tur-briska-fil?,3,Big Bang Theory,16,1
10523,Howard,4, Turkey stuffed with a brisket stuffed with gefilte fish. It's not as good as it sounds.,3,Big Bang Theory,88,16
10524,Penny,4," Raj, what about you?",3,Big Bang Theory,21,4
10525,Howard,4," Oh, he usually comes to my house. Right, pal?  All right, this year, you don't have to eat the tur-briska-fil. I don't even chew it. I swallow it like pills.",3,Big Bang Theory,158,30
10527,Leonard,4," So, what's going on with Raj?",3,Big Bang Theory,30,6
10528,Howard,4," Well, the good news is, he has no problem with my mother's tur-brka-fil.",3,Big Bang Theory,73,13
10529,Penny,4," Hard to believe, but go on.",3,Big Bang Theory,28,6
10530,Howard,4," The bad news is, he says he's getting deported.",3,Big Bang Theory,48,9
10531,Leonard,4," What do you mean, he's getting deported?",3,Big Bang Theory,41,7
10532,Sheldon,4," I believe it means that the U.S. Government is going to expel him from the country. He could then either return to his native India, emigrate to another country that's willing to accept him, or wander the high seas as a stateless pirate. Personally, I'd choose pirate.",3,Big Bang Theory,269,47
10533,Howard,4," Penny, would you mind stepping outside so we can speak to him?",3,Big Bang Theory,63,12
10534,Penny,4," Ugh, fine. But the man really needs to work on his girl issues.",3,Big Bang Theory,64,13
10535,Sheldon,4," Another reason to consider a life of piracy. Even today, I understand that's an all-male profession.",3,Big Bang Theory,101,16
10536,Howard,4," Okay, she's gone.",3,Big Bang Theory,18,3
10537,Raj,4, Sorry. I lost my cool.,3,Big Bang Theory,23,5
10538,Leonard,4," So, what's going on?",3,Big Bang Theory,21,4
10539,Raj,4," Okay, here's the deal, six months ago, my research testing the predicted composition of trans-Neptunian objects ran into a dead end.",3,Big Bang Theory,133,21
10540,Howard,4, So?,3,Big Bang Theory,4,1
10541,Raj,4," So, my visa's only good as long as I'm employed at the university, and when they find out I've got squat, they're going to cut me off. By the way, when I say squat, I mean diddly-squat. I wish I had squat.",3,Big Bang Theory,206,42
10542,Leonard,4," So, wait, what have you been doing for the past six months?",3,Big Bang Theory,60,12
10543,Raj,4," You know, checking e-mail, updating my facebook status, messing up wikipedia entries. Hey, did you know Netflix lets you stream movies on your computer now?",3,Big Bang Theory,157,25
10544,Sheldon,4, And you've continued to take the university's money under false pretences? Highly unethical for an astrophysicist. Although practically mandatory for a pirate.,3,Big Bang Theory,160,22
10545,Raj,4," I don't want to go back to India. It's hot and loud, and there's so many people. You have no idea, they're everywhere.",3,Big Bang Theory,119,23
10546,Howard,4," Okay, guys, think, how do we keep Raj in the country?",3,Big Bang Theory,54,11
10547,Penny,4, Why doesn't he just get another job?,3,Big Bang Theory,37,7
10548,Howard,4, What are you asking me for? I don't know if you can talk now or not.,3,Big Bang Theory,69,16
10550,Raj,4," Oh, beef, I'm going to miss you so much. Do you know, at the Mumbai McDonald's, you can't get a Big Mac? All you can get is a Chicken Maharaja Mac. And the special sauce, curry, which, in India,",3,Big Bang Theory,195,39
10551,Leonard,4," Don't worry, you'll find another job.",3,Big Bang Theory,38,6
10552,Raj,4, Yeah let me start practicing for it. Do you want fries with that Maharaja Mac?â€ù,3,Big Bang Theory,82,15
10553,Sheldon,4," Hi, Leonard. Hello, Raj.",3,Big Bang Theory,25,4
10554,Raj,4, Hello Sheldon.,3,Big Bang Theory,15,2
10555,Sheldon,4," Forgive me, as you know, I'm no adept at reading facial cues, but I'm going to take a stab here, you're either sad or nauseated.",3,Big Bang Theory,129,25
10556,Raj,4, I'm sad.,3,Big Bang Theory,9,2
10557,Sheldon,4, I was going to say sad. I don't know why I hedged.,3,Big Bang Theory,51,12
10558,Raj,4, What are you eating?,3,Big Bang Theory,21,4
10559,Sheldon,4, Elbow macaroni with ground hamburger and tomato sauce.,3,Big Bang Theory,55,8
10560,Raj,4," Oh, beefaroni. I think I'll miss you most of all.",3,Big Bang Theory,50,10
10561,Leonard,4, I've always been a little confused about this. Why don't Hindus eat beef?,3,Big Bang Theory,74,13
10562,Raj,4, We believe cows are gods.,3,Big Bang Theory,26,5
10563,Sheldon,4," Not technically. In Hinduism, cattle are thought to be like God.",3,Big Bang Theory,65,11
10564,Raj,4," Do not tell me about my own culture, Sheldon! In the mood I'm in, I'll take you out, I swear to cow!",3,Big Bang Theory,101,22
10565,Sheldon,4, I'm sorry.,3,Big Bang Theory,11,2
10566,Raj,4," Me, too. I'm just, I'm a little on edge.",3,Big Bang Theory,41,9
10567,Sheldon,4," Understandable. Your entire life seems to be crumbling around you, and your future appears bleak at best.",3,Big Bang Theory,106,17
10568,Raj,4, Thank you.,3,Big Bang Theory,11,2
10569,Sheldon,4, And you're wrong about Hinduism and cows.,3,Big Bang Theory,42,7
10570,Howard,4," Hey, Raj, guess what. Professor Laughlin is looking for someone to join the stellar evolution research team.",3,Big Bang Theory,109,17
10571,Raj,4," You, you're kidding. That's fantastic!",3,Big Bang Theory,39,5
10572,Howard,4," Come on, what are you waiting for? Call him and set up an interview.",3,Big Bang Theory,69,14
10573,Raj,4, I'm on it.,3,Big Bang Theory,11,3
10574,Sheldon,4," That's happy, right?",3,Big Bang Theory,21,3
10575,Leonard,4, Yeah.,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
10576,Sheldon,4, Nailed it.,3,Big Bang Theory,11,2
10579,Raj,4," No, no, it's a very promising area. In a perfect world I'd spend several more years on it. But I just couldn't pass up the opportunity to work with you on your tremendously exciting and not yet conclusively disproved hypothesis.",3,Big Bang Theory,229,40
10581,Raj,4," It's a little early, isn't it?",3,Big Bang Theory,31,6
10583,Raj,4," That's very good. Jolly amusing, but if you don't mind, I'll hold off until sunset on titan.",3,Big Bang Theory,93,17
10585,Raj,4," Thank you, sir. ",3,Big Bang Theory,17,3
10589,Raj,4," Well, I ran a simulation that allowed me to correct for the observational efficiency.",3,Big Bang Theory,86,14
10591,Raj,4," Thank you. Would you like to hear more about it in my hot tub? So, when do I start?",3,Big Bang Theory,84,19
10593,Howard,4, What do you mean you didn't get the job? How could you not get it?,3,Big Bang Theory,67,15
10594,Raj,4," You know, he's British, I'm Indian, ever since Gandhi they haven't liked us very much.",3,Big Bang Theory,87,15
10595,Leonard,4," Wait, are you saying that he discriminated against you? Because we should file a complaint.",3,Big Bang Theory,92,15
10596,Raj,4," That's okay. A complaint has been filed. So, that's it. That was my last hope. I'm going to be deported, sent home in disgrace, exposed to the sardonic barbs of my cousin Sanjay. Or, as you may know him, Dave from AT&T customer service.",3,Big Bang Theory,237,44
10597,Howard,4, I'm really going to miss you.,3,Big Bang Theory,30,6
10598,Raj,4, Will you come visit me in India?,3,Big Bang Theory,33,7
10599,Howard,4," Gee, that's, like, a 17-hour flight. How about I meet you halfway?",3,Big Bang Theory,67,12
10600,Raj,4, Halfway is 600 miles off the coast of Japan.,3,Big Bang Theory,45,9
10601,Howard,4," Tell you what, we'll skype.",3,Big Bang Theory,28,5
10602,Sheldon,4, Gentlemen.,3,Big Bang Theory,11,1
10603,Leonard,4, Hey.,3,Big Bang Theory,5,1
10604,Sheldon,4," Raj, did you get the job with Professor Laughlin?",3,Big Bang Theory,50,9
10605,Raj,4, No.,3,Big Bang Theory,4,1
10606,Sheldon,4," I assumed as much. But never fear. Like the subordinate male protagonist in countless action movies who disappears half way through the second reel, I have returned to save the day. Odd, usually, he's met by cheers. Anyway, I was thinking about exploring the string theory implications of gamma rays from dark matter annihilations, and it occurred to me that I could benefit",3,Big Bang Theory,375,63
10607,Leonard,4," Excuse me, Sheldon, how many reels before the subordinate male protagonist gets to his point?",3,Big Bang Theory,94,15
10608,Sheldon,4," I'm sorry, if you didn't cheer at my entrance, it's too late to buy into the premise. Anyway, I got some extra money from the head of the department, and raj can come work for me.",3,Big Bang Theory,180,36
10609,Raj,4, You want me to work with you?,3,Big Bang Theory,30,7
10610,Sheldon,4, For me. You're going to have to listen more carefully when you're on the job.,3,Big Bang Theory,78,15
10611,Raj,4," Okay, uh, please don't take this the wrong way, but I'd rather swim buck-naked across the Ganges with a paper cut on my nipple and die a slow, agonizing death from a viral infection than work with you.",3,Big Bang Theory,202,38
10612,Sheldon,4, For me.,3,Big Bang Theory,8,2
10614,Raj,4," Sheldon, are you busy?",3,Big Bang Theory,23,4
10615,Sheldon,4, Of course I'm busy.,3,Big Bang Theory,20,4
10616,Raj,4, Shall I wait?,3,Big Bang Theory,14,3
10617,Sheldon,4," Yes, please.  How may I help you?",3,Big Bang Theory,34,7
10618,Raj,4, I've reconsidered your offer to let me work with you.,3,Big Bang Theory,54,10
10619,Sheldon,4, For me.,3,Big Bang Theory,8,2
10620,Raj,4," Yes, for you. I do, however, have a few conditions. First, at all times, I am to be treated as a colleague and an equal. Second, my contributions shall be noted in all published material. And third, you are never allowed to lecture me on Hinduism or my Indian culture.",3,Big Bang Theory,269,50
10621,Sheldon,4," I'm impressed, Raj. Those are very cogent and reasonable conditions.",3,Big Bang Theory,69,10
10622,Raj,4, Thank you.,3,Big Bang Theory,11,2
10623,Sheldon,4, I reject them all.,3,Big Bang Theory,19,4
10624,Raj,4, Then you leave me no choice. I accept the job.,3,Big Bang Theory,47,10
10625,Sheldon,4," I'm sorry, I believe you've misunderstood. I'm not giving you the job. I'm simply affording you the opportunity to apply for it. Have a seat, we'll get started with the interview.",3,Big Bang Theory,180,31
10626,Raj,4, Wha You're kidding!,3,Big Bang Theory,20,3
10627,Sheldon,4, Please.,3,Big Bang Theory,8,1
10628,Raj,4, All right.,3,Big Bang Theory,11,2
10629,Sheldon,4," So, that's what you wear to an interview?",3,Big Bang Theory,42,8
10630,Raj,4," Come on, dude, we've been friends for years.",3,Big Bang Theory,45,8
10631,Sheldon,4," Oh, pulling strings, are we?",3,Big Bang Theory,29,5
10632,Raj,4," Sheldon, for God's sakes, don't make me beg.",3,Big Bang Theory,45,8
10633,Sheldon,4, Bazinga! You've fallen victim to another one of my classic practical jokes. I'm your boss now. You may want to laugh at that.,3,Big Bang Theory,126,23
10635,Penny,4," Ah, it's nice having the place to ourselves, isn't it?",3,Big Bang Theory,55,10
10636,Leonard,4," Uh-huh. Now that Raj is working for Sheldon, I don't have to chauffeur him around anymore. Plus, yeah, with them working late so much, we get some privacy.",3,Big Bang Theory,156,28
10637,Penny,4," Mm-hmm. Hey, want to get a little crazy?",3,Big Bang Theory,41,8
10638,Leonard,4, What are you thinking?,3,Big Bang Theory,23,4
10639,Penny,4, Let's slide over to Sheldon's spot a make out.,3,Big Bang Theory,47,9
10640,Leonard,4, You are a dirty girl.,3,Big Bang Theory,22,5
10641,Penny,4," Oh, God, how did he know?",3,Big Bang Theory,26,6
10642,Howard,4, Hello.,3,Big Bang Theory,7,1
10643,Leonard,4," Hi, Howard.",3,Big Bang Theory,12,2
10644,Howard,4, Am I interrupting?,3,Big Bang Theory,19,3
10645,Leonard,4," Little bit, yeah.",3,Big Bang Theory,18,3
10646,Howard,4, Guess I should have called.,3,Big Bang Theory,28,5
10647,Penny,4," Yeah, maybe.",3,Big Bang Theory,13,2
10648,Howard,4, Tonight's the night I usually go line dancing with Raj at the palomino.,3,Big Bang Theory,72,13
10649,Leonard,4, Uh-huh.,3,Big Bang Theory,8,1
10650,Howard,4, But he's working with Sheldon.,3,Big Bang Theory,31,5
10651,Penny,4," Yes, we know.",3,Big Bang Theory,14,3
10652,Howard,4, Want me to leave?,3,Big Bang Theory,18,4
10653,Leonard,4," You know, whatever.",3,Big Bang Theory,20,3
10654,Howard,4," Okay, I guess I can hang for a little while. So what are we watching? Sex and the city.",3,Big Bang Theory,88,19
10655,Penny,4," Hey, I happen to love this movie.",3,Big Bang Theory,34,7
10656,Howard,4," Fine, let's watch it. Maybe all our periods will synchronize.",3,Big Bang Theory,62,10
10658,Sheldon,4," All right, we're going to be designing an experiment to look for the annihilation spectrum resulting from dark matter collisions in space.",3,Big Bang Theory,139,22
10659,Raj,4," Ooh, dark matter. We better bring a flashlight. I was making a joke.",3,Big Bang Theory,69,13
10660,Sheldon,4, I'm the boss. I make the jokes.,3,Big Bang Theory,32,7
10661,Raj,4," Sorry, go ahead and make your joke.",3,Big Bang Theory,36,7
10662,Sheldon,4," This is not the time for joking. We're doing serious research, which requires complete and utter focus.",3,Big Bang Theory,104,17
10663,Raj,4," All right, let's buckle down and work.",3,Big Bang Theory,39,7
10664,Raj,4, Sheldon.,3,Big Bang Theory,9,1
10665,Sheldon,4, What?,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
10666,Raj,4, I need an aspirin.,3,Big Bang Theory,19,4
10667,Sheldon,4, Top desk drawer.,3,Big Bang Theory,17,3
10668,Raj,4, Thank you.,3,Big Bang Theory,11,2
10669,Sheldon,4, Alright?,3,Big Bang Theory,9,1
10670,Raj,4, Yes.,3,Big Bang Theory,5,1
10671,Sheldon,4, Good.,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
10673,Leonard,4, That was fun. Thank you.,3,Big Bang Theory,25,5
10674,Penny,4," Leonard, honey, you don't have to say thank you every time we have sex.",3,Big Bang Theory,72,14
10675,Leonard,4, Oh. Okay. Tomorrow you're going to get a card in the mail. Just throw it away.,3,Big Bang Theory,79,16
10676,Howard,4, Top o' the mornin'o ya!,3,Big Bang Theory,24,5
10677,Leonard,4, What are you doing here?,3,Big Bang Theory,25,5
10678,Howard,4," Well, usually, on Sundays, I go with Raj to scam on hippie chicks at the farmers market, but he's still working with Sheldon, so I thought I'd come over here and make you guys scrambled eggs and salami. It's the perfect meal for apres l'amour.",3,Big Bang Theory,244,45
10679,Penny,4," Oh, kill me.",3,Big Bang Theory,13,3
10680,Howard,4," By the way, I couldn't help overhearing your big finish. Bravo, Leonard.",3,Big Bang Theory,73,12
10681,Penny,4," See, if you had killed me when I said kill me, I wouldn't have had to hear that.",3,Big Bang Theory,81,18
10682,Howard,4," What do you guys think? Want to take in a matinee, maybe go rollerblading, catch a step class?",3,Big Bang Theory,95,18
10683,Penny,4, Do something.,3,Big Bang Theory,14,2
10684,Leonard,4," Yeah, okay. Um, Howard, we need to talk.",3,Big Bang Theory,41,8
10685,Howard,4," Sure. â€˜sup, homes?",3,Big Bang Theory,21,3
10686,Leonard,4," Uh, please understand that it's not that we don't want you around, but Penny and I occasionally need some alone time.",3,Big Bang Theory,118,21
10687,Howard,4," Oh. I get it, I'm the third wheel. Sorry, I should have seen that. I'll get out of your way. Uh, you're gonna want to eat those eggs while they're still hot.",3,Big Bang Theory,158,32
10688,Leonard,4," Thank you. There's lox and cream cheese in the fridge, the bagels are in the oven, I was warming them up.",3,Big Bang Theory,106,21
10689,Penny,4, That's great.,3,Big Bang Theory,14,2
10690,Howard,4, Ill just hang out with my mom. That's always fun.,3,Big Bang Theory,50,10
10691,Leonard,4, Good.,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
10692,Penny,4, Are we terrible people?,3,Big Bang Theory,24,4
10693,Leonard,4, I don't know. What do you want me to do?,3,Big Bang Theory,41,10
10694,Penny,4," Get him, bring him back.",3,Big Bang Theory,25,5
10695,Leonard,4, Are you sure?,3,Big Bang Theory,14,3
10696,Penny,4, Yeah.,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
10697,Leonard,4, Okay. Howard come back.,3,Big Bang Theory,24,4
10698,Howard,4," Oh, you guys had me scared for a minute.",3,Big Bang Theory,41,9
10700,Raj,4," No, no, no, no! That rate is much too low for what we'd expect from this collision. Do you understand that we're talking about dark matter colliding in outer space?",3,Big Bang Theory,165,30
10701,Sheldon,4, Of course I understand. And who are you to tell me about outer space?,3,Big Bang Theory,70,14
10702,Raj,4, I'm the astrophysicist. Astro means space.,3,Big Bang Theory,43,6
10703,Sheldon,4, Astro means star.,3,Big Bang Theory,18,3
10704,Raj,4," Okay, well, let me just tell you, if we were having this argument in my native language, I'd be kicking your butt.",3,Big Bang Theory,115,22
10705,Sheldon,4, English is your native language.,3,Big Bang Theory,33,5
10706,Raj,4," Okay, you got me there, but you're wrong about this!",3,Big Bang Theory,53,10
10707,Sheldon,4, There is a fine line between wrong and visionary. Unfortunately you have to be a visionary to see it.,3,Big Bang Theory,102,19
10708,Raj,4," My god, you think that every thought that comes out of your head is pure gold. Well, let me tell you something. Some of those thoughts are pure caca.",3,Big Bang Theory,150,29
10709,Sheldon,4, Caca?,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
10710,Raj,4, It means doo-doo.,3,Big Bang Theory,18,3
10711,Sheldon,4," All right! First of all, Dr. Koothrappali, when I first proposed that you work with me",3,Big Bang Theory,87,16
10712,Raj,4, Aha! So I am working with you.,3,Big Bang Theory,31,7
10713,Sheldon,4," In this context, with me means for me.",3,Big Bang Theory,39,8
10714,Raj,4," Ah, well, in this context ",3,Big Bang Theory,27,5
10715,Sheldon,4," Oh! If I'm wrong, prove it.",3,Big Bang Theory,28,6
10716,Raj,4, Okay. Here's where we derive the mass of the dark matter particle.,3,Big Bang Theory,67,12
10717,Sheldon,4," No, no, no, you've misstated the atomic weight of the target.",3,Big Bang Theory,62,11
10718,Raj,4, Let me finish.,3,Big Bang Theory,15,3
10719,Sheldon,4, You're defacing my work.,3,Big Bang Theory,25,4
10720,Raj,4," I'm not defacing it, I'm fixing it.",3,Big Bang Theory,36,7
10721,Sheldon,4, Give me the eraser.,3,Big Bang Theory,20,4
10722,Raj,4, No.,3,Big Bang Theory,4,1
10723,Sheldon,4, I said give it to me.,3,Big Bang Theory,22,6
10724,Raj,4, Come and get it.,3,Big Bang Theory,17,4
10725,Sheldon,4," Fine.  Oh, lord. Dr. Koothrappali, as your superior, I forbid you from writing on my board!",3,Big Bang Theory,92,16
10726,Raj,4, You are not my superior.,3,Big Bang Theory,25,5
10727,Sheldon,4, I am in every way.,3,Big Bang Theory,19,5
10728,Raj,4," Oh, yeah? Can you do this?  Nice working with you. I'm sorry, for you. ",3,Big Bang Theory,72,14
10730,Sheldon,4,  Raj.  Raj.  Raj.,3,Big Bang Theory,18,3
10731,Raj,4, I'm busy.,3,Big Bang Theory,10,2
10732,Sheldon,4," Doing what?  All right, you've made your point.",3,Big Bang Theory,48,8
10733,Raj,4," What do you want, Sheldon?",3,Big Bang Theory,27,5
10734,Sheldon,4, I looked over the board and it turns out you were right.,3,Big Bang Theory,57,12
10735,Raj,4, So you were wrong.,3,Big Bang Theory,19,4
10736,Sheldon,4, I didn't say that.,3,Big Bang Theory,19,4
10737,Raj,4, That's the only logical inference.,3,Big Bang Theory,35,5
10738,Sheldon,4," Nevertheless, I didn't say it. Anyway, I would like you to come back and work for me.",3,Big Bang Theory,86,17
10739,Raj,4, For you or with you?,3,Big Bang Theory,21,5
10740,Sheldon,4, In this context for me could mean with me.,3,Big Bang Theory,43,9
10741,Raj,4," All right, but I have some conditions.",3,Big Bang Theory,39,7
10742,Sheldon,4, I reject them all.,3,Big Bang Theory,19,4
10743,Raj,4, I'll take the job. See you Monday.,3,Big Bang Theory,35,7
10744,Sheldon,4," Wait, you have to drive me home.",3,Big Bang Theory,33,7
10745,Raj,4, How did you get here?,3,Big Bang Theory,22,5
10746,Sheldon,4, I walked.,3,Big Bang Theory,10,2
10747,Raj,4, So walk home.,3,Big Bang Theory,14,3
10748,Sheldon,4," I can't. There's a big dog outside. On the way home, we can start thinking about methods of optimizing the detector for 500 GEV particles.",3,Big Bang Theory,139,25
10749,Raj,4, All right. ,3,Big Bang Theory,12,2
10751,Howard,5," All right, Raj has played his phantom warlord card, and I am going to back him up with my strangling vines. Choke on that, sucka.",3,Big Bang Theory,130,25
10752,Leonard,5," Okay, well, then I'll just cut your vines with my ruby sword. That's right, I did it. I cut 'em.",3,Big Bang Theory,97,20
10753,Penny,5," Um, I have a question.",3,Big Bang Theory,23,5
10754,Leonard,5," Warlord beats troll, troll beats elf, elf beats water sprite, and basically everything beats enchanted bunny.",3,Big Bang Theory,110,16
10755,Howard,5, Unless you have the carrot power.,3,Big Bang Theory,34,6
10756,Penny,5," Okay, I've got another question. When does this get fun?",3,Big Bang Theory,57,10
10757,Howard,5, Are we going to talk or are we going to play Mystic Warlords of Ka-ah?,3,Big Bang Theory,71,15
10758,Leonard,5, Just play a potion card.,3,Big Bang Theory,25,5
10759,Penny,5, Which one?,3,Big Bang Theory,11,2
10760,Sheldon,5, It doesn't matter. You can't possibly win.,3,Big Bang Theory,43,7
10761,Leonard,5," Sheldon, don't ruin the game.",3,Big Bang Theory,30,5
10762,Penny,5, How could he ruin the game?,3,Big Bang Theory,28,6
10763,Sheldon,5," Given the cards that have already been played, Penny can only be holding necromancer potions, which are only effective against wraiths and day-walkers, and there are no more of either left to be drawn. The cards remaining in the undrawn stack are four fire weapons, a troll, two ogres and the jewel of Osiris.",3,Big Bang Theory,310,54
10764,Leonard,5, See? Ruined.,3,Big Bang Theory,13,2
10765,Penny,5," Sheldon, that is incredible.",3,Big Bang Theory,29,4
10766,Sheldon,5," From your vantage point, it certainly must seem so.",3,Big Bang Theory,52,9
10767,Leonard,5, Sheldon has kind of a photographic memory.,3,Big Bang Theory,43,7
10768,Sheldon,5," Photographic is a misnomer. I have an eidetic memory, as I've told you many times. Most recently last year during lunch on the afternoon of may seventh. You had turkey and complained it was dry.",3,Big Bang Theory,195,35
10769,Howard,5," Well, I guess game's over.",3,Big Bang Theory,27,5
10770,Penny,5," Really? Oh, great. I mean, aw. Okay, I gotta go.",3,Big Bang Theory,49,10
10771,Leonard,5, Why?,3,Big Bang Theory,5,1
10772,Penny,5," Because the last me I didn't go, I ended up playing Mystic Warlords of Ka.",3,Big Bang Theory,75,15
10773,Howard,5, Not Ka. Ka-ah.,3,Big Bang Theory,15,3
10774,Penny,5, Ba-eye.,3,Big Bang Theory,8,1
10775,Leonard,5, See ya. Still can't believe she's going out with me.,3,Big Bang Theory,53,10
10776,Raj,5, Nobody can.,3,Big Bang Theory,12,2
10777,Howard,5," That reminds me, I have a bone to pick with you.",3,Big Bang Theory,49,11
10778,Leonard,5, What?,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
10779,Howard,5," You and I made a pact that if either of us ever got a hot girlfriend, that person would have his girlfriend hook the other guy up with one of her girlfriends.",3,Big Bang Theory,159,32
10780,Leonard,5," Yeah, I don't remember that.",3,Big Bang Theory,29,5
10781,Sheldon,5," June 30th, 2004. Opening day of Spider-man 2 at the AMC Pasadena. They only had red icees, no blue.",3,Big Bang Theory,100,19
10782,Leonard,5," Oh, yeah.",3,Big Bang Theory,10,2
10783,Howard,5," So you've been with Penny for like a month and a half now. Where's my shorty, Morty?",3,Big Bang Theory,85,17
10784,Leonard,5," Howard, you can't hold me to that.",3,Big Bang Theory,35,7
10785,Howard,5, Why not?,3,Big Bang Theory,9,2
10786,Leonard,5," Because when I made that agreement, I didn't think I'd ever have a hot girlfriend. And I was positive you never would.",3,Big Bang Theory,119,22
10787,Raj,5," Hey, how come I wasn't part of this deal?",3,Big Bang Theory,42,9
10788,Sheldon,5, You had left the refreshment stand in order to indulge in your customary preemptive pre-show urination.,3,Big Bang Theory,104,16
10789,Raj,5," Oh, so that's how it works? I have a teeny bladder and now I don't get a hot girlfriend?",3,Big Bang Theory,89,19
10790,Howard,5," Yeah, Raj, that's how it works.",3,Big Bang Theory,32,6
10791,Raj,5, Damn.,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
10793,Leonard,5," Oh, damn it. Can I have a napkin?",3,Big Bang Theory,34,8
10794,Sheldon,5," I'm sorry, no.",3,Big Bang Theory,15,3
10795,Leonard,5, But you have a whole bunch of 'em.,3,Big Bang Theory,35,8
10796,Sheldon,5," Yes, I've moved to a four-napkin system. Lap, hands, face and personal emergencies. If you like, starting tomorrow, I'll add a guest napkin, but I'm afraid there's nothing I can do for you today.  Good luck. That's the face napkin.",3,Big Bang Theory,232,40
10797,Howard,5," So, have you talked to Penny yet?",3,Big Bang Theory,34,7
10798,Leonard,5," No, I haven't.",3,Big Bang Theory,15,3
10799,Howard,5, Why not?,3,Big Bang Theory,9,2
10800,Leonard,5," Because I've been busy, because I haven't figured out a way to bring it up, and mostly, and I can't stress how key this is, because I don't want to.",3,Big Bang Theory,149,30
10801,Howard,5," Leonard, a pact is a pact. You have to get Penny to fix me up.",3,Big Bang Theory,63,15
10802,Leonard,5," It's not that simple. What am I supposed to say? Penny, do you have any friends you'd like to never hear from again?",3,Big Bang Theory,117,23
10803,Howard,5," Come on, I'm smart, I have good job and I have only three percent body fat.",3,Big Bang Theory,76,16
10804,Raj,5," It's true. I've seen him at the beach, he's like a human chicken wing.",3,Big Bang Theory,71,14
10805,Howard,5," Leonard, come on.",3,Big Bang Theory,18,3
10806,Leonard,5, Fine. I'll ask if she has a friend for you.,3,Big Bang Theory,44,10
10807,Howard,5, A hot friend.,3,Big Bang Theory,14,3
10808,Leonard,5, Right.,3,Big Bang Theory,7,1
10809,Howard,5, And tall. I want our kids to be able to ride space mountain before they're 20.,3,Big Bang Theory,79,16
10810,Leonard,5, I'll see what I can do.,3,Big Bang Theory,24,6
10811,Raj,5," Hey, Sheldon, guess what I heard today?",3,Big Bang Theory,40,7
10812,Sheldon,5," I'd imagine you heard any number of things today. When you arrived at work you undoubtedly heard, hello, Raj, how are you, Raj? Given that you're wearing a new sweater-vest, you may have heard new sweater-vest? And possibly, though far less likely, nice sweater-vest.",3,Big Bang Theory,268,44
10813,Raj,5, Why don't I just tell you what I heard today.,3,Big Bang Theory,46,10
10814,Sheldon,5, That would probably save us some time.,3,Big Bang Theory,39,7
10815,Raj,5," Saturday night at the comic book store, they're having a Mystic Warlords of Ka-ah tournament. First prize is five hundred dollars. If we team up, we'd be unstoppable.",3,Big Bang Theory,167,28
10816,Sheldon,5," I'm sorry, Raj, but I have no interest in playing a game in which I find no challenge.",3,Big Bang Theory,87,18
10817,Raj,5, What about the money?,3,Big Bang Theory,22,4
10818,Sheldon,5, I have money.,3,Big Bang Theory,14,3
10819,Raj,5, But this is other money.,3,Big Bang Theory,25,5
10820,Sheldon,5, How does it different from the money I have?,3,Big Bang Theory,45,9
10821,Raj,5, Half of it will be mine.,3,Big Bang Theory,25,6
10822,Sheldon,5, Do you need it to buy a less disturbing sweater-vest?,3,Big Bang Theory,54,10
10823,Raj,5," Leonard, help.",3,Big Bang Theory,15,2
10824,Leonard,5, Are you kidding? I couldn't even talk him into giving me one of his freakin' napkins.,3,Big Bang Theory,86,16
10826,Penny,5," Wow, you really are a genius.",3,Big Bang Theory,30,6
10827,Leonard,5," Not really. I googled how to do that. So, listen, have you ever made a pact with someone?",3,Big Bang Theory,90,18
10828,Penny,5," You mean, like a pinky swear?",3,Big Bang Theory,30,6
10829,Leonard,5," Okay, fine, like a pinky swear.",3,Big Bang Theory,32,6
10830,Penny,5," Well, in the first grade, my friend Rosie and I made a pact to marry Bert and Ernie. You know, from Sesame Street?",3,Big Bang Theory,115,23
10831,Leonard,5," Yeah, I'm familiar with Bert and Ernie.",3,Big Bang Theory,40,7
10832,Penny,5, Then we found out we both wanted Ernie. We didn't speak again until middle school.,3,Big Bang Theory,83,15
10833,Leonard,5, Over puppets?,3,Big Bang Theory,14,2
10834,Penny,5," The heart wants what the heart wants, Leonard.",3,Big Bang Theory,47,8
10835,Leonard,5," Okay. Speaking of what the heart wants, um, a long time ago, I made a pact with Wolowitz that kind of involves you.",3,Big Bang Theory,116,23
10836,Penny,5," Okay, I don't know where you're going with this, but tread carefully because it may be the last conversation we ever have.",3,Big Bang Theory,123,22
10837,Leonard,5," No, no, nothing like that. The deal was that if either of us ever got a girlfriend, we'd have her fix the other one up with one of her friends.",3,Big Bang Theory,144,30
10838,Penny,5, And you thought a good time to bring this up be right after sex.,3,Big Bang Theory,65,14
10839,Leonard,5," Well, I sure as hell wasn't going to bring it up before sex, and during, I was trying to remember what I read on google, so",3,Big Bang Theory,124,26
10840,Penny,5, I'm not hooking Wolowitz up with one of my friends.,3,Big Bang Theory,52,10
10841,Leonard,5," Come on, it doesn't have to be a good friend. And you know that deep down inside, Howard's a really nice guy.",3,Big Bang Theory,110,22
10842,Penny,5, The problem isn't what's on the inside. It's the creepy candy coating.,3,Big Bang Theory,71,12
10843,Leonard,5, Will you at least think about it? Just as a favour to me?,3,Big Bang Theory,58,13
10844,Penny,5," Oh, great thing about Ernie, was he never asked me for anything. He just gave.",3,Big Bang Theory,79,15
10846,Sheldon,5, Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Betty and Veronica? Ugh.,3,Big Bang Theory,73,16
10848,Sheldon,5, Thank you. You just robbed me of the opportunity to stumble upon the figurine and make the oh-so-satisfying journey from discovery to desire to possession.,3,Big Bang Theory,156,25
10850,Sheldon,5, But I must have it.,3,Big Bang Theory,20,5
10852,Sheldon,5," Thank you. You know, I can buy all these things online. I come here for the personal service.",3,Big Bang Theory,94,18
10853,Raj,5," Hey, Stuart, is the Wil Wheaton signed up for the mystic warlords tournament THE Wil Wheaton from Star Trek?",3,Big Bang Theory,109,19
10856,Sheldon,5," You don't understand. Growing up, I idolized Wil Wheaton? Wesley Crusher had an eidetic memory just like me.",3,Big Bang Theory,109,18
10857,Raj,5," Oh, what a coincidence. Maybe you can discuss that with him while you're playing in the tournament. Sign here.",3,Big Bang Theory,111,19
10858,Sheldon,5," I was such a fan that in 1995, I travelled ten hours by bus to a sci-fi convention in Jackson, Mississippi, wearing my Star Fleet Academy cadet uniform in order to meet Wil Wheaton and get him to autograph my mint in-package Wesley Crusher action figure.",3,Big Bang Theory,255,46
10859,Raj,5," Ooh, it'll be like a reunion then. Sign here.",3,Big Bang Theory,46,9
10860,Sheldon,5," My arduous journey, however, was for naught. Although advertised to appear, he did not show up. It was at that moment, I vowed eternal hatred for Wil Wheaton.",3,Big Bang Theory,159,28
10861,Raj,5," Okay, great, you can tell him you hate him. Sign here.",3,Big Bang Theory,55,11
10862,Sheldon,5," It might also interest you to know that Wil Wheaton currently ranks sixth on my all-time enemies list, right between director Joel Schumacher, who nearly destroyed the Batman movie franchise, and Billy Sparks, who lived down the street from me and put dog poop on the handles of my bicycle.",3,Big Bang Theory,291,50
10863,Raj,5," Okay, I get it, he's a bad guy. Sign here.",3,Big Bang Theory,43,10
10864,Sheldon,5," In the words of Khan Noonien Singh in the immortal wrath of Khan, he tasks me, he tasks me and I shall have him.",3,Big Bang Theory,113,24
10865,Raj,5," No doubt, sign here.",3,Big Bang Theory,21,4
10866,Sheldon,5," From hell's heart, I stab at thee.",3,Big Bang Theory,35,7
10869,Howard,5," So, tell me more about the future mother of my children.",3,Big Bang Theory,57,11
10870,Penny,5," She's adorable, Howard. I think you'll like her.",3,Big Bang Theory,49,8
10871,Howard,5, Great. So what did you tell her about me? Did you mention the body fat?,3,Big Bang Theory,72,15
10872,Penny,5," No, I thought that would be a nice surprise for her.",3,Big Bang Theory,53,11
10873,Howard,5," Good, good.",3,Big Bang Theory,12,2
10874,Penny,5," I just told her you're an aerospace engineer, you speak five languages",3,Big Bang Theory,71,12
10875,Howard,5, Six if you count Klingon.,3,Big Bang Theory,26,5
10876,Leonard,5," Girls don't count Klingon, Howard. Right?",3,Big Bang Theory,42,6
10877,Penny,5," Right. Oh, and I told her you have an unhealthy attachment to your mother.",3,Big Bang Theory,75,14
10878,Howard,5, What?,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
10879,Penny,5, I'm kidding.,3,Big Bang Theory,13,2
10880,Leonard,5, Another delightful surprise for her.,3,Big Bang Theory,37,5
10882,Raj,5," Sheldon, it's your play. Sheldon.",3,Big Bang Theory,34,5
10883,Sheldon,5, My enchanted troll bludgeons your screaming harpy with a cursed mace. Game.,3,Big Bang Theory,76,12
10884,Raj,5," Sorry, boys. Say hi to your mother when she picks you up. Or I could just tell her later tonight! We pwned them, dude! Up top!",3,Big Bang Theory,127,26
10885,Sheldon,5," Look at him. Wil Wheaton, my old friend, I have chased you round the moons of Nibia and round the Antares maelstrom and round perdition's flames!",3,Big Bang Theory,146,26
10886,Raj,5," You know you keep quoting Wrath of Khan, but he was in next generation. It's a totally different set of characters.",3,Big Bang Theory,116,21
10887,Sheldon,5, Silence! How much longer must I wait for my revenge?,3,Big Bang Theory,53,10
10888,Raj,5," Well, if Wil Wheaton and Stuart win their match and we beat lonely Larry and Captain Sweatpants in the next round, we'll face off for the championship.",3,Big Bang Theory,152,27
10889,Sheldon,5," So, my path to satisfaction is blocked by lonely Larry and Captain Sweatpants. Very well. They must be destroyed.",3,Big Bang Theory,114,19
10890,Raj,5," Dude, you have to stop talking like that. It's really lame.",3,Big Bang Theory,60,11
10891,Sheldon,5, Silence!,3,Big Bang Theory,9,1
10893,Howard,5," So, Penny tells me you're working as a waitress to put yourself through grad school. That's pretty great, what are you studying?",3,Big Bang Theory,129,22
10895,Howard,5," Oh, cool. So you could study me.",3,Big Bang Theory,33,7
10897,Howard,5, Microbiology is the study of tiny living things.,3,Big Bang Theory,49,8
10899,Howard,5, And I said you could study me 'cause I'm a tiny living thing. It's a joke.,3,Big Bang Theory,75,16
10901,Howard,5, Do you like science-fiction?,3,Big Bang Theory,29,4
10903,Howard,5, Role-playing games?,3,Big Bang Theory,20,2
10905,Howard,5, Either.,3,Big Bang Theory,8,1
10907,Leonard,5, Gonna be a long night.,3,Big Bang Theory,23,5
10908,Penny,5," Yeah, well, it's your fault.",3,Big Bang Theory,29,5
10909,Leonard,5, I had to ask. You didn't have to say yes.,3,Big Bang Theory,42,10
10910,Howard,5, You like magic?,3,Big Bang Theory,16,3
10912,Howard,5, Okay.,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
10913,Leonard,5," Long, long night.",3,Big Bang Theory,18,3
10915,Sheldon,5," I play my endless serpent. Raj will play ecstatic frenzy, which means Larry will have to play chaos overlord, then Captain Sweatpants, molten river. I play nightshade dryad, game, set and match. Now fetch me Wil Wheaton! bortaS bIr jablu'DI' reH QaQqu' nay'",3,Big Bang Theory,258,43
10921,Howard,5, How about computers? Do you like computers?,3,Big Bang Theory,44,7
10923,Howard,5, Okay Puppies? Where do you stand on puppies?,3,Big Bang Theory,45,8
10925,Howard,5, Of course it did.,3,Big Bang Theory,18,4
10926,Leonard,5, How about that? Einstein was wrong.,3,Big Bang Theory,36,6
10927,Penny,5, What?,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
10928,Leonard,5, Approaching the speed of light doesn't slow down time. Approaching them does.,3,Big Bang Theory,78,12
10929,Howard,5," Excuse me. Oh, damn. It's my mother.",3,Big Bang Theory,37,7
10931,Howard,5," I'm torn. She might be dying, and, you know, I wouldn't want to miss that. On the other hand, if I let it go to voicemail, I could play it over and over.",3,Big Bang Theory,154,33
10933,Howard,5, Not as crazy as my mother makes me.,3,Big Bang Theory,36,8
10935,Howard,5, My mother calls me at work to see if I had a healthy bowel movement.,3,Big Bang Theory,69,15
10937,Howard,5, You live with your mother?,3,Big Bang Theory,27,5
10939,Howard,5," Ooh, rough. Okay, check this out. My mother made me wear rubber gloves to kindergarten so I wouldn't pick up a disease from the other children.",3,Big Bang Theory,144,26
10941,Howard,5," Oh, wow. You didn't, did you?",3,Big Bang Theory,30,6
10943,Howard,5, Corolla!,3,Big Bang Theory,9,1
10945,Howard,5, More wine?,3,Big Bang Theory,11,2
10947,Howard,5," Listen, you have to come to shabbat dinner at my house sometime.",3,Big Bang Theory,65,12
10949,Howard,5, A catholic girl like you wearing a big cross like that might just give my mother the big brain aneurysm I've been hoping for.,3,Big Bang Theory,126,24
10951,Howard,5, It's a date.,3,Big Bang Theory,13,3
10952,Penny,5, Am I a matchmaker or what?,3,Big Bang Theory,27,6

10966,Raj,5," Problem, Wil Wheaton?",3,Big Bang Theory,22,3
10968,Sheldon,5," You're holding two moderate spell cards, a small rock and a potion of Zancor, which will be about as much help as an air conditioner on the ice planet Hoth. Your only move is to play the potion, lose the skirmish, and two moves later, the game.",3,Big Bang Theory,245,47
10970,Sheldon,5," The year was 1995, the place, Jackson, Mississippi. Having spent ten hours on a bus, during which I had to twice violate my personal rule against relieving myself on board a moving vehicle, I finally arrived at the fourth annual Dixie-Trek convention only to find that my idol Wil Wheaton decided he had better things to do than to show up and sign my action figure.",3,Big Bang Theory,367,66
10972,Sheldon,5," You betrayed me, Wil Wheaton. Now I have my revenge.",3,Big Bang Theory,53,10
10974,Sheldon,5, Your mee-maw died? That's terrible.,3,Big Bang Theory,36,5
10976,Sheldon,5," No, no, I understand. Anything happened to my mee-maw, I'd be one inconsolable moon pie. I should clarify that statement by explaining that she calls me moon pie.",3,Big Bang Theory,163,28
10978,Sheldon,5," Oh, yes.",3,Big Bang Theory,9,2
10979,Raj,5," Okay, great, everybody loves their grandmas! Now, come on, Sheldon, finish him off!",3,Big Bang Theory,84,13
10981,Raj,5," What are you waiting for? Kill Wil Wheaton! From hell's heart, stab at him!",3,Big Bang Theory,76,14
10982,Sheldon,5, I can't.,3,Big Bang Theory,9,2
10983,Raj,5, Sure you can. Do it! Do it!,3,Big Bang Theory,28,7
10984,Sheldon,5," No. I came here to defeat Wil Wheaton, the man who destroyed my dreams. But I can't defeat Wil Wheaton, the man who loved his mee-maw. Enchanted bunny.",3,Big Bang Theory,152,28
10985,Raj,5, No! Not enchanted bunny!,3,Big Bang Theory,25,4

10992,Leonard,6," Kites, ho!",3,Big Bang Theory,11,2
10993,Howard,6, Kites ho!,3,Big Bang Theory,10,2
10994,Raj,6, Kites ho!,3,Big Bang Theory,10,2
10996,Sheldon,6," Excuse me. You're misusing the word ho. It's an interjection used to call attention to a destination, not an object, as in, uh, Land, ho! Or, uh, Westward, ho!",3,Big Bang Theory,160,29
10998,Penny,6," Hey, guys. What you doing? Going out to discover electricity?",3,Big Bang Theory,62,10
10999,Leonard,6," If you're referring to the work of Benjamin Franklin, he did not discover electricity, he merely used a kite to determine that lightning consists of electricity. He also invented the Franklin stove, bifocals and the flexible urinary catheter. Kites, ho.",3,Big Bang Theory,254,40
11000,Leonard,6, We're heading out for some kite fighting.,3,Big Bang Theory,42,7
11001,Penny,6, Kite fighting?,3,Big Bang Theory,15,2
11002,Leonard,6," Oh, yeah. It's an extremely competitive, cutthroat sport.",3,Big Bang Theory,58,8
11003,Sheldon,6," Well, actually, the risk of throat cutting is very low. On the other hand, severe string burn is a real and ever-Present danger.",3,Big Bang Theory,129,23
11004,Leonard,6, You want to come watch?,3,Big Bang Theory,24,5
11005,Penny,6," Oh, gee, sounds amazing, but, um, I've got some friends coming over. Not a big thing, we're just gonna watch the Nebraska game.",3,Big Bang Theory,128,23
11006,Leonard,6," Oh. Football, sure.",3,Big Bang Theory,20,3
11007,Howard,6, Good guess.,3,Big Bang Theory,12,2
11008,Penny,6," I would've invited you, but I know you're not a football fan.",3,Big Bang Theory,62,12
11009,Leonard,6," No, no, I'm not, so, great. You've got plans doing something you like, I've got plans doing something I like, so it's good.",3,Big Bang Theory,124,23
11010,Penny,6," Well, maybe we'll hang out later, you know, after everybody's gone.",3,Big Bang Theory,68,11
11011,Leonard,6," Yeah, great.",3,Big Bang Theory,13,2
11012,Penny,6, See ya.,3,Big Bang Theory,8,2
11013,Leonard,6," Well, this sucks.",3,Big Bang Theory,18,3
11014,Sheldon,6," I'm sorry, I got bored and drifted off. Where exactly in the interaction did the sucking lie?",3,Big Bang Theory,94,17
11015,Raj,6," Leonard just realized that Penny's been hiding him from her friends because he's a tiny, little man who flies kites.",3,Big Bang Theory,117,20
11016,Sheldon,6," Oh, that certainly would suck.",3,Big Bang Theory,31,5
11018,Sheldon,6," Wolowitz is trying to outflank us. Let out some string, add altitude and I'll go under and cut his line.",3,Big Bang Theory,105,20
11019,Leonard,6, Why wouldn't Penny want her friends to meet me?,3,Big Bang Theory,48,9
11020,Sheldon,6," Focus, Leonard, focus! The heat of battle is upon us, the dogs of war are unleashed.",3,Big Bang Theory,85,16
11021,Leonard,6," Maybe Koothrappali's right, maybe I embarrass her.",3,Big Bang Theory,51,7
11022,Sheldon,6," You're embarrassing me right now, a grown man worrying about such nonsense when in the middle of flying kites.",3,Big Bang Theory,111,19
11023,Leonard,6, Sorry.,3,Big Bang Theory,7,1
11024,Sheldon,6, Sorry won't bring their kites down. Ow! String burn! String burn!,3,Big Bang Theory,66,11
11025,Raj,6," Oh, they think we're flanking, they're playing right into our hands. On the count of three, we execute the flying scissor. One, two",3,Big Bang Theory,132,23
11026,Howard,6, Whoa! Did you see that?,3,Big Bang Theory,24,5
11027,Raj,6, See what?,3,Big Bang Theory,10,2
11028,Howard,6," That chick, she smiled at me.",3,Big Bang Theory,30,6
11029,Raj,6," No, she didn't.",3,Big Bang Theory,16,3
11030,Howard,6," Yes, she did.",3,Big Bang Theory,14,3
11031,Raj,6," Come on, scissors, scissors!",3,Big Bang Theory,29,4
11032,Howard,6, Hold my line.,3,Big Bang Theory,14,3
11033,Raj,6," Wait, what are you doing? I can't scissors by myself! Howard! Come back!",3,Big Bang Theory,73,13
11034,Sheldon,6, Victory!,3,Big Bang Theory,9,1
11035,Raj,6, Son of a bitch.,3,Big Bang Theory,16,4
11037,Raj,6," You're a sucky friend, you know that? A sucky, sucky friend.",3,Big Bang Theory,61,11
11038,Howard,6, What was I supposed to do? She gave me that come-hither look.,3,Big Bang Theory,62,12
11039,Raj,6, If she gave you any look at l. It was a you suck look.,3,Big Bang Theory,55,14
11040,Howard,6, I would've caught up to her if I hadn't pulled a hammy.,3,Big Bang Theory,56,12
11041,Raj,6," Oh, please, you weigh 80 pounds. You don't have a hammy.",3,Big Bang Theory,57,11
11042,Leonard,6," So, Penny doesn't want me around her friends, I embarrass her. What else could it be?",3,Big Bang Theory,86,16
11043,Sheldon,6," Well, her actions could be out of concern for your feelings. Perhaps she's excluded you from these gatherings because she's scouting for a new mate and doesn't want to do it in front of you.",3,Big Bang Theory,191,35
11044,Leonard,6," Oh, how kind of her.",3,Big Bang Theory,21,5
11045,Sheldon,6, Agreed. Most primates don't show that sort of discretion. A female bonobo will copulate with a new male in front of the old one without so much as a how do you do?,3,Big Bang Theory,164,33
11046,Raj,6," You always do this, you know? You ditch me for a woman you don't have a shot with.",3,Big Bang Theory,83,18
11047,Howard,6, I totally had a shot.,3,Big Bang Theory,22,5
11048,Raj,6," With a woman you were chasing through a park? That's not a shot, that's a felony. What's worse, it cost me my prized Patang fighting kite. Sheldon, I don't suppose there's any chance you could give me my kite back?",3,Big Bang Theory,215,40
11049,Sheldon,6," I'm sorry, Raj, but the rules of aerial warfare dictate at the fallen kite go to the victor. And without rules, the competition has no meaning. And without meaning, the following would be an empty gesture.  I have your kite. I have your kite.",3,Big Bang Theory,243,44
11051,Leonard,6, Hey.,3,Big Bang Theory,5,1
11052,Penny,6, Hi.,3,Big Bang Theory,4,1
11053,Leonard,6, How was your football party?,3,Big Bang Theory,29,5
11054,Penny,6, It was pretty good. We won.,3,Big Bang Theory,28,6
11055,Leonard,6," Oh, that's excellent. It's a weird figure of speech, isn't it, we won when you weren't",3,Big Bang Theory,87,16
11056,Penny,6, I'm glad to hear it.,3,Big Bang Theory,21,5
11057,Leonard,6," Oh, hey, on a related subject, are you embarrassed to have me around your friends?",3,Big Bang Theory,83,15
11058,Penny,6," Oh, my god, no. Why would you ask that?",3,Big Bang Theory,40,9
11059,Leonard,6," Well, you know, I just noticed I haven't really met any of them.",3,Big Bang Theory,65,13
11060,Penny,6, Sure you have.,3,Big Bang Theory,15,3
11061,Leonard,6," Well, yeah, no, I met the huge ex-boyfriend and the smaller yet still larger than me ex-boyfriend. Were they here today?",3,Big Bang Theory,121,21
11062,Penny,6, Of course not.,3,Big Bang Theory,15,3
11063,Leonard,6, Of course not. Why would they be? Why would I ask? Why am I rambling? Why don't you stop me?,3,Big Bang Theory,93,20
11064,Penny,6," Leonard, look, if you want to meet my friends, that would be great. I just, you know, I didn't want you to be bored.",3,Big Bang Theory,117,24
11065,Leonard,6, I wouldn't be bored. Why would I be bored?,3,Big Bang Theory,43,9
11066,Penny,6," Well, 'cause they're not genius scientists.",3,Big Bang Theory,44,6
11067,Leonard,6," Penny, I like all sorts of people. In fact, some of my best friends aren't geniuses.",3,Big Bang Theory,85,16
11068,Penny,6, Like who?,3,Big Bang Theory,10,2
11069,Leonard,6," Okay, some of my Facebook friends aren't geniuses. My point is, if we're going to be a couple, I should be friends with your friends.",3,Big Bang Theory,134,25
11070,Penny,6," Okay, great. Well, then why don't you come over next Saturday and watch the game with us.",3,Big Bang Theory,90,17
11071,Leonard,6, Another football game?,3,Big Bang Theory,23,3
11072,Penny,6, They have them every week.,3,Big Bang Theory,27,5
11073,Leonard,6, Did not know that.,3,Big Bang Theory,19,4
11074,Penny,6, You wanted to meet my friends.,3,Big Bang Theory,31,6
11075,Leonard,6," Sure, sure, just I don't know much about football.",3,Big Bang Theory,51,9
11076,Penny,6," Oh, that's okay, a lot of the guys' girlfriends don't know football. They just kind of drink and talk in the kitchen.",3,Big Bang Theory,118,22
11077,Leonard,6, Great.,3,Big Bang Theory,7,1
11079,Leonard,6," Okay, a complete pass. First down, New England. I think I'm starting to get this.",3,Big Bang Theory,82,15
11080,Raj,6," Really? The only thing I've learned in the last two hours is that American men love drinking beer, pee too often and have trouble getting erections.",3,Big Bang Theory,149,26
11081,Leonard,6," Focus on the game, not the commercials, Raj.",3,Big Bang Theory,45,8
11082,Raj,6," I'm just saying, maybe if you people cut back on the beer, you could get out of the bathroom and satisfy your women without pharmaceutical help.",3,Big Bang Theory,145,26
11083,Howard,6," Raj, what are you doing here? You were supposed to help me pimp out my Vespa.",3,Big Bang Theory,78,16
11084,Raj,6," I'm sorry, are you under the impression that we're still friends?",3,Big Bang Theory,66,11
11085,Howard,6," Oh come on, you're not still grinding on the kite thing, are you?",3,Big Bang Theory,66,13
11086,Raj,6," It's not just the kite thing. Every time we go some place, you think you can just dump me whenever someone prettier comes along, even though you don't have a shot with them.",3,Big Bang Theory,174,33
11087,Howard,6, But I had a shot with that jogger.,3,Big Bang Theory,35,8
11088,Raj,6, Fine. Paint green flames on your little scooter with her. ,3,Big Bang Theory,59,10
11089,Howard,6, It's not a little scooter. It's the second biggest Vespa they make! Are you watching football?,3,Big Bang Theory,95,16
11090,Leonard,6," There's no fooling you. Now, what is this sacks statistic they put up there?",3,Big Bang Theory,77,14
11091,Howard,6," All I know about Saks is, my mother shops there.",3,Big Bang Theory,49,10
11092,Leonard,6," Sacks, sacks",3,Big Bang Theory,13,2
11093,Sheldon,6, It's football nomenclature for when a quarterback is tackled behind the line of scrimmage.,3,Big Bang Theory,91,14
11094,Leonard,6, Huh Scrimmage,3,Big Bang Theory,14,2
11095,Sheldon,6, The line of scrimmage is the imaginary transverse line separating the offence from the defence.,3,Big Bang Theory,96,15
11096,Leonard,6, Oh.,3,Big Bang Theory,4,1
11097,Howard,6, Sheldon knows football?,3,Big Bang Theory,24,3
11098,Leonard,6, Apparently.,3,Big Bang Theory,12,1
11099,Howard,6," I mean, Quidditch, sure. But football?",3,Big Bang Theory,39,6
11100,Leonard,6," Sheldon, how do you know this stuff?",3,Big Bang Theory,37,7
11101,Sheldon,6," I grew up in Texas. Football is ubiquitous in Texas. Pro football, college football, high school football, peewee football, in fact, every form of football except the original, European football, which most Texans believe to be a Commie plot.",3,Big Bang Theory,243,39
11102,Leonard,6, Unbelievable.,3,Big Bang Theory,14,1
11103,Sheldon,6," If you're interested, I also know all about frying meat that isn't chicken as if it were chicken.",3,Big Bang Theory,98,18
11104,Leonard,6, So you could teach me?,3,Big Bang Theory,23,5
11105,Sheldon,6, Football or chicken-fried meats?,3,Big Bang Theory,33,4
11106,Leonard,6, Football. I'm going to Penny's on Saturday to watch a game with her friends and I don't want to look like an idiot. I want to blend in.,3,Big Bang Theory,136,28
11107,Sheldon,6," If you want to blend in with Penny's friends, I'd think looking like an idiot would be the perfect camouflage.",3,Big Bang Theory,111,20
11108,Leonard,6," Come on, Sheldon, please teach me about football. It'll be fun.",3,Big Bang Theory,64,11
11109,Sheldon,6," That's exactly what my father said. Come to the games, watch the games, week in and week out from the time I was five until I went off to college. Longest seven years of my life.",3,Big Bang Theory,179,36
11110,Leonard,6," Please, I'm asking you as a friend.",3,Big Bang Theory,36,7
11111,Sheldon,6, Are you making this a tier one friendship request?,3,Big Bang Theory,51,9
11112,Leonard,6, Yes.,3,Big Bang Theory,5,1
11113,Sheldon,6, Fine.,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
11114,Leonard,6, I really appreciate this.,3,Big Bang Theory,26,4
11115,Sheldon,6," Yeah, yeah. All right, Poindexter, sit down, shut up and listen.",3,Big Bang Theory,65,11
11116,Leonard,6, I'm sorry?,3,Big Bang Theory,11,2
11117,Sheldon,6," That's how my father always began our football conversations. And if you'd like, after the game, I'll take you outside and teach you how to shoot close enough to a racoon that it craps itself.",3,Big Bang Theory,193,35
11119,Leonard,6, When are you going to stop making Cylon toast?,3,Big Bang Theory,47,9
11120,Sheldon,6, When I have enough to destroy all the human toast on the battlestar known as Galactica. Is that what you're wearing to watch football at Penny's?,3,Big Bang Theory,146,26
11121,Leonard,6, What's wrong with a football jersey?,3,Big Bang Theory,37,6
11122,Sheldon,6," Nothing. That, however, appears to be a football cocktail dress.",3,Big Bang Theory,65,10
11123,Leonard,6," I's the smallest size they had, except the one for dogs. I can't believe they had one for dogs.",3,Big Bang Theory,96,19
11124,Sheldon,6," Oh, yes. Canine football fans are a common sight in Texas. Cats, however, refuse to wear sporting apparel. My sister found that out the hard way.",3,Big Bang Theory,146,26
11125,Leonard,6," Anyway, wish me luck.",3,Big Bang Theory,22,4
11126,Sheldon,6," Leonard, wait. Am I correct in assuming that your attempt to be accepted by Penny's peers is based on your desire to ensure your continuing mating privileges with her?",3,Big Bang Theory,168,29
11127,Leonard,6," Well, I wouldn't put it exactly that way.",3,Big Bang Theory,42,8
11128,Sheldon,6, How would you put it?,3,Big Bang Theory,22,5
11129,Leonard,6," Yeah, okay, like you said.",3,Big Bang Theory,27,5
11130,Sheldon,6," Huh. Seems like an awful lot of trouble to go through for intercourse. Don't you have access to women who will do it for money? By the way, another accepted usage for the term ho.",3,Big Bang Theory,180,35
11131,Leonard,6," Good-Bye, Sheldon.",3,Big Bang Theory,19,2
11132,Sheldon,6, Hold on I believe that social convention dictate you not arrive empty-Handed. Would you like to bring some Cylon toast?,3,Big Bang Theory,120,20
11133,Leonard,6," Yeah, no, I'm trying to fit in, not get laughed at.",3,Big Bang Theory,52,11
11134,Sheldon,6, What's funny about Cylon toast?,3,Big Bang Theory,32,5
11136,Raj,6, It's open.,3,Big Bang Theory,11,2
11137,Howard,6," Hey, pal.",3,Big Bang Theory,10,2
11138,Raj,6, What do you want?,3,Big Bang Theory,18,4
11139,Howard,6, I brought you a little gift. New kite.,3,Big Bang Theory,39,8
11140,Raj,6," The kite you made me lose was an authentic Patang, an Indian fighting kite that my brother sent to me from New Delhi. It took me a day to put together and two days to paint. This is Hello Kitty.",3,Big Bang Theory,195,40
11141,Howard,6," Yeah, but it comes with a little coin purse. Does a Patang?",3,Big Bang Theory,60,12
11142,Raj,6," Wow, you just don't get it, do you? Buying me something pretty isn't going to make our problem just go away.",3,Big Bang Theory,109,21
11143,Howard,6," Look, I admit I haven't always been the best friend I could be.",3,Big Bang Theory,64,13
11144,Raj,6," You've been a sucky friend, a sucky, sucky friend.",3,Big Bang Theory,51,9
11145,Howard,6, Stipulated.,3,Big Bang Theory,12,1
11146,Raj,6," And you do it all the time. Last week in the mall at Radio Shack, we were looking for a phone with giant numbers for your mother, and I suddenly realize you're not even there.",3,Big Bang Theory,176,35
11147,Howard,6," I know, I know.",3,Big Bang Theory,16,4
11148,Raj,6, And where were you?,3,Big Bang Theory,20,4
11149,Howard,6," Getting shot down by the girl at Hot Dog on a Stick. But in my defence, she was gorgeous, and working that squeezer to make the lemonade, going up and down and up and down. It was like a free pole dance right in the middle of the food court.",3,Big Bang Theory,242,50
11150,Raj,6, You're impossible.,3,Big Bang Theory,19,2
11151,Howard,6," Hey, at least I can talk to women without being drunk.",3,Big Bang Theory,55,11
11152,Raj,6," Excuse me, I have selective mutism, a recognized medical disorder. You're just a douche.",3,Big Bang Theory,89,14
11153,Howard,6," No. You know what? Maybe that's what this whole thing's about. You're not mad at me, you're mad at yourself.",3,Big Bang Theory,109,20
11154,Raj,6," No, I'm mad at you. I hate myself, but I'm mad at you.",3,Big Bang Theory,55,13
11155,Howard,6," Fine. You're mad at me. I get it. Now, how about we go spend the day together? Just the two of us. We'll go anywhere you want.",3,Big Bang Theory,127,27
11156,Raj,6, I don't know.,3,Big Bang Theory,14,3
11157,Howard,6, Come on. Let me take you someplace nice.,3,Big Bang Theory,41,8
11158,Raj,6, I I do enjoy the La Brea Tar Pits.,3,Big Bang Theory,35,9
11159,Howard,6," Really, now? With the traffic and the parking, it's okay, fine. The Tar Pits. Let's go.",3,Big Bang Theory,88,16
11160,Raj,6," Oh, why can't I stay mad at you?",3,Big Bang Theory,33,8
11162,Leonard,6, Go! Go! Go! Go-Go-Go-Go! Yes! Are you people watching this? Is this amazing or what?,3,Big Bang Theory,85,15
11163,Penny,6," Sweetie, that's a highlight from the '98 championship game.",3,Big Bang Theory,60,9
11164,Leonard,6, Oh. Did not know that.,3,Big Bang Theory,23,5
11165,Penny,6, How much beer have you had?,3,Big Bang Theory,28,6
11166,Leonard,6," None, why?",3,Big Bang Theory,11,2
11167,Penny,6, Oh. I was just kind of hoping you were drunk. Now we're back live.,3,Big Bang Theory,67,14
11168,Leonard,6," Okay, yeah. I can see the difference.",3,Big Bang Theory,38,7
11171,Leonard,6," That completely was a forward pass, which they threw intentionally incomplete to avoid loss of yardage or to conserve time. I can't believe they're not being penalized with the loss of a down and by having to move the line of scrimmage back to the spot of the foul.",3,Big Bang Theory,266,49
11172,Penny,6," Here, have some pizza, sweetie.",3,Big Bang Theory,32,5
11173,Leonard,6," Penny, you know I'm lactose intolerant.",3,Big Bang Theory,40,6
11174,Penny,6, I know. I just need you stop talking.,3,Big Bang Theory,38,8
11175,Sheldon,6,  Penny.  Penny.  Penny.,3,Big Bang Theory,24,3
11176,Penny,6," Sheldon, come in.",3,Big Bang Theory,18,3
11177,Sheldon,6," Thank you. I'd like to make a sandwich, but I'm out of bread.",3,Big Bang Theory,62,13
11178,Penny,6, There's some in the fridge.,3,Big Bang Theory,28,5
11179,Sheldon,6," You shouldn't keep your bread in the refrigerator. Staleness is caused by crystallization of the starch molecules, which occurs faster at cool temperatures.",3,Big Bang Theory,157,23
11180,Penny,6," On Earth, we say thank you.",3,Big Bang Theory,28,6
11181,Sheldon,6," So Leonard, how goes the mimesis?",3,Big Bang Theory,34,6
11182,Leonard,6, Mimesis?,3,Big Bang Theory,9,1
11183,Sheldon,6, You know. Mimesis. An action in which the mimic takes on the properties of a specific object or organism. Mimesis.,3,Big Bang Theory,115,20
11184,Leonard,6, What the hell are you talking about?,3,Big Bang Theory,37,7
11185,Sheldon,6," I'm attempting to communicate with you without my meaning becoming apparent to those around you. Let me try again. Have the indigenous fauna accepted you as one of their own? Nudge, nudge, wink, wink.",3,Big Bang Theory,201,34
11186,Leonard,6," Oh, I guess so.",3,Big Bang Theory,16,4
11187,Sheldon,6," Good. Oh, FYI. After I eat my sandwich, I'm taking Koothrappali's Patang kite out for a test run. Would you like to get your delta-wing raptor and join me?",3,Big Bang Theory,156,29
11188,Leonard,6," I don't want to fly kites, Sheldon. We're watching football here.",3,Big Bang Theory,66,11
11189,Sheldon,6, I can see that. I was providing you with an alternative. A courtesy I was never offered in similar circumstances.,3,Big Bang Theory,114,20
11190,Leonard,6," Oh, look at that. The Oklahoma coach has thrown down a red flag indicating he's challenging the ruling on the field. I hope he's right, 'cause if he's not, it'll cost him one of his three time-Outs.",3,Big Bang Theory,199,37
11191,Penny,6," You know, Leonard, honey, I wouldn't mind if you wanted to go fly kites with Sheldon.",3,Big Bang Theory,86,16
11192,Leonard,6," No, I'll watch the end of the game. Besides, there's only three minutes left.",3,Big Bang Theory,78,14
11193,Penny,6, Until half time.,3,Big Bang Theory,17,3
11194,Leonard,6, This is just half? We've been here for hours.,3,Big Bang Theory,46,9
11195,Penny,6, And you're gonna be here for a couple more.,3,Big Bang Theory,44,9
11196,Leonard,6," Oh, you're kidding me.",3,Big Bang Theory,23,4
11197,Penny,6, No.,3,Big Bang Theory,4,1
11198,Leonard,6, Nice meeting all of you.,3,Big Bang Theory,25,5
11199,Penny,6," So, yeah, anyway, that's my boyfriend. He is really smart.",3,Big Bang Theory,59,10
11201,Raj,6, I really like my saber-toothed cat. Thank you.,3,Big Bang Theory,47,8
11202,Howard,6," My pleasure. Maybe after lunch, we can go to Marie Callender's and have some pie.",3,Big Bang Theory,82,15
11203,Raj,6, I'd like that. This is turning out to be a perfect Saturday.,3,Big Bang Theory,61,12
11204,Howard,6," Good. I'm glad. Oh, man. Did you see the way she smiled at me?",3,Big Bang Theory,63,14
11205,Raj,6, Fine. Go ahead.,3,Big Bang Theory,16,3
11206,Howard,6, No. This is our day.,3,Big Bang Theory,21,5
11207,Raj,6," If you want to chase after her, chase after her.",3,Big Bang Theory,49,10
11208,Howard,6," Ah, who am I kidding? I wouldn't have a shot with a girl like that.",3,Big Bang Theory,68,15
11209,Raj,6, Don't put yourself down. You're a very attractive man.,3,Big Bang Theory,55,9
11210,Howard,6, You think so?,3,Big Bang Theory,14,3
11211,Raj,6," Yeah. Absolutely. It wouldn't kill you to take a Pilates class with me now and then, but you have a certain wiry appeal.",3,Big Bang Theory,121,23
11212,Howard,6," Yeah, well, it doesn't matter â€˜cause she wasn't really smiling at me.",3,Big Bang Theory,72,12
11213,Raj,6," Actually, in this case, I think she was.",3,Big Bang Theory,41,8
11214,Howard,6, Really?,3,Big Bang Theory,8,1
11215,Raj,6, Yeah.,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
11216,Howard,6, Bye.,3,Big Bang Theory,5,1
11217,Raj,6, What a douche.,3,Big Bang Theory,15,3
11219,Penny,7," Wow, Sheldon, I cannot believe you made up your own game.",3,Big Bang Theory,58,11
11220,Sheldon,7," Oh, Research Lab is more than a game. It's like the slogan says, the physics is theoretical, but the fun is real.",3,Big Bang Theory,114,22
11221,Leonard,7, We must not be playing it right.,3,Big Bang Theory,33,7
11222,Penny,7," All right, five. One, two, three, four, five. Oh, wow, look at that, my Department of Defence research grant is renewed.",3,Big Bang Theory,121,21
11223,Sheldon,7, Oh! Great roll! Now you can demolish your Soviet-style cyclotron and build the large Hadron Collider.,3,Big Bang Theory,102,16
11224,Penny,7, Yay.,3,Big Bang Theory,5,1
11225,Sheldon,7," You're a natural at this, Penny. And as the first beta testers, you two'll have quite the edge when we play with Wolowitz and Koothrappali on Sunday.",3,Big Bang Theory,150,27
11226,Leonard,7," Oh, gee, Sheldon, I don't think we can play on Sunday.",3,Big Bang Theory,55,11
11227,Sheldon,7, Why not?,3,Big Bang Theory,9,2
11228,Leonard,7, Because of the reasons that Penny will now tell you. Penny?,3,Big Bang Theory,60,11
11229,Penny,7," Actually, I have to pick up my friend Justin from the airport.",3,Big Bang Theory,63,12
11230,Leonard,7," There you go, she has to pick up her friend Justin at the airport, aAnd I can't play 'cause I'm going with her, right?",3,Big Bang Theory,119,24
11231,Penny,7," Um, yeah, if you want. I mean, there may not be room. He's got a lot of stuff, like guitars and amplifiers.",3,Big Bang Theory,108,22
11232,Leonard,7, Wait. What are you talking about?,3,Big Bang Theory,34,6
11233,Penny,7," My friend, Justin.",3,Big Bang Theory,19,3
11234,Sheldon,7," Pay attention, Leonard. That's why she can't play on Sunday.",3,Big Bang Theory,61,10
11235,Leonard,7, Who is this Justin?,3,Big Bang Theory,20,4
11236,Sheldon,7," Your turn, Leonard.",3,Big Bang Theory,20,3
11237,Penny,7, I told you about him.,3,Big Bang Theory,22,5
11238,Leonard,7," No, you didn't.",3,Big Bang Theory,16,3
11239,Sheldon,7," Roll the dice, Leonard.",3,Big Bang Theory,24,4
11240,Penny,7," Yeah, my friend from Omaha, plays the guitar. Anyway, he's coming to L.A. looking for some session work, so I told him he could just crash on my couch for a few weeks.",3,Big Bang Theory,168,33
11241,Sheldon,7," Come on, Leonard, if you roll a six, Penny dies horribly in a nuclear meltdown. See what I mean when I say the fun is real?",3,Big Bang Theory,124,26
11242,Leonard,7, Hang on. Some guy is going to be sleeping on your couch?,3,Big Bang Theory,57,12
11243,Penny,7, He's not some guy. He's my friend.,3,Big Bang Theory,35,7
11244,Leonard,7," So by friend, do you mean friend friend, gay friend, or ex boyfriend who you're now platonic with but still might have a thing for you friendâ€ù?",3,Big Bang Theory,146,27
11245,Penny,7," Well, he's definitely not gay.",3,Big Bang Theory,31,5
11246,Leonard,7," Oh, a definitely not gay musician sleeping on my girlfriend's couch. Yippee.",3,Big Bang Theory,77,12
11247,Penny,7," Okay, we went out a little bit, a long time ago, but we were never like going out.",3,Big Bang Theory,83,18
11248,Leonard,7," Okay, not to be pedantic, but the last I checked went out was in fact the past tense of going out, which I think we all know is a popular euphemism for saw each other naked.",3,Big Bang Theory,174,36
11249,Sheldon,7, I'll just roll for you.,3,Big Bang Theory,24,5
11250,Penny,7, Do you have a problem with Justin staying with me?,3,Big Bang Theory,51,10
11251,Leonard,7, What was your first clue?,3,Big Bang Theory,26,5
11252,Sheldon,7, Uh-oh! Industrial accident.,3,Big Bang Theory,28,3
11253,Penny,7, You know what? Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot.,3,Big Bang Theory,51,11
11254,Leonard,7, I'm not talking to you like you're an idiot! I'm saying the whole idea is idiotic!,3,Big Bang Theory,83,16
11255,Sheldon,7, You accidentally stare at a helium-argon laser. Lose one turn and a retina.,3,Big Bang Theory,76,13
11256,Penny,7," How is that not talking to me like I'm an idiot? It's my friend, it's my couch, and it's my freakin' life!",3,Big Bang Theory,107,22
11257,Sheldon,7, It's also your roll.,3,Big Bang Theory,21,4
11258,Leonard,7," You know what? It is your life. If you want to have some stupid guitarist stay on your couch, then fine. Why don't you just rent some bunk beds and invite The Black Eyed Peas?",3,Big Bang Theory,176,35
11259,Penny,7," Hey, if I want to invite the entire line up of Lollapalooza to sleep in my apartment, I will, and it's none of your business!",3,Big Bang Theory,126,25
11260,Leonard,7, Are you listening to yourself? Do you know how childish you sound right now?,3,Big Bang Theory,77,14
11261,Penny,7," Oh, now I'm a child? Well, at least I'm not an idiot anymore!",3,Big Bang Theory,62,13
11262,Leonard,7, The two aren't mutually exclusive!,3,Big Bang Theory,35,5
11263,Penny,7," Oh, you are such a  What the hell is he doing?",3,Big Bang Theory,47,11
11264,Leonard,7, He's drowning us out. He doesn't like fighting.,3,Big Bang Theory,48,8
11265,Penny,7," Sheldon, just stop, look, the fight is over. Oh, and FYI, you never even heard of The Black Eyed Peas until you met me!",3,Big Bang Theory,120,24
11266,Leonard,7," I heard of 'em. Didn't know they were a band. Sheldon, she's gone. You can turn off the blender.",3,Big Bang Theory,97,19
11267,Sheldon,7, Has your relationship reached its inevitable ugly end?,3,Big Bang Theory,55,8
11268,Leonard,7," No, we just had a little spat.",3,Big Bang Theory,31,7
11269,Sheldon,7," Look on the bright side. As the result of Penny's forfeit, you have become the world's first winner of Research Lab. Would you like a commemorative snow cone?",3,Big Bang Theory,159,28
11271,Leonard,7, I don't get how she can just announce that an old boyfriend is going to be sleeping on her couch.,3,Big Bang Theory,98,20
11272,Sheldon,7," Hey, I thought of a game we can play in the car.",3,Big Bang Theory,49,12
11273,Leonard,7," I don't want to play a game, Sheldon.",3,Big Bang Theory,38,8
11274,Sheldon,7," It's called Scientists. Now, I will name three scientists, then you will put them in order of the size of their contribution to their respective fields. To make this game even more compelling, you must consider only the contribution of the man to the field, not the validity of the field itself. For example, Abu Musa Jabir ibn Hayn made a greater contribution to the discredited field of alchemy than Halbert Vanderplatt made to neurobiology. Okay, ready to have some fun?",3,Big Bang Theory,474,81
11275,Leonard,7," An old boyfriend who's definitely not gay. That's what a guy likes to hear, definitely.",3,Big Bang Theory,88,15
11276,Sheldon,7," All right, I'll start with an easy one, um, Isaac Newton, Madame Curie and Niels Bohr.",3,Big Bang Theory,87,16
11277,Leonard,7, And then I say one little thing and I end up being the bad guy!,3,Big Bang Theory,64,15
11278,Sheldon,7," Hint, Madame Curie had her husband to help her.",3,Big Bang Theory,48,9
11279,Leonard,7," What am I supposed to say? Sure, Penny, I'm cool with your old boyfriend sleeping in your apartment. Well, Leonard, it doesn't matter if you're cool or not because I'm Penny and I'm pretty and I can do whatever the hell I want! Oh, I get it! You think you're doing me a favour just by being in a relationship with me! No, no, Leonard! I'm doing you a favour just by being in the same room as you!",3,Big Bang Theory,397,79
11280,Sheldon,7, Leonard! Stop the car!,3,Big Bang Theory,23,4
11281,Leonard,7, What?,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
11282,Sheldon,7, I can't listen to the two of you fight anymore.,3,Big Bang Theory,48,10
11284,Sheldon,7," Come on, come on, we're late.",3,Big Bang Theory,30,6
11285,Leonard,7," Calm down, we'll make the movie.",3,Big Bang Theory,33,6
11286,Sheldon,7," I believe my alarm is appropriate, given the situation. The movie starts in 17 minutes, which means we'll need to make all the lights on Colorado Boulevard, plus skip the concession stand, and preshow urination.",3,Big Bang Theory,212,35
11287,Raj,7," Oh, dude, I wish you had said something before I pounded that last Red Bull.",3,Big Bang Theory,77,15
11288,Sheldon,7," Go, go, Power Rangers, go!",3,Big Bang Theory,27,5
11289,Penny,7, Hey.,3,Big Bang Theory,5,1
11290,Leonard,7," Hey. We're, uh, going to the movies.",3,Big Bang Theory,37,7
11291,Sheldon,7," No, we're not. We're standing in the hallway, suffering through an awkward encounter.",3,Big Bang Theory,86,13
11292,Leonard,7," Hang on. They're showing a new digital print of Time Bandits, you wouldn't want to come, would you?",3,Big Bang Theory,100,18
11293,Penny,7," Not really, no.",3,Big Bang Theory,16,3
11294,Sheldon,7," All right, invitation pointlessly offered, invitation declined as expected, everyone's civil, nobody's fighting. Have a nice evening.",3,Big Bang Theory,134,17
11295,Leonard,7, Just give us a minute.,3,Big Bang Theory,23,5
11296,Howard,7," Oh, take all the time you need.",3,Big Bang Theory,32,7
11297,Leonard,7," So, are we going to talk about last night?",3,Big Bang Theory,43,9
11298,Penny,7, Are you ready to apologize?,3,Big Bang Theory,28,5
11299,Leonard,7, No.,3,Big Bang Theory,4,1
11300,Penny,7," E-e-e-e-eh! Wrong answer, but thank you for playing.",3,Big Bang Theory,53,8
11301,Leonard,7," Oh, come on. This is stupid.",3,Big Bang Theory,29,6
11302,Penny,7," Oh, there it is again! You think I'm stupid!",3,Big Bang Theory,45,9
11303,Leonard,7," No, there's a difference between being stupid and acting stupid.",3,Big Bang Theory,65,10
11304,Penny,7," Oh, yeah? well, there's a difference between being a jerk and being an ass!",3,Big Bang Theory,76,14
11305,Leonard,7," No, there isn't! They're synonyms!",3,Big Bang Theory,35,5
11306,Raj,7," Well, that was rather unpleasant.",3,Big Bang Theory,34,5
11307,Howard,7," Yeah, I don't think I need my preshow urination anymore.",3,Big Bang Theory,57,10
11308,Sheldon,7," Leonard, when that woman moved in three years ago I told you not to talk to her, and now look, we're going to be late for the movies.",3,Big Bang Theory,134,28
11310,Howard,7, Hey! Look! Amazing Spider-Man 183.,3,Big Bang Theory,35,5
11311,Sheldon,7, Got it.,3,Big Bang Theory,8,2
11312,Howard,7, Remember this one? Spider-Man loses a big fight and then his girlfriend breaks up with him. Want me to get it for you? It'll help take your mind off things.,3,Big Bang Theory,157,30
11314,Leonard,7," Oh, we need to kill a couple hours till the next showing of Time Bandits.",3,Big Bang Theory,74,15
11316,Leonard,7," Thanks, Stuart. Let me ask you something. Do you think it's okay for Penny to have an ex-boyfriend sleep on her couch?",3,Big Bang Theory,119,22
11317,Howard,7," No, I mean, she's obviously way out of line.",3,Big Bang Theory,45,9
11318,Leonard,7, Thank you!,3,Big Bang Theory,11,2
11319,Howard,7," But if she dumps you, she'll have a new boyfriend by tomorrow morning and you'll have a new girlfriend when you figure out how to build one. So the only question is, how long until you fold?",3,Big Bang Theory,191,37
11320,Leonard,7, I am not going to fold.,3,Big Bang Theory,24,6
11321,Raj,7," Well, excuse me, I don't think Penny's out of line at all. You don't own her. It's like my girl, Beyonce says, if you like it, you shoulda put a ring on it.â€ù",3,Big Bang Theory,160,33
11322,Howard,7," Come on. At the very least, when she found out Leonard was upset about it, she should've backed off.",3,Big Bang Theory,101,19
11323,Raj,7, You mean like when a guy's upset because his friend agreed to take a cooking class with him and then doesn't show up because he's doing a juice fast with his mother?,3,Big Bang Theory,166,32
11324,Howard,7, I didn't know you were upset about that.,3,Big Bang Theory,41,8
11325,Raj,7," Really! Did you miss all the subtle indicators, like me saying, Howard, I am upset.",3,Big Bang Theory,84,15
11326,Howard,7," Okay, sorry.",3,Big Bang Theory,13,2
11327,Raj,7," Maybe it means something different in this country. Back in India, it means you're upset with a guy named Howard!",3,Big Bang Theory,114,20
11328,Howard,7, I said I'm sorry.,3,Big Bang Theory,18,4
11329,Raj,7, Sorry doesn't make up for the fact that I had to make chicken and rice with this vegan guy. Do you know what vegan chicken and rice is? Rice!,3,Big Bang Theory,142,29
11330,Howard,7," Yeah, well, you think I was having fun, sitting around all night listening to my mother say â€œHave you ever peed so much in your life?â€ù",3,Big Bang Theory,139,26
11331,Raj,7," Oh, my God, you are such a mama's boy.",3,Big Bang Theory,39,9
11332,Howard,7," Hey, don't bring my mother into this!",3,Big Bang Theory,38,7
11333,Raj,7, You brought your mother into this!,3,Big Bang Theory,35,6
11334,Sheldon,7," Stop it, both of you. All this fighting, I might as well be back with my parents! Damn it, George, I told you if you didn't quit drinkin' I'd leave you! Well, I guess that makes you a liar, 'cause I'm drunk as hell and you're still here! Stop yelling! You're making Sheldon cry! I'll tell you what's making Sheldon cry! That I let you name him Sheldon.",3,Big Bang Theory,353,68
11335,Howard,7," Boy, what got him so upset?",3,Big Bang Theory,28,6
11336,Raj,7," Oh, sure, you can tell when Sheldon's upset.",3,Big Bang Theory,45,8
11338,Penny,7," Oh, thank you very much. Come back soon. With the other half of my tip. Hey, Sheldon, what are you doing here?",3,Big Bang Theory,111,22
11339,Sheldon,7," This is a restaurant. It's lunchtime. I would think, as a waitress, you'd be familiar with the paradigm.",3,Big Bang Theory,105,18
11340,Penny,7, Is Leonard coming?,3,Big Bang Theory,19,3
11341,Sheldon,7," No, I believe Leonard is waiting for you to come crawling back to him and apologize.",3,Big Bang Theory,85,16
11342,Penny,7," Well, that's not gonna happen.",3,Big Bang Theory,31,5
11343,Sheldon,7," I assumed that would be your attitude. Hence, my true purpose in coming here.",3,Big Bang Theory,78,14
11344,Penny,7, Which is?,3,Big Bang Theory,10,2
11345,Sheldon,7, I want you to crawl back to him and apologize.,3,Big Bang Theory,47,10
11346,Penny,7, I'm busy.,3,Big Bang Theory,10,2
11347,Sheldon,7," Excuse me, miss. I'd like to order lunch.",3,Big Bang Theory,42,8
11348,Penny,7, Fine. What do you want?,3,Big Bang Theory,24,5
11349,Sheldon,7," I have a few questions. First, I notice that you offer soup and a half-sandwich?",3,Big Bang Theory,81,15
11350,Penny,7, Yes.,3,Big Bang Theory,5,1
11351,Sheldon,7," Where exactly does the half-sandwich come from? Are you giving me half of someone else's sandwich, or do I have to wait for someone else in the restaurant to order the other half?",3,Big Bang Theory,180,33
11352,Penny,7," No, no, Sheldon, they just make a half-sandwich.",3,Big Bang Theory,49,8
11353,Sheldon,7," You can't make a half-sandwich. If it's not half of a whole sandwich, it's just a small sandwich.",3,Big Bang Theory,98,18
11354,Penny,7," Okay, fine, it's soup and a small sandwich. Is that what you want?",3,Big Bang Theory,67,13
11355,Sheldon,7, Of course not. I'll have my usual.,3,Big Bang Theory,35,7
11356,Penny,7, Great.,3,Big Bang Theory,7,1
11357,Sheldon,7, Aren't you going to ask me if I want a beverage?,3,Big Bang Theory,49,11
11358,Penny,7, Don't you usually get lemonade?,3,Big Bang Theory,32,5
11359,Sheldon,7, Yes.,3,Big Bang Theory,5,1
11360,Penny,7, Do you want lemonade?,3,Big Bang Theory,22,4
11361,Sheldon,7, Yes.,3,Big Bang Theory,5,1
11362,Penny,7, Anything else?,3,Big Bang Theory,15,2
11363,Sheldon,7," Yes, I want you to apologize to Leonard.",3,Big Bang Theory,41,8
11364,Penny,7, I am not going to apologize. I've done nothing wrong. He is completely overreacting.,3,Big Bang Theory,85,14
11365,Sheldon,7, Irrelevant. The disruption in your relationship is making my life intolerable.,3,Big Bang Theory,79,11
11366,Penny,7," Well, I'm sorry, Sheldon, but this really isn't about you.",3,Big Bang Theory,59,10
11367,Sheldon,7, I don't follow.,3,Big Bang Theory,16,3
11368,Penny,7," Yeah, yeah, I'll be right there. Look, Sheldon, I have to go.",3,Big Bang Theory,62,12
11369,Sheldon,7," All right, let's assume, ad argumentum, that in this case, Leonard is wrong.",3,Big Bang Theory,77,13
11370,Penny,7, Leonard is wrong.,3,Big Bang Theory,18,3
11371,Sheldon,7," Considering the number of transgressions you've committed that he's overlooked, don't you think that, just this once, you could return the favour?",3,Big Bang Theory,147,22
11372,Penny,7," I'm coming. Goodbye, Sheldon. What do you mean, transgressions I've committed?",3,Big Bang Theory,79,11
11373,Sheldon,7, Were you under the impression that Leonard has no complaints about you?,3,Big Bang Theory,72,12
11374,Penny,7," Like what? Yeah, yeah, I see you, you're making a little cheque sign in the air, I got it, just hold your horses. What does Leonard complain about?",3,Big Bang Theory,148,28
11375,Sheldon,7," Your driving, the plethora of stuffed animals on your bed that stare at him during your amorous activities, your constant tardiness, your singing.",3,Big Bang Theory,147,23
11376,Penny,7, My singing?,3,Big Bang Theory,12,2
11377,Sheldon,7," That's actually from my list, but Leonard would be a fool if he didn't agree with it.",3,Big Bang Theory,86,17
11378,Penny,7," Okay, if Leonard has so many problems with me, why hasn't he just said so?",3,Big Bang Theory,75,15
11379,Sheldon,7," Because, according to him, you're oversensitive and have a temper.",3,Big Bang Theory,67,10
11380,Penny,7," Oh, really? Well, then, do me a favour and tell Leonard that he can drop dead!",3,Big Bang Theory,79,16
11381,Sheldon,7, And she wonders why she's constantly undertipped.,3,Big Bang Theory,50,7
11383,Leonard,7, Hey.,3,Big Bang Theory,5,1
11384,Sheldon,7," Oh, good, you're home. I need you to do me a favour.",3,Big Bang Theory,53,12
11385,Leonard,7, Sure.,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
11386,Sheldon,7, Go apologize to Penny.,3,Big Bang Theory,23,4
11387,Leonard,7, What?,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
11388,Sheldon,7, Right now would be good.,3,Big Bang Theory,25,5
11389,Penny,7, Leonard!,3,Big Bang Theory,9,1
11390,Sheldon,7," Although, a few minutes ago would have been better.",3,Big Bang Theory,52,9
11391,Penny,7," I hear you don't like my stuffed animals, my driving or my punctuality.",3,Big Bang Theory,72,13
11392,Leonard,7, What? Who would tell you something like that? Why would you tell her something like that?,3,Big Bang Theory,90,16
11393,Penny,7," It doesn't matter why he told me. It's true, isn't it?",3,Big Bang Theory,55,11
11394,Leonard,7," Okay, yeah, it's true, but I can live with that stuff. What I can't live with is you casually informing me that some guy's going to be staying in your apartment without even asking me first!",3,Big Bang Theory,191,36
11395,Penny,7," That isn't even your problem, the problem is you don't trust me!",3,Big Bang Theory,65,12
11396,Leonard,7," Oh, come on. Sheldon, have you ever once heard me say that I don't trust Penny? Sheldon? Where did he go?",3,Big Bang Theory,106,21
11397,Penny,7," Oh, your yelling must have freaked him out again.",3,Big Bang Theory,50,9
11398,Leonard,7, Where are you going? You just walk away in the middle of an argument?!,3,Big Bang Theory,71,14
11399,Penny,7," No, I'm going to go find your damn roommate before he hurts himself trying to cross the street or something!",3,Big Bang Theory,109,20
11400,Leonard,7, Why didn't you say so?,3,Big Bang Theory,23,5
11401,Penny,7," Oh, now I need your permission for that, too?!",3,Big Bang Theory,47,9
11402,Leonard,7," Well, I can't read your mind, Penny!",3,Big Bang Theory,37,7
11403,Penny,7," Really? Why not? You're so smart, and I'm so dumb!",3,Big Bang Theory,51,10
11405,Sheldon,7,  Raj.  Raj.  Raj.,3,Big Bang Theory,18,3
11406,Raj,7," Stop knocking! It's open! Please tell my parents that our dark matter research is at a critical juncture, and I can't come home for my cousin Sanjay's wedding.",3,Big Bang Theory,160,28
11408,Raj,7, I didn't ask you to set me up with Lakshmi.,3,Big Bang Theory,44,10
11411,Raj,7, I don't care! And why don't you think I can find a woman for myself?,3,Big Bang Theory,69,15
11413,Raj,7," Oh, that is completely below the belt. Sheldon, tell my parents that Howard and I are just friends. Sheldon? Howard and I are just friends! Fine. I'll come home for Sanjay's wedding.",3,Big Bang Theory,183,32
11415,Penny,7, Sheldon!  ,3,Big Bang Theory,11,1
11416,Leonard,7, What are you doing? He's not a lost dog.,3,Big Bang Theory,41,9
11417,Penny,7," Hey, why don't you just let me find him while you sit there hitting your imaginary brake?",3,Big Bang Theory,90,17
11418,Leonard,7," The brake might be imaginary, but that stop sign you just ran wasn't.",3,Big Bang Theory,70,13
11419,Penny,7, What stop sign?,3,Big Bang Theory,16,3
11420,Leonard,7, Eyes on the road. Eyes on the road!,3,Big Bang Theory,36,8
11423,Howard,7," I'm busy too, you answer it.",3,Big Bang Theory,29,6
11425,Howard,7," For God's sake, I don't need to hear that! Can't you just say, I'm busy?",3,Big Bang Theory,73,15
11427,Howard,7," You know what? I hope it's one of those home invasion deals, and they shoot me in the head.",3,Big Bang Theory,92,19
11429,Howard,7," There's no one there. You're hearing things, you crazy old lady!",3,Big Bang Theory,65,11
11431,Leonard,7," Hey, Stuart, have you seen Sheldon?",3,Big Bang Theory,36,6
11433,Leonard,7, Thank you.,3,Big Bang Theory,11,2
11435,Penny,7, Yeah?,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
11437,Penny,7, What do you mean?,3,Big Bang Theory,18,4
11439,Penny,7," Oh, yeah, kind of. It's, it's no big thing.",3,Big Bang Theory,44,9
11441,Leonard,7, I'm not leaving until you talk to me.,3,Big Bang Theory,38,8
11442,Penny,7," All right, what's going on?",3,Big Bang Theory,28,5
11443,Leonard,7," It's a little hard to explain. He does this thing where he pretends he's in an alternate dimension that occupies the same physical space we're in, but he can't perceive us.",3,Big Bang Theory,173,31
11444,Sheldon,7, Don't flatter yourself. I'm just ignoring you.,3,Big Bang Theory,47,7
11445,Penny,7," Come on, Sheldon, let's go home. Look, we're done fighting.",3,Big Bang Theory,60,10
11446,Sheldon,7," I've heard that before, but then, the next thing you know I'm hiding in my bedroom, blaring a Richard Feinman lecture while my mom is shouting that Jesus would forgive her if she put ground glass in my dad's meatloaf, and my dad's on the roof skeet-shooting her Franklin Mint collectible plates.",3,Big Bang Theory,296,52
11447,Penny,7," Okay, there's going to no more shouting and no skeet-shooting.",3,Big Bang Theory,63,10
11448,Sheldon,7, Really? Where's your friend Justin going to sleep?,3,Big Bang Theory,51,8
11449,Leonard,7," Yeah, where's he gonna sleep?",3,Big Bang Theory,30,5
11450,Penny,7," Oh, my God, would you let this go?!",3,Big Bang Theory,36,8
11452,Leonard,7," Why should I let it go? Why don't you just tell the guy to find another place to sleep?  Oh, for God's sakes. So, you have childhood issues, we all have childhood issues, at some point, you just need to grow up and get past them. ",3,Big Bang Theory,231,46
11453,Penny,7," Leonard, will you just let me handle this, please? Look, let's just Sheldon, please,",3,Big Bang Theory,85,14
11454,Leonard,7, Always is a long time. Sure. Always.,3,Big Bang Theory,37,7
11455,Penny,7," You know, how about we buy you this robot, and then we all go home?",3,Big Bang Theory,68,15
11456,Sheldon,7, I want that one.,3,Big Bang Theory,17,4
11457,Penny,7," Okay, you can have that one.",3,Big Bang Theory,29,6
11458,Leonard,7," Oh, come on, he's just going to play with it twice, and then it'll end up in his closet with all the other junk.",3,Big Bang Theory,113,24
11459,Penny,7," Buy him the robot, Leonard.",3,Big Bang Theory,28,5
11460,Sheldon,7," Can I get this comic book, too?",3,Big Bang Theory,32,7
11461,Penny,7," Yes, you can.",3,Big Bang Theory,14,3
11464,Leonard,7, So what did Justin say when you told him he couldn't sleep on your couch?,3,Big Bang Theory,74,15
11465,Penny,7," He's a musician. He'll sleep in his own vomit, if he has to.",3,Big Bang Theory,61,13
11467,Sheldon,7, I should have asked for much more than a comic book and a robot.,3,Big Bang Theory,65,14
11469,Howard,8, How much time do we have?,3,Big Bang Theory,26,6
11470,Leonard,8," Uh, t-minus five hours, 37 minutes to onset of meteor shower.",3,Big Bang Theory,62,11
11471,Raj,8," Okay, our position is 34.48 degrees north, 118.31 west. That means the azimuth should be 168.22 degrees relative to magnetic north with an elevation of 49.93.",3,Big Bang Theory,159,26
11472,Howard,8, Anything yet?,3,Big Bang Theory,14,2
11473,Leonard,8," Uh, we have a signal, but there's no frame lock.",3,Big Bang Theory,49,10
11474,Howard,8," Hang on, how about now?",3,Big Bang Theory,24,5
11475,Raj,8, We did it. We have the west coast feed of HBO.,3,Big Bang Theory,47,11
11476,Howard,8," Ooh, Real Sex.",3,Big Bang Theory,15,3
11477,Raj,8, Big deal. Every time I watch that show it's old women putting condoms on cucumbers.,3,Big Bang Theory,84,15
11478,Howard,8," Alright, let's see what's on the east coast feed.",3,Big Bang Theory,50,9
11479,Leonard,8," Oh, hey. Dune.",3,Big Bang Theory,15,3
11480,Raj,8," Not a great movie, but look at that beautiful desert.",3,Big Bang Theory,54,10
11481,Leonard,8, Too bad Sheldon couldn't come with us.,3,Big Bang Theory,39,7
11482,Raj,8," Yes, it's not the same without him. ",3,Big Bang Theory,37,7
11483,Howard,8," Oh, this sucks, I'm switching back to Real Sex.",3,Big Bang Theory,48,9
11485,Sheldon,8," Sheldon's log, stardate 63345.3. While my colleagues are off observing the Leonid meteor shower, I have remained behind to complete my paper on the decays of highly excited massive string states. Although my research is going well I do miss the warmth of human companionship. ",3,Big Bang Theory,277,45
11487,Sheldon,8," And good evening to you, Siam Palace. This is Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I'm going to be dining alone this evening, so I'll be reducing my usual order. I'd like to start with one quarter of the assorted appetizers plate and, uh, one half of the golden treasure for two. Oh, for heaven's sake, in the mid-18th century, King Rama IV of Siam divided a huge empire amongst the colonial powers of Europe in order to preserve his throne. Surely, you, his cultural descendant, can handle pad thai and dumplings.",3,Big Bang Theory,500,89
11488,Penny,8, Sheldon help!,3,Big Bang Theory,14,2
11489,Sheldon,8," I need to go, but you keep in mind that my sharply worded comments on yelp.com recently took down a local muffin store.  Penny.  Penny.  Penny..",3,Big Bang Theory,145,26
11490,Penny,8, Come in! Hurry!,3,Big Bang Theory,16,3
11491,Sheldon,8, Penny?,3,Big Bang Theory,7,1
11492,Penny,8, I'm back here.,3,Big Bang Theory,15,3
11493,Sheldon,8,  Penny.  Penny.  Penny..,3,Big Bang Theory,25,3
11494,Penny,8," Oh, for god's sakes, I'm in the bathroom!",3,Big Bang Theory,42,8
11495,Sheldon,8, Shall I come back at a better time?,3,Big Bang Theory,36,8
11496,Penny,8, Get in here! Hurry! Don't you dare knock.,3,Big Bang Theory,42,8
11497,Sheldon,8, Hello.,3,Big Bang Theory,7,1
11498,Penny,8," I slipped in the shower, and I think I dislocated my shoulder.",3,Big Bang Theory,63,12
11499,Sheldon,8, Not surprising. You have no safety mat or adhesive stickers to allow for purchase on a surface with a low coefficient of static friction.,3,Big Bang Theory,138,24
11500,Penny,8, What?,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
11501,Sheldon,8, Tubs are slippery.,3,Big Bang Theory,19,3
11502,Penny,8, I know. I slipped.,3,Big Bang Theory,19,4
11503,Sheldon,8, I have a series of whimsical duck stickers on the bottom of my tub.,3,Big Bang Theory,68,14
11504,Penny,8," Yeah, okay, whatever. Will you just turn the water off and help me up?",3,Big Bang Theory,71,14
11505,Sheldon,8, They're holding umbrellas.,3,Big Bang Theory,27,3
11506,Penny,8, What?,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
11507,Sheldon,8, The ducks in my tub.,3,Big Bang Theory,21,5
11508,Penny,8, Uh-huh.,3,Big Bang Theory,8,1
11509,Sheldon,8," They're whimsical because ducks have neither the need for, nor the ability to use umbrellas.",3,Big Bang Theory,93,15
11510,Penny,8," Oh, my god. I got to go to the emergency room.",3,Big Bang Theory,47,11
11511,Sheldon,8," Well, assuming you're correct that your right humerus is no longer seated in the glenoid socket, I would certainly think so.",3,Big Bang Theory,125,21
11512,Penny,8," Okay, can you drive me?",3,Big Bang Theory,24,5
11513,Sheldon,8, I don't drive.,3,Big Bang Theory,15,3
11514,Penny,8," Well, I can't drive!",3,Big Bang Theory,21,4
11515,Sheldon,8," Well, it seems we've reached an impasse.",3,Big Bang Theory,41,7
11516,Penny,8, Ow.,3,Big Bang Theory,4,1
11517,Sheldon,8, But I could call you a cab or an ambulance.,3,Big Bang Theory,44,10
11518,Penny,8," No, no, no, I can't wait that long, you got to help me, please.",3,Big Bang Theory,64,14
11519,Sheldon,8, All right. Let it never be said that Sheldon Lee Cooper ignored the pleas of a damsel in distress.,3,Big Bang Theory,99,19
11520,Penny,8, No one's saying that. Let's go.,3,Big Bang Theory,32,6
11521,Sheldon,8," Well, it does seem rather ironic that for want of 99-cent adhesive ducks, we both might die in a fiery car crash.",3,Big Bang Theory,114,22
11523,Leonard,8," I wish Penny didn't have to work, she loves camping.",3,Big Bang Theory,53,10
11524,Raj,8," Yeah, that would have been great. You and Penny having sex in the tent while I sit out here and watch Howard hump a cactus.",3,Big Bang Theory,124,25
11525,Howard,8," Okay, the best I can tell, there are eight other campsites nearby. Mostly science nerds like us, but just over yon ridge are two not unattractive middle school teachers who reek of desperation.",3,Big Bang Theory,194,33
11526,Raj,8, Wow. Wonderful. How old are they?,3,Big Bang Theory,34,6
11527,Howard,8," Oh I don't know, 50, 55.",3,Big Bang Theory,25,6
11528,Raj,8," Oh, menopause, nature's birth control.",3,Big Bang Theory,39,5
11529,Leonard,8," Come on, you guys can't be that hard up.",3,Big Bang Theory,41,9
11530,Howard,8, I am.,3,Big Bang Theory,6,2
11531,Raj,8," Yeah, me, too.",3,Big Bang Theory,15,3
11532,Howard,8," Look, they gave me homemade cookies.",3,Big Bang Theory,37,6
11533,Leonard,8," Of course, they did. That's what grandmothers do.",3,Big Bang Theory,50,8
11534,Raj,8," So, what are we waiting for?",3,Big Bang Theory,29,6
11535,Howard,8," Relax, I said we'd stop by a little later after they have their nap.",3,Big Bang Theory,69,14
11536,Raj,8, Good idea. They'll be refreshed.,3,Big Bang Theory,33,5
11537,Howard,8, Cookie?,3,Big Bang Theory,8,1
11538,Raj,8," Yeah, thank you. Mmmm.",3,Big Bang Theory,23,4
11539,Leonard,8," Mmmm, not bad.",3,Big Bang Theory,15,3
11540,Raj,8," Yeah, very tasty. Well, so tell me more about these teachers.",3,Big Bang Theory,62,11
11541,Howard,8, Not much to tell. They had a VW Microbus and were wearing tie-dyed Grateful Dead shirts.,3,Big Bang Theory,89,16
11542,Raj,8, Huh. Mmm. Good cookies.,3,Big Bang Theory,24,4
11544,Sheldon,8, I see no organizational system in here whatsoever. Which panties do you wear on Mondays?,3,Big Bang Theory,89,15
11545,Penny,8," I don't need panties, I just need shorts and a shirt.",3,Big Bang Theory,54,11
11546,Sheldon,8, My mother always told me one should wear clean underpants in case one is in an accident.,3,Big Bang Theory,89,17
11547,Penny,8, One was already in an accident.,3,Big Bang Theory,32,6
11548,Sheldon,8," That doesn't mean one won't be in another, especially if I'm driving.",3,Big Bang Theory,70,12
11549,Penny,8," Clothes, Sheldon. I need clothes!",3,Big Bang Theory,34,5
11550,Sheldon,8," Okay, here.",3,Big Bang Theory,12,2
11551,Penny,8, Seriously? Those shorts with that top?,3,Big Bang Theory,39,6
11552,Sheldon,8, All right.,3,Big Bang Theory,11,2
11553,Penny,8," No No Oh, that's cute.",3,Big Bang Theory,23,5
11554,Sheldon,8, We should have you checked for a concussion.,3,Big Bang Theory,45,8
11555,Penny,8," Okay, now, you got to help me put these on.",3,Big Bang Theory,44,10
11556,Sheldon,8, All right.,3,Big Bang Theory,11,2
11557,Penny,8, But don't look.,3,Big Bang Theory,16,3
11558,Sheldon,8, Don't look?,3,Big Bang Theory,12,2
11559,Penny,8, I don't want you to see me naked.,3,Big Bang Theory,34,8
11560,Sheldon,8," Oh. Well, that's understandable. You may be interested to know that a prohibition against looking is well established in heroic mythology. Uh, Lot and his wife, Perseus and Medusa, Orpheus and Eurydice.",3,Big Bang Theory,203,32
11561,Penny,8," Yeah, great.",3,Big Bang Theory,13,2
11562,Sheldon,8, They always look. It never ends well.,3,Big Bang Theory,38,7
11563,Penny,8," Ok, now you gotta help me get my arm into the sleeve.",3,Big Bang Theory,54,12
11564,Sheldon,8, Ok.,3,Big Bang Theory,4,1
11565,Penny,8, Is that my arm?,3,Big Bang Theory,16,4
11566,Sheldon,8, It doesn't feel like an arm.,3,Big Bang Theory,29,6
11567,Penny,8," Then, maybe you should let it go.",3,Big Bang Theory,34,7
11568,Sheldon,8, All righty.,3,Big Bang Theory,12,2
11570,Leonard,8," Stars are pretty, aren't they?",3,Big Bang Theory,31,5
11571,Howard,8," Up above the world so high, like little diamonds in the sky.",3,Big Bang Theory,61,12
11572,Raj,8," That's beautiful, dude. You should You should write that down before someone steals it.",3,Big Bang Theory,88,14
11573,Howard,8," So, when do the meteors get here?",3,Big Bang Theory,34,7
11574,Raj,8," The meteors don't get here, the earth is moving into their path.",3,Big Bang Theory,65,12
11575,Leonard,8," I can feel it. I can feel the earth moving. It's moving too fast. Raj, slow it down.",3,Big Bang Theory,85,18
11576,Raj,8," Okay, how's that?",3,Big Bang Theory,18,3
11577,Leonard,8, Better. Thanks.,3,Big Bang Theory,16,2
11578,Howard,8," Stars are pretty, aren't they?",3,Big Bang Theory,31,5
11579,Leonard,8, What's so funny?,3,Big Bang Theory,17,3
11580,Raj,8," It's your American accent. Everything you say sounds stupid.  Stars are pretty, aren't they?",3,Big Bang Theory,93,14
11582,Sheldon,8," For the record, I should let you know this is my first time driving an actual motor vehicle.",3,Big Bang Theory,93,18
11583,Penny,8," You have your learner's permit, right?",3,Big Bang Theory,39,6
11584,Sheldon,8," Yes, and I have logged a considerable number of hours on a simulator.",3,Big Bang Theory,70,13
11585,Penny,8, Good.,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
11586,Sheldon,8, Didn't work out well.,3,Big Bang Theory,22,4
11587,Penny,8," All right, can we please go?",3,Big Bang Theory,29,6
11588,Sheldon,8," One moment. According to my driver's ed book, a side mirror is properly adjusted when a portion of the is driver's door handle is visible in the lower right corner. There's the handle. Oh, no, too far, bringing it back. Optimized. Now, where is the switch to adjust the passenger side mirror?",3,Big Bang Theory,293,52
11589,Penny,8, It's right there.,3,Big Bang Theory,18,3
11590,Sheldon,8, Where is the passenger side mirror?,3,Big Bang Theory,36,6
11591,Penny,8," In a parking lot in Hollywood. Now, can we please go?",3,Big Bang Theory,54,11
11592,Sheldon,8," Yes. As soon as I adjust my seat. Whee! Oh, dear. I'm going to have to start again.",3,Big Bang Theory,84,18
11594,Raj,8," If I could speak the language of rabbits, they would be amazed, and I would be their king.",3,Big Bang Theory,91,18
11595,Leonard,8, I hate my name. It has nerd in it. Len nerd.,3,Big Bang Theory,45,11
11596,Howard,8, I lost my virginity to my cousin Jeanie.,3,Big Bang Theory,41,8
11597,Raj,8, I would be kind to my rabbit subjects. At first.,3,Big Bang Theory,49,10
11598,Leonard,8, You know what's a cool name? Angelo. That has angel and jell-o in it.,3,Big Bang Theory,70,14
11599,Howard,8, It was my Uncle Murray's funeral. We were all back at my Aunt Barbara's house. Our eyes locked over the pickled herring. We never meant for it to happen.,3,Big Bang Theory,154,29
11600,Raj,8," One day, I hold a great ball for the President of France, but the rabbits, they hate me and don't come. I am embarrassed, so I eat all the lettuce in the world and make them watch.",3,Big Bang Theory,181,37
11601,Leonard,8," People could call me Angie. Yo, Angie, how's it goin'?",3,Big Bang Theory,55,10
11602,Howard,8," To this day, I can't look at pickled herring without being aroused and ashamed. Oh, cousin Jeanie.",3,Big Bang Theory,99,17
11604,Penny,8, Could you please drive a little faster?,3,Big Bang Theory,40,7
11605,Sheldon,8," Oh, I think we're going sufficiently fast. What's that?",3,Big Bang Theory,56,9
11606,Penny,8, Nothing. The engine does that sometimes.,3,Big Bang Theory,41,6
11607,Sheldon,8," That can't be nothing, the check engine light is on. We need to find a service station.",3,Big Bang Theory,88,17
11608,Penny,8, No. The light has been on since I bought the car.,3,Big Bang Theory,50,11
11609,Sheldon,8, All the more reason to consult with a mechanic before it explodes.,3,Big Bang Theory,67,12
11610,Penny,8," It's not going to explode, just keep driving. Warp speed ahead, Mr. Spock.",3,Big Bang Theory,75,13
11611,Sheldon,8," Mr. Spock did not pilot the Enterprise. He was the science officer, and I guarantee you that if he ever saw the Enterprise's check engine light blinking, he would pull the ship over immediately.",3,Big Bang Theory,195,34
11612,Penny,8," Oh, god, I'm gonna lose the arm.",3,Big Bang Theory,33,7
11613,Sheldon,8," Oh, oh, red light, release accelerator and slowly apply the brake. Nailed it. While we have a moment, may I ask you a question?",3,Big Bang Theory,128,24
11614,Penny,8, What?,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
11615,Sheldon,8, Why do you have the Chinese character for soup tattooed on your right buttock?,3,Big Bang Theory,79,14
11616,Penny,8," It's not soup, it's courage.",3,Big Bang Theory,29,5
11617,Sheldon,8," No, it isn't. But I suppose it does take courage to demonstrate that kind of commitment to soup.",3,Big Bang Theory,97,18
11618,Penny,8, How did you see it? You said you wouldn't look.,3,Big Bang Theory,48,10
11619,Sheldon,8," Sorry. As I told you, the hero always peeks.",3,Big Bang Theory,45,9
11621,Howard,8, Anything?,3,Big Bang Theory,10,1
11622,Leonard,8, No. That was the last pudding cup.,3,Big Bang Theory,35,7
11623,Howard,8, No! What about Slim Jims?,3,Big Bang Theory,26,5
11624,Leonard,8," That's what he used to eat his pudding, remember?",3,Big Bang Theory,50,9
11625,Raj,8, Right! That was so good! Sweety and meaty at the same time.,3,Big Bang Theory,60,12
11626,Howard,8," Wait. Wait, wait. So you're saying we're out of food?",3,Big Bang Theory,54,10
11627,Leonard,8, The only thing in here are blue ice packs.,3,Big Bang Theory,43,9
11628,Raj,8," I know they're poison, but they look like big, yummy otter pops.",3,Big Bang Theory,65,12
11629,Leonard,8," Oh, god, I am so hungry.",3,Big Bang Theory,25,6
11630,Howard,8, Me too. Check and see if we have any more pudding.,3,Big Bang Theory,51,11
11631,Leonard,8, Okay.,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
11633,Sheldon,8," All right, there's no need to bark at me. According to the inexplicably irritable nurse behind the desk, you'll be seen after the man who claims to be having a heart attack, but appears to be well enough to play Doodle Jump on his iPhone. We have to fill these out. Describe illness or injury.",3,Big Bang Theory,294,55
11634,Penny,8, I dislocated my shoulder.,3,Big Bang Theory,26,4
11635,Sheldon,8, All right. And how did the accident occur?,3,Big Bang Theory,43,8
11636,Penny,8, You ready know that.,3,Big Bang Theory,21,4
11637,Sheldon,8," Cause of accident, lack of adhesive ducks. Okay, medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes?",3,Big Bang Theory,110,17
11638,Penny,8, No.,3,Big Bang Theory,4,1
11639,Sheldon,8, Kidney disease?,3,Big Bang Theory,16,2
11640,Penny,8, No.,3,Big Bang Theory,4,1
11641,Sheldon,8, Migraines?,3,Big Bang Theory,11,1
11642,Penny,8, Getting one.,3,Big Bang Theory,13,2
11643,Sheldon,8, Are you currently pregnant?,3,Big Bang Theory,28,4
11644,Penny,8, No.,3,Big Bang Theory,4,1
11645,Sheldon,8, Are you sure? You look a bit puffy.,3,Big Bang Theory,36,8
11646,Penny,8, Change migraine to yes.,3,Big Bang Theory,24,4
11647,Sheldon,8, When was your last menstrual period?,3,Big Bang Theory,37,6
11648,Penny,8," Oh, next question.",3,Big Bang Theory,19,3
11649,Sheldon,8," I'll put, in progress. Okay, moving to psychiatric disorders, list all major behavioural diagnoses, e.g. depression, anxiety, etcetera.",3,Big Bang Theory,136,18
11650,Penny,8," Oh, my god, what the hell does this have to do with my stupid shoulder?",3,Big Bang Theory,72,15
11651,Sheldon,8, Episodes of sub psychotic rage.,3,Big Bang Theory,32,5
11652,Penny,8, Ass.,3,Big Bang Theory,5,1
11653,Sheldon,8," Possible Tourette's. All right, moles, lesions or other skin conditions. Soup tattoo on right buttock.",3,Big Bang Theory,103,15
11654,Penny,8," Hey, Sheldon, Sheldon, look, I am scared and in a lot of pain. Could you please just take a break from being you for just a minute and try being, I don't know, comforting?",3,Big Bang Theory,172,34
11655,Sheldon,8," I'm sorry. There, there. Everything's going to be fine. Sheldon's here.",3,Big Bang Theory,72,11
11656,Penny,8, Thanks. That's much better.,3,Big Bang Theory,28,4
11658,Raj,8," Oh, I'm so hungry!",3,Big Bang Theory,19,4
11659,Leonard,8, Will you shut up? We're all hungry.,3,Big Bang Theory,36,7
11660,Howard,8," Okay, our objective is the boy scout campsite to the east. Easy target. Big doughy scout master, couple of cubs, most webelos.",3,Big Bang Theory,127,22
11661,Leonard,8, What kind of score are we looking at?,3,Big Bang Theory,38,8
11662,Howard,8," Hot dogs, buns, s'mores, I mean, it's a freaking 7-11.",3,Big Bang Theory,55,10
11663,Leonard,8," All right, everyone grab flashlights.",3,Big Bang Theory,38,5
11664,Howard,8," Oh, my god, could it be? Yes! My mother put an I love you brisket in my backpack.",3,Big Bang Theory,82,18
11665,Leonard,8," Quick, get forks.",3,Big Bang Theory,18,3
11666,Howard,8," You don't need forks. It's so tender, it falls apart in your hands.",3,Big Bang Theory,68,13
11667,Raj,8, He's right.,3,Big Bang Theory,12,2
11668,Leonard,8, I feel like we're forgetting something important.,3,Big Bang Theory,50,7
11669,Raj,8," Me, too. But what? ",3,Big Bang Theory,20,4
11670,Howard,8, Maybe a tupperware bowl of roasted potatoes and carrots?,3,Big Bang Theory,57,9
11673,Sheldon,8," Now remember, you were given powerful pain medication and a muscle relaxer, so, uh, don't operate heavy machinery. Try not to choke on your own drool.",3,Big Bang Theory,151,26
11674,Penny,8, Wait. You have to help me get into bed. Sheldon has to get me into bed. Bet you never thought I'd say that.,3,Big Bang Theory,108,23
11675,Sheldon,8, Yes. The charm of your drug addled candour knows no bounds.,3,Big Bang Theory,60,11
11676,Penny,8," You know, people think you're this weird robot man who's so annoying all the time, and you totally are, but then it's like that movie Wall-E at the end. You're so full of love, and you can save a plant and get fat people out of the floaty chairs.",3,Big Bang Theory,247,49
11677,Sheldon,8," That's a fairly laboured metaphor, but I appreciate the sentiment behind it.",3,Big Bang Theory,77,12
11678,Penny,8, Sing â€œSoft Kittyâ€ù to me.,3,Big Bang Theory,29,5
11679,Sheldon,8, â€œSoft Kittyâ€ù is for when you're sick. You're not sick.,3,Big Bang Theory,59,10
11680,Penny,8, Injured and drugged is a kind of sick.,3,Big Bang Theory,39,8
11681,Sheldon,8," Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur",3,Big Bang Theory,43,8
11682,Penny,8," Wait, wait. Let's sing it as a round. I'll start. Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur See that's where you come in. I'll start over. Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur I've got all night, Sheldon. Soft kitty, warm kitty  little ball of fur, happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr.",3,Big Bang Theory,301,55
11684,Raj,8," And the next morning when he woke up, he rolled over and realized duh-duh-duh! she was his cousin.",3,Big Bang Theory,99,18
11685,Howard,8, That's still not funny.,3,Big Bang Theory,24,4
11686,Raj,8, That's still not funny.,3,Big Bang Theory,24,4
11687,Howard,8, And she was my second cousin.,3,Big Bang Theory,30,6
11688,Raj,8, And she was my second cousin.,3,Big Bang Theory,30,6
11689,Howard,8, You're a real douche.,3,Big Bang Theory,22,4
11690,Raj,8, Who cares? You slept with your cousin.,3,Big Bang Theory,39,7
11692,Howard,9," So two years later, there's a knock on the door, guy opens it, and there on his porch is the snail, who says, â€œWhat the heck was all that about?â€ù",3,Big Bang Theory,150,30
11694,Howard,9," Well, see, it took two years for the snail to  not important.",3,Big Bang Theory,62,12
11696,Howard,9, Sure.,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
11698,Howard,9," To be honest, I was hoping at least second base.",3,Big Bang Theory,49,10
11700,Howard,9," A Jewish stand-up comedian, that'd be new.",3,Big Bang Theory,43,7
11702,Howard,9," No, I was just never mind.",3,Big Bang Theory,27,6
11704,Howard,9, We do?,3,Big Bang Theory,7,2
11706,Howard,9, You're kidding.,3,Big Bang Theory,16,2
11708,Howard,9," Okay, just to be clear, there's only one correct answer, right? It's not like chicken or fish on an airplane?",3,Big Bang Theory,110,20
11710,Howard,9," You know, it's not unheard of for a one-night stand to turn into a relationship.",3,Big Bang Theory,81,15
11712,Howard,9, Three dates means sex? Who knew?,3,Big Bang Theory,33,6
11714,Howard,9," Greetings, homies, homette.",3,Big Bang Theory,28,3
11715,Penny,9, Why are you back from your date so early?,3,Big Bang Theory,42,9
11716,Howard,9," In romance, as in show business, always leave them wanting more.",3,Big Bang Theory,65,11
11717,Penny,9, What exactly does that mean?,3,Big Bang Theory,29,5
11718,Leonard,9, He struck out.,3,Big Bang Theory,15,3
11720,Howard,9," Hey, did either of you guys know that three dates with the same woman is the threshold for sex?",3,Big Bang Theory,96,19
11721,Raj,9," Actually, I've never had three dates with the same woman.",3,Big Bang Theory,58,10
11722,Leonard,9," With Penny and me, it took two years. Now that I think about it, that was three dates.",3,Big Bang Theory,87,18
11723,Howard,9," Okay, well, before you and Penny hooked up, did she ask for any kind of commitment?",3,Big Bang Theory,84,16
11724,Leonard,9," No, she was pretty clear about wanting to keep her options open.",3,Big Bang Theory,65,12
11725,Sheldon,9," I have something to announce, but out of respect for convention, I will wait for you to finish your current conversation. What are you talking about?",3,Big Bang Theory,150,26
11726,Leonard,9, The cultural paradigm in which people have sex after three dates.,3,Big Bang Theory,66,11
11727,Sheldon,9," I see. Now, are we talking date, the social interaction, or date, the dried fruit?",3,Big Bang Theory,83,15
11728,Leonard,9," Never mind, what's your announcement?",3,Big Bang Theory,38,5
11729,Sheldon,9," Oh, good, my turn. Well, this is very exciting and I wanted you to be among the first to know",3,Big Bang Theory,94,20
11731,Sheldon,9," Thank you, Kripke, for depriving me of the opportunity to share my news with my friends.",3,Big Bang Theory,89,16
11733,Sheldon,9, My thank you was not sincere.,3,Big Bang Theory,30,6
11735,Sheldon,9, Why are you such a stupid head? That is also rhetorical. I'm sorry you had to hear that.,3,Big Bang Theory,89,18
11736,Leonard,9, Are you really going to be on NPR?,3,Big Bang Theory,35,8
11737,Sheldon,9," Yes, they're interviewing me by phone from my office, regarding the recent so-called discovery of magnetic monopoles in spin-ices. It's pledge week and they're trying to goose the ratings with a little controversy.",3,Big Bang Theory,215,33
11738,Leonard,9," Very cool, congratulations.",3,Big Bang Theory,28,3
11739,Sheldon,9," Thank you. My mother is very excited. She's convening her Bible study group to listen in, and then pray for my soul.",3,Big Bang Theory,117,22
11741,Sheldon,9," All right. These are the talking points for my NPR interview tomorrow. I need to make sure that they're simple enough for the less educated in the audience to understand. Howard, look this over and tell me what's unclear to you.",3,Big Bang Theory,229,41
11742,Howard,9," Excuse me, I have a master's degree in engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It required the completion of 144 units of grad work and an original thesis.",3,Big Bang Theory,176,29
11743,Sheldon,9, Yes. Look this over and tell me what's unclear to you.,3,Big Bang Theory,55,11
11744,Leonard,9," You know, when Sheldon gives you homework, you don't have to do it.",3,Big Bang Theory,68,13
11745,Raj,9," In fact, it's better if you don't, otherwise it makes the rest of us look bad.",3,Big Bang Theory,79,16
11746,Penny,9," Hi, guys.",3,Big Bang Theory,10,2
11747,Leonard,9, Hey.,3,Big Bang Theory,5,1
11748,Sheldon,9, Hello.,3,Big Bang Theory,7,1
11749,Penny,9," Yo, Raj, talk to me. I'm sorry, just screwing with you. Hey, Howard, why haven't you called Bernadette?",3,Big Bang Theory,104,18
11750,Howard,9, Did she say something?,3,Big Bang Theory,23,4
11751,Penny,9," Yeah, she said she hasn't heard from you in a week. I thought you liked her?",3,Big Bang Theory,77,16
11752,Howard,9," I do, yeah, but she wants a commitment and I'm not sure she's my type.",3,Big Bang Theory,71,15
11753,Penny,9, She agreed to go out with you for free. What more do you need?,3,Big Bang Theory,63,14
11754,Howard,9," Look, Bernadette is really nice. I just always thought when I finally settle down into a relationship, it would be with someone, you know, different.",3,Big Bang Theory,150,25
11755,Penny,9, Different how?,3,Big Bang Theory,15,2
11756,Howard,9," Well, you know, more like Megan Fox from Transformers, or Katee Sackhoff from Battlestar Galactica.",3,Big Bang Theory,100,15
11757,Penny,9, Are you high?,3,Big Bang Theory,14,3
11758,Leonard,9, You'd have a better shot with the three-breasted Martian hooker from Total Recall.,3,Big Bang Theory,83,13
11759,Howard,9," Okay, now you're just being unrealistic. Anyway, that movie was like 20 years ago, imagine how saggy those things would be.",3,Big Bang Theory,124,21
11760,Penny,9," Howard, you're going to throw away a great girl like Bernadette because you're holding out for some ridiculous fantasy?",3,Big Bang Theory,120,19
11761,Howard,9," Hey, just because you settled doesn't mean I have to.",3,Big Bang Theory,54,10
11762,Leonard,9," Excuse me, I'm sitting here.",3,Big Bang Theory,29,5
11763,Penny,9," Hey, I did not settle for Leonard. I mean, obviously, he isn't the kind of guy I usually go out with, you know, physically.",3,Big Bang Theory,124,24
11764,Leonard,9," Again, I'm right here.",3,Big Bang Theory,23,4
11765,Penny,9," My point is, I do not judge a book by its cover. I am interested in the person underneath.",3,Big Bang Theory,91,19
11766,Leonard,9," I am here, right? You see me.",3,Big Bang Theory,30,7
11767,Howard,9," Hey, I'm interested in what's inside people, too, but why is it wrong to want those insides wrapped up in, say, the delicious caramel that is Halle Berry?  Yes, you're delicious caramel, too.",3,Big Bang Theory,192,33
11768,Penny,9," All right, you know what, I will tell you why it's wrong",3,Big Bang Theory,57,12
11769,Sheldon,9," Excuse me, may I interject?",3,Big Bang Theory,28,5
11770,Penny,9, What?,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
11771,Sheldon,9," Biologically speaking, Howard is perfectly justified in seeking out the optimum mate for the propagation of his genetic line.",3,Big Bang Theory,126,19
11772,Howard,9," Thank you, Sheldon.",3,Big Bang Theory,20,3
11773,Sheldon,9," Now, whether that propagation is in the interest of humanity is, of course, an entirely different question.",3,Big Bang Theory,108,17
11778,Sheldon,9," My pleasure, Ira.",3,Big Bang Theory,18,3
11780,Sheldon,9," Of course. First, consider an ordinary magnet which has,  as even the most uneducated in your audience must know, two poles,  a north and south pole. If you cut that in half, you have two smaller magnets, each with its own north and south pole.",3,Big Bang Theory,245,45
11782,Sheldon,9," No, I hear you fine. As I was saying, an ordinary magnet has two poles. The primary characteristic of a monopole is that it has only one pole, hence, monopole.",3,Big Bang Theory,160,30
11783,Sheldon,9," A requirement for string theory, or M-theory, if you will, is the existence of such monopoles. I, myself, led an expedition to the Arctic Circle in search of said particles. Kripke, I found the nozzle! I'm going to kill you!",3,Big Bang Theory,225,40
11785,Howard,9, So nice you could join me this evening. You're looking lovely as always.,3,Big Bang Theory,73,13
11787,Howard,9," Come on, Katee, don't make it sound so cheap.",3,Big Bang Theory,46,9
11789,Howard,9," Thank you. So, shall we get started?",3,Big Bang Theory,37,7
11791,Howard,9, You want to play Cylon and colonist?,3,Big Bang Theory,37,7
11793,Howard,9," You mean, Bernadette?",3,Big Bang Theory,22,3
11795,Howard,9," I know, but she's not you.",3,Big Bang Theory,27,6
11797,Howard,9, Really? Tall?,3,Big Bang Theory,14,2
11799,Howard,9, Ouch.,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
11802,Howard,9, I'm taking a bath!,3,Big Bang Theory,19,4
11804,Howard,9," Don't remind me!  Oh, man. All soaped up and no place to go.",3,Big Bang Theory,61,13
11806,Leonard,9," How ya doin', buddy?",3,Big Bang Theory,21,4
11807,Sheldon,9, I was humiliated on national radio. How do you think I'm doing?,3,Big Bang Theory,64,12
11808,Leonard,9," Come on, it wasn't that bad.",3,Big Bang Theory,29,6
11809,Sheldon,9, What do you want?,3,Big Bang Theory,18,4
11810,Raj,9," We represent the Lollipop Guild, and we want you.",3,Big Bang Theory,50,9
11811,Leonard,9," Okay, so Kripke played a joke on you.",3,Big Bang Theory,38,8
11812,Sheldon,9, It wasn't funny.,3,Big Bang Theory,17,3
11813,Raj,9, I thought it was funny.,3,Big Bang Theory,24,5
11814,Leonard,9, Raj.,3,Big Bang Theory,5,1
11815,Raj,9, You laughed.,3,Big Bang Theory,13,2
11816,Sheldon,9, Did you laugh?,3,Big Bang Theory,15,3
11817,Leonard,9," I fell on the floor. All right, he got you, you can get him back.",3,Big Bang Theory,66,15
11818,Sheldon,9, I refuse to sink to his level.,3,Big Bang Theory,31,7
11819,Raj,9," You can't sink. With all that helium in you, you're lucky you don't float away.",3,Big Bang Theory,80,15
11820,Leonard,9, Are you really admitting defeat?,3,Big Bang Theory,33,5
11821,Sheldon,9, I never admit defeat.,3,Big Bang Theory,22,4
11822,Leonard,9, Good.,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
11823,Sheldon,9," However, on an unrelated topic, I am never getting out of this bed again.",3,Big Bang Theory,74,14
11824,Leonard,9, What if you could make Kripke look even sillier than he made you look?,3,Big Bang Theory,71,14
11825,Raj,9," I don't think that's possible, dude.",3,Big Bang Theory,37,6
11826,Leonard,9, You're not helping.,3,Big Bang Theory,20,3
11827,Raj,9," I didn't come to help, I came to mock.",3,Big Bang Theory,39,9
11828,Leonard,9," Sheldon, what you need to do is figure out a way to exact vengeance on Kripke, like, uh, like, how the Joker got back at Batman for putting him in the Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane.",3,Big Bang Theory,192,37
11829,Raj,9," That's true. He didn't just stay there and talk about his feelings with the other psychotic villains. He, he broke out and poisoned Gotham's water supply.",3,Big Bang Theory,155,26
11830,Sheldon,9," Well, I suppose I could poison Kripke.",3,Big Bang Theory,39,7
11831,Leonard,9," No, no.",3,Big Bang Theory,8,2
11832,Sheldon,9, It's a simple matter. There are several toxic chemicals that'd be untraceable in an autopsy.,3,Big Bang Theory,93,15
11833,Leonard,9," Okay, uh, that's the spirit, but, um, let's dial it back to a non-lethal form of vengeance.",3,Big Bang Theory,92,17
11834,Sheldon,9," Oh! How about we put awhoopee cushion on his office chair? He'll sit down, it'll sound like he's flatulent, even though he's not.",3,Big Bang Theory,130,23
11835,Leonard,9, Let's keep thinking.,3,Big Bang Theory,21,3
11837,Penny,9," Oh, gee, you're too late. Scarlett Johansson and Wonder Woman were just in here trolling around for neurotic, little weasels.",3,Big Bang Theory,126,20
11838,Howard,9," Yeah, I came to talk to Bernadette. She's working today, right?",3,Big Bang Theory,64,11
11839,Penny,9," Yes, but I don't think she wants to see you.",3,Big Bang Theory,45,10
11840,Howard,9, Why not?,3,Big Bang Theory,9,2
11841,Penny,9," Come on, Howard. You hurt her feelings by not calling her all week. Plus, I've kind of been talkin' some smack about ya.",3,Big Bang Theory,121,23
11843,Howard,9," Wait, Bernadette, I need to talk to you.",3,Big Bang Theory,41,8
11845,Howard,9," This will only take a second. You asked me to think about where our relationship was going, and I did. Bernadette? Will you marry me?",3,Big Bang Theory,134,25
11847,Howard,9," No. I'm serious. I'm never going to find another girl like you who likes me and is, you know, real.",3,Big Bang Theory,100,20
11849,Howard,9, No.,3,Big Bang Theory,4,1
11851,Howard,9, I prefer to think of myself as quirky.,3,Big Bang Theory,39,8
11853,Howard,9, Fair enough. When's your break?,3,Big Bang Theory,32,5
11855,Howard,9, Don't you just hate when this happens?,3,Big Bang Theory,39,7
11856,Penny,9, Wow.,3,Big Bang Theory,5,1
11858,Sheldon,9," All right, how's this for revenge? A solution of hydrogen peroxide, and one of saturated potassium iodide.",3,Big Bang Theory,107,17
11859,Raj,9, What's this?,3,Big Bang Theory,13,2
11860,Sheldon,9," Mountain Dew. Ah, refreshing. Now, we're going to combine these chemicals with ordinary dish soap, creating a little exothermic release of oxygen.",3,Big Bang Theory,147,22
11861,Raj,9, Foamy vengeance.,3,Big Bang Theory,17,2
11862,Sheldon,9," Yes, exactly.",3,Big Bang Theory,14,2
11863,Leonard,9," This is brilliant, Sheldon. How are we going to deploy it in Kripke's office?",3,Big Bang Theory,78,14
11864,Sheldon,9," Already taken care of. Observe. This is a live shot of Kripke's lab via a mini webcam I was able to install, thanks to a dollar bill discreetly placed in the night janitor's shirt pocket. At the same time, I also secured large quantities of these chemicals above the tiles in the drop ceiling.",3,Big Bang Theory,294,54
11865,Raj,9," Oh, Sheldon, you remind me of a young Lex Luthor.",3,Big Bang Theory,50,10
11866,Sheldon,9," You flatter me, sir.",3,Big Bang Theory,21,4
11867,Leonard,9," Let me guess, motion sensors?",3,Big Bang Theory,30,5
11868,Sheldon,9," The reaction will be triggered when Kripke reaches the center of the room. Mwah, ha, ha.",3,Big Bang Theory,89,16
11869,Leonard,9," I gotta say, I am really impressed. This is truly the Sheldon Cooper way to get even. ",3,Big Bang Theory,87,17
11870,Sheldon,9," It may be low-tech, but I still maintain the whoopee cushion has comic validity.",3,Big Bang Theory,81,14
11871,Raj,9, Here comes Kripke!,3,Big Bang Theory,19,3
11872,Leonard,9, Who is that with him?,3,Big Bang Theory,22,5
11873,Raj,9, I believe that's the president of the university.,3,Big Bang Theory,50,8
11874,Leonard,9, And the board of directors. Abort! Abort!,3,Big Bang Theory,42,7
11875,Sheldon,9, There is no abort.,3,Big Bang Theory,19,4
11876,Raj,9," Well, how could you not put in an abort?",3,Big Bang Theory,41,9
11877,Sheldon,9," I made a boo-boo, all right?",3,Big Bang Theory,29,6
11879,Raj,9, Wow. Looks like the Ganges on laundry day.,3,Big Bang Theory,43,8
11880,Leonard,9, At least they don't know it was you.,3,Big Bang Theory,37,8
11881,Sheldon,9," Hello, Kripke. This classic prank comes to you from the malevolent mind of Sheldon Cooper. If you'd like to see the look on your stupid face, this video is being instantly uploaded to YouTube. Oh, and a hat tip to Leonard Hofstadter and Raj Koothrappali for their support and encouragement in this enterprise.",3,Big Bang Theory,310,53
11882,Raj,9," Well, I'm going back to India. What's your plan?",3,Big Bang Theory,49,9
11884,Penny,9," Hey, here's your tip from table seven.",3,Big Bang Theory,39,7
11886,Penny,9, Mm-hmm.,3,Big Bang Theory,8,1
11887,Howard,9, Testing. Check. Check two.,3,Big Bang Theory,27,4
11889,Penny,9, You want me to throw him out?,3,Big Bang Theory,30,7
11891,Penny,9," Are you sure? He's small. I bet I can get a nice, tight spiral on him.",3,Big Bang Theory,71,16
11892,Howard,9," I want to dedicate this number to a great gal who I've done wrong.   Bernadette, I am so sorry for trying to propose to you, Bernadette, you found it creepy but that's just the kind of thing I do. I know now it was too soon to talk of love. It was just a crazy idea that came to me in my tub. But, Bernadette, give me one more chance, sweet Bernadette, I'll get the hang of this thing they call romance, sweet Bernadette, I dream to once again kiss your lips, sweet Bernadette. Sincerely yours, Howard Wolowitz, Bernadette",3,Big Bang Theory,523,99
11893,Penny,9," Oh, I am so sorry.",3,Big Bang Theory,19,5
11895,Howard,9," Bernadette! Thank you, Cheesecake Factory!",3,Big Bang Theory,43,5
11897,Penny,10," Hey, Leonard, check this out. ",3,Big Bang Theory,31,5
11898,Sheldon,10," Leonard, she's doing it again.",3,Big Bang Theory,31,5
11899,Leonard,10, I think it upsets Sheldon when you play with the food.,3,Big Bang Theory,55,11
11900,Sheldon,10, No. It upsets Sheldon when she willy-nilly takes it from the containers without regard for its equitable distribution. This is essentially why you have famine in India.,3,Big Bang Theory,169,27
11901,Penny,10, You want me to put it back?,3,Big Bang Theory,28,7
11902,Sheldon,10, Leonard.,3,Big Bang Theory,9,1
11903,Leonard,10, It upsets Sheldon when you play with the Sheldon.,3,Big Bang Theory,50,9
11904,Howard,10," What's up, my nerdizzles? Raj, Sheldon, I want you to meet my girlfriend Bernadette.",3,Big Bang Theory,85,14
11905,Sheldon,10, Hello.,3,Big Bang Theory,7,1
11906,Howard,10," Leonard, Penny, you know my girlfriend Bernadette.",3,Big Bang Theory,51,7
11907,Leonard,10, Yeah. Hey.,3,Big Bang Theory,11,2
11908,Howard,10," Bernadette, say fo'shizzle to my nerdizzles.",3,Big Bang Theory,45,6
11910,Howard,10," I hope it's all right, I told my girlfriend Bernadette she could join us for dinner.",3,Big Bang Theory,85,16
11911,Leonard,10," Sure. The more, the merrier.",3,Big Bang Theory,29,5
11912,Sheldon,10," Wait, no, that's a false equivalency. More does not equal merry. If there were 2,000 people in this apartment right now, would we be celebrating? No, we'd be suffocating.",3,Big Bang Theory,171,29
11913,Leonard,10, Sheldon,3,Big Bang Theory,8,1
11914,Sheldon,10," Don't Sheldon me. We ordered for five people, not six.",3,Big Bang Theory,55,10
11915,Penny,10," Oh, come on, it's fine. We'll just put it all on the table, you know, family style.",3,Big Bang Theory,84,17
11916,Sheldon,10," Oh, sure. And while we're at it, why don't we put our hands behind our backs, have an old-fashioned eating contest?",3,Big Bang Theory,116,21
11917,Leonard,10," Relax, it'll be fine, sit down, you guys.",3,Big Bang Theory,42,8
11920,Penny,10," Oh, yeah, you can't sit there.",3,Big Bang Theory,31,6
11922,Leonard,10, That's where Sheldon sits.,3,Big Bang Theory,27,4
11924,Penny,10," Oh no, no, you see, in the winter, that seat is close enough to the radiator so that he's warm, yet not so close that he sweats. In the summer, it's directly in the path of a cross-breeze created by opening windows there and there. It faces the television at an angle that isn't direct, so he can still talk to everybody, yet not so wide that the picture looks distorted.",3,Big Bang Theory,372,71
11925,Sheldon,10, Perhaps there's hope for you after all.,3,Big Bang Theory,40,7
11928,Penny,10," Oh, thanks. They are cute, aren't they?",3,Big Bang Theory,40,7
11930,Penny,10, Shoes for Less.,3,Big Bang Theory,16,3
11932,Penny,10," Oh, great selection, great prices.",3,Big Bang Theory,35,5
11933,Sheldon,10, My mother was right. Hell is real.,3,Big Bang Theory,35,7
11934,Howard,10," Come on, Sheldon. let the womenfolk chat.",3,Big Bang Theory,42,7
11935,Penny,10, Womenfolk?,3,Big Bang Theory,11,1
11936,Howard,10, Gals? Chicks? Utero-Americans?,3,Big Bang Theory,31,3
11937,Penny,10, Just eat your dinner.,3,Big Bang Theory,22,4
11939,Penny,10," Yeah, well, I don't think it's very funny.",3,Big Bang Theory,43,8
11941,Penny,10," Howard, never let her go.",3,Big Bang Theory,26,5
11943,Leonard,10, I am. Are you interested in physics?,3,Big Bang Theory,37,7
11945,Leonard,10," Actually, my tests of the Aharonov-Bohm quantum interference effect have reached an interesting point. Right now, we're testing the phase shift due to an electric potential.",3,Big Bang Theory,174,26
11947,Sheldon,10," Yes. Leonard's work is nearly as amazing as third graders growing lima beans in wet paper towels.  While I appreciate the oh, snap, I'm uncomfortable having your moist breath in my ear.",3,Big Bang Theory,186,32
11949,Leonard,10," Yes, I am. You want to see a simulation on my laptop?",3,Big Bang Theory,54,12
11951,Sheldon,10, Howard?,3,Big Bang Theory,8,1
11952,Howard,10, Yeah?,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
11953,Sheldon,10, Your shoes are delightful. Where did you get them?,3,Big Bang Theory,51,9
11954,Howard,10, What?,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
11955,Sheldon,10, Bazinga. I don't care.,3,Big Bang Theory,23,4
11957,Raj,10," Ha! Eat my dust, racially stereotypical plumber.",3,Big Bang Theory,49,7
11958,Sheldon,10, That's not fair. I got stuck behind a tree.,3,Big Bang Theory,44,9
11959,Raj,10," And a cow and a penguin. Face it dude, whether it's a real car or a virtual cartoon car, you can't drive.",3,Big Bang Theory,106,22
11960,Sheldon,10, Just need a little more practice.,3,Big Bang Theory,34,6
11961,Raj,10," What you need is cheat codes, motor skills and a magic genie who grants wishes to little boys who suck at Mario Kart.",3,Big Bang Theory,118,23
11962,Penny,10," Hey, Sheldon, can I talk to you for a second?",3,Big Bang Theory,46,10
11963,Sheldon,10," It's not about shoes, is it? I don't think I could go through that again.",3,Big Bang Theory,74,15
11964,Penny,10, It's not about shoes.,3,Big Bang Theory,22,4
11965,Sheldon,10, Then speak.,3,Big Bang Theory,12,2
11966,Penny,10," Um, actually, can we do it in private?",3,Big Bang Theory,39,8
11967,Sheldon,10," All right.  Go away. I agree, it's rude, but she asked for privacy.",3,Big Bang Theory,68,13
11968,Penny,10," Thanks, Raj. Okay, so here's the thing, I was wondering if you could maybe teach me a little physics?",3,Big Bang Theory,102,19
11969,Sheldon,10," A little physics? There's no such thing. Physics encompasses the entire universe, from quantum particles to supernovas, from spinning electrons to spinning galaxies.",3,Big Bang Theory,166,23
11970,Penny,10," Yeah, okay, cool. I don't need the PBS special, I just want to know enough so I can talk to Leonard about his job. You know, like Bernadette does.",3,Big Bang Theory,147,29
11971,Sheldon,10, Why can't Leonard teach you?,3,Big Bang Theory,29,5
11972,Penny,10, â€˜Cause I want to surprise him.,3,Big Bang Theory,33,6
11973,Sheldon,10," Can't you surprise him in some other way? For example, I'm sure he'd be delightfully taken aback if you cleaned your apartment.",3,Big Bang Theory,128,22
11974,Penny,10," Come on, Sheldon, this is important to me.",3,Big Bang Theory,43,8
11975,Sheldon,10," Penny, this would be a massive undertaking, and my time is both limited and valuable.",3,Big Bang Theory,86,15
11976,Penny,10, You're sitting here playing video games all day.,3,Big Bang Theory,49,8
11977,Sheldon,10," Okay, point. What sort of foundation do you have? Did you take any science classes in school?",3,Big Bang Theory,94,17
11978,Penny,10, Sure. I did the one with the frogs.,3,Big Bang Theory,36,8
11979,Sheldon,10, The one with the frogs.,3,Big Bang Theory,24,5
11980,Penny,10," Yeah, actually, it was pretty cool. A lot of the girls threw up, but I gutted that thing like a deer.",3,Big Bang Theory,102,21
11981,Sheldon,10," I'm sorry, Penny, I don't think so.",3,Big Bang Theory,36,7
11982,Penny,10," Oh, come on! A smart guy like you, it'll be a challenge. You can make it like an experiment.",3,Big Bang Theory,93,19
11983,Sheldon,10," Interesting. I suppose if someone could teach sign language to KoKo the gorilla, I could teach you some rudimentary physics.",3,Big Bang Theory,125,20
11984,Penny,10," Great! It's a little insulting, but great. I'll be KoKo.",3,Big Bang Theory,57,10
11985,Sheldon,10," Not likely. KoKo learned to understand over 2,000 words, not one of which had anything to do with shoes.",3,Big Bang Theory,105,19
11987,Howard,10," Hey, fellas. This is my girlfriend Bernadette. My girlfriend Bernadette.",3,Big Bang Theory,73,10
11989,Howard,10," Have no idea. Hey, Leonard.",3,Big Bang Theory,28,5
11991,Leonard,10," Hey, look, it's Howard and his girlfriend Bernadette.",3,Big Bang Theory,54,8
11992,Howard,10, Thought I'd give the little woman a tour of the old salt mines.,3,Big Bang Theory,64,13
11994,Leonard,10," Yeah, no, I got it.",3,Big Bang Theory,20,5
11996,Leonard,10," Ah, terrific. We're getting the electron accelerator set up. We should be ready to go day after tomorrow.",3,Big Bang Theory,106,18
11998,Leonard,10, You're welcome to come.,3,Big Bang Theory,24,4
12000,Howard,10, Like Hanukkah in July.,3,Big Bang Theory,23,4
12002,Howard,10, No.,3,Big Bang Theory,4,1
12004,Howard,10," Could you grab me another napkin, sweetie?",3,Big Bang Theory,43,7
12006,Howard,10," Thanks, honey.  All right, what is your deal?",3,Big Bang Theory,46,8
12007,Leonard,10, Excuse me?,3,Big Bang Theory,11,2
12008,Howard,10, Inviting my girlfriend to come see your electron accelerator?,3,Big Bang Theory,62,9
12009,Leonard,10, Yeah? So?,3,Big Bang Theory,10,2
12010,Howard,10," Wow! You really are a piece of work. It's not enough you get the prom queen, you have to get the head of the decorating committee, too?",3,Big Bang Theory,136,27
12011,Leonard,10, What are you talking about?,3,Big Bang Theory,28,5
12012,Howard,10, Don't play innocent with me. I practically invented using fancy lab equipment to seduce women.,3,Big Bang Theory,95,15
12013,Leonard,10, Has it ever worked?,3,Big Bang Theory,20,4
12014,Howard,10," Not so far, but that's not the point!",3,Big Bang Theory,38,8
12015,Leonard,10," Howard, relax, I'm not interested in your girlfriend.",3,Big Bang Theory,54,8
12016,Howard,10," I hope not, because you don't want to mess with me. I'm crazy.",3,Big Bang Theory,63,13
12017,Leonard,10, I believe you.,3,Big Bang Theory,15,3
12019,Sheldon,10," Research journal, entry one. I'm about to embark on one of the great challenges of my scientific career, teaching Penny physics. I'm calling it Project Gorilla.",3,Big Bang Theory,161,26
12020,Penny,10," Hey, Sheldon.",3,Big Bang Theory,14,2
12021,Sheldon,10, Come in. Take a seat. Subject has arrived. I've extended a friendly casual greeting.,3,Big Bang Theory,85,14
12022,Penny,10, Ready to get started?,3,Big Bang Theory,22,4
12023,Sheldon,10," One moment. Subject appears well-rested and enthusiastic. Apparently, ignorance is bliss. All right, let us begin. Where's your notebook?",3,Big Bang Theory,138,19
12024,Penny,10," Um, I don't have one.",3,Big Bang Theory,22,5
12025,Sheldon,10, How are you going to take notes without a notebook?,3,Big Bang Theory,52,10
12026,Penny,10, I have to take notes?,3,Big Bang Theory,22,5
12027,Sheldon,10, How else are you gonna study for the tests?,3,Big Bang Theory,44,9
12028,Penny,10, There's gonna be a test?,3,Big Bang Theory,25,5
12029,Sheldon,10, Tests. Here. It's college-ruled. I hope that's not too intimidating.,3,Big Bang Theory,69,10
12030,Penny,10, Thank you.,3,Big Bang Theory,11,2
12031,Sheldon,10," You're welcome. Now, Introduction to Physics. What is physics? Physics comes from the ancient Greek word physika. It's at this point that you'll want to start taking notes. Physika means the science of natural things. And it is there, in ancient Greece, that our story begins.",3,Big Bang Theory,277,46
12032,Penny,10, Ancient Greece?,3,Big Bang Theory,16,2
12033,Sheldon,10," Hush. If you have questions, raise your hand. It's a warm summer evening, circa 600 BC, you've finished your shopping at the local market, or agora, and you look up at the night sky. There you notice some of the stars seem to move, so you name them planetes, or wanderer. Yes, Penny?",3,Big Bang Theory,284,53
12034,Penny,10," Um, does this have anything to do with Leonard's work?",3,Big Bang Theory,55,10
12035,Sheldon,10, This is the beginning of a twenty six hundred year journey we're going to take together from the ancient Greeks through Isaac Newton to Niels Bohr to Erwin Schrodinger to the Dutch researchers that Leonard is currently ripping off.,3,Big Bang Theory,232,39
12036,Penny,10, Twenty six hundred years?,3,Big Bang Theory,26,4
12037,Sheldon,10," Yeah, give or take. As I was saying, it's a warm summer evening in ancient Greece Yes, Penny?",3,Big Bang Theory,94,18
12038,Penny,10, I have to go to the bathroom.,3,Big Bang Theory,30,7
12039,Sheldon,10, Can't you hold it?,3,Big Bang Theory,19,4
12040,Penny,10, Not for twenty six hundred years.,3,Big Bang Theory,34,6
12041,Sheldon,10," Project Gorilla, entry two. I am exhausted.",3,Big Bang Theory,44,7
12044,Howard,10, Huh?,3,Big Bang Theory,5,1
12046,Howard,10," Oh, that explains a lot.",3,Big Bang Theory,25,5
12048,Howard,10, Of course.,3,Big Bang Theory,11,2
12050,Howard,10," That's great, Ma!",3,Big Bang Theory,18,3
12053,Howard,10," No, no, don't move. Hey, Ma, can I have lamb stew for dinner?",3,Big Bang Theory,62,13
12055,Howard,10, Please? I got a real hankering.,3,Big Bang Theory,32,6
12057,Howard,10," Thanks, Ma.",3,Big Bang Theory,12,2
12059,Howard,10, Always Le Seur peas with lamb stew!,3,Big Bang Theory,36,7
12061,Howard,10, Then get the regular!,3,Big Bang Theory,22,4
12063,Howard,10, Sorry about that.,3,Big Bang Theory,18,3
12065,Howard,10, I'm already on vibrate.,3,Big Bang Theory,24,4
12067,Howard,10," Uh, what do you mean?",3,Big Bang Theory,22,5
12069,Howard,10, Really? He said that?,3,Big Bang Theory,22,4
12071,Howard,10, Me? No. I may have mentioned that it's a little inappropriate to be asking another man's girlfriend to his experiment without first discussing it with said man.,3,Big Bang Theory,161,27
12073,Howard,10," I didn't say anything like that. I said Leonard has to ask my permission.  Come on, I don't want to eat lamb stew with my mother. Damn, I was this close on the bra.",3,Big Bang Theory,165,34
12075,Sheldon,10," Now, remember, Newton realized that Aristotle was wrong and force was not necessary to maintain motion. So let's plug in our 9.8 meters per second squared as A and we get force, Earth gravity, equals mass times 9.8 meters per second per second. So we can see that MA equals MG and what do we know from this?",3,Big Bang Theory,308,58
12076,Penny,10," Uh, we know that Newton was a really smart cookie. Oh! Is that where Fig Newtons come from?",3,Big Bang Theory,92,18
12077,Sheldon,10," No, Fig Newtons are named after a small town in Massachusetts. Don't write that down!",3,Big Bang Theory,86,15
12078,Penny,10, Sorry.,3,Big Bang Theory,7,1
12079,Sheldon,10," Now, if MA equals MG what does that imply?",3,Big Bang Theory,43,9
12080,Penny,10, I don't know.,3,Big Bang Theory,14,3
12081,Sheldon,10, How can you not know? I just told you. Have you suffered a recent blow to the head?,3,Big Bang Theory,84,18
12082,Penny,10, Hey! You don't have to be so mean!,3,Big Bang Theory,35,8
12083,Sheldon,10, I'm sorry.  Have you suffered a recent blow to the head?,3,Big Bang Theory,57,11
12084,Penny,10," No, you just suck at teaching.",3,Big Bang Theory,31,6
12085,Sheldon,10," Really? Of those two explanations, which one seems the most likely?",3,Big Bang Theory,68,11
12086,Penny,10," Oh, God, Sheldon, look I'm trying to understand, but you're going too fast. Can you just back up a little bit?",3,Big Bang Theory,111,21
12087,Sheldon,10, All right. It's a warm summer evening in ancient Greece,3,Big Bang Theory,56,10
12088,Penny,10, Not that far back!,3,Big Bang Theory,19,4
12089,Sheldon,10, Okay! At what point did you begin to feel lost?,3,Big Bang Theory,48,10
12090,Penny,10, I don't know. Where were we looking up at the night sky?,3,Big Bang Theory,57,12
12091,Sheldon,10, Greece.,3,Big Bang Theory,8,1
12092,Penny,10, Damn it!,3,Big Bang Theory,9,2
12093,Sheldon,10," There's no need to get frustrated, people learn at different rates. Unlike objects falling in a vacuum, which? MA equals MG?",3,Big Bang Theory,125,21
12094,Penny,10, Squared?,3,Big Bang Theory,9,1
12095,Sheldon,10, No.,3,Big Bang Theory,4,1
12096,Penny,10, Aristotle?,3,Big Bang Theory,11,1
12097,Sheldon,10, No.,3,Big Bang Theory,4,1
12098,Penny,10, Five?,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
12099,Sheldon,10, Oh!,3,Big Bang Theory,4,1
12100,Penny,10, Then I don't know.,3,Big Bang Theory,19,4
12101,Sheldon,10, Why are you crying?,3,Big Bang Theory,20,4
12102,Penny,10, Because I'm stupid!,3,Big Bang Theory,20,3
12103,Sheldon,10," That's no reason to cry. One cries because one is sad. For example, I cry because others are stupid and it makes me sad.",3,Big Bang Theory,121,24
12104,Penny,10," Okay, look, can we just please forget about all this extra stuff and can you just tell me what Leonard does?",3,Big Bang Theory,109,21
12105,Sheldon,10, All right. Leonard is attempting to learn why sub-atomic particles move the way they do.,3,Big Bang Theory,89,15
12106,Penny,10," Really? That's it? Well, that doesn't sound so complicated.",3,Big Bang Theory,60,9
12107,Sheldon,10, It's not. That's why Leonard does it.,3,Big Bang Theory,38,7
12108,Penny,10," Okay, I just have one question. What exactly are sub-atomic particles?",3,Big Bang Theory,71,11
12109,Sheldon,10, A good question.,3,Big Bang Theory,17,3
12110,Penny,10, Thank you.,3,Big Bang Theory,11,2
12111,Sheldon,10," And to answer it, we first must ask ourselves, what is physics?",3,Big Bang Theory,64,12
12112,Penny,10," Oh, balls.",3,Big Bang Theory,11,2
12113,Sheldon,10, It's a warm summer evening in ancient Greece,3,Big Bang Theory,45,8
12115,Howard,10," Okay, I got a bone to pick with you.",3,Big Bang Theory,37,9
12116,Leonard,10, What did I do now?,3,Big Bang Theory,19,5
12117,Howard,10," I was in bed with Bernadette, and you text-blocked me.",3,Big Bang Theory,55,10
12118,Leonard,10, What?,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
12119,Howard,10," We were completely naked, about to devour each other when, you text her that I have a problem with her hanging out with you.",3,Big Bang Theory,125,24
12120,Leonard,10, You do have a problem with her hanging out with me.,3,Big Bang Theory,52,11
12121,Howard,10," Yeah, but that's not what you tell her.",3,Big Bang Theory,40,8
12122,Leonard,10, What was I supposed to tell her?,3,Big Bang Theory,33,7
12123,Howard,10," I don't know, something that doesn't make me come off as a petty, jealous douche.",3,Big Bang Theory,82,15
12124,Leonard,10, And what would that be?,3,Big Bang Theory,24,5
12125,Howard,10," Come on, do I have to think of everything?",3,Big Bang Theory,43,9
12127,Howard,10, Hi.,3,Big Bang Theory,4,1
12129,Howard,10, Same thing you're doing here. I came to see Leonard's experiment.,3,Big Bang Theory,66,11
12131,Leonard,10, You told her my experiment was stupid?,3,Big Bang Theory,39,7
12132,Howard,10," I was just repeating what Sheldon said. Let's not get off topic, Bernadette, I need to apologize. I was wrong to tell you who you should be friends with.",3,Big Bang Theory,154,29
12133,Leonard,10," Should I, um, leave you two alone?",3,Big Bang Theory,35,7
12135,Leonard,10," Okay, good, 'cause I wasn't really gonna go.",3,Big Bang Theory,45,8
12136,Howard,10," Look, I know I come off as confident and worldly, but the truth is I'm not.",3,Big Bang Theory,76,16
12137,Leonard,10, We're shocked.,3,Big Bang Theory,15,2
12138,Howard,10, Which is why I tend to feel threatened by other guys.,3,Big Bang Theory,54,11
12139,Leonard,10," Or loud noises, clowns and nuns.",3,Big Bang Theory,33,6
12140,Howard,10, But I now realize how foolish that is.,3,Big Bang Theory,39,8
12141,Leonard,10, He had a panic attack once when he got his head stuck in a sweater.,3,Big Bang Theory,68,15
12142,Howard,10, It was a full turtleneck. Why aren't you helping me?,3,Big Bang Theory,53,10
12143,Leonard,10, I don't know. Maybe because I'm crazy?,3,Big Bang Theory,39,7
12144,Howard,10," Bernadette, please, I'm asking you to give me another chance.",3,Big Bang Theory,62,10
12146,Leonard,10, It's up to you. He didn't call your experiment stupid.,3,Big Bang Theory,55,10
12148,Leonard,10," Tushy face, that is going on Twitter right now.",3,Big Bang Theory,48,9
12151,Leonard,10, I'm glad you enjoyed it. Most people aren't that interested in what I do.,3,Big Bang Theory,74,14
12152,Penny,10," Actually, that's not true, Leonard. In fact, recently I've been thinking that given the parameters of your experiment, the transport of electrons through the aperture the nano-fabricated metal rings is qualitatively no different than the experiment already conducted in the Netherlands. Their observed phase shift in the diffusing electrons inside the metal ring already conclusively demonstrated the electric analogue of the Aharonov-Bohm quantum-interference effect. That's it. That's all I know. Oh, wait! Fig Newtons were named after a town in Massachusetts, not the scientist.",3,Big Bang Theory,582,84
12154,Penny,11," Oh, I always tear up when the Grinch's heart grows three sizes.",3,Big Bang Theory,64,12
12155,Sheldon,11," Tears seem appropriate. Enlargement of the heart muscle, or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, is a serious disease which could lead to congestive heart failure.",3,Big Bang Theory,156,22
12156,Leonard,11," Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la.",3,Big Bang Theory,30,3
12157,Penny,11," You really didn't like it, Sheldon?",3,Big Bang Theory,36,6
12158,Sheldon,11," No, on the contrary. I found the Grinch to be a relatable, engaging character, and I was really with him right up to the point that he succumbed to social convention and returned the presents and saved Christmas. What a buzz kill that was.",3,Big Bang Theory,240,44
12159,Leonard,11," When we watch Frosty the Snowman, he roots for the sun.",3,Big Bang Theory,56,11
12160,Sheldon,11," Excuse me, but the sun is essential for all life on Earth. Frosty is merely a bit of frozen supernatural ephemera in a stolen hat. A crime, by the way, for which he is never brought to account.",3,Big Bang Theory,194,38
12161,Leonard,11," Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la.",3,Big Bang Theory,29,2
12163,Penny,11, I just love decorating the Christmas tree. It makes me feel like a little girl again.,3,Big Bang Theory,86,16
12164,Leonard,11, We didn't have a tree when I was growing up.,3,Big Bang Theory,45,10
12165,Penny,11, Really? Why not?,3,Big Bang Theory,17,3
12166,Leonard,11," Mmm, in my family, holidays weren't so much celebrated as studied for their anthropological and psychological implications on human society.",3,Big Bang Theory,141,20
12167,Penny,11," Oh, sounds festive. Did you at least give presents?",3,Big Bang Theory,52,9
12168,Leonard,11," Mmm, in a way. We presented papers, and then broke off into focus groups and critiqued each other.",3,Big Bang Theory,99,18
12169,Penny,11," Sheldon, what about you? Did you have a Christmas tree?",3,Big Bang Theory,56,10
12170,Sheldon,11," Oh, yes. We had a tree, we had a manger, we had an inflatable Santa Claus with plastic reindeer on the front lawn. And to make things even more jolly, there were so many blinking lights on the house they induced neighbourhood-wide seizures.",3,Big Bang Theory,241,43
12171,Penny,11, So I take it you don't want to help us trim the tree.,3,Big Bang Theory,54,13
12172,Sheldon,11, I do not. But if you insist on decorating a spider-infested fire hazard in my home I would request that you add this.,3,Big Bang Theory,118,23
12173,Penny,11, What is it?,3,Big Bang Theory,12,3
12174,Sheldon,11," You're kidding, right? It's a bust of Sir Isaac Newton.",3,Big Bang Theory,56,10
12175,Penny,11," Oh, sure, sure, yeah. Very Christmassy.",3,Big Bang Theory,40,6
12176,Sheldon,11," Wait, excuse me, but it's much more Christmassy than anything you've put on the tree.",3,Big Bang Theory,86,15
12177,Leonard,11, Here we go.,3,Big Bang Theory,12,3
12178,Sheldon,11," December 25, 1642, Julian calendar, Sir Isaac Newton is born. Jesus, on the other hand, was actually born in the summer. His birthday was moved to coincide with a traditional pagan holiday that celebrated the winter solstice with lit fires and slaughtered goats. Which, frankly, sounds like more fun than 12 hours of church with my mother followed by a fruitcake.",3,Big Bang Theory,364,61
12179,Leonard,11," Merry Newton-mas, everyone.",3,Big Bang Theory,28,3
12180,Sheldon,11," I sense that's not sincere, although I have no idea why.",3,Big Bang Theory,57,11
12181,Penny,11," No, it's fine. Look, Sir Isaac can go right next to this little candy cane.",3,Big Bang Theory,76,15
12182,Sheldon,11, No. Isaac goes at the top of the tree.,3,Big Bang Theory,39,9
12183,Leonard,11," No, he doesn't.",3,Big Bang Theory,16,3
12184,Sheldon,11, I understand. You dispute Newton's claim that he invented calculus and you want to put Gottfried Leibniz on the top.,3,Big Bang Theory,117,20
12185,Leonard,11," Yeah, you got me. I'm a Leibniz man.",3,Big Bang Theory,37,8
12186,Sheldon,11," Well, perhaps when your mother gets here, she'll talk some sense into you.",3,Big Bang Theory,75,13
12187,Penny,11, What? Your your mother's coming? When?,3,Big Bang Theory,39,6
12188,Leonard,11, Tomorrow.,3,Big Bang Theory,10,1
12189,Penny,11, When were you going to tell me?,3,Big Bang Theory,32,7
12190,Leonard,11," Um, tomorrow?",3,Big Bang Theory,14,2
12191,Penny,11, Why were you keeping this a secret?,3,Big Bang Theory,36,7
12192,Leonard,11," Well, I just, I thought",3,Big Bang Theory,24,5
12193,Sheldon,11," If I can interject here, obviously Leonard is concerned that his mother won't approve of you as his mate.",3,Big Bang Theory,106,19
12194,Penny,11, Why wouldn't she approve of me? I'm adorable.,3,Big Bang Theory,46,8
12195,Leonard,11," You are, it's just",3,Big Bang Theory,19,4
12196,Sheldon,11," If I can interject again. Leonard comes from a remarkably high-achieving family, who have all chosen high-achieving partners. He probably feels that it's doubtful that his mother will be overly impressed with his dating a woman whose most significant achievement is memorizing the Cheesecake Factory menu.",3,Big Bang Theory,306,46
12197,Penny,11," Hey, it's a big menu. There's two pages just for desserts.",3,Big Bang Theory,59,11
12198,Leonard,11," I know. And those specials, they change every day.",3,Big Bang Theory,51,9
12199,Penny,11," Okay, you know what? It's lame when I say it, it's just ridiculous when you pile on.",3,Big Bang Theory,85,17
12200,Leonard,11," Okay, sorry.",3,Big Bang Theory,13,2
12201,Penny,11, So what did she say when you told her we were going out?,3,Big Bang Theory,57,13
12202,Leonard,11, Um,3,Big Bang Theory,3,1
12203,Penny,11," You didn't tell her we were going out, did you?",3,Big Bang Theory,48,10
12204,Leonard,11, Um,3,Big Bang Theory,3,1
12205,Penny,11, Why not?,3,Big Bang Theory,9,2
12206,Leonard,11, Um,3,Big Bang Theory,3,1
12207,Sheldon,11," Leonard, I'm no expert on meditation, but if you're trying to calm yourself down, I believe the word is Om.",3,Big Bang Theory,108,20
12210,Sheldon,11, No trouble at all.,3,Big Bang Theory,19,4
12211,Leonard,11," I drove, Mother. I'm driving now.",3,Big Bang Theory,34,6
12213,Sheldon,11," My pleasure. For a non-physicist, you have a remarkable grasp of how electric dipoles in the brain's water molecules could not possibly form a Bose condensate.",3,Big Bang Theory,160,26
12214,Leonard,11," Wait, wait, wait. When did you send my mom notes on a paper?",3,Big Bang Theory,61,13
12215,Sheldon,11, August 16th. Right after her carpal tunnel surgery.,3,Big Bang Theory,52,8
12217,Sheldon,11, You did.,3,Big Bang Theory,9,2
12219,Sheldon,11," Neither do I, but it's the social convention.",3,Big Bang Theory,46,8
12221,Leonard,11," Wait, wait, wait. You had surgery?",3,Big Bang Theory,35,6
12223,Leonard,11," No, I heard that.",3,Big Bang Theory,18,4
12225,Leonard,11, I just don't understand why he knows more about your life than I do.,3,Big Bang Theory,69,14
12227,Sheldon,11, It's what we think caused your narcissistic personality disorder. We discussed it at length during our last video chat. Although how we got onto the subject of you is baffling.,3,Big Bang Theory,177,30
12229,Leonard,11," Fine, Mom. How are you?",3,Big Bang Theory,24,5
12231,Leonard,11, Now I'm less fine.,3,Big Bang Theory,19,4
12233,Leonard,11," No. Sheldon, why didn't you tell me?",3,Big Bang Theory,37,7
12234,Sheldon,11, My bad. I did send a gift from both of us.,3,Big Bang Theory,43,11
12236,Leonard,11, You must be very happy.,3,Big Bang Theory,24,5
12238,Sheldon,11," Well, I'm not sure about interesting, but",3,Big Bang Theory,42,7
12239,Leonard,11," Not the time, Sheldon.",3,Big Bang Theory,23,4
12240,Sheldon,11, Very well. Shall we switch topics to Isaac Newton v. Gottfried Leibniz?,3,Big Bang Theory,72,12
12242,Sheldon,11," Isn't she brilliant, Leonard? How I envy you.",3,Big Bang Theory,46,8
12245,Howard,11, What? No.,3,Big Bang Theory,10,2
12247,Howard,11, Because we don't have latent homosexual feelings toward one another.,3,Big Bang Theory,69,10
12249,Howard,11," No, really. I have a girlfriend now.",3,Big Bang Theory,37,7
12251,Howard,11, She had to go out of town. Her grandmother died.,3,Big Bang Theory,49,10
12253,Howard,11," Honest to God. Leonard, tell her I have a girlfriend.",3,Big Bang Theory,54,10
12254,Leonard,11, I don't know what you're talking about.,3,Big Bang Theory,40,7
12255,Howard,11, What do you mean you don't know what I'm talking about? Tell her I have a girlfriend!,3,Big Bang Theory,86,17
12256,Leonard,11, All right. He â€œhasâ€ù a â€œgirlfriend.â€ù,3,Big Bang Theory,44,6
12257,Howard,11," Her name is Bernadette, she's working as a waitress, but she's going to school to be a microbiologist.",3,Big Bang Theory,103,18
12259,Howard,11, Do you really think your lips in my ear is helping?,3,Big Bang Theory,52,11
12260,Penny,11, Hi. Sorry I'm late.,3,Big Bang Theory,20,4
12261,Leonard,11," Oh, glad you're here, uh, sit down, I'll get you a plate. Mom, you remember Penny.",3,Big Bang Theory,83,16
12263,Penny,11," Well, he sent me a football and a catcher's mitt for Christmas, so I'm going to say no.",3,Big Bang Theory,88,18
12264,Howard,11," If it helps, we're all good with your breasts.",3,Big Bang Theory,47,9
12266,Leonard,11, What?,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
12268,Leonard,11, No!,3,Big Bang Theory,4,1
12270,Penny,11," No, it sounded like a compliment.",3,Big Bang Theory,34,6
12271,Leonard,11, When did this happen?,3,Big Bang Theory,22,4
12273,Sheldon,11, September 22nd.,3,Big Bang Theory,16,2
12275,Leonard,11, Mitzy's dead?,3,Big Bang Theory,14,2
12276,Sheldon,11," She was old and blind, Leonard. What choice did we have?",3,Big Bang Theory,57,11
12277,Leonard,11, I don't believe this. Why am I the last to know?,3,Big Bang Theory,49,11
12279,Leonard,11," You're right. I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm sorry, I'm way out of line!",3,Big Bang Theory,58,9
12281,Penny,11, Nothing. Not a damn thing.,3,Big Bang Theory,27,5
12284,Penny,11," Oh, it's not a problem.",3,Big Bang Theory,24,5
12286,Penny,11," No, you do not.",3,Big Bang Theory,16,4
12288,Penny,11," Yeah, I gotta put a sticker over that. So, uh, you must be devastated about your divorce.",3,Big Bang Theory,90,17
12290,Penny,11," Come on, I mean, you're not upset that your marriage is over?",3,Big Bang Theory,62,12
12292,Penny,11," Sure, sure.",3,Big Bang Theory,12,2
12294,Penny,11, Eight years?,3,Big Bang Theory,13,2
12296,Penny,11, Yikes. What's so funny?,3,Big Bang Theory,24,4
12298,Penny,11, You know what? I could use a drink. Do you want to stop for a drink?,3,Big Bang Theory,69,16
12300,Penny,11," I do, I'll teach you.",3,Big Bang Theory,22,5
12302,Sheldon,11,  Leonard?  Leonard?  Leonard?,3,Big Bang Theory,30,3
12303,Leonard,11, I don't want tea.,3,Big Bang Theory,18,4
12304,Sheldon,11, I didn't make tea for you. This is my tea.,3,Big Bang Theory,43,10
12305,Leonard,11, Then why are you telling me?,3,Big Bang Theory,29,6
12306,Sheldon,11, It's a conversation starter.,3,Big Bang Theory,29,4
12307,Leonard,11, That's a lousy conversation starter.,3,Big Bang Theory,37,5
12308,Sheldon,11," Oh, is it? We're conversing. Checkmate.",3,Big Bang Theory,40,6
12309,Leonard,11," What do you want, Sheldon?",3,Big Bang Theory,27,5
12310,Sheldon,11, What I want is to be departing the Starship Enterprise in a one-man shuttle craft headed to the planetoid I rule known as Sheldon Alpha Five.,3,Big Bang Theory,142,26
12311,Leonard,11, I want that too. Why are you here?,3,Big Bang Theory,35,8
12312,Sheldon,11," To comfort you, of course. No, that's not going to work at all, I'll comfort you from over here. Leonard, what you're experiencing is a classic Jungian crisis in which the aging individual mourns the loss of the never-to-be realized ideal family unit.",3,Big Bang Theory,252,43
12313,Leonard,11," Thank you, that's very comforting.",3,Big Bang Theory,35,5
12314,Sheldon,11, That's not the comforting part.,3,Big Bang Theory,32,5
12315,Leonard,11, It's not?,3,Big Bang Theory,10,2
12316,Sheldon,11," No, no. The comforting part is that the Germans have a term for what you're feeling. Weltschmerz. It means the depression that arises from comparing the world as it is to a hypothetical, idealized world.",3,Big Bang Theory,204,35
12317,Leonard,11," You're right, I do feel better.",3,Big Bang Theory,32,6
12318,Sheldon,11," Well, the Germans have always been a comforting people. Just remember, Leonard, where your biological family has failed you, you always have me, your surrogate family.",3,Big Bang Theory,168,26
12319,Leonard,11, You're my surrogate family?,3,Big Bang Theory,28,4
12320,Sheldon,11," If it's any consolation, I'm not happy about it either. Good night.",3,Big Bang Theory,68,12
12322,Penny,11," Okay, now this time try drinking it all at once.",3,Big Bang Theory,49,10
12324,Penny,11, I've been responsible for my own buzz since 2003. Another round for me and my homegirl.,3,Big Bang Theory,88,16
12326,Penny,11," As long as you don't feel it running down your pants, you're fine.",3,Big Bang Theory,67,13
12328,Penny,11," Well, we are known for our cheesecake. Hit us again.",3,Big Bang Theory,53,10
12330,Penny,11," Hey, Bev, guess what?",3,Big Bang Theory,22,4
12332,Penny,11, I'm sleeping with your son.,3,Big Bang Theory,28,5
12334,Penny,11, The one from whom I live across the hall from.,3,Big Bang Theory,47,10
12336,Penny,11," Oh, Beverly, I can't talk to my boyfriend's mother about his penis.",3,Big Bang Theory,68,12
12338,Penny,11," Actually, I've only had the cheesecake. One more time. You know, Leonard did not want to tell you we were dating.",3,Big Bang Theory,114,21
12340,Penny,11," Well, let's go find out who.",3,Big Bang Theory,29,6
12343,Penny,11, Leonard?,3,Big Bang Theory,9,1
12345,Penny,11, Get out here! Your mommy wants to talk to you!,3,Big Bang Theory,47,10
12346,Leonard,11, What the hell is going on?,3,Big Bang Theory,27,6
12347,Penny,11, You're in trouble.,3,Big Bang Theory,19,3
12349,Penny,11," Yeah, not bad, not bad.",3,Big Bang Theory,24,5
12350,Leonard,11, Are you guys drunk?,3,Big Bang Theory,20,4
12352,Penny,11," Oh, thank you.",3,Big Bang Theory,15,3
12354,Penny,11, What the hell happened to lovely and charming?,3,Big Bang Theory,47,8
12355,Leonard,11, How come you didn't tell me that you and Father were getting a divorce? How come you didn't tell me you had surgery? How come you didn't tell me my dog died?,3,Big Bang Theory,158,32
12357,Leonard,11, I do.,3,Big Bang Theory,6,2
12359,Penny,11, That's the Del Taco.,3,Big Bang Theory,21,4
12360,Sheldon,11, Why is Leonard softly banging his head against his bedroom door?,3,Big Bang Theory,65,11
12364,Sheldon,11, You're very welcome.,3,Big Bang Theory,21,3
12365,Leonard,11," Once again, I'm driving. I'm right here.",3,Big Bang Theory,41,7
12367,Sheldon,11, I don't blame you. You were intoxicated.,3,Big Bang Theory,41,7
12369,Sheldon,11, I blame Penny.,3,Big Bang Theory,15,3
12370,Penny,11," I blame Penny, too. Bad Penny.",3,Big Bang Theory,31,6
12371,Leonard,11," Wait a minute, what are you talking about? What inappropriate behaviour?",3,Big Bang Theory,73,11
12373,Sheldon,11, Agreed.,3,Big Bang Theory,8,1
12374,Penny,11, Agreed.,3,Big Bang Theory,8,1
12375,Leonard,11," What the hell, agreed.",3,Big Bang Theory,23,4
12377,Penny,11," Oh, thank you, Beverly.",3,Big Bang Theory,24,4
12379,Leonard,11," Mother, remember when I was complaining that you don't communicate with me enough?",3,Big Bang Theory,83,13
12381,Leonard,11, I'm over it.,3,Big Bang Theory,13,3
12382,Penny,11," Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la la-la.",3,Big Bang Theory,29,3
12384,Leonard,12, Look at us. Getting ready for a double date with actual women who publicly acknowledge they're our girlfriends.,3,Big Bang Theory,112,18
12385,Howard,12," Yes, actual women are the best.",3,Big Bang Theory,32,6
12386,Sheldon,12, I don't understand. What other kind of women are there?,3,Big Bang Theory,56,10
12387,Leonard,12," Howard, artificial women are your department. You want to take this?",3,Big Bang Theory,69,11
12388,Howard,12," No, it would just freak him out. Listen, before we leave, I should warn you, I'm a passionate man and I tend towards public displays of affection.",3,Big Bang Theory,147,27
12389,Leonard,12," What are you trying to tell me, Howard?",3,Big Bang Theory,40,8
12390,Howard,12," There might be some making out in the car or the restaurant, and I don't want Bernadette to feel uncomfortable, so it would help if you and Penny made out, too.",3,Big Bang Theory,161,31
12391,Leonard,12, Don't worry. We're planning to have sex right on the salad bar.,3,Big Bang Theory,64,12
12392,Raj,12," Namaste, white people. Good news! I rented us the four-hour edition of Watchmen.",3,Big Bang Theory,81,13
12393,Leonard,12, Got it.,3,Big Bang Theory,8,2
12394,Howard,12, Seen it.,3,Big Bang Theory,9,2
12395,Sheldon,12, Detailed analysis posted online.,3,Big Bang Theory,33,4
12396,Raj,12," Well, then what are we going to do tonight?",3,Big Bang Theory,44,9
12397,Leonard,12," Uh, sorry, Raj. Howard and I are going out to dinner with Penny and Bernadette.",3,Big Bang Theory,80,15
12398,Howard,12," Yeah, no more carefree bachelor nights for me and Leonard. These broncos have been saddled.",3,Big Bang Theory,92,15
12399,Leonard,12, How did we get actual women?,3,Big Bang Theory,29,6
12400,Raj,12," Great. They get girlfriends, and they just abandon us?",3,Big Bang Theory,55,9
12401,Sheldon,12," It is great, isn't it? We have a wonderful evening ahead of us.",3,Big Bang Theory,64,13
12402,Raj,12, We do?,3,Big Bang Theory,7,2
12403,Sheldon,12," Oh, yes. I just discovered I don't have enough room on my hard drive for a Linux partition, so you and I are going to perform a full backup, reinitialize and then reinstall all my operating systems.",3,Big Bang Theory,199,37
12404,Raj,12, I don't want to do that.,3,Big Bang Theory,25,6
12405,Sheldon,12," All right. Well, I'm going to perform full backup, reinitialize and then reinstall all my operating systems.",3,Big Bang Theory,109,17
12406,Raj,12, What about me?,3,Big Bang Theory,15,3
12407,Sheldon,12," Well, I understand there are several types of artificial women. Maybe you should look into that.",3,Big Bang Theory,97,16
12409,Raj,12," Dude, there's so many cool things we could be doing tonight. Look. At the Glendale Galleria, put on your best zoot suit, it's a salute to Swing music in the center court near Macy's. 5pm to 9pm, huh, huh? A salute to zoot. Sounds like a hoot.",3,Big Bang Theory,243,47
12410,Sheldon,12," I'm sorry, Raj, I have no desire to salute any article of clothing tonight. Much less one that's linked to race riots in the 1940s.",3,Big Bang Theory,132,25
12411,Raj,12, Race riots?,3,Big Bang Theory,12,2
12412,Sheldon,12, The zoot suit riots.,3,Big Bang Theory,21,4
12413,Raj,12," Oh. I always thought that was some sort of after-Christmas sale. Well, then why don't we just go to the galleria and walk around?",3,Big Bang Theory,130,24
12414,Sheldon,12, I don't need anything at the Galleria. Do you need anything at the Galleria?,3,Big Bang Theory,77,14
12415,Raj,12, No. We would just walk around and see what's what.,3,Big Bang Theory,51,10
12416,Sheldon,12, That's a semantically null sentence.,3,Big Bang Theory,37,5
12417,Raj,12," Okay, well, how about this? From the university Web site, 7pm to 10pm, Norton Hall Multipurpose Room, mixer for grad students and faculty of the science and humanities departments. Whether you split atoms or infinitives, this is the place to be.",3,Big Bang Theory,246,41
12418,Sheldon,12," Well, that's certainly amusing, but I have no interest.",3,Big Bang Theory,56,9
12419,Raj,12," Come on, Sheldon, the world is filled with people doing things outside. Let's go outside. Outside is good.",3,Big Bang Theory,107,18
12420,Sheldon,12," If outside is so good, why has mankind spent thousands of years trying to perfect inside?",3,Big Bang Theory,90,16
12421,Raj,12," I don't know, it's a marketing scheme. Please, Sheldon, I'm a young, virile visitor from a foreign land and I need to strut my stuff.",3,Big Bang Theory,134,25
12422,Sheldon,12," Let me offer you a compromise. Sometimes when I feel stifled and want a change of scenery, I use my imagination.",3,Big Bang Theory,113,21
12423,Raj,12," Oh, boy.",3,Big Bang Theory,9,2
12424,Sheldon,12," One of my favourite places to visit is the two-dimensional world described in Edwin Abbott's mathematical fantasy, Flatland.",3,Big Bang Theory,125,18
12425,Raj,12, I don't want to go to Flatland.,3,Big Bang Theory,32,7
12426,Sheldon,12, You're only saying that because you haven't been there. I am now a hexagon in two-dimensional space and can only perceive the edges of other objects.,3,Big Bang Theory,150,26
12427,Raj,12, Oy.,3,Big Bang Theory,4,1
12428,Sheldon,12," Is that you, Raj? I don't recognize your edge.",3,Big Bang Theory,47,9
12429,Raj,12," Sheldon, I'm begging you. I want to go to this mixer, and I don't want to go alone.",3,Big Bang Theory,84,18
12430,Sheldon,12," Well, you're in luck, there's a mixer here in Flatland. Oh, look, there's a sexually attractive line segment, you should chat her up.",3,Big Bang Theory,134,23
12431,Raj,12, What?,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
12432,Sheldon,12," Tell her you're a circle, Flatland gals are all hot for circles.",3,Big Bang Theory,65,12
12434,Leonard,12," I hope you're hungry, Bernadette, we're going to a terrific restaurant.",3,Big Bang Theory,72,11
12436,Howard,12," Flesh-eating bacteria. And yet, I still want to kiss this woman, what does that tell you?",3,Big Bang Theory,90,16
12437,Penny,12, That you'd be willing to die a horrible death on the off-chance you'd get to second base?,3,Big Bang Theory,90,17
12439,Howard,12," Well, we kind of disagree about what the bases are.",3,Big Bang Theory,52,10
12441,Penny,12," Well, the last big thing I did was this production of Diary of Anne Frank above a bowling alley. But I think things might be turning around pretty soon.",3,Big Bang Theory,153,29
12442,Leonard,12, Great. How come?,3,Big Bang Theory,17,3
12443,Penny,12," Well, promise you won't make fun of me.",3,Big Bang Theory,40,8
12444,Leonard,12," Of course, I would never make fun of you.",3,Big Bang Theory,42,9
12445,Penny,12," Okay. Well, I went to this psychic who told me that if I cut my hair, I'm going to get a national commercial.",3,Big Bang Theory,110,23
12446,Leonard,12, Seriously? You're getting career advice from a psychic?,3,Big Bang Theory,56,8
12447,Howard,12, Good job not making fun of her.,3,Big Bang Theory,32,7
12448,Penny,12," She's not one of those phonies, okay. She wrote a book and has her own Web site.",3,Big Bang Theory,81,17
12449,Leonard,12," Oh, gee, why didn't you say so? They don't let just anyone have a Web site.",3,Big Bang Theory,76,16
12450,Penny,12, Why are you being such a jerk?,3,Big Bang Theory,31,7
12451,Leonard,12, You're surprised? Your psychic didn't tell you I was going to be a jerk?,3,Big Bang Theory,73,14
12452,Penny,12," Ha-ha, bite me.",3,Big Bang Theory,16,3
12453,Leonard,12," Come on, Penny.",3,Big Bang Theory,16,3
12454,Howard,12, Why don't you kids go ahead and chat? We're gonna make out back here.,3,Big Bang Theory,70,14

12458,Sheldon,12, Thanks for giving me your limited edition Green Lantern lantern.,3,Big Bang Theory,65,10
12459,Raj,12, Did you really have to bring it in with you?,3,Big Bang Theory,45,10
12460,Sheldon,12, What if evil strikes and my power ring runs low?,3,Big Bang Theory,49,10
12461,Raj,12," Come on, let's get a drink.",3,Big Bang Theory,28,6
12462,Sheldon,12, I don't drink.,3,Big Bang Theory,15,3
12463,Raj,12," Yeah, well I do. And when my wingman is carrying a Green Lantern lantern, I drink a lot. I'll have a screwdriver, please. Don't be chintzy with the screw.",3,Big Bang Theory,155,29
12464,Sheldon,12, I would like a root beer float.,3,Big Bang Theory,32,7
12465,Raj,12," Sheldon, they don't have ice cream.",3,Big Bang Theory,36,6
12466,Sheldon,12," They don't? Well, apparently, these people and I differ greatly on the definition of party.",3,Big Bang Theory,92,15
12467,Raj,12, He'll have a Shirley Temple.,3,Big Bang Theory,29,5
12468,Sheldon,12, And don't be chintzy with the Shirley.,3,Big Bang Theory,39,7
12469,Raj,12," Okay, let's check out the females.",3,Big Bang Theory,35,6
12470,Sheldon,12, All right. There's a female.,3,Big Bang Theory,29,5
12471,Raj,12," That's Professor Wilkinson's wife, she's like 80 years old.",3,Big Bang Theory,60,9
12472,Sheldon,12, But she's female. Isn't that the game?,3,Big Bang Theory,39,7
12473,Raj,12, No. I'm looking for a hookup.,3,Big Bang Theory,30,6
12474,Sheldon,12," Oh, yes. So, the point of this exercise is for you to find someone to copulate with?",3,Big Bang Theory,85,17
12475,Raj,12," Not so loud, but ideally, yes. Thanks.",3,Big Bang Theory,39,7
12476,Sheldon,12, Thank you. And what is my function as wingman?,3,Big Bang Theory,47,9
12477,Raj,12, You help me run my game.,3,Big Bang Theory,25,6
12478,Sheldon,12, Okay. What is your game?,3,Big Bang Theory,25,5
12479,Sheldon,12," When I lie through my teeth to a woman, you nod and agree.",3,Big Bang Theory,59,13
12481,Sheldon,12, It's a limited edition Green Lantern lantern. My friend is looking for someone to copulate with.,3,Big Bang Theory,97,16
12483,Sheldon,12, I'm Sheldon. How do you do?,3,Big Bang Theory,28,6
12484,Raj,12, How do you do? Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali. Call me Raj.,3,Big Bang Theory,57,10
12486,Raj,12, The mysterious subcontinent of India.,3,Big Bang Theory,38,5
12488,Raj,12, You know India?,3,Big Bang Theory,16,3
12490,Raj,12," Well, I'm a slumdog astrophysicist.",3,Big Bang Theory,36,5
12491,Sheldon,12, I thought your father was a gynaecologist. I'm sorry. ,3,Big Bang Theory,55,9
12494,Raj,12, Hello.,3,Big Bang Theory,7,1

12499,Sheldon,12, Thank you. Have you chosen one to copulate with?,3,Big Bang Theory,49,9
12502,Howard,12," Well, we could always learn more about why people who believe in psychics are idiots. Leonard?",3,Big Bang Theory,95,16
12503,Penny,12," Oh, we don't need to talk about that anymore. Leonard covered it pretty well in the car.",3,Big Bang Theory,89,17
12504,Leonard,12," I'm sorry, but facts are facts.",3,Big Bang Theory,32,6
12505,Penny,12," Right, and if you can't understand it, it's not a fact.",3,Big Bang Theory,56,11
12506,Leonard,12," No, if it's not a fact, it's not a fact.",3,Big Bang Theory,41,10
12507,Penny,12," Oh, got it. Thank you for educating me.",3,Big Bang Theory,40,8
12508,Leonard,12, You're welcome. How's your fish?,3,Big Bang Theory,33,5

12511,Penny,12," Well, the fact is, you can't.",3,Big Bang Theory,30,6
12512,Leonard,12," Come on, Howard, Bernadette, you're both scientists. Help me out here.",3,Big Bang Theory,71,11
12513,Howard,12, What do you think? Want to jump right into the middle of another couple's argument?,3,Big Bang Theory,84,15
12515,Howard,12, Sorry.,3,Big Bang Theory,7,1
12516,Leonard,12, Maybe we should just stop talking about this.,3,Big Bang Theory,46,8
12517,Penny,12, Maybe some of us should stop talking altogether.,3,Big Bang Theory,49,8
12521,Leonard,12," You know, the best thing about being in a committed, monogamous, mutually supportive relationship is that even if you have different ideas, you can have a spirited debate, yet still care for, even make love with  Want your fish?  I knew you were going to do that. Doesn't make me psychic! Attaboy, Leonard, make it worse. ",3,Big Bang Theory,323,56
12522,Leonard,12, What's going on?,3,Big Bang Theory,17,3
12523,Sheldon,12, We scored. I'm the wingman.,3,Big Bang Theory,28,5
12525,Howard,12, Hey.,3,Big Bang Theory,5,1
12526,Leonard,12, Laser.,3,Big Bang Theory,7,1

12528,Leonard,12, What the hell is eighth base?,3,Big Bang Theory,30,6
12529,Howard,12," Seventh base with shirt off. Well, my shirt. How'd things go with Penny?",3,Big Bang Theory,73,13
12530,Leonard,12," Oh, couldn't be better.",3,Big Bang Theory,24,4
12531,Howard,12, Are we taking our relationship frustrations out on innocent Cylons?,3,Big Bang Theory,68,10
12532,Leonard,12, It's not just Cylons. Superman's next.,3,Big Bang Theory,39,6
12533,Howard,12," All right, I was going to try to squeeze in a little more mocking before lunch, but I can come back later when you don't have a high-powered weapon.",3,Big Bang Theory,149,29
12534,Leonard,12, How can I go out with a woman who believes in psychics?,3,Big Bang Theory,56,12
12535,Howard,12," Hey, I once dated a girl who believed she was abducted by aliens.",3,Big Bang Theory,66,13
12536,Leonard,12, And that didn't bother you?,3,Big Bang Theory,28,5
12537,Howard,12, Au contraire. It meant she was gullible and open to a little probing.,3,Big Bang Theory,70,13
12538,Leonard,12," What am I supposed to do, pretend I believe something I don't whenever I'm with Penny?",3,Big Bang Theory,87,16
12539,Howard,12," Hey, I'm sure Penny fakes all kinds of things when she's with you.",3,Big Bang Theory,67,13
12540,Leonard,12," Do me a favour, lean over, put your head right here.",3,Big Bang Theory,53,11
12541,Howard,12, Let me show you another way to look at this. Here we have the universe of all women. These are the ones you want to sleep with. These are the women who believe exactly what you believe. These are the women who would be willing to sleep with you. And right there in the,3,Big Bang Theory,269,54
12542,Leonard,12," What's your point? In order to keep having a sexual relationship with Penny, I have to give up everything I believe in, my intellectual integrity, the very nature of who I am? I can't do that, Howard.",3,Big Bang Theory,201,37
12543,Howard,12, I respect that.  ,3,Big Bang Theory,18,3
12544,Leonard,12, What is that?,3,Big Bang Theory,14,3

12548,Raj,12, What was that?,3,Big Bang Theory,15,3
12549,Sheldon,12," It means come in. It's taking forever to load the new operating system on my computer. I disinfected the kitchen and the bathroom, and now I thought I'd learn Finnish.",3,Big Bang Theory,168,30

12551,Sheldon,12, I don't say anything. I merely offer you a facial expression that suggests you've gone insane.,3,Big Bang Theory,95,16
12552,Raj,12, I don't get it. You had a great time.,3,Big Bang Theory,38,9
12553,Sheldon,12," Yes, exactly, I had a great time. That's done, I've moved on to other things. For example, after I learn Finnish, I'm not going to learn Finnish again.",3,Big Bang Theory,152,28
12554,Raj,12," Please, Sheldon, I'm a lost Indian boy far from home, and I want a girlfriend and I want her to be Abby, and she'll only come over if she can bring Martha.",3,Big Bang Theory,156,32
12555,Sheldon,12," Raj, I highly doubt there is any argument you can make, threat you might levy, rhetorical strategy, plea, invocation, supplication, or vetoomus that you can employ that would convince me to reconsider.",3,Big Bang Theory,202,32
12556,Raj,12, My Incredible Hulk hands signed by Stan Lee.,3,Big Bang Theory,45,8

12561,Sheldon,12, Hulk sad.,3,Big Bang Theory,10,2
12563,Leonard,12," Hey. Cleaning out the old dryer lint, huh? Not only is it courteous, it's safety smart. Every year, 15,000 fires are caused by accidental dryer lint ignition. Now you're supposed to say, wow, what an interesting fact. Come here, you crazy, nerdy guy. I could never be mad at you.",3,Big Bang Theory,280,50

12568,Penny,12, I would not.,3,Big Bang Theory,13,3
12569,Leonard,12," Okay, let's go see your psychic.",3,Big Bang Theory,33,6

12578,Penny,12," Oh, no, no, no, crystals don't work.",3,Big Bang Theory,37,7
12579,Leonard,12," Really, that's the line? Psychics are real, but crystals are voodoo?",3,Big Bang Theory,69,11
12580,Penny,12," Oh, voodoo's real. You don't want to mess with voodoo.",3,Big Bang Theory,55,10

12596,Howard,13," A little jealous, are we?",3,Big Bang Theory,26,5
12597,Raj,13," No, I'm not jealous. All right, I'd kill a hobo if it'll get me laid. Now, can we order?",3,Big Bang Theory,89,19
12598,Sheldon,13," Oh, dear Lord, they re-did the menu.",3,Big Bang Theory,37,7
12599,Leonard,13, So what? It's the same food.,3,Big Bang Theory,29,6
12600,Sheldon,13," Oh, is it? Look at this. General Tso's Chicken is no longer listed under specialties. It's now under chicken.",3,Big Bang Theory,110,19
12601,Raj,13, So?,3,Big Bang Theory,4,1

12603,Raj,13," Not Tso the chicken, so the question. So?",3,Big Bang Theory,42,8
12604,Sheldon,13," So, why is it no longer a specialty? Did the chef lose confidence in the dish or himself? And look over here, shrimp in mobster sauce. What is mobster sauce?",3,Big Bang Theory,158,30
12605,Leonard,13, It's obviously a typo.,3,Big Bang Theory,23,4
12606,Sheldon,13," Perhaps. Perhaps this restaurant's now a front for organized crime. For all we know, the mobster sauce contains actual chunks of deceased mobsters.",3,Big Bang Theory,148,23
12607,Raj,13," No, no, no, no, I think it just means it's the kind of sauce that mobsters like.",3,Big Bang Theory,81,17
12608,Howard,13, It doesn't mean any of that! It's a typo.,3,Big Bang Theory,42,9
12609,Leonard,13, You know what? Let's just get a pizza.,3,Big Bang Theory,39,8
12610,Sheldon,13, Good idea. We'll go to Corleone's.,3,Big Bang Theory,35,6
12611,Howard,13," Sure, no mobsters there.",3,Big Bang Theory,25,4
12613,Sheldon,13," You know, the more I think about it, the mobster sauce couldn't possibly contain chunks of mobster.",3,Big Bang Theory,100,17
12614,Leonard,13, And why is that?,3,Big Bang Theory,17,4
12615,Sheldon,13, It was listed under seafood.,3,Big Bang Theory,29,5
12616,Leonard,13, What if they were mobsters who slept with the fishes?,3,Big Bang Theory,54,10
12617,Sheldon,13," Leonard, are we having a serious conversation or not?",3,Big Bang Theory,54,9

12628,Sheldon,13," In anticipation of their arrival, I've bagged some evidence. One of the thieves had the audacity to quench his thirst while ransacking our home. You should be able to pull some good prints off this. And now, here are my prints so you can rule me out as a suspect.",3,Big Bang Theory,264,50
12629,Leonard,13, What about me?,3,Big Bang Theory,15,3
12630,Sheldon,13," I'm sorry, Leonard. It's too early to discount the possibility of this being an inside job.",3,Big Bang Theory,92,16
12631,Leonard,13, Would I be completely out of line to ask you to shoot him?,3,Big Bang Theory,59,13
12633,Sheldon,13, I'm not crazy. My mother had me tested.,3,Big Bang Theory,40,8
12635,Sheldon,13," I'm sorry, that's the end of your inquiry?",3,Big Bang Theory,43,8
12637,Sheldon,13," Oh, my goodness. Where do I begin? For instance, my laptop contained four out of the five gedanken experiments necessary for a cogent restatement of the quantum measurement problem.",3,Big Bang Theory,182,29
12638,Leonard,13, How is that going to help them?,3,Big Bang Theory,32,7
12639,Sheldon,13," Well, they could monitor scientific publications and see if anyone posts such a cogent restatement in the next couple of months. If so, the authors are most likely in possession of my stolen laptop.",3,Big Bang Theory,199,34
12641,Leonard,13, What are we supposed to do now?,3,Big Bang Theory,32,7
12642,Sheldon,13, The only thing we can do. Watch TV on our phones until the criminals return and bludgeon us to death in our sleep.,3,Big Bang Theory,115,23
12643,Leonard,13, Does that mean you've ruled me out as a suspect?,3,Big Bang Theory,49,10
12644,Sheldon,13," Oh, how I wish I could.",3,Big Bang Theory,24,6
12646,Sheldon,13, I do not have to urinate. I am the master of my own bladder. Drat.,3,Big Bang Theory,67,15
12648,Penny,13," I can't believe it. If I hadn't been working the dinner shift, I would've run",3,Big Bang Theory,78,15
12649,Leonard,13," Hey, there's no reason for you to be scared.",3,Big Bang Theory,45,9
12650,Penny,13, I'm not scared. I would've gone all Nebraska on their asses.,3,Big Bang Theory,61,11
12651,Sheldon,13,  Leonard and Penny.  Leonard and Penny.  Leonard and Penny.,3,Big Bang Theory,60,9
12652,Leonard,13, Hand me the bat.,3,Big Bang Theory,17,4
12653,Sheldon,13," We just had a major crime in the building, and you open the door without asking who it is?",3,Big Bang Theory,91,19
12654,Penny,13," It won't happen again, what's up?",3,Big Bang Theory,34,6
12655,Sheldon,13, Nothing. Just wanted to see if you were both okay.,3,Big Bang Theory,51,10
12656,Leonard,13," We're fine, Sheldon.",3,Big Bang Theory,21,3
12657,Sheldon,13," All right, then. Good night.",3,Big Bang Theory,29,5
12658,Penny,13," Good night. That was weird, even for him.",3,Big Bang Theory,42,8
12659,Leonard,13, Mm-hmm.,3,Big Bang Theory,8,1
12660,Sheldon,13,  Leonard and Penny.  Leonard and Penny.  Leonard and Penny.,3,Big Bang Theory,60,9
12661,Penny,13, Who is it?,3,Big Bang Theory,11,3
12662,Sheldon,13, Sheldon. Sheldon Cooper.,3,Big Bang Theory,25,3
12663,Penny,13, Yes?,3,Big Bang Theory,5,1
12664,Sheldon,13, May I come in?,3,Big Bang Theory,15,4
12665,Penny,13, Yeah.,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
12666,Sheldon,13, I see you're drinking wine.,3,Big Bang Theory,28,5
12667,Leonard,13," Yes, we are. And we're about to go to bed.",3,Big Bang Theory,43,10
12668,Sheldon,13, Uh-huh.,3,Big Bang Theory,8,1
12669,Penny,13," Sheldon, do you want to sleep here tonight?",3,Big Bang Theory,44,8
12670,Sheldon,13," Oh, as small as Leonard is, I don't think the two of you'd be comfortable on the couch.",3,Big Bang Theory,88,18
12671,Leonard,13, What do you want?,3,Big Bang Theory,18,4
12672,Sheldon,13," It's not what I want, it's what evolution wants. Human beings are primates. Primates have evolved to live in groups, both for protection and support.",3,Big Bang Theory,150,25
12673,Leonard,13, But you don't like other people.,3,Big Bang Theory,33,6
12674,Sheldon,13, I do tonight. It's scary over there.,3,Big Bang Theory,37,7
12675,Leonard,13," It's getting scary here, too.",3,Big Bang Theory,30,5
12677,Penny,13," Um three little kittens? Three little pigs? God, I don't know. Star Wars?",3,Big Bang Theory,74,13
12678,Leonard,13, Did we win? Can we go to bed?,3,Big Bang Theory,30,8
12679,Sheldon,13," Good Lord, I could not have made this easier. Hydrogen atom, H, plus pigs minus pea, Higgs. Bow, General Zod trapped in the Phantom Zone. Bow-zone. Pear. Tickle. Pear-tickle. Higgs Boson Particle. How could you not get that?",3,Big Bang Theory,225,38
12680,Leonard,13," He's right, Penny. It's all there.",3,Big Bang Theory,35,6
12681,Penny,13," Look, Sheldon, sweetie, I know you're feeling insecure, but we've really got to go to sleep.",3,Big Bang Theory,93,16
12682,Sheldon,13, All right. I'll take the first watch and wake you at 0400.,3,Big Bang Theory,59,12
12683,Leonard,13, Great. Good night.,3,Big Bang Theory,19,3
12684,Penny,13," Wait, wait, what's 0400?",3,Big Bang Theory,25,4
12685,Leonard,13, 4am.,3,Big Bang Theory,5,1
12686,Penny,13," That's, like, in 45 minutes.",3,Big Bang Theory,29,5
12687,Leonard,13, Just keep walking. ,3,Big Bang Theory,20,3

12697,Leonard,13, Who is it?,3,Big Bang Theory,11,3
12699,Howard,13," All right, we've got a titanium dead bolt and a reinforced jamb controlled by a state-of-the-art electronic access system.",3,Big Bang Theory,123,19
12700,Sheldon,13, What if they cut the power?,3,Big Bang Theory,28,6
12701,Raj,13, There's a 200-watt uninterruptible backup power supply.,3,Big Bang Theory,56,7
12702,Sheldon,13, What if someone steals my keys?,3,Big Bang Theory,32,6
12703,Raj,13, There are independent voice and fingerprint scanners.,3,Big Bang Theory,54,7
12704,Sheldon,13," What if someone kidnaps me, forces me to record my voice, and then cuts off my thumb?",3,Big Bang Theory,86,17
12705,Leonard,13, I'll send them a basket of muffins.,3,Big Bang Theory,36,7
12706,Howard,13," Now, inside, we've got motion detectors, infrared sensors, and cameras connected to a server running state-of-the-art facial recognition software.",3,Big Bang Theory,147,19
12707,Leonard,13, Where did you get all this stuff?,3,Big Bang Theory,34,7
12708,Howard,13, I got a buddy over at the Department of Defence.,3,Big Bang Theory,49,10
12709,Leonard,13, He just gave it to you?,3,Big Bang Theory,24,6
12710,Howard,13," I'm sure he would have if I had asked. Ironically, their security isn't all that good.",3,Big Bang Theory,87,16
12711,Penny,13," Raj, your car is blocking me  What the hell?",3,Big Bang Theory,45,9
12712,Leonard,13," Sorry, let me help you.",3,Big Bang Theory,24,5
12713,Sheldon,13, Wonderful security system if we're attacked by a school of tuna.,3,Big Bang Theory,65,11
12714,Howard,13," Don't worry, the net's going to be electrified. Picture her on the floor, spasming uncontrollably.",3,Big Bang Theory,99,15
12715,Sheldon,13, Better.,3,Big Bang Theory,8,1
12717,Sheldon,13," Sheldon's journal. Security system in place. However, sleep continues to elude me. I've seen the underbelly of Pasadena, this so-called City of Roses, and it haunts me. Ah, the injustice, I lie here awake, tormented, while out there evil lurks, probably playing Donkey Kong on my classic Nintendo.  Oh, dear. I am the master of my own bladder.  Leonard and Penny.  Leonard and Penny.  Leonard and Penny.",3,Big Bang Theory,404,67
12718,Penny,13," Oh, my",3,Big Bang Theory,7,2
12719,Leonard,13," God, Sheldon. What the hell are you doing out there?",3,Big Bang Theory,53,10
12720,Sheldon,13, I heard a noise.,3,Big Bang Theory,17,4
12721,Leonard,13, It was us. We knocked over a lamp.,3,Big Bang Theory,35,8
12722,Sheldon,13, Why would you knock over a lamp?,3,Big Bang Theory,33,7
12723,Leonard,13, We were going to have,3,Big Bang Theory,22,5
12724,Penny,13," He doesn't need to know what we were doing, Leonard.",3,Big Bang Theory,53,10
12725,Sheldon,13," Oh! No, she's right, I don't need to know what you were doing. Carry on. ",3,Big Bang Theory,74,15
12726,Leonard,13, What are you doing? Use the door.,3,Big Bang Theory,34,7
12727,Sheldon,13, Good thinking. Perhaps I'll check the perimeter and make some warm milk.,3,Big Bang Theory,73,12
12728,Leonard,13," Great, you do that.",3,Big Bang Theory,20,4
12729,Sheldon,13, Would you like me to bring you some warm milk?,3,Big Bang Theory,47,10
12730,Leonard,13, I'm lactose intolerant.,3,Big Bang Theory,24,3
12731,Sheldon,13," And you don't wish to alarm me with any more loud noises, very thoughtful. Warm milk, Penny?",3,Big Bang Theory,93,17
12732,Penny,13," No, thanks.",3,Big Bang Theory,12,2
12733,Sheldon,13," Fine. Good night to you, sir. Miss.",3,Big Bang Theory,36,7
12734,Leonard,13, Sorry about that.,3,Big Bang Theory,18,3
12735,Penny,13," Ugh, what can you do? Here. ",3,Big Bang Theory,29,6
12736,Leonard,13, Looks like Wolowitz got the net electrified.,3,Big Bang Theory,45,7
12737,Penny,13," Sheldon, are you okay?",3,Big Bang Theory,23,4
12738,Sheldon,13, I'm fine. Although I'm no longer the master of my own bladder.,3,Big Bang Theory,63,12
12740,Sheldon,13, My new computer came with Windows 7. Windows 7 is much more user-friendly than Windows Vista. I don't like that.,3,Big Bang Theory,113,20
12741,Leonard,13, Don't you think looking for a new city to live in is a bit of an overreaction?,3,Big Bang Theory,79,17
12742,Sheldon,13," Our apartment was broken into, our security system tried to kill me, and as a result, I'm leaving Pasadena forever. Tell me how that's overreacting.",3,Big Bang Theory,149,25
12743,Penny,13," Come on, Sheldon, you can't move. Don't you need to stay in one place so the mother ship can find you when it returns?",3,Big Bang Theory,119,24
12744,Sheldon,13," Oh, if that were only true. Unfortunately, as I'm earthbound for the foreseeable future, I need to find a location that's more hospitable than the mean streets of Pasadena. Like Enid, Oklahoma. Low crime rate and high-speed Internet connectivity, but no model train shops. Sorry, Enid.",3,Big Bang Theory,286,46
12745,Penny,13, Is he quitting his job at the university?,3,Big Bang Theory,42,8
12746,Leonard,13," Oh, no, he's going to telecommute. Everybody's really excited about it.",3,Big Bang Theory,72,11
12747,Sheldon,13," All right. Boone, North Carolina. Every summer since 1952, Boone has hosted an outdoor amphitheater portrayal of the life and times of its namesake, Dan'l Boone. Sounds like something that would attract the wrong crowd. Penny, you're from Nebraska, correct?",3,Big Bang Theory,258,40
12748,Penny,13, Born and raised. ,3,Big Bang Theory,18,3
12750,Sheldon,13," It will take me a few days to get settled. After I do, I will e-mail you detailed PDFs containing diagrams and instructions that will guide you through packing and shipping the rest of my possessions to Bozeman, Montana. In the meantime, please forward my mail.",3,Big Bang Theory,262,46
12751,Leonard,13," Any place specific or just the Bozeman, Montana Loony Bin?",3,Big Bang Theory,59,10
12752,Sheldon,13," I sense you're making a joke, but Bozeman does have a comedy club called The Loony Bin, so do not forward my mail there.",3,Big Bang Theory,121,24
12753,Howard,13," Oh, come on. So you were the victim of a crime. That's part of life. When my great-grandfather first came to this country, he put all his hopes and dreams into this little butcher shop he ran on the Lower East Side of New York. You know what happened? Every customer who walked into that butcher shop and asked for a pound of liver, got ripped off. But, those people moved on, and so should you.",3,Big Bang Theory,396,76
12754,Sheldon,13, I am moving on. I'm going to be a Bozite.,3,Big Bang Theory,42,10
12755,Leonard,13, They call themselves Bozites?,3,Big Bang Theory,30,4
12756,Sheldon,13, They should. It's one of the first things I plan to bring up upon arrival.,3,Big Bang Theory,75,15
12757,Penny,13," Sheldon, I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm going to miss you.",3,Big Bang Theory,69,13
12758,Sheldon,13," Please, Penny, as you know, I'm not comfortable with prolonged good-byes and maudlin displays of emotion, so I prepared a short video.",3,Big Bang Theory,135,22
12760,Penny,13," Sheldon, that's so ",3,Big Bang Theory,20,3
12761,Sheldon,13, You might want to lock the door behind me. This isn't Bozeman.,3,Big Bang Theory,63,12
12762,Howard,13, How the hell do I know who's the friend and who's the acquaintance?,3,Big Bang Theory,68,13
12764,Sheldon,13," That is a bracing cold, an invigorating cold. Lord, is it cold!",3,Big Bang Theory,64,12
12766,Sheldon,13," Thank you, fellow Bozite. And may I say, you are the living embodiment of all the promises made by our lovely town's Chamber of Commerce.  Wait! Wait! Excuse me!  One ticket to Pasadena, California, please.",3,Big Bang Theory,207,35
12768,Howard,13," Hey, look who's back!",3,Big Bang Theory,22,4
12769,Sheldon,13, Interesting. The acquaintance is the first to greet me.,3,Big Bang Theory,56,9
12771,Penny,14, Whatcha doing?,3,Big Bang Theory,15,2
12772,Sheldon,14, I'm attempting to view my work as a fleeting peripheral image so as to engage the superior colliculus of my brain.,3,Big Bang Theory,115,21
12773,Penny,14, Interesting. I usually just have coffee. You've been up all night?,3,Big Bang Theory,67,11
12774,Sheldon,14, Is it morning?,3,Big Bang Theory,15,3
12775,Penny,14, Yes.,3,Big Bang Theory,5,1
12776,Sheldon,14, Then I've been up all night.,3,Big Bang Theory,29,6
12777,Penny,14, And you're stuck?,3,Big Bang Theory,18,3
12778,Sheldon,14, Why else would a person try to engage their superior colliculus?,3,Big Bang Theory,65,11
12779,Penny,14," Oh, sorry, sweetie, I can't help you till I've had my coffee.",3,Big Bang Theory,62,12
12780,Leonard,14," Penny, I told you if you don't put him in his crate at night he just runs around the apartment.",3,Big Bang Theory,96,20
12781,Penny,14, What is he doing now?,3,Big Bang Theory,22,5
12782,Leonard,14," Mmm, he's either isolating the terms of his formula and examining them individually, or looking for the alligator that swallowed his hand after Peter Pan cut it off.",3,Big Bang Theory,166,28
12783,Sheldon,14," Captain Hook's hand was eaten by a crocodile, not an alligator. If you're going to mock me, at least get your facts straight.",3,Big Bang Theory,126,23
12784,Leonard,14," Aye, aye, Captain.",3,Big Bang Theory,19,3
12785,Sheldon,14, I can't see it! It just won't coalesce.,3,Big Bang Theory,40,8
12786,Leonard,14, Maybe you need a fresh start.,3,Big Bang Theory,30,6
12787,Sheldon,14," You're right.  It's a great idea, Leonard. Thank you.",3,Big Bang Theory,54,9
12789,Sheldon,14," Electrons move through graphene, act as if they have no mass",3,Big Bang Theory,61,11
12790,Howard,14, How long has he been stuck?,3,Big Bang Theory,28,6
12791,Leonard,14, Intellectually about 30 hours. Emotionally about 29 years.,3,Big Bang Theory,59,8
12792,Sheldon,14, Unit cell contains two carbon atoms. Interior angle of a hexagon is 120 degrees.,3,Big Bang Theory,81,14
12793,Howard,14, Have you tried rebooting him?,3,Big Bang Theory,30,5
12794,Leonard,14," No, I think it's a firmware problem.",3,Big Bang Theory,37,7
12795,Raj,14," Hey, it's Disco Night at the Moonlight Roller Rink in Glendale tonight. Who's up for getting down?",3,Big Bang Theory,99,17
12796,Howard,14," Oh, that's perfect. Bernadette's been hocking me to take her roller skating.",3,Big Bang Theory,77,12
12797,Leonard,14, I think Penny likes to skate. The four of us could double.,3,Big Bang Theory,59,12
12798,Howard,14, What could be better? We're in.,3,Big Bang Theory,32,6
12799,Raj,14, Great. It's not like I brought it up because I wanted to go.,3,Big Bang Theory,61,13
12800,Howard,14, You can come with us.,3,Big Bang Theory,22,5
12801,Raj,14," No, it's okay. I don't have to go. I'm happy just to guide you and your ladies to suitable entertainment choices. I'm a walking brown Yelp.com.",3,Big Bang Theory,144,26
12802,Sheldon,14," Structure, constant structure. One atom",3,Big Bang Theory,40,5
12803,Howard,14," Boy, he's really gone, isn't he?",3,Big Bang Theory,33,6
12804,Leonard,14," Yeah, this morning he used a stick of butter as deodorant.",3,Big Bang Theory,59,11
12805,Howard,14, I thought I smelled popcorn.,3,Big Bang Theory,29,5
12806,Sheldon,14," Pattern is the same as fermions, travels on the pathways, hexagonal, it's always hexagonal",3,Big Bang Theory,91,14
12807,Leonard,14, I haven't seen him this stuck since he tried to figure out the third Matrix movie.,3,Big Bang Theory,83,16
12808,Raj,14," Hey, those are my lima beans!",3,Big Bang Theory,30,6
12809,Sheldon,14," Not lima beans, carbon atoms.",3,Big Bang Theory,30,5
12810,Raj,14," But if I don't eat my lima beans, I can't have my cookie.",3,Big Bang Theory,58,13

12814,Sheldon,14, Don't be ridiculous. What would I do with corn?,3,Big Bang Theory,48,9
12815,Leonard,14," So roller skating, should we all grab a bite to eat first?",3,Big Bang Theory,59,12
12816,Howard,14, Good. P.F. Chang's? My mom has coupons.,3,Big Bang Theory,40,7
12817,Leonard,14," Great. Your mom's not coming, right?",3,Big Bang Theory,37,6
12818,Howard,14," Not this time, I promise.",3,Big Bang Theory,26,5
12819,Raj,14," Okay, just to be clear, roller skating was my idea, and I'm very unhappy that you turned it into a double date, and I hope you both fall on your asses and break your coccyxes.",3,Big Bang Theory,176,35
12820,Sheldon,14, The plural of coccyx is coccyges.,3,Big Bang Theory,34,6
12821,Raj,14, Screw you. Give me back my lima beans.,3,Big Bang Theory,39,8
12824,Penny,14, Not recently.,3,Big Bang Theory,14,2
12826,Penny,14," For me, the worst part was when people saw us leave with them.",3,Big Bang Theory,63,13

12871,Penny,14, Okay. Have fun.,3,Big Bang Theory,16,3
12873,Leonard,14, Hi. I'm Dr. Hofstadter. Where is he?,3,Big Bang Theory,37,7
12875,Leonard,14, Thanks for not calling the cops.,3,Big Bang Theory,33,6
12877,Leonard,14," Yeah, well, he's extra special. Hey, Shelly. What you doing?",3,Big Bang Theory,61,10
12878,Sheldon,14, Size ratio was all wrong. Couldn't visualize it. Needed bigger carbon atoms.,3,Big Bang Theory,77,12
12879,Leonard,14," Sure, sure. How did you get into this place?",3,Big Bang Theory,45,9
12880,Sheldon,14," Back door has a five-pin tumbler system, single-circuit alarm. Child's play. You can start sorting protons and neutrons while I build carbon atoms.",3,Big Bang Theory,148,23
12881,Leonard,14," No, I don't think so. We need to go home now.",3,Big Bang Theory,46,11
12882,Sheldon,14, But I'm still working.,3,Big Bang Theory,23,4
12883,Leonard,14," If you don't come out of there, I'm going to have to drag you out.",3,Big Bang Theory,67,15
12884,Sheldon,14," You can try, but you'll never catch me. ",3,Big Bang Theory,41,8
12885,Leonard,14," For God's sakes. Sheldon, come here!",3,Big Bang Theory,37,6
12886,Sheldon,14, Bazinga.  Bazinga.  Bazinga.  Bazinga.  Bazinga.,3,Big Bang Theory,49,5
12888,Sheldon,14,  Leonard and Penny.  Leonard and Penny.,3,Big Bang Theory,40,6
12889,Leonard,14," What! What, what, what?",3,Big Bang Theory,24,4
12890,Sheldon,14,  Leonard and Penny.,3,Big Bang Theory,20,3
12891,Leonard,14, What?,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
12892,Sheldon,14, I have good news.,3,Big Bang Theory,18,4
12893,Leonard,14, And you had to barge in here and wake us up in the middle of the night?,3,Big Bang Theory,72,17
12894,Sheldon,14, Your cell phone was off.,3,Big Bang Theory,25,5
12895,Leonard,14, Because we didn't want to be disturbed.,3,Big Bang Theory,40,7
12896,Sheldon,14," And that didn't work out, did it?",3,Big Bang Theory,34,7
12897,Penny,14," Sheldon, what do you want?",3,Big Bang Theory,27,5
12898,Sheldon,14, I came to tell you I've got the answer.,3,Big Bang Theory,40,9
12899,Leonard,14, Really? You figured out the graphene problem?,3,Big Bang Theory,46,7
12900,Sheldon,14," No, no, I'm still hopelessly stuck on that, but I figured out how to figure it out.",3,Big Bang Theory,84,17
12901,Penny,14," Hey, you know what, Leonard, I know I said I could handle your roommate, but I was wrong. We're going to have to break up.",3,Big Bang Theory,123,25
12902,Leonard,14, What are you talking about?,3,Big Bang Theory,28,5
12903,Penny,14, Oh.,3,Big Bang Theory,4,1
12904,Sheldon,14, Einstein.,3,Big Bang Theory,10,1
12905,Leonard,14," Yeah, I'm going to need a little more.",3,Big Bang Theory,39,8
12906,Sheldon,14, Albert Einstein.,3,Big Bang Theory,17,2
12907,Leonard,14, Keep going.,3,Big Bang Theory,12,2
12908,Sheldon,14," When Albert Einstein came up with special relativity, he was working at the patent office.",3,Big Bang Theory,91,15
12909,Leonard,14," So, you're going to go work at the patent office?",3,Big Bang Theory,50,10
12910,Sheldon,14," Don't be absurd. That's in Washington. You know I could never live in a city whose streets are laid out in a wheel-and-spoke pattern. No. I'm going to find a similarly menial job where my basal ganglia are occupied with a routine task, freeing my prefrontal cortex to work quietly in the background on my problem.",3,Big Bang Theory,314,56
12911,Leonard,14, Sounds like a great plan.,3,Big Bang Theory,26,5
12912,Sheldon,14, Of course it is. Even talking to you is sufficiently menial that I can feel the proverbial juices starting to flow.,3,Big Bang Theory,116,21
12913,Leonard,14," Okay, well, thanks for sharing with us. Good night.",3,Big Bang Theory,52,9
12914,Sheldon,14," You're welcome. Good night to you, too. Oh, by the way, I was watching you sleep for a moment, and I noticed that your snoring seems to be worse when you're on your back.",3,Big Bang Theory,171,34
12915,Penny,14, Leonard doesn't snore.,3,Big Bang Theory,23,3
12916,Sheldon,14," No, I wasn't talking to Leonard.",3,Big Bang Theory,33,6
12917,Leonard,14, Told you.,3,Big Bang Theory,10,2
12920,Sheldon,14, A menial job. Like yours.,3,Big Bang Theory,26,5
12922,Sheldon,14," I do. For thousands of years, the lowest classes of the human race have spent their lives labouring to erect monuments under the lash of their betters, until finally they dropped down and became one with the dust through which they trudged. Do you have anything like that?",3,Big Bang Theory,273,48
12924,Sheldon,14, Shouldn't you check your database?,3,Big Bang Theory,35,5
12926,Sheldon,14, You didn't really type.,3,Big Bang Theory,24,4
12928,Sheldon,14," Oh, that would be good! Sawing, hammering, eating out of a lunch pail as my working-class fellows and I sit perched precariously on a girder high above the metropolis.",3,Big Bang Theory,168,29
12930,Sheldon,14, I could do that.,3,Big Bang Theory,17,4
12932,Sheldon,14, One question.,3,Big Bang Theory,14,2
12934,Sheldon,14, What's sheetrock?,3,Big Bang Theory,18,2
12936,Sheldon,14, That seems acceptable.,3,Big Bang Theory,23,3
12938,Sheldon,14, I don't drive.,3,Big Bang Theory,15,3
12940,Sheldon,14," Senior theoretical particle physicist at CalTech, focusing on M theory, or, in layman's terms, string theory.",3,Big Bang Theory,110,16
12943,Penny,14," Okay, I'll get those drinks started for you.",3,Big Bang Theory,45,8
12944,Sheldon,14, Behind you.,3,Big Bang Theory,12,2
12945,Penny,14," Sheldon, what the hell are you doing?",3,Big Bang Theory,38,7
12946,Sheldon,14, I'm trying to get these tables cleared. We're slammed.,3,Big Bang Theory,55,9
12947,Penny,14," No, wait, wait, no, wait. Wh.. what are you doing here?",3,Big Bang Theory,56,11
12948,Sheldon,14," A reasonable question. I asked myself, what is the most mind-numbing, pedestrian job conceivable, and three answers came to mind, uh, toll booth attendant, an Apple Store genius, and what Penny does. Now, since I don't like touching other people's coins, and I refuse to contribute to the devaluation of the word genius, here I am.",3,Big Bang Theory,332,56
12949,Penny,14," You just, you just walked in and they hired you, just like that?",3,Big Bang Theory,65,13
12950,Sheldon,14," Oh, heavens, no. Since I don't need to be paid, I didn't need to be hired. I simply came in, picked up a tray, and started working for the man. Let me get that plate out of your way.",3,Big Bang Theory,183,39
12951,Penny,14," Sheldon, this is ridiculous.",3,Big Bang Theory,29,4
12952,Sheldon,14," Is it? Just a moment ago I had a minor epiphany regarding the polymer degradation phenomenon while scraping congealed nachos off a plate. Bernadette, table 10 wants their check.",3,Big Bang Theory,178,29
12954,Penny,14," Sheldon, wait, this isn't even what I do. I'm a waitress, not a busboy.",3,Big Bang Theory,72,14
12955,Sheldon,14," You're right. That is more menial. Hello, I'm Sheldon. I'll be your server today. I don't recommend the salmon. I saw it in the kitchen.",3,Big Bang Theory,137,25
12957,Sheldon,14," All right, one bacon cheeseburger, breaking two Jewish dietary restrictions simultaneously, kudos. Beer-battered fish and chips. Now, here's your tartar sauce. I also brought you salsa. It's a little unconventional, but I think you'll like it. It's zingy. And for you, Factory Burrito Grande, no cheese, no sour cream, no ugly consequences from your lactose intolerance. Bon appÃ©tit.",3,Big Bang Theory,385,58
12958,Leonard,14," Hang on. Black beans, not pinto beans?",3,Big Bang Theory,39,7
12959,Sheldon,14, Yes.,3,Big Bang Theory,5,1
12960,Leonard,14, Double guacamole?,3,Big Bang Theory,18,2
12961,Sheldon,14, Of course.,3,Big Bang Theory,11,2
12962,Leonard,14, No cilantro?,3,Big Bang Theory,13,2
12963,Sheldon,14, Nope.,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
12964,Leonard,14," Lettuce shredded, not chopped?",3,Big Bang Theory,31,4
12965,Sheldon,14, Yep.,3,Big Bang Theory,5,1
12966,Leonard,14, You understand why I'm doing this to you?,3,Big Bang Theory,42,8
12967,Sheldon,14, I do.,3,Big Bang Theory,6,2
12968,Leonard,14, That'll be all. That was fun.,3,Big Bang Theory,30,6
12969,Raj,14, How long can he keep this up?,3,Big Bang Theory,30,7
12970,Leonard,14," I heard about this professor at MIT who melted down, bought a van, and spent the rest of his life as a mobile dog groomer.",3,Big Bang Theory,123,25
12971,Raj,14, He never went back to the university?,3,Big Bang Theory,38,7
12972,Leonard,14, Only to shampoo Professor Chambourg's shih tzu.,3,Big Bang Theory,48,7
12973,Raj,14, Sheesh.,3,Big Bang Theory,8,1
12974,Howard,14," I bet if we all chipped in, we could buy Sheldon a van.",3,Big Bang Theory,56,13
12975,Raj,14, But he's afraid of dogs.,3,Big Bang Theory,25,5
12976,Leonard,14," Yeah, that's the only thing wrong with that plan.",3,Big Bang Theory,50,9
12977,Penny,14," Hey, guys, sorry you had to wait, but we are swamped. What's this?",3,Big Bang Theory,67,13
12978,Leonard,14, Sheldon took our order.,3,Big Bang Theory,24,4
12979,Penny,14, Sheldon doesn't work here.,3,Big Bang Theory,27,4
12980,Leonard,14," Well, honey, not to complain, but we were starting to think you didn't either.",3,Big Bang Theory,79,14
12981,Sheldon,14, Is that really necessary? Good Lord. The interference pattern in the fracture. The motion of the wave through the molecular structure. I've been looking at it all wrong. I can't consider the electrons as particles. They move through the graphene as a wave. It's a wave! The moment to applaud would be now. Troglodytes.,3,Big Bang Theory,319,54
12982,Penny,14," Sheldon, where are you going? Aren't you going to clean this up?",3,Big Bang Theory,65,12
12983,Sheldon,14, I'm sorry. I don't work here.,3,Big Bang Theory,30,6
12985,Howard,14, Happy now?,3,Big Bang Theory,11,2
12986,Raj,14, I'm on a cloud. Swing me. ,3,Big Bang Theory,27,6
12988,Leonard,14," Sheldon, come here.",3,Big Bang Theory,20,3
12990,Howard,15," Yeah, I miss you, too, sweetie. Listen, I got to go, but I'll see you tonight? Okay. Bye-bye. Yeah, bye-bye. No, you hang up first. Hello?",3,Big Bang Theory,139,26
12991,Raj,15," Dude, I'm glad you finally got a girlfriend, but do you have to do all that lovey-dovey stuff in front of those of us who don't?",3,Big Bang Theory,129,26
12992,Sheldon,15," Actually, he might have to. There's an economic concept known as a positional good in which an object is only valued by the possessor because it's not possessed by others. The term was coined in 1976 by economist Fred Hirsch to replace the more colloquial, but less precise neener-neener.",3,Big Bang Theory,289,49
12993,Howard,15, That's not true. My happiness is not dependent on my best friend being miserable and alone.,3,Big Bang Theory,92,16
12994,Raj,15, Thank you.,3,Big Bang Theory,11,2
12995,Howard,15," Although, I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a little bit of a perk.",3,Big Bang Theory,67,15
12996,Leonard,15, Who's miserable and alone?,3,Big Bang Theory,27,4
12997,Raj,15, Me.,3,Big Bang Theory,4,1
12998,Leonard,15, Oh. I used to be like that. Then I got a girlfriend.,3,Big Bang Theory,53,12
12999,Sheldon,15," In pre-1976 terms, neener-neener.",3,Big Bang Theory,34,4
13000,Leonard,15," Hey, what are you and Bernadette doing for your first Valentine's Day?",3,Big Bang Theory,71,12
13001,Howard,15," Yeah, I am pulling out all the stops. There's a $39.95 lover's special at P.F. Chang's. Egg rolls, dumplings, bottomless wok, and you get your picture taken on the big marble horse out front.",3,Big Bang Theory,192,34
13002,Sheldon,15," Given that Saint Valentine was a third century Roman priest who was stoned and beheaded, wouldn't a more appropriate celebration of the evening be taking one's steady gal to witness a brutal murder?",3,Big Bang Theory,199,33
13003,Howard,15," I understand your point, but given a choice, Jews always go with Chinese food.",3,Big Bang Theory,79,14
13004,Raj,15," Well, if anyone's interested, I'll be spending this Valentine's Day the same way I spend every Valentine's Day. Buying a rotisserie chicken from the supermarket, taking it home, standing over the sink and eating it out of the package with my bare hands like an animal.",3,Big Bang Theory,269,46
13005,Raj,15," Fine, tell us you're going to have sex with Penny.",3,Big Bang Theory,51,10
13006,Leonard,15, That's not what I was going to tell you.,3,Big Bang Theory,41,9
13007,Raj,15, It's okay. I don't mind hearing about your sex life. It's his that bugs me.,3,Big Bang Theory,76,15
13008,Leonard,15, Guess who the university is sending to Switzerland to attend a conference and see the CERN supercollider on February 14?,3,Big Bang Theory,121,20
13009,Sheldon,15," Professor Norton, although, God knows why. He hasn't published anything of note since he won that Nobel Prize.",3,Big Bang Theory,111,18
13010,Leonard,15," Actually, Professor Norton can't make it. He threw his back out rock climbing.",3,Big Bang Theory,79,13
13011,Howard,15, I heard he threw his back out climbing on his new girlfriend.,3,Big Bang Theory,62,12
13012,Raj,15, The big-boobed weather girl on Channel 2?,3,Big Bang Theory,42,7
13013,Howard,15, That's the one.,3,Big Bang Theory,16,3
13014,Leonard,15," In any case, they're asking me to fill in for him.",3,Big Bang Theory,51,11
13015,Sheldon,15, In Switzerland or with the big-boobed weather girl?,3,Big Bang Theory,52,8
13016,Leonard,15, Switzerland. And I get to bring a guest!,3,Big Bang Theory,41,8
13017,Howard,15," Oh, man!",3,Big Bang Theory,9,2
13018,Raj,15," No way, dude!",3,Big Bang Theory,14,3
13019,Sheldon,15," This is incredible! I'm so happy, I'm not even going to question their judgment in picking you. I'm just going to run home and start packing.",3,Big Bang Theory,142,26
13020,Raj,15, Why wouldn't you take Penny?,3,Big Bang Theory,29,5
13021,Leonard,15, I am taking Penny.,3,Big Bang Theory,19,4
13022,Raj,15," Oh. Well, then I anticipate an awkward situation when you get home.",3,Big Bang Theory,68,12
13024,Leonard,15," Sheldon, you got a minute?",3,Big Bang Theory,27,5
13025,Sheldon,15," Of course, my good friend. Come in. Help me out, which ski hat says aprÃ¨s supercollider?",3,Big Bang Theory,90,16
13026,Leonard,15," Sheldon, I'm not taking you to Switzerland.",3,Big Bang Theory,44,7
13027,Sheldon,15," Well, of course you are. Who else would you take?",3,Big Bang Theory,50,10
13028,Leonard,15, Penny.,3,Big Bang Theory,7,1
13029,Sheldon,15, What? That's absurd. Penny has no interest in subatomic particle research.,3,Big Bang Theory,75,11
13030,Leonard,15," Yes, but it'll be Valentine's Day. We can go sightseeing and skiing and make love in front of a roaring fire in the shadow of the snowcapped Alps.",3,Big Bang Theory,147,28
13031,Sheldon,15, But Penny has no interest in subatomic particle research.,3,Big Bang Theory,58,9
13032,Leonard,15," I'm sorry, Sheldon.",3,Big Bang Theory,20,3
13033,Sheldon,15, Sorry? I've been dreaming about going to the Large Hadron Collider since I was nine years old.,3,Big Bang Theory,95,17
13034,Leonard,15," Yeah, well, I've been dreaming about spending Valentine's Day with a girl since I was six.",3,Big Bang Theory,91,16
13035,Sheldon,15, Shame on you! That's no dream for a scientist!,3,Big Bang Theory,47,9
13037,Penny,15," Okay, what's the big surprise?",3,Big Bang Theory,31,5
13038,Leonard,15, Just a minute. This tray contains clues as to what you and I are going to be doing on Valentine's Day.,3,Big Bang Theory,103,21
13039,Penny,15," Oh. Wow. Okay. Let's see. We've got, uh, milk chocolate, Swiss cheese, fondue. My lactose-intolerant boyfriend is going to eat all this, then I'm going to climb on his back and rocket to the moon?",3,Big Bang Theory,197,35
13040,Leonard,15," No. But it does involve air travel. Okay, um, let me slice this Swiss cheese with my Swiss army knife, and then you can wash it down with a cup of Swiss Miss instant cocoa.",3,Big Bang Theory,173,35
13041,Penny,15," Okay, I'm starting to think Swiss is key here.",3,Big Bang Theory,47,9
13042,Leonard,15, Uh-huh.,3,Big Bang Theory,8,1
13043,Penny,15, We're going to Disneyland and ride the Matterhorn?,3,Big Bang Theory,51,8
13044,Leonard,15, How does that involve air travel?,3,Big Bang Theory,34,6
13045,Penny,15, We're going to Disney World and ride the Matterhorn?,3,Big Bang Theory,53,9
13046,Leonard,15, No.,3,Big Bang Theory,4,1
13047,Penny,15," Okay, sweetie, this started out fun, but I'm over it.",3,Big Bang Theory,54,10
13048,Leonard,15, We're going to Switzerland to see the CERN supercollider! And ski. We'll also go skiing.,3,Big Bang Theory,89,15
13049,Penny,15, We're going skiing in Switzerland?!,3,Big Bang Theory,36,5
13050,Leonard,15," Well, you'll ski, I'll fall, but, yeah, we will be in Switzerland for Valentine's Day.",3,Big Bang Theory,87,15
13051,Penny,15," Oh, my God, Leonard! That's incredible!",3,Big Bang Theory,40,6
13052,Sheldon,15," Not so fast. You might want to hold off on lighting your rabeliechtli, Penny.",3,Big Bang Theory,78,14
13053,Penny,15, My Rabe-what-ly?,3,Big Bang Theory,17,2
13054,Sheldon,15," Rabeliechtli. It means turnip light and refers to a traditional lantern hand-carved from a root vegetable and used to celebrate certain Swiss festivals. Which you will not be celebrating because, A, these festivals occur in the fall, and B, you will not be going to Switzerland.",3,Big Bang Theory,279,46
13055,Leonard,15," Sheldon, we've been through this. I'm taking Penny.",3,Big Bang Theory,52,8
13056,Sheldon,15, Afraid not. Do you recognize this?,3,Big Bang Theory,35,6
13057,Leonard,15, Not the roommate agreement.,3,Big Bang Theory,28,4
13058,Sheldon,15," Indeed, the roommate agreement. I call your attention to the Friendship Rider in Appendix C, Future Commitments. Number 37, in the event one friend is ever invited to visit the Large Hadron Collider, now under construction in Switzerland, he shall invite the other friend to accompany him.",3,Big Bang Theory,290,47
13059,Leonard,15," Oh, for God's sakes.",3,Big Bang Theory,21,4
13060,Penny,15, You actually put that in an agreement?,3,Big Bang Theory,39,7
13061,Leonard,15," Yeah. We also put in what happens if one of us wins a MacArthur Grant, or if one of us gets superpowers, or if one of us is bitten by a zombie.",3,Big Bang Theory,144,32
13062,Sheldon,15," He can't kill me, even if I turn.",3,Big Bang Theory,34,8
13063,Penny,15, Is there anything in there about if one of you gets a girlfriend?,3,Big Bang Theory,66,13
13064,Sheldon,15," No, that seemed a little farfetched.",3,Big Bang Theory,37,6
13065,Leonard,15," Sheldon, do you really expect to enforce this?",3,Big Bang Theory,47,8
13066,Sheldon,15," I've lived up to all my commitments under the agreement. At least once a day I ask how you are, even though I simply don't care. I no longer stage spontaneous biohazard drills after 10 pm And I abandoned my goal to master Tuvan throat singing.",3,Big Bang Theory,244,46
13067,Penny,15," Okay, I know I shouldn't ask, but what is?",3,Big Bang Theory,43,9
13068,Leonard,15, No.,3,Big Bang Theory,4,1
13069,Sheldon,15, I'd be much further along if I'd been allowed to practice.,3,Big Bang Theory,59,11
13070,Leonard,15," Look, Sheldon, I know it's in the agreement, and if you turn into a zombie, I promise I will not kill you. In fact, I'll even let you eat my brains. But I am taking Penny to Switzerland.",3,Big Bang Theory,187,38
13071,Sheldon,15, Is that your final decision?,3,Big Bang Theory,29,5
13072,Leonard,15, It is.,3,Big Bang Theory,7,2
13073,Sheldon,15, Very well.,3,Big Bang Theory,11,2
13074,Penny,15," It's not over, is it?",3,Big Bang Theory,22,5
13075,Leonard,15, What do you think? ,3,Big Bang Theory,20,4
13077,Leonard,15," Got a bit of traffic this morning, huh? Think it's gonna rain? Instead of underpants, I covered my crotch with potato salad this morning. Thoughts? Okay, I know what'll cheer you up, let's play one of your driving games.",3,Big Bang Theory,221,39
13078,Sheldon,15," All right. This game is called Traitors. I will name three historical figures, you put them in order of the heinousness of their betrayal. Benedict Arnold, Judas, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.",3,Big Bang Theory,187,30
13079,Leonard,15, You really think I belong with Benedict Arnold and Judas?,3,Big Bang Theory,58,10
13080,Sheldon,15, You're right. Judas had the decency to hang himself after what he did.,3,Big Bang Theory,71,13
13081,Leonard,15," Come on, Sheldon. Can't you at least try to understand how much this means to me?",3,Big Bang Theory,82,16
13082,Sheldon,15," Round two, Leonard Hofstadter, Darth Vader, Rupert Murdoch.",3,Big Bang Theory,60,8
13083,Leonard,15, Rupert Murdoch?,3,Big Bang Theory,16,2
13084,Sheldon,15," He owns Fox, and they cancelled Firefly. Hint, he and Darth Vader are tied for number 2.",3,Big Bang Theory,89,17
13086,Howard,15, I'm sorry I couldn't hang with you last night. I had a date with Bernadette.,3,Big Bang Theory,77,15
13087,Raj,15, I know. I saw the Tweet.,3,Big Bang Theory,25,6
13088,Howard,15," So, what did you end up doing?",3,Big Bang Theory,31,7
13089,Raj,15, Not much. Nuked a burrito. Prayed to the Hindu god Urvashi that your bowels would loosen and your penis would droop like a willow tree.,3,Big Bang Theory,136,25
13090,Leonard,15, You seen Sheldon?,3,Big Bang Theory,18,3
13091,Raj,15, No. Is he still mad about the supercollider?,3,Big Bang Theory,45,8
13092,Leonard,15," Yeah. He thinks I betrayed him. I mean, come on, what would you guys do if you were me?",3,Big Bang Theory,88,19
13093,Howard,15, I'd take Sheldon to Switzerland.,3,Big Bang Theory,33,5
13094,Leonard,15, Seriously?,3,Big Bang Theory,11,1
13095,Howard,15, Absolutely. And I'd leave him there. ,3,Big Bang Theory,38,6
13096,Raj,15, What the hell is that?,3,Big Bang Theory,23,5
13097,Leonard,15," Uh, let's see. Yup, 30 pieces of silverware.",3,Big Bang Theory,45,8
13099,Sheldon,15," Morning, old chum.",3,Big Bang Theory,19,3
13100,Leonard,15, What's going on?,3,Big Bang Theory,17,3
13101,Sheldon,15," I've made you breakfast. Juice, coffee, and pancakes in the shape of some of your favorite fictional characters. See, here's Frodo.",3,Big Bang Theory,132,21
13102,Leonard,15, You made Frodo pancakes?,3,Big Bang Theory,25,4
13103,Sheldon,15," Yeah, I used coconut shavings to do the hair on his feet. If you need to void your bladder before eating, I can keep them warm with this beret that I thoroughly laundered and pressed into service as a pancake cosy.",3,Big Bang Theory,215,41
13104,Leonard,15, Why are you doing this?,3,Big Bang Theory,24,5
13105,Sheldon,15, It's by way of an apology for my recent behaviour. I've had some time to reflect and I've come to realize that friendship is not an aggregation of written agreements. It's a result of two people respecting and caring for each other. Butterscotch scone?,3,Big Bang Theory,253,44
13106,Leonard,15, Thanks. It's good.,3,Big Bang Theory,19,3
13107,Sheldon,15," What you're tasting is respect and affection. And about a pound of Crisco. After you've finished breakfast, I thought we could spend the day watching the final season of Babylon 5 with director commentary.",3,Big Bang Theory,206,34
13108,Leonard,15, You hate Babylon 5.,3,Big Bang Theory,20,4
13109,Sheldon,15," I do. It fails as drama, science fiction, and it's hopelessly derivative. But you like it, and you're my friend.",3,Big Bang Theory,113,20
13110,Leonard,15," Okay, great. Still not taking you to Switzerland.",3,Big Bang Theory,50,8
13111,Sheldon,15, Drat. No Frodo for you.,3,Big Bang Theory,24,5
13113,Sheldon,15, Hello.,3,Big Bang Theory,7,1
13114,Penny,15, Hello.,3,Big Bang Theory,7,1
13115,Sheldon,15," Alright, let's dispense with the friendly banter, I believe you know why I'm here.",3,Big Bang Theory,83,14
13116,Penny,15," Well, I always figured it was to study us, discover our weaknesses, and report back to your alien overlords.",3,Big Bang Theory,109,19
13117,Sheldon,15," Yes, amusing. Extraordinary intelligence might well appear extraterrestrial to you, but let me be more specific. I believe you know why I'm here in the laundry room.",3,Big Bang Theory,166,27
13118,Penny,15, Better acoustics for your throat singing?,3,Big Bang Theory,42,6
13119,Sheldon,15," It's actually not bad. But my true purpose in being here will be revealed in this brief PowerPoint presentation. Lights. Why Sheldon Cooper, PhD, should go to Switzerland to see the CERN supercollider. A PowerPoint presentation by Sheldon Cooper, PhD.",3,Big Bang Theory,252,40
13120,Penny,15," Oh, for God's sakes.",3,Big Bang Theory,21,4
13121,Sheldon,15, Here we have a highly gifted researcher in the field of particle physics whose work has brought him to the precipice of forever changing mankind's understanding of the universe. AKA me. And here we have a waitress brushing her teeth with her finger. AKA you.,3,Big Bang Theory,259,45
13122,Penny,15, I'm sorry. Is this supposed to be buttering me up?,3,Big Bang Theory,51,10
13123,Sheldon,15," Please hold all questions to the end of the presentation. This is the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Switzerland, the product of decades of planning and construction. It is a Mecca for physicists the world over. This is Bath and Body Works on Colorado Boulevard. They sell scented soaps and lotions, some of which contain glitter. Now, let's see if we can match the individual to the appropriate destination.",3,Big Bang Theory,411,70
13124,Penny,15," Okay, show's over.",3,Big Bang Theory,19,3
13125,Sheldon,15," No, it's not. I've got five more slides.",3,Big Bang Theory,41,8
13126,Penny,15," Sheldon, this is Leonard's decision. He invited me to Switzerland, and I intend to go.",3,Big Bang Theory,87,15
13127,Sheldon,15, Very well. Enjoy yourself. You're going to be in the presence of something that I've dreamed of seeing for decades. I just hope you'll be able to appreciate the magnitude of where you are and what it represents.,3,Big Bang Theory,212,38
13128,Penny,15, I'll talk to Leonard.,3,Big Bang Theory,22,4
13129,Sheldon,15, You will?,3,Big Bang Theory,10,2
13130,Penny,15," Yes. If it means that much to you, you should go.",3,Big Bang Theory,50,11
13131,Sheldon,15," Oh, Penny, thank you!",3,Big Bang Theory,22,4
13132,Penny,15, You're welcome.,3,Big Bang Theory,16,2
13133,Sheldon,15," Since I rarely hug, I'm relying on your expertise regarding duration.",3,Big Bang Theory,70,11
13134,Penny,15, I think we're there.,3,Big Bang Theory,21,4
13135,Sheldon,15," Oh, good. Bye-bye.",3,Big Bang Theory,19,3
13137,Raj,15," You know what? Even though I don't have a girlfriend, I can still have a good time on Valentine's Day.",3,Big Bang Theory,103,20
13138,Howard,15," Trust me, you can't. I've tried.",3,Big Bang Theory,33,6
13139,Raj,15," No, no, no, I'm going to have a me day. First I'm going to go to one of those spas in Koreatown, take a steam and get a massage. Then I'm going to stop at a pet store and get licked by puppies.",3,Big Bang Theory,194,43
13140,Leonard,15," Sheldon, I need to talk to you.",3,Big Bang Theory,32,7
13141,Sheldon,15," All right, my friend. Would you like some cholermus?",3,Big Bang Theory,53,9
13142,Leonard,15, Some what?,3,Big Bang Theory,11,2
13143,Sheldon,15, Cholermus. It's a traditional Swiss breakfast dish. I'm preparing my gastrointestinal system for the exotic cuisine of Switzerland.,3,Big Bang Theory,132,18
13144,Leonard,15, You're not going to Switzerland!,3,Big Bang Theory,33,5
13145,Sheldon,15," Oh, but I am. Didn't Penny tell you the good news?",3,Big Bang Theory,51,11
13146,Leonard,15, She told me that you went behind my back to guilt her into letting you go instead of her.,3,Big Bang Theory,90,19
13147,Sheldon,15," Yes, that good news.",3,Big Bang Theory,21,4
13148,Leonard,15," Well, forget it. I was the one who was invited, I get to decide who goes with me, and it's Penny, not you!",3,Big Bang Theory,107,23
13149,Sheldon,15," Howard, could you lower the lights? I have a short PowerPoint presentation.",3,Big Bang Theory,76,12
13150,Leonard,15, I don't need to see your presentation. This discussion is over!,3,Big Bang Theory,64,11
13151,Sheldon,15, That's a somewhat ambiguous response. Am I going or not?,3,Big Bang Theory,57,10
13152,Leonard,15," Sheldon, at this point, I would go by myself before I would take you.",3,Big Bang Theory,70,14
13153,Sheldon,15, Really?,3,Big Bang Theory,8,1
13154,Leonard,15," Yeah, really.",3,Big Bang Theory,14,2
13155,Sheldon,15," Well then, you leave me no alternative. From this moment forward, we can be roommates, but we will no longer be friends.",3,Big Bang Theory,121,22
13156,Leonard,15, I'm sorry you feel that way.,3,Big Bang Theory,29,6
13157,Sheldon,15," I don't think you're fully aware of the ramifications here, Leonard.",3,Big Bang Theory,69,11
13158,Leonard,15, Why don't you enlighten me?,3,Big Bang Theory,28,5
13159,Sheldon,15, With the friendship clause of our roommate agreement nullified you are no longer entitled to accompany me to go swimming at Bill Gates' house should I be invited.,3,Big Bang Theory,163,28
13160,Howard,15," Ooh, that's gotta sting.",3,Big Bang Theory,25,4
13162,Leonard,15," Just think, this time tomorrow we'll be in Geneva, Switzerland for our first Valentine's Day.",3,Big Bang Theory,94,15
13163,Penny,15, I know! I went shopping today and bought special undies for the occasion.,3,Big Bang Theory,74,13
13164,Leonard,15, Thermal? â€˜Cause it's gonna be cold.,3,Big Bang Theory,38,6
13165,Penny,15," Think it through, Leonard.",3,Big Bang Theory,27,4
13166,Leonard,15, Oh!,3,Big Bang Theory,4,1
13167,Penny,15, Oh!,3,Big Bang Theory,4,1
13168,Leonard,15," Gesundheit. Or as they say in Switzerland, gesundheit. You getting a cold?",3,Big Bang Theory,75,12
13169,Penny,15," No, no, it's probably just allergies.",3,Big Bang Theory,38,6
13170,Leonard,15," Do you want an allergy pill? â€˜Cause I have 'em all. Prescription, nonprescription, foreign, domestic, experimental.",3,Big Bang Theory,118,16
13171,Penny,15, Do any of them work?,3,Big Bang Theory,21,5
13172,Leonard,15," Not really, I'm just an enthusiast.",3,Big Bang Theory,36,6
13173,Leonard,15, Penny? You okay?,3,Big Bang Theory,17,3
13174,Penny,15, Did that sound okay to you? Do not come in here!,3,Big Bang Theory,49,11
13175,Leonard,15, What's going on?,3,Big Bang Theory,17,3
13176,Penny,15, I'm having a tea party. What do you think's going on? I think I might have the flu. Or the plague.,3,Big Bang Theory,99,21
13177,Leonard,15," Well, our plane leaves at 9 a.m. Do you think you'll feel better by then?",3,Big Bang Theory,74,15
13178,Penny,15, Yep. â€˜Cause I'm gonna be dead.,3,Big Bang Theory,33,6
13180,Leonard,15," Hey, Sheldon? Listen, Penny is pretty sick and she's not going to be able to go to Switzerland. So if you're still interested, you're welcome to come. ",3,Big Bang Theory,152,27
13181,Sheldon,15," Great. I'll start packing. In a minute.  Oh, look, it's the cholermus.",3,Big Bang Theory,71,12
13183,Penny,15, Here's your soup.,3,Big Bang Theory,18,3
13184,Sheldon,15, Chicken?,3,Big Bang Theory,9,1
13185,Penny,15, Yes.,3,Big Bang Theory,5,1
13186,Sheldon,15, With the little stars?,3,Big Bang Theory,23,4
13187,Penny,15, Yes.,3,Big Bang Theory,5,1
13188,Sheldon,15, Heated to 180 degrees?,3,Big Bang Theory,23,4
13189,Penny,15," Why don't I pour it in your lap, and you can tell me.",3,Big Bang Theory,54,13
13190,Sheldon,15, You don't have to be mean. I'm sick.,3,Big Bang Theory,37,8
13191,Penny,15," Yeah, well, I'm sick, too.",3,Big Bang Theory,27,5
13192,Sheldon,15," Not my problem. I just don't understand how this happened to me. I'm scrupulous about my hygiene. I regularly disinfect my hands, and I avoid contact with other people on general principle.",3,Big Bang Theory,190,32
13193,Penny,15," I don't know what to tell you, Sheldon.",3,Big Bang Theory,40,8
13194,Sheldon,15, It's you! I touched you!,3,Big Bang Theory,25,5
13195,Penny,15, Happy Valentine's Day.,3,Big Bang Theory,23,3
13197,Raj,15," Oh, my goodness, look at this room! Champagne! Roses! Oh, and little chocolates! This is going to be the best Valentine's Day ever.",3,Big Bang Theory,132,23
13198,Leonard,15," Yeah, I forgot about all this.",3,Big Bang Theory,31,6
13199,Raj,15, But I never will.,3,Big Bang Theory,18,4
13201,Leonard,16, Will you please turn your shirt off?,3,Big Bang Theory,37,7
13202,Raj,16, What? I'm giving myself dramatic entrance music. People will know I'm awesome and to be feared.,3,Big Bang Theory,96,16
13203,Howard,16," Yeah, right, there's nothing more awesome and frightening than a man who's got music blasting from between his nipples.",3,Big Bang Theory,120,19
13204,Leonard,16," Hey, Stuart, what's going on?",3,Big Bang Theory,30,5
13206,Sheldon,16, Did he finally write a sequel to his autobiography? I'm sure ages 79 through 87 were just action-packed.,3,Big Bang Theory,105,18
13208,Sheldon,16," Oh, I don't want to know that! How can I possibly discuss with Stan Lee the scientific foundations for interstellar flight on a silver surfboard when part of my brain will be scanning his face for signs of contagious skin disease?",3,Big Bang Theory,231,41
13209,Leonard,16, Stan Lee does not have a contagious skin disease.,3,Big Bang Theory,50,9
13210,Sheldon,16," Well, look who thinks he's Stuart's uncle now.",3,Big Bang Theory,47,8
13211,Raj,16, Can't believe it. We're going to meet Stan Lee! ,3,Big Bang Theory,49,9
13212,Howard,16, I'm sad to say I taught him those moves.,3,Big Bang Theory,41,9
13214,Leonard,16," I can't decide whether I want Stan Lee to autograph my Journey into Mystery 83, first appearance of Thor or my Fantastic Four number five, first appearance of Dr. Doom.  Alex, I'm going to go with what is you're a dumbass? ",3,Big Bang Theory,224,41
13215,Sheldon,16, I've decided I'm going to have Mr. Lee sign my copy of this month's Batman.,3,Big Bang Theory,76,15
13216,Howard,16, That's crazy. Stan Lee had nothing to do with Batman.,3,Big Bang Theory,54,10
13217,Sheldon,16," Yes, which is why no one else will ask him to sign one, and I will be the possessor of a unique, albeit confusing, artifact, which will set me apart from the hoi polloi of comic book fandom.",3,Big Bang Theory,191,38
13218,Raj,16," That's a great idea, I'm going to get him to sign a Batman as well.",3,Big Bang Theory,68,15
13219,Sheldon,16, What is it about the word unique you don't understand?,3,Big Bang Theory,55,10
13220,Howard,16," Ow! Damn, paper cut. Nothing worse than a paper cut.",3,Big Bang Theory,53,10
13221,Raj,16," Well, obviously you don't remember your circumcision.",3,Big Bang Theory,54,7
13222,Sheldon,16, There's Neosporin and Band-Aids in my top desk drawer.,3,Big Bang Theory,55,9
13223,Howard,16, Why don't you keep that stuff in the bathroom?,3,Big Bang Theory,47,9
13224,Leonard,16, He does. And in the kitchen. And in the car. And in his pocket.,3,Big Bang Theory,64,14
13225,Sheldon,16," Yeah, but the ones in my pocket are mine.",3,Big Bang Theory,42,9
13226,Penny,16, Hi!,3,Big Bang Theory,4,1
13227,Leonard,16, Hey. Guess who's going to be at the comic bookstore on Thursday?,3,Big Bang Theory,65,12
13228,Penny,16," Um, can you give me a hint?",3,Big Bang Theory,28,7
13229,Leonard,16, Stan Lee.,3,Big Bang Theory,10,2
13230,Penny,16," Um, Stanley, Stanley, Stanley Tucci?",3,Big Bang Theory,37,5
13231,Leonard,16," No, no, Stan Lee.",3,Big Bang Theory,18,4
13232,Penny,16," Oh, oh, Stan Lee! Cool!",3,Big Bang Theory,24,5
13233,Leonard,16," You have no idea who he is, do you?",3,Big Bang Theory,36,9
13234,Penny,16, Of course I do. You're an important part of my life and I pay attention to the things you are interested in.,3,Big Bang Theory,109,22
13235,Leonard,16," Good, good, so, who's Stan Lee?",3,Big Bang Theory,32,6
13236,Penny,16," Um, he was on Star Trek.",3,Big Bang Theory,25,6
13237,Leonard,16, Nope.,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
13238,Penny,16, Star Wars?,3,Big Bang Theory,11,2
13239,Leonard,16, No.,3,Big Bang Theory,4,1
13240,Penny,16," Um, uh, Stan Lee, oh, he was in those goofy kung fu movies you love so much?",3,Big Bang Theory,77,17
13241,Leonard,16, That's Bruce Lee.,3,Big Bang Theory,18,3
13242,Penny,16," Oh. So, is this Bruce Lee's nerdy brother, Stan?",3,Big Bang Theory,49,9
13243,Howard,16," Sheldon, why do you have all these unopened paychecks in your desk?",3,Big Bang Theory,68,12
13244,Sheldon,16, Because most of the things I'm planning to buy haven't been invented yet.,3,Big Bang Theory,74,13
13245,Howard,16, But there must be thousands of dollars here. Why don't you put it in the bank?,3,Big Bang Theory,79,16
13246,Sheldon,16," I don't trust banks. I believe that when the robots rise up, ATMs will lead the charge.",3,Big Bang Theory,88,17
13247,Howard,16, You've also got something from the Pasadena Municipal Court.,3,Big Bang Theory,61,9
13248,Sheldon,16," Undoubtedly yet another snide response to my repeated letters complaining that the flags in front of the courthouse are flying in the wrong order. From left to right, it's supposed to be federal, state, and then city of Pasadena.",3,Big Bang Theory,230,39
13249,Penny,16, I'm sorry. You sent more than one letter about that?,3,Big Bang Theory,53,10
13250,Sheldon,16, It bothers me.,3,Big Bang Theory,15,3
13251,Howard,16," Sheldon, this is a summons.",3,Big Bang Theory,28,5
13252,Sheldon,16, A summons for what?,3,Big Bang Theory,20,4
13253,Sheldon,16," November 16? Penny, that's the evening you fell in your bathtub and I had to drive you to the emergency room.",3,Big Bang Theory,110,21
13254,Penny,16," No, it isn't.",3,Big Bang Theory,14,3
13255,Sheldon,16," Yes, it is.",3,Big Bang Theory,12,3
13256,Penny,16," No, it isn't.",3,Big Bang Theory,14,3
13257,Sheldon,16," Penny, I have an eidetic memory. Also, that's a picture of you in the passenger seat holding your dislocated shoulder.",3,Big Bang Theory,119,20
13258,Penny,16," Mmm, no, it isn't.",3,Big Bang Theory,19,4
13259,Sheldon,16," Okay, then why is a summons for a traffic violation committed in your car, bearing your license plates, coming to me?",3,Big Bang Theory,118,21
13260,Penny,16," Okay, look, they sent me the ticket. I told them I wasn't driving and they were all, if it wasn't you, who was it?",3,Big Bang Theory,115,24
13261,Sheldon,16, So you betrayed me?,3,Big Bang Theory,20,4
13262,Penny,16, No! It wasn't a betrayal. It was more of a can't afford any more points on my license. I already have to buy my insurance from this place in the Cayman Islands.,3,Big Bang Theory,161,32
13263,Sheldon,16, But the only reason I was driving your car was because you were in distress and I was rescuing you.,3,Big Bang Theory,100,20
13264,Penny,16," Yes, yes, look, and now you have a photo to remember that heroic day.",3,Big Bang Theory,70,14
13265,Leonard,16, It's not that big a deal. You just go down to the court on Thursday and you pay the fine.,3,Big Bang Theory,90,20
13266,Sheldon,16, I'm not going to pay a fine. That would imply I'm guilty.,3,Big Bang Theory,58,12
13267,Howard,16, You are guilty.  That one I liked.,3,Big Bang Theory,35,7
13268,Sheldon,16," I am not guilty. I only have a learner's permit, Penny was the teacher. When the light turned yellow she said go, go, go, so I went, went, went.",3,Big Bang Theory,145,29
13269,Penny,16," Sheldon, I'm sorry. I'll be happy to reimburse you for the fine. You know, as soon as I get a part in a movie or my own TV series.",3,Big Bang Theory,131,29
13270,Sheldon,16," You don't need to reimburse me because I'm not paying. On Thursday, I will have my day in court and justice will be done. In fact, I'm going to begin preparing my defence right now.",3,Big Bang Theory,182,35
13271,Howard,16," Okay, he's going to jail.",3,Big Bang Theory,26,5
13272,Leonard,16," Oh, that's right. Thursday is Stan Lee Day.",3,Big Bang Theory,44,8
13273,Sheldon,16," Now you see what you've done? Because of you, we're all going to miss Stan Lee.",3,Big Bang Theory,80,16
13274,Leonard,16, Whoa! What do you mean all?,3,Big Bang Theory,28,6
13275,Sheldon,16," Well, you're my friends. You'll be standing by my side, supporting me, feeding me legal precedents, and if you had the upper body strength, carrying me out on your shoulders when I'm victorious.",3,Big Bang Theory,195,33
13276,Leonard,16," Yeah, okay. No.",3,Big Bang Theory,16,3
13277,Sheldon,16, Are you saying that you will not stand beside me as I plead my case?,3,Big Bang Theory,69,15
13278,Leonard,16, That's what I'm saying.,3,Big Bang Theory,24,4
13279,Sheldon,16, Howard?,3,Big Bang Theory,8,1
13280,Howard,16," Wow. Uh, Stan Lee, or you in court? Uh, if this was Sophie's Choice it would've been a much shorter movie. No.",3,Big Bang Theory,111,22
13281,Sheldon,16," Raj? You'll be there, won't you?  All right, then, my so-called friends have forsaken me. So, I guess it'll just be me and my eyewitness.",3,Big Bang Theory,138,25
13282,Penny,16," Oh, balls.",3,Big Bang Theory,11,2
13283,Sheldon,16, Please try to wear something appropriate. It won't help my case if the judge is busy trying to read the word Juicy scrawled across your buttocks.,3,Big Bang Theory,146,26
13285,Sheldon,16,  Penny.  Penny.,3,Big Bang Theory,16,2
13286,Penny,16,  Penny.,3,Big Bang Theory,8,1
13287,Sheldon,16, That's just wrong.,3,Big Bang Theory,19,3
13288,Penny,16," All right, let's go.",3,Big Bang Theory,21,4
13289,Sheldon,16," Wait, hold on. Before we get to the courthouse, I'd like to call on your skills as an actress.",3,Big Bang Theory,95,19
13290,Penny,16, What is this?,3,Big Bang Theory,14,3
13291,Sheldon,16," I've taken the liberty of scripting your appearance on the witness stand because, let's face it, you're somewhat of a loose cannon. Now, don't worry, it's written in your vernacular. So shall we rehearse?",3,Big Bang Theory,205,34
13292,Penny,16, Do I have a choice?,3,Big Bang Theory,20,5
13293,Sheldon,16," Well, of course you have a choice. Although we live in a deterministic universe, each individual has free will. Now, sit down. I call your attention to the events of November 16. Do you remember that date?",3,Big Bang Theory,206,37
13294,Penny,16," Darn tootin', I do, if the court will excuse my homespun, corn-fed Nebraskan turn of phrase.",3,Big Bang Theory,93,16
13295,Sheldon,16, Excellent. Go on.,3,Big Bang Theory,18,3
13296,Penny,16," The reason that date is, like, so totally fixed in my memory is that I had the privilege to be witness to one of the most heroic acts I've ever seen in, like, ever.",3,Big Bang Theory,165,34
13297,Sheldon,16, And who performed that heroic act?,3,Big Bang Theory,35,6
13298,Penny,16," Why, you did, sir. You. Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and may I add, it is a privilege to know you.",3,Big Bang Theory,90,19
13299,Sheldon,16," There's no need for compliments, this court is only interested in the facts.",3,Big Bang Theory,77,13
13300,Penny,16, But it is a fact that it's a privilege to know you. Totally. A teardrop rolls down my cheek?,3,Big Bang Theory,93,19
13301,Sheldon,16, Only a suggestion. A catch in your throat would work just as well.,3,Big Bang Theory,67,13
13302,Penny,16, But it is a fact that it's a privilege to know you. Totally.,3,Big Bang Theory,61,13
13303,Sheldon,16, Maybe you should put on your Juicy pants again.,3,Big Bang Theory,48,9
13306,Sheldon,16," Good morning, Your Honour. Dr. Sheldon Cooper appearing in pro se. That is to say, representing himself.",3,Big Bang Theory,105,17
13308,Sheldon,16," And yet you wound up in traffic court. Anyway, if it would please the court, I'd like to begin with an opening statement.",3,Big Bang Theory,122,23
13310,Sheldon,16," Very well, a quick opening statement. Like a milking stool, my case rests on three legs. I will demonstrate that I was improperly instructed in driving by a woman whose lack of respect for society borders on the sociopathic. I will argue that the emergency met the legal doctrine of quod est necessarium est licitum, that which is necessary is legal. But first, I will raise a Sixth Amendment issue. I'm unable to confront my accuser, a non-human entity, to wit, a camera. So, to sum up, improper instruction, quod est necessarium est licitum, Sixth Amendment. My milk stool is complete.",3,Big Bang Theory,588,101
13312,Sheldon,16, Thank you.,3,Big Bang Theory,11,2
13314,Sheldon,16, I object. You're completely ignoring the law.,3,Big Bang Theory,46,7
13316,Sheldon,16," Really? I would point out that I am at the top of my profession, while you preside over the kiddy table of yours.",3,Big Bang Theory,114,23
13318,Sheldon,16, I am a scientist. I never apologize for the truth.,3,Big Bang Theory,51,10
13320,Sheldon,16, That's my spot.,3,Big Bang Theory,16,3
13322,Raj,16, I can't wait to ask Stan Lee why he insists on giving all his characters first and last names that start with the same letter.,3,Big Bang Theory,127,25
13323,Leonard,16," Oh, come on, why would you do that?",3,Big Bang Theory,36,8
13324,Raj,16," Bruce Banner, Reed Richards, Sue Storm, Stephen Strange, Otto Octavius, Silver Surfer, Peter Parker, oh, and worst of all, J. Jonah Jameson, Jr.",3,Big Bang Theory,145,23
13325,Howard,16," Okay, I'm cutting. I'm not gonna talk to Stan Lee after you cheese him off.",3,Big Bang Theory,76,15
13326,Leonard,16, Hey.,3,Big Bang Theory,5,1
13327,Penny,16, Sheldon's in jail.,3,Big Bang Theory,19,3
13328,Leonard,16, Sheldon's in jail?,3,Big Bang Theory,19,3
13329,Raj,16, You called it.,3,Big Bang Theory,15,3
13330,Leonard,16, For what?,3,Big Bang Theory,10,2
13331,Penny,16," What do you think? For doing the same crap he always does, except to a judge. He has to stay in there until he apologizes.",3,Big Bang Theory,123,25
13332,Leonard,16, So tell him to apologize.,3,Big Bang Theory,26,5
13333,Penny,16," Oh, gee, thanks, Leonard. That didn't occur to me. If he doesn't apologize by 5 o'clock he is going to spend the night in jail.",3,Big Bang Theory,128,25
13334,Leonard,16," Oh, no, that's terrible. Ooh, the line's moving. Got to go. Bye.",3,Big Bang Theory,65,12
13336,Sheldon,16," Excuse me? Excuse me, jailor?",3,Big Bang Theory,30,5
13338,Sheldon,16, I need to use the restroom.,3,Big Bang Theory,28,6
13340,Sheldon,16, That's the toilet?,3,Big Bang Theory,19,3
13342,Sheldon,16, Please tell the judge I'm ready to apologize.,3,Big Bang Theory,46,8
13344,Leonard,16," Look at that. To my friend, Leonard, from Stan Lee, Excelsior!",3,Big Bang Theory,63,11
13345,Howard,16," Awesome. Mine says, To my friend, Howard, from Stan Lee, Excelsior!",3,Big Bang Theory,68,11
13346,Raj,16," Mine says, To Raj, from Stan Lee.",3,Big Bang Theory,34,7
13347,Howard,16, That's 'cause you pissed him off about his character names.,3,Big Bang Theory,60,10
13348,Raj,16," Hey, I didn't even mention Dum Dum Dugan or Green Goblin, Matt Murdock, Pepper Potts, Victor Von Doom, oh, and worst of all, Millie the Model.",3,Big Bang Theory,143,26
13349,Penny,16, We're home.,3,Big Bang Theory,12,2
13350,Leonard,16," Oh, hey, buddy. How'd it go?",3,Big Bang Theory,29,6
13351,Sheldon,16, You know very well how it went.,3,Big Bang Theory,32,7
13352,Leonard,16," Yeah, but we all want to hear it from you.",3,Big Bang Theory,43,10
13353,Sheldon,16, I was found guilty and fined $533.,3,Big Bang Theory,35,7
13354,Penny,16," I'm going to write you a cheque for that. As long as you promise to put it in your drawer and never cash it, like the others.",3,Big Bang Theory,126,27
13355,Sheldon,16," I also now have three points on a driver's licence I do not yet possess, and I was forced to issue an undeserved apology, simply because I refuse to urinate in a stainless steel bowl in front of criminals.",3,Big Bang Theory,206,39
13356,Howard,16," Plus, you didn't get to meet Stan Lee.",3,Big Bang Theory,39,8
13357,Leonard,16," Okay, that's enough, Howard. The poor guy's had a tough time. He had to spend the entire afternoon in jail wearing that suit.",3,Big Bang Theory,126,23
13358,Howard,16," You're right, so it would be cruel to mention that after he finished signing autographs, Stan Lee took Stuart and us out for gelato.",3,Big Bang Theory,133,24
13359,Sheldon,16, You had gelato with Stan Lee?,3,Big Bang Theory,30,6
13360,Howard,16, He said we could call him Stan.,3,Big Bang Theory,32,7
13361,Leonard,16, Except for Raj.,3,Big Bang Theory,16,3
13362,Sheldon,16," Well, I hope you're satisfied, Penny. You are responsible for all the evil that has befallen me today.",3,Big Bang Theory,103,18
13363,Penny,16," Okay, I realize that",3,Big Bang Theory,21,4
13364,Sheldon,16," Not finished. It is because of you that I now have a criminal record, and it is because of you that I missed out on having gelato with Stan Lee.",3,Big Bang Theory,145,30
13365,Penny,16," Okay, maybe you'll have another chance to have",3,Big Bang Theory,47,8
13366,Sheldon,16," No, no. I will never have another chance to have gelato with Stan Lee because opportunities to have gelato with Stan Lee come but once in a lifetime. The moving finger writes, and having writ, moves on!",3,Big Bang Theory,203,37
13367,Penny,16, Did he just somehow give me the finger?,3,Big Bang Theory,40,8
13368,Howard,16, Not just the finger. The moving finger.,3,Big Bang Theory,40,7
13370,Penny,16," Hey, Stuart.",3,Big Bang Theory,13,2
13372,Penny,16, What's going on?,3,Big Bang Theory,17,3
13374,Penny,16, Ah. Cool. Got any fun plans?,3,Big Bang Theory,29,6
13376,Penny,16," Oh, nice.",3,Big Bang Theory,10,2
13378,Penny,16," Oh, okay. Well, I was hoping, um, you could do me a favour.",3,Big Bang Theory,60,13
13380,Penny,16," Well, I'm kind of responsible for Sheldon missing Stan Lee, and I really want to make it up to him. So I was hoping you could give me his phone number so maybe I can arrange for them to meet.",3,Big Bang Theory,192,40
13382,Penny,16, Hmm. Damn. All right. Thank you.,3,Big Bang Theory,33,6
13384,Penny,16, Really? Great!,3,Big Bang Theory,15,2
13386,Penny,16, Then why did you tell me you had it?,3,Big Bang Theory,37,9
13388,Penny,16," I'm sorry, Stuart. Thanks anyway.",3,Big Bang Theory,34,5
13390,Penny,16, Yeah?,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
13392,Penny,16, What kind of deal?,3,Big Bang Theory,19,4
13394,Penny,16, You're extorting a date out of me?,3,Big Bang Theory,35,7
13396,Penny,16, Can I bring Leonard?,3,Big Bang Theory,21,4
13398,Penny,16, Deal.,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
13401,Sheldon,16," This is Stan Lee's front door. We were on Stan Lee's curb, then we were on Stan Lee's walk, and now we're at Stan Lee's front door.",3,Big Bang Theory,132,27
13402,Penny,16, Yup.,3,Big Bang Theory,5,1
13403,Sheldon,16," Oh, Lord, you just rang Stan Lee's doorbell. At Stan Lee's house. We're about to go in and have milk and cookies with Stan Lee.",3,Big Bang Theory,128,25
13404,Penny,16," Okay, sweetie, I don't know if we're gonna have cookies, or he's just gonna say hi, or really what's gonna happen, so just let me talk, and we'll",3,Big Bang Theory,146,28
13406,Penny,16, Are you Stan Lee?,3,Big Bang Theory,18,4
13408,Penny,16," Hi. I'm Penny. This is my friend, Sheldon.",3,Big Bang Theory,43,8
13409,Sheldon,16, We're not friends at the moment. Depends on how this goes.,3,Big Bang Theory,59,11
13410,Penny,16," Right, right. Anyway, Sheldon here is a huge fan of yours, and he was supposed to meet you the other day at the comic book store, but he kind of ended up in jail.",3,Big Bang Theory,163,34
13412,Sheldon,16, You said we were invited.,3,Big Bang Theory,26,5
13413,Penny,16," Oh, no, no, I said I'm inviting you to come with me to Stan Lee's house.",3,Big Bang Theory,73,16
13415,Sheldon,16," Well, I'm not much of a sports fan, but thank you.",3,Big Bang Theory,51,11
13416,Penny,16, I'm sorry. He doesn't really understand sarcasm.,3,Big Bang Theory,49,7
13418,Penny,16, Nice to meet you.,3,Big Bang Theory,18,4
13420,Raj,16," Fantastic Four, Daredevil, Invincible Iron Man, Happy Hogan, Curt Connors",3,Big Bang Theory,74,10
13421,Howard,16, Would you just let it go?,3,Big Bang Theory,26,6
13422,Raj,16," And worst of all, Fin Fang Foom.",3,Big Bang Theory,33,7
13423,Leonard,16," Hey, where've you been?",3,Big Bang Theory,24,4
13424,Sheldon,16," I'll tell you where I've been. You boys may have had gelato with Stan Lee and gotten autographed comics, but I saw the inside of his house and got an autographed application for a restraining order.",3,Big Bang Theory,199,36
13425,Howard,16, Sweet.,3,Big Bang Theory,7,1
13426,Sheldon,16," Plus, I get to hang out with him again at the hearing. This is going to look great hanging next to my restraining order from Leonard Nimoy.",3,Big Bang Theory,140,27
13428,Leonard,17, Why do I always have to carry the heavy stuff?,3,Big Bang Theory,47,10
13429,Sheldon,17," Well, it's very simple. In our ragtag band of scientists with nothing to lose, I'm the smart one, Wolowitz is the funny one, and Koothrappali is the lovable foreigner who struggles to understand our ways and fails. That leaves you, by default, as the muscle.",3,Big Bang Theory,259,45
13430,Leonard,17," One more floor, and I'd be the pulled muscle.",3,Big Bang Theory,46,9
13431,Penny,17," Oh, it's about time, I'm starving.",3,Big Bang Theory,35,6
13432,Leonard,17," Uh, well, we didn't actually get Chinese food.",3,Big Bang Theory,47,8
13433,Penny,17, Why not?,3,Big Bang Theory,9,2
13434,Leonard,17," Don't panic, this is better.",3,Big Bang Theory,29,5
13435,Penny,17," Oh, no, you didn't trade the food for magic beans, did you?",3,Big Bang Theory,60,12
13436,Sheldon,17," Of course not. And, technically, magic beans would be food, although eating them would be quite a waste, since you could plant them and overnight have a giant beanstalk, which would provide enough roughage for a small city.",3,Big Bang Theory,224,38
13437,Penny,17," Yeah, sometimes I don't listen, sometimes I just watch your jaw go up and down.",3,Big Bang Theory,80,15
13438,Leonard,17," We were on our way to the Chinese restaurant when we thought we saw Adam West, so we followed him.",3,Big Bang Theory,99,20
13439,Penny,17, Who's Adam West?,3,Big Bang Theory,17,3
13440,Sheldon,17," Who's Adam West? Leonard, what do the two of you talk about after the coitus?",3,Big Bang Theory,78,15
13441,Howard,17," My guess is, â€œHey, four minutes! New record!â€ù That's why I'm the funny one.",3,Big Bang Theory,80,14
13442,Leonard,17," Anyway, we followed the guy to this garage sale, and they had the coolest stuff.",3,Big Bang Theory,81,15
13443,Howard,17, They were closing up. We got this whole box for sixty bucks.,3,Big Bang Theory,61,12
13444,Leonard,17, We didn't even get to go through it all. There could be anything in here.,3,Big Bang Theory,74,15
13445,Penny,17, There a new girlfriend in there? â€˜Cause you might need one.,3,Big Bang Theory,62,11
13446,Leonard,17," No. But there is an original final draft Ghostbusters script with actual slime stains!  Oh, you're right, it's Ghostbusters 2. Never mind.",3,Big Bang Theory,139,22
13447,Howard,17," Oh, my God. An Alf doll. When I was 11 my mother got me one to help me sleep after my dad left. I used to pretend that my dad had moved to the planet Melmac, and Alf was going to bring him back to me. But he never did. Where's my daddy, puppet? Where is he?",3,Big Bang Theory,258,57
13448,Penny,17, That is so sad.,3,Big Bang Theory,16,4
13449,Sheldon,17," No, what's sad is that you don't know Adam West was TV's Batman.",3,Big Bang Theory,65,13
13451,Leonard,17," Here's Spock's head with no body. Here's Mr. T's body with no head. Oh, yeah, here's Spock's body with Mr. T's head. I pity the fool who's illogical.",3,Big Bang Theory,150,28
13452,Penny,17," Okay, I'm just gonna go home and make a grilled cheese and window-shop on eHarmony.",3,Big Bang Theory,84,15
13453,Leonard,17," Okay, bye.",3,Big Bang Theory,11,2
13454,Penny,17, Okay.,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
13455,Leonard,17," Ooh, look, an Indiana Jones connect-the-dots.",3,Big Bang Theory,46,6
13456,Raj,17, And an Aquaman action figure.,3,Big Bang Theory,30,5
13457,Howard,17, Looks like someone drew a penis on him.,3,Big Bang Theory,40,8
13458,Raj,17, Huh? That'll come off.,3,Big Bang Theory,23,4
13459,Howard,17, You see what you're doing? Stop that.,3,Big Bang Theory,38,7
13460,Sheldon,17, Fascinating.,3,Big Bang Theory,13,1
13461,Leonard,17, What?,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
13462,Sheldon,17, It appears to be a Lord of the Rings ring.,3,Big Bang Theory,43,10
13463,Leonard,17, Oh.,3,Big Bang Theory,4,1
13464,Raj,17, It's even got the Elvish engraving on it.,3,Big Bang Theory,42,8
13465,Sheldon,17, It's not Elvish. It's the language of Mordor written in Elvish script. One Ring to,3,Big Bang Theory,83,15
13466,Raj,17, One Ring to find them.,3,Big Bang Theory,23,5
13467,Howard,17, One Ring to bring them all.,3,Big Bang Theory,28,6
13468,Leonard,17, And in the darkness bind them.,3,Big Bang Theory,31,6
13469,Raj,17," Holy crap, are we nerdy.",3,Big Bang Theory,25,5
13471,Howard,17," So, I was doing some checking on the ring.",3,Big Bang Theory,43,9
13472,Raj,17," Hold on. Sheldon, is there ketchup on that table?",3,Big Bang Theory,50,9
13473,Sheldon,17," Yes, there is. Oh, here's a fun fact, ketchup started out as a general term for sauce, typically made of, uh, mushrooms or fish brine with herbs and spices. Some popular early main ingredients included blueberry, anchovy, oyster, kidney bean and grape.",3,Big Bang Theory,253,42
13474,Raj,17," No, that's okay. I'll get it.",3,Big Bang Theory,30,6
13475,Howard,17," Listen, I was looking at the ring, and it seemed a little weird. No copyright notice on it. So, I took it down to this buddy of mine who deals with, shall we say, the seedy underbelly of the collectibles world.",3,Big Bang Theory,211,41
13476,Leonard,17, Seedy underbelly?,3,Big Bang Theory,18,2
13477,Howard,17," You know, your black market phasers, your screen-worn Lieutenant Uhura panties, that kind of stuff.",3,Big Bang Theory,100,15
13478,Raj,17, Who's this mysterious buddy you suddenly have?,3,Big Bang Theory,47,7
13479,Howard,17, Just a guy. I know a guy.,3,Big Bang Theory,26,7
13480,Raj,17, Is it Eddie Crispo?,3,Big Bang Theory,20,4
13481,Howard,17," No, I can't tell you who it is. Stop asking.",3,Big Bang Theory,45,10
13482,Raj,17, Who else could it be? It has to be Eddie Crispo.,3,Big Bang Theory,49,11
13483,Howard,17," I know lots of dangerous people, okay?",3,Big Bang Theory,39,7
13484,Raj,17, Name one.,3,Big Bang Theory,10,2
13485,Howard,17," Eddie Crispo. Anyway, he said this isn't a replica. It's the real deal.",3,Big Bang Theory,72,13
13486,Sheldon,17," If you're suggesting that that is the actual ring of power forged by Sauron in Mount Doom, I look at you with an expression of exhaustion and ever so slight amusement.",3,Big Bang Theory,168,31
13487,Leonard,17," He's not saying it's a magic ring. You're not, are you?",3,Big Bang Theory,56,11
13488,Howard,17," No, but it's close. Look at the markings inside. Those are production markings. Nine rings were made for use in the Lord of the Rings movies. Three were given to members of the cast. The rest were destroyed. Except one. One was stolen. Gentlemen, this is the one ring.",3,Big Bang Theory,269,49
13489,Sheldon,17, Mine!,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
13490,Leonard,17," No, it is not yours. We all went in on the box together.",3,Big Bang Theory,57,13
13491,Sheldon,17," Well, yes, but I found it in the box, and the laws of maritime salvage clearly state that the finder of a sunken treasure is the owner of the treasure.",3,Big Bang Theory,152,30
13492,Leonard,17, How is this maritime salvage?,3,Big Bang Theory,30,5
13493,Sheldon,17," Other than the lack of water, how is it not?",3,Big Bang Theory,45,10
13494,Raj,17," Wait, wait. Sheldon, stop being crazy for a second. How much is something like this worth?",3,Big Bang Theory,91,16
13495,Howard,17," Well, it's tough to say since it's hot, but on the underground market, my guy figures",3,Big Bang Theory,86,16
13496,Raj,17, Your guy Eddie Crispo?,3,Big Bang Theory,23,4
13497,Howard,17," Yes. He figures ten, maybe 15 thousand.",3,Big Bang Theory,40,7
13498,Raj,17," Okay, that's a lot of money. The wise thing to do is invest it in something practical. Like a jet ski.",3,Big Bang Theory,103,21
13499,Howard,17, Why do you want a jet ski?,3,Big Bang Theory,27,7
13500,Raj,17, All the wealthy and beautiful people in movies ride Jet Skis. That can't just be a coincidence.,3,Big Bang Theory,96,17
13501,Sheldon,17," We can't sell it. We have to keep it and love it and polish it, and only take it out occasionally when we go to the park and re-enact our favourite scenes from the movies.",3,Big Bang Theory,172,35
13502,Howard,17, It's sad how great that sounds.,3,Big Bang Theory,32,6
13503,Leonard,17," Guys, it's stolen. It should go back to Peter Jackson. He made the movies, it belongs to him.",3,Big Bang Theory,94,18
13504,Howard,17, Fine. He can have it back as long as he promises to make me a hobbit in his next movie.,3,Big Bang Theory,88,20
13505,Raj,17, There are no Jewish hobbits.,3,Big Bang Theory,29,5
13506,Howard,17," Clearly, you've never been to my house for dinner on Rosh Hashanah.",3,Big Bang Theory,68,12
13507,Leonard,17," We are not blackmailing Peter J All right, where's the ring?",3,Big Bang Theory,61,11
13508,Sheldon,17, You mean my ring?,3,Big Bang Theory,18,4
13509,Leonard,17, What are you doing?,3,Big Bang Theory,20,4
13510,Sheldon,17," The ring was unguarded, it was just sitting on the table, anyone could have taken it. Proof? I did.",3,Big Bang Theory,100,19
13511,Leonard,17, Give me that.,3,Big Bang Theory,14,3
13512,Raj,17," Look, let's be reasonable. We all want to do different things with the ring, but your ideas are stupid, and I want a jet ski.",3,Big Bang Theory,126,25
13513,Sheldon,17, I found it. The ring is mine. I don't understand why in this group I never get my way.,3,Big Bang Theory,87,19
13514,Leonard,17, You always get your way.,3,Big Bang Theory,25,5
13515,Sheldon,17, I'll stipulate to that if you give me the ring.,3,Big Bang Theory,48,10
13516,Penny,17," Hey, guys. Enjoying your food that I actually brought you instead of promising food, but bringing you a box of random crap?",3,Big Bang Theory,124,22
13517,Leonard,17," Yeah, it's delicious, the sarcasm's a little stale, though. Hey, how about this? Until we figure out what to do with the ring, Penny holds on to it.",3,Big Bang Theory,149,28
13518,Penny,17, What ring?,3,Big Bang Theory,11,2
13519,Leonard,17, This ring.,3,Big Bang Theory,11,2
13520,Sheldon,17, Looking for something?,3,Big Bang Theory,23,3
13521,Leonard,17, Will you hold on to this for a couple of days?,3,Big Bang Theory,47,11
13522,Penny,17, Why?,3,Big Bang Theory,5,1
13523,Leonard,17," It's a prop from a movie, and we're kind of fighting over it.",3,Big Bang Theory,62,13
13524,Penny,17," Okay, just to be clear, the first piece of jewellery my boyfriend gives me is a prop from a movie, and I don't even get to keep it?",3,Big Bang Theory,132,28
13525,Howard,17," If you had gone out with me three years ago, by now, you'd have my great Aunt Ida's brooch that she smuggled out of occupied Belgium in a cat.",3,Big Bang Theory,143,29
13526,Leonard,17, How am I looking now?,3,Big Bang Theory,22,5
13528,Sheldon,17, Ow! You hit me! I'm bleeding!,3,Big Bang Theory,30,6
13529,Leonard,17, What was that?,3,Big Bang Theory,15,3
13530,Penny,17, Sheldon tried to take the ring and I punched him.,3,Big Bang Theory,50,10
13531,Leonard,17, That's my girl.,3,Big Bang Theory,16,3
13533,Howard,17," So, Sheldon, how's it feel to get beaten up by a girl?",3,Big Bang Theory,55,12
13534,Sheldon,17," It's not the first time. I have a twin sister whose assaults began in utero. If only I'd had the presence of mind to reabsorb her, then I'd have a mole with hair in it instead of a tedious yearly Christmas letter.",3,Big Bang Theory,214,42
13535,Raj,17," Gentlemen, have you come to the realization that the only reasonable course of action is to sell the ring and divide the money?",3,Big Bang Theory,128,23
13536,Leonard,17, No.,3,Big Bang Theory,4,1
13537,Raj,17, I was afraid of that.  Go ahead.,3,Big Bang Theory,33,7
13539,Raj,17, Also my cousin.,3,Big Bang Theory,16,3
13540,Howard,17, You brought a lawyer?,3,Big Bang Theory,22,4
13542,Leonard,17, We're not giving him two Jet Skis.,3,Big Bang Theory,35,7
13544,Leonard,17, No Jet Skis.,3,Big Bang Theory,13,3
13546,Raj,17, Forget the Jet Skis? That was our line in the sand! What happened to â€œtear them a new one?â€ù,3,Big Bang Theory,96,19
13548,Raj,17, You're useless.,3,Big Bang Theory,16,2
13550,Raj,17, I'm signing off now.,3,Big Bang Theory,21,4
13552,Howard,17," Okay, just so you know, if we're bringing in cousins who are lawyers, prepare for shock and awe.",3,Big Bang Theory,97,18
13553,Leonard,17," You know what? I am ending this. Penny didn't want to hold the ring anymore. She gave it to me, I have it. I'm sending it back. Where's the ring?",3,Big Bang Theory,146,30
13554,Sheldon,17, You mean this ring? Next time be aware of your surroundings while urinating in a public men's room.,3,Big Bang Theory,100,18
13555,Leonard,17, Give me that.,3,Big Bang Theory,14,3
13556,Sheldon,17," No, it's mine.",3,Big Bang Theory,15,3
13557,Raj,17, It's all of ours. ,3,Big Bang Theory,19,4
13558,Leonard,17," Okay, now, this is ridiculous!",3,Big Bang Theory,31,5
13559,Howard,17, Then let go!,3,Big Bang Theory,13,3
13560,Leonard,17," I'm not letting go, you let go.",3,Big Bang Theory,32,7
13561,Howard,17, I say this ring belongs to the last person who can hold on.,3,Big Bang Theory,60,13
13562,Leonard,17, Fine. But can't we go home and start this?,3,Big Bang Theory,43,9
13563,Raj,17, Sure. Let go of the ring.,3,Big Bang Theory,26,6
13564,Leonard,17," All right, it starts now.",3,Big Bang Theory,26,5
13565,Howard,17, You do realize there's a giant bug movie marathon tonight on the Syfy Channel. ,3,Big Bang Theory,80,14
13566,Raj,17," Wait, my laptop. ",3,Big Bang Theory,18,3
13568,Howard,17," You know, there's a point when this becomes idiotic.",3,Big Bang Theory,53,9
13569,Leonard,17, And it wasn't when we were driving like this?,3,Big Bang Theory,46,9
13570,Sheldon,17, I would advise the three of you that resistance is futile. I have endless patience. I once spent two-and-a-half hours on hold with Hewlett-Packard customer service just to complain about their customer service.,3,Big Bang Theory,211,33
13571,Leonard,17, You want to talk about endless patience? Penny made me watch all five seasons of Sex and the City.,3,Big Bang Theory,99,19
13572,Raj,17," There are six seasons, dude.",3,Big Bang Theory,29,5
13573,Leonard,17," Oh, crap!",3,Big Bang Theory,10,2
13574,Raj,17," No, no, no, the sixth season is great. We go to Paris with Carrie and get our heart broken, and then Mr. Big shows up, we don't know if we can trust him again. It's a wild ride.",3,Big Bang Theory,178,38
13575,Leonard,17, Door. ,3,Big Bang Theory,7,1
13576,Raj,17," Okay, everybody, and plie. And relevae.",3,Big Bang Theory,40,6
13577,Penny,17, Whatcha doin'?,3,Big Bang Theory,15,2
13578,Leonard,17," Last one holding the ring decides its fate. I know, it sounds silly.",3,Big Bang Theory,69,13
13579,Penny,17," No, no, no, no, no, no, you are my boyfriend. Nothing you do is silly to me.",3,Big Bang Theory,77,17
13580,Leonard,17, Thank you.,3,Big Bang Theory,11,2
13581,Penny,17," FYI, this is a bag from Victoria's Secret.",3,Big Bang Theory,43,8
13582,Leonard,17, I'm out.,3,Big Bang Theory,9,2
13584,Howard,17," I'm sorry, Ma, I have to stay late at the office.",3,Big Bang Theory,50,11
13585,Raj,17," No, he's doesn't! He's lying to you!",3,Big Bang Theory,37,7
13586,Howard,17, Will you be quiet?,3,Big Bang Theory,19,4
13587,Raj,17," Well, if you want privacy let go of the ring. I'm so glad we came to this gentile strip club! Howard, here's more bacon to tuck into the shiksa's G-string!",3,Big Bang Theory,156,30
13588,Howard,17, I'll call you back.,3,Big Bang Theory,20,4
13589,Raj,17," I think it's lovely you call your mommy and let her know you're going to be late for dinner. From what I know about these things, if a woman doesn't breast-feed on time, it's very uncomfortable for her boobies.",3,Big Bang Theory,211,39
13590,Howard,17, Don't you talk about my mother's boobies!,3,Big Bang Theory,42,7
13591,Raj,17," If you're offended, let go of the ring and go on home to your mother's boobies.",3,Big Bang Theory,80,16
13592,Sheldon,17," Excellent, excellent. Tire each other out, the ring will be mine. Howard, why don't you go after Raj's mother?",3,Big Bang Theory,111,19
13593,Raj,17, Why don't we go after your mother?,3,Big Bang Theory,35,7
13594,Sheldon,17," Go ahead. I have no illusions about my mother. She is a kind, loving, religiously fanatical right-wing Texan with a slightly out-of-scale head and a mild Dr. Pepper addiction. Anything you'd like to add?",3,Big Bang Theory,204,34
13595,Howard,17, That's not gonna Better pull out the big gun.,3,Big Bang Theory,46,9
13596,Raj,17, You're right. Let's talk about your grandmother.,3,Big Bang Theory,49,7
13597,Sheldon,17, No! I call no Meemaws.,3,Big Bang Theory,23,5
13598,Raj,17, Think about this. The only way your mother was born was your Meemaw had sex.,3,Big Bang Theory,77,15
13599,Sheldon,17, I don't want to hear this.,3,Big Bang Theory,27,6
13600,Howard,17, Then let go of the ring and walk away.,3,Big Bang Theory,39,9
13601,Sheldon,17, Never.,3,Big Bang Theory,7,1
13602,Howard,17, All right. I'll bet your Meemaw didn't just have sex to have your mother. I bet she had sex because she liked it.,3,Big Bang Theory,114,23
13603,Sheldon,17, Stop it!,3,Big Bang Theory,9,2
13604,Raj,17," Yeah, Meemaw did the nasty.",3,Big Bang Theory,28,5
13605,Sheldon,17, I said stop it!,3,Big Bang Theory,16,4
13606,Howard,17, We're getting to him.,3,Big Bang Theory,22,4
13607,Sheldon,17, Waterfalls!,3,Big Bang Theory,12,1
13608,Raj,17, What?,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
13609,Sheldon,17, Waterfalls. Crashing waves. Babbling brooks.,3,Big Bang Theory,45,5
13610,Howard,17, What are you doing?,3,Big Bang Theory,20,4
13611,Sheldon,17, Subliminal messaging. I'm going to make you want to pee. Dripping faucets. Leaky gutter. Peeing.,3,Big Bang Theory,97,15
13612,Raj,17," It's, it's not working, dude.",3,Big Bang Theory,30,5
13613,Sheldon,17," Oh-ho-ho, it's working all right. I have to pee.",3,Big Bang Theory,49,9
13614,Raj,17, Then let go of the ring and go.,3,Big Bang Theory,32,8
13615,Howard,17," No, actually, I wouldn't mind going, too.",3,Big Bang Theory,42,7
13616,Raj,17," Fine. Um, on the count of three. One, two",3,Big Bang Theory,42,9
13617,Sheldon,17," Wait, just to clarify. When you get to three, do we stand up or do we pee?",3,Big Bang Theory,75,17
13618,Howard,17, We stand up.,3,Big Bang Theory,13,3
13619,Sheldon,17, Excellent choice.,3,Big Bang Theory,18,2
13620,Raj,17, Three.,3,Big Bang Theory,7,1
13621,Howard,17, Something tells me this was a bad day to wear suede shoes.,3,Big Bang Theory,59,12
13623,Sheldon,17, I've done it! I've won! The ring is mine! It's mine!  We're going to clean it up and make it pretty. My own. My love. My precious.  Where's the ring?,3,Big Bang Theory,150,30
13624,Leonard,17, It's in a FedEx box on its way back to where it came from.,3,Big Bang Theory,59,14
13625,Raj,17, The fires of Mount Doom?,3,Big Bang Theory,25,5
13626,Leonard,17, Peter Jackson's office in New Zealand. It wasn't ours.,3,Big Bang Theory,55,9
13627,Howard,17, You quit the game! You had no right to take it.,3,Big Bang Theory,48,11
13628,Leonard,17," I came in here, you guys were all sleeping. The ring was on the floor. No one was touching it.",3,Big Bang Theory,95,20
13629,Raj,17," Well, so then we start the game over until there's a winner.",3,Big Bang Theory,61,12
13630,Leonard,17," There wasn't ever going to be a winner. There was going to be a selfish, petty person with a ring and three people who used to be his friend. Is that really what you guys want? â€˜Cause if it is, fine, I don't want anything to do with you. And I don't know what happened in that bathroom, but I am not cleaning it up!  My precious.",3,Big Bang Theory,332,67
13632,Sheldon,17, I knew it. Give us the precious!,3,Big Bang Theory,33,7
13633,Leonard,17, NEVER!,3,Big Bang Theory,7,1
13634,Penny,17," Ugh, gotta go back to dating dumb guys from the gym.",3,Big Bang Theory,53,11
13636,Raj,18," Okay in Avatar when they have sex in Pandora they hook up their ponytails, so we know their ponytails are like their junk.",3,Big Bang Theory,123,23
13637,Howard,18," Yeah, so?",3,Big Bang Theory,10,2
13638,Raj,18," So, when they ride horses and fly on the birds, they also use their ponytails.",3,Big Bang Theory,79,15
13639,Howard,18, What's your point?,3,Big Bang Theory,19,3
13640,Raj,18," My point is, if I were a horse or a bird, I'd be very nervous around James Cameron.",3,Big Bang Theory,84,18
13641,Sheldon,18," It amazes me how you constantly obsess over fictional details when there are more important things in the real world to worry about. For example, why wasn't William Shatner in the new Star Trek movie?",3,Big Bang Theory,201,35
13642,Leonard,18," Hey, Sheldon, I was up in the administration office, and I happened to overhear the name of the winner of this year's Chancellor's Award for Science.",3,Big Bang Theory,150,26
13643,Sheldon,18," And you want to rub my nose in the fact that my contributions are being overlooked again? I am the William Shatner of theoretical physics. All right, I'll play. What self-important, preening fraud are they honouring this year?",3,Big Bang Theory,227,38
13644,Leonard,18," Oh, I'm so glad you asked it like that. You.",3,Big Bang Theory,45,10
13645,Sheldon,18, I won?,3,Big Bang Theory,7,2
13646,Leonard,18, You won.,3,Big Bang Theory,9,2
13647,Sheldon,18," I won! This is astonishing. Not that I won the award, no one deserves it more. Actually, I guess I misspoke. It's not astonishing, more like inevitable. I'm not sure what to do first. Maybe I should call my mother. Wait! I know, I'm going to conduct an interview with myself and post it online.",3,Big Bang Theory,295,55
13648,Raj,18," Well, good for him.",3,Big Bang Theory,20,4
13649,Howard,18," Yeah, the one thing the William Shatner of theoretical physics needed was an ego boost.",3,Big Bang Theory,88,15
13651,Howard,18, Didn't it look like that spear was going to go right through your skull?,3,Big Bang Theory,73,14
13652,Raj,18, No.,3,Big Bang Theory,4,1
13653,Leonard,18," Hey, you didn't want a Slurpee at 7-Eleven, you don't get glasses.",3,Big Bang Theory,67,12
13654,Sheldon,18," Oh, that will be another congratulatory call for me. Uh, mute, please.",3,Big Bang Theory,71,12
13655,Howard,18," Uh, hang on, flaming arrow.",3,Big Bang Theory,28,5
13656,Sheldon,18," Hello? Oh, Chancellor Morton, how are you, sir? Yes, I was expecting your call  three years ago. I see. Wait. What happens if I choose not to give a speech? Uh-huh. And if I don't want to forfeit the award? Well, you've got that tied up in a neat little bow. All right. Thank you.  Problem.",3,Big Bang Theory,291,56
13657,Leonard,18, What?,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
13658,Sheldon,18, They expect me to give a speech at the banquet. I can't give a speech.,3,Big Bang Theory,71,15
13659,Howard,18," Well, no, you're mistaken. You give speeches all the time. What you can't do is shut up.",3,Big Bang Theory,89,17
13660,Raj,18," Yeah, before the movie, you did 20 minutes on why guacamole turns brown. It turned brown while you were talking.",3,Big Bang Theory,113,20
13661,Sheldon,18, I am perfectly comfortable speaking to small groups. I cannot speak to large crowds.,3,Big Bang Theory,85,14
13662,Leonard,18," What, to you, is a large crowd?",3,Big Bang Theory,32,7
13663,Sheldon,18, Any group big enough to trample me to death. General rule of thumb is 36 adults or 70 children.,3,Big Bang Theory,96,19
13664,Penny,18," Sheldon, congratulations. Brought you cheesecake from work. You know, 'cause of your award, not because a busboy sneezed on it.",3,Big Bang Theory,128,20
13665,Sheldon,18, I'm not accepting the award.,3,Big Bang Theory,29,5
13666,Penny,18, Why not?,3,Big Bang Theory,9,2
13667,Howard,18, Turns out the great Sheldon Cooper has stage fright.,3,Big Bang Theory,53,9
13668,Penny,18," That's no reason to back out. You know, I once got a pretty big honour in high school, and I was terrified about appearing in front of a big crowd, but I went through with it, and you know what? The world looked pretty darn good sitting on a haystack in the back of a Ford F-150 as a member of the Corn Queen's court.",3,Big Bang Theory,318,65
13669,Sheldon,18," Thank you. Yeah, I'll bear that in mind if I'm ever nominated for the Hillbilly Peace Prize.",3,Big Bang Theory,93,17
13670,Leonard,18," Sheldon, you're being ridiculous.",3,Big Bang Theory,34,4
13671,Sheldon,18, Am I? Let me tell you a story.,3,Big Bang Theory,31,8
13672,Howard,18, Where's 70 children when you need â€˜em?,3,Big Bang Theory,41,7
13673,Sheldon,18, I was 14 and graduating summa cum laude from college. Summa cum laude is Latin for with highest honours.,3,Big Bang Theory,105,19
13674,Penny,18, I just love how you always skip over the part where no one asks.,3,Big Bang Theory,65,14
13675,Sheldon,18," I was valedictorian and expected to give an address. Even now, I can remember that moment when I walked up to the podium and looked out at the crowd. There must have been thousands of people. My heart started pounding in my chest. I began to hyperventilate. My vision became blurry, and before I knew it oh, dear. ",3,Big Bang Theory,315,58
13676,Penny,18," Oh, my God.",3,Big Bang Theory,12,3
13677,Leonard,18," Sheldon? Sheldon, are you okay?",3,Big Bang Theory,32,5
13678,Sheldon,18, Don't trample me.,3,Big Bang Theory,18,3
13680,Sheldon,18," Come on, Mother, you know why I can't accept the award. With all due respect, I don't think praying will help. No, I have not heard the song, Jesus, Take the Wheel. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, you don't need to start singing it. Yes, I'll buy it on the iTunes, Mother. Good-bye, Mother.  Hello.",3,Big Bang Theory,295,57
13681,Leonard,18," Sit down, we want to talk to you.",3,Big Bang Theory,34,8
13682,Sheldon,18, Am I in trouble? Did my mother call you?,3,Big Bang Theory,41,9
13683,Penny,18, Just sit.,3,Big Bang Theory,10,2
13684,Leonard,18, We think we can help you with your stage fright.,3,Big Bang Theory,49,10
13685,Sheldon,18," Oh, I doubt that. I haven't figured out a way, and I'm much smarter than all of you.",3,Big Bang Theory,85,18
13686,Penny,18," Yes, but you're not smarter than all of us put together.",3,Big Bang Theory,57,11
13687,Sheldon,18," Oh, I'm sorry, that is what I meant.",3,Big Bang Theory,37,8
13688,Penny,18," Okay, your problem is, you're trying to do this all by yourself.",3,Big Bang Theory,65,12
13689,Leonard,18," We can help you. We can be your team. Like, uh, Professor Xavier and his X-Men.",3,Big Bang Theory,80,16
13690,Sheldon,18, I do like the X-Men.,3,Big Bang Theory,21,5
13691,Penny,18, Did I see X-Men?,3,Big Bang Theory,17,4
13692,Leonard,18," Yeah, we watched it last week. You said you liked it.",3,Big Bang Theory,54,11
13693,Penny,18," Oh. I say a lot of things, sweetie. So, how about it, Sheldon?",3,Big Bang Theory,63,13
13694,Sheldon,18," I don't know. If you're my X-Men, what are your powers?",3,Big Bang Theory,56,11
13695,Penny,18," Okay. Well, I am going to take you shopping, get you a nice suit. Might give you more confidence.",3,Big Bang Theory,98,19
13696,Sheldon,18," That's not exactly a mutation that would get you into Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters, but go on. Leonard?",3,Big Bang Theory,113,19
13697,Leonard,18, I thought I could try to analyze you and get to the root of your anxiety.,3,Big Bang Theory,74,16
13698,Sheldon,18, What qualifies you to attempt to understand my mind?,3,Big Bang Theory,53,9
13699,Leonard,18," My mother is a highly regarded psychiatrist, and I've been in therapy ever since she accused me of breast-feeding co-dependently.",3,Big Bang Theory,130,20
13700,Howard,18," Raj says he can teach you, what did you call it? I don't know, some Indian meditation crap.",3,Big Bang Theory,92,18
13701,Sheldon,18," I see. Well, I assume, since the rest of you have set the bar so low, you're saving the most impressive contribution for last. Go ahead, Howard. Dazzle me.",3,Big Bang Theory,156,29
13702,Howard,18," My power is the ability to pretend like I give a damn about your piddly-ass problems. And that's 24-7, buddy.",3,Big Bang Theory,110,20
13703,Sheldon,18, And I appreciate the pretence.,3,Big Bang Theory,31,5
13704,Penny,18," So, what do you say, Sheldon? Are we your X-Men?",3,Big Bang Theory,49,10
13705,Sheldon,18," No. The X-Men were named for the X in Charles Xavier. Since I am Sheldon Cooper, you will be my C-Men.",3,Big Bang Theory,103,21
13706,Howard,18," Oh, that's not a good name.",3,Big Bang Theory,28,6
13708,Raj,18," Okay, Sheldon. I'm going to be leading you through a series of meditation exercises. These methods come from the ancient gurus of India and have helped me overcome my own fears.",3,Big Bang Theory,178,31
13709,Sheldon,18," And yet, you can't speak to women.",3,Big Bang Theory,35,7
13710,Raj,18," True, but thanks to meditation, I am able to stay in the same room with them without urinating. Now, close your eyes.",3,Big Bang Theory,118,22
13711,Sheldon,18," Okay, but don't punch me.",3,Big Bang Theory,26,5
13712,Raj,18, What?,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
13713,Sheldon,18," When I was little, my sister would say to me, close your eyes, you'll get a surprise, and then she'd punch me.",3,Big Bang Theory,111,22
13714,Raj,18, I'm not going to punch you.,3,Big Bang Theory,28,6
13715,Sheldon,18, That's what my sister used to say.,3,Big Bang Theory,35,7
13716,Raj,18, Do you want to do this or not?,3,Big Bang Theory,31,8
13717,Sheldon,18, I'm sorry. Proceed.,3,Big Bang Theory,20,3
13718,Raj,18, All right. Imagine yourself in the one place you feel most at home. Where is that?,3,Big Bang Theory,83,16
13719,Sheldon,18," Sim City. More specifically, the Sim City I designed, Sheldonopolis.",3,Big Bang Theory,69,10
13720,Raj,18," Okay, you're in Sheldonopolis.",3,Big Bang Theory,31,4
13721,Sheldon,18," Where exactly? Sheldon Square? Sheldon Towers? Sheldon Stadium, home of the Fighting Sheldons?",3,Big Bang Theory,95,13
13722,Raj,18, Whatever you like.,3,Big Bang Theory,19,3
13723,Sheldon,18, I thought this was supposed to be a guided meditation.,3,Big Bang Theory,55,10
13724,Raj,18, Fine. You're in Sheldon Square.,3,Big Bang Theory,32,5
13725,Sheldon,18, Really? This time of year? It's a bit nippy.,3,Big Bang Theory,45,9
13726,Raj,18," Then, put on a sweater.",3,Big Bang Theory,24,5
13727,Sheldon,18, Suppose I could run downtown and pick up something at Shel-Mart.,3,Big Bang Theory,65,11
13728,Raj,18," Yeah, whatever. Just go buy a sweater.",3,Big Bang Theory,39,7
13729,Sheldon,18," You know, the nice thing about Shel-Mart is I own it, so I get a 15% discount.",3,Big Bang Theory,79,17
13730,Raj,18, You own the damn thing. Just take a freaking sweater!,3,Big Bang Theory,54,10
13731,Sheldon,18," Look, I didn't turn a profit last quarter by taking product off the shelves willy-nilly.",3,Big Bang Theory,89,15
13732,Raj,18," All right. You've paid for a sweater, and you're in Sheldon Square.",3,Big Bang Theory,68,12
13733,Sheldon,18," Hang on. It's a cardigan. I have to button it. Oh, no.",3,Big Bang Theory,55,12
13734,Raj,18, What now?,3,Big Bang Theory,10,2
13735,Sheldon,18," A Godzilla-like monster is approaching the city. I have to get my people to safety. People of Sheldonopolis, this is your mayor. Follow me. If the children can't run, leave them behind. Oh, the simulated horror!  Raj? Just as I suspected. Meditation is nothing but hokum.",3,Big Bang Theory,272,46
13737,Sheldon,18, I question your premise. How is a new suit going to prevent me from passing out in front of a ballroom full of people?,3,Big Bang Theory,119,24
13738,Penny,18," It'll give you confidence. You know, sometimes when I'm feeling all stressed out about something, I go out and buy a cute top or a fun skirt and I have a whole new outlook on life.",3,Big Bang Theory,181,36
13739,Sheldon,18, Don't you eventually realize you're just the same stressed out person in a cute top or a fun skirt?,3,Big Bang Theory,100,19
13740,Penny,18," Yeah, that's when I buy shoes. Now, let's see what we've got. Ooh! This is nice.",3,Big Bang Theory,81,16
13741,Sheldon,18, It's only one colour.,3,Big Bang Theory,22,4
13742,Penny,18," Yeah, so?",3,Big Bang Theory,10,2
13743,Sheldon,18, That's a lot of money for only one colour.,3,Big Bang Theory,43,9
13744,Penny,18, Fine. Why don't you pick out what you like.,3,Big Bang Theory,44,9
13745,Sheldon,18, Hmm. . This is pretty sharp.,3,Big Bang Theory,29,6
13746,Penny,18," No, you're wrong.",3,Big Bang Theory,18,3
13747,Sheldon,18," This is great. I had a suit like this when I was six.  Okay, I think we have a winner.",3,Big Bang Theory,87,20
13748,Penny,18, Where the hell d'you find that?,3,Big Bang Theory,32,6
13749,Sheldon,18, In the prom department.,3,Big Bang Theory,24,4
13750,Penny,18, It's ridiculous.,3,Big Bang Theory,17,2
13751,Sheldon,18, Says the former member of the Corn Queen's Court.,3,Big Bang Theory,50,9
13752,Penny,18, Please just try this one on.,3,Big Bang Theory,29,6
13753,Sheldon,18, Okay. But anything I put on now is only going to suffer in comparison.  This is absurd. I look like a clown.,3,Big Bang Theory,109,22
13755,Leonard,18," So, Sheldon, how you doing?",3,Big Bang Theory,28,5
13756,Sheldon,18," That's how you start a psychotherapy session? How am I doing? I was promised a riverboat journey into the jungles of my subconscious. Instead, I get the same question I hear from the lady who slices my bologna at Ralph's.",3,Big Bang Theory,222,40
13757,Leonard,18," I'm sorry, I'll start again.",3,Big Bang Theory,29,5
13758,Sheldon,18, Would it be helpful to you if I told you about my dreams?,3,Big Bang Theory,58,13
13759,Leonard,18," Um, I don't know, maybe.",3,Big Bang Theory,25,5
13760,Sheldon,18," I recently had a dream that I was a giant. But everything around me was to scale, so it all looked normal.",3,Big Bang Theory,107,22
13761,Leonard,18, How did you know you were a giant if everything was to scale?,3,Big Bang Theory,62,13
13762,Sheldon,18, I was wearing size a million pants.,3,Big Bang Theory,36,7
13763,Leonard,18, Why don't we just talk?,3,Big Bang Theory,24,5
13764,Sheldon,18," Ah, the talking cure. Classical Freudian, good choice. If it will help speed things along, uh, my answers to the standard Rorschach ink blot test are A, a bat, B, a bat, C, a bat, and D, my father killing my mother with a hypodermic needle.",3,Big Bang Theory,241,46
13765,Leonard,18," Why don't I just start? Sometimes people have trouble accepting accolades if, on a subconscious level, they don't feel they deserve them. Do you think maybe that's what's happening here?",3,Big Bang Theory,187,30
13766,Sheldon,18," Really, Leonard? You're just going to try to recycle Adler's doctrine of the inferiority complex? I could probably get that from the woman at Ralph's. And she'd let me taste some pieces of cheese for free.",3,Big Bang Theory,206,36
13767,Leonard,18," But it could be part of your problem. Let me give you an example. When I was eight, I won a ribbon at the science fair for my project, â€œDo Lima Beans Grow Better to Classical Music.â€ù But my mother pointed out that it was just a rehash of my brother's earlier â€œDo Lima Beans Grow Worse to Rock â€˜n' Roll.â€ù I felt so guilty, I gave the ribbon back.",3,Big Bang Theory,356,70
13768,Sheldon,18, And how did that make you feel?,3,Big Bang Theory,32,7
13769,Leonard,18, Terrible. I worked really hard on that project. I stayed up all night singing the clown's aria from Pagliacci to a lima bean sprout.,3,Big Bang Theory,133,24
13770,Sheldon,18, Go on.,3,Big Bang Theory,7,2
13771,Leonard,18, It wasn't my fault. I had never seen my brother's project. And my mother could've told me before instead of at the ceremony in front of everyone.,3,Big Bang Theory,146,27
13772,Sheldon,18," So, I hear you saying you're angry with your mother.",3,Big Bang Theory,53,10
13773,Leonard,18," Damn right, I'm angry with my mother. For God's sake, I was eight years old. She humiliated me. That's when the bed-wetting started again.",3,Big Bang Theory,139,24
13774,Sheldon,18," Thank you, Leonard.",3,Big Bang Theory,20,3
13775,Leonard,18, For what?,3,Big Bang Theory,10,2
13776,Sheldon,18," If someone as damaged as you can find his way to crawl out of bed each morning, I think I can face a simple award ceremony.",3,Big Bang Theory,124,26
13777,Leonard,18," Wait, that's it? I thought we had a whole hour!",3,Big Bang Theory,48,10
13779,Leonard,18," Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Dr. Leonard Hofstadter, and it is my very great honour to introduce the winner of this year's Chancellor's award for Science and my good friend, Dr. Sheldon Cooper. But before I do, I'd like to share with you a letter from Sheldon's mother, who couldn't be here tonight. Isn't that nice? His mother sent him a letter. She's proud of him. I wonder what that feels like. Dear Shelly. That's what she calls him. Shelly, it's a pet name. You know what my mother's pet name for me is? Leonard. But I digress. Dear Shelly. I am so proud of ",3,Big Bang Theory,582,108
13780,Sheldon,18," Oh, dear.",3,Big Bang Theory,10,2
13781,Penny,18, What's the matter?,3,Big Bang Theory,19,3
13782,Sheldon,18, I'm getting dizzy.,3,Big Bang Theory,19,3
13783,Raj,18, Don't worry. You're surrounded by your C-Men.,3,Big Bang Theory,46,7
13784,Sheldon,18, I can't do this. I'm going to faint.,3,Big Bang Theory,37,8
13785,Penny,18," Here, drink this. It'll relax you.",3,Big Bang Theory,35,6
13786,Sheldon,18, Alcohol? I don't drink alcohol.,3,Big Bang Theory,32,5
13787,Penny,18," Fine, faint.",3,Big Bang Theory,13,2
13788,Sheldon,18," I don't feel different, this alcohol's defective.",3,Big Bang Theory,50,7
13789,Penny,18," Here, see if this one works.",3,Big Bang Theory,29,6
13790,Leonard,18," First of all, the projects were totally different. I was showing that classical music nurtures lima beans and makes them grow, but my mother didn't hear me. If you'd like to look at the relationship between nurturing and growth, I'd like to point out that my brother is eight inches taller than me.",3,Big Bang Theory,299,53
13791,Sheldon,18, I'm ready.,3,Big Bang Theory,11,2
13792,Leonard,18," Oh, right. Ladies and gentlemen, our guest of honour, Dr. Sheldon Cooper.",3,Big Bang Theory,74,12
13793,Sheldon,18," Thanks, shorty,I'll take it from here. All right, you people ready to have some fun? You have a basic understanding of differential calculus and at least one year of algebraic topology? Well, then here come the jokes. Why did the chicken cross the Mobius strip? To get to the same side, bazinga! All right, a neutron walks into a bar and asks, how much for a drink? The bartender says, for you, no charge. Hello? I know you're out there. I can hear you metabolizing oxygen and expelling carbon dioxide. Looks like we have some academic dignitaries in the audience. Dr. Randall from the geology department, only man who's happy when they take his work for granite. Ba-da cha! I kid the geologists, of course, but it's only 'cause I have no respect for the field. Let's get serious for a moment. Why are we all here? â€˜Cause we're scientists. And what do scientists study? The universe. And what's the universe made of? I am so glad you asked.  There's antimony, arsenic, aluminium, selenium, and hydrogen and oxygen and nitrogen and rhenium, and nickel, neodymium,",3,Big Bang Theory,1065,185
13795,Sheldon,18," Penny, Leonard. Would you be able to answer some questions I'm having about the events of last night?",3,Big Bang Theory,102,18
13796,Penny,18, Sure.,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
13797,Sheldon,18," Question one, where are my pants?",3,Big Bang Theory,34,6
13798,Leonard,18, You might want to check YouTube.,3,Big Bang Theory,33,6
13799,Sheldon,18, What do I search?,3,Big Bang Theory,18,4
13800,Leonard,18, It's already loaded. Just hit play.,3,Big Bang Theory,36,6
13802,Sheldon,18," Oh, Lord, this couldn't be any more humiliating.",3,Big Bang Theory,49,8
13803,Leonard,18," Uh-uh, give it a minute.",3,Big Bang Theory,25,5
13806,Penny,19, Having a little trouble catching your breath there?,3,Big Bang Theory,52,8
13807,Leonard,19," No, no, I'm good. If my P.E. teachers had told me this is what I was training for, I would have tried a lot harder.",3,Big Bang Theory,116,25
13808,Penny,19, Do or do not. There is no try.,3,Big Bang Theory,31,8
13809,Leonard,19, Did you just quote Star Wars?,3,Big Bang Theory,30,6
13810,Penny,19, I believe I quoted Empire Strikes Back.,3,Big Bang Theory,40,7
13811,Leonard,19," Oh, my God. I'm lying in bed with a beautiful woman who can quote Yoda. I love you, Penny.",3,Big Bang Theory,91,19
13812,Penny,19, Oh. Oh. Thank you.,3,Big Bang Theory,19,4
13813,Leonard,19, You're welcome. I just wanted to put that out there.,3,Big Bang Theory,53,10
13814,Penny,19," Oh, yeah, no, I, I'm, I'm glad.",3,Big Bang Theory,32,7
13815,Leonard,19, Good. Glad is good.,3,Big Bang Theory,20,4
13816,Penny,19," Yeah. Yeah. No, no. Um. So, it's getting pretty late. We should probably go to sleep.",3,Big Bang Theory,86,16
13817,Leonard,19, Yeah.,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
13818,Penny,19, Okay.,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
13819,Leonard,19, Yeah.,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
13820,Penny,19, Hmm.,3,Big Bang Theory,5,1
13821,Leonard,19," Yeah, probably.",3,Big Bang Theory,16,2
13822,Penny,19," Okay, good night, sweetie.",3,Big Bang Theory,27,4
13823,Leonard,19, Good night.,3,Big Bang Theory,12,2
13825,Howard,19," Hey, Leonard, where do you come down on giant ants?",3,Big Bang Theory,52,10
13826,Raj,19," Sheldon says impossible. Howard and I say not only possible, but as a mode of transportation, way cooler than a Batmobile.",3,Big Bang Theory,123,21
13827,Sheldon,19," You are ignoring the square-cube law. The giant ant would be crushed under the weight of its own exoskeleton. And for the record, the appropriate ranking of cool modes of transportation is jet pack, hoverboard, transporter, Batmobile, and then giant ant.",3,Big Bang Theory,255,41
13828,Leonard,19, Seriously? You have nothing better to do than sit around and discuss the possibility of giant ants?,3,Big Bang Theory,100,17
13829,Howard,19, What's with him?,3,Big Bang Theory,17,3
13830,Sheldon,19, Perhaps he's at a sensitive point in his monthly cycle.,3,Big Bang Theory,56,10
13831,Howard,19, Are you saying he's man-struating?,3,Big Bang Theory,35,5
13832,Sheldon,19," Not literally. But as far back as the 17th century, scientists observed a 33-day fluctuation in men's hormone levels.",3,Big Bang Theory,118,19
13833,Raj,19, Interesting. That might explain my weepy days in the middle of the month. You know what I'm talking about.,3,Big Bang Theory,107,19
13835,Howard,19," Okay, forget giant ants. How about giant rabbits?",3,Big Bang Theory,50,8
13836,Raj,19," Big or small, I don't like rabbits. They always look like they're about to say something, but they never do.",3,Big Bang Theory,109,20
13837,Sheldon,19," Rabbits do have a respiratory system that would support great size. And on a side note, they are one of the few mammals whose scrotum is in front of the penis.",3,Big Bang Theory,160,31
13838,Raj,19, Maybe that's what they want to talk about.,3,Big Bang Theory,43,8
13839,Howard,19," Leonard, where do you stand on giant rabbits and scrotal position?",3,Big Bang Theory,67,11
13840,Leonard,19, I honestly don't care.,3,Big Bang Theory,23,4
13841,Raj,19," Really? Because every time we've talked about unusual animal genitals, you've always had some pretty strong and controversial opinions.",3,Big Bang Theory,136,19
13842,Leonard,19, What do you want from me? I just don't give a rat's ass.,3,Big Bang Theory,57,13
13843,Howard,19, Would that be a giant rat's ass?,3,Big Bang Theory,33,7
13844,Sheldon,19," For the record, giant rats are possible.",3,Big Bang Theory,41,7
13845,Leonard,19, Can we please talk about something else? Maybe something vaguely related to life as we know it on this planet?,3,Big Bang Theory,111,20
13846,Howard,19," Okay, how about this for a topic, why is Leonard being a giant douche? Assuming giant douches are possible.",3,Big Bang Theory,108,19
13847,Sheldon,19, Of course they are. Leonard's being one.,3,Big Bang Theory,41,7
13848,Raj,19, Maybe he's having a lover's spat with Penny.,3,Big Bang Theory,45,8
13849,Leonard,19," No, there was no spat.",3,Big Bang Theory,23,5
13850,Howard,19," Oh, but something happened.",3,Big Bang Theory,28,4
13851,Leonard,19, I don't want to talk about it.,3,Big Bang Theory,31,7
13852,Sheldon,19, But I sense you're going to and I don't want to hear about it. Excuse me.,3,Big Bang Theory,74,16
13853,Howard,19," What'd you do, Romeo? You pour maple syrup all over your body and ask her if she was in the mood for a short stack?",3,Big Bang Theory,116,25
13854,Raj,19," Did you think it would be funny to put on a pair of her panties and jump around, but it wound up just creeping her out?",3,Big Bang Theory,120,26
13855,Leonard,19, What? No.,3,Big Bang Theory,10,2
13856,Raj,19," I'm just asking, dude. It happens.",3,Big Bang Theory,35,6
13858,Sheldon,19," Oh, yes. In fact, I've prepared some trash talk for the occasion. You bowl like your mama. Unless, of course, she bowls well. In which case, you bowl nothing like her.",3,Big Bang Theory,168,31
13860,Sheldon,19, That is what is referred to as a burn on you.,3,Big Bang Theory,46,11
13861,Howard,19, Did you ask her to start waxing?,3,Big Bang Theory,33,7
13862,Leonard,19, No.,3,Big Bang Theory,4,1
13863,Raj,19, Did you start waxing?,3,Big Bang Theory,22,4
13864,Leonard,19, No.,3,Big Bang Theory,4,1
13865,Howard,19," While making love, did you accidentally spank your own ass and cry out Mommy?",3,Big Bang Theory,78,14
13866,Leonard,19, I'm walking away from you now.,3,Big Bang Theory,31,6
13867,Howard,19, That wasn't a no.,3,Big Bang Theory,18,4
13868,Raj,19," Yeah, I think we're getting close.",3,Big Bang Theory,35,6
13870,Howard,19, Did you take a Benadryl and fall asleep while pleasuring her? Because you can die that way.,3,Big Bang Theory,92,17
13871,Raj,19," Oh, that would be a good way to go.",3,Big Bang Theory,36,9
13872,Penny,19, Hi.,3,Big Bang Theory,4,1
13873,Leonard,19," Oh, hey.",3,Big Bang Theory,9,2
13874,Sheldon,19," Good, Penny, reminder, bowling tonight at seven o'clock.",3,Big Bang Theory,57,8
13875,Penny,19," Oh, right, bowling.",3,Big Bang Theory,20,3
13876,Leonard,19, You don't have to come if you don't want to.,3,Big Bang Theory,45,10
13877,Penny,19," No, no, it's okay. I mean, let's face it, you guys would get creamed without me.",3,Big Bang Theory,81,16
13878,Sheldon,19," We would indeed. In this particular case, your lack of femininity works to our advantage.",3,Big Bang Theory,90,15
13879,Penny,19," It's always nice chatting with you, Sheldon.",3,Big Bang Theory,45,7
13880,Sheldon,19, Sarcasm?,3,Big Bang Theory,9,1
13881,Penny,19, Thinly veiled contempt.,3,Big Bang Theory,24,3
13882,Sheldon,19," Remember, seven o'clock.",3,Big Bang Theory,25,3
13883,Penny,19, Got it.,3,Big Bang Theory,8,2
13884,Sheldon,19, Pacific Daylight time!,3,Big Bang Theory,23,3
13885,Penny,19, Bite me!,3,Big Bang Theory,9,2
13886,Sheldon,19, Please reserve that butch spirit for the lanes.,3,Big Bang Theory,48,8
13888,Howard,19, I thought you were bringing your own bowling shoes.,3,Big Bang Theory,52,9
13889,Sheldon,19, These are my own bowling shoes.,3,Big Bang Theory,32,6
13890,Howard,19, Then what's with the disinfectant?,3,Big Bang Theory,35,5
13891,Sheldon,19, I know where my feet have been.,3,Big Bang Theory,32,7
13894,Sheldon,19," Well, well, well. If it isn't Wil Wheaton, the Green Goblin to my Spider-Man, the Pope Paul the fifth to my Galileo, the Internet Explorer to my Firefox.",3,Big Bang Theory,154,28
13896,Sheldon,19," I'm the proud owner of Wil Wheaton stinks dot com, dot net, and dot org. What does that tell you?",3,Big Bang Theory,98,20
13898,Sheldon,19," Oh, I'm ready. I don't know if Stuart told you what you're up against tonight, but before you stands the co-captain of the East Texas Christian Youth Holy Roller Bowling League championship team. Seven to twelve year-old division. Also, Penny's pretty good.",3,Big Bang Theory,258,42
13900,Sheldon,19," Oh, foolish Wil Wheaton, it was never off.",3,Big Bang Theory,43,8
13902,Sheldon,19," A common spare. The Miss Congeniality of the bowling pageant. Before you jump on Twitter to tout your modest accomplishment, watch how it's really done. I am the ball. My thoughts are its thoughts. Its holes are my holes.  Yes. Tweet that, Tweety Bird.",3,Big Bang Theory,253,44
13903,Howard,19," Hey, I just wanted to tell you I'm a big fan.",3,Big Bang Theory,46,11
13905,Howard,19," I'm sure you're probably sick of Star Trek questions, but, Whoopi Goldberg, you ever hit that?",3,Big Bang Theory,95,16
13906,Raj,19," Ah, beer. The magic elixir that can turn this poor, shy Indian boy into the life of the party. Oh, yeah.",3,Big Bang Theory,105,21
13907,Leonard,19, Chilli cheese fry?,3,Big Bang Theory,19,3
13908,Penny,19, Yes. I love chilli cheese fries.,3,Big Bang Theory,33,6
13909,Leonard,19, Really? You love them?,3,Big Bang Theory,23,4
13910,Penny,19," Yeah, why?",3,Big Bang Theory,11,2
13911,Leonard,19, No reason. I'm just glad to hear you're comfortable saying you love something.,3,Big Bang Theory,79,13
13912,Penny,19, Do you really want to get into this right now?,3,Big Bang Theory,47,10
13913,Leonard,19, Get into what? Why wouldn't you love the chilli cheese fries? They've been in your life a long time. They make you happy. They deserve to know.,3,Big Bang Theory,144,27
13914,Penny,19," Okay, look, you just caught me by surprise last night. I didn't know what to say.",3,Big Bang Theory,82,16
13915,Leonard,19," Okay, well, now you've had some time to think about it. So, what do you want to say?",3,Big Bang Theory,85,18
13916,Penny,19, I'm not sure.,3,Big Bang Theory,14,3
13917,Leonard,19, How can you not be sure?,3,Big Bang Theory,25,6
13918,Penny,19," Okay, this isn't the place to have this conversation.",3,Big Bang Theory,54,9
13919,Leonard,19," No, the place to have the conversation was in bed after I said, I love you, and you said, Thank you, good night.",3,Big Bang Theory,113,23
13920,Penny,19," Don't push it, Leonard.",3,Big Bang Theory,24,4
13921,Leonard,19, I am not pushing anything.,3,Big Bang Theory,27,5
13922,Penny,19, You are. You don't get to decide when I'm ready to say I love you!,3,Big Bang Theory,67,15
13923,Raj,19," Ah, the premature I love you.",3,Big Bang Theory,30,6
13924,Howard,19, I guessed premature. Does that count?,3,Big Bang Theory,38,6
13926,Sheldon,19,"  Penny,  Penny,  Penny.",3,Big Bang Theory,24,3
13927,Penny,19, What?,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
13928,Sheldon,19, This is for you.,3,Big Bang Theory,17,4
13929,Penny,19, Ice cream?,3,Big Bang Theory,11,2
13930,Sheldon,19," I've been familiarizing myself with female emotional crises by studying the comic strip Cathy. When she's upset, she says Ach and eats ice cream.",3,Big Bang Theory,146,24
13931,Penny,19," Um, Ach.",3,Big Bang Theory,9,2
13932,Sheldon,19," If you were a cat, I would have brought you a lasagna.",3,Big Bang Theory,55,12
13933,Penny,19, Did Leonard send you over here?,3,Big Bang Theory,32,6
13934,Sheldon,19," No, we haven't spoken since your abrupt departure last night caused us to forfeit to Stuart and his dastardly ringer Wil Wheaton.",3,Big Bang Theory,130,22
13935,Penny,19," Yeah, I'm sorry about that.",3,Big Bang Theory,28,5
13936,Sheldon,19, I'm not too proud to admit that I cried myself to sleep.,3,Big Bang Theory,57,12
13937,Penny,19," Again, I'm sorry.",3,Big Bang Theory,18,3
13938,Sheldon,19, And let me tell you sleep did not come easily with Leonard in the next room singing along with Alanis Morrisette.,3,Big Bang Theory,114,21
13939,Penny,19, You're kidding.,3,Big Bang Theory,16,2
13940,Sheldon,19, No. Clearly another woman in dire need of ice cream.,3,Big Bang Theory,53,10
13941,Penny,19," All right, Sheldon, what part of this is supposed to make me feel better?",3,Big Bang Theory,74,14
13942,Sheldon,19, The part where I tell you I've engineered a rematch with Stuart's team for tonight.,3,Big Bang Theory,84,15
13943,Penny,19," Oh, honey, I don't know. Things are a little weird with Leonard right now.",3,Big Bang Theory,75,14
13944,Sheldon,19," You want me to remove him from the team? I'm the captain, I can do that.",3,Big Bang Theory,73,16
13945,Penny,19," No, no, that's okay. Just let me talk to him, and I'll get back to you.",3,Big Bang Theory,72,16
13946,Sheldon,19, When are you going to talk to him?,3,Big Bang Theory,35,8
13947,Penny,19, I don't know.,3,Big Bang Theory,14,3
13948,Sheldon,19, He's in the laundry room now. Now would be a good time.,3,Big Bang Theory,56,12
13949,Penny,19," You're not gonna leave me alone until I do it, are you?",3,Big Bang Theory,56,12
13950,Sheldon,19," Oh, I think we both know the answer to that question.",3,Big Bang Theory,54,11
13952,Penny,19, I think we should talk now.,3,Big Bang Theory,28,6
13953,Leonard,19," What? No, it's okay. We don't have to talk 'cause there's nothing to talk about. Everything's good.",3,Big Bang Theory,100,17
13954,Penny,19," Really? So, you didn't get all snarky 'cause I said something nice to a bowl of chilli fries?",3,Big Bang Theory,94,18
13955,Leonard,19," All right, maybe I overreacted. So we're in two different places emotionally. So what? And maybe I'm a little ahead of you. That's fine. You know. In fact, it makes sense, 'cause let's face it, I've been in this relationship two years longer than you.",3,Big Bang Theory,252,45
13956,Penny,19," Look, Leonard, you have to know how much I care about you. It's just that I've said the L word too soon before, and it didn't work out very well.",3,Big Bang Theory,146,30
13957,Leonard,19, Really? I wouldn't know what that's like.,3,Big Bang Theory,42,7
13958,Penny,19," I'm sorry. You know what I'm talking about, though.",3,Big Bang Theory,52,9
13959,Leonard,19," Yeah, I do.",3,Big Bang Theory,12,3
13960,Penny,19," So, we're good?",3,Big Bang Theory,16,3
13961,Leonard,19," Yes, that's what I'm telling you. We are good. We are great.",3,Big Bang Theory,61,12
13962,Sheldon,19," All right! Fence mended, problem swept under the rug. Time to bowl! Yes, I was eavesdropping, there's a lot at stake here.",3,Big Bang Theory,123,22
13964,Sheldon,19," Attention, all bowlers. I've taken the liberty of having these made for our rematch.",3,Big Bang Theory,85,14
13965,Penny,19, The Wesley Crushers?,3,Big Bang Theory,21,3
13966,Sheldon,19," No, not the Wesley Crushers. The Wesley â€œCrushers.â€ù",3,Big Bang Theory,56,8
13967,Penny,19, I don't get it.,3,Big Bang Theory,16,4
13968,Leonard,19, Wesley Crusher was Wil Wheaton's character on Star Trek.,3,Big Bang Theory,57,9
13969,Penny,19, Still don't get it.,3,Big Bang Theory,20,4
13970,Sheldon,19," It's a blindingly clever play on words. By appropriating his character's name and adding the S, we imply that we we'll be the crushers of Wesley.",3,Big Bang Theory,146,26
13971,Penny,19," Okay, I'm sorry, honey, but the Wesley Crushers sounds like a bunch of people who like Wesley Crusher.",3,Big Bang Theory,103,18
13972,Sheldon,19," What? No! Again, it's not the Wesley Crushers. It's the Wesley â€œCrushers.â€ù",3,Big Bang Theory,79,12
13973,Howard,19," You know, if you want it to mean you're crushing Wesley, it'd be the â€œWesleyâ€ù Crushers.",3,Big Bang Theory,92,16
13974,Sheldon,19, Do you people even hear yourselves? It's not the Wesley Crushers. It's not the â€œWesleyâ€ù Crushers. It's the Wesley â€œCrushers.â€ù,3,Big Bang Theory,134,20
13976,Sheldon,19," No, it's not the Never mind.",3,Big Bang Theory,29,6
13978,Sheldon,19," Oh, yes. The losers will be publicly humiliated in a fashion to be chosen by the victor. FYI, I plan on having you publish a scientific paper expounding the discredited Velikovsky hypothesis.",3,Big Bang Theory,192,32
13981,Sheldon,19," Oh, yes? Well, before I respond, let me ask you a question. Is your mother a good or poor bowler?",3,Big Bang Theory,98,20
13983,Sheldon,19," No, after you, as we are currently crushing you, Wesley.",3,Big Bang Theory,57,10
13985,Sheldon,19, All right.,3,Big Bang Theory,11,2
13987,Sheldon,19, I so loathe you.,3,Big Bang Theory,17,4
13989,Sheldon,19, That's not even from your franchise!,3,Big Bang Theory,37,6
13991,Penny,19," Thank you, Stuart. It's nice to know.",3,Big Bang Theory,38,7
13993,Sheldon,19," Be the ball, Howard.",3,Big Bang Theory,21,4
13994,Howard,19," Leave me alone, Sheldon.",3,Big Bang Theory,25,4
13995,Sheldon,19, You weren't the ball.,3,Big Bang Theory,22,4
13996,Penny,19," Hey, thanks.",3,Big Bang Theory,13,2
13997,Leonard,19," This is fun, huh?",3,Big Bang Theory,18,4
13998,Penny,19, Yeah.,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
13999,Leonard,19, It's good that we got out and did something physical.,3,Big Bang Theory,54,10
14000,Penny,19, Mm-hmm.,3,Big Bang Theory,8,1
14001,Leonard,19," Gets us out of our heads. You get in your head, you start to overthink, overanalyze, obsess, you worry. That's not what we're doing tonight. Tonight we're just throwing a ball at some pins.",3,Big Bang Theory,190,34
14002,Penny,19," Yeah, that's right.",3,Big Bang Theory,20,3
14003,Leonard,19," Mm-hmm, and someday, we don't know when, maybe you'll love me back. Ooh, I'm up.",3,Big Bang Theory,81,15
14005,Sheldon,19, Excuse me. I don't know who you're chanting for as I am currently the ball.,3,Big Bang Theory,76,15
14007,Sheldon,19," Thank you, Jesus! As my mother would say.",3,Big Bang Theory,42,8
14009,Penny,19," Oh, yeah, me, too.",3,Big Bang Theory,19,4
14011,Penny,19, Tell me about it.,3,Big Bang Theory,18,4
14013,Penny,19," Oh, I'm sorry.",3,Big Bang Theory,15,3
14015,Penny,19, Really?,3,Big Bang Theory,8,1
14019,Sheldon,19, Did you let Wil Wheaton get in your head?,3,Big Bang Theory,42,9
14020,Penny,19, What are you talking about?,3,Big Bang Theory,28,5
14021,Sheldon,19, He's evil. He plays evil mind games. Did he tell you his grandmother died?,3,Big Bang Theory,75,14
14022,Penny,19, No!,3,Big Bang Theory,4,1
14023,Sheldon,19," Well, if he does, don't believe it. He's not above playing the dead meemaw card.",3,Big Bang Theory,81,15
14025,Leonard,19," Penny, you're up.",3,Big Bang Theory,18,3
14026,Sheldon,19," All right, remember, his meemaw's alive and be the ball.",3,Big Bang Theory,57,10
14027,Penny,19," Yeah, I got it.",3,Big Bang Theory,16,4
14028,Leonard,19, We really need a strike here.,3,Big Bang Theory,30,6
14029,Penny,19, I know.,3,Big Bang Theory,8,2
14030,Leonard,19, So just take your time and concentrate.,3,Big Bang Theory,40,7
14031,Penny,19," Leonard, stop pressuring me.",3,Big Bang Theory,29,4
14032,Leonard,19, I'm not pressuring you.,3,Big Bang Theory,24,4
14033,Penny,19," Yeah, you are! Just back off!",3,Big Bang Theory,30,6
14034,Leonard,19," Okay, I'm sorry. I'll shut up.",3,Big Bang Theory,31,6
14035,Penny,19, I didn't mean shut up.,3,Big Bang Theory,23,5
14036,Leonard,19," Fine. Just tell me what to do, and I'll do it.",3,Big Bang Theory,47,11
14037,Penny,19," No, this isn't fair to you, Leonard. I'm sorry.",3,Big Bang Theory,48,9
14038,Sheldon,19," Wait! Where are you going? Penny, come back! I'll get you ice cream!",3,Big Bang Theory,69,13
14039,Leonard,19," No, let her go.",3,Big Bang Theory,16,4
14040,Sheldon,19," Are you insane? If she leaves, it's over!",3,Big Bang Theory,42,8
14041,Leonard,19, I'm pretty sure it's already over.,3,Big Bang Theory,35,6
14043,Sheldon,19," You did this, didn't you?",3,Big Bang Theory,26,5
14045,Sheldon,19," No, I suppose not.",3,Big Bang Theory,19,4
14047,Sheldon,19, Wheaton!,3,Big Bang Theory,9,1
14050,Raj,19," I don't know about you, but I feel empowered.",3,Big Bang Theory,46,9
14052,Penny,20," Oh, damn, they cancelled my Visa. Oh, yay, a new MasterCard!",3,Big Bang Theory,61,11
14053,Sheldon,20, Uh-oh.,3,Big Bang Theory,7,1
14054,Penny,20, What?,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
14055,Sheldon,20, I was going to get my mail.,3,Big Bang Theory,28,7
14056,Penny,20," Okay. Are, are you hoping to get it telepathically?",3,Big Bang Theory,52,9
14057,Sheldon,20," I think you mean telekinetically. And no, I just wasn't sure of the proper protocol now that you and Leonard are no longer having coitus.",3,Big Bang Theory,138,25
14058,Penny,20," God, can we please just say no longer seeing each other?",3,Big Bang Theory,57,11
14059,Sheldon,20," Well, we could if it were true. But as you live in the same building, you see each other all the time. The variable which has changed is the coitus.",3,Big Bang Theory,149,30
14060,Penny,20," Okay, here's the protocol, you and I are still friends, and you stop saying coitus.",3,Big Bang Theory,84,15
14061,Sheldon,20," Good, good. I'm glad we're still friends.",3,Big Bang Theory,42,7
14062,Penny,20, Really?,3,Big Bang Theory,8,1
14063,Sheldon,20," Oh, yes. It was a lot of work to accommodate you in my life. I'd hate for that effort to have been in vain.",3,Big Bang Theory,108,24
14064,Penny,20, Right.,3,Big Bang Theory,7,1
14065,Sheldon,20, Just to be clear do I have to stop saying coitus with everyone or just you?,3,Big Bang Theory,76,16
14066,Penny,20, Everyone.,3,Big Bang Theory,10,1
14067,Sheldon,20," Harsh terms. But all right, I'll just substitute intercourse.",3,Big Bang Theory,62,9
14068,Penny,20, Great.,3,Big Bang Theory,7,1
14069,Sheldon,20," Or fornication. Yeah. But that has judgmental overtones, so I'll hold that in reserve.",3,Big Bang Theory,87,14
14070,Penny,20," So, how you been?",3,Big Bang Theory,18,4
14071,Sheldon,20," Well, my existence is a continuum, so I've been what I am at each point in the implied time period.",3,Big Bang Theory,100,20
14072,Penny,20," You're just coitusing with me, aren't you?",3,Big Bang Theory,43,7
14073,Sheldon,20, Bazinga.,3,Big Bang Theory,9,1
14074,Penny,20, Mmm. How's Leonard doing?,3,Big Bang Theory,26,4
14075,Sheldon,20," He seems all right. Although he does spend a disturbing amount of time looking at photographs of you and smelling the pillow you slept on. Oh, but now that I think of it, he asked me not to tell you that.",3,Big Bang Theory,205,41
14076,Penny,20, I'll pretend I didn't hear it.,3,Big Bang Theory,31,6
14077,Sheldon,20, I'd rather you pretend I didn't say it. I see you bought Mama Italia marinara spaghetti sauce.,3,Big Bang Theory,95,17
14078,Penny,20, Yep.,3,Big Bang Theory,5,1
14079,Sheldon,20," That's the sauce my mother uses. She likes cooking Italian because according to her, that's what the Romans made Jesus eat.",3,Big Bang Theory,124,21
14080,Penny,20, Interesting. I'll have to have you over for spaghetti some night.,3,Big Bang Theory,66,11
14081,Sheldon,20, I'm hungry now.,3,Big Bang Theory,16,3
14082,Penny,20," Oh. Um, okay. Why don't you give me an hour and come over?",3,Big Bang Theory,59,13
14083,Sheldon,20, Will you cut up hot dogs into little chunks and mix them in with the sauce?,3,Big Bang Theory,76,16
14084,Penny,20, I don't have hot dogs.,3,Big Bang Theory,23,5
14085,Sheldon,20," Oh, it's all right, I do. Oh! You're in for what my mother calls a real Eye-talian treat. .",3,Big Bang Theory,92,19
14086,Leonard,20," Hey, where you been?",3,Big Bang Theory,21,4
14087,Sheldon,20, I was talking with Penny.,3,Big Bang Theory,26,5
14088,Howard,20, What's wrong with you? You can't hang out with your roommate's ex. That's totally uncool.,3,Big Bang Theory,90,15
14089,Leonard,20," No, no, it's fine. I don't care. I'm over it.",3,Big Bang Theory,46,10
14090,Raj,20," Yeah, he's over it, that's why he's been whining all day about trying to invent that memory-wiper gizmo from Men in Black.",3,Big Bang Theory,123,22
14091,Sheldon,20, Is he making any progress? Because I'd like to erase Ben Affleck as Daredevil.,3,Big Bang Theory,79,14
14092,Howard,20," So would Ben Affleck. The point is, in a situation like this you got to pick sides. You're either on Team Leonard or Team Penny.",3,Big Bang Theory,129,25
14093,Sheldon,20, Which one picks last?,3,Big Bang Theory,22,4
14094,Howard,20, What?,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
14095,Sheldon,20," Well, usually I'm on the team that picks last. Unless there's a kid in a wheelchair.",3,Big Bang Theory,85,16
14096,Leonard,20," Sheldon, I got you your tangerine chicken. I hope you're hungry.",3,Big Bang Theory,65,11
14097,Sheldon,20," Well, of course I'm hungry. And as I have no plans to eat with any other team, I will consume my tangerine chicken with the appropriate gusto. Mm, mm, mm!",3,Big Bang Theory,155,30
14098,Leonard,20, Okay.,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
14099,Sheldon,20," Just out of curiosity, do we still have hot dogs?",3,Big Bang Theory,50,10
14100,Leonard,20, I don't know. Why?,3,Big Bang Theory,19,4
14101,Sheldon,20," Just making dinner conversation. Go, Team Leonard!",3,Big Bang Theory,51,7
14103,Howard,20," Oh, God, this is good.",3,Big Bang Theory,23,5
14104,Raj,20, Let me ask you a question. Do you believe you're going to go to hell for eating sweet and sour pork?,3,Big Bang Theory,101,21
14105,Howard,20, Jews don't have hell. We have acid reflux.,3,Big Bang Theory,43,8
14106,Leonard,20," Do you want the last dumpling, Sheldon?",3,Big Bang Theory,40,7
14107,Sheldon,20," Certainly. It's not like I have to moderate my food intake because I'm planning on eating again very shortly. Mm, mm, mm!",3,Big Bang Theory,122,22
14108,Leonard,20," So, you guys want to do something tonight?",3,Big Bang Theory,43,8
14109,Howard,20," Nah, I can't. I got to pick up my mom from her water aerobics class. 18 overweight women flapping their arm fat in a swimming pool. Looks like the manatee tank at Sea World.",3,Big Bang Theory,174,34
14110,Leonard,20," What about you, Raj?",3,Big Bang Theory,21,4
14111,Raj,20," Oh, there it is, now that you don't have a girlfriend, you want to hang out with me again.",3,Big Bang Theory,91,19
14112,Leonard,20, I never stopped hanging out with you.,3,Big Bang Theory,38,7
14113,Raj,20," Oh, please, we all know I'm the friend you call when you have no other options. If we were the Justice League, I'd be Aquaman.",3,Big Bang Theory,127,25
14114,Howard,20, I wish you were Aquaman. Then I could send you to scoop my mom out of the old lady tank.,3,Big Bang Theory,89,20
14115,Sheldon,20," Excuse me, I'm thirsty, so I'm going to go to the refrigerator and get myself a refreshing beverage.",3,Big Bang Theory,101,18
14116,Leonard,20, You know what? I'll just spend the evening alone.,3,Big Bang Theory,50,9
14117,Raj,20," What, suddenly I'm not good enough for you?",3,Big Bang Theory,44,8
14118,Sheldon,20," Ah, I do so love beverages. Now I think I'll take my after-dinner walk.",3,Big Bang Theory,72,14
14119,Leonard,20, Since when do you take after-dinner walks?,3,Big Bang Theory,43,7
14120,Howard,20," Yeah, since when do you take walks?",3,Big Bang Theory,36,7
14121,Sheldon,20," I read a study online that walking after a meal not only aids in digestion, but increases serotonin, and you know me, if there's one thing I like more than a refreshing beverage, it's serotonin. Bye-bye.",3,Big Bang Theory,204,36
14122,Howard,20, Hold on. I'll walk down with you.,3,Big Bang Theory,34,7
14123,Sheldon,20," Oh, that's not necessary. You can go first.",3,Big Bang Theory,44,8
14124,Howard,20, Or we could go together.,3,Big Bang Theory,25,5
14125,Sheldon,20, I can't think of a reason why not.,3,Big Bang Theory,35,8
14126,Howard,20, Let's go.,3,Big Bang Theory,10,2
14127,Sheldon,20," Hold on. Nope, no reason.",3,Big Bang Theory,26,5
14128,Raj,20, I've missed you.,3,Big Bang Theory,17,3
14130,Sheldon,20," All right, say hello to your mother for me.",3,Big Bang Theory,44,9
14131,Howard,20, Okay.,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
14132,Sheldon,20, What?,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
14133,Howard,20, You said you were going for a walk.,3,Big Bang Theory,36,8
14134,Sheldon,20, I didn't say outside.,3,Big Bang Theory,22,4
14135,Howard,20," So what, you're just gonna walk up and down the stairs?",3,Big Bang Theory,56,11
14136,Sheldon,20," No, of course not. That would be odd and suspicious behavior.",3,Big Bang Theory,62,11
14138,Howard,20, Which way are you going?,3,Big Bang Theory,25,5
14139,Sheldon,20, Which way are you going?,3,Big Bang Theory,25,5
14140,Howard,20, I parked my scooter down the block.,3,Big Bang Theory,36,7
14141,Sheldon,20, I'm going the other way. Bye.,3,Big Bang Theory,30,6
14142,Howard,20," Bye. Actually, I'm this way. Do I smell hot dogs?",3,Big Bang Theory,50,10
14143,Sheldon,20," No. I mean, I have no idea what you smell.",3,Big Bang Theory,43,10
14144,Howard,20, I definitely smell raw hot dog.,3,Big Bang Theory,32,6
14145,Sheldon,20, Perhaps you're getting a brain tumour.,3,Big Bang Theory,39,6
14146,Howard,20," All right, have a nice walk.",3,Big Bang Theory,29,6
14147,Sheldon,20, I shall. Have a nice scoot.,3,Big Bang Theory,28,6
14148,Howard,20, You might want to stand back. I'm sitting on top of 13 horses here.,3,Big Bang Theory,68,14
14149,Sheldon,20," Oh. Hello, doggie. Nice doggie. I bet you think you smell hot dogs. Look, a cat!",3,Big Bang Theory,81,16
14151,Sheldon,20,"  Penny,  Penny.  Penny.  Here. I had to trade the others for my life.",3,Big Bang Theory,70,13
14153,Raj,20," Hey, Leonard?",3,Big Bang Theory,14,2
14154,Leonard,20, Yeah?,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
14155,Raj,20, I haven't had sex in a year.,3,Big Bang Theory,29,7
14156,Leonard,20," Where you going with this, Raj?",3,Big Bang Theory,32,6
14157,Raj,20," Don't flatter yourself, dude. I want to go out and meet a woman.",3,Big Bang Theory,65,13
14158,Leonard,20," So, go.",3,Big Bang Theory,8,2
14159,Raj,20," Well, I need a wingman. I don't want to come off like a lonely loser.",3,Big Bang Theory,70,15
14160,Leonard,20, And you think my presence will help with that?,3,Big Bang Theory,47,9
14161,Raj,20," Well, I do. Next to you, I'll look like a catch.",3,Big Bang Theory,49,11
14162,Leonard,20," I'm not going out tonight, Raj.",3,Big Bang Theory,32,6
14163,Raj,20, All right. Would you mind if I went to your room and downloaded some Asian pornography?,3,Big Bang Theory,88,16
14164,Leonard,20, Very much.,3,Big Bang Theory,11,2
14165,Raj,20, Doesn't have to be Asian.,3,Big Bang Theory,26,5
14166,Leonard,20, Don't worry. You'll meet a girl someday.,3,Big Bang Theory,41,7
14167,Raj,20," No, I won't.",3,Big Bang Theory,13,3
14168,Leonard,20," Yes, you will, and she'll be beautiful, and kind and sexy and funny and everything you ever wanted in a woman.",3,Big Bang Theory,111,21
14169,Raj,20, You really think so?,3,Big Bang Theory,21,4
14170,Leonard,20," I do, and you'll fall hopelessly in love and give her your heart. And she'll take it and grind it into pathetic, little pieces.",3,Big Bang Theory,128,24
14171,Raj,20," But we'll have sex first, right?",3,Big Bang Theory,33,6
14173,Sheldon,20," Mmm, mmm, mmm. That's Eye-talian.",3,Big Bang Theory,34,5
14174,Penny,20," So, um, was Leonard okay with you coming over?",3,Big Bang Theory,47,9
14175,Sheldon,20," Oh, yes. In fact, he said, I'm fine, I don't care. And he in no way said it in a manner which would lead one to believe that he was covering up feelings of anguish and betrayal.",3,Big Bang Theory,178,37
14176,Penny,20," Well, good.",3,Big Bang Theory,12,2
14177,Sheldon,20, I'm also pleased to report that he's all cried out over you.,3,Big Bang Theory,61,12
14178,Penny,20, He's been crying?,3,Big Bang Theory,18,3
14179,Sheldon,20," Oh, I believe that was something else I wasn't supposed to mention.",3,Big Bang Theory,68,12
14180,Penny,20," Oh, God, I feel terrible.",3,Big Bang Theory,26,5
14181,Sheldon,20," Do you have a stomach ache, too?",3,Big Bang Theory,33,7
14182,Penny,20," No. Why, do you?",3,Big Bang Theory,17,4
14183,Sheldon,20, No.,3,Big Bang Theory,4,1
14184,Penny,20," Why did you ask if I had one, too?",3,Big Bang Theory,35,9
14185,Sheldon,20, Just making polite dinner conversation. Your turn.,3,Big Bang Theory,51,7
14186,Penny,20," All right. So, what's new in your life?",3,Big Bang Theory,40,8
14187,Sheldon,20," Well, my new shoes are not made for running.",3,Big Bang Theory,45,9
14188,Penny,20, Have you been running?,3,Big Bang Theory,23,4
14189,Sheldon,20," No. It's just a suspicion I have. Mmm, mmm, mmm.",3,Big Bang Theory,49,10
14190,Penny,20, I'm so glad you like it.,3,Big Bang Theory,25,6
14191,Sheldon,20, I do. Leonard never cooks for me.,3,Big Bang Theory,34,7
14192,Penny,20," Well, maybe that's 'cause Leonard can't cook.",3,Big Bang Theory,46,7
14193,Sheldon,20, You can't cook and you made me this.,3,Big Bang Theory,37,8
14194,Penny,20," Whatever. Ooh, I'm gonna get the cheesecake out of the fridge.",3,Big Bang Theory,63,11
14195,Sheldon,20," Oh, Lord, I'm in Jewish hell.",3,Big Bang Theory,30,6
14197,Raj,20, Look at this. Do you think she's really doing that or is it PhotoShop?,3,Big Bang Theory,71,14
14198,Leonard,20," I'm pretty sure Martha Stewart never got naked with a room full of big, fat Japanese guys.",3,Big Bang Theory,91,17
14199,Raj,20, You don't know that. Prison changes people.,3,Big Bang Theory,44,7
14200,Leonard,20," Hey, where you been?",3,Big Bang Theory,21,4
14201,Sheldon,20," I told you, walking.",3,Big Bang Theory,21,4
14202,Leonard,20, For an hour and a half?,3,Big Bang Theory,24,6
14203,Sheldon,20, I got lost.,3,Big Bang Theory,12,3
14204,Leonard,20, How could you get lost? Your phone has GPS.,3,Big Bang Theory,44,9
14205,Sheldon,20, Satellites are down. Solar flares.,3,Big Bang Theory,35,5
14206,Raj,20, There are no solar flares right now.,3,Big Bang Theory,37,7
14207,Sheldon,20," Yes, there are.",3,Big Bang Theory,16,3
14208,Raj,20," Dude, I'm an astrophysicist. If there were solar flares, I'd be all up in it.",3,Big Bang Theory,78,15
14209,Sheldon,20, I'm sorry. I misspoke. What I meant to say was my battery died.,3,Big Bang Theory,64,13
14210,Leonard,20, What the hell was that about?,3,Big Bang Theory,30,6
14211,Raj,20, I don't know. Do you think this is really Hillary Clinton doing it with Oprah?,3,Big Bang Theory,79,15
14212,Leonard,20," Oh, we really need to get you a girl.",3,Big Bang Theory,38,9
14214,Sheldon,20,"  Leonard,  Leonard,  Leonard.",3,Big Bang Theory,30,3
14215,Leonard,20," Oh, just come in!",3,Big Bang Theory,18,4
14216,Sheldon,20, Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.,3,Big Bang Theory,43,8
14217,Leonard,20," What do you want, Sheldon?",3,Big Bang Theory,27,5
14218,Sheldon,20, Maybe this isn't a good time.,3,Big Bang Theory,30,6
14219,Leonard,20, Tell me why you woke me up or I swear to God I will kill you.,3,Big Bang Theory,62,16
14220,Sheldon,20, Do you really think death threats are an appropriate way to begin this conversation? Sometimes your lack of social skills astonishes me.,3,Big Bang Theory,137,22
14221,Leonard,20, What do you want?,3,Big Bang Theory,18,4
14222,Sheldon,20, You may want to sit down.,3,Big Bang Theory,26,6
14223,Leonard,20, I'm in bed!,3,Big Bang Theory,12,3
14224,Sheldon,20, Point taken. You may want to sit up.,3,Big Bang Theory,37,8
14225,Leonard,20, Sheldon!,3,Big Bang Theory,9,1
14226,Sheldon,20, I've been seeing Penny behind your back.,3,Big Bang Theory,41,7
14227,Leonard,20," Okay, when you say seeing Penny, what exactly does that mean?",3,Big Bang Theory,62,11
14228,Sheldon,20," We had dinner last night. She made me spaghetti with little hot dogs cut up in it. Well, little hot dog. I gave up the other five hot dogs to a real dog. A real, big dog. A hell hound. Tangential to the primary story. How about I circle back to it?",3,Big Bang Theory,249,52
14229,Leonard,20, Fine. Why did you have dinner with Penny?,3,Big Bang Theory,42,8
14230,Sheldon,20," I told you, she made spaghetti with little hot dogs. I like spaghetti with little hot dogs.",3,Big Bang Theory,92,17
14231,Leonard,20, Then why did you have Chinese food with us?,3,Big Bang Theory,44,9
14232,Sheldon,20, I didn't want to upset you. Howard made it very clear that my allegiance should be to male comrades before women who sell their bodies for money.,3,Big Bang Theory,146,27
14233,Leonard,20, Is it possible he said Bros before Hos?,3,Big Bang Theory,40,8
14234,Sheldon,20," Yes, but I rephrased it to avoid offending the hos.",3,Big Bang Theory,52,10
14235,Leonard,20," Sheldon, I don't care if you want to be friends with Penny.",3,Big Bang Theory,60,12
14236,Sheldon,20," Oh. Well, so the emotional turmoil that's been keeping me from achieving REM sleep was entirely unjustified?",3,Big Bang Theory,109,17
14237,Leonard,20, Yes.,3,Big Bang Theory,5,1
14238,Sheldon,20," Well then as my meemaw would say, looks like we butchered a pig, but nobody wanted bacon.",3,Big Bang Theory,90,17
14239,Leonard,20, I guess not.,3,Big Bang Theory,13,3
14240,Sheldon,20," And now, as promised, the tangent. Sheldon and the Hell Hound, or How I Lost My Hot Dogs.",3,Big Bang Theory,90,18
14242,Penny,20," Oh, um, I, I can come back.",3,Big Bang Theory,28,7
14243,Leonard,20," D-don't be silly. We're neighbours, we're going to run into each other, may as well get used to it.",3,Big Bang Theory,100,19
14244,Penny,20," Yeah, I guess you're right.",3,Big Bang Theory,28,5
14245,Leonard,20, You used to it yet?,3,Big Bang Theory,20,5
14246,Penny,20, Nope.,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
14247,Leonard,20," Me neither. Oh, Sheldon seemed think that I would be upset about you hanging out with him. But I just want you to know it's fine.",3,Big Bang Theory,130,26
14248,Penny,20," Oh, oh, good, because, um, his mother called me.",3,Big Bang Theory,49,9
14249,Leonard,20, His mother?,3,Big Bang Theory,12,2
14250,Penny,20," Yeah, she wants me to take him shopping for sheets and towels.",3,Big Bang Theory,63,12
14251,Leonard,20, I was going to do that.,3,Big Bang Theory,24,6
14252,Penny,20," Oh, well, then you, you do it.",3,Big Bang Theory,31,7
14253,Leonard,20," No, I don't want to do it. You can do it.",3,Big Bang Theory,42,11
14254,Penny,20," Okay, you can take him for shoes.",3,Big Bang Theory,34,7
14255,Leonard,20, I just took him for shoes.,3,Big Bang Theory,27,6
14256,Penny,20," Well, all I know is he says they hurt his feet.",3,Big Bang Theory,48,11
14257,Leonard,20, Fine. I'll take him for shoes next Saturday.,3,Big Bang Theory,45,8
14258,Penny,20," Oh, no, no, no, a bunch of us from work are going to Disneyland next Saturday and Sheldon wants to come.",3,Big Bang Theory,105,21
14259,Leonard,20, You're taking him to Disneyland?,3,Big Bang Theory,33,5
14260,Penny,20," Well, he heard me making plans on the phone. Was I going to say no?",3,Big Bang Theory,68,15
14261,Leonard,20, All right. But let me know if you're going to stuff him with junk food. I don't want to bring home a nice dinner for him and see it go to waste.,3,Big Bang Theory,145,32
14262,Penny,20, We're going to Disneyland. He's going to eat junk food.,3,Big Bang Theory,56,10
14263,Leonard,20, All I'm saying is give me a heads-up.,3,Big Bang Theory,38,8
14264,Penny,20," Okay, whatever.",3,Big Bang Theory,16,2
14265,Leonard,20," And don't let him go on Space Mountain after he eats. He'll say he can handle it, but I promise you'll end up with churro puke on your shoes.",3,Big Bang Theory,142,29
14266,Penny,20," All right, got it. Is there anything else?",3,Big Bang Theory,43,8
14267,Leonard,20," Yeah, don't let Goofy near him. He'll have nightmares and I'll have to deal with it.",3,Big Bang Theory,85,16
14268,Penny,20, What's the problem with Goofy?,3,Big Bang Theory,31,5
14269,Leonard,20, Wish I knew. He's fine with Pluto.,3,Big Bang Theory,35,7
14271,Raj,20," Hey, do you think the elastic woman in The Incredibles needs to use birth control or can she just be a diaphragm?",3,Big Bang Theory,114,22
14272,Howard,20," Well, that's it. We're officially out of things to talk about.",3,Big Bang Theory,63,11
14273,Penny,20, We're home.,3,Big Bang Theory,12,2
14274,Leonard,20," It's ten o'clock, where have you been?",3,Big Bang Theory,39,7
14275,Sheldon,20, We stayed for the California Adventure water show. It was pure Disney magic.,3,Big Bang Theory,77,13
14276,Leonard,20, I was going to see that with him.,3,Big Bang Theory,34,8
14277,Penny,20, How was I supposed to know that?,3,Big Bang Theory,33,7
14278,Sheldon,20, It's all right. I'll see it again with you.,3,Big Bang Theory,44,9
14279,Leonard,20, And I have food here. You said you were going to call.,3,Big Bang Theory,55,12
14280,Penny,20," I know, I know.",3,Big Bang Theory,16,4
14281,Sheldon,20, I can still eat.,3,Big Bang Theory,17,4
14282,Penny,20," No, you already threw up once. Go put on your PJs and brush your teeth.",3,Big Bang Theory,72,15
14283,Sheldon,20," Okay, but just don't fight",3,Big Bang Theory,27,5
14284,Leonard,20, We're not fighting.,3,Big Bang Theory,20,3
14285,Penny,20, Just go.,3,Big Bang Theory,9,2
14286,Leonard,20, Aren't you going to thank Penny for taking you to Disneyland?,3,Big Bang Theory,62,11
14287,Sheldon,20," Thank you, Penny.",3,Big Bang Theory,18,3
14288,Penny,20," You're welcome, sweetie.",3,Big Bang Theory,25,3
14289,Leonard,20, Want a cup of coffee?,3,Big Bang Theory,22,5
14290,Penny,20," Oh, um, I should probably get going.",3,Big Bang Theory,37,7
14291,Leonard,20, Come on. It's just a cup of coffee.,3,Big Bang Theory,36,8
14292,Penny,20," Yep, okay.",3,Big Bang Theory,11,2
14293,Howard,20," Oh, yeah, the whole thing seems a little twisted to me, too.",3,Big Bang Theory,61,12
14294,Leonard,20, What am I smelling?,3,Big Bang Theory,20,4
14295,Penny,20, Sheldon's churro on my shoes.,3,Big Bang Theory,30,5
14297,Penny,20, He's such an angel when he's asleep.,3,Big Bang Theory,37,7
14298,Leonard,20, Yeah. Shame he has to wake up.,3,Big Bang Theory,31,7
14299,Penny,20, I think we can do it.,3,Big Bang Theory,22,6
14300,Leonard,20, Smother Sheldon in his sleep? Wouldn't that be wrong?,3,Big Bang Theory,54,9
14301,Penny,20," No, be friends. You and me.",3,Big Bang Theory,28,6
14302,Leonard,20, Oh. Sure. Absolutely.,3,Big Bang Theory,22,3
14303,Penny,20, Good. I'm glad.,3,Big Bang Theory,16,3
14304,Leonard,20," Here's an idea. I'm just throwing it out there, friends who have sex.",3,Big Bang Theory,70,13
14305,Penny,20," Good night, Leonard.",3,Big Bang Theory,21,3
14306,Leonard,20, Kidding. Just a couple of friends goofin' around.,3,Big Bang Theory,50,8
14307,Sheldon,20," No, Goofy, no.",3,Big Bang Theory,15,3
14309,Sheldon,21, Hold.,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
14310,Raj,21, What?,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
14311,Sheldon,21, Explain your sneeze.,3,Big Bang Theory,21,3
14312,Raj,21, I'm sorry?,3,Big Bang Theory,11,2
14313,Sheldon,21, Do you have allergies?,3,Big Bang Theory,23,4
14314,Raj,21, No.,3,Big Bang Theory,4,1
14315,Sheldon,21, Is there too much pepper on your salad?,3,Big Bang Theory,40,8
14316,Raj,21, I don't put pepper on salads.,3,Big Bang Theory,30,6
14317,Sheldon,21, I've heard enough. Sit over there.,3,Big Bang Theory,35,6
14318,Raj,21," Oh, come on. I don't want to sit by myself.",3,Big Bang Theory,44,10
14319,Sheldon,21," That's what Typhoid Mary said, and clearly, her friends buckled.",3,Big Bang Theory,65,10
14320,Raj,21," Guys, help me.",3,Big Bang Theory,15,3
14321,Howard,21," Sheldon, come on.",3,Big Bang Theory,18,3
14322,Leonard,21," Yeah, it's just one sneeze.  You're on your own.",3,Big Bang Theory,49,9
14323,Howard,21," See you, buddy.",3,Big Bang Theory,16,3
14324,Sheldon,21," Oh, Leonard, I have something for you. Per our roommate agreement, this is your 24-hour notice that I will be having a non-related female spending two nights in our apartment.",3,Big Bang Theory,176,30
14325,Leonard,21," When you say non-related female, you still mean human, right?",3,Big Bang Theory,62,10
14326,Sheldon,21," Of course. Pets are banned under the roommate agreement, with the exception of service animals, such as seeing eye dogs and, one day, cybernetically-enhanced helper monkeys.",3,Big Bang Theory,174,26
14327,Howard,21, Are you planning on kidnapping a woman?,3,Big Bang Theory,40,7
14328,Sheldon,21, Sarcasm?,3,Big Bang Theory,9,1
14329,Howard,21," Yes, but mixed with genuine concern.",3,Big Bang Theory,37,6
14330,Sheldon,21," For your information, I'll be playing host to Dr. Elizabeth Plimpton.",3,Big Bang Theory,70,11
14331,Raj,21, The cosmological physicist from Princeton?,3,Big Bang Theory,43,5
14332,Sheldon,21," Yes. And until you acquire a surgical mask, please address your comments to me through a napkin. We've been corresponding for years about our mutual interest in gravitational wave signatures of inflatons in the early universe. And now she's under consideration for a position at our university.",3,Big Bang Theory,295,47
14333,Leonard,21, Why didn't you tell me you knew Elizabeth Plimpton? I am a huge fan of hers!,3,Big Bang Theory,77,16
14334,Sheldon,21," I didn't realize I was obligated to share my connection with things you're a fan of, but very well. You enjoy Canadian bacon. I've been to Toronto.",3,Big Bang Theory,148,27
14335,Leonard,21," Okay, fine. Where is she going to sleep?",3,Big Bang Theory,41,8
14336,Sheldon,21," My room, of course.",3,Big Bang Theory,20,4
14337,Raj,21, Holy crap!  Holy crap!,3,Big Bang Theory,23,4
14338,Howard,21," Yeah, um, I have a two-part question.",3,Big Bang Theory,38,7
14339,Sheldon,21, Go ahead.,3,Big Bang Theory,10,2
14340,Howard,21," A, are you kidding me? And B, seriously, are you freaking kidding me?",3,Big Bang Theory,70,13
14341,Sheldon,21," A, I rarely kid. And B, when I do kid, you will know it by my use of the word bazinga.",3,Big Bang Theory,87,21
14342,Howard,21, So you're saying the two of you are going to be sleeping in the same bed?,3,Big Bang Theory,74,16
14343,Sheldon,21, Yes. Bazinga. Leonard?,3,Big Bang Theory,23,3
14344,Leonard,21, Thank you. Why is a world-renowned scientist staying in our apartment instead of a hotel?,3,Big Bang Theory,90,15
14345,Sheldon,21," Well, she doesn't care for hotels. And who can blame her? Windows that don't open, multi-user linens, keys shaped like credit cards, as if one walks around with unassigned slots in one's wallet. All right, I believe I have time for one more question. Yes, Raj?",3,Big Bang Theory,261,46
14346,Raj,21, When can I sit with you again?,3,Big Bang Theory,31,7
14347,Sheldon,21," When I've seen two consecutive negative throat cultures spaced 12 hours apart. You know the drill. All right, if you'll excuse me, I am off to start a prophylactic course of antibiotics.",3,Big Bang Theory,187,32
14348,Leonard,21, I can't believe he's friends with Elizabeth Plimpton.,3,Big Bang Theory,54,8
14349,Raj,21, I can't believe they let him into Canada.,3,Big Bang Theory,42,8
14350,Howard,21," Whoa, whoa, whoa. You heard the man. Where's your throat cultures? Kidding. Sit down.",3,Big Bang Theory,86,14
14352,Penny,21," Hey, Sheldon.",3,Big Bang Theory,14,2
14353,Sheldon,21," Oh, Penny, excellent. I have a question about these maxi pads. Are the wings truly functional or have I fallen victim to marketing hype?",3,Big Bang Theory,137,24
14354,Penny,21," What? What are you doing with, what?",3,Big Bang Theory,37,7
14355,Sheldon,21, The stock boy at Walgreens was frustratingly uninformed on the subject.,3,Big Bang Theory,72,11
14356,Penny,21," Sheldon, what are you doing with maxi pads?",3,Big Bang Theory,44,8
14357,Sheldon,21, I have a lady friend who will be staying with me for a few days.,3,Big Bang Theory,65,15
14358,Penny,21, Oh. What?,3,Big Bang Theory,10,2
14359,Sheldon,21," I want her to feel at home. I also bought scented soaps, pantyhose, Midol, calcium chews and what is apparently a yogurt specifically designed to regulate the female bowel.",3,Big Bang Theory,173,29
14360,Penny,21," Wait, wait, hold on, back up. You're having a woman stay with you?",3,Big Bang Theory,67,13
14361,Sheldon,21, Yes. Why does that seem to flabbergast everybody?,3,Big Bang Theory,50,8
14362,Penny,21," Oh, no, no, no, no. I'm not flabbergasted. I'm puzzled. Yeah, let's go with puzzled.",3,Big Bang Theory,85,15
14363,Sheldon,21," A word of warning. My guest is a noted physicist and the leading expert on quantum cosmology, so please try to avoid wasting her time with female jibber jabber.",3,Big Bang Theory,161,29
14364,Penny,21, Female jibber jabber?,3,Big Bang Theory,22,3
14365,Sheldon,21," Shoe sales, hair styles, mud masks, gossip about your friends Brad and Angelina.",3,Big Bang Theory,81,13
14366,Penny,21," Oh, they're not my friends.",3,Big Bang Theory,28,5
14367,Sheldon,21," I'm not surprised, considering the way you talk about them behind their backs.",3,Big Bang Theory,79,13
14369,Leonard,21," She's here, she's here. How do I look? Do I look smart?",3,Big Bang Theory,56,12
14370,Sheldon,21," Oh, good grief. This isn't about you. Coming! Now listen, one of the great minds of the 21st century is about to play host to one of the other great minds of the 21st century. So pay attention. Years from now, my biographer might ask you about this event.",3,Big Bang Theory,256,49
14371,Leonard,21," Oh, I have so many things to tell your biographer.",3,Big Bang Theory,51,10
14373,Sheldon,21, Hello.,3,Big Bang Theory,7,1
14375,Sheldon,21," I would imagine it is. This is my friend and roommate, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.",3,Big Bang Theory,79,14
14376,Leonard,21," Hi-lo. Oops. I started to say hi, and then I switched to hello in the middle. It came out hi-lo. Duh. Uh, it's nice to meet you. I've read both your books and most of your papers. I'm Leonard, I live",3,Big Bang Theory,200,41
14377,Sheldon,21, I apologize. He's only an experimental physicist.,3,Big Bang Theory,50,7
14379,Leonard,21," Are you hungry, thirsty? Can I offer you anything?",3,Big Bang Theory,51,9
14380,Sheldon,21," No, she's my guest. If anyone should offer her anything, it should be me. Elizabeth, can I get you something? Perhaps a feminine hygiene product or a bowel-regulating yogurt?",3,Big Bang Theory,175,29
14382,Sheldon,21," Excellent. If the yogurt works, I bought some delightful scented candles.",3,Big Bang Theory,74,11
14383,Leonard,21," Look, it's you.",3,Big Bang Theory,16,3
14386,Leonard,21," Well, who wants to stay in a hotel? With windows that don't open, those crazy card-shaped keys.",3,Big Bang Theory,96,17
14388,Sheldon,21," No, he doesn't understand. I understand.",3,Big Bang Theory,41,6
14389,Leonard,21," Well, I understand, too.",3,Big Bang Theory,25,4
14390,Sheldon,21, You're just misappropriating my understanding.,3,Big Bang Theory,47,5
14391,Leonard,21," Oh, . I think any university would want you. Except, of course, any university that had already had you. Because they would've already wanted you before they, you know, got you.",3,Big Bang Theory,178,31
14392,Sheldon,21, From the mind that brought you hi-lo. Let me show you to your room.,3,Big Bang Theory,68,14
14394,Leonard,21," Uh, sleep night. I mean, obviously, good night. I started to say sleep tight, then I changed my mind in the middle. I swear to God, I'm smart.",3,Big Bang Theory,143,28
14395,Sheldon,21," Get it together, man.",3,Big Bang Theory,22,4
14397,Sheldon,21," All right, let me show you some of the features of the room. First, windows. Conventional. Open, closed, open, closed, halfway open, or halfway closed, depending on your philosophical bent. Over here is my comic book collection. Feel free to browse. There's a box of disposable reading gloves on the night stand.",3,Big Bang Theory,313,52
14400,Sheldon,21," Then there's really no reason to live, is there?",3,Big Bang Theory,49,9
14402,Sheldon,21," He's an odd duck, isn't he?",3,Big Bang Theory,28,6
14404,Sheldon,21," Well, there was a misbegotten adventure with a waitress who lives across the hall. It ended as inexplicably as it began. They had very little in common, except for carnal activity. That's why I acquired these noise-cancelling headphones. If you decide to use them, please clean the ear pieces afterwards with the Wet Wipes you'll find in the bathroom. They're in the drawer labelled Wet Wipes.",3,Big Bang Theory,394,66
14406,Sheldon,21, Good. I'll leave you to your night time ablutions. I've e-mailed you the morning bathroom schedule. You'll also find a laminated copy in your welcome packet. It's on the back of the emergency escape route diagram.,3,Big Bang Theory,214,36
14408,Sheldon,21," Sleep well, my friend.",3,Big Bang Theory,23,4
14410,Sheldon,21," Oh, let me just get one thing. It's my backup emergency supply kit. The living room escape route doesn't pass through here. Now, good night. And if there's an apocalypse, good luck.",3,Big Bang Theory,182,32
14412,Leonard,21, Yes?,3,Big Bang Theory,5,1
14414,Leonard,21, Is everything all right?,3,Big Bang Theory,25,4
14416,Leonard,21," Me neither. Oh, look what I'm reading. It's you.",3,Big Bang Theory,49,9
14418,Leonard,21," I did, but it's been a while, and I wanted to sound smart over breakfast.",3,Big Bang Theory,74,15
14420,Leonard,21," Oh, good. Wasn't sure it was coming across.",3,Big Bang Theory,44,8
14422,Leonard,21," Uh, six.",3,Big Bang Theory,9,2
14424,Leonard,21, Sure.,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
14426,Leonard,21," Really? Uh, sure doesn't read that way.",3,Big Bang Theory,40,7
14428,Leonard,21, Wow. You really make science come alive.,3,Big Bang Theory,41,7
14430,Sheldon,21, Vocal test. Morning vocal test. Second vocal test. Second morning vocal test.,3,Big Bang Theory,78,12
14431,Leonard,21," Morning, Sheldon.",3,Big Bang Theory,18,2
14432,Sheldon,21, Morning.,3,Big Bang Theory,9,1
14434,Sheldon,21, Morning. I trust you had a pleasant night.,3,Big Bang Theory,43,8
14436,Sheldon,21," Excuse me, I'm going to relieve myself.",3,Big Bang Theory,40,7
14437,Leonard,21, How do you take your coffee?,3,Big Bang Theory,29,6
14439,Leonard,21, Okeydoke.,3,Big Bang Theory,10,1
14440,Sheldon,21," Pee for Houston, pee for Austin, pee for the state my heart got lost in. And shake twice for Texas.",3,Big Bang Theory,100,20
14441,Leonard,21, Something his mother taught him.,3,Big Bang Theory,33,5
14442,Sheldon,21," All right, Elizabeth, the bathroom is yours. The seat is down, and has been sanitized for your protection.",3,Big Bang Theory,107,18
14444,Sheldon,21," Ah, so the yogurt didn't work. I'll fire off a critical e-mail to the manufacturer.",3,Big Bang Theory,84,15
14445,Penny,21," Oh, good, you're up. Look, my car won't start. I need a ride to work.",3,Big Bang Theory,70,15
14446,Sheldon,21, Did you once again ignore your check engine light?,3,Big Bang Theory,51,9
14447,Penny,21," No, Mr. smarty-pants. I ignored the fill gas tank light.",3,Big Bang Theory,57,10
14448,Sheldon,21," Leonard, Penny wants to exploit any residual feelings you have for her in order to get a ride to work.",3,Big Bang Theory,103,20
14449,Leonard,21," Oh, yeah, sure, let me just put this in a travel mug.",3,Big Bang Theory,54,12
14450,Penny,21, Hello.,3,Big Bang Theory,7,1
14452,Penny,21," Oh, Penny, this is Dr. Plimpton, a leading expert on quantum cosmology. Dr. Plimpton, Penny is a waitress who doesn't understand the role gasoline plays in the internal combustion engine.",3,Big Bang Theory,188,30
14454,Penny,21," Nice to meet you, too. Are you enjoying your stay?",3,Big Bang Theory,51,10
14456,Penny,21, Good.,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
14457,Sheldon,21," Wonderful. Meaningless pleasantries accomplished. Elizabeth, Leonard's bathroom time is coming up, and believe me, you do not want to follow him.",3,Big Bang Theory,146,21
14459,Leonard,21," Okay, well, I guess I should get dressed so I can take everyone to work. You and Sheldon and Sheldon's friend, Dr. Plimpton, who you just met. It'll be fun. Like a clown car.",3,Big Bang Theory,175,34
14460,Penny,21, Hang on.,3,Big Bang Theory,9,2
14461,Leonard,21, Hmm? Yeah? What? Huh?,3,Big Bang Theory,22,4
14462,Penny,21, We just broke up.,3,Big Bang Theory,18,4
14463,Leonard,21," What, uh, you and me? Yeah, we did. Not too long ago. How are you doing with it?",3,Big Bang Theory,81,18
14464,Penny,21, Not as good as you apparently.,3,Big Bang Theory,31,6
14465,Leonard,21," I, um, I don't follow.",3,Big Bang Theory,23,5
14466,Penny,21," You know what? It's, it's none of my business. If you want to sleep with Sheldon's doctor buddy right after we stopped seeing each other, go for it.",3,Big Bang Theory,149,28
14467,Leonard,21," Well, now",3,Big Bang Theory,10,2
14468,Sheldon,21," Excuse me. I'm uncomfortable with you recommending that Leonard pursue having intercourse with Dr. Plimpton, who I assure you has better things to do.",3,Big Bang Theory,151,24
14469,Penny,21, I'm not recommending it. I'm saying it already happened.,3,Big Bang Theory,57,9
14470,Sheldon,21," That's preposterous. Tell her, Leonard.",3,Big Bang Theory,40,5
14471,Leonard,21, Well,3,Big Bang Theory,5,1
14472,Sheldon,21, No.,3,Big Bang Theory,4,1
14473,Leonard,21, Come on. It wasn't my fault.,3,Big Bang Theory,29,6
14474,Sheldon,21, The implication being that you somehow tripped and fell into her lady parts?,3,Big Bang Theory,77,13
14475,Penny,21, You know what? I'm just gonna take the bus to work.,3,Big Bang Theory,52,11
14476,Leonard,21," Penny, I can still drive you.",3,Big Bang Theory,30,6
14477,Penny,21," Oh, no, no, it's okay. You might slip on a banana peel and get me pregnant.",3,Big Bang Theory,76,16
14478,Sheldon,21," I must say, I'm shocked by this betrayal.",3,Big Bang Theory,42,8
14479,Leonard,21, I didn't betray Penny.,3,Big Bang Theory,23,4
14480,Sheldon,21," Not Penny, me!",3,Big Bang Theory,15,3
14481,Leonard,21, How am I betraying you?,3,Big Bang Theory,24,5
14482,Sheldon,21," Elizabeth's my friend, and you're playing with her!",3,Big Bang Theory,52,8
14483,Leonard,21," Yeah, I guess I did.",3,Big Bang Theory,21,5
14485,Howard,21, What the hell are you doing?,3,Big Bang Theory,29,6
14486,Raj,21," Relax, it's Nyquil.",3,Big Bang Theory,20,3
14487,Leonard,21, You still have a cold?,3,Big Bang Theory,23,5
14488,Raj,21," Maybe, but I don't care. That's the great thing about Nyquil, it's like ten-percent booze. I call it the nighttime sniffling, sneezing, coughing, so you can talk to girls medicine.",3,Big Bang Theory,181,30
14489,Leonard,21," Are you having trouble sleeping? â€˜Cause, boy, I was up all night.",3,Big Bang Theory,68,12
14490,Raj,21," Did you get a cold, too?",3,Big Bang Theory,25,6
14491,Leonard,21," No, but I was awake all night.",3,Big Bang Theory,31,7
14492,Howard,21," If you want, I can give you some of my mom's sleeping pills.",3,Big Bang Theory,61,13
14493,Raj,21, She won't notice they're missing?,3,Big Bang Theory,34,5
14494,Howard,21, She doesn't know she takes them.,3,Big Bang Theory,33,6
14495,Leonard,21," No, that's okay. It was something else keeping me up last night. And again this morning. And, I didn't mind. I was up last night. I was up this morning. I didn't mind. Those are your clues.",3,Big Bang Theory,190,37
14496,Raj,21," Ooh, ooh. Did the pigeon on your windowsill have more babies?",3,Big Bang Theory,62,11
14497,Leonard,21, No.,3,Big Bang Theory,4,1
14498,Howard,21, Were you up making another stop-motion Lego movie?,3,Big Bang Theory,51,8
14499,Leonard,21, No.,3,Big Bang Theory,4,1
14500,Howard,21," â€˜Cause let me tell you, it's not enough to make the Legos move, they also have to capture your heart.",3,Big Bang Theory,104,20
14501,Leonard,21," Okay, I'll give you one more clue. It involved another person.",3,Big Bang Theory,63,11
14502,Raj,21, Did you get a Japanese love pillow?,3,Big Bang Theory,36,7
14503,Howard,21, How is a Japanese love pillow another person?,3,Big Bang Theory,46,8
14504,Raj,21, It is if you love her and give her a name.,3,Big Bang Theory,43,11
14505,Sheldon,21," Dr. Plimpton, I'd like you to meet my colleagues, Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali",3,Big Bang Theory,74,12
14506,Raj,21, Hi.,3,Big Bang Theory,4,1
14507,Sheldon,21, And not-a-doctor Howard Wolowitz.,3,Big Bang Theory,34,4
14508,Howard,21, Hi.,3,Big Bang Theory,4,1
14509,Raj,21, I'm a big fan of your work.,3,Big Bang Theory,28,7
14511,Sheldon,21," And of course, you've already introduced yourself to Dr. Hofstadter.",3,Big Bang Theory,69,10
14512,Leonard,21," Hey, you.",3,Big Bang Theory,10,2
14514,Leonard,21," Boy, I'm kind of tuckered out. How are you feeling, Elizabeth?",3,Big Bang Theory,63,11
14516,Leonard,21," Sure. Black, right?",3,Big Bang Theory,20,3
14518,Leonard,21, Coming right up.,3,Big Bang Theory,17,3
14520,Raj,21, What?,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
14521,Howard,21, What do you mean what? It's Halo night.,3,Big Bang Theory,40,8
14522,Raj,21, I can't. I'm too sick. Go away.,3,Big Bang Theory,32,7
14523,Howard,21," That's why we moved Halo night here. Look, I brought my mom's chicken soup.",3,Big Bang Theory,76,14
14524,Raj,21, I'm not hungry.,3,Big Bang Theory,16,3
14526,Howard,21, Who's that,3,Big Bang Theory,11,2
14527,Raj,21, I bought a parrot.,3,Big Bang Theory,19,4
14528,Howard,21," Yeah, right. Dr. Plimpton?",3,Big Bang Theory,27,4
14530,Howard,21," Uh, yeah.",3,Big Bang Theory,10,2
14532,Howard,21," Yeah, sure. In fact, I'm a dungeon master.",3,Big Bang Theory,43,8
14534,Howard,21, Beg pardon?,3,Big Bang Theory,12,2
14536,Howard,21, What the frak?,3,Big Bang Theory,15,3
14537,Raj,21," Go away. She wants New Delhi, not Kosher deli. Besides, you have a girlfriend.",3,Big Bang Theory,79,14
14538,Howard,21, We broke up weeks ago.,3,Big Bang Theory,23,5
14539,Raj,21, Why didn't you say anything?,3,Big Bang Theory,29,5
14540,Howard,21, I was waiting for the right time. This is the right time.,3,Big Bang Theory,58,12
14541,Leonard,21," Hey, who's ready for Halo?",3,Big Bang Theory,27,5
14542,Raj,21," Oh, this is like a nightmare. Get lost!",3,Big Bang Theory,40,8
14543,Howard,21, He's right. The numbers are shaky enough as it is.,3,Big Bang Theory,51,10
14544,Leonard,21, I don't understand.,3,Big Bang Theory,20,3
14546,Raj,21, Good?,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
14547,Leonard,21, Elizabeth? What's going on?,3,Big Bang Theory,28,4
14549,Leonard,21, Is she suggesting what I think she's suggesting?,3,Big Bang Theory,49,8
14550,Howard,21, Yep. Welcome to the Penthouse Forum.,3,Big Bang Theory,37,6
14551,Raj,21," Okay, show of hands. Who's up for this? ",3,Big Bang Theory,41,8
14552,Leonard,21, We'll all be naked in front of each other.,3,Big Bang Theory,43,9
14553,Howard,21, I'm out.,3,Big Bang Theory,9,2
14555,Raj,21," Follow my lead. Almost. We're, we're going to go out into the hallway and, uh, make a dramatic entrance.",3,Big Bang Theory,105,19
14557,Raj,21," Run. Run, run, run. Don't look back.",3,Big Bang Theory,37,7
14558,Leonard,21, I thought we had something special.,3,Big Bang Theory,36,6
14559,Raj,21," So, you say you can't pay your rent?",3,Big Bang Theory,37,8
14561,Penny,21," Oh, Leonard?",3,Big Bang Theory,13,2
14562,Leonard,21, Hey.,3,Big Bang Theory,5,1
14563,Penny,21, I found these in the dryer. I'm assuming they belong to Sheldon.,3,Big Bang Theory,65,12
14564,Leonard,21," Thanks. It's really hard to find these in his size. So, listen. I've been meaning to talk to you about the other morning.",3,Big Bang Theory,122,23
14565,Penny,21, You mean you and Dr. Slutbunny?,3,Big Bang Theory,32,6
14566,Leonard,21," Yeah, I wanted to explain.",3,Big Bang Theory,27,5
14567,Penny,21," Well, you don't owe me an explanation.",3,Big Bang Theory,39,7
14568,Leonard,21, I don't?,3,Big Bang Theory,9,2
14569,Penny,21," No, you don't.",3,Big Bang Theory,15,3
14570,Leonard,21, So you're not judging me?,3,Big Bang Theory,26,5
14571,Penny,21," Oh, I'm judging you nine ways to Sunday, but you don't owe me an explanation.",3,Big Bang Theory,78,15
14572,Leonard,21," Nevertheless, I'd like to get one on the record so you can understand why I did what I did.",3,Big Bang Theory,92,19
14573,Penny,21, I'm listening.,3,Big Bang Theory,15,2
14574,Leonard,21, She let me.,3,Big Bang Theory,12,3
14576,Penny,22," Okay, Babydoll Pink, let's see if you can cover up the fact that I got my dad's feet.",3,Big Bang Theory,86,18
14577,Leonard,22," It's just two degrees, Sheldon. I just want to turn up the thermostat two degrees!",3,Big Bang Theory,83,15
14578,Leonard,22," Yes, if we lived in a teakettle.",3,Big Bang Theory,33,7
14579,Leonard,22," Aw, screw the roommate agreement!",3,Big Bang Theory,34,5
14580,Leonard,22," You know what, go to Hell and set their thermostat.",3,Big Bang Theory,52,10
14581,Penny,22, Who is it?,3,Big Bang Theory,11,3
14582,Leonard,22, Leonard.,3,Big Bang Theory,9,1
14583,Penny,22, Hang on.,3,Big Bang Theory,9,2
14584,Leonard,22, Can I sleep on your couch tonight?,3,Big Bang Theory,35,7
14585,Penny,22," Uh, well, you can try, but the people across the hall are being very noisy.",3,Big Bang Theory,76,15
14586,Leonard,22," You heard that, huh?",3,Big Bang Theory,21,4
14587,Penny,22," Apparently, the one fella tried to adjust the thermostat, then the other fella went bat-crap crazy.",3,Big Bang Theory,100,16
14588,Leonard,22," So you agree, he's nuts.",3,Big Bang Theory,25,5
14589,Penny,22," Well, not as nuts as the guy who chooses to live with him.",3,Big Bang Theory,59,13
14590,Leonard,22," Believe it or not, he was worse when I met him.",3,Big Bang Theory,48,11
14591,Penny,22," Oh, I do not believe that.",3,Big Bang Theory,27,6
14598,Leonard,22, That should have been my first clue.,3,Big Bang Theory,37,7
14600,Penny,22, So Sheldon's last roommate tried to warn you off?,3,Big Bang Theory,50,9
14601,Leonard,22," For all I knew, he was the crazy one. He had this really deranged look.",3,Big Bang Theory,72,15
14602,Penny,22," Well, yeah, he'd been living with Sheldon.",3,Big Bang Theory,43,7
14603,Leonard,22," Sure, it makes sense now. . Anyway, I went upstairs and knocked on the door.",3,Big Bang Theory,77,15
14607,Leonard,22," In retrospect, that was clue number two.",3,Big Bang Theory,41,7
14665,Penny,22," Okay, and after all that, you just moved in?",3,Big Bang Theory,45,9
14673,Penny,22, Why on earth did you agree to all that?,3,Big Bang Theory,40,9
14674,Leonard,22," It was the best apartment I'd seen, the rent was very reasonable and after you've passed the first three barriers you kind of want to take it all the way.",3,Big Bang Theory,155,30
14675,Penny,22," Well, I'm sorry, Leonard, it's very hard to feel sympathy for you.",3,Big Bang Theory,67,12
14676,Leonard,22," Okay, how about this? Let me tell you about the first time I brought a girl over. ",3,Big Bang Theory,83,17
14688,Penny,22," Oh, my God.",3,Big Bang Theory,12,3
14689,Leonard,22, Do I get some sympathy now?,3,Big Bang Theory,28,6
14690,Penny,22," A little bit. Okay. Let me get this straight. You move in with this guy, he makes you sign a ridiculous roommate agreement, then he walks into your bedroom while you're doing this Joyce Kim, and you still stay?",3,Big Bang Theory,211,39
14691,Leonard,22," Actually, I couldn't get too mad at him about Joyce Kim.",3,Big Bang Theory,57,11
14692,Penny,22, Why not?,3,Big Bang Theory,9,2
14693,Leonard,22," Well, I was doing some government research at the time, you know, military, rocket fuel. It's kind of secret.",3,Big Bang Theory,110,19
14694,Penny,22, What does that have to do with Joyce Kim?,3,Big Bang Theory,42,9
14695,Leonard,22," As it turns out, she was a North Korean spy. Luckily, Sheldon drove her out before I revealed anything important. Which I'm not saying I would have.",3,Big Bang Theory,149,27
14696,Penny,22," So, what, that's it? You've stayed with Sheldon all this time because he kept you from going to federal prison?",3,Big Bang Theory,112,20
14697,Leonard,22, That was part of it. The other part is what happened with the elevator.,3,Big Bang Theory,72,14
14698,Penny,22," Oh, yeah, I'm wondering about that. You said it was working when you moved in.",3,Big Bang Theory,79,15
14699,Leonard,22," It was, but one night, Sheldon came home from work ",3,Big Bang Theory,52,10
14722,Penny,22," Okay, what does all this have to do with the elevator?",3,Big Bang Theory,55,11
14723,Leonard,22, I'm getting to it. ,3,Big Bang Theory,20,4
14756,Penny,22," Okay, how do you know he said that? You left the room.",3,Big Bang Theory,55,12
14757,Leonard,22," Hey, do you want me to finish working on your man feet or not?",3,Big Bang Theory,63,14
14758,Penny,22, Fine. Go ahead. ,3,Big Bang Theory,17,3
14772,Penny,22," So, why was it his lucky day?",3,Big Bang Theory,30,7
14773,Leonard,22," Well, it turns out I had a little rocket fuel in the apartment.",3,Big Bang Theory,64,13
14774,Penny,22, What were you doing with rocket fuel in your apartment?,3,Big Bang Theory,56,10
14775,Leonard,22," Mm, Joyce Kim was kind of curious about what I did for a living, and I was going to kind of show it to her. It's not important. The point is, the guys and I went back to the apartment.",3,Big Bang Theory,185,40
14776,Penny,22, Are we ever going to get to the elevator?,3,Big Bang Theory,42,9
14777,Leonard,22," Yeah, we're really close. Uh, uh, we're at the apartment. ",3,Big Bang Theory,59,10
14797,Leonard,22," Not only did Sheldon save my life, he didn't rat me out to the landlord. Or the police. Or Homeland Security.",3,Big Bang Theory,110,21
14798,Penny,22," Okay, so, basically, you're the reason I have to walk up and down three flights of stairs every day?",3,Big Bang Theory,101,19
14799,Leonard,22, So I did something stupid. I'm sure you did stupid things when you were younger. What were you doing seven years ago?,3,Big Bang Theory,118,22
14800,Penny,22," Excuse me, I was in high school. Studying, keeping my nose clean, doing volunteer work for the community. ",3,Big Bang Theory,107,18
14803,Sheldon,22," Oh, Ubuntu, you are my favourite Linux-based operating system.",3,Big Bang Theory,63,9
14804,Leonard,22, Hey.,3,Big Bang Theory,5,1
14805,Sheldon,22, Hello. Why do I smell methacrylate?,3,Big Bang Theory,36,6
14806,Leonard,22," Oh, uh, clear nail polish. I had a mani-pedi. Men can get those. Anyway, I may owe you an apology.",3,Big Bang Theory,99,20
14807,Sheldon,22, There's doubt?,3,Big Bang Theory,15,2
14808,Leonard,22," I did agree to the thermostat setting, and I shouldn't have tried to change it.",3,Big Bang Theory,80,15
14809,Sheldon,22," That's not an apology, simply an acknowledgement that I was right.",3,Big Bang Theory,67,11
14810,Leonard,22," Okay, I'm sorry.",3,Big Bang Theory,17,3
14811,Sheldon,22, There you go.,3,Big Bang Theory,14,3
14812,Leonard,22," So, we're good?",3,Big Bang Theory,16,3
14813,Sheldon,22, Good what?,3,Big Bang Theory,11,2
14814,Leonard,22, Never mind. Okay if I watch some TV?,3,Big Bang Theory,37,8
14815,Sheldon,22, Go ahead.,3,Big Bang Theory,10,2
14818,Leonard,22, You're not even watching!,3,Big Bang Theory,26,4
14819,Sheldon,22, I can hear it!,3,Big Bang Theory,15,4
14820,Leonard,22," Oh, so the dialogue offends you?",3,Big Bang Theory,33,6
14821,Sheldon,22, I would hardly call that dialogue!,3,Big Bang Theory,35,6
14822,Leonard,22," You're insane, you know that?!",3,Big Bang Theory,31,5
14823,Sheldon,22," Don't make me turn that flag upside down, 'cause you know I'll do it!",3,Big Bang Theory,70,14
14825,Leonard,23," Okay, we've got power to the laser.",3,Big Bang Theory,36,7
14826,Sheldon,23, I should've brought an umbrella.,3,Big Bang Theory,33,5
14827,Leonard,23, What for? It's not going to rain.,3,Big Bang Theory,34,7
14828,Sheldon,23," I know that, but with skin as fair as mine, moon burn is a real possibility.",3,Big Bang Theory,77,16
14829,Howard,23," That's a bazinga, right?",3,Big Bang Theory,25,4
14830,Sheldon,23," One of my best, don't you think?",3,Big Bang Theory,33,7
14831,Leonard,23," Howard, do you want to double-check the equatorial mount on the laser? We need it locked onto the Sea of Tranquility.",3,Big Bang Theory,118,21
14832,Howard,23," You got it. Oh, Raj, no. Billions of dollars have gone into inventing the Internet and filling it with pictures of naked women, so we don't have to peep through windows.",3,Big Bang Theory,170,31
14833,Raj,23," It's not like that, I'm watching someone's TV. The Good Wife is on. I tell you, this is my new Grey's Anatomy.",3,Big Bang Theory,111,22
14834,Sheldon,23," Leonard, Leonard. What is that? What is that?",3,Big Bang Theory,46,8
14835,Leonard,23," Relax, it's just a dirty sock.",3,Big Bang Theory,31,6
14836,Sheldon,23, How on earth can you say dirty sock and relax in the same sentence?,3,Big Bang Theory,68,14
14837,Leonard,23," Sheldon, the world is filled with dirty discarded socks.",3,Big Bang Theory,57,9
14838,Sheldon,23, Not my world.,3,Big Bang Theory,14,3
14839,Leonard,23," Hey, you know who'd really dig seeing this experiment? Penny.",3,Big Bang Theory,62,10
14840,Sheldon,23," I wasn't aware that lunar ranging was her thing. Although, I suppose the retro-reflector left on the moon by Neil Armstrong does qualify as a shiny object.",3,Big Bang Theory,156,27
14841,Raj,23, Why don't you ask her to come up?,3,Big Bang Theory,34,8
14842,Leonard,23," I don't know, it's still a little weird since, you know",3,Big Bang Theory,56,11
14843,Howard,23, She dumped you?,3,Big Bang Theory,16,3
14844,Leonard,23, She didn't dump me. We were just in different places in the relationship.,3,Big Bang Theory,74,13
14845,Sheldon,23, I fail to see how a relationship can have the qualities of a geographic location.,3,Big Bang Theory,82,15
14846,Howard,23," Oh, it's very simple. Leonard was living in a little town called please don't leave me, while Penny had just moved to the island of bye-bye.",3,Big Bang Theory,141,26
14847,Leonard,23, Screw you guys. I'm gonna go see if she's home.,3,Big Bang Theory,48,10
14848,Howard,23," If it's not too much trouble, I'd like to point this at the moon now.",3,Big Bang Theory,70,15
14849,Raj,23," Wait a second, the good wife is crying. Something's very wrong.",3,Big Bang Theory,64,11
14851,Penny,23," Oh, hi. What's going on?",3,Big Bang Theory,25,5
14852,Leonard,23, We're up on the roof bouncing laser beams off the moon.,3,Big Bang Theory,56,11
14853,Penny,23," I'm sorry, what?",3,Big Bang Theory,17,3
14854,Leonard,23, It's pretty cool. We've got a two-meter parabolic reflector and everything. I thought you might want to see it.,3,Big Bang Theory,112,19
14856,Penny,23, Um,3,Big Bang Theory,3,1
14858,Penny,23," Uh, Leonard, this is Zack. Zack, Leonard.",3,Big Bang Theory,42,7
14860,Leonard,23," Oh, sorry, I didn't know you were busy. Maybe another time.",3,Big Bang Theory,60,11
14861,Penny,23," Yeah, maybe.",3,Big Bang Theory,13,2
14863,Penny,23," Oh, but what about the party?",3,Big Bang Theory,30,6
14865,Penny,23," Oh, right.",3,Big Bang Theory,11,2
14866,Leonard,23," Okay, well, yeah, come on up. So, how'd you two guys meet?",3,Big Bang Theory,59,12
14868,Leonard,23, Your company?,3,Big Bang Theory,14,2
14870,Leonard,23," So, menus.",3,Big Bang Theory,11,2
14873,Howard,23, Happy now? I'm moving the dirty sock.,3,Big Bang Theory,38,7
14874,Sheldon,23," Thank you. Raj, keep an eye out for the other one.",3,Big Bang Theory,51,11
14875,Penny,23," Hey, guys, this is my friend Zack.",3,Big Bang Theory,35,7
14877,Sheldon,23, Hello.,3,Big Bang Theory,7,1
14879,Sheldon,23," Yes. In 1917, when Albert Einstein established the theoretic foundation for the laser in his paper Zur Quantentheorie der Strahlung, his fondest hope was that the resultant device be bitchin'.",3,Big Bang Theory,193,30
14881,Leonard,23," Let me explain what we're doing here. Um, in 1969, the astronauts on Apollo 11 positioned reflectors on the surface of the moon, and we're going to shoot a laser off one of them and let the light bounce back into this photomultiplier.",3,Big Bang Theory,235,43
14882,Penny,23, Oh! That's very cool.,3,Big Bang Theory,22,4
14884,Leonard,23, The laser?,3,Big Bang Theory,11,2
14886,Sheldon,23," See, now this is a man for Penny.",3,Big Bang Theory,34,8
14887,Leonard,23," Uh, that's a great question, Zack.",3,Big Bang Theory,35,6
14888,Sheldon,23," No, it's not.",3,Big Bang Theory,14,3
14889,Penny,23, Sheldon! Play nice.,3,Big Bang Theory,20,3
14890,Sheldon,23, Well it's not a great question. How could somebody possibly think we're going to blow up the moon? That's a great question.,3,Big Bang Theory,124,22
14891,Leonard,23," Don't worry about the moon. We, we set our laser to stun.",3,Big Bang Theory,58,12
14893,Leonard,23," Now, we'll be able to see the beam when it leaves, but it won't be strong enough when it comes back to be seen by the naked eye.",3,Big Bang Theory,129,28
14895,Leonard,23," Right. Uh yeah, funny. Uh, that device there will measure the photons that return and let us see it on this computer. Raj, get them some glasses.",3,Big Bang Theory,146,27
14897,Howard,23, Preparing to fire laser at the moon.,3,Big Bang Theory,37,7
14898,Sheldon,23, Make it so.,3,Big Bang Theory,12,3
14899,Howard,23, There it is. There's the spike!,3,Big Bang Theory,32,6
14900,Leonard,23, 2.5 seconds for the light to return. That's the moon! We hit the moon!,3,Big Bang Theory,71,14
14902,Leonard,23," Yeah, but, uh, think about what this represents. The fact that we can do this is the only way of definitively proving that there are man-made objects on the moon, put there by a member of a species that only 60 years before had just invented the airplane.",3,Big Bang Theory,256,48
14904,Sheldon,23, I was wrong. Penny can do better.,3,Big Bang Theory,34,7
14905,Penny,23," Okay, guys, thank you, it's been fun.",3,Big Bang Theory,38,7
14907,Penny,23," No, just keep walking.",3,Big Bang Theory,23,4
14908,Sheldon,23, He must be very skilled at coitus.,3,Big Bang Theory,35,7
14910,Raj,23," I'm telling you, dude, the only way to feel better about Penny going out with other guys is for you to get back on the whores.",3,Big Bang Theory,127,26
14911,Howard,23, Horse.,3,Big Bang Theory,7,1
14912,Raj,23, What?,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
14913,Howard,23," The phrase is get back on the horse, not whores.",3,Big Bang Theory,49,10
14914,Raj,23," That's disgusting, dude.",3,Big Bang Theory,25,3
14915,Howard,23," No, it's not Never mind. He is right, though. If you want, I can turn you on to this great new dating site I found.",3,Big Bang Theory,116,25
14916,Leonard,23," No, thanks.",3,Big Bang Theory,12,2
14917,Howard,23, You sure? They say they can find a match for anybody.,3,Big Bang Theory,54,11
14918,Leonard,23, Have they found a match for you?,3,Big Bang Theory,33,7
14919,Howard,23," Tons. I've had, like, eight dates in the last month. And twelve if you count the ones who showed up and left.",3,Big Bang Theory,110,22
14920,Sheldon,23, I can't bring the nitrogen tank down.,3,Big Bang Theory,38,7
14921,Leonard,23, Why not?,3,Big Bang Theory,9,2
14922,Sheldon,23," All right, let me restate that. It's very heavy, and I don't want to.",3,Big Bang Theory,70,14
14923,Leonard,23, I'll help you.,3,Big Bang Theory,15,3
14924,Sheldon,23," Thank you. Lift with your knees, not your back. Good night.",3,Big Bang Theory,60,11
14925,Raj,23, You know what would be fun? Signing Sheldon up for online dating.,3,Big Bang Theory,66,12
14926,Howard,23," Yeah, right.",3,Big Bang Theory,13,2
14927,Raj,23," No, think about it. We make it an experiment. Like when Frankenstein's monster was lonely and he found a wife.",3,Big Bang Theory,111,20
14928,Howard,23, He didn't find a wife. They built him a wife out of dead body parts.,3,Big Bang Theory,69,15
14929,Raj,23," Okay, we'll call that plan B.",3,Big Bang Theory,30,6
14931,Leonard,23, Coming!,3,Big Bang Theory,8,1
14932,Penny,23," Damn you, you rat bastard.",3,Big Bang Theory,27,5
14933,Leonard,23, Are you drunk?,3,Big Bang Theory,15,3
14934,Penny,23," Zack was a perfectly nice guy, and then you ruined him!",3,Big Bang Theory,56,11
14935,Leonard,23, How did I ruin him?,3,Big Bang Theory,20,5
14936,Penny,23," â€˜Cause in the olden days, I never would've known he was so stupid.",3,Big Bang Theory,69,13
14937,Leonard,23," Come on, he wasn't that stupid.",3,Big Bang Theory,32,6
14938,Penny,23," Yes, he was! He thought you were gonna blow up the moon!",3,Big Bang Theory,57,12
14939,Leonard,23," Okay, yeah, he's stupid.",3,Big Bang Theory,25,4
14940,Penny,23, He spent the entire night bragging about how he invented the word appe-teasers.,3,Big Bang Theory,80,13
14941,Leonard,23, How is that my fault?,3,Big Bang Theory,22,5
14942,Penny,23," You have destroyed my ability to tolerate idiots. Now, come with me.",3,Big Bang Theory,69,12
14943,Leonard,23, Where are we going?,3,Big Bang Theory,20,4
14944,Penny,23, We're gonna have sex.,3,Big Bang Theory,22,4
14945,Leonard,23," Why? I mean, okay.",3,Big Bang Theory,19,4
14946,Sheldon,23, What's going on?,3,Big Bang Theory,17,3
14947,Penny,23," Put on your noise-cancelling headphones, 'cause it's gonna get loud.",3,Big Bang Theory,69,10
14948,Sheldon,23, Oh! Not this again.,3,Big Bang Theory,20,4
14950,Sheldon,23," In what universe is this low-pulp? Good morning, Penny.",3,Big Bang Theory,56,9
14951,Penny,23," What, do you have eyes in the back of your head?",3,Big Bang Theory,49,11
14952,Sheldon,23," When one gets beaten up every other day in school, one of necessity develops a keen sense of hearing. Incidentally, one can get beaten up in school simply by referring to oneself as one. I'm making English muffins. Would you like an English muffin?",3,Big Bang Theory,249,44
14953,Penny,23," Oh, thanks, I'm not hungry.",3,Big Bang Theory,28,5
14954,Sheldon,23," FYI, my noise-cancelling headphones proved ineffective last night.",3,Big Bang Theory,67,8
14955,Penny,23," Yeah, sorry about that.",3,Big Bang Theory,24,4
14956,Sheldon,23," As a native Texan, I must say I've never heard the phrase yee-haw used in quite that context.",3,Big Bang Theory,94,18
14957,Penny,23," Oh, God.",3,Big Bang Theory,9,2
14958,Sheldon,23," Oh, God. That I've heard on multiple occasions. In what universe is that lightly toasted? This has to be the worst day of my life. Good morning, Leonard.",3,Big Bang Theory,154,28
14959,Leonard,23, How many times have I asked you not to do that?,3,Big Bang Theory,48,11
14960,Sheldon,23, Counting this instance? 317.,3,Big Bang Theory,29,4
14961,Leonard,23, Where's Penny?,3,Big Bang Theory,15,2
14962,Sheldon,23, She returned to her apartment. I presume to shower and vomit. Not necessarily in that order.,3,Big Bang Theory,93,16
14963,Leonard,23, I wonder why she didn't say good-bye.,3,Big Bang Theory,38,7
14964,Sheldon,23, Are you expecting me to offer an explanation of human behaviour?,3,Big Bang Theory,65,11
14965,Leonard,23," I know. I just thought as an outsider, you might be able to provide a fresh perspective.",3,Big Bang Theory,89,17
14966,Sheldon,23, I have no difficulty believing you're not butter.,3,Big Bang Theory,50,8
14968,Leonard,23," Oh, hey.",3,Big Bang Theory,9,2
14969,Penny,23," Oh, hi. Um, I gotta run. Early shift.",3,Big Bang Theory,38,8
14970,Leonard,23," Okay, I'll walk down with you. So, last night was fun, huh?",3,Big Bang Theory,60,12
14971,Penny,23," Yeah, it must have been. I just threw up in my closet.",3,Big Bang Theory,55,12
14972,Leonard,23," Bummer. Anyway, I was thinking tonight maybe we could catch a movie.",3,Big Bang Theory,69,12
14973,Penny,23," Oh, yeah, tonight's not great for me.",3,Big Bang Theory,38,7
14974,Leonard,23, Doesn't have to be tonight. I'm free pretty much always.,3,Big Bang Theory,57,10
14975,Penny,23," Leonard, last night was a mistake.",3,Big Bang Theory,35,6
14976,Leonard,23," When you say mistake, do you mean a fortunate mistake, like the discovery of penicillin?",3,Big Bang Theory,89,15
14977,Penny,23," Look, I'm sorry. I was drunk, I was lonely, I hated Zack. Can we just forget it ever happened?",3,Big Bang Theory,95,19
14978,Leonard,23," No, it's pretty well imprinted on my brain. Especially the whole rodeo thing.",3,Big Bang Theory,78,13
14979,Penny,23," Oh, God!",3,Big Bang Theory,9,2
14980,Leonard,23," So, that's it? Wham, bam, thank you, Leonard?",3,Big Bang Theory,46,8
14981,Penny,23," Look, I said I'm sorry. Can't u please let it go?",3,Big Bang Theory,50,11
14982,Leonard,23," How am I supposed to let it go? You used me for sex! Morning, Mrs. Gunderson.",3,Big Bang Theory,78,16
14985,Raj,23, Holy crap.,3,Big Bang Theory,11,2
14986,Howard,23, What?,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
14987,Raj,23, We finally have proof that aliens walk among us.,3,Big Bang Theory,49,9
14988,Howard,23, Excuse me?,3,Big Bang Theory,11,2
14989,Raj,23, The dating site matched a woman with Sheldon.,3,Big Bang Theory,46,8
14990,Howard,23, You're kidding. An actual woman?,3,Big Bang Theory,33,5
14991,Raj,23," Yeah, look. Breasts and everything.",3,Big Bang Theory,36,5
14992,Howard,23," Trust me, breasts doesn't necessarily mean woman.",3,Big Bang Theory,50,7
14993,Raj,23, Since when?,3,Big Bang Theory,12,2
14994,Howard,23," I'll show you a picture of my Uncle Louie in a bathing suit sometime. Leonard, you gotta see this, we found a match for Sheldon.",3,Big Bang Theory,129,25
14995,Leonard,23," Great. Maybe she can have sex with him, and then walk out on him the next morning without so much as a how do you do?",3,Big Bang Theory,118,26
14996,Raj,23, Do you know what he's talking about?,3,Big Bang Theory,37,7
14997,Howard,23, Nope. Why don't you ask him?,3,Big Bang Theory,29,6
14998,Raj,23," Leonard, what are you talking about?",3,Big Bang Theory,37,6
14999,Leonard,23, I don't want to talk about it.,3,Big Bang Theory,31,7
15000,Raj,23, That was a lousy suggestion.,3,Big Bang Theory,29,5
15001,Howard,23," Whatever. Right now, Dr. Sheldon Cooper has to send an e-mail to his perfect match. Greetings, fellow life-form",3,Big Bang Theory,112,18
15003,Leonard,23," If she can do it, I can do it. If she can do it, I can do it. If she can do it, I can do it.  I can't do it.",3,Big Bang Theory,109,31
15005,Leonard,23," Oh, hi. Hey. Hi, Leslie.",3,Big Bang Theory,25,5
15007,Leonard,23," Uh, I know! It's been a while!",3,Big Bang Theory,31,7
15009,Leonard,23, Right. Right. So how you doing?,3,Big Bang Theory,32,6
15011,Leonard,23," Uh, not bad. You remember when we used to have sex and you said that it didn't mean anything, it was just for fun?",3,Big Bang Theory,115,24
15013,Leonard,23," Uh, do you, uh, want to do that again?",3,Big Bang Theory,39,9
15015,Leonard,23, She didn't dump me. We were just in different places in the relationship.,3,Big Bang Theory,74,13
15017,Leonard,23," Um, anyway, apparently, it's okay to go back to people you're no longer seeing and have recreational sex with them.",3,Big Bang Theory,116,20
15019,Leonard,23," So, what do you say?",3,Big Bang Theory,21,5
15021,Leonard,23, She's not coming back.,3,Big Bang Theory,23,4
15023,Raj,23, Uh-oh. She wants to meet us.,3,Big Bang Theory,29,6
15024,Howard,23, Not us. Him.,3,Big Bang Theory,13,3
15025,Raj,23," Yes, but him doesn't even know about her.",3,Big Bang Theory,42,8
15026,Howard,23," Well, him about to find out about her.",3,Big Bang Theory,39,8
15027,Raj,23, Really? Us gonna tell him?,3,Big Bang Theory,27,5
15028,Sheldon,23, Who's going to tell whom about what?,3,Big Bang Theory,37,7
15029,Howard,23, Sheldon. Hey.,3,Big Bang Theory,14,2
15030,Raj,23, Hi.,3,Big Bang Theory,4,1
15031,Sheldon,23, Your surprise confuses me. I live here.,3,Big Bang Theory,40,7
15032,Howard,23," Right. So, listen, what are you doing tomorrow afternoon?",3,Big Bang Theory,58,9
15033,Sheldon,23, Be more specific.,3,Big Bang Theory,18,3
15034,Howard,23, Four thirty.,3,Big Bang Theory,13,2
15035,Sheldon,23, That's not afternoon. That's preevning.,3,Big Bang Theory,40,5
15036,Howard,23, What?,3,Big Bang Theory,6,1
15037,Sheldon,23, It's a time of day I invented. It better defines the ambiguous period between afternoon and evening. Preevning. I'm fairly certain it will catch on as it fills a desperate need.,3,Big Bang Theory,178,31
15038,Raj,23," Right, okay. What are you doing tomorrow preevning?",3,Big Bang Theory,52,8
15039,Sheldon,23," Well, tomorrow's Saturday. Saturday night is laundry night, so I'll be spending the preevning pre-sorting and pre-soaking.",3,Big Bang Theory,123,17
15040,Sheldon,23," I would snort in derision and throw my arms in the air, exhausted by your constant tomfoolery.",3,Big Bang Theory,95,17
15041,Raj,23," But it's true. But we-we put all your vital information into this dating site, answered all their questions just like you would, and they found a match for you. Her name is Amy Farrah Fowler.",3,Big Bang Theory,192,35
15042,Sheldon,23," Please. Even assuming you could answer any question the way I would, the algorithms used by matchmaking sites are complete hokum.",3,Big Bang Theory,130,21
15043,Howard,23," And that's exactly the answer we gave to the question, what is your attitude towards online datingâ€ù",3,Big Bang Theory,102,17
15044,Raj,23," Howard wanted to write mumbo jumbo, but I said no, our Sheldon would say hokum.",3,Big Bang Theory,80,15
15045,Howard,23," Well, come on, where's your scientific curiosity?",3,Big Bang Theory,50,7
15046,Sheldon,23," Well, most of it is being applied to unravelling the secrets of the universe while the rest of it's wondering why I'm having this conversation with you.",3,Big Bang Theory,153,27
15047,Raj,23," Okay, how about this. Even Spock had a date once every seven years.",3,Big Bang Theory,68,13
15048,Sheldon,23, He didn't date. It was pon farr. His blood boiled with mating lust.,3,Big Bang Theory,68,13
15049,Howard,23," Okay, well, why don't you start with a cup of coffee, and you can pon farr Amy Farrah Fowler later.",3,Big Bang Theory,100,20
15050,Sheldon,23, I don't drink coffee.,3,Big Bang Theory,22,4
15051,Howard,23," All right, you can have a hot chocolate.",3,Big Bang Theory,41,8
15052,Sheldon,23," As I will not be engaging in this nonsense, my choice of beverage is moot. But for the record, I only drink hot chocolate in months with an R in them.",3,Big Bang Theory,151,31
15053,Howard,23, Why?,3,Big Bang Theory,5,1
15054,Sheldon,23, What's life without whimsy?,3,Big Bang Theory,28,4
15055,Howard,23," Okay, I'm out.",3,Big Bang Theory,15,3
15056,Raj,23," Sheldon, I've hidden the dirty sock from the roof somewhere in your apartment. Unless you are willing to come with us to meet this girl, it will remain there forever.",3,Big Bang Theory,167,30
15057,Sheldon,23, You're bluffing.,3,Big Bang Theory,17,2
15058,Raj,23, Are you willing to risk it?,3,Big Bang Theory,28,6
15059,Sheldon,23, Curse you.,3,Big Bang Theory,11,2
15061,Leonard,23, Thirty feet.,3,Big Bang Theory,13,2
15062,Penny,23," Oh. Hey, Leonard.",3,Big Bang Theory,18,3
15063,Leonard,23," I was a perfectly happy, geeky, little lonely guy, and you ruined me!",3,Big Bang Theory,70,13
15064,Penny,23, Are you drunk?,3,Big Bang Theory,15,3
15065,Leonard,23," Come on. We're gonna have sex, and it's not gonna mean a thing!",3,Big Bang Theory,64,13
15066,Penny,23, Are you out of your mind?!,3,Big Bang Theory,27,6
15067,Leonard,23, I'm really starting to think there's a double standard here.,3,Big Bang Theory,61,10
15069,Sheldon,23," In a few minutes, when I gloat over the failure of this enterprise, how would you prefer I do it? The standard I told you so? The classic neener-neener? Or just my normal look of haughty derision?",3,Big Bang Theory,197,37
15070,Raj,23, You don't know we're wrong yet.,3,Big Bang Theory,32,6
15071,Sheldon,23, Haughty derision it is.,3,Big Bang Theory,24,4
15072,Amy,23, Excuse me. I'm Amy Farrah Fowler. You're Sheldon Cooper.,3,Big Bang Theory,57,9
15073,Sheldon,23," Hello, Amy Farrah Fowler. I'm sorry to inform you that you have been taken in by unsupportable mathematics designed to prey on the gullible and the lonely. Additionally, I'm being blackmailed with a hidden dirty sock.",3,Big Bang Theory,218,36
15074,Amy,23," If that was slang, I'm unfamiliar with it. If it was literal, I share your aversion to soiled hosiery. In any case, I'm here because my mother and I have agreed that I will date at least once a year.",3,Big Bang Theory,200,40
15075,Sheldon,23, Interesting. My mother and I have the same agreement about church.,3,Big Bang Theory,67,11
15076,Amy,23," I don't object to the concept of a deity, but I'm baffled by the notion of one that takes attendance.",3,Big Bang Theory,102,20
15077,Sheldon,23," Well, then you might want to avoid East Texas.",3,Big Bang Theory,47,9
15078,Amy,23," Noted. Now, before this goes any further, you should know that all forms of physical contact up to and including coitus are off the table.",3,Big Bang Theory,139,25
15079,Sheldon,23, May I buy you a beverage?,3,Big Bang Theory,26,6
15080,Amy,23," Tepid water, please.",3,Big Bang Theory,21,3
15081,Howard,23," Good God, what have we done?",3,Big Bang Theory,29,6
15083,Howard,1, And now the kung pao chicken.,4,Big Bang Theory,30,6
15084,Leonard,1, Alright.,4,Big Bang Theory,9,1
15085,Raj,1, Smooth.,4,Big Bang Theory,8,1
15086,Howard,1," And finally, my moo shu pork.",4,Big Bang Theory,30,6
15087,Raj,1, Whoo-hoo!,4,Big Bang Theory,10,1
15088,Howard,1," Ah, there you have it, gentlemen. Our entire dinner unpacked by robot.",4,Big Bang Theory,71,12
15089,Raj,1, And it only took 28 minutes.,4,Big Bang Theory,29,6
15090,Sheldon,1," Impressive, but we must be cautious.",4,Big Bang Theory,37,6
15091,Howard,1, Why?,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
15092,Sheldon,1," Today, it's a Chinese food retrieval robot. Tomorrow, it travels back in time and tries to kill Sarah Connor.",4,Big Bang Theory,110,19
15093,Leonard,1," I don't think that's going to happen, Sheldon.",4,Big Bang Theory,47,8
15094,Sheldon,1, No one ever does. That's why it happens.,4,Big Bang Theory,41,8
15095,Penny,1, Hey. Is the food here? Ooh. What's that?,4,Big Bang Theory,41,8
15096,Howard,1," That, dear lady, is the Wolowitz Programmable Hand, designed for extravehicular repairs on the International Space Station.",4,Big Bang Theory,124,17
15097,Penny,1," Ah, cool.",4,Big Bang Theory,10,2
15098,Howard,1, Ask me to pass the soy sauce.,4,Big Bang Theory,30,7
15099,Penny,1," Oh, does that come up much on the space station?",4,Big Bang Theory,49,10
15100,Howard,1, Mostly with Asian and Jewish astronauts.,4,Big Bang Theory,41,6
15101,Penny,1, All right. Pass the soy sauce.,4,Big Bang Theory,31,6
15102,Howard,1, Coming up. ,4,Big Bang Theory,12,2
15103,Leonard,1, So how's work?,4,Big Bang Theory,15,3
15104,Penny,1," Oh, it's not bad. Kind of hungry.",4,Big Bang Theory,34,7
15105,Leonard,1," Yeah, we all are.",4,Big Bang Theory,18,4
15106,Howard,1, Just wait.,4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
15107,Sheldon,1," You realize, Penny, that the technology that went into this arm will one day make unskilled food servers such as yourself obsolete.",4,Big Bang Theory,132,22
15108,Penny,1, Really? They're going to make a robot that spits on your hamburger?,4,Big Bang Theory,68,12
15109,Sheldon,1, I thought you broke up with her. Why is she here?,4,Big Bang Theory,50,11
15110,Howard,1," Okay, here we go. Passing the soy sauce. Put out your hand.",4,Big Bang Theory,60,12
15111,Penny,1," Oh ha-ha, oh. That's amazing.",4,Big Bang Theory,30,5
15112,Sheldon,1," I wouldn't say amazing. At best, it's a modest leap forward from the basic technology that gave us Country Bear Jamboree.",4,Big Bang Theory,122,21
15113,Howard,1," Hey, Sheldon?",4,Big Bang Theory,14,2
15114,Sheldon,1, Yes?  Peace?,4,Big Bang Theory,13,2
15115,Howard,1," No, not peace. Hang on.",4,Big Bang Theory,24,5
15117,Penny,1, Does NASA know you're using that thing as a napkin holder?,4,Big Bang Theory,59,11
15118,Howard,1, You kidding? They still think it's in a secure locker at JPL.,4,Big Bang Theory,62,12
15119,Penny,1, You stole it?,4,Big Bang Theory,14,3
15120,Howard,1, Borrowed. The trick is to carry it out to your car like you own it.,4,Big Bang Theory,68,15
15121,Sheldon,1," Excuse me. Oh. Amy's at the dry cleaners, and she's made a very amusing pun. â€œI don't care for perchloroethylene, and I don't like glycol ether.â€ù Get it? She doesn't like glycol ether. Sounds like either.  L-O-L.",4,Big Bang Theory,217,37
15122,Penny,1, Who's Amy?,4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
15123,Leonard,1, His girlfriend.,4,Big Bang Theory,16,2
15124,Penny,1, Sheldon has a girlfriend?,4,Big Bang Theory,26,4
15125,Sheldon,1, She's not my girlfriend.,4,Big Bang Theory,25,4
15126,Penny,1, How long has this been going on?,4,Big Bang Theory,33,7
15127,Leonard,1, Four months.,4,Big Bang Theory,13,2
15128,Sheldon,1, She's not my girlfriend.,4,Big Bang Theory,25,4
15129,Penny,1," Are you telling me, for the past four months I have been asking you what's new and you never thought to go with Sheldon has a girlfriend?",4,Big Bang Theory,138,27
15130,Sheldon,1, She's not my girlfriend.,4,Big Bang Theory,25,4
15131,Penny,1," Ah, du-du-du-du-du. How did they meet?",4,Big Bang Theory,39,6
15132,Howard,1," Raj and I entered Sheldon's information on a dating site, and it spit out Amy Farrah Fowler.",4,Big Bang Theory,93,17
15133,Penny,1," Oh, my God! Sheldon and Amy.",4,Big Bang Theory,29,6
15134,Howard,1," Or, as we call them, Shamy.",4,Big Bang Theory,28,6
15135,Penny,1, Shamy. I am so digging the Shamy.,4,Big Bang Theory,34,7
15136,Sheldon,1," All right, everyone pay attention. Yes, I have a friend named Amy Farrah Fowler. Yes, she is female. Yes, we communicate on a daily basis, but no, she is not my girlfriend.",4,Big Bang Theory,173,32
15137,Penny,1," Okay, well, what do you communicate about?",4,Big Bang Theory,43,7
15138,Sheldon,1," Well, my work in physics, her work in neurobiology, and most recently, the possibility of our having a child together.",4,Big Bang Theory,119,20
15139,Penny,1, Thank you.,4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
15140,Leonard,1, Wait a minuteâ€“ a child? You never see this girl. You just e-mail and text and Twitter. Now you're considering having a baby?,4,Big Bang Theory,127,23
15141,Sheldon,1," Amy pointed out that between the two of us, our genetic material has the potential of producing the first in a line of intellectually superior, benign overlords to guide humanity to a brighter tomorrow.",4,Big Bang Theory,203,34
15142,Howard,1, I'm guessing that future historians will condemn us for not taking this opportunity to kill Sheldon.,4,Big Bang Theory,101,16
15143,Penny,1," Okay, I have a question.",4,Big Bang Theory,25,5
15144,Sheldon,1," Yes, Penny.",4,Big Bang Theory,12,2
15145,Penny,1, You don't even like people touching you. How are you going to have sex?,4,Big Bang Theory,72,14
15146,Sheldon,1, Why on Earth would we have sex?,4,Big Bang Theory,32,7
15147,Penny,1," Oh, honey, did your mom not have the talk with you? You know, when your private parts started growing?",4,Big Bang Theory,103,19
15148,Sheldon,1," I'm quite aware of the way humans usually reproduce, which is messy, unsanitary, and based on living next to you for three years, involves loud and unnecessary appeals to a deity.",4,Big Bang Theory,180,31
15149,Penny,1," Oh, God.",4,Big Bang Theory,9,2
15150,Sheldon,1," Yes, exactly. Consequently, if Amy and I choose to bring new life into this world, it will be accomplished clinically, with fertility experts in a lab with petri dishes. Which reminds me, you have broad hips and a certain corn-fed vigour. Is your womb available for rental?",4,Big Bang Theory,274,47
15151,Leonard,1, Still digging the Shamy?,4,Big Bang Theory,25,4
15152,Penny,1," Look, Sheldon, before you race off to the fertility clinic, you might want to think about, uh gee, I don't know, maybe actually spending some time with her.",4,Big Bang Theory,157,28
15153,Sheldon,1, You mean dating?,4,Big Bang Theory,17,3
15154,Penny,1, Yeah.,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
15155,Sheldon,1, I can't date Amy.,4,Big Bang Theory,18,4
15156,Penny,1, Why not?,4,Big Bang Theory,9,2
15157,Sheldon,1, She's not my girlfriend.,4,Big Bang Theory,25,4
15158,Penny,1," Okay, look, don't think of it as dating a girlfriend. Think of it as, uh, getting to know the future mother of your child.",4,Big Bang Theory,123,24
15159,Sheldon,1, Oh. I hadn't considered that. I suppose she will have to have access to our progeny. And you don't think I can achieve the required intimacy via text messaging?,4,Big Bang Theory,161,29
15160,Penny,1, Probably not.,4,Big Bang Theory,14,2
15161,Sheldon,1, Huh. It would appear as if the phone companies have been lying to me.,4,Big Bang Theory,70,14
15163,Sheldon,1,  Penny.  Penny.  Penny.,4,Big Bang Theory,24,3
15164,Penny,1, You do realize I stand on the other side of the door waiting for you to finish knocking three times.,4,Big Bang Theory,101,20
15165,Sheldon,1, I know. I can see the shadow of your feet under the door.,4,Big Bang Theory,58,13
15166,Penny,1," Yeah, my point is it's a waste of time.",4,Big Bang Theory,40,9
15167,Sheldon,1," If you're looking for an example of a waste of time, I would refer you to the conversation we're having right now.",4,Big Bang Theory,115,22
15168,Penny,1, What do you want?,4,Big Bang Theory,18,4
15169,Sheldon,1, I've decided to take your advice and have arranged to go on a date with Amy Farrah Fowler.,4,Big Bang Theory,91,18
15170,Penny,1," Oh, that's great. Have fun.",4,Big Bang Theory,28,5
15171,Sheldon,1, Wait. You have to drive me.,4,Big Bang Theory,28,6
15172,Penny,1, What?,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
15173,Sheldon,1, You know I don't drive.,4,Big Bang Theory,24,5
15174,Penny,1," Well, go ask Leonard.",4,Big Bang Theory,22,4
15175,Sheldon,1," I did. He said, and I quote, ask Penny, it was her cockamamie idea.",4,Big Bang Theory,68,14
15176,Penny,1, Leonard said cockamamie?,4,Big Bang Theory,25,3
15177,Sheldon,1," Actually, I'm paraphrasing. Having been raised in a Christian household, I'm uncomfortable with the language he used. And to be honest, I'm not entirely comfortable with cockamamie.",4,Big Bang Theory,182,27
15178,Penny,1," Okay, fine. When's the date?",4,Big Bang Theory,29,5
15179,Sheldon,1, Now.,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
15180,Penny,1, Now?,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
15181,Sheldon,1, Hurry. We're going to be late.,4,Big Bang Theory,31,6
15182,Penny,1," Sheldon, did it ever occur to you that I might have other plans?",4,Big Bang Theory,65,13
15183,Sheldon,1, I'm sorry. Do you have other plans?,4,Big Bang Theory,36,7
15184,Penny,1," Well, no, not per se, but",4,Big Bang Theory,26,6
15185,Sheldon,1, So this conversation is as pointless as your door-knocking soliloquy?,4,Big Bang Theory,70,10
15186,Penny,1, Let me get my cockamamie keys.,4,Big Bang Theory,31,6
15188,Howard,1," Oh, God, that feels so good. Yeah, that's the spot. Oh, baby.",4,Big Bang Theory,62,12
15190,Howard,1," I'll eat later. I'm busy! Oh, yeah. Just like a real hand. Hmm.",4,Big Bang Theory,64,13
15192,Sheldon,1, Thank you for driving me.,4,Big Bang Theory,26,5
15193,Penny,1, You're welcome.,4,Big Bang Theory,16,2
15194,Sheldon,1, I wish you weren't wearing flip-flops. It's dangerous to drive in flip-flops.,4,Big Bang Theory,78,12
15195,Penny,1, Sheldon.,4,Big Bang Theory,9,1
15196,Sheldon,1, Sorry. I just don't want to be yet another flip-flop fatality.,4,Big Bang Theory,63,11
15197,Penny,1, Can I ask you a question?,4,Big Bang Theory,26,6
15198,Sheldon,1," Given your community college education, I encourage you to ask me as many as possible.",4,Big Bang Theory,87,15
15199,Penny,1," Yeah. Well, my question is, and I'm pretty sure I know the answer, is this your first date?",4,Big Bang Theory,92,18
15200,Sheldon,1, That depends. Does square-dancing with my sister at a Teens for Jesus Fourth of July Hoedown count as a date?,4,Big Bang Theory,110,20
15201,Penny,1, No.,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
15202,Sheldon,1," Then, this is my first date.",4,Big Bang Theory,29,6
15203,Penny,1," Okay. Well, then, there's a couple of things you should probably know.",4,Big Bang Theory,71,12
15204,Sheldon,1," I have a master's degree and two doctorates. The things I should know, I do know.",4,Big Bang Theory,82,16
15205,Penny,1," My point is, I know more about dating than you, and if you were as smart as you think you are, you would listen to me.",4,Big Bang Theory,119,26
15206,Sheldon,1," If you know so much, how come I have a date tonight and you have nothing better to do than drive me to it?",4,Big Bang Theory,107,24
15207,Penny,1, Fair point.,4,Big Bang Theory,12,2
15209,Raj,1," You know, there's something I've always wondered about Aquaman.",4,Big Bang Theory,64,9
15210,Leonard,1, Yeah?,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
15211,Raj,1, Where does he poop?,4,Big Bang Theory,20,4
15212,Leonard,1, What?,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
15213,Raj,1," What would a toilet look like in Atlantis? How would you flush it? And when you did flush it, where would the poop go?",4,Big Bang Theory,119,24
15214,Leonard,1," Hold that thought. Hey, Howard, what's going on? What? Hold on, Howard, Howard, slow down. The robot hand is stuck on your what?  You're not going to believe this.",4,Big Bang Theory,164,29
15216,Penny,1," So, um, Amy, Sheldon tells me you're a neuro something-or-other.",4,Big Bang Theory,65,10
15217,Amy,1, Neurobiologist. Your check engine light is on.,4,Big Bang Theory,47,7
15218,Penny,1," Yeah, it's okay.",4,Big Bang Theory,17,3
15219,Amy,1, But the light indicates,4,Big Bang Theory,24,4
15220,Sheldon,1, Don't bother. I've wasted many an hour tilting at that particular windmill.,4,Big Bang Theory,76,12
15221,Penny,1," Um, what is that scent you're wearing? It smells great.",4,Big Bang Theory,56,10
15222,Amy,1, Dandruff shampoo. I have dry scalp.,4,Big Bang Theory,36,6
15223,Penny,1," Ah. Well, your hair looks very nice.",4,Big Bang Theory,37,7
15224,Amy,1, Are you a homosexual?,4,Big Bang Theory,22,4
15225,Penny,1," No, no, I was just giving you a compliment.",4,Big Bang Theory,44,9
15226,Amy,1, Hmm. Would have been more flattered if you were a homosexual.,4,Big Bang Theory,62,11
15227,Penny,1," Guys, how 'bout some music?",4,Big Bang Theory,28,5
15228,Sheldon,1," Oh, no, I wouldn't care for that. Amy?",4,Big Bang Theory,39,8
15229,Amy,1," No, thank you.",4,Big Bang Theory,15,3
15230,Penny,1," Okay. Uncomfortable silence it is. Hey, Sheldon, have you told Amy what it was like for you growing up in Texas?",4,Big Bang Theory,113,21
15231,Sheldon,1, No.,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
15232,Penny,1," Well, why don't you tell her?",4,Big Bang Theory,30,6
15233,Sheldon,1, All right. It was hell.,4,Big Bang Theory,24,5
15234,Penny,1," Any follow up, Amy?",4,Big Bang Theory,20,4
15235,Amy,1, No.,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
15236,Penny,1," I myself grew up in Nebraska. Small town outside of Omaha. You know, nice place, mostly family farms, a few meth labs.",4,Big Bang Theory,119,22
15237,Sheldon,1," I'm sorry, how is this better than uncomfortable silence?",4,Big Bang Theory,58,9
15238,Penny,1, I don't know. I was just trying something.,4,Big Bang Theory,43,8
15239,Sheldon,1, Muggles.,4,Big Bang Theory,9,1
15241,Raj,1, You slipped and fell into a robot hand?,4,Big Bang Theory,40,8
15242,Howard,1, Yes.,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
15243,Raj,1, Penis first?,4,Big Bang Theory,13,2
15244,Howard,1," Yes. Now, help me!",4,Big Bang Theory,19,4
15245,Leonard,1," I'd suggest a lubricant, but I have a feeling you fell on some of that as well.",4,Big Bang Theory,80,17
15246,Howard,1," Not funny, Leonard.",4,Big Bang Theory,20,3
15247,Raj,1," Really? A robot hand's got a death grip on your junk, dude. That's funny, ask anyone.",4,Big Bang Theory,86,16
15248,Howard,1," Please, before my mother walks in, just get this off me!",4,Big Bang Theory,57,11
15249,Leonard,1," Okay, let's see.",4,Big Bang Theory,17,3
15250,Howard,1," No, no! Don't touch, the program is paused.",4,Big Bang Theory,44,8
15251,Leonard,1," Well, then let's un-pause it.",4,Big Bang Theory,30,5
15252,Howard,1," No, no! I loaded the wrong program. The hand thinks it's holding a screwdriver in outer space. If you continue the program, it's gonna start twisting.",4,Big Bang Theory,151,26
15253,Raj,1," A-All right, um, how about this. When, when Winnie the Pooh got his head stuck in the honey tree, his friends all grabbed onto him and pulled and pulled.",4,Big Bang Theory,154,29
15254,Leonard,1," You do what you want, I'm not touching another man's honey tree.",4,Big Bang Theory,65,12
15255,Raj,1," All right, uh, forget pulling. How about we get an electric saw and cut it off?",4,Big Bang Theory,80,16
15256,Howard,1, What? No saws! One circumcision was enough.,4,Big Bang Theory,44,7
15257,Leonard,1, How about an acetylene torch?,4,Big Bang Theory,30,5
15258,Howard,1," Okay, I can't believe this needs to be said out loud. No pulling, no saws, no torches.",4,Big Bang Theory,87,17
15259,Leonard,1," Well, then what do you want us to do?",4,Big Bang Theory,38,9
15260,Howard,1, I,4,Big Bang Theory,2,1
15262,Howard,1," That's great, Mom, thanks!",4,Big Bang Theory,27,4
15264,Howard,1, Don't come up here!,4,Big Bang Theory,20,4
15266,Howard,1," Yes, but that's not the point! Get me out of here.",4,Big Bang Theory,51,11
15267,Leonard,1," You have any ideas, Raj?",4,Big Bang Theory,25,5
15268,Raj,1," Right now, all I can think about is cookies and Hawaiian Punch.",4,Big Bang Theory,64,12
15270,Penny,1," Hey, here's another possible topic of conversation. This is a big night for Sheldon. Right, Sheldon?",4,Big Bang Theory,101,16
15271,Sheldon,1, Big night? The winter solstice is a big night. It's over 14 hours in Southern California.,4,Big Bang Theory,90,16
15272,Amy,1, That's an amusing factoid.,4,Big Bang Theory,27,4
15273,Sheldon,1, Thank you.,4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
15274,Penny,1," No, no. My point is, uh, tonight is Sheldon's first official date. Discuss.",4,Big Bang Theory,76,13
15275,Amy,1, Is this true?,4,Big Bang Theory,14,3
15276,Sheldon,1," Apparently, a semi-incestuous Teens for Jesus Fourth of July Hoedown didn't count.",4,Big Bang Theory,83,12
15277,Penny,1," So, um, Amy, what about you? Do you date much?",4,Big Bang Theory,47,10
15278,Amy,1," Once a year. It's a deal I made with my mother in exchange for her silence on the matter, as well as the occasional use of her George Foreman Grill that seals in the flavour without the fat. How about you, Penny? Do you go on many dates?",4,Big Bang Theory,238,48
15279,Penny,1," Uh, yeah, I wouldn't say many. A few. . What's ",4,Big Bang Theory,48,10
15280,Sheldon,1, Your characterization of approximately 171 different men as a few.,4,Big Bang Theory,67,10
15281,Penny,1, What? Where did you get 171 men?,4,Big Bang Theory,33,7
15282,Sheldon,1," Simple extrapolation. In the three years that I've known you, you were single for two. During that time, I saw 17 different suitors. If we work backwards, correcting for observation bias and postulate an initial dating age of 15",4,Big Bang Theory,229,39
15283,Penny,1," Whoa, wait, wait, wait. I did not start dating at 15.",4,Big Bang Theory,54,11
15284,Sheldon,1, I'm sorry. 16?,4,Big Bang Theory,15,3
15285,Penny,1,14,4,Big Bang Theory,2,1
15286,Sheldon,1," My mistake. Now, assuming the left side of a bell curve peaking around the present, that would bring the total up to 193 men. Plus or minus eight men.",4,Big Bang Theory,151,29
15287,Amy,1, Remarkable. Did you have sexual intercourse with all of these men?,4,Big Bang Theory,67,11
15288,Penny,1, No.,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
15289,Sheldon,1, Although that number would be fairly easy to calculate.,4,Big Bang Theory,56,9
15290,Penny,1, Oh.,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
15291,Sheldon,1," Based on the number of awkward encounters I've had with strange men leaving her apartment in the morning, plus the number of times she's returned home wearing the same clothes she wore the night before",4,Big Bang Theory,202,35
15292,Penny,1," Okay, Sheldon, I think you've made your point.",4,Big Bang Theory,47,8
15293,Sheldon,1," So we multiply 193, minus 21 men before the loss of virginity, so 172 times 0.18 gives us 30.96 sexual partners. Let's round that up to 31.",4,Big Bang Theory,140,27
15294,Penny,1," Okay, Sheldon, you are so wrong. That is not even close to the real number. I'm gonna need a drink over here.",4,Big Bang Theory,110,22
15295,Amy,1," This is very interesting. Cultural perceptions are subjective. Penny, to your mind, are you a slut?",4,Big Bang Theory,100,16
15296,Penny,1," No! No! No. Let's just all finish our dinners, okay?",4,Big Bang Theory,53,10
15297,Sheldon,1, This is an interesting topic. How many sexual encounters have you had?,4,Big Bang Theory,71,12
15298,Amy,1, Does volunteering for a scientific experiment in which orgasm was achieved by electronically stimulating the pleasure centres of the brain count?,4,Big Bang Theory,146,21
15299,Sheldon,1, I should think so.,4,Big Bang Theory,19,4
15300,Amy,1, Then 128.,4,Big Bang Theory,10,2
15302,Leonard,1," Okay, come on. Almost there.",4,Big Bang Theory,29,5
15303,Howard,1, Don't tug. No tugging.,4,Big Bang Theory,23,4
15304,Raj,1," Next time, take your own advice.",4,Big Bang Theory,33,6
15305,Leonard,1," Excuse me, could you help us out?",4,Big Bang Theory,34,7
15307,Howard,1, I slipped and fell.,4,Big Bang Theory,20,4
15309,Howard,1, It's a robot arm.,4,Big Bang Theory,18,4
15311,Howard,1, I only built the arm.,4,Big Bang Theory,22,5
15313,Howard,1, Can you please just help me?,4,Big Bang Theory,29,6
15315,Howard,1, You think you could be a little more discreet?,4,Big Bang Theory,47,9
15317,Leonard,1," Uh, it's what controls the arm.",4,Big Bang Theory,32,6
15318,Howard,1, But it's frozen.,4,Big Bang Theory,17,3
15320,Howard,1," No, you see, it's more complicated than that.  No, wait!  Winnie the Pooh is out of the honey tree.",4,Big Bang Theory,100,19
15321,Raj,1, Now can we have cookies and Hawaiian Punch?,4,Big Bang Theory,44,8
15323,Sheldon,1, You were right. This was a very productive evening. I saw a whole new side of Amy Farrah Fowler tonight.,4,Big Bang Theory,105,20
15324,Penny,1, I did not have sex with 31 guys.,4,Big Bang Theory,33,8
15325,Sheldon,1," I'll be happy to check the math, but numbers don't lie, Penny. In any event, now that Amy and I have spent quality time together, I feel much more confident proceeding to the next stage of our relationship.",4,Big Bang Theory,207,38
15326,Penny,1, And that is?,4,Big Bang Theory,13,3
15327,Sheldon,1, Using in vitro fertilization and a surrogate uterus to gift humanity with our progeny.,4,Big Bang Theory,87,14
15328,Penny,1, You're still on that?,4,Big Bang Theory,22,4
15329,Sheldon,1," In these uncertain times, doesn't humanity deserve a gift?",4,Big Bang Theory,59,9
15330,Penny,1," Okay, you know what? I'm gonna come at this in a whole new way. Sheldon, if you try to make a baby with Amy in a petri dish, I'm gonna tell your mother on you.",4,Big Bang Theory,160,35
15331,Sheldon,1, That's no threat. My mother's always wanted a grandchild.,4,Big Bang Theory,58,9
15332,Penny,1, Really? Your deeply religious born-again Christian mother wants a test-tube grandbaby born out of wedlock?,4,Big Bang Theory,107,15
15333,Sheldon,1, Curses.,4,Big Bang Theory,8,1
15334,Penny,1," If I'd thought of that in the first place, I could've saved myself this whole night.",4,Big Bang Theory,85,16
15335,Sheldon,1," Well, it's not that late. You could still go out and look for number 32. Good night.",4,Big Bang Theory,85,17
15336,Leonard,1," Hey, Howard, what's up?",4,Big Bang Theory,24,4
15337,Sheldon,1, I've decided not to procreate.,4,Big Bang Theory,31,5
15338,Leonard,1," Yeah, yeah, great. Howard, uh, slow down. What do you mean it happened again?",4,Big Bang Theory,78,14
15340,Leonard,2, Whatcha doin' there? Working on a new plan to catch the roadrunner?,4,Big Bang Theory,68,12
15341,Sheldon,2, The humorous implication being that I am Wile E. Coyote?,4,Big Bang Theory,57,10
15342,Leonard,2, Yes.,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
15343,Sheldon,2, And this is a schematic for a bird-trapping device that will ultimately backfire and cause me physical injury?,4,Big Bang Theory,111,18
15344,Leonard,2, Yes.,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
15345,Sheldon,2, What I'm doing here is trying to determine when I'm going to die.,4,Big Bang Theory,66,13
15346,Leonard,2, A lot of people are working on that research. So what is all this?,4,Big Bang Theory,67,14
15347,Sheldon,2," My family history factoring in longevity, propensity for disease, et cetera.",4,Big Bang Theory,77,11
15348,Leonard,2, Interesting. Cause of death for Uncle Carl was KBB. What's KBB?,4,Big Bang Theory,64,11
15349,Sheldon,2, Killed by badger.,4,Big Bang Theory,18,3
15350,Leonard,2, How's that?,4,Big Bang Theory,12,2
15351,Sheldon,2," It was Thanksgiving. Uncle Carl said, I think there's a badger living in our chimney. Hand me that flashlight. Those were the last words he ever spoke to us.",4,Big Bang Theory,158,29
15352,Leonard,2, I don't think you need to worry about death by badgers being hereditary.,4,Big Bang Theory,73,13
15353,Sheldon,2," Not true. The fight or flight instinct is coded genetically. Instead of fleeing, he chose to fight barehanded against a brawny member of the weasel family. Who's to say that I don't share that flawed DNA?",4,Big Bang Theory,205,36
15354,Leonard,2, You can always get a badger and find out.,4,Big Bang Theory,42,9
15355,Sheldon,2," But seriously, even if I disregard the Uncle Carl factor, at best I have 60 years left.",4,Big Bang Theory,88,17
15356,Leonard,2," That long, huh?",4,Big Bang Theory,16,3
15357,Sheldon,2, 60 only takes me to here. I need to get to here.,4,Big Bang Theory,49,12
15358,Leonard,2, What's there?,4,Big Bang Theory,14,2
15359,Sheldon,2," The earliest estimate of the singularity, when man will be able to transfer his consciousness into machines and achieve immortality.",4,Big Bang Theory,133,20
15360,Leonard,2," So, you're upset about missing out on becoming some sort of freakish self-aware robot?",4,Big Bang Theory,87,14
15361,Sheldon,2, By this much.,4,Big Bang Theory,14,3
15362,Leonard,2, Tough break. You want eggs?,4,Big Bang Theory,28,5
15363,Sheldon,2," You don't get it, Leonard. I'm going to miss so much, the unified field theory, cold fusion, the dogapus.",4,Big Bang Theory,106,19
15364,Leonard,2, What's a dogapus?,4,Big Bang Theory,18,3
15365,Sheldon,2, A hybrid dog and octopus. Man's underwater best friend.,4,Big Bang Theory,56,9
15366,Leonard,2, Is somebody working on that?,4,Big Bang Theory,29,5
15367,Sheldon,2, I was going to. I planned on giving it to myself on my 300th birthday.,4,Big Bang Theory,71,15
15368,Leonard,2, Wait a minute. You hate dogs.,4,Big Bang Theory,30,6
15369,Sheldon,2, A dogapus can play fetch with eight balls. No one can hate that.,4,Big Bang Theory,65,13
15371,Howard,2, What do we owe you?,4,Big Bang Theory,20,5
15372,Leonard,2, It came to $28.17. Let's say six bucks apiece.,4,Big Bang Theory,47,9
15373,Howard,2, Here you go.,4,Big Bang Theory,13,3
15374,Leonard,2, Thank you.,4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
15375,Penny,2, What?,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
15376,Leonard,2, Never mind. I got it.,4,Big Bang Theory,22,5
15377,Penny,2," Oh, you wanted me to pay.",4,Big Bang Theory,26,6
15378,Leonard,2, It's no big deal.,4,Big Bang Theory,18,4
15379,Penny,2," No, no, no, no. You're right. We're not going out anymore, I should pay for myself.  What?",4,Big Bang Theory,91,17
15380,Howard,2," He said if he had woman parts, he'd eat for free the rest of his life.",4,Big Bang Theory,71,16
15381,Penny,2," Yeah, but you wouldn't be able to talk to yourself. I'm a little low on cash.",4,Big Bang Theory,78,16
15382,Leonard,2, Hmm? How much you got?,4,Big Bang Theory,23,5
15383,Penny,2, Nothing.,4,Big Bang Theory,9,1
15384,Leonard,2, How can you walk around with no money?,4,Big Bang Theory,39,8
15385,Penny,2, I'm cute. I get by.,4,Big Bang Theory,20,5
15386,Leonard,2," It's okay, you can owe me.",4,Big Bang Theory,27,6
15387,Penny,2, Okay.,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
15388,Leonard,2," Sheldon, six bucks.",4,Big Bang Theory,20,3
15389,Sheldon,2," No, thank you. I'm not eating pizza tonight.",4,Big Bang Theory,45,8
15390,Penny,2, But it's Thursday. Thursday's pizza night.,4,Big Bang Theory,43,6
15391,Sheldon,2," Not for me. Thursday is now Cruciferous Vegetable Night. Tonight's selection, brussels sprouts.",4,Big Bang Theory,96,13
15392,Howard,2, Really? You're changing the Sheldonian calendar?,4,Big Bang Theory,49,6
15393,Sheldon,2, It's a small price to pay.,4,Big Bang Theory,27,6
15394,Penny,2, For what?,4,Big Bang Theory,10,2
15395,Leonard,2," No, no, don't ask.",4,Big Bang Theory,19,4
15396,Penny,2," Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.",4,Big Bang Theory,35,5
15397,Sheldon,2," In order to live long enough to fuse my consciousness with cybernetics, I need to change my diet.",4,Big Bang Theory,98,18
15398,Penny,2," Wait. Cybernetics is robot stuff, right?",4,Big Bang Theory,41,6
15399,Sheldon,2, Correct.,4,Big Bang Theory,9,1
15400,Penny,2, So you want to turn yourself into some sort of robot?,4,Big Bang Theory,54,11
15401,Sheldon,2," Essentially, yes.",4,Big Bang Theory,18,2
15402,Penny,2," Okay, here's my question. Didn't you already do that?",4,Big Bang Theory,54,9
15403,Sheldon,2," Flattering, but sadly, no. I'm also planning to begin an exercise regimen designed to strengthen my cardiovascular system. AKA jogging.",4,Big Bang Theory,136,20
15404,Penny,2," Wait. Honey,have you ever run before?",4,Big Bang Theory,38,6
15405,Sheldon,2," Certainly. I've run from bullies, dogs, angry chickens, and one particularly persistent P.E. teacher determined to bend me over and give me a scoliosis test.",4,Big Bang Theory,158,25
15406,Howard,2," You're right, Penny jogs. Maybe you guys can run together.",4,Big Bang Theory,59,10
15407,Sheldon,2," That's an excellent idea. Yeah, if we chat, it will create the illusion of time going faster.",4,Big Bang Theory,94,17
15408,Penny,2," No, it won't. Um, how does he know I jog?",4,Big Bang Theory,42,10
15409,Howard,2," Oh, he watches you from his car with high-powered binoculars.",4,Big Bang Theory,62,10
15410,Penny,2," Oh, my God, that is so creepy!",4,Big Bang Theory,31,7
15411,Howard,2, I know!  And he says he's not gonna stop.  Then see a shrink and figure out how to talk to women.,4,Big Bang Theory,98,21
15413,Sheldon,2,  Ugh.  U-u-ugh.  Lenu-u-ugh.,4,Big Bang Theory,29,3
15414,Leonard,2, What the hell? What's the matter?,4,Big Bang Theory,34,6
15415,Sheldon,2, I have pain radiating from my navel to my lower right abdomen. I'm nauseated and feverish. I believe I may have cholera.,4,Big Bang Theory,121,22
15416,Leonard,2," There's no cholera in Pasadena. Just like last summer, when there was no malaria in Pasadena.",4,Big Bang Theory,94,16
15417,Sheldon,2," Well, if it's not cholera, then based on a quick Internet search, the other explanations in decreasing order of likelihood are Hirschsprung's Disease, botulism, a 30-foot tapeworm or accidental ingestion of chrysanthemum blossoms.",4,Big Bang Theory,231,33
15418,Leonard,2, When would you have accidentally eaten chrysanthemum blossoms?,4,Big Bang Theory,63,8
15419,Sheldon,2," It's part of an unlikely scenario that involves sleepwalking and a 24-hour flower mart with a less-than-vigilant proprietor. Oh, Lord, my belly!",4,Big Bang Theory,145,22
15420,Leonard,2, Have you had your appendix out?,4,Big Bang Theory,32,6
15421,Sheldon,2," I haven't. I've been meaning to, but who has the time?",4,Big Bang Theory,55,11
15422,Leonard,2, Let's get you to the hospital.,4,Big Bang Theory,31,6
15423,Sheldon,2," So this is how it ends, with cruel irony. Just as I make the commitment to preserving my body, I am betrayed by my appendix, a vestigial organ. Do you know the original purpose of the appendix, Leonard?",4,Big Bang Theory,203,38
15424,Leonard,2, No.,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
15425,Sheldon,2, I do. And yet I'm doomed while you live on.,4,Big Bang Theory,44,10
15426,Leonard,2," Funny how things work out, isn't it?",4,Big Bang Theory,37,7
15427,Sheldon,2," Oh, Lord, I think it's about to burst!  On the other hand, it might have been the Brussels sprouts.",4,Big Bang Theory,100,19
15428,Leonard,2, Good night.,4,Big Bang Theory,12,2
15429,Sheldon,2, Good night. Appendicitis. What a nervous Nelly.,4,Big Bang Theory,48,7
15431,Sheldon,2,  Penny.  Penny.  Penny.,4,Big Bang Theory,24,3
15432,Penny,2," Coming, coming. Hey, nice knees.",4,Big Bang Theory,33,5
15433,Sheldon,2, Thank you. They're my mother's.,4,Big Bang Theory,32,5
15434,Penny,2, Oh. And the Flash shirt is what? Because you're gonna run really fast?,4,Big Bang Theory,71,13
15435,Sheldon,2," No, the Flash shirt is because it's Friday, but it's nice when things work out. Where's your heart rate monitor?",4,Big Bang Theory,113,20
15436,Penny,2, I don't have one.,4,Big Bang Theory,18,4
15437,Sheldon,2, What about your pedometer?,4,Big Bang Theory,27,4
15438,Penny,2, Don't have one.,4,Big Bang Theory,16,3
15439,Sheldon,2, Do you have telematics in your shoes connected to an iPod?,4,Big Bang Theory,59,11
15440,Penny,2," Uh, no.",4,Big Bang Theory,8,2
15441,Sheldon,2," What do you do, you just go out there and gambol about like a bunny?",4,Big Bang Theory,69,15
15442,Penny,2," No. I just run till I'm hungry, then I stop for a bear claw.",4,Big Bang Theory,61,14
15443,Sheldon,2, Why are you doing that?,4,Big Bang Theory,24,5
15444,Penny,2, It's good to stretch your muscles before you run.,4,Big Bang Theory,50,9
15445,Sheldon,2, All right.,4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
15446,Penny,2," All right, let's start with a toe touch. Okay, you do it.",4,Big Bang Theory,58,12
15447,Sheldon,2, I am doing it.,4,Big Bang Theory,15,4
15448,Penny,2," Oh. Wow. Good job. Okay, um, can you do this?",4,Big Bang Theory,46,10
15449,Sheldon,2, We'll never know.,4,Big Bang Theory,18,3
15450,Penny,2," Okay, let's just warm up on the run.",4,Big Bang Theory,37,8
15451,Sheldon,2, Okay.,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
15452,Penny,2," Okay, let's go.",4,Big Bang Theory,16,3
15453,Sheldon,2," Yeah, I've been reading up on biomechanics. I think you'll be surprised at my Wah! Oh!",4,Big Bang Theory,87,16
15454,Penny,2," Oh, my God, are you okay?",4,Big Bang Theory,26,6
15455,Sheldon,2, I think so.,4,Big Bang Theory,12,3
15456,Penny,2," Oh, let me help you up.",4,Big Bang Theory,24,6
15457,Sheldon,2, Thank you. ,4,Big Bang Theory,12,2
15458,Penny,2," Oh, Sheldon!",4,Big Bang Theory,13,2
15459,Sheldon,2," If it makes you feel any better, Thursday is no longer Cruciferous Vegetable Night.",4,Big Bang Theory,84,14
15461,Leonard,2," Here's my chicken curry. Howard, your shrimp biryani.",4,Big Bang Theory,54,8
15462,Howard,2," Thank you, sir.",4,Big Bang Theory,16,3
15463,Leonard,2," Palak paneer, that's Penny.",4,Big Bang Theory,28,4
15464,Penny,2, Thanks.,4,Big Bang Theory,8,1
15465,Leonard,2," And for Rajesh Koothrappali, from whose homeland these tasty dishes originate, one large order of chicken McNuggets.",4,Big Bang Theory,117,17
15466,Penny,2," Hey, what's my share?",4,Big Bang Theory,22,4
15467,Leonard,2," Uh, 12 bucks.",4,Big Bang Theory,14,3
15468,Penny,2," Okay, can I get you after Friday when I get paid?",4,Big Bang Theory,50,11
15469,Leonard,2, Sure.,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
15470,Penny,2, What am I up to now?,4,Big Bang Theory,21,6
15471,Leonard,2," Well, okay, with the Indian food, the pizza, the Thai food, the tank of gas, the frozen yogurt and your rent, uh, a little over fourteen hundred dollars.",4,Big Bang Theory,154,28
15472,Penny,2, What now?,4,Big Bang Theory,10,2
15473,Howard,2, He's just expressing his admiration that you don't even have to put out to get free stuff.,4,Big Bang Theory,91,17
15474,Penny,2," It's not free, I'm gonna pay him back.  Shut up!",4,Big Bang Theory,49,10
15475,Leonard,2," Sheldon, are you gonna join us?",4,Big Bang Theory,32,6
15476,Sheldon,2," Coming! . Greetings, friends.",4,Big Bang Theory,30,4
15477,Leonard,2," Greetings, whatever the hell you are.",4,Big Bang Theory,38,6
15479,Howard,2, Really? That's your question? When did he put a ramp in?,4,Big Bang Theory,57,11
15481,Penny,2," Yeah, to be honest, I don't see much difference.",4,Big Bang Theory,49,9
15483,Leonard,2, This is ridiculous. I'm coming to talk to you.,4,Big Bang Theory,47,9
15485,Leonard,2, You're in your bedroom.,4,Big Bang Theory,24,4
15487,Leonard,2, I can hear your voice coming from your bedroom.,4,Big Bang Theory,48,9
15489,Penny,2," So, either one of you weirdos want to buy my underwear? Only fourteen hundred bucks.",4,Big Bang Theory,85,15
15491,Leonard,2," Sheldon, this is ridiculous.",4,Big Bang Theory,29,4
15492,Sheldon,2, I'm behind you. Please look at me when you're talking to me.,4,Big Bang Theory,61,12
15493,Leonard,2, I am looking at you.,4,Big Bang Theory,21,5
15494,Sheldon,2," No, you're not. Pay no attention to that man in the bed.",4,Big Bang Theory,57,12
15495,Leonard,2," You cannot exist as a virtual presence. Not here and certainly not at work. Oh, good God.",4,Big Bang Theory,90,17
15496,Sheldon,2," At my age, do you know how I'm statistically most likely to die?",4,Big Bang Theory,65,13
15497,Leonard,2, At the hands of your roommate?,4,Big Bang Theory,31,6
15498,Sheldon,2, An accident.,4,Big Bang Theory,13,2
15499,Leonard,2, That's how I'm going to make it look.,4,Big Bang Theory,38,8
15500,Sheldon,2," Until I can transfer my intellect to a more durable container, my body will remain safely ensconced in my bed.",4,Big Bang Theory,111,20
15501,Leonard,2," Fine, but don't expect my help.",4,Big Bang Theory,32,6
15502,Sheldon,2," You have to help, it's in the roommate agreement.",4,Big Bang Theory,50,9
15503,Leonard,2," No, it's not.",4,Big Bang Theory,14,3
15504,Sheldon,2, Section 74.C. The various obligations and duties of the parties in the event one of them becomes a robot.,4,Big Bang Theory,106,19
15505,Leonard,2, I'll be damned.,4,Big Bang Theory,16,3
15508,Leonard,2, Uh-huh.,4,Big Bang Theory,8,1
15510,Leonard,2, Refresh my memory. Why didn't I just put you in the trunk?,4,Big Bang Theory,59,12
15512,Leonard,2, Right.,4,Big Bang Theory,7,1
15514,Leonard,2," I don't want to listen to music, Sheldon.",4,Big Bang Theory,42,8
15516,Leonard,2," Except in Knight Rider, the car isn't a yammering sphincter.",4,Big Bang Theory,61,10
15518,Leonard,2," I was wrong, this is exactly like Knight Rider.",4,Big Bang Theory,48,9
15520,Leonard,2, No.,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
15522,Leonard,2, That's it. Bye-bye. ,4,Big Bang Theory,21,3
15524,Leonard,2, Whoa!,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
15526,Leonard,2, I almost died!,4,Big Bang Theory,15,3
15528,Leonard,2, I'm still going to go with you.,4,Big Bang Theory,32,7
15531,Leonard,2, What about it?,4,Big Bang Theory,15,3
15533,Leonard,2, Why? What's the problem?,4,Big Bang Theory,25,4
15535,Leonard,2," No, I think a doorknob has you stymied.",4,Big Bang Theory,40,8
15536,Howard,2," Oh, look, it's Leonard and R2-D-Bag.",4,Big Bang Theory,37,6
15537,Raj,2, That's my joke. I told it last night. You can't just use it.,4,Big Bang Theory,61,13
15539,Raj,2," Oh, sure.",4,Big Bang Theory,10,2
15541,Raj,2, I'm a lamb.,4,Big Bang Theory,12,3
15544,Howard,2, I say we just take him to Tatooine and sell him to some Jawas.,4,Big Bang Theory,63,14

15546,Penny,2," Oh, great. Hi, I'm Penny, I'll be your waitress.",4,Big Bang Theory,49,9
15547,Leonard,2, Why are you introducing yourself?,4,Big Bang Theory,34,5
15548,Penny,2, I'd rather people not know I have any prior connection to you whatsoever.,4,Big Bang Theory,74,13
15550,Penny,2," Sheldon, I'm not waiting on you.",4,Big Bang Theory,33,6
15552,Penny,2, Because you're not here.,4,Big Bang Theory,25,4
15554,Howard,2, Is that Steve Wozniak?,4,Big Bang Theory,23,4
15555,Leonard,2, I think it is.,4,Big Bang Theory,15,4
15557,Leonard,2," Penny, Steve Wozniak was one of the cofounders of Apple Computer. He and Steve Jobs started it",4,Big Bang Theory,95,17
15558,Penny,2," Yeah, I know who he is. I watch Dancing with the Stars.",4,Big Bang Theory,56,12
15560,Leonard,2, Of course you must.,4,Big Bang Theory,20,4
15561,Penny,2," You know, there's an Olive Garden down the street. You guys should try it sometime.",4,Big Bang Theory,84,15
15573,Sheldon,2," I'm coming, Woz, I'm coming.  Ow! Aw.",4,Big Bang Theory,38,7
15576,Penny,2," What up, Shel-Bot?",4,Big Bang Theory,19,3
15578,Penny,2, What do you want me to do?,4,Big Bang Theory,27,7
15580,Penny,2," Really, you want me to sing Soft Kitty to a computer monitor?",4,Big Bang Theory,62,12
15582,Penny,2," Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur.",4,Big Bang Theory,44,8
15584,Penny,2," Happy kitty, sleepy",4,Big Bang Theory,20,3
15586,Penny,2," Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr.",4,Big Bang Theory,89,15

15596,Sheldon,3, Defend.,4,Big Bang Theory,8,1
15597,Amy,3, Isn't it obvious?,4,Big Bang Theory,18,3
15598,Sheldon,3, You're right. My apologies.,4,Big Bang Theory,28,4
15599,Leonard,3, What the hell are you guys playing?,4,Big Bang Theory,36,7
15600,Sheldon,3, It's a game we invented. It's called Counterfactuals.,4,Big Bang Theory,54,8
15601,Amy,3, We postulate an alternate world that differs from ours in one key aspect and then pose questions to each other.,4,Big Bang Theory,112,20
15602,Sheldon,3, It's fun for ages eight to eighty. Join us.,4,Big Bang Theory,44,9
15603,Leonard,3, All right. I like a good brainteaser. Give it a whirl.,4,Big Bang Theory,55,11
15604,Sheldon,3," You're in luck, this is an easy one. In a world where mankind is ruled by a giant intelligent beaver, what food is no longer consumed?",4,Big Bang Theory,135,26
15605,Leonard,3," Uh, a BLT where the B stands for beaver? I don't know.",4,Big Bang Theory,55,12
15606,Sheldon,3," Leonard, be serious. We're playing a game here.",4,Big Bang Theory,48,8
15607,Leonard,3," I can figure this out, let's see. Um, well, beavers eat tree bark. The only tree bark I know that humans consume is cinnamon. So, I'll say cinnamon.",4,Big Bang Theory,149,28
15608,Sheldon,3," Incorrect. Obviously, the answer is cheese Danish.",4,Big Bang Theory,51,7
15609,Leonard,3, What?,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
15610,Amy,3," In a world ruled by a giant beaver, mankind builds many dams to please the beaver overlord. The low-lying city of Copenhagen is flooded. Thousands die. Devastated, the Danes never invent their namesake pastry. How does one miss that?",4,Big Bang Theory,234,39
15611,Leonard,3, This is ridiculous. You're just making stuff up.,4,Big Bang Theory,49,8
15612,Amy,3, Is he always like this when he loses?,4,Big Bang Theory,38,8
15613,Sheldon,3," Oh, yes. You should've been here for the great Jenga tantrum of 2008.",4,Big Bang Theory,70,13
15614,Leonard,3, You bumped the table and you know it.,4,Big Bang Theory,38,8
15615,Amy,3, Perhaps it would be kinder to play a game more suited to his abilities. We'll close our eyes and count to ten while you hide.,4,Big Bang Theory,126,25
15616,Leonard,3, I'm going to my room.,4,Big Bang Theory,22,5
15617,Amy,3," Very good, Leonard. But next time, don't tell us where you're hiding.",4,Big Bang Theory,70,12
15619,Leonard,3, Did you guys see the paper in The American Physics Journal on supersolids? It's pretty interesting. This guy's working from a hypothesis where,4,Big Bang Theory,143,23
15620,Raj,3, Spoiler alert! Spoiler alert.,4,Big Bang Theory,30,4
15621,Leonard,3, What?,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
15622,Raj,3," Don't ruin it for me, man. I printed out a PDF to read on the potty.",4,Big Bang Theory,69,16
15623,Howard,3," On the potty? What are you, five?",4,Big Bang Theory,34,7
15624,Raj,3, It's a potty. What do you call it?,4,Big Bang Theory,35,8
15625,Howard,3, Toilet.,4,Big Bang Theory,8,1
15626,Raj,3," That's a little vulgar for the dinner table, don't you think?",4,Big Bang Theory,62,11
15627,Howard,3," Oh, and potty is okay?",4,Big Bang Theory,23,5
15628,Raj,3, Potty is innocent. Potty is adorable.,4,Big Bang Theory,38,6
15629,Howard,3," What do you do in the potty, wee-wee?",4,Big Bang Theory,38,8
15630,Raj,3, If I don't have to boom-boom.,4,Big Bang Theory,30,6
15631,Sheldon,3, Greetings. You all remember Amy Farrah Fowler.,4,Big Bang Theory,47,7
15632,Leonard,3, Sure.,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
15633,Howard,3, Nice to see you.,4,Big Bang Theory,17,4
15634,Amy,3, Hello.,4,Big Bang Theory,7,1
15635,Sheldon,3, Sorry we're late.,4,Big Bang Theory,18,3
15636,Amy,3, I must take responsibility. I had to stop for feminine hygiene supplies.,4,Big Bang Theory,73,12
15637,Howard,3," Ah, ah.",4,Big Bang Theory,8,2
15638,Leonard,3, Okay.,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
15639,Sheldon,3, I believe she's experiencing her menses.,4,Big Bang Theory,41,6
15640,Amy,3," Actually, I'm not. In order to avoid surprises, I wear them all the time.",4,Big Bang Theory,74,14
15641,Leonard,3," Ah, ah.",4,Big Bang Theory,8,2
15642,Howard,3," Okay. Toilet's sounding pretty good now, huh?",4,Big Bang Theory,46,7
15643,Penny,3," Hey, look, it's Shamy.",4,Big Bang Theory,23,4
15644,Amy,3, Shamy?,4,Big Bang Theory,7,1
15645,Sheldon,3," A juvenile amalgamation of our names. Sheldon and Amy, Shamy.",4,Big Bang Theory,62,10
15646,Amy,3, Oh. I don't like that. Don't do that.,4,Big Bang Theory,38,8
15647,Penny,3, All righty. What's new?,4,Big Bang Theory,24,4
15648,Amy,3," Well, just recently, I learned that you refer to us as Shamy, and I don't like that.",4,Big Bang Theory,85,17
15649,Penny,3," I got it. But what I was going for was, you know, how's your life?",4,Big Bang Theory,67,15
15650,Amy,3," Like everybody else's. Subject to entropy, decay and eventual death. Thank you for asking. Why is she not taking our order?",4,Big Bang Theory,124,21
15651,Sheldon,3," I should've warned you, one has to navigate a labyrinth of social nonsense before one can be fed here.",4,Big Bang Theory,103,19
15652,Amy,3, Really? I assumed an establishment called the Cheesecake Factory would function more efficiently.,4,Big Bang Theory,98,13
15653,Sheldon,3, It's how they lure you in. I believe it's called bait and switch.,4,Big Bang Theory,66,13
15654,Penny,3," Okay, I'm just gonna walk away, 'cause I don't want to be here.",4,Big Bang Theory,64,13
15655,Leonard,3," So, this is nice. First time we've all gotten together to eat.",4,Big Bang Theory,63,12
15656,Amy,3," You're right, he's a festival of humdrum chitchat.",4,Big Bang Theory,51,8
15657,Leonard,3," Okay, that's all I got. Howard, you're up.",4,Big Bang Theory,43,8
15658,Howard,3," Um, tell us about your work, Amy.",4,Big Bang Theory,34,7
15659,Amy,3, I doubt you'd understand. Sheldon tells me you only have a master's degree.,4,Big Bang Theory,76,13
15660,Howard,3," Raj, do you have any questions for Amy?",4,Big Bang Theory,40,8
15661,Amy,3, I'm curious as to why we're not eating alone.,4,Big Bang Theory,46,9
15662,Sheldon,3, They can't function without me. I'm the social glue that holds this little group together. You're welcome.,4,Big Bang Theory,107,17
15664,Leonard,3," Listen, can I talk to you about your girlfriend?",4,Big Bang Theory,49,9
15665,Sheldon,3," She's not my girlfriend. She's a girl and she's my friend, but there's no touching or unsanitary exchange of saliva.",4,Big Bang Theory,117,20
15666,Leonard,3, Got it.,4,Big Bang Theory,8,2
15667,Sheldon,3," Although, for the record, on one occasion, she licked her thumb to remove raspberry jelly from the corner of my mouth. It's an action we both regret to this day.",4,Big Bang Theory,162,30
15668,Leonard,3," Uh-huh. Anyway, I'm not sure she's the best fit for our little, how should we call it, rebel alliance.",4,Big Bang Theory,103,19
15669,Sheldon,3," Oh, I never identified with the rebel alliance. Despite their tendency to build Death Stars, I've always been more of an empire man.",4,Big Bang Theory,133,23
15670,Leonard,3," Yeah, not my point.",4,Big Bang Theory,20,4
15671,Sheldon,3," I know what your point is. You're intimidated by Amy's intellect. To that I say, buck up.",4,Big Bang Theory,90,17
15672,Leonard,3," Okay, let me just get right to it. Amy is judgmental, sanctimonious and frankly just obnoxious.",4,Big Bang Theory,96,16
15673,Sheldon,3, So?,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
15674,Leonard,3, So we already have you for all that.,4,Big Bang Theory,37,8
15675,Sheldon,3, Are you suggesting I terminate my relationship with Amy?,4,Big Bang Theory,57,9
15676,Leonard,3," No, no, of course not. Just have your relationship someplace else.",4,Big Bang Theory,67,11
15677,Sheldon,3," May I point out that for eight long months, I suffered in silence as your female companion filled our apartment with her off-key country music caterwauling, the unappetizing spectacle of her grinding a pumice stone against her calloused feet in our living room, and night after night of uninformative TV documentaries about the Jersey Shore.",4,Big Bang Theory,342,55
15678,Leonard,3, Suffered in silence?,4,Big Bang Theory,21,3
15679,Sheldon,3, Yes. And I'd thank you to do the same.,4,Big Bang Theory,39,9
15680,Leonard,3, Really? Silence?,4,Big Bang Theory,17,2
15682,Raj,3," Ah. Nothing makes beer taste better than cool clear Rocky Mountain spring water. Where are the Rocky Mountains, anyway?",4,Big Bang Theory,120,19
15683,Howard,3, Philadelphia.,4,Big Bang Theory,14,1
15684,Raj,3, Really? I thought they were out West someplace.,4,Big Bang Theory,48,8
15685,Howard,3," Think about it, Raj. Where did the movie Rocky take place?",4,Big Bang Theory,59,11
15686,Raj,3," Philadelphia. Okay, now I get it.",4,Big Bang Theory,34,6
15687,Penny,3," So this is the plan? From now on, we're just gonna hide out in here to avoid the Shamy?",4,Big Bang Theory,88,19
15688,Raj,3," I'm very comfortable here. Penny, dear, why don't you shoot another silver bullet my way?",4,Big Bang Theory,90,15
15689,Penny,3, Get one yourself.,4,Big Bang Theory,18,3
15690,Raj,3," Ooh, somebody's been taking bitchy pills.",4,Big Bang Theory,42,6
15691,Penny,3," God, he's an ass when he drinks.",4,Big Bang Theory,33,7
15692,Howard,3," Oh, he's an ass when he doesn't. You just don't hear it.",4,Big Bang Theory,57,12
15693,Leonard,3, I think we need to start entertaining the possibility that the Shamy could go on for years.,4,Big Bang Theory,92,17
15694,Raj,3," Well, if that's the case, Penny will have to get satellite TV and maybe once a week run a vacuum through this place.",4,Big Bang Theory,117,23
15695,Penny,3, I thought you were going to talk to Sheldon.,4,Big Bang Theory,45,9
15696,Leonard,3, I did.,4,Big Bang Theory,7,2
15697,Penny,3," Well, what'd he say?",4,Big Bang Theory,21,4
15698,Leonard,3," Well, he pointed out that he kinda, sorta had to put up with you.",4,Big Bang Theory,66,14
15699,Penny,3," Kinda, sorta had to?",4,Big Bang Theory,21,4
15700,Leonard,3, I didn't agree with him.,4,Big Bang Theory,25,5
15701,Penny,3," Well, you defended me, right?",4,Big Bang Theory,30,5
15702,Leonard,3," I tried, but  he made a fairly well-reasoned argument.",4,Big Bang Theory,55,9
15703,Howard,3, You're not doing that right.,4,Big Bang Theory,29,5
15704,Penny,3, What?,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
15705,Howard,3, Gimme.,4,Big Bang Theory,7,1
15706,Penny,3, No.,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
15707,Howard,3, Trust me.,4,Big Bang Theory,10,2
15708,Penny,3, No!,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
15709,Howard,3, I do this for my mom all the time. See? With the grain.,4,Big Bang Theory,56,13
15710,Penny,3," Wow, that is better.",4,Big Bang Theory,21,4
15711,Howard,3," And someday, when you have varicose veins, I'll show you how to massage them.",4,Big Bang Theory,78,14
15713,Raj,3," Oh, God, never again.",4,Big Bang Theory,22,4
15714,Leonard,3," I assume by never again, you mean never again will you drink all of Penny's beer, then run down to the gas station for a couple of 40s, a box of Slim Jims and the latest issue of Bombay Badonkadonks.",4,Big Bang Theory,200,40
15715,Raj,3, I was homesick.,4,Big Bang Theory,16,3
15716,Howard,3, The highlight of the evening was when you showed us your Bollywood break dancing skills. ,4,Big Bang Theory,90,15
15717,Raj,3, That's very offensive.,4,Big Bang Theory,23,3
15718,Howard,3," Yeah, we all thought so.",4,Big Bang Theory,25,5
15719,Leonard,3," Oh, no.",4,Big Bang Theory,8,2
15720,Howard,3, What?,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
15721,Leonard,3, John and Yoko.,4,Big Bang Theory,15,3
15722,Howard,3, More like Yoko and Yoko.,4,Big Bang Theory,25,5
15723,Sheldon,3, Greetings.,4,Big Bang Theory,11,1
15724,Leonard,3, Hey.,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
15725,Sheldon,3, I brought Amy here to show her some of the work I'm doing.,4,Big Bang Theory,59,13
15726,Amy,3," It's very impressive, for theoretical work.",4,Big Bang Theory,44,6
15727,Sheldon,3, Do I detect a hint of condescension?,4,Big Bang Theory,37,7
15728,Amy,3," I'm sorry, was I being too subtle? I meant compared to the real-world applications of neurobiology, theoretical physics is, what's the word I'm looking for? Hmm, cute.",4,Big Bang Theory,168,27
15730,Sheldon,3, Are you suggesting the work of a neurobiologist like Babinski could ever rise to the significance of a physicist like Clarke-Maxwell or Dirac?,4,Big Bang Theory,143,23
15731,Amy,3, I'm stating it outright. Babinski eats Dirac for breakfast and defecates Clarke-Maxwell.,4,Big Bang Theory,89,12
15732,Sheldon,3, You take that back.,4,Big Bang Theory,20,4
15733,Amy,3," Absolutely not. My colleagues and I are mapping the neurological substrates that subserve global information processing, which is required for all cognitive reasoning, including scientific inquiry, making my research ipso facto prior in the ordo cognoscendi. That means it's better than his research, and by extension, of course, yours.",4,Big Bang Theory,337,49
15734,Leonard,3," I'm sorry, I'm-I'm still trying to work on the defecating Clark Maxwell, so",4,Big Bang Theory,76,13
15735,Sheldon,3," Excuse me, but a grand unified theory, insofar as it explains everything, will ipso facto explain neurobiology.",4,Big Bang Theory,112,17
15736,Amy,3," Yes, but if I'm successful, I will be able to map and reproduce your thought processes in deriving a grand unified theory, and therefore, subsume your conclusions under my paradigm.",4,Big Bang Theory,182,30
15737,Sheldon,3," That's the rankest psychologism, and was conclusively revealed as hogwash by Gottlob Frege in the 1890s!",4,Big Bang Theory,105,16
15738,Amy,3, We appear to have reached an impasse.,4,Big Bang Theory,38,7
15739,Sheldon,3, I agree. I move our relationship terminate immediately.,4,Big Bang Theory,56,8
15740,Amy,3, Seconded.,4,Big Bang Theory,10,1
15741,Sheldon,3, There being no objections,4,Big Bang Theory,26,4
15743,Sheldon,3," The motion carries. Good day, Amy Farrah Fowler.",4,Big Bang Theory,49,8
15744,Amy,3," Good day, Sheldon Cooper.",4,Big Bang Theory,26,4
15745,Howard,3," Women, huh? Can't live with them, can't successfully refute their hypotheses.",4,Big Bang Theory,78,11
15746,Sheldon,3, Amen to that.,4,Big Bang Theory,14,3
15748,Penny,3," Hey, Sheldon.",4,Big Bang Theory,14,2
15749,Sheldon,3, Hello.,4,Big Bang Theory,7,1
15750,Penny,3, I hear you broke up with Amy.,4,Big Bang Theory,30,7
15751,Sheldon,3, A breakup would imply she was my girlfriend. She was a girl who was my friend who is now a girl who is not my friend.,4,Big Bang Theory,118,26
15752,Penny,3," Wow. That's like the worst country song ever. So, how are you doing?",4,Big Bang Theory,69,13
15753,Sheldon,3, Regarding what?,4,Big Bang Theory,16,2
15754,Penny,3, Amy.,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
15755,Sheldon,3, I don't follow.,4,Big Bang Theory,16,3
15756,Penny,3," Well, breakups, or whatever the hell this is, can be tough.",4,Big Bang Theory,60,11
15757,Sheldon,3," Penny, I assure you, I'm fine. My relationship with Amy was purely intellectual. There were no emotional bonds, the severing of which would cause me any discomfort. The relationship simply outlived its utility, and I'm continuing on with my life as before.",4,Big Bang Theory,257,42
15758,Penny,3, Okay. Good.,4,Big Bang Theory,12,2
15759,Sheldon,3," Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to buy a pussycat.",4,Big Bang Theory,53,11
15761,Leonard,3," I gotta tell you guys, I'm a little worried about Sheldon.",4,Big Bang Theory,59,11
15762,Howard,3, We're all a little worried about Sheldon.,4,Big Bang Theory,42,7
15763,Leonard,3," No, I mean since the Shamy hit a reef.",4,Big Bang Theory,39,9
15764,Howard,3," Oh, I thought you were just making a generalization, you know, I'm worried about Sheldon someday setting off a low-yield nuclear device because the cafeteria ran out of lime Jell-O.",4,Big Bang Theory,182,30
15765,Raj,3, What does hit a reef mean?,4,Big Bang Theory,27,6
15766,Leonard,3," Uh, went splitsville.",4,Big Bang Theory,22,3
15767,Raj,3, Pardon?,4,Big Bang Theory,8,1
15768,Leonard,3, Turned to boom-boom.,4,Big Bang Theory,21,3
15769,Raj,3, Ah.,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
15770,Leonard,3, I think Sheldon really misses Amy.,4,Big Bang Theory,35,6
15771,Howard,3, You should lend him your copy of Bombay Badonkadonks.,4,Big Bang Theory,54,9
15772,Leonard,3, He got a cat to keep him company.,4,Big Bang Theory,34,8
15773,Raj,3, You're kidding.,4,Big Bang Theory,16,2
15774,Leonard,3," He takes it everywhere, to bed, to the bathroom.",4,Big Bang Theory,49,9
15775,Raj,3, He takes the kitty to the potty?,4,Big Bang Theory,33,7
15776,Howard,3, I thought we discussed the P-word.,4,Big Bang Theory,35,6
15777,Raj,3," Don't try to change me, dude. I am what I am.",4,Big Bang Theory,46,11
15778,Sheldon,3," Oh, gentlemen.",4,Big Bang Theory,15,2
15779,Howard,3, Hey. Aren't you going to introduce us to your little friend?,4,Big Bang Theory,61,11
15780,Sheldon,3," My apologies. Raj, Howard, I'd like you to meet Dr. Robert Oppenheimer.",4,Big Bang Theory,72,12
15781,Howard,3, Hello.,4,Big Bang Theory,7,1
15782,Raj,3, Hi.,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
15783,Sheldon,3," Now, if you'll excuse me, the father of the atomic bomb wants a saucer of milk.",4,Big Bang Theory,80,16
15784,Howard,3," Okay, I get it. We're worried about Sheldon.",4,Big Bang Theory,45,8
15785,Leonard,3, Yeah.,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
15787,Leonard,3," Hey.  Oh, no.",4,Big Bang Theory,14,3
15788,Sheldon,3, Robert Oppenheimer was lonely.,4,Big Bang Theory,31,4
15789,Leonard,3, So you decided to get the whole Manhattan Project?,4,Big Bang Theory,51,9
15790,Sheldon,3," Yes. This is Enrico Fermi, Richard Feynman, Edward Teller, Otto Frisch, and Zazzles.",4,Big Bang Theory,85,13
15791,Leonard,3, Zazzles?,4,Big Bang Theory,9,1
15792,Sheldon,3," I was going to name him Herman von Helmholtz, but he's so zazzy.",4,Big Bang Theory,65,13
15793,Leonard,3," Okay, we need to talk.",4,Big Bang Theory,23,5
15794,Sheldon,3, About what?,4,Big Bang Theory,12,2
15795,Leonard,3," Cats, Sheldon. You're clearly upset about Amy being gone, and you're trying to replace her with a bunch of cats.",4,Big Bang Theory,113,20
15796,Sheldon,3, Clowder.,4,Big Bang Theory,9,1
15797,Leonard,3, What?,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
15798,Sheldon,3, A group of cats is a clowder. Or a glaring.,4,Big Bang Theory,44,10
15799,Leonard,3," Okay, yeah, fine.",4,Big Bang Theory,18,3
15800,Sheldon,3, It's the kind of thing you ought to know now that we have one.,4,Big Bang Theory,63,14
15801,Leonard,3, Terrific. My-my point is you need to face up to what you're feeling with this breakup.,4,Big Bang Theory,87,16
15802,Sheldon,3, It wasn't a breakup. A breakup would imply that Amy was my girlfriend.,4,Big Bang Theory,71,13
15803,Leonard,3," Okay, I got it, I got it, she's not your girlfriend. Now listen to me. I know about loneliness. I know about trying to replace someone with other stuff. When I broke up with Penny, I got back into my cello, I built a bunch of model rockets, I got those weightlifting gloves and that five-pound dumbbell.",4,Big Bang Theory,304,57
15804,Sheldon,3," You didn't break up, she dumped you.",4,Big Bang Theory,37,7
15805,Leonard,3, She didn't dump me. It was mutual!,4,Big Bang Theory,35,7
15806,Sheldon,3, I was there. She dumped you.,4,Big Bang Theory,29,6
15807,Leonard,3," Okay, fine. Live with cats. Be like my Aunt Nancy. She had dozens of them. And do you know what happened after she died? They ate her.",4,Big Bang Theory,135,27
15808,Sheldon,3," You don't have to sell me on cats, Leonard. I'm already a fan. All right, fellas, who's in the mood for Fancy Feast? Well, that's not fancy at all.",4,Big Bang Theory,148,29
15810,Leonard,3," Hi, Mrs. Cooper. Thanks for coming.",4,Big Bang Theory,36,6
15812,Leonard,3, He's in his bedroom.,4,Big Bang Theory,21,4
15814,Leonard,3," No, she's real.",4,Big Bang Theory,16,3
15816,Leonard,3," No, no, it's not like that. It's, uh, I don't know what it's like. But there is something I should prepare you for.",4,Big Bang Theory,116,23
15818,Leonard,3, Hold on to that thought. ,4,Big Bang Theory,26,5
15819,Sheldon,3, Come in. ,4,Big Bang Theory,10,2
15820,Leonard,3, Surprise.,4,Big Bang Theory,10,1
15821,Sheldon,3," Mom, what an unexpected pleasure.",4,Big Bang Theory,34,5
15823,Sheldon,3," I'd like you to meet Oppenheimer, Frisch, Panofsky, Feynman, Weisskopf",4,Big Bang Theory,71,10
15825,Sheldon,3, What are you doing here?,4,Big Bang Theory,25,5
15827,Sheldon,3," Oh, that's preposterous. I'm not pining over anyone.",4,Big Bang Theory,53,8
15829,Sheldon,3," I do not agree. Cats make wonderful companions. They don't argue or question my intellectual authority, and this little guy here, I think you'll find to be quite zazzy.",4,Big Bang Theory,169,29
15833,Sheldon,3, Coming!,4,Big Bang Theory,8,1
15835,Sheldon,3, Aw. What is she doing here?,4,Big Bang Theory,28,6
15837,Amy,3," Your mother thinks you might be losing your mind over me. As a neurobiologist, I was curious.",4,Big Bang Theory,94,17
15838,Sheldon,3," Well, rest assured, I am in full possession of my faculties.",4,Big Bang Theory,61,11
15839,Leonard,3, 25 cats!,4,Big Bang Theory,9,2
15841,Sheldon,3," All right, but you're not fooling me. Whenever you say we have to talk, it means you want me to listen.",4,Big Bang Theory,104,21
15843,Sheldon,3," Yes, ma'am.",4,Big Bang Theory,12,2
15845,Sheldon,3," That's a peculiar conclusion. By any standard, Amy is more similar to me than anyone I've ever met.",4,Big Bang Theory,100,18
15847,Sheldon,3," Well, whether you see it or not is irrelevant. I can't see subatomic particles, but nevertheless, they're there.",4,Big Bang Theory,113,18
15848,Amy,3, Excellent point.,4,Big Bang Theory,17,2
15849,Sheldon,3, A physics point.,4,Big Bang Theory,17,3
15850,Amy,3, Touche.,4,Big Bang Theory,8,1
15852,Sheldon,3," Amy, after consideration, I believe we may have acted rashly. I propose we resume our relationship and attempt to resolve our differences.",4,Big Bang Theory,139,22
15853,Amy,3, I'll agree to that only if you'll stipulate that 80% of our difficulties were caused by you.,4,Big Bang Theory,93,17
15854,Sheldon,3, I'll go as high as 40.,4,Big Bang Theory,23,6
15855,Amy,3, Sixty-five.,4,Big Bang Theory,12,1
15856,Sheldon,3," Done. You understand that moving forward, we deal with the fact that my mother does not approve of you?",4,Big Bang Theory,104,19
15857,Amy,3, I do. I find being cast in the role of bad girl oddly titillating.,4,Big Bang Theory,67,14
15858,Sheldon,3, Would you like to see my cats?,4,Big Bang Theory,31,7
15859,Amy,3, I would. I love cats. They're the epitome of indifference.,4,Big Bang Theory,59,10
15860,Sheldon,3," Ah, then you may find Zazzles a little cloying.",4,Big Bang Theory,48,9
15861,Leonard,3, I saw what you did there.,4,Big Bang Theory,26,6
15863,Leonard,3," No, no, no, I can do it.",4,Big Bang Theory,25,7
15866,Sheldon,3," Thank you, Amy. Here's your cat. And here's your $20.",4,Big Bang Theory,54,10
15867,Amy,3, Next!,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
15868,Sheldon,3," Thank you, Amy. Here's your cat. And here's your $20.",4,Big Bang Theory,54,10
15869,Amy,3, Next!,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
15871,Raj,4," I'm telling you, if xenon emits ultraviolet light, then those dark matter discoveries must be wrong.",4,Big Bang Theory,101,16
15872,Sheldon,4," Yes, well, if we lived in a world where slow-moving xenon produced light, then you'd be correct. Also, pigs would fly, my derriere would produce cotton candy, and The Phantom Menace would be a timeless classic.",4,Big Bang Theory,211,36
15873,Raj,4," Oh, you're so arrogant. If you were a superhero, your name would be Captain Arrogant. And you know what your superpower would be? Arrogance.",4,Big Bang Theory,141,24
15874,Sheldon,4," You're wrong again. If my superpower were arrogance, my name would be Dr. Arroganto.",4,Big Bang Theory,85,14
15875,Howard,4, I love watching Raj and Sheldon try to work together.,4,Big Bang Theory,54,10
15876,Leonard,4," Yeah, it's like if Alien and Predator decided to go partners in a Jamba Juice.",4,Big Bang Theory,79,15
15877,Raj,4, Has it occurred to you you're missing the big picture? If you look at neutron scattering data,4,Big Bang Theory,94,17
15878,Sheldon,4," Oh, Penny? Penny?",4,Big Bang Theory,18,3
15879,Penny,4, What's up?,4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
15880,Sheldon,4, Nothing. I just wanted to make Raj stop talking.,4,Big Bang Theory,49,9
15881,Howard,4," No, no, no. He won. Suck it up.",4,Big Bang Theory,32,8
15882,Penny,4," Well, I'd ask you guys if you want dessert, but I know Sheldon doesn't eat dessert on Tuesdays. And even if Raj wanted something, he couldn't tell me. Howard won't order anything, but he will come up with some sort of skeevy comment involving the words pie or cheesecake. And Leonard's lactose intolerant, so he can't eat anything here without his intestines blowing up like a balloon animal.",4,Big Bang Theory,393,68
15883,Leonard,4, Hang on a second. I could have the fruit platter.,4,Big Bang Theory,50,10
15884,Penny,4, You want the fruit platter?,4,Big Bang Theory,28,5
15885,Leonard,4, Does it have melon on it?,4,Big Bang Theory,26,6
15886,Penny,4, Yeah.,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
15887,Leonard,4," No, I can't eat melon.",4,Big Bang Theory,23,5
15888,Penny,4," Oh, Howard, heads up. Your ex-girlfriend just came in for her shift.",4,Big Bang Theory,69,12
15889,Leonard,4, When was the last time you saw her?,4,Big Bang Theory,36,8
15890,Howard,4," Oh, not since we broke up. Wow. How am I going to play this? Sophisticated and relaxed? Friendly, noncommittal? Cold and distant? .",4,Big Bang Theory,132,23
15892,Leonard,4, Hey.,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
15893,Sheldon,4, Hello. I see you decided to go with pathetic and frightened.,4,Big Bang Theory,61,11
15894,Raj,4, It's one of his best moves.,4,Big Bang Theory,28,6
15896,Howard,4," So, my dear, we meet again.",4,Big Bang Theory,28,6
15898,Howard,4," I've missed you, Katee Sackhoff.",4,Big Bang Theory,33,5
15900,Howard,4, Anything.,4,Big Bang Theory,10,1
15902,Howard,4," Why are you in bed with me? If we start to question this, it all falls apart.",4,Big Bang Theory,78,17
15904,Howard,4," Okay, if you insist.",4,Big Bang Theory,21,4
15906,Howard,4," No, Ma!",4,Big Bang Theory,8,2
15908,Howard,4," Maybe it committed suicide! Leave me alone! Now, where were we?",4,Big Bang Theory,64,11
15910,Howard,4, Bernadette? What are you doing here?,4,Big Bang Theory,37,6
15912,Howard,4," No, I'm not.",4,Big Bang Theory,13,3
15914,Howard,4," Okay, I'm a little confused here.",4,Big Bang Theory,34,6
15916,Howard,4, Not that kind of confused.,4,Big Bang Theory,27,5
15919,Howard,4," No, of course not.",4,Big Bang Theory,19,4
15924,Howard,4," Wait. Katee, why are you leaving?",4,Big Bang Theory,34,6
15927,Howard,4," Great, Ma!",4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
15929,Howard,4," And with that mental picture, I think we're done for the evening.",4,Big Bang Theory,66,12
15931,Leonard,4," You know, you never told me what happened between you and Bernadette.",4,Big Bang Theory,70,12
15932,Howard,4, I did a stupid thing.,4,Big Bang Theory,22,5
15933,Leonard,4," Yeah, I guessed that.",4,Big Bang Theory,22,4
15934,Howard,4, It was the kind of thing that makes it kind of hard to face her now.,4,Big Bang Theory,69,16
15935,Leonard,4," That covers anything from farting in bed to killing a homeless guy. Oh, my God. You ran over a hobo.",4,Big Bang Theory,101,20
15936,Howard,4, No. Stop asking.,4,Big Bang Theory,17,3
15937,Leonard,4," All right, fine. So you want to get back together with her, but you're too ashamed to face her because of whatever it is you did.",4,Big Bang Theory,130,26
15938,Howard,4, In a nutshell.,4,Big Bang Theory,15,3
15939,Leonard,4," Okay. Well, how about this? Kidnap Bernadette from the opera wearing a creepy mask so she doesn't know it's you.",4,Big Bang Theory,113,20
15940,Howard,4," Now, you see, I don't know if you're kidding or not.",4,Big Bang Theory,53,11
15941,Raj,4, You're being unreasonable. Why can't I have a desk?,4,Big Bang Theory,52,9
15942,Sheldon,4, Our collaboration is a work of the mind. We don't need desks.,4,Big Bang Theory,62,12
15943,Raj,4, You have a desk.,4,Big Bang Theory,17,4
15944,Sheldon,4, Correct.,4,Big Bang Theory,9,1
15945,Raj,4, But I can't have one.,4,Big Bang Theory,22,5
15946,Sheldon,4, You're two for two.,4,Big Bang Theory,20,4
15947,Leonard,4," Why can't he have a desk, Sheldon?",4,Big Bang Theory,35,7
15948,Sheldon,4," Oh, Lord, will this day never end? As I've explained repeatedly to Dr. Koothrappali, whose ability to comprehend the American idiom fails him when it's convenient, there's absolutely no money in my budget for additional office furniture.",4,Big Bang Theory,238,37
15949,Raj,4," Oh, but there's money for a drawer full of Red Vines, a marshmallow shooting rifle, and a super executive ant farm with glow-in-the-dark sand?",4,Big Bang Theory,143,24
15950,Sheldon,4, Yes.,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
15951,Howard,4," Okay, what if he buys his own desk?",4,Big Bang Theory,36,8
15952,Raj,4," Yeah, what if I buy my own desk?",4,Big Bang Theory,33,8
15953,Sheldon,4, That's ridiculous.,4,Big Bang Theory,19,2
15954,Howard,4, Why?,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
15955,Sheldon,4, Because,4,Big Bang Theory,8,1
15956,Raj,4, Yes?,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
15957,Sheldon,4, It's my office.,4,Big Bang Theory,16,3
15958,Leonard,4, Sheldon.,4,Big Bang Theory,9,1
15959,Sheldon,4," All right, all right. He can buy his own desk.",4,Big Bang Theory,47,10
15960,Raj,4, And I can put it in your office?,4,Big Bang Theory,33,8
15961,Sheldon,4," Well, you really want to dot the I's and cross the T's, don't you?",4,Big Bang Theory,67,14
15962,Leonard,4, Why would you want a glow-in-the-dark ant farm?,4,Big Bang Theory,48,8
15963,Sheldon,4, They do some of their best work at night.,4,Big Bang Theory,42,9
15965,Penny,4," Ah, it's okay.",4,Big Bang Theory,15,3
15966,Sheldon,4,  Penny?  Penny?  Penny?  Penny?,4,Big Bang Theory,32,4
15967,Howard,4, Would you have opened the door if you knew it was me?,4,Big Bang Theory,54,12
15968,Penny,4, Not since I found out the teddy bear you gave me had a webcam in it.,4,Big Bang Theory,69,16
15969,Howard,4, I just have a question. Does Bernadette ever talk about me?,4,Big Bang Theory,60,11
15970,Penny,4," Oh, absolutely.",4,Big Bang Theory,16,2
15971,Howard,4, She does?,4,Big Bang Theory,10,2
15972,Penny,4," Yeah, sure. Just yesterday, she asked, why is Howard hiding under the table?",4,Big Bang Theory,77,13
15973,Howard,4," She saw that, huh?",4,Big Bang Theory,19,4
15974,Penny,4," Oh, no, not at first. Right after I pointed it out.",4,Big Bang Theory,52,11
15975,Howard,4, Let me ask you something else. Is she seeing anybody?,4,Big Bang Theory,54,10
15976,Penny,4," Uh, not that I know of. Hey, while we're on the subject, why did you guys break up anyway?",4,Big Bang Theory,91,19
15977,Howard,4," Oh, I'd rather not say.",4,Big Bang Theory,24,5
15978,Penny,4," Howard, if you want my help, I've got to know what happened.",4,Big Bang Theory,61,12
15979,Howard,4, But it's embarrassing.,4,Big Bang Theory,23,3
15980,Penny,4," Yeah, that's what I'm counting on. Spill.",4,Big Bang Theory,42,7
15981,Howard,4," Okay. Well, you know World of Warcraft?",4,Big Bang Theory,40,7
15982,Penny,4," Um, the online game? Sure.",4,Big Bang Theory,27,5
15983,Howard,4," Well, did you know that the characters in the game can have sex with each other?",4,Big Bang Theory,81,16
15984,Penny,4," Oh, God. I think I see where this is going.",4,Big Bang Theory,44,10
15985,Howard,4, Her name was Glissinda the Troll. Bernadette walked in on me while we were doing the cyber-nasty under the Bridge of Souls.,4,Big Bang Theory,124,22
15986,Penny,4," Oh, you're right. That is so embarrassing.",4,Big Bang Theory,43,7
15987,Howard,4, Would you talk to her?,4,Big Bang Theory,23,5
15988,Penny,4, Bernadette or the troll?,4,Big Bang Theory,25,4
15989,Howard,4," Bernadette. She was so mad at me, she wouldn't even listen to my side of the story.",4,Big Bang Theory,84,17
15990,Penny,4," Well, what was your side?",4,Big Bang Theory,26,5
15991,Howard,4," Well, for all we know, Glissinda the Troll wasn't even a real woman. I mean, she could've been a 50-year-old truck driver in New Jersey.",4,Big Bang Theory,137,25
15992,Penny,4, Really? And that didn't make her feel better?,4,Big Bang Theory,46,8
15993,Howard,4," Will you talk to her, see if there's any chance at all we could get back together?",4,Big Bang Theory,83,17
15994,Penny,4," Oh, gee, Howard, I really don't want to get in the middle of this.",4,Big Bang Theory,67,14
15995,Howard,4," No. Why would you? I'm just another lonely nerd, living with his mother, trying to find any scrap of happiness he can. You know, maybe to make up for the fact that his dad left him when he was 11.",4,Big Bang Theory,197,40
15996,Penny,4," Okay, I will think about it.",4,Big Bang Theory,29,6
15997,Howard,4," You know, I've always blamed myself for him leaving. I always thought it was because I wasn't the son he wanted.",4,Big Bang Theory,113,21
15998,Penny,4," Yeah, I said I'd think about it.",4,Big Bang Theory,33,7
15999,Howard,4," I wasn't athletic, yeah, I was kind of sickly.",4,Big Bang Theory,47,9
16000,Penny,4," Okay, fine. Look, look, I'm calling her now! See?",4,Big Bang Theory,50,9
16001,Howard,4, Thank you.,4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
16003,Leonard,4," So anyway, Howard asked Penny to talk to Bernadette, and she did, and Bernadette agreed to meet him for a cup of coffee.",4,Big Bang Theory,121,23
16004,Sheldon,4, One question.,4,Big Bang Theory,14,2
16005,Leonard,4, Yeah?,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
16006,Sheldon,4, Why on earth are you telling me all this?,4,Big Bang Theory,42,9
16007,Leonard,4," I don't know. Sometimes your movements are so lifelike, I forget you're not a real boy.",4,Big Bang Theory,88,16
16008,Raj,4, You said I could buy a desk.,4,Big Bang Theory,29,7
16009,Sheldon,4, This isn't a desk. This is a Brobdingnagian monstrosity.,4,Big Bang Theory,57,9
16010,Raj,4," Is that the American idiom for giant, big-ass desk?",4,Big Bang Theory,52,9
16011,Sheldon,4, It's actually British.,4,Big Bang Theory,23,3
16012,Raj,4, Can you say it again for me?,4,Big Bang Theory,29,7
16013,Sheldon,4, Brobdingnagian.,4,Big Bang Theory,16,1
16014,Raj,4, One more time?,4,Big Bang Theory,15,3
16015,Sheldon,4, Brobdingnagian.,4,Big Bang Theory,16,1
16016,Raj,4, Now three times fast?,4,Big Bang Theory,22,4
16017,Sheldon,4," Brobdingnagian, Brobdingna How did you even get it in here?",4,Big Bang Theory,60,10
16018,Raj,4," That's for me, Ramon, Julio, Jesus and Rodrigo to know and you to find out.",4,Big Bang Theory,76,15
16019,Sheldon,4," All right, you've made your point. A fine prank, very amusing. Now get it out.",4,Big Bang Theory,79,15
16020,Raj,4, No.,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
16021,Sheldon,4, Yes.,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
16022,Raj,4, No.,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
16023,Sheldon,4, Yes.,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
16024,Raj,4, No.,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
16025,Sheldon,4, Yes.,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
16026,Raj,4," I have three brothers and two sisters, Sheldon, I can do this all day.",4,Big Bang Theory,71,14
16027,Sheldon,4," All right, if you're not going to remove it, I'll remove it for you.",4,Big Bang Theory,69,14
16028,Raj,4, Knock yourself out.,4,Big Bang Theory,20,3
16029,Sheldon,4, Help me move my desk.,4,Big Bang Theory,22,5
16030,Raj,4, No.,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
16031,Sheldon,4, Yes.,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
16032,Raj,4, No.,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
16033,Sheldon,4, Yes.,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
16034,Raj,4, No. It's too Brobdingnagian.,4,Big Bang Theory,29,4
16035,Sheldon,4, Why do you even want this here? Its size is completely disproportionate to its purpose.,4,Big Bang Theory,88,15
16036,Raj,4," Well, seeing as its purpose was to piss you off, I'd say it's spot-on.",4,Big Bang Theory,71,14
16037,Sheldon,4," All right, I see what's going on. This is the opening salvo in what will be an escalating series of juvenile tit-for-tat exchanges. Well titted.",4,Big Bang Theory,145,25
16038,Raj,4, Thank you.,4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
16039,Sheldon,4, Stand by for my upcoming tat.,4,Big Bang Theory,30,6
16040,Raj,4," Hey, Sheldon?",4,Big Bang Theory,14,2
16041,Sheldon,4, Yes?,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
16042,Raj,4, No. See what I did there? I turned it around.,4,Big Bang Theory,46,10
16045,Howard,4," Oh, no, that's okay. How have you been?",4,Big Bang Theory,40,8
16047,Howard,4," Same. I took a scuba-diving course over the summer, but it turns out I'm terrified of the ocean.",4,Big Bang Theory,97,18
16049,Howard,4," You wouldn't know anybody who wants to buy a wet suit, boy's large? Yeah, forget it. Not important. So, are you seeing anyone?",4,Big Bang Theory,127,23
16051,Penny,4," Hey, how are we doing over here? Can I get you something to drink?",4,Big Bang Theory,67,14
16052,Howard,4," Not for me, thanks.",4,Big Bang Theory,20,4
16054,Penny,4, Are you gonna want to order food?,4,Big Bang Theory,34,7
16055,Howard,4, Maybe later.,4,Big Bang Theory,13,2
16056,Penny,4, Okay.,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
16057,Howard,4," So, are you seeing anybody?",4,Big Bang Theory,28,5
16059,Penny,4, That's what I told him when he asked me. I hope that's not out of line.,4,Big Bang Theory,72,16
16061,Howard,4," Penny, can we have a little privacy?",4,Big Bang Theory,37,7
16062,Penny,4, Oh. I'm sorry.,4,Big Bang Theory,15,3
16064,Howard,4," Well, you know how it is with guys. I mean, we have needs and",4,Big Bang Theory,62,14
16066,Howard,4," Well, not real girls.",4,Big Bang Theory,22,4
16068,Penny,4," You know, you look thirsty. I brought you some iced tea.",4,Big Bang Theory,57,11
16070,Penny,4," It's passion fruit, new on the menu.",4,Big Bang Theory,37,7
16071,Howard,4, Isn't there somewhere else you can be?,4,Big Bang Theory,39,7
16072,Penny,4, Not where I can hear you guys.,4,Big Bang Theory,31,7
16073,Howard,4," Okay, fine. I'll admit, there are dark, sordid little corners of the Internet where the name Wolowizard is whispered in hushed tones. But the only reason I go there, the only reason I've ever gone there is because I don't have a real woman in my life. You happy?",4,Big Bang Theory,263,49
16074,Penny,4," Yeah, that'll hold me for a while.",4,Big Bang Theory,35,7
16076,Howard,4," Yeah, but we weren't, I-I mean, you and I never",4,Big Bang Theory,48,10
16078,Howard,4, Yeah.,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
16080,Penny,4, Complimentary nachos! You enjoy. Never had sex? Wow.,4,Big Bang Theory,53,8
16081,Howard,4," What do you mean, whose fault was that?",4,Big Bang Theory,40,8
16083,Howard,4, I didn't think you wanted me to make the move.,4,Big Bang Theory,47,10
16085,Howard,4, Really?,4,Big Bang Theory,8,1
16087,Howard,4, Son of a bitch.,4,Big Bang Theory,16,4
16088,Penny,4," Hey, this is a little awkward, but my manager says I can't actually give nachos away. So, just take that when you're ready.",4,Big Bang Theory,124,23
16090,Howard,4," Yeah, we had a really great talk, and we're gonna start seeing each other again.",4,Big Bang Theory,81,15
16091,Leonard,4," Oh, congratulations. Have you broken it to the troll yet?",4,Big Bang Theory,58,10
16092,Howard,4, Did Penny tell you about that?,4,Big Bang Theory,31,6
16093,Leonard,4, No. Steve Patterson told me.,4,Big Bang Theory,29,5
16094,Howard,4, The greasy old fat guy in Facilities Management?,4,Big Bang Theory,49,8
16095,Leonard,4, Yeah.,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
16096,Howard,4, How'd he know about it?,4,Big Bang Theory,24,5
16097,Leonard,4, He's Glissinda the troll.,4,Big Bang Theory,26,4
16098,Raj,4," Sorry, dude, the thermostat's on my side of the room, so it stays Mumbai hot in here until you turn off that stupid Indian music!",4,Big Bang Theory,130,25
16099,Sheldon,4, I'll turn off the music when you get rid of that salmonella-ridden parakeet!,4,Big Bang Theory,77,13
16100,Raj,4," Oh, too bad! Sheldon's pathologically afraid of birds! Hey, look, Sheldon! Birdie, birdie, birdie!",4,Big Bang Theory,99,14
16101,Sheldon,4, That's it! Prepare for marshmallow death!,4,Big Bang Theory,42,6
16102,Raj,4, Eat flaming Nerf! ,4,Big Bang Theory,19,3
16103,Leonard,4," So anyway, that's great news about you and Bernadette.",4,Big Bang Theory,55,9
16104,Howard,4, Yeah. I think I'm gonna take her to miniature golf.,4,Big Bang Theory,52,10
16105,Leonard,4," Ah. Well, I guess for you guys that's like regular golf.",4,Big Bang Theory,57,11
16106,Howard,4," Short jokes? Really? You're, like, a quarter of an inch taller than me.",4,Big Bang Theory,72,13
16107,Leonard,4," Yeah, and don't you forget it.",4,Big Bang Theory,31,6
16109,Howard,4, I had a good time.,4,Big Bang Theory,19,5
16121,Howard,4," You said, well, the move, remember?",4,Big Bang Theory,36,6
16123,Howard,4," No, you don't. It's me. The lusty charmer with the fancy patter and the hoochie pants.",4,Big Bang Theory,87,16
16127,Leonard,4," Oh, God, what's that smell? . Oh-ho-hoo!",4,Big Bang Theory,41,7
16128,Sheldon,4, Yes?,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
16129,Leonard,4, What are you doing in there?,4,Big Bang Theory,29,6
16130,Sheldon,4, I'm making hydrogen sulphide and ammonia gas. Just a little experiment in pest control.,4,Big Bang Theory,88,14
16131,Raj,4," It's not gonna work, dude, I grew up in India, an entire subcontinent where cows walk in the street, and nobody has ever had a solid bowel movement.",4,Big Bang Theory,149,28
16132,Sheldon,4," Well, we'll just see how long you can hold out.",4,Big Bang Theory,48,10
16133,Raj,4," Well, we'll just see how your noxious gas fares against my cinnamon-apple-scented aroma therapy candles.",4,Big Bang Theory,105,15
16134,Leonard,4, Didn't you say you're making hydrogen sulphide gas?,4,Big Bang Theory,52,8
16135,Sheldon,4, Yes.,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
16136,Leonard,4, Isn't that flammable?,4,Big Bang Theory,22,3
16137,Sheldon,4," Highly. Oh, dear. ",4,Big Bang Theory,19,3
16138,Raj,4, This is not over.,4,Big Bang Theory,18,4
16140,Leonard,5," All I'm saying is, if they took all the money they spent trying to make a decent Hulk movie, they could probably just make an actual Hulk.",4,Big Bang Theory,139,27
16141,Sheldon,5, That is apt and amusing. I think I shall share that with Amy Farrah Fowler. She'll appreciate the witticism.,4,Big Bang Theory,109,19
16142,Leonard,5, Thank you.,4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
16143,Sheldon,5, It'll also help improve her initial impression of you.,4,Big Bang Theory,55,9
16144,Leonard,5, So what's going on with you two?,4,Big Bang Theory,33,7
16145,Sheldon,5," Well, the status is as it always was. She's a girl. She's a friend. She is not my, please forgive me for doing this, girlfriend.",4,Big Bang Theory,129,25
16146,Leonard,5," Right, right. So you're still just texting and emailing? You don't feel any need to hang out with her, you know, be in the same room?",4,Big Bang Theory,134,26
16147,Sheldon,5," Leonard, you are my best friend. I've known you for seven years, and I can barely tolerate sitting on the couch with you. Imagine my attitude regarding prolonged physical proximity to Amy Farrah Fowler.",4,Big Bang Theory,203,34
16148,Leonard,5, Got it.,4,Big Bang Theory,8,2
16149,Sheldon,5, I sense judgment on your part.,4,Big Bang Theory,31,6
16150,Leonard,5," No, no. Maybe a little.",4,Big Bang Theory,24,5
16151,Sheldon,5, May I suggest that your criticism is based on jealousy.,4,Big Bang Theory,56,10
16152,Leonard,5, Jealousy? What do I have to be jealous of?,4,Big Bang Theory,43,9
16153,Sheldon,5, I have a functioning and satisfying relationship with a female. You have none.,4,Big Bang Theory,79,13
16154,Leonard,5," Oh, right. That.",4,Big Bang Theory,17,3
16155,Sheldon,5," Jealousy is an ugly green-eyed monster, not unlike the Hulk, who, by the way, also has a girlfriend. In this iteration, Jennifer Connelly, whom you may recall as the girlfriend of Russell Crowe in A Beautiful Mind, a feel-good romp if there ever was one.",4,Big Bang Theory,255,45
16156,Leonard,5, I'm not jealous.,4,Big Bang Theory,17,3
16157,Sheldon,5, Hu-u-urgh! Leonard not jealous.,4,Big Bang Theory,32,4
16159,Sheldon,5," You know, it just occurred to me, if there are an infinite number of parallel universes, in one of them, there's probably a Sheldon who doesn't believe parallel universes exist.",4,Big Bang Theory,178,30
16160,Leonard,5, Probably. What's your point?,4,Big Bang Theory,29,4
16161,Sheldon,5," No point. It's just one of the things that makes one of the mes chuckle. What makes you chuckle, Leonard?",4,Big Bang Theory,106,20
16162,Leonard,5," Hmm, recently? Not much.",4,Big Bang Theory,25,4
16163,Sheldon,5," Is it because of the conflict that arises from your desperate need to pair-bond with a woman, and the apparent collective decision of all womankind to deny you that opportunity?",4,Big Bang Theory,178,30
16164,Leonard,5," Um, shut up.",4,Big Bang Theory,13,3
16165,Sheldon,5," You know, when my grandfather died, and Meemaw was alone, my mom arranged for her to visit a centre three times a week where she could socialize with other lonely people. It's very nice. They discuss current events, play bridge, get a hot meal.",4,Big Bang Theory,245,44
16166,Leonard,5, That sounds lovely.,4,Big Bang Theory,20,3
16167,Sheldon,5," It is if you like bridge. Do you like bridge, Leonard?",4,Big Bang Theory,55,11
16168,Leonard,5," Sheldon, I'm just not dating someone right now. I don't need to go to a senior centre.",4,Big Bang Theory,87,17
16169,Sheldon,5," Meemaw resisted at first, but now she loves it.",4,Big Bang Theory,48,9
16170,Leonard,5," Fine. If I don't meet someone soon, you can put me in a home.",4,Big Bang Theory,62,14
16171,Sheldon,5, It's not a home. It's a senior centre. We'd never put Meemaw in a home!,4,Big Bang Theory,72,15
16173,Leonard,5," Hey, guys.",4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
16174,Howard,5, Hey.,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
16175,Raj,5, Hey.,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
16176,Sheldon,5," All right, I'll bow to social pressure. Hey!",4,Big Bang Theory,45,8
16177,Howard,5," Excuse me. That's my girlfriend, Bernadette. I assigned her her own ringtone, Bernadette by The Four Tops. Hello, Bernadette.",4,Big Bang Theory,126,19
16178,Raj,5," When I call him, his phone plays Brown Eyed Girl. Which, now that I think about it, is not so good.",4,Big Bang Theory,100,21
16179,Leonard,5," You realize he's just rubbing our noses in the fact that he has a girlfriend, and we don't.",4,Big Bang Theory,92,18
16181,Leonard,5, You have a girlfriend? How could you have a girlfriend? You can't even speak to women.,4,Big Bang Theory,87,16
16182,Raj,5," Two words, deaf chick. It doesn't matter if I can't talk, because she can't hear me.",4,Big Bang Theory,85,16
16183,Leonard,5, What?,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
16184,Raj,5, That's what she said.,4,Big Bang Theory,22,4
16185,Leonard,5," Great. You have a girlfriend, Howard's got a girlfriend, Sheldon's got a girl",4,Big Bang Theory,78,13
16186,Sheldon,5," No, no, no, no!",4,Big Bang Theory,16,4
16187,Leonard,5, who's a friend.,4,Big Bang Theory,16,3
16188,Sheldon,5, Thank you.,4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
16189,Leonard,5," What about you, Stuart? You have a girlfriend yet?",4,Big Bang Theory,51,9
16191,Leonard,5," Oh. Well, good for you.",4,Big Bang Theory,24,5
16193,Leonard,5, Why don't you just break up with her?,4,Big Bang Theory,38,8
16195,Leonard,5, Why not?,4,Big Bang Theory,9,2
16197,Raj,5," Dude, why don't you just invoke your girlfriend pact with Wolowitz?",4,Big Bang Theory,68,11
16198,Leonard,5, Because I don't need his girlfriend to set me up with one of her girlfriends. I'm perfectly capable of finding a girl on my own.,4,Big Bang Theory,129,25
16199,Raj,5," Oh, Leonard, you remind me of the funny old story about a man who walks into a women's correctional institution with a stack of paperwork that will allow the female convicts to go free.",4,Big Bang Theory,186,34
16200,Leonard,5, You're saying I couldn't get laid in a women's prison with a handful of pardons.,4,Big Bang Theory,81,15
16201,Raj,5, Are you going to let me tell the story or not?,4,Big Bang Theory,47,11
16203,Sheldon,5, Leonard? Are you sleeping?,4,Big Bang Theory,27,4
16204,Leonard,5, No.,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
16205,Sheldon,5, Are you ill?,4,Big Bang Theory,13,3
16206,Leonard,5, No.,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
16207,Sheldon,5," Are you still depressed because you're alone, and no one loves you?",4,Big Bang Theory,68,12
16208,Leonard,5, I don't know. Maybe.,4,Big Bang Theory,21,4
16209,Sheldon,5, I want you to know that I'm genuinely concerned about your well-being.,4,Big Bang Theory,71,12
16210,Leonard,5, Thank you.,4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
16211,Sheldon,5, You're welcome. But it's still no reason to have your feet in my spot.,4,Big Bang Theory,71,14
16212,Amy,5, May I offer an observation?,4,Big Bang Theory,28,5
16213,Leonard,5, What the hell? How long has she been here?,4,Big Bang Theory,43,9
16214,Sheldon,5, Since we got home from the comic bookstore.,4,Big Bang Theory,44,8
16215,Leonard,5, That was two hours ago.,4,Big Bang Theory,24,5
16216,Sheldon,5," As per your suggestion, we're hanging out. Quite frankly, I don't see what all the hoopla's about. Go on, Amy.",4,Big Bang Theory,111,20
16217,Amy,5," From a neurobiological standpoint, Leonard, you may be alone because your psychological state is causing an actual pheromone-based stink of desperation.",4,Big Bang Theory,153,21
16218,Sheldon,5," Did you know that, Leonard?",4,Big Bang Theory,28,5
16219,Leonard,5, No.,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
16220,Sheldon,5, I did.,4,Big Bang Theory,7,2
16221,Amy,5, I understand that some people find mates in social gathering places such as bars or taverns. Have you tried a bar or tavern?,4,Big Bang Theory,125,23
16222,Leonard,5," No, I'm not gonna try to pick up a woman in a bar.",4,Big Bang Theory,51,13
16223,Sheldon,5," Wise decision. You see, Amy, success at a bar is based on classic male attributes such as height, strength, attractiveness, the ability to hold one's liquor and throw darts, separately or together. Leonard has none of these attributes, right, Leonard?",4,Big Bang Theory,252,40
16224,Leonard,5, Right.,4,Big Bang Theory,7,1
16225,Amy,5," That's not true of all bars. Juice bars, for example.",4,Big Bang Theory,54,10
16226,Sheldon,5," Oh! Good point, Amy. Yeah, building on your premise, Leonard could frequent sushi bars, salad bars, oyster bars, the Apple Genius Bar, what are you doing?",4,Big Bang Theory,155,26
16227,Leonard,5, Keep going. I'm listening.,4,Big Bang Theory,27,4
16228,Amy,5, That was rude.,4,Big Bang Theory,15,3
16229,Sheldon,5, He does it all the time. He's a cornucopia of social awkwardness.,4,Big Bang Theory,66,12
16230,Amy,5, Cornucopia. What a mellifluous word.,4,Big Bang Theory,37,5
16231,Sheldon,5, Let's make that our word of the day.,4,Big Bang Theory,37,8
16232,Amy,5, Agreed. And we'll use mellifluous tomorrow.,4,Big Bang Theory,44,6
16233,Sheldon,5," Well, I have to void my bladder. It was nice spending this time with you.",4,Big Bang Theory,74,15
16234,Amy,5, Wait. I have a request.,4,Big Bang Theory,24,5
16235,Sheldon,5, Yes?,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
16236,Amy,5, I'd like you to meet my mother.,4,Big Bang Theory,32,7
16237,Sheldon,5, I see. Can I get back to you on that?,4,Big Bang Theory,38,10
16238,Amy,5, Certainly. Good night.,4,Big Bang Theory,23,3
16239,Sheldon,5," Good night.  Leonard, Leonard, Leonard,",4,Big Bang Theory,40,5
16240,Leonard,5," Yeah, what?",4,Big Bang Theory,12,2
16241,Sheldon,5, Amy Farrah Fowler has asked me to meet her mother.,4,Big Bang Theory,51,10
16242,Leonard,5, Yeah. So?,4,Big Bang Theory,10,2
16243,Sheldon,5, What does that mean?,4,Big Bang Theory,21,4
16244,Leonard,5," Well, you know how you're always saying that Amy is a girl who's your friend, and not your girlfriend?",4,Big Bang Theory,103,19
16245,Sheldon,5, Uh-huh.,4,Big Bang Theory,8,1
16246,Leonard,5, You can't say that anymore.,4,Big Bang Theory,28,5
16247,Sheldon,5, Wait. What?,4,Big Bang Theory,12,2
16248,Leonard,5," Look, she obviously wants to take your relationship to the next level.",4,Big Bang Theory,71,12
16249,Sheldon,5, I don't want the next level. I like this level. Fix it for me!,4,Big Bang Theory,63,14
16250,Leonard,5," Me? Well, how am I supposed to fix it?",4,Big Bang Theory,39,9
16251,Sheldon,5," Simple! You want a girlfriend, Amy wants to be someone's girlfriend. Take her off my hands. I give you my blessing.",4,Big Bang Theory,116,21
16252,Leonard,5, That is insane.,4,Big Bang Theory,16,3
16253,Sheldon,5, You're right. It would never work. Amy finds you tedious.,4,Big Bang Theory,58,10
16254,Leonard,5," Okay, good luck.",4,Big Bang Theory,17,3
16255,Sheldon,5, Wait! What am I supposed to do?,4,Big Bang Theory,32,7
16256,Leonard,5," Well, have you considered telling her how you feel?",4,Big Bang Theory,52,9
16257,Sheldon,5," Leonard, I'm a physicist, not a hippie.",4,Big Bang Theory,40,7
16258,Leonard,5," All right, well, let me see if I can explain your situation using physics. What would you be if you were attached to another object by an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis?",4,Big Bang Theory,187,34
16259,Sheldon,5, Screwed.,4,Big Bang Theory,9,1
16260,Leonard,5, There you go.,4,Big Bang Theory,14,3
16261,Sheldon,5, Amy's right. He is tedious.,4,Big Bang Theory,28,5
16264,Howard,5, Why can't you get it?,4,Big Bang Theory,22,5
16266,Howard,5," Oh, hey. I hope you didn't hear that.",4,Big Bang Theory,38,8
16267,Leonard,5, The volcano thing? No.,4,Big Bang Theory,23,4
16268,Howard,5, What's with the T-shirt? You working at the Apple store now?,4,Big Bang Theory,61,11
16269,Leonard,5," No, it's just something I threw on.",4,Big Bang Theory,36,7
16270,Howard,5," I know all your shirts. That's not one of them. You were pretending to work at the Genius Bar to pick up women, weren't you?",4,Big Bang Theory,125,25
16271,Leonard,5," Yeah. Turns out, they guard the iPods, but they don't guard the shirts.",4,Big Bang Theory,72,13
16272,Howard,5," So, how'd it go?",4,Big Bang Theory,17,4
16273,Leonard,5," It was going well. I was showing this super hot girl how to boot up in Safe Mode. The manager got suspicious, and, well, long story short, they really do have a little jail in the mall.",4,Big Bang Theory,186,37
16274,Howard,5," Just FYI, don't try to go back with a fake moustache. I mean, they may not really be geniuses, but they see right through that.",4,Big Bang Theory,128,25
16275,Leonard,5," I want to invoke the girlfriend pact, Howard.",4,Big Bang Theory,46,8
16276,Howard,5, You that desperate?,4,Big Bang Theory,20,3
16277,Leonard,5," No, I just, I want what you have. You know, I want a woman in my life.",4,Big Bang Theory,71,17
16279,Leonard,5," To be clear, I meant like Bernadette, not your mother.",4,Big Bang Theory,55,10
16280,Howard,5," Yeah, I know what you mean.",4,Big Bang Theory,28,6
16282,Leonard,5," Well, I'm off to meet Bernadette's friend. How do I look?",4,Big Bang Theory,58,11
16283,Sheldon,5," As if one of the plants from Invasion of the Body Snatchers duplicated you in every way, only with an absurd amount of hair gel.",4,Big Bang Theory,129,25
16284,Leonard,5, What are you working on?,4,Big Bang Theory,25,5
16285,Sheldon,5, I'm removing my digital footprint from the Internet so Amy Farrah Fowler can't find me and compel me to meet her mother.,4,Big Bang Theory,121,22
16286,Leonard,5," Ah, you're going off the grid.",4,Big Bang Theory,31,6
16287,Sheldon,5, Exactly.,4,Big Bang Theory,9,1
16288,Leonard,5, The old Unabomber approach. Kudos.,4,Big Bang Theory,35,5
16289,Sheldon,5, Thank you. I've also sent Amy a relationship termination notice and changed my cell phone number and e-mail address.,4,Big Bang Theory,117,19
16290,Leonard,5, What if she just comes over?,4,Big Bang Theory,29,6
16291,Sheldon,5, She'll get lost. We no longer live at 2311 Los Robles. We now live at 311 Los Robles.,4,Big Bang Theory,86,18
16292,Leonard,5, You changed the address on the building? What about mail?,4,Big Bang Theory,58,10
16293,Sheldon,5," Oh, no worries, I explained my predicament to our letter carrier. He was sympathetic. His exact words were, Got your back, Jack. Bitches be crazy.",4,Big Bang Theory,147,25
16294,Leonard,5, Who is it?,4,Big Bang Theory,11,3
16295,Amy,5, Amy Farrah Fowler.,4,Big Bang Theory,19,3
16296,Sheldon,5, Darn! She found me!,4,Big Bang Theory,20,4
16297,Leonard,5, She's been here before.,4,Big Bang Theory,24,4
16298,Sheldon,5," The only flaw in an otherwise perfect plan. Now, get my back, Jack.",4,Big Bang Theory,68,13
16299,Leonard,5, What do you want to do?,4,Big Bang Theory,24,6
16300,Sheldon,5, Tell her I'm not here.,4,Big Bang Theory,23,5
16301,Leonard,5," Okay, where are you?",4,Big Bang Theory,21,4
16302,Sheldon,5," I don't know. You'll have to devise a scenario that plausibly explains my absence, keeping in mind that the key to a good lie lies in the details.",4,Big Bang Theory,147,28
16303,Leonard,5," Hi, Amy. Sheldon's not here.",4,Big Bang Theory,29,5
16304,Amy,5, All right. ,4,Big Bang Theory,12,2
16305,Sheldon,5, Way to go on the details.,4,Big Bang Theory,26,6
16307,Leonard,5," Thanks again for doing this, Bernadette.",4,Big Bang Theory,41,6
16309,Howard,5, Why the hell would you cross Ebola with the common cold?,4,Big Bang Theory,57,11
16313,Leonard,5, Hi.,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
16315,Leonard,5, Uh,4,Big Bang Theory,3,1
16317,Leonard,5," Yeah. So, Bernadette tells me she knows you from self-defence classes?",4,Big Bang Theory,71,11
16319,Leonard,5, Wow. Wouldn't think there'd be that many.,4,Big Bang Theory,42,7
16321,Leonard,5, Whoa!,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
16324,Sheldon,5," Proxima Centauri's the nearest star. The celestial bodies that follow are Alpha Centauri A, Toli, Barnard's Star, Wolf 359, Lalande 21185, Sirius A, Sirius B, BL-Ceti, UV-Ceti, Ross 154, Ross 248, Epsilon Eridani, Lac-9352, Ross 128, Procyon A, oh, darn, that's wrong!  EZ Aquarii A, EZ Aquarii B, EZ Aquarii C, Procyon A. Those are the stars that are nearest to me. Tra-la-la and fiddle-dee-dee.  Oh, dear. They really do be crazy.",4,Big Bang Theory,433,72
16327,Leonard,5," Should be, it's thirty dollars a pound.",4,Big Bang Theory,40,7
16329,Leonard,5," Yep, it is.",4,Big Bang Theory,12,3
16331,Leonard,5, Whoa!,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
16335,Howard,5, I think she likes you.,4,Big Bang Theory,23,5
16337,Sheldon,5," EZ Aquarii B, EZ Aquarii C, excuse me, madam.",4,Big Bang Theory,46,9
16338,Amy,5, Sheldon?,4,Big Bang Theory,9,1
16339,Sheldon,5, Rats!,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
16340,Amy,5, I believe a misunderstanding may have occurred when I asked you to meet my mother.,4,Big Bang Theory,83,15
16341,Sheldon,5," No misunderstanding. I've learned what that request actually means, and I don't want to be joined to another object by an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis.",4,Big Bang Theory,171,28
16342,Amy,5, In what way are you screwed? All I want to do is present you as my boyfriend to my mother so she'll be satisfied that I'm in a relationship.,4,Big Bang Theory,141,29
16343,Sheldon,5, So we'd be perpetrating a ruse?,4,Big Bang Theory,32,6
16344,Amy,5, Precisely.,4,Big Bang Theory,11,1
16345,Sheldon,5, And you haven't fallen hopelessly in love with me?,4,Big Bang Theory,51,9
16346,Amy,5, Don't be absurd. I find the notion of romantic love to be an unnecessary cultural construct that adds no value to human relationships.,4,Big Bang Theory,135,23
16347,Sheldon,5," Amy Farrah Fowler, that's the most pragmatic thing anyone has ever said to me.",4,Big Bang Theory,79,14
16348,Amy,5, I trust this clarification allows us to return to boy-slash-friend-slash-girl-slash-friend status.,4,Big Bang Theory,99,11
16349,Sheldon,5, Of course. Would you like to join me for Chinese food?,4,Big Bang Theory,55,11
16350,Amy,5," Sheldon, please, you're suffocating me.",4,Big Bang Theory,40,5
16351,Sheldon,5," My apologies. Good night, Amy.",4,Big Bang Theory,31,5
16352,Amy,5," Good night, Sheldon.",4,Big Bang Theory,21,3
16354,Howard,5," Come on, just give her a chance. Maybe she'll grow on you.",4,Big Bang Theory,59,12
16355,Leonard,5," Or maybe she'll finally succeed in ripping my nuts off. There are still 93 ways she hasn't tried yet. Look, Howard, I appreciate the effort, but this is, like, the worst date of my life.",4,Big Bang Theory,187,35
16356,Howard,5," Seriously? I was once robbed by a pre-op transsexual I met on J-Date, and that didn't even crack my top ten.",4,Big Bang Theory,109,21
16357,Leonard,5," I guess the difference is, I have some self-respect.",4,Big Bang Theory,53,9
16358,Howard,5, Not that I've ever seen.,4,Big Bang Theory,25,5
16359,Leonard,5, It's relatively new. I just know that I'm not gonna spend time with someone I don't like simply to have a girlfriend. I'm okay on my own.,4,Big Bang Theory,138,27
16361,Leonard,5," Look, uh, Joy, it was nice to meet you, but",4,Big Bang Theory,44,10
16363,Leonard,5, You're asking me out?,4,Big Bang Theory,22,4
16365,Leonard,5, I look forward to it.,4,Big Bang Theory,22,5
16368,Sheldon,5, I assure you I am quite real and I'm having regular intercourse with your daughter.,4,Big Bang Theory,84,15
16370,Sheldon,5," Oh, yes. We're like wild animals in heat. It's a wonder neither of us has been hurt.",4,Big Bang Theory,85,17
16372,Amy,5," You wanted me to have a boyfriend, Mother. Well, here he is. Have to sign off now. My hunger for Sheldon is stirring in my loins.",4,Big Bang Theory,130,26
16373,Sheldon,5," Oh, yes, it's time for me to make love to your daughter's vagina.",4,Big Bang Theory,66,13
16375,Amy,5," Thank you, Sheldon, that went very well.",4,Big Bang Theory,41,7
16376,Sheldon,5," Agreed. Amy, I find myself wondering if we should actually engage in coitus at least one time in our relationship. Bazinga. Bedtime. Please show yourself out.",4,Big Bang Theory,159,26
16378,Howard,6, Gagh!,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
16379,Leonard,6, Problem?,4,Big Bang Theory,9,1
16380,Howard,6, This is the worst cobbler I've ever eaten. I mean it tastes like it was made of actual ground-up shoemaker.,4,Big Bang Theory,108,20
16381,Sheldon,6, Amusing. A play on the two meanings of cobbler.,4,Big Bang Theory,48,9
16382,Raj,6," Hey guys, guess who I found at LAX. My baby sister Priya.",4,Big Bang Theory,58,12
16383,Sheldon,6," Excuse me. I object. You propose a guessing game, yet you don't give me enough time to guess. For the record, I was going to say your sister Priya.",4,Big Bang Theory,148,29
16385,Sheldon,6, Why would I change?,4,Big Bang Theory,20,4
16386,Leonard,6," The hope has been that you'd eventually bend to public opinion. So, Priya, what brings you back to LA?",4,Big Bang Theory,103,19
16388,Raj,6, Can you believe it? Little Priya's one of the lead attorneys for the biggest car company in India.,4,Big Bang Theory,99,18
16389,Sheldon,6," Given that when we met her she was finishing law school and planning an internship at a large Indian car company, it's actually extremely plausible.",4,Big Bang Theory,149,25
16390,Leonard,6, And your poll numbers just keep dropping.,4,Big Bang Theory,42,7
16392,Leonard,6," I'm going too, I'll show you where it is.",4,Big Bang Theory,42,9
16393,Raj,6," Alright, this goes without saying, but I'm just going to say it anyway. Hands off my sister.",4,Big Bang Theory,93,17
16394,Sheldon,6," Why would I touch her, she's covered with airplane germs.",4,Big Bang Theory,58,10
16395,Raj,6, I'm so not talking to you. I'm talking to him.,4,Big Bang Theory,47,10
16396,Howard,6," Hey, I've got a girlfriend now.",4,Big Bang Theory,32,6
16397,Raj,6, Oh please. My sister's much hotter than your girlfriend and you know it.,4,Big Bang Theory,73,13
16398,Howard,6, Let's just agree they're both hot.,4,Big Bang Theory,35,6
16399,Raj,6," Dude, that's my sister you're talking about.",4,Big Bang Theory,45,7
16400,Howard,6," Okay, forget who's hotter. The first time Priya came to LA, Leonard and I made a pact out of respect to our friendship, and to you, that neither of us would hit on her.",4,Big Bang Theory,169,34
16401,Raj,6, Did you pinky swear?,4,Big Bang Theory,21,4
16402,Howard,6, Yes.,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
16403,Raj,6, Okay then.,4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
16404,Sheldon,6, Cobbler. I'm still laughing.,4,Big Bang Theory,29,4
16407,Leonard,6, Yeah. It's good to see you too. Here you go.,4,Big Bang Theory,45,10
16409,Leonard,6, Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.  Okay.,4,Big Bang Theory,33,2
16411,Howard,6," So, you got any special plans with your sister?",4,Big Bang Theory,48,9
16412,Raj,6," Oh, not really, just hang out.",4,Big Bang Theory,31,6
16413,Sheldon,6," I always tell people, if you have only one day in Los Angeles, make it a train day.",4,Big Bang Theory,84,18
16414,Raj,6, Train day?,4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
16415,Sheldon,6," The fun starts with brunch at Carney's in Studio City, a hot dog stand in a converted railroad dining car. Next stop, Travel Town, an outdoor museum featuring 43 railroad engines, cars and other rolling stock from the 1880s to the 1930s. Finally, we're off to the glitz and glamour of Hollywood for dinner at, that's right, the Hollywood Carney's, a hot dog stand in a different converted railroad dining car.",4,Big Bang Theory,410,71
16416,Raj,6, I don't think we're going to do that.,4,Big Bang Theory,38,8
16417,Sheldon,6," Well then apparently, you hate fun.",4,Big Bang Theory,36,6
16418,Leonard,6," Hmm, Priya's not back yet? Well, I guess that's not unusual, women, men, the whole sitting, standing deal, so, what are we talking about?",4,Big Bang Theory,138,24
16419,Raj,6," Uh, my plans with Priya.",4,Big Bang Theory,25,5
16420,Sheldon,6, He rejected train day.,4,Big Bang Theory,23,4
16421,Leonard,6, Did you make it clear that it's two different train cars turned into hot dog stands?,4,Big Bang Theory,85,16
16422,Sheldon,6, Abundantly.,4,Big Bang Theory,12,1
16423,Leonard,6, I guess he just hates fun.,4,Big Bang Theory,27,6
16424,Sheldon,6, That's what I said.,4,Big Bang Theory,20,4
16426,Howard,6, I have a girlfriend now.,4,Big Bang Theory,25,5
16428,Howard,6," Yeah, I just wanna put it out there in case I inadvertently squirt any pheromones in your direction. Happy? . ",4,Big Bang Theory,111,20
16429,Leonard,6," So, uh, Priya, what are your plans while you're here.",4,Big Bang Theory,54,10
16431,Sheldon,6, Do you like trains?,4,Big Bang Theory,20,4
16433,Sheldon,6, You might as well just wait at the airport for your flight.,4,Big Bang Theory,60,12
16435,Sheldon,6," You are in a forest. There is quicksand to the west, a path leads to the east. Go east. An iron gate blocks your way. Open gate. It's locked. Hmm, well, so much for that.",4,Big Bang Theory,171,35
16436,Leonard,6," It's getting pretty late, how come you're still up?",4,Big Bang Theory,52,9
16437,Sheldon,6, I've found an emulator online that lets you play classic text based computer games from the 1980s.,4,Big Bang Theory,99,17
16438,Leonard,6, That's pretty cool.,4,Big Bang Theory,20,3
16439,Sheldon,6," Oh yes. It runs on the world's most powerful graphics chip, imagination.",4,Big Bang Theory,73,12
16440,Leonard,6, You've really got to get out more.,4,Big Bang Theory,35,7
16441,Sheldon,6," Go north. You can't go that way. Go west. A troll blocks your passage. Okay, fasten your seatbelts, kill troll. With what? With sword.  You don't have the sword. Good golly, it's as if it's actually happening to me.",4,Big Bang Theory,216,39
16443,Leonard,6," Yeah, well,  Sheldon's still up.",4,Big Bang Theory,33,5
16445,Leonard,6," Yeah, he does but he got caught up in a computer game and",4,Big Bang Theory,58,13
16446,Sheldon,6," Hit troll with axe. Hit troll with axe. Hit troll with axe. Oh my, this is one tough troll.",4,Big Bang Theory,92,19
16448,Leonard,6," If the past is any indication, no.",4,Big Bang Theory,35,7
16449,Sheldon,6," Leonard, I'm trapped in quicksand, the axe is dragging me down.",4,Big Bang Theory,64,11
16450,Leonard,6, Drop axe.,4,Big Bang Theory,10,2
16451,Sheldon,6, Drop axe. Brilliant.,4,Big Bang Theory,21,3
16452,Leonard,6," Give me a minute. Sheldon,",4,Big Bang Theory,27,5
16453,Sheldon,6," Hold on. I have to figure out how to get the bucket, so I can carry the mud past the dragon.",4,Big Bang Theory,93,21
16454,Leonard,6," Sheldon, you need to work in the morning.",4,Big Bang Theory,42,8
16455,Sheldon,6, I know.,4,Big Bang Theory,8,2
16456,Leonard,6," Well then, bed mister.",4,Big Bang Theory,23,4
16457,Sheldon,6, Five more minutes.,4,Big Bang Theory,19,3
16458,Leonard,6, Really? You're going to risk getting sleepy in the middle of your thermodynamic fluctuations seminar? You know what happens when you yawn in public.,4,Big Bang Theory,149,24
16459,Sheldon,6, Everyone will see my oddly shaped uvula.,4,Big Bang Theory,41,7
16460,Leonard,6," You don't want that, do you?",4,Big Bang Theory,29,6
16461,Sheldon,6, No. But it's a shame our society mocks the differently uvulated. Who was at the door?,4,Big Bang Theory,86,16
16462,Leonard,6," Oh, uh, building manager. They have to fix a pipe so the water will be off tomorrow from noon to two.",4,Big Bang Theory,102,21
16463,Sheldon,6, That's unacceptable. We're supposed to be given written notice.,4,Big Bang Theory,64,9
16464,Leonard,6," No, no, it doesn't matter, we'll be at work.",4,Big Bang Theory,45,9
16465,Sheldon,6," Well, what if I spill tomato soup on my shirt and have to come home to change, only to find there's no water for an enzyme soak.",4,Big Bang Theory,129,27
16466,Leonard,6," Bifurcated uvula, Sheldon!",4,Big Bang Theory,27,3
16467,Sheldon,6, I'll have the chicken noodle. Goodnight.,4,Big Bang Theory,41,6
16468,Leonard,6, We're going to have to be very quiet.,4,Big Bang Theory,38,8
16469,Sheldon,6," I know how to get the bucket! I can turn the axe around and use the handle to reach it. Let's see. Go north. You are in a forest. Go north. You are in a forest. Go north. You are in a forest. Oh dear, I believe I'm lost. Well, I'll just have to get a fresh start tomorrow.",4,Big Bang Theory,273,59
16470,Leonard,6," No, no, no, no, no. You just need, you just need, you just need to map it out. Come on, I'll help you. So, uh, you stopped at the stream and you turned north three times?",4,Big Bang Theory,171,36
16471,Sheldon,6, Yes.,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
16472,Leonard,6," You're right, you're lost, good luck.",4,Big Bang Theory,38,6
16475,Leonard,6, Huh! Sorry!,4,Big Bang Theory,12,2
16477,Leonard,6," I don't know. When I'm in bed with a girl, it's just, it's my go to response.",4,Big Bang Theory,78,17
16479,Leonard,6," Oh, right, sure. I wish you could stay in LA a while longer.",4,Big Bang Theory,61,13
16481,Leonard,6," You know, I was thinking, there are some great research facilities in India.",4,Big Bang Theory,77,13
16483,Leonard,6," Well, I'm just saying, I don't have any real ties here, so if I were to move to New Delhi we could, you know, go out.",4,Big Bang Theory,118,26
16485,Leonard,6," Well, yes, but, things have changed, you know, you're older, I'm older. Look, no more superhero bedsheets.",4,Big Bang Theory,107,17
16487,Leonard,6, It doesn't?,4,Big Bang Theory,12,2
16489,Leonard,6, I'm not that white. My great-great grandmother was half Cherokee. I know that's not the right kind of Indian but it is something.,4,Big Bang Theory,130,23
16491,Sheldon,6,  Leonard.  Leonard.  Leonard.,4,Big Bang Theory,30,3
16492,Leonard,6, What?,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
16493,Sheldon,6, I heard a woman laughing.,4,Big Bang Theory,26,5
16494,Leonard,6," Oh, uh, yeah, I was trying to see if I could laugh as a woman.",4,Big Bang Theory,63,15
16495,Sheldon,6," Oh. Well, good job, quite convincing. I smell perfume.",4,Big Bang Theory,55,9
16496,Leonard,6, Air freshener.,4,Big Bang Theory,15,2
16497,Sheldon,6, And is that lipstick on your cheek and neck.,4,Big Bang Theory,45,9
16498,Leonard,6," Uh, rash, that's a bad rash.",4,Big Bang Theory,29,6
16499,Sheldon,6, My sympathies. I am no stranger to the crimson scourge that is dermatitis. Can I interest you in a topical steroid from my lotion and unguent collection?,4,Big Bang Theory,154,27
16500,Leonard,6," Uh, yeah, yeah, that sounds great.",4,Big Bang Theory,35,6
16501,Sheldon,6," Very well, I'm sure I can find something that will help you ditch that itch.",4,Big Bang Theory,77,15
16502,Leonard,6," Okay, he's in the bathroom, let's go.",4,Big Bang Theory,38,7
16503,Sheldon,6, Do you prefer ointment or cream?,4,Big Bang Theory,33,6
16504,Leonard,6," Uh, cream.",4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
16505,Sheldon,6, With or without a numbing agent?,4,Big Bang Theory,33,6
16506,Leonard,6, Without.,4,Big Bang Theory,9,1
16507,Sheldon,6," Really? Leonard, there are no heroes when it comes to dermatitis.",4,Big Bang Theory,66,11
16508,Leonard,6, Fine. With.,4,Big Bang Theory,12,2
16509,Sheldon,6, Prescription or non-prescription strength.,4,Big Bang Theory,43,4
16510,Leonard,6, Use your best judgement.,4,Big Bang Theory,25,4
16511,Sheldon,6," Well, I think I have a nice 2009 AnaMantle HC. It's usually indicated for acutely inflamed haemorrhoids, but it also goes nicely with non mucosal body parts.",4,Big Bang Theory,158,27
16512,Leonard,6, Sounds great.,4,Big Bang Theory,14,2
16513,Sheldon,6, Excellent choice.,4,Big Bang Theory,18,2
16514,Leonard,6," Right, right, alright. ",4,Big Bang Theory,24,3
16515,Sheldon,6, Priya?,4,Big Bang Theory,7,1
16517,Sheldon,6," For shame, Leonard. For shame. And to think I was ready to waste the last of my good haemorrhoid cream on you.",4,Big Bang Theory,111,22
16519,Leonard,6," Making pretty good time, huh?",4,Big Bang Theory,30,5
16520,Sheldon,6," Is that really what you want to talk about, Leonard?",4,Big Bang Theory,53,10
16521,Leonard,6, No.,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
16522,Sheldon,6, What do you want to talk about?,4,Big Bang Theory,32,7
16523,Leonard,6, Please don't tell anyone I spent the night with Raj's sister.,4,Big Bang Theory,62,11
16524,Sheldon,6, There it is. What if someone asks?,4,Big Bang Theory,35,7
16525,Leonard,6, No-one's going to ask if I spent the night with Raj's sister.,4,Big Bang Theory,62,12
16526,Sheldon,6, Perhaps. But they might ask me something else.,4,Big Bang Theory,47,8
16527,Leonard,6, Like what?,4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
16528,Sheldon,6," Like, has Leonard betrayed any of his friends recently?",4,Big Bang Theory,56,9
16529,Leonard,6, Priya and I are both adults. We didn't betray Raj.,4,Big Bang Theory,51,10
16530,Sheldon,6," In fact, you did, but I was referring to Howard.",4,Big Bang Theory,49,10
16531,Leonard,6, What are you talking about?,4,Big Bang Theory,28,5
16532,Sheldon,6," April 12th, 2005, Bob's Big Boy, Toluca Lake. Raj had just introduced us to Priya for the first time, and she was enjoying the sweet taste of Hindu rebellion in the form of a Bob's Super Big Boy hamburger. In order to preserve your friendship, you and Howard made a pinky swear that neither of you would attempt to woo her. I had a patty melt.",4,Big Bang Theory,344,66
16533,Leonard,6," Okay, fine, I betrayed Howard.",4,Big Bang Theory,31,5
16534,Sheldon,6, And Raj.,4,Big Bang Theory,9,2
16535,Leonard,6," Alright, and Raj.",4,Big Bang Theory,18,3
16536,Sheldon,6, And me.,4,Big Bang Theory,8,2
16537,Leonard,6, You?,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
16538,Sheldon,6," Violation of the roommate agreement, overnight guest notification clause.",4,Big Bang Theory,74,9
16539,Leonard,6," Okay fine, I'm, I'm a horrible human being, I'm the Darth Vader of Pasadena.",4,Big Bang Theory,77,14
16540,Sheldon,6, You're far too short to be Darth Vader. At best you might be a turncoat Ewok.,4,Big Bang Theory,78,16
16541,Leonard,6," My point is, Priya's gone. And it would be much better if no-one else found out about this.",4,Big Bang Theory,92,18
16542,Sheldon,6," You mean, you want me to keep a secret.",4,Big Bang Theory,40,9
16543,Leonard,6, Yes.,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
16544,Sheldon,6, You know I can't keep a secret.,4,Big Bang Theory,32,7
16545,Leonard,6," You can if you try. Think about it this way, if I were Batman and you were Alfred, you'd keep that secret. Right?",4,Big Bang Theory,114,23
16546,Sheldon,6, Why do you get to be Batman?,4,Big Bang Theory,29,7
16547,Leonard,6," Because, well, Batman has the secret.",4,Big Bang Theory,38,6
16548,Sheldon,6, Well Alfred has secrets too.,4,Big Bang Theory,29,5
16549,Leonard,6, Like what?,4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
16550,Sheldon,6," Alfred knows that Barbara Gordon is Batgirl. Which I've now just told to Batman. See, I can't keep a secret.",4,Big Bang Theory,109,20
16552,Sheldon,6, Ta-da!,4,Big Bang Theory,7,1
16553,Leonard,6, What.,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
16554,Sheldon,6, Ta-da. It's short for da-da-da-da!,4,Big Bang Theory,35,5
16555,Leonard,6," Kind of busy here, Sheldon.",4,Big Bang Theory,28,5
16556,Sheldon,6," I know, that's why I shortened it.",4,Big Bang Theory,35,7
16557,Leonard,6, What do you want.,4,Big Bang Theory,18,4
16558,Sheldon,6, I came to go over your alibi for last night.,4,Big Bang Theory,45,10
16559,Leonard,6, What alibi?,4,Big Bang Theory,12,2
16560,Sheldon,6," You've asked me to lie on your behalf, and as you know, I am deeply uncomfortable with impromptu dishonest, so I've provided you with an iron clad alibi. You couldn't have spent last night with Priya, because you were with another woman.",4,Big Bang Theory,238,42
16561,Leonard,6," Oh, I'm so sure I'm going to regret this, but, who was I with?",4,Big Bang Theory,63,14
16562,Sheldon,6," The fun loving, and morally loose, Miss Maggie McGeary.",4,Big Bang Theory,56,9
16563,Leonard,6," Oh, God.",4,Big Bang Theory,9,2
16564,Sheldon,6," You met her at Pasadena's most popular Irish watering hole, Lucky Baldwin's, where Maggie spends her nights tending bar, with a head full of curls and a heart full of dreams.",4,Big Bang Theory,175,31
16565,Leonard,6," Leonard, call me if you're interested in coitus. Sincerely, Maggie McGeary.",4,Big Bang Theory,76,11
16566,Sheldon,6, And if anyone were to actually call that number they will hear this.,4,Big Bang Theory,69,13
16568,Sheldon,6," It's pretty convincing, huh? And it wasn't even a real person. And here is the clincher. A lock of Maggie's flaming auburn hair.",4,Big Bang Theory,129,23
16569,Leonard,6, Where did you get that?,4,Big Bang Theory,24,5
16570,Sheldon,6, From an orang-u-tan in the primate lab.,4,Big Bang Theory,40,7
16571,Leonard,6, An orang-u-tan?,4,Big Bang Theory,16,2
16572,Sheldon,6," Well, no-one's going to run a DNA test on it, Leonard, honestly you over-think everything.",4,Big Bang Theory,91,15
16573,Leonard,6," Sheldon, I don't need an alibi. Nobody's going to ask about last night as long as you just zip your lip.  Thankyou. Now don't worry, everything is going to be fine. (Sheldon writes â€œI doubt itâ€ù on Leonard's whiteboard.",4,Big Bang Theory,223,39
16575,Leonard,6, Hey.,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
16576,Raj,6," Hey, Leonard, will you please tell Howard my sister's never been attracted to him.",4,Big Bang Theory,83,14
16577,Leonard,6," C'mon Raj, how am I supposed to know who she's attracted to. Or was attracted to. Or who she might be attracted to. In the future.",4,Big Bang Theory,131,26
16578,Sheldon,6," And I have nothing to contribute to this conversation. Because I too know absolutely nothing about Priya's preferences in male companionship. And with that, I will re-zip my lip.",4,Big Bang Theory,179,29
16579,Raj,6," Hey, so what did you guys think of the new episode of Caprica last night?",4,Big Bang Theory,74,15
16580,Leonard,6, I didn't see it.,4,Big Bang Theory,17,4
16581,Howard,6, Didn't see it? What were you doing?,4,Big Bang Theory,36,7
16582,Leonard,6," Uh, I was out.",4,Big Bang Theory,15,4
16583,Raj,6, On Caprica night?,4,Big Bang Theory,18,3
16584,Leonard,6," Yeah, I, uh, went for a drink.",4,Big Bang Theory,31,7
16585,Howard,6," Really, you, and where, where did you go?",4,Big Bang Theory,42,8
16586,Leonard,6," To, uh, Lucky Baldwin's.",4,Big Bang Theory,25,4
16587,Sheldon,6," Oh, I've heard of that place, isn't that Pasadena's favourite Irish watering hole.",4,Big Bang Theory,83,13
16588,Leonard,6, Yes.,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
16589,Sheldon,6," Did you meet anyone interesting there, perhaps a promiscuous redheaded barmaid?",4,Big Bang Theory,80,11
16590,Leonard,6, As a matter of fact I.. I I can't I can't I can't do it.,4,Big Bang Theory,57,15
16591,Sheldon,6," Sure you can, you're doing fine, it's very believable.",4,Big Bang Theory,55,9
16592,Leonard,6," Look, I'm sorry Raj, but the truth is I was with Priya last night.",4,Big Bang Theory,67,14
16593,Sheldon,6," Don't listen to him, he's still light headed from all the Irish whiskey and pickled eggs in his system.",4,Big Bang Theory,104,19
16594,Raj,6, What were you doing with Priya?,4,Big Bang Theory,32,6
16595,Sheldon,6," I believe they engaged in coitus but, more importantly, if Leonard had not abandoned his story, would you have found it plausible?",4,Big Bang Theory,131,22
16596,Raj,6, What? You slept with my sister?,4,Big Bang Theory,32,6
16597,Leonard,6, Yeah.,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
16598,Howard,6, How could you? We had a pact!,4,Big Bang Theory,30,7
16599,Raj,6," Excuse me, I think how could you she's my sister takes precedence over a five year old pinky swear!",4,Big Bang Theory,100,19
16600,Sheldon,6," May I point out, in a parallel universe, your friends are saying Maggie McGeary, she sounds lovely.",4,Big Bang Theory,100,17
16601,Leonard,6," Look, I admit it, I may have crossed a line here, but come on, Raj, your sister is a grown woman. To her, I'm a forbidden piece of white chocolate.",4,Big Bang Theory,148,30
16602,Raj,6," I I don't believe it, this is a terrible betrayal of my trust.",4,Big Bang Theory,63,13
16603,Leonard,6," No, no, no, would it help if I told you that I offered her my heart and she kind of stomped on it.",4,Big Bang Theory,99,23
16604,Raj,6, How hard did she stomp?,4,Big Bang Theory,24,5
16605,Leonard,6, Very hard.,4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
16606,Raj,6," Okay, I'm good.",4,Big Bang Theory,16,3
16607,Howard,6," Yeah, well, Raj, I just want to say that I'd never betray your trust. Unlike Leonard, I respect you.",4,Big Bang Theory,101,19
16608,Leonard,6, Really?,4,Big Bang Theory,8,1
16609,Howard,6, Mmm.,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
16610,Leonard,6, Was it out of respect that you didn't tell Raj about the time you dropped his iPhone in a urinal?,4,Big Bang Theory,98,20
16611,Raj,6, Dude! I put that thing on my face!,4,Big Bang Theory,35,8
16612,Sheldon,6, I think a more amusing violation of Raj's trust is when Howard convinced him that foreigners give presents to Americans on Thanksgiving.,4,Big Bang Theory,137,22
16613,Howard,6," Hey, I didn't see you giving back your Snoopy snowcone maker.",4,Big Bang Theory,62,11
16614,Raj,6, That was all a lie? This year's gifts are already wrapped!,4,Big Bang Theory,59,11
16615,Howard,6," And as long as we're talking about betraying our friends, how about the month Sheldon spent grinding up insects and mixing them into Leonard's food.",4,Big Bang Theory,149,25
16616,Sheldon,6," Well, excuse me. That was not a betrayal, that was an experiment to determine at what concentration food starts tasting mothy.",4,Big Bang Theory,127,21
16617,Leonard,6, You put moths in my food?,4,Big Bang Theory,26,6
16618,Sheldon,6, For science.,4,Big Bang Theory,13,2
16619,Raj,6, I can't believe you kissed my sister with moth mouth.,4,Big Bang Theory,54,10
16620,Leonard,6," Well, uh, I can't believe you used Sheldon's toothbrush.",4,Big Bang Theory,57,9
16621,Sheldon,6, You used my toothbrush?,4,Big Bang Theory,24,4
16622,Raj,6," Not the brush part, just the little rubber thing to pick food from my teeth and massage my gums.",4,Big Bang Theory,97,19
16623,Leonard,6," Okay, I, I, I think it's safe to say that we've all done some things we're not particularly proud of. But come on, we're friends. Friends overlook each other's minor lapses. For the record, Howard, I'm sorry that I broke our pact.",4,Big Bang Theory,231,42
16624,Howard,6," Thankyou, and I'm sorry about your phone. And Thanksgiving. And while we're at it, you don't have to wash our clothes on the fourth of July.",4,Big Bang Theory,141,26
16625,Raj,6," As long as we're apologising, Sheldon, I, I'm sorry I used your toothbrush.",4,Big Bang Theory,76,13
16626,Sheldon,6, And I'm sorry. But that behaviour is beyond the pale and cannot be tolerated. We are no longer friends.,4,Big Bang Theory,104,19
16627,Raj,6, I got you a talking Thomas the Tank Engine for Thanksgiving.,4,Big Bang Theory,61,11
16628,Sheldon,6, With real puffing smoke?,4,Big Bang Theory,25,4
16629,Raj,6, Yes.,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
16630,Sheldon,6, Alright. But I'm watching you.,4,Big Bang Theory,31,5
16632,Leonard,6," Hey, you got Snoopy out. Can I have a snowcone?",4,Big Bang Theory,48,10
16633,Sheldon,6," Well, sure.",4,Big Bang Theory,12,2
16634,Leonard,6," These are pretty god, what flavour is this?",4,Big Bang Theory,44,8
16635,Sheldon,6, Guess.,4,Big Bang Theory,7,1
16636,Leonard,6, Papaya?,4,Big Bang Theory,8,1
16637,Sheldon,6, No.,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
16638,Leonard,6, Guava?,4,Big Bang Theory,7,1
16639,Sheldon,6, You're so close.,4,Big Bang Theory,17,3
16640,Leonard,6, I give up.,4,Big Bang Theory,11,3
16641,Sheldon,6," Mango, caterpillar. What are you doing? You said you liked it!",4,Big Bang Theory,63,11
16643,Leonard,7," No, seriously, I think I've finally figured out my problem with women.",4,Big Bang Theory,71,12
16644,Sheldon,7, The capybara is the largest member of the rodent family.,4,Big Bang Theory,57,10
16645,Leonard,7, What does that have to do with me and women?,4,Big Bang Theory,45,10
16646,Sheldon,7, Nothing. It was a desperate attempt to introduce an alternate topic of conversation.,4,Big Bang Theory,85,13
16647,Leonard,7," My problem is, I don't project confidence. So I decided that the next time I meet a woman I think is attractive, rather than holding back and being cautious, I'm going to assume the mantle of self-assurance.",4,Big Bang Theory,208,37
16648,Raj,7," Oh, yeah? What's that look like?",4,Big Bang Theory,33,6
16649,Leonard,7," Hi. I'm Leonard. And you are beautiful. You pop, sparkle and buzz electric. I'm going to pick you up at eight, show you a night you will never forget.",4,Big Bang Theory,151,29
16650,Raj,7, Where are we going?,4,Big Bang Theory,20,4
16651,Howard,7, Good news. I made it onto the team for the new Defence Department laser-equipped surveillance satellite.,4,Big Bang Theory,105,16
16652,Sheldon,7," Excuse me. If we're changing topics, I believe I have first dibs with capybara, a rodent the size of a baby hippo.",4,Big Bang Theory,115,22
16653,Leonard,7, Congratulations Howard.,4,Big Bang Theory,24,2
16654,Howard,7," Thanks. Listen, I have to get a security clearance, so you guys might be hearing from the FBI.",4,Big Bang Theory,95,18
16655,Raj,7," Whoa, whoa, whoa! I don't want to speak to the FBI.",4,Big Bang Theory,52,11
16656,Leonard,7, Why not?,4,Big Bang Theory,9,2
16657,Raj,7, I'm brown and I talk funny.,4,Big Bang Theory,28,6
16658,Howard,7, They're just doing a background check on me.,4,Big Bang Theory,45,8
16659,Raj,7," It doesn't matter. They'll find a reason to give me a one-way ticket back to Gandhi-ville. By the way, when I say that, it's not offensive.",4,Big Bang Theory,140,26
16660,Leonard,7," Don't be ridiculous, Raj. You're here legally.",4,Big Bang Theory,47,7
16661,Raj,7, Nobody cares. Do you know how long it's been since I got through airport security without being given a colonoscopy?,4,Big Bang Theory,117,20
16662,Sheldon,7," You know, I try very hard to make our lunch hours educational and informative, but your insistence on talking about your own lives stymies me at every turn.",4,Big Bang Theory,157,28
16663,Leonard,7," Fine, Sheldon, tell us about your giant rodents.",4,Big Bang Theory,49,8
16664,Sheldon,7," No, you squandered your time with me, and the moment has now passed. Feast on your disappointment, much as the capybara feasts on its own waste.",4,Big Bang Theory,145,26
16666,Raj,7," Oh, Bella, don't you see? Edward's only pushing you away because he loves you.  Coming.",4,Big Bang Theory,88,15
16668,Raj,7, Rum cake?,4,Big Bang Theory,10,2
16670,Raj,7, Seven years.,4,Big Bang Theory,13,2
16672,Raj,7," I'm in this country legally, you know.",4,Big Bang Theory,39,7
16674,Raj,7," Of course not. I'm here on an H-1B visa, which means I can't be associated in any way with crime or criminal activity. And I'm not.",4,Big Bang Theory,132,26
16676,Raj,7," No, just me. Oh, there it is. Here comes a cavity search.",4,Big Bang Theory,58,12
16678,Raj,7," Please don't send me back to India, it's so crowded. It's like the whole country is one endless Comic-Con, except everybody's wearing the same costume, Indian Guy.",4,Big Bang Theory,164,27
16680,Raj,7," I love this country! The-the baseball, the freedom, the rampant morbid obesity! From California to the New York Island, I'm a real Yankee Doodle boy!",4,Big Bang Theory,150,25
16682,Raj,7," My country 'tis of thee, duh duh duh liberty, It's really great.",4,Big Bang Theory,65,12
16684,Leonard,7," So, when Howard said the FBI would be contacting me, I was expecting Mulder. Glad to see I got Scully.",4,Big Bang Theory,103,20
16686,Leonard,7," Mulder and Scully. X-Files. The truth is out there. Never mind. Uh, so, what would you like to know?",4,Big Bang Theory,101,19
16688,Leonard,7," Yes. Of course, we're in different departments. He's an engineer and I'm an experimental physicist. You know, one of those guys who examines the building blocks of creation and says, Hello, maker of the universe, I see what you did there. Good one.",4,Big Bang Theory,249,43
16690,Leonard,7," Good. It's a good relationship. Of course, most of my relationships are good. Probably because I exude confidence. People are drawn to that, you know? Confidence, not exuding.",4,Big Bang Theory,176,28
16692,Leonard,7," You are beautiful, you know that? You pop, sparkle and buzz electric. I'm going to pick you up at eight, show you a night you will never forget.",4,Big Bang Theory,145,28
16694,Leonard,7, Really?,4,Big Bang Theory,8,1
16696,Leonard,7," Is that, oh, my, I didn't see the ring with my glasses off, so, look at that, I'm starting to exude.",4,Big Bang Theory,101,21
16698,Leonard,7, Want to get that?,4,Big Bang Theory,18,4
16699,Sheldon,7, Not particularly.,4,Big Bang Theory,18,2
16700,Leonard,7, Could you get that?,4,Big Bang Theory,20,4
16701,Sheldon,7, I suppose I could if I were asked.,4,Big Bang Theory,35,8
16702,Leonard,7, Would you please get that?,4,Big Bang Theory,27,5
16703,Sheldon,7, Of course. Why do you have to make things so complicated?,4,Big Bang Theory,58,11
16705,Sheldon,7, Yes.,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
16707,Sheldon,7," You say you're Special Agent Page, FBI.",4,Big Bang Theory,40,7
16709,Sheldon,7, And here is my Justice League membership card. But that doesn't prove I know Batman.,4,Big Bang Theory,85,15
16711,Sheldon,7, Oh. All right. I doubt anyone would risk the stiff penalties for impersonating a federal officer just to ask questions about a minor league engineer with an unresolved Oedipal complex.,4,Big Bang Theory,185,30
16713,Sheldon,7," For the record, I truly support the FBI in the mission which is expressed through their motto?",4,Big Bang Theory,95,17
16715,Sheldon,7," Correct. Now to business. 18 years ago, I sent the FBI Crime Lab samples from a bag of excrement that had been lit on fire on my front porch for fingerprinting and DNA analysis. Why haven't I heard back yet?",4,Big Bang Theory,208,40
16717,Sheldon,7, That's of little comfort to a nation attempting to scrape burning feces off its shoes.,4,Big Bang Theory,87,15
16719,Sheldon,7," A little, but go on.",4,Big Bang Theory,21,5
16721,Sheldon,7," I'm going to answer that with a visual aid. This is my nine-disc complete Lord of the Rings trilogy blu-ray set. Mr. Wolowitz borrowed it, damaged plastic retention hub number three, and then returned it to me, hoping I wouldn't notice. Would you characterize that as responsible?",4,Big Bang Theory,281,47
16723,Sheldon,7," You heard me say blu-ray, right?",4,Big Bang Theory,33,6
16725,Sheldon,7, Very well. Would you be interested in knowing that Mr. Wolowitz once snuck onto my World of Warcraft account and changed the name of a certain level-80 warlock from Sheldor to Smeldor?,4,Big Bang Theory,185,32
16727,Sheldon,7," Is there anything else? Where would you like to start? He refuses to pay fines when he's overdue with books I lend him. He crashed the Mars Rover while attempting to impress a woman. He recommended that I go see the third Matrix movie because it was, and I quote, just as good as the first one. If that's not irresponsible, I don't know what is.",4,Big Bang Theory,346,66
16729,Sheldon,7, Did I say Mars Rover?,4,Big Bang Theory,22,5
16731,Sheldon,7," That was actually a poorly chosen example, as it had nothing to do with me.",4,Big Bang Theory,76,15
16733,Sheldon,7, I don't want to. Not that my disinclination to discuss the topic should be interpreted as evidence of Howard Wolowitz's culpability in the destruction of government property worth millions of dollars.,4,Big Bang Theory,201,31
16735,Sheldon,7," Oh, good. I was afraid you were going to fixate on that Mars Rover incident.",4,Big Bang Theory,77,15
16737,Howard,7," Hey, buddies. Guess who didn't get security clearance to work on the giant space laser?",4,Big Bang Theory,88,15
16738,Leonard,7, What happened?,4,Big Bang Theory,15,2
16739,Howard,7," Apparently, the background interviews didn't go well. You guys wouldn't know anything about that, would you?",4,Big Bang Theory,109,16
16740,Raj,7," Well, actually, I may have gotten a little tipsy when I talked to her.",4,Big Bang Theory,71,14
16741,Leonard,7, And I may have hit on her a little bit.,4,Big Bang Theory,40,10
16742,Raj,7, I may have thrown up rum cake on her shoes.,4,Big Bang Theory,44,10
16743,Howard,7," I see. Well, it's good to know, when I need you guys, I can always count on you to step up and ruin everything.",4,Big Bang Theory,112,24
16744,Leonard,7, I feel awful.,4,Big Bang Theory,14,3
16745,Raj,7," Ah, me, too.",4,Big Bang Theory,13,3
16746,Leonard,7," To tell you the truth, I thought if anyone was going to screw things up for Howard, it'd be Sheldon.",4,Big Bang Theory,101,20
16747,Sheldon,7," Well, your expectations have been subverted. Aha.",4,Big Bang Theory,50,7
16749,Leonard,7, What are you doing up?,4,Big Bang Theory,23,5
16750,Sheldon,7," Sleep eludes me, Leonard.",4,Big Bang Theory,26,4
16751,Leonard,7, Really? Maybe sleep has met you before.,4,Big Bang Theory,40,7
16752,Sheldon,7, Mockery? That's all you have to offer?,4,Big Bang Theory,39,7
16753,Leonard,7, I'm sorry. Why can't you sleep?,4,Big Bang Theory,32,6
16754,Sheldon,7, Who knows? I haven't watched any scary movies recently. I'm no longer obsessing over why the predicted mass of the quantum vacuum has little effect on the expansion of the universe. And it's been weeks since I took that accidental sip of Red Bull.,4,Big Bang Theory,248,44
16755,Leonard,7, Did something happen today that's bothering you?,4,Big Bang Theory,49,7
16756,Sheldon,7," Well, I did mention the Mars Rover incident to that FBI agent and probably cost Howard his security clearance.",4,Big Bang Theory,111,19
16757,Leonard,7, What?,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
16758,Sheldon,7, But why should that keep me up?,4,Big Bang Theory,32,7
16759,Leonard,7, Because you feel guilty?,4,Big Bang Theory,25,4
16760,Sheldon,7, Interesting. So you're saying my insomnia is caused by a guilty conscience.,4,Big Bang Theory,76,12
16761,Leonard,7," Actually, you don't have insomnia. You're sleeping now.",4,Big Bang Theory,56,8
16762,Sheldon,7, Excuse me?,4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
16763,Leonard,7, You're having a guilt-ridden dream.,4,Big Bang Theory,36,5
16764,Sheldon,7, Do you have any evidence to support that hypothesis?,4,Big Bang Theory,53,9
16765,Leonard,7, How about that Gorn sitting on the couch?,4,Big Bang Theory,42,8
16766,Sheldon,7," That seems fairly conclusive.  No, Gorn, no. That's where I sit.",4,Big Bang Theory,65,11
16768,Sheldon,7," Thank you for agreeing to see me, Agent Page.",4,Big Bang Theory,46,9
16770,Sheldon,7, Yes.,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
16772,Sheldon,7, No.,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
16774,Sheldon,7, I'm sorry. I don't recall you saying no backsies.,4,Big Bang Theory,50,9
16776,Sheldon,7," Yes. I'd like to offer a laudatory statement about Howard's many excellent qualities that I believe will tip the scales back in his favour. Howard Joel Wolowitz. H is for honesty, of which he has much. O's for outstanding, which he is such. W's for witty, he's quick with a joke. A's for artistic, his ability",4,Big Bang Theory,310,56
16778,Sheldon,7, But I still have rd Joel Wolowitz left to go.,4,Big Bang Theory,46,10
16780,Sheldon,7," I don't understand why you people are picking on my friend, Howard, when there are much more serious security threats to pursue. For instance, when I first met Leonard, he was on the verge of giving away rocket secrets to a North Korean spy, and not one agent ever investigated that.",4,Big Bang Theory,284,51
16782,Sheldon,7," No, it's a different Leonard. He's Chinese, red hair, six fingers. Good-bye.",4,Big Bang Theory,77,12
16784,Sheldon,7, Raj. Have you seen Howard?,4,Big Bang Theory,27,5
16785,Raj,7," I think he's eating lunch. Uh, Sheldon, I want you to meet Neil deGrasse Tyson from the Hayden Planetarium in New York.",4,Big Bang Theory,120,22
16786,Sheldon,7, I'm quite familiar with Dr. Tyson. He's responsible for the demotion of Pluto from planetary status. I liked Pluto. Ergo I do not like you.,4,Big Bang Theory,140,25
16788,Sheldon,7," If ifs and buts were candy and nuts, we'd all have a merry Christmas. Think about that, Dr. Tyson.",4,Big Bang Theory,99,19
16790,Raj,7," Oh, yeah.",4,Big Bang Theory,10,2
16792,Sheldon,7, Howard. The person at fault for you not getting a security clearance is me.,4,Big Bang Theory,76,14
16793,Howard,7, You?,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
16794,Sheldon,7," Yes, but before you get upset, I want you to know I went to the FBI and retracted my statement.",4,Big Bang Theory,96,20
16795,Howard,7, And they were okay with that?,4,Big Bang Theory,30,6
16796,Sheldon,7," No. If anything, I made it worse. In any case, I have been riddled with guilt, which is causing Gorn-infested REM sleep. So, I'm here now to say I'm sorry.",4,Big Bang Theory,156,30
16797,Howard,7," Are you kidding me? You've set my career back at least two years, and you think you can make it right with I'm sorry?",4,Big Bang Theory,118,24
16798,Sheldon,7," Yes. I followed the social protocol. I attempted to right the wrong, and when I failed to do so I delivered a heartfelt apology. Now you say apology accepted, and I will offer you a one-time-only high five.",4,Big Bang Theory,207,38
16799,Howard,7, Your apology is not accepted.,4,Big Bang Theory,30,5
16800,Sheldon,7," You're tricking me. It really is, isn't it?",4,Big Bang Theory,44,8
16801,Howard,7," Leave me alone, Sheldon.",4,Big Bang Theory,25,4
16803,Sheldon,7," Oh, shut up.",4,Big Bang Theory,13,3
16805,Penny,7, Sheldon?,4,Big Bang Theory,9,1
16806,Sheldon,7, Hello.,4,Big Bang Theory,7,1
16807,Penny,7, What are you doing here?,4,Big Bang Theory,25,5
16808,Sheldon,7," I have troubles, Penny. I've come to pour them out to the sympathetic ear of the local barkeep.",4,Big Bang Theory,96,18
16809,Penny,7," You know, they have a really nice bar over at the Olive Garden.",4,Big Bang Theory,64,13
16810,Sheldon,7, I don't like the Olive Garden. They treat me like family.,4,Big Bang Theory,58,11
16811,Penny,7," Okay, Sheldon. What can I get you?",4,Big Bang Theory,35,7
16812,Sheldon,7, Alcohol.,4,Big Bang Theory,9,1
16813,Penny,7, Could you be a little more specific?,4,Big Bang Theory,37,7
16814,Sheldon,7, Ethyl alcohol. 40 millilitres.,4,Big Bang Theory,31,4
16815,Penny,7," I'm sorry, honey, I don't know millilitres.",4,Big Bang Theory,44,7
16816,Sheldon,7, Ah. Blame President James â€œJimmyâ€ù Carter. He started America on a path to the metric system but then just gave up. He wonders why he was a one-term president.,4,Big Bang Theory,163,29
16817,Penny,7, Would you say that's about 40 milliliters?,4,Big Bang Theory,43,7
16818,Sheldon,7, More or less.,4,Big Bang Theory,14,3
16819,Penny,7," Great.  Now, where were we?",4,Big Bang Theory,28,5
16820,Sheldon,7," I believe you were about to ask me to choose a cocktail. Fortunately, thanks to computer-savvy alcoholics, there's an app for that. Let's see. Harvey Wallbanger. Eh. Sex on the Beach. I hardly think so. Rob Roy, Silk Slipper, Mad Hatter. Ooh! I'll have a Rosewater Ricky.",4,Big Bang Theory,272,47
16821,Penny,7, A what?,4,Big Bang Theory,8,2
16822,Sheldon,7," You'll need pitted, brandied cherries, gin, rosewater, angostura bitters and overproofed rum. Now, first, dust the cherries with sugar, then spray them with a mixture of rum and bitters. Then ignite the rum, caramel",4,Big Bang Theory,216,34
16823,Penny,7," Here you go, one Rosewater Ricky.",4,Big Bang Theory,34,6
16824,Sheldon,7, That's not how it looks in the picture.,4,Big Bang Theory,40,8
16825,Penny,7," Oh, yeah, you know, every bartender makes it differently. Why don't you give it a try.",4,Big Bang Theory,87,16
16826,Sheldon,7, All right. To the metric system.  I can't taste the cherries.,4,Big Bang Theory,62,11
16827,Penny,7," All right. Sheldon, what's on your mind?",4,Big Bang Theory,41,7
16828,Sheldon,7," I wronged Howard, and he won't accept my apology.",4,Big Bang Theory,50,9
16829,Penny,7," Oh, right, that. Yes, Leonard told me. Sorry, honey.",4,Big Bang Theory,53,9
16830,Sheldon,7," Penny, you face failure on a daily basis. How do you cope?",4,Big Bang Theory,59,12
16831,Penny,7, I drink.,4,Big Bang Theory,9,2
16832,Sheldon,7," To drinking.  Nope. Oh, if only there were some way to force Howard to accept my apology so I could escape this miasma of guilt.",4,Big Bang Theory,129,25
16833,Penny,7," You know, sometimes stuff just happens, and there's nothing you can do about it. For example, Lisa Peterson hasn't talked to me since the 11th grade, because no matter how much you apologize, you can't go back and un-dry-hump someone's boyfriend.",4,Big Bang Theory,247,41
16834,Sheldon,7," I see. You're saying I'm facing Starfleet Academy's unwinnable command scenario, the Kobayashi Maru.",4,Big Bang Theory,101,14
16835,Penny,7, Exactly. Sometimes you can't win.,4,Big Bang Theory,34,5
16836,Sheldon,7, Captain Kirk won.,4,Big Bang Theory,18,3
16837,Penny,7, Kirk cheated.,4,Big Bang Theory,14,2
16838,Sheldon,7, Impressive that you know that. It's hard to believe I'm actually having this conversation with you.,4,Big Bang Theory,100,16
16839,Penny,7, Right there with you.,4,Big Bang Theory,22,4
16840,Sheldon,7, Kirk beat the Kobayashi Maru by reprogramming the simulator. That's it.,4,Big Bang Theory,72,11
16841,Penny,7, What?,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
16842,Sheldon,7, I'll reprogram Howard.,4,Big Bang Theory,23,3
16843,Penny,7," What? Sheldon, you can't reprogram people.",4,Big Bang Theory,43,6
16844,Sheldon,7," No, you can't reprogram people. To James Tiberius Kirk. ",4,Big Bang Theory,57,9
16846,Sheldon,7," Hello, all.",4,Big Bang Theory,12,2
16847,Raj,7, Hello.,4,Big Bang Theory,7,1
16848,Leonard,7, Hey.,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
16849,Sheldon,7," Howard, you're feeling better about me today, aren't you?",4,Big Bang Theory,58,9
16850,Howard,7, Not really.,4,Big Bang Theory,12,2
16851,Sheldon,7," Yes, you are. I'm using neurolinguistic programming to modify your thought patterns.",4,Big Bang Theory,85,12
16852,Howard,7," Oh. Go away, Sheldon.",4,Big Bang Theory,22,4
16853,Sheldon,7, There's a nine ninety five e-book down the drain.,4,Big Bang Theory,50,9
16854,Raj,7, What's in the bag?,4,Big Bang Theory,19,4
16855,Sheldon,7, It's for Howard.,4,Big Bang Theory,17,3
16856,Howard,7," Oh. Sheldon, you can't fix this with gifts.",4,Big Bang Theory,44,8
16857,Sheldon,7," Nevertheless, I've hurt you, and whether you forgive me or not, I want you to have this.",4,Big Bang Theory,89,17
16858,Howard,7, You're giving me a couch cushion?,4,Big Bang Theory,34,6
16859,Sheldon,7, No. The cushion is merely symbolic. I'm giving you my spot on the couch.,4,Big Bang Theory,73,14
16860,Howard,7, But you love that spot.,4,Big Bang Theory,24,5
16861,Sheldon,7, No. I love my mother. My feelings for my spot are much greater. It is the singular location in space around which revolves my entire universe. And now it's yours.,4,Big Bang Theory,163,30
16862,Raj,7," Oh, my God, dude. Now you have to forgive him.",4,Big Bang Theory,47,10
16863,Howard,7, All right. Apology accepted.,4,Big Bang Theory,29,4
16864,Sheldon,7, High five. Not too hard. Thank you.,4,Big Bang Theory,36,7
16865,Raj,7, I haven't cried like this since Toy Story 3.,4,Big Bang Theory,45,9
16867,Howard,7," I got to tell you, Sheldon, I understand why you chose this spot. I mean, the temperature is good, but there's no draft. I can see the television, but I can still talk to",4,Big Bang Theory,171,34
16868,Sheldon,7, I changed my mind. Get out of my spot.,4,Big Bang Theory,39,9
16869,Penny,7, How long?,4,Big Bang Theory,10,2
16870,Leonard,7, 94 seconds.,4,Big Bang Theory,12,2
16872,Penny,8," Okay, help me out here. How does an archaeology professor get that good with a whip?",4,Big Bang Theory,85,16
16873,Howard,8, Maybe he took a class at the adult bookstore. That's how I learned.,4,Big Bang Theory,68,13
16874,Leonard,8, I can't believe you've never seen Raiders of the Lost Ark.,4,Big Bang Theory,59,11
16875,Penny,8," And I can't believe you've never read Eat, Pray, Love.",4,Big Bang Theory,55,10
16876,Leonard,8," When she comes out with Eat, Pray, Run Away From A Giant Boulder, I'll read it.",4,Big Bang Theory,80,16
16877,Howard,8," I don't care if Eat, Pray, Love changed your life, I'm not reading it.",4,Big Bang Theory,71,14
16878,Penny,8," You know, I could totally rock a hat like that.",4,Big Bang Theory,48,10
16879,Sheldon,8," That's the work of noted Hollywood costume designer Deborah Nadoolman. She also designed the iconic red and black jacket in Michael Jackson's Thriller video, which I've never viewed in its entirety, as I find zombies dancing in choreographed synchronicity implausible. And also, it's really scary.",4,Big Bang Theory,298,45
16880,Leonard,8, Would someone please turn off the Sheldon commentary track?,4,Big Bang Theory,60,9
16881,Sheldon,8, There's no switch. Just listen and learn.,4,Big Bang Theory,42,7
16882,Howard,8," Penny, if you think this is good, you should come with us Friday to see it on the big screen at the Colonial.",4,Big Bang Theory,110,23
16883,Penny,8," Well, I'm watching it now. Why would I want to see it again on Friday?",4,Big Bang Theory,71,15
16884,Sheldon,8, Because the print they're showing on Friday has an additional 21 seconds of previously unseen footage.,4,Big Bang Theory,103,16
16885,Penny,8," What, 21 seconds? That'll be like seeing a whole new movie!",4,Big Bang Theory,60,11
16886,Leonard,8, Exactly. They say it finally solves the submarine controversy.,4,Big Bang Theory,63,9
16887,Sheldon,8," Did Leonard? I'm no expert, but I believe what we just heard from Penny was sarcasm.  Oh, good. I'm eight for 26 this month.",4,Big Bang Theory,125,24
16888,Penny,8," Yeah, I think I'll pass. But you guys enjoy your extra 21 seconds.",4,Big Bang Theory,67,13
16889,Leonard,8," Bet if I could make you understand why this is such a cool thing, we'd still be together.",4,Big Bang Theory,90,18
16890,Penny,8," Mm, yeah, no, we wouldn't.",4,Big Bang Theory,27,5
16891,Howard,8," Uh-huh. I'm guessing 21 seconds had something to do with that, too.",4,Big Bang Theory,68,12
16893,Sheldon,8," May I point out to you all that the screening is first come, first served?",4,Big Bang Theory,75,15
16894,Leonard,8," Relax, it's five o'clock. The movie doesn't start till midnight.",4,Big Bang Theory,65,10
16895,Sheldon,8," Another way of saying that is the movie starts at midnight, and it's already five o'clock. Let's go.",4,Big Bang Theory,101,18
16896,Howard,8," You know, if we miss it, we'll have the fun of listening to Sheldon whine about it for the rest of our lives.",4,Big Bang Theory,110,23
16897,Sheldon,8, See? Howard's on my side.,4,Big Bang Theory,26,5
16898,Howard,8," Actually, I'm not. I'm using sarcasm to mock you.",4,Big Bang Theory,50,9
16899,Sheldon,8, Drat. Now I'm 8 for 27.,4,Big Bang Theory,24,6
16900,Leonard,8," Don't worry, Sheldon. We'll be fine.",4,Big Bang Theory,37,6
16901,Sheldon,8, But how were our seats?,4,Big Bang Theory,24,5
16902,Leonard,8, Excellent.,4,Big Bang Theory,11,1
16903,Sheldon,8," I rest my case. Amy, don't you agree we should leave now and get in line?",4,Big Bang Theory,74,16
16904,Amy,8," Actually, as the newest member of your social group, I believe I'll gain more acceptance by arbitrarily siding with your friends from time to time.",4,Big Bang Theory,148,25
16905,Sheldon,8, Shrewd.,4,Big Bang Theory,8,1
16906,Amy,8," Leonard, you're right. We should enjoy our meal, arrive late, and risk winding up with terrible seats, assuming we get in at all.",4,Big Bang Theory,130,23
16907,Leonard,8," Thank you, Amy.",4,Big Bang Theory,16,3
16908,Amy,8, See? It's working.,4,Big Bang Theory,19,3
16910,Howard,8, Who's there?,4,Big Bang Theory,13,2
16912,Howard,8," Olive you, too.",4,Big Bang Theory,16,3
16913,Leonard,8," Guys, that's really starting to get old.",4,Big Bang Theory,41,7
16914,Howard,8, Knock-knock.,4,Big Bang Theory,13,1
16915,Leonard,8, Who's there?,4,Big Bang Theory,13,2
16916,Howard,8, I have a girlfriend and you don't.,4,Big Bang Theory,35,7
16917,Leonard,8, Hysterical!,4,Big Bang Theory,12,1
16918,Sheldon,8," Wait, now, we don't know that yet. He isn't finished. I have a girlfriend and you don't who?",4,Big Bang Theory,93,18
16919,Howard,8, So. Are you sure you don't want to come with us to Raiders?,4,Big Bang Theory,60,13
16921,Amy,8, Girls' night? What does that entail?,4,Big Bang Theory,37,6
16923,Amy,8, I'm a girl.,4,Big Bang Theory,12,3
16925,Amy,8, No need. Penny and I are very close.,4,Big Bang Theory,37,8
16927,Amy,8," Yes. In fact, our menses are synchronized. Penny. Bernadette tells me you're planning a girls' night.",4,Big Bang Theory,102,16
16928,Penny,8, Yeah?,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
16929,Amy,8, I'm a girl.,4,Big Bang Theory,12,3
16930,Penny,8," Oh. Um, it was, it was just going to be me and Bernadette. Besides, I thought you were going to the movies with Sheldon and the guys.",4,Big Bang Theory,134,27
16931,Amy,8," Yes, but they're not girls. I'm a girl.",4,Big Bang Theory,40,8
16932,Penny,8," Yeah, no, no, I-I-I got that.",4,Big Bang Theory,30,6
16933,Amy,8, What's the dress code?,4,Big Bang Theory,23,4
16934,Penny,8," Uh, just wear something comfortable.",4,Big Bang Theory,37,5
16935,Amy,8, All right. I'll have to go shopping.,4,Big Bang Theory,37,7
16936,Sheldon,8, Knock-knock.,4,Big Bang Theory,13,1
16937,Leonard,8, Whoâ€˜s there?,4,Big Bang Theory,15,2
16938,Sheldon,8, Hugh.,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
16939,Leonard,8, Hugh who?,4,Big Bang Theory,10,2
16940,Sheldon,8, Hugh people need to listen to me. It's time to get in line for the movie. And that's how you tell a knock-knock joke.,4,Big Bang Theory,118,24
16942,Sheldon,8," Under normal circumstances I'd say, I told you so. But as I have told you so with such vehemence and frequency already, the phrase has lost all meaning. Therefore, I will be replacing it with the phrase I informed you thusly.",4,Big Bang Theory,226,41
16943,Howard,8, Ooh. Can't wait for that to start.,4,Big Bang Theory,35,7
16944,Sheldon,8, I informed you thusly.,4,Big Bang Theory,23,4
16945,Raj,8, Eight for 28.,4,Big Bang Theory,14,3
16946,Sheldon,8, This is where we could have been if we hadn't stopped for dinner. This is where we could have been if Koothrappali hadn't ordered dessert.,4,Big Bang Theory,139,25
16947,Raj,8," Well I earned it, dude, I ate all my broccoli.",4,Big Bang Theory,47,10
16948,Sheldon,8," And here's where we are. The runts in a large litter, unlikely to ever reach the nourishing teats of Indiana Jones.",4,Big Bang Theory,116,21
16949,Leonard,8, So I guess it's a good thing we stopped for dinner.,4,Big Bang Theory,52,11
16950,Raj,8," You know, guys, when facing disappointment, Eat, Pray, Love teaches usâ€“",4,Big Bang Theory,74,11
16951,Howard,8," Oh, shut up.",4,Big Bang Theory,13,3
16953,Amy,8," So anyway, to make a long story short, turns out I have an unusually firm cervix.",4,Big Bang Theory,82,16
16954,Penny,8," You know Amy, when we say girl talk, it doesn't just have to be about our lady parts.",4,Big Bang Theory,86,18
16955,Amy,8, Shame. â€˜Cause I have a real zinger about my titled uterus.,4,Big Bang Theory,61,11
16957,Penny,8," Oh, thanks. I found this place in Alhambra. It's in a woman's basement. I think it's a front",4,Big Bang Theory,93,18
16958,Amy,8, A colleague of mine did her graduate thesis on the fungus that grows on improperly sterilized manicure implements. Well don't tell me that's not girl talk.,4,Big Bang Theory,156,26
16959,Penny,8, So where should we go tonight? A bar? A club? A movie?,4,Big Bang Theory,55,12
16961,Amy,8," Yes, and continue to bond. I have a feeling that after tonight, one of you will become my best friend forever. Or BFF, if you prefer. Which I don't.",4,Big Bang Theory,149,29
16962,Penny,8," All right, time to open Bachelor Number Two.",4,Big Bang Theory,45,8
16964,Penny,8, That's okay. Y ou can just sleep here.,4,Big Bang Theory,39,8
16965,Amy,8," Oh, good, a slumber party! We'll do makeovers, initiate phony phone calls, and have spirited pillow fights in our frilly nighties!",4,Big Bang Theory,131,21
16966,Penny,8," Oh, gosh, Amy. I don't know if I would call this an actual slumber party.",4,Big Bang Theory,74,15
16967,Amy,8," Well, that's disappointing. I've always wanted to be invited to a slumber party.",4,Big Bang Theory,81,13
16969,Penny,8, Not even when you were a kid?,4,Big Bang Theory,30,7
16970,Amy,8," Well, there was the time I had my tonsils out, and I shared a room with a little Vietnamese girl. She didn't make it through the night, but up till then, it was kind of fun.",4,Big Bang Theory,174,36
16971,Penny,8," Okay. Well, I guess we're having a slumber party. Oh!",4,Big Bang Theory,54,10
16972,Amy,8, Pillow fight!,4,Big Bang Theory,14,2
16974,Leonard,8," Oh, I hope they let us in soon. I'm tired of running to the gas station to use the bathroom. The guy makes me buy a Gatorade every time. It's a vicious circle.",4,Big Bang Theory,160,33
16975,Howard,8, Too bad you don't have a stadium pal like me.,4,Big Bang Theory,46,10
16976,Leonard,8, What's a stadium pal?,4,Big Bang Theory,22,4
16977,Howard,8," Let me put it this way, takes care of the bathroom problem, and it keeps your calf warm.",4,Big Bang Theory,89,18
16978,Raj,8," Hey, guys, bad news. I just did a quick calculation. Given the size of the theatre and the length of this line, we might not get seats.",4,Big Bang Theory,136,27
16979,Sheldon,8, What did he say?,4,Big Bang Theory,17,4
16980,Leonard,8," Nice going, Raj, just got him down for his nap.",4,Big Bang Theory,48,10
16981,Sheldon,8, We might not get seats?,4,Big Bang Theory,24,5
16982,Leonard,8," It's fine, it's fine. Go back to sleep.",4,Big Bang Theory,40,8
16983,Sheldon,8," Oh, I informed you thusly. I so informed you thusly.",4,Big Bang Theory,53,10
16984,Leonard,8," Howard, you talk to him. Howard? You're peeing, aren't you?",4,Big Bang Theory,60,10
16986,Sheldon,8," Well, if it isn't Wil Wheaton, the Jar Jar Binks of the Star Trek universe.",4,Big Bang Theory,76,15
16988,Sheldon,8," Well, you-sa can go think that at the back of the line. No cuts, no buts, no coconuts.",4,Big Bang Theory,87,18
16992,Sheldon,8, Of what? Poorly executed beards?,4,Big Bang Theory,33,5
16996,Sheldon,8," This is Indiana Jones, not Star Trek. There should be no value to his pseudo-celebrity here. And even at Star Trek conventions, they only let him in if he helps set up.",4,Big Bang Theory,169,32
16997,Leonard,8," Calm down, Sheldon.",4,Big Bang Theory,20,3
16998,Sheldon,8," I will not calm down. This affront to justice and decency cannot go unanswered. As Captain Jean-Luc Picard once said, the line must be drawn here! This far, no farther!",4,Big Bang Theory,169,30
16999,Leonard,8," Had to wake him up from his nap, didn't you?",4,Big Bang Theory,45,10
17002,Penny,8, Howard has a hairy chest?,4,Big Bang Theory,26,5
17004,Penny,8," Okay, there you go, Sultry Sunrise Red. What do you think?",4,Big Bang Theory,59,11
17005,Amy,8, My nails have never looked so pretty before. Get it off.,4,Big Bang Theory,57,11
17007,Raj,8," Oh, oh, uh, looks like they're getting ready to let people in.",4,Big Bang Theory,63,12
17008,Sheldon,8," Listen to what Mr. Wil Wheaton is tweeting. Best seats in house for Raiders screening. Suck on that, Sheldon Cooper.",4,Big Bang Theory,117,20
17009,Leonard,8, Why do you read his Twitter feed? You know it's only going to upset you.,4,Big Bang Theory,73,15
17010,Sheldon,8," I believe in knowing my enemy, Leonard. Had Twitter existed at the time, would not General Custer have followed the tweets of Sitting Bull? Would not Lee have followed Grant? Would not Spy have followed Spy? I have more examples, but excuse me.  Hello. Well, this seems like an odd time to test my cell phone quality, but go on. Test phrases? All right. Imatote. Ulbu. Twad. All together? I'm a total buttwad. Why are you laughing? Hello?",4,Big Bang Theory,439,78
17012,Penny,8," And that, girls, is how you make a phony phone call.",4,Big Bang Theory,53,11
17013,Amy,8," I'm not sure I grasp the full entertainment value, but all right. Next on Wikipedia's list of slumber party activities, Truth or Dare.",4,Big Bang Theory,135,23
17014,Penny,8," Okay, it's your game. You go first.",4,Big Bang Theory,36,7
17015,Amy,8," Hang on. I'm familiarizing myself with the rules. Seems fairly straightforward. Bernadette, truth or dare?",4,Big Bang Theory,107,15
17017,Amy,8, All right. To what temperature must you heat beef in order to kill the prion that causes bovine spongiform encephalopathy?,4,Big Bang Theory,123,20
17019,Amy,8," Remember, you have to answer honestly.",4,Big Bang Theory,39,6
17020,Penny,8," Wait. No, Amy, you're supposed to ask her something personal or embarrassing.",4,Big Bang Theory,78,12
17021,Amy,8, Oh. All right. What is the circumference of your areolas?,4,Big Bang Theory,58,10
17023,Sheldon,8," Munching on complimentary popcorn. Woot, woot. Oh, the gall. I hope his next tweet is popcorn lodged in trachea, choking to death, woot, woot.",4,Big Bang Theory,143,24
17025,Sheldon,8, No!,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
17027,Leonard,8, We really want to see this. Is there anything you can do?,4,Big Bang Theory,58,12
17029,Sheldon,8, This is nothing but a blatant abuse of power by a petty functionary. Explain to me why Wil Wheaton and his lackeys get in and we don't.,4,Big Bang Theory,136,27
17031,Howard,8, I guess that's that. Let's go home.,4,Big Bang Theory,36,7
17032,Sheldon,8, You know what? I'm going back to I told you so. I told you so.,4,Big Bang Theory,63,15
17033,Raj,8," We can still see something. Uh, the new Sandra Bullock movie is playing two blocks away. You know Sandy B always brings it.",4,Big Bang Theory,124,23
17034,Sheldon,8," Look, a side door. Come on, Short Round.",4,Big Bang Theory,41,8
17035,Howard,8, I guess we'd better go after him.,4,Big Bang Theory,34,7
17036,Leonard,8, Short Round?,4,Big Bang Theory,13,2
17037,Raj,8, Indy's young sidekick from Temple of Doom.,4,Big Bang Theory,43,7
17038,Leonard,8," Yeah, I know who it is, but why is it me?",4,Big Bang Theory,42,11
17039,Raj,8, You're right. It should be a cuddly Asian boy. Like me.,4,Big Bang Theory,56,11
17041,Amy,8," And Absolon hath kist hir nether yea, and Nicholas is scalded in the towte. This tale is doon, and God save al the rowte.â€ù",4,Big Bang Theory,125,24
17042,Penny,8, What the hell was that?,4,Big Bang Theory,24,5
17043,Amy,8, Bernadette dared me to tell a dirty story. The Miller's Tale by Chaucer is the dirtiest story I know. It would have been hidden in sock drawers if people in the 14th century had worn socks.,4,Big Bang Theory,190,36
17045,Amy,8," You might not like it as much if you knew what nether yea meant. Hint, if one cares about hygiene, one ought not be kissing it.",4,Big Bang Theory,128,26
17047,Penny,8, Truth.,4,Big Bang Theory,7,1
17049,Amy,8," Oh, that's an excellent question. For two people who claim to be no longer pair-bonded, you spend an inordinate amount of time in each other's company.",4,Big Bang Theory,152,26
17051,Penny,8, Dare.,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
17052,Amy,8, I don't believe the rules allow for an ex post facto option change.,4,Big Bang Theory,68,13
17054,Penny,8," Okay, look, just because we're not seeing each other anymore doesn't mean we can't be friends. I mean, Leonard's a great guy.",4,Big Bang Theory,126,22
17055,Amy,8," Then, why did you terminate your relationship with him?",4,Big Bang Theory,56,9
17056,Penny,8," I don't know. He got really serious, and I wasn't ready for it.",4,Big Bang Theory,64,13
17057,Amy,8," Interesting. How will you react if, in the future, you become ready for it, and Leonard is unavailable, because another woman has realized that he is, to use your words, a great guy?",4,Big Bang Theory,183,33
17058,Penny,8, You can only ask one question.,4,Big Bang Theory,31,6
17060,Penny,8," You know what, I don't want to play anymore.",4,Big Bang Theory,45,9
17061,Amy,8," Well, I'm not sure how this is scored, but I believe we may have won.",4,Big Bang Theory,70,15
17063,Leonard,8, Sheldon? Sheldon?,4,Big Bang Theory,18,2
17064,Howard,8," Where did he go?  We're looking for Sheldon, not Marmaduke.",4,Big Bang Theory,60,10
17065,Sheldon,8, You whistled?,4,Big Bang Theory,14,2
17066,Leonard,8, What is that?,4,Big Bang Theory,14,3
17067,Sheldon,8," Raiders of the Lost Ark, with 21 additional seconds. If I can't see it, no one else can see it.",4,Big Bang Theory,96,20
17068,Leonard,8," Sheldon, this is crazy.",4,Big Bang Theory,24,4
17069,Sheldon,8, No. Crazy was leaving the projection booth unattended.,4,Big Bang Theory,55,8
17070,Leonard,8, Listen to me. You are over-tired. You're not thinking right. Put the movie back before we get into trouble.,4,Big Bang Theory,108,19
17071,Sheldon,8," Trouble is my middle name, Leonard. Actually, it's Lee, but I prefer Trouble.",4,Big Bang Theory,78,13
17073,Sheldon,8," Don't worry, Wil Wheaton. I was just leaving. Da-da-da-da, da-da-da!",4,Big Bang Theory,69,10
17074,Howard,8," Come on, Short Round.",4,Big Bang Theory,22,4
17075,Leonard,8, Yeah.,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
17077,Sheldon,8," Da-da-da-da, da-da-da!",4,Big Bang Theory,23,2
17078,Raj,8," Come on, guys! Hurry up! Hurry up!",4,Big Bang Theory,35,7
17079,Howard,8, Let's see you run with a bag of urine strapped to your leg.,4,Big Bang Theory,60,13
17081,Sheldon,8, Why is there never a pontoon plane when you need one?,4,Big Bang Theory,54,11
17084,Amy,8," Clearly, losing Truth or Dare upset her. Perhaps we should try to take her mind off it with another popular slumber party activity.",4,Big Bang Theory,132,23
17086,Amy,8," Well, the Internet suggests that slumber party guests often engage in harmless experimentation with lesbianism.",4,Big Bang Theory,112,15
17088,Amy,8, Penny?,4,Big Bang Theory,7,1
17089,Penny,8," Oh, hey, Amy. Look, I'm sorry I got so upset. I just,whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,whoa! What are you doing?",4,Big Bang Theory,126,23
17090,Amy,8, Don't worry. I'll avoid the nether yea.,4,Big Bang Theory,40,7
17093,Raj,9, You know who's got to be the bravest person in the Marvel Universe? Whoever has to give She-Hulk a bikini wax.,4,Big Bang Theory,111,21
17094,Howard,9," You want to talk brave, how about Captain America's undocumented Mexican gardener?",4,Big Bang Theory,83,12
17095,Leonard,9, He's not braver than whoever uses the bathroom after The Thing?,4,Big Bang Theory,64,11
17096,Sheldon,9," As usual, you're all wrong. The bravest person in the Marvel Universe is the doctor who gives Wolverine his prostate exam.",4,Big Bang Theory,123,21
17097,Howard,9, How about the guy who gets a prostate exam from Wolverine?,4,Big Bang Theory,59,11
17098,Sheldon,9," Now you just being silly. Wolverine's never displayed the slightest interest in helping others prevent prostate cancer.  Hello. Yes, the elevator's out of order you'll have to use the stairs. Of course you can. Pizza dates back to the 16th century, while the first elevator was not installed until 1852. That means that for over 300 years, people carried pizzas up stairs. Be part of that proud tradition.",4,Big Bang Theory,406,68
17099,Leonard,9, I'll go get Penny while that guy spits on our food.,4,Big Bang Theory,52,11
17100,Raj,9, Do you think they gave Wolverine an Adamantium prostate?,4,Big Bang Theory,57,9
17101,Howard,9, That's a stupid question.,4,Big Bang Theory,26,4
17102,Raj,9, We're having a conversation about probing the heinies of superheroes. There are no stupid questions.,4,Big Bang Theory,101,15
17105,Leonard,9," Oh, um, is Penny here?",4,Big Bang Theory,23,5
17107,Leonard,9, Yeah.,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
17109,Leonard,9," Okay, I think a bit of context here might help.",4,Big Bang Theory,48,10
17110,Penny,9," Oh, hey, Leonard. I see you met my dad.",4,Big Bang Theory,40,9
17111,Leonard,9," Oh, good. Context.",4,Big Bang Theory,19,3
17113,Penny,9," Oh, gee, dad, Leonard can't stay. He just dropped by to say hello. Thanks for stopping by, sweetie. I'll see you later.  Bye.",4,Big Bang Theory,126,23
17114,Leonard,9, That was odd.,4,Big Bang Theory,14,3
17116,Sheldon,9," Are you sure you have enough comics? You're going to be monitoring the telescope for 12 hours, and by my estimate, you've only selected seven hours of reading material. That's even factoring in your difficulty in parsing American comic book idioms like Bamf and Snikt.",4,Big Bang Theory,269,45
17117,Raj,9, Is that racist? It feels racist.,4,Big Bang Theory,33,6
17118,Howard,9," Don't be oversensitive. He's calling you illiterate, not your race.",4,Big Bang Theory,68,10
17119,Raj,9," Oh, okay. Good. I don't need more comics. Howard's gonna stop by, we're gonna play intergalactic battleship and Indian Monopoly.",4,Big Bang Theory,129,20
17120,Sheldon,9," I don't care for novelty editions of Monopoly. I prefer the classics, regular and Klingon.",4,Big Bang Theory,91,15
17121,Howard,9," Actually, Indian Monopoly's just like regular, except the money's in Rupees, instead of hotels you build call centers, and when you pick a chance card, you might die of dysentery. Just FYI, that was racist.",4,Big Bang Theory,207,35
17122,Leonard,9, You'll never guess what just happened.,4,Big Bang Theory,39,6
17123,Sheldon,9," You went out in the hallway, stumbled into an interdimensional portal which brought you 5,000 years into the future, where you took advantage of the advanced technology to build a time machine, and now you're back to bring us all with you to the year 7010 where we are transported to work at the thinkatorium by telepathically controlled flying dolphins?",4,Big Bang Theory,355,60
17124,Leonard,9, No.,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
17125,Sheldon,9, Aw.,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
17126,Leonard,9, Penny kissed me.,4,Big Bang Theory,17,3
17127,Sheldon,9," Well, who would ever guess that?",4,Big Bang Theory,33,6
17128,Raj,9, What what kind of a kiss?,4,Big Bang Theory,26,6
17129,Leonard,9, A big kiss. On the mouth.,4,Big Bang Theory,26,6
17130,Howard,9, Is it possible that she was going for your cheek and you moved and she accidentally got lip? That happens with me and my mom all the time.,4,Big Bang Theory,139,28
17131,Leonard,9," She introduced me to her father, kissed me and then shut the door in my face.",4,Big Bang Theory,78,16
17132,Howard,9,Maybe she was trying to send you a message.,4,Big Bang Theory,43,9
17133,Leonard,9, You think?,4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
17134,Howard,9, Yeah. This man is not my father. I'm being held hostage. So I'm going to do something insane in the hopes that you'll call 911.,4,Big Bang Theory,128,25
17135,Leonard,9, Penny kissing me is not insane. She used to kiss me all the time.,4,Big Bang Theory,66,14
17136,Sheldon,9," Einstein defined insanity as doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. By that standard, Penny is cuckoo for cocoa puffs.",4,Big Bang Theory,154,25
17137,Leonard,9," I'm just saying, it felt like it may have meant something.",4,Big Bang Theory,59,11
17138,Howard,9," Ah, this takes me back. Leonard obsessing about Penny. I mean, don't get me wrong, I love your new stuff, but once in a while it's nice to hear the hits.",4,Big Bang Theory,154,31
17139,Raj,9," Ooh, ooh! Do our babies will be smart and beautiful. That one always makes me laugh.",4,Big Bang Theory,85,16
17140,Leonard,9, Why do I bother talking to you people?,4,Big Bang Theory,39,8
17141,Sheldon,9," If it'll make you feel better, we rarely listen.",4,Big Bang Theory,49,9
17142,Penny,9," Hey, can I talk to you out here for a sec?",4,Big Bang Theory,43,11
17143,Leonard,9," Yeah, sure.",4,Big Bang Theory,12,2
17144,Sheldon,9, I'm starting to think we're never going to see that pizza.,4,Big Bang Theory,59,11
17145,Penny,9, So you're probably wondering what that was all about.,4,Big Bang Theory,54,9
17146,Leonard,9," What, uh, the kissing and everything? Nah, women do that to me all the time.",4,Big Bang Theory,77,15
17147,Penny,9," Yeah, okay. The thing is, I kind of told my father we got back together again.",4,Big Bang Theory,79,16
17148,Leonard,9, What? Why?,4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
17149,Penny,9," Well, you're the first guy he's ever really approved of, you know? You're a scientist who went to college and you don't have a neck tattoo or outstanding warrants or, or a baby.",4,Big Bang Theory,178,33
17150,Leonard,9, What kind of guys did you used to go out with?,4,Big Bang Theory,47,11
17151,Penny,9," Just guys. Anyway, when I told him we split up, he was heartbroken, and he kept bugging me, how's Leonard? why can't you get back together with Leonard? I bet Leonard never tipped a cow over on himself. So to get him off my back, I told him we worked things out.",4,Big Bang Theory,263,52
17152,Leonard,9," Really? How, how'd we manage that?",4,Big Bang Theory,35,6
17153,Penny,9, What?,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
17154,Leonard,9," Well, did you apologize? Did you have to woo me?",4,Big Bang Theory,49,10
17155,Penny,9," Get over yourself. I whistled, you came running.",4,Big Bang Theory,49,8
17156,Leonard,9," Yeah, no, I don't think so.",4,Big Bang Theory,28,6
17157,Penny,9," Okay, why are you arguing about this?",4,Big Bang Theory,38,7
17158,Leonard,9," I'm just saying, if we fake got back together, that's totally not how it fake happened.",4,Big Bang Theory,88,16
17159,Penny,9," Oh, okay, whatever. Will you please just play along until my dad leaves?",4,Big Bang Theory,73,13
17160,Leonard,9," Hold on, you actually want me to deceive your father with some sort of sham play acting and kissing? Cause I'm good with that.",4,Big Bang Theory,127,24
17162,Penny,9," Come on, honey, not in front of my dad.",4,Big Bang Theory,40,9
17164,Leonard,9, See? He doesn't mind.,4,Big Bang Theory,22,4
17166,Penny,9," Oh, dad, that's nice, but Leonard has to work. Right, Leonard?",4,Big Bang Theory,63,11
17167,Leonard,9," Uh, I do, I have to work. But I'm gonna blow that off to spend the evening with my sweetie and her father, 'cause, you know, just the kind of boyfriend I am.",4,Big Bang Theory,158,33
17168,Penny,9, Oh.,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
17169,Leonard,9," Come here, you.",4,Big Bang Theory,16,3
17171,Howard,9, C-7.,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
17172,Raj,9, Miss.,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
17173,Howard,9," How could that be a miss? C-6 was a hit, C-8 was a hit. Part of your starship has to be on C-7.",4,Big Bang Theory,96,23
17174,Raj,9, Not if it has a hole in the middle.,4,Big Bang Theory,36,9
17175,Howard,9, What kind of spaceship has a hole in the middle?,4,Big Bang Theory,49,10
17176,Raj,9, A Romulan battle bagel?,4,Big Bang Theory,24,4
17178,Howard,9," Oh, great, you made it. Come on in. I invited her.",4,Big Bang Theory,51,11
17180,Howard,9," It's in Hawaii, but Raj controls it from here. He's hoping to see Epsilon Eridani dim, which would be evidence of a planet orbiting it.",4,Big Bang Theory,136,25
17182,Howard,9," I did it with you when we rented The Notebook.  Yes, Gena Rowlands is a treasure. You'd better open up that bottle of wine or I'm gonna end up with swimmer's ear.",4,Big Bang Theory,163,32
17183,Raj,9," Excuse me. I can't be drinking, I'm about to make an important scientific discovery here.",4,Big Bang Theory,90,15
17184,Howard,9, What? Galileo did his best work while drinking wine.,4,Big Bang Theory,53,9
17185,Raj,9, How do you know that?,4,Big Bang Theory,22,5
17186,Howard,9," Well, he was Italian. It's a reasonable assumption.",4,Big Bang Theory,52,8
17187,Raj,9," Dude, can you even open your mouth without spewing a cultural stereotype?",4,Big Bang Theory,74,12
17188,Howard,9," Oh, I, I'm sorry, Galileo drank diet sprite. Look, you're my best friend, she's my girlfriend, you should bond. You know, like you and my mom did.",4,Big Bang Theory,147,27
17189,Raj,9, Your mom creeps the hell out of me.,4,Big Bang Theory,36,8
17190,Howard,9," Yes, but she's stopped calling you slumdog millionaire.",4,Big Bang Theory,56,8
17191,Raj,9, I do appreciate that.,4,Big Bang Theory,22,4
17193,Howard,9, Well I'd like to propose a toast. To science and friendship.,4,Big Bang Theory,61,11
17195,Howard,9, What?,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
17198,Leonard,9," Thanks for the steak, Wyatt.",4,Big Bang Theory,29,5
17200,Penny,9," So not funny, dad.",4,Big Bang Theory,19,4
17202,Penny,9," Oh, will you please let it go?",4,Big Bang Theory,31,7
17204,Leonard,9, A lot of people are doing that.,4,Big Bang Theory,32,7
17205,Penny,9," Oh, see?",4,Big Bang Theory,9,2
17207,Penny,9," Yeah, that's great. It's a funny story. Moving on.",4,Big Bang Theory,51,9
17209,Penny,9," Curtis, and I'm pretty sure he was joking.",4,Big Bang Theory,43,8
17211,Penny,9," Yeah, okay, I think this ends the ex-boyfriend portion of our evening.",4,Big Bang Theory,71,12
17213,Leonard,9," Thanks, Wyatt. I'm a keeper.",4,Big Bang Theory,29,5
17216,Penny,9," Oh, gee, dad, he'd love to, but Leonard has to work in the morning.",4,Big Bang Theory,68,14
17217,Leonard,9, Maybe I could go in a little late.,4,Big Bang Theory,35,8
17218,Penny,9," No, no, no, you can't. Your career is far too important.",4,Big Bang Theory,57,11
17220,Leonard,9, Don't I know it.,4,Big Bang Theory,17,4
17222,Leonard,9," Good night, Wyatt. Oh, good night, honey.",4,Big Bang Theory,42,7
17223,Penny,9, Good night.,4,Big Bang Theory,12,2
17224,Leonard,9, I love you.,4,Big Bang Theory,12,3
17225,Penny,9," Love you, too.",4,Big Bang Theory,15,3
17226,Sheldon,9," Oh, friggety-frak. Not this again.",4,Big Bang Theory,35,5
17228,Howard,9," Three, four, five, pass go, get 2,000 Rupees, Six, seven, whoops. Can't go any further. There's a sacred cow in my way.",4,Big Bang Theory,120,22
17229,Raj,9," Bernadette, please tell your boyfriend to cool it with the cow jokes.",4,Big Bang Theory,70,12
17231,Raj,9, Yeah. Like his haircut material.,4,Big Bang Theory,33,5
17233,Raj,9, No. I got them all cut.,4,Big Bang Theory,24,6
17235,Raj,9," And when you go to a Chinese restaurant, he always gets the same fortune in his fortune cookie.",4,Big Bang Theory,96,18
17237,Howard,9," Okay, I think that's enough about me.",4,Big Bang Theory,38,7
17238,Raj,9," He's right. Let's make fun of his mother. Howard, come rub my feet! My corns are killing me!",4,Big Bang Theory,93,18
17241,Leonard,9," Coming. Hey, lovebug.",4,Big Bang Theory,22,3
17242,Penny,9, Shut up. You know what I've been doing for the last hour?,4,Big Bang Theory,58,12
17243,Leonard,9," Mm, dreamily doodling Mrs. Leonard Hofstadter in a notebook?",4,Big Bang Theory,61,9
17244,Penny,9, Listening to my father go on and on about what a great guy you are.,4,Big Bang Theory,68,15
17245,Leonard,9," You got to admit, I am, I'm delightful.",4,Big Bang Theory,40,8
17246,Penny,9, Why are you making this so difficult?,4,Big Bang Theory,38,7
17247,Leonard,9, It's not difficult for me. I'm having fun.,4,Big Bang Theory,43,8
17248,Penny,9, Leonard.,4,Big Bang Theory,9,1
17249,Leonard,9, What do you want me to do? You started this. Do you want to go over and tell him we're broken up?,4,Big Bang Theory,98,22
17250,Penny,9, No.,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
17251,Leonard,9," Well, then, what do you want?",4,Big Bang Theory,30,6
17252,Penny,9, I don't know.,4,Big Bang Theory,14,3
17253,Leonard,9, Don't you think that's something you should have figured out before you stomped over here?,4,Big Bang Theory,91,15
17254,Penny,9, Maybe.,4,Big Bang Theory,7,1
17255,Sheldon,9," Leonard, Penny, excellent. I'd like to say I'm very happy that you're back together, and if I can figure out a way to do so and sound sincere, I will. In the meantime, I'd like to go over some proposed changes to the roommate agreement specifically to address Penny's annoying personal habits.",4,Big Bang Theory,294,52
17256,Penny,9," Oh, my God. What personal habits?",4,Big Bang Theory,34,6
17257,Leonard,9," I have a list. FYI, overuse of the phrase, oh, my god, is number 12.",4,Big Bang Theory,69,15
17258,Penny,9," Okay, Sheldon, you don't have to do this because Leonard and I are not",4,Big Bang Theory,71,14
17259,Leonard,9, Ba-ba-ba-ba. Are you sure you want to include him in this?,4,Big Bang Theory,59,11
17260,Sheldon,9, Include me in what? Is there a plot afoot? I'll have no truck with plots.,4,Big Bang Theory,74,15
17261,Penny,9," No, you're right. No, there's, there's no plots, no trucks, no feet. So what other annoying habits shall we discuss?",4,Big Bang Theory,117,20
17262,Sheldon,9," Uh, we don't discuss anything. Leonard is the signatory to the Roommate Agreement. As such, he bears responsibility for all your infractions and must pay all fines.",4,Big Bang Theory,165,27
17263,Leonard,9, Fines?,4,Big Bang Theory,7,1
17264,Sheldon,9," Yes. If Penny's going to be spending nights here again, you'll need to set up an escrow account. Sign here.",4,Big Bang Theory,108,20
17266,Raj,9," Hello, Hawaii. This is Dr. Koothrappali in Pasadena. I'd like you to reposition the telescope, please. Scarlett Johansson's house! I'm kidding, Hawaii. Mahalo. Whoo!",4,Big Bang Theory,166,24
17267,Howard,9, It might have been a mistake to open that second bottle of wine.,4,Big Bang Theory,65,13
17269,Raj,9," Maybe. If it did, I'd be famous. I'd be on the cover of magazines. And then, instead of living alone in my tiny apartment, I'd have a big mansion.",4,Big Bang Theory,147,29
17271,Raj,9," It is. If you like wandering around a big, empty house with no one to love you.",4,Big Bang Theory,80,17
17272,Howard,9, We'd come visit you.,4,Big Bang Theory,21,4
17273,Raj,9," No, you wouldn't. You'd be intimidated by my wealth and fame. My only friends would be my genetically engineered monkey butler, and the little people I hired to be my living chess set.",4,Big Bang Theory,185,33
17275,Howard,9, Hold on. He could come back.,4,Big Bang Theory,29,6
17276,Raj,9," Oh, what's the point of everything?",4,Big Bang Theory,36,6
17277,Howard,9, Nope. He's gone.,4,Big Bang Theory,17,3
17278,Raj,9, You know it's been more than a year since I've even kissed a girl?,4,Big Bang Theory,67,14
17279,Howard,9, What about that hook-up at Comic-Con you told me about?,4,Big Bang Theory,56,10
17280,Raj,9," Oh, grow up. I was lying. I lie all the time. Nobody wants to kiss me.",4,Big Bang Theory,71,16
17282,Raj,9, Where?,4,Big Bang Theory,7,1
17284,Howard,9, No!,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
17288,Leonard,9," Oh, b-be careful. Give him some line. Okay, now reel him in.",4,Big Bang Theory,61,12
17290,Leonard,9, Yeah. They do that when you set it on easy.,4,Big Bang Theory,44,10
17292,Leonard,9," Hey, baby. I love you! Mwuh, mwuh, mwuh, mwuh, mwuh.",4,Big Bang Theory,53,10
17294,Leonard,9," Oh, hey. There's been something I've been meaning to tell you.",4,Big Bang Theory,63,11
17297,Leonard,9," Just for the record, I did not want to be a part of this.",4,Big Bang Theory,58,14
17299,Leonard,9, No hurry.,4,Big Bang Theory,10,2
17301,Penny,9," I'm sorry, daddy",4,Big Bang Theory,17,3
17303,Penny,9, Oh.,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
17305,Penny,9," You know, I'm sorry.",4,Big Bang Theory,21,4
17307,Penny,9," You're right. Look, from now on, I will tell you the truth.",4,Big Bang Theory,60,12
17309,Penny,9," Daddy, he had nothing to do",4,Big Bang Theory,28,6
17311,Penny,9, Okay.,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
17313,Leonard,9, What?,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
17315,Leonard,9," Gee, I don't know if it's in the cards, sir.",4,Big Bang Theory,45,10
17317,Leonard,9, I'll give it a shot.,4,Big Bang Theory,21,5
17319,Leonard,9, Excuse me?,4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
17321,Leonard,9," Oh, the reverse psychology thing. I see. That's very clever.",4,Big Bang Theory,61,10
17323,Leonard,9, I'll friend you on Facebook.,4,Big Bang Theory,29,5
17325,Sheldon,9," Oh, there you are. Just so you know, I was up all night, but I have finally completed the Penny-specific section of the new roommate agreement.",4,Big Bang Theory,144,26
17326,Leonard,9," Yeah, well, not necessary. We broke up again.",4,Big Bang Theory,46,8
17327,Sheldon,9," Do you even think about other people, Leonard? Do you?",4,Big Bang Theory,55,10
17329,Raj,9, Hey.,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
17330,Leonard,9," Oh, how'd it go last night?",4,Big Bang Theory,28,6
17331,Raj,9," Oh, you know. Same old, same old. Looked through a telescope, saw some stars. Big whoop.",4,Big Bang Theory,89,16
17332,Leonard,9, Really? You waited months for time with that telescope. What happened?,4,Big Bang Theory,71,11
17333,Raj,9, Why? You writing a book?,4,Big Bang Theory,25,5
17334,Sheldon,9," I'm going to propose a hypothesis. Last night, Raj accidentally made contact with an alien civilization and has been ordered by the United States government to keep it a secret.",4,Big Bang Theory,178,30
17335,Raj,9, Nothing happened. Can we please just change the subject?,4,Big Bang Theory,57,9
17336,Sheldon,9, That sounds rehearsed. We are not alone.,4,Big Bang Theory,41,7
17337,Howard,9, Hey.,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
17338,Leonard,9, Hey.,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
17339,Sheldon,9, Hello.,4,Big Bang Theory,7,1
17340,Howard,9, Hey.,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
17341,Raj,9, Hey.,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
17342,Leonard,9, You get to play with Raj's big telescope last night?,4,Big Bang Theory,53,10
17343,Howard,9, Whoa. Where did that come from?,4,Big Bang Theory,32,6
17344,Raj,9, He never touched my telescope.,4,Big Bang Theory,31,5
17345,Howard,9, Way to go shutting up.,4,Big Bang Theory,23,5
17346,Raj,9, I did shut up. Now you shut up.,4,Big Bang Theory,32,8
17347,Howard,9, Fine.,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
17348,Raj,9, Thank you. How come you didn't call me this morning?,4,Big Bang Theory,53,10
17350,Sheldon,10, Clarify something for me. Isn't the point of a communal meal the exchange of ideas and opinions? An opportunity to consider important issues of the day?,4,Big Bang Theory,153,26
17351,Leonard,10," It is. You just kind of put a damper on things when you said, the next person I see talking with food in their mouth will be put to death.",4,Big Bang Theory,139,30
17352,Sheldon,10," Well, we could argue about who said what all night long, but to set things back on course, I will propose a new topic of conversation.",4,Big Bang Theory,135,26
17353,Leonard,10, Great.,4,Big Bang Theory,7,1
17354,Sheldon,10," What is the best number? By the way, there's only one correct answer.",4,Big Bang Theory,70,13
17355,Raj,10," Five million, three hundred eighteen thousand and eight?",4,Big Bang Theory,57,8
17356,Sheldon,10, Wrong. The best number is 73. You're probably wondering why.,4,Big Bang Theory,61,10
17357,Leonard,10, No.,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
17358,Howard,10, Uh-uh.,4,Big Bang Theory,7,1
17359,Raj,10, We're good.,4,Big Bang Theory,12,2
17360,Sheldon,10," 73 is the 21st prime number. Its mirror, 37, is the 12th, and its mirror, 21, is the product of multiplying, hang on to your hats, seven and three. Eh? Eh? Did I lie?",4,Big Bang Theory,167,34
17361,Leonard,10, We get it. 73 is the Chuck Norris of numbers.,4,Big Bang Theory,46,10
17362,Sheldon,10," Chuck Norris wishes. In binary, 73 is a palindrome, one-zero-zero-one-zero-zero-one which backwards is one-zero-zero-one-zero-zero-one, exactly the same. All Chuck Norris backwards gets you is Sirron Kcuhc.",4,Big Bang Theory,207,26
17363,Raj,10," Just for the record, when you enter five million three hundred eighteen thousand and eight in a calculator, upside-down it spells boobies.",4,Big Bang Theory,139,22
17364,Leonard,10, Remember when you were wondering why the girls didn't want to eat with us tonight?,4,Big Bang Theory,83,15
17365,Howard,10," Yeah, I get it now.",4,Big Bang Theory,20,5
17367,Penny,10," I love your little heart locket, Bernadette.",4,Big Bang Theory,45,7
17369,Amy,10," Did you know that the iconic Valentine's heart shape is not actually based on the shape of a human heart, but rather on the shape of the buttocks of a female bending over?",4,Big Bang Theory,172,33
17370,Penny,10," Oh, so I spent seventh grade dotting my I's with little asses? Cool.",4,Big Bang Theory,69,13
17372,Penny,10," Hey, Zack, what are you doing here?",4,Big Bang Theory,36,7
17374,Penny,10," Yeah, I got it, I got it. Uh, Zack, these are my friends Bernadette and Amy.",4,Big Bang Theory,77,16
17377,Amy,10, Hoo.,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
17379,Penny,10," Yeah, you, too.",4,Big Bang Theory,16,3
17381,Penny,10," Oh, we went out a couple of times.",4,Big Bang Theory,35,8
17382,Amy,10, I'm often flummoxed by current slang. Does went out mean had intercourse?,4,Big Bang Theory,74,12
17384,Penny,10," No, no. But in this case, yes.",4,Big Bang Theory,31,7
17385,Amy,10, Interesting. And was it not satisfactory?,4,Big Bang Theory,42,6
17386,Penny,10," No, it was great. He just didn't really challenge me on an intellectual level.",4,Big Bang Theory,79,14
17388,Penny,10, Wouldn't help. Zack can't even spell NPR.,4,Big Bang Theory,42,7
17390,Amy,10, Hoo.,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
17392,Amy,10," I'm suddenly feeling flushed. My heart rate is elevated, my palms are clammy, my mouth is dry. In addition, I keep involuntarily saying hoo.",4,Big Bang Theory,141,24
17393,Penny,10," Oh, we know what's causing that, don't we?",4,Big Bang Theory,43,8
17394,Amy,10, It's no mystery. I obviously have the flu coupled with sudden-onset Tourette's syndrome.,4,Big Bang Theory,89,13
17396,Howard,10, Did you hear about the accident at the bio lab?,4,Big Bang Theory,48,10
17397,Leonard,10, No. What happened?,4,Big Bang Theory,19,3
17398,Howard,10, They were injecting rats with radioactive isotopes and one of the techs got bit.,4,Big Bang Theory,81,14
17399,Raj,10, Did he get superpowers?,4,Big Bang Theory,24,4
17400,Howard,10," No, he got five stitches and a tetanus shot.",4,Big Bang Theory,45,9
17401,Raj,10," Oh. Well, that's disappointing.",4,Big Bang Theory,32,4
17402,Howard,10, Why?,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
17403,Raj,10," Well, you get bit by a radioactive animal in a lab, you kind of want to turn into a superhero.",4,Big Bang Theory,95,20
17404,Howard,10," Yeah, but who'd want to become Rat-Man?",4,Big Bang Theory,40,7
17405,Raj,10," Who wouldn't? You could zip through a maze in nothing flat, squeeze through really small holes, and shut down restaurants in a single bound. And the best part is, if I were Rat-Man, you could be my sidekick, Mouse Boy.",4,Big Bang Theory,219,40
17406,Howard,10, Mouse Boy?,4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
17407,Raj,10," You don't like Mouse Boy? How about, uh, uh, Kid Vermin?",4,Big Bang Theory,57,11
17408,Howard,10," First of all, if we had superpowers, I wouldn't be the sidekick. You'd be the sidekick.",4,Big Bang Theory,88,16
17409,Raj,10, Rat-Man is nobody's sidekick.,4,Big Bang Theory,30,4
17410,Howard,10," Leonard, settle this. Of the two of us, who's the obvious sidekick?",4,Big Bang Theory,68,12
17411,Raj,10," Yeah, Leonard, who?",4,Big Bang Theory,20,3
17412,Leonard,10," 12 years after high school, and I'm still at the nerd table.",4,Big Bang Theory,61,12
17414,Sheldon,10, Aren't you slicing that man's brain a little too thin?,4,Big Bang Theory,55,10
17415,Amy,10," It's too thin if I were making a foot-long brain sandwich at Quiznos. For examination under a two-photon microscope, it's fine.",4,Big Bang Theory,128,21
17416,Sheldon,10," Well, you're the expert. If the correct way to do it is the wrong way, then I yield.",4,Big Bang Theory,85,18
17417,Amy,10," Very well. If you die and donate your body to science, I promise to slice your brain like Canadian bacon.",4,Big Bang Theory,106,20
17418,Sheldon,10, Thank you.,4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
17419,Amy,10," Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to take my temperature.",4,Big Bang Theory,57,11
17420,Sheldon,10," Are you monitoring your circadian rhythms in order to identify your periods of maximum mental acuity? I did that one summer. Ah, youth.",4,Big Bang Theory,136,23
17421,Amy,10," No, I experienced some distressing symptoms last night, so I'm checking my vital signs every hour.",4,Big Bang Theory,99,16
17422,Sheldon,10, I'd be happy to create a chart and participate in a differential diagnosis.,4,Big Bang Theory,76,13
17423,Amy,10," Oh, that sounds like fun.",4,Big Bang Theory,26,5
17424,Sheldon,10, All right. What were the symptoms?,4,Big Bang Theory,35,6
17425,Amy,10," Elevated heart rate, moist palms, dry mouth and localized vascular throbbing.",4,Big Bang Theory,78,11
17426,Sheldon,10, Localized to what region?,4,Big Bang Theory,26,4
17427,Amy,10, Ears and genitalia.,4,Big Bang Theory,20,3
17428,Sheldon,10, Interesting. Not body parts that usually team up. What about environmental factors? Describe the scene for me.,4,Big Bang Theory,111,17
17429,Amy,10," I was sitting in a restaurant with Penny and Bernadette, drinking water, carbonated as it was a special occasion. Penny's friend Zack stopped by and said hello and I said hoo.",4,Big Bang Theory,176,31
17430,Sheldon,10, Who?,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
17431,Amy,10, Zack.,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
17432,Sheldon,10, Then why did you ask?,4,Big Bang Theory,22,5
17433,Amy,10, Ask what?,4,Big Bang Theory,10,2
17434,Sheldon,10, Who.,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
17435,Amy,10, Zack.,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
17436,Sheldon,10," All right, let's start over. What did you say when Zack walked in?",4,Big Bang Theory,67,13
17437,Amy,10, Hoo.,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
17438,Sheldon,10, Zack.,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
17439,Amy,10, Why do you keep saying Zack?,4,Big Bang Theory,29,6
17440,Sheldon,10, Because you keep saying who.,4,Big Bang Theory,29,5
17441,Amy,10, I'm not saying hoo now. I said hoo last night.,4,Big Bang Theory,47,10
17442,Sheldon,10," And the answer was Zack, correct?",4,Big Bang Theory,34,6
17443,Amy,10, There was no question. I simply said hoo.,4,Big Bang Theory,42,8
17444,Sheldon,10," All right, I think I have enough to go on. Possible explanations for your symptoms are, in descending order of likelihood, hyperthyroidism, premature menopause, hosting an alien parasite or, and I only include it for the sake of covering absolutely all bases, sexual arousal.",4,Big Bang Theory,276,44
17445,Amy,10, Where would I have picked up an alien parasite?,4,Big Bang Theory,48,9
17447,Howard,10, There you are.,4,Big Bang Theory,15,3
17448,Raj,10," Oh, hey.",4,Big Bang Theory,9,2
17449,Howard,10, Let me ask you a question. What are you most afraid of?,4,Big Bang Theory,56,12
17450,Raj,10," I don't know. Um, nuclear war. Accidentally being buried alive. Any of those movies where you get that phone call that says you're going to die, and then you do.",4,Big Bang Theory,162,30
17451,Howard,10," No. Something very specific that we both know you, Rajesh Koothrappali, are terrified of.",4,Big Bang Theory,90,14
17452,Raj,10," Well, type two diabetes runs in my family. The thought of losing a toe",4,Big Bang Theory,71,14
17453,Howard,10, Spiders! You're afraid of spiders!,4,Big Bang Theory,35,5
17454,Raj,10, What the heck is this?,4,Big Bang Theory,23,5
17455,Howard,10," A jar with a big spider in it, of course. Bravery test. First one to take his hand out is the sidekick.",4,Big Bang Theory,104,22
17456,Raj,10, Are you crazy?,4,Big Bang Theory,15,3
17457,Howard,10, Perhaps. Are you scared?,4,Big Bang Theory,25,4
17458,Raj,10, No. But it's a stupid test.,4,Big Bang Theory,28,6
17459,Howard,10," Oh, really? What if the earth was in danger and the only way to save it was to stick your hand in a jar with a spider?",4,Big Bang Theory,119,27
17460,Raj,10," Oh, yeah? What if the earth was in danger and the only way to save it was to take a shower in the locker room and let other guys see you naked?",4,Big Bang Theory,144,32
17461,Howard,10," Oh, come on. That's never gonna happen. Now put your hand in the jar or forever be revealed as my sidekick.",4,Big Bang Theory,108,21
17462,Raj,10," All right, I will.",4,Big Bang Theory,19,4
17463,Howard,10, How did you get so brave all of a sudden?,4,Big Bang Theory,42,10
17464,Raj,10, It's easy. The spider's crawling up your arm.,4,Big Bang Theory,46,8
17465,Howard,10," Get it off! Get it off! Please, Raj! Ah! Ah! Ah! Please. Oh!",4,Big Bang Theory,61,13
17467,Amy,10, My blood work shows thyroid function normal. Cortisol levels normal.,4,Big Bang Theory,69,10
17468,Sheldon,10, How about your follicle-stimulating hormone levels?,4,Big Bang Theory,52,6
17469,Amy,10," Sheldon, I am not going through menopause.",4,Big Bang Theory,43,7
17470,Sheldon,10, Are you sure? You said that with the testy bark of an old biddy.,4,Big Bang Theory,65,14
17471,Amy,10," I think we need to face the cold, hard truth, I was sexually aroused by Penny's friend Zack.",4,Big Bang Theory,93,18
17472,Sheldon,10, Hang on. I don't know that we've given the alien parasite hypothesis a fair shake.,4,Big Bang Theory,83,15
17473,Amy,10," Let's look at this logically. I have a stomach, I get hungry. I have genitals, I have the potential for sexual arousal.",4,Big Bang Theory,120,22
17474,Sheldon,10," A cross we all must bear. You know, in difficult moments like this, I often turn to a force greater than myself.",4,Big Bang Theory,113,22
17475,Amy,10, Religion?,4,Big Bang Theory,10,1
17476,Amy,10, No.,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
17477,Sheldon,10," Don't. It's terrible. However, in it, we learn that when Spock finds himself drawn off the path of logic by feelings bubbling up from his human half, he suppresses them using the Vulcan mental discipline of Kolinar.",4,Big Bang Theory,216,37
17478,Amy,10, Are you suggesting we live our lives guided by the philosophies found in cheap science fiction?,4,Big Bang Theory,96,16
17479,Sheldon,10, Cheap science fiction?,4,Big Bang Theory,23,3
17480,Amy,10, What are you doing?,4,Big Bang Theory,20,4
17481,Sheldon,10, Using Kolinar to suppress my anger at that last comment.,4,Big Bang Theory,57,10
17482,Amy,10, Is it possible that your concern for me at this moment is motivated by nothing more than simple jealousy?,4,Big Bang Theory,106,19
17483,Sheldon,10," I hadn't considered that. Give me a moment. All right, I've considered it.",4,Big Bang Theory,75,13
17484,Amy,10, And?,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
17485,Sheldon,10, I reject it.,4,Big Bang Theory,13,3
17486,Amy,10," You reject it because you don't feel jealousy, or because you are suppressing jealousy?",4,Big Bang Theory,88,14
17487,Sheldon,10, I think I'll eat my lunch at home.,4,Big Bang Theory,35,8
17488,Amy,10," That's not your lunch, Sheldon, those are the cadaver brain specimens.",4,Big Bang Theory,71,11
17489,Sheldon,10," Oh. As they were incorrectly sliced, you can see how I could mistake them for my sashimi.",4,Big Bang Theory,90,17
17491,Sheldon,10, Hello.,4,Big Bang Theory,7,1
17492,Penny,10, Hey. Isn't tomorrow your usual laundry night?,4,Big Bang Theory,46,7
17493,Sheldon,10," The supermarket was out of my regular fabric softener. If this one under or over-softens, I'll need time to make things right.",4,Big Bang Theory,127,22
17494,Penny,10, That's thinking ahead.,4,Big Bang Theory,23,3
17495,Sheldon,10, The alternative would be to think backwards. And that's just remembering.,4,Big Bang Theory,74,11
17496,Penny,10, So how's Amy?,4,Big Bang Theory,14,3
17497,Sheldon,10, Amy's changed. I might have to let her go.,4,Big Bang Theory,43,9
17498,Penny,10," Oh, no. Why?",4,Big Bang Theory,13,3
17499,Sheldon,10," I thought she was a highly evolved creature of pure intellect, like me. But recent events indicate that she may be a slave to her baser urges. Like you.",4,Big Bang Theory,153,29
17500,Penny,10, Just going to skip over that insult.,4,Big Bang Theory,37,7
17501,Sheldon,10, What insult?,4,Big Bang Theory,13,2
17502,Penny,10," Yeah. That's why I'm going to skip over it. Are you saying that Amy is, oh, what's the",4,Big Bang Theory,87,18
17503,Sheldon,10, Forget science. She's horny.,4,Big Bang Theory,29,4
17504,Penny,10, Oh! Okay. Wow.,4,Big Bang Theory,15,3
17505,Sheldon,10, It's simple biology. There's nothing I can do about it.,4,Big Bang Theory,56,10
17506,Penny,10, Are you sure?,4,Big Bang Theory,14,3
17507,Sheldon,10, What are you suggesting?,4,Big Bang Theory,25,4
17508,Penny,10, I'm suggesting there might be something you could do about Amy's urges?,4,Big Bang Theory,72,12
17509,Sheldon,10, It's illegal to spay a human being.,4,Big Bang Theory,36,7
17510,Penny,10, Yeah. That's not what I had in mind.,4,Big Bang Theory,37,8
17511,Sheldon,10, Oh. Oh! You mean something I could do.,4,Big Bang Theory,39,8
17512,Penny,10, Exactly.,4,Big Bang Theory,9,1
17513,Sheldon,10," Well, I was hoping to avoid this. But I might as well get it over with. Thank you, Penny. I'll let you know what happens.",4,Big Bang Theory,122,25
17514,Penny,10," Oh, Amy, you lucky girl.",4,Big Bang Theory,25,5
17516,Sheldon,10," Yes. This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Is this the Zack Johnson who used to have coitus with my neighbour Penny? Sorry to bother you. Hello. I'm looking for a Zack Johnson who used to have coitus with my neighbour Penny. Coitus. It means intercourse. And I have a feeling I'm speaking to the right Zack. This is Sheldon Cooper. Fine. Shelly. Yes, that does sound like a girl's name. No, it doesn't bother me. Yes, Smelly Shelly does bother me. Let me tell you why I'm calling. I'd like to know if you'd be interested in having sex with Amy Farrah Fowler. Amy Farrah Fowler. Yes, that is a girl's name. Good grief. It's like trying to talk to a dolphin.",4,Big Bang Theory,647,121
17518,Leonard,10, Really? This is going to decide who's the hero and who's the sidekick?,4,Big Bang Theory,71,13
17519,Howard,10, You got a better idea?,4,Big Bang Theory,23,5
17520,Leonard,10, Every idea is better than this idea.,4,Big Bang Theory,37,7
17521,Howard,10, Ding!,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
17522,Raj,10, Wait. What the hell is ding?,4,Big Bang Theory,29,6
17523,Howard,10, It's a bell.,4,Big Bang Theory,13,3
17524,Raj,10, I don't think this kind of wrestling has a bell.,4,Big Bang Theory,49,10
17525,Howard,10, Fine. How do you want to start?,4,Big Bang Theory,32,7
17526,Raj,10," I say, uh, how about one, two, three, go?",4,Big Bang Theory,42,9
17527,Howard,10, One-two-three-go? That's for babies.,4,Big Bang Theory,37,4
17528,Raj,10," Okay, how about, uh, on your mark, get set, go?",4,Big Bang Theory,48,10
17529,Howard,10," That's for a footrace. If you want to race, we have to go outside.",4,Big Bang Theory,67,14
17530,Raj,10," No, it's chilly outside. Didn't bring my jacket.",4,Big Bang Theory,49,8
17531,Howard,10," Oh, for crying out loud. What kind of superhero needs a jacket?",4,Big Bang Theory,64,12
17532,Raj,10," What kind of superhero says dibs on the red tights, dibs on the red tights.",4,Big Bang Theory,76,15
17533,Howard,10," All right, how about this? Ready, wrestle.",4,Big Bang Theory,43,7
17534,Raj,10," Wait. Are we starting now? Or is that what you're going to say when we do start, or",4,Big Bang Theory,84,18
17535,Howard,10, We're starting now!,4,Big Bang Theory,20,3
17536,Raj,10, Don't yell at me!,4,Big Bang Theory,18,4
17537,Leonard,10, Suppose there are worse ways to spend a Friday night. None come to mind.,4,Big Bang Theory,73,14
17539,Sheldon,10, Look at this stamp. On what authority are they permitted to mutilate patrons as they enter?,4,Big Bang Theory,92,16
17540,Amy,10, I'm sure it'll wash off.,4,Big Bang Theory,25,5
17541,Sheldon,10, Little comfort tonight. I look like a Hell's Angel.,4,Big Bang Theory,52,9
17542,Amy,10, There's Zack.,4,Big Bang Theory,14,2
17543,Sheldon,10, Are you sure this is what you want to do?,4,Big Bang Theory,42,10
17544,Amy,10," It's not what I want to do, it's what I have to do.",4,Big Bang Theory,52,13
17545,Sheldon,10," Go, Amy Farrah Fowler. Follow your endocrine system.",4,Big Bang Theory,53,8
17546,Amy,10," Thank you, Sheldon. You're a good friend.",4,Big Bang Theory,42,7
17547,Sheldon,10, Please don't drag this out. This is never going to come off.,4,Big Bang Theory,61,12
17548,Amy,10," Excuse me? Zack? I am Amy Farrah Fowler. We met the other night. I have spent my life in pursuit of pure knowledge. Until I met you, my decisions were founded in logic and reason. And yet here I stand before you, 130 pounds of raging estrogen, longing to grab hold of your gluteus maximus and make Shakespeare's metaphorical beast with two backs.",4,Big Bang Theory,347,63
17550,Amy,10," On the other hand, as I look at the blank, ape-like expression on your face, I have decided to adopt the Vulcan practice of Kolinar. Good-bye, Zack.",4,Big Bang Theory,149,27
17553,Howard,10, I'm legally obligated to inform you that I took a karate lesson when I was 11. I'd be a regular ninja by now if my mom could've arranged a carpool.,4,Big Bang Theory,148,30
17554,Raj,10," Oh, yeah? Well, I've been taking Pilates class at the rec center, and my abs look like sections of a Hershey bar.",4,Big Bang Theory,114,22
17555,Howard,10," Oh, yeah? Won't matter, you're going down!",4,Big Bang Theory,43,7
17556,Raj,10," No, uh-uh, you're going down!",4,Big Bang Theory,30,5
17557,Howard,10," If anybody's going to go down, it's going to be you.",4,Big Bang Theory,53,11
17558,Leonard,10, Fellas. It's been 30 minutes. Nobody's touched each other.,4,Big Bang Theory,59,9
17560,Sheldon,10, I'm glad you decided to reject your animal hindbrain and return to the realm of pure intellect.,4,Big Bang Theory,96,17
17561,Amy,10, As am I. ,4,Big Bang Theory,10,3
17562,Sheldon,10, What are you doing?,4,Big Bang Theory,20,4
17563,Amy,10, An experiment. Nope. Nothing. Never mind.,4,Big Bang Theory,42,6
17565,Raj,10, You realize you can't win.,4,Big Bang Theory,27,5
17566,Howard,10, I prefer to think that I can't lose.,4,Big Bang Theory,37,8
17567,Raj,10, You're wrong. It's only a matter of time before you fall into Rat-Man's rat trap.,4,Big Bang Theory,82,15
17568,Howard,10," You pathetic fool! If there were a rat-catcher, wouldn't it catch Rat-Man?",4,Big Bang Theory,75,12
17569,Raj,10, Just because I didn't express myself well doesn't mean my underlying point was invalid! You bloviating buffoon!,4,Big Bang Theory,112,17
17570,Howard,10, You narcissistic nincompoop!,4,Big Bang Theory,29,3
17571,Raj,10," You crimson coward! Oh, Leonard, wake up, you're missing some very excellent superhero quips.",4,Big Bang Theory,94,14
17573,Raj,11, Water Demon.,4,Big Bang Theory,13,2
17574,Howard,11, Ice Dragon.,4,Big Bang Theory,12,2
17575,Leonard,11, Lesser Warlord of Ka'a.,4,Big Bang Theory,24,4
17576,Sheldon,11, Not so fast. Infinite Sheldon.,4,Big Bang Theory,31,5
17577,Leonard,11, Infinite Sheldon?,4,Big Bang Theory,18,2
17578,Sheldon,11," Yes, Infinite Sheldon defeats all other cards and does not violate the rule against homemade cards because I made it at work.",4,Big Bang Theory,126,22
17579,Leonard,11, Do you understand why people don't want to play with you?,4,Big Bang Theory,58,11
17580,Sheldon,11," No, although it's a question I've been pondering since preschool.",4,Big Bang Theory,66,10
17581,Leonard,11, Hey.,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
17583,Leonard,11, Hey.,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
17584,Penny,11," Hey, your copy of Science magazine was in my mailbox.",4,Big Bang Theory,54,10
17585,Leonard,11," Oh, thanks.",4,Big Bang Theory,12,2
17586,Penny,11, Mm-hmm.,4,Big Bang Theory,8,1
17588,Leonard,11, That's an atom.,4,Big Bang Theory,16,3
17590,Leonard,11," So, you and Zack again, huh?",4,Big Bang Theory,29,6
17591,Penny,11," Yeah, yeah, me and Zack again.",4,Big Bang Theory,31,6
17593,Penny,11," Okay, we should, we should go.",4,Big Bang Theory,31,6
17595,Howard,11," Oh, and the science dudes want to talk science with you. What do you want to talk about, rocks, dinosaurs, our friend the beaver?",4,Big Bang Theory,130,24
17597,Sheldon,11, Was the starfish wearing boxer shorts? Because you might have been watching Nickelodeon.,4,Big Bang Theory,89,13
17599,Leonard,11, They might be smarter than some people.,4,Big Bang Theory,40,7
17601,Sheldon,11," Oh, that's easy enough. We'd need a large tank of water, a hoop to jump through, and a bucket of whatever bite-sized treats you find tasty.",4,Big Bang Theory,140,26
17603,Leonard,11, A dolphin might.,4,Big Bang Theory,17,3
17605,Sheldon,11, That's not correct. We were implying it. You then inferred it.,4,Big Bang Theory,63,11
17607,Penny,11," You know, for a group of guys who claim they spent most of their lives being bullied, you can be real jerks. Shame on all of you. ",4,Big Bang Theory,131,27
17608,Raj,11, What the hell did I do?,4,Big Bang Theory,24,6
17609,Penny,11, You laughed.,4,Big Bang Theory,13,2
17611,Leonard,11, You think Penny's right? Were we bullying Zack?,4,Big Bang Theory,48,8
17612,Howard,11," No, I know bullying. He left here unswirlied and his ass crack was underpants-free.",4,Big Bang Theory,84,14
17613,Raj,11, And nobody drew a penis on his forehead.,4,Big Bang Theory,41,8
17614,Leonard,11, That happened to you?,4,Big Bang Theory,22,4
17615,Raj,11, First day of cricket camp. They drew it so the testicles were my eyes.,4,Big Bang Theory,71,14
17616,Leonard,11," I don't know, I think we might owe the guy an apology.",4,Big Bang Theory,55,12
17617,Howard,11, So go apologize.,4,Big Bang Theory,17,3
17618,Leonard,11, Why me?,4,Big Bang Theory,8,2
17619,Howard,11," You started it, we just piled on.",4,Big Bang Theory,34,7
17620,Leonard,11, What would I even say?,4,Big Bang Theory,23,5
17621,Sheldon,11," Zack, I'm sorry you're stupid. Have a Milk Dud.",4,Big Bang Theory,48,9
17622,Raj,11, A Milk Dud?,4,Big Bang Theory,12,3
17623,Sheldon,11," Yeah, Milk Duds, with their self-deprecating name and remarkably mild flavour, are the most apologetic of the boxed candies.",4,Big Bang Theory,125,19
17624,Leonard,11," I got a better idea. We're all responsible. I say we all go. Come on, who's with me? Free comic books to anyone who comes with me. I might get punched. You really want to miss that?",4,Big Bang Theory,182,37
17625,Raj,11, Junior Mints are pretty apologetic.,4,Big Bang Theory,36,5
17626,Sheldon,11, You're embarrassing yourself.,4,Big Bang Theory,30,3
17628,Sheldon,11, Penny.,4,Big Bang Theory,7,1
17629,Penny,11, What?,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
17630,Leonard,11," Yeah, we came to talk to Zack. Hey, Zack.",4,Big Bang Theory,42,9
17632,Leonard,11," Listen, uh, the stuff we were saying before, we were just kidding around.",4,Big Bang Theory,74,13
17634,Leonard,11," Come on, that's what we do. We give each other a hard time. Hey, Sheldon, you look like a praying mantis.",4,Big Bang Theory,106,21
17635,Sheldon,11, That's very hurtful.,4,Big Bang Theory,21,3
17636,Leonard,11, See?,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
17638,Sheldon,11, Milk Dud?,4,Big Bang Theory,10,2
17640,Sheldon,11, Junior Mints.,4,Big Bang Theory,14,2
17642,Leonard,11," Uh, we're on our way to the comic book store.",4,Big Bang Theory,46,10
17643,Howard,11, Leonard's buying.,4,Big Bang Theory,18,2
17645,Sheldon,11, Literally? Literally a million years?,4,Big Bang Theory,38,5
17646,Leonard,11, Don't.,4,Big Bang Theory,7,1
17648,Penny,11, No.,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
17650,Penny,11," Wait, w-w-wait-wait-wait, you're ditching me to go look at comic books?",4,Big Bang Theory,72,11
17652,Penny,11, I'm not happy.,4,Big Bang Theory,15,3
17656,Sheldon,11," In the bedrooms of ten-year-old girls, where they belong.",4,Big Bang Theory,58,9
17658,Raj,11, No.,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
17663,Leonard,11," Uh, no. Oh, this is Zack. He's a friend of ours. Zack, this is Stuart. He owns the store.",4,Big Bang Theory,90,19
17668,Howard,11," Uh, no, it's an indictment of the American education system.",4,Big Bang Theory,61,10
17669,Raj,11, The Archies are over here.,4,Big Bang Theory,27,5
17672,Sheldon,11, Of course. We're coming as the Justice League of America.,4,Big Bang Theory,58,10
17673,Howard,11, Switching it up from last year when we came as the Justice League of America.,4,Big Bang Theory,78,15
17674,Sheldon,11," To that point, it occurs to me that we might have an opportunity to finally snare Best Group Costume if we shore up our weak link, which is clearly Leonard as Superman.",4,Big Bang Theory,169,32
17675,Leonard,11," Hey, I got new boots this year. Guaranteed to add three inches.",4,Big Bang Theory,64,12
17676,Sheldon,11," That's sad. Let's ask ourselves, is there anyone we know who would make a more manly and convincing son of Krypton?",4,Big Bang Theory,116,21
17678,Sheldon,11, I was thinking specifically of the gentleman over there moving his lips as he enjoys the latest exploits of Betty and Veronica.,4,Big Bang Theory,128,22
17679,Leonard,11, Zack?,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
17680,Howard,11, He is the only person we know with actual muscles.,4,Big Bang Theory,51,10
17681,Leonard,11, You can't replace me with Zack.,4,Big Bang Theory,32,6
17682,Sheldon,11, Why not? Penny did it.,4,Big Bang Theory,23,5
17683,Howard,11," Yeah, she seems happier. Why wouldn't we be?",4,Big Bang Theory,45,8
17685,Sheldon,11," Congratulations. Zack, how would you like to be Superman?",4,Big Bang Theory,58,9
17688,Leonard,11," Fine, if Zack's going to be Superman, I want to be Green Lantern.",4,Big Bang Theory,66,13
17689,Raj,11, But I'm Green Lantern.,4,Big Bang Theory,23,4
17690,Leonard,11, You can be Aquaman.,4,Big Bang Theory,20,4
17691,Raj,11, I don't want to be Aquaman. He sucks. He sucks underwater. He sucks fish pee.,4,Big Bang Theory,78,15
17692,Sheldon,11," Excuse me, I believe Aquaman uses his telepathic powers to request the fish do their business elsewhere.",4,Big Bang Theory,105,17
17694,Penny,11, I'm still mad at you.,4,Big Bang Theory,22,5
17696,Penny,11, What great news?,4,Big Bang Theory,17,3
17698,Sheldon,11, Complete with bulletproof bracelets and lasso of truth. Invisible plane sold separately.,4,Big Bang Theory,89,12
17699,Penny,11," Wait, why me? Wh-Why can't your girlfriend be Wonder Woman?",4,Big Bang Theory,60,10
17700,Howard,11, She and her lab team are under quarantine. Seems at the Christmas party they were doing Jell-O shots out of petri dishes that used to contain yellow fever.,4,Big Bang Theory,156,28
17701,Penny,11," Okay, what about your friend Amy?",4,Big Bang Theory,34,6
17702,Sheldon,11, Amy Farrah Fowler doesn't believe in wearing costumes. She isn't the free spirit I am.,4,Big Bang Theory,87,15
17703,Penny,11," Okay, well, forget it. I'm not spending my New Year's Eve at a comic book store wearing a Wonder Woman costume.",4,Big Bang Theory,112,21
17704,Howard,11, He says he'll wear it if you'll be Aquaman.,4,Big Bang Theory,44,9
17706,Leonard,11, What are you doing?,4,Big Bang Theory,20,4
17707,Sheldon,11, We're going to be late. I'm pacing nervously.,4,Big Bang Theory,46,8
17708,Leonard,11, You're jogging.,4,Big Bang Theory,16,2
17709,Sheldon,11, This is how the Flash paces.,4,Big Bang Theory,29,6
17710,Sheldon,11, I'm not Sheldon. I'm the Flash. And now I'm going to the Grand Canyon to scream in frustration. I'm back.,4,Big Bang Theory,106,20
17711,Howard,11, I'm Batman.,4,Big Bang Theory,12,2
17712,Sheldon,11," Oh, I hardly think so. The real caped crusader calls his crime-fighting cohorts when he's running late.",4,Big Bang Theory,104,17
17713,Howard,11, I had to walk. I couldn't get Raj on the back of my scooter.,4,Big Bang Theory,61,14
17714,Raj,11," I've said this before, and I'll say it again. Aquaman sucks.",4,Big Bang Theory,61,11
17716,Penny,11, All right. Let's get this thing over with.,4,Big Bang Theory,43,8
17717,Sheldon,11, I'm sorry. But in what universe is Wonder Woman blonde?,4,Big Bang Theory,56,10
17718,Howard,11," Relax. No one's going to be looking at her hair. Ow! I mean, ow.",4,Big Bang Theory,65,14
17720,Penny,11, No. I'm not wearing it. It looks stupid.,4,Big Bang Theory,41,8
17722,Penny,11, Forget it. I'm not wearing the wig.,4,Big Bang Theory,36,7
17724,Howard,11," Well, actually.",4,Big Bang Theory,16,2
17725,Sheldon,11, Don't. He's making our case.,4,Big Bang Theory,29,5
17727,Penny,11, Okay. You know what? I changed my mind. I'm not going.,4,Big Bang Theory,55,11
17728,Raj,11, Looks like someone else is going to have to be Wonder Woman.,4,Big Bang Theory,61,12
17731,Penny,11, I'm not talking to you.,4,Big Bang Theory,24,5
17733,Sheldon,11,"  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny,  Penny.",4,Big Bang Theory,160,20
17734,Penny,11, What the hell is wrong with you?,4,Big Bang Theory,33,7
17735,Sheldon,11," I'm the Flash. I just knocked 30,000 times.",4,Big Bang Theory,44,8
17736,Penny,11," Okay. What do you want, Sheldon?",4,Big Bang Theory,33,6
17737,Sheldon,11, I understand why you're upset.,4,Big Bang Theory,31,5
17738,Penny,11, Really?,4,Big Bang Theory,8,1
17739,Sheldon,11, Yes. You're afraid that costume makes you look fat.,4,Big Bang Theory,52,9
17740,Penny,11," No. Wait, wait, does it?",4,Big Bang Theory,25,5
17741,Sheldon,11, Don't worry. Wonder Woman was an Amazon. And Amazons tend to be very beefy gals.,4,Big Bang Theory,81,15
17742,Penny,11," Good-bye, Sheldon.",4,Big Bang Theory,19,2
17743,Sheldon,11," But they're not blonde, so put on your wig. Hello?",4,Big Bang Theory,51,10
17745,Raj,11, Stupid Aquaman.,4,Big Bang Theory,16,2
17746,Leonard,11," If it makes you feel any better, when I was dating Penny, she used to flip out on me all the time.",4,Big Bang Theory,99,22
17748,Leonard,11, She didn't tell you?,4,Big Bang Theory,21,4
17750,Leonard,11, Who else would it be?,4,Big Bang Theory,22,5
17752,Sheldon,11, I may have failed.,4,Big Bang Theory,19,4
17753,Howard,11," Okay, I guess we just go without a Wonder Woman.",4,Big Bang Theory,49,10
17755,Raj,11," Oh, great. No Superman, no Wonder Woman? All we've got is a skinny Flash, an Indian Aquaman, a nearsighted Green Lantern, and a teeny, tiny Dark Knight.",4,Big Bang Theory,153,27
17756,Sheldon,11," Obviously, we're no longer a Justice League. We have no choice but to switch to our Muppet Baby costumes.",4,Big Bang Theory,106,19
17757,Raj,11," Ooh, I call Kermit.",4,Big Bang Theory,20,4
17758,Sheldon,11, I'm Kermit. You're Scooter.,4,Big Bang Theory,28,4
17759,Raj,11," Oh, man. Scooter sucks. He's the Aquaman of the Muppet Babies.",4,Big Bang Theory,63,11
17760,Howard,11," No, we can still make this work. Leonard, you talk to Penny.",4,Big Bang Theory,61,12
17761,Leonard,11, What makes you think I can convince her?,4,Big Bang Theory,41,8
17762,Howard,11," You got her to have sex with you. Obviously, your superpower is brainwashing.",4,Big Bang Theory,78,13
17763,Leonard,11," Okay, let me see if I understand this. You want me to convince my ex-girlfriend to go to a costume party with her new boyfriend just so we can win a stupid prize?",4,Big Bang Theory,163,33
17764,Sheldon,11, Yes. And make her wear the black wig. Good luck.,4,Big Bang Theory,49,10
17766,Penny,11," Go away, Sheldon.",4,Big Bang Theory,18,3
17767,Leonard,11, It's Leonard.,4,Big Bang Theory,14,2
17768,Penny,11," Oh. Go away, Leonard.",4,Big Bang Theory,22,4
17769,Penny,11, It's open.,4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
17770,Leonard,11, Hey.,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
17771,Penny,11," I'm not going to that party, Leonard.",4,Big Bang Theory,38,7
17772,Leonard,11," Okay, listen. You don't have to wear the wig. At this party, we're gonna win first prize just by showing up with a girl.",4,Big Bang Theory,121,24
17773,Penny,11, It's not the wig.,4,Big Bang Theory,18,4
17774,Leonard,11," Did I do something? I mean, I tried to be friends with Zack, like you said, which believe me, was difficult, given how you and me used to be, you know, you and me, and now you and him are you and him.",4,Big Bang Theory,201,43
17775,Penny,11," Okay, look. We're not really me and him.",4,Big Bang Theory,41,8
17776,Leonard,11, Then what are you?,4,Big Bang Theory,19,4
17777,Penny,11, I don't know. I only started seeing Zack again so I wouldn't be alone on New Year's Eve. How pathetic is that?,4,Big Bang Theory,111,22
17778,Leonard,11, Not as pathetic as dressing up like this and going to a comic book store on New Year's Eve.,4,Big Bang Theory,92,19
17779,Penny,11, You make a cute Green Arrow.,4,Big Bang Theory,29,6
17780,Leonard,11, Green Lantern.,4,Big Bang Theory,15,2
17781,Penny,11, Like there's a difference.,4,Big Bang Theory,27,4
17782,Leonard,11, There's a big difference. Arrow. Lantern.,4,Big Bang Theory,42,6
17783,Penny,11," Whatever. Look, if Zack and I had just gone to a regular club or a party, it would have been fine, but this, with the costumes, and you.",4,Big Bang Theory,137,28
17784,Leonard,11, What about me?,4,Big Bang Theory,15,3
17785,Penny,11, Nothing. Let's go to the party.  How do I look?,4,Big Bang Theory,48,10
17786,Leonard,11," Um, I guarantee you'll be the prettiest girl there.",4,Big Bang Theory,52,9
17787,Howard,11," Okay, the good news is, we have a Wonder Woman.",4,Big Bang Theory,48,10
17788,Sheldon,11, Oh.,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
17790,Sheldon,11, What's the bad news?,4,Big Bang Theory,21,4
17791,Howard,11, Superman probably isn't getting laid tonight.,4,Big Bang Theory,46,6
17795,Sheldon,11, Thank you! Thank you so much!,4,Big Bang Theory,30,6
17798,Sheldon,11," No, wait! I have a speech.",4,Big Bang Theory,27,6
17800,Sheldon,11, Stop counting!,4,Big Bang Theory,15,2
17802,Sheldon,11," This is my moment, dag nab it!",4,Big Bang Theory,31,7
17804,Sheldon,11, I'm not going to say another word until you people settle down. I'm waiting.,4,Big Bang Theory,77,14
17807,Penny,11, Are you high?,4,Big Bang Theory,14,3
17808,Leonard,11, You're being a bully.,4,Big Bang Theory,22,4
17809,Howard,11, Check it out. Those guys are breaking into that car.,4,Big Bang Theory,53,10
17810,Leonard,11, What should we do?,4,Big Bang Theory,19,4
17811,Sheldon,11, We're the Justice League of America. There's only one thing we can do. Turn around and slowly walk away.,4,Big Bang Theory,105,19
17814,Leonard,11," Look, I know our winter thermostat setting is 72 degrees, but I'm a little warm, so I'm going to turn it down.",4,Big Bang Theory,111,22
17815,Sheldon,11," Good Lord, how you frustrate me, Leonard Hofstadter!  Fine.",4,Big Bang Theory,60,9
17817,Howard,12," Ma, Ma, calm down. Listen to me. I know it says click with the mouse, but on a laptop, the trackpad is the mouse. Now, put your finger on it. Doesn't matter which finger. Good choice. Now move it down to your e-mail icon. Yeah, the little envelope. What do you mean, what does it look like? It looks like an envelope! Fine, you don't like the computer, don't use it! Sure, we can exchange it for a salad spinner. Good-bye!",4,Big Bang Theory,423,81
17818,Raj,12," That's a Hanukkah present you're regretting, huh?",4,Big Bang Theory,50,7
17819,Sheldon,12," I won't say that all senior citizens who can't master technology should be publicly flogged, but if we made an example of one or two, it might give the others incentive to try harder.",4,Big Bang Theory,184,34
17820,Leonard,12," I had a great idea. You know how we're always having to stop and solve differential equations, like when you're doing Fourier analysis, or using the Schrodinger equation?",4,Big Bang Theory,171,28
17821,Sheldon,12, Howard doesn't. He's only an engineer.,4,Big Bang Theory,39,6
17822,Leonard,12," I was thinking, we could write a little app that would use handwriting recognition, and then run it through a symbolic evaluation engine. You just use your smartphone, take a picture of the equation and bam!",4,Big Bang Theory,208,36
17823,Raj,12, You know what's a great app? The one that makes fart noises.,4,Big Bang Theory,61,12
17824,Sheldon,12," You know, Leonard, that's actually a valid idea. Very good.",4,Big Bang Theory,60,10
17825,Leonard,12, Can you say that and not make it sound like I'm a cat who learned how to use the toilet?,4,Big Bang Theory,89,20
17826,Sheldon,12," No. The two achievements are equally surprising and equally admirable, though if pressed, I'd have to give a slight edge to the cat. I'll save you the pain and nervousness of waiting for the answer. I agree to be part of your project. Congratulations.",4,Big Bang Theory,252,44
17827,Leonard,12," Oh, yay for me. What about you guys? I can't promise anything, but people do make money off stuff like this.",4,Big Bang Theory,109,21
17828,Howard,12, A few extra bucks would be nice. I could finally move out of my mother's house.,4,Big Bang Theory,80,16
17829,Raj,12, Where would you go?,4,Big Bang Theory,20,4
17830,Howard,12, I always dreamed about building a little place of my own over the garage.,4,Big Bang Theory,74,14
17831,Raj,12," You know, if I made more money, I could take time off from work and give pretty girls submarine rides.",4,Big Bang Theory,103,20
17832,Howard,12, What's that? Some weird sex thing?,4,Big Bang Theory,35,6
17833,Raj,12," No. You take pretty girls underwater in your private submarine, and you show them fish. Why does everything have to be dirty with you?",4,Big Bang Theory,135,24
17834,Leonard,12," I was thinking we could work on this at night, and then maybe in a couple of weeks, we'll have ourselves an app to sell.",4,Big Bang Theory,121,25
17835,Howard,12, Sounds like we're in business.,4,Big Bang Theory,31,5
17836,Raj,12, I think we should take a picture to capture this moment.,4,Big Bang Theory,57,11
17837,Leonard,12, Yeah.,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
17838,Sheldon,12, Oh!,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
17839,Raj,12," Was that the best 99 cents I ever spent, or what?",4,Big Bang Theory,50,11
17841,Leonard,12, I checked the App Store. No one is doing handwriting-recognition differential equation solving.,4,Big Bang Theory,96,13
17842,Sheldon,12," Oh, dear Lord, shush.",4,Big Bang Theory,22,4
17843,Leonard,12, What?,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
17844,Sheldon,12," You have so few good ideas, Leonard. And you're just going to spill the beans in front of an outsider?",4,Big Bang Theory,103,20
17845,Penny,12," Who, me?",4,Big Bang Theory,9,2
17846,Howard,12," Sheldon, I don't think Penny cares about handwriting-recognition based differential",4,Big Bang Theory,84,10
17847,Sheldon,12," The stars at night are big and bright, deep in the heart of Texas.",4,Big Bang Theory,67,14
17848,Leonard,12, She's not going to steal our idea.,4,Big Bang Theory,35,7
17849,Penny,12, What idea?,4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
17850,Leonard,12, We're gonna write an application,4,Big Bang Theory,33,5
17851,Sheldon,12," The prairie sky is wide and high, deep in the heart",4,Big Bang Theory,52,11
17852,Penny,12," Okay, stop, stop!",4,Big Bang Theory,18,3
17853,Sheldon,12, Of Texas.,4,Big Bang Theory,10,2
17854,Penny,12," Whatever your secret is, I'm sure it's boring, so I'm not interested.",4,Big Bang Theory,70,12
17855,Leonard,12," It's not boring at all. You see, in higher order mathematics, there are certain sets of equations that",4,Big Bang Theory,103,18
17856,Penny,12, Bored.,4,Big Bang Theory,7,1
17857,Leonard,12, Satisfied?,4,Big Bang Theory,11,1
17858,Sheldon,12, Hardly. Consider this unlikely but very plausible scenario. A young woman alone in the big city. Her ridiculous dream of becoming an actress lies shattered about her.,4,Big Bang Theory,167,27
17859,Penny,12," Hey, wait a minute.",4,Big Bang Theory,20,4
17860,Howard,12," Well, hang on. Let's see where he's going.",4,Big Bang Theory,43,8
17861,Sheldon,12," Then it hits her. How is she going to survive? I mean, she has no prospects, no marketable skills. And then one day, she meets a group of geniuses and their friend Howard.",4,Big Bang Theory,172,33
17862,Howard,12," Hey, I",4,Big Bang Theory,7,2
17863,Penny,12, Hang on. Let's see where he's going.,4,Big Bang Theory,37,7
17864,Sheldon,12," She befriends them, and then lies in wait until they reveal a marketable idea, which she steals and sells to the highest bidder.",4,Big Bang Theory,129,23
17865,Leonard,12, That is ridiculous.,4,Big Bang Theory,20,3
17866,Sheldon,12," Oh, is it? Well let's see you come up with an explanation as to why this woman hangs out with us all the time.",4,Big Bang Theory,111,24
17867,Penny,12," Oh, great. You know what? I've already mooched dinner off you guys. I don't need to listen to this.",4,Big Bang Theory,100,19
17868,Howard,12," There's your answer, free food.",4,Big Bang Theory,32,5
17869,Sheldon,12," All right, I've taken the liberty of drafting these workflow charts which outline our various duties and the path we will follow as we develop our ground-breaking new app.",4,Big Bang Theory,172,29
17870,Raj,12," Hey, why am I in charge of phone support? Seems a bit racist.",4,Big Bang Theory,62,13
17871,Sheldon,12, A customer service representative with an Indian accent will create the impression we're a vast enterprise that uses overseas call centres.,4,Big Bang Theory,140,21
17872,Raj,12, Oh. Very clever. But still racist.,4,Big Bang Theory,35,6
17873,Sheldon,12," Duly noted, Steve from Wichita.",4,Big Bang Theory,32,5
17874,Howard,12, Why am I listed as your executive assistant?,4,Big Bang Theory,45,8
17875,Sheldon,12," Because the word secretary has fallen into disrepute. FYI, my mother's birthday is coming up. I'm going to need you to pick up a present.",4,Big Bang Theory,138,25
17876,Leonard,12," Okay, we need to stop for a minute.",4,Big Bang Theory,36,8
17877,Sheldon,12," Leonard, please, we can talk during our break. We have one coming up at midnight. We'll need snacks.",4,Big Bang Theory,101,18
17878,Leonard,12," Sheldon, you're not in charge. It's my idea. I'm in charge.",4,Big Bang Theory,60,11
17879,Sheldon,12," Oh, of course you are. Look at the organizational chart. You're clearly listed as founder.",4,Big Bang Theory,91,15
17880,Leonard,12," Well, yes, and you're listed as Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer.",4,Big Bang Theory,110,16
17881,Sheldon,12," You missed Chief Science Officer, Chairman of the Board, and Head of the Secret Santa Committee.",4,Big Bang Theory,97,16
17882,Leonard,12, Okay. You need to get clear on this right now. I am in charge of this project.,4,Big Bang Theory,79,17
17883,Raj,12, Ooh. Leonard's going all alpha nerd on Sheldon's ass.,4,Big Bang Theory,54,9
17884,Sheldon,12," All right. All right, I'm not going to argue with you. Sheldon Cooper is nothing if not a team player. Dr. Hofstadter, you have the conn.",4,Big Bang Theory,138,26
17885,Leonard,12, Thank you. I thought we might start by talking about the user interface.,4,Big Bang Theory,73,13
17886,Sheldon,12," Oh, dear Lord, we're doomed.",4,Big Bang Theory,29,5
17888,Leonard,12," So this button here will allow you to scan a new equation, but over here, you can press this, and just substitute new values for the coefficients.",4,Big Bang Theory,147,27
17889,Sheldon,12," Good one, boss.",4,Big Bang Theory,16,3
17890,Leonard,12, What?,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
17891,Sheldon,12, This diagram. I assume you were opening with a joke. It certainly buoyed up this employee's esprit de corps.,4,Big Bang Theory,109,19
17892,Leonard,12, It's not a joke. It's the real design.,4,Big Bang Theory,39,8
17893,Sheldon,12," In that case, may I offer 27 little tweaks to make it slightly less embarrassing?",4,Big Bang Theory,82,15
17894,Leonard,12," Sheldon, I think this will work. Let's just try it my way.",4,Big Bang Theory,59,12
17895,Sheldon,12," Oh, I'm, I'm sorry. I assumed that you wanted candid truth-telling from your employees, but I realize now, you want the mindless nattering of complacent yes-men.",4,Big Bang Theory,162,26
17896,Leonard,12, Are you done?,4,Big Bang Theory,14,3
17897,Sheldon,12," If you say so, boss.",4,Big Bang Theory,21,5
17899,Howard,12," So right now, this button-press event is just triggering a dummy procedure call",4,Big Bang Theory,80,13
17900,Sheldon,12, How about this for the app name? The Surprisingly Helpful Equation-Linked Differential Optimized Numerator.,4,Big Bang Theory,108,14
17901,Raj,12, So it spells Sheldon?,4,Big Bang Theory,22,4
17902,Sheldon,12, Does it? A happy accident.,4,Big Bang Theory,27,5
17903,Leonard,12, We're not doing names now. Howard?,4,Big Bang Theory,35,6
17904,Howard,12," Like I was saying, right now it's just a dummy procedure, but eventually, it will drop us into",4,Big Bang Theory,95,18
17905,Sheldon,12," All right, fine. If we're not going to give it a name, can we at least give it a secret code designation?",4,Big Bang Theory,106,22
17906,Leonard,12, No.,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
17907,Sheldon,12," Well, but hear me out. The atomic bomb was The Manhattan Project. Windows 95 was originally Project Chicago. For our app, I would humbly suggest Project Nodlehs.",4,Big Bang Theory,162,27
17908,Leonard,12, That's just Sheldon backwards.,4,Big Bang Theory,31,4
17909,Sheldon,12, Another happy accident.,4,Big Bang Theory,24,3
17910,Leonard,12, We're not wasting time with names right now.,4,Big Bang Theory,45,8
17911,Sheldon,12, I see. Is that decision open for discussion?,4,Big Bang Theory,45,8
17912,Leonard,12, No.,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
17913,Sheldon,12, Is the decision to not discuss it open for discussion?,4,Big Bang Theory,55,10
17914,Leonard,12, No.,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
17915,Howard,12," Again, right now it's just a dummy procedure, but eventually, it will drop us into",4,Big Bang Theory,83,15
17916,Sheldon,12, I call for a vote of no confidence and an immediate change in leadership.,4,Big Bang Theory,74,14
17917,Leonard,12," Oh Sheldon, stop it.",4,Big Bang Theory,21,4
17918,Sheldon,12," When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary to dissolve the bonds that tie three competent scientists together",4,Big Bang Theory,124,20
17919,Leonard,12," That's enough, Sheldon.",4,Big Bang Theory,24,3
17920,Sheldon,12," All right, let's get right to the vote. Show of hands all those opposed to Leonard and his reign of tyranny.",4,Big Bang Theory,109,21
17921,Leonard,12," Okay, that's it, you're fired.",4,Big Bang Theory,31,5
17922,Sheldon,12, Really? Why?,4,Big Bang Theory,13,2
17923,Leonard,12, Because you're impossible to work with.,4,Big Bang Theory,40,6
17924,Sheldon,12, I see. And is that open for discussion?,4,Big Bang Theory,40,8
17926,Leonard,12, What are you doing?,4,Big Bang Theory,20,4
17927,Sheldon,12," Oh. Good morning, shoemaker. I think you'll be pleased with what the elves were up to last night.",4,Big Bang Theory,98,18
17928,Leonard,12, But I fired you.,4,Big Bang Theory,17,4
17929,Sheldon,12," Oh, I know. I'm now an independent contractor.",4,Big Bang Theory,47,8
17930,Leonard,12," No, you are now nothing. You have no connection to this project whatsoever.",4,Big Bang Theory,76,13
17931,Sheldon,12, But I made it better.,4,Big Bang Theory,22,5
17932,Leonard,12, I don't want it better. I want it my way.,4,Big Bang Theory,42,10
17933,Sheldon,12," Well, that speaks volumes, doesn't it? All right, I suppose I'll go put on my bus pants.",4,Big Bang Theory,89,17
17934,Leonard,12, What the hell are bus pants?,4,Big Bang Theory,29,6
17935,Sheldon,12," They are pants one wears over one's regular pants when one sits on bus seats that other people have previously sat on. But perhaps from your lofty heights atop the corporate ladder, you've lost touch with the struggles of the common man.",4,Big Bang Theory,238,42
17936,Leonard,12," Look, I'm still happy to drive you to work. Nothing's changed in that regard. We're still roommates, we're still friends.",4,Big Bang Theory,122,20
17937,Sheldon,12," Except you identified me, your best friend, as a gangrenous limb that needed to be severed from the organism and tossed away. The desperate act of a little man with a big Napoleon complex.",4,Big Bang Theory,189,34
17938,Leonard,12, You know what? Go put on your bus pants.,4,Big Bang Theory,41,9
17940,Raj,12," Mm. Last night, I had a dream we got so rich from the app, you and I bought matching side-by-side mansions. But there was a secret tunnel connecting your front yard to my back yard. What do you think that means?",4,Big Bang Theory,212,41
17941,Howard,12," It means after we play handball, I'm showering at home.",4,Big Bang Theory,56,10
17942,Sheldon,12," Good morning, Friend Howard. Friend Raj. I see you gentlemen are enjoying beverages. Perhaps they would taste better out of these.",4,Big Bang Theory,131,21
17943,Raj,12, World's Greatest Astrophysicist?,4,Big Bang Theory,33,3
17944,Sheldon,12, Don't thank me. You earned it.,4,Big Bang Theory,31,6
17945,Howard,12, Howard Wolowitz. Why not World's Greatest Engineer?,4,Big Bang Theory,52,7
17946,Sheldon,12," I'm sorry. I typed that into the label maker, but I just couldn't press enter. Now down to business. What would it take for you to abandon Leonard and join me in a rival company? Unless, of course, the mugs are sufficient, in which case, welcome aboard.",4,Big Bang Theory,254,47
17947,Howard,12, We're not quitting on Leonard.,4,Big Bang Theory,31,5
17948,Sheldon,12, I understand. And your loyalty is admirable. But what if I were to up the ante?,4,Big Bang Theory,80,16
17949,Raj,12, What are you talking about?,4,Big Bang Theory,28,5
17950,Sheldon,12," Monogrammed key chains with a built-in laser pointer. No? How about can cosies emblazoned with our university mascot? Go, Beavers. I'll be back.",4,Big Bang Theory,145,23
17952,Howard,12," Okay, let's try this one. Spherical Hankel function.",4,Big Bang Theory,53,8
17953,Leonard,12, Hold on. That's it!,4,Big Bang Theory,20,4
17954,Howard,12, Eureka!,4,Big Bang Theory,8,1
17955,Raj,12," Hey, we agreed when it was Eureka time, we were all gonna say it together.",4,Big Bang Theory,75,15
17956,Howard,12, Fine. Let's say it together.,4,Big Bang Theory,29,5
17957,Raj,12, No. The moment has passed.,4,Big Bang Theory,27,5
17958,Sheldon,12," Greetings, gentlemen. How goes your little project?",4,Big Bang Theory,52,7
17959,Raj,12," You mean, Project Lenwoloppali?",4,Big Bang Theory,32,4
17960,Sheldon,12," Ah, a combination of all your names. Very clever. I assume Koothranardowitz was taken?",4,Big Bang Theory,87,14
17961,Leonard,12, We're actually scanning equations and getting good results.,4,Big Bang Theory,60,8
17962,Sheldon,12," Oh, well then, by all means, carry on. I wouldn't want to impede your progress.",4,Big Bang Theory,80,15
17963,Leonard,12," Howard, did you solve the install time problem yet?",4,Big Bang Theory,52,9
17964,Howard,12, No. It's a little tricky. I'm gonna try having it pick up the libraries dynam,4,Big Bang Theory,78,15
17965,Leonard,12, What are you doing?!,4,Big Bang Theory,21,4
17966,Sheldon,12, Playing the theremin.,4,Big Bang Theory,22,3
17967,Leonard,12," No. I mean, what are you doing with a theremin?",4,Big Bang Theory,48,10
17968,Sheldon,12," Playing it. I've loved the theremin from the first moment I heard the original Star Trek theme. And it's been killing me that it just sits in my closet, gathering dust.",4,Big Bang Theory,169,31
17969,Leonard,12, Sheldon! We're working here!,4,Big Bang Theory,29,4
17970,Sheldon,12," That's all right. I can barely hear you over my theremin.  Well, that was a little uncalled for.",4,Big Bang Theory,97,18
17971,Leonard,12," No, that was completely called for. We need quiet.",4,Big Bang Theory,51,9
17972,Sheldon,12," So, your project is more important than mine?",4,Big Bang Theory,46,8
17973,Leonard,12," Well, seeing as your project is to sabotage my project, yes.",4,Big Bang Theory,61,11
17974,Sheldon,12," Don't beat around the bush, Leonard. If you don't want me here, just say the word, and I'll leave.",4,Big Bang Theory,99,19
17976,Sheldon,12, Could have beaten around the bush a little.,4,Big Bang Theory,44,8
17978,Sheldon,12," Nobody knows the trouble I've seen, nobody knows my sorrow-ow-ow-ow.",4,Big Bang Theory,69,10
17979,Penny,12, What you doing? Trying to contact your home planet?,4,Big Bang Theory,52,9
17980,Sheldon,12, I'm practicing my theremin.,4,Big Bang Theory,28,4
17981,Penny,12, Oh.,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
17982,Sheldon,12," Nobody knows the trouble I've seen. Glory, hallelujah.",4,Big Bang Theory,55,8
17983,Penny,12," Something got you down, there, Sheldon?",4,Big Bang Theory,40,6
17984,Sheldon,12, Leonard kicked me out of my own apartment. And his app team.,4,Big Bang Theory,61,12
17985,Penny,12," Oh, honey, I'm sorry.",4,Big Bang Theory,22,4
17986,Sheldon,12, He wouldn't drive me to work today. I had to wear my bus pants.,4,Big Bang Theory,64,14
17987,Penny,12, Is that so?,4,Big Bang Theory,12,3
17988,Sheldon,12, Yes. And they're still sticky.,4,Big Bang Theory,31,5
17989,Penny,12, Aw.,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
17990,Sheldon,12, Probably going to have to throw them away.,4,Big Bang Theory,43,8
17991,Penny,12," Hey, you don't need Leonard and his app. You can make one with me.",4,Big Bang Theory,67,14
17992,Sheldon,12, With you?,4,Big Bang Theory,10,2
17993,Penny,12," Seriously, I have a great idea for one.",4,Big Bang Theory,40,8
17994,Sheldon,12, Is it better than your idea to move to Los Angeles and become a famous actress?,4,Big Bang Theory,80,16
17995,Penny,12," Okay, look, when you see someone wearing shoes you like, you just snap a picture of them, and the app goes on the Internet to find out where you can buy them.",4,Big Bang Theory,159,32
17996,Sheldon,12, That's your app idea?,4,Big Bang Theory,22,4
17997,Penny,12," Well, you don't like it?",4,Big Bang Theory,25,5
17998,Sheldon,12," I didn't say that. But no, I don't.",4,Big Bang Theory,36,8
17999,Penny,12, Why not?,4,Big Bang Theory,9,2
18000,Sheldon,12," Oh, Penny, where do I begin? The simple-mindedness of your idea is exceeded only by its crass consumerism and banality.",4,Big Bang Theory,120,20
18001,Penny,12, And Leonard didn't want to work with you? Imagine that.,4,Big Bang Theory,56,10
18002,Sheldon,12," I know, it's baffling.  Nobody knows the trouble I've seen.",4,Big Bang Theory,60,10
18003,Penny,12," Sheldon, I'm gonna make some cocoa. Do you want some?",4,Big Bang Theory,54,10
18004,Sheldon,12, Do you make it with milk or water?,4,Big Bang Theory,35,8
18005,Penny,12, Milk.,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
18006,Sheldon,12, Real cocoa?,4,Big Bang Theory,12,2
18007,Penny,12, That's what it says on the packet.,4,Big Bang Theory,35,7
18008,Sheldon,12, Do you have those little marshmallows?,4,Big Bang Theory,39,6
18009,Penny,12," No, sorry.",4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
18010,Sheldon,12," Well, I suppose it's appropriate.",4,Big Bang Theory,34,5
18011,Penny,12, What does that mean?,4,Big Bang Theory,21,4
18012,Sheldon,12, A disappointing drink for a disappointing day.,4,Big Bang Theory,47,7
18014,Raj,12," Hey, look at this. 20 people from the university have already signed up for our private beta.",4,Big Bang Theory,94,17
18015,Leonard,12," I'm telling you, the Lenwoloppali Differential Equation Scanner meets a real need. We've got a hit.",4,Big Bang Theory,100,16
18016,Raj,12, What do you think we should sell it for?,4,Big Bang Theory,41,9
18017,Howard,12," Well, based on the fact that our potential market is about 70 or 80 guys, and you want a submarine, I'd say about a million dollars a pop.",4,Big Bang Theory,139,28
18018,Raj,12," Well, what if we put out a lite version for half a million? You know, get the word of mouth going.",4,Big Bang Theory,99,21
18019,Penny,12," Hi. I'm sorry to bother you guys, but you've got to come take your Sheldon back.",4,Big Bang Theory,81,16
18020,Leonard,12, What's he doing in your apartment?,4,Big Bang Theory,35,6
18021,Penny,12," Well, he was moping down in the lobby, so I invited him over, and now I regret it.",4,Big Bang Theory,83,18
18022,Leonard,12," Why do you regret, uh, never mind, stupid question.",4,Big Bang Theory,52,9
18023,Penny,12," Look, can't you just let him play with you until bedtime?",4,Big Bang Theory,58,11
18024,Leonard,12, We're not playing. This is real work.,4,Big Bang Theory,38,7
18025,Howard,12, We're going to be hundred-aires.,4,Big Bang Theory,33,5
18026,Penny,12, Okay. What if I got him to apologize and promise to behave?,4,Big Bang Theory,60,12
18027,Leonard,12," Then I guess we would let him back on the app team, and while we're doing that, you could take an aerial tour of L.A. on your flying pig.",4,Big Bang Theory,138,29
18028,Penny,12, Okay. Wait right here.,4,Big Bang Theory,23,4
18029,Raj,12," I'll tell you one thing. If I get rich enough, that's the kind of girl I want to take on a submarine ride. And yes, that time, I meant it to be dirty.",4,Big Bang Theory,151,33
18031,Sheldon,12, Really? Leonard wants me back?,4,Big Bang Theory,31,5
18032,Penny,12," Oh, yes. He says they are lost without you.",4,Big Bang Theory,44,9
18033,Sheldon,12," Well, we sure saw that coming.",4,Big Bang Theory,31,6
18034,Penny,12, That's right.,4,Big Bang Theory,14,2
18035,Sheldon,12, You know what I'm going to do? I am going to sit here and just let them stew.,4,Big Bang Theory,78,18
18036,Penny,12," No, no, no. You know, they have suffered enough. Everybody's suffered enough. The thing is, you're going to have to offer him a face-saving way out of this.",4,Big Bang Theory,157,28
18037,Sheldon,12, How?,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
18038,Penny,12, Say you're sorry.,4,Big Bang Theory,18,3
18039,Sheldon,12," Oh, no. Mrs. Mary Cooper didn't raise her no liars.",4,Big Bang Theory,52,10
18040,Penny,12," Okay. Um, how about this? You know how you're always trying to learn about sarcasm?",4,Big Bang Theory,84,15
18041,Sheldon,12, No.,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
18042,Penny,12, No?,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
18043,Sheldon,12, I was being sarcastic.,4,Big Bang Theory,23,4
18044,Penny,12," Oh. Good for you. So all you have to do here is say you're sorry to Leonard, but say it sarcastically.",4,Big Bang Theory,103,21
18045,Sheldon,12," Of course. He will hear it as an attempt to mend fences, as opposed to the withering condemnation you and I will know it to be.",4,Big Bang Theory,128,26
18046,Penny,12," Yeah. Yeah, that was my plan. All right. Come on. Let's go.",4,Big Bang Theory,60,12
18047,Sheldon,12," Oh, by the way, thank you for the delicious cocoa.",4,Big Bang Theory,51,10
18048,Penny,12," Oh, you're welcome.",4,Big Bang Theory,20,3
18049,Sheldon,12," Boy, I'm getting good at this.",4,Big Bang Theory,31,6
18051,Leonard,12," Okay, now that you're back on the team, let's get you caught up.",4,Big Bang Theory,65,13
18052,Sheldon,12," Before you begin, let me say again how deeply sorry I am for my earlier behaviour and how much I respect and admire your leadership.",4,Big Bang Theory,133,25
18053,Leonard,12," Thank you. So as you can see, not only can you store your favourite equations, but you can forward them to your friends or post them on Facebook right from the app.",4,Big Bang Theory,165,32
18054,Sheldon,12," Well, I must say, I am impressed.",4,Big Bang Theory,34,7
18055,Leonard,12, Thanks.,4,Big Bang Theory,8,1
18056,Sheldon,12, You all have clearly put in a lot of hard work.,4,Big Bang Theory,48,11
18057,Howard,12, We have.,4,Big Bang Theory,9,2
18058,Sheldon,12," As a result, you have taken the most important step on the road to success, learning what not to do. Now, let's start fresh. Howard, we're going to need some tea.",4,Big Bang Theory,163,31
18060,Penny,12," Okay, these are Uggs. These are Crocs. These are knockoff Manolo Blahniks.",4,Big Bang Theory,75,12
18061,Sheldon,12, Bored.,4,Big Bang Theory,7,1
18062,Penny,12," Look, you said it yourself, we have to create a database before you can write an alga-thingy.",4,Big Bang Theory,94,17
18063,Sheldon,12," Algorithm. You see, Penny, Alan Turing defined an algorithm",4,Big Bang Theory,60,9
18064,Penny,12," Bored. Okay. These are Steve Maddens. These are Nine West. These are Target. Oh, but don't they look like Chanel? These are Michael Kors. These are Roxy. These are Sachel's. Oh, these are Betsy Johnson, they're so cute",4,Big Bang Theory,219,38
18065,Sheldon,12," Nobody knows the trouble I've seen, nobody knows my sorrow",4,Big Bang Theory,59,10
18067,Penny,13, Hey. So you guys ready to order?,4,Big Bang Theory,33,7
18068,Sheldon,13," Since we come in every Tuesday night at six o'clock and order the same exact thing, and it's now six oh eight, I believe your question not only answers itself but also stands alongside such other nonsensical queries as who let the dogs out? and, uh, How are they hanging?",4,Big Bang Theory,272,50
18069,Penny,13," Okay. So, the usual, with extra spit on Sheldon's hamburger.",4,Big Bang Theory,61,10
18070,Amy,13," Penny, a moment? Do you have plans this weekend?",4,Big Bang Theory,49,9
18071,Penny,13," Oh, gee, Amy, I'm sorry, I'm actually pretty busy this weekend.",4,Big Bang Theory,64,11
18072,Sheldon,13, Probably serving food that was ordered today.,4,Big Bang Theory,46,7
18073,Amy,13, That's too bad. I was hoping you could be my plus-one at the Institute of Interdisciplinary Studies' symposium on the impact of current scientific research on societal interactions.,4,Big Bang Theory,182,28
18074,Penny,13, The what?,4,Big Bang Theory,10,2
18075,Leonard,13, It's an annual science conference. We've all been invited to speak.,4,Big Bang Theory,68,11
18076,Penny,13," Oh. Oh, okay, well, you know, like I said, I have plans, so.",4,Big Bang Theory,61,13
18077,Amy,13," Shame. Since you're my best friend, I thought it would be a good bonding opportunity.",4,Big Bang Theory,86,15
18078,Penny,13, I'm your best friend?,4,Big Bang Theory,22,4
18079,Amy,13, Don't you read my blog?,4,Big Bang Theory,24,5
18080,Penny,13," Oh, don't feel bad. I never read Leonard's, and I used to sleep with him.",4,Big Bang Theory,74,15
18081,Amy,13, Do you know anybody else who would appreciate an all-expense-paid spa weekend at a four-star resort in Big Sur?,4,Big Bang Theory,112,19
18082,Penny,13," No, I really, I'm sorry, free what? Sorry, what, what?",4,Big Bang Theory,55,10
18083,Leonard,13, I think her weekend just opened up.,4,Big Bang Theory,36,7
18084,Penny,13," Wait, wait, just to be clear, when you guys say spa, does that mean the same thing as when regular people say it?",4,Big Bang Theory,114,23
18085,Leonard,13, Pretty much. Except we keep our shirts on in the sauna.,4,Big Bang Theory,56,11
18086,Penny,13," You know, it is going to be difficult, but I'm going to cancel my plans so I can do this for my bestie.",4,Big Bang Theory,104,23
18087,Amy,13, Please don't touch my breasts.,4,Big Bang Theory,31,5
18088,Penny,13," I, I wasn't going to.",4,Big Bang Theory,22,5
18089,Amy,13, All right. I just want to establish boundaries.,4,Big Bang Theory,48,8
18090,Penny,13," Boy, this is great. I haven't had a vacation in ages.",4,Big Bang Theory,54,11
18091,Sheldon,13," In order to take a vacation, one first has to work.",4,Big Bang Theory,52,11
18092,Penny,13," You know, for a smart guy, you really seem to have a hard time grasping the concept, don't piss off the people who handle the things you eat.",4,Big Bang Theory,142,28
18093,Amy,13, That does seem to be a valid principle.,4,Big Bang Theory,40,8
18094,Sheldon,13, I trust Penny will adhere to the Official California Restaurant Workers' Solemn Oath of Ethics and Cleanliness.â€ù,4,Big Bang Theory,115,17
18095,Amy,13, I don't believe there's any such thing.,4,Big Bang Theory,40,7
18096,Sheldon,13, You lied to me?,4,Big Bang Theory,16,4
18098,Sheldon,13," Good morning. If I could have everyone's attention, please? I know we're all eager to get on the road to Big Sur, so if we focus, I'm sure we can get through this orientation in under a half an hour. Then it's just Q&A, quiz, safety drills, pose for commemorative group photo and we're off.",4,Big Bang Theory,291,55
18099,Leonard,13," Don't worry. Just sit next to me during the quiz, and you can copy my answers.",4,Big Bang Theory,79,16
18100,Sheldon,13," Raj? What are you doing? I don't think so. You've had your allotted six ounces. The first bathroom break isn't until the Denny's located near Bakersfield, which is approximately two and half hours away. Remember, people, we're only as strong as our weakest bladder.",4,Big Bang Theory,266,44
18101,Howard,13, Nobody cares about your Kegel exercises.,4,Big Bang Theory,41,6
18102,Sheldon,13," All right. We have seven people, and two cars. In the lead car, driven by Leonard, will be myself, Amy Farrah Fowler and Penny.",4,Big Bang Theory,128,24
18103,Amy,13," Yes! He had you in the other car, but I got you upgraded.",4,Big Bang Theory,58,13
18104,Penny,13, Yay!,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
18105,Sheldon,13," She made the case that if we break down in the middle of nowhere, your Nebraska backwoods skills and brawny hands will give us the best chance to survive in the wild.",4,Big Bang Theory,167,32
18106,Penny,13, Brawny?,4,Big Bang Theory,8,1
18107,Leonard,13, They're bigger than mine.,4,Big Bang Theory,26,4
18109,Sheldon,13," Red Leader to Red Five, come in. Red Leader to Red Five, come in. Howard, you promised.",4,Big Bang Theory,88,17
18110,Howard,13, Fine. Red Five to Red Leader. What do you want now?,4,Big Bang Theory,52,11
18111,Sheldon,13, It's eleven fifteen. I'm requesting your quarter-hourly location update.,4,Big Bang Theory,73,9
18112,Howard,13, Still right behind you.,4,Big Bang Theory,24,4
18113,Sheldon,13," Copy that, Red Five. Radio contact is sufficient. No need to extend your middle finger.",4,Big Bang Theory,88,15
18114,Penny,13," So, Amy, I've been wondering, are you and Sheldon going to be sharing a room?",4,Big Bang Theory,78,15
18115,Amy,13," No, we discussed it. We decided we didn't want to jeopardize our relationship by getting to know each other too well.",4,Big Bang Theory,118,21
18116,Sheldon,13, Indeed. Nothing sours a friendship more than over-familiarity with someone's toilet routine.,4,Big Bang Theory,93,12
18117,Leonard,13, I can vouch for that.,4,Big Bang Theory,22,5
18118,Penny,13, Hey.,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
18119,Leonard,13," Not you, him.",4,Big Bang Theory,14,3
18120,Penny,13, Oh. Thanks.,4,Big Bang Theory,12,2
18121,Leonard,13, Although yours was an eye-opener.,4,Big Bang Theory,34,5
18122,Amy,13," Don't worry, Penny. You're my plus-one. You'll bunk with me. And FYI, travel makes me constipated, so I'm the ideal hotel roommate.",4,Big Bang Theory,132,22
18123,Penny,13, Terrific. Are we there yet?,4,Big Bang Theory,28,5
18126,Howard,13, Really? You want to see the keynote?,4,Big Bang Theory,37,7
18127,Howard,13," Actually, I was thinking we could go straight to the room and take a nap.",4,Big Bang Theory,74,15
18129,Howard,13," We can watch it later on C-SPAN. Besides, I was really looking forward to you and me napping together in the hotel.",4,Big Bang Theory,116,22
18131,Howard,13," No, see, it's not",4,Big Bang Theory,18,4
18133,Leonard,13," Yeah, hi. Listen, I just got a text from Raj. He wanted me to tell you that when Howard says nap, he means sex.",4,Big Bang Theory,112,24
18136,Leonard,13, Are you an element in the actinoid series?,4,Big Bang Theory,43,8
18137,Sheldon,13, No. Amy?,4,Big Bang Theory,9,2
18138,Amy,13, Are you usually radioactive when found in nature?,4,Big Bang Theory,50,8
18139,Sheldon,13, No.,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
18140,Amy,13, Are you in the lanthanoid series?,4,Big Bang Theory,34,6
18141,Sheldon,13," Amy, it's Penny's turn. Penny?",4,Big Bang Theory,31,5
18142,Penny,13," Uh, I don't know. Are you food?",4,Big Bang Theory,32,7
18143,Sheldon,13, That's not apropos. We've already established I'm found in the periodic table.,4,Big Bang Theory,79,12
18144,Penny,13," Well, it's a table, right? I mean, why can't there be food on it?",4,Big Bang Theory,66,14
18145,Sheldon,13, I knew she wasn't lead car material.,4,Big Bang Theory,37,7
18146,Penny,13, Who elected you Road Trip God?,4,Big Bang Theory,31,6
18147,Sheldon,13, Leonard.,4,Big Bang Theory,9,1
18148,Leonard,13," It was a late-night vote. We were all exhausted, and he was threatening to filibuster. It's not technically Road Trip God, it's Travel Supervisor.",4,Big Bang Theory,147,24
18149,Sheldon,13, Although Road Trip God does have a certain ring to it.,4,Big Bang Theory,55,11
18150,Penny,13, I don't understand why you people just let him bully you like this. Someone should stand up to him. What's he going to do?,4,Big Bang Theory,123,24
18152,Penny,13, I can't believe you let him kick me out of the car.,4,Big Bang Theory,52,12
18153,Howard,13, What could we do? He's the Travel Supervisor.,4,Big Bang Theory,46,8
18155,Howard,13, Yeah. It's the Love Car.,4,Big Bang Theory,25,5
18156,Penny,13, Should I ask?,4,Big Bang Theory,14,3
18158,Howard,13," Well, I don't know if all that's true, 'cause you got me, and, baby, I got you.",4,Big Bang Theory,80,17
18160,Penny,13," Red Leader, I'm really sorry.",4,Big Bang Theory,30,5
18163,Amy,13, I missed you.,4,Big Bang Theory,14,3
18164,Penny,13," You know what? I missed you, too.",4,Big Bang Theory,34,7
18172,Howard,13, Hi. Ow. Hi.,4,Big Bang Theory,12,3
18174,Howard,13, Yes. Bernie sure is.,4,Big Bang Theory,21,4
18178,Howard,13," Hey, Bernie?",4,Big Bang Theory,13,2
18180,Howard,13, Please tell me he's your gay cousin.,4,Big Bang Theory,37,7
18182,Howard,13, Oh! That's a relief.,4,Big Bang Theory,21,4
18184,Howard,13," No, it's not necessarily proportional. Shut up!",4,Big Bang Theory,48,7
18186,Howard,13," That green bag is Dr. Cooper's. Here's an extra five. Make him wait. Oh. Right to the nap, huh? Okay? Uh, so, this Glenn guy. You say you went out with him for, like, a year.",4,Big Bang Theory,175,36
18188,Howard,13," No. I guess not. What is he, like, six-four, six-five?",4,Big Bang Theory,55,10
18190,Howard,13, Probably has a hard time finding a suit that fits.,4,Big Bang Theory,51,10
18192,Howard,13, No. It's just,4,Big Bang Theory,14,3
18194,Howard,13," I'm just thinking. If you had sex with that guy, I mean, there's nothing I can do here that will make any kind of impact.",4,Big Bang Theory,122,25
18196,Howard,13," Yeah, great, love you, too, but, if it were a contest, I wouldn't have a chance, right?",4,Big Bang Theory,88,17
18198,Howard,13, Yep. Loser.,4,Big Bang Theory,12,2
18200,Howard,13, Sorry. I just never figured that a guy like me going out with a girl like you would ever have to compete with a guy like that.,4,Big Bang Theory,127,27
18202,Howard,13, I'm I,4,Big Bang Theory,6,2
18204,Howard,13," No! No, I'm saying exactly the opposite.",4,Big Bang Theory,41,7
18206,Howard,13," Yeah, let's go with that.",4,Big Bang Theory,26,5
18208,Amy,13, Still nothing. Remind me to try again in an hour.,4,Big Bang Theory,50,10
18209,Penny,13, Will do.,4,Big Bang Theory,9,2
18210,Amy,13," So, girl talk?",4,Big Bang Theory,15,3
18211,Penny,13," Um, sure. What do you, what do you got in mind?",4,Big Bang Theory,48,11
18212,Amy,13, Do you subscribe to the Freudian theory of penis envy?,4,Big Bang Theory,55,10
18213,Penny,13," Um, I never really thought about it. Why?",4,Big Bang Theory,42,8
18214,Amy,13, Sometimes I think it might be nice to have one.,4,Big Bang Theory,48,10
18215,Penny,13, Really?,4,Big Bang Theory,8,1
18216,Amy,13," Not for sex, for convenience. You can't deny that, by comparison, our internal plumbing is extremely high maintenance.",4,Big Bang Theory,119,18
18217,Penny,13," Again, I've never given it much thought.",4,Big Bang Theory,41,7
18218,Amy,13, We have time now. Think about it.,4,Big Bang Theory,34,7
18219,Penny,13," Oh, good. Hey.",4,Big Bang Theory,15,3
18221,Penny,13," Yeah. Why, what happened?",4,Big Bang Theory,26,4
18223,Penny,13," Oh, yeah, that. Come on in.",4,Big Bang Theory,28,6
18225,Amy,13, Not necessary. Penny and I are perfectly comfortable sharing a bed.,4,Big Bang Theory,68,11
18226,Penny,13, We are?,4,Big Bang Theory,8,2
18227,Amy,13," Of course, we're best friends.",4,Big Bang Theory,31,5
18228,Penny,13," Oh, right, right, the blog.",4,Big Bang Theory,28,5
18229,Amy,13," Word of warning, though. I'm prone to night terrors, so if I wake up kicking and screaming, don't panic. Just pin me down and stroke my hair, and I'll be fine.",4,Big Bang Theory,160,31
18231,Penny,13," Hey, can I stay here tonight?",4,Big Bang Theory,30,6
18232,Leonard,13, Shh-shh-shh-shh. Sheldon's asleep. What's going on?,4,Big Bang Theory,52,6
18233,Penny,13," Well, Howard's a complete and total ass, Bernadette's in my bed, and no matter how much you stroke Amy's hair, she bites.",4,Big Bang Theory,122,22
18234,Leonard,13, What?,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
18235,Penny,13, Never mind. Can I stay here or not?,4,Big Bang Theory,36,8
18236,Leonard,13," Uh, sure.",4,Big Bang Theory,10,2
18237,Penny,13, All right.,4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
18238,Leonard,13," So, how do you wanna do this?",4,Big Bang Theory,30,7
18239,Penny,13," Well, I'm not getting in bed with him.",4,Big Bang Theory,39,8
18240,Leonard,13," Yeah, it is a little like getting into Dracula's coffin.",4,Big Bang Theory,57,10
18241,Penny,13, We're just gonna have to make the best of this.,4,Big Bang Theory,48,10
18242,Leonard,13," Okay, when you say make the best of it.",4,Big Bang Theory,40,9
18243,Penny,13, Sleep.,4,Big Bang Theory,7,1
18244,Leonard,13, Right. So we'll just call the middle here the Neutral Zone.,4,Big Bang Theory,60,11
18245,Penny,13, The what?,4,Big Bang Theory,10,2
18246,Leonard,13," Star Trek. You know, the Neutral Zone between the Federation and the Romulan Empire.",4,Big Bang Theory,85,14
18247,Penny,13," Oh, okay. Just like old times.",4,Big Bang Theory,31,6
18248,Leonard,13," Of course, sometimes the Federation and the Romulans would enter the Neutral Zone to negotiate a temporary truce.",4,Big Bang Theory,114,18
18249,Penny,13," Sweetie, let me put this in a way you'll understand. From the waist down, my shields are up.",4,Big Bang Theory,93,18
18250,Leonard,13," Got it, got it. We can do all kinds of stuff from the waist up, you know?",4,Big Bang Theory,74,17
18251,Penny,13, Go to sleep.,4,Big Bang Theory,13,3
18252,Leonard,13, Good night.,4,Big Bang Theory,12,2
18253,Sheldon,13, Please tell me you're not having coitus.,4,Big Bang Theory,41,7
18254,Penny,13, We are not having coitus.,4,Big Bang Theory,26,5
18255,Sheldon,13, Can you guarantee that it won't happen at any time during the night?,4,Big Bang Theory,69,13
18256,Penny,13, Yes.,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
18257,Leonard,13, No.,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
18260,Raj,13," Oh, my God, I'm crying already.",4,Big Bang Theory,32,6
18261,Sheldon,13,  Raj?  Raj?  Raj? I need to sleep here tonight.,4,Big Bang Theory,48,9
18262,Raj,13, Why?,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
18263,Sheldon,13," Howard is a complete and total ass, Bernadette is in Penny's bed, Amy bites, and Penny may or may not have coitus with Leonard.",4,Big Bang Theory,128,24
18264,Raj,13, Okay. Come on in.,4,Big Bang Theory,18,4
18266,Penny,13," Leonard, are you asleep?",4,Big Bang Theory,25,4
18267,Leonard,13, No.,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
18268,Penny,13, I really appreciate you letting me stay here tonight.,4,Big Bang Theory,54,9
18269,Leonard,13," Sure, no problem.",4,Big Bang Theory,18,3
18270,Penny,13, I know it's kinda weird.,4,Big Bang Theory,25,5
18271,Leonard,13, True dat.,4,Big Bang Theory,10,2
18272,Penny,13, True dat?,4,Big Bang Theory,10,2
18273,Leonard,13, I've gotten a lot more street since we broke up.,4,Big Bang Theory,49,10
18274,Penny,13, Right. Still mad at me about that?,4,Big Bang Theory,35,7
18275,Leonard,13," No. No, I understand. I got too intense, you had to back off.",4,Big Bang Theory,62,13
18276,Penny,13, Thank you.,4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
18277,Leonard,13," I've gotten a lot better at that, you know. I've dated four different women since we broke up and I didn't tell any of them that I loved them and wanted to have their babies.",4,Big Bang Theory,175,35
18278,Penny,13, Good for you.,4,Big Bang Theory,14,3
18279,Leonard,13," Okay, good night.",4,Big Bang Theory,18,3
18280,Penny,13," Good night. You know, maybe it wouldn't be the worst idea in the world to violate the Neutral Zone for just one night. Oh!",4,Big Bang Theory,123,24
18281,Raj,13," Hey, Leonard, Sheldon kicked me out of the room, gave me your key.",4,Big Bang Theory,67,13
18282,Leonard,13," Penny's here.  No, we don't want to watch Bridget Jones's Diary!",4,Big Bang Theory,65,11
18284,Sheldon,13," Good morning and welcome to Science and Society. I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper, BS, MS, MA, PhD, and ScD. OMG, right? Perhaps that joke was a little too hippie-dippy for this crowd. All right then, we'll begin with opening remarks. Miss Rostenkowski, would you like to start us off by discussing your assessment of science's responsibility to society?",4,Big Bang Theory,345,57
18286,Howard,13," Interesting. I think what you might need to know about my colleague is that though she claims her field of interest is tiny organisms, she certainly has spent her fair share of time around what we can assume was pretty massive weaponry.",4,Big Bang Theory,237,42
18288,Amy,13, Are we talking about women wanting penises? Because I'd like to weigh in.,4,Big Bang Theory,74,13
18289,Sheldon,13," Dr. Koothrappali, would you care to join the conversation?",4,Big Bang Theory,59,9
18290,Raj,13," Certainly. I'd like to raise two points. Number one, I think they are talking about penises. And number two, these mimosas are kicking my little brown ass.",4,Big Bang Theory,156,27
18291,Leonard,13, I'd like to kick your little brown ass.,4,Big Bang Theory,40,8
18292,Raj,13, What did I do?,4,Big Bang Theory,15,4
18293,Leonard,13," Oh, I don't know. Maybe when you walk into a hotel room and you see a guy getting back together with his girlfriend, you should consider doing something other than crawling into the adjoining bed.",4,Big Bang Theory,197,35
18294,Raj,13, I did. You said no Bridget Jones.,4,Big Bang Theory,34,7
18295,Penny,13, We weren't getting back together! It was a one-time thing!,4,Big Bang Theory,59,10
18296,Sheldon,13, Excuse me. We're not taking comments or questions from the audience just yet.,4,Big Bang Theory,78,13
18297,Penny,13," Oh, shut up, Sheldon!",4,Big Bang Theory,22,4
18298,Amy,13," Hi, bestie.",4,Big Bang Theory,12,2
18299,Penny,13," Yeah, hi.",4,Big Bang Theory,10,2
18300,Sheldon,13," All right, why don't we see if we can bring this back to topic.",4,Big Bang Theory,64,14
18301,Howard,13," Let me ask you something, Bernie.",4,Big Bang Theory,34,6
18302,Sheldon,13, I guess not.,4,Big Bang Theory,13,3
18303,Howard,13, How would you feel if you met my ex-girlfriend and she was like Angelina Jolie?,4,Big Bang Theory,80,15
18305,Howard,13," What, I'm not hot enough for Angelina Jolie?",4,Big Bang Theory,45,8
18306,Raj,13, I'd like to weigh in here. No.,4,Big Bang Theory,31,7
18307,Sheldon,13," All right, why don't we open it up to Q&A from the audience?",4,Big Bang Theory,61,13
18308,Penny,13," Yeah, I have a question. Is there anybody who can get me the hell out of here and back to Los Angeles tonight?",4,Big Bang Theory,111,23
18311,Leonard,13, No!,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
18313,Sheldon,13," Red Leader to Red Five. Red Leader to Red Five. Anybody up for a little game? I spy with my little eye, a nonferrous metal. ",4,Big Bang Theory,125,25
18315,Sheldon,13, Must be out of range.,4,Big Bang Theory,22,5
18316,Amy,13," Leonard, can I ask you a question?",4,Big Bang Theory,35,7
18317,Leonard,13, Sure.,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
18318,Amy,13, Are you bothered by the fact that your former girlfriend left the symposium with what is probably the most beautiful man I've ever seen in my life?,4,Big Bang Theory,148,27
18319,Leonard,13, No. Why do you ask?,4,Big Bang Theory,20,5
18320,Amy,13, Because we're going 120 miles per hour.,4,Big Bang Theory,40,7
18321,Sheldon,13," All right, if no one's going to guess, I was spying the aluminium rims on the police car we passed a few miles back.",4,Big Bang Theory,117,24
18323,Sheldon,14," Good evening. I'm your guest lecturer, Dr. Sheldon Cooper. I was expecting applause, but I suppose stunned silence is equally appropriate. I agreed to speak to you this evening, because I was told that you're the best and the brightest of this university's doctoral candidates. Hmm. Of course, that's like saying you are the most important electron in a hydrogen atom. â€˜Cause, you see, there's only one electron in a hydrogen atom. Best and brightest, my sweet patootie. All right, let's begin. Show of hands, who here is familiar with the concept of topological insulators? Don't kid yourselves.",4,Big Bang Theory,599,98
18325,Leonard,14," I found another tweet from a student at Sheldon's lecture. Dr. Cooper has taken a relatively boring subject and managed to make it completely insufferable. Plus, he looks like a giant insect.",4,Big Bang Theory,192,32
18326,Howard,14," Look. Listen to this one. Does Einstein's theory explain why time flies when you're having fun, but when you're listening to Dr. Cooper, it falls out of the sky, dead?",4,Big Bang Theory,168,30
18327,Raj,14," Ooh, somebody took pictures and uploaded them to their Flickr account.",4,Big Bang Theory,71,11
18328,Leonard,14, Wow. How do you get an entire lecture hall to flip you off at the same time?,4,Big Bang Theory,77,17
18329,Howard,14," Apparently, if you're Sheldon, all you need to do is turn your back.",4,Big Bang Theory,69,13
18330,Penny,14," Hey, Leonard, is your wi-fi down? I can't get on.",4,Big Bang Theory,50,10
18331,Leonard,14," Oh, Sheldon changed the password. It's now Penny is a freeloader. No spaces.",4,Big Bang Theory,77,13
18332,Penny,14, Thanks. What are you guys doing?,4,Big Bang Theory,33,6
18333,Leonard,14, Sheldon gave a lecture at the university tonight. We're reading the reviews.,4,Big Bang Theory,77,12
18334,Penny,14, Oh. How'd he do?,4,Big Bang Theory,17,4
18335,Howard,14," Well, picture the Hindenburg meets Chernobyl meets Three Mile Island meets Tron 2.",4,Big Bang Theory,83,13
18336,Penny,14," That bad, huh?",4,Big Bang Theory,15,3
18337,Leonard,14, Read this woman's tweet.,4,Big Bang Theory,25,4
18338,Penny,14, Listening to Dr. Cooper has made me want to start cutting myself again,4,Big Bang Theory,71,13
18339,Leonard,14, Yeah.,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
18340,Sheldon,14," Good evening, Leonard, Howard, Raj, freeloader.",4,Big Bang Theory,48,6
18341,Howard,14," So, how'd the lecture go?",4,Big Bang Theory,26,5
18342,Leonard,14," In a word, triumphant.",4,Big Bang Theory,23,4
18343,Leonard,14, Really? Triumphant?,4,Big Bang Theory,20,2
18344,Sheldon,14," Oh, yes, you should have seen those young people. Thirsty for knowledge, drinking in my wisdom. I may have changed a few lives today.",4,Big Bang Theory,134,24
18345,Penny,14," Oh, please let me tell him.",4,Big Bang Theory,28,6
18346,Leonard,14," I don't know, I kind of promised Howard.",4,Big Bang Theory,41,8
18347,Sheldon,14, Tell me what?,4,Big Bang Theory,14,3
18348,Howard,14," Actually, we should all share the moment. Raj, if you would.",4,Big Bang Theory,61,11
18349,Sheldon,14," Oh, tweets about my lecture. Hmm. That's rather unfair. That's downright cruel. Plus, insects have six legs. Yeah, I'm not familiar with the acronym KMN.",4,Big Bang Theory,154,25
18350,Leonard,14," Oh, uh, from the context, we think it means kill me now.",4,Big Bang Theory,57,12
18351,Sheldon,14," Well, I suppose everyone's entitled to their own opinion. I think I'll turn in. I didn't want to teach those poopy heads, anyway.",4,Big Bang Theory,130,23
18352,Howard,14," FYI, I think that's what Darth Vader said just before he started building the Death Star.",4,Big Bang Theory,90,16
18354,Howard,14, Sheldon still moping?,4,Big Bang Theory,22,3
18355,Leonard,14," Yeah, it's weird. Even though he didn't want to give the lecture in the first place, being rejected by those students really hit him hard.",4,Big Bang Theory,139,25
18356,Raj,14," Mmm, I know the feeling. It's like accidentally walking into a gay bar and then having no one hit on you. It-It happened to a friend of mine.",4,Big Bang Theory,142,28
18358,Howard,14," Yeah, Leonard and I are fine, but I think Raj needs to meet a girl really soon.",4,Big Bang Theory,80,17
18360,Raj,14," Thank you, but cute is for bunnies. I want to be something with sex appeal, like, like a labradoodle.",4,Big Bang Theory,102,19
18361,Howard,14, Labradoodle?,4,Big Bang Theory,13,1
18362,Leonard,14, We might be starting to zero in on your problem.,4,Big Bang Theory,49,10
18364,Raj,14, You really think so?,4,Big Bang Theory,21,4
18366,Raj,14," Well, thanks, Bernadette. And just for the record, labradoodles are hypo-allergenic, which is a very sexy quality to those troubled by animal dander.",4,Big Bang Theory,150,23
18368,Amy,14," So, what do you think?",4,Big Bang Theory,23,5
18369,Sheldon,14," It's a charming illusion, but it does not cheer me up.",4,Big Bang Theory,55,11
18370,Amy,14, Not even when I do this? ,4,Big Bang Theory,26,6
18371,Sheldon,14, No.,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
18372,Amy,14," Well, that was the last arrow in my quiver of whimsy.",4,Big Bang Theory,54,11
18373,Sheldon,14, Do you realize that teaching is the first thing I've failed at since my ill-fated attempt to complete a chin-up in March of 1989?,4,Big Bang Theory,130,24
18374,Amy,14," If this humiliating experience is really troubling you, there are things we could do about it.",4,Big Bang Theory,95,16
18375,Sheldon,14, For instance?,4,Big Bang Theory,14,2
18376,Amy,14," Well, the first thing that comes to mind is isolating the part of your brain where the memory is stored and destroying it with a laser.",4,Big Bang Theory,136,26
18377,Sheldon,14," Hmm, no. One slip of the hand, and suddenly I'm sitting in the Engineering Department, building doodads with Wolowitz.",4,Big Bang Theory,119,19
18378,Amy,14," All right. Have you considered improving your socialization skills, thus allowing you to communicate more effectively with other people?",4,Big Bang Theory,137,19
18379,Sheldon,14, Isn't that their burden? I'm the one with something interesting to say.,4,Big Bang Theory,72,12
18380,Amy,14," Fair enough, but in its essence, teaching is a performance art. In the classroom paradigm, the teacher has the responsibility to communicate, as well as entertain and engage.",4,Big Bang Theory,175,28
18381,Sheldon,14, I sense that you're trying to slow-walk me to an epiphany. Would you mind very much jumping to it?,4,Big Bang Theory,99,19
18382,Amy,14, Perhaps you should consider taking acting lessons.,4,Big Bang Theory,51,7
18383,Sheldon,14, Acting lessons. Interesting. It might help if I could act as though I care about my students and whether or not they learn.,4,Big Bang Theory,124,23
18385,Sheldon,14,  Penny.  Penny.  Penny.,4,Big Bang Theory,24,3
18386,Penny,14, What?,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
18387,Sheldon,14," You're an  actress, correct?",4,Big Bang Theory,29,4
18388,Penny,14, I'm not an actress. I'm an actress.,4,Big Bang Theory,36,7
18389,Sheldon,14, All right. You're an actress. I need you to teach me.,4,Big Bang Theory,54,11
18390,Penny,14, You want an acting lesson?,4,Big Bang Theory,27,5
18391,Sheldon,14, Perhaps two. I'd like to master the craft.,4,Big Bang Theory,43,8
18392,Penny,14," Okay, where is this coming from?",4,Big Bang Theory,33,6
18393,Sheldon,14," It has been suggested to me that acting techniques could improve my lecturing, at which, if certain tweets and blogs are to be believed, I suck the big one.",4,Big Bang Theory,157,29
18394,Penny,14," Yeah, I saw those. They were funny. I printed a few out and put 'em on my fridge.",4,Big Bang Theory,82,18
18395,Sheldon,14," So, when could we start?",4,Big Bang Theory,25,5
18396,Penny,14," Okay, just to be clear. You are asking me for help because I know something that the brilliant Dr. Sheldon Cooper doesn't.",4,Big Bang Theory,123,22
18397,Sheldon,14, I suppose that's one way to look at it.,4,Big Bang Theory,40,9
18398,Penny,14, I think it's the only way to look at it.,4,Big Bang Theory,41,10
18399,Sheldon,14, Are you going to help me or not?,4,Big Bang Theory,33,8
18400,Penny,14, Probably. I'm just enjoying the foreplay. Does this mean you are done mocking my acting career?,4,Big Bang Theory,96,16
18401,Sheldon,14," Oh, I'm sorry, I thought making the transition from actor to acting teacher was the signal that one's career had reached the end of the road.",4,Big Bang Theory,142,26
18402,Penny,14, Forget it.,4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
18403,Sheldon,14, I'll pay you 40 dollars.,4,Big Bang Theory,25,5
18404,Penny,14," Saturday, nine a.m. Bring cash.",4,Big Bang Theory,32,5
18406,Howard,14," Raj, I have amazing news!",4,Big Bang Theory,26,5
18407,Raj,14, What?,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
18408,Howard,14, I just got offered a fellowship at the Weitzmann Institute in Israel.,4,Big Bang Theory,70,12
18409,Raj,14," Dude, that's incredible!",4,Big Bang Theory,25,3
18410,Howard,14," I know. The only thing is, I'm gonna be gone for two years.",4,Big Bang Theory,60,13
18411,Raj,14," Aw, I'm gonna miss you. Are you going with him?",4,Big Bang Theory,48,10
18413,Howard,14," That's what we're here to talk to you about. You see, Bernadette has needs.",4,Big Bang Theory,76,14
18414,Raj,14, What kind of needs?,4,Big Bang Theory,20,4
18415,Howard,14, Sexual needs.,4,Big Bang Theory,14,2
18417,Howard,14," So, while I'm gone, you're going to have to satisfy her.",4,Big Bang Theory,57,11
18419,Raj,14, I say okey-dokey.,4,Big Bang Theory,18,3
18420,Howard,14, What ya thinking so hard about?,4,Big Bang Theory,32,6
18421,Raj,14, Just that I'm definitely not gay.,4,Big Bang Theory,34,6
18423,Sheldon,14,  Penny.  Penny.  Penny.,4,Big Bang Theory,24,3
18424,Penny,14, What's wrong?,4,Big Bang Theory,14,2
18425,Sheldon,14, Nothing. I was acting.,4,Big Bang Theory,23,4
18426,Penny,14, You were acting?,4,Big Bang Theory,17,3
18427,Sheldon,14," Yes. In preparation for today's studies, I read Stanislavski's An Actor Prepares, Stella Adler's",4,Big Bang Theory,97,14
18428,Penny,14," Well, good for you. Come on in.",4,Big Bang Theory,32,7
18429,Sheldon,14, How shall we begin?,4,Big Bang Theory,20,4
18430,Penny,14," Well, I thought we'd start with some basic movement exercises. You know, get our bodies warmed up a little.",4,Big Bang Theory,108,19
18431,Sheldon,14, All right.,4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
18432,Penny,14," So I just want you to relax and kind of move around in the space. You know, just do whatever feels natural. Sheldon?",4,Big Bang Theory,117,23
18433,Sheldon,14, You said to do whatever feels natural. This feels natural. Certainly more natural than what you're doing.,4,Big Bang Theory,106,17
18434,Penny,14," Come on, you got to work with me. We need to get connected with our bodies.",4,Big Bang Theory,76,16
18435,Sheldon,14," Penny, my body and I have a relationship that works best when we maintain a cool, wary distance from each other.",4,Big Bang Theory,113,21
18436,Penny,14," All right, let's just say we've warmed up.",4,Big Bang Theory,43,8
18437,Sheldon,14, You're the teacher.,4,Big Bang Theory,20,3
18438,Penny,14, Okay. One of the things that might help you in connecting with your students is being a little more spontaneous. So why don't we try some improvisation?,4,Big Bang Theory,153,27
18439,Sheldon,14, Why not? It seems like you're improvising your entire curriculum.,4,Big Bang Theory,66,10
18440,Penny,14, This is all about listening and responding.,4,Big Bang Theory,44,7
18441,Sheldon,14, Gotcha.,4,Big Bang Theory,8,1
18442,Penny,14," I'm going to create a character and a situation, and you just jump in when you feel it.",4,Big Bang Theory,88,18
18443,Sheldon,14, All right.,4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
18444,Penny,14, All right.,4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
18445,Sheldon,14, Action.,4,Big Bang Theory,8,1
18446,Penny,14," Okay, it's not a movie. It's improv. So no one calls action.",4,Big Bang Theory,61,12
18447,Sheldon,14," Hey, you taught me something. Who would have thought it?",4,Big Bang Theory,57,10
18448,Penny,14," Okay. Uh, no, the shipment has not arrived, and I really need those shoes. They are my biggest seller. Yes, ladies sizes six through ten. Thank you. Oh, sorry, I have to go, I have a customer. Bye-bye. Hi. Can I help you?",4,Big Bang Theory,222,43
18449,Sheldon,14," I'd like a frozen yogurt, please.",4,Big Bang Theory,34,6
18450,Penny,14, Yogurt?,4,Big Bang Theory,8,1
18451,Sheldon,14, Yeah.,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
18452,Penny,14," Um, okay, sure. Luckily, we sell both shoes and yogurt here.",4,Big Bang Theory,61,11
18453,Sheldon,14, You do?,4,Big Bang Theory,8,2
18454,Penny,14," Yes. Look up at the sign, and remember, improv is always about saying yes.",4,Big Bang Theory,75,14
18455,Sheldon,14, All right. Yes. I see a sign. It says Camarillo State Mental Hospital.,4,Big Bang Theory,71,13
18456,Penny,14, What?,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
18457,Sheldon,14, It's the only explanation I can come up with for why you think you sell shoes and yogurt.,4,Big Bang Theory,90,18
18458,Penny,14," Okay, you know what? Let's just try a different improv. Uh, oh, this time we will be two winos living under a freeway overpass.",4,Big Bang Theory,128,24
18459,Sheldon,14," Oh, and we're going to use props?",4,Big Bang Theory,34,7
18460,Penny,14," You bet. I had dreams, you know. I was gonna be famous. Show everybody back home I could be someone. Now look at me. Want some?",4,Big Bang Theory,128,26
18461,Sheldon,14, You have any frozen yogurt?,4,Big Bang Theory,28,5
18463,Leonard,14, I'm still not adjusted to how the SyFy channel spells their name now. S-Y-F-Y. That's siffy.,4,Big Bang Theory,93,16
18464,Raj,14, Uh-huh.,4,Big Bang Theory,8,1
18465,Leonard,14," Hello? Oh, my God! Is he okay?",4,Big Bang Theory,31,7
18466,Raj,14, What happened?,4,Big Bang Theory,15,2
18467,Leonard,14," Hang on. Hang on. Uh-huh. Okay, thank you. Howard was on his scooter, and got hit by a truck. He's in critical condition.",4,Big Bang Theory,122,23
18468,Raj,14," Oh, no!",4,Big Bang Theory,8,2
18470,Leonard,14, Have you seen him?,4,Big Bang Theory,19,4
18472,Leonard,14, It'll be okay. It'll be okay.,4,Big Bang Theory,30,6
18473,Raj,14," It'll be okay. It'll be okay.  It's Howard. Howard, hello.",4,Big Bang Theory,59,10
18474,Howard,14," Raj, is that you?",4,Big Bang Theory,18,4
18475,Raj,14," Yeah, I'm right here, buddy. How are you?",4,Big Bang Theory,42,8
18476,Howard,14," Shh, shh. Listen to me. I'm not gonna make it.",4,Big Bang Theory,47,10
18477,Raj,14," No, no, no, don't say that. You're going to be all right.",4,Big Bang Theory,58,12
18478,Howard,14," Raj, I don't have time. Now, pay attention. My last wish is that you look after Bernadette.",4,Big Bang Theory,92,17
18479,Raj,14," Of course, of course. Now when you say look after, you mean",4,Big Bang Theory,60,12
18481,Raj,14," Excuse me, Bernadette. I have to hear it from him.",4,Big Bang Theory,51,10
18482,Howard,14, Sexually.,4,Big Bang Theory,10,1
18483,Raj,14," Got it. Take care. I guess I have no choice but to make sweet, guilt-free love to you over and over again for the rest of my life.",4,Big Bang Theory,131,28
18485,Leonard,14, Or it could be sy-fee.,4,Big Bang Theory,23,5
18486,Raj,14, What?,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
18487,Leonard,14, S-Y-F-Y. Sy-fee.,4,Big Bang Theory,17,2
18488,Raj,14," Oh, right. Good one.",4,Big Bang Theory,21,4
18490,Penny,14," So, did you get a chance to go over the scene I gave you?",4,Big Bang Theory,58,14
18491,Sheldon,14, Yes. I didn't care for it.,4,Big Bang Theory,27,6
18492,Penny,14," Okay, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is an American classic.",4,Big Bang Theory,52,11
18493,Sheldon,14," So is the McRib sandwich. I don't care for that, either.",4,Big Bang Theory,57,11
18494,Penny,14, Fine. What would you rather do as a scene study?,4,Big Bang Theory,49,10
18495,Sheldon,14, I'm glad you asked. I took the liberty of adapting a Star Trek fan fiction novella I wrote when I was ten into a one-act play.,4,Big Bang Theory,127,26
18496,Penny,14, And you think it's better than Tennessee Williams?,4,Big Bang Theory,51,8
18497,Sheldon,14, Why don't we leave that for future generations to decide?,4,Big Bang Theory,58,10
18498,Penny,14, Where No Sheldon Has Gone Before.,4,Big Bang Theory,34,6
18499,Sheldon,14," It's the story of a young boy who is transported from the ignorant backwoods of East Texas to the 23rd Century, where his genius is not only appreciated, but celebrated.",4,Big Bang Theory,170,30
18500,Penny,14, KMN.,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
18501,Sheldon,14," Now, in this pivotal scene, Sheldon's mother, played by you, argues with an emissary of the United Federation of Planets, Mr. Spock, the role I will bring to life.",4,Big Bang Theory,164,29
18502,Penny,14," Okay, that's fine, but let's try and get you out of your comfort zone.",4,Big Bang Theory,71,14
18503,Sheldon,14, Why would we want to do that? It's called the comfort zone for a reason.,4,Big Bang Theory,73,15
18504,Penny,14," Okay, the whole point of this is to loosen you up a little, so I'm thinking you'll play the role of your mother, and I will bring life to Mr. Spock.",4,Big Bang Theory,149,31
18505,Sheldon,14, I'm sorry. You'll be Spock?,4,Big Bang Theory,28,5
18506,Penny,14, It's only logical.,4,Big Bang Theory,19,3
18507,Sheldon,14, Very well. I'll set the scene.,4,Big Bang Theory,31,6
18508,Penny,14, All right.,4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
18509,Sheldon,14," East Texas. A warm summer night. A woman, Mary, stands on a porch. In the distance, we hear a lonesome train whistle. Woo-woo. The droning buzz of cicadas. Zzzzzzzzz. A coyote howls at the moon, frightening sensitive young boys everywhere. Aw-aw-aw! Out in the woods, an owl screeches.",4,Big Bang Theory,286,48
18510,Penny,14," Okay, okay. We get it. You set the scene.",4,Big Bang Theory,42,9
18511,Sheldon,14, Hoo!,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
18512,Penny,14, Now just read your mother's line.,4,Big Bang Theory,34,6
18513,Sheldon,14," Shelly! Shelly, how many times have I told you not to leave your sciencey stuff out on the porch? Goodness, I'll never understand that boy. But then again, I'm a religious nut, and my mind is closed to so many things.",4,Big Bang Theory,218,41
18514,Penny,14, Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo. Spock to Enterprise. Transport successful.,4,Big Bang Theory,68,6
18515,Sheldon,14," Glory be to Heaven, some sort of creature just manifested out of thin air. George, put down that Pepsi can full of bourbon that ain't foolin' no one, and get your shotgun!",4,Big Bang Theory,172,32
18516,Penny,14," Greetings, Mary Cooper. I am Spock.",4,Big Bang Theory,36,6
18517,Sheldon,14, I'm sorry. I just don't buy it.,4,Big Bang Theory,32,7
18518,Penny,14, Just keep going!,4,Big Bang Theory,17,3
18519,Sheldon,14," Oh, my, your sudden appearance startles me.",4,Big Bang Theory,44,7
18520,Penny,14," We have been monitoring your son Sheldon from the 23rd Century, and we have determined that he is now ready to join us. His unique genius is our best hope for bringing peace to a vast and troubled galaxy.",4,Big Bang Theory,205,39
18521,Sheldon,14," I understand. Oh, Shelly? A man's here to take you away to the future! Be sure to pack clean underwear.â€ù",4,Big Bang Theory,107,20
18522,Penny,14," Okay, okay, let's try that last line again, and this time, maybe try choking up a little.",4,Big Bang Theory,90,17
18523,Sheldon,14, Why?,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
18524,Penny,14," Well, you're losing your son.",4,Big Bang Theory,30,5
18525,Sheldon,14," Yes, but he's going to a better place where he won't get beat up. So much.",4,Big Bang Theory,75,16
18526,Penny,14," All right, come on, just try it my way. Pretend you're sad to see him go. I'm gonna lead you in. His unique genius is our best hope for bringing peace to a vast and troubled galaxy. That's your cue.",4,Big Bang Theory,199,40
18527,Sheldon,14, I'm sorry. I just love that line. Even the way you do it.,4,Big Bang Theory,58,13
18528,Penny,14," All right, come on, come on. Put some real emotion into it. Blah-blah, blah, blah, vast and troubled galaxy. Go.",4,Big Bang Theory,113,20
18529,Sheldon,14," Oh, Shelly? A man's here to take you away to the future. Be sure to pack clean underwear.",4,Big Bang Theory,90,18
18530,Penny,14, That's good. That's good. That's good.,4,Big Bang Theory,39,6
18531,Sheldon,14," Mommy, why are you crying? â€˜Cause I'm gonna miss you, Shelly-bean, even though you creep the bejeezus out of me.",4,Big Bang Theory,115,20
18532,Penny,14," Okay, I guess we're improvising now.",4,Big Bang Theory,37,6
18533,Sheldon,14," Well I'm sorry. It's not my fault. I'm just incredibly smart, and everyone around here is dumber than a bag of rocks. Oh, now, don't you start crying. You get in that spaceship. Mommy's late for Indian bingo.",4,Big Bang Theory,209,38
18534,Penny,14," Mrs. Cooper, hey, it's Penny. Yeah, I think I broke your son. Hey, hold on. Talk to your mother.",4,Big Bang Theory,97,19
18535,Sheldon,14," Mommy, I love you. Don't let Spock take me to the future!",4,Big Bang Theory,58,12
18538,Raj,14, Like the wild elephant I am trumpeting my love for you!,4,Big Bang Theory,56,11
18540,Raj,14, My heart burns for you like the sun at noon!,4,Big Bang Theory,45,10
18542,Raj,14, You are my heart!,4,Big Bang Theory,18,4
18544,Raj,14, You are my heart!,4,Big Bang Theory,18,4
18548,Raj,14," Dance number aside, I'm so not gay.",4,Big Bang Theory,36,7
18550,Raj,15," Here's what I wonder about zombies.  What happens if they can't get any human flesh to eat? They can't starve to death, they're already dead.",4,Big Bang Theory,142,25
18551,Howard,15, You take this one. I spent an hour last night on how do vampires shave when they can't see themselves in the mirror?,4,Big Bang Theory,117,23
18552,Sheldon,15, Well-groomed vampires meet in pairs and shave each other. Case closed.,4,Big Bang Theory,71,11
18553,Raj,15," Yeah, okay, so, zombies.",4,Big Bang Theory,25,4
18554,Leonard,15," I guess it depends on the zombies, Raj. Are we talking slow zombies, fast zombies? Like, in 28 Days, if those zombies didn't eat, they starved.",4,Big Bang Theory,144,26
18555,Howard,15, You're thinking of 28 Days Later. 28 Days is where Sandra Bullock goes to rehab and puts the audience into an undead state,4,Big Bang Theory,123,23
18556,Raj,15," Hey, don't bag on Sandra Bullock! You think it makes you look cultured, but you just come off as bitter.",4,Big Bang Theory,105,20
18557,Leonard,15," Oh, Dr. Siebert, twelve o'clock.",4,Big Bang Theory,33,5
18558,Howard,15, Why's the president of the university slumming in the cafeteria?,4,Big Bang Theory,65,10
18559,Sheldon,15," Perhaps he's emulating Shakespeare's Henry V, who dressed as a commoner and mingled among them, to find out how he was being perceived by his subjects. Course, if he'd have read any of the thirteen hundred e-mails I've sent him on the subject of his administration, he could have saved himself the trouble.",4,Big Bang Theory,307,53
18560,Raj,15, Or maybe he heard it's Tator Tot Tuesday. That's why I'm here.,4,Big Bang Theory,63,12
18562,Sheldon,15," That depends, how much longer do you plan on fondling my shoulder?",4,Big Bang Theory,67,12
18564,Sheldon,15," It's not a touch phobia, it's a germ phobia. If you'd like to go put on a pair of latex gloves,",4,Big Bang Theory,96,21
18566,Raj,15, Sounds great!,4,Big Bang Theory,14,2
18567,Howard,15, I'm in!,4,Big Bang Theory,8,2
18568,Sheldon,15," Hold on. Just because the nice man is offering you candy, doesn't mean you should jump into his windowless van. What's the occasion?",4,Big Bang Theory,133,23
18570,Sheldon,15, Aha! The tear-stained air mattress in the back of the van.,4,Big Bang Theory,59,11
18572,Sheldon,15," I don't care, it's demeaning. And I refuse to be trotted out and shown off like a prize hog at the Texas State Fair. Which, by the way, is something you don't want to attend wearing a Star Trek ensign's uniform.",4,Big Bang Theory,212,41
18574,Raj,15," Oh, you don't want that.",4,Big Bang Theory,25,5
18576,Sheldon,15, Ugh!,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
18578,Raj,15," Oh, boy! Tator tots and a party invitation? What a great day!",4,Big Bang Theory,62,12
18580,Penny,15, There you go.,4,Big Bang Theory,14,3
18581,Leonard,15, Are you sure this is right?,4,Big Bang Theory,28,6
18582,Penny,15," Yeah, just tuck that part in your pants; you'll be fine.",4,Big Bang Theory,57,11
18583,Howard,15," Okay, let's go smooch some rich, wrinkled tuckus.",4,Big Bang Theory,50,8
18584,Penny,15," Oh, Howard, I can't believe Bernadette let you go to a fancy party wearing a dickey.",4,Big Bang Theory,85,16
18585,Howard,15," Excuse me, my girlfriend doesn't pick out my clothes. My mother does.",4,Big Bang Theory,70,12
18586,Leonard,15, Oh. We should get going.,4,Big Bang Theory,25,5
18587,Howard,15, What about Sheldon?,4,Big Bang Theory,20,3
18588,Sheldon,15, Sheldon is not going.,4,Big Bang Theory,22,4
18589,Leonard,15, Really? What do we tell Siebert?,4,Big Bang Theory,33,6
18590,Sheldon,15, Tell him Dr. Cooper feels that the best use of his time is to employ his rare and precious mental faculties to tear the mask off nature and stare at the face of God.,4,Big Bang Theory,166,34
18591,Penny,15," Sheldon, it's Saturday night, you'll be doing laundry.",4,Big Bang Theory,55,8
18592,Sheldon,15," Don't tell him that, tell him the mask thing.",4,Big Bang Theory,46,9
18594,Howard,15," Hey, put your tie back in your pants.",4,Big Bang Theory,38,8
18595,Leonard,15, Thanks.,4,Big Bang Theory,8,1
18596,Raj,15, Nice place. Reminds me of my parents' house back in New Delhi.,4,Big Bang Theory,63,12
18597,Howard,15, You're kidding.,4,Big Bang Theory,16,2
18598,Raj,15," No. We are very wealthy. But the only difference is, we have more servants.",4,Big Bang Theory,76,14
18599,Leonard,15, More than this?,4,Big Bang Theory,16,3
18600,Raj,15," More than we can use. You see, in India, we don't make the mistake of letting our poor people have dreams.",4,Big Bang Theory,107,21
18602,Leonard,15, He's tearing the mask off nature to look at the face of God.,4,Big Bang Theory,61,13
18604,Raj,15, I think we were misled about the cute girls.,4,Big Bang Theory,45,9
18607,Howard,15, I'm an engineer. Most engineers don't bother with a PhD. But you may be interested to know I designed the zero-gravity waste-disposal system for NASA.,4,Big Bang Theory,151,25
18609,Howard,15, I'm gonna go hit the bar.,4,Big Bang Theory,26,6
18611,Raj,15, Do him first.,4,Big Bang Theory,14,3
18614,Leonard,15, Uh.. b.. d.. uh.. uh..,4,Big Bang Theory,23,5
18616,Leonard,15, Coffee maker?,4,Big Bang Theory,14,2
18618,Raj,15, It's Koothrappali. I have to tinkle.,4,Big Bang Theory,37,6
18620,Sheldon,15," And so, instead of bowing to pressure, and going to that pointless soiree, I stayed right here and did a load of whites.",4,Big Bang Theory,121,23
18621,Amy,15," Well, normally I respect your macho rebellious attitude toward The Man, but, in this case, I think you've made a foolish mistake.",4,Big Bang Theory,130,22
18622,Sheldon,15," Unlikely. But make your case. Keeping in mind that your critical attitude is ruining our Saturday night together, and I'm not above minimizing your window.",4,Big Bang Theory,156,25
18623,Amy,15," Sheldon, like it or not, until you manage to upload your intelligence into a self-sustaining orbiting satellite, equipped with high-speed Internet and a cloaking device, you will be dependent on other members of the human race.",4,Big Bang Theory,228,36
18624,Sheldon,15, That's it. Prepare to be minimized.,4,Big Bang Theory,36,6
18625,Amy,15," I'm not finished. All scientists have to fund-raise, Sheldon. How do you think I paid for my lab?",4,Big Bang Theory,98,18
18626,Sheldon,15, Your lab is funded by some Middle-Eastern dilettante?,4,Big Bang Theory,54,8
18627,Amy,15," Technically, Faisal is my fiance. But I do have a state-of-the-art two-photon microscope and a place to stay in Riyadh for the winter.",4,Big Bang Theory,135,23
18628,Sheldon,15," Well, that explains those puzzling camel race photos on your Facebook page.",4,Big Bang Theory,76,12
18629,Amy,15," And consider this, without you to make the case for the physics department, the task will fall to people like Leonard and Rajesh.",4,Big Bang Theory,130,23
18630,Sheldon,15, Are you trying to scare me? â€˜Cause you're succeeding.,4,Big Bang Theory,56,9
18631,Amy,15," Well, then prepare to be terrified. If your friends are unconvincing, this year's donations might go to, say, the geology department.",4,Big Bang Theory,134,21
18632,Sheldon,15," Oh, dear,not, not the dirt people!",4,Big Bang Theory,35,6
18633,Amy,15," Or worse, it could go to the liberal arts.",4,Big Bang Theory,43,9
18634,Sheldon,15, No!,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
18635,Amy,15," Millions of dollars being showered on poets, literary theorists and students of gender studies.",4,Big Bang Theory,96,14
18636,Sheldon,15," Oh, the humanities!",4,Big Bang Theory,20,3
18638,Leonard,15," On the bright side, I don't think President Siebert will be making us go to any more fund-raisers.",4,Big Bang Theory,99,18
18639,Howard,15," It was so much easier at my bar mitzvah. The old people just came up to you, pinched your cheek and handed you a savings bond.",4,Big Bang Theory,127,26
18640,Raj,15," Oh, don't be such gloomy Gusses. Look at the size of these shrimp! At what point do we start calling them lobsters?",4,Big Bang Theory,116,22
18641,Leonard,15," Face it, Raj, we crashed and burned tonight.",4,Big Bang Theory,45,8
18643,Leonard,15," Mrs. Latham, the first machine I turn on in the morning is the helium-neon laser, 'cause it needs to warm up.",4,Big Bang Theory,110,21
18645,Leonard,15, You're kidding. That was good for you? â€˜Cause I was sweating through my T-shirt.,4,Big Bang Theory,83,14
18647,Leonard,15, Why?,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
18649,Sheldon,15," No, no, no, I'm just here for your money. I don't want to shake anyone's germy hands. Explain it to them, Siebert.",4,Big Bang Theory,115,22
18651,Sheldon,15," I must confess I don't understand you, President Siebert. First you say you want me to appear at your fund-raisers, but now you say you never want me to go anywhere near your fund-raisers. Forgive me, but that sounds like a mixed message. Here we go again. If there's simply no talking to me, why did you call? I'm sorry, someone's on the other line. Why don't you see if you can organize your thoughts, and we'll try again later. Cooper-Hofstadter residence. Go for Cooper.",4,Big Bang Theory,475,85
18652,Leonard,15," Hello, Mrs. Latham. Yes, I live with him. I don't, I, I really don't know why. Tonight? Sure, that'd be great. Okay, I'll, I'll see you then. Bye. She wants to have dinner and talk about my research.",4,Big Bang Theory,200,38
18653,Sheldon,15," An entire dinner to talk about your research? Where you going, the drive-thru at Jack in the Box?",4,Big Bang Theory,98,18
18654,Leonard,15," Well, wherever we're going, she's sending a car to pick me up.",4,Big Bang Theory,63,12
18655,Sheldon,15," Okay, I see what's happening.",4,Big Bang Theory,30,5
18656,Leonard,15, What?,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
18657,Sheldon,15," My stature intimidates her, so she's using you to get to me. Crafty old gal.",4,Big Bang Theory,77,15
18658,Leonard,15," Excuse me, but you are not the only distinguished scientist in this apartment. I've been published in peer-reviewed journals, I received a Dissertation of the Year award for experimental particle physics.",4,Big Bang Theory,205,31
18659,Sheldon,15," No, that can't be it. And since you seem to have forgotten, the reason we live together is we're best friends. And I got your back, Jack.",4,Big Bang Theory,138,27
18661,Leonard,15, That was a great meal.,4,Big Bang Theory,23,5
18663,Leonard,15, The only time I eat this well is when my mom's in town and she takes me out to dinner.,4,Big Bang Theory,87,20
18665,Leonard,15," You kind of remind me of her. She enjoys making people uncomfortable, too.",4,Big Bang Theory,75,13
18667,Leonard,15, No kidding.,4,Big Bang Theory,12,2
18669,Leonard,15," Yeah, um, so, hey, speaking of money, how are you feeling about helping the physics department get a cryogenic centrifugal pump and molecular sieve?",4,Big Bang Theory,149,24
18671,Leonard,15," Oh, good, good.",4,Big Bang Theory,16,3
18673,Leonard,15," Terrific. Great. What level is that?  Okay, now you don't remind me of my mom.",4,Big Bang Theory,79,15
18675,Sheldon,15," I'm sorry, so, eventually, zombies are going to attack the rehab facility where Sandra Bullock is?",4,Big Bang Theory,99,16
18676,Penny,15," Yes, Sheldon. Keep watching.",4,Big Bang Theory,29,4
18677,Sheldon,15," You know, it's a shame, all that work she's doing to get sober, only to be torn apart and eaten alive.",4,Big Bang Theory,103,21
18678,Howard,15, Hey. How was dinner?,4,Big Bang Theory,21,4
18679,Leonard,15, Swell. I need a drink. Do we have any alcohol?,4,Big Bang Theory,47,10
18680,Sheldon,15," No. But we have potatoes, I could make you vodka. It'll take two weeks.",4,Big Bang Theory,72,14
18681,Penny,15," Leonard, are you okay?",4,Big Bang Theory,23,4
18682,Leonard,15," Um, I'm not sure.",4,Big Bang Theory,18,4
18683,Howard,15, What's going on?,4,Big Bang Theory,17,3
18684,Leonard,15," Well, Mrs. Latham said she was seriously considering donating money so we could get a cryogenic centrifugal pump.",4,Big Bang Theory,114,18
18685,Sheldon,15," Oh, wow!",4,Big Bang Theory,9,2
18686,Howard,15, Yes!,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
18687,Leonard,15, Then she stuck her tongue down my throat.,4,Big Bang Theory,42,8
18688,Sheldon,15, Why?,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
18689,Penny,15," Okay, we can't keep explaining everything. Read that book we got you.",4,Big Bang Theory,70,12
18690,Leonard,15, She hit on me.,4,Big Bang Theory,15,4
18691,Howard,15, Wait-wait-wait. Are you telling us that old lady wanted to have sex with you in exchange for giving your department millions of dollars?,4,Big Bang Theory,137,23
18692,Leonard,15, I think so.,4,Big Bang Theory,12,3
18693,Howard,15, You lucky duck.,4,Big Bang Theory,16,3
18694,Penny,15," You're really a broken toy, aren't you?",4,Big Bang Theory,40,7
18695,Leonard,15," I was able to get out of there before anything else happened, but she wants to see me again tomorrow night.",4,Big Bang Theory,108,21
18696,Sheldon,15, Excellent! What are you planning to wear?,4,Big Bang Theory,42,7
18697,Leonard,15, What?,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
18698,Sheldon,15," Penny, you're an expert on trading sexual favours for material gain, walk him through this.",4,Big Bang Theory,92,15
18699,Leonard,15," Well, n-no, hold on a second, I'm not going to sleep with her.",4,Big Bang Theory,63,13
18700,Sheldon,15, But we need a cryogenic centrifugal pump.,4,Big Bang Theory,42,7
18701,Leonard,15," Well, forget it! It's not gonna happen.",4,Big Bang Theory,40,7
18702,Sheldon,15," Well, come now, Leonard, this may be your only chance to make a real contribution to science!",4,Big Bang Theory,94,17
18703,Leonard,15," I repeat, not gonna happen.",4,Big Bang Theory,28,5
18704,Penny,15, What was all that about me trading sexual favours for material gain?,4,Big Bang Theory,69,12
18705,Sheldon,15, It was a compliment. I believe in giving credit where credit is due.,4,Big Bang Theory,69,13
18707,Sheldon,15," Okay, fine. I'll tell him. Leonard, Mrs. Latham's car is here for you.",4,Big Bang Theory,71,13
18708,Leonard,15, I won't be too late. I'm just gonna make a final pitch for the funding and then say good night.,4,Big Bang Theory,96,20
18709,Sheldon,15," Hold on, I have something for you.",4,Big Bang Theory,35,7
18710,Leonard,15, What's this?,4,Big Bang Theory,13,2
18711,Sheldon,15," Just a few things you may need tonight. There's, uh, baby oil, condoms and, uh, a little something I procured from the school of pharmacology. They say it is to Viagra as Viagra is to a green M&M.",4,Big Bang Theory,197,38
18712,Leonard,15, I am not going to have sex with her.,4,Big Bang Theory,37,9
18713,Sheldon,15, Maybe this will overcome your reluctance. I went on the Internet and found a photograph of a 25-year-old Mrs. Latham to get your libido humming. Check out those saddle shoes. Rar!,4,Big Bang Theory,180,31
18714,Leonard,15, Are you insane? I'm not going to prostitute myself just so we can get some new equipment.,4,Big Bang Theory,90,17
18715,Sheldon,15," Oh, come on! Why not?",4,Big Bang Theory,22,5
18716,Leonard,15," Good night, Sheldon.",4,Big Bang Theory,21,3
18717,Sheldon,15," Given how much time you spend engaging in pointless self-abuse, you might consider, just this once, using your genitalia to actually accomplish something!",4,Big Bang Theory,155,23
18718,Penny,15," He still won't shag the old lady, huh?",4,Big Bang Theory,39,8
18719,Sheldon,15, No. But thank you for asking.,4,Big Bang Theory,30,6
18721,Leonard,15, Hey. Hi.,4,Big Bang Theory,9,2
18723,Leonard,15," I'm very hungry. For food, right?",4,Big Bang Theory,34,6
18725,Leonard,15," No, that's okay.",4,Big Bang Theory,17,3
18727,Leonard,15, Really?,4,Big Bang Theory,8,1
18729,Leonard,15, Oh. Then what was last night about?,4,Big Bang Theory,36,7
18731,Leonard,15, Oh.,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
18733,Leonard,15, Thank you.,4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
18735,Leonard,15," Oh, don't say that. You're a very attractive woman.",4,Big Bang Theory,52,9
18737,Leonard,15," No, it's true.",4,Big Bang Theory,15,3
18739,Leonard,15," I'm sure I would. But why, why, exactly?",4,Big Bang Theory,41,8
18741,Leonard,15, I hadn't really given it much thought.,4,Big Bang Theory,39,7
18743,Leonard,15, Do you mean?,4,Big Bang Theory,13,3
18745,Leonard,15," Oh, what the hell.",4,Big Bang Theory,19,4
18747,Penny,15," Good morning, slut.",4,Big Bang Theory,20,3
18748,Leonard,15, What?,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
18749,Penny,15," Oh, please, I recognize the walk of shame when I see it. All you're missing is a little smeared mascara and a purse with panties wadded up in it.",4,Big Bang Theory,146,29
18750,Sheldon,15, What's going on?,4,Big Bang Theory,17,3
18751,Leonard,15," Oh, nothing's going on. Excuse me.",4,Big Bang Theory,35,6
18752,Sheldon,15, Are you just getting home?,4,Big Bang Theory,27,5
18753,Leonard,15, Yeah.,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
18754,Sheldon,15," That's a good sign, right?",4,Big Bang Theory,27,5
18755,Penny,15," Oh, yeah.",4,Big Bang Theory,10,2
18756,Sheldon,15, I'm so proud of you! You sold yourself out like a common streetwalker!,4,Big Bang Theory,71,13
18757,Leonard,15," No, I didn't do it for the money.",4,Big Bang Theory,34,8
18758,Sheldon,15, She stiffed you?,4,Big Bang Theory,17,3
18759,Penny,15, I believe that's what your roommate did to her.,4,Big Bang Theory,48,9
18760,Sheldon,15, What?,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
18761,Penny,15," Again, read the book we gave you.",4,Big Bang Theory,34,7
18762,Leonard,15," No, I mean, I, I, I got the money first.",4,Big Bang Theory,41,10
18763,Sheldon,15," Smart. Get paid up front. Yeah, I think you have a real knack for gigolo work, Leonard.",4,Big Bang Theory,88,17
18764,Leonard,15," Uh, I'm gonna go lie down.",4,Big Bang Theory,27,6
18765,Sheldon,15," That's a good idea, get your rest. There are a lot more rich old ladies out there, and Daddy needs a new linear accelerator. And I thought he didn't learn anything from his relationship with you.",4,Big Bang Theory,196,36
18766,Penny,15, Hey!,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
18767,Sheldon,15, Another compliment! Learn to recognize them.,4,Big Bang Theory,45,6
18770,Leonard,15, I didn't do it for the money!,4,Big Bang Theory,30,7
18772,Raj,15," Cool, buddy! That's awesome!",4,Big Bang Theory,29,4
18773,Howard,15, How was she?,4,Big Bang Theory,13,3
18775,Howard,16, What's so funny?,4,Big Bang Theory,17,3
18777,Howard,16," I do sometimes get a bit carried away, don't I?",4,Big Bang Theory,48,10
18779,Howard,16, You know it's meant as a compliment.,4,Big Bang Theory,37,7
18781,Howard,16, This is perfect. I hope this moment never ends.,4,Big Bang Theory,48,9
18783,Howard,16," Well, gotta go.",4,Big Bang Theory,16,3
18785,Howard,16," Well, I'd love to, but you know my mother needs me in the morning.",4,Big Bang Theory,67,14
18787,Howard,16," It's not just the wig. It's pinning her hair up, drawing on her eyebrows. It's a two-person job.",4,Big Bang Theory,97,18
18789,Howard,16," Oh, honey, I'm sorry. What can I do?",4,Big Bang Theory,37,8
18791,Howard,16," Okay. Like, what, another five, ten minutes?",4,Big Bang Theory,45,7
18793,Howard,16, Your call.,4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
18795,Howard,16," Boy, I don't know. You, me, Ma living under the same roof?",4,Big Bang Theory,59,12
18797,Howard,16, I've got a better solution.,4,Big Bang Theory,28,5
18799,Howard,16," We wait for my mom's heart to explode from all the salt she eats. Then we just stick her in the ground, flip her mattress and move into the big bedroom.",4,Big Bang Theory,153,31
18801,Howard,16, Look at us planning a future together.,4,Big Bang Theory,39,7
18804,Howard,16," Sex criminals don't have keys, Ma.",4,Big Bang Theory,35,6
18806,Howard,16, I was out with Bernadette.,4,Big Bang Theory,27,5
18808,Howard,16," I'm not having this conversation with you, Ma!",4,Big Bang Theory,47,8
18810,Howard,16, Nobody has a disease!,4,Big Bang Theory,22,4
18812,Howard,16, That's it. I don't have to take this. Good luck with your eyebrows in the morning!,4,Big Bang Theory,83,16
18814,Howard,16, I'm still leaving! I just forgot my Claritin.,4,Big Bang Theory,46,8
18816,Leonard,16," Hey, what's up?",4,Big Bang Theory,16,3
18817,Howard,16, I need a place to crash.,4,Big Bang Theory,25,6
18818,Leonard,16," Uh, sure. Why?",4,Big Bang Theory,15,3
18819,Howard,16, Big fight with my mother.,4,Big Bang Theory,26,5
18820,Leonard,16, Still arguing over which CSI is the best?,4,Big Bang Theory,42,8
18821,Howard,16," No, we agreed they all have their merits. This was about Bernadette.",4,Big Bang Theory,69,12
18822,Sheldon,16, What's going on?,4,Big Bang Theory,17,3
18823,Leonard,16, Howard's gonna sleep here tonight. He had a fight with his mother.,4,Big Bang Theory,67,12
18824,Sheldon,16, Did you offer him a hot beverage?,4,Big Bang Theory,34,7
18825,Leonard,16, No.,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
18826,Sheldon,16," Leonard, social protocol states when a friend is upset, you offer them a hot beverage, such as tea.",4,Big Bang Theory,100,18
18827,Howard,16, Tea does sound nice.,4,Big Bang Theory,21,4
18828,Sheldon,16," You heard the man, Leonard. And while you're at it, I'm upset that we have an unannounced houseguest, so make me cocoa. Point of inquiry, given that Leonard is your secondary friend and Koothrappali is your primary friend, why didn't you seek refuge under his roof?",4,Big Bang Theory,266,46
18829,Howard,16, There's no room. His sister is staying with him.,4,Big Bang Theory,49,9
18830,Leonard,16," Wait, wait. What?",4,Big Bang Theory,18,3
18831,Sheldon,16," Cocoa, Leonard. Focus. I'm down in the dumps here.",4,Big Bang Theory,51,9
18832,Leonard,16, Priya's in town?,4,Big Bang Theory,17,3
18833,Howard,16," Yeah, some work thing. Anyway, my mother seems to think that Bernadette",4,Big Bang Theory,72,12
18834,Leonard,16, Hold on. When did Priya get here?,4,Big Bang Theory,34,7
18835,Howard,16," I don't know. A couple of days ago. The thing is, Bernadette doesn't like that I have to take care of my mother, and my mother doesn't trust Bernadette.",4,Big Bang Theory,153,29
18836,Leonard,16," Yeah, that's a real pickle. Bye.",4,Big Bang Theory,33,6
18837,Sheldon,16," Don't worry. As your tertiary friend, I am prepared to step in and comfort you.",4,Big Bang Theory,80,15
18838,Howard,16, That's not really necessary.,4,Big Bang Theory,29,4
18839,Sheldon,16," No, no. I'll finish making the tea, while you narcissistically ramble on about whatever's troubling you.",4,Big Bang Theory,105,16
18840,Howard,16, Thanks.,4,Big Bang Theory,8,1
18841,Sheldon,16, That's what tertiary friends are for.,4,Big Bang Theory,38,6
18843,Raj,16, Who is it?,4,Big Bang Theory,11,3
18844,Leonard,16, It's Leonard.,4,Big Bang Theory,14,2
18845,Raj,16, You can't come in.,4,Big Bang Theory,19,4
18846,Leonard,16, I just want to talk to her.,4,Big Bang Theory,28,7
18847,Raj,16, I forbid it.,4,Big Bang Theory,13,3
18849,Raj,16, You heard me. I forbidded it.,4,Big Bang Theory,30,6
18851,Raj,16, Forbaded it?,4,Big Bang Theory,13,2
18853,Leonard,16, What are you doing here?,4,Big Bang Theory,25,5
18855,Leonard,16, Why didn't you call?,4,Big Bang Theory,21,4
18856,Raj,16," Clearly, she was sending you a message to take a hike, Mike.",4,Big Bang Theory,61,12
18858,Leonard,16, I know. Last time I came on too strong. Can we talk in private?,4,Big Bang Theory,64,14
18859,Raj,16, No!,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
18861,Raj,16," It's completely inappropriate for a single woman to entertain a man in private. If you insist on talking, you must do it on the couch! All right, you may talk in the bedroom, but I want this door to remain open! All right, just this once you may close the door. But keep in mind I'll be right out here monitoring the situation!  Oh, damn it. Leonard, when you get this message, call me.  Priya, this is your brother. When you get this, tell Leonard to check his voicemail.",4,Big Bang Theory,473,89
18863,Sheldon,16, Would you be sleeping over again this evening? Because you're welcome to.,4,Big Bang Theory,74,12
18864,Howard,16," That's very nice of you, but I made other plans.",4,Big Bang Theory,49,10
18865,Sheldon,16," Well, just keep in mind that should you ever need a slightly apathetic tertiary friend, I stand at the ready.",4,Big Bang Theory,110,20
18867,Howard,16, Hey.,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
18868,Sheldon,16, Hello.,4,Big Bang Theory,7,1
18869,Raj,16, Why are you holding hands? I forbid you to hold hands.,4,Big Bang Theory,55,11
18871,Raj,16," Yeah, but you were just sleeping, because I forboded you to have sex.",4,Big Bang Theory,70,13
18872,Leonard,16, The word is forbade.,4,Big Bang Theory,21,4
18873,Raj,16, Are you sure? That doesn't sound right.,4,Big Bang Theory,40,7
18875,Sheldon,16," Actually, he can. The Hindu Code of Manu is very clear in these matters. If a woman's father is not around, the duty of controlling her base desires falls to the closest male member of her family, in this case, Raj. The code also states that if she disobeys, she will be reborn in the womb of a jackal and tormented by diseases. If true, that seems like an awfully large gamble given that the prize is Leonard.",4,Big Bang Theory,411,78
18876,Raj,16," There it is, Priya. We're Indian. We believe this stuff.",4,Big Bang Theory,57,10
18878,Raj,16," Some of it makes sense, some of it's crazy. My point is, you can't go out with Leonard.",4,Big Bang Theory,88,18
18879,Penny,16, Who can't go out with Leonard?,4,Big Bang Theory,31,6
18880,Raj,16, My sister.,4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
18881,Leonard,16," Penny, this is Raj's sister, Priya.",4,Big Bang Theory,36,6
18883,Penny,16," Oh, yeah, you, too.",4,Big Bang Theory,20,4
18884,Sheldon,16," Priya, if you're experiencing any tension or awkwardness, it may stem from the fact that Leonard and Penny used to, if I may quote Howard, do the dance with no pants.",4,Big Bang Theory,167,31
18885,Penny,16, Sheldon!,4,Big Bang Theory,9,1
18886,Leonard,16, Really?,4,Big Bang Theory,8,1
18887,Howard,16," Hey, Bernadette, can I talk to you for a second?",4,Big Bang Theory,49,10
18889,Raj,16," Penny, you became disenchanted with Leonard as a lover. Would you please tell my sister why?",4,Big Bang Theory,93,16
18890,Howard,16," Listen, my mom's going to Palm Springs to visit her sister. That's two whole nights in a row I can sleep over with you all the way to morning. Unless the desert air dries out her sinuses, in which case I'll have to schlep out there with the big humidifier.",4,Big Bang Theory,257,50
18892,Howard,16, Isn't that great?,4,Big Bang Theory,18,3
18894,Howard,16," Oh, uh",4,Big Bang Theory,7,2
18896,Howard,16," No, wait. You didn't let me finish.",4,Big Bang Theory,36,7
18898,Howard,16, Uh,4,Big Bang Theory,3,1
18901,Amy,16, I came as quickly as I could.,4,Big Bang Theory,30,7
18902,Penny,16, Okay. Why?,4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
18903,Amy,16," To comfort you, of course. Sheldon told me about Leonard dating Rajesh's sister. So I high-tailed it over here to pick up the pieces of your broken heart.",4,Big Bang Theory,155,28
18904,Penny,16," Amy, I'm fine.",4,Big Bang Theory,15,3
18905,Amy,16," You don't have to be strong for me. Now let's talk about Priya, that man-stealing bitch.",4,Big Bang Theory,89,16
18906,Penny,16, What?,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
18907,Amy,16," In situations like this, best girlfriends are often catty about the other woman. Rawr.",4,Big Bang Theory,87,14
18908,Penny,16," Really, I am not upset about Leonard and Priya.",4,Big Bang Theory,48,9
18909,Amy,16, Oh. Then perhaps you don't understand what's going on. Your former boyfriend has replaced you with what appears to be a very suitable mate. Arguably much more suitable than you.,4,Big Bang Theory,178,30
18910,Penny,16," Oh. Well, good for him. Hey, what do you mean, more suitable?",4,Big Bang Theory,62,12
18911,Amy,16," Well, granted, Penny, your secondary sexual characteristics are reasonably bodacious. But Priya is highly educated, she's an accomplished professional, and she comes from the culture that literally wrote the book on neat ways to have sex. Whereas you, on the other hand, are a community college dropout who comes from the culture that wrote the book on tipping cows.",4,Big Bang Theory,367,59
18912,Penny,16," Yeah. Okay, I got it. I got it. So, what is all that stuff?",4,Big Bang Theory,60,14
18913,Amy,16," This is a portable electroencephalogram. I'm doing research on emotions and brain activity. So when you start crying, I can see which region of the brain is activated. Then I'm going to stimulate the analogous area in the brain of a rhesus monkey and see if he cries. Cool, huh?",4,Big Bang Theory,279,50
18915,Howard,16, I choose you.,4,Big Bang Theory,14,3
18917,Howard,16, Yep. I moved out of my mother's house. Cord is cut. I'm all yours.,4,Big Bang Theory,67,14
18919,Howard,16, I don't know. She hasn't responded to my email yet.,4,Big Bang Theory,52,10
18921,Howard,16," I love you, too. So what's for dinner?",4,Big Bang Theory,39,8
18923,Howard,16, That's fine. Why don't we go fool around in our bedroom? And then you can go shopping.,4,Big Bang Theory,87,17
18925,Leonard,16," I thought maybe after we eat, we could see an early movie.",4,Big Bang Theory,59,12
18927,Leonard,16," I love the way you say, I'd love that.",4,Big Bang Theory,39,9
18928,Raj,16, She says it the same way I do. I'd love that. Everybody in India says it that way. It's not a big deal.,4,Big Bang Theory,104,23
18930,Raj,16," I'm not being a child. Leonard, I swear to God, if your sister ever comes to town, I shall have my way with her.",4,Big Bang Theory,113,24
18931,Leonard,16, My sister's 38 and married.,4,Big Bang Theory,28,5
18932,Raj,16, All the more shame that will fall upon the house of Hofstadter.,4,Big Bang Theory,64,12
18933,Penny,16," Ooh, I thought I smelled pizza.",4,Big Bang Theory,32,6
18934,Sheldon,16," That's remarkable. If pepperoni were an explosive substance, you could replace German shepherds at our nation's airports.",4,Big Bang Theory,122,17
18936,Penny,16," Oh, yes. Hi, hi. I'm sorry. I didn't know you had company. I don't want to impose.",4,Big Bang Theory,83,17
18937,Sheldon,16," No, no. It's not an imposition. At this point, in our ecosystem, you are akin to the plover, a small scavenging bird that eats extra food from between the teeth of crocodiles. Please, fly into our open maw, and have at it.",4,Big Bang Theory,223,42
18938,Penny,16," If I had more than a box of baking soda in my refrigerator, I wouldn't have to take that.",4,Big Bang Theory,90,19
18939,Amy,16," Hi, bestie.",4,Big Bang Theory,12,2
18940,Penny,16," Hi. So, um, Priya, you're a lawyer, right?",4,Big Bang Theory,43,8
18942,Leonard,16," Oh, come on. It's not boring at all. She's currently helping set up a secondary derivative market which would allow overseas car firms to hedge their investments against potential advancements in battery technology. Hmm?",4,Big Bang Theory,221,34
18944,Amy,16," So, how you holding up?",4,Big Bang Theory,24,5
18945,Penny,16, I'm fine.,4,Big Bang Theory,10,2
18946,Amy,16," Oh, who are you kidding? She's breathtaking.",4,Big Bang Theory,45,7
18948,Penny,16," Oh, yeah, yeah. It's real great. Today I drove to Van Nuys for an audition I thought was going to be for a cat food commercial. Turned out to be porn.",4,Big Bang Theory,151,31
18949,Sheldon,16, Did you get the part?,4,Big Bang Theory,22,5
18950,Penny,16, I didn't do the audition.,4,Big Bang Theory,26,5
18951,Sheldon,16," Given the state of your career, can you really afford to be picky?",4,Big Bang Theory,67,13
18953,Leonard,16," Oh, wow. I love Taming of the Shrew. I did a paper on it in high school. Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting? In his tail.",4,Big Bang Theory,134,30
18955,Leonard,16, Whose tongue?,4,Big Bang Theory,14,2
18957,Leonard,16," What, with my tongue in your tail?",4,Big Bang Theory,35,7
18958,Amy,16, I'm regretting my earlier cattiness. She is an absolute delight.,4,Big Bang Theory,65,10
18961,Howard,16," Wow, indeed.",4,Big Bang Theory,13,2
18963,Howard,16, Yeah. You know what would make this moment perfect?,4,Big Bang Theory,52,9
18965,Howard,16, A little snack. You got any string cheese?,4,Big Bang Theory,43,8
18967,Howard,16, Not as good. You can't make strings with it. Remind me to put it on your shopping list.,4,Big Bang Theory,88,18
18969,Howard,16, You have hypo-allergenic detergent?,4,Big Bang Theory,36,4
18971,Howard,16," Better put it on the list. If you wash my underwear with regular soap, I get little red bumps on my tuchus.",4,Big Bang Theory,108,22
18973,Howard,16," Well, honey, it's not gonna do itself. Oh, before I forget, tomorrow morning, you're driving me to the dentist.",4,Big Bang Theory,112,19
18975,Howard,16, You don't have to take me. You get to take me.,4,Big Bang Theory,47,11
18977,Howard,16, It's not weird. There's lots of kids there with their moms.,4,Big Bang Theory,60,11
18979,Howard,16," What? It's fun. If I have no cavities, afterwards, we go out for a treat.",4,Big Bang Theory,74,15
18981,Howard,16," Whoa, whoa, whoa! Where did that come from?",4,Big Bang Theory,44,8
18984,Howard,16," Nobody wants to do that to you, Ma.",4,Big Bang Theory,36,8
18986,Howard,16, Didn't you read my email?,4,Big Bang Theory,26,5
18988,Howard,16, Thank you.,4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
18991,Penny,16," Oh, hey. What's up?",4,Big Bang Theory,20,4
18992,Amy,16, I just wanted to check in on you.,4,Big Bang Theory,34,8
18993,Penny,16, Why?,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
18994,Amy,16," It seems like the appropriate thing to do when one's best friend finds herself replaced by a smart, beautiful woman with the smouldering sexuality of a crouched Bengal tiger.",4,Big Bang Theory,175,29
18995,Penny,16," I already told you, I'm okay with it. I mean, if anything, I'm quite pleased  that Leonard has found someone  that makes him so happy.",4,Big Bang Theory,135,25
18996,Amy,16," It's okay, it's okay.",4,Big Bang Theory,22,4
18997,Penny,16, Thank you.,4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
18998,Amy,16," Now, let's get these electrodes attached and see what's going on in that pretty little noggin of yours.",4,Big Bang Theory,104,18
18999,Penny,16, Okay.,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
19001,Penny,16, I smell Chinese food.,4,Big Bang Theory,22,4
19002,Sheldon,16, It's actually Thai. You're slipping.,4,Big Bang Theory,37,5
19003,Penny,16, Are Leonard and Priya here?,4,Big Bang Theory,28,5
19004,Sheldon,16, They went to Catalina for the weekend.,4,Big Bang Theory,39,7
19005,Penny,16, Oh. Where's Raj?,4,Big Bang Theory,17,3
19006,Sheldon,16," At home, forbidding it.",4,Big Bang Theory,24,4
19007,Penny,16, How about Howard?,4,Big Bang Theory,18,3
19008,Sheldon,16, I'm given to understand his mother grounded him for running away.,4,Big Bang Theory,66,11
19009,Penny,16," Oh, okay. Well, I guess it's just the two of us, huh?",4,Big Bang Theory,54,12
19010,Sheldon,16," Actually, it's the three of us.",4,Big Bang Theory,32,6
19011,Amy,16," What up, bestie? Good news. Thanks to you, I was able to make a rhesus monkey cry like a disgraced televangelist.",4,Big Bang Theory,114,21
19012,Penny,16, Great.,4,Big Bang Theory,7,1
19013,Amy,16," So, you feeling better?",4,Big Bang Theory,24,4
19014,Penny,16, Not really.,4,Big Bang Theory,12,2
19015,Amy,16," Sheldon, you have a guest who's upset.",4,Big Bang Theory,39,7
19016,Sheldon,16, Right. I'll make tea.,4,Big Bang Theory,22,4
19017,Penny,16," Oh, sweetie, it's okay. I don't want tea.",4,Big Bang Theory,42,8
19018,Sheldon,16, I'm sorry. It's not optional.,4,Big Bang Theory,30,5
19020,Sheldon,17," Buona sera, Luigi's Pizza. Buona sera. It means good evening in Italian. May I say, having to explain that to you calls into question the authenticity of your ristorante?",4,Big Bang Theory,171,29
19021,Leonard,17," Okay, I'm out of here.",4,Big Bang Theory,23,5
19022,Sheldon,17," Un momento. Oh, for heaven's sake, now you're being deliberately stupid.  Where are you going?",4,Big Bang Theory,95,15
19023,Leonard,17, I'm having dinner with Priya at Raj's. I think Howard's going to be there. You want to join us?,4,Big Bang Theory,96,19
19024,Sheldon,17," But tonight's Thursday. On Thursdays, everybody comes over here and has pizza. Or a reasonable facsimile prepared by someone claiming to be Luigi, but who sounds suspiciously like Jackie Chan.",4,Big Bang Theory,193,30
19025,Leonard,17, Can't we make a one-time exception for tonight?,4,Big Bang Theory,48,8
19026,Sheldon,17," We could. We could also stop using the letter M, but I think that idea is isguided and oronic.",4,Big Bang Theory,95,19
19027,Leonard,17, Just come with me to Raj's.,4,Big Bang Theory,28,6
19028,Sheldon,17," Well, I don't want to go to a party.",4,Big Bang Theory,37,9
19029,Leonard,17," It's not a party. It's the same group of people who hang out here, hanging out over there.",4,Big Bang Theory,91,18
19030,Sheldon,17," I'm sorry, but five people eating and chatting is a party.",4,Big Bang Theory,59,11
19031,Leonard,17, How come it's not a party when we do it here?,4,Big Bang Theory,46,11
19032,Sheldon,17, Because we don't throw parties.,4,Big Bang Theory,32,5
19033,Leonard,17," I don't know what to tell you, Sheldon. I'm going to see Priya. Everyone's over there. You coming or not?",4,Big Bang Theory,106,20
19034,Sheldon,17," Well, no, sir, and do you know why? In a word, tradition. Every Thursday night for the last eight years, you and I and our friends have gathered here in this very spot to break bread covered with cheese and sauce, discuss the issues of the day, and yes, share a laugh or two. But I guess our rich heritage means nothing to you.",4,Big Bang Theory,328,64
19035,Leonard,17, I guess you're right. See you later.,4,Big Bang Theory,37,7
19036,Sheldon,17, Wait! Leonard! Wait! What am I going to do for dinner?,4,Big Bang Theory,55,11
19037,Leonard,17, Come with me to Raj's and eat there.,4,Big Bang Theory,37,8
19038,Sheldon,17, I can't do that. What if he serves haggis and blood pudding?,4,Big Bang Theory,61,12
19039,Leonard,17, I really doubt that's what he'll serve.,4,Big Bang Theory,40,7
19040,Sheldon,17," But what if he does? I'll be obliged to dine on liver and lungs stuffed in a sheep's stomach. And frankly, blood pudding is essentially the same thing. I don't know why he's serving both.",4,Big Bang Theory,188,35
19041,Leonard,17," What do you want to do? You want to come with me, or do you want to sit here alone?",4,Big Bang Theory,84,20
19042,Sheldon,17," No, I'll go to your haggis party. But I'm telling you, this is adness. This is utter and coplete adness.",4,Big Bang Theory,105,20
19043,Sheldon,17," Oh, dear!",4,Big Bang Theory,10,2
19044,Leonard,17, What?,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
19045,Sheldon,17, Raj's television. I just realized we're about to spend an evening watching a plasma screen with a cluster of dead pixels in the upper left-hand corner.,4,Big Bang Theory,152,26
19046,Leonard,17, So don't watch TV. Read a book.,4,Big Bang Theory,32,7
19047,Sheldon,17," And be a social pariah? Oh, you know that's not my style.",4,Big Bang Theory,58,12
19048,Leonard,17, Ugh!,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
19049,Sheldon,17," The audible sigh is a show of exasperation, right?",4,Big Bang Theory,51,9
19050,Leonard,17, Right.,4,Big Bang Theory,7,1
19051,Sheldon,17, Is it about me or the dead pixels?,4,Big Bang Theory,35,8
19052,Raj,17," Hey, you're just in time. We made Tex-Mex.",4,Big Bang Theory,43,8
19053,Leonard,17," Oh, sounds great.",4,Big Bang Theory,18,3
19054,Sheldon,17," Oh, Indians making Tex-Mex. Might as well have had the Chinese pizza.",4,Big Bang Theory,70,12
19056,Leonard,17, Hi.,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
19057,Howard,17," That's got to be fun for you, huh? Watching Hofstadter suck the saliva out of your sister's mouth?",4,Big Bang Theory,99,18
19058,Sheldon,17," Excuse me. Before this evening goes any further, we need to decide where everyone is going to sit.",4,Big Bang Theory,99,18
19060,Sheldon,17," Oh, what fun. We're like hippies at a love-in.",4,Big Bang Theory,47,9
19061,Leonard,17, Just sit here.,4,Big Bang Theory,15,3
19062,Sheldon,17," Yeah, right on, man. Right on. Oh, look, it's Harry Potter and 98% of The Sorcerer's Stone.",4,Big Bang Theory,92,17
19063,Raj,17," Okay, we've got fajitas with all the fixins, so you make your own.",4,Big Bang Theory,67,13
19064,Sheldon,17," Wonderful. Dinner, some assembly required.",4,Big Bang Theory,43,5
19066,Sheldon,17, A margarita? Where are we? What is happening?,4,Big Bang Theory,46,8
19068,Penny,17," Oh. Hey, Sheldon. What can I get ya?",4,Big Bang Theory,37,8
19069,Sheldon,17, Water. Neat. With a little umbrella.,4,Big Bang Theory,37,6
19070,Penny,17, Where are all your friends?,4,Big Bang Theory,28,5
19071,Sheldon,17," Sadly, Penny, this evening, I am the Dark Knight, roaming these mean streets alone. A windbreaker for my cape, and a stern expression for my cowl.",4,Big Bang Theory,147,26
19072,Penny,17, Okay.,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
19073,Sheldon,17, Excuse me? Isn't this the point where the world-weary barkeep absentmindedly wipes down the bar and coaxes the woes out of the troubled patron?,4,Big Bang Theory,144,24
19074,Penny,17," Well, I was getting your stupid umbrella, but all right. What's troubling you, buddy?",4,Big Bang Theory,86,14
19075,Sheldon,17," I don't think your heart's in it, but since you asked. Apparently, because Leonard is dating Raj's sister, we're all forced to hang out at his apartment.",4,Big Bang Theory,154,27
19076,Penny,17," Oh, the horror.",4,Big Bang Theory,16,3
19077,Sheldon,17," Indeed. Yeah, at one point, Raj put on reggae music, and his sister took off her shoes. It was like the last days of Caligula.  Oh, I have to get this. Umbrella?",4,Big Bang Theory,162,32
19078,Penny,17, Ugh!,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
19079,Sheldon,17, Wonder what she's exasperated about. Hello?,4,Big Bang Theory,44,6
19080,Amy,17," Sheldon, are you all right? When last we spoke, you were going to take a taxi home from Raj's, but according to Facebook, you just checked in at the Cheesecake Factory.",4,Big Bang Theory,169,31
19081,Sheldon,17," Yes, I was in a taxi, but the driver didn't look at all like the photograph on his license, so I leapt out and ran for it.",4,Big Bang Theory,123,27
19082,Amy,17, Wise.,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
19083,Penny,17, There you go. Just like recovering alcoholics drink in the Caribbean.,4,Big Bang Theory,70,11
19084,Amy,17," Hi, bestie.",4,Big Bang Theory,12,2
19085,Penny,17," Oh. Hi, Amy. How you been?",4,Big Bang Theory,27,6
19086,Amy,17," Fine. From this angle, I can see up your nose.",4,Big Bang Theory,47,10
19087,Penny,17," Yeah, it's a great time to be alive, isn't it?",4,Big Bang Theory,47,10
19088,Sheldon,17, Don't worry. My problems can wait while you two hens finish your clucking.,4,Big Bang Theory,75,13
19089,Penny,17," Look, Sheldon, Leonard is dating Priya. She is staying with Raj. That means you're all probably gonna be hanging out there more.",4,Big Bang Theory,129,22
19090,Amy,17," Penny, I'm sorry you got dragged into this. I know you're devastated that your ex-boyfriend has found an exciting new lover with flawless, caramel-coloured skin.",4,Big Bang Theory,162,25
19091,Penny,17," Okay, I'm not upset about Leonard and Priya.",4,Big Bang Theory,45,8
19092,Amy,17, Your flaring nostrils indicate otherwise.,4,Big Bang Theory,42,5
19093,Sheldon,17, Cluck-cluck-cluck.,4,Big Bang Theory,19,1
19094,Amy,17," Sheldon, look at me. I think it's time to face the fact that Leonard is the nucleus of your social group. Where he goes, the group goes.",4,Big Bang Theory,137,27
19095,Sheldon,17, Leonard the nucleus? That makes no sense. I'm the whimsical elf that everyone looks to for a good time.,4,Big Bang Theory,104,19
19096,Amy,17, I'm not saying that you're not fun. You're the most fun person I know.,4,Big Bang Theory,71,14
19097,Penny,17, A lot of people think I'm fun to be around.,4,Big Bang Theory,44,10
19098,Amy,17," Don't be needy, bestie. That's probably part of what chased Leonard away. What I am saying, Sheldon, is that your group is Leonard-centric. If it were a town, it would be Leonardville. If it were an Islamic nation, Leonardstan. If it were the birthplace of motion pictures, we'd all be singing Hooray for Leonardwood.",4,Big Bang Theory,318,54
19099,Penny,17," Ooh, I got one. If you guys were a band, you'd be called Leonard and the Leonards.",4,Big Bang Theory,83,17
19100,Amy,17, So needy.,4,Big Bang Theory,10,2
19102,Leonard,17, What you doing?,4,Big Bang Theory,16,3
19103,Sheldon,17, I'm setting out snacks.,4,Big Bang Theory,24,4
19104,Leonard,17, You do realize everyone's eating at Raj's again tonight?,4,Big Bang Theory,57,9
19105,Sheldon,17," I didn't say the snacks were for you now, did I, Nosy Rosie?",4,Big Bang Theory,61,13
19106,Leonard,17, You're having people over?,4,Big Bang Theory,27,4
19107,Sheldon,17," Yes. Must be killing you wondering who. Fine, I'll tell you. Stuart from the comic bookstore, Barry Kripke from the university, Penny's ex-boyfriend Zack and TV's LeVar Burton.",4,Big Bang Theory,177,28
19108,Leonard,17, Really? LeVar Burton's coming here?,4,Big Bang Theory,36,5
19109,Sheldon,17, Possibly. I Tweeted him.,4,Big Bang Theory,25,4
19110,Leonard,17," Okay, well, tell him I loved him on Star Trek.",4,Big Bang Theory,47,10
19111,Sheldon,17," Please, Leonard, stop trying to horn in on my new friends.",4,Big Bang Theory,59,11
19112,Leonard,17, Of course. Good night.,4,Big Bang Theory,23,4
19113,Sheldon,17, Leonard.,4,Big Bang Theory,9,1
19114,Leonard,17, Yeah?,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
19115,Sheldon,17," We had a good run, you and I.",4,Big Bang Theory,30,8
19116,Leonard,17, Okay.,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
19117,Sheldon,17, But change is a part of life.,4,Big Bang Theory,30,7
19118,Leonard,17, It certainly is.,4,Big Bang Theory,17,3
19119,Sheldon,17, Okay. I have guests coming. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave now.,4,Big Bang Theory,82,17
19120,Leonard,17, I am leaving.,4,Big Bang Theory,14,3
19121,Sheldon,17," Don't make this harder than it is, Leonard.",4,Big Bang Theory,44,8
19122,Leonard,17," Good-bye, Sheldon.",4,Big Bang Theory,19,2
19123,Sheldon,17," And good-bye to you, sir. He'll be back.",4,Big Bang Theory,41,8
19124,Leonard,17, Of course I'll be back. I live here!,4,Big Bang Theory,37,8
19126,Sheldon,17," Well, it would appear LeVar Burton won't be joining us so let's get started. Um, I thought we'd begin by going around the room, introducing ourselves and saying a little bit about why we're here. Okay. I'm Sheldon. Uh, for regular readers of The New England Journal of High Energy Physics, I need no introduction. If you're not familiar with that publication, there's a free copy in your goody bag. Stuart?",4,Big Bang Theory,407,71
19128,Sheldon,17," That's very nice, Stuart. Zack?",4,Big Bang Theory,32,5
19130,Sheldon,17, Of course. Barry?,4,Big Bang Theory,18,3
19132,Sheldon,17," Patience, patience, Barry. The whaffle the raffle is the grand finale to an evening-long festival of fun and folly.",4,Big Bang Theory,116,19
19134,Sheldon,17," Yes, you must be present to win.",4,Big Bang Theory,33,7
19137,Penny,17," Oh, hey.",4,Big Bang Theory,9,2
19139,Amy,17," Yo, P-dog.",4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
19140,Penny,17, What's up?,4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
19142,Amy,17," Parenthetical, the term kidnap is being used playfully.",4,Big Bang Theory,56,8
19143,Penny,17, I kind of figured that.,4,Big Bang Theory,24,5
19144,Amy,17, Good. Now put this pillowcase over your head.,4,Big Bang Theory,46,8
19145,Penny,17, No.,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
19146,Amy,17," She used to be much more fun, until Leonard punched her in the heart.",4,Big Bang Theory,70,14
19148,Penny,17," Oh. Gee, thanks, but I'm not really in the mood.",4,Big Bang Theory,49,10
19149,Amy,17, You do understand that it will distract you from obsessing over the rich variety of sweet loving that your ex-boyfriend is currently receiving from the fiery jewel of Mumbai.,4,Big Bang Theory,175,29
19150,Penny,17," Okay, look, if I agree to go out with you guys, will you promise to stop pestering me about Leonard and Priya?",4,Big Bang Theory,111,22
19151,Amy,17, Yes.,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
19153,Penny,17, All right. I'll go change. Come on in.,4,Big Bang Theory,39,8
19154,Amy,17," If you'd have let me bring the chloroform, we wouldn't have had to put up with all this jibber-jabber.",4,Big Bang Theory,103,19
19157,Sheldon,17, Question. Was it a Jacuzzi or a hot tub?,4,Big Bang Theory,41,9
19160,Sheldon,17," Jacuzzi is a commercial brand. Hot tub is the generic term, i.e., all Jacuzzis are hot tubs, but not all hot tubs are Jacuzzis.",4,Big Bang Theory,128,24
19162,Sheldon,17," Surprisingly, yes.",4,Big Bang Theory,19,2
19166,Sheldon,17, The water level rose.,4,Big Bang Theory,22,4
19168,Sheldon,17," Of course it did. It's said that Archimedes, the ancient Greek mathematician, discovered the principle of displacement while taking a bath.",4,Big Bang Theory,140,21
19170,Sheldon,17," Forgive me, but I think you'll find my story is more interesting.",4,Big Bang Theory,66,12
19172,Sheldon,17," Better. It has a gold crown. You see, the king wondered how much gold was in it and charged Archimedes with coming up with the solution. Because the crown was irregularly shaped, there was no way to mathematically determine its volume. But, while bathing, Archimedes realized he could immerse the crown and measure the amount the water rose.",4,Big Bang Theory,342,58
19174,Sheldon,17," When he finished, he shouted Eureka!",4,Big Bang Theory,37,6
19176,Sheldon,17," All right, that concludes the getting to know you portion of the evening. Who's ready to play some vintage video games? And tonight's selections include ColecoVision's Smurf Rescue in Gargamel's Castle, Atari's Cookie Monster Munch, and for you text adventure aficionados, Zork. Pick me, pick me. I'm fun.",4,Big Bang Theory,306,48
19181,Sheldon,17, I'm unhappy.,4,Big Bang Theory,13,2
19183,Leonard,17, This is delicious. Where'd you learn to make chili?,4,Big Bang Theory,52,9
19185,Leonard,17, I hope she wasn't anything like my flatmate from Texas.,4,Big Bang Theory,56,10
19187,Howard,17," Oh, please. That crazy bastard's looking at quirky in the rearview mirror.",4,Big Bang Theory,75,12
19188,Leonard,17," Did you know that, per our roommate agreement, I have to wash my feet before I get in the shower? And not in the sink. We each have special buckets.",4,Big Bang Theory,149,30
19189,Howard,17," Raj, did you ever tell your sister about the time Sheldon got punched by Bill Gates?",4,Big Bang Theory,85,16
19191,Raj,17," Nope. Gates gave a speech at the university. Sheldon went up to him afterwards and said, maybe if you weren't so distracted by sick children in Africa, you could have put a little more thought into Windows Vista.â€ù",4,Big Bang Theory,216,38
19192,Leonard,17, Bam. Right in the nose. Made me proud to own a PC.,4,Big Bang Theory,51,12
19193,Raj,17, I'd like to propose a toast to a rare and wonderful Sheldon-free evening.,4,Big Bang Theory,74,13
19194,Leonard,17," Hear, hear.",4,Big Bang Theory,12,2
19195,Howard,17, Cheers. You realize that's the first time we've ever done that without having to listen to Sheldon tell us why it's called a toast?,4,Big Bang Theory,132,24
19197,Leonard,17," Oh, the ancient Romans put spiced toast in their punch bowls.",4,Big Bang Theory,62,11
19198,Raj,17, Sheldon tells it better.,4,Big Bang Theory,25,4
19199,Leonard,17, He kind of does.,4,Big Bang Theory,17,4
19200,Howard,17, Yeah.,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
19201,Leonard,17," Aw, hell, I miss him.",4,Big Bang Theory,22,5
19203,Penny,17," So, where do you guys want to go dancing?",4,Big Bang Theory,42,9
19205,Amy,17," Yes, perhaps somewhere packed tightly with young, beautiful bodies sweating and writhing against each other in a glorious orgy of the flesh.",4,Big Bang Theory,141,22
19206,Penny,17," Oh, yeah, I know that place. What do you think?",4,Big Bang Theory,48,10
19207,Amy,17," That should display enough of your bosom to attract a new mate, or a hungry infant.",4,Big Bang Theory,84,16
19208,Penny,17," Okay, let's go through this one more time. Just because Leonard has a new girlfriend does not mean I need to go out and hook up with some guy.",4,Big Bang Theory,143,29
19210,Penny,17," Well, yeah, I guess.",4,Big Bang Theory,21,4
19212,Penny,17, More or less.,4,Big Bang Theory,14,3
19213,Amy,17, What's that like?,4,Big Bang Theory,18,3
19214,Penny,17," I don't know. It's fun while you're doing it. And then after, it's mostly embarrassment, self-loathing and regret.",4,Big Bang Theory,115,18
19216,Penny,17," Yeah, well, it's not gonna happen tonight. You know, for the first time in my life, I am not in a relationship, and I'm totally okay with it.",4,Big Bang Theory,142,28
19217,Amy,17," You know, if being on your own is new to you, I'd be happy to share some tension-relieving techniques for ladies I've perfected over the years. For example, do you have an electric toothbrush?",4,Big Bang Theory,193,34
19218,Penny,17," Um, no.",4,Big Bang Theory,8,2
19219,Amy,17, You should get one.,4,Big Bang Theory,20,4
19221,Amy,17, It appears to be something preserved between two pieces of acrylic.,4,Big Bang Theory,68,11
19222,Penny,17," Oh, it's a snowflake from the North Pole. Leonard gave it to me last year.",4,Big Bang Theory,75,15
19224,Penny,17," Yeah, it was.",4,Big Bang Theory,14,3
19226,Amy,17," Saying that while holding a snowflake is a little bit heavy-handed, don't you think?",4,Big Bang Theory,85,14
19227,Penny,17," Let me see that. Oh, screw it. I can deal with a little self-loathing. Let's go find me a heinie to bite.",4,Big Bang Theory,106,22
19228,Amy,17," Outstanding. And if we fail, we can always stop at CVS and pick you out a nice toothbrush. I call mine Gerard.",4,Big Bang Theory,111,22
19232,Sheldon,17, No.,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
19236,Leonard,17, He actually got pretty good. He made us all matching serapes.,4,Big Bang Theory,62,11
19237,Raj,17, I still wear mine when there's a nip in the air.,4,Big Bang Theory,49,11
19239,Leonard,17, Long before the cats. I think it was around the time he tried to declare our apartment a sovereign nation. I still have some of the currency.,4,Big Bang Theory,142,27
19240,Sheldon,17,  All my friends.  All my friends.  All my friends.,4,Big Bang Theory,51,9
19241,Howard,17, I think it's like Beetlejuice. We said his name too many times.,4,Big Bang Theory,64,12
19242,Raj,17, Come on in.,4,Big Bang Theory,12,3
19243,Sheldon,17, Thank you.,4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
19244,Leonard,17, Hey. I thought you were with your new buddies.,4,Big Bang Theory,47,9
19245,Sheldon,17, I had to leave. They were having fun wrong.,4,Big Bang Theory,44,9
19247,Sheldon,17, Thank you.,4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
19249,Sheldon,17, Are there beans in it?,4,Big Bang Theory,23,5
19251,Sheldon,17," Then it's not chili. Real chili has no beans in it, but you're from a foreign land, so your ignorance is forgiven.",4,Big Bang Theory,115,22
19253,Sheldon,17," Yes, please. Your girlfriend's a little short-tempered.",4,Big Bang Theory,56,7
19254,Raj,17," I'd like to propose a toast to friends, no matter how quirky.",4,Big Bang Theory,62,12
19256,Sheldon,17," Priya, do you know why this is called a toast?",4,Big Bang Theory,47,10
19258,Sheldon,17, She's also a bit of a know-it-all. Mmm. This is good. Whatever it is.,4,Big Bang Theory,70,14
19263,Leonard,18, Morning.,4,Big Bang Theory,9,1
19265,Leonard,18," Mm-hmm. Great. Hey, can I ask you something?",4,Big Bang Theory,45,8
19267,Leonard,18," Last night, me wanting to try that stuff out of the Kama Sutra, was that fun for you or kinda racially insensitive?",4,Big Bang Theory,116,22
19269,Leonard,18," Hey, if you can find a book called weird sex with white boys, I'd be okay with that.",4,Big Bang Theory,85,18
19271,Leonard,18, I tried in the seventh grade. I could never get used to them.,4,Big Bang Theory,62,13
19273,Leonard,18," Yeah, if I had contacts I would have been the coolest debate club president ever to be stuffed into his own cello case.",4,Big Bang Theory,120,23
19275,Leonard,18, Th-th-th-that's okay. I can infer from context.,4,Big Bang Theory,48,7
19277,Howard,18," Hey, Raj, wanna see a new magic trick I've been working on?",4,Big Bang Theory,60,12
19278,Sheldon,18," Howard, if I may interject here with a piece of friendly advice. Is working on magic tricks really how you want to spend your time? Granted, you're just an engineer, but that doesn't mean you might not someday build a geegaw or a thingamabob that may get you a thank you in someone else's Nobel prize acceptance speech.",4,Big Bang Theory,320,58
19279,Raj,18," Is the trick making him disappear? Sure, let's see it.",4,Big Bang Theory,55,10
19280,Howard,18," Here, shuffle these.",4,Big Bang Theory,21,3
19281,Raj,18, Okay.,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
19282,Howard,18," Now spread them out on the table face down. Pick one, look at it.",4,Big Bang Theory,66,14
19283,Raj,18, Okay.,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
19284,Howard,18," Now remember your card, put it back in the deck.",4,Big Bang Theory,49,10
19285,Sheldon,18, Is it any wonder he doesn't have a doctorate?,4,Big Bang Theory,46,9
19286,Howard,18," Remind me, what's your birthday?",4,Big Bang Theory,33,5
19287,Raj,18, October sixth.,4,Big Bang Theory,15,2
19288,Howard,18," Okay, October is the tenth month. So ten, one plus zero is one, plus six is seven. Turn over the seventh card.",4,Big Bang Theory,111,22
19289,Raj,18, How about that!,4,Big Bang Theory,16,3
19290,Howard,18, Is that your card?,4,Big Bang Theory,19,4
19291,Raj,18," Yes, it is. Very cool!",4,Big Bang Theory,23,5
19292,Sheldon,18, It's not cool. It's a childish trick designed to confuse and intrigue simpletons. How'd you do it?,4,Big Bang Theory,99,17
19293,Howard,18, A magician never reveals his secrets. But surely a future Nobel prize winner can figure it out.,4,Big Bang Theory,96,17
19294,Sheldon,18, Fine. Give me a second.,4,Big Bang Theory,24,5
19295,Howard,18," You ever notice when he thinks real hard, it smells like bacon?",4,Big Bang Theory,64,12
19297,Leonard,18, Sorry! Oop!,4,Big Bang Theory,12,2
19298,Leonard,18," Sorry! Pardon me! Oh, I'm so sorry! My fault! Check it out. I just got contacts.",4,Big Bang Theory,81,16
19300,Penny,18," One, two, three, four, five. No way.",4,Big Bang Theory,37,7
19301,Howard,18," That's your card, right?",4,Big Bang Theory,25,4
19302,Penny,18, Seven of clubs! That is amazing!,4,Big Bang Theory,33,6
19303,Sheldon,18, It's not amazing. All magic tricks are merely a combination of manipulation and misdirection with the occasional dwarf in a box wiggling his feet.,4,Big Bang Theory,147,24
19304,Howard,18," Oh, really? So how did I do it?",4,Big Bang Theory,32,8
19305,Sheldon,18," Well, I don't care how you did it. I have more important things to think about. Clearly, the cards are marked.",4,Big Bang Theory,111,21
19306,Howard,18, I thought you had more important things to think about.,4,Big Bang Theory,56,10
19307,Sheldon,18," I do. You just happen to have caught me on a break. Oh, let me see those cards.",4,Big Bang Theory,80,18
19308,Penny,18," Oh, big deal. Not knowing is part of the fun.",4,Big Bang Theory,46,10
19309,Sheldon,18, Not knowing is part of the fun. Was that the motto of your community college?,4,Big Bang Theory,78,15
19310,Leonard,18," Hey, guys, what do you think? Priya took me clothes shopping.",4,Big Bang Theory,62,11
19311,Penny,18," Hey, you look great. Good for you, Priya. I could never get that stupid hoodie off him when we were well, you look great.",4,Big Bang Theory,122,24
19312,Leonard,18, Thank you.,4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
19314,Leonard,18," Yeah, good. New contacts. I should have done this years ago.",4,Big Bang Theory,61,11
19315,Howard,18, So you finally getting used to them doing it on a daily basis?,4,Big Bang Theory,63,13
19316,Penny,18, I'm not going out with him. He can sleep with whoever he wants.,4,Big Bang Theory,64,13
19317,Howard,18," Yeah, I was talking to Raj.",4,Big Bang Theory,28,6
19318,Penny,18, Oopsy.,4,Big Bang Theory,7,1
19319,Sheldon,18, This deck is rigged in some fashion.,4,Big Bang Theory,37,7
19320,Howard,18, Fine. Get another deck and I'll do the trick with that.,4,Big Bang Theory,56,11
19321,Sheldon,18, So you're saying this is a regulation deck?,4,Big Bang Theory,44,8
19322,Howard,18," I'm saying believe in magic, you muggle.",4,Big Bang Theory,41,7
19323,Penny,18," You know, well, I'm happy Leonard's found someone. Not that anybody asked.",4,Big Bang Theory,75,12
19326,Leonard,18, Just two. Everyday and dress.,4,Big Bang Theory,30,5
19328,Leonard,18," Oh, my god, you're breaking up with me! Why would you take me out shopping and then break up with me? That is so cruel.",4,Big Bang Theory,120,25
19330,Leonard,18," Oh, okay. So, what's up?",4,Big Bang Theory,25,5
19332,Leonard,18," I know. I usually never see my ex-girlfriends, unless their hard drives crash.",4,Big Bang Theory,79,13
19334,Leonard,18," Um, not great, I guess. But Penny and I are just friends.",4,Big Bang Theory,58,12
19336,Leonard,18," No, no-no-no, I'm ready! I gave up the gift of sight for you. If that's not moving on, what is?",4,Big Bang Theory,96,20
19338,Leonard,18, Oh. Okay.,4,Big Bang Theory,10,2
19340,Leonard,18," No, no, I'm confident. It's not like I'm unfamiliar with the get lost conversation. Although, this will be the first time I'll be the one saying it.",4,Big Bang Theory,149,27
19342,Leonard,18," Sure. Oh, god, you smell so good. Of course, that could just be my other senses getting stronger. Hypothetically, if I had access To a Lieutenant Uhura uniform, would you wear it?",4,Big Bang Theory,180,32
19344,Leonard,18," I'm sorry. I'm, never mind.",4,Big Bang Theory,28,5
19346,Howard,18, And was your card the jack of diamonds?,4,Big Bang Theory,40,8
19347,Penny,18," Oh, unbelievable! Know how he did it yet?",4,Big Bang Theory,42,8
19348,Sheldon,18, Um,4,Big Bang Theory,3,1
19349,Penny,18," Aw, he has the same look my little nephew gets when he can't figure out how I got his nose.",4,Big Bang Theory,92,20
19350,Howard,18," You know, I have some remedial magic tricks that might be more your speed. Like, ooh, look! The pencil's rubber!",4,Big Bang Theory,113,20
19351,Penny,18," Hey, I think I know how you did the card trick.",4,Big Bang Theory,48,11
19352,Sheldon,18," Oh, oh, please, if I don't know, you don't know. That's axiomatic.",4,Big Bang Theory,67,12
19353,Penny,18, Come here. ,4,Big Bang Theory,12,2
19354,Howard,18, You're right.,4,Big Bang Theory,14,2
19355,Penny,18, Not too bad for someone who doesn't know what axiomatic means.,4,Big Bang Theory,63,11
19357,Leonard,18," Oh, hi.",4,Big Bang Theory,8,2
19358,Penny,18," Hey, you. What happened with the contacts?",4,Big Bang Theory,43,7
19359,Leonard,18, One of them's upstairs. The other one sort of slipped back into my skull.,4,Big Bang Theory,74,14
19360,Penny,18," Hey, is that one of the new shirts Priya got you?",4,Big Bang Theory,50,11
19361,Leonard,18, Yeah.,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
19362,Penny,18, You don't wanna wash that.,4,Big Bang Theory,27,5
19363,Leonard,18, No?,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
19364,Penny,18," No, that's silk. Seriously, what would you do without me?",4,Big Bang Theory,58,10
19365,Leonard,18, Yeah.,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
19366,Penny,18," You know, I gotta tell you, I think you got a real winner with Priya.",4,Big Bang Theory,70,15
19367,Leonard,18," Yeah, me, too.",4,Big Bang Theory,15,3
19368,Penny,18," She seems really sweet. Believe me, you do not want to take that for granted. There are a lot of bitches out there.",4,Big Bang Theory,116,23
19369,Leonard,18," Yeah, bitches are the worst.",4,Big Bang Theory,29,5
19370,Penny,18," All right, well I'll see you later.",4,Big Bang Theory,36,7
19371,Leonard,18," Uh, Penny, there's something I have to tell you.",4,Big Bang Theory,49,9
19372,Penny,18, What?,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
19373,Leonard,18," Okay, uh, how do I put this? Um, are you familiar with Darwin's observation of the finches in the Galapagos Islands?",4,Big Bang Theory,117,21
19374,Penny,18, Did they make a movie about it?,4,Big Bang Theory,32,7
19375,Leonard,18, No.,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
19376,Penny,18, Then no.,4,Big Bang Theory,9,2
19377,Leonard,18," All right, well, anyway, Darwin observed that when two groups of finches competed over the same food source, eventually one of them would evolve a different beak shape so they could feed on something else.",4,Big Bang Theory,206,35
19378,Penny,18, Okay.,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
19379,Leonard,18, So what do you think we can learn from that behaviour that we can apply to our own lives?,4,Big Bang Theory,90,19
19380,Penny,18," Uh, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush?",4,Big Bang Theory,49,12
19381,Leonard,18," Sure, that has birds in it.",4,Big Bang Theory,28,6
19382,Penny,18," It's fun talking to you, Leonard, I always learn stuff.",4,Big Bang Theory,56,10
19383,Leonard,18," I'm sorry, but I'm gonna count that.",4,Big Bang Theory,37,7
19386,Leonard,18, Yeah. The doctor didn't want me to rub my eye during the night. It was either this or one of those giant neck cones.,4,Big Bang Theory,117,24
19388,Leonard,18," Oh, yes. Indeed, I did.",4,Big Bang Theory,24,5
19390,Leonard,18, She completely understood everything I said. Case closed.,4,Big Bang Theory,58,8
19392,Leonard,18," Maybe, but that's not my problem. She's not my girlfriend, you are.",4,Big Bang Theory,68,12
19394,Leonard,18," Is the autumn cruel for letting the flowers die, or is that just nature's way?",4,Big Bang Theory,79,15
19395,Sheldon,18,  Leonard?  Leonard?  Leonard?,4,Big Bang Theory,30,3
19396,Leonard,18, What?,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
19397,Sheldon,18," I think I figured out Wolowitz's magic trick, and I need you to pick a card.",4,Big Bang Theory,77,16
19398,Leonard,18," I am not opening that door, Sheldon.",4,Big Bang Theory,37,7
19399,Sheldon,18," As you wish.  Pick a card, put it back, and prepare to be amazed.  Did you pick one?",4,Big Bang Theory,85,18
19400,Leonard,18, Yep.,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
19401,Sheldon,18,  Is this your card?,4,Big Bang Theory,20,4
19402,Leonard,18,  Nope.,4,Big Bang Theory,7,1
19403,Sheldon,18, Drat. Is this your card?,4,Big Bang Theory,25,5
19404,Leonard,18, No.,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
19405,Sheldon,18, I'll be right back.,4,Big Bang Theory,20,4
19407,Sheldon,18," Pick a card, Sheldon. Now look at it, and put it back in the deck. Now do you remember your card? Of course I do, I have an eidetic memory. My apologies. Now shuffle the cards. Shuffling. Wait here. Processing image, cross-referencing.",4,Big Bang Theory,236,42
19408,Leonard,18, Whatcha doin'?,4,Big Bang Theory,15,2
19409,Sheldon,18, I'm reverse engineering Wolowitz's magic trick.,4,Big Bang Theory,48,6
19410,Leonard,18, What's up with the infrared cameras?,4,Big Bang Theory,37,6
19411,Sheldon,18," I'm measuring residual heat levels on the playing cards to determine which one's been touched. By the way, if you hope to have children, I suggest you switch from briefs to boxers. Your testicles look a tad warm.",4,Big Bang Theory,213,38
19412,Leonard,18," Holy crap, are you connected to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory?",4,Big Bang Theory,67,11
19413,Sheldon,18, Yes. I'm using their Cray Supercomputer to analyze shuffling patterns.,4,Big Bang Theory,71,10
19414,Leonard,18," Sheldon, that computer is used for National defence. Hacking into it is a Federal crime.",4,Big Bang Theory,89,15
19415,Sheldon,18," Relax, we're not under attack right now.",4,Big Bang Theory,41,7
19416,Leonard,18," Okay, I'm leaving before the black helicopters get here.",4,Big Bang Theory,57,9
19417,Sheldon,18," And is this my card? Rats! I wonder if Howard used a radioactive tracer. Where am I going to find Uranium-235 this time of night? Come on, Craigslist.",4,Big Bang Theory,151,28
19419,Leonard,18, Is it racist that I took you to an Indian restaurant?,4,Big Bang Theory,54,11
19421,Leonard,18," Or as you probably call it back home, food.",4,Big Bang Theory,44,9
19423,Leonard,18," No, no, I do. It's just I knew I was having curry tonight and I only want one part of my body to burn at a time.",4,Big Bang Theory,113,27
19425,Leonard,18, Does that mean you'd relocate here permanently?,4,Big Bang Theory,48,7
19427,Leonard,18,"Oh, I love it. Oh, that's great!",4,Big Bang Theory,32,7
19428,Penny,18, Hi! Hi! Just hang on.,4,Big Bang Theory,22,5
19429,Leonard,18, Small world.,4,Big Bang Theory,13,2
19431,Leonard,18," Of course, I did. I talked and talked and talked.",4,Big Bang Theory,50,10
19432,Penny,18," Hey! Look at Leonard in his fancy-ass grownup clothes. Way to go, Priya. For once, he doesn't look like a mannequin in the boys' department. Hey, did he tell you I saved the silk shirt?",4,Big Bang Theory,186,35
19434,Penny,18," He was gonna throw it in the washing machine with his Spiderman underwear. That's our Lenny, huh?",4,Big Bang Theory,98,17
19436,Penny,18," So, how's the food here? Oh, wow, that is really, really good. Oh, I'm sorry. You guys are on a date. We can hang out anytime. Have fun.",4,Big Bang Theory,137,28
19437,Leonard,18, Bye.,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
19439,Penny,18," Oh, that's, hot, hot, hot, hot! Whoo! It really sneaks up on ya, huh? All right, I gotta go.",4,Big Bang Theory,93,19
19440,Leonard,18, It is pretty spicy.,4,Big Bang Theory,20,4
19442,Sheldon,18," Oh, I've been meaning to tell you, I figured out your magic trick.",4,Big Bang Theory,67,13
19443,Howard,18, Really?,4,Big Bang Theory,8,1
19444,Sheldon,18," Oh, yes. In fact, I improved upon it.",4,Big Bang Theory,38,8
19445,Howard,18," I'd love to see that. How about you, Raj?",4,Big Bang Theory,42,9
19446,Raj,18, Beefaroni and a show? How do you turn that down?,4,Big Bang Theory,49,10
19447,Sheldon,18, All right. Pick a card.,4,Big Bang Theory,24,5
19448,Howard,18, Okay.,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
19449,Sheldon,18, Bippity-boppity-boo.,4,Big Bang Theory,21,1
19450,Howard,18, What's with the wand and the beep?,4,Big Bang Theory,35,7
19451,Sheldon,18," The wand is called showmanship, and the beep is none of your business. Oh! Excuse me, I'm getting a text message completely unrelated to this magic trick. Oh, look, my dry cleaning's ready. And your card was the five of spades. Ta-da.",4,Big Bang Theory,235,42
19452,Raj,18, These cards have barcodes on them. The wand is a reader. It's transmitting to your phone.,4,Big Bang Theory,90,16
19453,Sheldon,18," I said, ta-da. Show's over.",4,Big Bang Theory,28,5
19454,Howard,18," That's pathetic. Let me show you how a real magician does it. Raj, take a card. Don't let me see it.",4,Big Bang Theory,101,21
19455,Raj,18, Okay.,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
19456,Howard,18, Three of clubs. ,4,Big Bang Theory,17,3
19457,Raj,18," Son of a gun, you're blowing my mind!",4,Big Bang Theory,38,8
19458,Howard,18, Bippity-boppity-boo-yah!,4,Big Bang Theory,25,1
19459,Sheldon,18, That does it. I'm getting uranium.,4,Big Bang Theory,35,6
19460,Raj,18, You ever gonna tell him?,4,Big Bang Theory,25,5
19461,Howard,18, Maybe. When it stops being fun.,4,Big Bang Theory,32,6
19462,Raj,18, So never.,4,Big Bang Theory,10,2
19464,Penny,18," Oh, hey, I was just on my way to work.",4,Big Bang Theory,39,10
19465,Leonard,18," Oh, okay, it's not important. It can wait.",4,Big Bang Theory,43,8
19466,Penny,18," No, it's all right. Walk me down. So, what's up?",4,Big Bang Theory,49,10
19467,Leonard,18," Uh, I kind of have a problem I was hoping you could help me with.",4,Big Bang Theory,66,15
19468,Penny,18," Sure, anything.",4,Big Bang Theory,16,2
19469,Leonard,18, Move out.,4,Big Bang Theory,10,2
19470,Penny,18, What?,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
19471,Leonard,18," Well, uh, not far. Hey, if you ever wanna start a family, La CaÃ±ada has some great schools.",4,Big Bang Theory,93,18
19472,Penny,18," Okay, I'm not moving anywhere. What the hell is this all about?",4,Big Bang Theory,64,12
19473,Leonard,18," Why does it have to be about anything? Can't a fella ask his buddy to relocate, no questions asked?",4,Big Bang Theory,100,19
19474,Penny,18," Oh, for god's sake, Leonard, this is about Priya, isn't it? She doesn't want me hanging out with you.",4,Big Bang Theory,102,19
19475,Leonard,18," Yes. There, I said it.",4,Big Bang Theory,23,5
19476,Penny,18," Okay, look, I happen to like your girlfriend.",4,Big Bang Theory,46,8
19477,Leonard,18, And she likes you.,4,Big Bang Theory,19,4
19478,Penny,18," No, she doesn't.",4,Big Bang Theory,17,3
19479,Leonard,18," Not really, no.",4,Big Bang Theory,16,3
19480,Penny,18," It doesn't matter. Look, I promise from now on I will keep my distance from you.",4,Big Bang Theory,81,16
19481,Leonard,18," Well, now, hold on. What kind of distance are we talking about? Because we are neighbours. I mean, I can hear the toilet flush in your apartment.",4,Big Bang Theory,146,27
19482,Penny,18, You can hear my toilet flush?,4,Big Bang Theory,30,6
19483,Leonard,18," I don't listen for it, but it's nice to know everything's okay with your plumbing. The building's plumbing.",4,Big Bang Theory,108,18
19484,Penny,18," Leonard, I get it. You're in a new relationship now. And I'm happy for you. So why don't we just shake hands and part friends?",4,Big Bang Theory,127,25
19485,Leonard,18," Well, now hold on, how about this? How about we still hang out, but on the down-low?",4,Big Bang Theory,85,17
19486,Penny,18, Are you really that kind of guy?,4,Big Bang Theory,33,7
19487,Leonard,18, No. I actually felt kinda silly just saying on the down-low.,4,Big Bang Theory,61,11
19488,Penny,18," Good-bye, Leonard.",4,Big Bang Theory,19,2
19489,Leonard,18," Penny, wait.  Damned contacts.",4,Big Bang Theory,31,4
19491,Howard,18, Incoming.,4,Big Bang Theory,10,1
19492,Raj,18, Hi!,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
19493,Howard,18, Hey!,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
19494,Sheldon,18, Hello.,4,Big Bang Theory,7,1
19495,Raj,18," Why so glum, chum?",4,Big Bang Theory,19,4
19496,Sheldon,18," Apparently, you can't hack into a government supercomputer and then try to buy uranium without the Department of Homeland Security tattling to your mother.",4,Big Bang Theory,156,24
19497,Howard,18," Oh, that's too bad. Figure out the magic trick yet?",4,Big Bang Theory,52,10
19498,Sheldon,18, Figure out the magic trick yet?,4,Big Bang Theory,32,6
19499,Howard,18, Want me to tell you how to do it?,4,Big Bang Theory,34,9
19500,Sheldon,18, No.,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
19501,Howard,18, I'll show you one more time. Raj?,4,Big Bang Theory,34,7
19502,Sheldon,18," Hang on. This time do it with me, so I can make sure there's no monkey business.",4,Big Bang Theory,81,17
19503,Howard,18, All right. . Two of hearts.,4,Big Bang Theory,28,6
19504,Sheldon,18, I hate you.,4,Big Bang Theory,12,3
19505,Howard,18," Yeah, he's gonna win the Nobel prize.",4,Big Bang Theory,38,7
19507,Sheldon,19," Why hast thou forsaken me, O deity whose existence I doubt?",4,Big Bang Theory,60,11
19509,Leonard,19, What's going on?,4,Big Bang Theory,17,3
19510,Sheldon,19," They stole everything, Leonard, everything.",4,Big Bang Theory,44,5
19512,Leonard,19," Yeah, Leonard Hofstadter. What happened?",4,Big Bang Theory,41,5
19514,Leonard,19," Oh, my God, what did they get?",4,Big Bang Theory,31,7
19515,Sheldon,19," What didn't they get? They got my enchanted weapons, my vicious gladiator armour, my wand of untainted power, and all my gold.",4,Big Bang Theory,127,22
19516,Leonard,19, You called the police because someone hacked your World of Warcraft account?,4,Big Bang Theory,77,12
19517,Sheldon,19," What choice did I have? The mighty Sheldor, level 85 blood elf, hero of the Eastern kingdoms, has been picked clean, like a carcass in the desert sun. Plus, the FBI hung up on me.",4,Big Bang Theory,180,35
19519,Sheldon,19, They took my battle ostrich.,4,Big Bang Theory,29,5
19520,Leonard,19," Oh, no, not Glenn?",4,Big Bang Theory,19,4
19521,Sheldon,19," Yes, Glenn! The only bird I ever loved.",4,Big Bang Theory,40,8
19523,Leonard,19," Thank you, officer.",4,Big Bang Theory,20,3
19524,Sheldon,19, Wait a minute! You're not going to do anything?,4,Big Bang Theory,48,9
19526,Sheldon,19, Doctor Cooper.,4,Big Bang Theory,15,2
19528,Leonard,19, Not the kind with access to drugs.,4,Big Bang Theory,35,7
19530,Sheldon,19," That's from Avatar, World of Warcraft takes place in Azeroth. Goodness gracious, how are you allowed to carry a gun? Can you at least refer me to a rogue ex-cop?",4,Big Bang Theory,162,30
19532,Sheldon,19," You know, one who was drummed off the force because he refused to play by the rules, and now he hires himself out to impose his own brand of rough justice?",4,Big Bang Theory,156,31
19534,Leonard,19," Thank you, officer.",4,Big Bang Theory,20,3
19535,Sheldon,19, It's all gone. All gone.,4,Big Bang Theory,25,5
19536,Leonard,19," I'm really sorry, Sheldon.",4,Big Bang Theory,27,4
19537,Sheldon,19," What kind of world do we live in, where a man would take another man's battle ostrich?",4,Big Bang Theory,87,17
19538,Leonard,19, I don't know.,4,Big Bang Theory,14,3
19539,Sheldon,19," This act of aggression must be met with swift and cruel ferocity. It is time to cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of war.",4,Big Bang Theory,121,25
19540,Leonard,19," I'm on it.  Hi, Mrs. Wolowitz. Is, is Howard there? Okay, thanks. That particular dog of war will have to call you back after his bath.",4,Big Bang Theory,136,26
19541,Sheldon,19, See if Raj is done with Pilates.,4,Big Bang Theory,33,7
19543,Sheldon,19," Three thousand hours. Three thousand hours clicking on that mouse, collecting weapons and gold. It's almost as if it was a huge waste of time.",4,Big Bang Theory,143,25
19544,Howard,19," Whoever did this knew what they were doing. He got in and out of your account in under 15 minutes, transferred all your stuff, and didn't leave a digital fingerprint.",4,Big Bang Theory,167,30
19545,Sheldon,19, Oh! There isn't enough camomile tea in the world to quell the rage in my heart.,4,Big Bang Theory,80,16
19546,Raj,19," Hold on. I'm talking to an orc under the bridge in Thunder Bluff who says if we pay him, he'll help us track down your things.",4,Big Bang Theory,127,26
19547,Sheldon,19, Can we trust him?,4,Big Bang Theory,18,4
19548,Raj,19," I should say so, he appears to be a member of the Nigerian royal family.",4,Big Bang Theory,73,15
19549,Howard,19, Whoa! Somebody's auctioning off a jewelled ostrich bridle!,4,Big Bang Theory,59,8
19550,Sheldon,19," No. Glenn's was leather. He was a simple ostrich. Is! Is, I haven't given up hope.",4,Big Bang Theory,83,16
19551,Penny,19, Hey.,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
19552,Leonard,19," Hey, Penny. We're kind of in the middle of a crisis, here.",4,Big Bang Theory,59,12
19553,Penny,19," Oh, I know. Bernadette told me. Sorry, Sheldon. I know that game meant a lot to you.",4,Big Bang Theory,85,17
19554,Sheldon,19," That game? Excuse me, Penny, but Doodle Jump is a game. Angry Birds is a game. World of Warcraft is a massively multi-player online role-playing all right, technically it's a game.",4,Big Bang Theory,181,31
19555,Raj,19," Bad news, the Nigerian prince may be a fraud.",4,Big Bang Theory,46,9
19556,Penny,19," Okay, well, anyways, I brought you a day-old cheesecake to cheer you up!",4,Big Bang Theory,73,13
19557,Sheldon,19, Stale pastry is hollow succour to a man who is bereft of ostrich.,4,Big Bang Theory,66,13
19558,Penny,19, Just say thank you.,4,Big Bang Theory,20,4
19559,Sheldon,19, I thought I just did.,4,Big Bang Theory,22,5
19560,Penny,19, All right. See you later.,4,Big Bang Theory,26,5
19562,Penny,19," Oh, hi! I was just dropping off a cheesecake to Sheldon. He was robbed of a bunch of imaginary crap that's useful in a make-believe place.",4,Big Bang Theory,139,26
19564,Penny,19," Yeah, well, sadly, I do.",4,Big Bang Theory,25,5
19566,Penny,19, Did you know last weekend Priya took Leonard rollerblading at the beach? Can you believe that?,4,Big Bang Theory,95,16
19568,Penny,19," I am the one who spent two years trying to get him to even go to the beach in the first place. And he was so phobic about stepping on medical waste, I had to carry him to the water.",4,Big Bang Theory,182,40
19570,Penny,19, So what's the thanks I get for turning Leonard into quality boyfriend material? I have to tiptoe around his new girlfriend.,4,Big Bang Theory,124,21
19571,Amy,19, I think you're on.,4,Big Bang Theory,19,4
19573,Penny,19, Want some coffee liqueur on your ice cream?,4,Big Bang Theory,44,8
19574,Amy,19," Ah, here's the alcohol and drug peer pressure Mother warned me about. I was starting to think it was never going to happen. Yes, please.",4,Big Bang Theory,137,25
19575,Penny,19," You guys should've seen Leonard when I first met him. There was no eye contact. He was either looking up at the ceiling, or down at his shoes.",4,Big Bang Theory,143,28
19576,Amy,19, I'm drunk.,4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
19577,Penny,19," You know, for the first couple of months, whenever I would take off my bra, he would giggle and say, oh boy, my breast friends.",4,Big Bang Theory,128,25
19579,Penny,19," No, don't do that. No reason to be mean to her.",4,Big Bang Theory,48,11
19580,Amy,19," This may be the alcohol talking, but I believe there is. Are you familiar with the recent study of Tanzanian chimpanzees by Nishida and Hosaka out of Kyoto University?",4,Big Bang Theory,168,29
19581,Penny,19," No, but I can name all the Kardashians.",4,Big Bang Theory,40,8
19582,Amy,19," Primates, such as ourselves, have a natural instinct to ostracize ill-mannered members of the troop. Bernadette's urge to shun, scowl or fling her waste at Priya is hard-wired into her DNA.",4,Big Bang Theory,190,31
19584,Amy,19," Believe me, it's there, we all have it. Hit me with some more booze, and I'll show you.",4,Big Bang Theory,88,18
19586,Howard,19," All right, here we are, this is the tavern where all the black-market weapon trades go down.",4,Big Bang Theory,93,17
19587,Raj,19, I don't think my character should be in a place like this. Everyone's undressing her with their eyes.,4,Big Bang Theory,102,18
19588,Howard,19, Maybe if you stop dropping your sword and bending over to pick it up.,4,Big Bang Theory,70,14
19589,Leonard,19," Okay, what exactly are we looking for?",4,Big Bang Theory,39,7
19590,Howard,19," Redheaded troll, goes by the name of Glumly. According to the message boards, if you want to move stolen goods and it's after school hours, he's your guy.",4,Big Bang Theory,155,28
19592,Leonard,19," Uh, we are. In the meantime, you're welcome to whip up a quick character and join us.",4,Big Bang Theory,86,17
19594,Leonard,19," Well, you have to put in a credit card number, but it's fun.",4,Big Bang Theory,61,13
19596,Howard,19, Our troll just walked in! I got him!,4,Big Bang Theory,37,8
19597,Leonard,19, We got him. We're almost done.,4,Big Bang Theory,31,6
19598,Howard,19," So, how do you guys want to play this?",4,Big Bang Theory,39,9
19599,Sheldon,19," Be ruthless. You tell him if he doesn't start talking, we'll register a complaint with his Internet service provider.",4,Big Bang Theory,118,19
19600,Raj,19," Sheldon, what if he gets his Internet from his cable company? He could lose his HBO and all their delightful original programming.",4,Big Bang Theory,131,22
19601,Sheldon,19," I don't care! I'm losin' it, man!",4,Big Bang Theory,34,7
19602,Leonard,19," Why don't we play this smart? Try a little good goblin, bad goblin.",4,Big Bang Theory,68,13
19604,Howard,19," Nah, I think we have to be more subtle.",4,Big Bang Theory,40,9
19605,Raj,19," Okay, I see where this is going. Fine, I'll have sex with him.",4,Big Bang Theory,63,13
19606,Leonard,19, That's not where it was going.,4,Big Bang Theory,31,6
19607,Raj,19," Good, because I would hate that.",4,Big Bang Theory,33,6
19609,Leonard,19," Oh, wait. Hang on. Are you upset?",4,Big Bang Theory,34,7
19611,Leonard,19," Good, good. I'll tell you what happens.",4,Big Bang Theory,40,7
19612,Sheldon,19, And people think I don't get sarcasm.,4,Big Bang Theory,38,7
19614,Amy,19," Well, well, well. Look who it is.",4,Big Bang Theory,34,7
19615,Penny,19," Okay, be nice.",4,Big Bang Theory,15,3
19617,Penny,19, Hi. We're just heading out for a drink.,4,Big Bang Theory,40,8
19618,Amy,19, Because I do that now.,4,Big Bang Theory,23,5
19621,Penny,19," Don't listen to her, she's had a lot of ice cream. Do you want to join us?",4,Big Bang Theory,75,17
19623,Amy,19," Four women walk down the stairs, how many reach the lobby?",4,Big Bang Theory,59,11
19625,Leonard,19, Did your sister say anything when you got home last night?,4,Big Bang Theory,59,11
19626,Raj,19," Oh, no, don't put me in the middle of this. I'm not going to be your go-between.",4,Big Bang Theory,81,17
19627,Leonard,19," Come on, help me out. Am I in trouble?",4,Big Bang Theory,39,9
19628,Raj,19, There's no reason to worry.,4,Big Bang Theory,28,5
19629,Leonard,19, That's a relief.,4,Big Bang Theory,17,3
19630,Raj,19, I'm sure many women in happy relationships spend their nights skyping with their ex-boyfriend Sanjay.,4,Big Bang Theory,102,15
19631,Howard,19," Good news, gentlemen, I found our hacker.",4,Big Bang Theory,42,7
19632,Sheldon,19, What?,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
19633,Leonard,19, Really?,4,Big Bang Theory,8,1
19634,Howard,19," Yeah. No one can hide from me, not Waldo, not Carmen San Diego, not even topless Natalie Portman.",4,Big Bang Theory,98,18
19635,Sheldon,19," I've never said these words before, but good job, Howard!",4,Big Bang Theory,58,10
19636,Howard,19," Thanks. Our culprit is one Mr. Todd Zarnecki, 2711 Ocean View Road, Carlsbad, California.",4,Big Bang Theory,90,14
19637,Sheldon,19, The name and the address drip with evil.,4,Big Bang Theory,41,8
19638,Raj,19, What else do we know about him?,4,Big Bang Theory,32,7
19639,Howard,19," Well, quite a bit, actually.",4,Big Bang Theory,29,5
19640,Leonard,19, I'll bet he's some loser who lives with his parents.,4,Big Bang Theory,53,10
19641,Howard,19," Yes, he does live with his parents. Here's a Google Earth shot of their house.",4,Big Bang Theory,79,15
19642,Sheldon,19, Excellent! It's in a cul-de-sac. We can box him in.,4,Big Bang Theory,52,10
19643,Leonard,19," Hold on, you're thinking of going there?",4,Big Bang Theory,41,7
19644,Sheldon,19, Carlsbad is only a couple of hours away.,4,Big Bang Theory,41,8
19645,Leonard,19," Fine. You walk up to the house, knock on the door and demand your stuff back. What if he says no?",4,Big Bang Theory,98,21
19646,Sheldon,19," I don't know if you've been following the news, Leonard, but there have been some terrific advancements in the field of torture.",4,Big Bang Theory,129,22
19647,Leonard,19, No one's getting tortured.,4,Big Bang Theory,27,4
19648,Sheldon,19," Fine, we'll abide by the Geneva Convention. But ask yourself this, in the course of our lives, how much lunch money has been taken from us? How many kites? How many Scooby-Doo Trapper Keepers?",4,Big Bang Theory,193,34
19649,Raj,19, I totally had one of those.,4,Big Bang Theory,28,6
19650,Sheldon,19," Of course you did. It was a fun and practical way of organizing your school work. But the bullies took it from us. Well, no more. Tonight, we take back our dignity, our birthright and our pride. What do you say? Who's with me?",4,Big Bang Theory,227,44
19651,Raj,19," I have a hip-hop aerobics class at five, could we go after?",4,Big Bang Theory,60,12
19652,Sheldon,19, Sure.,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
19653,Howard,19," Also, tonight's the Sabbath and my mother and I have a tradition of lighting the candles and",4,Big Bang Theory,93,17
19654,Sheldon,19, Fine. Leonard?,4,Big Bang Theory,15,2
19655,Leonard,19," Oh, geez, I don't know if I can ditch Priya two nights in a row.",4,Big Bang Theory,65,15
19656,Raj,19," Oh, come on, man. Bros before my sister.",4,Big Bang Theory,41,8
19657,Leonard,19," Aw, screw it. I'm in.",4,Big Bang Theory,22,5
19658,Raj,19," Me, too.",4,Big Bang Theory,9,2
19659,Howard,19, And me.,4,Big Bang Theory,8,2
19660,Sheldon,19," One moment.  I'm hell-bent on catching a cyber criminal, not the common cold.",4,Big Bang Theory,78,13
19662,Sheldon,19," I'm sorry, I thought this delay was so you could watch Wheel of Fortune with your mother.",4,Big Bang Theory,90,17
19663,Howard,19," I am. She's just bleaching her moustache. Check it out. Hey, Ma! Before and After! Four words, 17 letters, two N's, one V.",4,Big Bang Theory,123,23
19665,Leonard,19, That's incredible.,4,Big Bang Theory,19,2
19666,Howard,19," Yeah, she's kind of a Wheel savant.",4,Big Bang Theory,36,7
19667,Leonard,19," Uh-oh, that's Priya.",4,Big Bang Theory,21,3
19668,Raj,19," Sitar music for her ringtone is not cool, dude.",4,Big Bang Theory,48,9
19669,Leonard,19," Hit the Hey, sweetie. Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm gonna be working late. I, I, I miss you, too. Okay, sure, I'll call you when I get home. Okay, bye-bye.",4,Big Bang Theory,147,29
19670,Raj,19, Very nice. You lie to my sister.,4,Big Bang Theory,33,7
19671,Howard,19, That's the nicest thing he does to your sister.,4,Big Bang Theory,48,9
19672,Raj,19," Oh, guess who.",4,Big Bang Theory,15,3
19673,Leonard,19, Cover for me.,4,Big Bang Theory,14,3
19674,Raj,19," Hello, Priya. What's up? How would I know if Leonard's at work or not? Don't be suspicious. Look, if you want your relationship with Leonard to continue, you're going to have to believe whatever wild-eyed, cockamamie excuse the white devil has the nerve to offer you. Okay? Yeah, bye-bye. You owe me.",4,Big Bang Theory,301,52
19675,Howard,19," New puzzle, Ma. Same name. One N, two D's, three O's.",4,Big Bang Theory,54,11
19677,Sheldon,19, That's uncanny.,4,Big Bang Theory,16,2
19678,Howard,19," I know. It's her superpower. Well, that and jiggling her arm fat.",4,Big Bang Theory,66,12
19680,Leonard,19, I can't believe we're going all the way to San Diego to confront this guy.,4,Big Bang Theory,75,15
19681,Howard,19," Yeah, we're kind of bad-asses, aren't we?",4,Big Bang Theory,42,7
19682,Leonard,19, Totally.,4,Big Bang Theory,9,1
19683,Raj,19," Hey, how about we stay the night and hit Legoland in the morning?",4,Big Bang Theory,66,13
19684,Sheldon,19," Sea World is better. It has Shamu, who is literally tons of fun. But for the moment, let's stay focused on Todd Zarnecki.",4,Big Bang Theory,122,23
19685,Raj,19," Yeah, we're coming for you, Todd Zarnecki. And for the record, Legoland is more interactive.",4,Big Bang Theory,93,15
19686,Sheldon,19," I almost feel sorry for the poor fool, sitting in his split-level suburban ranch, unaware that a vengeful horde is barrelling down the San Diego Freeway at 71 miles an hour. Ease up there, lead foot. You trying to get us killed?",4,Big Bang Theory,229,42
19687,Raj,19, I took the liberty of burning us a mix of heroic questing music.,4,Big Bang Theory,65,13
19688,Sheldon,19, This says Beyonce Bootylicious Dance Mix.,4,Big Bang Theory,42,6
19689,Raj,19, It's a re-writable CD. Just put it in.,4,Big Bang Theory,39,8
19690,Howard,19, Beyonce? Really?,4,Big Bang Theory,17,2
19691,Raj,19, She's curvy and she owns it. I like that.,4,Big Bang Theory,42,9
19692,Leonard,19," Oh, yeah, I'm feeling it.",4,Big Bang Theory,26,5
19693,Sheldon,19, We are winged fury! Which is still no excuse for going over the posted speed limit.,4,Big Bang Theory,84,16
19695,Howard,19," Next time we go to kick someone's ass, we take the train.",4,Big Bang Theory,58,12
19696,Sheldon,19, I always prefer the train.,4,Big Bang Theory,27,5
19698,Leonard,19," Sheldon, let's go.",4,Big Bang Theory,19,3
19699,Sheldon,19, Coming.,4,Big Bang Theory,8,1
19700,Howard,19, Why did you bring that?,4,Big Bang Theory,24,5
19701,Sheldon,19, No weapon strikes more fear into a man's heart than a Klingon bat'leth.,4,Big Bang Theory,72,13
19702,Leonard,19," Okay, let's get clear on something. We're just going to tell this guy to transfer all of your stuff back into your account and then be on our way. No one's bat'lething anybody.",4,Big Bang Theory,177,33
19703,Sheldon,19, So my blade shall not taste blood tonight?,4,Big Bang Theory,43,8
19704,Leonard,19, No.,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
19705,Sheldon,19," Well, now I just feel silly holding it.",4,Big Bang Theory,40,8
19706,Leonard,19, Come on.,4,Big Bang Theory,9,2
19707,Sheldon,19, Can I at least kick down the door?,4,Big Bang Theory,35,8
19708,Leonard,19," You're welcome to try, but the other day, it took you 15 minutes to get into a FedEx box. ",4,Big Bang Theory,91,19
19710,Sheldon,19, Your doom!,4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
19711,Raj,19, Don't say your doom. Who opens the door for their doom?,4,Big Bang Theory,56,11
19712,Sheldon,19, Good point. Basket of puppies.,4,Big Bang Theory,31,5
19714,Leonard,19," Uh, Sheldon?",4,Big Bang Theory,13,2
19715,Sheldon,19, Are you Todd Zarnecki?,4,Big Bang Theory,23,4
19717,Sheldon,19, I am Sheldor of Azeroth. I want my things back.,4,Big Bang Theory,48,10
19719,Sheldon,19, Careful. That's a collectible.,4,Big Bang Theory,31,4
19721,Sheldon,19," Well, he's even more cunning than we thought.",4,Big Bang Theory,46,8
19723,Sheldon,19," You know, the joke's on him. Without the certificate of authenticity, that bat'leth is worthless.",4,Big Bang Theory,98,15
19724,Howard,19," Yeah, he walked right into our trap.",4,Big Bang Theory,37,7
19725,Raj,19, Legoland seems like a hollow dream now.,4,Big Bang Theory,40,7
19726,Leonard,19, Oh-oh.,4,Big Bang Theory,7,1
19727,Raj,19, What's the matter?,4,Big Bang Theory,19,3
19728,Leonard,19," Something's wrong, I'm not getting any gas. Anybody know anything about internal combustion engines?",4,Big Bang Theory,101,14
19729,Sheldon,19, Of course.,4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
19730,Raj,19, Very basic.,4,Big Bang Theory,12,2
19731,Howard,19, 19th-century technology.,4,Big Bang Theory,25,2
19732,Leonard,19, Does anybody know how to fix an internal combustion engine?,4,Big Bang Theory,60,10
19733,Sheldon,19, No.,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
19734,Howard,19," No, not a clue.",4,Big Bang Theory,16,4
19735,Leonard,19," Well, we'd better call somebody to come pick us up.",4,Big Bang Theory,52,10
19736,Sheldon,19, It'd be swell if they had a train.,4,Big Bang Theory,35,8
19738,Sheldon,19," Thank you, Penny.",4,Big Bang Theory,18,3
19739,Penny,19," No problem. So, Leonard, I think it's interesting you didn't call your girlfriend to come get you.",4,Big Bang Theory,99,17
19740,Leonard,19," Uh, I kind of told her I was working.",4,Big Bang Theory,38,9
19741,Penny,19, So you lied to her. Also interesting.,4,Big Bang Theory,38,7
19742,Leonard,19," Yeah, she doesn't really understand the whole Warcraft adventure-role-playing thing.",4,Big Bang Theory,85,10
19743,Penny,19," Well, doesn't matter if she gets it, as long as she's pretty.",4,Big Bang Theory,62,12
19744,Howard,19," This one's funny, Leonard. How come you couldn't make it work with her?",4,Big Bang Theory,72,13
19745,Penny,19, So did you at least get Sheldon's fake stuff back?,4,Big Bang Theory,51,10
19746,Sheldon,19, No. We failed in our noble quest.,4,Big Bang Theory,34,7
19747,Penny,19, How come?,4,Big Bang Theory,10,2
19748,Sheldon,19, Todd Zarnecki was mean.,4,Big Bang Theory,24,4
19749,Penny,19, All right. Hang on.,4,Big Bang Theory,20,4
19750,Leonard,19, What are you doing?,4,Big Bang Theory,20,4
19751,Penny,19, I'm gonna show you how we finish a quest in Nebraska. Oh. Beyonce.  This ain't no Beyonce.,4,Big Bang Theory,91,17
19754,Penny,19, Give my friend his stuff back.,4,Big Bang Theory,31,6
19756,Penny,19," Well, then, good news. Today's the day a girl's finally going to touch you in your little special place.  Now give him his stuff back.",4,Big Bang Theory,135,25
19758,Sheldon,19," We did it! I said, we.",4,Big Bang Theory,23,6
19761,Penny,19," Oh, hi.",4,Big Bang Theory,8,2
19763,Penny,19, Going to see Leonard?,4,Big Bang Theory,22,4
19765,Penny,19, Fine. You?,4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
19767,Penny,19," Alright, well great seeing you.",4,Big Bang Theory,32,5
19769,Penny,19, Amy's right. I do want to fling my poop at her.,4,Big Bang Theory,48,11
19772,Sheldon,20, Hysterical.,4,Big Bang Theory,12,1
19773,Amy,20," I'm glad you talked me into this. We work so hard, sometimes, it's nice to goof off and do something silly.",4,Big Bang Theory,108,21
19774,Sheldon,20, Agreed. Wait till you hear how he dumbs down Werner Heisenberg for the crowd. You may actually believe you're in a comedy club.,4,Big Bang Theory,128,23
19776,Sheldon,20, Ba-dum-bump.,4,Big Bang Theory,13,1
19777,Amy,20," Say, I heard an interesting tidbit about Howard and Bernadette.",4,Big Bang Theory,64,10
19778,Sheldon,20," Really, Amy? Gossip? I'm disappointed in you.",4,Big Bang Theory,46,7
19779,Amy,20," Now, now. Evolutionary biologist Robin Dunbar has identified gossip as an aid to social bonding in large groups.",4,Big Bang Theory,113,18
19780,Sheldon,20," Forgive my language, but poppycock.",4,Big Bang Theory,36,5
19781,Amy,20," What if he's right? And by not participating in gossip, society breaks down into small feral bands of tattooed motorcycle riders fighting to the death over the last few cans of tuna fish?",4,Big Bang Theory,188,33
19782,Sheldon,20," Fine. In the parlance of the urban music scene, what's the 4-1-1?",4,Big Bang Theory,66,12
19783,Amy,20, Bernadette is thinking about breaking up with Howard.,4,Big Bang Theory,54,8
19784,Sheldon,20," I believe our nation's tuna cans are safe. Excuse me. Dr. Greene, question?",4,Big Bang Theory,76,13
19786,Sheldon,20, You've dedicated your life's work to educating the general populace about complex scientific ideas.,4,Big Bang Theory,100,14
19788,Sheldon,20," Have you ever considered trying to do something useful? Perhaps, reading to the elderly?",4,Big Bang Theory,89,14
19790,Sheldon,20," Yeah, but not your books. Something they might enjoy. I kid, of course. Big fan.",4,Big Bang Theory,81,15
19792,Leonard,20, Nice shot.,4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
19793,Sheldon,20, Thank you. My father taught me archery as a child. It's odd how the activity brings back the smell of Kmart bourbon.,4,Big Bang Theory,117,22
19794,Leonard,20, Perfect.,4,Big Bang Theory,9,1
19795,Sheldon,20," I know. What an elf I would have made. Whoo, what do you think you're doing?",4,Big Bang Theory,77,16
19796,Leonard,20, Shooting at a target?,4,Big Bang Theory,22,4
19797,Sheldon,20, With what?,4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
19798,Leonard,20, An arrow.,4,Big Bang Theory,10,2
19799,Sheldon,20, Really? I didn't see you draw one from your quiver.,4,Big Bang Theory,52,10
19800,Leonard,20," I'm not going to do that, Sheldon.",4,Big Bang Theory,35,7
19801,Sheldon,20," Leonard, the people at Nintendo can only go so far in helping us recreate an actual athletic experience. We have to do our part, too.  That was uncalled for, but I'll play along. Ow! I had an unusual experience with Amy last night.",4,Big Bang Theory,232,43
19802,Leonard,20, Really? How could you tell?,4,Big Bang Theory,28,5
19803,Sheldon,20, She was attempting to engage me in gossip.,4,Big Bang Theory,43,8
19804,Leonard,20, You don't say?,4,Big Bang Theory,15,3
19805,Sheldon,20, Yes. I think prolonged exposure to Penny has turned her into a bit of a Gabby Gertie.,4,Big Bang Theory,86,17
19806,Leonard,20," So, what's the gossip?",4,Big Bang Theory,23,4
19807,Sheldon,20," Oh, please, I was just pointing it out. I have no desire to engage in the activity.",4,Big Bang Theory,84,17
19808,Leonard,20," Fine, don't tell me.",4,Big Bang Theory,21,4
19809,Sheldon,20," All right, get this. Bernadette is thinking about breaking up with Howard.",4,Big Bang Theory,75,12
19810,Leonard,20, Oh. That's too bad. I wonder what happened.,4,Big Bang Theory,44,8
19811,Sheldon,20," Mm, it's hard to say. I can only speculate based on the data I collected watching my parents' marriage implode. In that case, the woman dives into religion, while the man dives into a bottle-blonde bartender who tries to buy my love with action figures. Oop! Out of arrows.",4,Big Bang Theory,274,49
19812,Leonard,20," Boy, you sure get your money's worth out of these games.",4,Big Bang Theory,57,11
19814,Leonard,20," â€“ Priya, can I come in?",4,Big Bang Theory,26,6
19816,Leonard,20," Oh, God.",4,Big Bang Theory,9,2
19818,Leonard,20, It's okay. You didn't know. I'll take care of it.,4,Big Bang Theory,50,10
19820,Leonard,20, Sheldon doesn't allow flossing that close to the mirror.,4,Big Bang Theory,57,9
19822,Leonard,20, It's a splatter thing. There's a little piece of tape on the floor you're supposed to stand behind.,4,Big Bang Theory,100,18
19824,Leonard,20," I know. Just do it. There's a big inspection coming up, and I don't want to lose my TV privileges.",4,Big Bang Theory,99,20
19826,Leonard,20," Mm, I don't know. I get a lawyer, he gets a lawyer, it's just easier to stand behind the tape.",4,Big Bang Theory,95,20
19828,Leonard,20," Yeah! Dodgers are baseball, right?",4,Big Bang Theory,35,5
19830,Leonard,20," Mm, it's complicated, but as I remember it, the essentials are, get chosen last, get hit by the ball, cry, go home.",4,Big Bang Theory,116,22
19832,Leonard,20," Well, it might not be a great idea to invite those two.",4,Big Bang Theory,56,12
19834,Leonard,20," Don't tell anybody I told you, but I heard she might be breaking up with him.",4,Big Bang Theory,78,16
19836,Leonard,20, Really? Who?,4,Big Bang Theory,13,2
19838,Leonard,20, What? You're kidding!,4,Big Bang Theory,22,3
19840,Leonard,20," Wow, that's hard to believe.",4,Big Bang Theory,29,5
19842,Leonard,20," Oh, that one doesn't apply to you. You sit.",4,Big Bang Theory,44,9
19844,Leonard,20, Hey!,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
19845,Penny,20, Hey! How's it going?,4,Big Bang Theory,21,4
19846,Leonard,20, Not too bad. Did you hear about Howard and Bernadette?,4,Big Bang Theory,55,10
19847,Penny,20, â€˜Course I heard about it. How did you hear about it?,4,Big Bang Theory,55,11
19848,Leonard,20, I heard about it from Sheldon. He got it from Amy.,4,Big Bang Theory,51,11
19849,Penny,20," Oh, damn it. I told Amy that in the strictest confidence. Boy, some people are such blabbermouths. Well, whatever, I'm sure Bernadette can do better.",4,Big Bang Theory,150,25
19850,Leonard,20, Do you think a sexually ambivalent Indian astrophysicist with selective mutism and alcohol issues is better than a hundred-pound Jewish guy who lives with his mom?,4,Big Bang Theory,164,26
19851,Penny,20, You are kidding. Raj likes Bernadette?,4,Big Bang Theory,39,6
19852,Leonard,20, I didn't say Raj. Who said Raj?,4,Big Bang Theory,32,7
19853,Penny,20," Okay, give. How do you know? Did he tell you?",4,Big Bang Theory,46,10
19854,Leonard,20, No.,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
19855,Penny,20," Well, then who?",4,Big Bang Theory,16,3
19856,Leonard,20, I can't say.,4,Big Bang Theory,13,3
19857,Penny,20," Priya told you. What a little gossip. You know, not an attractive quality in a woman, Leonard. Not judging, just my opinion.",4,Big Bang Theory,125,22
19858,Leonard,20," Well, The point is, if this got out, it would destroy Howard and Raj's friendship.",4,Big Bang Theory,83,15
19859,Penny,20," You don't have to worry. Unlike Amy and Priya, I know how to keep a secret.",4,Big Bang Theory,76,16
19860,Leonard,20, You're the one who told Amy in the first place.,4,Big Bang Theory,48,10
19861,Penny,20, In confidence!,4,Big Bang Theory,15,2
19863,Raj,20," Hello, Mummy. Hello, Daddy. How are you?",4,Big Bang Theory,41,7
19868,Raj,20," I am making her comfortable. Besides, she's not sleeping here half the time anyway.",4,Big Bang Theory,84,14
19873,Raj,20," It, it doesn't matter. Howard has a girlfriend.",4,Big Bang Theory,48,8
19875,Raj,20, What does that mean?,4,Big Bang Theory,21,4
19877,Raj,20, Is something going on with him and Bernadette?,4,Big Bang Theory,47,8
19883,Raj,20," Don't worry. Everything I have, I share with her. Including my friend Leon",4,Big Bang Theory,75,13
19885,Raj,20," Oh, my God, I think you broke my toe!",4,Big Bang Theory,38,9
19887,Raj,20," Fair enough. Now, what's up with Clarinet? Bernadette!",4,Big Bang Theory,55,8
19889,Sheldon,20, I've been thinking about Dr. Greene's efforts to make science palatable for the masses.,4,Big Bang Theory,88,14
19890,Leonard,20," Oh, yeah? What about it?",4,Big Bang Theory,25,5
19891,Sheldon,20," That's all. I've just been thinking about it. Now, I'm thinking about fractal equations. Now I'm thinking about the origin of the phrase train of thought. Now I'm thinking about trains.",4,Big Bang Theory,186,31
19892,Raj,20, Are you listening to this guy?,4,Big Bang Theory,31,6
19893,Howard,20," Hmm? Oh, I'm sorry. I was somewhere else.",4,Big Bang Theory,42,8
19894,Leonard,20, Lucky bastard.,4,Big Bang Theory,15,2
19895,Sheldon,20, Now I'm thinking about Jell-O.,4,Big Bang Theory,31,5
19896,Raj,20, So what's up?,4,Big Bang Theory,14,3
19897,Howard,20, It's a Bernadette thing.,4,Big Bang Theory,25,4
19898,Raj,20," Oh, no. I hope everything's okay.",4,Big Bang Theory,34,6
19899,Leonard,20," Whatever it is, we're here for you. You can tell us anything.",4,Big Bang Theory,62,12
19900,Raj,20, Yeah. Good or devastating.,4,Big Bang Theory,27,4
19901,Howard,20, I'm gonna ask her to marry me.,4,Big Bang Theory,31,7
19902,Leonard,20, Marry you?,4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
19903,Raj,20, What?,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
19904,Howard,20, Yeah. I just need to figure out the right time to pop the question.,4,Big Bang Theory,68,14
19905,Leonard,20," Oh, I'd wait.",4,Big Bang Theory,14,3
19906,Raj,20," No rush, no rush.",4,Big Bang Theory,18,4
19907,Howard,20," Oh, great. It's my cousin David about the ring. Hey, David, what'd you find? Oh, sure, a half a carat's fine. Her freakishly small hands make anything look big. It's one of the reasons I love her.",4,Big Bang Theory,197,37
19908,Leonard,20," Man, he's going to be blindsided.",4,Big Bang Theory,34,6
19909,Raj,20, I know. It'll be awful.,4,Big Bang Theory,24,5
19910,Sheldon,20, Why are you smiling?,4,Big Bang Theory,21,4
19911,Leonard,20," Yeah, Raj, why?",4,Big Bang Theory,16,3
19912,Raj,20," Uh, a smile means something different in my country. You know, tears of joy, smile of sadness. India's a goofy place.",4,Big Bang Theory,118,21
19913,Sheldon,20," Oh, I'm back to trains. Woo-woo.",4,Big Bang Theory,33,6
19915,Amy,20, Did I tell you our lab got a grant to study addiction?,4,Big Bang Theory,55,12
19916,Sheldon,20, No.,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
19917,Amy,20, Fascinating work. I recently trained a capuchin monkey to smoke cigarettes.,4,Big Bang Theory,76,11
19918,Sheldon,20, Have you learned anything?,4,Big Bang Theory,27,4
19919,Amy,20, Yes. He looks much cooler than the non-smoking monkeys. Although it's not much of a contest. The other monkeys just sit around and masturbate.,4,Big Bang Theory,143,24
19920,Sheldon,20," If you don't mind, I'd like to stop listening to you and start talking.",4,Big Bang Theory,72,14
19921,Amy,20, By all means.,4,Big Bang Theory,14,3
19922,Sheldon,20, Howard has announced his intention to propose marriage to Bernadette.,4,Big Bang Theory,70,10
19923,Amy,20, I don't understand. The original piece of gossip indicated an impending breakup.,4,Big Bang Theory,81,12
19924,Sheldon,20," I know. The group consensus is that his proposal will be met with an humiliating, soul-crushing rejection. Everyone was set a-twitter. Although oddly, no one tweeted.",4,Big Bang Theory,167,26
19925,Amy,20, It's not surprising that the story has captured the attention of our little circle of friends. Are you familiar with meme theory?,4,Big Bang Theory,130,22
19926,Sheldon,20," I'm familiar with everything, but go on.",4,Big Bang Theory,41,7
19927,Amy,20, Meme theory suggests that items of gossip are like living things that seek to reproduce using humans as their host.,4,Big Bang Theory,116,20
19928,Sheldon,20," I'm no stranger to memetic epidemiology. At Johnson Elementary School, the phrase Shelly Cooper's a smelly pooper spread like wildfire.",4,Big Bang Theory,136,20
19929,Amy,20, I should think so. That's gold.,4,Big Bang Theory,32,6
19930,Sheldon,20, Your meme hypothesis does intrigue me. How might we examine this more closely?,4,Big Bang Theory,79,13
19931,Amy,20, Do you have any ethical qualms regarding human experimentation?,4,Big Bang Theory,64,9
19932,Sheldon,20, It's one of the few forms of interaction with people that I don't find repellent.,4,Big Bang Theory,82,15
19933,Amy,20, We need to fabricate a tantalizing piece of gossip.,4,Big Bang Theory,52,9
19934,Sheldon,20, And a second non-tantalizing piece to use as a control.,4,Big Bang Theory,56,10
19935,Amy,20," Then we'll track its progress through our social group and interpret the results through the competing academic prisms of memetic theory, algebraic gossip and epidemiology.",4,Big Bang Theory,173,25
19936,Sheldon,20," Look at you, getting me to engage in the social sciences. You're a vixen, Amy Farrah Fowler.",4,Big Bang Theory,93,17
19938,Penny,20," Oh, hey, Amy. What's up?",4,Big Bang Theory,25,5
19939,Amy,20," Sheldon and I engaged in sexual intercourse. In other news, I'm thinking of starting an herb garden. Mum's the word. Gotta go.",4,Big Bang Theory,127,22
19942,Raj,20," I just felt like drinking alone, because I'm deep and dark.",4,Big Bang Theory,60,11
19944,Raj,20, No. It's just one of those times when it's just you and me. Like when the three of us went to the movies and you and I waited outside the bathroom while Howard threw up Red Vines and Cherry Coke. Do you remember that?,4,Big Bang Theory,218,44
19946,Raj,20," Me, too. Good times.",4,Big Bang Theory,21,4
19947,Penny,20," Hey, 16 wants to order appetizers.",4,Big Bang Theory,35,6
19949,Raj,20, This was nice.,4,Big Bang Theory,15,3
19950,Penny,20," What the hell are you doing? Howard is your best friend, and that is his girlfriend. You should be ashamed of yourself.",4,Big Bang Theory,120,22
19951,Raj,20," I was when I came in, but it's amazing what liquor does to guilt. Besides what you might not know is, Bernadette is planning on breaking up with Howard.",4,Big Bang Theory,153,29
19952,Penny,20," Well, I know that. How do you know that?",4,Big Bang Theory,41,9
19953,Raj,20, My sister told me.,4,Big Bang Theory,19,4
19954,Penny,20," Oh, that gossipy bitch! No offense.",4,Big Bang Theory,36,6
19955,Raj,20, None taken. You should hear how she talks about you.,4,Big Bang Theory,53,10
19956,Penny,20," Okay, listen, just because Howard and Bernadette are having problems, does not mean you should be here sniffing around.",4,Big Bang Theory,120,19
19957,Raj,20, What can I do? I can't stop thinking about her.,4,Big Bang Theory,48,10
19958,Penny,20," All right, try thinking about this. Sheldon and Amy had sex.",4,Big Bang Theory,61,11
19959,Raj,20, Shut your ass!,4,Big Bang Theory,15,3
19960,Penny,20," Yeah, it's true. Amy told me.",4,Big Bang Theory,30,6
19961,Raj,20, How did that even happen? Did they know that's what they were doing when they were doing it?,4,Big Bang Theory,93,18
19962,Penny,20, I-I guess they just figured it out at some point.,4,Big Bang Theory,50,10
19963,Raj,20, Wow. I can't believe old Smelly Pooper finally got laid.,4,Big Bang Theory,57,10
19965,Leonard,20, Hey.,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
19966,Sheldon,20, Hey.,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
19967,Leonard,20, Hope you're hungry.,4,Big Bang Theory,20,3
19968,Sheldon,20," Interesting. A friendly sentiment in this country, cruel taunt in the Sudan. It's a lesson in context.",4,Big Bang Theory,103,17
19969,Leonard,20, Will Amy be joining us for dinner?,4,Big Bang Theory,35,7
19970,Sheldon,20," Yes, I believe so.",4,Big Bang Theory,19,4
19971,Leonard,20," Good, good. Everything okay between you two?",4,Big Bang Theory,45,7
19972,Sheldon,20, Yes. Why do you ask?,4,Big Bang Theory,21,5
19973,Leonard,20," No reason. I was just talking to Raj, and he mentioned what a lovely glow she has these days.",4,Big Bang Theory,94,19
19974,Sheldon,20," Did he mean as if she'd been out in the sun, tending an herb garden without wearing a hat or sunblock?",4,Big Bang Theory,103,21
19975,Leonard,20, No. That's not what he meant.,4,Big Bang Theory,30,6
19976,Sheldon,20," Well, we may never know. As my mother would say, the Asians are an inscrutable folk. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have work to do.",4,Big Bang Theory,130,26
19977,Leonard,20," Yeah, you do. You dog, you.",4,Big Bang Theory,28,6
19978,Sheldon,20, Did you get that?,4,Big Bang Theory,18,4
19979,Amy,20, Every word. Our false gossip meme appears to have reached node lambda.,4,Big Bang Theory,71,12
19980,Sheldon,20, This is moving faster than we thought.,4,Big Bang Theory,39,7
19981,Amy,20, Agreed. It appears the rate of gossip transmission is proportional to the number of nodes squared.,4,Big Bang Theory,99,16
19982,Sheldon,20," I must say, Amy, pretending to have intercourse with you is giving me a great deal of satisfaction.",4,Big Bang Theory,100,18
19983,Amy,20," Slow down, Sheldon. I'm not quite there yet.",4,Big Bang Theory,45,8
19985,Leonard,20, Pass the soy sauce.,4,Big Bang Theory,20,4
19986,Howard,20, Sure.,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
19987,Amy,20, Bernadette just asked about my sexual encounter with you. The meme has reached full penetration.,4,Big Bang Theory,97,15
19988,Sheldon,20, Pun intended?,4,Big Bang Theory,14,2
19989,Amy,20, No. Happy accident.,4,Big Bang Theory,20,3
19990,Sheldon,20, This is remarkable. Took less than 24 hours.,4,Big Bang Theory,45,8
19991,Amy,20, I should let you know that she asked for details about our dalliance.,4,Big Bang Theory,70,13
19992,Sheldon,20," Interesting. So it went beyond the mere fact of coitus to a blow by blow, as it were.",4,Big Bang Theory,86,18
19993,Amy,20, Pun intended?,4,Big Bang Theory,14,2
19994,Sheldon,20, I'm sorry. What pun?,4,Big Bang Theory,21,4
19995,Amy,20," Not important. I described your lovemaking as aloof, but effective.",4,Big Bang Theory,68,10
19996,Sheldon,20," I wish you hadn't done that. That's going to make me a chick magnet, and I'm so busy as it is.",4,Big Bang Theory,95,21
19997,Howard,20," Hey, everybody, I got something I want to ask Bernadette, and I can't think of a better time than when I'm with all my friends.",4,Big Bang Theory,128,25
19998,Leonard,20," Oh, hold on, Howard. There's lots of better times.",4,Big Bang Theory,51,9
19999,Raj,20," Leonard, please. The man is talking. Let him get it out, and let the chips fall where they may.",4,Big Bang Theory,96,19
20000,Howard,20, Thank you. Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski,4,Big Bang Theory,43,5
20002,Howard,20," I know things haven't been perfect with us, and we've had our problems, but I just have to tell you, from the moment I",4,Big Bang Theory,119,24
20004,Raj,20, This is it.,4,Big Bang Theory,12,3
20006,Howard,20," Yes, what?",4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
20008,Howard,20, You will?,4,Big Bang Theory,10,2
20009,Raj,20, You will?,4,Big Bang Theory,10,2
20011,Howard,20," Oh, I love you so much.",4,Big Bang Theory,24,6
20013,Leonard,20, Congratulations!,4,Big Bang Theory,17,1
20015,Amy,20, I wonder what changed her mind.,4,Big Bang Theory,32,6
20016,Sheldon,20, Perhaps your talk of my sexual prowess renewed her faith in love.,4,Big Bang Theory,66,12
20017,Amy,20, As good an explanation as any.,4,Big Bang Theory,31,6
20018,Leonard,20, That's great.,4,Big Bang Theory,14,2
20020,Penny,20," Oh, hey, Amy. Bernadette just texted me. Howard proposed?",4,Big Bang Theory,58,9
20021,Amy,20," Yes, not important. Just stopped by to let you know I'm getting orthotics. Also, I'm carrying Sheldon's baby. Mum's the word.",4,Big Bang Theory,126,21
20023,Leonard,20, You're pregnant?,4,Big Bang Theory,17,2
20024,Amy,20, Wow. Is there anything on there about orthotics?,4,Big Bang Theory,49,8
20026,Sheldon,21," Leonard, are you in the shower?",4,Big Bang Theory,32,6
20027,Leonard,21," I can't hear you, I'm in the shower.",4,Big Bang Theory,37,8
20028,Sheldon,21," I asked if you were in the shower, but that's moot now.",4,Big Bang Theory,56,12
20029,Leonard,21, What?,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
20030,Sheldon,21, Moot. Rendered unimportant by recent events.,4,Big Bang Theory,45,6
20031,Leonard,21," I can't hear you, I'm in the shower.",4,Big Bang Theory,37,8
20032,Sheldon,21, I have to skip the chitchat. Emergency.,4,Big Bang Theory,40,7
20033,Leonard,21, What kind of emergency?,4,Big Bang Theory,24,4
20034,Sheldon,21," Mathematical. 32-ounce banana smoothie, 16-ounce bladder.",4,Big Bang Theory,58,6
20035,Leonard,21, You might not want to do that.,4,Big Bang Theory,31,7
20036,Sheldon,21, I assure you I do.,4,Big Bang Theory,19,5
20037,Leonard,21," Sheldon, I'm not alone in here.",4,Big Bang Theory,32,6
20038,Sheldon,21, What?,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
20040,Sheldon,21, What are you doing in there? She can't be in here.,4,Big Bang Theory,51,11
20041,Leonard,21," We were in here first, you can't be in here.",4,Big Bang Theory,45,10
20042,Sheldon,21," According to the roommate agreement, paragraph nine, subsection B, the right to bathroom privacy is suspended in the event of force majeure. And believe me, I am experiencing a very majeure force.",4,Big Bang Theory,197,32
20043,Sheldon,21," Come on, you can't wait two minutes?",4,Big Bang Theory,37,7
20046,Sheldon,21,  Penny?  Penny?  Penny?,4,Big Bang Theory,24,3
20047,Penny,21, What?,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
20048,Sheldon,21, Move. Move. Move!,4,Big Bang Theory,18,3
20050,Sheldon,21," Dr. Leonard Hofstadter, you are officially charged with two violations of the roommate agreement. Do you waive reading of the charges?",4,Big Bang Theory,135,21
20051,Leonard,21," Yeah, fine.",4,Big Bang Theory,12,2
20053,Leonard,21, Oh. Cool. I've got a lawyer. And I've seen her naked.,4,Big Bang Theory,54,11
20055,Sheldon,21," Very well. Count the first, on or about the 28th day of April, the accused did knowingly and with malice aforethought deny access to the shared bathroom in a time of emergency, to wit, my back teeth were floating. Count the second, the accused exceeded the agreed upon occupancy of the shower, to wit, one, unless we are under attack by water-soluble aliens.",4,Big Bang Theory,359,63
20057,Sheldon,21," Um, it's fairly technical.",4,Big Bang Theory,27,4
20059,Leonard,21," Top of her class, Cambridge University. Licensed to practice law in three countries. And your face.",4,Big Bang Theory,100,16
20061,Sheldon,21," Do so, do so.",4,Big Bang Theory,14,4
20063,Sheldon,21," Oh, that's ridiculous. A bathroom emergency is self-explanatory.",4,Big Bang Theory,65,8
20065,Sheldon,21, Irrelevant. Leonard doesn't trim his nose hair. He thinks because he's short nobody can see up there.,4,Big Bang Theory,102,17
20067,Sheldon,21, But,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
20069,Leonard,21, Schooled!,4,Big Bang Theory,10,1
20071,Leonard,21, Superceded!,4,Big Bang Theory,12,1
20072,Sheldon,21, This isn't over.,4,Big Bang Theory,17,3
20073,Leonard,21," No offence, but shower sex with you is now the second best thing that's happened today.",4,Big Bang Theory,88,16
20075,Raj,21," Mmm, Greek food on pizza night? This is the most delightfully cruel thing we've done to Sheldon since we left that fake message from Stephen Hawking on his voice mail.",4,Big Bang Theory,168,30
20077,Sheldon,21, What is that you're eating? Tonight is pizza night.,4,Big Bang Theory,52,9
20078,Leonard,21, I'd like to refer that to my attorney.,4,Big Bang Theory,39,8
20080,Sheldon,21," Yes, and when Franconi's went out of business, we switched to Graziano's.",4,Big Bang Theory,74,12
20081,Howard,21," That's interesting. Can you just switch restaurants like that, Priya?",4,Big Bang Theory,70,10
20083,Sheldon,21, No.,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
20085,Sheldon,21," This is Greek food? Leonard, you hate Greek food.",4,Big Bang Theory,50,9
20086,Leonard,21, Not as much as you.,4,Big Bang Theory,20,5
20087,Sheldon,21, Fine. I'm nothing if not adaptable.,4,Big Bang Theory,36,6
20088,Leonard,21, I got you the lamb kabob.,4,Big Bang Theory,26,6
20089,Sheldon,21," Thank you. If you think about it, Greek food isn't that far from italian food. They share a spice palette. And what a civilization is the Greeks. They gave us science, democracy, and little cubes of charred meat that taste like sweat.",4,Big Bang Theory,235,42
20091,Sheldon,21,  Penny?  Penny?  Penny?,4,Big Bang Theory,24,3
20092,Penny,21, Hey. What's up?,4,Big Bang Theory,16,3
20093,Sheldon,21, The mean Indian lady tried to make me eat lamb. Congratulations. Pizza night will now be at your apartment. Order one.,4,Big Bang Theory,119,21
20094,Penny,21," Oh, I'm sorry, honey, I'm meeting Amy and Bernadette for dinner. But you're welcome to tag along.",4,Big Bang Theory,98,17
20095,Sheldon,21," A girls night? Oh, I don't know if I'm up for an evening talking about rainbows, unicorns and menstrual cramps.",4,Big Bang Theory,112,20
20096,Penny,21," Okay, suit yourself. We'll probably be trashing Priya a little.",4,Big Bang Theory,64,10
20097,Sheldon,21, Shotgun.,4,Big Bang Theory,9,1
20099,Penny,21," Okay, I'd like to propose a toast to a wonderful girls night out.",4,Big Bang Theory,66,13
20100,Amy,21," Fair warning, we can get ker-razy.",4,Big Bang Theory,35,6
20102,Sheldon,21," Really, Amy? Tobacco and alcohol? Need I remind you not a lot of scientific discoveries were made by people having a good time?",4,Big Bang Theory,128,23
20103,Amy,21, Why did you bring him? He's harshing my buzz.,4,Big Bang Theory,46,9
20104,Penny,21, I felt sorry for him. Priya's giving him a hard time.,4,Big Bang Theory,54,11
20106,Amy,21, I need some context.,4,Big Bang Theory,21,4
20107,Penny,21, Pantsuits suck.,4,Big Bang Theory,16,2
20108,Amy,21," And that opens her up To justifiable ridicule for wearing them. Good one, Bernadette. See? Ker-razy.",4,Big Bang Theory,101,16
20111,Amy,21, You smell like baby powder.,4,Big Bang Theory,28,5
20112,Sheldon,21," It's talc. But as that's a primary ingredient of baby powder, I understand your confusion.",4,Big Bang Theory,91,15
20113,Amy,21," Oh, I'm not confused at all. You're like a sexy toddler.",4,Big Bang Theory,57,11
20114,Sheldon,21, I don't know how to process that.,4,Big Bang Theory,34,7
20116,Penny,21, That's too many S's for kissing.,4,Big Bang Theory,33,6
20118,Penny,21," Sheldon, have you ever kissed a girl?",4,Big Bang Theory,38,7
20119,Sheldon,21," Other than my mother, my sister and my mee-maw, no. But in the interest of full disclosure, I was once on a bus and had to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to an elderly nun who passed out from heat exhaustion. Every year I get a Christmas card from her, signed with far too many X's and O's.",4,Big Bang Theory,294,56
20121,Penny,21," Yeah, you're a scientist, where is the curiosity?",4,Big Bang Theory,50,8
20122,Amy,21, I'm available for experimentation.,4,Big Bang Theory,35,4
20123,Sheldon,21, Thank you. Not necessary. We know everything there is to know about kissing. It requires 34 facial muscles and 112 postural muscles.,4,Big Bang Theory,133,22
20124,Amy,21," Oh, blah, blah, blah. Give me some sugar, bestie .",4,Big Bang Theory,51,10
20125,Sheldon,21, I'm certainly glad no one said they were curious about Aztec human sacrifice.,4,Big Bang Theory,78,13
20126,Penny,21," Hey, I know, let's take Sheldon dancing.",4,Big Bang Theory,41,7
20128,Sheldon,21," No, thank you, but for the record, I'm an excellent dancer. Proficient in the rumba, waltz and cha-cha.",4,Big Bang Theory,104,18
20129,Amy,21, Really?,4,Big Bang Theory,8,1
20130,Sheldon,21, I don't see why that's surprising. I excel at so many things. You've had my sourdough bread.,4,Big Bang Theory,93,17
20131,Penny,21, Did you take dance lessons?,4,Big Bang Theory,28,5
20132,Sheldon,21," Against my will. In the South, pre-adolescent children are forced through a process called cotillion, which indoctrinates them with all the social graces and dance skills needed to function in 18th century Vienna.",4,Big Bang Theory,214,33
20133,Penny,21," Oh, we are so taking you dancing.",4,Big Bang Theory,34,7
20134,Sheldon,21," No, you most certainly are not.",4,Big Bang Theory,32,6
20136,Sheldon,21, I saved a nun's life. Why am I being punished?,4,Big Bang Theory,47,10
20138,Penny,21, Take us to a place we can waltz.,4,Big Bang Theory,33,8
20140,Sheldon,21," Waltz. It's a social dance from Austria, choreographed to a three-four time signature. ",4,Big Bang Theory,88,13
20142,Amy,21," I kissed a girl and I liked it, I hope my boyfriend don't mind it.",4,Big Bang Theory,67,15
20143,Sheldon,21, What happened to you?,4,Big Bang Theory,22,4
20145,Penny,21," Shake it baby, shake it!",4,Big Bang Theory,25,5
20150,Penny,21," Oh, what the hell. Ooh!",4,Big Bang Theory,24,5
20152,Amy,21," How come if we're the smart people, we don't do this every night?",4,Big Bang Theory,66,13
20153,Sheldon,21, What's 16 times 14?,4,Big Bang Theory,20,4
20154,Amy,21, My burps taste like cranberry juice.,4,Big Bang Theory,37,6
20155,Sheldon,21, And there's your answer.,4,Big Bang Theory,25,4
20156,Amy,21, Would you like to come in for a nightcap?,4,Big Bang Theory,42,9
20157,Sheldon,21," If you're referring to the beverage, you know I don't drink. If you're referring to the hat you don while wearing a nightshirt and holding a candle, I have one.",4,Big Bang Theory,161,30
20158,Amy,21, I have yoo-hoo.,4,Big Bang Theory,16,3
20159,Sheldon,21, It's hard to say no to yoo-hoo. The name literally beckons.,4,Big Bang Theory,60,11
20160,Amy,21, Make yourself comfortable.,4,Big Bang Theory,27,3
20161,Sheldon,21, Thank you. Is someone smoking?,4,Big Bang Theory,31,5
20162,Amy,21," Oh, that's just Ricky.",4,Big Bang Theory,23,4
20163,Sheldon,21, You own a smoking monkey?,4,Big Bang Theory,26,5
20164,Amy,21, Don't be silly. He's one of the animals in my department's nicotine addiction study.,4,Big Bang Theory,85,14
20165,Sheldon,21, What's he doing here?,4,Big Bang Theory,22,4
20166,Amy,21, I'm giving him emphysema. The least I can do is let him hang out and watch cable.,4,Big Bang Theory,82,17
20167,Sheldon,21, Remarkable. Aren't you worried about secondhand smoke?,4,Big Bang Theory,55,7
20168,Amy,21, A little. The real danger is him biting my face off while I'm sleeping.,4,Big Bang Theory,72,14
20169,Sheldon,21, is he deliberately blowing smoke at me?,4,Big Bang Theory,40,7
20170,Amy,21, Yeah. He's kind of an ass.,4,Big Bang Theory,27,6
20171,Sheldon,21, Thank you. May I share something with you that's troubling me?,4,Big Bang Theory,63,11
20172,Amy,21, Of course. What's rattling around that big bulbous brain of yours?,4,Big Bang Theory,67,11
20173,Sheldon,21," Priya has essentially nullified my roommate agreement with Leonard, making life in the apartment very uncomfortable for me.",4,Big Bang Theory,124,18
20174,Amy,21, And you want me to kill her? Done.,4,Big Bang Theory,35,8
20175,Sheldon,21," No, of course not.",4,Big Bang Theory,19,4
20176,Amy,21, I trained Ricky how to smoke. I can train him to shoot a poison dart. No jury would convict us 'cause people love monkeys.,4,Big Bang Theory,123,24
20177,Sheldon,21," I understand the alcohol has stirred up whatever it is that makes girls go wild, but I really need to talk to smart Amy now.",4,Big Bang Theory,125,25
20178,Amy,21, Excuse me. Have you considered that your intelligence might be the very thing causing your dilemma?,4,Big Bang Theory,100,16
20179,Sheldon,21, No.,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
20180,Amy,21, What do you think Ricky over here would do if an interloper encroached on his territory?,4,Big Bang Theory,89,16
20181,Sheldon,21," Well, when challenged, monkeys generally assert their dominance through chasing, assault and a stylized penile display. That's a little outside my comfort zone.",4,Big Bang Theory,161,23
20182,Amy,21," You're being too literal. My point is, he would not meekly surrender to the rules, and neither should you.",4,Big Bang Theory,107,19
20183,Sheldon,21, Are you suggesting I play dirty?,4,Big Bang Theory,33,6
20184,Amy,21," Yes, dirty. Dirty, dirty, dirty. Which brings me to our next order of business. ",4,Big Bang Theory,81,14
20185,Sheldon,21, Fascinating.,4,Big Bang Theory,13,1
20186,Amy,21, I hope you don't take what I'm about to do as a comment on what we just did. ,4,Big Bang Theory,78,18
20187,Sheldon,21, Who's to say you shouldn't be dissecting our brains? You really are an ass.,4,Big Bang Theory,76,14
20189,Leonard,21," Morning, Sheldon.",4,Big Bang Theory,18,2
20190,Sheldon,21," Oh, good, you're up. I've written a new and improved roommate agreement that benefits me greatly. I'd like you to sign it.",4,Big Bang Theory,123,22
20191,Leonard,21, Why would I want to do that?,4,Big Bang Theory,29,7
20192,Sheldon,21," Excellent question. Do you remember what happened to the alien, played by talented character actor Frank Gorshin, in the Star Trek episode Let That Be Your Last Battlefield?",4,Big Bang Theory,174,28
20193,Leonard,21," Uh, Captain Kirk activated the self-destruct sequence and threatened to blow up the Enterpriseand kill them both unless he gave in?",4,Big Bang Theory,132,21
20194,Sheldon,21," Affirmative. Computer, this is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Activate self-destruct sequence. Code 1-1-A-2-B.",4,Big Bang Theory,100,12
20196,Leonard,21," What are you gonna do, Sheldon, blow up the apartment?",4,Big Bang Theory,55,10
20197,Sheldon,21," That was my first thought, but all my cool stuff is here.",4,Big Bang Theory,58,12
20199,Sheldon,21," Unless Leonard signs the new agreement in the next 41 seconds, this computer will send an e-mail to your parents in India saying that you're in a secret relationship with the whiter-than-marshmallow-fluff Leonard Hofstadter.",4,Big Bang Theory,225,34
20201,Leonard,21, What's the big deal?,4,Big Bang Theory,21,4
20203,Leonard,21," They're gonna find out about me eventually, right?",4,Big Bang Theory,51,8
20205,Sheldon,21, 20 seconds.,4,Big Bang Theory,12,2
20206,Leonard,21, Are you ashamed of me?,4,Big Bang Theory,23,5
20208,Leonard,21, Then why can't we tell your parents?,4,Big Bang Theory,37,7
20210,Sheldon,21," He does that all the time, doesn't he? 15.",4,Big Bang Theory,43,9
20212,Leonard,21," No, he's bluffing.",4,Big Bang Theory,19,3
20213,Sheldon,21, I never bluff. Ten.,4,Big Bang Theory,20,4
20214,Leonard,21, It's blackmail!,4,Big Bang Theory,16,2
20215,Sheldon,21, Nine.,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
20217,Sheldon,21, Eight.,4,Big Bang Theory,7,1
20218,Leonard,21, This is ridiculous. ,4,Big Bang Theory,21,3
20219,Sheldon,21," It's a laptop with a full charge. Honestly, what do you see in him?",4,Big Bang Theory,68,14
20221,Sheldon,21, Three.,4,Big Bang Theory,7,1
20222,Leonard,21, Really?,4,Big Bang Theory,8,1
20223,Sheldon,21, Two.,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
20224,Leonard,21," Okay, I'll sign it!",4,Big Bang Theory,20,4
20226,Sheldon,21," You may have gone to Cambridge, but I'm an honorary graduate of Starfleet academy.",4,Big Bang Theory,83,14
20228,Sheldon,21," Good morning, Amy.",4,Big Bang Theory,19,3
20229,Amy,21, It most assuredly is not.,4,Big Bang Theory,26,5
20230,Sheldon,21," Are you experiencing dehydration, headache, nausea and shame?",4,Big Bang Theory,62,8
20231,Amy,21, Yes. I also found a Korean man's business card tucked into my cleavage. What happened last night?,4,Big Bang Theory,98,17
20232,Sheldon,21," Ah, memory impairment, the free prize at the bottom of every vodka bottle.",4,Big Bang Theory,75,13
20233,Amy,21, Sheldon?,4,Big Bang Theory,9,1
20234,Sheldon,21," All right. Last night you gave me some excellent advice regarding my problem here at home, you kissed me and then vomited on and off for 40 minutes, following which you passed out on your bathroom floor. I then folded a towel under your head as a pillow, set your oven clock to the correct time because it was driving me crazy, and I left.",4,Big Bang Theory,340,65
20235,Amy,21, Okay. Don't really know where we go from here.,4,Big Bang Theory,47,9
20236,Sheldon,21, I suggest we treat our relationship as if it were a crashed computer and restore it to the last point we both agree it worked.,4,Big Bang Theory,127,25
20237,Amy,21, Terrific. Thank you.  They were out of menthols! Get off my back! Not easy living with a temperamental little primate.,4,Big Bang Theory,119,20
20238,Leonard,21," Come on, Priya, just admit I embarrass you!",4,Big Bang Theory,44,8
20239,Sheldon,21," You're preaching to the choir, sister.",4,Big Bang Theory,39,6
20241,Amy,22," I must say, Penny, this is great fun.",4,Big Bang Theory,38,8
20242,Penny,22, Glad you're enjoying yourself.,4,Big Bang Theory,31,4
20243,Amy,22," Until I met you and Bernadette, my trips to the bathroom had been entirely focused on elimination. Now they have a delightful social aspect.",4,Big Bang Theory,141,24
20245,Amy,22, Of course I have. But they were strangers and seemed off-put when I engaged in friendly stall-to-stall chit-chat.,4,Big Bang Theory,114,18
20247,Amy,22," You okay in there, bestie?",4,Big Bang Theory,27,5
20248,Penny,22, I'm fine.,4,Big Bang Theory,10,2
20249,Amy,22," The reason I ask is that many people experience bladder shyness, the inability to pass urine",4,Big Bang Theory,93,16
20250,Penny,22," Yeah, I said I'm fine. Stop talking to me.",4,Big Bang Theory,43,9
20251,Amy,22, She always this crabby when she urinates?,4,Big Bang Theory,42,7
20253,Penny,22, Screw it. I'll go later.,4,Big Bang Theory,25,5
20254,Amy,22, And I'll be right by your side.,4,Big Bang Theory,32,7
20257,Penny,22," Oh, that's nice.",4,Big Bang Theory,17,3
20258,Amy,22," No, it's not. It's a strategic manoeuvre. Leonard's new girlfriend is testing Bernadette's loyalty to you and the group. That bitch is crafty.",4,Big Bang Theory,143,23
20260,Amy,22, Of course. How does the cheetah attack a herd of wildebeests? By going after its weakest member.,4,Big Bang Theory,97,17
20262,Amy,22, Your trusting nature coupled with your teeny-tiny body. You wouldn't last a minute on the Serengeti.,4,Big Bang Theory,101,16
20263,Penny,22," Okay, Amy, you're being silly. I am not concerned about who hangs out with who. And I certainly don't have a problem with Leonard's new girlfriend who wears way too much makeup. Ooh, these are cute. Of course if I buy them, I'll have to rent my womb out to a gay couple.",4,Big Bang Theory,271,53
20265,Amy,22," Oh, no. You have to go.",4,Big Bang Theory,24,6
20267,Amy,22," You are, with hair that smells like strawberries. And we're going to use that to our advantage.",4,Big Bang Theory,96,17
20268,Penny,22, Wait. What are you talking about?,4,Big Bang Theory,34,6
20269,Amy,22," By accepting the invitation, Bernadette becomes a double agent inside the enemy camp. She could ferret out Priya's tactics, identify her weaknesses and feed her false information, such as, Leonard's no stranger to back-alley cockfights.",4,Big Bang Theory,237,35
20271,Amy,22, Don't worry. I'll teach you. I did two years of Cub Scouts before they found out I was a girl.,4,Big Bang Theory,95,20
20272,Penny,22," Okay, I don't know you people. I'm just an innocent woman wondering if this shoe store will take my Texaco card.",4,Big Bang Theory,113,21
20273,Amy,22, How do you feel about concealing a recording device in the cleavage of your ample bosom?,4,Big Bang Theory,89,16
20275,Amy,22," Come on, Strawberries. Take one for the team.",4,Big Bang Theory,46,8
20276,Leonard,22," Okay, see you later.",4,Big Bang Theory,21,4
20277,Sheldon,22, Good news. I finally have a handle on my idea for three-person chess.,4,Big Bang Theory,70,13
20278,Leonard,22, That is good news. Bye.,4,Big Bang Theory,24,5
20279,Sheldon,22," Uh, do you know how I solved the balanced centre combat-area problem? Five words, transitional quadrilateral to triangular tessellation.",4,Big Bang Theory,137,19
20280,Leonard,22," That, that's brilliant.",4,Big Bang Theory,24,3
20281,Sheldon,22," It's what I do. But wait, there's more. I also invented two new chess pieces. The serpent, and the old woman.",4,Big Bang Theory,110,21
20282,Leonard,22," Okay, now I have to ask. What do they do?",4,Big Bang Theory,42,10
20283,Sheldon,22," When the serpent slithers to an opposing player's piece, that piece is considered poisoned and will die after two more moves. Ugh.",4,Big Bang Theory,131,22
20284,Leonard,22, All right.,4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
20285,Sheldon,22," Unless, it gets to the old woman in time, in which case she sucks out the poison, turning her into the Grand Empress, a piece combining the power of the knight, queen and serpent.",4,Big Bang Theory,180,34
20286,Leonard,22, Elegant.,4,Big Bang Theory,9,1
20287,Sheldon,22, That's because it's simple.,4,Big Bang Theory,28,4
20288,Leonard,22," Okay, well, I look forward to playing with you.",4,Big Bang Theory,48,9
20289,Sheldon,22, And,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
20290,Leonard,22, And what?,4,Big Bang Theory,10,2
20291,Sheldon,22," And a third person. It's three-person chess. I must say, ever since you started having regular intercourse, your mind has lost its keen edge. You should reflect on that.",4,Big Bang Theory,170,29
20292,Leonard,22," Excuse me, but Einstein had a pretty busy sex life.",4,Big Bang Theory,52,10
20293,Sheldon,22," Yes, and he never unified gravity with the other forces. If he hadn't been such a hound dog, we'd all have time machines.",4,Big Bang Theory,122,23
20294,Leonard,22, Got it. Bye.,4,Big Bang Theory,13,3
20295,Sheldon,22, You know I'm right.,4,Big Bang Theory,20,4
20296,Leonard,22, I think he's getting worse.,4,Big Bang Theory,28,5
20297,Amy,22," Oh, my metatarsal are barking.",4,Big Bang Theory,31,5
20298,Leonard,22, You okay?,4,Big Bang Theory,10,2
20299,Amy,22," Yeah, yeah. I'm just breaking in some new shoes.",4,Big Bang Theory,49,9
20300,Leonard,22, Very pretty.,4,Big Bang Theory,13,2
20301,Amy,22, Thank you. Did you know that women wear high heels to make the buttocks and breasts more prominent?,4,Big Bang Theory,100,18
20302,Leonard,22, Hadn't really thought about it.,4,Big Bang Theory,32,5
20303,Amy,22, Look.,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
20304,Leonard,22," Uh, sure. Very prominent.",4,Big Bang Theory,26,4
20305,Amy,22," Please, Leonard, don't leer, you have a girlfriend.",4,Big Bang Theory,52,8
20306,Leonard,22, Sorry.,4,Big Bang Theory,7,1
20307,Amy,22," So, are you off to dinner with Priya, Howard and Bernadette?",4,Big Bang Theory,61,11
20308,Leonard,22, Yeah. How did you know?,4,Big Bang Theory,24,5
20309,Amy,22," I heard it at the mall, when I was shopping with my girlfriends, 'cause, you know, that's kind of my life now. Have a good night. Try not to ogle my caboose as I walk away.",4,Big Bang Theory,173,36
20312,Leonard,22," Hi. Hey, Raj, will you be joining us for dinner?",4,Big Bang Theory,49,10
20313,Raj,22, The lonely guy and the two happy couples? I'd rather get a prostate exam from a leper who walks away with nine fingers.,4,Big Bang Theory,120,23
20315,Raj,22, I have to feel sorry for myself. I'm the only one who cares. Just like I'm the only one who'll have sex with me.,4,Big Bang Theory,113,24
20316,Leonard,22, Really? In front of your sister?,4,Big Bang Theory,33,6
20318,Raj,22," Excuse me. I'm going to go wander the streets alone. Invisible, unwanted and unloved, a pathetic shadow in a city with no heart.  I forgot my windbreaker. It's chilly.",4,Big Bang Theory,168,29
20320,Amy,22, I don't understand. Is this a way to break in new shoes?,4,Big Bang Theory,57,12
20321,Penny,22," No. Once these puppies touch the ground they're mine, and I'll have to wear them walking up and down Hollywood Boulevard in order to pay them off. Pretty, pretty, pretty.",4,Big Bang Theory,171,30
20322,Penny,22, The what?,4,Big Bang Theory,10,2
20323,Amy,22, Bernadette is with Priya and Leonard. Message received. Commence operation â€œPriya Wouldn't Wanna Be-ya.â€ù,4,Big Bang Theory,109,14
20324,Penny,22, Hey. Seriously? Didn't you get enough of this cliquey crap in high school?,4,Big Bang Theory,75,13
20325,Amy,22, I wish. A clique requires friends. I didn't have any.,4,Big Bang Theory,54,10
20326,Penny,22, None?,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
20327,Amy,22, I used to take my lunch down to the maintenance room and eat with the janitor. It was nice until his wife called me a puta and made me stop. Hang on. It's the wildebeest. Priya just made a snide comment about your acting career.,4,Big Bang Theory,229,45
20328,Penny,22, Wh What the hell did she say?,4,Big Bang Theory,30,7
20329,Amy,22," She thinks it's cool you're following your dream, no matter what.",4,Big Bang Theory,66,11
20330,Penny,22, That bitch!,4,Big Bang Theory,12,2
20331,Amy,22, How do you want to handle it?,4,Big Bang Theory,30,7
20332,Penny,22," Um, okay. Tell Bernadette to tell Priya that I'm on my way to Prague to shoot a movie with Angelina Jolie.",4,Big Bang Theory,107,21
20333,Amy,22, Got it. Is it going to be in 3-D?,4,Big Bang Theory,34,9
20334,Penny,22, What? I don't know. It doesn't matter.,4,Big Bang Theory,39,7
20335,Amy,22, I'm gonna say 3-D. That'll let her know the studio has faith in it.,4,Big Bang Theory,68,14
20337,Leonard,22, You're kidding. 3-D?,4,Big Bang Theory,21,3
20339,Howard,22, Then the studio must have real faith in it.,4,Big Bang Theory,44,9
20340,Leonard,22, Wonder why she didn't tell me.,4,Big Bang Theory,31,6
20342,Leonard,22, No.,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
20344,Leonard,22," Well, it's not as much surprised as, uh, uh, you know, uh. th-th-th-the other thing.",4,Big Bang Theory,85,15
20346,Leonard,22," Well, you know, if you, if, if, if you, uh, I don't, oh, what's the word I'm looking for?",4,Big Bang Theory,90,19
20347,Howard,22, I'm not going to help you. This is hilarious.,4,Big Bang Theory,46,9
20351,Leonard,22, Thank you. Befuddled. The word I was looking for was befuddled.,4,Big Bang Theory,64,11
20353,Sheldon,22, Knight to old woman six-and-a-third. Brilliant move. Thank you.  Will the two of you excuse me?,4,Big Bang Theory,96,16
20354,Raj,22, I need a hug.,4,Big Bang Theory,14,4
20355,Sheldon,22," Sorry, I have company.",4,Big Bang Theory,23,4
20356,Raj,22," Come on, Sheldon, open the door.",4,Big Bang Theory,33,6
20357,Sheldon,22, I don't want to hug you.,4,Big Bang Theory,25,6
20358,Raj,22," I don't want to hug you, either. I was just feeling blue.",4,Big Bang Theory,58,12
20359,Sheldon,22," Blue, as in depressed.",4,Big Bang Theory,23,4
20360,Raj,22," Well, not so much depressed as lonely.",4,Big Bang Theory,39,7
20361,Sheldon,22, I don't know what colour lonely is.,4,Big Bang Theory,36,7
20362,Raj,22, What?,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
20363,Sheldon,22," Red is angry, yellow is frightened, green is jealous and blue is depressed. Perhaps we can assign a colour to lonely.",4,Big Bang Theory,118,21
20364,Raj,22, Nothing rhymes with orange. It's probably lonely.,4,Big Bang Theory,50,7
20365,Sheldon,22," All right. Come in. You look positively orange with loneliness. No, I don't see that catching on at all.",4,Big Bang Theory,105,19
20366,Raj,22, What are you doing?,4,Big Bang Theory,20,4
20367,Sheldon,22, I'm working on my three-person chess game.,4,Big Bang Theory,43,7
20368,Raj,22," Oh, cool. Can I play?",4,Big Bang Theory,22,5
20369,Sheldon,22, It's three-person chess. Did you bring a friend?,4,Big Bang Theory,49,8
20370,Raj,22, No.,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
20371,Sheldon,22," Then as a mental exercise I invite you to figure out why the two of us can't play three-person chess. Can you believe this guy? Social protocol does, however, require me to bring you a hot beverage in your time of need.",4,Big Bang Theory,220,42
20372,Raj,22," No, thank you. I'm fine.",4,Big Bang Theory,25,5
20373,Sheldon,22, It's not optional. We're out of tea. I hope you like bouillon.,4,Big Bang Theory,63,12
20374,Raj,22," I, uh, I guess you're probably wondering what's got me down.",4,Big Bang Theory,61,11
20375,Sheldon,22," Actually, I was wondering if I could add a third new chess piece. How do you think people would feel about Prince Joey, the king's feeble-minded but well-meaning cousin?",4,Big Bang Theory,170,29
20376,Raj,22," I'm going to be 30 years old, and I have no one in my life to love me. I'm such a basket case, I can't even talk to a woman without having alcohol in my body.",4,Big Bang Theory,159,36
20377,Sheldon,22," The fun thing about Prince Joey is every time he moves, there's a one-in-five chance he'll kill himself.",4,Big Bang Theory,105,18
20378,Raj,22," Sheldon, listen to me. I have a big decision to make, and I'm scared.",4,Big Bang Theory,70,14
20379,Sheldon,22, Yellow. Go ahead.,4,Big Bang Theory,18,3
20380,Raj,22, A friend at the School of Pharmacology gave me these new pills they're testing. He says it's the next big thing for social anxiety disorder.,4,Big Bang Theory,141,25
20381,Sheldon,22, Fascinating. What's in it?,4,Big Bang Theory,27,4
20382,Raj,22, I'm not sure. Some sort of beta-blocker attached to a molecule extracted from the urine of cows.,4,Big Bang Theory,97,17
20383,Sheldon,22, I like cows.,4,Big Bang Theory,13,3
20384,Raj,22, That's not the point.,4,Big Bang Theory,22,4
20385,Sheldon,22, It was its own point. Go on.,4,Big Bang Theory,29,7
20386,Raj,22," I'm a scientist. My ability to think is my bread and butter. I'm afraid if I take this, I might lose that special, unique something that makes me so successful in my field.",4,Big Bang Theory,173,33
20387,Sheldon,22," Rajesh, I've had the privilege of working alongside you for many years. My recommendation is that you gobble these up like Tic Tacs.",4,Big Bang Theory,133,23
20389,Howard,22," Okay, I'm still trying to work this out. How did Penny meet an astronaut?",4,Big Bang Theory,74,14
20391,Howard,22, Most of those guys live in Texas.,4,Big Bang Theory,34,7
20393,Howard,22, Okay.,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
20395,Howard,22, Fine.,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
20397,Howard,22," I'm not grilling you, I was just curious.",4,Big Bang Theory,42,8
20398,Leonard,22," I still can't get over the fact that she got a big movie part. Not that I care what my ex-girlfriend's up to, 'cause I don't.",4,Big Bang Theory,126,26
20402,Leonard,22, I thought the movie was about 18th-century Vienna?,4,Big Bang Theory,51,8
20404,Howard,22," It's nice to have another couple to hang with, isn't it?",4,Big Bang Theory,57,11
20406,Penny,22," All right, guys, you have to go back. I can't afford you. â€œNo, don't send",4,Big Bang Theory,76,15
20407,Amy,22," Good golly, Penny, your whimsy is boundless.  What do you got for me, wildebeest?",4,Big Bang Theory,82,14
20409,Amy,22," Calm down. Everything's going to be okay.  We may have to kill her. Bernadette, I'm putting you on speakerphone. Where are you now?",4,Big Bang Theory,132,23
20411,Amy,22," Oh, look at this, another one of our classic bathroom gabfests. What's the problem?",4,Big Bang Theory,84,14
20413,Amy,22, Just change the subject.,4,Big Bang Theory,25,4
20415,Penny,22, What?,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
20417,Penny,22," What, are they getting engaged?",4,Big Bang Theory,32,5
20419,Amy,22, What astronaut story?,4,Big Bang Theory,22,3
20421,Amy,22, I texted architect. That's amusing. Auto-correct must've changed it.,4,Big Bang Theory,69,9
20423,Penny,22," All right, look, just forget about the astronaut.",4,Big Bang Theory,50,8
20424,Amy,22, Architect. Where would you have met an astronaut?,4,Big Bang Theory,50,8
20425,Penny,22," Look, just find out what's up with this trip to India.",4,Big Bang Theory,55,11
20427,Penny,22, Don't you quit on us!,4,Big Bang Theory,22,5
20428,Howard,22," Bernie, you okay?",4,Big Bang Theory,18,3
20431,Raj,22," Thank you for coming with me, Sheldon. You're a good friend.",4,Big Bang Theory,61,11
20432,Sheldon,22, I'm glad you think so. That's what I strive to emulate.,4,Big Bang Theory,56,11
20433,Raj,22," Okay, let's see if this drug works.",4,Big Bang Theory,36,7
20435,Raj,22," Forgive me for staring, but you're very beautiful.",4,Big Bang Theory,51,8
20437,Raj,22, India.,4,Big Bang Theory,7,1
20439,Raj,22, It's a beautiful country. You'd love it. May I join you?,4,Big Bang Theory,57,11
20441,Raj,22," My name is Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali, and this is my friend Dr. Sheldon Cooper.",4,Big Bang Theory,78,14
20443,Sheldon,22," Oh, there's no need to interact with me. I'm just here to observe.",4,Big Bang Theory,67,13
20445,Raj,22," We're scientists. We observe everything. Here, go buy yourself a scone.",4,Big Bang Theory,72,11
20446,Sheldon,22, All right.,4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
20447,Raj,22, And what is your name?,4,Big Bang Theory,23,5
20449,Raj,22," Oh, derived from the word angel. Appropriate.",4,Big Bang Theory,46,7
20451,Sheldon,22, I'd like to buy a scone.,4,Big Bang Theory,25,6
20453,Sheldon,22," They sound delicious, but this money is earmarked for scones.",4,Big Bang Theory,62,10
20455,Raj,22," Oh, just getting comfortable. So how long have you lived in Los Angeles?",4,Big Bang Theory,73,13
20457,Sheldon,22, They were out of scones.,4,Big Bang Theory,25,5
20458,Raj,22," Sheldon, I'm talking to someone. You're being rude. I'll bet you're an actress. If not, you should be. You have a very expressive face.",4,Big Bang Theory,136,24
20460,Raj,22," Wait, where are you going? We were doing so well. She never even got to see my penis. Ta-da!",4,Big Bang Theory,93,19
20463,Leonard,22," Thanks, yeah.",4,Big Bang Theory,14,2
20464,Howard,22, Sure.,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
20466,Howard,22, Nice to see that the gals are getting along.,4,Big Bang Theory,45,9
20467,Leonard,22," Gals? Who are you, Fred Flintstone?",4,Big Bang Theory,36,6
20481,Howard,22," Okay, well, it's getting late. This was terrific. You win. Bernie?",4,Big Bang Theory,67,11
20482,Leonard,22, I think the word you're looking for is befuddled.,4,Big Bang Theory,50,9
20484,Sheldon,22, My catapult flings my bishop to Howard's Queen's Gorilla two.,4,Big Bang Theory,62,10
20485,Howard,22," Nice. Okay, rook to transporter pad. And he comes out at Leonard's Queen's Bishop",4,Big Bang Theory,82,14
20486,Leonard,22, Hang on. When is my pawn allowed to use the golf cart?,4,Big Bang Theory,55,12
20487,Sheldon,22, When it's done charging. Or you land on the time machine. Obviously.,4,Big Bang Theory,69,12
20488,Leonard,22," Oh, oh, Beekeeper to King 12. I capture your Pope and release the swarm. Checkmate on Sheldon.",4,Big Bang Theory,95,17
20489,Sheldon,22, I knew I should have given my Pope the jet pack.,4,Big Bang Theory,49,11
20490,Raj,22," Hey, I've got winners.",4,Big Bang Theory,23,4
20492,Penny,23," Hey, do me a favour and take table seven.",4,Big Bang Theory,42,9
20494,Penny,23," Nah, I prefer to look at it as the one with my ex-boyfriend and his gorgeous, successful and sophisticated girlfriend, who makes me feel like a toothless Okie.",4,Big Bang Theory,160,28
20496,Penny,23," Oh, please, you're not that kind of person.",4,Big Bang Theory,44,8
20498,Leonard,23," Uh, that's my water.",4,Big Bang Theory,21,4
20499,Sheldon,23, What?,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
20500,Leonard,23, My water. You're drinking it.,4,Big Bang Theory,30,5
20501,Sheldon,23, Dear Lord! Have you been drinking it?,4,Big Bang Theory,38,7
20502,Leonard,23, Yes. It's my water.,4,Big Bang Theory,20,4
20503,Sheldon,23," Well, that's it then. I'm dead.",4,Big Bang Theory,32,6
20504,Leonard,23, Here we go.,4,Big Bang Theory,12,3
20505,Sheldon,23," I'm sorry, do I really need to connect the dots for you? The backwash into this glass is every pathogen that calls your mouth home, sweet home. Not to mention the visitors who arrive on the dancing tongue of your subtropical girlfriend.",4,Big Bang Theory,237,42
20506,Raj,23," Hey! That's my sister and my country you're talking about. Leonard may have defiled one, but I won't have you talking smack about the other.",4,Big Bang Theory,141,25
20508,Sheldon,23," Yes, I'd like a seven-day course of penicillin, some, uh, syrup of ipecac, to induce vomiting, and a mint.",4,Big Bang Theory,107,19
20510,Howard,23, He drank from Leonard's glass.,4,Big Bang Theory,31,5
20511,Sheldon,23, He drank from Leonard's glass. Words they'll be carving into my tombstone.,4,Big Bang Theory,75,12
20512,Leonard,23, That's actually my napkin.,4,Big Bang Theory,27,4
20513,Sheldon,23," Oh, this is a nightmare!",4,Big Bang Theory,25,5
20514,Howard,23, Where are you going?,4,Big Bang Theory,21,4
20515,Sheldon,23," To the bar, to sterilize my mouth with alcohol. Gang way! Dead man walking!",4,Big Bang Theory,76,14
20522,Howard,23, Nothing soothes those pre-wedding jitters like the thought of falling and drowning.,4,Big Bang Theory,84,12
20523,Leonard,23, What did your mother say when you told her you were getting married?,4,Big Bang Theory,69,13
20525,Howard,23, I was thinking of weaving it into her eulogy.,4,Big Bang Theory,46,9
20527,Howard,23," Hey, have you told your parents you're dating this short glass of skim milk here?",4,Big Bang Theory,82,15
20529,Howard,23," Right, right, whereas Jewish mothers take a casual, la-di-da approach to their sons.",4,Big Bang Theory,85,13
20530,Sheldon,23, I gargled with tequila and may have swallowed a teeny bit.,4,Big Bang Theory,59,11
20531,Leonard,23, You all right?,4,Big Bang Theory,15,3
20532,Sheldon,23, Fine. Thank you for asking. I love you so much.,4,Big Bang Theory,48,10
20534,Sheldon,23, Fire demon.,4,Big Bang Theory,12,2
20535,Raj,23," Ooh, fire demon. Sheldon's turning up the heat.",4,Big Bang Theory,48,8
20536,Howard,23, Troll master.,4,Big Bang Theory,14,2
20537,Raj,23, Check it! Howard pulls one out from under the bridge. Nice!,4,Big Bang Theory,60,11
20538,Leonard,23, Water nymph.,4,Big Bang Theory,13,2
20539,Raj,23," Oh, yeah, she's got puddles in all the right places.",4,Big Bang Theory,53,10
20540,Sheldon,23, Could you please play the game without commenting on every card?,4,Big Bang Theory,65,11
20541,Raj,23, Sorry. Walking tree.,4,Big Bang Theory,21,3
20542,Sheldon,23, Last one.,4,Big Bang Theory,10,2
20543,Raj,23, I'm taking a stroll and I'm sporting wood.,4,Big Bang Theory,43,8
20544,Howard,23," Okay, the Eagle has landed.",4,Big Bang Theory,28,5
20545,Leonard,23, What's going on?,4,Big Bang Theory,17,3
20546,Howard,23, Bernadette and my mother are having a get-to-know-you lunch at the Old Town Deli.,4,Big Bang Theory,82,14
20547,Raj,23," Oh, that sounds lovely.",4,Big Bang Theory,24,4
20548,Howard,23," Hope so. Of course, if history is any indication, my mother will swallow her whole and spit out her bones like an owl.",4,Big Bang Theory,119,23
20549,Leonard,23, Have you met Bernadette's parents?,4,Big Bang Theory,35,5
20550,Howard,23, You mean Adolf and Eva? Not yet. One goose step at a time.,4,Big Bang Theory,59,13
20551,Raj,23," Sheldon, that's my water.",4,Big Bang Theory,26,4
20552,Sheldon,23," Oh, dear Lord!",4,Big Bang Theory,15,3
20553,Leonard,23, That's not your water.,4,Big Bang Theory,23,4
20554,Raj,23, I know.,4,Big Bang Theory,8,2
20555,Sheldon,23, Where's the mouthwash?,4,Big Bang Theory,23,3
20556,Raj,23, Where indeed.,4,Big Bang Theory,14,2
20558,Howard,23," Ma, I'm home! Where are you?",4,Big Bang Theory,29,6
20560,Howard,23," So, how'd it go?",4,Big Bang Theory,17,4
20562,Howard,23," No, I mean lunch, today, with Bernadette.",4,Big Bang Theory,42,7
20564,Howard,23," Besides food, did you get along? Did you talk?",4,Big Bang Theory,47,9
20566,Howard,23," No, she never mentioned it.",4,Big Bang Theory,28,5
20568,Howard,23," Yeah, that's probably it. So, what do you think? Do you like her? She's great, huh?",4,Big Bang Theory,84,16
20570,Howard,23," That's good to hear, 'cause I've got some news.",4,Big Bang Theory,48,9
20572,Howard,23," Bernadette and I are getting married. Ma? You too busy bearing down? Ma?  Oh, my God, Ma? Ma? Ma? Stand back, I'm gonna break the door down!  Son of a bitch! Ma, help!",4,Big Bang Theory,168,33
20574,Penny,23, Hey.,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
20575,Sheldon,23, Hello.,4,Big Bang Theory,7,1
20576,Penny,23, Haven't seen you in a while. How's it going?,4,Big Bang Theory,45,9
20577,Sheldon,23," Oh, other than waiting out the exponential growth period of the virulent organisms trooping through my microvilli into my circulatory system, hunky-dory.  Did I say something amusing?",4,Big Bang Theory,184,27
20578,Penny,23," I don't know, maybe, I have no idea what you said.",4,Big Bang Theory,51,11
20579,Sheldon,23, So your mirth is merely a discharge of nervous energy with no semantic content at all?,4,Big Bang Theory,87,16
20580,Penny,23, My mirth. Classic.,4,Big Bang Theory,19,3
20581,Sheldon,23, Is there a station coming up where I can board your giggling train of thought?,4,Big Bang Theory,79,15
20582,Penny,23," It's not a big deal, Sheldon. It's just, ever since Leonard's been dating Raj's sister, I've had to keep my distance. I don't get to hear all your jibber-jabber.",4,Big Bang Theory,162,29
20583,Sheldon,23, Jibber-jabber? I don't jibber-jabber.,4,Big Bang Theory,38,4
20584,Penny,23, What are you doing at work these days?,4,Big Bang Theory,39,8
20585,Sheldon,23," Oh, I'm working on time-dependent backgrounds in string theory, specifically quantum field theory in D-dimensional de Sitter space.",4,Big Bang Theory,132,18
20586,Penny,23," Alright, come on, even you have to admit that's jibber-jabber.",4,Big Bang Theory,63,10
20587,Sheldon,23," Interesting, do you know where the phrase jibber-jabber comes from?",4,Big Bang Theory,68,10
20588,Penny,23," Oh, my God, you're about to jibber-jabber about jibber-jabber.",4,Big Bang Theory,63,9
20589,Leonard,23," Howard and his mother are at the hospital. Come on, we gotta go.",4,Big Bang Theory,65,13
20590,Penny,23," Oh, my God! What happened?",4,Big Bang Theory,27,5
20591,Leonard,23," I don't know, I just got a text. Come on, hurry.",4,Big Bang Theory,49,11
20592,Penny,23, Okay.,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
20593,Leonard,23," Sheldon, let's go!",4,Big Bang Theory,19,3
20594,Sheldon,23," To a hospital? Full of sick people? Oh, I don't think so.",4,Big Bang Theory,58,12
20595,Penny,23," Okay, well, your friend and his mother are there, we're going.",4,Big Bang Theory,63,11
20596,Sheldon,23, I can't.,4,Big Bang Theory,9,2
20597,Penny,23," Oh, don't tell me you're afraid of germs.",4,Big Bang Theory,42,8
20598,Sheldon,23," Not all germs. Just the ones that will kill me. It's the same way I'm not afraid of all steak knives, just the ones that might be plunged in my thorax.",4,Big Bang Theory,152,31
20599,Leonard,23," Right, fine. I'll tell Howard you didn't come because you're more concerned about your own well-being than his.",4,Big Bang Theory,112,18
20600,Sheldon,23, I would think he would know that.,4,Big Bang Theory,34,7
20601,Penny,23," Okay, you know what? You are unbelievable. You buy all these superhero T-shirts, but when it's time for you to step up and do the right thing, you just hide in the laundry room.",4,Big Bang Theory,178,34
20602,Sheldon,23," Fine, I'll go. Just for the record, my Aunt Ruth died in a hospital. She went in to visit my Uncle Roger, caught something and bit the dust a week later. The two of them now share a coffee can on my mother's mantel.",4,Big Bang Theory,216,44
20604,Howard,23," So I knocked down the bathroom door, picked up my poor unconscious mother, carried her to the car, and drove like a madman to the emergency room.",4,Big Bang Theory,146,27
20606,Howard,23," No, I did what any son would do.",4,Big Bang Theory,33,8
20607,Penny,23," Hang on a second, you picked up your mother? Her own legs are barely able to do that.",4,Big Bang Theory,86,18
20608,Howard,23, I was filled with adrenaline. It happens to be how women lift cars off babies.,4,Big Bang Theory,79,15
20609,Penny,23," Yeah, I'm saying, it'd be easier to lift a car.",4,Big Bang Theory,48,10
20610,Howard,23," What can I tell you? After I found the courage to put her pants back on, I was unstoppable.",4,Big Bang Theory,92,19
20611,Leonard,23," So, how is she?",4,Big Bang Theory,16,4
20612,Howard,23, They're running tests. I don't know. It may have been a heart attack or heart-attack-like event.,4,Big Bang Theory,97,16
20613,Penny,23, What's the difference?,4,Big Bang Theory,23,3
20614,Sheldon,23, A heart-attack-like event is an event that's like a heart attack.,4,Big Bang Theory,66,11
20615,Penny,23, Thanks for clearing that up.,4,Big Bang Theory,29,5
20616,Sheldon,23," Regardless, coronary problems are eminently treatable. What's more likely going to kill Howard's mother are the antibiotic-resistant super-bugs festering in every nook and cranny of this hospital.",4,Big Bang Theory,197,27
20617,Penny,23," Okay, you're not helping.",4,Big Bang Theory,26,4
20618,Sheldon,23, Disagree.,4,Big Bang Theory,10,1
20619,Leonard,23, Go sit over there.,4,Big Bang Theory,19,4
20620,Sheldon,23," I'll sit over there, it looks cleaner.",4,Big Bang Theory,39,7
20621,Leonard,23, Is there a history of heart disease in your family?,4,Big Bang Theory,52,10
20622,Howard,23, My family is the history of heart disease. There's a cave painting in France of one of my ancestors doing this .,4,Big Bang Theory,113,22
20624,Howard,23," Well, maybe. Mom also had just gotten some news that might have upset her.",4,Big Bang Theory,75,14
20626,Howard,23, It's not important.,4,Big Bang Theory,20,3
20628,Howard,23, You'd think that. But no.,4,Big Bang Theory,26,5
20630,Howard,23, You can't take that personally.,4,Big Bang Theory,32,5
20631,Penny,23, How else is she supposed to take it?,4,Big Bang Theory,37,8
20632,Howard,23," What you've got to keep in mind is that ever since my dad left, I've been the whole world to my mother. I mean, she'd be threatened by any woman who can give me what she can't.",4,Big Bang Theory,177,37
20634,Howard,23," Well, when you say it like that you make it sound creepy.",4,Big Bang Theory,58,12
20637,Howard,23," Bernie, wait!",4,Big Bang Theory,14,2
20638,Sheldon,23," I'll give you $1,000 if you'll drive me home.",4,Big Bang Theory,46,9
20641,Penny,23," Well, he's my friend. It's what you do. ",4,Big Bang Theory,41,8
20643,Penny,23," It's just so weird. Howard Wolowitz is my friend. You know, once he tried to stick his tongue down my throat and I broke his nose.",4,Big Bang Theory,131,26
20645,Penny,23," Yeah, tell me about it.",4,Big Bang Theory,24,5
20647,Penny,23, You mean when he was little.,4,Big Bang Theory,29,6
20649,Penny,23," You know, this stuff is horrible. You want to see if we can find the cafeteria and get real coffee?",4,Big Bang Theory,100,20
20651,Leonard,23, I'm fine. That's nice that they're getting along.,4,Big Bang Theory,50,8
20652,Raj,23," Your girlfriend and your ex-girlfriend are hanging out together? Oh, yeah, that can only be good for you.",4,Big Bang Theory,106,18
20653,Leonard,23, What are you talking about?,4,Big Bang Theory,28,5
20654,Raj,23, One of them broke up with you. Do you really want her telling the other one why?,4,Big Bang Theory,81,17
20655,Leonard,23, I don't care. I don't have anything to hide.,4,Big Bang Theory,45,9
20656,Raj,23," Good, good. Then you have nothing to worry about.",4,Big Bang Theory,50,9
20657,Leonard,23," No, I do not. You are a mean little man.",4,Big Bang Theory,41,10
20658,Raj,23," You'd think it'd be because my parents didn't love me, but actually they loved me a great deal.",4,Big Bang Theory,96,18
20659,Howard,23," Bernie, it's not you. She's just set in her ways.",4,Big Bang Theory,50,10
20661,Howard,23," It's the circle of life, sweetie. One day our son will marry someone and it will kill you.",4,Big Bang Theory,91,18
20662,Sheldon,23," Howard, I have to go to the bathroom and no one will take me home.",4,Big Bang Theory,67,15
20663,Howard,23, What's wrong with the bathroom here?,4,Big Bang Theory,37,6
20664,Sheldon,23," Pneumococcus, streptococcus, staphylococcus and other assorted coccuses.",4,Big Bang Theory,73,7
20665,Howard,23," Sheldon, my mother is on her deathbed and my fiancÃ©e is grief-stricken over putting her there. I'm not taking you home.",4,Big Bang Theory,121,21
20666,Sheldon,23," Will you at least go with me to the restroom here, so you can open the door and flush the urinal?",4,Big Bang Theory,98,21
20667,Howard,23, No!,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
20668,Sheldon,23," This might be a good time to point out, Howard, that friendship requires a certain give and take. Hold the door!",4,Big Bang Theory,113,21
20670,Howard,23, Is she okay?,4,Big Bang Theory,13,3
20672,Howard,23, Can I see her?,4,Big Bang Theory,15,4
20675,Howard,23, Jews have been asking that for centuries. There's no real good answer.,4,Big Bang Theory,71,12
20677,Howard,23," Don't worry, you'll be fine. Let's just hide Mr. Cross. If it touches her, it burns.",4,Big Bang Theory,85,16
20679,Howard,23, Yeah.,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
20682,Sheldon,23," Finally.  Oh, what fresh hell is this?",4,Big Bang Theory,39,7
20684,Sheldon,23," No, I haven't. It's all good.",4,Big Bang Theory,30,6
20686,Penny,23," You want to talk about crazy mothers, Leonard's mom wouldn't give him any sort of approval growing up.",4,Big Bang Theory,103,18
20688,Penny,23, It makes him desperate to please women. That's why the foreplay goes on and on.,4,Big Bang Theory,80,15
20690,Penny,23," It's like he's trying to win a prize. A word of advice, don't doze off. You will never hear the end of it.",4,Big Bang Theory,107,23
20691,Sheldon,23, Help me! Come back! Penny!,4,Big Bang Theory,27,5
20693,Leonard,23," There are a couple of things I did with Penny that might be a little silly, but",4,Big Bang Theory,80,17
20694,Raj,23, Like what?,4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
20695,Leonard,23," Every once in a while, before we'd go to bed, I'd put on a little show for her.",4,Big Bang Theory,80,18
20696,Raj,23," What do you mean, a show?",4,Big Bang Theory,26,6
20697,Leonard,23," Well, you know, the way I took my clothes off.",4,Big Bang Theory,47,10
20698,Raj,23," Like, to music?",4,Big Bang Theory,16,3
20699,Leonard,23, I'd look pretty stupid if there was no music.,4,Big Bang Theory,46,9
20700,Raj,23, So you'd do a striptease?,4,Big Bang Theory,26,5
20701,Leonard,23, I wasn't swinging around a pole.,4,Big Bang Theory,33,6
20702,Raj,23," Good, good.",4,Big Bang Theory,12,2
20703,Leonard,23, There was one time I put body glitter on.,4,Big Bang Theory,42,9
20704,Raj,23," Well, I don't think you have to worry about Penny telling my sister that.",4,Big Bang Theory,74,14
20705,Leonard,23," No, she wouldn't.",4,Big Bang Theory,18,3
20706,Raj,23, Your big problem is me telling her.,4,Big Bang Theory,36,7
20707,Leonard,23, You really are a mean little man.,4,Big Bang Theory,34,7
20709,Penny,23," Yeah, I know, right?",4,Big Bang Theory,21,4
20710,Leonard,23," Hey, what took you guys so long?",4,Big Bang Theory,33,7
20712,Leonard,23, That's nice. What about?,4,Big Bang Theory,25,4
20713,Penny,23, We were just comparing notes about how you are in the sack.,4,Big Bang Theory,60,12
20714,Leonard,23, That's funny.,4,Big Bang Theory,14,2
20715,Penny,23, Yeah.,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
20716,Raj,23, What if she wasn't kidding?,4,Big Bang Theory,28,5
20717,Leonard,23, It doesn't matter. I'm the king of foreplay.,4,Big Bang Theory,45,8
20718,Howard,23," Hey, how'd it go?",4,Big Bang Theory,18,4
20720,Howard,23, Yeah. Do you?,4,Big Bang Theory,14,3
20722,Howard,23, And are you?,4,Big Bang Theory,13,3
20724,Howard,23," Well, based on the available evid",4,Big Bang Theory,34,6
20726,Howard,23, Where are you going?,4,Big Bang Theory,21,4
20728,Howard,23," Is it just me, or does she sound sexy when she's angry?",4,Big Bang Theory,56,12
20730,Sheldon,23, Mountain Elf.,4,Big Bang Theory,14,2
20731,Raj,23, He takes the elf from off the shelf.,4,Big Bang Theory,37,8
20732,Leonard,23, Hell Hounds.,4,Big Bang Theory,13,2
20733,Raj,23, Hell Hounds. Who let the Satanic dogs out? Who? Who-who?,4,Big Bang Theory,57,10
20734,Howard,23, Colossal Serpent.,4,Big Bang Theory,18,2
20735,Raj,23, I got a colossal serpent right here.,4,Big Bang Theory,37,7
20736,Sheldon,23, Must you?,4,Big Bang Theory,10,2
20737,Raj,23," Sorry, I'm just trying to cheer my buddy up. Rotting Zombie. Sheldon's new Facebook photo.",4,Big Bang Theory,91,15
20738,Sheldon,23," Zandor, Wizard of the North. Ha! I win.",4,Big Bang Theory,40,8
20739,Howard,23," If you skip the part about being under a two-week quarantine because you were exposed to a deadly disease, absolutely.",4,Big Bang Theory,119,20
20741,Penny,24," Hey, you guys ready to order?",4,Big Bang Theory,30,6
20742,Howard,24, Uh..,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
20743,Leonard,24, Sure,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
20744,Penny,24," Okay, Priya?",4,Big Bang Theory,13,2
20746,Leonard,24," Oh, no, no, no, he doesn't.",4,Big Bang Theory,28,6
20748,Leonard,24," Well, you have milk in the taters, milk in the gravy, parmesan crust. Your lactose-intolerant boyfriend will turn into a gas-filled Macy's Day balloon.",4,Big Bang Theory,152,24
20749,Sheldon,24," Not quite accurate. The Macy's balloons are filled with helium, whereas Leonard produces copious amounts of methane.",4,Big Bang Theory,117,17
20750,Leonard,24," So, no, on the Shepherd's Pie. Can we move on?",4,Big Bang Theory,47,10
20751,Leonard,24, Sea bass. I'll have the sea bass.,4,Big Bang Theory,34,7
20752,Howard,24," You gotta like this, the girlfriend and the ex-girlfriend bonding over your rooty-tooty stinky booty.",4,Big Bang Theory,102,15
20753,Leonard,24, Kill me.,4,Big Bang Theory,9,2
20754,Sheldon,24, It wouldn'help. The human body is capable of being flatulent for hours after death.,4,Big Bang Theory,84,14
20756,Sheldon,24," Bernadette, before you change the subject, does anyone have any final comments on Leonard's faulty digestive system?",4,Big Bang Theory,117,17
20757,Leonard,24," So, what's your news, Bernadette?",4,Big Bang Theory,34,5
20759,Penny,24, Oh!,4,Big Bang Theory,4,1
20760,Sheldon,24," Oh, congratulations.",4,Big Bang Theory,21,2
20761,Penny,24," Wow, so that means you're a doctor, you're a doctor, you're a doctor, you're a doctor, and Howard, you know a lot of doctors.",4,Big Bang Theory,126,24
20762,Howard,24," Congratulations, honey.",4,Big Bang Theory,24,2
20764,Leonard,24," So, Howard, tell us, how's it feel knowing that when you two get married, you'll be referred to as Mr. and Dr. Wolowitz?",4,Big Bang Theory,121,23
20765,Sheldon,24," Unless he takes Bernadette's last name. And considering her advanced status, that could open some doors for him.",4,Big Bang Theory,113,18
20766,Howard,24," Please, this isn't about me. I'm proud of you.",4,Big Bang Theory,47,9
20768,Howard,24, What?,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
20769,Leonard,24," Bernadette, that's great. Howard, do you make a buttload?",4,Big Bang Theory,58,9
20770,Howard,24, Better than what you've got a buttload of.,4,Big Bang Theory,43,8
20771,Leonard,24," Hey, if I roll down the windows in the car, everything's peachy. If you do it, you're still not a doctor.",4,Big Bang Theory,106,21
20772,Penny,24," Yeah, just a heads-up on the car window deal. It helps, but everything is not peachy.",4,Big Bang Theory,86,16
20774,Raj,24," Oh, if there was a problem, you can't solve it, check out the hook while my DJ revolves it. Ice, Ice, baby. Ice, Ice, baby. .",4,Big Bang Theory,126,26
20776,Leonard,24," You look beautiful, Lieutenant Uhura. Now prepare for inspection.",4,Big Bang Theory,66,9
20778,Leonard,24," Relax, he's got headphones on. And we're ten miles above Earth in a starship.",4,Big Bang Theory,78,14
20779,Raj,24," Really, ten miles? You're orbiting inside the atmosphere? Moron.",4,Big Bang Theory,65,9
20781,Leonard,24," I can't believe you think he only wears it on Halloween. Open the landing bay doors, shuttle craft approaching.",4,Big Bang Theory,112,19
20782,Raj,24," Okay, gotta go.",4,Big Bang Theory,16,3
20784,Howard,24," Hey, what's up?",4,Big Bang Theory,16,3
20786,Howard,24," No, Ma! It's Raj!",4,Big Bang Theory,18,4
20788,Howard,24, Yes!,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
20790,Howard,24," Sheldon, yes! Everybody's a doctor but me!",4,Big Bang Theory,43,7
20792,Howard,24, What's up?,4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
20793,Raj,24, Leonard's putting disgusting memories in my memory foam mattress. Can I stay here tonight?,4,Big Bang Theory,91,14
20794,Howard,24," Sure, but I'm going out with Bernadette. It'll just be you and my mother.",4,Big Bang Theory,74,14
20795,Raj,24, I guess that's okay.,4,Big Bang Theory,21,4
20796,Howard,24," Ma, can Rajesh sleep over?!",4,Big Bang Theory,28,5
20798,Raj,24," She's kidding, right?",4,Big Bang Theory,22,3
20799,Howard,24," I don't know, she's pretty feisty since they put her on hormone-replacement therapy.",4,Big Bang Theory,85,13
20802,Sheldon,24," I must say, Amy, I was very impressed to see that Bernadette got her PhD.",4,Big Bang Theory,74,15
20803,Amy,24," It's indeed admirable. Although, it is microbiology.",4,Big Bang Theory,53,7
20804,Sheldon,24, Your doctorate is in neurobiology. I fail to see the distinction.,4,Big Bang Theory,66,11
20805,Amy,24," I'll make it simple for you. I study the brain, the organ responsible for Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. Bernadette studies yeast, the organism responsible for Michelob Lite. Is there something wrong with your neck?",4,Big Bang Theory,213,33
20806,Sheldon,24, It's a little stiff. What a remarkably fragile structure to support such a valuable payload. Not unlike balancing a Faberge egg on a Pixie Stick.,4,Big Bang Theory,146,25
20807,Amy,24, Have you considered massage?,4,Big Bang Theory,29,4
20808,Sheldon,24," I'd like to respond to that sarcastically. Yes, I relish the thought of a stranger covering my body with oil and rubbing it.",4,Big Bang Theory,125,23
20809,Amy,24, I was proposing you massage your muscles with your own hands.,4,Big Bang Theory,62,11
20810,Sheldon,24, Still sounds like a lot of unnecessary touching.,4,Big Bang Theory,49,8
20811,Amy,24," Trust me. With your right hand, locate the spot where the scapula meets the acromion process.",4,Big Bang Theory,94,16
20812,Sheldon,24, All right.,4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
20813,Amy,24," Now push your third finger along the ridge of the shoulder blade, making a small rotation as you do so.",4,Big Bang Theory,104,20
20814,Sheldon,24, Rotating.,4,Big Bang Theory,10,1
20815,Amy,24, You should feel a small node-like object rolling back and forth along the bone.,4,Big Bang Theory,80,14
20816,Sheldon,24, You mean the myofascial point?,4,Big Bang Theory,31,5
20817,Amy,24, Obviously. Now bear down on it like the seventh grade noogies we all know too well.,4,Big Bang Theory,84,16
20818,Sheldon,24," Oh, dear Lord, yes, yes, oh, yes! Amy, I've never been touched like this before! Oh! Oh, my hands are magic!",4,Big Bang Theory,109,21
20819,Amy,24, Don't flatter yourself. Your hands are blunt tools guided by my knowledge of the nervous system. I could just as easily have paralyzed you.,4,Big Bang Theory,140,24
20820,Sheldon,24, There's someone at my door.,4,Big Bang Theory,28,5
20821,Amy,24, That doesn't interest me. Goodbye.,4,Big Bang Theory,35,5
20822,Raj,24, Can I sleep here tonight?,4,Big Bang Theory,26,5
20823,Sheldon,24, Why?,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
20824,Raj,24, Leonard's having astronomically inaccurate Star Trek sex with my sister.,4,Big Bang Theory,73,10
20825,Sheldon,24, I can see how that would be upsetting. Come in. I'll get the sheets and blankets for the couch.,4,Big Bang Theory,96,19
20826,Raj,24," Oh, don't bother. I'll just sleep in Leonard's room.",4,Big Bang Theory,53,9
20827,Sheldon,24," No, I can't authorize that.",4,Big Bang Theory,28,5
20828,Raj,24," Well, he's in my bed. Why can't I be in his?",4,Big Bang Theory,45,11
20829,Sheldon,24," The Hammurabic Code is an eye for an eye, not a bed for a bed.",4,Big Bang Theory,63,15
20830,Raj,24," Come on, dude, I'm exhausted, and Tyra Banks says the most important item in your makeup bag is a good night's sleep.",4,Big Bang Theory,118,22
20831,Sheldon,24," All right. This is a form indemnifying me from your use of Leonard's bedroom. Sign here, indicating that I tried to stop you and did so using a stern facial expression.",4,Big Bang Theory,169,31
20832,Raj,24," Good night, Sheldon.",4,Big Bang Theory,21,3
20833,Sheldon,24," Wait. Not yet. We still have to go over safety procedures. Now, the apartment has three emergency exits located here, here, and here. In the event of a power outage, luminous paint will guide you to the nearest exit.",4,Big Bang Theory,217,39
20834,Raj,24, You're kidding.,4,Big Bang Theory,16,2
20835,Sheldon,24, I never kid about safety.,4,Big Bang Theory,26,5
20837,Leonard,24, What are you doing here?,4,Big Bang Theory,25,5
20838,Raj,24, I was sleeping.,4,Big Bang Theory,16,3
20839,Leonard,24, In my bed?,4,Big Bang Theory,11,3
20840,Raj,24," Well, I would've slept in my own bed, but it was being used to bring shame to my family. And the memory of Gene Roddenberry.",4,Big Bang Theory,125,25
20841,Leonard,24," Oh, you heard?",4,Big Bang Theory,15,3
20842,Raj,24," Scotty, I need more power.",4,Big Bang Theory,27,5
20843,Leonard,24, Sorry. Does Sheldon know you're sleeping in here?,4,Big Bang Theory,50,8
20844,Raj,24," Are you kidding? He made me sign a waiver, participate in an emergency fire drill and take a refresher course in CPR. Thank God he had a dummy.",4,Big Bang Theory,144,28
20845,Leonard,24," Oh, yeah. Mouth-to-Mouth Mona. You know, she used to date Howard?",4,Big Bang Theory,66,11
20846,Raj,24," Oh, my God, she's that Mona? Why can't you and my sister spend your nights here?",4,Big Bang Theory,81,16
20847,Leonard,24, We tried. She doesn't get along with Sheldon.,4,Big Bang Theory,46,8
20848,Raj,24, Sheldon doesn't get along with Sheldon. It's still no reason for me to have to listen to you arm your photon torpedoes every night.,4,Big Bang Theory,132,24
20849,Leonard,24," Okay, well, how about this. Until Priya gets her own place, you stay here and I'll stay at your apartment.",4,Big Bang Theory,107,20
20850,Raj,24, Can I bring girls here?,4,Big Bang Theory,24,5
20851,Leonard,24, You? Sure. Bring as many as you want.,4,Big Bang Theory,38,8
20852,Raj,24," Okay, deal.",4,Big Bang Theory,12,2
20853,Leonard,24, Just not against their will.,4,Big Bang Theory,29,5
20855,Leonard,24, Do you really think you should be eating that cake?,4,Big Bang Theory,52,10
20856,Howard,24, Why?,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
20857,Leonard,24," If you're gonna be a trophy husband for a rich wife, you might want to watch your waistline.",4,Big Bang Theory,93,18
20858,Raj,24," He's right. A minute on the lips, a lifetime on the hips.",4,Big Bang Theory,58,12
20859,Howard,24," Yeah, ha-ha. First of all, I'm not threatened by my fiancÃ©e's success. I'm proud of her. And secondly, I have my own career.",4,Big Bang Theory,126,23
20860,Leonard,24, Until you have kids.,4,Big Bang Theory,21,4
20861,Sheldon,24," Good news, Raj. I got the blood work back from the lab. You're okay to stay for a while.",4,Big Bang Theory,89,19
20862,Raj,24, When did you take my blood?,4,Big Bang Theory,28,6
20863,Sheldon,24," Not important. Your sugar was a little high. I'd follow up with your regular physician. In the meantime, I have some paperwork here for you to go over.",4,Big Bang Theory,152,28
20864,Raj,24, What the hell is this?,4,Big Bang Theory,23,5
20865,Sheldon,24, Boilerplate stuff. A modified roommate agreement for a temporary house guest. And a living will and durable power of attorney.,4,Big Bang Theory,127,20
20866,Raj,24, This says you can make end of life decisions for me.,4,Big Bang Theory,53,11
20867,Sheldon,24," As your friend, let's hope it doesn't come to that. Please sign.",4,Big Bang Theory,65,12
20868,Raj,24, Did you sign this?,4,Big Bang Theory,19,4
20869,Leonard,24," There's a reciprocity clause. You get to pull the plug on him, too.",4,Big Bang Theory,68,13
20870,Raj,24," Well, that seems fair.",4,Big Bang Theory,23,4
20871,Sheldon,24," Congratulations and welcome temporarily aboard. Here's your I.D. Card, your key and your lapel pin. Which Leonard was too cool to wear. FYI, part of your responsibilities as roommate pro tem will be to drive me to and from work, the comic book store, the barbershop and the park for one hour every other Sunday for fresh air.",4,Big Bang Theory,326,58
20872,Leonard,24," Bring a ball or a Frisbee, you know, something he can chase.",4,Big Bang Theory,61,12
20873,Sheldon,24," Also, you're tasked with bringing home all takeout dinners. Tonight is Thai food. You'll find the standard order in appendix B or downloadable from my FTP server. If you have any questions, here's the FAQ sheet, or if you prefer the human touch, I do a live web chat called Apartment Talk on Tuesday nights.",4,Big Bang Theory,308,55
20874,Leonard,24, No backsies.,4,Big Bang Theory,13,2
20876,Raj,24," Sheldon, dinner!",4,Big Bang Theory,17,2
20877,Sheldon,24, What is this?,4,Big Bang Theory,14,3
20878,Raj,24, This is the difference between eating and dining.,4,Big Bang Theory,50,8
20879,Sheldon,24, Remarkable. I'm just realizing how much Leonard's been skating by all these years.,4,Big Bang Theory,83,13
20880,Raj,24, It's not a big thing. Just think of me as a brown Martha Stewart.,4,Big Bang Theory,66,14
20881,Penny,24," Hey, Sheldon, did you change your Wi-Fi password again?",4,Big Bang Theory,56,9
20882,Sheldon,24," Yes, it's â€œPenny, get your own Wi-Fi.â€ù No spaces.",4,Big Bang Theory,54,9
20883,Penny,24, Thanks. Wow! What's with the fancy spread?,4,Big Bang Theory,43,7
20884,Sheldon,24," My new roommate is bending over backwards to ingratiate himself to me.  Uh, nice touch, by the way.",4,Big Bang Theory,100,18
20885,Penny,24," What do you mean, new roommate? What happened to Leonard?",4,Big Bang Theory,58,10
20886,Sheldon,24, The same thing that happened to Homo Erectus. He was replaced by a superior species.,4,Big Bang Theory,85,15
20887,Raj,24, I'm the new Homo in town. That came out wrong.,4,Big Bang Theory,47,10
20888,Penny,24," All right, let me try this again. Where's Leonard?",4,Big Bang Theory,51,9
20889,Raj,24," He's living at my place, so I'm living here.",4,Big Bang Theory,45,9
20890,Sheldon,24, You're living here provisionally. But I must say it's looking good.,4,Big Bang Theory,68,11
20891,Penny,24," Woah, Leonard and Priya are living together? That's big.",4,Big Bang Theory,57,9
20892,Sheldon,24," No. Origami napkin swans, that's the headline.",4,Big Bang Theory,47,7
20893,Raj,24, It's a good thing.,4,Big Bang Theory,19,4
20895,Howard,24, So do you know what kind of research you'll be doing at this pharmaceutical company?,4,Big Bang Theory,85,15
20897,Howard,24," Oh, Bernie, no. You didn't have to.",4,Big Bang Theory,36,7
20899,Howard,24, You bought me a Rolex? How much did this cost?,4,Big Bang Theory,47,10
20902,Raj,24, More wine?,4,Big Bang Theory,11,2
20903,Penny,24," Oh, no, no, no. I've had way too much already.",4,Big Bang Theory,47,10
20904,Sheldon,24, Here's an interesting fact about alcohol.,4,Big Bang Theory,42,6
20905,Penny,24, Hit me.,4,Big Bang Theory,8,2
20906,Sheldon,24," Man is not the only species that ferments fruit in order to become intoxicated. Can you guess what the other is? Hint, sometimes they pack the alcohol in their trunks.",4,Big Bang Theory,168,30
20907,Penny,24, Monkeys.,4,Big Bang Theory,9,1
20908,Sheldon,24, When does a monkey have a trunk?,4,Big Bang Theory,33,7
20909,Penny,24, When a suitcase just won't do.,4,Big Bang Theory,31,6
20910,Sheldon,24," Mmm, all right. It would appear as if alcohol is playing keep-away with your intelligence. Good night. Please note, it is now past ten p.m. Per our roommate agreement, kindly refrain from raucous laughter, clinking of glasses, and celebratory gunfire.",4,Big Bang Theory,252,40
20911,Penny,24," Okay, explain something to me. You watch Leonard put up with that guy for years and years. What has to break inside your brain for you to think, Oh, Krishna, I've got to get me some of that?",4,Big Bang Theory,191,38
20912,Raj,24," Well, it's a lot better than having to wear noise-cancelling headphones in my own apartment.",4,Big Bang Theory,93,15
20913,Penny,24," What? Oh, God, yeah. Yeah. Leonard's a noisy little dude in the sack.",4,Big Bang Theory,70,13
20914,Raj,24, Every night.,4,Big Bang Theory,13,2
20915,Penny,24," Really? Even during allergy season, when he has to alternate between kissing and breathing?",4,Big Bang Theory,92,14
20916,Raj,24, It's my sister. Can we not talk about this any more?,4,Big Bang Theory,53,11
20917,Penny,24," Yeah. Sorry, sorry. Can I tell you a secret?",4,Big Bang Theory,45,9
20918,Raj,24, Yeah.,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
20919,Penny,24, I screwed up. Leonard's a great guy. Never should have broken up with him.,4,Big Bang Theory,75,14
20920,Raj,24," Well, uh, to paraphrase Shakespeare, It's better to have loved and lost than to stay home every night and download increasingly shameful pornography.",4,Big Bang Theory,150,23
20921,Penny,24," Oh, you poor baby.",4,Big Bang Theory,19,4
20922,Raj,24," What's wrong with me, Penny?",4,Big Bang Theory,29,5
20923,Penny,24," Nothing, nothing. You know, if we weren't friends, and you hadn't brought up that creepy pornography story, I'd be on you like the speed of light squared on matter to make energy.",4,Big Bang Theory,180,32
20924,Raj,24," Hey, you totally got that right! E equals M C squared.",4,Big Bang Theory,55,11
20925,Penny,24," I listen. I have no idea what it means, but I listen. To friendship.",4,Big Bang Theory,69,14
20926,Raj,24, To friendship.,4,Big Bang Theory,15,2
20927,Sheldon,24, Would you booze hounds please stop that infernal clinking? And the answer was elephant!,4,Big Bang Theory,88,14
20929,Leonard,24, Mmm. Mmm.,4,Big Bang Theory,10,2
20931,Leonard,24, Sorry.,4,Big Bang Theory,7,1
20933,Leonard,24," Oh, come on! Why don't we just tell them that we're dating?",4,Big Bang Theory,60,12
20935,Leonard,24, When is the time?,4,Big Bang Theory,18,4
20937,Leonard,24, Fine.,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
20945,Leonard,24, You're moving back to India?,4,Big Bang Theory,29,5
20948,Leonard,24, When were you going to tell me about this?,4,Big Bang Theory,43,9
20954,Leonard,24, She's lying because she doesn't want you to know we're dating.,4,Big Bang Theory,63,11
20956,Leonard,24," Well, what difference does it make? If you're moving back to India, we're obviously breaking up.",4,Big Bang Theory,97,16
20958,Leonard,24, So. Hot in India?,4,Big Bang Theory,18,4
20960,Leonard,24, Uh. That is a beautiful tapestry.,4,Big Bang Theory,34,6
20962,Penny,24," Oh, God. Oh, God! Oh. Okay, look. This never happened. Do you understand me?  Really? Still can't talk to me?",4,Big Bang Theory,110,20
20964,Sheldon,24, What are you doing here?,4,Big Bang Theory,25,5
20965,Leonard,24, What?,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
20966,Sheldon,24," I said, what are you doing here?",4,Big Bang Theory,33,7
20967,Leonard,24, I live here.,4,Big Bang Theory,13,3
20968,Sheldon,24, I have paperwork that says differently.,4,Big Bang Theory,40,6
20969,Leonard,24, Priya's going back to India.,4,Big Bang Theory,29,5
20970,Sheldon,24, Irrelevant. Rajesh and I have a good thing going and you're not going to ruin it.  What are you doing here?,4,Big Bang Theory,108,21
20971,Howard,24, I've been up all night. I had a fight with Bernadette.,4,Big Bang Theory,55,11
20972,Sheldon,24, Why?,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
20973,Howard,24, She gave me a beautiful watch.,4,Big Bang Theory,31,6
20974,Sheldon,24," Leonard, do you understand this?",4,Big Bang Theory,33,5
20975,Leonard,24, Yes.,4,Big Bang Theory,5,1
20976,Sheldon,24, Talk to him.,4,Big Bang Theory,13,3
20977,Penny,24, Damn.,4,Big Bang Theory,6,1
20978,Leonard,24, What's going on?,4,Big Bang Theory,17,3
20979,Penny,24," Oh. It's, it's not what it looks like.",4,Big Bang Theory,39,8
20980,Sheldon,24, What does it look like?,4,Big Bang Theory,24,5
20982,Sheldon,1, It's not what it looks like. It's not what it looks like.,5,Big Bang Theory,58,12
20983,Leonard,1, What are you grinding about?,5,Big Bang Theory,29,5
20984,Sheldon,1," Penny's brain teaser this morning. She and Koothrappali emerge from your bedroom. She is dishevelled, and Raj is dressed only in a sheet. The sole clue, it's not what it looks like.",5,Big Bang Theory,182,32
20985,Leonard,1," Just let it go, Sheldon.",5,Big Bang Theory,25,5
20986,Sheldon,1," If I could, I would, but I can't, so I shan't. Now, knowing Penny, the obvious answer is, they engaged in coitus. But, since that's what it looked like, we can rule that out. Let's put on our thinking cap, shall we?  Raj is from India, a tropical country. Third World hygiene. Parasitic infections are common, such as pinworms. Mm-hmm. The procedure for diagnosing pinworms is to wait until the subject is asleep, and the worms crawl out of the rectum for air.  Yes, just like that. Penny could have been inspecting Raj's anal region for parasites. Oh, boy. That's a true blue friend.",5,Big Bang Theory,585,104
20987,Leonard,1," They slept together, Sherlock.",5,Big Bang Theory,31,4
20988,Sheldon,1," No, you weren't listening. She said, it's not what it looks like.",5,Big Bang Theory,66,12
20989,Leonard,1, She lied.,5,Big Bang Theory,10,2
20990,Sheldon,1, Oh. Well don't I look silly sitting here wearing this?,5,Big Bang Theory,55,10
20992,Howard,1, Hey.,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
20993,Raj,1, Hey.,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
20994,Leonard,1, Hey.,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
20995,Sheldon,1," Hey. Leonard, is it awkward for you knowing that one of your dear friends had sexual intercourse with a woman you used to love in the very place you lay your head?",5,Big Bang Theory,164,32
20996,Leonard,1," No, I'm fine with it.",5,Big Bang Theory,22,5
20997,Sheldon,1," That sounds like sarcasm, but I'm going to disregard it, because I have an agenda. Paintball. Specifically, the interdepartmental tournament this weekend. Now, in order to function better as a fighting unit, I thought we should establish a chain of command. Now, it goes without saying that I would outrank the three of you, but the question remains, by how much? Now, I don't see me as some four-star general, back at HQ riding a desk and playing golf with the Secretary of Defence. But I also can't be Sergeant Cooper, because that might lead you to think of me as just a regular Joe. This might take some thought. As you were.",5,Big Bang Theory,630,113
20998,Leonard,1, What the hell is wrong with you?,5,Big Bang Theory,33,7
20999,Howard,1," Yeah, how could you do that?",5,Big Bang Theory,29,6
21000,Raj,1, What is it to you?,5,Big Bang Theory,19,5
21001,Howard,1, I got his back.,5,Big Bang Theory,16,4
21002,Raj,1," Yeah, right. You're just jealous because it turns out I'm Penny's number two choice after Leonard.",5,Big Bang Theory,99,16
21003,Howard,1," Hey, if I wasn't engaged to Bernadette, that totally could have been me.",5,Big Bang Theory,73,13
21004,Leonard,1," Please. Sheldon would have been before you, and he might not even have genitals.",5,Big Bang Theory,81,14
21005,Raj,1," Why do you care so much? You're dating my sister, and Penny and I are in love.",5,Big Bang Theory,79,17
21007,Sheldon,1," Gentlemen, if I may interject, I've decided my rank will be captain. If it's good enough for Kirk, Crunch and Kangaroo, it's good enough for me.",5,Big Bang Theory,145,26
21008,Howard,1, You're not in love with Penny.,5,Big Bang Theory,31,6
21009,Raj,1," Yes, I am. The god Kamadeva has shot us with his flowery arrows of love.",5,Big Bang Theory,73,15
21010,Howard,1, Who?,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
21011,Raj,1," He's the Hindu version of Cupid, but way better, because he rides a giant parrot.",5,Big Bang Theory,82,15
21012,Leonard,1," Raj, come on. You fall in love with any girl who smiles at you. A month ago, you were writing poems about his fiancee.",5,Big Bang Theory,119,24
21013,Howard,1, I'm sorry. What?,5,Big Bang Theory,17,3
21014,Raj,1, Rubbish. He's talking rubbish.,5,Big Bang Theory,31,4
21015,Leonard,1," Oh, Bernadette, please play my clarinet.",5,Big Bang Theory,41,6
21016,Raj,1," That could have been about anyone. Besides, you have nothing to worry about, because now I'm the dusky half of Koothrapenny.",5,Big Bang Theory,125,21
21017,Sheldon,1," For the record, I do have genitals. They're functional and aesthetically pleasing.",5,Big Bang Theory,83,12
21019,Penny,1," Coming. Yup, that's good. Wine glasses should have handles.",5,Big Bang Theory,60,9
21020,Amy,1, Keeping accurate track of your alcohol intake. Smart idea considering how trampy you get when you've had a few.,5,Big Bang Theory,112,19
21021,Penny,1, You heard what I did?,5,Big Bang Theory,22,5
21022,Amy,1," Well, I heard who you did.",5,Big Bang Theory,27,6
21023,Penny,1," Oh, my God, I screwed up everything. I hurt Leonard, I hurt Raj, I mean, what is wrong with me? I feel like two totally different people, Dr. Jekyll and Mrs. Whore.",5,Big Bang Theory,165,32
21024,Amy,1, Don't be so hard on yourself. Do you know the story of Catherine the Great?,5,Big Bang Theory,76,15
21025,Penny,1, No.,5,Big Bang Theory,4,1
21026,Amy,1," She ruled Russia in the late seventeen hundreds, and one night, when she was feeling particularly randy, she used an intricate system of pulleys to have intimate relations with a horse.",5,Big Bang Theory,186,31
21027,Penny,1, I'm I'm sorry. What does this have to do with me?,5,Big Bang Theory,50,11
21028,Amy,1," She engaged in interspecies hanky-panky, and people still call her great. I'm sure your reputation can survive you shagging a little Indian boy.",5,Big Bang Theory,145,23
21031,Raj,1," Please, come in.",5,Big Bang Theory,17,3
21033,Raj,1," Well, you were always so nice to me, I thought maybe you liked me.",5,Big Bang Theory,67,14
21035,Raj,1, I'm sorry.,5,Big Bang Theory,11,2
21037,Raj,1," I will. Hey, Bernadette?",5,Big Bang Theory,25,4
21039,Raj,1, Do you think I have a shot with Penny?,5,Big Bang Theory,39,9
21042,Penny,1," You know, I've done this before. In kindergarten, I was supposed to marry Jason Sorensen at recess, but by the time my class got out there, he was already engaged to Chelsea Himmelfarb. So what did I do? Hung upside down from the monkey bars, let all the boys see my underpants.",5,Big Bang Theory,279,52
21043,Amy,1," You can't blame yourself. When your prefrontal cortex fails to make you happy, promiscuity rewards you with the needed flood of dopamine. We neurobiologists refer to this as the skank reflex.",5,Big Bang Theory,192,31
21044,Penny,1, You know what? Let's get out of here.,5,Big Bang Theory,38,8
21045,Amy,1, Where are we going?,5,Big Bang Theory,20,4
21046,Penny,1, Somewhere where no one's seen me naked. We may have to drive awhile. ,5,Big Bang Theory,70,13
21047,Sheldon,1," Subtlety isn't her strong suit, is it?",5,Big Bang Theory,39,7
21048,Penny,1, Can I stay at your place for a few nights?,5,Big Bang Theory,43,10
21049,Amy,1, Really? A best friend sleepover? Yay.,5,Big Bang Theory,38,6
21050,Penny,1," Yeah, sure. Yay!",5,Big Bang Theory,17,3
21051,Amy,1," We'll make popcorn, stay up all night and I'll teach you my secret language, Op.",5,Big Bang Theory,81,15
21052,Penny,1, Sounds great.,5,Big Bang Theory,14,2
21053,Amy,1, Nope. Sounds Gop Rop E A Top.,5,Big Bang Theory,30,7
21054,Penny,1," Yeah, I'm gonna go pack a bag.",5,Big Bang Theory,31,7
21055,Amy,1," No, you're not. You're gonna Pop A Cop Kop A Bop A Gop.",5,Big Bang Theory,56,13
21057,Leonard,1, Do we really have to wear this camouflage crap to play paintball?,5,Big Bang Theory,66,12
21058,Sheldon,1," Who said that? Leonard, I can hear your voice, but I can't see you.",5,Big Bang Theory,68,14
21059,Leonard,1," I'm not in the mood, Sheldon.",5,Big Bang Theory,30,6
21060,Sheldon,1," Oh, there you are. Leonard, I know you're upset about recent events, and I have someone here to help. ",5,Big Bang Theory,103,19
21061,Leonard,1, I don't want to talk to Amy.,5,Big Bang Theory,29,7
21062,Sheldon,1," No, it's not Amy.",5,Big Bang Theory,18,4
21064,Leonard,1, You called my mother?,5,Big Bang Theory,22,4
21065,Sheldon,1," Oh, Leonard, is it really necessary to caption the obvious?",5,Big Bang Theory,60,10
21067,Leonard,1, What's going on? What do you want?,5,Big Bang Theory,35,7
21069,Leonard,1, That's so nice.,5,Big Bang Theory,16,3
21071,Leonard,1," Well, uh, okay, um, I don't want to get back together with Penny. We tried it, it was crazy, it didn't work, but I can't deal with the fact that she slept with my friend Raj. And then I find out that Raj's sister Priya, who I've been going out with for eight months, is moving back to India. So I'm just completely confused and alone.",5,Big Bang Theory,335,66
21073,Leonard,1, Got any advice?,5,Big Bang Theory,16,3
21075,Leonard,1," Excuse me. You're a world-renowned expert in parenting and child development, and all you've got is buck up?",5,Big Bang Theory,109,18
21077,Leonard,1," Thanks, Mother. I feel much better.",5,Big Bang Theory,36,6
21080,Amy,1," Ninety-nine, one hundred. It's like a waterfall of liquid gold. My turn.",5,Big Bang Theory,73,12
21081,Penny,1," You know, I don't even know what the point of me staying in L.A. is. I haven't gotten a single acting job since I moved out here. The closest I came was last month, I got a callback for a hemorrhoid commercial.",5,Big Bang Theory,211,42
21082,Amy,1," Oh, I could so see you being the face of haemorrhoids.",5,Big Bang Theory,55,11
21083,Penny,1," I know, right? Maybe I should just move back to Nebraska.",5,Big Bang Theory,58,11
21084,Amy,1," No, I can't let you do that.",5,Big Bang Theory,29,7
21085,Penny,1, Why not? ,5,Big Bang Theory,10,2
21086,Amy,1," For the first time ever, I have a thriving social life. And no pressure, but it kind of lives and dies with you.",5,Big Bang Theory,113,23
21087,Raj,1," Hi, Amy. Can I talk to Penny?",5,Big Bang Theory,30,7
21088,Amy,1, A guest in my trundle bed and a boy at my door? I wish I could tell 13-year-old me it does get better.,5,Big Bang Theory,103,23
21089,Penny,1, How did you know I was here?,5,Big Bang Theory,29,7
21090,Raj,1, It's all over her Facebook page.,5,Big Bang Theory,33,6
21091,Amy,1, I'll take your stuff to the bedroom and clear out a drawer.,5,Big Bang Theory,60,12
21092,Penny,1, Thanks.,5,Big Bang Theory,8,1
21093,Amy,1," No problem. Try and keep it in your pants, okay?",5,Big Bang Theory,49,10
21094,Penny,1," So, hi. What's up?",5,Big Bang Theory,19,4
21095,Raj,1," I was wondering if you're free Friday. They're having a Totally '80s Night at the Greek. Hall & Oates, Katrina and the Waves and three-fifths of Kajagoogoo.",5,Big Bang Theory,157,27
21096,Penny,1," Oh. Gee, that's really sweet, but the thing is",5,Big Bang Theory,47,9
21097,Raj,1," Aw, there's a thing.",5,Big Bang Theory,21,4
21098,Penny,1," Look, honey, I was really drunk and made a huge mistake last night. We should've never slept together. It's what ruins friendships.",5,Big Bang Theory,132,22
21099,Raj,1, You can't ruin a friendship with sex. That's like trying to ruin ice cream with chocolate sprinkles.,5,Big Bang Theory,101,17
21100,Penny,1," Come here. Just listen to me. I want to go back to the way we were before. You know, friends. No sprinkles.",5,Big Bang Theory,108,22
21101,Raj,1, Oh. All right.,5,Big Bang Theory,15,3
21102,Penny,1, Thank you.,5,Big Bang Theory,11,2
21103,Raj,1," Well, uh, as your friend, you might like to know that, um, we didn't have sex in the conventional sense.",5,Big Bang Theory,105,20
21104,Penny,1," Oh, God. Did you pull some weird Indian crap on me?",5,Big Bang Theory,52,11
21105,Raj,1," No, no. After we got undressed and jumped in bed, you, you asked if I had protection.",5,Big Bang Theory,86,17
21106,Penny,1," Oh, you did, didn't you?",5,Big Bang Theory,25,5
21107,Raj,1," Of course. I'm always packing. Anyway, um, I had trouble putting it on and you tried to help and, that was all she wrote.",5,Big Bang Theory,122,24
21108,Penny,1," So, we didn't actually",5,Big Bang Theory,23,4
21109,Raj,1, I did. It was beautiful.,5,Big Bang Theory,25,5
21110,Penny,1, Oh!,5,Big Bang Theory,4,1
21111,Raj,1," Penny, please, please promise me you won't tell anybody about this.",5,Big Bang Theory,68,11
21112,Penny,1," Of course I won't. No, I won't.",5,Big Bang Theory,32,7
21113,Raj,1," Oh, good. Um, can I tell people that our love burned too bright and too quickly? Kind of a Candle in the Wind deal?",5,Big Bang Theory,116,24
21114,Penny,1, Sure.,5,Big Bang Theory,6,1
21115,Raj,1," Cool. Can I say it fell apart because you were all, I want to have your babies, and I was like, I'm too rock and roll to be tied down?",5,Big Bang Theory,135,30
21116,Penny,1, No.,5,Big Bang Theory,4,1
21117,Raj,1, Can I say I ruined you for white men?,5,Big Bang Theory,38,9
21118,Penny,1, Also no.,5,Big Bang Theory,9,2
21119,Raj,1," Okay, just the candle thing.",5,Big Bang Theory,29,5
21120,Penny,1, Yeah.,5,Big Bang Theory,6,1
21121,Raj,1, Cool. All right friend.,5,Big Bang Theory,24,4
21122,Penny,1, Hmm.,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
21123,Raj,1, I'll see you around.,5,Big Bang Theory,21,4
21124,Penny,1," Okay. Raj, wait. Thank you for being my friend. ",5,Big Bang Theory,49,9
21125,Raj,1, Penny?,5,Big Bang Theory,7,1
21126,Penny,1, Mm-hmm?,5,Big Bang Theory,8,1
21127,Raj,1, It's getting beautiful again.,5,Big Bang Theory,30,4
21129,Sheldon,1," All right, this is a Google Earth view of the field of battle.",5,Big Bang Theory,63,13
21130,Howard,1, I don't see anything.,5,Big Bang Theory,22,4
21131,Sheldon,1," Give it a second to load. Whenever you're ready, AT&T! Okay, here we go. This is us here. To the south is Professor Loomis and the Geology Department. According to their Twitter feed, they're out of sunblock, which means they'll have to hug the tree line or risk melanoma. That's our edge. All we have to do is move quickly over this ridge, the rock-worshipping pasty-faced bastards won't know what hit them. All right, let's move out.",5,Big Bang Theory,436,77
21132,Leonard,1," Hang on, Sheldon. How could you not tell me your sister was moving back to India?",5,Big Bang Theory,82,16
21133,Howard,1, Maybe he was too busy writing clumsy penis metaphors about my fiancee.,5,Big Bang Theory,71,12
21134,Raj,1, Screw you. That was a beautifully written penis metaphor.,5,Big Bang Theory,58,9
21135,Leonard,1," You know what, guys, I'm not in the mood for paintball. What do you say we just bag it?",5,Big Bang Theory,88,19
21136,Howard,1, Fine with me.,5,Big Bang Theory,14,3
21137,Raj,1," Sure, whatever.",5,Big Bang Theory,16,2
21138,Sheldon,1, You can't quit. That's a court-martial offence. That's punishable by You can't quit.,5,Big Bang Theory,85,13
21139,Leonard,1," Sorry, Sheldon, it's just not a good time for playing games.",5,Big Bang Theory,61,11
21140,Sheldon,1," This is a game to you? Uh, was the Battle of Antietam a game? Huh? Was the sack of Rome a game?",5,Big Bang Theory,96,22
21141,Leonard,1," Yes, no and no.",5,Big Bang Theory,16,4
21142,Sheldon,1," Wait. I just want you all to know that I forgive you. This mutiny isn't your fault, it's mine. I haven't earned these bars. Although what I lack in leadership, apparently I more than make up for in sewing.",5,Big Bang Theory,206,39
21143,Howard,1," Let it go, Sheldon. I'll get you a Jamba Juice on the way home.",5,Big Bang Theory,64,14
21144,Sheldon,1, No. Jamba Juice is for heroes. And that's what we're going to be.,5,Big Bang Theory,66,13
21145,Leonard,1, What are you doing?,5,Big Bang Theory,20,4
21146,Sheldon,1," Following in the footsteps of Kirk, Crunch and Kangaroo.  Geology isn't a real science! ",5,Big Bang Theory,89,14
21147,Howard,1, Damn those sons of bitches!,5,Big Bang Theory,28,5
21148,Leonard,1, Let's get 'em!,5,Big Bang Theory,15,3
21149,Sheldon,1," If there's ever a Church of Sheldon, this will be when it started. Ow!",5,Big Bang Theory,71,14
21151,Leonard,1," I'd like to propose a toast to the man whose noble sacrifice inspired our victory, Captain Sheldon Cooper.",5,Big Bang Theory,107,18
21153,Sheldon,1," Excuse me. It's Major Sheldon Cooper. With my last breath, I awarded myself a battlefield promotion. It's kind of a big deal.",5,Big Bang Theory,126,22
21154,Penny,1, Hi. You guys have a minute?,5,Big Bang Theory,28,6
21155,Leonard,1," Uh, yeah, sure.",5,Big Bang Theory,16,3
21156,Penny,1," Okay. Um. Well, I already talked to Raj, but I wanted to apologize to the rest of you for, you know, everything.",5,Big Bang Theory,113,22
21157,Raj,1," Please, Penny, let me. We've decided to let our crazy, wonderful night together be just one of those memories you have and can call to mind when you're feeling blue or you're in the shower.",5,Big Bang Theory,190,35
21158,Penny,1," Hey, what you doing, Quick Draw?",5,Big Bang Theory,33,6
21159,Raj,1, Sorry. Go on.,5,Big Bang Theory,14,3
21160,Penny,1," Anyways, I wanted you guys all to know that I've been taking a really hard look at things and come to the conclusion I have to stop kidding myself. I suck at acting. It's time for me to move back to Nebraska.",5,Big Bang Theory,209,42
21161,Leonard,1, You're leaving?,5,Big Bang Theory,16,2
21162,Penny,1, Yeah.,5,Big Bang Theory,6,1
21163,Howard,1, What are you going to do in Nebraska?,5,Big Bang Theory,38,8
21164,Penny,1," I don't know, maybe teach acting.  Oh, sorry. Hold on. Hello?",5,Big Bang Theory,62,11
21165,Leonard,1," Penny, Penny, listen, I hope you're not doing this 'cause of you and me, because I have a girlfriend, and you're a single woman.",5,Big Bang Theory,129,24
21166,Penny,1," Shh! It's my agent, it's my agent. You're kidding. Oh, my gosh. I can't believe it! Really? Oh, I'm so excited, thank you, thank you so much. Okay, bye. I got the haemorrhoid commercial! I start Monday.",5,Big Bang Theory,203,37
21167,Sheldon,1, What about Nebraska?,5,Big Bang Theory,21,3
21168,Penny,1," Oh, hell with Nebraska. I'm gonna be a star!",5,Big Bang Theory,45,9
21169,Sheldon,1, Have you ever thought of teaching physics?,5,Big Bang Theory,43,7
21172,Penny,1," I don't think so, Mom. Not today.",5,Big Bang Theory,34,7
21174,Penny,1, You don't know the half of it.,5,Big Bang Theory,31,7
21176,Penny,1, Rose-scented Preparation-H for women?,5,Big Bang Theory,38,4
21178,Leonard,1, I'm proud of you.,5,Big Bang Theory,18,4
21179,Penny,1, Shh! Here comes my joke.,5,Big Bang Theory,25,5
21181,Penny,1, Sittin' pretty.,5,Big Bang Theory,16,2
21184,Sheldon,2, What are you doing?,5,Big Bang Theory,20,4
21185,Leonard,2," Oh, uh, Priya's calling in a few minutes on Skype, and we are gonna have a dinner date.",5,Big Bang Theory,88,18
21186,Sheldon,2, It's eight o'clock in the morning in Mumbai. How can she have dinner?,5,Big Bang Theory,70,13
21187,Leonard,2," Fine, whatever. Priya will be having breakfast.",5,Big Bang Theory,48,7
21188,Sheldon,2," All right, so technically it's not a dinner date. I suppose you could call it a, uh, dinfast date. But if you did, you'd open yourself to peer-based mocking, such as, Hey, Leonard, how was your dinfast with Priya last night?",5,Big Bang Theory,225,41
21189,Leonard,2, That doesn't sound like mocking.,5,Big Bang Theory,33,5
21190,Sheldon,2, You didn't let me finish. Dinfast . Are those soy-based candles?,5,Big Bang Theory,65,11
21191,Leonard,2, I don't know. Why?,5,Big Bang Theory,19,4
21192,Sheldon,2, Paraffin candles may contain carcinogens. Unless lung cancer is the ambiance you were going for at your dinfast. Dinfast .,5,Big Bang Theory,123,20
21193,Leonard,2," Listen, I don't want to be rude, but Priya's gonna be calling any minute, so",5,Big Bang Theory,77,15
21194,Sheldon,2," Oh, yes, Priya. Leonard, you know I make a point of never interfering in your personal affairs.",5,Big Bang Theory,96,17
21195,Leonard,2," Yes, I've always admired that about you.",5,Big Bang Theory,41,7
21196,Sheldon,2, As well you should. But I'm going to make an exception here.,5,Big Bang Theory,61,12
21197,Leonard,2," Oh, good.",5,Big Bang Theory,10,2
21198,Sheldon,2," Priya has moved back to India to pursue her law career. Instead of desperately trying to keep this intercontinental relationship alive, you could use that time to take up a hobby.",5,Big Bang Theory,180,31
21199,Leonard,2, A hobby?,5,Big Bang Theory,9,2
21200,Sheldon,2, Yes. I read recently about a fellow in Kansas with an enormous ball of twine. I bet you could give him a run for his money.,5,Big Bang Theory,124,26
21201,Leonard,2," You know, some people might say that it's great that we're trying to make things work long distance. They'd say things like, love is stronger than the miles between you.",5,Big Bang Theory,170,30
21202,Sheldon,2," When I rise to power, those people will be sterilized.",5,Big Bang Theory,55,10
21203,Leonard,2, You video-chat with Amy all the time. How is this different?,5,Big Bang Theory,61,11
21204,Sheldon,2, Don't you like Amy?,5,Big Bang Theory,20,4
21205,Leonard,2, Of course I like Amy.,5,Big Bang Theory,22,5
21206,Sheldon,2," Well, there's the difference. ",5,Big Bang Theory,31,4
21207,Leonard,2," Excuse me, that's Priya.",5,Big Bang Theory,25,4
21209,Leonard,2," Hey, honey.",5,Big Bang Theory,12,2
21211,Leonard,2," Oh, I miss you, too.",5,Big Bang Theory,21,5
21212,Sheldon,2, I miss the old days when your romantic partners could be returned to the video store.,5,Big Bang Theory,86,16
21214,Sheldon,2, Thanks for letting me stay here while Leonard Skypes with his girlfriend.,5,Big Bang Theory,74,12
21215,Penny,2," Oh, it's no problem. It's actually kind of nice. You reading, me reading. We're like an old married couple.",5,Big Bang Theory,108,19
21216,Sheldon,2," If we were an old married couple, the wife would serve iced tea and snickerdoodles.",5,Big Bang Theory,84,15
21217,Penny,2, I don't have iced tea and snickerdoodles.,5,Big Bang Theory,42,7
21218,Sheldon,2, A good wife would go to the store.,5,Big Bang Theory,35,8
21219,Penny,2, I want a divorce.,5,Big Bang Theory,18,4
21220,Sheldon,2," Good. On the way to see the lawyer, pick up some tea and cookies. I must say, I am enjoying your new chair.",5,Big Bang Theory,108,23
21221,Penny,2," It's great, isn't it?",5,Big Bang Theory,22,4
21222,Sheldon,2," It is. Aligns the lumbar, cradles the coccyx, balances the buttocks. This is a chair worthy of the name.",5,Big Bang Theory,105,19
21223,Penny,2, What name?,5,Big Bang Theory,11,2
21224,Sheldon,2, Chair.,5,Big Bang Theory,7,1
21225,Penny,2," Oh, all right, well, I'm glad you like it. I mean, I still can't get over the fact someone just threw it away.",5,Big Bang Theory,111,23
21226,Sheldon,2, What?,5,Big Bang Theory,6,1
21227,Penny,2," Yeah, it was just sitting on the street. I paid a homeless guy ten bucks to help me get it up here.",5,Big Bang Theory,100,22
21228,Sheldon,2," Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. ",5,Big Bang Theory,31,6
21229,Penny,2, What is wrong?,5,Big Bang Theory,15,3
21230,Sheldon,2, I've been sitting in garbage!,5,Big Bang Theory,30,5
21231,Penny,2," Sheldon, take it easy.",5,Big Bang Theory,23,4
21232,Sheldon,2, You take it easy! I need to use your shower.,5,Big Bang Theory,45,10
21233,Penny,2, I went into this marriage with so much hope.,5,Big Bang Theory,45,9
21234,Sheldon,2, There's a wet Band-Aid on the shower floor. .,5,Big Bang Theory,46,9
21236,Raj,2, This is fun. I've never used a hydraulic thermoforming press before.,5,Big Bang Theory,69,11
21237,Howard,2," Pretty sweet, huh? This little baby set the university back 175 grand.",5,Big Bang Theory,71,12
21238,Leonard,2, That's three minutes. Should we see what we got?,5,Big Bang Theory,49,9
21239,Howard,2, Hang on.,5,Big Bang Theory,9,2
21240,Raj,2," Oh, yeah. This is one good-looking panini.",5,Big Bang Theory,43,7
21241,Howard,2, Hand me the tuna melt.,5,Big Bang Theory,23,5
21242,Leonard,2, Yep.,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
21243,Howard,2, Thank you. How's it going with the long-distance love affair?,5,Big Bang Theory,62,10
21244,Leonard,2," Not easy, but we're making it work.",5,Big Bang Theory,36,7
21245,Howard,2," When you say making it work, does that include doing the cyber nasty?",5,Big Bang Theory,70,13
21246,Leonard,2, What?,5,Big Bang Theory,6,1
21247,Howard,2," You know, the virtual pickle tickle. The digital bow-chicka-bow-bow.",5,Big Bang Theory,69,9
21248,Raj,2," Come on, dude. This is my sister you're talking about.",5,Big Bang Theory,55,10
21249,Howard,2," Hey, Leonard jiggling his junk at her through a webcam has got to be easier for you to deal with than him actually touching her with it.",5,Big Bang Theory,137,27
21250,Leonard,2, There's no junk jiggling. We just talk.,5,Big Bang Theory,40,7
21251,Howard,2," Are you insane? With high-speed Internet, you have at your fingertips the greatest advancement in the field of sex since the invention of the washcloth.",5,Big Bang Theory,153,25
21252,Leonard,2, I can't do that.,5,Big Bang Theory,17,4
21253,Howard,2," Well, if you don't, you're gonna lose Priya to some fancy guy in a turban who grew up with Kama Sutra coloring books.",5,Big Bang Theory,118,23
21254,Raj,2, How can you be so racist?,5,Big Bang Theory,26,6
21255,Howard,2," Oh, come on, tell me I'm wrong.",5,Big Bang Theory,32,7
21256,Sheldon,2," Oh, Leonard, good. There you are. I need you to check my head for chair lice.",5,Big Bang Theory,78,16
21257,Leonard,2," I did it last night, I'm not doing it again.",5,Big Bang Theory,45,10
21258,Howard,2," Just his head, right?",5,Big Bang Theory,22,4
21259,Leonard,2, I don't want to talk about it. You didn't catch bugs from Penny's chair.,5,Big Bang Theory,73,14
21260,Sheldon,2," Yes, I did. And now they're cavorting at the base of my hair follicles like dancing hippies at the Redwood National Forest.",5,Big Bang Theory,124,22
21261,Leonard,2," Sheldon, you do this all the time. You fixate on some crazy idea and then blow it way out of proportion.",5,Big Bang Theory,105,21
21262,Sheldon,2, Name one time I've ever done that.,5,Big Bang Theory,35,7
21263,Leonard,2, How about when you put GPS trackers in your garbage because you were convinced North Korean spies were stealing your doodles? The chicken nuggets you were sure were human nuggets. The strangely-shaped cloud that was following you around town. The time you put on my shirt by mistake and were convinced you'd started growing again.,5,Big Bang Theory,331,55
21264,Sheldon,2," I said, name one. You really need to work on your listening skills.",5,Big Bang Theory,68,13
21266,Sheldon,2,  Penny.  Penny.  Penny.,5,Big Bang Theory,24,3
21267,Penny,2, Yello.,5,Big Bang Theory,7,1
21268,Sheldon,2, You need to remove that chair from the building. It's a health hazard.,5,Big Bang Theory,71,13
21269,Penny,2," Okay, relax. I took off the slipcovers, had them dry-cleaned and then fumigated the cushions.",5,Big Bang Theory,94,15
21270,Sheldon,2, Really?,5,Big Bang Theory,8,1
21271,Penny,2, Yeah. It's cleaner than my couch. Found half a Hot Pocket in there.,5,Big Bang Theory,68,13
21272,Sheldon,2, It certainly looks okay. Has a strong toxic chemical smell. That's reassuring.,5,Big Bang Theory,79,12
21273,Penny,2," Why don't you give it a try, Sheldon?",5,Big Bang Theory,38,8
21274,Sheldon,2, All right. It is a comfortable chair.,5,Big Bang Theory,38,7
21275,Penny,2, Why don't you just admit you overreacted?,5,Big Bang Theory,42,7
21276,Sheldon,2," No, thank you. (Sees insect. More appear and swarm all over him. He jumps out of a daydream on his own couch. Jumps up and runs out to Penny's apartment.",5,Big Bang Theory,154,30
21277,Leonard,2, It's like living with a Chihuahua.,5,Big Bang Theory,35,6
21278,Sheldon,2,  Penny.  Penny.  Penny.,5,Big Bang Theory,24,3
21279,Penny,2," What's up, buttercup?",5,Big Bang Theory,22,3
21280,Sheldon,2, You have to get rid of the chair.,5,Big Bang Theory,34,8
21281,Penny,2, Nope.  ,5,Big Bang Theory,8,1
21282,Sheldon,2,  Penny.  Penny.  Penny.,5,Big Bang Theory,24,3
21283,Penny,2," What's the word, hummingbird?",5,Big Bang Theory,30,4
21284,Sheldon,2," For your safety, please wait in my apartment as I call the authorities so they may remove the chair of death.",5,Big Bang Theory,110,21
21285,Penny,2, No. ,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
21286,Sheldon,2,  Penny.  Penny.  Penny.,5,Big Bang Theory,24,3
21287,Penny,2," What's the gist, physicist?",5,Big Bang Theory,28,4
21288,Sheldon,2," Under my authority as a self-appointed member of the Centres for Disease Control street team, these premises are condemned.  As a man with a keen sense of style, I must tell you, that chair does not work with the room. .  Penny.  Penny.   Penny.",5,Big Bang Theory,246,44
21290,Leonard,2," So, here we are. Back in bed together.",5,Big Bang Theory,39,8
21292,Leonard,2," Okay, so I, I, I guess I'll just jump right in.",5,Big Bang Theory,48,11
21294,Leonard,2," Uh, you're a naughty girl. And, and, uh, I, I want to punish you with my love?",5,Big Bang Theory,79,17
21296,Leonard,2, Not good?,5,Big Bang Theory,10,2
21298,Leonard,2," Okay. Uh, uh, you're not naughty. Uh, you're, you're, you're dirty. You're, you're a, a dirty girl?",5,Big Bang Theory,100,17
21300,Leonard,2," Yeah, yeah. Uh, okay. You're a, you're a, you're a, a dirty, disgusting, revolting girl. Ugh!",5,Big Bang Theory,94,16
21302,Leonard,2, Why don't you just give me five minutes? I'll Google how to do this. I'll call you right back.,5,Big Bang Theory,95,19
21304,Leonard,2," Okay, like usual. Good.",5,Big Bang Theory,24,4
21306,Leonard,2, All rightie. Shirt coming off. Ta-da! Man nipples.,5,Big Bang Theory,51,8
21308,Leonard,2," Yes, ma'am.",5,Big Bang Theory,12,2
21310,Leonard,2," Taking shorts off. There we go. Naked, naked, naked!",5,Big Bang Theory,53,9
21312,Leonard,2, Cool.  Uh-oh!,5,Big Bang Theory,14,2
21314,Leonard,2," Oh, damn it!",5,Big Bang Theory,13,3
21316,Leonard,2," No, no! No-no-no! The screen froze. It's probably just buffering, just give it a second.",5,Big Bang Theory,89,15
21318,Leonard,2," So, how are your mom and dad?",5,Big Bang Theory,30,7
21320,Leonard,2," Yeah. Sure, sure.",5,Big Bang Theory,18,3
21321,Sheldon,2," If your video's frozen, try resetting the TCP/IP stack.",5,Big Bang Theory,56,9
21322,Leonard,2, Oh! I didn't even think of that. Thanks.,5,Big Bang Theory,41,8
21323,Sheldon,2, You're welcome. Please let me know when you and your girlfriend are done hogging the bandwidth for your self-abuse. I'm trying to stream a movie on Netflix in here.,5,Big Bang Theory,165,29
21325,Amy,2," Five, six, seven, eight. Tall and tan and young and lovely, the girl from Ipanema goes walking, and when she passes, each one she passes goes",5,Big Bang Theory,142,26
21326,Sheldon,2,  Amy.  Amy.  Amy.,5,Big Bang Theory,18,3
21327,Amy,2, Oh You are aware that your ritualistic knocking behaviour is symptomatic of obsessive compulsive disorder?,5,Big Bang Theory,107,15
21328,Sheldon,2," Is not. Is not, is not.",5,Big Bang Theory,24,6
21329,Amy,2," Denial. Denial, denial. Come in.",5,Big Bang Theory,33,5
21330,Sheldon,2, Thank you.,5,Big Bang Theory,11,2
21331,Amy,2, Would you like to hear me play a bossa nova standard on the harp?,5,Big Bang Theory,66,14
21332,Sheldon,2, No.,5,Big Bang Theory,4,1
21333,Amy,2, How about the theme song to the classic television show Diff'rent Strokes? Now the world don't move to the beat,5,Big Bang Theory,112,20
21334,Sheldon,2, No.,5,Big Bang Theory,4,1
21335,Amy,2," Well, that's every song I know. What's up?",5,Big Bang Theory,43,8
21336,Sheldon,2," You're good friends with Penny, right?",5,Big Bang Theory,39,6
21337,Amy,2," Best friends, besties, BFFs, peas in a pod, sisters who would share travelling pants. Go on.",5,Big Bang Theory,93,16
21338,Sheldon,2, I was hoping she might listen to you about the dangers of owning unhygienic furniture.,5,Big Bang Theory,87,15
21339,Amy,2," For general educational purposes, or has she acquired a bar stool dipped in cholera?",5,Big Bang Theory,85,14
21340,Sheldon,2, Cholera is water-borne. You're mocking me.,5,Big Bang Theory,43,6
21341,Amy,2," Yes, I am.",5,Big Bang Theory,11,3
21342,Sheldon,2, Penny has dragged a chair in off the street whose unknown provenance jeopardizes the health and welfare of every resident in our building.,5,Big Bang Theory,139,23
21343,Amy,2," Sheldon, just because you have a focus on cleanliness bordering on the psychotic doesn't mean I have to participate.",5,Big Bang Theory,117,19
21344,Sheldon,2," All right, name your price.",5,Big Bang Theory,28,5
21345,Amy,2, Kiss me where I've never been kissed before.,5,Big Bang Theory,45,8
21346,Sheldon,2, You mean like Salt Lake City?,5,Big Bang Theory,30,6
21347,Amy,2, Never mind. I'll talk to Penny.,5,Big Bang Theory,32,6
21348,Sheldon,2, Thank you.,5,Big Bang Theory,11,2
21349,Amy,2, Will you listen to me play my harp now?,5,Big Bang Theory,40,9
21350,Sheldon,2," No. I dislike the sound of the harp. Its overuse in classic television sitcoms always makes me think I'm going to experience an episode from my past.  I'm sorry, Mommy. Don't be mad at me. Don't do that!",5,Big Bang Theory,204,38
21352,Leonard,2," I don't know about this, Howard.",5,Big Bang Theory,33,6
21353,Howard,2," What? You're having trouble with the long-distance lovemaking. This is your answer. There are two interfaces that simulate a human mouth. You have one, Priya has one in India. When you move your lips and tongue on yours, it transmits exactly what you're doing to hers. See? Internet kissing.  Give it a try.",5,Big Bang Theory,308,53
21354,Leonard,2, I don't think so.,5,Big Bang Theory,18,4
21355,Raj,2, I'll try it. Like this?,5,Big Bang Theory,24,5
21356,Howard,2," Almost. Really get your tongue in there, to activate the motion sensor.",5,Big Bang Theory,72,12
21357,Raj,2, Like this?,5,Big Bang Theory,11,2
21358,Howard,2, Close. Really French it.,5,Big Bang Theory,25,4
21359,Raj,2, Better?,5,Big Bang Theory,8,1
21360,Howard,2," Yeah, you got it, you got it.",5,Big Bang Theory,30,7
21361,Raj,2, I'm impressed. This is very lifelike.,5,Big Bang Theory,38,6
21362,Howard,2, Whoa! You just bit my tongue!,5,Big Bang Theory,30,6
21363,Raj,2," I, I nibbled. I was being playful.",5,Big Bang Theory,35,7
21364,Howard,2, Why do you have to make everything weird?,5,Big Bang Theory,42,8
21365,Raj,2, Sorry. Better?,5,Big Bang Theory,15,2
21366,Howard,2," Oh, yeah.",5,Big Bang Theory,10,2
21368,Penny,2," Pretty cool, huh? Probably would cost, like, two hundred bucks in a store.",5,Big Bang Theory,75,13
21369,Amy,2, I do appreciate a bargain. This entire ensemble once belonged to my dead grandmother.,5,Big Bang Theory,86,14
21370,Penny,2, You're kidding.,5,Big Bang Theory,16,2
21371,Amy,2, Everything except bra and panties. And they're a leopard-spotted secret I share with Victoria.,5,Big Bang Theory,95,14
21372,Penny,2, And now me.,5,Big Bang Theory,12,3
21373,Amy,2, I just have one question about the chair.,5,Big Bang Theory,42,8
21374,Penny,2, And what's that?,5,Big Bang Theory,17,3
21375,Amy,2, Aren't you worried about it being unhygienic?,5,Big Bang Theory,46,7
21376,Penny,2," No, it's completely fine. Hmm. I get it. Sheldon sent you. He put you up to this.",5,Big Bang Theory,82,17
21377,Amy,2," No, he didn't.",5,Big Bang Theory,15,3
21378,Penny,2, Really?,5,Big Bang Theory,8,1
21379,Amy,2," Yes, he did. He absolutely did.",5,Big Bang Theory,32,6
21380,Penny,2," My God, Amy, that's really crappy of you.",5,Big Bang Theory,42,8
21381,Amy,2, It is?,5,Big Bang Theory,7,2
21382,Penny,2, Yeah! Letting Sheldon use you to manipulate me? I thought you were my friend.,5,Big Bang Theory,78,14
21383,Amy,2," No, I am your friend. Please don't be mad at me.",5,Big Bang Theory,49,11
21384,Penny,2," I can't even believe this. You know, maybe you should just go.",5,Big Bang Theory,63,12
21385,Amy,2," No, no, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. I take it all back. Look. I'm, uh, I'm sitting in your chair. There's nothing wrong with it. It's a great chair. Please let me continue to be part of your world. Ow!",5,Big Bang Theory,199,40
21386,Penny,2, What's wrong?,5,Big Bang Theory,14,2
21387,Amy,2, Something in the chair's biting my tushy. It's not important. Ow!,5,Big Bang Theory,66,11
21388,Penny,2," Wait. Get up, get up!  Swear you won't tell Sheldon what happened!",5,Big Bang Theory,67,12
21389,Amy,2, I swear! Can I tell my doctor? I'm probably gonna need shots!,5,Big Bang Theory,62,12
21390,Penny,2," Yeah, sure!",5,Big Bang Theory,12,2
21392,Leonard,2," Oh, hey, babe, I think I figured this thing out.",5,Big Bang Theory,49,10
21394,Leonard,2," No, you listen. You're my woman, and I'm gonna make you feel things you have never felt before.",5,Big Bang Theory,96,18
21396,Leonard,2," That's right, say my name, and beg me for more, 'cause, I'm gonna give it to you.",5,Big Bang Theory,82,17
21400,Howard,2, Check it out. Free chair.,5,Big Bang Theory,26,5
21401,Raj,2," Yeah. Hey, you know, if this was in Sheldon and Leonard's apartment, I wouldn't wind up sitting on the floor all the time.",5,Big Bang Theory,123,23
21402,Howard,2, On three?,5,Big Bang Theory,10,2
21404,Raj,2, What kind of idiot throws away a terrific chair like this?,5,Big Bang Theory,59,11
21406,Leonard,3, Who wants the last dumpling?,5,Big Bang Theory,29,5
21407,Penny,3," Ooh, me.",5,Big Bang Theory,9,2
21408,Sheldon,3," Penny, a moment. We just had Thai food. In that culture, the last morsel is called the krengjai piece, and it is reserved for the most important and valued member of the group.",5,Big Bang Theory,177,33
21409,Penny,3, Thank you all for this high honour.,5,Big Bang Theory,36,7
21410,Sheldon,3," I've seen pictures of your mother, keep eating.",5,Big Bang Theory,48,8
21411,Howard,3," All right, honey, if we're gonna make the movie, we should go.  This may be hard for you to hear, but when I say honey, I mean my fiancÃ©e.  Yeah, well, now it means her.",5,Big Bang Theory,171,35
21413,Howard,3," Fine. But next time, we get a sitter.",5,Big Bang Theory,38,8
21414,Penny,3," All right, I got to go to work. I'll walk down with you.",5,Big Bang Theory,57,13
21415,Sheldon,3," Wait. Uh, which is closer to the new train store in Monrovia, the movie theatre or the Cheesecake Factory?",5,Big Bang Theory,107,19
21416,Howard,3, Neither of them are close.,5,Big Bang Theory,27,5
21417,Sheldon,3," Oh, well, then I guess it doesn't matter which one of you drives me. Let's play a fun guessing game to see who gets to take me. All right, this four-letter word describes either a printer's type size or a compulsion to eat dirt.",5,Big Bang Theory,229,44
21418,Penny,3," Okay, I'm not driving him.",5,Big Bang Theory,27,5
21419,Sheldon,3," No, Penny, don't give up, you can get this.",5,Big Bang Theory,44,9
21420,Leonard,3, Aren't you going with Sheldon?,5,Big Bang Theory,31,5
21421,Amy,3," No, I have no interest in model trains, stores that sell them, nor their heartbreaking clientele.",5,Big Bang Theory,98,16
21422,Leonard,3," Oh. Well, I have some work to do, so",5,Big Bang Theory,37,9
21423,Amy,3, I can't imagine that would disturb me. Carry on.,5,Big Bang Theory,49,9
21424,Leonard,3, Okay. Wouldn't you be more comfortable at home?,5,Big Bang Theory,48,8
21425,Amy,3," Not really, no.",5,Big Bang Theory,16,3
21426,Leonard,3, All righty then. Guess I'll just get started.,5,Big Bang Theory,46,8
21427,Amy,3," Leonard, please. I don't need the running commentary.",5,Big Bang Theory,54,8
21429,Leonard,3, Amy?,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
21430,Amy,3, Yo.,5,Big Bang Theory,4,1
21431,Leonard,3, You okay?,5,Big Bang Theory,10,2
21432,Amy,3," Oh, sure.",5,Big Bang Theory,10,2
21433,Leonard,3, I thought you were reading.,5,Big Bang Theory,28,5
21434,Amy,3," I was. Now I'm thinking about what I read. You all right, Leonard? You seem very uncomfortable.",5,Big Bang Theory,96,17
21435,Leonard,3," I, I'm fine.",5,Big Bang Theory,13,3
21436,Amy,3, Should I go? I've been told sometimes I overstay my welcome.,5,Big Bang Theory,61,11
21437,Leonard,3," What, who told you that?",5,Big Bang Theory,25,5
21438,Amy,3," Well, most recently my gynaecologist.",5,Big Bang Theory,38,5
21439,Leonard,3," Well, you stay as long as you'd like.",5,Big Bang Theory,38,8
21440,Amy,3," I'm glad to hear you say that, because I'm having a wonderful time. Hmm, I said the same thing to my gynaecologist.",5,Big Bang Theory,116,22
21443,Sheldon,3," Oh, I'm not buying anything. They're having a lecture. H-O gauge railroading. Half the size of O-gauge, but twice the fun. Very controversial topic.",5,Big Bang Theory,149,24
21444,Howard,3, Which side do you come down on?,5,Big Bang Theory,32,7
21445,Sheldon,3," I'll let you know after tonight. Unlike some people, I'm going in with an open mind. Who am I kidding? Of course we all know it's O-gauge or no gauge.",5,Big Bang Theory,151,30
21446,Howard,3, Can you believe grown men sit around and play with toy trains?,5,Big Bang Theory,63,12
21448,Howard,3," First of all, they're not tricks, they're illusions. And, secondly, when we get married, they're all going up in the attic so you can have that closet for clothes.",5,Big Bang Theory,164,29
21450,Howard,3," Well, don't think of it that way. Once we move in, it'll be our house.",5,Big Bang Theory,71,15
21452,Howard,3, Why would she move out? It's her house.,5,Big Bang Theory,40,8
21454,Sheldon,3," Howard, I think I can help here. Yes, Bernadette, that's exactly what he thinks.",5,Big Bang Theory,81,14
21455,Howard,3," Why not? It's a great house, plenty of room, and if we have kids, Mom's there to help. You know, when she tells the Three Little Pigs story, she actually has hair on her chinny-chin-chin.",5,Big Bang Theory,188,35
21457,Howard,3," Wow, someone obviously has some mommy issues.",5,Big Bang Theory,46,7
21459,Howard,3, Don't listen to her. Go to the movie theatre.,5,Big Bang Theory,46,9
21461,Howard,3, Movie theatre.,5,Big Bang Theory,15,2
21462,Raj,3, Mmmmmm.,5,Big Bang Theory,8,1
21463,Sheldon,3," Okay, everybody calm down. There is a simple solution here. Raj, take me to the train store, and then I don't care what you people do.",5,Big Bang Theory,135,26
21465,Amy,3, How was your shower?,5,Big Bang Theory,21,4
21466,Leonard,3," It was good, good. Just out of curiosity, what time do you usually go to bed?",5,Big Bang Theory,78,16
21467,Amy,3," Oh, I'm up all night. I'm like a possum. Boy, you were not liked in high school, were you?",5,Big Bang Theory,91,19
21468,Leonard,3, Not really. Is that my yearbook?,5,Big Bang Theory,33,6
21469,Amy,3," Mm-hmm. Dear Leonard, you're really good at science. Maybe one day you'll come up with a cure for being a dork.",5,Big Bang Theory,112,21
21470,Leonard,3," Well, it wasn't spray-painting a lightning bolt on my briefcase, I can tell you that.",5,Big Bang Theory,86,15
21471,Amy,3," If it makes you feel any better, the only person who signed my yearbook was my mother.",5,Big Bang Theory,87,17
21472,Leonard,3, Aw.,5,Big Bang Theory,4,1
21473,Amy,3," Dear Amy, self-respect and a hymen are better than friends and fun. Love, Mom.",5,Big Bang Theory,79,14
21474,Sheldon,3," Well, you can add Jerry's Junction to the list of train stores Sheldon Cooper will never set foot in again.",5,Big Bang Theory,108,20
21475,Leonard,3," Rough night, Casey Jones?",5,Big Bang Theory,26,4
21476,Sheldon,3, You don't know the half of it. It was billed as a lively give-and-take on the merits of model train sizes. But it was actually a set-up to intimidate weak-minded spineless rubes into buying H-O starter sets.,5,Big Bang Theory,208,37
21477,Leonard,3, What's in the bag?,5,Big Bang Theory,19,4
21478,Sheldon,3," I don't want to talk about it. But it's not a spine,I'll tell you that.",5,Big Bang Theory,72,15
21479,Amy,3," Well, I had a delightful evening, Leonard. We should do this again sometime.",5,Big Bang Theory,77,13
21480,Leonard,3," Ah, sure. That'd be nice.",5,Big Bang Theory,26,5
21481,Amy,3, Glad to hear it. I need someone to accompany me to the wedding of Dr. Moranelli and Dr. Gustufson this Friday. They're kind of the Brad and Angelina of the primatology department.,5,Big Bang Theory,180,32
21482,Leonard,3, Wouldn't you rather bring Sheldon?,5,Big Bang Theory,35,5
21483,Amy,3," I would, but the last wedding we went to was a disaster. He behaved like a child the entire time.",5,Big Bang Theory,98,20
21484,Sheldon,3, Not my fault. You said there'd be other scientists there my age.,5,Big Bang Theory,65,12
21485,Amy,3," Doesn't matter. You're out, he's in. No date to the prom, two dates to a wedding. Hmm, how times change.",5,Big Bang Theory,105,20
21486,Sheldon,3," Ha-ha, you have to go to a wedding.",5,Big Bang Theory,36,8
21488,Howard,3, I'll get it!,5,Big Bang Theory,13,3
21490,Howard,3, I said I'm getting it!,5,Big Bang Theory,23,5
21492,Howard,3," I got it! Oh, hi.",5,Big Bang Theory,18,5
21494,Howard,3," Yeah, well, I'm sorry I didn't run it by you first.",5,Big Bang Theory,52,11
21496,Howard,3," The bugs only come here because you're their queen! Listen, how about this. Before we make any kind of decision about where we live, we have a trial run. Stay here for a weekend, see what it's like.",5,Big Bang Theory,199,38
21498,Howard,3," Sure she would. Ma, do you mind if Bernadette stays here this weekend?",5,Big Bang Theory,71,13
21500,Howard,3, See? She's good with it.,5,Big Bang Theory,25,5
21503,Sheldon,3," All this years, I've been so wrong. The tinier the train, the more concentrated the fun.",5,Big Bang Theory,89,16
21504,Penny,3, You're a brain scientist. Can you explain to me why a brilliant man likes playing with toy trains?,5,Big Bang Theory,99,18
21505,Amy,3," Not without cutting his head open, no. How about making my eyes like Cleopatra?",5,Big Bang Theory,80,14
21506,Penny,3, Really? For a wedding?,5,Big Bang Theory,23,4
21507,Amy,3, Perhaps you're right. My cheekbones and beckoning pelvis already have a certain hello sailor quality to them.,5,Big Bang Theory,110,17
21508,Leonard,3, Ready.,5,Big Bang Theory,7,1
21509,Penny,3, Aw. So handsome. Like James Bond.,5,Big Bang Theory,34,6
21510,Sheldon,3," Better than James Bond, because he's tinier.",5,Big Bang Theory,45,7
21511,Amy,3, I got you this to give to me.,5,Big Bang Theory,30,8
21512,Penny,3," Oh, sweetie, guests don't normally wear corsages to a wedding. That's more of a prom thing.",5,Big Bang Theory,92,16
21513,Amy,3," I never went to my prom. My mom paid my cousin to take me, but he just used the money to buy drugs.",5,Big Bang Theory,100,23
21514,Penny,3, Put the corsage on her.,5,Big Bang Theory,24,5
21515,Leonard,3," Amy, this is for you.",5,Big Bang Theory,22,5
21516,Amy,3," When you're done copping a feel, that goes on my wrist.",5,Big Bang Theory,56,11
21517,Sheldon,3, All aboard! Woo-woo! It's official. I'm an H-O trainiac.,5,Big Bang Theory,57,9
21519,Howard,3," So, dinner went nice.",5,Big Bang Theory,22,4
21521,Howard,3," Only when it's fatty. Well, don't be jealous, babe. Someday you'll get to cut it for me.",5,Big Bang Theory,89,17
21525,Howard,3," Hey, Ma, how about a little privacy?",5,Big Bang Theory,37,7
21528,Howard,3," Relax, it'll be fine.",5,Big Bang Theory,22,4
21532,Amy,3, Would you like to dance?,5,Big Bang Theory,25,5
21533,Leonard,3," No, thank you. I'm really not much of a dancer.",5,Big Bang Theory,48,10
21534,Amy,3," You're not exactly winning any trophies as a conversationalist, either.",5,Big Bang Theory,72,10
21535,Leonard,3, I'm sorry. The bride and groom seem happy.,5,Big Bang Theory,43,8
21536,Amy,3," Why shouldn't they be? They have a feverish night of socially-approved copulation ahead of them. In some cultures, we'd stand outside of their bedroom cheering as they achieved orgasm.",5,Big Bang Theory,185,29
21537,Leonard,3," That sounds like a late night, and I have work in the morning, so",5,Big Bang Theory,66,14
21538,Amy,3," Leonard, you may not have noticed, but I am being a delight here. And you're not holding up your end of the evening.",5,Big Bang Theory,117,23
21539,Leonard,3," Oh, sorry. This wedding just reminds me of my kinda-sorta girlfriend 9,000 miles away.",5,Big Bang Theory,87,14
21540,Amy,3," I have a kinda-sorta boyfriend who's playing with a model train right now, you don't hear me bitching about it. Leonard, a word of advice, moody self-obsession is only attractive in men who can play guitar and are considerably taller than you.",5,Big Bang Theory,244,42
21541,Leonard,3, I'm not moody. I'm fun.,5,Big Bang Theory,24,5
21542,Amy,3, You have any evidence to support that statement?,5,Big Bang Theory,49,8
21543,Leonard,3," Well, hey, I'm just as much fun as you are.",5,Big Bang Theory,44,10
21544,Amy,3, Really? Are you willing to draw a moustache on your finger as a conversational icebreaker? I am.,5,Big Bang Theory,97,17
21545,Leonard,3," Okay, fine, what do you suggest?",5,Big Bang Theory,33,6
21546,Amy,3," We just had a lovely meal, the band is on fire, and you're sitting next to a beautiful woman wearing whorish makeup. Why don't we head outon the dance floor and see if I can sweat through these dress shields.",5,Big Bang Theory,209,40
21547,Leonard,3," Once again, I, I'm really not much of a dancer.",5,Big Bang Theory,48,10
21548,Amy,3," Don't worry, I'll lead. ",5,Big Bang Theory,25,4
21550,Amy,3, Howard?,5,Big Bang Theory,8,1
21551,Howard,3, Ready for bed?,5,Big Bang Theory,15,3
21553,Howard,3," Oh. Yeah, she sometimes has problems doing her business. Hang on. Ma, give up! Tonight's not your night!",5,Big Bang Theory,105,18
21555,Howard,3," Come on, take a break! Bernadette needs to brush her teeth!",5,Big Bang Theory,60,11
21557,Howard,3, Problem solved.,5,Big Bang Theory,16,2
21559,Howard,3," Oh, come on, honey. She's just sitting in there reading a magazine. You can't see anything. I go in all the time.",5,Big Bang Theory,114,22
21561,Howard,3," And we have splashdown. Wait here, I'm gonna go light a candle. And then we make passionate love.",5,Big Bang Theory,98,18
21563,Amy,3," There we go, last floor.",5,Big Bang Theory,25,5
21564,Leonard,3," I just can't figure out what happened. I put my left leg in, I took my left leg out, I put my left leg in, and something just snapped.",5,Big Bang Theory,135,29
21565,Amy,3, The hokey pokey is a young man's game.,5,Big Bang Theory,39,8
21566,Leonard,3, I did have a great time. Thank you for reminding me it's okay to have fun once in a while.,5,Big Bang Theory,91,20
21567,Amy,3, You're welcome.,5,Big Bang Theory,16,2
21568,Leonard,3, And also for breaking the head off the ice swan so I could hold it against my pulled groin.,5,Big Bang Theory,92,19
21569,Amy,3," I excel at spatial reasoning, and I had a hunch that the graceful slope of its neck would cradle your genitals nicely.",5,Big Bang Theory,119,22
21570,Leonard,3," Well, okay. Again, thank you.",5,Big Bang Theory,30,5
21571,Amy,3," And again, you're welcome.",5,Big Bang Theory,27,4
21572,Leonard,3," Want to come in, have a cup of tea?",5,Big Bang Theory,36,9
21573,Amy,3," No, thanks. I'm gonna head home.",5,Big Bang Theory,33,6
21574,Leonard,3," Okay. Well, good night.",5,Big Bang Theory,24,4
21575,Amy,3, Good night. ,5,Big Bang Theory,13,2
21576,Penny,3," Ames, hi. How was the wedding?",5,Big Bang Theory,31,6
21577,Amy,3, Great. Until I accidentally made Leonard fall in love with me.,5,Big Bang Theory,63,11
21578,Penny,3," Come in, let's talk. Do you want a glass of wine?",5,Big Bang Theory,50,11
21579,Amy,3, Wine is one of the reasons I'm in this fix. That and this dang pelvis.,5,Big Bang Theory,71,15
21580,Penny,3," Okay, I'm sorry, what exactly happened?",5,Big Bang Theory,40,6
21581,Amy,3," The inevitable, he was lonely and vulnerable from missing his girlfriend, while I was charming, supportive and, let's face it, in this dress, the perfect combination of Madonna and whore.",5,Big Bang Theory,188,30
21582,Penny,3," Oh, God, did he make a move on you?",5,Big Bang Theory,36,9
21583,Amy,3," No, but it's only a matter of time. How could I have not seen this coming? Now I'm gonna have to break the little sad sack's heart.",5,Big Bang Theory,132,27
21584,Penny,3," Yeah, I'm sure he'll be okay.",5,Big Bang Theory,30,6
21585,Amy,3," Oh, Penny, much as I would treasure knowing that the two of us had been defiled by the same man, Leonard just doesn't get my motor running.",5,Big Bang Theory,140,27
21586,Penny,3," So, um, what are you gonna do? Do you want me to talk to Leonard, let him down easy?",5,Big Bang Theory,85,19
21587,Amy,3," No. I'll let him have tonight. Then in the morning, I'll send him an e-mail letting him know this body is never gonna be his wonderland. I mean, frankly, you've got a better shot than he does.",5,Big Bang Theory,193,37
21589,Sheldon,3," Leonard. Check it out. I bought an N-gauge locomotive. Half the size of H-O. Look, it fits in my mouth.",5,Big Bang Theory,104,20
21590,Leonard,3, Sounds like you had a great night.,5,Big Bang Theory,35,7
21591,Sheldon,3, I did. How was yours?,5,Big Bang Theory,22,5
21592,Leonard,3, Not bad. I had a lot more fun with Amy than I thought I would.,5,Big Bang Theory,63,15
21593,Sheldon,3, What exactly do you mean by that?,5,Big Bang Theory,34,7
21594,Leonard,3," Well, it turns out she really knows how to help a guy loosen up and have a good time. Although, truth be told, my groin's a little worse for wear.  Ow! Why did you do that?",5,Big Bang Theory,173,36
21595,Sheldon,3, To send a message. She is not for you.,5,Big Bang Theory,39,9
21596,Leonard,3, What?,5,Big Bang Theory,6,1
21597,Sheldon,3, Not for you!,5,Big Bang Theory,13,3
21600,Howard,3," Morning, Mom.",5,Big Bang Theory,14,2
21602,Howard,3," Yes, it is, and you're so pretty in the morning.",5,Big Bang Theory,49,10
21604,Howard,3," Oh, wow. So you guys are getting along?",5,Big Bang Theory,40,8
21608,Howard,3, Is there any butter?,5,Big Bang Theory,21,4
21610,Howard,3, Oh.,5,Big Bang Theory,4,1
21615,Howard,3, I don't need any butter.,5,Big Bang Theory,25,5
21617,Howard,3," Well, I guess I'll cut these by myself.",5,Big Bang Theory,40,8
21619,Sheldon,4," The entrance to the dungeon is a moss covered door. You manage to open it only to find yourself face-to-face with a hideous, foul-smelling, moss-covered ogre. What do you do?",5,Big Bang Theory,175,30
21620,Howard,4," I say, hey Ma, what's for dinner?â€ù",5,Big Bang Theory,37,7
21621,Sheldon,4," Seventeen. The ogre is amused by your joke and allows you to pass. By the by, I liked it, too.",5,Big Bang Theory,95,20
21622,Leonard,4," Hey, how go the wedding plans, Howard?",5,Big Bang Theory,39,7
21623,Howard,4, Great. We spent five hours last night at Macy's registering for gifts. Looks like I'm finally going to have that darling little earthenware asparagus dish I've always wanted.,5,Big Bang Theory,175,28
21624,Leonard,4," See, this is the good thing about having a girlfriend 9,000 miles away. I can spend my nights doing whatever I want.",5,Big Bang Theory,117,22
21625,Howard,4, You mean like playing nerd games with us and then taking a suspiciously long shower?,5,Big Bang Theory,85,15
21626,Leonard,4, Maybe. We enter the dungeon.,5,Big Bang Theory,29,5
21627,Sheldon,4, You see a dragon.,5,Big Bang Theory,18,4
21628,Howard,4," Really? So we're playing Dungeons and Dragons, and we walk into a dungeon and see a dragon? Isn't that a little on the nose?",5,Big Bang Theory,125,24
21629,Sheldon,4," When you play Chutes and Ladders, do you complain about all the chutes and all the ladders?",5,Big Bang Theory,92,17
21630,Leonard,4, Are you gonna eat that whole pie?,5,Big Bang Theory,34,7
21631,Raj,4, Maybe. Why not? Who do I have in my life to watch my figure for?,5,Big Bang Theory,65,15
21632,Leonard,4," Oh, God, did you watch Bridget Jones again?",5,Big Bang Theory,44,8
21633,Raj,4," No, it's just that everybody's got someone. Sheldon's with Amy, Howard's getting married, you're dating my sister.",5,Big Bang Theory,115,17
21634,Leonard,4," Now that Howard's getting married, maybe he'll inflate one of his old girlfriends for you.",5,Big Bang Theory,91,15
21635,Raj,4, You know who I blame for my loneliness? The United States of America. Your movies and your TV shows promised streets paved with beautiful blonde women with big bazongas.,5,Big Bang Theory,170,29
21636,Howard,4," Eat another pie, you'll have your own bazongas.",5,Big Bang Theory,48,8
21637,Raj,4, That's cruel. You know it goes straight to my hips.,5,Big Bang Theory,52,10
21638,Sheldon,4," Gentlemen, please focus. You're facing a fire-breathing dragon.",5,Big Bang Theory,64,8
21639,Raj,4, I don't know if I want to play anymore.,5,Big Bang Theory,40,9
21640,Sheldon,4," Because you don't have a girlfriend? Well, good Lord, if that becomes a reason not to play Dungeons and Dragons, this game's in serious trouble.",5,Big Bang Theory,145,25
21642,Amy,4," Now, I assume we use this same wax later on to neaten up each other's bikini regions.",5,Big Bang Theory,86,17
21643,Penny,4," Yeah, my bikini region is fine.",5,Big Bang Theory,32,6
21644,Amy,4," Who's shocked? I'm not. So, Bernadette, how's the wedding planning going? And I'm not asking as a prospective bridesmaid. Pick me! Pick me!",5,Big Bang Theory,140,23
21646,Penny,4," Oh, the poor guy's so lonely. We should set him up with someone.",5,Big Bang Theory,65,13
21648,Penny,4," Well, hello? She's married.",5,Big Bang Theory,28,4
21650,Penny,4," Okay, so future grief-stricken widow is the one to beat.",5,Big Bang Theory,57,10
21652,Leonard,4, Are we ready to order?,5,Big Bang Theory,23,5
21653,Sheldon,4, One moment. I'm conducting an experiment.,5,Big Bang Theory,42,6
21654,Howard,4, With Dungeons and Dragons dice?,5,Big Bang Theory,32,5
21655,Sheldon,4," Yes. From here on in, I've decided to make all trivial decisions with a throw of the dice, thus freeing up my mind to do what it does best, enlighten and amaze. Page 14, item seven.",5,Big Bang Theory,182,36
21656,Howard,4," So, what's for dinner?",5,Big Bang Theory,23,4
21657,Sheldon,4, A side of corn succotash. Hmm. Interesting.,5,Big Bang Theory,44,7
21658,Penny,4," Um, Howard, can I see you for a minute, please?",5,Big Bang Theory,48,10
21659,Howard,4," Uh, I don't want to show any more of your friends how I can fit in the booster seats.",5,Big Bang Theory,86,19
21660,Penny,4," Uh, no, that's not it. Just come with me, please.",5,Big Bang Theory,50,10
21661,Sheldon,4, Let's see what I'll be washing that succotash down with. A pitcher of margaritas.,5,Big Bang Theory,82,14
21662,Leonard,4, Do you really want that?,5,Big Bang Theory,25,5
21663,Sheldon,4, That's the great thing. It doesn't matter. My mind is freed up to think about more important things.,5,Big Bang Theory,101,18
21664,Raj,4, What's it thinking about now?,5,Big Bang Theory,30,5
21665,Sheldon,4, Hamburgers and lemonade.,5,Big Bang Theory,25,3
21666,Penny,4," Um, Raj, there's someone I want you to meet. This is my friend Emily. I know her from my spin class. Raj, relax. She can't hear you. She's deaf.",5,Big Bang Theory,145,29
21667,Howard,4," Emily, this is our friend Raj.",5,Big Bang Theory,31,6
21668,Penny,4, Oh! Look at you guys just hitting it off. I am so good.,5,Big Bang Theory,56,13
21669,Raj,4, Hi.,5,Big Bang Theory,4,1
21670,Howard,4, She says it's nice to meet you.,5,Big Bang Theory,32,7
21671,Raj,4, Does she really mean that or was she signing it sarcastically?,5,Big Bang Theory,63,11
21672,Howard,4," Raj says it's nice to meet you, too. She says she has to go back to her family, but Penny has her number if you want to text her and get together.",5,Big Bang Theory,147,32
21673,Raj,4," Okay, I'm going to play it cool. Tell her, maybe. Whatever, babe.",5,Big Bang Theory,66,12
21674,Howard,4, He'll text you.,5,Big Bang Theory,16,3
21675,Raj,4," Ah, look at that. I have a date. I love America again.",5,Big Bang Theory,55,12
21676,Sheldon,4," And now for dessert, come on, hot fudge sundae, come on, hot fudge sundae. Bam! That's what I'm talking about!",5,Big Bang Theory,111,20
21678,Raj,4," Okay, as soon as she gets here, so she knows I'm cool with it, I'm going to make a joke about her being deaf. I was thinking, hey, did you hear the one about? Oh, no, I bet you didn't.",5,Big Bang Theory,185,40
21679,Howard,4, Maybe we should revisit your lonely fat guy plan.,5,Big Bang Theory,50,9
21680,Raj,4," Oh, she's here.",5,Big Bang Theory,16,3
21681,Howard,4," No joke. Oh, she says she's sorry she's late.",5,Big Bang Theory,46,9
21682,Raj,4," Tell her it doesn't matter. Tell her, her eyes shimmer like opalescent lilies in the lake of the palace of the celestial maidens.",5,Big Bang Theory,130,23
21683,Howard,4, Really? That's the first thing you want to say?,5,Big Bang Theory,48,9
21684,Raj,4, I worked on it all night. Use it.,5,Big Bang Theory,34,8
21685,Howard,4," Look, I don't know the sign for opalescent.",5,Big Bang Theory,44,8
21686,Raj,4, Then spell it.,5,Big Bang Theory,15,3
21687,Howard,4, I don't know how to spell it.,5,Big Bang Theory,30,7
21688,Raj,4, You're blowing this for me!,5,Big Bang Theory,28,5
21689,Howard,4, He likes your eyes.,5,Big Bang Theory,20,4
21690,Raj,4, You're making me sound like a caveman.,5,Big Bang Theory,39,7
21691,Howard,4," She says, thank you, you have nice eyes, too.â€ù",5,Big Bang Theory,49,9
21692,Raj,4," Really? Ask her how many children she wants, and whatever number she says, say, me too.",5,Big Bang Theory,88,16
21693,Howard,4, No.,5,Big Bang Theory,4,1
21694,Raj,4," Fine. Tell her I have a deep, sexy voice like James Earl Jones.",5,Big Bang Theory,64,13
21695,Howard,4, She doesn't know what James Earl Jones sounds like.,5,Big Bang Theory,52,9
21696,Raj,4, Great. Then she won't know I'm lying.,5,Big Bang Theory,38,7
21698,Raj,4," Let's see, what else can I tell you about me that would make you like me? Ooh, I love music. Do you love music?",5,Big Bang Theory,112,24
21699,Howard,4, You really want to ask her that?,5,Big Bang Theory,33,7
21700,Raj,4, You're right. Everyone loves music.,5,Big Bang Theory,36,5
21701,Howard,4," She says, do you play an instrument?",5,Big Bang Theory,37,7
21702,Raj,4," No, but when I was six years old, I tried to start a boy band called Frankie Goes to Bollywood. But I couldn't get any other boys to join, so my parents asked the servants to be my backup dancers. Wait, when you sign servants, don't sign it like I'm bragging. Sign it in a way that I sound humble with just a hint of, that's right, I had servants.",5,Big Bang Theory,348,70
21703,Howard,4, Do you hear yourself,5,Big Bang Theory,21,4
21704,Raj,4," Yes, but she doesn't. So get signing, hand monkey.",5,Big Bang Theory,51,9
21706,Howard,4," I think I wrote a letter to Santa Claus every day. And then on Christmas morning, under the tree is a little puppy with a red ribbon.",5,Big Bang Theory,134,27
21707,Raj,4, What are you doing?,5,Big Bang Theory,20,4
21708,Howard,4, Texting Bernadette that I'm gonna be late.,5,Big Bang Theory,43,7
21709,Raj,4," Dude, what is she saying?",5,Big Bang Theory,26,5
21710,Howard,4," It's a funny story about a puppy. Just smile and laugh. Quick, quick, stop smiling.",5,Big Bang Theory,84,15
21711,Raj,4, What? Why?,5,Big Bang Theory,11,2
21712,Howard,4," The puppy died, it choked on a doll head. Sad face, sad face!",5,Big Bang Theory,62,13
21714,Raj,4," It's a little hard to see with the city lights, but that W-shaped constellation is Cassiopeia. And she was the mother of Andromeda who's over there.",5,Big Bang Theory,149,26
21715,Howard,4," Look, pretty stars. This is her car. She hopes she can see you again sometime.",5,Big Bang Theory,79,15
21716,Raj,4," Good, good. Oh, boy, help me out here. Does she want me to kiss her or not?",5,Big Bang Theory,76,17
21717,Howard,4," I speak sign language, I don't read minds.",5,Big Bang Theory,43,8
21718,Raj,4," If you were me, would you kiss her?",5,Big Bang Theory,36,8
21719,Howard,4," Yeah, but I'm a make out king. ",5,Big Bang Theory,32,7
21720,Raj,4, I was so smooth on that date.,5,Big Bang Theory,30,7
21721,Howard,4, You? I made you smooth. You were an idiot.,5,Big Bang Theory,43,9
21722,Raj,4," Whatever, dude. She kissed me.",5,Big Bang Theory,31,5
21723,Howard,4," It might've been on your lips, but it was my kiss.",5,Big Bang Theory,51,11
21724,Raj,4," Oh, fine. Let's agree she kissed both of us.",5,Big Bang Theory,45,9
21725,Howard,4, Okay.,5,Big Bang Theory,6,1
21727,Penny,4," Mustache is looking good there, Sheldon.",5,Big Bang Theory,41,6
21728,Sheldon,4, Don't thank me. Thank the dice. They told me what percentage of my face to shave.,5,Big Bang Theory,82,16
21729,Howard,4, Why are you still doing this?,5,Big Bang Theory,30,6
21730,Sheldon,4," Because it's working. In the past few weeks, unburdened by trivial decisions, I've co-authored two papers in notable peer-reviewed journals, and I'm close to figuring out why the Large Hadron Collider has yet to isolate the Higgs boson particle.",5,Big Bang Theory,246,39
21731,Leonard,4," You left out, got chafed testicles because you no longer wear underpants.",5,Big Bang Theory,74,12
21732,Sheldon,4, The dice giveth and the dice taketh away.,5,Big Bang Theory,42,8
21733,Penny,4, Is Raj out with Emily again?,5,Big Bang Theory,29,6
21734,Leonard,4," Yeah, every night for the last month.",5,Big Bang Theory,38,7
21735,Penny,4," Wow, can't believe he has a girlfriend.",5,Big Bang Theory,40,7
21736,Sheldon,4, Me neither.,5,Big Bang Theory,12,2
21737,Howard,4, Here's some other fun news on the Raj/Emily front. He gave her a pair of diamond earrings and leased her a car.,5,Big Bang Theory,112,22
21738,Penny,4, You're kidding.,5,Big Bang Theory,16,2
21739,Leonard,4, You think she's taking advantage of him?,5,Big Bang Theory,41,7
21740,Penny,4," Oh, of course not. She wouldn't do something like that. She's deaf.",5,Big Bang Theory,68,12
21741,Leonard,4, Deaf women can't be gold diggers?,5,Big Bang Theory,34,6
21742,Penny,4," Handicapped people are nice, Leonard. Everyone knows that.",5,Big Bang Theory,59,8
21743,Sheldon,4," Yeah, I actually have information about Raj that would be helpful with this discussion.",5,Big Bang Theory,88,14
21744,Leonard,4, Could you tell us?,5,Big Bang Theory,19,4
21745,Sheldon,4," Let's see.  Snake eyes. Sorry, bud.",5,Big Bang Theory,36,6
21746,Penny,4," Wait, hang on. Doubles. Roll again.",5,Big Bang Theory,36,6
21747,Sheldon,4," Okay, get this. It doesn't matter if he's showering her with gifts, because the Koothrappalis are vastly wealthy.",5,Big Bang Theory,114,18
21748,Penny,4," What do you mean, vastly wealthy?",5,Big Bang Theory,34,6
21749,Sheldon,4," Well, wealthy means a lot of money, and vastly means even more. I'm not sure what's tripping you up.",5,Big Bang Theory,101,19
21750,Leonard,4," Look, I know they have money. I don't think it's that much.",5,Big Bang Theory,60,12
21751,Sheldon,4," No, you're wrong. See, as you know, a few years ago, I achieved one of my lesser dreams and became a notary public. Well, from time to time, I notarize banking documents for Raj. The Koothrappalis aren't just rich, they're Richie Rich rich.",5,Big Bang Theory,241,43
21752,Penny,4," Well, so how much is that?",5,Big Bang Theory,27,6
21753,Sheldon,4, About halfway between Bruce Wayne and Scrooge McDuck.,5,Big Bang Theory,54,8
21754,Howard,4," What the hell? The last time we went to the zoo, that son of a bitch made me buy him a churro.",5,Big Bang Theory,95,22
21755,Leonard,4," Listen, guys, I'm sorry, I don't mean to be rude, but I need to go call Raj's sister, who I love so much. So vastly much.",5,Big Bang Theory,122,26
21756,Penny,4," Okay, so he's got money, and it's a few gifts and a car.",5,Big Bang Theory,57,13
21757,Howard,4, And she got him to pay off all her credit cards.,5,Big Bang Theory,49,11
21758,Penny,4," What? He paid off her credit cards? Damn it, I could've dated Raj for a couple months. But I, I wouldn't have, because I'm not that kind of girl. We should really talk to Raj.",5,Big Bang Theory,176,35
21759,Howard,4," He's not going to listen, he's in love.",5,Big Bang Theory,40,8
21760,Sheldon,4," Can't figure out what to do? I remember those days. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to  stay right here.",5,Big Bang Theory,106,21
21762,Howard,4," Yeah, this is a bad idea. We should go.",5,Big Bang Theory,40,9
21763,Penny,4, No. I'm the one that introduced him to her. I've got to say something.,5,Big Bang Theory,71,14
21764,Howard,4, Wow.,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
21765,Penny,4, You're engaged to my friend.,5,Big Bang Theory,29,5
21766,Howard,4," Hey, Bernadette doesn't mind where I get my motor running, as long as I park in the right garage.",5,Big Bang Theory,98,19
21767,Penny,4," I can't believe you're engaged to my friend. Oh, here she comes.",5,Big Bang Theory,65,12
21768,Howard,4, Smart. Whisper so the deaf chick can't hear you.,5,Big Bang Theory,49,9
21769,Penny,4, Hi.,5,Big Bang Theory,4,1
21770,Howard,4," Oh, hey, hi. Nice to see you.",5,Big Bang Theory,30,7
21771,Penny,4," Um, can we talk to you about Raj?",5,Big Bang Theory,34,8
21772,Howard,4," She says, sure, what about him?",5,Big Bang Theory,32,6
21773,Penny,4," Okay, um, gosh, how do I start? Um, see, Raj is kind of naive. I mean, he hasn't dated a whole lot of women. And I'm concerned that, without meaning to, you might be taking advantage of him. You know, by letting him buy you a bunch of expensive things.And I.. I Howard, focus. Tell her what I'm saying.",5,Big Bang Theory,303,59
21774,Howard,4," Right. Are you a gold digger or not? Oh, uh, something, something, who the something do you think you are? Mind your own something business and go something yourself. Oh, wait, I got this now.",5,Big Bang Theory,193,35
21776,Raj,4, I'm so mad at you!,5,Big Bang Theory,19,5
21777,Penny,4," Okay, wait",5,Big Bang Theory,11,2
21778,Raj,4, How dare you ambush my girlfriend at the gym!,5,Big Bang Theory,46,9
21779,Penny,4," We didn't mean for it to be an ambush. Just, it's kind of impossible not to sneak up on deaf people. And hey, since when are you so chatty?",5,Big Bang Theory,140,29
21780,Raj,4, I'm hammered.,5,Big Bang Theory,14,2
21781,Penny,4," Raj, come here. This girl is trouble. I mean, what kind of relationship is it where you buy her gifts and she gives you sex?",5,Big Bang Theory,125,25
21782,Raj,4, The best one I ever had!,5,Big Bang Theory,25,6
21783,Penny,4," Okay, come on. You know you can do better.",5,Big Bang Theory,43,9
21784,Raj,4," Aha. I see what's going on here. You and I had our crazy night together, and now you can't stand to see me with another woman.",5,Big Bang Theory,127,26
21785,Penny,4," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!",5,Big Bang Theory,24,4
21786,Raj,4, It's okay. I can't get mad at your feelings.,5,Big Bang Theory,45,9
21787,Penny,4, I don't have feelings.,5,Big Bang Theory,23,4
21788,Raj,4," Yeah, that's good. Keep telling yourself that. ",5,Big Bang Theory,48,7
21789,Penny,4, He is cuter now that I know he's rich.,5,Big Bang Theory,39,9
21791,Raj,4," I have a surprise for you. Cover your eyes. Open them. It's a real ruby. It was a little expensive, but no one can put a price on love. Although, the people at Cartier took a pretty good shot at it.  Oh, Mummy, Daddy. What a nice surprise.",5,Big Bang Theory,240,48
21794,Raj,4, Penny?,5,Big Bang Theory,7,1
21796,Raj,4," I just got her a couple of things. She gives me things, too.",5,Big Bang Theory,61,13
21799,Raj,4, What? You're going to make me choose between the woman I love and the money I have very strong feelings for?,5,Big Bang Theory,109,21
21801,Raj,4," Well, I choose love.",5,Big Bang Theory,21,4
21803,Raj,4," My parents are making me choose between money and you. I choose you.  No, I think we'll have to return the car.  And that necklace, yeah, that, too. But none of those things matter, because we have something better. We have love.",5,Big Bang Theory,230,42
21805,Raj,4," Oh, Penny, I hurt so bad.",5,Big Bang Theory,26,6
21806,Penny,4," I know, I know.",5,Big Bang Theory,16,4
21807,Raj,4, Sometimes I put the TV on mute just to pretend she's still with me. But I can't watch the closed captioning without crying.,5,Big Bang Theory,124,23
21808,Penny,4," Oh, I'm so sorry. I wish I could make you feel better.",5,Big Bang Theory,55,12
21809,Raj,4, Seriously? I'm heartbroken and you're hitting on me?,5,Big Bang Theory,53,8
21810,Penny,4, What? No!,5,Big Bang Theory,10,2
21811,Raj,4," Look, Penny, you're great, but I had a long talk with my parents, and they said if I date an Indian girl, I get a Maserati.",5,Big Bang Theory,124,26
21813,Raj,4," Mmm. Oh, cheesecake, you're just as good as a woman, even though I can't have sex with you.",5,Big Bang Theory,92,18
21814,Howard,4, Try throwing it in the microwave for a few seconds.,5,Big Bang Theory,52,10
21815,Sheldon,4," Should I use the rest room or wait until we get home? Come on, papa needs to void his bladder. Oh, that's not what you want to see after three buttermilks.",5,Big Bang Theory,156,31
21816,Penny,4," Here you go, boys. I'll pick it up when you're ready.",5,Big Bang Theory,54,11
21817,Howard,4," Thanks for dinner, buddy.",5,Big Bang Theory,26,4
21818,Leonard,4," Yeah, real big of you.",5,Big Bang Theory,23,5
21819,Sheldon,4," Hurry, hurry, hurry.",5,Big Bang Theory,21,3
21820,Penny,4," Oh, and don't cheap out on the tip. We all know you're loaded now.",5,Big Bang Theory,67,14
21822,Leonard,5, It's from Game of Thrones. What do you think?,5,Big Bang Theory,46,9
21823,Sheldon,5," I don't know. If we're going to start a fantasy sword collection, and I've long thought we should, is this really the sword to start with?",5,Big Bang Theory,139,26
21824,Leonard,5, What did you have in mind?,5,Big Bang Theory,27,6
21825,Sheldon,5," Well, off the top of my head, I'd have to go with Excalibur. It gives you the right to rule England.",5,Big Bang Theory,101,21
21826,Leonard,5, It would be a replica of a movie prop.,5,Big Bang Theory,39,9
21827,Sheldon,5, Fair enough. It'd give you the right to rule a replica of England.,5,Big Bang Theory,67,13
21828,Leonard,5," Well, they don't have an Excalibur here, so what do you want to do?",5,Big Bang Theory,68,14
21829,Sheldon,5," Mm. Tough decision. There's no weaponry from Lord of the Rings, forged in a Chinese sweatshop?",5,Big Bang Theory,95,16
21830,Leonard,5, Just Bilbo Baggins' sword over there.,5,Big Bang Theory,38,6
21831,Sheldon,5," Two grown men with a hobbit's dagger; wouldn't we look silly? Okay, let's go for it.",5,Big Bang Theory,85,16
21833,Leonard,5," Yeah. It's okay, I guess.",5,Big Bang Theory,26,5
21834,Sheldon,5, Okay? It's magnificent.,5,Big Bang Theory,24,3
21835,Leonard,5, Buh-buh-buh-buh! What do you want for it?,5,Big Bang Theory,42,7
21837,Leonard,5," Oh, that's pretty steep.",5,Big Bang Theory,25,4
21839,Sheldon,5," Only 8,000? We're wasting precious time. Buy it.",5,Big Bang Theory,49,8
21840,Leonard,5, Hang on. Can you do any better?,5,Big Bang Theory,32,7
21842,Sheldon,5," Oh, did you hear that? We're getting the friends and family discount. We are honoured and we will take it.",5,Big Bang Theory,107,20
21843,Leonard,5, Slow down. Two hundred.,5,Big Bang Theory,24,4
21844,Sheldon,5, What are you doing? Two fifty is already the discounted price.,5,Big Bang Theory,63,11
21845,Leonard,5, Will you shut up?,5,Big Bang Theory,18,4
21847,Leonard,5, Nope. Maybe another time.,5,Big Bang Theory,26,4
21849,Sheldon,5," Take it, take it.",5,Big Bang Theory,18,4
21850,Leonard,5, Two hundred.,5,Big Bang Theory,13,2
21852,Sheldon,5, Killing you? I can't breathe.,5,Big Bang Theory,30,5
21854,Sheldon,5," Oh, now, we can't let him lose money, Leonard. I'm so sorry.",5,Big Bang Theory,61,12
21855,Leonard,5, Two ten and you throw in the Iron Man helmet.,5,Big Bang Theory,46,10
21857,Leonard,5, So?,5,Big Bang Theory,4,1
21859,Leonard,5," Okay, fine. Just the sword, two ten.",5,Big Bang Theory,37,7
21861,Leonard,5, See that? I just saved us forty bucks.,5,Big Bang Theory,39,8
21862,Sheldon,5," I've long said, what you lack in academic knowledge you make up for in street smarts.",5,Big Bang Theory,86,16
21864,Leonard,5," No, it's okay. I'm gonna stab my friend in the chest.",5,Big Bang Theory,54,11
21867,Sheldon,5," Hello, Wil Wheaton.",5,Big Bang Theory,20,3
21869,Sheldon,5, It's part of my sword collection. Do you have a sword collection?,5,Big Bang Theory,66,12
21871,Sheldon,5, I'm not surprised.,5,Big Bang Theory,19,3
21876,Sheldon,5, Sucker. Didn't even ask for the friends and family discount.,5,Big Bang Theory,61,10
21882,Leonard,5, Thank you.,5,Big Bang Theory,11,2
21884,Sheldon,5," I see what you're doing. You accept an invitation to a party at the home of my sworn enemy, he tells everyone we're going to be there, and when we don't show, he looks the fool. Fiendishly clever.",5,Big Bang Theory,197,38
21885,Leonard,5, I was actually thinking about going.,5,Big Bang Theory,37,6
21886,Sheldon,5," And then declaring the party a fiasco and storming out, leaving him humiliated in front of his guests. Love it.",5,Big Bang Theory,112,20
21887,Leonard,5," No, I was gonna grab Raj and Howard and have a good time.",5,Big Bang Theory,58,13
21890,Leonard,5," Sheldon, can you grab me a water?",5,Big Bang Theory,34,7
21891,Sheldon,5, Possibly.,5,Big Bang Theory,10,1
21892,Leonard,5, Can you or can't you?,5,Big Bang Theory,22,5
21893,Sheldon,5," It's not that simple, Leonard.",5,Big Bang Theory,31,5
21894,Leonard,5," It never is, is it?",5,Big Bang Theory,20,5
21895,Sheldon,5," At this moment, our relationship exists in two mutually contradictory states. Until you either do not go or go to Wil Wheaton's party, you are simultaneously my friend and not my friend. I'm characterizing this phenomenon as Schrodinger's Friendship.",5,Big Bang Theory,251,39
21896,Leonard,5, Got it. Can I have my water?,5,Big Bang Theory,29,7
21897,Sheldon,5," Of course. Now get it yourself, you traitor.",5,Big Bang Theory,45,8
21898,Penny,5," Wait, what is going on?",5,Big Bang Theory,24,5
21899,Sheldon,5," In case you have forgotten, Schrodinger's cat is a thought experiment",5,Big Bang Theory,70,11
21900,Penny,5," No, no, no, no, I didn't forget. Um, there's this cat in a box and until you open it, it's either dead or alive or both. Although, back in Nebraska, our cat got stuck in my brother's camp trunk, and we did not need to open it to know there was all kinds of dead cat in there.",5,Big Bang Theory,276,58
21901,Amy,5," Homespun stories, knowledge of physics and a bosom that defies it. You're the whole package, aren't you?",5,Big Bang Theory,105,17
21902,Howard,5," Sorry I'm late. Uh, I got great news. NASA picked my team's design for the deep field space telescope that's going on the International Space Station this spring.",5,Big Bang Theory,163,28
21905,Howard,5," It gets better. Someone has to go up with the telescope as a payload specialist, and guess who that someone is.",5,Big Bang Theory,112,21
21906,Sheldon,5, Mohammed Lee.,5,Big Bang Theory,14,2
21907,Howard,5, Who's Mohammed Lee?,5,Big Bang Theory,20,3
21908,Sheldon,5," Mohammed is the most common first name in the world, Lee, the most common surname. As I didn't know the answer, I thought that gave me a mathematical edge.",5,Big Bang Theory,156,29
21909,Howard,5," It's me, Sheldon. It's me. I'm going up in space! Technically, I'm an astronaut.",5,Big Bang Theory,81,14
21912,Howard,5," Oh, well, it's really cool. You fly to Moscow, they take you out to Kazakhstan, and then you get into a Russian Soyuz rocket which shoots you into a low earth orbit. Or just sits there on the launch pad because the Kazakhi mafia sold the rocket fuel on the black market.",5,Big Bang Theory,271,52
21914,Howard,5," Well, I mean, safe as it can be when it was built by the good folks who brought you Chernobyl.",5,Big Bang Theory,95,20
21915,Leonard,5," I'd like to propose a toast. The dream to go up into space is one we all share, and Howard's making that a reality. We're all very proud of you.",5,Big Bang Theory,145,30
21917,Sheldon,5, That was a lovely toast. Kudos.,5,Big Bang Theory,32,6
21918,Leonard,5, Thank you.,5,Big Bang Theory,11,2
21919,Sheldon,5," Simultaneously, a festival of cloying clichÃ©s. You sicken me.",5,Big Bang Theory,63,9
21921,Howard,5, You're really quiet. Is everything okay?,5,Big Bang Theory,41,6
21923,Howard,5," I hope not too tired, because I'm feeling particularly masculine right now. All systems go, if you catch my drift.",5,Big Bang Theory,115,20
21925,Howard,5," All right, well, something's obviously bugging you. What is it?",5,Big Bang Theory,64,10
21927,Howard,5," Oh, I get it. You're worried about me. That is so sweet. You know, there's a saying we have at NASA. What makes the right stuff so right is that it always comes home.",5,Big Bang Theory,167,34
21929,Howard,5, This isn't the reaction I expected when I told you I was gonna be an astronaut.,5,Big Bang Theory,80,16
21931,Howard,5, Honestly? Sex.,5,Big Bang Theory,15,2
21933,Howard,5, Do you realize what a big deal this is? What an honour it is to be chosen to go into space?,5,Big Bang Theory,92,21
21935,Howard,5," I'm sorry. You're right. Okay, let's try this again. Bernadette, an opportunity has come up that impacts both of us, and I'd like to discuss it.",5,Big Bang Theory,145,26
21937,Howard,5, I've been offered a chance to go up to the International Space Station for three weeks. What are your thoughts on that?,5,Big Bang Theory,120,22
21939,Howard,5," Hey, we're a team. So, what do you think?",5,Big Bang Theory,42,9
21941,Howard,5, No?,5,Big Bang Theory,4,1
21943,Howard,5, Well why not?,5,Big Bang Theory,14,3
21945,Howard,5," Hey, my father abandoned me and my mother when I was 11. We never saw him again.",5,Big Bang Theory,81,17
21948,Leonard,5," Pretty cool about Howard, huh?",5,Big Bang Theory,31,5
21949,Sheldon,5," Don't talk to me as if nothing's happened between us. And yes, it sure is, buddy.",5,Big Bang Theory,82,16
21950,Leonard,5," For God's sake, will you stop with the Schrodinger stuff.",5,Big Bang Theory,58,10
21951,Sheldon,5," Would you prefer a simpler application of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, in which I could either know where you are or whether I like you, but not both?",5,Big Bang Theory,158,27
21952,Leonard,5," You never stop talking, do you?",5,Big Bang Theory,32,6
21953,Amy,5, I don't understand. What differences does it make if Leonard goes to Wil Wheaton's party?,5,Big Bang Theory,90,15
21954,Penny,5, Wil Wheaton is Sheldon's mortal enemy.,5,Big Bang Theory,39,6
21955,Amy,5, Mortal enemy?,5,Big Bang Theory,14,2
21956,Penny,5, Mm-hmm.,5,Big Bang Theory,8,1
21957,Amy,5," Sheldon, I know you're a bit of a left-handed monkey wrench, but, you really have a mortal enemy?",5,Big Bang Theory,98,18
21958,Sheldon,5," In fact, I have 61 of them. Would you like to see the list?",5,Big Bang Theory,60,14
21959,Penny,5," Oh, say no, say no, say no, say no.",5,Big Bang Theory,36,9
21960,Sheldon,5, You just got off the list. Would you like back on it? This'll just take a moment. It's on a five and a quarter inch floppy.,5,Big Bang Theory,124,26
21961,Amy,5, A floppy disk?,5,Big Bang Theory,15,3
21962,Sheldon,5," Well, I started the list when I was nine.",5,Big Bang Theory,42,9
21963,Amy,5, How did Wil Wheaton get on the list?,5,Big Bang Theory,37,8
21965,Sheldon,5," As a child, I loved Wesley Crusher, Wil Wheaton's character on Star Trek. So, I drove for hours by bus to a Star Trek convention at which Wil Wheaton was scheduled to appear, so that I could get my Wesley Crusher action figure signed. But he never showed, because apparently, it was cooler for him to be the lower-left corner on Hollywood Squares. Oh, damn! The floppy failed. Well, whoever was in charge of quality control at the Verbatim Corporation in 1989, congratulations, you just made the list.",5,Big Bang Theory,502,88
21968,Howard,5," Change your mind about sex? I'm still mad, but I'll do it.",5,Big Bang Theory,59,12
21970,Howard,5, Really?,5,Big Bang Theory,8,1
21972,Howard,5, Thank you.,5,Big Bang Theory,11,2
21974,Howard,5," I love you, too. So, sex now?",5,Big Bang Theory,30,7
21979,Leonard,5," Wait, let me see if I got this right. You actually asked Bernadette to leave your house in the middle of the night?",5,Big Bang Theory,116,23
21980,Howard,5, What choice did I have? She went behind my back and turned my own mother against me.,5,Big Bang Theory,85,17
21981,Raj,5, Wow. You're not only our first astronaut. You're also the first one of us to kick a girl out of bed. You're like a rock star.,5,Big Bang Theory,126,26
21982,Howard,5, Little bit.,5,Big Bang Theory,12,2
21983,Leonard,5," I hate to say it, but she did kind of betray you.",5,Big Bang Theory,50,12
21984,Sheldon,5," Interesting. You see betrayal in others, but not yourself.",5,Big Bang Theory,59,9
21985,Leonard,5, Going to Wheaton's party is not betraying you.,5,Big Bang Theory,47,8
21986,Sheldon,5," Oh, of course you would have to believe that. Evil always thinks it's doing right. Excuse me, Stormtrooper. These are the droids you're looking for.",5,Big Bang Theory,149,25
21987,Leonard,5, I'm going to a party. I'm not turning R2-D2 and C-3PO over to the empire!,5,Big Bang Theory,74,15
21988,Sheldon,5, Not yet.,5,Big Bang Theory,9,2
21989,Raj,5," So, what's gonna happen next? Are you and Bernadette going to break up?",5,Big Bang Theory,72,13
21990,Howard,5," I don't know. If we're going to get back together, she's going to have to apologize and accept that I'm a grown man who can make his own decisions.",5,Big Bang Theory,148,29
21991,Raj,5, Then she's going to have to convince your mother to let you go into space.,5,Big Bang Theory,75,15
21992,Howard,5, Obviously.,5,Big Bang Theory,11,1
21995,Amy,5, You're kidding.,5,Big Bang Theory,16,2
21996,Penny,5," No, I was there that day. Sheldon threw his back out handing him that book.",5,Big Bang Theory,76,15
21998,Penny,5," Okay, why don't you just tell him you made a mistake?",5,Big Bang Theory,54,11
22000,Amy,5, It's not for us to judge. We're just here to provide comfort and support while you come to grips with what a despicable thing you've done.,5,Big Bang Theory,139,26
22002,Penny,5," Well, that, that's good. I'm glad you came to that. But before you do, let me just ask you a big picture question.",5,Big Bang Theory,115,23
22004,Penny,5, Are you a hundred percent positive you love and want to marry Howard Wolowitz?,5,Big Bang Theory,79,14
22006,Penny,5, Got it. Just had to check.,5,Big Bang Theory,27,6
22007,Amy,5, He's great.,5,Big Bang Theory,12,2
22009,Leonard,5," All right, Sheldon, we're going to Wil's. This is your last chance.",5,Big Bang Theory,68,12
22010,Sheldon,5," No, Leonard, this is your last chance. One day, a historian is going to come to you and say, is it true you were friends with Dr. Sheldon Cooper? And you're going to have to choke back a hot sob of regret and humiliation as you mumble, I was, but I chose to go to a party thrown by the one kid from Stand By Me that no one remembers.",5,Big Bang Theory,334,70
22011,Leonard,5, You want to drive?,5,Big Bang Theory,19,4
22012,Raj,5, Sure.,5,Big Bang Theory,6,1
22013,Leonard,5," Hey, Sheldon?",5,Big Bang Theory,14,2
22014,Sheldon,5," Oh, good. You picked me, you picked me.",5,Big Bang Theory,40,8
22015,Leonard,5," No, I just got a text from Stuart. Brent Spiner is at the party.",5,Big Bang Theory,65,14
22016,Sheldon,5, Brent Spiner?,5,Big Bang Theory,14,2
22017,Leonard,5, Yes.,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
22018,Sheldon,5, I don't care.,5,Big Bang Theory,14,3
22019,Leonard,5," Really? Brent Spiner, Mr. Data himself. You love him.",5,Big Bang Theory,54,9
22020,Sheldon,5," I did, but I think I've kind of outgrown Star Trek. You know, stock characters, ludicrous plots, beam me up. What a load of hooey.",5,Big Bang Theory,131,25
22021,Leonard,5," I'm going. Live long and prosper, Sheldon.",5,Big Bang Theory,43,7
22022,Sheldon,5," Yeah, even that. You look like a dork.",5,Big Bang Theory,39,8
22025,Howard,5, Tell her I'm not home!,5,Big Bang Theory,23,5
22028,Howard,5, You can. I have nothing to say.,5,Big Bang Theory,32,7
22030,Howard,5," I was gonna tell her eventually, but you went behind my back.",5,Big Bang Theory,62,12
22032,Howard,5," If you're gonna love me, you're gonna have to love the whole package, the tenderhearted poet and the crazy daredevil.",5,Big Bang Theory,118,20
22034,Howard,5," Well, don't say it if you're not gonna mean it, 'cause I'm not just gonna stop with the space station. Yeah, I want to go to the Moon, I want to go to Mars. I want to take a one-man sub to the lowest depths of the ocean.",5,Big Bang Theory,221,48
22036,Howard,5," Well, those big kids were rocking it.",5,Big Bang Theory,38,7
22038,Howard,5, Really?,5,Big Bang Theory,8,1
22040,Howard,5," Right, right.",5,Big Bang Theory,14,2
22043,Raj,5," Hey, you know that beautiful actress who plays the Borg Queen in First Contact?",5,Big Bang Theory,80,14
22044,Leonard,5, Yeah.,5,Big Bang Theory,6,1
22045,Raj,5," Well, I just met her gynaecologist!",5,Big Bang Theory,36,6
22046,Leonard,5, What are you doing here?,5,Big Bang Theory,25,5
22047,Sheldon,5," Fighting for our friendship. As peculiar and annoying as you can be, you're still my little buddy. I'm not going to let that end here tonight. Now put down that drink, let's meet Brent Spiner and go home.",5,Big Bang Theory,205,38
22049,Sheldon,5, What I'd like is for him to have a more depressing home. This is quite lovely.,5,Big Bang Theory,79,16
22051,Sheldon,5, An original mint-in-package Wesley Crusher action figure.,5,Big Bang Theory,58,7
22054,Sheldon,5," To Sheldon, sorry this took so long. Your friend, Wil Wheaton.",5,Big Bang Theory,63,11
22056,Sheldon,5," Look, everyone. Wil Wheaton is my friend!",5,Big Bang Theory,42,7
22058,Sheldon,5," Brent Spiner, what have you done? That was an original mint-in-package Wesley Crusher action figure signed by my close personal friend, Wil Wheaton.",5,Big Bang Theory,149,23
22060,Sheldon,5," You've already signed something, Brent Spiner. Your name on my list. From this moment on, you are my mortal enemy.",5,Big Bang Theory,115,20
22062,Sheldon,5," Come on, buddy. Let's not waste another second on this loser. Love your house.",5,Big Bang Theory,79,14
22063,Leonard,5, Can we get autographed dolls?,5,Big Bang Theory,30,5
22065,Leonard,5, Ten.,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
22067,Leonard,5, Twelve.,5,Big Bang Theory,8,1
22069,Leonard,5, Two for thirty. And you come to my birthday party.,5,Big Bang Theory,51,10
22072,Leonard,6, So what kind of cruise is this you're going on?,5,Big Bang Theory,48,10
22074,Sheldon,6," Well, Mom, if I did, it would be conclusive proof that your God can work miracles.",5,Big Bang Theory,83,16
22076,Leonard,6, What's Gunning with God? I'm afraid to ask.,5,Big Bang Theory,44,8
22078,Sheldon,6," Frankly, Mom, I'm encouraged to see how advanced your group has become, willing to sail out into the ocean without fear of falling off the edge.",5,Big Bang Theory,145,26
22080,Sheldon,6," The Lord giveth and the Lord bloweth away. Well, Mom, according to my itinerary for our weekend together, the fun begins with fried chicken.",5,Big Bang Theory,141,24
22082,Sheldon,6," Good, 'cause I got you everything you need to make it. You are in for a treat. My mother's fried chicken is why we had to buy my dad the extra large coffin.",5,Big Bang Theory,157,33
22083,Leonard,6," Sheldon, she just got off the plane. She doesn't want to cook.",5,Big Bang Theory,63,12
22084,Sheldon,6, Of course she does. Making me food is her way of saying I love you. Making me food when she's too tired to cook is her way of saying I really love you.,5,Big Bang Theory,152,33
22086,Sheldon,6, Won't that spoil our appetites for the chicken you're going to make me?,5,Big Bang Theory,72,13
22087,Leonard,6," All right, that settles it, we're going out. Do you like sushi? There's a great little place down the street.",5,Big Bang Theory,110,20
22089,Sheldon,6, There's a lot of harm in trying something new. That's why we test out drugs and cosmetics on bunny rabbits.,5,Big Bang Theory,108,20
22090,Leonard,6," Sheldon, you're talking like a crazy person.",5,Big Bang Theory,45,7
22092,Sheldon,6, Told you.,5,Big Bang Theory,10,2
22096,Sheldon,6, Stop yelling! I'm not happy about this.,5,Big Bang Theory,40,7
22097,Leonard,6, What's the last thing you were ever happy about?,5,Big Bang Theory,49,9
22098,Sheldon,6, The prospect of fried chicken.,5,Big Bang Theory,31,5
22100,Leonard,6," Uh, kung fu letters might not be politically correct.",5,Big Bang Theory,54,9
22102,Leonard,6," Yeah, yeah, that, too.",5,Big Bang Theory,23,4
22104,Sheldon,6," Well, there's actually big news on the Amy front. She's been studying the neurobiology of addiction in lower animals. She is this close to getting a starfish hooked on cocaine.",5,Big Bang Theory,177,30
22106,Leonard,6," It's kind of like the Loch Ness monster. Maybe there's something there, maybe there isn't. We'll probably never know. But sometimes it's fun to creep yourself out thinking about it.",5,Big Bang Theory,182,30
22108,Leonard,6," Uh, yeah, it's Raj's sister. It's kind of tough. She's in India. Also, her parents aren't happy she's dating someone white.",5,Big Bang Theory,124,21
22110,Sheldon,6," And that reminds me of another saying. You can lead a chicken to Crisco, but you can'tmake your mother fry it.",5,Big Bang Theory,111,21
22112,Leonard,6," Please pester her. Please, for me.",5,Big Bang Theory,35,6
22114,Leonard,6," So, Mrs. Cooper, what did you think of the sushi?",5,Big Bang Theory,50,10
22116,Sheldon,6, I don't know. Lately we've been talking about converting it into a missile silo.,5,Big Bang Theory,81,14
22117,Leonard,6, Your son seems to think we need to launch a pre-emptive strike on Burbank.,5,Big Bang Theory,75,14
22118,Sheldon,6, Get them before they get us.,5,Big Bang Theory,29,6
22119,Raj,6," Hey, look who decided to show up.",5,Big Bang Theory,34,7
22120,Leonard,6," Raj, what are you doing?",5,Big Bang Theory,25,5
22121,Raj,6," I couldn't find you guys so I bought six new friends. Three, sadly, are dead.",5,Big Bang Theory,78,15
22122,Sheldon,6," Mom, you remember Rajesh? Rajesh, my mother.",5,Big Bang Theory,45,7
22123,Raj,6, Of course. Mrs. Cooper. So nice to see you again.,5,Big Bang Theory,50,10
22125,Leonard,6," We don't say that, either. I'll make you a list.",5,Big Bang Theory,49,10
22127,Raj,6," Nothing, I'm fine.",5,Big Bang Theory,19,3
22129,Raj,6, No. ,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
22131,Raj,6, I'm so lonely.,5,Big Bang Theory,15,3
22132,Sheldon,6," Oh, yes, born alone, die alone. It's a tragic human condition. Now, Raj, if you'll excuse my mother, she's about to make a pecan pie that'll be so good I'll almost forget how she blew it with the fried chicken.",5,Big Bang Theory,211,40
22134,Sheldon,6, Offer them a hot beverage.,5,Big Bang Theory,27,5
22136,Sheldon,6, Coffee.,5,Big Bang Theory,8,1
22138,Raj,6," I didn't get a lot of that because of your accent, but the general tone was soothing and somehow I feel better.",5,Big Bang Theory,112,22
22139,Sheldon,6," I'm not going to get my pecan pie, am I?",5,Big Bang Theory,41,10
22140,Leonard,6, You want some Oreos?,5,Big Bang Theory,21,4
22141,Sheldon,6, Double Stuf?,5,Big Bang Theory,13,2
22142,Leonard,6," No, regular.",5,Big Bang Theory,13,2
22143,Sheldon,6, Nice. Kick a man when he's down.,5,Big Bang Theory,33,7
22145,Sheldon,6," I'm glad we're finally getting to do something together, just the two of us.",5,Big Bang Theory,77,14
22147,Sheldon,6," Careful, you're using too much Downey. You know if my clothes get too soft it makes me sleepy.",5,Big Bang Theory,95,18
22149,Sheldon,6," It is nice, isn't it?",5,Big Bang Theory,22,5
22150,Penny,6, Mrs. Cooper. Hi!,5,Big Bang Theory,17,3
22152,Penny,6," Sheldon, you didn't tell me your mom was coming.",5,Big Bang Theory,49,9
22153,Sheldon,6," It was in my weekly e-mail blast. Right between beet season is finally here, and uh-oh, red stool from beets leads to cancer scare.",5,Big Bang Theory,132,24
22155,Penny,6," Good, good.",5,Big Bang Theory,12,2
22157,Penny,6," Oh, fine. You know, it's been a while. I'm getting back out there.",5,Big Bang Theory,67,13
22159,Penny,6," Well, it's super cute on. That top has paid for itself in free drinks like ten times what it cost.",5,Big Bang Theory,99,20
22160,Sheldon,6," Yes, Penny has a lot of her money tied up in promiscuity futures.",5,Big Bang Theory,66,13
22162,Penny,6," Oh, they don't always get to ride the roller coaster. Sometimes they only get to spin the teacups. Now I'm going out tonight. Would it be crazy to ask you to look at the outfit I'm going to wear?",5,Big Bang Theory,196,39
22164,Sheldon,6, Now that will not be in this week's e-mail blast.,5,Big Bang Theory,50,10
22166,Howard,6," So, this spring, I get to go to the International Space Station.",5,Big Bang Theory,65,12
22168,Howard,6," Thanks, but I watch the Charlie Brown Christmas special every year, so I get the gist.",5,Big Bang Theory,87,16
22170,Howard,6," Nope. She says if I don't back out she's going to go on a hunger strike. It would take years before she'd be in any kind of danger, but still.",5,Big Bang Theory,143,30
22171,Sheldon,6," I've got a treat for us tomorrow, Mom. I'm taking you to see Saul Perlmutter give a lecture about his Nobel Prize-winning work in cosmology. And the best part is, at the Q and A afterward, I've worked up a couple of Q's that will stump his sorry A.",5,Big Bang Theory,249,49
22173,Sheldon,6, What sight is better than your little boy embarrassing a Nobel laureate?,5,Big Bang Theory,73,12
22175,Penny,6," Ooh, maybe a little Rodeo Drive.",5,Big Bang Theory,33,6
22177,Howard,6, What do you say?,5,Big Bang Theory,17,4
22178,Sheldon,6," What do I say? I say you people need to stop ruining my mom's visit with your sushi, and your sadness and your slutty shirts. Stop it.",5,Big Bang Theory,135,27
22179,Howard,6, He's not talking about your shirt. Your shirt is fine.,5,Big Bang Theory,55,10
22181,Leonard,6, These are delicious.,5,Big Bang Theory,21,3
22183,Leonard,6, Everything? Aren't you worried about your health?,5,Big Bang Theory,50,7
22185,Sheldon,6," Mom, I want to apologize for my behaviour last night.",5,Big Bang Theory,54,10
22187,Sheldon,6," Great. Now, you're going to love the Perlmutter lecture. Look, he will be stating that the universe is older than 6,000 years, but I thought you could stick your fingers in your ears and hum Amazing Grace during those parts.",5,Big Bang Theory,225,40
22189,Sheldon,6, But I apologized. And that was hard for me because I didn't do anything wrong.,5,Big Bang Theory,79,15
22191,Sheldon,6," I'm not going, and you can't make me.",5,Big Bang Theory,38,8
22193,Sheldon,6," Well, I'm going to stand here until you change your mind.",5,Big Bang Theory,58,11
22195,Leonard,6, I'm just gonna take my bacon grease and slide over there.,5,Big Bang Theory,58,11
22196,Sheldon,6, I can't believe my own mother is abandoning me.,5,Big Bang Theory,48,9
22198,Sheldon,6," We appear to be at a crossroads in our relationship, Mother.",5,Big Bang Theory,61,11
22200,Leonard,6, Sorry. Syrup.,5,Big Bang Theory,14,2
22201,Sheldon,6," All right, Mom. When you're at the Ripley's Believe It Or Not Museum, if they have an exhibit about a mother who threw away a chance to spend the day with the world's most wonderful son, believe it, because it's true. ",5,Big Bang Theory,219,41
22202,Leonard,6, I hadn't,5,Big Bang Theory,9,2
22204,Sheldon,6, That lecture was a waste of time. I made more accurate diagrams of the expansion of the early universe on the nursery wall with the contents of my diaper. ,5,Big Bang Theory,156,29
22205,Amy,6, Are you getting sick?,5,Big Bang Theory,22,4
22206,Sheldon,6," No, I'm just allergic to people who get Nobel Prizes for no good reason.",5,Big Bang Theory,73,14
22207,Amy,6," Sheldon, is it possible that your foul mood, or, to use the clinical term, bitchiness, is because your mother isn't making you a priority?",5,Big Bang Theory,139,24
22208,Sheldon,6," No. Or to use the clinical term, nuh-uh.",5,Big Bang Theory,41,8
22209,Amy,6, Are you sure? The infant-mother pair-bond is the building block of primate psychology.,5,Big Bang Theory,87,13
22210,Sheldon,6," Oh, there it is. It always comes back to monkeys with you. Just monkeys, monkeys, monkeys.",5,Big Bang Theory,91,16
22211,Amy,6," Sheldon, we're all animals. And granted, there are aspects of you that are extraordinary, but when it comes to emotions and relationships, you're just like everybody else.",5,Big Bang Theory,172,27
22212,Sheldon,6, Are you trying to suggest that my emotional problems are no different than those of a stupid person?,5,Big Bang Theory,101,18
22213,Amy,6," Actually, some research indicates that by not over-thinking, the less intelligent handle emotions better.  Sure you're not coming down with a cold?",5,Big Bang Theory,148,22
22214,Sheldon,6," Oh, yes, the common cold. Just like everyone else. You'd love that, wouldn't you?",5,Big Bang Theory,82,14
22217,Leonard,6," Mrs. Cooper, we say Catholics, not rosary rattlers.",5,Big Bang Theory,52,8
22219,Penny,6, This is like the worst Hollywood tour ever.,5,Big Bang Theory,44,8
22220,Leonard,6, What are you gonna do? She wanted to see churches.,5,Big Bang Theory,51,10
22221,Penny,6," Hey, they have wine here, don't they?",5,Big Bang Theory,38,7
22222,Raj,6," Hey, none of our gods have abs like that.",5,Big Bang Theory,42,9
22223,Howard,6," Yep, that's the last Jew who did sit-ups. And look where it got him.",5,Big Bang Theory,69,14
22225,Leonard,6," Oh, I'm not sure we should.",5,Big Bang Theory,28,6
22227,Penny,6," Okay, um, hey, God. What's up? Um, I'm good, but, uh, it would be a big help to my family if you could get my brother to stop cooking meth. But no cops. Be cool.",5,Big Bang Theory,162,35
22229,Leonard,6," Okay. I don't know, it's probably a little late to ask you to make me taller. Oh, um, if you could help out with me and my girlfriend. She's all the way in India. That would be great.",5,Big Bang Theory,184,38
22231,Howard,6," Oh, me? No. Thanks, I'm good. I'm really just trying not to burst into flames.",5,Big Bang Theory,79,15
22233,Howard,6, He says he's having trouble dropping those last five pounds.,5,Big Bang Theory,61,10
22235,Howard,6," No, you only get one wish.",5,Big Bang Theory,27,6
22237,Sheldon,6," Look at the two of us. Me, a highly regarded physicist. The kind of mind that comes along once, maybe twice in a generation. You, the common man, tired from your labours as a stockbroker, or vacuum cleaner salesman, or bootblack. But deep down inside, apparently we're just two peas in a pod. A regular pea, and the kind of pea that comes along once, maybe twice in a generation. Rain. Another great equalizer. Falling on the head of the brilliant and the unremarkable alike.  Smarty-pants.",5,Big Bang Theory,491,86
22239,Penny,6," Oh, Mrs. Cooper, it smells so good.",5,Big Bang Theory,36,7
22241,Sheldon,6, I need a tissue.This one got wet.,5,Big Bang Theory,34,7
22242,Leonard,6, Here.,5,Big Bang Theory,6,1
22243,Sheldon,6," Thank you. Yeah, I've learned something today. You and I, in so many ways, other than intelligence and what counts, we're the same. ",5,Big Bang Theory,133,23
22245,Sheldon,6," I hope so, because if this is well, life isn't worth living.",5,Big Bang Theory,61,12
22247,Sheldon,6, Okay.,5,Big Bang Theory,6,1
22249,Sheldon,6," And just to be clear, only her baby and not these other people.",5,Big Bang Theory,64,13
22251,Sheldon,6, Can I have tea with honey and toast with the crust cut off?,5,Big Bang Theory,60,13
22253,Sheldon,6," Thanks, Mom.You're the best.",5,Big Bang Theory,29,4
22256,Sheldon,6," I know, it filled in last year. I didn't get to spend a lot of time with you on this visit.",5,Big Bang Theory,92,21
22258,Sheldon,6, Yours.,5,Big Bang Theory,7,1
22260,Sheldon,6," No, we don't. The one we have works great.",5,Big Bang Theory,43,9
22262,Sheldon,6," Or maybe I'm part of a new species, that lives for hundreds of years, which means I'm still basically a toddler.",5,Big Bang Theory,113,21
22264,Sheldon,6, Does this mean you're not going to sing Soft Kitty?,5,Big Bang Theory,52,10
22266,Leonard,6," Mrs. Cooper, were we supposed to take that pie out of the oven?",5,Big Bang Theory,64,13
22267,Sheldon,6, Get out!,5,Big Bang Theory,9,2
22269,Sheldon,6," Well, I know, but he means well. Sing.",5,Big Bang Theory,39,8
22271,Sheldon,6," What are you trying to pull, Mom? From the top.",5,Big Bang Theory,48,10
22274,Sheldon,7," And reverse the spin on the antiproton, and gamma becomes alpha, multiplied by a matrix of negative I comma zero, and there we have it. Conclusive proof that I am absolutely worthless after nine o'clock.",5,Big Bang Theory,204,35
22276,Sheldon,7," Hmm.  All right, all right. I see what's going on. A little pre-Halloween hijinkery. A ghostly moan, a rattling of chains, a witch's cackle. The trifecta of haunted house clichÃ©s. Instead of eek, I say yawn.",5,Big Bang Theory,209,36
22278,Sheldon,7," Oh, the walls are dripping blood, which looks nothing like a phenolphthalein indicator exposed to a sodium carbonate solution.  See you in hell Sheldon. The most frightening thing about that is the missing comma.  Ah. Okay, all right. That one was clever. Skeleton with phosphorous on a zip line. Come on out, merry pranksters. Take a bow.",5,Big Bang Theory,340,57
22279,Raj,7, You should've seen your face.,5,Big Bang Theory,30,5
22280,Sheldon,7," Yes, there's nothing quite like the slightly widened eyes of mildly startled.",5,Big Bang Theory,78,12
22281,Howard,7," Come on, admit it. We got you, Sheldon.",5,Big Bang Theory,40,8
22282,Sheldon,7," Please, fright depends on an element of surprise. The simple fact is, because I am much smarter than you, and able to anticipate your actions, it is highly unlikely that you two rubes could ever surprise me. ",5,Big Bang Theory,209,37
22283,Raj,7, He's probably right.,5,Big Bang Theory,21,3
22284,Howard,7, We can't beat him. He's just too smart.,5,Big Bang Theory,40,8
22285,Sheldon,7, Gentlemen. .,5,Big Bang Theory,13,2
22286,Howard,7, Who had money on faints?,5,Big Bang Theory,25,5
22287,Raj,7, I had pee his pants.,5,Big Bang Theory,21,5
22288,Leonard,7, Hang on. Looks like everyone's a winner.,5,Big Bang Theory,41,7
22290,Leonard,7," Oh. Watch out, Sheldon. This little boy Casper is a g-g-g-ghost!",5,Big Bang Theory,65,11
22291,Sheldon,7, Droll.,5,Big Bang Theory,7,1
22292,Howard,7,Not as droll as a grown man passed out in a puddle of his own urine.,5,Big Bang Theory,68,16
22293,Leonard,7, That was pretty droll. With a hint of ammonia.,5,Big Bang Theory,47,9
22294,Sheldon,7," Yes, enjoy your japes, gentlemen. You think you've poked fun at a milquetoast academic. Well, you've forgotten one thing. I am also a son of the Lone Star state. I'm Texas through and through. And we know how to settle scores down there. If you doubt me, ask Mexico.",5,Big Bang Theory,267,49
22296,Raj,7, What is she doing in a comic book store?,5,Big Bang Theory,41,9
22301,Leonard,7," Uh, yeah. It's issue number 21. First appearance of Hellboy.",5,Big Bang Theory,61,10
22303,Leonard,7, Sorry.,5,Big Bang Theory,7,1
22305,Leonard,7," Yes, but you'd be using your superpowers for evil.",5,Big Bang Theory,51,9
22307,Leonard,7, Leonard.,5,Big Bang Theory,9,1
22309,Leonard,7," Thanks. You, too. You know, go ahead and take it.",5,Big Bang Theory,50,10
22311,Leonard,7," Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, I guess.",5,Big Bang Theory,31,6
22313,Leonard,7," Sorry, palm's a little sweaty. What's that word?",5,Big Bang Theory,49,8
22315,Leonard,7," Oh, right, your name. That makes more sense than penis.",5,Big Bang Theory,56,10
22317,Howard,7, Did we just see you pick up a girl in a comic book store?,5,Big Bang Theory,58,14
22319,Leonard,7," No, I don't think I picked her up. Besides, I have a girlfriend.",5,Big Bang Theory,65,13
22322,Sheldon,7, Be sure to check the mail.,5,Big Bang Theory,27,6
22323,Leonard,7, How many times are you gonna tell me? What's with you?,5,Big Bang Theory,55,11
22324,Sheldon,7, Nothing. It's not suspicious that I'm fixating. It's consistent with my personality.,5,Big Bang Theory,85,12
22325,Leonard,7, Right.,5,Big Bang Theory,7,1
22326,Penny,7," Hey, guys.",5,Big Bang Theory,11,2
22327,Leonard,7, More Halloween candy? Didn't you just buy a bunch of it yesterday?,5,Big Bang Theory,67,12
22328,Penny,7, Oh. Yeah. That's gone. It's a rough month when Halloween and PMS hit at the same time.,5,Big Bang Theory,87,17
22329,Sheldon,7," Leonard doesn't have time to chat, he has to get the mail.",5,Big Bang Theory,59,12
22330,Leonard,7," Will you relax? I'll get it in a minute. Hey, how was work?",5,Big Bang Theory,60,13
22331,Sheldon,7, Open the mail!,5,Big Bang Theory,15,3
22332,Leonard,7," Excuse me.  A couple of circulars, nothing important.",5,Big Bang Theory,54,8
22333,Penny,7, What's with him?,5,Big Bang Theory,17,3
22334,Leonard,7," Hang on.  You might be from Texas, but I'm from New Jersey.",5,Big Bang Theory,60,12
22336,Leonard,7, Check it out. Jim Lee drew this of me two years ago at Comic Con.,5,Big Bang Theory,66,15
22338,Leonard,7," Well, you know, it's Comic Con. I'm Lion-O from ThunderCats.",5,Big Bang Theory,61,10
22340,Leonard,7, No. But Jessica Alba did rub my furry belly.,5,Big Bang Theory,45,9
22342,Leonard,7, You're kidding. You have your own book?,5,Big Bang Theory,40,7
22344,Leonard,7," Cool. Oh, look. That's you having sex with a guy in the top half of a Chewbacca costume. Comic Con?",5,Big Bang Theory,100,20
22346,Leonard,7, You're very talented. This is really good. Did you do ,5,Big Bang Theory,55,10
22348,Leonard,7, You can have my car.,5,Big Bang Theory,21,5
22350,Sheldon,7," Oh, dear.  Oh, dear.  Oh, dear, oh, dear. Oh, dear, oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Purell, Purell, Purell, Purell.",5,Big Bang Theory,114,20
22351,Raj,7," Good morning, Sheldon.",5,Big Bang Theory,23,3
22352,Sheldon,7," It is, isn't it? Oh, bother. Isn't that just always the way? You go to staple something, and you're out of staples. Gosh, I wish I'd known that earlier today when I was at Staples.",5,Big Bang Theory,181,35
22353,Raj,7, You have a thing of paper clips right there.,5,Big Bang Theory,45,9
22354,Sheldon,7," well, no, no, I need something more permanent to join these papers. Say, don't you keep staples in your top desk drawer?",5,Big Bang Theory,121,22
22355,Raj,7, I don't know. Maybe.,5,Big Bang Theory,21,4
22356,Sheldon,7, Be a lamb and check.,5,Big Bang Theory,21,5
22357,Raj,7, All right.  Who do we have here?,5,Big Bang Theory,33,7
22358,Sheldon,7, It's a snake. A terrifying snake.,5,Big Bang Theory,34,6
22359,Raj,7," Oh, did some bad man put us in a drawer?",5,Big Bang Theory,41,10
22360,Sheldon,7, Stop talking like that. You've been rendered speechless by fear.,5,Big Bang Theory,65,10
22361,Raj,7, Let's go to the biology lab and find you some nice yummy mice.,5,Big Bang Theory,63,13
22362,Sheldon,7," I tried to scare an Indian with a snake. Come on, Cooper. You're better than this.",5,Big Bang Theory,83,16
22364,Penny,7, It's open.,5,Big Bang Theory,11,2
22365,Leonard,7," Hey, you got a minute?",5,Big Bang Theory,23,5
22366,Penny,7," Yeah, sure, come on in.",5,Big Bang Theory,24,5
22367,Leonard,7, Thanks.,5,Big Bang Theory,8,1
22368,Penny,7, Want some mac and cheese?,5,Big Bang Theory,26,5
22369,Leonard,7, No. Lactose. Gas.,5,Big Bang Theory,18,3
22370,Penny,7, Glass of wine?,5,Big Bang Theory,15,3
22371,Leonard,7, No. Sulfites. Migraines.,5,Big Bang Theory,25,3
22372,Penny,7," Okay, well, I'd offer you Halloween candy, but that's gone. So, what's up?",5,Big Bang Theory,75,13
22373,Leonard,7," Okay, we used to go out, right?",5,Big Bang Theory,32,7
22374,Penny,7," Oh, my God, that's where I know you from.",5,Big Bang Theory,42,9
22375,Leonard,7," I'm dealing with a situation and it's kind of about my love life, so I know that might be weird for us to talk about, but in this area, as you know, all my other friends are just so stupid.",5,Big Bang Theory,190,40
22376,Penny,7," All right, what's going on?",5,Big Bang Theory,28,5
22377,Leonard,7," So, you're okay talking about this?",5,Big Bang Theory,36,6
22378,Penny,7, Yes.,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
22379,Leonard,7, You're sure it's not weird.,5,Big Bang Theory,28,5
22380,Penny,7, It's okay.,5,Big Bang Theory,11,2
22381,Leonard,7," You know what, if you ever want to talk to me about a problem in your life with a guy, then I would be fine with that.",5,Big Bang Theory,119,27
22382,Penny,7," Okay, good, because there's this one guy I used to date who's about to be force-fed wine and cheese if he doesn't get to the point.",5,Big Bang Theory,132,26
22383,Leonard,7," Okay, uh, here it is. Is it cheating if a guy has a girlfriend",5,Big Bang Theory,63,14
22384,Penny,7," Yeah, probably.",5,Big Bang Theory,16,2
22385,Leonard,7, Come on.,5,Big Bang Theory,9,2
22386,Penny,7," I'm sorry, go ahead.",5,Big Bang Theory,21,4
22387,Leonard,7," I met this girl, and she's great. We have a lot in common.",5,Big Bang Theory,59,13
22388,Penny,7, Did you guys do it?,5,Big Bang Theory,20,5
22389,Leonard,7, No. We just made out a little.,5,Big Bang Theory,31,7
22390,Penny,7," Oh, look at you, you bad boy. Did you tell her about Priya?",5,Big Bang Theory,60,13
22391,Leonard,7," Well, I was gonna, but there were too many tongues in my mouth.",5,Big Bang Theory,64,13
22392,Penny,7, That's gross.,5,Big Bang Theory,14,2
22393,Leonard,7," Here's the thing, I, I'm not one of those guys who sneaks around and sleeps with more than one woman.",5,Big Bang Theory,102,20
22394,Penny,7," Well, good for you.",5,Big Bang Theory,20,4
22395,Leonard,7," The problem is, I want to be one of those guys.",5,Big Bang Theory,48,11
22396,Penny,7, So sleep with the new girl and lie to Priya.,5,Big Bang Theory,45,10
22397,Leonard,7," Oh, that's not who I am.",5,Big Bang Theory,25,6
22398,Penny,7," All right, then break it off with the new girl.",5,Big Bang Theory,48,10
22399,Leonard,7," Now, let's not do anything rash. She's really hot.",5,Big Bang Theory,51,9
22400,Penny,7," If you like this girl so much, why don't you just end things with Priya?",5,Big Bang Theory,73,15
22401,Leonard,7, Priya and I are in love. I think we could get married someday.,5,Big Bang Theory,63,13
22402,Penny,7," Leonard, you're looking for a way to sleep with both women and have everybody be happy about it.",5,Big Bang Theory,97,18
22403,Leonard,7, Now we're getting somewhere.,5,Big Bang Theory,29,4
22404,Penny,7, What does your gut tell you?,5,Big Bang Theory,29,6
22405,Leonard,7, Go ask Penny; she'll know what to do.,5,Big Bang Theory,38,8
22407,Sheldon,7," Hello, Howard. I've realized that you scaring me was all in jest. Allow me to say, job well done.  Perfect.",5,Big Bang Theory,108,20
22408,Leonard,7, What are you doing?,5,Big Bang Theory,20,4
22409,Sheldon,7, Science. You wouldn't understand.,5,Big Bang Theory,34,4
22410,Leonard,7," Hey, well, see you. I'm going out. ",5,Big Bang Theory,36,7
22411,Sheldon,7, I thought you were leaving the apartment.,5,Big Bang Theory,42,7
22412,Leonard,7," Yeah, me, too. I can't make up my mind.",5,Big Bang Theory,40,9
22413,Sheldon,7, Are you concerned because the world is filled with big dogs and bullies?,5,Big Bang Theory,73,13
22414,Leonard,7, No. I'm having a moral crisis.,5,Big Bang Theory,31,6
22415,Sheldon,7," Well, if it's of any help, I've read all the great moral philosophers, including Dr. Seuss.",5,Big Bang Theory,92,16
22416,Leonard,7," Oh, what the hell. I'm supposed to go see that girl from the comic book store, Alice, but I don't know if I should, because I'm going out with Priya, but she's in India.",5,Big Bang Theory,170,34
22417,Sheldon,7," All right. So the topic at hand is sexual fidelity. Probably won't be relying on Seuss here. Although One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish might be surprisingly applicable. Go on.",5,Big Bang Theory,183,32
22418,Leonard,7," Well, they say at the end of your life, you regret the stuff you didn't do more than the stuff that you did, and I'm pretty sure Alice is the stuff I want to do.",5,Big Bang Theory,162,35
22419,Sheldon,7," You know, the German philosopher, Friedrich Nietzsche, believed that morality is just a fiction used by the herd of inferior human beings to hold back the few superior men.",5,Big Bang Theory,173,29
22420,Leonard,7, That actually does help.,5,Big Bang Theory,25,4
22421,Sheldon,7, It's worth noting that he died of syphilis.,5,Big Bang Theory,44,8
22422,Leonard,7," Screw it, I'm going.",5,Big Bang Theory,21,4
22423,Sheldon,7," On your way home, will you pick up some orange juice?",5,Big Bang Theory,54,11
22424,Leonard,7, Do you mind? I'm questioning a lot of things in my life right now.,5,Big Bang Theory,67,14
22425,Sheldon,7, Is one of those things your fondness for orange juice?,5,Big Bang Theory,55,10
22426,Leonard,7, No.,5,Big Bang Theory,4,1
22427,Sheldon,7," Great. Tropicana, no pulp.",5,Big Bang Theory,27,4
22429,Howard,7," Hey, Sheldon.",5,Big Bang Theory,14,2
22431,Sheldon,7," It's me, Sheldon, Mrs. Wolowitz.",5,Big Bang Theory,33,5
22432,Howard,7," That's not my mom, it's Bernadette.",5,Big Bang Theory,36,6
22433,Sheldon,7, Really? That's very unsettling.,5,Big Bang Theory,32,4
22435,Sheldon,7, Hi.,5,Big Bang Theory,4,1
22436,Howard,7, What's up?,5,Big Bang Theory,11,2
22437,Sheldon,7," It just occurred to me that I never formally congratulated you on your pending nuptials. So I hopped on the first bus and hightailed it down here to shake your hand. Put â€˜er there, you old so-and-so.",5,Big Bang Theory,202,37
22438,Howard,7," Well, I, I'm gonna see you at work in 12 hours, don't you think it could have waited until then?",5,Big Bang Theory,97,20
22439,Sheldon,7," Holy smoke, why didn't I think of that? You're a better man than I, Howard Wolowitz. You put â€˜er there, you son of a gun!",5,Big Bang Theory,124,25
22440,Howard,7, Whatever.  My oh it's ,5,Big Bang Theory,23,4
22442,Sheldon,7, It was a harmless Halloween prank. Look.,5,Big Bang Theory,41,7
22444,Sheldon,7," Well, I thought he made that up. Isn't hypochondria a common idiosyncrasy of Jewish people?",5,Big Bang Theory,92,15
22446,Sheldon,7, We are?,5,Big Bang Theory,8,2
22448,Sheldon,7," Oh, no! I can't!",5,Big Bang Theory,17,4
22450,Sheldon,7, Okay.,5,Big Bang Theory,6,1
22452,Sheldon,7," Oh, God! One, two, three!",5,Big Bang Theory,26,5
22453,Howard,7," Trick or treat, bubbeleh.",5,Big Bang Theory,26,4
22454,Sheldon,7," What? No. You mean this was all a ruse? Oh, how could I be so stu .",5,Big Bang Theory,68,17
22456,Leonard,7," Damn it, I can't. I can't, I can't do this.",5,Big Bang Theory,44,10
22458,Leonard,7," No, no, no. I, I can't do this. Believe me, I really want to.",5,Big Bang Theory,62,14
22460,Leonard,7, But I kind of have a girlfriend.,5,Big Bang Theory,33,7
22462,Leonard,7," You're cool with you and me just being friends, right?",5,Big Bang Theory,55,10
22464,Leonard,7," Wait, I don't, which part?",5,Big Bang Theory,27,5
22466,Leonard,7," Oh, no, no, you have it wrong. No. I, I was going to be a jackass, but I stopped myself. I stayed a good guy, so, I'm gonna pass on the sex. But you should know, that's not a comment on your hotness but on my goodness. That's kind of my superpower. I'm, like, Captain Good Guy.",5,Big Bang Theory,278,57
22468,Leonard,7, It's okay. Did the right thing. You idiot!,5,Big Bang Theory,43,8
22470,Leonard,7," Hey, Priya.",5,Big Bang Theory,12,2
22472,Leonard,7," Uh, not so good. We have to talk.",5,Big Bang Theory,34,8
22474,Leonard,7," Okay, uh, here it is. I met this girl and I kissed her, and I feel terrible about it. But it's done, it's never gonna happen again. And I am so, so sorry.",5,Big Bang Theory,155,33
22476,Leonard,7, It is?,5,Big Bang Theory,7,2
22478,Leonard,7," Oh, my God, you are amazing. I mean, I don't deserve you. Wh, what do, what do you mean everybody?",5,Big Bang Theory,99,20
22480,Leonard,7," Uh, kind of?",5,Big Bang Theory,13,3
22482,Leonard,7," No, no, I messed up a little. You messed up a lot.",5,Big Bang Theory,51,12
22484,Leonard,7," Oh yeah, it is, and you won. I, I, I'm, I'm sorry, I have to go. I don't believe this.",5,Big Bang Theory,87,20
22485,Sheldon,7," Bazinga, punk. Now we're even.",5,Big Bang Theory,31,5
22487,Penny,8," So, Bernadette, how goes the hunt for bridesmaid dresses?",5,Big Bang Theory,58,9
22489,Amy,8," Girlfriends, I have the answer to our dress problems.",5,Big Bang Theory,54,9
22491,Amy,8," Twelve years ago, my cousin Irene and her entire family died in a horrific carbon monoxide accident the night before her wedding.",5,Big Bang Theory,130,22
22493,Amy,8," Yes and no. All those bridesmaids dresses remain unused and available to us for free. So it seems that cloud of odourless deadly gas had a silver lining after all. Check it out, still in the bags. The gowns, not the bridesmaids.",5,Big Bang Theory,229,42
22495,Penny,8," Yeah, and cap sleeves? U-u-uh.",5,Big Bang Theory,31,5
22496,Amy,8," Uh, I was hoping you wouldn't notice. Irene was always a slave to a good bargain when it came to clothes, and sadly as it turned out, space heaters.",5,Big Bang Theory,149,29
22497,Sheldon,8," Ladies, please. These four walls once housed an intellectual salon where the mind received nourishment as well as the stomach. But through no one's fault, Penny, the quality of dinner conversation in this apartment has declined. And again, I'm looking at no one in particular, Penny.",5,Big Bang Theory,284,46
22498,Leonard,8," Fine. What would you like to talk about, Sheldon?",5,Big Bang Theory,50,9
22499,Howard,8," What would you like to talk about, Sheldon? Why do you hate us?",5,Big Bang Theory,64,13
22500,Sheldon,8, I've prepared a number of topics that should appeal to both the advanced and novice conversationalists.,5,Big Bang Theory,104,16
22501,Penny,8," Okay, that time you looked at me.",5,Big Bang Theory,34,7
22502,Amy,8, Who didn't? Your skin is like alabaster. Do you even have pores?,5,Big Bang Theory,65,12
22503,Sheldon,8," Topic one. Faster-than-light particles at CERN, paradigm-shifting discovery or another Swiss export as full of holes as their cheese? And converse.",5,Big Bang Theory,148,21
22504,Penny,8," All right, who wants to go to my apartment and look at bridal magazines?",5,Big Bang Theory,73,14
22506,Penny,8," Through no one's fault, Sheldon, we're leaving.",5,Big Bang Theory,48,7
22507,Amy,8, Wait for moi.,5,Big Bang Theory,14,3
22508,Sheldon,8, You're leaving?,5,Big Bang Theory,16,2
22509,Amy,8," Sheldon, sometimes you forget, I'm a lady. And with that comes an oestrogen fuelled need to page through thick glossy magazines that make me hate my body.",5,Big Bang Theory,155,27
22510,Sheldon,8," Ah. New topic. Women, delightfully mysterious or bat-crap crazy?",5,Big Bang Theory,65,9
22511,Raj,8," Totally. What's wrong with cap sleeves? If you have the right figure for it, they're adorable.",5,Big Bang Theory,95,16
22513,Leonard,8," Hey, Amy, what brings you to our neck of the woods?",5,Big Bang Theory,52,11
22514,Amy,8, Your neurology department loaned me a culture of prions for my research on bovine spongiform encephalopathy.,5,Big Bang Theory,109,16
22515,Sheldon,8, She popped by to borrow a cup of mad cow disease.,5,Big Bang Theory,50,11
22516,Amy,8," It's hard to make degenerative brain maladies hilarious, and yet somehow you do it.",5,Big Bang Theory,84,14
22517,Howard,8, That's fun to have in a lunchroom.,5,Big Bang Theory,35,7
22518,Amy,8," The real fun starts when you get to pick the rat you're going to feed it to, and maybe you choose the beady-eyed little mother who's been biting you all week.",5,Big Bang Theory,159,31
22519,Howard,8," Please, we're eating. Can we get that off the table and change the subject?",5,Big Bang Theory,76,14
22520,Sheldon,8, Can we? Stand back while I turn this conversation into a conver-sensation.,5,Big Bang Theory,75,12
22521,Leonard,8," This time, it's your fault.",5,Big Bang Theory,28,5
22522,Sheldon,8," I have 100 alphabetized topics from artichoke, come on, people, it's just a giant thistle, to zzz, the onamona-poetry of sleep.",5,Big Bang Theory,128,21
22523,Leonard,8," Amy, how long would it take for that mad cow disease to kill me?",5,Big Bang Theory,65,14
22524,Amy,8," I don't know, four or five years.",5,Big Bang Theory,34,7
22525,Leonard,8," No, it's not gonna do it.",5,Big Bang Theory,26,6
22526,Howard,8, Oy. Bernadette keeps texting me pictures of Penny in bridesmaid dresses.,5,Big Bang Theory,73,11
22527,Amy,8, They're out shopping right now?,5,Big Bang Theory,32,5
22528,Howard,8, Yeah.,5,Big Bang Theory,6,1
22529,Amy,8, Just the two of them?,5,Big Bang Theory,22,5
22530,Howard,8, I guess.,5,Big Bang Theory,9,2
22531,Amy,8," That's cool, that's cool.",5,Big Bang Theory,26,4
22532,Howard,8, Why are they asking me about this stuff? What guy knows what a sweetheart neckline is? ,5,Big Bang Theory,88,16
22534,Leonard,8," Leonard's coming down the home stretch! Come on, horsey, you can do this! Damn. Come on, thigh muscles, you can do this! Yes! First place. I would have been a great jockey if I weren't too tall. And scared of horses. Sheldon, you're up.",5,Big Bang Theory,237,44
22535,Sheldon,8, What?,5,Big Bang Theory,6,1
22536,Leonard,8," Come on, it's your turn. We said we'd get more fresh air.",5,Big Bang Theory,58,12
22537,Sheldon,8," Sorry. I'm a little distracted. I can't seem to get in touch with Amy. I tried e-mail, video chat, tweeting her, posting on her Facebook wall, texting her, nothing.",5,Big Bang Theory,165,29
22538,Leonard,8, Did you try calling her on the telephone?,5,Big Bang Theory,42,8
22539,Sheldon,8," The telephone. You know, Leonard, in your own simple way, you may be the wisest of us all. Voice mail. Curiouser and curiouser.",5,Big Bang Theory,128,23
22540,Leonard,8," If you're worried, we can go over there and see if she's all right.",5,Big Bang Theory,68,14
22541,Sheldon,8," Okay. You know, I heard in the news a bobcat has been spotted in her neighbourhood.",5,Big Bang Theory,84,16
22542,Leonard,8, I don't think Amy was eaten by a bobcat.,5,Big Bang Theory,41,9
22543,Sheldon,8, Who thinks Amy was eaten by a bobcat?,5,Big Bang Theory,38,8
22544,Leonard,8, You do?,5,Big Bang Theory,8,2
22545,Sheldon,8," Leonard, I was just mentioning an interesting local news item. Now, thanks to you, I'm worried Amy's been eaten by a bobcat.",5,Big Bang Theory,125,22
22546,Leonard,8, Forget about the bobcat.,5,Big Bang Theory,25,4
22547,Sheldon,8, How can I? You won't stop talking about it.,5,Big Bang Theory,44,9
22549,Amy,8," Everybody hurts, sometimes everybody cries. Everybody hurts, sometimes.",5,Big Bang Theory,72,8
22550,Sheldon,8, She sounds weepy. I don't like weepy. Let's go.,5,Big Bang Theory,48,9
22551,Leonard,8," Uh, she's your friend. Step up.",5,Big Bang Theory,32,6
22552,Leonard,8,  Amy.  Amy.  Amy. Bye.,5,Big Bang Theory,23,4
22553,Sheldon,8, Where are you going?,5,Big Bang Theory,21,4
22554,Leonard,8," I'm single, I don't need this crap.",5,Big Bang Theory,36,7
22555,Amy,8," Sheldon, what are you doing here?",5,Big Bang Theory,34,6
22556,Sheldon,8, You didn't respond to any of my electronic communications.,5,Big Bang Theory,59,9
22557,Amy,8, I wanted to be alone.,5,Big Bang Theory,22,5
22558,Sheldon,8, Would you like to talk about it? And keep in mind that no is a perfectly viable answer.,5,Big Bang Theory,88,18
22559,Amy,8," Sheldon, my world is crumbling around me.",5,Big Bang Theory,42,7
22560,Sheldon,8," Point of order. As you're in distress, it would be customary for me to offer you a hot beverage. But I'm a guest in your home, so it would be customary for you to offer me a beverage. How do you want to proceed vis-a-vis beverages?",5,Big Bang Theory,232,46
22561,Amy,8, It doesn't matter. Nothing matters.,5,Big Bang Theory,36,5
22562,Sheldon,8," If you'd like to take your mind off what's troubling you, uh, word on the street is a bobcat has been spotted.",5,Big Bang Theory,111,22
22563,Amy,8, Penny and Bernadette went shopping for bridesmaids dresses without me.,5,Big Bang Theory,71,10
22564,Sheldon,8, And that made you feel sad?,5,Big Bang Theory,28,6
22565,Amy,8, Yes.,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
22566,Sheldon,8," I knew it. Just keep going, I guess I'm good at this.",5,Big Bang Theory,54,12
22567,Amy,8," It's just, I thought they liked hanging out with me, but I guess I was fooling myself.",5,Big Bang Theory,87,17
22568,Sheldon,8," When they were over here, did you fail to offer them a beverage? â€˜Cause I can see how that could stick in someone's craw.",5,Big Bang Theory,124,24
22569,Amy,8," Sheldon, I'm going to ask you something, and I'd like you to keep an open mind.",5,Big Bang Theory,80,16
22570,Sheldon,8, Always.,5,Big Bang Theory,8,1
22571,Amy,8," At this moment, I find myself craving human intimacy and physical contact.",5,Big Bang Theory,75,12
22572,Sheldon,8," Oh, boy. You know ours is a relationship of the mind.",5,Big Bang Theory,54,11
22573,Amy,8, Proposal. One wild night of torrid lovemaking that soothes my soul and inflames my loins.,5,Big Bang Theory,90,15
22574,Sheldon,8," Counterproposal. I will gently stroke your head and repeat, aw, who's a good Amy.",5,Big Bang Theory,82,14
22575,Amy,8," How about this? French kissing, seven minutes in heaven culminating in second base.",5,Big Bang Theory,84,13
22576,Sheldon,8," Neck massage, then you get me that beverage.",5,Big Bang Theory,45,8
22577,Amy,8, We cuddle. Final offer.,5,Big Bang Theory,24,4
22578,Sheldon,8," Very well. Oh, boy. ",5,Big Bang Theory,21,4
22579,Amy,8," I'm just saying, second base is right there.",5,Big Bang Theory,45,8
22581,Raj,8," Mm, I'm thinking about adopting some quirky affectation, like a pipe or a monocle or a handlebar moustache.",5,Big Bang Theory,108,18
22582,Leonard,8, For all those girls out there looking for the Indian Monopoly man?,5,Big Bang Theory,67,12
22583,Raj,8, This is not a safe place. You can't share anything here.,5,Big Bang Theory,57,11
22584,Sheldon,8, The two of you need to get your women in line!,5,Big Bang Theory,47,11
22585,Howard,8, What?,5,Big Bang Theory,6,1
22586,Sheldon,8," Last night I was strong-armed into an evening of harp music and spooning with an emotional Amy Farrah Fowler. This on a night that I had originally designated for solving the space-time geometry in higher-spin gravity and building my Lego Death Star. And why? Your gal pals, Penny and Bernadette, went out shopping for some wedding nonsense without Amy, an action they took with no thought or regard as to how it would affect me, the future of string theory or my Lego fun time.",5,Big Bang Theory,479,85
22587,Howard,8, What do you want us to do about it?,5,Big Bang Theory,36,9
22588,Sheldon,8," You clearly weren't listening to my topic sentence, get your women in line! You make them apologize to Amy and set things right. I am a man of science, not someone's snuggle bunny!",5,Big Bang Theory,181,33
22589,Leonard,8, Why do I have to talk to Penny? She's not my girlfriend.,5,Big Bang Theory,57,12
22590,Sheldon,8," You invited her to lunch four years ago. Everything about her is on you, you make it so!",5,Big Bang Theory,89,18
22592,Leonard,8, Moo-shu is Penny.,5,Big Bang Theory,18,3
22593,Penny,8, Thank you. Where's Sheldon?,5,Big Bang Theory,28,4
22594,Leonard,8," Oh, he was up late last night, so I gave him an early dinner and put him to bed.",5,Big Bang Theory,81,19
22596,Leonard,8," Yeah, but now he's gonna be up at dawn and want to play.",5,Big Bang Theory,57,13
22597,Howard,8," So, listen, guys, the reason he was up late is because he was taking care of Amy. She's kind of upset.",5,Big Bang Theory,103,21
22598,Penny,8, Why?,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
22599,Leonard,8, Her feelings got hurt because you guys went dress shopping without her.,5,Big Bang Theory,72,12
22601,Penny,8," Okay, look, this is her first time being a bridesmaid and she's just getting a little crazy with it.",5,Big Bang Theory,101,19
22603,Penny,8," Yeah, and she keeps trying to figure out if our cycles have synced up so we can call ourselves the Three Menstra-teers",5,Big Bang Theory,119,22
22605,Penny,8," I know. Me, too. We'll talk to her. Hey, wait, how did she find out?",5,Big Bang Theory,69,15
22606,Howard,8," Raj did it. And he says he would do it again. Okay, I'm sorry. You sent me the picture, I wasn't thinking.",5,Big Bang Theory,107,22
22608,Howard,8," Well, hey, I'm usually pretty good at not blabbing. You tell me tons of stuff about these guys, and I never repeat it.",5,Big Bang Theory,119,23
22609,Penny,8, What do you tell him?,5,Big Bang Theory,22,5
22611,Leonard,8," Hold on, did you talk about us when we were dating?",5,Big Bang Theory,52,11
22612,Penny,8, No. All your little secrets are fine.,5,Big Bang Theory,38,7
22614,Howard,8, I'll tell you later.,5,Big Bang Theory,21,4
22616,Amy,8," Come on, tumour. Come on, tumour, Mama needs an aggressive little glioblastoma. Yay, brain tumour! Probably not the same reaction you had when you got the news.",5,Big Bang Theory,161,27
22617,Penny,8, Hi.,5,Big Bang Theory,4,1
22619,Amy,8, What are you doing here?,5,Big Bang Theory,25,5
22620,Penny,8," Well, look, we just wanted to apologize for not bringing you with us the other day.",5,Big Bang Theory,84,16
22621,Amy,8," That's not necessary, it's like Sesame Street says, one of these things is not like the other, one of these things should die alone.",5,Big Bang Theory,133,24
22622,Penny,8," Look, come on, Amy, look, let us make it up to you. We'll have a girl's night, we'll do whatever you want.",5,Big Bang Theory,107,22
22624,Penny,8," With-with loofah mitts, no hands.",5,Big Bang Theory,34,5
22625,Amy,8, It's okay. I'm glad this happened. I can stop pretending that some beautiful girl and her cute-in-,5,Big Bang Theory,99,17
22627,Penny,8," Yeah, we feel awful.",5,Big Bang Theory,21,4
22628,Amy,8," Don't. I'll be okay. You're not the first girls I thought were friends with me who ended up shunning me. It's like elementary school, junior high, high school, undergrad, grad school, and that semester abroad in Norway all over again.",5,Big Bang Theory,235,40
22629,Penny,8," Oh, come on, Amy.",5,Big Bang Theory,18,4
22630,Amy,8, You don't get it. Look at this brain.,5,Big Bang Theory,38,8
22631,Penny,8, I don't really want to.,5,Big Bang Theory,24,5
22632,Amy,8," This is us. Bernadette, you are the analytical, scientific left hemisphere. Penny, you're the creative, spontaneous right hemisphere. And where's Amy? She's right here, the sad little tumour no one wants to go dress shopping with.",5,Big Bang Theory,231,36
22635,Sheldon,8," Did you know that when Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone, he proposed answering it with ahoy? Ahoy. I like it. Amy? Is that you? Have you been drinking? I'm sorry, I bet my sweet what? Well, all right. We're on our way.",5,Big Bang Theory,231,43
22636,Leonard,8, What's going on?,5,Big Bang Theory,17,3
22637,Sheldon,8, It would seem Amy is drunk in a liquor store parking lot.,5,Big Bang Theory,58,12
22638,Leonard,8, Really? Amy?,5,Big Bang Theory,13,2
22639,Sheldon,8," Leonard, be glad you can't keep a woman. They are a handful.",5,Big Bang Theory,61,12
22641,Amy,8," Oh, look. It's Sheldon and little Leonard. Hi, little Leonard.",5,Big Bang Theory,63,10
22642,Leonard,8," Hi, Amy.",5,Big Bang Theory,9,2
22643,Amy,8," Hey, Cuddles.",5,Big Bang Theory,14,2
22644,Leonard,8, Cuddles?,5,Big Bang Theory,9,1
22645,Sheldon,8," Yes, Cuddles. We cuddled. Grow up, Leonard.",5,Big Bang Theory,44,7
22646,Leonard,8," Amy, what are you doing here?",5,Big Bang Theory,30,6
22647,Amy,8," Well, I came here to get a bottle of wine like Penny taught me to do when you're sad.",5,Big Bang Theory,86,19
22648,Leonard,8," Yeah, but why didn't you go back to your apartment?",5,Big Bang Theory,52,10
22649,Amy,8," Didn't you go to high school, Leonard? Parking lots are where all the cool kids hang out. Not that the rat bastards ever invited me.",5,Big Bang Theory,133,25
22650,Leonard,8, Maybe we should get you home.,5,Big Bang Theory,30,6
22651,Amy,8," Oh, hang on, hang on, hang on. Sheldon, what would it take for you to go into that liquor store, buy a bottle of hooch, take me across the street to that motel, and have your way with me?",5,Big Bang Theory,188,39
22652,Leonard,8," Yeah, Sheldon, what would it take?",5,Big Bang Theory,35,6
22653,Sheldon,8," I'm begging both of you, please, let's go.",5,Big Bang Theory,43,8
22654,Leonard,8, Okay. Come on. Upsy-daisy.,5,Big Bang Theory,27,4
22655,Amy,8," Whee! Ooh, finally someone found second base.",5,Big Bang Theory,46,7
22657,Amy,8," I know how you feel. I got a knife slicing through my frontal lobe, too.",5,Big Bang Theory,73,15
22658,Penny,8, Hi.,5,Big Bang Theory,4,1
22659,Amy,8, What do you want? Do you want me to give the friendship bracelet back?,5,Big Bang Theory,71,14
22660,Penny,8, I never gave you a friendship bracelet.,5,Big Bang Theory,40,7
22661,Amy,8," When we first met, I made one and pretended you gave it to me. You can have it back if you want.",5,Big Bang Theory,97,22
22662,Penny,8," No, you made that for you, I want you to have it.",5,Big Bang Theory,50,12
22664,Penny,8," We are really sorry, and we were trying to think of some way to show you how much we care about you.",5,Big Bang Theory,101,22
22666,Amy,8," What? Wait, is this some kind of practical joke? Like in Norway, when my friends trapped me in a sauna with a horny otter?",5,Big Bang Theory,123,24
22668,Amy,8," Oh, my gosh. No one's every asked me to be the maid of honour before. Well, that's not true. Once, but then they all died.",5,Big Bang Theory,123,25
22670,Amy,8," Yes. Yes. Oh, my gosh, I, I have so much to do. There's the bridal shower and the bachelorette party. What should we do for the bachelorette party? Oh, I know, we'll go to a Native American sweat lodge, we'll take peyote, roll around in the mud, and paint fertility symbols on Bernadette's naked body. So that's happening.",5,Big Bang Theory,323,58
22671,Penny,8," Yeah, sure, sure. Vegas is fun, too.",5,Big Bang Theory,37,7
22672,Amy,8," I feel like crying. Of course, I could just be hormonal. Oh, wait. Maybe our menses are finally syncing up. Bernadette? No? Penny?",5,Big Bang Theory,131,23
22673,Penny,8, Sorry.,5,Big Bang Theory,7,1
22674,Amy,8, Really?,5,Big Bang Theory,8,1
22675,Penny,8," Okay, yeah.",5,Big Bang Theory,12,2
22676,Amy,8, Yay!,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
22678,Amy,8," Maid of honour Amy Farrah Fowler's amazing behind-the-scenes wedding video, take one.",5,Big Bang Theory,86,12
22680,Amy,8," I'm sorry, are you the maid of honour?",5,Big Bang Theory,39,8
22682,Amy,8, So no. And action.,5,Big Bang Theory,19,4
22683,Penny,8, What do you think?,5,Big Bang Theory,19,4
22685,Amy,8," What are you, a nun? Come on, bestie, let's see some skin.",5,Big Bang Theory,59,12
22687,Amy,8, You think they don't have mirrors in there? I know how I look.,5,Big Bang Theory,63,13
22688,Penny,8," Oh! Bernadette, you look beautiful!",5,Big Bang Theory,36,5
22689,Amy,8, You do.,5,Big Bang Theory,8,2
22691,Amy,8," Not Penny beautiful, but beautiful.",5,Big Bang Theory,36,5
22692,Amy,8," Come on, bestie, you're up.",5,Big Bang Theory,28,5
22693,Penny,8, Give me a minute.,5,Big Bang Theory,18,4
22694,Amy,8, What is taking you so long? ,5,Big Bang Theory,29,6
22695,Penny,8," Oh, Amy! Get the hell out of here!",5,Big Bang Theory,35,8
22696,Amy,8," â€“ Sorry, sorry. ",5,Big Bang Theory,19,3
22697,Penny,8," Oh, God. Amy!",5,Big Bang Theory,14,3
22698,Amy,8, Sorry.,5,Big Bang Theory,7,1
22700,Penny,9, Hey.,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
22701,Leonard,9," Oh, hey. You work the lunch shift?",5,Big Bang Theory,35,7
22702,Penny,9, Yeah. I've got eight pounds of salmon that's about to go bad. Do you know how to cook it?,5,Big Bang Theory,90,19
22703,Leonard,9, Not really.,5,Big Bang Theory,12,2
22704,Penny,9, Damn it. Should have liberated the iffy chicken. What are you and Professor Fussyface up to tonight?,5,Big Bang Theory,101,17
22705,Leonard,9, Star Wars on Blu-ray.,5,Big Bang Theory,22,4
22706,Penny,9," Haven't you seen that movie, like, a thousand times?",5,Big Bang Theory,53,9
22707,Leonard,9, Not on Blu-ray. Only twice on Blu-ray.,5,Big Bang Theory,39,7
22708,Penny,9," Oh, Leonard.",5,Big Bang Theory,13,2
22709,Leonard,9," I know, it's high-resolution sadness.",5,Big Bang Theory,38,5
22710,Penny,9," Well, I'm going to take myself out to a movie tonight. You want to go?",5,Big Bang Theory,71,15
22711,Leonard,9, Really? Do we do that?,5,Big Bang Theory,23,5
22712,Penny,9, What do you mean?,5,Big Bang Theory,18,4
22713,Leonard,9," You know, we haven't spent time alone together since we broke up.",5,Big Bang Theory,66,12
22714,Penny,9," Oh, it's not a date, Leonard. It's just a man and a woman hanging out, and not having sex at the end of the night.",5,Big Bang Theory,115,25
22715,Leonard,9, Sounds like most of my dates.,5,Big Bang Theory,30,6
22716,Sheldon,9," Oh, dear Lord, get away from me, you monster!",5,Big Bang Theory,46,9
22717,Penny,9, What is that about?,5,Big Bang Theory,20,4
22718,Leonard,9," Well, he's smart and crazy enough, he may have actually created a monster. ",5,Big Bang Theory,76,13
22719,Sheldon,9," Shoo, shoo! Be gone!",5,Big Bang Theory,21,4
22720,Leonard,9, What the hell is going on?,5,Big Bang Theory,27,6
22721,Sheldon,9," There's a bird outside the window, and he won't go away. That is the hell that is going on. We have no worms or seeds here. Shoo, shoo.",5,Big Bang Theory,136,28
22722,Penny,9," Really? On top of everything else, you're afraid of birds?",5,Big Bang Theory,59,10
22723,Sheldon,9," It's called ornithophobia. And someday it will be recognized as a true disability, and the landlord will be required by law to put a giant net over the building. Which is unfortunate, because I have a fear of nets.",5,Big Bang Theory,215,39
22724,Penny,9," So movies, yes or no?",5,Big Bang Theory,22,5
22725,Leonard,9," Movies, yes.",5,Big Bang Theory,13,2
22726,Penny,9," Great. I'll see you later. And remember, he's more afraid of you than you are of him.",5,Big Bang Theory,86,17
22727,Sheldon,9, That doesn't help.,5,Big Bang Theory,19,3
22728,Penny,9," No, I was talking to the bird.",5,Big Bang Theory,31,7
22729,Sheldon,9,"  Go away, bird.  Go away, bird.  Go away, bird.",5,Big Bang Theory,48,9
22730,Leonard,9," Sheldon, just ignore him.",5,Big Bang Theory,26,4
22731,Sheldon,9," Good idea. Attention is what birds want.  Oh, much better. All right. Now I'll just get along with my life.  Make a pot of tea, Leonard. It's going to be a long night.",5,Big Bang Theory,168,33
22733,Leonard,9, The bird's still there?,5,Big Bang Theory,24,4
22734,Sheldon,9," Quick, what does a hawk sound like?",5,Big Bang Theory,36,7
22735,Leonard,9, I don't know. Scree-scree.,5,Big Bang Theory,27,4
22736,Sheldon,9," Please, that's a seagull. If you're not going to help, don't help.",5,Big Bang Theory,67,12
22737,Leonard,9, Sorry. Do you think I'm overdressed?,5,Big Bang Theory,37,6
22738,Sheldon,9," It depends on the activity. For a prostate exam, yes. If you're playing Vegas, I'd add sequins.",5,Big Bang Theory,96,17
22739,Leonard,9, I'm going to the movies with Penny. I don't want her to think that I think it's a date.,5,Big Bang Theory,88,19
22740,Sheldon,9, Do you think it's a date?,5,Big Bang Theory,26,6
22741,Leonard,9," No, but she might think I think it's a date even though I don't.",5,Big Bang Theory,65,14
22742,Sheldon,9, Or you might think she thinks you think it's a date even though she doesn't.,5,Big Bang Theory,77,15
22743,Leonard,9, Are we overthinking this?,5,Big Bang Theory,26,4
22744,Sheldon,9, Not at all.,5,Big Bang Theory,12,3
22745,Leonard,9, You're right. I'm fine. I'm wearing this.,5,Big Bang Theory,42,7
22746,Sheldon,9," Really? A blazer? All right.  Yes, hello. This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I'm at 2311 North Robles Avenue. Yeah, I'd like to report a dangerous wild animal. A blue jay. I'm sorry, this is Animal Control. I don't understand the laughter. No, the bird is not in my home. If he was in my home, I obviously would have called 911. Sir, I have no doubt that there are things that you're frightened of. Being stuck in a dead-end public service job? Or your wife stepping out on you because you're stuck in a dead-end public service job? Or spiders? Don't you think I tried making cat noises?",5,Big Bang Theory,587,109
22747,Leonard,9, Too casual?,5,Big Bang Theory,12,2
22748,Sheldon,9," For an audience with the queen, yes. For an evening of passing a bottle of fortified wine around a flaming trash can, you look great.  What am I thinking? Whiskers!",5,Big Bang Theory,165,30
22750,Penny,9," Oh, hey, if we hurry, we can make the new Jennifer Aniston movie.",5,Big Bang Theory,66,13
22751,Leonard,9," Oh, yeah, sure. There's also an amazing documentary about building a dam on river in South America.",5,Big Bang Theory,100,17
22752,Penny,9," Okay, but the Jennifer Aniston movie has Jennifer Aniston, and she's not building a dam.",5,Big Bang Theory,89,15
22753,Leonard,9, Can't argue with that. I'll get the tickets.,5,Big Bang Theory,45,8
22754,Penny,9, Okay.,5,Big Bang Theory,6,1
22755,Leonard,9," Actually, you know what? I think it's about time I pick a movie we see.",5,Big Bang Theory,72,15
22756,Penny,9, You pick plenty of movies.,5,Big Bang Theory,27,5
22757,Leonard,9," No. You always picked, and it was always the same. An hour and a half of beach houses in the rain until the woman turns around and realizes love was here all along.",5,Big Bang Theory,165,33
22758,Penny,9," But come on, that is a great movie, and it starts in ten minutes.",5,Big Bang Theory,66,14
22759,Leonard,9, I hate those movies.,5,Big Bang Theory,21,4
22760,Penny,9," No, you don't.",5,Big Bang Theory,15,3
22761,Leonard,9," Yes, I do. The only reason I went is because you wanted to see them, and I wanted to have sex. To this day, I can't see a Sandra Bullock movie poster without getting both bored and aroused.",5,Big Bang Theory,190,38
22762,Penny,9," Okay, so while we were going out, how often would you pretend to like things just to have sex with me?",5,Big Bang Theory,103,21
22763,Leonard,9, All the time.,5,Big Bang Theory,14,3
22764,Penny,9, You're kidding.,5,Big Bang Theory,16,2
22765,Leonard,9," Does this sound familiar? I'd love to go shoe shopping with you. Hiking? It's great. It's two a.m., of course I want to go to Korea Town and sing karaoke with your friends. Who wouldn't?",5,Big Bang Theory,187,35
22766,Penny,9," Okay, we were going out. You were going to get sex anyway.",5,Big Bang Theory,59,12
22767,Leonard,9, Really? You would have slept with me after a three-hour documentary on dams?,5,Big Bang Theory,77,13
22768,Penny,9, No. No woman would.,5,Big Bang Theory,20,4
22769,Leonard,9," See? Now, that's the great thing. We're out as friends. This is not a date. Sex is off the table. So, let's go learn why hydroelectric power might not be the environmental bargain you think it is. Sorry. Spoiler alert.",5,Big Bang Theory,219,40
22770,Penny,9," All right, fine.",5,Big Bang Theory,17,3
22771,Leonard,9, Thanks. Tickets are eleven bucks. Not a date.,5,Big Bang Theory,46,8
22773,Raj,9," Come on, Sheldon, Star Wars.",5,Big Bang Theory,29,5
22774,Howard,9, I'm pushing play.,5,Big Bang Theory,18,3
22775,Sheldon,9, A minute.,5,Big Bang Theory,10,2
22776,Howard,9," If we don't start soon, George Lucas is going to change it again.",5,Big Bang Theory,66,13
22777,Sheldon,9, This would go a lot faster if you put your trade school diploma to work and helped me set up this high frequency tone generator.,5,Big Bang Theory,129,25
22778,Howard,9, I have a Masters degree from M.I.T.,5,Big Bang Theory,36,7
22779,Sheldon,9," Yeah, but you've got a can-do attitude and that's what's important.",5,Big Bang Theory,68,11
22780,Raj,9, I really don't get your problem with birds.,5,Big Bang Theory,44,8
22781,Sheldon,9," The question you should be asking is what is their problem with me? My first memory, a hummingbird dive-bombing my stroller to get at the apple juice in my sippy cup.",5,Big Bang Theory,167,31
22782,Raj,9, Hummingbirds are pretty.,5,Big Bang Theory,25,3
22783,Sheldon,9, Hummingbirds are the vampires of the flower world.,5,Big Bang Theory,51,8
22784,Raj,9," Still my first choice for an ankle tattoo. Or a dolphin, I go back and forth.",5,Big Bang Theory,78,16
22785,Sheldon,9," Age seven, a blood-thirsty chicken chases me up a tree. Age twelve, a magpie tries to steal the retainer out of my mouth. Age sixteen, a parrot in a pet store called me fat ass. Need I go on?",5,Big Bang Theory,192,39
22786,Raj,9," Yes, please. This is way better than the movie.",5,Big Bang Theory,48,9
22787,Howard,9," All right, Sheldon, your bird death ray is ready.",5,Big Bang Theory,50,9
22788,Sheldon,9," It's not a death ray. It's just a little ultrasonic blast to scare him off. Trust me, if I had a death ray, I wouldn't be living here. I'd be in my lair enjoying the money the people of Earth gave me for not using my death ray. All right, and in three, two, one. ",5,Big Bang Theory,264,55
22789,Raj,9, That is one tough birdie.,5,Big Bang Theory,26,5
22791,Leonard,9," Come on, you enjoyed the movie. I saw you tearing up when the village got flooded, and everyone had to relocate.",5,Big Bang Theory,113,21
22792,Penny,9," No, I was thinking how come they get to leave and I can't.",5,Big Bang Theory,59,13
22793,Leonard,9, I'm going to get some fries. You want anything?,5,Big Bang Theory,48,9
22794,Penny,9," Uh, no, thanks.",5,Big Bang Theory,16,3
22795,Leonard,9," Are you sure? Because you always say no, and then you eat half my fries.",5,Big Bang Theory,73,15
22796,Penny,9, I just eat the little crispy ones you don't like.,5,Big Bang Theory,50,10
22797,Leonard,9," No, I love them. I save them for the end, but they're gone because you ate them. And why did I let you eat them?",5,Big Bang Theory,113,25
22798,Penny,9, To get sex.,5,Big Bang Theory,12,3
22799,Leonard,9," Exactly. But this is not a date. So I ask again, would you like anything?",5,Big Bang Theory,74,15
22800,Penny,9," All right, I'd like an order of fries.",5,Big Bang Theory,39,8
22801,Leonard,9, Great. That'll be five dollars. I am having the best time. I'm so glad you suggested we do this.,5,Big Bang Theory,97,19
22802,Penny,9," Oh, sorry.",5,Big Bang Theory,11,2
22804,Penny,9, What you writing there?,5,Big Bang Theory,24,4
22807,Penny,9, Oh.,5,Big Bang Theory,4,1
22809,Penny,9, Oh. Penny. Nice to meet you.,5,Big Bang Theory,29,6
22811,Penny,9," Oh, no, no. This isn't a date, no. Right?",5,Big Bang Theory,42,9
22812,Leonard,9," Uh, right.",5,Big Bang Theory,11,2
22813,Penny,9, So have you written anything I might have seen?,5,Big Bang Theory,48,9
22816,Sheldon,9," This is ridiculous. I'm a grown man from Texas. This isn't a terrifying bird like a swan or a goose. It's just a blue jay.  That's a pretty big blue jay.  One, two, three.  Go! Shoo! Am-scray, ird-bay!  Bird in the apartment! Bird in the apartment!  No!",5,Big Bang Theory,254,47
22818,Penny,9," So it is an amazing documentary. They need the electricity from the dam, but at the same time they want to preserve the environment.",5,Big Bang Theory,133,24
22819,Leonard,9," You're kidding me. Uh, can I see you for a sec over here?",5,Big Bang Theory,58,13
22820,Penny,9," Oh, yeah. Sure. Just one sec?",5,Big Bang Theory,30,6
22822,Penny,9, What's up?,5,Big Bang Theory,11,2
22823,Leonard,9, I know what you're doing.,5,Big Bang Theory,26,5
22824,Penny,9, What am I doing?,5,Big Bang Theory,17,4
22825,Leonard,9, You're going out of your way to talk to that guy because I said we weren't on a date.,5,Big Bang Theory,86,19
22826,Penny,9," No, I'm talking to him because he's cute.",5,Big Bang Theory,42,8
22827,Leonard,9," Come on, he's not that cute.",5,Big Bang Theory,29,6
22828,Penny,9," Yes, he is. With his dorky T-shirt and his little hipster glasses.",5,Big Bang Theory,67,12
22829,Leonard,9, I wear dorky T-shirts and glasses.,5,Big Bang Theory,35,6
22830,Penny,9," Yes, but when you're tall and have great cheekbones, you're doing it ironically.",5,Big Bang Theory,81,13
22831,Leonard,9," If that's so, what if I start talking to a girl?",5,Big Bang Theory,49,11
22832,Penny,9, You should.,5,Big Bang Theory,12,2
22833,Leonard,9, I'm serious. I'll do it.,5,Big Bang Theory,25,5
22834,Penny,9, Good! Go! There are some girls right over there. What are you waiting for?,5,Big Bang Theory,75,14
22835,Leonard,9, They're in a group. I'm scared.,5,Big Bang Theory,32,6
22837,Amy,9," Sheldon, what do you expect us to do?",5,Big Bang Theory,38,8
22838,Sheldon,9," You're biologists. Biology is the study of living things. That's a living thing, get cracking.",5,Big Bang Theory,95,15
22840,Amy,9," Yeah, neither of us minored in bird-shooing.",5,Big Bang Theory,45,7
22841,Sheldon,9," Oh, come now. Your undergraduate work must have included a varmints and critters class.",5,Big Bang Theory,88,14
22843,Sheldon,9," No, Bernadette, don't be a hero!",5,Big Bang Theory,33,6
22845,Sheldon,9," Yes. It's very sweet. Now, slowly and carefully, flush him down the toilet.",5,Big Bang Theory,76,13
22846,Amy,9," Sheldon, the only way to get past this fear is to interact with it. Just like you did with the mailman.",5,Big Bang Theory,104,21
22847,Sheldon,9, Every year tens of people around the world are killed by birds. I'm not going to be another statistic.,5,Big Bang Theory,103,19
22849,Sheldon,9," I did it! I actually did it. Okay, now flush him.",5,Big Bang Theory,50,11
22852,Leonard,9," Um, let's see. Hiking. Karaoke in Koreatown. Any Jennifer Aniston movie.",5,Big Bang Theory,73,11
22853,Penny,9, Hey. Sorry I ditched you.,5,Big Bang Theory,26,5
22854,Leonard,9," No, it's fine. You can ditch away.",5,Big Bang Theory,35,7
22855,Penny,9," Oh, no, no. We said we were going to hang out, let's hang out.",5,Big Bang Theory,63,14
22856,Leonard,9, It's cool. Go back to Kevin.,5,Big Bang Theory,29,6
22857,Penny,9," Oh, he had to leave.",5,Big Bang Theory,21,5
22858,Leonard,9," Interesting. So now that he's gone, you want to hang out with me.",5,Big Bang Theory,66,13
22860,Leonard,9, Yep.,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
22862,Penny,9," Huh? I'm sorry, get what?",5,Big Bang Theory,26,5
22863,Leonard,9," Don't worry about it. You know, there's some guys over there. You should go talk to them.",5,Big Bang Theory,90,17
22864,Penny,9," No, no. I want to know what you told her.",5,Big Bang Theory,42,10
22865,Leonard,9, That's kind of between me and,5,Big Bang Theory,30,6
22867,Leonard,9, Laura.,5,Big Bang Theory,7,1
22868,Penny,9," Oh. Okay, I see. So while he was telling you things, did he mention he owns not one, but two Star Trek uniforms?",5,Big Bang Theory,113,23
22870,Penny,9, Yeah. Wears them. Not just for Halloween.,5,Big Bang Theory,42,7
22871,Leonard,9," Hey, pal. You didn't see me telling Kevin that you thought cold wars were only fought in winter.",5,Big Bang Theory,97,18
22872,Penny,9," Okay. Then I'll return the favour, and I won't tell",5,Big Bang Theory,52,10
22874,Penny,9, Laura that half the dirty movies you own are animated.,5,Big Bang Theory,55,10
22875,Leonard,9," When you were telling Kevin about your acting career, did you mention your long-running role as Waitress in a local production of The Cheesecake Factory?",5,Big Bang Theory,154,25
22876,Penny,9, Did you tell her about your lucky asthma inhaler?,5,Big Bang Theory,50,9
22877,Leonard,9," Oh, yeah? Spell asthma.",5,Big Bang Theory,24,4
22878,Penny,9, A S Take me home.,5,Big Bang Theory,18,5
22879,Leonard,9," Maybe I'm not done hanging out with  You're right, it's getting late.",5,Big Bang Theory,70,12
22881,Sheldon,9," It's remarkable. All that time spent in fear. And for what? He's magnificent. Oh, dear. I just realized I haven't offered you a beverage.",5,Big Bang Theory,138,24
22883,Sheldon,9," My phone's on the desk over there. Take a picture of us together. Make it good enough to go on a mug, a mouse pad, and a calendar. If you were a dove, I'd call you Lovey-Dovey. Oh. Who am I kidding? This isn't a moment for strict adherence to the literal. You're just my little Lovey-Dovey, aren't you?",5,Big Bang Theory,303,59
22884,Amy,9, Guess you gotta have hollow bones to get some sugar around here.,5,Big Bang Theory,65,12
22886,Sheldon,9," Yes. It should have a big picture of him, and the words, is this your bird? Not anymore. We're going to have so much fun together. You can carry messages to all my enemies. I can tie a string to your leg and fly you like a kite.",5,Big Bang Theory,229,48
22887,Amy,9," If you're keeping him, I've got a cage you can borrow. One of the test monkeys slipped on a banana peel and broke his neck. It was both tragic and hysterical.",5,Big Bang Theory,159,31
22888,Sheldon,9," Nonsense. No. Lovey-Dovey doesn't sleep in a cage. No. Lovey-Dovey sleeps in his very own nest, which I'm going to get off the windowsill and put in my room. Isn't that right, LD?  No. Where are you going? Come back, Lovey-Dovey! This is your home now! I already ordered 20 pounds of bird feed off of Amazon! He's gone.",5,Big Bang Theory,320,59
22889,Amy,9," I'm sorry, Sheldon.",5,Big Bang Theory,20,3
22890,Sheldon,9," How could he do this to me? Get back here, you stupid bird, so I can love you!",5,Big Bang Theory,79,18
22892,Leonard,9," Okay. So, we went out, saw a movie, met some nice people, said horrible things about each other in public, all in all, a pretty magical night.",5,Big Bang Theory,143,27
22893,Penny,9," Okay, I'm not innocent in all this, but you basically called me stupid, you asthmatic dumbass.",5,Big Bang Theory,95,16
22894,Leonard,9," I know, I, I, I crossed a line. And I'm sorry. No, no, no, hang on. I really mean it. And it's not like when we were going out, I'd just apologize for everything so we could end up in bed. This is a 100% sex-is-off-the-table I'm sorry.",5,Big Bang Theory,236,48
22895,Penny,9," All right. Thank you. I'm sorry, too.",5,Big Bang Theory,38,7
22896,Leonard,9," Just to be clear, sex is off the table, right?",5,Big Bang Theory,47,10
22897,Penny,9, Way off.,5,Big Bang Theory,9,2
22898,Leonard,9, Maybe we're not ready to hang out as friends.,5,Big Bang Theory,46,9
22899,Penny,9," I don't know. Up until the last part, I was kind of enjoying take-charge Leonard with a little backbone. Picking the movie, knowing what he wants, a little cocky.",5,Big Bang Theory,163,29
22900,Leonard,9, Really?,5,Big Bang Theory,8,1
22901,Penny,9, Yeah.,5,Big Bang Theory,6,1
22902,Leonard,9," Well, then, I'm putting sex back on the table. What do you think about that?",5,Big Bang Theory,77,15
22903,Penny,9, Ooh. Maybe I like it.,5,Big Bang Theory,22,5
22904,Leonard,9," You do? Because if that's what you like, I can be that guy. I swear, I'll be anything you want me to be.",5,Big Bang Theory,105,23
22905,Penny,9," Good night, Leonard.",5,Big Bang Theory,21,3
22906,Leonard,9, I am such an asthmatic dumbass. I had a weird night.,5,Big Bang Theory,53,11
22907,Sheldon,9, Mine was great. I'm going to be a mommy. ,5,Big Bang Theory,42,9
22909,Howard,10, It's amazing people keep coming to comic book stores instead of just downloading comics digitally.,5,Big Bang Theory,99,15
22910,Leonard,10," It's probably for the best. For a lot of these guys, the weekly trip here is the only chance their mom has to go down to the basement and change their sheets.",5,Big Bang Theory,159,32
22911,Howard,10," Oh, that reminds me, I get fresh sheets tonight. Yay.",5,Big Bang Theory,54,10
22912,Sheldon,10," Well? What do you think of New Comic Book Night? Magic, huh?",5,Big Bang Theory,61,12
22913,Amy,10," Sheldon, I'm disappointed. As a brilliant man, you're entitled to a vice. I could understand frequenting an opium den or hunting your fellow man for sport. But this? Lame-o.",5,Big Bang Theory,174,29
22914,Sheldon,10," Well, A, comic books employ storytelling through sequential art, a medium that dates back 17,000 years to the cave paintings of Lascaux, and B, you play the harp. Like that's cool.",5,Big Bang Theory,181,31
22916,Amy,10, A comic that depicts a woman whose bosom can't be used as a floatation device.,5,Big Bang Theory,79,15
22918,Raj,10," Hey, look, the new Warlords of Ka'a expansion pack is out.",5,Big Bang Theory,59,11
22919,Howard,10," A new one? Unbelievable. They just keep making up more cheesy monsters, slapping them on cards and selling them at 25 bucks a pop. It's like a secret tax on guys who can't get laid.",5,Big Bang Theory,182,35
22920,Raj,10," They're not even trying. Remember the Satanimals pack with the Hellephant? Why, absurd. What was he, a bad elephant who died and went to hell? What could an elephant possibly do that would cause him eternal damnation?",5,Big Bang Theory,218,37
22921,Howard,10, Wild West and Witches? What kind of loser cares about a showdown between Billy the Kid and the White Wizard of the North?,5,Big Bang Theory,122,23
22922,Raj,10, A total loser. Obviously a guy with a six-shooter beats an old man with a magic wand.,5,Big Bang Theory,86,17
22923,Leonard,10," Well, ho-hold on. What if the wizard casts a Helmet of Confusion spell on Billy the Kid's cowboy hat?",5,Big Bang Theory,102,19
22924,Howard,10," What? Please! This is Billy the Kid we're talking about. I mean, the wizard would get shot between the eyes before he could ever get out the words, what the hell is Billy the Kid doing in the mystic realm of Ka'a?",5,Big Bang Theory,214,42
22926,Leonard,10, Couple of weirdos. Why?,5,Big Bang Theory,24,4
22927,Howard,10, You interested in Amy?,5,Big Bang Theory,23,4
22929,Leonard,10, Sure. I guess.,5,Big Bang Theory,15,3
22930,Raj,10," Stuart, settle an argument for us. Who would win, Billy the Kid or the White Wizard?",5,Big Bang Theory,85,16
22932,Raj,10, I'll take one.,5,Big Bang Theory,15,3
22933,Howard,10," Mmm, make it two.",5,Big Bang Theory,18,4
22934,Leonard,10, I hate all of you and myself. Three.,5,Big Bang Theory,37,8
22937,Leonard,10," Hey, can I talk to you about something? It's a little awkward.",5,Big Bang Theory,63,12
22938,Sheldon,10," I know what this is about. Given the professional standstill you're at, you're wondering if this is the appropriate time to abandon your research and focus on teaching. Yes. And if I may suggest, consider changing disciplines. Yeah, to the humanities, perhaps history. One of the advantages of teaching history is that you don't have to create things, you know, you just have to remember stuff that happened and then parrot it back. You could have fun with that.",5,Big Bang Theory,463,79
22939,Leonard,10," Yeah, that's not it. Stuart's kind of interested in Amy.",5,Big Bang Theory,57,10
22940,Sheldon,10," Oh, of course he is. She's very interesting. Did you know, when she was 14, she severed the webbing between her own toes?",5,Big Bang Theory,122,23
22941,Leonard,10, No. He wanted me to find out if you'd have a problem with him asking her out.,5,Big Bang Theory,78,17
22942,Sheldon,10," I'm not sure how to respond, Leonard. I don't own Amy. Can't own a person. At least not since? 1863. President Lincoln freed the? Slaves! Come on Leonard, if you're going to teach history, these are the kind of facts you'll have to know.",5,Big Bang Theory,238,44
22943,Leonard,10, You know what? Never mind. I'm going to tell him it's okay to ask her out.,5,Big Bang Theory,75,16
22944,Sheldon,10," The question is moot. There is no way that Stuart, an impoverished peddler of picture books, would be at all appealing to Amy Farrah Fowler, a noted neurobiologist capable of performing surgery on her own feet with nothing but nitrous oxide from cans of whipped cream as anesthesia.",5,Big Bang Theory,283,48
22945,Leonard,10," All right, but just for the record, I checked in with you to see how you'd feel about it.",5,Big Bang Theory,90,19
22946,Sheldon,10," Fine. The record shall so reflect. Now, getting back to the problem at hand, what to do with a washed-up experimental physicist.",5,Big Bang Theory,129,22
22947,Leonard,10, I am not washed-up.,5,Big Bang Theory,20,4
22948,Sheldon,10," Oh, Leonard. Lots of people love you and want to help you, but they can't until you admit the problem.",5,Big Bang Theory,103,20
22950,Penny,10," Well, ladies, we killed the bottle.",5,Big Bang Theory,36,6
22951,Amy,10, I had half a glass.,5,Big Bang Theory,20,5
22953,Penny,10," Okay, don't judge me. So, what do you want to do, go to the movies, go dancing, lay down for a little bit?",5,Big Bang Theory,107,23
22954,Amy,10, Or we play Travel Twister.,5,Big Bang Theory,27,5
22956,Amy,10," Excuse me. I've passed many an enjoyable evening playing this game. And I'm sure it's a lot more exciting when you play with other people. What do you say, bestie? We can do shirts and skins. I'm shirts. Called it.",5,Big Bang Theory,215,40
22958,Penny,10," Hey, you know, my mom smoked pot when she was pregnant with me, and I turned out just fine. Hey, look, I have peach schnapps. Thank God.",5,Big Bang Theory,137,27
22959,Amy,10," Guys, something happened.",5,Big Bang Theory,26,3
22960,Penny,10, What's wrong?,5,Big Bang Theory,14,2
22961,Amy,10, I think a boy likes me.,5,Big Bang Theory,24,6
22963,Penny,10," Amy, little vixen. Just working it under all those layers of wool and polyester.",5,Big Bang Theory,81,14
22965,Penny,10," Oh, she doesn't have a boyfriend, she has a Sheldon. So do you like Stuart?",5,Big Bang Theory,76,15
22966,Amy,10," I don't know. He's nice. He's funny. He has the sallow, drawn countenance associated with an overactive thyroid gland. That's kind of hot.",5,Big Bang Theory,139,23
22967,Penny,10," Okay, look, sweetie, we all love Sheldon, but you've been with him over a year now. If it's not going anywhere, what does it hurt to look around?",5,Big Bang Theory,146,28
22969,Penny,10," Yeah, for what it's worth, engaged people can look around, too. Lot of options out there.",5,Big Bang Theory,90,16
22971,Sheldon,10, Where's Stuart?,5,Big Bang Theory,16,2
22973,Sheldon,10, Who are you?,5,Big Bang Theory,13,3
22975,Leonard,10, Really?,5,Big Bang Theory,8,1
22977,Leonard,10, I want to return this Wild West and Witches Ka'a expansion pack.,5,Big Bang Theory,65,12
22979,Leonard,10," Sure, sure. Uh, when will Stuart be back?",5,Big Bang Theory,42,8
22981,Sheldon,10," Oh, I guess I was wrong.",5,Big Bang Theory,25,6
22982,Leonard,10, You okay?,5,Big Bang Theory,10,2
22983,Sheldon,10," Am I okay? Leonard, I'm on a lifelong trajectory that includes a Nobel Prize and cities named after me, all four wisdom teeth fit comfortably in my mouth without need of extraction, and my bowel movements run like a German train schedule. Am I okay?",5,Big Bang Theory,250,45
22986,Raj,10, Wild Bill Witchcock.,5,Big Bang Theory,21,3
22987,Leonard,10, A tribe of Abra-Comanches.,5,Big Bang Theory,27,4
22988,Sheldon,10," Flaming Spittoon. And for the record, I'm very disappointed in you cowpokes. We're playing our inaugural round of Wild West and Witches, and I'm the only one who bothered to dress for the occasion.  Patooie.",5,Big Bang Theory,208,35
22989,Howard,10," We're not wearing cowboy hats, Sheldon. It looks ridiculous.",5,Big Bang Theory,61,9
22990,Sheldon,10," And I suppose my boots and spurs are ridiculous, too?",5,Big Bang Theory,54,10
22991,Leonard,10, Yeah.,5,Big Bang Theory,6,1
22992,Howard,10, Very.,5,Big Bang Theory,6,1
22993,Raj,10, Incredibly so.,5,Big Bang Theory,15,2
22994,Sheldon,10, Did it look ridiculous when we got the Satanimals pack and I dressed up as a Beelzebobcat?,5,Big Bang Theory,91,17
22995,Leonard,10, Yeah.,5,Big Bang Theory,6,1
22996,Howard,10, Very.,5,Big Bang Theory,6,1
22997,Raj,10, Incredibly so.,5,Big Bang Theory,15,2
22998,Sheldon,10," All right, fine. Let's just play.",5,Big Bang Theory,34,6
22999,Leonard,10, We should go easy on him. Amy's out with Stuart tonight.,5,Big Bang Theory,57,11
23000,Howard,10, Wait a minute. Are you telling me that Sheldon's patented blend of condescension and no sex isn't enough to hold on to a woman?,5,Big Bang Theory,128,24
23001,Sheldon,10," Cluck, cluck, cluck. What are we, ladies at a quilting bee? Or are we men playing a fantasy card game set in a magical frontier town?",5,Big Bang Theory,134,26
23002,Howard,10, Sorry. Creepy Tepee.,5,Big Bang Theory,21,3
23003,Raj,10, Annie Ogly.,5,Big Bang Theory,12,2
23004,Leonard,10, Hocus Pocus Pocahontas.,5,Big Bang Theory,24,3
23005,Sheldon,10," And may I point out it is the three of you who are obsessed with Stuart and Amy, not me. I think you need to ask yourselves who's really being ridiculous here. ",5,Big Bang Theory,161,32
23006,Leonard,10, It's you.,5,Big Bang Theory,10,2
23007,Howard,10, You are.,5,Big Bang Theory,9,2
23008,Raj,10, Totally you.,5,Big Bang Theory,13,2
23010,Raj,10," Hey, guys, check it out. The deluxe limited edition Wild West and Witches expansion pack in the signed and numbered collector's tin.",5,Big Bang Theory,133,22
23011,Leonard,10," Oh come on, no! We just bought the regular pack.",5,Big Bang Theory,49,10
23012,Howard,10," Ooh, a sheriff's badge.",5,Big Bang Theory,24,4
23013,Raj,10," Yeah, it's also a wand.",5,Big Bang Theory,24,5
23014,Leonard,10," With a hologram? Nice. Hey, do you see this?",5,Big Bang Theory,45,9
23015,Sheldon,10," I'm in the matrix, Leonard, I see everything.",5,Big Bang Theory,46,8
23016,Leonard,10, You've got to be kidding me. You friended Stuart on Facebook?,5,Big Bang Theory,62,11
23017,Howard,10, I thought you didn't like Facebook anymore.,5,Big Bang Theory,44,7
23018,Sheldon,10, Don't be silly. I'm a fan of anything that tries to replace actual human contact.,5,Big Bang Theory,82,15
23019,Raj,10, Please. You're looking at Facebook to find out how their date went.,5,Big Bang Theory,68,12
23020,Sheldon,10," Really? You think I care if a man, what, shared a pumpkin latte with a dynamite lady?",5,Big Bang Theory,86,17
23021,Raj,10, You're so full of it.,5,Big Bang Theory,22,5
23022,Sheldon,10, You are free to believe whatever you like. And unfriend Rajesh Koothrappali.,5,Big Bang Theory,77,12
23023,Raj,10, You unfriended me? Seriously?,5,Big Bang Theory,30,4
23024,Howard,10," Oh, yeah. Now he's gonna miss all those great updates like, I can't believe I waited this long to make my own potpourri.",5,Big Bang Theory,121,23
23025,Leonard,10," Sheldon, why don't you just acknowledge that you have feelings for Amy and you don't want her going out with other men?",5,Big Bang Theory,120,22
23026,Sheldon,10, And unfriend Leonard Hofstadter.,5,Big Bang Theory,33,4
23027,Howard,10," Here's a radical thought. Go old-school, challenge Stuart to a fight. I mean, nothing makes the ladies hotter than two skinny white guys swatting at each other with their eyes closed.",5,Big Bang Theory,184,31
23028,Sheldon,10, And unfriend Howard Wolowitz.,5,Big Bang Theory,30,4
23029,Leonard,10, That's all of us. Can I use the laptop?,5,Big Bang Theory,40,9
23030,Sheldon,10, Why?,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
23031,Leonard,10, I have to buy that stupid collector's tin.,5,Big Bang Theory,43,8
23033,Penny,10, Who do we love?,5,Big Bang Theory,16,4
23034,Sheldon,10, Penny. ,5,Big Bang Theory,8,1
23035,Penny,10, Who do we love?,5,Big Bang Theory,16,4
23036,Sheldon,10, Penny. ,5,Big Bang Theory,8,1
23037,Penny,10, Who do we love?,5,Big Bang Theory,16,4
23038,Sheldon,10, Penny.,5,Big Bang Theory,7,1
23039,Penny,10," Hello, Sheldon. Come on in.",5,Big Bang Theory,28,5
23040,Sheldon,10, Thank you.,5,Big Bang Theory,11,2
23041,Penny,10, What's up?,5,Big Bang Theory,11,2
23042,Sheldon,10, I came to ask if you would like to go on a date with me.,5,Big Bang Theory,57,15
23043,Penny,10," I'm sorry, what?",5,Big Bang Theory,17,3
23044,Sheldon,10," A date. You and me. Dining, dancing, perhaps you'd like to take in a prizefight.",5,Big Bang Theory,81,15
23045,Penny,10," God, are you trying to make Amy jealous?",5,Big Bang Theory,41,8
23046,Sheldon,10, No. Why is everyone so obsessed with Amy and Stuart? And whether or not they may be having more pumpkin lattes or intercourse tonight.,5,Big Bang Theory,135,24
23047,Penny,10," Okay, listen to me. Playing games is not gonna help get Amy back.",5,Big Bang Theory,66,13
23048,Sheldon,10," I am not trying to get her back. But, out of curiosity, what is a way?",5,Big Bang Theory,71,16
23049,Penny,10," All right, honey, let me tell you a story. There was a guy I liked, and I never told him how I felt. Eventually, he started going out with someone else, and I always regretted it. Do you see where I'm going with this?",5,Big Bang Theory,218,44
23050,Sheldon,10, I believe I do.,5,Big Bang Theory,16,4
23051,Penny,10, Mm.,5,Big Bang Theory,4,1
23052,Sheldon,10, I'm the guy.,5,Big Bang Theory,13,3
23053,Penny,10, You're not the guy.,5,Big Bang Theory,20,4
23054,Sheldon,10," Are you sure? That would explain so much. Your constant presence in my apartment, that baffling dalliance with Leonard just to be near me, the way you call me sweetie all the time.",5,Big Bang Theory,181,33
23055,Penny,10, I call everyone sweetie.,5,Big Bang Theory,25,4
23056,Sheldon,10, You tramp.,5,Big Bang Theory,11,2
23057,Penny,10," Look, Sheldon, all I'm saying is strap on a pair and go talk to Amy.",5,Big Bang Theory,69,15
23058,Sheldon,10," Strap on a pair? Of what, skates?",5,Big Bang Theory,34,7
23059,Penny,10," Oh, sweetie, you are so not the guy.",5,Big Bang Theory,37,8
23062,Amy,10," No, I'm having a nice time.",5,Big Bang Theory,28,6
23064,Sheldon,10," Excuse me. Excuse me. Pardon me. Pardon me. Excuse me. Hi, Stuart.",5,Big Bang Theory,67,12
23066,Sheldon,10, Pardon me. Excuse me.,5,Big Bang Theory,22,4
23067,Amy,10," Sheldon, what are you doing here?",5,Big Bang Theory,34,6
23068,Sheldon,10," The thought of you sitting in a darkened theatre with a character like Stuart is repellent. No offence, Stuart.",5,Big Bang Theory,112,19
23070,Amy,10," I'm sorry this causes you discomfort, but based on the currently established parameters of our relationship, I can put myself in any repellent situation I want.",5,Big Bang Theory,161,26
23072,Sheldon,10," Stuart, please. You're being rude.",5,Big Bang Theory,35,5
23073,Amy,10, Anything else?,5,Big Bang Theory,15,2
23074,Sheldon,10, I believe I would like to alter the paradigm of our relationship.,5,Big Bang Theory,66,12
23075,Amy,10, I'm listening.,5,Big Bang Theory,15,2
23076,Sheldon,10," With the understanding that nothing changes whatsoever, physical or otherwise, I would not object to us no longer characterizing you as not my girlfriend.",5,Big Bang Theory,155,24
23077,Amy,10, Interesting. Now try it without the quadruple negative.,5,Big Bang Theory,56,8
23078,Sheldon,10, You're being impossible.,5,Big Bang Theory,25,3
23079,Amy,10," Hi, Stuart.",5,Big Bang Theory,12,2
23080,Sheldon,10," Fine. Amy, will you be my girlfriend?",5,Big Bang Theory,38,7
23081,Amy,10, Yes.,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
23082,Sheldon,10," Well, that's enough of that. Sorry to interrupt. You two enjoy your date. Here's a dollar for your troubles. Get yourself some Sour Patch Kids.",5,Big Bang Theory,144,25
23085,Amy,10," Yes, well, thanks for seeing me to my door.",5,Big Bang Theory,44,9
23087,Sheldon,10,  Amy.  Amy.  Amy. Let's wrap things up out there.,5,Big Bang Theory,50,9
23088,Amy,10," Um, good night, Stuart.",5,Big Bang Theory,24,4
23090,Sheldon,10," Take the hint, Stuart. The lady said good night.",5,Big Bang Theory,49,9
23091,Amy,10, How did you get into my apartment?,5,Big Bang Theory,35,7
23092,Sheldon,10, Wow. Is that the kind of nagging I can expect now that you're my girlfriend? Good thing I drew this up.,5,Big Bang Theory,104,21
23093,Amy,10, What's that?,5,Big Bang Theory,13,2
23094,Sheldon,10," I present to you the relationship agreement. A binding covenant that, in its 31 pages, enumerates, iterates and codifies the rights and responsibilities of Sheldon Lee Cooper, here and after known as the boyfriend, and Amy Farrah Fowler, here and after known as the girlfriend.",5,Big Bang Theory,278,45
23095,Amy,10, It's so romantic.,5,Big Bang Theory,18,3
23096,Sheldon,10, Mutual indemnification always is. Why don't you start perusing while I set up my notary stamp.,5,Big Bang Theory,95,16
23097,Sheldon,10, Feel free to retain a lawyer.,5,Big Bang Theory,30,6
23099,Amy,10," Penny, I said right hand red.",5,Big Bang Theory,30,6
23100,Penny,10," Yeah, I heard you. I got red.",5,Big Bang Theory,30,7
23101,Amy,10," Bernadette, left foot yellow.",5,Big Bang Theory,30,4
23103,Sheldon,10,  Penny.  Amy.  Bernadette.,5,Big Bang Theory,27,3
23104,Amy,10, That's my boyfriend. It's open!,5,Big Bang Theory,32,5
23105,Sheldon,10, I got a splinter.,5,Big Bang Theory,18,4
23106,Amy,10, What do you want me to do about it?,5,Big Bang Theory,36,9
23107,Sheldon,10," Relationship agreement Section 4, Boo-boos and Ouchies. You have to take care of it.",5,Big Bang Theory,85,14
23108,Amy,10, I should've gotten a lawyer.,5,Big Bang Theory,29,5
23110,Penny,10, You should probably drive.,5,Big Bang Theory,27,4
23112,Penny,11, Hi. Did Sheldon change the Wi-Fi password again?,5,Big Bang Theory,49,8
23113,Leonard,11," Yeah, it's â€œPenny already eats our food, she can pay for Wi-Fi.â€ù No spaces.",5,Big Bang Theory,80,14
23114,Penny,11," Okay. If you can't get me to stop eating your food, what makes you think you can get me to stop using your Wi-Fi?",5,Big Bang Theory,114,24
23115,Sheldon,11, I believe that you're capable of great change. Like when I finally got you to stop saying Valentimes Day.,5,Big Bang Theory,106,19
23116,Leonard,11, You want to hear something weird?,5,Big Bang Theory,34,6
23117,Penny,11, Sure.,5,Big Bang Theory,6,1
23118,Sheldon,11," In the year 2000, Pope John Paul II was named an honorary Harlem Globetrotter.",5,Big Bang Theory,79,14
23119,Leonard,11, What are you talking about?,5,Big Bang Theory,28,5
23120,Sheldon,11, You asked Penny if she wanted to hear something weird.,5,Big Bang Theory,55,10
23121,Leonard,11," Yeah, because I have something weird to tell her.",5,Big Bang Theory,50,9
23122,Sheldon,11, Oh. I thought it was a game.,5,Big Bang Theory,29,7
23123,Penny,11, What's yours?,5,Big Bang Theory,14,2
23124,Leonard,11," There's this guy, Jimmy Speckerman, who used to torment me in high school. He sent me a message through Facebook. He's in town and wants to have drinks.",5,Big Bang Theory,153,28
23125,Sheldon,11," Okay, Penny, if it were a game, here are your choices. An e-mail from an old acquaintance, or the head of one of the largest religious institutions in the world slam dunking to Sweet Georgia Brown. Pick.",5,Big Bang Theory,204,37
23126,Leonard,11," Just do it, 'cause he's not gonna let it go.",5,Big Bang Theory,45,10
23127,Penny,11, Basketball Pope.,5,Big Bang Theory,17,2
23128,Sheldon,11, And that's how it's done.,5,Big Bang Theory,26,5
23129,Penny,11, What are you gonna do about your bully? Are you gonna see him?,5,Big Bang Theory,63,13
23130,Leonard,11, I don't know.,5,Big Bang Theory,14,3
23131,Sheldon,11, Is this the fellow who peed in your Hawaiian Punch?,5,Big Bang Theory,52,10
23132,Leonard,11," No, that was a different guy.",5,Big Bang Theory,30,6
23133,Sheldon,11," Was he the one who wedgied you so hard, your testicle reascended, and you spent your whole Christmas break waiting for it to come back down?",5,Big Bang Theory,141,26
23134,Leonard,11," No, that was a different, different guy.",5,Big Bang Theory,41,7
23135,Sheldon,11, Was he the one who used your head to open a nut?,5,Big Bang Theory,49,12
23136,Leonard,11, No.,5,Big Bang Theory,4,1
23137,Sheldon,11," Oh, oh, oh. Was he the one who made you eat your arm hair?",5,Big Bang Theory,59,14
23138,Leonard,11," No, but, actually, that was this guy's sister.",5,Big Bang Theory,47,8
23139,Penny,11," All right, well, what do you think he wants?",5,Big Bang Theory,45,9
23140,Leonard,11, I don't know.,5,Big Bang Theory,14,3
23141,Sheldon,11," You know, the holidays are just around the corner. Maybe he wants to see if he can lodge the other testicle up there.",5,Big Bang Theory,118,23
23142,Leonard,11, I told you. That was a different guy.,5,Big Bang Theory,38,8
23143,Penny,11, Hmm. That's too bad. We could have spent New Year's Eve waiting for the ball to drop.,5,Big Bang Theory,86,17
23145,Leonard,11, It's two a.m. What are you doing up?,5,Big Bang Theory,37,8
23146,Sheldon,11, Nobel Prize acceptance ceremony streaming live from Stockholm.,5,Big Bang Theory,63,8
23147,Leonard,11, Sure. You want to see what all the scientists are wearing this year.,5,Big Bang Theory,69,13
23148,Sheldon,11," Look at these men. They've managed to win the top science prize in the world with no more understanding of the quantum underpinnings of the expansion of the early universe than God gave a goose. You should pay attention, Leonard. Someday this could be you up there.",5,Big Bang Theory,266,47
23149,Leonard,11, Thanks.,5,Big Bang Theory,8,1
23150,Sheldon,11," So, what's got you up? Did you have a bad clam?",5,Big Bang Theory,48,11
23151,Leonard,11, I didn't have clams.,5,Big Bang Theory,21,4
23152,Sheldon,11, I don't watch you 24 hours a day. I don't know what you do.,5,Big Bang Theory,60,14
23153,Leonard,11," It's this Jimmy Speckerman thing. I can't decide if I should agree to see him or not. Of course that might be because the last time I ran into him, he made me floss with my own shoelaces.",5,Big Bang Theory,188,38
23154,Sheldon,11," Wear loafers. Look at Dr. Saul Perlmutter up there, clutching that Nobel Prize. What's the matter, Saul? You afraid someone's going to steal it? Like you stole Einstein's cosmological constant?",5,Big Bang Theory,194,30
23155,Leonard,11," You know what? I am tired of living in fear of this guy. I'm gonna go see him and finally say all the things I should have said in high school. You know, pick on someone your own size, you did not have sex with my mother, and yes, I do know why I'm hitting myself.â€ù",5,Big Bang Theory,268,56
23156,Sheldon,11," Oh, now Perlmutter's shaking the King's hand. Yeah, check for your watch, Gustaf. He might have lifted it.",5,Big Bang Theory,107,18
23159,Penny,11," â€˜Cause when I wear it, it's a shirt. So, what's Howard doing tonight?",5,Big Bang Theory,72,13
23161,Penny,11," Oh, terrific. High school quarterback against four mathletes.",5,Big Bang Theory,62,8
23162,Amy,11," When Leonard gets back, I'd love to check his serotonin levels. Do you think he'd let me draw a syringe full of his blood?",5,Big Bang Theory,123,24
23163,Penny,11," Hmm, he's not crazy about needles, but if you get him to go jogging, it'll just pour out of his nose.",5,Big Bang Theory,102,21
23165,Penny,11," Oh, that's awful.",5,Big Bang Theory,18,3
23167,Amy,11," That's nothing. In ninth grade, the girls put Rogaine in my hand lotion. Within six months, the nicknames began to fly. I think the one that hurt the most was Gorilla Fingers Fowler.",5,Big Bang Theory,183,33
23168,Penny,11, Wow. You poor thing.,5,Big Bang Theory,21,4
23170,Penny,11, Oh. I don't know. I guess my school was a nice place. We didn't really have bullies.,5,Big Bang Theory,85,17
23171,Amy,11," Come on, no one ever gave anyone mean nicknames or picked on them or put gum in their hairy knuckles so the school nurse had to use peanut butter to get it out?",5,Big Bang Theory,161,33
23172,Penny,11," No, we weren't really like that. I mean, look, we played pranks on each other, but it was never mean. Like, okay, this one girl, Kathy Geiger, got really good grades, so we blindfolded her, tied her up and left her in a cornfield overnight.",5,Big Bang Theory,241,45
23174,Penny,11," No, it was funny. Everyone laughed.",5,Big Bang Theory,36,6
23175,Amy,11, Did Kathy Geiger laugh?,5,Big Bang Theory,24,4
23176,Penny,11," Uh, probably. It's hard to say. She kind of had an ear of corn in her mouth.",5,Big Bang Theory,77,17
23177,Amy,11, Who would have thought Fuzzy Fingers Fowler is best friends with a bully?,5,Big Bang Theory,74,13
23178,Penny,11, What? I was not a bully.,5,Big Bang Theory,25,6
23180,Amy,11, Shh. That's how you wind up in a cornfield.,5,Big Bang Theory,44,9
23182,Raj,11, Is that him over there?,5,Big Bang Theory,24,5
23183,Leonard,11, No.,5,Big Bang Theory,4,1
23184,Raj,11, How about that guy? He looks like he'd hate you.,5,Big Bang Theory,49,10
23185,Leonard,11," You know, I can really do this by myself.",5,Big Bang Theory,42,9
23186,Howard,11," Hey, we're here to support you, buddy.",5,Big Bang Theory,39,7
23187,Leonard,11," No, you're not. You're here to see if I get my underwear pulled over my head.",5,Big Bang Theory,78,16
23188,Howard,11, You wore underwear? You fool.,5,Big Bang Theory,30,5
23189,Raj,11," So, have you figured out what you're going to say to him?",5,Big Bang Theory,58,12
23190,Leonard,11, You bet. I am going to make him apologize for all the crap he pulled on me in school.,5,Big Bang Theory,86,19
23191,Howard,11," That's quite a list. I can't read your handwriting, what's that word?",5,Big Bang Theory,70,12
23192,Leonard,11, Scrotum.,5,Big Bang Theory,9,1
23193,Raj,11, What's that one?,5,Big Bang Theory,17,3
23194,Leonard,11," Uh, stapled.",5,Big Bang Theory,13,2
23196,Leonard,11," Oh, hi.",5,Big Bang Theory,8,2
23198,Leonard,11," Yeah. You, too. Uh, Jimmy, this is Sheldon and Raj and Howard.",5,Big Bang Theory,63,12
23200,Sheldon,11, And there's the first zinger. Ouch.,5,Big Bang Theory,36,6
23201,Leonard,11," I'm doing okay, I guess.",5,Big Bang Theory,25,5
23203,Leonard,11, The Newcomb medal.,5,Big Bang Theory,19,3
23205,Sheldon,11," Congratulations? The Newcomb medal? Oh, please. That's the scientific equivalent of a smiley face sticker on your homework.",5,Big Bang Theory,124,18
23207,Sheldon,11," Oh, good Lord, are we going to stand here and listen to him tear Leonard apart like this?",5,Big Bang Theory,90,18
23208,Raj,11," Hey, I won a Newcomb medal, too.",5,Big Bang Theory,33,7
23209,Sheldon,11, My point.,5,Big Bang Theory,10,2
23211,Leonard,11," Oh, I can't take all the credit. You helped a lot.",5,Big Bang Theory,51,11
23213,Howard,11, Like the Black Death and Europe.,5,Big Bang Theory,33,6
23214,Leonard,11," Jimmy, I'm kind of curious why you wanted to see me.",5,Big Bang Theory,53,11
23216,Sheldon,11," Technically, Howard's the gear head. Leonard's just a dime store laser jockey.",5,Big Bang Theory,79,12
23217,Leonard,11, What's the idea?,5,Big Bang Theory,17,3
23219,Leonard,11, Right.,5,Big Bang Theory,7,1
23221,Raj,11," That sounds amazing. First movie I'm watching, Annie.",5,Big Bang Theory,54,8
23222,Howard,11, How exactly would these glasses work?,5,Big Bang Theory,38,6
23224,Leonard,11, I don't think something like that's even possible.,5,Big Bang Theory,51,8
23226,Sheldon,11," The smartest? All right, you know, I may not have a firm grasp on sarcasm, but even I know that was a doozy. Leonard, you can't live in fear of this man forever.",5,Big Bang Theory,162,33
23227,Leonard,11," Sheldon, I got this.",5,Big Bang Theory,21,4
23228,Sheldon,11," You clearly don't. What my spineless friend lacks the courage to say is you're a terrible person who took advantage of his tiny size, his uncoordinated nature and his congenital lack of masculinity.",5,Big Bang Theory,199,33
23229,Leonard,11, Sheldon.,5,Big Bang Theory,9,1
23230,Sheldon,11," Leonard, I platonically love you, man, but face it, you're a mess.",5,Big Bang Theory,67,12
23232,Leonard,11, I think what he's trying to say is that maybe in high school you picked on me a little bit.,5,Big Bang Theory,92,20
23233,Sheldon,11, A little bit? The man Super Glued Hershey's Kisses to your nipples.,5,Big Bang Theory,68,12
23234,Raj,11, That's funny because those aren't the kind of kisses you want on your nipples.,5,Big Bang Theory,79,14
23236,Sheldon,11, This is a list of your heinous acts against Leonard. One of which is certainly the cause of him wetting his bed well into his teens.,5,Big Bang Theory,133,26
23237,Leonard,11," 14 is not, oh , yeah, never mind.",5,Big Bang Theory,34,8
23239,Leonard,11, Nancy. You called me Nancy for three years.,5,Big Bang Theory,44,8
23240,Sheldon,11, You really need to work on your penmanship.,5,Big Bang Theory,44,8
23242,Leonard,11, It wasn't fun for me.,5,Big Bang Theory,22,5
23243,Sheldon,11," You're being too kind, Leonard. You ruined him.",5,Big Bang Theory,48,8
23244,Leonard,11," Come on, guys.",5,Big Bang Theory,15,3
23245,Raj,11," That was pretty badass, dude.",5,Big Bang Theory,30,5
23246,Sheldon,11, I help the weak. It's yet another way I'm exactly like Batman.,5,Big Bang Theory,63,12
23247,Leonard,11," Hey, for the record, Jimmy wasn't the reason I wet the bed. That one has my mother written all over it.",5,Big Bang Theory,104,21
23249,Penny,11," Anyway, I'm really sorry I made fun of your stutter in high school.",5,Big Bang Theory,68,13
23251,Penny,11," Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Oh, God, just finish the sentence. Okay, well, I'm sorry you feel that way. Bye. No one wants to hear my apologies.",5,Big Bang Theory,132,24
23252,Amy,11," I think your mistake is doing it over the phone. If they could look into your eyes, they'd melt.",5,Big Bang Theory,97,19
23254,Penny,11, That's easy for you to say. You weren't just called a b-b-b-b-bitch.,5,Big Bang Theory,69,12
23255,Amy,11, Perhaps you could assuage your guilt through altruism. Which word's tripping you up? Assuage or altruism?,5,Big Bang Theory,106,16
23256,Penny,11, Both.,5,Big Bang Theory,6,1
23258,Penny,11, I actually knew that.,5,Big Bang Theory,22,4
23259,Amy,11, I never doubted you.,5,Big Bang Theory,21,4
23261,Penny,11," Ooh, I can't do that. If I stand over a steaming pot, my hair just goes boing! What else could I do?",5,Big Bang Theory,101,22
23262,Amy,11," There's Habitat for Humanity, building houses for the poor.",5,Big Bang Theory,60,9
23263,Penny,11," Okay, come on, I don't even have my own house, I'm going to build one for someone else?",5,Big Bang Theory,88,18
23264,Amy,11, How about donating some of your clothes?,5,Big Bang Theory,41,7
23265,Penny,11," Oh, my God, that's perfect. â€˜Cause I have so many clothes I don't wear, and they're just taking up space, and I go shopping to buy more stuff and I have no place to put it. This will totally fix that.",5,Big Bang Theory,203,41
23267,Penny,11, And helping people.,5,Big Bang Theory,20,3
23269,Leonard,11, Here's your cocoa.,5,Big Bang Theory,19,3
23270,Sheldon,11," Oh, half and half instead of whole milk?",5,Big Bang Theory,41,8
23271,Leonard,11, Yes.,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
23272,Sheldon,11, Heated to precisely 183 degrees?,5,Big Bang Theory,33,5
23273,Leonard,11, Yes.,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
23274,Sheldon,11," Seven little marshmallows, no more no less?",5,Big Bang Theory,44,7
23275,Leonard,11, You got one for good luck.  I'll get it.,5,Big Bang Theory,41,9
23276,Sheldon,11, One for good luck. Must be the kind of math they do at Princeton.,5,Big Bang Theory,66,14
23278,Leonard,11, What are you doing here?,5,Big Bang Theory,25,5
23280,Leonard,11, Laxative.,5,Big Bang Theory,10,1
23282,Leonard,11, Really?,5,Big Bang Theory,8,1
23284,Leonard,11," Uh, yeah. Sure, I guess.",5,Big Bang Theory,25,5
23286,Leonard,11," Well, yeah, thanks, Jimmy.",5,Big Bang Theory,27,4
23288,Leonard,11, Are you okay to drive?,5,Big Bang Theory,23,5
23290,Leonard,11," No, no, no, come on in. I'll make you a cup of coffee.",5,Big Bang Theory,55,13
23292,Leonard,11, No.,5,Big Bang Theory,4,1
23293,Sheldon,11, Yes.,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
23294,Leonard,11," Sheldon, we can't let him drive.",5,Big Bang Theory,33,6
23295,Sheldon,11, Then take away his keys and make him wander the streets with the other drunks.,5,Big Bang Theory,79,15
23296,Leonard,11, You remember Sheldon and Raj and Howard.,5,Big Bang Theory,41,7
23298,Sheldon,11, You'd think a winner could make a decent cup of cocoa.,5,Big Bang Theory,55,11
23300,Leonard,11," Yeah, just back there.",5,Big Bang Theory,23,4
23301,Howard,11," How about that? After all these years, your big bad high school bully finally apologizes.",5,Big Bang Theory,90,15
23302,Leonard,11, Yeah. It kind of rekindles your faith in the basic goodness of people.,5,Big Bang Theory,71,13
23303,Sheldon,11, You know what would be nice?,5,Big Bang Theory,29,6
23304,Raj,11, What's that?,5,Big Bang Theory,13,2
23305,Sheldon,11," As a symbolic gesture to all the bullies who've tormented us for years, we open our home to Jimmy and once he's asleep we kill him. I said it would be nice, I didn't say we should do it.",5,Big Bang Theory,187,39
23307,Penny,11," Ah, I feel just like Mother Teresa. Except for the virgin part. That ship sailed a long time ago.",5,Big Bang Theory,98,19
23309,Penny,11," Yeah, well, I bet her laundry room wasn't down five flights of stairs. You know, giving really is better than receiving. I used to think it was such a cliche, but it seems to be the oh, look at these cute jeans someone just threw away.",5,Big Bang Theory,236,46
23311,Penny,11," Yes, to a poor waitress who loves a boot cut.",5,Big Bang Theory,46,10
23313,Penny,11," Come on, they would be so cute on me, and, ah, they go great with this sweater!",5,Big Bang Theory,80,17
23314,Amy,11," I don't think Mother Teresa Oh, that is adorable.",5,Big Bang Theory,50,9
23316,Sheldon,11, Leonard.,5,Big Bang Theory,9,1
23317,Leonard,11, Yeah.,5,Big Bang Theory,6,1
23318,Sheldon,11," In case it comes up again, this right here is an imposition.",5,Big Bang Theory,61,12
23319,Leonard,11, What was I supposed to do? He needed a place to sleep it off.,5,Big Bang Theory,62,14
23320,Sheldon,11, You're soft. This world's going to chew you up and spit you out.,5,Big Bang Theory,65,13
23322,Leonard,11," Morning, Jimmy.",5,Big Bang Theory,16,2
23323,Sheldon,11," Oh, there it is, tacos.",5,Big Bang Theory,24,5
23325,Leonard,11," Yeah, you did. So, uh, listen, it was great to see you again. And , and, and thanks for the apology.",5,Big Bang Theory,101,21
23327,Leonard,11, For all the crappy stuff you did to me in high school.,5,Big Bang Theory,55,12
23329,Leonard,11, That's my French toast.,5,Big Bang Theory,24,4
23331,Sheldon,11," I'm not going to say I told you so, but we could have killed him.",5,Big Bang Theory,66,15
23332,Leonard,11, I might kill him right now.,5,Big Bang Theory,28,6
23333,Sheldon,11," The Dark Knight has your back. He's scared, but he has your back.",5,Big Bang Theory,66,13
23334,Leonard,11," Okay, Jimmy, it's time for you to go.",5,Big Bang Theory,38,8
23336,Leonard,11," No, you're done. I want you out of my apartment right now.",5,Big Bang Theory,59,12
23337,Sheldon,11," Well said, Boy Wonder.",5,Big Bang Theory,23,4
23339,Sheldon,11, Don't answer that. It's a trick question. I speak from experience.,5,Big Bang Theory,67,11
23340,Leonard,11," I'm not afraid of you any more, Jimmy. Now get out!  Uh-oh.",5,Big Bang Theory,60,12
23342,Sheldon,11," You did it, Leonard, you stood up to your bully.",5,Big Bang Theory,49,10
23343,Leonard,11," Yeah, I feel pretty good about myself. You think we can outrun him?",5,Big Bang Theory,68,13
23344,Sheldon,11," I don't need to outrun him, I just need to outrun you.",5,Big Bang Theory,55,12
23347,Penny,11, Then sit in the car and keep it running.,5,Big Bang Theory,41,9
23348,Amy,11," You were right, a whole new load.",5,Big Bang Theory,34,7
23349,Penny,11," Come on, yoga top. Mama needs a new yoga top.",5,Big Bang Theory,46,10
23350,Amy,11," Check it out, Bernadette, suede boots, your size.",5,Big Bang Theory,50,8
23352,Penny,11," Wait, wait, wait, guys, just hang on.",5,Big Bang Theory,38,7
23353,Amy,11," What is it, the fuzz?",5,Big Bang Theory,22,5
23354,Penny,11, Look at us. What are we doing?,5,Big Bang Theory,31,7
23355,Amy,11," I was gleefully following you to a life of crime, looking forward to the day we might be cell mates. I don't know about Bernadette.",5,Big Bang Theory,132,25
23356,Penny,11," You know, this is wrong. Let's put everything back. Here.",5,Big Bang Theory,58,10
23359,Howard,12, Completely empty box. If you'd like to examine it?,5,Big Bang Theory,51,9
23360,Leonard,12, Mm-hmm. Yep. I see nothing in this box but a wasted childhood.,5,Big Bang Theory,63,12
23361,Howard,12," Little snarky there, cello lessons. And we have this completely ordinary cylinder. If you'd like to examine it?",5,Big Bang Theory,112,18
23362,Raj,12," Ordinary, yet I sense it is dripping with magical potential.",5,Big Bang Theory,61,10
23363,Sheldon,12," Oh, dear Lord. A man pops out for a moment to evacuate his bowels and catch up on the adventures of the Caped Crusader, only to emerge and discover his apartment has been transformed into a cabaret.",5,Big Bang Theory,199,37
23364,Leonard,12," Sheldon, he's just practising for his cousin's birthday party.",5,Big Bang Theory,63,9
23365,Howard,12," As I was saying, empty box, empty cylinder, and, ooh, voila. ",5,Big Bang Theory,62,11
23366,Raj,12," I'm telling you, dude, there's a seat on the Hogwarts Express with your name on it.",5,Big Bang Theory,84,16
23367,Sheldon,12, This is how you're going to entertain your little cousin and his friends? By lying to them?,5,Big Bang Theory,92,17
23368,Howard,12, How is this lying?,5,Big Bang Theory,19,4
23369,Sheldon,12, A magic show is an inherently deceitful proposition. This is an ordinary top hat. You've chosen that card freely. I do not have a set of lock picks lodged in my keister.,5,Big Bang Theory,170,32
23370,Raj,12," Can't you just enjoy the wonder, Sheldon? Why must you peek behind the curtain? Or up the butt?",5,Big Bang Theory,96,18
23371,Sheldon,12," If we poison the critical thinking faculties of children by telling them that rabbits come out of hats, then we create adults who believe in astrology and homeopathy and that Ryan Reynolds was a better choice for Green Lantern than lovable rogue Nathan Fillion.",5,Big Bang Theory,262,44
23372,Leonard,12," Sheldon, he's just gonna do a few magic tricks for some kids. I really don't think they're gonna end up liking the Green Lantern movie.",5,Big Bang Theory,136,25
23373,Howard,12, Don't be so hard on him. It's natural to be a little cranky when you have a quarter in your ear!,5,Big Bang Theory,97,21
23374,Sheldon,12," Coins lodged in body parts is not a source of amusement. When I was five, Billy Sparks put a Mexican peso up my nose.",5,Big Bang Theory,118,24
23375,Howard,12, How is that not amusing?,5,Big Bang Theory,25,5
23376,Sheldon,12, It's still there. Takes me 45 minutes to get through airport security. ,5,Big Bang Theory,72,12
23377,Howard,12," Look, I made Sheldon disappear. Ta-da.",5,Big Bang Theory,39,6
23378,Leonard,12," Next time, you should open with that.",5,Big Bang Theory,38,7
23380,Penny,12," Ooh, look who's out on a date. Pasadena's favourite power couple, Shamy.",5,Big Bang Theory,73,12
23381,Sheldon,12," And that is the answer to the question, what is wrong with eating at The Cheesecake Factory?",5,Big Bang Theory,93,17
23382,Penny,12," So, are we celebrating anything special tonight?",5,Big Bang Theory,49,7
23383,Amy,12," Oh, yes. Our relationship agreement specifies that the second Thursday of every month, or the third Thursday in a month with five Thursdays, is date night.",5,Big Bang Theory,156,26
23384,Penny,12, That is so hot.,5,Big Bang Theory,16,4
23385,Sheldon,12," All right, without objection, the minutes of the previous date are considered read and agreed to. Any new business?",5,Big Bang Theory,116,19
23386,Amy,12, How was your day?,5,Big Bang Theory,18,4
23387,Sheldon,12," Superb. This morning I made a palindrome with my Alpha-Bits. Nice hat, Bob Tahecin.",5,Big Bang Theory,84,14
23388,Amy,12, Sounds like you hit the ground running. I have a bit of good news myself. My most recent paper on how a cooperative long-term potentiation can map memory sequences in dendritic branches made the cover of Neuron.,5,Big Bang Theory,212,37
23389,Sheldon,12," Ooh! Speaking of good news, somebody just hit 100 Twitter followers.",5,Big Bang Theory,69,11
23390,Amy,12," That's nice. Anyway, I've been dreaming of this day for a long time.",5,Big Bang Theory,69,13
23391,Sheldon,12," Yeah, me, too. Triple digits, I'm not gonna lie, feels pretty good.",5,Big Bang Theory,68,12
23392,Amy,12," Sheldon, I'm the sole author on a paper being published in a distinguished journal that may change the course of my field.",5,Big Bang Theory,123,22
23393,Sheldon,12," Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Ooh, 101! Air's getting a bit thin up here.",5,Big Bang Theory,60,11
23394,Penny,12," So, are we ready to order?",5,Big Bang Theory,27,6
23395,Amy,12, Give me a minute. I'm gonna go wash up.,5,Big Bang Theory,40,9
23396,Sheldon,12," Well, that's odd. We both washed up when we came in. It's probably a euphemism for urination.",5,Big Bang Theory,94,17
23397,Penny,12," Sheldon, what is wrong with you?",5,Big Bang Theory,33,6
23398,Sheldon,12," Not much. Although, I can be faulted for being overly fond of koala bears. I don't know what it is, when they smart munching on eucalyptus, I just melt inside.",5,Big Bang Theory,160,30
23399,Penny,12," Okay, Amy just told you some exciting news, and you acted like it was no big deal.",5,Big Bang Theory,83,17
23400,Sheldon,12," Oh, I see why you're confused. No, her news sounded important, but what you're forgetting is, it was an achievement in the field of biology. That's all about yucky, squishy things.",5,Big Bang Theory,181,31
23401,Penny,12," Honey, she's upset. You're her boyfriend. You have to at least try to be excited by the things she's excited by.",5,Big Bang Theory,113,21
23402,Sheldon,12, What if they simply don't excite me?,5,Big Bang Theory,37,7
23403,Penny,12," Well, just smile and think about koalas.",5,Big Bang Theory,41,7
23404,Sheldon,12," She'd see right through that. We go to the zoo all the time. She knows my koala face. And for future reference, it's this.",5,Big Bang Theory,123,24
23407,Howard,12, Yeah. I started when I was a teenager. I thought I could show a girl a few tricks and invite her up to my bedroom to see the rest of the act.,5,Big Bang Theory,142,32
23409,Howard,12," Ah, let's just say the only wand that ever saw any action was this one. Oh, look what my mom made us for the act.",5,Big Bang Theory,114,25
23411,Howard,12," Well, she cut up one of her old bathing suits. She made these two vests and half a dozen napkins.",5,Big Bang Theory,98,20
23413,Howard,12, I just gave it to her!,5,Big Bang Theory,23,6
23415,Howard,12," She's not stacked like you, Ma! She never steps on hers!",5,Big Bang Theory,57,11
23417,Howard,12, You'll do fine. Hand me those rings? See? You nailed it.,5,Big Bang Theory,57,11
23419,Howard,12," Well, that's because you haven't been around them much. This is good practice. I mean, you are gonna be a mom someday, right?",5,Big Bang Theory,126,23
23421,Howard,12," Oh-ho-ho! I haven't seen this trick in years. It's called the dove pan. You let everyone see the pan is empty, but there's a secret compartment in the lid. And then you open it and produce a live Don't look in there.",5,Big Bang Theory,217,42
23423,Leonard,12," Oh, a little Red Dead Redemption, huh?",5,Big Bang Theory,39,7
23424,Sheldon,12, Yes.,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
23425,Leonard,12, How come you're not doing a mission? You're just wandering around.,5,Big Bang Theory,67,11
23426,Sheldon,12, Had a rough night. I thought I'd go for a walk and clear my head.,5,Big Bang Theory,66,15
23427,Leonard,12, Some people go outside and do that.,5,Big Bang Theory,36,7
23428,Sheldon,12," It's after nine o'clock, at this hour the streets of Pasadena are teeming with drunken sailors and alley cats.",5,Big Bang Theory,111,19
23429,Leonard,12, You want to talk about it?,5,Big Bang Theory,27,6
23430,Sheldon,12, No. I think I'll just go in this saloon and drink my troubles away.,5,Big Bang Theory,68,14
23431,Leonard,12, You know digital alcohol is never a solution. What's going on?,5,Big Bang Theory,63,11
23432,Sheldon,12," Hard as this may be to believe, it's possible that I'm not boyfriend material.",5,Big Bang Theory,79,14
23433,Leonard,12, Glad I was sitting down for that. Did you and Amy get in a fight?,5,Big Bang Theory,66,15
23434,Sheldon,12, Amy had a fight. I was being perfectly reasonable. I'm gonna have a whiskey. Do you want anything?,5,Big Bang Theory,99,18
23435,Leonard,12," No, I can't. I'm playing Grand Theft Auto later. Look, I'm no expert in women.",5,Big Bang Theory,79,15
23436,Sheldon,12, I'll say.,5,Big Bang Theory,10,2
23437,Leonard,12, That's not necessary when someone's trying to help you.,5,Big Bang Theory,56,9
23438,Sheldon,12, I'm sorry. It's the alcohol talking. Go on.,5,Big Bang Theory,44,8
23439,Leonard,12, Sometimes with women you want to listen to what upsets them and then show them that you can grow and change.,5,Big Bang Theory,109,21
23440,Sheldon,12, Nuts to that. What else you got?,5,Big Bang Theory,33,7
23441,Leonard,12, I don't know what to tell you. Buy her something.,5,Big Bang Theory,50,10
23442,Sheldon,12, How does that work?,5,Big Bang Theory,20,4
23443,Leonard,12," Well, you skip over any attempt to repair your emotional connection and you win back her affection with an empty financial gesture.",5,Big Bang Theory,132,22
23444,Sheldon,12," Well, that approach has Sheldon Cooper written all over it.",5,Big Bang Theory,60,10
23445,Leonard,12, Glad I could help.,5,Big Bang Theory,19,4
23446,Sheldon,12," It's appreciated. And if you ever manage to find a woman again, I'll be glad to return the favour.",5,Big Bang Theory,99,19
23448,Howard,12," And now, all the rings are magically linked together. My fiancee's wearing a magic ring, too. It made all my money disappear.",5,Big Bang Theory,126,22
23454,Howard,12," Okay. Okay. Now, my lovely assistant is going to bring me an ordinary pitcher of milk.",5,Big Bang Theory,87,16
23457,Howard,12," Okay, we're going to roll up this newspaper.",5,Big Bang Theory,45,8
23460,Howard,12," Okay, we're going to stick this in here  and then I'm going to pour in the milk. I hope this works, because I didn't bring a change of pants.",5,Big Bang Theory,142,29
23463,Howard,12," She's just kidding, boys and girls. Everyone gets cake.",5,Big Bang Theory,56,9
23465,Howard,12, Just give me the pitcher. Behold! Wrong pitcher.,5,Big Bang Theory,49,8
23468,Howard,12," Yes, you did. Oh, I think my crotch is starting to curdle.",5,Big Bang Theory,59,12
23470,Howard,12," Yeah, so?",5,Big Bang Theory,10,2
23472,Howard,12," All right, settle down. Red light. Red light, red light! Okay, we're fine.",5,Big Bang Theory,75,13
23474,Howard,12," Yeah, no, we all got that. But don't you think it'll be different when the child is ours?",5,Big Bang Theory,90,18
23476,Howard,12," Well, yeah.",5,Big Bang Theory,12,2
23478,Sheldon,12, I don't think there's anything in this jewellery store that Amy would appreciate more than the humidifier we were just looking at at Sears.,5,Big Bang Theory,140,24
23479,Penny,12," Oh, my God, now I know what I sound like to you when I say stupid stuff.",5,Big Bang Theory,73,17
23480,Sheldon,12," Ooh, a pocket watch.",5,Big Bang Theory,21,4
23481,Penny,12," Okay, I don't think Amy wants a pocket watch.",5,Big Bang Theory,46,9
23482,Sheldon,12," No, but maybe she wants a man with a pocket watch.",5,Big Bang Theory,51,11
23483,Penny,12," Still saying stupid stuff. Ooh, does she like bracelets?",5,Big Bang Theory,57,9
23484,Sheldon,12," Well, she's very fond of her silver one that says allergic to penicillin. Maybe they have a dressier version of that?",5,Big Bang Theory,118,21
23486,Penny,12,"  Trust me, we are not a couple.",5,Big Bang Theory,32,7
23487,Sheldon,12, Excuse me. I don't see why you get to snort derisively and point that out. You'd be lucky to land a fella like me.,5,Big Bang Theory,115,24
23488,Penny,12," Fine, go ahead.",5,Big Bang Theory,16,3
23489,Sheldon,12,"  Trust me, we are not a couple.",5,Big Bang Theory,32,7
23491,Penny,12, He's in trouble with his girlfriend and needs to buy her a present.,5,Big Bang Theory,68,13
23493,Penny,12," Ooh, are these real diamonds?",5,Big Bang Theory,30,5
23495,Sheldon,12," Remarkable. Diamonds, crystallized carbon. Every day, people go to the grocery store and come home with sacks full of carbon in the form of charcoal briquettes that they toss in their barbeques and set on fire. But just because you've got some carbon with the atoms stacked neatly, you expect me to plunk down thousands of dollars.",5,Big Bang Theory,332,57
23497,Sheldon,12, Really. Talk to me about that pocket watch.,5,Big Bang Theory,44,8
23499,Howard,12, I'm still trying to wrap my mind around it. I always thought I'd be a dad someday.,5,Big Bang Theory,83,17
23500,Raj,12," Oh, me, too. You're so caring. I've often pictured you guiding a young boy into manhood.",5,Big Bang Theory,89,16
23501,Leonard,12," There you go, Howard. Sounds like Raj'll have your babies, problem solved.",5,Big Bang Theory,75,12
23502,Raj,12," Hey, just because a man shows caring for another man doesn't mean he's displaying the love that dare not speak its name. Did she definitely say she didn't want kids?",5,Big Bang Theory,166,30
23503,Howard,12," Yeah, she doesn't like them. And from what I saw, the feeling was mutual.",5,Big Bang Theory,74,14
23504,Leonard,12, What are you gonna do?,5,Big Bang Theory,23,5
23505,Howard,12," I don't know. I can't see a life where I don't have kids. I mean, people have kids. I mean, even Donkey Kong had Donkey Kong Jr. So he could teach someone how to kidnap princesses and throw barrels at Italian plumbers.",5,Big Bang Theory,219,42
23506,Leonard,12," You know, there's no guarantee even if you have kids that you're going to like them.",5,Big Bang Theory,85,16
23507,Raj,12," Wow, that's rough. Where'd you get that?",5,Big Bang Theory,41,7
23508,Leonard,12, It's right off the dust jacket of my mom's last book.,5,Big Bang Theory,54,11
23509,Howard,12, Maybe me and Bernadette aren't right for each other.,5,Big Bang Theory,53,9
23510,Leonard,12," Look, Howard, I'd say there's a lot of fish in the sea, but I watched you dangle your hook in the water for years. Do not throw her back.",5,Big Bang Theory,138,29
23511,Howard,12," I don't want to, but this is kind of a deal breaker.",5,Big Bang Theory,53,12
23512,Raj,12, What's your mom going to say if you call off the wedding?,5,Big Bang Theory,58,12
23513,Howard,12," Huh, it'll kill her. On the other hand, if I don't give her grandchildren, that'll kill her, too. So, either way, on the Mom front, I'm golden.",5,Big Bang Theory,144,27
23515,Sheldon,12, What time did you tell Amy to be here?,5,Big Bang Theory,39,9
23516,Penny,12," Eight o'clock.  Sheldon, that pocket watch is ridiculous.",5,Big Bang Theory,58,8
23517,Sheldon,12, Nonsense. I look like a train conductor. Under what pretext did you lure her here?,5,Big Bang Theory,83,15
23518,Penny,12," I said, hey, want to come over and hang out?",5,Big Bang Theory,45,10
23519,Sheldon,12," Good, good, if you had said something clever, she might've gotten suspicious.",5,Big Bang Theory,78,12
23520,Amy,12, Hey.,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
23521,Penny,12, Hi.,5,Big Bang Theory,4,1
23522,Amy,12, What's he doing here?,5,Big Bang Theory,22,4
23523,Penny,12," Okay, he wants to talk to you.",5,Big Bang Theory,31,7
23524,Amy,12," Well, I don't want to talk to him. And I'm pretty disappointed in you, too. Although we both know that won't last.",5,Big Bang Theory,115,22
23525,Penny,12," Sheldon, you're up.",5,Big Bang Theory,20,3
23526,Sheldon,12," Thank you. Amy, I'd like to apologize. Your accomplishment was impressive. And I'm proud of you.",5,Big Bang Theory,97,16
23527,Amy,12, We both know that's your koala face.,5,Big Bang Theory,37,7
23528,Sheldon,12, I told you.,5,Big Bang Theory,12,3
23529,Penny,12," Okay, look, he bought you this.",5,Big Bang Theory,32,6
23530,Amy,12," Jewellery? Seriously? Sheldon, you are the most shallow, self-centred person I have ever met. Do you really think another transparently manip..oh! It's a tiara! A tiara! I have a tiara! Put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me.",5,Big Bang Theory,284,58
23531,Penny,12, You look beautiful.,5,Big Bang Theory,20,3
23532,Amy,12," Of course I do, I'm a princess, and this is my tiara!",5,Big Bang Theory,54,12
23533,Sheldon,12," You're right, the tiara was too much.",5,Big Bang Theory,38,7
23537,Howard,12, You should keep it. You could wear it again sometime.,5,Big Bang Theory,54,10
23539,Howard,12," I don't know, hunting?",5,Big Bang Theory,23,4
23541,Howard,12," Don't worry, Ma. I will, as soon as I can figure out a way to bring up such a sensitive issue!",5,Big Bang Theory,95,21
23543,Howard,12," I was upset. My mom can be a pretty good shoulder to cry on, if the smell of Bengay doesn't burn your eyes.",5,Big Bang Theory,108,23
23545,Howard,12, Really? That's great. What?,5,Big Bang Theory,28,4
23547,Howard,12, Me?,5,Big Bang Theory,4,1
23549,Howard,12, Yeah.,5,Big Bang Theory,6,1
23551,Howard,12," Yeah, we're good.",5,Big Bang Theory,18,3
23553,Howard,12," I would love that. But what is that behind your ear? Oh, look, it's a condom.",5,Big Bang Theory,78,16
23555,Leonard,13," You feel like trying something new for dinner? Maybe Indian, Tex-Mex?",5,Big Bang Theory,70,11
23556,Sheldon,13, You ever wonder how humans would be different if they evolved from lizards instead of mammals?,5,Big Bang Theory,95,16
23557,Leonard,13," Okay, let's talk about that.",5,Big Bang Theory,29,5
23558,Sheldon,13," As you know, lizards, cold-blooded animals, lack the ability to sense temperature. But they do move more sluggishly when it's cold. So, lizard weathermen would say things like, bring a sweater, it's slow outside. I love my mind.",5,Big Bang Theory,229,38
23559,Leonard,13," We all do. Now, how about dinner?",5,Big Bang Theory,34,7
23560,Sheldon,13," Oh, I would assume we'd enjoy insects or smaller lizards. We could also pull each other's tails off and grill them, they'll just grow back. Oh! My life-size cardboard Mr. Spock is here! I know he wouldn't care for an outburst of human emotion, but, oh goodie, oh goodie, oh goodie. Commander Spock requesting permission to be unfolded.",5,Big Bang Theory,336,58
23561,Leonard,13, Excuse me.,5,Big Bang Theory,11,2
23562,Sheldon,13," Permission granted, Commander.",5,Big Bang Theory,31,3
23563,Amy,13," Which is why the more intelligent the monkey, the more faeces they fling.",5,Big Bang Theory,74,13
23564,Leonard,13," Excuse me, Amy. Penny, do you have plans for dinner tonight?",5,Big Bang Theory,61,11
23565,Penny,13," Why, you guys going somewhere?",5,Big Bang Theory,31,5
23566,Leonard,13," No, I mean just you and me.",5,Big Bang Theory,28,7
23567,Penny,13," You mean, like a date?",5,Big Bang Theory,23,5
23568,Leonard,13," Not like a date, a date.",5,Big Bang Theory,25,6
23569,Amy,13, Ooh!,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
23571,Penny,13," Um, o-okay. Sure.",5,Big Bang Theory,18,3
23572,Amy,13, Ooh!,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
23574,Sheldon,13," Oh, no! They sent the wrong Spock! Live long and suck it, Zachary Quinto.",5,Big Bang Theory,74,14
23577,Amy,13, How come you never invite Sheldon and me on a double date?,5,Big Bang Theory,59,12
23579,Penny,13, Just a sec.  Too much?,5,Big Bang Theory,23,5
23581,Amy,13, No.,5,Big Bang Theory,4,1
23582,Penny,13," Okay, just hang on.",5,Big Bang Theory,20,4
23583,Amy,13," You just can't handle her raw sexuality, can you?",5,Big Bang Theory,50,9
23585,Penny,13," Uh, about two years ago.",5,Big Bang Theory,25,5
23587,Penny,13, I don't know.,5,Big Bang Theory,14,3
23588,Amy,13, Maybe he's dying. That would be so romantic.,5,Big Bang Theory,45,8
23589,Penny,13, He's not dying.,5,Big Bang Theory,16,3
23590,Amy,13," Too bad. If he were, she could just throw him in bed and ride him right up until he flatlines.",5,Big Bang Theory,95,20
23591,Penny,13, How about this?,5,Big Bang Theory,16,3
23593,Amy,13, Come on.,5,Big Bang Theory,9,2
23594,Penny,13," Yeah, okay, no.",5,Big Bang Theory,16,3
23596,Penny,13," Absolutely not. Look, we're just gonna have dinner and, you know, see how it goes.",5,Big Bang Theory,83,15
23597,Amy,13," If he were dying, would you sleep with him?",5,Big Bang Theory,44,9
23598,Penny,13, What?,5,Big Bang Theory,6,1
23599,Amy,13," Assuming he were dying of something that couldn't be sexually transmitted. You know, like a spear wound to the head.",5,Big Bang Theory,117,20
23600,Penny,13," Okay, he is not dying.",5,Big Bang Theory,23,5
23601,Amy,13, How do you know? Are you a doctor?,5,Big Bang Theory,35,8
23603,Penny,13, Screw it. I'm not gonna make a big deal out of this. It's just dinner.,5,Big Bang Theory,71,15
23604,Amy,13, With a dead man.,5,Big Bang Theory,17,4
23605,Penny,13," Amy, stop it. Oh, God, I'm so nervous.",5,Big Bang Theory,39,8
23607,Penny,13," I know, but we've finally gotten to a place where we can hang out without it being weird. And what if something goes wrong? Then what?",5,Big Bang Theory,135,26
23608,Amy,13, Guess it'll just be Sheldon and me going on a double date with Howard and Bernadette.,5,Big Bang Theory,86,16
23611,Sheldon,13," Mm. I want to build a road, but I need wood. Do either of you fellows have wood?  I don't understand the laughter. The object of Settlers of Catan is to build roads and settlements. To do so requires wood. Now, I have sheep; I need wood. Who has wood for my sheep?",5,Big Bang Theory,265,53
23612,Leonard,13," Okay, how do I look?",5,Big Bang Theory,21,5
23613,Howard,13," Well, more to the point, why are you doing this?",5,Big Bang Theory,49,10
23614,Leonard,13, What are you talking about?,5,Big Bang Theory,28,5
23615,Raj,13, Did you forget what Penny did to you? It took you two years and defiling my sister to turn that frown upside down.,5,Big Bang Theory,115,23
23616,Leonard,13," I didn't defile your sister, we had a relationship.",5,Big Bang Theory,52,9
23617,Raj,13," I heard you call her Brown Sugar. In my book, that's defilement.",5,Big Bang Theory,65,12
23618,Sheldon,13, You want to know my opinion?,5,Big Bang Theory,29,6
23619,Leonard,13," Oh, boy, do I?",5,Big Bang Theory,15,4
23620,Sheldon,13, Sarcasm?,5,Big Bang Theory,9,1
23621,Howard,13, No.,5,Big Bang Theory,4,1
23622,Sheldon,13," All right, then. The reason you're fixated on a good-natured simpleton like Penny is that she's the exact opposite of your first romantic attachment, your brilliant yet intimidating mother.",5,Big Bang Theory,190,29
23623,Leonard,13, Where on earth did you get that from?,5,Big Bang Theory,38,8
23624,Sheldon,13," It's in her book, Needy Baby, Greedy Baby.",5,Big Bang Theory,43,8
23625,Leonard,13, That doesn't make it true.,5,Big Bang Theory,27,5
23626,Sheldon,13," It's called non-fiction for a reason, Leonard.",5,Big Bang Theory,47,7
23627,Leonard,13, See you later.,5,Big Bang Theory,15,3
23628,Raj,13," If they ever make a movie version of that book, you know who should play Leonard's mother? Sandra Bullock.",5,Big Bang Theory,107,19
23629,Howard,13, Why?,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
23630,Raj,13, Because she's great in everything.,5,Big Bang Theory,35,5
23631,Sheldon,13," Now, where were we? Oh, yes. Does anyone have any wood? Oh, come on! I just want wood. Why are you making it so hard?",5,Big Bang Theory,118,25
23633,Leonard,13," So, do they have a name for a first date with someone you used to go out with?",5,Big Bang Theory,79,18
23634,Penny,13," Oh, that's a good question. How about awkward?",5,Big Bang Theory,47,8
23635,Leonard,13," Yeah, that sounds right.",5,Big Bang Theory,25,4
23636,Penny,13, Yeah?,5,Big Bang Theory,6,1
23637,Leonard,13," Hey, how about if we pretend we're actually on a first date? See how that goes.",5,Big Bang Theory,80,16
23638,Penny,13, Okay.,5,Big Bang Theory,6,1
23639,Leonard,13," So, Polly, tell me about yourself.",5,Big Bang Theory,35,6
23640,Penny,13, It's Penny.,5,Big Bang Theory,12,2
23641,Leonard,13," Oh, sorry, yeah. Awkward.",5,Big Bang Theory,26,4
23642,Penny,13," Okay, uh, let's see. I'm from Nebraska, and ever since I was a little girl, I dreamed of moving to L.A. and becoming a movie star. Anyway, after four years of acting lessons and waiting tables, I've done a haemorrhoid commercial and a production of Anne Frank above a bowling alley. So, you know, dreams do come true. Your turn.",5,Big Bang Theory,329,60
23643,Leonard,13," Uh, let's see. Uh, I am an experimental physicist at Cal-Tech, most of my research is with high-powered lasers, and, oh, I've just gotten a big government grant to see if they can be used to knock out incoming ballistic missiles.",5,Big Bang Theory,230,41
23644,Penny,13, Wow. Can they?,5,Big Bang Theory,15,3
23645,Leonard,13," Oh, God, no. The money's pretty good. And I used the equipment to make my own Bat-signal.",5,Big Bang Theory,90,17
23646,Penny,13," Bat-signal? What are you, some kind of nerd?",5,Big Bang Theory,45,8
23647,Leonard,13," Not some kind of nerd, I am the king of the nerds.",5,Big Bang Theory,51,12
23648,Penny,13, What does that mean?,5,Big Bang Theory,21,4
23649,Leonard,13," Uh, it means if anyone displeases me, I don't help them set up their printer.",5,Big Bang Theory,78,15
23650,Penny,13, You are so funny.,5,Big Bang Theory,18,4
23651,Leonard,13, Good. Remember that when I take my shirt off.,5,Big Bang Theory,46,9
23652,Penny,13," Leonard, this is nice. I'm so glad we did this.",5,Big Bang Theory,48,10
23653,Leonard,13," Me, too. So what do you think? Are we gonna get back together?",5,Big Bang Theory,63,13
23654,Penny,13, Whoa. Not so fast.,5,Big Bang Theory,19,4
23655,Leonard,13," I'm sorry, what did I say?",5,Big Bang Theory,27,6
23656,Penny,13," Leonard, you know I will always have feelings for you.",5,Big Bang Theory,55,10
23657,Leonard,13," Oh, God.",5,Big Bang Theory,9,2
23658,Penny,13, What?,5,Big Bang Theory,6,1
23659,Leonard,13, You said always. You'll always have feelings for me.,5,Big Bang Theory,53,9
23660,Penny,13, So?,5,Big Bang Theory,4,1
23661,Leonard,13," So, that sounds more like something you'd say if you didn't want a relationship with someone. This isn't working out, but I'll always have feelings for you. I'm sorry I slept with your best friend, but I'll always have feelings for you. Here's the thing, Lisa, I'm into dudes now, but I'll always have feelings for you.",5,Big Bang Theory,320,57
23662,Penny,13, How would you say it?,5,Big Bang Theory,22,5
23663,Leonard,13, I have feelings for you.,5,Big Bang Theory,25,5
23664,Penny,13, It's the same thing.,5,Big Bang Theory,21,4
23665,Leonard,13," No, it's not. Always made it worse.",5,Big Bang Theory,36,7
23666,Penny,13, You're overthinking this.,5,Big Bang Theory,26,3
23667,Leonard,13," No, I'm not.",5,Big Bang Theory,13,3
23668,Penny,13," Yes, you are. You always overthink things.",5,Big Bang Theory,43,7
23669,Leonard,13, Ah now th-th-there you go. Always made it worse.,5,Big Bang Theory,49,9
23670,Penny,13," See, this is where everything goes wrong, when we talk.",5,Big Bang Theory,56,10
23671,Leonard,13," Well, I don't know how you have a relationship without talking.",5,Big Bang Theory,64,11
23672,Penny,13," Hey, I went out with this guy TJ for eight months, we never talked. To this day, I don't even know what TJ stands for.",5,Big Bang Theory,119,25
23673,Leonard,13," Wait, if you guys didn't talk, what did you never mind, stupid question.",5,Big Bang Theory,73,13
23675,Sheldon,13," And now that I have some wood, I'm going to begin the erection of my settlement.",5,Big Bang Theory,81,16
23676,Raj,13, He's got to be doing this on purpose.,5,Big Bang Theory,38,8
23677,Howard,13," Ooh, eight thirty. You and Penny decide to go out and paint the town beige?",5,Big Bang Theory,76,15
23678,Leonard,13, You're thirty years old and you live with your mother.,5,Big Bang Theory,55,10
23679,Raj,13, I guess it didn't go well.,5,Big Bang Theory,27,6
23680,Sheldon,13, We don't know that. Not to a certainty. All we know is that Leonard is home.,5,Big Bang Theory,77,16
23681,Howard,13, How about now?,5,Big Bang Theory,15,3
23682,Sheldon,13," Again, not enough evidence. For all we know, he's being murdered. Now, back to our game.",5,Big Bang Theory,89,16
23683,Raj,13, You were in the middle of an erection.,5,Big Bang Theory,39,8
23684,Sheldon,13," Oh, of course. It's right here in my hand.",5,Big Bang Theory,43,9
23686,Leonard,13, What does she want from me now?  What's up?,5,Big Bang Theory,44,9
23687,Penny,13, Do not overthink this.  ,5,Big Bang Theory,25,4
23688,Leonard,13, I don't understand.,5,Big Bang Theory,20,3
23689,Penny,13, Bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup.,5,Big Bang Theory,29,1
23690,Leonard,13," Okay, but earlier it seemed like",5,Big Bang Theory,33,6
23691,Penny,13, No talking.,5,Big Bang Theory,12,2
23692,Leonard,13, Even during? â€˜Cause sometimes I have questions.,5,Big Bang Theory,50,7
23694,Penny,13," Well, that was fun.",5,Big Bang Theory,20,4
23695,Leonard,13," Yeah, except for when I got the foot cramp.",5,Big Bang Theory,44,9
23696,Penny,13," You hung in there, though.",5,Big Bang Theory,27,5
23697,Leonard,13," Well, there was a lot at stake.",5,Big Bang Theory,32,7
23698,Penny,13, So what do you want to do now?,5,Big Bang Theory,31,8
23699,Leonard,13," Well, I want to go get my asthma inhaler, but it might ruin the moment. Just, just help me out here. How does a miserable date end in sex?",5,Big Bang Theory,139,29
23700,Penny,13," I don't know, it's complicated.",5,Big Bang Theory,32,5
23701,Leonard,13," Well, I'm a pretty smart guy, and right now my brain has dibs on the blood supply, so give it a go.",5,Big Bang Theory,100,22
23702,Penny,13," Okay, it's just, at the restaurant when you said you wanted us to be together again, it got very real very fast and I panicked.",5,Big Bang Theory,128,25
23703,Leonard,13, Why? What are you afraid of?,5,Big Bang Theory,29,6
23704,Penny,13," Well, what if we do go out and I do something stupid and dump you again?",5,Big Bang Theory,73,16
23705,Leonard,13, What if I dump you?,5,Big Bang Theory,20,5
23706,Penny,13," Come on, be serious.",5,Big Bang Theory,21,4
23707,Leonard,13," Well, how about if we don't think about this as a relationship? It could be more like a new version of software. Penny and Leonard 2.0. We can test it internally, shake out the bugs, and if we both feel it's solid, then we'll roll it out to the public.",5,Big Bang Theory,253,50
23708,Penny,13, So we don't tell people we're back together?,5,Big Bang Theory,45,8
23709,Leonard,13, Exactly. We pretend like our date went badly.,5,Big Bang Theory,46,8
23710,Penny,13," Well, we don't really have to pretend.",5,Big Bang Theory,39,7
23711,Leonard,13, And we let them think that we decided to just be friends and that everything's cool.,5,Big Bang Theory,85,16
23712,Penny,13," Okay, great. Hey, I just remembered. I still got one of your inhalers.",5,Big Bang Theory,71,13
23713,Leonard,13, I can't believe you kept this.,5,Big Bang Theory,31,6
23714,Penny,13," Yeah, I was gonna throw it away, but I just couldn't.",5,Big Bang Theory,54,11
23715,Leonard,13, That is so sweet. In 25 to 30 minutes I'm gonna show you how much this means to me.,5,Big Bang Theory,84,19
23717,Sheldon,13, Leonard?,5,Big Bang Theory,9,1
23718,Leonard,13," Yeah, hi, hi. How's it going?",5,Big Bang Theory,30,6
23719,Sheldon,13," Uh, can't complain. Thanks for asking. Well, what were you doing out at three o'clock in the morning?",5,Big Bang Theory,102,18
23720,Leonard,13," Well, uh, uh, what are you doing up?",5,Big Bang Theory,37,8
23721,Sheldon,13, I was using the bathroom.,5,Big Bang Theory,26,5
23722,Leonard,13," Yeah, well, so was I.",5,Big Bang Theory,22,5
23723,Sheldon,13, Really? I didn't see you in there.,5,Big Bang Theory,35,7
23724,Leonard,13," Obviously, when I saw that you were in ours, I went and used another one.",5,Big Bang Theory,74,15
23725,Sheldon,13, Where?,5,Big Bang Theory,7,1
23726,Leonard,13," The, the gas station across the street.",5,Big Bang Theory,40,7
23727,Sheldon,13, In your pyjamas?,5,Big Bang Theory,17,3
23728,Leonard,13, Yes.,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
23729,Sheldon,13, Without shoes?,5,Big Bang Theory,15,2
23730,Leonard,13, Yes.,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
23731,Sheldon,13, On a cold winter's night?,5,Big Bang Theory,26,5
23732,Leonard,13, Yes.,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
23733,Sheldon,13, Seems unlikely. Did you bring your asthma inhaler?,5,Big Bang Theory,51,8
23734,Leonard,13," Uh, uh, uh, yes, I did.",5,Big Bang Theory,24,6
23735,Sheldon,13," Well, then, I guess it's plausible. Hang on a second, mister.",5,Big Bang Theory,62,11
23736,Leonard,13, What?,5,Big Bang Theory,6,1
23737,Sheldon,13," After you used the facilities at the gas station, did you make a purchase?",5,Big Bang Theory,75,14
23738,Leonard,13, What?,5,Big Bang Theory,6,1
23739,Sheldon,13," It's customary, when using the rest room at a retail establishment, to make a small purchase. Did you?",5,Big Bang Theory,103,18
23740,Leonard,13, No.,5,Big Bang Theory,4,1
23741,Sheldon,13, Here's two dollars. Go buy some beef jerky.,5,Big Bang Theory,44,8
23742,Leonard,13, I don't want beef jerky.,5,Big Bang Theory,25,5
23743,Sheldon,13, It's not about you. It's about a poor immigrant from Pakistan trying to make his way in America by working the graveyard shift at the Colorado Boulevard Chevron.,5,Big Bang Theory,162,28
23744,Leonard,13, Fine.,5,Big Bang Theory,6,1
23745,Sheldon,13," Needy Baby, Greedy Baby indeed.",5,Big Bang Theory,32,5
23747,Sheldon,13, Leonard will be here in a moment. He's looking for a different parking space.,5,Big Bang Theory,78,14
23748,Howard,13, Why?,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
23749,Sheldon,13," We were next to a car with an ask me about my grandchildren bumper sticker, and I was afraid if we ran into them on the way out, I'd be obligated to do so.",5,Big Bang Theory,156,34
23751,Amy,13," Me, too. Out of deference to them, let's not flaunt our happy relationship.",5,Big Bang Theory,76,13
23752,Sheldon,13," You have a keen insight into the human heart, Amy Farrah Fowler.",5,Big Bang Theory,65,12
23753,Leonard,13, We are next to a Suburu with a Gore/Lieberman bumper sticker.,5,Big Bang Theory,62,11
23754,Sheldon,13," Well, I doubt they'd want to talk about that, so we're fine.",5,Big Bang Theory,61,12
23755,Howard,13, I'm surprised to see you here after it went so badly with Penny.,5,Big Bang Theory,65,13
23756,Leonard,13," Well, hey, we're grown-ups. We can still be friends.",5,Big Bang Theory,53,9
23758,Howard,13, Why not?,5,Big Bang Theory,9,2
23760,Howard,13, Really?,5,Big Bang Theory,8,1
23762,Penny,13," Here you go, guys, let me get you going with some water. You need menus or you know what you want?",5,Big Bang Theory,99,21
23763,Howard,13," Leonard knows what he wants, but it looks like he's not gonna get it from you.",5,Big Bang Theory,79,16
23765,Penny,13," No, that's okay, Bernadette. Sometimes these things just don't work out.",5,Big Bang Theory,73,11
23766,Leonard,13," Yeah, it's all good. We-We'll always have feelings for each other.",5,Big Bang Theory,67,11
23768,Leonard,13," See, she knew what always meant.",5,Big Bang Theory,33,6
23769,Penny,13," Wow, you're like a dog with a bone, aren't you?",5,Big Bang Theory,48,10
23770,Leonard,13, I'm just making a point.,5,Big Bang Theory,25,5
23771,Penny,13, Is the point that you don't know when to let something go?,5,Big Bang Theory,59,12
23772,Sheldon,13," People, people, please, before you say something you both regret, I'd like to place my order.",5,Big Bang Theory,94,16
23773,Penny,13," Yeah, just hang on, Sheldon. You know why we can't be together? Because you always have to be right.",5,Big Bang Theory,101,19
23774,Leonard,13," Oh, that is not true.",5,Big Bang Theory,22,5
23775,Sheldon,13, I've got to go with Leonard on this. He is wrong more than anyone I know.,5,Big Bang Theory,74,16
23776,Penny,13, You know what? I just realized I'm on a break. I'll get someone else.,5,Big Bang Theory,70,14
23777,Leonard,13, Well,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
23778,Sheldon,13," Leonard, promise me that when our new waitress comes over, you will not start a complicated on-again, off-again relationship with her, because I am very, very hungry.",5,Big Bang Theory,167,27
23780,Leonard,13, Unbelievable. ,5,Big Bang Theory,15,1
23781,Penny,13, Mind explaining to me why you were being such a jerk at the restaurant?,5,Big Bang Theory,72,14
23782,Leonard,13," Well, I was trying to act like we weren't seeing each other. That was the plan, right?",5,Big Bang Theory,87,17
23783,Penny,13," No, the plan was to tell people we decided to stay friends. That's a little hard to do when you're always being such a tool bag.",5,Big Bang Theory,129,26
23784,Leonard,13, You know what? I don't have to stand here and take this crap. ,5,Big Bang Theory,63,13
23785,Penny,13, The hell do you think you're going?,5,Big Bang Theory,36,7
23786,Leonard,13, Isn't sex after fighting kind of what we do now?,5,Big Bang Theory,49,10
23787,Penny,13," Yeah, kind of, yeah.",5,Big Bang Theory,21,4
23789,Leonard,13, What are we doing?,5,Big Bang Theory,19,4
23790,Penny,13, What do you mean?,5,Big Bang Theory,18,4
23791,Leonard,13, Every scenario I play out for you and me ends badly.,5,Big Bang Theory,53,11
23792,Penny,13, That's because you overthink everything.,5,Big Bang Theory,41,5
23794,Leonard,13, What? Yeah.,5,Big Bang Theory,12,2
23795,Sheldon,13, This is a disaster. I distinctly ordered the Leonard Nimoy Mr. Spock cardboard standee. Why would I feel safer with Zachary Quinto at the foot of my bed?,5,Big Bang Theory,154,28
23796,Leonard,13," I don't know, he was pretty badass on Heroes.",5,Big Bang Theory,46,9
23797,Sheldon,13," You're right, I'll give him a shot.",5,Big Bang Theory,36,7
23798,Leonard,13," Hang on. Penny, do you have plans for dinner?",5,Big Bang Theory,46,9
23799,Penny,13," Why, you guys going somewhere?",5,Big Bang Theory,31,5
23800,Leonard,13," No, I mean just you and me.",5,Big Bang Theory,28,7
23801,Amy,13, Ooh!,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
23803,Penny,13," Uh, have you thought this through?",5,Big Bang Theory,35,6
23804,Leonard,13," Yes, and I think we should go anyway.",5,Big Bang Theory,38,8
23805,Sheldon,13," No, can't do it. Sorry, Quinto, you're going back.",5,Big Bang Theory,51,9
23807,Amy,13," If you and Leonard get back together, Sheldon and I will finally have someone to go on double dates with.",5,Big Bang Theory,106,20
23809,Amy,13," Fine, we can double with you, too. So insecure.",5,Big Bang Theory,48,9
23811,Amy,13, Penny?,5,Big Bang Theory,7,1
23813,Penny,13," Well, it's a little late for me to start saying no, isn't it?",5,Big Bang Theory,62,13
23814,Amy,13, Penny?,5,Big Bang Theory,7,1
23815,Penny,13," Sorry, just remembered I've got to stop by the drugstore.",5,Big Bang Theory,58,10
23817,Sheldon,14," Hello. I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and welcome to the premiere episode of Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. Over the next 52 weeks, you and I are going to explore the dynamic world of vexillology.",5,Big Bang Theory,199,35
23818,Amy,14," Hang on, Dr. C. What's vexillology?",5,Big Bang Theory,36,6
23819,Sheldon,14, Vexillology is the study of flags.,5,Big Bang Theory,35,6
23820,Amy,14, Cool. I think I just learned something.,5,Big Bang Theory,40,7
23821,Sheldon,14, Did you have fun doing it?,5,Big Bang Theory,27,6
23822,Amy,14, I'll say.,5,Big Bang Theory,10,2
23823,Sheldon,14," Fun and information are two sides to this video podcast, not unlike the only two-sided state flag, Oregon. Oh, look. Hello, Mr. Beaver. In future episodes, we'll answer some burning questions. What's the only non-rectangular flag? What animal appears most often on flags? What animal appears second most often on flags? And more.",5,Big Bang Theory,330,53
23824,Amy,14, Sweet!,5,Big Bang Theory,7,1
23825,Sheldon,14, Why are you waving a white flag?,5,Big Bang Theory,33,7
23826,Amy,14, I'm surrendering to fun.,5,Big Bang Theory,25,4
23827,Leonard,14," Excuse me, sorry, excuse me.",5,Big Bang Theory,29,5
23828,Sheldon,14, Cut. Did you not see we are rolling?,5,Big Bang Theory,37,8
23829,Leonard,14, Sorry. I'm having dinner with Penny. I have to get out of here.,5,Big Bang Theory,64,13
23830,Sheldon,14, And I have flag knowledge that I have to get out of here!,5,Big Bang Theory,58,13
23831,Amy,14, You okay?,5,Big Bang Theory,10,2
23832,Sheldon,14," No, I'm a little rattled. But like the flag over Fort Sumter, I'm still here. And, take two. Hello. I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and welcome to the premiere episode of Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. Over the next 52 weeks, you and I are going to explore the dynamic world of vexillology.",5,Big Bang Theory,292,53
23833,Amy,14," Hang on, Dr. Cooper. What's vexillology?",5,Big Bang Theory,41,6
23834,Sheldon,14, Vexillology is why is there a face on that flag?,5,Big Bang Theory,49,10
23835,Amy,14, It's Ferdinand T. Flag. I thought he might help bring in some younger viewers.,5,Big Bang Theory,79,14
23836,Sheldon,14," Confound it! You're right, it's brilliant. Let's take it from the top.",5,Big Bang Theory,71,12
23838,Penny,14, That was a really nice dinner. I'm glad you asked me out again.,5,Big Bang Theory,64,13
23839,Leonard,14," Me, too, I missed you.",5,Big Bang Theory,23,5
23840,Penny,14, You see me all the time. You sure you just don't miss the sex?,5,Big Bang Theory,63,14
23841,Leonard,14," Well, yeah, sex with you is pretty great. Have you ever tried it?",5,Big Bang Theory,66,13
23842,Penny,14," I have. You are not wrong. I just think if we're gonna try dating again, we should take things slow.",5,Big Bang Theory,101,20
23843,Leonard,14," Oh, I can take it slow. Did I ever tell you about my first girlfriend in high school, Karen Berberick? To this day she doesn't know we were going out. Made it easier on her when I broke things off.",5,Big Bang Theory,198,40
23844,Penny,14," Okay, well, maybe not that slow.",5,Big Bang Theory,33,6
23845,Leonard,14," How about this, are you familiar with the typical development for computer software?",5,Big Bang Theory,85,13
23846,Penny,14," You know, just for fun, let's say I'm not.",5,Big Bang Theory,43,9
23847,Leonard,14," Before an application is released, they give it a trial run. W-We could do that. And if we hit a rough spot, instead of getting mad, just say, hey, we found a bug, and we report it so it can be fixed.",5,Big Bang Theory,201,42
23848,Penny,14, You mean like a beta test?,5,Big Bang Theory,27,6
23849,Leonard,14," Well, technically, this would be an alpha test. A beta test requires people that weren't involved in the development of the appli",5,Big Bang Theory,130,22
23850,Penny,14," Seriously, do I not get credit for knowing beta test?",5,Big Bang Theory,54,10
23851,Leonard,14," No, you should. Absolutely. That was me being pedantic. That's our first bug. You reported it. I can fix that. See? This is good.",5,Big Bang Theory,130,24
23852,Penny,14, All right. Let's give it a shot.,5,Big Bang Theory,33,7
23853,Leonard,14," Great. You keep a list, I'll keep a list. At some point, we'll exchange.",5,Big Bang Theory,73,14
23854,Penny,14," Okay. Good night, Leonard.",5,Big Bang Theory,27,4
23855,Leonard,14," Night. Attaboy, Hofstadter. Nothing gets the ladies hotter than software development analogies. Hey, I'm back.",5,Big Bang Theory,111,15
23856,Sheldon,14, Cut! Take 47.,5,Big Bang Theory,14,3
23858,Sheldon,14, Here's an interesting fact about flags.,5,Big Bang Theory,40,6
23859,Raj,14, I will take that action.,5,Big Bang Theory,25,5
23860,Sheldon,14," The flags of Liechtenstein and Haiti were identical by coincidence, a fact that wasn't discovered until they competed against each other at the 1936 Olympics. And thankfully, their embarrassment was overshadowed by the rise of Fascism.",5,Big Bang Theory,236,36
23861,Howard,14, Let's see the new phone.,5,Big Bang Theory,25,5
23862,Raj,14," I stopped on the way to work. Hey, do you want to peel the plastic off with me?",5,Big Bang Theory,80,18
23863,Howard,14," Really? Me? That's, like, the best part.",5,Big Bang Theory,41,7
23864,Raj,14," Grab a corner. Whoa, what's your hurry, cowboy? Savour the moment.",5,Big Bang Theory,67,11
23865,Howard,14," Oh, yeah.",5,Big Bang Theory,10,2
23866,Sheldon,14," Speaking of cowboys, do you know what country has not one but two cows on its flag? The tiny landlocked nation of Andorra. Oh, the next classic episode of Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags is writing itself.",5,Big Bang Theory,213,38
23867,Howard,14," Oh, let me try the voice recognition.",5,Big Bang Theory,38,7
23868,Raj,14," Hey, I let you peel the plastic, don't get greedy.  Hello?",5,Big Bang Theory,59,11
23870,Raj,14, What's your name?,5,Big Bang Theory,18,3
23872,Howard,14, Look at that. There's finally a woman in your life you can talk to.,5,Big Bang Theory,68,14
23873,Raj,14, Are you single?,5,Big Bang Theory,16,3
23875,Raj,14," Yeah, you're right, that's too personal. We hardly know each other. How about a cup of coffee?",5,Big Bang Theory,95,17
23877,Raj,14, I will see you gentlemen later.,5,Big Bang Theory,32,6
23878,Howard,14, She is gonna break his heart.,5,Big Bang Theory,30,6
23880,Amy,14," For someone who has a machine that can travel anywhere in time and space, Doctor Who sure does have a thing for modern-day London.",5,Big Bang Theory,131,24
23881,Sheldon,14," Careful, it's that kind of sass that can get a person uninvited to this year's Who Con.",5,Big Bang Theory,88,17
23882,Penny,14," Uh, we're not counting this as a date, are we?",5,Big Bang Theory,47,10
23883,Leonard,14," Um, I'm not sure, but I think the right answer here is no.",5,Big Bang Theory,59,13
23884,Leonard,14, Even Doctor Who?,5,Big Bang Theory,17,3
23885,Penny,14, Even Doctor Who.,5,Big Bang Theory,17,3
23886,Sheldon,14," All right, that's it. Who Con, you're out.",5,Big Bang Theory,43,8
23887,Leonard,14," Okay, bug report taken. Next time I will have a better plan for our evening's activity.",5,Big Bang Theory,88,16
23888,Penny,14," Well, thank you. I'll see you tomorrow.",5,Big Bang Theory,40,7
23889,Leonard,14," Oh, wait, here, almost forgot. Here.",5,Big Bang Theory,37,6
23890,Penny,14, What's this?,5,Big Bang Theory,13,2
23891,Leonard,14, My bug report to you.,5,Big Bang Theory,22,5
23892,Penny,14," Well, that's quite a list you got there.",5,Big Bang Theory,41,8
23893,Leonard,14, It's colour coded.,5,Big Bang Theory,19,3
23894,Penny,14, Oh.,5,Big Bang Theory,4,1
23895,Leonard,14," Uh, red means fix right away. Yellow is eh, whenever you get a chance. And green is I could probably learn to live with it. There's a key down here at the bottom. It's neat, huh?",5,Big Bang Theory,179,36
23896,Penny,14, Yep.,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
23897,Leonard,14," So, have a good night.",5,Big Bang Theory,23,5
23898,Penny,14, Yep.,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
23899,Leonard,14," Look at that. Some day, we will tell future generations that dating used to be hard.",5,Big Bang Theory,85,16
23900,Amy,14, What's baffling me is what you could've possibly put on the list. Hair too golden? Laugh too musical? World too much a better place for her mere presence in it?,5,Big Bang Theory,161,30
23901,Sheldon,14, How about constantly talks with food in her mouth?,5,Big Bang Theory,51,9
23902,Amy,14," Her heart's full of love, no one cares what's in her mouth.",5,Big Bang Theory,60,12
23904,Raj,14," So, Siri, what's happening? How are you?",5,Big Bang Theory,41,7
23906,Raj,14, What are you doing right now?,5,Big Bang Theory,30,6
23908,Raj,14, You have a beautiful voice.,5,Big Bang Theory,28,5
23910,Raj,14, I bet it is. Why don't women like me?,5,Big Bang Theory,38,9
23912,Raj,14," No need. I've already done that. Siri, do you have a last name?",5,Big Bang Theory,64,13
23914,Raj,14," Ah, one name. Like, uh, Cher, Madonna, Adele. All the women who rock me. My name is Rajesh, but you can call me Raj.",5,Big Bang Theory,117,24
23916,Raj,14, I'd like you to call me sexy.,5,Big Bang Theory,30,7
23918,Raj,14, Okay.,5,Big Bang Theory,6,1
23921,Raj,14," Thank you, darling.",5,Big Bang Theory,20,3
23923,Sheldon,14," Well done, Dr. Koothrappali.",5,Big Bang Theory,29,4
23924,Raj,14, I'm sorry?,5,Big Bang Theory,11,2
23925,Sheldon,14, You've taken a great evolutionary leap by abandoning human interaction and allowing yourself to romantically bond with a soulless machine. Kudos.,5,Big Bang Theory,146,21
23926,Raj,14, I haven't bonded with it.,5,Big Bang Theory,26,5
23927,Sheldon,14," Oh, no, of course. I understand. You're afraid the world isn't ready for your taboo love. Your secret's safe with me.",5,Big Bang Theory,118,21
23928,Raj,14, It's just a phone.,5,Big Bang Theory,19,4
23930,Sheldon,14, Kripke.,5,Big Bang Theory,8,1
23932,Raj,14," Thanks, Barry. Siri, remind me Friday morning to make my famous popovers.",5,Big Bang Theory,74,12
23939,Raj,14," Hey, don't talk to her like that. She's a lady.",5,Big Bang Theory,48,10
23942,Penny,14, It's open.,5,Big Bang Theory,11,2
23943,Leonard,14, Hey. You ready to go?,5,Big Bang Theory,22,5
23944,Penny,14," Yeah, hang on. Let me just finish this chapter.",5,Big Bang Theory,48,9
23945,Leonard,14, Can you finish it later?,5,Big Bang Theory,25,5
23946,Penny,14," No, I can't. Reading books is a big part of my life now because, you know, we'd have more fun things to talk about if I read more.",5,Big Bang Theory,131,28
23947,Leonard,14, Great. Good. Great. What are you reading?,5,Big Bang Theory,42,7
23948,Penny,14, Two Weeks to Rock Hard Abs.,5,Big Bang Theory,28,6
23949,Leonard,14," They kind of spoil the ending right in the name of that, don't they? All right. Look, just remember how this works. We don't get mad about these things. Uh, speaking of which, I've addressed your bug report on my date planning. Got a really fun evening for you. It's kind of a surprise.",5,Big Bang Theory,287,54
23950,Penny,14," All right. Terrific. Well, let me just go find a pair of shoes that aren't so tall. We wouldn't want you to feel like you were out for a walk with your mommy.",5,Big Bang Theory,159,33
23951,Leonard,14, Thank you.,5,Big Bang Theory,11,2
23952,Penny,14," Yeah. Oh. Here's my list for you, right there.",5,Big Bang Theory,47,9
23953,Leonard,14," All right, fair enough. I certainly can be quieter when we kiss. I thought it was an expression of passion, but if it's coming across as juicy and weird, who wants that? Uh, uh, I'm sorry, can you be more specific on how my eyebrows are stupid? Nah, never mind, it's right here.",5,Big Bang Theory,279,53
23955,Raj,14, Good timing. Dinner's almost ready.,5,Big Bang Theory,36,5
23956,Howard,14, Great.,5,Big Bang Theory,7,1
23958,Howard,14," Yeah, what are we eating?",5,Big Bang Theory,26,5
23959,Raj,14," Oh, an exotic little treat. I was just talking to Siri about Peking duck, and she said she knew about four Chinese grocers, two of which were fairly close to me. Her spontaneity is contagious.",5,Big Bang Theory,193,35
23961,Howard,14, Yes. His phone.,5,Big Bang Theory,16,3
23963,Howard,14, Uh-huh.,5,Big Bang Theory,8,1
23964,Raj,14," Can I pour you some wine? I think you'll enjoy it. The traditional choice with Peking duck is a Sauvignon Blanc, but Siri suggested an off-dry Riesling. I wasn't sure, but I didn't want to have an argument with her in the middle of Trader Joe's. Now, what should we put Siri in for dinner? Leopard, sparkles, or to paraphrase Coco Chanel, you can never go wrong with a little black case. Siri, play some smooth jazz.",5,Big Bang Theory,417,77
23966,Raj,14," Oh, my God, Kenny G? This woman can read me like a book. I can't believe I bought my soul mate at Glendale Galleria.",5,Big Bang Theory,117,24
23969,Penny,14, This is amazing. How did you even get this idea?,5,Big Bang Theory,49,10
23970,Leonard,14, I called your dad. I asked him what things you liked to do when you were a kid. This seemed easier than getting a cow out here so you could tip it.,5,Big Bang Theory,148,32
23971,Penny,14," Okay, you're kind of really great.",5,Big Bang Theory,35,6
23972,Leonard,14, You mean for a person whose neck massages feel like an eagle is trying to carry you to its nest?,5,Big Bang Theory,97,20
23973,Penny,14," Okay, bug report. I just complimented you. You should take it and shut up.",5,Big Bang Theory,75,14
23974,Leonard,14," Right. Sorry, sorry.",5,Big Bang Theory,21,3
23975,Penny,14, And stop apologizing all the time.,5,Big Bang Theory,35,6
23976,Leonard,14, Right. Sorry.,5,Big Bang Theory,14,2
23977,Penny,14," All right, let's shoot stuff. You want me to show you what to do?",5,Big Bang Theory,66,14
23978,Leonard,14, I play a lot of Grand Theft Auto. I think I know how to handle a gat.,5,Big Bang Theory,70,17
23979,Penny,14, Wow. You are cute when you get all gangsta. ,5,Big Bang Theory,45,9
23981,Leonard,14," So, I've got a gunshot wound. That's pretty badass.",5,Big Bang Theory,52,9
23982,Penny,14," No, you've got a Reebok with a gunshot wound and an ouchie on your pinkie toe.",5,Big Bang Theory,79,16
23983,Leonard,14, Hello? They gave me a Band-Aid. Hospitals do not issue Band-Aids unless it is medically necessary. That is the law.,5,Big Bang Theory,116,20
23984,Penny,14," Well, thank you for a really cool evening.",5,Big Bang Theory,43,8
23985,Leonard,14, Thank you for hiding my Star Wars socks at the emergency room. Is it a good time to evaluate the beta test and see where we stand?,5,Big Bang Theory,131,27
23986,Penny,14, Things are looking good.,5,Big Bang Theory,25,4
23987,Leonard,14," So, are we still taking things slow? Because a gunshot wound today, last week, I slammed my thumb in the kitchen drawer. We don't know how much time I have.",5,Big Bang Theory,157,30
23988,Penny,14," Good night, you.",5,Big Bang Theory,17,3
23989,Sheldon,14," Guten Tag, das YouTube. Ich bin ein Bavarian.",5,Big Bang Theory,46,8
23990,Amy,14, Und ich bin eine pretzel!,5,Big Bang Theory,26,5
23991,Sheldon,14, Und dis is Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun,5,Big Bang Theory,39,7
23992,Amy,14, Mit,5,Big Bang Theory,4,1
23993,Sheldon,14, Flags.,5,Big Bang Theory,7,1
23996,Raj,14, Thank you.  ,5,Big Bang Theory,13,2
23998,Raj,14, No!,5,Big Bang Theory,4,1
24000,Leonard,15, Aaargh. What the hell?,5,Big Bang Theory,23,4
24001,Sheldon,15, Emergency preparedness drill.,5,Big Bang Theory,30,3
24002,Leonard,15," Oh, no, come on!",5,Big Bang Theory,17,4
24003,Sheldon,15," Yeah, you know how it works. Once a quarter, keep our readiness up. Now, rise and shine, sleepy head. Half the town is probably dead.",5,Big Bang Theory,134,25
24004,Leonard,15, I have to get a lock for my door.,5,Big Bang Theory,34,9
24005,Sheldon,15," I think you'll like the drill tonight. I've tried to make it fun. Each of these cards contains a detailed scenario of a possible apocalyptic event. Everything from wild fires to a surprise invasion by Canada. Pick a catastrophe, any catastrophe.",5,Big Bang Theory,246,41
24006,Leonard,15," Sheldon, Canada is not going to invade California.",5,Big Bang Theory,51,8
24007,Sheldon,15," Yeah, really? You think those hippies in Washington and Oregon can stop them?",5,Big Bang Theory,78,13
24008,Leonard,15, Fine.,5,Big Bang Theory,6,1
24009,Sheldon,15," All righty! An 8.2 magnitude earthquake devastates Pasadena, reducing mighty edifices to dust, engulfing the city in flames. The streets flow with blood and echo with the cries of the wounded. Oh, excellent choice. Now, put on your hard hat and safety vest.",5,Big Bang Theory,258,43
24010,Leonard,15," Oh, fun. I get to spend another night in front of our apartment dressed like one of the Village People.",5,Big Bang Theory,104,20
24011,Sheldon,15," You make that joke every three months. I still don't get it. Leonard, wait. What are you doing?",5,Big Bang Theory,96,18
24012,Leonard,15," I don't know, what am I doing?",5,Big Bang Theory,31,7
24013,Sheldon,15," Look around you, there's hypothetical broken glass everywhere. Really? You're going to face Armageddon without your orthotics? All right, your choice.  Uh-oh, hypothetical aftershock!",5,Big Bang Theory,184,24
24014,Leonard,15, Aah!,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
24015,Sheldon,15, And that's why we wear hard hats.,5,Big Bang Theory,34,7
24017,Howard,15," Check it out, press release from NASA.",5,Big Bang Theory,39,7
24018,Raj,15," Um, Expedition 31 will launch this spring to the International Space Station. Crew members will include Commander Tom â€˜Tombo' Johnson, astronaut Mike â€˜Supernova' Novacelik and Payload Specialist Howard Wolowitz.",5,Big Bang Theory,216,29
24019,Howard,15, This is going right into my synagogue's newsletter.,5,Big Bang Theory,52,8
24020,Raj,15," Dude, if you're going to be an astronaut, you need to pick a cool nickname.",5,Big Bang Theory,76,15
24021,Howard,15, I don't get to pick it. The other guys have to give it to me.,5,Big Bang Theory,62,15
24022,Raj,15," Oh. If I had one, it would be Brown Dynamite.",5,Big Bang Theory,46,10
24023,Howard,15, Are you not listening to me? The other astronauts have to give you your nickname.,5,Big Bang Theory,82,15
24024,Raj,15, Are you not looking at me? I am Brown Dynamite. Why do you put six sugars in your coffee?,5,Big Bang Theory,90,19
24025,Leonard,15, Because the cafeteria doesn't offer little packets of methamphetamine.,5,Big Bang Theory,71,9
24026,Howard,15," Emergency drill night last night, huh?",5,Big Bang Theory,39,6
24027,Leonard,15, Uh-huh.,5,Big Bang Theory,8,1
24028,Raj,15, How'd you do?,5,Big Bang Theory,14,3
24029,Leonard,15," You know what, I'm so tired I can't even think straight. I'm going home. Will one of you guys give this nutbag a ride back later?",5,Big Bang Theory,130,26
24030,Sheldon,15, You can't go home. You have to take me to the dentist at four o'clock.,5,Big Bang Theory,71,15
24031,Leonard,15," Oh, can't you take the bus to the dentist?",5,Big Bang Theory,43,9
24032,Sheldon,15," Of course I can. It's coming back under the residual effects of the anaesthesia, that's the problem. Two years ago after a deep gum cleaning, I thought I got on a bus but somehow wound up on a booze cruise to Mexico.",5,Big Bang Theory,217,42
24033,Raj,15, They put you under for a cleaning?,5,Big Bang Theory,35,7
24034,Sheldon,15," Yeah, they have to, I'm a biter.",5,Big Bang Theory,33,7
24035,Leonard,15," Whatever, Sheldon. I'm exhausted. I'm not taking you to the dentist.",5,Big Bang Theory,69,11
24036,Sheldon,15," Wrong, sir. Wrong. Under section 37B of the roommate agreement, miscellaneous duties, you are obligated to take me to the dentist. See? It's right here after providing a confirmation sniff on questionable dairy products.â€ù",5,Big Bang Theory,224,34
24037,Leonard,15," You know what, I am sick of the roommate agreement. It's ridiculous. I'm your roommate, not your chauffeur. You know, I had better things to do yesterday than drive you all the way to the good model train store in Garden Grove because the one in Pasadena has gotten too big for its britches.",5,Big Bang Theory,292,54
24038,Sheldon,15," Well, it has. Ask anybody.",5,Big Bang Theory,27,5
24039,Leonard,15, I don't care. I'm done.,5,Big Bang Theory,24,5
24040,Sheldon,15, Hold on. Are you saying that you want to invoke Clause 209?,5,Big Bang Theory,60,12
24041,Leonard,15," I don't know what that is, but if it means I can go home and sleep, then yes.",5,Big Bang Theory,78,18
24042,Sheldon,15," Think carefully here. Clause 209 suspends our friendship, and strips down the roommate agreement to its bare essentials. Our responsibilities toward each other would only be rent, utilities and a perfunctory chin jut of recognition as we pass in the hall.  â€˜Sup?",5,Big Bang Theory,265,42
24043,Leonard,15, Where do I sign?,5,Big Bang Theory,17,4
24044,Sheldon,15, Right here. Use your finger.,5,Big Bang Theory,29,5
24045,Leonard,15, There. Done.,5,Big Bang Theory,13,2
24046,Sheldon,15," All right. That's it. We are now no longer companions, boon or otherwise. We are now merely acquaintances. To amend the words of Toy Story, you have not got a friend in me.",5,Big Bang Theory,173,33
24047,Leonard,15, I'm gonna go home and take a nap.,5,Big Bang Theory,34,8
24048,Sheldon,15," Yeah, well, tell it to someone who cares.",5,Big Bang Theory,42,8
24050,Howard,15, I got pretty exciting NASA news today. Next week I fly to Houston for orientation and zero-gravity elimination drills.,5,Big Bang Theory,119,19
24051,Penny,15, What does that mean?,5,Big Bang Theory,21,4
24053,Howard,15," Open the pod bay doors, HAL.",5,Big Bang Theory,29,6
24054,Raj,15, Maybe your nickname should be Brown Dynamite.,5,Big Bang Theory,46,7
24055,Sheldon,15," Hello, dear friends. And Dr. Hofstadter.",5,Big Bang Theory,41,6
24056,Leonard,15, â€˜Sup?,5,Big Bang Theory,8,1
24057,Sheldon,15," â€˜Sup? My apologies. I would've been here sooner, but the bus kept stopping for other people to get on it.",5,Big Bang Theory,108,20
24058,Amy,15, I saved you a dumpling.,5,Big Bang Theory,24,5
24059,Sheldon,15," Oh, your concern for me is touching. It will serve you well when you take me to the dentist tomorrow.",5,Big Bang Theory,102,20
24060,Amy,15," I'm sorry, Sheldon, I'm busy. I'm right in the middle of my addiction study. I've got a lab full of alcoholic monkeys, and tomorrow's the day we switch them to O'Doul's.",5,Big Bang Theory,170,31
24061,Sheldon,15," You're my girlfriend and you're not going to cater to my every need? Oh, where'd the magic go?",5,Big Bang Theory,95,18
24062,Penny,15," Sheldon, that's not what girlfriends are for. Although, you don't use them for what they're for, so what do I know?",5,Big Bang Theory,116,21
24064,Howard,15," Absolutely. But when Ma's hips give out, you're up, kid.",5,Big Bang Theory,57,10
24065,Sheldon,15," Well, if Amy's too busy, that gives the rest of you an opportunity to make my life easier, thus assuring yourselves a footnote in my memoirs, tentatively entitled You're Welcome, Mankind. All right, then, just shout when you hear the task you want to undertake. Uh, dentist. Okay, we can circle back to that one. Um, well, who wants to take me Wednesday morning to get new heels put on my dress shoes? Anyone? Oh. That one had hoot written all over it. Um, all right, uh, dermatologist? Allergist? Podiatrist? Supercuts? Okay, okay, here's a fun one. Um, I need a new picture frame and I have a hankering for Swedish meatballs. Who wants to spend the day with me at IKEA?",5,Big Bang Theory,672,122
24066,Raj,15, Their meatballs are pretty good.,5,Big Bang Theory,33,5
24067,Sheldon,15, What's that?,5,Big Bang Theory,13,2
24068,Raj,15," Nothing, nothing.",5,Big Bang Theory,18,2
24070,Sheldon,15," Hello, Stuart.",5,Big Bang Theory,15,2
24072,Sheldon,15," No, no. I was just sitting at home thinking about how it might be nice to catch up with my ninth favourite person.",5,Big Bang Theory,115,23
24074,Sheldon,15," You moved up one. My pen pal in Somalia was kidnapped by pirates. So, uh, how are you?",5,Big Bang Theory,87,18
24076,Sheldon,15," Great. Great. So, what's new with your family? How's your mother? Is she alive?",5,Big Bang Theory,80,14
24078,Sheldon,15, And your father? Alive?,5,Big Bang Theory,24,4
24080,Sheldon,15," How about your grandparents, they alive?",5,Big Bang Theory,41,6
24082,Sheldon,15," Oh, I'm so sorry for your loss. On a cheerier note, I have a teeth-cleaning appointment this afternoon. What do you say you take me over there, buddy boy?",5,Big Bang Theory,155,29
24084,Sheldon,15," Yes. And now, I can't make any promises, but that's the sort of thing that gets a fella on the short list for the number eight friend slot.",5,Big Bang Theory,140,28
24086,Sheldon,15," Can't help a friend out in a time of need, huh? I see where your therapist was coming from.",5,Big Bang Theory,92,19
24088,Raj,15," Ooh, ooh! What about we make your astronaut nickname Howard â€œBuzzâ€ù Wolowitz?",5,Big Bang Theory,81,12
24089,Howard,15, You can't do Buzz. Buzz is taken.,5,Big Bang Theory,34,7
24090,Raj,15, Buzz Lightyear is not real.,5,Big Bang Theory,28,5
24091,Howard,15," No, that's not what I'm talking about.",5,Big Bang Theory,39,7
24092,Raj,15," Well, are you talking about when he thought he was real?",5,Big Bang Theory,57,11
24093,Howard,15, No.,5,Big Bang Theory,4,1
24094,Raj,15," Okay, um, how about Crashâ€ù? Howard â€œCrashâ€ù Wolowitz.",5,Big Bang Theory,59,8
24095,Howard,15," Yeah, terrific. The other astronauts would love to go hurtling through space with a guy named Crash.",5,Big Bang Theory,101,17
24096,Raj,15," All right, um, how about, oh, how about Rocket Man?",5,Big Bang Theory,52,10
24097,Leonard,15," That's not bad, Howard â€œRocket Manâ€ù Wolowitz.",5,Big Bang Theory,50,7
24098,Howard,15," Yeah, it's great, but I told you, I don't get to pick my nickname. It has to come from the other astronauts.",5,Big Bang Theory,109,22
24099,Raj,15, Maybe there's a way to get them to come up with it.,5,Big Bang Theory,52,12
24100,Howard,15, Like how?,5,Big Bang Theory,10,2
24101,Leonard,15," Once I tried carrying around a Duncan yo-yo, hoping the other kids would start calling me Duncan.",5,Big Bang Theory,98,17
24102,Howard,15, Did it work?,5,Big Bang Theory,13,3
24103,Leonard,15," No, they ended up calling me Sock Mouth. Because they took away my yo-yo and stuffed their socks in my mouth.",5,Big Bang Theory,110,21
24104,Raj,15," Okay, uh, what if we make Rocket Man your ringtone, and the next time you talk to those guys, I'll call you and they'll hear it. Plant the seed.",5,Big Bang Theory,145,29
24105,Howard,15, That's actually not a terrible plan.,5,Big Bang Theory,37,6
24106,Raj,15, They don't call me Brown Dynamite for nothing.,5,Big Bang Theory,47,8
24107,Leonard,15, â€˜Sup?,5,Big Bang Theory,8,1
24108,Sheldon,15, â€˜Sup?,5,Big Bang Theory,8,1
24109,Leonard,15," Hey, did you ever make it to the dentist?",5,Big Bang Theory,42,9
24110,Sheldon,15," Not necessary. No. I found a service that'll send a van to your house for a teeth cleaning. Mostly they cater to dogs, but the fellow on the phone seemed to have an open mind.",5,Big Bang Theory,176,35
24111,Leonard,15," All right, Sheldon, if you need me to take you to the dentist, I will take you to the dentist.",5,Big Bang Theory,95,20
24112,Sheldon,15, Are you suggesting that you've come to your senses and wish to re-establish the mutual benefits that stem from full participation in the roommate agreement?,5,Big Bang Theory,157,25
24113,Leonard,15, Absolutely. If you admit that you're a 30-year-old man who's incapable of functioning on his own.,5,Big Bang Theory,98,16
24114,Raj,15," Ooh, Sock Mouth's got him on the ropes.",5,Big Bang Theory,40,8
24115,Sheldon,15," I will admit nothing of the sort. And now if you'll excuse me, I have to call my dentist and see if I can also get my hair shampooed and my nails clipped.",5,Big Bang Theory,155,33
24117,Penny,15," Oh, good, your power's out, too.",5,Big Bang Theory,33,6
24118,Leonard,15, Why is that good?,5,Big Bang Theory,18,4
24119,Penny,15," Because last month, I sent the electric company a Starbucks gift card, an apology note, and a few snapshots of me in a bra.",5,Big Bang Theory,124,24
24120,Sheldon,15, Power failure. Implementing power-failure protocol.,5,Big Bang Theory,52,5
24121,Leonard,15, What happened to all your glow-in-the-dark-emergency-exit stuff you had painted on the floor?,5,Big Bang Theory,94,13
24122,Sheldon,15," Oh, that was wildly carcinogenic. Anyway, it's too bad you're no longer entitled to the full benefits of my friendship, because I happen to be extremely prepared for such an emergency. Please try not to see anything by this light. It's not for you.",5,Big Bang Theory,249,44
24123,Leonard,15," It's just a blackout, I'm sure the power will be back on soon.",5,Big Bang Theory,63,13
24124,Sheldon,15, And I'm sure some fool in the Donner party said the snow would stop any day now. I like to think they ate him first.,5,Big Bang Theory,117,25
24125,Penny,15," You know, I got some candles in my apartment.",5,Big Bang Theory,46,9
24126,Sheldon,15," But candles? During a blackout? Are you mad? That's a fire hazard. No, Pasadena Water and Power recommends the far safer glow stick.",5,Big Bang Theory,133,23
24127,Leonard,15," You call that a glow stick? That is a glow stick. Come on, let's go.",5,Big Bang Theory,69,15
24128,Sheldon,15," Before you go, consider this. Not only do I have a deep-cycle marine battery power source which is more than capable of running our entertainment system, I also have all 61 episodes of the BBC series Red Dwarf and Fiddle-Faddle. All yours if you're willing to reinstate the roommate agreement.",5,Big Bang Theory,294,50
24129,Penny,15, I've got wine at my place and some bubble wrap we could pop.,5,Big Bang Theory,61,13
24130,Sheldon,15," Oh, he'll be back. Wine and a girl in the dark, he's gonna be bored out of his mind.",5,Big Bang Theory,85,19
24132,Leonard,15, To wine and bubble wrap. And to not having to watch Sheldon demonstrate his reverse osmosis machine that converts urine into drinking water.,5,Big Bang Theory,141,23
24133,Penny,15," You know, in Girl Scouts, Tammie Dinisha said you could do that with panty hose. Boy, was she wrong. Anyway, you want to make out?",5,Big Bang Theory,131,25
24134,Leonard,15," I thought because our relationship's in a beta test, you wanted to take things slow.",5,Big Bang Theory,85,15
24135,Penny,15, Okay. Do you want to make out slow?,5,Big Bang Theory,36,8
24136,Leonard,15, I can go so slow it'll be like there's a snail in your mouth.,5,Big Bang Theory,62,14
24137,Penny,15," Ugh. Well, lucky for you, there's nothing else to do right now.",5,Big Bang Theory,64,12
24138,Sheldon,15," Excuse me, Leonard.",5,Big Bang Theory,20,3
24139,Leonard,15, Since when don't you knock? It's like the only good thing about you.,5,Big Bang Theory,69,13
24140,Sheldon,15," Social niceties have been suspended, Leonard. We're in a state of a emergency. The world has descended into darkened turmoil. Lawlessness and savagery are the order of the day.",5,Big Bang Theory,177,29
24141,Leonard,15," Fine, what is it?",5,Big Bang Theory,18,4
24142,Sheldon,15, I'm making s'mores. I wanted to alert you in case you smelled caramelizing marshmallows and thought a nearby candy factory was on fire.,5,Big Bang Theory,136,23
24143,Leonard,15," S'mores, huh? Good for you.",5,Big Bang Theory,28,5
24144,Sheldon,15," Yes, or good for us if you sign here and reinstate the full roommate agreement.",5,Big Bang Theory,80,15
24145,Leonard,15," No, thanks. I'm good.",5,Big Bang Theory,22,4
24146,Sheldon,15," Really? Huh! Okay. In that case, I will have a s'more by myself. And then I'm gonna have s'more. By myself.",5,Big Bang Theory,108,21
24147,Penny,15, Aw.,5,Big Bang Theory,4,1
24148,Leonard,15," No, don't aw him. He brought this all on himself.",5,Big Bang Theory,50,10
24149,Penny,15, But he's sad.,5,Big Bang Theory,14,3
24150,Leonard,15," No, he's crazy. Sometimes crazy looks like sad so it'll suck you back in.",5,Big Bang Theory,74,14
24151,Penny,15, I think he misses his little buddy.,5,Big Bang Theory,36,7
24152,Leonard,15," Fine. But mark my words, this frustrating, bogus teenage make-out session is not over.",5,Big Bang Theory,87,14
24154,Leonard,15, I thought you said candles were dangerous.,5,Big Bang Theory,43,7
24155,Sheldon,15," This is a Bunsen burner. I'm a scientist, I know what I'm doing. Oh, drat.  Aw. It took me a gallon of urine to make that water.",5,Big Bang Theory,129,27
24156,Leonard,15," Listen, Sheldon, this is stupid. I don't see why we can't be friends. And I'm willing to drive you around and help you out with stuff. I just don't want to do it because of some silly roommate agreement.",5,Big Bang Theory,204,39
24157,Sheldon,15, What are you proposing?,5,Big Bang Theory,24,4
24158,Leonard,15," That we go back to the way things were. But when I do something for you, you show a little appreciation.",5,Big Bang Theory,105,21
24159,Sheldon,15, And how would I do that?,5,Big Bang Theory,25,6
24160,Leonard,15, You say thank you.,5,Big Bang Theory,19,4
24161,Sheldon,15, Every time?,5,Big Bang Theory,12,2
24162,Leonard,15, It's not crazy.,5,Big Bang Theory,16,3
24163,Sheldon,15," Counter-proposal. We reinstate the full roommate agreement with the following addendum, in the spirit of Mother's Day or Father's Day, once a year, we set aside day to celebrate all your contributions to my life, both actual and imagined by you. We could call it Leonard's Day.",5,Big Bang Theory,278,47
24164,Leonard,15, I kind of like the sound of that.,5,Big Bang Theory,34,8
24165,Sheldon,15," Of course you do. It's about you, like everything else.  Oh, thank goodness. I don't think I had it in me to make another glass of water.",5,Big Bang Theory,138,27
24166,Leonard,15," So, do I get breakfast in bed on Leonard's Day?",5,Big Bang Theory,48,10
24167,Sheldon,15, No.,5,Big Bang Theory,4,1
24168,Leonard,15, Can I sit in your spot?,5,Big Bang Theory,24,6
24169,Sheldon,15, No.,5,Big Bang Theory,4,1
24170,Leonard,15, Can I control the thermostat?,5,Big Bang Theory,30,5
24171,Sheldon,15, No.,5,Big Bang Theory,4,1
24172,Leonard,15, Do I get a card?,5,Big Bang Theory,17,5
24173,Sheldon,15, Of course you get a card. It's Leonard's Day.,5,Big Bang Theory,46,9
24174,Penny,15," Hey, guys, the building manager said the reason the power went out is someone went down into the basement and just pulled the main breaker switch.",5,Big Bang Theory,147,26
24175,Leonard,15," Really. Who do you think did that, Sheldon?",5,Big Bang Theory,44,8
24176,Sheldon,15," Oh, I don't know. But whoever that mystery man was, you should be eternally grateful, for without him, there would be no Leonard's Day.",5,Big Bang Theory,136,24
24177,Penny,15, Leonard's Day?,5,Big Bang Theory,15,2
24178,Sheldon,15," Oh, no pressure. Just get him a crummy card, you're good.",5,Big Bang Theory,58,11
24180,Howard,15," All right, test my ring tone. That really is a good song.",5,Big Bang Theory,58,12
24181,Raj,15," Oh, yeah. There's a reason he's Sir Elton John. They don't make you a knight for writing Wake Me Up Before You Go Go.",5,Big Bang Theory,118,24
24183,Howard,15," Ma, I told you I have a video conference with NASA. I said don't bother me!",5,Big Bang Theory,76,16
24185,Howard,15," Yes, please listen to Mr. Big Shot Astronaut. Hey, good morning.",5,Big Bang Theory,65,11
24187,Howard,15," No problem, Dr. Massimino.",5,Big Bang Theory,27,4
24189,Howard,15, Mass. That's a cool nickname. â€˜Cause force equals mass times acceleration.,5,Big Bang Theory,77,11
24191,Howard,15, Sorry. My phone.,5,Big Bang Theory,17,3
24193,Howard,15," Yeah, my ring tone. Kind of my favourite song, Rocket Man.",5,Big Bang Theory,59,11
24195,Howard,15, Not now!,5,Big Bang Theory,9,2
24197,Howard,15, My mom. Sorry.,5,Big Bang Theory,15,3
24198,Howard,15," No problem, Fruit Loops.",5,Big Bang Theory,25,4
24200,Sheldon,16," Gentlemen, I think I've come up with a fun way to get young people interested in science. Physics Mad-Libs. Now, give me a number.",5,Big Bang Theory,131,24
24201,Leonard,16, Five.,5,Big Bang Theory,6,1
24202,Sheldon,16, Uh-huh. And an irrational constant.,5,Big Bang Theory,36,5
24203,Howard,16, E.,5,Big Bang Theory,3,1
24204,Sheldon,16, And a funny Greek letter.,5,Big Bang Theory,26,5
24205,Raj,16, Gamma.,5,Big Bang Theory,7,1
24206,Sheldon,16, I said funny.,5,Big Bang Theory,14,3
24207,Raj,16, Upsilon?,5,Big Bang Theory,9,1
24208,Sheldon,16, Good one. And an electrical charge.,5,Big Bang Theory,36,6
24209,Leonard,16, Positive.,5,Big Bang Theory,10,1
24210,Sheldon,16," Ha. Perfect. Okay. Get this. Professor Jones told the symposium he had a new method for calculating the mass of a muon. Five times the limit of E to the upsilon as in a . Okay. No, no. I'll start over. Professor ",5,Big Bang Theory,213,42
24211,Howard,16, I haven't seen him laugh that hard since the day Leonard made that multiplication error.,5,Big Bang Theory,89,15
24212,Sheldon,16," Oh, Oh, Lord, that multiplication error! He thought he carried the one. But he didn't.",5,Big Bang Theory,87,15
24213,Leonard,16, It's not funny. That mistake got published.,5,Big Bang Theory,44,7
24214,Sheldon,16, Stop! I'm going to wet myself!,5,Big Bang Theory,31,6
24215,Raj,16," Hey, guys, guys, President Siebert is headed this way.",5,Big Bang Theory,55,9
24216,Howard,16, I wonder what he wants.,5,Big Bang Theory,24,5
24217,Leonard,16," Doesn't look happy, so I'm guessing he wants to talk to Sheldon.",5,Big Bang Theory,65,12
24219,Leonard,16, Told ya.,5,Big Bang Theory,9,2
24220,Sheldon,16," Oh, President Siebert, I assume you'd like to respond to one of the suggestions I put in the box by your office.",5,Big Bang Theory,113,22
24222,Sheldon,16," You don't like written suggestions. You don't like when I give them to you while we're urinating in the men's room. If I didn't know any better, I'd say that you're one of those stubborn people who are not open to suggestions.",5,Big Bang Theory,227,42
24224,Sheldon,16, I don't need a vacation.,5,Big Bang Theory,25,5
24226,Sheldon,16," But if I don't come into work, what am I supposed to do with myself?",5,Big Bang Theory,69,15
24228,Sheldon,16, Sarcasm?,5,Big Bang Theory,9,1
24229,Howard,16, No. You should go.,5,Big Bang Theory,19,4
24231,Leonard,16," That tonight's gonna be a good night, and tonight's gonna be a good night, and tonight's gonna be a good, good night! Tonight's the night, uh, uh, let's live it up, uh, I got my money, let's spend it up",5,Big Bang Theory,203,40
24232,Sheldon,16, Good Lord! Would you stop that caterwauling!,5,Big Bang Theory,45,7
24233,Leonard,16, What the hell are you doing?,5,Big Bang Theory,29,6
24234,Sheldon,16, Bleeding from my ears.,5,Big Bang Theory,23,4
24235,Leonard,16, What are you doing hiding back there?,5,Big Bang Theory,38,7
24236,Sheldon,16," I'm sneaking into work. Now, if the guard at the university asks what's under the blanket, you tell him it's some lobster traps.",5,Big Bang Theory,129,23
24237,Leonard,16, Lobster traps?,5,Big Bang Theory,15,2
24238,Sheldon,16, Yes. That's how Velma and Scooby smuggled Shaggy into the old lighthouse.,5,Big Bang Theory,74,12
24239,Leonard,16, What are you going to do when you get to the university? People are going to recognize you.,5,Big Bang Theory,92,18
24240,Sheldon,16," Will they, Leonard? ",5,Big Bang Theory,21,3
24241,Leonard,16," Fine. Just get back under your blanket, and I'll drive you there.",5,Big Bang Theory,66,12
24242,Sheldon,16, And no more singing.,5,Big Bang Theory,21,4
24243,Leonard,16, Fine.,5,Big Bang Theory,6,1
24244,Sheldon,16, I have GPS on my phone. I know you turned around.,5,Big Bang Theory,50,11
24246,Penny,16, I'm so glad you talked Howard out of having your wedding invitations in Klingon.,5,Big Bang Theory,81,14
24248,Amy,16," This is really happening. I'm gonna be a maid of honour. I'm gonna wear a beautiful dress and walk down that aisle and, finally, I will have my special day.",5,Big Bang Theory,157,30
24250,Amy,16, They're gonna need an extra-large veil for somebody's head.,5,Big Bang Theory,60,9
24252,Penny,16, Why wouldn't you?,5,Big Bang Theory,18,3
24254,Penny,16, Ouch.,5,Big Bang Theory,6,1
24256,Amy,16," Parental pressure can be daunting. I remember the battle with my mother about shaving my legs. Last year, I finally gave in and let her do it.",5,Big Bang Theory,143,27
24258,Penny,16," You know, I'm a big believer in breaking bad news to a guy when you're in bed with him. That's how I told my high school boyfriend I slept with his brother. That's how I told his brother the same thing.",5,Big Bang Theory,203,41
24260,Penny,16," Oh, sweetie, that's what sex is for.",5,Big Bang Theory,37,7
24261,Amy,16," You know, the connection between marriage and money is nothing new. In fact, the term wed referred to the money and livestock that the groom paid the bride's father. For example, you're adorable, intelligent and a good earner. I could conservatively see you going for at least two oxen and a goose.  You would fetch a unicorn.",5,Big Bang Theory,327,57
24263,Leonard,16," Sheldon, there are a million great vacations you could take. What about Hawaii?",5,Big Bang Theory,80,13
24264,Sheldon,16," Hawaii is a former leper colony on top of an active volcano where the disappointing ending to Lost was filmed. Mahalo for nothing, Hawaii.",5,Big Bang Theory,139,24
24265,Howard,16," How about Florida? They've got Cape Canaveral, they've got Disney, they've got my Aunt Ida and the world's largest collection of diabetic candy. Plus, if you get sweaty enough, her plastic-covered furniture is like a flume ride.",5,Big Bang Theory,229,37
24266,Sheldon,16, My family took a trip to Florida when I was a child. A seagull stole a hot dog from me on the beach. I got the message.,5,Big Bang Theory,120,27
24267,Raj,16," You know, if I had a week off, I'd go back to the Two Bunch Palms Resort and Spa in the desert. I tell you, an hour on the massage table with Trevor, and you'll feel like you were born without bones.",5,Big Bang Theory,200,42
24268,Howard,16, I don't think I could ever let a guy give me a massage.,5,Big Bang Theory,56,13
24269,Raj,16, Really? What was I doing to your neck last night while you were playing X-Box?,5,Big Bang Theory,79,15
24270,Sheldon,16," It's like I'm living in a dictatorship. You must take a vacation, you must have fun, you must enjoy life.",5,Big Bang Theory,106,20
24271,Howard,16, I don't think you have a good handle on dictatorships.,5,Big Bang Theory,55,10
24272,Leonard,16," Sheldon, everybody takes vacations.",5,Big Bang Theory,36,4
24273,Sheldon,16," One time they tried to make Richard Feynman take a vacation, but he chose instead to expand his mind and learn something new. He went to work in his friend's biology lab. Richard Feynman was a famous American physicist, part of the Manhattan Project.",5,Big Bang Theory,251,44
24274,Howard,16, Everyone in the world of science knows who Richard Feynman was.,5,Big Bang Theory,64,11
24275,Sheldon,16," Now you do, too. Oh! I have a brilliant idea. Amy's a biologist. I'll go work in her lab.",5,Big Bang Theory,90,19
24276,Howard,16, Isn't that just Feynman's idea?,5,Big Bang Theory,32,5
24277,Sheldon,16," Ten seconds ago, you never heard of him. Now you're an expert.",5,Big Bang Theory,63,12
24279,Leonard,16, Hey.,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
24280,Penny,16," Hey, you.",5,Big Bang Theory,10,2
24281,Leonard,16," Is that your laundry? You only have, like, six things in there.",5,Big Bang Theory,64,12
24282,Penny,16," Yeah, I didn't have any quarters, so I've been sneaking stuff into other people's loads all day. Hey, if I tell you something, will you promise not to tell anybody?",5,Big Bang Theory,165,30
24283,Leonard,16," It doesn't matter what I say, you're gonna tell me anyway.",5,Big Bang Theory,59,11
24284,Penny,16, What? That is not true. Bernadette wants a pre-nup.,5,Big Bang Theory,52,9
24285,Leonard,16, Wow. That's rough.,5,Big Bang Theory,19,3
24286,Penny,16," So you're saying if I became a famous movie star, we got married, you wouldn't sign a pre-nup?",5,Big Bang Theory,95,18
24287,Leonard,16," Absolutely not. If I'm gonna be stuck at home with the kids while you're on location cheating on me with Ryan Gosling, then Leonard gots to get paid. So, you think about us getting married?",5,Big Bang Theory,190,35
24288,Penny,16," I think about a lot of things. I think about us getting married, I think about us breaking up. Once in a while, I think about how I didn't leave a note on that Mercedes I dinged in the parking lot last month, but then I have a glass of wine and it passes.",5,Big Bang Theory,256,54
24289,Leonard,16," Joke all you want, but you think about it.",5,Big Bang Theory,43,9
24290,Penny,16," Well, tell you one thing, if I ever do get married, no Klingon invitations.",5,Big Bang Theory,76,14
24291,Leonard,16, Good luck catching a man with that attitude.,5,Big Bang Theory,45,8
24293,Sheldon,16," Boy, oh, boy. This vacation is off to a wonderful start. The smell of formaldehyde, the whir of the centrifuge, the distant chatter of lab animals being dispatched for dissection. Mm, I can already feel my cares just melting away.",5,Big Bang Theory,231,40
24294,Amy,16, I'm excited to work with my boyfriend. It's gonna be romantic.,5,Big Bang Theory,63,11
24295,Sheldon,16, Way to kill the mood.,5,Big Bang Theory,22,5
24296,Amy,16," Come on, Sheldon. We can be like Marie Curie and her husband, Pierre, who spent their days working side by side, bathed in the glow of their love and the radium that ultimately killed her. Screw Beauty and the Beast, that's the love story Disney should tell.",5,Big Bang Theory,259,47
24297,Sheldon,16," Okay, what do we start with? Maybe splicing some genes, clone a sheep, perhaps grow a human ear on a mouse's back? Ha-ha, I'm a freak!",5,Big Bang Theory,135,26
24298,Amy,16," Oh, I'm gonna be doing some brain stem histology while you put yourself on the business end of a sponge and wash those beakers.",5,Big Bang Theory,128,24
24299,Sheldon,16," Wash those bea Oh, I get it, a little hazing for the new fella. Yeah, I'd better keep and eye out for, what, shoe polish on the microscope, or mad cow disease in my grilled cheese sandwich?",5,Big Bang Theory,190,37
24300,Amy,16," No, I just need those beakers washed. Hippity-hop, quick like a bunny.",5,Big Bang Theory,71,12
24301,Sheldon,16," What? Excuse me, you have Dr. Sheldon Cooper in your lab. You're gonna make him do the dishes? That's like asking the Incredible Hulk to open a pickle jar.",5,Big Bang Theory,156,29
24302,Amy,16," Sheldon, you've never worked in a lab like this before. You have no experience in the field of biology.",5,Big Bang Theory,104,19
24303,Sheldon,16, I have plenty of experience in biology. I bought a Tamagotchi in 1998. And it's still alive. Let's do this.,5,Big Bang Theory,108,20
24305,Leonard,16, Where's Howard?,5,Big Bang Theory,16,2
24306,Raj,16," No hi, Raj? No how are you, Raj? Just straight to where's the other white guy?",5,Big Bang Theory,79,16
24307,Leonard,16," I'm sorry. So, listen, I heard something about him. Can you keep it between us?",5,Big Bang Theory,80,15
24308,Raj,16," Ooh, gossip. When I first got here, I thought you Americans really gossiped around the water cooler. So I hung out there for, like, a month, but the only gossip I ever heard was about some creepy guy hanging out by the water cooler.",5,Big Bang Theory,233,44
24309,Leonard,16, Bernadette wants to get a pre-nup.,5,Big Bang Theory,35,6
24310,Raj,16," Oh, that's a shame, he's gonna be devastated.",5,Big Bang Theory,46,8
24311,Leonard,16, I never know what to do in these situations. Should I give him a heads-up?,5,Big Bang Theory,75,15
24312,Raj,16, Hmm. I'm gonna give you the same advice I yell at the TV when the Bachelor's handing out roses. Follow your heart.,5,Big Bang Theory,115,22
24313,Howard,16, Check it out. Look at the size of that Rice Krispie Treat. Same price.,5,Big Bang Theory,71,14
24314,Leonard,16," Hey, Howard, I need to tell you something.",5,Big Bang Theory,43,8
24315,Howard,16," I know, it's not on my wedding diet. I don't care.",5,Big Bang Theory,51,11
24316,Leonard,16," Uh, listen, I heard that Bernadette's thinking about asking you for a pre-nup.",5,Big Bang Theory,79,13
24317,Howard,16, A pre-nup? Wow.,5,Big Bang Theory,16,3
24318,Leonard,16, What are you gonna do?,5,Big Bang Theory,23,5
24319,Howard,16, I don't know.,5,Big Bang Theory,14,3
24320,Raj,16, Follow your heart.,5,Big Bang Theory,19,3
24321,Howard,16," You know what, it's not a big deal. She makes more money than me. She wants to protect her financial interests. It's completely reasonable.",5,Big Bang Theory,140,24
24322,Howard,16," Yeah, actually, it's good for both of us. I have assets to protect, too.",5,Big Bang Theory,73,14
24323,Raj,16, Like what?,5,Big Bang Theory,11,2
24324,Howard,16, I've got some rare comic books. The Vespa's almost paid off. And Ma and I have a primo double cemetery plot at Mt. Sinai right near the guy who played Mr. Roper on Three's Company.,5,Big Bang Theory,181,35
24325,Raj,16, Mr. Roper's dead? You can't just spring that on a guy.,5,Big Bang Theory,55,11
24327,Sheldon,16, Here you go. This is now the only lab with glassware washed by a man with two doctorates and a restraining order signed by Carl Sagan.,5,Big Bang Theory,135,26
24328,Amy,16, Soap spots. Wash 'em again.,5,Big Bang Theory,28,5
24329,Sheldon,16, Y-you're being ridiculous. Those are perfectly clean.,5,Big Bang Theory,54,7
24330,Amy,16," Sheldon, this beaker used to contain cerebral spinal fluid from an elephant that died of syphilis. If it's, in fact, perfectly clean, drink from it.",5,Big Bang Theory,149,25
24331,Sheldon,16, Biologists are mean.,5,Big Bang Theory,21,3
24332,Amy,16," All right, perhaps this task will be a little bit more up your alley. I need you to count the bacteria spores on these petri dishes.",5,Big Bang Theory,133,26
24333,Sheldon,16, There was something wrong with that detergent. That was way too bubbly.,5,Big Bang Theory,72,12
24334,Amy,16, I'm sure it was.,5,Big Bang Theory,17,4
24335,Sheldon,16, I intend to write that soap company a strongly worded letter.,5,Big Bang Theory,62,11
24336,Amy,16," Yeah, good for you. Now, start counting.",5,Big Bang Theory,41,7
24337,Sheldon,16, You know what this place needs? A suggestion box.,5,Big Bang Theory,50,9
24338,Sheldon,16, 366 367,5,Big Bang Theory,8,2
24339,Amy,16, How's it going?,5,Big Bang Theory,16,3
24340,Sheldon,16," How's counting going? When I was in kindergarten, I recited pi to a thousand places for the school talent show. I think I got this.",5,Big Bang Theory,132,25
24341,Amy,16, Great.,5,Big Bang Theory,7,1
24342,Sheldon,16," Aw, nuts! One",5,Big Bang Theory,14,3
24343,Sheldon,16," This is preposterous. I think you're giving me these tasks because you're afraid if you give me anything meaningful to do, I'll show you up.",5,Big Bang Theory,141,25
24344,Amy,16, Really? Is that what you think?,5,Big Bang Theory,32,6
24345,Sheldon,16," Yes, that's what I think. And I'm super smart, so it's probably true.",5,Big Bang Theory,70,13
24346,Amy,16," Hey, I've been training in the field of neurobiology for 12 years. You've been here for three hours, and you've spent one of them in the bathroom.",5,Big Bang Theory,147,27
24347,Sheldon,16, I'm sorry. It takes me a while to get things going on an unfamiliar toilet.,5,Big Bang Theory,76,15
24348,Amy,16," Sheldon, I've given you the simplest things to do, and you haven't done one of them right.",5,Big Bang Theory,91,17
24349,Sheldon,16, Maybe that's because I'm not being challenged. It's the same reason Einstein failed math.,5,Big Bang Theory,90,14
24350,Amy,16, Maybe the math was too bubbly for him.,5,Big Bang Theory,39,8
24351,Sheldon,16," You think you're doing science by cutting up that brain? They could do the same thing at any Quiznos. And they'd offer to toast it for me, too.",5,Big Bang Theory,144,28
24352,Amy,16," Okay, smart guy. I'm about to remove the locus coeruleus, which is incredibly delicate work. Have at it.",5,Big Bang Theory,105,18
24353,Sheldon,16, All right. I'm no stranger to a little gray matter. Locus coeruleus. Locus coeruleus.,5,Big Bang Theory,86,14
24354,Amy,16," You're getting warmer, it is, indeed, in the brain. Hope your hands are steady. It's the width of a single hair. But this is just biology, so I'm sure it's no problem for a genius like you.",5,Big Bang Theory,190,37
24355,Sheldon,16," It's not. I'll have you know, in the field of physics, we work with particles so small, they make fat jokes about the locus coeruleus, i.e., when your locus coeruleus sits around the house, it sits around the house.",5,Big Bang Theory,216,39
24356,Amy,16," Oh, are we nervous, Dr. Cooper?",5,Big Bang Theory,32,6
24357,Sheldon,16, No. What you see is a man trembling with confidence. Does a locus coeruleus normally bleed that much?,5,Big Bang Theory,102,18
24358,Amy,16, No. But your thumb does.,5,Big Bang Theory,25,5
24359,Sheldon,16," Oh, dear. ",5,Big Bang Theory,11,2
24360,Amy,16," Yeah, you're a biologist.",5,Big Bang Theory,26,4
24362,Howard,16, What are you doing here?,5,Big Bang Theory,25,5
24363,Sheldon,16, I'm on vacation. Social convention dictates that I let my hair down at a local watering hole. Social convention is stupid.,5,Big Bang Theory,123,21
24364,Howard,16, What happened to your thumb?,5,Big Bang Theory,29,5
24365,Sheldon,16," You know, I have ten fingers and ten toes. If I tell you a story about each one of them, we'll be here all day, let's just move on.",5,Big Bang Theory,132,29
24367,Sheldon,16," Ah, seeing as I'm on vacation, a pina colada seems appropriate. Extra pineapple slices, extra whipped cream, extra cherries, extra umbrellas, and, uh, hold the rum. Don't let me have too many of those.",5,Big Bang Theory,202,34
24368,Penny,16," Hey, what are you guys doing here?",5,Big Bang Theory,35,7
24369,Howard,16," We're grown men, we drink at bars.",5,Big Bang Theory,35,7
24370,Penny,16, No and no. Everything okay with you and Bernadette?,5,Big Bang Theory,52,9
24371,Howard,16," Oh, yeah, sure.",5,Big Bang Theory,16,3
24372,Penny,16, You and Amy? Good?,5,Big Bang Theory,19,4
24373,Sheldon,16," Oh, better than good.",5,Big Bang Theory,22,4
24374,Penny,16, You know those girls text me every detail of their lives as it happens.,5,Big Bang Theory,72,14
24375,Howard,16, I'm not signing a pre-nup.,5,Big Bang Theory,27,5
24376,Penny,16," All right, Howard Wolowitz, listen up. You sign anything she puts in front of you, because you are the luckiest man alive. If you let her go, there is no way you can find anyone else. Speaking on behalf of all women, it is not gonna happen, we had a meeting. And you, a grown man fainting at the sight of a little blood.",5,Big Bang Theory,321,64
24377,Sheldon,16," Excuse me, this is a fairly substantial wound. ",5,Big Bang Theory,48,8
24379,Sheldon,16,  Amy?  Amy?  Amy?,5,Big Bang Theory,18,3
24380,Amy,16, What do you want?,5,Big Bang Theory,18,4
24381,Sheldon,16," I was kind of hoping I could continue vacationing in your laboratory. After all, I did book the whole week.",5,Big Bang Theory,108,20
24382,Amy,16, Do you honestly think you can just waltz back in here after the way you behaved yesterday?,5,Big Bang Theory,91,17
24383,Sheldon,16, I was not myself. I had lost a lot of thumb blood.,5,Big Bang Theory,51,12
24384,Amy,16, That's not an apology.,5,Big Bang Theory,23,4
24385,Sheldon,16, That is your opinion.,5,Big Bang Theory,22,4
24386,Amy,16, I want a real apology.,5,Big Bang Theory,23,5
24387,Sheldon,16, I'm sorry that you weren't able to,5,Big Bang Theory,35,7
24388,Amy,16, No.,5,Big Bang Theory,4,1
24389,Sheldon,16, That my genius,5,Big Bang Theory,15,3
24390,Amy,16, No.,5,Big Bang Theory,4,1
24391,Sheldon,16, That the soap was,5,Big Bang Theory,18,4
24392,Amy,16, Sheldon.,5,Big Bang Theory,9,1
24393,Sheldon,16, Fine. Sorry.,5,Big Bang Theory,13,2
24394,Amy,16," You're forgiven. Now, if you want to stay, get started on those beakers. They're still dirty from yesterday.",5,Big Bang Theory,109,18
24395,Sheldon,16, Next year I'm going to Epcot.,5,Big Bang Theory,30,6
24398,Howard,16," No. I'm not mad at you. I just wish you would have come to me, so I didn't have to hear it through the nerd-vine.",5,Big Bang Theory,114,25
24400,Howard,16, You really want me to sign a pre-nup?,5,Big Bang Theory,38,8
24402,Howard,16," Why don't I talk to your dad, man-to-man?",5,Big Bang Theory,42,8
24404,Howard,16, Done.,5,Big Bang Theory,6,1
24406,Howard,16, Okay.,5,Big Bang Theory,6,1
24408,Howard,16," Got it, got it. Will you e-mail me that list?",5,Big Bang Theory,46,10
24410,Howard,16," You know, this isn't that pressing. Why don't I talk to him about it in May.",5,Big Bang Theory,77,16
24412,Howard,16, They've got a phone.,5,Big Bang Theory,21,4
24414,Raj,17, It was a nice retirement party.,5,Big Bang Theory,32,6
24415,Howard,17," I guess. Still, it's a shame Professor Rothman was forced to step down.",5,Big Bang Theory,72,13
24416,Leonard,17, What choice did the university have? He snapped. It happens to theoretical physicists all the time.,5,Big Bang Theory,100,16
24417,Howard,17, I wonder how long Sheldon's got.,5,Big Bang Theory,33,6
24418,Sheldon,17, These shrimp are all the same size. There's no the logical order to eat them in.,5,Big Bang Theory,81,16
24419,Leonard,17, Can't be very long.,5,Big Bang Theory,20,4
24420,Raj,17," Hey, look, there's Rothman's empty office. Sad.",5,Big Bang Theory,48,7
24421,Leonard,17, Yeah.,5,Big Bang Theory,6,1
24422,Sheldon,17," Mm, indeed.",5,Big Bang Theory,12,2
24423,Howard,17, So sad.,5,Big Bang Theory,8,2
24424,Sheldon,17, Dibs.,5,Big Bang Theory,6,1
24426,Sheldon,17," What are you doing here, Kripke?",5,Big Bang Theory,33,6
24428,Sheldon,17, This is not your office. It hasn't been assigned yet.,5,Big Bang Theory,54,10
24430,Sheldon,17," Dibs? This is a university, not a playground. Offices are not assigned because someone called dibs.",5,Big Bang Theory,100,16
24431,Leonard,17, You just called dibs.,5,Big Bang Theory,22,4
24432,Sheldon,17, Shut it. Offices are assigned by seniority. I arrived at the university first.,5,Big Bang Theory,79,13
24438,Raj,17, I'm glad that men are wearing hats again. They're so distinguished.,5,Big Bang Theory,68,11
24440,Amy,17, I got you a little something.,5,Big Bang Theory,30,6
24441,Penny,17," A little something? Oh, it what, this is huge.",5,Big Bang Theory,47,9
24442,Amy,17, What's huge is what you've done for me.,5,Big Bang Theory,40,8
24443,Penny,17," Oh, no, Amy, I haven't done anything.",5,Big Bang Theory,38,7
24444,Amy,17," No, no, before I met you, I was a mousy wallflower. But look at me now. I'm like some kind of downtown hipster party girl. With a posse, a boyfriend and a new lace bra that hooks in the front, of all things. Open it. Open it.",5,Big Bang Theory,226,47
24445,Penny,17, Okay. ,5,Big Bang Theory,7,1
24446,Amy,17, I wanted to get you something you didn't have.,5,Big Bang Theory,47,9
24447,Penny,17, Wow. I-I don't know what to s Wow.,5,Big Bang Theory,35,8
24448,Amy,17, Do you like it?,5,Big Bang Theory,16,4
24449,Penny,17, Do I like it? Wow.,5,Big Bang Theory,19,5
24450,Amy,17," So, uh, where are you gonna hang it?",5,Big Bang Theory,37,8
24451,Penny,17," Oh, my God. Hang it. Wow. Um, you know, I'd have to go get a hook and nails and a hammer and",5,Big Bang Theory,93,22
24452,Amy,17, No problem.,5,Big Bang Theory,12,2
24453,Penny,17," Oh, look. You, huh, you just, you got it all right there. Wow.",5,Big Bang Theory,63,13
24455,Sheldon,17, I found him. He's in the bathroom. President Siebert?,5,Big Bang Theory,54,9
24457,Sheldon,17, I'm sorry. We just need a word.,5,Big Bang Theory,32,7
24463,Sheldon,17, We tried. His assistant said he was on sabbatical. Although we distinctly heard his office window open and shut.,5,Big Bang Theory,113,19
24465,Sheldon,17," Oh, my. President Siebert, I don't mean to be an alarmist, but difficulty initiating a urine stream could be a symptom of benign prostatic hyperplasia. If you're interested, I can send you a link to a YouTube video that'll show you how to perform your own rectal exam. Yeah, uh, helpful hint, trim your nails first.",5,Big Bang Theory,316,56
24467,Sheldon,17," Oh, he's just trying to butter you up. And for the record, butter is an excellent lubricant for your rectal exam.",5,Big Bang Theory,114,21
24470,Sheldon,17, Kripke?,5,Big Bang Theory,8,1
24472,Sheldon,17, You're in my spot.,5,Big Bang Theory,19,4
24475,Penny,17, So big.,5,Big Bang Theory,8,2
24477,Penny,17, So ugly. What am I gonna do?,5,Big Bang Theory,29,7
24479,Penny,17, Is there any chance I'll learn to love it?,5,Big Bang Theory,43,9
24481,Penny,17," All right, it's got to go.",5,Big Bang Theory,27,6
24483,Penny,17, How about I tell her the painting makes you feel jealous because you're not in it?,5,Big Bang Theory,83,16
24485,Penny,17," Well, I guess I could take it down and put it up when she comes over, but it's kind of heavy.",5,Big Bang Theory,94,21
24488,Raj,17," Would you look at this? I paid twenty five dollars to some kid on eBay for a handcrafted Harry Potter wand. He sent me a stick. He went into his backyard, he picked up a stick.",5,Big Bang Theory,177,36
24489,Howard,17, It's numbered.,5,Big Bang Theory,15,2
24490,Raj,17," Ooh, limited edition. Nice.",5,Big Bang Theory,28,4
24491,Sheldon,17," Oh, that'll be Kripke.",5,Big Bang Theory,23,4
24492,Leonard,17, What's he doing here?,5,Big Bang Theory,22,4
24493,Sheldon,17," We're going to work this office situation out like gentlemen. And if that doesn't work, I'm going to poison his tea.",5,Big Bang Theory,117,21
24495,Sheldon,17, Kripke. Come in. I'm making tea. Would you like a cup?,5,Big Bang Theory,55,11
24497,Sheldon,17, Fine. In the interest of preserving our friendship,5,Big Bang Theory,51,8
24499,Sheldon,17," Well, that's a little hard to hear, but all right. As you know, the essence of diplomacy is compromise. With that in mind, I propose the following. I will take Rothman's office, and you will find a way to be okay with that.",5,Big Bang Theory,224,43
24501,Sheldon,17, You sure I can't get you that cup of tea?,5,Big Bang Theory,42,10
24502,Raj,17, How about you decide this with Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock?,5,Big Bang Theory,65,7
24504,Sheldon,17, Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock was created by Internet pioneer Sam Kass as an improvement on the classic game Rock-Paper-Scissors. All hail Sam Kass.,5,Big Bang Theory,152,20
24507,Sheldon,17," Oh, it's very simple. Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors.",5,Big Bang Theory,267,39
24509,Sheldon,17," Well, of course. Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors.",5,Big Bang Theory,262,38
24511,Sheldon,17," Surely. Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock",5,Big Bang Theory,53,8
24512,Howard,17," Sheldon, stop. He's screwing with you.",5,Big Bang Theory,39,6
24513,Sheldon,17," Is he? Well, then, it seems we have reached an impasse. I see no other option than to challenge you to a duel. I'd smack you with a glove, but just last week I packed away my winter things.",5,Big Bang Theory,190,39
24514,Howard,17, It's the 21st century. You can't have a duel.,5,Big Bang Theory,46,9
24515,Leonard,17," H-h-h-hang on, Howard. Barry, how good of a shot are you?",5,Big Bang Theory,58,11
24517,Leonard,17, It's gonna be hard to find something you're both equally good at.,5,Big Bang Theory,66,12
24518,Raj,17, Is there anything you're both equally bad at?,5,Big Bang Theory,46,8
24521,Leonard,17," All right, this is one-on-one. First person to five wins the office. Any questions? Yes, Sheldon?",5,Big Bang Theory,98,16
24522,Sheldon,17, Five what?,5,Big Bang Theory,11,2
24523,Leonard,17, Balls in the basket. ,5,Big Bang Theory,22,4
24524,Sheldon,17, Ew!,5,Big Bang Theory,4,1
24527,Leonard,17, You know all those terrible things bullies used to do to us?,5,Big Bang Theory,61,12
24528,Raj,17, Yeah.,5,Big Bang Theory,6,1
24529,Leonard,17, I get it.,5,Big Bang Theory,10,3
24530,Sheldon,17," Hey! He did that on purpose,",5,Big Bang Theory,29,6
24531,Leonard,17," No, he didn't. Nothing that's happening here is being done on purpose. Okay, uh, forget one-on-one. Let's try a free throw contest. First person who makes a basket wins the office.",5,Big Bang Theory,181,31
24533,Leonard,17," No. No, I'm not.",5,Big Bang Theory,17,4
24534,Sheldon,17," Use the force, Sheldon. Use the force.  I'm gonna need more force.",5,Big Bang Theory,67,12
24536,Leonard,17," All right, we gave it 45 minutes. It's no longer funny. Let's try something else.",5,Big Bang Theory,82,15
24537,Sheldon,17, What do you propose?,5,Big Bang Theory,21,4
24538,Leonard,17," Uh, on the count of three, both of you bounce the balls as hard as you can. The highest bounce wins the office.",5,Big Bang Theory,112,23
24540,Sheldon,17," I don't think so, Kripke. I've bounced many a rubber ball in my day.",5,Big Bang Theory,69,14
24541,Leonard,17," All right, that's enough trash talk. One, two, three.",5,Big Bang Theory,54,9
24542,Howard,17, Sheldon was higher.,5,Big Bang Theory,20,3
24543,Leonard,17," Congratulations, Sheldon. You win office.",5,Big Bang Theory,42,5
24544,Sheldon,17, Who's unsatisfactory in P.E. now?,5,Big Bang Theory,34,5
24546,Amy,17," Oh, what a great movie.",5,Big Bang Theory,24,5
24547,Penny,17, I cannot believe you've never seen Grease.,5,Big Bang Theory,43,7
24548,Amy,17, My mother didn't allow me to watch it. She was afraid it might encourage me to join a gang.,5,Big Bang Theory,92,19
24550,Amy,17," I guess I should get going, too. Good night, painting Penny. Good night, real Penny.",5,Big Bang Theory,85,15
24551,Penny,17," Good night, real Amy.",5,Big Bang Theory,22,4
24552,Amy,17," You don't have to say good night to painting Amy, 'cause she's never leaving.",5,Big Bang Theory,78,14
24554,Penny,17, Bye.,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
24556,Penny,17," Ah, okay. Let us take you off the wall. Out of sight, out of mind. I wish.",5,Big Bang Theory,75,17
24557,Amy,17," You know, can I borrow that movie? Those singing hooligans really got my motor running.",5,Big Bang Theory,88,15
24558,Penny,17," Sure, sure. Enjoy. I mean, get it back to me when you can, or, you know what, actually, you keep it. It's just going to be my gift to you. Bye.",5,Big Bang Theory,144,31
24559,Amy,17, Thank you. Wait. Where'd the painting go?,5,Big Bang Theory,42,7
24560,Penny,17, It's right over there.,5,Big Bang Theory,23,4
24561,Amy,17, Why?,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
24562,Penny,17, I have no idea. That is weird.,5,Big Bang Theory,31,7
24563,Amy,17, You hate it.,5,Big Bang Theory,13,3
24564,Penny,17," No. No, no. It's just, it's a little big.",5,Big Bang Theory,42,9
24565,Amy,17, I feel like an idiot.,5,Big Bang Theory,22,5
24566,Penny,17," No, come on, you're not an idiot. Look, just help me put it back up.",5,Big Bang Theory,69,15
24567,Amy,17, Why? So you can just take it down when I leave? I don't need your pity.,5,Big Bang Theory,72,16
24568,Penny,17," Oh, Amy, come on.",5,Big Bang Theory,18,4
24569,Amy,17, I'm just glad I didn't go for the sculpture.,5,Big Bang Theory,45,9
24571,Sheldon,17," Ah, the spoils. I see why victors love them.",5,Big Bang Theory,45,9
24572,Raj,17," I'm happy for you, Sheldon. But I have to admit I'm going to miss sharing an office with you.",5,Big Bang Theory,94,19
24573,Sheldon,17," Oh, of course you are. Feel free to drop by any time.",5,Big Bang Theory,54,12
24574,Raj,17, Thank you.,5,Big Bang Theory,11,2
24575,Sheldon,17, Yeah. Call first. ,5,Big Bang Theory,19,3
24577,Sheldon,17, Professor Rothman. This isn't your office any more. You're retired.,5,Big Bang Theory,68,10
24580,Penny,17, I came to say I'm sorry.,5,Big Bang Theory,25,6
24581,Amy,17, Don't bother.,5,Big Bang Theory,14,2
24582,Penny,17," Oh, Amy, please.",5,Big Bang Theory,17,3
24583,Amy,17," I'm so humiliated. I sat there the whole time that we were watching Grease, thinking you liked the painting.",5,Big Bang Theory,109,19
24584,Penny,17, I know.,5,Big Bang Theory,8,2
24585,Amy,17, I was a fool from Summer Lovin' to the very last rama lama lama ke ding a de dinga a dong.,5,Big Bang Theory,91,21
24586,Penny,17, You're right. You're absolutely right. I should have been honest with you and told you the gift was too much.,5,Big Bang Theory,110,20
24587,Amy,17," Yes, too much. Because our friendship is fundamentally asymmetrical. I clearly like you more than you like me.",5,Big Bang Theory,111,18
24588,Penny,17, I don't think you can put a number on how much one person likes another.,5,Big Bang Theory,73,15
24589,Amy,17, I bought you a painting that's 12 square feet in area. There's a number.,5,Big Bang Theory,73,14
24590,Penny,17," Amy, come on",5,Big Bang Theory,13,3
24591,Amy,17," If you don't like feet, you can try dollars. The painting set me back three grand.",5,Big Bang Theory,83,16
24592,Penny,17," Three gr Oh, my God! Look, look, Amy, all you need to know is, you are my friend and I don't want to lose you out of my life.",5,Big Bang Theory,126,29
24593,Amy,17," I'm sorry, I'm just having trouble believing you right now.",5,Big Bang Theory,60,10
24594,Penny,17, Grab your hammer.,5,Big Bang Theory,18,3
24595,Amy,17, No. Damage is done.,5,Big Bang Theory,20,4
24596,Penny,17," Okay, look, I didn't want to say this, but the real reason I took the painting down was because it made Bernadette very jealous.",5,Big Bang Theory,129,24
24597,Amy,17," Oh, my goodness, how could I have not seen that? The painting is a constant reminder that of the three of us, she is the least cool.",5,Big Bang Theory,133,27
24598,Penny,17," Yeah, th-th-th-that's what it is, so",5,Big Bang Theory,37,6
24599,Amy,17, You have such a good heart.,5,Big Bang Theory,28,6
24600,Penny,17," Huh, I try.",5,Big Bang Theory,12,3
24601,Amy,17, Come on.,5,Big Bang Theory,9,2
24602,Penny,17, Well where are we going?,5,Big Bang Theory,25,5
24603,Amy,17, We're going to go put this painting back up in your apartment.,5,Big Bang Theory,63,12
24604,Penny,17," Well, what about Bernadette?",5,Big Bang Theory,29,4
24605,Amy,17," Oh, screw her. She's just lucky we let her hang out with us.",5,Big Bang Theory,61,13
24607,Leonard,17, What are you doing?,5,Big Bang Theory,20,4
24608,Sheldon,17, I'm trying to raise the temperature in here before my nipples tear through my shirt.,5,Big Bang Theory,85,15
24609,Howard,17, Why don't you just turn up the thermostat?,5,Big Bang Theory,43,8
24610,Sheldon,17," Aha! Good question. It turns out the thermostat for my new office isn't in my new office. No. It's next door, in Professor Davenport's office, who is currently enjoying the hot flashes associated with menopause.",5,Big Bang Theory,212,35
24611,Leonard,17, Why is there a hole here?,5,Big Bang Theory,26,6
24612,Raj,17," Well, at least you finally got a window that opens. That's nice.",5,Big Bang Theory,65,12
24613,Sheldon,17, Is it? Listen.,5,Big Bang Theory,15,3
24614,Raj,17," What, you don't like wind chimes?",5,Big Bang Theory,34,6
24615,Sheldon,17," No, I hate them, but it gets worse. There it is.",5,Big Bang Theory,49,11
24616,Howard,17, The bird?,5,Big Bang Theory,10,2
24617,Sheldon,17," Yeah, It's completely out of tune with the wind chimes.",5,Big Bang Theory,56,10
24618,Raj,17, So?,5,Big Bang Theory,4,1
24619,Sheldon,17," You don't get it, do you? That's a mockingbird. Mockingbirds can change their song, which means he's out of tune on purpose. He's mocking me. Oh dear. There it is again. Do you feel it?",5,Big Bang Theory,186,35
24620,Howard,17, The growing realization that you are one wacky bastard? Yep.,5,Big Bang Theory,61,10
24621,Sheldon,17," No. The vibration. We are directly underneath the geology lab, and they're running their confounded sieve shakers again. Hey, gravel monkeys, if you need to shake rocks, try jiggling your heads around!",5,Big Bang Theory,202,32
24622,Leonard,17," Sheldon, relax.",5,Big Bang Theory,16,2
24623,Sheldon,17, How can I relax? My nervous system is being stretched out like the strings of a harp and plucked by holes and birds and wind and the low-hanging scrotum of the difficult-to-evict Professor Rothman.,5,Big Bang Theory,198,34
24624,Leonard,17," If you're not happy, why don't you just let Kripke have the office?",5,Big Bang Theory,68,13
24625,Sheldon,17," What, and let him win? Do I look crazy to you? We're trying to think down here, you geode-loving feldspar jockeys!  And you, the notes are C, D, E, G and A. You pick one or I am chopping down that tree!",5,Big Bang Theory,203,42
24627,Penny,17, How's that?,5,Big Bang Theory,12,2
24628,Amy,17, Little higher on the right.,5,Big Bang Theory,28,5
24629,Penny,17, Now?,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
24630,Amy,17, Little more. No. That's got it.,5,Big Bang Theory,32,6
24631,Penny,17," Yeah, okay. That's, uh, that's good.",5,Big Bang Theory,37,6
24632,Amy,17, I'll let you in on a little secret.,5,Big Bang Theory,36,8
24633,Penny,17, Mm.,5,Big Bang Theory,4,1
24634,Amy,17," Originally we were painted nude. But I had him add clothes, 'cause I thought it was an unnecessary challenge to our heterosexuality.",5,Big Bang Theory,133,22
24635,Penny,17," Yeah, good call.",5,Big Bang Theory,17,3
24636,Amy,17," But if you ever change your mind, all it would take is some warm, soapy water and a couple of sponges.",5,Big Bang Theory,103,21
24637,Penny,17," You're talking about the painting, right?",5,Big Bang Theory,42,6
24638,Amy,17, Sure.,5,Big Bang Theory,6,1
24640,Sheldon,17, Help! Somebody help!,5,Big Bang Theory,21,3
24641,Leonard,17, What happened?,5,Big Bang Theory,15,2
24642,Sheldon,17, I was trying to see what was in here and my head got stuck.,5,Big Bang Theory,60,14
24643,Leonard,17, Why would you do that?,5,Big Bang Theory,23,5
24644,Sheldon,17, It's called scientific curiosity. Now go get butter.,5,Big Bang Theory,53,8
24645,Leonard,17, Hang in there. I'll be right back. ,5,Big Bang Theory,36,7
24647,Leonard,18, I'm just gonna run to the store and get a few things. I'll pick you up when you're done.,5,Big Bang Theory,89,19
24648,Sheldon,18," Okay. I like it a little better when you stay, but all right.",5,Big Bang Theory,62,13
24650,Sheldon,18, Hello. I'm here for my haircut with Mr. D'Onofrio.,5,Big Bang Theory,51,9
24652,Sheldon,18," Oh, dear, Mr. D'Onofrio's in the hospital. Why do these things always happen to me?",5,Big Bang Theory,84,15
24654,Sheldon,18, You're not Mr. D'Onofrio. I get my hair cut by Mr. D'Onofrio. You believe this guy?,5,Big Bang Theory,84,16
24655,Leonard,18," Excuse us for a second. Sheldon, it's okay, he can do it. He's a barber.",5,Big Bang Theory,73,15
24656,Sheldon,18," He's not a barber, he's the nephew. He's an example of the kind of nepotism that runs rampant in the barbering industry. Besides, Mr. D'Onofrio knows exactly how I like my hair done because he has all my haircut records from my barber in Texas.",5,Big Bang Theory,245,45
24657,Leonard,18, What are you talking about?,5,Big Bang Theory,28,5
24658,Sheldon,18," When I first moved here I was nervous about finding a new barber, so my mother had all my haircut records sent here to Mr. D'Onofrio.",5,Big Bang Theory,134,26
24659,Leonard,18, There's no such thing as haircut records.,5,Big Bang Theory,42,7
24660,Sheldon,18," Yes, there are.",5,Big Bang Theory,16,3
24661,Leonard,18, Have you ever seen them?,5,Big Bang Theory,25,5
24662,Sheldon,18," No, but my mother assured me they were sent here, and I'll bet you dollars to doughnuts that this one doesn't have them. Uh, excuse me. Do you have access to my haircut records?",5,Big Bang Theory,178,34
24664,Sheldon,18," To paraphrase T.S. Eliot, this is the way the world ends, not with a bang but with a nephew.",5,Big Bang Theory,93,19
24665,Leonard,18," Sheldon, you're a grown man, he's a professional, and your haircut is number three on that poster from 1946. Just sit down and let him do it.",5,Big Bang Theory,142,27
24666,Sheldon,18," Fine, but if I come out of this looking like a dork, it's on you. ",5,Big Bang Theory,67,15
24668,Sheldon,18, Nope. ,5,Big Bang Theory,7,1
24669,Leonard,18," When you tell this story later, the word we usually use is quirky.",5,Big Bang Theory,67,13
24671,Sheldon,18, Can you pass the Parmesan cheese?,5,Big Bang Theory,34,6
24672,Leonard,18, Sure. What are you doing?,5,Big Bang Theory,26,5
24673,Sheldon,18, I'm trying to get the hair out of my eyes.,5,Big Bang Theory,43,10
24674,Leonard,18," Sheldon, you are one day late for your haircut.",5,Big Bang Theory,48,9
24675,Sheldon,18, Thank you for captioning my nightmare.,5,Big Bang Theory,39,6
24676,Howard,18," Lookie here, I got my travel orders.",5,Big Bang Theory,37,7
24677,Raj,18," Payload Specialist Howard Wolowitz is requested to report to the NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas, for astronaut training Monday eight a.m.",5,Big Bang Theory,149,22
24678,Howard,18," Yeah, but it's from NASA, so it's oh eight hundred.",5,Big Bang Theory,52,10
24679,Raj,18, But it says eight a.m.,5,Big Bang Theory,23,5
24680,Howard,18, You read it as oh eight hundred.,5,Big Bang Theory,33,7
24681,Raj,18, It doesn't have an oh in front of it.,5,Big Bang Theory,38,9
24682,Howard,18," You know what does have an oh in front of it? Oh, my God, I'm an astronaut, and you're dying of jealousy.",5,Big Bang Theory,106,22
24683,Leonard,18," So, what kind of things are they  will you stop that?",5,Big Bang Theory,54,11
24684,Sheldon,18," I can't help it, I feel like a teen heartthrob.",5,Big Bang Theory,48,10
24685,Penny,18," You know, Sheldon, I used to cut my brother's hair. I could do it for you.",5,Big Bang Theory,75,16
24686,Sheldon,18," Penny, I know you mean well, offering the skills of the hill folk, but, um, here in town we don't churn our own butter, we don't, uh, make dresses out of gunny sacks, and, uh, we sure as shootin' don't get our hair cut by bottle-blonde",5,Big Bang Theory,236,46
24687,Leonard,18," Sheldon, be nice.",5,Big Bang Theory,18,3
24688,Sheldon,18," I'm sorry, it's the bad boy attitude that comes with this hair.",5,Big Bang Theory,64,12
24689,Raj,18," You could go to my guy. He's at Juan-Juan in Beverly Hills. They bring you a cup of tea, they'll massage your scalp. It's about two hundred dollars, but sometimes you look in the next chair and you see a superstar like Tony Danza.",5,Big Bang Theory,231,44
24690,Howard,18," Quick question here, have we actually changed the conversation from I'm going",5,Big Bang Theory,78,12
24691,Raj,18," Now who's dying of jealousy? Oh, it's you.",5,Big Bang Theory,43,8
24693,Amy,18," I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride. I'm wanted I'm wanted wanted, dead or alive. Sheldon, you're ruining girlfriend-boyfriend sing-along night.",5,Big Bang Theory,147,23
24694,Sheldon,18," I'm sorry. I'm looking for a barber and I'm running out of time. My hair is growing at the rate of 4.6 yoctometers per femtosecond. I mean, if you're quiet, you can hear it.",5,Big Bang Theory,174,34
24695,Amy,18, What about Supercuts?,5,Big Bang Theory,22,3
24696,Sheldon,18, I tried once. They do men's and women's hair in the same room at the same time. It's like Sodom and Gomorrah with mousse.,5,Big Bang Theory,122,24
24697,Amy,18," Well, this isn't a crisis. Why don't you just let your hair grow out a little?",5,Big Bang Theory,79,16
24698,Sheldon,18," Why don't I let my hair grow out? Um, why don't I start wearing Birkenstocks and, uh, uh, seeking validation of my opinions by asking can you dig it?",5,Big Bang Theory,150,29
24699,Amy,18," Well, I don't know. I think you might look sexy with long hair. The kind that flows down to your shoulders and blows back while riding on a horse, bareback and bare-chested. I'm gonna go brush my teeth, it might take a while.",5,Big Bang Theory,226,43
24701,Howard,18, Hi.,5,Big Bang Theory,4,1
24703,Howard,18, I miss you.,5,Big Bang Theory,12,3
24705,Howard,18," Oh, wow, where do I even start? I got to experience zero gravity.",5,Big Bang Theory,66,13
24707,Howard,18," It's pretty neat. You get in this plane that goes almost straight up for, like, 20 seconds, and then straight back down like it's going to crash, and they do it over and over again, you know, no matter how many times you throw up.",5,Big Bang Theory,231,45
24709,Howard,18," Yeah, and the craziest part is, because there's no gravity, the throw-up kind of floats there, in a little ball, and if your mouth is open because you're screaming, sometimes it just floats right back in. Boy, does everyone laugh at you when that happens.",5,Big Bang Theory,256,45
24711,Howard,18," No. Yeah, I would have laughed, too, but I didn't want the vomit to come back out. Anyway, oh, could you do me a favour and overnight me some more underwear?",5,Big Bang Theory,158,31
24713,Howard,18," I got a look at the centrifuge they're going to spin me around in tomorrow, and I have a hunch I packed a little light.",5,Big Bang Theory,120,25
24715,Sheldon,18," Mr. D'Onofrio? It's Sheldon. They didn't have anything barber-themed in the gift shop, so I got you this. I don't know if you can read his little T-shirt. It says, um, get well bear-y soon. Trust me, if you were even a little conscious right now, you'd be laughing. Anyway, there's new studies that show, people in comas are aware of everything going on around them. With that in mind, if you can hear me, move away from the light and toward the sound of these scissors.",5,Big Bang Theory,471,87
24717,Sheldon,18, Yes. Do you have something I could use as a cape?,5,Big Bang Theory,50,11
24719,Sheldon,18," Oh, no, no, I'm just here to get my hair cut.",5,Big Bang Theory,46,11
24721,Sheldon,18," I got to run. But not with scissors, that would be unsafe.",5,Big Bang Theory,59,12
24723,Penny,18," So, if I move my horsey here, isn't that checkmate and I win?",5,Big Bang Theory,62,13
24724,Leonard,18, Hmm.,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
24725,Penny,18," Well, is it or isn't it?",5,Big Bang Theory,25,6
24726,Leonard,18," You know, I think this is a good stopping point. Uh, it's your first real game. I threw a lot of information at you.",5,Big Bang Theory,117,24
24727,Penny,18," Well, no, I mean, your king is trapped. He can't go here because of my lighthouse, and he can't go here because of my pointy-head guy.",5,Big Bang Theory,135,26
24728,Leonard,18," Like I said, complicated game.",5,Big Bang Theory,31,5
24729,Penny,18, So did I win or not?,5,Big Bang Theory,21,6
24730,Leonard,18," Did you have fun? Because if you had fun, then you are, you are a winner. Now that's, that-that's what chess is all about.",5,Big Bang Theory,123,24
24731,Sheldon,18, Hello.,5,Big Bang Theory,7,1
24732,Leonard,18, Hey.,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
24733,Penny,18," Oh, hey. Sorry, Sheldon, I'll move.",5,Big Bang Theory,36,6
24734,Sheldon,18," Eh, why? My spot, your spot, what difference does it make?",5,Big Bang Theory,59,11
24735,Penny,18," Okay, what just happened?",5,Big Bang Theory,26,4
24736,Leonard,18," I don't know. Between you playing chess like Bobby Fischer and Sheldon being okay with you in his spot, I'm guessing someone went back in time, stepped on a bug, and changed the course of human events.",5,Big Bang Theory,202,37
24737,Penny,18," Uh, sweetie, are you all right?",5,Big Bang Theory,32,6
24738,Sheldon,18," No, I'm not all right. It's been six days since I was supposed to get a haircut and nothing horrible has happened.",5,Big Bang Theory,115,22
24739,Penny,18," Okay, I'm sorry, I don't understand.",5,Big Bang Theory,37,6
24740,Sheldon,18," Leonard, explain it to her.",5,Big Bang Theory,28,5
24741,Leonard,18," Oh, uh, he's crazy.",5,Big Bang Theory,20,4
24742,Sheldon,18," I have spent my whole life trying to bring order to the universe by carefully planning every moment of every day. But all my efforts, our dinner schedule, my pyjama rotation, my bowel movement spreadsheet, it's clear now, I've been wasting my time.",5,Big Bang Theory,249,43
24743,Leonard,18, Good. I'm taking that disgusting chart off the fridge.,5,Big Bang Theory,55,9
24744,Penny,18," You know, Sh-Sheldon, sometimes it's nice not knowing what's coming. I mean, look at me and Leonard. We went out, we broke up, now we're trying again. We don't know what's gonna happen.",5,Big Bang Theory,186,33
24745,Sheldon,18," Oh, please, everyone knows what's going to happen. But I see your point.",5,Big Bang Theory,73,13
24746,Leonard,18, I think this could be good for you. Maybe it's time for you to shake things up a bit.,5,Big Bang Theory,86,19
24747,Sheldon,18, You're right. I should embrace the chaos.,5,Big Bang Theory,42,7
24748,Leonard,18, Great. What are you going to do first?,5,Big Bang Theory,39,8
24749,Sheldon,18, I don't know. I could do anything. All bets are off. The world is my oyster. I got it. I'm going to put on my Tuesday pyjamas tonight.,5,Big Bang Theory,135,28
24750,Leonard,18," I got to tell you, I'm a little worried about him.",5,Big Bang Theory,51,11
24751,Penny,18," If I were you, I'd be worried that a girl who's never played chess in her life just kicked your ass.",5,Big Bang Theory,101,21
24753,Howard,18, Hi.,5,Big Bang Theory,4,1
24755,Howard,18," We did overnight survival training in the wilderness. Big fun. Big, big fun. I was gonna freshen up for you but I blacked out a little on the way to the bathroom.",5,Big Bang Theory,163,32
24757,Howard,18," Uh-huh. Except you don't have food or water, and they don't have a sunset Sabbath service like they do at Camp Hess-Kramer.",5,Big Bang Theory,124,22
24759,Howard,18," No. I slept in a hole I dug in the ground with my bare hands. And at some point during the night, an armadillo crawled in and spooned me.",5,Big Bang Theory,138,29
24761,Howard,18," But I did it. I survived. I wasn't sure I was going to when the sandstorm hit. I just pulled my turtleneck up over my head and waited for death. But somehow as I sat there, wrapped in a cocoon of my own neck-sweat, I found that primal part of the human spirit that just wants to keep on living, no matter what the cost.",5,Big Bang Theory,320,65
24763,Howard,18," I ate a butterfly. It was so small and beautiful, but I was so hungry.",5,Big Bang Theory,71,15
24765,Howard,18," No, I don't think it's possible. I'm severely dehydrated. My pee is like toothpaste.",5,Big Bang Theory,85,14
24767,Howard,18," Thanks, honey, but I can't quit. If I do, I'll just be a guy who had a chance to be an astronaut and gave it up.",5,Big Bang Theory,113,26
24769,Howard,18, No. Wait. Send more underwear.,5,Big Bang Theory,31,5
24771,Leonard,18, Don't let this be Sheldon playing bongos. Please don't let this be Sheldon playing bongos.,5,Big Bang Theory,91,15
24772,Sheldon,18," Hello, Leonard, do you like my bongos? Bet you didn't know that I had bongos.",5,Big Bang Theory,78,15
24773,Leonard,18," Sheldon, it's three o'clock in the morning.",5,Big Bang Theory,44,7
24774,Sheldon,18, Three in the morning is a good time for bongos.,5,Big Bang Theory,48,10
24775,Leonard,18, I was sleeping.,5,Big Bang Theory,16,3
24776,Sheldon,18, Leonard sleeps while I play bongos.,5,Big Bang Theory,36,6
24777,Leonard,18," No, he doesn't.",5,Big Bang Theory,16,3
24778,Sheldon,18, Leonard no sleep while I play bongos. Bongo solo.,5,Big Bang Theory,50,9
24779,Leonard,18, Stop! Stop it! Stop! Stop! Stop it!,5,Big Bang Theory,36,7
24780,Penny,18, What the hell?!,5,Big Bang Theory,16,3
24781,Leonard,18," Oh, hi, Penny, guess what? Sheldon got bongos.",5,Big Bang Theory,47,8
24782,Penny,18, Why did you get bongos?,5,Big Bang Theory,24,5
24783,Sheldon,18, Richard Feynman played the bongos. I thought I'd give that a try.,5,Big Bang Theory,66,12
24784,Leonard,18, Richard Feynman was a famous physicist.,5,Big Bang Theory,40,6
24785,Penny,18," Oh, Leonard, it's three o'clock in the morning. I don't care if Richard Feynman was a purple leprechaun who lived in my butt.",5,Big Bang Theory,126,23
24786,Sheldon,18, Penny meant if he were a purple leprechaun. Penny forgot to use the subjunctive.,5,Big Bang Theory,81,14
24787,Leonard,18," Sheldon, go to bed. You have work in the morning.",5,Big Bang Theory,50,10
24788,Sheldon,18," Maybe, maybe not. Maybe tomorrow I start a bongo band and tour the world.",5,Big Bang Theory,74,14
24789,Leonard,18," W-w-wuh, no, no, hang on,uh, uh, roommate agreement. No hootenannies, sing-a-longs, or barbershop quartets after ten p.m.",5,Big Bang Theory,122,17
24790,Sheldon,18, Roommate agreement? Are you kidding? We are living in a world of chaos. Roommate agreement.,5,Big Bang Theory,92,15
24791,Penny,18, Where are you going?,5,Big Bang Theory,21,4
24792,Sheldon,18," Wherever the music takes me, kitten. I play bongos walking down the stairs.  Oh! Oh! Never play bongos walking down the stairs.",5,Big Bang Theory,128,22
24795,Howard,18, What are you doing here?,5,Big Bang Theory,25,5
24797,Howard,18," Oh, I love you so much.",5,Big Bang Theory,24,6
24800,Howard,18," Don't worry, once she falls asleep, I'll spoon you like an armadillo.",5,Big Bang Theory,70,12
24802,Amy,18, He showed up in the middle of the night with his bongos. I foolishly thought it was some sort of musical booty call.,5,Big Bang Theory,117,23
24803,Leonard,18, Poor guy. He must have been exhausted. Sheldon like to sleep while Leonard play the bongo!,5,Big Bang Theory,91,16
24804,Amy,18, That was kind of uncalled for.,5,Big Bang Theory,31,6
24805,Leonard,18," No, it was called for.",5,Big Bang Theory,23,5
24806,Sheldon,18, What's going on?,5,Big Bang Theory,17,3
24807,Penny,18," All right, Sheldon, this craziness has gone on long enough. Please come home so I can cut your hair.",5,Big Bang Theory,101,19
24808,Sheldon,18," Penny, you're not trained. You're not licensed. Most importantly, you don't have access to my haircut records.",5,Big Bang Theory,111,17
24809,Penny,18," All right, honey, look, we've known each other for a long time now, right? I've taken you to Disneyland, I kicked a bully in the nuts for you, I sing you Soft Kitty when you're sick, you've even saw me naked once.",5,Big Bang Theory,214,42
24810,Leonard,18," I'm sorry, duh, what?",5,Big Bang Theory,22,4
24811,Penny,18," It was a long story. Anyway, Sheldon, I promise I know what I'm doing. Please let me cut your hair.",5,Big Bang Theory,100,20
24812,Sheldon,18," Amy, what do you think?",5,Big Bang Theory,24,5
24813,Amy,18, There's not a hair on my body I wouldn't let this woman trim.,5,Big Bang Theory,62,13
24814,Sheldon,18," Fine, let's go. Thank you for letting me sleep on your couch.",5,Big Bang Theory,62,12
24815,Amy,18, There's only so many times a woman can say how about the bed?,5,Big Bang Theory,62,13
24816,Leonard,18, What's this about Sheldon seeing you naked?,5,Big Bang Theory,44,7
24817,Sheldon,18," Oh, relax. It was just her bottom and her breasts.",5,Big Bang Theory,51,10
24819,Penny,18, Almost done.,5,Big Bang Theory,13,2
24820,Sheldon,18," At the end of the haircut, Mr. D'Onofrio would tell me a dirty joke.",5,Big Bang Theory,69,14
24821,Penny,18," Well, sorry, I don't know any dirty jokes.",5,Big Bang Theory,43,8
24822,Sheldon,18," That's okay, I never understood them anyway.",5,Big Bang Theory,45,7
24823,Penny,18," Okay, what do you think?",5,Big Bang Theory,25,5
24824,Sheldon,18," Hmm, well, it's a little Hollywood. But I think I can pull it off. Well done, Penny.",5,Big Bang Theory,85,17
24825,Penny,18," Ha, told you. Okay, I'm just gonna clean up your neck a little and then you are good to go.",5,Big Bang Theory,92,20
24826,Sheldon,18," Fun time. Hah. Sorry, sometimes the clippers tickle me.",5,Big Bang Theory,56,9
24827,Penny,18," Okay.  Okay, yep, we're all done now. It's just, it's good. Let me just take that away from you. Okay.",5,Big Bang Theory,103,20
24829,Penny,18," You are welcome. Yeah, I'm gonna have to move.",5,Big Bang Theory,47,9
24831,Raj,19," Hey, want to spend some time playing the new Star Wars game this weekend?",5,Big Bang Theory,74,14
24832,Leonard,19," Oh, I don't know. I kind of promised myself I'd get off the computer, be more physically active. Get some exercise.",5,Big Bang Theory,116,21
24833,Howard,19, You're about to walk up three flights of stairs.,5,Big Bang Theory,49,9
24834,Leonard,19," Good point, I'm in.",5,Big Bang Theory,20,4
24835,Raj,19, You know what would be great? Let's do it like the old days.,5,Big Bang Theory,61,13
24836,Leonard,19," You mean, are you talking gaming marathon?",5,Big Bang Theory,43,7
24837,Raj,19," Yeah. Start Saturday morning, go 48 hours, sleeping bags, junk food.",5,Big Bang Theory,69,11
24838,Howard,19, Turn off our phones so our moms can't call.,5,Big Bang Theory,44,9
24839,Leonard,19, It would be like our World Of Warcraft a few years ago when the neighbours called the cops on us.,5,Big Bang Theory,98,20
24840,Howard,19, They called the cops because of the smell. They thought we were dead.,5,Big Bang Theory,70,13
24841,Raj,19, We were badass back in the day.,5,Big Bang Theory,32,7
24842,Leonard,19," All right, let's do it.",5,Big Bang Theory,24,5
24843,Howard,19, 48 hours of Star Wars gaming.,5,Big Bang Theory,30,6
24844,Raj,19, It's on like Alderaan.,5,Big Bang Theory,23,4
24845,Leonard,19," Hey, Sheldon, clear your weekend. Starting Saturday morning, Star Wars< marathon",5,Big Bang Theory,81,11
24846,Raj,19, Woo-hoo!,5,Big Bang Theory,9,1
24847,Sheldon,19, Movies or video games? Or board game? Or trading card games? Or Lego's? Or dress up? Or comic books? Or dramatic readings of novelizations? Yes to all!,5,Big Bang Theory,152,27
24848,Leonard,19, We are going to play the online game.,5,Big Bang Theory,38,8
24849,Sheldon,19, The online game? Bully!,5,Big Bang Theory,24,4
24850,Amy,19," Gentlemen, as much as I'm sure Sheldon would enjoy playing intergalactic make-believe, he and I have other plans. We are attending my Aunt Flora's 93rd birthday party.",5,Big Bang Theory,168,27
24851,Sheldon,19, Just tell her I can't come.,5,Big Bang Theory,28,6
24852,Amy,19, She'll be disappointed if we don't show up.,5,Big Bang Theory,44,8
24853,Sheldon,19, She's 93. She won't be disappointed for very long.,5,Big Bang Theory,51,9
24854,Amy,19," No, hang on. I followed all the protocols set forth by you in the relationship agreement. I made a written record request 72 hours in advance. I checked the tyre pressure on the car. I even contacted the Centres For Disease Control to find out what shots they recommend for travel to Orange County. FYI, it's none.",5,Big Bang Theory,315,57
24855,Sheldon,19," Amy, the relationship agreement was not designed for either one of us to get our way.",5,Big Bang Theory,86,16
24856,Amy,19, You use it to get your way.,5,Big Bang Theory,28,7
24857,Sheldon,19, I use it to get the right way. The fact that the right way is also my way is a happy coincidence.,5,Big Bang Theory,98,22
24858,Amy,19, You gave me your word. You're coming with me.,5,Big Bang Theory,46,9
24859,Leonard,19," We'll miss you, Sheldon.",5,Big Bang Theory,25,4
24860,Sheldon,19," Yeah, well, who wants to spend the whole weekend, running around a bunch of pretend planets battling made up monsters. That's for babies.",5,Big Bang Theory,138,23
24861,Howard,19," Yeah, but it's got lightsabres.",5,Big Bang Theory,32,5
24862,Sheldon,19," Yeah, please, Amy! It's got lightsabres!",5,Big Bang Theory,41,6
24864,Sheldon,19, Hello Stuart.,5,Big Bang Theory,14,2
24866,Sheldon,19," Yes. I'm attending a party this weekend, for a 93-year-old woman. Can you recommend a gift?",5,Big Bang Theory,92,16
24868,Sheldon,19, Do you supply the the tennis ball?,5,Big Bang Theory,35,7
24870,Sheldon,19, Then no. What else?,5,Big Bang Theory,20,4
24872,Sheldon,19," Well, she'd just look silly wearing that without the rest of the costume.",5,Big Bang Theory,74,13
24874,Sheldon,19," Oh, it's not your fault. I've been to the model train store. I've been to Radio Shack. This woman is impossible to shop for.",5,Big Bang Theory,125,24
24875,Leonard,19, I'd make fun of Sheldon for having girl problems if I wasn't in shock that Sheldon has girl problems.,5,Big Bang Theory,102,19
24876,Sheldon,19," No, Leonard, go ahead and mock. Like my daddy always said, Shelly, women aren't anything but flippin' pains in the bottom.",5,Big Bang Theory,123,21
24877,Leonard,19, That's what your father used to say?,5,Big Bang Theory,37,7
24878,Sheldon,19," Well, I took out the bad words and the yeehaw, but you get the gist.",5,Big Bang Theory,69,15
24879,Howard,19," Look, if you don't want to go to the party, just don't go. You're a grown man. Act like one. Tell Amy you want to spend the weekend having a sleepover and playing video games with your friends. Maybe she'll dig it. Women like a firm hand on the tiller.",5,Big Bang Theory,253,50
24880,Raj,19, I can never find the tiller. I got a book; it didn't help.,5,Big Bang Theory,59,13
24881,Sheldon,19," Yeah, I always thought if I were ever enslaved, it would be by an advanced species from another planet, not some hotsy-totsy from Glendale.",5,Big Bang Theory,140,24
24882,Howard,19," Now, I downloaded an app that might be helpful in this situation. ",5,Big Bang Theory,67,12
24883,Sheldon,19, You're right. I'm smart as a whip. I should be able to figure this out.,5,Big Bang Theory,72,15
24885,Leonard,19," Hey, listen, I kind of made plans with the guys this weekend, but then I wondered, because we're in this relationship-beta-test, if I should have asked you first. Then I thought if I did check with you first, you'd think that I was taking things to seriously. And then, then I got a nosebleed.",5,Big Bang Theory,294,54
24886,Penny,19, You don't have to check with me. Do whatever you want.,5,Big Bang Theory,55,11
24887,Leonard,19," Oh. I guess I was hoping for a different reaction, but okay.",5,Big Bang Theory,61,12
24888,Penny,19," Really, what were you hoping for?",5,Big Bang Theory,34,6
24889,Leonard,19," I don't know, maybe that you'd be a little upset, and then you'd realize that I'm a stallion that has to run free. And that would turn you on a little.",5,Big Bang Theory,152,31
24890,Penny,19," Okay, I'm an actress. Ask me again.",5,Big Bang Theory,36,7
24891,Leonard,19, Do you mind if I spend the weekend playing video games with the guys?,5,Big Bang Theory,70,14
24892,Penny,19," Whu the entire weekend? You mean I wouldn't see you at all? But I ju No, no, I knew what I was getting into. You can't put a saddle on Leonard Hofstadter. Oh, my, is it getting hot in here? Ay, papi.",5,Big Bang Theory,200,42
24893,Leonard,19, Ay papi? What is that?,5,Big Bang Theory,23,5
24894,Penny,19, An acting choice.,5,Big Bang Theory,18,3
24895,Leonard,19," Oh. So you chose that when you become turned on, you turn into Speedy Gonzalez?",5,Big Bang Theory,80,15
24896,Penny,19," Choo got a problem with that, papi?",5,Big Bang Theory,36,7
24897,Leonard,19, Uh-uh.,5,Big Bang Theory,7,1
24898,Sheldon,19,  Penny!  Penny!  Penny!,5,Big Bang Theory,24,3
24899,Penny,19," Sorry, Stallion. Your weird friend Giraffe is here.",5,Big Bang Theory,52,8
24900,Sheldon,19," Hello, Penny. I just stopped by to bring you this gift.",5,Big Bang Theory,56,11
24901,Penny,19, Gummy bears? Thank you.,5,Big Bang Theory,24,4
24902,Sheldon,19," Now that you're in my debt, please manipulate Amy into releasing me from my commitment to attend her aunt's tedious birthday party.",5,Big Bang Theory,132,22
24903,Penny,19, Not a chance.,5,Big Bang Theory,14,3
24904,Sheldon,19," All right. I thought the candy might not be enough so let me up the ante. These are Cooper Coupons. These are for various things I can do for you. Um, oh, this one is for one free grammar check. Uh, you could use it for emails, letters, tattoos, what have you. Um, oh, this is fun one. This is an afternoon with me at the California Science Center, where I point out their mistakes.",5,Big Bang Theory,383,75
24905,Leonard,19," Keep an eye on those expiration dates, I've been burned more than once.",5,Big Bang Theory,72,13
24906,Penny,19," All right, sweetie, I'm not going to get involved in your relationship.",5,Big Bang Theory,72,12
24907,Sheldon,19," Oh, come on. It's just a simple favour. Now, when's the last time I asked you to do something for me?",5,Big Bang Theory,102,21
24908,Penny,19, Yesterday. You made me look in your ear to see if there was a ladybug in it.,5,Big Bang Theory,77,17
24909,Sheldon,19, When is the last time I asked you to do something that wasn't a medical emergency?,5,Big Bang Theory,83,16
24910,Penny,19, Yesterday. You made me look in your ear to see if there was a ladybug in it.,5,Big Bang Theory,77,17
24911,Sheldon,19," All right, then, I have no choice but to go on to plan B.",5,Big Bang Theory,58,14
24912,Penny,19, What's that?,5,Big Bang Theory,13,2
24913,Sheldon,19, I'm going to run around outside with a wet head and try to catch a cold.,5,Big Bang Theory,73,16
24915,Amy,19, Good morning.,5,Big Bang Theory,14,2
24916,Sheldon,19, Hello.,5,Big Bang Theory,7,1
24917,Amy,19," I think you're really going to enjoy yourself today. Not only do you get to meet my relatives, but since my aunt's nursing home is catering the party, all of the food is incredibly soft. It's like a vacation for your teeth.",5,Big Bang Theory,224,42
24918,Sheldon,19, All right.,5,Big Bang Theory,11,2
24919,Amy,19, You sure you're okay with this?,5,Big Bang Theory,32,6
24920,Sheldon,19, Yes. I decided to find a way that I could have this experience and enjoy it.,5,Big Bang Theory,77,16
24921,Amy,19, Thank you. That means a lot to me.,5,Big Bang Theory,35,8
24922,Sheldon,19," Oh, don't thank me. Thank wireless technology. I realized, I can go to your aunt's awful party and still spend the whole day gaming with my friends.",5,Big Bang Theory,149,27
24923,Amy,19," Sheldon, my relatives are going to want to talk to you, and you're going to be sitting there playing a game? Isn't that a little rude?",5,Big Bang Theory,135,26
24924,Sheldon,19," Oh, I got that covered. Headset. I won't hear a word the old geezers are saying.",5,Big Bang Theory,81,16
24925,Amy,19," You know, if playing that game is more important to you than honouring your commitment to me, and you don't mind me showing up at a party all by myself after I've already told everybody I'll be bringing somebody, then, fine. Go home and play your game.",5,Big Bang Theory,253,47
24926,Sheldon,19," Thanks. Ooh, listen, I wouldn't mind a piece of birthday cake, provided the old gal's candle blow is clean and dry.",5,Big Bang Theory,116,21
24928,Raj,19," Here you go. I've got everything we'll need for the big game. Low fat turkey jerky, low-carb beer, 100-calorie snack packs.",5,Big Bang Theory,124,21
24929,Leonard,19, You pick up a Y chromosome while you were there? You might be short one.,5,Big Bang Theory,73,15
24930,Raj,19," Hey, I plan on levelling up in the game, not my swimsuit size, thank you very much.",5,Big Bang Theory,84,17
24931,Sheldon,19," Gentlemen, the game offers us a choice between playing for the Republic and the light side, or the Sith Empire and the dark side.",5,Big Bang Theory,130,24
24932,Leonard,19," Well, we're always the good guys. In D&D, we're lawful good, in City Of Heroes, we're the heroes, in Grand Theft Auto, we pay the prostitutes promptly and never hit them with a bat.",5,Big Bang Theory,182,34
24933,Sheldon,19, Those women are prostitutes? You said they were raising money for stem cell research.,5,Big Bang Theory,86,14
24934,Howard,19," Hey, guys, I got a surprise.",5,Big Bang Theory,29,6
24935,Leonard,19," Uh, if it's yoghurt that helps ladies poop, I think Raj beat you to it.",5,Big Bang Theory,72,15
24936,Howard,19," No. Bernadette's going to be playing with us. So, that's pretty cool, huh? Right? Sure it is, yeah.",5,Big Bang Theory,100,18
24937,Raj,19," What, you invited your girlfriend? This is supposed to be our weekend.",5,Big Bang Theory,71,12
24938,Howard,19," I had no choice. Last night, she said, why don't we go out for brunch tomorrow and then maybe the Arboretum. And I said, well, no, I promised the guys I was going to play a video game with them all weekend. And she said, that sounds like fun, can I come, too? And then I didn't answer for a second, and then she said, well, do you not want me to come? And then I bought her a new laptop and the game, and she's parking the car right now.",5,Big Bang Theory,438,91
24939,Sheldon,19, Is the whip sound app contextually appropriate here?,5,Big Bang Theory,53,8
24940,Leonard,19," Uh, it is, but I think you might've waited too long for it to be funny.  I was wrong, it's still funny.",5,Big Bang Theory,104,22
24941,Sheldon,19," Oh, good. Hah-hah!",5,Big Bang Theory,19,3
24943,Penny,19," Amy, what's wrong?",5,Big Bang Theory,19,3
24944,Amy,19, My boyfriend's a jerk.,5,Big Bang Theory,23,4
24945,Penny,19," Well, I know he didn't cheat on you, so what happened?",5,Big Bang Theory,55,11
24946,Amy,19," I had to go to my aunt's party all by myself, and everybody was like, where's this boyfriend you're always talking about? Is he real, or did you make him up like Armin the miniature horse breeder?",5,Big Bang Theory,197,37
24947,Penny,19, Who's Armin the miniature horse breeder?,5,Big Bang Theory,41,6
24948,Amy,19, The pretend boyfriend I invented to get my family off my back. It unravelled quickly when I couldn't answer the question how'd you two meet?,5,Big Bang Theory,141,25
24949,Penny,19, I would have thought at a miniature horse show.,5,Big Bang Theory,48,9
24950,Amy,19," Oh, that's good.",5,Big Bang Theory,17,3
24951,Penny,19, Mm.,5,Big Bang Theory,4,1
24952,Amy,19, I panicked and said Woodstock. I just wanted to show Sheldon off to my family.,5,Big Bang Theory,79,15
24953,Penny,19," Sure, I get that. I mean, he's your first boyfriend and all.",5,Big Bang Theory,61,12
24954,Amy,19," Not just my first boyfriend, he's the best boyfriend. I mean, think about it. I'm dating Sheldon Cooper.",5,Big Bang Theory,105,18
24955,Penny,19, Yes. On purpose.,5,Big Bang Theory,17,3
24956,Amy,19," He's handsome, he's lanky, he's brilliant, and his skin has that pale, waxy quality.",5,Big Bang Theory,85,14
24957,Penny,19," Well, sickly is the new sexy.",5,Big Bang Theory,30,6
24958,Amy,19, Yeah.,5,Big Bang Theory,6,1
24959,Penny,19," Mm. You know, Amy, sometimes when you're in a relationship with someone you really care about, the sucky part is, it leaves you open to getting hurt.",5,Big Bang Theory,150,27
24960,Amy,19, Do you ever worry about Leonard doing that to you?,5,Big Bang Theory,51,10
24961,Penny,19, That's hilarious. No.,5,Big Bang Theory,22,3
24964,Sheldon,19," Dr. Rostenkowski, it may interest you to know that saying pew, pew, pew isn't as effective as pressing your blaster key. In the same way that saying whee doesn't make the land speeder go.",5,Big Bang Theory,188,34
24966,Leonard,19," Raj, Imperial Troopers on your tail.",5,Big Bang Theory,37,6
24967,Raj,19," Got him. When Gandhi advocated his philosophy of non-violence, I bet he didn't know how much fun it was killing stuff.",5,Big Bang Theory,119,21
24968,Leonard,19," All right, I think we got them all. Let's divide up the loot.",5,Big Bang Theory,62,13
24970,Howard,19, But I worked hard to get this armour.,5,Big Bang Theory,38,8
24972,Howard,19," Fine, I'll change.  ",5,Big Bang Theory,21,3
24973,Sheldon,19, Hah-hah!,5,Big Bang Theory,9,1
24975,Amy,19, I don't think I want to play a game.,5,Big Bang Theory,37,9
24976,Penny,19," Oh, come on. They're playing one across the hall, we should, too. Okay, we are gonna take turns bouncing a quarter off the table, and if it goes into this cup, the other person has to drink. Then you get to go again",5,Big Bang Theory,216,43
24977,Amy,19, Like that?,5,Big Bang Theory,11,2
24978,Penny,19," Wow. Yeah, b-beginner's luck. So, now I will drink this entire cup of beer, and you will go again and we can uh all right. So, yeah, okay, now I'm gonna drink this entire cup and then I'm going to drink another one Okay, seriously, stop. What the hell?",5,Big Bang Theory,253,49
24979,Amy,19," Spent a lot of my childhood throwing coins into wishing wells hoping for friends. At a certain point, you start doing trick shots just to keep things interesting.",5,Big Bang Theory,163,28
24980,Penny,19," Whoa, whoa, give me a second to catch up here. Hold on. ",5,Big Bang Theory,57,12
24981,Amy,19, That'd be my boyfriend. Happier playing his dopey Star Trek game with his friends than hanging out with me.,5,Big Bang Theory,108,19
24982,Penny,19, Wars.,5,Big Bang Theory,6,1
24983,Amy,19, What?,5,Big Bang Theory,6,1
24984,Penny,19, Star Wars. They get all cranky when you mix the two up.,5,Big Bang Theory,56,12
24985,Amy,19, What's the difference?,5,Big Bang Theory,23,3
24986,Penny,19, There's absolutely no difference.,5,Big Bang Theory,34,4
24987,Amy,19, How do I get him to treat me better?,5,Big Bang Theory,37,9
24988,Penny,19," All right. Let me give you a little girlfriend 101. Usually the first move out of the gate is you withhold sex, but that will work better after Sheldon hits puberty. So, I'd say give him the silent treatment.",5,Big Bang Theory,209,39
24989,Amy,19," No, he loves that.",5,Big Bang Theory,19,4
24990,Penny,19, Hmm.,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
24991,Amy,19, Our record for sitting in a room together and not speaking to each other is six-and-a half hours. He said it was a magical evening.,5,Big Bang Theory,132,25
24992,Penny,19," All right, then we're gonna have to go with an oldie but goodie, making a scene.",5,Big Bang Theory,81,16
24993,Amy,19, I don't think I'd be good at that.,5,Big Bang Theory,35,8
24994,Penny,19," That's why you're lucky to have me. Back in Omaha, there are two different restaurants I'm not allowed into. Both Chili's.",5,Big Bang Theory,123,21
24996,Raj,19," Bernadette, remember, your character's the healer in our group. You're in charge of healing all of us, not just Howard.",5,Big Bang Theory,120,20
24998,Sheldon,19, That is the most sickeningly sweet thing I have ever experienced. And I am sipping Kool-Aid through a Red Vine.,5,Big Bang Theory,112,20
24999,Amy,19," Sheldon Cooper, I've got a bone to pick with you, and I'm about to do it in front of all your friends.",5,Big Bang Theory,103,22
25000,Penny,19," Yeah, you pick that bone. You pick that bone clean!",5,Big Bang Theory,52,10
25001,Amy,19," I'm gonna publicly shame you, and then sit back as societal pressure compels you to modify your behaviour.",5,Big Bang Theory,107,18
25002,Penny,19," Ooh, burn!",5,Big Bang Theory,11,2
25003,Amy,19," And if you don't start treating me better, I'm leaving you for a miniature horse breeder named Armin.",5,Big Bang Theory,102,18
25004,Sheldon,19, Armin who?,5,Big Bang Theory,11,2
25005,Amy,19, Armin damn it.,5,Big Bang Theory,15,3
25006,Penny,19," Sheldon, she wanted to show you off to her family, and you stood her up, okay? Look at this adorable, smushy face. Smush, smush, smush, smush.",5,Big Bang Theory,143,26
25007,Amy,19, You're hurting me.,5,Big Bang Theory,19,3
25008,Penny,19," No, Sheldon hurt you.",5,Big Bang Theory,22,4
25009,Amy,19, Before; now it's you.,5,Big Bang Theory,22,4
25010,Penny,19, Oh.,5,Big Bang Theory,4,1
25011,Sheldon,19," I think I understand. You're the one person who can say Sheldon Cooper is your boyfriend, but that rings hollow if you can't lord him over others in the flesh. I forget what I bring to the party and what I take away when I leave. Please accept these valuable Cooper Coupons as restitution.",5,Big Bang Theory,290,54
25012,Penny,19," Sheldon, she doesn't want your stupid",5,Big Bang Theory,38,6
25013,Amy,19," Ooh, Science Center. Redeeming. Let's go.",5,Big Bang Theory,42,6
25014,Sheldon,19," Well played, Amy Farrah Fowler. Let me get my coat.  Oh, grow up, Leonard.",5,Big Bang Theory,75,14
25015,Raj,19," But e-excuse me, I have something to say. None of you may realize it, but I was very much looking forward to this weekend. It was gonna be like the old days, the four of us hanging out playing video games before you guys all got girlfriends. Do you have any idea what it's like to be the only one without a girlfriend? Even if I get one someday, I'll still be the guy who got a girl after Sheldon Cooper!",5,Big Bang Theory,405,81
25016,Penny,19," And that's how a girl makes a scene. I'm sorry, sweetie. You're right. You deserve your weekend. Come on, Amy, let's go.",5,Big Bang Theory,121,22
25017,Amy,19, What about the Science Center?,5,Big Bang Theory,31,5
25018,Penny,19, I'll let you hold my hair while I throw up.,5,Big Bang Theory,44,10
25019,Amy,19, Rain check.,5,Big Bang Theory,12,2
25021,Howard,19, I'll miss you.,5,Big Bang Theory,15,3
25023,Howard,19, I'll miss you more.,5,Big Bang Theory,20,4
25025,Raj,19," Just leave! Okay, now. This is the way it's supposed to be. Men together, fighting the forces of evil.",5,Big Bang Theory,103,19
25027,Raj,19, I can't believe this is only 64 calories.,5,Big Bang Theory,42,8
25030,Howard,19," That's my ride, got to go. ",5,Big Bang Theory,28,6
25032,Penny,20," Oh my God, I love this chicken.",5,Big Bang Theory,32,7
25033,Sheldon,20," Oh, you know what they say, the best things in life are free.",5,Big Bang Theory,62,13
25034,Penny,20," Okay, you're right, I eat your food a lot. How about this, you can raid my fridge any time you want.",5,Big Bang Theory,101,21
25035,Sheldon,20," Oh, that's very kind of you. Next time I have a hankering to wash down a D cell battery with a jar of old pickle juice, I'll come a-knocking.",5,Big Bang Theory,142,29
25036,Howard,20," Hey, Raj, you didn't send your RSVP in. I'm supposed to ask you if you're bringing someone to the wedding.",5,Big Bang Theory,107,20
25037,Raj,20, I'll let you know.,5,Big Bang Theory,19,4
25038,Howard,20," Well, can you make it soon. There's a battle royale going on over the seating charts. In one corner, Bernadette's mom, and the other three, mine.",5,Big Bang Theory,146,26
25039,Sheldon,20," Yeah, I hate wedding receptions. I wish the bride and groom would take a cue from Bilbo Baggins, slip on the ring, disappear and everyone goes home.",5,Big Bang Theory,149,27
25040,Leonard,20," Mmm, you liked Professor Guyster's wedding.",5,Big Bang Theory,44,6
25041,Sheldon,20," They had a make your own sundae bar. Ooh, that was a night to remember. Do you know, on the one trip, I just had a bowl of nuts.",5,Big Bang Theory,129,29
25042,Howard,20," Anyway, you gotta let me know if you have a plus one, because if not my mom's trying to sneak in the doctor who sucked the fat out of her neck.",5,Big Bang Theory,144,31
25043,Raj,20," Alright, uh, fine, I'm coming and I'm bringing somebody. Uh, Koothrappali plus one.",5,Big Bang Theory,84,13
25044,Leonard,20, Who you bringing?,5,Big Bang Theory,18,3
25045,Raj,20, Who are you bringing?,5,Big Bang Theory,22,4
25046,Penny,20, He's bringing me. Who are you bringing?,5,Big Bang Theory,40,7
25047,Raj,20," Wow, what a bunch of Nosey O'Donnells.",5,Big Bang Theory,39,7
25048,Howard,20," Come on, who is it?",5,Big Bang Theory,20,5
25049,Raj,20, I'm not telling. I'm from Asia. I'm mysterious. Deal with it.,5,Big Bang Theory,62,11
25050,Sheldon,20," Howard, are you having a make your own sundae bar?",5,Big Bang Theory,51,10
25051,Howard,20," No, uh, I don't think so.",5,Big Bang Theory,26,6
25052,Sheldon,20," Well you should. 50% of marriages end in divorce, but 100% of make your own sundae bars end in happiness.",5,Big Bang Theory,106,20
25054,Raj,20," Hello Mummy, Daddy, how are you?",5,Big Bang Theory,33,6
25057,Raj,20," Listen, uh, there's something I want to talk to you about. I, I wasn't ready until now, but I think it's time.",5,Big Bang Theory,111,22
25060,Raj,20," No, I'm not gay. If anything, I'm metrosexual.",5,Big Bang Theory,47,8
25062,Raj,20, It means I like women as well as their skincare products.,5,Big Bang Theory,58,11
25064,Raj,20," â€˜Cause I, I'm tired of trying to meet someone and, I think I'd like you to help me find uh, a wife.",5,Big Bang Theory,102,22
25066,Raj,20, Yes.,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
25071,Sheldon,20, Quantum physics makes me so happy.,5,Big Bang Theory,35,6
25072,Leonard,20," Yeah, I'm glad.",5,Big Bang Theory,16,3
25073,Sheldon,20, It's like looking at the universe naked.  ,5,Big Bang Theory,43,7
25074,Penny,20," Hi, you guys got a minute?",5,Big Bang Theory,27,6
25075,Leonard,20," Sure, what's up?",5,Big Bang Theory,17,3
25076,Penny,20," Well, I was thinking about Sheldon's little joke the other night about me eating all your food.",5,Big Bang Theory,96,17
25077,Sheldon,20," Oh, that was no joke. But I understand your confusion as I am our group's resident cut-up.",5,Big Bang Theory,91,17
25078,Leonard,20," I'm sorry, you are our resident cut-up?",5,Big Bang Theory,40,7
25079,Sheldon,20, Yes.,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
25080,Leonard,20, Prove it.,5,Big Bang Theory,10,2
25081,Sheldon,20," Knock, knock.",5,Big Bang Theory,14,2
25082,Leonard,20, Who's there?,5,Big Bang Theory,13,2
25083,Sheldon,20, Interrupting physicist.,5,Big Bang Theory,24,2
25084,Leonard,20, Interrupting physi,5,Big Bang Theory,19,2
25085,Sheldon,20, MUON!,5,Big Bang Theory,6,1
25086,Penny,20," Anyway, I got a little residual cheque from my commercial and I thought, hey, how about I get the guys a little thankyou to pay them back. So, Sheldon, ta-da!",5,Big Bang Theory,159,30
25087,Sheldon,20," Ah! A vintage, mint in box, 1975 Mego Star Trek transporter with real transporter action. Hot-darn!",5,Big Bang Theory,100,16
25088,Leonard,20, Where did you get that?,5,Big Bang Theory,24,5
25089,Penny,20," Uh, from Stuart at the comic-book store.",5,Big Bang Theory,41,7
25090,Leonard,20, You went to the comic-book store by yourself?,5,Big Bang Theory,46,8
25091,Penny,20," Yeah, it was fun, I walked in and two different guys got asthma attacks. Felt pretty good.",5,Big Bang Theory,91,17
25092,Sheldon,20, Well this calls for an expression of gratitude.,5,Big Bang Theory,48,8
25093,Penny,20," Ooh, am I about to get a rare Sheldon Cooper hug?",5,Big Bang Theory,50,11
25094,Sheldon,20, Not this time. Then they wouldn't be special. Thanks Penny.,5,Big Bang Theory,60,10
25095,Penny,20," You're welcome. Don't worry, I didn't forget about you. Leonard, I got you a label maker.",5,Big Bang Theory,90,16
25096,Leonard,20," Wow. No, it's great. Also, uh, mint in box.",5,Big Bang Theory,44,9
25097,Penny,20," Mmm. And, I got you a transporter too!",5,Big Bang Theory,39,8
25098,Leonard,20, Awesome!,5,Big Bang Theory,9,1
25099,Sheldon,20," Look, it was actually designed for my vintage Mr Spock action figure.",5,Big Bang Theory,70,12
25100,Penny,20," Oh, that's great. Let's open it up and put him in there.",5,Big Bang Theory,57,12
25101,Leonard,20, Ah!,5,Big Bang Theory,4,1
25102,Sheldon,20, Oh dear Lord. No!,5,Big Bang Theory,18,4
25103,Penny,20," Why, they're just toys?",5,Big Bang Theory,24,4
25104,Sheldon,20, They're mint in box.,5,Big Bang Theory,21,4
25105,Leonard,20, They're Collectables.,5,Big Bang Theory,22,2
25106,Penny,20, C'mon can't we just open one up and take a,5,Big Bang Theory,43,10
25108,Leonard,20, Once you open the box it loses its value.,5,Big Bang Theory,42,9
25109,Penny,20," Yeah, yeah, my mom gave me the same lecture about my virginity. Gotta tell you, it was a lot more fun taking it out and playing with it.",5,Big Bang Theory,137,28
25112,Raj,20," Oh yes. In my culture it's expected to have a chaparone to oversee a first date. Plus I want to make a good impression and, no offence, but with you guys here I look like six two.",5,Big Bang Theory,180,37
25114,Howard,20, Hindus do the same thing. Except they leave room for a cow.,5,Big Bang Theory,60,12
25115,Raj,20," Listen, I love your charming racist humour, but any chance you could not knock my religion while she's here.",5,Big Bang Theory,109,19
25116,Howard,20, Yesterday you made fun of me for eating lox.,5,Big Bang Theory,45,9
25117,Raj,20, It's different. You're people don't worship lox.,5,Big Bang Theory,49,7
25118,Howard,20, Well clearly you've never been to brunch with my cousins.,5,Big Bang Theory,58,10
25120,Raj,20," Oh, no, no, I get a say in it. But I'm sure whoever shows up will be better company than a threesome I've been having with Aunt Jemima and Mrs Butterworth.",5,Big Bang Theory,156,31
25122,Raj,20," Oh, yes. You must be Lakshmi. Uh, nice to meet you.",5,Big Bang Theory,52,11
25124,Raj,20," Oh, uh, these are my, my friends. This is Bernadette.",5,Big Bang Theory,54,10
25126,Raj,20, And this is Howard.,5,Big Bang Theory,20,4
25127,Howard,20, Nice to meet you.,5,Big Bang Theory,18,4
25129,Raj,20, Please have a seat.  I'm thinking double wedding!,5,Big Bang Theory,50,8
25132,Sheldon,20, Is someone there?,5,Big Bang Theory,18,3
25134,Sheldon,20, Spock?,5,Big Bang Theory,7,1
25136,Sheldon,20, Fascinating. The only logical explanation is that this is a dream.,5,Big Bang Theory,67,11
25138,Sheldon,20, Was I hit on the head by a coconut.,5,Big Bang Theory,36,9
25140,Sheldon,20, But it's mint in box.,5,Big Bang Theory,22,5
25142,Sheldon,20," Well, I'm not going to dignify that with a response.",5,Big Bang Theory,53,10
25144,Sheldon,20, To be played with.,5,Big Bang Theory,19,4
25146,Sheldon,20," Illogical. Oh, damn it Spock, you're right. I'll do it.",5,Big Bang Theory,56,10
25148,Sheldon,20," Oh, of course. Set phasers to dumb, right?  Goody, goody, goody. This is wrong. This is wrong. I'm so excited, but this is wrong. I'm gonna do it. I'm doing it. I did it. Oh, that's what I always thought 1975 smelled like. One to beam down Mr Scott. Aye, aye, Mr Spock. Energise. . Energise.  Don't be broken. Please don't be broken.  What did you make me do? Okay, okay, think.  It's only logical.",5,Big Bang Theory,399,75
25151,Raj,20," Well, I hope you saved room for chocolate lava cake.",5,Big Bang Theory,53,10
25153,Raj,20," Well, you start off by trying to make chocolate souffle, and when it falls you panic, quickly change the name, and voila! Lava cake.",5,Big Bang Theory,133,24
25155,Raj,20," Well, let's see. Yup, three missed calls.",5,Big Bang Theory,42,7
25157,Raj,20, I'd like to tell them things are going well.,5,Big Bang Theory,45,9
25159,Raj,20," Okay, what page are you on?",5,Big Bang Theory,28,6
25161,Raj,20, Say again.,5,Big Bang Theory,11,2
25163,Raj,20," Like, dude on dude, but with women?",5,Big Bang Theory,36,7
25165,Raj,20," Why me, of all people?",5,Big Bang Theory,23,5
25167,Raj,20, I'm not gay.,5,Big Bang Theory,13,3
25169,Raj,20," That's Unbreakable by Khloe and Lamar. And for your information, it's unisex.",5,Big Bang Theory,78,12
25171,Raj,20, I like to boogie.,5,Big Bang Theory,18,4
25173,Raj,20, W-w-with women. I like to boogie with women.,5,Big Bang Theory,45,8
25175,Raj,20," Thankyou. And once again, my baloney likes girls. Wait-wait. You don't want to put a bit of that in your mouth without trying my homemade chantilly cream. Yeah, okay, that time I heard it.",5,Big Bang Theory,189,34
25177,Sheldon,20, Oh dear. Two suns and no sunscreen.,5,Big Bang Theory,36,7
25179,Sheldon,20," What is it now, tiny Spock?",5,Big Bang Theory,28,6
25181,Sheldon,20, You're the one who told me to play with it.,5,Big Bang Theory,44,10
25183,Sheldon,20," No. If I got on the bridge of the Enterprise, I would never, ever leave.",5,Big Bang Theory,73,15
25185,Sheldon,20," Why? I got away with it. Leonard has his toy, and he's never going to open it, so he won't know it's broken. And I have a toy that isn't broken. Everybody's happy.",5,Big Bang Theory,164,33
25187,Sheldon,20, I thought where you come from they don't have emotions.,5,Big Bang Theory,56,10
25189,Sheldon,20," You know what you are? Well, you're a green blooded buzzkill. Perhaps it's time you beam on out of here.",5,Big Bang Theory,105,20
25191,Sheldon,20," Very well. Cooper to Enterprise, one to beam up. Energise.  Ah. Tiny Spock. Help.",5,Big Bang Theory,82,14
25193,Raj,20, Ready for lunch?,5,Big Bang Theory,17,3
25194,Howard,20," Yep, one sec.  Ah, good. Ma would have killed me if she'd found out I'd broke my retainer.",5,Big Bang Theory,91,18
25195,Raj,20," Hey, uh, can I run something by you? It's about Lakshmi.",5,Big Bang Theory,57,11
25196,Howard,20, Yeah. Sure. How are things going?,5,Big Bang Theory,34,6
25197,Raj,20," We hit a couple of bumps. She lives over on Manhattan Beach, so it takes over an hour to get there. And she's a lesbian.",5,Big Bang Theory,121,25
25198,Howard,20," What do you mean, she's a lesbian?",5,Big Bang Theory,35,7
25199,Raj,20," Well, you know whenever you and I would try to hit on women in bars, and they'd blow us off, and then we'd tell each other they were probably gay. It's like that. Except this time it's true.",5,Big Bang Theory,191,38
25200,Howard,20, Then why did she even go out with you?,5,Big Bang Theory,39,9
25201,Raj,20," She was looking for a husband so she can appear to be straight. And you know, it sounded crazy to me at first, but I'm actually thinking about doing it.",5,Big Bang Theory,153,30
25202,Howard,20," Okay, well, so the reason that might sound crazy, is 'cause it's crazy.",5,Big Bang Theory,72,13
25203,Raj,20," Look, Howard, you're in a relationship. You know you have to make compromises.",5,Big Bang Theory,79,13
25204,Howard,20," Well, yes. But my compromises are about which bedspread to buy, or whose turn it is to do the laundry, Bernadette's or my mom's.",5,Big Bang Theory,129,24
25205,Raj,20," It's a great deal. We both get our parents off our backs. I don't have to come home to an empty apartment every night, plus, once I'm married, I can finally eat carbs again and let myself go.",5,Big Bang Theory,192,38
25206,Howard,20," Why don't you tell your parents you want to try and find someone else, you know, maybe one who hasn't slept with more women than you.",5,Big Bang Theory,134,26
25207,Raj,20, Because this one wants to marry me. I might never find another one who does.,5,Big Bang Theory,77,15
25208,Howard,20, So you're seriously thinking about marrying someone you're never going to have sex with.,5,Big Bang Theory,89,14
25209,Raj,20, I can't believe your attitude. I thought you were in favour of gay people getting married.,5,Big Bang Theory,91,16
25210,Howard,20," Yes, to other gay people.",5,Big Bang Theory,26,5
25211,Raj,20, Do you hear how homophobic you sound?,5,Big Bang Theory,38,7
25213,Sheldon,20," Oh, I don't want a broken toy.  Nothing!",5,Big Bang Theory,41,8
25214,Leonard,20, What?,5,Big Bang Theory,6,1
25215,Sheldon,20, Nothing. I said nothing.,5,Big Bang Theory,25,4
25216,Penny,20, That was weird.,5,Big Bang Theory,16,3
25217,Leonard,20, Really? I don't even notice any more.,5,Big Bang Theory,38,7
25218,Penny,20, I cannot believe you guys aren't going to play with these.,5,Big Bang Theory,59,11
25219,Leonard,20," Well I told you, you don't, it's mint in box.",5,Big Bang Theory,46,10
25220,Penny,20, I dunno. I just think it's a waste.  Relax. I'm just looking at the box.,5,Big Bang Theory,73,15
25221,Sheldon,20," Perhaps you should look with your eyes, and not your muscular Nebraska man-hands.",5,Big Bang Theory,82,13
25222,Penny,20, What is your problem?,5,Big Bang Theory,22,4
25223,Sheldon,20," My problem is that I don't want you to break Leonard's toy, which you probably did by shaking it. She shook it. We all saw her.",5,Big Bang Theory,128,26
25224,Penny,20," Leonard, I bought you this because I wanted you to have fun with it. I don't want it to just sit in this box.",5,Big Bang Theory,110,24
25225,Leonard,20," You know, you're right. I mean, it's from you, I'm never going to sell it. I'm opening it.",5,Big Bang Theory,91,18
25226,Penny,20, Yes.,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
25227,Sheldon,20, Mmmmm!,5,Big Bang Theory,7,1
25228,Leonard,20, It's broken.,5,Big Bang Theory,13,2
25229,Penny,20, What?,5,Big Bang Theory,6,1
25230,Sheldon,20," Oh, nice job, man-hands.",5,Big Bang Theory,25,4
25231,Penny,20," I didn't break it. I, I guess Stuart sold it to me like this.",5,Big Bang Theory,62,14
25232,Sheldon,20," Yes. Yes, he did, that is a perfectly satisfying and plausible explanation. Yeah, let's all be mad at Stuart.",5,Big Bang Theory,110,19
25233,Penny,20," You know, I paid a lot for this. Let's take it over there and show him.",5,Big Bang Theory,72,16
25234,Leonard,20, Absolutely.,5,Big Bang Theory,12,1
25235,Sheldon,20," Wait. It was me. I opened your toy, discovered it was broken and didn't tell you.",5,Big Bang Theory,82,16
25236,Leonard,20, Why would you open mine?,5,Big Bang Theory,25,5
25237,Sheldon,20, I didn't. That was a lie. I opened my own toy. And it was already broken so I switched them.,5,Big Bang Theory,93,20
25238,Leonard,20," Well, you should talk to Stuart.",5,Big Bang Theory,33,6
25239,Sheldon,20, I can't because that was a lie. Yours was broken in an earthquake. And that's a lie.,5,Big Bang Theory,85,17
25240,Penny,20, What is the truth?,5,Big Bang Theory,19,4
25241,Sheldon,20, My Mr Spock doll came to me in a dream and forced me to open it. And when the toy broke I switched it for yours. Later he encouraged me to do the right thing and I defied him. And then I was attacked by a Gorn.,5,Big Bang Theory,211,47
25242,Leonard,20," Okay, that I believe.",5,Big Bang Theory,22,4
25243,Penny,20, Mmm.,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
25244,Sheldon,20," Leonard, Penny, I just, I want you both to know that I regret my actions toward the two of you. That's a lie.",5,Big Bang Theory,110,23
25245,Leonard,20," So, is that one mine.",5,Big Bang Theory,22,5
25246,Sheldon,20, Yes.,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
25247,Leonard,20," Well, hand it over so I can open it.",5,Big Bang Theory,37,9
25248,Sheldon,20," Okay. Leonard, even though I don't have one any more, I hope you have fun playing with it.",5,Big Bang Theory,91,18
25249,Leonard,20," And that's a lie, right?",5,Big Bang Theory,25,5
25250,Sheldon,20, Big fat whopper. I hope it breaks.,5,Big Bang Theory,35,7
25252,Raj,20," This is a treat, what brings you guys by?",5,Big Bang Theory,42,9
25254,Raj,20," What, you told her?",5,Big Bang Theory,20,4
25255,Howard,20, I told everybody.,5,Big Bang Theory,18,3
25257,Howard,20," Well, actually we kind of agreed to disagree on that one, but we both think you shouldn't marry this woman.",5,Big Bang Theory,108,20
25258,Raj,20," So, while I'm waiting for this mysterious perfect match, who may or may not exist, I'm supposed to just be alone.",5,Big Bang Theory,114,21
25260,Raj,20," Oh, my goodness. Aren't you the cutest little Yorkie ever? You got him for me?",5,Big Bang Theory,79,15
25261,Howard,20, Her. We thought you two would hit it off.,5,Big Bang Theory,42,9
25262,Raj,20, I think we already have. Thank you guys so much. Let's see if you fit in my man purse.,5,Big Bang Theory,87,19
25265,Howard,21," So, I got the craziest e-mail this morning.",5,Big Bang Theory,44,8
25266,Raj,21," I don't mean to burst your bubble, dude, but those penile enlargement pills do not work.",5,Big Bang Theory,89,16
25267,Howard,21," Believe me, I know. The e-mail I got was from the office of Stephen Hawking.",5,Big Bang Theory,77,15
25268,Leonard,21, You're kidding.,5,Big Bang Theory,16,2
25269,Raj,21, Why?,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
25270,Howard,21," He's coming to the university for a couple weeks to lecture, and he's looking for an engineer to help maintain the equipment on his wheelchair.",5,Big Bang Theory,144,25
25271,Leonard,21," That's amazing. You'll be like his pit crew. A word of caution, I would not do your Stephen Hawking impression in front of him.",5,Big Bang Theory,128,24
25272,Howard,21, You're right. I suppose that could be considered offensive.,5,Big Bang Theory,60,9
25273,Raj,21," Oh, boy, Sheldon's going to freak out.",5,Big Bang Theory,39,7
25274,Leonard,21," Yeah, he worships Hawking.",5,Big Bang Theory,27,4
25275,Howard,21, I was actually thinking about bringing him along when I go over there so he can meet the great man.,5,Big Bang Theory,100,20
25276,Raj,21," That's really nice of you, Howard.",5,Big Bang Theory,35,6
25277,Howard,21," Hm, it's no big deal.",5,Big Bang Theory,22,5
25278,Leonard,21," Boy, a restraining order from Stephen Hawking. It'll look so nice next to the ones he's already got from Leonard Nimoy, Carl Sagan and Stan Lee.",5,Big Bang Theory,145,26
25279,Sheldon,21," Leonard, do you recall when I said that I was going to revolutionize humanity's understanding of the Higgs boson particle, and you said, Sheldon, it's two a.m., get out of my bedroom?",5,Big Bang Theory,184,32
25280,Leonard,21, Like it was ten hours ago. What about it?,5,Big Bang Theory,42,9
25281,Sheldon,21," Well, I believe I've done it. And I'm only saying believe to sound modest, because, sweet Sam Houston, I did it.",5,Big Bang Theory,113,21
25282,Leonard,21, Really?,5,Big Bang Theory,8,1
25283,Raj,21," That's incredible. Oh, here, break out the math.",5,Big Bang Theory,49,8
25284,Sheldon,21," Oh, okay, let me see this. All right, so this particle here is the boson moving forward in time. Now, I was thinking Howard, you go ahead and eat. This isn't going to make any sense to you.",5,Big Bang Theory,190,38
25285,Howard,21," Sheldon, I have a working understanding of physics.",5,Big Bang Theory,52,8
25286,Sheldon,21," Yeah, good for you, and don't stop working on it.",5,Big Bang Theory,50,10
25287,Raj,21, Are you still going to tell him about you-know-who?,5,Big Bang Theory,52,9
25288,Howard,21, Yep.,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
25289,Leonard,21, Still going to introduce him?,5,Big Bang Theory,30,5
25290,Howard,21, Not on your life.,5,Big Bang Theory,18,4
25292,Sheldon,21," Please, please, please let me meet Hawking.",5,Big Bang Theory,44,7
25293,Howard,21," I told you, no.",5,Big Bang Theory,16,4
25294,Sheldon,21, But I said I'm sorry.,5,Big Bang Theory,22,5
25295,Howard,21," No, you said, would it help if I said I'm sorry?",5,Big Bang Theory,49,11
25296,Sheldon,21, And you never answered me. So who owes whom an apology now?,5,Big Bang Theory,60,12
25297,Howard,21," Sheldon, you're a condescending jerk. Why on earth would I want to do something nice for you?",5,Big Bang Theory,94,17
25298,Sheldon,21," Um, to go to Jewish heaven?",5,Big Bang Theory,28,6
25299,Howard,21, Jews don't have heaven.,5,Big Bang Theory,24,4
25300,Sheldon,21, Then to avoid Jewish hell?,5,Big Bang Theory,27,5
25301,Howard,21, Have you met my mother? I live in Jewish hell.,5,Big Bang Theory,47,10
25302,Sheldon,21," Howard, please. This is Stephen Hawking. Perhaps my only intellectual equal.",5,Big Bang Theory,77,11
25303,Howard,21," Oh, you can't be serious.",5,Big Bang Theory,26,5
25304,Sheldon,21, Try to put yourself in my place. Imagine you're the sole human being living on a planet populated with nothing but dogs. And then it turns out there's another human being.,5,Big Bang Theory,172,31
25305,Howard,21, Hang on. Are you saying the rest of us are dogs?,5,Big Bang Theory,49,11
25306,Sheldon,21," Yeah, okay, I can see you're going to take this the wrong way. Let me try again. Imagine you're the sole human being living on a planet populated with nothing but chimps.",5,Big Bang Theory,171,32
25307,Howard,21, Get out of my lab.,5,Big Bang Theory,19,5
25308,Sheldon,21," Oh, now they're so much smarter than dogs. Have you seen them on those little bicycles?",5,Big Bang Theory,88,16
25309,Howard,21, Get out.,5,Big Bang Theory,9,2
25310,Sheldon,21, How about dolphins?,5,Big Bang Theory,20,3
25311,Howard,21, Out!,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
25313,Leonard,21," So, come on, how was the first day with Hawking?",5,Big Bang Theory,49,10
25314,Howard,21, It was great. We talked about movies.,5,Big Bang Theory,38,7
25315,Sheldon,21, Oh!,5,Big Bang Theory,4,1
25316,Howard,21, I showed him some card tricks.,5,Big Bang Theory,31,6
25317,Sheldon,21, Oh!,5,Big Bang Theory,4,1
25318,Howard,21, He even let me read a couple pages from his new book.,5,Big Bang Theory,54,12
25319,Sheldon,21, Oh!,5,Big Bang Theory,4,1
25320,Howard,21," Something got you down there, bunky?",5,Big Bang Theory,37,6
25321,Sheldon,21," Howard, please, I'm begging you.",5,Big Bang Theory,33,5
25322,Leonard,21," Raj, you're our group historian. Has Sheldon ever begged before?",5,Big Bang Theory,65,10
25323,Raj,21," Three times. He begged the Fox network not to cancel Firefly. He begged the TNT network to cancel Babylon 5. And when he got food poisoning at the Rose Bowl Parade, he begged a deity he doesn't believe in to end his life quickly.",5,Big Bang Theory,230,44
25324,Sheldon,21," Do you understand how important Hawking is to me? When I was six years old, I dressed up as him for Halloween.",5,Big Bang Theory,111,22
25325,Howard,21, You're kidding.,5,Big Bang Theory,16,2
25326,Sheldon,21," No, sir, no, I took my dad's desk chair, attached a Speak & Spell to it and made my sister push me up and down the block to trick or treat. Granted most people thought I was R2-D2, but still, I got a lot of candy.",5,Big Bang Theory,214,46
25327,Howard,21," You don't seem to be understanding the English word no. Maybe a different language will help. Russian, nyet. Chinese, bu. Japanese, iie. Klingon, qo. Binary coded Ascii, 0110111001101111.",5,Big Bang Theory,188,28
25328,Sheldon,21, It's actually 01100111.,5,Big Bang Theory,24,3
25329,Howard,21, No!,5,Big Bang Theory,4,1
25330,Sheldon,21," I'm not asking for me, I'm asking for Hawking.",5,Big Bang Theory,47,9
25331,Howard,21," Let me try gansta, hells no.",5,Big Bang Theory,29,6
25332,Sheldon,21," Okay, look, how about this? Just give him my paper on the Higgs boson. If he sees the incredible breakthrough I've made, he'll reach out to me.",5,Big Bang Theory,144,27
25333,Leonard,21, What if he doesn't?,5,Big Bang Theory,20,4
25334,Sheldon,21," He will, he's really smart.",5,Big Bang Theory,28,5
25335,Howard,21, That's an interesting idea. Why don't you give me a minute to talk it over with my friends?,5,Big Bang Theory,92,18
25336,Sheldon,21, How do I do that?,5,Big Bang Theory,18,5
25337,Howard,21, You walk away.,5,Big Bang Theory,15,3
25338,Sheldon,21, Walking away.,5,Big Bang Theory,14,2
25339,Leonard,21, You do realize you own his ass right now.,5,Big Bang Theory,42,9
25340,Howard,21, I do.,5,Big Bang Theory,6,2
25341,Raj,21, You can make him do anything you want.,5,Big Bang Theory,39,8
25342,Howard,21," Yeah, I know, I'm just trying to figure out how much I want to punish him.",5,Big Bang Theory,75,16
25343,Raj,21," Well, don't be too mean.",5,Big Bang Theory,25,5
25344,Sheldon,21," Hey, fellas, I'm thinking about making some freshly brewed iced tea if anyone would like some.",5,Big Bang Theory,95,16
25345,Raj,21, I wouldn't mind a glass.,5,Big Bang Theory,25,5
25346,Sheldon,21, I wasn't talking to you.,5,Big Bang Theory,25,5
25347,Raj,21, Bring him to his bony knees.,5,Big Bang Theory,29,6
25348,Howard,21," Sheldon, come on back.",5,Big Bang Theory,23,4
25349,Sheldon,21," Yes, yes. What did you decide?",5,Big Bang Theory,31,6
25350,Howard,21, I'll give your paper to Professor Hawking.,5,Big Bang Theory,43,7
25351,Sheldon,21," Great, thank you. Oh, that's terrific.",5,Big Bang Theory,39,6
25352,Howard,21," But in exchange, I'd like you to do a few things for me.",5,Big Bang Theory,57,13
25353,Sheldon,21, What kinds of things?,5,Big Bang Theory,22,4
25354,Howard,21, Are you familiar with the 12 labours of Hercules?,5,Big Bang Theory,50,9
25355,Sheldon,21, Of course.,5,Big Bang Theory,11,2
25356,Howard,21, You should be so lucky.,5,Big Bang Theory,24,5
25358,Sheldon,21, All right. What would you like me to do first?,5,Big Bang Theory,47,10
25359,Howard,21," Well, I thought I'd start you off by polishing my belt buckles.",5,Big Bang Theory,64,12
25360,Sheldon,21," Oh. By all means. When I was a boy, I would polish my Mee-Maw's silver. And she would entertain me with stories about growing up in Oklahoma. Interesting woman. You know, she once killed a prairie dog with a gravy boat.",5,Big Bang Theory,220,41
25361,Howard,21, That's nice.,5,Big Bang Theory,13,2
25362,Sheldon,21, That's a lot of belt buckles.,5,Big Bang Theory,30,6
25363,Howard,21," Funny thing is, I only have one belt. Anyway, I'll let you get started. Oh, by the way, the little marks, uh, that look like water spots, I tend to stand too close to the urinal, so what you're seeing there is splash back.",5,Big Bang Theory,223,44
25364,Sheldon,21, You make sissy on your belt buckles? Mee-Maw's forks never had that.,5,Big Bang Theory,69,12
25365,Howard,21," Here is a black light to check them. And for your own peace of mind, you might not want to shine that around the rest of the room.",5,Big Bang Theory,131,28
25366,Howard,21," Sheldon, these look great. They're like magnificent little crowns to hang over my magnificent little jewels. How'd you get them so shiny?",5,Big Bang Theory,138,22
25367,Sheldon,21," Oh, I-I buffed them with Turtle Wax. The man down at Pep Boys says from now on, the urine should just bead up and roll right off.",5,Big Bang Theory,130,27
25368,Howard,21, Way to go the extra mile. Your Mee-Maw would be proud.,5,Big Bang Theory,55,11
25369,Sheldon,21, My Mee-Maw must never know of this. Now will you give Professor Hawking my paper?,5,Big Bang Theory,82,15
25370,Howard,21," Oh, my dear boy, no. Okay. Next, this is a sexy French maid costume I bought for Bernadette. I thought it might spice things up and get her to dust my room at the same time, but I was wrong and really wrong.",5,Big Bang Theory,208,43
25371,Sheldon,21, And you want me to return it for you?,5,Big Bang Theory,38,9
25372,Howard,21," No, no, no, mon petit cherie.",5,Big Bang Theory,30,6
25374,Sheldon,21, What are you all staring at? Didn't you ever see a man try to get a meeting with Stephen Hawking before?,5,Big Bang Theory,105,21
25376,Penny,21, Hey.,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
25377,Sheldon,21, Hello.,5,Big Bang Theory,7,1
25378,Penny,21, It's not Saturday night. Why are you doing your laundry?,5,Big Bang Theory,57,10
25379,Sheldon,21, This is not my laundry.,5,Big Bang Theory,24,5
25380,Penny,21," Wow, are these Amy's? Kind of trashy, good for her.",5,Big Bang Theory,52,10
25381,Sheldon,21, Those are Howard's.,5,Big Bang Theory,20,3
25382,Penny,21, Ugh. Why are you washing Howard's man panties?,5,Big Bang Theory,47,8
25383,Sheldon,21," Because if I don't, he won't give my paper to Stephen Hawking. He's a famous physicist.",5,Big Bang Theory,88,16
25384,Penny,21," Yeah, yeah, I know, he's the wheelchair dude who invented time.",5,Big Bang Theory,64,11
25385,Sheldon,21, That's close enough.,5,Big Bang Theory,21,3
25386,Penny,21," I don't understand, why doesn't Howard just introduce you to the guy?",5,Big Bang Theory,70,12
25387,Sheldon,21," Because he's punishing me for being a, quote, condescending jerk. You don't think I'm condescending, do you?",5,Big Bang Theory,109,17
25388,Penny,21, Well,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
25389,Sheldon,21," Oh, I'm sorry, condescending means",5,Big Bang Theory,35,5
25390,Penny,21," I know what it means. And yes, you love correcting people and putting them down.",5,Big Bang Theory,81,15
25391,Sheldon,21," Au contraire. When I correct people I am raising them up. You should know, I do it for you more than anyone.",5,Big Bang Theory,109,22
25392,Penny,21," Come on, you do it to feel superior. I see that twinkle in your eye when someone says who instead of whom or thinks the moon is a planet.",5,Big Bang Theory,138,29
25393,Sheldon,21, Or Don Quixote is a book about a donkey named Hotay.,5,Big Bang Theory,53,11
25394,Penny,21," See, there it is, there's that twinkle.",5,Big Bang Theory,40,7
25395,Sheldon,21," Well, I can't help it. That's an involuntary twinkle.",5,Big Bang Theory,54,9
25396,Penny,21," What do you want me to tell you, Sheldon?",5,Big Bang Theory,42,9
25397,Sheldon,21, I want you to tell me that Howard is being mean to me for no reason.,5,Big Bang Theory,69,16
25398,Penny,21," Fine, Howard is being mean to you for no reason.",5,Big Bang Theory,49,10
25399,Sheldon,21, I knew it.,5,Big Bang Theory,11,3
25401,Howard,21, What's the matter?,5,Big Bang Theory,19,3
25403,Howard,21," It's not her fault. She's getting hormone replacement therapy. Makes her crazy horny. Check this out, I got Sheldon to wear the French maid's costume.",5,Big Bang Theory,151,25
25405,Howard,21," Hey, I gave you first crack at it.",5,Big Bang Theory,35,8
25407,Howard,21, He's mean to me all the time. You've heard him tease me about not having a doctorate.,5,Big Bang Theory,86,17
25409,Howard,21," Oh, come on, the man torments me. I'm just letting him have a little taste of his own medicine.",5,Big Bang Theory,96,19
25411,Howard,21," Fine, I'll just make him do a couple more things, then I'll stop.",5,Big Bang Theory,66,13
25417,Sheldon,21," What is it now, Mrs. Wolowitz?",5,Big Bang Theory,31,6
25419,Sheldon,21, What do you want me to do?,5,Big Bang Theory,27,7
25421,Sheldon,21, I'm not sure how to do this.,5,Big Bang Theory,29,7
25423,Sheldon,21," Sleeping bags don't usually sweat this much, but okay.",5,Big Bang Theory,55,9
25425,Sheldon,21," Oh, if we squeeze you any tighter, you may turn into a diamond.",5,Big Bang Theory,64,13
25427,Sheldon,21," Oh, no, you know, I'm not really the holding kind of Oh!",5,Big Bang Theory,57,12
25429,Howard,21," Oh, guys, I just remembered. I got you some Hawking souvenirs.",5,Big Bang Theory,63,11
25430,Leonard,21, What are these?,5,Big Bang Theory,16,3
25431,Howard,21," Gears and springs from his wheelchair. Pretty cool, huh?",5,Big Bang Theory,57,9
25432,Raj,21," Wow, that's amazing.",5,Big Bang Theory,21,3
25433,Howard,21," Yeah, I made an adjustment on the motor drive and when I was putting it back together I could not for the life of me figure out where they went.",5,Big Bang Theory,145,30
25434,Sheldon,21," I did it. Had to go to three clothing stores, but we finally found a dress that could envelop your mother.",5,Big Bang Theory,107,21
25435,Howard,21, I should have sent you to the custom car cover place in Altadena. They have her pattern on file.,5,Big Bang Theory,97,19
25436,Sheldon,21, Humorous. Now will you please present my paper to Professor Hawking?,5,Big Bang Theory,69,11
25437,Howard,21, I don't know.,5,Big Bang Theory,14,3
25438,Sheldon,21," Oh, for heaven's sake. I did your laundry, I pee-pee-proofed your belt buckles, I, I even sprained my wrist helping your mother lift her bosom.",5,Big Bang Theory,144,25
25439,Howard,21," All right, Sheldon, there's only one thing left I want you to do. Don't worry, it's an easy one.",5,Big Bang Theory,97,19
25440,Sheldon,21, Okay.,5,Big Bang Theory,6,1
25441,Howard,21, Give me a compliment.,5,Big Bang Theory,22,4
25442,Sheldon,21, Fine. You have very tiny hands.,5,Big Bang Theory,32,6
25443,Howard,21," No, about my job. I want you to tell me I'm good at what I do.",5,Big Bang Theory,63,16
25444,Sheldon,21, You're obviously good at what you do.,5,Big Bang Theory,38,7
25445,Howard,21," Well, then why are you always ripping on me?",5,Big Bang Theory,45,9
25446,Sheldon,21," Oh, I understand the confusion. I have never said that you are not good at what you do. It's just that what you do is not worth doing.",5,Big Bang Theory,135,28
25447,Leonard,21, It's nicer than anything he's ever said to me. I'd take it and run.,5,Big Bang Theory,68,14
25448,Howard,21," Thank you, Sheldon.",5,Big Bang Theory,20,3
25449,Sheldon,21, Now will you give my paper to Hawking?,5,Big Bang Theory,39,8
25450,Howard,21," Sorry, I can't.",5,Big Bang Theory,16,3
25451,Sheldon,21," What, why not?",5,Big Bang Theory,15,3
25452,Howard,21, I gave it to him three days ago. He was really impressed. He wants to meet you.,5,Big Bang Theory,80,17
25453,Sheldon,21," All right, then. Thank you, Howard. Please let Professor Hawking know that I'm available at his earliest convenience.",5,Big Bang Theory,118,18
25454,Raj,21, I thought he might be a little more excited.,5,Big Bang Theory,45,9
25455,Leonard,21, Give it a second. ,5,Big Bang Theory,19,4
25457,Sheldon,21," Professor Hawking, it's an honour and a privilege to meet you, sir.",5,Big Bang Theory,68,12
25459,Sheldon,21, I want to thank you for taking time to see me.,5,Big Bang Theory,47,11
25461,Sheldon,21, I know.,5,Big Bang Theory,8,2
25463,Sheldon,21," Thank you. It just, it came to me one morning in the shower.",5,Big Bang Theory,61,13
25465,Sheldon,21, What do you mean wrong?,5,Big Bang Theory,24,5
25467,Sheldon,21," No, no, th-th-th-that can't be right. I-I don't make arithmetic mistakes.",5,Big Bang Theory,74,11
25469,Sheldon,21," Oh, no, no, no, of course not. It's just, I was thinking Oh, gosh, golly, I made a boo-boo, and I gave it to Stephen Hawking.",5,Big Bang Theory,126,26
25472,Sheldon,22," I wish you could all be inside my head. The conversation is sparkling.  Fine, I'll tell you. A lichen is an organism made up of two separate species, fungi and algae. If you could merge with another species, what species would you pick and why? Hint, there is a right answer. None of you will get it.",5,Big Bang Theory,301,57
25473,Raj,22," Okay, uh, I'd pick swan because, uh, the resulting hybrid would have the advanced industrial civilization of a human and the long graceful neck I've always dreamed of having.",5,Big Bang Theory,175,29
25474,Sheldon,22, Wrong. Leonard?,5,Big Bang Theory,16,2
25475,Leonard,22," Horse, but mostly just for the height. A little bit for the genital girth.",5,Big Bang Theory,75,14
25476,Sheldon,22," Wrong, and let's keep it clean, shall we?",5,Big Bang Theory,42,8
25477,Howard,22," Kangaroo, uh, I'd be a Kanga-Jew. The first of my people to dunk a basketball.",5,Big Bang Theory,79,15
25478,Leonard,22," Also instead of just living in your mother's house, you could actually live inside her body.",5,Big Bang Theory,93,16
25479,Sheldon,22," Clever, but also wrong. No, the best organism for human beings to merge with is the lichen itself. That way, you'd be human, fungus, and algae. Triple threat. Like three-bean salad.",5,Big Bang Theory,182,31
25480,Leonard,22, Give me one circumstance in which that would be useful.,5,Big Bang Theory,56,10
25481,Sheldon,22," All right, picture this, a beautiful outdoor concert. Now, as a human, I appreciate Beethoven. As a fungus, I have a terrific view, growing out of a towering maple tree. And no thank you, expensive concessions. Because as an algae, I'll just snack on this sunlight.",5,Big Bang Theory,266,46
25482,Raj,22, He got us again.,5,Big Bang Theory,17,4
25483,Leonard,22," No, he didn't.",5,Big Bang Theory,15,3
25484,Raj,22," Anyway, if it's okay with you, we should talk about Howard's bachelor party.",5,Big Bang Theory,77,13
25485,Sheldon,22," Well, seems like a bit of a let down after our lichen conversation, but, what do you know, you're half swan.",5,Big Bang Theory,109,21
25486,Raj,22," I've been doing some research on strippers. One agency I spoke to, said I could get us a great price if we're flexible on age range and number of limbs.",5,Big Bang Theory,153,30
25487,Howard,22," Sounds like loads of fun, but I promised Bernadette no strippers.",5,Big Bang Theory,66,11
25488,Raj,22, You don't want strippers? You're the king of strippers. The one club in North Hollywood named a pole after you.,5,Big Bang Theory,112,20
25489,Howard,22," What can I tell ya, I'm not into that stuff any more.",5,Big Bang Theory,54,12
25490,Leonard,22," Good for you, Howard. I'm proud of you. And still, you're the first one of us to get married. We have to do something special.",5,Big Bang Theory,127,25
25491,Sheldon,22, You know Germans have an interesting pre-wedding custom.,5,Big Bang Theory,57,8
25492,Howard,22," Well, it's probably not for me.",5,Big Bang Theory,32,6
25493,Raj,22, Maybe we can go up to Napa Valley. They've got that wine train.,5,Big Bang Theory,64,13
25494,Sheldon,22," Boo, wine! But yay, trains. I'm in.",5,Big Bang Theory,36,7
25495,Raj,22," Anyway, it's a beautiful time of year. Uh, you travel through the vineyards. There's a tasting on board. And all the wild flowers are in bloom. It's magic.",5,Big Bang Theory,156,28
25496,Leonard,22," Look at that, in 30 seconds, we went from hiring women to being them.",5,Big Bang Theory,70,14
25498,Penny,22," So, I hear you and the lost boys are having a bachelor party tonight.",5,Big Bang Theory,70,14
25499,Leonard,22," Yeah, just going to a restaurant, get some steaks and scotch. Nothing to worry about.",5,Big Bang Theory,86,15
25500,Penny,22, Why should I worry?,5,Big Bang Theory,20,4
25501,Leonard,22," Well, I don't know. It's a bachelor party. There could be strippers. Wouldn't that make you a little jealous?",5,Big Bang Theory,110,19
25502,Penny,22," Oh, come on Leonard, it's you. What's going to happen? I mean, even if there was a stripper, all you'd do is avoid eye-contact and maybe offer to help her kid with his homework.",5,Big Bang Theory,178,34
25503,Leonard,22," Hey, I am a young man in his sexual prime. Under the right conditions, I-I-I am capable of just, really crazy stuff.",5,Big Bang Theory,117,22
25504,Penny,22, Really? What is the craziest thing you've ever done with a woman? And the time you and I had sex in the ocean does not count.,5,Big Bang Theory,126,26
25505,Leonard,22," Oh, come on, that's got to count. There was a really strong undertow, we could have died.",5,Big Bang Theory,90,17
25506,Penny,22," Well, have fun tonight.",5,Big Bang Theory,24,4
25507,Leonard,22," Oh, I will. There is no telling what might happen.",5,Big Bang Theory,51,10
25508,Penny,22," Yeah, there is.",5,Big Bang Theory,16,3
25509,Leonard,22," You know, there's nothing wrong helping some woman's kid get through their S.A.T.'s.",5,Big Bang Theory,85,13
25511,Leonard,22," Hey, I got to hand it to Raj, he found a really nice spot to have a bachelor party.",5,Big Bang Theory,84,19
25512,Sheldon,22, It's not bad. Unless you compare it to a train; then it stinks.,5,Big Bang Theory,64,13
25513,Leonard,22, Are you drinking whisky?,5,Big Bang Theory,25,4
25514,Sheldon,22," Indeed. If I'm to participate in the social convention that is the stag night, then I must embrace all its components, including tobacco, swear words, and yes, alcohol. Jeepers! That's yucky.",5,Big Bang Theory,192,31
25515,Leonard,22," Whoa, it's a little early to start dropping J-bombs, don't you think?",5,Big Bang Theory,70,12
25517,Leonard,22," Oh, hey, Wil. Nice of you to make it out tonight for Howard.",5,Big Bang Theory,61,13
25519,Sheldon,22," I'm confused. I thought since our reconciliation, I was your friend in this group.",5,Big Bang Theory,83,14
25521,Sheldon,22, Oh. I guess you're just friends with anybody.  Aagh!,5,Big Bang Theory,53,9
25523,Leonard,22," Oh, yeah, no worries.",5,Big Bang Theory,22,4
25525,Leonard,22," Oh, all right.",5,Big Bang Theory,15,3
25527,Leonard,22," Yeah, sure.",5,Big Bang Theory,12,2
25529,Leonard,22, Oh.,5,Big Bang Theory,4,1
25531,Leonard,22," Wow, that's very nice.",5,Big Bang Theory,23,4
25533,Raj,22," Hey, everybody! The bachelor boy has arrived! For he's a jolly good fellow",5,Big Bang Theory,75,13
25536,Howard,22," Actually, Barry, we're not going to have strippers tonight.",5,Big Bang Theory,60,9
25540,Amy,22," This is Maid of Honour Amy Farrah Fowler, bringing you the wedding activities just weeks out from the big day. Let's check in with a beautiful, radiant young woman, and her friend who's about to get married. Ladies, can you tell us what you're doing?",5,Big Bang Theory,251,45
25542,Penny,22," Yeah, we labeled them stop and go.",5,Big Bang Theory,35,7
25543,Amy,22," All right, pivoting to the big question. Bernadette, on your wedding night you'll be consummating your marriage. What do you think your first sexual position will be as husband and wife?",5,Big Bang Theory,187,31
25545,Amy,22, Keeping in mind that whoever's on top may set the tone for the marriage.,5,Big Bang Theory,73,14
25546,Penny,22," Okay, show's over.",5,Big Bang Theory,19,3
25547,Amy,22," Hey, they may conceive a child on their wedding night. Don't you think the kid might get a kick out of knowing how it happened?",5,Big Bang Theory,128,25
25548,Penny,22, I don't care. Ask her things like are you going to take Howard's name? Not who's going to sit on who?,5,Big Bang Theory,102,21
25549,Penny,22," Nice. You know, you should totally get BernadetteMaryAnnRostenkowskiWolowitz.com before someone snaps it up.",5,Big Bang Theory,109,13
25551,Penny,22," Oh, that's cool.",5,Big Bang Theory,17,3
25552,Amy,22," No, it's not. I'll explain it to you later.",5,Big Bang Theory,44,9
25554,Raj,22," May I have your attention, please? We are hear tonight to celebrate the upcoming nuptials of my best friend Howard Wolowitz.",5,Big Bang Theory,125,21
25556,Sheldon,22," And, apparently, Wil Wheaton's best friend.",5,Big Bang Theory,44,6
25558,Sheldon,22, Talk to the hand.,5,Big Bang Theory,18,4
25559,Raj,22, Does anyone have any words they'd like to say about our man of the evening?,5,Big Bang Theory,76,15
25560,Sheldon,22," Yeah, I do. . As is the tradition, I have prepared a series of disrespectful jokes which generate humour at Howard's expense. Prepare to have your ribs tickled. Howard, I always thought you'd be the last one of us to ever get married, because you are so short and unappealing. Am I right? Let's see here. Oh, seriously though, Howard, you're actually one of the most intelligent people I know. And that's a zinger, because you're not. I've always thought that you'd make someone a fine husband someday. Assuming you'd be able to get the parts, and develop the engineering skills to assemble them, which I don't see as likely. Hacha! Okay, let me see here. Okay, kidding aside, Howard, you are a good friend. And I wish you nothing but happiness. Bazinga, I don't!",5,Big Bang Theory,764,135
25561,Leonard,22, Sheldon,5,Big Bang Theory,8,1
25562,Sheldon,22, Doubleazinga! I do! Good luck following that.,5,Big Bang Theory,46,7
25563,Leonard,22," So, Howard Wolowitz tying the knot. Leaving his crazy bachelor days behind. He was a wild one. Well, I guess we all kind of were. I remember this one time, I was with this girl at the beach. We were in the ocean and we started making out. I know, it was crazy. I wasn't even wearing my Aquasocks. Then",5,Big Bang Theory,302,60
25565,Leonard,22, Right. To Howard.,5,Big Bang Theory,18,3
25567,Leonard,22, I totally had sex in the ocean.,5,Big Bang Theory,32,7
25569,Raj,22," Yeah, to Howard. Um, uh, who's next?",5,Big Bang Theory,37,7
25571,Raj,22," Hear, hear.",5,Big Bang Theory,12,2
25573,Raj,22," Okay, uh, anybody else? Huh? No? Okay, it all comes down to me, the best man. Ooh! This grasshopper is kicking my ass-hopper. Okay, when I first came to this country, I-I didn't know how to behave or how to dress, or what was cool, I was pretty lonely. But then I met Howard, and suddenly, my life changed, because we could be lonely together. This man became my whole world.",5,Big Bang Theory,376,71
25575,Raj,22," I'm not done, but thank you.  I think back to all the good times we had, like, uh, when we went camping and spent that night telling each other all our secrets. I told him I'm addicted to pedicures and he told me he lost his virginity to his cousin.",5,Big Bang Theory,250,50
25576,Howard,22, She was my second cousin.,5,Big Bang Theory,26,5
25577,Sheldon,22, And the first woman you ever disappointed sexually. Ba-da-bazinga!,5,Big Bang Theory,67,9
25578,Raj,22," Oh, oh, yeah, and then there was the time when Leonard and I took Howard to Las Vegas and paid a hooker to pretend she was Jewish and that she wanted his little kosher pickle. Of all the Howard humping hookers stories, that one's my favourite!",5,Big Bang Theory,244,46
25579,Howard,22," Okay, buddy, that's it. Sit down.",5,Big Bang Theory,34,6
25580,Raj,22," Oh, oh, what about that tubby girl in the Sailor Moon costume at Comic-con?",5,Big Bang Theory,76,14
25581,Howard,22, Don't remember. Please sit down.,5,Big Bang Theory,33,5
25582,Raj,22," The only threesome I've ever had in my life, and I'm proud to say it was with this man right here.",5,Big Bang Theory,99,21
25583,Howard,22," Oh, please shut up.",5,Big Bang Theory,20,4
25584,Raj,22," Oh, oh, don't get me wrong, nothing happened with me and Howard. There was about 200 pounds of Sailor Moon between us.",5,Big Bang Theory,119,22
25586,Sheldon,22," Jeepers, I'm drunk.",5,Big Bang Theory,20,3
25588,Howard,22," Thank you for picking us up. There's a warning, right there, on the scotch bottle. You cannot be operatin' heavy machinery after you had a snootful of this, laddie!",5,Big Bang Theory,165,29
25590,Howard,22," Yeah, it was great. And low-key, like I promised. No hanky-panky, no strippers. Just the guys telling jokes.",5,Big Bang Theory,109,18
25592,Howard,22," How about you? Did you have a fun night? Yeah, we, uh, made gift bags, had wine, and then went online and saw this.",5,Big Bang Theory,116,24
25594,Raj,22," You know, we're not that far from my apartment. If you stop the car, I can walk from here.",5,Big Bang Theory,91,19
25596,Howard,22," Bernadette, listen",5,Big Bang Theory,19,2
25598,Raj,22," Seriously, you don't even have to stop the car. Anything under ten miles an hour and I can combat-roll into the street.",5,Big Bang Theory,120,22
25599,Howard,22," Okay, just to set the record straight, I didn't hire the prostitute, she was a gift from him. Shame on you, Raj. That is not how we treat women in this country.",5,Big Bang Theory,161,32
25601,Raj,22," Thank you, Bernadette.",5,Big Bang Theory,23,3
25605,Amy,22," I'm curious what's bothering you most, the borderline incest, the prostitute or group sex with the girl dressed as the children's cartoon?",5,Big Bang Theory,139,22
25606,Penny,22," Amy, remember when we went over things that would be helpful and things that wouldn't?",5,Big Bang Theory,87,15
25607,Amy,22, Right. And that was,5,Big Bang Theory,20,4
25608,Penny,22, Not.,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
25610,Penny,22," Well, if that's what you like, I'll take you to the comic book store, the place is full of 'em.",5,Big Bang Theory,96,20
25612,Penny,22," Well, a little. You hear stuff.",5,Big Bang Theory,32,6
25614,Penny,22," Well, I was gonna, but I didn't think it would go past the first date. Then, when it did, I thought for sure it wouldn't go past you meeting his mother. Definitely not past the two of you sleeping together. I mean, the warning signs were there, this is really on you.",5,Big Bang Theory,268,52
25616,Amy,22, I don't think that was helpful.,5,Big Bang Theory,32,6
25618,Howard,22," Hi, Bernie, it's me again. Please call me back.",5,Big Bang Theory,48,9
25619,Raj,22," Dude, I am so sorry.",5,Big Bang Theory,21,5
25620,Howard,22," It's not your fault, it's mine. I did all that stuff, not you.",5,Big Bang Theory,63,13
25621,Leonard,22," Actually, you did do one of them together.",5,Big Bang Theory,43,8
25622,Sheldon,22, Here.,5,Big Bang Theory,6,1
25623,Howard,22, What is this?,5,Big Bang Theory,14,3
25624,Sheldon,22, You're upset. The convention is to bring an upset person a hot beverage.,5,Big Bang Theory,73,13
25625,Howard,22," No, but what is it?",5,Big Bang Theory,20,5
25626,Sheldon,22," Chicken broth. It seemed culturally appropriate. Also, there was a single cube of chicken bouillon in the cupboard when I moved in and it's been bothering me for the last eight years. So, as they say, two birds.",5,Big Bang Theory,212,38
25627,Howard,22, I don't know what my next move is.,5,Big Bang Theory,35,8
25628,Leonard,22," Well, Howard, I don't know much about women.",5,Big Bang Theory,45,8
25629,Howard,22, Yeah?,5,Big Bang Theory,6,1
25630,Leonard,22," No, uh, that, that's it. I don't know much about women. Raj, you got anything?",5,Big Bang Theory,79,15
25631,Raj,22, I've got the phone number of the tubby girl from Comic-Con.,5,Big Bang Theory,60,11
25632,Howard,22, I'm not calling the girl from Comic-con.,5,Big Bang Theory,41,7
25633,Raj,22, All right. More Sailor Moon for me.,5,Big Bang Theory,36,7
25634,Sheldon,22, I just threw up the bachelor party.,5,Big Bang Theory,36,7
25636,Penny,22," Please come out, Bernadette. Let's talk through this.",5,Big Bang Theory,54,8
25638,Amy,22, Perhaps you should give him a taste of his own medicine. Do you have a cousin who you find attractive?,5,Big Bang Theory,103,20
25639,Penny,22, Amy.,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
25640,Amy,22," Hey, you introduced him to the sleazebag. I'm just trying to clean up your mess.",5,Big Bang Theory,81,15
25641,Howard,22," Oh, hi.",5,Big Bang Theory,8,2
25642,Penny,22, Hey.,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
25643,Howard,22, I need to talk to Bernadette.,5,Big Bang Theory,30,6
25644,Penny,22," Well, I don't think she wants to talk to anyone right now.",5,Big Bang Theory,59,12
25645,Howard,22," All right, well, could you at least give her a message?",5,Big Bang Theory,56,11
25646,Penny,22," Yeah, sure, I guess.",5,Big Bang Theory,21,4
25647,Howard,22," Tell her I'm really sorry, and if she doesn't want to marry me, I get it. But what I really want her to know is the guy that she's disgusted by, is the guy that I'm disgusted by, too. But that guy doesn't exist any more, he's gone, and the reason is because of her. So, if this relationship is over, let her know that she made me a better man, and tell her thank you.",5,Big Bang Theory,368,76
25648,Penny,22," Oh, my God, Howard. That's the most beautiful thing I've ever heard. And it came out of you.",5,Big Bang Theory,93,18
25650,Howard,22, Penny has a message for you.,5,Big Bang Theory,29,6
25652,Howard,22, Do you want me to go?,5,Big Bang Theory,22,6
25654,Howard,22, I get that.,5,Big Bang Theory,12,3
25656,Howard,22," Couple things, but, you know, most of them happened overseas. I'll tell you later.",5,Big Bang Theory,83,14
25658,Howard,22," So, is the wedding still on?",5,Big Bang Theory,29,6
25660,Amy,22," Oh, thank God. I'm still a maid of honour. ",5,Big Bang Theory,44,9
25661,Penny,22," Oh, what the hell. ",5,Big Bang Theory,20,4
25662,Amy,22, This is kind of hot.,5,Big Bang Theory,21,5
25664,Leonard,22, Hello.,5,Big Bang Theory,7,1
25665,Penny,22, What's with the robe?,5,Big Bang Theory,22,4
25666,Leonard,22," I'm gonna have sex with you right here, right now, on that washing machine.",5,Big Bang Theory,76,14
25667,Penny,22," No, you're not.",5,Big Bang Theory,16,3
25668,Leonard,22," Come on, please.",5,Big Bang Theory,17,3
25669,Penny,22," If you want to do something, you can help me fold this sheet.",5,Big Bang Theory,62,13
25670,Leonard,22," Folding a sheet in my underwear, still pretty crazy.",5,Big Bang Theory,53,9
25672,Howard,23, Howard Wolowitz.,5,Big Bang Theory,17,2
25674,Howard,23," Yes, yes, I've been doing my push-ups. I'm still stuck at nine, but that's going all the way down with no one holding me.",5,Big Bang Theory,122,24
25676,Howard,23," You're kidding. So what does that mean? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Boy, I got to tell you, I'm really disappointed. This was my dream ever since I was a little kid. Okay, well, uh, thanks for the call. Yep, you, too.  Yes! Thank you! Oh! Oh! I'm not gonna die in space! I'm gonna die the way God intended, in my late 50s, with a heart full of pastrami.",5,Big Bang Theory,342,67
25678,Sheldon,23, I'm going to need a larger shirt. This one's a little tight under the arms.,5,Big Bang Theory,76,15
25680,Leonard,23, Do you think maybe it's tight because you're wearing long underwear?,5,Big Bang Theory,69,11
25681,Sheldon,23," Yes, of course that's why it's tight.",5,Big Bang Theory,38,7
25682,Leonard,23," All right, let me rephrase the question. Why are you wearing long underwear?",5,Big Bang Theory,77,13
25683,Sheldon,23, You're kidding. Shouldn't the question be why aren't you?,5,Big Bang Theory,58,9
25684,Sheldon,23," Leonard, these rental tuxedos have been worn by hundreds of sweaty strangers. I don't like my own sweat touching my skin, how do you think I feel about theirs?",5,Big Bang Theory,160,29
25686,Sheldon,23, Said the hangman offering a noose.,5,Big Bang Theory,35,6
25687,Raj,23," Well, that wasn't as entertaining as when he rents bowling shoes, but it was right up there.",5,Big Bang Theory,93,17
25688,Howard,23," Well, that's it. My orders have been rescinded. I am officially no go to space.",5,Big Bang Theory,80,15
25689,Leonard,23," I'm sorry, Howard, but I got to tell you, I'm a little relieved you're not going.",5,Big Bang Theory,82,16
25690,Howard,23, Why?,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
25691,Leonard,23," Come on, you were gonna go up in a rocket designed in the 1960s by the Russians.",5,Big Bang Theory,81,17
25692,Howard,23," Yeah, so?",5,Big Bang Theory,10,2
25693,Leonard,23," When was the last time you were at Best Buy and you heard someone say, ooh, check out this Blu-ray player, it must be good, it was built in Russiaâ€ù?",5,Big Bang Theory,151,30
25694,Howard,23," Well, their technology isn't that bad.",5,Big Bang Theory,39,6
25695,Raj,23," When you come back to Earth in a Soyuz capsule, you free-fall from space at 500 miles per hour, and the only thing that slows you down is a little parachute that pops out right before you crash into the ground. And the whole thing was designed by the same brilliant minds who were unable to capture Rocky and Bullwinkle.",5,Big Bang Theory,321,60
25696,Howard,23," All right, well, whatever. I wasn't worried.",5,Big Bang Theory,45,7
25697,Raj,23, You weren't?,5,Big Bang Theory,13,2
25698,Howard,23, Let me explain the difference between you and me. You watch Star Trek. I live it.,5,Big Bang Theory,82,16
25699,Raj,23," Oh, please. I don't remember the episode of Star Trek where the guy never goes to space and brags about it in a tuxedo store.",5,Big Bang Theory,126,25
25700,Howard,23," Make all the jokes you want, but there's only one of us here brave enough to almost do what I almost did.",5,Big Bang Theory,106,22
25701,Sheldon,23," Ah, much better.",5,Big Bang Theory,17,3
25702,Leonard,23, You must be burning up.,5,Big Bang Theory,24,5
25703,Sheldon,23," A little. But not more than your urethras will be after whatever's in those pants swims up them. Well, I cut quite the dashing, yet hygienic figure, don't I? I look like the Flash about to get married. Oh! A tissue! A tissue! Oh, good Lord!",5,Big Bang Theory,241,46
25705,Leonard,23, He keeps emergency Purell in the car.,5,Big Bang Theory,38,7
25706,Sheldon,23, Keys! Keys! Keys!,5,Big Bang Theory,18,3
25708,Penny,23," Hey, you.",5,Big Bang Theory,10,2
25709,Leonard,23," Before I come in, you should know, I have gas.  ",5,Big Bang Theory,49,10
25710,Penny,23," For the record, not your worst opening line.",5,Big Bang Theory,45,8
25711,Leonard,23, Check it out. It's the gas I use in my free-electron laser to support high voltages. But it also has an interesting secondary use. Here. Breathe this in.,5,Big Bang Theory,154,28
25712,Penny,23," B-Before I do it, if you're a cop you have tell me, right?",5,Big Bang Theory,59,13
25713,Leonard,23, Just try it.,5,Big Bang Theory,13,3
25714,Penny,23," Okay.  What's it supposed to Oh, my God, this is so freaky!",5,Big Bang Theory,60,12
25715,Leonard,23, You're a mean one Mr. Grinch.,5,Big Bang Theory,30,6
25716,Penny,23," Okay. Me, me, me. Ready?  Leonard, I am your father.",5,Big Bang Theory,53,10
25717,Leonard,23, I have never been more attracted to a woman who sounds like a man in my life.,5,Big Bang Theory,78,17
25718,Penny,23," Oh, Mm. Hey, you know how we've been taking things slow?",5,Big Bang Theory,57,11
25719,Leonard,23, Mm-hmm.,5,Big Bang Theory,8,1
25720,Penny,23," Well, I've been thinking, and maybe I'm ready to take things a little faster.",5,Big Bang Theory,78,14
25721,Leonard,23," Oh, great.",5,Big Bang Theory,11,2
25722,Penny,23, Mm-hmm.,5,Big Bang Theory,8,1
25723,Leonard,23," And I promise, after waiting four months, fast is what you're gonna get.",5,Big Bang Theory,73,13
25724,Penny,23," You know, just-just one thing. Look, we're in a really great place right now, and I don't want to do anything that will make stuff all weird again.",5,Big Bang Theory,148,28
25725,Leonard,23, So we won't let it get weird.,5,Big Bang Theory,30,7
25726,Penny,23," Okay. Oh, and just a heads-up, mm, since the last time you saw me naked, I got a Cookie Monster tattoo. The acceptable responses when you see it are awesome or nothing.",5,Big Bang Theory,169,32
25727,Leonard,23, What about  Cookies!,5,Big Bang Theory,21,3
25729,Sheldon,23,  Amy?  Amy?  Amy?,5,Big Bang Theory,18,3
25730,Amy,23," Seven o'clock, right on time.",5,Big Bang Theory,30,5
25731,Sheldon,23, It's not an accident. I waited outside your door for twenty minutes.,5,Big Bang Theory,69,12
25732,Amy,23," Well, dinner's almost ready.",5,Big Bang Theory,29,4
25733,Sheldon,23," I must say, I was surprised you chose to spend our date night in your apartment. As I mentioned, the Pasadena City Council is debating longer crosswalk times, and later, the LEGO store is having a midnight madness sale. You ask anyone, that's a hot date.",5,Big Bang Theory,255,46
25734,Amy,23," Tempting choices, but I have something special planned for tonight.",5,Big Bang Theory,68,10
25735,Sheldon,23, What can be more special than having an adequate amount of time to cross the street on your way to buy a tiny LEGO Indiana Jones?,5,Big Bang Theory,130,26
25736,Amy,23," With our friends moving forward in their relationships, I've decided that we should make progress in ours as well.",5,Big Bang Theory,115,19
25737,Sheldon,23," Oh, dear Lord. Two years ago, we didn't even know each other, and now I'm in your apartment after dark. How much faster can this thing go?",5,Big Bang Theory,139,27
25738,Amy,23," I had a feeling you'd be reluctant, which is why I'm going to dip into my neurobiological bag of tricks.",5,Big Bang Theory,105,20
25739,Sheldon,23," Oh, you brain monkeys kill me. Dip away.",5,Big Bang Theory,41,8
25740,Amy,23, I have devised an experiment that I believe will increase your feelings for me in an accelerated time frame.,5,Big Bang Theory,109,19
25741,Sheldon,23," And how do you propose to do that? Uh, hope you're not thinking about some sort of LSD thought control. Because there's only one mind-expanding drug that this man enjoys, and that's called school.",5,Big Bang Theory,197,34
25742,Amy,23," Human beings form emotional attachments as they grow up. In your case, to your mother, superheroes, et cetera. I'm going to attempt an experiment that will get you to transfer those feelings to me.",5,Big Bang Theory,198,34
25743,Sheldon,23," Well, seems what's on the menu tonight is malarkey with a big side of poppycock.",5,Big Bang Theory,81,15
25744,Amy,23," We'll see. Let's start with a little romantic dinner music, shall we?",5,Big Bang Theory,70,12
25745,Sheldon,23, Super Mario Bros. theme?,5,Big Bang Theory,25,4
25746,Amy,23, Yes.,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
25747,Sheldon,23," I see what you're doing. You're attempting to build on the work of Ebbinghaus by triggering an involuntary memory of me playing that game, admittedly the happiest 600 hours of my childhood, but it won't work.",5,Big Bang Theory,209,36
25748,Amy,23, Fine. There's no reason we still can't have a lovely dinner. Why don't you have a seat.,5,Big Bang Theory,88,17
25749,Sheldon,23," Da-da-da da-da dum, boink, boink.",5,Big Bang Theory,34,5
25750,Amy,23, May I offer you something to drink?,5,Big Bang Theory,36,7
25751,Sheldon,23, You know I don't drink.,5,Big Bang Theory,24,5
25752,Amy,23, Not even strawberry Quik?,5,Big Bang Theory,26,4
25753,Sheldon,23," I love strawberry Quik. It's my favourite pink fluid, narrowly beating out Pepto-Bismol.",5,Big Bang Theory,89,13
25754,Amy,23," Oh, I know. I think it will go nicely with what I have prepared for dinner.",5,Big Bang Theory,76,16
25755,Sheldon,23, Spaghetti with little pieces of hot dog cut up in it!,5,Big Bang Theory,54,11
25756,Amy,23, Just like your mommy used to make.,5,Big Bang Theory,35,7
25757,Sheldon,23," Oh yummy, yummy! We should do this more often. Uh-oh.",5,Big Bang Theory,54,10
25759,Leonard,23," I'm sorry. I did, I crossed a line. I didn't mean to!",5,Big Bang Theory,54,12
25760,Penny,23, Who says something like that right in the middle of sex?,5,Big Bang Theory,57,11
25761,Leonard,23," I don't know, it just came out. People say weird things during sex all the time.",5,Big Bang Theory,81,16
25762,Penny,23," Okay, well, they sure as hell don't say that.",5,Big Bang Theory,46,9
25763,Leonard,23, It was the heat of the moment.,5,Big Bang Theory,31,7
25764,Penny,23," No, the heat of the moment is, ooh, yeah, just like that, not will you marry me?",5,Big Bang Theory,81,17
25765,Leonard,23," I'm sorry. Just, just give me another chance.",5,Big Bang Theory,46,8
25766,Penny,23," Why, so you can crawl under the covers and go, hey, baby, want to go look for houses in neighbourhoods with good schools?",5,Big Bang Theory,122,23
25767,Leonard,23," Again, I'm sorry. You know, with Howard and Bernadette getting married, I got caught up in a little wedding fever. I take it back.",5,Big Bang Theory,131,24
25768,Penny,23," You can't take something like that back. I mean, what are we even supposed to do now?",5,Big Bang Theory,86,17
25769,Leonard,23," Okay, at some point, we'll look back and this is going to be a funny story. Why don't we just start doing that now?",5,Big Bang Theory,116,24
25770,Penny,23, You're kidding.,5,Big Bang Theory,16,2
25771,Leonard,23," No. Hey, do you remember that time when I proposed to you in bed? And you were all, like, what are you doing? That was so funny. So funny.",5,Big Bang Theory,139,29
25772,Penny,23, It's not funny.,5,Big Bang Theory,16,3
25773,Leonard,23, Give it a minute. Is that a little smile I see there? I should go.,5,Big Bang Theory,67,15
25775,Howard,23," Hey, I was thinking. For our first dance at the wedding, what if we learn the final number from Dirty Dancing?",5,Big Bang Theory,111,21
25777,Howard,23," No, come on. How cool would that be? Me running into your arms, you lifting me up into the air.",5,Big Bang Theory,96,20
25779,Howard,23," Yeah, well, why wouldn't I be? You know, I'm marrying the girl of my dreams, and I finally got my mother to agree not to come on our honeymoon.  Oh, hang on. Oh, it's NASA. Wolowitz. Oh! Hi, Dave. What's up? No kidding. Really? Well, that's great news. Great, great news. All right, I'll watch my e-mail for the details. Okay, talk soon.",5,Big Bang Theory,338,63
25781,Howard,23, It looks like I'm going into space after all.,5,Big Bang Theory,46,9
25783,Howard,23," Uh-huh, wonderful. Yay.",5,Big Bang Theory,24,3
25785,Howard,23," Th-They did. But NASA really wants my telescope up on the space station, so they're putting me on an earlier launch.",5,Big Bang Theory,117,21
25787,Howard,23, A week from Friday.,5,Big Bang Theory,20,4
25789,Howard,23," You're right. I, I can't go to space. I have to get married, and no one can say that's not a good reason. I'll call him back.",5,Big Bang Theory,126,27
25791,Howard,23," Well, too bad, you already did. It's a done deal. Oh, well. But I forgive you.",5,Big Bang Theory,79,16
25793,Howard,23, But what about all the plans and the guests?,5,Big Bang Theory,45,9
25795,Howard,23," You're right, he is! Your dad's gonna be furious. There's no way he's gonna let us postpone this wedding. Well, we tried.",5,Big Bang Theory,122,22
25797,Howard,23," No. I, uh, I should talk to him, man to man.",5,Big Bang Theory,45,11
25799,Howard,23, We can only hope that he doesn't.,5,Big Bang Theory,34,7
25801,Sheldon,23," Bishop to queen four, level two. Check.",5,Big Bang Theory,40,7
25802,Leonard,23," Sheldon, knight takes bishop. You all right?",5,Big Bang Theory,45,7
25803,Sheldon,23, I'm fine.,5,Big Bang Theory,10,2
25804,Leonard,23," Are you? You left your queen exposed from above, you trapped your knight in the corner, and you keep sighing and saying, why me?",5,Big Bang Theory,129,24
25805,Sheldon,23, Very well. Can I ask you a question about women?,5,Big Bang Theory,49,10
25806,Leonard,23, We got you that book last year. Wasn't everything in there?,5,Big Bang Theory,60,11
25807,Sheldon,23," No, I'm having a relationship problem with Amy. And by the way, that book gave me nightmares.",5,Big Bang Theory,94,17
25808,Leonard,23," Well, if it makes you feel any better, I screwed things up pretty good with Penny.",5,Big Bang Theory,83,16
25809,Sheldon,23," Look at us, Leonard, engaging in the social convention of men bellyaching about their ol' ladies.",5,Big Bang Theory,98,16
25810,Leonard,23," I guess we are. So, what's going on?",5,Big Bang Theory,37,8
25811,Sheldon,23," Believe it or not, Amy has embarked on a campaign to increase my feelings for her by making me happy.",5,Big Bang Theory,102,20
25812,Leonard,23," I'm sorry, that must be very difficult for you.",5,Big Bang Theory,48,9
25813,Sheldon,23," It's awful. This morning, she arranged for me to be an Amtrak junior conductor for the day. It, it's usually only open to children. She got them to make an exception.",5,Big Bang Theory,167,31
25814,Leonard,23, Shame on her.,5,Big Bang Theory,14,3
25815,Sheldon,23," They let me blow the whistle, Leonard.",5,Big Bang Theory,39,7
25816,Leonard,23, She's good.,5,Big Bang Theory,12,2
25817,Sheldon,23, I know. And it gets worse. Her efforts are causing me to have affectionate feelings for her at inappropriate times.,5,Big Bang Theory,116,20
25818,Leonard,23," You mean, like in bed or in the shower?",5,Big Bang Theory,40,9
25819,Sheldon,23," No! Would you please stop referencing that infernal book? For example, this morning, I was calculating the random motion of virtual particles in a vacuum, when suddenly the particles morphed into an image of Amy's dandruff gently cascading down onto her pale, slightly hunched shoulders. Oh, what has that vixen done to me, Leonard? And how do I make it stop?",5,Big Bang Theory,360,61
25820,Leonard,23," Well, if you had a physical relationship, I'd say propose during sex. Turns out that's a real mood killer.",5,Big Bang Theory,107,19
25821,Sheldon,23, I assume we're talking about you now?,5,Big Bang Theory,38,7
25822,Leonard,23, Yeah.,5,Big Bang Theory,6,1
25823,Sheldon,23," So, that's how this works? I complain, and then you complain, and no one offers any solutions?",5,Big Bang Theory,95,17
25824,Leonard,23, Pretty much.,5,Big Bang Theory,13,2
25825,Sheldon,23," Well, no wonder the women are winning.",5,Big Bang Theory,39,7
25827,Howard,23," Mr. Rostenkowski, are you busy?",5,Big Bang Theory,32,5
25829,Howard,23," Family pictures, or holy crap, that's a dead person.",5,Big Bang Theory,53,9
25831,Howard,23, I'm not sure.,5,Big Bang Theory,14,3
25833,Howard,23," How about that. Anyway, sir, I need to talk to you about something.",5,Big Bang Theory,68,13
25835,Howard,23," No, thank you. I'm allergic.",5,Big Bang Theory,29,5
25837,Howard,23, From nuts?,5,Big Bang Theory,11,2
25839,Howard,23," Nice story. Anyway, the reason I wanted to talk to you is NASA has moved up my launch to the International Space Station.",5,Big Bang Theory,122,23
25841,Howard,23," So, the date is going to conflict with me marrying your daughter. Now, I know what you're going to say, I made a commitment to Bernadette and to your family and I've got a hell of a lot of nerve coming in here and demanding that we postpone this thing. Well, message heard and understood. Mission cancelled. Thank you.",5,Big Bang Theory,319,59
25843,Howard,23, I'm sorry. May I be excused?,5,Big Bang Theory,29,6
25845,Howard,23," I'm sorry, I didn't know, is this going to Well, I should sit May I be seat Well, I'll just sit.",5,Big Bang Theory,97,21
25847,Howard,23," I'm aware of that, sir.",5,Big Bang Theory,24,5
25849,Howard,23, Uh-huh.,5,Big Bang Theory,8,1
25851,Howard,23," Right, right.",5,Big Bang Theory,14,2
25853,Howard,23," Oh, I am. And just so you know, I'd still be an astronaut, even if I didn't go to space. I've got an I.D. Card and a NASA golf shirt.",5,Big Bang Theory,134,30
25855,Howard,23, But what about the wedding and all the money you put down for the reception?,5,Big Bang Theory,77,15
25857,Howard,23," Um, okay.",5,Big Bang Theory,10,2
25859,Howard,23," All right, look, I'm gonna level with you. I'm terrified about going into space. What if I don't make it back?",5,Big Bang Theory,111,21
25861,Howard,23, You really think so?,5,Big Bang Theory,21,4
25864,Penny,23, Hey.,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
25865,Leonard,23, Hey. Off to work?,5,Big Bang Theory,18,4
25866,Penny,23, Yeah.,5,Big Bang Theory,6,1
25867,Leonard,23, Have a nice night.,5,Big Bang Theory,19,4
25868,Penny,23," Okay, you, too.",5,Big Bang Theory,16,3
25869,Leonard,23," Penny, just, wait. I've been thinking about what I said when we were in bed the other night.",5,Big Bang Theory,93,18
25870,Penny,23," Yeah, I've been thinking about it, too.",5,Big Bang Theory,40,7
25871,Leonard,23, I noticed you never answered me.,5,Big Bang Theory,33,6
25872,Penny,23, You're right.  No.,5,Big Bang Theory,19,3
25873,Leonard,23," Uh, follow-up. Are we still dating?",5,Big Bang Theory,36,6
25874,Penny,23, Yep.,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
25875,Leonard,23, Is it still weird 'cause I proposed?,5,Big Bang Theory,37,7
25876,Penny,23, Yep.,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
25877,Leonard,23, I have a couple more quick questions. Do you want to call me from the car?,5,Big Bang Theory,75,16
25878,Penny,23, No!,5,Big Bang Theory,4,1
25879,Leonard,23, I played that pretty well. ,5,Big Bang Theory,28,5
25880,Amy,23," Hello, Leonard.",5,Big Bang Theory,16,2
25881,Leonard,23, What are you doing?,5,Big Bang Theory,20,4
25882,Amy,23, We're playing doctor. Star Trek style.,5,Big Bang Theory,39,6
25883,Sheldon,23," I'm in hell, Leonard. Don't stop.",5,Big Bang Theory,34,6
25889,Howard,24, Hey Mike?,5,Big Bang Theory,10,2
25891,Howard,24, I changed my mind. I don't want to do this.,5,Big Bang Theory,44,10
25893,Howard,24," Yeah, I'm a funny guy. I also have a hysterical bit planned for later where I pretend to cry through the whole launch.",5,Big Bang Theory,119,23
25895,Leonard,24," Sheldon, what channel is NASA TV?",5,Big Bang Theory,34,6
25896,Sheldon,24," 289, right between the Game Show Network at 288 and the East coast feed of the Disney Channel on 290.",5,Big Bang Theory,102,20
25897,Amy,24," I love his eidetic memory, it's so sexy. Sheldon, what are the ingredients in Pringles?",5,Big Bang Theory,88,15
25898,Sheldon,24," Dried potatoes, vegetable oil, corn flower, wheat starch, maltodextrin, salt, and my favourite ingredient of all, uniformity.",5,Big Bang Theory,126,17
25899,Amy,24," The uterus quivers, does it not?",5,Big Bang Theory,33,6
25900,Leonard,24," There's Howard's rocket, live from Kazakhstan.",5,Big Bang Theory,47,6
25902,Raj,24, You're nervous? I've been stress-eating for four days. Look at me. I'm wearing my fat pants.,5,Big Bang Theory,93,16
25903,Sheldon,24," Remarkable. In just under a half hour, 200 metric tons of fuel will ignite in a controlled explosion right beneath Howard's keister. And all from a country whose entire contribution to the global economy, has been Tetris and mail-order brides.",5,Big Bang Theory,244,40
25909,Howard,24," Good! Good! Oh, quick question, I missed it in the briefing. How much urine do these suits hold?",5,Big Bang Theory,97,18
25912,Howard,24, Check.,5,Big Bang Theory,7,1
25914,Howard,24," No, it's 'cause I live with my mom and she makes me Froot Loops.",5,Big Bang Theory,65,14
25918,Howard,24," Thanks, we decided to do it before the launch.",5,Big Bang Theory,47,9
25920,Howard,24," Not exactly. Listen, if you don't mind, I'm not really up for chatting. I'm just going to sit here quietly and let my life flash before my eyes. That went really quick. Let me try it again.",5,Big Bang Theory,190,37
25922,Howard,24, Close your eyes. Put out your hand. I got you something special.,5,Big Bang Theory,65,12
25924,Howard,24," No, here.",5,Big Bang Theory,10,2
25926,Howard,24," Okay, but I'm going to have to get it back from you so I can take it to the International Space Station. That way, when I come home, you will have a star that was actually in space.",5,Big Bang Theory,182,38
25928,Howard,24," Take that, every guy who's ever bought you anything.",5,Big Bang Theory,53,9
25930,Howard,24," Really? Well, if you like it that much, then close your eyes and put out your hand.",5,Big Bang Theory,84,17
25932,Howard,24," No! When I eat Froot Loops, the other astronauts make fun of me!",5,Big Bang Theory,65,13
25934,Howard,24, What?,5,Big Bang Theory,6,1
25936,Howard,24, But I'm leaving in two days.,5,Big Bang Theory,29,6
25938,Howard,24, I don't need to take cereal.,5,Big Bang Theory,29,6
25940,Howard,24, They invented blintzes. I'll be fine.,5,Big Bang Theory,38,6
25943,Howard,24, Wow. Okay. Let's get married.,5,Big Bang Theory,30,5
25947,Leonard,24, That's so great. ,5,Big Bang Theory,18,3
25948,Howard,24," I mean, we know it's short notice, but we'd love you all to come with us.",5,Big Bang Theory,74,16
25949,Amy,24," No, no, no, this is not the wedding I wanted! I want to wear my maid of honour dress and walk down the aisle with a hundred eyes on me, while a string quartet plays The Way You Look Tonight.",5,Big Bang Theory,191,40
25951,Amy,24," Well, it was going to be mine.",5,Big Bang Theory,31,7
25952,Sheldon,24," Thank you for the invitation, but I have to decline because it doesn't sound like something I'll enjoy.",5,Big Bang Theory,104,18
25953,Leonard,24," Come on, Sheldon, it'll be fun.",5,Big Bang Theory,32,6
25954,Sheldon,24, That's what you said about The Green Lantern movie. You were 114 minutes of wrong.,5,Big Bang Theory,83,15
25956,Amy,24, Can I wear my maid of honour dress?,5,Big Bang Theory,36,8
25958,Amy,24," It's all I have left. You're going to take that from me, too?",5,Big Bang Theory,62,13
25960,Penny,24," Amy, you look great.",5,Big Bang Theory,21,4
25961,Amy,24, I know.,5,Big Bang Theory,8,2
25962,Leonard,24, Where'd you get a beer?,5,Big Bang Theory,24,5
25963,Raj,24," From that happy young couple over there with all the tattoos. Beautiful story, they're in rival drug gangs, and they're getting married. Shh, no one can know.",5,Big Bang Theory,159,27
25964,Amy,24," Look at all these people in love. It kind of gets you thinking, doesn't it?",5,Big Bang Theory,76,15
25965,Sheldon,24," It does, indeed. Leonard, is it awkward being here with Penny given that you recently proposed to her?",5,Big Bang Theory,103,18
25966,Howard,24, You proposed to Penny?,5,Big Bang Theory,23,4
25967,Leonard,24, I don't want to talk about it.,5,Big Bang Theory,31,7
25968,Raj,24, Where did he pop the question? What did you say?,5,Big Bang Theory,49,10
25969,Leonard,24," She said no, can we drop it now?",5,Big Bang Theory,33,8
25970,Penny,24, It wasn't a real proposal.,5,Big Bang Theory,27,5
25972,Sheldon,24, He asked her during coitus.,5,Big Bang Theory,28,5
25973,Howard,24, Did you get down on one knee or were you already there?,5,Big Bang Theory,56,12
25975,Howard,24," I'm sorry, Ma Bernadette. Ma Burna You're ma Bernadette.",5,Big Bang Theory,57,9
25976,Penny,24, Good move telling Sheldon.,5,Big Bang Theory,27,4
25977,Leonard,24," What, I can't propose? I can't talk to my friends? Is there anything else I'm not allowed to do?",5,Big Bang Theory,97,19
25978,Amy,24," All right, that's enough. Today is not about you two. Today is about Howard and Bernadette and me.",5,Big Bang Theory,99,18
25981,Howard,24," I got this. Excuse me, but is there any way you could squeeze us in? See, I'm an astronaut and I'm leaving for Russia on Sunday so I can take a Soyuz rocket to the International Space Station.",5,Big Bang Theory,193,38
25984,Amy,24," Excuse me, I'm going to go see if the couple at the front of the line needs a maid of honour.",5,Big Bang Theory,94,21
25989,Howard,24," Uh, shouldn't you guys be talking about space stuff instead of dogs?",5,Big Bang Theory,69,12
25993,Howard,24, Thanks.,5,Big Bang Theory,8,1
25995,Howard,24," You know, we could always drive to Vegas and get married.",5,Big Bang Theory,58,11
25997,Penny,24," Hey, I know tons of people who got married in Vegas.",5,Big Bang Theory,53,11
25999,Penny,24," Yeah, I mean, not to the same people but",5,Big Bang Theory,41,9
26001,Sheldon,24," Leonard, where did you envision marrying Penny?",5,Big Bang Theory,48,7
26002,Leonard,24, Will you shut up?,5,Big Bang Theory,18,4
26003,Raj,24," Well, I know how to make it special.",5,Big Bang Theory,37,8
26004,Howard,24, I told you we are not recreating the wedding from The Sound of Music.,5,Big Bang Theory,70,14
26005,Raj,24," Yes, you made that brutally clear to me. What I was going to suggest is if that you're willing to wait until Sunday morning, the Google satellite will be over Pasadena. You can have a wedding photograph from space.",5,Big Bang Theory,215,39
26007,Leonard,24, That's so cool.,5,Big Bang Theory,16,3
26008,Howard,24," Oh, wait to go, Raj.",5,Big Bang Theory,21,5
26009,Raj,24," I keep telling you, if I wasn't an astrophysicist, I would have been a party planner. It was always a coin flip.",5,Big Bang Theory,113,22
26010,Howard,24," Okay, so we know we're going to do it Sunday morning. Now we need to find a good place for the satellite to see us.",5,Big Bang Theory,116,25
26011,Leonard,24, How about our roof?,5,Big Bang Theory,20,4
26013,Howard,24, That's great.,5,Big Bang Theory,14,2
26014,Amy,24," Oh, my gosh. I can't believe my maid of honour dress is going to be on Google Earth.",5,Big Bang Theory,85,18
26015,Howard,24," So, we have the where and the when, but we still need to figure out who's going to do the ceremony.",5,Big Bang Theory,100,21
26016,Penny,24," Well, that's easy. Anyone can go online and get ordained as a minister. I know a piercing parlour where, for a hundred bucks they'll marry you and stick a wedding ring through any body part you want.",5,Big Bang Theory,200,37
26018,Sheldon,24," I'll do it, provided I can perform the ceremony in Klingon.",5,Big Bang Theory,60,11
26020,Sheldon,24, What do you see in her?,5,Big Bang Theory,24,6
26023,Howard,24, Leaking? What's leaking?,5,Big Bang Theory,25,3
26027,Howard,24, There's fuel leaking and we're still going to go?,5,Big Bang Theory,50,9
26030,Howard,24, What happens on the tenth time?,5,Big Bang Theory,32,6
26033,Howard,24," Hey, guys, before I forget, I got you a little groomsman present.",5,Big Bang Theory,66,12
26034,Raj,24," Oh, thanks, man.",5,Big Bang Theory,17,3
26035,Sheldon,24, You didn't have to do that.,5,Big Bang Theory,28,6
26036,Howard,24," Fantastic Four, annual number three from 1965, in mint condition. The one where Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Girl get married.",5,Big Bang Theory,130,21
26037,Leonard,24," Oh, wow.",5,Big Bang Theory,9,2
26038,Sheldon,24," Oh, dear. I was afraid of this.",5,Big Bang Theory,32,7
26039,Howard,24, What?,5,Big Bang Theory,6,1
26040,Sheldon,24," While a thoughtful gift, this comic book in this condition is worth at least a hundred dollars.",5,Big Bang Theory,96,17
26041,Howard,24," Yeah, so?",5,Big Bang Theory,10,2
26042,Sheldon,24," I bought you and Bernadette a gravy boat worth eighty-eight dollars. Which places me in your debt and I can't be in your debt because someday you might ask me to help you move, or to kill a man.",5,Big Bang Theory,195,39
26043,Leonard,24, I doubt he'll ask you to kill a man.,5,Big Bang Theory,37,9
26044,Sheldon,24," Well, what if it's his only way out? I can't risk it. Here is twelve dollars. Now, we're even. Wait, wait, wait, I bought a card. Give me two dollars. And for the record, this is why I hate gift-giving.",5,Big Bang Theory,203,40
26046,Amy,24, Who is it?,5,Big Bang Theory,11,3
26047,Howard,24, It's the groom.,5,Big Bang Theory,16,3
26048,Amy,24, Can't come in. Bad luck to see the bride.,5,Big Bang Theory,42,9
26049,Howard,24," Okay, uh, fine. Bernie, I have to go pick up my mother. I'll be right back.",5,Big Bang Theory,76,16
26051,Howard,24, She doesn't want to sit in her dress and wrinkle it so I'm going to lay her down in the back of my neighbour's van.,5,Big Bang Theory,116,25
26053,Howard,24," Okay, I'll see you later, Ma uh lovely bride-to-be. I really got to watch that.",5,Big Bang Theory,80,15
26055,Leonard,24," Come on, Raj, we're ready to start.",5,Big Bang Theory,36,7
26056,Raj,24," What, we're ready when I say we're ready. Uh-du-du-du, ooh, okay, now we're ready.",5,Big Bang Theory,83,14
26057,Howard,24," Ma, you want to move your chair over here so you can see?",5,Big Bang Theory,58,13
26059,Howard,24, You'll fall through the roof before you fall off it.,5,Big Bang Theory,53,10
26060,Raj,24, Penny.  ,5,Big Bang Theory,9,1
26066,Raj,24," Howard and Bernadette, the five of us stand before you as your friends and newly ordained ministers.",5,Big Bang Theory,101,17
26069,Raj,24," Guys, when I look at the two of you starting your lives together, it fills my heart, It fills my, heart, okay, I'm going to need a minute.",5,Big Bang Theory,139,28
26070,Penny,24," Okay, I'll, I'll go. Howard and Bernadette, I know you two planned on getting married in a big fancy wedding, but when you're in love, it doesn't matter where or how these things happen. It just matters that you have each other.",5,Big Bang Theory,229,42
26071,Leonard,24, Hmm.,5,Big Bang Theory,5,1
26072,Penny,24, Problem?,5,Big Bang Theory,9,1
26073,Leonard,24, No.,5,Big Bang Theory,4,1
26074,Sheldon,24, I think the Reverend Hofstadter is making an ironic connection between your statement about love and your rejection of his proposal in the bedroom.,5,Big Bang Theory,148,24
26075,Penny,24," Oh, grow up.",5,Big Bang Theory,13,3
26076,Leonard,24," Hey, I didn't say it.",5,Big Bang Theory,22,5
26077,Amy,24," All right, that's enough from the both of you.",5,Big Bang Theory,47,9
26078,Penny,24," Well, he started it.",5,Big Bang Theory,21,4
26079,Amy,24," Well, I'm ending it. Bernadette, I want to thank you for allowing me to be your maid of honour. I also want you to know, that I will be happy to do it again if this marriage craps out.",5,Big Bang Theory,185,39
26080,Leonard,24," Thank you, Amy. Very touching. Howard and Bernadette, you are lucky enough to be best friends who love each other. And that's the strongest kind of love because at its core, it has kindness, patience, and respect. Qualities that are hard to find in people these days.",5,Big Bang Theory,268,47
26081,Sheldon,24," Would you like some aloe vera? You just got burned. All right, my turn. Howard, Bernadette. Daq tu' taH Daq yIn tlhej ghajtaH.",5,Big Bang Theory,127,23
26083,Sheldon,24," Fine, I'll do it in English, but it loses something. The need to find another human being to share one's life with has always puzzled me. Maybe because I'm so interesting all by myself. With that being said, may you find as much happiness with each other as I find on my own. The Klingon would have made you cry.",5,Big Bang Theory,313,60
26084,Raj,24, I believe you two have prepared vows?,5,Big Bang Theory,38,7
26086,Howard,24, Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski.,5,Big Bang Theory,33,3
26088,Howard,24," Hey, from now on, she's the only women who can yell at me! Until I met you, I couldn't imagine spending my life with just one person. And now I can't imagine spending one day of it without you.",5,Big Bang Theory,194,39
26090,Sheldon,24, And the Klingon High Council,5,Big Bang Theory,29,5
26095,Howard,24, I have strongly mixed feelings.,5,Big Bang Theory,32,5
26098,Penny,24, Did I miss it?,5,Big Bang Theory,15,4
26099,Leonard,24," No, come on in. Hurry.",5,Big Bang Theory,23,5
26101,Raj,24," Me, too.",5,Big Bang Theory,9,2
26102,Penny,24," I can't believe it. This whole time, a small part of me thought he was lying.",5,Big Bang Theory,78,16
26103,Leonard,24, This is it.,5,Big Bang Theory,12,3
26104,Sheldon,24," Boldly go, Howard Wolowitz.",5,Big Bang Theory,28,4
26105,Howard,24, Oy vay!,5,Big Bang Theory,8,2
26110,Leonard,1," Mm-hmm, International Space Station. 250 miles that way.",6,Big Bang Theory,57,8
26111,Raj,1," Right now, Howard's staring down at our planet like a tiny Jewish Greek god. Zeusowitz.",6,Big Bang Theory,88,15
26112,Sheldon,1," I must admit, I can't help but feel a twinge of envy. He can look out the window and see the majesty of the universe unfolding before his eyes. His dim, uncomprehending eyes. It's like a cat in an airport carrying case.",6,Big Bang Theory,220,42
26113,Leonard,1," You know, it's not exactly glamorous up there. The water that the astronauts drink is made from each other's recycled urine.",6,Big Bang Theory,125,21
26115,Raj,1, I wonder what he's doing right this very second.,6,Big Bang Theory,49,9
26116,Leonard,1," Mm, conducting experiments in zero gravity.",6,Big Bang Theory,44,6
26117,Raj,1, Peering through his telescope at the birth of the cosmos.,6,Big Bang Theory,58,10
26118,Sheldon,1," Whatever it is, we know his life will never be the same.",6,Big Bang Theory,57,12
26121,Howard,1," I can hear you without the phone,",6,Big Bang Theory,34,7
26123,Howard,1," I'm excited to talk to you, too.",6,Big Bang Theory,33,7
26125,Howard,1, How about calling her my wife?,6,Big Bang Theory,31,6
26127,Howard,1, They do. That's why we marry them.,6,Big Bang Theory,35,7
26129,Howard,1," Ma, please. Everyone from NASA is listening to this phone call.",6,Big Bang Theory,64,11
26131,Howard,1," Okay, Ma, great talking to you. Gotta go. Well, space is ruined.",6,Big Bang Theory,65,12
26133,Amy,1," This is so exciting. Soon, my upper lip will be the same fake blonde as my beautiful best friend.",6,Big Bang Theory,98,19
26134,Penny,1," Hey, this is my natural hair colour. Now. So, does Sheldon have anything special planned for you tomorrow night?",6,Big Bang Theory,113,19
26135,Amy,1," Oh, yes. According to the Relationship Agreement, on the anniversary of our first date, he must take me to a nice dinner, ask about my day and engage in casual physical contact that a disinterested onlooker might mistake for intimacy.",6,Big Bang Theory,235,40
26136,Penny,1, That's hot. You kids better use protection.,6,Big Bang Theory,44,7
26137,Amy,1, How long does this stay on?,6,Big Bang Theory,28,6
26138,Penny,1, Just a couple of minutes. You've really never done this before?,6,Big Bang Theory,64,11
26139,Amy,1," Once in high school, but I dozed off and woke up with second-degree chemical burns on my face.",6,Big Bang Theory,95,18
26140,Penny,1," Oh, my gosh, that's awful. The other kids make fun of you?",6,Big Bang Theory,59,12
26141,Amy,1," No, I had a cover story, I told everyone it was herpes. So, how's everything going with you and Leonard?",6,Big Bang Theory,105,20
26142,Penny,1," Uh, I don't know, it's still kind of weird. We haven't really recovered since he proposed to me in the middle of sex.",6,Big Bang Theory,118,23
26143,Amy,1," Oh, boo-hoo. If Sheldon proposed to me during sex, my ovaries would grab on to him and never let go.",6,Big Bang Theory,101,20
26145,Sheldon,1," Leonard, where do you stand on the anthropic principle?",6,Big Bang Theory,56,9
26146,Leonard,1," Interesting question. On the one hand, I always thought",6,Big Bang Theory,56,9
26147,Sheldon,1," You don't even know what it is, do you? The anthropic principle states that if we wish to explain why our universe exists the way it does, the answer is that it must have qualities that allow intelligent creatures to arise who are capable of asking the question. As I am doing so eloquently right now.",6,Big Bang Theory,302,56
26148,Leonard,1, I know what the anthropic principle is.,6,Big Bang Theory,40,7
26149,Sheldon,1," Of course. I just explained it to you. Now, where do you stand on it?",6,Big Bang Theory,70,15
26150,Leonard,1, Where do you stand on it? ,6,Big Bang Theory,27,6
26151,Sheldon,1, Strongly pro.,6,Big Bang Theory,14,2
26152,Leonard,1," Then I believe that God created the world in six days, and on the seventh he made you to annoy me.",6,Big Bang Theory,99,21
26153,Raj,1," Hey, guys.",6,Big Bang Theory,11,2
26154,Leonard,1, Hey.,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
26155,Sheldon,1," Yeah, wait, Raj, where do you stand on the anthropic principle?",6,Big Bang Theory,64,11
26156,Raj,1, I'm all for it.,6,Big Bang Theory,16,4
26157,Sheldon,1, Attaboy!,6,Big Bang Theory,9,1
26158,Leonard,1," Well, hang on. Why do you believe that he knows what it is and I don't?",6,Big Bang Theory,72,16
26159,Sheldon,1," Oh, Leonard. Let's not take a saw to the branch we're sitting on, shall we?",6,Big Bang Theory,76,15
26160,Raj,1," Hey, uh, if you guys are free tonight, I heard about a spa where you soak your feet n a pool full of little fish that eat all the dead skin right off them. I don't need to tell you in Los Angeles, sandal season is year round.",6,Big Bang Theory,226,48
26161,Leonard,1," Actually, I'm hanging out with Penny. ",6,Big Bang Theory,39,6
26162,Raj,1," Oh, okay. Sounds like it's me and you, Sheldon. How about we sic some guppies on those puppies?",6,Big Bang Theory,96,18
26163,Sheldon,1," As I've stated before on numerous occasions, the only sea creature I would even consider being eaten by is the Kraken, because the last words I would hear are â€œRelease the Kraken.â€ù That never gets old. â€œRelease the Kraken!â€ù Oh, chills. Besides, I'm having dinner with Amy.",6,Big Bang Theory,281,47
26164,Raj,1," Oh, okay. I'll just go home and be alone. Which is cool. I eat alone, I sleep alone, I cry alone, so, cool.",6,Big Bang Theory,108,23
26165,Sheldon,1," Darn. If you weren't busy, I'd ask you to join us.",6,Big Bang Theory,51,11
26166,Raj,1, Really? I can come? Thanks.,6,Big Bang Theory,28,5
26167,Leonard,1," Sheldon, are you sure you want to be bringing Raj on your date night with Amy?",6,Big Bang Theory,79,16
26168,Sheldon,1," Oh, absolutely. I have a contractual obligation to provide Amy with conversation and casual physical contact, but nowhere is it specified that I can't outsource that to an Indian.",6,Big Bang Theory,180,29
26171,Howard,1," Hey, there's my beautiful bride. Can you see me?",6,Big Bang Theory,49,9
26173,Howard,1," I'm amazing. I mean, this is even better than I dreamed. I look out the window, and it's all so unbelievable.",6,Big Bang Theory,110,21
26175,Howard,1," Oh, yeah? That's nice.",6,Big Bang Theory,23,4
26177,Howard,1," Hey, look, this pen is floating. How crazy is that?",6,Big Bang Theory,52,10
26179,Howard,1," Okay, okay, I know you're upset, but let me share something I've learned since I got here. You realize how small your problems are when you're looking down on them from space. Now, come on, that's got to make you feel better.",6,Big Bang Theory,226,42
26181,Howard,1, Pretty clear.,6,Big Bang Theory,14,2
26183,Howard,1," I mean, it's not, like, HD quality.",6,Big Bang Theory,36,7
26187,Amy,1," Sheldon, this place is so romantic. ",6,Big Bang Theory,37,6
26188,Sheldon,1," Oh, I'm glad you like it. Raj picked it out.",6,Big Bang Theory,45,10
26189,Amy,1," Well, when you see him, tell him I say thank you.",6,Big Bang Theory,50,11
26190,Sheldon,1, Tell him yourself.,6,Big Bang Theory,19,3
26191,Raj,1, Yoo-hoo! Over here!,6,Big Bang Theory,20,3
26192,Amy,1, I don't understand. What's he doing here?,6,Big Bang Theory,42,7
26193,Sheldon,1, I invited him.,6,Big Bang Theory,15,3
26194,Amy,1," On our date? Sheldon, that's not okay.",6,Big Bang Theory,39,7
26195,Sheldon,1," Yes, it is. There's a loophole in the Relationship Agreement.",6,Big Bang Theory,62,10
26196,Amy,1, You found a loophole?,6,Big Bang Theory,22,4
26197,Raj,1, Sorry I started without you. I'm a little nervous. It's been a long time since I've been on a date.,6,Big Bang Theory,100,20
26198,Amy,1, I can't believe I bleached my moustache for this.,6,Big Bang Theory,50,9
26199,Raj,1, You should go to my girl. She'll knock out those sideburns for free.,6,Big Bang Theory,69,13
26200,Raj,1," You know, Amy, I don't even think you and I have had a real conversation. Let's use tonight to get to know each other a little better. You start.",6,Big Bang Theory,146,29
26201,Amy,1, Go home.,6,Big Bang Theory,9,2
26202,Raj,1, I don't understand.,6,Big Bang Theory,20,3
26203,Amy,1," Sheldon, how could you do this? It's our second anniversary.",6,Big Bang Theory,61,10
26204,Raj,1," It's your anniversary? Oh, my God, I had no idea. Amy, please, let me make this right. ",6,Big Bang Theory,88,17
26205,Amy,1, Thank you.,6,Big Bang Theory,11,2
26206,Raj,1," My pleasure. Waiter? A bottle of champagne and three glasses. Oh, boy, isn't this romantic?",6,Big Bang Theory,92,15
26207,Sheldon,1," Oh, I hope that's a rhetorical question, because I have no clue.",6,Big Bang Theory,65,12
26209,Penny,1, This is great. What's the occasion?,6,Big Bang Theory,36,6
26210,Leonard,1," No occasion. You know, things have been a little weird between us, so I wanted to throw together a fun night just for you.",6,Big Bang Theory,123,24
26211,Penny,1, That is so sweet.,6,Big Bang Theory,18,4
26212,Leonard,1," I got all your favourites. Beer, wings, sliders. We can watch the football game. I even painted my stomach.",6,Big Bang Theory,108,19
26213,Penny,1, Go Sports?,6,Big Bang Theory,11,2
26214,Leonard,1," Well, in case you were in the mood for baseball, I didn't want to look ridiculous.",6,Big Bang Theory,83,16
26215,Penny,1, This is awesome. I love it!,6,Big Bang Theory,28,6
26216,Leonard,1," Good, I'm glad. ",6,Big Bang Theory,17,3
26217,Penny,1," Gosh, I worked my ass off today. This is exactly what I needed.",6,Big Bang Theory,64,13
26218,Leonard,1, Great. Just relax and enjoy. Tonight is all about you.,6,Big Bang Theory,55,10
26219,Penny,1," Ah, thank you!",6,Big Bang Theory,15,3
26220,Leonard,1," So, where exactly are we in this relationship?",6,Big Bang Theory,47,8
26221,Penny,1," Oh, come on. I just told you I had a hard day.",6,Big Bang Theory,47,12
26222,Leonard,1," You're right, I'm sorry. Let's watch the game. ",6,Big Bang Theory,48,8
26223,Penny,1, Great.,6,Big Bang Theory,7,1
26224,Leonard,1," I just know the longer we wait to talk about it, the weirder it gets.",6,Big Bang Theory,70,15
26225,Penny,1," Sweetie, can I just be the girl tonight?",6,Big Bang Theory,41,8
26226,Leonard,1," Absolutely. You're the girl, I'm the guy. Now, you watch your football game while I make you a little plate here.",6,Big Bang Theory,114,21
26227,Penny,1, Thank you. ,6,Big Bang Theory,12,2
26228,Leonard,1," Oh, I'll get it. Go sports.",6,Big Bang Theory,28,6
26229,Raj,1, Hello-lo-lo.,6,Big Bang Theory,13,1
26230,Leonard,1, What are you doing here? I thought you were out with Sheldon and Amy.,6,Big Bang Theory,70,14
26231,Raj,1," I was, but it's their anniversary and I didn't want to be a third wheel, so I figured I'd come over here and hang out with you and Penny on your date.",6,Big Bang Theory,151,32
26232,Leonard,1," Well, it's not really a great time. Penny and I have some things we need to talk about.",6,Big Bang Theory,88,18
26233,Penny,1," No, we don't! Come on in!",6,Big Bang Theory,26,6
26234,Raj,1, Sweet!,6,Big Bang Theory,7,1
26235,Leonard,1, I can't believe I shaved my stomach for this.,6,Big Bang Theory,46,9
26238,Howard,1, Who is it?,6,Big Bang Theory,11,3
26240,Howard,1," Hey, Ma. You know, we could see each other if you turn on the computer.",6,Big Bang Theory,72,15
26242,Howard,1, You can't catch a computer virus.,6,Big Bang Theory,34,6
26244,Howard,1," What do you want, Ma?",6,Big Bang Theory,22,5
26246,Howard,1," Okay, here it is. Bernadette and I are starting a life together and",6,Big Bang Theory,68,13
26248,Howard,1, Ma,6,Big Bang Theory,3,1
26250,Howard,1, It's not definite. I'll talk to Bernadette.,6,Big Bang Theory,44,7
26252,Howard,1," Stop it, Ma. I'm sure I can get Bernie to come around.",6,Big Bang Theory,55,12
26254,Howard,1," Okay, okay.",6,Big Bang Theory,12,2
26256,Howard,1," Now, can we please change the subject?",6,Big Bang Theory,39,7
26259,Raj,1," You know, I'm growing to like American football. ",6,Big Bang Theory,50,8
26260,Penny,1," Yeah, it's fun, isn't it?",6,Big Bang Theory,26,5
26261,Raj,1," Well, it's not the balls-to-the-wall action of badminton or cricket, but hey, what is?",6,Big Bang Theory,87,14
26262,Penny,1," All right, who's ready for another beer?",6,Big Bang Theory,41,7
26263,Leonard,1, I'm good.,6,Big Bang Theory,10,2
26264,Raj,1," No, thank you.",6,Big Bang Theory,15,3
26265,Penny,1, Girls.,6,Big Bang Theory,7,1
26266,Raj,1," Oh, I'm having the nicest time. You guys are like family to me. You know that, right?",6,Big Bang Theory,86,17
26267,Leonard,1, That's great. Get out.,6,Big Bang Theory,23,4
26268,Raj,1, What? Why?,6,Big Bang Theory,11,2
26269,Leonard,1, Penny and I have some issues we need to talk about.,6,Big Bang Theory,52,11
26270,Raj,1," Oh pish on your issues. You guys are fine. Yes, you hit some bumps along the way. I mean, Penny, you've always known how this man has felt about you, but you made him grovel for affection.",6,Big Bang Theory,189,37
26271,Penny,1," Okay, hold on",6,Big Bang Theory,14,3
26272,Raj,1," Now, don't blame yourself. He was a groveller from way back. But the point is, the two of you got past it. And, Leonard, you go and propose to this poor girl in the middle of sex? That was some weak tea, dude.",6,Big Bang Theory,210,43
26273,Leonard,1, Some people might say it was romantic.,6,Big Bang Theory,39,7
26274,Raj,1," Yeah, no. But yet, here you two are, still together. And that's even after you and I had our crazy naked night.",6,Big Bang Theory,112,22
26275,Leonard,1, Okay.,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
26276,Penny,1, That's enough.,6,Big Bang Theory,15,2
26277,Raj,1," I'm just saying that after everything you've been through, you get to look into each other's eyes and say â€œI love you.â€ù And that's beautiful.",6,Big Bang Theory,146,25
26278,Leonard,1," Actually, to this day, she's never really said it.",6,Big Bang Theory,51,9
26279,Raj,1," Oh, Penny. That's ridiculous. You know you love him. You, you look him in the eyes and you say it. ",6,Big Bang Theory,100,20
26280,Penny,1, Raj.,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
26281,Raj,1," Oh come on, you know you want to say it. Say it. Say you love him. Say it!",6,Big Bang Theory,75,18
26283,Raj,1, I really thought she would say it.,6,Big Bang Theory,35,7
26285,Amy,1, Have I ever told you you're like a sexy praying mantis? ,6,Big Bang Theory,57,11
26286,Sheldon,1, Every time you drink alcohol.,6,Big Bang Theory,30,5
26287,Amy,1, You know what's wonderful about the praying mantis? They devour their mate.,6,Big Bang Theory,76,12
26288,Sheldon,1, Your point being?,6,Big Bang Theory,18,3
26289,Amy,1, Dessert is served.,6,Big Bang Theory,19,3
26290,Sheldon,1, I just had cobbler.,6,Big Bang Theory,20,4
26291,Amy,1, You know what? I'm done with this.,6,Big Bang Theory,35,7
26292,Sheldon,1, W-Where are you going?,6,Big Bang Theory,23,4
26293,Amy,1, I'm leaving.,6,Big Bang Theory,13,2
26294,Sheldon,1, You can't leave. I need you.,6,Big Bang Theory,29,6
26295,Amy,1, You do?,6,Big Bang Theory,8,2
26296,Sheldon,1, Yes. You're my ride.,6,Big Bang Theory,21,4
26297,Amy,1," Sheldon, you either say something meaningful and from the heart, or you and I are done.",6,Big Bang Theory,88,16
26298,Sheldon,1," All right. Please. Amy, when I look in your eyes and you're looking back in mine, everything feels not quite normal, because I feel stronger and weaker at the same time. I feel excited and, at the same time, terrified. The truth is, I don't know what I feel, except I know what kind of man I want to be.",6,Big Bang Theory,304,60
26299,Amy,1," Sheldon, that was beautiful.",6,Big Bang Theory,29,4
26300,Sheldon,1, I should hope so. That's from the first Spider-Man movie.,6,Big Bang Theory,58,10
26301,Amy,1, I'll take it.,6,Big Bang Theory,14,3
26302,Sheldon,1," Good. Now, I assume we're splitting the cheque?",6,Big Bang Theory,48,8
26304,Raj,1," Hey, Stuart.",6,Big Bang Theory,13,2
26306,Raj,1," Oh, I'm sorry. I'll leave.",6,Big Bang Theory,27,5
26308,Raj,1, You sure?,6,Big Bang Theory,10,2
26310,Raj,1, All right. Great.,6,Big Bang Theory,18,3
26312,Raj,1, What are you drinking?,6,Big Bang Theory,23,4
26314,Raj,1, Perfect for the night I'm having. Thank you.,6,Big Bang Theory,45,8
26316,Raj,1, Amen to that. Sometimes I pour a little chardonnay into my dog's water bowl.,6,Big Bang Theory,77,14
26318,Raj,1," She's kind of a mean drunk, but what are you gonna do?",6,Big Bang Theory,55,12
26320,Raj,1, Cheers.,6,Big Bang Theory,8,1
26322,Raj,1, Sure. Mmm. Bossa nova. You listen to that with your hips as well as your ears.,6,Big Bang Theory,79,16
26324,Raj,1, Oh. Something about latin music just makes me feel like I'm on a white sand beach in Rio.,6,Big Bang Theory,90,18
26326,Raj,1, I should go.,6,Big Bang Theory,13,3
26328,Raj,1," Uh, thank you for the drink.",6,Big Bang Theory,29,6
26330,Raj,1," Hey, Stuart.",6,Big Bang Theory,13,2
26332,Raj,1," Do you want to hang out tomorrow night, maybe grab a bite to eat or catch a late movie?",6,Big Bang Theory,88,19
26334,Raj,1, No problem. My treat. I'll swing by after work.,6,Big Bang Theory,48,9
26336,Raj,1, Okay.,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
26340,Howard,1," Hey, I'm a grown man. I'm gonna live with my wife. My mother's just gonna have to learn to make do on her own.",6,Big Bang Theory,111,24
26342,Howard,1, Who can tell? She yells everything. She might have been upset. She might have been hungry.,6,Big Bang Theory,91,16
26344,Howard,1," I love you, too. Sweet dreams. I'll talk to you tomorrow?",6,Big Bang Theory,58,11
26346,Howard,1," To infinity and beyond, baby.",6,Big Bang Theory,30,5
26348,Howard,1, I know.,6,Big Bang Theory,8,2
26350,Howard,1," Oh, I'm never going back.",6,Big Bang Theory,26,5
26353,Penny,2," Ooh, one gravy boat.",6,Big Bang Theory,21,4
26354,Amy,2, That's from Sheldon. He told me he had it engraved.,6,Big Bang Theory,52,10
26356,Penny,2," One inappropriate, yet I wish I thought of that gravy boat.",6,Big Bang Theory,60,11
26357,Amy,2, When I get married I'm going to register at the UCLA Cadaver Lab.,6,Big Bang Theory,66,13
26358,Penny,2," Ew, why?",6,Big Bang Theory,9,2
26359,Amy,2, â€˜Cause I've always wanted a whole human skeleton and they are really spendy.,6,Big Bang Theory,79,13
26361,Amy,2, Not just someday. In exactly four years. But don't tell Sheldon. He's still a flight risk.,6,Big Bang Theory,91,16
26363,Penny,2, What about me what?,6,Big Bang Theory,20,4
26365,Penny,2," Oh, well, you know, Leonard is great.",6,Big Bang Theory,38,7
26367,Penny,2, He's a sweetie.,6,Big Bang Theory,16,3
26368,Amy,2, You're not answering the question. Do you love him?,6,Big Bang Theory,52,9
26369,Penny,2," Yeah, sure, of course I love him.",6,Big Bang Theory,34,7
26371,Penny,2," Well, I do.",6,Big Bang Theory,12,3
26373,Penny,2," No, he'd just take it the wrong way.",6,Big Bang Theory,37,8
26374,Amy,2, What does that mean?,6,Big Bang Theory,21,4
26375,Penny,2, It means he is special and smart and nice and,6,Big Bang Theory,46,10
26377,Penny,2, No. Maybe. I don't know.,6,Big Bang Theory,25,5
26379,Penny,2," That's the thing, I'm not. I'm not unhappy at all. It's just, I don't know, I, I've been in love before, but it felt different. But maybe this is a new, better, boring kind of love. Do you ever feel that way about Howard?",6,Big Bang Theory,222,44
26381,Penny,2," Amy, you?",6,Big Bang Theory,10,2
26382,Amy,2," Can't help ya, kid. Whenever I'm around Sheldon, I feel like my loins are on fire. In the good way. Not the urinary tract infection way.",6,Big Bang Theory,137,26
26384,Raj,2," Hey, buddy, how's it going up there?",6,Big Bang Theory,37,7
26385,Howard,2," You don't have to shout, Raj. It's not like I'm an astronaut floating around in outer space. Oh, wait, I am.",6,Big Bang Theory,109,21
26386,Leonard,2," So, is it everything you hoped it would be?",6,Big Bang Theory,44,9
26387,Howard,2, It's better. I wake up every morning and I just can't believe I'm on this incredible adventure.,6,Big Bang Theory,96,17
26389,Howard,2, Excuse me. I'm talking to my friends.,6,Big Bang Theory,38,7
26392,Howard,2," Funny. We're always giving each other a hard time up here. It's kind of like being in a frat. You know, joking, kidding around, hurting feelings.",6,Big Bang Theory,146,26
26393,Sheldon,2," Okay, my turn. Let me talk to him.",6,Big Bang Theory,35,8
26394,Leonard,2, Go ahead.,6,Big Bang Theory,10,2
26395,Sheldon,2," 2311 North Los Robles Avenue, Pasadena, California to International Space Station. Can you read me? Over. ",6,Big Bang Theory,107,16
26396,Howard,2," Yes, I read you, Sheldon.",6,Big Bang Theory,26,5
26397,Sheldon,2, Copy that. Over. ,6,Big Bang Theory,18,3
26398,Leonard,2, What are you doing?,6,Big Bang Theory,20,4
26399,Sheldon,2, I am talking to a man in space. If you don't have the  then he might as well be at the Coffee Bean over on Lake Street.,6,Big Bang Theory,120,27
26400,Howard,2," You're out of your mind,Sheldon.",6,Big Bang Theory,33,5
26401,Sheldon,2, That's a negative. My mother had me tested. Over. ,6,Big Bang Theory,51,9
26403,Howard,2," All right, all right. I gotta go. There's a meteor shower.",6,Big Bang Theory,59,11
26405,Howard,2, Bye.,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
26406,Sheldon,2, Over and out. ,6,Big Bang Theory,15,3
26407,Raj,2," Bye, buddy!",6,Big Bang Theory,12,2
26409,Raj,2," Hey, Stuart, come on in.",6,Big Bang Theory,25,5
26410,Sheldon,2, What are you doing here?,6,Big Bang Theory,25,5
26412,Sheldon,2, Excuse me. I didn't authorize this.,6,Big Bang Theory,36,6
26413,Leonard,2," Sheldon, you are not in charge.",6,Big Bang Theory,32,6
26414,Sheldon,2, That's mighty sassy for a man with a roommate performance review around the corner.,6,Big Bang Theory,84,14
26415,Raj,2, What's the big deal? You guys are bringing your girlfriends. I didn't want to sit by myself.,6,Big Bang Theory,93,17
26416,Sheldon,2," The big deal is I was expecting us to be an intimate group of five. Now, we're going to be a faceless mass of six.",6,Big Bang Theory,115,25
26417,Leonard,2," It'll be fine. Just, uh, pretend he's Wolowitz.",6,Big Bang Theory,48,8
26418,Sheldon,2, Hmm. Do you like Raisinets?,6,Big Bang Theory,28,5
26420,Sheldon,2," At the movies, Wolowitz always eats Raisinets.",6,Big Bang Theory,47,7
26422,Sheldon,2," Well, it's hardly my business what you eat, as long as it doesn't crunch during the film and it's Raisinets.",6,Big Bang Theory,109,20
26424,Sheldon,2," Yuh-uh, one more question, if you're going to replace Wolowitz, I need to know a little more about you.",6,Big Bang Theory,104,19
26426,Sheldon,2, Wolowitz went to MIT. What's your educational background?,6,Big Bang Theory,58,8
26428,Sheldon,2, Equally ridiculous. Let's go.,6,Big Bang Theory,30,4
26430,Sheldon,2, This insistence on hand-holding is preposterous.,6,Big Bang Theory,49,6
26431,Amy,2," Well, I like it.",6,Big Bang Theory,17,4
26432,Sheldon,2," Yeah, of course you do. You're a girl. You like all kinds of hippy-dippy things.",6,Big Bang Theory,81,15
26433,Amy,2, Just watch the movie.,6,Big Bang Theory,22,4
26434,Sheldon,2, It's not fair. Penny isn't making Leonard hold hands.,6,Big Bang Theory,54,9
26435,Amy,2, There might be a reason for that.,6,Big Bang Theory,34,7
26436,Sheldon,2, Sweaty? Unhygienic? Looks dumb? Take your pick.,6,Big Bang Theory,48,7
26437,Amy,2, Penny said she's not sure she wants to be Leonard's girlfriend anymore.,6,Big Bang Theory,72,12
26438,Sheldon,2, Wrong. She just took a sip from his Diet Dr. Pepper.,6,Big Bang Theory,53,11
26439,Amy,2, So?,6,Big Bang Theory,4,1
26440,Sheldon,2," So, if she wants to end her pair-bond with Leonard, why on earth would she guzzle a witches' brew of his soda and spit?",6,Big Bang Theory,120,24
26441,Amy,2, It's complicated.,6,Big Bang Theory,18,2
26442,Sheldon,2," String theory is complicated. That's just yucky. Don't get any ideas. All right, for the sake of argument, let's say that's true. Why doesn't Penny just end the relationship?",6,Big Bang Theory,175,29
26443,Amy,2, She's not sure how she feels.,6,Big Bang Theory,30,6
26444,Sheldon,2," How can she not be sure how she feels? You know, when I have a feeling, I know it. Trains? Love them. Swordfish? I love them, too. They're fish with a sword for a nose.",6,Big Bang Theory,169,35
26445,Amy,2," Regardless, don't say anything to Leonard.",6,Big Bang Theory,43,6
26446,Sheldon,2," Now you're asking me to keep a secret from my best friend, colleague, and roommate?",6,Big Bang Theory,84,15
26447,Amy,2," Yes, please, Penny will kill me.",6,Big Bang Theory,33,6
26448,Sheldon,2," Uh, fine. FYI, secret-keeping? Hate it. Hand-holding? Not a fan. Hammerhead shark? I love that thing. Yeah, it's another fish with a tool on its head.",6,Big Bang Theory,151,26
26450,Sheldon,2," Shh, we're trying to watch the movie. This is not working out with him.",6,Big Bang Theory,72,14
26452,Leonard,2, What are you doing?,6,Big Bang Theory,20,4
26453,Sheldon,2, I think I might have tartar buildup. My tongue won't go as far forward as it used to.,6,Big Bang Theory,86,18
26454,Leonard,2, Maybe your tongue is shrinking.,6,Big Bang Theory,32,5
26455,Sheldon,2," Nope. Oh, you have no idea how annoying this is.",6,Big Bang Theory,49,10
26456,Leonard,2, I'm starting to get a sense of it. Don't worry. I'll take you to the dentist tomorrow.,6,Big Bang Theory,87,17
26457,Sheldon,2," Thank you. I appreciate that. You're good people, Leonard. There's something I need to tell you.",6,Big Bang Theory,97,16
26458,Leonard,2, Okay.,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
26459,Sheldon,2, I can't tell you.,6,Big Bang Theory,18,4
26460,Leonard,2, Why?,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
26461,Sheldon,2, I can't tell you why I can't tell you. So I guess there's two things I can't tell you.,6,Big Bang Theory,87,19
26462,Leonard,2, I wish there were more.,6,Big Bang Theory,24,5
26463,Sheldon,2, Good night. I'm sorry. This is really important.,6,Big Bang Theory,49,8
26464,Leonard,2, What is it?,6,Big Bang Theory,12,3
26465,Sheldon,2, I like The Transformers. Do you like The Transformers?,6,Big Bang Theory,55,9
26466,Leonard,2, Where exactly did your mother have you tested?,6,Big Bang Theory,47,8
26467,Sheldon,2," Leonard, the Transformers teach us that things are not always what they appear to be. You know, like, uh, a semi truck might be an alien robot, or, uh, someone in a romantic relationship, uh, might feel differently than they appear to. Or a conversation about The Transformers might actually be about someone in this room. I'm going to pause to let that sink in.",6,Big Bang Theory,363,65
26468,Leonard,2," Okay, I think I understand.",6,Big Bang Theory,28,5
26469,Sheldon,2, You do?,6,Big Bang Theory,8,2
26470,Leonard,2," The guy who seems like an emotionless robot is you, but your relationship with Amy is causing you to transform into a red-blooded man with sexual desires.",6,Big Bang Theory,155,27
26471,Sheldon,2, That is literally the stupidest thing I've ever heard.,6,Big Bang Theory,55,9
26473,Sheldon,2,  Leonard?  Leonard?  Leonard?,6,Big Bang Theory,30,3
26474,Leonard,2, What?,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
26475,Sheldon,2, Are you sleeping?,6,Big Bang Theory,18,3
26476,Leonard,2, I was. Now I'm having a nightmare. What do you want?,6,Big Bang Theory,53,11
26477,Sheldon,2, Never mind. I still can't tell you.,6,Big Bang Theory,36,7
26479,Sheldon,2,  Penny?  Penny?  Penny? ,6,Big Bang Theory,25,3
26480,Penny,2," Oh, my God. Sheldon?",6,Big Bang Theory,21,4
26481,Sheldon,2, You frightened me.,6,Big Bang Theory,19,3
26482,Penny,2, What are you doing in my bedroom?,6,Big Bang Theory,34,7
26483,Sheldon,2," Yeah, well, I knocked on the front door, but you didn't hear it.",6,Big Bang Theory,65,13
26484,Penny,2," How did you even get in, you weirdo?",6,Big Bang Theory,37,8
26485,Sheldon,2," Yeah, really? I've seen strange men traipsing in and out of here for years, but when I do it, it's weird?",6,Big Bang Theory,106,21
26486,Penny,2," What do you want, Sheldon?",6,Big Bang Theory,27,5
26487,Sheldon,2," Oh, I was having a little trouble sleeping and I just thought, uh, seeing as you're up, we could talk.",6,Big Bang Theory,103,20
26488,Penny,2, Talk about what?,6,Big Bang Theory,17,3
26489,Sheldon,2," Oh, I don't know, uh, weather, uh, fish you could do carpentry with, why Leonard is such an attractive and desirable boyfriend. Yeah, pick one, your choice.",6,Big Bang Theory,157,27
26490,Penny,2, Sheldon.,6,Big Bang Theory,9,1
26491,Sheldon,2, Did you know that Leonard has a perfect driving record and enjoys the insurance discounts that go along with that? Hubba-hubba.,6,Big Bang Theory,128,21
26492,Penny,2," Okay, go home, crazy man.",6,Big Bang Theory,26,5
26493,Sheldon,2," Yeah. Did you know that while Leonard is not considered a tall fellow in our country, in today's North Korea, he's downright average. Hey, talk about a keeper.",6,Big Bang Theory,160,28
26494,Penny,2," Okay, what did Amy tell you?",6,Big Bang Theory,29,6
26495,Sheldon,2," Oh, very well. I can't keep up this clever charade any longer. She told me that you were thinking of ending it with Leonard.",6,Big Bang Theory,125,24
26496,Penny,2," Okay, you listen to me. I think it's really sweet you're trying to protect your friend, but this is none of your business. Got it?",6,Big Bang Theory,131,25
26497,Sheldon,2, Excuse me. This is not about protecting my friend. I'm a big fan of homeostasis. Do you know what that is?,6,Big Bang Theory,107,21
26498,Penny,2, Of course not.,6,Big Bang Theory,15,3
26499,Sheldon,2, Homeostasis refers to a system's ability to regulate its internal environment and maintain a constant condition of properties like temperature or pH.,6,Big Bang Theory,150,22
26500,Penny,2, Worst bedtime story ever.,6,Big Bang Theory,26,4
26501,Sheldon,2," My point is I don't like when things change. So, regardless of your feelings, I would like you to continue dating Leonard. And also, while we're on the subject, you recently changed your shampoo. I'm not comfortable with the new scent. Please stop this madness and go back to green apple.",6,Big Bang Theory,289,51
26502,Penny,2," Okay, honey, I have a lot to figure out, and until I do, you are not to say a word to Leonard. Do you understand?",6,Big Bang Theory,114,25
26503,Sheldon,2, I do. You clear on the shampoo issue?,6,Big Bang Theory,38,8
26504,Penny,2, Get out.,6,Big Bang Theory,9,2
26505,Sheldon,2, Penny?,6,Big Bang Theory,7,1
26506,Penny,2, What?,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
26507,Sheldon,2, Please don't hurt my friend.,6,Big Bang Theory,29,5
26508,Penny,2, That is the last thing I want to do.,6,Big Bang Theory,37,9
26509,Sheldon,2, Thank you. Coconut? What were you thinking? Are you a hula girl?,6,Big Bang Theory,65,12
26510,Penny,2, Get out.,6,Big Bang Theory,9,2
26512,Amy,2, Hello?,6,Big Bang Theory,7,1
26513,Penny,2, What the hell is wrong with you? You told Sheldon? Do you know what a terrible position this puts me in? ,6,Big Bang Theory,106,21
26514,Amy,2," Hang on, please. Hello?",6,Big Bang Theory,24,4
26515,Amy,2, I know. She's yelling at me right now.,6,Big Bang Theory,39,8
26516,Sheldon,2," All right then, so we're all on the same page. Yes.",6,Big Bang Theory,52,11
26518,Howard,2," Hey, Bernie.",6,Big Bang Theory,13,2
26520,Howard,2," Oh, it's okay. Space is beautiful. Earth is beautiful. Same old, same old.",6,Big Bang Theory,75,13
26522,Howard,2, Nothing. Everything's fine.,6,Big Bang Theory,28,3
26524,Howard,2, The other astronauts are being mean to me.,6,Big Bang Theory,43,8
26526,Howard,2," Well, like for instance, the other day when I was asleep, one of the guys went on a space walk and glued a big-eyed rubber alien mask to the outside of my window. When I woke up, I screamed for like nine minutes.",6,Big Bang Theory,213,43
26528,Howard,2, You can see it if you want. It's on YouTube. Google astronaut screams for nine minutes.,6,Big Bang Theory,88,16
26530,Howard,2, What am I supposed to say?,6,Big Bang Theory,27,6
26532,Howard,2," Great, I'll do that when I want to be the first guy in space to get a wedgie.",6,Big Bang Theory,78,18
26534,Howard,2, No. My mom already tried that. It only made things worse.,6,Big Bang Theory,58,11
26536,Leonard,2, Gelatinous Sphere.,6,Big Bang Theory,19,2
26537,Raj,2, Focused Locust.,6,Big Bang Theory,16,2
26539,Sheldon,2, I'm sorry. Wolowitz would never play that card.,6,Big Bang Theory,48,8
26541,Sheldon,2," Fairy God Monster, I win. Your desperate need for friendship makes you weak.",6,Big Bang Theory,77,13
26542,Raj,2," So, what are you guys doing later? Stuart and I were thinking of going out for a drink.",6,Big Bang Theory,88,18
26544,Raj,2, â€˜Cause that's what we do.,6,Big Bang Theory,28,5
26546,Raj,2," In case you didn't follow that, I'm the coffee.",6,Big Bang Theory,48,9
26547,Sheldon,2, Leonard? Maybe you'd like to go with them to meet girls.,6,Big Bang Theory,57,11
26548,Leonard,2, Why would I be interested? I have Penny.,6,Big Bang Theory,41,8
26549,Sheldon,2," Yeah, for now. But that woman has a death wish, Leonard. She talks to strangers, she pets unfamiliar dogs, and it is ridiculously easy to break into her apartment. If I were you, I'd get a back-up.",6,Big Bang Theory,198,37
26550,Leonard,2, You can't just replace someone you care about with some other random person.,6,Big Bang Theory,77,13
26552,Sheldon,2, Do you remember how upset I was when they replaced Edward Norton as the Hulk?,6,Big Bang Theory,78,15
26553,Leonard,2," Yes, you walked around for a week saying, Sheldon unhappy with casting choice.",6,Big Bang Theory,79,13
26554,Sheldon,2," But, then Mark Ruffalo was the Hulk in The Avengers, and he was even better.",6,Big Bang Theory,77,15
26555,Leonard,2, What's your point?,6,Big Bang Theory,19,3
26556,Sheldon,2, Call me a romantic. I like to think that your Mark Ruffalo is still out there somewhere.,6,Big Bang Theory,89,17
26557,Leonard,2, This is ridiculous. Are we gonna play cards or not?,6,Big Bang Theory,52,10
26559,Sheldon,2," Yeah, settle down there, fake Wolowitz. No one likes a kiss-up.",6,Big Bang Theory,64,11
26561,Leonard,2," So, I had to take Sheldon to the dentist this morning.",6,Big Bang Theory,55,11
26562,Penny,2, Really?,6,Big Bang Theory,8,1
26563,Leonard,2," Yup. I told him if he didn't bite the hygienist, I'd take him for ice cream.",6,Big Bang Theory,77,16
26564,Penny,2, Mmm.,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
26565,Leonard,2, I didn't have to take him for ice cream.,6,Big Bang Theory,41,9
26566,Penny,2, Uh-huh.,6,Big Bang Theory,8,1
26567,Leonard,2, You okay? You seem a little distracted.,6,Big Bang Theory,40,7
26568,Penny,2," Look, there's something I need to tell you.",6,Big Bang Theory,44,8
26569,Leonard,2," Oh. Yeah, okay.",6,Big Bang Theory,16,3
26570,Penny,2, I don't really know how to say this.,6,Big Bang Theory,37,8
26571,Leonard,2, Just say it.,6,Big Bang Theory,13,3
26572,Penny,2, Okay. Here goes.,6,Big Bang Theory,17,3
26573,Leonard,2, Mm-hmm.,6,Big Bang Theory,8,1
26575,Amy,2, You slept with him?,6,Big Bang Theory,20,4
26576,Penny,2," I didn't know what else to do. He had those big, sad eyes.",6,Big Bang Theory,59,13
26578,Penny,2, He looked at me like this.,6,Big Bang Theory,27,6
26579,Amy,2," Well, if that's all it takes, it's a good thing you don't have a dog.",6,Big Bang Theory,70,15
26581,Penny,2," Look, it's fine. We're not getting married, okay? We're keeping things, you know, homeostasis.",6,Big Bang Theory,95,14
26582,Amy,2, It's so cute when she tries.,6,Big Bang Theory,29,6
26583,Penny,2," It's from Leonard. Last night was amazing. You're amazing. I'm so lucky to have you in my life.  Okay, stop it.",6,Big Bang Theory,112,21
26585,Howard,2," Hey, Bernie, guess what? I stood up to the other astronauts like you said and I got to tell you, last night was the first time in a week I got a good night's sleep. ",6,Big Bang Theory,166,35
26587,Howard,2, What's wrong? You look upset.,6,Big Bang Theory,30,5
26590,Howard,3," Hey, Bernie.",6,Big Bang Theory,13,2
26592,Howard,3," Okay, I guess. It's just, being cooped up in this tin can for weeks on end is starting to get to me.",6,Big Bang Theory,101,22
26594,Howard,3, I know.,6,Big Bang Theory,8,2
26596,Howard,3," Love you too. Hey, Bernie? Before you go, can you do something for me?",6,Big Bang Theory,71,14
26598,Howard,3," Okay, here it is. I really miss gravity. Can you drop something so I can watch it fall?",6,Big Bang Theory,88,18
26600,Howard,3," Oh, baby, you're killing me.",6,Big Bang Theory,29,5
26602,Penny,3," Ugh. Hey, Sheldon? Hi. This came for you today. It's from your mom.",6,Big Bang Theory,68,13
26603,Sheldon,3," Oh, thank you, Penny.",6,Big Bang Theory,22,4
26604,Penny,3, M-hmm.,6,Big Bang Theory,7,1
26605,Sheldon,3," Yeah, wait, here. For your troubles.",6,Big Bang Theory,37,6
26606,Penny,3," Oh, boy, a whole dollar. Now, I can quit my paper route. So, what's in it?",6,Big Bang Theory,75,16
26607,Leonard,3," Mmm, doesn't matter. Half the time, he just ends up playing with the box.",6,Big Bang Theory,74,14
26608,Sheldon,3," Yeah, it's journals and research papers I wrote as a child.",6,Big Bang Theory,60,11
26609,Penny,3," Aw, how cute. Is this like a diary?",6,Big Bang Theory,36,8
26610,Sheldon,3," No, that's my potty training journal.",6,Big Bang Theory,38,6
26611,Penny,3," Really, your potty training journal?",6,Big Bang Theory,37,5
26612,Sheldon,3, Yeah. And forgive my crude penmanship. I didn't start typing until I was six.,6,Big Bang Theory,78,14
26613,Sheldon,3," There are some charts in the back where I kept track of shape, colour and consistency.",6,Big Bang Theory,87,16
26614,Penny,3," Oh, disgusting.",6,Big Bang Theory,16,2
26615,Leonard,3," No, what's disgusting is he's still keeping track.",6,Big Bang Theory,51,8
26616,Penny,3, Why do you need all this stuff?,6,Big Bang Theory,32,7
26617,Leonard,3," No, no, no, no.",6,Big Bang Theory,16,4
26618,Penny,3, Sorry!,6,Big Bang Theory,7,1
26619,Sheldon,3, I am glad you asked. Are you familiar with the Higgs boson?,6,Big Bang Theory,60,12
26620,Penny,3," Of course, it is, it's been in the news. And it's a very famous boson.",6,Big Bang Theory,71,15
26621,Sheldon,3," Nice try. Now, in 1964, Dr. Peter Higgs, accomplished self-promoter and physicist, he wrote a paper postulating the existence of a subatomic particle called the Higgs boson. Now, initially the paper was rejected, but recently, he was proven right, and now he's on the fast track to win a Nobel prize.",6,Big Bang Theory,301,51
26622,Penny,3," Yeah, that's basically what I said.",6,Big Bang Theory,36,6
26623,Sheldon,3," Yeah, the point is Higgs is being celebrated for work he did 50 years ago, so that got me thinking, perhaps I've already hit upon the idea that will win me my Nobel prize.",6,Big Bang Theory,172,34
26624,Leonard,3, I didn't know they gave Nobel prizes for making boom-boom in the potty.,6,Big Bang Theory,72,13
26625,Penny,3, You really think there's some kind of scientific discovery in here?,6,Big Bang Theory,68,11
26626,Sheldon,3," Well, this box only covers my work through nursery school. There's a good deal more to come. I didn't really hit my academic stride until I cut out that time-suck known as playing outdoors.",6,Big Bang Theory,190,34
26627,Leonard,3," So, you're going to spend hours and hours combing through all this stuff?",6,Big Bang Theory,74,13
26628,Sheldon,3," That's a good point. My time is much too valuable. You know, perhaps I should find someone to do it for me. You know, someone with a rudimentary understanding of science, but whose real talents lie in menial labour.",6,Big Bang Theory,216,39
26629,Leonard,3, Not gonna happen.,6,Big Bang Theory,18,3
26630,Sheldon,3," Well, if I didn't think you could handle it, I wouldn't be asking.",6,Big Bang Theory,67,13
26631,Leonard,3," If you want help, just hire a grad student.",6,Big Bang Theory,44,9
26632,Penny,3, Maybe I could do it.,6,Big Bang Theory,21,5
26633,Sheldon,3," You, really? You can assess the quality of my work? Okay, um, here. I wrote this when I was five years old.",6,Big Bang Theory,108,22
26634,Penny,3," A proof that algebraic topology can never have a non self-contradictory set of abelion groups. I'm just a blonde monkey to you, aren't I?",6,Big Bang Theory,138,24
26635,Sheldon,3," You said it, not me.",6,Big Bang Theory,21,5
26637,Sheldon,3," All right, Ms. Jenson. Uh, before we begin, may I offer you a refreshment? Water, coffee, tea, a marijuana cigarette?",6,Big Bang Theory,118,20
26639,Sheldon,3," Now, are you sure? Everyone's smoking them. I think they're the best.",6,Big Bang Theory,70,12
26641,Sheldon,3," Excellent, yeah. That was a ruse. They're not the best. Physics is the best. And by the way, coffee was also an unacceptable choice. All right, so I see here you're from Des Moines, Iowa. Uh, you're summa cum laude in theoretical physics from Stanford University. Oh, and two years ago, you had a persistent ear infection. I hope that didn't cause any hearing loss.",6,Big Bang Theory,366,65
26643,Sheldon,3," I did a comprehensive background check. Medical records, credit reports, criminal history.   I trust you paid off those parking tickets.",6,Big Bang Theory,137,20
26645,Sheldon,3," Hearing unimpaired, good.",6,Big Bang Theory,26,3
26647,Sheldon,3," Flattery will not get you this job, Ms. Jenson.",6,Big Bang Theory,48,9
26649,Sheldon,3," Oh, well, thank you. Welcome aboard.",6,Big Bang Theory,37,6
26651,Leonard,3, You talk to Howard lately?,6,Big Bang Theory,27,5
26652,Raj,3," Uh, yeah, last night. He kept making me drop pencils for him. I got uncomfortable.   Hey, Sheldon, hope you're hungry, they're serving macaroni and   che-ee-ee-ese.",6,Big Bang Theory,165,25
26653,Leonard,3, Smooth. Hi.,6,Big Bang Theory,12,2
26655,Leonard,3," Sheldon, aren't you going to introduce us?",6,Big Bang Theory,43,7
26656,Sheldon,3, No. I have people for that now. You're up.,6,Big Bang Theory,43,9
26658,Leonard,3," Ah, congratulations and may God have mercy on your soul. I'm Leonard. This is Raj.",6,Big Bang Theory,83,15
26660,Sheldon,3," Yeah, please reserve chitchat for your breaks, Ms. Jenson. FYI, there will be no breaks.",6,Big Bang Theory,89,15
26662,Leonard,3, She seems nice.,6,Big Bang Theory,16,3
26663,Raj,3," Hey, you already got a girlfriend. I call dibs.",6,Big Bang Theory,48,9
26664,Leonard,3, All I said was she seems nice.,6,Big Bang Theory,31,7
26665,Raj,3," Yeah, well, I love her.",6,Big Bang Theory,24,5
26668,Howard,3," Uh, no, not really.",6,Big Bang Theory,20,4
26670,Howard,3," Well, remember the Soyuz capsule they were sending to bring us home?",6,Big Bang Theory,69,12
26672,Howard,3," It's delayed. We're gonna be here at least another week. Maybe ten days. It's the Russians, so you don't know. They left dogs up here in the sixties.",6,Big Bang Theory,150,28
26674,Howard,3," I don't know how much longer I can take this. I can't sleep, and zero gravity is giving me crazy acid reflux. I'm down to my last three Tums.",6,Big Bang Theory,142,29
26676,Howard,3," Okay, okay. What am I doing? I'm using up all the oxygen. If I die, promise you'll never have sex with another man.",6,Big Bang Theory,116,23
26678,Amy,3," Oh, yeah. I'm a man-eater now.",6,Big Bang Theory,31,6
26679,Penny,3," Okay, for the final touch, this is an eyelash curler. You just place it on your lashes and squeeze it closed.",6,Big Bang Theory,110,21
26680,Amy,3," Oh, I don't know. Looks like something used by Tinkerbell's gynecologist.",6,Big Bang Theory,74,11
26681,Penny,3," Who I hope for her sake is not Captain Hook, so who are you calling?",6,Big Bang Theory,69,15
26682,Amy,3," I'm going to video-chat Sheldon. If my new look leads to phone sex, I'm going to have to ask you to leave the room.",6,Big Bang Theory,116,24
26684,Amy,3," Oh, hello. Who are you?",6,Big Bang Theory,24,5
26686,Amy,3, I'd like to speak to Sheldon.,6,Big Bang Theory,30,6
26688,Amy,3," All right. Well, tell him Amy called.",6,Big Bang Theory,38,7
26690,Amy,3, He knows my last name. I'm his girlfriend. We have a contract and everything. I'll send you a PDF.,6,Big Bang Theory,99,19
26692,Amy,3," Hmm, that's weird.",6,Big Bang Theory,19,3
26693,Penny,3, What?,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
26694,Amy,3, Sheldon told me he had a new assistant named Alex. He didn't mention that Alex was a girl.,6,Big Bang Theory,91,18
26695,Penny,3, Maybe he didn't notice.,6,Big Bang Theory,24,4
26696,Amy,3, You're right. I don't have to worry about Sheldon.,6,Big Bang Theory,51,9
26697,Penny,3," No, you do not.",6,Big Bang Theory,16,4
26698,Amy,3, It's her I have to worry about.,6,Big Bang Theory,32,7
26699,Penny,3," Oh, Amy, really? She is not going to come on to Sheldon.",6,Big Bang Theory,57,12
26700,Amy,3," Oh, really? Look at this face  How can any woman spend eight hours a day alone with this face and not fall in love with it?",6,Big Bang Theory,124,26
26701,Penny,3," Well, for starters, at some point, that face starts talking.",6,Big Bang Theory,61,10
26703,Penny,3," Amy, this is crazy. You have nothing to be suspicious about.",6,Big Bang Theory,61,11
26704,Amy,3," I'm not suspicious. I just want to stop in, say hi to my boyfriend and meet his new assistant.  Aha!",6,Big Bang Theory,101,20
26705,Penny,3, Can we go now?,6,Big Bang Theory,15,4
26706,Amy,3, Hang on. ,6,Big Bang Theory,10,2
26707,Penny,3, What are you doing?,6,Big Bang Theory,20,4
26708,Amy,3, Isn't it obvious? I'm spreading my scent to mark my territory.,6,Big Bang Theory,63,11
26709,Penny,3," Come on, Amy. That is not gonna work.",6,Big Bang Theory,38,8
26710,Amy,3," Really? Because just before you became my best friend, I did this all over your apartment.",6,Big Bang Theory,91,16
26712,Raj,3," Has your, uh, assistant said anything about me?",6,Big Bang Theory,48,8
26713,Sheldon,3," Oh, in fact, she has. Uh, her exact words were, what is that guy's problem?",6,Big Bang Theory,76,15
26714,Raj,3, I'm in her head. Let the dance begin.,6,Big Bang Theory,38,8
26716,Leonard,3, This should be fun.,6,Big Bang Theory,20,4
26717,Sheldon,3," Half chocolate, half vanilla, side by side, not swirled?",6,Big Bang Theory,57,9
26719,Sheldon,3, Half a teaspoon of sprinkles?,6,Big Bang Theory,30,5
26721,Sheldon,3, Two cherries?,6,Big Bang Theory,14,2
26723,Sheldon,3, Stems removed?,6,Big Bang Theory,15,2
26725,Leonard,3, Oh!,6,Big Bang Theory,4,1
26727,Sheldon,3," It's all right, Alex. I'm not mad at you, I'm just disappointed.",6,Big Bang Theory,65,12
26728,Leonard,3," Wait, Alex. Do you want to join us?",6,Big Bang Theory,36,8
26730,Sheldon,3," Uh, Alex, a moment. I need a word with Dr. Hofstadter. Do you think it's appropriate for her to sit with us, given her station?",6,Big Bang Theory,128,25
26731,Leonard,3, Given her what?,6,Big Bang Theory,16,3
26732,Sheldon,3," If I've learned anything from British television shows on PBS, it's that servants dine downstairs with their own kind.",6,Big Bang Theory,119,19
26733,Leonard,3, What?,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
26734,Sheldon,3," It's a kindness, Leonard. Otherwise, you're cruelly tempting them with a glimpse of a world that's just beyond their soot-stained fingertips.",6,Big Bang Theory,142,21
26735,Leonard,3," Oh, sure. Please join us.",6,Big Bang Theory,26,5
26737,Leonard,3," So, Alex, what's the topic of your dissertation?",6,Big Bang Theory,49,8
26739,Leonard,3," Oh, that happens to be Dr. Koothrappali's field of expertise. You two have a lot to talk about.",6,Big Bang Theory,96,18
26741,Leonard,3," No. But compared to your boss, he's the poster boy for sanity.",6,Big Bang Theory,63,12
26743,Leonard,3," Oh, SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. You should introduce him to Sheldon. The search is over.",6,Big Bang Theory,113,17
26745,Leonard,3, High-energy lasers.,6,Big Bang Theory,20,2
26747,Leonard,3," Not yet, but I can remove unwanted hair from two miles away.",6,Big Bang Theory,61,12
26748,Amy,3," You were right. I had nothing to worry about. That skank's your problem, not mine.",6,Big Bang Theory,83,15
26750,Leonard,3, Thank you.,6,Big Bang Theory,11,2
26751,Sheldon,3, Cherry stem! Cherry stem!,6,Big Bang Theory,26,4
26754,Howard,3," Oh, a lot better, thanks. One sec. Listen close, I don't have a lot of time. I need you to go to my house. In my bedroom, you'll find a model rocket. I want you to take it and bring it back to your place.",6,Big Bang Theory,205,45
26756,Howard,3," Step two, build a version roughly fourteen stories high. Fill it full of rocket fuel and come get me. I'll leave the door unlocked.",6,Big Bang Theory,132,24
26758,Howard,3," No, no, I'm fine. No anxiety. We should probably talk in code. From now on, frog is me, sandwich means you and lemon means rocket. So, come on, sandwich, build me a lemon 'cause froggy wants to come home.",6,Big Bang Theory,205,39
26760,Amy,3," Look at you, putting on a brave face.",6,Big Bang Theory,38,8
26761,Penny,3, There's nothing to be brave about. Everything's fine.,6,Big Bang Theory,54,8
26762,Amy,3," Really? I don't know how much you know about primate behaviour, but Sheldon's assistant was clearly courting Leonard. Were she a mandrill, she would have bent over and displayed her brightly coloured hindquarters like a big red welcome mat. By the way, you try that at the junior prom, you get kicked out.",6,Big Bang Theory,306,53
26763,Penny,3," Okay, maybe she was flirting with him, but who cares? Look, I don't even know where my relationship is with Leonard is right now.",6,Big Bang Theory,130,24
26764,Amy,3," So says your prefrontal cortex. But meanwhile, the limbic system of your brain is calculating that if another woman is attracted to Leonard, it must be because he's desirable.",6,Big Bang Theory,176,29
26765,Penny,3," Well, of course he's desirable. I mean, he's great. He's smart, he's sweet, and, ooh, in the bedroom, whew, let me tell you, he really tries.",6,Big Bang Theory,142,26
26766,Amy,3, So it does bother you.,6,Big Bang Theory,23,5
26767,Penny,3," Fine, it bothers me a little. No. You know what? This is stupid. It doesn't bother me. Okay, it bothers me. But only because she wouldn't stop laughing. Leonard is not that funny.",6,Big Bang Theory,180,33
26768,Amy,3," And there you have it, prefrontal cortex reasoning versus limbic lust. If this were a boxing match, they might call it the thrilla adjacent to the amygdala. If you were a brain scientist, you would be busting a gut right now.",6,Big Bang Theory,226,41
26770,Penny,3," So, how was work today?",6,Big Bang Theory,24,5
26771,Leonard,3," Ah, it was all right, I guess. Got to Heimlich a cherry stem out of Sheldon. Caught Raj right in the eye.",6,Big Bang Theory,106,22
26772,Penny,3, Oh! You're kidding.,6,Big Bang Theory,20,3
26773,Leonard,3," No, Raj had to go to the nurse.",6,Big Bang Theory,32,8
26774,Penny,3, Wow. Anything else?,6,Big Bang Theory,20,3
26775,Leonard,3," Mmm, the nurse is a woman, so he couldn't talk to her. She had to bring him a Grover puppet so he could point at what hurt.",6,Big Bang Theory,124,27
26776,Penny,3," Oh, is that it?",6,Big Bang Theory,16,4
26777,Leonard,3, Isn't that enough? It had the weaponised fruit and a puppet. What more do you want?,6,Big Bang Theory,84,16
26778,Sheldon,3," Oh, good, Leonard, you're here. Science news. This will interest you. And, Penny, feel free to paint your nails.",6,Big Bang Theory,113,19
26779,Leonard,3, What do you got?,6,Big Bang Theory,17,4
26780,Sheldon,3, I believe Alex may have unearthed the grade school science project that could be my ticket to the Nobel Prize. Behold.,6,Big Bang Theory,119,21
26781,Sheldon,3, The original title was â€œA Rederivation of Maxwell's Equations Regarding Electromagnetismâ€ùâ€ù I dumbed it down because some of the more religious people in town were starting to say I was a witch.,6,Big Bang Theory,200,32
26783,Penny,3," Oh, it's about time. I hated the old way. Hi. I'm Penny.",6,Big Bang Theory,57,12
26785,Penny,3, In a way. We've kind of been involved in a five-year experiment.,6,Big Bang Theory,65,12
26787,Penny,3," Well, a lot of people can't. Uh, hey.",6,Big Bang Theory,38,8
26788,Leonard,3, Where are we going?,6,Big Bang Theory,20,4
26789,Penny,3, My limbic system wants to take your pants off.,6,Big Bang Theory,47,9
26791,Sheldon,3, Notice people on your own time. We're working.,6,Big Bang Theory,47,8
26794,Howard,3," Better. Much better. The other astronauts held me down, gave me a shot. Oooh. Attention, people of Earth. Tonight, there will be two moons in the sky.",6,Big Bang Theory,151,27
26796,Howard,3, Whee! Whee!,6,Big Bang Theory,12,2
26798,Raj,4, Howard's capsule should be re-entering the atmosphere any minute.,6,Big Bang Theory,66,9
26799,Leonard,4, It'll be good to have him back.,6,Big Bang Theory,32,7
26800,Raj,4, The Fantastic Four reunited.,6,Big Bang Theory,29,4
26801,Sheldon,4," Yeah, you had a good run, Fake Wolowitz. We'll remember you with nostalgic fondness, the way we do the dial-up modem, the VHS tape, or, or Leonard's gym membership.",6,Big Bang Theory,165,29
26802,Raj,4, We're not kicking him out. Stuart and I have become good friends.,6,Big Bang Theory,66,12
26803,Sheldon,4," Okay, one vote for, one vote against. Leonard, you're the tiebreaker.",6,Big Bang Theory,70,11
26804,Leonard,4," I don't have a problem with Stuart. Besides, he gives us a twenty percent discount at his comic book store.",6,Big Bang Theory,108,20
26805,Sheldon,4," Well, I don't sell my friendship that cheaply.",6,Big Bang Theory,47,8
26807,Sheldon,4," Welcome aboard, old chum.",6,Big Bang Theory,26,4
26808,Raj,4," Okay, the NASA Web site says Howard's final descent has begun.",6,Big Bang Theory,63,11
26809,Sheldon,4," He left a boy, he returns a boy-sized hero.",6,Big Bang Theory,44,9
26812,Howard,4," Baruch atah, Adonai, Eloheinu. Melech haolam, hamotzi. Lechem min haaretz",6,Big Bang Theory,74,10
26814,Howard,4, The Jewish prayer for eating bread! We don't have one for falling out of space! We did it! We're on the ground! We survived!,6,Big Bang Theory,125,24
26823,Howard,4," Whoa, thank you. Great to be back on Earth.",6,Big Bang Theory,44,9
26828,Howard,4," I missed you, too. Where are the guys?",6,Big Bang Theory,39,8
26830,Howard,4," Oh, I get it. They're waiting back home with a big surprise party. Don't worry, I can act surprised. ",6,Big Bang Theory,102,19
26832,Howard,4, Gesundheit. You okay?,6,Big Bang Theory,22,3
26834,Howard,4," Great. Just keep in mind astronauts lose a lot of muscle tone in space, so you might have to do most of the heavy lifting.",6,Big Bang Theory,123,25
26836,Sheldon,4," You know, I am very disappointed that I won't be able to celebrate Howard's accomplishment tonight.",6,Big Bang Theory,100,16
26837,Amy,4," Me, too. But we'll see him tomorrow.",6,Big Bang Theory,37,7
26838,Sheldon,4," Yes, it's just that in all the years I've known him, he's never had the opportunity to receive my admiration. I was excited to see the look on his face when it finally happened.",6,Big Bang Theory,178,34
26839,Penny,4, You're unbelievable.,6,Big Bang Theory,21,2
26840,Sheldon,4, I know.,6,Big Bang Theory,8,2
26841,Leonard,4," All right, Pictionary. What are the teams?",6,Big Bang Theory,43,7
26842,Penny,4, How about boys versus girls?,6,Big Bang Theory,29,5
26843,Sheldon,4," Oh, that hardly seems fair. But I guess any team that I'm not on has a decided disadvantage.",6,Big Bang Theory,93,18
26844,Penny,4," Once again, unbelievable.",6,Big Bang Theory,26,3
26845,Sheldon,4," Yeah, once again, I know.",6,Big Bang Theory,26,5
26846,Penny,4," All right, round one. Here.",6,Big Bang Theory,28,5
26847,Sheldon,4, Got it.,6,Big Bang Theory,8,2
26848,Penny,4," Okay. Ready, set, go.",6,Big Bang Theory,22,4
26849,Amy,4," Uh, box? Uh, window?",6,Big Bang Theory,21,4
26850,Leonard,4," Batman. Batman and Robin. Uh, Wonder Twins plus the monkey. Wonder Twins plus the monkey and Batman.",6,Big Bang Theory,101,17
26851,Amy,4," Uh, gift? Uh, Present!",6,Big Bang Theory,23,4
26852,Penny,4, Present! Yeah!,6,Big Bang Theory,15,2
26853,Sheldon,4," Oh, Leonard. Now, how can you not get that?",6,Big Bang Theory,44,9
26854,Leonard,4, In what universe is that a present?,6,Big Bang Theory,36,7
26855,Sheldon,4," It's not a present, it's the present. Look. There's you and me. There's Penny and Amy. We're playing Pictionary. In the present.",6,Big Bang Theory,129,22
26856,Penny,4," Oh, my God, we're gonna kill them.",6,Big Bang Theory,35,7
26857,Sheldon,4, It's a quark-gluon plasma.,6,Big Bang Theory,27,4
26858,Leonard,4, No.,6,Big Bang Theory,4,1
26859,Sheldon,4, It's asymptotically free partons inside a quark-gluon plasma.,6,Big Bang Theory,62,8
26860,Leonard,4, Nothing with quarks.,6,Big Bang Theory,21,3
26861,Sheldon,4, It's an observational rebuttal of the Lambda-CDM model of the universe.,6,Big Bang Theory,72,11
26862,Leonard,4, No.,6,Big Bang Theory,4,1
26863,Penny,4, It's a chocolate chip cookie.,6,Big Bang Theory,30,5
26864,Amy,4, Yes.,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
26865,Leonard,4, How could you miss that?,6,Big Bang Theory,25,5
26866,Sheldon,4," Hey, if you want someone to guess chocolate chip cookie, you draw a glass of milk next to it.",6,Big Bang Theory,94,19
26867,Leonard,4, Penny got it.,6,Big Bang Theory,14,3
26868,Sheldon,4," Yeah, only after I eliminated all the obvious answers. You're welcome.",6,Big Bang Theory,71,11
26869,Leonard,4," Oh, uh, uh, uh, sausage. Uh, uh, uh, uh, bratwurst? Oh, oh, a hot dog.",6,Big Bang Theory,71,15
26870,Amy,4," Penny, aren't you gonna draw something?",6,Big Bang Theory,40,6
26871,Penny,4," Relax, we got time, this is so fun.",6,Big Bang Theory,36,8
26872,Sheldon,4, There.,6,Big Bang Theory,7,1
26873,Leonard,4," A solar system. Uh, uh, uh, uh, um, unidentified flying liverwurst? I don't",6,Big Bang Theory,76,13
26874,Amy,4, Now?,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
26875,Penny,4, Soon.,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
26876,Sheldon,4," Come on, Leonard, I am spoon-feeding this to you.",6,Big Bang Theory,50,9
26877,Leonard,4," I don't know, uh, Casper the alcoholic ghost?",6,Big Bang Theory,46,8
26878,Penny,4," All right, that's enough. ",6,Big Bang Theory,27,4
26879,Amy,4," Uh, hand. Uh, nail, polish?",6,Big Bang Theory,28,5
26880,Penny,4, Yep!,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
26881,Sheldon,4," Wait, no, no. No. The word is Polish. See, look. Polish sausage. And the, the model of the solar system developed by Nicolaus Copernicus, a Polish astronomer. And then, finally, if that wasn't enough, which it should have been, this is Madame Curie killing herself by discovering radium, who, although she was a naturalized French citizen, was Polish by birth.",6,Big Bang Theory,361,60
26882,Penny,4," Excuse me, the word is polish. See? Small P.",6,Big Bang Theory,45,9
26883,Sheldon,4, Ah. So it is. I guess we both share blame on this one.,6,Big Bang Theory,55,13
26885,Howard,4," Bernie, you okay?",6,Big Bang Theory,18,3
26887,Howard,4, Did you get a sea lion while I was gone?,6,Big Bang Theory,41,10
26889,Howard,4, Okay.,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
26891,Howard,4, Oh. Are you kidding? Every minute of every,6,Big Bang Theory,43,8
26893,Howard,4," Sweetie, we don't have to do this now.",6,Big Bang Theory,39,8
26895,Howard,4, You okay?,6,Big Bang Theory,10,2
26897,Howard,4, Okay.,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
26899,Howard,4, Bernadette? Bernie? Bernie?,6,Big Bang Theory,28,3
26901,Howard,4," Well, that was quick, and a little gross. Now, I know how she feels.",6,Big Bang Theory,69,14
26903,Penny,4," Hey, Sheldon, you're always full of fun little facts. Where did the expression got your ass handed to you come from?",6,Big Bang Theory,117,21
26904,Sheldon,4, Don't know.,6,Big Bang Theory,12,2
26905,Penny,4," I wonder if it's from, like, ancient Rome where they'd actually chop somebody's ass off and then go, here. You know, to appease Loseroneous, the god of losers.",6,Big Bang Theory,160,28
26906,Sheldon,4, I am not a loser. Pictionary is not a true test of any real intelligence or skill.,6,Big Bang Theory,83,17
26907,Leonard,4," Mmm, in all fairness, Pictionary has verbal skills, visual skills. It's a pretty well-rounded game.",6,Big Bang Theory,100,15
26908,Sheldon,4, Lot of big talk from a man who can't draw a chocolate chip cookie.,6,Big Bang Theory,67,14
26909,Penny,4," All right, fine, pick another game. Amy and I will beat you at anything.",6,Big Bang Theory,73,14
26910,Sheldon,4, All right. Let's play Physics Fiesta.,6,Big Bang Theory,38,6
26911,Penny,4," Oh, come on, what is that?",6,Big Bang Theory,27,6
26912,Sheldon,4," It's a game that I just invented, in which the participants answer physics questions in remedial Spanish. Um, ¿DÃ_nde estÃ¡ el boson de Higgs?",6,Big Bang Theory,143,24
26913,Leonard,4, En el acelerador de particulares.,6,Big Bang Theory,34,5
26914,Sheldon,4," Bueno, mi amigo.",6,Big Bang Theory,17,3
26915,Penny,4," No, no, we're not playing some dumb made-up game.",6,Big Bang Theory,50,9
26916,Sheldon,4," All games are made up. They're not found in nature. You don't just dig in the ground, come across a rich vein of Rock'em Sock'em Robots.",6,Big Bang Theory,137,26
26917,Leonard,4, Just pick another game.,6,Big Bang Theory,24,4
26918,Amy,4, Why don't we do something athletic like go over to the university pool and play water polo?,6,Big Bang Theory,92,17
26919,Leonard,4," No good, Sheldon doesn't float.",6,Big Bang Theory,32,5
26920,Sheldon,4," That is true. I have a higher than normal body density. If I run too deep a bath, I drown.",6,Big Bang Theory,91,20
26921,Amy,4," All right, let's keep it simple. How about darts?",6,Big Bang Theory,50,9
26922,Sheldon,4," No, that's not fair either.",6,Big Bang Theory,28,5
26923,Penny,4, Why not?,6,Big Bang Theory,9,2
26924,Sheldon,4, Darts is a bar game. You've been frequenting drinking establishments since you were of legal age.,6,Big Bang Theory,98,16
26925,Leonard,4," Yeah, that's when it started.",6,Big Bang Theory,30,5
26926,Sheldon,4," Well, regardless, she has a distinct advantage in all tavern-based competitions. Pool, beer pong, wet T-shirt contests, they're all out.",6,Big Bang Theory,137,20
26927,Penny,4," Okay. Just for the record, I have never entered a wet T-shirt contest. I've won a few, but that's just because I spill when I'm drunk, so",6,Big Bang Theory,138,27
26928,Amy,4, We could go to the cadaver lab at UCLA and play real-life Operation.,6,Big Bang Theory,69,13
26929,Sheldon,4, No.,6,Big Bang Theory,4,1
26930,Leonard,4, Uh-uh.,6,Big Bang Theory,7,1
26931,Penny,4, I don't think so.,6,Big Bang Theory,18,4
26932,Amy,4," Are you sure? I mean, the nose doesn't light up, but if the corpse is fresh enough, sometimes you can get the leg to jerk.",6,Big Bang Theory,123,25
26934,Howard,4," Hey, Ma, twinkle, twinkle, your little star is home. Ma, the chain's on the door.",6,Big Bang Theory,82,15
26936,Howard,4," Yeah, well, Bernie's not feeling well, so I thought I'd stop by, tell you about the greatest adventure of my life, see if you can make me feel bad about it.",6,Big Bang Theory,157,31
26938,Howard,4, All right. Woman hasn't tied her robe in 20 years. Suddenly she's not decent?,6,Big Bang Theory,78,14
26941,Howard,4," Ma, who is in there?",6,Big Bang Theory,21,5
26944,Howard,4, Who is that?,6,Big Bang Theory,13,3
26946,Howard,4," If you're busy, I can come back.",6,Big Bang Theory,33,7
26948,Howard,4, Dr. Schneider?,6,Big Bang Theory,15,2
26950,Howard,4, What are you doing here?,6,Big Bang Theory,25,5
26952,Howard,4, You're a dentist.,6,Big Bang Theory,18,3
26955,Penny,4," Okay, glasses off. Find Waldo.",6,Big Bang Theory,31,5
26956,Sheldon,4," Hurry up, find him, find him.",6,Big Bang Theory,30,6
26957,Leonard,4, I'm trying. Don't yell at me.,6,Big Bang Theory,30,6
26958,Sheldon,4," For goodness' sake, he's wearing a hat, glasses, and a red striped shirt.",6,Big Bang Theory,74,13
26959,Leonard,4, I know what he looks like.,6,Big Bang Theory,27,6
26960,Amy,4," Oh, there he is, I got him.",6,Big Bang Theory,28,7
26961,Penny,4," Yes, we win again.",6,Big Bang Theory,19,4
26962,Sheldon,4, How could you not find him?,6,Big Bang Theory,28,6
26963,Leonard,4," Because he's hard to find. If he was easy to find, the books would be called There's Waldo.",6,Big Bang Theory,92,18
26964,Leonard,4," 57, 58, 59, that's one minute.",6,Big Bang Theory,31,6
26965,Amy,4," Long division, long division. Go, go, go.",6,Big Bang Theory,42,7
26966,Leonard,4," Remember, show your work.",6,Big Bang Theory,26,4
26967,Sheldon,4, I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm not okay.,6,Big Bang Theory,34,7
26968,Leonard,4," Get up, we can't lose at math.",6,Big Bang Theory,31,7
26969,Penny,4,37,6,Big Bang Theory,2,1
26970,Amy,4, Yes.,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
26971,Amy,4," Ready, set, wrestle.  One, two, three, pin.",6,Big Bang Theory,44,7
26972,Penny,4, Mwah!,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
26973,Sheldon,4, Stop that.,6,Big Bang Theory,11,2
26974,Penny,4, Mwah!,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
26975,Sheldon,4," Amy, do something. Amy, help. Amy, stop that. Amy, Penny, both of you, stop it.",6,Big Bang Theory,80,15
26977,Howard,4, One to beam aboard?,6,Big Bang Theory,20,4
26978,Raj,4," Oh, my God, you're back. Oh, look at you. You, you look like you grew.",6,Big Bang Theory,71,15
26979,Howard,4," Yeah. The lack of gravity did decompress my spine, so I'm like an inch and a half taller. I'm going to the DMV tomorrow to get my license changed before I shrink back.",6,Big Bang Theory,168,33
26980,Raj,4," Oh, uh, come in, come in. Oh, I, uh, I didn't think I was going to get to see you until tomorrow.",6,Big Bang Theory,98,22
26981,Howard,4," Yeah, well, Bernadette's a little under the weather and my mom's kind of under my dentist.",6,Big Bang Theory,91,16
26982,Raj,4," Wait, your, your mother is sleeping with your dentist?",6,Big Bang Theory,55,9
26983,Howard,4, Former dentist. I need a new one now that I know where his hands have been.,6,Big Bang Theory,76,16
26984,Raj,4, So you're wandering all around by yourself? That's not the kind of hero's welcome an astronaut should come home to.,6,Big Bang Theory,116,20
26985,Howard,4," It's okay, you know, we space cowboys don't do what we do for glory and fame. We leave that to your rock stars and your athletes and your Howie Mandels.",6,Big Bang Theory,153,30
26987,Howard,4," Oh, Stuart, thanks. What are you doing here?",6,Big Bang Theory,45,8
26989,Raj,4," Just until he gets back on his feet, which are looking pretty good in the boots I bought him for his birthday.",6,Big Bang Theory,111,22
26991,Howard,4," Wow, so you guys are like buds now?",6,Big Bang Theory,36,8
26992,Raj,4," Oh, yeah, we hang out all the time.",6,Big Bang Theory,36,8
26994,Raj,4," It's like we both had these holes in our lives, but now we fill each other's holes.",6,Big Bang Theory,84,17
26996,Raj,4, Which part?,6,Big Bang Theory,12,2
26998,Howard,4," Okay, so what do you guys got going on tonight?",6,Big Bang Theory,48,10
27000,Howard,4," Sound of Music sing-along? That used to be our thing, but that's cool.",6,Big Bang Theory,71,13
27001,Raj,4," Oh, Howard, it's still our thing. Come with us, we'll, we'll get you a scalped ticket.",6,Big Bang Theory,87,16
27002,Howard,4, So I'd be sitting by myself?,6,Big Bang Theory,29,6
27003,Raj,4, We'll switch. You'll come sit with me after intermission.,6,Big Bang Theory,58,9
27005,Howard,4," No, no, you guys go. Have fun.",6,Big Bang Theory,31,7
27006,Raj,4," Okay, uh, will I get to see you tomorrow?",6,Big Bang Theory,42,9
27007,Howard,4," Absolutely. See you, Stuart.",6,Big Bang Theory,29,4
27009,Howard,4, At least my mother made her boyfriend climb out the window.,6,Big Bang Theory,60,11
27011,Penny,4," All right, standard state fair pie-eating contest rules are, no hands, first one to clean the pan wins.",6,Big Bang Theory,104,18
27012,Amy,4," On the count of three. One, two",6,Big Bang Theory,32,7
27013,Sheldon,4, Wait. I'm a little concerned. Blueberries are rich in antioxidants.,6,Big Bang Theory,68,10
27014,Leonard,4, So?,6,Big Bang Theory,4,1
27015,Sheldon,4," So, with all those antioxidants, what if I run out of oxidants?",6,Big Bang Theory,64,12
27016,Leonard,4," Sheldon, we haven't won a game all night. Now, you either stick your face in that pie or I'm gonna stick that pie in your face.",6,Big Bang Theory,128,26
27017,Sheldon,4, That's rude.,6,Big Bang Theory,13,2
27018,Amy,4," One, two, three, eat.",6,Big Bang Theory,22,4
27019,Howard,4," Hey, guys, guess who's back from space.",6,Big Bang Theory,40,7
27021,Sheldon,4," Oh, ow, blueberry in my nose, blueberry in my nose!",6,Big Bang Theory,52,10
27022,Leonard,4, Snort it down and keep eating!,6,Big Bang Theory,31,6
27025,Howard,4, I don't think so.,6,Big Bang Theory,18,4
27027,Howard,4," Yes. Yes, I am.",6,Big Bang Theory,16,4
27029,Howard,4," Oh, thank you so much. I've been having the worst night. I just got back, and my friends don't care, my wife's sick, I went to my mom",6,Big Bang Theory,134,28
27031,Howard,4," Yes, please.  And I think it's gonna be long, long time till touchdown brings me 'round again to find I'm not the man they think I am at home, oh, no, oh, no, I'm a rocket man.  Perfect.",6,Big Bang Theory,187,38
27033,Howard,5," Oh, hey, Stuart, I got you a little souvenir from my trip to space.",6,Big Bang Theory,68,14
27035,Leonard,5," Yeah, maybe. Open it first.",6,Big Bang Theory,28,5
27036,Howard,5, It's my official NASA portrait.,6,Big Bang Theory,32,5
27038,Sheldon,5," For the record, he also thinks the Walgreens and the dry cleaners are out of this world.",6,Big Bang Theory,89,17
27039,Howard,5, That's not true. At the Walgreens I was over the moon for their store-brand antacids.,6,Big Bang Theory,86,15
27040,Raj,5," Hey, Stuart, I see you're getting ready for your Halloween party.",6,Big Bang Theory,66,11
27042,Raj,5, Would you like me to help? I do have a certain je ne sais quois when it comes to soirees.,6,Big Bang Theory,90,20
27044,Raj,5," You know, you don't worry about money. I'll take care of everything.",6,Big Bang Theory,69,12
27046,Raj,5," Yeah, you'll love it. Ain't no party like a Koothra-party.",6,Big Bang Theory,59,10
27047,Howard,5," But you know what wasn't a party? That hotel in Kazakhstan they put you up in before the launch. I mean, it's your last night on Earth. You'd think you'd get one porn channel.",6,Big Bang Theory,176,34
27048,Leonard,5, Have you noticed that Howard can take any topic and use it to remind you that he went to space?,6,Big Bang Theory,96,20
27049,Sheldon,5," Interesting hypothesis. Let's apply the scientific method, perform an experiment.",6,Big Bang Theory,82,10
27050,Leonard,5," Okay. Hey, Howard, any thoughts on where we should get dinner?",6,Big Bang Theory,63,11
27051,Howard,5," Anywhere but the Space Station. On a good day, dinner was a bag full of meat loaf. But, hey, you don't go there for the food, you go there for the view.",6,Big Bang Theory,153,32
27052,Sheldon,5," It's fascinating. Let me see if I can duplicate the result. Howard, I've always thought the lemon was an underrated fruit. Care to weigh in?",6,Big Bang Theory,141,25
27053,Howard,5, Not really.,6,Big Bang Theory,12,2
27054,Sheldon,5," Oh, well.",6,Big Bang Theory,10,2
27055,Howard,5," You know, people say the Soyuz capsule was a lemon. But, hey, that baby got me to space and back.",6,Big Bang Theory,98,20
27057,Amy,5, Ladies night at the Cheesecake Factory. Does it get any better than this?,6,Big Bang Theory,74,13
27058,Penny,5, I hope so.,6,Big Bang Theory,11,3
27059,Amy,5, Question. Do you think your husband's fondness for turtlenecks is an expression of longing for his missing foreskin?,6,Big Bang Theory,117,18
27060,Penny,5, It's not getting any better.  Ugh. It's Leonard. He wants to go costume shopping later.,6,Big Bang Theory,88,15
27062,Penny,5," I do, it's just he wants to go to that party at the comic book store. A lot of the guys that hang out there are kind of creepy.",6,Big Bang Theory,128,29
27064,Amy,5, And my boyfriend?,6,Big Bang Theory,18,3
27065,Penny,5," I'm, I'm sorry, Amy. You were saying something about Howard's foreskin?",6,Big Bang Theory,72,11
27067,Penny,5," Yeah, I'm gonna go. It's just not my idea of a good time.",6,Big Bang Theory,58,13
27069,Penny,5," Well, yeah, he's my boyfriend. Isn't that, like, his job?",6,Big Bang Theory,58,10
27070,Amy,5, Then what's your job?,6,Big Bang Theory,22,4
27071,Penny,5, Letting him make me happy.,6,Big Bang Theory,27,5
27073,Amy,5," That's not always true. Last night I gave Sheldon my best come-hither look, and he responded by explaining how wheat came to be cultivated.",6,Big Bang Theory,140,24
27074,Penny,5, I guess I could probably try a little harder.,6,Big Bang Theory,46,9
27076,Penny,5," Yeah, that's kind of a problem.",6,Big Bang Theory,32,6
27077,Amy,5, Why?,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
27078,Penny,5, Not really clear on what he does.,6,Big Bang Theory,34,7
27080,Penny,5," Yeah, I'm not really clear on what that means.",6,Big Bang Theory,47,9
27081,Amy,5, He takes hypotheses and designs protocols to determine their accuracy.,6,Big Bang Theory,71,10
27082,Penny,5," Yeah, you're really just making it worse.",6,Big Bang Theory,42,7
27084,Sheldon,5, What kind of tea would you like?,6,Big Bang Theory,33,7
27085,Amy,5, I think I'm gonna try green tea mixed with lemon zinger.,6,Big Bang Theory,57,11
27086,Sheldon,5, Two tea bags in one cup? You're not at a rave.,6,Big Bang Theory,47,11
27087,Amy,5," So, listen, Sheldon, I was thinking, since this is gonna be our first Halloween party as boyfriend and girlfriend, I thought it might be fun for us to go in a couples costume.",6,Big Bang Theory,176,33
27088,Sheldon,5, I couldn't agree more.,6,Big Bang Theory,23,4
27089,Amy,5, Really? I find that inconsistent with everything I know about you.,6,Big Bang Theory,67,11
27090,Sheldon,5," Oh, oh, on the contrary. Couples costumes are one of the few benefits of being in a relationship. Now imagine this, you and I entering Stuart's party and all eyes turn to see America's most beloved and glamorous couple.",6,Big Bang Theory,220,39
27091,Amy,5, Yeah?,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
27092,Sheldon,5, R2-D2 and C-3PO. Dibs on Threepio.,6,Big Bang Theory,35,6
27093,Amy,5," Sheldon, when I said couples costume, I meant like Romeo and Juliet or Cinderella and Prince Charming, not two robots from some silly movie I don't even like.",6,Big Bang Theory,159,28
27094,Sheldon,5," Okay, I'm gonna let that slide because I know you're hopped up on tea bags.",6,Big Bang Theory,76,15
27095,Amy,5," I make compromises for you all the time. Just this once, can't we find something that we're both happy with?",6,Big Bang Theory,109,20
27096,Sheldon,5, Fine. How about one of the most beguiling and influential couples of the 20th century? Hewlett and Packard. Dibs on Hewlett. What? You want to be Hewlett?,6,Big Bang Theory,155,27
27098,Penny,5, Anybody home?,6,Big Bang Theory,14,2
27099,Leonard,5," Hey, what are you doing here?",6,Big Bang Theory,30,6
27100,Penny,5, I just thought I'd stop by and say hello.,6,Big Bang Theory,42,9
27101,Leonard,5," Oh, what a nice surprise. I don't think you've ever seen my lab before.",6,Big Bang Theory,72,14
27102,Penny,5," No, I know. It's long overdue. So, what ya doing? Better not be building a robot girlfriend.",6,Big Bang Theory,93,17
27103,Leonard,5, No. Although Howard was making some real strides in that area until he met Bernadette.,6,Big Bang Theory,87,15
27104,Penny,5, You're kidding.,6,Big Bang Theory,16,2
27105,Leonard,5, Nope. Now the Lisatronic 3000 just sits in a box waiting for the phone to ring.,6,Big Bang Theory,80,16
27106,Penny,5, Ooh! What's going on in here?,6,Big Bang Theory,30,6
27107,Leonard,5," Oh, no, no, no, don't look in there.",6,Big Bang Theory,37,8
27108,Penny,5," What, is it secret?",6,Big Bang Theory,20,4
27109,Leonard,5," No, it's a nitrogen laser. It'll cook your eyeball like a soft-boiled egg.",6,Big Bang Theory,75,13
27110,Penny,5, Oh. You might want to put a sign on it.,6,Big Bang Theory,40,10
27111,Leonard,5, Sign right there.,6,Big Bang Theory,18,3
27112,Penny,5," Ah. Danger. Sure, sure. Yeah. What's, what's that?",6,Big Bang Theory,51,8
27113,Leonard,5," Uh, that is an integrated ion trap and time-of-flight mass spectrometer.",6,Big Bang Theory,73,11
27114,Penny,5, Wow. High-techie-techie. What's this little box?,6,Big Bang Theory,49,6
27115,Leonard,5, That is a pencil sharpener.,6,Big Bang Theory,28,5
27116,Penny,5," Ooh, low-techie-techie. So, what are you working on right now?",6,Big Bang Theory,63,10
27117,Leonard,5, It's actually pretty neat.,6,Big Bang Theory,27,4
27118,Penny,5, Yeah?,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
27119,Leonard,5," Yeah. It's a front-projected holographic display combined with laser-based finger tracking. Here, I'll show you. We'll just put this pencil over here.",6,Big Bang Theory,151,22
27120,Penny,5, Sharp. Thanks to the machine we saw earlier.,6,Big Bang Theory,45,8
27121,Leonard,5," Very good. And then a laser will map the reflective surface, and voila. ",6,Big Bang Theory,73,13
27122,Penny,5, Wow. That is amazing.,6,Big Bang Theory,22,4
27123,Leonard,5," You know, there's a foundational idea in string theory that the whole universe may be a hologram.",6,Big Bang Theory,98,17
27124,Penny,5, What do you mean? . Oh! Wow!,6,Big Bang Theory,29,7
27125,Leonard,5," Uh-huh. Well, the holographic principle suggests that what we all experience every day in three dimensions may really  just be information  on a surface located at the farthest reaches of our cosmos.  So it's possible that our lives are really just acting out a painting on the largest canvas in the universe.",6,Big Bang Theory,310,52
27126,Penny,5, Hmm.,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
27127,Leonard,5, What?,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
27128,Penny,5, Sometimes I forget how smart you are.,6,Big Bang Theory,38,7
27129,Leonard,5, You should visit more often. What are you doing?,6,Big Bang Theory,49,9
27130,Penny,5, Take off your clothes.,6,Big Bang Theory,23,4
27131,Leonard,5, What? Here? Now?,6,Big Bang Theory,17,3
27132,Penny,5, Yeah. You got a problem with that?,6,Big Bang Theory,35,7
27133,Leonard,5," No, no. It's kind of crazy. I've never fooled around in the lab before.",6,Big Bang Theory,72,14
27134,Penny,5, Really? Never?,6,Big Bang Theory,15,2
27135,Leonard,5," No. I did have a shot with the Lisatronic, but the extension cord wasn't long enough.",6,Big Bang Theory,86,16
27137,Raj,5," Before I forget, I'd like your opinion on the menus I've prepared for the Halloween party. The theme is food that goes bump in the night.",6,Big Bang Theory,138,26
27138,Howard,5, Creature from the Black Forest Ham Lagoon.,6,Big Bang Theory,43,7
27139,Raj,5, On Sesame seed Bunzillas.,6,Big Bang Theory,26,4
27140,Sheldon,5, Night of the Living Garlic Bread?,6,Big Bang Theory,34,6
27141,Raj,5, It's funny because bread sounds like dead.,6,Big Bang Theory,43,7
27142,Sheldon,5," I'm sorry, but these are just ordinary foods with the names bent into tortured puns. The dishes themselves are in no way Halloweenie.",6,Big Bang Theory,134,23
27143,Raj,5," Ooh, Hallow-weenies! That's a good one. They'll pair nicely with my Draculoni and Cheese. How do I do it?",6,Big Bang Theory,106,19
27144,Howard,5," That reminds me, I was thinking about wearing my NASA jumpsuit as a costume. But then I realized everyone would be, like, where's your costume? Why are you wearing your work clothes, you nut?",6,Big Bang Theory,192,34
27145,Leonard,5," Hello, boys.",6,Big Bang Theory,13,2
27146,Sheldon,5, What are you smiling at?,6,Big Bang Theory,25,5
27147,Leonard,5, Nothing.,6,Big Bang Theory,9,1
27148,Howard,5, You know where's there's a lot of nothing.,6,Big Bang Theory,43,8
27151,Howard,5," Boy, it's nice to sleep in a bed with gravity again. Did I tell you about the night my retainer floated out of my mouth and into the air lock?",6,Big Bang Theory,143,30
27153,Howard,5," So, here we are, just a couple of young newlyweds. What to do? What to do to you? Astronaut Wolowitz, reporting for booty. Preparing thrusters. We have liftoff. Are we clear to jettison that nightgown?",6,Big Bang Theory,202,35
27155,Howard,5, What?,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
27157,Howard,5, I don't talk about it every minute.,6,Big Bang Theory,36,7
27159,Howard,5, What was I supposed to talk about? We were eating at Johnny Rockets.,6,Big Bang Theory,69,13
27161,Howard,5," So, I did this amazing thing and I'm never allowed to mention it?",6,Big Bang Theory,66,13
27163,Howard,5," Okay, no problem. It won't happen again.",6,Big Bang Theory,41,7
27165,Howard,5," I love you, too. I can't tell you how many times I dreamed I was in bed here with you when I was you know. What, I can't even point?",6,Big Bang Theory,133,30
27167,Leonard,5," So, basically, this is what's called mag-lev technology. It uses very powerful electromagnets to create a force strong enough to overcome gravity. Here, you hold this.",6,Big Bang Theory,168,26
27168,Penny,5, Whoa! That's heavy.,6,Big Bang Theory,20,3
27169,Leonard,5," Yeah. Oh, uh, you don't have on any jewellery, do you?",6,Big Bang Theory,55,11
27170,Penny,5, No. Why?,6,Big Bang Theory,9,2
27171,Leonard,5, A grad student forgot to take out one of his piercings. Now he's on a transplant list waiting for a nipple his size. Now watch this.,6,Big Bang Theory,133,26
27172,Penny,5, Whoa! That is very cool.,6,Big Bang Theory,25,5
27173,Leonard,5, Sometimes I like to turn this on and pretend I'm the super villain Magneto.,6,Big Bang Theory,76,14
27174,Penny,5," Getting a little less cool, Leonard.",6,Big Bang Theory,37,6
27175,Leonard,5, But what I really am is a very smart scientist who understands the mechanics of the universe and is wearing the sexy black underwear you bought him.,6,Big Bang Theory,149,27
27176,Penny,5, There we go.,6,Big Bang Theory,13,3
27178,Raj,5," So, I thought the photo booth for the party could either be creepy like a mummy's tomb, or they also have the Tardis from Doctor Who.",6,Big Bang Theory,134,26
27179,Sheldon,5," A Tardis makes no sense. It's a time machine from a science-fiction show. It has nothing to do with Halloween. That being said, if you don't get a Tardis, you stink and your party stinks.",6,Big Bang Theory,188,35
27180,Raj,5, Do you have a preference?,6,Big Bang Theory,26,5
27181,Howard,5, I don't care. Get the Tardis.,6,Big Bang Theory,30,6
27182,Sheldon,5, Yes! This party just became a major rager.,6,Big Bang Theory,43,8
27183,Raj,5," Oh, by the way, can I borrow your bullwhip and fedora?",6,Big Bang Theory,55,11
27184,Howard,5," Yeah, sure, whatever.",6,Big Bang Theory,22,3
27185,Raj,5, I was thinking of dressing up as Indiana Jones' mocha-skinned love child. Indian Jones.,6,Big Bang Theory,88,14
27186,Howard,5, Clever.,6,Big Bang Theory,8,1
27187,Raj,5, What's wrong with you?,6,Big Bang Theory,23,4
27188,Howard,5, Nothing.,6,Big Bang Theory,9,1
27189,Raj,5," Oh, Howard, I've got a party to plan. Don't make me pull it out of you.",6,Big Bang Theory,72,16
27190,Howard,5," Okay, here it is. Bernadette said you guys are all sick of me talking about my trip to space. Is that true?",6,Big Bang Theory,108,22
27191,Sheldon,5, Yes.,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
27192,Raj,5, No.,6,Big Bang Theory,4,1
27193,Sheldon,5, We seem to have different approaches here. I was going for helpful honesty. I have no idea what you're doing.,6,Big Bang Theory,110,20
27194,Raj,5, It's called being nice.,6,Big Bang Theory,24,4
27195,Sheldon,5," Okay. If you think being nice will get him to shut up, I'll try it.",6,Big Bang Theory,68,15
27196,Howard,5," You know what, guys? Never mind. I just won't talk about the greatest achievement of my life ever again.",6,Big Bang Theory,105,19
27197,Sheldon,5," Look at that, the problem solved itself.",6,Big Bang Theory,41,7
27198,Leonard,5," Hello, boys.",6,Big Bang Theory,13,2
27200,Sheldon,5, What if we were to go as dinner table favourites salt and pepper?,6,Big Bang Theory,66,13
27201,Amy,5, You know salt makes me retain water and my cousin William was ground to death in a pepper factory accident. How about Raggedy Ann and Andy? I loved them growing up.,6,Big Bang Theory,165,31
27202,Sheldon,5," No, I don't think so. Those dolls represent three things I do not care for, clowns, children and raggediness. I think it's a lost cause.",6,Big Bang Theory,137,25
27203,Amy,5," No. There are certain things that say to the world, I have a boyfriend, and he's not made up. Matching costumes, hickeys and sex tapes. Pick one.",6,Big Bang Theory,146,27
27204,Sheldon,5, What's a hickey?,6,Big Bang Theory,17,3
27207,Howard,5, Fine.,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
27209,Howard,5," To tell you the truth, I'm not really in the mood.",6,Big Bang Theory,51,11
27211,Howard,5," Yeah, some friends. They all think I'm boring. Maybe you should go without me.",6,Big Bang Theory,79,14
27213,Howard,5, I'm sorry. I just don't want to go.,6,Big Bang Theory,36,8
27215,Howard,5, Fine. Two weeks ago I was an astronaut.,6,Big Bang Theory,40,8
27218,Penny,5," Oh, my God, you guys look adorable.",6,Big Bang Theory,36,7
27220,Penny,5," No, sexy cop. Slutty cop only came with a skirt and two badges.",6,Big Bang Theory,64,13
27222,Leonard,5," Ja, und later she's going to arrest me for goink fashter zen da shpeed of light.",6,Big Bang Theory,81,16
27223,Penny,5," I thought we said in the car, no accents?",6,Big Bang Theory,42,9
27224,Leonard,5," Sorry, Officer.",6,Big Bang Theory,16,2
27229,Amy,5," Sheldon, get in here.",6,Big Bang Theory,22,4
27230,Sheldon,5, I should've picked hickey.,6,Big Bang Theory,27,4
27232,Amy,5," I'm Raggedy Ann, and he's Raggedy C-3PO.",6,Big Bang Theory,41,7
27233,Sheldon,5, It was a compromise. I lost.,6,Big Bang Theory,29,6
27234,Raj,5, Can you believe Stuart's walking around taking credit for this party?,6,Big Bang Theory,70,11
27235,Howard,5, Who cares?,6,Big Bang Theory,11,2
27236,Raj,5," What do you mean who cares? Look at what I pulled off here. The DJ's on fire, there's a Tardis photo booth in the back room, and, oh, my God, the food. Stuart wanted Kraft Draculoni and cheese.",6,Big Bang Theory,194,38
27237,Howard,5," You're right, the party's fantastic. Please, tell me more. I haven't heard enough about it all week because hearing about that never gets old.",6,Big Bang Theory,143,24
27238,Raj,5, Is this about the space thing again?,6,Big Bang Theory,37,7
27239,Howard,5," Well, I'm not allowed to talk about it, but since you brought it up, I went to space! Space, space! Space! Space, space! Space!",6,Big Bang Theory,128,24
27241,Howard,5," Great, now I'm in trouble. You happy?",6,Big Bang Theory,38,7
27243,Howard,5," No, I'm not. They're all being rude. And you're being rude.",6,Big Bang Theory,60,11
27245,Howard,5," Oh, Howie, stop talking about space so much. Nobody likes it.",6,Big Bang Theory,62,11
27247,Howard,5, You're my wife. You're supposed to be on my side.,6,Big Bang Theory,50,10
27249,Howard,5," Then why are you trying to take this away from me? Being an astronaut is the coolest thing I'm ever gonna do. If I stop talking about it, then I'm just",6,Big Bang Theory,152,31
27251,Howard,5, Just plain old Howard Wolowitz again.,6,Big Bang Theory,38,6
27253,Howard,5, You're just saying that.,6,Big Bang Theory,25,4
27255,Howard,5, I love you.,6,Big Bang Theory,12,3
27257,Penny,5, Nothing to see here. Just sexy police business.,6,Big Bang Theory,48,8
27258,Leonard,5, Just explaining the theory of relativity. Twice.,6,Big Bang Theory,49,7
27261,Howard,5, I don't know. Raj sent me some video of Buzz Aldrin.,6,Big Bang Theory,53,11
27263,Howard,5," Okay, I get it.",6,Big Bang Theory,16,4
27265,Raj,6," Try to keep up, Howard, I'm killing it.",6,Big Bang Theory,40,8
27266,Howard,6," Yeah, I wish we looked as cool dancing in clubs as we do right now.",6,Big Bang Theory,68,15
27267,Leonard,6," Don't worry, this is exactly how you look when you're dancing in clubs.",6,Big Bang Theory,72,13
27268,Raj,6," You're welcome, ladies.",6,Big Bang Theory,24,3
27269,Sheldon,6," Paradigm-shifting news, gentlemen. ",6,Big Bang Theory,36,3
27270,Raj,6, Dude! I was about to Bollywood this bitch.,6,Big Bang Theory,43,8
27271,Sheldon,6," Earlier today, I invited Professor Stephen Hawking to join me in the popular online game Words with Friends. Moments ago, he accepted my request. Do you understand what that means?",6,Big Bang Theory,181,30
27272,Howard,6," That somewhere right now Stephen Hawking is saying, damn it, I meant to click no.â€ù",6,Big Bang Theory,85,15
27273,Sheldon,6," I'll walk you through it. The game is not called Words with Strangers. No, it's not even called Words with Acquaintances. It is called Words with",6,Big Bang Theory,146,26
27274,Raj,6, I'm not finishing your sentence. You pulled the plug on my funk.,6,Big Bang Theory,65,12
27275,Sheldon,6," Friends! It's Words with Friends! Which Stephen Hawking and I officially are. Now all I need is a bunk bed with a slide, I'll have everything I've ever wanted since I was six years old.",6,Big Bang Theory,186,35
27276,Leonard,6," That's really nice, Sheldon, I'm happy for you.",6,Big Bang Theory,48,8
27277,Sheldon,6," And I'm happy for you, too. You are now friends with someone who is officially friends with Stephen Hawking. Enjoy it, boys. You may have peaked.",6,Big Bang Theory,146,26
27278,Howard,6," Sheldon, I know Stephen Hawking. I worked with him.",6,Big Bang Theory,52,9
27279,Sheldon,6," And if they ever come out with a game called Words with People You Once Worked With, you'll be off to the races.",6,Big Bang Theory,113,23
27280,Leonard,6," Sheldon, I don't think this actually means",6,Big Bang Theory,43,7
27281,Sheldon,6," Hold that thought! Professor Hawking has made a move. Boy, oh, boy. Oh, it's only a matter of time before we're coming up with fun nicknames for each other. I'll be Coop. He'll be Wheels. If he's okay with that. ",6,Big Bang Theory,213,40
27282,Raj,6," All right. Crank up the AC, boys, it's gonna get hot in here!",6,Big Bang Theory,62,13
27285,Amy,6, I once looked in Sheldon's underwear drawer. He yelled at me. But now I know what it looks like and he can never take that away.,6,Big Bang Theory,129,26
27287,Penny,6," Oh, I'll get that.",6,Big Bang Theory,19,4
27289,Penny,6," No, no, it's",6,Big Bang Theory,13,3
27291,Penny,6," No, it's not a big deal. Just taking a class at the Pasadena Community College.",6,Big Bang Theory,80,15
27293,Penny,6," It's just one history class. Look, I didn't finish college, so I thought I would give it a try.",6,Big Bang Theory,96,19
27294,Amy,6," Not to mention, your acting career is going south like Sherman. Read about it in your book.",6,Big Bang Theory,92,17
27296,Penny,6," No, I'm not embarrassed. I just didn't want anyone to know because I haven't told Leonard yet.",6,Big Bang Theory,95,17
27297,Amy,6, Why wouldn't you tell Leonard?,6,Big Bang Theory,31,5
27298,Penny,6," Because it's me going back to school, and he's gonna be all â€œyou can do it,â€ù and â€œhow can I help?â€ù and â€œI'm so proud of you.â€ù Ugh!",6,Big Bang Theory,143,28
27300,Amy,6, You guys have got to be the weirdest couple I know.,6,Big Bang Theory,52,11
27301,Penny,6, Really? You can't think of anyone weirder?,6,Big Bang Theory,43,7
27302,Amy,6," I can, but she's sitting right there.",6,Big Bang Theory,38,7
27304,Sheldon,6," Yes. I play the word quiver with a triple letter and a double word score for 72 points. That ought to let the air out of your tyres, Hawking.",6,Big Bang Theory,142,29
27305,Amy,6," Wow, my boyfriend is friends with Stephen Hawking and my new dandruff shampoo doesn't smell like tar. Everything really is coming up Amy.",6,Big Bang Theory,138,23
27306,Sheldon,6, It is glorious. One of the greatest intellects of our time has agreed to engage with me in a gentlemanly battle of wits. And I'm spanking him so hard his grad students won't be able to sit down.,6,Big Bang Theory,195,38
27307,Amy,6," You know, when one male dominates another, his testosterone level rises.",6,Big Bang Theory,73,11
27308,Sheldon,6, What's your point?,6,Big Bang Theory,19,3
27309,Amy,6, It's exciting to think you might be getting a testosterone level.,6,Big Bang Theory,66,11
27310,Sheldon,6," Ooh, my friend Stephen just played the word act for 18 points. That's right, I call him Stephen now, because I checked, and he was not okay with Wheels.",6,Big Bang Theory,153,29
27311,Amy,6," Oh, you could turn his act into extract , and it would be for double points.",6,Big Bang Theory,77,16
27312,Sheldon,6," Amy. Why would you give me a word? Now, if I play extract it would be cheating.",6,Big Bang Theory,80,17
27313,Amy,6, Sorry.,6,Big Bang Theory,7,1
27314,Sheldon,6," Although, I could play the completely unrelated and better word extract . Ethical conundrum avoided. Thanks, brain.",6,Big Bang Theory,116,17
27316,Penny,6, Spaghetti okay?,6,Big Bang Theory,16,2
27317,Leonard,6, It's crunchy. Just the way I like it.,6,Big Bang Theory,38,8
27318,Penny,6," Yeah, I don't think the water was really boiling.",6,Big Bang Theory,50,9
27319,Leonard,6, It's great. I love it.,6,Big Bang Theory,23,5
27320,Penny,6," Okay, listen, there's something I need to tell you. I've been thinking about going back to school for a while now. So a couple months ago, I started taking a history class at the community college.",6,Big Bang Theory,198,36
27321,Leonard,6," Oh. That's great. Great, great, great. Why wait so long to tell me?",6,Big Bang Theory,68,13
27322,Penny,6, I don't want you to make a big deal out of it.,6,Big Bang Theory,47,12
27323,Leonard,6," Why do you think I'd be like that? I get it, you're taking one class. It's nice. Maybe if it goes well, you take another, you enrol full-time. Ooh, be sure to keep an eye on which credits transfer to a four-year college.",6,Big Bang Theory,221,43
27324,Penny,6, You're making it a big deal.,6,Big Bang Theory,29,6
27325,Leonard,6, Sorry. Whatever. It's all good.,6,Big Bang Theory,32,5
27326,Penny,6," Anyway, that's it. I just thought you should know.",6,Big Bang Theory,51,9
27327,Leonard,6, Am I allowed to ask how the class is going?,6,Big Bang Theory,44,10
27328,Penny,6, It's really good. We've been talking about the origins of slavery. Turn in my first paper tomorrow.,6,Big Bang Theory,100,17
27329,Leonard,6," Great topic. I can help with that. There are lots of different perspectives you can take, economic, sociological, political.",6,Big Bang Theory,125,19
27330,Penny,6," Hey hey hey, this is my paper. And my perspective is that slavery is bad. Oh, and my professor's black, so I'm pretty sure that's the right answer.",6,Big Bang Theory,148,28
27331,Leonard,6, Can I take a look?,6,Big Bang Theory,19,5
27332,Penny,6," No, Leonard, this is my thing.",6,Big Bang Theory,31,6
27333,Leonard,6," Okay, I get it.",6,Big Bang Theory,16,4
27334,Penny,6, Thank you.,6,Big Bang Theory,11,2
27335,Leonard,6," It's like when I started doing chin-ups, I didn't want you to see until I could do one. FYI, really close.",6,Big Bang Theory,107,21
27336,Penny,6," Thank you. Now behave yourself and eat your dinner. Maybe later, if you're lucky, you get to sleep with a college girl.",6,Big Bang Theory,120,22
27337,Leonard,6," Really? â€˜Cause I went to four years of college and five years of grad school, that never happened once.",6,Big Bang Theory,106,19
27339,Raj,6," I think the next time I have to speak to a call centre in India, I'm going to try using an American accent.",6,Big Bang Theory,108,23
27340,Howard,6, Why?,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
27341,Raj,6," Because when I use my regular voice, I feel like I'm making fun of them.",6,Big Bang Theory,73,15
27342,Howard,6," That's ridiculous. Not to mention, your American accent is terrible.",6,Big Bang Theory,69,10
27343,Raj,6," Dude, my accent is brilliant.  Hey, my snow-white American friends, let's put some cow meat on the barbecue and eat it until we're all obese.",6,Big Bang Theory,142,25
27344,Howard,6," This is what you sound like. I think I'm talking in an American accent, but it really sounds like I'm wearing a set of giant dentures.",6,Big Bang Theory,135,26
27345,Raj,6," Sheldon, do I really sound like that?",6,Big Bang Theory,38,7
27346,Howard,6, Tell him he sounds like that.,6,Big Bang Theory,30,6
27347,Raj,6," Sheldon, you okay?",6,Big Bang Theory,19,3
27348,Sheldon,6, It's been three days. Why hasn't Stephen Hawking played a word?,6,Big Bang Theory,64,11
27349,Raj,6, The guy's a genius. Maybe you weren't challenging enough for him.,6,Big Bang Theory,66,11
27350,Sheldon,6, Not challenging? I was humiliating the man. I was thinking of writing a book called A Brief History of the Time I Made Stephen Hawking Cry Like a Little Girl.,6,Big Bang Theory,159,30
27351,Howard,6," There's the problem. You can't beat Hawking like that. He hates to lose. Everyone knows the guy's a big baby. I mean, forget the wheelchair, he should be in a stroller.",6,Big Bang Theory,169,31
27352,Sheldon,6, Really?,6,Big Bang Theory,8,1
27353,Howard,6," One time when I was working with him, he said that Johnny Depp was in The Matrix. I told him he was wrong, but he kept insisting. So I looked it up online and showed him. Well, the next day, he had a pizza party, and everyone got invited but me. And then he was all, your invitation must have gotten lost in the matrix.",6,Big Bang Theory,320,65
27354,Sheldon,6," Good Lord, what have I done?",6,Big Bang Theory,29,6
27355,Raj,6," Good Lord, what have I done?",6,Big Bang Theory,29,6
27356,Howard,6, Terrible.,6,Big Bang Theory,10,1
27357,Raj,6," All right, hotshot, let's hear your Indian.",6,Big Bang Theory,44,7
27358,Howard,6," I can't sit on that elephant, my ass is on fire from eating all this curry.",6,Big Bang Theory,76,16
27359,Raj,6," Okay, yeah, that's pretty good.",6,Big Bang Theory,32,5
27361,Leonard,6, Please be good. Please be good. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Okay. She writes like she cooks.,6,Big Bang Theory,81,14
27363,Sheldon,6, Play. Play. Play. Play. Play.,6,Big Bang Theory,30,5
27364,Leonard,6, What are you doing?,6,Big Bang Theory,20,4
27365,Sheldon,6, Trying to use a Jedi mind trick to control Stephen Hawking. Play. Play. Ugh! He must be wearing a tinfoil hat or something.,6,Big Bang Theory,124,23
27366,Leonard,6, I did a bad thing.,6,Big Bang Theory,19,5
27367,Sheldon,6, Does it affect me?,6,Big Bang Theory,19,4
27368,Leonard,6, No.,6,Big Bang Theory,4,1
27369,Sheldon,6, Then suffer in silence. Play. Play. Play.  Stephen Hawking.  Stephen Hawking.  Stephen Hawking.,6,Big Bang Theory,96,13
27370,Leonard,6," Penny started taking a class. She wrote a paper, she didn't want me to read it, I went behind her back and I read it anyway.",6,Big Bang Theory,125,26
27371,Sheldon,6, Stephen Hawking hates me.,6,Big Bang Theory,26,4
27372,Leonard,6," I don't know what to do. I mean, the paper's terrible. But if I tell her, she'll know that I read it and she'll get really mad.",6,Big Bang Theory,128,27
27373,Sheldon,6," I was beating him so bad, he doesn't want to be friends anymore. Why does everyone love me except Stephen Hawking?",6,Big Bang Theory,115,21
27374,Leonard,6, Is it possible we're having two different conversations?,6,Big Bang Theory,57,8
27375,Sheldon,6, How would I know? I'm not listening to you.,6,Big Bang Theory,44,9
27376,Leonard,6," Hang on. Okay, here's what we're gonna do. Chess clock. We each get five minutes to talk about our problems. We'll take turns. Each turn will consist of a statement and a helpful response from the friend. Begin.",6,Big Bang Theory,212,38
27377,Sheldon,6," I humiliated Stephen Hawking in a game of Words with Friends. He stopped playing, and now we're not friends anymore.",6,Big Bang Theory,117,20
27378,Leonard,6," He's probably busy. You're worried about nothing. Give it a couple more days. I'm sure he'll play, and you'll see that everything's fine. My turn. I can't let Penny hand in a bad paper, but how do I tell her it's bad without letting her know that I read it?",6,Big Bang Theory,258,50
27379,Sheldon,6," Hmm. Beats me. Now, I know Hawking's not busy because I can see he's playing other people right now.",6,Big Bang Theory,101,19
27380,Leonard,6," Maybe since you're so good, he's taking his time to meet the challenge. I want Penny to enjoy school",6,Big Bang Theory,101,19
27381,Sheldon,6," Wolowitz told me he's a big baby. But I didn't know that, and I played extract for 82 points. It's all Amy's fault. She told me to play it. I have got to cut her loose.",6,Big Bang Theory,169,36
27382,Leonard,6," Sheldon, I wasn't done talking. She hands in the paper tomorrow. I know I could help her. And she's my girlfriend. I, I should be allowed to help her. Why aren't I allowed to help her?",6,Big Bang Theory,185,36
27383,Sheldon,6," Yeah, I hear you, brother.",6,Big Bang Theory,27,5
27384,Leonard,6, No. You need to give me some advice.,6,Big Bang Theory,37,8
27385,Sheldon,6," Fine. Women, huh?",6,Big Bang Theory,18,3
27386,Leonard,6," No, specific to my situation.",6,Big Bang Theory,30,5
27387,Sheldon,6," Blonde women, huh?",6,Big Bang Theory,19,3
27388,Leonard,6, Empathetic.,6,Big Bang Theory,12,1
27389,Sheldon,6, It sucks to be you.,6,Big Bang Theory,20,5
27390,Leonard,6, I quit.,6,Big Bang Theory,8,2
27391,Sheldon,6," Leonard, wait. No. I listened to your dumb thing. Leonard, come back. Leonard, come back. Leonard, come back.",6,Big Bang Theory,110,18
27392,Leonard,6, What?,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
27393,Sheldon,6," Oh, of course, it only works on the weak-minded.",6,Big Bang Theory,49,9
27395,Leonard,6," Good morning, sunshine.",6,Big Bang Theory,24,3
27396,Penny,6, Leonard. It's eight a.m. It's like the middle of the night.,6,Big Bang Theory,60,11
27397,Leonard,6," I know, but I have to go to work, and I made you breakfast.",6,Big Bang Theory,60,14
27398,Penny,6," Oh, wow, that's so sweet. Hey, what's this?",6,Big Bang Theory,44,8
27399,Leonard,6," Uh, before you open that, um, are you familiar with the story of The Shoemaker and the Elves?",6,Big Bang Theory,94,18
27400,Penny,6," Elves? Come on, Leonard. It's too early for Lord of the Rings.",6,Big Bang Theory,63,12
27401,Leonard,6," No, no. Listen, um, once upon a time, there was this shoemaker and when he went to bed at night, elves would sneak in and they would make all these amazing shoes for him. And when the shoemaker woke up in the morning, he, he would be super happy, not mad at the elves at all. Open it.",6,Big Bang Theory,285,58
27402,Penny,6," Okay. An examination of the economic, cultural, and political roots of slavery in the Old South, 1619 to 1865. What the hell is this?",6,Big Bang Theory,134,24
27403,Leonard,6, Don't ask me. A little elf did it.,6,Big Bang Theory,35,8
27404,Penny,6, So let me get this straight. You just assumed my paper would be bad so you wrote one for me?,6,Big Bang Theory,93,20
27405,Leonard,6," No, I assumed it would be good. Then I read it.",6,Big Bang Theory,48,11
27406,Penny,6, What?,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
27407,Leonard,6," No, I, I mean, it was good. There were just a few things that needed a little polishing.",6,Big Bang Theory,89,18
27408,Penny,6, You changed every word.,6,Big Bang Theory,24,4
27409,Leonard,6," That's not true. Uh, slavery. 1619. Your name at the top. That's all you.",6,Big Bang Theory,74,14
27410,Penny,6, You are such an ass. This is exactly why I didn't want to tell you I was taking a class in the first place.,6,Big Bang Theory,108,24
27411,Leonard,6," Please don't be upset. I just, I didn't want you ending up with a bad grade and get discouraged and give up on the idea of going back to school.",6,Big Bang Theory,145,30
27412,Penny,6," Right, because me being in school is so important to you. That way, you wouldn't have to be dating someone who's only a waitress.",6,Big Bang Theory,130,24
27413,Leonard,6," Oh, come on, you know that's not true.",6,Big Bang Theory,39,8
27414,Penny,6," Do I? Listen to me. I need to do this on my own. If I fail, I fail. If I pass, I pass. Do you get it?",6,Big Bang Theory,102,27
27415,Leonard,6, I'm sorry. I was just trying to help.,6,Big Bang Theory,38,8
27416,Penny,6," Yeah, well, next time don't. Oh, and since you like stories so much, this is not The Shoemaker",6,Big Bang Theory,95,18
27418,Howard,6, You ever hear back from Hawking?,6,Big Bang Theory,33,6
27419,Sheldon,6, No. It would appear as if I've lost him. Stupid brain.,6,Big Bang Theory,55,11
27420,Raj,6, It'll be okay.,6,Big Bang Theory,15,3
27421,Sheldon,6, How can it be okay? Stephen Hawking's a genius and he talks like a robot. It's everything I've ever wanted in a friend.,6,Big Bang Theory,120,23
27422,Raj,6," Yeah, but if he's a sore loser, maybe you're better off without him.",6,Big Bang Theory,69,13
27423,Sheldon,6, You're right. I guess I just have to make lemonade out of the two of you. He played! He played! Coop and Rolling Thunder are together again. He was okay with that nickname.,6,Big Bang Theory,173,33
27424,Howard,6," So, now all you have to do is let him win.",6,Big Bang Theory,43,11
27425,Sheldon,6," Yeah, way ahead of you. I will play the word at for two measly points, throwing the game and thus securing my friendship with the smartest man in the world.",6,Big Bang Theory,157,30
27426,Howard,6, What are you waiting for? Hit send.,6,Big Bang Theory,36,7
27427,Sheldon,6, I can't. Losing on purpose is intellectually dishonest.,6,Big Bang Theory,56,8
27428,Raj,6, So don't do it.,6,Big Bang Theory,16,4
27429,Sheldon,6," Oh, but I want to be Hawking's friend.",6,Big Bang Theory,39,8
27430,Howard,6, So do it.,6,Big Bang Theory,10,3
27431,Sheldon,6," Oh, but if I do, I'll be a phony, a sellout, a Hollywood poser.",6,Big Bang Theory,64,14
27432,Raj,6, Then don't do it.,6,Big Bang Theory,18,4
27433,Sheldon,6," I won't. This feels right. My mother always said, to thine own self be true.",6,Big Bang Theory,77,15
27434,Howard,6, Good for you.,6,Big Bang Theory,14,3
27435,Sheldon,6," â€˜Course she also told me that every animal in the world got on one boat, so what does she know? And send.",6,Big Bang Theory,108,22
27437,Leonard,6," Oh, hey. Haven't heard from you in a couple days. You still mad at me?",6,Big Bang Theory,71,15
27438,Penny,6, Nope. I have no reason to â€œBâ€ù mad at you. Minus.,6,Big Bang Theory,53,11
27439,Leonard,6, Wow.,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
27440,Penny,6," That's right. On my paper. Not yours, mine, you punk-ass elf.",6,Big Bang Theory,62,11
27441,Leonard,6, I don't know what to say.,6,Big Bang Theory,26,6
27442,Penny,6," Hmm, how about, gee, Penny, you're smarter than I thought. You may be the one in school, but I'm the one who learned a lesson. I'm so stupid, Penny. Duh.",6,Big Bang Theory,154,30
27443,Sheldon,6, She sounds exactly like you.,6,Big Bang Theory,29,5
27445,Amy,6, How'd it go with Leonard?,6,Big Bang Theory,26,5
27446,Penny,6, I don't think he'll be making that mistake again.,6,Big Bang Theory,50,9
27448,Penny,6," So, I know this goes without saying, but if either of you tell Leonard you helped me rewrite this paper, I will beat you both with a bag of oranges.",6,Big Bang Theory,149,30
27449,Amy,6, Understood.,6,Big Bang Theory,12,1
27451,Penny,6," Now, ladies, we got a B-minus on this paper. I think if we put our heads together, on the next one we could get an A.",6,Big Bang Theory,118,26
27453,Penny,6, Believable? You saying I'm not smart?,6,Big Bang Theory,38,6
27455,Amy,6, You're smart.,6,Big Bang Theory,14,2
27456,Penny,6, That's better.,6,Big Bang Theory,15,2
27457,Amy,6, I feel like I'm in high school again.,6,Big Bang Theory,38,8
27459,Amy,6, I know. It's finally working.,6,Big Bang Theory,30,5
27461,Sheldon,6, It's Stephen Hawking.,6,Big Bang Theory,22,3
27462,Leonard,6, Well answer it. I want to hear.,6,Big Bang Theory,32,7
27463,Sheldon,6," Professor Hawking, how nice of you to call.",6,Big Bang Theory,44,8
27465,Sheldon,6," Oh, me, too.",6,Big Bang Theory,13,3
27467,Sheldon,6," Yes, congratulations. You won fair and square. Uh, very impressive, sir.",6,Big Bang Theory,73,11
27469,Sheldon,6," Oh, I love brain teasers.",6,Big Bang Theory,26,5
27473,Amy,7, Cut.,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
27474,Sheldon,7, What's wrong?,6,Big Bang Theory,14,2
27475,Amy,7," Sorry, Sheldon, you were brilliant as always. Wil, that was a little wooden.",6,Big Bang Theory,77,13
27477,Amy,7," Don't worry, it wasn't terrible. Just, this time, try to say it the way people sound. And action.",6,Big Bang Theory,98,18
27478,Sheldon,7," My friend, Wil Wheaton.",6,Big Bang Theory,24,4
27480,Sheldon,7," So, Wil, what do you have for us first?",6,Big Bang Theory,40,9
27482,Amy,7, Cut.,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
27484,Amy,7," It's called Fun with Flags. They're not at half-mast, nobody died. Let's try and keep it upbeat.",6,Big Bang Theory,97,17
27486,Sheldon,7," It's true. In 1982, Wil played the voice of Martin the mouse in The Secret of NIMH. You moved me.",6,Big Bang Theory,98,20
27487,Amy,7," You'll have to forgive me. This is my first time directing, I just want it to be good.",6,Big Bang Theory,87,18
27489,Amy,7," Great. So, this time let's try more real boy, less Pinocchio. And action.",6,Big Bang Theory,74,13
27491,Amy,7," Yes. And so far, we're still not getting our money's worth. Let's try it again. Everybody's having fun. And action.",6,Big Bang Theory,116,20
27492,Sheldon,7," So, Wil, what do you have for us first?",6,Big Bang Theory,40,9
27494,Amy,7, Cut.,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
27496,Sheldon,7," Oh, none that I could see. I saw a man who loved flags almost as much as I do. I got goose bumps.",6,Big Bang Theory,98,23
27497,Amy,7, He was overacting on purpose.,6,Big Bang Theory,30,5
27498,Sheldon,7, Really? He reminded me of a young William Shatner.,6,Big Bang Theory,51,9
27500,Amy,7, You gonna let him speak to me like that?,6,Big Bang Theory,41,9
27501,Sheldon,7," Well, you're my girlfriend and I don't want you to be upset. Then again, Wil Wheaton's my friend and I don't want him to be upset. Hmm, this is a sticky wicket.  What do you think?",6,Big Bang Theory,181,36
27502,Amy,7, Can I speak to you for a second?,6,Big Bang Theory,33,8
27503,Sheldon,7, I'll be right back. Feel free to play with yourself.,6,Big Bang Theory,53,10
27504,Amy,7," I don't care for your friend, he's being rude to me. You need to ask him to leave.",6,Big Bang Theory,83,18
27505,Sheldon,7," Amy, I can't just ask Wil Wheaton to leave. He's a minor celebrity. Once you explain who he is, many people recognize him.",6,Big Bang Theory,123,23
27506,Amy,7, Fine. Then maybe I should go.,6,Big Bang Theory,30,6
27507,Sheldon,7, Could you? That would solve everything. You are the best. I'll see you at dinner tonight?,6,Big Bang Theory,90,16
27508,Amy,7, You sure you wouldn't rather have dinner with your friend Wil Wheaton?,6,Big Bang Theory,71,12
27509,Sheldon,7," Come to think of it, I would! You, little lady, are on fire.",6,Big Bang Theory,61,13
27512,Howard,7, Don't take it personally. She likes doing them by herself so she can lick the plates with no one looking.,6,Big Bang Theory,106,20
27514,Howard,7," Yeah, let me just grab a couple of fresh turtlenecks.",6,Big Bang Theory,54,10
27516,Howard,7," What are you talking about? All I have here is a few sweaters, books, bank stuff, computers, mail, collectibles, medicine and my electric body groomer. Ooh, there's my plaid dickie. Oh, got this at the Goodwill store for 50 cents. Can you believe it?",6,Big Bang Theory,251,44
27518,Howard,7," You know, it's kinda late. Why don't we just spend the night here?",6,Big Bang Theory,67,13
27520,Howard,7, I know.,6,Big Bang Theory,8,2
27522,Howard,7, That's not true.,6,Big Bang Theory,17,3
27524,Howard,7, There's some underwear in the hamper.,6,Big Bang Theory,38,6
27526,Howard,7," Thank you, I only put it on the list two weeks ago. Okay, I see what you're getting at. How about this weekend I'll box up all my things and move them to our place.",6,Big Bang Theory,165,35
27528,Howard,7, The lightsabres are gonna look great in the living room.,6,Big Bang Theory,57,10
27531,Howard,7, Let go of whatever piece of food you're holding.,6,Big Bang Theory,49,9
27534,Leonard,7," Hey, look who's out after dark, like a big boy.",6,Big Bang Theory,48,10
27535,Sheldon,7, I was out raising heck with Mr. Wil Wheaton. Four hours more and we would have closed down the HomeTown Buffet.,6,Big Bang Theory,112,21
27536,Leonard,7, I thought you had plans with Amy.,6,Big Bang Theory,34,7
27537,Sheldon,7," Yeah, I did, but then Wil called Amy a pain in the A-S-S. She got huffy and left, then Wil and I headed out to dinner. That place really did remind me of my hometown. Because there we also have a HomeTown Buffet.",6,Big Bang Theory,213,43
27538,Leonard,7, Hold on. Wil and Amy had an argument?,6,Big Bang Theory,38,8
27539,Sheldon,7," Yes, quite the kerfuffle.",6,Big Bang Theory,26,4
27540,Leonard,7, Then Amy got mad and left?,6,Big Bang Theory,27,6
27541,Sheldon,7, Walked right out the door.,6,Big Bang Theory,27,5
27542,Leonard,7, And you?,6,Big Bang Theory,9,2
27543,Sheldon,7, Enjoyed a delightful dinner at a reasonable price. The manager recognized Wil and let us sit right next to the frozen yoghurt machine. Right next to it. I was closer to it than I am to you right now.,6,Big Bang Theory,200,39
27544,Leonard,7," Buddy, I think Amy might be upset.",6,Big Bang Theory,35,7
27545,Sheldon,7, Why's that?,6,Big Bang Theory,12,2
27546,Leonard,7," Because your friend was rude to her, and then you went to dinner with him.",6,Big Bang Theory,75,15
27547,Sheldon,7, You're just repeating what I said. It's like living with a lactose-intolerant parrot.,6,Big Bang Theory,86,13
27548,Leonard,7," Trust me, call her.",6,Big Bang Theory,20,4
27549,Sheldon,7," Fine. It's a shame you didn't go to dinner with us, because the buffet you're about to enjoy only serves humble pie, a dessert much less tasty than frozen yoghurt. I was this close.",6,Big Bang Theory,182,34
27550,Amy,7, What?,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
27551,Sheldon,7," You'll appreciate this. Leonard has some ridiculous notion that you're mad at me. Tell him you're not mad at me. Go ahead, set him straight.",6,Big Bang Theory,141,25
27552,Amy,7," I'm mad at you, Sheldon.",6,Big Bang Theory,25,5
27553,Sheldon,7," Hmm. Eat one of your Luna bars. Very often when women think they're angry, they're really just hungry.",6,Big Bang Theory,103,18
27554,Amy,7," I'm not hungry. Your friend insulted me, and you didn't do anything.",6,Big Bang Theory,69,12
27555,Sheldon,7," Precisely, I didn't do anything. Now does someone feel like checking her emotional math?",6,Big Bang Theory,89,14
27556,Leonard,7," Keep going, buddy, you're doing great.",6,Big Bang Theory,39,6
27557,Amy,7," Sheldon, I'm your girlfriend, and you should have taken my side. That's it. End of story. Good night.",6,Big Bang Theory,102,18
27558,Sheldon,7," Wow, Amy's mad and Leonard was right. What a weird day.",6,Big Bang Theory,56,11
27560,Penny,7," Hey. Sorry this took so long. But you used to work here, you know how it is.",6,Big Bang Theory,77,17
27562,Penny,7," No, I'm a terrible waitress, remember?",6,Big Bang Theory,39,6
27564,Howard,7," Now that you mention it, I was thinking tomorrow might not be great.",6,Big Bang Theory,69,13
27566,Howard,7," No excuse. It's just, you know, I'm Jewish, and technically, we're not supposed to drive or carry anything on the Sabbath. So this one's on God.",6,Big Bang Theory,145,26
27568,Howard,7," My religion's kinda loosey-goosey. Basically, as long as you got your schmekel clipped and don't wear a cross, you're good.",6,Big Bang Theory,124,20
27570,Howard,7, And I will.,6,Big Bang Theory,12,3
27571,Penny,7," Yeah, right.",6,Big Bang Theory,13,2
27572,Howard,7, I will. I'm obviously not going to live in my mother's house for the rest of my life. I'm not a child.,6,Big Bang Theory,103,22
27573,Penny,7, I've seen her burp you.,6,Big Bang Theory,24,5
27574,Howard,7," She did not burp me. She was patting me on the back, and I happened to burp. Don't you have other tables you should be waiting on?",6,Big Bang Theory,131,27
27575,Penny,7," Yeah, but I told you, I'm not good at my job. Bernadette, listen to me. He is never gonna leave.",6,Big Bang Theory,97,20
27577,Howard,7," All right, I've had enough of this. I'm a grown man, I have a successful career, for the love of God, I've been to space. I will move out when I'm ready, and I don't need anyone badgering me into it.",6,Big Bang Theory,200,41
27578,Penny,7," Wow, excuse me.",6,Big Bang Theory,16,3
27579,Howard,7, That was just for her benefit. I'll move tomorrow. I love you. Don't leave me.,6,Big Bang Theory,79,15
27581,Sheldon,7,  Amy.  Amy.  Angry Amy.,6,Big Bang Theory,24,4
27582,Amy,7, What?,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
27583,Sheldon,7," I've been thinking about what happened, and I hope this gift will make things better.",6,Big Bang Theory,86,15
27584,Amy,7, Star Trek DVDs? Why would I want this?,6,Big Bang Theory,39,8
27585,Sheldon,7," First of all, you're welcome. And furthermore, not being familiar with Wil Wheaton's body of work, there was no way for you to know you were being rude to a national treasure. Get ready for 130 hours of I told you so.  Fine. I'll just tell you what happens. Episode one, Encounter at Farpoint. Fade in. The new Enterprise heads out on its maiden voyage to contact the Bandi people of Deneb IV. Enter Wesley Crusher, played by my buddy  She's hooked.",6,Big Bang Theory,450,82
27587,Raj,7, Wow. An end of an era.,6,Big Bang Theory,23,6
27588,Howard,7," Boy, if these walls could talk.",6,Big Bang Theory,32,6
27589,Leonard,7," They'd say, why does he touch himself so much?",6,Big Bang Theory,47,9
27590,Howard,7, Yeah. I can't believe I'm not going to live here anymore. This has always been my bedroom. Right here is where my mom used to mark my height.,6,Big Bang Theory,142,28
27591,Leonard,7," Oh, yeah. Fifth grade. Sixth grade. Seventh grade. Eighth grade. Ninth grade.",6,Big Bang Theory,78,12
27592,Howard,7," I remember when I was five, hiding under this desk with all my Halloween candy. Had some Peanut M&M'S, went into my first anaphylactic shock and had to be rushed to the hospital. Came home, celebrated with a Snickers, went into my second anaphylactic shock.",6,Big Bang Theory,258,45
27593,Raj,7, When did you figure out you were allergic to nuts?,6,Big Bang Theory,51,10
27594,Howard,7, Sometime around the third Almond Joy.,6,Big Bang Theory,38,6
27595,Leonard,7, Okay. You want to start loading this stuff into the truck?,6,Big Bang Theory,59,11
27596,Howard,7," Yeah, I guess. Hey, would you do me a favour? Go on ahead. I just want one last moment alone in my old room.",6,Big Bang Theory,109,24
27597,Leonard,7, We're not standing outside by the U-Haul while you fondle yourself.,6,Big Bang Theory,68,11
27598,Howard,7," Fine, let's go.",6,Big Bang Theory,16,3
27600,Penny,7, Hey. What brings you in?,6,Big Bang Theory,25,5
27601,Sheldon,7," Penny, if you wouldn't mind, I'd like to have a conversation about girls.",6,Big Bang Theory,74,13
27602,Penny,7, I had a feeling we'd have a talk like this sooner or later. Are you finally getting fuzz in weird places?,6,Big Bang Theory,106,21
27603,Sheldon,7," Penny, please, I'm on the horns of a relationship dilemma. And for the record, I had a full pubis of hair by the time I was 19.",6,Big Bang Theory,128,27
27604,Penny,7," And for the record, bleugh. So what are you drinking?",6,Big Bang Theory,54,10
27605,Sheldon,7," Well, it's been a rough day. I usually go chamomile tea, but I don't think that's going to cut it.",6,Big Bang Theory,99,20
27606,Penny,7, You could have a Long Island Iced Tea.,6,Big Bang Theory,39,8
27607,Sheldon,7, Will that calm my nerves?,6,Big Bang Theory,26,5
27608,Penny,7, It's calmed the pants off me a couple of times.,6,Big Bang Theory,48,10
27609,Sheldon,7, Sold.,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
27610,Penny,7," Oh. So, the heart you got from the wizard giving you trouble?",6,Big Bang Theory,62,12
27611,Sheldon,7," The trouble isn't with me, Penny, it's with your gender. Someday, scientists will discover that second X chromosome contains nothing but nonsense and twaddle.",6,Big Bang Theory,159,24
27612,Penny,7," Yeah, Amy told me what happened. Look, just apologize. It'll warm her twaddle.",6,Big Bang Theory,79,13
27613,Sheldon,7," It's a Band-Aid at best. See, the core problem is that Amy and Wil do not like each other. Which is baffling because they're both crazy about me. And I like them, which indicates they're bright and interesting and/or were on Star Trek.",6,Big Bang Theory,236,43
27614,Penny,7," Honey, you can't make people like each other.",6,Big Bang Theory,46,8
27615,Sheldon,7," Not true. Leonard made me like you. And let me tell you, that was a hard row to hoe. Cheers, pal. Ooh. Boy, that is a treat that's hard to beat. Get the Mad Hatter on the horn, I'm having a tea party.",6,Big Bang Theory,201,43
27616,Penny,7, You might want to pace yourself.,6,Big Bang Theory,33,6
27617,Sheldon,7, I drink tea all the time. I think I know what I'm doing.,6,Big Bang Theory,57,13
27618,Penny,7," Far be it from me to criticize a man with a full pubis. Look, Sheldon, your problem is not Wil Wheaton, okay? Your problem is the way you treated Amy.",6,Big Bang Theory,151,30
27619,Sheldon,7, My problem is I'm out of tea.,6,Big Bang Theory,30,7
27620,Penny,7," Come on, someone insulted your girlfriend and you just let him do it. I thought you Texas guys stood up for your womenfolk.",6,Big Bang Theory,124,23
27621,Sheldon,7," Penny, please, I think I've evolved beyond my simple rustic upbringing.",6,Big Bang Theory,72,11
27622,Penny,7, Sorry.,6,Big Bang Theory,7,1
27623,Sheldon,7," On the other hand, that low-down polecat done wronged my woman.",6,Big Bang Theory,64,11
27624,Penny,7," Welcome to Long Island, Tex.",6,Big Bang Theory,29,5
27625,Sheldon,7," Amy deserves better. You know, when we buy the Planter's deluxe mix, she eats all the Brazil nuts so I don't have to look at them. She's a unique blend of saint and squirrel.",6,Big Bang Theory,175,34
27626,Penny,7," Yeah, that she is. Here you go.",6,Big Bang Theory,32,7
27627,Sheldon,7, I'm a callous egomaniac. She's gonna leave me.,6,Big Bang Theory,47,8
27628,Penny,7," No, she won't.",6,Big Bang Theory,15,3
27629,Sheldon,7," No, she won't. I'm great.",6,Big Bang Theory,26,5
27631,Howard,7," Okay, I have now officially moved out of my mother's house. You are now the only woman in my life who I'll see naked in the bathroom.",6,Big Bang Theory,134,27
27633,Howard,7," Oh, I'm fine. It's just her I'm worried about.",6,Big Bang Theory,47,9
27635,Howard,7," I know. It's just ever since my dad left, I've felt responsible for her.",6,Big Bang Theory,73,14
27637,Howard,7," She was just so sad all the time. I was the only person who could cheer her up. Well, me and Ben and Jerry.",6,Big Bang Theory,108,24
27639,Howard,7," You know, she's why I first got into magic. I would do little shows for her, hang up a bedsheet like it was a curtain, put on a top hat and cape. And part way through the act, I would say I needed a volunteer from the audience to be my beautiful assistant and invite her up on stage. I can still remember the way she'd smile. For a few minutes, she'd forget how lonely she was.",6,Big Bang Theory,378,77
27641,Howard,7, Where we going?,6,Big Bang Theory,16,3
27643,Howard,7," No, but I want to live here.",6,Big Bang Theory,29,7
27645,Howard,7, Can't we talk about this?,6,Big Bang Theory,26,5
27648,Sheldon,7,"  Wil Wheaton!  Wil Wheaton! Wait, how many was that?",6,Big Bang Theory,53,9
27650,Sheldon,7, Wouldn't you like to know?,6,Big Bang Theory,27,5
27652,Sheldon,7, Just tea. S'the best tea I've ever had.,6,Big Bang Theory,40,8
27654,Sheldon,7, I'll tell you. I'm from Texas. Need I say more?,6,Big Bang Theory,48,10
27656,Sheldon,7, You insulted my woman. I'm here to defend her honour. Two! It was two.  Wil Wheaton! Now prepare yourself for what may come.,6,Big Bang Theory,125,23
27658,Sheldon,7, My fists are not up here because I'm milking a giant invisible cow. They're up to beat an apology out of you.,6,Big Bang Theory,110,22
27660,Sheldon,7," Well, that was a long bus ride for not very much.",6,Big Bang Theory,50,11
27662,Sheldon,7," You're asking a lot of questions, Wil Wheaton. As a matter of idle curiosity, which of your shrubberies do you feel would benefit from a thorough vomiting? Never mind, I'll choose.  You were so good in Stand by Me.",6,Big Bang Theory,215,39
27664,Sheldon,7," Hello, I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. Get ready for a very special episode where we explore the flags of the popular entertainment franchise, Star Trek. And to help us, I'm pleased to introduce a special guest, surprisingly, it only took gas money and the promise of free food to get him here, Mr. LeVar Burton.",6,Big Bang Theory,356,62
27666,Amy,7," Cut. Yikes, this guy is worse than Wil Wheaton.",6,Big Bang Theory,48,9
27667,Sheldon,7," I don't know what she's talking about, but I'm obligated to agree with her. She's my girlfriend.",6,Big Bang Theory,97,17
27670,Raj,8, What are you drawing over there?,6,Big Bang Theory,33,6
27671,Sheldon,8, It's a hypothetical containment field for a Frisbee-sized wormhole that could serve as a portal to a parallel universe.,6,Big Bang Theory,120,19
27672,Howard,8," Oh, you silly doodlebug.",6,Big Bang Theory,25,4
27673,Leonard,8," You know, a lot of scientists believe that making contact with other life-forms would probably not end well for us.",6,Big Bang Theory,116,20
27674,Sheldon,8," It's a Frisbee-sized wormhole, Leonard. You can block it with a Frisbee. Calm down. ",6,Big Bang Theory,85,14
27675,Howard,8, Do you expect me to build this?,6,Big Bang Theory,32,7
27676,Sheldon,8, I expect you to wipe the pudding off your chin. Gentlemen.,6,Big Bang Theory,59,11
27677,Howard,8, Have you guys ever noticed that Sheldon always disappears every day at two forty-five?,6,Big Bang Theory,87,14
27678,Leonard,8, Really?,6,Big Bang Theory,8,1
27679,Raj,8, He probably just goes to the bathroom.,6,Big Bang Theory,39,7
27680,Leonard,8," Actually, no, he goes to the bathroom at eight a.m. with optional follow-ups at one forty-five and seven ten high-fibre Fridays.",6,Big Bang Theory,129,21
27681,Raj,8, It's sad that you know that.,6,Big Bang Theory,29,6
27682,Leonard,8," Oh, that's just the tip of the sadness iceberg.",6,Big Bang Theory,48,9
27683,Howard,8," I'm looking at his public calendar. Two forty-five to three-oh-five, nothing. Yesterday, two forty-five to three-oh-five, nothing, last week, nothing, last month, nothing. He never has anything booked during that time.",6,Big Bang Theory,219,31
27684,Raj,8," Twenty minutes a day, completely unaccounted for.",6,Big Bang Theory,50,7
27685,Howard,8, We should figure out where he goes.,6,Big Bang Theory,36,7
27686,Raj,8," Ooh, this is exciting. Like one of my classic murder mystery dinner parties.",6,Big Bang Theory,77,13
27687,Leonard,8," Right, the case of who murdered three Saturday nights of my life?",6,Big Bang Theory,66,12
27688,Howard,8, Colonel Koothrapali in the kitchen with the olive spread.,6,Big Bang Theory,58,9
27689,Raj,8, It was tapenade and you guys suck.,6,Big Bang Theory,35,7
27691,Penny,8," So, how was work today?",6,Big Bang Theory,24,5
27692,Leonard,8," Well, I spent most of the afternoon growing isotopically pure crystals for neutrino detection.",6,Big Bang Theory,95,14
27693,Penny,8, That sounds like fun.,6,Big Bang Theory,22,4
27694,Leonard,8," Yeah, it was.",6,Big Bang Theory,14,3
27695,Penny,8," Oh, good, I guessed right.",6,Big Bang Theory,27,5
27696,Leonard,8, Who you talking to?,6,Big Bang Theory,20,4
27697,Penny,8," Oh, just this guy I met at school.",6,Big Bang Theory,35,8
27698,Leonard,8," Oh, great. We're still dating, right?",6,Big Bang Theory,38,6
27699,Penny,8, Relax. He's just a friend. We're doing an oral report together. He's really nice.,6,Big Bang Theory,82,14
27700,Leonard,8," I'm sorry, what was that? I had a little stroke after oral.",6,Big Bang Theory,60,12
27701,Penny,8," Would you stop? Look, he just moved here from London, okay? He doesn't really know anybody.",6,Big Bang Theory,92,16
27702,Leonard,8," Oh, good, an English accent, the sexiest accent you can have.",6,Big Bang Theory,62,11
27703,Penny,8," No. That's not true. There's French, there's Italian. No, you're right, it's the best.",6,Big Bang Theory,87,14
27704,Leonard,8, Did you tell him you have a boyfriend?,6,Big Bang Theory,39,8
27705,Penny,8, It didn't come up.,6,Big Bang Theory,19,4
27706,Leonard,8," Well, maybe you should tell him.",6,Big Bang Theory,33,6
27707,Penny,8, What am I supposed to say?,6,Big Bang Theory,27,6
27708,Leonard,8," Say, can't talk right now, hanging with my boyfriend. England sucks, you suck, USA number one.",6,Big Bang Theory,95,16
27709,Penny,8, Fine. Hanging with my boyfriend. Talk to you later. Happy?,6,Big Bang Theory,59,10
27710,Leonard,8, Yes. Thank you.,6,Big Bang Theory,16,3
27711,Penny,8, Mm-hmm. Hmm.,6,Big Bang Theory,13,2
27712,Leonard,8, What did he say?,6,Big Bang Theory,17,4
27713,Penny,8, Nothing.,6,Big Bang Theory,9,1
27714,Leonard,8, What?,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
27715,Penny,8, Did your boyfriend make you type that?,6,Big Bang Theory,39,7
27716,Leonard,8, I hate this guy.,6,Big Bang Theory,17,4
27717,Penny,8, Don't be like that.,6,Big Bang Theory,20,4
27718,Leonard,8," Come on, trust me, he's hitting on you.",6,Big Bang Theory,40,8
27719,Penny,8," No, he's not. We're just friends. Look, is this gonna be a problem? Because he's supposed to come over tomorrow to work.",6,Big Bang Theory,121,22
27720,Leonard,8, Really? Here?,6,Big Bang Theory,14,2
27721,Penny,8," If it makes you uncomfortable, I'll switch partners, even though the thing's due next week and everyone already has a partner and I'll probably end up failing the class.",6,Big Bang Theory,170,29
27722,Leonard,8, That'd be great. Thank you.,6,Big Bang Theory,28,5
27724,Howard,8," Two forty-four, Right on schedule. Hey, Sheldon.",6,Big Bang Theory,49,7
27725,Sheldon,8," Oh, hello.",6,Big Bang Theory,11,2
27726,Howard,8, Raj and I are heading over to the genetics lab to pet the glow-in-the-dark bunny. Want to come with us?,6,Big Bang Theory,104,20
27727,Sheldon,8," No, thank you.",6,Big Bang Theory,15,3
27728,Raj,8," Are you sure? They turn off the lights, and it's like a cute little laser show that poops all over the place.",6,Big Bang Theory,110,22
27729,Sheldon,8, I'm quite sure. Good day.,6,Big Bang Theory,26,5
27730,Howard,8," Well, where are you going?",6,Big Bang Theory,27,5
27731,Sheldon,8, Where are you going?,6,Big Bang Theory,21,4
27732,Raj,8, We just told you.,6,Big Bang Theory,18,4
27733,Sheldon,8, I just told you.,6,Big Bang Theory,17,4
27734,Howard,8," No, you didn't.",6,Big Bang Theory,16,3
27735,Sheldon,8," Well, it's your word against mine; see you in court.",6,Big Bang Theory,53,10
27736,Howard,8, Should we follow him?,6,Big Bang Theory,22,4
27737,Raj,8," I don't know, I'm torn. I want to know where he's going, but now I kind of want to play with the bunny.",6,Big Bang Theory,104,23
27739,Howard,8," Hey, Alex, do you know where your boss just went?",6,Big Bang Theory,50,10
27741,Howard,8, Don't you know his schedule?,6,Big Bang Theory,29,5
27743,Howard,8, Come on.,6,Big Bang Theory,9,2
27744,Raj,8," Boy, what I wouldn't give to get her out of those pants and into something a little more stylish.",6,Big Bang Theory,98,19
27746,Howard,8, This is where he goes? What's in there?,6,Big Bang Theory,40,8
27747,Raj,8, I think it's an old storage room.,6,Big Bang Theory,34,7
27748,Howard,8, What could he be doing in there every day for twenty minutes?,6,Big Bang Theory,62,12
27749,Raj,8," Well, he's not doing twenty-minute abs, because if he were, he would have way better abs. Can you hear anything?",6,Big Bang Theory,113,20
27750,Howard,8, Not yet. What are you doing?,6,Big Bang Theory,29,6
27751,Raj,8, I'm listening.,6,Big Bang Theory,15,2
27752,Howard,8, Can't you face the other way and listen?,6,Big Bang Theory,41,8
27753,Raj,8," I can't do anything right for you, can I?",6,Big Bang Theory,42,9
27754,Howard,8, What the hell is he up to?,6,Big Bang Theory,27,7
27755,Raj,8, He is kind of a weirdo. Maybe he's got Leonard Nimoy chained up in there. Or Bill Gates. Or Stephen Hawking.,6,Big Bang Theory,109,21
27756,Howard,8, Why would he chain up Stephen Hawking?,6,Big Bang Theory,39,7
27757,Raj,8," Howard, please, you can't treat the man differently just because he's disabled. That's not okay.",6,Big Bang Theory,97,15
27759,Leonard,8," If you're wondering why I've been staring through the peephole, I'm trying to get a look at this guy who's coming over to Penny's.",6,Big Bang Theory,131,24
27760,Sheldon,8," To be honest, I didn't know you were here.",6,Big Bang Theory,43,9
27761,Leonard,8," It's not a big deal. He's just in her history class. They're working on a project together. I don't even know why I care. You know what, I don't care.",6,Big Bang Theory,151,30
27762,Sheldon,8, You think you don't care?,6,Big Bang Theory,26,5
27763,Leonard,8, This is silly. I have nothing to worry about.,6,Big Bang Theory,46,9
27764,Sheldon,8," Oh, I don't know. I mean, statistically speaking, I'm sure you have something to worry about.",6,Big Bang Theory,94,16
27765,Leonard,8, What do you mean?,6,Big Bang Theory,18,4
27766,Sheldon,8," Well, if we assume your looks are average, yeah, right off the bat, fifty percent of men on Earth are more attractive than you. That's one point five billion handsome lads standing by, waiting to rain on your parade.",6,Big Bang Theory,217,39
27767,Leonard,8," Well, yeah, but this isn't just about looks. I'm, I'm way above average in a lot of other things.",6,Big Bang Theory,98,19
27768,Sheldon,8," Not height, vision, athleticism, or ability to digest dairy products.",6,Big Bang Theory,70,10
27769,Leonard,8, I'm talking about important things like emotional maturity.,6,Big Bang Theory,60,8
27770,Sheldon,8, You were just spying on your girlfriend through a peephole.,6,Big Bang Theory,60,10
27771,Leonard,8, I liked it better when you thought I wasn't here.,6,Big Bang Theory,50,10
27772,Sheldon,8," I'm not saying you don't have attractive qualities. Your choice of friends is impeccable, you're a good sleeper, and last but not least, you buy the grapes I like. You're a real catch compared to some snoring guy with a fridge full of lousy grapes.",6,Big Bang Theory,249,45
27773,Leonard,8," None of this matters. I trust that Penny cares about me, and nothing's gonna happen with this guy.",6,Big Bang Theory,99,18
27774,Sheldon,8," Well, unless of course he's a skilled hypnotist.",6,Big Bang Theory,49,8
27775,Leonard,8, What?,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
27776,Sheldon,8," While unlikely, it's still a statistical possibility. She might be performing sexual acts with him and not even know it.",6,Big Bang Theory,121,20
27777,Leonard,8, Now you're just being ridiculous.,6,Big Bang Theory,34,5
27778,Sheldon,8," Am I? The mind's a mysterious thing, Leonard. He could be having the time of his life while she thinks she's a chicken pecking for corn.",6,Big Bang Theory,137,26
27780,Raj,8," Look at us, sneaking around in the middle of the night like a couple of cat burglars.",6,Big Bang Theory,86,17
27781,Howard,8, I think we're more like ninjas.,6,Big Bang Theory,32,6
27782,Raj,8," I don't want to be a ninja, I want to be a cat burglar.",6,Big Bang Theory,56,14
27783,Howard,8," Fine, I'll be a ninja, you be a cat burglar.",6,Big Bang Theory,45,10
27784,Raj,8," No, we both have to be the same thing. Okay, we're ninjas.",6,Big Bang Theory,59,12
27785,Howard,8, Thank you.,6,Big Bang Theory,11,2
27786,Raj,8," But next time, we'll be cat burglars.",6,Big Bang Theory,38,7
27787,Howard,8, It's locked.,6,Big Bang Theory,13,2
27788,Raj,8, Are you sure?,6,Big Bang Theory,14,3
27789,Howard,8," Yes, I'm sure. Now, you stand guard, I'm going to",6,Big Bang Theory,50,10
27790,Raj,8, It's locked.,6,Big Bang Theory,13,2
27791,Howard,8, Just keep an eye out. I'll have this open in a minute.,6,Big Bang Theory,55,12
27792,Raj,8, When did you learn how to pick locks?,6,Big Bang Theory,38,8
27793,Howard,8," When I was starting to do magic in junior high, I thought I could be an escape artist like Harry Houdini.",6,Big Bang Theory,106,21
27794,Raj,8, How did that work out?,6,Big Bang Theory,23,5
27795,Howard,8," Pretty good. I managed to escape friends, popularity, and every party thrown in a twelve mile radius. There. Ready?",6,Big Bang Theory,116,19
27796,Raj,8," Hold on, hold on.",6,Big Bang Theory,18,4
27797,Howard,8, What?,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
27798,Raj,8," Sheldon is a very smart man, and he obviously wants to keep this a secret.",6,Big Bang Theory,75,15
27799,Howard,8," Yeah, so?",6,Big Bang Theory,10,2
27800,Raj,8, What if it's booby-trapped?,6,Big Bang Theory,28,4
27801,Howard,8," Don't worry, I'm one step ahead of him.",6,Big Bang Theory,40,8
27802,Raj,8," Great, what's your pl ",6,Big Bang Theory,23,4
27803,Howard,8, Are we good?,6,Big Bang Theory,13,3
27804,Raj,8, Yeah. Huh. Forty-three? What the hell does that mean?,6,Big Bang Theory,54,9
27805,Howard,8, I don't know. The solution to an equation?,6,Big Bang Theory,43,8
27806,Raj,8, Maybe. It's a prime number. Encryption systems are built on prime numbers.,6,Big Bang Theory,75,12
27807,Howard,8, What kind of secret does Sheldon have to encrypt?,6,Big Bang Theory,50,9
27808,Raj,8, He's always been very cagey about what he puts in his egg salad to make it so tasty.,6,Big Bang Theory,85,18
27809,Howard,8, It's paprika.,6,Big Bang Theory,14,2
27810,Raj,8," Really? Well, oh, okay, one mystery solved.",6,Big Bang Theory,44,7
27813,Penny,8," Thanks, Cole. See you at school.",6,Big Bang Theory,33,6
27815,Leonard,8, I'll be right back.,6,Big Bang Theory,20,4
27816,Sheldon,8, I thought you left a long time ago.,6,Big Bang Theory,36,8
27817,Leonard,8, â€˜sup?,6,Big Bang Theory,8,1
27819,Leonard,8," You, uh, moving into the apartment on the fifth floor?",6,Big Bang Theory,55,10
27821,Leonard,8," Oh, cool. That cute blonde on four?",6,Big Bang Theory,36,7
27823,Leonard,8," I, well, I see her around. I like to keep my distance because her boyfriend is a pretty scary dude.",6,Big Bang Theory,100,20
27825,Leonard,8, Yeah. He's ganged up.,6,Big Bang Theory,22,4
27827,Leonard,8, That's the name of his gang. The Scientists. They are crazy.,6,Big Bang Theory,61,11
27829,Leonard,8," No problem, brother. Stay frosty.  We're still dating, right?",6,Big Bang Theory,62,9
27832,Leonard,8," Hey, Alex, and call me Leonard. Dr. Hofstadter is my father. And my mother. And my sister. And our cat. Although, I'm pretty sure Dr. Boots Hofstadter's degree was honorary.",6,Big Bang Theory,174,30
27834,Leonard,8, Sure.,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
27836,Leonard,8," Hey, Alex, let me ask you something. My girlfriend knows this guy at school. He's got an English accent.",6,Big Bang Theory,105,19
27838,Leonard,8," Yeah, you all do. Anyway, I feel like he's hitting on her. She says he's just being nice and that I should trust her.",6,Big Bang Theory,118,24
27840,Leonard,8," Right. Because girls are always like, ooh, that guy owns two Star Trek uniforms and gets a lot of ear infections. I got to get me some of that.",6,Big Bang Theory,144,29
27842,Leonard,8," Trust me, it doesn't.",6,Big Bang Theory,22,4
27844,Leonard,8, Really?,6,Big Bang Theory,8,1
27846,Leonard,8," Okay, I got to get back to work. Thanks for listening.",6,Big Bang Theory,55,11
27848,Leonard,8, Hope-hope no girls rip my clothes off on the way.,6,Big Bang Theory,50,10
27850,Raj,8," Come on, we're smart guys. We can figure this out.",6,Big Bang Theory,51,10
27851,Howard,8, Forty-three. What is forty-three? Besides my mom's neck size.,6,Big Bang Theory,62,9
27852,Raj,8, It's the atomic number for technetium.,6,Big Bang Theory,39,6
27853,Howard,8, That stuff's radioactive.,6,Big Bang Theory,26,3
27854,Raj,8, Do you think he's building a bomb?,6,Big Bang Theory,35,7
27855,Howard,8," Ah, it took him two years to put together that Lego Death Star, I'm not worried.",6,Big Bang Theory,81,16
27856,Raj,8," Ooh, this could be something. forty-three is the number of calories in half a cup of fat-free yoghurt.",6,Big Bang Theory,103,18
27857,Howard,8, Why would you know that?,6,Big Bang Theory,25,5
27858,Raj,8," I'm sorry. We can't all eat whatever we want and still stay thin. Wait, in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, isn't forty-three the answer to the question of life, the universe,and everything?",6,Big Bang Theory,196,33
27859,Howard,8," That's forty-two, dumb-ass.",6,Big Bang Theory,28,3
27860,Raj,8," Hey, hey. Feelings.",6,Big Bang Theory,20,3
27861,Howard,8, We should stop. I'm exhausted.,6,Big Bang Theory,31,5
27862,Raj,8," Yeah, me, too. We've got more important things to do. Who cares what stupid forty-three means?",6,Big Bang Theory,95,16
27863,Howard,8, Not me.,6,Big Bang Theory,8,2
27864,Raj,8, Let's go home. You want to get something to eat?,6,Big Bang Theory,49,10
27865,Howard,8, Sounds good.,6,Big Bang Theory,13,2
27866,Raj,8, What the balls is forty-three?,6,Big Bang Theory,31,5
27867,Howard,8, I have to know!,6,Big Bang Theory,16,4
27869,Leonard,8, Hi.,6,Big Bang Theory,4,1
27870,Penny,8," Hey, shouldn't you be out with your gang, spray painting equations on the side of buildings?",6,Big Bang Theory,93,16
27871,Leonard,8," Come on, I'm sorry.",6,Big Bang Theory,20,4
27872,Penny,8, I just can't believe you don't trust me.,6,Big Bang Theory,41,8
27873,Leonard,8," I do, of course I do.",6,Big Bang Theory,22,6
27874,Penny,8," Then why did you embarrass me in front of my friend, who, by the way, knew exactly who you were?",6,Big Bang Theory,97,20
27875,Leonard,8, Really?,6,Big Bang Theory,8,1
27876,Penny,8, Your picture's on my refrigerator.,6,Big Bang Theory,35,5
27877,Leonard,8," Oh. You know, I'm really starting to not like this guy.",6,Big Bang Theory,56,11
27878,Penny,8, What is your problem? Do you use up all your thinking at work and then have none left over for when you get home?,6,Big Bang Theory,114,24
27879,Leonard,8," I don't know. It-it-it's hard sometimes. Everywhere you go, guys hit on you, even if I'm standing right there. And they're all taller than me. Why is everyone taller than me? You know what, this is all in my head. It's my problem, not yours.",6,Big Bang Theory,242,45
27880,Penny,8," Leonard, why do you always do this? Listen to me, you're the one I'm with. You know I love you, so will you please relax because you're driving me crazy.",6,Big Bang Theory,154,30
27881,Leonard,8, You know that's the first time you ever said that you love me.,6,Big Bang Theory,63,13
27882,Penny,8, Yeah.,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
27883,Leonard,8, We're just supposed to pretend it's not a big deal?,6,Big Bang Theory,52,10
27884,Penny,8," That's exactly what we're gonna do because you're about to make me cry, and we both know if I start crying, you're gonna start crying.",6,Big Bang Theory,135,25
27885,Leonard,8," You're right, you should go.",6,Big Bang Theory,29,5
27886,Penny,8, All right.,6,Big Bang Theory,11,2
27887,Leonard,8," She loves me.  Hey, it's Alex. Nice having coffee with you. If you want to talk more, I'm always available. Smiley face, smiley face. What a friendly girl.",6,Big Bang Theory,156,28
27889,Howard,8," Okay, picture's up. Looks like the camera's working.",6,Big Bang Theory,53,8
27890,Raj,8, That's good quality video.,6,Big Bang Theory,27,4
27891,Howard,8, It better be. It's the spare camera for the Mars rover.,6,Big Bang Theory,56,11
27892,Raj,8, How did you get your hands on that?,6,Big Bang Theory,36,8
27893,Howard,8," Million dollar camera, ten dollar lock.",6,Big Bang Theory,40,6
27894,Raj,8," Oh, my God, here he comes. This is it.",6,Big Bang Theory,39,9
27895,Howard,8, What the hell is that thing?,6,Big Bang Theory,29,6
27896,Raj,8, I don't know.,6,Big Bang Theory,14,3
27897,Sheldon,8, This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Experimental log. Wormhole generator test forty-four.,6,Big Bang Theory,82,11
27898,Howard,8, Wormhole generator test? ,6,Big Bang Theory,26,3
27899,Sheldon,8, The first forty-three parallel universes I've checked proved to be empty. I see no reason to suspect universe number forty-four will be any different. ,6,Big Bang Theory,152,24
27900,Howard,8," Oh, my God!",6,Big Bang Theory,12,3
27901,Raj,8, Holy crap!,6,Big Bang Theory,11,2
27902,Sheldon,8, Oh! It's eating my face!,6,Big Bang Theory,25,5
27903,Raj,8, Aah! It's eating his face!,6,Big Bang Theory,27,5
27904,Sheldon,8, I found your webcam and replaced the video feed. You two should be ashamed of yourselves.,6,Big Bang Theory,90,16
27905,Raj,8," Sheldon, we're really sorry.",6,Big Bang Theory,29,4
27906,Howard,8," Yeah, really sorry.",6,Big Bang Theory,20,3
27907,Sheldon,8," Sorry? You may not realize it, but I have difficulty navigating certain aspects of daily life. You know, understanding sarcasm, feigning interest in others, not talking about trains as much as I want to. It's exhausting. Which is why, for twenty minutes a day, I like to go down to that room, turn my mind off and do what I need to do to recharge.",6,Big Bang Theory,348,65
27908,Howard,8, But what are you doing in there?,6,Big Bang Theory,33,7
27909,Raj,8, And what does forty-three mean?,6,Big Bang Theory,32,5
27910,Sheldon,8," You don't need to know, you don't deserve to know, and you will never know.",6,Big Bang Theory,76,15
27911,Raj,8," Yeah, well, I know how to make your egg salad now.",6,Big Bang Theory,51,11
27913,Sheldon,8," One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight Drat. I'm never going to get to forty-three again. One, two, three, four Rats.",6,Big Bang Theory,126,22
27915,Leonard,9, They are not.,6,Big Bang Theory,14,3
27916,Raj,9," They are, too.",6,Big Bang Theory,15,3
27917,Leonard,9, Your hypothesis is completely disconfirmed by all the data. You're just clinging to it out of intellectual stubbornness.,6,Big Bang Theory,121,18
27918,Raj,9," No, you're displaying a shocking ignorance of the subject matter. Mummies and zombies are the exact same thing.",6,Big Bang Theory,112,18
27919,Leonard,9," Oh, yeah? Mummies are wrapped in bandages.",6,Big Bang Theory,43,7
27920,Raj,9, That's called a fashion choice.,6,Big Bang Theory,32,5
27921,Leonard,9," All right, you brought this on yourself. Sheldon, get him.",6,Big Bang Theory,59,10
27922,Sheldon,9," If a zombie bites you, you turn into a zombie. However, if a mummy bites you, all you turn into is some schmo with a mummy bite. So, like a zombie, that's been eaten from the waist down, you, sir, have no leg to stand on.",6,Big Bang Theory,222,46
27923,Leonard,9, Good boy. Here's a cookie.,6,Big Bang Theory,27,5
27924,Sheldon,9," Oh, thank you.",6,Big Bang Theory,15,3
27925,Howard,9," Hey, fellas, what's going on?",6,Big Bang Theory,30,5
27926,Leonard,9," Oh, mummies and zombies again.",6,Big Bang Theory,31,5
27927,Howard,9," Oh, they're not the same thing.",6,Big Bang Theory,32,6
27928,Leonard,9," You get a cookie, too.",6,Big Bang Theory,23,5
27929,Howard,9, Thanks. Guess who picked up his new car this morning?,6,Big Bang Theory,54,10
27930,Raj,9, Congratulations. Does it have that new car smell?,6,Big Bang Theory,50,8
27931,Howard,9," Yep. For as long as I can keep my mother out of it. If you want to check it out later, it's parked right out front, space 294.",6,Big Bang Theory,127,28
27932,Sheldon,9," I'm sorry, 294?",6,Big Bang Theory,16,3
27933,Howard,9, Yeah.,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
27934,Sheldon,9, That's my parking spot.,6,Big Bang Theory,24,4
27935,Raj,9, Why do you have a parking spot? You don't have a car. You don't even drive.,6,Big Bang Theory,76,16
27936,Sheldon,9, It doesn't matter. That's my spot.,6,Big Bang Theory,35,6
27937,Leonard,9, Maybe they reassigned it because you never use it.,6,Big Bang Theory,51,9
27938,Sheldon,9," Well, I'm not using my nipples, either. Maybe they should reassign those.",6,Big Bang Theory,74,12
27939,Howard,9," Sheldon, someday, if you get a car, I'm sure they'll give you another parking space.",6,Big Bang Theory,85,15
27940,Sheldon,9," I don't want another parking space. I want my parking space. It's perfect. It's a corner spot, cutting the risk of door-dings in half. It's a mere 28 steps from the building entrance. The nearby tree provides shade on hot days and is also home to a delightful squirrel. Which is fortuitous because most squirrels are real jerks.",6,Big Bang Theory,329,58
27941,Howard,9," Fun story. Meanwhile, you still don't have a car.",6,Big Bang Theory,50,9
27942,Sheldon,9, Don't try to change the subject. This is about a parking space. It has nothing to do with cars.,6,Big Bang Theory,96,19
27943,Howard,9, Are you listening to yourself?,6,Big Bang Theory,31,5
27944,Sheldon,9," I always listen to myself. It's one of the great joys of my life. Now, get your car out of my spot.",6,Big Bang Theory,100,22
27945,Howard,9, Nope.,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
27946,Sheldon,9, Very well. You leave me no choice.,6,Big Bang Theory,35,7
27948,Sheldon,9," What are you looking at, you stupid squirrel?",6,Big Bang Theory,46,8
27950,Sheldon,9," President Siebert, listen to reason. Yeah, I understand I don't use the parking spot, but that's not the point. I Yes, I'm aware you told me not to call you at home, but you didn't answer the door. And I know you were there, because I saw you through the mail slot. Yeah, well, that's some salty language. May I remind you that you're the president of a major university, not the president of the Potty Mouth Club. There it is again. Do you kiss your mother with that mouth? Oh, well, I'm sorry for your loss. Good night, sir. Unbelievable. He says Wolowitz deserves my spot because he's a high-profile asset to the university.",6,Big Bang Theory,628,115
27951,Leonard,9," Well, he's not wrong. Howard did go to the International Space Station.",6,Big Bang Theory,72,12
27952,Sheldon,9," Yeah, that was five weeks ago. How much longer is he gonna milk that cow?",6,Big Bang Theory,74,15
27953,Leonard,9," Sheldon, let it go. It's not a big deal.",6,Big Bang Theory,41,9
27954,Sheldon,9," No, no, this is a slippery slope, Leonard. It starts with a parking space, where does it end? It's like my dad always said, first they say you can't drink and drive, next thing you know, you can't let your 10-year-old take the wheel while you sleep one off in the backseat.",6,Big Bang Theory,274,52
27955,Leonard,9, All that story does is make me feel bad for your mother.,6,Big Bang Theory,57,12
27956,Sheldon,9," Leonard, you're my best friend. Why don't you ever take my side?",6,Big Bang Theory,65,12
27957,Leonard,9, Because I can never understand your side.,6,Big Bang Theory,42,7
27959,Howard,9, Give it back.,6,Big Bang Theory,14,3
27960,Sheldon,9," I'm sorry, but could you be more specific?",6,Big Bang Theory,43,8
27961,Howard,9, My Iron Man helmet. Koothrappali saw you take it. Give it back.,6,Big Bang Theory,64,12
27962,Sheldon,9," Oh, that. Well, see, I wanted it, and you weren't using it. Apparently, those are the rules we live by now. Payback, it truly is the B word, isn't it?",6,Big Bang Theory,151,30
27963,Howard,9," Sheldon, that is a five hundred dollar limited edition collectible, and I want it back.",6,Big Bang Theory,88,15
27964,Sheldon,9," I'd love to help you out, but unfortunately , I'm using it.",6,Big Bang Theory,60,12
27965,Howard,9, Fine. I'm taking your diploma.,6,Big Bang Theory,31,5
27966,Sheldon,9, Go ahead. That's the only doctorate you'll ever get. It smells funny in here.,6,Big Bang Theory,78,14
27969,Penny,9," Yeah. So, how you doing?",6,Big Bang Theory,25,5
27970,Amy,9," A little sensitive, but not bad. Does it always take that long?",6,Big Bang Theory,64,12
27971,Penny,9," Uh, no, they usually don't have to go out and get more wax.",6,Big Bang Theory,60,13
27972,Amy,9, I feel like I'm five pounds lighter.,6,Big Bang Theory,37,7
27974,Penny,9," Hey, anybody want a drink?",6,Big Bang Theory,27,5
27975,Amy,9, Sure.,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
27977,Amy,9," For hours. Fortunately, I couldn't understand most of it 'cause Sheldon was wearing that stupid robot mask.",6,Big Bang Theory,108,17
27979,Amy,9," I guess this is what we get for being with two testosterone-fueled alpha males. At some point, they're bound to lock horns.",6,Big Bang Theory,124,22
27980,Penny,9, I'm assuming these are some kind of horns they bought at Comic-Con?,6,Big Bang Theory,68,12
27982,Amy,9," I know, Sheldon should just let Howard have his little moment in the sun.",6,Big Bang Theory,74,14
27984,Amy,9," Well, I mean, Howard's never gonna go to space again, but Sheldon will always be a genius.",6,Big Bang Theory,91,17
27986,Amy,9, If and when?,6,Big Bang Theory,13,3
27987,Penny,9," Okay, maybe we should change the subject. Um, Amy, how are your lady parts? Still chilly down there?",6,Big Bang Theory,101,18
27989,Amy,9, That's an impressive accomplishment. He's now an inspiration to millions of Americans who know you don't have to be special or even qualified to go into space.,6,Big Bang Theory,160,27
27990,Penny,9," You know, I remember the first time I got a bikini wax. My sister did it with melted Crayolas and duct tape. It's a bad idea.",6,Big Bang Theory,126,26
27992,Penny,9, Damn.,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
27993,Amy,9," Yeah, well, at least when we do make love, Sheldon won't be thinking about his mother. And yes, that is a cleverly veiled reference to Howard's lifelong obsession to crawl back into her spacious womb.",6,Big Bang Theory,201,35
27994,Penny,9," Anyway, to this day, I still can't see a box of crayons without crossing my legs.",6,Big Bang Theory,82,16
27997,Leonard,9, Sheldon?,6,Big Bang Theory,9,1
27998,Sheldon,9, Cookie.,6,Big Bang Theory,8,1
27999,Leonard,9, I don't have any.,6,Big Bang Theory,18,4
28000,Sheldon,9," Well, I'm not giving it away. ",6,Big Bang Theory,31,6
28001,Howard,9, Hi Sheldon.,6,Big Bang Theory,12,2
28002,Sheldon,9," He's in my spot. Leonard, make him stop being naked in my spot.",6,Big Bang Theory,64,13
28003,Leonard,9," Howard, what are you doing?",6,Big Bang Theory,28,5
28004,Howard,9, He wasn't using it. And I needed a nice cool piece of leather to wiggle my naked ass on.,6,Big Bang Theory,89,19
28005,Sheldon,9, Get off there.,6,Big Bang Theory,15,3
28006,Howard,9, Give me back my Iron Man helmet.,6,Big Bang Theory,33,7
28007,Sheldon,9, Give me back my parking space.,6,Big Bang Theory,31,6
28008,Howard,9, You don't need a parking space. You don't have a car.,6,Big Bang Theory,54,11
28009,Sheldon,9, You don't need an Iron Man helmet. You're not Iron Man.,6,Big Bang Theory,56,11
28010,Howard,9," Well, we appear to have reached an impasse. And you know, I have to say, I thought you'd be more upset that your laptop is sitting on my junk.",6,Big Bang Theory,143,29
28011,Raj,9, I didn't pick up on that. That's a nice touch.,6,Big Bang Theory,47,10
28012,Leonard,9, Mmm.,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
28014,Amy,9, This is so exciting. I'm feeling all tingly. Although that could just be my newly defoliated bikini zone.,6,Big Bang Theory,106,18
28015,Sheldon,9, Keep a lookout. This place is swarming with campus security. They will not hesitate to scold us.,6,Big Bang Theory,97,17
28016,Amy,9, Freaking pigs.,6,Big Bang Theory,15,2
28017,Sheldon,9," Oh, yeah. Okay, now, pull your car into the spot and let's get out of here.",6,Big Bang Theory,76,16
28018,Amy,9," Wait, I'm leaving my car here?",6,Big Bang Theory,31,6
28019,Sheldon,9," Yes, and be sure and put on the emergency brake. Really makes these things tough to budge.",6,Big Bang Theory,91,17
28020,Amy,9," Before I park, come in the back seat. I want to show you something I had done today.",6,Big Bang Theory,85,18
28021,Sheldon,9," All right, colour me intrigued.",6,Big Bang Theory,32,5
28022,Amy,9, What do you think?,6,Big Bang Theory,19,4
28023,Sheldon,9," I think you're high on paint fumes. And boy, that's a lot of Band-Aids.",6,Big Bang Theory,72,14
28025,Penny,9," Okay, Howard's mother is in, like, every one of your wedding photos.",6,Big Bang Theory,69,12
28027,Penny,9," No, Leonard's taking me to a physics lecture, and coffee'll just keep me awake.  Oh, I'll get it.",6,Big Bang Theory,98,18
28028,Amy,9," Oh, looks like someone's on Team Bernadette. Where's Howard?",6,Big Bang Theory,61,9
28030,Amy,9, He had my car towed. It cost me two hundred dollars to get it back.,6,Big Bang Theory,68,15
28032,Amy,9, In Sheldon's spot.,6,Big Bang Theory,19,3
28034,Amy,9," Don't play dumb with me, sister. You tell your husband he owes me two hundred dollars.",6,Big Bang Theory,87,16
28036,Amy,9, Why not?,6,Big Bang Theory,9,2
28038,Amy,9, You?,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
28040,Amy,9," Oh, yeah? Well, you're not gonna see this coming. ",6,Big Bang Theory,51,9
28041,Penny,9, Ow! Ow!,6,Big Bang Theory,8,2
28042,Amy,9," Oh, my God,",6,Big Bang Theory,12,3
28044,Penny,9," You idiot, what the hell do you have in there?!",6,Big Bang Theory,48,10
28045,Amy,9," Just my wallet, keys and a coffee can full of change I've been meaning to take to the bank.",6,Big Bang Theory,92,19
28047,Amy,9, Are you okay?,6,Big Bang Theory,14,3
28048,Penny,9, Get away from me or I swear to God I will rip out what's left of your pubes!,6,Big Bang Theory,77,18
28050,Penny,9, Thanks. Ah!,6,Big Bang Theory,12,2
28052,Penny,9," Gee, you think?",6,Big Bang Theory,16,3
28053,Amy,9," I do. Penny, Bernadette and I are sorry.",6,Big Bang Theory,41,8
28055,Amy,9, You had my car towed.,6,Big Bang Theory,22,5
28057,Amy,9, I was parked in Sheldon's spot.,6,Big Bang Theory,32,6
28059,Penny,9," Guys, I think I need to go to the emergency room.",6,Big Bang Theory,50,11
28061,Amy,9, I'll drive. You can see where the tow truck scratched my car.,6,Big Bang Theory,62,12
28063,Amy,9, How do you know?,6,Big Bang Theory,17,4
28066,Sheldon,9," Morning, Professor Stevens. Don't look at that whiteboard. That's my math, not your math. Keep walking, nosey.",6,Big Bang Theory,111,17
28067,Howard,9, What the hell are you doing?,6,Big Bang Theory,29,6
28068,Sheldon,9," Oh. You said I'm not using my space, so I'm using it.",6,Big Bang Theory,54,12
28069,Howard,9," Okay, you need to move now.",6,Big Bang Theory,28,6
28070,Sheldon,9," No, I don't.",6,Big Bang Theory,13,3
28071,Howard,9, You can't stay there forever.,6,Big Bang Theory,30,5
28072,Sheldon,9," Actually, I have a plastic baggy strapped to my leg that says I can. Give up, Wolowitz. You've chosen to tangle with a superior intellect you can't defeat. There is nothing you could possibly do to ",6,Big Bang Theory,199,36
28073,Howard,9," Those aren't gonna help you, Sheldon,",6,Big Bang Theory,38,6
28074,Sheldon,9," Oh, yes, they are. I mean, what?",6,Big Bang Theory,33,7
28075,Howard,9," I'm warning you, Sheldon!",6,Big Bang Theory,26,4
28076,Sheldon,9," Your threats are empty, nothing can move me.  Stop that.",6,Big Bang Theory,57,10
28077,Howard,9, Get out of my spot.,6,Big Bang Theory,20,5
28078,Sheldon,9, No. That's it. I am calling campus security. You prepare for the scolding of your life.,6,Big Bang Theory,88,16
28079,Leonard,9, What are you idiots doing?,6,Big Bang Theory,27,5
28080,Sheldon,9," He's trying to kill me, Leonard. Video games and rock music have desensitized him to violence.",6,Big Bang Theory,95,16
28081,Howard,9, Would you please talk some sense into your lunatic roommate?,6,Big Bang Theory,61,10
28082,Leonard,9, You're both acting like lunatics. It's just a parking spot.,6,Big Bang Theory,60,10
28083,Howard,9, It's not just a parking spot. He can't handle the fact that I'm a bigger deal than he is now.,6,Big Bang Theory,94,20
28084,Sheldon,9," Oh, preposterous. I have been solely responsible for this university's six loop quantum gravity calculations, I have changed the way we think about Bose-Einstein condensates, and I am also the one who got Nutter Butters in the cafeteria vending machine. Maybe you missed that news while you were floating around like a goof in outer space. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have work to do.",6,Big Bang Theory,385,66
28085,Howard,9, Can you believe this guy?,6,Big Bang Theory,26,5
28086,Leonard,9, What I don't believe is that you tried to run him over.,6,Big Bang Theory,56,12
28087,Howard,9," Oh, like you've never thought of doing that. Don't hate me just because I lived the dream.  ",6,Big Bang Theory,93,17
28088,Sheldon,9," Hey, sweet ride.",6,Big Bang Theory,17,3
28089,Howard,9, What are you doing in there?,6,Big Bang Theory,29,6
28090,Sheldon,9, Just breaking in your new car.,6,Big Bang Theory,31,6
28091,Howard,9, Stop that. You stop that.,6,Big Bang Theory,26,5
28092,Sheldon,9, You know what they say? Revenge is a dish best served nude.,6,Big Bang Theory,60,12
28094,Raj,9," Hey, got a minute?",6,Big Bang Theory,19,4
28095,Sheldon,9," Oh, of course, come in.  This is an authentic Chinese throwing star, and I must warn you, I have seen many people throw them in movies.",6,Big Bang Theory,136,26
28096,Raj,9, Calm down. Howard has something he wants to say to you.,6,Big Bang Theory,56,11
28097,Howard,9," All right. Sheldon, when this whole thing with the parking space started, I had no idea just how much of a crazy bastard",6,Big Bang Theory,121,23
28098,Raj,9," Howard, that's not how we practiced it.",6,Big Bang Theory,40,7
28099,Howard,9," I had no idea how much that spot meant to you. Anyway, I called President Siebert and told him it's not worth fighting over the spot, so you keep it, and I'll park in the structure across the street.",6,Big Bang Theory,200,39
28100,Sheldon,9," Well, Howard, thank you. It's quite a gesture on your part. You've shown yourself to be the bigger man.",6,Big Bang Theory,104,19
28101,Howard,9, Thank you.,6,Big Bang Theory,11,2
28102,Sheldon,9," Which I find totally unacceptable. I must be the bigger man. Therefore, you may use my spot until such time as I learn to drive or get a Batmobile.",6,Big Bang Theory,148,29
28103,Howard,9," Wow, okay. Well, thanks. I don't know what to say.",6,Big Bang Theory,51,10
28104,Sheldon,9, There is nothing to say. Except I'm the bigger man. I'm not kidding. Say it.,6,Big Bang Theory,77,15
28105,Raj,9, Just say it.,6,Big Bang Theory,13,3
28106,Howard,9," You're the bigger man, Sheldon.",6,Big Bang Theory,32,5
28107,Sheldon,9," Oh, stop. And I believe this is yours. FYI, if you wear that into a bank, they will tackle you to the ground.",6,Big Bang Theory,110,23
28109,Howard,9," I'd like to propose a toast, to burying the hatchet.",6,Big Bang Theory,53,10
28110,Sheldon,9, To burying the hatchet.,6,Big Bang Theory,24,4
28112,Amy,9," Me, too. In some weird way, I kind of feel like it brought us closer.",6,Big Bang Theory,70,15
28113,Penny,9," Yeah, everybody's happy, great.",6,Big Bang Theory,32,4
28116,Sheldon,9," Yes. According to information I gleaned from Yelp, you had great success when a santeriasuzy37 brought you a pair of leather slacks stained with chicken blood. I believe I may have a similar problem. This cushion experienced a nude revenge wiggle.",6,Big Bang Theory,248,41
28118,Sheldon,9," A naked man sat on it. Now, here's my concern, his diet is rich in fatty deli meats. What test do you have to detect lipid residue?",6,Big Bang Theory,132,27
28120,Sheldon,9," Lipid residue. An anal autograph. A colon calling card, if you will.",6,Big Bang Theory,69,12
28122,Sheldon,9, Don't rush it. We may be dealing with befoulment on a molecular level.,6,Big Bang Theory,71,13
28124,Sheldon,9, Is that your son?,6,Big Bang Theory,18,4
28126,Sheldon,9," Looks like that laptop's seen better days. If you're interested, I'm selling this. It's only two years old, 16 gigabytes of RAM, Intel core i7 processor, and I can personally guarantee it has spent less than 20 minutes resting on an astronaut's penis.",6,Big Bang Theory,252,43
28128,Sheldon,10, Is anyone else troubled by the Spider-Man theme song?,6,Big Bang Theory,54,9
28129,Leonard,10," Why would it trouble you? It's, like, your third favourite cartoon theme song.",6,Big Bang Theory,79,13
28130,Sheldon,10," It is, right behind do-do-do-do-do Inspector Gadget., and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, heroes in a half-shell.",6,Big Bang Theory,112,16
28132,Sheldon,10," However, the Spider-Man lyrics posit that Spider-Man, Spider-Man does whatever a spider can.",6,Big Bang Theory,93,13
28133,Howard,10," Yeah, so?",6,Big Bang Theory,10,2
28134,Sheldon,10," I can think of many things Spider-Man can't do that a spider can. One, crawl in your ear and die. Two, legally leave Guatemala without a passport. Three, have sex with a spider.",6,Big Bang Theory,178,33
28135,Raj,10, an we change the subject? Spiders give me the jeebie-jeebies.,6,Big Bang Theory,62,10
28136,Howard,10, It's heebie-jeebies.,6,Big Bang Theory,21,2
28137,Raj,10," I know, but that sounds anti-Semitic. Anyway, I was thinking we could have a little film festival tonight. The theme, movies that killed their franchises.",6,Big Bang Theory,155,25
28138,Leonard,10," Oh. Like Jaws 4, Indiana Jones 4, Daredevil 1.",6,Big Bang Theory,47,9
28139,Leonard,10," Penny's working tonight, I'm in.",6,Big Bang Theory,33,5
28140,Howard,10, Not me. I'm having dinner with Bernadette and her parents.,6,Big Bang Theory,59,10
28141,Leonard,10, Fun. We know how much you love that.,6,Big Bang Theory,37,8
28142,Howard,10, It's torture. Especially with her dad. We have nothing in common.,6,Big Bang Theory,66,11
28143,Sheldon,10," You know what I like to do when I'm forced to speak with those beneath my intellectual station? I bring up an interesting topic, like the difference between Spider-Man and spiders.",6,Big Bang Theory,181,31
28144,Howard,10," Thanks, Sheldon. I'll try that with my father-in-law.",6,Big Bang Theory,54,8
28145,Sheldon,10," No, you can't use that one. That's mine. Uh, try this one for an ice-breaker. Uh, despite popular lore, there is no place in the continental United States, Alaska or Hawaii from which one can dig straight through the centre of the earth and come up in China.",6,Big Bang Theory,259,48
28146,Howard,10," Great, thank you.",6,Big Bang Theory,18,3
28147,Sheldon,10," Actually, you can't have that one either. It's too good. Sorry.",6,Big Bang Theory,64,11
28148,Raj,10," What about you, Sheldon? Do you have any plans tonight?",6,Big Bang Theory,56,10
28149,Sheldon,10," Sadly, yes. Amy's taking me to a memorial service. It's for one of her colleagues who is of Asian descent, so my planned conversational gambit is to casually remark that no matter how deep they dig his grave, he'll never make his way back to China.",6,Big Bang Theory,249,46
28150,Leonard,10, That should lighten the mood.,6,Big Bang Theory,30,5
28151,Sheldon,10, What can I say? I put the fun in funeral.,6,Big Bang Theory,42,10
28153,Sheldon,10,"  Amy.  Amy. Oh, right, funeral.   Amy.",6,Big Bang Theory,39,6
28154,Amy,10," Hello, Sheldon.",6,Big Bang Theory,16,2
28155,Sheldon,10," I'm not allowed to wear my Silver Surfer neck tie, but you can wear a bathrobe?",6,Big Bang Theory,80,16
28156,Amy,10, I think I'm too sick to go to the funeral.,6,Big Bang Theory,43,10
28157,Sheldon,10," You're sick? You poor kid. Well, see ya.",6,Big Bang Theory,41,8
28158,Amy,10," Sheldon, aren't you gonna take care of me?",6,Big Bang Theory,43,8
28159,Sheldon,10," Me? No. No, I'm not that kind of doctor.",6,Big Bang Theory,41,9
28160,Amy,10," But our relationship agreement clearly states that when one of us is sick, the other must take care of them.",6,Big Bang Theory,109,20
28161,Sheldon,10," Oh, no, I see the confusion. No, the intent behind that clause was to force you to take care of me when I'm ill. When you're feeling better, you'll think that's funny.",6,Big Bang Theory,168,32
28162,Amy,10," Never mind. Good night, Sheldon.",6,Big Bang Theory,33,5
28163,Sheldon,10,"  Amy.  Amy.  Amy. I made a commitment in writing to comfort you in times like this. Additionally, you are my girlfriend, and I care about your well-being.",6,Big Bang Theory,155,27
28164,Amy,10," Thank you, Sheldon.",6,Big Bang Theory,20,3
28165,Sheldon,10, You're welcome. Now let's get this over with.,6,Big Bang Theory,46,8
28167,Howard,10," So, how have you been?",6,Big Bang Theory,23,5
28169,Howard,10, Good. Fine is good. How you liking retirement?,6,Big Bang Theory,47,8
28171,Howard,10, I'm sensing a theme. You ever really think about the Spider-Man theme song? How's that dinner coming?,6,Big Bang Theory,102,17
28173,Howard,10, I like rare chicken. Let's do this.,6,Big Bang Theory,36,7
28175,Howard,10, Death by chicken. That's a pretty fowl way to go.,6,Big Bang Theory,50,10
28178,Howard,10," So, Mrs. Rostenkowski, you took that trip to the Grand Canyon. How was it?",6,Big Bang Theory,75,14
28180,Howard,10, Had no idea you were the chatty one.,6,Big Bang Theory,37,8
28182,Sheldon,10, 102.2. Exactly what it was half an hour ago. It's like you're not even trying to get better.,6,Big Bang Theory,93,18
28183,Amy,10," Sheldon, you don't get over the flu in half an hour.",6,Big Bang Theory,53,11
28184,Sheldon,10," Well, not with that attitude.",6,Big Bang Theory,30,5
28185,Amy,10," I have to say, I'm finding your bedside manner a little lacking.",6,Big Bang Theory,65,12
28186,Sheldon,10," I'm sorry. I just want you to get better as soon as possible. And with that goal in mind, let me ask you a question. Do you believe in the placebo effect?",6,Big Bang Theory,155,32
28187,Amy,10, Of course I do. There have been many studies proving its validity.,6,Big Bang Theory,67,12
28188,Sheldon,10," Great. Now, this may look like a Tic Tac, but it is really a powerful medication specifically designed to cure your illness as well as freshen your breath.",6,Big Bang Theory,156,28
28189,Amy,10," Sheldon, this isn't helping. Why don't you just let me get some rest.",6,Big Bang Theory,70,13
28190,Sheldon,10," How can you sleep? I'm not done making you feel better. I still have to put a cold rag on your head, sing to you and apply VapoRub to your chest.",6,Big Bang Theory,146,31
28191,Amy,10," You, you want to rub something on my chest?",6,Big Bang Theory,44,9
28192,Sheldon,10, Yes. All over it.,6,Big Bang Theory,18,4
28193,Amy,10, Maybe we should start with that.,6,Big Bang Theory,33,6
28194,Sheldon,10," Now you're being a responsible patient. Now, you may notice some tingling.",6,Big Bang Theory,75,12
28195,Amy,10," Oh, I'm counting on it.",6,Big Bang Theory,24,5
28197,Howard,10," Okay, dig in.",6,Big Bang Theory,14,3
28199,Howard,10, Took the words right out of my mouth.,6,Big Bang Theory,38,8
28202,Howard,10," Oh, you like to fish?",6,Big Bang Theory,22,5
28204,Howard,10, Sure. I can hear it in your voice.,6,Big Bang Theory,35,8
28206,Howard,10," You know, I hadn't thought of that.  Help me.",6,Big Bang Theory,46,9
28208,Howard,10," No, no. We know each other well enough. He's been talking my ear off all night.",6,Big Bang Theory,80,16
28212,Howard,10," Well, hang on a second, Bernie. Next weekend, we have that thing.",6,Big Bang Theory,66,12
28214,Howard,10," You know, the thing.",6,Big Bang Theory,21,4
28217,Howard,10, Great.  Thanks for the help.,6,Big Bang Theory,29,5
28219,Howard,10, I've never even been fishing. This is gonna be a disaster.,6,Big Bang Theory,59,11
28220,Raj,10," If you don't want to look foolish doing something, you should practice. Do you know how many Beef Wellingtons I made by myself before I invited you guys over? I'll give you a hint. You can see them here, here and here.",6,Big Bang Theory,219,42
28221,Leonard,10, Raj is probably right. You should get someone to give you some pointers.,6,Big Bang Theory,73,13
28222,Howard,10, Do either of you guys know how to fish?,6,Big Bang Theory,40,9
28223,Leonard,10, No.,6,Big Bang Theory,4,1
28224,Raj,10," No. But if you catch anything, I know how to steam it in banana leaves.",6,Big Bang Theory,72,15
28225,Howard,10," Come on, we must know somebody who can do manly stuff like this.",6,Big Bang Theory,65,13
28227,Penny,10, S'up?,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
28229,Penny,10," Step one, worms.",6,Big Bang Theory,17,3
28230,Howard,10, Ew!,6,Big Bang Theory,4,1
28231,Penny,10," Okay, right there, ew is one of the things you're not gonna want to say in front of your father-in-law. It's right up there with icky and get it away. Now pick one up.",6,Big Bang Theory,168,34
28232,Howard,10, Really?,6,Big Bang Theory,8,1
28233,Penny,10, You're gonna have to do it when you're fishing.,6,Big Bang Theory,48,9
28234,Howard,10, Okay.,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
28235,Penny,10, What are you waiting for?,6,Big Bang Theory,26,5
28236,Howard,10," I don't know, for them to die of natural causes.",6,Big Bang Theory,49,10
28237,Penny,10, Just pick up a worm and put him on this hook.,6,Big Bang Theory,46,11
28238,Howard,10, Fine. There.,6,Big Bang Theory,13,2
28239,Leonard,10," I'm no expert, but I think the hook has to go through the worm.",6,Big Bang Theory,64,14
28240,Howard,10," Fine. Sorry, Mr. Worm. Sherm. Sherm the Worm.",6,Big Bang Theory,46,8
28241,Penny,10," Hey, don't name him. Just jab a hook in his face.",6,Big Bang Theory,50,11
28242,Raj,10," You got this, buddy.",6,Big Bang Theory,21,4
28243,Leonard,10," Yeah, come on, Howard. Hook that worm.",6,Big Bang Theory,39,7
28244,Raj,10, You can do it.,6,Big Bang Theory,15,4
28245,Penny,10," That's great. Cheerleading, way to man things up.",6,Big Bang Theory,50,8
28247,Sheldon,10," And the control group displayed significantly fewer genetic abnormalities. But, because of flaws in the experimental design relating to environment and diet, they lived inconclusively ever after. The end.",6,Big Bang Theory,205,29
28248,Amy,10, That was great. Rub my chest again.  ,6,Big Bang Theory,38,7
28249,Sheldon,10," No. I need to get you down for a nap. And for some reason, that VapoRub gets you all fired up. ",6,Big Bang Theory,96,21
28251,Sheldon,10," Oh, I'm hanging in there. Thanks for asking.",6,Big Bang Theory,45,8
28253,Sheldon,10," Uh, I'm going to draw you a soothing bath. Where's your bath thermometer?",6,Big Bang Theory,74,13
28254,Amy,10, I don't have a bath thermometer.,6,Big Bang Theory,33,6
28255,Sheldon,10, Fine. Then I'm going to draw you a nerve-wracking bath of indeterminate temperature.,6,Big Bang Theory,85,13
28257,Amy,10," Okay, okay, here's the deal. I don't need your medicine. I'm not sick.",6,Big Bang Theory,71,13
28259,Amy,10, I got better two days ago. It's just been so nice having Sheldon take care of me.,6,Big Bang Theory,82,17
28261,Amy,10, See the stuff in my nose? Rubber cement.,6,Big Bang Theory,41,8
28263,Amy,10, All right. I'll tell him.,6,Big Bang Theory,26,5
28264,Sheldon,10," Amy, would you be strong enough to bathe yourself, or do you need my help?",6,Big Bang Theory,75,15
28265,Amy,10, I'll tell him tomorrow. Mama needs a bath.,6,Big Bang Theory,43,8
28267,Penny,10," Now, let's assume, by some miracle, you actually catch a fish. You're going to have to know how to gut it. So, what you're going to do is you're going to take your knife, slice him right up the belly.  You want me to stop?",6,Big Bang Theory,223,45
28268,Howard,10," No, I'm fine. Keep going.",6,Big Bang Theory,26,5
28269,Penny,10," All right. Now, you don't want to cut too deep into its guts, or the blood will just squirt all over your face.  Oh, my God. What is with you guys?",6,Big Bang Theory,148,31
28270,Leonard,10, It's not our fault. Our dads never did anything like this with us.,6,Big Bang Theory,67,13
28271,Penny,10," What, never?",6,Big Bang Theory,13,2
28272,Leonard,10," My dad was an anthropologist. The only father-son time he spent was with a 2,000-year-old skeleton of an Etruscan boy. I hated that kid.",6,Big Bang Theory,137,24
28273,Raj,10," Mine just took me to his gynecology office. I got so bored, I'd put vaginal lubricant on the bottom of my shoes and pretend I was ice-skating.",6,Big Bang Theory,143,27
28274,Howard,10," Yeah, well, my quality father-son time was spending my adolescence looking out the window waiting for my dad to come back someday.",6,Big Bang Theory,131,22
28275,Raj,10," Yeah, okay, Howard wins.",6,Big Bang Theory,25,4
28276,Leonard,10," You know, maybe we didn't have opportunities like this when we were growing up, but right now, there's a dad that wants to take you on a fishing trip.",6,Big Bang Theory,151,29
28277,Howard,10, You're right. Oh! I should do this.,6,Big Bang Theory,36,7
28278,Penny,10," Great. Here you go. What you're going to do is you're going to stick your thumb down its throat, grab the guts and pull.",6,Big Bang Theory,121,24
28279,Howard,10, Here we go. Oh!,6,Big Bang Theory,16,4
28280,Penny,10," Oh, look, it's a female. You can see all the eggs. ",6,Big Bang Theory,52,11
28282,Amy,10," Oh, Sheldon, am I glad you're back. Taking a turn for the worst. I think I'm going to need another bath.",6,Big Bang Theory,105,21
28283,Sheldon,10," I'm surprised to hear that. See, the other day, I was concerned that you weren't recovering, so while you were sleeping, I took a cheek swab and had it cultured in the lab.",6,Big Bang Theory,173,33
28284,Amy,10, Oh?,6,Big Bang Theory,4,1
28285,Sheldon,10," I got the results back. Have you developed any of the following symptoms? A growing nose, or perhaps a warm sensation in the trouser region? Also known as full-blown liar, liar, pants on fire.",6,Big Bang Theory,193,34
28286,Amy,10," All right, all right. But I really was sick at the beginning. It's just been so nice having you take care of me.",6,Big Bang Theory,113,23
28287,Sheldon,10," It hurts that you would lie to me, Amy. I thought our relationship was based on trust and a mutual admiration that skews in my favour.",6,Big Bang Theory,135,26
28288,Amy,10, I feel terrible I did this.,6,Big Bang Theory,28,6
28289,Sheldon,10," It pains me to say it, but I think some form of penalty is in order, so as to discourage this type of behaviour in the future.",6,Big Bang Theory,127,27
28290,Amy,10, I suppose that's fair. What do you suggest?,6,Big Bang Theory,44,8
28291,Sheldon,10," In a perfect world, I'd lock you in a stockade in the public square. That probably requires a permit.",6,Big Bang Theory,102,19
28292,Amy,10, I could not be allowed to go to the opening of the next Star Trek movie.,6,Big Bang Theory,73,16
28293,Sheldon,10," Oh, that seems overly harsh. I mean, you gave in to a human weakness, you didn't kill a man. You know, it's a tad old-school, but my father was not one to spare the rod when my brother would sneak into his truck and drink his driving whiskey.",6,Big Bang Theory,243,48
28294,Amy,10, Are you saying you want to spank me?,6,Big Bang Theory,37,8
28295,Sheldon,10, I don't want to. But it looks like you left me no choice.,6,Big Bang Theory,58,13
28296,Amy,10, That's true. I've been a very bad girl.,6,Big Bang Theory,40,8
28298,Howard,10," Hi-ho, hi-ho, it's off to fish we go.",6,Big Bang Theory,38,8
28300,Howard,10, No good? The guy at the sporting goods store said these are what fishermen wear.,6,Big Bang Theory,81,15
28302,Howard,10, Wish I had known that before I posted all those pictures on Facebook.,6,Big Bang Theory,70,13
28304,Howard,10," Wait, now we're shooting things?",6,Big Bang Theory,33,5
28306,Howard,10," Sir, I'm flattered that you invited me, and I really want you to like me, but I don't think this trip is the way to do it. And I can't return these things if there's chunks of duck all over them.",6,Big Bang Theory,196,41
28308,Howard,10, â€˜Cause Bernadette made me.,6,Big Bang Theory,29,4
28310,Howard,10," Really? Your wife makes you do stuff? You're a big, scary cop.",6,Big Bang Theory,63,12
28312,Howard,10," So, what do we do now? They expect us to go away for the weekend.",6,Big Bang Theory,66,15
28314,Howard,10," No, but I'm not a stranger to dice games. I was the Temple Beth-El Hebrew School Yahtzee champion.",6,Big Bang Theory,99,18
28316,Howard,10," Really? Thank you, sir.",6,Big Bang Theory,24,4
28318,Howard,10," Okay. Oh, boy, we're just married to a couple of ballbusters, huh, Mike?",6,Big Bang Theory,73,13
28320,Howard,10, Great couple of gals.,6,Big Bang Theory,22,4
28323,Sheldon,10, Are you prepared to receive your punishment?,6,Big Bang Theory,45,7
28324,Amy,10, One second. I want to put on some music.,6,Big Bang Theory,41,9
28325,Sheldon,10, Why?,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
28326,Amy,10, I don't want to disturb the people next door while you discipline me.,6,Big Bang Theory,70,13
28327,Sheldon,10," Very well, then. Get over my knee. Let's begin.",6,Big Bang Theory,48,9
28328,Amy,10," Oh, my.",6,Big Bang Theory,8,2
28329,Sheldon,10, Excuse me. You're not supposed to be enjoying this.,6,Big Bang Theory,52,9
28330,Amy,10, Then maybe you should spank me harder.,6,Big Bang Theory,39,7
28331,Sheldon,10, Maybe I will.,6,Big Bang Theory,14,3
28332,Amy,10, Ooh!,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
28334,Penny,11," Okay, now holding sides of hearth in position, lower mantelpiece assembly onto top tabs.",6,Big Bang Theory,89,14
28335,Leonard,11," Look at that, I built a fireplace with my own two hands.",6,Big Bang Theory,57,12
28336,Penny,11, You're so butch.,6,Big Bang Theory,17,3
28337,Leonard,11," Aw, I got a little paper cut.",6,Big Bang Theory,30,7
28338,Penny,11, Of course you did. Your hands are softer than veal.,6,Big Bang Theory,52,10
28339,Leonard,11," Oh, before I forget, Saturday I'm planning a little Dungeons and Dragons night with the guys.",6,Big Bang Theory,94,16
28340,Penny,11, Really? That's how you're gonna spend your Saturday night?,6,Big Bang Theory,59,9
28341,Leonard,11," Oh, come on, I hardly ever get a chance to play anymore.",6,Big Bang Theory,57,12
28342,Penny,11," Oh, you poor thing. Is having a real-life girlfriend who has sex with you getting in the way of your board games?",6,Big Bang Theory,114,22
28343,Leonard,11," Little bit, yeah.",6,Big Bang Theory,18,3
28345,Amy,11," Oh, great! I've always wanted to play Dungeons and Dragons.",6,Big Bang Theory,60,10
28346,Sheldon,11," Yeah, oh, I'm sorry. I should've mentioned this earlier. You're not invited.",6,Big Bang Theory,77,12
28347,Amy,11, Why not?,6,Big Bang Theory,9,2
28348,Sheldon,11," Amy, from time to time, we men need to break free from the shackles of civility and get in touch with our primal animalistic selves.",6,Big Bang Theory,133,25
28349,Amy,11, By rolling dice and playing make-believe with little figurines?,6,Big Bang Theory,64,9
28350,Sheldon,11," Yeah, like a bunch of savages.",6,Big Bang Theory,31,6
28353,Howard,11," But I have to go. We play as a group. If-if I'm not there, then everyone will blame you. They'll be all, Bernadette ruined everything. She's the worst. So, you see? I have to play Dungeons and Dragons for the marriage.",6,Big Bang Theory,219,41
28355,Howard,11, I'm your idiot. Forever.,6,Big Bang Theory,25,4
28357,Raj,11," So, listen, I know we talked about getting a bite to eat in Silver Lake, and then seeing the Christmas lights in Griffith Park, but Leonard's talking about a big D and D game at his place.",6,Big Bang Theory,189,37
28360,Leonard,11," All right, Sheldon, to start our quest you need to open this little Christmas gift I got you.",6,Big Bang Theory,94,18
28361,Sheldon,11, A Christmas gift? You know I don't enjoy Christmas.,6,Big Bang Theory,52,9
28363,Sheldon,11," Oh, where to begin? Trees indoors. Overuse of the words 'tis and 'twas. And the absurd custom of one stocking. Everyone knows socks belong in pairs. Who uses one sock?",6,Big Bang Theory,168,30
28364,Howard,11,Pirate with a peg leg?,6,Big Bang Theory,22,5
28365,Sheldon,11," Actually that helps, thank you.",6,Big Bang Theory,32,5
28366,Leonard,11, Would you just look inside?,6,Big Bang Theory,28,5
28367,Sheldon,11," Oh, a scroll. I like scrolls. They're my third favourite system of transmitting the written word. After stone tablets and skywriting. You have all been summoned to join a thrilling Dungeons and Dragons adventure. Your quest begins in a secret northern village of elves who have all been massacred. I like where this is heading. Your task is to rescue their leader from a dungeon of ogres. Oh, that's a saucy twist. That leader's name, Santa Claus. No, no, no.",6,Big Bang Theory,460,80
28368,Leonard,11," It's actually ho, ho, ho, but you'll get the hang of it. Thought it'd be fun to make a quest with a holiday theme.",6,Big Bang Theory,115,24
28369,Sheldon,11," Fun? Mixing Dungeons and Dragons with Christmas is like making a sandwich of grape jelly, the best-tasting jelly, and petroleum jelly, the worst-tasting jelly.",6,Big Bang Theory,160,24
28370,Leonard,11," Okay, here we go. You find yourselves in the smoking remains of Santa's village. Clearly, a great battle has taken place.",6,Big Bang Theory,122,21
28371,Raj,11," Oh, man, the first monster I see, I'm gonna sneak up behind him, whip out my wand, and shoot my magic all over his ass.",6,Big Bang Theory,120,25
28373,Leonard,11," Okay, there are ogre tracks and a trail of broken candy canes in the snow. Sheldon, what do you do?",6,Big Bang Theory,100,20
28374,Sheldon,11, I signal my contempt for your cruel plan to shove Christmas joy down my throat by making a gesture that says get a load of this guy.,6,Big Bang Theory,133,27
28375,Leonard,11," Fine. Howard, what do you do?",6,Big Bang Theory,30,6
28376,Howard,11," I follow the ogre tracks, checking for secret doors along the way.",6,Big Bang Theory,67,12
28377,Leonard,11, And you discover a secret door leading to a dark corridor.,6,Big Bang Theory,59,11
28378,Howard,11," Okay, guys, let's make a plan, spell casters in the back, warriors in the front.",6,Big Bang Theory,81,15
28379,Raj,11," No, screw that noise, I'm going in. Hang on, Santa, I'm coming for you.",6,Big Bang Theory,72,14
28380,Leonard,11," Okay, you run into a room full of weapons, hit a trip wire, a cannon blows your face off, you die, you're out of the game.",6,Big Bang Theory,123,26
28381,Raj,11," But, a cannon? Am I really out of the game?",6,Big Bang Theory,44,10
28382,Sheldon,11, Lucky.,6,Big Bang Theory,7,1
28383,Leonard,11," Okay, come on, moving on.",6,Big Bang Theory,26,5
28384,Raj,11," Wait, doesn't anyone have a rod of resurrection? Because if you've got one, I need it bad. Get in here with your rod and give it to me.",6,Big Bang Theory,136,28
28386,Penny,11," Hey, guys. I don't mean to interrupt your little game, but I thought you'd like to see what you're missing out on. So, Bernadette? Bernadette's wearing leopard-print pumps and a rack-tastic red dress from Forever 21. And there's Amy, showing all kinds of ankle. In an outfit I'm assuming is from Forever 63. And I, myself am wearing a little number that got me out of two speeding tickets and jury duty.",6,Big Bang Theory,404,72
28387,Sheldon,11," I know they're making a rhetorical point, I just don't know what it is.",6,Big Bang Theory,72,14
28388,Penny,11," See you, boys. We are going drinking.",6,Big Bang Theory,38,7
28389,Raj,11," Uh, wait, can I come with you? My character died.",6,Big Bang Theory,50,10
28391,Amy,11, Maybe another time.,6,Big Bang Theory,20,3
28392,Leonard,11, Okay,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
28393,Penny,11, Come on.,6,Big Bang Theory,9,2
28394,Raj,11," Ooh! Girls' night, girls' night! Ooh! Ooh!",6,Big Bang Theory,43,7
28397,Amy,11," So, what's the plan? Are we gonna teach our fellas a lesson by getting stinking drunk, luring strange men into the bathroom, and turning the toilet stall into a temple of the senses?",6,Big Bang Theory,183,33
28399,Penny,11, No!,6,Big Bang Theory,4,1
28400,Amy,11," Geez, who's Forever 63 now?",6,Big Bang Theory,28,5
28401,Raj,11, Can we get another bottle of champagne for the table? Don't worry. It's my treat.,6,Big Bang Theory,82,15
28402,Amy,11, Thanks.,6,Big Bang Theory,8,1
28403,Penny,11," Wow, you should come to girls' night more often. And not just because if you weren't here, this would be a can of Pabst.",6,Big Bang Theory,121,24
28404,Raj,11," My pleasure, nothing makes me happier than the chance to spoil a lady. Just ask my dog. My vet says if I give her any more foie gras, she's going to die of gout.",6,Big Bang Theory,162,34
28406,Raj,11," No, no, no, I'm fine.",6,Big Bang Theory,22,5
28407,Penny,11," Okay, wait, are we talking one-night stand or do we want to get him into a relationship?",6,Big Bang Theory,89,17
28408,Amy,11, Let's get him laid!,6,Big Bang Theory,20,4
28409,Raj,11, Stop it. You're ruining girls' night.,6,Big Bang Theory,38,6
28410,Penny,11," Raj, you're a great guy, you're in a bar full of single women, let us help you.",6,Big Bang Theory,80,17
28412,Raj,11, That's sweet of you. But what can you do to help?,6,Big Bang Theory,50,11
28414,Raj,11," Okay. Well, a couple of things. Don't tell them I come from money. I want them to love me for me. They must be insanely hot. Like, nines or tens.",6,Big Bang Theory,146,30
28415,Penny,11, Nines or tens?,6,Big Bang Theory,15,3
28416,Raj,11," Okay, an eight is acceptable if she's willing to bring another eight to the hot tub.",6,Big Bang Theory,85,16
28418,Raj,11, In a New Delhi minute.,6,Big Bang Theory,23,5
28421,Leonard,11," Oh, uh, yeah. I got 'em on Amazon.",6,Big Bang Theory,35,8
28423,Leonard,11," I know, but when I shop online, I can do it on the toilet.",6,Big Bang Theory,59,14
28425,Howard,11, Can we please move this along?,6,Big Bang Theory,31,6
28426,Leonard,11," Yeah, sorry. Uh, you come to the end of the tunnel and find a large chest. What do you do? And, Howard, do not say, I feel up the large chest.",6,Big Bang Theory,143,31
28427,Howard,11," Excuse me, I'm a married man now. I wasn't going to say anything so juvenile.",6,Big Bang Theory,78,15
28428,Leonard,11, Great. What do you do?,6,Big Bang Theory,23,5
28429,Howard,11," I walk up to the large chest, bury my face in it and go â€œblublublublublublublubluâ€ù",6,Big Bang Theory,87,15
28430,Sheldon,11, I open the chest.,6,Big Bang Theory,18,4
28431,Leonard,11," It's locked, but suddenly the door behind you slams shut and now the walls of the room start closing in.",6,Big Bang Theory,105,20
28433,Leonard,11," Glowing letters appear on the chest that read, If squashed to death you wish not to be, sing of Svaty Vaclav and his victory.",6,Big Bang Theory,126,24
28434,Howard,11, Who the hell is Svaty Vaclav?,6,Big Bang Theory,30,6
28435,Leonard,11, Walls are getting closer.,6,Big Bang Theory,26,4
28437,Sheldon,11," Wait, Svaty Vaclav was the Duke of Bohemia.",6,Big Bang Theory,44,8
28438,Leonard,11," You're ten seconds away from getting crushed. Nine, eight.",6,Big Bang Theory,59,9
28439,Howard,11, What are we supposed to do?,6,Big Bang Theory,28,6
28440,Leonard,11," Seven, six.",6,Big Bang Theory,12,2
28441,Sheldon,11," Wait, wait. Svaty Vaclav is better known as Good King Wenceslas from the beloved Victorian Christmas carol.",6,Big Bang Theory,108,17
28442,Howard,11, Never heard of it. Must be the one Christmas song not written by a Jewish guy.,6,Big Bang Theory,79,16
28443,Leonard,11," Three, two.",6,Big Bang Theory,12,2
28445,Sheldon,11," Good King Wenceslas looked out, on the feast of Stephen. When the snow lay 'round about, deep and crisp and even",6,Big Bang Theory,113,21
28446,Leonard,11, The walls are getting slower.,6,Big Bang Theory,30,5
28447,Sheldon,11," Brightly shone the moon that night, though the frost was cruel. When a poor man came in sight gathering winter fuel.",6,Big Bang Theory,117,21
28448,Leonard,11,The walls stop. You're safe.,6,Big Bang Theory,28,5
28449,Howard,11," That was amazing, Sheldon.",6,Big Bang Theory,27,4
28451,Sheldon,11," It was simple. I combined a well-known historical fact about Bohemia with the memory of my grandparents, Mee-Maw and Pop-Pop, singing Christmas carols while I sat in front of the fire and tried to build a high-energy particle accelerator out of Legos.",6,Big Bang Theory,252,42
28452,Leonard,11," Okay, continuing our quest.",6,Big Bang Theory,28,4
28453,Sheldon,11," W-W-Wait. There's still four more verses. You don't sing a song and not finish it. Hither, page, and stand by me, if thou know'st it, telling. Yonder peasant, who is he? Where and what his dwelling? Brightly shone the moon that night, though the frost",6,Big Bang Theory,252,45
28456,Penny,11," Of course he is. Look, that girl just got dumped by her boyfriend. She's angry, she's drunk, and her favorite movie is Slumdog Millionaire. I mean.",6,Big Bang Theory,148,26
28457,Amy,11, That is some low-hanging fruit.,6,Big Bang Theory,32,5
28459,Penny,11," So, how'd it go?",6,Big Bang Theory,17,4
28460,Raj,11," Great. I bought her a couple of drinks, and she gave me her e-mail address.",6,Big Bang Theory,76,15
28461,Penny,11, Ooh!,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
28463,Raj,11, What?,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
28465,Raj,11," Why can't I find someone? I'm smart, I've got a cool job, and my naturally bronzed complexion means I can pull off mustard yellow in a way most guys can't.",6,Big Bang Theory,156,30
28466,Penny,11," Oh, honey, it's not you, it's them.",6,Big Bang Theory,36,7
28467,Raj,11," No, it's not. She was too beautiful for me.",6,Big Bang Theory,44,9
28469,Raj,11, It's true. I'm always attracted to women I can't have. I do it all the time. I did the same thing with the two of you.,6,Big Bang Theory,119,26
28470,Amy,11, The two of them? I don't understand.,6,Big Bang Theory,37,7
28471,Raj,11," Well, uh, there was a time when I had a thing for Penny, and I thought she was into me, too, because she got drunk and naked and climbed into bed with me. But apparently I misread those signals.",6,Big Bang Theory,195,39
28472,Amy,11, And you liked Bernadette also?,6,Big Bang Theory,31,5
28473,Raj,11, That was before Penny. I make it a rule to only fall for one of my friends' girlfriends at a time. I'm very old-fashioned that way.,6,Big Bang Theory,132,26
28474,Amy,11," So at, uh, some point, you probably had a thing for me, too.",6,Big Bang Theory,61,13
28475,Raj,11," No, not really.",6,Big Bang Theory,16,3
28476,Penny,11," Oh, come on, Raj, not even a little bit?",6,Big Bang Theory,41,9
28477,Raj,11, Not that I can think of.,6,Big Bang Theory,25,6
28479,Raj,11," Nope. I guess the heart wants what the heart wants. Or in this case, doesn't, I mean, at all. What?",6,Big Bang Theory,100,20
28481,Sheldon,11," Ye who now will bless the poor, shall yourselves find blessing. Ba-da-bum.",6,Big Bang Theory,75,12
28482,Howard,11, Done?,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
28483,Sheldon,11, I think the word you're looking for is bravo.,6,Big Bang Theory,46,9
28484,Leonard,11," Okay, you leave the room and find yourself standing before a pool of melted snowmen.",6,Big Bang Theory,85,15
28485,Sheldon,11, Melted snowmen? Are there carrots and lumps of coal in the water?,6,Big Bang Theory,66,12
28486,Leonard,11, I don't know. What's the difference?,6,Big Bang Theory,37,6
28487,Sheldon,11," Well it's a game of the imagination, Leonard. Paint a picture.",6,Big Bang Theory,63,11
28488,Leonard,11, Fine. You leave the room and find yourself standing before a pool of melted snowmen. There are carrots and lumps of coal in the water.,6,Big Bang Theory,135,25
28489,Sheldon,11, What happened to the top hats and the corncob pipes?,6,Big Bang Theory,53,10
28490,Leonard,11," You see those, too.",6,Big Bang Theory,20,4
28491,Sheldon,11," Oh, it's like I'm really there.",6,Big Bang Theory,32,6
28493,Howard,11, Good story.,6,Big Bang Theory,12,2
28494,Leonard,11, What are you drinking there? A little eggnog?,6,Big Bang Theory,46,8
28495,Sheldon,11," Yes. What, is there a problem?",6,Big Bang Theory,31,6
28496,Leonard,11," No, it's nice to see you enjoying a holiday beverage. Pretty Christmassy.",6,Big Bang Theory,74,12
28497,Sheldon,11, Since when is eggnog a Christmas drink? Eggs are available all year 'round. I've been known to enjoy this poolside.,6,Big Bang Theory,116,20
28498,Leonard,11," Come on, Sheldon. You know all the Christmas stories, and the carols, you've got an eggnog moustache going on there. Just admit it. You're getting a little Yuletide spirit.",6,Big Bang Theory,173,29
28499,Sheldon,11," Oh, don't be silly. Christmas is a bunch of baloney created by the tinsel industry. Why is this so important to you?",6,Big Bang Theory,117,22
28500,Leonard,11," Honestly, because I had enough crappy Christmases as a kid and I'm tired of you sucking the joy out of them now.",6,Big Bang Theory,113,22
28502,Leonard,11," I grew up in a house full of crazy academics. Instead of leaving Santa milk and cookies, we had to leave him a research paper. And in the morning, you could tell he'd been there because the paper would be graded.",6,Big Bang Theory,213,41
28503,Sheldon,11, No wonder you love Christmas. That sounds amazing.,6,Big Bang Theory,51,8
28504,Leonard,11, It wasn't amazing. I got a C-minus four years in a row.,6,Big Bang Theory,56,12
28505,Sheldon,11," Yeah, I'm familiar with your work. C-minus was your gift.",6,Big Bang Theory,58,10
28507,Raj,11," Amy, I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to upset you.",6,Big Bang Theory,51,10
28508,Amy,11," It's fine. I'm used to being the girl who never gets looked at twice. I didn't have my first kiss till I was 22, and the guy only did it so I'd give him back his insulin.",6,Big Bang Theory,171,37
28510,Amy,11, Forget it. I don't expect you guys to understand.,6,Big Bang Theory,50,9
28511,Raj,11," I understand. In seventh grade, I played Spin the Bottle and it landed on Alina Shankar. She said if I came near her, she would break the bottle and cut me.",6,Big Bang Theory,157,31
28512,Amy,11," You think that's bad? In college, I passed out at a frat party and woke up with more clothes on.",6,Big Bang Theory,97,20
28513,Raj,11," Sometimes I get so lonely, I sit on my left hand until it goes numb, then I put it in my right hand and pretend I'm holding hands with another person.",6,Big Bang Theory,151,31
28514,Amy,11," I do that, too. Sometimes the left hand tries to cop a feel. And I let it.",6,Big Bang Theory,75,17
28515,Raj,11, It's kind of nice to talk to someone who understands what it feels like to be alone.,6,Big Bang Theory,85,17
28516,Amy,11," It is, isn't it?",6,Big Bang Theory,17,4
28517,Raj,11, But you're not alone anymore. Now you've got Sheldon.,6,Big Bang Theory,54,9
28518,Amy,11," I do. And don't worry, someday you'll have somebody, too.",6,Big Bang Theory,58,10
28519,Raj,11, Thank you. I hope she's half as lovely and amazing as you are.,6,Big Bang Theory,63,13
28520,Amy,11," Thank you, Rajesh. He wants me, I'm good. We can go now.",6,Big Bang Theory,57,12
28521,Raj,11, Damn it.,6,Big Bang Theory,9,2
28522,Penny,11, What?,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
28523,Raj,11," Now that I know she doesn't like me, I'm kind of into her.",6,Big Bang Theory,59,13
28525,Sheldon,11, All right. I think I cracked the code to lower the drawbridge.,6,Big Bang Theory,63,12
28526,Howard,11, Great. Let's do it. ,6,Big Bang Theory,21,4
28527,Leonard,11, The drawbridge is lowering.,6,Big Bang Theory,28,4
28529,Sheldon,11, Play through the pain.,6,Big Bang Theory,23,4
28530,Leonard,11," You did it. The drawbridge is down. You cross the chasm and find yourself in a small dungeon room. And in the corner, chained to the wall, you see a bloodied and beaten Santa Claus. He says, ho, ho, help me.",6,Big Bang Theory,208,41
28531,Howard,11," Yes, we found Santa. Christmas is saved. Don't ever tell my mother I said that.",6,Big Bang Theory,80,15
28533,Sheldon,11," But first, I cast a spell of paralysis on Stuart and Howard.",6,Big Bang Theory,61,12
28534,Howard,11," Wait, what are you doing?",6,Big Bang Theory,26,5
28535,Sheldon,11," You can't talk, you're paralyzed. I get right up in Santa's big, fat face and say, well, well, well, jolly old Saint Nick, we meet again. Yeah, I believe the last time we spoke was in the Baybrook Mall in Galveston, Texas, when I was five years old, isn't that right?",6,Big Bang Theory,268,51
28536,Leonard,11," Uh, okay.",6,Big Bang Theory,10,2
28537,Sheldon,11," My mother dragged me there and she plopped me down on your lap and you asked me what I wanted for Christmas. And I told you, my Pop-Pop, because that was the year my grandfather died. I missed him and I wanted him back.",6,Big Bang Theory,220,44
28538,Leonard,11," This is weird, right?",6,Big Bang Theory,22,4
28539,Sheldon,11," Pop-Pop was the only one in my family who encouraged me to pursue science. But you didn't bring him back, did you? No, instead, I got Lincoln Logs. Well, you can build a lot of neat things out of Lincoln Logs, but Pop-Pop ain't one of 'em. And now you're here asking me for something, to save you. Well, sorry, Mr. Kringle, but today's not your day. I'm leaving you here to rot, and I hope the ogres feast on your bones. I take the skeleton key, and I toss it into the chasm, and on the way out, I give Santa a swift kick in his bowl full of jelly!",6,Big Bang Theory,549,111
28540,Leonard,11," Okay. So Wolowitz and Stuart are paralyzed, Santa's dead, and I picked this over having sex with my girlfriend.",6,Big Bang Theory,112,19
28542,Sheldon,11, Santa?,6,Big Bang Theory,7,1
28544,Sheldon,11," Well, then, you shouldn't have jingle bells on your boots.",6,Big Bang Theory,59,10
28546,Sheldon,11, I understand.,6,Big Bang Theory,14,2
28548,Sheldon,11," Oh, I hope it's a train.",6,Big Bang Theory,25,6
28550,Sheldon,11, Two trains?,6,Big Bang Theory,12,2
28552,Sheldon,11, I'm getting three trains.,6,Big Bang Theory,26,4
28554,Sheldon,11," Wait, uh, uh, hang on. In my defense",6,Big Bang Theory,37,8
28557,Sheldon,12," Well, I must say, Leonard, when I first heard your idea for Giant Jenga, I was sceptical.",6,Big Bang Theory,90,17
28558,Leonard,12, I can't blame you. Tiny Twister was a complete bust.,6,Big Bang Theory,53,10
28559,Sheldon,12," No, I was wrong. The looming threat of being crushed under a pile of lumber does add a certain spice. I've never felt so alive.  Oh, hello, Alex. Uh, let me go get you last night's recordings.",6,Big Bang Theory,193,37
28560,Leonard,12, What recordings?,6,Big Bang Theory,17,2
28561,Sheldon,12," Well, you remember when you told me I talk in my sleep? Well, it occurred to me that, like most things I say, it's probably pure gold. So I started recording it all, and now Alex gets to comb through eight hours of what I like to call Sheldon After Dark.",6,Big Bang Theory,255,51
28563,Leonard,12, Hey. Just playing a little Giant Jenga here.,6,Big Bang Theory,45,8
28565,Leonard,12," Well, most of Saturday's gonna be figuring out where to put this game when we're done. How about you?",6,Big Bang Theory,102,19
28567,Leonard,12, Ooh. That's his take on John Wheeler's quantum foam. That should be great.,6,Big Bang Theory,75,13
28569,Leonard,12," Ah, I'd love to, but I'm supposed to hang out with Penny.",6,Big Bang Theory,58,12
28571,Leonard,12," Well, she's not really into that kind of stuff.",6,Big Bang Theory,48,9
28573,Leonard,12, What?,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
28574,Sheldon,12," Jenga, I win!",6,Big Bang Theory,14,3
28576,Howard,12," Oh, come on, that can't be true.",6,Big Bang Theory,33,7
28577,Raj,12," I did the research. Tony the Tiger, Dig'em the Frog, Cap'n Crunch, Toucan Sam, Count Chocula, Trix the Rabbit, Snap, Crackle and Pop. Not one cereal mascot is a girl. It's a total breakfast sausage fest.",6,Big Bang Theory,204,36
28578,Leonard,12, Are we done with this?,6,Big Bang Theory,23,5
28579,Raj,12," Almost. Franken Berry, Boo Berry, Sugar Bear and the Honey Nut Cheerio bee, I believe his name is Buzz.",6,Big Bang Theory,104,19
28580,Leonard,12, Terrific. Something weird happened and I don't know what to do about it.,6,Big Bang Theory,73,13
28581,Howard,12, What's going on?,6,Big Bang Theory,17,3
28582,Leonard,12, Sheldon's assistant asked me on a date last night.,6,Big Bang Theory,51,9
28583,Raj,12, How could you do that to me? You know I've been working it with Alex for weeks.,6,Big Bang Theory,80,17
28584,Leonard,12, Working it? You can't even talk to her.,6,Big Bang Theory,40,8
28585,Raj,12, I talk with my eyes.,6,Big Bang Theory,21,5
28586,Howard,12, You look like my little cousin when he's dropping one in his diaper.,6,Big Bang Theory,69,13
28587,Leonard,12, She knows I have a girlfriend. It's so weird.,6,Big Bang Theory,46,9
28588,Raj,12," Oh, my God. You're loving this.",6,Big Bang Theory,32,6
28589,Leonard,12," To my bones. I mean, I'm not gonna do anything about it. I love Penny. It's just nice to have a young, attractive woman sniffing around the goods.",6,Big Bang Theory,147,28
28590,Raj,12, I both hate you and want to be you. This is Ryan Gosling all over again.,6,Big Bang Theory,73,16
28591,Sheldon,12," Ah, gentlemen, what is on the conversational menu this morning?",6,Big Bang Theory,64,10
28592,Raj,12," Leonard stole my woman, and he knew full well I was only six to eight months away from making my move.",6,Big Bang Theory,103,21
28593,Leonard,12, I didn't steal anyone.,6,Big Bang Theory,23,4
28594,Raj,12, Your assistant is totally hitting on this jerk and he loves it.,6,Big Bang Theory,64,12
28595,Sheldon,12," Well, that's not acceptable. I mean, I'm her boss. She needs to be solely focused on my needs, not distracted by your pasty, androgynous brand of sexuality.",6,Big Bang Theory,157,27
28596,Leonard,12, I'm androgynous?,6,Big Bang Theory,17,2
28597,Sheldon,12," Oh, please. Look at you with your pouty bee-stung lips.",6,Big Bang Theory,56,10
28598,Leonard,12, What do you guys think I should do?,6,Big Bang Theory,36,8
28599,Raj,12," I say you tell Alex your heart belongs to Penny, I provide her a shoulder to cry on, and then roughly half a year later I give it to her good.",6,Big Bang Theory,143,31
28601,Sheldon,12," I want to thank you all for coming on such short notice. Uh, in the past, I've reached out to each of you individually, but I believe my present situation requires the collective wisdom of the group, which as you can see from your commemorative T-shirts I have dubbed Sheldon Cooper's Council of Ladies.",6,Big Bang Theory,304,54
28602,Penny,12, What is happening?,6,Big Bang Theory,19,3
28603,Sheldon,12," I need your advice about a delicate workplace situation. Uh, to protect those involved, I'll be changing their names.",6,Big Bang Theory,118,19
28605,Sheldon,12," Well, a short, bespectacled colleague of mine who lives in the shadow of his brilliant roommate. Let's call this colleague Ricardo Shilly-Shally.",6,Big Bang Theory,146,22
28606,Penny,12, You're talking about Leonard.,6,Big Bang Theory,30,4
28607,Sheldon,12," No, no, Shilly-Shally has red hair and, uh, he briefly served in the Mexican Navy. Anyway, despite the fact that he has a girlfriend, Shilly-Shally has been the recipient of inappropriate workplace flirtations from a young lady.",6,Big Bang Theory,229,37
28608,Amy,12," It's your assistant Alex, isn't it?",6,Big Bang Theory,36,6
28609,Sheldon,12, No. No. No. This is Tondelaya della Ventimiglia.,6,Big Bang Theory,49,8
28610,Penny,12," Wait, what the hell's going on with Leonard and Alex?",6,Big Bang Theory,54,10
28611,Sheldon,12," No, uh, no, I'm sorry. Who's talking about Leonard and Alex?",6,Big Bang Theory,61,11
28612,Penny,12, Fine. Ricardo and Tondelaya.,6,Big Bang Theory,29,4
28613,Sheldon,12," Okay, look, it's not really about Ricardo and Tondelaya. It is really about her boss, who doesn't quite know how to handle this situation and could use your advice, which is surprising because Dr. Einstein Von Brainstorm, he's usually pretty smart about these things.",6,Big Bang Theory,268,44
28614,Penny,12, I'm gonna kill her.,6,Big Bang Theory,20,4
28616,Amy,12," She's right. But say the word, I got a lab full of cocaine-addicted monkeys with nothing to lose. One of them could end up in the backseat of her car. Or her shower.",6,Big Bang Theory,166,33
28617,Sheldon,12," Ladies, ladies, please. We're not here to talk about Penny, okay? We're here to talk about me. Uh, I mean Einstein Von Brainstorm. Oh, darn it! All right, I guess the cat's out of the bag. Let me explain what's going on. Ricardo is really Leonard.",6,Big Bang Theory,248,46
28618,Penny,12," We know what's going on, Sheldon!",6,Big Bang Theory,34,6
28619,Sheldon,12," Well, what should I do?",6,Big Bang Theory,24,5
28621,Sheldon,12," Oh, no, he's not uncomfortable at all. No, he's loving it. Yeah, he's strutting around like he's five-foot-six.",6,Big Bang Theory,112,18
28622,Penny,12, What? He's loving it?,6,Big Bang Theory,22,4
28624,Sheldon,12," Talk to her? That's all you've got? With a cool name like Sheldon Cooper's Council of Ladies, I really expected more. Give me back the T-shirts.",6,Big Bang Theory,145,26
28626,Sheldon,12," Alex, check my schedule. What does my afternoon look like?",6,Big Bang Theory,59,10
28628,Sheldon,12," Well, that snuck up on us, didn't it?",6,Big Bang Theory,38,8
28630,Sheldon,12, Let's not call it a problem. Let's call it an opportunity. To solve a serious problem.,6,Big Bang Theory,87,16
28632,Sheldon,12," You don't know? Oh, you poor dear. Your ovaries are squirting so much goofy juice into your brains you don't even know which way is up. You made an inappropriate sexual advance towards Dr. Hofstadter.",6,Big Bang Theory,201,35
28634,Sheldon,12," Now, there's no need to get defensive. I'm not unsympathetic to your plight. My father used to say that a woman is like an egg salad sandwich on a warm Texas day.",6,Big Bang Theory,163,32
28636,Sheldon,12, Full of eggs and only appealing for a short time.,6,Big Bang Theory,50,10
28638,Sheldon,12," Yeah, you and me both, sister. Now, please understand, I don't hold you responsible for your behaviour because, see, from an evolutionary standpoint, you're a slave to your desire to reproduce. But during the work day, when you feel possessed by amorous intent, may I suggest that you suppress it by leafing through this illustrated book of sexually transmitted diseases? Let's see here. Oh, yes. Check out this oozy doozy.",6,Big Bang Theory,424,70
28640,Sheldon,12," So does this fellow, but he can't without it burning like hot soup.",6,Big Bang Theory,68,13
28642,Leonard,12," Hey, pretty lady.",6,Big Bang Theory,18,3
28643,Penny,12," Oh, you seem extra happy.",6,Big Bang Theory,26,5
28644,Leonard,12," Uh, I guess I am.",6,Big Bang Theory,18,5
28645,Penny,12, Any particular reason why?,6,Big Bang Theory,27,4
28646,Leonard,12," I don't know, just having a good day. This morning Sheldon fell asleep on the way to work, so I got to listen to the radio. That was pretty crazy.",6,Big Bang Theory,147,30
28647,Penny,12, Mm-hmm. Anything else?,6,Big Bang Theory,23,3
28648,Leonard,12, Mm. I found this quiz online called Which Star Trek Character Are You? and it only took me four tries to get Captain Kirk.,6,Big Bang Theory,123,24
28649,Penny,12, That's great.,6,Big Bang Theory,14,2
28650,Leonard,12, Oh. It. Was.,6,Big Bang Theory,13,3
28651,Penny,12," Hmm. Well, I'm glad you're having such a great day.",6,Big Bang Theory,52,10
28652,Leonard,12, Yeah. And the one thing that could make it even better is an evening with my special girl.,6,Big Bang Theory,91,18
28653,Penny,12," Oh, and who's that?",6,Big Bang Theory,20,4
28654,Leonard,12, What do you mean?,6,Big Bang Theory,18,4
28655,Penny,12," Oh, I just didn't know if you meant me or Alex.",6,Big Bang Theory,48,11
28656,Leonard,12," Um, why would I mean Alex?",6,Big Bang Theory,27,6
28657,Penny,12, Because I know she hit on you and I know you liked it.,6,Big Bang Theory,55,13
28658,Leonard,12, What?,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
28659,Penny,12," Don't play dumb with me, Ricardo Shilly-Shally!",6,Big Bang Theory,48,7
28660,Leonard,12, I'm missing something.  Did you say something to Penny about Alex?,6,Big Bang Theory,67,11
28661,Sheldon,12," Oh, yes. Yeah, and a fat lot of good it did me. All she did was get mad at you.",6,Big Bang Theory,80,20
28662,Leonard,12, Why would you do that?,6,Big Bang Theory,23,5
28663,Sheldon,12," I needed advice about a woman. I would have asked you, but if the last few years have proven anything, it's that you can't tell a uterus from a unicycle.",6,Big Bang Theory,154,30
28664,Leonard,12, At least I know not to blab to a girl about somebody flirting with her boyfriend.,6,Big Bang Theory,82,16
28665,Sheldon,12," Good to know. Yeah, a few more helpful hints like that, you may find yourself on the Council of Ladies.  Hello. I see. Uh, what time? Very well, then. Huh. That was the Human Resources Department at the university. Apparently, my assistant Alex has filed a complaint accusing me of inappropriate behaviour in the workplace.",6,Big Bang Theory,324,55
28666,Leonard,12," Oh, my God, what did you do?",6,Big Bang Theory,29,7
28667,Sheldon,12," Hmm, let me think. Nothing. I'm a delight.",6,Big Bang Theory,43,8
28669,Sheldon,12,  Human Resources Department.  Human Resources Department.  Human Resources Department.,6,Big Bang Theory,87,9
28671,Sheldon,12, Hello.,6,Big Bang Theory,7,1
28673,Sheldon,12, Thank you.,6,Big Bang Theory,11,2
28675,Sheldon,12," So I've been told. But I can't understand what she has to complain about. I mean, she has a front-row seat as I make scientific history. There's string cheese in my mini-fridge, and that's for anyone. Yeah, and just yesterday I led her away from a life of sexual promiscuity by making her look at pictures of disease-ridden genitalia.",6,Big Bang Theory,335,59
28677,Sheldon,12, Like what?,6,Big Bang Theory,11,2
28679,Sheldon,12," Oh! I see the confusion here. No, no, Alex thought I was singling her out. No. I meant that all women are slaves to their biological urges, you know? Even you. You're a slave.",6,Big Bang Theory,176,34
28681,Sheldon,12," Well, y-you, I-I'm just saying, you know, at a certain point in a woman's menstrual cycle",6,Big Bang Theory,90,16
28683,Sheldon,12," I don't see why I'm the one being persecuted here. Dr. Hofstadter, he was bragging about his sexual desirability to anyone who would listen. You know, and Howard Wolowitz, he spent two years using university resources building a six-breasted sex robot. Oh, and at the office Christmas party, I heard Rajesh Koothrappali refer to you several times as Brown Sugar.",6,Big Bang Theory,363,60
28685,Sheldon,12," Yes. No, yeah, but in his defense, that wasn't racist. He's also brown.",6,Big Bang Theory,72,13
28687,Leonard,12," I'm sorry Alex hit on me, hit on me, hit on me. I'm sorry Alex hit on me, I'd no idea I'm cute.",6,Big Bang Theory,96,23
28688,Penny,12," Oh, damn it, you are.",6,Big Bang Theory,22,5
28689,Leonard,12, Please forgive me. I should have told you about Alex.,6,Big Bang Theory,54,10
28690,Penny,12," I don't care about Alex. Fine, I care. Okay, I hate that bitch. But what really hurt is that you liked it so much. I mean, do I need to be worried?",6,Big Bang Theory,148,32
28691,Leonard,12, Of course not. No. Why?,6,Big Bang Theory,24,5
28692,Penny,12," Because, she is pretty and smart, and when you talk about work, she doesn't have to go home and look up words in the dictionary to understand what you said.",6,Big Bang Theory,157,30
28693,Leonard,12, You do that?,6,Big Bang Theory,13,3
28694,Penny,12, No.,6,Big Bang Theory,4,1
28695,Leonard,12," Hang on. Are you feeling insecure? Because that's my thing, and if you take it away, I don't know what I'm bringing to this relationship.",6,Big Bang Theory,138,25
28696,Penny,12," Yes, Leonard, I am insecure. Happy?",6,Big Bang Theory,36,6
28697,Leonard,12," No, I'm not happy.",6,Big Bang Theory,19,4
28698,Penny,12, Why are you smiling?,6,Big Bang Theory,21,4
28699,Leonard,12, I'm sorry. I just never think of you having feelings like that.,6,Big Bang Theory,64,12
28700,Penny,12," Well, I do.",6,Big Bang Theory,12,3
28701,Leonard,12, Why? Nothing is ever going to happen between me and Alex.,6,Big Bang Theory,58,11
28702,Penny,12, Good.,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
28703,Leonard,12, Come here. Tell you a secret?,6,Big Bang Theory,30,6
28704,Penny,12, What's that?,6,Big Bang Theory,13,2
28705,Leonard,12," With all these women chasing me, I kind of do feel like Captain Kirk.",6,Big Bang Theory,70,14
28706,Penny,12, Can I tell you a secret?,6,Big Bang Theory,25,6
28707,Leonard,12, Sure.,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
28708,Penny,12," Keep talking about Captain Kirk, and we're all gonna stop.",6,Big Bang Theory,59,10
28709,Leonard,12," Message received. Ah, excuse me.  Hello. This is Dr. Hofstadter. Okay. All right, thank you. That's weird. I'm getting called in to Human Resources.",6,Big Bang Theory,149,24
28710,Penny,12, What did you do?,6,Big Bang Theory,17,4
28711,Leonard,12, I don't know.,6,Big Bang Theory,14,3
28713,Howard,12, Huh. I just got called in to Human Resources.,6,Big Bang Theory,46,9
28715,Howard,12, I don't know.,6,Big Bang Theory,14,3
28717,Raj,12, Huh. That is so strange. Human Resources wants to talk to me tomorrow.  Could you stop licking your ass for two minutes? I have a problem here.,6,Big Bang Theory,144,27
28719,Howard,12, Do you really think you should be drinking right now?,6,Big Bang Theory,54,10
28720,Raj,12, How else am I supposed to talk to the Human Resources lady?,6,Big Bang Theory,60,12
28721,Howard,12, I don't know. Seek professional help?,6,Big Bang Theory,38,6
28722,Raj,12, I did. The guy at the liquor store said this stuff tastes great in coffee.,6,Big Bang Theory,75,15
28723,Howard,12," Wait, you got called in, too? What is going on?",6,Big Bang Theory,48,10
28724,Leonard,12, Sheldon threw us all under the bus.,6,Big Bang Theory,36,7
28725,Howard,12, Oh.,6,Big Bang Theory,4,1
28726,Raj,12, I feel like I've been called down to the principal's office. Although I wouldn't mind if Brown Sugar suspended me. From a sex swing. This may have been a mistake.,6,Big Bang Theory,163,30
28727,Howard,12," Relax. Everything's gonna be fine. Before I met Bernadette I was in here every other day. Uh, little tip, turn off your I Like Big Butts ringtone before you go in.",6,Big Bang Theory,164,31
28728,Raj,12," Well, this is all your fault.",6,Big Bang Theory,30,6
28729,Leonard,12, How is this my fault?,6,Big Bang Theory,22,5
28730,Raj,12," If you weren't screwing around with Sheldon's assistant, none of this would be happening.",6,Big Bang Theory,90,14
28731,Leonard,12, I wasn't screwing around with anyone.,6,Big Bang Theory,38,6
28732,Raj,12," Oh, of course not. She was just sniffing around your goods because she was hunting for truffles.",6,Big Bang Theory,97,17
28734,Howard,12," Hey, Janine. How are Tom and the kids?",6,Big Bang Theory,39,8
28736,Leonard,12," Yes, but I think this is all a big misunderstanding.",6,Big Bang Theory,53,10
28737,Raj,12," Yeah, yeah, me, too. I didn't do anything.",6,Big Bang Theory,43,8
28739,Raj,12, Howard built a sex robot.,6,Big Bang Theory,26,5
28740,Howard,12, That is not true. All I did was build a robot.,6,Big Bang Theory,47,11
28742,Howard,12," I'm sorry, I'm a feminist, I don't notice things like how many breasts a robot has.",6,Big Bang Theory,84,16
28743,Sheldon,12," Well, hello.",6,Big Bang Theory,13,2
28744,Leonard,12, What are you doing here?,6,Big Bang Theory,25,5
28745,Sheldon,12," Actually, I came to speak to Mrs. Davis.",6,Big Bang Theory,41,8
28747,Sheldon,12, But I came to file a complaint. Somebody has made me feel uncomfortable in the workplace by using language of an inappropriate and sexual nature.,6,Big Bang Theory,146,25
28749,Sheldon,12," You, you dirty birdie. I-I thought about the things you said to me yesterday, and I realized I'm deeply offended. Now, be a dear and get me one of those complaint forms.",6,Big Bang Theory,170,32
28751,Sheldon,12," And thanks to you, I know better than to ask if you're menstruating. And based on your behaviour, I don't have to.",6,Big Bang Theory,115,22
28753,Sheldon,12," It has been pointed out to me that some of the things I said to you could be construed as offensive, and I would like to offer you my sincerest apology.",6,Big Bang Theory,153,31
28755,Sheldon,12," Yeah, additionally, you should know that the university has mandated that I take an online sexual harassment seminar so this sort of thing doesn't happen in the future.",6,Big Bang Theory,169,28
28757,Sheldon,12," Yeah. Now, unfortunately, uh, my time is much too valuable to waste on nonsense like this, so, um, I'm gonna need you to take it for me. Oh, and, uh, you'd better ace it, they're pretty mad.",6,Big Bang Theory,191,37
28759,Penny,12," So, hey, I was thinking about that stuff with Alex.",6,Big Bang Theory,52,10
28760,Leonard,12," Oh, would you stop worrying about that?",6,Big Bang Theory,40,7
28761,Penny,12," I can't help it. But, look, I figured I could sit around and feel insecure, or I could do something about it. So I got a course catalogue at school and looked at some of the science classes.",6,Big Bang Theory,191,38
28762,Leonard,12, That's great.,6,Big Bang Theory,14,2
28763,Penny,12," No, it isn't, they are extremely boring. I mean, how do you not kill yourself, like, every day? Anyway, I decided I don't need to be a scientist, I could just look like one. So I bought these.",6,Big Bang Theory,193,38
28764,Leonard,12," Glasses? I really don't think that's gonna change oh, my God, you look so smart and hot.",6,Big Bang Theory,89,17
28765,Penny,12," I know, right? Watch this. Molecules.",6,Big Bang Theory,38,6
28766,Leonard,12," Okay, come with me.",6,Big Bang Theory,20,4
28767,Penny,12, Where are we going?,6,Big Bang Theory,20,4
28768,Leonard,12," To my bedroom, so I can take everything off but those glasses. And maybe the boots.",6,Big Bang Theory,84,16
28770,Leonard,13," Hey, will you steam my uniform next?",6,Big Bang Theory,37,7
28771,Sheldon,13," Interesting. Do you recall this conversation? Leonard, want to go halfsies on a steamer? No, Sheldon, we don't need a steamer. Looks like that rumpled chicken's come home to roost.",6,Big Bang Theory,181,30
28772,Penny,13, Hi. Here are the make-up sponges you asked for.,6,Big Bang Theory,48,9
28773,Leonard,13," Oh, thanks, I thought I had more.",6,Big Bang Theory,34,7
28774,Penny,13," Damn, you've got more makeup than I do. You've got better makeup than I do. Yeah, I'm borrowing this.",6,Big Bang Theory,102,19
28775,Leonard,13," Hey, hey, hey, hey. This is my Comic-Con makeup. I love you, but there are some things a man doesn't share with his girlfriend.",6,Big Bang Theory,128,24
28776,Sheldon,13," That's a wise policy. I once borrowed my sister's makeup for a costume contest. Got a terrible case of pinkeye. But luckily, I was going as a zombie. I won second place.",6,Big Bang Theory,170,32
28777,Penny,13, I feel like you guys just went to Comic-Con.,6,Big Bang Theory,45,9
28778,Leonard,13, That was San Diego Comic-Con. This is Bakersfield Comic-Con.,6,Big Bang Theory,61,9
28779,Penny,13, Is that better?,6,Big Bang Theory,16,3
28780,Leonard,13," Well, it's a lot smaller. It's more about the comic books. The way these conventions used to be before they went all Hollywood.",6,Big Bang Theory,128,23
28781,Sheldon,13," So to answer your question, no, it's not better.",6,Big Bang Theory,49,9
28782,Penny,13," Well, then why are you going?",6,Big Bang Theory,30,6
28783,Sheldon,13," It's a comic book convention. You know, it's like pizza or particle accelerators, even the stinky one's still pretty good.",6,Big Bang Theory,123,20
28784,Penny,13," All right. Well, you guys have fun. I guess I'll see you Sunday night.",6,Big Bang Theory,71,14
28785,Leonard,13, Yeah.,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
28786,Penny,13, Okay.,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
28787,Leonard,13," Oh, hang on a second.  Hold this. ",6,Big Bang Theory,35,7
28788,Penny,13, What was that for?,6,Big Bang Theory,19,4
28789,Leonard,13, To show people when they don't believe me.,6,Big Bang Theory,43,8
28791,Penny,13," Oh, this is the best. You have booze with breakfast on a Tuesday, you got a problem. You do it on the weekend, you got brunch.",6,Big Bang Theory,127,26
28792,Amy,13, Sheldon doesn't believe in brunch. He can't stand being at a table where one person's having an omelette and another person's having a sandwich.,6,Big Bang Theory,145,24
28794,Penny,13," Oh. It's Leonard. He says they're on the road and headed for Bakersfield at warp speed. Maybe it's the mimosa, but I'm gonna give the kid an LOL.",6,Big Bang Theory,146,28
28796,Amy,13, When did Howard learn to sew?,6,Big Bang Theory,30,6
28798,Amy,13, I don't even understand why they go to these conventions.,6,Big Bang Theory,58,10
28799,Penny,13, I know. The four of them work at a major university. They're all super smart. How can they still be into something made for 12-year-olds?,6,Big Bang Theory,138,25
28801,Amy,13," It's probably because they were bullied growing up. In a world where you can't fight back, superheroes provide meaningful wish-fulfillment.",6,Big Bang Theory,140,20
28802,Penny,13," Mmmm. Now I feel bad for picking on all those kids. Although, in my defence, if Danny Biffle didn't want to eat a mouthful of dirt, he shouldn't have shown up to school wearing a bow tie.",6,Big Bang Theory,188,37
28804,Penny,13, Uh-uh.,6,Big Bang Theory,7,1
28805,Amy,13, No.,6,Big Bang Theory,4,1
28807,Amy,13, Seriously?,6,Big Bang Theory,11,1
28809,Penny,13," That is an amazing idea. Okay, how many of these have I had?",6,Big Bang Theory,61,13
28811,Sheldon,13, I think you should turn on the GPS.,6,Big Bang Theory,36,8
28812,Leonard,13, It is on.,6,Big Bang Theory,10,3
28813,Sheldon,13, But the turn-by-turn voice option isn't on. I know I'd feel more safe if you turn on the turn-by-turn voice option. I love the turn-by-turn voice option.,6,Big Bang Theory,154,27
28814,Howard,13, Has it really only been ten miles?,6,Big Bang Theory,35,7
28815,Leonard,13," I'm turning it on, but just to shut you up.",6,Big Bang Theory,44,10
28817,Sheldon,13," Ooh, sounds like that fellow knows what he's talking about. I'd put on my listening ears if I were you.",6,Big Bang Theory,104,20
28818,Leonard,13, What did you do?,6,Big Bang Theory,17,4
28819,Sheldon,13, I found a hack online. I was able to upload MP3 recordings of my voice to your GPS.,6,Big Bang Theory,84,18
28820,Raj,13, That is so cool.,6,Big Bang Theory,17,4
28821,Leonard,13," Counterpoint, no, it's not.",6,Big Bang Theory,28,4
28823,Leonard,13, Really?,6,Big Bang Theory,8,1
28824,Sheldon,13," Shh, he said it's interesting.",6,Big Bang Theory,31,5
28826,Howard,13," Look, Leonard, there's a bridge. Drive off it.",6,Big Bang Theory,47,8
28827,Raj,13," You know, we're not that far from Vazquez Rocks.",6,Big Bang Theory,49,9
28828,Sheldon,13," Oh, they shot a lot of Star Trek episodes out there.",6,Big Bang Theory,53,11
28829,Howard,13, We've got our costumes in the trunk. We could go there and have a little photo shoot.,6,Big Bang Theory,86,17
28830,Raj,13, Great idea. I haven't had a carbohydrate in two weeks. These cheekbones need to be in front of a camera before I eat a pretzel and they're gone.,6,Big Bang Theory,145,28
28831,Leonard,13," Yeah, that sounds fun.",6,Big Bang Theory,23,4
28832,Sheldon,13," Oh, smashing. Now, Leonard, do you know how to get there?",6,Big Bang Theory,58,11
28833,Leonard,13, No.,6,Big Bang Theory,4,1
28834,Sheldon,13," Yeah, well luckily, someone in the car does.",6,Big Bang Theory,45,8
28836,Sheldon,13, None of you will get it. It's Eisenhower.,6,Big Bang Theory,42,8
28839,Amy,13," Who cares? Just soak it in. Hello, boys.",6,Big Bang Theory,41,8
28841,Penny,13," Hey, Stuart.",6,Big Bang Theory,13,2
28845,Penny,13," No, we were just wondering why the guys like this stuff so much, so we thought we'd give it a try.",6,Big Bang Theory,99,21
28849,Amy,13," All right, well, who's the best superhero?",6,Big Bang Theory,43,7
28851,Penny,13," Well then, what do you recommend?",6,Big Bang Theory,34,6
28853,Amy,13," Ooh, I do love a bad boy.",6,Big Bang Theory,26,7
28854,Penny,13, As evidenced by your boyfriend and his fear of hamsters.,6,Big Bang Theory,57,10
28856,Penny,13," Ooh, Thor! He's hot.",6,Big Bang Theory,21,4
28859,Raj,13," And we're blending, and we're blending, and we're done.",6,Big Bang Theory,56,9
28860,Sheldon,13," I know Mr. Data isn't supposed to smile, but here it comes.",6,Big Bang Theory,60,12
28861,Howard,13," Come on, guys. Let's do this.",6,Big Bang Theory,30,6
28862,Leonard,13," Yeah, I'm sweating my bald cap off.",6,Big Bang Theory,36,7
28863,Howard,13, So what's our first pose going to be?,6,Big Bang Theory,38,8
28864,Raj,13, I say we begin with a classic Star Trek fight scene.,6,Big Bang Theory,53,11
28865,Leonard,13, I'll set the timer.,6,Big Bang Theory,20,4
28866,Howard,13," Sheldon, how is that a fight pose?",6,Big Bang Theory,35,7
28867,Sheldon,13, Mr. Data's weapon is his mind. I'm wielding it.,6,Big Bang Theory,48,9
28868,Raj,13, Phasers on the Borg! Charlie's Angels.,6,Big Bang Theory,39,6
28869,Howard,13," Okay, what's next?",6,Big Bang Theory,19,3
28870,Raj,13," Now let's do some sexy glamour shots. I'll set the mood.  Oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, Yeah, nice one, oontz, oontz. That's right. Oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz",6,Big Bang Theory,262,41
28871,Howard,13," Oh, my God. Leonard, someone's stealing your car!",6,Big Bang Theory,50,8
28872,Leonard,13," What? Hey, hey! Come back here!",6,Big Bang Theory,32,6
28873,Raj,13, Stop!,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
28874,Sheldon,13, Stealing is against the law!,6,Big Bang Theory,29,5
28875,Leonard,13, I don't believe this.,6,Big Bang Theory,22,4
28876,Howard,13, Son of a bitch.,6,Big Bang Theory,16,4
28877,Raj,13," I'll call 911. What, oh, no, my phone is in my other pants.",6,Big Bang Theory,60,13
28878,Howard,13," Oh, so is mine.",6,Big Bang Theory,16,4
28879,Leonard,13," Mine, too. Anybody got any ideas?",6,Big Bang Theory,34,6
28880,Sheldon,13, Nope. The only thing left to do now is assign blame.  Nice going.,6,Big Bang Theory,66,13
28882,Leonard,13, What kind of a person steals another person's car in broad daylight?,6,Big Bang Theory,69,12
28883,Sheldon,13, What kind of person leaves his keys in the car?,6,Big Bang Theory,48,10
28884,Leonard,13, I thought we agreed this was all Koothrappali's fault.,6,Big Bang Theory,55,9
28885,Sheldon,13, You're right. Nice going.,6,Big Bang Theory,26,4
28886,Howard,13, Car.,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
28887,Raj,13, What is wrong with people? Why don't they stop?,6,Big Bang Theory,48,9
28888,Sheldon,13, Maybe we're better off. What if we were to get in a car with a crazy person?,6,Big Bang Theory,77,17
28889,Leonard,13," Look at us, Sheldon. We're the crazy people.",6,Big Bang Theory,45,8
28890,Sheldon,13," Well, perhaps we should hold up a sign that assures passing motorists of our mental competence.",6,Big Bang Theory,96,16
28891,Howard,13, Good idea. Why don't you get started on that?,6,Big Bang Theory,46,9
28892,Leonard,13," Come on, let's just start walking. There's got to be a gas station or something nearby.",6,Big Bang Theory,88,16
28893,Sheldon,13," What, you think just because you're wearing a captain's uniform, you're in charge?",6,Big Bang Theory,83,13
28894,Leonard,13, Yes.,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
28895,Sheldon,13, All right.,6,Big Bang Theory,11,2
28897,Penny,13," Hmm, okay, I'm done. How did you guys finish so fast?",6,Big Bang Theory,54,11
28899,Penny,13," Yeah, well, I have street smarts.",6,Big Bang Theory,34,6
28901,Amy,13," Well, there was a lot of action.",6,Big Bang Theory,33,7
28902,Penny,13, Mmm.,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
28903,Amy,13," And the story moved along at a brisk pace. It was, overall, what's the word I'm looking for?",6,Big Bang Theory,93,18
28904,Penny,13, Stupid?,6,Big Bang Theory,8,1
28905,Amy,13, So stupid.,6,Big Bang Theory,11,2
28906,Penny,13, I don't know how Leonard can get so caught up in this.,6,Big Bang Theory,55,12
28908,Amy,13, What a waste of time.,6,Big Bang Theory,22,5
28909,Penny,13, I know. A hammer so heavy that no one else can pick it up?,6,Big Bang Theory,59,14
28911,Penny,13," That makes even less sense, I mean",6,Big Bang Theory,35,7
28912,Amy,13," No, no, no, it doesn't. Thor is a god. The hammer is his, only he can use it. It's like Sheldon and his toothbrush. Or his thin, beckoning lips.",6,Big Bang Theory,145,29
28913,Penny,13," Okay, hang on, what if Thor's hand is on the hammer? I mean, if he's touching it with his god magic, does that mean I could lift it?",6,Big Bang Theory,133,28
28915,Amy,13, Yes.,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
28916,Penny,13," Well, which is it?",6,Big Bang Theory,19,4
28917,Amy,13, Maybe we missed something.,6,Big Bang Theory,27,4
28919,Penny,13, Okay.,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
28920,Amy,13, Yeah.,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
28922,Amy,13, Good idea. I'll help you.,6,Big Bang Theory,26,5
28923,Penny,13," Wait, I thought we were reading.",6,Big Bang Theory,33,6
28924,Amy,13," We are. We're just, uh, giving you a head start.",6,Big Bang Theory,49,10
28926,Howard,13, I wish my mom was here. We could all hang out in her shadow.,6,Big Bang Theory,61,14
28927,Raj,13, Wool pants in the desert. I feel like I've got poached testicles.,6,Big Bang Theory,66,12
28928,Leonard,13," Oh, you poor thing, you're sweating. That's so much worse than having your car stolen.",6,Big Bang Theory,87,15
28929,Raj,13, Insurance is gonna buy you a new car. It's not gonna de-funk my junk.,6,Big Bang Theory,70,14
28930,Sheldon,13," Gentlemen, a little less bellyaching. We're Starfleet officers and a member of the Borg Collective.",6,Big Bang Theory,100,15
28931,Leonard,13," Please, Sheldon, I am so not in the mood.",6,Big Bang Theory,42,9
28932,Sheldon,13," Leonard, all our lives we have dreamed of finding ourselves inside one of the fantasy worlds we love. And look at us. At this moment, we are, in fact, a Star Trek landing party stranded in an alien and unforgiving environment, relying only on our wits, our fortitude and our moxie. As long as we have those things, nothing can stop",6,Big Bang Theory,332,61
28934,Sheldon,13, I hate this planet.,6,Big Bang Theory,20,4
28936,Amy,13," It says right here on the hammer, whoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor.",6,Big Bang Theory,111,21
28938,Penny,13, Yes!,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
28939,Amy,13, No! It can't decide. It's a hammer.,6,Big Bang Theory,36,7
28940,Penny,13, You said it's a magic hammer.,6,Big Bang Theory,30,6
28941,Amy,13," Yeah, but, it can't make decisions.",6,Big Bang Theory,36,6
28942,Penny,13," If Harry Potter's wand can make decisions, why can't Thor's hammer?",6,Big Bang Theory,68,11
28943,Amy,13," Okay, if you're going to start comparing wands and hammers, I can't even take you seriously.",6,Big Bang Theory,93,16
28945,Sheldon,13," Hello. Hello. Uh, uh, uh, four glasses of water, please. Anything for you guys?",6,Big Bang Theory,80,14
28946,Leonard,13, Can I use your phone? Our car got stolen.,6,Big Bang Theory,42,9
28948,Sheldon,13," Scotty was on the original series, and we're Next Generation. So, joke's on you.",6,Big Bang Theory,81,14
28949,Howard,13, We're not with him.,6,Big Bang Theory,20,4
28951,Amy,13," You can't pick something up in outer space. In space, there is no up.",6,Big Bang Theory,70,14
28952,Penny,13," Oh, yeah? Then how does the sun come up every day?",6,Big Bang Theory,51,11
28953,Amy,13, Hard to argue with those kind of street smarts.,6,Big Bang Theory,48,9
28955,Penny,13," Oh, great. Yes. And then you will see, I am not wrong, because if we were in outer space, then anyone could pick up the hammer because it would be floating around in a weightless environment. Yeah, that's right, the slow reader used science. Suck on that.",6,Big Bang Theory,256,47
28958,Leonard,13," Our clothes, our wallets, phones.",6,Big Bang Theory,34,5
28959,Raj,13," And about three hundred dollars worth of makeup, so this thief could look like anyone right now.",6,Big Bang Theory,97,17
28961,Leonard,13," Uh, we're going to the Comic-Con in Bakersfield. They have a big costume contest. It's cooler than it sounds.",6,Big Bang Theory,110,19
28963,Raj,13," It, it is. It's not just comic books. They've got action figures, toys, a Tron-themed dance party.",6,Big Bang Theory,99,17
28964,Leonard,13," Okay, he gets how cool it is.",6,Big Bang Theory,30,7
28966,Leonard,13," Thanks, but we've got it covered.",6,Big Bang Theory,34,6
28967,Howard,13," Okay, I just talked to my mom. She arranged for us to get a rental car.",6,Big Bang Theory,72,16
28968,Raj,13, Great. We can still make it to Comic-Con.,6,Big Bang Theory,42,8
28969,Leonard,13," Are you kidding me? After all we've been through, I just want to go home.",6,Big Bang Theory,74,15
28970,Raj,13," Don't be like that. Come on, Howard, talk to him.",6,Big Bang Theory,50,10
28971,Howard,13, I'm with Leonard. I'm done.,6,Big Bang Theory,28,5
28972,Raj,13," Fine, then I guess it's two against two. How do we decide?",6,Big Bang Theory,59,12
28973,Sheldon,13," Actually, it's three against one.",6,Big Bang Theory,34,5
28974,Raj,13, What? What about the mission? You said we were a real-life landing party.,6,Big Bang Theory,74,13
28975,Sheldon,13," Yeah, well, we're not. We're an imaginary landing party who had real-life garbage thrown at us by real-life strangers who think we're idiots. And to tell you the truth, I'm starting to feel like one. I want to go home now.",6,Big Bang Theory,223,41
28976,Raj,13, Okay. Did we at least rent the car from Enterprise? Get it? Enterprise? Screw you. That's funny.,6,Big Bang Theory,97,17
28979,Amy,13, Yeah?,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
28981,Amy,13," No. Hulk picked up Thor, Thor picked up the hammer.",6,Big Bang Theory,52,10
28982,Penny,13," Okay, hang on. If I go to a bar and pick up a guy, and he picks up a girl, and then we all leave together, did I pick up the girl?",6,Big Bang Theory,131,32
28983,Amy,13, Did that ever happen?,6,Big Bang Theory,22,4
28984,Penny,13," Hey, are we talking about me or are we talking about Thor?",6,Big Bang Theory,59,12
28986,Sheldon,13," Well, I say that's the last time we ever go outside.",6,Big Bang Theory,53,11
28987,Amy,13," Look, right here. Red Hulk is picking up Thor's hammer 'cause Thor's touching it.",6,Big Bang Theory,82,14
28988,Penny,13," No, it's because they're in space. He's really just touching the strap.",6,Big Bang Theory,72,12
28989,Amy,13, The strap is part of the hammer.,6,Big Bang Theory,33,7
28991,Raj,13, Are they actually arguing about comic books?,6,Big Bang Theory,45,7
28992,Leonard,13," No, that can't be right.",6,Big Bang Theory,25,5
28993,Howard,13, Maybe Thor's Hammer is a new colour of nail polish.,6,Big Bang Theory,52,10
28995,Penny,13, How could Red Hulk be worthy?,6,Big Bang Theory,30,6
28997,Sheldon,13, There's only one logical explanation. Somewhere in the desert we crossed into an alternate dimension where the women in our lives can finally appreciate great literature.,6,Big Bang Theory,171,26
28998,Raj,13," If it's an alternate dimension, sounds like a job for a landing party.",6,Big Bang Theory,71,13
28999,Sheldon,13," Captain, what are your orders?",6,Big Bang Theory,31,5
29000,Leonard,13, I say we investigate.,6,Big Bang Theory,22,4
29001,Sheldon,13, Wait. They might be hostile.,6,Big Bang Theory,29,5
29002,Leonard,13," Fine, but set them to stun. If we vaporize Penny, I'll never find a girlfriend that pretty again.",6,Big Bang Theory,98,18
29011,Leonard,14," Sheldon, your food's getting cold.",6,Big Bang Theory,35,5
29012,Sheldon,14," I'll eat later. Right now, I'm suckling at the informative bosom of mother physics.",6,Big Bang Theory,84,14
29013,Penny,14, It's hot when Sheldon talks dirty.,6,Big Bang Theory,35,6
29014,Raj,14," So, I found this Web site where you send them pictures, they sculpt your head and make an action figure out of you. How awesome is that?",6,Big Bang Theory,137,27
29015,Howard,14, Let me see.,6,Big Bang Theory,12,3
29016,Raj,14," Yeah, you can pick your wardrobe. You can even choose your accessories.",6,Big Bang Theory,72,12
29017,Howard,14," Leonard, you can get a little asthma inhaler.",6,Big Bang Theory,46,8
29018,Leonard,14," Oh, this is neat. Think about all the action figures we've bought over the years. It would be kind of cool to have ones that look like us. Don't you think?",6,Big Bang Theory,156,31
29019,Penny,14," Yeah, if that's your idea of what's cool, you should get one.",6,Big Bang Theory,62,12
29020,Leonard,14," Yeah, so, I'm out.",6,Big Bang Theory,19,4
29021,Raj,14," What do you think, Sheldon? Want an action figure that looks just like you?",6,Big Bang Theory,76,14
29022,Sheldon,14, Would it come with Kung-Fu grip?,6,Big Bang Theory,33,6
29023,Raj,14, No.,6,Big Bang Theory,4,1
29024,Sheldon,14, Don't waste my time.,6,Big Bang Theory,21,4
29025,Leonard,14, You get that these are personalised action figures.,6,Big Bang Theory,52,8
29026,Penny,14," Honey, if you want one, just get one.",6,Big Bang Theory,38,8
29027,Howard,14," You're still out, right?",6,Big Bang Theory,25,4
29028,Leonard,14, Yep.,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
29030,Sheldon,14," A hush falls over the crowd as Cooper studies the board. He makes his move. He's dividing both sides by I. He's adding back the coefficient. He has a value for P. He's plugging that back in. He takes the derivative, and he solves the equation. The crowd goes wild. Nobel! Nobel!",6,Big Bang Theory,279,52
29032,Sheldon,14, Nobel. Kripke. Don't look at my board.,6,Big Bang Theory,39,7
29034,Sheldon,14," That's a drawing of a really cool train. Don't look at that, either. What do you want?",6,Big Bang Theory,87,17
29036,Sheldon,14," So they asked you to pack up your things and ship out. That's hard cheese, Barry. You're one of the good ones.",6,Big Bang Theory,111,22
29038,Sheldon,14, That's ridiculous. I am one of the great minds of our generation. I work on a level so rarified you couldn't even imagine it. I said stop looking at my cool train!,6,Big Bang Theory,164,32
29040,Leonard,14, Hmm. Kind of a strange place to put a picture of you and Bernadette.,6,Big Bang Theory,69,14
29041,Howard,14," Well, I wanted everybody to know I love my wife. And nobody to know I forgot to turn off the laser.",6,Big Bang Theory,100,21
29042,Raj,14, They're here. Our action figures have arrived. This is the best five hundred dollars I've ever spent.,6,Big Bang Theory,102,17
29043,Leonard,14, A thousand dollars on action figures? How can you afford that?,6,Big Bang Theory,63,11
29044,Howard,14," Easy. His family's loaded, and Bernadette has a great job. My wife came with both fun bags and money bags.",6,Big Bang Theory,107,20
29045,Raj,14," Say hello to an exact scale model of me. Oh, I'm not dark chocolate. I'm melt-in-your-mouth caramel.",6,Big Bang Theory,101,17
29046,Howard,14," Oh, man. Look at my nose.",6,Big Bang Theory,26,6
29047,Leonard,14, Maybe it's a shipping problem.,6,Big Bang Theory,31,5
29048,Howard,14, What?,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
29049,Leonard,14, Yeah. Maybe Wesley Snipes and Toucan Sam just got action figures that look like you guys.,6,Big Bang Theory,90,16
29050,Raj,14, This sucks.,6,Big Bang Theory,12,2
29051,Howard,14, I can't believe I wasted all that money.,6,Big Bang Theory,41,8
29052,Leonard,14," Aw, and my girlfriend wouldn't let me get one. Look at my face. Do I look smug? I feel smug.",6,Big Bang Theory,93,20
29054,Penny,14, I hate it when you make me sit through all the credits.,6,Big Bang Theory,56,12
29055,Leonard,14," Well, sometimes there's a secret ending, like in The Avengers.",6,Big Bang Theory,63,10
29056,Penny,14," Yeah, but I don't think that's going to happen in a documentary about the Holocaust.",6,Big Bang Theory,85,15
29057,Leonard,14," They could show bloopers. Oh, no.",6,Big Bang Theory,34,6
29058,Penny,14, What is that?,6,Big Bang Theory,14,3
29059,Leonard,14," That is Sheldon's â€œI'm unhappy and about to destroy the planetâ€ù music. Come on, let's just go to your place.",6,Big Bang Theory,113,20
29060,Penny,14," Well, wait, if he's unhappy,shouldn't we talk to him?",6,Big Bang Theory,54,9
29061,Leonard,14, Shouldn't we talk to him? Have you learned nothing in six years?,6,Big Bang Theory,65,12
29062,Penny,14," You doing okay, sweetie?",6,Big Bang Theory,25,4
29063,Sheldon,14," There is ominous music playing, and there is an afghan over my head. I don't know where you're from, but where I'm from, that means I'm not doing okay.",6,Big Bang Theory,152,29
29064,Leonard,14, Want me to make you some tea?,6,Big Bang Theory,30,7
29065,Sheldon,14, Tea is for when I'm upset. I'm not upset. The university's forcing me to work with Kripke. I'm outraged.,6,Big Bang Theory,105,19
29066,Leonard,14," So, cocoa?",6,Big Bang Theory,11,2
29067,Sheldon,14," Yes, cocoa. Do you have any idea what it's like to be paired with someone who's so incredibly annoying?",6,Big Bang Theory,104,19
29068,Leonard,14," Oh, teacher! Me! Me!",6,Big Bang Theory,21,4
29069,Sheldon,14," See, I did all this great work, and now he's just going to come along and ruin it. I am angrier than ever and filled with despair.",6,Big Bang Theory,131,27
29070,Penny,14, What beverage do you make for that?,6,Big Bang Theory,36,7
29071,Leonard,14," Oh, no, no, no, I know this. Uh, hot apple cider with cinnamon sticks?",6,Big Bang Theory,71,14
29072,Sheldon,14," Yes, hot apple cider with cinnamon sticks!",6,Big Bang Theory,43,7
29075,Sheldon,14," And yet, now you're in my office. Point, Cooper. Welcome to the Thunderdome, Kripke.",6,Big Bang Theory,85,14
29077,Sheldon,14, Why don't you show me yours first.,6,Big Bang Theory,35,7
29079,Sheldon,14, How do I know you're not going to take my ideas and publish them as your own?,6,Big Bang Theory,78,17
29081,Sheldon,14," Because I'm not interested in getting published in Mad magazine. Zingers fly fast in the Thunderdome, Barry.",6,Big Bang Theory,109,17
29083,Sheldon,14, Fine.,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
29085,Sheldon,14, And I am sure it's still more valuable than whatever's in here.,6,Big Bang Theory,64,12
29087,Sheldon,14, Very well.,6,Big Bang Theory,11,2
29089,Sheldon,14, Fine.,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
29091,Raj,14, You! Always bet on black.,6,Big Bang Theory,26,5
29092,Howard,14, Get that waste of money out of my face.,6,Big Bang Theory,40,9
29093,Raj,14," It's only a waste of money if we don't play with them.  He's right, dawg.",6,Big Bang Theory,74,15
29094,Howard,14," Please, I'm working.",6,Big Bang Theory,21,3
29095,Raj,14," You know, there is a way we can get action figures to look exactly like us.",6,Big Bang Theory,76,16
29096,Howard,14," Oh, yeah? How's that?",6,Big Bang Theory,22,4
29097,Raj,14," Two words, 3-D printer. Wait, maybe it's three words. No, hang on. Okay, one word, a letter and a number and maybe a hyphen. 3-D printer.",6,Big Bang Theory,138,26
29098,Howard,14, I have always wanted a 3-D printer.,6,Big Bang Theory,36,7
29099,Raj,14," Of course you have. They're an engineer's dream. Anything you can design, a 3-D printer can make out of plastic.",6,Big Bang Theory,113,20
29100,Howard,14," Yeah, but they're so expensive.",6,Big Bang Theory,32,5
29101,Raj,14," Oh, come on. You deserve one. You've worked hard to find a woman who makes a lot of money.",6,Big Bang Theory,91,19
29102,Howard,14," Well, the prices have been coming down.",6,Big Bang Theory,40,7
29103,Raj,14," Oh, true. They're practically giving them away. You know, in exchange for money.",6,Big Bang Theory,81,13
29104,Howard,14," And we can make stuff we need for work with it. Prototypes of my CAD/CAM designs, specialized tools",6,Big Bang Theory,100,18
29105,Raj,14, Not to mention Malibu Koothrappali and his totally bitchin' dream house.,6,Big Bang Theory,73,11
29106,Howard,14, We don't need Malibu Koothrappali's dream house.,6,Big Bang Theory,49,7
29107,Raj,14," Really, smart guy? Where's he supposed to park his sweet little Corvette?",6,Big Bang Theory,74,12
29109,Amy,14,"The monkey in my tobacco study has taken to smoking a pipe. I'm supposed to remove his brain to examine, but it's hard because now he reminds me of my uncle. You've been awfully quiet tonight. Is everything okay?",6,Big Bang Theory,212,39
29110,Sheldon,14, I'm fine.,6,Big Bang Theory,10,2
29111,Amy,14," All right, well, how was work today? Did you exchange your research with Kripke?",6,Big Bang Theory,81,14
29112,Sheldon,14, Yes.,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
29113,Amy,14," Sheldon, what's going on?",6,Big Bang Theory,26,4
29114,Sheldon,14," I read his research, and, it's leaps and bounds ahead of mine. Which means the mommy of the smartest physicist at the university is not my mommy as I had thought. It's his mommy.",6,Big Bang Theory,179,34
29115,Amy,14," Sheldon, I wish there was something I could do to make you feel better. May I offer you a consoling hug?",6,Big Bang Theory,105,21
29116,Sheldon,14, What do we have to lose?,6,Big Bang Theory,25,6
29117,Amy,14, How's that?,6,Big Bang Theory,12,2
29118,Sheldon,14, I feel like I'm being strangled by a boa constrictor. Why'd you stop?,6,Big Bang Theory,70,13
29120,Leonard,14," Come on, Sheldon, we're going to be late.",6,Big Bang Theory,42,8
29121,Sheldon,14, I can't go in today. I'm sick.,6,Big Bang Theory,31,7
29122,Leonard,14, You're not sick. You just don't want to face Kripke.,6,Big Bang Theory,53,10
29123,Sheldon,14," No, look.",6,Big Bang Theory,10,2
29124,Leonard,14,128,6,Big Bang Theory,3,1
29125,Sheldon,14, See?,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
29126,Leonard,14," What did you do, put this in your tea?",6,Big Bang Theory,39,9
29127,Sheldon,14," Oh, dear. Now I'm not even smarter than you.",6,Big Bang Theory,45,9
29128,Leonard,14," Sheldon, Kripke's not smarter than you. You just got stuck on a wrong path. Happened to Einstein. He got stuck on the unified field theory for decades.",6,Big Bang Theory,152,27
29129,Sheldon,14," Oh, don't play the Einstein card. His great breakthroughs happened when no one knew anything. So everything was a great breakthrough.",6,Big Bang Theory,134,21
29130,Leonard,14," Sheldon Lee Cooper, I do not have time for this nonsense. Now, go put your clothes on, get in the car, and lets go to work.",6,Big Bang Theory,124,26
29131,Sheldon,14," All right, geez. What a grouch.",6,Big Bang Theory,32,6
29132,Leonard,14, How did I do that? I got to remember how I did that.,6,Big Bang Theory,53,13
29134,Howard,14," Do you realize, by owning a 3-D printer, we are reclaiming the manufacturing process and taking jobs back from sweatshops in China?",6,Big Bang Theory,132,22
29135,Raj,14, I think this thing was made in China.,6,Big Bang Theory,38,8
29136,Howard,14," Eh, what can you do?",6,Big Bang Theory,21,5
29137,Raj,14," Ooh, I, I think it's done. Oh, it worked. We printed a whistle.",6,Big Bang Theory,64,13
29138,Howard,14, Amazing. You realize these things go for 25 cents a pop at a party store.,6,Big Bang Theory,74,15
29139,Raj,14, And we made it in only three hours. Sounds just like store-bought.,6,Big Bang Theory,67,12
29140,Howard,14," Okay, give me a superhero pose, and I will scan you into the computer for your action figure.",6,Big Bang Theory,94,18
29141,Raj,14," Oh, I wish I was in better shape.",6,Big Bang Theory,34,8
29142,Howard,14, Stop holding your stomach in. I'll give you a six-pack with the computer.,6,Big Bang Theory,74,13
29143,Raj,14," Oh, okay, great. Now I can look like Val Kilmer as Batman instead of Val Kilmer as he looks today.",6,Big Bang Theory,99,20
29144,Howard,14," All right, you can suck it in a little bit.",6,Big Bang Theory,44,10
29147,Sheldon,14," I know. Go ahead, mock me. Just use small words so I understand.",6,Big Bang Theory,65,13
29149,Sheldon,14, We do?,6,Big Bang Theory,7,2
29151,Sheldon,14, So?,6,Big Bang Theory,4,1
29153,Sheldon,14, Yes. That is the reason. My work is suffering because of all the laid I'm getting.,6,Big Bang Theory,83,16
29155,Sheldon,14," What can I say, you know? She enjoys my genitals. I am giving them to her on a nightly basis.",6,Big Bang Theory,94,20
29157,Sheldon,14," I'll do what I can. But it's not going to be easy, because when I'm with Amy and our bathing suit areas mush together, boy howdy, is it magic",6,Big Bang Theory,142,29
29159,Howard,14," Oh, good, you're home. Got a little surprise for you.",6,Big Bang Theory,54,10
29161,Howard,14, Say hello to my little friend.,6,Big Bang Theory,31,6
29163,Howard,14," I know, right? And, thanks to photographs and a little 3-D modeling, here comes the bride.",6,Big Bang Theory,91,16
29165,Howard,14, I thought you might.,6,Big Bang Theory,21,4
29167,Howard,14, Didn't cost a thing. I made them myself.,6,Big Bang Theory,41,8
29169,Howard,14," Koothrappali and I bought a used 3-D printer for $5,000.",6,Big Bang Theory,57,10
29171,Howard,14, Not just for a couple of dolls. For as many dolls as we want. And whistles.,6,Big Bang Theory,76,16
29173,Howard,14, It's kind of dawning on me now.,6,Big Bang Theory,32,7
29175,Howard,14, What are you talking about? We make plenty of money.,6,Big Bang Theory,53,10
29177,Howard,14," Yes, but we're married now. That means, when you get sick, I take care of you. And when you make a bunch of money, I get to buy stuff. Sorry if you don't like it, but that's how love works.",6,Big Bang Theory,190,40
29180,Penny,14," All right, I don't understand. Why didn't you just tell Kripke the truth?",6,Big Bang Theory,74,13
29181,Sheldon,14," Because the truth made me look bad, whereas a ridiculous bald-faced lie makes me look good. Anyway, if Kripke asks, tell him my coitus with Amy is frequent, intense and whimsically inventive.",6,Big Bang Theory,192,32
29182,Leonard,14, Is my coitus whimsically inventive?,6,Big Bang Theory,36,5
29183,Penny,14," That is what I write on the bathroom walls. For a whimsically inventive time, call Leonard Hofstadter.",6,Big Bang Theory,103,17
29184,Leonard,14," I know you're joking, but I'd be okay with that.",6,Big Bang Theory,49,10
29185,Penny,14," Yeah. Sheldon, can I ask you a question?",6,Big Bang Theory,41,8
29186,Sheldon,14, Of course.,6,Big Bang Theory,11,2
29187,Penny,14, You ever going to sleep with Amy?,6,Big Bang Theory,34,7
29188,Sheldon,14, That's awfully personal.,6,Big Bang Theory,25,3
29189,Leonard,14, We don't ask Sheldon things like that.,6,Big Bang Theory,39,7
29190,Penny,14," Maybe you don't, I do. What's the deal?",6,Big Bang Theory,40,8
29191,Sheldon,14," Well, word around the university is I'm giving her sex organs a proper jostling.",6,Big Bang Theory,81,14
29192,Penny,14," All right, come on, be serious. Look, you guys have been going out a long time. She would clearly like to have a physical relationship with you, so what are you doing?",6,Big Bang Theory,168,32
29193,Leonard,14," All right, we're down the rabbit hole. What are you doing?",6,Big Bang Theory,59,11
29194,Sheldon,14," Well, first of all, I'm quite fond of Amy.",6,Big Bang Theory,43,9
29195,Penny,14, Then what's the problem?,6,Big Bang Theory,25,4
29196,Sheldon,14," Penny, all my life, I have been uncomfortable with the sort of physical contact that comes easily to others, hand-shaking, hugging, prostate exams. But I'm working on it, you know? Just recently, I had to put VapoRub on Amy's chest. A year ago, that would have been unthinkable.",6,Big Bang Theory,279,48
29197,Leonard,14, Now you know how I feel when I have to put it on you.,6,Big Bang Theory,54,14
29198,Penny,14, Okay. Hang on. Are you saying someday you and Amy might actually get physical?,6,Big Bang Theory,79,14
29199,Sheldon,14, It's a possibility.,6,Big Bang Theory,20,3
29200,Penny,14," Oh, my God!  Sheldon, I know this wasn't easy for you, and I'm really glad we could have this conversation.",6,Big Bang Theory,108,20
29201,Sheldon,14, Fine.,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
29202,Penny,14," Oh, my God!",6,Big Bang Theory,12,3
29203,Leonard,14, Ow!,6,Big Bang Theory,4,1
29205,Raj,14, Are you sure you want to do this? Give up your half of the 3-D printer?,6,Big Bang Theory,72,16
29206,Howard,14, Yes. And can you please make that out to Bernadette? I was taken off the joint account until I learn the value of money.,6,Big Bang Theory,121,24
29207,Raj,14," Wow, that's harsh.",6,Big Bang Theory,19,3
29208,Howard,14, Tell me about it.,6,Big Bang Theory,18,4
29209,Raj,14, Aren't you gonna eat lunch?,6,Big Bang Theory,28,5
29210,Howard,14," Nah, I blew my food allowance on Pokemon cards.",6,Big Bang Theory,48,9
29212,Sheldon,14," Well, the equation balances, but it's certainly not elegant.",6,Big Bang Theory,61,9
29214,Sheldon,14, Yes.,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
29216,Sheldon,14," No, I gave it to her well. Now, over here, I was thinking the turbulence could be reduced if we just put",6,Big Bang Theory,105,22
29218,Sheldon,14, I didn't notice.,6,Big Bang Theory,17,3
29220,Sheldon,14, I was too busy squishing all the desirable parts of her body.,6,Big Bang Theory,62,12
29222,Sheldon,14, Can we get back to work?,6,Big Bang Theory,25,6
29224,Sheldon,14, Toys? I do have a model rocket next to my bed.,6,Big Bang Theory,47,11
29227,Leonard,15, I don't know why I avoided the Harry Potter books for so long. These are great. I just started number six.,6,Big Bang Theory,107,21
29228,Sheldon,15," That's a good one. Dumbledore dies in that one. Yeah, I know, I didn't see it coming, either.",6,Big Bang Theory,94,18
29229,Leonard,15, Why would you say that?,6,Big Bang Theory,24,5
29230,Sheldon,15," You brought up the subject. I contributed an interesting fact on that subject. It's called the art of conversation. Okay, your turn.",6,Big Bang Theory,133,22
29231,Leonard,15, That was a huge spoiler.,6,Big Bang Theory,25,5
29232,Sheldon,15, Good.,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
29233,Leonard,15," What is wrong with you? If I did that, you'd bitch about it for weeks.",6,Big Bang Theory,71,15
29234,Sheldon,15," Oh, really, Leonard? Are you going to have another one of your hissy fits?",6,Big Bang Theory,75,14
29235,Leonard,15, Hissy fits? I have hissy fits?,6,Big Bang Theory,31,6
29236,Sheldon,15," Yes, and I have a theory why. Because of your lactose intolerance, you switched over to soy milk. Soy contains estrogen-mimicking compounds. I think your morning Cocoa Puffs are turning you into a hysterical woman.",6,Big Bang Theory,215,35
29237,Leonard,15," You are unbelievable. I don't know why I put up with you. You're controlling, you're irritating.",6,Big Bang Theory,97,16
29238,Sheldon,15," There you go again, nag, nag, nag. You're only proving my point, little lady.",6,Big Bang Theory,78,14
29239,Leonard,15," You know what? Screw you, Sheldon. You are the most annoying person I have ever met.",6,Big Bang Theory,85,16
29240,Sheldon,15," What? I'm annoying? You criticize my behaviour all the time. Sheldon, don't talk about your bowel movements over breakfast. Sheldon, when the president of the university is giving a eulogy at a funeral, don't yawn and point at your watch. Sheldon, don't throw away my shirts 'cause you think they're ugly. You're impossible.",6,Big Bang Theory,325,53
29241,Leonard,15," That's it. I don't, I don't have to put up with this.",6,Big Bang Theory,54,12
29242,Sheldon,15," Actually, I have your signature on a roommate agreement that says you do.",6,Big Bang Theory,74,13
29243,Leonard,15, Aw. Here's what I think of your roommate agreement.,6,Big Bang Theory,52,9
29244,Sheldon,15, You pick that up right now.,6,Big Bang Theory,28,6
29245,Leonard,15, No.,6,Big Bang Theory,4,1
29246,Sheldon,15," Roommate agreement, section 27, paragraph 5, the roommate agreement, like the American flag, cannot touch the ground.",6,Big Bang Theory,118,17
29247,Leonard,15, I don't care. I don't have to do anything you say because I don't think I want to live here anymore.,6,Big Bang Theory,101,21
29248,Sheldon,15, Where are you going?,6,Big Bang Theory,21,4
29249,Leonard,15," To live with Penny and not you, you crazy bastard.",6,Big Bang Theory,51,10
29250,Sheldon,15, Crazy bastard?,6,Big Bang Theory,15,2
29251,Leonard,15, Yes.,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
29252,Sheldon,15," Leonard, wait.",6,Big Bang Theory,15,2
29253,Leonard,15, What?,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
29254,Sheldon,15, Dobby the elf dies in book seven.,6,Big Bang Theory,34,7
29256,Raj,15, Here you go.,6,Big Bang Theory,13,3
29257,Howard,15, Great. Come on in.,6,Big Bang Theory,19,4
29258,Raj,15," What, you don't say thank you?",6,Big Bang Theory,31,6
29259,Howard,15, It's my suitcase. I lent it to you two years ago.,6,Big Bang Theory,50,11
29260,Raj,15," Well, then, I should tell you I broke the wheel and the handle. So, is everyone from Bernadette's company going to Vegas?",6,Big Bang Theory,122,22
29261,Howard,15," No, just me, her and a couple of the big wigs. It's part of a bonus she got.",6,Big Bang Theory,77,18
29262,Raj,15, Cool. Did she discover a cure for something?,6,Big Bang Theory,45,8
29263,Howard,15, Not exactly. They spent a ton of money developing this dandruff medication that had the side effect of horrible anal leakage.,6,Big Bang Theory,126,21
29264,Raj,15, Is there a good anal leakage?,6,Big Bang Theory,30,6
29265,Howard,15," Anyway, it was Bernie's idea to rebrand the stuff as a cure for constipation.",6,Big Bang Theory,78,14
29266,Raj,15," Way to make lemonade. You know, from around the corner where fudge is made.",6,Big Bang Theory,76,14
29267,Howard,15," Hey, I got a favour to ask.",6,Big Bang Theory,28,7
29268,Raj,15, Sure.,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
29269,Howard,15, My mom's been kind of an emotional wreck since that dentist she was dating dumped her.,6,Big Bang Theory,87,16
29270,Raj,15," Dumped her? What, did he use a forklift? Sorry. There's nothing funny about morbid obesity.",6,Big Bang Theory,92,15
29271,Howard,15," She's huge. It was funny. Anyway, I was just hoping that maybe you could check in on her tomorrow night and make sure she's doing okay.",6,Big Bang Theory,136,26
29272,Raj,15," Dude, I'm a single man. Saturday night is my party night.",6,Big Bang Theory,58,11
29273,Howard,15, Really? What do you got going on?,6,Big Bang Theory,34,7
29274,Raj,15," I don't know, maybe drive down to Hollywood, hit a few hot spots, see if I can get lucky.",6,Big Bang Theory,90,19
29275,Howard,15," Yeah, tell me if this sounds familiar. You pay fifteen dollars to park, you stand on the pavement for an hour until you break down and give the bouncer twenty bucks to let you in. You push your way to the bar, where you drink an eighteen dollar cosmopolitan, then you stare at a pretty girl and imagine your perfect life together. Your children, grandchildren. Meanwhile, she leaves with a guy who claims he wrote Beverly Hills Chihuahua. Then you give up on anyone ever loving you, go to Marie Callender's, buy a pie and eat it in your car in the parking lot.",6,Big Bang Theory,561,104
29276,Raj,15,What time should I be at your mother's?,6,Big Bang Theory,39,8
29277,Howard,15, I told her around seven.,6,Big Bang Theory,25,5
29279,Leonard,15," I swear, that man is the most egotistical, insufferable human being I have ever met.",6,Big Bang Theory,85,15
29280,Penny,15," Yeah, but you two make such a cute couple. Like Burt and Ernie. You guys even teach me stuff about words and numbers.",6,Big Bang Theory,118,23
29281,Leonard,15," Well, I've had it. I am done. I can't, I can't live with him for one more minute.",6,Big Bang Theory,82,18
29282,Penny,15, Wow. Where are you going to go?,6,Big Bang Theory,32,7
29283,Leonard,15, I was thinking here with you.,6,Big Bang Theory,30,6
29284,Penny,15, Oh.,6,Big Bang Theory,4,1
29285,Leonard,15, That a problem?,6,Big Bang Theory,16,3
29286,Penny,15," No, not at all. No, it's, it's great. It's terrific. I, you know, I just can't help feel bad about Sheldon. I mean, how's he going to get by without you? Ernie.",6,Big Bang Theory,161,32
29287,Leonard,15, He's got Amy now.,6,Big Bang Theory,18,4
29288,Penny,15," Yeah, he does, but it's not the same.",6,Big Bang Theory,38,8
29289,Leonard,15, Why?,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
29290,Penny,15," Um, well, um, all right. You, you know how in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Ron didn't abandon Harry just because Harry started dating Ron's sister?",6,Big Bang Theory,159,27
29291,Leonard,15, Harry and Ginny get together?,6,Big Bang Theory,30,5
29292,Penny,15," Sorry. Spoiler alert. My point is, as much as I want to live with you, I can't do it knowing how much Sheldon needs you.",6,Big Bang Theory,121,25
29293,Leonard,15," Please, the only thing he needs me for is to be his whipping boy, his, his stooge, his doormat.",6,Big Bang Theory,96,19
29294,Penny,15," Well, you know what they say, if it ain't broke.",6,Big Bang Theory,49,10
29295,Leonard,15, Wow. It sounds to me like you don't want us to live together.,6,Big Bang Theory,62,13
29296,Penny,15," No. No, no, I do. I do. It's just, I mean, it's a really big step.",6,Big Bang Theory,67,16
29297,Leonard,15," Is it? We're together all the time. Financially, it makes great sense. Can you think of one reason why we shouldn't do this?",6,Big Bang Theory,125,23
29298,Penny,15," Well, um, I'm just a little thirsty.",6,Big Bang Theory,37,7
29299,Leonard,15, Yeah.,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
29300,Penny,15, I got nothing.,6,Big Bang Theory,15,3
29301,Leonard,15, Great. I'll go get my stuff.,6,Big Bang Theory,29,6
29302,Penny,15," Yeah. Okay, all right, don't freak out. You can make this work.",6,Big Bang Theory,64,12
29303,Leonard,15," Oh, could you clear off a shelf for me in the bathroom? I take a lot of medicine.",6,Big Bang Theory,82,18
29304,Penny,15," Oh, please let some of it be Xanax.",6,Big Bang Theory,36,8
29307,Raj,15," No, thank you, Mrs. Wolowitz. As it is, I'm going to have to carry my stomach out of here like I'm a fireman rescuing an infant.",6,Big Bang Theory,129,26
29309,Raj,15," Well, I, I really couldn't. But, uh, I've had a lovely time eating your brisket and hearing about the things you've had removed from your body over the years. Didn't know you could have a cyst inside another cyst.",6,Big Bang Theory,214,39
29311,Raj,15," That would be lovely. Thank you.  Mrs. Wolowitz, uh, are you okay?",6,Big Bang Theory,67,12
29313,Raj,15," I, uh, I suppose I could stay for some dessert.",6,Big Bang Theory,48,10
29315,Raj,15, Sure.,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
29318,Sheldon,15, One vintage Mr. Mxyzptlk action figure. That's Leonard's.,6,Big Bang Theory,58,8
29319,Amy,15, Children's toy.,6,Big Bang Theory,16,2
29320,Amy,15, Children's toy.,6,Big Bang Theory,16,2
29321,Sheldon,15," One Game of Thrones collector's edition Longclaw sword. Oh, Leonard and I bought that together. That's a bit of an ethical conundrum. Eh, I'll keep it.",6,Big Bang Theory,152,26
29322,Amy,15," So, uh, what's your plan moving forward?",6,Big Bang Theory,41,7
29323,Sheldon,15," Uh, suppose I'll have to find and cultivate a new roommate. What a task that will be. Do you know how uncivilized Leonard was when I took him in?",6,Big Bang Theory,146,29
29324,Amy,15, No.,6,Big Bang Theory,4,1
29325,Sheldon,15," Oh, it took me forever to get him on a bathroom schedule. He would just go whenever the mood struck him.",6,Big Bang Theory,105,21
29326,Amy,15, Like a dog-boy.,6,Big Bang Theory,16,3
29327,Sheldon,15, Exactly.,6,Big Bang Theory,9,1
29328,Amy,15, What if you could find a roommate who was a scientist and already familiar and comfortable with your ways?,6,Big Bang Theory,107,19
29329,Sheldon,15," That would be ideal. If a person like that existed, I would sign on, no further questions asked.",6,Big Bang Theory,97,18
29330,Amy,15, Great. Here I am!,6,Big Bang Theory,18,4
29331,Sheldon,15, Wait. Here who is where?,6,Big Bang Theory,25,5
29332,Amy,15, Me. Aren't I your perfect roommate?,6,Big Bang Theory,36,6
29333,Sheldon,15, Um,6,Big Bang Theory,3,1
29334,Amy,15," Think about it, Sheldon. I'm not a stranger, we're intellectually compatible, I'm willing to chauffeur you around town, and your personality quirks, which others find abhorrent or rage-inducing, I find cute as a button. What do you think?",6,Big Bang Theory,239,38
29335,Sheldon,15, Um,6,Big Bang Theory,3,1
29336,Amy,15, Tell me one reason why this isn't a fantastic idea.,6,Big Bang Theory,52,10
29337,Sheldon,15, Um,6,Big Bang Theory,3,1
29338,Amy,15, See? You can't. I'm gonna go see if Leonard's room is big enough for my water bed.,6,Big Bang Theory,83,17
29339,Sheldon,15, Um,6,Big Bang Theory,3,1
29341,Sheldon,15,  Good buddy Leonard.  Good buddy Leonard.  Good buddy Leonard.,6,Big Bang Theory,63,9
29342,Leonard,15, What do you want?,6,Big Bang Theory,18,4
29343,Sheldon,15," Hey, good buddy. So, uh, I was just talking to Amy, and she made me realize that this little dust-up between you and me is much ado about nothing.",6,Big Bang Theory,147,29
29344,Leonard,15, Is that so?,6,Big Bang Theory,12,3
29345,Sheldon,15," Yes. All is forgiven, so come back home. I'll make you some soy hot chocolate, and then I'll you tell you about our exciting new devil-may-care bathroom policy.",6,Big Bang Theory,161,28
29346,Leonard,15," Cut to the chase, Sheldon.",6,Big Bang Theory,27,5
29347,Sheldon,15," Okay. Amy's decided she wants to move in with me, so I need you to come back home, you lovable scamp. That's a lot of product.",6,Big Bang Theory,127,26
29348,Penny,15, Hey. What's going on?,6,Big Bang Theory,22,4
29349,Leonard,15," Oh, get this, suddenly, Sheldon wants me back because Amy wants to move in with him.",6,Big Bang Theory,85,16
29350,Penny,15, Really? Interesting.,6,Big Bang Theory,21,2
29351,Leonard,15," Well, too late, pal. I'm not going anywhere. Penny and I are very happy living together. Isn't that right?",6,Big Bang Theory,107,19
29352,Penny,15, It's like the happiness won't ever leave the apartment.,6,Big Bang Theory,56,9
29353,Sheldon,15," Leonard, please. You know Amy moving in marks a level of intimacy our relationship isn't ready for.",6,Big Bang Theory,100,17
29354,Penny,15," Yes. That is a real thing. And it doesn't mean you don't care about each other, it just means things are moving at a pace you're not comfortable with, and that's fine.",6,Big Bang Theory,168,32
29355,Leonard,15," Well, if he doesn't want to live with her, then he should tell her how he feels.",6,Big Bang Theory,81,17
29356,Penny,15," Well, maybe he doesn't know how to say it without hurting her feelings.",6,Big Bang Theory,72,13
29357,Sheldon,15," Feelings? What am I, a hippie at a love-in? No. The problem is, she laid out a series of logical arguments that I couldn't refute.",6,Big Bang Theory,131,25
29358,Penny,15," That is the worst, isn't it?",6,Big Bang Theory,29,6
29359,Sheldon,15, Yes.,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
29360,Leonard,15," I'm sorry, Sheldon. I can't help you. Oh, spoiler alert, this door's about to slam in your face.",6,Big Bang Theory,97,18
29361,Amy,15," Oh, there you are. When do I get a key to our apartment?",6,Big Bang Theory,57,13
29362,Sheldon,15, Um,6,Big Bang Theory,3,1
29364,Raj,15, Hello?,6,Big Bang Theory,7,1
29365,Howard,15, Hey. How'd it go last night with my mom?,6,Big Bang Theory,41,9
29366,Raj,15," Okay, I guess.",6,Big Bang Theory,15,3
29367,Howard,15, What time did you leave?,6,Big Bang Theory,25,5
29368,Raj,15," Actually, I'm still here.",6,Big Bang Theory,26,4
29369,Howard,15, What? You spent the night?,6,Big Bang Theory,27,5
29370,Raj,15," Yeah. Uh, after dinner, we watched a rerun of Rockford Files, and then she opened a bottle of, uh, cream sherry, and the next thing I know, she was tucking me into your bed.",6,Big Bang Theory,174,34
29371,Howard,15, You wore my pyjamas?,6,Big Bang Theory,21,4
29372,Raj,15," Mm-hmm. How do you sleep in these things? Silk pajamas on satin sheets? I slid out of the bed, like, three times.",6,Big Bang Theory,114,22
29374,Raj,15," Oh, boy. Breakfast.",6,Big Bang Theory,20,3
29375,Howard,15," Okay, Raj, listen to me. You need to get out of there.",6,Big Bang Theory,55,12
29376,Raj,15, But I have a cream sherry hangover and I smell blintzes.,6,Big Bang Theory,57,11
29377,Howard,15," If you don't leave now, she'll use food and guilt to keep you there for the rest of your life.",6,Big Bang Theory,95,20
29378,Raj,15," Oh, Howard, stop.",6,Big Bang Theory,18,3
29379,Howard,15," Trust me, you're not Jewish. That's how they get you.",6,Big Bang Theory,54,10
29380,Raj,15, You're being silly. I can leave whenever I want.,6,Big Bang Theory,49,9
29381,Howard,15," Oh, really? Where are your clothes and your shoes?",6,Big Bang Theory,51,9
29382,Raj,15," They're on the chair, right over Oy vey.",6,Big Bang Theory,41,8
29384,Sheldon,15," Hello, home wrecker.",6,Big Bang Theory,21,3
29385,Penny,15, What did I do?,6,Big Bang Theory,15,4
29386,Sheldon,15," You gave Leonard somewhere to go. Thanks to you, Amy's out buying his and hers bath towels. Like I'd ever dry myself with something that has a possessive pronoun on it.",6,Big Bang Theory,169,31
29387,Penny,15," Okay. Listen, the truth is I don't want him living with me.",6,Big Bang Theory,60,12
29388,Sheldon,15, Great. Kick him out. Break his heart. Everybody wins.,6,Big Bang Theory,54,9
29389,Penny,15," No, I don't want to break his heart. I love him. This is just happening too fast.",6,Big Bang Theory,82,17
29390,Sheldon,15, You think this is fast? It's just a matter of time before I see Amy's leg stubble in my shower.,6,Big Bang Theory,96,20
29391,Penny,15," Yeah, and I've seen those legs. You might want to get some Drano.",6,Big Bang Theory,66,13
29392,Sheldon,15," Hold on. If you don't want to live with Leonard, why don't you just tell him?",6,Big Bang Theory,78,16
29393,Penny,15," Well, you know how he is. He's sensitive and emotional.",6,Big Bang Theory,56,10
29394,Sheldon,15, That's because he drinks too much soy milk.,6,Big Bang Theory,44,8
29395,Penny,15," Well, I don't know what else we can do but tell them the truth.",6,Big Bang Theory,64,14
29396,Sheldon,15," I suppose there's no choice but to face the crying, angry accusations and the high-pitched wails of despair.",6,Big Bang Theory,109,18
29397,Penny,15, Yeah. And who knows how Amy will react.,6,Big Bang Theory,40,8
29399,Howard,15, Here's some more ice.,6,Big Bang Theory,22,4
29401,Howard,15, What were we thinking? We should have just done it the regular way.,6,Big Bang Theory,68,13
29403,Howard,15," Honestly, if I could bend that far, what would I need with you?",6,Big Bang Theory,64,13
29405,Howard,15," Hey, Raj. What's up?",6,Big Bang Theory,21,4
29406,Raj,15, You were right. I can't get out of here.,6,Big Bang Theory,41,9
29407,Howard,15, You're still at my mother's?,6,Big Bang Theory,29,5
29408,Raj,15," I'm trapped. My clothes have been in the laundry all day, and she hid my keys. I think they might be in her bra, because she jingles when she walks. What do I do?",6,Big Bang Theory,163,34
29409,Howard,15," Hey, you wanted a woman in your life. Now you got one.",6,Big Bang Theory,55,12
29410,Raj,15," Come on, Howard, help me.",6,Big Bang Theory,26,5
29412,Raj,15," Oh, my God. She's not gonna bathe me, is she?",6,Big Bang Theory,46,10
29413,Howard,15," Gee, I wish I could tell you no. All right, well, thanks again for helping me out.",6,Big Bang Theory,83,17
29414,Raj,15," But, Howard",6,Big Bang Theory,12,2
29416,Howard,15, It's too late. We'll see him at his Bar Mitzvah.,6,Big Bang Theory,49,10
29418,Amy,15, Here you go. I picked up the Chinese food just the way Leonard used to.,6,Big Bang Theory,72,15
29419,Sheldon,15, Is it kung pao chicken?,6,Big Bang Theory,24,5
29420,Amy,15, Yes.,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
29421,Sheldon,15," Brown rice, not white rice?",6,Big Bang Theory,28,5
29422,Amy,15, Yes.,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
29423,Sheldon,15, Spicy mustard from the Korean deli?,6,Big Bang Theory,36,6
29424,Amy,15," Yes. I did good, right?",6,Big Bang Theory,24,5
29425,Sheldon,15," Yes. Amy, are you worried that us living together will take the mystery out of our relationship?",6,Big Bang Theory,97,17
29426,Amy,15, No.,6,Big Bang Theory,4,1
29427,Sheldon,15," Yeah, why would you?",6,Big Bang Theory,21,4
29428,Amy,15," Oh, and, uh, check this out. I took the liberty of scripting a new outgoing voice mail message for both of us.",6,Big Bang Theory,111,22
29429,Sheldon,15, Hello. This is Sheldon.,6,Big Bang Theory,24,4
29430,Amy,15, And this is Amy.,6,Big Bang Theory,17,4
29431,Sheldon,15, We're not home right now.,6,Big Bang Theory,26,5
29432,Amy,15," â€˜Cause we out dropping science, son.",6,Big Bang Theory,39,6
29434,Amy,15, Beep.,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
29435,Sheldon,15, You can't live here.,6,Big Bang Theory,21,4
29436,Amy,15, What? Why? Is it the message? I only used urban slang to sound tough so people wouldn't break in.,6,Big Bang Theory,98,19
29437,Sheldon,15, No. It's not the message.,6,Big Bang Theory,26,5
29438,Amy,15," Well, what is it, then? I did everything just the way you like it.",6,Big Bang Theory,67,14
29439,Sheldon,15, You did.,6,Big Bang Theory,9,2
29440,Amy,15," Then what the hell, Sheldon? We have been going out for over two years, and I have been nothing but patient with you. I watch your dopey space movies. I signed your ridiculous contract. I even stopped wearing lip gloss 'cause you said it made my mouth look too slippery. I am the best girlfriend you're ever gonna have. You give me one good reason why I can't live here.",6,Big Bang Theory,371,70
29441,Sheldon,15, It's Penny's fault.,6,Big Bang Theory,20,3
29442,Amy,15, What?,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
29443,Sheldon,15," She doesn't want to live with Leonard, so he has to come live here again. She's the snake in our garden. She's the reason we can't be happy.",6,Big Bang Theory,141,28
29445,Penny,15," Hey, Ames.",6,Big Bang Theory,11,2
29446,Amy,15," Yeah. Hey, Ames, nothing. I was all set to move in with Sheldon, and now I hear I can't 'cause you don't want to live with Leonard.",6,Big Bang Theory,132,27
29447,Leonard,15, What?,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
29448,Penny,15," Sheldon, what did you say?",6,Big Bang Theory,27,5
29449,Sheldon,15," I said the truth. You don't want to live with Leonard, and you know it.",6,Big Bang Theory,72,15
29450,Leonard,15, Since when don't you want to live with me?,6,Big Bang Theory,43,9
29451,Penny,15," Oh, don't get all huffy. You're the one who decided to move in without even asking me if I was ready.",6,Big Bang Theory,102,21
29452,Sheldon,15," Yeah, I think we should talk about that.",6,Big Bang Theory,41,8
29453,Penny,15," And since you love the truth so much, why don't you tell Amy you don't want to live with her instead of blaming it on me?",6,Big Bang Theory,122,26
29454,Sheldon,15, I thought we were talking about the other thing.,6,Big Bang Theory,49,9
29455,Amy,15, You're a coward.,6,Big Bang Theory,17,3
29456,Sheldon,15," Well, the evidence does support that.",6,Big Bang Theory,38,6
29457,Penny,15," Come on, Amy, let's go drink wine and talk about what jerks our boyfriends are.",6,Big Bang Theory,80,15
29458,Amy,15, You know what would show them? I should move in here with you.,6,Big Bang Theory,63,13
29459,Penny,15, Um,6,Big Bang Theory,3,1
29460,Sheldon,15, Do you want to catch up on some Walking Dead?,6,Big Bang Theory,46,10
29461,Leonard,15, â€˜Kay.,6,Big Bang Theory,8,1
29462,Sheldon,15, Have you seen the one where Lori dies?,6,Big Bang Theory,39,8
29463,Leonard,15, No.,6,Big Bang Theory,4,1
29464,Sheldon,15, Or maybe she doesn't. Let's find out.,6,Big Bang Theory,38,7
29467,Raj,15, No!,6,Big Bang Theory,4,1
29469,Penny,16, You'll never believe what happened to me at work today.,6,Big Bang Theory,56,10
29470,Leonard,16, Hmm?,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
29471,Penny,16," This old guy was choking on his food, and I saved his life.",6,Big Bang Theory,60,13
29472,Leonard,16, You're kidding. Did you Heimlich him?,6,Big Bang Theory,38,6
29473,Penny,16," No. I said, oh, my God, I think that old guy's choking, and then one of the busboys Heimlich'ed him.",6,Big Bang Theory,101,20
29474,Leonard,16, You're a hero.,6,Big Bang Theory,15,3
29475,Penny,16," Yeah, that was the point of the story.",6,Big Bang Theory,39,8
29476,Leonard,16," Oh, yeah, speaking of work, do you know if you have Thursday night off?",6,Big Bang Theory,72,14
29477,Penny,16," Um, I think so. Why?",6,Big Bang Theory,21,5
29478,Leonard,16," What do you mean, why? It's Valentine's Day.",6,Big Bang Theory,45,8
29479,Penny,16," Oh, right. Yeah, we can do something.",6,Big Bang Theory,38,7
29480,Leonard,16, You could be a little more into it.,6,Big Bang Theory,36,8
29481,Penny,16," No, I'm into it, I'm into it. Just, there's so much pressure to make the night special, and it never works out.",6,Big Bang Theory,112,22
29482,Leonard,16," Okay, well, this time it's going to be different. Because I am like a romance ninja. You don't see it coming, and then bam, romance, watch out, hearts, kisses, love, ooh-ya!",6,Big Bang Theory,174,31
29483,Penny,16," You know, sometimes I think I've made you so much cooler than you used to be, and then you go and do that.",6,Big Bang Theory,107,23
29485,Sheldon,16," So, in conclusion, I believe the painful sensation felt after passing a meal of spicy chillies is proof that the rectum does possess the sense of taste.",6,Big Bang Theory,153,27
29486,Amy,16," I concur, but you changed the subject. What are we doing for Valentine's Day?",6,Big Bang Theory,78,14
29487,Sheldon,16," Oh, you caught that, did you?",6,Big Bang Theory,30,6
29489,Howard,16, Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay! Okay.,6,Big Bang Theory,36,6
29490,Raj,16, Everything okay?,6,Big Bang Theory,17,2
29491,Howard,16," Bernie's a little cranky since she's been working, like, 17 hours a day. And I've got a lot on my plate, too, because I've been busting my tail playing Assassin's Creed.",6,Big Bang Theory,170,31
29492,Raj,16," Hey, Stuart, you got anything going on for Valentine's Day?",6,Big Bang Theory,60,10
29494,Raj,16," Oh, well, I was going to spend the night with my special little lady, but, uh, she got worms, and then I had to take her to the vet.",6,Big Bang Theory,133,29
29496,Raj,16," Well, uh, how about you keep the store open late, and we throw a party for all the people who don't have dates?",6,Big Bang Theory,112,23
29497,Raj,16," Yeah, the theme will be that the greatest love a man can have is the love he has with himself.",6,Big Bang Theory,95,20
29500,Sheldon,16," Ah, Alex, excellent. I have a research problem that I believe you can help with.",6,Big Bang Theory,81,15
29502,Sheldon,16," Oh, no, no. That's not going to happen, no. What I need you to do is find a Valentine's gift for my girlfriend.",6,Big Bang Theory,112,23
29504,Sheldon,16," Well, I guess those chaps will have to have someone else buy their girlfriends presents. Now, here is, let's see, this is, this is about two thousand dollars, um, I think she likes monkeys and the colour grey. Contribute to my work. Ah, kids say the darnedest things.",6,Big Bang Theory,268,48
29506,Leonard,16," Hey, you coming to lunch?",6,Big Bang Theory,26,5
29507,Howard,16," Yeah, one second. Come here. I want to show you something.",6,Big Bang Theory,59,11
29508,Leonard,16, What you looking at?,6,Big Bang Theory,21,4
29509,Howard,16," Well, I was trying to come up with something really romantic to give Bernadette for Valentine's Day since she's been such a pain in the ass.",6,Big Bang Theory,141,26
29510,Leonard,16, You can't find a card that says that?,6,Big Bang Theory,38,8
29511,Howard,16, Check it out. I used the atomic force microscope in the material science lab and wrote our initials in a heart one one-thousandth the size of a grain of sand.,6,Big Bang Theory,159,30
29512,Leonard,16," Oh, that's cool.",6,Big Bang Theory,17,3
29513,Howard,16, A micro-valentine for a microbiologist.,6,Big Bang Theory,40,5
29514,Leonard,16, From her micro-husband. That is amazing. How long did this take you?,6,Big Bang Theory,69,12
29515,Howard,16," Mmm, about twelve hours. I pulled an all-nighter.",6,Big Bang Theory,50,8
29516,Leonard,16," Oh, wow.",6,Big Bang Theory,9,2
29517,Howard,16," Yeah, I know, it really took a bite out of my video game time. What are you and Penny doing?",6,Big Bang Theory,93,20
29518,Leonard,16," Oh, I'm going to take her to a nice restaurant for dinner.",6,Big Bang Theory,59,12
29519,Howard,16," Oh, that's not bad, but as far as romance goes, I think my gift hits it right out of ",6,Big Bang Theory,86,19
29520,Leonard,16, Want to come to dinner with us?,6,Big Bang Theory,32,7
29521,Howard,16," Yes, please.",6,Big Bang Theory,13,2
29523,Sheldon,16," Okay. Amy will be here shortly, expecting the perfect Valentine's gift, so, you're up kid. Dazzle me. Go.",6,Big Bang Theory,106,18
29525,Sheldon,16," Now, see, I never would have thought to do that. Clearly, I made a good choice farming this out to you. But I am telling you, Amy hit the boyfriend jackpot. Anyway, my socks are on. Let's knock them off.",6,Big Bang Theory,204,40
29527,Sheldon,16," Now, Amy already has a real harp. And it can play any song. What are you trying to pull here?",6,Big Bang Theory,94,20
29529,Sheldon,16, Next.,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
29531,Sheldon,16, Mmm.,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
29533,Sheldon,16, But she's got Google Maps on her phone.,6,Big Bang Theory,40,8
29535,Sheldon,16," Well, I hope it's with a third good option, because these first two, buh.",6,Big Bang Theory,74,14
29537,Sheldon,16," Wow. Oh, this is truly remarkable.",6,Big Bang Theory,35,6
29539,Sheldon,16, I think I'll keep it for myself.,6,Big Bang Theory,33,7
29541,Sheldon,16, It's too late. I call dibs.,6,Big Bang Theory,28,6
29543,Penny,16, This place is really beautiful.,6,Big Bang Theory,32,5
29544,Leonard,16," Waugh, romance ninja.",6,Big Bang Theory,22,3
29545,Penny,16, Hey.,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
29546,Howard,16, Sorry we're late.,6,Big Bang Theory,18,3
29547,Penny,16, No problem. We just sat down.,6,Big Bang Theory,30,6
29548,Leonard,16," Mmm, would you like some wine?",6,Big Bang Theory,31,6
29550,Penny,16, Is everything okay?,6,Big Bang Theory,20,3
29551,Howard,16, Terrific. Couldn't be better.,6,Big Bang Theory,30,4
29553,Howard,16," Look, we can still have a nice night. Just tell me where it is.",6,Big Bang Theory,64,14
29555,Leonard,16," Uh, where what is?",6,Big Bang Theory,19,4
29556,Howard,16," She hid my Xbox like I'm a child. Yeah, and my mom got me that for my birthday, so if you don't give it back, I'm telling.",6,Big Bang Theory,123,27
29558,Howard,16, I said I'm sorry.,6,Big Bang Theory,18,4
29560,Howard,16," I told you, turn them inside out.",6,Big Bang Theory,34,7
29562,Leonard,16," Trying to have a magical night here, guys.",6,Big Bang Theory,43,8
29563,Penny,16," Oh, son of a bitch.",6,Big Bang Theory,20,5
29564,Leonard,16, What?,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
29565,Penny,16, Nothing. Nothing.,6,Big Bang Theory,18,2
29566,Leonard,16," No, tell me.",6,Big Bang Theory,13,3
29567,Penny,16, It's just this guy I used to date.,6,Big Bang Theory,35,8
29568,Leonard,16, Oh.,6,Big Bang Theory,4,1
29569,Penny,16," Until he cheated on me with my friend Gretchen, who's here with him now.",6,Big Bang Theory,73,14
29570,Leonard,16, You're kidding.,6,Big Bang Theory,16,2
29571,Penny,16," And it looks like she lost a lot of weight, damn it.",6,Big Bang Theory,53,12
29572,Leonard,16," I know it's not ideal, but don't let them ruin our night.",6,Big Bang Theory,58,12
29573,Penny,16," No, you're totally right. She could be skinny 'cause she's dying.",6,Big Bang Theory,66,11
29574,Leonard,16, That's the spirit.,6,Big Bang Theory,19,3
29575,Penny,16," You know what, screw them. Our night is going to be way more special than theirs.",6,Big Bang Theory,82,16
29576,Leonard,16, Yeah.,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
29578,Penny,16," What?  Oh, you got to be kidding me.",6,Big Bang Theory,37,8
29580,Leonard,16, Two can play this game. Penny,6,Big Bang Theory,30,6
29581,Penny,16, Get up.,6,Big Bang Theory,8,2
29582,Leonard,16, All right.,6,Big Bang Theory,11,2
29584,Raj,16, It's nice that all the people who are lonely on Valentine's Day can come here tonight and be together.,6,Big Bang Theory,103,19
29586,Raj,16, Except on a date with anybody.,6,Big Bang Theory,31,6
29588,Raj,16," You know, you and I have so much fun hanging out. If you were a girl, all our problems would be solved.",6,Big Bang Theory,104,22
29590,Raj,16," Oh, yeah, think about it. We'd hang out, we'd read comic books, we'd see movies. It'd be like the best relationship ever.",6,Big Bang Theory,122,22
29592,Raj,16," Then I'd take you home, slip off your little black dress and just pile-drive you into oblivion.",6,Big Bang Theory,96,17
29595,Penny,16," Oh, I can't believe he's going to marry the girl he cheated on me with.",6,Big Bang Theory,72,15
29596,Leonard,16," Isn't it kind of nice? I mean, he was with the wrong person, and now he found the right person.",6,Big Bang Theory,96,20
29597,Penny,16," What, so I'm the wrong person? Maybe you want to be with Gretchen, too.",6,Big Bang Theory,72,14
29599,Howard,16," Yeah, maybe tonight. But a year from now, he'll be crawling under the sink looking for his Xbox. Well, he will.",6,Big Bang Theory,112,21
29600,Leonard,16, You know what? Why don't we just forget about them and enjoy our Valentine's Day?,6,Big Bang Theory,82,15
29601,Penny,16," Yes, absolutely. Now they're doing that phony link-arm-drink thingy. I totally taught him that.",6,Big Bang Theory,96,14
29602,Leonard,16, I thought we were letting it go.,6,Big Bang Theory,33,7
29603,Penny,16," We were; it's just, it's not fair, okay? They're bad people. It's not supposed to end happy for them, it's supposed to end happy for me.",6,Big Bang Theory,137,26
29604,Leonard,16," Um, it did end happy for you. You're here with me.",6,Big Bang Theory,51,11
29605,Penny,16," Yeah, yeah, I know.",6,Big Bang Theory,20,4
29606,Leonard,16," Okay, this is getting a little hard to not take personally.",6,Big Bang Theory,60,11
29607,Penny,16," Oh, come on, don't make this about you.",6,Big Bang Theory,40,8
29608,Leonard,16," Oh, I'm not. It's about you.",6,Big Bang Theory,29,6
29609,Penny,16," Yeah, well, whatever, okay? I told you, Valentine's Day sucks.",6,Big Bang Theory,63,10
29610,Leonard,16," This one does, and you're the reason why.",6,Big Bang Theory,42,8
29611,Penny,16, What?,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
29613,Howard,16," Me, too. How about we blow off dessert, go home early, I'll do that laundry.",6,Big Bang Theory,77,15
29615,Howard,16, I love you.,6,Big Bang Theory,12,3
29617,Howard,16, So where'd you hide it?,6,Big Bang Theory,24,5
29619,Howard,16," Damn it, it's in the washing machine.",6,Big Bang Theory,38,7
29621,Amy,16, Hello.,6,Big Bang Theory,7,1
29622,Sheldon,16, Hello.,6,Big Bang Theory,7,1
29623,Amy,16, Happy Valentine's Day.,6,Big Bang Theory,23,3
29624,Sheldon,16, Okay. Shall we go to dinner?,6,Big Bang Theory,29,6
29625,Amy,16," Hang on. As you know, I had planned a traditional evening of romance and gifts.",6,Big Bang Theory,80,15
29626,Sheldon,16," Yes, and as you know, I planned to pretend to enjoy it. I've been working on this facial expression all day.",6,Big Bang Theory,109,21
29627,Amy,16," And I appreciate your effort, but upon contemplation, I decided I was being selfish. So, I cancelled our dinner reservations and came up with an even better way to celebrate Valentine's Day.",6,Big Bang Theory,191,32
29628,Sheldon,16, What is that?,6,Big Bang Theory,14,3
29629,Amy,16," By doing none of it. No dinner, no romance, no gifts. We stay here, order a pizza and watch one of your beloved Star War Trek things.",6,Big Bang Theory,134,27
29630,Sheldon,16, Really?,6,Big Bang Theory,8,1
29631,Amy,16," Well, that's what you'd love, isn't it?",6,Big Bang Theory,40,7
29632,Sheldon,16, More than anything.,6,Big Bang Theory,20,3
29633,Amy,16," Well, then, that's what we're going to do.",6,Big Bang Theory,43,8
29634,Sheldon,16," Well, I don't know what to say. This is the most thoughtful gift that anyone's ever given me. And that's including an amazing gift that I gave myself earlier today.",6,Big Bang Theory,165,30
29635,Amy,16," I'm your girlfriend. That's my job. And I know gift-giving puts a lot of pressure on you, so whatever you got me, you can return.",6,Big Bang Theory,130,25
29636,Sheldon,16," No. No, after everything you didn't do for me tonight, I want you to have it.",6,Big Bang Theory,78,16
29637,Amy,16, What's this?,6,Big Bang Theory,13,2
29638,Sheldon,16, Read it.,6,Big Bang Theory,9,2
29639,Amy,16," Sheldon Cooper, Caltech University employee information?",6,Big Bang Theory,57,6
29640,Sheldon,16, At the bottom.,6,Big Bang Theory,15,3
29641,Amy,16," In case of emergency, please contact Amy Farrah Fowler. And there's my phone number. This is the most beautiful gift you could've ever given me.",6,Big Bang Theory,145,25
29642,Sheldon,16," Well, I thought, if I have a stroke or a kidney stone, who would I want to share that with?",6,Big Bang Theory,92,20
29643,Amy,16, And you picked me.,6,Big Bang Theory,19,4
29644,Sheldon,16," It's like you said, you're my girlfriend.",6,Big Bang Theory,42,7
29645,Amy,16," Oh, Sheldon.",6,Big Bang Theory,13,2
29646,Sheldon,16, Yeah. Okay. Stop ruining Valentine's Day and order my pizza.,6,Big Bang Theory,61,10
29648,Penny,16, Night.,6,Big Bang Theory,7,1
29649,Leonard,16," Yep. You know what? That was pretty crappy of you. I mean, all I wanted to do was give you a great night, and it's like you-you went out of your way to destroy it.",6,Big Bang Theory,164,35
29650,Penny,16," Yeah, I know. I'm a total bitch.",6,Big Bang Theory,33,7
29651,Leonard,16, I'm not saying that.,6,Big Bang Theory,21,4
29652,Penny,16," Well, I am.",6,Big Bang Theory,12,3
29653,Leonard,16," Fine, you win. You're a bitch. Why couldn't we just have a nice time?",6,Big Bang Theory,70,14
29654,Penny,16, I don't know. Maybe 'cause things are going so well between us lately and I've been really happy.,6,Big Bang Theory,98,18
29655,Leonard,16," Okay, you're gonna have to make a lot more sense than that.",6,Big Bang Theory,60,12
29656,Penny,16," Obviously, I have some commitment issues.",6,Big Bang Theory,42,6
29657,Leonard,16, Glaringly obvious. Go on.,6,Big Bang Theory,26,4
29658,Penny,16," As long as things keep going great between us, you'll keep asking me to marry you, and eventually I'm gonna end up saying yes, and then we're gonna be married forever, and the whole thing just freaks me out.",6,Big Bang Theory,208,39
29659,Leonard,16, Okay. I know I propose a lot. So how about this? I promise I will never ask you to marry me again.,6,Big Bang Theory,99,22
29660,Penny,16," What, what do you mean? Are you breaking up with me?",6,Big Bang Theory,53,11
29661,Leonard,16," No. No, no, no, no. But if someday you decide you want to get married, you have to propose to me.",6,Big Bang Theory,98,21
29662,Penny,16, Really?,6,Big Bang Theory,8,1
29663,Leonard,16," Yes. It's all on you. But I got to tell you, when the time comes, I want the whole nine yards. I want you down on one knee, flowers, I want to be swept off my feet.",6,Big Bang Theory,165,37
29664,Penny,16," Yeah, you got it.",6,Big Bang Theory,18,4
29665,Leonard,16, And I'm cool with surprises. But nothing on a Jumbotron. I don't want to cry on a big screen like that.,6,Big Bang Theory,104,21
29666,Penny,16," Okay. You know what? This might be the wine talking, but I have a very important question to ask you.",6,Big Bang Theory,102,20
29667,Leonard,16, You do?,6,Big Bang Theory,8,2
29668,Penny,16, Leonard Hofstadter?,6,Big Bang Theory,20,2
29669,Leonard,16, Yes?,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
29670,Penny,16, Will you be my valentine?,6,Big Bang Theory,26,5
29671,Leonard,16, Sorry. Maybe next year. I'm just kidding. Romance ninja. Let's have sex. Waugh!,6,Big Bang Theory,80,13
29674,Raj,16, We're glad you could make it.,6,Big Bang Theory,30,6
29676,Raj,16, What is it about this holiday that makes people so unhappy?,6,Big Bang Theory,60,11
29680,Raj,16," I got to tell you, we've got to stop beating ourselves up like this. Excuse me, everybody. Can I have your attention, please? We're all here tonight because we have no one to be with. But that doesn't make us mutants. The only mutants here are in these comic books. We've got to stop defining our self-worth by whether or not we're in a relationship. You know what I see when I look around? I see a room full of great people. So let's give ourselves a break. We are a community, and as long as we have each other, we're never truly alone.",6,Big Bang Theory,539,104
29682,Raj,16, You really think so?,6,Big Bang Theory,21,4
29684,Raj,16," Thank you. Uh, would you like to, uh, get a cup, a cup of coffee or?",6,Big Bang Theory,69,16
29686,Raj,16," Later, losers!",6,Big Bang Theory,15,2
29688,Amy,16," Hello? Another medical emergency? What's wrong with him now? I seriously doubt he was bitten by a Chinese bird spider. How exactly does a bump feel Asian? Just put him on the phone. Sheldon, I am not driving over there again. Because I drove over there yesterday for a brain tumour that turned out to be an ice cream headache. Yes, I still want to be your emergency contact. Yes, you can eat your ice cream too fast and also have a brain tumour. I'm on my way. Brain tumour would explain a lot.",6,Big Bang Theory,495,94
29690,Raj,17," So then I went to Cambridge, which was wonderful not only because it's a good school but because it totally looks like Hogwarts. That's where I fell in love with astronomy, and now I'm an astrophysicist at Caltech, so I guess you could say, uh, Raj is my name and stars are my game. And rhyming is also my game. So, uh, two games. Uh, anyway, that, that's enough about me. I want to hear everything about you.",6,Big Bang Theory,410,78
29692,Raj,17," I go to the bathroom, too. Sometimes more frequently than I care to admit. Oh, I've had it checked out, it's nothing. Hmm. This is going great. Mmm, can I have a refill on my chai tea? Yes, I have a good feeling about this.  I should have bought condoms.",6,Big Bang Theory,255,50
29694,Sheldon,17," Hello, I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. My apologies that this episode is coming late. I did shoot one last week, in honour of Black History Month, but I was informed by my roommate that my spot-on portrayal of George Washington Carver could be considered wildly racist. My heart goes out to the members of the African-American community, who, like me, have been kept down by The Man. Now, Fun with Flags is not just for the flag aficionado, it's also for the flag novice, so, to help me with that, please welcome my friend, neighbour, and flag virgin, yeah, not a real virgin. She's had coitus many times. Sometimes within earshot of this flag enthusiast. Once while he was trying to watch The Incredibles. Penny.",6,Big Bang Theory,757,132
29695,Penny,17, Hello.,6,Big Bang Theory,7,1
29696,Sheldon,17," So, Penny, I understand you would like to learn more about flags.",6,Big Bang Theory,66,12
29697,Penny,17," Yeah, I can't tell you how many times I've been at a party where everyone's talking about flags and I just couldn't join in.",6,Big Bang Theory,125,24
29698,Sheldon,17," Yeah. Well, you came to the right place.",6,Big Bang Theory,41,8
29699,Penny,17," Uh, I'm sorry, can we just pause for a minute?",6,Big Bang Theory,47,10
29700,Sheldon,17, What's wrong?,6,Big Bang Theory,14,2
29701,Penny,17," I just think it might look more natural if you talked to me instead of the camera, you know, like, like a real conversation. It's something we work on in my acting class.",6,Big Bang Theory,171,33
29702,Sheldon,17, Interesting. A few people in the comments section have said that my delivery is robotic. Perhaps that isn't the compliment it sounds like.,6,Big Bang Theory,139,23
29703,Penny,17," Yeah, let's try it again, and maybe, this time, you could work on your body language a bit. You know, when you're all hunched like that, you're shutting the audience out, but when you're relaxed and open, you're inviting them in.",6,Big Bang Theory,230,41
29704,Sheldon,17, Right. And which one do I want?,6,Big Bang Theory,32,7
29705,Penny,17, Let's try open.,6,Big Bang Theory,16,3
29706,Sheldon,17," If our friend, the flag, has taught me anything, it's to go where the wind takes you. As long as you remain firmly attached to a rigid pole. And, action. So, Penny, what sort of flag questions keep you awake at night?",6,Big Bang Theory,218,42
29707,Penny,17," Um, well, I'm from Nebraska. So what can you tell me about the state flag?",6,Big Bang Theory,75,15
29708,Sheldon,17," Gosh, Penny, what'd you have for breakfast? A big glass of good question juice? The Nebraska state flag is simply the state seal on a field of blue. Spread your legs, invite them in.",6,Big Bang Theory,183,34
29710,Howard,17," I'm telling you, something's wrong. I can always feel it when Raj is in trouble.",6,Big Bang Theory,81,15
29712,Leonard,17," Don't look under that rock.  Raj, you okay?",6,Big Bang Theory,44,8
29713,Howard,17, You in there?,6,Big Bang Theory,14,3
29714,Raj,17, Go away!,6,Big Bang Theory,9,2
29715,Leonard,17," Come on, buddy, open up.",6,Big Bang Theory,25,5
29716,Howard,17, We're worried about you.,6,Big Bang Theory,25,4
29717,Raj,17," Oh, just because I've stopped going to work and answering my phone you think something bad happened? Maybe something good happened.",6,Big Bang Theory,132,21
29719,Raj,17, Of course not. Nothing good ever happens. ,6,Big Bang Theory,43,7
29720,Leonard,17, Whoa.,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
29721,Raj,17, What?,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
29722,Leonard,17," Nope, just, just, whoa.",6,Big Bang Theory,24,4
29724,Leonard,17," Raj, what's going on?",6,Big Bang Theory,22,4
29725,Raj,17, I was humiliated by yet another woman.,6,Big Bang Theory,39,7
29726,Howard,17," You didn't kill her and chop her up, that's not what we're smelling, right?",6,Big Bang Theory,76,14
29727,Raj,17," No. I took her for coffee, and she snuck out the bathroom window to get away from me.",6,Big Bang Theory,86,18
29729,Raj,17, I went and looked. It was a high and tiny window. She must have been very motivated.,6,Big Bang Theory,85,17
29730,Howard,17," I'm sorry. That's awful, but come on, you got to shake it off.",6,Big Bang Theory,63,13
29731,Leonard,17," Yeah, you can't stay in your apartment for the rest of your life.",6,Big Bang Theory,66,13
29732,Raj,17," Why not? With online shopping and overnight delivery, I can get anything I want. Look, I just ordered a case of Dinty Moore beef stew and two live lobsters on Amazon.",6,Big Bang Theory,167,31
29733,Leonard,17, Lobsters overnight?,6,Big Bang Theory,20,2
29734,Howard,17," Oh, you're kidding. Let me see. Well, I'll be. Look, you can throw in a couple steaks and have a surf and turf.",6,Big Bang Theory,112,23
29735,Leonard,17, The surf and turf sounds good. See if they have corn on the cob.,6,Big Bang Theory,65,14
29737,Raj,17," You're wasting your time. Just please, leave me alone.",6,Big Bang Theory,55,9
29738,Howard,17, Now what?,6,Big Bang Theory,10,2
29739,Leonard,17, I don't know.,6,Big Bang Theory,14,3
29742,Amy,17," Hello, Sheldon.",6,Big Bang Theory,16,2
29743,Sheldon,17, Hello. How's the final stage of your nicotine addiction study going?,6,Big Bang Theory,69,11
29744,Amy,17," Fine. Just hold on. Mommy's on the phone! Sorry. We've cut the monkeys down to one cigarette a day, so things are a little intense. Makes me miss my marijuana-abusing flatworms. Those guys were mellow.",6,Big Bang Theory,202,35
29745,Sheldon,17," Good news. Uh, the latest episode of Fun with Flags is online.",6,Big Bang Theory,63,12
29746,Amy,17," Oh, that's right. How'd it go with Penny?",6,Big Bang Theory,42,8
29747,Sheldon,17, Much better than I expected. She even gave me some helpful tips about acting and body language. Watch. Welcome to my world. Not welcome to my world. Welcome. Not welcome.,6,Big Bang Theory,171,30
29748,Amy,17," Subtle, but powerful.",6,Big Bang Theory,22,3
29749,Sheldon,17, I know. I'm still learning to control it.,6,Big Bang Theory,42,8
29750,Amy,17, Did you tell Penny how helpful she was?,6,Big Bang Theory,40,8
29751,Sheldon,17, Why would I do that?,6,Big Bang Theory,21,5
29752,Amy,17," Because she's your friend, and she did a nice job. I'm sure she'd like to hear it.",6,Big Bang Theory,83,17
29753,Sheldon,17, All right.,6,Big Bang Theory,11,2
29754,Amy,17," I didn't mean now. Hello? Yeah, yeah, you want a cigarette. Well, I'd like a normal boyfriend. Deal with it.",6,Big Bang Theory,109,20
29756,Penny,17," Oh, hi. What's up?",6,Big Bang Theory,19,4
29757,Sheldon,17, Um,6,Big Bang Theory,3,1
29758,Penny,17, You need me to shut the door so you can do your knocking thing?,6,Big Bang Theory,64,14
29759,Sheldon,17," No. I didn't start yet, it's fine.",6,Big Bang Theory,35,7
29760,Penny,17," Okay. So, what do you need?",6,Big Bang Theory,28,6
29761,Sheldon,17," Well, I was thinking about you helping me out last night  Penny. And I just wanted to tell you  Penny, that the answer to the question, who did a great job? is you,  Penny.",6,Big Bang Theory,173,34
29762,Penny,17, Really?,6,Big Bang Theory,8,1
29763,Sheldon,17," Yes, you were very natural in front of the camera, and I found your suggestions extremely helpful.",6,Big Bang Theory,99,17
29764,Penny,17," Aw, sweetie, you just made my day.",6,Big Bang Theory,35,7
29765,Sheldon,17, Okay.,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
29766,Penny,17," Hey, my acting class is putting on a play Friday night. I could put you and Amy on the guest list.",6,Big Bang Theory,99,21
29767,Sheldon,17," Oh, that sounds terrible. Why would I want to do that?",6,Big Bang Theory,55,11
29769,Amy,17, That's right. They're no good without the lighter.,6,Big Bang Theory,51,8
29770,Sheldon,17," Well, so much for your advice on complimenting Penny.",6,Big Bang Theory,54,9
29771,Amy,17, Why? What happened?,6,Big Bang Theory,20,3
29772,Sheldon,17," She tried to rope us into going to her acting class to see a play. Don't worry. Luckily, I had the good sense to drown that kitten in the river.",6,Big Bang Theory,145,30
29773,Amy,17," Sheldon, that's very rude. She helped you with your show. The right thing to do is reciprocate by going to see her play.",6,Big Bang Theory,121,23
29774,Sheldon,17," Oh, so many crazy rules.",6,Big Bang Theory,25,5
29775,Amy,17, That better be Tootsie Rolls you're throwing at me!,6,Big Bang Theory,52,9
29777,Sheldon,17,"  Penny.  Penny.  Penny. Oh yeah, much better.",6,Big Bang Theory,46,7
29778,Penny,17, What?,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
29779,Sheldon,17," Amy pointed out to me that since you did something nice for me, I'm obligated to do something nice for you. So, yes, I'll go to your dopey play.",6,Big Bang Theory,145,29
29780,Penny,17," Hey, I don't want you to go any more.",6,Big Bang Theory,38,9
29781,Sheldon,17, Why not?,6,Big Bang Theory,9,2
29782,Penny,17," You should go 'cause you want to go, not because you have to.",6,Big Bang Theory,62,13
29783,Sheldon,17," Oh, Dear Lord, more rules? Where does it stop? Can I want to go because I have to want to go?",6,Big Bang Theory,94,21
29784,Penny,17, Okay. Do whatever you want.,6,Big Bang Theory,28,5
29785,Sheldon,17," Yeah, but now, wait. Do whatever I want? Or whatever I have to want?",6,Big Bang Theory,69,14
29786,Penny,17," Oh, for God's sake, just come to the play.",6,Big Bang Theory,43,9
29787,Sheldon,17," All right. I don't want to, but at least that makes sense.",6,Big Bang Theory,59,12
29789,Sheldon,17," You know, I haven't seen Raj in several days. Is he no longer a part of our social group? And if so, should we be interviewing for a replacement? Perhaps, this time, we go Latin.",6,Big Bang Theory,179,35
29790,Howard,17, He's just decided he's never leaving his apartment again.,6,Big Bang Theory,58,9
29791,Sheldon,17," Oh, brilliant. I've been itching to pull that trigger.",6,Big Bang Theory,55,9
29792,Howard,17, He's upset because he can't get anywhere with women.,6,Big Bang Theory,53,9
29793,Sheldon,17, Would it help if I gave him some pointers? I'm just funnin' ya.,6,Big Bang Theory,64,13
29797,Howard,17," You're the one? Okay, let me tell you something. That guy you blew off happens to be my best friend. Okay? He was devastated.",6,Big Bang Theory,126,24
29799,Howard,17," Okay. But I gotta warn you, Raj is a proud, passionate man. If you go running out on him again, you're only gonna get, like, three or four more chances before you are history.",6,Big Bang Theory,176,34
29801,Howard,17," Come on, she came back. This is good news. You should celebrate.",6,Big Bang Theory,65,12
29802,Raj,17, I don't want to celebrate.,6,Big Bang Theory,27,5
29803,Howard,17," Not even a little? I mean, we could have a pants party. Go put some on.",6,Big Bang Theory,72,16
29804,Raj,17, Why would I want her number? I don't want anything to do with this woman.,6,Big Bang Theory,74,15
29805,Howard,17," Oh, come on, Raj.",6,Big Bang Theory,18,4
29806,Raj,17," No, you don't get it. I want nothing to do with any woman. My heart is stone. From now on, I'm a monk. I renounce all worldly pleasures. Except for lobster. And garlic butter.",6,Big Bang Theory,176,34
29807,Howard,17," Boy, I want to tell you it's her loss, but you are not making it easy.",6,Big Bang Theory,71,16
29808,Raj,17," You're, you're a good friend for trying to help, but, I've made my choice.",6,Big Bang Theory,75,14
29809,Howard,17," All right. Well, I'll see you around.",6,Big Bang Theory,38,7
29810,Raj,17," See you. No, wait, take her number. I don't want the temptation.",6,Big Bang Theory,65,12
29811,Howard,17, Okay.,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
29812,Raj,17," I must be strong so I don't stray from my true purpose, the study of the universe.",6,Big Bang Theory,83,17
29813,Howard,17, All right. Thanks for ruining lobster for me.,6,Big Bang Theory,46,8
29815,Raj,17, Wait! Give me the number! Give me the number! Give me the number!,6,Big Bang Theory,66,13
29817,Leonard,17," So, Amy, what's going on with your addiction study?",6,Big Bang Theory,52,9
29818,Amy,17," Sadly, I'm no longer associated with that project.",6,Big Bang Theory,51,8
29819,Leonard,17, Why? What happened?,6,Big Bang Theory,20,3
29820,Amy,17," Typical bureaucratic nonsense. You can get animals addicted to a harmful substance, you can dissect their brains, but you throw their own faeces back at them and suddenly you're unprofessional.",6,Big Bang Theory,194,30
29821,Leonard,17, I'm sorry. That I asked.,6,Big Bang Theory,25,5
29822,Sheldon,17," All right, let's get this stupid play over with.",6,Big Bang Theory,49,9
29823,Leonard,17," Uh, hang on. Empty your pockets.",6,Big Bang Theory,33,6
29824,Sheldon,17, Why?,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
29825,Leonard,17, You know why. The Nintendo DS. And the PSP. Now the Gameboy.,6,Big Bang Theory,61,12
29826,Sheldon,17," Aw, for Pete's sake. Can we go now?",6,Big Bang Theory,36,8
29827,Leonard,17," Well, is that all of it?  Just set it down.",6,Big Bang Theory,44,10
29828,Amy,17," Just so you know, this is not a stupid play. A Streetcar Named Desire is an American classic.",6,Big Bang Theory,94,18
29829,Sheldon,17," It's about streetcars? Oh, great. I won't need this. ",6,Big Bang Theory,54,9
29831,Raj,17," Just a sec. Oh, who says just a sec? I hate myself. Hello.",6,Big Bang Theory,59,13
29833,Raj,17," Uh, would you like to come in?",6,Big Bang Theory,31,7
29835,Raj,17, Oh.,6,Big Bang Theory,4,1
29837,Raj,17," Wait. Can you at least tell me what went wrong? It's okay. I can take anything. Unless it's something I did, or said, or am. â€˜Cause those are, like, my buttons.",6,Big Bang Theory,163,31
29839,Raj,17, Really? Then what were you doing at the comic book store that night?,6,Big Bang Theory,69,13
29841,Raj,17," Yeah, me neither.",6,Big Bang Theory,18,3
29843,Raj,17, I lied. I love them. I only said that so you'd go out with me.,6,Big Bang Theory,63,15
29845,Raj,17," That's great. I'm broken, too.",6,Big Bang Theory,31,5
29847,Raj,17," Oh, I totally am. If it wasn't for this beer, I couldn't even talk to you right now. I'm a wreck. There are many things seriously wrong with me. And not quirks, either. Like, diagnosable psychological problems. Maybe brain damage.",6,Big Bang Theory,231,40
29849,Raj,17," Go out with me on one date, and I promise you, you'll see.",6,Big Bang Theory,59,13
29851,Raj,17," You won't regret it. I'm the most pathetic guy you've ever met. And that, boys and girls, is how it's done.",6,Big Bang Theory,108,21
29855,Penny,17," I think you have a great capacity for devotion. You'll be lonely when she passes on, won't you? I understand what that is.",6,Big Bang Theory,123,23
29857,Leonard,17," She's pretty good, huh?",6,Big Bang Theory,24,4
29858,Sheldon,17, She is. But when do they get to the part about streetcars?,6,Big Bang Theory,59,12
29859,Penny,17," when I was a very young girl. When I was 16 years old, I made the discovery, love. All at once, and much, much too completely. It was like you suddenly turned a blinding light on something that had always been half a shadow. That's how it struck the world for me. But I was unlucky. Deluded.",6,Big Bang Theory,292,57
29860,Sheldon,17, She's remarkable.,6,Big Bang Theory,18,2
29861,Leonard,17, She really is.,6,Big Bang Theory,15,3
29862,Amy,17, Our Penny's a star.,6,Big Bang Theory,20,4
29863,Sheldon,17," How can she remember all those lines, but as a waitress, she can't remember no tomato on my hamburger?",6,Big Bang Theory,103,19
29865,Leonard,18," Look, I know you guys don't want to do this, but we have no choice. So, you can either bitch and whine or we can just get it over with.",6,Big Bang Theory,136,30
29866,Howard,18, I got whine.,6,Big Bang Theory,13,3
29867,Sheldon,18, I got the B word.,6,Big Bang Theory,18,5
29868,Leonard,18," Yeah, well, it's in our contract to serve on a university committee. And frankly, this is one I believe in. Okay, here we go. Encouraging more women to pursue a career in the sciences.",6,Big Bang Theory,185,34
29869,Howard,18," Come on, if I was any good at convincing women to do stuff, I wouldn't have spent so much of my twenties in the shower.",6,Big Bang Theory,120,25
29870,Sheldon,18," If you ask me, this whole thing is a waste of our time.",6,Big Bang Theory,56,13
29871,Leonard,18, Helping women? Y,6,Big Bang Theory,17,3
29872,Sheldon,18, Helping anyone. People should take care of themselves.,6,Big Bang Theory,55,8
29873,Leonard,18," Oh, like yesterday, when you made me drive you to the dry cleaners, the pharmacy and the post office?",6,Big Bang Theory,102,19
29874,Sheldon,18, I'm not saying people can't use tools. Even an otter picks up a rock when he wants a clam.,6,Big Bang Theory,91,19
29875,Leonard,18, You don't think it's worthwhile to try to get more women working in science.,6,Big Bang Theory,77,14
29876,Sheldon,18," I think that's incredibly sexist of you. I believe in a gender-blind society like in Star Trek, where women and men of all races and creeds work side by side as equals.",6,Big Bang Theory,169,32
29877,Leonard,18," You mean where they were advanced enough to invent an interstellar warp drive, but a black lady still answered the space phone?",6,Big Bang Theory,128,22
29878,Howard,18," Oh, I did spend a lot of my shower time with Lieutenant Uhura.",6,Big Bang Theory,63,13
29879,Sheldon,18," Howard's disturbing recollections aside, I don't appreciate being forced to do banal committee work.",6,Big Bang Theory,101,14
29880,Leonard,18," Yes, I know, you're too smart for this.",6,Big Bang Theory,40,8
29881,Sheldon,18, Exactly. It's like asking the Human Torch to heat up your frozen burrito.,6,Big Bang Theory,74,13
29882,Leonard,18," Got it. All right, I'm thinking one way to counter bias in the peer-review process, is for papers to be submitted under gender-neutral names. Like S. Smith instead of Samantha Smith.",6,Big Bang Theory,183,31
29883,Sheldon,18," I suppose there is a history of professional women using their initials so as not to be pre-judged. Harry Potter's J.K. Rowling, uh, Star Trek's D.C. Fontana.",6,Big Bang Theory,159,27
29884,Howard,18," Van Nuys pole-dancer D.D. Melons. All right, I think we've really helped women today. Let's fire up the old Xbox.",6,Big Bang Theory,114,20
29885,Leonard,18," Guys, please don't make this a school project where I'm the smart kid doing all the work while the slackers sit back and watch.",6,Big Bang Theory,128,24
29886,Sheldon,18, We're not. This time you're the smart kid doing all the work while the even smarter kids sit back and watch.,6,Big Bang Theory,109,21
29887,Howard,18," So, you think I'm one of the smarter kids?",6,Big Bang Theory,43,9
29888,Sheldon,18," No, you're a tool I was using to make my point.",6,Big Bang Theory,48,11
29890,Leonard,18," Guys, our topic is encouraging women in science, can you at least play a less sexist game",6,Big Bang Theory,90,17
29891,Sheldon,18, How is it sexist? My character wields a battle axe as well as any man.,6,Big Bang Theory,71,15
29892,Howard,18, Not to mention she has mammary glands that could nurse a family of 30. And have enough milk left over to open a Baskin Robbins.,6,Big Bang Theory,128,25
29893,Sheldon,18," Mother, warrior-princess, franchise owner, I hear glass ceilings shattering all over town.",6,Big Bang Theory,91,12
29894,Leonard,18," Sheldon, you're always saying how much smarter you are than me. Spend five seconds and come up with one idea on how to get more women into science.",6,Big Bang Theory,148,28
29895,Sheldon,18, All your ideas address the issue at a university level. By then it's too late. You need to design an outreach program that targets girls at the middle school level and sets them on an academic track towards the hard sciences.,6,Big Bang Theory,226,41
29896,Leonard,18, That's actually good. Why didn't I think of that?,6,Big Bang Theory,50,9
29897,Sheldon,18," Some people are otters, some people are rocks.",6,Big Bang Theory,47,8
29898,Leonard,18, I wonder if there's a way we could give the idea a trial run.,6,Big Bang Theory,62,14
29899,Howard,18," Maybe I could call my old middle school, see if we can talk to some of the female students.",6,Big Bang Theory,92,19
29900,Leonard,18," That's great, try to set up something for the three of us to go over there.",6,Big Bang Theory,76,16
29901,Sheldon,18," Oh, hold on. While I'm comfortable speaking about science, I'm not sure I know how to spark the interest of schoolchildren. Better Google it.",6,Big Bang Theory,142,24
29902,Howard,18, What exactly are you looking up?,6,Big Bang Theory,33,6
29903,Sheldon,18, How do I get 12-year-old girls excited.,6,Big Bang Theory,40,7
29906,Raj,18, Thanks again for letting me crash girls' night.,6,Big Bang Theory,48,8
29907,Penny,18, Are you kidding? You brought fancy wine and made fondue. I've slept with guys for less. It's a joke. Based on real events.,6,Big Bang Theory,123,23
29908,Raj,18," Anyway, I was hoping I could, uh, pick your brains a little. I'm supposed to take Lucy out Friday and I need a killer first date.",6,Big Bang Theory,130,26
29909,Amy,18," Well, evolutionary biology says that women are attracted to a man who is steady n the face of danger, so I recommend an unsafe environment. Seedy bar on the wrong side of the tracks, picnic near a lunatic asylum, a wine tasting on Skid Row.",6,Big Bang Theory,241,45
29910,Raj,18," Uh, Lucy has some, uh, social anxiety issues. Maybe we could start with something simpler.",6,Big Bang Theory,91,15
29912,Penny,18," Yeah, but you just have to remember, that ride is shorter than you think and they take a picture of you at the end, so make sure you got your clothes back on. It's a joke. Based on real events.",6,Big Bang Theory,194,40
29913,Raj,18," Mm, Disneyland? I don't know. With all the crowds and the weird characters walking around, just reminds me too much of India.",6,Big Bang Theory,126,22
29914,Amy,18, I haven't been to Disneyland since I was a kid. We should definitely go one weekend.,6,Big Bang Theory,85,16
29916,Penny,18," So, blow off work, go on a weekday.",6,Big Bang Theory,36,8
29917,Amy,18, Hooky? I've never played hooky in my life. My mom said that's how girls end up addicted to reefer and jazz music.,6,Big Bang Theory,114,22
29918,Penny,18, It's more like how girls end up at a Best Western hotel with a 34-year-old guy named Luther.,6,Big Bang Theory,93,18
29920,Penny,18, I can laugh about it now.,6,Big Bang Theory,26,6
29922,Penny,18, I'm in.,6,Big Bang Theory,8,2
29923,Amy,18," Me, too.",6,Big Bang Theory,9,2
29924,Raj,18," Excuse me, I thought we were trying to solve my problem?",6,Big Bang Theory,57,11
29925,Penny,18," Oh, yeah, right. Wait, what was your problem again?",6,Big Bang Theory,52,9
29926,Raj,18," I am a man who can't talk to women, trying to figure out how to go on a romantic date with a girl who suffers from such crippling social anxiety she can't be around other people.",6,Big Bang Theory,179,36
29927,Penny,18," Yeah, that's a toughie.",6,Big Bang Theory,24,4
29929,Amy,18," Hmm. We doing just Disney or California Adventure, too?",6,Big Bang Theory,56,9
29931,Leonard,18, It's nice of your old school to let us try out our science talk on some female students.,6,Big Bang Theory,89,18
29932,Howard,18," Well, they're actually pretty excited. I'm their most famous alum. If you don't count the serial killer who ate all those prostitutes.",6,Big Bang Theory,135,22
29933,Sheldon,18," This must feel pretty good for you, coming back to your alma mater as an astronaut.",6,Big Bang Theory,84,16
29934,Howard,18," Yeah, last time I was here, I was just a scrawny little nerd.",6,Big Bang Theory,62,13
29935,Leonard,18, And now you're also an astronaut.,6,Big Bang Theory,34,6
29936,Howard,18," So many memories. I mean, how many times in these hallways was I tripped, punched and spit on? Oh, look, here's my old locker. I have a masters in engineering and I still can't figure out how Scott Kapinski got me and my briefcase to fit in there.  Hey.",6,Big Bang Theory,254,49
29938,Howard,18, Nothing.,6,Big Bang Theory,9,1
29939,Sheldon,18, Smart. We don't want any problems.,6,Big Bang Theory,35,6
29941,Amy,18, I can't believe I ditched work for Disneyland.,6,Big Bang Theory,47,8
29943,Amy,18," Oh, I was very clever, I did it in stages. At seven o'clock last night, I called about a problem at the lab and casually mentioned I was going out for seafood. At nine thirty, I called and told him that one of my scallops tasted weird. At eleven thirty, I called and said I was throwing up like a fire hose. At twelve forty-five, I called and made nothing but dry heaving sounds, and now I'm going to Disneyland.",6,Big Bang Theory,413,80
29945,Penny,18," I work at the Cheesecake Factory, I said bye.",6,Big Bang Theory,46,9
29946,Amy,18," So, what are we gonna do first?",6,Big Bang Theory,32,7
29948,Amy,18," Ooh, that sounds like fun.",6,Big Bang Theory,27,5
29949,Penny,18," You're kidding, right? We're not just gonna get drunk and go on rides?",6,Big Bang Theory,71,13
29950,Amy,18," Come on, do it with us.",6,Big Bang Theory,24,6
29951,Penny,18," All right, whatever. How does it work?",6,Big Bang Theory,39,7
29953,Penny,18, Guess it would be fun to be Cinderella.,6,Big Bang Theory,40,8
29954,Amy,18," Oh, I want to be Cinderella, too.",6,Big Bang Theory,34,7
29955,Penny,18, Yeah.,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
29957,Amy,18, Then how do we decide?,6,Big Bang Theory,23,5
29960,Raj,18," Excuse me, I'm meeting a girl here. It's kind of our first date.",6,Big Bang Theory,65,13
29962,Raj,18," She and I are both a little awkward in social situations, so this seemed like a good idea.",6,Big Bang Theory,91,18
29964,Raj,18," No, you can't join us. Just go, go climb back up whatever beanstalk you came down from.",6,Big Bang Theory,88,17
29967,Raj,18," As you're reading, it will help to remember I have an adorable accent.",6,Big Bang Theory,71,13
29969,Leonard,18," Okay, who's ready for some science? Me, too. Okay, I am Dr. Leonard Hofstadter. I am here with my friends Dr. Cooper and real-life astronaut Howard Wolowitz, and we are going to show you girls how cool a job in science can be. How cool, you ask? Well, how about negative 273 degrees, 'cause that's the temperature at which entropy reaches its minimum value. Did I just learn something new and have fun doing it? What? All right. So now let's bring out theoretical physicist Dr. Sheldon Cooper.",6,Big Bang Theory,494,88
29970,Sheldon,18," Hello, female children. Allow me to inspire you with a story about a great female scientist. Polish-born, French-educated Madame Curie. Co-discoverer of radioactivity, she was a hero of science, until her hair fell out, her vomit and stool became filled with blood, and she was poisoned to death by her own discovery. With a little hard work, I see no reason why that can't happen to any of you. Are we done? Can we go?",6,Big Bang Theory,420,75
29971,Howard,18," The thing to remember is you can go to outer space, too. I mean, look at me. I went to this very school. Those desks you're sitting in, I was once superglued to one of them.",6,Big Bang Theory,174,36
29973,Howard,18," No, but I did go to the International Space Station.",6,Big Bang Theory,53,10
29975,Howard,18," No, but I was in the rocket. I didn't actually",6,Big Bang Theory,47,10
29977,Howard,18," No, I'm an American hero. Your uncle brings people nuts, okay?",6,Big Bang Theory,63,11
29978,Leonard,18," Alright, alright. Boy, we are learning a lot here, huh? Thank you, astronaut Howard. Um, I am what's called an experimental physicist, which is super-fun, because I get to test theories and work with lasers. Yes?",6,Big Bang Theory,213,36
29980,Leonard,18," Uh, excellent question. Um, I suppose I've always been into science, you know. My mother and father are scientists, so I was kind of led in that direction. Uh, pushed might be a better way to describe it. To be honest with you guys, when I was your age, I wanted to be a rap star. Like Snoop Dogg, but with a healthy respect for the police. Yeah, no, sure, you laugh. Just like my mother did. After I confided, I was derided and chided, my moms and I collided. She said my dreams were misguided. That's just a little freestyle.",6,Big Bang Theory,528,101
29982,Raj,18," My dad's a gynaecologist in India, so if you're over there and need a check up, as he likes to say, he's at your cervix.",6,Big Bang Theory,121,25
29984,Raj,18, That's a fitting pun-ishment. I still don't know what you do for a living.,6,Big Bang Theory,75,14
29986,Raj,18, Anything I might have seen?,6,Big Bang Theory,28,5
29988,Raj,18," No, never. What is porn?",6,Big Bang Theory,25,5
29990,Raj,18," Ooh, fun. I love prom. The romance, the gowns, it's like a fairy tale come to life. Sorry. Autocorrect. That was supposed to say, I like sports.",6,Big Bang Theory,145,27
29992,Leonard,18," I never wanted to play the cello. How do you meet girls playing the cello? Hey, you want to come over to my house and listen to me play an instrument that sounds like a suicidal bumblebee?",6,Big Bang Theory,189,37
29993,Howard,18," Quick, pull the fire alarm. Let's get out of here.",6,Big Bang Theory,51,10
29994,Sheldon,18," Uh, hello again. Um, yeah, I don't know if women in general have been actively discouraged from pursuing the sciences, but it's clear you young women here, today, have been. While I was listening to my colleagues waste your time, it occurred to me that it might be much more meaningful to hear about women in science from actual women in science, and, uh, I happen to know two brilliant examples who have agreed to speak to you on the phone right now. Uh, Dr. Rostenkowski, Dr. Fowler, are you there?",6,Big Bang Theory,501,91
29995,Amy,18, We're here.,6,Big Bang Theory,12,2
29996,Sheldon,18, Thank you for taking time out of your very busy schedule to enlighten these young women.,6,Big Bang Theory,89,16
29997,Amy,18," It's our pleasure. I'm Dr. Fowler, and I'm a neuroscientist.",6,Big Bang Theory,61,10
29999,Amy,18," The world of science needs more women, but from a young age, we girls are encouraged to care more about the way we look than about the power of our minds.",6,Big Bang Theory,155,31
30001,Penny,18, Unless you want to be Cinderella.,6,Big Bang Theory,34,6
30004,Raj,18, This was really fun.,6,Big Bang Theory,21,4
30006,Raj,18, I'm counting that as foreplay.,6,Big Bang Theory,31,5
30008,Howard,18," Bernie, I'm home. You have fun today?",6,Big Bang Theory,38,7
30010,Howard,18, Please be Cinderella. Please be Cinderella.,6,Big Bang Theory,44,6
30012,Howard,18, Milady.,6,Big Bang Theory,8,1
30014,Leonard,18," Hey, how was your what?",6,Big Bang Theory,24,5
30015,Penny,18," I can explain. I played hooky with the girls, then we all went to Disneyland and got What are you doing?",6,Big Bang Theory,105,21
30016,Leonard,18," Disneyland. Go on, I'm listening.",6,Big Bang Theory,34,5
30018,Amy,18," Sheldon, all Snow White needs is one little kiss to wake up.",6,Big Bang Theory,61,12
30019,Sheldon,18, Heard you the first time.,6,Big Bang Theory,26,5
30022,Howard,19, You said clean up. I'm cleaning up.,6,Big Bang Theory,36,7
30024,Howard,19," Hey, you can tell me what to do or you can tell me how to do it, but you can't do both. This isn't sex.",6,Big Bang Theory,104,25
30026,Howard,19, They're just coming over for dinner. No one's gonna look in the closet.,6,Big Bang Theory,72,13
30028,Howard,19, Could work out. For all we know there's a toilet in there somewhere.,6,Big Bang Theory,69,13
30030,Howard,19, You know what we should do? We should show the closet to Sheldon.,6,Big Bang Theory,66,13
30032,Howard,19," Are you kidding? He's like a savant at organizing. Everything in his apartment has a label on it. Including his label maker, which has a label that says label maker. And if you look really close at that label maker label, you'll see a label that says label.",6,Big Bang Theory,258,48
30034,Howard,19," No, we wouldn't ask him. We'd just show him the closet and let the goblins in his head take it from there.",6,Big Bang Theory,107,22
30035,Howard,19," Hey, guys, come on in.",6,Big Bang Theory,23,5
30037,Penny,19," Ooh, it smells good.",6,Big Bang Theory,21,4
30039,Sheldon,19," Oh, you shouldn't have.",6,Big Bang Theory,24,4
30041,Sheldon,19," No, you really shouldn't have. I brought my own.",6,Big Bang Theory,49,9
30043,Leonard,19, I had no choice. He kept kicking the back of my seat.,6,Big Bang Theory,54,12
30045,Sheldon,19," Well, now don't you feel silly.",6,Big Bang Theory,32,6
30048,Raj,19," These spring rolls are amazing. Good job, Bernadette.",6,Big Bang Theory,54,8
30050,Raj,19," Oh, well, I'm sure they wouldn't have tasted nearly as good if I hadn't tried your food first.",6,Big Bang Theory,95,18
30051,Sheldon,19," Howard, did you want your clothes arranged seasonally or by colour?",6,Big Bang Theory,68,11
30052,Howard,19, Colour's fine.,6,Big Bang Theory,15,2
30053,Sheldon,19," Wrong, they'll be arranged seasonally.",6,Big Bang Theory,39,5
30054,Penny,19," Sheldon, aren't you gonna spend a little time with Amy?",6,Big Bang Theory,56,10
30055,Amy,19," Oh, it's okay, I'm used to it. The other day at Whole Foods, he spent an hour optimizing the cheese aisle.",6,Big Bang Theory,107,21
30056,Sheldon,19," Yeah, and some thanks I got. The assistant manager chased me out with an artisanal salami.",6,Big Bang Theory,91,16
30057,Amy,19, His quirks just make you love him more. Someone please agree with me.,6,Big Bang Theory,70,13
30059,Leonard,19," Sheldon, come on. It's getting late. Time to go.",6,Big Bang Theory,49,9
30060,Sheldon,19," Oh, five more minutes.",6,Big Bang Theory,23,4
30061,Leonard,19, That's what you said five minutes ago. Amy and Penny are already in the car. Let's move it.,6,Big Bang Theory,92,18
30062,Sheldon,19, How come I never get to do anything I want to do?,6,Big Bang Theory,50,12
30063,Howard,19," You know, if he really wants to stay and finish, I can give him a ride home.",6,Big Bang Theory,77,17
30064,Sheldon,19," Please, Leonard, he said it's okay.",6,Big Bang Theory,36,6
30065,Leonard,19," Sheldon, it's, wait, I can go home without you? Bye.",6,Big Bang Theory,53,10
30066,Sheldon,19," Howard, I have a few questions. I found three bowling pins. Now, do you juggle these, or are you missing seven?",6,Big Bang Theory,112,21
30067,Howard,19, Juggle.,6,Big Bang Theory,8,1
30068,Sheldon,19, You health nuts kill me.,6,Big Bang Theory,25,5
30070,Sheldon,19," Uh, just a couple more items. Howard, I found this letter from your dad in a box. Now, based on the content, it could either be filed",6,Big Bang Theory,134,27
30071,Howard,19," Whoa, you opened this?",6,Big Bang Theory,23,4
30072,Sheldon,19," Well, I had to find out if it was personal correspondence or memorabilia. Now, as I was saying, based on the content",6,Big Bang Theory,117,22
30073,Howard,19," I couldn't be less interested. Now, come on, I'll take you home.",6,Big Bang Theory,65,12
30075,Howard,19," If I wanted to know, I would've opened it years ago. The closet looks great. Let's get out of here.",6,Big Bang Theory,100,20
30076,Sheldon,19," Wait, can I bring this box of extra shirt buttons to sort on the ride?",6,Big Bang Theory,71,15
30077,Howard,19, Do whatever you want.,6,Big Bang Theory,22,4
30078,Sheldon,19, Thanks. Oh. Great party.,6,Big Bang Theory,25,4
30080,Leonard,19," You know, when I first met Howard, he would pull his scrotum out of his shorts and say, aw, I sat in gum.",6,Big Bang Theory,106,23
30081,Penny,19, What is your point?,6,Big Bang Theory,20,4
30082,Leonard,19," Well, it's just kind of weird how grown up he is now. Happily married guy throwing dinner parties.",6,Big Bang Theory,99,18
30083,Penny,19, Really? You couldn't just say that? You had to tell the scrotum story?,6,Big Bang Theory,71,13
30084,Leonard,19, Trying to paint a picture.,6,Big Bang Theory,27,5
30085,Penny,19, It was a nice change of pace not eating takeout around a coffee table.,6,Big Bang Theory,71,14
30086,Leonard,19," Mm, you know, we could throw a dinner party, too. Maybe even ask everyone to get dressed up.",6,Big Bang Theory,93,18
30087,Penny,19," Sure. Just, when you say dressed up, you mean nice clothes, right? Not, like, capes and tights and crap?",6,Big Bang Theory,105,19
30088,Leonard,19, Yeah. Although,6,Big Bang Theory,15,2
30089,Penny,19, No.,6,Big Bang Theory,4,1
30092,Howard,19," Yeah, I just couldn't sleep.",6,Big Bang Theory,29,5
30094,Howard,19, It's this stupid letter.,6,Big Bang Theory,25,4
30096,Howard,19, No.,6,Big Bang Theory,4,1
30098,Howard,19," Of course I'm curious. I haven't seen the man since, oh, I was a little kid. And a letter shows up on my 18th birthday? What's that about?",6,Big Bang Theory,139,28
30100,Howard,19, He abandoned me and my mother. Why does he deserve a chance to explain anything?,6,Big Bang Theory,81,15
30102,Howard,19, Something I should have done a long time ago. ,6,Big Bang Theory,47,9
30104,Howard,19, Yep.,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
30106,Howard,19, I do.  Great. Neither one of us is tall enough to reach that.,6,Big Bang Theory,62,13
30108,Amy,19, I can't believe he set it on fire.,6,Big Bang Theory,35,8
30110,Amy,19," Boy, I'm really curious what was in that letter.",6,Big Bang Theory,49,9
30112,Amy,19," Well, you said Sheldon read it. Why not ask him?",6,Big Bang Theory,49,10
30114,Penny,19," What if I ask Sheldon, you just happen to be in the room?",6,Big Bang Theory,58,13
30116,Penny,19, Okay.,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
30118,Sheldon,19, Bleuch. Like cleaning out the entire building's belly button.,6,Big Bang Theory,62,9
30119,Penny,19," Hey, Sheldon.",6,Big Bang Theory,14,2
30120,Sheldon,19," Oh, hello. What can I do for you ladies?",6,Big Bang Theory,41,9
30121,Amy,19, You have something we want.,6,Big Bang Theory,28,5
30122,Sheldon,19," Oh, dear. My mother warned me this is what happens to pretty boys in the big city.",6,Big Bang Theory,83,17
30123,Penny,19," No, we just want information.",6,Big Bang Theory,30,5
30124,Sheldon,19," Oh. Oh, I've got that in spades. Ravage me.",6,Big Bang Theory,44,9
30125,Penny,19, We heard you read the letter from Howard's father.,6,Big Bang Theory,51,9
30126,Sheldon,19, I did.,6,Big Bang Theory,7,2
30127,Penny,19, What did it say?,6,Big Bang Theory,17,4
30128,Sheldon,19, I can't tell you that. I'm bound by closet organizer/organizee confidentiality.,6,Big Bang Theory,80,11
30129,Amy,19," Sheldon, that's not a real thing.",6,Big Bang Theory,34,6
30130,Sheldon,19," Well, neither is the rule that you have to hold your girlfriend's hand at the movies. You know. That doesn't stop you from pawing at me like you're a bear and I'm a trash can full of sweets.",6,Big Bang Theory,191,38
30131,Penny,19, Why do you even care? Just tell us what it says.,6,Big Bang Theory,49,11
30132,Sheldon,19," Control over the information contained in that letter belongs to Howard. By happenstance, I came to know it. That doesn't give me the right to disseminate it freely.",6,Big Bang Theory,166,28
30133,Penny,19," Come on. Look, the letter was found in Bernadette's closet. Doesn't that count for something?",6,Big Bang Theory,94,15
30134,Sheldon,19," Are you pointing out that California is a community property state, and since Howard and Bernadette are married, the intellectual property contained in that letter is jointly owned by the two spouses?",6,Big Bang Theory,201,32
30135,Penny,19," Yeah, obviously.",6,Big Bang Theory,17,2
30136,Sheldon,19," Well played. Sometimes I don't give you enough credit, Penny.",6,Big Bang Theory,62,10
30138,Raj,19," Dude, you made the right choice coming to me for help with this party.",6,Big Bang Theory,71,14
30139,Leonard,19," Actually, all I did was invite you.",6,Big Bang Theory,36,7
30140,Raj,19," Well, put your mind at ease. I'm here to make sure your dinner party kicks Howard's dinner party's ass. Now, the first thing we need is a theme. I'm thinking, ah, turn-of-the-century Moulin Rouge.",6,Big Bang Theory,197,34
30141,Leonard,19," I'm thinking you need a testosterone patch. Penny and I just want to do something low-key. You know, cocktails, light jazz music, hors d'oeuvres.",6,Big Bang Theory,146,24
30142,Raj,19, So your theme is I saw a rerun of Mad Men and bought some crab puffs from Trader Joe's? Hate to miss that.,6,Big Bang Theory,107,23
30143,Leonard,19," Hey, where have you been?",6,Big Bang Theory,26,5
30144,Sheldon,19," Oh, Leonard. If I was prone to sarcasm, I'd say I was pulling off a major heist at the museum of laundry baskets.",6,Big Bang Theory,114,23
30145,Leonard,19," One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. I meant, golly, Sheldon, you've been gone a long time.",6,Big Bang Theory,114,20
30146,Sheldon,19," Oh. Yeah, well, I was waylaid by Penny, Bernadette and Amy. They made me reveal confidential information about Howard's father.",6,Big Bang Theory,128,20
30147,Leonard,19, What information?,6,Big Bang Theory,18,2
30148,Sheldon,19, I can't tell you that. I am bound by closet organizer/organizee confidentiality.,6,Big Bang Theory,81,12
30149,Raj,19," Well, come on, we won't tell anyone.",6,Big Bang Theory,37,7
30150,Sheldon,19," Sorry, badgering me won't work. What you should have said is, It's pointless to keep this a secret because Penny will tell us.",6,Big Bang Theory,127,23
30151,Leonard,19," Fine, then that.",6,Big Bang Theory,17,3
30152,Sheldon,19," All right, I'll tell you. My goodness, everyone's on their game today.",6,Big Bang Theory,71,12
30154,Amy,19, This is really fun.,6,Big Bang Theory,20,4
30155,Raj,19," Yeah, it's nice to get dressed up once in a while.",6,Big Bang Theory,51,11
30156,Penny,19," Yeah, and the hors d'oeuvres are delightful.",6,Big Bang Theory,45,7
30157,Leonard,19, As is the company.,6,Big Bang Theory,19,4
30158,Penny,19, Aw.,6,Big Bang Theory,4,1
30159,Sheldon,19, My shirt is itchy and I wish I were dead.,6,Big Bang Theory,42,10
30160,Leonard,19," Hey, uh, listen, everybody. Before Howard gets here, et's all just agree to not bring up the letter from his father.",6,Big Bang Theory,117,21
30161,Raj,19, Of course.,6,Big Bang Theory,11,2
30162,Penny,19, Sure.,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
30163,Amy,19, Absolutely.,6,Big Bang Theory,12,1
30164,Sheldon,19," If I say yes, can we turn off that Latin orgy music?",6,Big Bang Theory,53,12
30166,Howard,19, Ridiculous that we still have to walk up all these flights of stairs.,6,Big Bang Theory,70,13
30168,Howard,19, I am.,6,Big Bang Theory,6,2
30170,Howard,19, What?,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
30172,Howard,19," Sheldon, I swear to God, I'm gonna kill you.",6,Big Bang Theory,45,9
30173,Amy,19, Hey.,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
30175,Howard,19, What? Us? Who else knows?,6,Big Bang Theory,26,5
30176,Penny,19, I know.,6,Big Bang Theory,8,2
30177,Amy,19," Me, too.",6,Big Bang Theory,9,2
30178,Leonard,19, Same here.,6,Big Bang Theory,11,2
30179,Raj,19, Shame on all of you.,6,Big Bang Theory,21,5
30180,Leonard,19," You know, too.",6,Big Bang Theory,15,3
30181,Raj,19," Couldn't leave him one friend, could you?",6,Big Bang Theory,42,7
30182,Howard,19, So everybody knows what's in that letter except for me?,6,Big Bang Theory,56,10
30183,Sheldon,19," Yes, it's six against one. Stand down, sir.",6,Big Bang Theory,44,8
30184,Howard,19, How could you do this?,6,Big Bang Theory,23,5
30186,Raj,19," If you want, we could tell you.",6,Big Bang Theory,32,7
30187,Howard,19," No, I don't want to know. I mean, I do, but I got to go.",6,Big Bang Theory,57,15
30188,Amy,19, Use me as a human shield!,6,Big Bang Theory,26,6
30189,Sheldon,19, I panicked. He looked taller than usual.,6,Big Bang Theory,41,7
30192,Howard,19, In here.,6,Big Bang Theory,9,2
30194,Howard,19, It's okay. Sorry I ran off like that.,6,Big Bang Theory,38,8
30196,Howard,19," Uh, pictures of my dad and me when I was a kid.",6,Big Bang Theory,48,12
30198,Howard,19," I got to tell you, as angry as I am at Sheldon for blabbing, he did a hell of a job organizing this closet. Look at this. Photos of Wolowitz family before father left forever. Check out nine-year-old Howie with cornrows. Neither race was happy to see me with those.",6,Big Bang Theory,266,50
30200,Howard,19, Why?,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
30202,Howard,19," Oh, honey, I am in no mood to have sex tonight. I'll lay there if you absolutely have to have it, but Oh. What are you guys doing here?",6,Big Bang Theory,136,29
30203,Leonard,19," When you left, you weren't sure whether or not you wanted to know what was in your dad's letter, so we came up with kind of a cool solution.",6,Big Bang Theory,141,29
30204,Howard,19," Oh, yeah, what's that?",6,Big Bang Theory,23,4
30205,Sheldon,19," It's simple, really. It occurred to me that knowing and not knowing can be achieved by creating a macroscopic example of quantum superposition. The, the principle that a physical system exists partially in all its possible states at once.",6,Big Bang Theory,239,39
30206,Penny,19," We were all thinking it, really. It was kind of the elephant in the room, so",6,Big Bang Theory,77,16
30207,Sheldon,19," Anyway, um, I realized that if we each present you with an account of what your father wrote to you, only one of which is true, and then we don't tell you which one it is, you will forever be in a state of epistemic ambivalence.",6,Big Bang Theory,229,46
30208,Penny,19," Yeah. And I said if it wasn't epistemic, we might as well not do it.",6,Big Bang Theory,69,15
30210,Leonard,19," Raj, you're up.",6,Big Bang Theory,16,3
30211,Raj,19," Okay, um, It was a card for your 18th birthday. Inside it said, Happy birthday, Howard. I love you. Dad. Oh, and it was a Far Side card, the one where the frog has its tongue stuck to the underside of an airplane. Thinks it's a fly. Silly frog. So funny.",6,Big Bang Theory,255,51
30212,Leonard,19, Sheldon.,6,Big Bang Theory,9,1
30213,Sheldon,19, It was a map leading to the lost treasure of famous pirate One-Eyed Willy.,6,Big Bang Theory,75,14
30214,Howard,19, Nice try. That's the plot for Goonies.,6,Big Bang Theory,39,7
30215,Amy,19, Told you.,6,Big Bang Theory,10,2
30216,Sheldon,19, Don't.,6,Big Bang Theory,7,1
30217,Leonard,19, Amy.,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
30218,Amy,19," You didn't know it, but your father was in the auditorium at your high school graduation. And he cried because he was so proud of you.",6,Big Bang Theory,135,26
30219,Howard,19, Really?,6,Big Bang Theory,8,1
30220,Sheldon,19, Or that's complete poppycock which Amy made up. It still could be the map.,6,Big Bang Theory,75,14
30221,Leonard,19, Penny.,6,Big Bang Theory,7,1
30222,Penny,19," It was a letter explaining that your dad wasn't who he said he was. Eventually, his other life caught up to him, and the only way to keep you and your mom safe was to leave.",6,Big Bang Theory,174,36
30223,Sheldon,19, I would like to change mine. The pirate's name was Peg-Leg Antoine. Now it's completely different from Goonies.,6,Big Bang Theory,112,18
30224,Amy,19," No, it's not.",6,Big Bang Theory,14,3
30225,Sheldon,19, Don't.,6,Big Bang Theory,7,1
30226,Leonard,19," Okay, my turn. Your dad wrote about how family is the most important thing, and that you should never throw it away like he did.",6,Big Bang Theory,129,25
30227,Howard,19, Hmm.,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
30228,Leonard,19, Bernadette.,6,Big Bang Theory,12,1
30230,Howard,19, Yeah. I'm terrific.,6,Big Bang Theory,20,3
30231,Leonard,19," So, which one do you think it is, matey?",6,Big Bang Theory,41,9
30232,Howard,19," Actually, I don't want to know. I want all of them to be true.",6,Big Bang Theory,63,14
30233,Leonard,19," Well, one of them is.",6,Big Bang Theory,22,5
30234,Howard,19," That's pretty cool. Thank you, guys.",6,Big Bang Theory,37,6
30235,Penny,19," Hey, it's still early. Why don't we go back and have that party?",6,Big Bang Theory,65,13
30236,Raj,19," Yeah,",6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
30237,Leonard,19," Yeah, cool.",6,Big Bang Theory,12,2
30238,Amy,19, Okay.,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
30239,Sheldon,19," You know, surprisingly, uh, the letter from your father wasn't the most interesting thing I read in the closet. Bernadette's diary has some saucy passages.",6,Big Bang Theory,156,25
30241,Sheldon,19, There's nothing to worry about. Your secret's safe with me.,6,Big Bang Theory,60,10
30243,Sheldon,19, Although copyright law would allow me to quote snippets in the context of a review.,6,Big Bang Theory,84,15
30246,Howard,19," Me, too. If I'd known we were gonna be dancing, would have worn my flats.",6,Big Bang Theory,74,15
30247,Penny,19," This turned out pretty well, huh?",6,Big Bang Theory,34,6
30248,Leonard,19," Yeah, I think so.",6,Big Bang Theory,18,4
30249,Raj,19," I agree. That is, if you've never been to or heard of a party before.",6,Big Bang Theory,70,15
30250,Amy,19," If you'd let me pierce your brain with a hot needle in the right place, you'd be happy all the time.",6,Big Bang Theory,101,21
30251,Sheldon,19," Uh, Penny, I, I have a couple of questions about your closet. Is there any reason you're keeping this dead goldfish?",6,Big Bang Theory,117,21
30252,Penny,19," Damn, I forgot to feed him. And that I had him.",6,Big Bang Theory,48,11
30253,Sheldon,19," Well, now, did you also have a dog? Because I found what appears to be a battery-operated chew toy.",6,Big Bang Theory,100,19
30254,Penny,19, Party's over! Party's over!,6,Big Bang Theory,28,4
30256,Leonard,20," I was reading about this jellyfish that never dies. Instead, it reverts to its asexual state and then grows up again.",6,Big Bang Theory,118,21
30257,Howard,20," We thought my 90-year-old grandfather had reverted to an asexual state, but the lawsuit from his Jamaican caregiver proved us all wrong.",6,Big Bang Theory,137,22
30258,Leonard,20," My point is, immortality is not only a possibility, it is real.",6,Big Bang Theory,64,12
30259,Raj,20, Only if you're this jellyfish which periodically reverts to a mass of undifferentiated protoplasm.,6,Big Bang Theory,99,14
30260,Sheldon,20," If I could keep my Gmail account, I'd be okay with that.",6,Big Bang Theory,57,12
30264,Howard,20, Yeah?,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
30266,Howard,20, That's terrible.,6,Big Bang Theory,17,2
30267,Leonard,20," Oh, my God.",6,Big Bang Theory,12,3
30269,Sheldon,20," If we're going to change the topic from jellyfish, I'd be okay with brine shrimp or the history of the unicycle.",6,Big Bang Theory,113,21
30270,Howard,20," Show a little compassion, a man died.",6,Big Bang Theory,38,7
30272,Sheldon,20," Excuse me, the whole tenure system is ridiculous. A guaranteed job for life only encourages the faculty to become complacent. If we really want science to advance, people should have chips implanted in their skulls that explode when they say something stupid.",6,Big Bang Theory,260,42
30273,Raj,20," Well, I believe people do their best work when they feel safe and secure.",6,Big Bang Theory,74,14
30274,Sheldon,20, Pchew!,6,Big Bang Theory,7,1
30276,Howard,20, You Ph.D's gonna go suck up like Kripke?,6,Big Bang Theory,41,8
30277,Leonard,20," No. I mean, I'll apply, but I'm not gonna stoop to playing politics.",6,Big Bang Theory,69,13
30278,Raj,20," Yeah, me neither. It should be about the work. And if I can't get tenure, I'd like to see you or Sheldon get it.",6,Big Bang Theory,113,24
30279,Sheldon,20," Raj, don't dangle false hope in front of Leonard like that.",6,Big Bang Theory,60,11
30280,Leonard,20," Excuse me, but I think I'm just as qualified as you are.",6,Big Bang Theory,57,12
30281,Sheldon,20, Pchew! Pchew! Pchew! Pchew!,6,Big Bang Theory,28,4
30283,Penny,20, So tenured means a job for life?,6,Big Bang Theory,33,7
30284,Leonard,20, Yup.,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
30285,Penny,20, You can't get fired even if you're bad at it?,6,Big Bang Theory,46,10
30286,Leonard,20," Mm, not really.",6,Big Bang Theory,16,3
30287,Penny,20," Wow, sounds a lot like being a pretty waitress at the Cheesecake Factory.",6,Big Bang Theory,74,13
30289,Sheldon,20," While I disagree with the premise of tenure, if they gave it to me, it wouldn't diminish my output. You know, I'm like the sun. Can't turn this off.",6,Big Bang Theory,149,29
30290,Amy,20, Are Rajesh and Leonard competing for it as well?,6,Big Bang Theory,49,9
30291,Sheldon,20, Mm-hmm.,6,Big Bang Theory,8,1
30292,Amy,20, Do they know they don't stand a chance 'cause you're so great?,6,Big Bang Theory,63,12
30293,Sheldon,20," Well put. You know, I must say I go back and forth on this boyfriend-girlfriend thing, but those moments when you worship me really keep you in the running.",6,Big Bang Theory,157,29
30295,Raj,20, It would be nice to have the increased income. Stop taking money from my parents.,6,Big Bang Theory,82,15
30296,Howard,20, Money from family does come with strings attached.,6,Big Bang Theory,51,8
30297,Raj,20," You have no idea. They buy me a new BMW for my birthday but can I get seat warmers? No. Rajesh, if you want a warm butt, you're gonna have to pay for it yourself. Well, maybe I will, old man.",6,Big Bang Theory,192,41
30300,Leonard,20, I just keep thinking about how cool it would be if I called my mom and told her that I got tenure at Caltech.,6,Big Bang Theory,110,24
30301,Penny,20," She'd be proud, huh?",6,Big Bang Theory,21,4
30302,Leonard,20," Oh, very. Assuming she takes my call.",6,Big Bang Theory,38,7
30304,Sheldon,20, My primary concern with being granted tenure is living with an insanely jealous roommate after the fact. I might need to sleep with a gun under my pillow. Or a chainsaw.,6,Big Bang Theory,170,31
30305,Amy,20," Or you take advantage of your newfound economic stability and move out, buy a house, get married. start a family.",6,Big Bang Theory,114,20
30306,Sheldon,20," Or, the chainsaw.",6,Big Bang Theory,18,3
30308,Raj,20," And I will return to New Delhi in triumph atop a bejeweled white elephant. And you know what will be on that elephant's back? A seat warmer. No, Father, you may not have a ride.",6,Big Bang Theory,178,35
30311,Penny,20," So, who do you have to schmooze to get this deal?",6,Big Bang Theory,50,11
30312,Leonard,20, I'm not gonna schmooze anybody. I'm gonna let my work speak for itself.,6,Big Bang Theory,72,13
30313,Penny,20, That's great. That shows a lot of integrity.,6,Big Bang Theory,45,8
30314,Leonard,20," Thank you. I'm a naive idiot, right?",6,Big Bang Theory,37,7
30315,Penny,20," Oh, good, you heard me.",6,Big Bang Theory,24,5
30317,Amy,20," You know, if you really want tenure, maybe you should cozy up to the people making the decision.",6,Big Bang Theory,97,18
30318,Sheldon,20, Sheldon Cooper does not do cozy.,6,Big Bang Theory,33,6
30319,Amy,20, You don't say.,6,Big Bang Theory,15,3
30320,Sheldon,20," But I suppose it wouldn't hurt to know who's on the committee. Let's see. Oh, Janine Davis. Oh, dear.",6,Big Bang Theory,102,19
30321,Amy,20, Is that a problem?,6,Big Bang Theory,19,4
30322,Sheldon,20, Well,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
30323,Sheldon,20, Even you. You're a slave.,6,Big Bang Theory,26,5
30325,Sheldon,20," I'm not sure, it could go either way.",6,Big Bang Theory,38,8
30327,Leonard,20, Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey. Mrs. Davis.,6,Big Bang Theory,33,3
30329,Leonard,20, Hey.,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
30331,Leonard,20, Yeah. Just thought I'd come down and start getting ready for swimsuit season.,6,Big Bang Theory,78,13
30333,Leonard,20, Not that you need it. I bet you look great in a swimsuit.,6,Big Bang Theory,58,13
30335,Leonard,20," I've got what my father used to call furniture disease. My chest is falling into my drawers. I'm not, uh, familiar with this model. How do I make it start?",6,Big Bang Theory,156,30
30337,Leonard,20, Right. This one might be broken.,6,Big Bang Theory,33,6
30339,Leonard,20," Got it. Oh. There. Oh, yeah. Yeah, now I'm feeling it. Oh, this is great. I could do this for the rest of my life. Hey, speaking, speaking of things you do for the rest of your life, uh, did I read that you're on that-that tenure committee?",6,Big Bang Theory,241,48
30341,Leonard,20," Well, I'm sure you have a lot of good applicants, I just wanted to say hi and let you know that I'll be throwing my hat in the ring.",6,Big Bang Theory,133,29
30343,Leonard,20, Yeah.,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
30345,Leonard,20, Go away.,6,Big Bang Theory,9,2
30348,Leonard,20," Well, look at that. Burned a whole calorie.",6,Big Bang Theory,44,8
30352,Leonard,20," Oh, if you, if you like banana bread, I've got a-a great recipe. The trick is in, in fresh ground, I'll e-mail it to you.",6,Big Bang Theory,122,25
30355,Leonard,20, That's enough cardio for me. I'm just gonna stretch out before I hit the weights.,6,Big Bang Theory,82,15
30357,Leonard,20, Call someone.,6,Big Bang Theory,14,2
30359,Raj,20," Good day, Mrs. Davis. This is Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali from the astrophysics department. Don't be alarmed, I'm not really in space. Anyhoo, I'd like to take this opportunity to tell you about myself, so sit back, relax and enjoy the following 90-minute video.",6,Big Bang Theory,259,43
30361,Raj,20," Born in New Delhi, the third son of an itinerant gynecologist, I showed early signs of genius. At the age of five I discovered a celestial object which later turned out to be the moon.",6,Big Bang Theory,185,35
30364,Sheldon,20," Yes, hello. I'm fine. Um, I understand you may have a bad impression of me, so I bought you a gift.",6,Big Bang Theory,100,21
30366,Sheldon,20, It's too late. Get ready to like me.,6,Big Bang Theory,37,8
30368,Sheldon,20, The tragic history of slavery in America. Fun for the whole family.,6,Big Bang Theory,68,12
30370,Sheldon,20," Um Well You are black, right?",6,Big Bang Theory,30,6
30372,Sheldon,20," Because you want to start watching it right now. Copy that. Let's see. Up next on the tenure committee is Professor Wu. Well, get ready for the complete works of Jackie Chan.",6,Big Bang Theory,175,32
30374,Leonard,20, Gentlemen.,6,Big Bang Theory,11,1
30375,Raj,20, Where have you been?,6,Big Bang Theory,21,4
30376,Leonard,20, Nurse's office.,6,Big Bang Theory,16,2
30377,Howard,20, Asthma attack?,6,Big Bang Theory,15,2
30378,Leonard,20," Asthma, heart, some kind of attack. I'm fine, though.",6,Big Bang Theory,54,9
30379,Howard,20, You guys going to Professor Tupperman's memorial?,6,Big Bang Theory,50,7
30380,Raj,20, I don't know.,6,Big Bang Theory,14,3
30381,Leonard,20, Probably not.,6,Big Bang Theory,14,2
30382,Sheldon,20, Barely knew him.,6,Big Bang Theory,17,3
30383,Howard,20," Yeah, you wouldn't want to look like you guys are brown-nosing the tenure committee, who will all be there. Oh, yeah, that's what I was hoping for, meerkats.",6,Big Bang Theory,158,28
30385,Sheldon,20," I won't be able to make our date night this Thursday, so, bad news for you.",6,Big Bang Theory,76,16
30386,Amy,20," Well you better have a good excuse this time, because trimming Q-tips to fit your ears right is obvious nonsense.",6,Big Bang Theory,114,20
30387,Sheldon,20," First of all, when you say things like that, people think you're crazy. Second, the reason I'm cancelling is because I have to attend a memorial service for Professor Tupperman.",6,Big Bang Theory,178,30
30388,Amy,20, It sounds like a long and tedious evening.,6,Big Bang Theory,43,8
30389,Sheldon,20," Eh, it will be. Honestly, if I must endure a long and tedious evening, I'd rather it be with you on date night. But I have no choice. The tenure committee's going to be there.",6,Big Bang Theory,176,35
30390,Amy,20," Oh. Well, in that case, perhaps I should come along.",6,Big Bang Theory,53,10
30391,Sheldon,20," Well, now that I think about it, that would be most helpful.",6,Big Bang Theory,61,12
30392,Amy,20," Of course it would. I'm well-versed in academic politics, and as a respected scientist, I can only raise your stock as a candidate.",6,Big Bang Theory,132,23
30393,Sheldon,20," Actually, I meant you could drive me. But if it makes you happy, that other stuff, too.",6,Big Bang Theory,88,17
30395,Leonard,20, Do anything interesting today?,6,Big Bang Theory,31,4
30396,Penny,20," Oh, not really. I was out shopping with Amy. She wanted me to help her find something for this memorial thing.",6,Big Bang Theory,111,21
30397,Leonard,20," Wait, Sheldon's going to be there? We all promised we weren't going to go.",6,Big Bang Theory,75,14
30398,Penny,20," Oh, what a jerk.",6,Big Bang Theory,17,4
30399,Leonard,20, I know. I was hoping to go without anyone finding out.,6,Big Bang Theory,55,11
30400,Penny,20," Well, since Amy's going, do you want me there? You know, to support you?",6,Big Bang Theory,73,14
30401,Leonard,20," Oh, that's nice, but it-it's just gonna be a room full of boring old men and I'm not sure how much help you'd be.",6,Big Bang Theory,114,24
30402,Penny,20, Okay. I'm just gonna tie my shoe while you think about that.,6,Big Bang Theory,61,12
30403,Leonard,20," Oh, yeah. No. Thanks, that would be great help. You realize you might kill some of them.",6,Big Bang Theory,89,17
30404,Penny,20," Oh, then you all can get tenure.",6,Big Bang Theory,33,7
30406,Raj,20," Come on, Daddy. All the other scientists have seat warmers. This is so humiliating. I've got to get tenure. Okay, let's meet halfway. How about I cut my cleaning lady down to twice a week? Looks like we're both going to be living like animals.",6,Big Bang Theory,244,45
30408,Amy,20, Let's go over our emotional responses one last time.,6,Big Bang Theory,53,9
30409,Sheldon,20, Okay.,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
30410,Amy,20," Professor Tupperman is dead, and that makes us?",6,Big Bang Theory,48,8
30411,Sheldon,20, Sad.,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
30412,Amy,20, The fact that there are so many people here tonight doesn't make us cranky and claustrophobic. It makes us?,6,Big Bang Theory,108,19
30413,Sheldon,20, Glad.,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
30414,Amy,20, Giving Mrs. Davis the box set of Roots was?,6,Big Bang Theory,44,9
30415,Sheldon,20, Bad. However,6,Big Bang Theory,13,2
30416,Amy,20, No.,6,Big Bang Theory,4,1
30417,Sheldon,20, Fine. Bad.,6,Big Bang Theory,11,2
30418,Raj,20, Unbelievable. You have some nerve showing up here just to schmooze with the tenure committee.,6,Big Bang Theory,94,15
30419,Sheldon,20, You're here.,6,Big Bang Theory,13,2
30420,Raj,20," Excuse me. I'm here to pay my respects to Professor Tupperware, or whatever his name is.",6,Big Bang Theory,89,16
30421,Sheldon,20, So am I. His passing makes me feel bad.,6,Big Bang Theory,40,9
30422,Leonard,20," Well, well, well, Sheldon, fancy meeting you here. I guess the train store in Glendale wasn't having a cotillion after all. And you, you said you weren't coming here, either.",6,Big Bang Theory,175,30
30423,Raj,20, I have a thick accent. You don't know what I said.,6,Big Bang Theory,51,11
30424,Amy,20, I'd like to know why Penny's here.,6,Big Bang Theory,35,7
30425,Penny,20," I'm here to support my man, just like you.",6,Big Bang Theory,43,9
30426,Sheldon,20, What are you going to do? Take people's drink orders and get them wrong?,6,Big Bang Theory,73,14
30427,Leonard,20, Do it.,6,Big Bang Theory,7,2
30428,Sheldon,20, What? Did she do it yet?,6,Big Bang Theory,25,6
30429,Amy,20, She plans on flirting with members of the tenure committee to further Leonard's cause.,6,Big Bang Theory,87,14
30430,Sheldon,20," Well, that's a fine how-do-you-do. Don't just stand there. Take your breasts out.",6,Big Bang Theory,82,13
30431,Howard,20," Ooh, meerkat fight!",6,Big Bang Theory,20,3
30432,Amy,20," You're all wasting your time. Sheldon is the most qualified for the job, and no amount of gravity-defying bosom's going to change that. Seriously, is that tape? Like, how are they staying up like that?",6,Big Bang Theory,202,35
30433,Leonard,20, Way to hit 'em with both barrels.,6,Big Bang Theory,34,7
30434,Raj,20," You two should be ashamed of yourselves. Using women to advance your cause with sexuality, and whatever Amy plans on doing.",6,Big Bang Theory,124,21
30435,Sheldon,20, Are you implying that my girlfriend has no sexuality to exploit?,6,Big Bang Theory,65,11
30436,Raj,20, Yes.,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
30437,Sheldon,20," Okay, because that was not clear.",6,Big Bang Theory,34,6
30438,Amy,20, Sheldon!,6,Big Bang Theory,9,1
30439,Sheldon,20, What? That was ambiguous.,6,Big Bang Theory,26,4
30440,Raj,20," Well, now it's biguous. What are you gonna do about it?",6,Big Bang Theory,56,11
30441,Sheldon,20, Um,6,Big Bang Theory,3,1
30442,Howard,20, You could talk some smack about his mother.,6,Big Bang Theory,44,8
30443,Sheldon,20," Well, yes, of course, he wouldn't like that at all. Last night, I was feeling in need of sexual release when I happened to come across your mother.",6,Big Bang Theory,148,28
30444,Leonard,20," Okay, okay. Guys, what are we doing here?",6,Big Bang Theory,42,8
30445,Sheldon,20," I don't know what you're doing, but I was about to insinuate that I had coitus with Raj's mother for a dollar.",6,Big Bang Theory,111,22
30446,Leonard,20," Oh, you do what you want, but I don't want to lose my friends over tenure. Friends are forever.",6,Big Bang Theory,96,19
30447,Howard,20, So is tenure.,6,Big Bang Theory,14,3
30449,Leonard,20, I'm just gonna go home and let my work speak for itself.,6,Big Bang Theory,57,12
30450,Raj,20, You're right. This is beneath me. Lie your mother was last night.,6,Big Bang Theory,66,12
30451,Leonard,20," How about it, Sheldon?",6,Big Bang Theory,23,4
30452,Sheldon,20, What do you think I should do?,6,Big Bang Theory,31,7
30453,Amy,20," Well, you'll always be an academic success, but I seriously question whether you'll make any more friends.",6,Big Bang Theory,107,17
30454,Sheldon,20," I don't want any more, but let's go.",6,Big Bang Theory,37,8
30458,Leonard,20, No. We cannot lose to that jerk.,6,Big Bang Theory,33,7
30459,Raj,20," Yeah, screw it. I'm going in.",6,Big Bang Theory,30,6
30460,Sheldon,20," Wait. Hold on. I believe screw it, I'm going in is what I said to your mother last night. Don't worry, I didn't really say that. I find the concept of coitus ridiculous and off-putting.",6,Big Bang Theory,186,35
30461,Amy,20, Should have taken my breasts out while I had the chance.,6,Big Bang Theory,57,11
30463,Sheldon,20,  Mrs Davis?  Mrs Davis?  Mrs Davis? I know you're in there. I saw your car in the parking lot.,6,Big Bang Theory,95,19
30465,Sheldon,20," I just found out that you recommended myself, Dr. Hofstadter and Dr. Koothrappali to be on the short list for tenure.",6,Big Bang Theory,118,21
30467,Sheldon,20," I don't know what you mean by quirks, but, um, I do want to express my gratitude.",6,Big Bang Theory,82,17
30469,Sheldon,20," No, no. No, I learned my lesson. I understand that was inappropriate.",6,Big Bang Theory,70,12
30471,Sheldon,20," Anyway, thank you.",6,Big Bang Theory,19,3
30473,Sheldon,20," Yeah, right on, sister.",6,Big Bang Theory,24,4
30475,Sheldon,21," Oh, dear. Penny, have you been recording shows on our DVR again?",6,Big Bang Theory,65,12
30476,Penny,21, No.,6,Big Bang Theory,4,1
30477,Sheldon,21, Answer honestly. This is not a trial. That'll come later.,6,Big Bang Theory,58,10
30478,Penny,21," Absolutely not. Help me out here, I can't afford another demerit.",6,Big Bang Theory,66,11
30479,Leonard,21," Yeah. Uh, maybe we were hacked. You know, the Chinese have been hacking everything lately.",6,Big Bang Theory,91,15
30480,Leonard,21, I don't know. It's a fat guy on a Segway. That's funny everywhere.,6,Big Bang Theory,67,13
30481,Sheldon,21, I'm deleting it.,6,Big Bang Theory,17,3
30482,Penny,21," Well, hang on. Maybe the Chinese haven't finished watching it yet.",6,Big Bang Theory,67,11
30483,Leonard,21," You know, if you're trying to make space on the DVR, why don't you just get rid of some of the stuff you've already watched? Like, um, Alphas.",6,Big Bang Theory,143,28
30484,Sheldon,21," No, that's the season two finale. That was quite the cliffhanger. I'm going to re-watch it before season three starts.",6,Big Bang Theory,119,20
30485,Leonard,21, There is no season three. They cancelled that show.,6,Big Bang Theory,52,9
30486,Sheldon,21," Well, they can't cancel it. It ended on a cliffhanger.",6,Big Bang Theory,55,10
30487,Leonard,21, They did.,6,Big Bang Theory,10,2
30488,Penny,21," Uh, Sheldon, there are two dumplings left. Do you want them?",6,Big Bang Theory,61,11
30489,Sheldon,21, Dumplings? Don't you understand what's going on here?,6,Big Bang Theory,54,8
30490,Penny,21," As a rule, no.",6,Big Bang Theory,15,4
30491,Sheldon,21," That show ended with all the residents of New York either dead or unconscious. Oh, now I'll never know what happened.",6,Big Bang Theory,118,21
30492,Penny,21," Well, why don't you make up your own ending?",6,Big Bang Theory,45,9
30493,Sheldon,21," Oh, sure, what a wonderful idea. And after that, I'll make up my own rules of oral hygiene. You know, instead of flossing, I'll rub pudding on my gums. I'm going to get the number of the SyFy Channel and give them what for.",6,Big Bang Theory,224,44
30494,Leonard,21," Oh, please, don't do that.",6,Big Bang Theory,27,5
30495,Sheldon,21, No. They can't just cancel a show like Alphas. You know? They have to help the viewers let go. Firefly did a movie to wrap things up. Buffy the Vampire Slayer continued on as a comic book. Heroes gradually lowered the quality season by season till we were grateful it ended.,6,Big Bang Theory,275,51
30496,Penny,21, I feel bad for whoever gets that phone call.,6,Big Bang Theory,45,9
30497,Leonard,21," Ah, don't. If they didn't want to be yelled at by crazy nerds, they shouldn't have started a sci-fi channel.",6,Big Bang Theory,109,20
30499,Howard,21," I think you're gonna be really happy with this security camera. The optics are great, it's got infrared technology, and there's even a backup battery when the power goes out.",6,Big Bang Theory,175,30
30500,Raj,21," Whatever. I can see my little princess while I'm at work, right?",6,Big Bang Theory,65,12
30501,Howard,21, Why can't you just watch porn like a regular guy? I need your laptop so I can configure the software.,6,Big Bang Theory,102,20
30502,Raj,21," Wait, hold on. This is weird.",6,Big Bang Theory,30,6
30503,Howard,21, What?,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
30504,Raj,21," I was Googling that girl I've been dating, and I found her blog.",6,Big Bang Theory,65,13
30505,Howard,21, Cool. Anything juicy?,6,Big Bang Theory,22,3
30506,Raj,21," She said she recently went on a date with a guy named Roger? And he's Indian? And he's an astrophysicist, too?",6,Big Bang Theory,111,21
30507,Howard,21," You know what's going on, don't you?",6,Big Bang Theory,37,7
30508,Raj,21," Yes, Mummy was right. American girls are sexually voracious devils.",6,Big Bang Theory,68,10
30509,Howard,21, I can't believe I have to explain this. People change names on blogs to protect their privacy. Roger is Raj.,6,Big Bang Theory,109,20
30510,Raj,21," Oh. I always thought, if I had a white name, it would be Gavin.",6,Big Bang Theory,64,14
30511,Howard,21, Keep reading. What does it say?,6,Big Bang Theory,32,6
30512,Raj,21," No, no, I don't know if I should. If she wanted me to know about her blog, she would've told me. It's almost like I'm reading her diary.",6,Big Bang Theory,137,28
30513,Howard,21, It's exactly what it's like. Keep reading.,6,Big Bang Theory,43,7
30514,Raj,21," No, this is creepy.",6,Big Bang Theory,20,4
30515,Howard,21," Oh, I think we were looking at creepy in the rearview mirror when I put up that camera.",6,Big Bang Theory,88,18
30516,Raj,21," It's not creepy. Don't listen to him. Oh, look who's got the sweetest kisses.",6,Big Bang Theory,78,14
30517,Howard,21, Should I go?,6,Big Bang Theory,13,3
30519,Leonard,21," With all the TV Sheldon was talking about, I had the greatest idea ever. It even blows away my idea for a Star Wars themed coffee shop called Brewbacca's. You need to watch Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It is the perfect show for the two of us. It's got action and jokes and hot vampires and romance. I cannot oversell this. What do you say?",6,Big Bang Theory,338,65
30520,Penny,21, It's six thirty in the morning.,6,Big Bang Theory,32,6
30521,Leonard,21, I thought you grew up on a farm.,6,Big Bang Theory,33,8
30523,Sheldon,21," Hello, SyFy Network? Yeah, this is your vice president of programming. Now, we have made a horrible mistake regarding Alphas. Yeah, we need to uncancel it immediately. Well, you just put me through to the people who handle that, you tell them it's me, and I don't want to answer a lot of questions about if I really am who I say I am, you know? I just. I want this done. No, I am not the person who just called. That man was clearly a cowboy. Yeah, who was plumb concerned about y'all cancelling his favourite show. Why do they keep hanging up on me?",6,Big Bang Theory,551,106
30524,Amy,21," I'm sorry you're upset. You know, Sheldon, sometimes people seek the comfort of physical contact in moments like this.",6,Big Bang Theory,119,19
30525,Sheldon,21, I am not flying back to Texas just so my mom can give me a hug.,6,Big Bang Theory,64,16
30526,Amy,21," Okay. Well, what I think is going on here is you have a pathological need for closure.",6,Big Bang Theory,87,17
30527,Sheldon,21," Oh, that's nonsense. I mean, you tell me stories about your day all the time. I don't care how they end.",6,Big Bang Theory,105,21
30528,Amy,21," You know, I might be able to help you with this. There's a whole field of behavioural neuroscience that examines ways to retrain your neural pathways so stuff like this bothers you less.",6,Big Bang Theory,187,33
30529,Sheldon,21," Yeah, but I just told you, I don't have a problem with closure.",6,Big Bang Theory,64,13
30530,Amy,21, You sure about that?,6,Big Bang Theory,21,4
30531,Sheldon,21," Oh, quite sure.  That proves nothing.",6,Big Bang Theory,38,6
30533,Howard,21, Ready to go to lunch?,6,Big Bang Theory,22,5
30534,Raj,21, Do you think I'm feminine?,6,Big Bang Theory,27,5
30535,Howard,21, Yeah. Let's go.,6,Big Bang Theory,16,3
30536,Raj,21, Thanks a lot.,6,Big Bang Theory,14,3
30537,Howard,21, What's going on?,6,Big Bang Theory,17,3
30538,Raj,21," I broke down, and I read Lucy's blog, and in one of the entries she said, when we first met, I struck her as a little feminine.",6,Big Bang Theory,128,27
30539,Howard,21, Just a little? That's great.,6,Big Bang Theory,29,5
30540,Raj,21, I have to talk to her about this.,6,Big Bang Theory,34,8
30541,Howard,21," Oh, geez, why do you girls always want to talk about things? Listen to me, if she's writing about your relationship, use it to your advantage. Rig the game.",6,Big Bang Theory,157,29
30542,Raj,21," Well, that doesn't seem fair.",6,Big Bang Theory,30,5
30543,Howard,21," Is it fair that girls like confident, normal guys more than nervous weirdos?",6,Big Bang Theory,77,13
30544,Raj,21," No, it's not. I've always thought that was unfair.",6,Big Bang Theory,51,9
30545,Howard,21, So take what's in that blog and use it to get her pants off.,6,Big Bang Theory,61,14
30546,Raj,21, Why do you have to make everything so filthy? Why couldn't you just say the blog is like her giving me the key to her heart?,6,Big Bang Theory,125,26
30547,Howard,21, The key to her heart. That's nice. Were you quoting someone or is it tattooed on the small of your back?,6,Big Bang Theory,105,21
30548,Raj,21," I was quoting a man who knows a thing or two about women, Sir Elton John.",6,Big Bang Theory,74,16
30550,Leonard,21," So, did you love it? Of course you loved it. How could you not love it? Tell me how much you loved it.",6,Big Bang Theory,103,23
30551,Penny,21, It was cute.,6,Big Bang Theory,13,3
30552,Leonard,21," Oh, don't say cute. That's the worst.",6,Big Bang Theory,38,7
30553,Penny,21, What's wrong with cute?,6,Big Bang Theory,24,4
30554,Leonard,21, It just makes things seem small. It diminishes them.,6,Big Bang Theory,53,9
30555,Penny,21, So you want me to stop calling your little tushy cute?,6,Big Bang Theory,55,11
30556,Leonard,21," You can try, but nobody's gonna believe you. I just, I don't understand how you can watch a show that great and not be excited by it.",6,Big Bang Theory,134,27
30557,Penny,21, I liked it. I'm excited.,6,Big Bang Theory,25,5
30558,Leonard,21," Well, then, tell your face.",6,Big Bang Theory,28,5
30559,Penny,21, What do you want from me?,6,Big Bang Theory,26,6
30560,Leonard,21, You know what? Never mind. We gave it a shot. Let's just see what else is on.,6,Big Bang Theory,78,17
30561,Penny,21," Oh, come on, don't be like that.",6,Big Bang Theory,33,7
30562,Leonard,21, Well,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
30563,Penny,21, I'm sorry I called it cute. Let's watch another one.,6,Big Bang Theory,53,10
30564,Leonard,21, Really?,6,Big Bang Theory,8,1
30565,Penny,21," Yeah, it was fun. Kind of reminded me of my high school. But instead of vampires, we had meth heads. But both came out at night and had messed up teeth.",6,Big Bang Theory,153,31
30566,Leonard,21," All right, cool. I think you'll like the next one better. All the cheerleaders are suffering from an evil curse.",6,Big Bang Theory,113,20
30567,Penny,21," Oh. Well, that's like my high school, too. But instead of a curse, it was crabs.",6,Big Bang Theory,81,16
30569,Amy,21, I've come up with a series of exercises to help with your compulsive need for closure.,6,Big Bang Theory,87,16
30570,Sheldon,21, I take issue with the word compulsive.,6,Big Bang Theory,39,7
30571,Amy,21," All I'm saying is, we live in a world where closure isn't always an op",6,Big Bang Theory,71,15
30572,Sheldon,21," tion. Okay. For the sake of argument, let's say I have a problem. What would be your plan for addressing it?",6,Big Bang Theory,109,21
30573,Amy,21, I'm going to recondition your brain so that the need for completion isn't so overwhelming.,6,Big Bang Theory,91,15
30574,Sheldon,21, By playing tic-tac-toe?,6,Big Bang Theory,24,3
30575,Amy,21, Yep. Your turn.,6,Big Bang Theory,16,3
30576,Sheldon,21," Oh, Amy. And you wonder why people think neuroscience is nothing but a goofy game for diaper babies. Tic-tac-toe can only end in win, lose or draw, none of which will deny me closure. Especially since I'm about to win.  B-But we didn't finish.",6,Big Bang Theory,244,44
30577,Amy,21, Exactly. How does that make you feel?,6,Big Bang Theory,38,7
30578,Sheldon,21, The same way any normal person would. I feel like I want to peel off my own face and tear it in two and then again and again until I have a handful of Sheldon-face confetti.,6,Big Bang Theory,174,36
30579,Amy,21, And that's exactly the feeling we want to address with this course of treatment.,6,Big Bang Theory,81,14
30580,Sheldon,21," Or you could pitch in, grab a nostril and help me get this face off.",6,Big Bang Theory,69,15
30581,Amy,21," Come on, you can do this.",6,Big Bang Theory,26,6
30582,Sheldon,21, You don't know what it's like to feel completely frustrated. To have a desire build up within you and be denied any opportunity for release.,6,Big Bang Theory,141,25
30583,Amy,21," Yeah, sounds like a drag.",6,Big Bang Theory,26,5
30585,Penny,21," Okay, help me out here. Why does he love this show so much?",6,Big Bang Theory,60,13
30587,Penny,21," Yippee, it's backwards. I get it.",6,Big Bang Theory,34,6
30589,Penny,21," I don't know. It's just, he's so passionate about so many different things. I just don't get that way. Do you?",6,Big Bang Theory,111,21
30591,Penny,21," See? I wish I had some of that fire in my life. I mean, I want to care about things and get excited like you guys.",6,Big Bang Theory,115,26
30593,Penny,21, You think?,6,Big Bang Theory,11,2
30595,Penny,21," Ugh, that sounds like a lot of work.",6,Big Bang Theory,37,8
30597,Howard,21," Hey, what's up?",6,Big Bang Theory,16,3
30598,Raj,21," Uh, Lucy's coming over. I need some advice.",6,Big Bang Theory,44,8
30599,Howard,21," However long you think the foreplay should be, triple it.",6,Big Bang Theory,58,10
30600,Raj,21, Just tell me which one you think is more manly. This hockey jersey or this football jersey.,6,Big Bang Theory,92,17
30601,Howard,21, I don't know. Go with hockey.,6,Big Bang Theory,30,6
30602,Raj,21," Good, black is more slimming. Oh, that's her. I got to go be butch. Toodles. Hey.",6,Big Bang Theory,82,16
30604,Raj,21, Come in.,6,Big Bang Theory,9,2
30606,Raj,21," Yeah, well, I wouldn't get too close. If I give the right command in German, she'll rip your face off.",6,Big Bang Theory,103,20
30610,Sheldon,21, Yes.,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
30611,Amy,21, Let's box it up.,6,Big Bang Theory,17,4
30612,Sheldon,21, Let's box it up.,6,Big Bang Theory,17,4
30615,Sheldon,21," Lucky for you, 'cause I wished you were dead.",6,Big Bang Theory,46,9
30618,Raj,21, Thanks. I love hockey.,6,Big Bang Theory,23,4
30620,Raj,21," Not Brian Boitano, that's for sure. How's your burrito?",6,Big Bang Theory,56,9
30622,Raj,21, Probably because I didn't read the instructions. No wrapper's going to tell me what to do. Unless his name is Jay-Z.,6,Big Bang Theory,117,21
30624,Raj,21, What do you mean?,6,Big Bang Theory,18,4
30626,Raj,21, I don't know. Maybe it's all those steroids I've been taking.,6,Big Bang Theory,62,11
30628,Raj,21," Wait, wait. I, I found your blog here you wrote about me.",6,Big Bang Theory,58,12
30630,Raj,21," No kidding. You didn't make it easy to find. I spent hours digging around online. For the record, you have excellent credit scores. And your diabetic aunt seems to be adjusting to her new leg just fine.",6,Big Bang Theory,203,37
30632,Raj,21," You called me feminine. And I, I wanted you to think I was more manly.",6,Big Bang Theory,71,15
30634,Raj,21, I do have a pretty balls-to-the-wall moisturising regimen.,6,Big Bang Theory,59,8
30636,Raj,21, Yeah.,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
30638,Raj,21, No. Bought this at the Staples Center when I went to see Taylor Swift.,6,Big Bang Theory,71,14
30640,Penny,21," So, I was thinking how excited you get about stuff like Buffy or science or which TV remote you and Sheldon should buy.",6,Big Bang Theory,120,23
30641,Leonard,21," The Harmony One was fine. We didn't need to upgrade to the eleven hundred, which he knows is too big for my hand.",6,Big Bang Theory,114,23
30642,Penny,21," See, that's the kind of passion I didn't think I had. But then I realized I'm passionate about you.",6,Big Bang Theory,100,19
30643,Leonard,21," Oh, my cute little tushy strikes again.",6,Big Bang Theory,40,7
30644,Penny,21," No, I'm serious. Look, I've always had these plans. I was gonna be in movies and live this glamorous life, and anything less than that just wasn't worth getting excited about.",6,Big Bang Theory,176,31
30645,Leonard,21, Those things can still happen.,6,Big Bang Theory,31,5
30646,Penny,21," Oh, obviously it's gonna happen. Yeah, a psychic at a bachelorette party told me so. Anyway, what I meant was, I shouldn't wait, you know? I've got you, I've got Sheldon, all these wonderful friends. My life is exciting right now.",6,Big Bang Theory,231,41
30647,Leonard,21, That's a big deal.,6,Big Bang Theory,19,4
30648,Penny,21," It is, isn't it?",6,Big Bang Theory,17,4
30649,Leonard,21," So, does that mean we get to do stuff like talk about cool shows or get dressed up in matching costumes and go to Comic-Con?",6,Big Bang Theory,125,25
30650,Penny,21," Leonard, I had an epiphany, not a stroke.",6,Big Bang Theory,42,8
30652,Sheldon,21," Amy, I must say, I was sceptical at first, but this has truly been a transformative evening.",6,Big Bang Theory,93,17
30653,Amy,21, I'm a little surprised to hear you feeling so positive.,6,Big Bang Theory,56,10
30654,Sheldon,21," Well, you're an excellent neuroscientist, you're a wonderful girlfriend, and",6,Big Bang Theory,77,10
30655,Amy,21, And?,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
30656,Sheldon,21," Doesn't matter, does it?",6,Big Bang Theory,25,4
30657,Amy,21," I'm proud of you, Sheldon. ",6,Big Bang Theory,28,5
30658,Sheldon,21, And a complete sucker.,6,Big Bang Theory,23,4
30663,Penny,21," Sheldon, you big weirdo, I want you to know that I love that you're in my life.",6,Big Bang Theory,80,17
30664,Sheldon,21," I love you, too.",6,Big Bang Theory,17,4
30666,Sheldon,21," Hello. Uh, is this the Bruce Miller who wrote the season finale of Alphas? Oh, smashing. Yeah, you already sound nicer than the last Bruce Miller who suggested I have sexual relations with myself. Now, down to business. Um, your show ended on a cliffhanger. Could you please tell me how you planned to resolve it? Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. I see. Well, that all stinks. No wonder you got cancelled. Bye.",6,Big Bang Theory,394,70
30668,Leonard,22," The interface is pretty simple. You put your horizontal X coordinate here, vertical Y coordinate here. When you're happy with those, you press this button.",6,Big Bang Theory,156,25
30669,Penny,22, Got it.,6,Big Bang Theory,8,2
30670,Sheldon,22," Leonard, you'll never guess who I just found online. Hey!",6,Big Bang Theory,58,10
30671,Leonard,22, Nice shot.,6,Big Bang Theory,11,2
30672,Penny,22," Eh, his giant head did most of the work.",6,Big Bang Theory,41,9
30673,Sheldon,22," Very mature. You're lucky I'm out of silly string. As I was saying, Leonard, you'll never guess who I just found online. Professor Proton.",6,Big Bang Theory,139,24
30674,Leonard,22, You're kidding. He's still alive?,6,Big Bang Theory,34,5
30675,Sheldon,22, Yes.,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
30676,Penny,22, Who's Professor Proton?,6,Big Bang Theory,24,3
30677,Leonard,22, He was the host of this great Hey!,6,Big Bang Theory,35,8
30678,Penny,22," Yes! Sorry, tell me about Professor Proton.",6,Big Bang Theory,44,7
30679,Sheldon,22, Professor Proton hosted my favourite science show when I was a child. I never missed an episode. He demonstrated scientific principles using everyday objects.,6,Big Bang Theory,159,24
30680,Leonard,22, It was pretty cool.,6,Big Bang Theory,20,4
30681,Penny,22," Aw, so cute when you use the word cool wrong. Like when kids say pasghetti.",6,Big Bang Theory,76,15
30682,Sheldon,22," Oh, dear lord, Leonard, look. He's still available for parties and events. We should hire him.",6,Big Bang Theory,95,16
30683,Leonard,22, Hire him to do what?,6,Big Bang Theory,21,5
30684,Sheldon,22," Well, whatever we want. Hang out, do experiments, make him take 12 pictures with us so we can make a calendar.",6,Big Bang Theory,111,21
30685,Leonard,22," It would be pretty awesome to hang out with him. I just used awesome wrong, didn't I?",6,Big Bang Theory,86,17
30686,Sheldon,22," Well, I'm e-mailing him right now.",6,Big Bang Theory,35,6
30687,Leonard,22, Do you remember his old theme song?,6,Big Bang Theory,36,7
30688,Sheldon,22, Of course I do.,6,Big Bang Theory,16,4
30691,Raj,22," Hey, I just found out I have to be at the telescope lab all weekend. Any chance you and Bernadette could take care of my dog?",6,Big Bang Theory,126,26
30692,Howard,22, Why don't you put her in a kennel?,6,Big Bang Theory,35,8
30693,Raj,22, Why don't you put your mother in a home?,6,Big Bang Theory,41,9
30694,Howard,22," To be honest, she'd do better in the kennel. I'll talk to Bernie. I'm sure it's fine.",6,Big Bang Theory,86,17
30695,Raj,22, Thank you.,6,Big Bang Theory,11,2
30696,Sheldon,22," It's happening. Leonard, it's happening. Professor Proton is coming to our house.",6,Big Bang Theory,82,12
30697,Leonard,22, You're kidding.,6,Big Bang Theory,16,2
30698,Howard,22, You mean the guy who used to host that lame kids show?,6,Big Bang Theory,55,12
30699,Sheldon,22, And you just got yourself uninvited. See? I told you I'd find a tactful way to do that.,6,Big Bang Theory,88,18
30700,Howard,22, How'd you get him to come to your house?,6,Big Bang Theory,41,9
30701,Sheldon,22," As Professor Proton always says, there is no problem you can't solve if you use your noggin.",6,Big Bang Theory,93,17
30702,Leonard,22, And he wrote him a cheque.,6,Big Bang Theory,27,6
30703,Sheldon,22," Yeah, that, too. Big cheque.",6,Big Bang Theory,29,5
30705,Raj,22, Uncle Howard. Cinnamon's here for her sleepover party.,6,Big Bang Theory,55,8
30706,Howard,22," You know if you had a stroke, she'd eat you, right?",6,Big Bang Theory,52,11
30707,Raj,22, And it would be my pleasure to be her num-num.,6,Big Bang Theory,47,10
30708,Howard,22," Okay, so what do I need to know to take care of her?",6,Big Bang Theory,53,13
30709,Raj,22," It's very simple. For breakfast, she has an egg-white frittata. Feel free to give her a choice of home fries or an English muffin, but not both. We're watching our weight. Uh, for dinner, something simple, a veal chop, some scampi, whatever you like.",6,Big Bang Theory,251,44
30710,Howard,22, Classy dog.,6,Big Bang Theory,12,2
30711,Raj,22," Yes. Also, don't forget to close the toilet or she'll drink out of it.",6,Big Bang Theory,71,14
30714,Sheldon,22," Leonard, are you in bed?",6,Big Bang Theory,25,5
30715,Leonard,22, Yes.,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
30716,Sheldon,22," Me, too.",6,Big Bang Theory,9,2
30717,Leonard,22, Great.,6,Big Bang Theory,7,1
30718,Sheldon,22, I can't sleep.,6,Big Bang Theory,15,3
30719,Leonard,22," Well, I can, so shut up.",6,Big Bang Theory,25,6
30720,Sheldon,22," Do you realize that in less than nine hours, Arthur Jeffries, aka Professor Proton, will be in our apartment?",6,Big Bang Theory,110,19
30721,Leonard,22," Sheldon, you know that if you stay up all night, you're gonna be sleepy tomorrow. And a sleepy Sheldon is a cranky Sheldon. And a cranky Sheldon is actually no different than a regular Sheldon. Good night.",6,Big Bang Theory,206,37
30722,Sheldon,22, I'm thinking of wearing a tuxedo.,6,Big Bang Theory,34,6
30723,Leonard,22, That's not ridiculous. Good night.,6,Big Bang Theory,35,5
30724,Sheldon,22, Do you have cufflinks?,6,Big Bang Theory,23,4
30725,Leonard,22, No.,6,Big Bang Theory,4,1
30726,Sheldon,22," Ah, just as well. Where can you rent a tuxedo at three o'clock in the morning?",6,Big Bang Theory,79,16
30727,Leonard,22," Okay, good night.",6,Big Bang Theory,18,3
30728,Sheldon,22," Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, Prof Ow! Leonard?",6,Big Bang Theory,144,25
30729,Leonard,22, What?,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
30730,Sheldon,22, I still can't sleep.,6,Big Bang Theory,21,4
30732,Howard,22," She really tuckered herself out at the park, huh?",6,Big Bang Theory,50,9
30734,Howard,22, It was kind of fun throwing a ball and not having anyone laugh at me.,6,Big Bang Theory,70,15
30736,Howard,22," Yeah, that's what I was doing.",6,Big Bang Theory,31,6
30738,Howard,22, Really?,6,Big Bang Theory,8,1
30740,Howard,22," Of course we can. Especially if our baby's as calm and quiet as little Cinna Son of a bitch, she's gone.",6,Big Bang Theory,105,21
30742,Howard,22," I don't know, she didn't leave a note.",6,Big Bang Theory,39,8
30744,Howard,22," No, I wasn't. You were.",6,Big Bang Theory,24,5
30746,Howard,22," Yes, you were!.",6,Big Bang Theory,16,3
30749,Sheldon,22, I'm getting worried.,6,Big Bang Theory,21,3
30750,Penny,22," Relax, Sheldon, he's only a few minutes late.",6,Big Bang Theory,46,8
30751,Sheldon,22," Professor Proton was never late when he was on TV. You know, every day, four o'clock, he was there. Unless tornadoes were ripping apart East Texas, in which case we'd join him in progress.  It's him. Hello. Well, I see. Yes. All right, we can come get you. Yeah, well, see you soon. Bye.",6,Big Bang Theory,288,54
30752,Leonard,22, Where is he?,6,Big Bang Theory,13,3
30753,Sheldon,22, The third floor landing. The poor old guy's been walking up the stairs for half an hour. It's really you.,6,Big Bang Theory,106,20
30754,Leonard,22," Mr. Jeffries, I am so sorry. We should've told you about the broken elevator.",6,Big Bang Theory,78,14
30756,Sheldon,22," Professor Proton, it's an honour to meet you.",6,Big Bang Theory,46,8
30758,Sheldon,22," Leonard, you hear that? Professor Proton said I should call him Arthur. That means we're friends.",6,Big Bang Theory,98,16
30760,Sheldon,22, Look at me. I can get as close to you as I want without my mom saying it's going to ruin my eyes.,6,Big Bang Theory,98,23
30762,Leonard,22," Actually, he's a genius.",6,Big Bang Theory,25,4
30763,Sheldon,22, I am.,6,Big Bang Theory,6,2
30765,Leonard,22," Mr. Jeffries, I'm, I'm Leonard. This is my girlfriend, Penny.",6,Big Bang Theory,62,10
30767,Penny,22, Hello.,6,Big Bang Theory,7,1
30769,Sheldon,22," Oh, no, there are no kids. No, the, the show's for me. Come on. I'll race ya, Arthur.",6,Big Bang Theory,86,18
30771,Leonard,22," Yes, sir.",6,Big Bang Theory,10,2
30773,Penny,22," So, do you do a lot of appearances like this?",6,Big Bang Theory,46,10
30775,Leonard,22, We just wanted to hang out with you and maybe learn a little about your life.,6,Big Bang Theory,78,16
30777,Leonard,22," That's too bad. But still, working with kids, it must be rewarding.",6,Big Bang Theory,68,12
30779,Sheldon,22," Yes. And if there's time, take 12 pictures with us in seasonal clothing.",6,Big Bang Theory,73,13
30781,Sheldon,22," Yeah, that's great. Did you bring your puppet?",6,Big Bang Theory,47,8
30783,Sheldon,22," Oh, no. How could anybody hate Gino the Neutrino? It's nice, huh? I got him for 20 bucks on eBay. Including the shipping!",6,Big Bang Theory,122,23
30787,Howard,22, Cinnamon!,6,Big Bang Theory,10,1
30789,Howard,22," Good thinking.  Cinnamon, come to Daddy.",6,Big Bang Theory,41,6
30791,Howard,22, Nice.,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
30793,Howard,22," When this all blows over, remember that voice. It's kind of a turn-on.",6,Big Bang Theory,71,13
30795,Howard,22, Cinnamon!,6,Big Bang Theory,10,1
30798,Penny,22, I think I know.,6,Big Bang Theory,16,4
30799,Sheldon,22, It's gonna get sucked in. It's going to get sucked in.,6,Big Bang Theory,55,11
30800,Penny,22," Okay, I didn't know.",6,Big Bang Theory,21,4
30801,Sheldon,22, Yes.,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
30802,Penny,22," See, I'm not a scientist like them.",6,Big Bang Theory,36,7
30804,Sheldon,22, Potato clock. Do potato clock.,6,Big Bang Theory,31,5
30805,Penny,22, What's that?,6,Big Bang Theory,13,2
30807,Penny,22," Shut up. You can do that? I mean, wouldn't that solve the world's energy crisis?",6,Big Bang Theory,81,15
30809,Sheldon,22," What, well what's wrong? Is she upsetting you? Because I can make her go away.",6,Big Bang Theory,79,15
30811,Leonard,22, Then what is it?,6,Big Bang Theory,17,4
30813,Sheldon,22," Well, how can you say that? Professor Proton's the best.",6,Big Bang Theory,57,10
30815,Penny,22, I'm sorry to hear about your troubles.,6,Big Bang Theory,39,7
30817,Penny,22," But if you don't mind me asking, uh, the potato clock, how does it work? Is it a trick clock or a trick potato?",6,Big Bang Theory,112,24
30819,Sheldon,22," I wrote a fan letter to you when I was a child in Texas, and you sent this autographed picture back to me. Do you remember that?",6,Big Bang Theory,129,27
30821,Sheldon,22," Well, anyway, um, you may find this hard to believe, but I didn't have any friends growing up.",6,Big Bang Theory,95,18
30823,Sheldon,22," But, um, I did have you. And every day at four o'clock, you'd come to my house on Channel 68, and we'd do science together. If it hadn't been for you, well, who knows what would've become of me? You know? Instead of a world-class physicist, I could've wound up as a hobo. Or a surgeon.",6,Big Bang Theory,286,56
30824,Leonard,22," I bet there are important discoveries being made every day because you inspired millions of kids to pursue science. In a way, their discoveries are your discoveries.",6,Big Bang Theory,166,27
30825,Sheldon,22," Yeah, it's true. A generation of young scientists are standing on your shoulders.",6,Big Bang Theory,82,13
30827,Leonard,22, It's important you know how much you mean to us.,6,Big Bang Theory,49,10
30829,Penny,22," Arthur, are you okay?",6,Big Bang Theory,22,4
30831,Leonard,22," I'll, I'll call for help.",6,Big Bang Theory,26,5
30832,Penny,22, Any chance we could plug it into the potato?,6,Big Bang Theory,45,9
30835,Raj,22," Hello? What do you mean, you found my dog? She's with my friends. Is she okay? Oh, thank you. Uh, just text me your address, I'm on my way. Oh, and if she's hungry, go ahead and feed her. But do not give her anything starchy. She's having risotto for dinner.",6,Big Bang Theory,259,51
30838,Leonard,22, You want one of us to go with you in the ambulance?,6,Big Bang Theory,52,12
30839,Sheldon,22, I'll do it.,6,Big Bang Theory,12,3
30842,Sheldon,22," Oh, yeah.",6,Big Bang Theory,10,2
30844,Penny,22, We'll pack up your stuff and meet you at the hospital.,6,Big Bang Theory,55,11
30845,Leonard,22, I'm sorry things turned out this way.,6,Big Bang Theory,38,7
30847,Sheldon,22," Met my childhood hero, now I get to ride in an ambulance. Boy, if we can get him to do that calendar, this'll be the best day ever.",6,Big Bang Theory,132,28
30850,Howard,22," Well, maybe with the first one. But kids are like pancakes. The first one's always a throwaway. How's this look?",6,Big Bang Theory,113,20
30852,Howard,22," It's not her. I just googled foo-foo little dogs.  It's Raj. Stay quiet. Hey, bad timing. Bernadette just took Cinnamon out for a walk.",6,Big Bang Theory,136,24
30853,Raj,22, Hmm. Interesting. Did they take a walk down Liars' Lane?,6,Big Bang Theory,57,10
30854,Howard,22, What?,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
30855,Raj,22," A lane frequented by liars. Like you, you big liar.",6,Big Bang Theory,52,10
30856,Howard,22, You have her?,6,Big Bang Theory,14,3
30858,Raj,22," Well, I trusted you, and you let me down. The poor thing's been shaking for hours.",6,Big Bang Theory,83,16
30859,Howard,22, I'm really sorry.,6,Big Bang Theory,18,3
30861,Raj,22," Yes. I picked her up, and then we both went for massages to try and calm down. And then we got Pinkberry.",6,Big Bang Theory,106,22
30863,Raj,22," Well, I, I thought about",6,Big Bang Theory,25,5
30865,Raj,22," Sorry. I, I just",6,Big Bang Theory,17,4
30867,Howard,22, Nice guilt trip. You are gonna be an amazing mom.,6,Big Bang Theory,50,10
30869,Sheldon,22," Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr.",6,Big Bang Theory,89,15
30871,Sheldon,22, Want me to sing it again?,6,Big Bang Theory,26,6
30873,Sheldon,22," There anything I can get for you? Some apple juice? Uh, some Jell-O?",6,Big Bang Theory,69,13
30875,Sheldon,22, Name it.,6,Big Bang Theory,9,2
30877,Sheldon,22," Oh, you're not. You look awful.",6,Big Bang Theory,32,6
30879,Sheldon,22, Are you saying that you want me to be Professor Proton?,6,Big Bang Theory,56,11
30881,Sheldon,22," Oh, my. What an honour. Oh, this is like being asked to ascend Mount Olympus and dine with the gods.",6,Big Bang Theory,101,20
30883,Sheldon,22," But they'll know I'm not you. Should I call myself Professor Proton, Jr.?",6,Big Bang Theory,74,13
30885,Sheldon,22," So, in a way it's like I'm your son.",6,Big Bang Theory,37,9
30887,Sheldon,22, Father.,6,Big Bang Theory,8,1
30891,Penny,23," Vegas, here we come.",6,Big Bang Theory,21,4
30893,Amy,23," No rules? We're not gonna get drunk and have a six-way with the Blue Man Group, are we?",6,Big Bang Theory,88,18
30894,Penny,23, No.,6,Big Bang Theory,4,1
30895,Amy,23, So there are some rules.,6,Big Bang Theory,25,5
30897,Amy,23, Thank you. Vegas!,6,Big Bang Theory,18,3
30899,Howard,23," The ladies are away, the boys will play.",6,Big Bang Theory,41,8
30900,Raj,23, Anything can happen.,6,Big Bang Theory,21,3
30901,Leonard,23, It's gonna get crazy.,6,Big Bang Theory,22,4
30902,Sheldon,23, Dungeons & Dragons.,6,Big Bang Theory,20,3
30904,Penny,23," I got a brand-new bikini, so drinks at the pool are on these.",6,Big Bang Theory,62,13
30906,Amy,23, I got some old underwear I'm gonna throw on stage at the Garth Brooks concert.,6,Big Bang Theory,79,15
30907,Penny,23," I'm sorry, why old?",6,Big Bang Theory,20,4
30908,Amy,23," â€˜Cause last time I saw him, I threw new ones and it got me nothing.",6,Big Bang Theory,70,15
30910,Sheldon,23," I've got a brand-new seven piece set of polyhedral dice. Hello, new dice smell.",6,Big Bang Theory,80,14
30911,Leonard,23," I've got my helm of lordly might, my boots of speed, and if things get too exciting, my inhaler of asthma.",6,Big Bang Theory,107,21
30912,Raj,23," I got my new bloodthirsty savage warrior who will lay waste to all who stand before him. And I had a sensible salad for lunch, so I can eat all the pizza I want.",6,Big Bang Theory,162,34
30913,Howard,23," Come on, are we gonna sit around chatting like a bunch of teenage girls, or are we gonna play D&D like a bunch of teenage boys who are never gonna have sex with those teenage girls?",6,Big Bang Theory,182,36
30919,Raj,23, I'm actually glad Lucy had to work tonight. Saved me the awkward conversation about how I was gonna be hanging with my bros.,6,Big Bang Theory,125,23
30920,Howard,23, Isn't every conversation you two have awkward?,6,Big Bang Theory,47,7
30921,Raj,23," Painfully so. We have this rule on the phone that if no one talks for three minutes, you can just hang up. So into her.",6,Big Bang Theory,120,25
30922,Howard,23, Ready whenever you guys are.,6,Big Bang Theory,29,5
30923,Sheldon,23," Yeah, yeah, we'll be right there. Leonard?",6,Big Bang Theory,43,7
30924,Leonard,23, Yeah?,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
30925,Sheldon,23, I'm not sure how I feel about Howard being dungeon master instead of you.,6,Big Bang Theory,74,14
30926,Leonard,23," Oh, that's nice. But relax, sometimes change is good. Uh, you were worried about Zachary Quinto being the new Spock, but you wound up liking him.",6,Big Bang Theory,146,26
30927,Sheldon,23," Oh, please. Every time the topic of change comes up, you throw Zachary Quinto in my face. I'm upset the mailman has a new haircut, Zachary Quinto. I'm upset that daylight saving time started, Zachary Quinto. I'm upset daylight saving time ended, Zachary Quinto. I'm saying this for the last time, Zachary Quinto was a weird, wonderful, unrepeatable event. So stop using him against me.",6,Big Bang Theory,386,65
30928,Howard,23," Okay, here we go. You find yourselves in an overgrown old forest. Before you is a giant oak tree with a face on it that looks a lot like Nicolas Cage. He says,  Travel with caution. These woods are home to the bones of many a fallen hero.",6,Big Bang Theory,239,48
30929,Leonard,23," See, Howard's just as good a dungeon master as I am.",6,Big Bang Theory,53,11
30930,Sheldon,23," As good? You just got pantsed in the schoolyard, four-eyes.",6,Big Bang Theory,60,10
30931,Raj,23," Hey, come on, guys, focus. Um, uh, oh, mighty Nicolas Cage tree, we thank you for your warning, but we are brave warriors, and nothing short of death will keep us from our goal.  Oh, Lucy's free after all. See ya.",6,Big Bang Theory,214,41
30932,Leonard,23," Hey, hey, hey, you can't leave. We just started.",6,Big Bang Theory,49,9
30933,Raj,23," You're right, I should finish the game. I take my plus-one long sword, stab myself in the face with it. I'm dead, I've got a date with a girl. Bye.",6,Big Bang Theory,148,30
30934,Howard,23," We'll be fine, watch. Suddenly, a spectral shape rises from Koothrappali's bloody corpse, and says,  don't worry, buddies, ghost Raj will help guide you through the forest.  Well, I'm just a tree, but if I were you, I'd listen to your ghost friend.",6,Big Bang Theory,249,43
30935,Sheldon,23," Go on, give him your lunch money.",6,Big Bang Theory,34,7
30937,Raj,23, I'm very happy you were able to hang out tonight.,6,Big Bang Theory,50,10
30939,Raj,23," Not that it's up to you to make me happy. Uh, well, unless you find neediness sexy. In which case, you're about to have dinner with the hottest man on the planet.",6,Big Bang Theory,163,32
30941,Raj,23, Really?,6,Big Bang Theory,8,1
30943,Raj,23," I, uh, I'm sorry to put you through that.",6,Big Bang Theory,42,9
30945,Raj,23, What else have you been thinking about doing?,6,Big Bang Theory,46,8
30947,Raj,23, I like your bangs.,6,Big Bang Theory,19,4
30949,Raj,23, What else?,6,Big Bang Theory,11,2
30951,Raj,23," Mm, yeah. Those are both toughies.",6,Big Bang Theory,35,6
30954,Leonard,23, I push my shoulder against the secret door to see if it gives way.,6,Big Bang Theory,67,14
30955,Howard,23," Uh, it does. ",6,Big Bang Theory,14,3
30956,Sheldon,23," He does sound effects, too!",6,Big Bang Theory,28,5
30957,Leonard,23," Hey, I always did sound effects. A-A swarm of bloodthirsty bats fly through the dungeon.  Uh, uh, they attack a nearby unicorn. ",6,Big Bang Theory,129,22
30958,Sheldon,23," Okay, well, I have a sound effect for those sound effects. ",6,Big Bang Theory,60,11
30959,Penny,23, Guess who?,6,Big Bang Theory,11,2
30960,Howard,23, What are you doing back?,6,Big Bang Theory,25,5
30962,Amy,23," Uh, well, when we were going through security, I got pulled out of line for a pat-down. The, uh, TSA agent got a little handsy. I may have broken her nose with my elbow.",6,Big Bang Theory,170,34
30964,Amy,23, I'm sorry. I feel like such an idiot.,6,Big Bang Theory,38,8
30965,Penny,23," Oh, it's not so bad. You lost money, you're filled with shame and you got groped by a stranger. I mean, that's Vegas, you nailed it.",6,Big Bang Theory,133,26
30966,Amy,23, You guys enjoy your evening. I'm gonna go before I ruin anybody else's weekend.,6,Big Bang Theory,80,14
30967,Sheldon,23," Ah, that's my girl.",6,Big Bang Theory,20,4
30968,Leonard,23," No, no, no, Amy, wait. I know it's not the night you had in mind, but why don't you guys stay and play with us? It'll be fun.",6,Big Bang Theory,126,28
30969,Sheldon,23," It would? Fun? Okay, three weeks ago you bought crunchy peanut butter, now you want the girls to play D&D? Do you have a drug problem?",6,Big Bang Theory,135,26
30970,Leonard,23," What's the big deal? Raj bailed, so we could use some extra players.",6,Big Bang Theory,69,13
30971,Sheldon,23," Well, I've just never played Dungeons & Dragons with girls before.",6,Big Bang Theory,67,11
30972,Penny,23," Oh, don't worry, sweetie. No one has.",6,Big Bang Theory,38,7
30973,Leonard,23," So, what do you say?",6,Big Bang Theory,21,5
30974,Sheldon,23, I'll leave it up to the dungeon master.,6,Big Bang Theory,40,8
30975,Howard,23," A satanic fungus that looks suspiciously like Al Pacino rises from the forest floor and says,  You're playing D&D. You're playing D&D. This whole apartment is playing D&D.",6,Big Bang Theory,172,28
30977,Penny,23," Okay, who wants a drink?",6,Big Bang Theory,25,5
30978,Sheldon,23," Yeah, we, now, Penny, we don't consume alcohol during Dungeons & Dragons. It impairs our judgment.",6,Big Bang Theory,99,16
30979,Penny,23," Oh, this isn't alcohol. It's a magic potion that makes me like you.",6,Big Bang Theory,68,13
30980,Leonard,23," Double potion, please.",6,Big Bang Theory,23,3
30981,Howard,23," Okay, here we go. You find yourselves face-to-face with two hulking ogres. What are you doing in our dungeon? You shall die!",6,Big Bang Theory,125,22
30982,Sheldon,23," Okay, literal goose bumps. Look.",6,Big Bang Theory,33,5
30983,Howard,23, What do you do?,6,Big Bang Theory,16,4
30984,Leonard,23, I draw my broadsword.,6,Big Bang Theory,22,4
30985,Sheldon,23, I ready my quarter-staff.,6,Big Bang Theory,26,4
30986,Penny,23, I drink my potion.,6,Big Bang Theory,19,4
30988,Penny,23," You know what? Give me the dice, I want to roll.",6,Big Bang Theory,49,11
30989,Howard,23, The dungeon master's supposed to roll.,6,Big Bang Theory,39,6
30990,Penny,23," Yeah, well I'm supposed to be in Vegas throwing up on a shrimp buffet. Now give it. All right, what do I need?",6,Big Bang Theory,111,23
30991,Howard,23," Uh, fifteen or higher.",6,Big Bang Theory,23,4
30992,Penny,23," Fifteen's the point, the point is fifteen. Give the little lady some room, here it is, coming out. Sixteen! Yes! Oh, please tell me we're playing for money.",6,Big Bang Theory,157,28
30993,Sheldon,23," Oh, even better than money. You gained experience points.",6,Big Bang Theory,58,9
30994,Penny,23," More potion, please.",6,Big Bang Theory,21,3
30995,Leonard,23, Yeah.,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
30997,Raj,23, How are your crab cakes?,6,Big Bang Theory,25,5
30999,Raj,23, That's great.,6,Big Bang Theory,14,2
31001,Raj,23," No, no. Uh, you've always wanted to send your food back in a restaurant, here's your chance.",6,Big Bang Theory,93,17
31003,Raj,23, Don't be ridiculous. Waiter?,6,Big Bang Theory,29,4
31008,Raj,23, Hold on. Isn't there something else you wanted to tell him?,6,Big Bang Theory,60,11
31010,Raj,23, Don't be silly. Just tell him.,6,Big Bang Theory,31,6
31013,Raj,23," Uh, yeah, sorry. She's just a little shy. The first time we met, she was so nervous, she climbed out a bathroom window to get away from me.",6,Big Bang Theory,140,28
31018,Howard,23," Seventeen, the larger ogre is dead. The-the other ogre says, you killed my brother, now Ogre Thanksgiving is ruined.",6,Big Bang Theory,117,19
31019,Sheldon,23, That is amazing. He made me care about the ogre.,6,Big Bang Theory,49,10
31020,Leonard,23," All right, Amy, there's one ogre left. Take him out.",6,Big Bang Theory,53,10
31021,Amy,23, Okay.,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
31022,Penny,23, Pretend he's that TSA agent. Come on.,6,Big Bang Theory,38,7
31023,Amy,23," Nineteen. Yes, this is turning out to be even better than Vegas.",6,Big Bang Theory,65,12
31024,Penny,23," No, it's not.",6,Big Bang Theory,14,3
31026,Raj,23, Lucy?,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
31028,Raj,23," You don't know me very well, but each time you crawl out a bathroom window to escape my company, it chips away at my masculinity.",6,Big Bang Theory,130,25
31030,Raj,23, Why would you leave like that?,6,Big Bang Theory,31,6
31032,Raj,23," Okay, if I upset you, then why didn't you just say something?",6,Big Bang Theory,62,12
31034,Raj,23," Yeah, well, I like you a lot, and that's scary for me. Mostly because you're a proven flight risk.",6,Big Bang Theory,99,19
31036,Raj,23," Well, uh, for one thing, you have bigger emotional problems than I do, and I find that very attractive in a woman. I, I don't know. I just, I think you're wonderful.",6,Big Bang Theory,166,32
31039,Howard,23," The dragon falls from the sky, crashing into the volcano.",6,Big Bang Theory,58,10
31040,Sheldon,23, Yay!,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
31041,Howard,23," But wait., he's not dead. He crawls out, spreads his wings and prepares to attack.",6,Big Bang Theory,83,15
31042,Sheldon,23," Yeah, uh, wait. Doesn't he say something first? You know, maybe in the voice of a beloved celebrity?",6,Big Bang Theory,101,18
31043,Howard,23," Fine.  You'd think, after all these years, I'd know not to fly over volcanoes. I'm a freaking idiot.",6,Big Bang Theory,101,18
31044,Sheldon,23, The dragon's Christopher Walken. That's perfect.,6,Big Bang Theory,49,6
31045,Leonard,23," All right, Amy, it's your turn. We need one more hit. Finish him off.",6,Big Bang Theory,70,14
31046,Amy,23, Here we go. Fifteen?,6,Big Bang Theory,21,4
31047,Howard,23, It's a hit. The dragon collapses to the ground.,6,Big Bang Theory,48,9
31048,Sheldon,23, Wait. Wait. And says?,6,Big Bang Theory,22,4
31049,Howard,23, Mother? Is that you? Your little boy is coming home.,6,Big Bang Theory,53,10
31050,Sheldon,23," Oh, I don't know about you guys, but I have been through the emotional wringer tonight.",6,Big Bang Theory,88,16
31052,Howard,23," Oh, yeah? Well, when we get home, I'm gonna take you on a whole different adventure.",6,Big Bang Theory,85,16
31053,Sheldon,23, Another quest by Wolowitz? Count me in.,6,Big Bang Theory,40,7
31054,Amy,23," Sheldon, they're talking about sex.",6,Big Bang Theory,36,5
31055,Sheldon,23," Oh, then I'm out.",6,Big Bang Theory,18,4
31056,Penny,23," Ooh, I have an idea. Since it's not happening any time soon, why don't your character and your character do it in the game?",6,Big Bang Theory,124,24
31058,Howard,23, Oh.,6,Big Bang Theory,4,1
31061,Leonard,23," Ooh! Sorry, I thought you were gonna do that.",6,Big Bang Theory,46,9
31062,Howard,23," The love spell takes effect. When Sheldon looks at Amy, she is the most beautiful half-orc he's ever seen, and he's overcome with a desire to rip her armour off and gaze fondly at her four hairy breasts. When Amy sees Sheldon, he looks, well, just like Sheldon, 'cause apparently she's into that. What do you do?",6,Big Bang Theory,313,57
31063,Amy,23, I don't like this.,6,Big Bang Theory,19,4
31064,Sheldon,23, You see what happens when you let girls play D&D?,6,Big Bang Theory,50,10
31066,Sheldon,23,  Amy.  Amy.  Amy.,6,Big Bang Theory,18,3
31067,Amy,23, What?,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
31068,Sheldon,23, I've never knocked on my own door before. That was a wild ride.,6,Big Bang Theory,64,13
31069,Amy,23, You don't have to come in here and cheer me up.,6,Big Bang Theory,48,11
31070,Sheldon,23, Thank you. Would you go tell everyone else that? Because they sure think otherwise.,6,Big Bang Theory,84,14
31071,Amy,23, I'll tell you what they think. They think our relationship is a joke.,6,Big Bang Theory,70,13
31072,Sheldon,23," Well, I don't think our relationship is a joke. I think â€œa horse goes into a bar, bartender says, why the long face?', that's a joke. It's a good one, too, because a horse has a long face.",6,Big Bang Theory,191,38
31073,Amy,23," Sheldon, are we ever going to have an intimate relationship?",6,Big Bang Theory,61,10
31074,Sheldon,23," Oh, my. That's an uncomfortable topic. Amy, before I met you, I never had any interest in being intimate with anyone.",6,Big Bang Theory,118,21
31075,Amy,23, And now?,6,Big Bang Theory,9,2
31076,Sheldon,23, And now what?,6,Big Bang Theory,14,3
31077,Amy,23, Do you have any interest now?,6,Big Bang Theory,30,6
31078,Sheldon,23, I have not ruled it out.,6,Big Bang Theory,25,6
31079,Amy,23, Wow. Talk dirty to me.,6,Big Bang Theory,23,5
31080,Sheldon,23," I know it doesn't seem like it to you, but, for me, what we have is extremely intimate.",6,Big Bang Theory,88,18
31081,Amy,23," I guess I know that. It's just, part of me wants more.",6,Big Bang Theory,55,12
31082,Sheldon,23," More? I mean, look at us. It's only been three years, here we are in bed together.",6,Big Bang Theory,83,17
31083,Amy,23, Come on. Let's go back out there.,6,Big Bang Theory,34,7
31084,Sheldon,23," Well, no. Hold on. My Elven magic-user and your half-orc warrior did have a love spell cast on them. We wouldn't really be playing the game right if we didn't see that through.",6,Big Bang Theory,177,33
31085,Amy,23, Okay.,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
31086,Sheldon,23," I believe that, uh, we just killed a dragon. While the others pillage the corpse, I lead you to a secluded area where I attempt to remove your leather armour.  It comes off.",6,Big Bang Theory,174,33
31087,Amy,23, Oh.,6,Big Bang Theory,4,1
31088,Sheldon,23, What do you do?,6,Big Bang Theory,16,4
31089,Amy,23, I kiss you on the lips.,6,Big Bang Theory,24,6
31090,Sheldon,23, I kiss you back on the  lips as well. Your turn.,6,Big Bang Theory,49,11
31091,Amy,23, I remove your armour. What do you do?,6,Big Bang Theory,38,8
31092,Sheldon,23, I erotically caress your  nose.,6,Big Bang Theory,32,5
31093,Amy,23, Keep rolling.,6,Big Bang Theory,14,2
31095,Leonard,23," Hey, you guys have been in there for a while. You doing okay?",6,Big Bang Theory,62,13
31096,Sheldon,23," We're fine, thank you.",6,Big Bang Theory,23,4
31097,Penny,23," Okay, we just want to say, we feel really bad about",6,Big Bang Theory,52,11
31098,Amy,23, Go away! Sheldon is nibbling on my  14! Yes!,6,Big Bang Theory,45,9
31100,Raj,24," So, anyway, last night on video chat, I spent, like, twenty minutes just staring into Lucy's eyes.",6,Big Bang Theory,99,17
31101,Leonard,24," Oh, that sounds romantic.",6,Big Bang Theory,26,4
31102,Raj,24, It was until I realized the screen had frozen. Still one of my top three dates of all time.,6,Big Bang Theory,92,19
31103,Leonard,24," So, are we ever gonna hang out with this girl?",6,Big Bang Theory,47,10
31104,Raj,24," I'd love that, but she's not really comfortable around people.",6,Big Bang Theory,63,10
31105,Sheldon,24," Yeah, I used to be uncomfortable around people, but then I learned a trick. I pretend everyone I meet is a beloved character from Star Trek.",6,Big Bang Theory,141,26
31106,Leonard,24, How's that been working for you?,6,Big Bang Theory,33,6
31107,Sheldon,24," Oh, like a charm, unnamed crewman in a red shirt.",6,Big Bang Theory,50,10
31108,Howard,24," Leonard, I may have gotten you a job.",6,Big Bang Theory,38,8
31109,Leonard,24, I have a job.,6,Big Bang Theory,14,4
31110,Sheldon,24," Yes, he does. He caters to my every whim.",6,Big Bang Theory,42,9
31111,Howard,24," No, in a couple of weeks, Stephen Hawking's team is sending an expedition to the North Sea to test hydrodynamic simulations of black holes. One of their experimental physicists dropped out, and I recommended you.",6,Big Bang Theory,213,35
31112,Leonard,24," Well, do you really think I have a shot?",6,Big Bang Theory,41,9
31113,Howard,24," Yeah, I've worked with Hawking. I talked you up. He knows your research. I think this could happen.",6,Big Bang Theory,100,18
31114,Leonard,24," He knows, wow.",6,Big Bang Theory,15,3
31115,Sheldon,24," Well, now, but do you think that's a good idea? Uh, you know Star Trek. Should a guy with no name and a red shirt really go on an expedition?",6,Big Bang Theory,142,30
31116,Raj,24," Hey, don't discourage him. This is a fantastic opportunity.",6,Big Bang Theory,60,9
31117,Sheldon,24," No one asked you, Uhura.",6,Big Bang Theory,25,5
31119,Sheldon,24, Would you like to hear a classic Sheldon Cooper factoid?,6,Big Bang Theory,57,10
31120,Leonard,24, What do you think?,6,Big Bang Theory,19,4
31121,Sheldon,24, Great. I've been doing some reading about vehicular safety. Did you know that the highest number of drowning accidents happen on or around boats?,6,Big Bang Theory,146,24
31122,Leonard,24, Interesting that you would bring that up when I might go work on a boat.,6,Big Bang Theory,73,15
31123,Sheldon,24," Well, that's the thing about factoids, they're interesting.",6,Big Bang Theory,60,8
31124,Leonard,24, I know what you're doing. You don't want me going on this research trip because you're afraid to be alone.,6,Big Bang Theory,107,20
31125,Sheldon,24," I'm not afraid to be alone. On land. On the sea, it would be terrifying. Because of all the drowning.",6,Big Bang Theory,102,20
31126,Leonard,24, Sheldon.,6,Big Bang Theory,9,1
31127,Sheldon,24," Fine, no more drowning talk. I'll change the subject. Oh. Who do you think would win in a fight, you or a shark?",6,Big Bang Theory,113,23
31128,Leonard,24," Look, I appreciate your signature blend of concern for me and incredible selfishness. If I get the chance to do this, there is nothing you can say that's going to stop me.",6,Big Bang Theory,172,32
31129,Sheldon,24," Very well. Things between you and Penny have never been better. I hope four months apart doesn't change anything. I should have opened with that, huh?",6,Big Bang Theory,151,26
31131,Raj,24," If you look carefully at Venus, you should be able to see the International Space Station pass by.",6,Big Bang Theory,99,18
31133,Raj,24, Yeah. He brought me back a T-shirt that said My Friend Went to the Space Station and All I Got Was This Lousy T-Shirt,6,Big Bang Theory,118,24
31135,Raj,24," Nope. It's exactly as lousy as advertised. Speaking of friends, they have been asking to meet you. I was thinking maybe we could all hang out sometime?",6,Big Bang Theory,152,27
31137,Raj,24," Let's see. Six. That's pretty cool, I have six friends. Kind of like Sinatra.",6,Big Bang Theory,78,14
31139,Raj,24," Okay, how about you just dip your toe in and meet one of them?",6,Big Bang Theory,63,14
31141,Raj,24, Of course.,6,Big Bang Theory,11,2
31144,Penny,24," So, then, during my afternoon shift, I spilled an entire tray of drinks on myself.",6,Big Bang Theory,83,15
31145,Leonard,24," Oh, that's awful.",6,Big Bang Theory,18,3
31146,Penny,24," Not really. My shirt was soaking wet. I got, like, the biggest tip of my life.",6,Big Bang Theory,79,16
31147,Leonard,24," So, listen, do you remember when I said the similarities of the equations of general relativity and hydrodynamics suggest you could find the equivalent of Unruh radiation in a large body of water?",6,Big Bang Theory,197,33
31148,Penny,24, I thought I said that to you.,6,Big Bang Theory,30,7
31149,Leonard,24," Anyway, Stephen Hawking's team is looking into that, and I've been invited to join them.",6,Big Bang Theory,89,15
31150,Penny,24," Wow, Hawking. Good for you.",6,Big Bang Theory,28,5
31151,Leonard,24," Well, it is. Just, you know, I'd be gone for a while.",6,Big Bang Theory,54,12
31152,Penny,24," Well, how long?",6,Big Bang Theory,16,3
31153,Leonard,24," Three, four months.",6,Big Bang Theory,20,3
31154,Penny,24, Whoa. When would you leave?,6,Big Bang Theory,28,5
31155,Leonard,24, Couple of weeks.,6,Big Bang Theory,17,3
31156,Penny,24," Wow. Oh, okay, well, I'll just come visit you.",6,Big Bang Theory,47,9
31157,Leonard,24," That's the thing, you can't. I'll be on a ship in the North Sea.",6,Big Bang Theory,65,14
31158,Penny,24, On a ship? Aren't they afraid Hawking will just roll overboard?,6,Big Bang Theory,64,11
31159,Leonard,24," Uh, he's not gonna be there. He's just sending a team to research his theory.",6,Big Bang Theory,78,15
31160,Penny,24," Oh, sure. Like when you send me to kill spiders in your bathtub. Wow. Okay. Four months.",6,Big Bang Theory,89,17
31161,Leonard,24," Yeah. And I'm a little worried because things between us have been so great, and I'd hate to do anything that screws that up.",6,Big Bang Theory,126,24
31162,Penny,24," Oh, sweetie, if you're gonna screw things up, it's gonna be while you're here, not while you're away. No. I mean, look, you have to go. It sounds like an amazing opportunity. And I'm just basing that on how much I didn't understand what you said about it.",6,Big Bang Theory,256,48
31163,Leonard,24, Okay. I'll confirm the travel arrangements in the morning.,6,Big Bang Theory,59,9
31164,Penny,24, Okay. Good.,6,Big Bang Theory,12,2
31165,Leonard,24, I do have to ask you one favour.,6,Big Bang Theory,33,8
31166,Penny,24, Sure.,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
31167,Leonard,24, Sheldon's nervous about me leaving. Just keep an eye on him while I'm gone.,6,Big Bang Theory,76,14
31168,Penny,24," Oh, I don't know. Remember what happened when I took care of your goldfish?",6,Big Bang Theory,76,14
31169,Leonard,24," Well, flush Sheldon down the toilet and get me a new one.",6,Big Bang Theory,58,12
31171,Leonard,24," Really, you guys do not need to throw me a going-away party.",6,Big Bang Theory,61,12
31172,Howard,24, Are you kidding me? How often can you say bon voyage to somebody when they're actually going on a voyage?,6,Big Bang Theory,106,20
31173,Amy,24," Hello, Rajesh.",6,Big Bang Theory,15,2
31174,Howard,24," Hello, Amy. Nice to see you. What can I say? It's funnier with the accent.",6,Big Bang Theory,75,15
31175,Leonard,24," There's beer in the fridge. Anyway, you guys really don't need to make a big deal.",6,Big Bang Theory,83,16
31176,Sheldon,24," Leonard, you're being selfish. We need to give you a proper send-off so we'll have closure when you die at sea and crabs eat your face.",6,Big Bang Theory,136,26
31177,Penny,24," Sheldon, sweetie, shut up.",6,Big Bang Theory,27,4
31179,Penny,24," Bernadette, sweetie, shut up.",6,Big Bang Theory,30,4
31180,Raj,24, Okay. I have a request to make.,6,Big Bang Theory,32,7
31181,Amy,24, And now he can talk. I want to cut open your brain and see what the heck's going on in there.,6,Big Bang Theory,94,21
31182,Raj,24," The only person allowed inside this head is Dr. Phil. Anyway, I, I spoke to my new lady friend about meeting you all, and she thought it would be easier for her to start with just one.",6,Big Bang Theory,185,37
31183,Sheldon,24," Oh, gee, I don't know. My schedule's a little busy.",6,Big Bang Theory,52,10
31184,Raj,24," Actually, I was thinking Leonard.",6,Big Bang Theory,34,5
31185,Leonard,24," Oh. Thank you, Raj. I'd be honoured.",6,Big Bang Theory,37,7
31186,Howard,24, What the hell? I thought I was your best friend.,6,Big Bang Theory,49,10
31187,Raj,24," You are, but you've got kind of a big personality, with your flashy clothes and your Woody Allen swagger.",6,Big Bang Theory,106,19
31188,Penny,24," You know, maybe she'd be more comfortable meeting a girl first.",6,Big Bang Theory,64,11
31189,Raj,24, Good idea. Bernadette?,6,Big Bang Theory,23,3
31190,Penny,24, What the hell?,6,Big Bang Theory,15,3
31191,Raj,24," Well, you're very pretty. That could be intimidating to another woman.",6,Big Bang Theory,71,11
31192,Penny,24," Oh, yeah.",6,Big Bang Theory,10,2
31194,Howard,24," Calm down, Bernie. You're very scary.",6,Big Bang Theory,38,6
31195,Amy,24, It should be me.,6,Big Bang Theory,17,4
31196,Raj,24, Why? So you can make jokes about cutting open my brain?,6,Big Bang Theory,56,11
31197,Amy,24," A, that was not a joke, that was a sincere request. And B, more importantly, I was the outsider to this group, and I know how frightening that can be. But you guys took me in and made me feel loved, like I was family.",6,Big Bang Theory,218,45
31198,Sheldon,24," Fine, I'll do it.",6,Big Bang Theory,18,4
31200,Amy,24," So, after I started dating Sheldon, I met Leonard, and then everybody else, and they've all been so wonderful to me.",6,Big Bang Theory,117,21
31202,Amy,24," Maybe next week, we could all get together.",6,Big Bang Theory,44,8
31203,Raj,24," Oh, Lucy, you don't have to answer that. Don't put her on the spot. She hates that. Am I right? Tell her how much you hate being put on the spot. Go ahead, tell her.",6,Big Bang Theory,166,35
31204,Amy,24, Ignore him. He's a little nervous 'cause he doesn't think I understand the severity of your social anxiety.,6,Big Bang Theory,108,18
31205,Raj,24, What the? Are you crazy? You can't talk about social anxiety to someone who has social anxiety. It makes them socially anxious!,6,Big Bang Theory,128,22
31206,Amy,24," Excuse me, but I'm a neurobiologist. I think I'm a little more qualified than you to understand what's not working in your girlfriend's brain!",6,Big Bang Theory,143,24
31207,Raj,24," Don't call her my girlfriend. We haven't discussed whether or not we're girlfriend or boyfriend yet. Now that it's out there, are you my girlfriend? By the way, if you say no, I'll never be happy again. Not to put you on the spot.",6,Big Bang Theory,231,44
31209,Raj,24, We might as well go ahead and eat. She's not coming back anytime soon.,6,Big Bang Theory,71,14
31211,Sheldon,24," This is ridiculous, we're shopping for a party and this store doesn't even have a party section.",6,Big Bang Theory,97,17
31212,Penny,24," Yeah, it does, and here we are.",6,Big Bang Theory,32,7
31213,Sheldon,24," You know, I have to say, Penny, I don't understand why you of all people are encouraging Leonard to do this.",6,Big Bang Theory,109,21
31214,Penny,24," Well, I'm his girlfriend, of course I'm gonna support him.",6,Big Bang Theory,59,10
31215,Sheldon,24," Yeah, well, you're his girlfriend for now. You know, maybe you're not aware of this, but there is a rich tradition of men at sea finding comfort in each other's arms and britches.",6,Big Bang Theory,180,33
31216,Penny,24," Honey, this is a big deal for Leonard, okay? He gets to work with Stephen Hawking. Who, by the way, will not be on the boat. I checked it out.",6,Big Bang Theory,143,30
31217,Sheldon,24," It's not that big of an opportunity. And even if Hawking's theories are correct, all they prove is where the universe came from, why everything exists and what its ultimate end will be. I mean, me? I'm interested in the big questions.",6,Big Bang Theory,235,42
31218,Penny,24," Oh, my God, Sheldon the genius is jealous of Leonard.",6,Big Bang Theory,54,10
31219,Sheldon,24, I'm not jealous. I'm just very unhappy that good things are happening for him and not happening for me.,6,Big Bang Theory,104,19
31220,Penny,24," Look, sweetie, this is a natural thing to feel, okay? But just because good things are happening to Leonard doesn't take anything away from you. You know what? Let me tell you a little story. Once there was a girl who worked at the Cheesecake Factory, and she wasn't very good at her job.",6,Big Bang Theory,289,54
31221,Sheldon,24, It was you.,6,Big Bang Theory,12,3
31222,Penny,24," It wasn't me. But she was also an actress, and we were both up for the same part in a toothpaste commercial. She got it. Look, I was so jealous. But instead of ripping out her fake blonde hair",6,Big Bang Theory,193,39
31223,Sheldon,24, You ripped out your own fake blonde hair.,6,Big Bang Theory,42,8
31224,Penny,24," I, looked her in the eye, smiled and said, I'm happy for you. Because that's what friends do.",6,Big Bang Theory,94,18
31225,Sheldon,24, They lie so they don't look petty.,6,Big Bang Theory,35,7
31226,Penny,24, Yeah.,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
31227,Sheldon,24, How?,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
31228,Penny,24, Like this. I am so happy for you.,6,Big Bang Theory,34,8
31229,Sheldon,24, Wow. No wonder you didn't get that toothpaste commercial.,6,Big Bang Theory,58,9
31231,Raj,24, Hey.,6,Big Bang Theory,5,1
31233,Raj,24," I want to apologize for Amy last night. She was completely out of line. Are you, are you not speaking to me or did the screen freeze again?",6,Big Bang Theory,140,28
31235,Raj,24," Okay. I know. It was me. I, I pushed too hard. I'm sorry.",6,Big Bang Theory,58,13
31237,Raj,24," You know, I, I've been thinking that maybe meeting somebody one-on-one is too intense, so Friday night, my friends are having a party.",6,Big Bang Theory,135,23
31239,Raj,24," A little one. It's, it's a farewell for Leonard, so all the attention will be on him. If you wear something brown and sit on the couch, they won't even know you're there.",6,Big Bang Theory,171,33
31241,Raj,24," Oh, please?",6,Big Bang Theory,12,2
31243,Raj,24," Come on. Don't make me beg. And I'm from India, so I know how to do it.",6,Big Bang Theory,72,17
31245,Raj,24," Yeah, thank you! This means a lot to me. My friends are like my family. Unless you don't like them, in which case, they're dead to me.",6,Big Bang Theory,135,27
31248,Leonard,24, Yeah.,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
31250,Leonard,24, Yeah.,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
31251,Howard,24," I'm proud of you, Leonard. Working out on the North Sea for months, that's really something.",6,Big Bang Theory,93,16
31252,Leonard,24," I know. As far as science goes, this is the adventure of a lifetime.",6,Big Bang Theory,69,14
31253,Howard,24, Maybe your lifetime. I went to space.,6,Big Bang Theory,38,7
31254,Leonard,24, It's not a competition.,6,Big Bang Theory,24,4
31255,Howard,24," You're right, you're right. I'm really proud of you, and I'm gonna miss you when you're gone. And space beats water.",6,Big Bang Theory,117,21
31256,Amy,24," Rajesh, I thought Lucy was coming.",6,Big Bang Theory,35,6
31257,Raj,24," She is. She's just running a little late. You know how it is, girls always fussing about their hair, their makeup. She'll be here. Just give it a rest, okay?",6,Big Bang Theory,158,30
31258,Sheldon,24," Um, can I have your attention, everyone?  That's, uh, B-flat, for those who don't have perfect pitch. I would like to propose a toast to my best friend, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter. He has been presented with a wonderful opportunity, and I couldn't be happier for him.",6,Big Bang Theory,264,46
31259,Leonard,24," Thank you, Sheldon. That must've been very hard for you to say.",6,Big Bang Theory,64,12
31260,Sheldon,24," Well, I mean it. I'm really happy for you. And that's how you get a toothpaste commercial. Cheers.",6,Big Bang Theory,99,18
31261,Howard,24, Cheers.,6,Big Bang Theory,8,1
31262,Penny,24, Cheers.,6,Big Bang Theory,8,1
31263,Howard,24, It was really nice of you to try to be happy for Leonard.,6,Big Bang Theory,58,13
31264,Sheldon,24, Thank you.,6,Big Bang Theory,11,2
31265,Howard,24, It must've killed you when I went to space.,6,Big Bang Theory,44,9
31266,Raj,24," Oh, no.",6,Big Bang Theory,8,2
31267,Howard,24," Buddy, you okay? Oh, man.",6,Big Bang Theory,26,5
31269,Raj,24," Uh, go ahead. Read it.",6,Big Bang Theory,23,5
31270,Howard,24," Raj, I can't come to the party. This is all just too much for me. I don't think we should see each other any more. Sorry. Lucy.",6,Big Bang Theory,128,27
31271,Raj,24, Excuse me.,6,Big Bang Theory,11,2
31272,Penny,24," Raj, I'm so sorry.",6,Big Bang Theory,19,4
31273,Amy,24," Me, too.",6,Big Bang Theory,9,2
31274,Sheldon,24, It did not kill me when you went to space. Monkeys went to space.,6,Big Bang Theory,66,14
31276,Penny,24," Well, here we are.",6,Big Bang Theory,19,4
31277,Leonard,24, Yep. I'm really gonna miss you.,6,Big Bang Theory,32,6
31278,Penny,24," I'm gonna miss you, too.",6,Big Bang Theory,25,5
31279,Sheldon,24," Penny, we're in the red zone. The white zone is for loading and unloading. We're breaking the law.",6,Big Bang Theory,99,18
31280,Penny,24," Okay, there's no space in the white zone, so",6,Big Bang Theory,45,9
31281,Leonard,24," Anyway, we can e-mail, and I think the phone connections are pretty good.",6,Big Bang Theory,74,13
31282,Sheldon,24," All right, you have to get out of the car right now. I'm not going to jail for you.",6,Big Bang Theory,84,19
31283,Leonard,24, Would you just relax?,6,Big Bang Theory,22,4
31284,Sheldon,24," Oh, I see a space in the white zone. Quick, circle the airport.",6,Big Bang Theory,64,13
31285,Penny,24, Did you bring enough inhalers?,6,Big Bang Theory,31,5
31286,Leonard,24, Yeah.,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
31287,Penny,24," And, uh, extra Dramamine? You remember what happened on It's a Small World.",6,Big Bang Theory,76,13
31288,Leonard,24, I'm covered.,6,Big Bang Theory,13,2
31289,Penny,24, Okay.,6,Big Bang Theory,6,1
31290,Sheldon,24," Oh, dear Lord, a police officer's glancing in our direction. We've been made.",6,Big Bang Theory,78,13
31291,Leonard,24, Calm down. I'm getting out. I have something I want to give you.,6,Big Bang Theory,65,13
31292,Penny,24," Oh, Leonard.",6,Big Bang Theory,13,2
31293,Sheldon,24," It's just a heart-shaped locket with a picture of Leonard's face in it. He got it at the mall on clearance. Now move, move, move.",6,Big Bang Theory,130,25
31294,Penny,24, I love you.,6,Big Bang Theory,12,3
31295,Leonard,24," I love you, too.",6,Big Bang Theory,17,4
31296,Sheldon,24," Don't worry, Officer. They just love each other. We're not smuggling drugs.",6,Big Bang Theory,76,12
31298,Penny,24," Raj, it's Penny. Are you in there?",6,Big Bang Theory,35,7
31299,Raj,24, Hang on.,6,Big Bang Theory,9,2
31300,Penny,24, Hey. I'm just coming back from the airport. I wanted to see how you're doing.,6,Big Bang Theory,78,15
31301,Raj,24," That's, that's very nice of you. Uh, come, come. Come on in.",6,Big Bang Theory,61,12
31302,Penny,24," Can't stay long. I left Sheldon in the car with the window cracked open. He's gonna go through that activity book in, like, 30 seconds, so Are you okay?",6,Big Bang Theory,153,29
31303,Raj,24, No.,6,Big Bang Theory,4,1
31304,Penny,24, Oh. I'm so sorry.,6,Big Bang Theory,18,4
31305,Raj,24," No. It's my fault. You know, I finally found someone who was right for me, and I, I drove her away.",6,Big Bang Theory,100,21
31306,Penny,24," Oh, Raj.",6,Big Bang Theory,9,2
31307,Raj,24," Penny, I, I miss her already.",6,Big Bang Theory,30,6
31308,Penny,24," I know how you feel. I miss Leonard, too.",6,Big Bang Theory,42,9
31309,Raj,24," What's like, what is wrong with me? Why, why can't I ever have love?",6,Big Bang Theory,69,14
31310,Penny,24, You will.,6,Big Bang Theory,10,2
31311,Raj,24," No, I, I won't. I'm, I'm unlovable.",6,Big Bang Theory,36,7
31312,Penny,24, That's just the booze talking.,6,Big Bang Theory,31,5
31313,Raj,24," No, it's not. I haven't had a drink since last night.",6,Big Bang Theory,54,11
31314,Penny,24, You're talking to me.,6,Big Bang Theory,22,4
31315,Raj,24, I am. And now I'm crying for a whole different reason!,6,Big Bang Theory,55,11
31316,Penny,24," Oh, me, too.",6,Big Bang Theory,13,3
31318,Raj,24, So I guess what I'm saying is I get where Lucy's coming from.,6,Big Bang Theory,62,13
31319,Penny,24, That's great. Do you want some wine?,6,Big Bang Theory,37,7
31320,Raj,24," Uh, no, water's fine. Anyhow, I've been thinking about it a lot and, and I totally see why Lucy did what she did. I pushed too hard. But you know what? If I back off and give her enough space, maybe there's still a future for us. Yeah, the funny thing about life is that, you know, sometimes",6,Big Bang Theory,292,58
31321,Amy,24, Does he ever shut up?,6,Big Bang Theory,22,5
31322,Raj,24,"  but then it turns good again, and that means it's better than if it had never been bad for a while. I know that now, thing's aren't good, they are in fact very very bad but at least my heart is starting to heal. Slowly but surely. And oh how I cried. It was like a little, uh, thunderstorm on my face. But I'm a man, okay? So I need to pull myself together, pick up a pen and get it all out in my journal. I mean, it's not all bad, right? Having my heart broken has allowed me to finally speak in front of you, so, you know, a silver lining.",6,Big Bang Theory,543,113
31324,Leonard,1," Sheldon, it's not a great time, what do you want?",7,Big Bang Theory,50,10
31325,Sheldon,1," Hello to you, too. I'm sorry, but this is important.",7,Big Bang Theory,53,10
31326,Leonard,1, What is it?,7,Big Bang Theory,12,3
31327,Sheldon,1," Back to the Future II was in the Back to the Future III case, and Back to the Future III was, get this, in the Back to the Future II case.",7,Big Bang Theory,139,31
31328,Leonard,1, So?,7,Big Bang Theory,4,1
31329,Sheldon,1," So, did you do that, or am I in the house with an intruder?",7,Big Bang Theory,60,14
31330,Leonard,1," Sheldon, I got to go inside. It's getting rough out here.",7,Big Bang Theory,58,11
31331,Sheldon,1," You're dodging the question, I knew it was you. What was that?",7,Big Bang Theory,63,12
31332,Leonard,1, What was what?,7,Big Bang Theory,15,3
31333,Sheldon,1," This isn't a very good connection, but it sounded like someone just released a kraken.",7,Big Bang Theory,87,15
31334,Leonard,1," Okay, I'm hanging up now. You know there's no such thing as a k ",7,Big Bang Theory,65,14
31335,Sheldon,1, No!,7,Big Bang Theory,4,1
31337,Sheldon,1,  Penny.  Penny.  Penny. ,7,Big Bang Theory,25,3
31338,Penny,1, What's the matter?,7,Big Bang Theory,19,3
31339,Sheldon,1," Um, well, I was worried that you might be missing Leonard. And that might be causing you to have bad dreams, like the kind you'd get if you watched Clash of the Titans right before you went to bed.",7,Big Bang Theory,198,39
31340,Penny,1," Sweetie, did you have a bad dream?",7,Big Bang Theory,35,7
31341,Sheldon,1," To be honest, I did.",7,Big Bang Theory,21,5
31342,Penny,1, Aw.,7,Big Bang Theory,4,1
31343,Sheldon,1, Back to the Future II was in the Back to the Future III case. Leonard did it.,7,Big Bang Theory,78,17
31344,Penny,1, Good night.,7,Big Bang Theory,12,2
31345,Sheldon,1," No, wait. Perhaps I should sleep here so you don't miss Leonard as much, uh, 'cause you're being kind of a baby about it.",7,Big Bang Theory,122,24
31346,Penny,1, You know what? That would make me feel better. Thank you.,7,Big Bang Theory,58,11
31347,Sheldon,1, You're welcome. Good night.,7,Big Bang Theory,28,4
31349,Raj,1," I think you'd be pleased to hear that this morning in the parking garage I saw this oil stain on the ground that was shaped just like my ex-girlfriend, Lucy, and I didn't get upset at all.",7,Big Bang Theory,189,37
31350,Howard,1, I'm proud of you.,7,Big Bang Theory,18,4
31351,Raj,1," Well, you should be, 'cause she was looking good.",7,Big Bang Theory,50,9
31352,Sheldon,1," Dear Lord, you're an astronomer. Although you may have earthly woes, get your mind back on the stars. Gee, even the lowly dung beetle chooses to plot its course by using the Milky Way.",7,Big Bang Theory,185,34
31353,Raj,1, Is that true?,7,Big Bang Theory,14,3
31354,Sheldon,1," Everything I say is true. Now, of course, the dung beetle also enjoys eating faeces, living in faeces and making little balls out of faeces, so, you know, pick and choose which aspects of its lifestyle you want to embrace.",7,Big Bang Theory,223,40
31355,Howard,1," Come on, you can talk to girls now. It shouldn't be hard for you to meet someone new.",7,Big Bang Theory,86,18
31356,Raj,1," How can I meet someone new when everywhere I look, I see Lucy's face? Tell me you don't see her smile in the crust of this chicken pot pie.",7,Big Bang Theory,140,29
31357,Howard,1," Oh, will you stop it. Now, listen to me, there's a welcome party for incoming post-docs tonight. Go to it and meet someone who isn't made of grease or pie.",7,Big Bang Theory,156,30
31358,Raj,1, You think you're so cool because your wife is a person?,7,Big Bang Theory,56,11
31359,Howard,1," Look, Bernie's at a neuroscience conference with Amy, I'll go with you.",7,Big Bang Theory,72,12
31360,Raj,1, You would do that for me?,7,Big Bang Theory,26,6
31361,Howard,1, Of course. You're my friend. I want you to be happy.,7,Big Bang Theory,53,11
31362,Raj,1," Thanks. Oh, Sheldon, since Amy's out of town, would you like to join us?",7,Big Bang Theory,73,14
31363,Sheldon,1," I want you to be happy, too, but not enough to do anything about it.",7,Big Bang Theory,69,15
31366,Amy,1," Sheldon, stop. For the last time, I will not bring home bed bugs. ",7,Big Bang Theory,67,13
31368,Amy,1," Because I looked in the bed, and there are no bugs.",7,Big Bang Theory,52,11
31370,Amy,1," Good night. No, I will not consider sleeping in my garment bag.",7,Big Bang Theory,64,12
31372,Sheldon,1," Penny, did you ever wonder how Starfleet captains",7,Big Bang Theory,50,8
31373,Penny,1, No.,7,Big Bang Theory,4,1
31374,Sheldon,1," Well, now that I've piqued your interest, welcome to the exciting world of 3D chess.",7,Big Bang Theory,85,15
31375,Penny,1, Why don't you just admit you only want to play this game because you always play it with Leonard and you miss him?,7,Big Bang Theory,115,23
31376,Sheldon,1, You overestimate his significance in my life.,7,Big Bang Theory,46,7
31377,Penny,1, Mmm.,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
31378,Sheldon,1, Do I miss how he makes a face on my toaster waffle with syrup? No. Do I miss the way he fixes the zipper on my jacket when it gets stuck? I don't think so. Do I miss how we say good night to each other through the walls of our bedroom using Morse code? ,7,Big Bang Theory,254,55
31379,Penny,1," Okay, I get it, I get it. You are an emotionless robot.",7,Big Bang Theory,56,12
31380,Sheldon,1," Well, I try.",7,Big Bang Theory,13,3
31381,Penny,1," All right, let's just get this stupid game over with.",7,Big Bang Theory,54,10
31382,Sheldon,1, Great. I'll go first.,7,Big Bang Theory,22,4
31383,Penny,1, Okay.,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
31384,Sheldon,1," By the way, how are you with zippers?",7,Big Bang Theory,38,8
31385,Penny,1, Why?,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
31386,Sheldon,1," Well, I really need to go to the bathroom, and this one's gone all cattywampus.",7,Big Bang Theory,80,15
31388,Raj,1," Wow, your work on jellyfish neural nets sounds so interesting. ",7,Big Bang Theory,64,10
31390,Raj,1, I will. You can download my paper on the Van Allen Belts from the university server as well.,7,Big Bang Theory,93,18
31392,Raj,1, All right.,7,Big Bang Theory,11,2
31393,Howard,1, How'd it go?,7,Big Bang Theory,13,3
31394,Raj,1," Well, if you like dry, factual statements interspersed with painful moments of silence, it was bananas.",7,Big Bang Theory,104,16
31395,Howard,1, Check it out. Mrs. Davis from Human Resources is here. She's probably on the lookout for sexual harassment.,7,Big Bang Theory,108,18
31396,Raj,1," Oh, great. There go my chances of being sexually harassed.",7,Big Bang Theory,59,10
31397,Howard,1," I heard her husband left her for a hot, young undergrad.",7,Big Bang Theory,57,11
31398,Raj,1," That's so much better than the old, ugly ones.",7,Big Bang Theory,47,9
31400,Howard,1," Mrs. Davis, nice to see you. ",7,Big Bang Theory,30,6
31401,Raj,1," You know, I recently read a fascinating article on infidelity among penguins.",7,Big Bang Theory,78,12
31403,Raj,1," So if the fact that your husband left you makes you feel unattractive, just remember, penguins get cheated on, and they're adorable.",7,Big Bang Theory,133,22
31404,Howard,1, It was better when you couldn't talk to women.,7,Big Bang Theory,47,9
31407,Amy,1," Oh, brain lesions are fascinating. Unless they're yours, then they're a drag.",7,Big Bang Theory,78,12
31409,Amy,1, And to the sick and dying who make it possible.,7,Big Bang Theory,48,10
31411,Amy,1," Which is fine, but it's nice to mix it up with a little intellectual conversation.",7,Big Bang Theory,83,15
31413,Amy,1," Oh, my gosh, boys bought us drinks, boys bought us drinks. Thank you, thank you, thank you so much.",7,Big Bang Theory,100,19
31415,Amy,1," You be cool. Guys are hitting on us, and not just to get to Penny.",7,Big Bang Theory,67,15
31418,Sheldon,1, Ooh. Bad move.,7,Big Bang Theory,15,3
31419,Penny,1, Really? Why?,7,Big Bang Theory,13,2
31420,Sheldon,1, My queen can now take your rook from below.,7,Big Bang Theory,44,9
31421,Penny,1," So that means I lose, right? It's over?",7,Big Bang Theory,40,8
31422,Sheldon,1," If I make this move, but I won't because we're having too much fun.",7,Big Bang Theory,68,14
31423,Penny,1," Okay, let's take a break. ",7,Big Bang Theory,27,5
31424,Sheldon,1, We're all out of alcohol.,7,Big Bang Theory,26,5
31425,Penny,1," I wasn't going to get alcohol. Gosh, I wonder what Leonard's doing right now. I miss him so much.",7,Big Bang Theory,98,19
31426,Sheldon,1," Well, if you'd like, we could call him. I mean that you could call him. As I've explained, the absence of my friends does not cause me pain. As rock and roll bad boy Paul Simon once said, I am a rock, I am an i-i-i-island.",7,Big Bang Theory,223,46
31427,Penny,1, I'm calling him.,7,Big Bang Theory,17,3
31428,Sheldon,1," Oh, goodie, put him on speaker phone.",7,Big Bang Theory,38,7
31429,Leonard,1," Excuse me, ladies, my pants are buzzing. North Sea, how can I kelp you?",7,Big Bang Theory,72,14
31430,Penny,1, Leonard?,7,Big Bang Theory,9,1
31431,Leonard,1," Penny? Hey, it's Penny. Everybody say hi to Penny.",7,Big Bang Theory,51,9
31433,Penny,1," Wow, it sounds like you're having a good time.",7,Big Bang Theory,47,9
31434,Leonard,1, Best time of my life. ,7,Big Bang Theory,23,5
31435,Sheldon,1, Isn't it five thirty in the morning there?,7,Big Bang Theory,43,8
31436,Leonard,1," Is it? Hey, everybody, it's five thirty in the morning!",7,Big Bang Theory,56,10
31437,Penny,1," Uh, okay, well, we were just calling you because we were missing you.",7,Big Bang Theory,70,13
31439,Leonard,1," Uh-oh, hang on.",7,Big Bang Theory,16,3
31440,Sheldon,1, Are you in danger?,7,Big Bang Theory,19,4
31441,Leonard,1," No, it's a drinking game. Whenever we see an iceberg, we take a shot!",7,Big Bang Theory,70,14
31443,Penny,1," Leonard, Leonard? I cannot believe we were missing that jerk.",7,Big Bang Theory,62,10
31444,Sheldon,1, You were.,7,Big Bang Theory,10,2
31446,Amy,1, So what happened? How'd it go?,7,Big Bang Theory,31,6
31448,Amy,1, So I can drink this without having to give up the goodies?,7,Big Bang Theory,59,12
31450,Amy,1, And why would no one blame me?,7,Big Bang Theory,31,7
31452,Amy,1," Well, it sounds like you're saying that I could do better than Sheldon.",7,Big Bang Theory,72,13
31454,Amy,1," No, tell me, I want to know what you meant by that.",7,Big Bang Theory,52,12
31456,Amy,1, And your husband is extremely Howard. What's your point?,7,Big Bang Theory,57,9
31458,Amy,1," We could, but unfortunately my brain is lesion-free and I remember that rotten thing you just said about my sweet baboo.",7,Big Bang Theory,121,21
31460,Amy,1, Sure.,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
31462,Amy,1, Your husband's weird and his clothes are ridiculous.,7,Big Bang Theory,53,8
31464,Penny,1, I can't believe it. All this time I've been doing nothing but sit around and miss that guy. And you know what the worst part is?,7,Big Bang Theory,129,26
31465,Sheldon,1, That you're having to process your emotional pain without vodka?,7,Big Bang Theory,65,10
31466,Penny,1, No. Yeah. But you know what the second-worst part is? He does not miss me at all.,7,Big Bang Theory,82,17
31467,Sheldon,1, Allow me to comfort you. At least you've got your health.,7,Big Bang Theory,58,11
31468,Penny,1," Really? That, that's it? That's comforting?",7,Big Bang Theory,44,6
31469,Sheldon,1," Um, uh, in a hundred years, you'll both be dead and it won't matter?",7,Big Bang Theory,69,14
31470,Penny,1," No. Come on, you're supposed to say, of course he misses you, the only reason he's partying is to cover up his pain.",7,Big Bang Theory,117,23
31471,Sheldon,1," Oh, no, I don't think that's true at all.",7,Big Bang Theory,42,9
31472,Penny,1, This is ridiculous. Why am I upset just because he's off having a good time?,7,Big Bang Theory,77,15
31473,Sheldon,1," Well, perhaps you're obsessively picturing him engaged in drunken coitus with another woman. Is that it? Did I get it right?",7,Big Bang Theory,125,21
31474,Penny,1," Okay, that, that's great. You can stop trying to make me feel better now.",7,Big Bang Theory,74,14
31475,Sheldon,1," Actually, I can't. Before Leonard left, he made me promise that I'd take care of you.",7,Big Bang Theory,86,16
31476,Penny,1, He did?,7,Big Bang Theory,8,2
31477,Sheldon,1, Yes.,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
31478,Penny,1," Oh, that's really sweet.",7,Big Bang Theory,25,4
31479,Sheldon,1," Plus, if I do a good job, he said he'd bring me back a sailor's cap.",7,Big Bang Theory,69,16
31480,Penny,1," Well, now I miss him even more.",7,Big Bang Theory,32,7
31481,Sheldon,1," Well, if it's any consolation, I'm sure Leonard's tormented every moment he's away from your warm embrace and cherry lips.",7,Big Bang Theory,123,20
31482,Penny,1, Thanks.,7,Big Bang Theory,8,1
31483,Sheldon,1," Oh, seriously?",7,Big Bang Theory,15,2
31485,Raj,1," Uh, excuse me, Mrs. Davis?",7,Big Bang Theory,27,5
31487,Raj,1," I'd like to apologize for being insensitive. And for possibly making penguins seem like jerks, because 99% of them are stand-up guys.",7,Big Bang Theory,134,22
31489,Raj,1," You know, you, you and I, you and I have a lot in common.",7,Big Bang Theory,58,14
31491,Raj,1," Oh, yes, I, I too am in the throes of heartbreak. Okay, fine, I'll tell you about it.",7,Big Bang Theory,86,18
31493,Sheldon,1, Here is a hot beverage to comfort you. It's in a to-go cup. Make of that what you will.,7,Big Bang Theory,88,19
31494,Penny,1, Come on. It's still early. Let's do something.,7,Big Bang Theory,47,8
31495,Sheldon,1," Well, I have been toying around with an idea for 4D chess.",7,Big Bang Theory,59,12
31496,Penny,1, How about we just talk?,7,Big Bang Theory,24,5
31497,Sheldon,1, All right. In 4D chess,7,Big Bang Theory,23,5
31498,Penny,1," No. Come on, let's talk about our lives. Tell me something about you I don't know.",7,Big Bang Theory,83,16
31499,Sheldon,1, I own nine pairs of pants.,7,Big Bang Theory,27,6
31500,Penny,1," Okay, that, that's a good start, but I was thinking maybe something a little more personal.",7,Big Bang Theory,92,16
31501,Sheldon,1, I see. I own nine pairs of underpants.,7,Big Bang Theory,39,8
31502,Penny,1, How about I go first?,7,Big Bang Theory,22,5
31503,Sheldon,1," But I don't want to know how many underpants you own. Although, based on the floor of your bedroom, I'd say it's a thousand.",7,Big Bang Theory,125,24
31504,Penny,1," Okay, look, here's something people do not know about me. When I first moved out to L.A., I did a topless scene in a low-budget horror movie about a killer gorilla. Ugh! After I did it, I felt so ashamed. Thankfully, that thing never came out.",7,Big Bang Theory,244,46
31505,Sheldon,1, I've seen that. Yeah. Serial Apeist. Howard found it online the day we met you.,7,Big Bang Theory,80,15
31506,Penny,1," Oh, God.",7,Big Bang Theory,9,2
31507,Sheldon,1," And it was literally the moment you walked out the door. But I see the type of personal revelations you're going for. Okay, here's one I thought I'd take to the grave.",7,Big Bang Theory,168,32
31508,Penny,1, Okay.,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
31509,Sheldon,1," Hmm. A while back, YouTube changed its user interface from a star-based rating system to a thumbs-up rating system. I tell people I'm okay with it, but I'm really not.",7,Big Bang Theory,168,30
31510,Penny,1, That's your big revelation?,7,Big Bang Theory,28,4
31511,Sheldon,1," Yes. Whew, I feel ten pounds lighter.",7,Big Bang Theory,38,7
31512,Penny,1," Okay, you know what? I give up. I'm going to bed.",7,Big Bang Theory,50,11
31513,Sheldon,1, Here's something else you don't know about me. You just hurt my feelings.,7,Big Bang Theory,74,13
31514,Penny,1, What did I do?,7,Big Bang Theory,15,4
31515,Sheldon,1," I opened up and shared something deeply upsetting to me, and you treated it as if it were nothing.",7,Big Bang Theory,99,19
31516,Penny,1," I, I didn't think it was a big deal.",7,Big Bang Theory,37,9
31517,Sheldon,1, It is to me; that's the point.,7,Big Bang Theory,31,7
31518,Penny,1," Sheldon, you are right. I'm really sorry. I should've known better.",7,Big Bang Theory,68,11
31519,Sheldon,1, Your apology is accepted.,7,Big Bang Theory,26,4
31520,Penny,1, Thank you. How about a hug?,7,Big Bang Theory,28,6
31521,Sheldon,1, How about a hearty handshake?,7,Big Bang Theory,30,5
31522,Penny,1, Come on.,7,Big Bang Theory,9,2
31523,Sheldon,1, Now I know how you felt getting mauled by that sex-crazed gorilla.,7,Big Bang Theory,67,12
31526,Amy,1, Mm-hmm. It was rather flattering to have strangers send us drinks.,7,Big Bang Theory,67,11
31528,Amy,1, Maybe tomorrow morning we put on some hot pants and see if we can score us some free omelettes.,7,Big Bang Theory,96,19
31530,Amy,1, I think I would have gone with the short one with the goofy haircut.,7,Big Bang Theory,69,14
31532,Amy,1," Not my guy. I caught him staring at my rack. It'd be nice to be with a man who wants to know what's underneath my cardigan. FYI, it's another cardigan.",7,Big Bang Theory,152,30
31534,Amy,1, Your brainy virgin kind of sounds like Sheldon.,7,Big Bang Theory,48,8
31538,Raj,1," Yeah, I can relate to being a single parent. I have a dog.",7,Big Bang Theory,59,13
31540,Raj,1," Mrs. Davis, I, uh, I must confess, I came here tonight in a futile attempt to pick up some lonely postdoc, but instead I got to connect with you at a human level. That's a much better evening. You're a lovely person.",7,Big Bang Theory,217,42
31542,Raj,1," No, no, no, that would be crazy. I mean, if I were hitting on you, you'd know it 'cause you'd feel uncomfortable and a little sad for me.",7,Big Bang Theory,138,28
31544,Raj,1, Good night.,7,Big Bang Theory,12,2
31545,Howard,1, Looks like she accepted your apology.,7,Big Bang Theory,38,6
31546,Raj,1, And then some. I think we had a moment.,7,Big Bang Theory,40,9
31547,Howard,1," Oh, please, you did not have a moment.",7,Big Bang Theory,39,8
31548,Raj,1, Who died and made you king of moments?,7,Big Bang Theory,39,8
31549,Howard,1," Okay, fine. Let's say there was a moment.",7,Big Bang Theory,42,8
31550,Raj,1, There was.,7,Big Bang Theory,11,2
31551,Howard,1," There wasn't. But, but even if there was, what are you gonna do about it?",7,Big Bang Theory,74,15
31552,Raj,1," I will slowly seduce her until she falls helpless into my bed, hungry for the pleasure only I can give her.",7,Big Bang Theory,108,21
31553,Howard,1, So nothing.,7,Big Bang Theory,12,2
31554,Raj,1," No, not a thing.",7,Big Bang Theory,17,4
31556,Penny,1," Ah, I'm so glad the police finally caught that psychotic genetically engineered ape.",7,Big Bang Theory,85,13
31557,Leonard,1, That is my girlfriend. I swear to God.,7,Big Bang Theory,39,8
31559,Penny,1, Aaaaaaah!,7,Big Bang Theory,10,1
31561,Sheldon,2, And here's another interesting weather fact.,7,Big Bang Theory,45,6
31562,Penny,2, Another? Great.,7,Big Bang Theory,16,2
31563,Sheldon,2," Changes in jet streams can affect the speed at which the Earth rotates on its axis, so bad weather can actually make the day longer.",7,Big Bang Theory,133,25
31564,Penny,2," Well, there must be a hell of a storm somewhere.",7,Big Bang Theory,49,10
31565,Sheldon,2," Joke if you must, but you're going to miss these moments. With Leonard home in a few days, this was your last time driving me to the grocery store.",7,Big Bang Theory,148,29
31566,Penny,2," You know, I will miss this.",7,Big Bang Theory,28,6
31567,Sheldon,2," I'll tell you what, if my apples are mealy, we'll hit the produce section for one last crazy blowout. Heck, you can even push the cart. Please don't take my looking forward to Leonard's return as criticism of the job you've been doing in his absence.",7,Big Bang Theory,251,46
31568,Penny,2, I won't.,7,Big Bang Theory,9,2
31569,Sheldon,2, That criticism will come later in your report card.,7,Big Bang Theory,52,9
31570,Penny,2," Yeah, I didn't stay for the detention, I'm not gonna read the report card.",7,Big Bang Theory,75,14
31571,Leonard,2, Hello.,7,Big Bang Theory,7,1
31572,Penny,2, Leonard! Hi!,7,Big Bang Theory,13,2
31573,Leonard,2, Keep your voice down.,7,Big Bang Theory,22,4
31574,Penny,2," Oh, my God. You weren't supposed to be here till Sunday.",7,Big Bang Theory,57,11
31575,Leonard,2," We finished the experiment early, so I thought I'd come home and surprise you.",7,Big Bang Theory,79,14
31576,Penny,2," Oh, my gosh, why are we whispering?",7,Big Bang Theory,36,7
31577,Leonard,2," I didn't tell Sheldon, so we could have a few days alone.",7,Big Bang Theory,58,12
31578,Penny,2," Oh, that is so romantic.",7,Big Bang Theory,25,5
31579,Leonard,2," Uh, sure, that's why I did it.",7,Big Bang Theory,31,7
31580,Penny,2," Oh, I just cannot believe you're here.",7,Big Bang Theory,39,7
31581,Sheldon,2," Penny, it's your lucky day. Three of the eggs are clearly not jumbo. Grab your keys.",7,Big Bang Theory,85,16
31583,Sheldon,2," Uh, Stuart, I was wondering if you could help me find something.",7,Big Bang Theory,65,12
31585,Sheldon,2," Oh, you make me laugh, sad clown. Anyhoo, Leonard will be back in a couple days and I need a welcome home gift for him. As he's been at sea, perhaps something with a nautical theme might be appropriate.",7,Big Bang Theory,203,39
31587,Sheldon,2," Aquaman? Oh, this isn't a gag gift, Stuart.",7,Big Bang Theory,44,8
31589,Sheldon,2, I'm a real collector. How rare is it?,7,Big Bang Theory,38,8
31591,Sheldon,2, Don't try and trick me into buying something I don't want. Now let's talk Aquaman. ,7,Big Bang Theory,84,15
31592,Howard,2," What were they thinking, putting Doctor Octopus's mind in Spider-Man's body?",7,Big Bang Theory,77,11
31593,Raj,2," Well, I've been quite enjoying that. It combines all the superhero fun of Spider-Man with all the body-switching shenanigans of Freaky Friday. Both versions, original and Lohan.",7,Big Bang Theory,178,27
31594,Raj,2," Hey, what's your problem?",7,Big Bang Theory,26,4
31595,Howard,2," I'm sorry, I've been kind of snippy lately. It's probably this stupid diet I'm on.",7,Big Bang Theory,83,15
31596,Raj,2, Why are you on a diet?,7,Big Bang Theory,23,6
31597,Howard,2, I've put on a couple pounds. Had to buy these pants in the men's section.,7,Big Bang Theory,74,15
31598,Raj,2," Well, we've all seen your mom. That Butterball turkey was bound to come home to roost.",7,Big Bang Theory,87,16
31599,Sheldon,2, Twelve hundred dollars. That's my final offer.,7,Big Bang Theory,47,7
31601,Sheldon,2," Oh, right, a present for Leonard. You better throw in that squirt gun.",7,Big Bang Theory,71,13
31603,Sheldon,2, Oh.,7,Big Bang Theory,4,1
31605,Leonard,2, And this is me doing the Titanic pose on the boat.,7,Big Bang Theory,51,11
31606,Penny,2, Ah.,7,Big Bang Theory,4,1
31607,Leonard,2," And, oh, that's me getting rescued after I fell in.",7,Big Bang Theory,52,10
31608,Penny,2," Oh.  Oh, that's the pizza.",7,Big Bang Theory,27,5
31609,Leonard,2, Yep. Here's some money.,7,Big Bang Theory,24,4
31610,Penny,2, Thank you.,7,Big Bang Theory,11,2
31611,Leonard,2, And I'm gonna hit the head. That's what us salty sea dogs say when we have to go pee-pee.,7,Big Bang Theory,90,19
31612,Penny,2, Hey.,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
31614,Penny,2," Okay, here's, uh, twenty-five. Keep the change.",7,Big Bang Theory,48,7
31616,Penny,2," Oh. Okay. Well, here's, um, thirty something cents and a promise I won't call your boss and tell him you reek of marijuana.",7,Big Bang Theory,124,23
31617,Sheldon,2," Oh, Penny, I see you've ordered pizza. I have Chinese food. ",7,Big Bang Theory,61,11
31618,Penny,2, That's nice.,7,Big Bang Theory,13,2
31619,Sheldon,2," Oh, that's a rather earthy cologne. My uncle used to wear that. Perhaps we can enjoy one last meal together before Leonard returns.",7,Big Bang Theory,132,23
31620,Penny,2," Yeah, thanks, but I kind of feel like eating alone tonight, so",7,Big Bang Theory,63,12
31621,Sheldon,2," Are you sure? With your Italian pizza and my Chinese noodles, we could play Marco Polo. I mean, of course, a re-enactment of a meal in the life of Marco Polo the Venetian explorer, not Marco Polo the terrifying water sport.",7,Big Bang Theory,224,41
31622,Penny,2," Uh, yeah, it sounds fun, but no thanks.  Have a good night!",7,Big Bang Theory,60,12
31623,Sheldon,2," What, now, do you have company?",7,Big Bang Theory,32,6
31624,Penny,2," No. No, no, no. You know what? The toilet's been doing that. I called the building manager, so",7,Big Bang Theory,95,18
31625,Sheldon,2," Oh, I can take a look at it.",7,Big Bang Theory,29,8
31626,Penny,2, Well,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
31627,Sheldon,2," I'm quite familiar with plumbing. Not to brag, but I spent most of fifth grade with my head in a toilet.",7,Big Bang Theory,105,21
31628,Penny,2," Yeah, no, no, no. You know what, Sheldon, it's okay. You don't have to go into the bathroom.",7,Big Bang Theory,93,18
31629,Sheldon,2," That's curious. If there's no one here, why are there two glasses of wine on the table?",7,Big Bang Theory,88,17
31630,Penny,2," Oh. Well, you know, I, I've got two hands and a bit of a drinking problem.",7,Big Bang Theory,75,16
31631,Sheldon,2, Of course. Ask a silly question. ,7,Big Bang Theory,34,6
31632,Penny,2, Oh. ,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
31633,Sheldon,2, That's odd.,7,Big Bang Theory,12,2
31634,Penny,2," Um, what?",7,Big Bang Theory,10,2
31635,Sheldon,2, There are takeout containers in the trash can.,7,Big Bang Theory,47,8
31636,Penny,2, So? That's my dinner from last night.,7,Big Bang Theory,38,7
31637,Sheldon,2, What's odd is they're in the trash can.,7,Big Bang Theory,40,8
31638,Penny,2," Okay. Look, honey, I promise there's no one's here. Iâ€˜ve had a long day. I just want to have a quiet dinner by myself.",7,Big Bang Theory,121,24
31639,Sheldon,2," Oh, very well. I'm no stranger to enjoying the pleasures of solitude. Oh!",7,Big Bang Theory,74,13
31640,Penny,2, What?,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
31641,Sheldon,2, Have you gotten Leonard a welcome-home gift yet?,7,Big Bang Theory,49,8
31642,Penny,2, No.,7,Big Bang Theory,4,1
31643,Sheldon,2," Oh, great. Do you want to go halfsies on a two hundred dollar squirt gun?",7,Big Bang Theory,74,15
31646,Howard,2, Hey.,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
31648,Howard,2," You're kidding, right? I mean, you know I'm trying to lose weight. God, I thought we were partners in this marriage.",7,Big Bang Theory,117,21
31650,Howard,2," Really? Tell that to the bathroom scale, 'cause one of you is lying.",7,Big Bang Theory,69,13
31652,Howard,2, Awful. I had to rub her ointment all over her again.,7,Big Bang Theory,53,11
31654,Howard,2," â€˜Cause we've got a deeply unhealthy relationship. Which reminds me, do you think you can get any samples of this from work? This was supposed to last her a month, but they didn't take into account the square footage of her back.",7,Big Bang Theory,231,42
31656,Howard,2, I don't know. Few weeks. Why?,7,Big Bang Theory,30,6
31658,Howard,2, Like these swollen sausages could fit in gloves.,7,Big Bang Theory,49,8
31660,Howard,2, You're full of oestrogen and you don't act like that.,7,Big Bang Theory,54,10
31662,Howard,2, Fine. I'll wear gloves next time.,7,Big Bang Theory,34,6
31664,Howard,2, I feel so stupid. And fat.,7,Big Bang Theory,27,6
31666,Howard,2," Sex? Really? I mean, that's just your solution to everything. ",7,Big Bang Theory,63,10
31668,Amy,2," Oh, and here's a fun thing. I worked it out so that there are two different words for spoon, planko and janko. Planko is a spoon with food, janko is a spoon without food. Janko is spelled with a silent ptang. Sheldon, you're not even listening to the rules of my made-up language.",7,Big Bang Theory,281,53
31669,Sheldon,2," Yes, I am.",7,Big Bang Theory,11,3
31670,Amy,2, Then what does tweepadock mean?,7,Big Bang Theory,32,5
31671,Sheldon,2," Uh, elephant?",7,Big Bang Theory,14,2
31672,Amy,2, Lucky guess.,7,Big Bang Theory,13,2
31673,Sheldon,2, I'm sorry. I'm just distracted by something that happened over at Penny's.,7,Big Bang Theory,75,12
31674,Amy,2, What happened?,7,Big Bang Theory,15,2
31675,Sheldon,2, I fear Penny is being unfaithful to Leonard.,7,Big Bang Theory,45,8
31676,Amy,2, What?,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
31677,Sheldon,2," She claimed to be alone when there was obviously someone else in her apartment. I have no choice but to assume the worst, given Leonard's lengthy sea voyage and her famously ravenous nether regions.",7,Big Bang Theory,199,34
31678,Amy,2, I don't think Penny would cheat on Leonard.,7,Big Bang Theory,44,8
31679,Sheldon,2," Oh, really? She and I once had a staring contest. She clapped really loud and made me blink. It's a small leap from there to sexual infidelity.",7,Big Bang Theory,144,27
31680,Amy,2, You're being ridiculous.,7,Big Bang Theory,25,3
31681,Sheldon,2," Amy, there were Chinese food containers in the trash can.",7,Big Bang Theory,58,10
31682,Amy,2, Poor Leonard.,7,Big Bang Theory,14,2
31684,Amy,2, Do you hear anything?,7,Big Bang Theory,22,4
31685,Sheldon,2, I hear a woman's voice.,7,Big Bang Theory,24,5
31686,Amy,2, Is it Penny?,7,Big Bang Theory,13,3
31687,Sheldon,2," No, it's you. All right, I hear whispering and giggling. Now I think I hear kissing.",7,Big Bang Theory,85,16
31688,Amy,2," Yeah, like you know what kissing sounds like.",7,Big Bang Theory,46,8
31689,Sheldon,2," There's kissing in Star Trek, smarty-pants.",7,Big Bang Theory,44,6
31690,Amy,2, Let me listen. Sounds like Leonard.,7,Big Bang Theory,36,6
31691,Sheldon,2," Please. Why would Leonard come home early and waste his time kissing Penny when he could be hanging out with his best buddy? Yeah, that's it. I'm catching her in the act. ",7,Big Bang Theory,172,32
31692,Amy,2," No, Sheldon, don't.",7,Big Bang Theory,20,3
31693,Sheldon,2, Aha. ,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
31694,Penny,2, What the hell?,7,Big Bang Theory,15,3
31695,Sheldon,2, Leonard?,7,Big Bang Theory,9,1
31696,Penny,2," Sheldon, you cannot just barge in here like that. ",7,Big Bang Theory,51,9
31697,Sheldon,2, Right.   Penny.  Penny.  Penny. Are you going to answer the door or should I open it and say aha again?,7,Big Bang Theory,104,20
31699,Leonard,2," I'm sorry, Sheldon. I should've told you I was back. I just wanted to have a couple days alone with Penny.",7,Big Bang Theory,107,21
31700,Sheldon,2," Oh, no, I should apologize. Uh, I never realized to what extent our friendship was a burden to you.",7,Big Bang Theory,100,19
31701,Leonard,2, That is not fair. I complain about what a burden it is at least once a month.,7,Big Bang Theory,78,17
31702,Sheldon,2," Oh, no, no, let's not sugarcoat this. You find me finicky, pedantic and annoying.",7,Big Bang Theory,82,14
31703,Penny,2," No, he doesn't.",7,Big Bang Theory,16,3
31704,Leonard,2, I actually have used those exact words before. In that order.,7,Big Bang Theory,62,11
31705,Sheldon,2," Well, Leonard, I think it's high time you and I address the tweepadock in the room.",7,Big Bang Theory,84,16
31706,Leonard,2, The what?,7,Big Bang Theory,10,2
31707,Sheldon,2, Amy?,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
31708,Amy,2, Please leave me out of this.,7,Big Bang Theory,29,6
31709,Sheldon,2," Fine. Leonard, there's no need for you to pretend to like me anymore.",7,Big Bang Theory,70,13
31710,Leonard,2," Come on, I said I was sorry.",7,Big Bang Theory,29,7
31711,Sheldon,2," No, no, you save your apologies for after you've had disappointing coitus with Penny.",7,Big Bang Theory,86,14
31712,Penny,2, It was fine.,7,Big Bang Theory,13,3
31713,Leonard,2," Come on, this is silly. Hey, um, I brought you back a little present from my trip, huh? It's that sailor cap that you wanted. It's neat, huh?",7,Big Bang Theory,142,28
31714,Sheldon,2, You honestly think you can buy back my friendship with a cheap souvenir?,7,Big Bang Theory,73,13
31715,Leonard,2," I don't. I really don't. Just try it on. Oh, yeah.",7,Big Bang Theory,51,11
31716,Amy,2," Hello, sailor.",7,Big Bang Theory,15,2
31717,Penny,2," Ooh, now we're talking.",7,Big Bang Theory,24,4
31718,Sheldon,2," Excuse me. This changes nothing. Except the Halloween costume I'm wearing this year. Amy, you're going to be Olive Oyl. Lay off the doughnuts.",7,Big Bang Theory,143,24
31720,Howard,2, Thanks for coming over.,7,Big Bang Theory,24,4
31721,Raj,2," No problem. Ooh, you made little sandwiches.",7,Big Bang Theory,45,7
31722,Howard,2," Yeah, that's cucumber and cream cheese. That's turkey and loganberry. And don't tell my hips, but I'm warming up a brie in the oven.",7,Big Bang Theory,133,24
31723,Raj,2," Nice. So, mmm. What's up?",7,Big Bang Theory,26,5
31724,Howard,2," Okay, well, I've been reading up on all the side effects you can get from oestrogen, and, I need you to be honest with me. Do my boobs look bigger to you?",7,Big Bang Theory,155,32
31725,Raj,2," Well, it's kind of hard to tell. ",7,Big Bang Theory,34,7
31726,Howard,2," Come on, Raj, it's a yes or no question.",7,Big Bang Theory,41,9
31727,Raj,2," I'm not sure. Um, wait. Jump up and down, let's see if they jiggle. Uh, no, I, I still can't tell, uh, oh, you know what? Okay, uh, give me some of this.",7,Big Bang Theory,154,33
31728,Howard,2, Seriously?,7,Big Bang Theory,11,1
31729,Raj,2, Do you want my help or not?,7,Big Bang Theory,28,7
31730,Howard,2, Fine.,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
31731,Raj,2," Okay, yup. See, see, that, that looks like, that looks like they could be bigger. But you know, I bet, I bet when I do it, mine do the same thing.",7,Big Bang Theory,147,31
31732,Howard,2," Yeah, they kind of do.",7,Big Bang Theory,23,5
31733,Raj,2," Hmm. Uh, let me see something. ",7,Big Bang Theory,32,6
31734,Howard,2," Hey, easy, my nipples are sensitive.",7,Big Bang Theory,37,6
31735,Raj,2," Oh. Sorry, sorry, uh, okay.  I mean, yeah, maybe.",7,Big Bang Theory,50,9
31736,Howard,2," Okay, let me feel. No, I am definitely up a cup size. ",7,Big Bang Theory,55,12
31737,Raj,2," You know, but, but they're very firm, so you've got that going for you.",7,Big Bang Theory,72,14
31738,Howard,2, You think?,7,Big Bang Theory,11,2
31739,Raj,2," Yeah, yeah, yeah, very perky.",7,Big Bang Theory,30,5
31740,Howard,2," Thank you. I really needed to hear that today.  Ooh, brie's ready.",7,Big Bang Theory,67,12
31741,Raj,2, Yay.,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
31743,Leonard,2, Good morning.,7,Big Bang Theory,14,2
31744,Sheldon,2, Hello.,7,Big Bang Theory,7,1
31745,Leonard,2, So am I driving you to work or are you still mad at me?,7,Big Bang Theory,56,14
31746,Sheldon,2, I'd like a ride. Assuming you actually do take me to work.,7,Big Bang Theory,59,12
31747,Leonard,2, Where do you think I would take you?,7,Big Bang Theory,37,8
31748,Sheldon,2," Who knows? Uh, you said you'd be home yesterday, but you came home three days ago. You say you're taking me to work, but for all I know, I'll end up in a deserted amusement park. Or a cornfield maze. Or a back alley dog fight. You tell me.",7,Big Bang Theory,240,49
31749,Leonard,2, I'm going to work. You can come if you want.,7,Big Bang Theory,45,10
31750,Sheldon,2," Okay. By the way, you have something on your shirt.",7,Big Bang Theory,52,10
31751,Leonard,2," No, I don't.",7,Big Bang Theory,13,3
31752,Sheldon,2," Hurts, doesn't it? You know, I find myself wondering if anything you've ever told me is true.",7,Big Bang Theory,94,17
31753,Leonard,2," I didn't make it back. The ship sank, I'm in hell.",7,Big Bang Theory,51,11
31754,Sheldon,2," You say you're from New Jersey, but how can I believe you?",7,Big Bang Theory,59,12
31755,Leonard,2, Why would anyone claim to be from New Jersey if they weren't?,7,Big Bang Theory,62,12
31756,Sheldon,2," All right, I'll give you that one.",7,Big Bang Theory,35,7
31757,Leonard,2," Hey, I said I was sorry. What else do you want from me?",7,Big Bang Theory,56,13
31758,Sheldon,2, I want you to admit that what you did was wrong.,7,Big Bang Theory,49,11
31759,Leonard,2, Fine. What I did was wrong.,7,Big Bang Theory,28,6
31760,Sheldon,2, I wish I could believe you.,7,Big Bang Theory,28,6
31761,Leonard,2," You know what? I'm not driving you to work, because you're incredibly annoying.",7,Big Bang Theory,80,13
31762,Sheldon,2," You say one thing and do the other, so then you are driving me and you find me a delight.",7,Big Bang Theory,90,20
31763,Leonard,2, Stop it.,7,Big Bang Theory,9,2
31764,Sheldon,2, Keep it up?,7,Big Bang Theory,12,3
31765,Leonard,2, Bye.,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
31766,Sheldon,2, Hello. So I guess you're really holding up the other four fingers?,7,Big Bang Theory,67,12
31768,Penny,2," Oh, hey, what are you doing here so early?",7,Big Bang Theory,43,9
31769,Amy,2, Driving Sheldon to work.,7,Big Bang Theory,25,4
31770,Penny,2," He's still mad at Leonard, huh?",7,Big Bang Theory,32,6
31771,Amy,2," Well, he's mad at you, too. He says you're the succubus who led his friend astray.",7,Big Bang Theory,83,16
31772,Penny,2," I don't know what succubus is, but it has suck in it, so that can't be good.",7,Big Bang Theory,77,17
31773,Sheldon,2, Thought I heard you out here.,7,Big Bang Theory,30,6
31774,Penny,2," Hey, Sheldon.",7,Big Bang Theory,14,2
31775,Sheldon,2, You don't get a hey. You get a hmm.,7,Big Bang Theory,36,9
31776,Penny,2," Come on, don't be like that. We had so much fun together the last couple of months.",7,Big Bang Theory,84,17
31777,Sheldon,2, You're right. Which makes your betrayal all the more devastating.,7,Big Bang Theory,66,10
31778,Penny,2, Sheldon.,7,Big Bang Theory,9,1
31779,Sheldon,2, I let you buy feminine hygiene products with my supermarket club card. You have any idea the kind of coupons I'm going to get in the mail now?,7,Big Bang Theory,143,28
31780,Amy,2," Sheldon, your fight's with Leonard. Penny's got nothing to do",7,Big Bang Theory,62,10
31781,Sheldon,2," Careful, Amy. The friend of my enemy's girlfriend is my enemy. ",7,Big Bang Theory,64,11
31782,Amy,2, Really?,7,Big Bang Theory,8,1
31783,Sheldon,2, Yes. You're either with me or against me.,7,Big Bang Theory,42,8
31784,Amy,2, You want to take the bus to work?,7,Big Bang Theory,34,8
31785,Sheldon,2, Maybe there's a third option.,7,Big Bang Theory,30,5
31786,Amy,2," FYI, I had a doughnut for breakfast, you jerk.",7,Big Bang Theory,47,9
31788,Leonard,2," So now we're just waiting for the data from the ship to be crunched, but the numbers look pretty promising.",7,Big Bang Theory,108,20
31789,Howard,2," That's so great. If you guys prove the existence of Unruh radiation Hey, hey, hey, hey. My eyes are up here.",7,Big Bang Theory,109,21
31790,Sheldon,2," Howard, Raj. Judas.",7,Big Bang Theory,20,3
31791,Leonard,2, You know what? You're a crazy person.,7,Big Bang Theory,38,7
31792,Sheldon,2," A crazy person with a long memory, and if all goes according to plan, a robot army.",7,Big Bang Theory,84,17
31793,Howard,2, Stop it.,7,Big Bang Theory,9,2
31794,Sheldon,2, Or a mutant army. It depends on how my Kickstarter goes.,7,Big Bang Theory,57,11
31795,Howard,2," I said, stop it. Now, listen to me. You two aren't just friends. You're best friends. And that's a beautiful thing. I mean, Leonard, you know why he's so mad at you? It's 'cause he missed you. Yeah, and as his friend, you should be happy he has love in his life. As I do. This man held my breast the other day and I love him for it.",7,Big Bang Theory,333,69
31796,Raj,2," A little loud, dude.",7,Big Bang Theory,21,4
31797,Howard,2," So, can we please put aside these petty differences and just be glad we're here together?",7,Big Bang Theory,90,16
31798,Leonard,2, Okay.,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
31799,Sheldon,2, I suppose so.,7,Big Bang Theory,14,3
31800,Howard,2, Thank you.,7,Big Bang Theory,11,2
31801,Raj,2," Uh, it wasn't anything weird. It was just to see how big they were.",7,Big Bang Theory,68,14
31803,Sheldon,2," And then Leonard took me to the barber and the dentist, and then to cap off the perfect day, the Los Angeles Bureau of Weights and Measures. ",7,Big Bang Theory,142,27
31804,Leonard,2," I thought the measures were going to be the stars of the show, turns out it was the weights.",7,Big Bang Theory,93,19
31805,Penny,2, I'm so glad you guys are friends again.,7,Big Bang Theory,40,8
31806,Sheldon,2," And I'm glad you and I are friends again, too.",7,Big Bang Theory,47,10
31807,Penny,2, Aw.,7,Big Bang Theory,4,1
31808,Sheldon,2," Which reminds me. This came in the mail, and I want you to have it.",7,Big Bang Theory,68,15
31809,Penny,2, Fifty cents off Vagisil.,7,Big Bang Theory,25,4
31810,Sheldon,2, Think of me when you apply it.,7,Big Bang Theory,31,7
31811,Raj,2," Uh, can I just say, I've missed all of us hanging out together.",7,Big Bang Theory,64,13
31812,Sheldon,2, Yeah.,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
31813,Penny,2," Me, too.",7,Big Bang Theory,9,2
31814,Leonard,2," Um, since when can Koothrappali talk in front of the girls without a beer?",7,Big Bang Theory,75,14
31816,Leonard,2, And no one told me?,7,Big Bang Theory,20,5
31817,Howard,2, Can't believe we forgot to tell him.,7,Big Bang Theory,37,7
31818,Penny,2, Think of Sheldon when you apply it.,7,Big Bang Theory,36,7
31820,Raj,3," So, couldn't help but notice none of you RSVP'd to my murder mystery dinner party.",7,Big Bang Theory,83,15
31821,Leonard,3," Oh, yeah. We were meaning to do that.",7,Big Bang Theory,38,8
31822,Raj,3," No, you weren't because it was a week ago and nobody came. So, if you want to solve the mystery of who stabbed Koothrappali in the back with the weapon of indifference, it was all of you.",7,Big Bang Theory,188,37
31823,Sheldon,3," I don't think thatqualifies as a mystery, we all knew what we were doing.",7,Big Bang Theory,74,14
31824,Amy,3," We're sorry, Rajesh. ",7,Big Bang Theory,22,3
31826,Howard,3," Whoa, whoa, we're not that sorry.",7,Big Bang Theory,34,6
31827,Raj,3," Don't worry, I can take a hint. No more murder mystery parties.",7,Big Bang Theory,64,12
31828,Leonard,3, Great. ,7,Big Bang Theory,8,1
31829,Sheldon,3, Thank you.,7,Big Bang Theory,11,2
31830,Howard,3, Hallelujah.,7,Big Bang Theory,12,1
31831,Raj,3, Because I've got something even better planned.,7,Big Bang Theory,48,7
31832,Leonard,3, Aw.,7,Big Bang Theory,4,1
31833,Howard,3, Why?,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
31834,Sheldon,3, Come on.,7,Big Bang Theory,9,2
31835,Raj,3, Just hear me out. I'm going to make you guys a scavenger hunt like they have at M.I.T.,7,Big Bang Theory,87,18
31836,Howard,3," Oh, I loved those. I did them every year there.",7,Big Bang Theory,48,10
31837,Leonard,3," We did them at Princeton, too.",7,Big Bang Theory,31,6
31838,Howard,3," Oh, that's cute. Like it's a real college.",7,Big Bang Theory,43,8
31839,Sheldon,3," That's amusing, I was going to say that about M.I.T., but it works for Princeton, too.",7,Big Bang Theory,87,16
31840,Amy,3," Scavenger hunts at Harvard were really tough. I always got stuck on the first challenge, trying to find someone to be on a team with me. I guess that story's more sad than funny.",7,Big Bang Theory,179,34
31841,Penny,3, I love scavenger hunts. My friends and I had them all the time.,7,Big Bang Theory,64,13
31842,Leonard,3," Oh, these are a little different. There's a tradition at elite universities",7,Big Bang Theory,76,12
31843,Howard,3, And Princeton.,7,Big Bang Theory,15,2
31844,Leonard,3," A tradition of hunts full of puzzles that rely on logic and obscure knowledge, science.",7,Big Bang Theory,88,15
31845,Penny,3," Oh, in ours we would just run around town looking for a store that would sell us beer.",7,Big Bang Theory,87,18
31846,Raj,3," So, uh, who's in?",7,Big Bang Theory,18,4
31847,Leonard,3, I think it sounds fun.,7,Big Bang Theory,23,5
31848,Amy,3," Yeah, me, too.",7,Big Bang Theory,15,3
31850,Sheldon,3, I'm sorry. Are we really doing this or are we tricking Koothrappali again like with the dinner party?,7,Big Bang Theory,102,18
31852,Leonard,3, What's all this?,7,Big Bang Theory,17,3
31853,Sheldon,3," Oh, everything I could possibly need to win the scavenger hunt.",7,Big Bang Theory,64,11
31854,Leonard,3, You really think he's gonna send us to a bowling alley?,7,Big Bang Theory,56,11
31855,Sheldon,3," Well, if he does, do you know how filthy those rental balls are? They might as well stand on the corner and give away free rectal exams.",7,Big Bang Theory,137,27
31856,Raj,3," Okay, everybody. Who's ready for a scavenger hunt?  Somewhere in the city of Pasadena, I've hidden a golden coin. You will be faced with a total of ten puzzles. Each p  each, each puzzle will lead you to the location of the next, the last of which will lead you to the coin. The first team that finds it wins.",7,Big Bang Theory,310,60
31857,Sheldon,3, He is a born showman.,7,Big Bang Theory,22,5
31858,Raj,3, Any questions?,7,Big Bang Theory,15,2
31859,Howard,3," Yes, to be fair, do people who went to Princeton get a head start?",7,Big Bang Theory,67,14
31860,Leonard,3, It's not funny.,7,Big Bang Theory,16,3
31861,Sheldon,3," No, Oh, it actually is if you get the joke. It's based on the premise that Princeton isn't a very good school. ",7,Big Bang Theory,112,22
31862,Leonard,3, Ha-ha.,7,Big Bang Theory,7,1
31863,Sheldon,3," Oh, see? Now he gets it.",7,Big Bang Theory,25,6
31864,Raj,3," Okay, guys, go ahead and divide yourselves into teams of two.",7,Big Bang Theory,62,11
31866,Leonard,3, Couples sounds great. Or we could mix things up. Maybe pick names out of a hat. Whatever.,7,Big Bang Theory,90,17
31867,Penny,3," Whoa, whoa, whoa. Why don't you just admit you don't want to be on a team with me.",7,Big Bang Theory,83,18
31868,Leonard,3," I just said, couples sound great.",7,Big Bang Theory,34,6
31869,Penny,3," Mm-hmm, yeah, you don't think I'm smart enough. You think I'm gonna be a liability. Even though I totally just used the word liability correctly in a sentence. Yeah.",7,Big Bang Theory,166,29
31870,Leonard,3," All right, let's, let's do couples. I want to.",7,Big Bang Theory,47,9
31871,Penny,3," No, no. Let's mix things up. I choose Sheldon, and we're gonna kick your ass!",7,Big Bang Theory,78,15
31872,Sheldon,3, Really? The only time I'm ever picked first for a team and I'm stuck with the liability?,7,Big Bang Theory,89,17
31873,Amy,3, Stop that. Penny is not a liability.,7,Big Bang Theory,37,7
31874,Penny,3, Thank you. Do you want to be on my team?,7,Big Bang Theory,41,10
31875,Amy,3, Maybe we pick names out of a hat.,7,Big Bang Theory,34,8
31877,Penny,3," All right, hurry up and close the door so they can't hear us. Would you stop pouting? So, you picked my name. Get over it.",7,Big Bang Theory,123,25
31878,Sheldon,3," Yes, and do you know what the odds are I'd pick your name?",7,Big Bang Theory,59,13
31879,Penny,3, No.,7,Big Bang Theory,4,1
31880,Sheldon,3," It's not hard, one in five. Now you know why I'm pouting.",7,Big Bang Theory,58,12
31881,Raj,3," All right, teams. Get ready to open your first puzzle. Go. Do you see what I did? The first puzzle is a puzzle. Oh, my God, how adorable is that? I wish I had a friend like me.",7,Big Bang Theory,177,38
31882,Sheldon,3, What are you doing? You have to start with the edges.,7,Big Bang Theory,54,11
31883,Penny,3," Well, there's no right way, Sheldon. I already found a few pieces that fit.",7,Big Bang Theory,76,14
31884,Sheldon,3," Yeah, well, take them apart and start with the edges. And stop wasting time.",7,Big Bang Theory,77,14
31885,Howard,3," Wow, you're really good at puzzles.",7,Big Bang Theory,36,6
31886,Amy,3," I did them all the time as a kid. As my mom used to say, when you're doing a puzzle, it's like having a thousand friends. She was full of fun lies like that.",7,Big Bang Theory,158,34
31887,Howard,3," If it makes you feel any better, my mom's just full of pound cake.",7,Big Bang Theory,67,14
31888,Amy,3, I'm sorry you got stuck with me. I bet you wanted to be with Bernadette.,7,Big Bang Theory,73,15
31889,Howard,3, Have you ever played a game with Bernadette?,7,Big Bang Theory,45,8
31890,Amy,3, No.,7,Big Bang Theory,4,1
31891,Howard,3, Have you ever gone into a steel cage with a wolverine?,7,Big Bang Theory,55,11
31893,Leonard,3, Stop yelling at me.,7,Big Bang Theory,20,4
31895,Penny,3," Ooh, ooh, it's the comic book store. All right, come on, that's where we have to go.",7,Big Bang Theory,85,17
31896,Sheldon,3, But we haven't finished the puzzle.,7,Big Bang Theory,36,6
31897,Penny,3," But, it, it doesn't matter. We know the answer, come on.",7,Big Bang Theory,57,11
31898,Sheldon,3," You think you know the answer. But it could be a trick. What if when the puzzle's complete, there's a sign in the window that says go to the train store?",7,Big Bang Theory,154,31
31899,Penny,3," Okay, it's not gonna say that.",7,Big Bang Theory,31,6
31900,Sheldon,3," Well, I hope you're wrong. I really want to go to the train store.",7,Big Bang Theory,67,14
31901,Howard,3, It's the comic book store. Let's go.,7,Big Bang Theory,37,7
31903,Penny,3," It's the comic book store, it's the comic book store, it's the comic book store.",7,Big Bang Theory,81,15
31904,Sheldon,3, It's the comic book store.,7,Big Bang Theory,27,5
31906,Leonard,3, Do you think Penny's mad at me?,7,Big Bang Theory,32,7
31908,Leonard,3," No, because I didn't want her on my team.",7,Big Bang Theory,42,9
31910,Leonard,3," Geez, I never realized you were so competitive.",7,Big Bang Theory,48,8
31913,Amy,3, I think this is the first time we've ever actually been alone together.,7,Big Bang Theory,72,13
31914,Howard,3," Huh, I guess you're right. Wonder why that is?",7,Big Bang Theory,47,9
31915,Amy,3," Well, off the top of my head, I'd say we don't have a lot in common except for the people we're involved with. Plus, when we first met, Penny warned me never to get into a car alone with you.",7,Big Bang Theory,192,40
31916,Howard,3," Yeah. You know, I bet you and I have more in common than we think.",7,Big Bang Theory,67,15
31917,Amy,3, Such as?,7,Big Bang Theory,9,2
31918,Howard,3, I don't know. Tell me some things you like.,7,Big Bang Theory,44,9
31919,Amy,3," Uh, let's see. I like harps, Little House on the Prairie, medieval poetry, medieval literature",7,Big Bang Theory,95,15
31920,Howard,3," Hey, how about some music?",7,Big Bang Theory,27,5
31921,Amy,3, Great. Sheldon never lets me listen to music in the car. He doesn't want to be mistaken for a gang member. ,7,Big Bang Theory,108,21
31922,Howard,3, Find something you like.,7,Big Bang Theory,25,4
31923,Amy,3," Beatles, boring. Eminem, scary. Weird Al? How old are you? Neil Diamond?",7,Big Bang Theory,73,12
31924,Howard,3," Yeah, I love Neil Diamond.",7,Big Bang Theory,27,5
31925,Amy,3, I love Neil Diamond.,7,Big Bang Theory,21,4
31928,Raj,3," Oh, hey, thanks for letting me use the comic book store as part of the scavenger hunt.",7,Big Bang Theory,87,17
31930,Raj,3," Oh, congratulations. You're the first team to arrive.",7,Big Bang Theory,54,8
31931,Amy,3," Yes, it's not a ruse to make fun of me. It's a real game and I'm winning it.",7,Big Bang Theory,77,18
31932,Raj,3, Your next puzzle is a riddle. And who better to give it to you than The Riddler?,7,Big Bang Theory,81,17
31934,Leonard,3, I have asthma. Back off.,7,Big Bang Theory,25,5
31935,Howard,3," Riddle me this. Arrah, Arrah, and gather round, the work of this hero is legion-bound. He multiplies N by the number of He, and in this room the thing you'll see.",7,Big Bang Theory,163,31
31936,Raj,3," Good riddle, huh?",7,Big Bang Theory,18,3
31938,Raj,3, I invited you to my murder mystery party.,7,Big Bang Theory,42,8
31940,Raj,3, Oh.,7,Big Bang Theory,4,1
31941,Penny,3," Ugh, we're the last ones here, hurry up.",7,Big Bang Theory,41,8
31942,Sheldon,3," It is a marathon, not a sprint.",7,Big Bang Theory,32,7
31943,Penny,3, People run in a marathon.,7,Big Bang Theory,26,5
31944,Sheldon,3, Not with a bowling ball on their back.,7,Big Bang Theory,39,8
31945,Leonard,3," Hey, Penny, I just wanted to say good luck, and I hope there's no hard feelings.",7,Big Bang Theory,81,16
31947,Leonard,3," Relax, it's a hard puzzle. It's gonna take a while to solve.",7,Big Bang Theory,61,12
31948,Penny,3, Riddle me this,7,Big Bang Theory,15,3
31949,Sheldon,3, Got it.,7,Big Bang Theory,8,2
31950,Penny,3," Hey, Princeton, look at that, Team Community College Night School is in the lead.",7,Big Bang Theory,82,14
31951,Sheldon,3, I thought we were the Lightning Sharks.,7,Big Bang Theory,40,7
31952,Howard,3," Hey, you know what this could mean .",7,Big Bang Theory,37,8
31953,Amy,3," Oh, oh, that's good. Then this would be ",7,Big Bang Theory,41,8
31954,Howard,3, That's it. ,7,Big Bang Theory,12,2
31955,Amy,3, To the Neil Mobile.,7,Big Bang Theory,20,4
31957,Leonard,3," Wait, I got it. I got it/",7,Big Bang Theory,26,7
31959,Leonard,3," You're really mean, you know that?",7,Big Bang Theory,35,6
31962,Penny,3," Aha. Okay, let's see. To continue on your quest, leave no stone unturned. Ooh.",7,Big Bang Theory,79,14
31963,Sheldon,3, The next clue must be hidden under one of these rocks.,7,Big Bang Theory,55,11
31964,Penny,3," Oh. Okay. Sheldon, I, I've got to ask, how did you figure out that it was the geology lab?",7,Big Bang Theory,91,19
31965,Sheldon,3," Oh, simple, the â€˜arrah, â€˜arrah in the riddle mean Jan Arrah, a member of the Legion of Superheroes, known as Element Lad. And then the word He, it wasn't the masculine pronoun, but rather H e, the abbreviation for helium. See where I'm going with this?",7,Big Bang Theory,257,46
31966,Penny,3, Yes.,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
31967,Sheldon,3," Nice try. Now, Element Lad's ability is the power to transmute chemical elements. Helium has an atomic number of two. If you multiply that by the atomic number of N, nitrogen, you get 14, which is the atomic number of? I'm just funnin' you, silicon. And that is the most common element in the Earth's surface. So that narrowed it down to the geology lab or the chemistry lab.",7,Big Bang Theory,376,69
31968,Penny,3, Wow. I can drink a beer underwater.,7,Big Bang Theory,36,7
31969,Sheldon,3," And I'm sure your parents are proud. Now, finally, the line in this room the thing you'll see was an obvious reference to Fantastic Four member The Thing, who's made entirely of",7,Big Bang Theory,178,32
31970,Penny,3, Shut up. I solved it.,7,Big Bang Theory,22,5
31971,Sheldon,3, Those are map coordinates. Got 'em. Let's go.,7,Big Bang Theory,46,8
31972,Penny,3," Well, wait. Don't you want to know how I figured it out?",7,Big Bang Theory,57,12
31973,Sheldon,3," No one likes a know-it-all, Penny.",7,Big Bang Theory,35,6
31975,Howard,3, On the boats and on the planes. ,7,Big Bang Theory,33,7
31976,Amy,3, They're coming to America. ,7,Big Bang Theory,28,4
31977,Howard,3, Never looking back again. ,7,Big Bang Theory,27,4
31978,Amy,3, They're coming to America â™ª,7,Big Bang Theory,30,5
31980,Leonard,3," Um, I'm okay with you driving my car. I'm not okay with you flying my car.",7,Big Bang Theory,75,16
31982,Leonard,3, Uh-huh. Like death?,7,Big Bang Theory,20,3
31984,Leonard,3, Penny's not answering my texts.,7,Big Bang Theory,32,5
31986,Leonard,3, This stupid game is why she's mad in the first place. I'm telling her I'm quitting.,7,Big Bang Theory,84,16
31988,Leonard,3, Why?,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
31990,Leonard,3, What does she think I am?,7,Big Bang Theory,26,6
31992,Leonard,3, I can't believe she would say that about me.,7,Big Bang Theory,45,9
31995,Howard,3," They're coming to America, They're coming to America.",7,Big Bang Theory,54,8
31996,Amy,3, Today!,7,Big Bang Theory,7,1
31997,Howard,3, Today!,7,Big Bang Theory,7,1
32000,Sheldon,3," Okay, another 30 feet.",7,Big Bang Theory,23,4
32001,Penny,3," Okay. Oh, it's a bowling alley.",7,Big Bang Theory,32,6
32002,Sheldon,3, Yes. Yes. My brain is better than everybody's.,7,Big Bang Theory,47,8
32004,Howard,3, Love on the rocks. ,7,Big Bang Theory,20,4
32005,Amy,3, Ain't no big surprise.,7,Big Bang Theory,23,4
32006,Howard,3, Just pour me a drink.,7,Big Bang Theory,22,5
32007,Amy,3, And I'll tell you some lies. ,7,Big Bang Theory,30,6
32009,Leonard,3, Call me a lady part. We'll see about that.,7,Big Bang Theory,43,9
32011,Leonard,3, Almost.,7,Big Bang Theory,8,1
32013,Leonard,3, Got it.,7,Big Bang Theory,8,2
32015,Leonard,3," Yeah, Penny might be onto something.",7,Big Bang Theory,37,6
32017,Sheldon,3, To the planetarium.,7,Big Bang Theory,20,3
32018,Penny,3, Let's go.,7,Big Bang Theory,10,2
32020,Leonard,3, To the tar pits.,7,Big Bang Theory,17,4
32023,Amy,3, There's a Neil Diamond concert next month.,7,Big Bang Theory,43,7
32024,Howard,3, Let's go.,7,Big Bang Theory,10,2
32026,Penny,3," Three bags, no one's opened 'em. we're the first ones here.",7,Big Bang Theory,60,11
32027,Sheldon,3, It's dirty laundry. You're up.,7,Big Bang Theory,31,5
32028,Penny,3, What? Why me?,7,Big Bang Theory,14,3
32029,Sheldon,3, Because you've been training for this your whole life. You live in a pile of dirty laundry.,7,Big Bang Theory,92,17
32031,Penny,3," Okay, the clue must be in the bag.",7,Big Bang Theory,35,8
32032,Leonard,3, The clue must be in the bag.,7,Big Bang Theory,29,7
32033,Penny,3, It's just a bunch of pants.,7,Big Bang Theory,28,6
32034,Leonard,3, It's just a bunch of pants.,7,Big Bang Theory,28,6
32035,Penny,3," You know, I'm surprised you want to copy my answers since I'm not even smart enough to be on your team. ",7,Big Bang Theory,105,21
32036,Leonard,3," Well, why would you want to be on someone's team who you like to call a, I can't even say it in front of Sheldon.",7,Big Bang Theory,114,25
32037,Penny,3, What are you talking about?,7,Big Bang Theory,28,5
32038,Leonard,3, You know exactly what I'm talking about.,7,Big Bang Theory,41,7
32040,Leonard,3, Why would you do that?,7,Big Bang Theory,23,5
32042,Sheldon,3, I'm not a child. I know the word ninny.,7,Big Bang Theory,40,9
32043,Penny,3," Yeah, well, you should have quit 'cause I'm still gonna beat your ass.",7,Big Bang Theory,71,13
32045,Leonard,3," Hey, I am every bit as much of a man as Penny. Now, let's do this.",7,Big Bang Theory,67,16
32046,Sheldon,3," Wait, it's not all pants, there's one shirt.",7,Big Bang Theory,45,8
32047,Penny,3, Oh.,7,Big Bang Theory,4,1
32048,Sheldon,3," Hey, that's my shirt.",7,Big Bang Theory,22,4
32049,Leonard,3," This one is, too.",7,Big Bang Theory,18,4
32050,Sheldon,3," No, no, that's not mine. It has a big spot on it.",7,Big Bang Theory,50,12
32051,Penny,3, But wait. So does this one.,7,Big Bang Theory,28,6
32053,Penny,3, Sheldon's spot. The coin is in your spot.,7,Big Bang Theory,42,8
32054,Sheldon,3," Oh, that's clever.",7,Big Bang Theory,19,3
32055,Penny,3, Hurry.,7,Big Bang Theory,7,1
32056,Sheldon,3, Be there in a minute. I just have to pre-soak these.,7,Big Bang Theory,53,11
32059,Penny,3," Well, where the hell's the coin?",7,Big Bang Theory,33,6
32060,Leonard,3, Wasn't the answer Sheldon's spot?,7,Big Bang Theory,34,5
32061,Raj,3," Oh, yes, Leonard. Yes, it was.",7,Big Bang Theory,31,6
32063,Raj,3," Yes, exactly. Where is the coin? Why don't you look in your pockets? I slipped them in there earlier today.",7,Big Bang Theory,108,20
32064,Penny,3, I don't get it.,7,Big Bang Theory,16,4
32065,Raj,3," Don't you see? When we're all having fun together, we're already winners. Oh, look. See? Even I'm a winner.",7,Big Bang Theory,108,19
32066,Leonard,3, Are you kidding me?,7,Big Bang Theory,20,4
32067,Penny,3, That is the stupidest thing I've ever heard. ,7,Big Bang Theory,46,8
32069,Raj,3," Well, I thought Come on, I didn't want anyone to feel bad at the end of the game. And some of those puzzles were really hard and I didn't know who was gonna get Penny.",7,Big Bang Theory,168,35
32070,Penny,3, Run.,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
32071,Raj,3," Okay, okay, that-that came out wrong, but you have to admit, you all had a wonderful time.",7,Big Bang Theory,91,17
32072,Penny,3, Run to India.,7,Big Bang Theory,14,3
32073,Raj,3, I just wanted to do something beautiful.,7,Big Bang Theory,41,7
32074,Sheldon,3," Hey, look. I won.",7,Big Bang Theory,18,4
32076,Howard,3," Hey, she got the way to move me, Cherry,",7,Big Bang Theory,41,9
32077,Amy,3, She got the way to groove me.,7,Big Bang Theory,30,7
32078,Howard,3," Cherry, baby",7,Big Bang Theory,13,2
32079,Amy,3," She got the way to move me, honey.",7,Big Bang Theory,35,8
32081,Howard,3, Cherry,7,Big Bang Theory,7,1
32084,Sheldon,4, So what'd you think?,7,Big Bang Theory,21,4
32085,Amy,4, It was good.,7,Big Bang Theory,13,3
32086,Sheldon,4, That's it? Goodâ€ù,7,Big Bang Theory,19,3
32087,Amy,4," I enjoyed it. When you told me I was going to be losing my virginity, I didn't think you meant showing me Raiders of the Lost Ark for the first time.",7,Big Bang Theory,150,31
32088,Sheldon,4," My apologies. I chose my words poorly. I should have said you were about to have your world rocked on my couch. Anyway, thank you for watching it. It's one of my all-time favourites.",7,Big Bang Theory,183,34
32089,Amy,4, It was very entertaining despite the glaring story problem.,7,Big Bang Theory,60,9
32090,Sheldon,4," Story problem? You, oh, Amy, what a dewy-eyed moon-calf you are. Raiders of the Lost Ark is the love child of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, two of the most gifted filmmakers of our generation. I've watched it 36 times, except for the snake scene and the face-melting scene, which I can only watch when it's still light out, but, I defy you to find a story problem. Here's my jaw, drop it.",7,Big Bang Theory,394,73
32091,Amy,4," All right. Indiana Jones plays no role in the outcome of the story. If he weren't in the film, it would turn out exactly the same.",7,Big Bang Theory,131,26
32092,Sheldon,4," Oh, I see your confusion. You don't understand. Indiana Jones was the one in the hat with the whip.",7,Big Bang Theory,100,19
32093,Amy,4," No, I do, and if he weren't in the movie, the Nazis would have still found the ark, taken it to the island, opened it up and all died, just like they did. Let me close that for ya.",7,Big Bang Theory,181,39
32095,Leonard,4, Hey.,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
32096,Penny,4, Hi. I thought you went to the comic book store on Wednesdays.,7,Big Bang Theory,62,12
32097,Leonard,4," Yeah, but Sheldon and Amy were having date night and they don't need me there to make it awkward. They have each other for that. So, how was school?",7,Big Bang Theory,149,29
32098,Penny,4," Oh, good. Check it out, The Disappointing Child by Beverly Hofstadter.",7,Big Bang Theory,71,11
32099,Leonard,4, You bought my mom's book?,7,Big Bang Theory,26,5
32100,Penny,4, Yeah. It's on the recommended reading list for my psychology class.,7,Big Bang Theory,68,11
32101,Leonard,4," Oh, come on. Not that book. It, it's got, like, every horrible story from my childhood in it.",7,Big Bang Theory,94,18
32102,Penny,4," Oh, cool. Are there pictures?",7,Big Bang Theory,30,5
32103,Leonard,4," Seriously, please find another book.",7,Big Bang Theory,37,5
32104,Penny,4," Oh, come on. Why? How bad could it be?",7,Big Bang Theory,39,9
32105,Leonard,4," There, there's chapters about potty training, and bed-wetting and masturbation. Basically, if something came out of me, she wrote about it. You know what? Do whatever you want, just don't talk to me about it.",7,Big Bang Theory,209,35
32106,Penny,4, Not even the chapter on the breast-feeding crisis?,7,Big Bang Theory,51,8
32107,Leonard,4," It was not a crisis. Apparently, I favoured the left one, she got a little lopsided.",7,Big Bang Theory,85,16
32108,Penny,4," Oh, my God, you still go left.",7,Big Bang Theory,31,7
32110,Raj,4, Which celebrity would you say I look like the most?,7,Big Bang Theory,52,10
32111,Howard,4, Halle Berry. Why?,7,Big Bang Theory,18,3
32112,Raj,4," Stuart and I are putting dating profiles online, and it's one of the questions. And thank you, I'd kill for that woman's bone structure.",7,Big Bang Theory,137,24
32113,Leonard,4, Why are you reading Pride and Prejudice?,7,Big Bang Theory,41,7
32114,Sheldon,4," I'll tell you why. Amy ruined Raiders of the Lost Ark for me, so now I'm trying to find something beloved to her and ruin that.",7,Big Bang Theory,128,26
32115,Howard,4, Because her life wasn't enough?,7,Big Bang Theory,32,5
32116,Raj,4," Wait, how can, how can anyone ruin Raiders? It's perfect.",7,Big Bang Theory,58,10
32117,Sheldon,4," Yeah, except for the fact that Indiana Jones is completely irrelevant to the story. With or without him, the Nazis find the ark, open it and die.",7,Big Bang Theory,146,27
32119,Howard,4," Hey, wait a minute. No, the Nazis were digging in the wrong place. The only reason they got the ark was because Indy found it first.",7,Big Bang Theory,133,26
32120,Leonard,4," Actually, they were only digging in the wrong place because Indy had the medallion. Without him, they would have had the medallion and dug in the right place.",7,Big Bang Theory,159,28
32123,Penny,4," Okay, I know you don't want to talk about it, but can I just ask you one question about your mom's book?",7,Big Bang Theory,105,22
32124,Leonard,4, No.,7,Big Bang Theory,4,1
32125,Penny,4, I just want to know why a five-year-old boy puts on his mom's make-up and wears balloon boobies.,7,Big Bang Theory,97,18
32126,Leonard,4," They weren't boobies, they were muscles. And the make-up was green. I was pretending to be The Hulk.",7,Big Bang Theory,101,18
32127,Penny,4, You were wearing her bra.,7,Big Bang Theory,26,5
32128,Leonard,4, That was to keep my muscles from sagging. Can we please stop talking about this?,7,Big Bang Theory,81,15
32129,Penny,4," Okay, okay. But you know, as a student of psychology who got a check-plus on her first homework assignment, I think, sometimes, it's good to open up about these things.",7,Big Bang Theory,169,30
32130,Leonard,4," Okay, fine. Do you want to know why I dressed like The Hulk? Because I was always mad at my mom and I wanted to smash my way out of that house.",7,Big Bang Theory,144,32
32131,Penny,4," Well, why were you so angry?",7,Big Bang Theory,29,6
32132,Leonard,4," Gee, I don't know. Maybe it's because I was always the subject of her little experiments. Did you get to the chapter where she staged the Easter egg hunt with no eggs to see how long I'd keep looking? The answer, by the way, June.",7,Big Bang Theory,231,45
32133,Penny,4," Sweetie, I'm so sorry. I wish there was something I could do to make you feel better.",7,Big Bang Theory,86,17
32134,Leonard,4," I do, too, but there's not.",7,Big Bang Theory,28,6
32135,Penny,4, Really? Are you sure about that?,7,Big Bang Theory,33,6
32136,Leonard,4," Of course, who am I to argue with a check-plus student? Just warning you, I'm gonna go right. Don't make a big deal out of it.",7,Big Bang Theory,127,26
32139,Raj,4," Well, when someone looks at your dating profile, the first thing they see is your picture. I just want to make sure you look fun and full of life and not like a body they just pulled out of the river. All right, here we go, and smile. Okay, uh-uh, that one's in the bank. How about this? Turn away, and then turn back into it. But when you do, imagine the camera is the girl you want to meet.",7,Big Bang Theory,393,80
32141,Raj,4," Okay, uh, let's try it again. Uh, but this time, pretend the girl you want to meet doesn't want to hurt you.",7,Big Bang Theory,109,22
32143,Raj,4," Come on. One more time. Yeah, it's, it's a little blurry, but I think that works in your favour. Do you want a beer?",7,Big Bang Theory,117,24
32145,Raj,4," Almost. Oh, what did you put as the one-word description of yourself?",7,Big Bang Theory,70,12
32147,Raj,4," My parents' money. Uh, what did you put for your best feature?",7,Big Bang Theory,63,12
32148,Raj,4," Come on, dude, you're being too hard on yourself. You've got a lot of good stuff going on.",7,Big Bang Theory,91,18
32150,Raj,4," Well, okay, you're a, you're a talented artist, you own your own business.",7,Big Bang Theory,75,13
32152,Raj,4," Okay, well, can we imply that you're well-endowed?",7,Big Bang Theory,51,8
32154,Raj,4," Okay, now you're talking like a winner!",7,Big Bang Theory,40,7
32156,Leonard,4, Whatcha doin'?,7,Big Bang Theory,15,2
32157,Sheldon,4," Oh, it turns out Amy's beloved Pride and Prejudice is a flawless masterpiece. He's got too much pride, she's got too much prejudice, it just works.",7,Big Bang Theory,148,26
32158,Leonard,4, So you're looking to ruin something for her in the funny pages?,7,Big Bang Theory,64,12
32159,Sheldon,4, Amy has a fondness for the comic strip Marmaduke.,7,Big Bang Theory,50,9
32160,Leonard,4, Mm-hmm. And?,7,Big Bang Theory,13,2
32161,Sheldon,4," And I think I've got it. Consider, a family possesses a dog that is so large and poorly disciplined, he causes nothing but problems. Why do they keep him?",7,Big Bang Theory,155,29
32162,Leonard,4, Maybe they fell in love with him as a puppy and didn't know how big he was gonna be.,7,Big Bang Theory,85,19
32163,Sheldon,4," Of course. You know, why couldn't she just like Ziggy? Yeah? That thing's riddled with plot holes.",7,Big Bang Theory,99,17
32164,Leonard,4," Sorry, buddy.",7,Big Bang Theory,14,2
32165,Sheldon,4," Ooh, I think she's a fan of Garfield as well. Oh, darn it, now so am I.",7,Big Bang Theory,72,17
32166,Leonard,4, I'll see you later. I gotta go watch a stupid football game with Penny.,7,Big Bang Theory,72,14
32167,Sheldon,4," Wait, hang on. You've spent time with Amy. Can you think of anything she's fond of that has a bunch of flaws she hasn't noticed?",7,Big Bang Theory,129,25
32168,Leonard,4, I gotta go.,7,Big Bang Theory,12,3
32170,Leonard,4, You ready to go?,7,Big Bang Theory,17,4
32171,Penny,4," Yep. Hey, and maybe this time you don't try and talk sports with the guys.",7,Big Bang Theory,75,15
32172,Leonard,4, Some sports bar. It's like they never even heard of Quidditch. Do we really have to go?,7,Big Bang Theory,88,17
32173,Penny,4," Oh, come on. Every time we're about to hang out with my friends, you don't want to. It's like, It's too loud, or the bathroom's too dirty, or they put a chicken wing in my ear. I mean",7,Big Bang Theory,184,38
32174,Leonard,4," Well, you're, you're right. Let's just go.",7,Big Bang Theory,43,7
32175,Penny,4," Hey, what's going on with you?",7,Big Bang Theory,31,6
32176,Leonard,4," Nothing, I'm fine.",7,Big Bang Theory,19,3
32177,Penny,4," All right, hang on. is this still about your mom's book?",7,Big Bang Theory,57,11
32178,Leonard,4, No. Not everything is about my mom. ,7,Big Bang Theory,37,7
32179,Penny,4," â€˜Cause if you're still upset about that, we don't have to go.",7,Big Bang Theory,64,12
32180,Leonard,4, Except this is totally about my mom.,7,Big Bang Theory,37,7
32181,Penny,4, I'm so sorry. I never should have read that book. You know what? You want to just get dinner and watch the game here?,7,Big Bang Theory,118,24
32182,Leonard,4, That sounds nice. Yeah.,7,Big Bang Theory,24,4
32183,Penny,4, Okay.,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
32184,Leonard,4," Or, you know, we could get take-out and watch the Blu-ray extended version of The Hobbit movie with commentary track. On account of how sad I am about my mom.",7,Big Bang Theory,159,30
32186,Howard,4," Leonard, you ready for lunch?",7,Big Bang Theory,30,5
32187,Leonard,4, One sec. Hey. Sorry.,7,Big Bang Theory,21,4
32188,Howard,4," Hi, Penny.",7,Big Bang Theory,11,2
32189,Penny,4," Hi. All right, sweetie. You hang in there today.",7,Big Bang Theory,49,9
32190,Leonard,4," I'll try, but I might be sad again tonight.",7,Big Bang Theory,44,9
32191,Penny,4, Okay.,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
32192,Howard,4, Wow. Sex at work?,7,Big Bang Theory,18,4
32193,Leonard,4, Leave it alone. That's my girlfriend.,7,Big Bang Theory,38,6
32194,Howard,4, Sorry. ,7,Big Bang Theory,8,1
32195,Leonard,4, Who just had sex with me at work.,7,Big Bang Theory,34,8
32196,Howard,4, Damn. How'd you swing that?,7,Big Bang Theory,28,5
32197,Leonard,4," Well, whenever I talk about how awful my mom was, Penny will do anything to make me feel better.",7,Big Bang Theory,97,19
32198,Howard,4, Seriously?,7,Big Bang Theory,11,1
32199,Leonard,4," Look, I mean, I'm not proud of it, but it does work. I got her to watch a six-part documentary on Monty Python. Even I was bored, I just wanted to see if she'd make it to the end.",7,Big Bang Theory,180,39
32200,Howard,4, You sound kind of proud of it.,7,Big Bang Theory,31,7
32201,Leonard,4," I am, I'm really proud.",7,Big Bang Theory,24,5
32203,Amy,4," Hello, Sheldon. Is everything okay?",7,Big Bang Theory,36,5
32204,Sheldon,4, Yes. Why?,7,Big Bang Theory,10,2
32205,Amy,4," Well, the last time you made an unscheduled video-chat, there was a curly fry in your regular fries and you thought someone might be trying to slip you a mickey.",7,Big Bang Theory,162,30
32206,Sheldon,4," April 13, a dark night, indeed.",7,Big Bang Theory,32,6
32207,Amy,4, So what can I do for you?,7,Big Bang Theory,26,7
32208,Sheldon,4, I'm calling to invite you to a spontaneous date night tomorrow evening.,7,Big Bang Theory,72,12
32209,Amy,4, Really?,7,Big Bang Theory,8,1
32210,Sheldon,4," Yes. You were kind enough to watch Raiders of the Lost Ark with me. So I'd like to return the favour by inviting you to watch an episode of your favourite childhood television series, Little House on the Prairie.",7,Big Bang Theory,213,39
32211,Amy,4, That sounds lovely. Why are you rubbing your hands together?,7,Big Bang Theory,61,10
32212,Sheldon,4," Um, I'm putting on lotion. Are you in or not?",7,Big Bang Theory,46,10
32213,Amy,4, Of course I'm in.,7,Big Bang Theory,18,4
32214,Sheldon,4," Excellent. Then I shall see you tomorrow. Good night, Dr. Fowler.",7,Big Bang Theory,66,11
32215,Amy,4," Good night, Dr. Cooper.",7,Big Bang Theory,24,4
32216,Sheldon,4," Good night, indeed. What a rube. Why would I put on lotion when I have such soft hands?",7,Big Bang Theory,88,18
32219,Howard,4," Yeah. I guess I was just thinking about my mom, and how sad my childhood was.",7,Big Bang Theory,78,16
32221,Howard,4, How about I take a bath with you and see what happens.,7,Big Bang Theory,55,12
32223,Howard,4, That's it? No compassion?,7,Big Bang Theory,26,4
32225,Howard,4, Bernie,7,Big Bang Theory,7,1
32227,Howard,4, I'm sharing my pain.,7,Big Bang Theory,21,4
32229,Howard,4, I'm learning to be a man in a culture where it's increasingly difficult to know how?,7,Big Bang Theory,85,16
32231,Howard,4," I'm copying Leonard. When he does this to Penny, they have sex and watch Monty Python.",7,Big Bang Theory,87,16
32233,Howard,4," I know. It was dumb, I shouldn't have done it. And it's making me feel sad. So sad. You know, why don't you take a bath? I'll do the dishes.",7,Big Bang Theory,141,30
32235,Raj,4," Three, two, one. ",7,Big Bang Theory,18,3
32237,Raj,4," Attention all shoppers, my business is open for business!",7,Big Bang Theory,58,9
32239,Raj,4," Oh, cool, it tells you when someone's reading your profile. Jenny309. I hope that's not her weight. ",7,Big Bang Theory,101,17
32241,Raj,4," What? Another one. You know, it, it's weird. When they're reading your profile, does it, does it make you feel exposed? Like they see you naked?",7,Big Bang Theory,145,26
32244,Amy,4, I love Little House. It made me want to live on a farm so much I tried to milk my cat. That tangy bowl of Cheerios was not worth the stitches.,7,Big Bang Theory,143,31
32245,Sheldon,4," Well, you sit back, relax and enjoy a beloved childhood memory. You see that cabin there? I read they were illegally squatting on Indian land. Yeah. Personally, I think what we did to the Native Americans was wrong, but this is your favourite show, not mine. Oh, look at little Laura Ingalls, eating that peanut butter sandwich. Peanut butter? Huh? That's strange, since peanut butter wasn't introduced until the early 1900s. If I knew this show was about time travel, I would have watched it much sooner.",7,Big Bang Theory,506,87
32246,Amy,4, You're trying to get back at me for what I said about Raiders of the Lost Ark.,7,Big Bang Theory,79,17
32247,Sheldon,4," That's silly. Almost as silly as Dr. Baker having a telephone, since telephones only existed in large cities at that time. This is more like Little House on the Preposterous.",7,Big Bang Theory,175,30
32248,Amy,4," Sheldon, we're in a relationship. When you get angry, just tell me. You don't need to seek revenge.",7,Big Bang Theory,100,18
32249,Sheldon,4," Are you sure? Every time my dad stayed out all night, my mom would put hamster poop in his chewing tobacco.",7,Big Bang Theory,108,21
32250,Amy,4," Well, that's not how we're going to do it.",7,Big Bang Theory,43,9
32251,Sheldon,4," Fine. I'm mad at you. Not only did you ruin Raiders for me, you may have ruined the whole franchise. Except for the fourth one, which was bad before you got your mitts on it.",7,Big Bang Theory,175,35
32252,Amy,4, I shouldn't have said it. I'm sorry.,7,Big Bang Theory,37,7
32253,Sheldon,4, Thank you.,7,Big Bang Theory,11,2
32254,Amy,4, Do you feel better?,7,Big Bang Theory,20,4
32255,Sheldon,4, Yes. But not as good as I'm going to when I tell you that your precious Garfield has no reason to hate Mondays. He's a cat. He doesn't have a job.,7,Big Bang Theory,147,31
32257,Leonard,4," Hey, I was just what is happening?",7,Big Bang Theory,35,7
32258,Penny,4," Oh, just a little treat. I know you've been feeling really bad about your mom lately.",7,Big Bang Theory,86,16
32259,Leonard,4," Oh, oh, I have. So bad.",7,Big Bang Theory,24,6
32260,Penny,4," And I wanted to make you feel better, so I planned something very special for you.",7,Big Bang Theory,83,16
32261,Leonard,4," Uh-huh, I can already feel it working.",7,Big Bang Theory,39,7
32263,Leonard,4, Mom?,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
32265,Leonard,4, I uh,7,Big Bang Theory,5,2
32266,Penny,4, Bernadette told me everything. Now you don't get the left or the right.,7,Big Bang Theory,72,13
32268,Leonard,4," Oh, please, Mommy. No, Mommy.",7,Big Bang Theory,30,5
32270,Leonard,4, I didn't dream that?,7,Big Bang Theory,21,4
32272,Leonard,4," Penny, come back. I'm sad for real now.",7,Big Bang Theory,40,8
32274,Raj,4," In the last two hours, 162 women have read our profiles. How many of them have sent us messages?",7,Big Bang Theory,97,19
32276,Raj,4, Yes.,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
32278,Raj,4," Dude, this is, this is brutal. ",7,Big Bang Theory,32,6
32280,Raj,4," This is the worst. If we're gonna get shot down, we might as well just go to a bar and do it old school.",7,Big Bang Theory,105,24
32282,Raj,4," Yeah, anything is better than this.",7,Big Bang Theory,36,6
32284,Raj,4, Hello.,7,Big Bang Theory,7,1
32286,Raj,4, I was wrong. This is worse.,7,Big Bang Theory,28,6
32288,Howard,4," Wait, wait, if it wasn't for Indiana Jones, the ark would never have ended up at the warehouse. ",7,Big Bang Theory,97,18
32289,Sheldon,4, That's true. He collected and delivered the ark to the proper authorities for filing.,7,Big Bang Theory,86,14
32290,Raj,4, Like a hero.,7,Big Bang Theory,13,3
32292,Leonard,4," Although, technically, Indy was supposed to take the ark to a museum to be studied. He couldn't even get that done.",7,Big Bang Theory,116,21
32295,Penny,5," Awkward silence, Sheldon on his phone, no touching. Somebody's having date night.",7,Big Bang Theory,82,12
32296,Amy,5, It's actually steamier than it looks. Sheldon's looking up the phallic symbolism of root vegetables in Renaissance paintings.,7,Big Bang Theory,126,18
32297,Sheldon,5," Oh, no, I got bored with that. I'm just browsing cuticle scissors on Amazon.",7,Big Bang Theory,77,14
32298,Penny,5, How do you not tear off his clothes and take him right here on this table?,7,Big Bang Theory,75,16
32299,Sheldon,5," If you do that, I'll scream.",7,Big Bang Theory,29,6
32300,Amy,5," Sheldon, I have some exciting news to tell you.",7,Big Bang Theory,48,9
32301,Sheldon,5," That makes two of us. My new cuticle scissors will be here in one to two business days. Come on, one.",7,Big Bang Theory,102,21
32302,Amy,5, I've been invited to consult on an experiment at your university for a few months. Isn't that great? We could have lunch together. We could carpool. ,7,Big Bang Theory,150,26
32303,Sheldon,5," You know, riding with Leonard has gotten a little tedious lately. The only car game he ever wants to play is the Quiet Game. And he's terrible at it, I always win.",7,Big Bang Theory,164,32
32304,Amy,5," So, you're okay with this?",7,Big Bang Theory,27,5
32305,Sheldon,5," Well, why wouldn't I be?",7,Big Bang Theory,25,5
32306,Amy,5," Well, this project would have us working in close proximity to one another. And there's the vulgar adage that one should not defecate where one eats.",7,Big Bang Theory,150,26
32307,Sheldon,5," My father used to say that all the time. That and, um, who does one have to orally gratify to get a drink around here? But what does that have to do with you working at the university?",7,Big Bang Theory,185,38
32308,Amy,5," Sheldon, don't defecate where you eat means don't have a romantic relationship in the workplace.",7,Big Bang Theory,97,15
32309,Sheldon,5, Really?,7,Big Bang Theory,8,1
32310,Amy,5, Yes.,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
32311,Sheldon,5," Huh. Yeah, I always took it literally. That's why I have never once moved my bowels in this or any restaurant. Hmm.",7,Big Bang Theory,116,22
32312,Amy,5, I'm relieved that you don't have a problem with us working together.,7,Big Bang Theory,69,12
32313,Sheldon,5," Not as relieved as I'm about to be. It's a brave new world, little lady.",7,Big Bang Theory,73,15
32315,Howard,5, Are you crazy? You don't want your girlfriend at work with you. Hell Clam.,7,Big Bang Theory,75,14
32316,Sheldon,5, Why not? Hairy Fairy.,7,Big Bang Theory,22,4
32317,Raj,5," I think it could be romantic. You know, my parents met at his place of work. ",7,Big Bang Theory,78,16
32318,Leonard,5, Your father's a gynaecologist.,7,Big Bang Theory,31,4
32319,Raj,5," I know. What started as a pap smear turned into a date. Which turned into her working there, which turned into marriage, which then turned into hatred, which continues to this day. Two-Eyed Cyclops.",7,Big Bang Theory,199,34
32320,Howard,5, Would you please tell him this isn't a good idea?,7,Big Bang Theory,50,10
32321,Leonard,5," No, no, I think it'll be great. Maybe next time he gets conjunctivitis at work, she can hold his head and try to put the drops in his eyes. Giant baby.",7,Big Bang Theory,152,31
32322,Sheldon,5, That's a Raging Ogre.,7,Big Bang Theory,22,4
32323,Leonard,5," Yeah, I know.",7,Big Bang Theory,14,3
32324,Howard,5," I'm just saying, I'd never want to work with Bernadette. Can you imagine seeing someone all day long and then you're supposed to hang out with them after work, too?",7,Big Bang Theory,165,30
32325,Raj,5, Hold on. We do that all the time. You and I work together and play together.,7,Big Bang Theory,77,16
32326,Howard,5," Yeah, I know, and it drove me into the arms of another woman. Bipolar Bear.",7,Big Bang Theory,76,15
32327,Sheldon,5," Well, I appreciate your concern, but I won't be seeing any more of Amy than I already do. I assume we'll deduct any extra time we spend together at work from our weekly quota.",7,Big Bang Theory,176,34
32328,Leonard,5, Please let me be there when you tell her that.,7,Big Bang Theory,47,10
32329,Sheldon,5, Why? So you can see the look on Amy's face when she hears my top-notch idea?,7,Big Bang Theory,77,16
32330,Leonard,5," Please, oh, please, just let me be there.",7,Big Bang Theory,42,8
32333,Amy,5, I'm leading a study to see if deficiency of the monoamine oxidase enzyme leads to paralyzing fear in monkeys.,7,Big Bang Theory,110,19
32335,Amy,5," Wait, you've, you've done this experiment on humans?",7,Big Bang Theory,53,8
32337,Penny,5," You know, not a lot of people know this, but the monoamine oxidase enzyme was discovered by a woman, Mary Bernheim. That's right, my phone is just as smart as you guys.",7,Big Bang Theory,169,32
32338,Sheldon,5,"  Amy, Bernadette, Penny.  Amy, Bernadette, Penny.  Amy, Bernadette, Penny.",7,Big Bang Theory,75,9
32340,Amy,5, I don't mind. I'm hoping to put his love of repetition to good use someday.,7,Big Bang Theory,76,15
32341,Sheldon,5," Hi. Um, I've reconsidered. Uh, you can't work where I work. Enjoy the rest of your evening.",7,Big Bang Theory,92,17
32342,Amy,5, Sheldon. I already signed the contract. I cashed a cheque. ,7,Big Bang Theory,60,10
32343,Sheldon,5," Mmm, you are not going to come out of this looking good.",7,Big Bang Theory,57,12
32344,Penny,5," Sheldon, I don't understand. I thought you said you were fine with it.",7,Big Bang Theory,71,13
32345,Sheldon,5," Well, I was. But that was before Howard explained to me how awful it would be if he had to work with his significant other.",7,Big Bang Theory,124,25
32347,Sheldon,5," Now, don't be insulted. He just thinks too much of you would be mind-numbingly tedious. ",7,Big Bang Theory,89,15
32349,Sheldon,5," Yeah, well, now, well, keep it short. From what I gather, brevity is your friend. So, are we good here?",7,Big Bang Theory,104,20
32350,Amy,5," No, we're not good here. I am working on this project.",7,Big Bang Theory,55,11
32351,Penny,5," Yeah, and you can't tell her what she can and cannot do.",7,Big Bang Theory,57,12
32352,Sheldon,5," Last week, you told Leonard he couldn't wear his Wookie jacket out in public.",7,Big Bang Theory,78,14
32353,Penny,5, That's different. I'm not going to the mall with someone dressed like a dumb space bear.,7,Big Bang Theory,89,16
32354,Amy,5," Sheldon, you don't have to worry about me bothering you. I'll be in a different building. And we don't even have to have lunch together.",7,Big Bang Theory,137,25
32355,Sheldon,5, Really?,7,Big Bang Theory,8,1
32356,Amy,5," Yes. Before all things, I'm a scientist. I'm just there to do my work and, with a little luck, scare the living crap out of some monkeys.",7,Big Bang Theory,138,27
32357,Sheldon,5, Hmm. You sure your mothlike personality won't be drawn to this blazing fire that is myself?,7,Big Bang Theory,92,16
32358,Amy,5, More and more sure.,7,Big Bang Theory,20,4
32359,Sheldon,5," Well, then, you have my permission.",7,Big Bang Theory,36,6
32360,Amy,5, I didn't ask for your permission.,7,Big Bang Theory,34,6
32361,Sheldon,5, Too late. No backsies.,7,Big Bang Theory,23,4
32362,Howard,5," No, no, listen to me. Sheldon misunderstood. What I meant was, if we worked together, there'd be too much of me for you, not the other way around.",7,Big Bang Theory,147,28
32363,Sheldon,5," Howard, if you're going to lie to your wife, don't start the sentence with Sheldon misunderstood. That's a dead giveaway.",7,Big Bang Theory,122,20
32365,Howard,5," Okay, fine. I did say that, and I think it's true. I think if we worked together and lived together, we'd get sick of each other.",7,Big Bang Theory,130,26
32366,Sheldon,5," Yeah, but to be fair, he only said the part about him getting sick of you.",7,Big Bang Theory,75,16
32367,Howard,5," For the love of God, why?",7,Big Bang Theory,26,6
32369,Raj,5, His only options here are to fake a heart attack or have a real one.,7,Big Bang Theory,69,15
32370,Howard,5, It's nothing in particular. I,7,Big Bang Theory,30,5
32372,Howard,5, My arm is feeling numb.,7,Big Bang Theory,24,5
32373,Leonard,5, Nailed it.,7,Big Bang Theory,11,2
32375,Howard,5," My point is, I'm sure there are things about me that would drive you crazy if you had to deal with them all day long.",7,Big Bang Theory,118,25
32377,Howard,5," Oh, well, come on, where am I supposed to look when I lie to you?",7,Big Bang Theory,66,15
32379,Howard,5, Bernie,7,Big Bang Theory,7,1
32380,Sheldon,5," If it makes you feel any better, Amy and I are fine. I mean, really good.",7,Big Bang Theory,74,16
32382,Leonard,5," So, boys, how was the pyjama party? You guys jump on the bed and sing into hair brushes?",7,Big Bang Theory,89,18
32383,Raj,5," It wasn't a pyjama party. It was just a couple of bros hanging out, giggling, eating cookie dough and watching Princess Bride.",7,Big Bang Theory,127,22
32384,Howard,5," Please, stop talking.",7,Big Bang Theory,22,3
32385,Raj,5, As you wish.,7,Big Bang Theory,13,3
32386,Howard,5," I mean, you know, Sheldon, none of this would've happened if I hadn't tried to help you.",7,Big Bang Theory,89,17
32387,Sheldon,5," Uh, it also wouldn't have happened if, in the early universe, hydrogen was a little more common or a little less common. This is fun. Your turn.",7,Big Bang Theory,145,27
32388,Amy,5, Gentlemen.,7,Big Bang Theory,11,1
32389,Raj,5, Amy.,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
32390,Leonard,5, Hey.,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
32391,Sheldon,5, Hello.,7,Big Bang Theory,7,1
32392,Leonard,5, That was kind of icy. You two okay?,7,Big Bang Theory,36,8
32393,Sheldon,5," Oh, we're fine. As Howard advised, she's merely respecting our professional boundaries.",7,Big Bang Theory,88,12
32394,Leonard,5, Smart. Take relationship advice from a man who spent last night braiding Raj's hair.,7,Big Bang Theory,85,14
32395,Sheldon,5," Yeah, you make a good point. It would appear I was worried for nothing. Look at her, desperately wishing she was over here at the cool table. Don't worry, little moth. The flame will come to you.",7,Big Bang Theory,196,37
32396,Raj,5," Oh, uh, on the off chance that Bernadette doesn't call back and apologize, how do you feel about Mexican food for dinner tonight?",7,Big Bang Theory,130,23
32397,Howard,5, I don't know. Sounds kind of heavy.,7,Big Bang Theory,36,7
32398,Raj,5, That's 'cause you always fill up on chips.,7,Big Bang Theory,43,8
32399,Amy,5, And this is Dr. Gunderson from Stockholm.,7,Big Bang Theory,42,7
32400,Sheldon,5," Ah, Sweden. Yeah, home of my favourite Muppet and, uh, second favourite meatball. Okay, the Nordic reputation for lack of humour is well-founded. Boy, is his name Gunderson or No-Funderson?",7,Big Bang Theory,190,30
32401,Amy,5," Where are we going with this, Dr. Cooper?",7,Big Bang Theory,42,8
32402,Sheldon,5," Oh, please, I'm your boyfriend. You call me Sheldon. That's right, I am in a boy-girl relationship with this cute little lump of wool.",7,Big Bang Theory,135,24
32403,Amy,5, Sheldon.,7,Big Bang Theory,9,1
32404,Sheldon,5," It's a physical relationship, too. Hand-holding, hugging, even on hot days. Ow. Okay, here's a new one. Apparently now we kick each other in the shin under the table. How do you like it when I do it to you? Not so much, huh?",7,Big Bang Theory,225,44
32406,Amy,5," Test subject D7, aka Betsy, fear response study. Image number one, Frenchman on bicycle carrying baguettes. No visible reaction. Image number two, sousaphone. Still no reaction. Okay. Let's kick things up a notch. Image number three, crocodile with a mouthful of monkeys. Okay, now we're talking.",7,Big Bang Theory,297,46
32407,Sheldon,5, Dr. Fowler?,7,Big Bang Theory,12,2
32408,Amy,5," What do you want, Sheldon?",7,Big Bang Theory,27,5
32409,Sheldon,5," Well, I'm done with work, so ugh!",7,Big Bang Theory,34,7
32410,Amy,5," Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry. Sorry, uh, better?",7,Big Bang Theory,44,7
32411,Sheldon,5," Oh, baguettes. Yes, I like baguettes. What exactly are you doing?",7,Big Bang Theory,66,11
32412,Amy,5, Determining baseline fear levels in capuchin monkeys by measuring their response to visual stimuli.,7,Big Bang Theory,100,14
32413,Sheldon,5," So, goofing off. As I was saying, I'm done with work and Leonard's not. So good news, you get to take me home. Play your cards right, I'll let you drive me past the lot where the buses park at night.",7,Big Bang Theory,200,41
32414,Amy,5," I can't leave now, Sheldon. I'm very busy. Besides, why would I want to do you a favour after the way you treated me in the cafeteria? Image number four, boa constrictor. ",7,Big Bang Theory,172,32
32415,Sheldon,5, What on earth are you talking about? My behaviour in the cafeteria was delightful. Maybe your friend Gunderson needs to head over to IKEA and assemble a sense of humour.,7,Big Bang Theory,170,30
32416,Amy,5," You embarrassed me in front of my colleagues on my first day here. Image number five, kitten in a teacup.",7,Big Bang Theory,106,20
32417,Sheldon,5, Aw. Embarrassed you?,7,Big Bang Theory,21,3
32418,Amy,5, You know what? I don't have time for this. Find another way home.,7,Big Bang Theory,66,13
32419,Sheldon,5, I'm starting to get the sense that you're angry with me.,7,Big Bang Theory,57,11
32420,Amy,5, Really? What tipped you off?,7,Big Bang Theory,29,5
32421,Sheldon,5," Couple things, actually. Your tone of voice, your body language",7,Big Bang Theory,64,10
32422,Amy,5, Get out.,7,Big Bang Theory,9,2
32423,Sheldon,5," Well, now, that.",7,Big Bang Theory,17,3
32424,Amy,5," Image number six, woman giving birth.",7,Big Bang Theory,38,6
32425,Sheldon,5, Bleugh!,7,Big Bang Theory,8,1
32427,Leonard,5," It's nine o'clock, where you been?",7,Big Bang Theory,35,6
32428,Sheldon,5," Oh, I had to take the bus home. Fell asleep and missed my stop.",7,Big Bang Theory,64,14
32429,Penny,5," Oh, no.",7,Big Bang Theory,8,2
32430,Sheldon,5, Did you know that Los Angeles has a Little Sri Lanka?,7,Big Bang Theory,54,11
32431,Leonard,5, I did not.,7,Big Bang Theory,11,3
32432,Sheldon,5," Well, I do now. They're a lovely people. Although terrifying when you wake up face-to-face with them. If you're hungry, I brought home some mutton and coconut milk.",7,Big Bang Theory,165,28
32433,Penny,5, Why'd you get that? You hate lamb.,7,Big Bang Theory,35,7
32434,Sheldon,5," I was asking for directions. Apparently, there was a communication problem.",7,Big Bang Theory,76,11
32435,Leonard,5, I thought Amy was gonna drive you home.,7,Big Bang Theory,40,8
32436,Sheldon,5," Yeah, I thought so, too, but she's acting very strangely. I was discussing it with a Sri Lankan fellow on the bus, and he hypothesized that a tiger may have recently run across her shadow. Although he may have just been trying to drum up business for his brother-in-law's witch doctor practice.",7,Big Bang Theory,295,52
32437,Penny,5," Okay, Sheldon, what happened between you and Amy?",7,Big Bang Theory,50,8
32438,Sheldon,5," Well, can you believe she said I embarrassed her?",7,Big Bang Theory,50,9
32439,Penny,5, Yeah.,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
32440,Sheldon,5, But you didn't even hear the details.,7,Big Bang Theory,38,7
32441,Leonard,5," Sheldon, I've known you a long time, and I'm going to tell you this with all the love I can possibly muster. Amy's right. You're wrong.",7,Big Bang Theory,136,26
32442,Sheldon,5, But you don't even know,7,Big Bang Theory,24,5
32443,Leonard,5, Doesn't matter.,7,Big Bang Theory,16,2
32444,Sheldon,5," But, now, but in my defence",7,Big Bang Theory,28,6
32445,Leonard,5, Doesn't matter.,7,Big Bang Theory,16,2
32446,Sheldon,5, You're not listening to my side of it.,7,Big Bang Theory,39,8
32447,Penny,5," Okay, fine, Sheldon. What is your side?",7,Big Bang Theory,40,7
32448,Sheldon,5, Well,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
32449,Penny,5," Nope, got to go with Amy on this one.",7,Big Bang Theory,38,9
32451,Howard,5," Ooh, shrimp was spicy.",7,Big Bang Theory,23,4
32452,Raj,5, You want a TUMS?,7,Big Bang Theory,17,4
32453,Howard,5, You got the tropical fruit kind?,7,Big Bang Theory,33,6
32454,Raj,5," No, if I buy those, I just go through them like candy.",7,Big Bang Theory,55,12
32455,Howard,5," Tell me about it. One time, I swear I pooped out a stick of chalk.  I'll get it.",7,Big Bang Theory,81,18
32456,Raj,5, Thanks.,7,Big Bang Theory,8,1
32458,Howard,5," Oh, hi.",7,Big Bang Theory,8,2
32460,Howard,5," Yeah, well, I didn't handle it so great, either.",7,Big Bang Theory,49,9
32462,Howard,5, That's not true.,7,Big Bang Theory,17,3
32464,Howard,5," Oh, wow. Yeah, no, I get that. I'm so sorry. Starting tomorrow, I am turning over a new leaf. Time with you is my number one priority.",7,Big Bang Theory,135,27
32466,Howard,5," Well, we're real close to finishing off the new Batman game.",7,Big Bang Theory,61,11
32467,Raj,5," It is awesome. Uh, you should probably go after her.",7,Big Bang Theory,53,10
32468,Howard,5, Should I go after you?,7,Big Bang Theory,23,5
32470,Howard,5, Thanks for getting me in trouble.,7,Big Bang Theory,34,6
32472,Sheldon,5,  Amy.  Amy.  Amy.,7,Big Bang Theory,18,3
32473,Amy,5," Sheldon, what are you doing here so late?",7,Big Bang Theory,42,8
32474,Sheldon,5," I couldn't sleep because I kept thinking about what happened earlier between us. Also, I had one heck of a bus nap. Oh, speaking of which, do you want some mutton and coconut milk?",7,Big Bang Theory,181,34
32475,Amy,5, No.,7,Big Bang Theory,4,1
32476,Sheldon,5," Well, I cannot give this stuff away.",7,Big Bang Theory,37,7
32477,Amy,5, What do you want?,7,Big Bang Theory,18,4
32478,Sheldon,5," Amy, this isn't easy to say. All relationships are difficult, but even more so when you're in one with a person who struggles with everyday social interactions. And frankly, who can strike some people as being kind of a weirdo.",7,Big Bang Theory,228,40
32479,Amy,5," Sheldon, you're not a weirdo.",7,Big Bang Theory,30,5
32480,Sheldon,5," I wasn't speaking about me. I mean, honestly, there's no telling what will set you off. You know, introducing myself as your boyfriend. Giving you the opportunity to drive me home. Breaking the ice with your colleagues using ethnic humour, the funniest kind of humour.",7,Big Bang Theory,269,45
32481,Amy,5, What's your point?,7,Big Bang Theory,19,3
32482,Sheldon,5," My point is, we're a couple, and I like you for who you are, quirks and all.",7,Big Bang Theory,77,17
32483,Amy,5," I like you, too.",7,Big Bang Theory,17,4
32484,Sheldon,5," Well, I should hope so. I don't see anyone else banging on this door to put up with your nonsense. Not even a good-bye? You see, that's the kind of thing that makes people think you're weird. Poor kid. She just doesn't see it.",7,Big Bang Theory,227,44
32487,Amy,5," Sheldon, too. If I see him at work, I'm just going to ignore him.",7,Big Bang Theory,66,14
32488,Penny,5," All right, don't worry. I talked to Leonard. He is gonna sit the guys down and set them straight.",7,Big Bang Theory,98,19
32490,Leonard,5, Laser's warmed up.,7,Big Bang Theory,19,3
32491,Howard,5, Pull.,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
32494,Penny,6, What are you working on?,7,Big Bang Theory,25,5
32495,Sheldon,6, Can't talk. In the zone.,7,Big Bang Theory,25,5
32496,Penny,6, Do you know what he's doing?,7,Big Bang Theory,29,6
32497,Amy,6," Could be anything. Last time he was like this, he figured out electron transport in graphene. The time before that, he was making a list of who's allowed in his tree fort if fe ever gets one. Still can't believe I didn't make the cut.",7,Big Bang Theory,235,45
32498,Penny,6," Uh, Sheldon, you want to take a break? Your food's ready.",7,Big Bang Theory,58,11
32499,Leonard,6," No, no, what are you doing? He's both happy and quiet. It's like seeing a unicorn and Bigfoot at the same time.",7,Big Bang Theory,112,22
32500,Howard,6, Sorry we're so late. Bernadette got stuck at work.,7,Big Bang Theory,51,9
32502,Raj,6, Why is that great news?,7,Big Bang Theory,24,5
32504,Howard,6," Wait, Maybe you want to wash your little raccoon hands first.",7,Big Bang Theory,62,11
32506,Howard,6," Guys, listen up. ",7,Big Bang Theory,18,3
32507,Sheldon,6," Can't listen, zone. Also don't care.",7,Big Bang Theory,37,6
32508,Howard,6, Next week is the anniversary of my first date with Bernadette.,7,Big Bang Theory,63,11
32509,Sheldon,6, Really don't care.,7,Big Bang Theory,19,3
32510,Howard,6," I want to do something special, and I was hoping you guys could be a part of it.",7,Big Bang Theory,81,18
32511,Penny,6," Aw, what horrible thing are you trying to make up for?",7,Big Bang Theory,55,11
32512,Howard,6, Just putting something in the bank for what horrible thing I do next.,7,Big Bang Theory,70,13
32513,Penny,6, Ah.,7,Big Bang Theory,4,1
32514,Howard,6," Look, she's gonna be back any second, so here's the deal. I'm writing a song, and I was hoping we could all play it for her together.",7,Big Bang Theory,134,27
32515,Leonard,6, Aw.,7,Big Bang Theory,4,1
32516,Amy,6," Oh, I love that.",7,Big Bang Theory,17,4
32517,Raj,6, That is so beautiful.,7,Big Bang Theory,22,4
32518,Howard,6, Sheldon?,7,Big Bang Theory,9,1
32519,Sheldon,6, When did we get to the Cheesecake Factory?,7,Big Bang Theory,43,8
32521,Leonard,6, It's really sweet what Howard wants to do for Bernadette.,7,Big Bang Theory,58,10
32522,Penny,6," Yeah. Hey, how come you've never done anything romantic to celebrate our first date?",7,Big Bang Theory,85,14
32523,Leonard,6," Well, for starters, you've broken up with me so many times, which first date are we talking about?",7,Big Bang Theory,99,18
32524,Sheldon,6," Ooh, somebody call the burn ward. And back to the zone.",7,Big Bang Theory,56,11
32525,Leonard,6," And besides, I do romantic things for you all the time. Can you even name one romantic thing you've done for me?",7,Big Bang Theory,113,22
32526,Penny,6, I can name tons.,7,Big Bang Theory,17,4
32527,Leonard,6, Sex doesn't count.,7,Big Bang Theory,19,3
32528,Penny,6," Oh. I know, what about that bed-and-breakfast?",7,Big Bang Theory,47,7
32529,Leonard,6," Well, I took you there. All you did was",7,Big Bang Theory,40,9
32530,Penny,6," I know what I did. I bet they had to throw out that rocking chair. You know, I can be romantic if I want to.",7,Big Bang Theory,109,25
32531,Leonard,6, It's fine. And also not true.,7,Big Bang Theory,30,6
32532,Penny,6," Okay, just you wait and see. I'm gonna romance your freakin' ass off.",7,Big Bang Theory,70,13
32533,Leonard,6, That's beautiful. Is that Shakespeare?,7,Big Bang Theory,39,5
32534,Penny,6, Sheldon?,7,Big Bang Theory,9,1
32535,Sheldon,6, Zone.,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
32536,Leonard,6, He'll figure it out when he falls off the roof.,7,Big Bang Theory,48,10
32538,Leonard,6," Sheldon, I know you're in the zone, but do you want some tea? All right, I can't believe I'm gonna say this, but you haven't spoken in hours and I'm starting to get worried. Please say something.",7,Big Bang Theory,196,37
32539,Sheldon,6," Leonard, prepare to be humbled and weep at the glory of my genius.",7,Big Bang Theory,67,13
32540,Leonard,6," Nope, it was better before.",7,Big Bang Theory,28,5
32541,Sheldon,6," Look at it. I feel like my mind just made a baby. And it's beautiful. It's not like human babies, which are loud and covered in goop.",7,Big Bang Theory,134,27
32542,Leonard,6," Holy crap, Sheldon, did you just figure out a method for synthesizing a new stable super-heavy element?",7,Big Bang Theory,104,17
32543,Sheldon,6," Did I? Well, that can't be right. No one's ever done that before. Except me, because I just did it. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain",7,Big Bang Theory,238,44
32544,Leonard,6," Yeah, definitely better before.",7,Big Bang Theory,32,4
32546,Howard,6, So I'm almost done writing the song for Bernadette. Are you cool playing the cello?,7,Big Bang Theory,84,15
32547,Leonard,6," If by cool you mean willing to, yes. If by cool you mean cool, clearly you've never seen me play the cello.",7,Big Bang Theory,108,22
32548,Howard,6, Great. Will you play the ukulele?,7,Big Bang Theory,34,6
32549,Raj,6, Of course. I'd be happy to shred it on my ax.,7,Big Bang Theory,46,11
32550,Howard,6," Or you could just play your tiny, ridiculous guitar.",7,Big Bang Theory,53,9
32551,Raj,6, Fine. I will melt her heart. And her face.,7,Big Bang Theory,43,9
32552,Sheldon,6," Gentlemen. Uh, no doubt you heard about my little breakthrough. Now, if your plan is to hoist me on your shoulders and carry me around the cafeteria, please refrain. I don't care for heights, motion sickness or the thought of your necks touching my buttocks. ",7,Big Bang Theory,260,45
32553,Howard,6," Seriously, congratulations, Sheldon.",7,Big Bang Theory,37,3
32554,Raj,6," Yeah, I read your paper online. That technique for creating a new heavy element is inspired.",7,Big Bang Theory,93,16
32555,Sheldon,6," Oh, well, thank you. Believe it or not, I just learned a Chinese research team at the Hubei Institute for Nuclear Physics ran a test on a cyclotron, and the results were extremely promising.",7,Big Bang Theory,191,34
32556,Leonard,6," Sheldon, that's incredible.",7,Big Bang Theory,28,3
32557,Sheldon,6," Yeah, I know. They called it the greatest thing since the Communist party. Although I'm pretty sure that the Communist party made them say that. I like China. See, they know how to keep people in line.",7,Big Bang Theory,202,37
32558,Howard,6," So, what happens next?",7,Big Bang Theory,23,4
32559,Sheldon,6," Oh, more testing, more success, more fame. Yeah, but don't worry, I will remain the same down-to-earth humble Joe I've always been.",7,Big Bang Theory,132,22
32560,Leonard,6, Good to know.,7,Big Bang Theory,14,3
32561,Sheldon,6," Now give me that cookie, I discovered an element.",7,Big Bang Theory,50,9
32563,Penny,6, Thank you so much for coming.,7,Big Bang Theory,30,6
32564,Raj,6, You called the right person. I believe I have the perfect romantic evening for you to give Leonard.,7,Big Bang Theory,100,18
32565,Penny,6," Okay, good, 'cause I've been really struggling with this.",7,Big Bang Theory,58,9
32566,Raj,6," As I'm sure you're aware, the quickest way to a man's heart is through his",7,Big Bang Theory,75,15
32567,Penny,6," Pants, but Leonard says sex doesn't count.",7,Big Bang Theory,43,7
32568,Raj,6," Oh. You poor thing. You have one arrow in your quiver, and you just can't use it. Fortunately, another pathway to a man's heart is through his stomach. ",7,Big Bang Theory,153,28
32569,Penny,6," I don't know if I want to cook for him. He's kind of a picky eater. I mean, it's too salty, it's too dry, it's too burnt and frozen at the same time. Okay, come on, what else would sweep you off your feet?",7,Big Bang Theory,206,44
32570,Raj,6," Well, I've always had this fantasy that involves dancing. The sexual chemistry between my partner and me is electric. But boy, oh, boy, does my father not approve until he sees us in the big dance competition.",7,Big Bang Theory,210,37
32571,Penny,6," Okay, that's just the plot for Dirty Dancing. What else would you love? Other than being lifted over Patrick Swayze's head.",7,Big Bang Theory,124,21
32572,Raj,6," Oh, oh, uh, you could, uh, stand outside his window with a boom box in the air.",7,Big Bang Theory,80,17
32573,Penny,6, That's from Say Anything.,7,Big Bang Theory,26,4
32574,Raj,6," Look, I'm a lonely guy, I watch a lot of movies. Look, Penny, if you truly want to be romantic, it needs to come from you.",7,Big Bang Theory,123,26
32575,Penny,6," I get that, but why is this so hard?",7,Big Bang Theory,37,9
32576,Raj,6," Well, you've probably never had to do this stuff 'cause you're young and beautiful and men have always thrown themselves at you.",7,Big Bang Theory,129,22
32577,Penny,6," Yeah, I'm trying to be sad about that. I can't.",7,Big Bang Theory,48,10
32579,Sheldon,6," Let's see, what's next? Okay, here. This is the Magic Marker I was using when I made the discovery.",7,Big Bang Theory,100,19
32580,Amy,6, I don't think the Smithsonian's gonna want your marker. ,7,Big Bang Theory,57,9
32581,Sheldon,6," And that's why you're not on a list for my tree fort. Ooh, guess who's getting an article written about him in Physics Today? I'll give you a hint. You measured the diameter of his suspicious mole yesterday.",7,Big Bang Theory,208,38
32582,Amy,6," Sheldon, I'm so proud of you.",7,Big Bang Theory,30,6
32583,Sheldon,6," Well, you should be. My discovery is spreading like wildfire. Unlike my mole, which is holding steady at the size of a navy bean.",7,Big Bang Theory,130,24
32584,Amy,6, What's next?,7,Big Bang Theory,13,2
32585,Sheldon,6, This is the very copy of The Handbook of Chemistry and Physics in which I looked up the reaction rates of mendelevium and,7,Big Bang Theory,122,23
32586,Amy,6, And what?,7,Big Bang Theory,10,2
32587,Sheldon,6," No. No, no, no, no.",7,Big Bang Theory,20,5
32588,Amy,6, What's wrong?,7,Big Bang Theory,14,2
32589,Sheldon,6, I've made a horrible mistake.,7,Big Bang Theory,30,5
32590,Amy,6, What are you talking about?,7,Big Bang Theory,28,5
32591,Sheldon,6," This table, it's in square centimetres. I read it as square metres. You know what that means?",7,Big Bang Theory,94,17
32592,Amy,6, That Americans can't handle the metric system?,7,Big Bang Theory,47,7
32593,Sheldon,6," Amy, I was off by a factor of 10,000. ",7,Big Bang Theory,39,9
32594,Amy,6, But the Chinese team found the element.,7,Big Bang Theory,40,7
32595,Sheldon,6," Yeah, well, they shouldn't have. My calculations were wrong. There must be some resonance between the elements I didn't know about.",7,Big Bang Theory,132,21
32596,Amy,6, So you just got lucky?,7,Big Bang Theory,23,5
32597,Sheldon,6, Sheldon Cooper does not get lucky.,7,Big Bang Theory,35,6
32598,Amy,6," You and me both, brother. It doesn't matter. The element was found because of you, and that's groundbreaking.",7,Big Bang Theory,110,18
32599,Sheldon,6," What matters is the greatest scientific achievement of my life is based on a blunder. I'm not a genius, I'm a fraud.",7,Big Bang Theory,117,22
32600,Amy,6," You know, Sheldon, in neuroscience, we're forever finding something in one part of the brain that we thought was someplace else.",7,Big Bang Theory,129,21
32601,Sheldon,6," Oh, great. Now I'm worse than a fraud. I'm practically a biologist.",7,Big Bang Theory,68,12
32603,Sheldon,6, There's nothing happy about it. I'm being given credit that I don't deserve. ,7,Big Bang Theory,78,13
32604,Leonard,6," Oh, people get things they don't deserve all the time. Look at me with you. ",7,Big Bang Theory,77,15
32605,Sheldon,6," No, Leonard, this is going to haunt me for the rest of my life. Every science classroom, every periodic table, every textbook, this mistake will be staring back at me. Like that time you let Koothrappali wax your eyebrows. I've got to find a way to stop this thing.",7,Big Bang Theory,266,49
32606,Leonard,6," Buddy, I don't think you can. I mean, once it's out there, it's out there. This thing is like the science equivalent of a sex tape.",7,Big Bang Theory,132,26
32607,Sheldon,6," You know, frankly, I'd prefer a sex tape.",7,Big Bang Theory,42,8
32608,Leonard,6," You don't know what a sex tape is, do you?",7,Big Bang Theory,43,10
32609,Sheldon,6, No.,7,Big Bang Theory,4,1
32611,Howard,6, Make sure you guys get to the restaurant by eight. Bernadette's meeting me there at eight thirty and I don't want to blow the surprise.,7,Big Bang Theory,136,25
32612,Leonard,6, We'll be there.,7,Big Bang Theory,16,3
32613,Raj,6," Got it. Now, uh, I have a question about the song. I was thinking at some point I could bust out a little rap.",7,Big Bang Theory,111,24
32614,Howard,6, E-Ni-Ni-Ni-Ni-No.,7,Big Bang Theory,18,1
32615,Raj,6," Come on, come on, you haven't even heard it yet. Leonard, give me a beat.",7,Big Bang Theory,74,15
32616,Leonard,6, I will not.,7,Big Bang Theory,12,3
32617,Raj,6," Oh, please?",7,Big Bang Theory,12,2
32618,Howard,6," No, I want this to be romantic.",7,Big Bang Theory,32,7
32619,Raj,6," It will be. I don't call anyone a ho, and the only time I use the phrase my bitch, I'm referring to you.",7,Big Bang Theory,105,23
32621,Sheldon,6, Stop it. Stop celebrating me.,7,Big Bang Theory,30,5
32623,Sheldon,6," And no woos. Oh, not you, Dr. Woo. You're fine. I want you all to know that you have no reason to applaud me. My so-called breakthrough wasn't the result of my genius. It was nothing more than a boneheaded mistake. So please refrain from praising me for it in the future.",7,Big Bang Theory,272,52
32624,Raj,6," Wait, I don't understand. They didn't find the element?",7,Big Bang Theory,56,9
32625,Sheldon,6," Oh, no, they found the element.  No, no, stop it. I don't need to take this admiration from the likes of you people. How do I make them stop loving me?",7,Big Bang Theory,152,31
32626,Leonard,6, Invite them to live with us.,7,Big Bang Theory,29,6
32628,Penny,6," Boy, Bernadette is gonna love this.",7,Big Bang Theory,36,6
32629,Leonard,6, Yeah. It must be nice to have someone do something so romantic.,7,Big Bang Theory,64,12
32630,Penny,6," Okay, you know what's not romantic? Rubbing it in someone's face.",7,Big Bang Theory,66,11
32631,Leonard,6," Actually, it can be, but I told you sex doesn't count.",7,Big Bang Theory,55,11
32632,Howard,6, I'm getting worried about Bernadette. I'm gonna call and check on her.,7,Big Bang Theory,71,12
32633,Sheldon,6, The National Science Foundation wants to give me a substantial grant.,7,Big Bang Theory,70,11
32634,Raj,6," Oh, that's a big deal.",7,Big Bang Theory,23,5
32635,Sheldon,6, I know. When will this nightmare end?,7,Big Bang Theory,38,7
32636,Leonard,6," Hey, I get that you feel bad about all the attention, but still, what you did is amazing. We're really proud of you.",7,Big Bang Theory,117,23
32637,Amy,6, I'm not.,7,Big Bang Theory,9,2
32638,Sheldon,6, You're not?,7,Big Bang Theory,12,2
32639,Amy,6," Sheldon, I've been thinking about it, and you're right. You don't deserve any credit. All you did was misread some numbers on a table. A very easy table, too. Honestly, I'm embarrassed for you.",7,Big Bang Theory,194,34
32640,Sheldon,6, That's the most romantic thing I've ever heard.,7,Big Bang Theory,48,8
32641,Penny,6," Damn it, everyone's better at this than me.",7,Big Bang Theory,44,8
32642,Sheldon,6," Congratulations, Dr. Fowler. You just made the fort.",7,Big Bang Theory,53,8
32643,Howard,6," Guys, there was an accident at Bernie's lab.",7,Big Bang Theory,45,8
32644,Leonard,6," Oh, my God, is she okay?",7,Big Bang Theory,25,6
32645,Howard,6," Yeah, but she's at the hospital in quarantine.",7,Big Bang Theory,47,8
32646,Penny,6, What?,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
32647,Amy,6, Poor Bernadette.,7,Big Bang Theory,17,2
32648,Leonard,6," Oh, no.",7,Big Bang Theory,8,2
32649,Sheldon,6," I hate to pile on the bad news, but I just got a raise.",7,Big Bang Theory,56,14
32651,Howard,6," Oh, my God, Bernie, what happened?",7,Big Bang Theory,35,6
32653,Howard,6, You're sure you're okay?,7,Big Bang Theory,25,4
32655,Howard,6," Oh, don't worry about it. I brought the date here. Guys, come on in.",7,Big Bang Theory,69,14
32657,Howard,6," Well, tonight is the anniversary of our first date, and I wanted to celebrate it by writing a song for you.",7,Big Bang Theory,108,21
32659,Amy,6," Sheldon, get over here.",7,Big Bang Theory,24,4
32660,Sheldon,6, She might be contagious. Don't you think I'm having a rough enough day?,7,Big Bang Theory,72,13
32661,Amy,6, Sheldon.,7,Big Bang Theory,9,1
32662,Howard,6," If I didn't have you, life would be blue, I'd be Dr. Who without the TARDIS.",7,Big Bang Theory,77,16
32663,Sheldon,6," Is it me, or does she not look so good?",7,Big Bang Theory,40,10
32664,Amy,6, Shh.,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
32665,Howard,6," A candle without a wick, a Watson without a Crick, I'd be one of my outfits without a dick-ie. I'd be cheese without the mac, Jobs without the Wozniak, I'd be solving exponential equations that use bases not found on your calculator making it much harder to crack. I'd be an atom without a bomb, a dot without the com, and I'd probably still live with my mom.",7,Big Bang Theory,360,68
32667,Howard,6," Ever since I met you, you turned my world around. You supported all my dreams and all my hopes. You're like uranium-235 and I'm uranium-238, almost inseparable isotopes. I couldn't have imagined how good my life would get from the moment that I met you Bernadette.",7,Big Bang Theory,265,46
32669,Howard,6," If I didn't have you life would be dreary, I'd be string theory without any string. I'd be binary code without a one, a cathode ray tube without an electron gun. I'd be Firefly, Buffy and Avengers without Joss Whedon. I'd speak a lot more Klingon, Heghlu'meH QaQ jajvam. ",7,Big Bang Theory,272,49
32671,Howard,6," Ever since I met you, you turned my world around. You're my best friend and my lover. We're like changing electric and magnetic fields. You can't have one without the other. I couldn't have imagined how good my life would get from the moment that I met you, Bernadette.",7,Big Bang Theory,270,49
32674,Sheldon,6," She's sick, I knew it. Bye.",7,Big Bang Theory,28,6
32676,Leonard,6," I have to say, this is the best Top Ramen you've ever made.",7,Big Bang Theory,60,13
32677,Penny,6," I discovered a secret ingredient. The flavour packet. That sucker is well named. All right, lover boy, get ready, 'cause there is a crap storm of romance coming your way.",7,Big Bang Theory,171,30
32678,Leonard,6," Stop it, you're gonna make me cry. All right. You seem pretty confident.",7,Big Bang Theory,73,13
32679,Penny,6," Oh, I am. Maybe if you follow this trail, you'll see why.",7,Big Bang Theory,58,12
32680,Leonard,6," Oh, rose petals.",7,Big Bang Theory,17,3
32681,Penny,6, Yes. The most beautiful and shockingly expensive of all the flowers.,7,Big Bang Theory,69,11
32682,Leonard,6, You made the bed? You really are pulling out all the stops.,7,Big Bang Theory,60,12
32683,Penny,6," Okay, I gave this a lot of thought, and I finally found something to show you how much I love you.",7,Big Bang Theory,99,21
32684,Leonard,6," Oh, wow.",7,Big Bang Theory,9,2
32685,Penny,6, It's a first edition of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. I remember it was your favourite book growing up.,7,Big Bang Theory,108,19
32686,Leonard,6," This is great. It, thank you, it's, so much.",7,Big Bang Theory,45,9
32687,Penny,6, What?,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
32688,Leonard,6, Nothing. I love it.,7,Big Bang Theory,20,4
32689,Penny,6, No. Something's going on. What's wrong with it? I remember you saying how great it would be to have a first edition.,7,Big Bang Theory,117,22
32690,Leonard,6," It's true, I did. I did say that. When we were at the used bookstore together and I saw the first edition and I bought it.",7,Big Bang Theory,123,26
32691,Penny,6," Oh, my God, I am the worst.",7,Big Bang Theory,28,7
32692,Leonard,6," No, no, it's okay. It's really thoughtful.",7,Big Bang Theory,43,7
32693,Penny,6," No, it's not. I mean, what's thoughtful is everything you do. Here, you know what? Look at this. Look, here's the, the plane ticket you bought me when I was too poor to go home for the holidays. And the rose you left on my windshield just because. Here's the, the thank-you letter you wrote me after the first time I slept with you. All 11 pages of it.",7,Big Bang Theory,353,69
32694,Leonard,6, I can't believe you saved all this stuff.,7,Big Bang Theory,42,8
32695,Penny,6, Of course I did. It's you.,7,Big Bang Theory,27,6
32696,Leonard,6, Come here.,7,Big Bang Theory,11,2
32697,Penny,6, Oh.,7,Big Bang Theory,4,1
32698,Leonard,6, Is that a pregnancy test?,7,Big Bang Theory,26,5
32699,Penny,6," Oh, yeah, just the first one. I didn't save them all.",7,Big Bang Theory,54,11
32701,Sheldon,6, I can't believe I read this table wrong. I blame you.,7,Big Bang Theory,54,11
32702,Amy,6, Me? What did I do?,7,Big Bang Theory,19,5
32703,Sheldon,6, You distract me. I've been distracted since the moment I met you. ,7,Big Bang Theory,67,12
32704,Amy,6, Sorry.,7,Big Bang Theory,7,1
32705,Sheldon,6," Well, you should be. Because all I can think about is how much I want to kiss you. And not just on the cheek, but on the mouth. Like mommies and daddies do.",7,Big Bang Theory,157,33
32706,Amy,6," Oh, Sheldon.",7,Big Bang Theory,13,2
32707,Sheldon,6, Amy? Amy? Did you hear what I said?,7,Big Bang Theory,36,8
32708,Amy,6," Can't talk, in the zone.",7,Big Bang Theory,25,5
32710,Amy,7, I've never seen him this happy before.,7,Big Bang Theory,39,7
32711,Leonard,7, That's because you've never seen him on restock the medicine cabinet day.,7,Big Bang Theory,74,12
32712,Sheldon,7, Look. A new topical antihistamine with lidocaine. Wow. I can't wait until I get a rash. ,7,Big Bang Theory,89,16
32713,Leonard,7," Oh, Gas-X has a new ultra strength. I guess they really do read their mail.",7,Big Bang Theory,76,15
32714,Sheldon,7," Hey, isn't that Professor Proton?",7,Big Bang Theory,34,5
32715,Leonard,7," Oh, yeah.",7,Big Bang Theory,10,2
32716,Sheldon,7," Look at him, just standing in line like he wasn't moderately famous 30 years ago. Let's go say hello.",7,Big Bang Theory,102,19
32717,Leonard,7," Oh, maybe we shouldn't bother him.",7,Big Bang Theory,35,6
32718,Sheldon,7," I'm not going to bother him, I'm going to talk to him.",7,Big Bang Theory,55,12
32719,Leonard,7, He thinks there's a difference.,7,Big Bang Theory,32,5
32720,Sheldon,7," Arthur? Arthur, it's me, Sheldon Cooper. You may not remember because of your advanced age.",7,Big Bang Theory,92,15
32722,Sheldon,7," This is my girlfriend, Amy. Amy, this is television legend Arthur Jeffries. His science show inspired millions of children.",7,Big Bang Theory,124,19
32724,Amy,7," Yes, and I've heard so much about you. Hey look, we're wearing the same orthopaedic shoes. I can't believe I dress like a celebrity.",7,Big Bang Theory,133,24
32726,Leonard,7," Dr. Jeffries, hello again. Leonard Hofstadter.",7,Big Bang Theory,47,6
32728,Leonard,7," No, she's not.",7,Big Bang Theory,15,3
32729,Sheldon,7," So, what prescription are you getting filled?",7,Big Bang Theory,46,7
32730,Leonard,7, Sheldon.,7,Big Bang Theory,9,1
32731,Sheldon,7," No. Wait, I want to guess. Don't tell me.",7,Big Bang Theory,42,9
32733,Amy,7," Sheldon, come on.",7,Big Bang Theory,18,3
32734,Sheldon,7," No, no, no. I'm really good at this. All right, give me a hint. Does it involve difficulty initiating a stream of anything?",7,Big Bang Theory,124,23
32736,Leonard,7," Hey, Sheldon, let's go mock the people buying homeopathic medicine, you love that.",7,Big Bang Theory,83,13
32737,Sheldon,7," But I'm hanging out with my friend, and we're having fun. Look how happy he is.",7,Big Bang Theory,80,16
32738,Howard,7, Bernie's having a girls' night on Friday at our place. You want to do something?,7,Big Bang Theory,81,15
32739,Raj,7," Actually, I'm busy.",7,Big Bang Theory,20,3
32740,Howard,7, Doing what?,7,Big Bang Theory,12,2
32741,Raj,7, There's a new sports bar over on Colorado Ave,7,Big Bang Theory,46,9
32742,Howard,7, You're going to girls' night.,7,Big Bang Theory,30,5
32743,Raj,7, Yeah.,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
32744,Howard,7, You know they're making jewellery right?,7,Big Bang Theory,41,6
32745,Raj,7, You think they came up with that? They were going to drink beer and play darts.,7,Big Bang Theory,80,16
32746,Leonard,7, What's up?,7,Big Bang Theory,11,2
32747,Howard,7, Not his testosterone levels.,7,Big Bang Theory,29,4
32748,Raj,7, Excuse me. I happen to be very comfortable with my masculinity.,7,Big Bang Theory,64,11
32749,Howard,7, How is that possible?,7,Big Bang Theory,22,4
32750,Leonard,7," Hey, I got an email from Professor Proton.",7,Big Bang Theory,43,8
32751,Sheldon,7, Goody. What's it say?,7,Big Bang Theory,22,4
32752,Leonard,7," He's working on a paper about nano vacuum tubes, and wants to know if I'd take a look at it.",7,Big Bang Theory,93,20
32753,Sheldon,7," That's strange. That he would come to you for that and not me. Oh, I got two emails from him. Do you have Leonard's email address? And. Never mind, I found it. I can't believe he picked you over me.",7,Big Bang Theory,199,40
32754,Howard,7, You don't want to read a paper by some old has-been who hasn't done any real science in decades.,7,Big Bang Theory,97,19
32755,Raj,7," Yeah, it's nothing to cry about.",7,Big Bang Theory,33,6
32756,Sheldon,7, Sheldon Cooper does not cry.,7,Big Bang Theory,29,5
32757,Howard,7," It's true, you'd rust.",7,Big Bang Theory,23,4
32759,Sheldon,7, And to think I idolized that man. And why? At the end of the day he's just another Hollywood phony.,7,Big Bang Theory,100,20
32760,Amy,7, Is it really worth getting upset about?,7,Big Bang Theory,40,7
32761,Sheldon,7," Yeah, they say don't meet your heroes. Don't peek behind that curtain of fame and celebrity, because if you do, you'll see them as they really are, degenerate carnival folk.",7,Big Bang Theory,174,30
32762,Amy,7," Come on, he's a retired kids show host.",7,Big Bang Theory,40,8
32763,Sheldon,7, That's even worse. Using the sweet candy of science to trick children into loving him. Pervert.,7,Big Bang Theory,96,16
32764,Amy,7, Have you ever thought about why Arthur didn't want you to read his paper?,7,Big Bang Theory,74,14
32765,Sheldon,7," Yes, I have. And my only conclusion is the prescription he was picking up the other day was for cuckoo pills.",7,Big Bang Theory,110,21
32766,Amy,7," Maybe he found you, um, a bit much.",7,Big Bang Theory,36,8
32767,Sheldon,7," That's kind of a stretch. Look, when it comes to social skills, I've mastered the big three. There's the coy smile. There's the friendly chuckle. There's the vocalization of sympathy. Aw. That last one's tricky, I'm still working on it.",7,Big Bang Theory,237,40
32768,Amy,7," From what I saw the other day, I could understand why he and some people might find you",7,Big Bang Theory,88,18
32769,Sheldon,7, What?,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
32770,Amy,7, Doesn't matter.,7,Big Bang Theory,16,2
32771,Sheldon,7," No, go ahead, say it. I know what it is. I've heard it my whole life. The word's annoying. Go ahead, say it. Say it. Say I'm annoying.",7,Big Bang Theory,135,28
32772,Amy,7, Sheldon.,7,Big Bang Theory,9,1
32773,Sheldon,7," Oh, it won't hurt my feelings. Go ahead, Amy, say I'm annoying. I'm annoying. I'm annoying. I'm annoying. Yeah, now, uh, now where are you going? Look, you know you want to say it, say it. Say I'm annoying. Go ahead, say it. Say it. Say it. Amy, say it. Well, she can't stand it when I'm right.",7,Big Bang Theory,295,58
32775,Amy,7, This is fun. I'm going to feel like such a vixen wearing jewellery that doesn't have a list of medications I'm allergic to.,7,Big Bang Theory,124,23
32776,Raj,7," Penny, how's it going over there?",7,Big Bang Theory,34,6
32777,Penny,7," Good, I'm just having little trouble with the glue.",7,Big Bang Theory,52,9
32778,Amy,7, How do you not know how to use glue? Did you ditch pre-school?,7,Big Bang Theory,63,13
32779,Penny,7," Yeah, but only because I was dating a second grader.",7,Big Bang Theory,53,10
32780,Howard,7," Hello, everyone.",7,Big Bang Theory,17,2
32781,Raj,7," Okay, let me have it. Let's hear all the Raj is a girl jokes.",7,Big Bang Theory,62,14
32782,Howard,7, Nope. Bernadette told me it isn't nice and I'm not allowed.,7,Big Bang Theory,60,11
32783,Raj,7, Thank you.,7,Big Bang Theory,11,2
32784,Howard,7," So I won't be making fun of you, or the things you like, or the fact that you just want to have fu-un.",7,Big Bang Theory,103,23
32786,Howard,7," Oh, that's actually pretty nice.",7,Big Bang Theory,33,5
32787,Amy,7, I'm making a bracelet.,7,Big Bang Theory,23,4
32788,Penny,7," Yeah, I'm just making a mess.",7,Big Bang Theory,30,6
32789,Howard,7," You know, instead of beads and glue, you guys can use my soldering iron. You'd be able to make much cooler stuff.",7,Big Bang Theory,114,22
32790,Raj,7," Oh, I think we're doing just fine, thank you.",7,Big Bang Theory,46,9
32791,Amy,7," Actually, I'd kind of like to try that.",7,Big Bang Theory,40,8
32793,Howard,7, Be right back.,7,Big Bang Theory,15,3
32794,Penny,7, When did I have pistachios?,7,Big Bang Theory,28,5
32796,Sheldon,7,  Arthur.  Arthur.  Arthur. Door knocker. That's TV money.,7,Big Bang Theory,58,8
32798,Sheldon,7," I'm sorry, did I wake you?",7,Big Bang Theory,27,6
32800,Sheldon,7," Well, I would have been here sooner, but for some reason your home isn't on this map of Hollywood stars.",7,Big Bang Theory,105,20
32802,Sheldon,7, It's been pointed out by my girlfriend that I may have been annoying to you.,7,Big Bang Theory,77,15
32804,Sheldon,7," Anyway, I wanted to apologize. I am truly sorry.",7,Big Bang Theory,49,9
32806,Sheldon,7," No, no, now that we've cleared the air, I wanted to discuss another matter with you.",7,Big Bang Theory,85,16
32808,Sheldon,7," Well, then, I'll make this quick. Um, I want to talk about the paper you sent Leonard. Now, I know he said it's promising and he's going to collaborate on it, but now that you and I are friends again, I am at your disposal. And, um, frankly, lending my name and reputation to it will help, because a lot of people think that you're a washed-up has-been. Or dead.",7,Big Bang Theory,363,70
32810,Sheldon,7," So, uh, what do you say?",7,Big Bang Theory,25,6
32812,Sheldon,7," It's because I'm annoying, right? I know it is. Say it. Say it. Say I'm annoying. ",7,Big Bang Theory,83,16
32814,Sheldon,7," Say it. Arthur, say it. Say I'm annoying. Say it. Say it. I'm annoying. Say it. ",7,Big Bang Theory,81,16
32816,Sheldon,7," Well, that really hurt. ",7,Big Bang Theory,25,4
32818,Leonard,7," If you would have told me when I was a kid that someday I would be doing science next to Professor Proton, I would not have believed you.",7,Big Bang Theory,138,28
32820,Leonard,7," I'm sorry, Dr. Jeffries, I'm just excited. This nano vacuum tube idea of yours is, it's really interesting.",7,Big Bang Theory,108,18
32821,Sheldon,7," Hello, Leonard. Oh, hello, Arthur. What an odd coincidence that you're both here.",7,Big Bang Theory,82,13
32822,Leonard,7, Why is it odd?,7,Big Bang Theory,15,4
32823,Sheldon,7," Because as it just so happens, I'm also spending the day with a beloved children's television science personality. Isn't that right, new friend and colleague Bill Nye the Science Guy. Sorry, I replaced you with a newer model.",7,Big Bang Theory,226,38
32826,Leonard,7," Mr. Nye, hello. I'm sorry he got you involved in this nonsense.",7,Big Bang Theory,64,12
32828,Sheldon,7," No, I said you were teaching someone a lesson. Now let's go.",7,Big Bang Theory,61,12
32830,Leonard,7," Oh, uh, we're making nano vacuum tubes.",7,Big Bang Theory,40,7
32834,Penny,7," Hey, guys, what do you think?",7,Big Bang Theory,30,6
32835,Amy,7," Wow, Penny, good job.",7,Big Bang Theory,22,4
32836,Penny,7," Thanks. Target, four ninety-nine. I'm getting a drink.",7,Big Bang Theory,55,8
32837,Amy,7, What are you working on?,7,Big Bang Theory,25,5
32838,Raj,7," Ah, I'm making a necklace for my mom. ",7,Big Bang Theory,39,8
32839,Amy,7, That's sweet.,7,Big Bang Theory,14,2
32840,Raj,7," Yeah, she and my dad are going through a bit of a rough patch, so I wanted to do something to let her know I was thinking about her.",7,Big Bang Theory,133,29
32841,Penny,7, What's going on with them?,7,Big Bang Theory,27,5
32842,Raj,7, They're just having a little trouble communicating. My dad says it's because the sound of my mom's voice makes him want to tear his ears off and sew them over his eyes so he never has to look at her again.,7,Big Bang Theory,206,41
32844,Penny,7," Hey, guys.",7,Big Bang Theory,11,2
32845,Amy,7, Hello.,7,Big Bang Theory,7,1
32846,Howard,7, Look who's here to put the Jew in jewellery night.,7,Big Bang Theory,51,10
32848,Howard,7, Sorry we're late. I wanted to swing by the lab and pick up some even cooler tools for us to use.,7,Big Bang Theory,97,21
32849,Raj,7, I didn't know you were coming again.,7,Big Bang Theory,37,7
32850,Howard,7," Well, last week was a blast. Plus, I thought you might like having a guy here. ",7,Big Bang Theory,80,16
32851,Penny,7, It was not funny.,7,Big Bang Theory,18,4
32852,Amy,7," So, what tools did you bring?",7,Big Bang Theory,30,6
32853,Howard,7," Everything we need to make jewellery moulds. Here's some silver, a crucible and an acetylene torch to melt it down.",7,Big Bang Theory,116,20
32854,Penny,7," Ooh, that looks like fun.",7,Big Bang Theory,26,5
32856,Howard,7," Okay, who's up first?",7,Big Bang Theory,22,4
32857,Amy,7," Rajesh, do you want to make a bracelet for your mom to go with the necklace?",7,Big Bang Theory,77,16
32858,Raj,7," No, thanks.",7,Big Bang Theory,12,2
32859,Howard,7," I was gonna make a necklace for my mom, but unfortunately she doesn't have a neck. She's just chins and fat and feet.",7,Big Bang Theory,118,23
32861,Leonard,7," Okay, we're almost ready to go. Once we bond the wires, we can test the tubes.",7,Big Bang Theory,79,16
32863,Leonard,7," Oh, God.",7,Big Bang Theory,9,2
32865,Leonard,7, Sheldon just sent me a picture of him and Bill Nye getting smoothies.,7,Big Bang Theory,70,13
32867,Leonard,7," Yeah, sure.",7,Big Bang Theory,12,2
32869,Leonard,7," Oh, uh, you know, because we're friends.",7,Big Bang Theory,41,7
32871,Leonard,7," Wow, you ask really hard questions.",7,Big Bang Theory,36,6
32873,Leonard,7," Look, I know he can be aggravating, but what you have to remember is that he's not doing it on purpose. It's just how he is. But he's also loyal and trustworthy and we have fun together.",7,Big Bang Theory,187,37
32875,Leonard,7," He did bite me once. But in his defence, I came up behind him while he was eating, so",7,Big Bang Theory,86,19
32877,Leonard,7," You know what, Sheldon is the smartest person I have ever met. And he's a little broken and he needs me. I guess I need him, too.",7,Big Bang Theory,130,27
32879,Leonard,7," Boy, you will not let this go, will you? Oh, jeez.",7,Big Bang Theory,51,11
32881,Leonard,7," No, I have to go pick him up. Bill Nye ditched him at the smoothie place.",7,Big Bang Theory,74,16
32884,Howard,7," You know, if you guys are interested, there's a technique where I can take a lock of your hair, refine it into carbon dust and use the hydraulic press at work to turn it into a tiny little diamond with your DNA in it.",7,Big Bang Theory,218,44
32885,Penny,7," Oh, that's amazing,",7,Big Bang Theory,20,3
32886,Howard,7, Yeah. See Bernie's engagement ring? That came right off my mom's back.,7,Big Bang Theory,71,12
32888,Raj,7, My name is Howard. I can make your hair into diamonds. My mom is morbidly obese. Everybody love me.,7,Big Bang Theory,100,19
32889,Howard,7," Whoa, where is that coming from?",7,Big Bang Theory,33,6
32890,Raj,7, I'll tell you where it's coming from. All you do is make fun of me for coming to girls' night and now you're here ruining it for everyone.,7,Big Bang Theory,139,28
32891,Penny,7," Raj, cool it, he's gonna make us hair diamonds.",7,Big Bang Theory,48,9
32892,Howard,7, How am I ruining anything? I'm just trying to help you make better jewellery.,7,Big Bang Theory,78,14
32893,Raj,7, But this isn't about the jewellery. This is about me having a place where I can open up about my feelings.,7,Big Bang Theory,107,21
32894,Howard,7, Since when can't you open up with me?,7,Big Bang Theory,38,8
32895,Raj,7," There are just some things that I feel more comfortable sharing with the girls, because they won't make fun of me or and call me names, or ask me if my Koothrapanties are in a bunch.",7,Big Bang Theory,183,36
32896,Howard,7," Buddy, I was just joking around. ",7,Big Bang Theory,34,6
32897,Raj,7," Yeah, well, sometimes your jokes hurt. ",7,Big Bang Theory,40,6
32898,Howard,7, You're right. I didn't realize I was making you feel that way. It was very brave of you to tell me.,7,Big Bang Theory,100,21
32899,Raj,7, Thank you. It wasn't easy.,7,Big Bang Theory,27,5
32900,Amy,7," They're gonna have sex before Sheldon and I do, I know it.",7,Big Bang Theory,59,12
32902,Sheldon,7, Arthur?,7,Big Bang Theory,8,1
32904,Sheldon,7, I'm surprised to see you here.,7,Big Bang Theory,31,6
32906,Sheldon,7, I'll get Leonard.,7,Big Bang Theory,18,3
32908,Sheldon,7," If you're hoping to get in touch with Bill Nye, I can't help you. I've been informed that he's now Bill Nye the Restraining Order Guy.",7,Big Bang Theory,135,26
32910,Sheldon,7, Thank you. It would be an honour.,7,Big Bang Theory,34,7
32912,Sheldon,7," Actually, I don't need that. I hacked into your e-mail account and read it.",7,Big Bang Theory,76,14
32914,Sheldon,7," Well, first, I think the fact that you use your birthday as a password is embarrassing. ",7,Big Bang Theory,89,16
32916,Sheldon,7," Second, um, I thought your paper was inspired. ",7,Big Bang Theory,48,8
32918,Sheldon,7, Can I invite you in for tea?,7,Big Bang Theory,29,7
32920,Penny,7," Hey, Arthur. How are you?",7,Big Bang Theory,26,5
32923,Howard,7," Oh, hey, buddy, what's up?",7,Big Bang Theory,27,5
32924,Raj,7," Well, I was feeling bad about how I acted the other night so I made you a little something.",7,Big Bang Theory,92,19
32925,Howard,7, You didn't have to do that.,7,Big Bang Theory,28,6
32926,Raj,7," Well, it was fun. I used some of the jewellery techniques you taught us. It's a lightsabre belt buckle.",7,Big Bang Theory,104,19
32927,Howard,7," Wow, this is so cool. Thanks.",7,Big Bang Theory,30,6
32928,Raj,7, Oh gets better.,7,Big Bang Theory,16,3
32929,Howard,7, Wow.,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
32930,Raj,7," And that's not even the best part. See? I have one, too. Check it out. You can wear yours and we can have little sword fights whenever we want.",7,Big Bang Theory,144,29
32932,Sheldon,7," Yeah, and my eighth favourite episode of Professor Proton was Alka-Seltzer rocket. You said, plop, plop, fizz, fizz, oh, what a blast-off it is. Remember? Remember that? Remember?",7,Big Bang Theory,180,28
32933,Leonard,7, He can't help it. He can't. He really can't.,7,Big Bang Theory,45,9
32934,Sheldon,7," Oh, wait here. I'll get some Alka-Seltzer, we can build that rocket, and we can shoot it at Bill Nye's house. As long as I'm not within 500 feet of it.",7,Big Bang Theory,152,31
32936,Penny,7," Sorry, they're both married.",7,Big Bang Theory,29,4
32938,Penny,7, Mmm.,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
32941,Penny,8," Hey, can I ask you a question?",7,Big Bang Theory,31,7
32942,Leonard,8, Sure.,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
32943,Penny,8," You've had this dart board since I've known you, but I've never seen you play.",7,Big Bang Theory,79,15
32944,Leonard,8," Oh, uh, we played, once. I broke a window.",7,Big Bang Theory,43,9
32945,Penny,8, What window?,7,Big Bang Theory,13,2
32946,Leonard,8, That one over there.,7,Big Bang Theory,21,4
32947,Sheldon,8," Leonard, where are the Skee-Ball tickets?",7,Big Bang Theory,42,6
32948,Leonard,8, Skee-Ball tickets?,7,Big Bang Theory,19,2
32949,Sheldon,8," Yeah, from when we went to the arcade three years ago? I finally decided what prize I want. Hurry up.",7,Big Bang Theory,102,20
32950,Leonard,8," Uh, if I still have them, they're probably in the junk box.",7,Big Bang Theory,60,12
32951,Penny,8," Ooh, what are you gonna get?",7,Big Bang Theory,29,6
32952,Sheldon,8," None of your business. But when you see me wearing a flower in my lapel later, you are most welcome to sniff it.",7,Big Bang Theory,113,23
32953,Leonard,8," Yup, oh, here you go.",7,Big Bang Theory,22,5
32954,Sheldon,8," Oh, thank you. Here, get yourself an eraser for your troubles.",7,Big Bang Theory,63,11
32955,Leonard,8, Oh. I forgot about this. My aunt made it for me when I started college.,7,Big Bang Theory,72,15
32956,Penny,8," Aw, did she hate you?",7,Big Bang Theory,22,5
32957,Leonard,8," Why? Because I got an ugly, itchy sweater, and my brother got a car? No, I was her favorite.",7,Big Bang Theory,93,19
32958,Sheldon,8, I seem to be a few tickets short. Are there more in the box?,7,Big Bang Theory,61,14
32959,Leonard,8," Hmm, I think I got them all. Nope, they're not in there.",7,Big Bang Theory,57,12
32960,Sheldon,8," Well, you barely looked. Let me see.",7,Big Bang Theory,37,7
32961,Leonard,8," No, no, no, I, I looked, and there's, there's, there's no more tickets.",7,Big Bang Theory,72,13
32962,Sheldon,8," Leonard, let me look in the box.",7,Big Bang Theory,33,7
32963,Leonard,8," Okay, okay. I'm gonna show you what's in the box. But just promise not to flip out.",7,Big Bang Theory,84,17
32964,Sheldon,8, Why would I flip out? Is it a spider? It's a spider.,7,Big Bang Theory,53,12
32965,Penny,8," No, if it was a spider, Lenny would've flipped out.",7,Big Bang Theory,52,10
32966,Leonard,8," Okay, Sheldon, I know I was supposed to return this DVD a long time ago, and I know we rented it on your card. But it's been, like, seven years and clearly nothing bad has happened. So in-in-in-instead of being a giant pain in the ass like you always are, what if this one time you just tried staying calm?",7,Big Bang Theory,307,60
32967,Sheldon,8," That seems like a reasonable request. Although so did, hey, Leonard, would you mind returning that DVD?",7,Big Bang Theory,104,17
32968,Leonard,8," I'm sorry. I'll, I'll take care of it.",7,Big Bang Theory,39,8
32969,Sheldon,8, Okay.,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
32970,Leonard,8," I mean it, I'm going to.",7,Big Bang Theory,25,6
32971,Sheldon,8, I believe you.,7,Big Bang Theory,15,3
32972,Leonard,8, And you're going to stay calm?,7,Big Bang Theory,31,6
32973,Sheldon,8, I said I would.,7,Big Bang Theory,16,4
32974,Leonard,8, How about that? Sheldon's being reasonable.,7,Big Bang Theory,44,6
32975,Penny,8," Yeah, it's freaking me out. I'm gonna go.",7,Big Bang Theory,42,8
32977,Leonard,8," So, when you say you're not going to freak out about the DVD, here's what that means. Don't fixate on it. Don't wake me up in the middle of the night. Or nag me through the door while I'm on the toilet.",7,Big Bang Theory,203,42
32978,Sheldon,8," Okay, first, talking to you while you're on the toilet isn't exactly a picnic for me either, okay? Remember, when you can hear me, I can hear you. And second, you completely disregard how uncomfortable unresolved issues are for me. It's, it's like, a, an itch in my brain I can't scratch.",7,Big Bang Theory,289,52
32979,Leonard,8, When I broke my arm I used to stick a coat hanger down there. You ever try that? Maybe go in through the ear?,7,Big Bang Theory,110,24
32980,Sheldon,8, You wouldn't make jokes if you could feel the way I feel.,7,Big Bang Theory,58,12
32981,Leonard,8," Well, I don't know how to do that.",7,Big Bang Theory,35,8
32982,Sheldon,8," How about this? I promise I won't pester you about the DVD. You can defecate in peace. That's a win for both of us. But, until this matter is resolved, I would like you to wear this sweater. With nothing underneath it.",7,Big Bang Theory,219,42
32983,Leonard,8, That's stupid. Why?,7,Big Bang Theory,20,3
32984,Sheldon,8, You say it's itchy and uncomfortable. I say situations like this make me feel the same way. ,7,Big Bang Theory,93,17
32985,Leonard,8," I'm telling you, try the hanger.",7,Big Bang Theory,33,6
32986,Sheldon,8, Put it on. Let's share the experience.,7,Big Bang Theory,39,7
32987,Leonard,8," You got it. If this sweater shuts you up, I'm gonna make a fortune selling them to everyone we know. Now all I need to do is head down to the video store and return the DVD.",7,Big Bang Theory,174,37
32988,Sheldon,8," Oh, did I forget to tell you? That store went out of business years ago.",7,Big Bang Theory,73,15
32989,Leonard,8, Really?,7,Big Bang Theory,8,1
32990,Sheldon,8," How those nipples feeling, chief?",7,Big Bang Theory,34,5
32993,Penny,8," Yeah, hang on, just give me sec.",7,Big Bang Theory,33,7
32994,Amy,8," At work today, I did an in vivo stereotaxic surgery.",7,Big Bang Theory,53,10
32996,Penny,8, I scraped gum off the bottom of that table. Only 'cause my manager saw me put it there.,7,Big Bang Theory,88,18
32997,Amy,8," Oh, my gosh. That's the girl that broke Rajesh's heart.",7,Big Bang Theory,56,10
32999,Penny,8, I don't know why but I always pictured her as Indian.,7,Big Bang Theory,54,11
33001,Penny,8, I'm gonna go talk to her.,7,Big Bang Theory,26,6
33003,Penny,8, I'm not gonna say anything. I just want to check her out. Because she hurt my friend. My Indian friend. Who's racist now?,7,Big Bang Theory,122,23
33005,Penny,8," Yeah, well, you're short.",7,Big Bang Theory,26,4
33006,Amy,8, We're never getting our drinks.,7,Big Bang Theory,32,5
33008,Penny,8," Hey, can I start you off with something to drink?",7,Big Bang Theory,50,10
33010,Penny,8," Okay. Um, you're Lucy, right? I'm a friend of Raj Koothrappali's. Actually Amy recognized you.",7,Big Bang Theory,95,15
33012,Penny,8," Oh, you know, he's good.",7,Big Bang Theory,25,5
33014,Penny,8," Yeah, this is none of my business. But why did you break up with him in an e-mail?",7,Big Bang Theory,83,18
33016,Penny,8," Yeah, I get that. I'll go get you your water. When you say easier, you mean easier for you, right? â€˜Cause it certainly didn't make it easier for him.",7,Big Bang Theory,152,29
33018,Penny,8," I'm sorry, this is rude of me. I will go get that water. See, see, see, see. Just now you expressed your feelings to my face. How come you could do that with me, but not Raj?",7,Big Bang Theory,175,37
33020,Penny,8," You know what the worst part is? You're sitting here, perfectly happy and he's at home, a blubbering mess.",7,Big Bang Theory,107,19
33022,Penny,8," Well, I also said I was getting you water, but look at me still standing here. You know, I may be a bad waitress, but you are a bad person. Now, you want to hear the specials?",7,Big Bang Theory,176,37
33024,Howard,8," So, you can never take it off?",7,Big Bang Theory,31,7
33025,Leonard,8, No.,7,Big Bang Theory,4,1
33026,Raj,8, Not even to sleep?,7,Big Bang Theory,19,4
33027,Leonard,8, No.,7,Big Bang Theory,4,1
33028,Howard,8," So, you're just an idiot?",7,Big Bang Theory,26,5
33029,Leonard,8, It's called proving a point.,7,Big Bang Theory,29,5
33030,Howard,8, Is the point that you're an idiot?,7,Big Bang Theory,35,7
33031,Sheldon,8," Gentlemen, please. Leonard is trying to walk a mile in my metaphorical shoes. He can't walk in my actual shoes. He has the feet of a toddler.",7,Big Bang Theory,142,27
33032,Raj,8," So, how are you gonna return the DVD if the store went out of business?",7,Big Bang Theory,72,15
33033,Leonard,8," Monday morning I'll go downtown, look up the owner's information and send him the DVD. Pay the late fee, and prove to Sheldon that you can have a problem and solve it without acting like a complete lunatic. Ah!",7,Big Bang Theory,211,39
33034,Howard,8, And the man impersonating a bear would like everyone to know that only you can prevent forest fires.,7,Big Bang Theory,101,18
33035,Raj,8, I don't get it.,7,Big Bang Theory,16,4
33036,Howard,8, You didn't have Smokey the Bear in India?,7,Big Bang Theory,42,8
33037,Raj,8," No. Oh, is he anything like, uh, Mun-Mun the Mongoose? He taught us not to play with cobras.",7,Big Bang Theory,93,18
33038,Howard,8, You had to be taught not to play with cobras?,7,Big Bang Theory,46,10
33039,Raj,8, You had to be taught not to burn down the forest?,7,Big Bang Theory,50,11
33041,Penny,8," Hey, if you guys were hungry, why didn't you order something at the restaurant?",7,Big Bang Theory,80,14
33043,Penny,8," Oh, that's right. Nachos and a turkey club.",7,Big Bang Theory,44,8
33044,Amy,8, Not even close.,7,Big Bang Theory,16,3
33045,Penny,8," Well, I was too busy standing up for my friend to worry about your, I want to say salmon.",7,Big Bang Theory,90,19
33046,Amy,8, You want to say sorry.,7,Big Bang Theory,23,5
33048,Penny,8, What do you mean how? What's the big deal?,7,Big Bang Theory,43,9
33049,Amy,8, You told Lucy he was a pathetic mess.,7,Big Bang Theory,38,8
33051,Penny,8," Okay, you guys are overreacting. Raj is gonna appreciate how I had his back.",7,Big Bang Theory,77,14
33053,Raj,8," What is wrong with you, Penny? You ruined any chance I had of getting back with Lucy. Now she knows I'm a desperate mess instead of just being pretty sure.  It's Lucy. She wants to meet for coffee. I love you, Penny.",7,Big Bang Theory,217,42
33055,Howard,8," Hey, what're you working on?",7,Big Bang Theory,29,5
33056,Sheldon,8, I'm thinking about how one could use the fact that a rapidly rotating mirror turns virtual photons into real ones as a method of observing dark energy.,7,Big Bang Theory,152,27
33057,Howard,8, That's a pretty cool idea.,7,Big Bang Theory,27,5
33058,Sheldon,8, Yeah. It's great you're here. I'd love to get an engineer's opinion.,7,Big Bang Theory,69,12
33059,Howard,8, Sure.,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
33060,Sheldon,8," This chair is squeaky. Now, do I fix it or get a new one?",7,Big Bang Theory,58,14
33061,Leonard,8," Well, Sheldon, it took me all morning, but I found the owner of the video store. And I am happy to report that he died peacefully in his sleep, drunk at the bottom of a pool. Anyway, there is no one to return the DVD to, so this issue is resolved. Ah! And I'd just like to point out that even though the sweater was uncomfortable, I didn't use it as an excuse to antagonize everyone around me.",7,Big Bang Theory,394,78
33062,Howard,8," You know, you could reimburse the video store owner's next of kin.",7,Big Bang Theory,67,12
33063,Leonard,8, Or it's resolved.,7,Big Bang Theory,18,3
33064,Sheldon,8," Hey, that next of kin thing sounds pretty good.",7,Big Bang Theory,48,9
33065,Howard,8, I believe this is yours.,7,Big Bang Theory,25,5
33067,Raj,8," Can I ask you guys a question? So, I'm seeing Lucy tomorrow night, and I've never hung out with someone who broke up with me. How do you do it?",7,Big Bang Theory,144,30
33068,Howard,8," You can't let her know you're hurting. You know, the key is confidence.",7,Big Bang Theory,72,13
33069,Raj,8, Why is the key always confidence? How come it's never love handles and flop sweat?,7,Big Bang Theory,83,15
33071,Howard,8," Well, if I may, he has so little self-respect and is so desperate for the smallest crumb of affection, she could literally sleep with his own father in his own bed and post the video to YouTube, and he'd still buy her flowers and ask her to be his bride.",7,Big Bang Theory,255,50
33072,Raj,8," He's right. But in my defence, if we could survive that, we could survive anything.",7,Big Bang Theory,84,15
33074,Raj,8," Well, can I say she looks nice?",7,Big Bang Theory,32,7
33076,Raj,8, Can I tell her I miss her?,7,Big Bang Theory,27,7
33078,Raj,8," Oh, can I show her an oil painting I made of us surrounded by our children and grandchildren?",7,Big Bang Theory,94,18
33080,Raj,8," Good, good. â€˜Cause no matter how hard I try, I cannot get the twins to look alike.",7,Big Bang Theory,85,17
33082,Penny,8, What are you doing?,7,Big Bang Theory,20,4
33083,Leonard,8," Oh, I'm just trying to find the stupid next of kin to this stupid video store owner so I can return the DVD and see the look on Sheldon's stupid face when he sees that I didn't let this get to me.",7,Big Bang Theory,197,42
33084,Penny,8, Sheldon's not here. Why don't you take the sweater off?,7,Big Bang Theory,56,10
33085,Leonard,8, There's a principle at stake.,7,Big Bang Theory,30,5
33086,Penny,8, Which is?,7,Big Bang Theory,10,2
33087,Leonard,8," Oh, I don't know. Who cares? Look at me.",7,Big Bang Theory,41,9
33088,Penny,8," Oh, my God! Is that sweater made of bees? Come on, take it off. I won't tell.",7,Big Bang Theory,78,17
33089,Leonard,8," No, no, honey, if I take it off, Sheldon wins.",7,Big Bang Theory,47,10
33090,Penny,8," Sweetie, every night you don't kill him in his sleep, he wins.",7,Big Bang Theory,63,12
33091,Leonard,8," No, it's, it's almost done. I just, I have to find the next of kin, and send 'em the DVD and then just wait for someone with my complexion to die so I can get a skin graft.",7,Big Bang Theory,173,38
33092,Penny,8, Smile.,7,Big Bang Theory,7,1
33093,Leonard,8, What is that? What is that for?,7,Big Bang Theory,32,7
33094,Penny,8, So you can send it to Princeton and get your money back.,7,Big Bang Theory,57,12
33096,Amy,8," I must say, Sheldon, you're handling this DVD business with an impressive amount of maturity.",7,Big Bang Theory,94,15
33097,Sheldon,8, I don't know why that surprises you. I'm a grown man. As should be evident by this sport coat and very real flower in my lapel.,7,Big Bang Theory,128,26
33098,Amy,8, Is there some kind of new coping mechanism you're employing?,7,Big Bang Theory,61,10
33099,Sheldon,8," The more interesting question you should be asking is, what does this flower smell like?",7,Big Bang Theory,89,15
33100,Amy,8, I'm gonna go with sad. So what's the story with you and this DVD?,7,Big Bang Theory,66,14
33101,Sheldon,8," There's nothing to tell. Maybe I purchased a book entitled Don't Sweat the Small Stuff and I followed its wise suggestions, one of which was stop and smell the flowers.",7,Big Bang Theory,169,30
33102,Amy,8, Seriously?,7,Big Bang Theory,11,1
33103,Sheldon,8," Please. Ha-ha, Oh.",7,Big Bang Theory,19,3
33106,Raj,8," Hello. Oh, it's so good to see you.",7,Big Bang Theory,36,8
33108,Raj,8," Please, sit. I, uh, I got you a cappuccino. I remembered it was your favourite. I also got crumb cake, but I remembered it was my favourite and I ate it. Anyway, uh, how are you?",7,Big Bang Theory,179,36
33110,Raj,8," Well, and I ate all the crumb cake. We both made mistakes.",7,Big Bang Theory,59,12
33112,Raj,8," I'm so happy you asked me here, and I hope we can hang out again sometime. You know, as friends, lovemaking partners, whatever.",7,Big Bang Theory,128,23
33114,Raj,8," I think I know the answer to this, but just to be clear, it's not me, right?",7,Big Bang Theory,77,17
33116,Raj,8," This is all your fault, I should've listened to Mun-Mun because I've been playing with a cobra and her name is Penny. Why are you so cruel? Do you enjoy my pain?",7,Big Bang Theory,162,32
33117,Penny,8, There's a girl at the Cheesecake Factory I can set you up with.,7,Big Bang Theory,64,13
33118,Raj,8," I love you, Penny.",7,Big Bang Theory,19,4
33120,Sheldon,8, How is it I can conceptualize a methodology of examining dark matter in the universe but can't figure out how to fix a novelty squirt flower?,7,Big Bang Theory,142,26
33121,Amy,8," I think the real question is, why do you waste your time with cheap, childish pranks?",7,Big Bang Theory,86,16
33122,Sheldon,8, There's probably a deep reason. Which I'd be happy to discuss with you over some peanut brittle in a can.,7,Big Bang Theory,106,20
33123,Leonard,8," Okay, Sheldon, I am out of options. Video store owner, Nursis Manookian, has no next of kin.",7,Big Bang Theory,93,17
33124,Sheldon,8," Well, you seem hot under the collar, or is that the sweater?",7,Big Bang Theory,61,12
33125,Leonard,8," Oh, oh, no, no. It's because I spent all afternoon at the Armenian church where his funeral mass was held. According to Father Solakian, no one attended. Luckily, my trip wasn't a complete waste. I lit a candle and prayed for your death but I'm not Armenian, so it probably won't work. This is over, right?",7,Big Bang Theory,307,56
33126,Sheldon,8," Oh, not necessarily. I suggest you look for long-lost relatives either in Armenia or Lebanon.",7,Big Bang Theory,94,15
33127,Leonard,8," Listen to me, Sheldon. I am not going to Lebanon to return Super Mario Brothers the movie.",7,Big Bang Theory,91,17
33128,Sheldon,8," You know, it might be fun. You love hummus.",7,Big Bang Theory,44,9
33129,Leonard,8, Why isn't this bothering you? Isn't your brain getting itchy? This is on your card. This could be ruining your credit score. Why isn't this making you crazy?,7,Big Bang Theory,158,28
33130,Sheldon,8," Leonard, I have something to tell you, but I want you to promise not to flip out.",7,Big Bang Theory,82,17
33131,Leonard,8, What?,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
33132,Sheldon,8," Seven years ago, I found out the DVD was late and I paid for it.",7,Big Bang Theory,65,15
33133,Leonard,8, What?,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
33134,Sheldon,8," I was going to mention it at the time, but then I thought, some day, this might be a teachable moment.",7,Big Bang Theory,103,21
33135,Leonard,8," Aaaah! I, you, how can, what!",7,Big Bang Theory,30,6
33136,Amy,8," Sheldon, that was diabolical.",7,Big Bang Theory,30,4
33137,Sheldon,8, I know. And it wasn't easy. Do you have any idea what it's like to wait for years and never know if you're going to finally get satisfaction?,7,Big Bang Theory,142,28
33139,Raj,8, Wow. You're even prettier than Penny said. I can't believe a girl like you doesn't have a boyfriend.,7,Big Bang Theory,101,18
33141,Raj,8," I don't believe you, you're lying to me. ",7,Big Bang Theory,42,8
33143,Raj,8," Oh, it's okay. I have no morals and I'm desperately lonely. I'll be the other man if you want a little something-something on the side.",7,Big Bang Theory,136,25
33147,Penny,8, What is wrong with you?,7,Big Bang Theory,24,5
33149,Raj,8, What is wrong with you?,7,Big Bang Theory,24,5
33151,Leonard,9, The math is all there. It's not real.,7,Big Bang Theory,38,8
33152,Penny,9," Yes, it is.",7,Big Bang Theory,12,3
33153,Sheldon,9," Yeah,uh, look, it is scientifically impossible for a person to tip a cow. Even you, with your stocky build and lumberjack shoulders, you couldn't do it.",7,Big Bang Theory,153,26
33154,Raj,9, It's horrible. Why would you push a cow over? They're sacred.,7,Big Bang Theory,62,11
33155,Penny,9," Oh, stop it. I've seen you eat, like, a million hamburgers.",7,Big Bang Theory,60,11
33156,Raj,9," Hey, an animal can be both sacred and delicious.",7,Big Bang Theory,49,9
33157,Penny,9," Look, I'm telling you I've done it, okay? I clearly remember the cow standing up and then the cow on its side.",7,Big Bang Theory,111,22
33158,Leonard,9, Were you drunk?,7,Big Bang Theory,16,3
33159,Penny,9, I was 16 in Nebraska. What do you think?,7,Big Bang Theory,41,9
33160,Leonard,9, I think you're the one who fell over.,7,Big Bang Theory,38,8
33161,Penny,9, That would explain why the sky was also on its side.,7,Big Bang Theory,53,11
33162,Howard,9, Hey.,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
33163,Penny,9, Howard. Cow tipping. Real or not?,7,Big Bang Theory,34,6
33164,Howard,9," Mmm. I'm gonna say not. That's just based on me trying to roll my mom over when she's snoring. Speaking of that big side of beef, uh, she's invited all of you to Thanksgiving at her house.",7,Big Bang Theory,189,37
33165,Sheldon,9," Mmm. You know, I've been told that a bald refusal of an invitation is rude and one must instead offer up a polite excuse, so I'd love to go, but, unfortunately, that sounds awful.",7,Big Bang Theory,180,34
33166,Howard,9," Come on, it'll be fun.",7,Big Bang Theory,23,5
33167,Penny,9," Uh, we were actually gonna do it here.",7,Big Bang Theory,39,8
33168,Howard,9," Please? Bernadette's bringing her dad 'cause her mom's out of town, and I never have anything to say to that guy.",7,Big Bang Theory,114,21
33169,Sheldon,9," Oh, since you put it that way, I'd love to go, but that sounds even more awful.",7,Big Bang Theory,80,17
33170,Leonard,9, It'd actually be nice to not hear Sheldon complain about my cooking all day.,7,Big Bang Theory,77,14
33171,Sheldon,9," Uh, excuse me, but every year you prepare a terrible meal and every year I criticize it. Do our traditions mean nothing to you?",7,Big Bang Theory,128,24
33172,Leonard,9, I want to go.,7,Big Bang Theory,14,4
33173,Penny,9," Yeah, me, too.",7,Big Bang Theory,15,3
33174,Raj,9, I'm in.,7,Big Bang Theory,8,2
33175,Howard,9, Sheldon.,7,Big Bang Theory,9,1
33176,Sheldon,9," Ugh, fine, I'll go. But if her food is delicious, Thanksgiving is ruined, and it's on you.",7,Big Bang Theory,91,17
33178,Sheldon,9, Do we really have to go to Mrs. Wolowitz's house?,7,Big Bang Theory,50,10
33179,Amy,9, We do. And I expect you to be on your best behaviour.,7,Big Bang Theory,54,12
33180,Sheldon,9, Now I know how the African slaves felt. Being dragged from their homes to labour under the yoke of the white man.,7,Big Bang Theory,114,22
33181,Amy,9, Are you honestly comparing Thanksgiving dinner at Wolowitz's mom's with one of the greatest tragedies in the history of mankind?,7,Big Bang Theory,129,20
33182,Sheldon,9, Yes.,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
33183,Penny,9," Sheldon, you can have a nice Thanksgiving anywhere. I spent one in Vegas.",7,Big Bang Theory,74,13
33184,Leonard,9, You did?,7,Big Bang Theory,9,2
33185,Penny,9," Yeah, back when I was dating Zack. It was actually more fun than I thought. We gambled, we went to one of those cheesy wedding chapels, we had a really good turkey dinner. Which was surprising, since we were at a strip club.",7,Big Bang Theory,225,43
33186,Leonard,9," Wait, you went to a chapel?",7,Big Bang Theory,28,6
33187,Penny,9, Yeah. ,7,Big Bang Theory,7,1
33188,Leonard,9, Why? ,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
33189,Penny,9, We had one of those silly fake weddings.,7,Big Bang Theory,41,8
33190,Leonard,9," Penny, you know those are real, right?",7,Big Bang Theory,39,7
33191,Penny,9," No, they're not.",7,Big Bang Theory,17,3
33192,Leonard,9," Yeah, they are.",7,Big Bang Theory,16,3
33193,Penny,9," No, they're not.",7,Big Bang Theory,17,3
33194,Leonard,9," Yeah, they are.",7,Big Bang Theory,16,3
33195,Sheldon,9, He's right.,7,Big Bang Theory,12,2
33196,Amy,9, They're real.,7,Big Bang Theory,14,2
33197,Penny,9, But it didn't seem real.,7,Big Bang Theory,25,5
33198,Sheldon,9," Let me ask you a question. At any point, was Las Vegas on its side?",7,Big Bang Theory,68,15
33206,Howard,9," You just took it. At least let it reach your first stomach.  Hey, Mike. Let me help you out, there.",7,Big Bang Theory,100,20
33208,Howard,9," Oh, her gout's flaring up. Turns out an apple pie a day does not keep the doctor away.",7,Big Bang Theory,87,18
33210,Howard,9," Maybe because that little piggy is being crushed by the barn. She should quiet down soon. I gave her enough pain meds to choke a, well, her.",7,Big Bang Theory,141,27
33212,Howard,9, I have a better idea.,7,Big Bang Theory,22,5
33214,Howard,9, I was gonna make Raj do it all by himself.,7,Big Bang Theory,43,10
33217,Amy,9," No traffic, we're sailing.",7,Big Bang Theory,27,4
33218,Sheldon,9, Yes. Like we're on a ship. Coming from Africa to America.,7,Big Bang Theory,58,11
33219,Amy,9," Sheldon, that's completely inappropriate. You can't keep comparing yourself to a slave.",7,Big Bang Theory,88,12
33220,Sheldon,9," Yes, Miss Amy.",7,Big Bang Theory,15,3
33221,Leonard,9, I can't believe you're married to that idiot.,7,Big Bang Theory,46,8
33222,Penny,9," Ugh, would you stop? We just did it as a goof.",7,Big Bang Theory,47,11
33223,Leonard,9," Well, a goof or not, you're actually married. You need to get this taken care of.",7,Big Bang Theory,82,16
33224,Penny,9, I will. Why are you making this such a big deal?,7,Big Bang Theory,49,11
33225,Sheldon,9," Oh, oh, oh, I have a reason. It could be because you said yes to marrying Zack, but every time Leonard's proposed, he's gotten a resounding no. Yeah, that's just off the top of my head.",7,Big Bang Theory,186,36
33226,Penny,9, So how do I undo this?,7,Big Bang Theory,23,6
33227,Leonard,9, I'm hoping you can get an annulment. It's just like it never happened.,7,Big Bang Theory,71,13
33228,Penny,9," Great, well, what do I have to do?",7,Big Bang Theory,35,8
33229,Amy,9, It says here you can get an annulment if any of the following conditions are met. Were you unable to consummate the marriage?,7,Big Bang Theory,126,23
33230,Sheldon,9, Hah!Penny? Next.,7,Big Bang Theory,17,2
33231,Amy,9," Is there any evidence of fraud, bigamy, want of understanding?",7,Big Bang Theory,63,10
33232,Penny,9, Want of understanding? What does that even mean?,7,Big Bang Theory,49,8
33233,Amy,9," Ding, ding, ding. We have a winner.",7,Big Bang Theory,36,7
33236,Raj,9," Ah, no problem. It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without an Indian providing the food. Uh, now, where does your mom keep the Crisco?",7,Big Bang Theory,128,22
33237,Howard,9," Um, I don't know. Probably in a wad in her cheek.",7,Big Bang Theory,50,11
33239,Howard,9, He doesn't want me in there. I'm the creepy little guy who has sex with his daughter.,7,Big Bang Theory,86,17
33241,Howard,9, Does he?,7,Big Bang Theory,9,2
33243,Howard,9, Really?,7,Big Bang Theory,8,1
33246,Howard,9, So your wife's in Arizona with the grandkids?,7,Big Bang Theory,46,8
33248,Howard,9," You know, my mom's been to Arizona. She rode one of those mules down in the Grand Canyon. Long story short, they had to shoot it. â€˜Cause she's so fat. I'll get the door while you finish laughing. Hey, guys.",7,Big Bang Theory,209,40
33249,Amy,9, Happy Thanksgiving.,7,Big Bang Theory,20,2
33250,Sheldon,9," It smells wonderful. Is anyone slaving away in the kitchen? Because I, too, know",7,Big Bang Theory,81,14
33251,Amy,9, Sheldon.,7,Big Bang Theory,9,1
33252,Penny,9, Here. Thank you for having us.,7,Big Bang Theory,31,6
33253,Howard,9, What's with you?,7,Big Bang Theory,17,3
33254,Leonard,9," Oh, she's mad at me because she just found out she's married to Zack.",7,Big Bang Theory,70,14
33255,Howard,9, Really? That dumb-ass she used to date? That's hysterical.,7,Big Bang Theory,59,9
33256,Penny,9, I can't believe I felt bad for opening this in the car.,7,Big Bang Theory,56,12
33258,Amy,9, You need any help?,7,Big Bang Theory,19,4
33259,Raj,9," Uh, yeah, can you, uh, reach that, uh, gravy boat up there?",7,Big Bang Theory,60,12
33260,Amy,9," Uh, sure.",7,Big Bang Theory,10,2
33261,Raj,9," Great. That makes one of you. Okay, we have a lot to do and not much time to do it. Bernadette, you're on corn, gravy and yam detail. Amy, you're on rolls, cranberries and making sure Bernadette stays away from the marshmallows. That's right, I see you. Okay, if you have any questions, I'll be over here basting my ass off. Focus is key.",7,Big Bang Theory,339,64
33262,Amy,9, Did you guys know Penny married Zack three years ago?,7,Big Bang Theory,54,10
33265,Howard,9, You ever play football?,7,Big Bang Theory,24,4
33267,Howard,9, No. But I did get tackled in the hallway once. The whole school cheered.,7,Big Bang Theory,73,14
33268,Leonard,9," Okay, I found the, uh, court papers that you and Zack need to fill out. I'll print them when we get home.",7,Big Bang Theory,106,22
33269,Penny,9, Fine.,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
33270,Leonard,9, And we can just put this whole thing behind us.,7,Big Bang Theory,48,10
33271,Penny,9, Are you done?,7,Big Bang Theory,14,3
33272,Leonard,9, What?,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
33273,Penny,9," Look, I get it, I screwed up. Is this all we're gonna talk about the rest of the day?",7,Big Bang Theory,86,19
33274,Leonard,9, Why are you mad at me? You're the one that did the stupid thing. I'm just trying to fix it.,7,Big Bang Theory,92,20
33275,Penny,9," Ugh, I need some air.",7,Big Bang Theory,22,5
33276,Leonard,9," Wuh, Penny.",7,Big Bang Theory,12,2
33277,Sheldon,9," I don't know the first thing about women, but I would not follow her.",7,Big Bang Theory,70,14
33279,Leonard,9, How am I the bad guy? She's the one who married someone else. I'm the victim.,7,Big Bang Theory,78,16
33280,Howard,9, Sounds like Zack's the victim. You're sleeping with his wife.,7,Big Bang Theory,62,10
33282,Leonard,9, Sure.,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
33284,Sheldon,9, They passed against a nickel defence. They should have run it off-tackle.,7,Big Bang Theory,74,12
33286,Sheldon,9, My father loved football. He always made me watch it before I was allowed to do my homework.,7,Big Bang Theory,93,18
33287,Penny,9," Well, you'll be happy to know I just spoke to Zack and he's willing to sign the court papers. He's on his way here now.",7,Big Bang Theory,120,25
33288,Leonard,9," Wait, you invited him here?",7,Big Bang Theory,28,5
33289,Penny,9, Yeah. ,7,Big Bang Theory,7,1
33291,Leonard,9, Come on.,7,Big Bang Theory,9,2
33293,Sheldon,9," I would throw a quick slant to a wideout, given that the defence is showing blitz.",7,Big Bang Theory,83,16
33294,Howard,9," Oh, I love a good blitz, especially with sour cream. Get it? â€˜Cause it sounds like blintz.",7,Big Bang Theory,93,17
33297,Leonard,9, I just don't understand why you invited him here today.,7,Big Bang Theory,56,10
33298,Penny,9," Because you wouldn't shut up about it. When I called him, he had nothing to do, so I just thought it would",7,Big Bang Theory,107,22
33299,Raj,9," Hey, guys, I'm trying to cook in here.",7,Big Bang Theory,39,8
33300,Penny,9," Oh, sorry. We'll keep it down.",7,Big Bang Theory,31,6
33301,Raj,9," No, no, speak up. I'm about to use the blender, and I don't want to miss anything.",7,Big Bang Theory,83,17
33302,Leonard,9," Well, you might have to cook for one more because she invited Zack.",7,Big Bang Theory,68,13
33304,Amy,9, Ooh!,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
33305,Raj,9," My, my. The plot, like my gravy, thickens.",7,Big Bang Theory,43,8
33307,Sheldon,9, I don't care for your mother's bathroom. There's not an angle to do one's business without a clown figurine staring at you.,7,Big Bang Theory,124,22
33308,Howard,9, That's why I sit.,7,Big Bang Theory,18,4
33310,Sheldon,9, 1993. Leon Lett blew the game in the final seconds and the Dolphins emerged victorious. Then I finally got to do my calculus.,7,Big Bang Theory,126,23
33312,Sheldon,9, So was my dad. And then he did.,7,Big Bang Theory,32,8
33313,Howard,9, Anyone need a beer?,7,Big Bang Theory,20,4
33315,Howard,9, Thank God.,7,Big Bang Theory,11,2
33317,Sheldon,9, No. He died when I was 14.,7,Big Bang Theory,27,7
33319,Sheldon,9, So was the man who owned the local liquor store. He cried and cried.,7,Big Bang Theory,69,14
33320,Howard,9, Here you go.,7,Big Bang Theory,13,3
33322,Sheldon,9," No, sir. He did try to give me one for my high school graduation, but I was 11 and my mom said no.",7,Big Bang Theory,99,23
33324,Sheldon,9, All right.,7,Big Bang Theory,11,2
33326,Howard,9," I never had a beer with my dad, either.",7,Big Bang Theory,40,9
33327,Sheldon,9, Do you mind? We're having a moment here.,7,Big Bang Theory,41,8
33329,Amy,9, I can't believe Penny's married to Zack.,7,Big Bang Theory,41,7
33330,Raj,9, Wonder what she saw in that guy.,7,Big Bang Theory,33,7
33332,Amy,9," Broad shoulders, good hair.",7,Big Bang Theory,28,4
33333,Raj,9, Hmm. Wonder what she sees in Leonard.,7,Big Bang Theory,38,7
33335,Howard,9, Sheldon and your dad are bonding and completely ignoring me.,7,Big Bang Theory,61,10
33336,Amy,9, I know how you feel. Sheldon ignored me for a week when he got that Roomba vacuum. I kick it when he's not looking.,7,Big Bang Theory,116,24
33338,Howard,9, They're drinking beer and watching football. ,7,Big Bang Theory,46,6
33340,Howard,9, They don't want me.,7,Big Bang Theory,20,4
33342,Howard,9," Well, Sheldon started talking about how his dad isn't alive any more, and they were toasting, and I tried to tell them about how sad I was when my dad abandoned",7,Big Bang Theory,161,31
33343,Amy,9, Zack's here!,7,Big Bang Theory,13,2
33344,Raj,9, Stir the gravy. ,7,Big Bang Theory,17,3
33347,Leonard,9, Sorry she made you come over here on a holiday.,7,Big Bang Theory,48,10
33349,Penny,9," Yeah, okay, great. Can we just get this over with?",7,Big Bang Theory,51,10
33350,Leonard,9," Yeah, uh, you guys have to sign here and here. On Monday, we'll file for the annulment, and this marriage will be over.",7,Big Bang Theory,120,23
33351,Penny,9, Okay.,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
33354,Leonard,9, Why won't you sign it?,7,Big Bang Theory,23,5
33356,Penny,9, We don't have any kids.,7,Big Bang Theory,24,5
33358,Penny,9," Okay, look, Zack, come on. You know neither of us thought this was real. I mean, we were married by an Elvis impersonator.",7,Big Bang Theory,123,23
33360,Leonard,9, You married him instead of me? Good call. Sign the papers.,7,Big Bang Theory,59,11
33361,Penny,9," Hang on. You know what? You have been a jerk about this all day. You always do this, whenever I mess up, you're right there to make me feel even worse about it.",7,Big Bang Theory,161,33
33362,Leonard,9, That is not true.,7,Big Bang Theory,18,4
33363,Penny,9," Yeah, we could've waited till Monday, signed the papers, this all would have been over.",7,Big Bang Theory,88,15
33364,Leonard,9, You're the one who invited him here.,7,Big Bang Theory,37,7
33365,Penny,9," Oh, there you go again, just another mistake you're throwing in my face.",7,Big Bang Theory,73,13
33367,Leonard,9," Yeah, well, she's not gonna be your wife for long.",7,Big Bang Theory,51,10
33369,Penny,9, I'm about to. Sign the paper.,7,Big Bang Theory,30,6
33372,Sheldon,9," Two, three, eight, four, six.  That's all I can do without throwing up.",7,Big Bang Theory,72,13
33376,Sheldon,9," All I know is you can only fit one of her in a car. And there's the clown that came out of her. I really didn't want to come here, but this is shaping up to be one of the best Thanksgivings I've had in a long time.",7,Big Bang Theory,215,48
33379,Sheldon,9, She's so tiny. It's funny when she's mad.,7,Big Bang Theory,42,8
33380,Amy,9," All right, mister, I think you owe Howard and Bernadette an apology.",7,Big Bang Theory,69,12
33381,Sheldon,9," Perhaps you're right. I'm sorry for my behaviour. I've had alcohol, and it's caused me to be inappropriate.",7,Big Bang Theory,108,18
33383,Howard,9, Don't worry about it.,7,Big Bang Theory,22,4
33384,Amy,9, Thank you.,7,Big Bang Theory,11,2
33385,Sheldon,9, Ain't she great? ,7,Big Bang Theory,18,3
33387,Amy,9, Sheldon.,7,Big Bang Theory,9,1
33388,Sheldon,9," Now, how's about you get us a couple of beers?",7,Big Bang Theory,47,10
33391,Amy,9," Yeah, everything was delicious.",7,Big Bang Theory,32,4
33392,Raj,9," Well, I couldn't have done it without my two favourite girls. Martha Stewart and Rachael Ray.",7,Big Bang Theory,94,16
33394,Sheldon,9, This is a Jewish house. I don't think they have pigskin.,7,Big Bang Theory,57,11
33396,Penny,9," Hey, I'm sorry about today. And I promise, next time I get married, it won't be a joke. It'll be for love. Or money.",7,Big Bang Theory,117,24
33397,Leonard,9," I'm sorry, too.",7,Big Bang Theory,16,3
33400,Howard,9," Mike, that's the nicest thing you've ever said to me.",7,Big Bang Theory,54,10
33402,Sheldon,9, I just vomited on a lot of clowns.,7,Big Bang Theory,35,8
33405,Sheldon,10," Thank you. Uh, the university made me come here. I didn't want to. Uh, big fan of the show.",7,Big Bang Theory,92,19
33407,Sheldon,10, Yes.,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
33409,Sheldon,10, Who? Give me their names. I bet it's Wolowitz.,7,Big Bang Theory,47,9
33411,Sheldon,10, Can we talk about something else? Do you know that I yodel?,7,Big Bang Theory,60,12
33413,Sheldon,10," Yes, yes, I'd be a physicist with a Nobel in chemistry. Everyone laugh at the circus freak. You know, I don't need to sit here and take this, Flatow. It is because of bullies like you, every day more and more Americans are making the switch to television.",7,Big Bang Theory,256,48
33415,Sheldon,10," President Seibert, I don't know why you're yelling. You're the one who made me go on the radio. I was expecting a professional science interview, not an attack by some morning zoo shock jock. Well, if the university needs money so badly, perhaps you should start a swear jar. Whoa, that one's worth a dollar.",7,Big Bang Theory,309,55
33416,Amy,10," I know you don't like it, but every time you do an interview, it raises the profile of the university. That translates to funding.",7,Big Bang Theory,131,24
33417,Sheldon,10," Yeah, well, I'm not just some trained monkey dancing for coins.",7,Big Bang Theory,64,11
33418,Leonard,10, Of course you're not. People love trained monkeys.,7,Big Bang Theory,51,8
33419,Penny,10," How can you not be happy? You're tall, thin and famous. Oh, my God, I'm jealous of Sheldon.",7,Big Bang Theory,92,18
33420,Sheldon,10," Look, you're gonna be doing this stuff for a while. You're just gonna have to find a way to get used to it.",7,Big Bang Theory,108,23
33421,Sheldon,10, But none of you know what this is like. Being celebrated for something you wish you never did.,7,Big Bang Theory,95,18
33422,Penny,10," Mmm, you clearly haven't been with me at Mardi Gras.",7,Big Bang Theory,53,10
33425,Howard,10, I am cleaning up. Look at the mess the Joker made of Gotham City.,7,Big Bang Theory,66,14
33427,Howard,10," Raj grew up in India. Trust me, he's seen worse.",7,Big Bang Theory,49,10
33429,Howard,10, I promise I'll help out the rest of the week.,7,Big Bang Theory,46,10
33431,Howard,10," Yeah, but if I told you a week, would you have said yes?",7,Big Bang Theory,57,13
33433,Howard,10, Then you left me no choice.,7,Big Bang Theory,28,6
33435,Howard,10," I know, but they're tenting his building. He can't find a hotel he likes that allows dogs.",7,Big Bang Theory,91,17
33437,Howard,10," For a whole week, the nerve of some people.",7,Big Bang Theory,44,9
33439,Sheldon,10," Here comes the Embarrassment Express. With stops at Fraudville, Wonder Blunderberg, and Kansas City. Because it's a hub.",7,Big Bang Theory,121,18
33440,Amy,10," Sheldon, can I come in?",7,Big Bang Theory,24,5
33441,Sheldon,10, Do you have cookies?,7,Big Bang Theory,21,4
33442,Amy,10, No.,7,Big Bang Theory,4,1
33443,Sheldon,10, Good. I don't deserve cookies. Come in. Wil?,7,Big Bang Theory,45,8
33445,Sheldon,10, Why are you here?,7,Big Bang Theory,18,4
33447,Sheldon,10," Certainly. Although, right now, I'm having a rough time because there's three people in my room, and it's starting to feel like a discotheque.",7,Big Bang Theory,143,24
33448,Amy,10," Sheldon, you said you were unhappy getting attention for something you wished you never did.",7,Big Bang Theory,93,15
33450,Sheldon,10," Oh, nonsense, Wil. Your endless tweets are not that bad.",7,Big Bang Theory,57,10
33452,Sheldon,10, How could you not like getting attention for playing Wesley Crusher? You were wonderful. A know-it-all boy genius with an eidetic memory. Who couldn't relate to that?,7,Big Bang Theory,167,27
33454,Sheldon,10," That just happened to me. Next time you're stuck for a tweet, feel free to say what a jerk Ira Flatow is.",7,Big Bang Theory,106,22
33455,Amy,10," Sheldon, the point is Wil learned to embrace that part of his life and moved on to bigger and better things.",7,Big Bang Theory,109,21
33457,Amy,10," Uh, we're trying to cheer him up, so ",7,Big Bang Theory,38,8
33459,Sheldon,10, I do see what you're saying. That helps.,7,Big Bang Theory,41,8
33461,Sheldon,10, Would you two like to stay and play trains with me?,7,Big Bang Theory,52,11
33463,Amy,10, Okay.,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
33464,Sheldon,10," Oh, great, now, I work the controls, I say all aboard. You sit quietly and watch.",7,Big Bang Theory,82,16
33466,Sheldon,10, You should probably go.,7,Big Bang Theory,24,4
33468,Howard,10, You're gonna brush your teeth on my couch?,7,Big Bang Theory,43,8
33469,Raj,10," No, I'm gonna brush Cinnamon's teeth.",7,Big Bang Theory,38,6
33470,Howard,10, Why bother? She spends half the time licking her butt.,7,Big Bang Theory,55,10
33471,Raj,10, And the other half licking my face. That's why I'm brushing her teeth.,7,Big Bang Theory,71,13
33473,Howard,10," No, we were waiting for you.",7,Big Bang Theory,29,6
33475,Howard,10, Yeah. So what do you feel like making?,7,Big Bang Theory,39,8
33476,Raj,10," Howard, the poor thing just got home from work. Let me get you a glass of wine. I'll cook dinner.",7,Big Bang Theory,98,20
33478,Raj,10, Don't be silly. Sit. You look like you've had a long day.,7,Big Bang Theory,58,12
33479,Howard,10," No, she always looks like that. Because she married an idiot.",7,Big Bang Theory,62,11
33481,Raj,10," Please, this is my way of thanking you for letting me stay here. Now, tell us all about your day.",7,Big Bang Theory,98,20
33483,Howard,10," Well, I keep telling you to put that traffic app on your phone.",7,Big Bang Theory,64,13
33484,Raj,10," Hey, when you got home today complaining that you felt sick from eating too many jelly beans, did I tell you how to fix it? No. I said, aw, that must hurt, and I rubbed your belly.",7,Big Bang Theory,181,37
33485,Howard,10, I thought of you the whole time.,7,Big Bang Theory,33,7
33486,Raj,10, All I'm saying is there's a time to just listen. ,7,Big Bang Theory,50,10
33488,Raj,10, There's also a time to stop eating too many jelly beans. And it's when you're ten.,7,Big Bang Theory,83,16
33490,Sheldon,10," Hello, President Siebert. Thank you for taking my call. I just wanted you to know that you can now expect enthusiastic participation from me regarding my discovery. Oh, no, no, no, no. No need to thank mNo, thank my friend, Wil Wheaton. For your information, I have nine friends, hmm? Ten if we include you. Nine it is. Ah, it's ten. I'll count Wolowitz. Hello, friend Leonard.",7,Big Bang Theory,378,67
33491,Leonard,10," Hey, you're in a good mood.",7,Big Bang Theory,28,6
33492,Sheldon,10, I'm in a great mood.,7,Big Bang Theory,21,5
33493,Leonard,10," Well, you're about to be in an even better one. I didn't want to say anything until I knew for sure, but, I've been re-running the tests on your element in my lab and I disproved it. Your element does not exist.",7,Big Bang Theory,212,42
33494,Sheldon,10," Yeah, but what about the Chinese research team? They found it.",7,Big Bang Theory,63,11
33495,Leonard,10," Yeah, it turns out someone added simulated signals to the data files. They faked the results.",7,Big Bang Theory,94,16
33496,Sheldon,10, Really?,7,Big Bang Theory,8,1
33497,Leonard,10, Yes. Do you know what that means? That means all of this attention that you hate goes away.,7,Big Bang Theory,92,18
33498,Sheldon,10, So no more interviews?,7,Big Bang Theory,23,4
33499,Leonard,10," No, it's all over.",7,Big Bang Theory,19,4
33500,Sheldon,10, I can't believe it.,7,Big Bang Theory,20,4
33501,Leonard,10," Well, you're welcome.",7,Big Bang Theory,22,3
33502,Sheldon,10, You robbed me of my greatest achievement.,7,Big Bang Theory,42,7
33503,Leonard,10, What?,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
33504,Sheldon,10," I'm back down to nine friends. Make it eight, I'm sick of Wolowitz, too.",7,Big Bang Theory,73,14
33505,Leonard,10," I, I don't understand. All you've done since you discovered this stupid element was complain. I was trying to make you happy.",7,Big Bang Theory,126,22
33506,Sheldon,10," By taking away my only claim to fame? Well, if you wanted to make me happy, you could have told me a joke. Or shown me a cute video of a koala and an otter becoming unlikely friends.",7,Big Bang Theory,183,38
33507,Leonard,10," Oh, there is no winning with you. And koalas and otters don't even live near each other.",7,Big Bang Theory,89,17
33508,Sheldon,10," That's what makes their friendship unlikely,",7,Big Bang Theory,45,6
33509,Penny,10," Hey, what's with all the yelling?",7,Big Bang Theory,34,6
33510,Sheldon,10, Leonard disproved my element. Now all the attention is going to go away.,7,Big Bang Theory,73,13
33511,Penny,10," Oh, that's great. You must be thrilled, ",7,Big Bang Theory,41,7
33512,Sheldon,10," That's it, I'm down to seven friends.",7,Big Bang Theory,38,7
33513,Penny,10," He's counting hobbits and superheroes, right?",7,Big Bang Theory,46,6
33514,Sheldon,10," When I thought the element was real, I didn't want it. But now that Leonard made it not exist, I want it more than anything in the world.",7,Big Bang Theory,138,28
33515,Leonard,10," The, the element never existed. I didn't take it away, science took it away. Be mad at science.",7,Big Bang Theory,96,18
33516,Sheldon,10," Don't you dare use science against me. Science is my best friend. Oh, good, I'm back up to eight.",7,Big Bang Theory,98,19
33517,Leonard,10, Will you tell him he's out of his mind.,7,Big Bang Theory,40,9
33518,Penny,10," Actually, I get what he's saying.",7,Big Bang Theory,34,6
33519,Sheldon,10," Oh, yes, nine. Welcome back, buddy.",7,Big Bang Theory,36,6
33520,Penny,10," It's like if you're dating someone you're not that into, and then they break up with you and then you want them more than ever.",7,Big Bang Theory,128,25
33521,Sheldon,10," I have no idea what she's talking about, but we're ganging up on you so I agree.",7,Big Bang Theory,81,17
33522,Leonard,10," Okay, Sheldon, what do you want me to do, hide the information? If I don't publish it, it's just a matter of time before someone else does.",7,Big Bang Theory,140,27
33523,Sheldon,10," No, no, of course you have to publish. That's your responsibility as a scientist. Doing otherwise would be unethical. You have no choice.",7,Big Bang Theory,138,23
33524,Leonard,10," Fine, I'll publish.",7,Big Bang Theory,20,3
33525,Sheldon,10, Can you believe this guy?,7,Big Bang Theory,26,5
33528,Howard,10, How do you know I didn't do them?,7,Big Bang Theory,34,8
33530,Raj,10," Good morning, everybody. I picked up coffee while I was out. Bernadette, here's your soy peppermint mocha.",7,Big Bang Theory,107,17
33532,Raj,10," Oh, my pleasure, and don't worry about your presentation today. You're gonna be great.",7,Big Bang Theory,87,14
33533,Howard,10," Yeah, you're gonna knock it out of the park.",7,Big Bang Theory,45,9
33535,Howard,10, Just go.,7,Big Bang Theory,9,2
33536,Raj,10, He loves you.,7,Big Bang Theory,14,3
33537,Howard,10, What are you doing? Are you trying to make me look bad?,7,Big Bang Theory,56,12
33538,Raj,10, I'm just being a good house guest.,7,Big Bang Theory,35,7
33539,Howard,10," No, you're being a better husband than I am. Doing the dishes, getting coffee, knowing about her life, who does that?",7,Big Bang Theory,118,21
33540,Raj,10," Oh, come on, I brought you one, too.",7,Big Bang Theory,37,8
33541,Howard,10, I don't want coffee.,7,Big Bang Theory,21,4
33542,Raj,10, That's why I got you hot chocolate.,7,Big Bang Theory,36,7
33543,Howard,10, Give me that. Just stop showing me up.,7,Big Bang Theory,39,8
33544,Raj,10," Howard, listen to me. You're a great husband. Yes, your listening skills could use some work. But it's amazing how far you've come given that you're an only child raised by an over-protective mom.",7,Big Bang Theory,197,34
33545,Howard,10," Um, is this getting weird?",7,Big Bang Theory,27,5
33546,Raj,10, Hang on.,7,Big Bang Theory,9,2
33547,Howard,10," So, yes.",7,Big Bang Theory,9,2
33549,Leonard,10," Hey. I just wanted to let you know that I, I posted my findings.",7,Big Bang Theory,65,14
33550,Sheldon,10, I saw. And I just posted a retraction of my paper. Now the whole scientific community knows I was wrong.,7,Big Bang Theory,105,20
33551,Leonard,10," These things happen all the time, Sheldon.",7,Big Bang Theory,43,7
33552,Sheldon,10, Not to me. The only other retraction I ever had to issue was when I was seven and I conceded that my brother was the greatest ninja in East Texas. But that was just a ploy to get my face out of his armpit.,7,Big Bang Theory,206,44
33554,Leonard,10," Come on, don't give him a hard time.",7,Big Bang Theory,37,8
33556,Leonard,10, It's not a big deal.,7,Big Bang Theory,21,5
33558,Leonard,10," Okay, Barry, that's enough.",7,Big Bang Theory,28,4
33559,Sheldon,10," No, no, no, that's okay. I can fight my own battles. Isn't that right, Bawwy.",7,Big Bang Theory,78,15
33561,Sheldon,10," You're right, That was uncalled for. I take it back.",7,Big Bang Theory,53,10
33565,Raj,10, Nonsense. You need a little fattening up. You've been looking too skinny lately.,7,Big Bang Theory,81,13
33567,Howard,10," What are you talking about? Remember last week, when I asked you if you were wearing Spanx and you weren't? How's that different?",7,Big Bang Theory,130,23
33569,Howard,10," Yeah, well, maybe you could try being more like Raj. ",7,Big Bang Theory,54,10
33571,Howard,10," Yeah, yeah. He packed me a lunch this morning. And there was a note inside that said go get 'em.",7,Big Bang Theory,97,20
33573,Howard,10," I do know to go get 'em, but sometimes it's nice to have emotional support when I'm going and getting them.",7,Big Bang Theory,108,21
33574,Raj,10," Hey, hey, do you hear yourselves? Let's just, you know, all calm down and take a step back.",7,Big Bang Theory,92,18
33576,Howard,10, I don't know. I guess I was just feeling like I'm a lousy husband.,7,Big Bang Theory,67,14
33578,Howard,10, Are you kidding? You're the best. I know what the problem is. It's him.,7,Big Bang Theory,72,14
33579,Raj,10," Oh, what did I do?",7,Big Bang Theory,19,5
33580,Howard,10, You made us feel like we're not trying hard enough.,7,Big Bang Theory,52,10
33582,Raj,10," Look, I'm sorry you're upset with me, but I just have to say it's nice to see the two of you on the same page.",7,Big Bang Theory,111,25
33583,Howard,10," Oh, it does feel good to have you backing me up for once.",7,Big Bang Theory,58,13
33585,Howard,10, That is not he's doing it again. ,7,Big Bang Theory,34,7
33588,Leonard,10, I can't believe they kicked you out. ,7,Big Bang Theory,38,7
33589,Raj,10," I can't believe they're still married. Oh, no, I forgot Cinnamon's toothbrush at Howard's. I guess you're sharing with Daddy again. ",7,Big Bang Theory,133,21
33590,Penny,10, Bark once if you need me to call PETA.,7,Big Bang Theory,39,9
33591,Sheldon,10, What's that animal doing in our apartment?,7,Big Bang Theory,43,7
33592,Leonard,10," Oh, relax, she's in her crate. She can't get out.",7,Big Bang Theory,50,10
33593,Sheldon,10," I have two words for you, Jurassic Park. This day just keeps getting worse and worse.",7,Big Bang Theory,86,16
33594,Penny,10," You know, if it makes you feel any better",7,Big Bang Theory,42,9
33595,Sheldon,10, It probably won't.,7,Big Bang Theory,19,3
33596,Penny,10, You're probably right.,7,Big Bang Theory,23,3
33597,Amy,10," Sheldon, it's a beautiful night. Why don't you and I go for a nice walk together?",7,Big Bang Theory,82,16
33598,Sheldon,10," Oh, everything is just sex with you isn't it?",7,Big Bang Theory,46,9
33599,Raj,10," Sheldon, I think you might find the support you're looking for if you realize that relationships are a give and take. She can only be there for you as much as you are for her.",7,Big Bang Theory,176,35
33600,Amy,10," Thank you, Rajesh.",7,Big Bang Theory,19,3
33601,Raj,10," And, Amy, you need to be patient with Sheldon, instead of pressuring him to accept intimacy on your terms.",7,Big Bang Theory,107,19
33602,Amy,10, You should probably go.,7,Big Bang Theory,24,4
33605,Leonard,10, Thanks.,7,Big Bang Theory,8,1
33606,Sheldon,10," Thank you. Ira, if I may, I'd like to apologize for my behaviour last week.",7,Big Bang Theory,76,15
33608,Sheldon,10," Now, isn't there something you'd like to say to me?",7,Big Bang Theory,52,10
33610,Leonard,10, Well,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
33611,Sheldon,10, I believe I can answer that.,7,Big Bang Theory,29,6
33612,Leonard,10, He asked me.,7,Big Bang Theory,13,3
33613,Sheldon,10, Fine.,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
33614,Leonard,10, As I was saying,7,Big Bang Theory,16,4
33615,Sheldon,10," You're telling it wrong. Ira, to really understand the story here, you have to start at the very beginning. A small town in East Texas, where a young genius named",7,Big Bang Theory,163,30
33616,Leonard,10, Sheldon.,7,Big Bang Theory,9,1
33617,Sheldon,10," That's right, Sheldon Cooper. He was bitten by his neighbour's dog, leading to his first scientific breakthrough, the doggie death-ray. Which, sadly, he couldn't build because Santa wouldn't bring him enriched uranium.",7,Big Bang Theory,219,32
33619,Sheldon,10, What a surprise. Did you invite me back just so you could ignore me?,7,Big Bang Theory,69,14
33621,Leonard,10," Sheldon, this interview is supposed to be about me.",7,Big Bang Theory,52,9
33622,Sheldon,10," Well, that seems like a snooze. Even for public radio.",7,Big Bang Theory,55,10
33623,Penny,10," You know, if we did a shot every time they said something embarrassing, this would be one hell of a drinking game.",7,Big Bang Theory,115,22
33624,Amy,10," A little early for alcohol, isn't it?",7,Big Bang Theory,38,7
33625,Sheldon,10," You know, I don't just say smart things about science. I also yodel. ",7,Big Bang Theory,70,13
33626,Amy,10, I'll get the vodka.,7,Big Bang Theory,20,4
33628,Penny,11," Wow, you're really good at this.",7,Big Bang Theory,33,6
33629,Amy,11," Well, I have an extremely low centre of gravity. I'm like a pyramid.",7,Big Bang Theory,69,13
33630,Penny,11, How you doing over there?,7,Big Bang Theory,26,5
33631,Leonard,11," Oh, I hope it's just a sprain. I cannot walk into that E.R. with another video game injury.",7,Big Bang Theory,92,18
33632,Penny,11," Hey, Sheldon, you want to play next?",7,Big Bang Theory,37,7
33633,Sheldon,11," Oh, I would, but I'm on my way out.",7,Big Bang Theory,36,9
33634,Leonard,11, Where?,7,Big Bang Theory,7,1
33635,Sheldon,11, Texas.,7,Big Bang Theory,7,1
33636,Amy,11, Right now? Why?,7,Big Bang Theory,16,3
33637,Leonard,11, Is someone sick?,7,Big Bang Theory,17,3
33638,Sheldon,11, Yes. My sister's uterus came down with a baby.,7,Big Bang Theory,47,9
33639,Penny,11," Oh, she's pregnant? That's great. You're gone an uncle. Uncle Sheldon.",7,Big Bang Theory,71,11
33640,Sheldon,11," No, I will be Uncle Dr. Cooper.",7,Big Bang Theory,32,7
33641,Amy,11, How come you never said she was pregnant?,7,Big Bang Theory,42,8
33642,Sheldon,11," Well, I never told you about my brother's kidney stone. You want to hear about everything that comes out of my family's genitals?",7,Big Bang Theory,130,23
33643,Leonard,11," Well, congrats, and it's nice you're gonna be there for your sister.",7,Big Bang Theory,69,12
33644,Sheldon,11, Yes. I'm filling in for her husband who's recovering from a horrible motorcycle accident. Lucky duck.,7,Big Bang Theory,102,16
33645,Penny,11," Wow, so, how long will you be gone?",7,Big Bang Theory,36,8
33646,Sheldon,11," Well, she's due tomorrow. Although it did take her six years to finish high school, so who knows?",7,Big Bang Theory,98,18
33647,Amy,11, Can I give you a ride to the airport?,7,Big Bang Theory,38,9
33648,Sheldon,11," Oh, no, thank you, I don't want to be an inconvenience. Chop-chop, Leonard. We leave in ten minutes.",7,Big Bang Theory,101,18
33650,Leonard,11," All right, here's the deal. Sheldon is gone, so the tree decorating rules are out the window.",7,Big Bang Theory,94,17
33651,Penny,11," Yeah, which means we don't have to use his ridiculous ornament-spacing template.",7,Big Bang Theory,81,12
33652,Leonard,11, And I'm happy to report its kickstarter campaign is holding strong at zero dollars.,7,Big Bang Theory,84,14
33653,Penny,11, Ah.,7,Big Bang Theory,4,1
33654,Raj,11," Wait, so Star Wars and Star Trek characters can go on the same branch?",7,Big Bang Theory,71,14
33655,Leonard,11," I know, it's crazy. Welcome to the Thunderdome, people. ",7,Big Bang Theory,57,9
33656,Howard,11, I've never done this before. It's kind of fun.,7,Big Bang Theory,47,9
33657,Raj,11," Yeah, if your mom could see her little Bar Mitzvah boy right now, she'd have a heart attack.",7,Big Bang Theory,93,18
33659,Penny,11," Honey, I'm a little strapped for cash this year, so for Christmas I was thinking of giving you this.",7,Big Bang Theory,101,19
33660,Leonard,11, I love it.,7,Big Bang Theory,11,3
33661,Penny,11, Okay.,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
33662,Leonard,11, But it is what you got me last year.,7,Big Bang Theory,37,9
33663,Penny,11, Yeah.,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
33664,Leonard,11, And last night.,7,Big Bang Theory,16,3
33668,Amy,11," Oh, it's probably Sheldon. Hi, Sheldon. Everybody's here, say hi.",7,Big Bang Theory,66,10
33669,Penny,11, Hi. ,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
33670,Leonard,11," Hey, buddy.",7,Big Bang Theory,12,2
33671,Raj,11, Hey.,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
33672,Howard,11, Howdy.,7,Big Bang Theory,7,1
33675,Sheldon,11, The second I go out of town you throw a Christmas party without me? ,7,Big Bang Theory,69,14
33676,Amy,11," Yeah, kinda.",7,Big Bang Theory,13,2
33677,Sheldon,11, That's so thoughtful. You guys are the best.,7,Big Bang Theory,45,8
33678,Penny,11," Hey, how's your sister?",7,Big Bang Theory,24,4
33679,Sheldon,11, <i>She went into labor an hour ago.,7,Big Bang Theory,36,7
33680,Amy,11, That's wonderful. So you're at the hospital?,7,Big Bang Theory,45,7
33681,Sheldon,11," No, she chose to have a home birth because she wants to live in the Stone Age and a cave wasn't available.",7,Big Bang Theory,107,22
33682,Raj,11," You know, many people believe that home births are better because the mother is in a warm, comfortable environment where she can be nurtured by loved ones.",7,Big Bang Theory,156,27
33683,Sheldon,11, And turn the bedroom floor into an amniotic Slip â€˜n Slide.,7,Big Bang Theory,61,11
33685,Sheldon,11," Oh, boy. I picked the wrong day to wear my good robot T-shirt.",7,Big Bang Theory,63,13
33686,Raj,11, If you were having Sheldon's baby would you really want him in the room?,7,Big Bang Theory,73,14
33687,Penny,11," Yeah, if he's in the room when they're making the baby, I'll give you ten dollars.",7,Big Bang Theory,83,16
33689,Amy,11," Oh, I love that movie.",7,Big Bang Theory,23,5
33690,Raj,11, I've never seen it.,7,Big Bang Theory,20,4
33692,Amy,11, It's great. It's Christmastime and Jimmy Stewart's really depressed and he's gonna jump off a bridge and kill himself.,7,Big Bang Theory,119,19
33695,Penny,11," Hey, you ever imagine what that would be like? Not being born?",7,Big Bang Theory,63,12
33696,Leonard,11,  What do you think?  What do you think?  What do you think?,7,Big Bang Theory,60,12
33697,Amy,11," You make jokes about Sheldon, but if it weren't for him, I don't think any of us would be sitting in this room right now.",7,Big Bang Theory,122,25
33698,Howard,11, Really? Sheldon not being here is the main reason I'm in this room.,7,Big Bang Theory,68,13
33699,Amy,11, It's true. None of you would know me. You wouldn't know Bernadette. You wouldn't be dating Penny.,7,Big Bang Theory,98,17
33700,Leonard,11, You don't know that. I've been going to the Cheesecake Factory for years. I could have picked her up.  ,7,Big Bang Theory,104,19
33701,Penny,11," Oh, you weren't joking.",7,Big Bang Theory,24,4
33702,Leonard,11, No.,7,Big Bang Theory,4,1
33703,Penny,11," Okay, sweetie, let me tell you exactly how that would have gone down.",7,Big Bang Theory,70,13
33704,Leonard,11, I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna ask her out.,7,Big Bang Theory,40,9
33705,Howard,11," I'm gonna squirt chocolate milk out of my nipples. Sorry, I thought we're saying things that are never gonna happen.",7,Big Bang Theory,117,20
33706,Raj,11, Maybe this time he's going to do it.,7,Big Bang Theory,37,8
33707,Howard,11," Hope you're thirsty, here it comes.",7,Big Bang Theory,36,6
33708,Leonard,11, Watch me.,7,Big Bang Theory,10,2
33709,Penny,11," Hey, you guys ready to order or you need a few minutes?",7,Big Bang Theory,56,12
33710,Leonard,11," I, uh, ah, um, I",7,Big Bang Theory,17,5
33711,Penny,11, A few minutes it is.,7,Big Bang Theory,21,5
33712,Raj,11," You didn't ask her out, but that was a lot of sounds.",7,Big Bang Theory,54,12
33713,Leonard,11, You guys are making me nervous.,7,Big Bang Theory,32,6
33714,Howard,11," Fine, then go talk to her on your own.",7,Big Bang Theory,39,9
33715,Leonard,11, I will. Excuse me.,7,Big Bang Theory,19,4
33716,Penny,11, Yeah?,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
33717,Leonard,11," Hi, uh, um, I'm Leonard?",7,Big Bang Theory,25,5
33718,Penny,11, Really? You don't sound so sure.,7,Big Bang Theory,33,6
33719,Leonard,11," No, I am he. Uh, any, anyway, um, there's been something I've wanted to ask you for a long time. Um.",7,Big Bang Theory,101,21
33720,Penny,11, What's that?,7,Big Bang Theory,13,2
33721,Leonard,11," Eh, uh, well, I was wondering, if you're not too busy, um, uh, if, if you'd be interested in telling me where the restroom is?",7,Big Bang Theory,127,25
33722,Penny,11, I think you're too late.,7,Big Bang Theory,25,5
33723,Leonard,11," Come on, I would not have peed my pants.",7,Big Bang Theory,41,9
33724,Howard,11, She nailed it.,7,Big Bang Theory,15,3
33725,Raj,11, Sounds about right.,7,Big Bang Theory,20,3
33726,Leonard,11," But, you forget, I did ask you out in real life.",7,Big Bang Theory,49,11
33727,Amy,11," Which couldn't have happened if you didn't live across the hall from her, which couldn't have happened without Sheldon. Same goes with you guys. If Leonard wasn't with Penny, she never would have set you up.",7,Big Bang Theory,208,36
33728,Howard,11," Doesn't matter. Bernadette still would've been working at The Cheesecake Factory, and I still would've been working this beefcake factory. You would've been all over me.",7,Big Bang Theory,170,26
33731,Penny,11," Sure, why?",7,Big Bang Theory,11,2
33733,Raj,11," Open wide, here comes the happy train.",7,Big Bang Theory,39,7
33734,Howard,11," Mm-hmm, chug-a-chug-a, yum, yum.",7,Big Bang Theory,33,4
33735,Raj,11," Oh. Hang on. You got a, you got a little something. Ah.",7,Big Bang Theory,56,12
33737,Raj,11," Oh, man, that is so us.",7,Big Bang Theory,24,6
33738,Leonard,11," You know, maybe you and I wouldn't be together, but you wouldn't have done so great yourself.",7,Big Bang Theory,94,17
33739,Penny,11, Why? ,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
33740,Leonard,11, Because I know exactly the kind of guy you would've ended up with.,7,Big Bang Theory,67,13
33742,Penny,11, Hey. Did you remember to pay the rent?,7,Big Bang Theory,39,8
33744,Penny,11," Hey, he may be an idiot, but at least he didn't pee himself.",7,Big Bang Theory,61,13
33745,Leonard,11," Oh, hold on.",7,Big Bang Theory,13,3
33747,Penny,11," Me, too.",7,Big Bang Theory,9,2
33748,Leonard,11, The end.,7,Big Bang Theory,9,2
33749,Amy,11," Hi, Sheldon. Everything okay?",7,Big Bang Theory,30,4
33750,Sheldon,11," No, it's not. I've seen things. Lady things.",7,Big Bang Theory,45,8
33751,Amy,11, Listen to me. That is not the way they usually look.,7,Big Bang Theory,53,11
33752,Sheldon,11, Doesn't matter. This is no way to make new humans. People coming out of people. It's some kind of dirty magic show.,7,Big Bang Theory,116,22
33754,Sheldon,11, Did you hear that? A mop. I have two PhDs yet somehow I'm the janitor of my sister's birth canal.,7,Big Bang Theory,98,20
33755,Leonard,11," Hey, Sheldon sent us all an e-mail. Happy holidays from Texas. And there's pictures. Aah! Don't open them. Do not open them.",7,Big Bang Theory,125,22
33756,Penny,11," Oh, come on. Childbirth is a natural, beautiful, uuurgh, it's like someone sawed a cow in half.",7,Big Bang Theory,96,17
33757,Raj,11," My father's a gynaecologist, I think I can handle it. And, now, I'm gay.",7,Big Bang Theory,73,14
33759,Amy,11," And with Leonard out of the picture, we all know what that would mean.",7,Big Bang Theory,71,14
33760,Penny,11, We do?,7,Big Bang Theory,7,2
33761,Penny,11," Hey, Sheldon.",7,Big Bang Theory,14,2
33762,Sheldon,11, Hello.,7,Big Bang Theory,7,1
33763,Penny,11, Doing laundry?,7,Big Bang Theory,15,2
33764,Sheldon,11," Of course I'm doing laundry. Saturday night is laundry night, and I'm in a laundry room, so, I believe your inference is justified.",7,Big Bang Theory,132,23
33765,Penny,11," Oh, my inference is justified. Sheldon, you are so funny. Anyway, I need to do my laundry, too, because these clothes are so dirty. Almost as dirty as the dirty girl who's wearing them.",7,Big Bang Theory,186,34
33766,Penny,11," Okay, that's enough.",7,Big Bang Theory,21,3
33767,Leonard,11, Disagree.,7,Big Bang Theory,10,1
33768,Raj,11, Keep going. ,7,Big Bang Theory,13,2
33769,Howard,11, More.,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
33770,Penny,11," So, what do you think?",7,Big Bang Theory,23,5
33771,Sheldon,11," A tad asymmetrical, but nothing to be concerned about.",7,Big Bang Theory,55,9
33772,Penny,11," Please, Sheldon. I need you.",7,Big Bang Theory,29,5
33773,Sheldon,11, To what?,7,Big Bang Theory,9,2
33774,Penny,11, To take me.,7,Big Bang Theory,12,3
33775,Sheldon,11, I'm not taking you anywhere till you put on a shirt.,7,Big Bang Theory,53,11
33776,Penny,11," Come on, Sheldon. You and me right here.",7,Big Bang Theory,41,8
33777,Sheldon,11," Penny, for the thousandth time, I'm saving myself for someone special. Perhaps a cute bespectacled neuroscientist with hair the color of mud. ",7,Big Bang Theory,143,22
33778,Penny,11, I think I know how to change your mind.,7,Big Bang Theory,40,9
33779,Leonard,11, That's enough.,7,Big Bang Theory,15,2
33780,Raj,11, Ew.,7,Big Bang Theory,4,1
33782,Amy,11," How's it going, Sheldon?",7,Big Bang Theory,25,4
33783,Sheldon,11," Actually, much better.",7,Big Bang Theory,23,3
33784,Leonard,11," Oh, good. Is the baby born yet?",7,Big Bang Theory,32,7
33785,Sheldon,11, I don't know. I just got back. ,7,Big Bang Theory,32,7
33786,Amy,11, Where'd you go?,7,Big Bang Theory,16,3
33787,Sheldon,11," My mother asked me to get some towels. I took advantage of the vague request and went to Bed, Bath & Beyond.  Excuse me, I'm on the phone. So rude.",7,Big Bang Theory,148,30
33788,Amy,11," Here's another one. Penny, if it weren't for Sheldon you never would have met comic book legend Stan Lee.",7,Big Bang Theory,106,19
33789,Penny,11, Great.,7,Big Bang Theory,7,1
33790,Raj,11," At least Leonard, Howard and I would have always been friends.",7,Big Bang Theory,63,11
33792,Leonard,11," We talked about it, but Howard was in a pretty serious relationship with his mom.",7,Big Bang Theory,82,15
33793,Howard,11, I lived with her to save money.,7,Big Bang Theory,32,7
33794,Raj,11," Yeah, you didn't have to buy groceries 'cause you were breast-feeding.",7,Big Bang Theory,71,11
33796,Howard,11, Not exactly.,7,Big Bang Theory,13,2
33797,Penny,11," What do you mean, not exactly?",7,Big Bang Theory,31,6
33798,Howard,11," Well, things would be a little different.",7,Big Bang Theory,42,7
33800,Howard,11, I know you're starving. The neighbours know you're starving. There's starving people in Africa who know you're starving.,7,Big Bang Theory,121,18
33802,Howard,11,"Well, you cleaned out Earth. I don't know what else to do.",7,Big Bang Theory,58,12
33804,Howard,11," You didn't let me finish. Here you go, Mother.",7,Big Bang Theory,47,9
33806,Amy,11," Wait, did she die or did you kill her?",7,Big Bang Theory,39,9
33807,Howard,11," Eh, tomato, tomahto. The important thing is she's dead.",7,Big Bang Theory,56,9
33809,Leonard,11," Oh, this guy wanted a place of his own because he was sure he was gonna be a ladies' man.",7,Big Bang Theory,90,20
33810,Raj,11," Yeah, I was wrong. But I do think you and I would have had a great time.",7,Big Bang Theory,73,17
33811,Raj,11," Come on, Leonard, dinner.",7,Big Bang Theory,26,4
33813,Leonard,11, Hang on. Why would I be fat?,7,Big Bang Theory,29,7
33814,Raj,11," You'd have no girlfriend to see you naked, you'd try to fill the void with food, and I'm an enabler who once deep-fried a pancake.",7,Big Bang Theory,131,25
33815,Leonard,11," Why can't you be fat, too?",7,Big Bang Theory,27,6
33821,Raj,11, What are you doing?,7,Big Bang Theory,20,4
33823,Raj,11," Yeah, but why are you fat?",7,Big Bang Theory,27,6
33825,Penny,11," Amy, what about you? What do you think you'd be doing if you never met Sheldon?",7,Big Bang Theory,80,16
33826,Amy,11," It's hard to say, my life would be so different.",7,Big Bang Theory,49,10
33827,Howard,11, You can say better. Sheldon can't hear you.,7,Big Bang Theory,44,8
33828,Amy,11, I don't know.,7,Big Bang Theory,14,3
33829,Amy,11," Happy birthday to me, happy birthday to me, there's tears in the frosting, happy birthday to me. ",7,Big Bang Theory,98,17
33831,Amy,11," How's it going, Sheldon?",7,Big Bang Theory,25,4
33832,Sheldon,11, That's it. The baby's here. It's a boy.,7,Big Bang Theory,40,8
33833,Penny,11, Aw.,7,Big Bang Theory,4,1
33834,Amy,11, Yay.,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
33835,Raj,11, Congrats.,7,Big Bang Theory,10,1
33836,Sheldon,11," Oh, thank you. I wasn't sure I was gonna to make it. But my mother gave me some ice chips, my sister told me to breathe, and I just thought to myself, Sheldon, if you can make it through the Green Lantern movie, you can make it through this.",7,Big Bang Theory,242,49
33837,Leonard,11," Well, good for you, buddy. We'll let you get back in there.",7,Big Bang Theory,60,12
33838,Sheldon,11," Oh no, no, I'm not going back in there. That baby is so irritating. He has literally been crying his entire life.",7,Big Bang Theory,114,22
33839,Howard,11," Aw, he's already taking after Uncle Shelly.",7,Big Bang Theory,44,7
33840,Amy,11," Come on, Sheldon, you should go.",7,Big Bang Theory,33,6
33841,Sheldon,11, Why?,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
33842,Amy,11," Well, you always complain that you never had an intelligent role model growing up, and now you can be one for your nephew.",7,Big Bang Theory,123,23
33843,Sheldon,11," Ugh, all right, I'll go. But from what I've seen, his attention span is as limited as his bladder control.",7,Big Bang Theory,107,20
33846,Amy,11," If that were true, I wouldn't still be living alone. Well, not exactly alone. I do have a 50 pound sack of rice with one of Sheldon's T-shirts on it.",7,Big Bang Theory,150,30
33847,Leonard,11," I'm telling you, Sheldon cares for you more than you think.",7,Big Bang Theory,60,11
33848,Amy,11, I wish I could believe you. I also wish there wasn't a mouse living in Rice Sheldon.,7,Big Bang Theory,85,17
33849,Leonard,11," Hang on, I'm gonna give you a little early Christmas present. I'm gonna show you something, but if you ever told Sheldon he'd probably never speak to me again. So, if you want to tell him, that's fine. Look.",7,Big Bang Theory,208,39
33850,Amy,11, I don't understand.,7,Big Bang Theory,20,3
33851,Leonard,11, He made you his screensaver.,7,Big Bang Theory,29,5
33852,Amy,11," Oh. Wow. I had no idea. He is so into me. Wait, wait, where'd I go?",7,Big Bang Theory,68,16
33853,Leonard,11," Oh, well, it's you, Swamp Thing, Stephen Hawking, Spider-Man, but, look, you're in the mix.",7,Big Bang Theory,92,15
33854,Amy,11, I am in the mix. And I'm the hottest one.,7,Big Bang Theory,42,10
33855,Penny,11, Who's that?,7,Big Bang Theory,12,2
33856,Leonard,11," Oh, Madame Curie.",7,Big Bang Theory,18,3
33857,Amy,11," That's fine, she's dead.",7,Big Bang Theory,25,4
33859,Sheldon,11, You okay?,7,Big Bang Theory,10,2
33860,Amy,11, Just really glad you're back.,7,Big Bang Theory,30,5
33861,Sheldon,11," Me, too. I got a lot of TV to catch up on.",7,Big Bang Theory,43,12
33862,Amy,11, I missed you.,7,Big Bang Theory,14,3
33863,Sheldon,11," To quote Han Solo, I know.",7,Big Bang Theory,27,6
33864,Amy,11, Did you miss me?,7,Big Bang Theory,17,4
33865,Sheldon,11, I would've preferred to have you there with me.,7,Big Bang Theory,48,9
33866,Amy,11, Oh.,7,Big Bang Theory,4,1
33867,Sheldon,11, Or instead of me.,7,Big Bang Theory,18,4
33868,Amy,11, Did you hold the baby?,7,Big Bang Theory,23,5
33869,Sheldon,11, I did. ,7,Big Bang Theory,8,2
33870,Amy,11, And? How did it make you feel?,7,Big Bang Theory,31,7
33871,Sheldon,11," Looking into the blank, innocent eyes of a creature that couldn't begin to comprehend anything I was saying? Basically just another day at the office.",7,Big Bang Theory,151,25
33873,Howard,11, And chocolate milk is gonna squirt out of my nipples.,7,Big Bang Theory,54,10
33875,Penny,11, You guys need anything else?,7,Big Bang Theory,29,5
33877,Penny,11," I'm sorry, I have a boyfriend. In fact, there he is now. Ready to go, sweetheart?",7,Big Bang Theory,82,16
33880,Amy,12," This is nice, that we all get to eat together.",7,Big Bang Theory,47,10
33881,Leonard,12, Absolutely.,7,Big Bang Theory,12,1
33882,Amy,12, Hmm. Can we maybe put the phones down and have an actualhuman conversation?,7,Big Bang Theory,76,13
33883,Sheldon,12," We can, but thanks to Steve Jobs, we don't have to.",7,Big Bang Theory,52,11
33884,Penny,12," Guys, guys, you're never gonna believe this.",7,Big Bang Theory,45,7
33885,Leonard,12, What happened?,7,Big Bang Theory,15,2
33886,Penny,12, I just got a part on a TV show.,7,Big Bang Theory,32,9
33887,Amy,12, Congratulations.,7,Big Bang Theory,17,1
33888,Leonard,12, What? That's great. Guys.,7,Big Bang Theory,26,4
33889,Howard,12," Oh, yeah",7,Big Bang Theory,9,2
33890,Sheldon,12," Yay, Penny.",7,Big Bang Theory,12,2
33891,Amy,12, What's the show?,7,Big Bang Theory,17,3
33892,Penny,12," Um, NC II or, you know, NCSTD I don't know, it's, it's, you know, it's the one with the letters and I'm gonna be on it!",7,Big Bang Theory,120,26
33893,Leonard,12, That's amazing.,7,Big Bang Theory,16,2
33894,Penny,12, Yeah.,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
33895,Howard,12, What's your part?,7,Big Bang Theory,18,3
33896,Penny,12," Um, I play a customer in a diner and I flirt with Mark Harmon.",7,Big Bang Theory,63,14
33897,Raj,12," Ooh, Mark Harmon, he's a dreamboat.",7,Big Bang Theory,36,6
33898,Leonard,12," So it, it's just flirting?",7,Big Bang Theory,27,5
33899,Penny,12," Well, yeah. Why?",7,Big Bang Theory,17,3
33900,Leonard,12," Uh, no reason. I just think it's sexier when things are left to the imagination.",7,Big Bang Theory,81,15
33901,Amy,12, He's wrong.,7,Big Bang Theory,12,2
33903,Raj,12, So I read a study that says a man with a dog is three times more likely to get a woman's phone number.,7,Big Bang Theory,103,23
33904,Leonard,12, Is it true even when the man lets his dog lick peanut butter off his tongue?,7,Big Bang Theory,77,16
33905,Raj,12, I don't see why not. ,7,Big Bang Theory,22,5
33906,Howard,12," If you're really desperate to meet women and like having food eaten out of your mouth, I could set you up with my mom.",7,Big Bang Theory,119,24
33907,Sheldon,12, Why is that funny? That's just unhygienic.,7,Big Bang Theory,43,7
33908,Leonard,12, It's a joke.,7,Big Bang Theory,13,3
33909,Sheldon,12," I don't think so. I believe that a joke is a brief oral narrative with a climactic humorous twist. For example, uh, Wolowitz's mother is so fat that she decided to go on a diet, or exercise, or both. See? The twist is that people don't usually change. Well, they don't.",7,Big Bang Theory,270,51
33910,Penny,12," Hey, guys, don't forget, my episode's on TV tomorrow night.",7,Big Bang Theory,60,10
33911,Howard,12, We'll be there.,7,Big Bang Theory,16,3
33912,Raj,12, Can we bring anything?,7,Big Bang Theory,23,4
33913,Penny,12," Oh, that's so sweet of you, but I was gonna steal food from here. You know, my treat.",7,Big Bang Theory,86,18
33914,Sheldon,12," Wait, if Howard's mother is coming, then you should also steal marbles. Because she's obese, and hippos are obese, and in the popular board game Hungry Hungry Hippos, they eat marbles. Maybe I need to dumb these down for you. ",7,Big Bang Theory,227,40
33916,Sheldon,12," Leonard, do you think I'm funny?",7,Big Bang Theory,33,6
33917,Leonard,12, No. Do you?,7,Big Bang Theory,12,3
33918,Sheldon,12, I think I'm hysterical.,7,Big Bang Theory,24,4
33919,Leonard,12, I take it back. That was funny.,7,Big Bang Theory,32,7
33920,Sheldon,12, The philosopher Henri Bergson says it's funny when a human being behaves like an object. ,7,Big Bang Theory,90,15
33921,Leonard,12, I bet that bit killed at The Chuckle Hut.,7,Big Bang Theory,42,9
33922,Sheldon,12," Oh, he didn't perform stand-up comedy, he was a philosopher.",7,Big Bang Theory,61,10
33923,Leonard,12," You know, I think we're zeroing in on your problem.",7,Big Bang Theory,52,10
33924,Sheldon,12," Perhaps I'll spend some time developing a unified theory of comedy, which will allow me to elicit laughter from anyone at any time. Unless they're German, 'cause that's a tough crowd.",7,Big Bang Theory,184,31
33925,Leonard,12, Are you set on people laughing with you? â€˜Cause if you're cool with at you,7,Big Bang Theory,77,15
33926,Sheldon,12, I don't get it.,7,Big Bang Theory,16,4
33929,Howard,12, Really? I never for a second thought it'd be anything else.,7,Big Bang Theory,60,11
33930,Raj,12," I almost met someone last night, but I blew it. I was walking Cinnamon and this girl introduced herself, but she was so cute I panicked and said, wouldn't it be easier if instead of talking we could just sniff each other's butts?",7,Big Bang Theory,230,43
33933,Raj,12, Are possums cute?,7,Big Bang Theory,18,3
33935,Howard,12," If you're so intimidated by talking to attractive girls, maybe you should practice by talking to regular people.",7,Big Bang Theory,113,18
33936,Raj,12, You mean like fatties and uggos?,7,Big Bang Theory,33,6
33938,Howard,12," I'm serious. Go to the mall, talk to anybody, practice, that way when you eventually do talk to a cute girl, it won't be so scary.",7,Big Bang Theory,131,26
33943,Leonard,12, I'm so proud of you.,7,Big Bang Theory,21,5
33944,Penny,12, We haven't even gotten to my scene yet.,7,Big Bang Theory,40,8
33945,Leonard,12," I know, but you're going to be a TV star and you haven't left me yet. That takes guts.",7,Big Bang Theory,87,19
33946,Sheldon,12," I don't know about you, but I'm very uncomfortable with all this.",7,Big Bang Theory,66,12
33947,Amy,12, Why?,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
33948,Sheldon,12, I've never seen this show before and now I'm starting with episode 246? It's unnatural.,7,Big Bang Theory,88,15
33949,Amy,12, Just think of the first 245 as the prequel.,7,Big Bang Theory,44,9
33950,Sheldon,12, All right.,7,Big Bang Theory,11,2
33951,Penny,12," Okay, shh, guys, guys, this is it.",7,Big Bang Theory,35,7
33958,Penny,12, Are you kidding me?,7,Big Bang Theory,20,4
33959,Leonard,12, What's wrong?,7,Big Bang Theory,14,2
33960,Penny,12," Well, the diner scene. Where's my diner scene?",7,Big Bang Theory,47,8
33961,Sheldon,12," Well, don't ask me. Until I see the prequel, I'm lost.",7,Big Bang Theory,55,11
33962,Penny,12," No, there was supposed to be a big scene with me and Mark Harmon, but it's gone.",7,Big Bang Theory,81,17
33964,Penny,12, They must've cut it.,7,Big Bang Theory,21,4
33965,Leonard,12," Oh, Penny, I'm, I'm sorry. ",7,Big Bang Theory,28,5
33966,Howard,12, That stinks.,7,Big Bang Theory,13,2
33967,Raj,12, I'm sure you were great.,7,Big Bang Theory,25,5
33968,Penny,12," This doesn't make any sense. I mean, I, I thought I did a, a really good job, I Excuse me.",7,Big Bang Theory,91,20
33969,Sheldon,12, I've been studying how to make people laugh. They say that comedy is tragedy plus time. Let's tickle some ribs.,7,Big Bang Theory,112,20
33971,Penny,12," No, Dad, I don't think they cut me out of the show because I was too pretty. No, I don't need you to come out and kick Mark Harmon's ass. Daddy, I gotta go. I love you. Bye.",7,Big Bang Theory,174,38
33972,Leonard,12, How you doing?,7,Big Bang Theory,15,3
33973,Penny,12," Ugh, this is such a disaster. My parents had all my relatives over. They got one of those six-foot sandwiches, and got my brother a day pass out of rehab and now he's missing and the sandwich is missing, and they're probably in Mexico by now. So humiliating.",7,Big Bang Theory,259,48
33974,Leonard,12, You still got the part. That's a huge accomplishment.,7,Big Bang Theory,54,9
33975,Penny,12," Yeah, but this was supposed to be my break, okay? People were gonna see me in this show and it was gonna lead to bigger things. More auditions, more parts. Now none of that's gonna happen.",7,Big Bang Theory,189,36
33976,Leonard,12," Honey, you only had, like, three lines. That wasn't gonna happen anyway.",7,Big Bang Theory,73,12
33977,Penny,12, Unbelievable.,7,Big Bang Theory,14,1
33978,Leonard,12," Oh, come on, no, that's not what I meant.",7,Big Bang Theory,42,9
33979,Penny,12, Then what did you mean?,7,Big Bang Theory,24,5
33980,Leonard,12," I don't, look, you know, words don't always have to mean things.",7,Big Bang Theory,65,12
33981,Penny,12, I think you meant that you don't believe in me.,7,Big Bang Theory,48,10
33982,Leonard,12," Nope. Uh, uh, I might not know what I meant, but I know that I didn't mean that. Not this guy. Oh, no way.",7,Big Bang Theory,107,24
33983,Penny,12," I want you, right now, to give me your 100% honest opinion.",7,Big Bang Theory,60,12
33984,Leonard,12, Right.,7,Big Bang Theory,7,1
33985,Penny,12, Do you think I have what it takes to really make it as an actress?,7,Big Bang Theory,67,15
33986,Leonard,12, Yes.,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
33987,Penny,12, So you think I'll be on TV and in movies and win awards.,7,Big Bang Theory,57,13
33988,Leonard,12, Honestly?,7,Big Bang Theory,10,1
33989,Penny,12," Yes, honestly.",7,Big Bang Theory,15,2
33990,Leonard,12, I don't.,7,Big Bang Theory,9,2
33991,Penny,12, How could you say that?,7,Big Bang Theory,24,5
33992,Leonard,12," I don't know, I got all confused when you said honestly.",7,Big Bang Theory,57,11
33993,Penny,12, Oh.,7,Big Bang Theory,4,1
33994,Leonard,12," Look, do I think that you are talented and that you are beautiful? Of course I do. But isn't Los Angeles full of actresses who are just as talented, just as beautiful? All right, look, we'll come back to that.",7,Big Bang Theory,210,40
33995,Penny,12," No, please. Don't stop, go on. Tell me how I'm gonna be a waitress for the rest of my life.",7,Big Bang Theory,92,20
33996,Leonard,12," That is not what I said. Look, I think you're really good. I truly do. But this is an incredibly hard thing that you're shooting for. I mean, the odds of anyone becoming a successful actor are like a million to one.",7,Big Bang Theory,216,42
33997,Penny,12," Wow, thank you.",7,Big Bang Theory,16,3
33998,Leonard,12, Should've let Sheldon come.,7,Big Bang Theory,28,4
34000,Sheldon,12," This is interesting. Apparently, a key component in some forms of humour is the element of surprise. ",7,Big Bang Theory,102,17
34001,Amy,12," Well, that makes sense. The prefrontal cortex is responsible for planning and anticipation, and patients with brain lesions on their",7,Big Bang Theory,133,20
34002,Sheldon,12, BRAIN LESIONS!,7,Big Bang Theory,15,2
34003,Amy,12," Sheldon, you scared me. That wasn't funny.",7,Big Bang Theory,43,7
34004,Sheldon,12, Or maybe you have a stick up your prefrontal cortex.,7,Big Bang Theory,53,10
34005,Amy,12," Okay, the notion that you can read a few books and come up with a definitive theory of comedy is absurd. I mean, humour is a complex neurological  Okay, that's pretty good.",7,Big Bang Theory,173,32
34006,Sheldon,12, Excellent.,7,Big Bang Theory,11,1
34009,Raj,12, No. No pretty girls. The point is to talk to regular people and work our way up to pretty girls.,7,Big Bang Theory,97,20
34011,Raj,12," That depends. On any level, do you think she's hot?",7,Big Bang Theory,52,10
34014,Sheldon,12, Kumquat?,7,Big Bang Theory,9,1
34015,Amy,12, I guess.,7,Big Bang Theory,9,2
34016,Sheldon,12, Ointment?,7,Big Bang Theory,10,1
34017,Amy,12, Sure.,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
34018,Sheldon,12," Now, would you say ointment is more, equal to, or less funny than kumquat?",7,Big Bang Theory,75,14
34019,Amy,12, I don't think I want to go out with you anymore.,7,Big Bang Theory,49,11
34020,Sheldon,12, Will you please stop joking around? I'm trying to figure this out.,7,Big Bang Theory,67,12
34021,Amy,12," Sheldon, how many words are you gonna go through?",7,Big Bang Theory,50,9
34022,Sheldon,12, All of them.,7,Big Bang Theory,13,3
34024,Penny,12, You didn't get your part cut.,7,Big Bang Theory,30,6
34026,Penny,12," And you didn't get your part cut. Yep, bunch of old guys rocking out in a band, all with erectile dysfunction, you didn't get your part cut!",7,Big Bang Theory,141,27
34027,Leonard,12, Hey. Can we talk?,7,Big Bang Theory,18,4
34028,Penny,12," We can, but the part of Penny might get cut.",7,Big Bang Theory,45,10
34029,Leonard,12," That was really crappy of me. What you're trying to do is hard, but people do make it, and I really do believe you could be one of them.",7,Big Bang Theory,137,29
34030,Penny,12, Thank you.,7,Big Bang Theory,11,2
34031,Leonard,12," And to show you how much I believe in you, I kind of got you an audition.",7,Big Bang Theory,74,17
34032,Penny,12, Are you serious? For what?,7,Big Bang Theory,27,5
34033,Leonard,12, The new Star Wars movie.,7,Big Bang Theory,25,5
34034,Penny,12, What? How did you manage that?,7,Big Bang Theory,31,6
34035,Leonard,12," There's this thing online, you put yourself on tape and just send it in, anyone can do it.",7,Big Bang Theory,91,18
34036,Penny,12," Come on Leonard, this is just a PR stunt.",7,Big Bang Theory,42,9
34037,Leonard,12," So? Even if it is, you have a huge advantage because you're an actual actress. Most of the people doing this are just weirdoes and nerds. Wolowitz sent his in two days ago.",7,Big Bang Theory,173,33
34038,Penny,12," Really, let it go.",7,Big Bang Theory,19,4
34039,Leonard,12," Look, maybe it is a long shot, but sometimes long shots happen. Luke Skywalker was only given one chance to destroy the Death Star. He had to get a torpedo into an exhaust port that was only two meters wide, but with the help of The Force, he wow, I can feel you hating me right now.",7,Big Bang Theory,284,57
34042,Raj,12," Yeah, she seems friendly and easy to never mind, she's gone. You know, maybe talking to people is too hard.",7,Big Bang Theory,108,20
34044,Raj,12," I don't know. They're dressed very stylishly. They're probably stuck-up. This is ridiculous. The next person that walks by, no matter who it is, they're the one. We're gonna die here.",7,Big Bang Theory,184,31
34046,Amy,12, Hello.,7,Big Bang Theory,7,1
34048,Howard,12, Where's Sheldon?,7,Big Bang Theory,17,2
34049,Amy,12, He's home trying to use science to determine the basis of humour.,7,Big Bang Theory,66,12
34051,Amy,12," It's exhausting. Do you have any idea how hard it is to laugh at a knock-knock joke that starts with knock-knock-knock, Amy, knock-knock-knock, Amy, knock-knock-knock, Amy?",7,Big Bang Theory,173,26
34053,Howard,12, Fake a laugh? Do you ever do that with me?,7,Big Bang Theory,43,10
34055,Howard,12," Well, I'd be able to tell anyway.",7,Big Bang Theory,34,7
34057,Howard,12," Please, I've made plenty of girls laugh, sometimes just by asking them out.  Yeah? Well, I fake my orgasms.",7,Big Bang Theory,108,19
34059,Leonard,12," Yes, how much for a hundred long-stemmed red roses? Really? How much for three?",7,Big Bang Theory,80,14
34060,Penny,12, Hey.,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
34061,Leonard,12," Yeah, I'll call you back.",7,Big Bang Theory,26,5
34062,Penny,12," Look, I know you were just trying to help with your Star Wars thing. I didn't mean to call it idiotic.",7,Big Bang Theory,103,21
34063,Leonard,12," Well, I don't think you called it idiotic.",7,Big Bang Theory,43,8
34064,Penny,12," Oh. Sorry, I meant to. Anyway, um, I was just upset with myself. I wasn't mad at you. I just feel like everything is falling apart.",7,Big Bang Theory,132,26
34065,Leonard,12, Come on. It's okay.,7,Big Bang Theory,20,4
34066,Penny,12," No, it's not okay. Look at me, okay? I took a temp job as a waitress forever ago, and I'm still doing it. I can't quit, because guess what? I can't do anything else. And I finally get my big break, and it goes away. I'm such a mess.",7,Big Bang Theory,233,49
34067,Leonard,12," No, you're not.",7,Big Bang Theory,16,3
34068,Penny,12," Really? â€˜Cause this morning at Starbucks, a pair of old underwear fell out of my pant leg. And it wasn't the only one in there.",7,Big Bang Theory,130,25
34069,Leonard,12," Okay, listen to me, this is just a minor setback.",7,Big Bang Theory,50,10
34070,Penny,12," No, it's not, okay? I've been out here for, like, ten years. I've nothing to show for it.",7,Big Bang Theory,90,18
34071,Leonard,12," Well, you have me.",7,Big Bang Theory,19,4
34072,Penny,12, You're right. I do have you. Mm. Let's get married.,7,Big Bang Theory,52,10
34073,Leonard,12, What?,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
34074,Penny,12," Ooh. Leonard Hofstadter, will you marry me?",7,Big Bang Theory,44,7
34075,Leonard,12, Um,7,Big Bang Theory,3,1
34076,Penny,12, Did you seriously just say um?,7,Big Bang Theory,31,6
34077,Leonard,12," Look, you know I love you but, but you're, you're drunk and sad and feeling lost.",7,Big Bang Theory,82,16
34078,Penny,12," Okay, so, so you don't want to marry me?",7,Big Bang Theory,41,9
34079,Leonard,12, That is not what I said.,7,Big Bang Theory,25,6
34080,Penny,12," No, forget it. I take it back. Offer's off the table.",7,Big Bang Theory,54,11
34081,Sheldon,12, Who's in the mood to laugh?,7,Big Bang Theory,28,6
34082,Leonard,12, Really not a good time.,7,Big Bang Theory,24,5
34083,Sheldon,12, But I used science to construct the perfect joke.,7,Big Bang Theory,50,9
34084,Penny,12, I'm gonna go.,7,Big Bang Theory,14,3
34085,Leonard,12," Penny, don't.",7,Big Bang Theory,14,2
34086,Penny,12," No, no, I just need to be alone.",7,Big Bang Theory,33,8
34087,Sheldon,12," So, a sandwich, a rabbi and yo mama walk into a bar. Where are you going?",7,Big Bang Theory,74,16
34088,Leonard,12, To my room.,7,Big Bang Theory,12,3
34089,Sheldon,12, Should I follow you?,7,Big Bang Theory,21,4
34090,Leonard,12, No.,7,Big Bang Theory,4,1
34091,Sheldon,12," Leonard, wait.",7,Big Bang Theory,15,2
34092,Leonard,12, What?,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
34093,Sheldon,12, I forgot to tell you the sandwich is promiscuous.,7,Big Bang Theory,50,9
34096,Raj,12, That's a mirror.,7,Big Bang Theory,17,3
34099,Raj,12, Sorry.,7,Big Bang Theory,7,1
34101,Raj,12," Uh, excuse me. ",7,Big Bang Theory,16,3
34103,Raj,12," Uh, do, do you like being a mall security guard?",7,Big Bang Theory,49,10
34105,Raj,12," Okay, nice talking to you.",7,Big Bang Theory,27,5
34108,Sheldon,12, Can't sleep?,7,Big Bang Theory,13,2
34109,Leonard,12, No.,7,Big Bang Theory,4,1
34110,Sheldon,12, Would you like to talk about it?,7,Big Bang Theory,33,7
34111,Leonard,12," Penny proposed, and I didn't say yes.",7,Big Bang Theory,38,7
34112,Sheldon,12, Why not?,7,Big Bang Theory,9,2
34113,Leonard,12, That's a good question.,7,Big Bang Theory,24,4
34114,Sheldon,12, Does that mean the relationship is over?,7,Big Bang Theory,41,7
34115,Leonard,12, I don't know.,7,Big Bang Theory,14,3
34116,Sheldon,12, Why don't you ask her?,7,Big Bang Theory,23,5
34117,Leonard,12, Because I'm afraid to know the answer.,7,Big Bang Theory,39,7
34118,Sheldon,12," Well, I'm sorry.",7,Big Bang Theory,17,3
34119,Leonard,12, That's it? You're not gonna make some dumb joke or some inappropriate comment?,7,Big Bang Theory,79,13
34120,Sheldon,12," No. You're my friend, and, I'm sorry.",7,Big Bang Theory,38,7
34121,Leonard,12, Did you just put a kick me sign on my back?,7,Big Bang Theory,44,11
34122,Sheldon,12, No. That wouldn't be funny at all.,7,Big Bang Theory,35,7
34124,Howard,12," Star Wars audition, take one, starring Howard Joel Wolowitz, real-life astronaut. Vader is here, now, on this moon. I felt his presence. He's come for me. He can feel when I'm near",7,Big Bang Theory,181,32
34126,Howard,12, I'm in the middle of something.,7,Big Bang Theory,32,6
34129,Sheldon,13, It's an outrage.,7,Big Bang Theory,17,3
34130,Leonard,13, I know.,7,Big Bang Theory,8,2
34131,Sheldon,13," The university, they think they can do whatever they want. We just have to sit there and take it.",7,Big Bang Theory,98,19
34132,Leonard,13," You need to let it go, Sheldon.",7,Big Bang Theory,32,7
34133,Sheldon,13," You work tirelessly for someone, and this is what you get.",7,Big Bang Theory,59,11
34134,Leonard,13," Oh, my God, they're just making you use your vacation days.",7,Big Bang Theory,60,11
34135,Sheldon,13, But I don't want a vacation.,7,Big Bang Theory,29,6
34136,Leonard,13," Okay, listen, I don't mean to diminish what you're going through, but I'm a little distracted right now.",7,Big Bang Theory,105,18
34137,Sheldon,13," Oh, this again? So, Penny proposed, you didn't say yes, and now you think you may have lost her love forever. How does this compare to me being forced to relax for a few days?",7,Big Bang Theory,176,35
34138,Leonard,13, It doesn't.,7,Big Bang Theory,12,2
34139,Sheldon,13, Thank you.,7,Big Bang Theory,11,2
34140,Leonard,13, I'm gonna go talk to Penny. ,7,Big Bang Theory,29,6
34141,Sheldon,13," I'm going to go inside, put on my coziest pajamas, curl up with a good book and wait for this nightmare to be over.  Penny. Sorry.",7,Big Bang Theory,131,26
34142,Penny,13, Hi.,7,Big Bang Theory,4,1
34143,Leonard,13, Hey.,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1

34148,Penny,13, Leonard,7,Big Bang Theory,8,1
34149,Leonard,13," No, no, no, no. I take it back. Don't say it. Just, just hate me, but stay with me. It worked for my parents.",7,Big Bang Theory,110,24
34150,Penny,13," Listen, I don't want to break up with you.",7,Big Bang Theory,43,9
34151,Leonard,13," Oh. Oh, okay. Good, good. So, it's cool if I cry a little?",7,Big Bang Theory,59,13
34152,Penny,13," Yeah, I probably wouldn't.",7,Big Bang Theory,27,4
34153,Leonard,13, Yeah.,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
34154,Penny,13," Look, you did the right thing last night. I was a mess. I was just frustrated because my career is going nowhere.",7,Big Bang Theory,114,22
34155,Leonard,13," Look, I get it, and I want you to know that I support whatever you want to do.",7,Big Bang Theory,79,18
34156,Penny,13," Great, because I've been thinking, if I really want this acting thing to work, I need to focus all my energy on it. And to do that, I should quit waitressing at The Cheesecake Factory.",7,Big Bang Theory,185,35
34157,Leonard,13," Wow. That, that's a big step.",7,Big Bang Theory,30,6
34158,Penny,13, I know.,7,Big Bang Theory,8,2
34159,Leonard,13," So, well, before making any rash",7,Big Bang Theory,33,6
34160,Penny,13, I already quit.,7,Big Bang Theory,16,3
34161,Leonard,13, And I support you.,7,Big Bang Theory,19,4
34163,Sheldon,13," Come on, take me to work with you.",7,Big Bang Theory,35,8
34164,Leonard,13, No. You're on vacation.,7,Big Bang Theory,24,4
34165,Sheldon,13, Please. What if there's a big breakthrough in science today and I'm not there to see it?,7,Big Bang Theory,89,17
34166,Leonard,13, Do you really think there's gonna be a breakthrough without you there to do it?,7,Big Bang Theory,80,15
34167,Sheldon,13, No. I was just tricking you.,7,Big Bang Theory,29,6
34168,Leonard,13, Bye.,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
34169,Sheldon,13," Leonard, wait. Take me with you.",7,Big Bang Theory,33,6

34173,Sheldon,13, Too bad. I'm coming with you.,7,Big Bang Theory,30,6
34174,Leonard,13," Oh, Sheldon, stay.",7,Big Bang Theory,19,3
34175,Sheldon,13, But.,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
34176,Leonard,13, I said stay. I'm going to work. Do not follow me. ,7,Big Bang Theory,51,11

34196,Howard,13, Anybody home?,7,Big Bang Theory,14,2
34197,Amy,13," Hey, what brings you guys here?",7,Big Bang Theory,32,6
34198,Raj,13," Well, we were just on our way to lunch and wanted to see if you'd like to join.",7,Big Bang Theory,80,18
34199,Amy,13," Why? Because Sheldon's not here this week, and you don't think I have any other options? I'm just kidding. I'll get my purse.",7,Big Bang Theory,126,23
34201,Amy,13," That's okay. Uh, Bert, this is Howard and Rajesh. Guys, this is Bert.",7,Big Bang Theory,70,13
34202,Howard,13, Hi.,7,Big Bang Theory,4,1
34203,Raj,13, Hey. Good to see you.,7,Big Bang Theory,22,5
34205,Amy,13, This is so pretty. Bert works for the geology department.,7,Big Bang Theory,58,10
34207,Howard,13, You're both into rock?,7,Big Bang Theory,23,4
34209,Amy,13," Oh, you forgot your quartz.",7,Big Bang Theory,28,5
34211,Amy,13, He's nice.,7,Big Bang Theory,11,2
34212,Howard,13," Yeah, he's nice because he likes you.",7,Big Bang Theory,38,7
34213,Amy,13," What?! No, he doesn't.",7,Big Bang Theory,23,4
34214,Raj,13, He brought you a pretty rock.,7,Big Bang Theory,30,6
34215,Amy,13, So? He does that every day. Oh.,7,Big Bang Theory,32,7
34216,Howard,13," You know, if you'd rather skip lunch and hang out with your boyfriend Bert, it's totally okay.",7,Big Bang Theory,95,17
34217,Amy,13, He's not my boyfriend.,7,Big Bang Theory,23,4
34218,Raj,13," Are you sure? He's tall, pale and awkward. That sounds like your type.",7,Big Bang Theory,71,13
34219,Amy,13, Should someone as lonely as you really be making fun of me?,7,Big Bang Theory,60,12
34220,Raj,13," Yeah, grow up, Howard. God.",7,Big Bang Theory,28,5
34221,Amy,13, What do I do? I don't want to hurt his feelings.,7,Big Bang Theory,49,11
34222,Howard,13, Maybe the problem is he thinks you're available. Does he know you're dating Sheldon?,7,Big Bang Theory,85,14
34223,Amy,13, I guess it hasn't come up.,7,Big Bang Theory,27,6
34224,Howard,13, There you go. ,7,Big Bang Theory,15,3
34225,Raj,13, And does Sheldon know you're dating Sheldon?,7,Big Bang Theory,45,7
34226,Amy,13, I'm sorry. Who are you dating?,7,Big Bang Theory,31,6
34227,Raj,13," Yeah, knock it off, Howard.",7,Big Bang Theory,28,5

34230,Sheldon,13, Hello.,7,Big Bang Theory,7,1
34231,Penny,13, You okay?,7,Big Bang Theory,10,2
34232,Sheldon,13, I'm on vacation. What do you think?,7,Big Bang Theory,36,7
34233,Penny,13, Why are you sitting in the stairwell?,7,Big Bang Theory,38,7
34234,Sheldon,13, Leonard told me to stay.,7,Big Bang Theory,25,5
34235,Penny,13," Oh. Well, good boy.",7,Big Bang Theory,20,4
34236,Sheldon,13, Where are you going?,7,Big Bang Theory,21,4
34237,Penny,13," Oh, I have a ton of errands to run. I need to make copies of my headshot, send them off to agents and sign up for a new acting class.",7,Big Bang Theory,134,30
34238,Sheldon,13," Well, have fun.",7,Big Bang Theory,16,3
34239,Penny,13, Okay. You want to come with me?,7,Big Bang Theory,32,7

34250,Amy,13, Penny really quit The Cheesecake Factory?,7,Big Bang Theory,42,6
34251,Leonard,13, Yeah.,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
34252,Howard,13," So, what is she doing today?",7,Big Bang Theory,29,6
34253,Leonard,13," I don't know. She already thinks I don't support this, so if I call, it might look like I'm checking up on her.",7,Big Bang Theory,112,23
34254,Raj,13," Well, do you support this?",7,Big Bang Theory,27,5
34255,Leonard,13, Of course I do. She's a great actress. I'm proud she's taking this risk.,7,Big Bang Theory,73,14
34256,Amy,13, That's nice.,7,Big Bang Theory,13,2
34257,Leonard,13, You bought that? Great. I got to call her before I forget how I said it. Hey.,7,Big Bang Theory,78,17
34258,Penny,13, Hi. What's up?,7,Big Bang Theory,15,3
34259,Leonard,13," Oh, how's it going? You taking Hollywood by storm?",7,Big Bang Theory,51,9
34260,Penny,13," Actually, I'm at The Cheesecake Factory.",7,Big Bang Theory,41,6
34261,Leonard,13," You got your job back. That is great news. I didn't want to say anything, but you are making the right choice. To plunge yourself into debt right now would be literally insane.",7,Big Bang Theory,177,33
34262,Penny,13, Yeah. I'm just returning my uniform.,7,Big Bang Theory,37,6
34263,Leonard,13, And I support you.,7,Big Bang Theory,19,4
34266,Sheldon,13, Okay. I'm inside the CERN super collider.,7,Big Bang Theory,42,7
34268,Sheldon,13, Wow. Didn't see that coming.,7,Big Bang Theory,29,5
34270,Sheldon,13, Let me guess.,7,Big Bang Theory,14,3
34272,Sheldon,13, What was I gonna do? Two ins in a row? Where's my lemonade?,7,Big Bang Theory,60,13
34273,Penny,13, I didn't get it.,7,Big Bang Theory,17,4
34274,Sheldon,13," A fitting swan song to your career as a waitress, to forget my order one last time.",7,Big Bang Theory,84,17
34275,Penny,13, Do you think quitting my job was a mistake?,7,Big Bang Theory,44,9
34276,Sheldon,13, Do you see me drinking lemonade?,7,Big Bang Theory,33,6
34277,Penny,13, No. I'm serious.,7,Big Bang Theory,17,3
34278,Sheldon,13, Why do you ask?,7,Big Bang Theory,16,4
34279,Penny,13, Because Leonard just pissed me off. Am I being an idiot or not?,7,Big Bang Theory,64,13
34280,Sheldon,13," No, I don't think you are. ",7,Big Bang Theory,28,6
34281,Penny,13, Really?,7,Big Bang Theory,8,1
34282,Sheldon,13," The best way to achieve a goal is to devote 100% of your time and energy to it. When I decided I was going to be a physicist, I didn't take some other job in case it didn't work out. Which wasn't easy because there was a lot of pressure from Ms. Pearson for me to be chalk monitor that year.",7,Big Bang Theory,292,61
34283,Penny,13, Thank you. I needed to hear that. Why can't Leonard understand it?,7,Big Bang Theory,67,12
34284,Sheldon,13," Because he's not like us, Penny. We're dreamers.",7,Big Bang Theory,49,8
34285,Penny,13," Yeah, I need to start cracking the window when I leave you in the car.",7,Big Bang Theory,71,15
34288,Amy,13," Hello, Bert.",7,Big Bang Theory,13,2
34290,Amy,13," Listen, um, Bert, before you say anything else, I, I have a boyfriend.",7,Big Bang Theory,71,13
34292,Amy,13, Weren't you?,7,Big Bang Theory,13,2
34294,Amy,13," That's very nice of you, but I do have a boyfriend.",7,Big Bang Theory,52,11
34296,Amy,13," No, that's not true. My boyfriend has an off-putting personality, too. Like, way worse than you.",7,Big Bang Theory,97,16
34298,Amy,13, Don't say that. ,7,Big Bang Theory,17,3
34300,Amy,13," No, Bert, come on. I'd love to go to the mineral show with you.",7,Big Bang Theory,64,14
34302,Amy,13," No, it's not.",7,Big Bang Theory,14,3
34329,Howard,13, The mineral and rock show? That would be awful even without Bert.,7,Big Bang Theory,66,12
34330,Amy,13, So what am I supposed to do now?,7,Big Bang Theory,33,8
34331,Raj,13, Prepare your uterus for his gigantic offspring?,7,Big Bang Theory,48,7
34332,Amy,13," This isn't funny. I'm gonna have to tell him the truth, that even if I didn't have a boyfriend, I wouldn't be interested in him.",7,Big Bang Theory,129,25
34333,Howard,13," Oh, I've heard those words so many times. From Linda Nosenchuck, Tammy Rosenworcel.",7,Big Bang Theory,84,13
34334,Raj,13," Padma Kapur, Neha Chowdury.",7,Big Bang Theory,28,4
34335,Howard,13," Marci Grossman, Lisa Mazzarino.",7,Big Bang Theory,32,4
34336,Raj,13, Megan Pincus.,7,Big Bang Theory,14,2
34337,Howard,13, Tammy Cho.,7,Big Bang Theory,11,2
34338,Raj,13," Oh, who was that girl from our Starbucks?",7,Big Bang Theory,42,8
34339,Howard,13, Arlene Russel.,7,Big Bang Theory,15,2
34340,Raj,13, Yes. Arlene. She wrote no way on both our cappuccinos.,7,Big Bang Theory,55,10
34341,Howard,13, Poor Bert. That guy's got a rough afternoon ahead of him.,7,Big Bang Theory,58,11
34342,Amy,13," Well, how would you want a girl to tell you she wasn't interested?",7,Big Bang Theory,67,13
34343,Raj,13," I guess, uh, I'd like her to sit me down, look me in the eye and say, I was wrong. I love you. And then maybe she could touch me in a special way.",7,Big Bang Theory,147,34
34344,Howard,13, That's how you reject a guy.,7,Big Bang Theory,29,6
34345,Amy,13," Okay, I don't have time for this. I'm just gonna go find him and be brutally honest.",7,Big Bang Theory,85,17
34346,Howard,13," No, don't.",7,Big Bang Theory,11,2
34347,Raj,13, He'll be so upset. He'll probably climb up the Empire State Building and start swatting at planes.,7,Big Bang Theory,99,17
34348,Howard,13, You want us to talk to him?,7,Big Bang Theory,28,7
34349,Amy,13, Really? You would do that?,7,Big Bang Theory,27,5
34350,Raj,13, Sure. We've both been in his shoes. We'll let him down with compassion and respect.,7,Big Bang Theory,84,15
34351,Amy,13, Thank you.,7,Big Bang Theory,11,2
34352,Howard,13, Let's go.,7,Big Bang Theory,10,2
34353,Raj,13," So we tell him she's a lesbian, right?",7,Big Bang Theory,39,8
34354,Howard,13, Of course we tell him she's a lesbian.,7,Big Bang Theory,39,8
34356,Penny,13," And hold three, two, one. Very good. Now let's try Warrior 2. And hold.",7,Big Bang Theory,72,14
34357,Sheldon,13, I've read that there are great yogis who have such mastery over their bodies they can draw water in through their genitals.,7,Big Bang Theory,124,22
34358,Penny,13," Yeah, well, I don't think we're gonna get to do that today.",7,Big Bang Theory,60,12
34359,Sheldon,13, Too bad. It seems like a good way to drink a milk shake without getting brain freeze.,7,Big Bang Theory,86,17
34360,Leonard,13," Oh, hey.",7,Big Bang Theory,9,2
34361,Penny,13, And now we go to Reverse Warrior.,7,Big Bang Theory,34,7
34362,Leonard,13, How did she get you to do yoga?,7,Big Bang Theory,32,8
34363,Sheldon,13," Well, to be honest, I thought she said Yoda.",7,Big Bang Theory,45,9
34364,Penny,13," I'm helping him relax because, unlike you, he supports me.",7,Big Bang Theory,59,10
34365,Leonard,13," Oh, how many times do I have to say it? I support you.",7,Big Bang Theory,55,13
34366,Penny,13," Sheldon, take a break.",7,Big Bang Theory,23,4
34367,Sheldon,13, Namaste.,7,Big Bang Theory,9,1
34368,Penny,13," Okay, if you support me, what was with that phone call?",7,Big Bang Theory,56,11
34369,Leonard,13," Fine. I'm not sure you should have quit. But if you care so much what I think, why didn't you ask me before you did it?",7,Big Bang Theory,120,26
34370,Penny,13," Oh, so now I need your permission? Would you have asked me before you quit your job?",7,Big Bang Theory,85,17
34371,Leonard,13," Yes. I thought we were in the kind of relationship where we make decisions together. If I'm wrong, then maybe we need to talk about the kind of relationship we're actually in.",7,Big Bang Theory,176,32
34372,Penny,13," Yeah, well, maybe we do.",7,Big Bang Theory,25,5
34373,Sheldon,13, I'm willing to if you guys are.,7,Big Bang Theory,32,7
34374,Leonard,13, Can we please have some privacy?,7,Big Bang Theory,33,6
34375,Sheldon,13," Y, No. I'm as much a part of this relationship as you two, and I think it's high time we put all our cards on the table. For example, where is this going? Are you two ever getting married? And, if so, where will we all live? Have you thought about that?",7,Big Bang Theory,254,52
34376,Leonard,13, No.,7,Big Bang Theory,4,1
34377,Sheldon,13, Penny?,7,Big Bang Theory,7,1
34378,Penny,13," Okay, wait. What are we doing?",7,Big Bang Theory,31,6
34379,Leonard,13," For some reason, we're planning a future where we both live with Sheldon forever.",7,Big Bang Theory,82,14
34380,Sheldon,13, Good. Now we're getting somewhere.,7,Big Bang Theory,35,5
34381,Penny,13," Look, I know you think I'm being reckless, and you might be right, but I need to take this shot.",7,Big Bang Theory,97,20
34382,Sheldon,13," Yeah, no kidding. Despite what it says on her rÃ©sumÃ©, she is no longer 22. ",7,Big Bang Theory,78,15
34383,Leonard,13," I swear, I am on your side. ",7,Big Bang Theory,29,7
34384,Penny,13," You keep saying you're on my side, but you don't act like it.",7,Big Bang Theory,62,13
34385,Sheldon,13," He does that to me, too. Why do we put up with it?",7,Big Bang Theory,51,13
34386,Leonard,13," Listen, I could never do what you're doing, okay? I would be terrified.",7,Big Bang Theory,72,13
34387,Penny,13," Well, it's scary for me, too.",7,Big Bang Theory,30,6
34388,Sheldon,13, I'm fine with it.,7,Big Bang Theory,18,4
34389,Leonard,13," My point is, just because I couldn't do it doesn't mean you shouldn't. And I'm proud of you. ",7,Big Bang Theory,94,18
34390,Penny,13, Okay. Thank you.,7,Big Bang Theory,17,3
34391,Sheldon,13," Well, to celebrate this reconciliation, let's all share a milk shake. Uh, Penny, you'll need a straw.",7,Big Bang Theory,102,17
34401,Raj,13, We're sorry Amy didn't want to go.,7,Big Bang Theory,35,7
34402,Howard,13," Really, really sorry.",7,Big Bang Theory,22,3
34405,Howard,14, T-minus 60 seconds.,7,Big Bang Theory,20,3
34406,Raj,14," Oh, it all comes down to this.",7,Big Bang Theory,31,7
34407,Leonard,14," Oh, I've got butterflies.",7,Big Bang Theory,26,4
34408,Sheldon,14," Don't get soft on me, Hofstadter. I will slap those glasses right off your face.",7,Big Bang Theory,81,15
34409,Penny,14, What's going on?,7,Big Bang Theory,17,3
34410,Leonard,14, Hey. We're about to buy tickets for Comic-Con.,7,Big Bang Theory,47,8
34411,Penny,14, Oh.,7,Big Bang Theory,4,1
34412,Howard,14, T Minus 45 seconds.,7,Big Bang Theory,20,4
34413,Leonard,14," They sell out incredibly fast, but as long as one of us gets in, we can buy passes",7,Big Bang Theory,83,18
34414,Sheldon,14," Good Lord, this is not the time for flirting, keep it in your pants.",7,Big Bang Theory,69,14
34415,Penny,14, This is a whole lot of weird before coffee.,7,Big Bang Theory,44,9
34416,Howard,14, T-minus 30 seconds.,7,Big Bang Theory,20,3
34417,Raj,14," Oh, I have to go to the bathroom so bad.",7,Big Bang Theory,41,10
34418,Sheldon,14," Every year. I told you, wear a diaper.",7,Big Bang Theory,39,8
34419,Raj,14, And I told you I get diaper rash.,7,Big Bang Theory,34,8
34420,Howard,14, 15 seconds.,7,Big Bang Theory,12,2
34421,Leonard,14," Well, this is it, this is it. This is it.",7,Big Bang Theory,42,10
34422,Howard,14," Five, four, three, two, one. ",7,Big Bang Theory,30,5
34423,Sheldon,14," It's live. Go, go, go, go, go.",7,Big Bang Theory,31,7
34424,Raj,14, Anyone in?,7,Big Bang Theory,11,2
34425,Sheldon,14, No.,7,Big Bang Theory,4,1
34426,Leonard,14, Not yet. ,7,Big Bang Theory,10,2
34427,Howard,14, Nope.,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
34428,Sheldon,14, Do not stop refreshing your screens.,7,Big Bang Theory,37,6
34430,Penny,14," Yeah, this is not gonna be enough coffee.",7,Big Bang Theory,42,8
34433,Howard,14, It's been ten minutes. We're running out of time.,7,Big Bang Theory,50,9
34434,Penny,14, To be cool? Yeah.,7,Big Bang Theory,18,4
34435,Leonard,14," I did it, I did it, I'm in the queue.",7,Big Bang Theory,38,10
34436,Sheldon,14, Yay! And they say firefighters are the real heroes.,7,Big Bang Theory,52,9
34437,Raj,14," Uh, what number in line are you?",7,Big Bang Theory,33,7
34438,Leonard,14," Uh, fifteen",7,Big Bang Theory,12,2
34439,Howard,14, Great.,7,Big Bang Theory,7,1
34440,Leonard,14, thousand two hundred and eleven.,7,Big Bang Theory,33,5
34441,Howard,14, Damn.,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
34442,Raj,14," Oh, they only have Thursday and Sunday passes left.",7,Big Bang Theory,52,9
34443,Howard,14, Really?,7,Big Bang Theory,8,1
34444,Leonard,14," Oh, Thursday's gone. Just Sunday left.",7,Big Bang Theory,39,6
34445,Sheldon,14," Oh, Sunday's the worst. Everybody's leaving, most of the good panels are over, and the only T-shirts they have left are small and XXXXL.",7,Big Bang Theory,137,24
34446,Leonard,14, Sunday's gone.,7,Big Bang Theory,15,2
34447,Sheldon,14," Not Sunday, I love Sunday.",7,Big Bang Theory,27,5
34448,Raj,14, So that's it? Everything's sold out?,7,Big Bang Theory,37,6
34449,Leonard,14, Yeah.,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
34450,Howard,14, I can't believe we're not going.,7,Big Bang Theory,33,6
34451,Sheldon,14," It's okay. You know, there, there's always WonderCon in Anaheim, you know? That, that's just as good. Excuse me.",7,Big Bang Theory,113,19
34452,Penny,14," Oh, guys, this is really sad. And in a different way than it was twenty minutes ago.",7,Big Bang Theory,85,17
34453,Sheldon,14, I can't believe we wasted all that time on our Hulk costumes.,7,Big Bang Theory,62,12
34454,Penny,14, What? You were all going as the Hulk?,7,Big Bang Theory,38,8
34455,Howard,14," Not the same Hulk. Ferrigno, Bana, Norton and Ruffalo.",7,Big Bang Theory,55,9
34456,Raj,14, We would have been the angry green belles of the masquerade ball.,7,Big Bang Theory,66,12
34458,Penny,14, And we're back to the first kind of sad.,7,Big Bang Theory,41,9
34460,Sheldon,14," Gentlemen, I have the solution to our Comic-Con problem. We don't need them. I'm starting my own convention.",7,Big Bang Theory,109,18
34461,Leonard,14," Sheldon, just buy scalped tickets with us.",7,Big Bang Theory,43,7
34462,Sheldon,14," I told you. Buying scalped tickets is against the rules. If you get caught, you get banned from Comic-Con for life. Life, Leonard. You're gonna feel pretty silly when we're 80 years old, and you have to drive me down there and then wait in the car for three days.",7,Big Bang Theory,264,50
34463,Leonard,14, Do what you want. We're getting scalped tickets.,7,Big Bang Theory,49,8
34464,Howard,14, I already found a guy online who's willing to sell.,7,Big Bang Theory,52,10
34465,Sheldon,14, How do you know this isn't a sting operation set up by the Comic-Con police?,7,Big Bang Theory,77,15
34466,Leonard,14, The same way I know that the people in the TV set can't see me.,7,Big Bang Theory,64,15
34467,Howard,14," Sheldon, just come with us. You're not gonna make your own convention.",7,Big Bang Theory,71,12
34468,Sheldon,14," You know, there was a time when Comic-Con didn't exist at all until one lone dreamer with a unique vision made it happen. And you mark my words, I'm gonna rip that guy off.",7,Big Bang Theory,173,34
34470,Sheldon,14," Yes, I'm starting my own comic book convention, and I thought that your client, Robert Downey Jr., would be perfect to appear on our first panel. Oh, well, now, why are you saying no? You haven't even asked him yet. You know, excuse me, but I sat through Iron Man 2. I believe he owes me two hours of his time. They hung up on me.",7,Big Bang Theory,331,66
34471,Leonard,14," Did you tell them that you're holding your convention at a Marie Callender's, and that every panellist gets a free slice of pie?",7,Big Bang Theory,129,23
34472,Sheldon,14, I didn't even get to that part.,7,Big Bang Theory,32,7
34473,Leonard,14," Look, even your friend Wil Wheaton thinks this is a waste of time.",7,Big Bang Theory,67,13
34474,Sheldon,14," Not true. Wil thinks this is a great idea. He was just concerned that he wasn't a big enough celebrity to headline such an amazing event. Also, that's the same day that he shampoos his beard.",7,Big Bang Theory,192,36
34475,Leonard,14," Sheldon, buddy, I just don't think this is going to come together for you.",7,Big Bang Theory,75,14
34476,Sheldon,14, You don't know that. I still have plenty of solid leads on this list.,7,Big Bang Theory,70,14
34477,Leonard,14, Good luck.,7,Big Bang Theory,11,2
34478,Sheldon,14," No, wait. I need you to call Stan Lee, Leonard Nimoy and Bill Nye the Science Guy, 'cause, legally, I'm not allowed to. Oh, and, also, Carrie Fisher, you know, 'cause I hear he can be pretty nuts.",7,Big Bang Theory,197,38
34480,Penny,14, I can't believe Leonard is spending hundreds of dollars on scalped tickets. ,7,Big Bang Theory,77,12
34481,Amy,14," Last week, you spent that on a little dress. ",7,Big Bang Theory,46,9
34482,Penny,14," Yeah, but those tickets only get him into Comic-Con. That dress gets me into anywhere I want.",7,Big Bang Theory,94,17
34484,Amy,14," Why can't they do something sensible like Sheldon and start their own comic book convention? Also, who wants to throw me out that window?",7,Big Bang Theory,138,24
34486,Amy,14, Oh. You mean like a museum?,7,Big Bang Theory,28,6
34487,Penny,14," Yes, like a museum, but anything else.",7,Big Bang Theory,39,7
34489,Amy,14," Ooh, afternoon tea, how sophisticated of us.",7,Big Bang Theory,45,7
34490,Penny,14," Oh, all right, if we're gonna be fancy, I should probably put on clean underwear.",7,Big Bang Theory,82,15
34492,Penny,14," No, we're gonna stop at Target on the way.",7,Big Bang Theory,43,9
34494,Raj,14," Hey, since Sheldon's not going to Comic-Con, maybe we could find a cool trio to dress up as.",7,Big Bang Theory,93,18
34495,Leonard,14," Mmm, what if we go as The Fantastic Four, and just tell people that the Invisible Girl is standing there with us.",7,Big Bang Theory,114,22
34496,Howard,14," Oh, and I thought our days of pretending to be with women who don't exist were over.",7,Big Bang Theory,85,17
34497,Sheldon,14," Gentlemen, I am one step away from securing a huge guest for my convention.",7,Big Bang Theory,76,14
34498,Leonard,14, Does that step include chloroform and a roll of duct tape?,7,Big Bang Theory,59,11
34499,Sheldon,14," I don't think that will be necessary for Mr. James Earl Jones. You heard me. The voice of Darth Vader, the Lion King's dad, and FYI, the guy who says, This is CNN. Which also sounds like Darth Vader.",7,Big Bang Theory,200,39
34500,Raj,14, How are you gonna get James Earl Jones?,7,Big Bang Theory,40,8
34501,Sheldon,14," Simple. Earlier today, he tweeted that he's looking forward to going to his favourite sushi restaurant for dinner. I googled an interview from four years ago which was conducted in his favourite sushi restaurant. That's where he'll be, and that's where I'm going, and",7,Big Bang Theory,268,44
34502,Howard,14, And that's where Darth Vader's gonna pour soy sauce on your head.,7,Big Bang Theory,66,12
34503,Leonard,14," Sheldon, I don't care if you get scalped tickets with us or not, but please don't be creepy and go stalking this poor guy. You're gonna get in trouble.",7,Big Bang Theory,152,29
34504,Sheldon,14," You're the ones who are going to get in trouble. You're buying non-transferable tickets. And from a stranger, no less. Not only can you get banned from Comic-Con, if caught, you could be charged with petty theft. You think about that while I'm warning James Earl Jones about the danger of posting his location on Twitter. He got lucky this time. There are some weirdoes out there.  Bom, bom, bom, bom, badum, bom, badum. Bom, bom, bom, bom, badum, bom, badum. Bom, bom, badala, baba, badalum, bom, badala, bom, bom, forgot my keys, bom, bom, bom, bom, badum, bom, badum ",7,Big Bang Theory,571,100
34506,Howard,14," Okay, great. Bye. Our friendly neighbourhood scalper says he's running late.",7,Big Bang Theory,77,11
34507,Raj,14, Does he sound like a criminal?,7,Big Bang Theory,31,6
34508,Howard,14, What do you mean?,7,Big Bang Theory,18,4
34509,Raj,14," You know, did he say things like, youse guys, or, listen here, see?",7,Big Bang Theory,68,13
34510,Leonard,14," Yes. He, he's late because he's on his way here from 1940.",7,Big Bang Theory,59,12
34511,Raj,14," I'm just saying, we don't know who this guy is. What if he wants to steal our money or our kidneys, or make a suit outof our skins?",7,Big Bang Theory,132,28
34512,Howard,14, Why would someone want to make clothes out of your skin?,7,Big Bang Theory,57,11
34513,Raj,14, I don't know. Maybe 'cause dark doesn't show the stains?,7,Big Bang Theory,57,10
34514,Leonard,14," Well, now you're making me wonder if we should have met him at a neutral location.",7,Big Bang Theory,83,16
34515,Howard,14, Why do you think I told him to come to your place?,7,Big Bang Theory,51,12
34517,Amy,14, There sure are a lot of little kids here.,7,Big Bang Theory,42,9
34518,Penny,14, I can't believe we thought this would makes us feel grown up.,7,Big Bang Theory,62,12
34520,Amy,14," Well, last time I got dressed up and had tea was when I was five. Just me, my teddy bear, Raggedy Ann and my hamster. ",7,Big Bang Theory,119,25
34522,Amy,14, It was. Till my hamster ate all her babies. It got less cute really fast.,7,Big Bang Theory,74,15
34524,Penny,14," Well, there's a bar in the lobby.",7,Big Bang Theory,34,7
34526,Amy,14," Aw. Drinking in the afternoon, just like her mommy.",7,Big Bang Theory,52,9
34529,Sheldon,14," Thank you. My friend Leonard said if I bothered you while you were eating, you'd think I was a creepy stalker.",7,Big Bang Theory,111,21
34531,Sheldon,14," He is, Mr. Earl Jones, he is.",7,Big Bang Theory,30,7
34533,Raj,14," Okay, so, I'm on a Comic-Con message board, and there's a post from a guy where he says he got caught using someone else's badge, and Sheldon was right, he did get charged with petty theft. Guys, if I go to jail dressed as the Human Torch, that might send the wrong message.",7,Big Bang Theory,275,53
34534,Leonard,14, Maybe this isn't a good idea.,7,Big Bang Theory,30,6
34535,Howard,14, I can text the guy and tell him we changed our minds.,7,Big Bang Theory,54,12
34536,Raj,14, Do it.,7,Big Bang Theory,7,2
34537,Howard,14, Okay. We're officially not going to Comic-Con.,7,Big Bang Theory,47,7
34538,Leonard,14, Hold on. We always do this. ,7,Big Bang Theory,29,6
34539,Howard,14, Do what?,7,Big Bang Theory,9,2
34540,Leonard,14," Chicken out. We're, we're so afraid of getting into trouble that we never do anything wrong.",7,Big Bang Theory,93,16
34541,Raj,14, That's 'cause we're the good guys.,7,Big Bang Theory,35,6
34542,Leonard,14, Even Batman breaks the rules. ,7,Big Bang Theory,31,5
34543,Raj,14, You know I struggle with Batman.,7,Big Bang Theory,33,6
34544,Leonard,14," I say, this one time, instead of wimping out, let's be badasses.",7,Big Bang Theory,65,12
34545,Raj,14," Okay, I'll be a badass, but only if you pinky-swear to be one, too.",7,Big Bang Theory,68,14
34546,Leonard,14," Howard, you in on this?",7,Big Bang Theory,24,5
34547,Howard,14, No need. I'm breaking rules all the time. ,7,Big Bang Theory,43,8
34548,Leonard,14, Name one.,7,Big Bang Theory,10,2
34549,Howard,14, Last night. Drank my Pepto straight out of the bottle.,7,Big Bang Theory,55,10
34550,Raj,14, What about that little cup they give you?,7,Big Bang Theory,42,8
34551,Howard,14, Yeah. What about it?,7,Big Bang Theory,21,4
34552,Raj,14, Are you impressed by that?,7,Big Bang Theory,27,5
34553,Leonard,14, A little.,7,Big Bang Theory,10,2
34554,Raj,14," Yeah, me, too.",7,Big Bang Theory,15,3
34557,Sheldon,14," Me, too. But he wasn't, was he?",7,Big Bang Theory,32,7
34559,Sheldon,14, So messed up.,7,Big Bang Theory,14,3
34562,Penny,14," So, afternoon tea was a bust.",7,Big Bang Theory,30,6
34563,Amy,14," On the bright side, every six-year-old there was jealous of my tiara. Not gonna lie, it felt good.",7,Big Bang Theory,99,18
34564,Penny,14," Let me ask you a question, when did you guys start feeling grown up? â€˜Cause I am not sure I do.",7,Big Bang Theory,98,21
34566,Penny,14," Okay, so I'm an adult, and the other day I saw an old man slip and fall down, and I laughed. I mean, I laughed hard. Like, like, out loud. If he was conscious, he would've heard me.",7,Big Bang Theory,182,38
34567,Amy,14, Gosh.,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
34568,Penny,14," I know. One of the tennis balls came off his walker and bounced right off his head. I mean, I, I almost wet myself. I guess you had to be there.",7,Big Bang Theory,145,31
34569,Amy,14, I think I have you both beat. Imagine trying to feel like a grown-up when you've never even been with a man.,7,Big Bang Theory,109,22
34570,Penny,14," Okay, sex is not what makes you a grown-up.",7,Big Bang Theory,44,9
34572,Penny,14, Really? Is that how you talk to your mother?,7,Big Bang Theory,45,9
34574,Howard,14, He just parked. He's on his way up.,7,Big Bang Theory,36,8
34575,Leonard,14, Good. This is exciting.,7,Big Bang Theory,24,4
34576,Raj,14, It is. I feel alive.,7,Big Bang Theory,21,5
34577,Leonard,14," Yeah. What if we do get caught, who cares? So we get banned from Comic-Con.",7,Big Bang Theory,76,15
34578,Raj,14, Maybe slapped with a fine.,7,Big Bang Theory,27,5
34579,Howard,14," Oh, no. I'd be an astronaut and a bad boy, how will women keep their pants on?",7,Big Bang Theory,79,17
34580,Raj,14," Uh, maybe it'll come up when I apply for citizenship. Oh, crap, what if it comes up when I apply for citizenship? ",7,Big Bang Theory,115,22
34581,Leonard,14, I wonder if we'd have to disclose something like this when we apply for grants.,7,Big Bang Theory,80,15
34582,Raj,14," He's gonna be here any second, what should we do?",7,Big Bang Theory,50,10
34583,Howard,14," Okay, you guys are such babies. I'll handle this. If he thinks we're not home, he'll go away.",7,Big Bang Theory,94,18
34584,Raj,14, I thought you were a badass.,7,Big Bang Theory,29,6
34585,Howard,14," I lied about the Pepto, I always use the little cup.",7,Big Bang Theory,53,11
34587,Sheldon,14," Is it true, as a child, you were a stutterer and were functionally mute for eight years?",7,Big Bang Theory,89,17
34589,Sheldon,14, Oh. Is it true they used scuba gear to create the sound of Darth Vader breathing?,7,Big Bang Theory,82,16
34591,Sheldon,14, Oh. Is it true that you were pre-med in college and you almost became a doctor?,7,Big Bang Theory,80,16
34593,Sheldon,14," Oh, James, I could listen to your stories all night.",7,Big Bang Theory,53,10
34595,Penny,14," I mean, really, what's so great about being grown up?",7,Big Bang Theory,54,10
34597,Penny,14," I'm serious. Who wants to do all that stuff? Have insurance, pay mortgages, leave one of those little notes when you hit a parked car.",7,Big Bang Theory,135,25
34598,Amy,14, I told you it was Penny.,7,Big Bang Theory,25,6
34599,Penny,14," Oh, come on, it wasn't me. Anyone could have knocked your mirror off, or whatever happened.",7,Big Bang Theory,92,16
34600,Amy,14," Maybe the guys are right. I mean, we spent the whole night trying to be mature, and it was kind of boring. I'm sure they're having more fun than we are.",7,Big Bang Theory,153,31
34602,Howard,14," Oh, God, I could really use exactly two tablespoons of Pepto right now.",7,Big Bang Theory,72,13
34604,Sheldon,14," Hey, Los Angeles. I'm on a Ferris Wheel with Darth Vader. And he's nicer than you think.",7,Big Bang Theory,89,17
34607,Sheldon,14," In the jungle, the mighty jungle, the lion sleeps tonight",7,Big Bang Theory,58,10
34609,Sheldon,14," Bring it home, Mufasa. Eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, um, um-a-weh.",7,Big Bang Theory,62,11
34612,Sheldon,14, I don't understand what we're doing.,7,Big Bang Theory,37,6
34614,Sheldon,14, Whose house is this?,7,Big Bang Theory,21,4
34620,Sheldon,14, Okay. But I think it could have ended with the karaoke.,7,Big Bang Theory,56,11
34622,Sheldon,14, Oh. How much does it cost to get them off my lap?,7,Big Bang Theory,50,12
34624,Sheldon,14," Oh, right. Well, my friends and I couldn't get into Comic-Con this year, and I was trying to start my own convention, and I was going to ask if you would be a panelist.",7,Big Bang Theory,169,34
34626,Sheldon,14, Really?,7,Big Bang Theory,8,1
34628,Sheldon,14, Ay-yi-yi. ,7,Big Bang Theory,11,1
34632,Sheldon,14," I'm sorry, who's Angie Dickinson?",7,Big Bang Theory,34,5
34634,Amy,15," Item 28, your pet name for me. Time's running out on this. You need to make a decision.",7,Big Bang Theory,88,18
34635,Sheldon,15, I submitted you a notarised list. ,7,Big Bang Theory,35,6
34636,Amy,15," I'm sorry, but Gollum and Flakey are not acceptable.",7,Big Bang Theory,53,9
34637,Sheldon,15," Well, you don't like Princess Corncob, you don't like Fester, you're just impossible to please.",7,Big Bang Theory,96,15
34638,Amy,15," We'll come back to that one. This brings us to the final item in our annual State of the Relationship Summit. Item 29, Valentine's Day.",7,Big Bang Theory,136,25
34639,Sheldon,15," Ah, the worst for last. Hmm. Classic Flakey.",7,Big Bang Theory,45,8
34640,Amy,15," Before you get upset, I believe I've come up with a way for us to celebrate the occasion that we both can enjoy.",7,Big Bang Theory,113,23
34641,Sheldon,15," People usually start a meeting with a joke, but you go ahead, end with one.",7,Big Bang Theory,76,15
34642,Amy,15, I propose we spend a weekend at a bed-and-breakfast in Napa Valley.,7,Big Bang Theory,68,12
34643,Sheldon,15," I hate every word in that sentence. Including in, at, we and a.",7,Big Bang Theory,64,13
34644,Amy,15," Come on, Sheldon. Why not?",7,Big Bang Theory,27,5
34645,Sheldon,15," For starters, a bed-and-breakfast forces you to eat with strangers at your table.",7,Big Bang Theory,82,13
34646,Amy,15," One step ahead of you, Bernadette and Wolowitz are going with us.",7,Big Bang Theory,66,12
34647,Sheldon,15," Oh, very well. What are the sleeping arrangements? We've only been dating for three years. If we were to share a room, people might talk.",7,Big Bang Theory,138,25
34648,Amy,15, I got you your own room. ,7,Big Bang Theory,26,6
34649,Sheldon,15, What if my room has a claw-foot bathtub?,7,Big Bang Theory,41,8
34650,Amy,15, It doesn't. I know it makes you feel like you're bathing inside a monster.,7,Big Bang Theory,75,14
34651,Sheldon,15," Look, I appreciate the effort, but I'm still unclear how this trip is supposed to be enjoyable for me.",7,Big Bang Theory,103,19
34652,Amy,15, We're going to have Valentine's Day dinner on a fully functioning vintage train.,7,Big Bang Theory,81,13
34653,Sheldon,15, Vintage? Be specific.,7,Big Bang Theory,22,3
34654,Amy,15, An Alcoa FA-4 diesel locomotive leading a train of meticulously restored 1915 Pullman first-class coaches.,7,Big Bang Theory,107,15
34655,Sheldon,15," Wow. I'm feeling the urge to hug you. And one, and two, all right, Gollum, we're good.",7,Big Bang Theory,87,17
34658,Penny,15," No, I think we're just gonna have a quiet weekend at home.",7,Big Bang Theory,59,12
34659,Leonard,15," Plus, I'm not sure it's a great idea to take Penny to where wine comes from. What? It's a joke. Oh, come on. We bust on each other. I wear dorky glasses, you might have a problem, it's all for laughs.",7,Big Bang Theory,201,41
34660,Penny,15, That would really piss me off if I didn't have a buzz going on.,7,Big Bang Theory,64,14
34661,Sheldon,15," Howard, which pocket watch will you be wearing for dinner on the train?",7,Big Bang Theory,72,13
34662,Howard,15," I'm sorry, what?",7,Big Bang Theory,17,3
34663,Sheldon,15," Oh, I'm afraid if we wear the same pocket watch, it will be embarrassing.",7,Big Bang Theory,74,14
34664,Howard,15, I don't own a pocket watch.,7,Big Bang Theory,28,6
34665,Sheldon,15," Oh, my. Well, then my apologies for bringing up this sore spot.",7,Big Bang Theory,64,12
34666,Raj,15," Since you two are gonna be around for Valentine's, would you mind watching Cinnamon?",7,Big Bang Theory,85,14
34667,Penny,15," You have Valentine's plans? Which came out sounding way more surprised than I meant. Here, let me try that again. You have Valent See? I can't do it.",7,Big Bang Theory,150,28
34668,Raj,15, I don't have plans which is why I booked time on the big telescope that night.,7,Big Bang Theory,79,16
34669,Amy,15," Well, an evening looking at the stars, that's still kind of romantic.",7,Big Bang Theory,70,12
34670,Raj,15, Except I'll be alone.,7,Big Bang Theory,22,4
34671,Amy,15, I'm trying to put lipstick on a pig here. Work with me.,7,Big Bang Theory,56,12
34672,Leonard,15, We'd be happy to watch Cinnamon.,7,Big Bang Theory,33,6
34673,Penny,15, Yeah.,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
34674,Raj,15," Thank you. Oh, and I'd like for at least one of us to see some action, so if you guys happen to have sex, it's cool if she stays in the room.",7,Big Bang Theory,142,32
34675,Penny,15," Hey, same goes for the two of you with Amy.",7,Big Bang Theory,44,10
34677,Amy,15," What do you think, Sheldon?",7,Big Bang Theory,28,5
34678,Sheldon,15, It's magnificent. This is going to be the best Valentine's Day ever.,7,Big Bang Theory,69,12
34679,Amy,15, I'm so glad you like it.,7,Big Bang Theory,25,6
34680,Sheldon,15," I'm prepared to say I love it, as soon as I confirm there are no hobos aboard.",7,Big Bang Theory,79,17
34682,Leonard,15," Okay. Raj, I got it. Bye.  That was your daddy. He wanted me to say that he misses Why am I doing this?",7,Big Bang Theory,104,23
34683,Penny,15, Happy Valentine's Day.,7,Big Bang Theory,23,3
34684,Leonard,15," Ooh, flowers and chocolates? Somebody's trying to get me out of my panties.",7,Big Bang Theory,76,13
34685,Penny,15, Don't be surprised if you find five chocolates missing and three gross coconut ones with a bite taken out. It came that way when I bought it.,7,Big Bang Theory,142,27
34686,Leonard,15," Got you a little something, too.",7,Big Bang Theory,33,6
34687,Penny,15," Aw, jewellery. Oh, my God, Lakers tickets?",7,Big Bang Theory,43,7
34688,Leonard,15," It gets better. Instead of me, you can take someone who will actually enjoy it.",7,Big Bang Theory,80,15
34689,Penny,15, Aw. You are the best boyfriend ever.,7,Big Bang Theory,37,7
34690,Leonard,15," Thank you. Seriously, please don't make me go.",7,Big Bang Theory,47,8
34691,Penny,15, Should we take this little party to the bedroom?,7,Big Bang Theory,49,9
34692,Leonard,15," Mm, don't have to, we have the whole place to ourselves.",7,Big Bang Theory,57,11
34693,Penny,15," Oh, that's true. ",7,Big Bang Theory,18,3
34694,Leonard,15," In fact, if you want, we can do it right here on Sheldon's spot.",7,Big Bang Theory,65,14
34695,Penny,15, That is the least sexy thing anyone's ever said to me.,7,Big Bang Theory,55,11
34696,Leonard,15, To the bedroom.,7,Big Bang Theory,16,3
34697,Penny,15, Yeah.,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
34700,Sheldon,15," Uh, I do. Uh, does this train car have the original link-and-pin coupler or the Miller Hook and Platform?",7,Big Bang Theory,106,19
34702,Sheldon,15," Oh, of course. Um, is the seafood risotto being served on a train car with the original link-and-pin coupler or the Miller Hook and Platform?",7,Big Bang Theory,142,25
34703,Amy,15," Uh, I think we're gonna need a minute.",7,Big Bang Theory,39,8
34705,Sheldon,15, Get out of town.,7,Big Bang Theory,17,4
34706,Howard,15," Fun fact, I'm gonna jump off this train.",7,Big Bang Theory,41,8
34708,Leonard,15," Hey, Cinnamon, guess who just did it human style.",7,Big Bang Theory,50,9
34709,Penny,15," Oh, my God.",7,Big Bang Theory,12,3
34710,Leonard,15," It's a little late, but I'll take it.",7,Big Bang Theory,38,8
34711,Penny,15," No, Cinnamon ate the chocolates. That's really bad for dogs.",7,Big Bang Theory,61,10
34712,Leonard,15," Oh, crap. What are we gonna do?",7,Big Bang Theory,32,7
34713,Penny,15, We gotta get her to a vet right now.,7,Big Bang Theory,37,9
34714,Leonard,15," I don't have a vet. I have a podiatrist, an optometrist, an allergist, a dermatologist, a urologist. You'd think I'd have a vet.",7,Big Bang Theory,129,23
34715,Penny,15, Okay. There's one not far from here. Come on. Let's go.,7,Big Bang Theory,56,11
34716,Leonard,15, Okay. Koothrappali was right. We should have let her watch.,7,Big Bang Theory,60,10
34718,Sheldon,15," Do another one, do another one.",7,Big Bang Theory,32,6
34721,Amy,15, See if you guys can guess this one. Bang. Splat. Thud.,7,Big Bang Theory,55,11
34722,Sheldon,15, How many trains have you been on?,7,Big Bang Theory,34,7
34724,Sheldon,15, Wow. Your life's amazing.,7,Big Bang Theory,26,4
34726,Amy,15, Why do I even try?,7,Big Bang Theory,19,5
34728,Howard,15, Okay. Just make it look like an accident.,7,Big Bang Theory,42,8
34730,Sheldon,15, You're right. That was insensitive of me. I have to go back to my table now. You should join us.,7,Big Bang Theory,97,20
34735,Penny,15, A whole box.,7,Big Bang Theory,13,3
34736,Leonard,15," Well, to be fair, you ate a lot of it before you gave it to me. ",7,Big Bang Theory,65,16
34737,Penny,15, So the point is I may have saved her life.,7,Big Bang Theory,43,10
34739,Leonard,15, No. Maybe to her.,7,Big Bang Theory,18,4
34741,Penny,15," Uh, something like this. I don't know. It came free with a full tank of gas.",7,Big Bang Theory,77,16
34742,Leonard,15, Really? Do you know how much those Lakers tickets were?,7,Big Bang Theory,56,10
34743,Penny,15, Do you know how much gas is?,7,Big Bang Theory,29,7
34745,Penny,15, Sorry.,7,Big Bang Theory,7,1
34746,Leonard,15, Sorry.,7,Big Bang Theory,7,1
34747,Raj,15," Oh, my God, Cinnamon, are you okay? I can't believe you two. You do whatever it takes to save her life. If she needs new organs, I'll buy any dog necessary and scrap them for parts.",7,Big Bang Theory,182,36
34749,Raj,15," Owner, father, soul mate, and if anything happens to her, your worst nightmare.",7,Big Bang Theory,80,13
34751,Raj,15," Okay. Okay, thank you. Oh, if she's scared, you can sing to her. She likes Katy Perry. Oh, but don't do Firework, that gets her all riled up.",7,Big Bang Theory,142,28
34755,Sheldon,15, Trick question. There never was one.,7,Big Bang Theory,37,6
34757,Sheldon,15, What?,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
34759,Sheldon,15, In what world is a four-four-six-four a four-ten-four? ,7,Big Bang Theory,56,8
34760,Howard,15," A world I don't want to live in. Seriously, I no longer want to live in this world.",7,Big Bang Theory,84,18
34762,Sheldon,15," I may never stop thinking about it. Amy, what are the odds we run into this guy?",7,Big Bang Theory,81,17
34765,Sheldon,15, I never want this day to end.,7,Big Bang Theory,30,7
34766,Amy,15, It's feeling like it never will.,7,Big Bang Theory,33,6
34767,Sheldon,15, Come on.,7,Big Bang Theory,9,2
34770,Raj,15," As if Valentine's Day wasn't bad enough, you try to kill my dog? And with cheap chocolate, no less?",7,Big Bang Theory,100,19
34771,Penny,15, It wasn't cheap. It was free.,7,Big Bang Theory,30,6
34772,Leonard,15, We're really sorry. It was an accident.,7,Big Bang Theory,40,7
34773,Penny,15," Yeah, we weren't even out of the room that long.",7,Big Bang Theory,49,10
34774,Leonard,15," Oh, no, come on. It was a while. It was a while.",7,Big Bang Theory,49,12
34775,Raj,15," Oh, is Cinnamon gonna be okay?",7,Big Bang Theory,31,6
34777,Raj,15," All right. Uh, would, would it be okay for me to see her? We're usually in bed by now, and I want her to know that I'm here. Yes, we sleep together, and sometimes we spoon.",7,Big Bang Theory,173,36
34779,Raj,15, Thank you.,7,Big Bang Theory,11,2
34781,Raj,15," Oh, yeah?",7,Big Bang Theory,10,2
34783,Penny,15, I think there's something going on between the two of them.,7,Big Bang Theory,60,11
34784,Leonard,15," Maybe, but you also think nine minutes isn't a while, so what do you know?",7,Big Bang Theory,75,15
34786,Howard,15, You okay?,7,Big Bang Theory,10,2
34787,Amy,15, Why? Because my boyfriend's off playing choo-choo with some weirdo?,7,Big Bang Theory,68,10
34788,Howard,15," Well, to be fair, they're both weirdos.",7,Big Bang Theory,40,7
34789,Amy,15, I don't know what made me think tonight would be any different.,7,Big Bang Theory,64,12
34791,Howard,15, I'm going to the Lego store to get a big-ass R2-D2.,7,Big Bang Theory,52,11
34793,Howard,15, She's right. ,7,Big Bang Theory,14,2
34795,Howard,15, I had a little to do with it.,7,Big Bang Theory,30,8
34797,Howard,15, I am.,7,Big Bang Theory,6,2
34799,Leonard,15," They've been in there, like, half an hour.",7,Big Bang Theory,43,8
34800,Penny,15," Yeah, for future reference, that's a while.",7,Big Bang Theory,44,7
34801,Leonard,15, How long should we stay?,7,Big Bang Theory,25,5
34802,Penny,15, I don't know. I'm kind of hungry.,7,Big Bang Theory,34,7
34803,Leonard,15, I saw a Thai place next door.,7,Big Bang Theory,30,7
34804,Penny,15, Oh. Okay. Oh. Oh. Hey.,7,Big Bang Theory,23,5
34805,Leonard,15, How's she doing?,7,Big Bang Theory,17,3
34806,Penny,15, How is everything?,7,Big Bang Theory,19,3
34807,Leonard,15, Yeah.,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
34808,Raj,15, She's gonna be okay; they're gonna let me take her home.,7,Big Bang Theory,57,11
34809,Penny,15," Oh, good.",7,Big Bang Theory,10,2
34811,Raj,15, Oh. Thank you for taking such good care of my little girl.,7,Big Bang Theory,59,12
34813,Leonard,15," Yes, thank you for all your help.",7,Big Bang Theory,34,7
34814,Penny,15, Yeah. I'm sorry if you didn't think we were taking it seriously. We love animals.,7,Big Bang Theory,82,15
34816,Penny,15, No.,7,Big Bang Theory,4,1
34819,Howard,15, I love you so much.,7,Big Bang Theory,20,5
34821,Howard,15, Sorry.,7,Big Bang Theory,7,1
34824,Sheldon,15, The conductor and I have the same pocket watch. ,7,Big Bang Theory,49,9
34826,Sheldon,15," Dare I say loco? Oh, and, Amy, guess what? The conductor said as soon as he gets off work, he can come back to the bed and breakfast and play his banjo for us.",7,Big Bang Theory,160,34
34827,Amy,15," Okay. I need to speak to my boyfriend in private, like, right now.",7,Big Bang Theory,67,13
34828,Howard,15, There's a car with a glass roof. Want to go look at the stars?,7,Big Bang Theory,63,14
34830,Amy,15," Oh, give it a rest.",7,Big Bang Theory,20,5
34832,Amy,15, Why are you still here?,7,Big Bang Theory,24,5
34833,Sheldon,15, Excuse me. I think you're being a little rude.,7,Big Bang Theory,47,9
34834,Amy,15, I'm being rude? You've been rude to me this entire evening.,7,Big Bang Theory,60,11
34835,Sheldon,15, How is that possible? I've hardly spoken to you since we got on the train.,7,Big Bang Theory,75,15
34837,Sheldon,15, I get it.,7,Big Bang Theory,10,3
34838,Amy,15, Leave.,7,Big Bang Theory,7,1
34839,Sheldon,15, What is your problem?,7,Big Bang Theory,22,4
34840,Amy,15, It's Valentine's Day. We're supposed to be having a romantic weekend.,7,Big Bang Theory,70,11
34841,Sheldon,15," Oh, really? Because I remember you saying that this trip was going to be something we could both enjoy. Did you mean that, or were you just trying to trick me?",7,Big Bang Theory,160,31
34842,Amy,15," Fine, it's true. I deserve romance, and I didn't know how else to make it happen.",7,Big Bang Theory,82,16
34843,Sheldon,15," Well, if you want romance, then let's have romance. Oh, look, there's wine. Mmm. Grape juice that burns. Uh, now let's gaze into each other's eyes, hmm? You blinked. I win.",7,Big Bang Theory,173,31
34844,Amy,15, Sheldon.,7,Big Bang Theory,9,1
34845,Sheldon,15," Let's see. What's next? Oh, kissing's romantic.",7,Big Bang Theory,48,7
34846,Amy,15, That was nice.,7,Big Bang Theory,15,3
34847,Sheldon,15," Good. Um, the conductor said if I come back to the engine room, he'd show me how to bring the train through a crossing.",7,Big Bang Theory,120,24
34848,Amy,15," Okay, have fun.",7,Big Bang Theory,16,3
34849,Sheldon,15, Do you want to come with me?,7,Big Bang Theory,29,7
34850,Amy,15, Really? I do.,7,Big Bang Theory,14,3
34853,Raj,15," There you go. All cozy wozy. Here, let's see what the doctor says to keep an eye out for. Hmm. Rajesh, I was dreading Valentine's Day. Thank you for spending it with me. Yvette. Cinnamon, she-she gave me her phone number. If I'd known it was that easy, I would have considered poisoning you months ago. Oh, what should I say? Oh, I know. I'll point out her name's Yvette, and that she's a vet. That's hysterical. She'll love it.",7,Big Bang Theory,429,80
34855,Sheldon,15, Hello.,7,Big Bang Theory,7,1
34856,Leonard,15," Oh, hey. You're back. How was your trip?",7,Big Bang Theory,41,8
34857,Sheldon,15, It was wonderful. ,7,Big Bang Theory,19,3
34858,Leonard,15, Great. What did you do?,7,Big Bang Theory,24,5
34859,Sheldon,15," I made a new friend who likes trains as much as I do, uh, I kissed Amy on the lips, and, uh, the conductor played his banjo for me. Good night.",7,Big Bang Theory,144,31
34860,Leonard,15," Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm gonna need more details.",7,Big Bang Theory,65,11
34861,Sheldon,15," Oh, well, my new friend's name was Eric. Um, Amy lips tasted like the brownie we had for dessert. Oh, and the banjo-playing conductor was missing a finger, but he made up for it with his can-do attitude.",7,Big Bang Theory,204,38
34862,Leonard,15," No, hang on. Hang on. Are all those things equal to you?",7,Big Bang Theory,57,12
34863,Sheldon,15, Hmm. It never occurred to me to pick a favourite.,7,Big Bang Theory,50,10
34864,Leonard,15," Well, give it a go.",7,Big Bang Theory,20,5
34865,Sheldon,15, I can't answer that without collecting additional data.,7,Big Bang Theory,56,8
34866,Leonard,15, Additional data. You dog.,7,Big Bang Theory,26,4
34867,Sheldon,15," I'm not sure how listening to other nine-fingered banjo players makes me dog, but all right.",7,Big Bang Theory,93,16
34869,Howard,16, I'm thinking about growing a goatee.,7,Big Bang Theory,37,6
34870,Raj,16," Oh, actually that's a Van Dyke. A goatee is just hair on the chin.",7,Big Bang Theory,67,14
34871,Leonard,16," Oh. Wait, then what is it if you just have hair up here?",7,Big Bang Theory,57,13
34872,Raj,16, You mean a moo-stache?,7,Big Bang Theory,23,4
34873,Leonard,16, Moo-stache.,7,Big Bang Theory,12,1
34874,Howard,16, He said it.,7,Big Bang Theory,12,3
34875,Raj,16," Ha-ha, very funny. Make fun of the foreign guy. For your information, there are four times as many Indians as there are Americans, so the way we say it is right.",7,Big Bang Theory,162,31
34876,Howard,16, Say what?,7,Big Bang Theory,10,2
34877,Raj,16, Moo-stache.,7,Big Bang Theory,12,1
34878,Leonard,16, Moo-stache.,7,Big Bang Theory,12,1
34879,Howard,16, He said it.,7,Big Bang Theory,12,3
34881,Sheldon,16," Yeah, she's right. You're grown men, the kind who are perfectly capable of growing your own moo-staches.",7,Big Bang Theory,105,17
34882,Amy,16," Hey, you were funny on purpose, good job.",7,Big Bang Theory,42,8
34883,Penny,16," Hi. Sorry I'm late, I was at an audition.",7,Big Bang Theory,42,9
34884,Leonard,16," Oh, I'm sorry.",7,Big Bang Theory,15,3
34885,Sheldon,16, You'll get 'em next time.,7,Big Bang Theory,26,5
34886,Penny,16," How about instead of assuming I failed, you ask me how it went?",7,Big Bang Theory,64,13
34887,Leonard,16, Sorry. How did it go?,7,Big Bang Theory,22,5
34888,Penny,16, Just shut up.,7,Big Bang Theory,14,3
34889,Raj,16," Here, you can have your seat.",7,Big Bang Theory,30,6
34890,Penny,16," No, no, no, stay there. I'm fine on the floor.",7,Big Bang Theory,47,10
34892,Amy,16, Yeah. You actually do have room for one up there.,7,Big Bang Theory,50,10
34893,Raj,16," Oh, sure, I sit on the floor for years, no one cares. The pretty white girl's there ten seconds, and suddenly we're all running to IKEA.",7,Big Bang Theory,137,26
34894,Sheldon,16, No one is running anywhere. We're not getting a dining room table.,7,Big Bang Theory,67,12
34895,Leonard,16," I know you don't like change, but it's not a terrible idea.",7,Big Bang Theory,60,12
34896,Penny,16," Yeah, you guys never use that space up there. Why not get a table?",7,Big Bang Theory,67,14
34897,Sheldon,16, Do you want the long answer or the short answer?,7,Big Bang Theory,49,10
34898,Howard,16," Hey, how come we never get that option?",7,Big Bang Theory,40,8
34899,Sheldon,16," Chaos theory suggests that even in a deterministic system, if the equations describing its behaviour are non-linear, a tiny change in the initial conditions can lead to a cataclysmic and unpredictable result.",7,Big Bang Theory,209,32
34900,Penny,16, Translation?,7,Big Bang Theory,13,1
34901,Leonard,16, Waah. I don't want a table.,7,Big Bang Theory,28,6
34903,Leonard,16," Hey, Penny and I are gonna go shop for a dining room table. You want to come with us?",7,Big Bang Theory,86,19
34904,Sheldon,16," You know, I'd love to, but, um, I'm too busy falling back in love with Windows 98.",7,Big Bang Theory,83,17
34905,Leonard,16," Seriously? You haven't used this desk in years. The second I want to get rid of it, you're up here working?",7,Big Bang Theory,108,21
34906,Sheldon,16," I can't talk right now, I have several thousand updates to install.",7,Big Bang Theory,68,12
34907,Leonard,16, Are you really gonna sit here all day?,7,Big Bang Theory,39,8
34908,Sheldon,16," Think of me as Arthur Dent in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, lying in front of the bulldozers to protect his home.",7,Big Bang Theory,118,22
34909,Leonard,16," If you'll recall, the Vogon fleet blew up the Earth anyway.",7,Big Bang Theory,60,11
34910,Sheldon,16," It's a made-up story, Leonard, I don't even know why you're talking about it.",7,Big Bang Theory,78,14
34911,Leonard,16, I'm putting all this stuff in storage. We don't need any of it.,7,Big Bang Theory,64,13
34912,Sheldon,16," You, how can you say that? You show me one thing in here we can live without.",7,Big Bang Theory,78,17
34913,Leonard,16," Oh, hang on. Check your in-box.",7,Big Bang Theory,32,6
34914,Sheldon,16, Wait. Is this really worth it? We've lived together for years with nary an argument.,7,Big Bang Theory,85,15
34915,Leonard,16, Huh?,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
34916,Sheldon,16," But we start talking about a table, and suddenly we're at each other's throats.",7,Big Bang Theory,80,14
34917,Leonard,16, Nary an argument? Nary?,7,Big Bang Theory,24,4
34918,Sheldon,16," Well, that means not one, or not any. Maybe instead of a table, you should buy a dictionary. Well, I don't know if I won that, but at least he's upset.",7,Big Bang Theory,152,31
34920,Howard,16, Check it out.,7,Big Bang Theory,14,3
34921,Raj,16, Magic wand TV remote?,7,Big Bang Theory,22,4
34922,Howard,16," Yeah, I can control all sorts of stuff.",7,Big Bang Theory,40,8
34923,Raj,16, Did Bernadette think it was cool?,7,Big Bang Theory,34,6
34924,Howard,16, Not when I said mute and pointed it at her face.,7,Big Bang Theory,49,11
34925,Raj,16," Oh, uh, let me try. Uh, channelis changeroni. This might be my second favorite brown magic wand.",7,Big Bang Theory,97,17
34926,Raj,16," Uh, off. And on. And the Oprah Network. This is so much better than watching TV like a muggle.",7,Big Bang Theory,95,19
34927,Howard,16, Okay. Thank you. We'll be in touch. You're not gonna believe this.,7,Big Bang Theory,67,12
34928,Raj,16, What's going on? Oh. Wait. On. And off. What's going on?,7,Big Bang Theory,57,11
34929,Howard,16, That was NASA. They want me to go back up to the space station.,7,Big Bang Theory,64,14
34930,Raj,16, Wow. What did you tell them?,7,Big Bang Theory,29,6
34931,Howard,16, I told them I'd be honoured.,7,Big Bang Theory,29,6
34932,Raj,16," A second trip to space, I'll miss you.",7,Big Bang Theory,39,8
34933,Howard,16," And I'm gonna miss you, too.",7,Big Bang Theory,29,6
34934,Raj,16," And I just want you to know, I'm happy to look in on Bernadette while you're gone.",7,Big Bang Theory,83,17
34935,Howard,16, Thank you.,7,Big Bang Theory,11,2
34936,Raj,16," And if anything were to happen to you, we will name our first born son Howard. I'm just kidding. We'll name him Dalib, after my grandfather.",7,Big Bang Theory,141,26
34938,Penny,16," Ooh, this one looks nice.",7,Big Bang Theory,26,5
34939,Leonard,16, No. Sheldon doesn't like reclaimed wood.,7,Big Bang Theory,41,6
34940,Penny,16, Why not?,7,Big Bang Theory,9,2
34941,Leonard,16, He's afraid the original owners will come back.,7,Big Bang Theory,48,8
34942,Penny,16," Yeah. Well, Sheldon's not here.",7,Big Bang Theory,32,5
34943,Leonard,16," Well, he is here. So unless you want to dig him out with a bone saw and a melon baller, there's nothing I can do about it.",7,Big Bang Theory,123,27
34944,Penny,16," All right, sweetie, you're paying for this table, and it's your apartment, too.",7,Big Bang Theory,80,13
34945,Leonard,16," I know, but",7,Big Bang Theory,12,3
34946,Penny,16, No buts. You got to stop letting him boss you around.,7,Big Bang Theory,54,11
34947,Leonard,16," You're right. I mean, he decides what TV shows we watch, what food we eat, who my favourite hobbit is. I wanted Frodo, but we can't both have Frodo, so guess who's stuck with Samwise Gamgee.",7,Big Bang Theory,191,36
34948,Penny,16," See? Right there. You're a grown man, you should be able to pick whichever hobbit you want. Wish you wouldn't, but one problem at a time.",7,Big Bang Theory,138,26
34949,Leonard,16," You make a lot of sense. I like this table, and I'm getting it.",7,Big Bang Theory,64,14
34950,Penny,16, Really? This one?,7,Big Bang Theory,18,3
34951,Leonard,16, That one? Damn right I like that one.,7,Big Bang Theory,38,8
34954,Howard,16, Good news. Someone in this room gets to take a ride on a rocket.,7,Big Bang Theory,65,14
34956,Howard,16," No, not that. Although you already agreed to it, so no take-backs.",7,Big Bang Theory,67,12
34958,Howard,16," Sit down. NASA called. The telescope mount I installed on the space station got damaged, and they want me to go back up and fix it.",7,Big Bang Theory,132,26
34960,Howard,16, What do you think I said? I said yes. Why do you look surprised?,7,Big Bang Theory,65,14
34962,Howard,16, Are you kidding? It was the greatest experience of my life.,7,Big Bang Theory,60,11
34964,Howard,16, I think you have me confused with what's gonna happen when you get out of that shower.,7,Big Bang Theory,87,17
34966,Leonard,16," Hey, all set. What do you think? There's plenty of room for everybody, a view out the window.",7,Big Bang Theory,94,18
34967,Sheldon,16, My spot on the couch has a great view of a window. Sometimes I can see space battles through it. It's called a TV.,7,Big Bang Theory,115,24
34968,Penny,16," Give it a chance, Sheldon, you might actually like it.",7,Big Bang Theory,55,10
34969,Sheldon,16, You're absolutely right. Nope.,7,Big Bang Theory,31,4
34970,Penny,16," Well, you can't say he didn't give it a fair shot.",7,Big Bang Theory,51,11
34971,Sheldon,16," So, when can we get rid of it?",7,Big Bang Theory,31,8
34972,Leonard,16, We're not.,7,Big Bang Theory,11,2
34973,Sheldon,16," What about the roommate agreement? It specifically states that any changes in furnishing have to be approved by the Furnishing Committee. Which only sits on alternate years. Yeah, and by the way, it sits over there.",7,Big Bang Theory,216,36
34974,Penny,16," Come on, that is ridiculous.",7,Big Bang Theory,29,5
34975,Leonard,16," She's right, a committee that important should meet more often.",7,Big Bang Theory,64,10
34976,Penny,16, That's not what I'm saying.,7,Big Bang Theory,28,5
34977,Leonard,16, Oh. This is the thing about me standing up to him and not letting him run my life?,7,Big Bang Theory,83,18
34978,Penny,16, Yes.,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
34979,Leonard,16, That.,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
34980,Sheldon,16, Okay. I think we've found the problem here. It's not the table at all. It's you.,7,Big Bang Theory,81,16
34981,Penny,16, Me?,7,Big Bang Theory,4,1
34982,Leonard,16," Well, it's always me, take one for the team.",7,Big Bang Theory,45,9
34983,Sheldon,16," I have spent years turning this lump of clay into an acceptable conduit for my will, and then you came along and reshaped him, with your newfangled ideas and your fancy genitals.",7,Big Bang Theory,179,32
34984,Penny,16, Are you gonna let him talk to me like this?,7,Big Bang Theory,44,10
34985,Leonard,16, Fancy sounds like a compliment.,7,Big Bang Theory,32,5
34986,Penny,16," Okay, I have not tried to change Leonard. That's just what happens in relationships. Look how much Amy's changed you.",7,Big Bang Theory,118,20
34987,Sheldon,16, That's not true.,7,Big Bang Theory,17,3
34988,Penny,16," Oh, please. When I first met you, you were incapable of touching another human being. Now you're holding hands, you're going on dates, you even made out with her on a train.",7,Big Bang Theory,174,32
34989,Sheldon,16, She told you?,7,Big Bang Theory,14,3
34990,Penny,16," Of course she told me, it's the most interesting thing that's ever happened to her in her entire life.",7,Big Bang Theory,103,19
34991,Leonard,16," You're too close to it, but Amy has had a huge impact on you.",7,Big Bang Theory,62,14
34992,Sheldon,16," You're right. Without realizing it, I've allowed that woman to alter my personality.",7,Big Bang Theory,85,13
34993,Leonard,16," Mm, Sheldon, you didn't have a personality, you just had some shows you liked.",7,Big Bang Theory,79,14
34994,Sheldon,16," No. No, I've changed. Like the frog who's put in a pot of water that's heated so gradually he doesn't realize he's boiling to death.",7,Big Bang Theory,133,25
34995,Penny,16, Or you're the frog who's been kissed by a princess and turned into a prince.,7,Big Bang Theory,77,15
34996,Leonard,16," Or you're just a tall, annoying frog.",7,Big Bang Theory,38,7
34997,Sheldon,16, Excuse me. I have to break up with my girlfriend.,7,Big Bang Theory,50,10
34998,Penny,16," Oh, Sheldon, wait.",7,Big Bang Theory,19,3
34999,Sheldon,16," No. You've opened my eyes to the truth. Amy has made me a more affectionate, open-minded person. And that stops now.",7,Big Bang Theory,117,21
35000,Leonard,16," Well, we should call her.",7,Big Bang Theory,26,5
35001,Penny,16," Yeah, mm-hmm. Amy, it's Penny. Hey. Just a little heads-up. Leonard bought a dining room table. Yeah. Sheldon's breaking up with you.",7,Big Bang Theory,134,22
35003,Sheldon,16,"  Amy?  Amy?  Amy? I'll get right to the point. I think we need to end this relationship, so just sign this with your finger, and, uh, please don't cry on my iPad, I didn't get AppleCare.",7,Big Bang Theory,187,36
35004,Amy,16," I'm not surprised you want to end the relationship. I'm a little surprised you didn't get AppleCare. Anyway, enjoy your life. Where do I sign?",7,Big Bang Theory,143,25
35005,Sheldon,16," At the bottom. I must say, I'm relieved you're not making more of a scene out of this.",7,Big Bang Theory,87,18
35006,Amy,16," Oh, I've already moved on. Besides, this breakup has nothing to do with me.",7,Big Bang Theory,76,14
35007,Sheldon,16, It doesn't?,7,Big Bang Theory,12,2
35008,Amy,16, Of course not. This is just Leonard trying to take the focus off that dreadful table by sowing discord in our relationship. He's manipulating you like he always does.,7,Big Bang Theory,167,29
35009,Sheldon,16," Wait, wait, now, hang on. You think he manipulates me?",7,Big Bang Theory,55,10
35010,Amy,16," All the time. And he knew that, as your girlfriend, I wasn't gonna stand by and let him bring a table into your apartment. I mean, a table? Come on?",7,Big Bang Theory,149,30
35011,Sheldon,16, It is hideous.,7,Big Bang Theory,15,3
35012,Amy,16," Well, thankfully, I won't have to see it, 'cause I won't be your girlfriend anymore. Amy Farrah Fowler. Why, yes, I would like to take a survey.",7,Big Bang Theory,145,27
35013,Sheldon,16, Wait. You were really gonna stand by me against the dining room table?,7,Big Bang Theory,71,13
35014,Amy,16, Of course I was.,7,Big Bang Theory,17,4
35015,Sheldon,16, Wait. How do I know that you're not manipulating me right now?,7,Big Bang Theory,63,12
35016,Amy,16," I think if I were manipulating you, you'd be smart enough to see it.",7,Big Bang Theory,69,14
35017,Sheldon,16, How do I know you're not saying that as part of the manipulation?,7,Big Bang Theory,66,13
35018,Amy,16," I think you'd be smart enough to see that, too.",7,Big Bang Theory,48,10
35019,Sheldon,16," Okay. I'm sorry I gave you such a hard time, I just had to be sure.",7,Big Bang Theory,68,16
35021,Raj,16, It's pretty exciting that NASA wants to send Howard back up.,7,Big Bang Theory,61,11
35023,Raj,16, Course.,7,Big Bang Theory,8,1
35025,Raj,16, Not at all. He's forgotten how miserable he was the entire time he was up there. It's like me in those moments when I miss India.,7,Big Bang Theory,130,26
35027,Raj,16, Why me?,7,Big Bang Theory,8,2
35029,Raj,16," That's the dynamic, I'm the fun one, you're the buzzkill.",7,Big Bang Theory,58,10
35031,Raj,16, Do you think this is cool?,7,Big Bang Theory,27,6
35033,Raj,16, Aha.,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
35036,Sheldon,16, Hello.,7,Big Bang Theory,7,1
35037,Leonard,16," Oh, hey. You guys didn't break up.",7,Big Bang Theory,35,7
35038,Sheldon,16," No. Sorry to disappoint you, but Amy pointed out that you were only trying to manipulate me.",7,Big Bang Theory,93,17
35039,Amy,16, Which you also figured out by yourself.,7,Big Bang Theory,40,7
35040,Sheldon,16, Which I also figured out by myself.,7,Big Bang Theory,36,7
35041,Penny,16," Well, I'm glad you're still together.",7,Big Bang Theory,38,6
35042,Sheldon,16," Yeah, okay, you can stop trying to make this about our relationship.",7,Big Bang Theory,69,12
35043,Amy,16, Which is stronger than ever.,7,Big Bang Theory,29,5
35044,Sheldon,16," Which is stronger than ever. This is about you trying to change my environment, which was perfect the way it was.",7,Big Bang Theory,114,21
35045,Howard,16," But it got the way it was through change. The-the-the spot that you love to sit in, that no one else can sit in, only exists because, despite your objections. I bought this couch. Me. So explain why that change was bad and this change was good.",7,Big Bang Theory,245,47
35046,Sheldon,16, Um.,7,Big Bang Theory,4,1
35047,Amy,16, You don't need to explain yourself to him.,7,Big Bang Theory,43,8
35048,Sheldon,16, I don't need to explain myself to you!,7,Big Bang Theory,39,8
35049,Amy,16, You're sick of his nonsense and ready to move in with me.,7,Big Bang Theory,58,12
35050,Sheldon,16, Keep the table. We don't use that space.,7,Big Bang Theory,41,8
35051,Amy,16," Damn it, I got cocky.",7,Big Bang Theory,22,5
35053,Howard,16," Hey, Bernie. I'm home. Hello.",7,Big Bang Theory,30,5
35055,Howard,16, What's going on?,7,Big Bang Theory,17,3
35057,Howard,16," Um, okay. I know my mom's not dead, there'd be balloons.",7,Big Bang Theory,57,11
35058,Raj,16," Um, okay. First off, know that we all love you and cherish you.",7,Big Bang Theory,64,13
35063,Raj,16," Oh, of course.",7,Big Bang Theory,15,3
35065,Howard,16, Massimino? Why are you here?,7,Big Bang Theory,29,5
35067,Howard,16, Sure.,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
35069,Howard,16, You don't think I did a good job up there?,7,Big Bang Theory,43,10
35072,Raj,16, Like how women often forget the pain of childbirth.,7,Big Bang Theory,52,9
35074,Howard,16," Fine, maybe I was a little scared.",7,Big Bang Theory,35,7
35076,Howard,16, You're supposed to do that.,7,Big Bang Theory,28,5
35079,Howard,16, Hang on. That was just me joking around.,7,Big Bang Theory,41,8
35081,Howard,16," Come on, how is that not a joke? You got to get me out of this. Shoot me in the foot.",7,Big Bang Theory,86,21
35083,Raj,16," And how you threw up in zero gravity, and it floated back in your mouth. And you threw up again. And so on and so on.",7,Big Bang Theory,118,26
35085,Howard,16," Okay, so I wasn't exactly John Glenn up there, but I've changed. I'm a different man now. Yeah, and I'm a little insulted that you guys don't think I can handle it.",7,Big Bang Theory,165,32
35087,Howard,16, Really?,7,Big Bang Theory,8,1
35089,Howard,16, You've got to get me out of this.,7,Big Bang Theory,34,8
35091,Howard,16, Check my blood pressure again. I can get it higher. just give me a second.  ,7,Big Bang Theory,77,15
35093,Howard,16," Hi, Ma. How are you?",7,Big Bang Theory,21,5
35095,Howard,16," Go, go, go.",7,Big Bang Theory,12,3
35099,Raj,16," Howard, I'm so sorry your blood pressure was off the charts.",7,Big Bang Theory,61,11
35100,Howard,16," Oh, me, too. I mean, the doctor was willing to fudge the results, but it just seemed so darned dishonest.",7,Big Bang Theory,106,20
35101,Leonard,16, But the mission wouldn't be for at least a year. Isn't that enough time to get your blood pressure under,7,Big Bang Theory,105,20
35102,Howard,16," Look, my blood pressure's too high, okay? Drop it.",7,Big Bang Theory,51,9
35103,Penny,16," You know, my aunt changed her diet, and in a few months, she",7,Big Bang Theory,61,13
35104,Howard,16," Went to space? I don't think so. Now, pass the soy sauce. Hey, not the green one, the red one.",7,Big Bang Theory,95,20
35105,Penny,16," Sheldon, Amy, will you please come join us?",7,Big Bang Theory,44,8
35107,Leonard,16, So why are you trying to ruin it?,7,Big Bang Theory,34,8
35108,Sheldon,16," No, thanks. We're fine. I mean, if you people want to eat at the table, then that's what you should do. I like eating down here because this is how we've always done things. But if those days are gone, they're gone. It just makes me sad.",7,Big Bang Theory,238,47
35110,Leonard,16," Oh, don't anthropomorphize him, he's got big eyes, but his feelings are not like ours.",7,Big Bang Theory,87,15
35112,Leonard,16," Well, it's not silly if you think of that group as being led by a big, evil baby.",7,Big Bang Theory,82,18
35114,Penny,16," Yeah, let's go.",7,Big Bang Theory,16,3
35115,Leonard,16," But Penny, this was your idea. You said that I should stand up to him.",7,Big Bang Theory,71,15
35116,Penny,16," Forget it, Leonard. It's over.",7,Big Bang Theory,31,5
35117,Leonard,16, Fine.,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
35118,Amy,16, Rajesh?,7,Big Bang Theory,8,1
35119,Raj,16, Screw that! I sat on the floor for seven years. I'm staying right here.,7,Big Bang Theory,72,14
35121,Raj,16, Fine. But no more making fun of how I say tings.,7,Big Bang Theory,49,11
35122,Howard,16, You mean tings like moo-stache?,7,Big Bang Theory,32,5
35123,Sheldon,16," Well, isn't this nice. Sometimes the baby wins.",7,Big Bang Theory,48,8
35126,Raj,17," Thank you. That was the closest I've come to sex in, like, two years.",7,Big Bang Theory,70,14
35128,Raj,17, You're only making it seem more real for me.,7,Big Bang Theory,45,9
35129,Howard,17," Hey, that's my wife. If anyone's gonna make her feel gross about sex, it's me.",7,Big Bang Theory,79,15
35130,Raj,17, Can we please talk about something other than my depressing love life?,7,Big Bang Theory,71,12
35131,Sheldon,17, How about Penny's depressing acting career?,7,Big Bang Theory,44,6
35132,Leonard,17," Hey. I mean, it's been a little tough, but Penny's following her dreams, and in my book, that is not depressing.",7,Big Bang Theory,113,21
35133,Penny,17," Aw, thank you.",7,Big Bang Theory,15,3
35134,Howard,17, Is that book called Lies I Tell to Get Sex?,7,Big Bang Theory,44,10
35135,Raj,17, Is that a real book? I would totally read that book.,7,Big Bang Theory,53,11
35136,Amy,17, Can I borrow it when you're done?,7,Big Bang Theory,34,7
35137,Penny,17," Well, I'll have you guys know I turned down a part in a movie last week.",7,Big Bang Theory,73,16
35138,Leonard,17, Why would you do that?,7,Big Bang Theory,23,5
35139,Penny,17, Because it was crap. It's a sequel to that awful killer gorilla movie I was in.,7,Big Bang Theory,80,16
35141,Sheldon,17, She does. 42 minutes in.,7,Big Bang Theory,25,5
35142,Raj,17," While showering topless, 16 minutes after brief side butt during a pillow fight with her sorority sisters.",7,Big Bang Theory,107,17
35143,Sheldon,17, I have an eidetic memory. I don't know what his problem is.,7,Big Bang Theory,60,12
35144,Penny,17," Okay, well, there are no shower scenes in this one. They just try to clone me from my corpse, but my DNA gets mixed with the ape's DNA and I end up running around with giant gorilla hands and feet.",7,Big Bang Theory,198,40
35145,Sheldon,17," Am I missing something, or isn't that the part she was born to play?",7,Big Bang Theory,69,14
35147,Leonard,17, So are you really not gonna do this movie?,7,Big Bang Theory,43,9
35148,Penny,17," Well, I don't think it's the kind of part that's good for my career.",7,Big Bang Theory,69,14
35149,Leonard,17," Well, but don't a lot of famous actors get their start doing bad movies?",7,Big Bang Theory,73,14
35150,Penny,17," Okay, I don't think Meryl Streep ever had to say â€œMust keep gorilla hands from killing again!â€ù",7,Big Bang Theory,99,17
35151,Raj,17," If she did, it would be amazing. That woman can do no wrong.",7,Big Bang Theory,61,13
35152,Leonard,17," I don't know anything about show business, so if you think it's reasonable to turn down paid work and just burn through your savings, I'm sure you know what you're doing.",7,Big Bang Theory,171,31
35153,Amy,17, I think we're gonna go.,7,Big Bang Theory,24,5
35154,Sheldon,17, Are you sure? We were making fun of failed careers. We didn't get to tap the juicy vein that is Howard's.,7,Big Bang Theory,106,21
35155,Howard,17," Hey, I work at the same university you do.",7,Big Bang Theory,43,9
35156,Sheldon,17," Yes, and Hawkeye's in the Avengers, but no one ever says help, Hawkeye.",7,Big Bang Theory,72,13
35158,Penny,17," Oh, I'm sure he does it out of love. The same way my boyfriend makes me feel terrible about my life choices.",7,Big Bang Theory,109,22
35159,Amy,17, I think we're gonna go.,7,Big Bang Theory,24,5
35160,Leonard,17," No, no, no. This is not a fight. I was just excited that someone offered you a part and a little surprised that you'd rather sit at home and do nothing than take it. Now it's a fight.",7,Big Bang Theory,184,38
35161,Sheldon,17," Well, with that sorted out, I'm happy to answer your question, Bernadette. Howard started it.",7,Big Bang Theory,94,15
35162,Howard,17, I didn't do anything. I was just sitting here.,7,Big Bang Theory,47,9
35163,Sheldon,17," I wasn't referring to this evening. Ten years ago, upon first seeing me, your husband claimed that I looked like C-3PO and Pee-wee Herman. And he called me C-3P-wee Herman.",7,Big Bang Theory,173,30
35164,Raj,17, Ha-a-a. Still funny.,7,Big Bang Theory,21,3
35166,Sheldon,17," Nine years, 11 months and three weeks ago, he followed that up by replacing the slides for my lecture with photographs of nude fat women bending over.",7,Big Bang Theory,151,27
35167,Amy,17, Really?,7,Big Bang Theory,8,1
35168,Howard,17, The lecture was on cosmic gas clouds. That's funny.,7,Big Bang Theory,52,9
35169,Raj,17, I was there. It was funny.,7,Big Bang Theory,27,6
35170,Sheldon,17," In any event, that began a decade-long progression of insults, pranks and unwanted magazine subscriptions. To this day, I still get a monthly copy of Granny on Granny. Which, other than its surprisingly fun puzzle page, is complete filth.",7,Big Bang Theory,239,39
35172,Amy,17, Thanks for walking me to my car.,7,Big Bang Theory,33,7
35173,Raj,17," Actually, it's for both of us. Last night, I watched West Side Story, and I'm a little freaked out by street gangs.",7,Big Bang Theory,116,22
35174,Amy,17, Why can't Raj find a girl? The mystery continues.,7,Big Bang Theory,50,9
35175,Raj,17," I don't appreciate your sarcasm, but we've still got two blocks to go, so I'll put up with it.",7,Big Bang Theory,95,19
35176,Amy,17, Whatever happened with your online dating?,7,Big Bang Theory,43,6
35177,Raj,17," No one was writing me back, so I stopped checking my profile.",7,Big Bang Theory,62,12
35178,Amy,17," Before I met Sheldon, I was ready to give up, too. Once, I even dropped in on my OBGYN just to get some human contact.",7,Big Bang Theory,119,25
35179,Raj,17, It has been a while since I got my prostate checked.,7,Big Bang Theory,53,11
35180,Amy,17, Then I met Sheldon and look at where we are now.,7,Big Bang Theory,49,11
35181,Raj,17," What? You've kissed, like, once in three years.",7,Big Bang Theory,48,8
35182,Amy,17, That's true. Do whatever you want.,7,Big Bang Theory,35,6
35184,Howard,17, Hey.,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
35185,Sheldon,17, Hello.,7,Big Bang Theory,7,1
35186,Howard,17," Listen, I was thinking you and I could probably try to be better friends.",7,Big Bang Theory,74,14
35187,Sheldon,17, Really? I was thinking what we have now is a bit much.,7,Big Bang Theory,55,12
35188,Howard,17," Seriously, I was talking to Bernadette last night and she made some great points. You and I have known each other a long time, and I didn't hear the rest 'cause she took her bra off.",7,Big Bang Theory,183,36
35189,Sheldon,17, Very well. How do you propose we move forward?,7,Big Bang Theory,47,9
35190,Howard,17," Uh, for starters, we could stop insulting each other.",7,Big Bang Theory,54,9
35191,Sheldon,17," That's a great idea. And in the spirit of our new arrangement, I will mask my surprise that you came up with it.",7,Big Bang Theory,113,23
35192,Howard,17," Anyway, I got invited to do a little talk at NASA in Houston this weekend. They gave me two tickets. Bernadette can't go. You want to come with me? You can visit your mom, and I'll show you around the space centre.",7,Big Bang Theory,215,42
35193,Sheldon,17, I have one question. Is this a prank where we land in Houston and you've made up wanted posters that have my face with a moustache and a Spanish name and then I get arrested and deported to South America?,7,Big Bang Theory,205,40
35194,Howard,17, No.,7,Big Bang Theory,4,1
35195,Sheldon,17, I'm glad because I would not have seen that coming.,7,Big Bang Theory,52,10
35197,Raj,17," Amy, I could use some help.",7,Big Bang Theory,28,6
35198,Amy,17, Oh. Let me guess. There's an undergrad in a leather jacket snapping his fingers by the water fountain.,7,Big Bang Theory,103,18
35199,Raj,17," I thought about what you said last night, and I went back on the dating Web site and I was looking at this girl's profile. She's amazing.",7,Big Bang Theory,138,27
35200,Amy,17," Oh, she's cute. And smart. Phi Beta Kappa.",7,Big Bang Theory,43,8
35201,Raj,17," And judging by her lack of Adam's apple, she's been female her entire life. I like that in a woman.",7,Big Bang Theory,100,20
35202,Amy,17," Great, so what do you need me for?",7,Big Bang Theory,35,8
35203,Raj,17," Well, I was up all night trying to write to her, but I wanted to run it by you first.",7,Big Bang Theory,86,20
35204,Amy,17, All right.,7,Big Bang Theory,11,2
35205,Raj,17," Emily, your face is like a precious dew-kissed flower.",7,Big Bang Theory,55,9
35206,Amy,17, Wow.,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
35207,Raj,17," I know. Powerful stuff, huh?",7,Big Bang Theory,29,5
35208,Amy,17," No. You're supposed to be yourself, not all desperate and creepy.",7,Big Bang Theory,66,11
35209,Raj,17," Okay, I'm getting some mixed messages here.",7,Big Bang Theory,44,7
35210,Amy,17," Just say something normal like, I saw your profile. Looks like we have a lot in common, let's get a cup of coffee sometime.â€ù",7,Big Bang Theory,127,24
35211,Raj,17, Yes. Where I can be jealous of the cup touching your ruby lips. Or you just write it for me.,7,Big Bang Theory,93,20
35212,Amy,17, I'm not gonna pretend to be you.,7,Big Bang Theory,33,7
35213,Raj,17," I don't want you to pretend to be me. You can be like my, uh, online wingman. Like if we met her at a bar and you talked me up.",7,Big Bang Theory,128,30
35214,Amy,17," Well, what would I say to her?",7,Big Bang Theory,31,7
35215,Raj,17," Just tell her what I'm really like. And, if you think it'll help, that you saw me changing once and my package reminded you of the muscular tail of a jaguar. Use your own words.",7,Big Bang Theory,178,35
35217,Sheldon,17, Thanks again for taking me to the pharmacy.,7,Big Bang Theory,44,8
35218,Penny,17," Oh, it's no problem. Is everything okay?",7,Big Bang Theory,41,7
35219,Sheldon,17," Oh, I'm fine. It's just some, uh, stomach medication for my trip. There's the remote yet distinct possibility that I may end up in South America.",7,Big Bang Theory,146,26
35220,Penny,17," Remember the old days when I would've said something dumb like why? Uh, that doesn't sound good.",7,Big Bang Theory,97,17
35221,Sheldon,17, Remember the old days when I used to point out that your check engine light was on?,7,Big Bang Theory,84,17
35222,Penny,17, Yes.,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
35223,Sheldon,17," Well, get ready to stroll down memory lane. Penny, your check engine",7,Big Bang Theory,69,12
35224,Penny,17," Yeah, I know it's on, Sheldon. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I cannot afford this right now.",7,Big Bang Theory,87,18
35225,Sheldon,17," Maybe it's just something minor. Ooh, good news, the light just went out.",7,Big Bang Theory,74,13
35227,Leonard,17, Are we playing individual or teams?,7,Big Bang Theory,36,6
35228,Raj,17, Teams are fun.,7,Big Bang Theory,15,3
35229,Sheldon,17," Oh, in that case, I'd like to be partnered with my good friend Howard.",7,Big Bang Theory,71,14
35230,Raj,17, But I'm always on Howard's team. We're best friends. The kind who finish each others,7,Big Bang Theory,85,15
35231,Howard,17, I really don't think we do tha,7,Big Bang Theory,31,7
35232,Raj,17, Do that. See?,7,Big Bang Theory,14,3
35233,Penny,17," Oh, hi.",7,Big Bang Theory,8,2
35234,Leonard,17," Oh, how'd it go at the mechanic?",7,Big Bang Theory,33,7
35235,Penny,17, Not great. Can I talk to you for a sec?,7,Big Bang Theory,40,10
35236,Leonard,17," Yeah, sure.",7,Big Bang Theory,12,2
35237,Raj,17, Maybe I can go with you guys to Houston?,7,Big Bang Theory,41,9
35238,Howard,17, Isn't it a little late to get plane tick,7,Big Bang Theory,41,9
35239,Raj,17, Plane tickets? Yeah.,7,Big Bang Theory,21,3
35240,Howard,17, Will you please sto,7,Big Bang Theory,20,4
35241,Raj,17, Stop that? Okay.,7,Big Bang Theory,17,3
35243,Penny,17," I don't know what to do. My car threw a rod and it's totaled. I can't afford a new one, I have no job, and now I can't drive to auditions.",7,Big Bang Theory,139,31
35244,Leonard,17," I'm so sorry. I know it's a sensitive subject, but can you reconsider that part in the movie?",7,Big Bang Theory,94,18
35245,Penny,17, I did. I called them. The part's gone. They gave it to someone else. Now that girl's gonna get discovered and become famous and go on Letterman and talk about how she got her big break on a cheap monkey movie all because some dumb girl thought it was beneath her.,7,Big Bang Theory,264,51
35246,Leonard,17," At least they talked about you on Letterman. Come on, I can drive you wherever you need to go.",7,Big Bang Theory,95,19
35247,Penny,17," How? Unlike me, you have a job. I'm just gonna have to go back to being a waitress, like I will be for the rest of my life.",7,Big Bang Theory,124,28
35248,Sheldon,17," Leonard, would you wrap it up? We're waiting on you.",7,Big Bang Theory,53,10
35249,Penny,17," I'm sorry, is the fact that my life's falling apart interfering with your board game?",7,Big Bang Theory,86,15
35250,Sheldon,17," It is. You were wrong, friend Howard. She completely understood.",7,Big Bang Theory,65,10
35252,Raj,17," Hey, you busy?",7,Big Bang Theory,15,3
35253,Amy,17, No. What's up?,7,Big Bang Theory,15,3
35254,Raj,17, Have you heard back from Emily?,7,Big Bang Theory,32,6
35255,Amy,17, I have.,7,Big Bang Theory,8,2
35256,Raj,17, Great. And?,7,Big Bang Theory,12,2
35257,Amy,17, And I'm afraid she doesn't think you're right for her.,7,Big Bang Theory,55,10
35258,Raj,17," I give you one simple thing to do, contact a complete stranger and make her fall in love with me, and you blow it.",7,Big Bang Theory,115,24
35259,Amy,17," I told her what a good guy you are, but she thought it was a bad sign that you didn't write to her yourself. She thought it made you seem too shy and passive.",7,Big Bang Theory,159,34
35260,Raj,17," I'm not too shy and passive. You write her back and tell her I said that. You know, when you have a second.",7,Big Bang Theory,108,23
35261,Amy,17," Look, I'll see if I can change her mind tomorrow night.",7,Big Bang Theory,56,11
35262,Raj,17, What's happening tomorrow night?,7,Big Bang Theory,33,4
35263,Amy,17, I'm meeting her for coffee.,7,Big Bang Theory,28,5
35264,Raj,17, What?,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
35265,Amy,17," Well, we just, we e-mailed back and forth a bit, and we kind of hit it off.",7,Big Bang Theory,76,17
35266,Raj,17," I find a girl I like, and you're stealing her?",7,Big Bang Theory,47,10
35267,Amy,17," No. We just ended up having a lot in common. We went to Harvard, we like Chaucer, we're both hardcore into quilting.",7,Big Bang Theory,117,22
35268,Raj,17, Your words fall like acid rain on the wounded petals of my heart.,7,Big Bang Theory,66,13
35270,Howard,17, That's Sheldon. He says he'll be down in a minute.,7,Big Bang Theory,51,10
35272,Howard,17," Oh, he's not coming out until he sees proof you don't have an air freshener in your car.",7,Big Bang Theory,89,18
35274,Howard,17, You're the reason I'm doing it.,7,Big Bang Theory,32,6
35276,Howard,17, How do I know what you said? Damn you and your noise-cancelling breasts.,7,Big Bang Theory,73,13
35277,Sheldon,17, Hello.,7,Big Bang Theory,7,1
35279,Howard,17," Hey, buddy.",7,Big Bang Theory,12,2
35281,Sheldon,17," Oh, very much so.",7,Big Bang Theory,18,4
35282,Howard,17, It's not every day you get to tour NASA with a real astronaut.,7,Big Bang Theory,63,13
35283,Sheldon,17," Oh, who's the real astronaut?",7,Big Bang Theory,30,5
35284,Howard,17, Buzz Aldrin.,7,Big Bang Theory,13,2
35285,Sheldon,17, Oh. Yay.,7,Big Bang Theory,9,2
35287,Sheldon,17,  Howard?  Howard?  Howard?,7,Big Bang Theory,27,3
35288,Howard,17, What now?,7,Big Bang Theory,10,2
35289,Sheldon,17, I have to go to the bathroom.,7,Big Bang Theory,30,7
35290,Howard,17, You just went to the bathroom.,7,Big Bang Theory,31,6
35291,Sheldon,17," But I didn't use it because it didn't seem safe. Despite all my e-mails, the toilet didn't have a seatbelt.",7,Big Bang Theory,108,20
35292,Howard,17," Well, it still doesn't.",7,Big Bang Theory,24,4
35293,Sheldon,17," I realize that, but safety concerns went out the window two apple juices ago.",7,Big Bang Theory,78,14
35294,Howard,17, Fine.,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
35295,Sheldon,17, Why are you getting annoyed?,7,Big Bang Theory,29,5
35296,Howard,17," I'm trying to be a better friend, but you constantly say and do irritating things.",7,Big Bang Theory,83,15
35297,Sheldon,17, Like when?,7,Big Bang Theory,11,2
35298,Howard,17," When? How about in the car? I'm an astronaut, and you know it. You just don't like admitting it, because you're jealous.",7,Big Bang Theory,121,22
35299,Sheldon,17," Well, truth be told, as a child, I did dream of going to space. Those astronauts were my heroes. And when you got to go, it was hard for me.",7,Big Bang Theory,141,30
35300,Howard,17, Thank you.,7,Big Bang Theory,11,2
35301,Sheldon,17, Because it made me realize they'll just send anyone up there. Aren't you going to let me out?,7,Big Bang Theory,94,18
35302,Howard,17, No.,7,Big Bang Theory,4,1
35303,Sheldon,17, But I still need to use the bathroom.,7,Big Bang Theory,38,8
35304,Howard,17, Here you go. Be creative. What's the matter? Scared of a little turbulence?,7,Big Bang Theory,76,13
35305,Sheldon,17," No, turbulence is just the equalization of diurnal temperature variations in the atmosphere. I'm not scared at all. Oh, apple juice, stay where you are.",7,Big Bang Theory,153,25
35306,Howard,17," Oh, this is nothing. I experienced way worse when I was plummeting back to Earth, apparently not being a real astronaut. Okay, that was a big one.",7,Big Bang Theory,147,27
35307,Sheldon,17, I take it back. I'm scared of turbulence!,7,Big Bang Theory,42,8
35308,Howard,17, I'm gonna need that bag back.,7,Big Bang Theory,30,6
35310,Leonard,17, You sure you want to do this?,7,Big Bang Theory,30,7
35311,Penny,17," Yeah. Why wouldn't I want to get my old job back? It'll be fun to see everyone. I haven't talked to them since I said I quit, see you at the Oscars, bitches. Come on, let's just get this over with.",7,Big Bang Theory,198,41
35312,Leonard,17," Let's get this over with. Am I driving you to the Cheesecake Factory, or are we having sex? I'm just, I'm trying to lighten the mood.",7,Big Bang Theory,134,26
35313,Penny,17, I know. Thank you.,7,Big Bang Theory,19,4
35314,Leonard,17, Sorry.,7,Big Bang Theory,7,1
35315,Penny,17, It's just so humiliating.,7,Big Bang Theory,26,4
35316,Leonard,17, So humiliating? Am I driving you to the Cheesecake Factory? I'm sorry. I'll. I'll stop. I'll stop.,7,Big Bang Theory,99,17
35318,Leonard,17," Come on, don't look so sad. You never know what's gonna happen. Maybe tonight will be great.",7,Big Bang Theory,93,17
35319,Penny,17," Sweetie, I know you're trying to make me feel better, and I love you for that, but it's making me feel worse, and I kind of hate you. This isn't your car.",7,Big Bang Theory,155,32
35320,Leonard,17, I know. I thought we'd take yours.,7,Big Bang Theory,35,7
35321,Penny,17, I don't understand.,7,Big Bang Theory,20,3
35322,Leonard,17," It's nothing fancy, but it'll get you to auditions, and at least for now, you don't have to go back to waitressing.",7,Big Bang Theory,116,22
35323,Penny,17, I don't know what to say.,7,Big Bang Theory,26,6
35324,Leonard,17, Don't say anything.,7,Big Bang Theory,20,3
35325,Penny,17," Oh, my God.",7,Big Bang Theory,12,3
35326,Leonard,17," I mean, you could say thank you. I did just buy you a car.",7,Big Bang Theory,59,14
35328,Amy,17," Look, I admit that it's odd that Rajesh didn't write to you himself, but if you get to know him, you'll see he's just a sweet, regular guy. As a counterpoint, here he is, uninvited and visibly sweaty.",7,Big Bang Theory,201,38
35329,Raj,17," Hello, Emily.",7,Big Bang Theory,14,2
35331,Raj,17," Amy told me you were concerned that I might be too passive and shy. Let me ask you something. Would a passive guy barge in here to look you in the eye and say, hey, dew-kissed flower, what's up?",7,Big Bang Theory,195,39
35333,Raj,17," Uh, okay, that's a separate issue. Let's put a pin in that and just focus on the passive thing.",7,Big Bang Theory,96,19
35335,Amy,17, Are we still going to go to that Chaucer reading Friday?,7,Big Bang Theory,57,11
35337,Raj,17," Not my best first date. Yeah, but not my worst, either.",7,Big Bang Theory,56,11
35339,Sheldon,17, I'm sorry for every mean thing I ever did or said to you.,7,Big Bang Theory,58,13
35340,Howard,17," I'm sorry, too. It's all my fault.",7,Big Bang Theory,35,7
35341,Sheldon,17," If you weren't my friend, there'd be a hole in my life.",7,Big Bang Theory,56,12
35342,Howard,17," Thank you, Sheldon.",7,Big Bang Theory,20,3
35343,Sheldon,17, Kind of like when Firefly was cancelled. But not as big.,7,Big Bang Theory,57,11
35345,Howard,17, It's over.,7,Big Bang Theory,11,2
35346,Sheldon,17, Yeah.,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
35347,Howard,17, Should we stop holding hands now?,7,Big Bang Theory,34,6
35348,Sheldon,17, In a minute.,7,Big Bang Theory,13,3
35349,Howard,17," Okay, good.",7,Big Bang Theory,12,2
35351,Amy,18, Should you really be sitting in Sheldon's spot?,7,Big Bang Theory,48,8
35352,Raj,18," He's in Texas, he'll never know.",7,Big Bang Theory,33,6
35353,Penny,18, I wouldn't be so sure about that.,7,Big Bang Theory,34,7
35354,Leonard,18," Yeah, he has a very sensitive butt. Well, it's true. Once I saw him sit on a bunch of loose change and add it up.",7,Big Bang Theory,114,25
35355,Raj,18, Have you heard from Howard?,7,Big Bang Theory,28,5
35357,Penny,18, Sheldon didn't heckle him?,7,Big Bang Theory,27,4
35360,Amy,18," Oh, hi.",7,Big Bang Theory,8,2
35362,Raj,18," Hey, Stuart!",7,Big Bang Theory,13,2
35364,Raj,18," Good. Sheldon's out of town, so we can do whatever we want. We even ordered from the Thai place he doesn't like.",7,Big Bang Theory,113,22
35366,Penny,18, Disgusting. Do not tell him.,7,Big Bang Theory,29,5
35367,Leonard,18, What do you guys want to do tonight?,7,Big Bang Theory,37,8
35368,Amy,18, I don't know.,7,Big Bang Theory,14,3
35370,Raj,18, Stuart? Are you okay?,7,Big Bang Theory,22,4
35372,Leonard,18," Oh, my God, Stuart?",7,Big Bang Theory,20,4
35373,Penny,18," Oh, my God, you guys need to do something!",7,Big Bang Theory,43,9
35374,Raj,18, Stuart?,7,Big Bang Theory,8,1
35375,Leonard,18, Calling 911.,7,Big Bang Theory,13,2
35376,Raj,18," Well, it's too late.",7,Big Bang Theory,21,4
35377,Leonard,18, What do you mean it's too late?,7,Big Bang Theory,32,7
35378,Raj,18, He's been murdered by someone in this room.,7,Big Bang Theory,44,8
35379,Penny,18," Oh, my God.",7,Big Bang Theory,12,3
35380,Leonard,18," Oh, come on.",7,Big Bang Theory,13,3
35381,Raj,18, Welcome to another classic Koothrappali murder mystery dinner.,7,Big Bang Theory,63,8
35382,Amy,18, I'm leaving.,7,Big Bang Theory,13,2
35383,Raj,18, You can't leave. You're a suspect in the mysterious murder of Stuart Bloom.,7,Big Bang Theory,76,13
35385,Amy,18," Yeah, it's Bloom.",7,Big Bang Theory,18,3
35386,Penny,18, Are you really gonna lie on the floor and pretend to be dead all night?,7,Big Bang Theory,72,15
35389,Penny,18, Are you gonna make us pretend to be a bunch of lame characters with silly accents?,7,Big Bang Theory,83,16
35390,Raj,18," Lame characters with silly ac, what kind of actress are you?",7,Big Bang Theory,61,11
35391,Penny,18," You're right, I'm sorry. Sounds like fun.",7,Big Bang Theory,42,7
35392,Raj,18, Thank you.,7,Big Bang Theory,11,2
35393,Penny,18, That kind of actress. This sucks.,7,Big Bang Theory,34,6
35394,Leonard,18," Come on, guys. Raj put a lot of effort into this. And that's great. It's not sad, it's great.",7,Big Bang Theory,94,19
35395,Amy,18, I think it might be fun to be someone else tonight.,7,Big Bang Theory,52,11
35396,Raj,18," Actually, you're all just gonna be yourselves.",7,Big Bang Theory,47,7
35397,Amy,18," Oh, ugh.",7,Big Bang Theory,9,2
35399,Raj,18," Very good, Bernadette. You are a regular Byomkesh Bakshi.",7,Big Bang Theory,58,9
35401,Raj,18, Or is Sherlock Holmes the English Byomkesh Bakshi?,7,Big Bang Theory,51,8
35402,Amy,18," According to Wikipedia, Sherlock Holmes came first.",7,Big Bang Theory,52,7
35403,Raj,18," Great, everyone's a Byomkesh Bakshi. Now, here are some secret facts about each of you, including whether you are the murderer. Throughout the game, feel free to ask each other questions to uncover clues.",7,Big Bang Theory,205,34
35404,Penny,18," Got it. Hey, who's the murderer?",7,Big Bang Theory,33,6
35405,Raj,18, Any question but that.,7,Big Bang Theory,23,4
35406,Penny,18," Sorry. Hey, who's not the murderer?",7,Big Bang Theory,36,6
35411,Sheldon,18, Thank you for my bobble head.,7,Big Bang Theory,30,6
35412,Howard,18, Thank you for not making fun of me during my speech.,7,Big Bang Theory,53,11
35413,Sheldon,18, It wasn't easy. Was it Buzz?,7,Big Bang Theory,29,6
35414,Howard,18, We can't show up to your mom's empty-handed. We should bring something.,7,Big Bang Theory,72,12
35415,Sheldon,18, I already am. I'm bringing the gift of knowledge.,7,Big Bang Theory,50,9
35416,Howard,18," Oh, boy.",7,Big Bang Theory,9,2
35417,Sheldon,18," Despite what her Bible says, recent archaeological studies indicate that although camels are referenced in the Old Testament, they didn't exist in the Middle East until hundreds of years later.",7,Big Bang Theory,194,30
35418,Howard,18, I was gonna say we pick up a cake or a pie. But an insult to her faith is always thoughtful.,7,Big Bang Theory,93,21
35421,Raj,18, I can't tell you that. But perhaps the killer dropped a fun and imaginative clue somewhere in the apartment.,7,Big Bang Theory,109,19
35422,Penny,18," Ooh, I'm gonna check the fridge, and see if there are any clues inside a beer.",7,Big Bang Theory,79,16
35423,Amy,18," Hey, I found something. It looks like a little man with a briefcase.",7,Big Bang Theory,69,13
35424,Leonard,18," Oh, no, no. That's Clarence Darrow. It's from a game Sheldon made up called Chutes and Lawyers. You slide down a chute and then work your way back up through the appellate system.",7,Big Bang Theory,180,33
35425,Raj,18," Well, unlike that, my games are much more fun.",7,Big Bang Theory,47,9
35426,Penny,18," Okay, can I ask you something? Why do you like making us do this stuff?",7,Big Bang Theory,72,15
35427,Raj,18," Well, I guess it goes back to when I was a fat kid in India, and didn't have any friends.",7,Big Bang Theory,90,20
35429,Raj,18," Yeah, I was. I was 200 pounds by the time I was in middle school. Kids were mean. Cows may be sacred there, but it doesn't help if you look like one. Anyway, I was pretty lonely, so I had to make up my own stories and games, and I promised myself if I ever made any friends that, that I would play those games with them.",7,Big Bang Theory,321,67
35430,Amy,18, That is so sweet.,7,Big Bang Theory,18,4
35431,Leonard,18, I've seen old pictures of you. You were never a fat kid.,7,Big Bang Theory,57,12
35432,Raj,18," No, I was svelte as a gazelle. A gazelle blessed with a flair for storytelling.",7,Big Bang Theory,80,15
35434,Amy,18, What's it for?,7,Big Bang Theory,15,3
35436,Raj,18, From the future? How fun and imaginative.,7,Big Bang Theory,42,7
35437,Leonard,18, So one of us came back from the future to murder Stuart?,7,Big Bang Theory,57,12
35438,Raj,18, Correct.,7,Big Bang Theory,9,1
35439,Leonard,18, Does the gazelle with a flair for storytelling know he's just ripping off Terminator?,7,Big Bang Theory,86,14
35440,Raj,18," Does the smart-ass know that Terminator was actually ripped off from an Outer Limits script called Demon With a Glass Hand, by Harlan Ellison?",7,Big Bang Theory,143,24
35441,Leonard,18," Oh, does the gazelle know that according to Harlan Ellison, it was not ripped off from Demon With a Glass Hand, but was ripped off from another Outer Limits script he wrote called The Soldier?",7,Big Bang Theory,193,35
35442,Penny,18, I'm gonna need another clue.,7,Big Bang Theory,29,5
35444,Howard,18," Okay, give me the flowers and pie.",7,Big Bang Theory,35,7
35445,Sheldon,18," But if we show up and you're holding them, she'll think they're only from you.",7,Big Bang Theory,79,15
35446,Howard,18, They are only from me. You said the gift of you was enough.,7,Big Bang Theory,60,13
35447,Sheldon,18," Yes, but now that I've seen what the gift of me with flowers and pie looks like, there's no going back. Boy, I can't wait to see the look on her face. We're leaving right now.",7,Big Bang Theory,176,36
35448,Howard,18, What's wrong?,7,Big Bang Theory,14,2
35449,Sheldon,18, Nothing.,7,Big Bang Theory,9,1
35450,Howard,18," What? Sheldon, tell me what's going on.",7,Big Bang Theory,40,7
35451,Sheldon,18, I saw my mommy with a naked man and she was trying to be a mommy again.,7,Big Bang Theory,72,17
35453,Howard,18, You ready to talk about it?,7,Big Bang Theory,28,6
35454,Sheldon,18, I'm not nearly drunk enough. Okay. Do you have any idea what it's like to see your mother ravaging someone?,7,Big Bang Theory,108,20
35455,Howard,18," Does a brisket count? I'm sorry, buddy, that's rough. But didn't she know we were coming?",7,Big Bang Theory,90,16
35456,Sheldon,18, No. I wanted to surprise her. What am I supposed to say to her after something like this?,7,Big Bang Theory,90,18
35457,Howard,18," Well, did she see you in the window?",7,Big Bang Theory,37,8
35458,Sheldon,18, No.,7,Big Bang Theory,4,1
35459,Howard,18, Then don't say anything.,7,Big Bang Theory,25,4
35460,Sheldon,18," I have to. How can we ever hope to have a healthy relationship if I don't tell her how disappointed I am, and that I'll never forgive her?",7,Big Bang Theory,139,28
35461,Howard,18," Well, don't do it on the phone.",7,Big Bang Theory,32,7
35462,Sheldon,18," No, I'm just going to tell her I'm coming so she can give that good time Charlie the heave-ho.",7,Big Bang Theory,95,19
35463,Howard,18," That's some tough talk, I may need to cut you off.",7,Big Bang Theory,51,11
35464,Sheldon,18," Yeah, maybe you better, I took a pretty big sip.",7,Big Bang Theory,49,10
35465,Howard,18," Look, she's a grown woman. And, and your dad's been gone a long time. Maybe this is none of your business.",7,Big Bang Theory,107,21
35466,Sheldon,18," I beg to differ. I used to live in those genitals. And if someone wants to move into my old room, I should at least get a vote.",7,Big Bang Theory,128,28
35468,Raj,18," Okay, murder suspects, Leonard has found the time machine the killer must've used. You're all inside it, and we hurtle through the very fabric of time. And welcome to 20 years in the future. Hey, you guys just time-travelled. Stop looking so bored.",7,Big Bang Theory,249,43
35469,Penny,18," Well, my beer isn't flat and my rack's not saggy. So far, the future's great.",7,Big Bang Theory,78,15
35471,Raj,18," Fine, just try not to look too alive.",7,Big Bang Theory,38,8
35474,Amy,18, But why?,7,Big Bang Theory,9,2
35475,Raj,18, Perhaps this will help. Here are some facts about yourselves in the future that might contain a clue.,7,Big Bang Theory,102,18
35476,Amy,18," Hey, I won the Nobel Prize in physiology, then I used the money to buy Stuart's comic book store, and close it down so Sheldon would pay attention to me. Not the worst idea.",7,Big Bang Theory,174,34
35477,Penny,18," Hey, I'm a famous actress living in London.",7,Big Bang Theory,44,8
35478,Leonard,18," Hmm, I'm a professor at Stanford.",7,Big Bang Theory,34,6
35479,Penny,18, Hmm.,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
35481,Raj,18," Oh, no. In this game, as your careers both took off, you drifted apart. Kind of like how future me lost touch with you guys after I became boy toy for the wrinkled, but still flexible, Madonna.",7,Big Bang Theory,194,37
35482,Amy,18," What does your card say, Bernadette?",7,Big Bang Theory,37,6
35483,Leonard,18," Uh, uh, uh, hang on. Do you think we'd really drift apart if we both became successful?",7,Big Bang Theory,88,17
35484,Penny,18," Of course not. If I became a famous actress and had to move, you would just come with me.",7,Big Bang Theory,90,19
35485,Leonard,18," But if I get a chance to be a tenured professor, I might not have that much choice in where I end up.",7,Big Bang Theory,102,23
35486,Penny,18," Yeah, but if I become a successful actress, we wouldn't need the money.",7,Big Bang Theory,72,13
35487,Leonard,18," Well, you don't go into science for the money.",7,Big Bang Theory,47,9
35489,Penny,18," So, wait, if my career took me somewhere else, you might not go?",7,Big Bang Theory,65,13
35490,Amy,18," Dun, dun, dun. He started it.",7,Big Bang Theory,30,6
35491,Raj,18," Okay, okay, guys, new back stories. Uh, Penny and Leonard, you two lovebirds are super successful and living in New York. Uh, you're an actress, you're a professor and you have three beautiful kids.",7,Big Bang Theory,199,34
35492,Leonard,18, Great.,7,Big Bang Theory,7,1
35493,Penny,18, Really? You think I'm putting this body through three kids?,7,Big Bang Theory,60,10
35495,Sheldon,18," Okay, let's do this.",7,Big Bang Theory,21,4
35496,Howard,18, Good luck.,7,Big Bang Theory,11,2
35497,Sheldon,18," You, aren't you gonna come with me?",7,Big Bang Theory,36,7
35498,Howard,18, While you confront your mother about her sex life? I'd rather go back to that bar in ass-less chaps.,7,Big Bang Theory,101,19
35499,Sheldon,18,  Mother?  Mother?  Mother?,7,Big Bang Theory,27,3
35501,Sheldon,18, I saw you having naked sex.,7,Big Bang Theory,28,6
35503,Sheldon,18," Earlier, I came here to surprise you. I looked in the window and I saw you with a man.",7,Big Bang Theory,87,19
35505,Sheldon,18, Can you recommend a surface you haven't had coitus on?,7,Big Bang Theory,55,10
35507,Sheldon,18, Who was he?,7,Big Bang Theory,12,3
35509,Sheldon,18, How long have you been involved with him?,7,Big Bang Theory,42,8
35511,Sheldon,18," And of those few months, how long have you been a demented sex pervert?",7,Big Bang Theory,72,14
35513,Sheldon,18," Perhaps not. But it is a way to speak to a woman who quoted the Bible to me my whole life, and then desecrates one of Ethan Allen's finest sofas.",7,Big Bang Theory,146,30
35515,Sheldon,18, Or what?,7,Big Bang Theory,9,2
35517,Sheldon,18, That's ridiculous. I am a grown man. I am a professional scientist. And I currently occupy the moral high ground.,7,Big Bang Theory,114,20
35519,Sheldon,18, But I occupy the moral high ground.,7,Big Bang Theory,36,7
35521,Sheldon,18, But I'm a professional scientist.,7,Big Bang Theory,34,5
35523,Sheldon,18, I'm a grown man.,7,Big Bang Theory,17,4
35525,Raj,18, Can we please get back to the game?,7,Big Bang Theory,36,8
35526,Leonard,18, In a minute. I don't understand why any success you have in acting is more important than any I have in science.,7,Big Bang Theory,113,22
35527,Penny,18," Okay, if you do something cool in science, you might change the world. If I become a famous actress, I'm not gonna tell you why movie stars are the best. They just are.",7,Big Bang Theory,169,33
35528,Amy,18, I'm surprised you guys never talked about this stuff.,7,Big Bang Theory,54,9
35529,Leonard,18, Like you and Sheldon have everything figured out?,7,Big Bang Theory,50,8
35530,Amy,18," Actually, our relationship agreement covers a wide array of scenarios, including career changes, financial instability, intelligent dog uprising. FYI, we plan on selling out the human race hard.",7,Big Bang Theory,195,28
35531,Penny,18," In 20 years, who knows what'll happen with any of us?",7,Big Bang Theory,54,11
35533,Penny,18, You do?,7,Big Bang Theory,8,2
35535,Leonard,18, Aw.,7,Big Bang Theory,4,1
35536,Penny,18, That's so sweet.,7,Big Bang Theory,17,3
35538,Amy,18, Excuse me?,7,Big Bang Theory,11,2
35539,Penny,18," Ah-da-da-da-da, let the dead man talk. So, why do you think that?",7,Big Bang Theory,66,12
35541,Penny,18," Aw, Stuart. Now I feel bad for murdering you.",7,Big Bang Theory,46,9
35542,Raj,18," Oh, come on.",7,Big Bang Theory,13,3
35545,Howard,18," Hey, can I come in?",7,Big Bang Theory,20,5
35546,Sheldon,18, Apparently any man is welcome in this house. Why not you? I thought you were waiting in the car.,7,Big Bang Theory,97,19
35547,Howard,18," That was an hour ago, Sheldon. A Jew sits in front of a house in Texas that long, For Sale signs start to go up. I take it things didn't go smoothly with your mom.",7,Big Bang Theory,164,35
35548,Sheldon,18, No. I'm not sure how we're going to get past this.,7,Big Bang Theory,51,11
35549,Howard,18," You know, I, I sort of went through something like this myself.",7,Big Bang Theory,64,12
35550,Sheldon,18," Howard, we've all seen your mother naked. That woman needs to learn how to tie a robe.",7,Big Bang Theory,87,17
35551,Howard,18, I'm talking about when my mom started seeing someone a couple of years after my dad left.,7,Big Bang Theory,90,17
35552,Sheldon,18, I didn't know she did.,7,Big Bang Theory,23,5
35553,Howard,18," Yeah, she was dating this guy, and I was kind of a jerk to her about it.",7,Big Bang Theory,73,17
35554,Sheldon,18, What did you do?,7,Big Bang Theory,17,4
35555,Howard,18," Well, let's just say it was the most vicious bar mitzvah speech in the history of Temple Beth El. Anyway, she broke up with him. And she's basically been alone ever since. She never said it, but I always felt I was the reason why.",7,Big Bang Theory,231,45
35556,Sheldon,18," I'm sorry. Although, based on your story, you absolutely were the reason why.",7,Big Bang Theory,78,13
35557,Howard,18, All I'm saying is you might not want to get in the way of your mom's happiness.,7,Big Bang Theory,80,17
35558,Sheldon,18, You may have a point. I love my mother. Even if she fornicates like a demonic weasel.,7,Big Bang Theory,86,17
35559,Howard,18, And the healing begins.,7,Big Bang Theory,24,4
35561,Sheldon,18, Hello.,7,Big Bang Theory,7,1
35563,Sheldon,18, I am.,7,Big Bang Theory,6,2
35565,Sheldon,18," I think what most upsets me about it, Mother, is the hypocrisy. Doesn't this contradict all the religious rules you've been espousing your whole life?",7,Big Bang Theory,151,25
35567,Sheldon,18, Then why are you doing it?,7,Big Bang Theory,27,6
35569,Sheldon,18," Well, this is confusing for me. But I don't want to stand in the way of your happiness. So, I'll condemn you internally while maintaining an outward appearance of acceptance.",7,Big Bang Theory,175,30
35571,Sheldon,18," Mother, if you're going to conduct your life in this fashion, then I should let you know that the world has changed since you were a young woman. You know, it's not all sock hops, soda jerks and segregation anymore.",7,Big Bang Theory,216,40
35573,Sheldon,18," My point is that you're going to need to be careful. You used to be protected by your pre-Enlightenment mythology, but now you're going to need a stronger friend named latex.",7,Big Bang Theory,175,31
35575,Sheldon,18," Well, someone has to.",7,Big Bang Theory,22,4
35577,Sheldon,18," No, don't look to Him. He's mad at you right now.",7,Big Bang Theory,50,11
35579,Penny,18," Oh, come on, don't pout. I'm sorry I ruined your game.",7,Big Bang Theory,55,11
35580,Raj,18," I'm not pouting, I'm brooding. Which is how sexy men pout.",7,Big Bang Theory,59,11
35581,Amy,18, It actually was kind of fun.,7,Big Bang Theory,29,6
35582,Raj,18, You're just saying that.,7,Big Bang Theory,25,4
35583,Amy,18, Yeah.,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
35585,Raj,18, Thank you. I thought it was inspired.,7,Big Bang Theory,38,7
35586,Leonard,18, It was. By Terminator.,7,Big Bang Theory,23,4
35588,Penny,18, Definitely.,7,Big Bang Theory,12,1
35590,Penny,18, I love it.,7,Big Bang Theory,11,3
35591,Leonard,18, Putting it in my phone right now.,7,Big Bang Theory,34,7
35592,Penny,18," Yeah, me, too.",7,Big Bang Theory,15,3
35594,Raj,18, And it's done.,7,Big Bang Theory,15,3
35595,Penny,18," Yup, we're all in.",7,Big Bang Theory,19,4
35596,Leonard,18," All right, I'll see you guys in 20 years.",7,Big Bang Theory,42,9
35600,Sheldon,19," Boy, do I have to urinate.",7,Big Bang Theory,27,6
35601,Leonard,19, If only there were a solution to that.,7,Big Bang Theory,39,8
35602,Sheldon,19, Seriously. I feel like I've got a fish tank in my pelvis.,7,Big Bang Theory,58,12
35603,Leonard,19, So go to the bathroom.,7,Big Bang Theory,23,5
35604,Sheldon,19, I can't.,7,Big Bang Theory,9,2
35605,Leonard,19, Why not?,7,Big Bang Theory,9,2
35606,Sheldon,19," Because I'm trying to decide between getting an Xbox One or a PS4. Oh, pee, why'd I say that?",7,Big Bang Theory,94,19
35607,Leonard,19," Forgive me for asking a stupid question, but why are you being stupid?",7,Big Bang Theory,71,13
35608,Sheldon,19," I'm not being stupid. I'm employing the work of Dutch researcher, Mirjam Tuk, who found that people with full bladders make better decisions.",7,Big Bang Theory,142,23
35609,Leonard,19, Why did I pee before I decided to move in here?,7,Big Bang Theory,48,11
35610,Penny,19, Hi.,7,Big Bang Theory,4,1
35611,Leonard,19," Hey. Oh, how'd the audition go?",7,Big Bang Theory,32,6
35612,Penny,19, I killed it. I was even able to cry real tears right on the spot.,7,Big Bang Theory,66,15
35613,Leonard,19," Oh, that's great.",7,Big Bang Theory,18,3
35614,Penny,19," I know. Next time I get pulled over for a speeding ticket, here come the waterworks.",7,Big Bang Theory,85,16
35615,Sheldon,19, Here come the waterworks.,7,Big Bang Theory,26,4
35616,Leonard,19, Aren't you gonna ask?,7,Big Bang Theory,22,4
35617,Penny,19," What is this, my first day?",7,Big Bang Theory,28,6
35620,Penny,19," Yeah, sure.",7,Big Bang Theory,12,2
35621,Amy,19, Of course.,7,Big Bang Theory,11,2
35623,Amy,19, I'm sure it's lovable.,7,Big Bang Theory,23,4
35624,Penny,19, I'm gonna go with monster. What do you got?,7,Big Bang Theory,44,9
35626,Amy,19, Okay.,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
35628,Penny,19, I'm liking my odds here.,7,Big Bang Theory,25,5
35630,Penny,19, No.,7,Big Bang Theory,4,1
35632,Amy,19," Oh, my gosh.",7,Big Bang Theory,13,3
35634,Penny,19," Oh. Why didn't I put money on this?  Hey, that's my agent. If I got the part, it's still the second best thing I've heard all day. Hello?",7,Big Bang Theory,138,28
35636,Amy,19," No. No, it was a mistake.",7,Big Bang Theory,26,6
35638,Amy,19, Now I think you're flirting with the line. Good news?,7,Big Bang Theory,54,10
35639,Penny,19," No, I didn't get it.",7,Big Bang Theory,21,5
35641,Amy,19, You'll get offered something soon.,7,Big Bang Theory,35,5
35642,Penny,19," I kind of did. The part in that awful horror movie I passed on came back around. Apparently, it's mine if I want it.",7,Big Bang Theory,117,24
35644,Penny,19, I don't know what to do.,7,Big Bang Theory,25,6
35645,Amy,19," Maybe you'll get hit by a car and die. LOL, right?",7,Big Bang Theory,51,11
35647,Raj,19," Hey. Emily, right?",7,Big Bang Theory,19,3
35649,Raj,19," I, I don't know if you remember me.",7,Big Bang Theory,36,8
35651,Raj,19," Yes, Rajesh Koothrappali. Look, uh, I just, I wanted to say I'm sorry. Okay? You were, like, the coolest person I ever found online, and I got really nervous and I, I just blew it.",7,Big Bang Theory,181,35
35653,Raj,19," Well, give me a chance, you don't even know me.",7,Big Bang Theory,48,10
35655,Raj,19," Ah, really? Thank you. Fate has given me a rare second chance, and I swear to Vishnu I'm not gonna blow it. Or normal words followed by a charming smile.",7,Big Bang Theory,154,30
35657,Sheldon,19," So, first there was PlayStation, aka PS1, then PS2, PS3 and now PS4. And that makes sense. You'd think after Xbox, there'd be Xbox 2. But no, next came Xbox 360. Hmm? And now, after 360, comes Xbox One. Why one? Maybe that's how many seconds of thought they put into naming it.",7,Big Bang Theory,278,53
35658,Amy,19," Can you get the butter, please?",7,Big Bang Theory,32,6
35659,Sheldon,19," You know, however, with the Xbox One, I can control my entire entertainment system using voice commands. Up until now, I've had to use Leonard.",7,Big Bang Theory,144,25
35660,Amy,19, Then get the other one. Pass the butter.,7,Big Bang Theory,41,8
35661,Sheldon,19, Get? Hang on. I don't feel like you're taking this dilemma seriously.,7,Big Bang Theory,70,12
35662,Amy,19," Fine, Sheldon. You have my undivided attention.",7,Big Bang Theory,48,7
35663,Sheldon,19," Okay, now, the PS4 is more angular and sleek-looking.",7,Big Bang Theory,54,9
35664,Amy,19, No way.,7,Big Bang Theory,8,2
35665,Sheldon,19," Yeah, well, it's true. But the larger size of the Xbox One may keep it from overheating.",7,Big Bang Theory,89,17
35666,Amy,19," Well, you wouldn't want your gaming system to overheat.",7,Big Bang Theory,56,9
35667,Sheldon,19," No, see? Well, you absolutely would not. And furthermore, the Xbox One now comes with a Kinect included.",7,Big Bang Theory,105,18
35668,Amy,19, Included?,7,Big Bang Theory,10,1
35669,Sheldon,19," Yes. Not sold separately. Although the PS4 uses cool new GDDR5 RAM, while the Xbox One is still using the conventional DDR3 memory.",7,Big Bang Theory,132,23
35670,Amy,19, Why would they still be using DDR3? Are they nuts?,7,Big Bang Theory,51,10
35671,Sheldon,19, See? That's what I thought. But then they go and throw in an ESRAM buffer.,7,Big Bang Theory,75,15
35672,Amy,19," Whoa, whoa. Wait a second. Who's they?",7,Big Bang Theory,39,7
35673,Sheldon,19, Xbox.,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
35674,Amy,19, You're kidding.,7,Big Bang Theory,16,2
35675,Sheldon,19," No, I am not. And this ESRAM buffer should totally bridge the 100-gigabit-per-second bandwidth gap between the two RAM types.",7,Big Bang Theory,126,20
35676,Amy,19, This is a nightmare. How will you ever make a decision?,7,Big Bang Theory,56,11
35677,Amy,19, Please pass the butter!,7,Big Bang Theory,24,4
35679,Penny,19," Okay, it's not me, right? This script is terrible.",7,Big Bang Theory,51,9
35680,Penny,19," Okay.  Sometimes I feel like I can control the killer gorilla instinct inside of me, but then I see these bananas and I just want to eat them and then kill people. What am I gonna do?",7,Big Bang Theory,184,37
35681,Leonard,19," Well, for starters, I wouldn't eat the bananas.",7,Big Bang Theory,48,8
35682,Penny,19," No, come on. This is serious.",7,Big Bang Theory,30,6
35683,Leonard,19," Uh, uh, does it at least pay well?",7,Big Bang Theory,35,8
35684,Penny,19, Less than I was making at The Cheesecake Factory.,7,Big Bang Theory,50,9
35685,Leonard,19, What does your agent think?,7,Big Bang Theory,28,5
35686,Penny,19, She's thinking of taking a job at The Cheesecake Factory.,7,Big Bang Theory,58,10
35687,Leonard,19," You know what, why don't you just do it? You'll go have fun for a few weeks, make some money, and who knows what it might lead to?",7,Big Bang Theory,131,28
35688,Penny,19," Okay, look, here, page 58. I oil-wrestle an orang-utan in a bikini.",7,Big Bang Theory,68,12
35689,Leonard,19," Just to clarify, which one of you is wearing the bikini?",7,Big Bang Theory,57,11
35690,Penny,19, Both of us.,7,Big Bang Theory,12,3
35691,Leonard,19, So it's a family film.,7,Big Bang Theory,23,5
35693,Sheldon,19, Thank you again for dinner.,7,Big Bang Theory,28,5
35694,Amy,19, You're welcome.,7,Big Bang Theory,16,2
35695,Sheldon,19, Good night.,7,Big Bang Theory,12,2
35696,Amy,19," Uh, it's date night. Aren't you, uh, forgetting something?",7,Big Bang Theory,59,9
35697,Sheldon,19," Oh, of course.  Did I mention the PS4 controllers light up?",7,Big Bang Theory,60,11
35698,Amy,19, No.,7,Big Bang Theory,4,1
35699,Sheldon,19," Well, they do.",7,Big Bang Theory,15,3
35701,Raj,19," And then after coffee, we went for a walk and she told me she always thought people from India were exotic and mysterious. So, with my mouth, I said, we're just like anybody else, but with my eyes, I said, straight up, Red, hop on my flying carpet.",7,Big Bang Theory,249,48
35702,Leonard,19," So, are you gonna see her again?",7,Big Bang Theory,33,7
35703,Raj,19," Yeah, we have plans this weekend. And if it's a clear night, I'm gonna lay some romantic astronomy on her.",7,Big Bang Theory,107,20
35704,Penny,19," Okay, like what? Show me.",7,Big Bang Theory,26,5
35705,Raj,19, I can't do that to Leonard. This is some powerful panty-dropping stuff.,7,Big Bang Theory,72,12
35706,Leonard,19, You have my blessing. Go for it.,7,Big Bang Theory,33,7
35707,Raj,19," Okay. Penny, two of the brightest stars in the night sky are Altair and Vega. And it is said they were deeply in love but forever separated by the celestial river of the Milky Way.",7,Big Bang Theory,181,35
35708,Penny,19," Oh, that's sad.",7,Big Bang Theory,16,3
35709,Raj,19," It is. But once a year, on the seventh day of the seventh month, Vega cries so hard that all the magpies in the world fly up and create a bridge with their wings so the two lovers can be together for a single night of passion.",7,Big Bang Theory,227,47
35710,Penny,19, Wow.,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
35711,Leonard,19," Okay, that's enough.",7,Big Bang Theory,21,3
35712,Sheldon,19," Quick poll, PS4 or Xbox One? Raj?",7,Big Bang Theory,34,7
35713,Raj,19," Uh, Xbox One.",7,Big Bang Theory,14,3
35714,Sheldon,19, Penny?,7,Big Bang Theory,7,1
35715,Penny,19, Huh?,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
35716,Sheldon,19, Leonard?,7,Big Bang Theory,9,1
35717,Leonard,19, PS4.,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
35718,Sheldon,19, Wolowitz?,7,Big Bang Theory,10,1
35719,Howard,19, Both great.,7,Big Bang Theory,12,2
35720,Sheldon,19, Bernadette?,7,Big Bang Theory,12,1
35722,Sheldon,19," Thanks, Grandma.",7,Big Bang Theory,17,2
35723,Raj,19," Oh, my goodness.",7,Big Bang Theory,17,3
35724,Leonard,19, What's up?,7,Big Bang Theory,11,2
35725,Raj,19, I just got an e-mail from my ex-girlfriend Lucy. She misses me and wants to get together.,7,Big Bang Theory,90,17
35726,Leonard,19," Two women at the same time? Nice job, playa.",7,Big Bang Theory,45,9
35727,Penny,19, Really?,7,Big Bang Theory,8,1
35728,Leonard,19, Was it the two women thing or the playa? It was the playa.,7,Big Bang Theory,59,13
35730,Raj,19, What am I supposed to do? How am I supposed to choose between Emily and Lucy?,7,Big Bang Theory,78,16
35731,Howard,19, Why do you have to choose? Date both of them.,7,Big Bang Theory,46,10
35732,Raj,19," I can't date two women at once. Zero women, that's my sweet spot.",7,Big Bang Theory,66,13
35733,Penny,19," Unless you're sleeping with one of them, seeing other people isn't a big deal.",7,Big Bang Theory,79,14
35734,Raj,19," But what if one of them asks me what I was up to the night before and I was with the other one? Then, what, do I lie?",7,Big Bang Theory,118,28
35737,Howard,19," What do you mean, yes?",7,Big Bang Theory,23,5
35739,Howard,19, No. Were you seeing other men?,7,Big Bang Theory,31,6
35741,Leonard,19, Were you seeing other men?,7,Big Bang Theory,27,5
35742,Penny,19, No.,7,Big Bang Theory,4,1
35743,Leonard,19, Aren't you gonna ask me?,7,Big Bang Theory,25,5
35744,Penny,19," Come on, really?",7,Big Bang Theory,17,3
35746,Leonard,19, Thank you so much for letting us pick your brain.,7,Big Bang Theory,50,10
35748,Penny,19," Well, I'm having an impossible time getting my career off the ground, and I got offered a role in this crappy horror movie, and I just don't know if I should take it.",7,Big Bang Theory,167,33
35750,Penny,19, I wouldn't exactly call Star Trek embarrassing.,7,Big Bang Theory,48,7
35752,Penny,19," Me, either.",7,Big Bang Theory,12,2
35753,Leonard,19," So, what do you think, is there a professional downside to doing it?",7,Big Bang Theory,69,13
35755,Penny,19," Yeah, beam me up. I love it.",7,Big Bang Theory,29,7
35757,Penny,19, That's what I'm afraid of.,7,Big Bang Theory,27,5
35759,Leonard,19, Sounds rough.,7,Big Bang Theory,14,2
35761,Leonard,19," Okay, this was helpful.",7,Big Bang Theory,24,4
35763,Raj,19, Any news on your co-worker who's in the hospital?,7,Big Bang Theory,50,9
35765,Raj,19," Oh, no.",7,Big Bang Theory,8,2
35767,Howard,19, Were you like this when I married you?,7,Big Bang Theory,39,8
35769,Leonard,19," Don't worry about it, buddy. Okay, bye. That was Wil, he's feeling a lot better. Apparently, he's 12-down in the TV Guide crossword puzzle.",7,Big Bang Theory,140,24
35770,Raj,19, Did he help you make a decision about the movie?,7,Big Bang Theory,49,10
35771,Penny,19, No. Did you figure out what you're gonna do about the two girls?,7,Big Bang Theory,65,13
35772,Raj,19," As a matter of fact, I did. I've spent so many years living in fear, saying no to new experiences, but from now on, I'm gonna say yes, yes to love, yes to adventure, yes to life. Whatever it may be, the answer's going to be yes.",7,Big Bang Theory,229,47
35773,Howard,19," He's gonna die alone, right?",7,Big Bang Theory,29,5
35774,Leonard,19, Yes.,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
35775,Penny,19, Yes.,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
35778,Amy,19," I'm proud of you, Sheldon.",7,Big Bang Theory,27,5
35779,Sheldon,19," You know, I'm proud of me, too. I've done all my research, I conducted an informal poll, and I've arrived at the rock-solid certainty I've made the right choice.",7,Big Bang Theory,162,29
35780,Amy,19," Well, that's got to be a good feeling.",7,Big Bang Theory,39,8
35781,Sheldon,19," Oh, it is. Although.",7,Big Bang Theory,21,4
35782,Amy,19," Oh, crap.",7,Big Bang Theory,10,2
35783,Sheldon,19, I had the same feeling when I made my dad buy a Betamax instead of a VHS.,7,Big Bang Theory,74,17
35784,Amy,19, You were just a little kid.,7,Big Bang Theory,28,6
35785,Sheldon,19," Yeah, a little kid who picked the wrong format to record The MacNeil/Lehrer Report. Now I also was certain that HD DVD would win out over Blu-ray.",7,Big Bang Theory,147,27
35786,Amy,19, How old were you then?,7,Big Bang Theory,23,5
35787,Sheldon,19," Old enough to know better. You know, and now that I think about it, I stood in front of a case of iPods and I bought a Zune.",7,Big Bang Theory,125,28
35788,Amy,19, What's a Zune?,7,Big Bang Theory,15,3
35789,Sheldon,19," Yeah, exactly. It's an MP3 player brought to us by the makers of Xbox.",7,Big Bang Theory,71,14
35790,Amy,19," No, what are you doing? No, no, pick that back up. You know it's good. You did the research.",7,Big Bang Theory,93,19
35791,Sheldon,19, But what if I'm wrong?,7,Big Bang Theory,23,5
35792,Amy,19, You know what? How about I buy it for you? How about I buy you both?,7,Big Bang Theory,69,16
35793,Sheldon,19, You know I only have one slot available in my entertainment centre.,7,Big Bang Theory,68,12
35794,Amy,19, Then I'll buy you a new entertainment centre.,7,Big Bang Theory,46,8
35795,Sheldon,19," Well, yeah, okay, sure. But which one?",7,Big Bang Theory,39,7
35796,Amy,19," How about this? I've heard that if you flip a coin, it will tell you how you actually feel. Because you'll either be disappointed or excited by the outcome.",7,Big Bang Theory,157,29
35797,Sheldon,19, Interesting.,7,Big Bang Theory,13,1
35798,Amy,19," So, heads it's PS4, tails it's Xbox One.",7,Big Bang Theory,41,8
35799,Sheldon,19," All right, I'll try.",7,Big Bang Theory,21,4
35800,Amy,19, What is it?,7,Big Bang Theory,12,3
35801,Sheldon,19, A quarter.,7,Big Bang Theory,11,2
35802,Amy,19, Could have given it back to me. That was a choice.,7,Big Bang Theory,51,11
35804,Raj,19," You look, you look really pretty tonight.",7,Big Bang Theory,42,7
35806,Raj,19," Thank you. Thanks, thanks. I'm sorry. I can't do this. My, my ex-girlfriend e-mailed me, and I'm seeing her Saturday, And I'm glad you like it, it's from J. Crew.",7,Big Bang Theory,163,30
35808,Raj,19," My friends told me it was okay to see more than one person at a time, but it, it feels like I'm being deceitful.",7,Big Bang Theory,113,24
35810,Raj,19," No. I, I have no idea. What would you do?",7,Big Bang Theory,42,10
35812,Raj,19," Well, to be honest, we only went on four dates, hugged twice, kissed once, and there was a handshake loaded with sexual innuendo.",7,Big Bang Theory,130,23
35814,Raj,19, Yeah.,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
35816,Raj,19," Are you, are you sure? Because this is the part of the night where I've said something stupid and the girl usually leaves.",7,Big Bang Theory,123,23
35818,Raj,19," Yeah, but now you make me wonder what's wrong with you.",7,Big Bang Theory,56,11
35820,Raj,19, Really? Because I'm dating two women is basically the only cool thing I can say about myself.,7,Big Bang Theory,94,17
35822,Sheldon,19," On the one hand, the Xbox One has a better camera, but the PS4 has a removable hard drive. Thoughts?",7,Big Bang Theory,101,20
35823,Amy,19, I can't feel my legs.,7,Big Bang Theory,22,5
35825,Sheldon,19, But I haven't decided yet.,7,Big Bang Theory,27,5
35827,Amy,19," Let's get you some food. You, You'll feel better after you eat.",7,Big Bang Theory,64,12
35828,Sheldon,19, Okay.,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
35829,Amy,19," What-what do you want, like, Thai food? A burger?",7,Big Bang Theory,50,9
35830,Sheldon,19," I don't know. Hey, look, a quarter.",7,Big Bang Theory,36,7
35833,Penny,19, Great. Not like regret at all.,7,Big Bang Theory,31,6
35836,Leonard,20," I got to tell you, the more I read about the primordial gravity wave discovery, the more excited I get.",7,Big Bang Theory,104,20
35837,Raj,20, I know. Being an astrophysicist right now is like being a rock star.,7,Big Bang Theory,69,13
35838,Howard,20, Only without the sex.,7,Big Bang Theory,22,4
35839,Raj,20," Yeah, literally, none of it.",7,Big Bang Theory,29,5
35840,Leonard,20," What do you think about it, Sheldon?",7,Big Bang Theory,37,7
35841,Sheldon,20, Meh.,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
35842,Raj,20," Are you kidding me? This may be the biggest scientific breakthrough of our lifetime. How can you, as a theoretical physicist, not care about this?",7,Big Bang Theory,147,25
35843,Sheldon,20," Maybe it's because I'm not an elitist. What I'd like to know is, how does this gravity wave breakthrough help the man on the street? You know? Who's looking out for Joe six-pack and all his quantum physics concerns?",7,Big Bang Theory,216,39
35844,Leonard,20," Oh, my God, you're jealous.",7,Big Bang Theory,28,5
35845,Sheldon,20, Why would I be jealous?,7,Big Bang Theory,24,5
35846,Leonard,20," Oh, I don't know. Maybe because the origin of the universe just got proven, the Higgs field just got proven, and you've been working on string theory for the last 20 years and you're no closer to proving it than when you started.",7,Big Bang Theory,230,43
35847,Sheldon,20," Yeah, well, I've had a lot on my plate. We happen to live in a golden age of television.",7,Big Bang Theory,89,19
35849,Sheldon,20, Really? Did they find evidence to support extra dimensions or supersymmetry?,7,Big Bang Theory,77,11
35851,Sheldon,20, Why would you do that? You're a string theorist as well.,7,Big Bang Theory,57,11
35853,Sheldon,20, Do you think he's right? Am I wasting my life on a theory that can never be proven?,7,Big Bang Theory,84,18
35854,Howard,20, Maybe. But how great is Game of Thrones?,7,Big Bang Theory,41,8
35856,Penny,20," Hey, you're up early.",7,Big Bang Theory,22,4
35857,Sheldon,20, I couldn't sleep.,7,Big Bang Theory,18,3
35858,Penny,20, I told you those Walking Dead pillowcases were a bad idea.,7,Big Bang Theory,59,11
35859,Sheldon,20," No, that's not it.",7,Big Bang Theory,19,4
35860,Penny,20, Is something bothering you?,7,Big Bang Theory,28,4
35861,Sheldon,20," Yes, but you wouldn't understand.",7,Big Bang Theory,34,5
35862,Penny,20," Oh, come on, try me.",7,Big Bang Theory,21,5
35863,Sheldon,20," All right. I've devoted the prime of my life to string theory and its quest for the compactification of extra dimensions. I've got nothing to show for it, and I feel like a fool.",7,Big Bang Theory,179,34
35864,Penny,20," Okay. I get it. I mean, not all the jibberjabber in the middle, but I know what it's like to put your heart and soul into something and get nothing out of it.",7,Big Bang Theory,159,33
35865,Sheldon,20, You mean your acting career?,7,Big Bang Theory,29,5
35866,Penny,20, No.,7,Big Bang Theory,4,1
35867,Sheldon,20, Your relationship with Leonard?,7,Big Bang Theory,32,4
35868,Penny,20, No.,7,Big Bang Theory,4,1
35869,Sheldon,20, Your failed attempt to go back to college?,7,Big Bang Theory,43,8
35870,Penny,20," No. I'm saying you and string theory sound like a relationship, and I know what it's like to be in one and realize it's never gonna turn out the way you want.",7,Big Bang Theory,159,32
35871,Sheldon,20," I said Leonard, you said no.",7,Big Bang Theory,29,6
35872,Penny,20, I'm talking about other guys.,7,Big Bang Theory,30,5
35873,Sheldon,20," Okay. Well, what do you do?",7,Big Bang Theory,28,6
35874,Penny,20," You have to have the courage to end the relationship. You know? Break it off, shake hands, walk away.",7,Big Bang Theory,102,19
35875,Sheldon,20, I don't know if I can do that.,7,Big Bang Theory,31,8
35876,Penny,20," I know it's hard, honey, but in the end, that's how you grow.",7,Big Bang Theory,62,13
35877,Leonard,20," Penny, have you seen my good inhaler?",7,Big Bang Theory,38,7
35878,Sheldon,20," Break it off, shake hands, walk away.",7,Big Bang Theory,38,7
35880,Leonard,20," Hey, how's dating two women going?",7,Big Bang Theory,35,6
35881,Raj,20," Um, kind of hit a bump. When I was honest and told Emily she wasn't the only person I was seeing, it went great. So I tried the same thing with Lucy.",7,Big Bang Theory,150,32
35882,Howard,20, And?,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
35883,Raj,20," She had mixed feelings. But when I said, Emily was cool with it. Emily's the best. Why can't you",7,Big Bang Theory,97,19
35884,Leonard,20, Women. Who knows what'll set 'em off?,7,Big Bang Theory,38,7
35885,Raj,20, At least now I can focus all my energies on just one girl.,7,Big Bang Theory,59,13
35886,Howard,20, I hope I get to meet her as soon as possible.,7,Big Bang Theory,46,11
35887,Raj,20, Why the rush? She isn't going anywhere.,7,Big Bang Theory,40,7
35888,Howard,20, She is. But I like that attitude.,7,Big Bang Theory,34,7
35889,Sheldon,20," Gentlemen, is anybody interested in my old string theory books?",7,Big Bang Theory,64,10
35890,Raj,20, You're really going to do this?,7,Big Bang Theory,32,6
35891,Sheldon,20," I am. Yeah, Penny pointed out that what I'm going through is essentially a breakup. And according to Cosmopolitan magazine, one of the most effective techniques for moving on is to get rid of all reminders of the relationship.",7,Big Bang Theory,227,39
35892,Howard,20, You're reading Cosmo?,7,Big Bang Theory,22,3
35893,Sheldon,20," Yes. As it turns out, there's an article on how to get over a breakup in literally every issue. Anyway, it suggests that I set these on fire, but the smell of burning books reminds me of church picnics in East Texas.",7,Big Bang Theory,217,42
35894,Howard,20, What's this?,7,Big Bang Theory,13,2
35895,Sheldon,20," Oh, that's just a doodle of a hyperelliptic Riemann surface.",7,Big Bang Theory,61,10
35896,Leonard,20," Oh, yeah. Wasn't that the basis of your postdoc fellowship?",7,Big Bang Theory,60,10
35897,Sheldon,20," It was. This seemed so elegant at the time, but now I realize I was just a simple country boy seduced by a big city theory with variables in all the right places.",7,Big Bang Theory,163,33
35898,Raj,20, It's going to be okay.,7,Big Bang Theory,23,5
35899,Sheldon,20," I know. As hard as this is, I have to move on. I can't keep postulating multidimensional entities and get nothing in return. I have needs, too.",7,Big Bang Theory,144,27
35900,Howard,20," So, you and Emily still together?",7,Big Bang Theory,34,6
35902,Howard,20, I spoke to Bernadette. She's free tomorrow night.,7,Big Bang Theory,50,8
35903,Raj,20," Oh, okay, great. But if we're really gonna do a double date, then we have to go over some ground rules about Emily.",7,Big Bang Theory,116,23
35904,Howard,20," Like when it turns out she's made of rubber, I don't say anything?",7,Big Bang Theory,67,13
35905,Raj,20, She's very real.,7,Big Bang Theory,17,3
35906,Howard,20," Oh, that's what it says on the box. Right next to dishwasher safe.",7,Big Bang Theory,67,13
35907,Raj,20, See? This is exactly the kind of thing I'm worried about you saying in front of her.,7,Big Bang Theory,85,17
35908,Howard,20, I promise I'll be on my best behaviour.,7,Big Bang Theory,40,8
35909,Raj,20, You better be. No jokes about how close I am with my dog. Or the truth about how close I am with my dog.,7,Big Bang Theory,105,24
35910,Howard,20, You got it.,7,Big Bang Theory,12,3
35911,Raj,20, No jokes about the year I took ballet.,7,Big Bang Theory,39,8
35912,Howard,20, You took ballet?,7,Big Bang Theory,17,3
35913,Raj,20," God, you never listen.",7,Big Bang Theory,23,4
35915,Leonard,20, Are you sure you want to do this?,7,Big Bang Theory,34,8
35916,Sheldon,20, The magazine articles suggest that one of the ways to get over a breakup is a new look.,7,Big Bang Theory,88,18
35917,Leonard,20," What about your old look, well-groomed ventriloquist doll?",7,Big Bang Theory,59,8
35918,Penny,20," Oh my God, I do look like that.",7,Big Bang Theory,32,8
35919,Sheldon,20, You stop it.,7,Big Bang Theory,13,3
35920,Penny,20," So, how do you want me to cut it?",7,Big Bang Theory,34,9
35921,Sheldon,20," Oh, how about Bill Gates meets Nikola Tesla?",7,Big Bang Theory,45,8
35922,Leonard,20," So, business in the front, science in the back.",7,Big Bang Theory,48,9
35923,Penny,20, Or I don't cut it and maybe just style it a little.,7,Big Bang Theory,52,12
35924,Sheldon,20," Oh, I'm in your hands. Do a good job and I'll tell you Cosmo's ten dynamite tips to enjoy your PMS.",7,Big Bang Theory,100,21
35925,Penny,20, Can you keep him quiet? Maybe jangle some keys in front of him?,7,Big Bang Theory,64,13
35926,Leonard,20," That doesn't work any more. He just thinks I'm taking him to the doctor. So, now that you're no longer invested in string theory, what are you gonna pursue?",7,Big Bang Theory,157,29
35927,Sheldon,20," Oh, there are so many exciting areas. Black holes, dark matter.",7,Big Bang Theory,64,11
35928,Penny,20," Oh, Leonard was telling me about dark matter, but I didn't really understand it.",7,Big Bang Theory,81,14
35929,Sheldon,20, Don't feel bad. Neither does he.,7,Big Bang Theory,33,6
35930,Penny,20," Okay, what do you think?",7,Big Bang Theory,25,5
35931,Sheldon,20, Have you ever even seen a picture of Tesla?,7,Big Bang Theory,44,9
35932,Leonard,20," It actually looks good, Sheldon.",7,Big Bang Theory,33,5
35933,Penny,20, Doesn't it?,7,Big Bang Theory,12,2
35934,Leonard,20, Yeah.,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
35935,Sheldon,20," I suppose I could see myself in a scientific boy band. Of course, I'd be the dreamy one and the smart one.",7,Big Bang Theory,107,22
35936,Amy,20, Sorry I'm late. What did you do?,7,Big Bang Theory,33,7
35937,Penny,20," I gave him a new look. It's cute, huh?",7,Big Bang Theory,39,9
35938,Amy,20," Yeah, it's cute. That's the problem. I don't need other girls to see him walking around like sex on a stick.",7,Big Bang Theory,109,21
35939,Sheldon,20, She's right. I'm too hot.,7,Big Bang Theory,26,5
35942,Howard,20," Me, too. I just hope he doesn't blow it.",7,Big Bang Theory,41,9
35944,Howard,20," Because he's Raj, that's his thing. Beckham can bend it, Ralph can wreck it, Raj can blow it. Look, I don't want it to happen, but odds are he's gonna find a way to Oh, crap, I know that girl.",7,Big Bang Theory,193,40
35946,Howard,20," In a bad way, very bad.",7,Big Bang Theory,24,6
35947,Raj,20," Hey, guys.",7,Big Bang Theory,11,2
35948,Howard,20," Whatever you hear tonight, just remember I love you. Hey.",7,Big Bang Theory,58,10
35949,Raj,20," Emily, these are my good friends, Howard and Bernadette. Guys, this is Emily.",7,Big Bang Theory,78,13
35953,Howard,20," Uh, no. I, I don't, I don't think so.",7,Big Bang Theory,38,9
35955,Howard,20," Well, you sure don't. You I know, you I know, you? Total stranger. Even if you had yummy candy, I would not get in your van.",7,Big Bang Theory,125,26
35957,Howard,20, That must be it.,7,Big Bang Theory,17,4
35958,Raj,20, Since when do you go to spin class?,7,Big Bang Theory,36,8
35959,Howard,20, Wow. Now who doesn't listen?,7,Big Bang Theory,29,5
35961,Amy,20," Sheldon, your food's getting cold. What are you doing?",7,Big Bang Theory,55,9
35962,Sheldon,20," Oh, looking through my textbooks for a new field of inquiry. Why do we have a geology book? Leonard, did you throw a children's party while I was in Texas?",7,Big Bang Theory,156,30
35963,Penny,20, Wait. What's wrong with geology?,7,Big Bang Theory,33,5
35964,Sheldon,20," Let me put this in a way you'll understand, Penny. You remember how you explained to me that the Kardashians aren't real celebrities? Well, geology is the Kardashians of science.",7,Big Bang Theory,179,30
35965,Sheldon,20, Have you considered studying standard model physics?,7,Big Bang Theory,53,7
35966,Sheldon,20," You want me to give up string theory for something that's less advanced? You know, why don't you break up with Penny and start dating a brown bear?",7,Big Bang Theory,148,28
35967,Penny,20, Like you could get a brown bear.,7,Big Bang Theory,33,7
35968,Leonard,20," Hey, I've got a good job. I could buy salmon. You don't know.",7,Big Bang Theory,62,13
35969,Amy,20, Maybe you could make your new field of study the calculation of nuclear matrix elements.,7,Big Bang Theory,89,15
35970,Sheldon,20," Oh, please. If I wanted to take up a fad, I'd get a tramp stamp.",7,Big Bang Theory,65,15
35971,Leonard,20, What about loop quantum gravity?,7,Big Bang Theory,33,5
35972,Sheldon,20," Oh, Duchess, look at me. My quantum gravity's positively loopy.",7,Big Bang Theory,64,10
35973,Penny,20, Who's the duchess?,7,Big Bang Theory,19,3
35974,Leonard,20, One of the people that lives in his head.,7,Big Bang Theory,42,9
35975,Amy,20, I hope he's this distraught if he ever breaks up with me.,7,Big Bang Theory,58,12
35976,Leonard,20," Well, if he does, I'll see if my bear has a friend.",7,Big Bang Theory,52,12
35977,Penny,20," Sheldon, have you ever considered not rushing into something new? I mean, why don't you take your time, enjoy your freedom? Maybe something new to study will find you.",7,Big Bang Theory,168,29
35978,Sheldon,20," That's actually not bad advice. You know, I didn't seek out string theory. It just hit me over the head one day.",7,Big Bang Theory,113,22
35979,Amy,20, How does that happen?,7,Big Bang Theory,22,4
35980,Sheldon,20, A bully chased me through the school library and hit me over the head with the biggest book he could find.,7,Big Bang Theory,107,21
35981,Penny,20," Okay, how about we toast your newfound freedom?",7,Big Bang Theory,48,8
35982,Sheldon,20," Ah, normally I refrain from alcohol, but since my cerebral cortex is twiddling its proverbial thumbs, why not soak it in grape juice that's been predigested by a fungus?",7,Big Bang Theory,170,29
35983,Penny,20, And you wonder why other children beat you with books. Cheers!,7,Big Bang Theory,63,11
35987,Raj,20," Mmm, and you know what that means. Someone's skin's about to be softer than ever.",7,Big Bang Theory,82,15
35989,Raj,20," Oh, uh, Howard was an astronaut. Maybe that's where you saw him.",7,Big Bang Theory,65,12
35991,Howard,20," It was the most incredible experience of my life. Up there in the space station, you're",7,Big Bang Theory,88,16
35993,Howard,20, Can I finish my astronaut story?,7,Big Bang Theory,33,6
35995,Howard,20, Please don't say it.,7,Big Bang Theory,21,4
35997,Howard,20, Please don't say it.,7,Big Bang Theory,21,4
35999,Howard,20, You're saying it.,7,Big Bang Theory,18,3
36000,Raj,20," Wh, what happened?",7,Big Bang Theory,19,3
36002,Howard,20," Okay, I'll say it. I was on the way to pick her up. My stomach felt a little funny. When I got there, I asked if I could use her bathroom.",7,Big Bang Theory,139,31
36004,Howard,20," One roll of toilet paper and 20 minutes later, I was so humiliated, I snuck out the window and never saw her again.",7,Big Bang Theory,116,23
36006,Howard,20," I'm sorry. I tried to unclog it, but you didn't have a plunger, and water was spilling out everywhere.",7,Big Bang Theory,103,19
36008,Howard,20," Look, I have felt terrible about this for years, and I'm glad I have the opportunity to tell you just how sorry I am.",7,Big Bang Theory,118,24
36010,Raj,20, Get it? Because you clogged up her bathroom like a radioactive monster!,7,Big Bang Theory,72,12
36011,Howard,20," Yeah, yeah, I get it.",7,Big Bang Theory,22,5
36013,Howard,20," Well, hey, it's not like cotton candy comes out of you.",7,Big Bang Theory,56,11
36015,Amy,20," Come on, let's get you to bed. You've had a lot to drink.",7,Big Bang Theory,58,13
36016,Sheldon,20, No more than Penny.,7,Big Bang Theory,20,4
36017,Amy,20, That's what I'm saying.,7,Big Bang Theory,24,4
36018,Sheldon,20," Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Empty room.  Empty room.  Empty room. If somebody says come in, I'm gonna freak out.",7,Big Bang Theory,116,20
36023,Raj,20," She's scary, but it's a cute scary.",7,Big Bang Theory,36,7
36024,Howard,20," Can I say just one more thing? I had some kind of food poisoning that day. Sure, in retrospect, gas station sushi, maybe not the best choice. Nor was climbing out your window and running away. But I think we can all understand how humiliating that was, and I'd really appreciate it if we could move on.",7,Big Bang Theory,303,57
36026,Howard,20, I'm just saying,7,Big Bang Theory,16,3
36028,Howard,20, Okay. Fine.,7,Big Bang Theory,12,2
36030,Howard,20," Ah, it's all right. They could've filled the bowl a little more. Excuse me.",7,Big Bang Theory,76,14
36032,Howard,20, I need some fresh air.,7,Big Bang Theory,23,5
36035,Sheldon,20," Oh, no. What have I done?",7,Big Bang Theory,26,6
36037,Leonard,20, How you feeling?,7,Big Bang Theory,17,3
36038,Sheldon,20, Not so good.,7,Big Bang Theory,13,3
36039,Leonard,20, Are you gonna introduce me to your friend?,7,Big Bang Theory,43,8
36040,Sheldon,20, It's not my friend. Nothing happened.,7,Big Bang Theory,38,6
36041,Leonard,20, I don't know. I heard you reading pretty loud last night.,7,Big Bang Theory,58,11
36042,Sheldon,20," Oh, dear Lord. Where's Amy?",7,Big Bang Theory,28,5
36043,Leonard,20," After she put you to bed, she went home.",7,Big Bang Theory,41,9
36044,Sheldon,20," Oh. I should call her and apologize. Oh, no.",7,Big Bang Theory,45,9
36045,Leonard,20, What?,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
36046,Sheldon,20," Apparently, I called Stephen Hawking last night.",7,Big Bang Theory,49,7
36049,Sheldon,20," Hawkman. It's your old buddy Sheldonoscopy. How come you didn't pick up the phone? Oh, right. My bad.",7,Big Bang Theory,102,18
36051,Howard,20, You're awful quiet. Everything okay?,7,Big Bang Theory,37,5
36052,Sheldon,20, Not really. I had a bit of an embarrassing evening.,7,Big Bang Theory,52,10
36053,Howard,20," Ugh. Me, too. What happened?",7,Big Bang Theory,29,5
36054,Sheldon,20, I drank alcohol and may have left an unfortunate voice mail for Stephen Hawking.,7,Big Bang Theory,81,14
36055,Howard,20, I wouldn't worry about it. He's got a pretty good sense of humour.,7,Big Bang Theory,67,13
36056,Sheldon,20," Oh, I hope so. What happened to you last night?",7,Big Bang Theory,48,10
36057,Howard,20," Oh, well, turns out I'd already met the girl Raj is seeing when I did a number on her bathroom. And that number was two.",7,Big Bang Theory,121,25
36058,Sheldon,20," Well, you know, I've always been a fan of a story told by Attar of Nishapur, about a king who assembled a group of wise men to create a ring that would make him happy when he was sad. And that ring was inscribed with the phrase, this too shall pass.",7,Big Bang Theory,250,51
36060,Howard,20," Get out of here, Barry.",7,Big Bang Theory,24,5
36062,Sheldon,20, Clogzilla. That's pretty funny. I don't think that's gonna pass.,7,Big Bang Theory,65,10
36065,Sheldon,20," It's me again. I gave up string theory. You should give up black holes, and we can totally solve crimes together.",7,Big Bang Theory,114,21
36067,Sheldon,20, Do you know what's great? Geology. Oh. Look at this geode. That's fun to say. Gee-ode. Gee-ode.,7,Big Bang Theory,96,17
36069,Sheldon,20, Gee-ode. Gee-ode. I kiss girls now.,7,Big Bang Theory,36,6
36071,Sheldon,20," Hey, guess who I am. Beep bop boop bop. I'm you. Get it?",7,Big Bang Theory,57,13
36073,Sheldon,20," Are you mad at me? Oh, no, you're mad at me. I'm so sorry. Beep bop boop bop.",7,Big Bang Theory,78,18
36075,Sheldon,20," Thiospinel sulfide. Thiospinel sulfide. That's even more fun than gee-ode. Hey, did you see The Lego Movie?",7,Big Bang Theory,108,17
36078,Penny,21," So, we're about to shoot this scene in the movie where the killer ape DNA is slowly taking over my body.",7,Big Bang Theory,105,21
36079,Leonard,21, Okay.,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
36080,Penny,21," But I realize they're gluing fur everywhere except my cleavage. So, I asked the director why and he says, it's important to the story that my boobs be the last things to turn ape.",7,Big Bang Theory,180,34
36081,Leonard,21, It's sweet that he thinks there's a story.,7,Big Bang Theory,43,8
36082,Penny,21," Oh, and there's not even a bathroom on set. I have to go to the gas station across the street. I mean, I was dressed like half an ape and still not even close to the most disgusting person in there.",7,Big Bang Theory,199,41
36083,Sheldon,21," Leonard, I could use your assistance.",7,Big Bang Theory,38,6
36084,Leonard,21, Sure. What's up?,7,Big Bang Theory,17,3
36085,Sheldon,21," Well, now that I've given up string theory, I'm struggling to find my next area of focus. So, in your professional opinion, which of these areas do you think is the most promising?",7,Big Bang Theory,181,33
36086,Leonard,21," Huh, well, I think there's some really innovative stuff going on in dark matter.",7,Big Bang Theory,81,14
36087,Sheldon,21, That's helpful. Okay. Of these four areas,7,Big Bang Theory,42,7
36088,Penny,21," Sheldon, what did we say about being a nicer friend?",7,Big Bang Theory,53,10
36089,Leonard,21, Thank you.,7,Big Bang Theory,11,2
36090,Penny,21," Leonard, what did we say about being a gullible weenie?",7,Big Bang Theory,56,10
36091,Sheldon,21, It is just so frustrating.,7,Big Bang Theory,27,5
36092,Penny,21," â€˜Cause you're trying too hard. You need to do something else, get your mind off it.",7,Big Bang Theory,86,16
36093,Leonard,21, Hey. How about we bring back Anything Can Happen Thursdays?,7,Big Bang Theory,60,10
36094,Penny,21," Hey, that's good. Why'd you guys stop doing that?",7,Big Bang Theory,50,9
36095,Leonard,21, You made fun of us. Said it was stupid.,7,Big Bang Theory,40,9
36096,Penny,21," Yeah. Sounds like me. Come on, Sheldon. What do you say?",7,Big Bang Theory,57,11
36097,Sheldon,21, All right. I officially reinstate Anything Can Happen Thursday.,7,Big Bang Theory,64,9
36098,Leonard,21," Great, what do you want to do?",7,Big Bang Theory,31,7
36099,Sheldon,21, I don't know. What do you want to do?,7,Big Bang Theory,38,9
36100,Penny,21, I don't know. What do you want to do?,7,Big Bang Theory,38,9
36101,Leonard,21, I'm starting to remember the problem with Anything Can Happen Thursdays.,7,Big Bang Theory,73,11
36103,Sheldon,21," Hmm, what can we do that's fun?",7,Big Bang Theory,32,7
36104,Leonard,21, What can we do that's different?,7,Big Bang Theory,33,6
36105,Penny,21, What can we do that's free?,7,Big Bang Theory,28,6
36106,Sheldon,21," Oh, got it. We order a pizza.",7,Big Bang Theory,30,7
36107,Penny,21, Are you kidding? That's what you always do. Think harder.,7,Big Bang Theory,58,10
36108,Sheldon,21," You're right. You're right. Got it. We order calzones, cut them open, eat them like pizza. All right, all right, I'll shake the brain bush one more time, see what falls out. Got it. There's a live-action role-playing group that meets every Thursday night in Griffith Park and re-enacts battles from Lord of the Rings.",7,Big Bang Theory,318,55
36109,Penny,21," Uh, tell me more about this calzone idea.",7,Big Bang Theory,42,8
36110,Leonard,21," You know what? Why don't we just ease into this. Let, let's go for a walk and, and, and see if we find a new restaurant.",7,Big Bang Theory,121,26
36111,Sheldon,21, Any chance that restaurant is near Griffith Park?,7,Big Bang Theory,50,8
36112,Leonard,21, No.,7,Big Bang Theory,4,1
36113,Sheldon,21, All right.,7,Big Bang Theory,11,2
36114,Leonard,21," Raj and Howard are at Howard's mom's, but should we call the girls and see if they want to come?",7,Big Bang Theory,97,20
36115,Penny,21, No. Bernadette's working late.,7,Big Bang Theory,31,4
36116,Sheldon,21, Amy's sick.,7,Big Bang Theory,12,2
36117,Leonard,21, Aw. What's wrong with her?,7,Big Bang Theory,27,5
36118,Sheldon,21," Well, she talks a lot. She always wants to hold hands.",7,Big Bang Theory,55,11
36119,Leonard,21, That's not what I meant.,7,Big Bang Theory,25,5
36120,Sheldon,21," Well, if you were referring to her illness your question should have been, what ails her?",7,Big Bang Theory,90,16
36121,Leonard,21, What ails her?,7,Big Bang Theory,15,3
36122,Sheldon,21, Oh. Who knows?,7,Big Bang Theory,15,3
36123,Penny,21," Come on, anything can happen. We can push him down the stairs.",7,Big Bang Theory,63,12
36125,Howard,21, Hey. Thanks for coming to hang out.,7,Big Bang Theory,36,7
36126,Raj,21, No problem. How's your mom feeling?,7,Big Bang Theory,36,6
36127,Howard,21," Okay, but she'd feel better if she took her medicine.",7,Big Bang Theory,54,10
36128,Raj,21," You know, when Cinnamon won't take her medicine, I hide it in a piece of cheese.",7,Big Bang Theory,81,16
36129,Howard,21," Good idea. We can wrap the pill in cheese, feed it to Cinnamon, and then my mom can eat Cinnamon. So what do you feel like doing?",7,Big Bang Theory,130,27
36130,Raj,21, I was thinking we could watch a DVD.,7,Big Bang Theory,37,8
36131,Howard,21," Well, my mom doesn't have a lot to choose from. Unless you want to watch the video of her colonoscopy. Spoiler alert, 20 minutes in they find a prune pit.",7,Big Bang Theory,155,30
36132,Raj,21," Actually, how do you feel about watching House of 1000 Corpses?",7,Big Bang Theory,64,11
36133,Howard,21, A straight-up gore-fest? You hate this stuff.,7,Big Bang Theory,46,7
36134,Raj,21," I do, but for some reason, Emily loves it and wants to watch it with me tomorrow, so I thought if I start with you first, then I could act cool about it with her.",7,Big Bang Theory,163,35
36135,Howard,21," That's actually not a bad plan. I can sit through the colonoscopy now, but that first time I was like, oh my God, a prune pit.",7,Big Bang Theory,127,26
36136,Raj,21," Uh, so, you'll watch it?",7,Big Bang Theory,25,5
36137,Howard,21, Sure.,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
36138,Raj,21, You're a good friend. I owe you one.,7,Big Bang Theory,37,8
36140,Raj,21, Not that one.,7,Big Bang Theory,14,3
36142,Sheldon,21," So, we're just randomly choosing a restaurant without researching it online?",7,Big Bang Theory,77,11
36143,Penny,21, Yep.,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
36144,Sheldon,21," Great. You know, this is how Anything Can Happen Thursday turns into It Won't Stop Coming Up Friday.",7,Big Bang Theory,101,18
36145,Leonard,21," Hey, how about that Asian fusion place?",7,Big Bang Theory,40,7
36146,Sheldon,21, Fusion and Asians? I'm trying not to think about science.,7,Big Bang Theory,58,10
36147,Penny,21, What the hell? What? She's not working late.,7,Big Bang Theory,45,8
36148,Sheldon,21, And Amy doesn't look sick.,7,Big Bang Theory,27,5
36149,Penny,21, Why would they lie to us?,7,Big Bang Theory,26,6
36150,Sheldon,21, That's a good question.  Amy and Bernadette.  Amy and Bernadette.  Amy and Bernadette. Why did you lie to us?,7,Big Bang Theory,110,19
36152,Raj,21," Hey. Listen to this. Murder, cannibalism and satanic rituals are just a few of the thousand plus horrors that await.",7,Big Bang Theory,117,20
36153,Howard,21," I just helped my mom out of the tub, so, I'm one slippery horror ahead of you.",7,Big Bang Theory,79,17
36154,Raj,21, You're a good son. I don't know how you do it.,7,Big Bang Theory,47,11
36155,Howard,21," Beach blankets, my friend, it's all about beach blankets.",7,Big Bang Theory,58,9
36156,Raj,21," All right, let's get this over with. Ew, it's got someone's hair on it.",7,Big Bang Theory,72,14
36157,Howard,21," Oh, yeah, you're gonna do great with this movie.",7,Big Bang Theory,49,9
36159,Penny,21, You're not working late. Why did you lie to me?,7,Big Bang Theory,48,10
36160,Sheldon,21," And Amy, you told me you were sick, but you look just as pale and tired as always.",7,Big Bang Theory,83,18
36161,Amy,21," I'm sorry, I just needed a break from hearing you obsess about what to do after string theory.",7,Big Bang Theory,95,18
36163,Amy,21, But none of that means we don't love you.,7,Big Bang Theory,42,9
36164,Penny,21, I haven't been complaining that much about the movie. Have I?,7,Big Bang Theory,62,11
36165,Leonard,21, I also love you.,7,Big Bang Theory,17,4
36166,Penny,21," Well you know what? Maybe I need a break from all of you. Come on, Sheldon.",7,Big Bang Theory,76,16
36167,Sheldon,21, Where are we going?,7,Big Bang Theory,20,4
36168,Penny,21," We're gonna have Anything Can Happen Thursday, you're gonna tell me all about your science stuff and I'm gonna complain about my movie, and we're gonna support each other because that's what friends do.",7,Big Bang Theory,203,34
36169,Sheldon,21," Okay. â€˜Cause if I had to pick now, I'd probably go with dark matter because",7,Big Bang Theory,78,15
36170,Penny,21, Shut up.,7,Big Bang Theory,9,2
36172,Penny,21, What's wrong?,7,Big Bang Theory,14,2
36173,Sheldon,21, I don't understand my food. Chinese noodles with Korean barbecue in a taco.,7,Big Bang Theory,76,13
36174,Penny,21, It's fusion.,7,Big Bang Theory,13,2
36175,Sheldon,21, My mother would lock her car doors if she had to drive through this hodgepodge of ethnicity.,7,Big Bang Theory,93,17
36176,Penny,21, Think I've been complaining too much about the movie?,7,Big Bang Theory,54,9
36177,Sheldon,21, Not at all.,7,Big Bang Theory,12,3
36178,Penny,21, Thank you.,7,Big Bang Theory,11,2
36179,Sheldon,21," But to be fair, when you talk, most of what you say sounds like, wah, wah, wah, clothes, wah, wah, wah.",7,Big Bang Theory,104,21
36180,Penny,21," Hey, I don't understand why you're not upset with Amy.",7,Big Bang Theory,55,10
36181,Sheldon,21, I am. So much so that I'm gonna bring her here for dinner on our next date night.,7,Big Bang Theory,82,18
36183,Raj,21," Okay. So, in the last 20 minutes, we've seen a crazy woman kissing a fetus in a jar. We've seen a guy cut in half and sewn to a fish.",7,Big Bang Theory,134,30
36184,Howard,21, And the brutal dismemberment of a rotisserie chicken by my mother.,7,Big Bang Theory,67,11
36185,Raj,21," On the bright side, she didn't even notice the pill. Why does Emily like this stuff? Do you think there's something psychologically wrong with her?",7,Big Bang Theory,148,25
36186,Howard,21, What difference does it make?,7,Big Bang Theory,30,5
36187,Raj,21, What do you mean?,7,Big Bang Theory,18,4
36188,Howard,21," Oh, come on, she could have a freezer full of ex-boyfriend's body parts and you'd still go out with her.",7,Big Bang Theory,105,20
36189,Raj,21, I do like that the ex-boyfriend's out of the picture.,7,Big Bang Theory,54,10
36191,Amy,21, I feel so bad about lying to Sheldon. How am I gonna make it up to him?,7,Big Bang Theory,72,17
36193,Leonard,21, He'd probably give you homework.,7,Big Bang Theory,33,5
36194,Amy,21, Did you lie to Howard about tonight?,7,Big Bang Theory,37,7
36196,Amy,21, And you don't feel guilty about it?,7,Big Bang Theory,36,7
36198,Leonard,21, Thankfully Penny and I have a relationship based on honesty. What? I don't lie to her.,7,Big Bang Theory,87,16
36201,Penny,21," Thank you. Hey, maybe the answer to your career question is in one of these.",7,Big Bang Theory,77,15
36202,Sheldon,21," Penny, there's only one cookie with something in the middle that solves life's problems, and that's an Oreo. Or a Nutter Butter, if you're in a pinch.",7,Big Bang Theory,151,27
36203,Penny,21," Come on, open it. I bet it says something great.",7,Big Bang Theory,49,10
36204,Sheldon,21," This is Asian fusion. For all you know, there's a tiny Chihuahua in here.",7,Big Bang Theory,74,14
36205,Penny,21," Fine, I'll go. Hmm. People turn to you for guidance and wisdom. Yeah, that's a good one.",7,Big Bang Theory,89,17
36206,Sheldon,21," No, it's not.",7,Big Bang Theory,14,3
36207,Penny,21, How is that not good?,7,Big Bang Theory,22,5
36208,Sheldon,21," Turn to you for wisdom? Clearly, that cookie is mocking you. You'd never hear that kind of sass from a Nutter Butter.",7,Big Bang Theory,118,22
36209,Penny,21," Uh, since you're paying for dinner, I'll let that slide. Open yours.",7,Big Bang Theory,69,12
36210,Sheldon,21, Have you ever paid for a meal?,7,Big Bang Theory,31,7
36211,Penny,21, Not with money. Read.,7,Big Bang Theory,22,4
36212,Sheldon,21, Your warm and fun-loving nature delights those around you.,7,Big Bang Theory,59,9
36213,Penny,21," Oh, try again.",7,Big Bang Theory,15,3
36215,Howard,21," Let me get this straight. So, he kills this girl's father, cuts off the guy's face, and is wearing it as a mask while he makes out with her.",7,Big Bang Theory,141,29
36216,Raj,21, I'm just gonna say it. That's not okay. Why can't I be in a relationship with a girl who likes The Sound of Music?,7,Big Bang Theory,115,24
36217,Howard,21," Raj, you are the girl in the relationship who likes The Sound of Music.  Hey, Penny. What's up? No, Bernie's working late. Really? Thanks for telling me.",7,Big Bang Theory,154,27
36218,Raj,21, What?,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
36219,Howard,21, I'm having sex with a Catholic schoolgirl tonight.,7,Big Bang Theory,51,8
36221,Penny,21," Oh, I think I see our next stop.",7,Big Bang Theory,33,8
36222,Sheldon,21," You can't be serious. If I wanted to waste my time on nonsense, I'd follow Leonard on Instagram.",7,Big Bang Theory,97,18
36223,Penny,21," No, come on, tonight we are trying new things.",7,Big Bang Theory,47,9
36224,Sheldon,21, Oh. That's a lot of incense. Or someone set a hippie on fire.,7,Big Bang Theory,62,13
36227,Leonard,21, You and I never just hang out like this. Why is that?,7,Big Bang Theory,54,12
36228,Amy,21," I know, it's weird, right?",7,Big Bang Theory,27,5
36229,Leonard,21, Yeah. We should do it more often.,7,Big Bang Theory,34,7
36230,Amy,21," Oh, no. I mean, this is weird right now.",7,Big Bang Theory,41,9
36231,Leonard,21,"  Ah, it's Penny.",7,Big Bang Theory,17,3
36232,Amy,21, Is she still mad?,7,Big Bang Theory,18,4
36233,Leonard,21," Oh, doesn't seem like it. She got Sheldon to go to a psychic with her.",7,Big Bang Theory,71,15
36234,Amy,21," A psychic? He considers them not just mumbo jumbo, but extra-jumbo mumbo jumbo.",7,Big Bang Theory,80,13
36235,Leonard,21," Well, Penny can be very persuasive. She's gotten me to do a lot of things I wouldn't normally do.",7,Big Bang Theory,98,19
36236,Amy,21, Because she has sex with you.,7,Big Bang Theory,30,6
36237,Leonard,21," Yeah, she does.",7,Big Bang Theory,16,3
36238,Amy,21," Can I confess something? Once in a while, I get a little jealous of how close Penny and Sheldon are.",7,Big Bang Theory,101,20
36239,Leonard,21, Really?,7,Big Bang Theory,8,1
36240,Amy,21," I mean, not in a romantic way. It's just, she really has some sort of connection with him.",7,Big Bang Theory,91,18
36241,Leonard,21," Well, well they've known each other a long time, and Penny grew up around horses, so she knows how to approach him without making him skittish.",7,Big Bang Theory,144,26
36242,Amy,21," Don't get me wrong, I'm glad they're friends. I just wish he'd be that comfortable around me already.",7,Big Bang Theory,102,18
36243,Leonard,21," Well, it took him a long time to get comfortable around me, too.",7,Big Bang Theory,65,13
36244,Amy,21, Really? What did you do?,7,Big Bang Theory,25,5
36245,Leonard,21, Something terrible in a former life? I don't know.,7,Big Bang Theory,51,9
36248,Sheldon,21," I don't mean to be rude or discourteous, but before we begin, I'd just like to say there is absolutely no scientific evidence to support clairvoyance of any kind. Which means, and again, no insult intended, that you're a fraud, your profession is a swindle, and, uh, your livelihood is dependent on the gullibility of stupid people. Again, no offence.",7,Big Bang Theory,352,60
36249,Penny,21," All right, Sheldon, just ask your question.",7,Big Bang Theory,44,7
36250,Sheldon,21," Okay, I just did. What was it?",7,Big Bang Theory,31,7
36251,Penny,21," Oh, for God's sake. Look, he's a physicist who's trying to figure out what his next field of study should be.",7,Big Bang Theory,110,21
36252,Sheldon,21," For your information, I was asking her about the next Star Trek movie.",7,Big Bang Theory,71,13
36253,Penny,21," Okay, I can answer that one, I'll be bored.",7,Big Bang Theory,44,9
36255,Sheldon,21, That's an easy guess. I'm clearly an annoying person and have problems with both genders.,7,Big Bang Theory,90,15
36257,Penny,21," Oh, oh, here we go.",7,Big Bang Theory,20,5
36259,Penny,21," Yes, yes, your spirit guides are on fire.",7,Big Bang Theory,42,8
36260,Sheldon,21," The majority of people have dark hair. Even you, at one time.",7,Big Bang Theory,62,12
36262,Sheldon,21," Ha. The opposite. She's a neurobiologist, and I'm a theoretical physicist. My spirit guides can go suck an egg.",7,Big Bang Theory,112,19
36264,Penny,21," Oh, he does. He so does. What should he do?",7,Big Bang Theory,44,10
36266,Penny,21," Sheldon, do you hear that? I mean, Amy is the key to your happiness.",7,Big Bang Theory,69,14
36268,Sheldon,21," You know what this is? Yeah, and I reserve this word for those rare instances when it's truly deserved. This is malarkey.",7,Big Bang Theory,122,22
36269,Penny,21," Wow, you really struck a nerve. I've never heard him use the M word before.",7,Big Bang Theory,76,15
36271,Raj,21," Here we go, House of a 1,000 Corpses.",7,Big Bang Theory,38,8
36273,Raj,21," Actually, I have to tell you something. These kind of movies really aren't my thing, so, last night, I watched it just to see what I was getting myself into.",7,Big Bang Theory,158,30
36275,Raj,21," And I have to be honest, I thought it was disturbing and weird, and it made me wonder what it says about someone who enjoys it.",7,Big Bang Theory,128,26
36277,Raj,21," Then, why do you watch these things?",7,Big Bang Theory,37,7
36279,Raj,21, Sure.,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
36281,Raj,21, And play.,7,Big Bang Theory,10,2
36283,Sheldon,21, Hello. I didn't expect you this evening.,7,Big Bang Theory,41,7
36284,Amy,21," Well, I was just feeling so bad about lying to you the other night, I wanted to make it up to you.",7,Big Bang Theory,99,22
36285,Sheldon,21," And how do you propose to do that?  Unless you have Gravity on Blu-ray under that skirt, I don't know where you're going with this.",7,Big Bang Theory,132,25
36287,Sheldon,22," Gentlemen, Star Wars Day is rapidly approaching. We should finalize our plans.",7,Big Bang Theory,79,12
36288,Penny,22," What? That's a real thing? What is it, Star Wars Christmas?",7,Big Bang Theory,60,11
36289,Howard,22, No. Don't be ridiculous. That's Wookiee Life Day.,7,Big Bang Theory,50,8
36290,Penny,22," So, when is it?",7,Big Bang Theory,16,4
36291,Leonard,22," Uh, well, it's not May the fifth, and it's not May the third. It's May the fourth.",7,Big Bang Theory,83,17
36292,Sheldon,22, Get it?,7,Big Bang Theory,8,2
36293,Raj,22, May the fourth be with you?,7,Big Bang Theory,28,6
36294,Leonard,22, May the force be with you. Get it?,7,Big Bang Theory,35,8
36295,Penny,22," Oh, no. This face wasn't because I didn't get it.",7,Big Bang Theory,50,10
36297,Sheldon,22, Come in.,7,Big Bang Theory,9,2
36298,Leonard,22," Hey, you got a second?",7,Big Bang Theory,23,5
36299,Sheldon,22," Yes. Actually, I'm glad you're here. I'm working on the Star Wars Day schedule. Now, I have a window built in after Phantom Menace for complaining, but I'm worried an hour won't be enough time.",7,Big Bang Theory,194,35
36300,Leonard,22," Sheldon, I've got some bad news.",7,Big Bang Theory,33,6
36301,Sheldon,22, What is it?,7,Big Bang Theory,12,3
36302,Leonard,22, I just read online that Arthur Jeffries passed away.,7,Big Bang Theory,53,9
36303,Sheldon,22, Professor Proton is dead?,7,Big Bang Theory,26,4
36304,Leonard,22," Sorry, buddy.",7,Big Bang Theory,14,2
36305,Sheldon,22, What are you doing?,7,Big Bang Theory,20,4
36306,Leonard,22, Comforting you?,7,Big Bang Theory,16,2
36307,Sheldon,22," Your heart might be in the right place, but your head, chest and arms certainly aren't.",7,Big Bang Theory,88,16
36308,Leonard,22," Anyway, the, the funeral's on Sunday.",7,Big Bang Theory,38,6
36309,Sheldon,22," But, that's Star Wars Day.",7,Big Bang Theory,27,5
36310,Leonard,22," Yeah, um, of all the things about this that are sad, that might not be number one. You okay? I know he meant a lot to you.",7,Big Bang Theory,123,27
36311,Sheldon,22, I'm fine.,7,Big Bang Theory,10,2
36312,Leonard,22, Okay. Yet he cried when they changed the Raisin Bran box.,7,Big Bang Theory,58,11
36315,Amy,22, Watching your old friend?,7,Big Bang Theory,26,4
36316,Sheldon,22," Hmm. Yes. Look at him, Amy. It's such a shame. Struck down in the prime of my life.",7,Big Bang Theory,84,18
36317,Amy,22, Do you want me to go to the funeral with you?,7,Big Bang Theory,46,11
36318,Sheldon,22," Oh, I'm not going to the funeral.",7,Big Bang Theory,34,7
36319,Amy,22, Why not?,7,Big Bang Theory,9,2
36320,Sheldon,22," All those people blowing their noses. You can't tell the sick from the sad. Mm. I'll be at home celebrating Star Wars Day, as planned.",7,Big Bang Theory,135,25
36321,Amy,22, Are you sure you don't want to go say good-bye?,7,Big Bang Theory,48,10
36322,Sheldon,22," Amy, mourning the inevitable is a complete waste of time.",7,Big Bang Theory,58,10
36323,Amy,22, And watching a bunch of goofy space movies you've seen hundreds of times isn't?,7,Big Bang Theory,80,14
36324,Sheldon,22," If we were in a physical relationship, you just lost sex tonight.",7,Big Bang Theory,66,12
36326,Penny,22," Hey, guys.",7,Big Bang Theory,11,2
36327,Raj,22," Hey, Penny. Happy Star Wars Day.",7,Big Bang Theory,33,6
36328,Penny,22, Okay.,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
36329,Raj,22, Can I make you breakfast? Admiral Ackbar's Snack Bar is open for business.,7,Big Bang Theory,75,13
36330,Penny,22," No, thanks. Leonard and I are just going to the funeral.",7,Big Bang Theory,57,11
36331,Howard,22, You sure. Not even coffee? We have R2-Decaf. Maybe a nice Cafe Au Leia?,7,Big Bang Theory,72,14
36332,Raj,22, And if you're not in the mood for coffee I can always make you a Chai Tea-3PO.,7,Big Bang Theory,79,17
36333,Penny,22," Oh, I get it, like C3PO. What happened to me?",7,Big Bang Theory,46,10
36334,Raj,22," Hey, uh, Sheldon, you want anything?",7,Big Bang Theory,37,6
36335,Sheldon,22," Uh, no, thank you.",7,Big Bang Theory,19,4
36336,Howard,22, You're being so quiet. Are you upset or are you just rebooting?,7,Big Bang Theory,64,12
36337,Sheldon,22, I'm fine.,7,Big Bang Theory,10,2
36338,Penny,22," Sweetie, are you sure you don't want to come with us to the funeral?",7,Big Bang Theory,69,14
36339,Sheldon,22," Oh, I appreciate the offer, but Arthur is gone and there's nothing I can do about it. When Darth Vader struck down Obi-Wan, did Luke cry like a baby and go to his funeral?",7,Big Bang Theory,172,34
36340,Penny,22," No, he blew up the Death Star. Why do I know this?",7,Big Bang Theory,51,12
36341,Sheldon,22," Arthur Jeffries was a scientist. I'm sure he didn't care about silly superstitions like funerals. You know, if he were here, I think he'd say enjoy Star Wars Day.",7,Big Bang Theory,163,29
36342,Leonard,22," He was 84, he'd say where's my pudding?",7,Big Bang Theory,40,8
36343,Raj,22," Before you go, at least let me pack you some Attack of the Scones for the road.",7,Big Bang Theory,80,17
36344,Penny,22," Oh, like Attack of the Clones. We are leaving right now.",7,Big Bang Theory,57,11
36346,Amy,22, Arthur passing away was harder on Sheldon than he's ready to admit. Really hoping this will cheer him up.,7,Big Bang Theory,106,19
36348,Amy,22," No, it combines two of Sheldon's favorite things, chocolate chips and the ability to destroy a planet at the push of a button.",7,Big Bang Theory,127,23
36350,Amy,22," Okay, let's get the fondant and start decorating.",7,Big Bang Theory,50,8
36352,Amy,22, I wonder why that is.,7,Big Bang Theory,22,5
36354,Penny,22, I have a confession to make.,7,Big Bang Theory,29,6
36355,Leonard,22, Hmm?,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
36356,Penny,22, I've never been to a funeral before.,7,Big Bang Theory,37,7
36357,Leonard,22, Really?,7,Big Bang Theory,8,1
36358,Penny,22," I just never knew anyone that died. I had a pet pig when I was a kid. I mean, when he died, we didn't have a funeral, we had a barbecue.",7,Big Bang Theory,137,31
36359,Leonard,22," Yeah, we won't be eating Arthur tonight.",7,Big Bang Theory,41,7
36360,Penny,22," I didn't know him very well, but I still really liked him. It's weird that he's just gone.",7,Big Bang Theory,91,18
36361,Leonard,22, I know.,7,Big Bang Theory,8,2
36362,Penny,22, I feel like I want to cry.,7,Big Bang Theory,27,7
36363,Leonard,22," Oh that's, that's fine. Go ahead.",7,Big Bang Theory,34,6
36364,Penny,22, I can't do it with you staring at me.,7,Big Bang Theory,38,9
36365,Leonard,22, Sorry.,7,Big Bang Theory,7,1
36366,Penny,22," No, I'm dry. You're a big crybaby, you start, I'll join in.",7,Big Bang Theory,60,12
36367,Leonard,22, I am not a crybaby.,7,Big Bang Theory,20,5
36368,Penny,22, Toy Story 3?,7,Big Bang Theory,13,3
36369,Leonard,22," The toys were holding hands in a furnace. Look, Arthur lived a full life. And he inspired a lot of people. Sure, he, he was my childhood hero, but the fact that I got to work with him, side by side, before he died was, it was, it was a gift.",7,Big Bang Theory,242,51
36370,Penny,22, It was a gift. Thank you for being the emotional one in this relationship.,7,Big Bang Theory,75,14
36371,Leonard,22, I got your back.,7,Big Bang Theory,17,4
36372,Penny,22, Yeah.,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
36374,Raj,22," Ugh, let's get this over with.",7,Big Bang Theory,31,6
36375,Howard,22," Since we all agree Episode I isn't our favourite, maybe we just skip it this time.",7,Big Bang Theory,83,16
36376,Sheldon,22," Howard, I think you of all people should avoid espousing the principle that if something is not our favourite we should just get rid of it.",7,Big Bang Theory,140,26
36377,Raj,22," You know, I heard of this way of watching the movies called the Machete Order, where you watch Episodes IV and V, then skip Episode I, watch II and III as a flashback, and then finish with VI.",7,Big Bang Theory,193,38
36378,Howard,22," Okay, so you'd lose most of Jar Jar, all the trade route talk and the boring senate hearings, which are like watching C-SPAN with monsters.",7,Big Bang Theory,140,25
36379,Sheldon,22, Get rid of the trade route part? Then how would Palpatine get Chancellor Valorum kicked out of office? How would he get himself elected? How? Can we get through one holiday without you saying something ridiculous?,7,Big Bang Theory,214,36
36380,Raj,22, It was just a suggestion.,7,Big Bang Theory,26,5
36381,Sheldon,22," Well, you know what else was just a suggestion? Why don't we change the Raisin Bran box? Hmm? And you know who got hurt by that? Every single person who eats breakfast.",7,Big Bang Theory,169,32
36382,Raj,22, Wow.,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
36383,Howard,22, I think he's taking this Professor Proton thing pretty hard.,7,Big Bang Theory,61,10
36384,Raj,22, Should we try to console him?,7,Big Bang Theory,30,6
36385,Howard,22, Or should we respect his privacy in this moment of grief?,7,Big Bang Theory,58,11
36386,Raj,22, By staying here and watching the movie.,7,Big Bang Theory,40,7
36387,Howard,22, That's what good friends would do.,7,Big Bang Theory,35,6
36389,Howard,22," Well, at least without Sheldon here, we got to start with Episode IV.",7,Big Bang Theory,70,13
36390,Raj,22," Mm, true. I do feel guilty about him.",7,Big Bang Theory,38,8
36391,Howard,22," Me, too.",7,Big Bang Theory,9,2
36392,Raj,22, Maybe we should see how he's doing.,7,Big Bang Theory,36,7
36393,Howard,22, Yeah.,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
36394,Raj,22, But after the cantina scene.,7,Big Bang Theory,29,5
36395,Howard,22, Obviously.,7,Big Bang Theory,11,1
36397,Sheldon,22," Look at Arthur, cracking up at a joke I told him. I'll never hear that laugh again.",7,Big Bang Theory,84,17
36399,Sheldon,22, Arthur. I thought you were dead.,7,Big Bang Theory,33,6
36401,Sheldon,22, Why are you here?,7,Big Bang Theory,18,4
36403,Sheldon,22, I know why. You've come to me because you're my Obi-Wan.,7,Big Bang Theory,57,11
36405,Sheldon,22," Wow. Uh, you're dead, so I'm going to let that slide. Obi-Wan Kenobi is a character from Star Wars. After his physical demise, he comes to Luke Skywalker as his mentor in spirit form.",7,Big Bang Theory,184,34
36407,Sheldon,22, You must be here to give me advice.,7,Big Bang Theory,36,8
36409,Sheldon,22, Those are your Jedi robes.,7,Big Bang Theory,27,5
36411,Sheldon,22, Be careful with that.,7,Big Bang Theory,22,4
36414,Leonard,22," So, what did you think of your first funeral?",7,Big Bang Theory,46,9
36415,Penny,22," Well, I don't want to be a jerk, but it was kind of a bummer.",7,Big Bang Theory,62,15
36416,Leonard,22," Yeah, well, when I die, you can rent a bounce house.",7,Big Bang Theory,53,11
36417,Penny,22, You think about dying?,7,Big Bang Theory,23,4
36418,Leonard,22," Mm. Well, I think more about if I'd have any regrets.",7,Big Bang Theory,54,11
36419,Penny,22, What would you regret?,7,Big Bang Theory,23,4
36420,Leonard,22," Mm, you know, that I didn't travel more, take more risks, learn another language.",7,Big Bang Theory,82,14
36421,Penny,22, You know Klingon.,7,Big Bang Theory,18,3
36422,Leonard,22, That's true.,7,Big Bang Theory,13,2
36423,Penny,22," No, I meant that as a regret.",7,Big Bang Theory,30,7
36424,Leonard,22, I just thought of one more.,7,Big Bang Theory,28,6
36425,Penny,22, What's that?,7,Big Bang Theory,13,2
36426,Leonard,22, I regret not saying yes when you asked me to marry you.,7,Big Bang Theory,56,12
36427,Penny,22," Well, it just wasn't the right time.",7,Big Bang Theory,37,7
36428,Leonard,22, Yeah.,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
36429,Penny,22, And this is also not the right time. Do not propose.,7,Big Bang Theory,53,11
36430,Leonard,22, What?,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
36431,Penny,22, I know that face. That's your propose face.,7,Big Bang Theory,44,8
36432,Leonard,22, I was not gonna propose. It's already two to one.,7,Big Bang Theory,50,10
36433,Penny,22, What's two to one?,7,Big Bang Theory,19,4
36434,Leonard,22," I proposed twice, you proposed once. Two to one.",7,Big Bang Theory,49,9
36435,Penny,22," Oh, my. It's not a contest.",7,Big Bang Theory,28,6
36436,Leonard,22, I don't know what you're upset about. I'm the one who's losing.,7,Big Bang Theory,64,12
36437,Penny,22, Okay. Fine. Would you feel better if I propose so you could turn me down again?,7,Big Bang Theory,80,16
36438,Leonard,22," Yeah, I think I would.",7,Big Bang Theory,23,5
36439,Penny,22," Okay. Leonard, will you marry me?",7,Big Bang Theory,34,6
36440,Leonard,22, Hmm.,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
36441,Penny,22," No, don't you dare. You reject me right now and tie things up.",7,Big Bang Theory,63,13
36442,Leonard,22, It's just such a big decision. I don't want to have any regrets.,7,Big Bang Theory,65,13
36444,Amy,22, Did you ever watch Professor Proton when you were a kid?,7,Big Bang Theory,57,11
36446,Amy,22," I never watched him, either, but he seems to be the reason that Sheldon got interested in science.",7,Big Bang Theory,99,18
36448,Amy,22, That's cute.,7,Big Bang Theory,13,2
36450,Amy,22," Oh, I guess it must have been back when I was in the Girl Sprouts.",7,Big Bang Theory,67,15
36452,Amy,22, My mom made it up as an alternative to the Girl Scouts. She didn't want me selling cookies on some street corner like a whore.,7,Big Bang Theory,127,25
36454,Amy,22," Oh, I went to the library and took out a book on biology to see what whores did.",7,Big Bang Theory,81,18
36456,Leonard,22," On the one hand, if I say yes",7,Big Bang Theory,30,8
36457,Penny,22, This isn't funny anymore. Just say no so we're done with this. Will you marry me or not?,7,Big Bang Theory,89,18
36458,Leonard,22," Ooh, interesting. Did you just propose to me again?",7,Big Bang Theory,52,9
36459,Penny,22, No.,7,Big Bang Theory,4,1
36460,Leonard,22," Really? Because I just heard will you marry me? That's two proposals, one day. Sounds like someone wants to spend the rest of her life telling people how to spell the name Hofstadter.",7,Big Bang Theory,184,33
36461,Penny,22, You know what? Fine. Do whatever you want.,7,Big Bang Theory,43,8
36462,Leonard,22," Hey. Penny, don't get upset. Here. I love you, but, no, I will not marry you.",7,Big Bang Theory,78,16
36463,Penny,22, Thank you.,7,Big Bang Theory,11,2
36464,Leonard,22," Now, about that second proposal. On the one hand",7,Big Bang Theory,49,9
36467,Sheldon,22, This is the swampland of Dagobah. It's where Luke was trained in the ways of the Jedi.,7,Big Bang Theory,87,17
36469,Sheldon,22," When Obi-Wan came to Luke on this very spot, he gave him all sorts of helpful advice. So, um, what do you got for me?",7,Big Bang Theory,118,25
36471,Sheldon,22, That's it? I thought there'd be more of a reason why you're here.,7,Big Bang Theory,66,13
36473,Sheldon,22, I suppose it has something to do with your recent passing.,7,Big Bang Theory,59,11
36475,Sheldon,22," Oh, no. No. I've already had to say good-bye to 11 Dr. Whos.",7,Big Bang Theory,61,13
36477,Sheldon,22," Of course, my grandfather died when I was five. My father died when I was 14.",7,Big Bang Theory,78,16
36479,Sheldon,22," And now you're gone, too. It's like all the men I've looked up to have gone away.",7,Big Bang Theory,82,17
36481,Sheldon,22, But I do appreciate them.,7,Big Bang Theory,26,5
36483,Leonard,22," Hey, buddy. Heard you're having a rough day. You all right?",7,Big Bang Theory,60,11
36484,Sheldon,22, I'm okay. How was the funeral?,7,Big Bang Theory,31,6
36485,Leonard,22," It was nice, you know. A lot of people showed up, told some great stories about him. Did you know that Arthur's son is a high school sci?  Hey, the guys are about to start Jedi. You want to go watch?",7,Big Bang Theory,200,41
36486,Sheldon,22, I do. After I make them go back and watch one through five first.,7,Big Bang Theory,66,14
36487,Leonard,22," Sheldon, that, that'll take us all night.",7,Big Bang Theory,42,7
36488,Sheldon,22," That's true. Oh, it's a good thing I had a nap.",7,Big Bang Theory,48,11
36490,Howard,22," Boy, some of the physical comedy with Jar Jar is a little tough to watch.",7,Big Bang Theory,74,15
36491,Leonard,22, At least they toned him down in the second one.,7,Big Bang Theory,48,10
36492,Penny,22," Yeah, he is pretty stupid.",7,Big Bang Theory,27,5
36493,Raj,22," Hey, we can say it. You can't.",7,Big Bang Theory,31,7
36494,Amy,22," Hey, guys.",7,Big Bang Theory,11,2
36496,Sheldon,22, Wow. A Death Star cake.,7,Big Bang Theory,24,5
36497,Amy,22, Yeah. We were hoping it might cheer you up.,7,Big Bang Theory,44,9
36499,Howard,22," Well, you didn't miss anything. We just started over.",7,Big Bang Theory,54,9
36502,Sheldon,22, You're back.,7,Big Bang Theory,13,2
36504,Sheldon,22, That's nice.,7,Big Bang Theory,13,2
36506,Sheldon,22, Why do I need you now?,7,Big Bang Theory,23,6
36508,Sheldon,22, So?,7,Big Bang Theory,4,1
36510,Sheldon,22, Not at all.,7,Big Bang Theory,12,3
36514,Howard,23," Thanks for lifting my spirits. Next time, try lifting the box.",7,Big Bang Theory,63,11
36515,Raj,23, Please hurry.,7,Big Bang Theory,14,2
36517,Howard,23, The doctor says you need to get exercise.,7,Big Bang Theory,42,8
36519,Howard,23, Crushing my will to live isn't exercise.,7,Big Bang Theory,41,7
36520,Raj,23," If she isn't gonna use it, then why are we doing this?",7,Big Bang Theory,55,12
36521,Howard,23, She'll use it. All I need is to rig it with a fishing pole and a HoneyBaked Ham.,7,Big Bang Theory,81,18
36522,Raj,23, All right. Now what?,7,Big Bang Theory,21,4
36524,Raj,23, Do you know how to set it up?,7,Big Bang Theory,30,8
36525,Howard,23," Please, I'm an MIT-trained engineer. I think I can handle Ma, look out.",7,Big Bang Theory,72,13
36528,Raj,23, So she's gonna be laid up for at least six weeks.,7,Big Bang Theory,50,11
36529,Leonard,23, Poor Mrs. Wolowitz.,7,Big Bang Theory,20,3
36530,Amy,23, Should we do something for her?,7,Big Bang Theory,32,6
36531,Sheldon,23, I know. Let's go see the new Spider-Man movie.,7,Big Bang Theory,47,9
36532,Amy,23," Sheldon, we're talking about your friend's mother. She got hurt.",7,Big Bang Theory,65,10
36533,Sheldon,23," I thought that subject had run its course, so I changed it. It's called reading the room, Amy.",7,Big Bang Theory,95,18
36534,Penny,23, Hi.,7,Big Bang Theory,4,1
36535,Leonard,23," Hey, how were things on the set?",7,Big Bang Theory,33,7
36536,Penny,23," Uh, pretty good, actually.",7,Big Bang Theory,27,4
36537,Raj,23, So the movie's not as bad as you thought?,7,Big Bang Theory,42,9
36538,Penny,23," Oh, no, it is, but I decided instead of complaining about it, I'm just gonna go in every day and give it my all.",7,Big Bang Theory,113,24
36539,Amy,23, Good for you.,7,Big Bang Theory,14,3
36540,Penny,23, Thanks. There's no reason why I shouldn't be the best bisexual go-go dancer slowly transforming into a killer gorilla anyone's ever seen.,7,Big Bang Theory,138,22
36541,Leonard,23, I don't know. The bisexual gorilla go-go dancer in Schindler's List is tough to beat.,7,Big Bang Theory,86,15
36542,Sheldon,23," Ah, very good. Because a gorilla go-go dancer of any sexual preference would be out of place in a film about the Holocaust.",7,Big Bang Theory,124,23
36543,Leonard,23," It only gets funnier when you explain it, Sheldon.",7,Big Bang Theory,51,9
36544,Sheldon,23, I know.,7,Big Bang Theory,8,2
36546,Howard,23," Okay, she's all settled in the guest room.",7,Big Bang Theory,43,8
36548,Howard,23, You mean a forklift?,7,Big Bang Theory,21,4
36550,Howard,23, I'm sorry. I just can't deal with this right now.,7,Big Bang Theory,50,10
36552,Howard,23," Bernie, she's gonna be off her feet for six to eight weeks. Are you prepared to feed her, wash her and take her to the toilet?",7,Big Bang Theory,127,26
36554,Howard,23," Yeah, of course you would, you're a loving person. I'm what my people would call a putz.",7,Big Bang Theory,89,17
36556,Howard,23, We get a nurse. Preferably someone from a third world country who's used to suffering and unpleasant smells.,7,Big Bang Theory,109,18
36558,Howard,23, Not if we pay them well and let them listen to the music of their homeland.,7,Big Bang Theory,76,16
36560,Howard,23, Sounds like a job for a loving person. Would you like me to play some Polish music while you carry her to the toilet?,7,Big Bang Theory,118,24
36562,Howard,23, As advertised.,7,Big Bang Theory,15,2
36564,Sheldon,23, Thanks for coming with me.,7,Big Bang Theory,27,5
36565,Raj,23, Thanks for inviting me after everyone else said no. Aren't you gonna get 3-D glasses?,7,Big Bang Theory,86,15
36566,Sheldon,23, I brought my own. No sense in risking bridge-of-nose herpes.,7,Big Bang Theory,61,10
36567,Raj,23, Is that a real thing?,7,Big Bang Theory,22,5
36568,Sheldon,23," Well, until they invent nose condoms, I'm not finding out.",7,Big Bang Theory,59,10
36569,Raj,23," Emily, Hey.",7,Big Bang Theory,12,2
36571,Raj,23," Uh, this is my friend, Sheldon. Sheldon, this is Emily.",7,Big Bang Theory,56,10
36572,Sheldon,23," Oh, yes, you're the dermatologist. I went for a walk yesterday without sunscreen. Do you see anything on my forehead that I should be concerned about?",7,Big Bang Theory,151,26
36574,Raj,23, Are you here alone?,7,Big Bang Theory,20,4
36576,Raj,23," What do you mean, not really?",7,Big Bang Theory,30,6
36579,Raj,23," Yeah, okay.",7,Big Bang Theory,12,2
36580,Sheldon,23," That was awkward, right?",7,Big Bang Theory,25,4
36581,Raj,23, Uh-huh.,7,Big Bang Theory,8,1
36582,Sheldon,23, Is it because she's dating you but was out with that other fellow?,7,Big Bang Theory,67,13
36583,Raj,23, Yes.,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
36584,Sheldon,23, Good. I thought she saw something on my forehead.,7,Big Bang Theory,50,9
36588,Penny,23, Go away. Just go away.,7,Big Bang Theory,23,5
36590,Penny,23, What gave you the right to mix my DNA with that of a killer gorilla?,7,Big Bang Theory,69,15
36592,Penny,23," Life? What life? Look at me, I'm a monster. And now I have blood on my hands, or paws. I don't know.",7,Big Bang Theory,101,22
36594,Penny,23," I love you, too. But I'm afraid I love killing more. Like, one day, I might actually try and kill you.",7,Big Bang Theory,103,21
36596,Penny,23," Actually, you know what? Can we do one more? I think I could do it better.",7,Big Bang Theory,75,16
36598,Penny,23," Well, I care. I mean, look, if we're gonna do this, why not try and make it something we're actually proud of?",7,Big Bang Theory,111,22
36600,Leonard,23," Whoa, whoa, hang on. There's no need to insult her.",7,Big Bang Theory,52,10
36602,Leonard,23, I'm her boyfriend.,7,Big Bang Theory,19,3
36604,Leonard,23," A little, yeah.",7,Big Bang Theory,16,3
36606,Penny,23, You can't do that. He's with me.,7,Big Bang Theory,33,7
36608,Penny,23, What? You can't fire me. I'm the star. I'm the girl that goes bananas. It says so on the poster.,7,Big Bang Theory,97,20
36614,Raj,23, Thanks for skipping the movie. I couldn't sit in that theatre for two hours wondering about Emily and that guy.,7,Big Bang Theory,112,20
36615,Sheldon,23," Oh, quite all right. After my forehead melanoma scare I've learned not to sweat the small stuff. Well, sorry, I don't have all the ingredients to make chai tea.",7,Big Bang Theory,161,29
36616,Raj,23, You don't have to make me anything.,7,Big Bang Theory,36,7
36617,Sheldon,23," No, I do. You're upset about Emily and you're Indian. I need to make you chai tea. Now, I have all the ingredients except cardamom seeds. Do you happen to have any on you?",7,Big Bang Theory,172,34
36618,Raj,23," Sorry, I left them in my turban.",7,Big Bang Theory,33,7
36619,Sheldon,23," Oh, I'll make English breakfast tea. They destroyed your culture. That's close enough. You know, I'm curious, why are you so upset about seeing Emily with another man?",7,Big Bang Theory,168,28
36620,Raj,23, Wouldn't you be upset if you saw Amy out with someone else?,7,Big Bang Theory,60,12
36621,Sheldon,23, Can't happen. We have an ironclad relationship agreement which precludes her from physical contact with anyone other than me.,7,Big Bang Theory,126,19
36622,Raj,23," But you don't have sex with her, either.",7,Big Bang Theory,41,8
36623,Sheldon,23," Slick, huh?",7,Big Bang Theory,12,2
36624,Raj,23," To be truthful, Emily and I haven't dated that long, and we never agreed to be exclusive to each other.",7,Big Bang Theory,104,20
36625,Sheldon,23, Have you had intercourse?,7,Big Bang Theory,26,4
36626,Raj,23, No.,7,Big Bang Theory,4,1
36627,Sheldon,23," Well, stick to your guns. There will be a lot of pressure.",7,Big Bang Theory,59,12
36630,Howard,23, It's like the world's fattest cuckoo clock.,7,Big Bang Theory,44,7
36632,Howard,23," No, it's not.",7,Big Bang Theory,14,3
36634,Howard,23, Maybe you're right. Anything she finds on the floor goes right in her mouth.,7,Big Bang Theory,77,14
36636,Howard,23," Hey, I'm a very paternal person. I'd be excellent at taking care of a baby.",7,Big Bang Theory,76,15
36638,Howard,23," I'm coming, you big baby.",7,Big Bang Theory,26,5
36640,Penny,23," You know, the only thing worse than doing a movie where they glue monkey hair to your ass is getting fired from a movie where they glue monkey hair to your ass.",7,Big Bang Theory,161,32
36642,Penny,23," Yeah, well, it's easy for you to say. You used to be famous.",7,Big Bang Theory,61,13
36644,Penny,23," All right, I'm sorry, you're famous.",7,Big Bang Theory,37,6
36646,Penny,23," God, what am I doing with my life?",7,Big Bang Theory,35,8
36647,Leonard,23, You having second thoughts about acting?,7,Big Bang Theory,41,6
36648,Penny,23," You were on set, you saw what it was like.",7,Big Bang Theory,43,10
36649,Leonard,23," Yeah, but it's not always that bad.",7,Big Bang Theory,36,7
36650,Penny,23," Oh, really?",7,Big Bang Theory,12,2
36651,Leonard,23," What about when you did, uh, Anne Frank at that cute little theater?",7,Big Bang Theory,69,13
36652,Penny,23, It was over a bowling alley.,7,Big Bang Theory,29,6
36653,Leonard,23," Yeah, but there was ample parking.",7,Big Bang Theory,35,6
36654,Penny,23, Are you done?,7,Big Bang Theory,14,3
36655,Leonard,23, And you were so good in the TV commercial.,7,Big Bang Theory,43,9
36656,Penny,23, It was for haemorrhoid cream.,7,Big Bang Theory,30,5
36657,Leonard,23, And I got itchy and swollen just watching you.,7,Big Bang Theory,47,9
36658,Penny,23," Leonard, you are really not cheering me up.",7,Big Bang Theory,44,8
36659,Leonard,23, Come on. How can you be sad when you're going home with all five-foot-six of this?,7,Big Bang Theory,83,16
36660,Penny,23," Hmm. You think you're five-foot-six, that's funny.",7,Big Bang Theory,51,7
36662,Raj,23," I don't understand it. I'm a nice guy, I have a great job, I'm well-educated, come from a good family. Why don't women want to be with me?",7,Big Bang Theory,139,28
36663,Sheldon,23," An interesting question. Well, good night.",7,Big Bang Theory,43,6
36664,Raj,23, What? Don't send me home. I can't be alone right now.,7,Big Bang Theory,54,11
36665,Sheldon,23, That's your problem. You can't be alone.,7,Big Bang Theory,41,7
36666,Raj,23, What do you mean?,7,Big Bang Theory,18,4
36667,Sheldon,23, How many women have you had dates with?,7,Big Bang Theory,40,8
36668,Raj,23, Eleven.,7,Big Bang Theory,8,1
36669,Sheldon,23, How many of those women did you think would become your perfect companion?,7,Big Bang Theory,75,13
36670,Raj,23, Eleven. Wait. Do I count the 200-pound Sailor Moon girl that Howard and I had a threesome with at Comic Con?,7,Big Bang Theory,109,21
36671,Sheldon,23, Sure.,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
36672,Raj,23, I'll stick with eleven. She liked Howard better.,7,Big Bang Theory,49,8
36673,Sheldon,23," Well, now do you see the problem?",7,Big Bang Theory,34,7
36674,Raj,23," Maybe. I, I don't know.It's late, I should, I should go. Look, I do get what you're saying. Instead of desperately clinging to any woman who will go out with me, I need to work on my fear of being alone.",7,Big Bang Theory,204,41
36675,Sheldon,23," I was trying to suggest chemical castration, but it's my bedtime, so whatever gets you out the door. Good night.",7,Big Bang Theory,113,20
36678,Howard,23," Shh, I just got her to sleep.",7,Big Bang Theory,30,7
36680,Howard,23, What took you so long? The grocery store is a few blocks away.,7,Big Bang Theory,63,13
36682,Howard,23, Then why do I smell coffee on your breath?,7,Big Bang Theory,43,9
36684,Howard,23," A mocha? Well, it must be nice to be queen.",7,Big Bang Theory,44,10
36686,Howard,23," Well, whose fault is that? I wanted to get a nurse, but you were all, I'm nice, I want to take care of people.",7,Big Bang Theory,111,24
36689,Howard,23, Thanks a lot. Now I have to go rub her belly again.,7,Big Bang Theory,52,12
36691,Raj,23, Hey.,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
36693,Raj,23," Of course. Please, come in.",7,Big Bang Theory,28,5
36695,Raj,23," Uh, look, you and I haven't made any commitments to each other.",7,Big Bang Theory,64,12
36697,Raj,23, It's okay.,7,Big Bang Theory,11,2
36699,Raj,23," Well, I mean, yeah, it freaked me out a little, but that's my issue, not yours.",7,Big Bang Theory,80,16
36701,Raj,23," Thank you. Not just for being upset, but for believing that could happen.",7,Big Bang Theory,74,13
36703,Raj,23," Well, me, neither.",7,Big Bang Theory,19,3
36705,Raj,23," Okay. Please. So, uh, you, you have tattoos?",7,Big Bang Theory,45,8
36707,Raj,23, I don't. I have a hole in my belly button that may or may not have been a piercing.,7,Big Bang Theory,84,19
36709,Raj,23," It's a piercing. So, uh, how many tattoos?",7,Big Bang Theory,43,8
36711,Raj,23," It's, uh, been a long time since I've seen a girl's really not her shoulder.",7,Big Bang Theory,77,15
36713,Raj,23," But, uh, before I take my shirt off, I just need like ten minutes to do some crunches.",7,Big Bang Theory,87,18
36715,Penny,23," Oh, my God. What a day.",7,Big Bang Theory,24,6
36716,Leonard,23, Can I get you anything?,7,Big Bang Theory,24,5
36717,Penny,23, No. I need to start making some smart decisions.,7,Big Bang Theory,49,9
36718,Leonard,23, With your career?,7,Big Bang Theory,18,3
36719,Penny,23, With my life.,7,Big Bang Theory,14,3
36720,Leonard,23, Like what?,7,Big Bang Theory,11,2
36721,Penny,23, I don't know. We could get married.,7,Big Bang Theory,36,7
36722,Leonard,23," Come on, be serious.",7,Big Bang Theory,21,4
36723,Penny,23, I am.,7,Big Bang Theory,6,2
36724,Leonard,23," Why? Because I'm a, a smart decision?",7,Big Bang Theory,38,7
36725,Penny,23," Well, yeah.",7,Big Bang Theory,12,2
36726,Leonard,23, So I'm like a bran muffin.,7,Big Bang Theory,27,6
36727,Penny,23," What? No, that's not what I'm saying.",7,Big Bang Theory,38,7
36728,Leonard,23," No, it's exactly what you're saying. I'm the boring thing you're choosing because I'm good for you.",7,Big Bang Theory,100,17
36729,Penny,23," What does it matter? The point is, I'm choosing you.",7,Big Bang Theory,53,10
36730,Leonard,23," Well, it matters a lot. I don't want to be a bran muffin. I, I want to be a Cinnabon, you know? A strawberry Pop-Tart. Something you're excited about even though it could give you diabetes.",7,Big Bang Theory,190,36
36731,Penny,23," Sweetie, you can be any pastry you want.",7,Big Bang Theory,41,8
36732,Leonard,23," No, no. No, it's too late. I'm your bran muffin. Probably fat-free and good for your colon.",7,Big Bang Theory,92,17
36733,Penny,23, You know what? Forget it. I never should've brought it up.,7,Big Bang Theory,59,11
36734,Leonard,23," You know I want to marry you, but you're only doing this because you got fired and you're feeling sorry for yourself.",7,Big Bang Theory,118,22
36735,Penny,23," Okay, it may look that way, but getting fired from that movie was the best thing that could have happened to me, okay? I finally realize I don't need to be famous or have some big career to be happy.",7,Big Bang Theory,200,40
36736,Leonard,23, Then what do you need?,7,Big Bang Theory,23,5
36737,Penny,23," You, you stupid Pop-Tart.",7,Big Bang Theory,26,4
36738,Leonard,23, Oh. Then I guess I'm in.,7,Big Bang Theory,25,6
36739,Penny,23, Really? You guess you're in?,7,Big Bang Theory,29,5
36740,Leonard,23," Not like, I guess I'm in. Like I guess, I'm in!",7,Big Bang Theory,48,11
36741,Leonard,23," So is that it? Are, are we engaged?",7,Big Bang Theory,36,8
36742,Penny,23," Yeah, I think so.",7,Big Bang Theory,18,4
36743,Leonard,23, All right.,7,Big Bang Theory,11,2
36744,Penny,23, What's wrong?,7,Big Bang Theory,14,2
36745,Leonard,23, I'm not sure. Just feels a little anticlimactic.,7,Big Bang Theory,49,8
36746,Penny,23," Yeah, it kind of does, huh?",7,Big Bang Theory,28,6
36747,Leonard,23," Oh, I know. This might help.",7,Big Bang Theory,29,6
36748,Penny,23, Where did you get a ring?,7,Big Bang Theory,26,6
36749,Leonard,23," I've had it for a couple years, not important. Penny, will you marry me?",7,Big Bang Theory,73,14
36750,Penny,23," Oh, my God, yes.",7,Big Bang Theory,17,4
36751,Leonard,23, This would have been so much more romantic if you didn't have monkey hair on your finger.,7,Big Bang Theory,90,17
36753,Howard,23, How you feeling?,7,Big Bang Theory,17,3
36755,Howard,23, I'm proud of us.,7,Big Bang Theory,17,4
36760,Howard,23, Welcome to Team Putz.,7,Big Bang Theory,22,4
36762,Leonard,24, How's your mom holding up?,7,Big Bang Theory,27,5
36763,Howard,24," She's doing okay, but we just lost another nurse.",7,Big Bang Theory,50,9
36764,Amy,24, How many is that now?,7,Big Bang Theory,22,5
36765,Howard,24," Two, and I know what you're thinking, she's eating them.",7,Big Bang Theory,57,10
36767,Sheldon,24," So, who's watching her now?",7,Big Bang Theory,28,5
36768,Howard,24, A bowl full of M&M's with a few Ambien tossed in.,7,Big Bang Theory,50,11
36769,Raj,24," What up, guys?",7,Big Bang Theory,15,3
36771,Leonard,24," Okay. Well, now that everyone's here, Penny and I have some big news. We're engaged.",7,Big Bang Theory,85,15
36772,Raj,24, And I thought me having sex with Emily was gonna be the big news.,7,Big Bang Theory,66,14
36773,Leonard,24," Hey, hey, what the hell?",7,Big Bang Theory,25,5
36775,Penny,24, You're right! Yay!,7,Big Bang Theory,19,3
36777,Raj,24," Boy, I'm so hungry today. I wonder why?",7,Big Bang Theory,40,8
36778,Howard,24, Because you had sex the other night?,7,Big Bang Theory,37,7
36779,Raj,24," You know what? That may be it. By the way, it isn't like riding a bike. Like, I fell off a few times.",7,Big Bang Theory,102,23
36780,Leonard,24," Hey, buddy.",7,Big Bang Theory,12,2
36781,Sheldon,24, Hello.,7,Big Bang Theory,7,1
36782,Leonard,24, You okay?,7,Big Bang Theory,10,2
36783,Sheldon,24, I just got called into President Siebert's office. The university won't let me switch my field of study to inflationary cosmology. They're forcing me to continue with string theory.,7,Big Bang Theory,182,29
36784,Howard,24, Why?,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
36785,Sheldon,24," He said it's why they hired me, it's, it's what my grant was designated for, and that everybody has to do things they don't want to do. He then gave an example of something he had to do, even though he didn't want to, which was look at my stupid face.",7,Big Bang Theory,252,51
36786,Leonard,24," That's a rude thing to say, out loud.",7,Big Bang Theory,38,8
36787,Sheldon,24," It's an outrage. Honestly, I'm tempted to leave the university.",7,Big Bang Theory,64,10
36788,Howard,24," You know, if you're really serious about that, I hear there are some exciting opportunities in home care for the old and fat.",7,Big Bang Theory,126,23
36789,Leonard,24," Whatever you do, just don't make any rash decisions.",7,Big Bang Theory,53,9
36790,Sheldon,24, I don't know. I am really aggravated.,7,Big Bang Theory,38,7
36791,Raj,24," When I'm feeling low, I have sex with a girl. But that's just me.",7,Big Bang Theory,66,14
36793,Howard,24," Oh, come on, give her a chance.",7,Big Bang Theory,32,7
36796,Howard,24," Yeah, maybe it's time we just release Ma back into the sea.",7,Big Bang Theory,60,12
36798,Howard,24," Well, then, we may need to get used to the idea that we're gonna be living here the next few months.",7,Big Bang Theory,101,21
36800,Howard,24," Well, what if we use our vacation time?",7,Big Bang Theory,40,8
36802,Howard,24, I don't know what else we can do.,7,Big Bang Theory,34,8
36806,Leonard,24," Hi, Mom. I have some exciting news.",7,Big Bang Theory,36,7
36808,Leonard,24," Before I tell you, will you promise to try and be happy for me and keep any concerns you have to yourself?",7,Big Bang Theory,107,22
36810,Leonard,24, I hate that you talk to him more than you talk to me.,7,Big Bang Theory,54,13
36812,Leonard,24, You know what? It's probably fine.,7,Big Bang Theory,35,6
36814,Leonard,24, I'm your son. What about the fact that she's good enough for me?,7,Big Bang Theory,65,13
36816,Leonard,24," Thanks, Mom.",7,Big Bang Theory,13,2
36818,Leonard,24," Yes, it would.",7,Big Bang Theory,15,3
36821,Penny,24," No, Mom, it's the same guy I've been going out with for the past two years. Yeah, the scientist. Well, it's complicated. I mean, he works with lasers and atomic magnets. No, I did not see it coming. No, we did not set a date. No, I am not pregnant. Yeah, this is a first for our family. All right, tell Dad I love him. I gotta go. All right, bye.",7,Big Bang Theory,347,71
36822,Amy,24, Atomic magnets?,7,Big Bang Theory,16,2
36823,Penny,24, Shut up.,7,Big Bang Theory,9,2
36825,Penny,24, You want some wine?,7,Big Bang Theory,20,4
36827,Penny,24, I think Leonard's mom's okay with me.,7,Big Bang Theory,38,7
36829,Amy,24," So, what are the living arrangements gonna be?",7,Big Bang Theory,47,8
36830,Penny,24," Well, haven't really talked about it yet, but I figure at some point, I'll move in with him, or he'll move in with me.",7,Big Bang Theory,119,24
36831,Amy,24," Well, with you not working, that makes financial sense.",7,Big Bang Theory,56,9
36833,Penny,24, Not a chance.,7,Big Bang Theory,14,3
36835,Penny,24, No.,7,Big Bang Theory,4,1
36837,Penny,24," Okay, then, yeah.",7,Big Bang Theory,18,3
36839,Penny,24," No, keep your money.",7,Big Bang Theory,21,4
36842,Leonard,24, What you working on?,7,Big Bang Theory,21,4
36843,Sheldon,24," I'm writing an appeal to the Faculty Senate, so that I can move on from string theory.",7,Big Bang Theory,87,17
36844,Leonard,24, Oh. How's it going?,7,Big Bang Theory,20,4
36845,Sheldon,24," You tell me. Dear Esteemed Colleagues, as you may know, I have requested to change my field of study. My decision to do so is, I believe, in the best interest of science. At your convenience, I'd be happy to explain it to you in words you'll understand.",7,Big Bang Theory,254,48
36846,Leonard,24, It's nice that you called them esteemed.,7,Big Bang Theory,41,7
36847,Sheldon,24, You're right. I'll take that out.,7,Big Bang Theory,34,6
36848,Leonard,24," So, listen, there was something I was hoping to float past you.",7,Big Bang Theory,64,12
36849,Sheldon,24, Mm.,7,Big Bang Theory,4,1
36850,Leonard,24," Now that Penny and I are engaged, I thought we might want to talk about our living arrangements.",7,Big Bang Theory,97,18
36851,Sheldon,24," Of course. She's spent many nights here, and you're worried about preserving the myth of her virginity before the wedding.",7,Big Bang Theory,123,20
36852,Leonard,24, I'm not.,7,Big Bang Theory,9,2
36853,Sheldon,24," Good, because not only has that ship sailed, if it hit an iceberg, countless men would perish.",7,Big Bang Theory,95,17
36854,Leonard,24," Actually, this is about where she and I are going to live.",7,Big Bang Theory,59,12
36855,Sheldon,24, What do you mean?,7,Big Bang Theory,18,4
36856,Leonard,24," Well, well, we might want to live together.",7,Big Bang Theory,44,8
36857,Sheldon,24," Oh, yeah, well, I've already given this some thought, and I'm willing to let Penny live with us one day a week for a trial period. Now, obviously, not when she's made cranky by the shedding of her uterine lining.",7,Big Bang Theory,213,40
36858,Leonard,24, That's very sweet. But we were thinking more of us maybe living together with not you.,7,Big Bang Theory,87,16
36859,Sheldon,24, I don't understand. How could we all live together if I'm not there?,7,Big Bang Theory,69,13
36860,Leonard,24," Look, I, I know this is, this is change, and that sounds scary.",7,Big Bang Theory,64,13
36861,Sheldon,24, Where are you going to go?,7,Big Bang Theory,27,6
36862,Leonard,24," I don't know. We just started to think about this. Maybe I'll move in with Penny, or maybe she and I'll take this place, and you can move across the hall.",7,Big Bang Theory,155,31
36863,Sheldon,24, Move across the hall? Did you take a marijuana?,7,Big Bang Theory,48,9
36864,Leonard,24," No, I did not.",7,Big Bang Theory,15,4
36865,Sheldon,24, Did you get hit on the head with a coconut?,7,Big Bang Theory,44,10
36866,Leonard,24, No.,7,Big Bang Theory,4,1
36867,Sheldon,24," Well, then, I'm all out of guesses. What? Me move across the hall. Why would you even suggest such a thing?",7,Big Bang Theory,108,21
36868,Leonard,24," Because I love Penny, and want to give her the life she deserves.",7,Big Bang Theory,66,13
36869,Sheldon,24, I see. You're putting your future bride's happiness above mine.,7,Big Bang Theory,64,10
36870,Leonard,24," Well, yeah.",7,Big Bang Theory,12,2
36871,Sheldon,24, Wow.,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
36873,Sheldon,24, How dare the university force me to go back to string theory?,7,Big Bang Theory,62,12
36874,Amy,24, They just don't appreciate you.,7,Big Bang Theory,32,5
36875,Sheldon,24," Yeah, and on top of that, Leonard has the audacity to suggest that now that he and Penny are engaged, he may not want to live with me any more.",7,Big Bang Theory,144,30
36876,Amy,24," Here, I made you some Strawberry Quik.",7,Big Bang Theory,39,7
36877,Sheldon,24," I have real problems here, Amy. I can't be mollified with a beverage designed for children. Mmm, yummy.",7,Big Bang Theory,104,18
36878,Amy,24," You know, this might work out for the best. I mean, you're always complaining about what a terrible roommate Leonard is. Like how he turns up the thermostat when you're not there.",7,Big Bang Theory,180,32
36879,Sheldon,24," Ugh, it's like walking into the Amazon. And not the good Amazon with one-day shipping. The awful one with birds and snakes.",7,Big Bang Theory,124,22
36880,Amy,24, You hate the sound of all those keys on his key chain.,7,Big Bang Theory,55,12
36881,Sheldon,24," Four keys! Who does he think he is, a warden?",7,Big Bang Theory,46,10
36882,Amy,24, See? Maybe you'll love living alone.,7,Big Bang Theory,37,6
36883,Sheldon,24, I don't know. Perhaps.,7,Big Bang Theory,23,4
36884,Amy,24," And if it turns out you don't, you and I could live together.",7,Big Bang Theory,62,13
36885,Sheldon,24," You and oh, sure, and while we're at it, why don't we get engaged, too? Why don't we get a little house, start a family? Enjoy our sunset years together? Do you hear yourself, woman?",7,Big Bang Theory,183,35
36886,Amy,24," Sheldon, it was just a thought.",7,Big Bang Theory,32,6
36887,Sheldon,24," No. Here's a thought. You're not moving in, Leonard's not moving out, everything stays exactly the way it is. And by the way, I saw you make this Strawberry Quik with syrup, you're supposed to use the powder.",7,Big Bang Theory,209,38
36888,Amy,24, It tastes the same.,7,Big Bang Theory,20,4
36889,Sheldon,24, No. The syrup tastes better and I don't like it.,7,Big Bang Theory,49,10
36891,Penny,24, This is so sweet. You never cook for me.,7,Big Bang Theory,41,9
36892,Leonard,24," Well, you cook for me all the time and, ugh.",7,Big Bang Theory,45,10
36893,Penny,24," If you don't like my cooking, why haven't you ever said anything?",7,Big Bang Theory,66,12
36894,Leonard,24, It's hard to talk with so much heavy chewing to do.,7,Big Bang Theory,52,11
36895,Penny,24, Sorry. I'll get better.,7,Big Bang Theory,24,4
36896,Leonard,24," I know you'll try. So, should we talk about setting a date?",7,Big Bang Theory,60,12
36897,Penny,24," Well, I'd like to pick one that works with my brother's schedule.",7,Big Bang Theory,66,12
36898,Leonard,24, Okay. And when would that be?,7,Big Bang Theory,30,6
36899,Penny,24," Uh, 12 to 18 months from now, depending on good behaviour.",7,Big Bang Theory,59,11
36900,Amy,24," Hi, is Sheldon here?",7,Big Bang Theory,21,4
36901,Leonard,24," No, I thought he was with you.",7,Big Bang Theory,31,7
36902,Amy,24," He was, but he stormed off and now he isn't answering his phone.",7,Big Bang Theory,65,13
36903,Leonard,24, What happened?,7,Big Bang Theory,15,2
36904,Amy,24, He was really angry that you suggested he move out.,7,Big Bang Theory,52,10
36905,Leonard,24, Oh.,7,Big Bang Theory,4,1
36906,Amy,24, I also mentioned that he and I could live together but he was too mad at you to realize what a great idea that is.,7,Big Bang Theory,115,25
36907,Leonard,24," Well, he's been having a couple of tough days. I'm sure he's fine. He probably just needs a little alone time to decompress.",7,Big Bang Theory,125,23
36908,Amy,24," You're probably right. So, what are you guys doing?",7,Big Bang Theory,52,9
36909,Penny,24," Well, Leonard cooked for me and now we're just having a nice dinner, you know, as a newly engaged couple.",7,Big Bang Theory,106,20
36910,Amy,24, That's nice.,7,Big Bang Theory,13,2
36911,Leonard,24," Anyway, as I was saying, Sheldon probably just needs a little alone time. â€˜Cause that's important. Not just for him, but for most anybody, really.",7,Big Bang Theory,149,25
36912,Amy,24," Don't I know it. What is that, polenta?",7,Big Bang Theory,40,8
36913,Penny,24," Amy, get out.",7,Big Bang Theory,14,3
36914,Amy,24, Right.,7,Big Bang Theory,7,1
36916,Sheldon,24, No.,7,Big Bang Theory,4,1
36918,Sheldon,24, What happened?,7,Big Bang Theory,15,2
36920,Sheldon,24, And you couldn't put it out?,7,Big Bang Theory,29,6
36922,Sheldon,24, So when will you reopen?,7,Big Bang Theory,25,5
36924,Sheldon,24," So, tomorrow?",7,Big Bang Theory,14,2
36926,Sheldon,24," Your life? The university is making me do string theory and my girlfriend loves me so much she wants to live with me. And now, the place I need to go when I'm sad is damp and smells funny.",7,Big Bang Theory,189,39
36928,Sheldon,24," No. I do not accept this. Everything is changing and I hate it. It stops now. I'm helping you get back on your feet. I would like to purchase this comic book, please.",7,Big Bang Theory,167,33
36930,Sheldon,24, Really? It's soaking wet.,7,Big Bang Theory,26,4
36932,Sheldon,24, Can you break a twenty?,7,Big Bang Theory,24,5
36934,Sheldon,24," You know what? I don't always recognize sarcasm, but I do right now, and I don't appreciate it. I'm sorry for your loss. But you're not the only one whose day has been a disaster.",7,Big Bang Theory,180,35
36937,Leonard,24, I haven't heard from Sheldon in a while. You think he's okay?,7,Big Bang Theory,62,12
36938,Penny,24," Oh, I'm sure he's fine.",7,Big Bang Theory,24,5
36939,Leonard,24, I'm gonna see where he is.,7,Big Bang Theory,27,6
36940,Penny,24, How?,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
36941,Leonard,24," Oh, I know his password, so I can track his phone.",7,Big Bang Theory,51,11
36942,Penny,24, You do that?,7,Big Bang Theory,13,3
36943,Leonard,24," Not always, but ever since he wandered off at the swap meet chasing a balloon, I get worried.",7,Big Bang Theory,94,18
36944,Penny,24," He can take care of himself. Look, we went over stranger danger and gave him that whistle.",7,Big Bang Theory,91,17
36945,Leonard,24, That's weird.,7,Big Bang Theory,14,2
36946,Penny,24, What?,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
36947,Leonard,24, He's at the train station.,7,Big Bang Theory,27,5
36948,Penny,24, So? He loves trains.,7,Big Bang Theory,21,4
36949,Leonard,24," It's dark out and he's alone, I don't like it. Let's go get him.",7,Big Bang Theory,65,14
36950,Penny,24, It's sweet how you look out for him. You're a good guy.,7,Big Bang Theory,56,12
36951,Leonard,24, It's not just that. My mother would kill me if I let something happen to him.,7,Big Bang Theory,78,16
36953,Raj,24," Dude, I'm so sorry.",7,Big Bang Theory,20,4
36954,Howard,24," Don't take this the wrong way, but did you do this for the insurance money?",7,Big Bang Theory,76,15
36956,Raj,24," We're here for you, man. Whatever you need, okay?",7,Big Bang Theory,50,9
36958,Raj,24," Sure, of course. Oh, actually, Emily was gonna spend the night.",7,Big Bang Theory,64,11
36960,Raj,24," Well, I can't take all the credit. She let me do it to her, but, uh, but I can always call her and cancel.",7,Big Bang Theory,107,24
36961,Howard,24, Hang on. I know a place you can stay and earn some money at the same time.,7,Big Bang Theory,75,17
36963,Howard,24," I just have to warn you, it'll involve humiliation, degradation and verbal abuse.",7,Big Bang Theory,82,13
36966,Leonard,24, Sheldon.,7,Big Bang Theory,9,1
36967,Sheldon,24, You tracked my phone?,7,Big Bang Theory,22,4
36968,Leonard,24, Yeah.,7,Big Bang Theory,6,1
36969,Sheldon,24," Boy, you chase one balloon for three miles.",7,Big Bang Theory,44,8
36970,Penny,24, We were worried about you.,7,Big Bang Theory,27,5
36971,Sheldon,24, Don't be melodramatic. I'm just getting on a train and leaving forever.,7,Big Bang Theory,72,12
36972,Leonard,24, Seriously? You don't even have a change of clothes or a toothbrush.,7,Big Bang Theory,68,12
36973,Sheldon,24, My plan is to stop at malls and buy what I need. It's called living off the land.,7,Big Bang Theory,82,18
36974,Leonard,24," Okay, I know you're upset and there's a lot of stuff going on, but it's nothing we can't work out. Come on, let's get you home.",7,Big Bang Theory,128,26
36975,Sheldon,24, No. I've reached my breaking point. I need to leave. Now.,7,Big Bang Theory,58,11
36976,Penny,24, And go where?,7,Big Bang Theory,14,3
36977,Sheldon,24, It doesn't matter.,7,Big Bang Theory,19,3
36978,Leonard,24, So a few things don't go your way and your best decision is to ride the rails like a hobo?,7,Big Bang Theory,91,20
36979,Sheldon,24, I suppose it is. Except I have a credit card. And I refuse to carry my laptop at the end of a stick. And I'd sooner die than eat beans out of a can.,7,Big Bang Theory,149,34
36980,Leonard,24," Come on, come home with us and tomorrow I'll, I'll take you to Legoland.",7,Big Bang Theory,73,14
36981,Sheldon,24, Legoland is not the solution to everything. And it's too much of a scene since that movie came out.,7,Big Bang Theory,100,19
36982,Leonard,24, Then what can I do?,7,Big Bang Theory,20,5
36983,Sheldon,24," Leonard, I am overwhelmed. Everything is changing and it's simply too much. I need to get away and think.",7,Big Bang Theory,106,19
36984,Leonard,24," Oh, come on, you know you're overreacting.",7,Big Bang Theory,43,7
36985,Penny,24," Leonard, hang on. Just come here. Maybe we need to let him go.",7,Big Bang Theory,63,13
36986,Leonard,24, What? Why?,7,Big Bang Theory,11,2
36987,Penny,24, It might be good for him.,7,Big Bang Theory,26,6
36988,Leonard,24, You know he can't take a trip like this by himself.,7,Big Bang Theory,52,11
36989,Penny,24, He's a grown man.,7,Big Bang Theory,18,4
36990,Leonard,24," No, he looks like a grown man. You've seen Freaky Friday, sometimes little kids end up in big person bodies.",7,Big Bang Theory,109,20
36991,Penny,24," Leonard, we can't protect him forever.",7,Big Bang Theory,39,6
36992,Leonard,24," I know, but",7,Big Bang Theory,12,3
36993,Penny,24," He'll be okay. You taught him well, Padawan.",7,Big Bang Theory,45,8
36994,Sheldon,24," Good Lord. Padawan's the student, not the teacher.",7,Big Bang Theory,51,8
36995,Penny,24," Seriously, let him go.",7,Big Bang Theory,23,4
36996,Leonard,24," Sheldon, if you really need to do this, I'm not gonna stand in your way.",7,Big Bang Theory,73,15
36997,Sheldon,24, I do.,7,Big Bang Theory,6,2
36998,Leonard,24, Okay. Good luck.,7,Big Bang Theory,17,3
36999,Penny,24, Be safe and call us.,7,Big Bang Theory,21,5
37000,Sheldon,24, I will.,7,Big Bang Theory,8,2
37001,Leonard,24," Bye, buddy. Sheldon?",7,Big Bang Theory,21,3
37002,Sheldon,24, Yes?,7,Big Bang Theory,5,1
37003,Leonard,24, I'm gonna miss you.,7,Big Bang Theory,20,4
37004,Sheldon,24, Of course you are.,7,Big Bang Theory,19,4
37005,Leonard,24, He just made that easier.,7,Big Bang Theory,26,5
37006,Penny,24, Mm.,7,Big Bang Theory,4,1
37009,Howard,24, You sure?,7,Big Bang Theory,10,2
37015,Howard,24, You call her Debbie?,7,Big Bang Theory,21,4
37017,Howard,24, Was that a little weird?,7,Big Bang Theory,25,5
37019,Howard,24," Okay, let's go.",7,Big Bang Theory,16,3
37022,Amy,24," Okay, Sheldon, thanks for checking in. Talk to you tomorrow? Oh, okay, bye.",7,Big Bang Theory,76,13
37023,Leonard,24, He's okay?,7,Big Bang Theory,11,2
37024,Amy,24, Actually sounds like he's doing pretty well.,7,Big Bang Theory,45,7
37025,Penny,24, I really think this is gonna be for the best.,7,Big Bang Theory,46,10
37026,Leonard,24," Me, too. And he was able to take a sabbatical from",7,Big Bang Theory,51,11
37027,Amy,24, How could you let him go?,7,Big Bang Theory,26,6
37029,Sheldon,1," Excuse me. Is it at all possible that you're knitting a pair of pants? Oh, well, no, you're understandably terrified. But, you know, allow me to explain. 45 days ago, um, I embarked on a railroad journey of healing because my university was making me do string theory, and my favorite comic book store burned down, and when my room mate got engaged, my girlfriend wanted to move in with me, which was no doubt a ploy just to see my, well, excuse my language, but my bathing suit parts. Uh, sir, may I use your phone?",8,Big Bang Theory,517,97
37031,Sheldon,1," Yeah, well, I understand that I'm half naked, but there is a reasonable explanation. While I slept in my sleeper car, all my possessions were stolen. Now, typically, I wear pyjamas, but I recently adopted a hobo lifestyle and pyjamas are the sleep-pants of the Man. I'll have you know, Mahatma Gandhi wore no pants and a nation rallied behind him. My good man, now, before you walk away, I know that I may appear deranged, but I am, in fact, a world-renowned physicist. Ask me the difference between a boson and a fermion. Go ahead, ask. Bosons have integer spin, fermions have half-integer spin. My legs are getting cold. Why won't anybody help me?",8,Big Bang Theory,650,115
37033,Leonard,1, Morning.,8,Big Bang Theory,9,1
37034,Penny,1, Hi. Want to do yoga with me?,8,Big Bang Theory,29,7
37035,Leonard,1," Um, let me just have some coffee first, and then I'll have the strength to tell you how much I won't be doing that.  Hello?",8,Big Bang Theory,124,25
37036,Sheldon,1," Hello, Leonard.",8,Big Bang Theory,16,2
37037,Leonard,1," Hey, buddy. Good to hear your voice.",8,Big Bang Theory,37,7
37038,Sheldon,1," Uh, I'm in Kingman, Arizona, and, uh, I need you to come pick me up.",8,Big Bang Theory,69,15
37039,Leonard,1, I'd love to. I'm just about to do yoga with Penny.,8,Big Bang Theory,51,11
37040,Sheldon,1," Leonard, I'm at the police station. I was robbed. They took my phone, my wallet, my iPad, everything.",8,Big Bang Theory,102,18
37041,Leonard,1," Oh, my God, are you okay?",8,Big Bang Theory,26,6
37042,Sheldon,1," No, I'm not okay. Uh, I'm wearing borrowed pants, I don't have I.D., and one of the officers here won't stop calling me chicken legs.",8,Big Bang Theory,134,25
37043,Leonard,1," Okay. Uh, I'll, I'll come get you. What's the address?",8,Big Bang Theory,55,10
37044,Penny,1," Hey, what's going on?",8,Big Bang Theory,22,4
37045,Leonard,1, He got all of his stuff stolen.,8,Big Bang Theory,32,7
37046,Penny,1, Oh.,8,Big Bang Theory,4,1
37047,Sheldon,1," 2530 East Andy Devine Avenue,",8,Big Bang Theory,30,5
37048,Leonard,1, Okay.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
37049,Sheldon,1, Hurry.,8,Big Bang Theory,7,1
37050,Leonard,1," Sheldon, hang tight. Hey, do you want me to bring anything?",8,Big Bang Theory,60,11
37051,Sheldon,1," Oh, yes, please. A pair of pants. And my toothbrush. Yeah, and my mail. And a really good comeback for chicken legs, because â€œI know you are, but what am I?â€ù was met with stony silence.",8,Big Bang Theory,190,36
37052,Leonard,1, I'll be there as soon as I can.,8,Big Bang Theory,32,8
37053,Penny,1, Is he okay?,8,Big Bang Theory,12,3
37054,Leonard,1," Yeah, he's fine, he's just a little rattled.",8,Big Bang Theory,45,8
37055,Penny,1, Oh.,8,Big Bang Theory,4,1
37056,Leonard,1, Feel like driving to Arizona with me?,8,Big Bang Theory,38,7
37057,Penny,1," I can't, I have that job interview.",8,Big Bang Theory,36,7
37058,Leonard,1," Oh, right.",8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
37059,Penny,1," Besides, I don't need six hours of your hair is different, why did you change your hair? I'm holding my breath until your hair grows back.",8,Big Bang Theory,139,26
37060,Leonard,1," All right, fine. Hey, can you think of a reason I shouldn't invite Amy to come with me?",8,Big Bang Theory,88,18
37061,Penny,1, Nope.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
37062,Leonard,1," Come on, you didn't even try.",8,Big Bang Theory,30,6
37064,Raj,1, Thanks for the lift.,8,Big Bang Theory,21,4
37065,Howard,1, What's wrong with your car?,8,Big Bang Theory,28,5
37066,Raj,1, I'm having my windows untinted.,8,Big Bang Theory,32,5
37067,Howard,1, Why?,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
37068,Raj,1, Got a hot girlfriend now. I want the haters to know.,8,Big Bang Theory,53,11
37069,Howard,1, What are you talking about? No one's paying attention to you.,8,Big Bang Theory,62,11
37070,Raj,1," Wow. How's that Hater-Ade taste, bro? Hey, this isn't the way to work.",8,Big Bang Theory,71,13
37071,Howard,1, I just want to pop in and make sure Ma's okay.,8,Big Bang Theory,47,11
37072,Raj,1, I thought Stuart was looking after her.,8,Big Bang Theory,40,7
37073,Howard,1," He was, but now that her cast is off, he moved out. And honestly, I'm kind of glad. It was getting a little weird.",8,Big Bang Theory,115,24
37074,Raj,1, How so?,8,Big Bang Theory,8,2
37075,Howard,1," I don't know, they're, chummy.",8,Big Bang Theory,31,5
37076,Raj,1, Like us?,8,Big Bang Theory,9,2
37077,Howard,1," No, not like us. Creepy chummy, like you and your dog.",8,Big Bang Theory,55,11
37078,Raj,1, She feeds him out of her own mouth?,8,Big Bang Theory,36,8
37079,Howard,1," I mean, he calls her Debbie, she calls him Stewie and they're all giggly around each other. And believe me, when food goes in that mouth, it does not come out.",8,Big Bang Theory,160,31
37080,Raj,1, So are you worried because he's replacing you as a son or are you worried because he's becoming her lover?,8,Big Bang Theory,107,20
37081,Howard,1," First of all, no one can replace me as a son. I'm her little matzo ball. And secondly, my mother is well past having any kind of sex life.",8,Big Bang Theory,139,29
37082,Raj,1," Okay, okay. Although many older women lead vibrant, active",8,Big Bang Theory,59,9
37083,Howard,1, I said well past it.,8,Big Bang Theory,21,5
37085,Sheldon,1," Excuse me, Officer Hernandez? Any leads on the person who stole my belongings?",8,Big Bang Theory,79,13
37087,Sheldon,1," Well, perhaps I can help. Sherlock Holmes always says when you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Now, have, have you tried doing that?",8,Big Bang Theory,184,29
37089,Sheldon,1," Well, maybe you should. There's lots of books called Sherlock Holmes, and there's no books called Officer Hernandez.",8,Big Bang Theory,117,18
37091,Leonard,1, Thanks again for coming. Six hours was gonna be a long drive by myself.,8,Big Bang Theory,72,14
37092,Amy,1," My pleasure. And I'm not angry at all that my boyfriend was in trouble and called you instead of me. I love that,",8,Big Bang Theory,114,23
37093,Leonard,1," Yeah, time's gonna fly by.",8,Big Bang Theory,27,5
37095,Penny,1, I haven't been on a job interview in years. I'm really nervous.,8,Big Bang Theory,64,12
37097,Penny,1, I don't have any experience in sales. Unless you count the bikini car wash I did in high school. But you already made me take that off my rÃ©sumÃ©.,8,Big Bang Theory,148,29
37099,Penny,1, They do?,8,Big Bang Theory,9,2
37101,Penny,1," Oh, I really appreciate this. I just hope I'm not in over my head.",8,Big Bang Theory,67,14
37103,Penny,1, I wish I felt more confident.,8,Big Bang Theory,30,6
37105,Penny,1," Oh, thank you, but maybe I should cancel.",8,Big Bang Theory,42,8
37107,Penny,1, But I don't know anything about pharmaceuticals.,8,Big Bang Theory,49,7
37109,Penny,1, They're comfortable.,8,Big Bang Theory,21,2
37111,Howard,1," Ma, I hope you're decent. Raj is here. You just started seeing naked women again, and I don't want you to be confused about where the boobs should be.",8,Big Bang Theory,151,29
37113,Howard,1," Uh, what are you doing here? I thought you moved out.",8,Big Bang Theory,54,11
37115,Howard,1, It's not that precious.,8,Big Bang Theory,24,4
37116,Raj,1," I'd like to back you up, but it sounds like it was pretty precious.",8,Big Bang Theory,68,14
37119,Howard,1, Or in her neck. Listen. You staying here seems like something she would've talked to me about.,8,Big Bang Theory,95,17
37121,Raj,1, It wouldn't kill you to pick up the phone.,8,Big Bang Theory,43,9
37123,Sheldon,1, Any word on my stolen items?,8,Big Bang Theory,29,6
37125,Sheldon,1," You know, Sherlock Holmes liked to use cocaine to sharpen his focus. But I'm sure those Cool Ranch Doritos are doing the trick.",8,Big Bang Theory,128,23
37126,Leonard,1, Sheldon.,8,Big Bang Theory,9,1
37127,Sheldon,1," Leonard. Oh, I'm so happy to see you.",8,Big Bang Theory,38,8
37128,Amy,1, Are you okay?,8,Big Bang Theory,14,3
37129,Sheldon,1," Oh, I'm fine. Why did you come?",8,Big Bang Theory,32,7
37130,Amy,1," What do you mean, why did I come? You're my boyfriend. I haven't seen you in over a month. I just drove six hours to help you out. Don't you have anything to say besides why did you come?",8,Big Bang Theory,188,39
37131,Sheldon,1," I do, but, I feel uncomfortable saying it out loud in front of these police officers.",8,Big Bang Theory,86,16
37132,Amy,1, Fine. Whisper it.,8,Big Bang Theory,18,3
37133,Sheldon,1, Shotgun.,8,Big Bang Theory,9,1
37135,Leonard,1," So, Sheldon, tell us about your trip. Where'd you go?",8,Big Bang Theory,54,10
37136,Sheldon,1," Where didn't I go? I went to New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Denver, Seattle.",8,Big Bang Theory,74,13
37137,Leonard,1, How were they?,8,Big Bang Theory,15,3
37138,Sheldon,1," Oh, I have no idea. I never left the train station.",8,Big Bang Theory,52,11
37139,Leonard,1, Hang on. You travelled across the entire country and never left a train station?,8,Big Bang Theory,81,14
37140,Sheldon,1, Why would I? That's where all the cool trains are.,8,Big Bang Theory,51,10
37141,Leonard,1," I'm sorry, so you never went outside?",8,Big Bang Theory,38,7
37142,Sheldon,1, Or had a single piece of fruit.,8,Big Bang Theory,32,7
37145,Penny,1," Well, I'm a people person. People like me. Some of my favourite people are people. I feel like I'm saying people a lot. People, people, people. Okay, I'm done.",8,Big Bang Theory,160,29
37147,Penny,1, People. Yes.,8,Big Bang Theory,13,2
37149,Penny,1," Uh, well, as a waitress, sales was a big part of my job. I mean, believe me, I convinced a lot of very large customers, who should not be eating cheesecake, to have more cheesecake. I mean, one of those chubsters even had an insulin pump.",8,Big Bang Theory,239,46
37151,Penny,1, People.,8,Big Bang Theory,8,1
37153,Howard,1," It's weird, right? A grown man in his thirties living with my mother.",8,Big Bang Theory,70,13
37154,Raj,1," That is weird. I thought he was, like, 45.",8,Big Bang Theory,43,9
37155,Howard,1," Come on, you don't think it's a little odd?",8,Big Bang Theory,44,9
37156,Raj,1," I don't know. I mean, she's lonely. He needs a place to stay. I doubt there's any funny business going on. And even if there was, who cares? They're both adults.",8,Big Bang Theory,162,31
37157,Howard,1, Who cares? You wouldn't care if I slept with your mom?,8,Big Bang Theory,55,11
37158,Raj,1," You know what? You're my best friend, and she's in a bad marriage. I give you my blessing.",8,Big Bang Theory,91,18
37159,Howard,1, This is stupid. I'm just gonna call my mother and be honest with her.,8,Big Bang Theory,70,14
37160,Raj,1, â€˜Cause that's what little matzo balls do.,8,Big Bang Theory,44,7
37165,Raj,1, This is the part where you talk.,8,Big Bang Theory,33,7
37168,Penny,1," Um, any chance his car needs to be washed by a girl in a bikini? No. Okay, I'm really sorry for wasting your time.",8,Big Bang Theory,115,24
37170,Penny,1," Okay, thanks. Um, I'm sorry, listen, could you do me a favour and not tell Bernadette how badly I blew this interview? She'll get upset. And honestly I'm a, a little terrified of her.",8,Big Bang Theory,184,34
37172,Penny,1," Yeah, kind of.",8,Big Bang Theory,15,3
37174,Penny,1," I know, but she's kind of a bully.",8,Big Bang Theory,35,8
37176,Penny,1," Me, too.",8,Big Bang Theory,9,2
37178,Penny,1, What happened?,8,Big Bang Theory,15,2
37180,Penny,1," Oh, my God, no.",8,Big Bang Theory,16,4
37182,Sheldon,1," At the hot dog stand in the Denver train station, Heinz ketchup. At the hot dog stand in the Salt Lake City train station, Heinz ketchup. At the hot dog stand in the Indianapolis train station?",8,Big Bang Theory,194,36
37183,Leonard,1, I don't care.,8,Big Bang Theory,14,3
37184,Sheldon,1," Wrong. Hunt's. Hey, Amy, what do you say? You ready to move on to the mustard round?",8,Big Bang Theory,85,17
37185,Amy,1, Have you not noticed that I've been sitting back here quietly stewing for the past two hours?,8,Big Bang Theory,94,17
37186,Sheldon,1, I just thought you were bad at the game.,8,Big Bang Theory,41,9
37187,Amy,1," I'm mad at you. How could you just go away like that without even saying good-bye, and then call Leonard for help instead of me?",8,Big Bang Theory,129,25
37188,Sheldon,1," Amy, may I please have a moment of privacy to speak with my roommate?",8,Big Bang Theory,70,14
37189,Amy,1, We're in a moving car. What do you expect me to do? Stick my fingers in my ears?,8,Big Bang Theory,81,18
37190,Sheldon,1," Well, I was thinking put your head out the window like a dog, but that'll work. Please? This'll be quick. Leonard? As soon as we get home, I want to have coitus with Amy. Okay, she can't hear. The reason I called you is because I didn't want Amy to know I couldn't make it on my own.",8,Big Bang Theory,284,58
37191,Leonard,1, What's the big deal?,8,Big Bang Theory,21,4
37192,Sheldon,1," Oh, of course it's no big deal to you. You idolize me, and nothing could ever knock me off that pedestal you put me on.",8,Big Bang Theory,120,25
37193,Leonard,1," Well, yeah, it's true. You, you are a god to me.",8,Big Bang Theory,49,11
37194,Amy,1, Can I stop now?,8,Big Bang Theory,16,4
37195,Leonard,1, Just tell her.,8,Big Bang Theory,15,3
37196,Sheldon,1, I called Leonard because I failed. And I didn't want you to think less of me.,8,Big Bang Theory,78,16
37197,Amy,1, You were worried about that?,8,Big Bang Theory,29,5
37198,Sheldon,1, Yes.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
37199,Amy,1," Sheldon, it's okay with me that you're not perfect.",8,Big Bang Theory,52,9
37200,Sheldon,1, Can I have one more moment with Leonard?,8,Big Bang Theory,41,8
37201,Amy,1, Sure.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
37202,Sheldon,1, Amy just hurt my feelings. I want to break up with her.,8,Big Bang Theory,56,12
37204,Howard,1," Now, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm kind of excited to see Sheldon.",8,Big Bang Theory,75,15
37206,Howard,1, She did?,8,Big Bang Theory,9,2
37208,Howard,1, What do you want?,8,Big Bang Theory,18,4
37210,Howard,1," You're right, I'm not. I think it's weird.",8,Big Bang Theory,43,8
37212,Howard,1," It is. He's a grown man. He's just gonna live there rent-free? How is that gonna motivate him to get off his butt and get a job? I mean, do you even have a plan?",8,Big Bang Theory,162,35
37214,Howard,1, Your mother and I? You're not my father.,8,Big Bang Theory,41,8
37216,Howard,1," Well, I didn't say I was your father.",8,Big Bang Theory,38,8
37219,Howard,1," Well, it's my house, it's my rules.",8,Big Bang Theory,36,7
37223,Howard,1, Don't talk to her like that. That is my mother. Wife. My wife. I said my wife.,8,Big Bang Theory,79,17
37225,Howard,1," Yeah, in my house.",8,Big Bang Theory,19,4
37228,Sheldon,1, I wish I'd never gone on that trip. I feel no better now than when I left.,8,Big Bang Theory,75,17
37229,Amy,1, But you still accomplished something.,8,Big Bang Theory,38,5
37230,Leonard,1," Yeah. If you had told anyone that you were going away on a train by yourself across the country, do you know what they would have said?",8,Big Bang Theory,136,27
37231,Sheldon,1, That I couldn't do it?,8,Big Bang Theory,23,5
37232,Leonard,1, Exactly. Right after they said yeah.,8,Big Bang Theory,37,6
37233,Amy,1, But you did do it. So what if it didn't all go your way? That's what makes it an adventure.,8,Big Bang Theory,92,20
37234,Sheldon,1," That's a good point. You know, I'm a lot like Gandalf the Grey. He fought the Balrog and emerged stronger than ever as Gandalf the White. I was robbed of my phone and pants, and I, too, came back stronger. And whiter, too, 'cause I wasn't in direct sunlight for six weeks.",8,Big Bang Theory,273,52
37235,Amy,1, See? This trip was good for you.,8,Big Bang Theory,33,7
37236,Sheldon,1," Indeed. I was the world's smartest caterpillar. And then after pupating in our nation's railway system, I've burst forth as the world's smartest butterfly.",8,Big Bang Theory,156,24
37237,Leonard,1, Butterfly could've gotten himself home from Arizona.,8,Big Bang Theory,53,7
37238,Sheldon,1," Yeah, I feel renewed. I'm ready to deal with any changes that come my way.",8,Big Bang Theory,75,15
37240,Penny,1," Hey, look who's back.",8,Big Bang Theory,22,4
37241,Sheldon,1, Your hair is different. You changed your hair. I can't take this. I'm out.,8,Big Bang Theory,75,14
37243,Sheldon,1, Would you like to see pictures from my trip?,8,Big Bang Theory,45,9
37244,Penny,1, I thought your phone got stolen.,8,Big Bang Theory,33,6
37245,Sheldon,1," Yeah, it did, but luckily all my photos got backed up to the Cloud.",8,Big Bang Theory,68,14
37246,Leonard,1, And you thought they all had a silver lining.,8,Big Bang Theory,46,9
37247,Sheldon,1," Here, day one, uh, this was the seat I was going to sit in but didn't because there were cracker crumbs on it. As it was first class, I suspect Ritz. This is the train bathroom. This is the Imodium I took so I would never have to use the train bathroom.",8,Big Bang Theory,254,52
37248,Penny,1, I cannot believe you travelled the entire country and never left the train station.,8,Big Bang Theory,84,14
37249,Sheldon,1," I know. You know, I almost died in a fire in Des Moines, but I stayed put. FYI, that's when the Imodium gave out.",8,Big Bang Theory,114,24
37251,Sheldon,2," I recently read that during World War Two, Joseph Stalin had a research program to create supersoldiers by having women impregnated by gorillas.",8,Big Bang Theory,145,23
37252,Howard,2, What a sick use of science.,8,Big Bang Theory,28,6
37253,Raj,2," Hey, as long as the baby's healthy.",8,Big Bang Theory,36,7
37254,Amy,2, I wonder if Stalin considered any other animals.,8,Big Bang Theory,49,8
37255,Leonard,2," Hippos are the deadliest creature. A half-human, half-hippo soldier would be pretty badass.",8,Big Bang Theory,92,13
37256,Howard,2," Yes, but when they're hungry-hungry, you can stop them with marbles.",8,Big Bang Theory,69,11
37257,Sheldon,2," Yeah, the correct animal for interspecies supersolider is koala. You would wind up with an army so cute it couldn't be attacked.",8,Big Bang Theory,129,22
37258,Raj,2," But half-man, half-owl could fly",8,Big Bang Theory,33,5
37259,Sheldon,2, The answer is cuddly soldiers with big flat noses. Moving on.,8,Big Bang Theory,62,11
37260,Howard,2," So, Penny, when's the new job start?",8,Big Bang Theory,37,7
37261,Penny,2, Next Monday.,8,Big Bang Theory,13,2
37263,Penny,2," Uh, not yet, but I will.",8,Big Bang Theory,25,6
37265,Penny,2, I said I'll get to it.,8,Big Bang Theory,23,6
37266,Sheldon,2," I'm sensing awkwardness, am I right?",8,Big Bang Theory,37,6
37267,Amy,2, Yes.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
37268,Sheldon,2, Swish.,8,Big Bang Theory,7,1
37270,Penny,2," Well, the first few weeks will be all training. They'll tell me everything I need to know.",8,Big Bang Theory,91,17
37272,Penny,2," Okay, so what, you want me to be like a teacher's pet?",8,Big Bang Theory,55,12
37274,Leonard,2," Mm, I don't know. Who here has ever been hurt because they were the teacher's pet?",8,Big Bang Theory,83,16
37275,Sheldon,2, It was like the rest of the class wanted Ms. McDonald to forget the quiz.,8,Big Bang Theory,74,15
37277,Sheldon,2,  Mrs. Davis.  Guess who?,8,Big Bang Theory,25,4
37279,Sheldon,2,"  That's right, good job. Hello. Uh, you wanted to see me?",8,Big Bang Theory,58,11
37281,Sheldon,2, Thank you. I assume you'd like to reopen our dialogue about the university forcing me to continue with string theory?,8,Big Bang Theory,118,20
37283,Sheldon,2," That's the one. I believe you went last, so, uh, please?",8,Big Bang Theory,57,11
37285,Sheldon,2," Wow. Pouting and running away actually worked. I must say, that may not be a lesson you want to reinforce with me. So, um, what is the solution?",8,Big Bang Theory,145,28
37287,Sheldon,2," But if I'm a professor, then I'll have to teach a class.",8,Big Bang Theory,57,12
37289,Sheldon,2, So your solution is to promote me and pay me more money so that I can impart my knowledge to the next generation of scientists?,8,Big Bang Theory,128,25
37291,Sheldon,2, You people are sick.,8,Big Bang Theory,21,4
37293,Penny,2, Hey. Ready to go to lunch?,8,Big Bang Theory,27,6
37294,Amy,2, Just give me a minute. I'm stimulating the pleasure cells of this starfish. I just need to turn it off.,8,Big Bang Theory,104,20
37295,Penny,2, What happens if you don't?,8,Big Bang Theory,27,5
37296,Amy,2, Then I have to sit through lunch knowing this starfish is having a better day than I am. Is Bernadette meeting us at the restaurant?,8,Big Bang Theory,133,25
37297,Penny,2," Uh, no. Actually, I didn't invite her.",8,Big Bang Theory,39,7
37298,Amy,2, How come?,8,Big Bang Theory,10,2
37299,Penny,2," Well, ever since she helped me get this job, she won't stop bugging me.",8,Big Bang Theory,72,14
37300,Amy,2," Well, I think she just wants you to do well, and she's worried that you won't 'cause you were just a stunningly poor waitress.",8,Big Bang Theory,127,24
37301,Penny,2, That is not true.,8,Big Bang Theory,18,4
37302,Amy,2, I'm still waiting on my mini corndogs from two years ago.,8,Big Bang Theory,58,11
37303,Penny,2," I told you, they'll be right out.",8,Big Bang Theory,34,7
37304,Amy,2," Okay, so no Bernadette.",8,Big Bang Theory,24,4
37305,Penny,2," Well, you saw her the other night. Am I wrong?",8,Big Bang Theory,47,10
37306,Amy,2," No, I just, I feel kind of uncomfortable talking about her like this. Usually when someone's being talked about behind their back, it's me and it's right in front of my face.",8,Big Bang Theory,175,32
37307,Penny,2, I'm sorry. I just need a little break from her.,8,Big Bang Theory,48,10
37308,Amy,2," I understand. You know, there is some research that indicates that sharing negative attitudes about a third party can be a powerful bonding force between two friends.",8,Big Bang Theory,167,27
37309,Penny,2," So, what are you saying?",8,Big Bang Theory,25,5
37310,Amy,2," I'm saying, in the spirit of science, what is that little skank's problem?",8,Big Bang Theory,75,13
37312,Raj,2," So, I've been trying to come up with a cute couple's nickname for me and Emily. What do you like better? Emippali or Koothrapemily?",8,Big Bang Theory,132,24
37313,Howard,2, Why is it your last name and her first name?,8,Big Bang Theory,45,10
37314,Raj,2," Oh, well, her last name is Sweeney, and something just didn't seem right about Koothrapeeney.",8,Big Bang Theory,94,15
37315,Leonard,2," Hey, how'd it go with human resources?",8,Big Bang Theory,39,7
37316,Sheldon,2," Awful. They're allowing me to move on from string theory, but they made me a junior professor and are requiring me to teach a class.",8,Big Bang Theory,133,25
37317,Raj,2, I don't understand. Why is it bad that you have to teach?,8,Big Bang Theory,58,12
37318,Sheldon,2, What a stupid question.,8,Big Bang Theory,24,4
37319,Leonard,2, The kids are gonna love him.,8,Big Bang Theory,29,6
37320,Sheldon,2, I can't believe I have to waste my time babysitting a bunch of grad students who probably think dark matter is what's in their diapers.,8,Big Bang Theory,136,25
37321,Leonard,2," This might not be that bad. Uh, you like telling people they're wrong.",8,Big Bang Theory,71,13
37322,Sheldon,2," Wrong, Just because I enjoyed that one doesn't mean I always do.",8,Big Bang Theory,65,12
37323,Raj,2, You enjoy giving people grades.,8,Big Bang Theory,32,5
37324,Sheldon,2," A valid point, but unoriginal. B-minus.",8,Big Bang Theory,40,6
37325,Howard,2, And you love the sound of your own voice.,8,Big Bang Theory,42,9
37326,Sheldon,2," Yeah, well, of course I do. Listen to it. It's like an earful of melted caramel.",8,Big Bang Theory,81,16
37327,Leonard,2," Look, most importantly, this will let you move on and study dark matter.",8,Big Bang Theory,73,13
37328,Sheldon,2," It is true that many of my heroes have taken students under their wings. Feynman, Einstein, Professor X. Humorously, in the case of Professor X, some of his students actually had wings. That's rich. I'll use that one to lighten the mood after my entire class fails the midterm.",8,Big Bang Theory,278,49
37330,Amy,2," Measuring starfish serotonin levels in response to one point two molar stimulation of pleasure cells. You like that, don't you? That's right, say my name.",8,Big Bang Theory,155,25
37332,Amy,2," Hey, what's going on?",8,Big Bang Theory,22,4
37334,Amy,2, No Penny?,8,Big Bang Theory,10,2
37336,Amy,2, Because you got her the job and you think she should be working harder to prepare for it?,8,Big Bang Theory,90,18
37338,Amy,2," I do, I see it.",8,Big Bang Theory,16,5
37340,Amy,2, That's outrageous.,8,Big Bang Theory,19,2
37342,Amy,2," If she doesn't do well, this could reflect poorly on you.",8,Big Bang Theory,58,11
37344,Amy,2, I don't know. The important thing is I am here for you so we can mutually disparage this unpleasing third party.,8,Big Bang Theory,113,21
37346,Leonard,2, Hey. We just wanted to see how your class was going. Where is everybody?,8,Big Bang Theory,73,14
37347,Sheldon,2, There is no class.,8,Big Bang Theory,19,4
37348,Howard,2, Did you send everyone to the principal's office already?,8,Big Bang Theory,57,9
37349,Sheldon,2, No one signed up.,8,Big Bang Theory,18,4
37350,Leonard,2," Well, that's not your fault.",8,Big Bang Theory,29,5
37351,Sheldon,2," I called the department secretary to see what happened. Apparently, I have a reputation for being obnoxious.",8,Big Bang Theory,109,17
37352,Leonard,2, What?,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
37353,Raj,2," Hey, Sheldon, I'm sorry.",8,Big Bang Theory,25,4
37354,Sheldon,2," No, it's fine. Now I can devote all my time to dark matter.",8,Big Bang Theory,60,13
37355,Raj,2," Aw, you brought cookies for everyone?",8,Big Bang Theory,38,6
37356,Sheldon,2," Oh, yes. Fig Newtons. I was going to ask them which scientist both helped to develop calculus and had a famous cookie named after him? And then after someone said Newton, I was going to tell them they're wrong. The cookies are named after a town in Massachusetts. And then I'd throw the cookies away.",8,Big Bang Theory,301,55
37357,Howard,2," Hey, what if I took your class?",8,Big Bang Theory,32,7
37358,Sheldon,2, Why would you do that?,8,Big Bang Theory,23,5
37359,Leonard,2," Yeah, why would you do that?",8,Big Bang Theory,29,6
37360,Raj,2, What's wrong with you?,8,Big Bang Theory,23,4
37361,Howard,2," I'm thinking about getting my doctorate, and he wants to teach. Why not?",8,Big Bang Theory,73,13
37362,Sheldon,2," Oh, Howard. I appreciate the gesture, but this is a graduate-level physics class. I don't think you'd understand a single thing I was talking about.",8,Big Bang Theory,149,25
37363,Raj,2," Ask why not again, I've got an answer.",8,Big Bang Theory,39,8
37364,Howard,2," Sheldon, I'm more than smart enough to take your class.",8,Big Bang Theory,56,10
37365,Sheldon,2, No.,8,Big Bang Theory,4,1
37366,Howard,2, Yes.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
37367,Sheldon,2, How would you determine the ground state of a quantum system with no exact solution?,8,Big Bang Theory,85,15
37368,Howard,2, I would guess a wave-function and then vary its parameters until I found the lowest energy solution.,8,Big Bang Theory,101,17
37369,Sheldon,2," Hmm. Do you know how to integrate X squared times E to the minus X, without looking it up?",8,Big Bang Theory,91,19
37370,Howard,2," I'd use Feynman's trick, differentiate under the integral sign.",8,Big Bang Theory,64,9
37371,Sheldon,2," Okay. Um, what is the correct interpretation of quantum mechanics?",8,Big Bang Theory,67,10
37372,Howard,2," Since every interpretation gives exactly the same answer to every measurement, they are all equally correct. However, I know you believe in the Many Worlds Interpretation, so I'll say that. Now do you think I'm smart enough?",8,Big Bang Theory,225,37
37373,Sheldon,2, No.,8,Big Bang Theory,4,1
37374,Howard,2," Oh, come on. You might've gone to school for a couple more years than me, but guess what, engineers are just as smart as physicists.",8,Big Bang Theory,133,25
37375,Sheldon,2, You take that back.,8,Big Bang Theory,20,4
37376,Howard,2, No.,8,Big Bang Theory,4,1
37378,Amy,2," So, after drinks with Bernadette, I get home, and Penny calls to complain about her. And then while I'm talking to Penny, I get a text from Bernadette.",8,Big Bang Theory,152,28
37379,Sheldon,2, I am trying to prepare my lesson plan for Howard. Why are you telling me this?,8,Big Bang Theory,79,16
37380,Amy,2," Because it's taken 15 years, but high school is finally awesome. I love them both, but I'm in the centre now, and I love that even more.",8,Big Bang Theory,137,27
37381,Sheldon,2," Amy, please. I am trying to figure out a way to intellectually emasculate a dear friend of mine.",8,Big Bang Theory,97,18
37382,Amy,2, But I'm just,8,Big Bang Theory,13,3
37383,Sheldon,2, Not now.,8,Big Bang Theory,9,2
37384,Amy,2," You better watch that attitude, buddy. You're dating the popular girl now.",8,Big Bang Theory,75,12
37386,Leonard,2, Hmm. You're up late.,8,Big Bang Theory,21,4
37387,Sheldon,2," Oh, I'm working on my lesson plan for Wolowitz. He is going to be so lost. Look at this section over here. Even I don't really understand it.",8,Big Bang Theory,142,28
37388,Leonard,2," Sheldon, why are you doing this?",8,Big Bang Theory,33,6
37389,Sheldon,2," I'm a teacher, Leonard. It's my job.",8,Big Bang Theory,37,7
37390,Leonard,2," No, I mean, why are you going to so much trouble to prove that you're smarter than Wolowitz?",8,Big Bang Theory,93,18
37391,Sheldon,2," Oh, it's no trouble, it's actually a pleasure.",8,Big Bang Theory,47,8
37392,Leonard,2," You want to know what I think? I think the idea that someone could be as smart as you, or even smarter, scares the pants off you, and you can't deal with it.",8,Big Bang Theory,158,33
37393,Sheldon,2," Interesting point. You're suggesting that I have emotional issues below my consciousness which drive my behaviour, thus causing me to lash out at anything or anyone that threatens my intellectual superiority.",8,Big Bang Theory,209,31
37394,Leonard,2, Might be something to think about.,8,Big Bang Theory,35,6
37395,Sheldon,2, Leonard?,8,Big Bang Theory,9,1
37396,Leonard,2, Yeah.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
37397,Sheldon,2, Howard's allergic to peanuts. How can I use that against him?,8,Big Bang Theory,62,11
37399,Howard,2, Hey.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
37400,Sheldon,2," Okay, now that everyone's here, we can begin.",8,Big Bang Theory,46,8
37401,Howard,2," Before we do, I just talked to Leonard. And if you're gonna spend all your time trying to belittle me by making this class unnecessarily hard, then I'm out. But if you're interested in making a sincere effort to be a good teacher, then I'm willing to give this a shot.",8,Big Bang Theory,269,51
37402,Sheldon,2, I suppose that's a fair request. There's no reason we both can't benefit from this experience.,8,Big Bang Theory,95,16
37403,Howard,2, Okay.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
37404,Sheldon,2," Okay. Well, then, uh, first things first. Um, are you familiar with the Brachistochrone problem?",8,Big Bang Theory,97,15
37405,Howard,2, I am.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,2
37406,Sheldon,2, Good. And how it relates to the calculus of variations?,8,Big Bang Theory,56,10
37407,Howard,2, It's an inverted cycloid.,8,Big Bang Theory,26,4
37408,Sheldon,2," Wonderful. Now, what about Euler-Lagrange theorems?",8,Big Bang Theory,52,6
37409,Howard,2, That's where I'm a little fuzzy.,8,Big Bang Theory,33,6
37410,Sheldon,2," Ha! I knew it. All right. We have a lot of information to cover before your first test. Which, by the way, is in eight minutes. The good news is I'm grading on a curve, so you're pretty much guaranteed a C.",8,Big Bang Theory,207,42
37411,Howard,2," All I do is win, win, win no matter what.",8,Big Bang Theory,42,10
37412,Sheldon,2, What are you doing?,8,Big Bang Theory,20,4
37413,Howard,2," Everybody hands go up, up and they stay there!",8,Big Bang Theory,47,9
37414,Sheldon,2, What are you doing?,8,Big Bang Theory,20,4
37415,Howard,2," If you're gonna be a crappy teacher, then I'm gonna be a crappy student.  Uh, uh, Ludacris going in on the verse. 'cause I never been defeated and I won't stop now",8,Big Bang Theory,164,32
37416,Sheldon,2, Will you stop it. This is a classroom. This is not American Bandstand.,8,Big Bang Theory,71,13
37417,Howard,2, Okay.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
37418,Sheldon,2," Now, where was I? Let's see. Oh, yes. Over here. You What are you doing now?",8,Big Bang Theory,77,16
37419,Howard,2, Making a straw.,8,Big Bang Theory,16,3
37420,Sheldon,2, Why?,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
37421,Howard,2, So I can shoot you with a spitball.,8,Big Bang Theory,36,8
37422,Sheldon,2," You're not going to do that, and I'll tell you why. This is an institution of higher learning, I am your professor, and you're going to treat me with the prop You shot your spit in my mouth!",8,Big Bang Theory,191,38
37423,Howard,2, Is that gonna be on the test? Because I don't think I can do that again.,8,Big Bang Theory,73,16
37425,Amy,2," Hey, girlfriend. Can I get a what what?",8,Big Bang Theory,40,8
37426,Penny,2, What?,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
37427,Amy,2," Close enough. Um, I was just calling to see what you were up tonight. Thought maybe we could hit up Color Me Mine, maybe sneak in some Pinot Greej. Whatevs.",8,Big Bang Theory,157,30
37428,Penny,2," Uh, thanks, but I think I'm gonna stay in and go over the stuff Bernadette gave me.",8,Big Bang Theory,84,17
37429,Amy,2," Oh. Oh, I hear you. Try and get that nag off your back, right? I mean, you're not a bicycle, why's she riding you like that?",8,Big Bang Theory,125,26
37430,Penny,2," No, I think she was just trying to help. Plus, I really want to do well at this job. So",8,Big Bang Theory,88,20
37431,Amy,2," Okay, good luck. And call me later, you know, if you decide she's a bitch or something. Hey, girlfriend.",8,Big Bang Theory,105,19
37433,Amy,2," Tonight. You, me, Color Me Mine. Maybe we sneak in some Pinot, make it Color Me Wine.",8,Big Bang Theory,86,17
37435,Amy,2," Oh. Well, good luck getting her to do that. She's probably off getting another manicure. You remember when she did that? You remember?",8,Big Bang Theory,135,23
37437,Amy,2," Oh. Great. I'm happy for you guys. You know, when the two of you aren't getting along, it puts me in a really weird position.",8,Big Bang Theory,126,25
37439,Amy,2," You mean, like, where she's nice to your face? Okay got it. Bye. Hey, boyfriend.",8,Big Bang Theory,81,15
37440,Sheldon,2, Can't talk. Spitball. Probably gonna die.,8,Big Bang Theory,42,6
37442,Sheldon,2, Well?,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
37443,Leonard,2," Sheldon, I promise. Your uvula does not have an STD.",8,Big Bang Theory,53,10
37444,Sheldon,2, Are you sure? It just doesn't feel as innocent as it used to.,8,Big Bang Theory,62,13
37445,Howard,2, You reported me to human resources?,8,Big Bang Theory,36,6
37446,Sheldon,2, You violated the sanctity of my mouth.,8,Big Bang Theory,39,7
37447,Howard,2," Well, I dropped your class, so I hope you're happy.",8,Big Bang Theory,52,10
37448,Sheldon,2, I told you you weren't smart enough to take it.,8,Big Bang Theory,48,10
37449,Howard,2," I'm smart enough, Sheldon. Asking me a bunch of questions about a topic I'm not familiar with doesn't prove anything. I could do the same to you.",8,Big Bang Theory,146,27
37450,Sheldon,2," Yeah, try me.",8,Big Bang Theory,14,3
37451,Howard,2," Okay. You enjoy making fun of engineering so much, how do you quantify the strength of materials?",8,Big Bang Theory,98,17
37452,Sheldon,2, Young's modulus.,8,Big Bang Theory,17,2
37453,Raj,2, Is that right?,8,Big Bang Theory,15,3
37454,Howard,2," Yeah. Okay, how do you prevent eddy currents in a transformer?",8,Big Bang Theory,63,11
37455,Sheldon,2, Laminate the core material.,8,Big Bang Theory,28,4
37456,Leonard,2," Come on, give him a hard one.",8,Big Bang Theory,30,7
37457,Howard,2," That was a hard one. All right. How does the flow rate in a pipe depend on its diameter? You don't know, do you? What's the matter, smart guy? Don't know Poiseuille's law?",8,Big Bang Theory,172,33
37458,Sheldon,2, Thank goodness I got it. Now I can quit checking my stool.,8,Big Bang Theory,59,12
37461,Penny,2," Headaches, dizziness and nausea.",8,Big Bang Theory,33,4
37463,Penny,2, Those are also the side effects of having a 75-year-old man with an erection climb on top of you.,8,Big Bang Theory,98,19
37465,Penny,2," Uh, no. I can keep going.",8,Big Bang Theory,26,6
37467,Penny,2," Okay, good. She seemed like she really wanted to go out tonight.",8,Big Bang Theory,65,12
37468,Amy,2," Hey, girl.",8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
37470,Leonard,2," Okay, next question, for the Butterfinger. How long is a galactic yea",8,Big Bang Theory,70,12
37471,Raj,2, 250 million years.,8,Big Bang Theory,19,3
37472,Leonard,2, Yes.  ,8,Big Bang Theory,7,1
37473,Howard,2," Okay, this one is for a Cadbury Creme Egg.",8,Big Bang Theory,43,9
37474,Sheldon,2, Oh! It's not even Easter time. This is crazy.,8,Big Bang Theory,46,9
37475,Howard,2," Which Archimedean solid has 20 regular triangular faces, 30 square faces, 12 pentagonal faces, 60 vertices and 120 edges?",8,Big Bang Theory,122,19
37477,Leonard,2, We are so smart.,8,Big Bang Theory,17,4
37478,Raj,2, Why didn't girls like us in high school?,8,Big Bang Theory,41,8
37479,Howard,2, Because we were awkward and weird and couldn't play sports!,8,Big Bang Theory,60,10
37480,Leonard,2, Right again. ,8,Big Bang Theory,14,2
37482,Howard,3," So, how does this game work? I just throw it, like a real ball?",8,Big Bang Theory,64,14
37483,Leonard,3," Yeah, just nice and easy, right over the plate.",8,Big Bang Theory,48,9
37484,Howard,3, All right.,8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
37485,Raj,3," You suck, Wolowitz.",8,Big Bang Theory,20,3
37486,Howard,3, What's that about?,8,Big Bang Theory,19,3
37487,Raj,3, I'm heckling you. It's a beloved part of baseball.,8,Big Bang Theory,51,9
37488,Sheldon,3," He's right. And given that you're probably still waiting to be picked for a game that was played in fifth grade, I'm sure you do suck.",8,Big Bang Theory,135,26
37489,Penny,3, Hi. What's going on?,8,Big Bang Theory,21,4
37490,Leonard,3, Baseball.,8,Big Bang Theory,10,1
37491,Penny,3," Okay, this is not what I meant when I said go outside and play.",8,Big Bang Theory,64,14
37492,Leonard,3, He's practicing.,8,Big Bang Theory,17,2
37493,Penny,3, For what?,8,Big Bang Theory,10,2
37494,Howard,3," The Angels wanted an astronaut to throw out the first pitch, so guess who they called?",8,Big Bang Theory,87,16
37495,Penny,3," What, you? Really?",8,Big Bang Theory,19,3
37496,Howard,3," Well, a lot of people who weren't available, but then me.",8,Big Bang Theory,58,11
37497,Penny,3, That's so cool. Congratulations. I guess that makes you the athlete of the group.,8,Big Bang Theory,82,14
37498,Sheldon,3," Well, not just him. May I remind you that you're talking to the seeker, beater, chaser and water boy of the third place Griffith Park Quidditch team.",8,Big Bang Theory,150,27
37499,Penny,3, I know. Watching your boyfriend run around with a broomstick between his legs isn't something you forget.,8,Big Bang Theory,106,17
37500,Leonard,3," C'mon now, throw one.",8,Big Bang Theory,22,4
37501,Howard,3," All right, here we go.",8,Big Bang Theory,23,5
37502,Raj,3, You look like a jackass.,8,Big Bang Theory,25,5
37503,Howard,3, Cut it out. You're hurting my feelings.,8,Big Bang Theory,40,7
37504,Leonard,3, Now you know why we're not outside.,8,Big Bang Theory,36,7
37506,Sheldon,3, Did you enjoy my lecture?,8,Big Bang Theory,26,5
37507,Amy,3," No, and neither did our waiter.",8,Big Bang Theory,32,6
37508,Sheldon,3," Well, if you're going to serve Cornish game hen, you should either be familiar with the history of Cornwall or be prepared to learn it.",8,Big Bang Theory,136,25
37509,Amy,3, It's hard to argue with that. And I know because I saw a sad man with a pepper mill desperately try and fail.,8,Big Bang Theory,110,23
37510,Penny,3," Hey, how was dinner?",8,Big Bang Theory,21,4
37511,Sheldon,3," Good, I had Cornish game hen.",8,Big Bang Theory,30,6
37512,Leonard,3," Oh, that poor waiter.",8,Big Bang Theory,22,4
37513,Amy,3," Sheldon, how about tomorrow night we see a movie?",8,Big Bang Theory,50,9
37514,Penny,3, You guys are going out two nights in a row?,8,Big Bang Theory,44,10
37515,Sheldon,3," I missed a number of date nights while I was on my train trip, and I'm contractually obligated to make them up under the terms of the Relationship Agreement.",8,Big Bang Theory,158,29
37516,Penny,3, That's so hot.,8,Big Bang Theory,15,3
37517,Amy,3," It's better than hot, it's binding.",8,Big Bang Theory,36,6
37518,Sheldon,3," If you're free tomorrow night, I'd love to have you join us on a double date.",8,Big Bang Theory,78,16
37519,Penny,3, Aw.,8,Big Bang Theory,4,1
37520,Amy,3, You are aware that a double date doesn't count as two dates.,8,Big Bang Theory,61,12
37521,Sheldon,3," Oh. Well, then come or don't. I don't care.",8,Big Bang Theory,44,9
37524,Howard,3," Hey, even professional pitchers need a rubdown after the game.",8,Big Bang Theory,63,10
37526,Howard,3," For your information, I also gave Leonard one hell of a high five.",8,Big Bang Theory,67,13
37528,Howard,3, They're doing Space Day and NASA asked me. I felt like I couldn't say no.,8,Big Bang Theory,74,15
37530,Howard,3," Thank you, that would be great.",8,Big Bang Theory,32,6
37532,Howard,3, What's wrong with the way I run?,8,Big Bang Theory,33,7
37534,Penny,3," Sheldon, I'm surprised you'd choose to go to a pub.",8,Big Bang Theory,52,10
37535,Sheldon,3," At our committee meeting, Amy made a motion for a picnic in a park, but I tacked so many amendments on that thing it sank like a lead balloon.",8,Big Bang Theory,143,29
37536,Amy,3, I then suggested a pub.,8,Big Bang Theory,24,5
37537,Sheldon,3," Yeah, which I was initially sceptical of until I saw online that they serve Yorkshire pudding.",8,Big Bang Theory,95,16
37538,Leonard,3, You don't even like Yorkshire pudding.,8,Big Bang Theory,39,6
37539,Sheldon,3," No, it's yucky, but informing people about the history of Yorkshire is yummy, yum-yum.",8,Big Bang Theory,87,14
37540,Amy,3," After a lively debate, that proposal passed by a two-zero margin.",8,Big Bang Theory,66,11
37541,Leonard,3, Nice to see a busy couple keep the spark of bureaucracy alive.,8,Big Bang Theory,63,12
37542,Sheldon,3," Ignore them, Amy. They're just jealous because they'll never have a relationship as good as ours.",8,Big Bang Theory,98,16
37543,Penny,3, Isn't this when he says bazooka or something?,8,Big Bang Theory,46,8
37544,Sheldon,3," I wasn't making a joke, I was merely stating fact. Amy and I have a superior relationship to yours.",8,Big Bang Theory,100,19
37545,Leonard,3," You don't honestly think that, do you?",8,Big Bang Theory,39,7
37546,Sheldon,3," Leonard, I assumed you knew. The ranking of relationships in our circle by quality is me and Amy, Howard and Bernadette, Raj and his girlfriend, Penny and Chardonnay, Penny and you.",8,Big Bang Theory,182,31
37547,Leonard,3," There isn't any ranking. And if there were, we wouldn't be at the bottom of it.",8,Big Bang Theory,80,16
37548,Penny,3," Yeah, and actually, I drink Sauvignon Blanc.",8,Big Bang Theory,45,7
37549,Leonard,3, That's the part you have a problem with?,8,Big Bang Theory,41,8
37550,Penny,3, Relax.,8,Big Bang Theory,7,1
37551,Amy,3," There they go, fighting again. You'd never hear her talk that way to Sauvignon Blanc.",8,Big Bang Theory,86,15
37553,Raj,3," So you never played baseball as a kid, not even Little League?",8,Big Bang Theory,63,12
37554,Howard,3," Well, I was going to, but the day of tryouts I found my dad's Playboy collection. Threw my arm out.",8,Big Bang Theory,100,20
37556,Howard,3, Great. You take this and say when to stop. How much further?,8,Big Bang Theory,61,12
37558,Howard,3, How about now?,8,Big Bang Theory,15,3
37560,Howard,3, Are you saying stop and we're just too far away to hear you?,8,Big Bang Theory,61,13
37562,Howard,3, Are you kidding me?!,8,Big Bang Theory,21,4
37564,Howard,3, There's no way this is sixty feet.,8,Big Bang Theory,35,7
37566,Howard,3, You realize this isn't one of those times I want you to exaggerate how long something is.,8,Big Bang Theory,90,17
37568,Leonard,3," Okay, I got to, I, I, I, I got to ask. What makes you think that your relationship is so wonderful and ours isn't?",8,Big Bang Theory,115,24
37569,Sheldon,3," For starters, we enjoy spending time together.",8,Big Bang Theory,47,7
37570,Leonard,3, So do we. And I've seen you guys ignore each other for hours doing totally different things.,8,Big Bang Theory,93,17
37571,Sheldon,3, It's called parallel play.,8,Big Bang Theory,27,4
37572,Leonard,3," Yeah, toddlers do that.",8,Big Bang Theory,24,4
37573,Sheldon,3, Not as well as we do.,8,Big Bang Theory,22,6
37574,Leonard,3, You believe this guy? He has to be the best at everything.,8,Big Bang Theory,59,12
37575,Penny,3, So what? Why do you even care?,8,Big Bang Theory,31,7
37576,Sheldon,3," Oh, listen to them. Not even married and the honeymoon's over.",8,Big Bang Theory,63,11
37577,Leonard,3, Whatever. You can't even go on a date without checking your relationship agreement.,8,Big Bang Theory,84,13
37578,Sheldon,3," If you've got a problem basing a relationship on a contract, I'd like to tell you about 13 plucky colonies that entered a relationship agreement called the U.S. Constitution. And it may not be cool to say so, but I think that love affair is still pretty hot today.",8,Big Bang Theory,265,49
37579,Amy,3," It's a good thing I'm not wearing flag underwear right now, 'cause there's about to be a fire.",8,Big Bang Theory,95,18
37582,Howard,3," That's your help? That's like saying here's how you fly a plane, get in the airplane, know where you want to go and fly it.",8,Big Bang Theory,124,25
37584,Raj,3," Come on Howard, fire it in.",8,Big Bang Theory,28,6
37587,Amy,3, So when do you guys plan on getting married?,8,Big Bang Theory,45,9
37588,Penny,3," Uh, we're not sure. But I want to wait long enough to prove to my mother I'm not pregnant.",8,Big Bang Theory,91,19
37589,Sheldon,3, May I have one of your fries?,8,Big Bang Theory,30,7
37590,Amy,3, Of course. Can I have a bite of your burger?,8,Big Bang Theory,45,10
37591,Sheldon,3, Absolutely not.,8,Big Bang Theory,16,2
37592,Leonard,3, Some perfect couple. He won't even share his food with her.,8,Big Bang Theory,60,11
37593,Sheldon,3, It has avocado on it. She's allergic to avocado. Are you so jealous of our relationship you want Amy to die?,8,Big Bang Theory,109,21
37594,Leonard,3, I'm not jealous. I just think it's silly for you to compare relationships like they're something that can be quantified.,8,Big Bang Theory,121,20
37595,Sheldon,3," Everything is quantifiable. That French fry? A seven. Spider-Man? A nine. The number nine? Oddly, only a four.",8,Big Bang Theory,111,18
37596,Leonard,3, How ridiculous is he?,8,Big Bang Theory,22,4
37597,Penny,3, A hundred.,8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
37598,Leonard,3," Sheldon, you're just assigning random numbers to things based on your opinion.",8,Big Bang Theory,79,12
37599,Sheldon,3," No, I'm not. French fries have three variables, crispiness, saltiness and shape. Which is why a curly fry only gets a two. If I wanted curls for dinner, I'd order a clown wig.",8,Big Bang Theory,176,33
37600,Penny,3," Well, a relationship is more complicated than a French fry.",8,Big Bang Theory,60,10
37601,Sheldon,3," Not according to the work of Berscheid, Snyder and Omoto.",8,Big Bang Theory,58,10
37602,Penny,3," Oh, what did those rascals do now?",8,Big Bang Theory,35,7
37603,Amy,3," They developed the Relationship Closeness Inventory, which predicts the stability of a couple based on behaviour.",8,Big Bang Theory,114,16
37604,Sheldon,3," Yeah, not to be confused with the French Fry Goodness Inventory. That's pure Cooper.",8,Big Bang Theory,85,14
37605,Leonard,3," So, this is accurate?",8,Big Bang Theory,22,4
37606,Sheldon,3," It's been around for 25 years, and has been extensively corroborated by other researchers.",8,Big Bang Theory,91,14
37607,Penny,3," Well, kind of takes the romance out of relationships.",8,Big Bang Theory,54,9
37608,Sheldon,3, Kind of? It does it perfectly.,8,Big Bang Theory,31,6
37609,Amy,3, Sheldon and I got an eight-point-two out of ten.,8,Big Bang Theory,49,9
37610,Leonard,3, Fine. We'll take it right now.,8,Big Bang Theory,31,6
37611,Penny,3," No, don't.",8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
37612,Leonard,3, What?,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
37613,Penny,3, Just don't take it.,8,Big Bang Theory,20,4
37614,Leonard,3, Why not?,8,Big Bang Theory,9,2
37615,Penny,3, â€˜Cause it's stupid. Who cares what number it is?,8,Big Bang Theory,51,9
37616,Leonard,3, Come on. It'll be fun.,8,Big Bang Theory,23,5
37617,Penny,3, I said I don't want you to. I'm getting another drink.,8,Big Bang Theory,55,11
37618,Leonard,3, Sorry.,8,Big Bang Theory,7,1
37619,Amy,3, I'm gonna let you count this as two dates. They're a lot of work.,8,Big Bang Theory,66,14
37622,Raj,3, Yup.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
37623,Howard,3, That was a close one.,8,Big Bang Theory,22,5
37625,Raj,3, Is it too late for him to cancel?,8,Big Bang Theory,34,8
37627,Howard,3, Heads up! Watch out!,8,Big Bang Theory,21,4
37629,Leonard,3, Are you mad at me?,8,Big Bang Theory,19,5
37630,Penny,3," No, stop being stupid.",8,Big Bang Theory,23,4
37631,Leonard,3," Um, whew? Is this about the test, or is this about us?",8,Big Bang Theory,55,12
37632,Penny,3," Look, I don't need a score on a test to make me worry about something I'm already worried about.",8,Big Bang Theory,97,19
37633,Leonard,3, What are you worried about?,8,Big Bang Theory,28,5
37634,Penny,3," That we're engaged and have nothing in common, and it scares me.",8,Big Bang Theory,65,12
37635,Leonard,3," Yeah, that scares me, too.",8,Big Bang Theory,27,5
37636,Penny,3, It does?,8,Big Bang Theory,9,2
37637,Leonard,3, Sometimes.,8,Big Bang Theory,11,1
37638,Penny,3," Well, that's not good. You being blindly infatuated with me was the rock we were building this relationship on.",8,Big Bang Theory,112,19
37639,Leonard,3," Okay, well, this might make you feel better. Uh, we're both scared that our marriage will be a disaster, and so, that's something that we have in common. Also, we both think I'm not funny. Huh? See, you're not laughing.",8,Big Bang Theory,220,40
37642,Howard,3," Hey, Mike. Listen, NASA asked me to throw out the first pitch at an Angels game. You got any advice?",8,Big Bang Theory,101,20
37644,Howard,3, Why shouldn't I do it?,8,Big Bang Theory,23,5
37646,Howard,3, But it's for a good cause. What about all the kids that'll be there?,8,Big Bang Theory,69,14
37648,Howard,3," Well, maybe I'll do a good job.",8,Big Bang Theory,32,7
37650,Howard,3," Okay, thanks for the pep talk.",8,Big Bang Theory,31,6
37654,Penny,3," Hey, sorry about that.",8,Big Bang Theory,23,4
37655,Amy,3," No, we're sorry. We never should have been comparing relationships in the first place.",8,Big Bang Theory,87,14
37656,Sheldon,3," Why? We won. You know, I say, next, we take on Koothrappali and his dog. Really give ourselves a challenge.",8,Big Bang Theory,108,20
37657,Leonard,3, I just want to say one more thing about this. Just because Penny and I are very different people does not mean that we're a bad couple.,8,Big Bang Theory,136,27
37658,Sheldon,3," The answer is one simple test away. Hmm? You know, it's like when I thought there was a possum in my closet. Did I sit around wondering? No, I sent Leonard in with a pointy stick and a bag.",8,Big Bang Theory,190,39
37659,Leonard,3, I killed his Chewbacca slippers.,8,Big Bang Theory,33,5
37660,Penny,3, Let's just take the test.,8,Big Bang Theory,26,5
37661,Leonard,3," No, no, no, I don't want to.",8,Big Bang Theory,29,7
37662,Penny,3," Oh, well, 'cause you know we're gonna do bad.",8,Big Bang Theory,46,9
37663,Leonard,3, Because it doesn't matter. I don't care if we're a ten or a two.,8,Big Bang Theory,65,14
37664,Sheldon,3, Or a one. A one is possible.,8,Big Bang Theory,29,7
37665,Leonard,3," Marriage is scary. You're scared, I'm scared. But it doesn't make me not want to do it. It, it just makes me want to hold your hand and do it with you.",8,Big Bang Theory,152,32
37666,Penny,3, Leonard.,8,Big Bang Theory,9,1
37667,Amy,3, It would make me so happy if you said things like that.,8,Big Bang Theory,56,12
37668,Sheldon,3," We got an eight-point-two. Trust me, you're happy.",8,Big Bang Theory,51,8
37670,Raj,3," Mmm, I love how they put a waterfall at centre field. It really ties the whole stadium together.",8,Big Bang Theory,97,18
37671,Penny,3," Look at you, talking sports.",8,Big Bang Theory,29,5
37672,Leonard,3," This is fun, huh? We get to see our friend throw out the first pitch, have a hot dog, watch the game.",8,Big Bang Theory,102,22
37673,Sheldon,3, Whoa. Nobody said anything about watching the game.,8,Big Bang Theory,52,8
37674,Amy,3," Sheldon, what did you expect?",8,Big Bang Theory,30,5
37675,Sheldon,3," I expected to see Howard throw the baseball, finish my hot dog, and hightail it across the street to Disneyland just in time for Mickey's Soundsational Parade.",8,Big Bang Theory,160,27
37676,Amy,3," I'll tell you what. If we stay, I'll buy you cotton candy and a bobblehead.",8,Big Bang Theory,76,15
37677,Sheldon,3, Who's the bobblehead of?,8,Big Bang Theory,25,4
37678,Amy,3, Does it matter?,8,Big Bang Theory,16,3
37679,Sheldon,3," No, as long as it bobbles.",8,Big Bang Theory,27,6
37681,Howard,3," Thanks. I'm proud of me, too.",8,Big Bang Theory,30,6
37683,Howard,3, Let's do it.,8,Big Bang Theory,13,3
37685,Howard,3, Wish me luck.,8,Big Bang Theory,14,3
37688,Howard,3, Thank you. Thank you.,8,Big Bang Theory,22,4
37689,Penny,3, Can he really throw a ball?,8,Big Bang Theory,28,6
37690,Leonard,3," On our Quidditch team, he",8,Big Bang Theory,26,5
37691,Penny,3," Yeah, that's a no.",8,Big Bang Theory,19,4
37692,Howard,3," I have a message for the young people here today. When I was asked to throw the first pitch, a little voice in my head said I couldn't do it. So, I practiced and practiced, and you know what? That little voice was right, but then I remembered that I'm not an athlete. I'm a scientist. So, today's first pitch will be delivered to home plate by science. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, I present to you a working prototype of the Mars Rover. And here's the wind-up, and the pitch.",8,Big Bang Theory,486,92
37694,Howard,3, â€˜Cause I'm an idiot who didn't think this through.,8,Big Bang Theory,53,9
37695,Sheldon,3," Okay, new plan. We go to Disneyland, play hide and seek on Tom Sawyer's Island, and then come back and see the end of the pitch.",8,Big Bang Theory,129,26
37696,Howard,3," Okay, while we're waiting for the ball to arrive, here's some fun facts about Mars.",8,Big Bang Theory,84,15
37698,Sheldon,3, He makes a valid point.,8,Big Bang Theory,24,5
37699,Howard,3," Okay, booing isn't gonna make it go any faster.",8,Big Bang Theory,48,9
37701,Leonard,4, Have you guys heard about this research team that's trying to transgenically manipulate chicken DNA to create some sort of chicken dinosaur?,8,Big Bang Theory,141,22
37702,Sheldon,4," Oh, I think that sounds wonderful.",8,Big Bang Theory,35,6
37703,Howard,4, What? You're afraid of both dinosaurs and chickens.,8,Big Bang Theory,52,8
37704,Sheldon,4," Yes, but tell me a dinosaur chicken salad sandwich wouldn't hit the Mesozoic spot.",8,Big Bang Theory,83,14
37705,Raj,4," Hey, guys.",8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
37706,Howard,4, Hey.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
37707,Sheldon,4, Hello.,8,Big Bang Theory,7,1
37708,Raj,4, We still on for tomorrow night?,8,Big Bang Theory,32,6
37709,Leonard,4, Yeah. I'm excited to finally meet your girlfriend.,8,Big Bang Theory,51,8
37710,Sheldon,4," Speaking of which, according to a recent study out of Oxford University, when someone takes on a new romantic partner, that person loses one or two close friends.",8,Big Bang Theory,163,28
37711,Howard,4, Since when do you read social science?,8,Big Bang Theory,39,7
37712,Sheldon,4, I go to the bathroom like everybody else.,8,Big Bang Theory,42,8
37713,Raj,4, Why would I lose friends just because I started dating someone?,8,Big Bang Theory,64,11
37714,Leonard,4," Yeah, you didn't lose anyone when you met Amy. Yeah, well, no, this study refers to romantic partners. Not the way I would categorize the two of us.",8,Big Bang Theory,149,28
37715,Raj,4, You guys kiss and hold hands.,8,Big Bang Theory,30,6
37716,Leonard,4, I've seen him do it. It's not romantic.,8,Big Bang Theory,40,8
37717,Raj,4," Look, I'm not the kind of guy who drops his friends just because he's in a relationship.",8,Big Bang Theory,89,17
37718,Leonard,4, What happens if she doesn't like us?,8,Big Bang Theory,37,7
37719,Raj,4," Well, hey, you're my dear friends. You'll get a Christmas card for a couple of years, and then you're dead to me.",8,Big Bang Theory,114,22
37721,Amy,4," So, Howard, is Stuart still living with your mom?",8,Big Bang Theory,50,9
37722,Howard,4, I don't want to talk about it.,8,Big Bang Theory,31,7
37724,Howard,4," My mom got him cable. In my whole life, growing up in that house, no cable. Do you know how many HBOs that leech had my mother get him? Seven. Seven HBOs. Seven.",8,Big Bang Theory,162,33
37726,Raj,4," Hey, guys.",8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
37727,Sheldon,4, Hello.,8,Big Bang Theory,7,1
37728,Raj,4," Emily, you know almost everybody here.",8,Big Bang Theory,39,6
37730,Raj,4," And this is Leonard, this is Penny.",8,Big Bang Theory,36,7
37732,Leonard,4," Nice to finally meet you, too.",8,Big Bang Theory,31,6
37733,Penny,4, Hi.,8,Big Bang Theory,4,1
37735,Leonard,4," Wow, Raj, you were not lying about her.",8,Big Bang Theory,40,8
37736,Raj,4, I told you she exists.,8,Big Bang Theory,23,5
37737,Penny,4," Hey, I hear you're a dermatologist.",8,Big Bang Theory,36,6
37739,Sheldon,4," Oh, I like their emergency room. Yeah, even if it turns out you don't have Dengue fever, they still let you take a lollipop.",8,Big Bang Theory,125,24
37741,Penny,4," Oh, it would be great to practice on a real doctor.",8,Big Bang Theory,52,11
37743,Sheldon,4, I have some odd freckles on my buttocks. Can I make an appointment for you to look at them?,8,Big Bang Theory,92,19
37745,Amy,4," I'm with him three years, nothing. She's with him two minutes, and he's taking his pants off.",8,Big Bang Theory,94,17
37748,Penny,4, I don't know. I kind of got the sense she didn't like me.,8,Big Bang Theory,58,13
37750,Penny,4, Of course not. No one ever says they don't like you straight to your face.,8,Big Bang Theory,75,15
37751,Amy,4, We have led different lives.,8,Big Bang Theory,29,5
37753,Penny,4, It's just this vibe I got.,8,Big Bang Theory,27,6
37755,Penny,4," Yeah. You're probably right. I used to think my high school P.E. teacher didn't like me, but it turned out, she liked me a little too much.",8,Big Bang Theory,140,27
37757,Penny,4," Yeah. It was fine. We went to a Melissa Etheridge concert, I got an A, it all worked out.",8,Big Bang Theory,90,19
37759,Penny,4," Yeah, I hope you're right.",8,Big Bang Theory,27,5
37760,Amy,4, You really went your entire life without anyone saying I hate you to your face?,8,Big Bang Theory,80,15
37761,Penny,4, Yeah.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
37762,Amy,4," I'd say it now, but look at those cheekbones.",8,Big Bang Theory,46,9
37764,Sheldon,4," I miss Stuart's place. All this loud music and exposed brick. What, is this a comic book store, or a rave at the third little pig's house?",8,Big Bang Theory,139,27
37765,Howard,4," Yep, I wish Stuart would reopen. I hate this place, too.",8,Big Bang Theory,57,11
37766,Leonard,4," Okay, him I believe because he's an 80-year-old man in a 15-year-old's tee shirt. But you're just upset about Stuart and your mom and all their HBOs.",8,Big Bang Theory,150,27
37767,Howard,4," Yes, I am. You know, I can't even watch Game of Thrones now without thinking of mother saying, Stuart, which one is Thrones?",8,Big Bang Theory,125,23
37768,Raj,4," You know, he might not reopen. He didn't get a lot of money from the insurance company.",8,Big Bang Theory,88,17
37769,Sheldon,4," Oh, boy, if there is one thing that gets my goat, it's those dad-gum insurance companies.",8,Big Bang Theory,90,16
37770,Leonard,4," Why? Because they won't get off your lawn? Is Stuart trying to get a loan, or, or find investors?",8,Big Bang Theory,98,19
37771,Howard,4," All I know is, he's got my mother buying four-ply toilet paper. I mean, four-ply. If his butt is so delicate, why doesn't he just use an angora rabbit?",8,Big Bang Theory,152,29
37772,Sheldon,4," For starters, they shed and bite.",8,Big Bang Theory,34,6
37773,Leonard,4," Hey, here's a thought. Why don't we put up the rest of the money that Stuart needs?",8,Big Bang Theory,84,17
37774,Raj,4," So, we'd be, like, owners of a comic book store?",8,Big Bang Theory,49,10
37775,Leonard,4, It's kind of a dream come true.,8,Big Bang Theory,32,7
37776,Howard,4, That does sound fun.,8,Big Bang Theory,21,4
37777,Raj,4," Ooh, maybe we could come up with a business plan to compete with this place.",8,Big Bang Theory,77,15
37778,Sheldon,4," I'll give you a plan right now. Step one, open comic book store. Step two, start rumour this comic book store gives you genital warts. Step three, buy a big bag to put the money in.",8,Big Bang Theory,182,36
37779,Leonard,4, It's not that bad.,8,Big Bang Theory,19,4
37781,Penny,4, Hey.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
37783,Penny,4, Thank you so much for letting me practice my sales pitch on you. I really appreciate it.,8,Big Bang Theory,89,17
37785,Penny,4," Um, I brought coffee. I wasn't sure what you like, so I got a regular, a cappuccino and a Chai tea. Since you like Raj, I thought you might be into that.",8,Big Bang Theory,154,32
37787,Penny,4," Oh, yeah, sure. Let me just get out my materials. Leonard gave me this briefcase. He used to carry it around in high school. You can still see the dent where they whacked him with it. Okay, I would like to talk to you about our new birth control pill, Femevra.",8,Big Bang Theory,261,51
37789,Penny,4," So, Femevra's triphasic design provides balanced hormonal exposure.",8,Big Bang Theory,68,8
37791,Penny,4," It has also been shown to cause significantly fewer side effects than other oral contraceptives. Although it can cause acne, which, if you ask me, kind of increases its effectiveness as a contraceptive.",8,Big Bang Theory,203,33
37793,Penny,4," Okay, I'm sorry. Did we get off on the wrong foot? Because since the other night, I kind of feel like you might have a problem with me.",8,Big Bang Theory,136,28
37795,Penny,4," Are you sure, because it doesn't seem fine?",8,Big Bang Theory,44,8
37797,Penny,4," Oh, my God. Tell me, what did I do?",8,Big Bang Theory,36,9
37799,Penny,4," What? Oh, why would he say that?",8,Big Bang Theory,33,7
37801,Penny,4," Well, I wouldn't exactly call it a hook-up.",8,Big Bang Theory,44,8
37803,Penny,4, Yeah.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
37805,Penny,4, Yeah.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
37807,Penny,4, No. Yeah.,8,Big Bang Theory,10,2
37809,Sheldon,4," So, what are some ways we could set our comic book store apart from the competition?",8,Big Bang Theory,85,16
37810,Leonard,4," Oh, kids buy comic books. It would be great to figure out a way to get more kids in the store.",8,Big Bang Theory,95,21
37811,Howard,4," You know, when I was a kid, I loved going there, but I could never get a ride.",8,Big Bang Theory,79,18
37812,Raj,4," Ooh, what if we got a van and drove around and picked kids up?",8,Big Bang Theory,63,14
37813,Sheldon,4," Nice. You mean, like at parks and schools?",8,Big Bang Theory,43,8
37814,Howard,4," Toy stores, puppet shows.",8,Big Bang Theory,26,4
37815,Leonard,4," Hold on. So, your idea is to get a van and cruise the streets looking for kids to pick up?",8,Big Bang Theory,91,20
37816,Sheldon,4, Yes.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
37817,Leonard,4, And are you gonna use candy to lure them in?,8,Big Bang Theory,45,10
37818,Raj,4, We are now.,8,Big Bang Theory,12,3
37819,Penny,4, You told Emily we hooked up?,8,Big Bang Theory,29,6
37820,Raj,4," Um, well, in my defence, I tell everybody.",8,Big Bang Theory,43,8
37821,Penny,4, Why would you say that?,8,Big Bang Theory,24,5
37822,Raj,4, We were having a conversation about past lovers.,8,Big Bang Theory,49,8
37823,Penny,4, We weren't lovers. Come on. Everyone knows we didn't sleep together. We got drunk and fooled around. Why couldn't you just leave me out of it?,8,Big Bang Theory,143,26
37824,Raj,4," Well, we were being honest. You would leave me out of the conversation with the next guy if you dumped Leonard?",8,Big Bang Theory,112,21
37825,Leonard,4, Why say it?,8,Big Bang Theory,12,3
37826,Penny,4, Yes.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
37827,Raj,4," Well, I would never leave you off my list, and not just because, without you, we're playing fast and loose with the word list.",8,Big Bang Theory,127,24
37828,Penny,4," Well, good job. Now she hates me. Ugh.",8,Big Bang Theory,39,8
37829,Raj,4, Great.,8,Big Bang Theory,7,1
37830,Sheldon,4," On the bright side, that Oxford study was right. One friend down. I wonder who you're going to lose next.",8,Big Bang Theory,106,20
37831,Raj,4," You, okay? It's you. You're, you're next.",8,Big Bang Theory,42,7
37832,Sheldon,4, No. You're crazy about me.,8,Big Bang Theory,27,5
37834,Penny,4," I don't know what Emily's so upset about anyway. Even if I had slept with him, so what? Everyone has a past.",8,Big Bang Theory,109,22
37835,Amy,4, Hmm-hmm.,8,Big Bang Theory,9,1
37836,Penny,4, Almost everyone has a past.,8,Big Bang Theory,28,5
37838,Penny,4, It's not.,8,Big Bang Theory,10,2
37840,Penny,4, How? You can't force someone to like you.,8,Big Bang Theory,42,8
37841,Amy,4," What if you just hang around and act like her friend until you wear her down? I mean, next thing you know, you're in her home, you're eating her food, drinking her wine.",8,Big Bang Theory,170,33
37842,Penny,4," No, that won't work.",8,Big Bang Theory,21,4
37843,Amy,4, You're right. Cheers.,8,Big Bang Theory,22,3
37845,Penny,4, What?,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
37847,Penny,4, It's stupid.,8,Big Bang Theory,13,2
37849,Amy,4," I'm gonna go with Penny on this one. Then again, why wouldn't I? I mean, we go way back.",8,Big Bang Theory,89,19
37850,Penny,4," Oh, my God. I didn't used to like you.",8,Big Bang Theory,39,9
37851,Amy,4, Shh. Amy's here now.,8,Big Bang Theory,21,4
37853,Sheldon,4," You know, the more I think about it, the more intrigued I am about having our own store.",8,Big Bang Theory,89,18
37854,Howard,4, We'll get to see all the new stuff before it hits the shelves.,8,Big Bang Theory,63,13
37855,Sheldon,4," And we'll get to have fun interactions with our customers. Like, this isn't a library, buy it or get out.",8,Big Bang Theory,106,20
37856,Howard,4, You say things like that all the time.,8,Big Bang Theory,39,8
37857,Sheldon,4," Yes, but as a store owner, I'll finally have a good comeback to, You don't work here, shut up.",8,Big Bang Theory,95,19
37858,Leonard,4," Uh, do you know how Penny told Raj he should have left her off his list?",8,Big Bang Theory,73,16
37859,Howard,4, Yeah.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
37860,Leonard,4," Well, do you think when she and I had that conversation, she left people off her list?",8,Big Bang Theory,87,17
37861,Sheldon,4, I'm sure she did.,8,Big Bang Theory,18,4
37862,Leonard,4, Why?,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
37863,Sheldon,4," Because if she hadn't, she'd still be wading through the list.",8,Big Bang Theory,63,11
37864,Leonard,4, Will you stay out of this?,8,Big Bang Theory,27,6
37865,Sheldon,4, If only Penny had said that once in a while.,8,Big Bang Theory,45,10
37866,Howard,4," Hey, what difference does it make? You're the one she wants to marry.",8,Big Bang Theory,70,13
37867,Leonard,4, That's true.,8,Big Bang Theory,13,2
37868,Howard,4," Yeah, and I'm not sure that complete honesty is always the best thing for a relationship.",8,Big Bang Theory,90,16
37869,Sheldon,4," Yeah, he's right. Once, in a moment of candour, I told Amy that her hair reminded me of a duck caught in an oil spill. She stormed out. Which was sad, because we were playing Scrabble, and I had all the letters to spell persimmon.",8,Big Bang Theory,231,45
37870,Leonard,4, Why are you even part of this conversation? You don't know anything about women.,8,Big Bang Theory,81,14
37871,Sheldon,4," I know that if I had a wife or a fiancÃ©e, I'd ask her first before I invested money in a comic book store.",8,Big Bang Theory,108,24
37872,Howard,4, He's right.,8,Big Bang Theory,12,2
37873,Sheldon,4," Yeah, well, of course I am. I was also right about her hair. It did everything but quack.",8,Big Bang Theory,90,18
37875,Leonard,4, There's something I wanted to run past you.,8,Big Bang Theory,44,8
37876,Penny,4, What's up?,8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
37877,Leonard,4," Mm, the guys and I were thinking about investing in Stuart's comic book store. Is that okay?",8,Big Bang Theory,93,17
37878,Penny,4, Why are you asking me?,8,Big Bang Theory,23,5
37879,Leonard,4," Well, you know, we're engaged, and it's kind of a big deal financially. It seems like something we should talk about.",8,Big Bang Theory,118,21
37880,Penny,4," Oh. Well, would you consider mounds of credit card debt kind of a big deal financially?",8,Big Bang Theory,88,16
37881,Leonard,4, Yeah.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
37882,Penny,4, Huh.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
37884,Howard,4," Mm. So, me and the guys were talking about this great investment opportunity.",8,Big Bang Theory,78,13
37886,Howard,4, But you didn't hear what it was.,8,Big Bang Theory,33,7
37888,Howard,4," Oh, come on.",8,Big Bang Theory,13,3
37890,Howard,4, It's to help reopen the comic book store.,8,Big Bang Theory,42,8
37892,Howard,4," Well, hear me out.",8,Big Bang Theory,19,4
37894,Howard,4," I know, but all the guys are doing it. We're splitting it four ways, so it's really not that much money.",8,Big Bang Theory,105,21
37896,Howard,4," I get that. I, okay, look, the real reason this is important is, before my dad left me and my mom, he used to take me to the comic book store. It was one of the few things we did together.",8,Big Bang Theory,189,41
37898,Howard,4," Well, I don't like to talk about it.",8,Big Bang Theory,37,8
37900,Howard,4, That's how much buying a comic book store means to me.,8,Big Bang Theory,55,11
37902,Sheldon,4, I'd like your honest opinion on something.,8,Big Bang Theory,43,7
37903,Amy,4, Of course.,8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
37904,Sheldon,4," Now, before I start, I need you to know that I'm very excited about this, and anything you say that isn't enthusiastically supportive will throw our entire relationship into question. So, keep an open mind.",8,Big Bang Theory,207,35
37905,Amy,4," I'm feeling a little backed into a corner, Sheldon.",8,Big Bang Theory,52,9
37906,Sheldon,4," Perfect. Now, I'm considering investing in Stuart's comic book store.",8,Big Bang Theory,70,10
37907,Amy,4," Interesting. Can you see how a grown man, an accomplished scientist, who invests in a store that sells picture books about flying men in colourful underwear might be wasting both his financial and intellectual resources?",8,Big Bang Theory,221,35
37908,Sheldon,4, No.,8,Big Bang Theory,4,1
37909,Amy,4, Then I think it's a terrific idea.,8,Big Bang Theory,35,7
37910,Sheldon,4, Great. Wait till you hear about our van.,8,Big Bang Theory,41,8
37912,Raj,4, Hey.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
37913,Penny,4, Hi.,8,Big Bang Theory,4,1
37914,Raj,4, Thanks for inviting us over.,8,Big Bang Theory,29,5
37915,Penny,4," Oh, thank you for coming.",8,Big Bang Theory,26,5
37917,Penny,4," No, no. No need to apologise.",8,Big Bang Theory,30,6
37918,Raj,4," Excuse me, can I say something? I just love both you guys, and I want you to get along. And when I say love I meant as a friend. And, uh, way too soon, right?",8,Big Bang Theory,159,35
37919,Penny,4," Okay, sit down. Listen, Emily, what happened between me and Raj was a long time ago.",8,Big Bang Theory,85,16
37920,Raj,4," It was, and I may have made it seem like a bigger deal than I should have.",8,Big Bang Theory,75,17
37921,Penny,4," Yeah, and Leonard and I are engaged now, and I'm just hoping we can put this whole thing behind us.",8,Big Bang Theory,100,20
37923,Penny,4," Oh, that's so sweet. I mean, look at you, you are gorgeous.",8,Big Bang Theory,60,12
37924,Raj,4," It's true, you're both gorgeous. Kind of says something about the man who could bed you both. You get why I've been alone most of my adult life.",8,Big Bang Theory,145,28
37927,Howard,4," Well, I don't need a reason, it's my house.",8,Big Bang Theory,44,9
37929,Howard,4, I'm always welcome.,8,Big Bang Theory,20,3
37933,Howard,4, What?,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
37935,Howard,4," Excuse me. Ma, you are cancelling that cheque, and Stuart is not your bubala, I'm your bubala. You can't have more than one bubala.",8,Big Bang Theory,132,24
37938,Raj,4, I'm so glad we could work this all out.,8,Big Bang Theory,40,9
37939,Penny,4," Yeah, me, too.",8,Big Bang Theory,15,3
37941,Penny,4," Oh, we would love that.",8,Big Bang Theory,24,5
37942,Raj,4, Great.,8,Big Bang Theory,7,1
37943,Penny,4," Okay, good night, guys.",8,Big Bang Theory,24,4
37945,Penny,4, Bye.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
37948,Raj,4, I'm really disappointed we're not gonna have our own comic book store.,8,Big Bang Theory,71,12
37949,Leonard,4, I know. I was looking forward to it.,8,Big Bang Theory,37,8
37950,Sheldon,4," It would've been so nice to have a place that was ours, where we could just sit and read comics in peace.",8,Big Bang Theory,106,22
37951,Howard,4, With comfy seats.,8,Big Bang Theory,18,3
37952,Raj,4, And snacks.,8,Big Bang Theory,12,2
37953,Sheldon,4," Well, I guess it was too good to be true.",8,Big Bang Theory,42,10
37954,Leonard,4, Yeah.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
37956,Raj,5," Hey, I read that someone invented a way to convert your footsteps into electromagnetic energy so you can charge your cell phone while walking.",8,Big Bang Theory,143,24
37957,Leonard,5, We had that idea years ago. How come we never did anything with it?,8,Big Bang Theory,68,14
37958,Howard,5," Probably because we left the diagram of it in the restaurant, and none of us wanted to walk back.",8,Big Bang Theory,98,19
37959,Sheldon,5," I know the real reason you never made progress with that idea. You thought of it September 22nd, 2007. Two days later, Penny moved in, and so much blood rushed to your genitals, your brain became a ghost town.",8,Big Bang Theory,210,39
37960,Leonard,5, That's not what happened.,8,Big Bang Theory,26,4
37961,Sheldon,5, I remember it distinctly because I had just composed my annual poem commemorating the anniversary of Dr. Seuss's death.,8,Big Bang Theory,120,19
37962,Howard,5, No one wants to hear it.,8,Big Bang Theory,25,6
37963,Sheldon,5," Why, die. Why did he die? Old, told. I was told he was old.",8,Big Bang Theory,60,14
37964,Leonard,5, Penny is not the reason I didn't pursue that idea.,8,Big Bang Theory,51,10
37965,Sheldon,5," Oh, really? Since meeting her, what have been your greatest accomplishments?",8,Big Bang Theory,77,11
37966,Raj,5, Easy. Sleeping with Penny.,8,Big Bang Theory,27,4
37967,Howard,5, Getting Penny to go back out with him after she dumped him.,8,Big Bang Theory,60,12
37968,Raj,5, Tricking Penny into getting engaged.,8,Big Bang Theory,37,5
37969,Howard,5," And a few weeks ago, he almost did a pull-up.",8,Big Bang Theory,46,10
37970,Leonard,5, I think someone owes me an apology.,8,Big Bang Theory,36,7
37971,Sheldon,5," Well, don't feel bad. I think we've all been distracted since the girls entered our lives.",8,Big Bang Theory,91,16
37972,Howard,5, You admit Amy's a distraction?,8,Big Bang Theory,31,5
37973,Sheldon,5," Oh, very much so. Listen to this. This is from two days ago. Hi. Hope you're having a good day. Who has time for this constant sexting?",8,Big Bang Theory,136,27
37974,Leonard,5," Well, maybe we have lost our focus.",8,Big Bang Theory,36,7
37975,Howard,5, It wouldn't kill us to get together and brainstorm ideas.,8,Big Bang Theory,58,10
37976,Raj,5," Ooh, we could have one of those retreats.",8,Big Bang Theory,42,8
37977,Howard,5, My cousin has a cabin out in the woods.,8,Big Bang Theory,40,9
37978,Sheldon,5, I'm not going to a cabin in the woods. Did you see the movie Cabin in the Woods?,8,Big Bang Theory,81,18
37979,Leonard,5, Then we'll go to a hotel.,8,Big Bang Theory,26,6
37980,Sheldon,5, A hotel? Did you see The Shining?,8,Big Bang Theory,34,7
37981,Raj,5, We could go up to Big Bear and get a house on the lake.,8,Big Bang Theory,56,14
37982,Sheldon,5, Did you see The Lake House?,8,Big Bang Theory,28,6
37983,Raj,5, Nothing bad happens in The Lake House.,8,Big Bang Theory,39,7
37984,Sheldon,5," Yeah, well, no, not to them. To me. Time traveling mailbox. The only time that traveled was an hour and half of my life down the toilet.",8,Big Bang Theory,137,27
37985,Leonard,5, Fine. Then we'll just stay here and do it.,8,Big Bang Theory,43,9
37986,Sheldon,5," Well, you didn't suggest a beach house.",8,Big Bang Theory,40,7
37987,Leonard,5, You would go to a beach house?,8,Big Bang Theory,31,7
37988,Sheldon,5," Well, good Lord, no, have you seen Jaws?",8,Big Bang Theory,41,8
37990,Penny,5, Hey.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
37991,Leonard,5," Hey. So, the guys and I are talking about having kind of a science retreat this weekend. I just wanted to know if that's okay. You and I had talked about going to brunch on Sunday.",8,Big Bang Theory,181,36
37992,Penny,5, Want to go to Vegas this weekend?,8,Big Bang Theory,34,7
37993,Amy,5, Of course I do.,8,Big Bang Theory,16,4
37994,Penny,5, Bernadette? Girl's weekend. Vegas. You in?,8,Big Bang Theory,43,6
37996,Penny,5, Yes. I'll check flights.,8,Big Bang Theory,25,4
37998,Amy,5," I'll check my underpants. I'm so excited, I think I peed.",8,Big Bang Theory,58,11
37999,Leonard,5, They seem okay with it.,8,Big Bang Theory,24,5
38001,Raj,5, Hey.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
38002,Leonard,5, Hey.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
38003,Howard,5, Hey. I didn't think you'd make it.,8,Big Bang Theory,35,7
38004,Raj,5, Why not?,8,Big Bang Theory,9,2
38005,Howard,5," Well, 'cause you have a steady girlfriend now, and we assumed you'd have to stay home to lower the food down to her in the pit.",8,Big Bang Theory,128,26
38006,Raj,5," For your information, Emily is working tonight.",8,Big Bang Theory,48,7
38007,Sheldon,5," Yeah, one would assume, on getting out of the pit.",8,Big Bang Theory,51,10
38008,Leonard,5," Okay, let's focus. The girls are gone, we have 48 hours. There are no distractions. Let's change the world.",8,Big Bang Theory,108,19
38009,Sheldon,5, Thinking caps on.,8,Big Bang Theory,18,3
38010,Howard,5, Here we go.,8,Big Bang Theory,12,3
38011,Raj,5," Ooh, this is exciting. We're innovating. I feel like we're in the Facebook movie.",8,Big Bang Theory,82,14
38012,Howard,5, Oh. I never saw that.,8,Big Bang Theory,22,5
38013,Sheldon,5, Really?,8,Big Bang Theory,8,1
38014,Raj,5," Oh. It's wonderful, and I swear I'm not saying that because Justin Timberlake is in it.",8,Big Bang Theory,88,16
38015,Sheldon,5," Yeah, I have it on Blu-ray. We should watch it.",8,Big Bang Theory,48,10
38016,Raj,5, Cool. I'll make the popcorn.,8,Big Bang Theory,29,5
38017,Leonard,5," Guys, in 30 seconds, we went from let's change the world to let's watch TV.",8,Big Bang Theory,76,15
38018,Sheldon,5, I'm sorry. Is that a no?,8,Big Bang Theory,25,6
38019,Howard,5, Okay. No. Leonard's right. We're here to focus. Didn't we used to have a list of all our ideas?,8,Big Bang Theory,96,19
38020,Leonard,5," I, I think I still have it.",8,Big Bang Theory,28,7
38021,Sheldon,5, I did not get a clear answer. I'm gonna set this down now.,8,Big Bang Theory,59,13
38022,Leonard,5," Ah, here it is. Whoa. I haven't looked at these in years. Robot girlfriend.",8,Big Bang Theory,76,14
38023,Howard,5," Mm, that was mine.",8,Big Bang Theory,19,4
38024,Leonard,5, Robot prostitute.,8,Big Bang Theory,18,2
38025,Howard,5, Also mine.,8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
38026,Sheldon,5, Wait. I'm confused. Why would you need both a robot girlfriend and a robot prostitute?,8,Big Bang Theory,87,15
38027,Howard,5, There's just some things you don't do with your robot girlfriend.,8,Big Bang Theory,66,11
38028,Raj,5," Boy, when you met Bernadette, the field of robotics really took a hit.",8,Big Bang Theory,71,13
38029,Leonard,5," Okay, let's just skip all the inventions you can have sex with. All right, no, here we go, ergonomic heated seat cushion.",8,Big Bang Theory,122,22
38030,Howard,5," No, it vibrates. Keep going.",8,Big Bang Theory,29,5
38031,Leonard,5," You know, let's just come up with something new.",8,Big Bang Theory,49,9
38032,Sheldon,5," You know, a number of significant innovations have been inspired by science fiction. The, the geosynchronous satellite from Arthur C. Clarke. The Motorola flip phone, that came from Star Trek. And I've long suspected that the idea of an African-American president was stolen from the movie Deep Impact.",8,Big Bang Theory,303,48
38033,Raj,5," Hey, the future they show in Back to the Future II is only a year away. A lot of the things in that movie haven't been invented yet.",8,Big Bang Theory,133,28
38034,Leonard,5, How cool would that be if we could make one of those a reality?,8,Big Bang Theory,64,14
38035,Sheldon,5," If we could figure out the scientific basis for Marty's hover board, that would have universal application.",8,Big Bang Theory,108,17
38036,Leonard,5," Well, it's, it's possible at absolute zero, but we would have to remove the temperature restrictions.",8,Big Bang Theory,102,16
38037,Raj,5," Oh, I have an idea.",8,Big Bang Theory,20,5
38038,Sheldon,5, I think I have the same one.,8,Big Bang Theory,29,7
38039,Howard,5, We got to watch Back to the Future II.,8,Big Bang Theory,39,9
38040,Raj,5, I'll make the popcorn.,8,Big Bang Theory,23,4
38042,Penny,5," So, where should we go first?",8,Big Bang Theory,30,6
38043,Amy,5, Ooh. There's a cover band in the lounge.,8,Big Bang Theory,41,8
38044,Penny,5, Nah.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
38045,Amy,5, But they play Barry Manilow.,8,Big Bang Theory,29,5
38046,Penny,5, No.,8,Big Bang Theory,4,1
38047,Amy,5, But they're called Fairly Manilow.,8,Big Bang Theory,35,5
38048,Penny,5, Oh. Okay.,8,Big Bang Theory,10,2
38049,Amy,5, Great.,8,Big Bang Theory,7,1
38050,Penny,5, No.,8,Big Bang Theory,4,1
38052,Penny,5," Well, we're in Vegas. I want to go downstairs, get a bucket of margaritas, dance until I vomit all over a roulette wheel and watch it go everywhere.",8,Big Bang Theory,149,28
38053,Amy,5, What if we don't want to vomit?,8,Big Bang Theory,32,7
38054,Penny,5," Oh, you will. That's why they give you the bucket. Uh-oh.",8,Big Bang Theory,58,11
38055,Amy,5, What?,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
38056,Penny,5, It's my boss. They moved my field ride up to Monday.,8,Big Bang Theory,53,11
38057,Amy,5, What does that mean?,8,Big Bang Theory,21,4
38058,Penny,5," It means instead of having a week to study, I only have two days.",8,Big Bang Theory,66,14
38060,Amy,5, Can you start in the morning?,8,Big Bang Theory,30,6
38061,Penny,5," Uh, it's kind of a lot. You know, let me do a little tonight, and I'll catch up with you guys later.",8,Big Bang Theory,101,22
38063,Penny,5," Yeah, it's okay. Go ahead.",8,Big Bang Theory,27,5
38064,Amy,5," So, um, now that Penny's not coming",8,Big Bang Theory,36,7
38066,Amy,5, Okay.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
38068,Howard,5," Hold on. Pause. Something doesn't make sense. Look, in 2015, Biff steals the sports almanac and takes the time machine back to 1955, to give it to his younger self. But as soon as he does that, he changes the future, so the 2015 he returns to would be a different 2015, not the 2015 that Marty and Doc were in.",8,Big Bang Theory,311,61
38070,Sheldon,5," Wait. Whoa, whoa. Is placed right?",8,Big Bang Theory,35,6
38071,Leonard,5, What do you mean?,8,Big Bang Theory,18,4
38072,Sheldon,5, Is placed the right tense for something that would have happened in the future of a past that was affected by something from the future?,8,Big Bang Theory,137,25
38073,Leonard,5, Had will have placed?,8,Big Bang Theory,22,4
38074,Sheldon,5, That's my boy.,8,Big Bang Theory,15,3
38075,Leonard,5," Okay, so, it wasn't until his 21st birthday that Biff had will have placed his first bet and made his millions. That's when he altered the timeline.",8,Big Bang Theory,149,27
38076,Sheldon,5," Yeah, but he had will haven't placed it!",8,Big Bang Theory,41,8
38077,Howard,5, What?,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
38078,Sheldon,5," Unlike Hot Tub Time Machine, this couldn't be more simple. When Biff gets the almanac in 1955, the alternate future he creates isn't the one in which Marty and Doc Brown ever use the time machine to travel to 2015. Therefore, in the new timeline, Marty and Doc never brought the time machine",8,Big Bang Theory,292,53
38079,Leonard,5, Wait. Is brought right?,8,Big Bang Theory,24,4
38080,Sheldon,5, Marty and Doc never had have had brought?,8,Big Bang Theory,42,8
38081,Leonard,5, I don't know. You did it to me.,8,Big Bang Theory,32,8
38082,Sheldon,5," Oh, I'm going with it. Marty and Doc never had have had brought the time machine to 2015. That means 2015 Biff could also not had have had brought the almanac to 1955 Biff. Therefore, the timeline in which 1955 Biff gets the almanac is also the timeline in which 1955 Biff never gets the almanac. And not just never gets. Never have, never hasn't, never had have hasn't.",8,Big Bang Theory,371,69
38083,Raj,5," He's right. Also, what kind of name is Biff? Sounds like when you pop open a can of Pillsbury dough. Biff.",8,Big Bang Theory,107,21
38084,Howard,5," Oh, that stuff is so good wrapped around cocktail weenies.",8,Big Bang Theory,59,10
38085,Leonard,5, Guys.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
38086,Sheldon,5," Do you know that the word wiener comes from the German name of the Austrian capital Vienna, or Wien?",8,Big Bang Theory,101,19
38087,Raj,5, Do you know if you look at Austria on a map it actually looks like a wiener?,8,Big Bang Theory,77,17
38088,Leonard,5," Guys, what are we doing? We sent the girls away so we could focus.",8,Big Bang Theory,67,14
38089,Sheldon,5, I don't think it worked.,8,Big Bang Theory,25,5
38091,Amy,5," Maybe after this, you'll be in the mood for some Manilow.",8,Big Bang Theory,58,11
38093,Amy,5," Look at us out, while Penny's in the room studying.",8,Big Bang Theory,52,10
38095,Amy,5, It is. But enough about Penny. Let's talk about us. We're looking good.,8,Big Bang Theory,72,13
38097,Amy,5," Better than good. I mean, look at you. Your body's bangin'.",8,Big Bang Theory,60,11
38099,Amy,5," Don't Amy me. We're always talking about how hot Penny is. Come on, scientist to scientist, how big are those Hadron Colliders?",8,Big Bang Theory,128,22
38101,Amy,5," Oh, don't be embarrassed. I'll show you the divot in my spine.",8,Big Bang Theory,63,12
38103,Amy,5," No, no, it's okay. I was born with it. If you put a double-A battery in there, it makes my leg kick.",8,Big Bang Theory,101,22
38105,Leonard,5, All right.,8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
38106,Sheldon,5," Oh, this is already better. There are far fewer distractions in here.",8,Big Bang Theory,70,12
38107,Raj,5," Plus, this is where our minds are conditioned to focus on work.",8,Big Bang Theory,64,12
38108,Leonard,5," So, I've been thinking about the hover boards, and maybe there's a way we could use Maglev technology.",8,Big Bang Theory,103,18
38109,Howard,5," Or if we could figure out a way to supercool the materials, we could utilize quantum coupling.",8,Big Bang Theory,95,17
38110,Sheldon,5," Well, I wonder if anyone's tried that.",8,Big Bang Theory,39,7
38111,Raj,5, Go online and look it up.,8,Big Bang Theory,26,6
38112,Howard,5," Oh, I can't argue with him. It's right there on the screen. Austria does look like a wiener.",8,Big Bang Theory,93,18
38113,Raj,5," That's nothing, dude. Go check out how hung Florida is.",8,Big Bang Theory,56,10
38114,Leonard,5, I'm sure Mrs. Florida's walking funny. Can we get back to work?,8,Big Bang Theory,64,12
38115,Sheldon,5," Yeah, he's right. Oh, here's a thought. What if we use some form of operant conditioning techniques to keep us from getting off topic?",8,Big Bang Theory,135,24
38116,Howard,5, Like behavior modification?,8,Big Bang Theory,28,3
38117,Sheldon,5," Yeah, exactly. Did you know those techniques were used to actually teach pigeons to play ping-pong?",8,Big Bang Theory,100,16
38118,Raj,5, That cannot be true.,8,Big Bang Theory,21,4
38119,Raj,5," Hey, it was match point.",8,Big Bang Theory,25,5
38120,Leonard,5, Some psychologists perform operant conditioning with punishment. Maybe we can come up with a punishment for straying off topic.,8,Big Bang Theory,128,19
38121,Raj,5, Not getting to see who wins at pigeon ping-pong comes to mind.,8,Big Bang Theory,63,12
38122,Howard,5, We could snap a rubber band on our wrists every time we get sidetracked.,8,Big Bang Theory,73,14
38123,Sheldon,5," Mmm, not bad. You know, in medieval times, idle chatter was punished with a device called the scold's bridle. It's an iron cage that's locked around the head and pierces the tongue.",8,Big Bang Theory,182,32
38124,Leonard,5, If only we had one.,8,Big Bang Theory,20,5
38125,Sheldon,5," Oh, I'll check Amazon.",8,Big Bang Theory,23,4
38128,Amy,5, We had a complaint about somebody pooping on a party in there.,8,Big Bang Theory,63,12
38130,Amy,5, Why'd you tell her? It was working.,8,Big Bang Theory,36,7
38132,Penny,5, Yeah.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
38134,Penny,5, You guys look like you're having fun.,8,Big Bang Theory,38,7
38135,Amy,5, We're having the best time.,8,Big Bang Theory,28,5
38137,Penny,5, That's a dollar.,8,Big Bang Theory,17,3
38139,Amy,5," Hey, Penny, hey, let's go. We found a place that has Australian male strippers.",8,Big Bang Theory,80,14
38141,Penny,5, That sounds so great. But I have a little more studying to do.,8,Big Bang Theory,63,13
38142,Amy,5, Can you believe this nerd?,8,Big Bang Theory,27,5
38144,Penny,5," All right, guys, look, I would love to go out, but I've got to get this done, okay? So have fun at the club. And if you get in trouble, find a policeman. And if he's taking off his pants, he is not a real policeman.",8,Big Bang Theory,216,46
38145,Amy,5," Okay, okay, this is obviously very important to her. Let's just, we'll help her study so she can get done quicker. Here, here, I'm gonna quiz you. I'm gonna quiz you. I got your notes. I got your notes. I got your notes. If you want these, they're gonna be at the strip club.",8,Big Bang Theory,276,54
38147,Penny,5, To the walk-in closet? Sure.,8,Big Bang Theory,29,5
38149,Leonard,5," Okay, so we agree, whenever someone takes us off topic they get their arm hair yanked off.",8,Big Bang Theory,91,17
38150,Raj,5, And I really can't let that happen or the girl who does my eyebrows will think I've been cheating on her.,8,Big Bang Theory,106,21
38151,Leonard,5," All right, now, one benefit of quantum coupling",8,Big Bang Theory,48,8
38152,Sheldon,5," Wait, a question, who decides if someone's gone off topic?",8,Big Bang Theory,59,10
38153,Leonard,5," I think it'll be pretty clear. If not, we'll take a vote. Oh, and also",8,Big Bang Theory,71,15
38154,Sheldon,5, Ow. We didn't vote!,8,Big Bang Theory,20,4
38155,Leonard,5," We didn't have to, that was clearly a tangent. Now come on. Back to work. If we're leaning towards quantum coupling Aah! Why?",8,Big Bang Theory,126,23
38156,Sheldon,5, You said quantum coupling. That made me think of the show Quantum Leap. That's a tangent and it's your fault.,8,Big Bang Theory,110,20
38157,Howard,5," That's ridiculous. Sheldon, I vote that is not a tangent.",8,Big Bang Theory,58,10
38158,Leonard,5, Thank you. And now I owe you one.,8,Big Bang Theory,34,8
38159,Sheldon,5, Ow. That was your fault.,8,Big Bang Theory,25,5
38160,Howard,5, Hey.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
38161,Raj,5," Ooh, that is a lot of hair. Ow. And now I'm gonna hear it from Jenny.",8,Big Bang Theory,70,16
38162,Leonard,5, Everyone stop. This was a stupid idea. Negative reinforcement isn't working.,8,Big Bang Theory,77,11
38163,Sheldon,5, I think you mean positive punishment. Negative reinforcement is the removal of a positive stimulus. It's a common mistake.,8,Big Bang Theory,123,19
38164,Howard,5, Negative reinforcement is really wrong?,8,Big Bang Theory,40,5
38165,Sheldon,5," Oh, it's used incorrectly all the time. Even Bill Murray makes that mistake in the first scene of Ghostbusters.",8,Big Bang Theory,112,19
38166,Raj,5, No way. Not Bill Murray.,8,Big Bang Theory,25,5
38168,Raj,5, Huh. Bill Murray did get it wrong.,8,Big Bang Theory,35,7
38169,Howard,5, Jump ahead to the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.,8,Big Bang Theory,45,8
38170,Leonard,5, No.,8,Big Bang Theory,4,1
38171,Sheldon,5, Leonard's right. We can't just jump ahead. We have to watch the whole movie.,8,Big Bang Theory,77,14
38172,Leonard,5," Look. We keep procrastinating. We saw Back to the Future II, pigeons playing ping-pong, a bunch of countries that look like genitals and one guy whose genitals look like Denmark.",8,Big Bang Theory,179,30
38173,Raj,5," Yeah, sorry for clicking on that.",8,Big Bang Theory,34,6
38174,Leonard,5, It's late. We've wasted hours. Can we please find it in ourselves to do any amount of work tonight?,8,Big Bang Theory,100,19
38175,Sheldon,5, But we didn't see them bust one ghost.,8,Big Bang Theory,39,8
38176,Leonard,5," So you're, you're saying we should stand here in my lab on a Saturday night and watch the rest of Ghostbusters on a crappy laptop?",8,Big Bang Theory,131,25
38177,Sheldon,5, No.,8,Big Bang Theory,4,1
38180,Leonard,5, It really does hold up.,8,Big Bang Theory,24,5
38183,Penny,5, Yep. Shake that thing.,8,Big Bang Theory,23,4
38185,Amy,5," We had some pretty hot corpses in my anatomy class, but none of them moved like that.",8,Big Bang Theory,86,17
38187,Penny,5," Good morning. You want to go to the pool? Come on, you said it yourself, only nerds and losers stay in the room. Wow, it's bright out. Isn't it bright? I should probably close these curtains. Nah. Bye.",8,Big Bang Theory,202,38
38189,Amy,5, Okay.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
38192,Penny,6," Oh, thanks. Got a couple new outfits for work.",8,Big Bang Theory,47,9
38193,Howard,6," How does it feel knowing your fiancÃ©e's job is to go out and flirt with doctors, looking like that, while you sit here, you know, looking like this?",8,Big Bang Theory,150,28
38194,Leonard,6, She doesn't flirt with doctors.,8,Big Bang Theory,32,5
38195,Penny,6, Yeah. It's all very professional.,8,Big Bang Theory,34,5
38196,Amy,6," You know when you bend over, I can see down your shirt?",8,Big Bang Theory,56,12
38197,Penny,6," Okay, good.",8,Big Bang Theory,12,2
38199,Sheldon,6," Oh, yeah, I'd have to say it's the most exiting time in the history of the field.",8,Big Bang Theory,82,17
38201,Sheldon,6, I started doing it.,8,Big Bang Theory,20,4
38202,Raj,6," You know, the government funded the biggest experiment yet to detect dark matter.",8,Big Bang Theory,82,13
38203,Leonard,6," Yeah, I've read about that, they're sending research teams down into abandoned salt mines.",8,Big Bang Theory,91,14
38204,Raj,6," You know, Sheldon, if we apply to be one of those teams, we could be on the ground floor of something big, not just for theoretical physics but for astrophysics as well.",8,Big Bang Theory,170,32
38205,Penny,6," Wait, hang on, you guys are gonna work in a mine?",8,Big Bang Theory,50,11
38206,Sheldon,6, Why not?,8,Big Bang Theory,9,2
38207,Penny,6, You had a panic attack when we went through the car wash.,8,Big Bang Theory,58,12
38208,Sheldon,6, Perhaps the emotion you're referring to was shock at you having something cleaned.,8,Big Bang Theory,83,13
38209,Leonard,6," I think what Penny meant is, the thought of you two in a mine is kind of funny, it's like a cat riding a Roomba.",8,Big Bang Theory,113,25
38210,Howard,6,"If they get scared, they'll have those hats with the lights on them, 'cause down there it's night-night all the time.",8,Big Bang Theory,117,21
38212,Leonard,6," Yeah, it'll help them get away when they see a g-g-ghost.",8,Big Bang Theory,58,11
38213,Sheldon,6,Are they making fun of us?,8,Big Bang Theory,26,6
38214,Raj,6, Yup.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
38215,Sheldon,6, I miss the old days when I couldn't tell.,8,Big Bang Theory,42,9
38217,Leonard,6," So, one of my favourite video games of all time is called Shadow of the Colossus, and it was only for PlayStation 2, but then they came out with a new version for PS3 with better graphics. I finally got the chance to play it, and for some reason, it just wasn't as good as the first one. Or something about yoga.",8,Big Bang Theory,313,62
38218,Penny,6," I'm sorry, I was thinking about work.",8,Big Bang Theory,38,7
38219,Leonard,6," Well, I was just saying that there was this video game",8,Big Bang Theory,55,11
38220,Penny,6," Yeah, that's when I started thinking about work. Uh, listen, I've got some good news.",8,Big Bang Theory,86,15
38221,Leonard,6, Hmm.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
38222,Penny,6, This is for you.,8,Big Bang Theory,17,4
38223,Leonard,6, Huh. What is this?,8,Big Bang Theory,19,4
38224,Penny,6," Well, you know how they gave me the company car? Didn't make sense to have two, so I sold the other one.",8,Big Bang Theory,105,22
38225,Leonard,6, The one I gave you?,8,Big Bang Theory,20,5
38226,Penny,6," Yeah. And there's your money back, and now we're even. How great is that?",8,Big Bang Theory,74,14
38227,Leonard,6," Uh, yeah.",8,Big Bang Theory,10,2
38228,Penny,6, What?,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
38229,Leonard,6, Nothing.,8,Big Bang Theory,9,1
38230,Penny,6," Oh, come on, Leonard, I know the car was a thoughtful gesture and I really appreciate it, but it doesn't make sense to have both.",8,Big Bang Theory,130,25
38231,Leonard,6, You're right.,8,Big Bang Theory,14,2
38232,Penny,6, What should I have done? Taken a picture of us in the car and put it in a pink frame with puffy paint around it that says best fiancÃ© ever?,8,Big Bang Theory,141,30
38233,Leonard,6, Doesn't sound that bad.,8,Big Bang Theory,24,4
38234,Penny,6," Well, good, because that's what I did.",8,Big Bang Theory,39,7
38235,Leonard,6," Aw, oh, thank you. That is so sweet.",8,Big Bang Theory,37,8
38236,Penny,6," Well, it's not that sweet, I paid for the frame with your money and then got a massage.",8,Big Bang Theory,88,18
38237,Leonard,6," You know what, you don't have to give me this. You keep it.",8,Big Bang Theory,60,13
38238,Penny,6, Why?,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
38239,Leonard,6," The car was a gift, it was something you needed. I was happy to help you out.",8,Big Bang Theory,78,17
38240,Penny,6," And I really appreciate it, but now I don't need it, so here you go.",8,Big Bang Theory,69,15
38241,Leonard,6," Well, this is silly, so you don't need the car, but you could use it to buy yourself something else, like a new purse to put all this money in.",8,Big Bang Theory,144,30
38242,Penny,6," Sweetie, I can buy my own stuff. I have a good job now.",8,Big Bang Theory,56,13
38243,Leonard,6," I know, and I'm proud of you, but that doesn't mean I can't do something nice. Like this.",8,Big Bang Theory,90,18
38244,Penny,6," Okay, I don't want this to turn into a fight.",8,Big Bang Theory,46,10
38245,Leonard,6," I don't, either.",8,Big Bang Theory,17,3
38246,Penny,6," Great. Thank you. Can you pass the salt, please?",8,Big Bang Theory,49,9
38247,Leonard,6," Sure. In my mind, that broke the tension with comedy and led to sex.",8,Big Bang Theory,69,14
38249,Raj,6," Hey, Sheldon, you busy?",8,Big Bang Theory,24,4
38250,Sheldon,6," I'm always busy. This mind is capable of advanced multitasking. You know, currently, I'm attempting to solve the Penrose conjecture, I'm composing my Nobel acceptance speech for when I've solved the Penrose conjecture, and I'm wondering how mermaids have babies.",8,Big Bang Theory,263,40
38251,Raj,6, Don't they lay eggs on a rock?,8,Big Bang Theory,31,7
38252,Sheldon,6, Now I've got room for another thing. What do you want?,8,Big Bang Theory,55,11
38253,Raj,6," So, I did a little research on what the conditions are like in the mines, and the guys might be right, sounds pretty rough down there. For starters, it's very humid, and about a hundred degrees.",8,Big Bang Theory,195,36
38254,Sheldon,6," Well, I'm from Texas and you're from India, we're no strangers to the fragrant armpit. Next.",8,Big Bang Theory,93,16
38255,Raj,6," It's also a live mine, so there'll be dynamite explosions going off in the distance.",8,Big Bang Theory,85,15
38256,Sheldon,6," Yeah, I have a lactose intolerant roommate with a taste for ice cream. Next.",8,Big Bang Theory,77,14
38257,Raj,6," Oh, you have to be down there for 12 hours at a time.",8,Big Bang Theory,54,13
38258,Sheldon,6, Yeah? We have to be somewhere.,8,Big Bang Theory,31,6
38259,Raj,6," Well, there's no toilets, we'll have to do our business in a bucket.",8,Big Bang Theory,69,13
38260,Sheldon,6," So it's settled, we're not doing it.",8,Big Bang Theory,37,7
38261,Raj,6," Look, I get it, but before we pass up on an incredible opportunity, I was thinking about when Howard was training to go to space, they put him in a simulated environment.",8,Big Bang Theory,171,32
38262,Sheldon,6, Interesting. You're suggesting that we recreate the conditions of the mine to see if we can handle it.,8,Big Bang Theory,103,18
38263,Raj,6, Exactly.,8,Big Bang Theory,9,1
38264,Sheldon,6, Very well.,8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
38265,Raj,6, So where should we do it?,8,Big Bang Theory,26,6
38266,Sheldon,6," Well, I'll just Google hot, dark and moist, see what comes up.",8,Big Bang Theory,63,12
38267,Raj,6," Uh, Sheldon",8,Big Bang Theory,12,2
38268,Sheldon,6," Oh, there, well, look, there's all kinds of videos.",8,Big Bang Theory,52,9
38270,Leonard,6," Hey, you got a sec?",8,Big Bang Theory,20,5
38271,Penny,6, Hi. Sure.,8,Big Bang Theory,10,2
38272,Leonard,6, I was hoping we could talk about the money again.,8,Big Bang Theory,50,10
38273,Penny,6," Oh, sweetie, just forget about it.",8,Big Bang Theory,35,6
38274,Leonard,6," No, no, no, no, hear me out. I know things got a little weird last night.",8,Big Bang Theory,74,16
38275,Penny,6," Well, leaving an envelope full of cash on my dresser after sex would count as weird.",8,Big Bang Theory,85,16
38276,Leonard,6," Well, I think I came up with a pretty good solution.",8,Big Bang Theory,53,11
38277,Penny,6, Mm.,8,Big Bang Theory,4,1
38278,Leonard,6," Why don't we just put the money in a joint account? It'll be our first money together. We can use it for the wedding, the honeymoon, whatever.",8,Big Bang Theory,143,27
38279,Penny,6," You know what, that's great. I love that.",8,Big Bang Theory,42,8
38280,Leonard,6," Yeah, of course you do, I'm not just a genius in bed. You sure are, baby.",8,Big Bang Theory,74,16
38281,Penny,6, You two want to be alone?,8,Big Bang Theory,26,6
38282,Leonard,6," I want you to know I get why you don't want the money, you've got this new job, you're excited about being financially independent, and I am nothing but proud of you.",8,Big Bang Theory,167,32
38283,Penny,6," Oh, thank you so much. It feels so good to hear you say that. And I want you to know that I get this job kind of changes the balance in our relationship, and I'm trying to be sensitive to that.",8,Big Bang Theory,194,41
38284,Leonard,6, What?,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
38285,Penny,6," Well, I just think that maybe you're a little hung up on the money because I'm less reliant on you now, and that's a little scary.",8,Big Bang Theory,131,26
38286,Leonard,6, Hmm. Maybe. Or maybe I tried to do something nice and maybe you had a problem with it because of your control issues.,8,Big Bang Theory,118,23
38287,Penny,6, Control issues?,8,Big Bang Theory,16,2
38288,Leonard,6, Maybe.,8,Big Bang Theory,7,1
38289,Penny,6," Or, maybe now that I'm no longer an out-of-work actress who can't pay for her own dinner, that makes you a little insecure.",8,Big Bang Theory,124,23
38290,Leonard,6," Well, I can't believe you'd say that. You know how insecure I am about my insecurities.",8,Big Bang Theory,88,16
38291,Penny,6, You know what? I'm sorry. It's stupid to fight over money.,8,Big Bang Theory,59,11
38292,Leonard,6," Yeah, I'm sorry, too. We're about to share the rest of our lives together. It's our money, who cares who has it?",8,Big Bang Theory,113,22
38293,Penny,6," Ugh, You're right, who cares? Mm. Get that money out of my back pocket or I will break your fingers.",8,Big Bang Theory,101,20
38295,Raj,6, Huh. All this time I never knew there were steam tunnels down here.,8,Big Bang Theory,68,13
38296,Amy,6," Most universities have them. When I was an undergrad, I spent three days in one pledging a sorority.",8,Big Bang Theory,101,18
38297,Raj,6, Did you get in?,8,Big Bang Theory,16,4
38298,Amy,6, No. They forgot I was there. But it really opened up my pores.,8,Big Bang Theory,63,13
38299,Sheldon,6," Well, according to my research, the steam tunnels below this access point should be the closest analog to the mines.",8,Big Bang Theory,117,20
38300,Raj,6, This is gonna be so much more accurate than the steam room at the gym.,8,Big Bang Theory,71,15
38301,Sheldon,6," Plus, there's almost no chance we'll see any of our coworkers half naked.",8,Big Bang Theory,74,13
38302,Raj,6," Or totally naked. I love Howard, but the dude needs a little shame.",8,Big Bang Theory,68,13
38303,Sheldon,6," All right, Amy, this walkie-talkie is yours. If we run into any problems, I'll contact you. And if anything bad happens, what's the rule?",8,Big Bang Theory,138,24
38304,Amy,6, Save you first; come back for Raj only if there's time.,8,Big Bang Theory,56,11
38305,Raj,6, We're going to be fine.,8,Big Bang Theory,24,5
38306,Amy,6," Sheldon, I'm really impressed you're willing to try this.",8,Big Bang Theory,58,9
38307,Sheldon,6," Well, admittedly, this brushes up against my well-known aversions to heat, small places, going below floor-level, dampness, hatches, ladders, darkness, echoes, and eliminating in Home Depot buckets. That last one is quite new, but I have a feeling that's gonna rocket to the top of the list.",8,Big Bang Theory,292,47
38308,Raj,6, I'm sweating already.,8,Big Bang Theory,22,3
38309,Sheldon,6," Yeah, as the person beneath you, allow me to say, I know.",8,Big Bang Theory,58,12
38310,Raj,6, How hot is it?,8,Big Bang Theory,15,4
38311,Sheldon,6," Uh, let's see. 704? No, wait, it's on clock. Uh, the real answer isn't much better. 102 degrees.",8,Big Bang Theory,97,18
38312,Raj,6," Well, that's what we wanted. This is as hot as the mines will be.",8,Big Bang Theory,66,14
38313,Sheldon,6," True. Sheldon's Mine Simulation Log, entry one. Koothrappali's restating of the obvious is already getting on my nerves.",8,Big Bang Theory,121,18
38315,Leonard,6, Thanks again for having us.,8,Big Bang Theory,28,5
38316,Howard,6," Oh, of course. What did you guys want to talk about?",8,Big Bang Theory,53,11
38317,Penny,6," Well, you know, now that we're engaged, we had some questions about how you handle money as a couple.",8,Big Bang Theory,102,19
38319,Howard,6, I didn't think they were going to. I just wanted to have a way to say no without hurting Leonard's feelings.,8,Big Bang Theory,109,21
38320,Leonard,6," Well, nailed it.",8,Big Bang Theory,17,3
38321,Howard,6, So what did you want to know?,8,Big Bang Theory,30,7
38322,Penny,6," Well, do you guys ever fight over money?",8,Big Bang Theory,41,8
38324,Howard,6, You didn't have to say so much more.,8,Big Bang Theory,37,8
38326,Howard,6," I brought a lot of significant assets into the relationship, too.",8,Big Bang Theory,66,11
38328,Howard,6," For your information, I just bought the last one I needed on eBay.",8,Big Bang Theory,67,13
38330,Howard,6, There were only three minutes left in the auction and it was a mint condition Scotty from a smoke-free home.,8,Big Bang Theory,109,20
38332,Howard,6, Not a lot.,8,Big Bang Theory,11,3
38334,Howard,6, Let's not talk about this in front of our friends.,8,Big Bang Theory,51,10
38336,Howard,6," For the tenth time, that was a Groupon.",8,Big Bang Theory,40,8
38337,Leonard,6, Like I would swing with him.,8,Big Bang Theory,29,6
38339,Raj,6, How you feeling?,8,Big Bang Theory,17,3
38340,Sheldon,6, Good. Little claustrophobic.,8,Big Bang Theory,29,3
38341,Raj,6, Let's set up the equipment. It'll help take your mind off of it.,8,Big Bang Theory,65,13
38342,Sheldon,6, Miners often sang mining songs to keep their spirits up.,8,Big Bang Theory,57,10
38343,Raj,6, Do you know any mining songs?,8,Big Bang Theory,30,6
38344,Sheldon,6," Just the hits.  Where it's dark as a dungeon, and it's damp as the dew.",8,Big Bang Theory,72,15
38346,Sheldon,6," Where the dangers are double, and the pleasures are few. Where the rain never falls and the sun never shines, yes, it's dark as a dungeon way down in the mine.",8,Big Bang Theory,160,31
38347,Raj,6, It's a little more bleak than I thought.,8,Big Bang Theory,41,8
38348,Sheldon,6," Well, I pray when I'm dead and the ages shall roll, that my body will blacken and turn into coal.",8,Big Bang Theory,98,20
38349,Raj,6, Getting kind of grim.,8,Big Bang Theory,22,4
38350,Sheldon,6," Then I'll look from the door of my heavenly home, and pity the miner that mines my poor bones.",8,Big Bang Theory,95,19
38351,Raj,6, Okay. How 'bout a little Miley Cyrus next?,8,Big Bang Theory,43,8
38352,Sheldon,6, Who's he?,8,Big Bang Theory,10,2
38354,Howard,6, Talk about wasted money. What about the late fees on our credit card because somebody didn't pay the bill on time?,8,Big Bang Theory,115,21
38356,Howard,6," Oh, you're saying I don't do anything around here. Look at my chore chart.",8,Big Bang Theory,75,14
38357,Leonard,6, She made him a chore chart.,8,Big Bang Theory,28,6
38358,Penny,6, I see it.,8,Big Bang Theory,10,3
38359,Howard,6, Do the dishes. There's a star right there.,8,Big Bang Theory,43,8
38361,Howard,6, That pan had to soak and you know it.,8,Big Bang Theory,38,9
38363,Howard,6," It's not an allowance. It's a stipend, and we said we weren't gonna call it an allowance in front of my friends.",8,Big Bang Theory,113,22
38364,Leonard,6," I usually don't like lemon bars, but these, these are really good.",8,Big Bang Theory,67,12
38366,Raj,6," So, as Hannah Montana, Miley was a world-famous pop star. But then she would take off her wig and go to school like a normal girl. Which, I don't have to tell you, at that age, is its own headache.",8,Big Bang Theory,198,40
38367,Sheldon,6, That's preposterous. How would she go unrecognized just by wearing a wig?,8,Big Bang Theory,74,12
38368,Raj,6, But you're okay with Superman concealing his identity with a pair of glasses?,8,Big Bang Theory,78,13
38369,Sheldon,6, He doesn't just put on a pair of glasses. He combs back his curlicue and affects a mild-mannered personality.,8,Big Bang Theory,110,19
38370,Amy,6, You guys doing okay down there?,8,Big Bang Theory,32,6
38371,Sheldon,6, I told you to use the walkie-talkie!,8,Big Bang Theory,37,7
38372,Amy,6, You guys doing okay down there?,8,Big Bang Theory,32,6
38373,Sheldon,6, Please keep this channel clear for emergencies. Thank you.,8,Big Bang Theory,59,9
38374,Amy,6, I'm going to the vending machine. Do you want anything?,8,Big Bang Theory,56,10
38375,Sheldon,6, This is a simulation. We have to survive on the supplies we brought.,8,Big Bang Theory,69,13
38376,Amy,6," Okay, just checking.",8,Big Bang Theory,21,3
38377,Raj,6, We should have asked her to get some Funyuns.,8,Big Bang Theory,46,9
38378,Sheldon,6, You're not going to have Funyuns when we're a mile below the surface of the Earth.,8,Big Bang Theory,83,16
38379,Raj,6, What if we brought them down with us?,8,Big Bang Theory,38,8
38380,Sheldon,6, We'll take some Funyuns.,8,Big Bang Theory,25,4
38381,Amy,6, Anything else?,8,Big Bang Theory,15,2
38382,Sheldon,6," Some York Peppermint Patties, a couple of Dr. Peppers, and run to Best Buy and see if they have a portable DVD player and season one of a show called Hannah Montana.",8,Big Bang Theory,166,32
38386,Penny,6," Oh, don't apologize.",8,Big Bang Theory,21,3
38387,Leonard,6, Yeah. It just makes it a lot harder to pretend it never happened.,8,Big Bang Theory,66,13
38389,Penny,6, It really bothers him?,8,Big Bang Theory,23,4
38391,Penny,6, Uh-oh.,8,Big Bang Theory,7,1
38392,Leonard,6, What?,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
38393,Penny,6," Well, if I do well in sales, I could end up making a lot more money than you.",8,Big Bang Theory,78,18
38394,Leonard,6," Not a problem. I grew up with a mother who emasculated my father financially and in every other aspect of his life, so really, it's what I think love looks like.",8,Big Bang Theory,162,31
38396,Penny,6, Maybe it's a good thing we came here. It's like a lesson in what not to do.,8,Big Bang Theory,76,17
38397,Leonard,6, Yeah I don't want something dumb like money to come between us.,8,Big Bang Theory,64,12
38398,Penny,6, It won't. Let's just promise to figure this kind of stuff out before we get married.,8,Big Bang Theory,85,16
38399,Howard,6, Why are you being so bossy?,8,Big Bang Theory,28,6
38401,Howard,6," I'm not a baby. I'm a grown man, and I made the bed. Now where's my star?",8,Big Bang Theory,74,17
38402,Leonard,6, Should we go?,8,Big Bang Theory,14,3
38403,Penny,6, Hang on. I want to see if he gets the star.,8,Big Bang Theory,44,11
38405,Raj,6," Oh, this heat is brutal.",8,Big Bang Theory,25,5
38406,Sheldon,6," As someone from the tropical subcontinent of India, you should know that fanning yourself in a humid environment only raises your body temperature.",8,Big Bang Theory,148,23
38408,Sheldon,6, My major focus at the moment is keeping my claustrophobia at bay.,8,Big Bang Theory,66,12
38409,Raj,6, How's that going?,8,Big Bang Theory,18,3
38410,Sheldon,6," You tell me. I feel like I can't breathe, and I am tempted to crack you open and suck the air right out of your lungs.",8,Big Bang Theory,119,26
38411,Raj,6," Sheldon, if this is too much, we can stop.",8,Big Bang Theory,43,9
38412,Sheldon,6, We're not stopping.,8,Big Bang Theory,20,3
38413,Raj,6, You don't have to bite my head off.,8,Big Bang Theory,36,8
38414,Sheldon,6," I apologize. I just, I'm plagued by an internal struggle.",8,Big Bang Theory,58,10
38415,Raj,6," If you would just use the bucket, you'd be so much more comfortable.",8,Big Bang Theory,69,13
38416,Sheldon,6, My struggle is emotional.,8,Big Bang Theory,26,4
38417,Raj,6, Oh. Is it Amy?,8,Big Bang Theory,15,4
38418,Sheldon,6," It's dark matter. When I entered the field of string theory, I was a prodigy. I rose to a position of respect, and I assumed my career would continue on that upward trajectory. Now here I am in my 30s, I'm back at square one. And, frankly, it's frightening.",8,Big Bang Theory,258,49
38419,Raj,6," Sheldon, you know what I think of when I'm scared? Voyager.",8,Big Bang Theory,60,11
38420,Sheldon,6, Voyager the space probe or Voyager the Star Trek TV show?,8,Big Bang Theory,58,11
38421,Raj,6, The space probe.,8,Big Bang Theory,17,3
38422,Sheldon,6, Good. Because I am too hot and tired to go on about how much I hate Voyager the TV show.,8,Big Bang Theory,89,20
38423,Raj,6," By the time I was born, Voyager 1's mission was supposed to be over. It had seen Jupiter and Saturn and all their moons, but it kept going. When I left India for America, I was never more scared in my life. I had no idea what lay ahead. Whenever I feel that way, I think about how Voyager is still out there somewhere beyond our solar system, going further than anyone ever thought it could. Don't leave. You can do this.",8,Big Bang Theory,422,82
38424,Amy,6," Sheldon, is everything okay?",8,Big Bang Theory,29,4
38425,Sheldon,6, It's too late for Koothrappali. Let's go.,8,Big Bang Theory,42,7
38426,Amy,6, 11 minutes. That's longer than I thought.,8,Big Bang Theory,42,7
38427,Raj,6, They're in my shirt. They're in my shirt. They're in my shirt.,8,Big Bang Theory,63,12
38429,Penny,6," Okay, this is definitely the most fun thing we can do with the money.",8,Big Bang Theory,70,14
38430,Leonard,6," I've never done it on a big old pile of cash before. Me neither, Leonard. It's my first time, too.",8,Big Bang Theory,99,20
38433,Howard,6, It's okay.,8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
38435,Howard,6," I want that, too.",8,Big Bang Theory,18,4
38437,Howard,6," Ooh, laser tag, laser tag.",8,Big Bang Theory,27,5
38440,Amy,6, Do you really need me to transcribe this?,8,Big Bang Theory,42,8
38441,Sheldon,6," You're not doing it for me. You're doing it for future generations who will benefit from my struggle.  Sheldon's Mine Simulation Log, entry four. My Kit Kat has melted. All is lost.",8,Big Bang Theory,182,32
38442,Raj,6," You call yourself a friend? I was trying to help you, and at the first sign of trouble you ran away, leaving me to fend off a family of rats. You're a completely selfish human being and a, and a physical and a moral coward.",8,Big Bang Theory,224,45
38443,Sheldon,6, His statements of the obvious continue to annoy.,8,Big Bang Theory,49,8
38446,Amy,7, I'm studying one-celled organisms to try and find the neurochemicals that lead to the feeling of shame.,8,Big Bang Theory,104,17
38448,Penny,7," Same as all of us, getting out of a car without underwear.",8,Big Bang Theory,59,12
38450,Penny,7," Okay, if it's sometimes Howie wears yours, Leonard already told us.",8,Big Bang Theory,68,11
38452,Amy,7, I think it's awful.,8,Big Bang Theory,20,4
38453,Penny,7, Why would you say that?,8,Big Bang Theory,24,5
38454,Amy,7," Bernadette is a successful microbiologist. She should be celebrated for her achievements, not her looks. I mean, what kind of message does that send?",8,Big Bang Theory,150,24
38455,Penny,7, I think the message is check out the rack on that scientist.,8,Big Bang Theory,61,12
38457,Amy,7, I just don't think a professional woman should have to flaunt her sexuality in order to get ahead.,8,Big Bang Theory,99,18
38458,Penny,7," Okay, what's the big deal? Look, if it helps me make a sale with a physician, I don't think it hurts to flirt a little. I mean, laugh at their joke, touch their arm, maybe crank up the AC in the car beforehand, you know, to wake up the girls.",8,Big Bang Theory,243,50
38459,Amy,7," Maybe it's different in the world of sales, but it's already hard enough for women to be taken seriously in science.",8,Big Bang Theory,117,21
38461,Penny,7," No, I think you should do whatever you want. You know, maybe if fashion magazines had female scientists in them, I would've become a theoretical physicist. Stop smirking at each other.",8,Big Bang Theory,185,31
38464,Sheldon,7," No, thank you. Delivery men are the unsung foot soldiers of our nation's commerce. It's because of people like you, people like me can limit our human contact. I'd shake your hand, but, well, you know.",8,Big Bang Theory,202,36
38466,Sheldon,7, That's humorous.,8,Big Bang Theory,17,2
38468,Sheldon,7," Yeah, I bet you leave your patients in stitches. That was also humorous.",8,Big Bang Theory,73,13
38470,Sheldon,7, Are you bringing flowers to a patient to cushion the blow of a terminal diagnosis? That wasn't a joke.,8,Big Bang Theory,103,19
38472,Sheldon,7," Hmm. You know, they have delivery people that will do that for you.",8,Big Bang Theory,68,13
38474,Sheldon,7, Making the extra effort. Good for you.,8,Big Bang Theory,39,7
38475,Leonard,7," Great timing, food just got here.",8,Big Bang Theory,34,6
38476,Sheldon,7," Ooh, Siam Palace?",8,Big Bang Theory,18,3
38477,Leonard,7, Yes.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
38478,Sheldon,7," Uh, mee krob and chicken satay?",8,Big Bang Theory,32,6
38479,Leonard,7, Yes.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
38480,Sheldon,7," Uh, extra peanut sauce?",8,Big Bang Theory,24,4
38481,Leonard,7," No, but you can have mine.",8,Big Bang Theory,27,6
38482,Sheldon,7," Eh, well, very well. Oh, and on the topic of sharing things that are yours, there is a gentleman caller bringing flowers to your fiancÃ©e as we speak.",8,Big Bang Theory,151,28
38483,Leonard,7, What? Why didn't you say that first?,8,Big Bang Theory,37,7
38484,Sheldon,7, Why didn't you get extra peanut sauce? We can both play this game.,8,Big Bang Theory,67,13
38485,Leonard,7, Can I help you?,8,Big Bang Theory,16,4
38487,Leonard,7, May I ask why?,8,Big Bang Theory,15,4
38489,Leonard,7," Okay, um, look, I'm pretty sure she didn't wink at you.",8,Big Bang Theory,56,11
38491,Leonard,7," I got it, I got it. Listen, um, I think there's been a misunderstanding. See, Penny is my fiancÃ©e.",8,Big Bang Theory,100,19
38493,Raj,7, Really?,8,Big Bang Theory,8,1
38495,Leonard,7, I think so.,8,Big Bang Theory,12,3
38497,Leonard,7, Excuse me?,8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
38499,Leonard,7, Thank you. Sorry.,8,Big Bang Theory,18,3
38501,Sheldon,7," Hold on, Doctor. Leonard, where are your social skills? This man is clearly upset. We should invite him in for a hot beverage.",8,Big Bang Theory,127,23
38502,Leonard,7, He tried to score with Penny.,8,Big Bang Theory,30,6
38503,Sheldon,7," So have these two, and they're having dinner with us.",8,Big Bang Theory,54,10
38505,Amy,7," So, how was work today?",8,Big Bang Theory,24,5
38507,Amy,7, What happened?,8,Big Bang Theory,15,2
38509,Amy,7," Well, I'm really sorry, but I think it's for the best. You want people focusing on your achievements, not staring at your breasts in some magazine.",8,Big Bang Theory,148,26
38511,Amy,7," Sorry, it's just we're, we were talking about them. So, look, I, I wasn't going to say anything, but since you seem to be okay with the article being canceled, I have a little confession. I'm the reason it was pulled.",8,Big Bang Theory,218,41
38513,Amy,7, I sent the editors of the magazine a pretty scathing e-mail.,8,Big Bang Theory,61,11
38515,Amy,7," I simply pointed out that they would never consider doing an article ranking male scientists on their sexuality, let alone showing them in various stages of undress.",8,Big Bang Theory,166,27
38517,Amy,7," Well, it doesn't make a difference, because they agreed it was in bad taste, and now you agree, so Amy saves the day.",8,Big Bang Theory,118,23
38519,Amy,7, But it was bad publicity.,8,Big Bang Theory,26,5
38521,Amy,7," I disagree. As a female scientist, I think what you do affects all of us.",8,Big Bang Theory,74,15
38523,Amy,7, You have a nice night.,8,Big Bang Theory,23,5
38526,Sheldon,7," Here you go, Doctor. Red Zinger with one teaspoon of honey.",8,Big Bang Theory,60,11
38528,Raj,7," Oh, cool.",8,Big Bang Theory,10,2
38529,Howard,7, How'd you get that?,8,Big Bang Theory,20,4
38533,Howard,7," Wow, he really went where no man has gone before.",8,Big Bang Theory,50,10
38539,Leonard,7, That is amazing. How long have you been collecting?,8,Big Bang Theory,52,9
38541,Sheldon,7, What'd you get? What'd you get?,8,Big Bang Theory,32,6
38543,Raj,7, I would love to see your collection.,8,Big Bang Theory,37,7
38545,Howard,7, We know.,8,Big Bang Theory,9,2
38546,Raj,7, Preach.,8,Big Bang Theory,8,1
38548,Leonard,7, Sure.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
38550,Leonard,7," Oh. Well, you know, just being myself, really.",8,Big Bang Theory,47,8
38551,Sheldon,7," Oh, please, you know, I'll tell you how he did it. Implacable, relentless badgering. In urology terms, he was a drug-resistant staph infection. And she was a urethra that could not shake him.",8,Big Bang Theory,192,33
38552,Leonard,7, I don't know that I'd call myself an infection.,8,Big Bang Theory,48,9
38553,Howard,7, A gallant man would defend his fiancÃ©e for being called a urethra.,8,Big Bang Theory,68,12
38554,Leonard,7, Can we please change the subject?,8,Big Bang Theory,34,6
38555,Penny,7, Hi.,8,Big Bang Theory,4,1
38556,Raj,7," Well, that didn't go your way.",8,Big Bang Theory,31,6
38557,Penny,7," Dr. Lorvis, what are you doing here?",8,Big Bang Theory,37,7
38559,Penny,7, Really? Why?,8,Big Bang Theory,13,2
38560,Leonard,7," Ah, that's a good question. Apparently someone was being awfully flirty while not wearing their engagement ring, causing another someone to show up here thinking the first someone might be available.",8,Big Bang Theory,200,31
38561,Sheldon,7," Oh, God. Don't make it so hard on her. Look, the first someone is the deceitful you. The second someone is the delightful Dr. Lorvis.",8,Big Bang Theory,134,25
38562,Penny,7," Oh, this is very embarrassing. Dr. Lorvis, I am so sorry. I did not mean to lead you on.",8,Big Bang Theory,89,19
38564,Penny,7, Oh. That's why you were mumbling Mississippi.,8,Big Bang Theory,46,7
38565,Leonard,7, Can we talk in private?,8,Big Bang Theory,24,5
38566,Penny,7," Please, yes.",8,Big Bang Theory,13,2
38567,Leonard,7, I'll be right back.,8,Big Bang Theory,20,4
38568,Sheldon,7, So what other celebrity genitalia have you handled?,8,Big Bang Theory,52,8
38569,Leonard,7," So, uh, what's the deal? You take off your ring when you go to work?",8,Big Bang Theory,69,15
38570,Penny,7," What? No, no, I just put it on the other hand and turn it around. Keep that hand in my pocket.",8,Big Bang Theory,95,21
38571,Leonard,7, Why?,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
38572,Penny,7," Well, what do you mean why? Look, I make more sales if these doctors think I'm single. I did the same kind of thing as a waitress. The real question is, what is he doing in your apartment?",8,Big Bang Theory,189,38
38573,Leonard,7," Oh, he was upset. So Sheldon invited him in for a hot beverage.",8,Big Bang Theory,64,13
38574,Penny,7, You were okay with that?,8,Big Bang Theory,25,5
38575,Leonard,7," No. I got upset. And Sheldon made me a beverage, too.",8,Big Bang Theory,54,11
38576,Penny,7," Okay, he just showed up at my door. Don't you think that's a little weird?",8,Big Bang Theory,75,15
38577,Leonard,7," A little, but he's basically harmless. He's actually kind of a nice guy.",8,Big Bang Theory,73,13
38578,Penny,7," Okay. Whatever, look, my company does not allow me to socialize with doctors outside of work. You got to get rid of him.",8,Big Bang Theory,121,23
38579,Leonard,7, Why am I the one that has to get rid of him?,8,Big Bang Theory,45,12
38580,Penny,7," I can't do it, he's my best client.",8,Big Bang Theory,36,8
38581,Leonard,7," All right, I'll get rid of him. But you owe me one.",8,Big Bang Theory,52,12
38582,Raj,7," Hey, we're going to Oliver's house to see his collection. You want to go with us?",8,Big Bang Theory,82,16
38583,Leonard,7," Yeah, sure. You owe me.",8,Big Bang Theory,24,5
38585,Leonard,7," Oh, my God.",8,Big Bang Theory,12,3
38586,Sheldon,7," Leonard, I was wrong. Heaven does exist. And it's in the basement of a urologist's house in Sherman Oaks.",8,Big Bang Theory,106,19
38588,Howard,7," Oh, come on. It's a replica.",8,Big Bang Theory,29,6
38590,Howard,7," Oh, I think I just cheated on my wife.",8,Big Bang Theory,39,9
38591,Raj,7, The gun from Hellboy?,8,Big Bang Theory,22,4
38593,Raj,7, How did you get it?,8,Big Bang Theory,20,5
38595,Raj,7," Oh, I was hoping for a juicy tidbit about Ron Perlman's testicles.",8,Big Bang Theory,67,12
38598,Howard,7," Still lives with his ma. Yikes, right?",8,Big Bang Theory,39,7
38599,Raj,7," Yeah, I'm not quite sure how to respond.",8,Big Bang Theory,41,8
38600,Leonard,7," Wow, Donkey Kong. This, this was my game when I was a kid.",8,Big Bang Theory,59,13
38601,Sheldon,7," Because it's a story of a pretty blonde girl tirelessly pursued by a small, oddly-shaped man?",8,Big Bang Theory,94,16
38602,Leonard,7," No, because I liked it.",8,Big Bang Theory,24,5
38603,Sheldon,7," Well, now, don't get defensive. You're oddly-shaped, but you got the girl.",8,Big Bang Theory,75,12
38605,Sheldon,7," Yes. If you'd like to join in, the premise is their love seems unlikely and doomed to failure.",8,Big Bang Theory,95,18
38607,Sheldon,7," Oh, if you want to get in on the pool, you're too late. All the squares have been purchased.",8,Big Bang Theory,93,19
38609,Sheldon,7," Leonard, as your friend I feel I should tell you something.",8,Big Bang Theory,60,11
38610,Leonard,7, What?,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
38611,Sheldon,7, I'm still upset about that peanut sauce.,8,Big Bang Theory,41,7
38614,Amy,7, Nice flowers.,8,Big Bang Theory,14,2
38616,Amy,7, Isn't she lucky?,8,Big Bang Theory,17,3
38618,Amy,7, What's that?,8,Big Bang Theory,13,2
38620,Amy,7, I guess that's all anybody wants.,8,Big Bang Theory,34,6
38622,Amy,7," Well, I hope you get it.",8,Big Bang Theory,25,6
38625,Leonard,7," Next game, let's switch helmets.",8,Big Bang Theory,33,5
38626,Sheldon,7," No, I'd look silly in that helmet.",8,Big Bang Theory,35,7
38628,Amy,7, I can't take these.,8,Big Bang Theory,20,4
38630,Amy,7, But what about the other girl?,8,Big Bang Theory,31,6
38632,Penny,7, Dr. Lorvis?,8,Big Bang Theory,12,2
38635,Raj,7, You think he bites?,8,Big Bang Theory,20,4
38636,Howard,7, Stick your head in there and find out.,8,Big Bang Theory,39,8
38637,Raj,7, You fooled me with that goat at the petting zoo. You will not fool me again.,8,Big Bang Theory,77,16
38638,Leonard,7, I wonder where Dr. Lorvis is. He's been gone a while.,8,Big Bang Theory,54,11
38639,Raj,7, Maybe he's playing bingo with his mommy.,8,Big Bang Theory,41,7
38640,Howard,7, It's sad how some guys can't cut the apron strings.,8,Big Bang Theory,52,10
38641,Raj,7," Okay, now you're messing with me.",8,Big Bang Theory,34,6
38642,Leonard,7," Uh, guys, we're locked in here.",8,Big Bang Theory,32,6
38643,Sheldon,7," Oh, this day just keeps getting better.",8,Big Bang Theory,40,7
38645,Penny,7," So, you just left them alone playing games in your house?",8,Big Bang Theory,58,11
38647,Amy,7, We all have a past.,8,Big Bang Theory,20,5
38648,Penny,7," Doc, you've got to see what you're doing is, is a little creepy.",8,Big Bang Theory,65,13
38650,Penny,7," Okay, you can't just go chasing after every girl who's nice to you.",8,Big Bang Theory,68,13
38652,Penny,7," Hey, Leonard. Guess who's back. Dr. Lorvis. Yeah. You care to join us? What? You locked them in your basement?",8,Big Bang Theory,111,20
38654,Penny,7," Okay, so how do they unstick it?",8,Big Bang Theory,33,7
38656,Penny,7," Okay. Nope. That's it. We are gonna go over there right now, and you are going to let them out.",8,Big Bang Theory,96,20
38658,Penny,7, Move it.,8,Big Bang Theory,9,2
38661,Amy,7, That has to wait. This weirdo locked the guys up in his basement.,8,Big Bang Theory,66,13
38664,Penny,7, Just walk.,8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
38666,Sheldon,7, You can do this.,8,Big Bang Theory,17,4
38667,Raj,7, One ladder left.,8,Big Bang Theory,17,3
38668,Leonard,7, Oh-hom yeah.,8,Big Bang Theory,13,2
38669,Howard,7, Yes.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
38670,Leonard,7, Next level.,8,Big Bang Theory,12,2
38671,Penny,7," Leonard, are you okay?",8,Big Bang Theory,23,4
38672,Leonard,7, Better than okay. I am having the game of my life.,8,Big Bang Theory,51,11
38673,Amy,7," Dr. Lorvis, isn't there something you want to say?",8,Big Bang Theory,51,9
38675,Howard,7," Yeah, that was very uncool. Get the hammer. Get the hammer.",8,Big Bang Theory,60,11
38676,Leonard,7, Got it.,8,Big Bang Theory,8,2
38677,Penny,7," Okay, Leonard, let's go.",8,Big Bang Theory,25,4
38678,Leonard,7, Just hang on.,8,Big Bang Theory,14,3
38680,Amy,7, Sure.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
38681,Penny,7, Yeah.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
38684,Leonard,8," Oh, hey, oh, we ran into your mom at Benihana last night.",8,Big Bang Theory,58,12
38685,Howard,8," Oh, yeah, she loves that place. Every time they flip a shrimp in the air, she practically leaps out of her seat to catch it. That's why I don't take her to SeaWorld.",8,Big Bang Theory,166,33
38686,Leonard,8," I know you-you don't want to hear it, but she was there with Stuart.",8,Big Bang Theory,69,14
38687,Howard,8, That's fine. I don't care.,8,Big Bang Theory,27,5
38689,Howard,8, They're not dating. They're just two friends who went out to dinner.,8,Big Bang Theory,69,12
38690,Raj,8, And then went back to the home they share where they probably fell asleep in the matching pajamas she got them because they both just love penguins.,8,Big Bang Theory,149,27
38691,Howard,8," Hey, lots of people wear matching pajamas who aren't dating.",8,Big Bang Theory,61,10
38692,Raj,8, Like who?,8,Big Bang Theory,10,2
38693,Howard,8, Like you and your dog.,8,Big Bang Theory,23,5
38694,Leonard,8, Don't rule out the dating.,8,Big Bang Theory,27,5
38695,Howard,8," Fine, it bothers me. You happy?",8,Big Bang Theory,32,6
38696,Sheldon,8, You think you've got problems. The gibbon is the only member of the ape family not classified as a great ape.,8,Big Bang Theory,110,21
38697,Howard,8, How is this helpful?,8,Big Bang Theory,21,4
38698,Sheldon,8, All the non-human apes are classified as great apes except one. That means taxonomists created the entire category of lesser ape just to single out the poor gibbon as the weird kid on the playground. Now there's a hairy little fellow with a genuine beef.,8,Big Bang Theory,255,45
38699,Leonard,8, But the gibbon doesn't know what it's categorized as. It doesn't even know it's called a gibbon.,8,Big Bang Theory,97,17
38700,Sheldon,8," True. Sorry, kid, you've got it worse than a gibbon.",8,Big Bang Theory,53,10
38702,Amy,8, Hi.,8,Big Bang Theory,4,1
38703,Penny,8, Hey.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
38705,Penny,8," Oh, great. I don't suppose you also brought napkins, clean bowls, utensils and a roll of toilet paper.",8,Big Bang Theory,103,18
38707,Penny,8," Ah, You guys are the best.",8,Big Bang Theory,27,6
38708,Amy,8, What's with the clothes?,8,Big Bang Theory,25,4
38709,Penny,8," Well, with all the new stuff I bought for work, I needed to make room in my closet.",8,Big Bang Theory,84,18
38710,Amy,8," I meant why are they folded? But whatever. Ooh, what's this?",8,Big Bang Theory,61,11
38711,Penny,8," That, believe it or not, is my prom dress.",8,Big Bang Theory,43,9
38713,Penny,8, What kind of teenager did you think I was?,8,Big Bang Theory,43,9
38715,Amy,8, Easy.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
38716,Penny,8, The word is popular.,8,Big Bang Theory,21,4
38718,Amy,8," No, but I was on clean-up crew.",8,Big Bang Theory,32,7
38719,Penny,8," Aw, that's sad.",8,Big Bang Theory,16,3
38720,Amy,8," No, it was okay. The DJ let me dance one slow song with my mop before he shut down. Whenever I see a bucket of dirty water, I still hear Lady in Red.",8,Big Bang Theory,150,33
38722,Amy,8," Okay, we get it, you had a friend and a date. Stop bragging.",8,Big Bang Theory,61,13
38723,Penny,8, Doesn't matter. Prom is silly anyways.,8,Big Bang Theory,39,6
38725,Penny,8, No. I just made out with him a little while his date was puking.,8,Big Bang Theory,65,14
38726,Amy,8, My date would've had to clean that up.,8,Big Bang Theory,39,8
38728,Amy,8," Oh, that would be so much fun. We could decorate the roof and make the guys wear tuxedos.",8,Big Bang Theory,90,18
38730,Penny,8," Okay, guys, trust me, as someone who's been to, like, seven proms, it is never as good as you want it to be.",8,Big Bang Theory,109,23
38731,Amy,8, You went to seven proms?,8,Big Bang Theory,25,5
38732,Penny,8," Yeah, let's see. Uh, four Under the Seas, two Enchanted Evenings, and one Night to Remember that I cannot remember for the life of me.",8,Big Bang Theory,135,25
38734,Howard,8, Hey.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
38735,Raj,8, Hey.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
38736,Leonard,8," Hey, where's Bernadette?",8,Big Bang Theory,25,3
38737,Howard,8, She and Amy are out dress shopping for their prom thing.,8,Big Bang Theory,57,11
38738,Raj,8," Oh, yeah, I got that Evite. Ever since I saw Pretty in Pink, I've wanted to go to an American prom. But then I saw Carrie, and I did not want to go to an American prom. But then I saw Never Been Kissed, and I'm back on the prom bandwagon. This prom thing's been a real roller coaster.",8,Big Bang Theory,285,59
38739,Howard,8," Bernie's really excited. I could tell because her voice got so high, the beagle next door started howling.",8,Big Bang Theory,107,18
38740,Raj,8, Did you go to your prom?,8,Big Bang Theory,25,6
38741,Sheldon,8," No. I had a date with a proper education. Instead of a tuxedo, I dressed myself in good habits. Instead of spiked punch, I enjoyed the intoxicating flavour of knowledge. Instead of dancing in a gym, I shook my bootyto the seductive rhythms",8,Big Bang Theory,240,43
38742,Penny,8," Okay, okay.",8,Big Bang Theory,12,2
38744,Raj,8, How come you're not shopping with Amy and Bernadette?,8,Big Bang Theory,54,9
38745,Leonard,8," Let me guess, you think the whole idea is lame?",8,Big Bang Theory,48,10
38746,Penny,8," Well, who cares what I think? What do you think?",8,Big Bang Theory,49,10
38747,Leonard,8," Hmm, to be honest, it's kind of a dream come true to go to even a fake prom with a woman as beautiful as you.",8,Big Bang Theory,110,25
38748,Penny,8," Ugh, thanks a lot.",8,Big Bang Theory,19,4
38749,Leonard,8, What?,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
38750,Penny,8," Well, now I can't blow this thing off without being a bitch.",8,Big Bang Theory,61,12
38751,Raj,8, That sounds like a yes.,8,Big Bang Theory,24,5
38754,Howard,8, Yep.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
38756,Howard,8, You know exactly who it is. He's gonna bring my mom. Why did you even invite him?,8,Big Bang Theory,82,17
38758,Howard,8," I didn't take her, she was a chaperone.",8,Big Bang Theory,40,8
38760,Howard,8, What was I gonna do? They were playing our song. I can't take this anymore.,8,Big Bang Theory,76,15
38762,Howard,8," Stuart, we have to talk. This thing with you and my mom, I hate it. It's making me crazy. You and I were friends for years, and now you're bringing my mother to a party I'm going to? What the hell?",8,Big Bang Theory,198,41
38764,Howard,8," Oh, so now you're cheating on my mother?",8,Big Bang Theory,41,8
38769,Sheldon,8,  Penny?  Penny?  Penny?  Penny?  Penny?,8,Big Bang Theory,40,5
38770,Penny,8, You knocked more than usual.,8,Big Bang Theory,29,5
38771,Sheldon,8," Next time I might be in a rush, it's good to have a few in the bank.",8,Big Bang Theory,69,17
38772,Penny,8," Okay, what's up?",8,Big Bang Theory,17,3
38773,Sheldon,8," I'd like to discuss this party that Amy and Bernadette are throwing. Since you and I are both reluctant to go, I think I've come up with a perfect way for us to enjoy it.",8,Big Bang Theory,171,35
38774,Penny,8," Great, how?",8,Big Bang Theory,12,2
38775,Sheldon,8," We pretend we're aliens. I'm not the best at reading facial cues, but I'm gonna say that you love it and want to hear more. Now, in the beloved novel Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, an alien named Ford Prefect pretended to be human in order to blend in so that he could write an entry about Earth for The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, which is a travel book within the actual book, which is also called The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.",8,Big Bang Theory,447,84
38776,Penny,8," Okay, just one question. What?",8,Big Bang Theory,31,5
38777,Sheldon,8," My point is, pretending to be an alien is a valuable coping mechanism I've used many times. I did it the first time I went to see you in a play. You had no idea Commander Umfrumf of Ceti Alpha Three was in the audience. Oh, don't worry, he gave you seven thumbs up.",8,Big Bang Theory,266,54
38778,Penny,8," Here's a question, as an alien pretending to be human, are you planning to engage in any post-prom mating rituals with Amy?",8,Big Bang Theory,124,22
38779,Sheldon,8, There are post-prom mating rituals?,8,Big Bang Theory,36,5
38780,Penny,8," Not always. Unless your date drives a van with an air mattress, then always.",8,Big Bang Theory,77,14
38781,Sheldon,8," Well, if it's part of the prom experience, then I'm open to it.",8,Big Bang Theory,64,13
38782,Penny,8, You're kidding.,8,Big Bang Theory,16,2
38783,Sheldon,8," I may be an alien, but I have urges. If Amy wants to copulate by firing her eggs into space, well, then, I will happily catch them with the reproductive sac on my upper flermin. I'm not the best at reading facial cues, but I can see that you're a little turned on.",8,Big Bang Theory,265,53
38785,Leonard,8," You know, if you're not gonna learn how to do this, they make some pretty good clip-ons.",8,Big Bang Theory,89,17
38786,Sheldon,8, Bruce Wayne doesn't wear a clip-on.,8,Big Bang Theory,36,6
38787,Leonard,8, Bruce Wayne doesn't make his roommate tie it for him.,8,Big Bang Theory,54,10
38788,Sheldon,8," His name is Alfred, and, yes, he does.",8,Big Bang Theory,39,8
38789,Leonard,8," There, perfect.",8,Big Bang Theory,16,2
38790,Sheldon,8," What, are you sure? It's my first prom, I want to do it correctly.",8,Big Bang Theory,67,14
38791,Leonard,8, I thought you were gonna pretend to be an alien.,8,Big Bang Theory,49,10
38792,Sheldon,8," I was, but Penny didn't want to. You didn't want to. Bernadette, Amy, Koothrappali and Wolowitz didn't want to. And even I knew it was weird to hire somebody.",8,Big Bang Theory,159,29
38793,Leonard,8, Was that a flask?,8,Big Bang Theory,18,4
38794,Sheldon,8," Yes. I've decided to embrace all of the traditions associated with prom, including spiking the punch.",8,Big Bang Theory,102,16
38795,Leonard,8, You're gonna put alcohol in the punch?,8,Big Bang Theory,39,7
38796,Sheldon,8," Oh, no, this is pomegranate juice. It's all the fun of high school high jinks with the cell-protecting zip of antioxidants.",8,Big Bang Theory,124,21
38797,Leonard,8," If you had ripped jeans and a leather jacket, you'd be like the toughest kid on the Disney Channel. So, anything else planned for tonight?",8,Big Bang Theory,139,25
38798,Sheldon,8," Oh, everything. Getting our picture taken, slow-dancing, being elected prom king. Pointing out that kings aren't elected. It's gonna be off the hook.",8,Big Bang Theory,150,23
38799,Leonard,8," And while you're at it, I know that at this age your hormones are raging, but just because all your friends are having sex doesn't mean you have to.",8,Big Bang Theory,149,29
38800,Sheldon,8, Why would you say that?,8,Big Bang Theory,24,5
38801,Leonard,8," You know, 'cause, 'cause a lot of people lose their virginity on prom night.",8,Big Bang Theory,77,14
38802,Sheldon,8, Penny implied the same thing. Is this true?,8,Big Bang Theory,44,8
38803,Leonard,8," Just relax, it's a joke. You don't have hormones.",8,Big Bang Theory,50,9
38805,Leonard,8," Wow, you look amazing.",8,Big Bang Theory,23,4
38806,Penny,8," Thank you, so do you.",8,Big Bang Theory,22,5
38807,Amy,8," Sheldon, you look so handsome.",8,Big Bang Theory,31,5
38808,Sheldon,8, Thank you.,8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
38809,Penny,8," Sheldon, doesn't Amy look hot? That's got to put some starch in the upper flermin.",8,Big Bang Theory,83,15
38810,Amy,8, What's that?,8,Big Bang Theory,13,2
38811,Leonard,8," Oh, it's a scaly genital organ that grows between his shoulder blades. Try not to touch it when you're dancing.",8,Big Bang Theory,112,20
38812,Sheldon,8, Excuse me.,8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
38813,Amy,8, Where are you going?,8,Big Bang Theory,21,4
38814,Sheldon,8," I can't do this. And for your information, Leonard, the upper flermin doesn't grow between my shoulder blades, it grows out of the belly button on my neck.",8,Big Bang Theory,156,28
38815,Leonard,8," He's right, I was thinking of the lower flermin.",8,Big Bang Theory,49,9
38817,Raj,8," Ooh, I'll, uh, text Stuart, let him know we're close.",8,Big Bang Theory,54,10
38821,Howard,8, Do you like her because you both have red hair?,8,Big Bang Theory,48,10
38826,Raj,8," Hey, here comes Stuart and his date.",8,Big Bang Theory,37,7
38828,Howard,8," Oh, my God.",8,Big Bang Theory,12,3
38830,Howard,8, That's Jeanie.,8,Big Bang Theory,15,2
38833,Howard,8, Don't say it.,8,Big Bang Theory,14,3
38834,Raj,8, That's Howard's cousin that he had sex with.,8,Big Bang Theory,45,8
38835,Howard,8," She is my second cousin. We were 15, I just said, don't say it.",8,Big Bang Theory,64,14
38837,Howard,8, Raj.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
38838,Raj,8," It was our first date, there was an awkward silence. What was I supposed to say?",8,Big Bang Theory,81,16
38840,Penny,8," Oh, it's beautiful.",8,Big Bang Theory,20,3
38841,Leonard,8," Oh, the girls really did a nice job.",8,Big Bang Theory,37,8
38842,Penny,8," Aw, I know I wasn't into this before, but I'm so glad I get to take you to your first prom.",8,Big Bang Theory,92,21
38843,Leonard,8, What makes you think I didn't go to my prom? I went.,8,Big Bang Theory,53,12
38844,Penny,8," Well, who'd you go with?",8,Big Bang Theory,25,5
38845,Leonard,8, I took a little lady I like to call loneliness.,8,Big Bang Theory,48,10
38846,Penny,8, Aw.,8,Big Bang Theory,4,1
38847,Leonard,8," Oh, it's all right. We ended up having a threesome with her friend humiliation, so",8,Big Bang Theory,83,15
38848,Penny,8," Well, if I would have been there and saw you alone, I would've asked you to dance.",8,Big Bang Theory,83,17
38849,Leonard,8," No, you wouldn't have.",8,Big Bang Theory,23,4
38850,Penny,8," Well, you don't know that.",8,Big Bang Theory,27,5
38851,Leonard,8, It was before my growth spurt.,8,Big Bang Theory,31,6
38852,Penny,8," What, that already happened?",8,Big Bang Theory,29,4
38853,Leonard,8, Very funny.,8,Big Bang Theory,12,2
38854,Penny,8," Well, you wouldn't have asked me either.",8,Big Bang Theory,41,7
38855,Leonard,8, I would have asked you. In my head. On the way home. While I was having a good cry.,8,Big Bang Theory,84,19
38857,Amy,8," Sheldon, can I come in?",8,Big Bang Theory,24,5
38858,Sheldon,8, I don't think that's a good idea.,8,Big Bang Theory,34,7
38859,Amy,8, Why not?,8,Big Bang Theory,9,2
38860,Sheldon,8," According to an online message board, I may be having a panic attack. SoccerMom09 had similar symptoms. But to be fair, the twins were a real handful that day.",8,Big Bang Theory,160,29
38861,Amy,8, You're making me worry. What's going on?,8,Big Bang Theory,41,7
38862,Sheldon,8, What's going on is we're about to go to a prom. And there's a great deal of pressure on young couples like us to engage in what Mr. Bob Eubanks called making whoopee.,8,Big Bang Theory,167,33
38863,Amy,8, What pressure? All I said was you look handsome. Can you please open the door?,8,Big Bang Theory,79,15
38864,Sheldon,8, It's not just that. Leonard and Penny also made comments about it. And I'm not blind. Even I looked twice when I saw my posterior in these tuxedo pants.,8,Big Bang Theory,153,29
38868,Howard,8," So, my mother's okay with this?",8,Big Bang Theory,32,6
38870,Howard,8," â€˜Cause they have a weird, inappropriate relationship.",8,Big Bang Theory,56,7
38872,Raj,8, This is so messed up.,8,Big Bang Theory,22,5
38874,Howard,8, Why would you even come to this? Didn't you know I'd be here?,8,Big Bang Theory,62,13
38879,Howard,8, Yeah.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
38881,Howard,8, Yeah.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
38883,Penny,8," Well, I might not have asked you to dance then, but I will ask you now.",8,Big Bang Theory,72,16
38884,Leonard,8, There's no music.,8,Big Bang Theory,18,3
38885,Penny,8, I don't care. We'll make our own music.,8,Big Bang Theory,40,8
38886,Leonard,8," My God, who's the dork now? Thank you for wearing your flats.",8,Big Bang Theory,62,12
38887,Penny,8, Thank you for wearing your heels.,8,Big Bang Theory,34,6
38888,Leonard,8, Look at me. Dancing with the prettiest girl at the prom.,8,Big Bang Theory,57,11
38889,Penny,8, Want to take a picture of us and send it to your old friends in the chess club?,8,Big Bang Theory,80,18
38890,Leonard,8, I sent them a bikini shot of you years ago. This is nice. I kind of wish no one else was coming.,8,Big Bang Theory,97,22
38891,Penny,8," I know, me, too. But it will be fun to have a prom without all the drama.",8,Big Bang Theory,74,17
38894,Howard,8, Not until he stops humping his way up my family tree.,8,Big Bang Theory,54,11
38896,Amy,8," Sheldon, this is silly. I'm not missing another prom. I'm going upstairs now. Good-bye.",8,Big Bang Theory,88,14
38897,Sheldon,8, I really did think you looked pretty.,8,Big Bang Theory,38,7
38898,Amy,8, You did?,8,Big Bang Theory,9,2
38899,Sheldon,8, Yes. So much so that I started to panic.,8,Big Bang Theory,41,9
38900,Amy,8," Well, you can relax. Just because you think I look pretty doesn't mean we have to spend the night together.",8,Big Bang Theory,108,20
38901,Sheldon,8, Were you hoping we would because it's prom?,8,Big Bang Theory,44,8
38902,Amy,8, I'm always hoping. But tonight I just wanted to have a nice time with you. And maybe dance with someone who has arms.,8,Big Bang Theory,118,23
38903,Sheldon,8, Thank you for understanding.,8,Big Bang Theory,29,4
38904,Amy,8," Of course I understand. Sheldon, there's something else I've been wanting to say, but before I do, I just, I want you to know that you don't have to say it back. I know you're not ready, and I don't want you to say it just because social convention dictates",8,Big Bang Theory,258,50
38905,Sheldon,8," I love you, too.",8,Big Bang Theory,17,4
38906,Amy,8, You said it.,8,Big Bang Theory,13,3
38907,Sheldon,8, There's no denying I have feelings for you that can't be explained in any other way. I briefly considered that I had a brain parasite. But that seems even more farfetched. The only conclusion was love. I know what's happening. This is a panic attack. SoccerMom09 says to lie down with your feet elevated.,8,Big Bang Theory,305,54
38908,Amy,8, Okay.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
38909,Sheldon,8," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Just because I love you doesn't mean girls are allowed in my room.",8,Big Bang Theory,91,17
38911,Raj,8," Okay. Here we go, say cheese. Iskip) Say cheese. Iskip) Say cousin. Iskip) Say",8,Big Bang Theory,79,14
38914,Amy,9, This is an easy one. You love this guy.,8,Big Bang Theory,40,9
38915,Sheldon,9, Me.,8,Big Bang Theory,4,1
38916,Amy,9," Come on, he's an under-appreciated genius.",8,Big Bang Theory,43,6
38917,Sheldon,9, Still think it's me.,8,Big Bang Theory,21,4
38918,Amy,9," It's not you. Now think, there's a car named after him.",8,Big Bang Theory,56,11
38919,Sheldon,9," Of course there is. The Mini Cooper, 'cause it's me.",8,Big Bang Theory,53,10
38920,Amy,9," How about this, he's a poor man's Sheldon Cooper.",8,Big Bang Theory,50,9
38921,Sheldon,9," Oh, Tesla.",8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
38922,Penny,9, Hi.,8,Big Bang Theory,4,1
38923,Amy,9, Hello.,8,Big Bang Theory,7,1
38924,Sheldon,9," Hey, how did it go?",8,Big Bang Theory,20,5
38925,Leonard,9," Oh, not fun. The doctor shoved a camera up into my sinuses.",8,Big Bang Theory,60,12
38926,Penny,9," Yeah, I watched. It was like the scary boat tunnel in Willy Wonka.",8,Big Bang Theory,67,13
38927,Amy,9, Did they figure out what's wrong?,8,Big Bang Theory,34,6
38928,Leonard,9, Yeah. It's a deviated septum. The surgery to correct it is simple. He's gonna do it next week.,8,Big Bang Theory,95,18
38929,Sheldon,9, Why would you have surgery?,8,Big Bang Theory,28,5
38930,Leonard,9," Because I can't breathe. I snore, I get sinus infections.",8,Big Bang Theory,58,10
38931,Penny,9," Yeah, back off, he's all mine.",8,Big Bang Theory,31,6
38932,Sheldon,9, But you don't have a life-threatening condition. Why would you take the risk of surgery?,8,Big Bang Theory,89,15
38933,Amy,9," Sheldon, it's a routine procedure, I've heard you complain about his snoring.",8,Big Bang Theory,78,12
38934,Sheldon,9," Yes, for the first five or six years, but I've gotten used to it. It helps me sleep. He's like my mucus-powered white noise machine.",8,Big Bang Theory,133,25
38935,Leonard,9," Sheldon, I'm gonna get the surgery, it's no big deal. End of story.",8,Big Bang Theory,68,13
38936,Sheldon,9, Very well. I'm done talking about it.,8,Big Bang Theory,38,7
38937,Leonard,9, Thank you.,8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
38938,Sheldon,9, I believe it was your turn in the game.,8,Big Bang Theory,40,9
38939,Amy,9, Okay.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
38940,Sheldon,9," Let's see. Oh, this person is most famous for never having gotten his nose mutilated with elective surgery and never living the rest of his life in the shadows as a hideous, disfigured freak.",8,Big Bang Theory,192,34
38941,Leonard,9, I think you could give a better clue.,8,Big Bang Theory,38,8
38942,Sheldon,9, I don't. I'm not even sure if that's a person or a typo.,8,Big Bang Theory,57,13
38944,Leonard,9," Okay, why?",8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
38945,Sheldon,9, I'm listening to you snore. I'm wondering how I'll ever sleep without it.,8,Big Bang Theory,74,13
38946,Leonard,9," If it helps you sleep, then why are you sitting here staring at me like the albino boogeyman?",8,Big Bang Theory,94,18
38947,Sheldon,9," Really Leonard. Insults? After I spent two hours in your closet, waiting for you to fall asleep?",8,Big Bang Theory,97,17
38948,Leonard,9, What's your problem?,8,Big Bang Theory,21,3
38949,Sheldon,9," If the surgery is successful, the snoring is gone. And if you die during surgery, the snoring is gone.",8,Big Bang Theory,103,19
38950,Leonard,9," It sounds like either way, I finally get some rest.",8,Big Bang Theory,52,10
38951,Sheldon,9," I have to be honest with you Leonard, I'm truly worried.",8,Big Bang Theory,57,11
38952,Leonard,9," I told you, there's nothing to worry about.",8,Big Bang Theory,44,8
38953,Sheldon,9," Well, I've been doing some research and I've learned that one in 700,000 people die from general anaesthesia.",8,Big Bang Theory,110,18
38954,Leonard,9," Buddy, wh, do you realize that that also means 699,999 people don't die?",8,Big Bang Theory,73,13
38955,Sheldon,9, I suppose that's true. You're such a glass half-full kind of guy. I'm going to miss that.,8,Big Bang Theory,90,17
38957,Raj,9," Oh, so, my, uh, parents' 40th anniversary's coming up and I can't think of a thing to get them.",8,Big Bang Theory,96,19
38958,Howard,9," Damn, can you imagine being married to someone for 40 years?",8,Big Bang Theory,61,11
38960,Raj,9," Anyway, any ideas on a gift?",8,Big Bang Theory,29,6
38962,Raj,9," They used to like going to the Mumbai Symphony, but last year my mom thought they were phoning it in. Then my dad said based on their love life, she should know about phoning it in.",8,Big Bang Theory,182,36
38964,Raj,9," Well, they weren't speaking at the time, so he had a servant say it to her. Oh, maybe I could make a gift for them. I know how much you guys love the coasters I made for you.",8,Big Bang Theory,175,38
38967,Leonard,9, Hey. What're you working on?,8,Big Bang Theory,29,5
38968,Sheldon,9," Remember when I said if you went through with your surgery, there was a one-in-700,000 chance of dying?",8,Big Bang Theory,104,18
38969,Leonard,9, Yeah?,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
38970,Sheldon,9," Well, I've been crunching the numbers, and so far, I've gotten your probability of death all the way to a sphincter-tightening one in 300.",8,Big Bang Theory,139,24
38971,Leonard,9, Great timing. My check sphincter light just went on.,8,Big Bang Theory,53,9
38972,Sheldon,9," Leonard, what if you have an allergic reaction to the surgeon's latex gloves?",8,Big Bang Theory,78,13
38973,Leonard,9, I'm not allergic to latex.,8,Big Bang Theory,27,5
38974,Sheldon,9," Well, then why don't you wear the rubber gloves I bought for you to do the dishes?",8,Big Bang Theory,83,17
38975,Leonard,9, For the same reason I don't wear the apron or the hair net.,8,Big Bang Theory,60,13
38976,Sheldon,9, Fine. What about epilepsy?,8,Big Bang Theory,27,4
38977,Leonard,9," I don't have epilepsy, either.",8,Big Bang Theory,31,5
38978,Sheldon,9," You don't, but the surgeon might, hmm? And your carotid artery is just one shaky scalpel away from becoming the dancing fountain at Disneyland.",8,Big Bang Theory,144,24
38979,Leonard,9," Sheldon, do you realize that driving is riskier than surgery?",8,Big Bang Theory,62,10
38980,Sheldon,9," I do. I have the drive to the hospital right here. That is if you make it to the car without falling down the stairs. And don't expect me to carry you, I do that enough in life.",8,Big Bang Theory,178,38
38981,Leonard,9," Buddy, I, I get that you're worried about me and I, I appreciate that, but I'm not going to die.",8,Big Bang Theory,97,20
38982,Sheldon,9, You don't know that.,8,Big Bang Theory,21,4
38983,Leonard,9," Well, I do know that it won't be from an asteroid strike.",8,Big Bang Theory,58,12
38984,Sheldon,9, You know who else said that? Every cocky T. Rex currently swimming around in the gas tank of your car.,8,Big Bang Theory,103,20
38985,Leonard,9," If there was an asteroid strike, wouldn't you die, too?",8,Big Bang Theory,56,10
38986,Sheldon,9," I don't know, I'm smart and scrappy, I think I'd find a way.",8,Big Bang Theory,61,13
38987,Leonard,9," Tell you what, the surgery's not for a week, I'll think about it.",8,Big Bang Theory,66,13
38988,Sheldon,9," Thank you. And while you're thinking about it, if you have the surgery in Nicaragua during monsoon season, I can practically guarantee your death.",8,Big Bang Theory,147,24
38990,Raj,9," Yes. Okay. I, I understand. Of course, yes. I'll call you tomorrow. Bye.",8,Big Bang Theory,73,13
38991,Howard,9," So I found this fencing school in Burbank that has a Jedi class. And if you're cool being the only adults there, they said they are.",8,Big Bang Theory,133,26
38992,Raj,9," Dude, my parents just split up.",8,Big Bang Theory,32,6
38993,Howard,9, What?,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
38994,Raj,9," Uh, that was my dad on the phone. He moved out.",8,Big Bang Theory,48,11
38995,Howard,9," Oh, my God, I, I'm sorry. I mean, if you're not up to it, we don't have to go out, we can just hang here.",8,Big Bang Theory,106,25
38996,Raj,9," No, it's fine. It's not that big a deal. As long as they're happy, I'm happy. And when I get to see them for the holidays, I'll get to celebrate Diwali twice, one at each house. That's double the Diwali.",8,Big Bang Theory,204,40
38997,Howard,9, You sure you're okay?,8,Big Bang Theory,22,4
38998,Raj,9, I'm okay.,8,Big Bang Theory,10,2
38999,Howard,9, You don't look okay.,8,Big Bang Theory,21,4
39000,Raj,9, How can I be okay? I come from a broken home.,8,Big Bang Theory,46,11
39002,Leonard,9, The doctor said I should be out of surgery by ten.,8,Big Bang Theory,51,11
39003,Penny,9, Okay. And Sheldon really believes we're at a public swimming pool?,8,Big Bang Theory,67,11
39004,Leonard,9," He was so busy figuring out how many parts per million of urine we'd be floating around in, he didn't even question it.",8,Big Bang Theory,120,23
39006,Sheldon,9, 18 parts per million. And he's still doing it.,8,Big Bang Theory,47,9
39007,Amy,9, Don't worry about that. I'm happy to take you to work.,8,Big Bang Theory,55,11
39008,Sheldon,9," Well, thank you. And Leonard never lets me have French toast sticks in the car. I can't have syrupy fingers, but he can do the backstroke in a toilet bowl.",8,Big Bang Theory,156,30
39009,Amy,9, It's nice they're getting exercise.,8,Big Bang Theory,36,5
39010,Sheldon,9," Although now that I think about it, Leonard would never go swimming in public without his swim shirt.",8,Big Bang Theory,102,18
39011,Amy,9, I'm sure he brought it.,8,Big Bang Theory,24,5
39012,Sheldon,9," No, but last year, at Magic Mountain, he got such a bad sunburn, we had to cut him out of it.",8,Big Bang Theory,94,21
39013,Amy,9," He probably got a new one. Finish your breakfast. Look, there's an entire section of my dashboard that doesn't have any syrup on it.",8,Big Bang Theory,133,24
39014,Sheldon,9, You're acting odd. Why?,8,Big Bang Theory,24,4
39015,Amy,9," I'm odd all the time, everyone knows that. Just last night I tried to see how many fava beans I could fit in my mouth.",8,Big Bang Theory,119,25
39016,Sheldon,9, Tell me the truth.,8,Big Bang Theory,19,4
39017,Amy,9, Twenty eight.,8,Big Bang Theory,14,2
39018,Sheldon,9, Come on.,8,Big Bang Theory,9,2
39019,Amy,9, Fifty six.,8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
39020,Sheldon,9, Amy. What's going on?,8,Big Bang Theory,22,4
39021,Amy,9," All right. Don't get upset, but, an earlier appointment opened up for Leonard and he's getting the surgery right now.",8,Big Bang Theory,118,20
39022,Sheldon,9, I see. Take me to Leonard.,8,Big Bang Theory,27,6
39023,Amy,9," Just go to work, he'll be fine.",8,Big Bang Theory,32,7
39024,Sheldon,9," Amy, he's my best friend, and if you don't take me, I'm going there anyway.",8,Big Bang Theory,76,15
39025,Amy,9, Fine. It's sweet that you care about him so much.,8,Big Bang Theory,50,10
39026,Sheldon,9, I do. And I wouldn't be able to forgive myself if something happened to him and I wasn't at his bedside to say I told you so.,8,Big Bang Theory,126,27
39028,Sheldon,9, Hello.,8,Big Bang Theory,7,1
39029,Penny,9, We had a really nice swim.,8,Big Bang Theory,27,6
39030,Sheldon,9," Oh, stop it. I assume this medical centre's already treated the burns on your bottom from the recent pants fire.",8,Big Bang Theory,113,20
39031,Penny,9," â€˜Cause I'm a liar, liar?",8,Big Bang Theory,27,5
39032,Sheldon,9, That's for the fire marshal to determine.,8,Big Bang Theory,42,7
39033,Penny,9, You had to tell him?,8,Big Bang Theory,21,5
39034,Amy,9," He wore me down. And I was distracted, he has on extra baby powder today.",8,Big Bang Theory,74,15
39035,Sheldon,9, Is he okay?,8,Big Bang Theory,12,3
39036,Penny,9, He's still in surgery.,8,Big Bang Theory,23,4
39037,Sheldon,9, Very well.,8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
39038,Penny,9, He's gonna be all right. That is sticky.,8,Big Bang Theory,41,8
39039,Amy,9," Come on, let's talk about something other than the surgery.",8,Big Bang Theory,60,10
39040,Sheldon,9," That's a good idea. Penny, did you and Leonard ever discuss funeral arrangements?",8,Big Bang Theory,82,13
39041,Penny,9, I think she meant something a little happier.,8,Big Bang Theory,46,8
39042,Sheldon,9," I suppose we could try to make it a celebration, but he died so young.",8,Big Bang Theory,71,15
39044,Howard,9," Knock, knock.",8,Big Bang Theory,14,2
39046,Raj,9, Hey. What brings you by?,8,Big Bang Theory,25,5
39048,Howard,9," Told you, not funny.",8,Big Bang Theory,21,4
39050,Raj,9, I'm sorry. This is very sweet. Thanks.,8,Big Bang Theory,39,7
39051,Howard,9," So, how you doing?",8,Big Bang Theory,19,4
39052,Raj,9, Better. I guess the news just hit me a lot harder than I expected.,8,Big Bang Theory,67,14
39054,Howard,9, Why? Your father barely speaks to your mother.,8,Big Bang Theory,47,8
39056,Howard,9," As you can see, we're here to cheer you up.",8,Big Bang Theory,44,10
39058,Raj,9," I think, over time, they started to resent each other, and instead of talking about the things that bothered them, they kept it bottled up, and the hate just grew.",8,Big Bang Theory,164,30
39061,Penny,9," Oh, it's nice you got him that.",8,Big Bang Theory,32,7
39062,Sheldon,9," Oh, this isn't for Leonard, no. Amy bought it for me.",8,Big Bang Theory,54,11
39063,Amy,9, Stubbed his toe on the revolving door on the way in.,8,Big Bang Theory,53,11
39064,Sheldon,9, You know those confounded things make me dizzy.,8,Big Bang Theory,48,8
39065,Amy,9, Who told you to keep going around?,8,Big Bang Theory,35,7
39066,Sheldon,9, There was a large plant in the lobby. It kept looking like the outside.,8,Big Bang Theory,72,14
39067,Penny,9," Okay, listen, when Leonard comes out, he is not gonna feel great, so, please don't give him a hard time.",8,Big Bang Theory,105,20
39068,Amy,9," Penny has a good point. This is like the man in the supermarket with the goiter on his neck. Whatever you're thinking, just keep it to yourself.",8,Big Bang Theory,145,27
39069,Sheldon,9, It was like a grapefruit.,8,Big Bang Theory,26,5
39070,Amy,9, And I'm sure he knew that before you held a grapefruit up next to it.,8,Big Bang Theory,70,15
39071,Sheldon,9," Well, I'm not making any promises. Not only did Leonard take what I feel is an unnecessary risk, he deceived me.",8,Big Bang Theory,113,21
39072,Penny,9," Okay, the reason he deceived you is you were being a pain in the ass.",8,Big Bang Theory,70,15
39073,Sheldon,9," The reason I was being a pain in the B is because I was worried about him, and no one else was.",8,Big Bang Theory,96,22
39074,Penny,9, Really? You won't even say A?,8,Big Bang Theory,30,6
39075,Sheldon,9, You bet your sweet B I won't.,8,Big Bang Theory,30,7
39076,Penny,9," Obviously, I care about Leonard. I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with him.",8,Big Bang Theory,79,15
39077,Sheldon,9, And I'm not? It's an earthquake. I knew it.,8,Big Bang Theory,44,9
39078,Penny,9," Sheldon, it was just a little tremor.",8,Big Bang Theory,38,7
39079,Sheldon,9," A little tremor that turns routine sinus surgery into a frontal lobotomy. Oh, I don't care for this at all. Oh, I need to see he's okay.",8,Big Bang Theory,137,27
39080,Amy,9," Sheldon, you can't go back there.",8,Big Bang Theory,34,6
39081,Sheldon,9, Try and stop me.,8,Big Bang Theory,17,4
39082,Amy,9, Are you okay?,8,Big Bang Theory,14,3
39083,Sheldon,9, Why didn't you stop me?,8,Big Bang Theory,24,5
39086,Howard,9, What are you talking about? We're fine. And Raj's parents probably split up because of Raj.,8,Big Bang Theory,92,16
39088,Howard,9," They always say the children aren't to blame, but, come on.",8,Big Bang Theory,60,11
39090,Howard,9, How can I convince you it won't?,8,Big Bang Theory,33,7
39092,Howard,9, I'm not answering that. It's a trap.,8,Big Bang Theory,37,7
39094,Howard,9, And here I am in the trap. You just keep talking. I'm gonna chew my leg off.,8,Big Bang Theory,77,17
39096,Howard,9," Okay. The truth is, sometimes, you're too beautiful.",8,Big Bang Theory,53,8
39098,Howard,9," Okay, okay. I really don't like how your wings poke me when we sleep 'cause you're an angel.",8,Big Bang Theory,93,18
39100,Howard,9," I just don't think the secret to a happy marriage is going out of our way to criticize each other. Although, there are ways to improve our communication. One thing I learned when I was in couples therapy was",8,Big Bang Theory,208,39
39102,Howard,9, Not important.,8,Big Bang Theory,15,2
39104,Howard,9, Not important.,8,Big Bang Theory,15,2
39106,Howard,9," Anyway, the therapist had us tell each other what we loved about one another.",8,Big Bang Theory,78,14
39108,Howard,9, All right.,8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
39110,Howard,9, Thank you. And I love that you're strong and independent.,8,Big Bang Theory,58,10
39112,Howard,9," I love that I'm kind of a slob around here, and you're okay with that.",8,Big Bang Theory,71,15
39114,Howard,9," See, I am. Isn't this great?",8,Big Bang Theory,29,6
39116,Penny,9," Come on, smile. This is gonna be my Christmas card.",8,Big Bang Theory,52,10
39117,Sheldon,9, You know this is all your fault.,8,Big Bang Theory,33,7
39118,Leonard,9, How is it my fault?,8,Big Bang Theory,20,5
39119,Sheldon,9, I told you not to get the surgery.,8,Big Bang Theory,35,8
39120,Leonard,9," Okay, first of all, the surgery was a success, and secondly, I didn't even want you there.",8,Big Bang Theory,91,17
39121,Sheldon,9," Wow. I don't know which hurts worse, my nose or my heart. Well, I'm done speaking to you.",8,Big Bang Theory,90,18
39122,Amy,9, Don't be like that. You two need to talk this out.,8,Big Bang Theory,51,11
39123,Penny,9," Yeah, 'cause you sound really funny.",8,Big Bang Theory,37,6
39124,Leonard,9," Sheldon, I'm sorry I didn't tell you about the surgery, but you were worried about nothing.",8,Big Bang Theory,92,16
39125,Sheldon,9," Oh, you're hardly out of the woods, no. You still run the risk of infection, a blood clot, the possibility that an inattentive surgeon let a barn spider lay eggs in your nose. The minute you sneeze web, I'm moving out.",8,Big Bang Theory,219,41
39126,Leonard,9," I never thought I'd say these words, but come on, nose spider.",8,Big Bang Theory,63,12
39127,Penny,9," Who are you kidding? You were so panicked Leonard was gonna die, you'll never leave him.",8,Big Bang Theory,89,16
39128,Amy,9, Sheldon will move out eventually.,8,Big Bang Theory,34,5
39129,Penny,9," Yeah, once he figures out how to work a door.",8,Big Bang Theory,46,10
39130,Sheldon,9," I was not panicked, and I am not overly attached to Leonard.",8,Big Bang Theory,61,12
39131,Leonard,9, You were so worried that you smashed your face trying to check on me. You love me.,8,Big Bang Theory,83,17
39132,Sheldon,9," Yeah. Tell me those aren't the words of a man with a spider eating its way through his brain. Amy, you're a neuroscientist. Crack his skull open, spray some Raid in there.",8,Big Bang Theory,172,32
39135,Howard,9, I love that you're too good to pee in the kitchen sink.,8,Big Bang Theory,56,12
39137,Howard,9, And I love how your hair is always on the soap. It's like washing myself with a hamster.,8,Big Bang Theory,89,18
39138,Raj,9," Hey, guys. Sorry I am so late. I was on the phone with my mother.",8,Big Bang Theory,66,15
39140,Raj,9," Pretty good. She bought the book Eat, Pray, Love and used it to set my father's Mercedes on fire. So, what's up with you guys?",8,Big Bang Theory,127,25
39141,Howard,9, We're just saying all the things we love about each other.,8,Big Bang Theory,59,11
39142,Raj,9," Oh, like you and I did at couples therapy.",8,Big Bang Theory,43,9
39144,Leonard,9," Oh, what'd you get?",8,Big Bang Theory,20,4
39145,Sheldon,9," Oh, I ordered it before your surgery. It's the urn I was going to put you in.",8,Big Bang Theory,78,17
39146,Penny,9," Okay, that's morbid. Send it back.",8,Big Bang Theory,35,6
39147,Sheldon,9," I can't send it back, I had it engraved. Here lie the ashes of Leonard Hofstadter. He thought he was right, but his room mate knew better.â€ù",8,Big Bang Theory,142,27
39148,Leonard,9," That's funny. Boy, I'm gonna miss these painkillers.",8,Big Bang Theory,53,8
39149,Penny,9," Hey, why did you get two? I'm with stupid.",8,Big Bang Theory,43,9
39150,Sheldon,9," Oh, that one's mine.",8,Big Bang Theory,21,4
39152,Sheldon,10," Hello. I'm Doctor Sheldon Cooper, and welcome to Sheldon Cooper presents Fun with Flags, the final episode flagtacular. I knew it was coming. Still scary. Now, I'm sure you're thinking, the final episode? Who will stand between us and flag ignorance?",8,Big Bang Theory,251,41
39153,Amy,10, I know I was thinking that. Is this a show on flags or mind reading?,8,Big Bang Theory,69,15
39154,Sheldon,10," But the truth is I can no longer balance a full-time career, a popular Internet show, and a girlfriend.",8,Big Bang Theory,104,19
39155,Amy,10," And he really does have one, you jerks on the comment board.",8,Big Bang Theory,61,12
39156,Sheldon,10," So as they say, all good things must come to an end.",8,Big Bang Theory,53,12
39157,Amy,10, After only 232 episodes.,8,Big Bang Theory,25,4
39158,Sheldon,10, 233 if we include the one somebody forgot to press record on.,8,Big Bang Theory,62,12
39159,Amy,10, You said you weren't gonna bring that up.,8,Big Bang Theory,42,8
39160,Sheldon,10," And you said you pressed record. Anyway, please sit back, relax, and join us as we take our final lap, as indicated by the waving of this racing flag. And, of course, white flags can also represent surrender, the Stewards of Gondor, and the Japanese Minamoto clan, but I'm sure you remember that from episode sixty-two, White Flags, Who's Wavin' â€˜Em and Why?",8,Big Bang Theory,361,63
39161,Amy,10, That was a good one.,8,Big Bang Theory,21,5
39162,Sheldon,10, It was so good.,8,Big Bang Theory,16,4
39164,Raj,10," You know, I thought cleaning out a dead professor's office was gonna just be boring, but then I found his dentures and realized it's also gross.",8,Big Bang Theory,145,26
39165,Howard,10, Doesn't Professor Abbott's family want any of this stuff?,8,Big Bang Theory,58,9
39166,Leonard,10, I don't think he had a family.,8,Big Bang Theory,31,7
39167,Raj,10, That's rough.,8,Big Bang Theory,14,2
39168,Leonard,10," I know. You can spend your whole life working, and at the end all that's left are some papers in a box.",8,Big Bang Theory,104,22
39169,Howard,10," Makes you think. Oh, well.",8,Big Bang Theory,27,5
39170,Leonard,10," Hey. Hey, we're supposed to look through all this stuff before we throw it away in case it's important.",8,Big Bang Theory,104,19
39171,Howard,10, I did. It's all outdated or disproved.,8,Big Bang Theory,39,7
39172,Raj,10," I don't know. This old pen kind of proves gravity. When I tilt it, her bathing suit falls right off.",8,Big Bang Theory,101,20
39173,Howard,10," Oh, my dad used to have a pen like that. I dated it all through sixth grade.",8,Big Bang Theory,77,17
39174,Leonard,10, It still feels weird just throwing away his work like this.,8,Big Bang Theory,60,11
39175,Howard,10," Don't feel bad. Someday someone will be throwing out your work, too.",8,Big Bang Theory,69,12
39176,Leonard,10," That someone was Sheldon, and the day was yesterday. Hey, look at this. Dear Roger, to be opened upon your first great discovery. Love, Mom. Wow, look at the date. He saved this fifty years and never got to open it.",8,Big Bang Theory,216,41
39177,Howard,10, That's intense.,8,Big Bang Theory,16,2
39178,Raj,10, Poor Roger Abbott.,8,Big Bang Theory,19,3
39179,Howard,10, Roger Abbott sounds just like Roger Rabbit.,8,Big Bang Theory,44,7
39180,Raj,10," Roger Abbott, Roger Abbott, Roger Abbott. Oh, my God, Leonard, I know he's dead, but try it. It's fun. Roger Abbott, Roger Abbott.",8,Big Bang Theory,131,23
39183,Penny,10," Oh, Dan. My boss who didn't want to hire me and now's a little hug machine.",8,Big Bang Theory,76,16
39185,Penny,10, Aw.,8,Big Bang Theory,4,1
39187,Penny,10, I'll be right there. Bernadette's just parking the car.,8,Big Bang Theory,56,9
39189,Penny,10, Come on. She's not that bad.,8,Big Bang Theory,29,6
39191,Penny,10," I know she can be a little intense, but, I swear, she is so sweet once you get past all the",8,Big Bang Theory,92,21
39193,Penny,10, Oh. We were just talking about how much we love working with you. Isn't that right? Dan?,8,Big Bang Theory,89,17
39195,Sheldon,10," Over the years here at Fun With Flags, we've had an opportunity to learn, laugh, wonder.",8,Big Bang Theory,89,16
39196,Amy,10," And, yes, even shed a tear or two.",8,Big Bang Theory,35,8
39197,Sheldon,10, Like when you do a two-hour Fourth of July spectacular and it doesn't get recorded.,8,Big Bang Theory,84,15
39198,Amy,10, How many times do I have to say I'm sorry?,8,Big Bang Theory,43,10
39199,Sheldon,10, How about four thousand. One for every domino I set up to make that American flag. Please enjoy these highlights.,8,Big Bang Theory,114,20
39200,Sheldon,10," Crikey, what flag do we have today?",8,Big Bang Theory,36,7
39201,Amy,10," Australia, mate.",8,Big Bang Theory,17,2
39202,Sheldon,10, And now it's time for the speed round of Flag or Not a Flag.,8,Big Bang Theory,61,14
39204,Amy,10," Say, Betsy Ross, what you working on?",8,Big Bang Theory,38,7
39205,Sheldon,10, I have no idea. Because the story of me sewing the first American flag is unsupported poppycock.,8,Big Bang Theory,97,17
39206,Amy,10," Then who did sew it, hmm?",8,Big Bang Theory,26,6
39207,Sheldon,10, Don't ask me. I'm just a simple seamstress whose descendants are out to make a quick buck.,8,Big Bang Theory,91,17
39208,Sheldon,10," Fancy a dip, my dear?",8,Big Bang Theory,22,5
39209,Amy,10, I do.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,2
39210,Sheldon,10," Wait, that purple flag indicates that marine pests, such as jellyfish, are present.",8,Big Bang Theory,84,13
39211,Amy,10," Wow, that flag is a lifesaver.",8,Big Bang Theory,31,6
39212,Sheldon,10, No. This is. Stop looking at my legs.,8,Big Bang Theory,38,8
39215,Raj,10," When stuff like this gets me down, you know what I like to do?",8,Big Bang Theory,63,14
39216,Howard,10, Sing Hakuna Matata like an eight-year-old girl?,8,Big Bang Theory,48,7
39217,Raj,10," Wrong, smarty-pants. It's Everything Is Awesome from The Lego Movie.",8,Big Bang Theory,69,10
39218,Leonard,10, Look at these notebooks. They're full of pages and pages of data. He clearly spent years on this.,8,Big Bang Theory,98,18
39219,Howard,10, Mmm. It's just columns of random numbers. Toss it.,8,Big Bang Theory,51,9
39220,Leonard,10," Well, but what if this was a potential breakthrough for him? What if, what if this is the thing that would've finally let him open that bottle of champagne?",8,Big Bang Theory,157,29
39221,Raj,10," Maybe he didn't know what to pair champagne with. Strawberries, caviar, oysters. All good choices. Yeah, that look right there is why people eat before they come to your parties.",8,Big Bang Theory,179,30
39222,Leonard,10, This has to mean something.,8,Big Bang Theory,28,5
39223,Howard,10," Well, there's no discernible pattern that I can see, but it shouldn't be too hard to run the numbers and check.",8,Big Bang Theory,112,21
39224,Leonard,10," Well, maybe we can get some time on the supercomputer.",8,Big Bang Theory,55,10
39225,Howard,10, Sure. We could try multiple regressions with varying physical and experimental constants.,8,Big Bang Theory,90,12
39226,Leonard,10," Oh, we could run a pattern-matching algorithm against well-known unsolved physics problems.",8,Big Bang Theory,92,12
39227,Howard,10," Ooh, it might be a substitution cipher. We could start with basic cryptanalysis.",8,Big Bang Theory,81,13
39228,Raj,10, Or we could talk to this guy he used to share an office with.,8,Big Bang Theory,62,14
39229,Howard,10," Oh, let's do that.",8,Big Bang Theory,19,4
39230,Leonard,10," Because you don't know how to do cryptanalysis, do you?",8,Big Bang Theory,56,10
39231,Howard,10," Yeah, I'm not even sure if it's the right word.",8,Big Bang Theory,48,10
39233,Penny,10," So, Dan, you have a grandson. How old is he?",8,Big Bang Theory,45,10
39236,Penny,10, I heard he was being picked on by a mean kid.,8,Big Bang Theory,46,11
39240,Penny,10," Oh, I don't know. Maybe he didn't like the fact that you called his grandson a wuss.",8,Big Bang Theory,85,17
39242,Penny,10," Okay, look, I know what a good person you are, but sometimes people think you might come off a little harsh.",8,Big Bang Theory,109,21
39244,Penny,10," Yes, but once in a while, people think you're a little mean.",8,Big Bang Theory,61,12
39246,Penny,10," No. No, no, no. I think the cookie thing.",8,Big Bang Theory,42,9
39248,Amy,10, Action.,8,Big Bang Theory,8,1
39249,Sheldon,10," Welcome back. Our guest today is a returning fan favourite. He puts the reading in your rainbow, the Geordi in your La Forge, and the Kunta in your Kinte, Mr. LeVar Burton.",8,Big Bang Theory,173,32
39251,Sheldon,10," You do this, I delete your contact information.",8,Big Bang Theory,48,8
39253,Sheldon,10, While you watch me do it.,8,Big Bang Theory,26,6
39255,Sheldon,10," Well, since you're here, I'd like to get your opinion on something. In honour of Black History Month, I portrayed George Washington Carver in a loving tribute that my roommate called wildly racist. What do you think?  Hi. My name is George.",8,Big Bang Theory,241,42
39257,Sheldon,10," You heard him, Leonard. No, it's not racist.",8,Big Bang Theory,45,8
39259,Howard,10, Are we sure this is the place?,8,Big Bang Theory,31,7
39260,Raj,10, The doorman said this is the right building.,8,Big Bang Theory,45,8
39261,Leonard,10," I think if you're pulling up your pants, you're not a doorman. ",8,Big Bang Theory,64,12
39263,Leonard,10," Uh, I've been looking for a Professor Sharpe?",8,Big Bang Theory,46,8
39265,Leonard,10, Hi. We're from the university. We're trying to get some information about Professor Abbott.,8,Big Bang Theory,92,14
39266,Howard,10, We were cleaning out his office and found these books full of numbers.,8,Big Bang Theory,71,13
39267,Leonard,10, Any chance you know what it is?,8,Big Bang Theory,32,7
39269,Raj,10," I was thinking it might be some sort of interstellar coordinate system, maybe an updated version of Hubble's law. I keep seeing the number 90 repeating. That could be the angle of perturbation of a distant galaxy.",8,Big Bang Theory,214,37
39271,Leonard,10, Really?,8,Big Bang Theory,8,1
39273,Raj,10, Does it work?,8,Big Bang Theory,14,3
39274,Howard,10, Seriously?,8,Big Bang Theory,11,1
39275,Raj,10," Well, he could have been hit by a bus. You don't know.",8,Big Bang Theory,55,12
39277,Leonard,10," So, was there anything that Professor Abbott worked on during his life that came close to an accomplishment?",8,Big Bang Theory,109,18
39279,Raj,10," You were his colleague. How did your research turn out? Great. Hey, this is the apartment you get when you win a Nobel.",8,Big Bang Theory,120,23
39280,Raj,10," Well, you could be very frugal. I'm getting a little tired of everybody's sarcasm.",8,Big Bang Theory,83,14
39283,Penny,10," No. That's fine, but there's a difference between being tough and telling your friend her new pants look like a saggy diaper.",8,Big Bang Theory,126,22
39285,Penny,10," Yeah, you did. I felt so self-conscious, I had to return them.",8,Big Bang Theory,63,12
39287,Penny,10, You're doing it again.,8,Big Bang Theory,23,4
39289,Penny,10," Oh, come on, they don't hate you, all right? They're just a little intimidated. All you need to do is show everyone how sweet you really are.",8,Big Bang Theory,142,27
39291,Penny,10," No, come on. You are not going anywhere, all right? I am here for you, and we are gonna fix this together.",8,Big Bang Theory,107,22
39293,Penny,10, Even though your dress is ugly.,8,Big Bang Theory,32,6
39295,Sheldon,10," Well, my little flag-keteers, it looks like the last episode of Fun with Flags is at an end. If I could, I would run each and every one of you viewers up a flagpole and salute you. And if you touched the ground, burn you. I'd like to take a moment to personally thank Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler, who you may or may not know is the first woman to co-host a flag or banner-related Internet info-tainment show.",8,Big Bang Theory,403,78
39296,Amy,10," Take that, glass ceiling.",8,Big Bang Theory,26,4
39297,Sheldon,10," And if I may get serious for a moment, hosting this show has been one crazy ride. But with all its ups and downs, I wouldn't give it up for the world. Except for now, when I'm giving it up. Before I sign off, I'd, uh, I'd like to share with you all one last use for a white flag. It's good for times like this. Good night.",8,Big Bang Theory,323,68
39298,Amy,10," Cut. Sheldon, that was beautiful.",8,Big Bang Theory,34,5
39299,Sheldon,10, If you didn't press record,8,Big Bang Theory,27,5
39300,Amy,10, I pressed it.,8,Big Bang Theory,14,3
39302,Leonard,10," Well, that's it. That's the end of Roger Abbott.",8,Big Bang Theory,49,9
39303,Raj,10, And we still don't know who framed him.,8,Big Bang Theory,40,8
39304,Leonard,10, I still keep thinking about how an entire life can seemingly amount to nothing.,8,Big Bang Theory,80,14
39305,Howard,10," I guess the sad truth is, not everyone will accomplish something great. Some of us may just have to find meaning in the little moments that make up life.",8,Big Bang Theory,154,29
39306,Leonard,10, That's a nice way of looking at it.,8,Big Bang Theory,36,8
39307,Howard,10," Yeah for you, not for me. I went to space. I'm covered.",8,Big Bang Theory,56,12
39308,Leonard,10," You know what? This bottle was meant to celebrate an achievement. Let's make a pact. When one of us gets their first big breakthrough, we'll celebrate by opening this bottle of champagne and toasting Professor Abbott.",8,Big Bang Theory,218,36
39309,Howard,10, I love that.,8,Big Bang Theory,13,3
39310,Raj,10," Yeah, me, too.",8,Big Bang Theory,15,3
39311,Leonard,10," Then, of course, rubbing our success in Sheldon's face.",8,Big Bang Theory,56,9
39312,Raj,10," Oh, well, that's the best part.",8,Big Bang Theory,32,6
39313,Howard,10," Oh, yeah.",8,Big Bang Theory,10,2
39321,Penny,10, What?,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
39330,Penny,10, Yeah. It comes from the swear jar we put money in when you curse.,8,Big Bang Theory,66,14
39332,Penny,10," Uh, well, you know your private bathroom?",8,Big Bang Theory,42,7
39334,Penny,10, That was supposed to be for the whole floor.,8,Big Bang Theory,45,9
39338,Penny,10," Well, then, maybe you shouldn't have named her Wheelchair Kathy.",8,Big Bang Theory,65,10
39344,Penny,10, Because this company needs you.,8,Big Bang Theory,32,5
39349,Penny,10, See? You don't have to be mean to get what you want.,8,Big Bang Theory,53,12
39352,Leonard,10, Hey.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
39353,Sheldon,10, Hello.,8,Big Bang Theory,7,1
39354,Leonard,10, How come you're up so late?,8,Big Bang Theory,28,6
39355,Sheldon,10," I posted the last episode of Fun with Flags hours ago, and not a single person cared enough to comment. All that effort for nothing.",8,Big Bang Theory,133,25
39356,Leonard,10," Mm. I know how you feel. I spent the day throwing out a man's entire career, and all that's left is an old bottle of champagne and a naked lady pen that Raj took when he thought no one was looking.",8,Big Bang Theory,198,41
39357,Sheldon,10, It's not the same thing. I don't think you know how I feel at all.,8,Big Bang Theory,67,15
39358,Leonard,10, Sad?,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
39359,Sheldon,10, Hmm. You do get me. Someone left a comment.,8,Big Bang Theory,44,9
39360,Leonard,10, Yeah. What did they say?,8,Big Bang Theory,25,5
39361,Sheldon,10," Too bad your show is done. I kind of liked it. Leonard, did you hear that? Oh, the people are heartbroken. I can't take this away from the world. Fun with Flags is back.",8,Big Bang Theory,170,34
39362,Leonard,10, Congratulations.,8,Big Bang Theory,17,1
39363,Sheldon,10, Let's celebrate.,8,Big Bang Theory,17,2
39364,Leonard,10," Sheldon, that wasn't for you.",8,Big Bang Theory,30,5
39365,Sheldon,10," Oh, no, I'm not going to drink it. I just wanted to hear the pop. Yeah, I knew it was coming. Still scary.",8,Big Bang Theory,107,23
39367,Sheldon,10,  LeVar Burton?  LeVar Burton?  LeVar Burton?,8,Big Bang Theory,45,6
39369,Sheldon,10," You told me not to call, and I didn't know how else to give you the good news. Fun with Flags is back, and you can be in the next episode.",8,Big Bang Theory,139,31
39371,Sheldon,10," You, at least listen to the premise. Since you were born in Germany, I thought we could talk",8,Big Bang Theory,93,18
39373,Penny,11," Hey, how are things going with your parents?",8,Big Bang Theory,45,8
39374,Sheldon,11," You know, speaking of attorneys, if I ever needed a lawyer, I would not hire She-Hulk.",8,Big Bang Theory,87,16
39375,Penny,11," You know what? That was almost on topic. I'm gonna say good job, Sheldon.",8,Big Bang Theory,74,14
39376,Amy,11," Wait, She-Hulk's a lawyer?",8,Big Bang Theory,27,4
39377,Howard,11," Yeah, she works at a law firm in New York.",8,Big Bang Theory,43,10
39378,Sheldon,11," Yes, but she's the only monster at the firm. Between you, me and the wall, I think she's an affirmative action hire.",8,Big Bang Theory,117,22
39379,Raj,11," Anyway, Dad's gonna be here in town, so I won't be able to do Christmas dinner this year.",8,Big Bang Theory,90,18
39380,Amy,11," If you're not up to hosting Christmas dinner, I'm happy to do it. You can even bring your father.",8,Big Bang Theory,98,19
39381,Raj,11, That would be nice.,8,Big Bang Theory,20,4
39382,Amy,11," I've always wanted to do a traditional Victorian Christmas. Parlour games, goose and figgy pudding.",8,Big Bang Theory,100,15
39383,Sheldon,11," Ugh. English pudding. You get yourself all excited for pudding, and here comes a cake with raisins in it. I'm not going.",8,Big Bang Theory,121,22
39384,Amy,11, You're going.,8,Big Bang Theory,14,2
39385,Sheldon,11, Why do you hate me?,8,Big Bang Theory,20,5
39386,Amy,11, I don't hate you. I love you.,8,Big Bang Theory,30,7
39387,Sheldon,11," Well, you call it love, but it has a lot of raisins in it.",8,Big Bang Theory,59,14
39388,Raj,11," Amy, good luck getting these guys excited about a dinner with a theme. I gave up when no one cared about my Tom Hanks-giving.",8,Big Bang Theory,126,24
39390,Howard,11, I agree.,8,Big Bang Theory,9,2
39391,Leonard,11, Why not?,8,Big Bang Theory,9,2
39392,Penny,11," Me, too.",8,Big Bang Theory,9,2
39393,Raj,11, You guys suck.,8,Big Bang Theory,15,3
39395,Leonard,11," You know the best part of working in the clean room? No allergies. Check it out. Oh, that, that, that's a lot of oxygen.",8,Big Bang Theory,121,24
39396,Howard,11, We should get going to Amy's.,8,Big Bang Theory,30,6
39397,Leonard,11, Can you believe there was a time when we would have needed an array of giant Cherenkov telescopes to detect cosmic particles? And here we are building our own multi-wire detector like a couple of badasses.,8,Big Bang Theory,206,36
39398,Howard,11," I know. If we were still single, we'd be tripping over all that booty.",8,Big Bang Theory,71,14
39399,Leonard,11," Ladies do love a man dressed like a kitchen garbage bag. Oh, no.",8,Big Bang Theory,65,13
39400,Howard,11, How the hell did a pigeon get in here?,8,Big Bang Theory,39,9
39401,Leonard,11," You shut the loading doors, right?",8,Big Bang Theory,35,6
39402,Howard,11, I thought you did.,8,Big Bang Theory,19,4
39403,Leonard,11, Do you know what a disaster this is?,8,Big Bang Theory,37,8
39404,Howard,11," You mean 'cause this room isn't supposed to have dust in it, and we just let in a flying crap machine?",8,Big Bang Theory,103,21
39405,Leonard,11, What do we do? Should we call someone?,8,Big Bang Theory,39,8
39406,Howard,11, And tell them that we compromised all the equipment? Let's just get it out of here before anyone knows.,8,Big Bang Theory,104,19
39407,Leonard,11," Okay, how do we catch it?",8,Big Bang Theory,26,6
39408,Howard,11," Well, what if we turn off all the lights except for one, and it'll come to it.",8,Big Bang Theory,79,17
39409,Leonard,11, It's not a moth.,8,Big Bang Theory,17,4
39410,Howard,11, Don't yell at me. You're not gonna get any good ideas out of me if you're yelling.,8,Big Bang Theory,83,17
39411,Leonard,11," Okay, so if I remain calm, I'll get more gems like turn off the lights?",8,Big Bang Theory,72,15
39412,Howard,11," Great, we're turning on each other. That's just what the bird wants us to do.",8,Big Bang Theory,78,15
39414,Penny,11," So, Dr. Koothrappali, long flight?",8,Big Bang Theory,35,5
39416,Penny,11," Oh, that's rough.",8,Big Bang Theory,18,3
39418,Raj,11, Can we please talk about anything else?,8,Big Bang Theory,40,7
39420,Penny,11," Oh, great. Everything's good.",8,Big Bang Theory,30,4
39422,Penny,11," Yes, we did.",8,Big Bang Theory,13,3
39424,Raj,11, Dad.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
39426,Raj,11," Hey, Leonard. What's up? What? How did that happen? Yeah, okay. I'll be there as soon as I can. Sorry. I have to run to the university.",8,Big Bang Theory,136,27
39427,Amy,11, What's going on?,8,Big Bang Theory,17,3
39428,Raj,11, There's been a problem with an experiment. A bird got into the clean room.,8,Big Bang Theory,75,14
39430,Raj,11," Uh, no. You had a long flight. You stay here and relax.",8,Big Bang Theory,56,12
39432,Penny,11, You're just gonna leave him here?,8,Big Bang Theory,34,6
39434,Raj,11, Yup. Bye.,8,Big Bang Theory,10,2
39437,Sheldon,11," Yeah, I appreciate the ride.",8,Big Bang Theory,29,5
39439,Sheldon,11," Because in the last ten minutes, Santa came to town, kissed Mommy and ran Grandma over with a reindeer. I had a drunk uncle who did all those things. Nobody sings songs about him.",8,Big Bang Theory,180,34
39441,Sheldon,11," My uncle was accused of that, too. It turned out to be legal in Oklahoma.",8,Big Bang Theory,74,15
39443,Sheldon,11," Oh, we're not exchanging gifts.",8,Big Bang Theory,32,5
39445,Sheldon,11," Why should I? She knows that I don't like Christmas, and yet, every year, she forces me to celebrate it. Not only am I going to this foolish dinner against my will, at the Christmas tree lot, there was mistletoe, and she kissed me under it in public. Like we were the stars of a Tijuana sex show.",8,Big Bang Theory,297,58
39447,Sheldon,11," Yes, and she's not taking my feelings into account at all. Maybe it's time I teach her a lesson.",8,Big Bang Theory,97,19
39449,Sheldon,11," Hmm. It'd have to be something heinous, something that makes her as miserable as she's making me. Oh, I've got it. This is good.",8,Big Bang Theory,129,24
39451,Sheldon,11, I'm going to buy her a present.,8,Big Bang Theory,32,7
39453,Sheldon,11," With gift-giving, there's an implied social contract. If I show up tonight with a present, and she doesn't have one for me, she'll feel terrible.",8,Big Bang Theory,146,25
39455,Sheldon,11," Yes. Maybe she'll feel so guilty, she'll never make me celebrate the holidays again.",8,Big Bang Theory,85,14
39457,Sheldon,11," That's right. So stay on my good side, or I'll get you a little something, too.",8,Big Bang Theory,80,16
39459,Howard,11," Okay, here's the plan. I'm gonna put the food in the bag, and when he lands in the bag to eat it, we close it up.",8,Big Bang Theory,114,26
39460,Leonard,11, A Slim Jim?,8,Big Bang Theory,12,3
39461,Howard,11, It's all I could find. It'll work.,8,Big Bang Theory,35,7
39462,Leonard,11, Sure. If the pigeon's stoned or a trucker.,8,Big Bang Theory,43,8
39463,Howard,11," Okay, well, what's your plan?",8,Big Bang Theory,30,5
39464,Leonard,11, I told you my plan. Let's call Building Services and get help.,8,Big Bang Theory,63,12
39465,Howard,11, And admit that we contaminated the clean room?,8,Big Bang Theory,47,8
39466,Leonard,11," No, admit that you contaminated the clean room.",8,Big Bang Theory,48,8
39467,Howard,11, Why do you keep assuming it was me?,8,Big Bang Theory,36,8
39468,Leonard,11," Because you do this kind of thing all the time, and then you try to cover it up.",8,Big Bang Theory,81,18
39469,Howard,11, Like when?,8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
39470,Leonard,11," What about when you flipped the Mars Rover, or lost Koothrappali's dog, or almost drove off with that baby?",8,Big Bang Theory,108,19
39471,Howard,11," Again, it looked like my car, and the baby didn't even cry until his mother punched me with her keys.",8,Big Bang Theory,102,20
39472,Leonard,11," Fine, put the Slim Jim in the garbage bag.",8,Big Bang Theory,43,9
39473,Howard,11," Well, what if you said it without sounding so condescending?",8,Big Bang Theory,61,10
39474,Leonard,11," I can try, but your plan has the words garbage bag and Slim Jim in it.",8,Big Bang Theory,71,16
39475,Raj,11," Hey, what's going on?",8,Big Bang Theory,22,4
39476,Leonard,11, Oh. Genius here wants to catch a bird with a garbage bag and a Slim Jim.,8,Big Bang Theory,73,16
39477,Raj,11, Should have put it in the bag first.,8,Big Bang Theory,37,8
39479,Penny,11," So, if you don't mind me asking, do you think you might start dating again?",8,Big Bang Theory,76,15
39481,Penny,11," No, but if things don't work out with me and Leonard, I'll give you a call. Wait. How much do you talk about Star Trek?",8,Big Bang Theory,120,25
39482,Amy,11," Okay, let's get this Victorian party started. I've done some research about some traditional parlour games we can play.",8,Big Bang Theory,120,19
39483,Penny,11, Like what?,8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
39484,Amy,11," Well, there's a fun one called Ball of Wool. You take a ball of wool, and you put it right in the centre of the table. Then people sit on opposite sides of the table and try to blow the wool off.",8,Big Bang Theory,196,42
39485,Penny,11," Sorry. She's taken, too.",8,Big Bang Theory,25,4
39487,Howard,11, You know what I think your problem is? You're jealous because you and I used to be best friends until Koothrappali came along.,8,Big Bang Theory,127,23
39488,Leonard,11, And you found somebody you could push around?,8,Big Bang Theory,46,8
39489,Raj,11, Hey.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
39490,Howard,11, Stay out of this.,8,Big Bang Theory,18,4
39491,Raj,11, Okay.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
39492,Howard,11," You know, maybe I'm best friends with Raj because he doesn't think he's smarter than me.",8,Big Bang Theory,89,16
39493,Raj,11, Actually.,8,Big Bang Theory,10,1
39494,Howard,11," I said, stay out of it.",8,Big Bang Theory,24,6
39495,Leonard,11," No, no, no. No, Raj, go ahead, say what you were gonna say.",8,Big Bang Theory,60,13
39496,Raj,11," All I'm gonna say is you guys need to stop this right now. It. it's bad enough that my parents are fighting, now I have to hear the two of you? And who cares who's smarter? If it's Leonard or me or, you know, it's Christmas, let's say it's Howard.",8,Big Bang Theory,248,50
39497,Howard,11," Well, if you're so smart, you get the bird out.",8,Big Bang Theory,48,10
39498,Raj,11," No, you're the one who let him in.",8,Big Bang Theory,35,8
39499,Howard,11, How do you know it wasn't Leonard?,8,Big Bang Theory,35,7
39500,Raj,11, Come on.,8,Big Bang Theory,9,2
39503,Sheldon,11," No, it's not good enough. It has to be perfect.",8,Big Bang Theory,48,10
39505,Sheldon,11," Hmm. Let's see, what do I know about Amy? She loves medieval literature, Chaucer's her favourite. And her eyes sparkle when she watches old French movies. I enjoy how harp music causes her fingers to dance as if she's playing along.",8,Big Bang Theory,233,41
39507,Sheldon,11," I do. Now, let's find the kind of gift that makes her feel small and worthless.",8,Big Bang Theory,80,16
39509,Amy,11, You won.,8,Big Bang Theory,9,2
39510,Penny,11," Certainly doesn't feel like it, does it?",8,Big Bang Theory,41,7
39512,Penny,11," Oh, I guess that's where Raj gets it from.",8,Big Bang Theory,43,9
39514,Penny,11," Hey, you know, Raj is dating a doctor who works a lot. Him and his mom have a type. You, you got to laugh at that, right? No? All right.",8,Big Bang Theory,137,30
39517,Sheldon,11, Correct.,8,Big Bang Theory,9,1
39519,Sheldon,11, There's an argument for that. But I want to make sure.,8,Big Bang Theory,55,11
39523,Leonard,11," Okay. On the count of three, I'll shoot the fire extinguisher and get him airborne. Howard, you wave the blanket and guide him towards the exit. Raj, you hold open the curtain so he can fly out.",8,Big Bang Theory,195,37
39524,Howard,11, Are you sure a dummy like me can handle something as complicated as a blanket?,8,Big Bang Theory,79,15
39525,Leonard,11, Do you want the fire extinguisher?,8,Big Bang Theory,35,6
39526,Howard,11," Yeah, I do.",8,Big Bang Theory,12,3
39527,Leonard,11, Great. Here you go.,8,Big Bang Theory,20,4
39528,Howard,11," Okay. One, two, three.",8,Big Bang Theory,23,4
39529,Raj,11," Uh, you have to take the pin out.",8,Big Bang Theory,34,8
39530,Leonard,11," You miss the blanket now, don't you?",8,Big Bang Theory,37,7
39531,Howard,11," On three. One, two, three.",8,Big Bang Theory,27,5
39532,Raj,11, What did you do?,8,Big Bang Theory,17,4
39533,Howard,11," It was an accident. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.",8,Big Bang Theory,44,10
39534,Leonard,11," Relax, it wasn't your fault.",8,Big Bang Theory,29,5
39535,Howard,11," Uh, maybe it's just stunned.",8,Big Bang Theory,29,5
39536,Raj,11," Dude, it's not breathing.",8,Big Bang Theory,26,4
39537,Howard,11," Oh, no. I killed it. Oh, not again.",8,Big Bang Theory,36,8
39538,Raj,11," What do you mean, not again?",8,Big Bang Theory,29,6
39539,Howard,11," When I was ten, I was playing in my backyard and sat on a blue jay. I mean, I tried to bring it back to life with electricity, but it just caught on fire. The worst part was it smelled delicious.",8,Big Bang Theory,196,41
39540,Leonard,11," Uh, guys, I found an article here that says you can do CPR on birds.",8,Big Bang Theory,69,15
39541,Howard,11, Great. Do it.,8,Big Bang Theory,14,3
39542,Leonard,11," I'm not doing it. You killed him, you do it.",8,Big Bang Theory,45,10
39543,Raj,11, I'll do it.,8,Big Bang Theory,12,3
39544,Howard,11, No. I need to do it. This is on me.,8,Big Bang Theory,36,10
39545,Leonard,11, Okay. Mouth over beak and light chest compressions.,8,Big Bang Theory,52,8
39546,Raj,11," Don't blow too hard. If you pop him, I will vomit.",8,Big Bang Theory,51,11
39547,Leonard,11, Anything?,8,Big Bang Theory,10,1
39548,Howard,11, I am tasting a lot of Slim Jim.,8,Big Bang Theory,32,8
39549,Leonard,11," Wait, wait, his wing moved.",8,Big Bang Theory,28,5
39550,Howard,11," Oh, he blinked his eyes. He's alive.",8,Big Bang Theory,37,7
39551,Raj,11, It's a Christmas miracle.,8,Big Bang Theory,26,4
39552,Howard,11," I might argue a Hanukkah miracle, but I'll take it. Come on, little guy, let's get you outside. Get the curtain.",8,Big Bang Theory,113,21
39553,Raj,11, Someone should really close that loading door.,8,Big Bang Theory,47,7
39555,Raj,11," Well, that's that. The room's compromised. They'll have to change all the filters, probably shut it down for weeks.",8,Big Bang Theory,116,19
39556,Howard,11," You were right. Go ahead, call Building Services. Tell them it was my fault.",8,Big Bang Theory,77,14
39557,Leonard,11," No, we're both to blame. You know, let me take the heat on this one.",8,Big Bang Theory,69,15
39558,Raj,11," Yeah, just leave me out of it. You know if they come here and see crap everywhere, they're just gonna blame the Indian guy.",8,Big Bang Theory,124,24
39559,Leonard,11," Hey. I'm sorry, we're still here. Is everything okay?",8,Big Bang Theory,54,9
39560,Penny,11, It's kind of boring. Although it did get exciting for a minute when Amy inhaled a wool ball. How much longer do you think you'll be?,8,Big Bang Theory,133,26
39561,Leonard,11, I don't know. There's still a bird in here. We are gonna get in a ton of trouble.,8,Big Bang Theory,82,18
39562,Penny,11," Honey, it's Christmas Eve. Who even knows you're in there?",8,Big Bang Theory,59,10
39563,Leonard,11," No, our names are on the sign-in sheet.",8,Big Bang Theory,40,8
39564,Penny,11, So erase them and walk out.,8,Big Bang Theory,28,6
39565,Leonard,11, I can't do that.,8,Big Bang Theory,17,4
39566,Howard,11, Can't do what?,8,Big Bang Theory,15,3
39567,Leonard,11, She says take our names off the sign-in sheet and leave.,8,Big Bang Theory,57,11
39568,Howard,11, We can't do that.,8,Big Bang Theory,18,4
39569,Leonard,11, Yeah.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
39573,Raj,11," Mmm. Amy, that pudding was delicious.",8,Big Bang Theory,38,6
39574,Sheldon,11, If you like raisins.,8,Big Bang Theory,21,4
39575,Amy,11, Thank you. And it's figs.,8,Big Bang Theory,26,5
39576,Sheldon,11," Oh. Oh, in that case, it was pretty good.",8,Big Bang Theory,42,9
39578,Howard,11, It smelled too much like blue jay.,8,Big Bang Theory,35,7
39580,Amy,11," Oh, you Heimliched a ball of wool out of me; you're good.",8,Big Bang Theory,58,12
39581,Sheldon,11," Uh, what do you say we exchange gifts?",8,Big Bang Theory,39,8
39582,Penny,11," Oh, Sheldon, we didn't bring any.",8,Big Bang Theory,34,6
39583,Leonard,11, I thought you hate giving gifts.,8,Big Bang Theory,33,6
39584,Sheldon,11," Yeah, I do. Which is why I got Amy this.",8,Big Bang Theory,41,10
39585,Amy,11, You got me something?,8,Big Bang Theory,22,4
39586,Sheldon,11," Oh, not just something, no. It's from the heart, it's holiday-themed, and I swallowed the gift receipt so you cannot return it.",8,Big Bang Theory,128,22
39587,Amy,11, Look at you on Santa's lap. That's so sweet.,8,Big Bang Theory,45,9
39588,Sheldon,11, Of course it is. It's the perfect gift. How are you feeling right now? Guilty? Sad? Wishing you were Jewish?,8,Big Bang Theory,109,20
39589,Amy,11," No, I love it.",8,Big Bang Theory,15,4
39590,Sheldon,11," Oh, really? Well, how about now?  Happy holidays to my dear Amy. I hope you treasure this as much as I treasure you.  And you got me nothing. Christmas is ruined. Let's never speak of it again. Well, this was fun.",8,Big Bang Theory,214,41
39591,Amy,11," Actually, I did get you something.",8,Big Bang Theory,35,6
39592,Sheldon,11, But what about our agreement?,8,Big Bang Theory,30,5
39593,Amy,11," Well, you got me something. Here.",8,Big Bang Theory,34,6
39594,Sheldon,11, Cookies?,8,Big Bang Theory,9,1
39595,Amy,11, They're your Meemaw's Christmas cookies. I called and got the recipe.,8,Big Bang Theory,70,11
39596,Sheldon,11, They're perfect. It tastes like her hugs.,8,Big Bang Theory,42,7
39597,Amy,11," Merry Christmas, Sheldon.",8,Big Bang Theory,26,3
39598,Sheldon,11," I can't believe this. You're happy, I'm happy. Well, maybe a holiday that's all about giving isn't so Get your hand out of that box.",8,Big Bang Theory,133,25
39600,Amy,11, Okay. The next game is called Hot Boiled Beans.,8,Big Bang Theory,48,9
39601,Penny,11, Of course it is.,8,Big Bang Theory,17,4
39602,Amy,11," One person is sent out of the room while the others hide a small item. Then they invite the first person back by saying hot boiled beans and bacon for supper, hurry up before it gets cold.",8,Big Bang Theory,189,37
39603,Raj,11," If you people think this is better than Tom Hanks-giving, you're all crazy.",8,Big Bang Theory,76,13
39605,Sheldon,12, What colour would you like to be?,8,Big Bang Theory,34,7
39606,Leonard,12," Well, I'd like to be green, but you know you always take it.",8,Big Bang Theory,61,13
39607,Sheldon,12," That's not true. Any colour's fine with me. Yeah, I could be a-a combination of blue and yellow.",8,Big Bang Theory,97,18
39608,Leonard,12, Blue and yellow make green.,8,Big Bang Theory,28,5
39609,Sheldon,12," Well, then it's settled.",8,Big Bang Theory,25,4
39610,Penny,12, Hi. Ready to go?,8,Big Bang Theory,17,4
39611,Sheldon,12," Oh, good news, we ordered lunch, so we can all stay here and play Lord of the Rings Risk.",8,Big Bang Theory,90,19
39612,Amy,12," Sheldon, we said that we would play games with you tonight.",8,Big Bang Theory,60,11
39613,Sheldon,12," Oh, no, we'll still be playing it tonight, this game can easily take eight hours.",8,Big Bang Theory,82,15
39614,Penny,12," Sweetie, you really thought I'd want to do this?",8,Big Bang Theory,49,9
39615,Leonard,12, No.,8,Big Bang Theory,4,1
39616,Penny,12," Well, did you tell him that?",8,Big Bang Theory,29,6
39617,Leonard,12, Yes.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
39618,Penny,12, Did you say it out loud with words?,8,Big Bang Theory,36,8
39619,Leonard,12, No.,8,Big Bang Theory,4,1
39620,Penny,12, I don't want to spend the whole day playing a board game.,8,Big Bang Theory,58,12
39621,Sheldon,12," Yeah, well, you may change your mind when you hear that this is the new expanded edition which contains a more complete map of Middle Earth, now including the Haradwaith Territories.",8,Big Bang Theory,183,31
39622,Amy,12, I will literally race you to the car.,8,Big Bang Theory,38,8
39623,Leonard,12," No, no, no, come on, don't leave. Just try it.",8,Big Bang Theory,47,10
39624,Penny,12," No. We're always doing what you guys want. Just once, it'd be nice if you did something we wanted.",8,Big Bang Theory,99,19
39625,Sheldon,12, You want to be green?,8,Big Bang Theory,22,5
39626,Leonard,12," You know, they really have tried to like a lot of the same stuff we're into.",8,Big Bang Theory,77,16
39627,Penny,12," Yeah, we do game nights and video game nights and we watch movies with director's commentary.",8,Big Bang Theory,94,16
39628,Amy,12," Oh, my favourite, George Lucas can talk all the way through Star Wars, I say one word and I'm banished to the kitchen.",8,Big Bang Theory,119,23
39629,Penny,12," Yeah, today Amy and I are deciding what we're all gonna do.",8,Big Bang Theory,60,12
39630,Leonard,12," You got it, you girls are in charge.",8,Big Bang Theory,37,8
39631,Penny,12, Thank you.,8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
39632,Amy,12, Sheldon?,8,Big Bang Theory,9,1
39633,Sheldon,12," Fine. Now that we're not playing, you can be green.",8,Big Bang Theory,52,10
39634,Leonard,12, Thank you.,8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
39635,Sheldon,12," And since you're green this time, I can be it next time.",8,Big Bang Theory,57,12
39636,Penny,12," All right, let's see. What's something fun the guys would never take us to do? Oh, I know, we could go horseback riding.",8,Big Bang Theory,121,23
39637,Amy,12," I actually can't. My hips don't open wider than 22 degrees. I rode a very thin pony once. On the first bump, just popped right off.",8,Big Bang Theory,132,26
39638,Penny,12," All right, well, what do you want to do?",8,Big Bang Theory,41,9
39639,Amy,12, There's a craft and folk art museum on Wilshire.,8,Big Bang Theory,49,9
39640,Penny,12," Well, that's Wilshire's problem. Come on, you know, there, there's got to be something fun we could do that the guys will hate.",8,Big Bang Theory,128,23
39641,Leonard,12," Hang on, why do we have to hate it?",8,Big Bang Theory,36,9
39642,Penny,12," Three words, Doctor Who convention.",8,Big Bang Theory,36,5
39643,Leonard,12, I did not force you to go to that.,8,Big Bang Theory,35,9
39644,Penny,12, You walked out of the house in a fez and bow tie. I went so you didn't get beat up.,8,Big Bang Theory,84,20
39645,Leonard,12, I wasn't gonna get beat up.,8,Big Bang Theory,28,6
39646,Penny,12," You were, but somehow I held myself back.",8,Big Bang Theory,42,8
39647,Sheldon,12, You know what you could make us do? Ice-skating. The cold air will trigger Leonard's asthma and it plays right into my well-known fear of getting flattened by a Zamboni.,8,Big Bang Theory,170,30
39648,Leonard,12, Now you're helping them find ways to make us miserable?,8,Big Bang Theory,56,10
39649,Sheldon,12," Well, I'm sorry, Leonard, I'm a problem-solver, it's what I do.",8,Big Bang Theory,64,11
39650,Amy,12, I actually can't go ice-skating. I have unnaturally brittle ankles.,8,Big Bang Theory,68,10
39651,Penny,12, Is there any part of your body that's normal?,8,Big Bang Theory,46,9
39653,Raj,12," Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.",8,Big Bang Theory,36,9
39654,Howard,12, Will you please relax?,8,Big Bang Theory,23,4
39655,Raj,12," I can't take it, dude.",8,Big Bang Theory,23,5
39657,Raj,12," No, I'm not okay. I feel like I'm gonna jump out of my skin.",8,Big Bang Theory,61,14
39659,Raj,12, I'm worried about the New Horizons space probe.,8,Big Bang Theory,48,8
39661,Howard,12," Nine years ago he was part of a team that launched a spacecraft to collect data about Pluto, and it's finally close enough, so this morning it turned itself on.",8,Big Bang Theory,161,30
39662,Raj,12, We hope. The signal has to travel over three billion miles. So it's gonna be hours before we know if it even survived.,8,Big Bang Theory,119,23
39663,Howard,12, Now we get to see him flip out because he's worried it was demolished by space ice.,8,Big Bang Theory,84,17
39664,Raj,12, Space ice is no joke. I can't even watch Frozen anymore.,8,Big Bang Theory,57,11
39666,Amy,12," Ooh, the philharmonic is playing Beethoven downtown.",8,Big Bang Theory,53,7
39667,Sheldon,12," Before you say yes, it's not the movie about the big dog.",8,Big Bang Theory,58,12
39668,Penny,12, How come we can't think of something we both want to do?,8,Big Bang Theory,57,12
39669,Amy,12, Because you always pick what we do and I just go along with it.,8,Big Bang Theory,64,14
39670,Leonard,12," Ah, interesting, we're being accused of making you do things you don't like, and here you are, doing the same thing to poor Amy.",8,Big Bang Theory,129,24
39671,Sheldon,12, You should point out the hypocrisy of that.,8,Big Bang Theory,44,8
39672,Leonard,12, That's what I was doing.,8,Big Bang Theory,25,5
39673,Sheldon,12," Oh, that wasn't clear. Try it again, but this time drive it home with how do you like them apples, Missy?",8,Big Bang Theory,106,21
39674,Penny,12," All right, keep thinking.",8,Big Bang Theory,26,4
39675,Sheldon,12," You're making it too complicated. Why not stick to the basics? Go shopping for clothes while Leonard and I sit in those uncomfortable chairs and hold your purses, hmm? I know I'd hate that. Leonard?",8,Big Bang Theory,199,35
39676,Leonard,12," Well, yeah.",8,Big Bang Theory,12,2
39677,Sheldon,12," Well, then, it's settled?",8,Big Bang Theory,26,4
39678,Amy,12, What do you say? Sounds kind of perfect.,8,Big Bang Theory,41,8
39679,Penny,12," It does, somehow he managed to take all the fun out of it.",8,Big Bang Theory,59,13
39680,Sheldon,12," Well, once again, it's what I do.",8,Big Bang Theory,34,7
39682,Raj,12," Oh, another two hours to go. The wait is killing me.",8,Big Bang Theory,53,11
39683,Howard,12," I know. I get it. When I was in the Soyuz capsule returning from the space station, plummeting toward Earth at 17,000 miles per hour",8,Big Bang Theory,133,25
39684,Raj,12," Before you finish, is this a story about patience and waiting or just another reminder that you went to space?",8,Big Bang Theory,111,20
39685,Howard,12, A story can do two things.,8,Big Bang Theory,27,6
39686,Raj,12," Ugh, I feel like I'm gonna have a heart attack.",8,Big Bang Theory,48,10
39687,Howard,12," You work in pharmaceuticals, don't you have anything you can give him?",8,Big Bang Theory,71,12
39689,Raj,12, I can't stop thinking about it.,8,Big Bang Theory,32,6
39691,Raj,12, I know.,8,Big Bang Theory,8,2
39692,Howard,12, Maybe you need to do something more productive.,8,Big Bang Theory,48,8
39693,Raj,12," Okay. If I make this shot in the trash can, the probe will have arrived in perfect working order.",8,Big Bang Theory,98,19
39694,Howard,12," So, in addition to being crazy, you're resting the fate of the mission on your athletic prowess.",8,Big Bang Theory,97,17
39695,Raj,12, Yes.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
39696,Howard,12, The man who crashed his stationary bike.,8,Big Bang Theory,41,7
39697,Raj,12," I didn't crash it, okay? My playlist was too up-tempo, I got light-headed and I fell off. Okay. It all comes down to this.",8,Big Bang Theory,123,24
39698,Howard,12, You happy? Now you can relax.,8,Big Bang Theory,30,6
39699,Raj,12, What kind of scientist are you? Everyone knows you got to make two out of three.,8,Big Bang Theory,81,16
39701,Leonard,12, This isn't so bad.,8,Big Bang Theory,19,4
39702,Sheldon,12," That's easy for you to say. Your chair's not facing the lingerie section. Boy, that's a lot of panties.",8,Big Bang Theory,104,19
39703,Amy,12, You guys comfy? This might take a while.,8,Big Bang Theory,41,8
39704,Sheldon,12, I don't understand why women insist on making a big production out of buying clothes.,8,Big Bang Theory,86,15
39705,Penny,12," No, you're right, we should do what you do. Have our mom send us pants from the Walmart in Houston.",8,Big Bang Theory,100,20
39706,Sheldon,12, They have a man there who understands my personal style.,8,Big Bang Theory,57,10
39707,Penny,12, Bye.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
39708,Leonard,12," Uh, I've got some bad news. There's no cell service in here.",8,Big Bang Theory,61,12
39709,Sheldon,12," Oh. Well, that's all right. There were plenty of ways to pass the time before smart phones were invented.",8,Big Bang Theory,106,19
39710,Leonard,12, That's true.,8,Big Bang Theory,13,2
39711,Sheldon,12, I'll look them up. Son of a biscuit.,8,Big Bang Theory,37,8
39712,Leonard,12," Sheldon, it's fine.",8,Big Bang Theory,20,3
39713,Sheldon,12," No, it's not fine. What kind of store in the 21st century doesn't at least have Wi-Fi? I'm going to call their corporate office. Son of a biscuit.",8,Big Bang Theory,147,28
39715,Sheldon,12," Let's see, my armies are going to attack the Shire from Buckland. And I roll a five and a three.",8,Big Bang Theory,97,20
39716,Leonard,12," Okay. And to defend, I roll two sixes. I win.",8,Big Bang Theory,46,10
39717,Sheldon,12," Boy, double-sixes again. You know, if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn't believe it. I wonder how long we're gonna be stuck here.",8,Big Bang Theory,141,27
39718,Leonard,12," I don't know, but the girls do a lot for us. It's the least we can do.",8,Big Bang Theory,71,17
39719,Sheldon,12," Oh, that's true. I suppose it's only fair we make compromises.",8,Big Bang Theory,63,11
39720,Leonard,12," Look at you, being all mature.",8,Big Bang Theory,31,6
39721,Sheldon,12," I don't know why you're so surprised. If there's one thing I know about after living with you for so many years, it's how to compromise.",8,Big Bang Theory,137,26
39722,Leonard,12," I, I'm sorry? You make compromises for me?",8,Big Bang Theory,43,8
39723,Sheldon,12, All the time.,8,Big Bang Theory,14,3
39724,Leonard,12," On Earth? In our lives? That, that, that we're living?",8,Big Bang Theory,55,10
39725,Sheldon,12," Oh, yes. I, just yesterday, you had a, a big piece of lettuce stuck in your teeth at lunch. Did I say anything? No. I compromised and kept my mouth shut. Like you should've, because everyone was laughing at you.",8,Big Bang Theory,212,40
39726,Leonard,12, That is not a compromise. A compromise is me driving you everywhere because you refuse to learn how.,8,Big Bang Theory,101,18
39727,Sheldon,12," Oh, I learned how. Amy taught me.",8,Big Bang Theory,34,7
39728,Leonard,12, What? Then. then why don't you do it?,8,Big Bang Theory,38,8
39729,Sheldon,12," Uh, well, it's scary. And sometimes I get the pedals mixed up. But, more importantly, driving me to work is one of the things that gives your life purpose. I can't take that away from you, so what do I do? Oh, come on, I'm practically feeding you the answer. I compromise.",8,Big Bang Theory,273,52
39731,Raj,12," Hey, uh, thanks for keeping me company.",8,Big Bang Theory,40,7
39732,Howard,12," I'm happy to. I think getting out of the apartment will do you good. So, where we headed?",8,Big Bang Theory,90,18
39733,Raj,12," If it's okay with you, I'd like to go to temple.",8,Big Bang Theory,49,11
39734,Howard,12," Buddy, trust me, you don't want to convert to Judaism. I mean, I know I make it look cool, but it's not all briskets and dreidels.",8,Big Bang Theory,131,26
39735,Raj,12, I meant a Hindu temple.,8,Big Bang Theory,24,5
39736,Howard,12," Oh. Okay. It's not like Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, right? Some bald guy with horns isn't gonna rip my heart out.",8,Big Bang Theory,124,24
39737,Raj,12," Dude, that movie's an imperialist fantasy that makes the followers of a beautiful and peaceful religion look like a bunch of bloodthirsty barbarians.",8,Big Bang Theory,150,23
39738,Howard,12, You love that movie.,8,Big Bang Theory,21,4
39739,Raj,12," Yeah, it's pretty great.",8,Big Bang Theory,25,4
39740,Howard,12, I'm surprised to see you suddenly get religious.,8,Big Bang Theory,49,8
39741,Raj,12, Why?,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
39742,Howard,12," Well, because I've known you for ten years and you've never gone to temple, you never talked about believing in God, and last Diwali I watched you eat two pounds of sacred cow at a Brazilian steak house.",8,Big Bang Theory,204,38
39743,Raj,12," Religion is a very personal thing. I do go to temple, I just, I don't talk about it.",8,Big Bang Theory,85,18
39744,Howard,12," Yeah, but you're a scientist.",8,Big Bang Theory,30,5
39745,Raj,12, So?,8,Big Bang Theory,4,1
39746,Howard,12," So, as a scientist, you believe the way to understand the universe is through facts and evidence, and now you're counting on some blue chick with a hundred arms to help you?",8,Big Bang Theory,174,32
39747,Raj,12, That is so offensive. Does everything you know about Hinduism come from Indiana Jones?,8,Big Bang Theory,87,14
39748,Howard,12, No. There's also Apu from The Simpsons.,8,Big Bang Theory,40,7
39749,Raj,12," Well, lots of scientists believe in God. Okay? Newton, uh, Faraday, uh, Pascal, all were believers. Even Einstein was famous for attacking quantum theory on the grounds that God does not play dice with the universe.",8,Big Bang Theory,216,36
39750,Howard,12," Well, of course he believed in God. he slept with Marilyn Monroe.",8,Big Bang Theory,66,12
39751,Raj,12, Actually there's no proof of that.,8,Big Bang Theory,35,6
39752,Howard,12," You believe in your religion, I'll believe in mine.",8,Big Bang Theory,52,9
39754,Amy,12, How's it going in there?,8,Big Bang Theory,25,5
39755,Penny,12," Uh, not really a great outfit for work, unless something opens up in the hookers and whores division. Hey, can I ask you something?",8,Big Bang Theory,132,24
39756,Amy,12, Sure.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
39757,Penny,12, Do I really force you to do things you don't want to?,8,Big Bang Theory,54,12
39758,Amy,12," Yeah, but it's okay.",8,Big Bang Theory,21,4
39759,Penny,12, How is it okay?,8,Big Bang Theory,16,4
39760,Amy,12," I promised myself, if I ever got friends, I'd do whatever they said. Really, I'm lucky you found me before a cult did.",8,Big Bang Theory,119,23
39761,Penny,12," Well, you know, that was a long time ago. You're a different woman now. You're smart, you've got great friends, you've got a boyfriend, you're pretty, you have zero fashion sense, but, anyway, tonight we're gonna do whatever you want.",8,Big Bang Theory,235,40
39762,Amy,12, Really?,8,Big Bang Theory,8,1
39763,Penny,12," Absolutely. You name it, we're doing it.",8,Big Bang Theory,41,7
39764,Amy,12, Basket weaving at the craft museum.,8,Big Bang Theory,36,6
39765,Penny,12," Well, you named it.",8,Big Bang Theory,20,4
39767,Sheldon,12," Oh, here's another one. I wish that the apple pancake mix was on the top shelf because it starts with an A, but I don't put it there because I don't want you breaking one of your little legs when you're supposed to be making my breakfast.",8,Big Bang Theory,239,47
39768,Leonard,12, Is it my turn to talk about the compromises I make?,8,Big Bang Theory,52,11
39769,Sheldon,12," I wasn't done, but go ahead. He said, compromising.",8,Big Bang Theory,52,9
39770,Leonard,12," Because of you, I'm not allowed to adjust the temperature in my own home. I'm not allowed to whistle. I don't wear shoes that might squeak.",8,Big Bang Theory,140,26
39771,Sheldon,12," Well, you're a physicist, not a circus clown.",8,Big Bang Theory,46,8
39772,Leonard,12," Sheldon, do you realize I don't live with the woman I love because of you? No other reason. Just you.",8,Big Bang Theory,102,20
39773,Sheldon,12, Is that true?,8,Big Bang Theory,14,3
39774,Leonard,12," Yes, it's true. The last time I brought it up, you had an emotional breakdown and got on a train and ran away.",8,Big Bang Theory,111,23
39775,Sheldon,12," Well, given my history on the subject, t seems a little reckless to bring it up now.",8,Big Bang Theory,85,17
39776,Leonard,12, You have no idea how much you inconvenience the lives of everyone around you. It's exhausting.,8,Big Bang Theory,95,16
39777,Sheldon,12," You know what? You think you're so tolerant, but the truth is you're mean to me a lot. Yeah, you think that I don't notice all those sarcastic comments and those eye rolls, but I do. Hmm? I have excellent peripheral vision. On a good day, I can see my ears.",8,Big Bang Theory,258,51
39778,Leonard,12," Sheldon, I, I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. I've been holding a lot of this in for a while.",8,Big Bang Theory,95,20
39779,Sheldon,12," Well, I'm sorry, too. And if you want to live with Penny, then I think you should.",8,Big Bang Theory,83,17
39780,Leonard,12, Do you mean that?,8,Big Bang Theory,18,4
39781,Sheldon,12," Yes. Yeah, just put on your squeaky shoes and eee-eee-eee your way out of my life.",8,Big Bang Theory,83,16
39782,Leonard,12," Come on, don't get upset.",8,Big Bang Theory,26,5
39783,Sheldon,12, I'm not upset. I'm just imagining a world without my best friend in it.,8,Big Bang Theory,72,14
39784,Leonard,12, Sheldon.,8,Big Bang Theory,9,1
39785,Sheldon,12, It's okay.,8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
39786,Leonard,12, I'm not leaving your world. I'm just talking about living across the hall.,8,Big Bang Theory,75,13
39787,Sheldon,12," I understand. Either way, I want you to know that I'm aware of how difficult I can be. So I just want to say thank you for putting up with me.",8,Big Bang Theory,143,31
39788,Leonard,12, Buddy.,8,Big Bang Theory,7,1
39789,Penny,12, How are you guys getting along? What? Why are there tears?,8,Big Bang Theory,59,11
39790,Leonard,12, Everything's fine. We just started talking about living arrangements.,8,Big Bang Theory,70,9
39791,Amy,12, Are you crazy? You know he's a flight risk.,8,Big Bang Theory,44,9
39792,Sheldon,12, That's exactly what I told him.,8,Big Bang Theory,32,6
39793,Penny,12," Sheldon, we know this is a sensitive subject, and Leonard's not gonna move out until you're ready.",8,Big Bang Theory,99,17
39794,Sheldon,12," Well, what if you did it gradually?",8,Big Bang Theory,36,7
39795,Leonard,12, All right. How about we start with two nights a week I live with Penny?,8,Big Bang Theory,72,15
39796,Sheldon,12, How about one night and I let you whistle?,8,Big Bang Theory,43,9
39797,Leonard,12, Okay.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
39798,Sheldon,12, When I'm not home.,8,Big Bang Theory,19,4
39799,Leonard,12, You got it.,8,Big Bang Theory,12,3
39800,Sheldon,12," There we go, compromising again. We really are the best.",8,Big Bang Theory,57,10
39802,Howard,12," Here we go, my first Hindu temple.",8,Big Bang Theory,35,7
39803,Raj,12," You see behind the fountain, that tower that looks like a pyramid? It's called a Sikhara. It symbolizes the, the connection between the human and the divine.",8,Big Bang Theory,158,27
39804,Howard,12, Huh. I always thought it was mini golf.,8,Big Bang Theory,40,8
39805,Raj,12, All right. Shall we?,8,Big Bang Theory,21,4
39806,Howard,12," Yeah. Just, uh, is there anything I should know before I go in?",8,Big Bang Theory,64,13
39807,Raj,12, Like what?,8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
39808,Howard,12, Like am I dressed okay?,8,Big Bang Theory,24,5
39809,Raj,12," Really? So every other place you've been, you thought this was fine?",8,Big Bang Theory,69,12
39810,Howard,12," I know you're under a lot of pressure, so I'm gonna let that pass.",8,Big Bang Theory,67,14
39811,Raj,12," Sorry. You're right. I'm so stressed. But you know what, whenever I walk into that temple I realize that whatever happens, it's okay. We're all part of an immense pattern, and though we can't understand it, we can be happy to know that it's, it's working its will through us.",8,Big Bang Theory,276,50
39812,Howard,12, That's nice.,8,Big Bang Theory,13,2
39813,Raj,12," Whether you call it God or the universe or the self, we're all interconnected, and that's just a beautiful Son of a bitch, that guy just dinged my car. S, seriously? You were just gonna drive away? Like my life isn't hard enough right now. A space probe might be destroyed, my parents are going through an awful divorce, the guy who cuts my dog's hair just gave her bangs.",8,Big Bang Theory,373,70
39814,Howard,12, Raj.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
39815,Raj,12, You saw her. She looks like Jim Carrey from Dumb and Dumber.,8,Big Bang Theory,61,12
39816,Howard,12," Raj, you just got a text. The probe turned on. It's fine.",8,Big Bang Theory,58,12
39817,Raj,12," Oh, good. Namaste, Grandpa.",8,Big Bang Theory,28,4
39819,Leonard,12," I thought this was gonna be boring, but it's actually kind of fun.",8,Big Bang Theory,67,13
39820,Penny,12, Don't tell Amy that. We'll be here every Sunday.,8,Big Bang Theory,49,9
39821,Amy,12," Sheldon, that really is an excellent basket.",8,Big Bang Theory,45,7
39822,Sheldon,12, It's not a basket. It's a soldier's helmet from 16th century China.,8,Big Bang Theory,68,12
39823,Amy,12, Very nice.,8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
39824,Leonard,12," Yeah, it looks great.",8,Big Bang Theory,22,4
39825,Sheldon,12, I saw that.,8,Big Bang Theory,12,3
39827,Leonard,12," Well, roomie, it's only one night a week, but it's a start.",8,Big Bang Theory,60,12
39828,Penny,12, I know. I'm really proud of Sheldon.,8,Big Bang Theory,37,7
39829,Leonard,12," Yeah, I'm proud of him, too.",8,Big Bang Theory,29,6
39830,Sheldon,12, Can you keep it down? Some of us are trying to sleep out here.,8,Big Bang Theory,63,14
39832,Leonard,13," Okay, we're headed out, see you later.",8,Big Bang Theory,39,7
39833,Sheldon,13," Before you leave, could you test these noise-cancelling headphones?",8,Big Bang Theory,68,9
39834,Leonard,13," Yeah, sure.",8,Big Bang Theory,12,2
39835,Sheldon,13, Okay. Go ahead.,8,Big Bang Theory,16,3
39836,Leonard,13," Hello, can you hear me? Sheldon, I haven't changed the filter in the water pitcher in two years.",8,Big Bang Theory,97,18
39837,Penny,13," Uh, Bernadette's nickname for you is the virgin piÃ±a colada.",8,Big Bang Theory,62,10
39838,Leonard,13, Your George Lucas autograph is really a me autograph.,8,Big Bang Theory,54,9
39839,Penny,13," Yeah, once I was too lazy to walk across the hall, so I used your toothbrush.",8,Big Bang Theory,78,16
39840,Leonard,13," Ooh, and one time when you were asleep, Amy totally took off her and that's why you're the best roommate ever.",8,Big Bang Theory,111,21
39841,Sheldon,13," Aw, now I'm sad I didn't hear it.",8,Big Bang Theory,34,8
39842,Penny,13, So what do you need the headphones for?,8,Big Bang Theory,40,8
39843,Sheldon,13," Well, I've been struggling for months to come up with a theory of dark matter that doesn't make protons decay. I'm hoping to finally tackle it by optimising my work environment. See, I've got, uh, my tea is at the perfect sipping temperature. Uh, I have fleece-lined boxer shorts to keep my tushie toasty. And then, oh, last but not least, this inspirational cat poster improved with the reassuring face of physics renegade Richard Feynman.",8,Big Bang Theory,441,75
39844,Penny,13, Is that why you had to take him to Office Depot last night?,8,Big Bang Theory,60,13
39845,Leonard,13," I don't want to talk about it. There, the place is all yours.",8,Big Bang Theory,62,13
39846,Penny,13," Yeah, have fun.",8,Big Bang Theory,16,3
39847,Sheldon,13," Oh, I will, nothing more fun than a paradigm-shifting evening of science.",8,Big Bang Theory,74,12
39848,Penny,13, And you thought it was soaping me up in the shower.,8,Big Bang Theory,52,11
39849,Leonard,13, Bye.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
39850,Sheldon,13, Okay. Here we go. Proton decay. Proton decay.  Proton decay. Proton decay.  Proton decay. Proton decay.,8,Big Bang Theory,104,16
39851,Leonard,13," Hey, we're home. Any progress?",8,Big Bang Theory,31,5
39852,Sheldon,13," How could there be, with these constant interruptions?",8,Big Bang Theory,55,8
39853,Penny,13," I love him, but if he's broken, let's not get a new one.",8,Big Bang Theory,57,13
39855,Leonard,13, What are you doing? It's time to go.,8,Big Bang Theory,37,8
39856,Sheldon,13, I'm not going to work today. And would you like to know why?,8,Big Bang Theory,61,13
39857,Leonard,13," Ah, you're upset because you spent the whole night working on dark matter and didn't make a breakthrough, and now you're worried you made a huge mistake switching fields, and you're gonna sit around and sulk all day?",8,Big Bang Theory,217,38
39858,Sheldon,13, Like a big old baby.,8,Big Bang Theory,21,5
39859,Leonard,13, Call me if you need anything.,8,Big Bang Theory,30,6
39860,Sheldon,13, I've been cooped up in here too long. Maybe I need some fresh air.,8,Big Bang Theory,67,14
39861,Penny,13, Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! ,8,Big Bang Theory,21,4
39862,Sheldon,13,  Penny?,8,Big Bang Theory,8,1
39863,Penny,13, Ugh!,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
39864,Sheldon,13,  Penny?,8,Big Bang Theory,8,1
39865,Penny,13, Ugh!,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
39866,Sheldon,13,  Penny?,8,Big Bang Theory,8,1
39867,Penny,13," Ugh, what?",8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
39868,Sheldon,13, You sounded in distress. I was worried something unpleasant was happening to you. Like a murder. Or spontaneous coitus with Leonard.,8,Big Bang Theory,133,21
39869,Penny,13," Oh, I'm just doing this awful workout. I hate it.",8,Big Bang Theory,50,10
39870,Sheldon,13," Well, if you hate it, then why are you doing it? Although I could ask the same question about coitus with Leonard.",8,Big Bang Theory,115,22
39871,Penny,13," I don't know, I guess I like that I hate it. It makes me work harder.",8,Big Bang Theory,70,16
39872,Sheldon,13, And to clarify?,8,Big Bang Theory,16,3
39873,Penny,13," The exercise, Sheldon. Shouldn't you be getting ready for work?",8,Big Bang Theory,64,10
39874,Sheldon,13, I'm not going. Would you like to know why?,8,Big Bang Theory,43,9
39875,Penny,13," Uh, you're sad about not getting anything done last night, so you're gonna sit around and pout about it?",8,Big Bang Theory,105,19
39876,Sheldon,13," Boy, I'm not nearly as mysterious as I think I am.",8,Big Bang Theory,51,11
39878,Howard,13, I invented a game. You want to play?,8,Big Bang Theory,37,8
39879,Leonard,13, Sure.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
39880,Howard,13," It's called Emily or Cinnamon. I give you actual quotes I've heard Raj say, and you guess if he was talking to his girlfriend or his dog.",8,Big Bang Theory,138,27
39881,Raj,13," Go ahead, make fun. You can't embarrass me, I've got a beautiful girlfriend and a dog who loves me so much she drinks my bathwater.",8,Big Bang Theory,132,25
39882,Howard,13," Okay, who was he talking to, Emily or Cinnamon? I want you to know, the bed feels so lonely when you're not in it.",8,Big Bang Theory,115,24
39883,Raj,13, I may not be liking this game so much.,8,Big Bang Theory,39,9
39884,Leonard,13, Cinnamon. Give me another one.,8,Big Bang Theory,31,5
39885,Howard,13," Okay, Emily or Cinnamon? Check it out, I got us matching sweaters.",8,Big Bang Theory,67,12
39886,Leonard,13," We all got the Christmas card, Cinnamon.",8,Big Bang Theory,41,7
39887,Raj,13," You know, a man can care deeply about a woman and a pet. It's not strange.",8,Big Bang Theory,75,16
39888,Leonard,13," Ooh, Emily. I heard him say that to Emily. Hey, I thought you were staying home.",8,Big Bang Theory,81,16
39889,Sheldon,13," Yeah, I was, but after talking to Penny, I realised something. I, first, she's trying much harder to stay attractive in this relationship than you are. And second, the reason I may not be progressing in my research is I've created too pleasant of an environment for myself.",8,Big Bang Theory,274,48
39890,Howard,13, What do you mean?,8,Big Bang Theory,18,4
39891,Sheldon,13," According to a classic psychological experiment by Yerkes and Dodson, in order to maximize performance, one must create a state of productive anxiety. So I'd like to ask you all to do something for me. Keep me on my toes. Just throw me off my game. Essentially, go out of your way to make my life miserable.",8,Big Bang Theory,308,57
39892,Howard,13, Hold on. What's in it for us?,8,Big Bang Theory,30,7
39893,Sheldon,13," Well, I suppose",8,Big Bang Theory,16,3
39894,Howard,13," Okay, we'll do it.",8,Big Bang Theory,19,4
39896,Sheldon,13, Done.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
39897,Amy,13," 33 seconds. Okay, that'll be our baseline.",8,Big Bang Theory,43,7
39898,Sheldon,13," You know, I don't want to tell you how to do your job, but when a mouse completes a maze, it gets a food pellet.",8,Big Bang Theory,113,25
39899,Amy,13, It also gets its brain plucked out with tweezers.,8,Big Bang Theory,50,9
39900,Sheldon,13, And his last meal was a food pellet? You're a monster.,8,Big Bang Theory,55,11
39901,Amy,13," All right, next, we're gonna introduce an anxiety-inducing stimulus, measure your stress levels and see how it affects your problem-solving rate.",8,Big Bang Theory,146,21
39902,Sheldon,13," Very well. And good luck, I'm a pretty laid-back guy.",8,Big Bang Theory,54,10
39903,Amy,13, Ready? Begin. Why'd you pop it?,8,Big Bang Theory,32,6
39904,Sheldon,13," I'm sorry, I was aiming for your heart.",8,Big Bang Theory,40,8
39905,Amy,13," Look, I know you don't like it, but that's the point of the experiment. I need to irritate you to find your optimal anxiety zone. And you said no to tickling, polka music or watching me eat a banana.",8,Big Bang Theory,200,39
39906,Sheldon,13, Who eats them horizontally?,8,Big Bang Theory,28,4
39907,Amy,13, My mother said that's how good girls do it.,8,Big Bang Theory,44,9
39908,Sheldon,13, Perhaps this was a waste of time.,8,Big Bang Theory,34,7
39909,Amy,13," Sheldon, you're a remarkable scientist. Just be patient, I'm sure you'll find the breakthrough you've been looking for.",8,Big Bang Theory,120,18
39910,Sheldon,13, Thank you.,8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
39911,Amy,13," And if you only do solid research instead of making a groundbreaking discovery, what does it matter?",8,Big Bang Theory,101,17
39912,Sheldon,13," Only do solid research? I come to you for help, and you insult me? I thought the least that you would do would be",8,Big Bang Theory,114,24
39913,Amy,13," Look, your anxiety levels are right in the zone.",8,Big Bang Theory,49,9
39914,Sheldon,13," Really? Oh, that's fantastic. Now, wait, they're dropping. Why are they dropping?",8,Big Bang Theory,82,12
39915,Amy,13, Because you're happy they're elevated.,8,Big Bang Theory,39,5
39916,Sheldon,13," Oh, that is infuriating. Ooh, look, they went back up again. Terrific. Oh, no, they went back down.",8,Big Bang Theory,100,18
39918,Raj,13," All right, guys, what game do you want to play?",8,Big Bang Theory,48,10
39919,Howard,13, Let's see. How about Emily or Cinnamon?,8,Big Bang Theory,40,7
39920,Raj,13," You know what? I think it's a little weird that you remember me saying all these things. Maybe the truth is, you're jealous of all my relationships.",8,Big Bang Theory,149,27
39921,Howard,13," Oh, maybe I am. Who wouldn't want to be the girl, or possibly dog, to hear the words you're so lucky, you have the shiniest hair.",8,Big Bang Theory,130,26
39922,Leonard,13," That is a tough one. Uh, I know he brushes both of them.",8,Big Bang Theory,57,13
39923,Sheldon,13," Gentlemen, I have figured out the perfect way for you to irritate me. I'd like you to be my intellectual sparring partners. From now on, when I make an assertion, I need you to challenge it.",8,Big Bang Theory,191,36
39924,Leonard,13, So you just want us to disagree with whatever you say?,8,Big Bang Theory,55,11
39925,Sheldon,13, Yes.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
39926,Raj,13, And you think that's going to help?,8,Big Bang Theory,36,7
39927,Sheldon,13, Yes.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
39928,Howard,13," Well, I don't think that's gonna help at all.",8,Big Bang Theory,46,9
39929,Sheldon,13," Oh, no, it will. See, by keeping my mind engaged, I'll become more focused.",8,Big Bang Theory,76,14
39930,Leonard,13," Howard's right, that'll never work.",8,Big Bang Theory,36,5
39931,Sheldon,13," Stop fighting me on the premise. It's scientifically valid. I'm going to advance propositions, I just want you to challenge me.",8,Big Bang Theory,128,21
39932,Raj,13, I don't think that's what you want at all.,8,Big Bang Theory,43,9
39933,Sheldon,13," Why, of course it's what I want. Why would I say it's what I want if it's not what I want?",8,Big Bang Theory,91,21
39934,Leonard,13," Because it is what you want, and it's not what you said.",8,Big Bang Theory,57,12
39935,Sheldon,13," I ask you for one simple thing, and you can't even do it.",8,Big Bang Theory,58,13
39936,Howard,13," Yes, we can.",8,Big Bang Theory,13,3
39937,Sheldon,13," Yeah, well, then do it.",8,Big Bang Theory,24,5
39938,Howard,13, Nah.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
39939,Sheldon,13," You guys are the worst. Thank you, I think that was helpful.",8,Big Bang Theory,61,12
39941,Penny,13," So, whichever rep has the best sales for the quarter gets a trip for two to Hawaii.",8,Big Bang Theory,84,17
39942,Amy,13, That would be so romantic for you and Leonard.,8,Big Bang Theory,47,9
39943,Penny,13," Yeah, clearly you haven't seen him on the beach walking around with his metal detector.",8,Big Bang Theory,88,15
39944,Amy,13," If I were going to Hawaii, I'd spend all my time at the Keck Observatory. Did you know that the telescopes there have better resolution than the Hubble?",8,Big Bang Theory,153,28
39945,Penny,13, Really? Want to go to Hawaii?,8,Big Bang Theory,30,6
39946,Sheldon,13,  Ladies?  Ladies?  Ladies?,8,Big Bang Theory,27,3
39947,Penny,13, Come in.,8,Big Bang Theory,9,2
39948,Sheldon,13, Ladies.,8,Big Bang Theory,8,1
39949,Penny,13, What's up?,8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
39950,Sheldon,13," Well, as you may know, I've been experimenting with elevated anxiety levels, and I thought, what better way to increase my discomfort than to subject myself to an evening of tasteless uncensored crotch talk?",8,Big Bang Theory,208,34
39951,Penny,13, What exactly do you think goes on here?,8,Big Bang Theory,40,8
39952,Sheldon,13," Well, conversations that you wouldn't be comfortable having in front of the opposite sex. You know, who has the best cervix. Which sanitary napkin is all the rage right now. Men's buttocks, and how you want to pat and squeeze them.",8,Big Bang Theory,232,41
39954,Sheldon,13," And how difficult it is to do when she's bloated, cranky and crampy? Continue.",8,Big Bang Theory,79,14
39955,Penny,13," Sheldon, we are just people. We talk about the same things you guys talk about.",8,Big Bang Theory,80,15
39956,Sheldon,13," You talk about if werewolves can swim? See, Leonard says yes, but I say it depends on if the human could swim before he was bitten. What do you think?",8,Big Bang Theory,151,30
39957,Penny,13, Let's just talk about our periods.,8,Big Bang Theory,35,6
39958,Amy,13," No, hold on. All canines instinctively know how to swim. Why wouldn't a werewolf have the same abilities?",8,Big Bang Theory,106,18
39960,Sheldon,13," Thank you. Oh, and technically, it's apples that turn into were-oranges when the moon is full. Hey, this is fun. We should do it sometime when you aren't all PMS'ing. Bye.",8,Big Bang Theory,172,31
39962,Leonard,13, What is going on?,8,Big Bang Theory,18,4
39963,Sheldon,13," Oh. Uh, I need to keep my anxiety at the right level, so I'm using Darth Vader, the Joker, and Godzilla's roar to keep me in that sweet spot. Uh, I tried including Taylor Swift in the mix, but turns out I love her.",8,Big Bang Theory,215,44
39964,Leonard,13," Well, at least listen to it through headphones. I'm trying to sleep. Good night.",8,Big Bang Theory,81,14
39965,Sheldon,13," Boy, Taylor was right, haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.",8,Big Bang Theory,66,11
39967,Amy,13," You've been working so much lately, I'm glad you didn't forget about date night.",8,Big Bang Theory,81,14
39968,Sheldon,13, Of course.,8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
39969,Amy,13, Sheldon.,8,Big Bang Theory,9,1
39970,Sheldon,13, Yeah.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
39971,Amy,13, Maybe you want to put the notebook away and talk to me.,8,Big Bang Theory,56,12
39972,Sheldon,13, I can do both. My brain is working at optimal capacity. I can have a conversation with you and solve the dark matter proton decay problem at the same time.,8,Big Bang Theory,156,30
39973,Amy,13, Fine. How was your day?,8,Big Bang Theory,24,5
39974,Sheldon,13," Oh, you said it.",8,Big Bang Theory,17,4
39975,Amy,13," Sheldon. Sheldon, I'm worried about you. You're not eating, you haven't slept in days, and, to be honest, that cap is starting to smell.",8,Big Bang Theory,137,24
39976,Sheldon,13, I know. It's replaced Godzilla as my principle source of anxiety.,8,Big Bang Theory,66,11
39978,Howard,13," Okay, so it's one vote Emily, one vote Cinnamon. Penny, you're the tiebreaker.",8,Big Bang Theory,79,13
39979,Penny,13, Say the quote again.,8,Big Bang Theory,21,4
39980,Howard,13, It's just so perfect that we're both Libras.,8,Big Bang Theory,45,8
39981,Penny,13," Wow, this is hard. I'm gonna say Cinnamon.",8,Big Bang Theory,43,8
39982,Howard,13, Yes.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
39983,Penny,13, Yes.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
39984,Raj,13, Come on.,8,Big Bang Theory,9,2
39985,Howard,13," That was the last one, I promise. We won't play any more.",8,Big Bang Theory,58,12
39986,Raj,13," Thank you. â€˜Cause if she ever found out, it would hurt her feelings.",8,Big Bang Theory,71,13
39988,Raj,13," Yes, Emily. Whatever. Where's Sheldon?",8,Big Bang Theory,39,5
39989,Penny,13, Date night.,8,Big Bang Theory,12,2
39990,Leonard,13," That can't be much fun for Amy. You know, at work today, he tried his first Red Bull.",8,Big Bang Theory,86,18
39992,Leonard,13, He chased a squirrel around the quad for a while and then threw up in my car.,8,Big Bang Theory,78,17
39994,Howard,13," I don't know, he's not really hurting anybody.",8,Big Bang Theory,47,8
39995,Leonard,13, You didn't have to scoop vomit out of your glove compartment.,8,Big Bang Theory,62,11
39996,Sheldon,13, He is getting a lot of work done. He had a pretty interesting take on proton decay.,8,Big Bang Theory,84,17
39997,Raj,13," Wow, if he cracks that it's a game changer, guys. It'll completely redefine our understanding of the physical universe.",8,Big Bang Theory,120,19
39998,Howard,13," Hmm, it would. Okay, back to Emily or Cinnamon? How can such a little girl eat such a big steak?",8,Big Bang Theory,97,20
40000,Amy,13," Sheldon, I want you to take that cap off.",8,Big Bang Theory,42,9
40001,Sheldon,13," That nagging tone is helping my anxiety, yeah. But if you could maybe just go ten percent less shrill, that'd really put the zip-a-dee in my doo-dah.",8,Big Bang Theory,150,27
40002,Amy,13," I'm sorry, but you know we agreed not to bring work to date night.",8,Big Bang Theory,67,14
40003,Sheldon,13," There you go, perfect.",8,Big Bang Theory,23,4
40004,Amy,13," Sheldon, stop it, I'm not kidding. Take the cap off, and put the notebook away.",8,Big Bang Theory,80,15
40005,Sheldon,13," But after months of struggling, I'm finally making progress.",8,Big Bang Theory,61,9
40006,Amy,13, You don't need to drive yourself crazy in order to be productive.,8,Big Bang Theory,66,12
40007,Sheldon,13," Or do I, hmm? Sir Isaac Newton wrote his Principia while convinced he was an armadillo.",8,Big Bang Theory,88,16
40008,Amy,13, That's not true.,8,Big Bang Theory,17,3
40009,Sheldon,13," Yeah, well, maybe it is, maybe it isn't. I have been hallucinating lately.",8,Big Bang Theory,75,13
40010,Amy,13," Sheldon, this has to stop. You need to get some sleep and take care of yourself.",8,Big Bang Theory,81,16
40011,Sheldon,13," Amy, I have gotten more done in the last few days than I have since I made the switch to dark matter. What if I stop doing this, and it all goes away?",8,Big Bang Theory,151,33
40012,Amy,13," Your thoughts and ideas come from you, not from your anxiety.",8,Big Bang Theory,62,11
40013,Sheldon,13," Hmm, perhaps. But I'm not taking the cap off.",8,Big Bang Theory,46,9
40014,Amy,13," It's one thing to make yourself miserable, but you're making everyone around you miserable, too. Now, I'm telling you for the last time, take the cap off.",8,Big Bang Theory,155,27
40015,Sheldon,13," Oh, really? What if I don't? And before you answer that, can I have my dessert?",8,Big Bang Theory,80,16
40017,Sheldon,13," And then she threw me out. Me, her very own boyfriend. When all I've done is try to help humanity reach of the world we live in.",8,Big Bang Theory,129,27
40019,Sheldon,13," I knew you'd understand, Armadillo Isaac Newton.",8,Big Bang Theory,49,7
40021,Penny,13, Okay.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
40022,Leonard,13, Here we are.,8,Big Bang Theory,13,3
40023,Sheldon,13, Hey. What are you trying to pull? The president of science isn't in here.,8,Big Bang Theory,74,14
40024,Leonard,13," You lie down, he'll be here in a minute.",8,Big Bang Theory,41,9
40025,Sheldon,13," Okay. Hey, I thought you were trying to trick me.",8,Big Bang Theory,50,10
40026,Penny,13," Now, you just get comfortable.",8,Big Bang Theory,31,5
40027,Sheldon,13," No, no, comfort is the enemy. You know what's comfortable? Slippers and blankets and panda bears. Imagine a panda bear with Richard Feynman's face on it. Warm up the car, Leonard, it's poster time.",8,Big Bang Theory,198,34
40028,Leonard,13, Maybe in the morning.,8,Big Bang Theory,22,4
40029,Penny,13," Yeah, you get some sleep.",8,Big Bang Theory,26,5
40030,Sheldon,13," No, I don't want to go to sleep, you can't make me.",8,Big Bang Theory,52,12
40031,Penny,13," You're right, we can't.",8,Big Bang Theory,24,4
40032,Sheldon,13," Yeah, darn straight, you can't. Try to tell a grown man to go to sleep.",8,Big Bang Theory,72,15
40033,Penny,13," Soft kitty, warm kitty.",8,Big Bang Theory,24,4
40034,Leonard,13, Little ball of fur.,8,Big Bang Theory,20,4
40035,Sheldon,13, That's not gonna work.,8,Big Bang Theory,23,4
40036,Penny,13," Happy kitty, sleepy kitty.",8,Big Bang Theory,27,4
40038,Leonard,13," You know, he can be a lot of trouble, but when I see him lying here asleep like this, I just think how easy it would be to hold a pillow over his face.",8,Big Bang Theory,152,34
40039,Penny,13, Mmmm.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
40041,Howard,13, You look like you got some rest.,8,Big Bang Theory,33,7
40042,Sheldon,13," Oh, I'm feeling much better. And I've also been continuing to make progress without artificially raising my anxiety levels.",8,Big Bang Theory,124,19
40043,Leonard,13," I turned on the heat in my car and some vomit came out, so my levels, right up there.",8,Big Bang Theory,86,19
40044,Raj,13," Hey, guys. Mind if Emily joins us for lunch?",8,Big Bang Theory,45,9
40045,Leonard,13," Yeah, sure.",8,Big Bang Theory,12,2
40046,Howard,13," Yeah, no problem.",8,Big Bang Theory,18,3
40047,Sheldon,13, Of course not.,8,Big Bang Theory,15,3
40049,Howard,13," Well, um, we were just kidding around.",8,Big Bang Theory,39,7
40052,Penny,14," So, tell me about your day, how's it going with the particle detector?",8,Big Bang Theory,71,13
40053,Leonard,14," Wow, you remember that?",8,Big Bang Theory,24,4
40054,Penny,14," Yeah, I listen to what you say. You're building a particle detector using superfluid helium.",8,Big Bang Theory,93,15
40055,Leonard,14," You know, when you talk like that, I want to take you right here on this table.",8,Big Bang Theory,80,17
40056,Penny,14," And you know from past experience this table cannot support both our weight. So, how's the detector going?",8,Big Bang Theory,107,18
40057,Leonard,14," Well, it's tricky working with superfluids. Whatever container you put them in, they kind of creep up the sides and crawl out all on their own.",8,Big Bang Theory,144,26
40058,Penny,14, Kind of like Sheldon's ant farm.,8,Big Bang Theory,33,6
40059,Leonard,14," Exactly, except you don't have a lunatic running around, yelling, I fed you sugar water, why are you biting me? Come on, this is boring, you really want to talk about this?",8,Big Bang Theory,173,32
40060,Penny,14," No, I do. I didn't write superfluid helium on this napkin for nothing.",8,Big Bang Theory,71,13
40061,Leonard,14," Okay, well, this is cool. Uh, there's a thing called superfluid vacuum theory, where empty space is imagined as a superfluid with all of its qualities, viscosity, density, surface tension",8,Big Bang Theory,188,30
40062,Penny,14," Hey, if you're pausing for dramatic effect, I'd keep it moving.",8,Big Bang Theory,64,11
40063,Leonard,14," No, no. People don't talk about surface tension. If you imagine our three-space as the surface of an N-dimensional superfluid bubble This is exciting. This is really exciting. I have to go find Sheldon.",8,Big Bang Theory,203,34
40064,Penny,14," Okay, well, if you find him, use the kitchen island, that coffee table will not support both of you.",8,Big Bang Theory,101,19
40066,Leonard,14, Which means a spherical multidimensional superfluid shows the same negative-energy density as space-time. So what do you think? What do you think? So what do you think?,8,Big Bang Theory,169,27
40067,Sheldon,14, Hmm.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
40068,Leonard,14, What? Is it wrong? Have you seen it somewhere else?,8,Big Bang Theory,52,10
40069,Sheldon,14, Hmm.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
40070,Leonard,14," I know this isn't my area, and I could never do the math like you can, but could this be something?",8,Big Bang Theory,100,21
40071,Sheldon,14," Well, you could have set Newton's gravitational constant to one. And, ugh, the whole thing reeks of blueberry. You know I can't stand these scented markers.",8,Big Bang Theory,157,26
40072,Leonard,14," No one told you to taste them. Come on, is, is this good or not?",8,Big Bang Theory,65,15
40073,Sheldon,14, It's good.,8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
40074,Leonard,14, Really?,8,Big Bang Theory,8,1
40075,Sheldon,14, I like it. I think you're on to something.,8,Big Bang Theory,43,9
40076,Leonard,14, You do? You're not messing with me?,8,Big Bang Theory,36,7
40077,Sheldon,14," Not at all. In fact, I have got something for just such an occasion. I was starting to think I might never get a chance to give it to you. Good job.",8,Big Bang Theory,149,32
40078,Leonard,14, You're giving me a sticker?,8,Big Bang Theory,28,5
40079,Sheldon,14, Not just a sticker. That is a sticker of a kitty saying me-wow.,8,Big Bang Theory,64,13
40080,Leonard,14, I'm not a preschooler.,8,Big Bang Theory,23,4
40081,Sheldon,14," Fine, I'll take it back.",8,Big Bang Theory,25,5
40082,Leonard,14, I earned this. Back off.,8,Big Bang Theory,25,5
40084,Leonard,14, You're still awake?,8,Big Bang Theory,20,3
40085,Sheldon,14," For a man whose last observation was our universe may be the surface of a multidimensional supercooled liquid, you're still awake seems like quite the sophomore slump.",8,Big Bang Theory,168,27
40086,Leonard,14, You worked out all the math.,8,Big Bang Theory,29,6
40087,Sheldon,14," Oh, I did more than work out all the math. I wrote a paper.",8,Big Bang Theory,60,14
40088,Leonard,14, You wrote a paper on my idea?,8,Big Bang Theory,30,7
40089,Sheldon,14, I wrote a paper on our idea.,8,Big Bang Theory,29,7
40090,Leonard,14, When did my idea become our idea?,8,Big Bang Theory,34,7
40091,Sheldon,14, When I mixed it with Sheldony goodness and cooked it in the Easy-Bake oven of my mind.,8,Big Bang Theory,87,17
40092,Leonard,14, This is good. Our idea is really good.,8,Big Bang Theory,39,8
40093,Sheldon,14," Well, the lightbulb in this oven is ridiculously bright.",8,Big Bang Theory,57,9
40094,Leonard,14," You know, if no one's thought of this, yet, this could be a big deal.",8,Big Bang Theory,70,15
40095,Sheldon,14," Only way we'll know for sure is if we post it online to the pre-print server. I have it ready to go, but I wasn't gonna do it without you.",8,Big Bang Theory,139,30
40096,Leonard,14," Wow, it's all happening so fast. Should we just sleep on it?",8,Big Bang Theory,61,12
40097,Sheldon,14," We could, but we always run the risk of someone else beating us to the punch.",8,Big Bang Theory,78,16
40098,Leonard,14, You're sure it's good?,8,Big Bang Theory,23,4
40099,Sheldon,14, My name is right on there with yours. That is a surefire mark of quality. That might as well say directed by Joss Whedon.,8,Big Bang Theory,122,24
40100,Leonard,14," Okay, partner, let's do it.",8,Big Bang Theory,28,5
40101,Sheldon,14, Come on. Click the mouse with me.,8,Big Bang Theory,34,7
40102,Leonard,14," One, two three.",8,Big Bang Theory,16,3
40104,Leonard,14," Well, we did it.",8,Big Bang Theory,17,4
40105,Sheldon,14," Yes, we did, my friend.",8,Big Bang Theory,24,5
40106,Leonard,14, Is your tongue blue?,8,Big Bang Theory,21,4
40107,Sheldon,14, I don't want to talk about it.,8,Big Bang Theory,31,7
40110,Amy,14, Whatever happened to that ape movie you were in?,8,Big Bang Theory,49,9
40111,Penny,14," Oh, God. Probably nothing. I think I saw the director twirling a sign outside the Verizon store.",8,Big Bang Theory,97,17
40113,Penny,14," What, no, why?",8,Big Bang Theory,15,3
40115,Penny,14, It would be humiliating.,8,Big Bang Theory,25,4
40117,Amy,14, They have it.,8,Big Bang Theory,14,3
40119,Amy,14, Please?,8,Big Bang Theory,8,1
40120,Penny,14," Fine, but I'm telling you, it's terrible.",8,Big Bang Theory,42,7
40121,Amy,14, Have you even seen it?,8,Big Bang Theory,23,5
40122,Penny,14, No.,8,Big Bang Theory,4,1
40127,Leonard,14," Sheldon, this is superfluid helium. Put this in your mouth, your tongue will freeze and break off.",8,Big Bang Theory,99,17
40128,Sheldon,14, Does it smell like blueberries?,8,Big Bang Theory,32,5
40129,Leonard,14, No.,8,Big Bang Theory,4,1
40130,Sheldon,14, Then we're probably okay.,8,Big Bang Theory,26,4
40131,Howard,14," Hey, your paper got mentioned on the Quantum Diaries physics blog.",8,Big Bang Theory,67,11
40132,Leonard,14, Really? What'd they say?,8,Big Bang Theory,25,4
40133,Howard,14," Uh, it's basically a summary of the theory, but there's a bunch of positive comments on the message board.",8,Big Bang Theory,107,19
40134,Leonard,14," Let me see, let me see. One calls it insightful and innovative. We're insightful and innovative.",8,Big Bang Theory,97,16
40135,Sheldon,14," Oh, nice to meet you, Mr. Insightful.",8,Big Bang Theory,38,7
40136,Leonard,14," Oh, the pleasure is mine, Mr. Innovative. Uh, another one says the concept shows some real out-of-the-box thinking. Do you hear that, Mr. Out-Of-The?",8,Big Bang Theory,150,24
40137,Sheldon,14," I do, indeed, Mr. Box-Thinking.",8,Big Bang Theory,32,5
40138,Howard,14," How are you today, Mr. Can-You-Believe-These-Jack-Asses?",8,Big Bang Theory,57,6
40139,Raj,14," Just dandy, Mr I-Wish-I-Was-Better-At-Improv.",8,Big Bang Theory,46,4
40140,Sheldon,14, Read another one.,8,Big Bang Theory,18,3
40141,Leonard,14," Okay, okay. Uh, the analogy between space-time and a supercooled fluid is either meaningless or false. I wish this blog would devote itself to real science instead of wasting our time with crackpot wannabe theoreticians in a rush to publish.",8,Big Bang Theory,242,40
40142,Sheldon,14, Who wrote that?,8,Big Bang Theory,16,3
40143,Leonard,14," It's anonymous, and user name General Relativity.",8,Big Bang Theory,50,7
40144,Sheldon,14," Well, I'm responding to it.",8,Big Bang Theory,28,5
40145,Leonard,14," Uh, don't lower yourself to their level.",8,Big Bang Theory,41,7
40146,Sheldon,14," Look, I am simply going to defend our work, scientist to scientist. And failing that, suggest that his mother enjoys a string of both human and non-human lovers.",8,Big Bang Theory,162,28
40147,Leonard,14," Sheldon, my name's on that paper, too. There's no upside to doing this.",8,Big Bang Theory,72,13
40148,Sheldon,14, He just left another comment.,8,Big Bang Theory,30,5
40149,Raj,14, What does it say?,8,Big Bang Theory,18,4
40150,Leonard,14," Upon review, I've changed my mind about the Cooper-Hofstadter hypothesis that space-time is like a superfluid. In fact, it's inspired me to come up with my own theory. Maybe space-time is like two clowns with their heads in a bucket, much like Cooper and Hofstadter.",8,Big Bang Theory,267,45
40151,Sheldon,14, Can I respond now?,8,Big Bang Theory,19,4
40152,Leonard,14, Do it.,8,Big Bang Theory,7,2
40153,Sheldon,14," You mess with the bull, you get the horns. I'm about to show this guy just how horny I can be.",8,Big Bang Theory,95,21
40154,Leonard,14, Somebody else do it.,8,Big Bang Theory,21,4
40156,Penny,14," Doctor, please help me. I think I might be turning into a killer gorilla.",8,Big Bang Theory,74,14
40158,Penny,14," Because regular gorillas are vegetarians, and I just bit the fingers off your receptionist.",8,Big Bang Theory,92,14
40159,Penny,14," Okay, we've seen plenty.",8,Big Bang Theory,25,4
40161,Amy,14, Careful. She'll bite your fingers off.,8,Big Bang Theory,39,6
40162,Penny,14," Okay, well, I've been poking around the internet, and I think I found something we'll enjoy watching even more.",8,Big Bang Theory,112,19
40163,Amy,14, What is it?,8,Big Bang Theory,12,3
40164,Penny,14," Oh, just a video of Bernadette in a beauty pageant.",8,Big Bang Theory,52,10
40165,Amy,14, What?,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
40167,Amy,14, I haven't learned my lesson. Play it. Play it.,8,Big Bang Theory,47,9
40169,Penny,14, You look like a talking cupcake.,8,Big Bang Theory,33,6
40171,Amy,14, Play it again. Play it again.,8,Big Bang Theory,30,6
40173,Raj,14, Did he respond yet?,8,Big Bang Theory,20,4
40174,Sheldon,14," Hmm. No, not yet.",8,Big Bang Theory,18,4
40175,Leonard,14," Well, maybe we shouldn't have sunk to his level.",8,Big Bang Theory,49,9
40176,Howard,14, It wasn't that bad.,8,Big Bang Theory,20,4
40177,Leonard,14, Read it back one more time.,8,Big Bang Theory,28,6
40178,Sheldon,14," My good sir, we are neither crackpots nor wannabes. In fact, we are experts in our fields. And while you hide behind your anonymity, we stand behind our paper. And later tonight, your mother.",8,Big Bang Theory,192,34
40179,Leonard,14, And you don't think that's too rough?,8,Big Bang Theory,38,7
40180,Sheldon,14, We're just standing behind her. It's not like we're gonna say boo and scare her.,8,Big Bang Theory,81,15
40182,Penny,14, How could you not tell us you were in beauty pageants?,8,Big Bang Theory,55,11
40184,Penny,14, It is; it truly is.,8,Big Bang Theory,20,5
40186,Penny,14, No.,8,Big Bang Theory,4,1
40187,Amy,14, Why? What did I do?,8,Big Bang Theory,20,5
40189,Penny,14, Okay. We are reading that right now.,8,Big Bang Theory,37,7
40190,Amy,14," No, please don't.",8,Big Bang Theory,18,3
40192,Amy,14, But it's personal.,8,Big Bang Theory,19,3
40193,Penny,14, Why? Is it about you and Sheldon?,8,Big Bang Theory,34,7
40194,Amy,14, No.,8,Big Bang Theory,4,1
40195,Penny,14," Oh, my God, it's about her and Sheldon.",8,Big Bang Theory,40,8
40196,Amy,14," It's not about me and Sheldon. It's about a young woman in the 1800s named Amelia, and the time-traveling physicist named Cooper she falls in love with.",8,Big Bang Theory,153,27
40197,Penny,14, Please show us?,8,Big Bang Theory,16,3
40199,Amy,14, No.,8,Big Bang Theory,4,1
40200,Penny,14, You know I'm gonna read it either way.,8,Big Bang Theory,39,8
40201,Amy,14, Good luck finding it.,8,Big Bang Theory,22,4
40202,Penny,14," Amelia and the time-trav found it. It was just past dawn on the prairie, and like every morning, Amelia prepared to do her chores. Except something about this morning felt different.",8,Big Bang Theory,183,31
40204,Penny,14," Maybe it was the first whisper of winter in the air, or maybe it was the unconscious handsome man with porcelain skin and curious clothing she was about to discover lying in the field. A man who would open her mind to new possibilities and her body to new feelings.",8,Big Bang Theory,266,50
40205,Amy,14," You know, there was a time when I was alone and had no friends. I'm starting to miss that.",8,Big Bang Theory,91,19
40207,Sheldon,14, He still hasn't responded. What's taking him so long?,8,Big Bang Theory,54,9
40208,Leonard,14, Do you really want him to write back?,8,Big Bang Theory,38,8
40209,Sheldon,14," Yeah, I do. Then no matter how he responds, I am going to destroy him with a picture of a bored cat saying oh, really?",8,Big Bang Theory,119,25
40210,Leonard,14, Me-wow.,8,Big Bang Theory,8,1
40211,Howard,14, What are you doing?,8,Big Bang Theory,20,4
40212,Raj,14," I've, uh, created some other user accounts so I can post positive comments about their paper.",8,Big Bang Theory,94,16
40213,Howard,14, This wee li'l bairn of a theory nearly blew my kilt off.,8,Big Bang Theory,57,12
40214,Raj,14, No. You have to read it how Dr. Angus McDougal of the University of Edinburgh would. This wee li'l bairn of a theory nearly blew me kilt off.,8,Big Bang Theory,142,28
40215,Sheldon,14," He wrote back. Cooper and Hofstadter resorting to juvenile attempts at humour is proof they have nothing to back up their ridiculous paper. It should come as no surprise given they work at Cal Tech, essentially a technical school, where even the physicists are basically engineers. Engineers? Do you know how insulting that is?",8,Big Bang Theory,328,54
40216,Howard,14, Yes.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
40217,Raj,14," Guys, this person's just going out of their way to get a rise out of you.",8,Big Bang Theory,74,16
40218,Sheldon,14," Yeah, but it's still so aggravating.",8,Big Bang Theory,37,6
40219,Raj,14," Yeah, well, all the other comments said really nice things. Focus on those.",8,Big Bang Theory,76,13
40220,Howard,14," Yeah. Dr. Dmitri Plancovik of Moscow University said dis paper great, I love it more than wodka.",8,Big Bang Theory,97,17
40221,Raj,14, See? Better with the accent.,8,Big Bang Theory,29,5
40222,Sheldon,14, And send.,8,Big Bang Theory,10,2
40223,Leonard,14, What did you write?,8,Big Bang Theory,20,4
40224,Sheldon,14, I'm done hiding from bullies. I'm taking this into the real world.,8,Big Bang Theory,67,12
40225,Leonard,14, What does that mean?,8,Big Bang Theory,21,4
40226,Sheldon,14," I told him we'll meet him face-to-face anytime, anywhere.",8,Big Bang Theory,58,9
40227,Leonard,14, Are you crazy? You don't know who this person is. Delete that.,8,Big Bang Theory,63,12
40228,Raj,14," Come on, Sheldon!",8,Big Bang Theory,18,3
40229,Sheldon,14," Oh, okay, okay, calm down.  It's him. He's trying to video chat. Perhaps I shouldn't have taken this into the real world.",8,Big Bang Theory,122,22
40230,Leonard,14," Oh, really?",8,Big Bang Theory,12,2
40232,Penny,14," â€œTime travel? I don't understand,â€ù said Amelia. Cooper stared at her. â€˜Which word don't you understand, time or travel?â€ù",8,Big Bang Theory,129,19
40234,Amy,14," He's like that in the beginning, so she can change him. It's called good writing. And wishful thinking.",8,Big Bang Theory,104,18
40235,Penny,14," It stung Amelia when he spoke to her this way. In her little one-room schoolhouse, she was always the smartest student, regularly besting the boys in her class, but this was no boy in front of her, this was a man.",8,Big Bang Theory,214,41
40237,Penny,14," Cooper told Amelia about all the strange and incredible things the future would hold, like computers and living past 30. He asked her if she had any questions. All she longed to ask was if his heart was beating as fast as hers, but she was too afraid to hear the answer.",8,Big Bang Theory,271,52
40239,Penny,14," So instead she asked if, in the future, Montana ever became a state.",8,Big Bang Theory,69,13
40240,Amy,14, In the 1800s that was considered flirting.,8,Big Bang Theory,43,7
40242,Raj,14, I'm so sick of people being mean on the Internet.,8,Big Bang Theory,50,10
40243,Howard,14," Well, I think the anonymity makes everyone feel like they can say things they'd never say to your face.",8,Big Bang Theory,104,19
40244,Sheldon,14, Interesting. I can't think of a single thing I wouldn't say to someone's face.,8,Big Bang Theory,79,14
40245,Leonard,14, Never noticed that about you.,8,Big Bang Theory,30,5
40246,Raj,14," You know what? At least you guys did something. You know, you, you had a theory, you wrote a paper, you made an actual contribution. All guys like this do is just stand on other people's work.",8,Big Bang Theory,193,37
40247,Sheldon,14, He's right. I say we call this person back. We've got no reason to hide.,8,Big Bang Theory,73,15
40248,Leonard,14," All right, do it. Call him. Let's find out what this loser's ever accomplished.",8,Big Bang Theory,80,14
40249,Sheldon,14," Click it with me. One, two, three, click.",8,Big Bang Theory,42,8
40251,Sheldon,14, Professor Hawking?,8,Big Bang Theory,19,2
40253,Leonard,14, You really didn't like our paper?,8,Big Bang Theory,34,6
40255,Sheldon,14, Then why are you attacking us?,8,Big Bang Theory,31,6
40257,Leonard,14, Stephen Hawking liked our paper. Said the premise is intriguing.,8,Big Bang Theory,65,10
40258,Sheldon,14," Good to see you again, Mr. Stephen-Hawking Liked-Our-Paper.",8,Big Bang Theory,60,8
40259,Leonard,14," And you as well, Mr. Our-Premise-Is-Intriguing.",8,Big Bang Theory,48,6
40260,Howard,14," How do you do, Mr. I'll-Admit-That's-Pretty-Cool?",8,Big Bang Theory,50,6
40261,Raj,14," Yeah, you keep setting me up for failure.",8,Big Bang Theory,42,8
40263,Penny,14," With a heavy heart, Amelia stood before the newly repaired time machine. She regretted giving Cooper the part he needed.",8,Big Bang Theory,121,20
40265,Amy,14," Okay, that's enough.",8,Big Bang Theory,21,3
40266,Penny,14," What? No, I really want to know what happens, and Bernadette really, really, really wants to know what happens.",8,Big Bang Theory,112,19
40267,Amy,14, You're just making fun of me.,8,Big Bang Theory,30,6
40269,Penny,14," No, it is. Does he stay? Do they kiss? Does she find out about Montana?",8,Big Bang Theory,72,15
40271,Amy,14," Fine. As Cooper prepared to depart, tears filled Amelia's eyes. He took her hand in his and said, â€œI can't stay, but I will never forget you.â€ù He brushed his fingers against her cheek, then quickly stepped into the machine. â€œPlease don't go,â€ù she whispered. But it was too late. The engine hummed to life.",8,Big Bang Theory,314,55
40273,Amy,14," She turned away, wiping her eyes. She couldn't bear to watch her one chance at true love disappear forever. Then she felt a strong hand on her shoulder spin her around. It was Cooper.",8,Big Bang Theory,184,34
40274,Penny,14, Yes.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
40275,Amy,14," â€œWhat about the future?â€ù asked Amelia. He looked deeply into her eyes and whispered, â€œThere is no future without you.â€ù He pulled her in close. She began to tremble all over. She felt his warm breath",8,Big Bang Theory,207,36
40276,Leonard,14, You will not believe what Stephen Hawking just said.,8,Big Bang Theory,53,9
40277,Penny,14, Get out!,8,Big Bang Theory,9,2
40287,Leonard,14, You're right. This is even weirder than I thought.,8,Big Bang Theory,51,9
40288,Penny,14, You want me to stop reading?,8,Big Bang Theory,29,6
40289,Leonard,14," Are you kidding? No, no.",8,Big Bang Theory,25,5
40290,Penny,14, As he stood for Amelia to dry him,8,Big Bang Theory,34,8
40292,Leonard,14," Yeah, okay, I'm good.",8,Big Bang Theory,22,4
40294,Sheldon,15," I've invented a science joke, would you like to hear it?",8,Big Bang Theory,57,11
40295,Amy,15, Sure.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
40296,Sheldon,15, How many Edisons does it take to screw in a light bulb?,8,Big Bang Theory,56,12
40297,Amy,15, How many?,8,Big Bang Theory,10,2
40298,Sheldon,15, Who cares? He stole the idea and doesn't deserve his own joke.,8,Big Bang Theory,63,12
40299,Amy,15, Is that really true?,8,Big Bang Theory,21,4
40300,Sheldon,15," Of course, that's how you know it's a good joke. It not only entertains, it informs.",8,Big Bang Theory,85,16
40302,Sheldon,15," Uh, Barry, uh, how many Edisons does it take to screw in a light bulb?",8,Big Bang Theory,71,15
40304,Sheldon,15," What do you want, Barry?",8,Big Bang Theory,25,5
40306,Amy,15, What's this for?,8,Big Bang Theory,17,3
40308,Amy,15," Well, that's fascinating. I can't wait to read it.",8,Big Bang Theory,51,9
40309,Sheldon,15," Oh, no, me as well. Uh, please e-mail it to Sheldon at bazinga dot biz. Why dot biz? Because I just gave you the business. And also bazinga dot com was taken.",8,Big Bang Theory,159,32
40311,Sheldon,15, Since when do you help out Barry Kripke?,8,Big Bang Theory,41,8
40312,Amy,15," Well, I'd been thinking about a cellular automata approach to neuronal connectivity, and I thought it might have some interesting applications to string theory, it's not a big deal.",8,Big Bang Theory,182,29
40313,Sheldon,15," Oh, really? When I was doing string theory and hit a dead end, why didn't you try to help me?",8,Big Bang Theory,94,20
40314,Amy,15," I did. You said the only math biologists know is if you have three frogs and one hops away, that leaves two frogs.",8,Big Bang Theory,115,23
40315,Sheldon,15," That's pretty funny, that does sound like me. But that doesn't mean that you should be standing on street corners handing out your math to whatever guy comes along.",8,Big Bang Theory,165,29
40316,Amy,15," Sheldon, we're all scientists. I helped out a fellow colleague. You're being petty.",8,Big Bang Theory,84,13
40317,Sheldon,15," I'm being petty? You know Barry and I have a professional rivalry. You heard him, he told me to suck eggs. If we were friends, he would have suggested I suck something more pleasant. Why are you laughing? Did you learn something?",8,Big Bang Theory,230,42
40319,Howard,15," Okay, Ma. Say hi to Aunt Gladys. Yeah, I love you, too. Bye.",8,Big Bang Theory,61,13
40321,Howard,15," Mmm, she loves it. She finally found a place where everyone talks about how sweaty they are. Anyway, she wants us to go to the house and check in on Stuart because he might be lonely.",8,Big Bang Theory,184,36
40323,Howard,15," Well, I'm her son, how come she doesn't send someone to check on me if I'm lonely?",8,Big Bang Theory,83,17
40325,Howard,15," Yeah, well, sometimes you work late.",8,Big Bang Theory,37,6
40327,Howard,15, That would be great. I'd love for things between me and Mom to get back to normal.,8,Big Bang Theory,83,17
40330,Penny,15, Hey.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
40331,Sheldon,15, Hello.,8,Big Bang Theory,7,1
40332,Penny,15, You okay?,8,Big Bang Theory,10,2
40333,Sheldon,15," If I was okay, I would've said hello, and not the much more ominous hello.",8,Big Bang Theory,75,15
40334,Penny,15, What's going on?,8,Big Bang Theory,17,3
40335,Sheldon,15, I'm mad at Amy.,8,Big Bang Theory,16,4
40336,Penny,15," Did she leave pit stains in your favourite crop top, too?",8,Big Bang Theory,58,11
40337,Sheldon,15, No. She helped Barry Kripke make an advancement in string theory.,8,Big Bang Theory,66,11
40338,Penny,15," Oh, that sounds like a good thing.",8,Big Bang Theory,35,7
40339,Sheldon,15," Well, it would be, except that I left string theory because I decided it was a dead end. Yeah, and then she went behind my back to help someone else prove me wrong. My rival, no less. I'm sorry you had to see that.",8,Big Bang Theory,215,44
40340,Penny,15, I'm sorry I didn't have a camera.,8,Big Bang Theory,34,7
40341,Sheldon,15, Why would she do this to me?,8,Big Bang Theory,29,7
40342,Penny,15," Well, I'm sure she didn't upset you on purpose. Besides, aren't you the one who says there's nothing more important than the advancement of science?",8,Big Bang Theory,149,25
40343,Sheldon,15," No, I said there's nothing more important than me advancing science.",8,Big Bang Theory,69,11
40344,Penny,15," All right, well, if I'm understanding this right, and all she did was help out another scientist, I'm thinking you might have to let this one go.",8,Big Bang Theory,146,27
40345,Sheldon,15," Ugh, let it go. I have heard that my whole life. Every time something upsets me somebody says, let it go, you know, like it's my fault, and it's not okay to feel the way I feel.",8,Big Bang Theory,178,37
40346,Penny,15," I don't know what to tell you. I mean, why don't you talk to her?",8,Big Bang Theory,66,15
40347,Sheldon,15," Is that all you have? Shopworn tidbits like talk to her and let it go? Gee, Penny, life's giving me lemons. What should I do?",8,Big Bang Theory,126,25
40348,Penny,15," Well, you could shove them somewhere.",8,Big Bang Theory,38,6
40349,Sheldon,15," Okay, now you're getting creative.",8,Big Bang Theory,35,5
40352,Leonard,15, No problem.,8,Big Bang Theory,12,2
40353,Raj,15, Our pleasure.,8,Big Bang Theory,14,2
40354,Leonard,15, The place really looks great.,8,Big Bang Theory,30,5
40355,Raj,15," Yeah, you should have burned it down years ago.",8,Big Bang Theory,48,9
40357,Leonard,15," We know, we know, because burning something down for the insurance money is a crime.",8,Big Bang Theory,85,15
40360,Howard,15, You really did a nice job.,8,Big Bang Theory,27,6
40362,Howard,15," I appreciate that, and I'm glad you were able to is that my mother's furniture?",8,Big Bang Theory,80,15
40364,Howard,15, Not as great as it looks in the den where it belongs.,8,Big Bang Theory,54,12
40366,Howard,15, Why don't you just clean out the whole room? Take the string art clown I made her in third grade and the ribbon I got in swim class for putting my face in the water.,8,Big Bang Theory,166,35
40368,Howard,15," Well, I'm her son, and I say it's not okay.",8,Big Bang Theory,44,10
40370,Howard,15," Well, maybe I should've gone to a fancy art school like you. Then I could run a failed comic shop and mooch off some guy's mother.",8,Big Bang Theory,131,26
40373,Howard,15, Your store? My mother gave you the money to reopen. I'm not going anywhere.,8,Big Bang Theory,76,14
40374,Leonard,15, Why don't we go get the food for the party.,8,Big Bang Theory,44,10
40376,Raj,15," Smart, looks like we're being helpful.",8,Big Bang Theory,39,6
40377,Leonard,15," Mmm, when really we're just exiting an uncomfortable situation.",8,Big Bang Theory,64,9
40379,Sheldon,15," Kripke, you know, of all the people, Barry Kripke. I'm so Are you folding that like a crazy person to get me to do it for you?",8,Big Bang Theory,127,27
40380,Penny,15, No.,8,Big Bang Theory,4,1
40381,Sheldon,15," Oh, give me that. Just out of curiosity, if I were to let something go, how would I do that?",8,Big Bang Theory,93,20
40382,Penny,15," I don't know, just think about something else.",8,Big Bang Theory,47,8
40383,Sheldon,15, Can I think about the spiny anteater?,8,Big Bang Theory,38,7
40384,Penny,15, Sure.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
40385,Sheldon,15, The spiny anteater never went behind my back and worked with Barry Kripke. That didn't help at all.,8,Big Bang Theory,100,18
40386,Penny,15," You know, some people try visualization.",8,Big Bang Theory,41,6
40387,Sheldon,15, How does that work?,8,Big Bang Theory,20,4
40388,Penny,15," Okay, imagine your problems are a pen.",8,Big Bang Theory,39,7
40389,Sheldon,15, Okay.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
40390,Penny,15, Now imagine you're holding that pen.,8,Big Bang Theory,37,6
40391,Sheldon,15, Okay.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
40392,Penny,15, Now open your hand and let it go.,8,Big Bang Theory,34,8
40393,Sheldon,15, But I just got this pen. It's got my initials on it and everything. Look.,8,Big Bang Theory,74,15
40394,Penny,15," Sheldon, this isn't that hard.",8,Big Bang Theory,31,5
40395,Sheldon,15, I may have a better way that you can teach me.,8,Big Bang Theory,47,11
40396,Penny,15, How?,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
40397,Sheldon,15, What if I told you that over the past few months Amy has secretly been giving you little puzzles to test your intelligence against chimpanzees in her lab?,8,Big Bang Theory,155,28
40398,Penny,15, What? She didn't give me any puzzles.,8,Big Bang Theory,38,7
40399,Sheldon,15, Are you sure?,8,Big Bang Theory,14,3
40400,Amy,15," Boy, I just can't seem to get these scissors back together. Can you do it?",8,Big Bang Theory,75,15
40401,Amy,15," Darn it. There's something in my eye, and I need to sort these coins by size. Can you help?",8,Big Bang Theory,92,19
40402,Amy,15," Penny? I really want to eat this banana, but it's stuck inside this bamboo puzzle box.",8,Big Bang Theory,87,16
40403,Penny,15, Son of a bitch.,8,Big Bang Theory,16,4
40404,Sheldon,15," Okay, that's great. Now, let it go.",8,Big Bang Theory,36,7
40405,Penny,15, I can't believe you were testing me against a chimp.,8,Big Bang Theory,53,10
40406,Sheldon,15," Well, excuse me, Amy was testing you. I was rooting for you. Good job on that banana box, by the way.",8,Big Bang Theory,102,21
40407,Penny,15, Why would she even do this?,8,Big Bang Theory,28,6
40408,Sheldon,15," She's been conducting an experiment on apes where they're given various puzzles to solve. I was surprised at the complexity of the puzzles and thought some humans wouldn't be able to solve them. That's when Amy said, want to make this interesting?",8,Big Bang Theory,248,42
40409,Penny,15, Make this interesting? You bet money on me?,8,Big Bang Theory,44,8
40410,Sheldon,15," No, no. We designed an experiment involving you. See? Now, isn't that interesting?",8,Big Bang Theory,83,13
40411,Penny,15, It's not interesting. It's incredibly insulting.,8,Big Bang Theory,49,6
40412,Sheldon,15," Okay, maybe this will help. Imagine you're holding a pen. Before you go too far, not a special pen with your initials engraved on it, that'll make the next part really hard.",8,Big Bang Theory,174,32
40413,Penny,15," Oh, my, that's it. Get out.",8,Big Bang Theory,28,6
40414,Sheldon,15," I don't understand why you're mad at me. You should be mad at Amy. Like I was this afternoon. Hey, look at that, I let it go.",8,Big Bang Theory,126,27
40415,Penny,15, Get out.,8,Big Bang Theory,9,2
40416,Sheldon,15, Penny?,8,Big Bang Theory,7,1
40417,Penny,15, What?,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
40418,Sheldon,15, I think I left my pen in there.,8,Big Bang Theory,32,8
40421,Howard,15," It's my mom's furniture. It belongs in the house I grew up in, next to that pile of TV Guides and in plain view of what, for a ten-year-old, was a quality piece of string art.",8,Big Bang Theory,176,36
40423,Howard,15, That is a good point. But I didn't marry you for good points. I married you to blindly support me no matter how ridiculous I'm being.,8,Big Bang Theory,134,26
40426,Leonard,15," Hi, we're here to pick up an order for Comic Center.",8,Big Bang Theory,53,11
40428,Raj,15," Dude, I, I think that's Nathan Fillion.",8,Big Bang Theory,40,7
40429,Leonard,15," Oh yeah, look at that.",8,Big Bang Theory,23,5
40430,Raj,15," And he's picking the tomatoes out of his salad just like I do. I always did feel a connection with him. Oh, I have got an idea.",8,Big Bang Theory,128,27
40431,Leonard,15, We're not selling his tomatoes on eBay.,8,Big Bang Theory,40,7
40432,Raj,15," No, if we got Captain Reynolds from Firefly to do a signing at Stuart's store, that would be amazing.",8,Big Bang Theory,102,19
40433,Leonard,15, That would be great.,8,Big Bang Theory,21,4
40434,Raj,15, So should we go talk to him?,8,Big Bang Theory,29,7
40435,Leonard,15," I don't know. I mean, if he's not nice, it's gonna make it hard for me to watch him in anything again.",8,Big Bang Theory,103,22
40436,Raj,15," What? The, the guy who plays Jon Snow was a jerk. We still watch Game of Thrones.",8,Big Bang Theory,82,17
40437,Leonard,15, He was a jerk because you rear-ended him.,8,Big Bang Theory,42,8
40438,Raj,15," I was distracted. It's weird seeing a member of the Night's Watch with a kayak strapped to his car. Come on. Hi, excuse me, s, sorry, I, I don't mean to bother you, but we're just really big fans of Firefly. And Dr. Horrible.",8,Big Bang Theory,226,44
40440,Raj,15," Don't say that. I mean, you're not Dame Judi Dench, but you're pretty great.",8,Big Bang Theory,77,14
40442,Leonard,15, Come on. Sorry to bother you.,8,Big Bang Theory,30,6
40443,Raj,15," Don't know why he's so grumpy. I got mistaken for that guy in Life of Pi once, and I'm still floating.",8,Big Bang Theory,103,21
40445,Amy,15," Sheldon, it's me.",8,Big Bang Theory,18,3
40446,Penny,15," Oh, hey. Did you see that? I, I figured out how to open the door all by myself. Maybe I'll fling some faeces around my cage to celebrate.",8,Big Bang Theory,138,28
40447,Amy,15, What are you talking about?,8,Big Bang Theory,28,5
40448,Penny,15, I know you've been giving me secret puzzle tests.,8,Big Bang Theory,50,9
40449,Amy,15," Sheldon, open the door.",8,Big Bang Theory,24,4
40450,Sheldon,15, I can't. I'm naked.,8,Big Bang Theory,20,4
40451,Amy,15, I just saw you.,8,Big Bang Theory,16,4
40452,Sheldon,15, Hang on.,8,Big Bang Theory,9,2
40453,Penny,15, Open the door now.,8,Big Bang Theory,19,4
40454,Amy,15," Oh, hey.",8,Big Bang Theory,9,2
40455,Penny,15, Pull up your pants.,8,Big Bang Theory,20,4
40456,Amy,15," It's not a big deal. I run tests like this on undergrads all the time. If you fill out some paperwork at the university, I can get you five dollars.",8,Big Bang Theory,149,30
40457,Penny,15, I don't want five dollars. I want my dignity.,8,Big Bang Theory,46,9
40458,Amy,15," So what are we talking, like, ten bucks?",8,Big Bang Theory,41,8
40460,Leonard,15, Thank you.,8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
40461,Raj,15, Thanks.,8,Big Bang Theory,8,1
40462,Leonard,15, Sorry again.,8,Big Bang Theory,13,2
40464,Raj,15," Are you sure you're not him? Uh, you can tell us. We're scientists, not crazy fanboys.",8,Big Bang Theory,87,16
40466,Raj,15," And you're eating alone at a deli. I don't buy it, you're not him.",8,Big Bang Theory,67,14
40468,Leonard,15, That would be great.,8,Big Bang Theory,21,4
40469,Raj,15, Great.,8,Big Bang Theory,7,1
40470,Leonard,15," Yeah, thank you.",8,Big Bang Theory,17,3
40472,Raj,15," Wait, hang on. If you're really Nathan Fillion, what's the line from Firefly about your bonnet?",8,Big Bang Theory,96,16
40474,Leonard,15," That's it, that's the line.",8,Big Bang Theory,28,5
40475,Raj,15," Although, I knew the line, doesn't make me Nathan Fillion.",8,Big Bang Theory,59,10
40477,Raj,15, I want a picture with Nathan Fillion.,8,Big Bang Theory,38,7
40479,Leonard,15, What do you think?,8,Big Bang Theory,19,4
40480,Raj,15," Ah, it's good enough for Facebook.",8,Big Bang Theory,35,6
40482,Leonard,15, I can't believe they did that.,8,Big Bang Theory,31,6
40483,Penny,15," I know, it's so insulting. At one point, they had me figure out how to get a banana out of a puzzle box.",8,Big Bang Theory,105,23
40484,Leonard,15," Wait, Sheldon gave me a banana in a box. He was testing me, too.",8,Big Bang Theory,65,14
40485,Penny,15, Unbelievable.,8,Big Bang Theory,14,1
40486,Leonard,15, And how could a chimp even solve that? That was impossible.,8,Big Bang Theory,60,11
40487,Penny,15, Really? You couldn't get it out?,8,Big Bang Theory,33,6
40488,Sheldon,15, Thank you.,8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
40489,Amy,15," Wow, the store looks great.",8,Big Bang Theory,28,5
40490,Leonard,15, So you guys were testing us both? What is the matter with you?,8,Big Bang Theory,63,13
40491,Penny,15," Eh, what's the matter with them is they think they're so smart they don't care if they hurt other people's feelings.",8,Big Bang Theory,117,21
40492,Amy,15, That's not true.,8,Big Bang Theory,17,3
40493,Sheldon,15, That sounds like us. I still don't understand why you're upset. You solved every puzzle faster than all of the chimps.,8,Big Bang Theory,119,21
40494,Amy,15," Well, except Barnabas, but he was on Adderall.",8,Big Bang Theory,47,8
40495,Howard,15," I'm sorry, but it's making me crazy.",8,Big Bang Theory,37,7
40497,Sheldon,15," Oh, I can help you with that. Imagine you're holding an ordinary pen. While your favourite pen is safe and secure in your pocket.",8,Big Bang Theory,130,24
40498,Howard,15, Hold that thought.  Hello?,8,Big Bang Theory,27,4
40499,Amy,15, How can I make this up to you?,8,Big Bang Theory,31,8
40500,Penny,15, The answer's in this puzzle box. Let's see if you can open it.,8,Big Bang Theory,63,13
40502,Raj,15, That's what I said when we moved it.,8,Big Bang Theory,37,8
40504,Raj,15," No, Stuart picked out those throw pillows all on his own.",8,Big Bang Theory,58,11
40505,Leonard,15," Hey, you okay?",8,Big Bang Theory,15,3
40506,Howard,15, No.,8,Big Bang Theory,4,1
40507,Leonard,15, What's wrong?,8,Big Bang Theory,14,2
40508,Howard,15, My mom died.,8,Big Bang Theory,13,3
40510,Howard,15," Uh, that was my aunt. Ma took a nap. She never woke up.",8,Big Bang Theory,56,13
40512,Leonard,15, I'm so sorry.,8,Big Bang Theory,14,3
40513,Raj,15, What can we do?,8,Big Bang Theory,16,4
40514,Howard,15, I don't know.,8,Big Bang Theory,14,3
40515,Sheldon,15, May I say something?,8,Big Bang Theory,21,4
40516,Leonard,15," Not right now, Sheldon.",8,Big Bang Theory,24,4
40517,Sheldon,15, But I think it would be comforting.,8,Big Bang Theory,36,7
40518,Leonard,15, Buddy.,8,Big Bang Theory,7,1
40519,Howard,15," No, it's okay. What?",8,Big Bang Theory,21,4
40520,Sheldon,15," When I lost my own father, I didn't have any friends to help me through it. You do.",8,Big Bang Theory,84,18
40521,Penny,15, I really thought he was gonna say let it go.,8,Big Bang Theory,45,10
40523,Raj,15," Okay, thanks, Bernadette. Travel safe. Okay, bye. Well, they've booked a flight. They're heading to the airport now.",8,Big Bang Theory,117,18
40524,Penny,15, How's Howard holding up?,8,Big Bang Theory,25,4
40525,Raj,15, He's hanging in there.,8,Big Bang Theory,23,4
40526,Leonard,15," How are you doing, Stuart?",8,Big Bang Theory,27,5
40528,Amy,15, One of us would have taken you in.,8,Big Bang Theory,35,8
40530,Raj,15," Yeah. Mrs. Wolowitz was pretty special. When I first moved to America, Howard was my only friend and she made me feel so welcome in her home. Which says a lot, because, those first few years, she thought I was the gardener.",8,Big Bang Theory,224,42
40531,Penny,15," Whenever I saw her, she'd say I was too skinny and try and feed me.",8,Big Bang Theory,68,15
40532,Amy,15," She did that to me, too.",8,Big Bang Theory,25,6
40533,Penny,15, Don't take this away from me.,8,Big Bang Theory,30,6
40534,Sheldon,15," I didn't care for her yelling. But now that I'm not going to hear it again, I'm sad.",8,Big Bang Theory,85,18
40535,Leonard,15," If you want, I can yell at you later.",8,Big Bang Theory,38,9
40536,Sheldon,15, It won't be as good.,8,Big Bang Theory,21,5
40537,Leonard,15, Let's have a toast. To Mrs. Wolowitz. A loving mother to all of us. We'll miss you.,8,Big Bang Theory,84,17
40539,Amy,16, I just read about an experiment designed to see if you could make two people fall in love in a matter of hours.,8,Big Bang Theory,112,23
40540,Leonard,16, That doesn't sound right. My research has shown that it takes three to five years of shameless begging.,8,Big Bang Theory,104,18
40541,Penny,16," Honey, neither of us comes off good in that story.",8,Big Bang Theory,51,10
40542,Raj,16," Yeah, I, I, I saw that article you're talking about. Uh, the participants ask each other a series of questions designed to promote intimacy.",8,Big Bang Theory,141,24
40543,Amy,16, And then they finish it off by staring into each other's eyes for four minutes.,8,Big Bang Theory,80,15
40544,Sheldon,16," Oh, that's nonsense. I proclaimed my love for you. And the last time I looked into your eyes was when you thought you had conjunctivitis.",8,Big Bang Theory,138,25
40545,Amy,16," Other than the fact that I had it, that was a magical night.",8,Big Bang Theory,61,13
40546,Penny,16," Raj, would you ever try an experiment like that with Emily?",8,Big Bang Theory,60,11
40547,Raj,16, What? I don't need science to win her heart. I have my family's wealth for that.,8,Big Bang Theory,81,16
40548,Leonard,16," I'm telling you, you can't create love in a few hours. Right?",8,Big Bang Theory,62,12
40549,Penny,16," Oh, careful. You're poking at the whole foundation of The Bachelor.",8,Big Bang Theory,68,11
40550,Sheldon,16," Yeah, but we don't have to debate this. We're scientists. We can conduct our own research. I propose that we imprison two street people and",8,Big Bang Theory,140,25
40551,Amy,16, No.,8,Big Bang Theory,4,1
40552,Sheldon,16, You didn't even let me finish.,8,Big Bang Theory,31,6
40553,Amy,16, Forget it.,8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
40554,Sheldon,16," So, you can experiment on all the apes you want. But I want to manipulate the emotions of two captive human beings, suddenly I'm the monster.",8,Big Bang Theory,142,26
40555,Raj,16, Why don't you just do the test?,8,Big Bang Theory,32,7
40556,Sheldon,16," In the interest of science, I'd be willing to.",8,Big Bang Theory,47,9
40557,Penny,16, What? You're okay with an experiment where you have to answer awkward questions about your innermost feelings?,8,Big Bang Theory,111,17
40558,Sheldon,16, Yes.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
40559,Penny,16," Please, can I do it with him? Please?",8,Big Bang Theory,38,8
40560,Leonard,16," I've been listening to Sheldon's feelings on things for ten years. Tag, you're it.",8,Big Bang Theory,83,14
40561,Raj,16," Yeah, but what if the experiment works?",8,Big Bang Theory,40,7
40562,Penny,16, I'm not gonna fall in love with Sheldon.,8,Big Bang Theory,41,8
40563,Amy,16," That's what I said. Before I knew it, he pontificated his way right into my heart.",8,Big Bang Theory,83,16
40564,Sheldon,16," Uh, fun fact, pontificate comes from the Latin word pontifex, which means bridge builder or Pope.",8,Big Bang Theory,98,16
40565,Leonard,16, In love yet?,8,Big Bang Theory,13,3
40567,Sheldon,16," Just out of curiosity, Penny, if this experiment does make us fall in love, would you drive me to Lake Geneva, Wisconsin for Gary Con? It's the only convention celebrating the life and work of Gary Gygax, the co-creator of Dungeons and Dragons.",8,Big Bang Theory,245,43
40568,Penny,16," You know what? I can honestly say if we fall in love, not only will I drive you there, I will buy you all the dragon T-shirts you want.",8,Big Bang Theory,136,29
40569,Sheldon,16," Okay, babe, let's do this.",8,Big Bang Theory,27,5
40571,Raj,16," You guys are really being calm about Penny and Sheldon doing this thing. If it were me I'd, I'd be a little nervous.",8,Big Bang Theory,117,23
40572,Amy,16, Why?,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
40573,Raj,16," Well, even if the study's nonsense, I don't believe in tempting fate. Same reason I wouldn't use a Ouija board, or pick a fight with an Asian guy. He probably doesn't know karate, but why risk it?",8,Big Bang Theory,197,37
40574,Amy,16, I think we're safe.,8,Big Bang Theory,20,4
40575,Raj,16," Well, that's what the bullies at Bruce Lee's high school thought. And then, bam. Karate.",8,Big Bang Theory,89,15
40576,Leonard,16," Well, are we just gonna sit here while they do the experiment?",8,Big Bang Theory,63,12
40577,Amy,16, The two of us could do it.,8,Big Bang Theory,27,7
40578,Leonard,16," Yeah, sure, that might be fun.",8,Big Bang Theory,31,6
40579,Amy,16, What's the first question?,8,Big Bang Theory,27,4
40580,Raj,16," Hang on. Okay. Given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want as a dinner guest?",8,Big Bang Theory,95,19
40581,Leonard,16, Hmm. I can honestly say Penny.,8,Big Bang Theory,31,6
40582,Amy,16," Oh, then I choose a janitor, 'cause I'm about to throw up.",8,Big Bang Theory,59,12
40583,Leonard,16, I'm in love. Let's do something else.,8,Big Bang Theory,38,7
40584,Raj,16," Ooh, uh, Emily gets off work soon. Why don't the four of us go out?",8,Big Bang Theory,68,15
40585,Leonard,16, Okay.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
40586,Amy,16, Sounds good.,8,Big Bang Theory,13,2
40587,Leonard,16, Should we call Howard and Bernadette?,8,Big Bang Theory,38,6
40588,Raj,16," I don't know what time their plane gets in, but let me, let me shoot them a text.",8,Big Bang Theory,82,18
40589,Amy,16, Did he say anything about the funeral?,8,Big Bang Theory,39,7
40590,Raj,16," Not much, but he seemed to be in a pretty good place.",8,Big Bang Theory,54,12
40592,Howard,16, Are you kidding me? You lost my mother's ashes?,8,Big Bang Theory,48,9
40594,Howard,16," All right, fine. Where did you misroute the only woman who ever loved me? The first, well,",8,Big Bang Theory,91,17
40597,Howard,16, I really did mean first.,8,Big Bang Theory,25,5
40601,Howard,16, The world's greatest mom is in the shoe compartment.,8,Big Bang Theory,53,9
40603,Sheldon,16, You ready to begin?,8,Big Bang Theory,20,4
40604,Penny,16, Yup. Be right there. I assume you don't want wine.,8,Big Bang Theory,51,10
40605,Sheldon,16, Correct. You're not supposed to drink alcohol when operating heavy machinery.,8,Big Bang Theory,78,11
40606,Penny,16, What heavy machinery? Let's just start.,8,Big Bang Theory,40,6
40607,Sheldon,16," Well, as a Texas gentleman, I'm inclined to say ladies first. Although, I'm concerned that level of politeness and charm might make you fall in love with me before the test even begins. Perhaps we should flip a coin. Or if you're familiar with the rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors",8,Big Bang Theory,279,50
40608,Penny,16," Question one. Given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want as a dinner guest?",8,Big Bang Theory,94,18
40609,Sheldon,16, Hmm. Living or dead?,8,Big Bang Theory,21,4
40610,Penny,16, Just says anyone in the world. I guess that means living.,8,Big Bang Theory,58,11
40611,Sheldon,16," Ah, that's just as well. As much as I'd love to meet Euclid, inventor of the geometric proof, he probably wore sandals and I cannot look at toes during dinner. Oh, I know, the person I'd most like to have dinner with is myself.",8,Big Bang Theory,228,44
40612,Penny,16, You sure that's your choice? â€˜Cause I've had that dinner.,8,Big Bang Theory,60,10
40613,Sheldon,16," Well, I haven't. And while they say never meet your heroes, I just don't see how I could disappoint. Who would you choose?",8,Big Bang Theory,123,23
40614,Penny,16," Robert Downey, Jr.",8,Big Bang Theory,19,3
40615,Sheldon,16," Oh, I didn't think of Iron Man. You know, maybe after myself and I have dinner, we can meet you two for dessert.",8,Big Bang Theory,113,23
40617,Raj,16," So, what do you guys want to do?",8,Big Bang Theory,33,8
40618,Amy,16," Well, we're the ones tagging along, you pick.",8,Big Bang Theory,46,8
40620,Leonard,16, What's that?,8,Big Bang Theory,13,2
40622,Raj,16," Oh, so kind of like what's happening with Penny right now.",8,Big Bang Theory,59,11
40624,Sheldon,16, What would constitute a perfect day for you?,8,Big Bang Theory,45,8
40625,Penny,16," Uh, well, I'd probably sleep in, do a little yoga, then lie on the beach while cute cabana boys brought me drinks and probably get a massage and then cap off the night with some dancing.",8,Big Bang Theory,187,36
40626,Sheldon,16, That's it?,8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
40627,Penny,16," Yeah, why?",8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
40628,Sheldon,16, You didn't mention Leonard.,8,Big Bang Theory,28,4
40629,Penny,16, He's there.,8,Big Bang Theory,12,2
40630,Sheldon,16," I don't think so. Leonard can't stand yoga, the beach, massages or dancing.",8,Big Bang Theory,76,13
40631,Penny,16," Yeah, well, he brought a book, okay? What's yours?",8,Big Bang Theory,51,9
40632,Sheldon,16," Uh, I wake up. Uh, I enjoy some French toast with butter and syrup. Uh, then a wormhole opens, and whisks me millions of years into the future where my towering intellect is used to save the last remnants of mankind from a predatory alien race.",8,Big Bang Theory,245,46
40633,Penny,16," Interesting, you didn't mention Amy.",8,Big Bang Theory,37,5
40634,Sheldon,16, Who do you think made the French toast with butter and syrup?,8,Big Bang Theory,62,12
40637,Leonard,16, Ladies?,8,Big Bang Theory,8,1
40639,Leonard,16, Yup.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
40641,Amy,16, Oh.,8,Big Bang Theory,4,1
40642,Leonard,16, This is cool.,8,Big Bang Theory,14,3
40643,Amy,16," So, how do we start?",8,Big Bang Theory,21,5
40645,Raj,16," Uh, wasn't there supposed to be a zombie?",8,Big Bang Theory,42,8
40647,Raj,16," Ooh. Okay, let's hope one of the clues is written on a pair of clean underwear.",8,Big Bang Theory,80,16
40652,Howard,16," So, some stranger has my mom? Is that what you're telling me? My poor mother can be anywhere in Los Angeles right now?",8,Big Bang Theory,119,23
40654,Howard,16," Oh, okay, great. So, your entire job is to find lost luggage, and you've narrowed down the location of my mother to the planet Earth.",8,Big Bang Theory,134,25
40657,Sheldon,16," If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability, what would it be?",8,Big Bang Theory,90,17
40658,Penny,16," Well, not to steal from the Bible, but turning water into wine sounds pretty good.",8,Big Bang Theory,83,15
40659,Sheldon,16, I don't think you're taking this seriously.,8,Big Bang Theory,44,7
40660,Penny,16," Come on, I'm just having some fun with you.",8,Big Bang Theory,44,9
40661,Sheldon,16, I believe what you're doing is using humour to avoid vulnerability.,8,Big Bang Theory,68,11
40662,Penny,16," Fine. Honestly, if I could have one quality, I wish I could be as smart as you guys.",8,Big Bang Theory,85,18
40663,Sheldon,16, Ha. Keep dreaming.,8,Big Bang Theory,19,3
40664,Penny,16, Sheldon.,8,Big Bang Theory,9,1
40666,Penny,16," Well, I can't read people's minds. Actually, that's not true, I can read men's minds, but only 'cause it's usually the one thing.",8,Big Bang Theory,130,23
40667,Sheldon,16, When are we going to get robot eyes?,8,Big Bang Theory,37,8
40668,Penny,16, You're all alike.,8,Big Bang Theory,18,3
40669,Sheldon,16," Well, what I meant was I often misinterpret how others are feeling. Like, I can't always tell if someone is only joking or laughing at me. You know, like, uh, if they're mad at something I've done or just in a bad mood. It, it's incredibly stressful.",8,Big Bang Theory,251,47
40670,Penny,16, Really? You always seem so confident.,8,Big Bang Theory,38,6
40671,Sheldon,16," Well, I'm not. And if I could read people's minds, life would be so much simpler.",8,Big Bang Theory,82,16
40672,Penny,16," Well, now I wish I had the ability to make that stuff easier for you.",8,Big Bang Theory,70,15
40673,Sheldon,16, Thank you.,8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
40674,Penny,16," Wow, I just felt this wave of affection for you.",8,Big Bang Theory,49,10
40675,Sheldon,16, You sure it's not too much Bible juice?,8,Big Bang Theory,40,8
40676,Penny,16, And the wave is gone.,8,Big Bang Theory,22,5
40679,Amy,16," Keep it down, we're working here.",8,Big Bang Theory,34,6
40680,Raj,16," Okay, we've got the cipher decoded.",8,Big Bang Theory,36,6
40682,Amy,16, We used the coordinates to locate the cities.,8,Big Bang Theory,46,8
40683,Leonard,16, I'm putting the city names in the grid now. I'm sure that'll give us the code to the safe.,8,Big Bang Theory,91,19
40685,Leonard,16, Yup. Got the code.,8,Big Bang Theory,19,4
40689,Howard,16," No, I'm not leaving without her.",8,Big Bang Theory,33,6
40691,Howard,16, I could've driven her.,8,Big Bang Theory,23,4
40693,Howard,16, The day she left for Florida. She asked me to drive her to the airport. I was too busy. And I made her take a cab. I was too busy.,8,Big Bang Theory,131,30
40698,Leonard,16, Which book are we looking for?,8,Big Bang Theory,31,6
40699,Raj,16," Uh, Origin of Species.",8,Big Bang Theory,23,4
40700,Leonard,16, Here it is. There's a black light.,8,Big Bang Theory,35,7
40702,Raj,16," Oh, okay. Uh, brothers and sisters I have none, but this man's father is my father's son. Who am I looking at? Yeah, yeah, we get it, you want brains. Calm down.",8,Big Bang Theory,162,32
40703,Amy,16," Well, if I don't have a brother, my father's son is me. And if I'm this man's father, then he's my son. The answer's son.",8,Big Bang Theory,122,25
40705,Leonard,16, I bet the key's behind it.,8,Big Bang Theory,27,6
40708,Amy,16," So, that's the key to the door? That's it?",8,Big Bang Theory,43,9
40709,Leonard,16, We spent two hundred dollars on six minutes of fun?,8,Big Bang Theory,52,10
40710,Raj,16," It's like when you bought that remote-controlled helicopter, and it just flew away.",8,Big Bang Theory,84,13
40712,Amy,16," Well, to be fair, we do all have advanced degrees.",8,Big Bang Theory,51,10
40715,Penny,16," If you were to die this evening with no opportunity to communicate with anyone, what would you most regret not having told someone?",8,Big Bang Theory,132,23
40716,Sheldon,16," So, it would be today? Huh. Well, I suppose there's something satisfying about dying on my birthday.",8,Big Bang Theory,101,17
40717,Penny,16, Today's your birthday?,8,Big Bang Theory,23,3
40718,Sheldon,16, Yes.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
40719,Penny,16," Well, that's always been a secret. Not even Amy knows.",8,Big Bang Theory,55,10
40720,Sheldon,16," Well, I don't enjoy presents. And the thought of people jumping out and yelling surprise fills me with more dread than the words George Lucas Director's Cut.",8,Big Bang Theory,158,27
40721,Penny,16," So, why did you finally tell me?",8,Big Bang Theory,33,7
40722,Sheldon,16, The point of the experiment is to be completely honest with each other.,8,Big Bang Theory,72,13
40723,Penny,16," Well, thank you for sharing it with me. I won't tell anyone.",8,Big Bang Theory,61,12
40724,Sheldon,16, Thank you.,8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
40725,Penny,16, That is so funny. I never would have pegged you for a Pisces.,8,Big Bang Theory,62,13
40726,Sheldon,16, You're making it difficult to love you right now.,8,Big Bang Theory,50,9
40729,Howard,16," Oh, thank God. It's okay, she's here. Ma's here.",8,Big Bang Theory,49,9
40731,Howard,16, Ma? I'm sorry I didn't take you to the airport. I just want you to know that I'll never forgive myself for being so selfish. And I promise to keep you close for the rest of my life.,8,Big Bang Theory,182,38
40734,Sheldon,16, That's it. We're done with the questions.,8,Big Bang Theory,42,7
40735,Penny,16, All that's left to do is stare into each other's eyes for four minutes without talking.,8,Big Bang Theory,88,16
40736,Sheldon,16," Okay. Wait, hang on. Bladder check. We're good to go.",8,Big Bang Theory,54,10
40737,Penny,16, You ready?,8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
40738,Sheldon,16, Yes.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
40739,Penny,16, And begin. This is kind of creepy.,8,Big Bang Theory,35,7
40740,Sheldon,16, We're not supposed to talk during this part.,8,Big Bang Theory,45,8
40741,Penny,16, Sorry.,8,Big Bang Theory,7,1
40742,Sheldon,16, This is kind of creepy.,8,Big Bang Theory,24,5
40743,Penny,16, Do you want to stop? I know you have trouble with eye contact.,8,Big Bang Theory,63,13
40744,Sheldon,16," Well, you have a brown fleck in your right iris that looks like a Formula One race car. So I'm just concentrating on that. Plus, it's easier around people that I'm comfortable with.",8,Big Bang Theory,182,33
40745,Penny,16," Aw, sweetie, I'm comfortable around you, too.",8,Big Bang Theory,46,7
40746,Sheldon,16," Of course you are, I'm warm and soothing. I'm like a human bowl of tomato soup.",8,Big Bang Theory,80,16
40747,Penny,16, I meant more like a little brother.,8,Big Bang Theory,36,7
40748,Sheldon,16," Oh. Well, I suppose I do think of you as a sister. And sometimes, a mother.",8,Big Bang Theory,76,16
40749,Penny,16, It's getting creepy again.,8,Big Bang Theory,27,4
40750,Sheldon,16, What?,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
40751,Penny,16, Just thinking about the day I met you and Leonard.,8,Big Bang Theory,51,10
40752,Sheldon,16, It was a Monday afternoon. You joined us for Indian food.,8,Big Bang Theory,58,11
40753,Penny,16, Can you believe it's been eight years?,8,Big Bang Theory,39,7
40754,Sheldon,16," Yeah, and you're still eating our food.",8,Big Bang Theory,40,7
40755,Penny,16, I can't remember a time you guys weren't in my life.,8,Big Bang Theory,53,11
40756,Sheldon,16," I remember it perfectly. But I have an eidetic memory. If you're interested, I also remember how much you owe us for the food.",8,Big Bang Theory,127,24
40757,Penny,16, That's it. That wasn't so bad.,8,Big Bang Theory,31,6
40758,Sheldon,16," No, it wasn't. Uh, now let's tabulate the results of the experiment. I think it's safe to say that you're not in love with me and I'm not in love with you. And psychology has once again proved itself the doofus of the sciences.",8,Big Bang Theory,228,44
40759,Penny,16," Well, maybe. But I'm still glad we did it. I do feel closer to you.",8,Big Bang Theory,68,15
40760,Sheldon,16," And I, you. And yes, that's how you say that. Yeah, so, given our newfound intimacy, I'd say we have some hard choices to make.",8,Big Bang Theory,128,25
40761,Penny,16, Like what?,8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
40762,Sheldon,16," Gary Con, do we fly or drive? Do we wear costumes? And if so, who gets to be Gary?",8,Big Bang Theory,83,19
40764,Sheldon,16, Thank you for walking me home.,8,Big Bang Theory,31,6
40765,Penny,16, I just want to make sure you get there safe.,8,Big Bang Theory,45,10
40766,Sheldon,16," Well, this is me. It's been a very interesting evening.",8,Big Bang Theory,56,10
40767,Penny,16, It really has.,8,Big Bang Theory,15,3
40769,Sheldon,16, Aah! And after I let you be Gary.,8,Big Bang Theory,34,8
40771,Leonard,17," I was unstoppable. I mean, I was, I was on fire. It was like my mind and my body were totally connected, like, like athletes must feel when they're in the zone.",8,Big Bang Theory,161,32
40772,Penny,17," Again, it was miniature golf.",8,Big Bang Theory,30,5
40773,Leonard,17," Admit it, you're a little turned on.",8,Big Bang Theory,37,7
40774,Penny,17, You can't be this proud.,8,Big Bang Theory,25,5
40775,Leonard,17, Why not?,8,Big Bang Theory,9,2
40776,Penny,17, Because I beat you.,8,Big Bang Theory,20,4
40777,Leonard,17, Hey.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
40778,Penny,17, Hi.,8,Big Bang Theory,4,1
40779,Sheldon,17," Oh, good. You're back.",8,Big Bang Theory,23,4
40780,Amy,17, We have some exciting news.,8,Big Bang Theory,28,5
40781,Leonard,17, Okay.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
40782,Sheldon,17," As you know, Amy and I have been together a long time, and a lot of things I never thought possible now seem possible.",8,Big Bang Theory,119,24
40783,Penny,17, Okay.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
40784,Amy,17," After a careful evaluation of our relationship, we decided that the time was right to take a step forward.",8,Big Bang Theory,107,19
40785,Leonard,17, Okay.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
40786,Sheldon,17, Do you want to say it?,8,Big Bang Theory,23,6
40787,Amy,17, Let's say it together.,8,Big Bang Theory,23,4
40789,Penny,17, This is why I've been saying we should keep champagne on ice.,8,Big Bang Theory,62,12
40790,Sheldon,17, Sarcasm?,8,Big Bang Theory,9,1
40791,Amy,17, Yes.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
40792,Sheldon,17," Okay. That was tricky, 'cause when it comes to alcohol, she generally means business.",8,Big Bang Theory,86,14
40793,Leonard,17," Well, we're, we're very happy for you.",8,Big Bang Theory,39,7
40794,Penny,17, Yes.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
40795,Amy,17, Thank you. Acquiring a joint pet is a big step for us.,8,Big Bang Theory,55,12
40796,Sheldon,17," No. It's true. It means that we care so much about each other, there's enough left over for an eight-ounce reptile.",8,Big Bang Theory,116,21
40797,Leonard,17, Why a turtle?,8,Big Bang Theory,14,3
40798,Sheldon,17," After much deliberation, we've determined that a turtle is the ideal pet. They don't shed fur, they don't make noise.",8,Big Bang Theory,118,20
40799,Amy,17," For Halloween, we can dress him as a cobblestone.",8,Big Bang Theory,50,9
40800,Sheldon,17," Yeah. And if he ever goes berserk, I know I can outrun him. Coincidentally, that's also why I chose you as a roommate.",8,Big Bang Theory,119,23
40801,Leonard,17," Well, congratulations. Who would've thought you two would be the first in our group to start a family?",8,Big Bang Theory,103,18
40802,Penny,17, Mm-hmm.,8,Big Bang Theory,8,1
40803,Amy,17, That's what I said.,8,Big Bang Theory,20,4
40805,Raj,17," So, where's your roommate tonight?",8,Big Bang Theory,35,5
40807,Raj,17," But remember our agreement? You can joke about murdering people, but you have to say just kidding.",8,Big Bang Theory,99,17
40809,Raj,17, That's okay. I can come back later.,8,Big Bang Theory,36,7
40811,Raj,17," Okay, cool. Oh, and you're sure your roommate's not gonna come back while I'm here alone, right? â€˜Cause that'll be awkward.",8,Big Bang Theory,126,21
40813,Raj,17," Oh, good.",8,Big Bang Theory,10,2
40816,Sheldon,17," Oh, dear Lord. Oh, dear Lord.",8,Big Bang Theory,30,6
40817,Amy,17, It's okay. You made it. We're fine.,8,Big Bang Theory,36,7
40818,Sheldon,17, That was a lot of puppies.,8,Big Bang Theory,27,6
40819,Amy,17," Let's forget about them, and pick ourselves out a nice turtle. Oh, how about this one up on the log?",8,Big Bang Theory,101,20
40820,Sheldon,17," Oh, I don't know. He kind of looks like a jerk. How about this one?",8,Big Bang Theory,68,15
40821,Amy,17," Well, he's barely moving. He looks half dead.",8,Big Bang Theory,46,8
40822,Sheldon,17," I know. I like him, too. Hi, little guy. How'd you like to come home with us? You'll be living with me because we don't live in the same house.",8,Big Bang Theory,144,30
40823,Amy,17," But that's not your fault. Like you, we're taking it ridiculously slow. You'll stay with me when he's at Comic-Con or away for work.",8,Big Bang Theory,133,24
40824,Sheldon,17, Or if they accept Daddy's application to live on Mars.,8,Big Bang Theory,55,10
40825,Amy,17, What are you talking about?,8,Big Bang Theory,28,5
40826,Sheldon,17," Oh, there's this company that's attempting to establish a colony on Mars, and I applied to be among the first to go. What should we name him? You know, I came in thinking Seth, but he kind of looks Italian.",8,Big Bang Theory,207,40
40827,Amy,17," You applied for a mission to be a colonist on another planet, and couldn't be bothered to tell me?",8,Big Bang Theory,99,19
40828,Sheldon,17, Would you have approved?,8,Big Bang Theory,25,4
40829,Amy,17, Of course not.,8,Big Bang Theory,15,3
40830,Sheldon,17," Well, based on your reaction, it looks like I made the right choice. Isn't that right, Giuseppe?",8,Big Bang Theory,97,17
40832,Leonard,17," Hey, hey. Listen, I, I have a little confession to make.",8,Big Bang Theory,57,11
40833,Penny,17," Aw, is this your first time?",8,Big Bang Theory,29,6
40834,Leonard,17," No, I got you something for Valentine's Day, and I was too embarrassed to give it to you.",8,Big Bang Theory,90,18
40835,Penny,17," Well, why?",8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
40836,Leonard,17," Well, 'cause I got it at the dirty store.",8,Big Bang Theory,42,9
40837,Penny,17, You went to the dirty store without me?,8,Big Bang Theory,40,8
40838,Leonard,17, In sunglasses and a hat after I parked two blocks away.,8,Big Bang Theory,56,11
40839,Penny,17," Well, get it. Get it for me.",8,Big Bang Theory,29,7
40840,Leonard,17, Yeah?,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
40841,Penny,17, Yeah.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
40842,Leonard,17," Okay, uh, well, I hope it's fun. I mean, it, it comes with paints, and, and it's kind of creative and artistic.",8,Big Bang Theory,112,22
40843,Penny,17," Okay, did you go to the dirty store or Michaels?",8,Big Bang Theory,49,10
40844,Leonard,17," No, no. We cover ourselves in body paint, and then, then we get on this big canvas and do our thing.",8,Big Bang Theory,101,21
40845,Penny,17," Whoa, that's kind of a big step for a guy who only recently agreed to take his socks off.",8,Big Bang Theory,90,19
40846,Leonard,17, You're making fun of me. Forget it.,8,Big Bang Theory,36,7
40847,Penny,17," No. No, come on, I want to do it.",8,Big Bang Theory,34,9
40848,Leonard,17, Really?,8,Big Bang Theory,8,1
40849,Penny,17," Yeah, let's you, me, and your very, very pale feet make some art. Hey, when you got back to this store, I want to go with you.",8,Big Bang Theory,127,27
40850,Leonard,17," Okay, but it's a drive, the one I went to is in San Diego.",8,Big Bang Theory,59,14
40852,Howard,17, How are the taxes going?,8,Big Bang Theory,25,5
40854,Howard,17, Those are business expenses. You can write those off.,8,Big Bang Theory,54,9
40856,Howard,17," Oh, Bernie, you're gonna have to sound a lot more confident when we get audited.  Hey, what's up?",8,Big Bang Theory,98,18
40857,Raj,17," Oh, Emily ran back to the hospital, so I'm just hanging out at her place. What are you, uh, what are you doing?",8,Big Bang Theory,112,23
40858,Howard,17, Just playing video games while Bernie does the taxes.,8,Big Bang Theory,54,9
40859,Raj,17," What are you, a little kid? Is she gonna cut your dinner into little pieces, too?",8,Big Bang Theory,82,16
40860,Howard,17," She doesn't have to, I filled up on jelly beans.",8,Big Bang Theory,49,10
40861,Raj,17," So, uh, what game are you Oh. Crap.",8,Big Bang Theory,36,8
40862,Howard,17, What's wrong?,8,Big Bang Theory,14,2
40863,Raj,17, I can't get Emily's night-stand to close.,8,Big Bang Theory,42,7
40864,Howard,17, So?,8,Big Bang Theory,4,1
40865,Raj,17, She's gonna know I was looking in it.,8,Big Bang Theory,38,8
40866,Howard,17, Why were you looking in it?,8,Big Bang Theory,28,6
40867,Raj,17," Well, there's a question I better have a good answer to before she gets back.",8,Big Bang Theory,78,15
40868,Howard,17," Okay, calm down. There's probably something jammed behind it. Just, uh, pull it out and see what's there.",8,Big Bang Theory,106,18
40869,Raj,17," Hang on. Oh no. Oh, no. Oh, God, no.",8,Big Bang Theory,37,9
40870,Howard,17," You know what, you sound busy, I'm gonna let you go.",8,Big Bang Theory,53,11
40871,Raj,17," Dude, the whole front came off. Now she's gonna know I was snooping.",8,Big Bang Theory,69,13
40873,Howard,17, Raj was snooping through Emily's drawers and broke one.,8,Big Bang Theory,56,9
40876,Penny,17, So what do you think?,8,Big Bang Theory,22,5
40877,Leonard,17," I thought it'd be a little more, just more.",8,Big Bang Theory,44,9
40878,Penny,17," I'm not even sure why we were out of breath. Uh, I mean, did we move at all?",8,Big Bang Theory,77,18
40879,Leonard,17," Maybe along the z-axis, but x and y are looking pretty sad.",8,Big Bang Theory,60,12
40880,Penny,17," Okay, come on. We are not old boring people. We can do better than this.",8,Big Bang Theory,73,15
40881,Leonard,17," Uh, Th, that's true. How late did we stay up last night?",8,Big Bang Theory,57,12
40882,Penny,17, Almost 1am.,8,Big Bang Theory,12,2
40883,Leonard,17," Damn straight, almost 1am. And we weren't even watching TV. We were watching Netflix, like the kids do.",8,Big Bang Theory,104,18
40884,Penny,17," Yeah, is it a comedy? Is it a drama? Nobody knows. Now, come on. We are gonna do this.",8,Big Bang Theory,87,19
40885,Leonard,17," Yeah. You get the paint, I'll rest for 30 to 40 minutes, and then we do this.",8,Big Bang Theory,78,17
40887,Sheldon,17, I can't believe you almost had me bring a wild animal into my home.,8,Big Bang Theory,68,14
40888,Amy,17, No one told you to poke the turtle's face.,8,Big Bang Theory,43,9
40889,Sheldon,17, I was playing Got Your Nose. That's how you get children to like you.,8,Big Bang Theory,70,14
40890,Amy,17," I'm surprised you even care if he likes you, since you're planning on leaving the planet the first chance you get.",8,Big Bang Theory,115,21
40891,Sheldon,17," Ugh, this again. Amy, I've already had one new hole torn in my body today. I don't need another one.",8,Big Bang Theory,101,20
40892,Amy,17," Sheldon, I know the odds of you even going to Mars are incredibly small, but it still hurts that you would volunteer for something that would take you away from me forever.",8,Big Bang Theory,173,32
40893,Sheldon,17, So you're saying you wouldn't leave me for the chance to be one of the first humans to colonize another planet?,8,Big Bang Theory,112,21
40894,Amy,17, I would at least mention it before filling out the application.,8,Big Bang Theory,64,11
40895,Sheldon,17," Huh, that's exactly what Leonard, Wolowitz, Koothrappali, Bernadette and Penny said.",8,Big Bang Theory,85,11
40896,Amy,17," And who says you could even survive an interplanetary mission, anyway? You could barely survive a tiny turtle bite.",8,Big Bang Theory,116,19
40897,Sheldon,17," First of all, this has only made me stronger. But beyond that, all I did was fill out an application.",8,Big Bang Theory,102,20
40898,Amy,17," You know what? Go to Mars, Sheldon.",8,Big Bang Theory,36,7
40899,Sheldon,17, Is there anything I can do to cheer you up?,8,Big Bang Theory,44,10
40900,Amy,17, No. Forget it.,8,Big Bang Theory,15,3
40901,Sheldon,17, What if I play the Star Trek theme on my nose?,8,Big Bang Theory,47,11
40902,Amy,17, Please don't.,8,Big Bang Theory,14,2
40903,Sheldon,17," Yep, you're mad.",8,Big Bang Theory,17,3
40905,Howard,17," Okay, let me see the damage.",8,Big Bang Theory,29,6
40906,Raj,17, Hang on.,8,Big Bang Theory,9,2
40907,Howard,17," Well, I think you broke the dowels. You're not gonna have time to glue it back on, you'll have to nail it.",8,Big Bang Theory,107,22
40908,Raj,17, With what?,8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
40909,Howard,17, Does she have any pillows or wine glasses?,8,Big Bang Theory,43,8
40910,Raj,17, She does.,8,Big Bang Theory,10,2
40911,Howard,17, Great. Neither of those. Try a hammer.,8,Big Bang Theory,39,7
40912,Raj,17, Did that feel good? You feel like a big man now?,8,Big Bang Theory,49,11
40914,Sheldon,17," I was going to make you red zinger, but since Mars is the red planet, I went with peppermint.",8,Big Bang Theory,94,19
40915,Amy,17, Why do you even want to do this?,8,Big Bang Theory,33,8
40916,Sheldon,17," Actually, as part of the application, I was required to make a short video answering that very question. You want to see it?",8,Big Bang Theory,125,23
40917,Amy,17, Can't you just tell me?,8,Big Bang Theory,24,5
40918,Sheldon,17, But I made a video.,8,Big Bang Theory,20,5
40919,Sheldon,17," I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and I'd like to tell you why I should be chosen to go to Mars. I'm exceedingly smart. I graduated college at 14. While my brother was getting an STD I was getting a PhD. Penicillin can't take this away. Being in close quarters, cleanliness is important and my hygiene is impeccable. In fact, animals don't trust me because I smell like nothing. Literally nothing. During the seven-month space flight, I can keep up morale with my wacky sense of humour. Hey, Leonard, is there any peanut brittle left in that can?",8,Big Bang Theory,537,96
40920,Leonard,17, You mean this weirdly suspicious one?,8,Big Bang Theory,38,6
40921,Sheldon,17, Yes. Open it and check.,8,Big Bang Theory,24,5
40922,Leonard,17, I don't get it. There's actually peanut brittle in Please go to Mars.,8,Big Bang Theory,70,13
40923,Sheldon,17," But on a more serious note, the most important reason I want to go to Mars is that I believe, as a scientist, it's my duty to push the boundaries of human knowledge forward. Now, I know that life on Mars will be difficult. But life here on Earth is no picnic. Also, picnics are no picnic. Where should we go for lunch? Oh, I know, the ground. In conclusion, thank you for considering me for this journey of a lifetime. To Mars.",8,Big Bang Theory,428,83
40924,Sheldon,17," Afterwards, Leonard blew his nose, and pie came out.",8,Big Bang Theory,53,9
40926,Leonard,17," Right there, right there, Oh, God, that's it.",8,Big Bang Theory,46,8
40927,Penny,17, How did you get paint in your eye?,8,Big Bang Theory,35,8
40928,Leonard,17, Because you wouldn't let me wear safety goggles.,8,Big Bang Theory,49,8
40930,Raj,17," This looks terrible. She, she's gonna know.",8,Big Bang Theory,44,7
40931,Howard,17, It's fine. You just need two more nails.,8,Big Bang Theory,41,8
40932,Raj,17," Okay, where should I put them?",8,Big Bang Theory,31,6
40933,Howard,17, In Emily's eyes.,8,Big Bang Theory,17,3
40934,Raj,17, You're not helping.,8,Big Bang Theory,20,3
40936,Raj,17," You know, it, it's bad enough that I have to deal with this",8,Big Bang Theory,60,13
40938,Raj,17," Oh, no. Hey.",8,Big Bang Theory,13,3
40940,Raj,17, How was the hospital?,8,Big Bang Theory,22,4
40942,Raj,17," Uh w, well, okay, look, I, I don't want to lie to you. I got curious, I was looking around and I broke the drawer on your night stand.",8,Big Bang Theory,135,29
40944,Raj,17, Yeah.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
40946,Raj,17, You've never snooped around my apartment?,8,Big Bang Theory,42,6
40948,Raj,17," Come on, think back. It would really help if you had.",8,Big Bang Theory,54,11
40951,Howard,17, We should hang up.,8,Big Bang Theory,19,4
40953,Howard,17," But we're not going to, are we?",8,Big Bang Theory,32,7
40955,Howard,17, What happened to snooping is wrong?,8,Big Bang Theory,36,6
40958,Leonard,17," Well, we did it.",8,Big Bang Theory,17,4
40959,Penny,17, We sure did.,8,Big Bang Theory,13,3
40960,Leonard,17," I mean, I was on fire. I, I was in the zone, like an athlete.",8,Big Bang Theory,62,15
40961,Penny,17," Sweetie, I beat you at this, too.",8,Big Bang Theory,34,7
40962,Leonard,17," So, where do we want to hang it?",8,Big Bang Theory,33,8
40963,Penny,17, What? Are you kidding? We're not hanging it.,8,Big Bang Theory,45,8
40964,Leonard,17, But it's an expression of our love.,8,Big Bang Theory,36,7
40965,Penny,17, And our butts. Not hanging it.,8,Big Bang Theory,31,6
40966,Leonard,17, Seems a shame to throw it away.,8,Big Bang Theory,32,7
40967,Penny,17," Yeah. We could give it to Sheldon, and tell him William Shatner painted it.",8,Big Bang Theory,76,14
40968,Leonard,17," God, I love you. I love you so much.",8,Big Bang Theory,37,9
40970,Amy,17, I think I'm gonna go home.,8,Big Bang Theory,27,6
40971,Sheldon,17, Why? I really don't understand what's happening here.,8,Big Bang Theory,54,8
40972,Amy,17," You know, Sheldon, at any other time, learning that you had plans to go live on Mars would be a slow news day. But a couple of hours ago, we were getting a turtle. And silly as it sounds, I thought that meant something.",8,Big Bang Theory,220,44
40973,Sheldon,17," Amy. Oh, why didn't I give her Sleepy Time tea? Amy, wait. Getting a turtle meant a great deal to me, too.",8,Big Bang Theory,107,22
40974,Amy,17, Sure. Unless something better comes along.,8,Big Bang Theory,43,6
40975,Sheldon,17, Do you want me to withdraw my application?,8,Big Bang Theory,43,8
40976,Amy,17, What I want is for us to be planning our future together.,8,Big Bang Theory,58,12
40977,Sheldon,17," And in that future, are we on the same planet? Because I've seen people make the long-distance thing work.",8,Big Bang Theory,107,19
40978,Amy,17, We're on the same planet.,8,Big Bang Theory,26,5
40979,Sheldon,17, Okay. Does that planet have to be Earth?,8,Big Bang Theory,41,8
40980,Amy,17, Are you asking me to go to Mars with you?,8,Big Bang Theory,42,10
40981,Sheldon,17," I am. Yeah, if I'm going to a barren, lifeless environment where the chances of survival are slim to none, I want you there with me. Why don't we go back to the apartment, and fill out your application?",8,Big Bang Theory,203,39
40982,Amy,17, Okay. I suppose being the first people on a new planet would be incredibly exciting.,8,Big Bang Theory,85,15
40983,Sheldon,17," Oh, I know. We could be the first to plant a flag on Mars. We could be the first to watch Mars Attacks! on Mars. We could be the first to say good lord, what on Mars are you talking about?",8,Big Bang Theory,189,41
40984,Amy,17," You know, we could also be the first people to procreate on Mars.",8,Big Bang Theory,66,13
40985,Sheldon,17," You just can't keep it in your space pants, can you?",8,Big Bang Theory,53,11
40986,Amy,17," Think about it. If we had a family there, our kids would be Martians.",8,Big Bang Theory,70,14
40987,Sheldon,17," They would, wouldn't they? We could give them cool Martian names. And we could teach them about Martian history. Like, who planted those flags? And, uh, where did that copy of Mars Attacks! come from?",8,Big Bang Theory,201,35
40988,Amy,17," I guess we'll have to make a new video together, as a couple.",8,Big Bang Theory,62,13
40989,Sheldon,17," Good idea. And since you've had such a rough day, I'm gonna let you throw the pie in Leonard's face.",8,Big Bang Theory,101,20
40991,Raj,17, Thank you for forgiving me.,8,Big Bang Theory,28,5
40993,Raj,17," Well, it almost happened when you called my apple pie crust doughy, but the truth is you were right, and I was just angry at myself.",8,Big Bang Theory,133,26
40995,Raj,17, Of course. What?,8,Big Bang Theory,17,3
40997,Raj,17, No. Just the drawer.,8,Big Bang Theory,21,4
40999,Raj,17," I promise. Why, what's in there?",8,Big Bang Theory,33,6
41002,Sheldon,18," Two one six four two zero one nine eight nine. And that, little lady, is pi to a thousand places.",8,Big Bang Theory,98,20
41003,Amy,18," I'd say I'm sorry I asked, except I didn't.",8,Big Bang Theory,44,9
41004,Sheldon,18," Oh, look, it's the Scientific American that covered the paper Leonard and I wrote.",8,Big Bang Theory,83,14
41005,Amy,18," Oh, let me see.",8,Big Bang Theory,16,4
41006,Sheldon,18, I have mixed feelings about doing interviews. I like the part where I talk. I do not like the part where the other man talks.,8,Big Bang Theory,126,25
41007,Amy,18," Sheldon, this article doesn't mention Leonard at all.",8,Big Bang Theory,54,8
41008,Sheldon,18," Well, that can't be right.",8,Big Bang Theory,27,5
41009,Amy,18, It only refers to Dr. Cooper and his team. Did you even talk about him?,8,Big Bang Theory,72,15
41010,Sheldon,18, All I did was answer a few questions about the theory. And then expressed my gratitude that Scientific American doesn't include any of those smelly perfume cards.,8,Big Bang Theory,163,27
41011,Amy,18, Poor Leonard.,8,Big Bang Theory,14,2
41012,Sheldon,18, Why? The theory he came up with just got mentioned in Scientific American. He ought to be thrilled.,8,Big Bang Theory,100,18
41013,Amy,18, He might not be.,8,Big Bang Theory,17,4
41014,Sheldon,18," Oh, maybe you're right. He is kind of a lump.",8,Big Bang Theory,46,10
41015,Amy,18, Think about it. How would you feel if you were referred to as part of Leonard's team?,8,Big Bang Theory,86,17
41016,Sheldon,18," Oh, I'd be incensed.",8,Big Bang Theory,21,4
41017,Amy,18, So you see what I'm getting at?,8,Big Bang Theory,32,7
41018,Sheldon,18, Squeaky wheel gets the grease?,8,Big Bang Theory,31,5
41019,Amy,18, No.,8,Big Bang Theory,4,1
41020,Sheldon,18, Grass is always greener?,8,Big Bang Theory,25,4
41021,Amy,18, Try again.,8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
41022,Sheldon,18," Well, I don't know, we're all Groot? Just tell me.",8,Big Bang Theory,51,10
41023,Amy,18," Leonard is as much a part of this paper as you are, and he was overlooked. He's going to feel bad.",8,Big Bang Theory,99,21
41024,Sheldon,18, But it wasn't my fault. I didn't exclude him. And I didn't write the article.,8,Big Bang Theory,78,15
41025,Amy,18, Remember that time you didn't get picked to pull the sword out of the stone at Disneyland and they let that other kid do it?,8,Big Bang Theory,125,25
41026,Sheldon,18," Oh, that kid. Poor Leonard.",8,Big Bang Theory,28,5
41027,Amy,18, Exactly.,8,Big Bang Theory,9,1
41028,Sheldon,18," For the record, that kid was a terrible choice. If you cry when you drop your churro, you do not have what it takes to rule England.",8,Big Bang Theory,133,27
41030,Howard,18, Thanks for helping us sort through all my mom's stuff.,8,Big Bang Theory,55,10
41031,Raj,18," Of course. I know what it's like having to go through a loved one's possessions. My uncle was a worshipper of Krishna. But after he died, you know what we found? A statue of Shiva. It may not be Crips and Bloods, okay? But in India, it's a thing.",8,Big Bang Theory,247,49
41033,Howard,18," Well, it's hard. A lot of Ma's stuff brings back fond memories.",8,Big Bang Theory,64,12
41035,Howard,18," Yes. It reminds me of us eating out and her saying quick, nobody's looking, fill your pockets with ketchup.",8,Big Bang Theory,108,19
41037,Sheldon,18, Leonard? Have you ever noticed that only my name is on the cable bill?,8,Big Bang Theory,71,14
41038,Leonard,18, Yeah.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
41039,Sheldon,18," Good, good. And your name is on the electric bill and mine isn't. And I'm okay with that.",8,Big Bang Theory,90,18
41040,Leonard,18," Actually, your name is on the electric bill.",8,Big Bang Theory,45,8
41041,Sheldon,18," Oh, right. This is a disaster.",8,Big Bang Theory,31,6
41042,Leonard,18, I don't even know what you're talking about and I agree.,8,Big Bang Theory,57,11
41043,Sheldon,18," Okay, I have to tell you something, but you're not going to like it.",8,Big Bang Theory,69,14
41044,Leonard,18, What's going on?,8,Big Bang Theory,17,3
41045,Sheldon,18, An article was just published in Scientific American about our theory.,8,Big Bang Theory,71,11
41046,Leonard,18, Did they hate it?,8,Big Bang Theory,18,4
41047,Sheldon,18," No. No, they loved it. They, uh, couldn't say enough nice things about it.",8,Big Bang Theory,75,14
41048,Leonard,18, So what's the problem?,8,Big Bang Theory,23,4
41049,Sheldon,18, You know how the PennySaver only has my name,8,Big Bang Theory,45,9
41050,Leonard,18, Sheldon.,8,Big Bang Theory,9,1
41051,Sheldon,18, They didn't mention you in the article. Only me.,8,Big Bang Theory,49,9
41052,Leonard,18, Really?,8,Big Bang Theory,8,1
41053,Sheldon,18," I know. It's not fair. Let the anger go, buddy. You just, you relax all your muscles. Except for your pubococcygeus and anal sphincter. Let's keep those tight.",8,Big Bang Theory,160,28
41054,Leonard,18," Uh, that, that's not necessary.",8,Big Bang Theory,32,5
41055,Sheldon,18," It is. They're what hold back the urine and the faeces. Look, maybe, maybe you shouldn't read it. It'll only make you feel worse.",8,Big Bang Theory,130,24
41056,Leonard,18, Cooper and his team?,8,Big Bang Theory,21,4
41057,Sheldon,18, You should know I had nothing to do with that.,8,Big Bang Theory,47,10
41058,Leonard,18," Uh, at least they're talking about the theory. I mean, that's what's important.",8,Big Bang Theory,80,13
41059,Sheldon,18," You know, you're right. Yeah. You know, it's like when Stan Lee and Steve Ditko created Spider-Man. Stan Lee may get all the credit, but Steve Ditko knows he was just as important. Even though Stan Lee gets to be in all the Marvel movies. And. and he's far richer. And he's a household name, you know? Whereas, you know, you say Ditko, and that sounds like a company that makes Dits.",8,Big Bang Theory,384,72
41060,Leonard,18, That's not helping.,8,Big Bang Theory,20,3
41061,Sheldon,18," Well, I'd give more examples, but, well, everyone in your position's so forgettable.",8,Big Bang Theory,85,13
41063,Howard,18," Stuart, we're here.",8,Big Bang Theory,20,3
41064,Raj,18, It's nice of you to let him keep staying at your mom's house.,8,Big Bang Theory,62,13
41065,Howard,18," Yeah, well, I tried putting him out on the curb, but nobody took him.",8,Big Bang Theory,70,14
41069,Howard,18," Wait, when did it go out?",8,Big Bang Theory,26,6
41071,Howard,18," Oh, my God.",8,Big Bang Theory,12,3
41073,Howard,18, It's all defrosting.,8,Big Bang Theory,21,3
41075,Howard,18," It's not just food. This is the last food my mother ever made. This is her last brisket. This is her last meatloaf. This is her last. I have no idea what this is, but it's the last one.",8,Big Bang Theory,186,39
41076,Raj,18, Everything okay?,8,Big Bang Theory,17,2
41077,Howard,18, No. All Ma's food is gonna be ruined.,8,Big Bang Theory,38,8
41079,Raj,18," You don't want to do that. Refreezing not only removes moisture, but it creates ice crystals in the fibres of the meat that can compromise its taste and texture. What? I saw a teachable moment. I dropped some culinary science.",8,Big Bang Theory,227,40
41081,Howard,18, I'll tell you exactly what we're gonna do. We're gonna eat it.,8,Big Bang Theory,63,12
41083,Howard,18, All you said was I had to get rid of things. You didn't say they couldn't pass through my colon first.,8,Big Bang Theory,103,21
41085,Howard,18, Okay. Then how about this? Let's invite everyone over to dinner. It'll be like Ma's feeding us one last time.,8,Big Bang Theory,110,20
41087,Raj,18," Me, too. Oh, look, we've got enough ketchup to cover every ounce of it.",8,Big Bang Theory,72,14
41089,Penny,18," I mean, who even reads Scientific American?",8,Big Bang Theory,44,7
41090,Leonard,18, It's kind of a big deal.,8,Big Bang Theory,25,6
41091,Penny,18," If it's such a big deal, how come the biggest celebrity they could get for the cover is a molecule?",8,Big Bang Theory,100,20
41092,Leonard,18, Can we please just stop talking about it?,8,Big Bang Theory,42,8
41093,Penny,18, I'm sorry. What can I do?,8,Big Bang Theory,26,6
41094,Leonard,18," Nothing, I'm fine.",8,Big Bang Theory,19,3
41095,Penny,18," No, no. I'm gonna cheer you up. Here we go.",8,Big Bang Theory,44,10
41096,Leonard,18, What are we doing?,8,Big Bang Theory,19,4
41097,Penny,18, I am taking you shopping.,8,Big Bang Theory,26,5
41098,Leonard,18, Oh.,8,Big Bang Theory,4,1
41099,Penny,18," My baby is sad, and I'm gonna make him happy again.",8,Big Bang Theory,52,11
41100,Leonard,18," Look, I know shopping cheers you up, but it's just not really my thing.",8,Big Bang Theory,72,14
41101,Penny,18," Well, what about this helicopter you control with an iPad?",8,Big Bang Theory,59,10
41102,Leonard,18, Does it have a camera in it?,8,Big Bang Theory,29,7
41103,Penny,18, It does have a camera in it.,8,Big Bang Theory,29,7
41104,Leonard,18, Baby's listening.,8,Big Bang Theory,18,2
41105,Sheldon,18,  Leonard?  Leonard?  Leonard?,8,Big Bang Theory,30,3
41106,Leonard,18, What?,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
41107,Sheldon,18, I spoke to the reporter at the magazine.,8,Big Bang Theory,41,8
41108,Leonard,18, What happened? Did you tell him it was my idea?,8,Big Bang Theory,48,10
41109,Sheldon,18, I did.,8,Big Bang Theory,7,2
41110,Leonard,18, Thank you. What did he say?,8,Big Bang Theory,28,6
41111,Sheldon,18, He said they made the editorial decision to only cite the lead scientist.,8,Big Bang Theory,74,13
41112,Leonard,18, Why did he think you're the lead scientist? It was my idea.,8,Big Bang Theory,60,12
41113,Penny,18," You know, for an extra four bucks, I can have this thing here tomorrow.",8,Big Bang Theory,72,14
41114,Sheldon,18," Well, I know it was your idea, but the reporter said he's been following my work for a while, and the only reason they even mentioned it in the magazine is 'cause my name is on it.",8,Big Bang Theory,181,37
41115,Penny,18, You know what? I did it. What's four bucks?,8,Big Bang Theory,44,9
41116,Leonard,18," If you're trying to make me feel better, it's not working.",8,Big Bang Theory,59,11
41117,Sheldon,18, Well then what if I told you that I added your name to the cable bill?,8,Big Bang Theory,71,16
41118,Leonard,18, No.,8,Big Bang Theory,4,1
41119,Sheldon,18," Oh. That's just as well. They had me on hold for 20 minutes and I hung up.  Leonard?  Leonard?  Leonard? Also, Wolowitz invited us all to dinner, so I'm ready whenever you are.",8,Big Bang Theory,177,33
41121,Sheldon,18, All he had was an idea.,8,Big Bang Theory,24,6
41122,Amy,18," Well, that is an important part.",8,Big Bang Theory,33,6
41123,Sheldon,18," Oh, please. I have ideas all day long. Reverse SeaWorld where dolphins are allowed to pet people. A new clothing size between medium and large called Marge. Snow White retold from the point of view of Sneezy. Why won't Doc prescribe him something? We finally find out.",8,Big Bang Theory,269,47
41124,Amy,18, But Leonard's idea was good.,8,Big Bang Theory,29,5
41125,Sheldon,18," Fine. Then Grumpy, what's he so grumpy about? Maybe his girlfriend won't take his side.",8,Big Bang Theory,88,15
41127,Leonard,18, I'm the one who thought of it.,8,Big Bang Theory,31,7
41128,Penny,18," Well, didn't he do a lot of the work?",8,Big Bang Theory,38,9
41129,Leonard,18, Yeah. But now he's happy to let people think he's responsible for everything.,8,Big Bang Theory,78,13
41130,Penny,18, And that's why you get an iPad helicopter.,8,Big Bang Theory,43,8
41132,Sheldon,18, Is it my fault I have a much bigger reputation than he does?,8,Big Bang Theory,61,13
41133,Amy,18, It's not your fault.,8,Big Bang Theory,21,4
41134,Sheldon,18, Is it my fault that my name came first on the paper alphabetically?,8,Big Bang Theory,68,13
41135,Amy,18, Not your fault.,8,Big Bang Theory,16,3
41136,Sheldon,18, Is it my fault that when the reporter cited me as the lead scientist I didn't correct him?,8,Big Bang Theory,91,18
41137,Amy,18," Hey, look at that pretty bird.",8,Big Bang Theory,31,6
41139,Leonard,18, He always needs all the attention. He's such a baby.,8,Big Bang Theory,53,10
41140,Penny,18," I know, I know.",8,Big Bang Theory,16,4
41141,Leonard,18," I swear, he is never ever playing with my helicopter.",8,Big Bang Theory,54,10
41143,Raj,18," Okay, I'll start heating some of this stuff up.",8,Big Bang Theory,48,9
41145,Howard,18," Oh, man. This is the boutonniere from my high school prom. A piece of cake from my Bar Mitzvah.",8,Big Bang Theory,96,19
41147,Howard,18," No. If I find my foreskin, I'm gonna kill myself.",8,Big Bang Theory,50,10
41148,Raj,18," Okay, so we've got, um, three briskets, four meatloafs, one lasagna.",8,Big Bang Theory,69,11
41149,Howard,18," No, that's noodle kugel.",8,Big Bang Theory,25,4
41150,Raj,18," One Jewish lasagna, two pound cakes that are about eight pounds each, and one giant container of matzoh ball soup.",8,Big Bang Theory,115,20
41151,Howard,18," Ma always kept it on hand, in case I got sick. She thought she could cure anything with her cooking. Even the time I got food poisoning. From her cooking.",8,Big Bang Theory,155,30
41153,Howard,18," Yeah, I'm okay. Let's get started.",8,Big Bang Theory,35,6
41154,Raj,18, You got it.,8,Big Bang Theory,12,3
41155,Howard,18, I'm never gonna talk to her again.,8,Big Bang Theory,35,7
41157,Howard,18, No. I want to do this.,8,Big Bang Theory,23,6
41159,Howard,18, Okay.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
41160,Raj,18, I'm not making any promises.,8,Big Bang Theory,29,5
41163,Leonard,18, Of course.,8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
41164,Penny,18," Wow, it looks really pretty in here.",8,Big Bang Theory,37,7
41166,Leonard,18," So, Stuart, have you thought about what you'd do if Howard sells the house?",8,Big Bang Theory,76,14
41168,Sheldon,18," Hi. Hello. Oh, and a special hello to Leonard, who needs to be mentioned by name.",8,Big Bang Theory,82,16
41169,Leonard,18, Subtle.,8,Big Bang Theory,8,1
41170,Sheldon,18," But you got it, right?",8,Big Bang Theory,23,5
41171,Howard,18," Hey, guys.",8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
41173,Howard,18," I just want everyone to know, uh, tonight's not a sad occasion.",8,Big Bang Theory,64,12
41175,Howard,18," Good food, good friends, and sometime around midnight, heartburn that makes you pray for death.",8,Big Bang Theory,96,15
41176,Amy,18, Do you need any help in the kitchen?,8,Big Bang Theory,37,8
41178,Penny,18," All right, hey, you two, we're here for Howard right now, okay?",8,Big Bang Theory,64,12
41179,Amy,18," Yes, so please behave yourselves.",8,Big Bang Theory,34,5
41180,Leonard,18, Fine.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
41181,Sheldon,18, Of course.,8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
41184,Penny,18, This food is amazing.,8,Big Bang Theory,22,4
41185,Raj,18," Mm, and not a vegetable in sight.",8,Big Bang Theory,34,7
41186,Howard,18, That's not true. We've got tomatoes right here.,8,Big Bang Theory,48,8
41187,Amy,18, All these bright people sitting around a table by candlelight. Feels like we could be an 18th century French salon.,8,Big Bang Theory,116,20
41188,Sheldon,18," Indeed. Penny, a salon is a gathering where intellectuals entertained each other with sparkling conversations about issues of the day.",8,Big Bang Theory,135,20
41189,Penny,18," Oh, so it's like The View.",8,Big Bang Theory,27,6
41190,Amy,18," Sheldon, The View is a daytime talk show hosted by women.",8,Big Bang Theory,58,11
41191,Penny,18, Shut up.,8,Big Bang Theory,9,2
41192,Raj,18, I would like to propose a salon topic.,8,Big Bang Theory,39,8
41193,Amy,18," Ooh, please do, Rajesh.",8,Big Bang Theory,24,4
41194,Raj,18, The lead in The Hunger Games is a woman. Marvel has made Tor a female.,8,Big Bang Theory,71,15
41195,Penny,18," Wait, who's Tor?",8,Big Bang Theory,17,3
41196,Raj,18," You know, Tor, the God of Tunder. As I was saying, is this a sign that our society is approaching gender equality?",8,Big Bang Theory,115,22
41197,Howard,18, Certainly a lot more women are reading comic books now.,8,Big Bang Theory,56,10
41199,Amy,18, We won't know if there's equality until female Thor has a baby and the Avengers are cool with her pumping breast milk at work.,8,Big Bang Theory,127,24
41200,Howard,18, I wonder if only a baby who is worthy can suckle at the bosom of Thor.,8,Big Bang Theory,71,16
41201,Penny,18," Okay, new salon topic. Salons, dumb thing from a long time ago or interesting thing made dumb by talking about superheroes? Discuss.",8,Big Bang Theory,133,22
41202,Sheldon,18, I don't believe it matters what the topic is. What's crucial for a salon is that we conduct the discussion in an elevated and insightful way. It's all about the execution.,8,Big Bang Theory,172,31
41203,Leonard,18," Of course you'd focus on that rather than the inspiration. Uh, new salon topic. What's more important, an idea or its execution?",8,Big Bang Theory,129,22
41205,Sheldon,18," Yeah, good for you, Leonard. That's a lovely little notion. Kind of like, I wish I could talk to my uncle in Chicago. Yeah, now stand back while I invent the telephone. Hello? Oh, hold on. Leonard, it's your uncle. He says you just got burned.",8,Big Bang Theory,244,46
41206,Amy,18, Sheldon.,8,Big Bang Theory,9,1
41207,Penny,18, Guys.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
41208,Leonard,18," No, it's okay. We're all adults trying to have an intelligent discussion. At least I am. Howard, what do you think?",8,Big Bang Theory,116,21
41209,Howard,18," Well, I guess, as an engineer, I lean towards execution. I spend my days trying to take ideas and make them real.",8,Big Bang Theory,114,22
41210,Sheldon,18," Well said, old chap. I thought eloquence had died, here it stands before us. Starting today, it'll go Gettysburg Address, I have a dream, and what he just said.",8,Big Bang Theory,161,29
41211,Leonard,18," Oh, now he's a genius? All you ever do is make fun of him and engineering.",8,Big Bang Theory,75,16
41212,Sheldon,18," Leonard, please. His mother just died.",8,Big Bang Theory,39,6
41213,Leonard,18, You're being ridiculous.,8,Big Bang Theory,25,3
41214,Sheldon,18," Yeah, so are you.",8,Big Bang Theory,18,4
41215,Penny,18," Guys, if I wanted to hear people be bitchy, I'd go to my real salon.",8,Big Bang Theory,69,15
41216,Sheldon,18," Leonard, lots of people could've had that idea, but very few people could've worked out the math the way I did.",8,Big Bang Theory,112,21
41217,Leonard,18," Lots of people also didn't have that idea, like everyone in the entire world except for me.",8,Big Bang Theory,92,17
41218,Sheldon,18," Oh, well, apparently Leonard thinks he's better than everyone in the whole world, including those fighting for our freedom. Yeah, well, I don't know about you, but I support our boys overseas.",8,Big Bang Theory,193,32
41219,Amy,18, And girls.,8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
41220,Sheldon,18," Hey, you already ruined Thor, give it a rest.",8,Big Bang Theory,46,9
41221,Leonard,18, So I'm just supposed to be okay with you hogging all the credit?,8,Big Bang Theory,65,13
41222,Sheldon,18, I didn't hog anything. Unlike you and that weird lasagna with raisins in it.,8,Big Bang Theory,77,14
41223,Leonard,18, You want some of this? I'll give you some.,8,Big Bang Theory,43,9
41225,Sheldon,18," She said my name first, that must kill you.",8,Big Bang Theory,44,9
41227,Howard,18, You guys ever notice sometimes Bernadette sounds like my mom?,8,Big Bang Theory,62,10
41228,Amy,18, I don't hear it.,8,Big Bang Theory,17,4
41229,Raj,18," No, not at all.",8,Big Bang Theory,16,4
41231,Penny,18, I don't think I've eaten that much in my entire life.,8,Big Bang Theory,54,11
41232,Howard,18, It's why my people wandered the desert for 40 years. Took that long to walk it off.,8,Big Bang Theory,84,17
41233,Sheldon,18," You see, Penny, the Israelites were in the desert",8,Big Bang Theory,50,9
41234,Penny,18, Shut up.,8,Big Bang Theory,9,2
41236,Leonard,18," Right now, I'm just trying to burp without throwing up.",8,Big Bang Theory,56,10
41237,Sheldon,18, Hang on. Physics Today mentioned the paper.,8,Big Bang Theory,44,7
41239,Amy,18, Who cares? Did they mention Leonard?,8,Big Bang Theory,37,6
41240,Sheldon,18, They did.,8,Big Bang Theory,10,2
41245,Sheldon,19," Leonard, I've been working on an opening joke for our lecture at Berkeley.",8,Big Bang Theory,75,13
41246,Leonard,19," Oh, I like to laugh. But say it anyway.",8,Big Bang Theory,40,9
41247,Sheldon,19," Okay, um, what do you say to a graduate of the UC Berkeley physics department? I'll have fries with that. Because his education hasn't prepared him for a career in the sciences.",8,Big Bang Theory,178,32
41248,Penny,19," You know, when they chase you out of there, you only have to run faster than Sheldon.",8,Big Bang Theory,86,17
41249,Amy,19, Are you all set for your trip?,8,Big Bang Theory,31,7
41250,Sheldon,19," Yeah, I think so. I just restocked the old PRK.",8,Big Bang Theory,48,10
41251,Penny,19, PRK?,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
41252,Leonard,19, Public restroom kit. Everything a boy needs for making pee pee in new and strange places.,8,Big Bang Theory,90,16
41253,Sheldon,19, I don't see what's crazy about bringing a backpack with your own toilet paper and Purell.,8,Big Bang Theory,90,16
41254,Leonard,19, Keep going.,8,Big Bang Theory,12,2
41255,Sheldon,19," And rubber gloves, uh, air freshener. Um, noise-cancelling headphones. Oh, danger whistle. Um, pepper spray. Ooh, a multi-language occupied sign. Uh, let's see, we have seat protectors, uh, booties for my shoes, a clothespin for my nose. Oh, and a mirror on a stick, so I can make sure the person in the stall next to me isn't some kind of weirdo.",8,Big Bang Theory,348,62
41256,Penny,19, You still worried some Berkeley girl is gonna steal him away?,8,Big Bang Theory,62,11
41257,Amy,19," Yes, who do you think gave him the danger whistle?",8,Big Bang Theory,51,10
41259,Sheldon,19, Would you like to play a physics car game I invented called I Can't Spy? It's all the nail-biting tension of I Spy but the added fun of subatomic particles and waves outside the visible spectrum.,8,Big Bang Theory,196,36
41260,Leonard,19," If it's half as much fun as One Times Ten to the Fourth Bottles of Beer on the Wall, I'm in.",8,Big Bang Theory,93,21
41261,Sheldon,19," I'll begin. Uh, I can't spy with my little eye something passing right through us.",8,Big Bang Theory,83,15
41262,Leonard,19, That soy Frappuccino I had.,8,Big Bang Theory,28,5
41263,Sheldon,19, Will you please play the game? I can't spy with my little eye something passing right through us.,8,Big Bang Theory,98,18
41264,Leonard,19," I don't know, um, if 65 billion solar neutrinos pass through a square centimetre every second, given the surface area of this car is about 60,000 square centimetres, that means 3.9 times ten to the 15th solar neutrinos?",8,Big Bang Theory,220,38
41265,Sheldon,19, I don't want to play anymore.,8,Big Bang Theory,30,6
41266,Leonard,19, We haven't been on a road trip in a while. This is fun.,8,Big Bang Theory,56,13
41267,Sheldon,19," We get it, you won the game. Stop bragging.",8,Big Bang Theory,44,9
41268,Leonard,19," No, listen, we wrote a paper together. Now we get to go to a university and talk about it? That's pretty cool.",8,Big Bang Theory,111,22
41269,Sheldon,19," I suppose it is. In fact, if you'd like to celebrate with a little music, I'd be okay with that.",8,Big Bang Theory,97,20
41270,Leonard,19, What? This road trip just got crazy.,8,Big Bang Theory,37,7
41271,Sheldon,19," Play that funky music, white boy.",8,Big Bang Theory,34,6
41272,Leonard,19, I'm surprised you know that reference.,8,Big Bang Theory,39,6
41273,Sheldon,19, What reference?,8,Big Bang Theory,16,2
41276,Amy,19, Can I be in charge of pricing? I've been going to garage sales my whole life. Can you believe I got these pantyhose for a nickel?,8,Big Bang Theory,130,26
41277,Howard,19," All right, Amy's in charge of pricing and being 75.",8,Big Bang Theory,52,10
41278,Raj,19," Hey, Penny, can you give me a hand with this?",8,Big Bang Theory,46,10
41279,Penny,19," Sure. Oh, we had one of these growing up. I used to play all the time.",8,Big Bang Theory,71,16
41280,Raj,19," Oh, yeah? I love Ping-Pong.",8,Big Bang Theory,28,5
41281,Penny,19," Oh, I meant beer pong.",8,Big Bang Theory,23,5
41282,Amy,19," I had a table, too, but I didn't have any friends, so all I did was serve.",8,Big Bang Theory,75,17
41284,Amy,19," And if I had a friend, they might have told me that.",8,Big Bang Theory,53,12
41285,Howard,19, Excuse me. Why is there a sticker on this? It's my TARDIS from Doctor Who. I was planning on moving it in the house.,8,Big Bang Theory,117,24
41287,Howard,19," Come on, one day, this may double in value and be worth half what I paid for it.",8,Big Bang Theory,81,18
41289,Howard,19," Well, I guess as long as you're keeping an open mind.",8,Big Bang Theory,54,11
41292,Sheldon,19," So they're requesting that the white boy play the funky music, yes?",8,Big Bang Theory,68,12
41293,Leonard,19, Yes.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
41294,Sheldon,19, And this music we're listening to right now is funky as well?,8,Big Bang Theory,62,12
41295,Leonard,19, Sure.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
41296,Sheldon,19, Let me ask you this. Do you think this song is the music the white boy ultimately plays?,8,Big Bang Theory,89,18
41297,Leonard,19, It could be.,8,Big Bang Theory,13,3
41298,Sheldon,19," So it's like the musical equivalent of Russell's Paradox, the question of whether the set of all sets that don't contain themselves as members contains itself?",8,Big Bang Theory,160,26
41299,Leonard,19, Exactly.,8,Big Bang Theory,9,1
41300,Sheldon,19, Well then I hate it. Music should just be fun.,8,Big Bang Theory,47,10
41301,Leonard,19, Making great time. Gonna be there pretty early.,8,Big Bang Theory,48,8
41302,Sheldon,19, Will our hotel room be ready?,8,Big Bang Theory,30,6
41303,Leonard,19, I doubt it.,8,Big Bang Theory,12,3
41304,Sheldon,19, Aren't you worried that sitting in the lobby for a long period of time might attract the attention of the hotel detective?,8,Big Bang Theory,123,22
41305,Leonard,19," If we do, we'll just tell him to hit the bricks, see?",8,Big Bang Theory,54,12
41306,Sheldon,19," Seems a little confrontational, but all right. You know, we won't be very far from Skywalker Ranch.",8,Big Bang Theory,100,17
41307,Leonard,19," Oh, that's true. It's not like we can get in there.",8,Big Bang Theory,52,11
41308,Sheldon,19, Why not?,8,Big Bang Theory,9,2
41309,Leonard,19, I don't think George Lucas put his headquarters in the middle of nowhere because he wanted people dropping in.,8,Big Bang Theory,111,19
41310,Sheldon,19," Yoda's swamp was in the middle of nowhere. Tatooine was in the middle of nowhere. Hoth was in the middle of nowhere. That's code, Leonard. He wants us to drop in.",8,Big Bang Theory,163,31
41311,Leonard,19," We do have time. I mean, we could drive by and just look at it.",8,Big Bang Theory,64,15
41312,Sheldon,19," Yes. Oh, I'm so excited. And I just can't hide it.",8,Big Bang Theory,51,11
41313,Leonard,19," I'm about to lose control, and I think I like it.",8,Big Bang Theory,50,11
41314,Sheldon,19, What are you talking about?,8,Big Bang Theory,28,5
41316,Penny,19, So when do you guys think you're gonna move in?,8,Big Bang Theory,48,10
41317,Howard,19, We're still figuring how much remodeling we want to do.,8,Big Bang Theory,56,10
41319,Amy,19, Have you made a decision about the TARDIS? I think I can sell it if we call it Big British Porta-Potty.,8,Big Bang Theory,104,21
41320,Howard,19," We're not selling it, it's mine.",8,Big Bang Theory,33,6
41322,Howard,19, That's not fair. It's like me challenging you to a sexy pants contest.,8,Big Bang Theory,71,13
41323,Raj,19, You could play Ping-Pong for it.,8,Big Bang Theory,33,6
41324,Howard,19, I would do that.,8,Big Bang Theory,17,4
41326,Howard,19," Yes, but I mostly used it as a battlefield in an ongoing war between the Transformers and the ThunderCats for control of a bra I had found in the woods.",8,Big Bang Theory,153,30
41327,Penny,19," Bernadette, for every episode of Doctor Who Leonard has made me sit through, I will play on your behalf and send that TARDIS back to Gallifrey, where I hate that I know it belongs.",8,Big Bang Theory,181,34
41329,Howard,19," That's not fair, she has upper body muscles.",8,Big Bang Theory,45,8
41330,Raj,19," Dude, three-time Sanskriti School for Well-Born Boys badminton champion.",8,Big Bang Theory,73,9
41331,Howard,19," That's right, okay, Raj can play for me.",8,Big Bang Theory,41,8
41332,Amy,19," Ooh, you just chose champions. It's like we're re-enacting the ancient German practice of trial by combat.",8,Big Bang Theory,107,17
41333,Penny,19," Yeah, it's also like when the Mountain fought the Red Viper in Game of Thrones.",8,Big Bang Theory,80,15
41335,Penny,19," No, no, I like that show. It's got dragons and people doing it.",8,Big Bang Theory,64,13
41336,Howard,19, So it's settled. The fate of Doctor Who's TARDIS will be decided by a Game of Thrones inspired death-match on the battlefield of ThunderCats versus Transformers.,8,Big Bang Theory,162,26
41337,Amy,19," If you still have that bra, I'll give you a nickel for it.",8,Big Bang Theory,59,13
41339,Sheldon,19, There it is. It's just a gate. On a road.,8,Big Bang Theory,42,10
41340,Leonard,19, Wasn't even that hard to find.,8,Big Bang Theory,31,6
41341,Sheldon,19, This is so amazing.,8,Big Bang Theory,20,4
41342,Leonard,19, I know. You want to get a picture?,8,Big Bang Theory,35,8
41343,Sheldon,19, I want more than a picture. I want to go in.,8,Big Bang Theory,45,11
41344,Leonard,19," Well, so do I, but they'll never let us.",8,Big Bang Theory,41,9
41345,Sheldon,19, Is that the attitude that helped you get Penny?,8,Big Bang Theory,48,9
41346,Leonard,19," No, but I don't have three years to make that gate feel sorry for me.",8,Big Bang Theory,70,15
41347,Sheldon,19," There's a speaker box. Drive up, push the button, and let's see what happens.",8,Big Bang Theory,78,14
41348,Leonard,19," Okay, yeah. What do we have to lose? I'm a little nervous.",8,Big Bang Theory,59,12
41349,Sheldon,19," Well, get over it. Confidence is key in these situations.",8,Big Bang Theory,58,10
41350,Leonard,19, Right.,8,Big Bang Theory,7,1
41351,Sheldon,19," You pushed it, are you out of your mind?",8,Big Bang Theory,41,9
41353,Leonard,19," Um, uh, uh, uh, we don't have an appointment, and, and we don't belong here, but we, we're, like, crazy-big fans. I mean uh, buh, buh, crazy for Star Wars crazy, not crazy like we have a backpack full of duct tape, although we do have a backpack that you really don't want to look in.",8,Big Bang Theory,285,56
41354,Sheldon,19, You're blowing it. We want to meet George Lucas and become his friends and play with him.,8,Big Bang Theory,90,17
41356,Leonard,19, And that's how it's done.,8,Big Bang Theory,26,5
41358,Sheldon,19," All right, we've defeated the first challenge. Now we must steel ourselves to face the monster who defends the gate.",8,Big Bang Theory,117,20
41359,Leonard,19," We're trying to get past a security guard, not rescue Zelda.",8,Big Bang Theory,61,11
41360,Sheldon,19," I think what really needs to be rescued is your sense of whimsy, but one quest at a time. So what's the plan?",8,Big Bang Theory,110,23
41361,Leonard,19," Uh, I'm just gonna be honest with the guy.",8,Big Bang Theory,43,9
41362,Sheldon,19, Honesty will never get us in.,8,Big Bang Theory,30,6
41363,Leonard,19," Well, what's your plan?",8,Big Bang Theory,24,4
41364,Sheldon,19," All right, my plan is predicated on the assumption that they have a nurse's office and your willingness to be lightly stabbed.",8,Big Bang Theory,127,22
41366,Leonard,19," Uh, I'm just gonna tell you the truth.",8,Big Bang Theory,39,8
41367,Sheldon,19," Oh, you are killing me.",8,Big Bang Theory,24,5
41368,Leonard,19," We don't have an appointment. We, we're just fans of Mr. Lucas's work, and we thought we'd take a shot and see if we could get in and look around.",8,Big Bang Theory,147,30
41370,Sheldon,19, What if I told you that I was the voice of Yoda? A recording session I must attend.,8,Big Bang Theory,84,18
41371,Leonard,19," I'm sorry, don't listen to him. We're actually physicists. We're giving a lecture at Berkeley later today. We just, we had some time to kill.",8,Big Bang Theory,142,25
41373,Leonard,19, Thank you so much. See? Maybe honesty is the best What are you doing?,8,Big Bang Theory,70,14
41374,Sheldon,19," Shedding the yoke of my oppressors, you blind, sad little man.",8,Big Bang Theory,63,11
41377,Sheldon,19," I can see the ranch, Leonard. Oh, it's rustic, it's lovely. I'd take a picture, but people are chasing me. I'm gonna make it. I'm gonna make it. They have Tasers, but they wouldn't dare use Aaaaaaagh!",8,Big Bang Theory,201,37
41379,Howard,19," Come on, Raj. You are the King Kong of Ping-Pong. You are the menace of table tennis. Put her away, 'cause I don't have a third one. Yes. Woo.",8,Big Bang Theory,143,29
41380,Amy,19," Rajesh eight, Penny four.",8,Big Bang Theory,26,4
41381,Penny,19," Sorry, he's really good.",8,Big Bang Theory,25,4
41383,Raj,19, What?,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
41384,Howard,19," Yeah, what?",8,Big Bang Theory,12,2
41386,Howard,19," Don't listen to her. You and I go way back, we're like brothers.",8,Big Bang Theory,65,13
41387,Raj,19," We are. We are. Oh, no. What a terrible serve. Sorry, brother.",8,Big Bang Theory,63,12
41388,Amy,19, Eight-five.,8,Big Bang Theory,12,1
41389,Howard,19," This is ridiculous. I want a new champion. Amy, were you serious about being able to serve?",8,Big Bang Theory,92,17
41390,Amy,19," Uh, it, it's been a long time. I don't know. I'm probably pretty rusty.",8,Big Bang Theory,72,14
41391,Penny,19, Wow.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
41392,Howard,19, She's my champion.,8,Big Bang Theory,19,3
41394,Penny,19, Hey.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
41396,Penny,19," I care. Oh, wait, no, I don't. Good luck, Raj.",8,Big Bang Theory,47,10
41397,Howard,19," You know, I thought our friendship meant more to you.",8,Big Bang Theory,54,10
41398,Raj,19, So did I.,8,Big Bang Theory,10,3
41400,Sheldon,19, Do you think they're gonna call the police?,8,Big Bang Theory,44,8
41401,Leonard,19, I don't know. Maybe they'll call Imperial Officers to take us to a holding cell on the Death Star.,8,Big Bang Theory,99,19
41402,Sheldon,19," Oh, I think that's below the pay grade of an Imperial Officer. Stormtroopers are really the ones who",8,Big Bang Theory,101,18
41403,Leonard,19," Oh, shut up.",8,Big Bang Theory,13,3
41405,Leonard,19," Uh-huh, I'm normally very nice, but you shut up, too.",8,Big Bang Theory,54,10
41406,Sheldon,19," So, what are you in for?",8,Big Bang Theory,25,6
41408,Sheldon,19, But why are you here?,8,Big Bang Theory,22,5
41410,Sheldon,19," Excuse me. Leonard, they have a sculpture gallery.",8,Big Bang Theory,51,8
41412,Leonard,19, We understand. Thank you so much.,8,Big Bang Theory,34,6
41415,Sheldon,19," Uh, one question about that picture. Can it be with George Lucas? Ooh, grumpy you are.",8,Big Bang Theory,87,16
41417,Howard,19," Okay, this is the match that decides it all. First to 11 wins. Serve switches every five points. And just so you know, when this started, I was going to put the TARDIS in a discreet corner of the house, but I've since turned mean, and now it's going right in the middle of the living room on a rotating platform with a sign that says suck it. Game on.",8,Big Bang Theory,352,70
41419,Raj,19," Uh, yeah, I mean, her serve was pretty good.",8,Big Bang Theory,45,9
41421,Raj,19," Okay, uh, I'm gonna own you, bitch.",8,Big Bang Theory,36,7
41422,Penny,19, Whoa.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
41424,Amy,19, That's not nice.,8,Big Bang Theory,17,3
41425,Raj,19, Let's just play.,8,Big Bang Theory,17,3
41426,Howard,19," One-zero. Two. Three. Four. Five-nothing. Wait, did you play badminton or sad-minton?",8,Big Bang Theory,86,12
41428,Raj,19," What, and that's not offensive? Where's the line?",8,Big Bang Theory,50,8
41429,Penny,19, It's in your purse. Play.,8,Big Bang Theory,26,5
41431,Howard,19, Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten-five.,8,Big Bang Theory,35,5
41433,Amy,19," Well, that was an exciting 40 seconds.",8,Big Bang Theory,39,7
41434,Howard,19," It was, and now the serve is back to you, and the game is over.",8,Big Bang Theory,64,15
41436,Howard,19," Don't listen to her, just hit the ball.",8,Big Bang Theory,40,8
41437,Amy,19, Keep talking.,8,Big Bang Theory,14,2
41441,Sheldon,19, Are you still mad at me?,8,Big Bang Theory,25,6
41442,Leonard,19," Yes, we missed our lecture, we were almost arrested, and you got me locked in a room with a man who forced his tongue down the throat of a stuffed Wookiee.",8,Big Bang Theory,156,31
41443,Sheldon,19," Boy, some people are just glass-half-empty.",8,Big Bang Theory,44,6
41444,Leonard,19," The glass is empty, Sheldon. It's completely empty. If you gave that glass to a man who was dying of thirst, he would be dead, do you know why?",8,Big Bang Theory,144,29
41445,Sheldon,19," Before I answer, was he a smoker? I think you're looking at this all wrong.",8,Big Bang Theory,76,15
41446,Leonard,19," Fine, then tell me how I should be looking at it.",8,Big Bang Theory,50,11
41447,Sheldon,19," Well, not only did we go to Skywalker Ranch, we got in. And no one we know can say that. And for all the times you find me irritating, today you got to watch someone shoot me with a Taser.",8,Big Bang Theory,189,40
41448,Leonard,19, That part was pretty good.,8,Big Bang Theory,27,5
41449,Sheldon,19, See?,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
41450,Leonard,19, You did flop around a lot.,8,Big Bang Theory,27,6
41451,Sheldon,19, I'll take your word for it. I was too busy trying not to defecate.,8,Big Bang Theory,67,14
41452,Leonard,19," You know, when they were escorting us to the detaining room, I looked through a door, and I'm pretty sure I saw a display case with the Ark of the Covenant.",8,Big Bang Theory,157,31
41453,Sheldon,19, That's amazing.,8,Big Bang Theory,16,2
41454,Leonard,19, I know.,8,Big Bang Theory,8,2
41455,Sheldon,19," And I saw Jabba the Hutt riding by on a motorcycle. Although that was right after the Tasing, so who can say for sure?",8,Big Bang Theory,119,24
41456,Leonard,19, I guess this could count as an adventure.,8,Big Bang Theory,42,8
41457,Sheldon,19," It was. And even though we're not allowed back there, they can never take today away from us. Unlike my sense of smell, which hasn't returned since the Tasing. No, I got nothing.",8,Big Bang Theory,179,33
41459,Sheldon,19," Amy, the Daleks are right on my tail, quick, we need to reset the time circuits. Oh, no, I left my sonic screwdriver behind.",8,Big Bang Theory,125,24
41460,Amy,19, Really should have thought this through.,8,Big Bang Theory,41,6
41462,Raj,20, You're wrong.,8,Big Bang Theory,14,2
41463,Howard,20," No, I'm not.",8,Big Bang Theory,13,3
41464,Raj,20," Yes, you are.",8,Big Bang Theory,14,3
41465,Howard,20," No, I'm not. Settle this. Those little animated pictures on the Internet, are they called gifs or jifs?",8,Big Bang Theory,104,18
41466,Leonard,20," Well, the G stands for graphics. That's a hard G, so I'd say gif.",8,Big Bang Theory,66,14
41467,Raj,20, The guy who invented it says it's jif.,8,Big Bang Theory,39,8
41468,Howard,20," I'm sorry, do you mean the guy or the juy?",8,Big Bang Theory,43,10
41469,Sheldon,20," Well, I'll give you three guesses why I'm so irritated.",8,Big Bang Theory,56,10
41470,Howard,20, Something happened different from the way you wanted it.,8,Big Bang Theory,57,9
41471,Sheldon,20," I guess news travels fast. It's true, a select group of scientists was invited to a weekend symposium at a former home of Richard Feynman, and I wasn't included.",8,Big Bang Theory,162,29
41472,Leonard,20," Oh, Sheldon, I'm sure it's not because they don't think you're an elite scientist.",8,Big Bang Theory,83,14
41473,Howard,20," Yeah, I bet you anything it's just 'cause you're a pain in the ass.",8,Big Bang Theory,68,14
41474,Sheldon,20, You're just saying that to make me feel better.,8,Big Bang Theory,48,9
41475,Leonard,20," Look, you can spend the rest of the day being bitter about this.",8,Big Bang Theory,65,13
41476,Sheldon,20, Agreed.,8,Big Bang Theory,8,1
41477,Leonard,20," I was gonna say or, but why bother?",8,Big Bang Theory,36,8
41480,Raj,20," Hey, I got you a little gift.",8,Big Bang Theory,30,7
41482,Raj,20," You know me. I'm from India. I can't resist children begging. So, how's it going with the title to the house?",8,Big Bang Theory,110,21
41483,Howard,20," Great, it's all done. The lawyer tracked down my father and got him to sign it over. I didn't have to meet him, I didn't have to talk to him, I don't even know where he is.",8,Big Bang Theory,173,37
41484,Raj,20," Wow, so you're not curious at all?",8,Big Bang Theory,35,7
41485,Howard,20, Nope.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
41486,Raj,20," Hmm. What if he's in prison? What if he's a spy? What if he's in a Beatles cover band? I'm just saying, if he's got your nose and haircut, he'd make a killer Ringo.",8,Big Bang Theory,165,34
41489,Penny,20," Oh, it's cool, I've never been on a podcast before.",8,Big Bang Theory,52,10
41490,Leonard,20," Well, you picked a good one to start. Wil's had lots of great guests. Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner, Michael Dorn, Gates McFadden.",8,Big Bang Theory,131,22
41491,Penny,20, Those are Star Trek people.,8,Big Bang Theory,28,5
41492,Leonard,20, Yes.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
41493,Penny,20, I only figured that out because I've never heard of any of them.,8,Big Bang Theory,65,13
41495,Penny,20, Sorry.,8,Big Bang Theory,7,1
41497,Leonard,20, This is exciting.,8,Big Bang Theory,18,3
41498,Penny,20," Yeah, so, how many people listen?",8,Big Bang Theory,34,6
41500,Penny,20, What? A few thousand people listen to you talk about nerd stuff?,8,Big Bang Theory,65,12
41503,Amy,20, Can you please pass the salt?,8,Big Bang Theory,30,6
41504,Sheldon,20, Sure. It's not like I was invited to Richard Feynman's house and have anything better to do.,8,Big Bang Theory,93,17
41505,Amy,20, Is this how the rest of the night's going to be?,8,Big Bang Theory,49,11
41506,Sheldon,20," I don't know the future. Do you think there's a chance that an asteroid could hit the Earth, destroying Feynman's house and everyone in it?",8,Big Bang Theory,140,25
41507,Amy,20," No, Sheldon.",8,Big Bang Theory,13,2
41508,Sheldon,20," Then buckle up, you're in for a cranky night.",8,Big Bang Theory,46,9
41509,Amy,20," According to the codicil of the Relationship Agreement which you insisted upon, we're not allowed to pout or be moody on date night.",8,Big Bang Theory,133,23
41510,Sheldon,20, You know I just put that in because of uterus stuff.,8,Big Bang Theory,53,11
41511,Amy,20," Well, it applies to you, too.",8,Big Bang Theory,30,6
41512,Sheldon,20," I was afraid you might bring this up, so I have a work-around. There you go. As far as you're concerned, I'm smiling. Although, I must admit, I'm smiling a little bit at the moment because this loophole is so brilliant.",8,Big Bang Theory,220,41
41514,Raj,20," So, Bernadette, have you thought about how you're going to redecorate this place?",8,Big Bang Theory,82,13
41516,Raj,20," You know, if you knocked out this wall, it would give you an open floor plan, and then, it's a little scary, but could be fun, indoor fire pit.",8,Big Bang Theory,144,29
41517,Howard,20," Hey, I grew up in this house, okay? No one's knocking anything down.",8,Big Bang Theory,69,13
41519,Howard,20, Can I help you?,8,Big Bang Theory,16,4
41521,Howard,20, Yes.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
41523,Howard,20," Wuh, uh, who's your father?",8,Big Bang Theory,28,5
41525,Howard,20, Sam Wolowitz is my father.,8,Big Bang Theory,27,5
41527,Howard,20," Well, wait, so if we have the same father, are, are you saying you're my half-brother?",8,Big Bang Theory,87,16
41529,Howard,20," Bernadette, weird things are happening out here.",8,Big Bang Theory,49,7
41532,Leonard,20, Psst.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
41534,Leonard,20," I, I didn't want to interrupt.",8,Big Bang Theory,31,6
41536,Leonard,20, Really?,8,Big Bang Theory,8,1
41538,Leonard,20," Hey, great.",8,Big Bang Theory,12,2
41541,Penny,20," Okay, well, I'll apologize for the first time, but the other nine are on you.",8,Big Bang Theory,78,15
41543,Penny,20, Really?,8,Big Bang Theory,8,1
41545,Leonard,20," Oh, if she was with an Indian guy dressed like a banana, that was just my friends, Howard and Raj.",8,Big Bang Theory,99,20
41548,Penny,20," Hey, Kevin. It's really exciting to talk to you.",8,Big Bang Theory,49,9
41549,Leonard,20, It really is.,8,Big Bang Theory,14,3
41551,Penny,20," Oh, wow. I wish it was better.",8,Big Bang Theory,31,7
41554,Penny,20, Aw.,8,Big Bang Theory,4,1
41557,Penny,20, Seriously?,8,Big Bang Theory,11,1
41559,Penny,20," Oh, my, I would love that.",8,Big Bang Theory,27,6
41560,Leonard,20, You have a new job.,8,Big Bang Theory,20,5
41561,Penny,20," Well, maybe I can do both.",8,Big Bang Theory,27,6
41562,Leonard,20, I don't think you can do both.,8,Big Bang Theory,31,7
41563,Penny,20, I don't think I asked you.,8,Big Bang Theory,27,6
41565,Leonard,20," Stay out of it, Kevin Smith.",8,Big Bang Theory,29,6
41567,Sheldon,20, Do you think there comes a point in life when it stops feeling bad to be left out of things?,8,Big Bang Theory,93,20
41568,Amy,20, Probably not. It's an evolutionary advantage to be included in group activities.,8,Big Bang Theory,81,12
41569,Sheldon,20," You know what? I used to be a fan of evolution, but I've since evolved, and now I think it's dumb.",8,Big Bang Theory,99,21
41570,Amy,20, Being left out is a terrible feeling. No one understands that better than I do.,8,Big Bang Theory,80,15
41571,Sheldon,20," Hey, look at that. Even in your example, you're all by yourself.",8,Big Bang Theory,65,12
41572,Amy,20," When there was a lice epidemic at my school, everybody got it except me. I tried to fool everyone by sprinkling sugar in my hair, but I just got attacked by bees.",8,Big Bang Theory,163,32
41573,Sheldon,20," I can just picture them all right now at Feynman's house, probably discussing Schrodinger and at the same time, not discussing Schrodinger. See? They're missing out on hilarious jokes like that.",8,Big Bang Theory,195,31
41574,Amy,20," And at the same time, not.",8,Big Bang Theory,27,6
41575,Sheldon,20, It reminds me of when my stupid brother and sister would build forts in the living room and wouldn't let me in. I hated that so much.,8,Big Bang Theory,134,27
41576,Amy,20," You know, there's nothing I can do about getting you invited to the symposium, but if you wanted, we could build a fort.",8,Big Bang Theory,121,23
41577,Sheldon,20, Isn't that a little juvenile?,8,Big Bang Theory,30,5
41578,Amy,20, More juvenile than this?,8,Big Bang Theory,25,4
41579,Sheldon,20, I'll get the blankets. You Google how to have childlike fun.,8,Big Bang Theory,61,11
41581,Howard,20," You know what, I'm being a bad host. Let me get some more coffee.",8,Big Bang Theory,66,14
41583,Howard,20," No, I got it.",8,Big Bang Theory,14,4
41587,Raj,20, Enough chitchat. How do we know you are who you say you are?,8,Big Bang Theory,61,13
41589,Raj,20," Okay, you got me there. You here looking for money?",8,Big Bang Theory,52,10
41591,Raj,20," A kidney, cornea, piece of his liver?",8,Big Bang Theory,38,7
41593,Raj,20, You're in a Beatles cover band and you need Howard to replace your dad as Ringo.,8,Big Bang Theory,81,16
41595,Raj,20," Okay, but something smells fishy. And not just because you work around sea animals. That actually sounds interesting, and I'd like to learn more about it. Hey, you okay?",8,Big Bang Theory,170,29
41596,Howard,20," Not really. This guy shows up out of the blue, and now I have a brother? My father has another family?",8,Big Bang Theory,103,21
41597,Raj,20, I get it. What do you want to do?,8,Big Bang Theory,34,9
41598,Howard,20," I don't know. I, I'd just like him to go away. I can't deal with this.",8,Big Bang Theory,71,16
41599,Raj,20," All right, I've got your back.",8,Big Bang Theory,31,6
41600,Howard,20," Thank you. Come on. And I'd like to point out, this wall just provided a lot of privacy.",8,Big Bang Theory,89,18
41602,Raj,20," Listen, dude, it's time for you to hit the road.",8,Big Bang Theory,49,10
41603,Howard,20," Hey, hey, the young man asked a good question.",8,Big Bang Theory,47,9
41606,Leonard,20," No, no, no. We're not fighting, we're just having a conversation.",8,Big Bang Theory,66,11
41608,Leonard,20, Give me back that juice.,8,Big Bang Theory,25,5
41609,Penny,20, What is the harm if I audition?,8,Big Bang Theory,32,7
41610,Leonard,20," Well, what if you get it?",8,Big Bang Theory,26,6
41611,Penny,20," I don't know, I make a movie, become rich and famous, win an Oscar, a Golden Globe and live an incredibly wonderful life.",8,Big Bang Theory,122,23
41612,Leonard,20, From a Kevin Smith movie?,8,Big Bang Theory,26,5
41617,Penny,20, Thanks a lot.,8,Big Bang Theory,14,3
41618,Leonard,20, I'm just trying to protect you. How many times did I see you get your heart broken trying to make it as an actress?,8,Big Bang Theory,116,24
41619,Penny,20," Okay, instead of protecting me, why don't you try being excited when something good happens?",8,Big Bang Theory,93,15
41620,Leonard,20, I'm always excited for you. I'm excited that you found this new job where you're making decent money.,8,Big Bang Theory,102,18
41621,Penny,20, Decent? I make twice what you make.,8,Big Bang Theory,36,7
41622,Leonard,20," Wait, twice?",8,Big Bang Theory,13,2
41623,Penny,20, Yeah.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
41624,Leonard,20," Like, times two twice?",8,Big Bang Theory,23,4
41626,Leonard,20, I went to school for half my life. I have a doctorate. I'm still paying off college loans.,8,Big Bang Theory,91,18
41627,Penny,20," Well, how much do you owe? Maybe I can help you out.",8,Big Bang Theory,53,12
41628,Leonard,20," Wil, can we just turn off the podcast for a little bit?",8,Big Bang Theory,56,12
41631,Amy,20," How's it going, Sheldon?",8,Big Bang Theory,25,4
41632,Sheldon,20, Wonderful. I just finished hanging the lights.,8,Big Bang Theory,47,7
41633,Amy,20, Can I come in?,8,Big Bang Theory,15,4
41634,Sheldon,20," Yes, oh, but enter through the side. Batman is a load-bearing blanket.",8,Big Bang Theory,71,12
41635,Amy,20, Amazing.,8,Big Bang Theory,9,1
41636,Sheldon,20, I know. This isn't the printout. This is my real face.,8,Big Bang Theory,55,11
41637,Amy,20, What are we doing? This is a fort. Let's sit on the floor.,8,Big Bang Theory,59,13
41638,Sheldon,20, Roughing it? Okay. Everything looks so big from down here. This must be how Leonard feels.,8,Big Bang Theory,91,16
41640,Howard,20," I'm surprised you could hear me with this Thin Mint in your ear. Yeah, pretty cool, huh?",8,Big Bang Theory,89,17
41644,Howard,20," Well, I hope I get to see you again.",8,Big Bang Theory,37,9
41647,Howard,20," Hey, I threw out the first pitch at an Angels game.",8,Big Bang Theory,52,11
41651,Howard,20, That's not what she meant.,8,Big Bang Theory,27,5
41652,Raj,20," But technically, yes.",8,Big Bang Theory,22,3
41654,Leonard,20," Hang on, if you're making all this money, where is it?",8,Big Bang Theory,55,11
41655,Penny,20, In a safe place.,8,Big Bang Theory,17,4
41656,Leonard,20," What does that mean, under your bed?",8,Big Bang Theory,37,7
41657,Penny,20," No, it means a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds. I'm not overly conservative. I'm young, so my guy said I can afford to take some risks.",8,Big Bang Theory,146,27
41658,Leonard,20," Wait a minute, you have a guy?",8,Big Bang Theory,31,7
41659,Penny,20, Don't you have a guy?,8,Big Bang Theory,22,5
41660,Leonard,20, Why would I have a guy? I don't have any money.,8,Big Bang Theory,48,11
41661,Penny,20," Oh, sweetie, you should really get some money.",8,Big Bang Theory,47,8
41663,Leonard,20," Wil, I'm begging you, just please turn that off.",8,Big Bang Theory,49,9
41665,Penny,20," Leonard, why are you making such a big deal out of this? So our roles have changed a bit over the last couple years. This is the way life is. And I'm sure in time they'll change again.",8,Big Bang Theory,185,38
41666,Leonard,20," Great, you're not only more successful than me, now you're more mature.",8,Big Bang Theory,72,12
41667,Penny,20," Okay, look, would it make you feel better if I did something dumb like sneak out of work one day to go audition for a Kevin Smith movie?",8,Big Bang Theory,137,28
41668,Leonard,20," That would be great, thank you.",8,Big Bang Theory,32,6
41670,Leonard,20," Yes, it is, Wil.",8,Big Bang Theory,17,4
41673,Howard,20, It was actually just a mechanical hand.,8,Big Bang Theory,40,7
41675,Howard,20, You are my brother.,8,Big Bang Theory,20,4
41677,Sheldon,20," Okay, so the final four forts in the first annual best fort ever contest, or fort off, are, Fort Knox, Fort Ticonderoga, Fort Sumter and Fort Cozy McBlanket.",8,Big Bang Theory,158,28
41678,Amy,20," I'd say, Knox over Ticonderoga, 'cause it's got the gold.",8,Big Bang Theory,58,10
41679,Sheldon,20, Mm-hmm.,8,Big Bang Theory,8,1
41680,Amy,20, And McBlanket over Sumter 'cause it has a higher thread count. Oh. Ten o'clock. Date night's over.,8,Big Bang Theory,99,17
41681,Sheldon,20," Wait, no. We haven't picked a winner.",8,Big Bang Theory,38,7
41682,Amy,20, We both know this one's gonna win.,8,Big Bang Theory,35,7
41683,Sheldon,20," Well, of course we do. Fort Knox doesn't have a secret physics lending library.",8,Big Bang Theory,80,14
41684,Amy,20," Come on, I'll help you take this down.",8,Big Bang Theory,39,8
41685,Sheldon,20," Well, wait. What if, just this once, we suspend the date night parameters and you stay later?",8,Big Bang Theory,94,17
41686,Amy,20," Well, as long as we're suspending the parameters, I could stay really late and we could have our first sleepover.",8,Big Bang Theory,114,20
41687,Sheldon,20, That's a big step.,8,Big Bang Theory,19,4
41688,Amy,20, It's a big fort.,8,Big Bang Theory,17,4
41689,Sheldon,20," Very well. I will agree to a family-friendly, G-rated, boy-girl sleepover.",8,Big Bang Theory,75,11
41690,Amy,20, PG. Some scenes may be too intense for younger viewers.,8,Big Bang Theory,56,10
41691,Sheldon,20," G-rated, with a warning for families with babies and toddlers.",8,Big Bang Theory,63,10
41692,Amy,20, You got yourself a sleepover.,8,Big Bang Theory,30,5
41693,Sheldon,20, Do you need to borrow a toothbrush or pajamas?,8,Big Bang Theory,47,9
41694,Amy,20, Would it alarm you to know that I hid those things here two years ago just in case this ever came up?,8,Big Bang Theory,102,22
41695,Sheldon,20," It would, but you know how much I admire preparedness. How did you know we'd be in the living room?",8,Big Bang Theory,100,20
41696,Amy,20, Who says this is the only one I hid?,8,Big Bang Theory,37,9
41698,Leonard,20, Hello? What is this?,8,Big Bang Theory,21,4
41699,Sheldon,20, We built a fort.,8,Big Bang Theory,17,4
41700,Leonard,20, Are those my sheets?,8,Big Bang Theory,21,4
41701,Amy,20," Yes, they are.",8,Big Bang Theory,15,3
41702,Leonard,20," Okay. Well, you kids have fun. I'm gonna go to sleep.",8,Big Bang Theory,54,11
41703,Sheldon,20," Well, Leonard, don't you want to see the inside of the fort?",8,Big Bang Theory,61,12
41704,Leonard,20," Yeah, I'm good.",8,Big Bang Theory,16,3
41705,Sheldon,20," Oh, come on. I really wanted to tell someone they can't come in.",8,Big Bang Theory,65,13
41706,Leonard,20," Okay, fine. Sheldon, may I please visit your fort?",8,Big Bang Theory,51,9
41707,Sheldon,20," I want to say no, but it's too glorious. Get in here.",8,Big Bang Theory,54,12
41708,Leonard,20, Thank you.,8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
41709,Amy,20," Okay, have a seat on the floor.",8,Big Bang Theory,32,7
41710,Sheldon,20, Not there. That's my spot.,8,Big Bang Theory,27,5
41712,Sheldon,21," Hey, would you like to hear some songs I've rewritten to get children interested in the hard sciences?",8,Big Bang Theory,103,18
41713,Howard,21, Sure.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
41714,Leonard,21, Really?,8,Big Bang Theory,8,1
41715,Howard,21," Yeah. Well, I like music, I like science, I like making fun of Sheldon. Hit it.",8,Big Bang Theory,80,16
41716,Sheldon,21," There was a scientist who had a theory and James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o. J-A-M-E-S, C-L-E-R-K space M-A-X-W-E-L-L, And James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o. There was a scientist who had a theory and James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o, A-M-E-S",8,Big Bang Theory,248,42
41717,Leonard,21," Uh, okay, okay. Uh, we, we get it.",8,Big Bang Theory,35,8
41718,Sheldon,21," Perhaps you'd prefer this one. The itsy bitsy spider is not an insect at all, because it haseight legs and two body parts.",8,Big Bang Theory,123,23
41719,Leonard,21," That's pretty cool, Sheldon.",8,Big Bang Theory,29,4
41720,Sheldon,21, Thank you. Do either of you know BeyoncÃ©? I'd love her to get behind it.,8,Big Bang Theory,74,15
41721,Raj,21, Hey.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
41722,Leonard,21, Hey.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
41723,Howard,21, Hey.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
41724,Sheldon,21, Hello.,8,Big Bang Theory,7,1
41725,Raj,21, You guys know the new Discovery class missions that NASA's been working on?,8,Big Bang Theory,76,13
41726,Leonard,21, Yeah.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
41727,Raj,21," Well, they're looking to include a message from Earth in case one of them is encountered by alien life.",8,Big Bang Theory,104,19
41728,Leonard,21," Oh. When I encountered alien life, I discovered that the key thing was not to sit in its spot.",8,Big Bang Theory,95,19
41729,Sheldon,21," All right, you can't breathe our air without an inhaler, he's allergic to Earth nuts, but I'm the alien.",8,Big Bang Theory,105,19
41730,Raj,21," Anyway, I'm among a handful of scientists that have been asked to submit a design proposal for the message and its delivery system.",8,Big Bang Theory,132,23
41731,Sheldon,21, Excellent.,8,Big Bang Theory,11,1
41732,Howard,21, Good for you.,8,Big Bang Theory,14,3
41733,Leonard,21, Congratulations.,8,Big Bang Theory,17,1
41734,Raj,21, And I was wondering if any of you guys would like to help me do it.,8,Big Bang Theory,68,16
41735,Leonard,21, Are you kidding? Yes. What did you have in mind?,8,Big Bang Theory,49,10
41736,Sheldon,21," I'll tell you exactly what you should do, avoid the presumption of the Terran sensory input paradigm.",8,Big Bang Theory,102,17
41737,Howard,21," Yeah, absolutely. You need a device capable of delivering information across a wide range of perceptual modalities.",8,Big Bang Theory,116,17
41738,Sheldon,21, Any intelligent organism would at the very least need the ability to locate the position of objects in space. So the ideal interstellar lingua franca would be haptic.,8,Big Bang Theory,167,28
41739,Howard,21," Ooh, how about a 3-D tactile communicator rigged for cross-sensory transposition?",8,Big Bang Theory,82,11
41740,Raj,21," Exactly what I expected. Two people forcing their ideas on me and only one gentleman who could be bothered to ask me what my thoughts were. You two are out. Congratulations, Leonard, you're on the team.",8,Big Bang Theory,203,36
41741,Leonard,21, My mommy raised a gentleman.,8,Big Bang Theory,29,5
41743,Raj,21, Hey. Thanks for coming by.,8,Big Bang Theory,27,5
41744,Leonard,21, Yeah. I'm excited to help.,8,Big Bang Theory,27,5
41745,Raj,21," I would have included the others, but you know exactly what would've happened. They would've taken over the project and bossed us around.",8,Big Bang Theory,138,23
41746,Leonard,21," I get it. Uh, just this morning, Sheldon wouldn't let me put almond milk on my Grape-Nuts because he said it was a theoretical nut conflict.",8,Big Bang Theory,141,26
41747,Raj,21, You should have told him to mind his own business.,8,Big Bang Theory,51,10
41748,Leonard,21," Yeah. That's better than what I did say, which was, fine, I'll eat them with club soda.",8,Big Bang Theory,88,17
41749,Raj,21, What makes them think they're always in charge of everything?,8,Big Bang Theory,62,10
41750,Leonard,21," Mmm, they're alpha males.",8,Big Bang Theory,26,4
41751,Raj,21," Huh, what does that make us?",8,Big Bang Theory,29,6
41752,Leonard,21, We could be betas. They're second in charge.,8,Big Bang Theory,45,8
41753,Raj,21," Okay, that sounds good.",8,Big Bang Theory,24,4
41754,Leonard,21, Or we could be omegas. They get pushed around by the alphas and the betas.,8,Big Bang Theory,75,15
41755,Raj,21," Okay, that sounds like us.",8,Big Bang Theory,27,5
41756,Leonard,21," Whatever. There's no alphas here, and this is your project. You're in charge. How do you want to start?",8,Big Bang Theory,104,19
41757,Raj,21, I don't know. How do you want to start?,8,Big Bang Theory,40,9
41758,Leonard,21, I don't know. Should we call Sheldon and Howard?,8,Big Bang Theory,49,9
41759,Raj,21, No. We can do this by ourselves.,8,Big Bang Theory,33,7
41760,Leonard,21, Okay. Great. How do you want to start?,8,Big Bang Theory,39,8
41761,Raj,21, I don't know. How do you want to start?,8,Big Bang Theory,40,9
41763,Penny,21,  Sheldon.  Sheldon.  Sheldon.,8,Big Bang Theory,30,3
41764,Sheldon,21," I bet that started off as a joke, but by the third one you realized there was something strangely enjoyable about it.",8,Big Bang Theory,118,22
41765,Penny,21," Yeah, I kind of want to do it again.",8,Big Bang Theory,37,9
41766,Sheldon,21," I don't recommend it. You'll be doing it the rest of your life. Anyway, if you're looking for Leonard, he's with Koothrappali.",8,Big Bang Theory,127,22
41767,Penny,21," Uh, no, I actually came to talk to you.",8,Big Bang Theory,40,9
41768,Sheldon,21," How nice. Here are some topics that interest me, quantum mechanics, trains, flags.",8,Big Bang Theory,83,13
41769,Penny,21," No, no. It's about my acting career.",8,Big Bang Theory,37,7
41770,Sheldon,21," Oh, sorry. That's not on the list.",8,Big Bang Theory,35,7
41771,Penny,21, Well.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
41772,Sheldon,21," Oh, wait. No. How about we split the difference and discuss why Austria was an archduchy and not just a regular duchy.",8,Big Bang Theory,119,22
41773,Penny,21," Okay, look, here's the thing. I like pharmaceutical sales, it's going great, but I have an audition for a movie, and if I get it, it could screw everything up.",8,Big Bang Theory,160,30
41774,Sheldon,21," Hmm. I know exactly what you should do. Unfortunately, I cannot tell you.",8,Big Bang Theory,74,13
41775,Penny,21," Well, why?",8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
41776,Sheldon,21," I'm attempting to turn over a new leaf. Earlier today, it was pointed out to me that I tend to force my ideas on people.",8,Big Bang Theory,121,25
41777,Penny,21, You're really not gonna tell me?,8,Big Bang Theory,33,6
41778,Sheldon,21," No, that train has left the station. Now, we can play this one of two ways. You can say, trains, tell me more, or you can just look at me like that and I'll start.",8,Big Bang Theory,164,35
41781,Howard,21, I am making molecular cocktails. This sphere is actually a cosmopolitan.,8,Big Bang Theory,73,11
41783,Howard,21," Oh, just put it in your mouth and pop it like a zit.",8,Big Bang Theory,53,13
41785,Howard,21, First take a picture with me.,8,Big Bang Theory,30,6
41787,Howard,21," Well, Raj and I always talked about learning how to make cocktails like this together, so I taught myself and I'm putting this on Instagram so he can see it and feel like a turd. Say cheese.",8,Big Bang Theory,191,37
41789,Howard,21, You betcha. The very one.,8,Big Bang Theory,26,5
41791,Howard,21, I know. That's why I'm spending tonight with you.,8,Big Bang Theory,50,9
41793,Howard,21, With my honeybunch.,8,Big Bang Theory,20,3
41795,Howard,21, No. He is. So I have a dominant personality. We all know that.,8,Big Bang Theory,63,13
41797,Howard,21," In social groupings, I just naturally wind up in charge.",8,Big Bang Theory,57,10
41799,Howard,21, You don't think I'm a leader?,8,Big Bang Theory,30,6
41801,Howard,21, Right. I couldn't change if I wanted to.,8,Big Bang Theory,41,8
41803,Howard,21, All by myself.,8,Big Bang Theory,15,3
41806,Sheldon,21," So, often on the front of the locomotive is a large iron wedge for clearing objects off the tracks. Now, while commonly known as a cowcatcher, I prefer the more accurate cow exploder.",8,Big Bang Theory,184,33
41807,Penny,21," Okay. Sheldon, let me ask you a question.",8,Big Bang Theory,42,8
41808,Sheldon,21, Mmm.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
41809,Penny,21," If I was at a train station and one train could take me to my current job and the other train could take me to an audition for a movie, which train should I get on?",8,Big Bang Theory,165,36
41810,Sheldon,21, Are you using trains to trick me into giving you advice?,8,Big Bang Theory,57,11
41811,Penny,21, No.,8,Big Bang Theory,4,1
41812,Sheldon,21," All right, then. You should take a third train where you audition for the movie but hold off on making a career decision until you have more information.",8,Big Bang Theory,154,28
41813,Penny,21, Oh. You're right. I'm worried about something that hasn't even happened yet. Huh. You are a wise man.,8,Big Bang Theory,102,18
41814,Sheldon,21," Well, Penny, who's smarter, the wise man or the person who comes to him for advice?",8,Big Bang Theory,84,16
41815,Penny,21," Oh, I guess you're right. Maybe it is the person who asks.",8,Big Bang Theory,59,12
41816,Sheldon,21," No, it's the wise man. That's why he's called the wise man. You know how I know that? I'm the wise man.",8,Big Bang Theory,104,22
41817,Penny,21, I'm sorry. What was I thinking?,8,Big Bang Theory,32,6
41818,Sheldon,21," Uh, just out of curiosity, why didn't you ask Leonard for advice about this?",8,Big Bang Theory,77,14
41819,Penny,21," â€˜Cause I already know what he'll say. Wah, wah, wah, you shouldn't do it.",8,Big Bang Theory,76,14
41820,Sheldon,21," Ah, it's just like he's here.",8,Big Bang Theory,30,6
41822,Raj,21," Okay, so we know that previous attempts to send a message into space, like the Golden Record on Voyager, were heavily criticized.",8,Big Bang Theory,130,22
41823,Leonard,21," Well, aliens could only play the Golden Record if they figured out how to build a record player.",8,Big Bang Theory,97,18
41824,Raj,21," Eh. Although, to be fair, I watched E.T. build a telephone out of a Speak & Spell and an umbrella. Dude was like a little brown MacGyver.",8,Big Bang Theory,138,27
41825,Leonard,21, That would be more helpful if E.T. were real.,8,Big Bang Theory,46,9
41826,Raj,21," Well, my feelings were real when he was about to die.",8,Big Bang Theory,54,11
41827,Leonard,21," My God, when he's on the table and they use the paddles on him.",8,Big Bang Theory,64,14
41828,Raj,21, And he's all white.,8,Big Bang Theory,20,4
41829,Leonard,21, They zip him up in that bag.,8,Big Bang Theory,29,7
41830,Raj,21, And Gertie can't stop crying.,8,Big Bang Theory,30,5
41831,Leonard,21, The flower dies.,8,Big Bang Theory,17,3
41832,Raj,21," Okay, let's talk about something else.",8,Big Bang Theory,39,6
41833,Leonard,21," All right, so it sounds like we need a way to communicate that's simple.",8,Big Bang Theory,73,14
41834,Raj,21, And doesn't require outside machinery to be built to access it.,8,Big Bang Theory,64,11
41835,Leonard,21," It's also a problem because we don't even know if the aliens who find this can see. I mean, they might communicate in a totally different way than us.",8,Big Bang Theory,151,29
41836,Raj,21," Like when my dog is mad at me, she tells me by peeing in my slippers.",8,Big Bang Theory,70,16
41837,Leonard,21, That's actually a valid example. Animals do deliver messages through scent.,8,Big Bang Theory,76,11
41838,Raj,21, Bees talk to each other by dancing. Whales have their songs.,8,Big Bang Theory,61,11
41839,Leonard,21, Yeah. Penny has about twenty different ways of rolling her eyes that each mean something different.,8,Big Bang Theory,100,16
41840,Raj,21," Okay, so, what it sounds like is, what we want is a device that can deliver a message through not only sight, but other senses, as well.",8,Big Bang Theory,137,27
41841,Leonard,21, The most basic sense that any space-faring civilization would have to possess is touch.,8,Big Bang Theory,88,14
41842,Raj,21," Ooh. Ooh, ooh. We could make a video-playing device that simultaneously translates the information into a tactile medium.",8,Big Bang Theory,122,18
41843,Leonard,21, All we have to do is rig up a 3-D communication system.,8,Big Bang Theory,56,12
41844,Raj,21," We, we can totally do that.",8,Big Bang Theory,28,6
41845,Leonard,21, I know.,8,Big Bang Theory,8,2
41846,Raj,21, This is great.,8,Big Bang Theory,15,3
41847,Leonard,21," Yeah, you know what else it is?",8,Big Bang Theory,32,7
41848,Raj,21, What?,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
41849,Howard,21, Exactly what Sheldon and Howard said.,8,Big Bang Theory,38,6
41850,Raj,21," Well, thank you for peeing in my slippers.",8,Big Bang Theory,43,8
41852,Sheldon,21," It's the eye of the tiger, it's the ear of the bat, it's the whiskers of the catfish and the walrus.",8,Big Bang Theory,101,21
41853,Howard,21," Hang on. Not that your song isn't terrible, it is. but how do you mention bats and leave out sonar?",8,Big Bang Theory,100,20
41854,Sheldon,21," You didn't let me finish. And also regarding the bat, it has sonar.",8,Big Bang Theory,68,13
41855,Leonard,21, Hey.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
41856,Howard,21, Hello.,8,Big Bang Theory,7,1
41857,Raj,21," Look, I know you guys are upset, but we've talked about it, and we think it'd be beneficial for you to be part of the project.",8,Big Bang Theory,127,26
41858,Howard,21," Well, well, well, did you hear that, Sheldon?",8,Big Bang Theory,46,8
41859,Sheldon,21, I'm sorry. I was trying to think of what rhymes with nose of the aardvark.,8,Big Bang Theory,75,15
41860,Leonard,21, We want you back on the project with us.,8,Big Bang Theory,41,9
41861,Sheldon,21," Well, well, well, did you hear that, Howard?",8,Big Bang Theory,45,8
41862,Raj,21," Look, we admit it. The idea that you guys came up with was really good, and I'd love your help.",8,Big Bang Theory,96,20
41863,Howard,21, I suppose it couldn't have been easy for you to say that.,8,Big Bang Theory,58,12
41864,Raj,21," It wasn't, so are you in?",8,Big Bang Theory,26,6
41865,Sheldon,21, Certainly.,8,Big Bang Theory,11,1
41866,Howard,21, Sure.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
41867,Leonard,21," Great. Now that we're all on the same page, let's get together tonight and work on it.",8,Big Bang Theory,87,17
41868,Sheldon,21," Get together tonight? Leonard, stop trying to control everything, and give poor Raj a chance to come up with what we should do. Go ahead, Raj.",8,Big Bang Theory,143,26
41869,Raj,21," Okay, I think we should do it right now.",8,Big Bang Theory,41,9
41870,Sheldon,21, Tonight works better for me.,8,Big Bang Theory,29,5
41871,Raj,21, Okay.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
41873,Penny,21," Okay, it's just an audition. Why am I nervous? Maybe it's a good thing. Just means I want it. And I can have it. This feels right. Why did I ever give this up?  I'm starting to remember.",8,Big Bang Theory,187,38
41875,Raj,21," So, I'd like to try a technique where no one gets steamrolled. When you talk, instead of bringing up a new idea, respect what was just said by building on it.",8,Big Bang Theory,159,31
41876,Sheldon,21," Uh, building on that, we should order dinner.",8,Big Bang Theory,46,8
41877,Leonard,21, How is that building on what he just said?,8,Big Bang Theory,43,9
41878,Howard,21," Building on what Sheldon said, I could go for Chinese.",8,Big Bang Theory,55,10
41879,Raj,21," Hang on. Building on what Leonard said, no one built on what I said.",8,Big Bang Theory,69,14
41880,Sheldon,21," Building on building on that, there's a new build-your-own pizza place on Colorado.",8,Big Bang Theory,84,13
41881,Leonard,21," Building on that, I'd like to remind you, I'm lactose intolerant.",8,Big Bang Theory,66,11
41882,Howard,21, I saw the menu. They have soy cheese.,8,Big Bang Theory,38,8
41883,Sheldon,21," Bah, you didn't say building on. You're out.",8,Big Bang Theory,45,8
41884,Leonard,21, It's not Simon Says.,8,Big Bang Theory,21,4
41885,Raj,21," Yeah, you're missing the point, Sheldon.",8,Big Bang Theory,41,6
41886,Sheldon,21," You're out, and you're out. I win. Who wants pizza?",8,Big Bang Theory,52,10
41889,Penny,21," Oh, hey.",8,Big Bang Theory,9,2
41891,Penny,21," Yeah, uh, I got a job as a pharmaceutical sales rep.",8,Big Bang Theory,53,11
41893,Penny,21," Well, kind of. But now I get to act like inflamed heart is only a mild side effect.",8,Big Bang Theory,84,18
41895,Penny,21," Yeah, it's going okay, but I do miss this sometimes.",8,Big Bang Theory,53,10
41897,Penny,21, Mmm.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
41902,Penny,21, Yeah. I started that rumour.,8,Big Bang Theory,29,5
41904,Leonard,21," Okay, since we agree on the delivery system for the message, maybe we should talk about what the message could be.",8,Big Bang Theory,115,21
41905,Raj,21," Well, I think we should show what earthlings look like.",8,Big Bang Theory,56,10
41906,Howard,21, The plaque they sent up on the Pioneer probe had a drawing of a naked man and woman on it.,8,Big Bang Theory,91,20
41907,Sheldon,21," Yeah, I never cared for that. It's advertising to predator races just how soft and squishy we are.",8,Big Bang Theory,99,18
41908,Leonard,21, Squeeze yourself.,8,Big Bang Theory,18,2
41909,Sheldon,21," Oh, don't be offended. You know, of the four of us, you have the most veal-like consistency.",8,Big Bang Theory,93,17
41910,Raj,21," Well, maybe there's a way to appear non-aggressive, but also be able to protect ourselves if necessary. Like smiling and waving with one hand, but the other hand holding the severed head of a tiger.",8,Big Bang Theory,199,35
41911,Howard,21, You want to send a passive-aggressive message out into the universe? That's ridiculous.,8,Big Bang Theory,88,13
41912,Raj,21," Oh, you mean passive-aggressive like posting pictures of you and your wife eating cosmopolitan balls that you know belong in my mouth?",8,Big Bang Theory,135,22
41913,Sheldon,21," Perhaps Howard meant passive-aggressive like asking our group to help on your project, and then only choosing Leonard.",8,Big Bang Theory,119,18
41914,Raj,21," Look, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings, but you do have strong personalities and always end up taking over.",8,Big Bang Theory,106,19
41915,Howard,21, It's not always.,8,Big Bang Theory,17,3
41916,Leonard,21," What about when we went to Comic-Con and dressed like Jabba the Hutt? You got to be Jabba's head, and I got to be his fat slug butt.",8,Big Bang Theory,133,28
41917,Sheldon,21, We looked great.,8,Big Bang Theory,17,3
41918,Leonard,21, You let a guy sit on me.,8,Big Bang Theory,25,7
41919,Howard,21, He was dressed as Princess Leia. It made a nice picture.,8,Big Bang Theory,57,11
41920,Leonard,21," I'm just saying, sometimes Raj and I feel pushed aside.",8,Big Bang Theory,56,10
41921,Raj,21," Yeah. Like when you took Sheldon to Texas and showed him all around NASA, you didn't even think to ask me and Leonard.",8,Big Bang Theory,119,23
41922,Howard,21, You know what? You're right. I should have asked you.,8,Big Bang Theory,54,10
41923,Sheldon,21," Yeah, and if he does ask you, go. It's amazing.",8,Big Bang Theory,48,10
41924,Howard,21," Okay, and if we're talking about being left out of things, you guys went to Skywalker Ranch without us.",8,Big Bang Theory,104,19
41925,Sheldon,21," Oh, I recommend that, too. That was a magical experience.",8,Big Bang Theory,58,10
41926,Leonard,21, Wait a minute. Sheldon spent a whole day with James Earl Jones and never told any of us.,8,Big Bang Theory,89,18
41927,Sheldon,21," I sure did. Oh, my goodness. Well, from Jabba's head to ice cream with Darth Vader, I'm having a heck of a ride. Yeah, look, clearly, good things happen when I'm in charge. Now, why don't you boys step aside, let me knock this project out?",8,Big Bang Theory,240,46
41928,Leonard,21," Sheldon, you're not in charge. Raj is in charge.",8,Big Bang Theory,49,9
41929,Sheldon,21," Leonard, who's really in charge? The person in charge, or those who put him in charge?",8,Big Bang Theory,87,16
41930,Raj,21," He's right. If you think about it, we're all in charge.",8,Big Bang Theory,56,11
41931,Sheldon,21," No, the guy in charge is in ch why is everyone so bad at these?",8,Big Bang Theory,64,15
41933,Penny,21," I mean, the whole experience reminded me about how much I hated about that world. You, you know, the anxiety, the depression, the negativity. I don't want to feel those things. I want to sell drugs to people who feel those things.",8,Big Bang Theory,231,42
41934,Amy,21, I can't believe you got up and walked out of an audition for a big movie.,8,Big Bang Theory,74,16
41935,Penny,21," I did. I mean, I walked in, read for the part, then stunk up the place, but then I walked right out.",8,Big Bang Theory,101,22
41937,Penny,21," I do, and you know, I don't think I've ever thanked you properly for helping me get it.",8,Big Bang Theory,88,18
41939,Penny,21," Well, thank you. You're a good friend, and you changed my life.",8,Big Bang Theory,64,12
41941,Penny,21, Sure.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
41942,Amy,21," And you probably have to invite your other friend 'cause she overheard you talking about it, and it would be awkward to exclude her.",8,Big Bang Theory,133,24
41943,Penny,21, Okay.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
41945,Penny,21, All right.,8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
41947,Penny,21," I, uh, huh.",8,Big Bang Theory,12,3
41949,Sheldon,21, Greetings from planet Earth. Just turn left at Alpha Centauri. You can't miss it.,8,Big Bang Theory,82,14
41953,Raj,22," It's, like, the best one they make, I just can't get it to work.",8,Big Bang Theory,65,14
41954,Howard,22, I'll figure it out.,8,Big Bang Theory,20,4
41955,Raj,22, It streams HD video straight to your phone while it's flying.,8,Big Bang Theory,62,11
41956,Howard,22, Nice. Where were you when I was single?,8,Big Bang Theory,40,8
41957,Leonard,22," Okay, we should leave in about an hour. You all packed?",8,Big Bang Theory,56,11
41958,Penny,22," Uh, yeah, I just need to throw in a few last minute things, you know, makeup, underwear, clothes.",8,Big Bang Theory,98,18
41959,Sheldon,22," If your bathroom floor counts as a carry-on, you're packed.",8,Big Bang Theory,60,10
41960,Amy,22," Leonard, have you ever given a high school commencement speech before?",8,Big Bang Theory,71,11
41961,Leonard,22, Nope. It's pretty exciting.,8,Big Bang Theory,28,4
41962,Sheldon,22, Aren't you afraid of being blinded?,8,Big Bang Theory,36,6
41963,Leonard,22, How would I be blinded?,8,Big Bang Theory,24,5
41964,Sheldon,22," At the end of the ceremony, all the students throw those pointy hats in the air. It's all pomp and circumstance until someone loses an eye.",8,Big Bang Theory,140,26
41965,Leonard,22, I'll take my chances.,8,Big Bang Theory,22,4
41966,Sheldon,22, Fine. I wonder if they make I told you so cards in braille.,8,Big Bang Theory,60,13
41967,Raj,22," Look, the problem with commencement speeches is that they're boring. Ooh, do you own a T-shirt cannon?",8,Big Bang Theory,103,17
41968,Howard,22, Why would he own a T-shirt cannon?,8,Big Bang Theory,35,7
41969,Raj,22, I don't know. Why do I own one?,8,Big Bang Theory,32,8
41970,Amy,22, I think it's really nice that you're sharing this experience with Penny.,8,Big Bang Theory,73,12
41971,Leonard,22," Mm, I thought it'd be fun to show her my old stomping grounds. I even know the exact spot where they used to stomp me.",8,Big Bang Theory,119,25
41973,Amy,22, With a beautiful girl on your arm.,8,Big Bang Theory,35,7
41974,Sheldon,22, And a pointy hat sticking out of your eyeball.,8,Big Bang Theory,47,9
41976,Leonard,22, How'd you get ready so fast?,8,Big Bang Theory,29,6
41977,Penny,22," Oh, I pack light. Once, I got through an entire spring break with nothing but a long T-shirt and a belt.",8,Big Bang Theory,105,21
41978,Leonard,22, Why did you need a belt?,8,Big Bang Theory,25,6
41979,Penny,22, It's called an evening look. I've never been to New Jersey before.,8,Big Bang Theory,67,12
41980,Leonard,22, It gets a bad rap from shows like Jersey Shore and Real Housewives.,8,Big Bang Theory,68,13
41981,Penny,22, So it's not really like that?,8,Big Bang Theory,30,6
41982,Leonard,22," No, it's like that. Well, I'm excited to show you around.",8,Big Bang Theory,58,11
41983,Penny,22, You think we'll have time to visit your mom over there?,8,Big Bang Theory,56,11
41984,Leonard,22," Yes. We'll also have time to put my junk in a garlic press, but I'm not doing that either.  Uh-oh. I just got an alert. Our flight's been cancelled.",8,Big Bang Theory,149,29
41985,Penny,22, What?,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
41986,Leonard,22," Yeah, looks like there's a big storm all up the East Coast.",8,Big Bang Theory,60,12
41987,Penny,22," Well, can we get on another airline?",8,Big Bang Theory,37,7
41988,Leonard,22, I don't think so.,8,Big Bang Theory,18,4
41989,Penny,22," So, that's it? We're not going?",8,Big Bang Theory,32,6
41990,Leonard,22, I guess not.,8,Big Bang Theory,13,3
41991,Penny,22," Well, that sucks.",8,Big Bang Theory,18,3
41992,Leonard,22," Yeah. I worked hard on that speech, too.",8,Big Bang Theory,41,8
41993,Penny,22, Oh. You could tell it to me.,8,Big Bang Theory,29,7
41994,Leonard,22," Oh, thank you, but I'm okay.",8,Big Bang Theory,29,6
41995,Penny,22, Are you sure? I could pretend I'm a high school cheerleader who can't control herself around esteemed alumni.,8,Big Bang Theory,110,18
41996,Leonard,22," Greetings, distinguished cheerleaders.",8,Big Bang Theory,39,3
41997,Penny,22, Ooh.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
41999,Howard,22," Okay, the WiFi extender is on, the camera's on, they're both on the same network. We should be getting an image.",8,Big Bang Theory,113,21
42000,Sheldon,22, All I see is a black screen. And my own reflection. I look sad.,8,Big Bang Theory,64,14
42001,Howard,22, Maybe we should recalibrate it.,8,Big Bang Theory,32,5
42002,Sheldon,22, All right.,8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
42003,Howard,22," Step one, rapidly flip the calibration switch from the fully up to the fully down positions for at least ten times.",8,Big Bang Theory,116,21
42004,Sheldon,22, It actually says at least?,8,Big Bang Theory,27,5
42005,Howard,22, Yeah.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
42006,Sheldon,22, Why would they say at least? Is it ten toggles? Is it a hundred toggles? You know? Is it a thousand toggles? Ten thousand toggles? A hundred thousand toggles?,8,Big Bang Theory,159,29
42007,Howard,22, Sheldon.,8,Big Bang Theory,9,1
42008,Sheldon,22, You see where I'm going with this.,8,Big Bang Theory,35,7
42009,Howard,22, Just flip the switch until the lights on the drone change to solid yellow.,8,Big Bang Theory,75,14
42010,Sheldon,22," All right, that seems simple enough. Initiating calibration sequence. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Well, I suppose ten is technically at least ten. But they're still getting at least one angry letter.",8,Big Bang Theory,231,37
42011,Howard,22, Now I rotate it horizontally on its centre axis until the lights turn green.,8,Big Bang Theory,77,14
42012,Sheldon,22," Initiating rotation sequence. Don't look at me, initiate. What does red and yellow mean?",8,Big Bang Theory,89,14
42013,Howard,22, It means the calibration failed. We have to start over.,8,Big Bang Theory,56,10
42014,Sheldon,22," Oh. Very well. Re-initiating calibration sequence. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten eleven. It's a good thing I didn't send that letter.",8,Big Bang Theory,162,26
42016,Raj,22," Mm. Hello, Daddy. What's up?",8,Big Bang Theory,29,5
42018,Raj,22," Very well, thank you.",8,Big Bang Theory,22,4
42020,Raj,22," If you could feel how soft my skin is, you wouldn't have to ask.",8,Big Bang Theory,65,14
42022,Raj,22," Oh, you're where that bill goes.",8,Big Bang Theory,33,6
42024,Raj,22," No, Daddy, no. There are lots of other ways to teach me responsibility. I know, you can give me an egg and make me take care of it for a week.",8,Big Bang Theory,143,31
42026,Raj,22," But, Daddy, I, I miss my family so much, and with you and Mummy getting a divorce, I feel sad and empty. Buying a little toy every now and then helps me fill that void. So while I can't hug you every day, flying that helicopter",8,Big Bang Theory,228,46
42028,Raj,22," Just to be clear, financially or mid-sentence?",8,Big Bang Theory,47,7
42030,Howard,22," No red and yellow, no red and yellow.",8,Big Bang Theory,38,8
42031,Sheldon,22, Yay.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
42032,Howard,22, It's green.,8,Big Bang Theory,12,2
42033,Sheldon,22," We did it. Oh, if it's this much fun to rotate, imagine when we fly it.",8,Big Bang Theory,72,16
42034,Howard,22," Okay, now all I have to do is rotate it vertically until the lights turn off.",8,Big Bang Theory,78,16
42035,Sheldon,22," Oh, no.",8,Big Bang Theory,8,2
42036,Howard,22," Oh. All right, playtime's over. Let's open this baby up.",8,Big Bang Theory,57,10
42037,Sheldon,22, Won't that void the warranty?,8,Big Bang Theory,30,5
42038,Howard,22," Sheldon, I have a master's degree in engineering. I wipe my bottom with warranties. Except for AppleCare. That pays for itself in the long run.",8,Big Bang Theory,144,25
42040,Penny,22, Hi.,8,Big Bang Theory,4,1
42041,Leonard,22," Hey, where'd you go?",8,Big Bang Theory,21,4
42042,Penny,22, I got you a little something to cheer you up.,8,Big Bang Theory,46,10
42043,Leonard,22," Really? Sex last night, pancakes this morning, am I dying?",8,Big Bang Theory,59,10
42044,Penny,22, Just open it.,8,Big Bang Theory,14,3
42045,Leonard,22, A cap and gown? Why do I need a cap and gown?,8,Big Bang Theory,46,12
42046,Penny,22, Because you are giving your commencement speech.,8,Big Bang Theory,49,7
42047,Leonard,22, What are you talking about?,8,Big Bang Theory,28,5
42048,Penny,22, I called your old high school and convinced them to let you give your speech over Skype.,8,Big Bang Theory,89,17
42049,Leonard,22, Really? That's amazing. And you gave me the robes to give it in. Thank you.,8,Big Bang Theory,76,15
42050,Penny,22," Yeah, now about those, uh, they came from a costume shop, and all they had left was sexy graduate, so they might be a little short.",8,Big Bang Theory,132,26
42051,Leonard,22," Short and sexy, that's my wheelhouse.",8,Big Bang Theory,38,6
42052,Penny,22, Yeah.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
42054,Howard,22," Boy, oh, boy, that's a lot of pieces.",8,Big Bang Theory,38,8
42055,Sheldon,22," You know what they all do, right?",8,Big Bang Theory,34,7
42056,Howard,22," Yes, of course.",8,Big Bang Theory,16,3
42057,Sheldon,22, What about this one?,8,Big Bang Theory,21,4
42058,Howard,22," Well, I, how familiar are you with miniaturized integrated logic circuits?",8,Big Bang Theory,75,11
42059,Sheldon,22, Not very.,8,Big Bang Theory,10,2
42060,Howard,22, That right there is a miniaturized integrated logic circuit.,8,Big Bang Theory,61,9
42061,Sheldon,22," So, can you get it working?",8,Big Bang Theory,28,6
42062,Howard,22, I'm an MIT-trained engineer. I've built components for the space station.,8,Big Bang Theory,74,11
42063,Sheldon,22, I thought the zero-gravity toilet didn't work.,8,Big Bang Theory,47,7
42064,Howard,22," It worked fine, it just wasn't designed for Russian cosmonauts and their potato-based diet.",8,Big Bang Theory,92,14
42065,Raj,22," Hey, guys.",8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
42066,Howard,22, Hey.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
42067,Sheldon,22, Hello.,8,Big Bang Theory,7,1
42068,Raj,22, I have to return the helicopter. My father What did you do?,8,Big Bang Theory,60,12
42069,Sheldon,22," Well, don't worry. He went to MIT. He can solve any problem, as long as it doesn't originate in a Russian man's colon.",8,Big Bang Theory,119,23
42070,Raj,22, I don't freaking believe this.,8,Big Bang Theory,31,5
42071,Howard,22," Relax, it'll be fine.",8,Big Bang Theory,22,4
42072,Raj,22," No, you have to put this back together right now, so I can return it.",8,Big Bang Theory,70,15
42073,Sheldon,22, You can't return it. Howard wiped his bottom with the warranty.,8,Big Bang Theory,64,11
42074,Raj,22, What?,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
42075,Sheldon,22, I think metaphorically. But he was in the bathroom for a while.,8,Big Bang Theory,64,12
42076,Raj,22," Howard, my father cut me off. I have to get my money back for this.",8,Big Bang Theory,68,15
42077,Howard,22, Calm down.,8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
42078,Raj,22," Okay. Okay, you're right. It's time for me to step up and take responsibility for my life. Be a man.  Hello, Mummy.",8,Big Bang Theory,116,22
42080,Raj,22," Well, I've been thinking about you. How are you doing? Are you happy, Mummy?",8,Big Bang Theory,77,14
42082,Raj,22," Well, I like to think I take mostly after you. Anyway, speaking of Daddy, I had a very strange conversation with him. He said he couldn't afford to send me money any more because of his active social life.",8,Big Bang Theory,206,39
42084,Raj,22," Well, let's not talk about him or whatever shenanigans he may or may not be up to. Let's talk about you.",8,Big Bang Theory,105,21
42086,Raj,22," All I know, Mummy, is that he's a single wealthy doctor, and now, for some reason, there's no money for your little boy.",8,Big Bang Theory,121,23
42088,Raj,22," Thank you, Mummy, I love you. Helicopters for everybody.",8,Big Bang Theory,57,9
42090,Penny,22, What's taking so long?,8,Big Bang Theory,23,4
42091,Leonard,22, I don't think this is gonna work.,8,Big Bang Theory,34,7
42092,Penny,22," Just let me see. Sweetie, you know you're supposed to wear clothes underneath a graduation gown.",8,Big Bang Theory,97,16
42093,Leonard,22," A, surprised you know that. B, I wanted to look like a sexy graduate for you.",8,Big Bang Theory,78,16
42094,Penny,22," Oh. Well, you do.",8,Big Bang Theory,18,4
42095,Leonard,22, Thank you.,8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
42096,Penny,22," Yeah. You're gonna be on Skype, they're not gonna see your legs.",8,Big Bang Theory,65,12
42097,Leonard,22," Well, I'm gonna go put on some pants just in case. But I have to say, this is very freeing.",8,Big Bang Theory,92,20
42098,Penny,22, Add a belt and I'll take you some place nice.,8,Big Bang Theory,46,10
42099,Leonard,22, Oh. Done and done.,8,Big Bang Theory,19,4
42101,Howard,22," Okay, I think I've narrowed it down to a faulty pin on the onboard communication chip.",8,Big Bang Theory,87,16
42102,Sheldon,22," Very impressive. You know, when you're done with that, can you look at this? It doesn't make smoke anymore.",8,Big Bang Theory,108,19
42103,Howard,22, One toy at a time.,8,Big Bang Theory,19,5
42104,Sheldon,22," Mm. Sorry. Ah, maybe it's for the best. I hear locomotive smoke is the second leading cause of death among train aficionados.",8,Big Bang Theory,126,22
42105,Raj,22, What's the first one?,8,Big Bang Theory,22,4
42106,Howard,22, Suicide.,8,Big Bang Theory,9,1
42107,Sheldon,22, Wrong. Obesity.,8,Big Bang Theory,16,2
42109,Howard,22, Thank you.,8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
42110,Raj,22," You guys don't have to go to the trouble. I'm back in the money now, I can just buy another helicopter.",8,Big Bang Theory,104,21
42111,Howard,22," It's not about the money. It's about solving a problem. It's why I became an engineer. It's what I like to do, it's what I'm trained to do. It's who I am.",8,Big Bang Theory,155,32
42112,Sheldon,22," Oh, look at you, the little engineer that could.",8,Big Bang Theory,49,9
42114,Howard,22, Hey.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
42115,Sheldon,22, Whoa.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
42116,Raj,22, Not cool.,8,Big Bang Theory,10,2
42118,Howard,22," There's two kinds of people in this world, those who call tech support, and those who make fun of the people who call tech support.",8,Big Bang Theory,132,25
42120,Howard,22, Ha-ha.,8,Big Bang Theory,7,1
42121,Sheldon,22, You call tech support.,8,Big Bang Theory,23,4
42122,Raj,22, What a baby.,8,Big Bang Theory,13,3
42125,Leonard,22," Members of the faculty, students, I'm excited to speak to you today. I can't help but remember the last time I was in this auditorium. Two guys from the lacrosse team played keep-away with my asthma inhaler. But enough about my ten-year reunion. I'd also like to take a moment to thank my beautiful fiancÃ©e for to helping make this speech possible, even though weather nearly prevented it.",8,Big Bang Theory,391,68
42126,Penny,22," Oh. Hello. I, I didn't know he was gonna point it at me, so, don't do drugs and stay in school.",8,Big Bang Theory,96,21
42127,Leonard,22, They're graduating.,8,Big Bang Theory,20,2
42128,Penny,22," Okay, bye.",8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
42130,Howard,22," All right, the power supply is reconnected. I think we're back in business. Let's just run a few tests before we take it outside. Sheldon, we got WiFi?",8,Big Bang Theory,152,28
42131,Sheldon,22, Check.,8,Big Bang Theory,7,1
42132,Howard,22, GPS?,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
42133,Raj,22, Check.,8,Big Bang Theory,7,1
42134,Howard,22, Battery charged?,8,Big Bang Theory,17,2
42135,Sheldon,22, Check.,8,Big Bang Theory,7,1
42137,Howard,22, All right. All systems go. In five,8,Big Bang Theory,35,7
42139,Sheldon,22, That's what my train used to do.,8,Big Bang Theory,33,7
42141,Howard,22, Give me the number. Probably wind up talking to some foreign guy who's reading from the same manual I have. ,8,Big Bang Theory,109,20
42142,Raj,22," It's my father, you jerks. Hello, Daddy.",8,Big Bang Theory,41,7
42144,Raj,22," Nothing. I was just calling to check in, make sure she's doing okay.",8,Big Bang Theory,69,13
42146,Raj,22, Really? I don't know where she'd get an idea like that. You know Mummy and her crazy imagination I'm so lucky I take after you.,8,Big Bang Theory,128,25
42148,Raj,22," Well, I try to. I certainly wouldn't be a scientist if you hadn't been my role model.  Who wants to go to Vegas in a real helicopter?",8,Big Bang Theory,134,27
42150,Leonard,22," It was L. Frank Baum who said no thief, however skillful, can rob one of knowledge, and that is why knowledge is the best and safest treasure, wow, I'm boring myself. Sorry, I can't see any of your faces right now, but I bet they look like this. Uh, you know, I, I wrote an entire speech to say how high school prepares you and what a wonderful place it is, but I hated it. Maybe high school's great if you look like this, but I didn't even feel like I existed at that school. And now that I think about it, I bet a lot of you feel the same way. So, for the remainder of my speech, this is for the invisible kids. Uh, maybe you never fit in. Or maybe you're the smallest kid in the school, or the heaviest or the weirdest. Maybe you're graduating and you still haven't had your first kiss. By the way, 19, and Geraldine Coco, wherever you are, thank you. Maybe you don't have any friends. And guess what? That's okay. While all the popular kids are off doing whatever, I don't know what they were doing 'cause I was never there.",8,Big Bang Theory,1029,201
42151,Penny,22," I'll, I'll tell you later.",8,Big Bang Theory,27,5
42152,Leonard,22," My point is, while you're spending all this time on your own, building computers or practicing your cello, what you're really doing is becoming interesting. And when people finally do notice you, they're gonna find someone a lot cooler than they thought. And for those of you who were popular in high school, it's over, sorry. Thank you and congratulations.",8,Big Bang Theory,358,60
42155,Howard,22," What happened to me? When did I become an old man baffled by modern technology? Next thing you know, I'll be hitching my pants up to my armpits and complaining about the awful music the kids are listening to.",8,Big Bang Theory,209,39
42156,Sheldon,22," It is awful, isn't it? Listen to that noise.",8,Big Bang Theory,45,9
42157,Howard,22," Hang on, hang on. It's working. I did it.",8,Big Bang Theory,42,9
42158,Raj,22, How'd you do that?,8,Big Bang Theory,19,4
42159,Howard,22," No idea, but I did it.",8,Big Bang Theory,23,6
42161,Howard,22," Well, I'm not flying it.",8,Big Bang Theory,25,5
42162,Sheldon,22, Then who is?,8,Big Bang Theory,13,3
42163,Howard,22, I don't know. Must be getting a WiFi signal from somewhere else.,8,Big Bang Theory,65,12
42164,Sheldon,22," Initiate landing sequence. Initiate landing sequence. Hey, the camera's working. Oh, look, it's me.",8,Big Bang Theory,100,14
42166,Sheldon,22," Yes, it's a robot uprising. Call the police.",8,Big Bang Theory,45,8
42168,Leonard,22, So you really think they liked it?,8,Big Bang Theory,35,7
42169,Penny,22," Oh, sweetie, it was the best speech I",8,Big Bang Theory,38,8
42170,Sheldon,22," Don't worry, everyone in here is safe.",8,Big Bang Theory,39,7
42172,Penny,23," Leonard, what time does your mom's plane get in?",8,Big Bang Theory,49,9
42173,Leonard,23," I don't know, some time tomorrow morning.",8,Big Bang Theory,42,7
42174,Penny,23, Don't you want to know for sure?,8,Big Bang Theory,33,7
42175,Leonard,23," No need to. As soon as she flies into California airspace, I'll feel a disturbance in the Force.",8,Big Bang Theory,97,18
42176,Amy,23, It's so nice both of your moms are coming in to see you guys get an award.,8,Big Bang Theory,75,17
42177,Sheldon,23," Well, my mother's been there for every honour I've won since I beat out my twin sister for the did it on the potty trophy. How does this look?",8,Big Bang Theory,143,29
42178,Penny,23," Aw, it's so nice. She's gonna love it.",8,Big Bang Theory,39,8
42179,Amy,23," Sure, his mom gets roses. When I want them, they're a bouquet of severed plant genitals.",8,Big Bang Theory,89,16
42180,Sheldon,23, You act like I didn't get you that mushroom log on Valentine's Day.,8,Big Bang Theory,68,13
42181,Amy,23," He's right. Roses die, but a moist rotting log will pump out mushrooms for two or three magical years.",8,Big Bang Theory,103,19
42182,Penny,23," You know, your mom's never been too thrilled with our relationship. Maybe I should get her something so she warms up to me.",8,Big Bang Theory,124,23
42183,Leonard,23," If you could run out and get a PhD, that might make her like you.",8,Big Bang Theory,66,15
42184,Penny,23, Really? It didn't work for you.,8,Big Bang Theory,32,6
42185,Amy,23, Do you think the moms will get along?,8,Big Bang Theory,38,8
42186,Leonard,23," Uh, I don't know. They're pretty different.",8,Big Bang Theory,44,7
42187,Sheldon,23," Maybe they'll be best friends. One of them is brilliant, one is sweet and simple. Sound familiar?",8,Big Bang Theory,98,17
42190,Sheldon,23," Oh, thank you, Mother.",8,Big Bang Theory,23,4
42192,Sheldon,23," Oh, it's quite straightforward, actually. It describes a new model of the universe that conceptualizes it as the surface of an n-dimensional superfluid.",8,Big Bang Theory,153,23
42194,Sheldon,23," What did they feed the lions, Mother?",8,Big Bang Theory,38,7
42196,Sheldon,23," Listen, Leonard's mom is a renowned psychiatrist and woman of science. Can you please keep the Bible babble to yourself while she's here?",8,Big Bang Theory,138,23
42198,Sheldon,23," Of course not. I love you. I'm just embarrassed by the things you believe, do and say.",8,Big Bang Theory,87,17
42202,Leonard,23," No, we're kind of taking it slow.",8,Big Bang Theory,34,7
42204,Leonard,23, What does that mean?,8,Big Bang Theory,21,4
42206,Leonard,23," Yes, Mother.",8,Big Bang Theory,13,2
42208,Leonard,23," I change my answer. It, it's amazing. It's hot. We can barely keep our hands off each other.",8,Big Bang Theory,93,18
42210,Leonard,23," See, this right here, what you're doing, can you please not do that around Sheldon's mom?",8,Big Bang Theory,90,16
42212,Leonard,23," Of course not. She's, she's just a very sweet and God-fearing lady, and you have to be respectful of her beliefs.",8,Big Bang Theory,114,21
42214,Leonard,23, Thank you.,8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
42216,Leonard,23, East Texas.,8,Big Bang Theory,12,2
42218,Leonard,23," Hey, look who's here.",8,Big Bang Theory,22,4
42219,Sheldon,23," Oh, Doctor Hofstadter, it's so good to see you again.",8,Big Bang Theory,54,10
42221,Sheldon,23," Oh, thank you.",8,Big Bang Theory,15,3
42222,Leonard,23, We just spent two hours in traffic. Did you think to mention to me that you liked our paper?,8,Big Bang Theory,93,19
42224,Leonard,23," That's so sweet, you think I have self-esteem.",8,Big Bang Theory,47,8
42225,Sheldon,23," Doctor Hofstadter, I want you to meet my mother, Mary.",8,Big Bang Theory,55,10
42230,Leonard,23," Subtle, mom, real subtle.",8,Big Bang Theory,26,4
42235,Howard,23, Hey.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
42241,Sheldon,23," Beverly, would you like to see the math I worked out to support our hypothesis?",8,Big Bang Theory,80,15
42242,Leonard,23," You mean, my hypothesis. I hypothesized it all by myself.",8,Big Bang Theory,58,10
42244,Sheldon,23," Ooh, good question. Everyone loves stories about Sheldon Cooper, boy genius.",8,Big Bang Theory,77,11
42246,Sheldon,23," Ooh, this is a good one.",8,Big Bang Theory,25,6
42248,Sheldon,23, Tell her about the uranium. Tell her about the uranium.,8,Big Bang Theory,56,10
42250,Sheldon,23, But I wasn't. â€˜Cause I didn't have any friends.,8,Big Bang Theory,50,9
42254,Sheldon,23, I was a handful.,8,Big Bang Theory,17,4
42255,Leonard,23," You still are. Uh, Mom, hey, tell Mary the story about how I made a Van der Graaf generator out of our vacuum cleaner.",8,Big Bang Theory,119,24
42258,Howard,23," I mean, for a while, everything was vampires. Now it's all zombies. I wonder what the next monster fad will be.",8,Big Bang Theory,112,21
42259,Raj,23, We haven't had a good invisible man in a while.,8,Big Bang Theory,48,10
42263,Howard,23, Kiss-ass.,8,Big Bang Theory,10,1
42265,Raj,23," Hey, I don't even live here.",8,Big Bang Theory,29,6
42267,Raj,23," I do. And some of it's wool, so dry flat if possible.",8,Big Bang Theory,54,12
42269,Sheldon,23," Oh, and here's a picture of me receiving my bachelor of science degree.",8,Big Bang Theory,72,13
42271,Sheldon,23," Well, I had just begun puberty. It was figuratively and literally one of the hairiest moments of my life.",8,Big Bang Theory,106,19
42273,Sheldon,23," Oh, true. But all the clenching in the world will not keep testicles in your abdomen.",8,Big Bang Theory,86,16
42274,Penny,23," Hey, sorry, got caught up at work. Hi, Beverly.",8,Big Bang Theory,48,9
42276,Penny,23," Sorry, I forgot.",8,Big Bang Theory,17,3
42277,Sheldon,23, You remember my mother.,8,Big Bang Theory,24,4
42278,Penny,23," Oh, yes. Hi, Mary.",8,Big Bang Theory,19,4
42280,Penny,23," Ah, yeah, now that's what I'm talking about.",8,Big Bang Theory,45,8
42281,Leonard,23," So, Mom, you haven't seen Penny since we got engaged.",8,Big Bang Theory,54,10
42282,Penny,23," Oh, yeah, let me show you the ring.",8,Big Bang Theory,36,8
42284,Sheldon,23," Oh, no, not at all. No, we, uh, found a place online that, uh, repurposes diamond drill bits.",8,Big Bang Theory,94,18
42285,Leonard,23, We did not. That's not true. Can I speak to you alone for a second?,8,Big Bang Theory,68,15
42286,Sheldon,23," Oh, sure.",8,Big Bang Theory,10,2
42287,Leonard,23, It came from Tiffany's.,8,Big Bang Theory,24,4
42288,Sheldon,23," You mean the box, right?",8,Big Bang Theory,25,5
42289,Leonard,23, Keep walking.,8,Big Bang Theory,14,2
42290,Penny,23, Really doesn't matter to me how much he spent on the ring. I think.,8,Big Bang Theory,68,14
42291,Sheldon,23, Did I misspeak about the ring?,8,Big Bang Theory,31,6
42292,Leonard,23," Yes, and we'll get back to that. But, uh, even with your mother here, you are deliberately hogging all the attention from my mom. You're like one of those elephant seal pups that steals the milk from two mothers.",8,Big Bang Theory,213,39
42293,Sheldon,23, Do you mean what marine biologists refer to as super weaning?,8,Big Bang Theory,62,11
42294,Leonard,23," Yes, you are a super weaner.",8,Big Bang Theory,29,6
42295,Sheldon,23," Well, now I have to correct you. As a bit of an elephant seal buff, the more accurate comparison would be when two mother seals actively seek to nourish the same pup. So I believe the term you're looking for is a double mother suckler.",8,Big Bang Theory,236,45
42296,Leonard,23," Yeah, you're right. That is the term I'm looking for. You are a dirty double mother suckler.",8,Big Bang Theory,93,17
42297,Sheldon,23," Okay, well, now that we have the terminology straightened out. How dare you.",8,Big Bang Theory,77,13
42298,Penny,23, We're not in a rush. We'll set a date when the time is right.,8,Big Bang Theory,62,14
42305,Penny,23," Hey, look at that. You both believe in Jewish bearded guys.",8,Big Bang Theory,60,11
42307,Penny,23, Mm-hmm.,8,Big Bang Theory,8,1
42314,Penny,23," Why don't we all stop hitting ourselves and talk about something safe, you know, like shoes or how cute little Chinese babies are.",8,Big Bang Theory,131,23
42315,Sheldon,23, It is not my fault that your mother likes me better than she likes you.,8,Big Bang Theory,72,15
42316,Leonard,23," Oh, don't flatter yourself. She likes everybody better than she likes me.",8,Big Bang Theory,74,12
42318,Raj,23, How old is this Jell-O?,8,Big Bang Theory,24,5
42320,Howard,23, Sorry we have to do this.,8,Big Bang Theory,26,6
42322,Raj,23," Yeah, maybe it's a good thing if she stops babying you so much.",8,Big Bang Theory,64,13
42323,Howard,23, She doesn't baby me.,8,Big Bang Theory,21,4
42325,Howard,23," For your information, I twisted my ankle chasing the ice cream truck.",8,Big Bang Theory,70,12
42326,Raj,23," Face it, dude, Bernadette treats you the same way your mother used to, and that was not a healthy relationship.",8,Big Bang Theory,112,20
42327,Howard,23," You're right. It's time for me to act like an adult in this marriage. Starting with my husbandly duty of taking out the trash. Bernie, I made a mess.",8,Big Bang Theory,150,29
42330,Sheldon,23," Oh, it's all right. She'll forgive you. She has to or she goes to hell.",8,Big Bang Theory,72,15
42332,Sheldon,23," Well, you doled out affection as a reward for achievement, a proven way to raise a child. Or train a rat.",8,Big Bang Theory,106,21
42334,Sheldon,23," I'd feign modesty at this point, but who would believe me? Still, you need to consider how successful Leonard's brother and sister are.",8,Big Bang Theory,136,23
42336,Sheldon,23, While my brother and sister are mouth-breathing idiots.,8,Big Bang Theory,56,8
42338,Sheldon,23," Perhaps. But my mom made me spaghetti with chopped-up hot dogs whenever I wanted, so who cares?",8,Big Bang Theory,96,17
42340,Leonard,23," Not once did my mother ever give me any love or affection for just being myself, I always had to earn it.",8,Big Bang Theory,106,22
42342,Penny,23," Yeah, and you certainly don't have to earn my love.",8,Big Bang Theory,52,10
42343,Leonard,23, Thank you.,8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
42344,Penny,23," Of course, you already knew that when you bought me this princess-cut drill bit.",8,Big Bang Theory,81,14
42345,Leonard,23, That's not what it is.,8,Big Bang Theory,23,5
42346,Penny,23," I know, I know. Zzzzzzzz.",8,Big Bang Theory,26,5
42348,Penny,23," Well, come on now, she did kind of start it.",8,Big Bang Theory,45,10
42350,Leonard,23," Oh, me.",8,Big Bang Theory,8,2
42351,Penny,23," Yeah, me, too.",8,Big Bang Theory,15,3
42353,Leonard,23, I don't really feel I deserve it.,8,Big Bang Theory,34,7
42355,Howard,23," That was a big sticky mess, but I think I got it.",8,Big Bang Theory,50,12
42356,Raj,23, Looks good.,8,Big Bang Theory,12,2
42359,Howard,23," Yes, I cleaned it up all by myself. Honestly, I don't know why you complain so okay, maybe I missed one spot. Just leave.",8,Big Bang Theory,122,24
42364,Leonard,23," Okay, Mom, let's get you back to your hotel before anyone says anything else.",8,Big Bang Theory,78,14
42366,Leonard,23," Oh, really? That's too bad.",8,Big Bang Theory,28,5
42368,Sheldon,23, I taught her that.,8,Big Bang Theory,19,4
42370,Leonard,23, Wow. When does that start?,8,Big Bang Theory,27,5
42372,Penny,23," It's okay, go ahead.",8,Big Bang Theory,21,4
42374,Leonard,23," Oh, my mother.",8,Big Bang Theory,15,3
42375,Penny,23," Oh, my God.",8,Big Bang Theory,12,3
42380,Amy,24, Can you believe it's been five years since our first date?,8,Big Bang Theory,59,11
42381,Sheldon,24, I know. Do you think I should start watching The Flash TV show?,8,Big Bang Theory,64,13
42382,Amy,24, That's what you're thinking about?,8,Big Bang Theory,35,5
42383,Sheldon,24," Well, one of the things.",8,Big Bang Theory,25,5
42384,Amy,24, Are any of them me?,8,Big Bang Theory,20,5
42385,Sheldon,24," Yes. I thought, I can't decide if I should watch The Flash TV show. I know, I'll ask Amy. Anyway.",8,Big Bang Theory,98,20
42386,Amy,24, What are you doing?,8,Big Bang Theory,20,4
42387,Sheldon,24," You're right, you did kind of kill the mood.",8,Big Bang Theory,45,9
42388,Amy,24," I didn't kill anything. You did, talking about your stupid TV show.",8,Big Bang Theory,68,12
42389,Sheldon,24, Excuse me. Starting to watch a television show that might run for years isn't a decision to take lightly. I'm wrestling with a big commitment issue here.,8,Big Bang Theory,154,27
42390,Amy,24," Really? That's the commitment issue you're wrestling with? Sheldon, do you understand the irony of your fixation on a man with super speed, while after five years all I can get out of you is a distracted make-out session on a couch?",8,Big Bang Theory,233,42
42391,Sheldon,24," Irony's not really my strong suit. But I have been getting better with sarcasm, if you want to give that a try.",8,Big Bang Theory,112,22
42392,Amy,24," Oh, sure, I'd love to.",8,Big Bang Theory,23,5
42393,Sheldon,24, Whenever you're ready.,8,Big Bang Theory,23,3
42396,Raj,24, Ooh. Hot date?,8,Big Bang Theory,15,3
42399,Raj,24," You're kidding, right?",8,Big Bang Theory,23,3
42401,Raj,24," I guess I'm just more of a Pottery Barn, Crate and Barrel kind of guy. Maybe Pier 1 if I really want to cut loose.",8,Big Bang Theory,115,25
42403,Raj,24," No, no, no. Hey, you should totally get it. In fact, I'll buy it for you.",8,Big Bang Theory,74,16
42408,Leonard,24, That was really intense.,8,Big Bang Theory,25,4
42409,Penny,24," Well, now we know, next time we go to the farmers' market, the order is petting zoo first, then buy vegetables.",8,Big Bang Theory,112,21
42410,Leonard,24, Hey.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
42411,Sheldon,24," Oh, good. You're here. I need your assistance.",8,Big Bang Theory,47,8
42412,Leonard,24, Can it wait until I put a Band-Aid on a goat bite?,8,Big Bang Theory,51,12
42413,Sheldon,24, What happened?,8,Big Bang Theory,15,2
42414,Penny,24," Oh, your buddy got mugged by some baby farm animals.",8,Big Bang Theory,53,10
42415,Sheldon,24, Been there.,8,Big Bang Theory,12,2
42416,Penny,24, Mmm. So what do you need help with?,8,Big Bang Theory,36,8
42417,Sheldon,24," Amy's mad at me, and I'm not clear why.",8,Big Bang Theory,40,9
42418,Penny,24, Okay. Were you talking before she got upset?,8,Big Bang Theory,45,8
42419,Sheldon,24, Yes.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
42420,Penny,24, That's probably it. What'd you say to her?,8,Big Bang Theory,43,8
42421,Sheldon,24," Well, I just asked her if I should start watching the new Flash TV series.",8,Big Bang Theory,75,15
42422,Penny,24, And that made her angry?,8,Big Bang Theory,25,5
42423,Sheldon,24," Baffling, right? We were necking like a couple of hooligans under the school bleachers. I stopped so I could ask the question. Next thing I know, good-bye, kissy face. Hello, yelly face.",8,Big Bang Theory,187,32
42424,Penny,24," Well, Sheldon, when you're kissing a girl, she expects the attention to be on her.",8,Big Bang Theory,83,15
42425,Sheldon,24, It was. I asked her if she thought I should watch The Flash.,8,Big Bang Theory,61,13
42426,Penny,24, Yeah. I'm tapping out. Leonard?,8,Big Bang Theory,32,5
42427,Leonard,24, I'm gonna guess that your main concern is the time commitment of watching an entire season of a new show.,8,Big Bang Theory,106,20
42428,Sheldon,24," Oh, no, not just a season. If I'm in, I'm in for the whole run, even if the quality declines.",8,Big Bang Theory,94,20
42429,Leonard,24, I get it. Smallville almost wrecked you.,8,Big Bang Theory,41,7
42430,Sheldon,24," Yeah. Exactly. You know, I waited ten years to see a guy everyone knows can fly, fly.",8,Big Bang Theory,86,17
42431,Penny,24," Wait, what is wrong with you two? He was talking about television during their date night.",8,Big Bang Theory,91,16
42432,Sheldon,24," Oh, not just date night, our fifth anniversary.",8,Big Bang Theory,48,8
42433,Penny,24," Okay, see, that's even dumber than you wondering if being bitten by a goat would give you the powers of a goat.",8,Big Bang Theory,112,22
42434,Sheldon,24," If that happens, don't make me wait ten years to watch you eat a tin can.",8,Big Bang Theory,74,16
42436,Raj,24, You guys ever notice that Emily has a bit of a twisted side?,8,Big Bang Theory,61,13
42438,Raj,24," No, because she wants to have sex with me in a graveyard.",8,Big Bang Theory,58,12
42439,Howard,24, One more time?,8,Big Bang Theory,15,3
42440,Raj,24," She and I were supposed to watch the new Avengers movie tonight, but it was sold out. So I said, what else do you want to do? She said, let's go to a cemetery and do it on somebody's grave.",8,Big Bang Theory,190,40
42441,Howard,24," Like, a random person or somebody she knew?",8,Big Bang Theory,44,8
42442,Raj,24, What difference does it make?,8,Big Bang Theory,30,5
42443,Howard,24," Well, if it's her father's grave and they didn't get along, then you know she holds a grudge.",8,Big Bang Theory,94,18
42445,Raj,24," Well, what if it's one consenting adult and one adult who pretends to consent because he's afraid of being alone?",8,Big Bang Theory,114,20
42447,Raj,24," I don't know, guys. Maybe this relationship isn't for me. Maybe I should break up with her.",8,Big Bang Theory,92,17
42448,Howard,24, Right. You're gonna break up with a girl who has sex with you. Can you believe this guy?,8,Big Bang Theory,89,18
42450,Howard,24, How are you saying that with a straight face?,8,Big Bang Theory,46,9
42452,Raj,24, You guys are being jerks.,8,Big Bang Theory,26,5
42453,Howard,24," Buddy, other than Jenny Craig, you've never broken up with a girl in your life.",8,Big Bang Theory,80,15
42454,Raj,24, You're one to talk. You've been complaining about Stuart living here for the past year. I don't see you showing him the door.,8,Big Bang Theory,126,23
42455,Howard,24," That's not the same thing. Emily's a person. Stuart's more like an infestation, something you spray for.",8,Big Bang Theory,105,17
42456,Raj,24," Baloney, okay? You two are as afraid of hurting someone's feelings as I am.",8,Big Bang Theory,76,14
42459,Penny,24, Thanks for cooking.,8,Big Bang Theory,20,3
42460,Leonard,24, Mmm. My pleasure.,8,Big Bang Theory,18,3
42461,Penny,24, That carrot was delicious.,8,Big Bang Theory,27,4
42462,Leonard,24, Yeah. I wish I'd fought harder for the rest of 'em.,8,Big Bang Theory,52,11
42463,Penny,24, Still haven't heard from her?,8,Big Bang Theory,30,5
42464,Sheldon,24," No, and I'm confused. It's been nearly 24 hours. Amy should have figured out she's wrong by now.",8,Big Bang Theory,97,18
42465,Penny,24," Hey, I don't think she's wrong about you going too slow in the relationship.",8,Big Bang Theory,77,14
42466,Sheldon,24, Too slow?,8,Big Bang Theory,10,2
42467,Penny,24," Yeah, you've been going out for years. You haven't even slept together.",8,Big Bang Theory,72,12
42468,Sheldon,24, That's right. It's called foreplay. And I could make the case that you two aren't moving forward in your relationship.,8,Big Bang Theory,119,20
42469,Penny,24," Uh, hello.",8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
42470,Sheldon,24, Hello.,8,Big Bang Theory,7,1
42471,Penny,24," No. Sheldon, we're getting married.",8,Big Bang Theory,36,5
42472,Sheldon,24," But you've been engaged for over a year now, and you don't even have a wedding date.",8,Big Bang Theory,85,17
42473,Penny,24," Well, we will. We're just not in a rush.",8,Big Bang Theory,41,9
42474,Sheldon,24, Okay.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
42475,Leonard,24, We're gonna set a date.,8,Big Bang Theory,24,5
42476,Sheldon,24, Okay. If you say so.,8,Big Bang Theory,21,5
42477,Penny,24," Yeah, it's just, things are good right now.",8,Big Bang Theory,44,8
42478,Leonard,24, Really good.,8,Big Bang Theory,13,2
42479,Penny,24, I'm focusing on my job.,8,Big Bang Theory,24,5
42480,Leonard,24, And we've been busy with our paper.,8,Big Bang Theory,36,7
42481,Penny,24, So busy.,8,Big Bang Theory,9,2
42482,Leonard,24," Yeah, we'll pick a date when we pick a date.",8,Big Bang Theory,45,10
42483,Penny,24, Yeah.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
42484,Sheldon,24, Okay.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
42485,Penny,24," You know, I can see why Amy's mad at you.",8,Big Bang Theory,42,10
42486,Sheldon,24," Yeah, shut up, Sheldon.",8,Big Bang Theory,24,4
42489,Howard,24, You mean the one that makes ladies do the thing that ladies pretend they don't do even though they do?,8,Big Bang Theory,103,20
42491,Howard,24, I didn't touch it. Must have been Stuart.,8,Big Bang Theory,42,8
42493,Howard,24, We should have done it months ago.,8,Big Bang Theory,35,7
42495,Howard,24," Yeah, right. Sick. He didn't have jaundice. He just looks like that.",8,Big Bang Theory,69,12
42497,Howard,24," Agreed. When he gets home, I'm dropping the hammer.",8,Big Bang Theory,52,9
42499,Howard,24," Oh, I'm not taking charge, you're the hammer.",8,Big Bang Theory,46,8
42501,Leonard,24," So, why haven't we picked a date?",8,Big Bang Theory,34,7
42502,Penny,24, You know why.,8,Big Bang Theory,14,3
42503,Leonard,24," Well, of course I know why. But just for fun, why?",8,Big Bang Theory,51,11
42504,Penny,24," Not in a rush, busy with work",8,Big Bang Theory,30,7
42505,Sheldon,24, Things are good right now.,8,Big Bang Theory,27,5
42506,Penny,24, Really good.,8,Big Bang Theory,13,2
42507,Leonard,24," You still want to get married, right?",8,Big Bang Theory,38,7
42508,Penny,24," Oh, my God. Yes. Why would you even ask that?",8,Big Bang Theory,46,10
42509,Leonard,24, I don't know. Because we don't have a date?,8,Big Bang Theory,44,9
42510,Penny,24," Well, you want a date, pick a date.",8,Big Bang Theory,36,8
42511,Leonard,24," It's not just the date. We haven't talked about anything. Big wedding, small wedding, indoor, outdoor?",8,Big Bang Theory,103,16
42512,Sheldon,24, Outdoor? Oh. I can RSVP no right now.,8,Big Bang Theory,38,8
42513,Penny,24," Okay, indoor it is. Big or small?",8,Big Bang Theory,34,7
42514,Leonard,24, Is your dad paying for it?,8,Big Bang Theory,27,6
42515,Penny,24, I doubt it.,8,Big Bang Theory,12,3
42516,Leonard,24," Okay, two friends each.",8,Big Bang Theory,24,4
42517,Penny,24," All right, well, I want it in a church.",8,Big Bang Theory,40,9
42518,Leonard,24, Fine. I want black-tie.,8,Big Bang Theory,24,4
42519,Penny,24, Fine. I want to release butterflies.,8,Big Bang Theory,37,6
42520,Sheldon,24, Seriously? Airborne worms?,8,Big Bang Theory,27,3
42521,Leonard,24," Okay. Well, then it's settled. Small indoor church wedding, black-tie, no butterflies.",8,Big Bang Theory,87,12
42522,Penny,24, Sounds perfect.,8,Big Bang Theory,16,2
42523,Leonard,24, Great.,8,Big Bang Theory,7,1
42524,Sheldon,24, You still didn't pick a date.,8,Big Bang Theory,30,6
42525,Penny,24, Stay out of it.,8,Big Bang Theory,16,4
42526,Leonard,24, Shut up.,8,Big Bang Theory,9,2
42529,Raj,24," Oh, yes, we've got the moon and the trees and Elizabeth McNulty, who apparently died when she was the same age I am.",8,Big Bang Theory,117,23
42531,Raj,24," So does enjoying a meal at a well-lit restaurant, but here we are.",8,Big Bang Theory,67,13
42533,Raj,24," Of ghosts, no. Of you, little bit.",8,Big Bang Theory,35,7
42535,Sheldon,24, I'm sorry I've upset you. I shouldn't have asked so many questions.,8,Big Bang Theory,68,12
42536,Penny,24," No, it's okay.",8,Big Bang Theory,15,3
42537,Leonard,24," Yeah, maybe it's good you got us talking about this stuff.",8,Big Bang Theory,59,11
42538,Sheldon,24," Well, look at that, even when I'm causing problems, I make the world a better place. Hey, next, why don't we tackle your penchant for whining and Penny's love of the ol' glug-glug?",8,Big Bang Theory,181,33
42539,Penny,24," Uh, Sheldon, I think we're good for now.",8,Big Bang Theory,41,8
42540,Sheldon,24," Ah, well, very well. So does this mean you'll finally pick a wedding date?",8,Big Bang Theory,75,14
42541,Penny,24, Here we go again. Why is everyone so concerned with us setting a date? We're committed to each other. We're happy. A ceremony isn't gonna change anything.,8,Big Bang Theory,155,27
42542,Sheldon,24," So you're never getting married? It's his whining, isn't it?",8,Big Bang Theory,61,10
42543,Leonard,24," Sheldon, I'm not a whiner.",8,Big Bang Theory,27,5
42544,Sheldon,24, It's amusing that he doesn't hear it.,8,Big Bang Theory,38,7
42545,Leonard,24," Look, all she's saying is we are in love so it doesn't matter if we get married tomorrow or a year from now or 50 years from now.",8,Big Bang Theory,130,28
42546,Penny,24," Ew, 50? We'll be old and gross.",8,Big Bang Theory,32,7
42547,Leonard,24," Yeah, but we'll be old and gross together.",8,Big Bang Theory,43,8
42548,Sheldon,24," My aunt and uncle were married 63 years. Towards the end, it was like watching cheese melt.",8,Big Bang Theory,92,17
42549,Penny,24," Um, I'm free tonight.",8,Big Bang Theory,22,4
42550,Leonard,24, Are you saying you want to get married?,8,Big Bang Theory,40,8
42551,Penny,24, Vegas isn't that far away.,8,Big Bang Theory,27,5
42552,Leonard,24, I'm in. Let's do it.,8,Big Bang Theory,21,5
42553,Sheldon,24, After all these years. I'm really happy for the two of you.,8,Big Bang Theory,60,12
42554,Penny,24," Oh, thank you.",8,Big Bang Theory,15,3
42555,Leonard,24, Thanks.,8,Big Bang Theory,8,1
42556,Sheldon,24, Now get out of my spot.,8,Big Bang Theory,24,6
42558,Howard,24," Bernie, Stuart just pulled up. So remember, the key is to be firm. Show no weakness.",8,Big Bang Theory,85,16
42560,Howard,24, Good luck.,8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
42562,Howard,24, Never should have told you my middle name.,8,Big Bang Theory,43,8
42564,Howard,24," Hey, you got a minute?",8,Big Bang Theory,23,5
42567,Howard,24, It's hard not to. They taste so much better than real berries.,8,Big Bang Theory,63,12
42572,Raj,24, I think we should talk.,8,Big Bang Theory,24,5
42578,Howard,24, His middle name is David. Go.,8,Big Bang Theory,30,6
42580,Raj,24," Look, I care about you a lot, but we are very different people.",8,Big Bang Theory,64,13
42582,Raj,24," No, no, I'm just pointing out that you're dark on the inside and I'm dark on the outside.",8,Big Bang Theory,90,18
42585,Howard,24, You need to take that?,8,Big Bang Theory,23,5
42589,Raj,24, End things? I'm trying to tell you that I love you.,8,Big Bang Theory,52,11
42593,Penny,24," Wow, there's a Denny's in Vegas you can actually get married in.",8,Big Bang Theory,65,12
42594,Leonard,24, Doesn't sound very romantic.,8,Big Bang Theory,29,4
42595,Penny,24," Yeah, but we could get heart-shaped pancakes.",8,Big Bang Theory,46,7
42596,Leonard,24, I'm sure we'll find a decent chapel.,8,Big Bang Theory,37,7
42597,Penny,24, Yeah. This is crazy.,8,Big Bang Theory,21,4
42598,Leonard,24, I know. You think people are gonna be mad?,8,Big Bang Theory,43,9
42599,Penny,24," Maybe. But this isn't about them, it's about us.",8,Big Bang Theory,49,9
42600,Leonard,24, It is. It is about us.,8,Big Bang Theory,23,6
42601,Penny,24," And you know what the best part is? We took our time. I mean, we met, we were friends for a couple years, then we got together, and then we got untogether, then we worked out all our problems, and now we know everything about each other, we can just go forward with no surprises and no regrets.",8,Big Bang Theory,295,58
42602,Leonard,24, Right. No surprises.,8,Big Bang Theory,21,3
42603,Penny,24, And no regrets.,8,Big Bang Theory,16,3
42604,Leonard,24," Uh, well, there, there's one thing I feel I should tell you.",8,Big Bang Theory,61,12
42605,Penny,24, What?,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
42606,Leonard,24," You know, so we can go into this with no secrets between us.",8,Big Bang Theory,61,13
42607,Penny,24, What?,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
42608,Leonard,24," Remember, uh, a couple years back when I was on that research ship in the North Sea?",8,Big Bang Theory,85,17
42609,Penny,24, Yeah.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
42610,Leonard,24," Okay, well, there, there was a lot of drinking and craziness going on.",8,Big Bang Theory,71,13
42611,Penny,24," No, you told me.",8,Big Bang Theory,17,4
42612,Leonard,24," Okay, um, well, there was this girl.",8,Big Bang Theory,37,7
42613,Penny,24, What did you do?,8,Big Bang Theory,17,4
42614,Leonard,24, Nothing really. It was just kissing.,8,Big Bang Theory,37,6
42615,Penny,24, And then what?,8,Big Bang Theory,15,3
42616,Leonard,24," And then nothing. I stopped it. But it still bothers me, and I wanted you to know.",8,Big Bang Theory,83,17
42617,Penny,24, All right.,8,Big Bang Theory,11,2
42618,Leonard,24, Did you ever do anything like this since we've been?,8,Big Bang Theory,53,10
42619,Penny,24," Nope, never.",8,Big Bang Theory,13,2
42620,Leonard,24," Oh, that's too bad.",8,Big Bang Theory,20,4
42621,Penny,24," You know, can I ask you a question?",8,Big Bang Theory,36,8
42622,Leonard,24, Hmm?,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
42623,Penny,24, Why are you telling me this now?,8,Big Bang Theory,33,7
42624,Leonard,24," Well, like I said, we're about to get married, and I, I want a clean slate. No secrets.",8,Big Bang Theory,88,18
42625,Penny,24," Really? Because to me, it seems like we're about to get married and you're trying to sabotage it.",8,Big Bang Theory,98,18
42626,Leonard,24, Would you rather I didn't tell you?,8,Big Bang Theory,36,7
42627,Penny,24," No, I don't want there to be secrets between us.",8,Big Bang Theory,49,10
42628,Leonard,24," See, now I'm confused. I mean, what, what am I supposed to do?",8,Big Bang Theory,63,13
42629,Penny,24," Uh, keep your mouth off other women.",8,Big Bang Theory,37,7
42630,Leonard,24," I can do that. Uh, uh, from now on, this mouth, you and food, that's it.",8,Big Bang Theory,73,16
42631,Penny,24, Okay.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
42632,Leonard,24, Yeah?,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
42633,Penny,24," Look, I'm not happy this happened, but I think I can get past it. I mean, we weren't engaged at the time, and it was just kissing.",8,Big Bang Theory,131,27
42634,Leonard,24, Right.,8,Big Bang Theory,7,1
42635,Penny,24, Just kissing.,8,Big Bang Theory,14,2
42636,Leonard,24," It wasn't even very good. She was a smoker, I'd just been seasick.",8,Big Bang Theory,67,13
42637,Penny,24," Okay, that's enough. Stop talking.",8,Big Bang Theory,35,5
42638,Leonard,24," So, we're still getting married?",8,Big Bang Theory,33,5
42639,Penny,24, Yes.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
42640,Leonard,24, Because we love each other.,8,Big Bang Theory,28,5
42641,Penny,24, Yes.,8,Big Bang Theory,5,1
42642,Leonard,24, And it's the happiest day of our lives.,8,Big Bang Theory,40,8
42643,Penny,24," Ha-ha, don't push it.",8,Big Bang Theory,22,4
42645,Amy,24, Hello.,8,Big Bang Theory,7,1
42646,Sheldon,24," Hello. Listen, I've been thinking a lot about relationships and how difficult they can be, and I think",8,Big Bang Theory,103,18
42647,Amy,24," I've been thinking about them, too, Sheldon. Being your girlfriend is so challenging. Emotionally, physically. I've been incredibly patient for years.",8,Big Bang Theory,151,21
42648,Sheldon,24, Strongly disagree. Go on.,8,Big Bang Theory,26,4
42649,Amy,24," Okay, well, this isn't easy to say, because I love you, but I need some time to take a step back and re-evaluate our situation.",8,Big Bang Theory,128,25
42650,Sheldon,24, Oh.,8,Big Bang Theory,4,1
42651,Amy,24, I hope you understand.,8,Big Bang Theory,23,4
42652,Sheldon,24, Okay.,8,Big Bang Theory,6,1
42653,Amy,24," Bye, Sheldon.",8,Big Bang Theory,14,2
42654,Sheldon,24," Well, Gollum, you're an expert on rings. What do I do with this one?",8,Big Bang Theory,69,14
42656,Penny,1," So, what package are you thinking?",9,Big Bang Theory,35,6
42657,Leonard,1," Mm, this one comes with music and flowers. Oh, they even stream the whole thing live on the Internet.",9,Big Bang Theory,102,19
42658,Penny,1, Why would we want that?,9,Big Bang Theory,24,5
42659,Leonard,1," â€˜Cause there's a lot of gorgeous blondes out there who don't believe they can land a short, nearsighted scientist. Let's give them hope.",9,Big Bang Theory,139,23
42660,Penny,1, Whatever. Put us on the Internet. I've always wanted a wedding with a comment section.,9,Big Bang Theory,87,15
42661,Leonard,1," If you're not into this, we can do it another time.",9,Big Bang Theory,52,11
42662,Penny,1," No. No, I want to. Look, we've put this off long enough. Let's do it.",9,Big Bang Theory,70,15
42663,Leonard,1," Aw. That's exactly what you said the first time we slept together.  Oh, excuse me. Sheldon. Hey.",9,Big Bang Theory,97,17
42664,Sheldon,1," Leonard, have you gotten married yet?",9,Big Bang Theory,38,6
42665,Leonard,1, No. Why?,9,Big Bang Theory,9,2
42666,Sheldon,1, Good. Don't do it.,9,Big Bang Theory,19,4
42667,Leonard,1, Why not?,9,Big Bang Theory,9,2
42668,Sheldon,1," Some important new information has come to light. Women are the worst. I thought it was paper cuts, but I was wrong. No piece of paper ever cut me this deep.",9,Big Bang Theory,158,31
42669,Leonard,1, What happened now?,9,Big Bang Theory,19,3
42670,Sheldon,1, Amy has ended our relationship.,9,Big Bang Theory,32,5
42671,Leonard,1," Oh, no. Seriously?",9,Big Bang Theory,19,3
42672,Penny,1, What's going on?,9,Big Bang Theory,17,3
42673,Leonard,1, Amy broke up with Sheldon.,9,Big Bang Theory,27,5
42674,Penny,1, She did?,9,Big Bang Theory,9,2
42675,Sheldon,1, Is Penny crying?,9,Big Bang Theory,17,3
42676,Leonard,1, No.,9,Big Bang Theory,4,1
42677,Sheldon,1," No, of course not. They thrive on our suffering.",9,Big Bang Theory,49,9
42678,Leonard,1," Buddy, I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do?",9,Big Bang Theory,49,10
42679,Sheldon,1," Yes. If I ever talk about going out with a girl again, roll your eyes at me like I do to you when you say dumb things.",9,Big Bang Theory,119,27
42680,Leonard,1," Sheldon, uh, okay, just because you're going through this with Amy doesn't mean that all women are bad.",9,Big Bang Theory,104,18
42681,Sheldon,1, Whatever.,9,Big Bang Theory,10,1
42682,Penny,1," Hey, I just heard about you and Sheldon. Are you okay?",9,Big Bang Theory,55,11
42683,Amy,1, Not really. Can you come over?,9,Big Bang Theory,31,6
42684,Penny,1," Uh, actually I'm in Vegas. Leonard and I are about to get married.",9,Big Bang Theory,67,13
42685,Amy,1, Hold on. You're getting married and you didn't invite me?,9,Big Bang Theory,58,10
42686,Penny,1," Well, it was kind of a spur-of-the-moment thing.",9,Big Bang Theory,49,8
42687,Amy,1, Wow. Hope I can catch the bouquet from here.,9,Big Bang Theory,45,9
42688,Penny,1," Amy, don't be like that.",9,Big Bang Theory,25,5
42689,Sheldon,1, Why did I just hear Amy's name?,9,Big Bang Theory,32,7
42690,Leonard,1, Penny's on the phone with her.,9,Big Bang Theory,31,6
42691,Sheldon,1," Did she say anything about me? Never mind. I don't care. Well, if you care, you can find out and tell me. Just don't be shocked when you find out that I don't care.",9,Big Bang Theory,165,34
42692,Penny,1," Okay, will you relax? You're not missing anything special.",9,Big Bang Theory,59,9
42693,Leonard,1, Hey.,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
42694,Penny,1," She's upset. Look, it's gonna be a great wedding. Look at you in your little suit.",9,Big Bang Theory,83,16
42695,Sheldon,1, Amy's upset? Is it about me?,9,Big Bang Theory,29,6
42696,Leonard,1," No, I think it's because we're eloping.",9,Big Bang Theory,40,7
42697,Sheldon,1," Your marriage is causing her pain? Yeah, great, I take it back. Go ahead and do it. Yay for love.",9,Big Bang Theory,98,20
42699,Sheldon,1, Hello.,9,Big Bang Theory,7,1
42700,Amy,1, Oh. What are you doing here?,9,Big Bang Theory,29,6
42701,Sheldon,1," When last we spoke, you said you needed time.",9,Big Bang Theory,46,9
42702,Amy,1," Well, it's only been 11 hours.",9,Big Bang Theory,31,6
42703,Sheldon,1," The Lord of the Rings trilogy was nearly 11 hours. I made you watch that, you said it was an eternity.",9,Big Bang Theory,103,21
42704,Amy,1," Sheldon, when I'm ready to talk, I'll let you know.",9,Big Bang Theory,52,10
42705,Sheldon,1, Very well. You seem to be headed somewhere. May I walk with you?,9,Big Bang Theory,65,13
42706,Amy,1, Sure.,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
42707,Sheldon,1," Boy, I'm glad we're going out again.",9,Big Bang Theory,37,7
42708,Amy,1, We're not back together.,9,Big Bang Theory,25,4
42709,Sheldon,1," Why? Is there someone else? Just couldn't wait for that first notch on your bedpost, could you?",9,Big Bang Theory,96,17
42710,Amy,1," If you must know, I'm going to Howard and Bernadette's to watch the wedding.",9,Big Bang Theory,77,14
42711,Sheldon,1, And who's this guy you're taking?,9,Big Bang Theory,34,6
42712,Amy,1, There's no guy.,9,Big Bang Theory,16,3
42713,Sheldon,1," Oh, you're going to a wedding alone? That's sad.",9,Big Bang Theory,49,9
42714,Amy,1, I'm not gonna be alone. I'll be with my friends.,9,Big Bang Theory,49,10
42715,Sheldon,1," Your friends? Well, I think you mean my friends. And why wasn't I invited to this?",9,Big Bang Theory,83,16
42716,Amy,1, Maybe because the two of us being there would make them feel awkward.,9,Big Bang Theory,70,13
42717,Sheldon,1, We make everyone feel awkward. That's our thing.,9,Big Bang Theory,49,8
42719,Leonard,1, They're running a little behind. Should be pretty soon.,9,Big Bang Theory,56,9
42720,Penny,1, Okay.,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
42721,Leonard,1," Hey, if you're hungry, there's a breakfast buffet at the strip club next door.",9,Big Bang Theory,79,14
42722,Penny,1," Thanks, but I don't like glitter on my scrambled eggs.",9,Big Bang Theory,55,10
42723,Leonard,1," I don't think the strippers prepare the meal, but okay. Look, it's not how I pictured it either, but I'm still glad we're doing it.",9,Big Bang Theory,132,25
42724,Penny,1," Me, too.",9,Big Bang Theory,9,2
42725,Leonard,1, You sure?,9,Big Bang Theory,10,2
42726,Penny,1, Yes.,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
42727,Leonard,1, And you promise you're okay with everything from the car?,9,Big Bang Theory,58,10
42728,Penny,1," Oh, my God, would you stop bringing it up?",9,Big Bang Theory,43,9
42729,Leonard,1, You're right. I'm sorry. We have the rest of our lives to dredge stuff up from the past and fight about it. So what do you think? Should we run next door and grab a bite?,9,Big Bang Theory,171,36
42730,Penny,1, What if they call our names?,9,Big Bang Theory,29,6
42731,Leonard,1," Oh, don't worry. They gave me this vibrating coaster.",9,Big Bang Theory,54,9
42732,Penny,1," Oh, and the fairy tale continues.",9,Big Bang Theory,34,6
42734,Amy,1, Thank you for doing this.,9,Big Bang Theory,26,5
42736,Amy,1," We were together for so long, I honestly don't know what I'm feeling.",9,Big Bang Theory,70,13
42737,Howard,1," Well, that's understandable. You forgot. It's called happy.",9,Big Bang Theory,60,8
42739,Howard,1, I'm not saying anything bad. Just that she was in love with her captor and somehow managed to escape from his dark and crazy dungeon.,9,Big Bang Theory,134,25
42741,Amy,1, Oh. What was her name?,9,Big Bang Theory,23,5
42744,Sheldon,1, I didn't want to come in. I was told it would make everyone feel uncomfortable. So I'll just stay out here and pretend that I don't have to go to the bathroom.,9,Big Bang Theory,160,32
42746,Howard,1, I'm on it.,9,Big Bang Theory,11,3
42747,Amy,1," Sheldon, you being here might not be making things better.",9,Big Bang Theory,59,10
42748,Sheldon,1, I see. And is that why everybody was invited but me?,9,Big Bang Theory,53,11
42749,Amy,1," They didn't invite everybody but you.Bernadette invited me, and Stuart lives here.",9,Big Bang Theory,83,12
42750,Raj,1, Who wants hot cinnamon rolls?,9,Big Bang Theory,30,5
42753,Leonard,1," Oh, the package that we paid for said the aisle was supposed to be strewn with rose petals.",9,Big Bang Theory,92,18
42755,Leonard,1, You know what? It's fine.,9,Big Bang Theory,26,5
42757,Penny,1," Really, we're good.",9,Big Bang Theory,20,3
42758,Leonard,1," Yup, just want to get married.",9,Big Bang Theory,31,6
42759,Penny,1, Yeah.,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
42761,Leonard,1, This is it.,9,Big Bang Theory,12,3
42762,Penny,1, I know.,9,Big Bang Theory,8,2
42763,Leonard,1, I love you.,9,Big Bang Theory,12,3
42764,Penny,1," I love you, too.",9,Big Bang Theory,17,4
42766,Penny,1," No, thank you.",9,Big Bang Theory,15,3
42767,Leonard,1, We're good.,9,Big Bang Theory,12,2
42769,Sheldon,1," Raj, you're probably wondering why Amy and I aren't showing any affection to one another.",9,Big Bang Theory,90,15
42770,Raj,1, Didn't even crack the top ten.,9,Big Bang Theory,31,6
42771,Sheldon,1," Well, you should know that she recently broke up with me.",9,Big Bang Theory,58,11
42772,Amy,1, I said I needed time to think.,9,Big Bang Theory,31,7
42773,Raj,1, I'm sure you guys will figure something out.,9,Big Bang Theory,45,8
42774,Sheldon,1, You hear that? Raj is devastated.,9,Big Bang Theory,34,6
42776,Sheldon,1," I see what's happening. Sides are forming. Well, if Bernadette's on Amy's team, I pick Howard.",9,Big Bang Theory,95,16
42777,Howard,1, I'm not taking sides.,9,Big Bang Theory,22,4
42778,Sheldon,1," Fine, I guess I'm stuck with Raj.",9,Big Bang Theory,34,7
42779,Raj,1, Really?,9,Big Bang Theory,8,1
42783,Leonard,1, Yes.,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
42784,Penny,1, No. You wrote vows?,9,Big Bang Theory,20,4
42785,Leonard,1, Yeah.,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
42786,Penny,1," Well, I don't have any. You're kind of making me look bad.",9,Big Bang Theory,59,12
42787,Leonard,1, It's okay. I don't have to say them.,9,Big Bang Theory,37,8
42788,Penny,1," No, no, no, go ahead. I'll come up with something mushy, you'll cry, we got this.",9,Big Bang Theory,82,16
42789,Leonard,1," Penny, we are made of particles that have existed since the moment the universe began. I like to think those atoms travelled 14 billion years through time and space to create us, so that we could be together and make each other whole.",9,Big Bang Theory,235,43
42790,Penny,1, Wow.,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
42792,Penny,1," Right. Um, okay. Leonard, I mean, you're not only the love of my life. I mean, you're my best friend, and, you've got a friend in me. You got troubles. I got 'em, too. There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you. We stick together, and we can see it through, 'cause you've got a friend in me.",9,Big Bang Theory,292,58
42794,Penny,1, He loves that movie.,9,Big Bang Theory,21,4
42795,Leonard,1, I do.,9,Big Bang Theory,6,2
42798,Howard,1," Yeah. I mean, not like our wedding beautiful.",9,Big Bang Theory,46,8
42800,Sheldon,1," Amy, I don't understand, are we broken up or not? It's like you can't make up your mind.",9,Big Bang Theory,89,18
42801,Amy,1, It's because you're not giving me any space to think.,9,Big Bang Theory,54,10
42802,Sheldon,1," Well, you should think fast, because men can sire offspring their entire lives, but those eggs you're toting around have a sell-by date.",9,Big Bang Theory,137,23
42803,Amy,1," You know what, Sheldon, you've made this really easy. You're immature, you're selfish, you just insulted me to my face. I don't need any more time to think. We're broken up.",9,Big Bang Theory,174,31
42805,Sheldon,1, Will someone take me home?,9,Big Bang Theory,27,5
42806,Raj,1," Yeah. Come on, I'll give you a ride.",9,Big Bang Theory,37,8
42807,Penny,1, We did it.,9,Big Bang Theory,11,3
42808,Leonard,1," Yeah, I'm so glad you guys could watch.",9,Big Bang Theory,40,8
42809,Howard,1, We'll say it was beautiful in the comment section.,9,Big Bang Theory,51,9
42811,Leonard,1," No, no, no. Hang on. I believe I'm supposed to carry you across the threshold.",9,Big Bang Theory,79,15
42812,Penny,1, Can you?,9,Big Bang Theory,9,2
42813,Leonard,1, Who do you think carries Sheldon to bed when he falls asleep in front of the TV?,9,Big Bang Theory,81,17
42814,Penny,1," Okay, let's do it. You gonna make it?",9,Big Bang Theory,38,8
42815,Leonard,1, I'm okay.,9,Big Bang Theory,10,2
42816,Penny,1, Nicely done.,9,Big Bang Theory,13,2
42817,Leonard,1," Thank you. Finally, there's a Mrs. Hofstadter who isn't disappointed in me.",9,Big Bang Theory,76,12
42818,Penny,1," Well, the night is still young.",9,Big Bang Theory,32,6
42819,Leonard,1, Everything all right?,9,Big Bang Theory,22,3
42820,Penny,1, Yeah. I guess.,9,Big Bang Theory,15,3
42821,Leonard,1, Just tell me.,9,Big Bang Theory,14,3
42822,Penny,1," It's just, when we were kissing, I couldn't help but picture you with that other girl.",9,Big Bang Theory,87,16
42823,Leonard,1," Oh, no. No, come on. I have a friend in you. You said so.",9,Big Bang Theory,58,14
42824,Penny,1, You're right. Just forget it.,9,Big Bang Theory,30,5
42825,Leonard,1," Yeah. Okay, listen. If you're imagining that it was sexy, it wasn't. We, we were both drunk, and she smelled like an ashtray. The boat was moving a lot, so I chipped her tooth.",9,Big Bang Theory,177,34
42826,Penny,1, Did you feel guilty?,9,Big Bang Theory,21,4
42827,Leonard,1," No, she had dental insurance.",9,Big Bang Theory,30,5
42828,Penny,1, Did you feel guilty after kissing her?,9,Big Bang Theory,39,7
42829,Leonard,1, Yes. I felt guilty as soon as it happened. I feel guilty every time I see her.,9,Big Bang Theory,79,17
42830,Penny,1," What do you mean, every time you see her?",9,Big Bang Theory,42,9
42831,Leonard,1," What do I mean? Boy, that's a toughie.",9,Big Bang Theory,39,8
42832,Penny,1, You still see her?,9,Big Bang Theory,19,4
42833,Leonard,1," Well, no, not socially. But, you know, just at work.",9,Big Bang Theory,53,10
42834,Penny,1, You work with her? How could you not tell me that?,9,Big Bang Theory,51,11
42835,Leonard,1," I wanted to tell you in the car, but you told me to stop talking",9,Big Bang Theory,65,15
42836,Penny,1," Oh, okay. So you're saying this is my fault?",9,Big Bang Theory,45,9
42837,Leonard,1," No, of course not. Okay, look, instead of fighting, why don't we dim the lights, um, get naked and make a baby? I was trying to lighten the mood. It's not easy. You try it.",9,Big Bang Theory,173,35
42839,Sheldon,1," Hello, Mother.",9,Big Bang Theory,15,2
42841,Sheldon,1, I just wanted to let you know that you can remove Amy from your nightly prayers. Unless you're open to praying for a beehive to fall on her head.,9,Big Bang Theory,146,29
42843,Sheldon,1, She broke up with me.,9,Big Bang Theory,22,5
42845,Sheldon,1," No, I'll be okay. But I think that I'd like to send the ring back to you.",9,Big Bang Theory,74,17
42847,Sheldon,1, It's over for me. I'm done with women. Like when I swore off Pop Rocks. They both hurt you on purpose.,9,Big Bang Theory,103,21
42849,Sheldon,1, Are you going to say it's all part of God's plan?,9,Big Bang Theory,50,11
42851,Sheldon,1," Then no, thank you.",9,Big Bang Theory,20,4
42853,Sheldon,1, Wasn't Mary Magdalene a woman of ill repute?,9,Big Bang Theory,45,8
42857,Amy,1, Yeah.,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
42858,Howard,1, Everything's gonna be okay.,9,Big Bang Theory,28,4
42860,Amy,1, Thank you.,9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
42863,Amy,1, I just hope I did the right thing.,9,Big Bang Theory,35,8
42865,Amy,1, Like you're doing right now?,9,Big Bang Theory,29,5
42868,Leonard,1, I asked you over and over if you were okay. Why would you go through with the wedding if you weren't?,9,Big Bang Theory,102,21
42869,Penny,1," I thought I was okay, but it turns out I'm not.",9,Big Bang Theory,48,11
42870,Leonard,1," Okay, listen, I may not have been entirely faithful, but you, you are not easy to lift.",9,Big Bang Theory,88,17
42871,Sheldon,1," Wow. Well, marriage must agree with you. Well, you are just glowing.",9,Big Bang Theory,69,12
42872,Leonard,1, I'm not glowing. I'm upset.,9,Big Bang Theory,28,5
42873,Sheldon,1," Well, whatever it is, it agrees with you.",9,Big Bang Theory,42,8
42875,Sheldon,1," Knock, knock, knock, Penny? Knock, knock, knock, Penny? Knock, knock, knock, Penny?",9,Big Bang Theory,84,12
42876,Penny,1, What's this?,9,Big Bang Theory,13,2
42877,Sheldon,1," Leonard told me what happened, so I took it upon myself to make you a hot beverage.",9,Big Bang Theory,84,17
42878,Penny,1, Oh. That's so sweet of you.,9,Big Bang Theory,28,6
42879,Sheldon,1," Yeah. I know. Turns out, being sweet isn't enough to keep a girl these days. I blame Madonna.",9,Big Bang Theory,94,18
42880,Penny,1, I'm sorry to hear about you and Amy.,9,Big Bang Theory,37,8
42881,Sheldon,1," Well, I'm sorry about Leonard. Thought I raised him better than that.",9,Big Bang Theory,70,12
42882,Penny,1," You know, it's bad enough what happened, but then he tried to hide the fact that he sees her all the time at the university.",9,Big Bang Theory,125,25
42883,Sheldon,1, He does? Who is it?,9,Big Bang Theory,20,5
42884,Penny,1, Some girl named Mandy.,9,Big Bang Theory,23,4
42885,Sheldon,1, Mandy Chao?,9,Big Bang Theory,12,2
42886,Penny,1, Yeah.,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
42887,Sheldon,1," Oh, you don't need to worry about her. She's brilliant and attractive. She can do way better",9,Big Bang Theory,93,17
42888,Penny,1, That's great.,9,Big Bang Theory,14,2
42889,Sheldon,1," Wait a minute. I know this may sound far fetched, but I'm on the market now. You know, if I dated Mandy, that would teach both Leonard and Amy a lesson.",9,Big Bang Theory,153,31
42890,Penny,1, That's ridiculous.,9,Big Bang Theory,19,2
42891,Sheldon,1," Oh, you're right. I could never be with a woman whose self-esteem was so low she'd be with Leonard.",9,Big Bang Theory,100,19
42892,Penny,1, I'm with Leonard.,9,Big Bang Theory,18,3
42893,Sheldon,1," Yeah, I know. Forever. Who would have believed these things would happen to us?",9,Big Bang Theory,80,14
42894,Penny,1, Right? I can't believe Amy actually went through with it.,9,Big Bang Theory,58,10
42895,Sheldon,1, Hang on. You knew that she was going to end it with me? Did you try and stop her?,9,Big Bang Theory,82,19
42896,Penny,1, I told her to be true to herself and do what makes her happy.,9,Big Bang Theory,62,14
42897,Sheldon,1, Do what makes her happy? She plays the harp and her car is paid for. How much happier can she be?,9,Big Bang Theory,98,21
42898,Penny,1," Okay, look, it's not my fault that she thought you were a bad boyfriend.",9,Big Bang Theory,73,14
42899,Sheldon,1," I see. Well, I think I'll be going.",9,Big Bang Theory,36,8
42900,Penny,1, Sheldon.,9,Big Bang Theory,9,1
42901,Sheldon,1," No, no, no, no. We are done here. Would you mind opening the door and then angrily slamming it behind me?",9,Big Bang Theory,106,21
42902,Penny,1, Sure.,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
42903,Sheldon,1," Thank you. And slam it hard, because I am pretty steamed.",9,Big Bang Theory,58,11
42905,Howard,1," All right, Leonard, hang in there. Talk to you tomorrow.",9,Big Bang Theory,57,10
42907,Howard,1, I don't know. It's a mess. They had a huge fight in Vegas.,9,Big Bang Theory,59,13
42909,Howard,1, I don't know. Sounds pretty bad. Penny's back in her apartment all by herself.,9,Big Bang Theory,79,14
42912,Sheldon,1, Would you like to hear another reason why men are better than women?,9,Big Bang Theory,69,13
42913,Leonard,1," Sure, let's make it an even hundred.",9,Big Bang Theory,37,7
42914,Sheldon,1, You would never kiss me and make me say I love you and then break up with me.,9,Big Bang Theory,78,18
42915,Leonard,1, I wouldn't.,9,Big Bang Theory,12,2
42916,Sheldon,1, And you know why? â€˜Cause you're a man. The champagne of genders.,9,Big Bang Theory,67,12
42917,Leonard,1," Well, I may be a man, but I think I'm the one that screwed up on this one.",9,Big Bang Theory,75,18
42918,Sheldon,1," Yeah, well, and you admit it, like a man. All you hear women say is, I'll just have a salad. You know? Where's my lip gloss? I think this element should be called radium. That last one was Madame Curie.",9,Big Bang Theory,203,40
42919,Leonard,1, I figured that out.,9,Big Bang Theory,20,4
42920,Sheldon,1, You know what? She was kind of an honorary man. She had a penis made of science.,9,Big Bang Theory,81,17
42921,Leonard,1, Can't believe I'm spending my wedding night with you.,9,Big Bang Theory,54,9
42922,Sheldon,1, Really? I never imagined it any other way.,9,Big Bang Theory,43,8
42924,Sheldon,2, Why are you up?,9,Big Bang Theory,16,4
42925,Leonard,2," How am I supposed to sleep? I've been married less than 24 hours, and my wife isn't speaking to me.",9,Big Bang Theory,100,20
42926,Sheldon,2," Perhaps you can think of this n a more positive light. In one day, you've managed to do what it takes many couples decades to achieve.",9,Big Bang Theory,135,26
42927,Penny,2, Hi.,9,Big Bang Theory,4,1
42928,Leonard,2, Hey.,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
42929,Penny,2, You couldn't sleep either?,9,Big Bang Theory,27,4
42930,Leonard,2, Of course not.,9,Big Bang Theory,15,3
42931,Sheldon,2," Me neither. But I just had a tickle in my throat, not profound marital problems.",9,Big Bang Theory,81,15
42932,Leonard,2, What are we gonna do?,9,Big Bang Theory,22,5
42933,Penny,2, I don't know.,9,Big Bang Theory,14,3
42934,Leonard,2," Please, tell me how I can fix it.",9,Big Bang Theory,34,8
42935,Sheldon,2," Glad you asked. As I see it, there's a simple solution. Your lips had a dalliance with the lips of another woman. It seems only logical that to restore balance to the relationship, you should find another man and dally with him. And by dally, I mean some hardcore mouth-on-mouth action.",9,Big Bang Theory,287,51
42936,Leonard,2," Okay, that is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.",9,Big Bang Theory,51,9
42937,Penny,2," Actually, I think he's onto something.",9,Big Bang Theory,39,6
42938,Leonard,2," You can't be serious. â€˜Cause I messed up and made out with a girl, you're gonna do the same with a random guy?",9,Big Bang Theory,113,23
42939,Sheldon,2, I'm currently single.,9,Big Bang Theory,22,3
42940,Penny,2, That's true. You are.,9,Big Bang Theory,22,4
42941,Leonard,2, What is happening?,9,Big Bang Theory,19,3
42942,Sheldon,2, I will tell you what is happening. I am saving my best friend's marriage.,9,Big Bang Theory,74,14
42943,Leonard,2, U-u-u-uh!,9,Big Bang Theory,10,1
42945,Amy,2," Sheldon, I don't think you understand how being broken up works. The only way I can sort through my feelings is if there is space between us. Every time I see you, it re-traumatizes me. I go through the pain all over again.",9,Big Bang Theory,224,43
42946,Sheldon,2," Well, hello to you, too.",9,Big Bang Theory,25,5
42947,Amy,2, What do you want?,9,Big Bang Theory,18,4
42948,Sheldon,2," I understand we're no longer a couple, but I would like to remind you that we made a baby together.",9,Big Bang Theory,100,20
42949,Amy,2, What baby?,9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
42950,Sheldon,2, A precocious little Internet show known as Fun With Flags.,9,Big Bang Theory,59,10
42951,Amy,2, I'm hanging up.,9,Big Bang Theory,16,3
42952,Sheldon,2, Great. See you in about half an hour.,9,Big Bang Theory,38,8
42953,Amy,2," Sheldon, I am not doing Fun With Flags with you.",9,Big Bang Theory,49,10
42954,Sheldon,2, Why not?,9,Big Bang Theory,9,2
42955,Amy,2, Because we're broken up.,9,Big Bang Theory,25,4
42956,Sheldon,2," Sonny and Cher made it work. Their variety show kept going long after the divorce, and here we are still talking about them.",9,Big Bang Theory,125,23
42957,Amy,2, No one's talking about Sonny and Cher.,9,Big Bang Theory,39,7
42958,Sheldon,2," You must be thinking about Donny and Marie, 'cause you and I are clearly talking about Sonny and Cher.",9,Big Bang Theory,103,19
42959,Amy,2," Sheldon, this has to stop. I know it's hard. It's hard for me, too. But I've seen and talked to you more in the two days we've been broken up than in the last two months that we were together.",9,Big Bang Theory,193,40
42960,Sheldon,2," Well, if you want to see less of me, maybe we should go out again.",9,Big Bang Theory,67,15
42962,Raj,2, I can't believe you made out with Mandy Chao.,9,Big Bang Theory,46,9
42963,Leonard,2," Well, trust me, I wish it never happened.",9,Big Bang Theory,42,8
42964,Raj,2, And you knew about this this whole time?,9,Big Bang Theory,41,8
42965,Howard,2, I did.,9,Big Bang Theory,7,2
42966,Raj,2, And you didn't think to tell me?,9,Big Bang Theory,33,7
42967,Howard,2, Leonard asked me to keep it to myself.,9,Big Bang Theory,39,8
42968,Raj,2, Let's leave Leonard out of this for the moment. This is about you and me.,9,Big Bang Theory,74,15
42969,Leonard,2," Wait, wait, wait, how is my day-old marriage falling apart becoming about you two?",9,Big Bang Theory,83,14
42970,Raj,2, Hang on. What do I need to do to make you trust me?,9,Big Bang Theory,52,13
42971,Howard,2," You think it's hard having one wife, try having two.",9,Big Bang Theory,53,10
42972,Raj,2, I bet you told Bernadette all about how he was screwing around with Mandy Chao.,9,Big Bang Theory,80,15
42973,Leonard,2," Oh, we didn't screw around. We just got drunk and made out.",9,Big Bang Theory,60,12
42974,Raj,2, Whatever. It would have been nice to hear it from you.,9,Big Bang Theory,55,11
42976,Amy,2, What are you doing here?,9,Big Bang Theory,25,5
42977,Sheldon,2, I'm here to return your belongings. That's what people who've broken up do.,9,Big Bang Theory,76,13
42978,Amy,2, And you didn't do your compulsive knocking ritual so I would open the door.,9,Big Bang Theory,76,14
42979,Sheldon,2," On the contrary, you no longer get to enjoy my charming eccentricities. We're not friends with benefits.",9,Big Bang Theory,105,17
42980,Amy,2, Just give me the box.,9,Big Bang Theory,22,5
42981,Sheldon,2, Wait. Don't you want to go through it to make sure I haven't forgotten anything?,9,Big Bang Theory,81,15
42982,Amy,2, Fine. My old scarf.,9,Big Bang Theory,20,4
42983,Sheldon,2, You wore it the night we went ice-skating. Remember?,9,Big Bang Theory,53,9
42984,Amy,2," You mean the night that I went ice-skating, and you stood at the rail googling the symptoms of hypothermia?",9,Big Bang Theory,108,19
42985,Sheldon,2," We made one heck of a team, huh?",9,Big Bang Theory,33,8
42986,Amy,2, Whose bra is this?,9,Big Bang Theory,19,4
42987,Sheldon,2," It's not yours? Oh, my. How embarrassing for both of us.",9,Big Bang Theory,57,11
42988,Amy,2, It's Penny's.,9,Big Bang Theory,14,2
42989,Sheldon,2," Hey, you broke up with me. It is none of your business whose naked bosom I'm smooshing around like pizza dough.",9,Big Bang Theory,112,21
42990,Amy,2, Good-bye.,9,Big Bang Theory,10,1
42991,Sheldon,2,"  Amy.  Amy.  Amy. Hmm. Tables work, too. Good to know.",9,Big Bang Theory,55,10
42993,Howard,2," Ooh, brownies for girls' night!",9,Big Bang Theory,32,5
42995,Howard,2," Look, I know it's a lot of money, but the guy at the store said in five to seven years, it'll pay for itself.",9,Big Bang Theory,110,24
42997,Howard,2, Doesn't matter. What are you mad about?,9,Big Bang Theory,40,7
42999,Howard,2," And you have every right to be mad about those things. So, why don't you let me handle the credit card bill this month, huh? I mean, don't even look at it.",9,Big Bang Theory,156,32
43001,Howard,2, And I wish Leonard never told me. He's the bad guy here.,9,Big Bang Theory,57,12
43003,Howard,2," And you let Penny marry him. Compared to that, who cares if I bought a George Clooney limited edition manscaping kit?",9,Big Bang Theory,118,21
43005,Leonard,2," Hi. I'm calling about your marriage counselling services and was curious what your rate is. Really? Um, okay. Is there any kind of discount for length of marriage? â€˜Cause we're just talking hours here.",9,Big Bang Theory,204,34
43006,Penny,2, Hi.,9,Big Bang Theory,4,1
43007,Leonard,2, Call you back. Hey.,9,Big Bang Theory,20,4
43008,Penny,2, Can we talk?,9,Big Bang Theory,13,3
43009,Leonard,2, I would love that.,9,Big Bang Theory,19,4
43010,Penny,2," All right, look, I'm sorry I said I was okay with everything before we got married. I hate that we're going through this, but I don't know what to do.",9,Big Bang Theory,151,30
43011,Leonard,2," If you don't mind waiting for a Groupon, we can try marriage counselling.",9,Big Bang Theory,74,13
43012,Sheldon,2, Hello.,9,Big Bang Theory,7,1
43013,Leonard,2," Hey, uh, buddy, can we have some privacy?",9,Big Bang Theory,42,8
43014,Sheldon,2," Oh, of course. Wouldn't want to intrude. This is yours.",9,Big Bang Theory,56,10
43015,Penny,2," Okay, when I'm done with him, I'm gonna need more information.",9,Big Bang Theory,63,11
43016,Sheldon,2, Nothing odd. I just wanted to rub Amy's nose in it.,9,Big Bang Theory,52,11
43017,Penny,2," Okay, look, I might be overreacting, but how am I supposed to get past this when I know tomorrow you're gonna go to work and see this woman?",9,Big Bang Theory,141,28
43018,Sheldon,2," Now, forgive me for eavesdropping, but as I see it, there's a simple solution.",9,Big Bang Theory,79,14
43019,Leonard,2," Wake up, wake up, wake up.",9,Big Bang Theory,27,6
43020,Sheldon,2, Bring Penny to meet Mandy.,9,Big Bang Theory,27,5
43021,Leonard,2, What? Why?,9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
43022,Sheldon,2," Well, right now, Penny's imagination is running wild, but if they meet, that will eliminate the mystery and alleviate her fears. Like when that Sparkletts guy let me look under his eye patch.",9,Big Bang Theory,192,33
43023,Leonard,2," Uh, first of all, you made that guy cry.",9,Big Bang Theory,41,9
43024,Sheldon,2, And we learned that you don't need an eyeball to do that.,9,Big Bang Theory,58,12
43025,Leonard,2," Secondly, I can't think of a more horrible idea than Penny meeting Mandy.",9,Big Bang Theory,74,13
43026,Penny,2, Really? Why is that?,9,Big Bang Theory,21,4
43027,Leonard,2," What, you actually want to meet her?",9,Big Bang Theory,37,7
43028,Penny,2," No, but now that you're being weird about it, maybe I should.",9,Big Bang Theory,62,12
43029,Leonard,2, I'm not being weird. Am I being weird?,9,Big Bang Theory,39,8
43030,Sheldon,2, Yes. And that's coming from me.,9,Big Bang Theory,32,6
43031,Leonard,2," Fine, you want to meet her?",9,Big Bang Theory,28,6
43032,Penny,2," No, I just want to know that when you're at work, there's nothing going on.",9,Big Bang Theory,76,15
43033,Leonard,2, How many times do I have to tell you? I have no interest in this woman.,9,Big Bang Theory,72,16
43034,Penny,2," Yeah, well, maybe she has interest in you.",9,Big Bang Theory,43,8
43035,Sheldon,2," In Leonard? Oh, even the Sparkletts guy could see that's unlikely.",9,Big Bang Theory,67,11
43037,Penny,2, I guess my big problem is I never saw Leonard as the kind of guy who would do something like this.,9,Big Bang Theory,99,21
43038,Amy,2, Anybody can make a mistake in a weak moment.,9,Big Bang Theory,45,9
43039,Penny,2, What do you think?,9,Big Bang Theory,19,4
43041,Penny,2," You know, I fell in love with Leonard because he wasn't anything like the guys I was used to dating. I mean, I knew those guys weren't above cheating because that's usually how we met.",9,Big Bang Theory,185,35
43042,Amy,2," Come on, you know Leonard's not like that.",9,Big Bang Theory,43,8
43043,Penny,2, I want to believe you. I really do. Am I being naive?,9,Big Bang Theory,54,12
43045,Penny,2," You know, he never would've done this when we first met. He's cockier now.",9,Big Bang Theory,75,14
43046,Amy,2, That's because you made him more confident.,9,Big Bang Theory,44,7
43048,Penny,2, I never thought about it like that.,9,Big Bang Theory,36,7
43052,Leonard,2, You guys have any idea how much it costs to see a marriage counsellor?,9,Big Bang Theory,71,14
43053,Howard,2, 250 dollars an hour. Why?,9,Big Bang Theory,26,5
43054,Raj,2, How do you know?,9,Big Bang Theory,17,4
43055,Howard,2," Bernadette and I have occasionally gone to one to, you know, stay on top of things.",9,Big Bang Theory,84,16
43056,Raj,2, And I'm just hearing about this now?,9,Big Bang Theory,37,7
43057,Howard,2," Dude, just because we're best friends doesn't mean that I have to tell you everything that goes on.",9,Big Bang Theory,100,18
43058,Raj,2," You don't have to, you should want to.",9,Big Bang Theory,39,8
43059,Leonard,2," Oh, great, there's Mandy.",9,Big Bang Theory,26,4
43060,Howard,2, Why are marine biologists always so cute?,9,Big Bang Theory,42,7
43061,Raj,2," I don't know, but I'd like to get lost in her Bermuda Triangle.",9,Big Bang Theory,64,13
43062,Leonard,2, That's not helpful.,9,Big Bang Theory,20,3
43063,Howard,2, Then I won't say I'd like to cover three-quarters of her surface area.,9,Big Bang Theory,71,13
43064,Leonard,2, Are we done?,9,Big Bang Theory,13,3
43065,Raj,2," Not yet, this is fun. Ooh, I know. I'd let her free my willy. Where you going?",9,Big Bang Theory,79,17
43066,Leonard,2," I'm gonna ask her if she'd be willing to talk to Penny, tell her she has nothing to worry about.",9,Big Bang Theory,97,20
43067,Howard,2," Leonard, wait.",9,Big Bang Theory,15,2
43068,Leonard,2, What?,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
43069,Howard,2, I'd like to SpongeBob her SquarePants.,9,Big Bang Theory,39,6
43070,Raj,2, Now we are done.,9,Big Bang Theory,17,4
43071,Leonard,2, Hey.,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
43073,Leonard,2," Uh, do you mind if I sit?",9,Big Bang Theory,26,7
43075,Leonard,2," So, um, I've been thinking a lot about you and me and the boat.",9,Big Bang Theory,64,14
43077,Leonard,2," You know, what we did, when we were drunk.",9,Big Bang Theory,43,9
43079,Leonard,2," No, we just made out.",9,Big Bang Theory,22,5
43081,Leonard,2," Uh, okay, well, um, I got married recently.",9,Big Bang Theory,44,8
43083,Leonard,2," Never gets old. No, no, to a girl. Anyway, I told her what happened between you and me, and she's concerned about us seeing each other at work.",9,Big Bang Theory,144,28
43085,Leonard,2, Because I didn't want there to be any secrets between us.,9,Big Bang Theory,58,11
43087,Leonard,2, What else would it be?,9,Big Bang Theory,23,5
43089,Leonard,2," No, I don't think so. Although, Penny did say exactly that.",9,Big Bang Theory,60,11
43091,Leonard,2," You know, on some level, I've always believed that I don't deserve a woman like her.",9,Big Bang Theory,85,16
43093,Leonard,2," I mean, she's really beautiful. She could have any guy she wants. Which is probably why it took her so many years to tell me she loved me.",9,Big Bang Theory,139,28
43095,Leonard,2," Too expensive. You'd think I'd be used to women withholding their love. I mean, my mother did. I mean, no matter how hard I tried, she just didn't have any interest in me.",9,Big Bang Theory,172,33
43097,Leonard,2," I wonder if that's why I have such a dysfunctional relationship with Sheldon. I had a dream the other night that I was in a cave and I was nursing a baby, but the baby had Sheldon's head on it.",9,Big Bang Theory,194,40
43099,Raj,2," Hey, Leonard, when you're done, we came up with a bunch more.",9,Big Bang Theory,62,12
43101,Sheldon,2," And then the Czech Republic says to Slovakia, I don't think you understand how being broken up works. Can you believe that? You'd think that the Czech Republic would try to hold on to what it had, given that it's not as young as it used to be. And I don't see any other countries lining up to invade its southern borders.",9,Big Bang Theory,322,62
43102,Amy,2, I'm gonna kill him.,9,Big Bang Theory,20,4
43103,Sheldon,2," But enough about the Czech Republic. Let's talk about the time Moldova made Romania a birthday cake and Romania said it tasted good even though it didn't. And yet Romania gets dumped. I'll pause here while you mull that one over. I know, right?",9,Big Bang Theory,245,44
43105,Penny,2," So, you said you had something to tell me.",9,Big Bang Theory,43,9
43106,Leonard,2," Okay, yeah, um, do you remember when you accused me of trying to sabotage our wedding?",9,Big Bang Theory,87,16
43107,Penny,2, Uh-huh.,9,Big Bang Theory,8,1
43108,Leonard,2," I've been thinking about it, and you might be right. But the good news is that I'm pretty sure I know why.",9,Big Bang Theory,107,22
43109,Penny,2, I'm listening.,9,Big Bang Theory,15,2
43110,Leonard,2," Penny, after all these years, I still feel like maybe I don't deserve you.",9,Big Bang Theory,75,14
43111,Penny,2," Okay, that is the lamest excuse you could've possibly come up with. But I get it.",9,Big Bang Theory,82,16
43112,Leonard,2, You do?,9,Big Bang Theory,8,2
43113,Penny,2," Yeah. Yeah, sometimes I worry you're gonna wake up and leave me for someone more like you.",9,Big Bang Theory,91,17
43114,Leonard,2, I don't even understand why you're with someone like me. Why would I want to be with someone like me?,9,Big Bang Theory,102,20
43115,Penny,2," You know what I mean. And, you know, maybe the way I've been reacting was me sabotaging this, too.",9,Big Bang Theory,99,19
43116,Leonard,2," Well, how about we stop being so scared of losing each other and just be together?",9,Big Bang Theory,83,16
43117,Penny,2, That sounds nice.,9,Big Bang Theory,18,3
43118,Leonard,2," Good. Because I've loved you since the moment we met, and I will keep loving you until the end of time.",9,Big Bang Theory,104,21
43119,Penny,2," Oh. Oh, my God, that is the most beautiful thing anyone's ever said to me.",9,Big Bang Theory,75,15
43120,Leonard,2," Yeah? That's because you're beautiful, and your beauty fills my heart with love and song.",9,Big Bang Theory,90,15
43121,Penny,2," It's getting kind of cheesy, Leonard.",9,Big Bang Theory,38,6
43122,Leonard,2," Huh? If you think that's cheesy, buckle up. Penny Hofstadter, will you please stay married to me?",9,Big Bang Theory,98,17
43123,Penny,2," Oh, damn it, you topped it. Should we go to the bedroom and make this marriage official?",9,Big Bang Theory,89,17
43124,Leonard,2," Yes, please.",9,Big Bang Theory,13,2
43125,Penny,2, Okay.,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
43127,Penny,2," Sheldon, I can't believe you got us a wedding gift.",9,Big Bang Theory,52,10
43128,Sheldon,2," I don't know why you're so surprised. I watch movies, I see what people do.",9,Big Bang Theory,76,15
43129,Leonard,2, What is this?,9,Big Bang Theory,14,3
43130,Sheldon,2, Plane tickets and hotel reservations for a weekend away in San Francisco.,9,Big Bang Theory,74,12
43131,Penny,2, Oh.,9,Big Bang Theory,4,1
43132,Leonard,2, Wow.,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
43133,Penny,2, That's so great.,9,Big Bang Theory,17,3
43134,Sheldon,2," Yeah, there's Fisherman's Wharf and Alcatraz and cable cars. We're gonna have so much fun.",9,Big Bang Theory,91,15
43135,Penny,2, We?,9,Big Bang Theory,4,1
43136,Sheldon,2, Is there a problem?,9,Big Bang Theory,20,4
43137,Penny,2," Oh, no, no, I just, I said, Whee.",9,Big Bang Theory,34,8
43138,Amy,2, How dare you go on the Internet and say mean things about me and compare my genitalia to part of Czechoslovakia?,9,Big Bang Theory,113,21
43139,Sheldon,2," You saw through that one, did you?",9,Big Bang Theory,35,7
43140,Amy,2," I don't know what you were thinking, but take the video down now.",9,Big Bang Theory,66,13
43141,Sheldon,2, She watched it. I'm gonna get that girl back.,9,Big Bang Theory,46,9
43142,Amy,2, I only watched it because you e-mailed it to me with the subject line this is gonna make you mad.,9,Big Bang Theory,98,20
43143,Sheldon,2, She was listening through the door. She wants me.,9,Big Bang Theory,50,9
43145,Sheldon,3, Would you pass the mustard?,9,Big Bang Theory,28,5
43146,Leonard,3," Sure. Hey, want to hear a fun fact about mustard?",9,Big Bang Theory,50,10
43147,Sheldon,3, Is it that the glucosinolates which give mustard its flavour were evolved by the cabbage family as a chemical defence against caterpillars?,9,Big Bang Theory,140,22
43148,Leonard,3, Yeah.,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
43149,Sheldon,3," Well, that was fun. Good for you, Leonard.",9,Big Bang Theory,43,8
43150,Raj,3," Hey, there.",9,Big Bang Theory,12,2
43151,Leonard,3," Hey, you're early. The movie doesn't start for an hour.",9,Big Bang Theory,56,10
43152,Howard,3," Actually, we're not going to the movies. We are here to kidnap you.",9,Big Bang Theory,68,13
43153,Leonard,3, What are you talking about?,9,Big Bang Theory,28,5
43154,Raj,3," Well, you eloped and we didn't get a chance to throw you a bachelor party, so there's a van downstairs and we're here to take you to a surprise location for the weekend.",9,Big Bang Theory,170,33
43155,Sheldon,3," Well, I'd hardly call this kidnapping. Where's the blindfold? Where's the duct tape? Where's the part where you call me and demand ransom and I try to keep you on the phone, but you hang up seconds before I can trace it and then I say I'm getting too old for this crud?",9,Big Bang Theory,270,53
43156,Leonard,3, When do we leave?,9,Big Bang Theory,18,4
43157,Howard,3, Right now.,9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
43158,Raj,3," Yeah, Penny packed you a bag.",9,Big Bang Theory,30,6
43159,Howard,3," Wow, okay.",9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
43160,Sheldon,3, You're seriously going to get in a van and let these two take you to an unknown destination for an entire weekend?,9,Big Bang Theory,115,22
43161,Raj,3," Oh, not just him, you're coming, too.",9,Big Bang Theory,38,7
43162,Sheldon,3," Oh, and how do you think you're going to get me to do that?",9,Big Bang Theory,60,14
43164,Sheldon,3, Unhand me. This is ridiculous.,9,Big Bang Theory,31,5
43165,Howard,3, I told you to put tape on his mouth.,9,Big Bang Theory,37,9
43166,Raj,3, And I told you he bit me.,9,Big Bang Theory,26,7
43168,Sheldon,3, It's bad enough I'm being taken against my will. I don't see why it has to be in some hippie's mobile sex dungeon.,9,Big Bang Theory,115,23
43169,Howard,3," Well, Sheldon, there's something about this van that you're going to find very interesting.",9,Big Bang Theory,92,14
43170,Sheldon,3, It runs on syphilis?,9,Big Bang Theory,21,4
43171,Raj,3," This van was owned and driven by your personal physics hero, Richard Feynman.",9,Big Bang Theory,78,13
43172,Sheldon,3, No.,9,Big Bang Theory,4,1
43173,Howard,3, Yeah. A buddy of mine let me borrow it.,9,Big Bang Theory,40,9
43174,Leonard,3, This was Feynman's van? That's so cool.,9,Big Bang Theory,40,7
43175,Raj,3," Yeah, nothing's been changed since he drove it.",9,Big Bang Theory,48,8
43176,Howard,3, I bet he picked up a lot of cute grad students in this bad boy.,9,Big Bang Theory,64,15
43177,Sheldon,3," Yeah, and talked about physics with them.",9,Big Bang Theory,42,7
43178,Leonard,3," So, are you gonna give us a clue where we're headed?",9,Big Bang Theory,53,11
43179,Raj,3," Uh, okay, let's see. They've got spicy food and there's a chance you'll get diarrhoea.",9,Big Bang Theory,87,15
43180,Leonard,3, India.,9,Big Bang Theory,7,1
43181,Raj,3, We can drive there.,9,Big Bang Theory,20,4
43182,Leonard,3, Your house?,9,Big Bang Theory,12,2
43183,Howard,3, We are going to Me-hi-co.,9,Big Bang Theory,26,5
43184,Leonard,3," Fun, I've never been there.",9,Big Bang Theory,28,5
43185,Sheldon,3," Leonard, don't be fooled. I'm from Texas, Me-hi-co is Spanish for Mexico.",9,Big Bang Theory,74,12
43186,Raj,3, What's wrong with Mexico?,9,Big Bang Theory,26,4
43187,Sheldon,3," Uh, mariachi bands, wild dogs, beans that jump around 'cause there's a worm inside.",9,Big Bang Theory,84,14
43188,Howard,3," Okay, calm down. There's a theme to this weekend. We are going to Mexico in Feynman's van to stay at the vacation house Feynman bought with the money from his Nobel Prize.",9,Big Bang Theory,172,32
43189,Sheldon,3, Viva la Imodium. Ay-ay-ay.,9,Big Bang Theory,27,4
43192,Penny,3," Nah, if I want to see a naked dancing man, I just flush the toilet while Leonard's in the shower.",9,Big Bang Theory,98,20
43193,Amy,3, Hi.,9,Big Bang Theory,4,1
43194,Penny,3, Hey.,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
43195,Amy,3," I know we're not making a fuss, but in the spirit of bachelorette parties, I made cookies in the shape of male genitals.",9,Big Bang Theory,121,23
43196,Penny,3," You really didn't have to, whoa! That is anatomic.",9,Big Bang Theory,51,9
43197,Amy,3, Thank you. The veins are gummy worms.,9,Big Bang Theory,38,7
43199,Amy,3, I had extra dough.,9,Big Bang Theory,19,4
43200,Penny,3," Oh, that's Leonard. He said they're about to cross the border.",9,Big Bang Theory,63,11
43202,Penny,3," Oh, yeah, right. Lock up your daughters or Sheldon might lecture them about the North American Free Trade Agreement.",9,Big Bang Theory,117,19
43203,Amy,3," Boy, that was a long night for me.",9,Big Bang Theory,35,8
43205,Sheldon,3," Uh-oh. According to this Mexican customs website, visitors may not bring more than five laser discs, 20 compact discs or 12 VHS tapes.",9,Big Bang Theory,135,23
43206,Raj,3, We don't have any of those.,9,Big Bang Theory,28,6
43207,Sheldon,3," How can you be sure? VHS was king when Feynman drove this van. For all we know, there are hidden compartments lousy with Jane Fonda workout videos.",9,Big Bang Theory,148,27
43208,Leonard,3," If there was a hidden compartment, don't you think you'd be stuffed in it by now?",9,Big Bang Theory,82,16
43209,Sheldon,3, Are we all up to date on our yellow fever inoculations?,9,Big Bang Theory,56,11
43210,Howard,3, You don't need a yellow fever shot to go to Mexico.,9,Big Bang Theory,52,11
43211,Sheldon,3, You can never be too careful. I got one last year before I went to Epcot.,9,Big Bang Theory,74,16
43213,Amy,3," So, Penny, how's married life?",9,Big Bang Theory,31,5
43214,Penny,3," Oh, it's good. I just wish Leonard would work up the courage to tell Sheldon he's moving in here.",9,Big Bang Theory,98,19
43216,Penny,3," We are. I mean, he sleeps here. But it's only a matter of time before Sheldon has a bad dream and tries to climb into bed with the Leonard-shaped pile of pillows.",9,Big Bang Theory,163,32
43218,Amy,3," Fine, I guess. I've been focusing on me. I was thinking about changing my wardrobe.",9,Big Bang Theory,84,15
43219,Penny,3, Yes.,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
43221,Amy,3, But then I decided I don't want to go changing who I am just because of some man.,9,Big Bang Theory,82,18
43222,Penny,3, Yes.,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
43224,Penny,3," You know, it is normal to want to change your look after a breakup.",9,Big Bang Theory,68,14
43225,Amy,3," Actually, I was thinking of making one small change.",9,Big Bang Theory,53,9
43227,Penny,3, Your glasses?,9,Big Bang Theory,14,2
43229,Penny,3, Your shoes.,9,Big Bang Theory,12,2
43230,Amy,3, Piercing my ears.,9,Big Bang Theory,18,3
43231,Penny,3, Oh.,9,Big Bang Theory,4,1
43233,Amy,3," My mom said pierced ears were for whores, pirates and genies.",9,Big Bang Theory,62,11
43234,Penny,3," Okay, well, you're a grown woman now.",9,Big Bang Theory,38,7
43235,Amy,3," I know, but Sheldon had this clause in the Relationship Agreement forbidding cosmetic surgery unless it's to look like a Klingon.",9,Big Bang Theory,130,21
43237,Penny,3, Why? I can do it right here.,9,Big Bang Theory,29,7
43238,Amy,3, Really? You have a piercing gun?,9,Big Bang Theory,33,6
43239,Penny,3," No. All you need is a needle and an ice cube. I've done it, like, a dozen times.",9,Big Bang Theory,81,18
43240,Amy,3," Oh, I don't know.",9,Big Bang Theory,18,4
43241,Penny,3," Oh, come on. I'll be gentle. Let me take your ear virginity.",9,Big Bang Theory,61,12
43244,Leonard,3," Hey, watch your speed. I hear the Mexican police target tourists.",9,Big Bang Theory,66,11
43245,Howard,3," Oh, not a problem. If anything goes down, we just put Koothrappali in the driver's seat and slap a sombrero on his head.",9,Big Bang Theory,121,23
43246,Raj,3," Dude, how many races can you offend in a single breath?",9,Big Bang Theory,56,11
43247,Howard,3, I don't know. Have you watched the Olympics with me?,9,Big Bang Theory,53,10
43248,Leonard,3," Sheldon, can you believe that we're driving in a van that was owned by one of the greatest scientific minds of the 20th century? It's like the Batmobile. If Batman was real and a physicist and his car wasn't cool.",9,Big Bang Theory,214,40
43249,Sheldon,3, It is extraordinary.,9,Big Bang Theory,21,3
43250,Raj,3," Perhaps some of his mojo will rub off on us. Maybe between this and his beach house, we will be inspired to greatness.",9,Big Bang Theory,119,23
43251,Sheldon,3," I usually don't put too much stock in charms and talismans. However, even I must admit feeling Richard Feynman's butt dent cupping my own bottom that does get the creative juices flowing.",9,Big Bang Theory,188,32
43252,Howard,3," Hey, I have to return this van. Keep your creative juices in your pants.",9,Big Bang Theory,73,14
43253,Sheldon,3, What was that?,9,Big Bang Theory,15,3
43254,Howard,3, I think it's a tyre.,9,Big Bang Theory,21,5
43255,Sheldon,3, What if it's banditos shooting at us? What if we get kidnapped? What if we end up in a factory making Bart Simpson piÃ±atas for the rest of our lives?,9,Big Bang Theory,151,30
43256,Howard,3, It's the tyre.,9,Big Bang Theory,15,3
43257,Sheldon,3, Leonard?,9,Big Bang Theory,9,1
43258,Leonard,3, What?,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
43259,Sheldon,3, I am getting too old for this crud.,9,Big Bang Theory,36,8
43262,Amy,3," You're right. I should probably let all of my Facebook friends know. Penny, I'm no longer in a relationship.",9,Big Bang Theory,109,19
43264,Penny,3," Uh, no, not yet. There's still a few people I haven't told personally.",9,Big Bang Theory,71,13
43265,Amy,3, Who?,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
43266,Penny,3," Oh, just my parents and my entire family.",9,Big Bang Theory,42,8
43268,Amy,3, Why?,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
43269,Penny,3," Well, I don't want to hurt my dad. You know, he always wanted to dance with his daughter at her wedding.",9,Big Bang Theory,105,21
43271,Penny,3," They started to, then her water broke. You know, if he finds out we eloped, it's gonna break his heart.",9,Big Bang Theory,104,20
43272,Amy,3, How long do you think you can keep it from him?,9,Big Bang Theory,48,11
43274,Penny,3," Well, not necessarily. You know, Dad's not getting any younger, so if I wait long enough, I'll just tell him he walked me down the aisle and it was magical.",9,Big Bang Theory,157,30
43276,Raj,3, When did you learn how to change a tyre?,9,Big Bang Theory,41,9
43277,Howard,3, Every self-respecting gentleman should know how in case he comes across a damsel in distress by the side of the road.,9,Big Bang Theory,118,21
43278,Sheldon,3," If I see one scorpion, I am getting on someone's shoulders and never coming down.",9,Big Bang Theory,82,15
43279,Leonard,3, And there's your damsel.,9,Big Bang Theory,25,4
43280,Howard,3," Wow, this one's really stuck.",9,Big Bang Theory,30,5
43281,Raj,3, Are you turning it the right way?,9,Big Bang Theory,34,7
43282,Howard,3," No. I took the other four off and when I got to this one, I thought, you know, I'm in a rut, let's shake things up.",9,Big Bang Theory,116,26
43283,Raj,3," Here, let me try. You're right, it doesn't turn the other way.",9,Big Bang Theory,63,12
43285,Penny,3, There you go. You're all done.,9,Big Bang Theory,31,6
43286,Amy,3," That wasn't so bad. Nice. Boy, if my mom could see me now, she'd lock me in the sin closet.",9,Big Bang Theory,92,20
43288,Amy,3," Actually, the joke was on her. I could still see the TV through the slats.",9,Big Bang Theory,75,15
43289,Penny,3, I'm starting to see why you and your mom aren't very close.,9,Big Bang Theory,60,12
43291,Penny,3," You're not gonna let this go, are you?",9,Big Bang Theory,39,8
43292,Amy,3," Well, it's kind of sad that they don't know. I mean, they love Leonard.",9,Big Bang Theory,72,14
43293,Penny,3," Fine, you want me to call? I'll call. Why am I so nervous?",9,Big Bang Theory,59,13
43295,Penny,3, Yeah? How did it go? Did she make you crawl into the breaking-up drawer?,9,Big Bang Theory,73,14
43296,Amy,3," Uh, well, actually, to be honest, I haven't told her yet.",9,Big Bang Theory,58,11
43297,Penny,3, You've been giving me a hard time and you haven't even told your mom about Sheldon?,9,Big Bang Theory,84,16
43298,Amy,3, I'm feeling a little dizzy from all the blood loss. I don't know what you're talking about.,9,Big Bang Theory,92,17
43299,Penny,3," Fine. I'm calling home, but when I'm done, you're calling your mother.",9,Big Bang Theory,71,12
43300,Amy,3, Easy for you to say. You never had to watch 60 Minutes like this.,9,Big Bang Theory,66,14
43301,Penny,3," Hey, Daddy.",9,Big Bang Theory,12,2
43303,Penny,3," Uh, good. Is Mom around?",9,Big Bang Theory,25,5
43305,Penny,3," Okay, I'll talk to her later. Uh, Dad, there's something I need to tell you. Leonard and I got married.",9,Big Bang Theory,104,20
43307,Penny,3," Last week. I'm sorry, I should've told you. It was a spur of the moment thing. I feel terrible. Please don't be too disappointed.",9,Big Bang Theory,130,24
43309,Penny,3, Very. Leonard is so great.,9,Big Bang Theory,27,5
43311,Penny,3," Aw, thank you, Daddy. That means so much.",9,Big Bang Theory,42,8
43313,Penny,3, It is. You're the best dad ever.,9,Big Bang Theory,33,7
43315,Penny,3," Well, what is it?",9,Big Bang Theory,18,4
43317,Penny,3, No.,9,Big Bang Theory,4,1
43319,Penny,3, Moondance?,9,Big Bang Theory,11,1
43321,Penny,3, You killed my pig?,9,Big Bang Theory,19,4
43323,Penny,3, When?,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
43325,Penny,3, You didn't tell me for a year?,9,Big Bang Theory,31,7
43329,Howard,3, What are you doing?,9,Big Bang Theory,20,4
43330,Raj,3, It's called Lamaze breathing. It helps you push.,9,Big Bang Theory,49,8
43331,Howard,3, Great. He's pushing with his uterus.,9,Big Bang Theory,37,6
43332,Raj,3, There's got to be a smarter way of removing it.,9,Big Bang Theory,48,10
43333,Leonard,3," Yeah, this is nothing more than a physics problem.",9,Big Bang Theory,51,9
43334,Sheldon,3," Right. Archimedes once said give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world.",9,Big Bang Theory,120,24
43335,Raj,3, Of course. All we need is to find stuff to make a lever big enough to fix this.,9,Big Bang Theory,80,18
43336,Howard,3, Exactly. I'll bet there's something around here that could be a lever.,9,Big Bang Theory,71,12
43337,Leonard,3," Let's see, a lever, a lever.",9,Big Bang Theory,29,6
43338,Sheldon,3," Everybody hold on. Let's take this problem one step at a time. First, we need to decide whether we're calling it leever or lehver. And the sooner we decide it's leever, the sooner we can roll up our sleeves, not slehves, and get to work.",9,Big Bang Theory,238,45
43339,Leonard,3, We're gonna be here foreever.,9,Big Bang Theory,30,5
43341,Penny,3," Thanks a lot, guys.",9,Big Bang Theory,20,4
43343,Penny,3," Before I made that call, my pig was alive and happy and rolling around in the mud. Now he's illegally buried in our backyard next to my great-grandmother.",9,Big Bang Theory,155,28
43345,Penny,3, No. He was a beloved member of the family.,9,Big Bang Theory,43,9
43347,Penny,3, It's not funny. You're up. Call your mother.,9,Big Bang Theory,45,8
43348,Amy,3," Oh, maybe later. Your pig dying made me sad. And a little hungry.",9,Big Bang Theory,66,13
43349,Penny,3," Phone, now.",9,Big Bang Theory,12,2
43350,Amy,3," Okay. Okay. Fine. Hi, Mom.",9,Big Bang Theory,27,5
43351,Penny,3, Try dialing.,9,Big Bang Theory,13,2
43352,Amy,3," You saw that, huh? Hi, Mom. How are you doing? Oh, good. How's work? That's nice. I'm fine. Hey, listen, I've been meaning to ask, how come Aunt Doe and Aunt Florence never got along?",9,Big Bang Theory,184,35
43353,Penny,3," Okay, just give me that. Amy broke up with Sheldon, she got her ears pierced and she made us eat penis cookies. Hang on. She wants to talk to you.",9,Big Bang Theory,147,30
43355,Leonard,3, I don't think the lever's working.,9,Big Bang Theory,35,6
43356,Howard,3, What makes you say that?,9,Big Bang Theory,25,5
43357,Leonard,3, There's gotta be something else we could try.,9,Big Bang Theory,46,8
43358,Raj,3," If this was Star Trek, we could use a phaser to blast it off.",9,Big Bang Theory,62,14
43359,Howard,3," No, it's too broad of a beam. You'd need something more precise, like Superman's heat vision.",9,Big Bang Theory,94,16
43360,Sheldon,3," Ooh, the Green Lantern's ring could make a big green hand that unscrews it.",9,Big Bang Theory,76,14
43361,Raj,3," If you need a green hand, why not just use the Hulk?",9,Big Bang Theory,53,12
43362,Sheldon,3," Oh, please, the Hulk would never get across the border with that temper.",9,Big Bang Theory,73,13
43363,Leonard,3," Guys, excuse me, not that calling one of the Avengers isn't a perfectly reasonable choice, but we're scientists. Don't you think we can figure this out using actual science?",9,Big Bang Theory,174,29
43364,Sheldon,3," Yes, we could use science. But it's your bachelor party. Lighten up.",9,Big Bang Theory,69,12
43365,Howard,3," We will, we will percussive shock you.",9,Big Bang Theory,39,7
43367,Sheldon,3," Buddy you're a boy, make a big noise playin' in the street, gonna be a big man someday. You got mud on your face, you big disgrace, kickin' your can all over the place. I have an eidetic memory. Sometimes it's a curse.",9,Big Bang Theory,219,43
43368,Raj,3, I had no idea tortilla chips were such a good fuel source.,9,Big Bang Theory,59,12
43369,Leonard,3, They're basically pure hydrocarbons soaked in fat. Let's hope the lug nut expands.,9,Big Bang Theory,83,13
43370,Sheldon,3, What if that burning food attracts animals?,9,Big Bang Theory,44,7
43371,Howard,3, We have plenty of food for the animals.,9,Big Bang Theory,40,8
43372,Sheldon,3, We do?,9,Big Bang Theory,7,2
43373,Howard,3, Yep. A six-foot wiener in a Flash T-shirt.,9,Big Bang Theory,43,8
43374,Sheldon,3, That's not very nice.,9,Big Bang Theory,22,4
43375,Leonard,3, It's a bachelor party. Lighten up.,9,Big Bang Theory,35,6
43376,Sheldon,3, What is that awful smell?,9,Big Bang Theory,26,5
43377,Howard,3, It's burning salsa. I'm hoping the acidity and salinity combined with electricity will corrode the lug nut off.,9,Big Bang Theory,112,18
43378,Sheldon,3, What an innovative solution. Perhaps I don't give your MIT education enough credit.,9,Big Bang Theory,84,13
43379,Howard,3," Yeah, I saw it on Mythbusters.",9,Big Bang Theory,31,6
43380,Sheldon,3," All right, this rust, combined with the aluminium recovered from the van, is now thermite.",9,Big Bang Theory,91,15
43381,Howard,3, Great. Couple of pinches ought to do the trick.,9,Big Bang Theory,48,9
43382,Raj,3, Is that enough to melt the lug nut?,9,Big Bang Theory,36,8
43383,Leonard,3," Well, let's start small. We can always add more.",9,Big Bang Theory,49,9
43384,Howard,3," You put up a good fight, lug nut, but you've met your match.",9,Big Bang Theory,61,13
43386,Raj,3," Hey, look, the lug nut's off.",9,Big Bang Theory,30,6
43388,Penny,3, What? What are you doing back?,9,Big Bang Theory,31,6
43389,Leonard,3, We got a flat and couldn't get the tyre off.,9,Big Bang Theory,45,10
43390,Penny,3," Oh, I'm sorry.",9,Big Bang Theory,15,3
43391,Leonard,3, Thank you.,9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
43392,Penny,3," If it makes you feel any better, I pierced Amy's ears and her mom made her sit in my closet.",9,Big Bang Theory,93,20
43393,Sheldon,3, We blew up Feynman's van.,9,Big Bang Theory,26,5
43394,Penny,3, My dad killed my pig with his tractor.,9,Big Bang Theory,39,8
43395,Leonard,3, I spent the night in Mexico with Sheldon.,9,Big Bang Theory,42,8
43396,Penny,3, You win.,9,Big Bang Theory,9,2
43398,Sheldon,4," What a wonderful day, thank you.",9,Big Bang Theory,33,6
43399,Penny,4," Oh, we're glad you had fun.",9,Big Bang Theory,28,6
43400,Sheldon,4," Blue Icees and a trip to The Container Store? It's like I died and went to the post-mortem, neuron-induced hallucination commonly mistaken as heaven.",9,Big Bang Theory,150,24
43401,Leonard,4, I still don't understand why you bought that pill caddie. You're a young man.,9,Big Bang Theory,78,14
43402,Sheldon,4," Age is a state of mind, Leonard. In here I'm 90. Why are you taking your bins over there?",9,Big Bang Theory,90,19
43403,Leonard,4," It's just where I need them. You know, she doesn't have a lot of closet space.",9,Big Bang Theory,79,16
43404,Sheldon,4, What's wrong with your closet?,9,Big Bang Theory,31,5
43405,Penny,4," Uh, well, honey, you know, now that Leonard and I are married, it kind of makes sense that we actually live together.",9,Big Bang Theory,118,22
43406,Sheldon,4, So that's all this day was? A plan to butter me up before delivering bad news?,9,Big Bang Theory,79,16
43407,Leonard,4," Come on, buddy.",9,Big Bang Theory,16,3
43408,Sheldon,4," No, I thought we were friends. You asked for a sip of my Icee. If you had your own straw, I might've said yes.",9,Big Bang Theory,111,24
43409,Penny,4," Sheldon, please, we already feel bad about this.",9,Big Bang Theory,49,8
43410,Sheldon,4," You know what they don't sell at The Container Store? Something large enough to contain my disappointment. Although, if anyone did, it would be them.",9,Big Bang Theory,150,25
43412,Sheldon,4, Thank you for letting me come speak with you.,9,Big Bang Theory,46,9
43414,Sheldon,4," As my relationships with Penny and Amy are currently strained, I'm turning to you for female comfort and encouragement.",9,Big Bang Theory,120,19
43416,Sheldon,4," I tried reaching out to my mother, but she was in Bible study. Leonard's mother is on a book tour. My Mee-Maw was taking a nap, and after a while Siri started repeating her answers.",9,Big Bang Theory,182,35
43418,Sheldon,4," Yeah, I know, top ten, pretty exciting.",9,Big Bang Theory,40,7
43420,Sheldon,4," Well, in addition to Amy leaving me, Leonard's moving in with Penny. It's difficult not to feel abandoned.",9,Big Bang Theory,107,18
43422,Sheldon,4, Perhaps I could find someone better than Leonard. Someone I can rub in his face. Chris Pratt's all the rage right now. I wonder how he'd feel about taking the smaller bedroom.,9,Big Bang Theory,176,32
43425,Sheldon,4," Gandalf, but he's a smoker.",9,Big Bang Theory,28,5
43433,Raj,4, Have you seen this Archie comic? It's actually Archie versus Predator.,9,Big Bang Theory,71,11
43434,Howard,4, How could Archie defeat Predator?,9,Big Bang Theory,34,5
43435,Raj,4, I don't know. Maybe Jughead's a Terminator.,9,Big Bang Theory,44,7
43437,Howard,4," Hey, Stuart.",9,Big Bang Theory,13,2
43439,Howard,4, Why?,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
43441,Howard,4, What kind of music are you thinking of?,9,Big Bang Theory,40,8
43443,Raj,4," Hey, we've always talked about playing together.",9,Big Bang Theory,49,7
43444,Howard,4," Well, it could be fun to try a little acoustic thing.",9,Big Bang Theory,54,11
43445,Raj,4," Oh, we could play filk music.",9,Big Bang Theory,30,6
43447,Raj,4," It's been around for years. It's like folk music, but with a sci-fi/fantasy theme.",9,Big Bang Theory,83,14
43449,Raj,4," Dude, if we do this, we're gonna need a cool band name.",9,Big Bang Theory,56,12
43450,Howard,4," You know, I've actually had one I've been sitting on for years.",9,Big Bang Theory,64,12
43451,Raj,4, Really?,9,Big Bang Theory,8,1
43452,Howard,4," It was for this power trio I tried to put together in junior high, but I was short two friends.",9,Big Bang Theory,96,20
43453,Raj,4, What is it?,9,Big Bang Theory,12,3
43454,Howard,4, Footprints on the Moon.,9,Big Bang Theory,24,4
43455,Raj,4, I just got chills.,9,Big Bang Theory,19,4
43456,Howard,4, So did I.,9,Big Bang Theory,10,3
43459,Sheldon,4," Just a few more signatures, and we'll be finished. Initial here to acknowledge that you've returned your key. Okay. As my future neighbour, I'd like you to have a key. Initial here to acknowledge you received it.",9,Big Bang Theory,213,37
43460,Penny,4, I'm proud of you. You're taking this really well.,9,Big Bang Theory,50,9
43461,Sheldon,4," Well, it's not like I'm never going to see you two again. Which brings us to article 23 subsection C, please check here to reserve your spot at the ten year roommate reunion.",9,Big Bang Theory,175,33
43462,Leonard,4, Do I really have to do that now?,9,Big Bang Theory,33,8
43463,Sheldon,4," No, but if you want chicken and get stuck with the fish, that's on you. All right. Oh, and lastly, please initial here to confirm that ownership of the living room couch is hereby transferred to me in perpetuity all throughout the universe and all alternate universes except for those universes where owning a couch is forbidden by the hive queen. In which case, all glory to the hive queen. All right, now all that's left is for us to sign and date the document, and we will officially no longer be roommates.",9,Big Bang Theory,511,93
43464,Penny,4, What's the matter?,9,Big Bang Theory,19,3
43465,Leonard,4, It's harder than I thought.,9,Big Bang Theory,28,5
43466,Sheldon,4, Let me help you. L. E. O. N.,9,Big Bang Theory,29,8
43467,Leonard,4, That helped.,9,Big Bang Theory,13,2
43469,Raj,4," So I have an idea for a filk song. It's kind of a, a power ballad, superhero crossover tale of epic proportions.",9,Big Bang Theory,113,22
43470,Howard,4," Is it cold in here, 'cause, oh, my.",9,Big Bang Theory,36,8
43471,Raj,4," Okay, so it's a, it's a David and Goliath story. It's about man against God. It's called Hammer and Whip, The Untold Story of Thor versus Indiana Jones.",9,Big Bang Theory,153,28
43472,Howard,4, Thor versus Indiana Jones? You just blew my filking mind.,9,Big Bang Theory,58,10
43473,Raj,4," Okay, I don't have it all worked out yet, but I was thinking something like, um, Oh, Indy, oh, Indy, the skies are so windy. Is that a flying man with a killer bod? Wait, that's no man, it's a Norse god.",9,Big Bang Theory,204,42
43474,Howard,4," Oh yes, definitely. Hang on. Thunder clapped as Thor raised his mighty hammer. Indy rapped, that's one bad mamma-jamma.",9,Big Bang Theory,120,19
43475,Raj,4," That is, that is so good!",9,Big Bang Theory,26,6
43476,Howard,4, Right? Mamma-jamma just came to me.,9,Big Bang Theory,36,6
43477,Raj,4," Okay, and here's the hook. Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One plays with lightning, the other plays with bones.",9,Big Bang Theory,121,22
43479,Howard,4," Oh, man, that rocks.",9,Big Bang Theory,21,4
43480,Raj,4," Hey, remember The Ark of the Covenant?",9,Big Bang Theory,39,7
43481,Howard,4, Yeah?,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
43482,Raj,4, That's how much we're gonna melt people's faces off.,9,Big Bang Theory,53,9
43484,Sheldon,4, I appreciate your interest in the apartment. I just need to ask you a few standard questions.,9,Big Bang Theory,94,17
43486,Sheldon,4, It says here you're a chemist. Which element on the periodic table do you feel is too big for its britches?,9,Big Bang Theory,108,21
43488,Sheldon,4, Looks like argon's not the only one with an attitude problem.,9,Big Bang Theory,62,11
43489,Sheldon,4," In general, would you say that you smell better, worse or the same as you do right now?",9,Big Bang Theory,88,18
43490,Sheldon,4," I was going to ask you what is the best fruit, but then I realized what I want to ask you is why is there a Band-Aid on your forearm, but then I realized what I really want to ask you is just can you just go?",9,Big Bang Theory,209,47
43491,Sheldon,4," You're healthy. You have a job in the sciences. I've got to say, if this credit report comes back good, you're the frontrunner.",9,Big Bang Theory,128,23
43492,Amy,4," I'm not gonna be your roommate, Sheldon.",9,Big Bang Theory,41,7
43493,Sheldon,4," But I met with 11 people, and they all walked out. And that Hollywood phoney Chris Pratt never tweeted me back.",9,Big Bang Theory,112,21
43494,Amy,4, I'm sure you'll find somebody else.,9,Big Bang Theory,36,6
43495,Sheldon,4," I suppose. What happened to me, Amy? Years ago I was completely disengaged from my feelings. I'd say it was a happier time, but I was disengaged from my feelings, so who can tell?",9,Big Bang Theory,180,34
43496,Amy,4," I don't know how to help you. You know, feelings are a part of life.",9,Big Bang Theory,69,15
43497,Sheldon,4," They didn't used to be. You and Leonard and Penny, you all poisoned me with emotions. I was like the Tin Man, perfectly content until that evil wizard gave him a heart.",9,Big Bang Theory,169,32
43498,Amy,4, I don't think that was the point of the movie.,9,Big Bang Theory,47,10
43499,Sheldon,4," Fine, then I was like Pinocchio before that jerk Geppetto went and made him a real boy.",9,Big Bang Theory,88,17
43500,Amy,4, There you go.,9,Big Bang Theory,14,3
43502,Penny,4," So, what are you thinking for dinner?",9,Big Bang Theory,38,7
43503,Leonard,4," Well, it's Thai food night.",9,Big Bang Theory,28,5
43504,Penny,4," Well, honey, you don't live with Sheldon any more. You can have anything you want.",9,Big Bang Theory,83,15
43505,Leonard,4, You're right. But what? Mexican? Italian? German? Indian? Greek? Cuban? Chinese? Pizza? Barbecue? Korean? Korean barbecue?,9,Big Bang Theory,123,16
43506,Penny,4, How about Thai food?,9,Big Bang Theory,21,4
43507,Leonard,4," Oh, thank God.",9,Big Bang Theory,15,3
43508,Penny,4," Hey, we're going to dinner. You want to come?",9,Big Bang Theory,46,9
43509,Sheldon,4," Oh, I wish I could, but I realized I've become too emotionally vulnerable, so, like an operating system, I'm restoring my life to the last stable version, which was in 2003, the day before I met Leonard.",9,Big Bang Theory,204,37
43510,Leonard,4," You heard him, no.",9,Big Bang Theory,19,4
43511,Penny,4," Hang on. Wait, you actually think it's 2003?",9,Big Bang Theory,45,8
43512,Sheldon,4," No, just because I'm living my life like it was 12 years ago doesn't mean I'm delusional. And since it is 2003, I don't know who you are, so please exit the premises before I call the police on my stylish new flip phone.",9,Big Bang Theory,221,44
43514,Penny,4, Are you doing okay?,9,Big Bang Theory,20,4
43515,Leonard,4," I guess. I'm just, you know, worried about Sheldon.",9,Big Bang Theory,52,9
43516,Penny,4," Well, come on, he's a grown man in his 30s pretending to be a grown man in his 20s. He's fine.",9,Big Bang Theory,95,21
43517,Leonard,4, I hope so.,9,Big Bang Theory,11,3
43518,Penny,4, What else can you do? Move back in with him?,9,Big Bang Theory,45,10
43519,Leonard,4," No, of course not. I just feel bad.",9,Big Bang Theory,36,8
43520,Penny,4," Well, so do I, but don't you want to live with your wife and set the thermostat to whatever you want and have your body tell you when it's time to go to the bathroom, you know, not a schedule slipped underneath your door every morning?",9,Big Bang Theory,236,46
43521,Leonard,4, I did like that he had the weather on it.,9,Big Bang Theory,42,10
43522,Penny,4," Trust me, this is the right thing.",9,Big Bang Theory,35,7
43523,Leonard,4," I know. And it's not like we're abandoning him. Plus, we can FaceTime him whenever we want, you know, once iPhones are invented in his universe.",9,Big Bang Theory,145,26
43526,Amy,4, I can't believe he ran my credit.,9,Big Bang Theory,34,7
43528,Amy,4, You really should've gone on the Internet and checked how long that kind of thing lives before you got one.,9,Big Bang Theory,108,20
43530,Amy,4," Hey, I know Sheldon's quirky, but he's also brilliant and insightful. I think calling him a weirdo is a little unfair.",9,Big Bang Theory,119,21
43532,Sheldon,4," Hello, 2003.",9,Big Bang Theory,13,2
43533,Leonard,4," Hey, we brought you Thai. Where is everything?",9,Big Bang Theory,47,8
43534,Sheldon,4," In my present, it's in the future. In your present, it's been crammed in the bedroom by an enterprising young man I met in The Home Depot parking lot.",9,Big Bang Theory,151,29
43535,Leonard,4," I know what you're doing. You're trying to get attention so we'll feel bad for you, but it's not happening.",9,Big Bang Theory,108,20
43536,Sheldon,4," No, what I'm doing is trying to figure out how to live my life now that everyone is leaving me.",9,Big Bang Theory,96,20
43537,Leonard,4, Will you knock it off? We're across the hall.,9,Big Bang Theory,46,9
43538,Sheldon,4," As the kids are saying today, talk to the hand.",9,Big Bang Theory,48,10
43539,Penny,4, They're not saying that.,9,Big Bang Theory,25,4
43540,Sheldon,4, They are in 2003.,9,Big Bang Theory,18,4
43541,Penny,4," No, no, they're really not.",9,Big Bang Theory,28,5
43543,Raj,4," Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One runs from Loki, the other runs from stones. So, what do you think?",9,Big Bang Theory,111,22
43545,Raj,4," Runs from stones means that, that big boulder, but I couldn't rhyme anything with boulder.",9,Big Bang Theory,91,15
43547,Raj,4," Right, yeah, right. But, what do you think?",9,Big Bang Theory,44,8
43549,Raj,4, Cute? It's not cute. Cute is children dressed as vegetables.,9,Big Bang Theory,61,10
43551,Raj,4, Just be honest. You don't like it.,9,Big Bang Theory,35,7
43553,Raj,4," You can dance to this. Um, uh, uh, Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One plays with lightning, the other plays with bones.",9,Big Bang Theory,129,25
43555,Raj,4," I'm telling you, dude, the song has no groove, you can't dance to it.",9,Big Bang Theory,70,14
43556,Howard,4, Who cares? I thought the whole point of Footprints on the Moon was to write songs that make people think.,9,Big Bang Theory,106,20
43557,Raj,4," You can do both, like Michael Jackson's Billie Jean. While you're dancing you're thinking, like, darn it, whose baby is it?",9,Big Bang Theory,124,21
43558,Howard,4," Where's this coming from? A few hours ago, we both loved this song.",9,Big Bang Theory,68,13
43559,Raj,4, I still love it. I just think there's room for improvement.,9,Big Bang Theory,60,11
43560,Howard,4," You played it for Emily, didn't you?",9,Big Bang Theory,37,7
43561,Raj,4," Yeah, so what?",9,Big Bang Theory,15,3
43562,Howard,4," You are such a wimp. She didn't like it, now you don't like it.",9,Big Bang Theory,64,14
43563,Raj,4," No, no. I'm just evolving as a musician. You're the one who's stuck in the past.",9,Big Bang Theory,81,16
43564,Howard,4, The past was lunch. You know what's really happening here? Your girlfriend is breaking up our band.,9,Big Bang Theory,100,17
43565,Raj,4, She has nothing to do with this. I am my own man.,9,Big Bang Theory,50,12
43566,Howard,4," Oh, please. Your brain belongs to whoever's willing to sleep with you.",9,Big Bang Theory,71,12
43567,Raj,4, That is so not true.,9,Big Bang Theory,21,5
43568,Howard,4, Really? Remember when you were gonna get circumcised for Rachel Bernstein?,9,Big Bang Theory,75,11
43569,Raj,4, That had nothing to do with Rachel. It was an overreaction to a bad zipper injury.,9,Big Bang Theory,83,16
43570,Howard,4, I don't need this. I'm quitting the band.,9,Big Bang Theory,42,8
43571,Raj,4," Fine, I quit, too.",9,Big Bang Theory,19,4
43572,Howard,4, Then get out of my house.,9,Big Bang Theory,26,6
43573,Raj,4, With pleasure.,9,Big Bang Theory,15,2
43574,Howard,4," Raj, wait.",9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
43575,Raj,4, What took you so long?,9,Big Bang Theory,23,5
43577,Leonard,4," Buddy, I know me moving in with Penny feels like a big change, but it's not.",9,Big Bang Theory,77,16
43578,Sheldon,4," How can you say that? Amy's gone, and you two are married now, so it's only a matter of time before you're gone, too.",9,Big Bang Theory,118,24
43579,Penny,4," Okay, you don't know what's gonna happen.",9,Big Bang Theory,42,7
43580,Sheldon,4," No, I do. Eventually you'll want more space, and you'll move into a house, and then instead of dinner a couple of times a week, it'll only be a couple of times a month, and then it'll only be on special occasions, like when Bernadette divorces Wolowitz. Or, or, or like when Koothrappali's weird girlfriend admits where she buried his body. Or Amy's wedding, where she's marrying someone better than me.",9,Big Bang Theory,404,71
43581,Penny,4," Okay, look, we don't need to rush into anything. All right? Maybe instead of Leonard moving in with me, we just leave things the way they are, and sometimes we'll sleep over there, and sometimes we'll sleep over here.",9,Big Bang Theory,218,39
43582,Sheldon,4, But mostly here.,9,Big Bang Theory,17,3
43583,Penny,4, Sure.,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
43584,Leonard,4," Wuh, what about what you said in the restaurant?",9,Big Bang Theory,49,9
43585,Penny,4," Well, it's not forever. It's just for a while. If you want, we can think of him like he's our dog.",9,Big Bang Theory,99,21
43586,Sheldon,4," You can. I'm happy when you come home. And I'm scared of fireworks. By the way, on July Fourth, we're all sleeping here.",9,Big Bang Theory,121,23
43587,Leonard,4, Fine.,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
43588,Sheldon,4," All right, great. Just give me one minute, and I'll get started on a new roommate agreement. Yeah. nothing from Pratt, we're good.",9,Big Bang Theory,131,23
43590,Howard,4," Indy' whip snapped, Thor's hammer missed.",9,Big Bang Theory,42,6
43591,Raj,4, It was Avenger versus archeologist.,9,Big Bang Theory,36,5
43592,Howard,4," Indy held his ground, and straightened his fedora.",9,Big Bang Theory,51,8
43593,Raj,4," Thor said, that's a nice look in nineteen fourty-foura.",9,Big Bang Theory,56,9
43597,Leonard,5," Hey, ready for lunch?",9,Big Bang Theory,22,4
43598,Howard,5," Oh, one sec.",9,Big Bang Theory,13,3
43599,Sheldon,5, Is that the prototype drive system for the high-G rover?,9,Big Bang Theory,57,10
43600,Howard,5," No, Bernadette got me a Fitbit so she can track how much I'm exercising.",9,Big Bang Theory,73,14
43601,Leonard,5, That'll teach her to care about your health.,9,Big Bang Theory,45,8
43602,Howard,5," Yeah, I can't wait to see the look on her face when I die young.",9,Big Bang Theory,65,15
43603,Raj,5, When was the last actual exercise you got?,9,Big Bang Theory,43,8
43604,Howard,5," The other day, when she tried to put that Fitbit on me and I ran away from her.",9,Big Bang Theory,80,18
43605,Sheldon,5," According to a recent study, simply thinking about exercise, even while sitting still, can have physical benefits. For all you know, I could be exercising right now.",9,Big Bang Theory,166,27
43606,Raj,5, Are you?,9,Big Bang Theory,9,2
43607,Sheldon,5," Nah, I'll do it tomorrow.",9,Big Bang Theory,26,5
43608,Leonard,5, It wouldn't be the worst thing if we were more active.,9,Big Bang Theory,55,11
43609,Howard,5," You make an excellent point. Ooh, I think I'm getting a runner's high.",9,Big Bang Theory,71,13
43611,Leonard,5," Look at all these activities the university has. Rock climbing club, archery, flag football.",9,Big Bang Theory,93,14
43612,Sheldon,5," Had me at flag, lost me at football.",9,Big Bang Theory,37,8
43613,Penny,5," Yeah, I think it's great you guys want to get more exercise, but do you really think sports is the right choice for you?",9,Big Bang Theory,121,24
43614,Leonard,5, What are you saying? We're not coordinated enough to play sports?,9,Big Bang Theory,66,11
43615,Penny,5," Okay, Leonard, sweetheart, you twisted your ankle playing Scrabble.",9,Big Bang Theory,68,9
43616,Leonard,5," I got a triple-word score with a double letter Q. If that's not a time to bust out the scrabble dance, what's the point of having one? Hey, Barry Kripke started a fencing club.",9,Big Bang Theory,177,34
43617,Sheldon,5, Interesting. Sword fighting does hold a certain elegant appeal. And I would imagine it meets many of our personal criteria for a sport.,9,Big Bang Theory,136,23
43618,Leonard,5," It's indoors, so no sunscreen.",9,Big Bang Theory,31,5
43619,Sheldon,5," No throwing, no catching, no running.",9,Big Bang Theory,38,6
43620,Leonard,5, No gym shorts that can be yanked down.,9,Big Bang Theory,39,8
43621,Sheldon,5," Or worse, up.",9,Big Bang Theory,14,3
43622,Leonard,5, Preach.,9,Big Bang Theory,8,1
43623,Sheldon,5," And as an added bonus, the word touchÃ© comes from fencing. It would be our only opportunity to use it in a non-metaphorical sense.",9,Big Bang Theory,132,24
43624,Leonard,5, What about a game of tag on a French schoolyard?,9,Big Bang Theory,49,10
43625,Sheldon,5," Ah, touchÃ©.",9,Big Bang Theory,13,2
43630,Penny,5," All right, well, what have you tried so far?",9,Big Bang Theory,45,9
43632,Penny,5, Really? In a comic book store?,9,Big Bang Theory,31,6
43634,Amy,5," Well, for starters, you might want to rethink some of this artwork. I mean, this woman's actually on a leash like a dog.",9,Big Bang Theory,121,23
43637,Raj,5, I feel cool. Like Puss in Boots.,9,Big Bang Theory,33,7
43638,Leonard,5, I always wanted to be a swashbuckler when I was a kid.,9,Big Bang Theory,55,12
43639,Sheldon,5," Technically, swashbuckler is a combination of two terms. Swash referring to the sound of the sword. Swash. And then buckler meaning a small shield, which you don't have.",9,Big Bang Theory,170,28
43640,Raj,5, We can still be swashers.,9,Big Bang Theory,26,5
43641,Howard,5," Well said, Puss.",9,Big Bang Theory,17,3
43643,Leonard,5, That's not why we're here.,9,Big Bang Theory,27,5
43644,Raj,5," Yeah, I'm here because I think it's gonna be like Game of Thrones.",9,Big Bang Theory,67,13
43645,Howard,5, And maybe a little Princess Bride.,9,Big Bang Theory,35,6
43646,Raj,5," Ooh, ooh, I forgot about Princess Bride. That's my answer.",9,Big Bang Theory,59,10
43648,Sheldon,5, We're not afraid of physical activity.,9,Big Bang Theory,39,6
43649,Howard,5, Yeah. I already ran 18 miles today.,9,Big Bang Theory,36,7
43651,Sheldon,5," Oh, dear.",9,Big Bang Theory,10,2
43653,Sheldon,5," Well, I'm not sure I have a dominant leg. They're both pretty submissive.",9,Big Bang Theory,74,13
43654,Howard,5," When you're in a public restroom, which foot do you flush the toilet with?",9,Big Bang Theory,75,14
43655,Sheldon,5, Right. Always right.,9,Big Bang Theory,21,3
43656,Howard,5, He's a righty.,9,Big Bang Theory,15,3
43658,Howard,5," Oh, God, I am going to feel this tomorrow.",9,Big Bang Theory,43,9
43660,Leonard,5, This is easy. I didn't need to wear a cup.,9,Big Bang Theory,43,10
43662,Sheldon,5," Excuse me, Barry?",9,Big Bang Theory,18,3
43664,Sheldon,5, When can I stab one of my friends?,9,Big Bang Theory,35,8
43666,Sheldon,5," Uh, yes, I'm aware. But if I say I want to touch one of my friends, I'll get called into Human Resources.",9,Big Bang Theory,106,22
43669,Amy,5, Have you thought about advertising directly to females?,9,Big Bang Theory,56,8
43671,Penny,5," Hey, have you read the online reviews for this place?",9,Big Bang Theory,54,10
43673,Penny,5," All right, well, Heather H says, the owner stared at me the whole time and didn't blink once. Kelly M says, the creepy guy who runs it asked me out, then called himself stupid before I could say no. Jessica K says, I told the weird owner that I liked his shirt. He took it off and gave it to me.",9,Big Bang Theory,296,61
43677,Raj,5, Look at us. We're like the Rockettes.,9,Big Bang Theory,38,7
43678,Sheldon,5," En garde, Leonard. Prepare yourself for a rigorous touching.",9,Big Bang Theory,61,9
43679,Howard,5, My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.,9,Big Bang Theory,64,12
43680,Raj,5, My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.,9,Big Bang Theory,64,12
43681,Howard,5, I thought you were Puss in Boots.,9,Big Bang Theory,34,7
43682,Raj,5," Oh, yeah, right. Sorry. My name is Puss in Boots. You killed my father. Prepare to die.",9,Big Bang Theory,88,17
43683,Sheldon,5, I'm looking forward to him teaching us glove-slapping.,9,Big Bang Theory,55,8
43684,Leonard,5, What?,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
43685,Sheldon,5," You know, when my honour is insulted, and I need to challenge someone to a duel by slapping them across the face with my glove.",9,Big Bang Theory,128,25
43686,Leonard,5, When was your honour insulted?,9,Big Bang Theory,31,5
43687,Sheldon,5, My last physical.,9,Big Bang Theory,18,3
43688,Leonard,5," Again, that doctor didn't insult your honour. Just checked your prostate.",9,Big Bang Theory,74,11
43689,Raj,5, My name is Little Orphan Annie. You killed my father. Prepare to die.,9,Big Bang Theory,70,13
43690,Howard,5, My name is Darth Vader. I am your father. Prepare to die.,9,Big Bang Theory,58,12
43691,Sheldon,5," Ah, this is fun.",9,Big Bang Theory,17,4
43692,Leonard,5," Well, good. It's nice to see your mind off Amy.",9,Big Bang Theory,48,10
43694,Sheldon,5," Not that it's any of your business, but she broke up with me.",9,Big Bang Theory,62,13
43696,Sheldon,5, Good to know? What's that supposed to mean?,9,Big Bang Theory,44,8
43697,Leonard,5," Oh. I hate to say it, but it sounds like he's interested in her.",9,Big Bang Theory,65,14
43698,Sheldon,5," Well, that's unacceptable.",9,Big Bang Theory,27,3
43699,Leonard,5," Oh, buddy, I get that you don't like it, but it's not really up to you.",9,Big Bang Theory,72,16
43700,Sheldon,5," Yeah, but he's dumb, and his face is dumb.",9,Big Bang Theory,43,9
43701,Leonard,5," Look, even if it's not him, Amy's probably going to date someone at some point.",9,Big Bang Theory,80,15
43702,Sheldon,5, You really think so?,9,Big Bang Theory,21,4
43703,Leonard,5, Of course. She deserves to be happy.,9,Big Bang Theory,37,7
43704,Sheldon,5, How dare you.,9,Big Bang Theory,14,3
43706,Leonard,5," Listen, I should warn you that maybe asking Amy out isn't a good idea.",9,Big Bang Theory,71,14
43707,Sheldon,5," Barry, a word?",9,Big Bang Theory,15,3
43708,Leonard,5, And now the crazy version of what I just said.,9,Big Bang Theory,47,10
43709,Sheldon,5," If you intend to pursue Amy, you leave me with no choice but to put a stop to it.",9,Big Bang Theory,82,19
43711,Sheldon,5, By challenging you to a duel.,9,Big Bang Theory,30,6
43713,Sheldon,5," That is why the duel will take place at high noon, three years from today. If you're worth your salt as an instructor, I should be ready by then. Yeah, and be warned. I'm going to touch you all over.",9,Big Bang Theory,200,40
43714,Leonard,5," Wow. That, that was crazier than I thought.",9,Big Bang Theory,44,8
43717,Penny,5, Yeah.,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
43719,Amy,5, You can say it.,9,Big Bang Theory,16,4
43721,Penny,5," Well, you're talking to us now. I mean, you don't seem nervous.",9,Big Bang Theory,64,12
43723,Amy,5, Do you not hear how creepy that sounds?,9,Big Bang Theory,40,8
43727,Penny,5," Okay. Don't be offended, but, what went wrong with you?",9,Big Bang Theory,56,10
43731,Amy,5," Stuart, believe it or not, I understand. You know, before I met Sheldon, I was alone for a really long time. I was so desperate for people to like me, when I met these guys, it took everything in my power to hide my insecurity.",9,Big Bang Theory,228,45
43733,Amy,5," Suddenly, the rabbit thing makes sense.",9,Big Bang Theory,40,6
43735,Leonard,5," I'm surprised you wanted to go to a sports bar, Sheldon.",9,Big Bang Theory,57,11
43736,Sheldon,5," Look at this blister. Like it or not, we're athletes now. Besides, a bar is where I belong. I'm having female problems.",9,Big Bang Theory,120,22
43737,Leonard,5," If you're cranky and retaining water, I have a theory.",9,Big Bang Theory,55,10
43738,Howard,5," Sheldon, instead of focusing on Amy dating other guys, maybe you should start thinking about dating another girl.",9,Big Bang Theory,114,18
43739,Sheldon,5, That's ridiculous.,9,Big Bang Theory,19,2
43740,Raj,5," Why? You never thought you'd end up in a relationship, and then you met Amy. Maybe there's someone else out there for you.",9,Big Bang Theory,123,23
43741,Sheldon,5," True, but Penny's married, and so is Bernadette. And your girlfriend has red hair and white skin, which really rubs up against my clown phobia.",9,Big Bang Theory,144,25
43742,Leonard,5, Maybe you should consider women who aren't in serious relationships with your closest friends?,9,Big Bang Theory,95,14
43743,Sheldon,5," There's that prostate doctor, but I'm still mad at her. Oh, there's a woman. I'll make her my girlfriend.",9,Big Bang Theory,106,19
43744,Raj,5," Whoa, whoa. Walking up to a strange woman in a bar usually doesn't work.",9,Big Bang Theory,73,14
43745,Sheldon,5, You're forgetting something. Ladies love jocks.,9,Big Bang Theory,48,6
43746,Raj,5, How many sips of that beer did he have?,9,Big Bang Theory,40,9
43747,Leonard,5, Three.,9,Big Bang Theory,7,1
43748,Howard,5," Oh, boy.",9,Big Bang Theory,9,2
43749,Sheldon,5," Excuse me. I'm recovering from a recent breakup, and I'm told asking out another woman might make me feel better. And as Ash Ketchum said to Pikachu, I choose you.",9,Big Bang Theory,164,30
43751,Sheldon,5, It's a PokÃ©mon reference.,9,Big Bang Theory,27,4
43753,Sheldon,5," Well, we gave it a shot. How about you?",9,Big Bang Theory,40,9
43755,Sheldon,5," Ah, what might have been. And you, give my regards to Barnum and Bailey.",9,Big Bang Theory,73,14
43758,Penny,5," Well, he knew he was on the breast cam.",9,Big Bang Theory,40,9
43759,Amy,5, I don't have much experience turning men down. It wasn't so much fun.,9,Big Bang Theory,70,13
43761,Penny,5, And sometimes we marry them anyway.,9,Big Bang Theory,36,6
43762,Amy,5," Huh. Well, this is weird.",9,Big Bang Theory,26,5
43763,Penny,5, What?,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
43764,Amy,5, Barry Kripke just asked me out.,9,Big Bang Theory,32,6
43766,Penny,5, I told you things would change if you plucked your eyebrows.,9,Big Bang Theory,61,11
43768,Amy,5," Hi, how are you? I was wondering if you'd like to get a drink after work sometime.",9,Big Bang Theory,83,17
43769,Penny,5," Well, what are you gonna do?",9,Big Bang Theory,29,6
43770,Amy,5," I don't know. I guess I assumed that I would eventually date other people, but this is happening so fast.",9,Big Bang Theory,106,20
43772,Amy,5," Well, I was hoping the next person I dated would be a little less like Sheldon.",9,Big Bang Theory,80,16
43774,Penny,5, I think she means not a weirdo.,9,Big Bang Theory,32,7
43776,Amy,5, I don't know.,9,Big Bang Theory,14,3
43777,Penny,5," All right, well, what happens if you imagine him naked?",9,Big Bang Theory,56,10
43778,Amy,5," Oh, I don't have to imagine it.",9,Big Bang Theory,32,7
43780,Sheldon,5, I smell funny. I taste salty.,9,Big Bang Theory,30,6
43781,Leonard,5, You're just sweaty from exercise.,9,Big Bang Theory,34,5
43782,Sheldon,5, And kind of delicious. I wonder how many licks it would take to get to the centre of me.,9,Big Bang Theory,89,19
43783,Leonard,5, I know it only takes one doctor's finger.,9,Big Bang Theory,42,8
43784,Amy,5, Hello.,9,Big Bang Theory,7,1
43785,Sheldon,5, Hello.,9,Big Bang Theory,7,1
43786,Leonard,5, We should let you guys talk.,9,Big Bang Theory,29,6
43788,Sheldon,5, You don't have to leave.,9,Big Bang Theory,25,5
43789,Leonard,5, Look at me go.,9,Big Bang Theory,15,4
43790,Amy,5," Uh, Bernadette, you're my ride.",9,Big Bang Theory,32,5
43792,Amy,5, How have you been?,9,Big Bang Theory,19,4
43793,Sheldon,5, I'm doing all right. I tried fencing today.,9,Big Bang Theory,44,8
43794,Amy,5, How'd that go?,9,Big Bang Theory,15,3
43795,Sheldon,5, It was pretty easy. And I think my background in mathletics helped. Barry Kripke was there. I should let you know that he expressed interest in asking you out.,9,Big Bang Theory,160,29
43796,Amy,5," Well, actually, he, he already did.",9,Big Bang Theory,36,6
43797,Sheldon,5," Okay. But don't get too attached to him. in two years, 364 days, he's a dead man.",9,Big Bang Theory,82,17
43798,Amy,5, I said no.,9,Big Bang Theory,11,3
43799,Sheldon,5," Interesting. I asked two women out today, and they both said no.",9,Big Bang Theory,65,12
43800,Amy,5, I didn't know you were interested in dating.,9,Big Bang Theory,45,8
43801,Sheldon,5, I've been told it's a good way to move on.,9,Big Bang Theory,43,10
43802,Amy,5," Oh. Okay. Anyway, um, it's nice to see you. You look good.",9,Big Bang Theory,59,12
43803,Sheldon,5, Thanks. And I taste good too.,9,Big Bang Theory,30,6
43806,Howard,5, What's up?,9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
43809,Sheldon,6," Leonard, I've got terrible news.",9,Big Bang Theory,33,5
43810,Leonard,6, What's going on?,9,Big Bang Theory,17,3
43811,Sheldon,6," Before I tell you, perhaps I should soften the blow. You're face is pleasingly symmetrical.",9,Big Bang Theory,92,15
43812,Leonard,6, Just tell me.,9,Big Bang Theory,14,3
43813,Sheldon,6, A Swedish team of physicists is trying to scoop our super-fluid vortex experiment.,9,Big Bang Theory,83,13
43814,Leonard,6," Oh, well, that kind of stinks.",9,Big Bang Theory,31,6
43815,Sheldon,6, That kind of stinks? Why aren't you more upset? Did I soften the blow too much? Because this here is more like a Picasso painting.,9,Big Bang Theory,131,25
43816,Leonard,6, What are we going to do?,9,Big Bang Theory,25,6
43817,Sheldon,6, Perform the experiment immediately.,9,Big Bang Theory,36,4
43818,Leonard,6," I'd love to, but we need liquid helium and our shipment's on back order for a month.",9,Big Bang Theory,85,17
43819,Sheldon,6, A month? What? Are you kidding me? That would have been a good time for you to soften the blow.,9,Big Bang Theory,96,20
43820,Leonard,6, That shirt brings out the blue in your eyes.,9,Big Bang Theory,45,9
43821,Sheldon,6, Thank you. Aren't you sweet.,9,Big Bang Theory,29,5
43822,Leonard,6, Let's go check to see if the university has any helium in reserve.,9,Big Bang Theory,67,13
43823,Sheldon,6, Did you know that I almost didn't wear this shirt today?,9,Big Bang Theory,57,11
43825,Leonard,6," Hey, Barry, we're in trouble. We need liquid helium, does the department have any we can use?",9,Big Bang Theory,94,17
43827,Sheldon,6, But you won't need much for that.,9,Big Bang Theory,34,7
43829,Leonard,6," Come on, Barry, there's a Swedish team trying to run our experiment before us. Can't you spare any?",9,Big Bang Theory,100,18
43831,Leonard,6, Yes.,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
43832,Sheldon,6, Not a chance.,9,Big Bang Theory,14,3
43833,Leonard,6, What are you doing?,9,Big Bang Theory,20,4
43834,Sheldon,6," He said be honest, so I was honest. Didn't your mother tell you? It's the best policy. So, what do you say?",9,Big Bang Theory,108,22
43836,Sheldon,6, He could've softened the blow.,9,Big Bang Theory,31,5
43838,Raj,6, Why do you need Kripke? Can't you just go to Party City for helium?,9,Big Bang Theory,68,14
43839,Leonard,6, We'd have to go to every Party City in California.,9,Big Bang Theory,51,10
43840,Howard,6, Sounds like you on Cinco de Mayo.,9,Big Bang Theory,34,7
43841,Raj,6," Hey, people were still talking about that party on siete de Mayo.",9,Big Bang Theory,66,12
43842,Sheldon,6," Leonard, if that Swedish team beats us, I will never be able to enjoy anything from their country again. Which is a shame, because Swedish meatballs are my favourite toothpick-delivered meatball.",9,Big Bang Theory,196,31
43843,Howard,6," If you need liquid helium so bad, I know a guy who can get you some, if you don't ask too many questions.",9,Big Bang Theory,106,23
43844,Leonard,6, Who is he?,9,Big Bang Theory,11,3
43845,Sheldon,6, Where does he work?,9,Big Bang Theory,20,4
43846,Leonard,6, How does he get the helium?,9,Big Bang Theory,28,6
43847,Sheldon,6, How many questions are too many questions?,9,Big Bang Theory,43,7
43848,Howard,6, Maybe he's not for you.,9,Big Bang Theory,24,5
43849,Sheldon,6, Four questions. There answer's four.,9,Big Bang Theory,37,5
43852,Penny,6," Oh, good for him.",9,Big Bang Theory,18,4
43854,Penny,6," So is she, like, homeless, or framing him for a crime?",9,Big Bang Theory,55,11
43856,Penny,6," Oh, which one? Maybe we can get Amy to try it.",9,Big Bang Theory,47,11
43858,Penny,6," Oh, and if you lose the game, you have to go out with Stuart.",9,Big Bang Theory,62,14
43862,Penny,6, Wow. So how many girls have you met?,9,Big Bang Theory,37,8
43864,Penny,6," Well, so how does it work?",9,Big Bang Theory,27,6
43869,Leonard,6," Oh, hey. I just heard back from the liquid helium guy.",9,Big Bang Theory,55,11
43870,Sheldon,6, What's he say?,9,Big Bang Theory,15,3
43871,Leonard,6, He's got what we need and can meet us tonight.,9,Big Bang Theory,47,10
43872,Leonard,6, The man restocking the cereal shelves.,9,Big Bang Theory,39,6
43873,Sheldon,6, That's right. And what did he do?,9,Big Bang Theory,34,7
43874,Leonard,6, He handed you the box directly and called you Stretch.,9,Big Bang Theory,55,10
43875,Sheldon,6, It's like it was yesterday.,9,Big Bang Theory,28,5
43876,Leonard,6, Do you want liquid helium or not?,9,Big Bang Theory,34,7
43877,Sheldon,6, Of course I do. I don't want that Swedish team scooping us.,9,Big Bang Theory,60,12
43878,Leonard,6, Then I'm going to tell him we're in.,9,Big Bang Theory,37,8
43879,Sheldon,6," Leonard, wait. This is highly unethical.",9,Big Bang Theory,41,6
43880,Leonard,6," We're just bending the rules a little. We have grant money to do the experiment, so we're going to spend it on the helium we need. It's not like when Dr. Goldfarb claimed he bought an electron microscope and he was really just keeping a Russian girl in an apartment in Van Nuys.",9,Big Bang Theory,279,53
43881,Sheldon,6, Was she helping him with his research?,9,Big Bang Theory,39,7
43882,Leonard,6," Sure. So, are we doing this?",9,Big Bang Theory,29,6
43883,Sheldon,6," Well, but where does he get the helium?",9,Big Bang Theory,40,8
43884,Leonard,6, Remember? Don't ask too many questions?,9,Big Bang Theory,40,6
43885,Sheldon,6," Uh, but this is violating university code.",9,Big Bang Theory,43,7
43886,Leonard,6," A little, but if I may quote Einstein, the pursuit of science calls us to ignore the rules set by man.",9,Big Bang Theory,103,21
43887,Sheldon,6," Huh. All right, do it. Tell him we're in.",9,Big Bang Theory,42,9
43888,Leonard,6, Done.,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
43889,Sheldon,6, I can't find that quote on the Internet. Did you make that up?,9,Big Bang Theory,63,13
43890,Leonard,6," Before I answer, may I just say your skin has never looked better.",9,Big Bang Theory,67,13
43891,Sheldon,6, Aren't you just made of sugar.,9,Big Bang Theory,31,6
43893,Amy,6, I'm not sure how I feel about this.,9,Big Bang Theory,36,8
43894,Penny,6," Oh, come on, just let him put the app on your phone.",9,Big Bang Theory,53,12
43897,Penny,6," Okay, let me see. Nope, nope, nope, oh, he's cute.",9,Big Bang Theory,51,10
43899,Penny,6, And he's sad about it.,9,Big Bang Theory,23,5
43900,Howard,6, Hey.,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
43901,Raj,6, Hello.,9,Big Bang Theory,7,1
43902,Penny,6, Hey.,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
43904,Howard,6," If you wanted me to stay out later, you should've given me more spending money.",9,Big Bang Theory,80,15
43905,Raj,6, What are you guys up to?,9,Big Bang Theory,25,6
43907,Raj,6," Oh, fun. Let me see. Uh, no, no, uh, definitely not.",9,Big Bang Theory,53,11
43908,Howard,6, What was wrong with that guy?,9,Big Bang Theory,30,6
43909,Raj,6," Uh, he's Indian. We've already got one of those. Ooh, we should find a nice Latino, really round us out.",9,Big Bang Theory,105,20
43910,Howard,6," Hey, I want to try.",9,Big Bang Theory,20,5
43911,Amy,6," Uh, excuse me, can I have my phone back?",9,Big Bang Theory,41,9
43912,Howard,6," Hang on, I'm trying to find you the next great love of your life. The man who will father your children. Okay, yes or no on white guy with dreadlocks?",9,Big Bang Theory,151,30
43914,Leonard,6, That must be him.,9,Big Bang Theory,18,4
43915,Sheldon,6," Oh, of course. An nondescript, white panel van. You may be familiar with it from the sentence, their bodies were found in a nondescript, white panel van.",9,Big Bang Theory,154,27
43916,Leonard,6, Hey.,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
43918,Leonard,6," Uh, I'm Leonard. This is my friend",9,Big Bang Theory,35,7
43919,Sheldon,6, I'm Skippy. Skippy Cavanaugh.,9,Big Bang Theory,30,4
43921,Leonard,6," Uh, yeah, uh, right here.",9,Big Bang Theory,26,5
43922,Sheldon,6," Wait, hold on, hold on. How do we know that you're not gonna take the money and drive away?",9,Big Bang Theory,92,19
43923,Leonard,6," What ya doing, Skippy?",9,Big Bang Theory,23,4
43924,Sheldon,6, Exactly what 1970s television crime dramas have taught us. You give us the helium first.,9,Big Bang Theory,89,15
43926,Sheldon,6, Guess I'm not the only one who watches '70s television crime dramas.,9,Big Bang Theory,69,12
43927,Leonard,6," Look, you can trust us. We're respected scientists.",9,Big Bang Theory,52,8
43928,Sheldon,6," Well, he is. I'm a wedding planner who can't find love himself. It's ironic, but the point is we can't trust you. You're a sketchy character in a parking garage.",9,Big Bang Theory,162,30
43930,Sheldon,6," Well, I never thought of it like that. Boy, frame of reference will just sneak up on you, won't it?",9,Big Bang Theory,100,20
43931,Leonard,6, My friend does make a decent point about the money. I don't feel comfortable just handing it over up front.,9,Big Bang Theory,108,20
43933,Sheldon,6," Not technically. In chess, a stalemate refers to a situation in which there are no remaining moves. Uh, you have plenty of moves available. You could beat us up and steal the money. You could kill us, you know. Really, you're only limited by your imagination.",9,Big Bang Theory,260,46
43935,Leonard,6, I don't think it matters if this is a stalemate or an impasse or a Mexican standoff. What are we gonna do here?,9,Big Bang Theory,112,23
43937,Sheldon,6," Not necessarily. Uh, many argue the essence of a Mexican standoff is that no one can walk away from the conflict without incurring harm.",9,Big Bang Theory,137,24
43939,Sheldon,6," Let me give you an example. Earlier today, I decoded the headers on your e-mail, and I know that your name is Kenneth Fitzgerald. From that, I figured out where you live and where you work. Now, to make this a Mexican standoff, I would say something like, uh, you give us the helium or I'll turn you in to the authorities.",9,Big Bang Theory,323,62
43941,Sheldon,6," Yeah, exactly. See, you're getting it.",9,Big Bang Theory,39,6
43943,Sheldon,6, Perfect. Now we really are in a Mexican standoff. Is this one of those times where I've won the battle but lost the war?,9,Big Bang Theory,121,24
43944,Leonard,6," Afraid so, Skippy.",9,Big Bang Theory,19,3
43945,Sheldon,6, I told you we shouldn't go shopping at night.,9,Big Bang Theory,46,9
43946,Leonard,6," All right, let's all just calm down. Nobody wants to report anybody.",9,Big Bang Theory,69,12
43948,Leonard,6," No, no, no. Wait, don't go. Just let me explain. We're physicists, and we're trying to prove a hypothesis that we've been working on for over a year.",9,Big Bang Theory,150,28
43950,Sheldon,6, Space-time can be interpreted as the surface of an n-dimensional superfluid.,9,Big Bang Theory,77,11
43952,Leonard,6," Okay, but now there's this Swedish team that read our paper and they're trying to beat us to our own discovery. We really need this helium.",9,Big Bang Theory,140,26
43953,Sheldon,6," And I'm sorry I lied about being a wedding planner who can't find love. Although I am currently single, if you know anybody.",9,Big Bang Theory,125,23
43954,Leonard,6, Here's the money. Can we do this?,9,Big Bang Theory,34,7
43956,Leonard,6, It's actually pretty common in our field. There's not much you can do about it.,9,Big Bang Theory,80,15
43958,Sheldon,6," Did you hear that, Leonard? There's plenty we could do about it. Do you have a card?",9,Big Bang Theory,85,17
43960,Penny,6," Okay, here we go. Now everyone can see. All right. Where do we stand on cross-eyed Mike?",9,Big Bang Theory,89,17
43961,Raj,6, You know he won't be looking at other girls.,9,Big Bang Theory,45,9
43962,Howard,6, Unless they're sitting on the end of his nose.,9,Big Bang Theory,47,9
43963,Penny,6," Okay, okay, okay. Thumbs down. Next.",9,Big Bang Theory,37,6
43965,Penny,6," Well if he's good in bed, she can throw him a fish.",9,Big Bang Theory,52,12
43966,Howard,6," I love you, Amy. ",9,Big Bang Theory,18,4
43967,Amy,6," Okay, I'm starting to feel guilty. Aren't we being a little mean?",9,Big Bang Theory,66,12
43968,Raj,6, That's a fair point. We wouldn't make fun of someone like this to their face.,9,Big Bang Theory,78,15
43969,Penny,6," Look, it's Stuart.",9,Big Bang Theory,19,3
43970,Raj,6, You may want to leave the room.,9,Big Bang Theory,32,7
43972,Sheldon,6," Right this way, Uncle Harvey.",9,Big Bang Theory,30,5
43973,Leonard,6, Will you stop with that already?,9,Big Bang Theory,33,6
43974,Sheldon,6, I'm trying not to attract attention.,9,Big Bang Theory,37,6
43975,Leonard,6, And tipping his hat to the cleaning lady didn't do that?,9,Big Bang Theory,57,11
43976,Sheldon,6, She said buenas noches. What was he supposed to do?,9,Big Bang Theory,52,10
43977,Leonard,6, Let's just start the experiment.,9,Big Bang Theory,33,5
43978,Sheldon,6," Leonard, we should probably have our story straight in case we get caught.",9,Big Bang Theory,75,13
43979,Leonard,6, We're not getting caught.,9,Big Bang Theory,26,4
43980,Sheldon,6," Well, you can't be sure of that. What if the helium dealer rats us out? What if Kripke asks where we got it? What if the university checks my family tree and finds out I don't have an Uncle Harvey?",9,Big Bang Theory,198,40
43981,Leonard,6," The dealer doesn't care, Kripke has no authority over us, and you being related to a metal container would explain a lot. Help me hook this up.",9,Big Bang Theory,144,27
43982,Sheldon,6, Uh-oh.,9,Big Bang Theory,7,1
43983,Leonard,6, What?,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
43984,Sheldon,6," Well, did you see this sticker?",9,Big Bang Theory,32,6
43985,Leonard,6, What is it?,9,Big Bang Theory,12,3
43986,Sheldon,6," It's partially torn off, but the segment that remains reads property of and the letter U.",9,Big Bang Theory,90,16
43987,Leonard,6, It's probably USC or UCLA.,9,Big Bang Theory,27,5
43988,Sheldon,6," Yeah, but what if it's Property of U.S. Government? There's a national helium reserve in Amarillo, Texas. If this was stolen from there, we're accessories to a federal crime.",9,Big Bang Theory,175,29
43989,Leonard,6, Let's not jump to conclusions. A lot of things start with U.,9,Big Bang Theory,61,12
43990,Sheldon,6," That's true. There's the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Department of Defence, U.S. Navy, you and I are going to jail.",9,Big Bang Theory,109,20
43991,Leonard,6," Listen, we can do the experiment as planned and beat the Swedish team to the punch, or we can kiss our dreams good-bye because we were to afraid to break a few rules.",9,Big Bang Theory,167,33
43993,Leonard,6, Ma'am.,9,Big Bang Theory,7,1
43995,Penny,6," Okay, does everyone remember the rules? If he's shirtless, one sip. Posing with a pet, two sips. Pet and shirtless, chug like it's your job. And pull.",9,Big Bang Theory,151,27
43996,Raj,6, I have that same underwear.,9,Big Bang Theory,28,5
43997,Penny,6, Chug.,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
43998,Penny,6," Amy, you're getting a text.",9,Big Bang Theory,28,5
43999,Amy,6," Oh, um, give me that.",9,Big Bang Theory,22,5
44000,Raj,6, I had a great time last night.,9,Big Bang Theory,31,7
44001,Amy,6," No, no, stop reading that.",9,Big Bang Theory,27,5
44002,Howard,6, Who's Dave?,9,Big Bang Theory,12,2
44003,Penny,6, You went on a date last night? Are you seeing someone?,9,Big Bang Theory,55,11
44004,Amy,6," No, it, it's not like that.",9,Big Bang Theory,28,6
44007,Amy,6," Okay, it's like that.",9,Big Bang Theory,22,4
44009,Leonard,6, Thank you for coming back.,9,Big Bang Theory,27,5
44011,Sheldon,6," Anyway, if you could just give us our money back, you can have your helium and we'll be on our way.",9,Big Bang Theory,100,21
44013,Leonard,6," No, nothing. We just changed our mind.",9,Big Bang Theory,39,7
44014,Sheldon,6," He has glasses and I'm a know-it-all, we are not built for prison.",9,Big Bang Theory,67,13
44016,Leonard,6, Thank you.,9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
44018,Sheldon,6, You're taking advantage of us? We clarified nomenclature together.,9,Big Bang Theory,67,9
44020,Leonard,6, You know what? It's fine. Keep the money. We just want to be done with this.,9,Big Bang Theory,77,16
44022,Sheldon,6, I don't understand.,9,Big Bang Theory,20,3
44023,Leonard,6, He wants more money.,9,Big Bang Theory,21,4
44024,Sheldon,6," Well, it better not be more than a thousand dollars. That's all I've got on me.",9,Big Bang Theory,80,16
44026,Sheldon,6," Finally, something breaks our way.",9,Big Bang Theory,35,5
44028,Penny,6, I can't believe you're seeing someone and we don't even know about it.,9,Big Bang Theory,71,13
44030,Amy,6, Because it's new and weird and I'm just trying to figure it all out. And I knew if I told you guys I had been out with a few people that you'd get way too excited about it.,9,Big Bang Theory,173,38
44033,Penny,6, Amy.,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
44035,Amy,6, It's going fine. It's mostly just been meeting people for coffee.,9,Big Bang Theory,66,11
44036,Raj,6, What? I thought we were all never mind.,9,Big Bang Theory,40,8
44038,Amy,6," Well, I don't have much experience dating, so I decided it would be good for me to, you know, get out there a little.",9,Big Bang Theory,118,24
44039,Penny,6," Well, good for you.",9,Big Bang Theory,20,4
44040,Amy,6, Thank you.,9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
44043,Amy,6, Three.,9,Big Bang Theory,7,1
44046,Sheldon,6," Well, the Swedes might beat us, but at least we won't get gang-noogied in prison.",9,Big Bang Theory,82,15
44047,Leonard,6, Is Ernest Goes to Jail the only prison movie you've seen?,9,Big Bang Theory,58,11
44048,Sheldon,6," It scared me straight, Leonard.",9,Big Bang Theory,32,5
44050,Leonard,6," Thank you, Barry.",9,Big Bang Theory,18,3
44052,Sheldon,6, That's preposterous.,9,Big Bang Theory,21,2
44054,Leonard,6, Can you give us a minute?,9,Big Bang Theory,26,6
44056,Sheldon,6, I don't like being extorted like this. Especially by him of all people.,9,Big Bang Theory,72,13
44057,Leonard,6," Me neither, but what other choice do we have?",9,Big Bang Theory,46,9
44059,Leonard,6, I promise this is the last time.,9,Big Bang Theory,33,7
44061,Leonard,6, It says right here on Wikipedia. A Mexican standoff is a confrontation between at least three parties.,9,Big Bang Theory,103,17
44062,Sheldon,6, How can you trust Wikipedia if they use between to refer to three parties?,9,Big Bang Theory,75,14
44064,Sheldon,6," Or amongst, if they were feeling whimsically archaic.",9,Big Bang Theory,54,8
44066,Sheldon,6, Absolutely. But don't be surprised if this movie sets you on the straight and narrow.,9,Big Bang Theory,86,15
44069,Leonard,7, Did you hear about this study that found people that were cool and popular at 13 have problems succeeding later in life?,9,Big Bang Theory,121,22
44070,Raj,7," Hmm. I'm doing okay, and I was very popular at 13.",9,Big Bang Theory,51,11
44071,Penny,7, In school?,9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
44072,Raj,7," Oh, no. At home. The servants would sing to me, laugh at my jokes. I wish I knew their names.",9,Big Bang Theory,94,20
44073,Penny,7, Does the study say what happens to the unpopular kids?,9,Big Bang Theory,55,10
44074,Leonard,7," You tell me, you woke up in bed with one.",9,Big Bang Theory,42,10
44075,Sheldon,7, Listen to this. I just received an e-mail from Wil Wheaton. Leonard Nimoy's son is working on a documentary that he started with his father before he passed away. It's about Mr. Spock and his impact on our culture.,9,Big Bang Theory,215,39
44076,Leonard,7, Why is he writing to you?,9,Big Bang Theory,26,6
44077,Sheldon,7," Well, they're looking for fans to interview, and Wil thought I'd be good for it.",9,Big Bang Theory,81,15
44078,Raj,7," Oh. Hey, high five.",9,Big Bang Theory,20,4
44079,Sheldon,7," Absolutely not. Yeah, Penny, you spent some time in front of the camera. Any words of advice?",9,Big Bang Theory,94,17
44080,Penny,7, Yes. Don't take your shirt off just because the director said so.,9,Big Bang Theory,66,12
44081,Sheldon,7," This is a documentary about Mr. Spock. I'm sure if there's nudity, it will be tasteful.",9,Big Bang Theory,88,16
44084,Howard,7, Not really. Visigoths are kind of up my butt right now.,9,Big Bang Theory,56,11
44086,Howard,7," Howard? Uh-oh. Make room, Visigoths. â€˜Sup?",9,Big Bang Theory,45,6
44088,Howard,7," Oh, no, not this again.",9,Big Bang Theory,24,5
44090,Howard,7," Oh, honey, of course it's your house. Why else would you be cleaning it all the time?",9,Big Bang Theory,86,17
44092,Howard,7, May I say something?,9,Big Bang Theory,21,4
44094,Howard,7, Never mind.,9,Big Bang Theory,12,2
44096,Sheldon,7," Hello, Amy. It's Sheldon. Yeah, I, I know that we're broken up, but I'm leaving this message because I thought perhaps you'd like to watch me be interviewed for a documentary about Mr. Spock. Or as I like to call it, a Spockumentary. Yeah, I'm going to use that joke in the interview, so try to laugh like you're hearing it for the first time. You know, hysterically, hmm? And with a tinge of sadness that I'm no longer in your life.",9,Big Bang Theory,434,82
44097,Leonard,7, I'm the one who thought of Spockumentary.,9,Big Bang Theory,42,7
44098,Penny,7, And I'm laughing like I did the first time I heard it.,9,Big Bang Theory,55,12
44099,Sheldon,7, Hello.,9,Big Bang Theory,7,1
44102,Sheldon,7," Oh, it's nice to meet you. I admire your father's work very much. It's not every day I get to meet someone whose life's journey began in my hero's scrotum.",9,Big Bang Theory,156,30
44106,Howard,7," Oh. Making myself a bologna sandwich like my mom used to make me after my dad left, but before she died.",9,Big Bang Theory,105,21
44108,Howard,7, I'm listening.,9,Big Bang Theory,15,2
44110,Howard,7, That is reasonable. But what room?,9,Big Bang Theory,35,6
44112,Howard,7," No way. No, this is the room I associate the most with my mom.",9,Big Bang Theory,63,14
44114,Howard,7, I want to change my answer.,9,Big Bang Theory,28,6
44116,Howard,7, I guess we didn't use it very often. Unless we had company. Which didn't happen much after my dad left and not at all after my mom,9,Big Bang Theory,131,27
44120,Sheldon,7, All right. But this better not be some elaborate scheme to get me out of my shirt.,9,Big Bang Theory,83,17
44121,Leonard,7, How long have you known Adam?,9,Big Bang Theory,30,6
44123,Leonard,7, And what are you getting him back for?,9,Big Bang Theory,39,8
44125,Sheldon,7," Dr. Sheldon Cooper, theoretical physicist, Caltech.",9,Big Bang Theory,52,6
44128,Sheldon,7," I think the same thing that appeals to people everywhere, the dream of a cold, rational world entirely without human emotion. Spock came from a planet governed only by logic. You know, on Vulcan, when your brother asks, why are you hitting yourself? the answer is, I'm not. You're moving my arm. To which he says, Fascinating. And then you both watch educational television.",9,Big Bang Theory,375,64
44129,Penny,7," Aw. When he says things like that, I just want to hug him and make everything better.",9,Big Bang Theory,86,17
44130,Leonard,7," My brother was mean to me, too.",9,Big Bang Theory,32,7
44131,Penny,7," Yeah, you probably had it coming.",9,Big Bang Theory,34,6
44133,Sheldon,7, I have many. My most treasured is an autographed napkin given to me by my very thoughtful friend Penny. That's her over there.,9,Big Bang Theory,127,23
44134,Penny,7," Hi. Look at that. I'm in a movie, my shirt stayed on.",9,Big Bang Theory,54,12
44136,Sheldon,7, Of course. Excuse me. This will just take a moment.,9,Big Bang Theory,52,10
44137,Leonard,7, When did we get a wall safe?,9,Big Bang Theory,29,7
44138,Sheldon,7, When there was no more room in the floor safe.,9,Big Bang Theory,47,10
44139,Leonard,7, When did we get a floor safe?,9,Big Bang Theory,30,7
44140,Sheldon,7, When we got the security camera.,9,Big Bang Theory,33,6
44141,Leonard,7, There's a security camera?,9,Big Bang Theory,27,4
44142,Sheldon,7," Aquaman, protecting your home since 2012.",9,Big Bang Theory,42,6
44143,Penny,7," Oh, my God. We've done things on that couch.",9,Big Bang Theory,45,9
44144,Sheldon,7, Yeah. You don't have to tell me.,9,Big Bang Theory,33,7
44146,Raj,7," So, your father-in-law is in there right now?",9,Big Bang Theory,46,8
44147,Howard,7, Yes. So back me up. The house is good the way it is.,9,Big Bang Theory,53,13
44148,Raj,7," Oh, okay. Got it.",9,Big Bang Theory,18,4
44149,Howard,7, Hey. What's going on?,9,Big Bang Theory,22,4
44150,Raj,7, Hey.,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
44152,Raj,7, You sure? It's a pretty great wall.,9,Big Bang Theory,36,7
44154,Raj,7, I'm sorry. I did what I could.,9,Big Bang Theory,31,7
44156,Howard,7, Your dad's on your side.,9,Big Bang Theory,25,5
44158,Raj,7, That is so generous of you. I'd like to switch sides.,9,Big Bang Theory,54,11
44159,Howard,7," Look, uh, I don't even think you can take this wall down 'cause it's load-bearing.",9,Big Bang Theory,83,15
44160,Raj,7," Well, it's easy to find out. Just go into the crawlspace under the house and check.",9,Big Bang Theory,84,16
44161,Howard,7, When is your visa up?,9,Big Bang Theory,22,5
44163,Sheldon,7, Not only is it signed to me but this is where he wiped his mouth. So we are currently in the presence of Leonard Nimoy's DNA.,9,Big Bang Theory,126,26
44165,Sheldon,7," No offence, but this is pure 100% Nimoy. Because of your mother, you're only 50%. Which isn't bad, but anything that you wipe your mouth on gets thrown away.",9,Big Bang Theory,158,29
44166,Penny,7," Okay, enough about the napkin. What else you hiding in there?",9,Big Bang Theory,62,11
44167,Sheldon,7, Wouldn't you like to know?,9,Big Bang Theory,27,5
44168,Penny,7, I would.,9,Big Bang Theory,9,2
44169,Sheldon,7," All right then. See? Just my valuables. My passport, uh, my will.",9,Big Bang Theory,66,12
44170,Leonard,7, You have a will?,9,Big Bang Theory,17,4
44171,Sheldon,7," Yeah. My 1/18 scale Wil Wheaton action figure. I also have the other kind of will, and in it I will my Wil back to Wil.",9,Big Bang Theory,120,26
44172,Leonard,7, Will Wil want it?,9,Big Bang Theory,18,4
44174,Penny,7," Oh, what's that ring box?",9,Big Bang Theory,26,5
44175,Sheldon,7, Oh. That is an engagement ring that I was going to give my girlfriend Amy.,9,Big Bang Theory,75,15
44176,Penny,7, What?,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
44177,Leonard,7, You bought her a ring?,9,Big Bang Theory,23,5
44178,Sheldon,7," No, no. This has been in my family for generations. Except for a short time when Comanches cut off my great-great-great-grandmother's finger and stole it.",9,Big Bang Theory,155,25
44180,Sheldon,7," No. The Texas Rangers tracked them down to their village and slaughtered every last one of them. It was a happy ending. Well, for my nine-fingered Nana.",9,Big Bang Theory,153,27
44181,Penny,7," Okay, back to the ring. Does Amy even know about this?",9,Big Bang Theory,55,11
44182,Sheldon,7, No. She broke up with me before I could broach the subject.,9,Big Bang Theory,60,12
44183,Leonard,7," Oh, man, I'm sorry, that must have been devastating for you.",9,Big Bang Theory,61,11
44184,Sheldon,7," No, not at all. No, I'm fine. You know, Amy had reservations about our relationship, so all worked out for the best.",9,Big Bang Theory,117,22
44185,Penny,7, I know. It just,9,Big Bang Theory,16,4
44186,Sheldon,7," I said I'm fine!  We've gotten a little off-topic. Allow me to make things entertaining again in this little Spockumentary. That was Leonard's joke. As a child, when faced with a dilemma, my mother encouraged me to ask what would Jesus do? The answer to that was always love thy neighbour. But my neighbour had a dead tooth, so that wasn't going to happen. But that's why I changed it to, what would Spock do?",9,Big Bang Theory,410,75
44188,Sheldon,7," Yes. Oh, for example, three years ago when I discovered Penny was eating all my Pop-Tarts, instead of getting angry or vindictive, you know, I got a floor safe.",9,Big Bang Theory,161,29
44189,Penny,7, I knew I could smell 'em.,9,Big Bang Theory,26,6
44191,Sheldon,7," Oh, certainly. Uh, when I was eight years old, Billy Sparks cornered me in the playground. I asked myself what would Spock do? Then I grabbed Billy on his shoulder and performed my first Vulcan nerve pinch.",9,Big Bang Theory,207,37
44193,Sheldon,7," Oh, no, he broke my collarbone. I can still hear it click.",9,Big Bang Theory,59,12
44195,Sheldon,7," Oh, not at all. As I said, the entire point of emulating Spock was to rise above human emotion, which I've spent a lifetime mastering.",9,Big Bang Theory,135,25
44196,Penny,7, Oh pfft.,9,Big Bang Theory,9,2
44197,Sheldon,7, Excuse me?,9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
44198,Penny,7, I'm sorry. I'm not here.,9,Big Bang Theory,25,5
44199,Sheldon,7, No. You went pfft. What does pfft mean?,9,Big Bang Theory,40,8
44200,Penny,7, Um.,9,Big Bang Theory,4,1
44201,Leonard,7, You did go pfft.,9,Big Bang Theory,17,4
44202,Penny,7," All right, fine. Well, Sheldon, I'm no expert, but aren't you completely missing the point of Spock? I mean, he liked to act like he had no emotions, but he was still half human.",9,Big Bang Theory,179,34
44203,Leonard,7, Just like you.,9,Big Bang Theory,15,3
44204,Penny,7," I'm just saying, you pretend you don't, but you have feelings just like everybody else.",9,Big Bang Theory,88,15
44205,Sheldon,7," Not true. No, look at me. I had an engagement ring to give a girl, and instead, she rejected me. And am I emotional about that? No. No, I am sitting here on a couch, talking about my favourite TV character like nothing happened. â€˜Cause I am just like him, all logical, all the time.",9,Big Bang Theory,285,55
44206,Penny,7," Sweetie, you're yelling.",9,Big Bang Theory,25,3
44207,Sheldon,7," Because when I speak at a regular volume, no one seems to believe me that I've put this Amy nonsense behind me.",9,Big Bang Theory,112,22
44211,Howard,7," Yeah. Yeah, I feel like an archaeologist. Indiana Jones and the Single-Family Dwelling. Hey. Look. Found a seashell.",9,Big Bang Theory,117,18
44213,Howard,7, Oh.,9,Big Bang Theory,4,1
44215,Howard,7, Sorry. Do you have a sense of where we are?,9,Big Bang Theory,44,10
44217,Howard,7," Oh. Okay, so we must be under the dining room.",9,Big Bang Theory,47,10
44219,Howard,7, Why wouldn't I want to hear it?,9,Big Bang Theory,32,7
44221,Howard,7," That's not true at all. I wish she'd get pregnant, believe me. I'm climbing on top of her every chance I get. In a loving and respectful manner. The point is, I really do want kids.",9,Big Bang Theory,182,36
44223,Howard,7," I don't know why she's lying to you. She's the one who doesn't want kids. In fact, every time I bring up the subject",9,Big Bang Theory,117,24
44225,Howard,7," Oh, my God, we're gonna die.",9,Big Bang Theory,29,6
44228,Penny,7, I can't believe Sheldon was gonna ask Amy to marry him.,9,Big Bang Theory,56,11
44229,Leonard,7, I know. I also can't believe he watched what we did on that couch and still sits on it.,9,Big Bang Theory,88,19
44230,Penny,7, Yeah.,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
44231,Sheldon,7, Hello.,9,Big Bang Theory,7,1
44232,Leonard,7," Hey, buddy. How you doing?",9,Big Bang Theory,27,5
44233,Sheldon,7, Better. Did Wil and Adam leave?,9,Big Bang Theory,32,6
44234,Leonard,7, Yeah.,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
44235,Sheldon,7, Do you think they're going to put my outburst in the documentary?,9,Big Bang Theory,66,12
44236,Leonard,7," Oh, yeah.",9,Big Bang Theory,10,2
44237,Penny,7, Definitely.,9,Big Bang Theory,12,1
44238,Sheldon,7," Well, there's no point in dwelling on it. As the Vulcans say, Kup-fun-tor ha'kiv na'ish Du stau.",9,Big Bang Theory,97,17
44239,Penny,7, Do you know what that means?,9,Big Bang Theory,29,6
44240,Leonard,7, No.,9,Big Bang Theory,4,1
44241,Penny,7, Are you telling the truth?,9,Big Bang Theory,27,5
44242,Leonard,7, Nirsh.,9,Big Bang Theory,7,1
44243,Sheldon,7," Well, this is ridiculous. Being upset about Amy all the time isn't accomplishing anything. If I want to resolve this situation, then I need to take action.",9,Big Bang Theory,156,27
44244,Penny,7, What are you gonna do?,9,Big Bang Theory,23,5
44245,Sheldon,7," I'm going to find her and ask her to marry me. And if she says yes, we can put this behind us and resume our relationship. And if she says no, well, then she can just ponfo miran.",9,Big Bang Theory,180,38
44246,Leonard,7, He didn't meant that.,9,Big Bang Theory,22,4
44249,Howard,7, That would be nice.,9,Big Bang Theory,20,4
44251,Howard,7, But you were okay throwing me under the bus?,9,Big Bang Theory,45,9
44256,Raj,7," It's interesting your father didn't help around the house and Howard doesn't help, either, so in a way, Howard's not only like your father, but he's also like the child that you're afraid to have.",9,Big Bang Theory,197,35
44257,Howard,7, Why are you still here?,9,Big Bang Theory,24,5
44258,Raj,7," Fine, I'll leave. But it sounds like somebody needs a fresh diaper.",9,Big Bang Theory,68,12
44259,Howard,7," All right, I admit that I don't help out a lot. And I need to work on that. But if we had a kid, it would be different.",9,Big Bang Theory,120,28
44261,Howard,7," Because when my dad left, I promised myself that if I ever had a chance to be a father I'd always be there.",9,Big Bang Theory,108,23
44263,Howard,7," And this an actual I'll think about it, not like the can we get a motorcycle with a sidecar I'll think about itâ€ù?",9,Big Bang Theory,116,23
44265,Howard,7, I really believe I'd be a great dad.,9,Big Bang Theory,37,8
44267,Howard,7," Speaking of making babies, what do you say I wash up and poke around your crawlspace?",9,Big Bang Theory,86,16
44272,Sheldon,7," Yeah, right. You can just shut your feelings off. There goes television, lying to us again. We let you raise our children, and this is the thanks we get. Leonard, how could I have been so foolish to try and follow in the footsteps of a made-up alien race with no emotions?",9,Big Bang Theory,273,52
44273,Leonard,7," Well now instead of idolizing fictional characters, you can focus on the real people who are already in your life.",9,Big Bang Theory,115,20
44274,Sheldon,7, Those are very wise words.,9,Big Bang Theory,27,5
44275,Leonard,7, Thank you.,9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
44276,Sheldon,7, They'd just be so much more comforting if they came out of a television.,9,Big Bang Theory,73,14
44278,Penny,8, I think it's so adorable you're making Sheldon breakfast.,9,Big Bang Theory,58,9
44279,Leonard,8," Well, he's having a rough time. Amy broke his heart, the DVR cut off the last minute of Doctor Who. That crow followed him home.",9,Big Bang Theory,129,25
44280,Penny,8, Aren't you worried you're making French toast on oatmeal day?,9,Big Bang Theory,62,10
44281,Leonard,8," Ah, well, what's this? A pot of oatmeal? Or, thanks to you, what I will now call gloatmeal.",9,Big Bang Theory,92,18
44282,Penny,8," Oh, I don't want credit for that.",9,Big Bang Theory,34,7
44283,Sheldon,8," Oh, Dr. and Mrs. Hofstadter, lovely to see you this fine morning.",9,Big Bang Theory,66,12
44284,Leonard,8, You're in a good mood.,9,Big Bang Theory,23,5
44285,Sheldon,8," Yeah, I am indeed. I have decided, instead of wallowing in sadness about Amy, it is time that I find myself a new female companion.",9,Big Bang Theory,132,25
44286,Penny,8, Oh. Good for you.,9,Big Bang Theory,18,4
44287,Leonard,8, What brought this on?,9,Big Bang Theory,22,4
44288,Sheldon,8," I realized something. When Amy was in my life, I was hyper-focused on my work and ignored her.",9,Big Bang Theory,95,18
44289,Penny,8, And you don't want to make the same mistake with the next woman.,9,Big Bang Theory,65,13
44290,Sheldon,8," No, I need a new woman in my life to ignore so I can hyper-focus on my work again.",9,Big Bang Theory,83,19
44291,Leonard,8," Hey, I made French toast sticks.",9,Big Bang Theory,33,6
44292,Sheldon,8, On oatmeal day?,9,Big Bang Theory,16,3
44293,Leonard,8," Ah, I also made oatmeal.",9,Big Bang Theory,25,5
44294,Sheldon,8," Ooh, that's a lot of carbohydrates for a man on the prowl. You know what? You eat it. You're married, it doesn't matter what you look like.",9,Big Bang Theory,140,27
44295,Penny,8, Don't take advice from a man who threw his shoe at a crow.,9,Big Bang Theory,59,13
44297,Sheldon,8," Thank you for coming by, gentlemen.",9,Big Bang Theory,36,6
44298,Howard,8, No problem.,9,Big Bang Theory,12,2
44299,Raj,8, So what's up?,9,Big Bang Theory,14,3
44300,Sheldon,8," Well, it was the two of you who found Amy Farrah Fowler for me. Now that I'm looking for my next girlfriend, it seemed only logical that I employ your services once again.",9,Big Bang Theory,172,33
44301,Howard,8, You sure you're up for that? She did hurt you.,9,Big Bang Theory,47,10
44302,Sheldon,8," Oh, no, it's all right. I think of my time with Amy as a stick of Fruit Stripe gum. Sweet and enjoyable at first, but ultimately a flavourless lump of sadness.",9,Big Bang Theory,160,31
44303,Raj,8, You're not wrong about Fruit Stripe. I was always a Hubba Bubba man.,9,Big Bang Theory,69,13
44304,Howard,8, Hubba Bubba over Dubble Bubble? You're crazy.,9,Big Bang Theory,46,7
44305,Raj,8," Hey, the jaw wants what it wants.",9,Big Bang Theory,34,7
44306,Sheldon,8, Gentlemen.,9,Big Bang Theory,11,1
44307,Raj,8," Oh, right, uh, girlfriend. Okay.",9,Big Bang Theory,33,5
44308,Howard,8, But what are you looking for?,9,Big Bang Theory,30,6
44309,Sheldon,8," All I'm looking for is an educated, intelligent woman who shares my interests while retaining her own unique point of view. She should be kind, patient, and most important, unable to imagine life without me by ten o'clock tonight.",9,Big Bang Theory,231,39
44310,Howard,8, Isn't that a little unreasonable?,9,Big Bang Theory,34,5
44311,Sheldon,8," All right, fine, she doesn't need her own point of view. Now, chop-chop.",9,Big Bang Theory,73,13
44313,Penny,8," Come on, Amy, show us the dress.",9,Big Bang Theory,33,7
44314,Amy,8, Okay. But I'm really stepping outside of my comfort zone here.,9,Big Bang Theory,63,11
44315,Penny,8," Uh, I don't think any of your comfort zones are showing.",9,Big Bang Theory,57,11
44317,Amy,8," Well, some people think the sexiest organ is the brain.",9,Big Bang Theory,56,10
44318,Penny,8, No one ever bought me drinks at a bar because my brain just popped out of my shirt.,9,Big Bang Theory,84,18
44319,Amy,8, Do you have any heels higher than this? He's pretty tall.,9,Big Bang Theory,58,11
44320,Penny,8, Ooh.,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
44322,Penny,8," Yeah, come on, tell us more.",9,Big Bang Theory,29,6
44323,Amy,8," Well, I told you his name and that he's tall. What more do you need?",9,Big Bang Theory,69,15
44325,Amy,8, Just a little peck on the lips.,9,Big Bang Theory,32,7
44326,Penny,8," Well, we're your best friends, give us one more detail and we promise we'll leave you alone.",9,Big Bang Theory,93,17
44327,Amy,8," Fine. Um, he's British. All right, that is a juicy one.",9,Big Bang Theory,56,11
44328,Penny,8," All right, where is tall British Dave taking you?",9,Big Bang Theory,50,9
44330,Amy,8, To that new Italian place on Walnut.,9,Big Bang Theory,37,7
44332,Amy,8, I'm gonna go look for other shoes.,9,Big Bang Theory,35,7
44333,Penny,8, Good luck. I threw out all my tall ones when I married Leonard.,9,Big Bang Theory,64,13
44335,Penny,8, We don't even know what time they're gonna be there.,9,Big Bang Theory,53,10
44337,Penny,8," Damn, you're sneaky.",9,Big Bang Theory,21,3
44340,Howard,8, I think the quickest way to find you a new girlfriend is just to get you on every dating Web site out there.,9,Big Bang Theory,109,23
44341,Sheldon,8," Are you sure? I've heard that on those sites, often when you think you're corresponding with someone, it's actually a computer program pretending to be a real person.",9,Big Bang Theory,167,28
44342,Raj,8, And you're afraid it'll do a better job than you?,9,Big Bang Theory,50,10
44343,Sheldon,8," Excuse me. No one does a better job pretending to be a person than I do. Siri comes close, but I know more jokes.",9,Big Bang Theory,114,24
44344,Howard,8," If you don't want to use dating Web sites, what do you suggest?",9,Big Bang Theory,64,13
44345,Sheldon,8," Off the top of my head? Uh, prospective women weed themselves out in a battle of wits until only one champion remains, and she shows up at my door flush with the thrill of victory, and then sits quietly by my side while I watch Daredevil.",9,Big Bang Theory,239,46
44346,Howard,8, You seriously think women would fight for you?,9,Big Bang Theory,47,8
44347,Sheldon,8," People compete for jobs and trophies, why not me?",9,Big Bang Theory,50,9
44348,Howard,8," He's right, he knows a lot of jokes.",9,Big Bang Theory,37,8
44349,Raj,8," Yeah, no, but it is basic human nature. If we present him as a prize, maybe they would.",9,Big Bang Theory,88,18
44350,Howard,8," Well, he's smart, he's a respected scientist.",9,Big Bang Theory,46,7
44351,Sheldon,8, And I have the soulful eyes of a cow.,9,Big Bang Theory,38,9
44352,Raj,8, I don't know if I'd say you oh.,9,Big Bang Theory,32,8
44353,Howard,8," I have an idea. What if we put a post on Craigslist that says world-class Caltech physicist seeking girlfriend. If interested, solve the following puzzles for a chance to meet him.",9,Big Bang Theory,181,31
44354,Sheldon,8," Oh, we'll make the puzzles extremely challenging to eliminate unworthy candidates.",9,Big Bang Theory,83,11
44355,Raj,8," Oh, we could set it up like a scavenger hunt where the last puzzle gives the winner Sheldon's contact information.",9,Big Bang Theory,115,20
44356,Howard,8," Well, this is actually an interesting social experiment.",9,Big Bang Theory,57,8
44357,Raj,8, I'm a little jealous of the people who get to do it.,9,Big Bang Theory,53,12
44358,Howard,8," Me, too. And we've seen the prize.",9,Big Bang Theory,35,7
44360,Leonard,8, I don't understand why we're leaving so early for the movie.,9,Big Bang Theory,61,11
44361,Penny,8," Oh, I forgot to tell you, we're gonna meet up with Bernadette to spy on Amy and her date.",9,Big Bang Theory,90,19
44362,Leonard,8, What? I don't want to do that.,9,Big Bang Theory,31,7
44363,Penny,8," What, and you think I want to see a documentary about aluminium can recycling?",9,Big Bang Theory,79,14
44364,Leonard,8, This is the movie that big soda doesn't want you to see.,9,Big Bang Theory,57,12
44365,Penny,8," No, it's the movie your wife doesn't want you to see.",9,Big Bang Theory,54,11
44366,Leonard,8, So you're actually okay with invading your friend's privacy?,9,Big Bang Theory,61,9
44367,Penny,8, You're not curious who she's out with?,9,Big Bang Theory,39,7
44368,Leonard,8, Not really.,9,Big Bang Theory,12,2
44369,Penny,8, But you're curious about aluminium cans? You're a weird little guy.,9,Big Bang Theory,68,11
44371,Sheldon,8, That's it. The Sheldon Cooper Girlfriend Challenge is officially live.,9,Big Bang Theory,71,10
44372,Howard,8, Congratulations.,9,Big Bang Theory,17,1
44373,Raj,8, This is exciting.,9,Big Bang Theory,18,3
44374,Sheldon,8," Right now, somewhere, a woman is dividing the atomic weight of the best noble gas by the number of colours in the oldest national flag still in use.",9,Big Bang Theory,149,28
44375,Howard,8, Then using that number as the average speed to calculate the travel time from Mordor to the Shire.,9,Big Bang Theory,99,18
44376,Sheldon,8," And, taking her first step towards a lifetime of laughter, love and, best of all, rules.",9,Big Bang Theory,89,16
44377,Raj,8," I, I hope we didn't make the puzzles too hard.",9,Big Bang Theory,47,10
44378,Howard,8," Well, if she can solve them, it'll prove she's intelligent, tenacious and so socially awkward she has nothing better to do on a Saturday night.",9,Big Bang Theory,144,25
44379,Sheldon,8," Golly, she sounds too good to be true.",9,Big Bang Theory,39,8
44382,Amy,8," Well, I'm having a good time, too. If you don't mind me asking, why did you and your wife split up?",9,Big Bang Theory,100,21
44384,Amy,8," Oh, I'm, I'm so sorry.",9,Big Bang Theory,23,5
44386,Penny,8," Hey. So, where are they?",9,Big Bang Theory,25,5
44388,Penny,8," Oh, damn it, we should have brought binoculars.",9,Big Bang Theory,48,8
44390,Leonard,8, You just happen to have those in the car?,9,Big Bang Theory,42,9
44392,Leonard,8, By stalking them?,9,Big Bang Theory,18,3
44394,Penny,8," Oh, there he is.",9,Big Bang Theory,17,4
44396,Penny,8, Yeah.,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
44397,Leonard,8, Can I see?,9,Big Bang Theory,11,3
44398,Penny,8," What, now you're interested? You didn't even want to come.",9,Big Bang Theory,59,10
44399,Leonard,8," I know, but you guys make being a crappy friend look fun.",9,Big Bang Theory,58,12
44400,Penny,8, Fine.,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
44401,Leonard,8," Yeah, okay, I see him. It looks like they're having a nice time. I wish I could hear what they're saying.",9,Big Bang Theory,106,21
44403,Penny,8, Your what?,9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
44406,Amy,8," No. I mean, to be completely honest, I've, I've only been in one long-term relationship.",9,Big Bang Theory,89,15
44408,Amy,8," That's a good question. After five years, it was just feeling like more work than it should be.",9,Big Bang Theory,96,18
44410,Amy,8, No. He's a theoretical physicist at Caltech.,9,Big Bang Theory,45,7
44412,Amy,8," Um, used to be string theory, now it's dark matter. But let's not discuss Sheldon. Let's get back to you.",9,Big Bang Theory,106,20
44414,Amy,8, I'm trying not to. Do you know him?,9,Big Bang Theory,36,8
44416,Penny,8, He really seems into her.,9,Big Bang Theory,26,5
44418,Leonard,8," Okay, we saw them. Can we go catch the movie?",9,Big Bang Theory,46,10
44420,Penny,8, I had to; we're married now.,9,Big Bang Theory,29,6
44423,Amy,8," Sure, why not?",9,Big Bang Theory,15,3
44425,Amy,8, Um about an hour and half.,9,Big Bang Theory,27,6
44427,Amy,8, Yes. Yep. We were on a date. Very much like this one.,9,Big Bang Theory,54,12
44429,Amy,8, What was the rest of your question?,9,Big Bang Theory,36,7
44431,Amy,8, Really? You-you want me to introduce you to my ex-boyfriend?,9,Big Bang Theory,61,10
44433,Leonard,8, Are we gonna be much longer? I really have to go to the bathroom.,9,Big Bang Theory,66,14
44436,Raj,8, 37 minutes left until the deadline.,9,Big Bang Theory,36,6
44437,Sheldon,8, Someone will show.,9,Big Bang Theory,19,3
44438,Howard,8," And no matter what happens, this is still a fun experiment.",9,Big Bang Theory,60,11
44439,Raj,8, Not as fun as the night we blew up grapes in the microwave. We really have led full lives.,9,Big Bang Theory,91,19
44440,Sheldon,8, Someone will show.,9,Big Bang Theory,19,3
44441,Raj,8," Maybe you don't want someone exactly like you. You know what they say, opposites attract.",9,Big Bang Theory,90,15
44442,Sheldon,8," Well, by that logic, I should be with someone short, dull and needy, eh? Not to cast aspersions, but I can't shake a stick around here without hitting that.",9,Big Bang Theory,157,29
44445,Amy,8, I have a DVD of that lecture.,9,Big Bang Theory,30,7
44447,Amy,8," Not as a Valentine's present, no.",9,Big Bang Theory,34,6
44449,Amy,8," That's, um, terrific. Listen, I'm, I'm kind of tired. Can we call it a night?",9,Big Bang Theory,78,15
44451,Amy,8," No, you're not.",9,Big Bang Theory,16,3
44453,Amy,8, Thank you.,9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
44456,Penny,8," What? Here, give me, give me. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, they're coming right towards us.",9,Big Bang Theory,87,17
44458,Penny,8," Okay. Well, wait, what about Leonard?",9,Big Bang Theory,38,6
44460,Penny,8," Oh, no.",9,Big Bang Theory,8,2
44462,Amy,8, What are you guys doing here?,9,Big Bang Theory,30,6
44464,Leonard,8, What happened?,9,Big Bang Theory,15,2
44466,Leonard,8, Yeah.,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
44468,Amy,8, No. Pinch me.,9,Big Bang Theory,14,3
44470,Leonard,8," I don't know if you want to do that, I was just, okay, never mind.",9,Big Bang Theory,67,15
44472,Leonard,8, You really should.,9,Big Bang Theory,19,3
44474,Raj,8, Sixty seconds. This is not looking good.,9,Big Bang Theory,41,7
44475,Sheldon,8, One minute is a long time.,9,Big Bang Theory,27,6
44476,Howard,8, I've been telling women that for 20 years.,9,Big Bang Theory,43,8
44477,Raj,8, Forty-five.,9,Big Bang Theory,12,1
44478,Sheldon,8," 45 seconds is plenty of time for a woman to walk through that door and fall in love with me. You know, probably half that if I break out the old cow eyes.",9,Big Bang Theory,155,33
44479,Raj,8, Thirty seconds.,9,Big Bang Theory,16,2
44480,Sheldon,8, Uh-oh. What if it's Jennifer Lawrence?,9,Big Bang Theory,39,6
44481,Howard,8, What?,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
44482,Sheldon,8," Well, that last Hunger Games was not my cup of tea.",9,Big Bang Theory,52,11
44483,Howard,8, You thought she was great in X-Men.,9,Big Bang Theory,36,7
44484,Sheldon,8," Oh, fine, I won't shut my heart to the love of Jennifer Lawrence.",9,Big Bang Theory,66,13
44485,Raj,8," Guys, fifteen seconds.",9,Big Bang Theory,23,3
44486,Howard,8, Maybe she's waiting to show up at the last possible moment.,9,Big Bang Theory,60,11
44487,Sheldon,8," Sounds like a drama queen. Oh, no. It is Jennifer Lawrence.",9,Big Bang Theory,60,11
44488,Raj,8," Five, four, three, two, one. That's too bad.",9,Big Bang Theory,45,8
44489,Howard,8, Maybe we did make the test too difficult.,9,Big Bang Theory,42,8
44490,Raj,8," I don't think it matters. Look, Sheldon, I believe when the time is right for you to meet someone, it'll just happen. Okay? Not because of a test or a Web site, but because  we are the dreamers of dreams.",9,Big Bang Theory,205,40
44491,Howard,8," It's an actual girl, and she's really pretty.",9,Big Bang Theory,46,8
44492,Raj,8, Answer it.,9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
44493,Sheldon,8, All right. Can I help you?,9,Big Bang Theory,27,6
44495,Sheldon,8, Yes.,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
44497,Sheldon,8," Careful, it's addictive.",9,Big Bang Theory,25,3
44499,Sheldon,8," And just like that, you're a Klingon-Sanskrit junkie.",9,Big Bang Theory,54,8
44501,Sheldon,8," I am a bit of a unicorn. Well, you certainly seem like a special lady, uh, but as you know, you missed the deadline, so thanks for playing.",9,Big Bang Theory,140,28
44502,Raj,8, How could you send her away?,9,Big Bang Theory,29,6
44503,Sheldon,8," She was late. And she found atomic spectroscopy boring. Well, I wouldn't coitus her with your genitals.",9,Big Bang Theory,104,17
44506,Amy,8, No problem. I'm really sorry about your car.,9,Big Bang Theory,45,8
44508,Amy,8," Um, listen, you're a really nice guy, but I just, I don't think this is working out.",9,Big Bang Theory,85,17
44510,Amy,8," I'm, I'm really sorry.",9,Big Bang Theory,23,4
44512,Amy,8, There you go.,9,Big Bang Theory,14,3
44514,Amy,8, Sure. Heh.,9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
44516,Amy,8," Okay, get out.",9,Big Bang Theory,15,3
44518,Raj,9, Have you guys seen this feature that lets you talk to Siri without pressing any buttons?,9,Big Bang Theory,89,16
44519,Howard,9, No. How does it work?,9,Big Bang Theory,22,5
44520,Raj,9," You just say, uh, Hey, Siri, what time is it?",9,Big Bang Theory,46,10
44521,Howard,9," So now anyone can control your phone? Hey, Siri, show me pictures of naked grandma butts.",9,Big Bang Theory,90,16
44522,Raj,9, Nice try. It only recognizes my voice.,9,Big Bang Theory,39,7
44523,Howard,9," Oh. Cool.  Hey, Siri, show me pictures of naked grandma butts.",9,Big Bang Theory,63,11
44524,Raj,9, I don't sound like that.,9,Big Bang Theory,25,5
44526,Sheldon,9," Hey. Good news, everybody. Now that I'm no longer with Amy, I have an extra ticket to the annual Thanksgiving lunch buffet at the aquarium cafeteria. Who wants it? Well, you realize you won't be going alone, I'll be there the whole time. Providing fish and pilgrim facts. Can you people hear me?",9,Big Bang Theory,296,53
44527,Leonard,9," Well, we're having everyone over.",9,Big Bang Theory,34,5
44528,Penny,9," Yeah, Leonard and I are gonna be cooking all day.",9,Big Bang Theory,50,10
44529,Leonard,9, Otherwise we'd love to.,9,Big Bang Theory,24,4
44530,Penny,9, But we can't.,9,Big Bang Theory,14,3
44531,Leonard,9," Yeah, poor us.",9,Big Bang Theory,15,3
44532,Penny,9, Mm-hmm.,9,Big Bang Theory,8,1
44534,Sheldon,9," Well, Howard, what about you?",9,Big Bang Theory,30,5
44535,Howard,9," Oh, I can't. I'm going to the soup kitchen, too.",9,Big Bang Theory,49,10
44537,Howard,9," If you can't support me when I'm lying, why are we married?",9,Big Bang Theory,60,12
44539,Amy,9," Hi, Sheldon. What's up?",9,Big Bang Theory,24,4
44540,Sheldon,9," Well, I'm calling because Thanksgiving is coming up, and I wanted to offer you the aquarium tickets.",9,Big Bang Theory,101,17
44541,Amy,9, No one can go with you?,9,Big Bang Theory,24,6
44542,Sheldon,9," No. They'd rather spend the holiday with each other than find out of this is the year I finally touch a starfish. Anyway, I wouldn't want the tickets to go to waste, so take whomever you'd like.",9,Big Bang Theory,195,37
44543,Amy,9, Oh. Okay. Thank you.,9,Big Bang Theory,21,4
44544,Sheldon,9, And feel free to tell your guest that the Myanmar catfish is also known as the pilgrim fish. In case the turkey's dry and you need something juicy.,9,Big Bang Theory,148,28
44545,Amy,9," Sheldon, I can tell you want to go, so if you'd be comfortable with it, maybe we could go as friends.",9,Big Bang Theory,102,21
44546,Sheldon,9, You don't think that will be awkward?,9,Big Bang Theory,38,7
44547,Amy,9," Well it is Thanksgiving in an aquarium cafeteria, so I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say yes. But if you mean between us, I think it'll be fine.",9,Big Bang Theory,149,31
44548,Sheldon,9," Very well, then. I'll see you on Thanksgiving morning.",9,Big Bang Theory,55,9
44549,Amy,9, See you then.,9,Big Bang Theory,14,3
44550,Sheldon,9," Oh, and forget what I said about the Myanmar catfish. My list of marine-themed pilgrim facts is pretty short.",9,Big Bang Theory,110,19
44551,Amy,9, Did you know they served shellfish and eel at the very first Thanksgiving?,9,Big Bang Theory,75,13
44552,Sheldon,9, And there goes my list.,9,Big Bang Theory,24,5
44556,Howard,9," Six hours? Oh, God, I don't want to complain for that long.",9,Big Bang Theory,60,12
44557,Raj,9, Do you ever do anything for anyone else?,9,Big Bang Theory,41,8
44558,Howard,9, I happen to be a giving and generous lover.,9,Big Bang Theory,44,9
44565,Howard,9, Maybe I'm happy that so many people turned up to help the less fortunate.,9,Big Bang Theory,74,14
44570,Howard,9, Wipe that smug smile off your face.,9,Big Bang Theory,36,7
44573,Penny,9, Look at us. Our first Thanksgiving as husband and wife.,9,Big Bang Theory,56,10
44574,Leonard,9, I know. I feel so grown up.,9,Big Bang Theory,28,7
44575,Penny,9," Sweetie, you are grown up.",9,Big Bang Theory,27,5
44576,Leonard,9," Really? How many grown-ups do you know who have Mr. Spock oven mitts? Hey, the recipes are on my iPad. Will you pull 'em up?",9,Big Bang Theory,125,25
44577,Penny,9, Yep. What's the code?,9,Big Bang Theory,22,4
44578,Leonard,9, My birthday.,9,Big Bang Theory,13,2
44579,Penny,9, It's not working.,9,Big Bang Theory,18,3
44580,Leonard,9," It's just the four digits, month and day.",9,Big Bang Theory,42,8
44581,Penny,9, Nope.,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
44582,Leonard,9," Let me see. Yeah, there. What number were you putting in?",9,Big Bang Theory,58,11
44583,Penny,9, Uh.,9,Big Bang Theory,4,1
44584,Leonard,9," You don't know my birthday, do you?",9,Big Bang Theory,36,7
44585,Penny,9," Yes, I do.",9,Big Bang Theory,11,3
44586,Leonard,9," Well, what is it?",9,Big Bang Theory,18,4
44587,Penny,9, May.,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
44588,Leonard,9, May what?,9,Big Bang Theory,10,2
44589,Penny,9, I'm not gonna say your password out loud. That is not secure.,9,Big Bang Theory,62,12
44590,Leonard,9, You don't know your own husband's birthday.,9,Big Bang Theory,44,7
44591,Penny,9," Well, you don't know everything about me.",9,Big Bang Theory,42,7
44592,Leonard,9," Your birthday is December 2, you grew up on Perkins Street, the last four digits of your social are 7 6-2 1, and the odds of me letting you forget this are zero.",9,Big Bang Theory,162,33
44593,Penny,9," Oh, look at us. Our last Thanksgiving as husband and wife.",9,Big Bang Theory,59,11
44595,Sheldon,9, Hello.,9,Big Bang Theory,7,1
44596,Amy,9, Hi. Ready for the aquarium?,9,Big Bang Theory,28,5
44597,Sheldon,9," I am. You know, and in an effort to reduce awkwardness as we learn how to function as friends, I printed out a list of safe topics for polite conversation.",9,Big Bang Theory,156,30
44598,Amy,9, If that makes you more comfortable.,9,Big Bang Theory,36,6
44599,Sheldon,9," If there were a list of things that make me more comfortable, lists would be on the top of that list. Okay, now, oh, since last we spoke, have you acquired any pets?",9,Big Bang Theory,166,33
44600,Amy,9, No. You?,9,Big Bang Theory,9,2
44601,Sheldon,9," No. Um, since last we spoke, have you planned or gone on any vacations?",9,Big Bang Theory,72,14
44602,Amy,9, I might go visit my aunt next week.,9,Big Bang Theory,36,8
44603,Sheldon,9, Mm. Your aunt in Modesto?,9,Big Bang Theory,26,5
44604,Amy,9," No, the one in Bakersfield.",9,Big Bang Theory,28,5
44605,Sheldon,9, Bakersfield. I see. Where has this list been all my life?,9,Big Bang Theory,58,11
44608,Howard,9, So we don't even get to be up front where the action is?,9,Big Bang Theory,57,13
44610,Howard,9," I don't know. I was hoping some poor kid would come up to me and say, please, sir, I want some more.",9,Big Bang Theory,101,22
44611,Raj,9," You're in a soup kitchen, not a production of Oliver!",9,Big Bang Theory,54,10
44612,Howard,9, It's not like I'm expecting them to sing.,9,Big Bang Theory,42,8
44614,Sheldon,9," and then the next day was 73 degrees, and the day after that was 72, and then it was 72 again, uh, then it was 74, and that brings us to today, at I'd wear shorts if I had a pair. 78.",9,Big Bang Theory,184,42
44615,Amy,9, Are we done discussing the weather?,9,Big Bang Theory,36,6
44616,Sheldon,9," I don't know if I'd call it discussing. You kind of sat back and let me do all the work. Let's see, what's next on the list. Oh, uh, do you whittle, and if so, what kind of knife do you use.",9,Big Bang Theory,191,42
44617,Amy,9, Sheldon. We've known each other a long time. We are perfectly capable of having a conversation without relying on a list off the Internet.,9,Big Bang Theory,139,24
44618,Sheldon,9," All right. Well, what should we talk about?",9,Big Bang Theory,44,8
44619,Amy,9, I don't know. Just ask me whatever comes to mind.,9,Big Bang Theory,50,10
44620,Sheldon,9, Very well. I know you've been seeing other men. Have you had coitus with any of them?,9,Big Bang Theory,86,17
44621,Amy,9," Man, I walked right into that one.",9,Big Bang Theory,35,7
44623,Leonard,9," Next we need a teaspoon of pepper, which, I believe, was also the name of your childhood dog.",9,Big Bang Theory,94,18
44624,Penny,9, Fine. You think you know so much. Who's my favourite Spice Girl?,9,Big Bang Theory,65,12
44625,Leonard,9, Baby.,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
44626,Penny,9, Who's my favorite member of NSYNC?,9,Big Bang Theory,35,6
44627,Leonard,9, Justin.,9,Big Bang Theory,8,1
44628,Penny,9, Who's my favorite Backstreet Boy?,9,Big Bang Theory,34,5
44629,Leonard,9, Nice try. NSYNC forever.,9,Big Bang Theory,25,4
44630,Penny,9, Damn it.,9,Big Bang Theory,9,2
44631,Leonard,9," Face it, you can't stump me. I am the king of husbands. I know that you don't like the lingerie that I got you on Valentine's Day. I know you hate the word moist. I know",9,Big Bang Theory,170,36
44632,Penny,9," Hang on. Wait, wait. Why don't I like the lingerie you got me?",9,Big Bang Theory,63,13
44633,Leonard,9, Because it's orange and you think it makes you look like a slutty carrot.,9,Big Bang Theory,74,14
44634,Penny,9, Interesting. I never told you that.,9,Big Bang Theory,36,6
44635,Leonard,9, Sure you did.,9,Big Bang Theory,14,3
44636,Penny,9, No. I never told anyone that. But I did write it in my journal.,9,Big Bang Theory,64,14
44637,Leonard,9, What? I didn't know you had a journal.,9,Big Bang Theory,39,8
44638,Penny,9, I also know your voice gets higher when you're lying.,9,Big Bang Theory,54,10
44639,Leonard,9," No, it doesn't.",9,Big Bang Theory,16,3
44641,Raj,9," You know, this reminds me of high school.",9,Big Bang Theory,42,8
44643,Raj,9," No, I was in India, it was humid and smelled funny.",9,Big Bang Theory,52,11
44644,Howard,9," All right, I think I'm getting into a groove here. This isn't so bad.",9,Big Bang Theory,70,14
44646,Howard,9, We've only been doing this 20 minutes?,9,Big Bang Theory,39,7
44647,Raj,9," You know, I read that washing dishes can be an excellent form of meditation. The key is that while washing the dishes one should only be washing the dishes.",9,Big Bang Theory,157,29
44648,Howard,9, Just because you have that accent doesn't mean what you say isn't stupid.,9,Big Bang Theory,74,13
44649,Raj,9," No, seriously. It's about being present in the moment, focusing on the feeling of the warm water, the smell of the detergent, the sound of the dishes squeaking, and following your own breath. It's about, it's about simply being.",9,Big Bang Theory,229,39
44650,Howard,9," Huh. Okay, I'll try it.",9,Big Bang Theory,24,5
44653,Raj,9, Me.,9,Big Bang Theory,4,1
44655,Howard,9," No fair, I was meditating.",9,Big Bang Theory,27,5
44657,Leonard,9," Come on, don't be mad. It was a long time ago, and it was an accident.",9,Big Bang Theory,71,16
44658,Penny,9, How can reading my journal be an accident?,9,Big Bang Theory,43,8
44659,Leonard,9, I didn't even know what it was. I saw it on your nightstand. I picked it up.,9,Big Bang Theory,77,17
44660,Penny,9," Well, when you realized what it was, why didn't you stop?",9,Big Bang Theory,58,11
44661,Leonard,9," You know me, I'm a big ol' bookworm.",9,Big Bang Theory,37,8
44662,Penny,9, All right. Let's just finish cooking.,9,Big Bang Theory,38,6
44663,Leonard,9," Well, hey, okay. Let me make this up to you. Sometimes I keep an online journal. I want you to read something that I wrote.",9,Big Bang Theory,124,25
44664,Penny,9," Okay, really, I'm fine.",9,Big Bang Theory,24,4
44665,Leonard,9," Okay. Well, then I'll read it to you. It's from the day we first met. Beauty, thy name is Penny.",9,Big Bang Theory,97,20
44666,Penny,9," Oh, God. Stop. I don't want you to read something you think'll just butter me up. I want to hear the most recent thing you wrote.",9,Big Bang Theory,130,26
44667,Leonard,9," Fine. Mmm, Penny's beauty, like our love, grows more with each passing day.â€ù",9,Big Bang Theory,79,13
44668,Penny,9, Does it really say that?,9,Big Bang Theory,25,5
44669,Leonard,9, Why would I lie?,9,Big Bang Theory,17,4
44670,Penny,9, OMG. OMG. We're so close to the new Star Wars. I can't take it. Gah. Gah?,9,Big Bang Theory,74,16
44671,Leonard,9," Well, you didn't read it right. The new Star Wars is coming. Gah.",9,Big Bang Theory,66,13
44673,Sheldon,9, I'm sensing things have gotten awkward.,9,Big Bang Theory,40,6
44674,Amy,9," No. It's okay. If we're friends, we should be able to talk about anything.",9,Big Bang Theory,75,14
44675,Sheldon,9, All right.,9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
44676,Amy,9," So, you had some questions about me seeing other people.",9,Big Bang Theory,57,10
44677,Sheldon,9, Just a few.,9,Big Bang Theory,12,3
44678,Amy,9, Go ahead.,9,Big Bang Theory,10,2
44679,Sheldon,9, How many dates have you been on? Who were they with? Where'd you go? Where did you meet them? Did you sleep with them? And how much longer to the aquarium? I'm getting kind of hungry.,9,Big Bang Theory,184,36
44680,Amy,9, Let's see. I have been on six dates with three different people. It was either for coffee or dinner. One I met at a bookstore and two I met online. I haven't slept with anyone. The aquarium is 40 minutes away. And there's a baggie of Cheerios for you in the glove compartment.,9,Big Bang Theory,277,53
44681,Sheldon,9, Is that regular or honey nut?,9,Big Bang Theory,30,6
44682,Amy,9, I mixed them.,9,Big Bang Theory,14,3
44683,Sheldon,9, You mixed them. No wonder gentleman callers are pounding down your door. Do you have any questions for me?,9,Big Bang Theory,107,19
44684,Amy,9, Just one. Are you doing okay?,9,Big Bang Theory,30,6
44685,Sheldon,9, I am.,9,Big Bang Theory,6,2
44686,Amy,9, Good. I want you to be happy.,9,Big Bang Theory,30,7
44687,Sheldon,9, I believe you. I'd believe you more if you threw a few Apple Jacks in here.,9,Big Bang Theory,76,16
44690,Howard,9, Thanks. You got to be kidding me.,9,Big Bang Theory,34,7
44692,Howard,9," Y, you're Elon Musk.",9,Big Bang Theory,21,4
44694,Howard,9," Wh, what are you doing here?",9,Big Bang Theory,29,6
44696,Howard,9," Oh, man. I, what an honour to meet you. I'm, I'm such a fan of Tesla and SpaceX. All your companies. Howard Wolowitz, Caltech.",9,Big Bang Theory,127,24
44698,Howard,9," Oh, yeah. Nothing better than helping people. Which is something I realized when I was viewing Earth from the deck of the International Space Station, where I spent two months as a payload specialist, a job I was qualified for because I'm an MIT-trained engineer.",9,Big Bang Theory,264,45
44700,Howard,9," Sorry. It's just, you're you, you know? And I really want you to adopt me.",9,Big Bang Theory,75,15
44702,Howard,9," Oh. I made my wife come down, too.",9,Big Bang Theory,35,8
44704,Howard,9, Is that a job offer? â€˜Cause I really want to go to Mars. Assuming I can bring my wife. She hardly takes up any room. She's basically a carry-on.,9,Big Bang Theory,147,29
44706,Howard,9, Thank you.,9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
44708,Howard,9," A partially eaten piece of pumpkin pie from a homeless shelter? With Elon Musk, you bet I do.",9,Big Bang Theory,94,18
44710,Sheldon,9," You know, for a Thanksgiving buffet in an aquarium cafeteria, that was really bad.",9,Big Bang Theory,83,14
44711,Amy,9, You're just upset 'cause they ran out of Pilgrim hats.,9,Big Bang Theory,55,10
44712,Sheldon,9, They gave one to that baby. He wasn't even awake.,9,Big Bang Theory,50,10
44713,Amy,9," Well, it wouldn't be a holiday without you being mad at a baby.",9,Big Bang Theory,64,13
44714,Sheldon,9, Oh. Would you care to play an ocean-themed game I invented?,9,Big Bang Theory,60,11
44715,Amy,9, Sure. What is it?,9,Big Bang Theory,18,4
44716,Sheldon,9," It's called Food, Friend, Fight. One of us chooses three aquatic creatures, and the other one must decide which he would eat, befriend, or battle.",9,Big Bang Theory,147,25
44717,Amy,9," So it's like Kiss, Marry, Kill.",9,Big Bang Theory,32,6
44718,Sheldon,9, What is that?,9,Big Bang Theory,14,3
44719,Amy,9," It's a game where you're given three people and you choose which one you'd kiss, marry, or kill.",9,Big Bang Theory,97,18
44720,Sheldon,9," Well, my game is better, 'cause instead of marrying someone, you get to eat them.",9,Big Bang Theory,82,15
44721,Amy,9, Let's just play.,9,Big Bang Theory,17,3
44722,Sheldon,9," I'll start you off easy. Electric eel, pufferfish, shrimp.",9,Big Bang Theory,59,9
44723,Amy,9," Hmm. Well, I wouldn't fight the eel, because I know it can generate enough current to kill a horse. So I'd eat the eel, fight the shrimp, and befriend the pufferfish, because it would be nice to have company on those days I feel bloated.",9,Big Bang Theory,238,45
44724,Sheldon,9, Very well done.,9,Big Bang Theory,16,3
44725,Amy,9," Thank you. Okay, your turn. Hmm. Seal, hagfish, SpongeBob SquarePants.",9,Big Bang Theory,71,10
44726,Sheldon,9," Well, I'd befriend SpongeBob but he's not real, so I can't do that, can I?",9,Big Bang Theory,75,15
44727,Amy,9, But you can pal around with a hagfish?,9,Big Bang Theory,39,8
44728,Sheldon,9," Hey, let's not pull at that thread. Okay. I'll fight SpongeBob, because he's so friendly we'll just end up tickling each other. Um, I'll befriend the seal, because he's trainable, which is the problem I'm having with my current friends. Which means I'll have to eat the hagfish.",9,Big Bang Theory,279,48
44729,Amy,9," Isn't that gross? I mean, a hagfish can produce enough mucus to fill a bucket in a minute.",9,Big Bang Theory,91,18
44730,Sheldon,9," I know. It makes its own gravy, it'll slide right down.",9,Big Bang Theory,56,11
44731,Amy,9, I miss this.,9,Big Bang Theory,13,3
44732,Sheldon,9," How can you miss a game you've never played before, silly?",9,Big Bang Theory,59,11
44733,Amy,9, I guess sometimes I'm silly.,9,Big Bang Theory,29,5
44735,Penny,9, Hey. Where'd you go? I can't tell if the turkey's done.,9,Big Bang Theory,56,11
44736,Leonard,9," Be right there. Hi, lover.",9,Big Bang Theory,27,5
44737,Penny,9, What are you doing?,9,Big Bang Theory,20,4
44738,Leonard,9, I'm sorry about the journal. I want to make it up to you. So I'm gonna let you post a shame photo of me on Facebook.,9,Big Bang Theory,117,26
44739,Penny,9, I am not putting that on the Internet. I don't want people to see this. I don't want to see it.,9,Big Bang Theory,96,21
44740,Leonard,9," Don't want people to see what, huh? A little bit of this?",9,Big Bang Theory,58,12
44741,Penny,9, Oh.,9,Big Bang Theory,4,1
44742,Leonard,9," Huh? Some of this? And, since it's Thanksgiving, an extra helping of this?",9,Big Bang Theory,75,13
44745,Leonard,9, I'm glad you had a nice time with Amy.,9,Big Bang Theory,39,9
44746,Sheldon,9," Me, too. It's comforting to know that she and I are able to function as friends.",9,Big Bang Theory,81,16
44747,Penny,9," Well, I've never been friends with any of my exes.",9,Big Bang Theory,51,10
44748,Sheldon,9," Oh, I'm sure you and Leonard will be able to pull it off.  Oh. It's my friend Amy. Hello.",9,Big Bang Theory,90,19
44749,Amy,9," Hi, Sheldon. I'm just driving home from my mother's.",9,Big Bang Theory,53,9
44750,Sheldon,9, Did you have a nice time?,9,Big Bang Theory,26,6
44751,Amy,9," I did. Um, listen, I really enjoyed spending this morning with you.",9,Big Bang Theory,68,12
44752,Sheldon,9," Well, I can't take all the credit. It was pretty funny when that one anchovy started going the wrong way.",9,Big Bang Theory,106,20
44753,Amy,9," It was. Uh, listen, I, I was thinking that, um, maybe I'm ready to be your girlfriend again.",9,Big Bang Theory,93,18
44754,Sheldon,9, Oh. I thought we were just friends.,9,Big Bang Theory,36,7
44755,Amy,9," We are. But I was hoping, maybe",9,Big Bang Theory,32,7
44756,Sheldon,9," Amy, I excel at many things, but getting over you wasn't one of them. I think I need to just be your friend.",9,Big Bang Theory,109,23
44757,Amy,9, Okay. I understand.,9,Big Bang Theory,20,3
44758,Sheldon,9," Good. Oh, I watched a video of the hagfish producing mucus, so I'm gonna change my answer and eat SpongeBob.",9,Big Bang Theory,109,20
44759,Amy,9, Okay. Sure.,9,Big Bang Theory,12,2
44762,Leonard,10, Since when do you hum songs?,9,Big Bang Theory,29,6
44763,Sheldon,10, What are you talking about?,9,Big Bang Theory,28,5
44764,Leonard,10, You were just humming.,9,Big Bang Theory,23,4
44765,Sheldon,10," Are you sure? Sometimes when my brain really gets moving, it makes noise.",9,Big Bang Theory,74,13
44766,Leonard,10, How does your brain feel about calculating the surface tension of the domain walls?,9,Big Bang Theory,84,14
44767,Sheldon,10," Let's see. Hey, I was humming. One point for Hufflepuff. What song is that?",9,Big Bang Theory,76,14
44768,Leonard,10," Well, hum it again. Is that the SpongeBob song?",9,Big Bang Theory,48,9
44769,Sheldon,10, Who lives in a pineapple. Nope.,9,Big Bang Theory,32,6
44770,Leonard,10, Whatever. Can we just get back to this?,9,Big Bang Theory,40,8
44771,Sheldon,10," I feel like I know what song that is, but I can't put my finger on it.  My country, 'tis of thee. No.",9,Big Bang Theory,102,23
44772,Leonard,10, It's just an earworm. It'll come to you.,9,Big Bang Theory,41,8
44773,Sheldon,10, Okay.  R-E-S-P-E-C-T. No.,9,Big Bang Theory,26,3
44774,Leonard,10, Is this what we're doing the rest of the night?,9,Big Bang Theory,48,10
44775,Sheldon,10, I'm surprised you have to ask.,9,Big Bang Theory,31,6
44777,Sheldon,10," Hello, yes, I was hoping you could help me. What song is this? La, la, la, la, la, la, la. You don't know? Well, how dare you call yourselves a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame? My goodness. Do you sing along to the greatest hits of Elvis Presley with that mouth? Well, they were no help at all.",9,Big Bang Theory,290,59
44778,Leonard,10," Which is crazy, since rock and roll is all about good customer service.",9,Big Bang Theory,72,13
44779,Penny,10, Yeah. So you have a song stuck in your head. It happens to everybody.,9,Big Bang Theory,70,14
44780,Sheldon,10," Well, I'm not everybody. I have an eidetic memory. I should be able to remember what song this is, but I can't. Something's wrong with me.",9,Big Bang Theory,139,26
44781,Penny,10," I told you if we were patient, he'd figure it out for himself.",9,Big Bang Theory,63,13
44782,Sheldon,10," I was always afraid this day would come. This might be the first step of my descent into madness, where I gradually test the limits of public nudity.",9,Big Bang Theory,150,28
44783,Penny,10, Public nudity?,9,Big Bang Theory,15,2
44784,Leonard,10," Eh, that just means going barefoot.",9,Big Bang Theory,36,6
44787,Amy,10," Hi, Dave. Uh, it's Amy.",9,Big Bang Theory,24,5
44789,Amy,10, I'm fine. How are you?,9,Big Bang Theory,23,5
44791,Amy,10," Yeah, well, we both made mistakes, you know. I took the last breadstick, you gushed over my ex-boyfriend like he was Leonard Nimoy and you were my ex-boyfriend.",9,Big Bang Theory,161,28
44793,Amy,10," Well, I was wondering if you'd like to get dinner again sometime.",9,Big Bang Theory,66,12
44795,Amy,10, Great.,9,Big Bang Theory,7,1
44797,Amy,10, How 'bout Saturday?,9,Big Bang Theory,20,3
44800,Raj,10," Oh. Did you know, at the United Nations, there's a Department for Outer Space Affairs?",9,Big Bang Theory,87,15
44801,Howard,10, Really? Why?,9,Big Bang Theory,13,2
44802,Raj,10, They exist in case we ever make contact with an alien civilization.,9,Big Bang Theory,68,12
44803,Howard,10," Mm, boy, that's one of those jobs that's boring, boring, boring, then, oh, God, where's the memo with what we do now?",9,Big Bang Theory,118,22
44804,Raj,10," Oh, this is cool. So, a few weeks ago I set up a fan page on Facebook for our band and",9,Big Bang Theory,87,21
44805,Howard,10, Wait a second. How could you do that without consulting me?,9,Big Bang Theory,60,11
44806,Raj,10," It's not a big deal. It just took, like, five minutes to set up.",9,Big Bang Theory,65,14
44807,Howard,10," That's not the point. When we created Footprints on the Moon, we agreed that every band decision would be mutual. Now you're just trying to take over the whole thing. You know, maybe I should go solo.",9,Big Bang Theory,201,37
44808,Raj,10, But someone joined our page. We have an actual fan.,9,Big Bang Theory,52,10
44809,Howard,10," All right. This thing's bigger than you and me, band's back together.",9,Big Bang Theory,70,12
44810,Raj,10," So, listen to what he wrote. Uh, I saw you play at the comic book store. You guys rock. And then there's an animated smiley face raising the roof like this.",9,Big Bang Theory,157,31
44811,Howard,10, We did raise the roof that night.,9,Big Bang Theory,34,7
44812,Raj,10," Yeah, we totally did.",9,Big Bang Theory,22,4
44813,Howard,10, Why do rock stars do drugs when this feels so great?,9,Big Bang Theory,53,11
44815,Sheldon,10, Why can't I recall this song? This is taking far too long. The urge to bang my head against the wall again and again and again and again and again is strong.,9,Big Bang Theory,158,32
44816,Leonard,10, Put on some headphones.,9,Big Bang Theory,24,4
44817,Sheldon,10, No they make my earlobes sweat.,9,Big Bang Theory,32,6
44818,Penny,10," Hey, sweetie, why don't you take a break and do something else for a while?",9,Big Bang Theory,76,15
44819,Sheldon,10, There was a project I've been thinking about starting.,9,Big Bang Theory,55,9
44820,Penny,10," Okay, great. What is it?",9,Big Bang Theory,25,5
44821,Sheldon,10," I'll show you.  Dear Crazy Future Sheldon, you were driven mad by an earworm. Your mind, once your most trusted asset, is now a sack of parrots and monkeys. So, I'm going to tell you everything you need to know. Uh, first, music is dangerous. The movie Footloose tried to warn us, but we wouldn't listen. Oh, wait.  Everyody cut footloose. Nope.",9,Big Bang Theory,346,62
44822,Penny,10, I'll pay a thousand dollars to watch you cut footloose.,9,Big Bang Theory,56,10
44823,Sheldon,10," This is Penny. She is your friend. If she offers you food, it's safe to take it. You probably paid for it, anyway.",9,Big Bang Theory,115,23
44826,Amy,10, Why not? He's actually a very nice guy.,9,Big Bang Theory,40,8
44828,Amy,10," That's nothing Sheldon hasn't done before. Dave's just a big fan of his work. Besides, he said he wouldn't bring it up again.",9,Big Bang Theory,126,23
44830,Amy,10," Oh, he's coming here. I'm actually making dinner.",9,Big Bang Theory,50,8
44832,Amy,10, It is?,9,Big Bang Theory,7,2
44834,Amy,10," You know what? Good. I tried to get back together with Sheldon, he shot me down. Dave likes me. Maybe intimate is what I need.",9,Big Bang Theory,127,25
44836,Amy,10, Why not?,9,Big Bang Theory,9,2
44839,Raj,10, Maybe we should post a comment back to our fan and thank him.,9,Big Bang Theory,62,13
44840,Howard,10, What should we write?,9,Big Bang Theory,22,4
44841,Raj,10," How about, uh, oh, how about, we might be Footprints on the Moon, but your kind words sent us over the moon.",9,Big Bang Theory,109,22
44842,Howard,10, Someday you're gonna make an amazing grandma.,9,Big Bang Theory,46,7
44843,Raj,10, Well what do you want to write?,9,Big Bang Theory,32,7
44844,Howard,10," Something badass, you know, like, thanks for diggin' our vibe. We'll keep rockin' if you keep rollin'.",9,Big Bang Theory,103,17
44845,Raj,10," Dude, if I was wearing a bra, I'd throw it at your head right now.",9,Big Bang Theory,67,15
44846,Howard,10, I'll keep rockin'. You don't do that.,9,Big Bang Theory,38,7
44847,Raj,10, Okay. I posted it.,9,Big Bang Theory,19,4
44848,Howard,10," So, who is this guy?",9,Big Bang Theory,21,5
44849,Raj,10," Let's see. Uh, his name is Trent Monaco.",9,Big Bang Theory,41,8
44850,Howard,10, Cool name.,9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
44851,Raj,10," Yeah. He's 24. He's a deejay. He brews his own beer. He's got awesome tattoos. Dude, he's got a hot girlfriend, too.",9,Big Bang Theory,117,22
44852,Howard,10," Damn. I don't know if he's our biggest fan or I'm his. Hey, Trent just liked our comment.",9,Big Bang Theory,90,18
44853,Raj,10," He is so cool. Hey, no hard feelings, but I'm throwing my hypothetical bra at him.",9,Big Bang Theory,83,16
44855,Penny,10," Oh, my God, he won't stop.",9,Big Bang Theory,27,6
44856,Leonard,10, How does he keep coming up with new ways to be annoying?,9,Big Bang Theory,57,12
44857,Penny,10, Nobody knows. That's why he's number one. Can you please go talk to him?,9,Big Bang Theory,73,14
44858,Leonard,10, Come on. I take care of him all day long. You do it for once.,9,Big Bang Theory,62,15
44859,Penny,10, Once? Who got the gum out of his hair?,9,Big Bang Theory,39,9
44860,Leonard,10," What do you want, a medal? It was your gum.",9,Big Bang Theory,44,10
44861,Penny,10, Fine.,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
44862,Leonard,10, I love you.,9,Big Bang Theory,12,3
44863,Penny,10, Who cares?,9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
44864,Sheldon,10, What are you doing in my room? Stop it. That's mine. Why are you so strong?,9,Big Bang Theory,76,16
44865,Penny,10, Problem solved.,9,Big Bang Theory,16,2
44866,Leonard,10," Oh, yeah, he got a tuba.",9,Big Bang Theory,25,6
44868,Sheldon,10," Dear Crazy Future Sheldon, this is a thermostat. It controls the temperature of the apartment. The ideal setting is 72 degrees. If you find this too cold, then put on a jacket. A straitjacket, 'cause 72's the best and you're crazy. Now, this is your spot. You're very protective of it. When anyone else tries to sit here, you berate them relentlessly. It sounds mean, but somehow you make it adorable. People are also delighted by your love of pranks. For example, Leonard has no idea what I did to his coffee. It wasn't replace it with Folger's crystals, I'll tell you that much.",9,Big Bang Theory,581,104
44869,Leonard,10," Hey, can we please get back to work?",9,Big Bang Theory,37,8
44870,Sheldon,10, This is Leonard. He's your best friend in the world.,9,Big Bang Theory,53,10
44871,Leonard,10," All right, just stop. This is ridiculous.",9,Big Bang Theory,42,7
44872,Sheldon,10," Sometimes he gets cranky, but you can trust him with your life. And he does more things for you than I can even begin to list.",9,Big Bang Theory,127,26
44873,Leonard,10, Thank you.,9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
44874,Sheldon,10," Oh, no, he's drinking it.",9,Big Bang Theory,26,5
44876,Howard,10, Look at this. Trent is rebuilding a vintage motorcycle.,9,Big Bang Theory,56,9
44877,Raj,10, That is so cool. Old broken things are so much better than new things that work.,9,Big Bang Theory,81,16
44879,Howard,10," Oh, he's our fan.",9,Big Bang Theory,18,4
44881,Howard,10," Uh, did you forget? We're in a band.",9,Big Bang Theory,37,8
44883,Howard,10, And at the children's hospital until they asked us to leave.,9,Big Bang Theory,61,11
44884,Raj,10," Hey, dude, Trent just checked in at the coffee shop on Fair Oaks.",9,Big Bang Theory,66,13
44885,Howard,10, Really? You want to go down there and meet him?,9,Big Bang Theory,48,10
44887,Raj,10," It's not creepy. I built a Footprints on the Moon fan page, Trent joined it.",9,Big Bang Theory,77,15
44888,Howard,10," After that, all I did was check out his profile, go back in the archive of his feed until I found his Twitter handle.",9,Big Bang Theory,118,24
44889,Raj,10," From there, it was easy to find him on Instagram, Snapchat and pretty much track his every movement.",9,Big Bang Theory,101,18
44890,Howard,10," So if you think that's creepy, you married the wrong guy.",9,Big Bang Theory,58,11
44892,Raj,10," Yeah, like she could get Trent.",9,Big Bang Theory,32,6
44895,Amy,10, Thank you.,9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
44897,Amy,10," When you were married, did your wife cook?",9,Big Bang Theory,43,8
44899,Amy,10," So, a little silver lining.",9,Big Bang Theory,28,5
44901,Amy,10," Uh, about five years. I'm actually thinking of moving to a better place now that I don't need to be so close to, well, you know.",9,Big Bang Theory,129,26
44903,Amy,10," Yeah. Anyway, he doesn't drive, so, I pretty much had to take him everywhere.",9,Big Bang Theory,78,14
44905,Amy,10, My fault. I brought him up.,9,Big Bang Theory,28,6
44908,Sheldon,10," Bah, bam, bum-bum, bah, bum, bum. This song is never going to stop. Have you ever dealt with something so relentlessly irritating?",9,Big Bang Theory,131,22
44909,Leonard,10," That's a trick question, right?",9,Big Bang Theory,32,5
44910,Sheldon,10," Well, I shouldn't be surprised. There's a rich history of brilliant minds descending into madness.",9,Big Bang Theory,99,15
44911,Penny,10," Come on, Sheldon. There are plenty of smart people who don't have mental problems.",9,Big Bang Theory,83,14
44912,Leonard,10," Yup, she's right. For every Newton who had a psychological issue, there's an Edison who was just a jerk. That could totally be you.",9,Big Bang Theory,132,24
44913,Sheldon,10, Empedocles thought he was a god and jumped into a volcano. And Pythagoras had an irrational fear of beans. Tesla fell madly in love with a pigeon who he claimed loved him back.,9,Big Bang Theory,177,33
44914,Penny,10, Maybe he just had bread in his pocket.,9,Big Bang Theory,39,8
44915,Sheldon,10," The list extends outside of science. Painters like Van Gogh and Pollock, chess champion Bobby Fischer, Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys.  I remember the song. It's called Darlin' by the Beach Boys. Oh, thank goodness. I'm not crazy. I don't have to take a pigeon as my bride.",9,Big Bang Theory,274,49
44916,Leonard,10, There goes our shot at him living on the roof.,9,Big Bang Theory,47,10
44918,Raj,10," So, all right, there he is. So, should we introduce ourselves?",9,Big Bang Theory,63,11
44919,Howard,10, No. Let him spot us.,9,Big Bang Theory,21,5
44920,Raj,10, I wonder if he's listening to our music right now.,9,Big Bang Theory,51,10
44921,Howard,10," Could you imagine? What a cool way for us to meet. He's playing our song and looks up, and there we are, his favorite two-piece acoustic sci-fi novelty rock band.",9,Big Bang Theory,163,30
44922,Raj,10," And he's, all, like, aren't you the guys from Footprints on the Moo-oo-ooh what is he doing?!",9,Big Bang Theory,94,17
44923,Howard,10, I can't watch.,9,Big Bang Theory,15,3
44924,Raj,10," It's okay. Oh, it's okay. He's done.",9,Big Bang Theory,37,7
44925,Howard,10, Why is he looking at it?,9,Big Bang Theory,25,6
44926,Raj,10," Eh, no, he's not going to eat it, is he?",9,Big Bang Theory,41,10
44927,Howard,10," Come on, Trent, you're better than th-ah.",9,Big Bang Theory,42,7
44928,Raj,10, Ooh!,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
44929,Howard,10, Let's just go.,9,Big Bang Theory,15,3
44931,Howard,10, Nope.,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
44932,Raj,10," No, never heard of 'em!",9,Big Bang Theory,24,5
44934,Sheldon,10, I wonder why it was this particular song that was stuck in my head.,9,Big Bang Theory,68,14
44935,Leonard,10, I don't know. It's pretty catchy.,9,Big Bang Theory,34,6
44936,Penny,10, Do you even like the Beach Boys?,9,Big Bang Theory,33,7
44937,Sheldon,10, They have beach right in the name. What do you think?,9,Big Bang Theory,54,11
44938,Leonard,10," Well, now that you can focus again, what do you say we get back to surface tension of domain walls?",9,Big Bang Theory,100,20
44939,Sheldon,10, Of course. I'm already seeing a more efficient way of taming the ultravi I know why the song was in my head.,9,Big Bang Theory,109,22
44940,Penny,10, Why?,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
44941,Sheldon,10, It's about Amy.,9,Big Bang Theory,16,3
44942,Penny,10," Okay, look, I know Amy's like an old lady, but she's not old enough to have a song from the sixties written about her.",9,Big Bang Theory,119,24
44943,Sheldon,10," It's about how she made my life better. Consider the lyrics. I was living like half a man. Then I couldn't love, but now I can. More soul than I ever had. I love the way you soften my life.â€ù",9,Big Bang Theory,193,40
44944,Penny,10," She did soften your life, didn't she?",9,Big Bang Theory,38,7
44945,Sheldon,10, Yes. She's like the dryer sheets of my heart. I have to go.,9,Big Bang Theory,60,13
44946,Leonard,10, Aw. Am I like the dryer sheets of your heart?,9,Big Bang Theory,46,10
44947,Penny,10, Better. You're the lint trap of my love.,9,Big Bang Theory,41,8
44948,Leonard,10, Aw.,9,Big Bang Theory,4,1
44950,Amy,10, That's an interesting tie clip.,9,Big Bang Theory,32,5
44952,Amy,10," No, I, I think it's neat. Oh.",9,Big Bang Theory,30,7
44954,Amy,10," No, it, it's okay, and we are on a date. I'm, I'm just a little nervous.",9,Big Bang Theory,73,16
44956,Amy,10," You know, I'm just being silly. I, I don't know what I'm waiting for.",9,Big Bang Theory,70,14
44957,Sheldon,10,  Amy?  Amy?  Amy?,9,Big Bang Theory,18,3
44958,Amy,10, That's Sheldon.,9,Big Bang Theory,16,2
44960,Amy,10," Sheldon, this, this isn't a good time.",9,Big Bang Theory,39,7
44961,Sheldon,10," I don't care. Amy, there was a song I couldn't get out of my head. Eventually, I realized the song was about you, and like that earworm, I can't get you out of my heart. So, what I'm trying to say is, you're my heartworm. The metaphorical kind, not, not the poodle-killing kind.",9,Big Bang Theory,279,53
44962,Amy,10, What?,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
44964,Sheldon,10," I'm, I'm sorry; I didn't realize you were on a date.",9,Big Bang Theory,53,11
44965,Amy,10," No, it, it, it's okay. Keep going?",9,Big Bang Theory,35,7
44966,Sheldon,10," Amy, if you want to be my girlfriend again, I really want to be your boyfriend.",9,Big Bang Theory,80,16
44967,Amy,10," I really want that, too.",9,Big Bang Theory,25,5
44968,Sheldon,10, Good. Because I love you.,9,Big Bang Theory,26,5
44969,Amy,10," I love you, too.",9,Big Bang Theory,17,4
44971,Sheldon,10," Well, I'll let you get back to your date.",9,Big Bang Theory,42,9
44972,Amy,10, Get back here.,9,Big Bang Theory,15,3
44982,Leonard,11," Guys, tickets already went on sale.",9,Big Bang Theory,36,6
44983,Sheldon,11, What?,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
44984,Howard,11, They're not supposed to be available yet.,9,Big Bang Theory,42,7
44985,Leonard,11," I don't know what to tell you, but they're on sale.",9,Big Bang Theory,52,11
44986,Raj,11, Wait. You're sure they're Star Wars tickets?,9,Big Bang Theory,45,7
44987,Sheldon,11, The Web site's frozen. I can't get in.,9,Big Bang Theory,39,8
44988,Leonard,11," Yeah, me, too.",9,Big Bang Theory,15,3
44989,Howard,11, Same here!,9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
44990,Raj,11," Guys, they're gonna sell out.",9,Big Bang Theory,30,5
44991,Howard,11, What are we gonna do?!,9,Big Bang Theory,23,5
44992,Sheldon,11," All right, this goes against everything I stand for, but desperate times call for desperate measures. Lord, this is Sheldon Cooper. You're good friends with my mom. I know I've spent my life denying that you exist.",9,Big Bang Theory,215,37
44993,Howard,11, Got 'em.,9,Big Bang Theory,9,2
44994,Sheldon,11, And I will continue to do so!,9,Big Bang Theory,30,7
44996,Penny,11, I'm really happy you and Amy are back together.,9,Big Bang Theory,48,9
44997,Sheldon,11," Oh, thank you.",9,Big Bang Theory,15,3
44998,Leonard,11," I'm also really happy, but I can't pretend it's for you. New Star Wars in three days.",9,Big Bang Theory,86,17
44999,Sheldon,11," Hey, Thursday can't get here soon enough. I'm taking off work to watch the original trilogy while I eat enough Star Wars cereal to choke a Wookiee.",9,Big Bang Theory,148,27
45000,Penny,11," Uh, sweetie, you do realize Thursday is Amy's birthday.",9,Big Bang Theory,56,9
45001,Sheldon,11," And you do realize I bought my ticket when Amy and I were broken up? I hope you didn't need anything in that case, 'cause it's closed.",9,Big Bang Theory,135,27
45002,Penny,11, You guys just got back together. You might not want to ditch her on her birthday.,9,Big Bang Theory,82,16
45003,Leonard,11, I think Penny has a point. You can see it another day.,9,Big Bang Theory,55,12
45004,Sheldon,11," But someone might spoil the movie. No one can spoil Amy's birthday for me. Surprise, she's even older. Who saw that coming?",9,Big Bang Theory,124,22
45005,Penny,11," Aw, that's nice. Put that on her cake.",9,Big Bang Theory,39,8
45008,Sheldon,11," Arthur, what brings you back?",9,Big Bang Theory,30,5
45010,Sheldon,11," In the past, you've come to me when I'm struggling with a dilemma.",9,Big Bang Theory,67,13
45012,Sheldon,11," Well, my friends are telling me I shouldn't abandon my girlfriend on her birthday to see the new Star Wars movie.",9,Big Bang Theory,114,21
45014,Sheldon,11," Those are the robes of the Jedi, the guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy.",9,Big Bang Theory,83,16
45016,Sheldon,11," So, you agree with my friends that I should skip the premiere?",9,Big Bang Theory,63,12
45018,Sheldon,11, Yes. But she knows how important Star Wars is to me.,9,Big Bang Theory,53,11
45020,Sheldon,11, By seeing the movie she'd want me to see?,9,Big Bang Theory,42,9
45022,Sheldon,11, You're right.,9,Big Bang Theory,14,2
45024,Sheldon,11, Where are you going?,9,Big Bang Theory,21,4
45027,Amy,11," Sheldon, what's wrong?",9,Big Bang Theory,23,3
45028,Sheldon,11, I wanted to let you know I'll be spending your birthday with you.,9,Big Bang Theory,66,13
45029,Amy,11, Okay.,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
45030,Sheldon,11," See, I, I had tickets to the Star Wars premiere that night, but Professor Proton came to me in a dream dressed as Obi-Wan Kenobi and convinced me I should be with you.",9,Big Bang Theory,168,33
45031,Amy,11, Obi-what?,9,Big Bang Theory,10,1
45032,Sheldon,11," I'll, I'll let you get back to sleep now. Good night.",9,Big Bang Theory,54,11
45033,Amy,11," Okay. Good night. Wait. Um, Sheldon, were you actually not gonna spend my birthday with me?",9,Big Bang Theory,92,16
45034,Sheldon,11, It's late. Got to go. Bye.,9,Big Bang Theory,27,6
45036,Raj,11, Good for Sheldon deciding to stay with Amy on her birthday.,9,Big Bang Theory,60,11
45037,Leonard,11, I know. It's still gonna be weird to see the movie without him.,9,Big Bang Theory,64,13
45038,Howard,11," Well, we could wait a couple days and see it together.  ",9,Big Bang Theory,57,11
45039,Sheldon,11, Hello.,9,Big Bang Theory,7,1
45040,Leonard,11, Hey. We're going to the comic book store. You want to come?,9,Big Bang Theory,60,12
45041,Sheldon,11," No, I can't. I need to make preparations for Amy's birthday. Which leads me to the following bit of business. This is my ticket to Star Wars. I don't have to tell you it is worth far more than its face value of fifteen dollars and fifty cents. I trust you'll give it to someone worthy.",9,Big Bang Theory,286,56
45042,Leonard,11," You got it. Well, Penny might want to join us.",9,Big Bang Theory,47,10
45043,Sheldon,11, This is my ticket to Star Wars.,9,Big Bang Theory,32,7
45045,Sheldon,11,  Penny.  Penny.  Penny.,9,Big Bang Theory,24,3
45047,Penny,11," Well, find out.",9,Big Bang Theory,16,3
45049,Sheldon,11,  Bernadette.  Bernadette.  Bernadette.,9,Big Bang Theory,39,3
45050,Penny,11, Come in.,9,Big Bang Theory,9,2
45051,Sheldon,11, Keep it up. I got nowhere else to be.,9,Big Bang Theory,38,9
45053,Sheldon,11," For future reference, if I want to watch Mean Girls, I'll stream it on Netflix.",9,Big Bang Theory,80,15
45054,Penny,11, We're sorry. What do you need?,9,Big Bang Theory,31,6
45055,Sheldon,11," Well, as you know, I'll be celebrating Amy's birthday with her, and I could use your assistance in helping me select the perfect gift.",9,Big Bang Theory,135,24
45057,Sheldon,11," Well, so far, I've come up with three ideas. The first is a chance for her to play the harp with the L.A. Philharmonic.",9,Big Bang Theory,120,24
45058,Penny,11, Wow. You can really arrange that?,9,Big Bang Theory,34,6
45059,Sheldon,11," Well, I said a chance, you know. When you tell them it's your birthday at Bennigan's, they make a fuss. I don't see why the Philharmonic would be any different.",9,Big Bang Theory,161,30
45061,Sheldon,11," Well, Amy enjoys knitting her own sweaters, so I was thinking of getting her an all-expense-paid trip to the Wisconsin Sheep and Wool Festival.",9,Big Bang Theory,144,24
45062,Penny,11, Sorry. I was waiting for the bazinga.,9,Big Bang Theory,38,7
45064,Sheldon,11," No, no, no, no. She'd be going alone. Well, if you think I'm afraid of birds, you should see me around sheep.",9,Big Bang Theory,110,22
45065,Penny,11," Okay, well, what's the third option?",9,Big Bang Theory,37,6
45066,Sheldon,11, That I have coitus with her.,9,Big Bang Theory,29,6
45068,Leonard,11, What do you think about giving Sheldon's ticket to Stuart?,9,Big Bang Theory,59,10
45069,Raj,11, I don't know. Have you ever seen a movie with Stuart before?,9,Big Bang Theory,61,12
45070,Howard,11," It's like going with your grandpa. Instead of eating popcorn, he brings little pieces of chicken in Tupperware and a thermos full of soup.",9,Big Bang Theory,139,24
45071,Leonard,11," He's not that bad. Hey, Stuart, got any plans Thursday night?",9,Big Bang Theory,62,11
45073,Leonard,11, Well,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
45075,Howard,11," Oh, make sure to wear sensible shoes. Wil, want to go to Star Wars Thursday?",9,Big Bang Theory,77,15
45079,Penny,11," Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Let's, let's, let's just recap our options. All right, we've got harp thing, sheep thing.",9,Big Bang Theory,120,20
45081,Sheldon,11," Which do you think she'd prefer? Because I checked the Sheep and Wool Festival Web site, and there's only 8,000 tickets left.",9,Big Bang Theory,126,22
45082,Penny,11," Sheldon, being physical with Amy is a huge step for you.",9,Big Bang Theory,57,11
45084,Sheldon,11," Intimacy in any form has been challenging for me, but I'd like to show her how important she is, and it feels like now might be the right time.",9,Big Bang Theory,144,29
45085,Penny,11," Sheldon, that's so beautiful.",9,Big Bang Theory,30,4
45086,Sheldon,11, Then it's settled. Amy's birthday present will be my genitals.,9,Big Bang Theory,63,10
45088,Amy,11, Thanks for taking me out.,9,Big Bang Theory,26,5
45089,Penny,11," Well, you're spending your birthday with Sheldon. Why not celebrate early?",9,Big Bang Theory,75,11
45091,Amy,11, I heard that new Mexican place on Green Street is good.,9,Big Bang Theory,56,11
45092,Penny,11," Sure, sure. Or we could take you to get a bikini wax.",9,Big Bang Theory,54,12
45093,Amy,11, Why would I get a bikini wax for my birthday?,9,Big Bang Theory,46,10
45094,Penny,11," Uh, I don't know. It was just a thought.",9,Big Bang Theory,41,9
45095,Amy,11, I think I'll just stick to Mexican.,9,Big Bang Theory,36,7
45097,Amy,11," Okay, what is going on?",9,Big Bang Theory,24,5
45098,Penny,11," Oh, we just want you to be prepared for any surprises that might happen tomorrow.",9,Big Bang Theory,82,15
45099,Amy,11, What surprises?,9,Big Bang Theory,16,2
45101,Amy,11, You shut your damn mouth. You actually heard him say this?,9,Big Bang Theory,59,11
45102,Penny,11, Yes. He said he wants to do something to show you how much you mean to him.,9,Big Bang Theory,76,17
45103,Amy,11," I, I can't believe it. I, I don't know what to say.",9,Big Bang Theory,52,12
45105,Amy,11, I do know what to say. Let's get me waxed.,9,Big Bang Theory,43,10
45108,Sheldon,11, You're back.,9,Big Bang Theory,13,2
45110,Sheldon,11," I suppose you're here because I've decided to be physical with my girlfriend, and I've never done that before.",9,Big Bang Theory,111,19
45112,Sheldon,11," So, can you help me?",9,Big Bang Theory,21,5
45114,Sheldon,11," Oh, no. Not that. I, I understand the mechanics.",9,Big Bang Theory,49,9
45116,Sheldon,11, I think they say junk.,9,Big Bang Theory,23,5
45118,Sheldon,11," This is an important night for us, and I'm worried I might be overwhelmed and ruin everything.",9,Big Bang Theory,95,17
45120,Sheldon,11," Thank you, Arthur. You are the wisest of the wise.",9,Big Bang Theory,51,10
45122,Sheldon,11," Oh, sure. Well, you're fun to look at.",9,Big Bang Theory,39,8
45124,Raj,11, Tonight's the night.,9,Big Bang Theory,21,3
45125,Leonard,11," Yeah, the wait is finally over.",9,Big Bang Theory,32,6
45126,Penny,11, I know. Then you'll finally stop talking about it.,9,Big Bang Theory,51,9
45127,Howard,11, Ready to go?,9,Big Bang Theory,13,3
45128,Raj,11, Let's do this.,9,Big Bang Theory,15,3
45129,Penny,11," Have fun, guys.",9,Big Bang Theory,16,3
45130,Leonard,11, We will.,9,Big Bang Theory,9,2
45131,Raj,11, I can't believe Sheldon gave this up.,9,Big Bang Theory,38,7
45132,Howard,11, I know.,9,Big Bang Theory,8,2
45133,Leonard,11, We're gonna have so much more fun than him.,9,Big Bang Theory,44,9
45135,Penny,11," Knowing them, they will.",9,Big Bang Theory,25,4
45137,Howard,11, T minus 15 minutes.,9,Big Bang Theory,20,4
45138,Raj,11," Oh, did you hear from Wil?",9,Big Bang Theory,27,6
45139,Leonard,11," Yeah, he's on his way. Time for bladder check.",9,Big Bang Theory,47,9
45140,Raj,11, Check.,9,Big Bang Theory,7,1
45141,Leonard,11, Check.,9,Big Bang Theory,7,1
45142,Howard,11, Check. Wait. Screw it. I'm holding it.,9,Big Bang Theory,39,7
45143,Raj,11, What is everyone booing at?,9,Big Bang Theory,28,5
45145,Leonard,11," Um, hey, Wil. What you doin'?",9,Big Bang Theory,30,6
45150,Sheldon,11,  Birthday girl.  Birthday girl.  Birthday girl.,9,Big Bang Theory,48,6
45151,Amy,11, Come in.,9,Big Bang Theory,9,2
45152,Sheldon,11, Oh.,9,Big Bang Theory,4,1
45153,Amy,11," Hi, Sheldon.",9,Big Bang Theory,13,2
45154,Sheldon,11," Hello. Sorry I'm late. I also got you a balloon, but it floated away, and I chased it for a while.",9,Big Bang Theory,99,21
45155,Amy,11," That's okay. Come on in. Thank you. Um, I'll, I'm gonna go put these in water.",9,Big Bang Theory,79,16
45156,Sheldon,11," Okay. Ooh, this is different, hmm? Candles and music.",9,Big Bang Theory,54,9
45157,Amy,11, Do you like it?,9,Big Bang Theory,16,4
45158,Sheldon,11, It's kind of spooky.,9,Big Bang Theory,21,4
45159,Amy,11, I can change it back.,9,Big Bang Theory,22,5
45160,Sheldon,11," No, no, no. It's your birthday. As long as no one jumps out in a hockey mask, I'll be fine.",9,Big Bang Theory,92,20
45161,Amy,11," So, what'd you have in mind for tonight?",9,Big Bang Theory,41,8
45162,Sheldon,11," I thought I could take you out to a nice birthday dinner. If we pick a place east of here, we might find the balloon.",9,Big Bang Theory,118,25
45163,Amy,11," Um, that sounds nice, but I'm not really hungry right now. I thought maybe we could do presents first.",9,Big Bang Theory,103,19
45164,Sheldon,11, Oh. All right. Um. I should probably tell you something about this gift.,9,Big Bang Theory,73,13
45165,Amy,11, You mean before you give it to me?,9,Big Bang Theory,35,8
45166,Sheldon,11, Yes. May I ask you a question before I give it to you?,9,Big Bang Theory,55,13
45167,Amy,11, Of course.,9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
45168,Sheldon,11, Why are we saying give it to you like that?,9,Big Bang Theory,44,10
45169,Amy,11," Sheldon, I know your present is for us to be intimate tonight.",9,Big Bang Theory,63,12
45170,Sheldon,11," I see. Is that all right? I'm sorry, but this is a litigious society. I'm gonna need verbal consent.",9,Big Bang Theory,101,19
45171,Amy,11, Yes.,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
45172,Sheldon,11," You know what, let me pull a quick contract off the Internet.",9,Big Bang Theory,62,12
45174,Leonard,11," So, if you don't like Star Wars, why are you here?",9,Big Bang Theory,51,11
45176,Raj,11," Is it bad? Did you hear something? Oh, my God. It's bad. Somebody kill me.",9,Big Bang Theory,75,15
45178,Howard,11, He's right.,9,Big Bang Theory,12,2
45179,Leonard,11," Yeah. No matter what happens, we're coming back tomorrow to watch it again.",9,Big Bang Theory,76,13
45182,Penny,11, I don't know. He said he's ready.,9,Big Bang Theory,34,7
45184,Penny,11," Well, I'm gonna stay positive. I mean, we talked, I told him what women like, and after he stopped giggling, he seemed pretty sure of himself.",9,Big Bang Theory,143,26
45186,Amy,11, Hi.,9,Big Bang Theory,4,1
45187,Sheldon,11, Hello.,9,Big Bang Theory,7,1
45188,Amy,11," So, um, should I get under the covers with you?",9,Big Bang Theory,48,10
45189,Sheldon,11, All right. Hello.,9,Big Bang Theory,18,3
45190,Amy,11, Hi.,9,Big Bang Theory,4,1
45191,Sheldon,11, Why are you shaking? Are you cold?,9,Big Bang Theory,35,7
45192,Amy,11," I'm just, um, really nervous.",9,Big Bang Theory,30,5
45193,Sheldon,11, Why?,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
45194,Amy,11," Well, I've been waiting for this for so long, I've just built it up in my head. I don't know what to expect.",9,Big Bang Theory,109,23
45195,Sheldon,11, Neither do I. But we can find out together.,9,Big Bang Theory,44,9
45196,Amy,11, Okay.,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
45198,Leonard,11, I'm really nervous.,9,Big Bang Theory,20,3
45199,Howard,11, I know. We've been waiting so long for this.,9,Big Bang Theory,45,9
45200,Raj,11, And we've built it up in our heads so much.,9,Big Bang Theory,44,10
45202,Leonard,11, That's true.,9,Big Bang Theory,13,2
45203,Howard,11, He's right.,9,Big Bang Theory,12,2
45204,Raj,11, It is.,9,Big Bang Theory,7,2
45206,Raj,11," Leonard, I, I'm scared again.",9,Big Bang Theory,30,5
45208,Sheldon,11," Well, I enjoyed that more than I thought I would.",9,Big Bang Theory,50,10
45209,Amy,11," Me, too.",9,Big Bang Theory,9,2
45210,Sheldon,11, I look forward to your next birthday when we do it again.,9,Big Bang Theory,58,12
45211,Amy,11, That works for me.,9,Big Bang Theory,19,4
45214,Raj,11, I don't think I can walk right now.,9,Big Bang Theory,36,8
45217,Sheldon,11," Arthur. What are you doing here? I, I don't think I need any more advice.",9,Big Bang Theory,74,15
45219,Sheldon,11," Oh. It was amazing. I, I saw it a few days later. What a movie.",9,Big Bang Theory,64,15
45221,Sheldon,11," Oh. Uh, uh, she liked it fine. But she doesn't have the history with the franchise I do.",9,Big Bang Theory,89,18
45224,Sheldon,12, I'm glad to see you made it safely. How's your hotel?,9,Big Bang Theory,54,11
45225,Amy,12," It's not the best Best Western I've been to, but I'd say it's the third best Best Western I've been to.",9,Big Bang Theory,104,21
45226,Sheldon,12," I know how you feel. The Best Buy by my house is only the third best Best Buy. They have the best buys, but having the best buys isn't the only thing that makes a Best Buy the best Best Buy.",9,Big Bang Theory,191,41
45227,Amy,12, What makes a best Best Buy the best Best Buy?,9,Big Bang Theory,46,10
45228,Sheldon,12," Mm, that's a great question. I like when they're next to a Chipotle.",9,Big Bang Theory,69,13
45229,Amy,12," Okay, well, I should unpack.",9,Big Bang Theory,29,5
45230,Sheldon,12, All right. Enjoy the neurobiology conference.,9,Big Bang Theory,46,6
45231,Amy,12, I will. I wish you were here.,9,Big Bang Theory,30,7
45232,Sheldon,12, At a neurobiology conference? What a mean thing to say.,9,Big Bang Theory,56,10
45233,Amy,12," Okay, I'm glad you're not here?",9,Big Bang Theory,32,6
45234,Sheldon,12," Aw, you always know just what to say after I tell you what to say.",9,Big Bang Theory,67,15
45235,Amy,12," Good-bye, Sheldon.",9,Big Bang Theory,19,2
45236,Sheldon,12," Bye. Oh, good news, gentlemen. Amy's at a conference this weekend, which means I'm available to be entertained, hmm. As today's youth might put it, who wants to get their Sheld-on?",9,Big Bang Theory,181,31
45237,Howard,12, Bernie and I are getting the house ready for the remodel. We could always use an extra pair of hands.,9,Big Bang Theory,102,20
45238,Sheldon,12, That sounds awful. Raj?,9,Big Bang Theory,24,4
45239,Raj,12," Uh, I've got time booked in the telescope room all weekend scanning for rogue planets. You're more than welcome to join me.",9,Big Bang Theory,124,22
45240,Sheldon,12, That's the one to beat. Leonard?,9,Big Bang Theory,33,6
45241,Leonard,12," Oh, if anything, I'm trying to get my Sheld-off.",9,Big Bang Theory,49,9
45242,Sheldon,12," Well, then it looks like we have a winner. Congratulations.",9,Big Bang Theory,60,10
45243,Raj,12," Well, I should warn you, it's just looking at data for hours and hours on a computer screen.",9,Big Bang Theory,93,18
45244,Sheldon,12," Uh, stop selling it, kid. You won.",9,Big Bang Theory,35,7
45246,Penny,12, Hey.,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
45247,Leonard,12, Hey.,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
45248,Raj,12, Hello.,9,Big Bang Theory,7,1
45249,Howard,12, Hi.,9,Big Bang Theory,4,1
45250,Leonard,12, How was your day?,9,Big Bang Theory,18,4
45251,Penny,12," Oh, not good. Still couldn't get in to see Dr. Gallo.",9,Big Bang Theory,54,11
45252,Sheldon,12," A doctor? Well, I hope you're not contagious. I've got a weekend in the telescope room I've been excited about for almost three minutes.",9,Big Bang Theory,137,24
45253,Penny,12, I'm not sick. It's for work. There's this doctor who refuses to see any sales reps. I've been trying to get in for months.,9,Big Bang Theory,123,24
45254,Leonard,12," Well, did you try wearing the shirt I said was inappropriate for work?",9,Big Bang Theory,71,13
45255,Penny,12," Well, the doctor's a woman, but yes, because you never know.",9,Big Bang Theory,61,11
45256,Howard,12, What kind of doctor is she?,9,Big Bang Theory,28,6
45257,Penny,12," Um, a psychiatrist. Why?",9,Big Bang Theory,25,4
45258,Howard,12," Well, what if you make an appointment as a patient? Then you'll get to talk to her.",9,Big Bang Theory,84,17
45259,Penny,12," Yeah, they already know I'm a pharmaceutical sales rep.",9,Big Bang Theory,56,9
45260,Raj,12, Oh. What if Leonard made an appointment and tried to lay some groundwork for you?,9,Big Bang Theory,82,15
45261,Penny,12, That's interesting.,9,Big Bang Theory,20,2
45262,Leonard,12, I'm not gonna make a fake appointment with a psychiatrist. What would I say is wrong with me?,9,Big Bang Theory,94,18
45263,Raj,12, Low self-esteem.,9,Big Bang Theory,17,2
45264,Howard,12, Social anxiety.,9,Big Bang Theory,16,2
45265,Sheldon,12, Sexual insecurity.,9,Big Bang Theory,19,2
45266,Leonard,12, None of that is true.,9,Big Bang Theory,22,5
45267,Penny,12," Uh, denial. See, sweetie, the list goes on and on.",9,Big Bang Theory,51,10
45268,Leonard,12, That's just crazy. How would my going in there even help you?,9,Big Bang Theory,62,12
45269,Penny,12," I don't know. You could talk to her, and maybe if it comes up, you could ask if she's heard about the drug.",9,Big Bang Theory,108,23
45270,Leonard,12, What if I get caught?,9,Big Bang Theory,22,5
45271,Howard,12, Fear of failure.,9,Big Bang Theory,17,3
45272,Raj,12, Lack of confidence.,9,Big Bang Theory,20,3
45273,Sheldon,12, Kind of a wuss.,9,Big Bang Theory,16,4
45274,Leonard,12," Fine, I'll do it. But not because of them, because I love you.",9,Big Bang Theory,63,13
45275,Penny,12, Thank you.,9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
45276,Raj,12, Pushover.,9,Big Bang Theory,10,1
45277,Howard,12, Spineless.,9,Big Bang Theory,11,1
45278,Sheldon,12, Still hasn't bought milk even though I told him two days ago.,9,Big Bang Theory,62,12
45280,Howard,12, That was incredible.,9,Big Bang Theory,21,3
45282,Howard,12, I know. It's not like he returns the favour when he watches his Japanese porn cartoons.,9,Big Bang Theory,88,16
45284,Howard,12," What is it, Stuart?",9,Big Bang Theory,20,4
45286,Howard,12, Hang on. Should I send him away?,9,Big Bang Theory,33,7
45289,Howard,12, What's up?,9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
45291,Howard,12, Wow. I thought I was done getting lucky tonight.,9,Big Bang Theory,49,9
45297,Howard,12, What?,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
45300,Sheldon,12, What are you doing?,9,Big Bang Theory,20,4
45301,Raj,12," Uh, making sure the telescope's camera is white-field balanced.",9,Big Bang Theory,64,9
45302,Sheldon,12, Hmm. What are you doing now?,9,Big Bang Theory,29,6
45303,Raj,12, Still making sure the telescope's camera is white-field balanced.,9,Big Bang Theory,66,9
45304,Sheldon,12," Oh, I see. How about now?",9,Big Bang Theory,26,6
45305,Raj,12, Now I'm making sure the telescope's camera is white-field balanced and wishing you had a colouring book.,9,Big Bang Theory,105,17
45306,Sheldon,12," Well, I can be helpful. Give me something to do. You know, my father took me to work once, and in ten minutes I figured out who'd been stealing from the cash register. It was my father. Yeah, Dad lost his job, but Mr. Hinckley gave me a Fudgsicle.",9,Big Bang Theory,248,49
45307,Raj,12," Fine, you want something to do? There's about six months of data on this hard drive. Why don't you go through it and see if you can spot any patterns or anomalies.",9,Big Bang Theory,164,32
45308,Sheldon,12," Yep, I'm on it. Hey, look at that, an Indian guy outsourcing a computer job to a white fella.",9,Big Bang Theory,94,19
45309,Raj,12," Yeah, okay, whatever it takes to keep you busy for a few hours.",9,Big Bang Theory,64,13
45310,Sheldon,12, Found one.,9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
45311,Raj,12," No, you didn't. There are millions of data points there.",9,Big Bang Theory,57,10
45312,Sheldon,12," But, look, an optical transient.",9,Big Bang Theory,33,5
45313,Raj,12," Yeah, maybe that is something. How did you find that?",9,Big Bang Theory,54,10
45314,Sheldon,12," It wasn't difficult. You know how when you see prime numbers, they appear red, but when they're twin primes, they're pink and smell like gasoline?",9,Big Bang Theory,147,25
45315,Raj,12, No.,9,Big Bang Theory,4,1
45316,Sheldon,12," Oh. I guess I'm a special boy. You know, sometimes when a boy is special, he gets a Fudgsicle. Which, by the way, tastes like the speed of light.",9,Big Bang Theory,146,29
45318,Leonard,12, Thank you for seeing me on such short notice.,9,Big Bang Theory,46,9
45320,Leonard,12," Uh, she's my mother. You know her?",9,Big Bang Theory,35,7
45322,Leonard,12," Well, then you know her better than I do.",9,Big Bang Theory,42,9
45324,Leonard,12," Really? Any chance you find them cold, cruel and unsuitable for innocent little boys who just want to be happy?",9,Big Bang Theory,112,20
45326,Leonard,12," No, no, say it. Sing it. Rent a plane, write it in the sky.",9,Big Bang Theory,60,14
45328,Leonard,12," Oh, no, I, I've worked through a lot of that stuff, I'm better now.",9,Big Bang Theory,68,14
45330,Leonard,12," Do you know she never let me celebrate my birthday because being born was her achievement, not mine?",9,Big Bang Theory,101,18
45332,Leonard,12," Right? To this day, I send her a card every year with a little money in it.",9,Big Bang Theory,76,17
45334,Howard,12," You know, once we get the house back to ourselves, we can be romantic in any room we want.",9,Big Bang Theory,91,19
45337,Howard,12, No one.,9,Big Bang Theory,8,2
45342,Howard,12, Yeah. A grown man moving into his own apartment. Crazy times. See ya.,9,Big Bang Theory,70,13
45350,Howard,12, He's gone. Let's start in the garage.,9,Big Bang Theory,38,7
45352,Raj,12," Okay, so once we receive the next image and compare it to the ones we've already collected, we'll know what it is that we found.",9,Big Bang Theory,129,25
45353,Sheldon,12," Ooh, perhaps it's a Heliosheath scintillation.",9,Big Bang Theory,47,6
45354,Raj,12, It could be a trans-Neptunian object.,9,Big Bang Theory,38,6
45355,Sheldon,12, Maybe it's a new planet.,9,Big Bang Theory,25,5
45356,Raj,12," Unlikely, but it could be a dwarf planet.",9,Big Bang Theory,42,8
45357,Sheldon,12," Well, as long as it has a healthy gravity and all its moons, I'll be happy.",9,Big Bang Theory,76,16
45358,Raj,12," Okay, the final image is coming in. And the object we discovered is",9,Big Bang Theory,68,13
45359,Sheldon,12," Come on, Daddy needs a livable planet he can rule with an iron fist.",9,Big Bang Theory,69,14
45360,Raj,12, A medium-sized asteroid.,9,Big Bang Theory,25,3
45361,Sheldon,12, That's it? How common. That's the chicken fingers on the menu of space.,9,Big Bang Theory,72,13
45362,Raj,12, I kind of like chicken fingers.,9,Big Bang Theory,32,6
45363,Sheldon,12," Yeah, me, too. I was stuck for a metaphor.",9,Big Bang Theory,43,9
45364,Raj,12," Come on, a medium-sized asteroid is still an interesting discovery.",9,Big Bang Theory,68,10
45365,Sheldon,12, I suppose it could end up on a collision course with Earth and destroy life as we know it.,9,Big Bang Theory,91,19
45366,Raj,12, You dream different than me.,9,Big Bang Theory,29,5
45367,Sheldon,12, It is kind of cute.,9,Big Bang Theory,20,5
45368,Raj,12," Yeah, it is. And you know we get to name it.",9,Big Bang Theory,45,11
45369,Sheldon,12, We better choose a name no one can make fun of. Sir Frederick William Herschel didn't do Uranus any favours.,9,Big Bang Theory,109,20
45371,Leonard,12, Hi.,9,Big Bang Theory,4,1
45372,Penny,12," Hey, how'd it go?",9,Big Bang Theory,18,4
45373,Leonard,12," Oh, great. Dr. Gallo is terrific. You know, I, I've always been insecure that no one cares about what I have to say, but she made me see",9,Big Bang Theory,137,28
45374,Penny,12," Yeah, no one cares. Did you help me out or not?",9,Big Bang Theory,48,11
45375,Leonard,12," Okay, now, what I'm hearing is that you feel that I sometimes take too long to express myself, and you wish I'd be more succinct.",9,Big Bang Theory,130,25
45376,Penny,12, You're only hearing that because I cannot roll my eyes any louder.,9,Big Bang Theory,67,12
45377,Leonard,12," All right, well, after we talked about my issues with my mother, nothing too deep, just how she ruined my life, I told her about you and your drug. She said she'd be happy to meet you.",9,Big Bang Theory,185,37
45378,Penny,12," Really? Oh, you're the best husband ever.",9,Big Bang Theory,42,7
45379,Leonard,12, So you'll go to the Doctor Who convention with me next week?,9,Big Bang Theory,61,12
45380,Penny,12, I guess.,9,Big Bang Theory,9,2
45381,Leonard,12," Oh, I actually did hear your eyes roll that time.",9,Big Bang Theory,50,10
45384,Howard,12," No kidding. Oh, okay, I'm about to suck something up. What do you think this object sounds like?",9,Big Bang Theory,97,18
45386,Howard,12," Well, I was thinking a home theatre or a gaming room, you know, like a man cave.",9,Big Bang Theory,81,17
45388,Howard,12," As long as it has a home theatre, a video game system and you're not allowed in it, you can call it whatever you want.",9,Big Bang Theory,119,25
45390,Howard,12," Well, what do you think we should do?",9,Big Bang Theory,38,8
45392,Howard,12, Oh. He was so excited.,9,Big Bang Theory,23,5
45394,Howard,12, I'll give it to him next time I see him.,9,Big Bang Theory,41,10
45396,Howard,12, No. You'd think he would've called once he got settled in.,9,Big Bang Theory,59,11
45398,Howard,12, Too busy to call? He wasn't too busy to binge-watch Hot in Cleveland with my Hulu password. What is happening? Are we missing him?,9,Big Bang Theory,131,24
45400,Howard,12, Of course not. He drove us crazy. Like when you were gonna make that pie and Stuart ate all the blueberries.,9,Big Bang Theory,109,21
45402,Howard,12, That was pretty cute.,9,Big Bang Theory,22,4
45405,Raj,12," So I was thinking, maybe we can come up with a name for the asteroid by combining our names.",9,Big Bang Theory,93,19
45406,Sheldon,12, That's a great idea. I've got it. We'll call it Cooper.,9,Big Bang Theory,56,11
45407,Raj,12, How is that both our names?,9,Big Bang Theory,28,6
45408,Sheldon,12, Koo from Koothrappali and per from Cooper.,9,Big Bang Theory,43,7
45409,Raj,12," Yeah, s-so it's, like, Kooper with a K?",9,Big Bang Theory,40,8
45410,Sheldon,12," Nah, you're right, that's dumb.",9,Big Bang Theory,32,5
45411,Leonard,12, Hey.,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
45412,Sheldon,12," Oh, Leonard, great news. We discovered a medium-sized asteroid together.",9,Big Bang Theory,73,10
45413,Leonard,12," Wow, that's amazing. I'm in a pretty great mood today myself.",9,Big Bang Theory,62,11
45414,Sheldon,12, Okay. Guess we're gonna talk about you now.,9,Big Bang Theory,44,8
45415,Leonard,12," Well, we are, because Dr. Gallo made me realize that I'm a worthwhile person and that my feelings matter.",9,Big Bang Theory,106,19
45416,Raj,12," I learned that for free from a cat poster, but good for you.",9,Big Bang Theory,61,13
45417,Sheldon,12," Okay, back to me. I discovered an asteroid, and now I get to name it.",9,Big Bang Theory,70,15
45418,Raj,12," Wait, what happened to us?",9,Big Bang Theory,27,5
45419,Sheldon,12," Now, this isn't about us, this is about what's best for the asteroid.",9,Big Bang Theory,70,13
45420,Leonard,12," Well, what are you thinking of naming it?",9,Big Bang Theory,42,8
45421,Sheldon,12, I haven't settled on anything yet.,9,Big Bang Theory,35,6
45422,Raj,12, We haven't settled on anything yet.,9,Big Bang Theory,36,6
45423,Sheldon,12," All right, way to go, Cat Poster. You hang in there.",9,Big Bang Theory,53,11
45424,Leonard,12, You know what'd be nice? Name it after your girlfriends. Show them how much you care.,9,Big Bang Theory,86,16
45425,Raj,12, That is a great idea.,9,Big Bang Theory,22,5
45426,Sheldon,12," It's perfect. It appears romantic, but it's really just a rock in space that gets me out of Valentine's Day forever.",9,Big Bang Theory,117,21
45427,Raj,12," So, uh, what were you thinking? Combine their names?",9,Big Bang Theory,53,9
45428,Sheldon,12," I like it. Yeah, we'll take the A-M from Amy and, uh, the Y from Emily.",9,Big Bang Theory,72,16
45429,Raj,12, That's just Amy.,9,Big Bang Theory,17,3
45430,Sheldon,12, Exactly. See how well we work together?,9,Big Bang Theory,40,7
45431,Penny,12," And in double-blind studies, Placinex proved extremely effective in treating all kinds of anxiety. Actually, funny story, the boys in the lab were worried about getting FDA approval for Placinex. They started taking it, stopped worrying.",9,Big Bang Theory,238,36
45433,Penny,12," Uh, do you have any questions?",9,Big Bang Theory,31,6
45435,Penny,12, Mm-hmm?,9,Big Bang Theory,8,1
45437,Penny,12, I just meant a question about the drug.,9,Big Bang Theory,40,8
45439,Penny,12, I don't wanna.,9,Big Bang Theory,15,3
45441,Penny,12," You know, I used to wear tank tops a lot. That was a big selling point.",9,Big Bang Theory,72,16
45443,Amy,12," Hi, Sheldon. What's up?",9,Big Bang Theory,24,4
45444,Sheldon,12, Good news. You're an asteroid.,9,Big Bang Theory,31,5
45445,Amy,12," Uh, please tell me what to say next.",9,Big Bang Theory,37,8
45446,Sheldon,12," Perhaps I should explain. While working with Koothrappali, we discovered an asteroid, and I named it after you.",9,Big Bang Theory,112,18
45447,Amy,12," Oh. Sheldon, thank you. That's so romantic. But what about Rajesh? He was okay with you choosing the name?",9,Big Bang Theory,107,19
45448,Sheldon,12," Well, it took a little negotiating, but I wore him down. Uh, we get the asteroid, and if you and I have children, they all have to be named Rajesh.",9,Big Bang Theory,148,30
45449,Amy,12, All of them?,9,Big Bang Theory,13,3
45450,Sheldon,12, Even the girls.,9,Big Bang Theory,16,3
45451,Amy,12," Okay, I think I know what to say now.",9,Big Bang Theory,38,9
45453,Penny,12," How can I not sound like his mother when our entire bedroom is filled with Star Wars toys? I mean, have you ever had sex with a stuffed Wookiee watching you?",9,Big Bang Theory,158,31
45455,Penny,12," You know, if anything, he's turning me into his mother. Before I did pharmaceutical sales, I was an actress. You know, I was pretty good. You know, girl-next-door type, but hot. Doable.",9,Big Bang Theory,186,32
45457,Penny,12," And not only am I Leonard's mother, but we have this man-child living with us named Sheldon.",9,Big Bang Theory,93,17
45459,Penny,12," Yeah, he's as real as the fine I get when I use too much toilet paper.",9,Big Bang Theory,71,16
45461,Penny,12," I do. You know, Leonard's right. Talking to you is really helping.",9,Big Bang Theory,67,12
45463,Penny,12," Okay, if you think it'll help. Oh, just don't make it Placinex. I do not need sudden fits of homicidal rage.",9,Big Bang Theory,109,21
45465,Amy,12, I miss you.,9,Big Bang Theory,12,3
45466,Sheldon,12, I miss you as well.,9,Big Bang Theory,20,5
45468,Howard,12, I can't believe I miss Stuart.,9,Big Bang Theory,31,6
45470,Penny,12, I guess I just miss when life was simpler.,9,Big Bang Theory,43,9
45473,Leonard,12," Remember, girls, you decide what makes you happy, not your emotionally withholding mothers.",9,Big Bang Theory,92,13
45478,Penny,13," Hey, so I saw a movie trailer the other day. How could Batman possibly fight Superman? I mean, isn't that dumb?",9,Big Bang Theory,112,21
45481,Penny,13," No, no, no, no, no. I've seen that movie. It's called Iron Man.",9,Big Bang Theory,64,13
45482,Leonard,13, What is happening?,9,Big Bang Theory,19,3
45483,Howard,13, I don't know.,9,Big Bang Theory,14,3
45484,Raj,13, But it's beautiful.,9,Big Bang Theory,20,3
45485,Penny,13, And now Ben Affleck is Batman?,9,Big Bang Theory,31,6
45487,Penny,13," Ooh, we should watch that next girls' night.",9,Big Bang Theory,45,8
45489,Penny,13," Oh, I love me some Leo.",9,Big Bang Theory,24,6
45490,Leonard,13, And it's gone.,9,Big Bang Theory,15,3
45491,Sheldon,13," Oh, hello, everyone. I am happy to report I'm feeling much better.",9,Big Bang Theory,67,12
45492,Leonard,13, Good for you.,9,Big Bang Theory,14,3
45493,Sheldon,13," My fever is gone, my sinuses are pressure-free, and my mucus is as clear as a Yosemite waterfall.",9,Big Bang Theory,98,18
45494,Howard,13, Glad to hear it.,9,Big Bang Theory,17,4
45495,Sheldon,13, I'll be able to return to work tomorrow.,9,Big Bang Theory,41,8
45496,Raj,13, Yay.,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
45497,Sheldon,13," Well, why isn't everyone happy? Your little ray of sunshine is ready to beam again.",9,Big Bang Theory,84,15
45498,Penny,13, You really don't know why?,9,Big Bang Theory,27,5
45499,Sheldon,13, No. But I knew that his yay was sarcastic. Not bad for a guy whose last bowel movement sounded like rain on a roof.,9,Big Bang Theory,116,24
45500,Leonard,13, Let me refresh your memory.,9,Big Bang Theory,28,5
45501,Sheldon,13," Penny, rub Vicks on my chest.",9,Big Bang Theory,30,6
45502,Penny,13," Sheldon, I cooked you breakfast. I made your bed. I checked your mouth for thrush. You can rub your own chest.",9,Big Bang Theory,111,21
45503,Sheldon,13," Oh, sure, grope every other male on the planet, but draw the line with me.",9,Big Bang Theory,75,15
45505,Sheldon,13," I hope laughter is the best medicine, 'cause this care package is a joke.",9,Big Bang Theory,74,14
45506,Howard,13," Hey, she came all the way here",9,Big Bang Theory,31,7
45508,Raj,13," Sheldon, stop being a baby and let Emily take a look at you.",9,Big Bang Theory,61,13
45509,Sheldon,13, She's a dermatologist.,9,Big Bang Theory,23,3
45511,Sheldon,13," Well, in that case, try removing the irritating patch of brown skin standing next to you.",9,Big Bang Theory,90,16
45512,Leonard,13," All right, here you go.",9,Big Bang Theory,24,5
45513,Sheldon,13," Leonard, I'm dying.",9,Big Bang Theory,20,3
45514,Leonard,13, You're not dying. It's just the flu.,9,Big Bang Theory,37,7
45515,Sheldon,13, I asked for chicken noodle. This is chicken and stars. It's killing me.,9,Big Bang Theory,72,13
45516,Sheldon,13," I never did get that chicken noodle, did I?",9,Big Bang Theory,44,9
45518,Amy,13," Hi, Sheldon.",9,Big Bang Theory,13,2
45519,Sheldon,13, Hello.,9,Big Bang Theory,7,1
45520,Amy,13, Are you feeling any better?,9,Big Bang Theory,28,5
45521,Sheldon,13," Physically, yes, but I'm upset because everyone's mad at me for no good reason.",9,Big Bang Theory,80,14
45522,Amy,13," Why don't you tell me what happened, and in a gentle, loving way, I'll explain to you why you're wrong.",9,Big Bang Theory,104,20
45523,Sheldon,13," You know how, when you're sick, you're allowed to be cranky and say whatever you want and other people's feelings don't matter?",9,Big Bang Theory,128,22
45524,Amy,13," Ooh. Gentle and loving, this is gonna be tricky.",9,Big Bang Theory,49,9
45525,Sheldon,13," I had a hundred and one fever. If that's not a time to verbally abuse my loved ones, when is?",9,Big Bang Theory,94,20
45526,Amy,13," Sheldon, when you're sick, you can be unbearable. That's why your friends have been known to work late or sneak out to the movies or stay at a neurobiology conference three days after it's ended.",9,Big Bang Theory,196,35
45527,Sheldon,13, You stayed in Michigan all week to avoid being around me?,9,Big Bang Theory,58,11
45528,Amy,13," No, no, not just that. I mean, Detroit is beautiful when it's sleeting.",9,Big Bang Theory,72,13
45529,Sheldon,13," You know, I'm not the only one who's unpleasant when they're sick. When Penny got food poisoning, she threw up so loudly I could barely hear the television.",9,Big Bang Theory,157,28
45530,Amy,13," Ooh, I just heard something. Might be hail, might be gunfire. Either way, I'm gonna go take pictures. Bye.",9,Big Bang Theory,107,19
45532,Raj,13," Hey, Stuart.",9,Big Bang Theory,13,2
45534,Leonard,13," No, he's fine. We just needed a little break.",9,Big Bang Theory,46,9
45536,Howard,13, He was being a jerk to everyone. Don't take it personally.,9,Big Bang Theory,59,11
45538,Raj,13, I wish we could do more stuff without Sheldon.,9,Big Bang Theory,47,9
45539,Leonard,13, I wish that all the time. Usually before I blow out birthday candles.,9,Big Bang Theory,70,13
45540,Howard,13," You know, Amy took some time off from him. Really improved their relationship.",9,Big Bang Theory,79,13
45541,Raj,13," Huh. Okay. As long as it doesn't end with us having coitus with him, I'm in.",9,Big Bang Theory,77,16
45542,Howard,13, We should all take a trip or something.,9,Big Bang Theory,40,8
45543,Leonard,13," Well, you know, Penny and I have been talking about taking a weekend in Vegas. Maybe we should all go.",9,Big Bang Theory,103,20
45544,Howard,13, Bernie would love that.,9,Big Bang Theory,24,4
45545,Raj,13," Oh, Ooh, maybe we could get one of those party buses to take us there.",9,Big Bang Theory,71,15
45546,Leonard,13, That sounds really fun.,9,Big Bang Theory,24,4
45547,Raj,13," Yeah, that sounds fun. A party-bus party don't stop. Ooh, when I say party, you say bus.",9,Big Bang Theory,89,17
45548,Leonard,13, No.,9,Big Bang Theory,4,1
45549,Howard,13, No.,9,Big Bang Theory,4,1
45550,Leonard,13, No.,9,Big Bang Theory,4,1
45551,Howard,13, No.,9,Big Bang Theory,4,1
45553,Leonard,13," So, the guys and I were talking about renting a party bus and everyone going to Vegas.",9,Big Bang Theory,87,17
45554,Penny,13," Oh, that could be fun. But just to be clear, you mean a party bus with booze and music, right, not, like, juice boxes and video games?",9,Big Bang Theory,135,27
45555,Leonard,13," Yes. And Howard's birthday was a drop-off party, you didn't have to stay.",9,Big Bang Theory,74,13
45556,Penny,13," Well, I'm in. When are we going?",9,Big Bang Theory,33,7
45557,Leonard,13, This weekend.,9,Big Bang Theory,14,2
45558,Sheldon,13," Oh, where are we going?",9,Big Bang Theory,24,5
45559,Leonard,13," Well, Vegas, but",9,Big Bang Theory,17,3
45560,Sheldon,13," Ugh, Atlantic City without the taffy? No, thank you.",9,Big Bang Theory,53,9
45561,Leonard,13," That's fine, 'cause actually you're not invited.",9,Big Bang Theory,49,7
45562,Sheldon,13," Well, now, well, that's hurtful.",9,Big Bang Theory,33,5
45563,Penny,13," Oh, Sheldon, you don't even like it there.",9,Big Bang Theory,43,8
45564,Sheldon,13, I can consider a place America's urinal cake and still enjoy the occasional visit.,9,Big Bang Theory,83,14
45565,Leonard,13, Not this time.,9,Big Bang Theory,15,3
45566,Sheldon,13," Oh, fine. Then I'll just hang out with Wolowitz.",9,Big Bang Theory,49,9
45567,Leonard,13," He's coming, too.",9,Big Bang Theory,18,3
45568,Sheldon,13," Well, then Raj and I will",9,Big Bang Theory,26,6
45569,Leonard,13, Nope.,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
45570,Sheldon,13, Very well. Stuart.,9,Big Bang Theory,19,3
45571,Leonard,13," Oh, great. Do that.",9,Big Bang Theory,20,4
45572,Sheldon,13, Ugh. Stuart.,9,Big Bang Theory,13,2
45574,Amy,13," Hi, Sheldon. What's new?",9,Big Bang Theory,25,4
45575,Sheldon,13," Our friends are jerks, and I'm mad at all of them.",9,Big Bang Theory,51,11
45576,Amy,13," I said what's new, but sure.",9,Big Bang Theory,29,6
45577,Sheldon,13, Can you believe they planned a trip to Las Vegas and didn't invite me?,9,Big Bang Theory,71,14
45578,Amy,13, Did you refuse to apologize and act like they were stupid for being mad?,9,Big Bang Theory,73,14
45579,Sheldon,13," You know, I liked it better when there was still a little mystery left in our relationship.",9,Big Bang Theory,92,17
45580,Amy,13," Everyone tried to take care of you, and you were nothing but mean to them.",9,Big Bang Theory,75,15
45581,Sheldon,13, I can't believe you're not on my side. I was on your side when someone stole your car radio.,9,Big Bang Theory,93,19
45582,Amy,13, Who else's side could you have been on?,9,Big Bang Theory,40,8
45583,Sheldon,13, I don't know. A music-loving hobo with a heart of gold?,9,Big Bang Theory,56,11
45584,Amy,13," Sheldon, I understand that you're upset because you feel left out, but I don't know why we're even talking about this. Just apologize to them.",9,Big Bang Theory,143,25
45585,Sheldon,13," Fine, if that's what it takes to go on their dumb trip.",9,Big Bang Theory,56,12
45586,Amy,13, Maybe you could try apologizing because you actually feel bad. It's called empathy. It's something you could work on.,9,Big Bang Theory,118,19
45587,Sheldon,13," I have empathy. Watch. Leonard made me soup, and I was mean to him.",9,Big Bang Theory,68,14
45588,Amy,13, Great. Now try it as if this isn't your first day as a person.,9,Big Bang Theory,63,14
45589,Sheldon,13," Fine. Leonard made me soup, and I was mean to him. Hey, I felt a little something. Let me try again. Leonard made me soup, and I was mean to him. I was mean to him. He must have felt terrible. Oh, now I feel terrible. Neat.",9,Big Bang Theory,224,47
45590,Amy,13, Glad I could help.,9,Big Bang Theory,19,4
45591,Sheldon,13, Now let me see you feel bad for lying and staying in Detroit longer than you needed to.,9,Big Bang Theory,88,18
45592,Amy,13," I feel so, so bad.",9,Big Bang Theory,19,5
45593,Sheldon,13," Hey, we're both great at this.",9,Big Bang Theory,31,6
45595,Sheldon,13," Leonard, get ready for an apology. And with the added twist of an M. Night Shyamalan movie, I'm going to mean it.",9,Big Bang Theory,114,22
45596,Leonard,13," Ah, so like every other M. Night Shyamalan movie I've seen, you spoil it in advance.",9,Big Bang Theory,85,16
45597,Sheldon,13," Hey, if you didn't know Bruce Willis was dead the whole time, that's not on me. Okay. Here it comes. You tried to take care of me when I was sick, and I was mean to you. There's no excuse for that. And I'm truly sorry.",9,Big Bang Theory,219,46
45598,Leonard,13, Thank you. I appreciate that.,9,Big Bang Theory,30,5
45599,Sheldon,13, I want you to know that that is sincere. I do feel bad. I'm not just saying it to be included on your trip.,9,Big Bang Theory,108,24
45600,Leonard,13," Appreciate that, too.",9,Big Bang Theory,22,3
45601,Sheldon,13," Terrific. Now all that's left is for you to invite me to come, me to ask are you sure, you to say absolutely, and then me to bring it home with, how could I say no to that face?",9,Big Bang Theory,178,39
45602,Leonard,13, You're still not coming.,9,Big Bang Theory,25,4
45603,Sheldon,13," What? I apologized and I meant it. I know that we don't play this game very often, but you're doing it wrong.",9,Big Bang Theory,110,22
45604,Leonard,13," Sheldon, I accept your apology, but you upset a lot of people while you were sick. I'm not in a position to just say you can come.",9,Big Bang Theory,131,27
45605,Sheldon,13," Well, all right. What if I apologize to all of them?",9,Big Bang Theory,53,11
45606,Leonard,13," Fine, if you apologize to everyone, they all say it's okay, then yes, you can come.",9,Big Bang Theory,84,16
45607,Sheldon,13, Challenge accepted. Sounds like it's time for the Sheldon Cooper Apology Tour.,9,Big Bang Theory,79,12
45608,Leonard,13," Well, I hope it's as much fun as the Sheldon Cooper Spell-Checks Local Menus Tour.",9,Big Bang Theory,83,15
45609,Sheldon,13," My goodness, do you remember comes with apsparagus?",9,Big Bang Theory,52,8
45611,Sheldon,13," Howard and Bernadette, you tried to comfort me when I was ill, and I treated you terribly. I'm sorry.",9,Big Bang Theory,102,19
45612,Howard,13, Wow. I'm impressed.,9,Big Bang Theory,20,3
45613,Sheldon,13," No, no, no, wait. I'm not done. Allow me to underscore my sentiment with a haunting rendition of Brenda Lee's I'm Sorry played on the pan flute.",9,Big Bang Theory,145,27
45614,Howard,13, Apology accepted.,9,Big Bang Theory,18,2
45616,Sheldon,13," All right, that's eight hours of practice down the drain. And to memorialise this occasion, here are your commemorative T-shirts.",9,Big Bang Theory,130,20
45617,Howard,13, Sheldon Cooper apologized to me,9,Big Bang Theory,32,5
45620,Sheldon,13," All you did was offer maternal care and affection, and all you received in return was rude and insensitive behavior.",9,Big Bang Theory,117,20
45621,Penny,13, Can this wait?,9,Big Bang Theory,15,3
45622,Sheldon,13, I'm afraid it can't. The trip is tomorrow. And I have more apologies to make.,9,Big Bang Theory,78,15
45623,Penny,13," Okay, fine, I accept your apology, now get out.",9,Big Bang Theory,48,9
45624,Sheldon,13, Wonderful. would you mind holding up this shirt while I take a quick?,9,Big Bang Theory,70,13
45625,Penny,13, Leonard.,9,Big Bang Theory,9,1
45627,Sheldon,13," You brought me my comic books when I wasn't feeling well. That, that was thoughtful. And I was insensitive. I'm sorry.",9,Big Bang Theory,119,21
45629,Sheldon,13," And I want you to know that I mean it, you know? This isn't me just wanting to go on the trip to Las Vegas.",9,Big Bang Theory,108,25
45631,Sheldon,13, The one everyone's taking this weekend on the party bus.,9,Big Bang Theory,57,10
45633,Sheldon,13," That would be my understanding. On a less painful subject, what size T-shirt do you take?",9,Big Bang Theory,90,16
45635,Sheldon,13," Raj, you were being a good friend, and my illness was no excuse for my behaviour. I hope that you can accept my apology.",9,Big Bang Theory,121,24
45636,Raj,13, Of course I do.,9,Big Bang Theory,16,4
45637,Sheldon,13," And, Emily, I'm sorry for saying dermatologists aren't real doctors. And I'm sure you're tired of hearing that.",9,Big Bang Theory,112,18
45639,Sheldon,13," Well, I would imagine when your job is popping zits and squirting Botox into old lady faces",9,Big Bang Theory,92,17
45640,Raj,13," Okay, okay, the point is that we accept your apology.",9,Big Bang Theory,54,10
45642,Raj,13," Yeah, but he doesn't mean it.",9,Big Bang Theory,30,6
45644,Sheldon,13," I believe I can answer that. Uh, like me, Raj is demonstrating empathy. Now, why don't you accept my apology receive your free T-shirt, uh, I hope extra small is okay. For some reason Wolowitz took a medium.",9,Big Bang Theory,208,38
45646,Raj,13, What are you doing?,9,Big Bang Theory,20,4
45648,Raj,13," Fine, how about this? You're making me uncomfortable by prolonging this ridiculous fight, and I wish you'd stop.",9,Big Bang Theory,113,18
45650,Raj,13," No, come on, please don't leave.",9,Big Bang Theory,33,6
45651,Sheldon,13," Point of clarification, are you still going on the trip? Because if not",9,Big Bang Theory,72,13
45653,Sheldon,13," I caused that fight, I feel terrible. Wait, I can do that better. I caused that fight. I feel terrible. Yeah, wow, I don't know which one I like more.",9,Big Bang Theory,151,30
45655,Penny,13," So, was the fight really bad?",9,Big Bang Theory,30,6
45656,Sheldon,13," No. As a fight, it was excellent. She used harsh language and slammed the door. Although as I say this, that might not have been what you were asking.",9,Big Bang Theory,151,29
45657,Leonard,13, You think they'll still go on the trip?,9,Big Bang Theory,40,8
45658,Sheldon,13, All I know is after the fight I went to Emily's to smooth,9,Big Bang Theory,58,13
45659,Leonard,13, They're not going on the trip.,9,Big Bang Theory,31,6
45660,Penny,13, No.,9,Big Bang Theory,4,1
45661,Raj,13, What is wrong with you?,9,Big Bang Theory,24,5
45662,Sheldon,13," Look at him, caring about what's wrong with me. That is some top-shelf empathy. Hey, well, we should start a club.",9,Big Bang Theory,115,21
45663,Raj,13," You went to Emily's to apologise, and when you left, she was crying.",9,Big Bang Theory,69,13
45664,Sheldon,13," That is true. Well, I suppose I should apologize again.",9,Big Bang Theory,56,10
45666,Penny,13, Is she okay?,9,Big Bang Theory,13,3
45667,Raj,13," Yeah, I calmed her down, but she's not going to Vegas if he's going.",9,Big Bang Theory,69,14
45668,Howard,13," Wait, that's an option? I didn't know that was an option.",9,Big Bang Theory,58,11
45669,Sheldon,13," Well, that is fine, because I've decided that I won't be joining you. I've realized that the most genuine way to demonstrate the remorse I feel is to let you have this weekend to yourselves.",9,Big Bang Theory,191,35
45670,Raj,13, That's very mature of you.,9,Big Bang Theory,27,5
45671,Sheldon,13," Well, I've been on a little trip myself recently. Not to Sin City but to Sincere City. Where instead of genital warts, the only growth you'll come back with is personal growth.",9,Big Bang Theory,177,32
45672,Penny,13, And there's your next T-shirt.,9,Big Bang Theory,31,5
45674,Howard,13," Ooh, check out the stripper pole.",9,Big Bang Theory,34,6
45676,Leonard,13, That Raj'll be on it before we make it to the freeway?,9,Big Bang Theory,55,12
45677,Raj,13," You know it. Oo-ah, oo-ah.",9,Big Bang Theory,27,5
45679,Penny,13, Here's some champagne.,9,Big Bang Theory,23,3
45680,Leonard,13," Mm-hmm. Well, I would like to propose a toast to a well-deserved weekend of",9,Big Bang Theory,76,14
45681,Sheldon,13, Aha.,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
45682,Leonard,13, What are you doing?,9,Big Bang Theory,20,4
45683,Sheldon,13," My plan was to jump out at the state line, but one of my nose plugs fell into the toilet.",9,Big Bang Theory,90,20
45684,Penny,13, You couldn't give us just one weekend?,9,Big Bang Theory,39,7
45686,Leonard,13," What do we do, kick them off?",9,Big Bang Theory,30,7
45687,Penny,13," If we drop them off at a fire station, they have to take them, no questions asked.",9,Big Bang Theory,83,17
45688,Sheldon,13," Before you do, please give me one more chance to apologize to Emily.",9,Big Bang Theory,69,13
45689,Raj,13," Oh, God.",9,Big Bang Theory,9,2
45690,Sheldon,13," Emily, as I'm sure you know, I'm considered an odd fellow. But what you don't know is that, while I often say the wrong thing, in my heart I mean well. I think that you are a smart and wonderful woman, you know? And we all think that you can do better than Koothrappali.",9,Big Bang Theory,271,54
45691,Raj,13," You know, Sheldon",9,Big Bang Theory,18,3
45693,Sheldon,13," So, for all the times I've offended you and all the times that I'll offend you in the future, I'm sorry.",9,Big Bang Theory,105,21
45695,Sheldon,13, Good. Then I'll be leaving now.,9,Big Bang Theory,32,6
45697,Sheldon,13," Oh, that's very kind of you. But I'm sure you'll all have a better time without me. Let's go, Stuart.",9,Big Bang Theory,102,20
45699,Sheldon,13," Stuart, now.",9,Big Bang Theory,13,2
45701,Penny,13, And now you see the problem.,9,Big Bang Theory,29,6
45702,Leonard,13," Come on, you pain in the ass.",9,Big Bang Theory,30,7
45703,Sheldon,13," That's me. Bye, Stuart.",9,Big Bang Theory,24,4
45706,Sheldon,13, Are you relieved that you and Raj were able to patch things up?,9,Big Bang Theory,64,13
45708,Penny,13," Shake it, baby.",9,Big Bang Theory,16,3
45711,Sheldon,14," Here's a fun Postal fact. The inner side of our mailbox is under federal jurisdiction. So, if you broke my right thumb, that's Pasadena city police. But if you broke my left thumb, that's the FBI.",9,Big Bang Theory,197,36
45712,Leonard,14," If I'm going to jail, I'm killing him, not breaking his thumb.",9,Big Bang Theory,63,12
45713,Penny,14, Yeah.,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
45714,Sheldon,14," Oh, I got a letter from my Meemaw. Umm. Smell this.",9,Big Bang Theory,52,11
45715,Penny,14, What is that?,9,Big Bang Theory,14,3
45716,Sheldon,14," Uh, roses, bengay, and Dr. Scholls' foot powder.",9,Big Bang Theory,49,8
45717,Penny,14," Ah, yeah, Grandma by Calvin Klein. You know, the last time I got a hand written letter it was from someone who told me I parked like a blind person.",9,Big Bang Theory,149,30
45718,Leonard,14, That someone has a name.,9,Big Bang Theory,25,5
45719,Sheldon,14," Uh, thank you. Oh, Meemaw got a new set of teeth. Oh, but then she found her old ones. Oh, so now the new ones are just gonna be her church teeth.",9,Big Bang Theory,147,32
45720,Leonard,14, Fun. Like your Comic-Con Spock ears and your around the house Spock ears.,9,Big Bang Theory,74,13
45721,Penny,14, I park fine.,9,Big Bang Theory,13,3
45722,Sheldon,14," Oh, my goodness, she's coming to visit!",9,Big Bang Theory,40,7
45723,Leonard,14," Oh, it'll be nice to finally meet her.",9,Big Bang Theory,39,8
45724,Sheldon,14," Oh, you are going to love her. She is the kindest, sweetest woman you'll ever meet. Unless you're a gopher digging up her vegetable garden. In that case, you can expect to have your head bashed in with a shovel.",9,Big Bang Theory,212,40
45726,Sheldon,14, That's not her. That's not her. That's not her. That's not her. That's not her. That's not her. That's not her. That's not her.,9,Big Bang Theory,128,24
45727,Leonard,14, Really? The old Asian man is not your Meemaw?,9,Big Bang Theory,46,9
45728,Sheldon,14," And that's not helpful. You know, I got her an iPhone for Christmas. I'll see where she is.",9,Big Bang Theory,92,18
45729,Leonard,14," Oh, that's nice. Most people her age don't embrace technology.",9,Big Bang Theory,63,10
45730,Sheldon,14," Oh, no, she doesn't even know she has it. No, I had my sister slip it in her bag so that I can track her like a sea turtle.",9,Big Bang Theory,124,29
45731,Leonard,14, Same as when we lost you at the zoo.,9,Big Bang Theory,37,9
45732,Sheldon,14," Uh, for the hundredth time, I smelled kettle corn and couldn't find the cart.",9,Big Bang Theory,78,14
45733,Leonard,14, Still doesn't explain how you ended up on the freeway divider.,9,Big Bang Theory,63,11
45735,Sheldon,14, Meemaw. I'm so happy to see you.,9,Big Bang Theory,33,7
45737,Sheldon,14," Oh. You got even smaller. I love it. Uh, Meemaw, this is Leonard. Leonard, this is my Meemaw.",9,Big Bang Theory,94,18
45738,Leonard,14," Hi. So nice to finally meet you. Let me take this for you, Meemaw.",9,Big Bang Theory,67,14
45740,Sheldon,14," No. Oh, no. Now you call her Constance. I call her Meemaw. You have your own Meemaw. It's not my fault she died when you were four.",9,Big Bang Theory,132,27
45742,Sheldon,14," It isn't, Meemaw. Sorry, Leonard.",9,Big Bang Theory,34,5
45743,Leonard,14, Can you please live with us forever?,9,Big Bang Theory,37,7
45745,Howard,14," That's ridiculous. If you had a superpower, and spent your whole life being told to suppress it, when you finally decide to embrace that power, why hide in isolation?",9,Big Bang Theory,167,29
45746,Raj,14," I'm sorry, and how much money did your version of Frozen make?",9,Big Bang Theory,63,12
45747,Howard,14," I'm just saying, instead of Let it Go, she should really sing, Look At Me Hiding in a Freezer Like a Dove Bar.",9,Big Bang Theory,111,23
45748,Raj,14," She built an ice castle, made a snow monster and gave herself a complete makeover in one day. You know what I saw you do today? Eat a block of cream cheese straight from the foil and lie about it to your wife.",9,Big Bang Theory,210,43
45750,Raj,14," Yeah, that's true. In fact, they liked the song so much, they retooled the whole script around it.",9,Big Bang Theory,99,18
45752,Howard,14," Here we are talking about Frozen, and yet, you got burned.",9,Big Bang Theory,59,11
45753,Raj,14," I'm so sorry but, how can you not like that movie?",9,Big Bang Theory,51,11
45755,Howard,14," Oh, that's what I said an hour ago.",9,Big Bang Theory,36,8
45757,Howard,14, You should've seen us after The Good Dinosaur.,9,Big Bang Theory,47,8
45758,Raj,14," It was a classic western set in the post-Jurassic period, and it changed my life.",9,Big Bang Theory,82,15
45760,Sheldon,14, Are you comfortable?,9,Big Bang Theory,21,3
45762,Sheldon,14," You were so cute, huffin' and puffin'. There's Amy. I just know you're gonna hit it off. You both have the same fashion sense. Hello. Come in, say hi to my Meemaw.",9,Big Bang Theory,164,32
45763,Amy,14, Hi. Nice to meet you.,9,Big Bang Theory,22,5
45765,Amy,14, How was your trip?,9,Big Bang Theory,19,4
45767,Amy,14," That's great. And look at you, sitting in Sheldon's spot. You know, I don't even get to sit there.",9,Big Bang Theory,99,19
45768,Sheldon,14," Yeah. And you never will. Ooh, hey, oh, ask her to do the tissue thing. Do it, ask her.",9,Big Bang Theory,88,19
45769,Amy,14, Can I have a tissue?,9,Big Bang Theory,21,5
45771,Sheldon,14, Isn't that the best? She's like Grandma Spider-Man.,9,Big Bang Theory,52,8
45773,Sheldon,14," Oh, well, you two sit down and get to know each other. I'll get your room ready.",9,Big Bang Theory,81,17
45775,Sheldon,14," If I did, would I find any?",9,Big Bang Theory,28,7
45777,Sheldon,14, That's a risk I'm willing to take.,9,Big Bang Theory,35,7
45778,Amy,14," Well, this is so nice. He's so excited to have you here and",9,Big Bang Theory,60,13
45780,Amy,14," S, s, si, size me up?",9,Big Bang Theory,22,6

45786,Sheldon,14," Amy, why don't you look excited? Well, you get to watch me play with this.",9,Big Bang Theory,75,15
45788,Raj,14," Oh, I see you're reading Saga.",9,Big Bang Theory,31,6
45790,Raj,14," It is, and not a lot of comics have a woman with wings breastfeeding a baby right on the cover.",9,Big Bang Theory,96,20
45792,Howard,14, You should. He's really looked.,9,Big Bang Theory,32,5
45793,Raj,14," I'm Raj, by the way. This is Howard.",9,Big Bang Theory,37,8
45794,Howard,14, Hi.,9,Big Bang Theory,4,1
45796,Raj,14," Well, I've never seen you here before, Claire.",9,Big Bang Theory,47,8
45798,Howard,14, You're a screenwriter?,9,Big Bang Theory,23,3
45800,Raj,14," Yeah, I get that. I'm a scientist, slash party planner, slash small-dog enthusiast, slash guy who probably should have stopped at scientist.",9,Big Bang Theory,141,22
45802,Raj,14," Well, astrophysicist.",9,Big Bang Theory,22,2
45804,Raj,14, Sure. I love animated movies.,9,Big Bang Theory,30,5
45805,Howard,14," He does, and he has the Lilo & Stitch collector plates to prove it.",9,Big Bang Theory,68,14
45806,Raj,14, Excuse me for wanting a little magic in my life.,9,Big Bang Theory,49,10
45808,Raj,14," Yeah, great.",9,Big Bang Theory,13,2
45810,Raj,14," Yeah, bye.",9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
45811,Howard,14, What are you doing? You have a girlfriend.,9,Big Bang Theory,43,8
45812,Raj,14, So?,9,Big Bang Theory,4,1
45813,Howard,14," So, how do you think she'd feel about you helping a beautiful girl with her screenplay?",9,Big Bang Theory,88,16
45814,Raj,14, I wouldn't say she's beautiful.,9,Big Bang Theory,32,5
45815,Howard,14, Really? You don't think she's attractive?,9,Big Bang Theory,42,6
45816,Raj,14, I do. I just wouldn't tell my girlfriend.,9,Big Bang Theory,42,8
45818,Penny,14," Constance, are you sure I can't pour you some wine?",9,Big Bang Theory,52,10
45820,Sheldon,14," Here you go, Meemaw. I made it just how you like, a lot in a glass.",9,Big Bang Theory,68,16
45822,Amy,14, I'm curious. Why do you call Sheldon Moon Pie?,9,Big Bang Theory,47,9
45825,Sheldon,14," And I call her Meemaw because, well, just, well, look at her.",9,Big Bang Theory,62,12
45827,Amy,14," Oh, well, you know, now, now that I'm hearing it, it does sound familiar.",9,Big Bang Theory,74,14
45828,Sheldon,14," How could it? I never told you, and you never bothered to ask.",9,Big Bang Theory,63,13
45829,Amy,14," Well, now I know.",9,Big Bang Theory,18,4
45830,Sheldon,14, Yeah.,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
45832,Penny,14, Yes. I'm a pharmaceutical sales rep.,9,Big Bang Theory,37,6
45834,Amy,14," I have a relationship and a full-time career, too.",9,Big Bang Theory,51,9
45836,Amy,14," Why not? You, you just said it's okay for her to work.",9,Big Bang Theory,55,12
45838,Leonard,14, That's my best friend.,9,Big Bang Theory,23,4
45839,Penny,14, Yeah.,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
45840,Amy,14," Look, I, I get that you're protective of your grandson, but he's an adult now. Maybe I understand what he needs better than you do.",9,Big Bang Theory,132,25
45842,Amy,14, Thank you.,9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
45844,Amy,14," Well, maybe I don't like you either.",9,Big Bang Theory,37,7
45845,Amy,14, I think I should leave.,9,Big Bang Theory,24,5
45846,Sheldon,14," But why? Other than you two fighting, we're having such a good time.",9,Big Bang Theory,69,13
45847,Amy,14," The minute you left the room, your precious meemaw started giving me a really hard time. I don't need this.",9,Big Bang Theory,108,20
45849,Amy,14, What ring?,9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
45850,Leonard,14, Maybe we should give them some privacy.,9,Big Bang Theory,40,7
45851,Penny,14," Yeah, yeah, yeah. You go ahead. I'll catch up with you.",9,Big Bang Theory,56,11
45852,Amy,14, You have an engagement ring?,9,Big Bang Theory,29,5
45853,Sheldon,14, Yes.,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
45854,Amy,14," Penny, did you know about this?",9,Big Bang Theory,32,6
45855,Penny,14," All right, let's go.",9,Big Bang Theory,21,4
45856,Amy,14, When did you get an engagement ring?,9,Big Bang Theory,37,7
45857,Sheldon,14," My mother gave it to me, and I had been thinking about giving it to you, but then we broke up.",9,Big Bang Theory,95,21
45859,Amy,14," Sheldon, will you please tell your grandmother to stay out of this?",9,Big Bang Theory,68,12
45860,Sheldon,14," Oh, I don't think I could do that.",9,Big Bang Theory,35,8
45862,Sheldon,14," I'm gonna opt out of that one, too.",9,Big Bang Theory,36,8
45863,Amy,14," Who said I even want to be engaged to him? And if I do, I, I don't need your hand-me-downs.",9,Big Bang Theory,92,20
45864,Sheldon,14," All right, all right, look, l, let's all, let's remain calm and analyse this situation. Now, I realize that you've only known each other for less than a day, but is it possible this crankiness is because your cycles have synced?",9,Big Bang Theory,229,41
45866,Amy,14, Don't speak to him like he's a child.,9,Big Bang Theory,38,8
45867,Sheldon,14, Thank you. I'm gonna go next door and play with Leonard.,9,Big Bang Theory,57,11
45870,Raj,14, Just to help her with her screenplay.,9,Big Bang Theory,38,7
45872,Howard,14, You weren't there. He was really flirting.,9,Big Bang Theory,43,7
45873,Raj,14," Hey, it's not my fault if American women project their fantasies on foreigners with the kind of magical voice that grants wishes.",9,Big Bang Theory,130,22
45875,Howard,14, Really? So it's okay if I fl,9,Big Bang Theory,29,7
45877,Raj,14," Uh, it's hard to say. I think we're good, but things like this make me wonder if Emily's really the right person for me. I mean, did you guys ever have doubts about each other?",9,Big Bang Theory,177,35
45878,Howard,14, No. Never.,9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
45880,Howard,14, What?,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
45882,Howard,14," Fine. I had reservations about you, too.",9,Big Bang Theory,41,7
45884,Howard,14," No, I didn't.",9,Big Bang Theory,14,3
45886,Howard,14," Me, too. And I think you're even more beautiful than this rose.",9,Big Bang Theory,64,12
45888,Penny,14," Wow. You know, the last time I saw my grandma, the most exciting thing was watching the ash of her cigarette get longer and wondering if it was gonna fall in her pudding.",9,Big Bang Theory,171,33
45889,Leonard,14, Did it?,9,Big Bang Theory,8,2
45890,Penny,14," Yeah, right in there. She ate it and everything.",9,Big Bang Theory,49,9
45891,Sheldon,14,  Leonard and Penny.  Leonard and Penny.  Leonard and Penny.,9,Big Bang Theory,60,9
45892,Penny,14, Come in.,9,Big Bang Theory,9,2
45893,Leonard,14, Hey. What happened? Is Amy gone?,9,Big Bang Theory,33,6
45894,Sheldon,14, No. They asked me to leave so they could speak privately.,9,Big Bang Theory,58,11
45895,Penny,14, Uh-oh.,9,Big Bang Theory,7,1
45896,Sheldon,14," Yeah, I know. It was quite tense. So here's the million dollar question, uh, who wants to pop over there and get my trains?",9,Big Bang Theory,124,24
45898,Raj,14," All right. I've made up my mind. I'm gonna do the right thing, call this girl, and let her know that I'm in a relationship.",9,Big Bang Theory,124,25
45899,Howard,14," Okay, so far we've heard, made up my mind I'm dumping Emily.",9,Big Bang Theory,61,12
45901,Howard,14," And made up my mind, I'll ask for a threesome and if they say no, play it off as a joke.",9,Big Bang Theory,89,21
45902,Raj,14, I'm calling her. And the threesome didn't deserve the belly laugh it got.,9,Big Bang Theory,74,13
45905,Raj,14," Hi. Hi. Yeah, it's Raj. Rajesh. We met at the comic book store.",9,Big Bang Theory,64,13
45907,Raj,14," Actually, that's why I'm calling. I, um, I just, I need to let you know that I have a girlfriend.",9,Big Bang Theory,98,20
45909,Raj,14," Well, no, no. I, I didn't want to mislead you after you asked me out.",9,Big Bang Theory,70,15
45911,Raj,14," Wait, are you saying that we didn't have a vibe?",9,Big Bang Theory,49,10
45913,Raj,14," Come on, I just told you I had a girlfriend. The least you can do is tell me if we had a vibe.",9,Big Bang Theory,95,23
45915,Raj,14," I knew it. Okay, we did have a vibe. This is exciting. What's my next move?",9,Big Bang Theory,76,16
45917,Raj,14," Right. Good catch. Anyway, so I'm sorry to waste your time. And, uh, and good luck with your screenplay.",9,Big Bang Theory,105,19
45919,Raj,14," Not me. Ever since you admitted we had a vibe, I've been planning our wedding.",9,Big Bang Theory,79,15
45921,Raj,14," Okay. That hurts a little, but okay.",9,Big Bang Theory,37,7
45923,Raj,14," Bye. All right. So, uh, we're meeting for coffee like two adults. Everybody's happy. Easy peasy.",9,Big Bang Theory,97,16
45925,Raj,14," Yeah, of course. We have no secrets.",9,Big Bang Theory,37,7
45926,Howard,14, When are you gonna tell Emily?,9,Big Bang Theory,31,6
45927,Raj,14, He lied about the cream cheese. He ate the whole thing. I saw him.,9,Big Bang Theory,67,14
45929,Amy,14," Look, I know you think I'm not right for Sheldon, but trust me, I'm his best shot. You have no idea how much I put up with.",9,Big Bang Theory,124,27
45931,Amy,14, Really? You know what it's like to have date night ruined because Google changed their font?,9,Big Bang Theory,93,16
45933,Amy,14, Really?,9,Big Bang Theory,8,1
45935,Amy,14," Well, if you understand, then why are you giving me such a hard time?",9,Big Bang Theory,70,14
45937,Penny,14, Hi. Sorry. Sheldon would like to say something to you.,9,Big Bang Theory,55,10
45938,Sheldon,14," No, I wouldn't.",9,Big Bang Theory,16,3
45939,Leonard,14, Just get in here.,9,Big Bang Theory,18,4
45940,Sheldon,14, Hello.,9,Big Bang Theory,7,1
45941,Penny,14, Go ahead.,9,Big Bang Theory,10,2

45943,Amy,14," Oh, Sheldon, thank you.",9,Big Bang Theory,24,4
45944,Sheldon,14," Oh, great, now you're gonna get emotional. I always looked up to you and Pop-Pop. I, I know what a challenging man he could be, but I saw you stand by him and-and make him into a better person.",9,Big Bang Theory,194,39
45946,Sheldon,14," Yeah, well, that is exactly what I've been doing the last five years with this little work in progress.",9,Big Bang Theory,104,19
45947,Leonard,14," He never disappoints, does he?",9,Big Bang Theory,31,5
45948,Amy,14, I think what Sheldon means to say is we've both grown together. Isn't that right?,9,Big Bang Theory,82,15
45949,Sheldon,14, Well,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
45950,Penny,14, Say yes.,9,Big Bang Theory,9,2
45951,Sheldon,14, Yes.,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
45953,Sheldon,14, Thank you.,9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
45954,Amy,14," So if he wanted to give me that engagement ring, we would have your blessing?",9,Big Bang Theory,78,15
45956,Sheldon,14," I just gave you my virginity, woman. Cool your jets.",9,Big Bang Theory,53,10
45958,Raj,14," Yeah, see, if you just change the story to the destruction of our galaxy, then a super massive black hole could work.",9,Big Bang Theory,118,22
45960,Raj,14, And that's how Mommy and Daddy met.,9,Big Bang Theory,36,7
45962,Raj,14, I will.,9,Big Bang Theory,8,2

45969,Leonard,15," Penny and I have dinner reservations that night, but any other time, no.",9,Big Bang Theory,73,13
45970,Howard,15," Sorry, Bernie and I are breaking in the new hot tub, if you know what I mean.",9,Big Bang Theory,78,17
45971,Sheldon,15, Not a clue. Raj?,9,Big Bang Theory,17,4
45972,Raj,15, Spending Valentine's Day with Emily.,9,Big Bang Theory,37,5
45973,Leonard,15, You don't sound very excited about it.,9,Big Bang Theory,39,7
45974,Raj,15," Oh, I am, I am. I, I guess I'm still wondering if Emily and I are right for each other.",9,Big Bang Theory,88,20
45975,Howard,15, Does this have to do with that girl you had coffee with?,9,Big Bang Theory,57,12
45976,Raj,15," You mean the strong, sexy angel I can't stop thinking about? Who can say?",9,Big Bang Theory,74,14
45977,Howard,15, You've been talking about breaking up with Emily forever. Why don't you just do it already?,9,Big Bang Theory,92,16
45978,Leonard,15," Yeah, just get it over with.",9,Big Bang Theory,29,6
45979,Raj,15," Well, you say it like it's easy. Have any one of you ever broken up with anyone?",9,Big Bang Theory,81,17
45980,Howard,15, No.,9,Big Bang Theory,4,1
45981,Leonard,15, Not really.,9,Big Bang Theory,12,2

45985,Raj,15," Yeah, I think so. Do you have any advice?",9,Big Bang Theory,42,9
45986,Penny,15," Well, I have broken up with my fair share of guys. I mean, how many times did I break up with Leonard?",9,Big Bang Theory,103,22
45987,Leonard,15, I stopped counting at four.,9,Big Bang Theory,28,5
45988,Penny,15," All right, my advice to you is do it at her place so you can leave when you need to, uh, tell the truth, make it quick and be prepared for tears.",9,Big Bang Theory,146,32
45989,Raj,15," Oh, I'm gonna do a pre-cry before I go in there. Really dry myself out.",9,Big Bang Theory,72,15
45990,Leonard,15, She meant Emily.,9,Big Bang Theory,17,3
45991,Penny,15," No, I, I really didn't.",9,Big Bang Theory,24,5

46020,Howard,15," Sorry, but too hot is the only temperature I come in.",9,Big Bang Theory,54,11
46022,Howard,15," You're welcome. Um, question, this is my first hot tub, is it supposed to come with a rat flopping around in it?",9,Big Bang Theory,113,22
46024,Howard,15, How?,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
46026,Howard,15," Uh, you turn off the jets, I'll get a strainer from the kitchen.",9,Big Bang Theory,65,13
46028,Howard,15," Good, I don't know where we keep the strainer.",9,Big Bang Theory,47,9

46032,Leonard,15, I know.,9,Big Bang Theory,8,2
46033,Penny,15, So what did you say?,9,Big Bang Theory,21,5
46034,Leonard,15," Thanks, sorry to bother you. But I said it like a badass.",9,Big Bang Theory,58,12
46035,Penny,15," All right, well, can't you, like, slip him some money or something?",9,Big Bang Theory,68,12
46036,Leonard,15, Really? I've never done that before. Does it work?,9,Big Bang Theory,51,9
46037,Penny,15, Do people like money? Is that what you're asking?,9,Big Bang Theory,50,9
46038,Leonard,15, A lot of attitude from the woman who thought MC squared was a rapper.,9,Big Bang Theory,70,14
46039,Penny,15," Now, is that a smart thing to say on a holiday that's basically national sex night?",9,Big Bang Theory,84,16
46040,Leonard,15," I'm sorry. You're pretty, I'm stupid. Hello. Uh, just checking again for Hofstadter. Still gonna be an hour?",9,Big Bang Theory,109,18

46053,Amy,15," Since we're live, you'll finally be able to reach out to us with your flag thoughts and flag questions.",9,Big Bang Theory,104,19
46054,Sheldon,15," Allow us to answer a few quick ones that we get all the time. Uh, uh, yes, I really am a doctor. Uh, yes, she really is my girlfriend.",9,Big Bang Theory,135,29
46055,Amy,15," No, I just blink a lot, it's not Morse code for rescue me. Oh, uh, ok, uh, here's our first call. Hello, and welcome to Fun With Flags. What's your question?",9,Big Bang Theory,158,31
46056,Raj,15, What is wrong with me? Why am I so self-destructive?,9,Big Bang Theory,53,10
46057,Amy,15, Rajesh?,9,Big Bang Theory,8,1
46058,Raj,15," Yes. Whenever things are going well, I always find a way to ruin it. You two look happy, how do you do it?",9,Big Bang Theory,107,23

46060,Sheldon,15," You know what, that's not a flag question. Next caller.",9,Big Bang Theory,56,10
46062,Howard,15," I hope you don't think I'm just saying this because it's Valentine's Day, but, I love you so much.",9,Big Bang Theory,99,19
46064,Howard,15," Well, should we put it back in there a few minutes?",9,Big Bang Theory,52,11
46066,Howard,15," Well, how do we do that?",9,Big Bang Theory,25,6
46068,Howard,15," Um, taking care of injured rabbit. Okay. Make sure it's comfortable and warm. Well, it was just in a hot tub. I'm gonna say check.",9,Big Bang Theory,131,25
46070,Howard,15," To make sure it's not dehydrated, feed him an electrolyte solution. If it's not responding, use a warm cloth to wash its face and genitals. Yeah.",9,Big Bang Theory,146,26
46072,Penny,15," This is ridiculous. You know, I'm gonna go talk to the maÃ®tre d'.",9,Big Bang Theory,67,13

46077,Leonard,15, See if you can get a table by the window.,9,Big Bang Theory,42,10
46078,Penny,15, Hi there. What's your name?,9,Big Bang Theory,28,5
46080,Penny,15," Oh, boy, it is crazy in here tonight, huh, Glen?",9,Big Bang Theory,49,10
46082,Penny,15," Yes. Oh, bet your girlfriend is super bummed you had to work tonight. Anyway, look, we have been waiting a while, and I just",9,Big Bang Theory,125,24
46084,Penny,15, You don't have to call me ma'am.,9,Big Bang Theory,33,7
46086,Penny,15," I mean, we're basically the same age.",9,Big Bang Theory,38,7
46088,Penny,15, How old are you?,9,Big Bang Theory,17,4
46090,Penny,15," Just shut up, Glen. Come on, let's get out of here.",9,Big Bang Theory,52,11
46091,Leonard,15, What? Why?,9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
46092,Penny,15, Because I'm young. Let's go.,9,Big Bang Theory,29,5
46094,Amy,15," Rajesh, it's perfectly normal to have doubts after breaking up with someone.",9,Big Bang Theory,77,12
46095,Raj,15, You really think so?,9,Big Bang Theory,21,4
46096,Sheldon,15," Yeah, you know what's not normal? Blubbering about emotions during a flag show. Unless that emotion is excitement over New Zealand changing their flag. Yeah, good luck, you crazy Kiwis, we're rooting for you.",9,Big Bang Theory,209,34
46097,Amy,15, Your friend is hurting.,9,Big Bang Theory,24,4
46098,Raj,15," No, Sheldon's right. Emily did say I always talk about my feelings too much.",9,Big Bang Theory,77,14
46099,Sheldon,15," I suppose that could be a legitimate concern in a relationship. Uh, perhaps even a, a red flag. And speaking of red flags, check out this sexy number from the former Soviet Union. Hubba, hubba.",9,Big Bang Theory,194,35
46100,Amy,15," Oh. Uh, we-we have another caller. Hi. You're on Fun with Flags.",9,Big Bang Theory,65,12
46102,Raj,15, Kripke? Is that you?,9,Big Bang Theory,21,4
46104,Sheldon,15," Please, all comments and questions should be flag-related.",9,Big Bang Theory,59,8
46106,Sheldon,15, I don't see why not.,9,Big Bang Theory,21,5
46109,Howard,15, You're gonna have to wait one hour until you can go swimming again.,9,Big Bang Theory,68,13
46111,Howard,15, He is. Should we name him?,9,Big Bang Theory,27,6
46113,Howard,15," Nice. A classic rabbit name. Peter Rabbit, Roger Rabbit. Valentino Wolowitz Rabbit. Oh, look at all that chest hair and overbite. Of course you're a Wolowitz. Son of a bitch, he bit me.",9,Big Bang Theory,186,33
46115,Howard,15," No, I'm not okay. Wild rabbits can have rabies.",9,Big Bang Theory,48,9
46117,Howard,15," Poor judgement, obviously.",9,Big Bang Theory,27,3
46119,Howard,15, How can it be fine? I just got attacked by a clearly anti-Semitic wild animal.,9,Big Bang Theory,79,15
46121,Leonard,15," It's not what we planned, but this isn't so bad, right?",9,Big Bang Theory,56,11
46122,Penny,15, It is freaking amazing.,9,Big Bang Theory,24,4
46123,Leonard,15," Well, glad you're feeling better.",9,Big Bang Theory,34,5
46124,Penny,15," I was just hungry and cranky, and I've never been called ma'am before.",9,Big Bang Theory,71,13
46125,Leonard,15, Is that a big deal?,9,Big Bang Theory,20,5
46126,Penny,15, Kind of. When was the first time someone called you sir?,9,Big Bang Theory,57,11
46127,Leonard,15," Sixth grade, but I wore a sport coat and carried a briefcase, so",9,Big Bang Theory,65,13
46128,Penny,15," Can you believe when I met you I was 22? I mean, it's crazy. Where did all that time go?",9,Big Bang Theory,89,20
46129,Leonard,15," Mm, you watched The Bachelor a lot.",9,Big Bang Theory,36,7
46130,Penny,15," Yeah, go ahead and make jokes, but your thirties are almost over.",9,Big Bang Theory,66,12
46131,Leonard,15," No, they're not.",9,Big Bang Theory,17,3
46132,Penny,15, You're closer to 40 than you are 30.,9,Big Bang Theory,37,8
46133,Leonard,15," Ha, ha. You married an old man. Tell you what. Let's do something fun tonight.",9,Big Bang Theory,79,15
46134,Penny,15, Won't make us any younger.,9,Big Bang Theory,27,5
46135,Leonard,15," Well, maybe not, but some day we actually will be old, and we'll look back on this night and remember what a good time we had.",9,Big Bang Theory,127,26
46136,Penny,15," Okay, like what?",9,Big Bang Theory,17,3
46137,Leonard,15, I know. Food fight. I'll keep thinking.,9,Big Bang Theory,40,7
46139,Amy,15," Look, I know you both feel bad about being alone, but sometimes the best thing you can do is take a little time for yourself, especially when you just got out of a relationship.",9,Big Bang Theory,178,34
46140,Sheldon,15," Speaking of ending relationships, when British Honduras became Belize, they designed a new flag with a tree on it, and I would like to hang myself from that tree.",9,Big Bang Theory,163,29
46141,Raj,15," But, Amy, when you and Sheldon split up, didn't you start dating someone right away?",9,Big Bang Theory,85,15
46142,Amy,15," Well, I, I wouldn't say right away.",9,Big Bang Theory,36,7
46143,Sheldon,15," And actually, it was three different men.",9,Big Bang Theory,42,7
46145,Amy,15," Oh, looks like we just lost Kripke.",9,Big Bang Theory,36,7
46147,Amy,15, Now?,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
46149,Amy,15, Now?,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
46151,Amy,15," Now? Oh, looks like we just lost Kripke.",9,Big Bang Theory,41,8
46152,Raj,15," Before Emily, I was alone for so long. I just, I don't know if I can do that again.",9,Big Bang Theory,84,19
46153,Sheldon,15," Well, you know, here is something that might cheer you up. The flag of the Isle of Man is nothing but three legs sharing a weird pair of underpants, so you think you got problems.",9,Big Bang Theory,180,35
46154,Amy,15," I have an idea. Maybe someone in our audience would be interested in meeting Rajesh. Ladies, I can attest that he is a kind, handsome, intelligent",9,Big Bang Theory,147,26
46155,Raj,15," Rich parents, don't forget, rich parents.",9,Big Bang Theory,42,6
46156,Amy,15," spoiled astrophysicist who not only oh. Well, that was quick. Hi. You're on Fun with Flags.",9,Big Bang Theory,92,16
46158,Amy,15," Hello, Kripke.",9,Big Bang Theory,15,2
46161,Leonard,15," Let's see. What's young and fun? Uh, we could go dancing.",9,Big Bang Theory,58,11
46162,Leonard,15, Are you actually gonna dance?,9,Big Bang Theory,30,5
46163,Leonard,15, Of course.,9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
46164,Penny,15," Yeah. No one wants to see that. Hey, how about skinny dipping at the beach?",9,Big Bang Theory,76,15
46165,Leonard,15," No, I don't need any fish nibbling my business.",9,Big Bang Theory,48,9
46166,Penny,15," Oh, there's a screening of Moulin Rouge, I heard the crowd sings along and stuff.",9,Big Bang Theory,82,15
46167,Leonard,15, That sounds fun. When's it start?,9,Big Bang Theory,34,6
46168,Penny,15, Midnight.,9,Big Bang Theory,10,1
46169,Leonard,15, Midnight. Really? You know what? Let's do it.,9,Big Bang Theory,46,8
46170,Penny,15," Okay, great. Oh, wait. Uh, it's sold out.",9,Big Bang Theory,42,8
46171,Leonard,15," Oh, thank God.",9,Big Bang Theory,15,3
46172,Penny,15, Yes.,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
46174,Howard,15," It says, rabies in rabbits is highly unlikely.",9,Big Bang Theory,47,8
46176,Howard,15," It's not terrific. Lots of highly unlikely things happen. You saw what's under this robe, and you still married me.",9,Big Bang Theory,116,20
46178,Howard,15," Good. Thank you. Oh, okay, there is a test. All they have to do is cut off his head and check his brain.",9,Big Bang Theory,105,23
46180,Howard,15, He's not showing any symptoms. I guess I'll just go to the emergency room to be safe.,9,Big Bang Theory,86,17
46182,Howard,15," No, when I sat on the mute button and thought I'd gone deaf, that was my hypochondria.",9,Big Bang Theory,87,17
46185,Raj,15," I mean, this is the first time I've ever broken up with someone. I just, I didn't realize it was gonna hurt this much.",9,Big Bang Theory,119,24
46186,Amy,15, It really can.,9,Big Bang Theory,15,3
46187,Sheldon,15," All right. Nothing about this is fun. No one wants to talk about flags, and I haven't spoken in over ten minutes, so, enjoy your new show, Internet. Dr. Amy Farrah Flower present with.",9,Big Bang Theory,185,34
46188,Raj,15, I'm sorry for bothering you. I'll hang up now.,9,Big Bang Theory,47,9
46189,Amy,15," No, hold on, Rajesh. You know, you're not being very sympathetic. You know first hand that breakups are hard.",9,Big Bang Theory,110,19
46190,Sheldon,15," Fine. If you insist on making me a part of this, yes, I knowledge how painful they can be. However, pain has an evolutionary purpose. It provides information from the environment that, uh, behaviour isn't good for us.",9,Big Bang Theory,218,38
46192,Amy,15, I'm just gonna push all the buttons.,9,Big Bang Theory,37,7
46193,Sheldon,15," Raj, now, I'm sorry you're suffering. When Amy and I were broken up, I also suffered. And this may sound surprising, but I'm grateful for having gone through it.",9,Big Bang Theory,162,29
46194,Amy,15, Really?,9,Big Bang Theory,8,1
46195,Sheldon,15, Yes. I believe our relationship now is stronger than ever.,9,Big Bang Theory,59,10
46196,Amy,15, So do I.,9,Big Bang Theory,9,3
46197,Sheldon,15," When, when we were apart, I learned how important you are to me. And I realize that when two people are in love, sometimes they",9,Big Bang Theory,128,25
46199,Leonard,15, We are young and fun.,9,Big Bang Theory,22,5
46200,Sheldon,15, I stand corrected. Fun.,9,Big Bang Theory,24,4
46202,Sheldon,15, Congratulations on a successful live show.,9,Big Bang Theory,43,6
46203,Amy,15, And a lovely Valentine's Day.,9,Big Bang Theory,30,5
46204,Penny,15, Cleaning up is not young and fun.,9,Big Bang Theory,34,7
46205,Leonard,15, It can be. Confetti fight. Maybe you should take a break. I got this.,9,Big Bang Theory,70,14
46206,Sheldon,15, Did you know the singular of confetti is confetto?,9,Big Bang Theory,51,9
46207,Amy,15," Interesting, and when would you use the singular?",9,Big Bang Theory,50,8
46208,Sheldon,15," I'm glad you asked. Amy, you have a confetto in your nose. No, no, no, no. Other side. There you go.",9,Big Bang Theory,101,21
46210,Howard,16, Morning.,9,Big Bang Theory,9,1
46212,Howard,16, We? What is this?,9,Big Bang Theory,18,4
46214,Howard,16," Continued on milk. If you're tricking me into making my own breakfast, it didn't work for my mom, and it won't work for you. Are. We are. See spoons for more.",9,Big Bang Theory,159,31
46216,Howard,16, Are you serious?,9,Big Bang Theory,17,3
46218,Howard,16, Are you sure?,9,Big Bang Theory,14,3
46220,Howard,16," Oh, my God. This is incredible. We're gonna be parents? We're gonna get to board planes first. Finally gonna get to see what's in that family bathroom at the mall.",9,Big Bang Theory,164,30
46222,Howard,16," It is crazy. Oh. I mean, how do you prepare for something like this? I'm not even sure I've held a baby before.",9,Big Bang Theory,112,23
46224,Howard,16," But how's this all gonna work? Do we get a nanny? I mean, can we afford a nanny? And if we can, we can't get a pretty one, 'cause it'll wreck our marriage. We can't get an ugly one, 'cause it'll scare the kid.",9,Big Bang Theory,210,44
46226,Howard,16," Are we in a good school district? You're Catholic, I'm Jewish. What religion do we raise it? And if it's a boy, do we get him circumcised? People say it's barbaric, but if we don't, it looks like a pig in a blanket.",9,Big Bang Theory,216,43
46228,Howard,16," How's it gonna be okay? Look at me, I'm a mess. And that means this baby's gonna be half a mess. And that's even before we screw it up with our cut-rate moderately attractive nanny.",9,Big Bang Theory,182,35
46230,Leonard,16," Hey, Raj, I read a couple of guys in your department may have discovered a new planet in our solar system?",9,Big Bang Theory,107,21
46231,Sheldon,16," Oh, I heard about that. Why didn't you discover it?",9,Big Bang Theory,52,10
46232,Raj,16," Because instead of being in the telescope room, I was busy making you guys home made jam for the holidays.",9,Big Bang Theory,107,20
46233,Sheldon,16," Well, you be sure to let us know when you win the Nobel Prize for boysenberry.",9,Big Bang Theory,79,16
46234,Leonard,16, Hey.,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
46235,Sheldon,16, Hello.,9,Big Bang Theory,7,1
46236,Raj,16," Hey, bud.",9,Big Bang Theory,10,2
46237,Leonard,16, Ready to play when you are.,9,Big Bang Theory,28,6
46238,Howard,16," Yeah, um, in a minute. I actually need to tell you guys something.",9,Big Bang Theory,67,13
46239,Raj,16," If it's thank you for the home made jam you got in December, congratulations, you're the first one.",9,Big Bang Theory,100,18
46240,Leonard,16, What's going on?,9,Big Bang Theory,17,3
46241,Howard,16," I'm, uh, uh, gonna be a father.",9,Big Bang Theory,32,7
46242,Leonard,16, What? Congratulations.,9,Big Bang Theory,23,2
46243,Raj,16, That's so amazing.,9,Big Bang Theory,19,3
46244,Sheldon,16," Oh, no.",9,Big Bang Theory,8,2
46245,Leonard,16," Why oh, no?",9,Big Bang Theory,12,3
46246,Sheldon,16," Because this changes everything. What about comic book night? Uh, what about playing games together? What about our trips to Disneyland? How can we do those things with a child around?",9,Big Bang Theory,185,31
46247,Leonard,16," Relax, there's room for two babies in this group.",9,Big Bang Theory,50,9
46248,Sheldon,16," Oh, dear lord, Penny's pregnant, too?",9,Big Bang Theory,38,6
46249,Leonard,16, You're the other baby.,9,Big Bang Theory,23,4
46250,Sheldon,16," Oh, really? Okay, well, would a baby have to shave once every 11 days?",9,Big Bang Theory,71,14
46251,Leonard,16, Would an adult refuse to eat his graham crackers because one of them was broken?,9,Big Bang Theory,81,15
46252,Sheldon,16, I guess we'll call this a draw.,9,Big Bang Theory,32,7
46255,Penny,16, Leonard says you're pregnant.,9,Big Bang Theory,30,4
46256,Amy,16, What?,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
46257,Penny,16," Don't say anything. act surprised when she tells you. All right, how you want to do this?",9,Big Bang Theory,90,17
46259,Penny,16," Oh, my God, I can't believe it.",9,Big Bang Theory,32,7
46260,Amy,16, This is so exciting.,9,Big Bang Theory,21,4
46262,Penny,16," Are, are you not happy about this?",9,Big Bang Theory,35,7
46264,Penny,16," No, no, come on. Come on, you're not gonna get fat. You're gonna be beautiful and glowing and, and have the cutest little baby bump ever.",9,Big Bang Theory,138,26
46266,Penny,16," Oh, that's all right. All I heard was skinny.",9,Big Bang Theory,46,9
46267,Amy,16, I wouldn't make too much out of Howard not reacting the way you expected him to.,9,Big Bang Theory,81,16
46268,Penny,16," Yeah, I'm sure it was just the initial shock of it all.",9,Big Bang Theory,56,12
46271,Howard,16, I shouldn't be raising a kid. I don't even eat my own vegetables.,9,Big Bang Theory,66,13
46272,Leonard,16," Buddy, I, I think you might be overreacting.",9,Big Bang Theory,45,8
46273,Howard,16," And then there's this nose. I mean, what if he looks like me? Or worse, what if she looks like me?",9,Big Bang Theory,99,21
46274,Sheldon,16, Not to mention the impact on our social circle. Everything's going to change. Howard won't be able to come over as much.,9,Big Bang Theory,121,22
46275,Raj,16," Well, he could bring the baby here.",9,Big Bang Theory,36,7
46276,Sheldon,16," Oh, but then we'd have to baby-proof the apartment. You know, my sister has one of those toilet locks in her bathroom. I have two doctorates, I still had to go in the sink.",9,Big Bang Theory,173,34
46277,Howard,16," Oh, my God, and do you have any idea how expensive having a kid is?",9,Big Bang Theory,68,15
46278,Raj,16," I read that in Los Angeles, raising a child through college can cost over a million dollars.",9,Big Bang Theory,93,17
46279,Howard,16," A million dollars? God, it's like my nuts just kicked me in the nuts. That's it, I got to start earning more money right now.",9,Big Bang Theory,126,25
46280,Raj,16," I know, you could ask Bernadette for a raise in your allowance.",9,Big Bang Theory,64,12
46281,Howard,16, This isn't a joke.,9,Big Bang Theory,19,4
46282,Raj,16, I wasn't joking.,9,Big Bang Theory,17,3
46283,Leonard,16, It'll be fine. People have kids every day. You'll figure this out.,9,Big Bang Theory,67,12
46284,Raj,16," Yeah, come on, this is great news and you know it.",9,Big Bang Theory,51,11
46285,Howard,16," You're right, it is, I'm just a little overwhelmed right now.",9,Big Bang Theory,62,11
46286,Leonard,16," Hey, you know what we should do?",9,Big Bang Theory,33,7
46287,Sheldon,16, All get vasectomies so this doesn't happen to us?,9,Big Bang Theory,50,9
46288,Leonard,16, Go out and celebrate. But not your worst idea.,9,Big Bang Theory,47,9
46290,Amy,16," Hey, let's go do something to get your mind off this.",9,Big Bang Theory,54,11
46291,Penny,16," Yeah, yeah, we should go out.",9,Big Bang Theory,30,6
46293,Penny,16," Uh, I don't know, a bar?",9,Big Bang Theory,25,6
46295,Penny,16," We can, but all right.",9,Big Bang Theory,23,5
46296,Amy,16, Are you hungry? How about that sushi place you love?,9,Big Bang Theory,53,10
46298,Penny,16," Okay, look, we don't have to go anywhere. We can just, you know, stay here and hang out in the hot tub.",9,Big Bang Theory,104,22
46300,Amy,16," Maybe you should get a new doctor. What, he said you can't laugh either?",9,Big Bang Theory,73,14
46302,Raj,16," I'd like to propose a toast to our friend, Howard, his, um, his big heart, his beautiful soul",9,Big Bang Theory,94,18
46303,Leonard,16, And his tight little pants that somehow did not make him sterile.,9,Big Bang Theory,66,12
46305,Howard,16," Well, look at this. I bet whoever invented tiny umbrellas doesn't have to worry about money. He can have all the kids he wants.",9,Big Bang Theory,128,24
46306,Sheldon,16, And can keep a small portion of their heads dry.,9,Big Bang Theory,49,10
46307,Howard,16," If I'm gonna have any chance of raising this kid, I need to come up with a big idea to make some money.",9,Big Bang Theory,104,23
46308,Leonard,16, There's no reason you can't.,9,Big Bang Theory,29,5
46309,Howard,16, That's easy for you to say. You and Sheldon already came up with your superfluid helium model.,9,Big Bang Theory,95,17
46310,Leonard,16, That's just research. We're never gonna make any money from it.,9,Big Bang Theory,64,11
46311,Sheldon,16, Forget helium. The real superfluid is the fruit punch in this mug. Reminds me of my daddy's secret don't tell mama juice.,9,Big Bang Theory,122,22
46312,Leonard,16," Uh, these are strong, you should slow down.",9,Big Bang Theory,44,8
46313,Sheldon,16, Oh. I'll just take one last sip. Ah.,9,Big Bang Theory,37,8
46315,Howard,16," Okay, how about this for an invention, slightly bigger cocktail umbrellas.",9,Big Bang Theory,75,11
46316,Leonard,16, How is that a new invention?,9,Big Bang Theory,29,6
46317,Howard,16," I don't know, all Apple does is change the size of things and we keep buying them.",9,Big Bang Theory,83,17
46318,Raj,16, It's true. I like my giant iPad and my little iPad almost as much as my regular-sized iPad.,9,Big Bang Theory,92,18
46319,Sheldon,16, This place is terrific. Why. why have we never been here before?,9,Big Bang Theory,65,12
46320,Leonard,16, The same reason we don't do a lot of fun stuff. You.,9,Big Bang Theory,53,12
46321,Sheldon,16, That's some smart talk from a guy who can't even keep his face in focus. Where's the bathroom?,9,Big Bang Theory,95,18
46322,Raj,16," Uh, it's in the corner.",9,Big Bang Theory,24,5
46323,Sheldon,16," Excuse me. Hey, how you doin'?",9,Big Bang Theory,31,6
46324,Raj,16, I hope the bathroom is clearly marked.,9,Big Bang Theory,39,7
46325,Leonard,16, Doesn't matter. He's headed for the kitchen anyway.,9,Big Bang Theory,52,8
46326,Howard,16," Maybe that's an idea, guidance systems for drunk people.",9,Big Bang Theory,57,9
46327,Raj,16, They have that. It's called Uber.,9,Big Bang Theory,34,6
46328,Howard,16," Hey. In your supercooled helium experiments, did you create quantum vortices?",9,Big Bang Theory,78,11
46329,Leonard,16, Yeah. Why?,9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
46330,Howard,16," Well, if you made a guidance system, couldn't you use those vortices as a gyroscope?",9,Big Bang Theory,85,15
46331,Leonard,16, Wow. I've never thought about that.,9,Big Bang Theory,36,6
46332,Howard,16," And since it's in a quantum state, it would maintain an infinite persistence.",9,Big Bang Theory,78,13
46333,Raj,16," Groundbreaking revelations, tropical drinks. Tell me this isn't like the best episode of Sex and the City.",9,Big Bang Theory,107,17
46334,Leonard,16, You may have actually just come up with something.,9,Big Bang Theory,51,9
46335,Howard,16, You think so?,9,Big Bang Theory,14,3
46336,Leonard,16, I really do.,9,Big Bang Theory,13,3
46337,Sheldon,16," You guys, the bathroom here is amazing. There's people cooking in it.",9,Big Bang Theory,70,12
46339,Amy,16, Think about all the fun things you get to do when you have a baby.,9,Big Bang Theory,67,15
46340,Penny,16," Yeah, yeah, you get to buy toys and little clothes.",9,Big Bang Theory,52,10
46342,Penny,16," And whenever you're hungry, you'll be in a minivan with Cheerios all over the floor.",9,Big Bang Theory,85,15
46343,Amy,16," Oh, and I just found a new travel cup for Sheldon. It only lets out three at a time. So, when did you guys decide to get pregnant?",9,Big Bang Theory,131,28
46345,Penny,16," Oh, tell us.",9,Big Bang Theory,13,3
46346,Amy,16," Yeah, tell us.",9,Big Bang Theory,15,3
46348,Penny,16," Oh, come on, we're all grown-ups. We've all done it.",9,Big Bang Theory,53,10
46349,Amy,16," Me, me, me too. I'm a grown-up and I've done it.",9,Big Bang Theory,49,11
46351,Amy,16," Oh, that sounds juicy.",9,Big Bang Theory,23,4
46353,Penny,16," Wait, I remember that. Hang on. You did it at our place?",9,Big Bang Theory,57,12
46355,Amy,16, What?,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
46356,Penny,16, No.,9,Big Bang Theory,4,1
46358,Amy,16, How could you do that?,9,Big Bang Theory,23,5
46360,Amy,16, I do know what that's like. I really do.,9,Big Bang Theory,41,9
46362,Leonard,16, I'm not seeing anyone using liquid helium vortices like this.,9,Big Bang Theory,62,10
46363,Howard,16, I'm not finding anything either.,9,Big Bang Theory,33,5
46364,Raj,16, It's a good sign.,9,Big Bang Theory,18,4
46365,Sheldon,16," Oh, wait, I found something.",9,Big Bang Theory,29,5
46366,Howard,16, Damn. What is it?,9,Big Bang Theory,18,4
46367,Sheldon,16," This video. The baby panda sneezes, and the mama panda gets so scared.",9,Big Bang Theory,71,13
46368,Leonard,16, Can you focus on what we're talking about?,9,Big Bang Theory,43,8
46369,Sheldon,16," All right. Look, now, this may be the rum talking, but as long as the unpinning rate of the vortices is kept within 1.1 and 1.3, the Magnus force issue should be negligible.",9,Big Bang Theory,174,33
46370,Raj,16," Even drunk, he's still smarter than all of us.",9,Big Bang Theory,47,9
46371,Sheldon,16, And stronger. Who wants to see me beat up the bartender?,9,Big Bang Theory,57,11
46372,Leonard,16, I'd enjoy that.,9,Big Bang Theory,16,3
46373,Sheldon,16," Nah, she's a good kid.",9,Big Bang Theory,23,5
46374,Howard,16," If this is a viable thing, we could get a patent and license it to companies that make guidance systems.",9,Big Bang Theory,105,20
46375,Raj,16, Look at that. You've known you're gonna be a father for less than a day and you're already stepping up.,9,Big Bang Theory,104,20
46376,Leonard,16," I'm telling you, you got this.",9,Big Bang Theory,31,6
46377,Howard,16, Maybe you're right.,9,Big Bang Theory,20,3
46378,Sheldon,16, Of course he's right. You and I both know how hard it is growing up without a father. That's why I'm confident you're gonna be the best dad you can be.,9,Big Bang Theory,152,31
46379,Howard,16," Thank you, Sheldon.",9,Big Bang Theory,20,3
46380,Sheldon,16," You're welcome. And if he has twins, we can do all kinds of neat experiments on them.",9,Big Bang Theory,86,17
46383,Penny,16," No, we're a team. If you can't go in, we're not going in.",9,Big Bang Theory,58,13
46384,Amy,16, Then why are we drinking?,9,Big Bang Theory,26,5
46385,Penny,16," Okay, it's not like she's got the Christ child in there, all right?  Oh. It's Leonard. He says Sheldon's drunk and they're gonna do karaoke if we want to join them.",9,Big Bang Theory,165,31
46387,Amy,16," Oh, no. Sheldon's drunk texting me.",9,Big Bang Theory,36,6
46388,Penny,16, What's it say?,9,Big Bang Theory,15,3
46389,Amy,16, Would you like to sing karaoke with us.,9,Big Bang Theory,40,8
46391,Amy,16, He used a period instead of a question mark. He's so wasted.,9,Big Bang Theory,61,12
46393,Raj,16," Your movie's showing, so you're going. Could care less about the five you're blowing. Theatre gets dark just to start the show. You spot a fine woman sitting in your row, she's dressed in yellow, she says hello, come sit next to me, you fine fellow. You run over there without a second to lose, and what comes next, hey, bust a move.",9,Big Bang Theory,334,63
46394,Leonard,16," You want it, you got it, oh, you want it, baby you got it",9,Big Bang Theory,58,14
46395,Raj,16," Just bust a move,",9,Big Bang Theory,18,4
46396,Leonard,16," You want it, you got it, oh, you want it, baby you got it",9,Big Bang Theory,58,14
46397,Raj,16," Just bust a move,",9,Big Bang Theory,18,4
46398,Leonard,16," You want it, you got it, oh, you want it, baby you got it",9,Big Bang Theory,58,14
46399,Penny,16," Hey, guys. Congratulations.",9,Big Bang Theory,28,3
46400,Howard,16, Thank you.,9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
46401,Amy,16, Hi. How are you doing?,9,Big Bang Theory,23,5
46402,Sheldon,16," Wonderful. I'm being musically encouraged to bust a move. If I knew what that meant, I might just do it.",9,Big Bang Theory,105,20
46403,Howard,16, I'm really glad you're here. Can we talk?,9,Big Bang Theory,42,8
46405,Penny,16," So, you gonna get up there later?",9,Big Bang Theory,34,7
46406,Sheldon,16," A microphone, a room full of inaccurate depictions of Polynesian religion, and a captive audience to hear about it? You bet I am.",9,Big Bang Theory,130,23
46407,Howard,16, I'm sorry I freaked out this morning. I want you to know I'm done being scared.,9,Big Bang Theory,80,16
46409,Howard,16," Thank God, 'cause I was lying, you might not have to wait nine months to see someone soil their pants. But I'm also really excited. I mean it.",9,Big Bang Theory,143,28
46411,Howard,16, I love you. Mmm. And I'm not just saying that because your breasts are gonna get bigger.,9,Big Bang Theory,89,17
46413,Penny,16," Are we an item? Girl, quit playin'.",9,Big Bang Theory,36,7
46414,Amy,16," We're just friends, what are you sayin'?",9,Big Bang Theory,41,7
46415,Penny,16, Say there's another and look right in my eyes.,9,Big Bang Theory,47,9
46416,Amy,16, My first love broke my heart for the first time.,9,Big Bang Theory,49,10
46419,Howard,16," Baby, I need your lovin', got to have all your lovin'. Baby, I need your lovin', got to have all your lovin'.",9,Big Bang Theory,110,22
46421,Raj,16," Ooh, baby, baby, baby, baby. Ooh, baby, baby, baby, baby.",9,Big Bang Theory,58,10
46422,Leonard,16," Ah, push it.",9,Big Bang Theory,13,3
46424,Leonard,16, Push it real good.,9,Big Bang Theory,19,4
46426,Sheldon,16," Land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrims' pride, from every mountainside let freedom ring.",9,Big Bang Theory,99,16
46428,Howard,16," I'd like to dedicate my last song of the evening to my wife, best friend, and now the mother of our child. I love you, Bernie.  Havin' my baby, what a lovely way of sayin' how much you love me. Havin' my baby, what a lovely way of sayin' what you're thinkin' of me.",9,Big Bang Theory,266,54
46429,Sheldon,16, You're kidding. What kind of maniacs have coitus in someone else's bedroom?,9,Big Bang Theory,76,12
46430,Howard,16," Thank you, Pasadena. Good night.",9,Big Bang Theory,33,5
46432,Penny,16, That was such a fun night.,9,Big Bang Theory,27,6
46433,Leonard,16, Probably 'cause you got to see your man up there rockin' the mic.,9,Big Bang Theory,66,13
46434,Penny,16," Yeah, yeah. I was a little surprised when you decided to beat-box.",9,Big Bang Theory,67,12
46435,Leonard,16, Oh. That was really an asthma attack. I just sold it.,9,Big Bang Theory,54,11
46436,Penny,16," Well, I am so happy for Howard and Bernadette.",9,Big Bang Theory,47,9
46437,Leonard,16," Me, too. So, you ever think about it?",9,Big Bang Theory,38,8
46438,Penny,16," Babies? Well, I'm not in a rush but someday, yeah, sure. What about you?",9,Big Bang Theory,73,14
46439,Leonard,16, I think we'd make amazing parents.,9,Big Bang Theory,35,6
46440,Sheldon,16, Will you guys keep it down?,9,Big Bang Theory,28,6
46441,Penny,16," On the other hand, we might lack a certain maturity.",9,Big Bang Theory,53,10
46443,Amy,17," So Sheldon, there's something I've been wanting to talk about but I know it's kind of a touchy subject.",9,Big Bang Theory,104,19
46444,Leonard,17, Way to narrow it down to everything.,9,Big Bang Theory,37,7
46445,Sheldon,17, What is it?,9,Big Bang Theory,12,3
46446,Amy,17," Well, your birthday's coming up, and you've never let us celebrate it, and I was hoping maybe this year we could.",9,Big Bang Theory,114,21
46447,Sheldon,17," Oh, I suppose that's a discussion we could have.",9,Big Bang Theory,49,9
46448,Amy,17," Okay, great, I mean, it doesn't have to be a big party or anything. I was just, where'd he go?",9,Big Bang Theory,95,20
46449,Penny,17," W, wait a minute. You mention his birthday and he vanishes?",9,Big Bang Theory,60,11
46450,Leonard,17," Well, where's that information been this whole time?",9,Big Bang Theory,53,8
46452,Penny,17," Well, where is he?",9,Big Bang Theory,19,4
46453,Amy,17, Sheldon?,9,Big Bang Theory,9,1
46454,Leonard,17, I'll check his room.,9,Big Bang Theory,21,4
46455,Sheldon,17, Surprise.,9,Big Bang Theory,10,1
46456,Penny,17," Oh, my God.",9,Big Bang Theory,12,3
46457,Sheldon,17," Just one example of how birthdays can be terrible. Now, can we please drop this subject and pick a new one? I suggest how thick can a soup get before it becomes a stew? You know, the answer, it may surprise you.",9,Big Bang Theory,212,42
46458,Amy,17, I'm sorry I brought it up.,9,Big Bang Theory,27,6
46459,Penny,17," Yeah, what is the problem? Is it about getting older?",9,Big Bang Theory,54,10
46460,Sheldon,17," Please, look at this porcelain skin. I'm like a human sink.",9,Big Bang Theory,60,11
46461,Amy,17, But it's the one day a year that's just all about you.,9,Big Bang Theory,55,12
46462,Leonard,17, One day. Right.,9,Big Bang Theory,16,3
46463,Amy,17, Can you please just tell me why?,9,Big Bang Theory,33,7
46464,Sheldon,17," Fine. As you know, I have a twin sister with whom I obviously share a birthday. Every year we'd have a party. No one I invited would ever come, because they didn't like me.",9,Big Bang Theory,173,34
46465,Amy,17, I'm sorry.,9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
46466,Sheldon,17," Oh, that part wasn't so bad. I didn't like them, either. But then I'd inevitably spend the whole day being tortured by my sister's friends.",9,Big Bang Theory,140,25
46467,Penny,17," Oh, poor thing.",9,Big Bang Theory,16,3
46468,Sheldon,17," When I was six, they told me Batman was coming to my party. I waited by the door for hours. Closest thing to Batman I saw was when a robin flew into the window.",9,Big Bang Theory,161,34
46469,Amy,17, You realize none of those things would happen now?,9,Big Bang Theory,51,9
46470,Sheldon,17," I do, but why do you care if I celebrate my birthday at all?",9,Big Bang Theory,61,14
46471,Amy,17," Well, you made my last birthday so memorable, I wanted to return the favour.",9,Big Bang Theory,77,14
46472,Penny,17," You know, if you had a party now, you have plenty of friends that would love to come.",9,Big Bang Theory,86,18
46473,Leonard,17," And we live here, so we have no choice.",9,Big Bang Theory,40,9
46474,Penny,17, Yeah.,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
46475,Sheldon,17," Very well. You may celebrate my life by throwing a party with cake, presents and a shower of admiration and love. But then you owe me big-time.",9,Big Bang Theory,144,27
46477,Howard,17, You have any idea what you're getting Sheldon for his birthday?,9,Big Bang Theory,64,11
46478,Raj,17, He's been fascinated with dinosaurs lately. Maybe we could get him a fossil.,9,Big Bang Theory,77,13
46479,Leonard,17," Well, just don't get anything Jurassic. He feels like that whole chunk of time has gone Hollywood. Hey, uh, you know, he told a sad story about how his sister tricked him into thinking Batman was coming to his party.",9,Big Bang Theory,217,40
46480,Howard,17, That's funny. Let's do that.,9,Big Bang Theory,29,5
46481,Leonard,17, Maybe we could get Batman to actually show up.,9,Big Bang Theory,47,9
46482,Raj,17," You mean, some guy in a lame suit?",9,Big Bang Theory,35,8
46483,Leonard,17," Or a real Batman. Hey, Stuart? Didn't you try to get Adam West to do a signing here once?",9,Big Bang Theory,90,19
46485,Leonard,17, Can I get his contact info?,9,Big Bang Theory,28,6
46487,Leonard,17, He is?,9,Big Bang Theory,7,2
46490,Amy,17," Okay, so how do you feel about party balloons?",9,Big Bang Theory,47,9
46491,Sheldon,17," Uh, Mylar balloons, yes. Latex balloons, no. Water balloons, I will jump off the roof and aim for your car.",9,Big Bang Theory,108,20
46492,Penny,17," All right, what about music?",9,Big Bang Theory,29,5
46493,Sheldon,17, I enjoy marching bands and Tibetan throat singing.,9,Big Bang Theory,51,8
46494,Penny,17, No music it is.,9,Big Bang Theory,16,4
46496,Sheldon,17," Well, my favourite is chocolate with strawberry frosting, three layers, and if there's writing on it, make sure it's not all caps. I don't need my dessert yelling at me.",9,Big Bang Theory,170,30
46498,Raj,17," Hey, so what was Adam West like on the phone?",9,Big Bang Theory,46,10
46499,Leonard,17," Uh, nice guy. But it was a little weird to hear Batman say don't ring the doorbell or my poodles will go crazy.",9,Big Bang Theory,112,23
46500,Raj,17," You know, Adam West is my favourite Batman? Well, after Michael Keaton, Christian Bale and Batman from The Lego Movie.",9,Big Bang Theory,119,20
46501,Howard,17, Don't say that to him.,9,Big Bang Theory,23,5
46502,Raj,17," What? He beat out George Clooney, and that's something. Like, I love me some Clooney.",9,Big Bang Theory,86,15
46503,Leonard,17, Don't say that to anyone.,9,Big Bang Theory,26,5
46505,Penny,17," Thank you so much for helping us, Stuart.",9,Big Bang Theory,42,8
46507,Penny,17," Okay, sweetie, we're on the clock here. Can you hate yourself and frost at the same time?",9,Big Bang Theory,90,17
46515,Penny,17," Yeah, birthday party first. Pity party later.",9,Big Bang Theory,46,7
46517,Leonard,17, Are you crazy? How can you put Michael Keaton in front of Christian Bale?,9,Big Bang Theory,74,14
46519,Raj,17, Thank you. That's why I say Keaton's number one. He brought a sense of humour to the role.,9,Big Bang Theory,91,18
46521,Howard,17," Really? You're ahead of Bale? The man who personified the words, I'm Batman.",9,Big Bang Theory,77,13
46523,Leonard,17," I'm sold, you're ahead of Bale.",9,Big Bang Theory,32,6
46525,Howard,17, Can we just all agree we're worried about Affleck?,9,Big Bang Theory,51,9
46526,Leonard,17, Sure.,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
46527,Raj,17," Yeah, of course.",9,Big Bang Theory,17,3
46530,Sheldon,17, Is there a reason I had to leave my own apartment?,9,Big Bang Theory,51,11
46531,Amy,17," Well, I think they just want you to see it for the first time all decorated.",9,Big Bang Theory,77,16
46532,Sheldon,17, But who's gonna tell them they're doing it wrong?,9,Big Bang Theory,50,9
46533,Amy,17," Well, I'm, I'm sure they'll ask you to give a speech, and that's when you just tear 'em a new one. Have to say, you, you do look good in that suit.",9,Big Bang Theory,148,32
46534,Sheldon,17, Oh. Thank you.,9,Big Bang Theory,15,3
46535,Amy,17," Maybe later I'll, uh, get to see you in your birthday suit.",9,Big Bang Theory,60,12
46536,Sheldon,17, But this is my birthday suit. Are you having a stroke? Because that's the kind of thing that just ruins a birthday party.,9,Big Bang Theory,122,23
46538,Leonard,17," So, Mother, I'm surprised you came all this way for Sheldon's birthday.",9,Big Bang Theory,72,12
46540,Leonard,17, Oh. You had a party for your 60th?,9,Big Bang Theory,35,8
46542,Penny,17," You know, to be fair, we did get married in Vegas and didn't invite her.",9,Big Bang Theory,73,15
46545,Amy,17, Oh. Penny says everyone's there. Are you ready?,9,Big Bang Theory,48,8
46546,Sheldon,17, I am. Oh. Wait.,9,Big Bang Theory,16,4
46547,Amy,17, Are you all right?,9,Big Bang Theory,19,4
46548,Sheldon,17," No, I just, I got a little light-headed.",9,Big Bang Theory,41,8
46549,Amy,17," Oh, do you need a minute?",9,Big Bang Theory,26,6
46550,Sheldon,17," No. No, if I can walk past that pet shop with the parrot in the window, I suppose I can do this.",9,Big Bang Theory,97,22
46552,Leonard,17, Speech! Speech!,9,Big Bang Theory,16,2
46553,Raj,17," Come on, Sheldon, say something.",9,Big Bang Theory,33,5
46554,Sheldon,17," Uh, um, uh, thank you all so much for coming. Beverly. Wil Wheaton. Adam West, for some reason.",9,Big Bang Theory,96,18
46555,Leonard,17, Batman finally came to your party.,9,Big Bang Theory,35,6
46557,Sheldon,17, Thank you. This is all so thoughtful. Excuse me.,9,Big Bang Theory,49,9
46560,Leonard,17," Okay, I'd better go in there and talk to him.",9,Big Bang Theory,46,10
46561,Amy,17," Well, don't you think I'm the one who should go in?",9,Big Bang Theory,52,11
46562,Leonard,17," No offence, but I've known the guy a really long time.",9,Big Bang Theory,55,11
46563,Amy,17," Well, I've, you know, seen him without pants on.",9,Big Bang Theory,49,9
46564,Leonard,17," Again, no offence, but so have I.",9,Big Bang Theory,34,7
46565,Amy,17," Well, he's seen me without pants on.",9,Big Bang Theory,37,7
46566,Leonard,17," Again, no",9,Big Bang Theory,10,2
46567,Penny,17," Okay, this is ridiculous.  Sheldon? Can I come in?",9,Big Bang Theory,51,9
46568,Sheldon,17, How do you know I'm not using the facilities?,9,Big Bang Theory,46,9
46569,Penny,17," Because you e-mail me your bathroom schedule once a week, even though I've clicked unsubscribe, like, a thousand times. So, what's going on?",9,Big Bang Theory,141,23
46570,Sheldon,17," I don't know. I looked around the room, and I saw all the faces and the presents, and it, it was just too much.",9,Big Bang Theory,112,24
46571,Penny,17," I get that. Hey, you want to just bring a few people in here? You know, Wil Wheaton in the bathtub, Batman on the toilet. It'll be like the weirdest Comic-Con ever.",9,Big Bang Theory,165,32
46572,Sheldon,17, I know that you worked hard to put this together. I'm sorry I'm ruining it.,9,Big Bang Theory,76,15
46573,Penny,17," Oh, pl, you're not ruining it. Look, at some point, Raj will try to get everyone to do the Electric Slide. Now, that will ruin it.",9,Big Bang Theory,131,26
46574,Sheldon,17, I don't think I can go back out there.,9,Big Bang Theory,39,9
46575,Penny,17," That's fine. You know, I hate that your sister and her friends used to torture you. But what I hate even more is, if I was there, I would have tortured you, too.",9,Big Bang Theory,162,33
46576,Sheldon,17," Based on this pep talk, I'd say you're still doing it.",9,Big Bang Theory,55,11
46577,Penny,17," My point is, there was a time I never would've been friends with someone like you, and now you are one of my favourite people. So, if what you need is to spend your birthday in a bathroom, I'm happy to do it with you.",9,Big Bang Theory,218,45
46578,Sheldon,17," Well, everyone will think I'm weird.",9,Big Bang Theory,37,6
46579,Penny,17," Sweetie, you are weird. Everyone knows you're weird, but they're all still here because they care about you so much.",9,Big Bang Theory,117,20
46583,Leonard,17, Hey.,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
46585,Leonard,17, Leslie. I can't remember the last time we talked. So much has changed.,9,Big Bang Theory,71,13
46587,Leonard,17," Yeah, uh, um, Penny and I got married.",9,Big Bang Theory,39,8
46589,Leonard,17," Yeah, well, don't be a stranger.",9,Big Bang Theory,33,6
46590,Penny,17," Okay, everybody, Sheldon is gonna come back out, but I think he's a little embarrassed, so let's all be extra nice, okay?",9,Big Bang Theory,122,22
46592,Sheldon,17," Hello, everyone. I, I'd like to apologize for my behaviour. I hope it hasn't put a damper on the party. So, please, enjoy yourselves. Oh, this is quickly getting out of hand.",9,Big Bang Theory,175,32
46593,Amy,17," If I may, I, I'd like to propose a toast. Um, thank you all for coming tonight. I know it's customary for the birthday boy to receive presents, but I feel like I got the greatest gift the day he was born.",9,Big Bang Theory,205,42
46594,Sheldon,17," Aw, Amy, that was lovely. You know, this is fun. Let's do more. Someone else say something wonderful about me.",9,Big Bang Theory,111,20
46595,Howard,17," Sheldon, I don't think everyone",9,Big Bang Theory,32,5
46596,Sheldon,17," Wolowitz, perfect. Everyone listen to Wolowitz.",9,Big Bang Theory,48,6
46597,Howard,17," Okay, then, uh, Sheldon, we've known each other a long time. And it is a pleasure to work with you and call you my friend.",9,Big Bang Theory,123,25
46598,Sheldon,17," Little generic. Keep thinking. We'll circle back. Wil Wheaton, go.",9,Big Bang Theory,67,10
46600,Sheldon,17," That's how you do it, Wolowitz. Now you see why he's famous and you're not.",9,Big Bang Theory,76,15
46604,Leonard,17," Seriously, Barry, stop.",9,Big Bang Theory,24,3
46605,Raj,17," And it was Gandhi who said, live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.",9,Big Bang Theory,103,22
46606,Sheldon,17, And it was Sheldon Cooper who said let's speed this up. A lot of people want to talk.,9,Big Bang Theory,86,18
46608,Sheldon,17," Oh. Oh, now, you know I hate change. Say it.",9,Big Bang Theory,45,10
46612,Sheldon,17," Thank you, Bernadette. That was perfect.",9,Big Bang Theory,41,6
46613,Howard,17, What? You gotta be kidding me?,9,Big Bang Theory,31,6
46614,Leonard,17," Sheldon, we've been together so long, it's hard to remember a time you weren't in my life. And believe me, I try. You make me laugh. You make me a better scientist. You make me crazy. You're more than just my roommate, you're my brother.",9,Big Bang Theory,238,45
46615,Sheldon,17, Thank you.,9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
46616,Leonard,17," Happy birthday, buddy.",9,Big Bang Theory,23,3
46617,Sheldon,17," Thank you. That, that was wonderful.",9,Big Bang Theory,37,6
46618,Penny,17," Oh, wait, wait, wait. Stuart didn't get to speak.",9,Big Bang Theory,50,9
46620,Amy,17," Hey, everybody, listen up.",9,Big Bang Theory,27,4
46621,Penny,17, You nailed it.,9,Big Bang Theory,15,3
46622,Amy,17, We've got someone who couldn't be here but really wanted to wish you a happy birthday.,9,Big Bang Theory,87,16
46624,Sheldon,17, Professor Hawking.,9,Big Bang Theory,19,2
46626,Sheldon,17, Thank you so much. I can't believe you're,9,Big Bang Theory,42,8
46628,Sheldon,17," Oh, you're singing. Well, I'm sorry.",9,Big Bang Theory,37,6
46630,Leonard,17," Uh, Professor Hawking, if you just give us one second, we'll light the candles, and we can all sing together.",9,Big Bang Theory,110,20
46632,Penny,17," Okay, while they get the cake, Sheldon, I just want to say, I hope you didn't think you were gonna get through tonight without a hug.",9,Big Bang Theory,134,26
46633,Sheldon,17," You know, I used to hate these hugs. Now they're just extremely irritating.",9,Big Bang Theory,76,13
46634,Leonard,17," Ready when you are, Professor Hawking.",9,Big Bang Theory,39,6
46639,Howard,18," Okay, I gotta ask, why are you wearing a bow tie?",9,Big Bang Theory,50,11
46640,Sheldon,18, I've never applied for a patent before. I wanted to make a good impression.,9,Big Bang Theory,76,14
46641,Howard,18, Is the impression that your first name is Pee-Wee?,9,Big Bang Theory,51,9
46642,Sheldon,18," Yeah, well, you're an engineer. End of joke, burn.",9,Big Bang Theory,51,9
46644,Howard,18," See, he's not wearing a tie.",9,Big Bang Theory,29,6
46645,Leonard,18," Well, he's a patent attorney. Maybe his tie is pending.",9,Big Bang Theory,56,10
46647,Sheldon,18, That's great.,9,Big Bang Theory,14,2
46648,Howard,18, Excellent.,9,Big Bang Theory,11,1
46649,Leonard,18, So what happens next?,9,Big Bang Theory,22,4
46651,Howard,18," Oh, I don't think there will be.",9,Big Bang Theory,33,7
46652,Leonard,18," Yeah, we did our own search.",9,Big Bang Theory,29,6
46654,Sheldon,18, Get a load of this guy.,9,Big Bang Theory,24,6
46655,Howard,18, Can you imagine if we make money with this?,9,Big Bang Theory,44,9
46656,Leonard,18," If we do, I am splurging on the best sinus irrigator money can buy.",9,Big Bang Theory,68,14
46657,Howard,18," That old sad story, guy gets a little money, goes straight up his nose.",9,Big Bang Theory,72,14
46659,Howard,18, Seventy-five percent?,9,Big Bang Theory,22,2
46660,Sheldon,18, That's outrageous. This is our idea based on our research. How can you possibly justify owning a majority share?,9,Big Bang Theory,113,19
46662,Sheldon,18, I know when I'm beat.,9,Big Bang Theory,22,5
46663,Leonard,18," Hold on, hold on. So the three of us do all the work and only end up with 25%?",9,Big Bang Theory,79,19
46665,Leonard,18," Well, until you just said that mean thing, kinda.",9,Big Bang Theory,50,9
46667,Howard,18," Wait, so this can turn out to be a financial success, and I get nothing?",9,Big Bang Theory,73,15
46669,Sheldon,18," Well, that's not fair. We should all get plaques.",9,Big Bang Theory,50,9
46670,Leonard,18," Sorry, but we can't sign this.",9,Big Bang Theory,31,6
46671,Howard,18," Come on, let's go.",9,Big Bang Theory,19,4
46672,Leonard,18, Thank you for your time.,9,Big Bang Theory,25,5
46673,Sheldon,18, Couple of questions about the plaque.,9,Big Bang Theory,38,6
46675,Amy,18," So, have you been having any morning sickness?",9,Big Bang Theory,47,8
46677,Penny,18, Is that a pregnancy thing?,9,Big Bang Theory,27,5
46679,Penny,18, But now you'll be able to make your own milk to eat the cookies with.,9,Big Bang Theory,70,15
46680,Raj,18," Hey, guys. Hey, Penny. I really appreciate you helping me with this. I don't know what to do.",9,Big Bang Theory,94,18
46681,Penny,18," Oh, sure. Let me see it.",9,Big Bang Theory,25,6
46682,Amy,18, See what?,9,Big Bang Theory,10,2
46683,Raj,18," I hadn't spoken to Emily since I broke up with her, and she left this on my doorstep with a note.",9,Big Bang Theory,98,21
46684,Penny,18," Raj, I got you this before we split up, but couldn't return it and thought you'd like to have it. Happy belated Valentine's Day, Emily.",9,Big Bang Theory,136,25
46686,Penny,18," Nice, or is she trying to manipulate him?",9,Big Bang Theory,42,8
46687,Raj,18," I know. I mean, do I open it? Do I return it?",9,Big Bang Theory,46,12
46688,Amy,18, Why wouldn't you open it?,9,Big Bang Theory,26,5
46689,Raj,18," Well, she was pretty mad. For all I know it's a voodoo doll of me with a fork stuck in my junk.",9,Big Bang Theory,96,22
46691,Penny,18, I know one way to find out. Sniff this.,9,Big Bang Theory,40,9
46692,Amy,18," She's pregnant, she's not a bloodhound.",9,Big Bang Theory,40,6
46694,Penny,18," Come on, just open it.",9,Big Bang Theory,23,5
46695,Raj,18," You know, on Game of Thrones, Balon Greyjoy received his son's genitals in a box.",9,Big Bang Theory,82,15
46696,Penny,18," Well, never hurts to have a spare.",9,Big Bang Theory,35,7
46698,Raj,18, Wow. It's an antique sextant. Sailors used these to find their position by the stars.,9,Big Bang Theory,86,15
46699,Amy,18, What a nice gift for an astrophysicist.,9,Big Bang Theory,40,7
46700,Raj,18," I know, she's so thoughtful.",9,Big Bang Theory,29,5
46701,Penny,18," See, she's trying to get you back. Now, that is exactly what I would've gotten you if I had any idea what it is or what you do.",9,Big Bang Theory,128,28
46702,Raj,18," You know, I have too much self-esteem to let this girl guilt me into getting back together with her.",9,Big Bang Theory,101,19
46703,Amy,18, You don't need to be pregnant to smell that load of crap.,9,Big Bang Theory,58,12
46705,Leonard,18," Well, what if we go around the university and just get the patent ourselves?",9,Big Bang Theory,77,14
46706,Howard,18," We can't. It says on their Web site, as long as we work there, they have a controlling ownership of anything we come up with.",9,Big Bang Theory,126,25
46707,Sheldon,18," Great, so they own my idea for a T-shirt that says Dumb as a Bag of Geologists.",9,Big Bang Theory,80,17
46708,Leonard,18," Well, our choices are we do this with the university or we don't do it at all.",9,Big Bang Theory,79,17
46709,Howard,18," Either way, I get nothing.",9,Big Bang Theory,27,5
46710,Leonard,18," Or, if we ended up making money from this, Sheldon and I could split our shares with you.",9,Big Bang Theory,90,18
46711,Sheldon,18," To be clear, Leonard is referring to the gyroscope, not the T-shirt and mugs. Oh, now they own the mugs.",9,Big Bang Theory,105,20
46712,Howard,18, I guess that is a way around this. You guys would be cool doing it like that?,9,Big Bang Theory,78,17
46713,Leonard,18," Of course, we can split any profits three ways.",9,Big Bang Theory,48,9
46714,Sheldon,18, I'm fine with that.,9,Big Bang Theory,20,4
46715,Howard,18," Okay, great.",9,Big Bang Theory,13,2
46716,Sheldon,18," It sounds like a, uh, contract might be in order.",9,Big Bang Theory,50,10
46717,Leonard,18," Sure, we could write something up.",9,Big Bang Theory,35,6
46718,Sheldon,18, But which one of us should be the party who,9,Big Bang Theory,44,10
46719,Howard,18," You can do it, Sheldon.",9,Big Bang Theory,24,5
46720,Sheldon,18, So stipulated.,9,Big Bang Theory,15,2
46721,Leonard,18, Once I found a stash of contracts under his bed. It was weird.,9,Big Bang Theory,63,13
46724,Amy,18," Ooh, let's find out.",9,Big Bang Theory,21,4
46725,Raj,18, It doesn't matter. It's the thought that counts.,9,Big Bang Theory,49,8
46726,Penny,18," Yeah, yeah, and beauty's on the inside, size doesn't matter, how much she spend?",9,Big Bang Theory,81,14
46727,Raj,18," Seriously, guys, I don't want to know.",9,Big Bang Theory,39,7
46728,Amy,18," Oh, my.",9,Big Bang Theory,8,2
46729,Raj,18," Oh, come on, you can't say oh my, and then not tell me.",9,Big Bang Theory,56,13
46730,Amy,18, These things go for five hundred dollars and up.,9,Big Bang Theory,49,9
46732,Penny,18," Okay, so, she drops off a five hundred dollar gift and she's not trying to get back together with you?",9,Big Bang Theory,103,20
46733,Raj,18, Maybe you're right.,9,Big Bang Theory,20,3
46735,Raj,18," Maybe you're right. Wow, I am easy to manipulate.  Oh, guys, it's Emily. What should I do?",9,Big Bang Theory,91,17
46736,Penny,18," Okay, answer it. Just be strong. And if she starts to cry, don't make any promises. And most importantly, put it on speaker so we can hear.",9,Big Bang Theory,140,27
46737,Raj,18, Hello?,9,Big Bang Theory,7,1
46739,Raj,18," Yeah, yeah. Sure. What's up?",9,Big Bang Theory,29,5
46741,Raj,18," Maybe, maybe.",9,Big Bang Theory,14,2
46743,Raj,18," I'm sorry, I seem to be taking an annoying amount of time deciding how I feel about this.",9,Big Bang Theory,90,18
46745,Raj,18," I'm sorry, I don't think that's a good idea.",9,Big Bang Theory,45,9
46747,Raj,18," Good-bye, Emily. That was rough, you guys.",9,Big Bang Theory,43,7
46748,Penny,18," I know, but you did it. I'm so proud of you.",9,Big Bang Theory,45,11
46749,Raj,18," Well, anyway, I'll leave you to your girls' night.",9,Big Bang Theory,51,9
46750,Amy,18, Are you sure you don't want to stay here with us?,9,Big Bang Theory,50,11
46751,Raj,18," No, I kind of feel like being alone right now.",9,Big Bang Theory,47,10
46753,Raj,18, Thank you.,9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
46754,Penny,18, Say hi to Emily for us.,9,Big Bang Theory,24,6
46755,Raj,18, Will do.,9,Big Bang Theory,9,2
46757,Howard,18, This contract looks good to me.,9,Big Bang Theory,32,6
46758,Sheldon,18," I'll say it looks good. It's in my proprietary font, Shelvetica.",9,Big Bang Theory,65,11
46759,Leonard,18," I want to say something obnoxious, but it is easy on the eyes.",9,Big Bang Theory,63,13
46761,Howard,18," Yeah, one sec. I just need to sign this contract.",9,Big Bang Theory,50,10
46763,Howard,18," Well, we ran into a problem about my share of the patent, so we're forming a partnership to split anything we make equally.",9,Big Bang Theory,124,23
46764,Penny,18," Sheldon, did you draft the contract?",9,Big Bang Theory,37,6
46765,Sheldon,18, You bet I did.,9,Big Bang Theory,15,4
46766,Penny,18, Ooh. You're gonna make out so hard tonight.,9,Big Bang Theory,44,8
46768,Sheldon,18, Excuse me. I've been drafting contracts since kindergarten. Didn't need a lawyer to get me out of finger painting. Don't need one now.,9,Big Bang Theory,135,23
46770,Howard,18," Bernie, the guys were nice enough to find a way to keep me from being cut out.",9,Big Bang Theory,79,17
46772,Amy,18," Well, to be fair, Howard's idea was based on Sheldon's math.",9,Big Bang Theory,61,11
46773,Leonard,18," Guys, everyone is involved in thios, okay? Howard's invention, Sheldon's math, my original theory that space-time was like a supercooled liquid. Which I'm sure Penny would've mentioned if she wasn't working on that hangnail right now.",9,Big Bang Theory,235,36
46774,Penny,18, What?,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
46775,Howard,18," Honey, this is fine.",9,Big Bang Theory,21,4
46777,Howard,18, Can I talk to you in the hall?,9,Big Bang Theory,31,8
46779,Howard,18, Excuse us.,9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
46780,Sheldon,18," Hey, Leonard.",9,Big Bang Theory,14,2
46781,Leonard,18, What?,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
46782,Sheldon,18," If she doesn't think that we should apply for this patent, she's being patently absurd.",9,Big Bang Theory,88,15
46783,Leonard,18, Good one.,9,Big Bang Theory,10,2
46784,Sheldon,18," Okay, you got it. See, I was afraid it was a thinker.",9,Big Bang Theory,54,12
46785,Howard,18, What are you doing?,9,Big Bang Theory,20,4
46787,Howard,18, What's to think about? We have an invention and want to move forward.,9,Big Bang Theory,70,13
46789,Howard,18," All right, if you're gonna calmly make excellent points, then I don't know if I want to talk to you. Okay. I get it. And it's sweet that you're worried about me, but I can take care of myself.",9,Big Bang Theory,193,39
46791,Howard,18, Here we go with the ironclad logic again.,9,Big Bang Theory,42,8
46793,Howard,18, Is the foetus helping you? â€˜Cause that's cheating.,9,Big Bang Theory,53,8
46795,Raj,18, Hello?,9,Big Bang Theory,7,1
46797,Raj,18," Hi. I'm good. Really good. Well, I don't know why I said really good. I'm just regular good. I really just wanted to sound confident. And that really was a real really, not a fake really like the first really.",9,Big Bang Theory,210,40
46799,Raj,18," I don't know. I lost track and I missed my exit. So, uh, so what's up?",9,Big Bang Theory,71,16
46801,Raj,18, Really? I'm sorry. I swear I know other words.,9,Big Bang Theory,47,9
46803,Raj,18," Yes. Indeed. Absolutely. Indubitably. I'm not even sure what the last one means, but it's another word, and I know it. So, uh, when do you want to meet up?",9,Big Bang Theory,156,30
46805,Raj,18," Right now, well, well, actually, to, to be completely honest, I'm stopping by to see my ex-girlfriend because she's having a tough time. But it's not like we're getting back together or anything.",9,Big Bang Theory,196,33
46807,Raj,18, That's exactly what she said. How do you know that?,9,Big Bang Theory,52,10
46809,Raj,18, Any chance you could send me a PDF of that playbook?,9,Big Bang Theory,53,11
46811,Leonard,18, They've been out there a while.,9,Big Bang Theory,32,6
46812,Amy,18, I hope everything's okay.,9,Big Bang Theory,26,4
46813,Sheldon,18, I wonder what they're talking about.,9,Big Bang Theory,37,6
46814,Penny,18," If you guys would shut up, I could tell you. Oh. Be cool, be cool, be cool.",9,Big Bang Theory,76,17
46815,Howard,18, Hey.,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
46816,Sheldon,18, Hello.,9,Big Bang Theory,7,1
46817,Leonard,18, You guys all right?,9,Big Bang Theory,20,4
46818,Howard,18," Yeah. But, um, we were talking, and I'm a little concerned about the three of us forming a partnership.",9,Big Bang Theory,104,19
46819,Sheldon,18, Are you suggesting a limited liability corporation? â€˜Cause I did not L-L-see that coming.,9,Big Bang Theory,92,14
46820,Howard,18," Sheldon, my concern is not with the money or anything. It's, it's with how you treat me.",9,Big Bang Theory,89,17
46821,Sheldon,18," Well, I believe I'm treating you generously. That's why I've stipulated in the contract that your contributions to our invention are as valuable as my own.",9,Big Bang Theory,156,26
46823,Sheldon,18," No, I am not saying that, because I kept saying that this morning and Leonard said stop saying that.",9,Big Bang Theory,101,19
46824,Howard,18, See? This is what happens every time we work together.,9,Big Bang Theory,55,10
46825,Penny,18," You know what, hang on. What if Sheldon had no choice but to be respectful?",9,Big Bang Theory,76,15
46826,Leonard,18, What? Is there a switch on the back of his neck we don't know about?,9,Big Bang Theory,69,15
46827,Penny,18, No. What I'm saying is you could add a clause to the contract that he can't make fun of Howard.,9,Big Bang Theory,96,20
46829,Sheldon,18," Oh, please. Any contract I sign is enforced by my own personal code of ethics.",9,Big Bang Theory,79,15
46830,Amy,18, And his obsessive-compulsive disorder.,9,Big Bang Theory,39,4
46831,Sheldon,18," Yeah, that, too. And scoot over. Part of your shadow's on my spot.",9,Big Bang Theory,67,13
46832,Leonard,18," Howard, what do you think?",9,Big Bang Theory,27,5
46833,Howard,18, I'm on board.,9,Big Bang Theory,14,3
46834,Sheldon,18," I'll add it right now. Oh, baby, it's addendum time.",9,Big Bang Theory,53,10
46837,Raj,18," Hey, Emily, listen, I've been thinking, and I'm not sure it's a good idea that I come over.",9,Big Bang Theory,92,18
46839,Raj,18," No, no. Please don't cry.",9,Big Bang Theory,26,5
46842,Raj,18," Hey, so, listen, Claire, change of plans",9,Big Bang Theory,41,7
46844,Raj,18, I don't think so. She sounded pretty upset.,9,Big Bang Theory,44,8
46846,Raj,18," Emily, listen, I'm sorry, but I can't come by.",9,Big Bang Theory,47,9
46848,Raj,18," I think we both know if I come over, we're gonna get back together and",9,Big Bang Theory,71,15
46850,Raj,18, Call you right back.,9,Big Bang Theory,21,4
46852,Sheldon,18," The, the revisions I made start on page four.",9,Big Bang Theory,46,9
46853,Penny,18, Wow. That is a lot of whereupons.,9,Big Bang Theory,34,7
46854,Amy,18, You should see the Valentine's Day card he gave me.,9,Big Bang Theory,52,10
46855,Howard,18," Article three, as it pertains to this project, Dr. Sheldon Cooper promises to abstain from all insulting or disrespectful language directed toward Howard Wolowitz, including but not limited to mockery of engineering, his height, his hair, his wardrobe, and his insane belief that the Ghost Rider movie was, quote, not that bad.",9,Big Bang Theory,328,52
46856,Leonard,18," Hang on. Maybe there should be a no insult clause about me, too.",9,Big Bang Theory,65,13
46857,Sheldon,18, Do you still like cilantro?,9,Big Bang Theory,28,5
46858,Leonard,18, Yeah.,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
46859,Sheldon,18, You're tying my hands here.,9,Big Bang Theory,28,5
46860,Howard,18," All right, let's sign this.",9,Big Bang Theory,28,5
46861,Penny,18," Wait, wait, wait. What are these changes on page six?",9,Big Bang Theory,54,10
46862,Amy,18," Sheldon, what did you do?",9,Big Bang Theory,26,5
46863,Howard,18, I should've known.,9,Big Bang Theory,19,3
46865,Leonard,18, That beats the onesie I was gonna get them from baby Gap.,9,Big Bang Theory,58,12
46866,Howard,18," That's very generous, Sheldon.",9,Big Bang Theory,31,4
46867,Sheldon,18," Oh, I've always valued education over money. And the very fact that you needed a written guarantee of respect made me realize how dismissive I've been of your contributions.",9,Big Bang Theory,174,29
46868,Howard,18, I appreciate that.,9,Big Bang Theory,19,3
46869,Sheldon,18, And I just hope that this scholarship can rescue your child from the subpar education and menial life of an engineer.,9,Big Bang Theory,118,21
46870,Amy,18, Sheldon.,9,Big Bang Theory,9,1
46871,Sheldon,18, What? I didn't sign it yet.,9,Big Bang Theory,28,6
46873,Raj,18," I hear what you're saying, but I've known Emily a long time, and I think she deserves the benefit of the doubt.",9,Big Bang Theory,112,22
46875,Raj,18," As a matter of fact, I do. I'm gonna comfort her, because I'm a caring and decent friend who's happy to be there when she needs someone to talk to.",9,Big Bang Theory,148,30
46877,Raj,18, Good talk.,9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
46879,Amy,19, I didn't understand your e-mail.,9,Big Bang Theory,33,5
46880,Sheldon,19," Uh, can you repeat that? You're breaking up.",9,Big Bang Theory,45,8
46881,Amy,19, I didn't understand your e-mail.,9,Big Bang Theory,33,5
46882,Sheldon,19," Ah. Yeah, I had to get a little creative because the S, R and M keys on my laptop stopped working.",9,Big Bang Theory,99,21
46883,Amy,19," Deaw Aby, could you pleathe dwive be to the twain thtow thubtibe tobowow?",9,Big Bang Theory,74,13
46884,Sheldon,19," So, is that a yes?",9,Big Bang Theory,19,5
46885,Amy,19," Sheldon, why don't you get a new computer? You know that one's out-of-date.",9,Big Bang Theory,76,13
46886,Sheldon,19," Oh, but I like this computer.",9,Big Bang Theory,30,6
46887,Amy,19," The video is failing, and the sound is cutting out.",9,Big Bang Theory,52,10
46888,Sheldon,19," I'm sorry, I didn't get that.",9,Big Bang Theory,30,6
46889,Amy,19," The video is failing, and the sound is cutting out.",9,Big Bang Theory,52,10
46890,Sheldon,19, The sound is cutting out. I can't read that. The video is failing.,9,Big Bang Theory,67,13
46891,Amy,19, Get a new computer.,9,Big Bang Theory,20,4
46892,Sheldon,19, What?,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
46893,Amy,19, Get a new computer.,9,Big Bang Theory,20,4
46894,Sheldon,19, What?  Hello?,9,Big Bang Theory,14,2
46896,Leonard,19, This is cool. When was the last time you and I built something together?,9,Big Bang Theory,73,14
46897,Howard,19, Scientifically? A little over a year ago. LEGOs? Last week in my room.,9,Big Bang Theory,71,13
46898,Leonard,19," If there was a Nobel Prize for Millennium Falcons that fall apart when you pick them up, we'd be set.",9,Big Bang Theory,102,20
46899,Penny,19," Hey, guys.",9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
46900,Leonard,19, Hey. What are you doing here?,9,Big Bang Theory,30,6
46902,Penny,19," Yup, so we brought you some lunch and we are gonna go look for 'em.",9,Big Bang Theory,68,15
46903,Leonard,19," Soup, sandwiches and emasculation, just like my mom used to make.",9,Big Bang Theory,66,11
46904,Penny,19," So, how's it goin'?",9,Big Bang Theory,20,4
46905,Leonard,19, Good. Slow.,9,Big Bang Theory,12,2
46906,Howard,19," There's a lot of tedious setup, but once we get through that it should go quicker.",9,Big Bang Theory,83,16
46907,Penny,19, Is there anything we can do to help?,9,Big Bang Theory,37,8
46908,Leonard,19," You know what, this part isn't that technical. You actually could.",9,Big Bang Theory,67,11
46909,Penny,19," Wow, really? Called my bluff. All righty then.",9,Big Bang Theory,47,8
46911,Howard,19," While we finish soldering these boards, it'd be great if you guys could wrap these pipe fittings with Teflon tape.",9,Big Bang Theory,115,20
46912,Leonard,19, I'll show you how to do one.,9,Big Bang Theory,29,7
46913,Penny,19," Hey, wouldn't it be funny if after all your years of hard work, I'm the one who makes a scientific breakthrough? He doesn't think that's funny.",9,Big Bang Theory,144,26
46915,Amy,19, I got here as quickly as I could.,9,Big Bang Theory,34,8
46916,Sheldon,19, You're too late.,9,Big Bang Theory,17,3
46917,Amy,19," Sheldon, this is silly.",9,Big Bang Theory,24,4
46918,Sheldon,19, You got emotional when that lab monkey died.,9,Big Bang Theory,45,8
46919,Amy,19, That lab monkey told me he loved me in sign language.,9,Big Bang Theory,54,11
46920,Sheldon,19, Great. Now I'm gonna have that song in my head all day.,9,Big Bang Theory,56,12
46921,Amy,19," Look, I'm, I'm sorry for your loss, but I think I have something that might make you feel better. I got you a new computer.",9,Big Bang Theory,124,25
46922,Sheldon,19, How could you do that?,9,Big Bang Theory,23,5
46923,Amy,19, Do what?,9,Big Bang Theory,9,2
46924,Sheldon,19," Choosing a new laptop Is an incredibly personal ritual. You have taken away weeks of agonizing thought, tedious research, sleepless nights filled with indecision. I, haven't I lost enough today?",9,Big Bang Theory,195,30
46925,Amy,19," Well, the guy at the store said this one is great.",9,Big Bang Theory,51,11
46926,Sheldon,19," Oh, oh, the guy. Oh, pardon me. I didn't realize you'd spoken to the guy. Yeah, tell me, did the guy choose one with a 4K display and a Thunderbolt port?",9,Big Bang Theory,154,31
46927,Amy,19, Yes.,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
46928,Sheldon,19, Yeah? Did the guy make sure that this has a one terabyte solid-state drive?,9,Big Bang Theory,76,14
46929,Amy,19, Yes.,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
46930,Sheldon,19," Yeah? Oh, well, was this guy Rick from Computer Solutions on Colorado?",9,Big Bang Theory,71,12
46931,Amy,19, Yes.,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
46932,Sheldon,19," Yeah, well, he does know his stuff.",9,Big Bang Theory,36,7
46934,Leonard,19," After you wrap the body in reflective tape, the ends get Teflon tape so we can get a tight seal.",9,Big Bang Theory,97,20
46935,Penny,19, Like this?,9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
46936,Leonard,19," Yeah, perfect.",9,Big Bang Theory,15,2
46937,Penny,19, Oh.,9,Big Bang Theory,4,1
46938,Leonard,19," And it helps to have small, delicate fingers. So don't be discouraged if you can't do it as fast as me and Howard.",9,Big Bang Theory,115,23
46939,Howard,19, I don't know if we have enough solder to finish these circuit boards.,9,Big Bang Theory,70,13
46940,Leonard,19, We had a full spool yesterday.,9,Big Bang Theory,31,6
46941,Howard,19," What can I say, I play hard, I solder even harder.",9,Big Bang Theory,51,11
46943,Leonard,19," Well, we got to make a run to the hardware store.",9,Big Bang Theory,50,11
46944,Penny,19, How can you call yourself a scientist and run out of solder?,9,Big Bang Theory,61,12
46945,Leonard,19," Well, funny story. So, we have plenty of the 60/40 tin-to-lead ratio solder, but the spools look a lot like the 63/37 tin-to-lead",9,Big Bang Theory,130,23
46946,Penny,19," Honey, honey, honey, let me stop you. That is, is not a funny story.",9,Big Bang Theory,69,14
46947,Howard,19, You want to come with us?,9,Big Bang Theory,26,6
46949,Penny,19," Yeah, you guys run to the store and let the women handle the science for a change.",9,Big Bang Theory,83,17
46950,Leonard,19, Okay. We'll be back as soon as we can.,9,Big Bang Theory,39,9
46951,Penny,19," Okay, so what is solder?",9,Big Bang Theory,25,5
46953,Sheldon,19," I suppose I should set this up. Or would you like to rob me of that, too?",9,Big Bang Theory,74,17
46954,Amy,19, Knock it off or I'll start making W-H sounds for words that just have a W.,9,Big Bang Theory,75,16
46955,Sheldon,19, You wouldn't.,9,Big Bang Theory,14,2
46956,Amy,19, Whatch me.,9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
46957,Sheldon,19," Fine. I'm sorry. Thank you for the thoughtful gift. I really do appreciate it. As you know, I had become attached to my old laptop. But I'm sure, in time, that this one will Jeepers creepers, that started up fast.",9,Big Bang Theory,214,40
46958,Amy,19, I thought you might like it.,9,Big Bang Theory,29,6
46959,Sheldon,19," Look at the 4K resolution. Next time we Skype, I'm gonna count all those nostril hairs.",9,Big Bang Theory,88,16
46960,Amy,19, Or you could just look into my eyes.,9,Big Bang Theory,37,8
46961,Sheldon,19, But you only have two eyes. You got a lot of nostril hairs.,9,Big Bang Theory,60,13
46962,Amy,19," Well, you know, as long as you're happy.",9,Big Bang Theory,41,8
46963,Sheldon,19, Oh. I am.,9,Big Bang Theory,10,3
46964,Amy,19, And Rick said you could bring in your old one to recycle it.,9,Big Bang Theory,61,13
46965,Sheldon,19," Oh. Uh, no, no, no, thank you.",9,Big Bang Theory,31,7
46966,Amy,19," Oh, but he said you can get store credit.",9,Big Bang Theory,42,9
46967,Sheldon,19," Well, no, I just, I, I don't want to recycle it. And I don't want store credit.",9,Big Bang Theory,80,17
46968,Amy,19, But why wouldn't,9,Big Bang Theory,17,3
46969,Sheldon,19, Can we please change the subject?,9,Big Bang Theory,34,6
46970,Amy,19, Okay. How 'bout we change it to why you're being weird about this?,9,Big Bang Theory,67,13
46971,Sheldon,19," I'm not being weird. I, it's hard to explain.",9,Big Bang Theory,46,9
46972,Amy,19," Sheldon, just tell me.",9,Big Bang Theory,23,4
46973,Sheldon,19, It might be easier to show you.,9,Big Bang Theory,32,7
46974,Amy,19, Okay.,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
46975,Sheldon,19, We'd have to take your car.,9,Big Bang Theory,28,6
46976,Amy,19, All right.,9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
46977,Sheldon,19, And I'm gonna need you to sign a non-disclosure agreement.,9,Big Bang Theory,59,10
46978,Amy,19," Well, I signed one before we slept together. Why not now?",9,Big Bang Theory,58,11
46980,Leonard,19, Penny says they're having fun working on the prototype.,9,Big Bang Theory,56,9
46981,Howard,19, Remember when her fun was nightclubs and drinking games?,9,Big Bang Theory,57,9
46982,Leonard,19, I know. I'm lowering the bar so slowly. This time next year she'll have a coin collection.,9,Big Bang Theory,91,17
46984,Leonard,19," Oh. Sorry, we can't.",9,Big Bang Theory,21,4
46985,Howard,19," Well, hang on. What movie is it?",9,Big Bang Theory,33,7
46987,Howard,19, Wait. I bet it's Suicide Squad. Let's check it out.,9,Big Bang Theory,52,10
46988,Leonard,19, What about the girls?,9,Big Bang Theory,22,4
46989,Howard,19," Penny just said they're having fun. Honestly, you want to wrap tape around a bunch of pipe fittings all afternoon?",9,Big Bang Theory,115,20
46990,Leonard,19," Okay, we'll take 'em. But, I swear, if it's Will Smith in Shark Tale 2, it better be at least as good as the original.",9,Big Bang Theory,119,25
46992,Penny,19," I mean, it's crazy, isn't it? I moved here from Nebraska to be an actress, and now I'm sitting in an engineering lab at Caltech helping to build a prototype for a high-tech guidance system.",9,Big Bang Theory,190,35
46994,Raj,19, Hey. Where are the guys?,9,Big Bang Theory,25,5
46995,Penny,19," Oh, they went to the store to get solder, which is metal you melt to make science things.",9,Big Bang Theory,90,18
46997,Raj,19, I'm an astrophysicist. The stars don't take a day off.,9,Big Bang Theory,55,10
46998,Penny,19, You were home alone and had no one to play with?,9,Big Bang Theory,49,11
46999,Raj,19," Well, the cleaning lady was there, but she doesn't like me. You need any help?",9,Big Bang Theory,79,15
47001,Penny,19, I think we're good.,9,Big Bang Theory,20,4
47002,Raj,19," Okay. That's cool. I guess everybody's involved in this project but me. So, see ya.",9,Big Bang Theory,84,15
47004,Raj,19, Yes.,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
47006,Amy,19, Will you please tell me where we're going?,9,Big Bang Theory,43,8
47007,Sheldon,19," Sorry, you're on a need-to-know basis.",9,Big Bang Theory,39,6
47008,Amy,19, I'm driving the car. I need to know.,9,Big Bang Theory,37,8
47009,Sheldon,19, Right.,9,Big Bang Theory,7,1
47010,Amy,19, So where are we going?,9,Big Bang Theory,23,5
47011,Sheldon,19," No, I meant turn right, and you missed it. Maybe you do need to know.",9,Big Bang Theory,70,15
47013,Leonard,19, What are we gonna tell the girls?,9,Big Bang Theory,34,7
47014,Howard,19, It's not a problem.,9,Big Bang Theory,20,4
47015,Leonard,19, I mean without lying.,9,Big Bang Theory,22,4
47016,Howard,19, And now you've made it a problem.,9,Big Bang Theory,34,7
47017,Leonard,19, Come on. We're a couple of smart guys. I'm sure we can come up with a way to explain this that doesn't make us look bad.,9,Big Bang Theory,121,26
47018,Penny,19," Oh, the boys had to drive all the way to San Bernardino for the solder and got a flat.",9,Big Bang Theory,87,19
47019,Leonard,19, They bought it.,9,Big Bang Theory,16,3
47020,Howard,19, But we're gonna have to put the spare on before we go back.,9,Big Bang Theory,60,13
47021,Leonard,19," Oh, you're good at this.",9,Big Bang Theory,25,5
47022,Howard,19," Well, I lie a lot.",9,Big Bang Theory,19,5
47024,Leonard,19," Hey, you were right.",9,Big Bang Theory,21,4
47025,Howard,19," Well, I keep telling you, good things happen to bad people.",9,Big Bang Theory,60,11
47027,Leonard,19, Who are you texting?,9,Big Bang Theory,21,4
47028,Howard,19, Raj. He really wants to see this movie.,9,Big Bang Theory,40,8
47029,Leonard,19, He'll never make it in time.,9,Big Bang Theory,29,6
47030,Howard,19, I know. I want to make him feel bad.,9,Big Bang Theory,37,9
47031,Leonard,19," Ha, ha. Leonard and I are about to see Suicide Squad. Spoiler alert, when I see you I'm gonna spoil it. You're a good friend.",9,Big Bang Theory,126,25
47032,Raj,19, Okay. Would you ladies please leave the room for a moment?,9,Big Bang Theory,59,11
47033,Penny,19, Why?,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
47034,Raj,19, I need to rub my genitals on their prototype.,9,Big Bang Theory,46,9
47036,Raj,19, Leonard and Howard don't have a flat. They went to the movies. Look.,9,Big Bang Theory,69,13
47037,Penny,19, Un-freakin' believable.,9,Big Bang Theory,24,2
47039,Raj,19, Oh. You know what? I'm gonna let them know that I'm here with you and that they're busted.,9,Big Bang Theory,91,18
47040,Penny,19, No. You know what? Don't. Don't. Let's let them think they're getting away with it.,9,Big Bang Theory,84,15
47042,Penny,19, Mm-hmm.,9,Big Bang Theory,8,1
47043,Raj,19," Interesting. I mean, it's not testicles on a cryostat, but I like it.",9,Big Bang Theory,70,13
47045,Amy,19, Why do you have a storage unit?,9,Big Bang Theory,32,7
47046,Sheldon,19, Just wait.,9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
47047,Amy,19, How long have you had it?,9,Big Bang Theory,26,6
47048,Sheldon,19, Just wait.,9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
47049,Amy,19, Do you want me to hold that computer?,9,Big Bang Theory,38,8
47050,Sheldon,19," Just wait. You know what? Actually, yes, thank you. Welcome to my Fortress of Shame.",9,Big Bang Theory,85,15
47051,Amy,19," I'm sorry. What, what am I looking at?",9,Big Bang Theory,39,8
47052,Sheldon,19," It's basically everything I've ever owned. Um, every book, every tee shirt, every piece of broken electronics. Just all of it.",9,Big Bang Theory,127,21
47053,Amy,19, All of it?,9,Big Bang Theory,11,3
47054,Sheldon,19, I have a Ziploc bag filled with all my old Ziploc bags.,9,Big Bang Theory,56,12
47055,Amy,19," Okay. Well, I would like to tell you that there is nothing here to be ashamed of. So I'm gonna need a minute.",9,Big Bang Theory,110,23
47057,Penny,19," All right, how are we gonna play this when they return?",9,Big Bang Theory,56,11
47058,Raj,19, I know. You guys should totally be making out with me.,9,Big Bang Theory,55,11
47059,Penny,19," Sweetie, I know you think jokes like that are funny, but do you really think you could handle making out with both of us?",9,Big Bang Theory,122,24
47060,Raj,19," No, ma'am.",9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
47062,Penny,19," Yeah, that's pretty good.",9,Big Bang Theory,26,4
47063,Raj,19," I love it, I'll be all like, busted, and they'll be like, what? And then we'll all be like, oh yeah. Yeah, I get it. I wouldn't make out with me, either.",9,Big Bang Theory,154,32
47065,Sheldon,19," In here is every clock radio I've ever owned. Calculators, VHS tapes. Yeah. Oh. Sporting equipment.",9,Big Bang Theory,100,16
47066,Amy,19, You have sporting equipment?,9,Big Bang Theory,29,4
47067,Sheldon,19," Well, oh, it's just a, it's a, a golf ball that my brother threw at my head. You can still feel the dent. It's right next to the hockey puck dent.",9,Big Bang Theory,147,31
47068,Amy,19," Okay, why do you have a bin of pine cones?",9,Big Bang Theory,43,10
47069,Sheldon,19," I used to collect them as a child. The spiral of scales open in the Fibonacci sequence. A fact that, when you tell your brother, gets a golf ball thrown at your head.",9,Big Bang Theory,167,33
47070,Amy,19," So, why do you feel you need to save these things?",9,Big Bang Theory,51,11
47071,Sheldon,19," I'd like to say it's nostalgia, but every time I think of throwing anything away, my ears start to ring, and I get butterflies in my stomach. And then it feels like the butterflies get eaten by rats, and then the, the rats get eaten by",9,Big Bang Theory,236,46
47072,Amy,19, Okay. I get it. I get it.,9,Big Bang Theory,26,7
47073,Sheldon,19, It ends with dinosaurs. I'm sorry if you think less of me.,9,Big Bang Theory,59,12
47074,Amy,19, I don't.,9,Big Bang Theory,9,2
47075,Sheldon,19," Really? â€˜Cause every time I come in here, I think less of me.",9,Big Bang Theory,64,13
47076,Amy,19, Why?,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
47077,Sheldon,19," Because I'm a fraud. No. I purport to be a man of the mind. I've been such a, a vocal champion of the singularity, but how can I leave my body behind and become one with the internet when I've never even thrown a toothbrush away?",9,Big Bang Theory,230,46
47078,Amy,19," It's okay, Sheldon. You know, I've saved a lot of weird things, too.",9,Big Bang Theory,69,13
47079,Sheldon,19, Like what?,9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
47080,Amy,19," Well, um, did you know I have a microscope slide with a little bit of tissue from the first brain I ever dissected?",9,Big Bang Theory,116,23
47081,Sheldon,19, I have an old teddy bear I secretly wiped my nose on for years.,9,Big Bang Theory,64,14
47082,Amy,19, It's not a contest.,9,Big Bang Theory,20,4
47084,Penny,19," Okay, here they come.",9,Big Bang Theory,22,4
47086,Raj,19," Oh, man, when I come out of the closet, I'm gonna nail those guys. Yeah, I heard it. Shut up.",9,Big Bang Theory,94,20
47087,Leonard,19, Hey.,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
47088,Howard,19, Hi.,9,Big Bang Theory,4,1
47089,Penny,19," Hey, what's this?",9,Big Bang Theory,18,3
47090,Leonard,19," Listen, we did a stupid thing.",9,Big Bang Theory,31,6
47091,Howard,19," We went to a movie and lied about it, but we feel bad and want to make it up to you.",9,Big Bang Theory,85,21
47092,Leonard,19," So, these are for you, and if you're not too mad, we'd love to take you guys to dinner.",9,Big Bang Theory,88,19
47093,Howard,19, Yeah. Anywhere you want.,9,Big Bang Theory,25,4
47095,Penny,19," Yeah. You know, I want to be upset, but we did kind of have fun working on the prototype.",9,Big Bang Theory,90,19
47096,Raj,19, Don't forgive them. Stay mad at them.,9,Big Bang Theory,38,7
47097,Howard,19, What is he doing in there?,9,Big Bang Theory,27,6
47098,Raj,19, Busting you.,9,Big Bang Theory,13,2
47100,Penny,19," Yeah, it's fine.",9,Big Bang Theory,17,3
47101,Raj,19, Well this is kind of anti-climactic.,9,Big Bang Theory,37,6
47102,Howard,19, You know what wasn't anti-climactic? The end of the movie. Get this.,9,Big Bang Theory,69,12
47103,Raj,19, No spoilers. No spoilers.,9,Big Bang Theory,26,4
47104,Penny,19, And he's back in the closet.,9,Big Bang Theory,29,6
47105,Howard,19, Ready for dinner?,9,Big Bang Theory,18,3
47106,Penny,19, Yeah.,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
47108,Raj,19, Yes.,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
47110,Amy,19," So, no one else knows about this?",9,Big Bang Theory,34,7
47111,Sheldon,19, Only you.,9,Big Bang Theory,10,2
47112,Amy,19, Thank you for trusting me.,9,Big Bang Theory,27,5
47113,Sheldon,19, What good is having a girlfriend if you can't unload your psychological sewage on her?,9,Big Bang Theory,87,15
47114,Amy,19," That's me, your emotional outhouse. You know, if you ever decide you want to do something about this, I'm, I'm here for you.",9,Big Bang Theory,125,23
47115,Sheldon,19, Thank you. I wouldn't even know how to begin.,9,Big Bang Theory,46,9
47116,Amy,19," Baby steps, I guess.",9,Big Bang Theory,21,4
47117,Sheldon,19, I suppose I could try getting rid of the golf ball.,9,Big Bang Theory,52,11
47118,Amy,19, Oh. Okay.,9,Big Bang Theory,10,2
47119,Sheldon,19, I will always have the dent to remember it by.,9,Big Bang Theory,47,10
47120,Amy,19, You did it. Do you feel okay?,9,Big Bang Theory,30,7
47121,Sheldon,19," Actually, yes. I do.",9,Big Bang Theory,21,4
47122,Amy,19," Well, I'm proud of you.",9,Big Bang Theory,24,5
47123,Sheldon,19, Thanks.,9,Big Bang Theory,8,1
47125,Sheldon,19, I'm glad I told you about the storage unit.,9,Big Bang Theory,44,9
47126,Amy,19," Well, I feel closer to you now.",9,Big Bang Theory,32,7
47127,Sheldon,19," Oh, I feel closer to you, too. You know, it's still a couple of hours until my bedtime.",9,Big Bang Theory,88,18
47128,Amy,19, What did you have in mind?,9,Big Bang Theory,27,6
47130,Sheldon,19," You look amazing. I mean, this resolution is remarkable.",9,Big Bang Theory,57,9
47131,Amy,19, I really had to go home for this?,9,Big Bang Theory,34,8
47132,Sheldon,19," Yes, but it's like you're right here in the room.",9,Big Bang Theory,50,10
47133,Amy,19," And yet, I'm not.",9,Big Bang Theory,18,4
47134,Sheldon,19, But I feel like I could reach out and touch you.,9,Big Bang Theory,49,11
47135,Amy,19," And yet, you can't.",9,Big Bang Theory,20,4
47136,Sheldon,19, I know.,9,Big Bang Theory,8,2
47138,Sheldon,20," It's nice to get back to nature. Why don't I do this more often? What a beautiful forest. Hello, little butterfly. What's your Na-oh!",9,Big Bang Theory,134,24
47139,Leonard,20, Whatcha doing?,9,Big Bang Theory,15,2
47140,Sheldon,20," I was enjoying some virtual reality, until you ruined it with your actual face.",9,Big Bang Theory,80,14
47141,Penny,20, What am I smelling?,9,Big Bang Theory,20,4
47142,Sheldon,20," Oh, it's car air freshener. I was simulating the smell of the forest.",9,Big Bang Theory,70,13
47143,Penny,20, That's not what the forest smells like.,9,Big Bang Theory,40,7
47144,Sheldon,20," Well, how would I know?",9,Big Bang Theory,24,5
47145,Leonard,20, Why are you pretending to be outdoors? You hate it.,9,Big Bang Theory,52,10
47146,Sheldon,20, Hmm? Oh. Amy showed me a compelling study that demonstrated the cognitive benefit of spending time in the wilderness.,9,Big Bang Theory,118,19
47147,Leonard,20," Buddy, I am ready to drive you into the wilderness any time you want and leave you there.",9,Big Bang Theory,90,18
47148,Sheldon,20," Well, make your jokes, but some of the participants who spent four days in the woods away from all technology reported a fifty percent gain in reasoning skills upon their return.",9,Big Bang Theory,179,31
47149,Penny,20," Okay, if that's true, why aren't there more genius squirrels?",9,Big Bang Theory,62,10
47150,Sheldon,20, You may need this more than I do.,9,Big Bang Theory,34,8
47152,Amy,20, Here's your tea.,9,Big Bang Theory,17,3
47153,Sheldon,20, Oh. Do not sneak up on a guy when he's sitting on a log.,9,Big Bang Theory,57,14
47154,Amy,20," You know, if you really want to be in nature, why don't we rent a cabin?",9,Big Bang Theory,73,16
47155,Sheldon,20," Look, I'm sorry, when did you even get here? I",9,Big Bang Theory,47,10
47156,Penny,20," You know, there's a cabin in Big Bear that a doctor I work with keeps offering me.",9,Big Bang Theory,83,17
47157,Leonard,20, Because he's hitting on you?,9,Big Bang Theory,29,5
47158,Penny,20, She.,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
47159,Leonard,20," Oh, good.",9,Big Bang Theory,10,2
47160,Penny,20, But I could get her.,9,Big Bang Theory,21,5
47161,Amy,20, We could all go for the weekend. It'll be fun.,9,Big Bang Theory,47,10
47162,Sheldon,20," Excuse me. Here, look up fun, get back to me.",9,Big Bang Theory,46,10
47163,Leonard,20, You and I could still go and have a nice weekend.,9,Big Bang Theory,50,11
47164,Penny,20, Sure.,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
47165,Amy,20," Come on, Sheldon, let's go with them.",9,Big Bang Theory,38,7
47166,Sheldon,20," I hardly think so. You be sure and say hello to all the mosquitoes, bees, bears, snakes, possums, poison oak, oh, and last, but not least, teenagers with guitars.",9,Big Bang Theory,163,29
47167,Penny,20, I'll see if it's available.,9,Big Bang Theory,28,5
47168,Amy,20," You know, if that study's real, Leonard might come back smarter than you.",9,Big Bang Theory,74,13
47169,Sheldon,20, Are you trying to manipulate me?,9,Big Bang Theory,33,6
47170,Amy,20, Yes.,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
47171,Sheldon,20," Well done, it worked, we're going.",9,Big Bang Theory,35,6
47172,Amy,20, Yay.,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
47175,Raj,20," No, no, you're pregnant. The only thing you carry is our hope for a better tomorrow.",9,Big Bang Theory,85,16
47176,Howard,20," Hey, where you been?",9,Big Bang Theory,21,4
47178,Howard,20," Did you get graham crackers? I mean, are, wuh, is the baby okay?",9,Big Bang Theory,65,13
47180,Howard,20, I didn't know you needed help running errands today.,9,Big Bang Theory,53,9
47182,Howard,20, Really?,9,Big Bang Theory,8,1
47184,Howard,20," Oh. Well, I guess that's kind of sweet.",9,Big Bang Theory,40,8
47185,Raj,20," Bernie, I just forwarded you a list of the top five lactation consultants in Los Angeles. I know my favourite, but I'd love to hear what you think.",9,Big Bang Theory,148,28
47186,Howard,20, And it just got weird.,9,Big Bang Theory,23,5
47188,Penny,20, Hey. Amy's downstairs.,9,Big Bang Theory,23,3
47189,Leonard,20," Okay, one sec.",9,Big Bang Theory,15,3
47190,Penny,20," Uh, what, what you got goin' on here?",9,Big Bang Theory,38,8
47191,Leonard,20, I bought a baseball cap.,9,Big Bang Theory,25,5
47192,Penny,20, I can see that. What team did you get?,9,Big Bang Theory,39,9
47193,Leonard,20," Uh, Hufflepuff, from Harry Potter.",9,Big Bang Theory,35,5
47194,Penny,20," Well, we'll be in the woods.",9,Big Bang Theory,29,6
47195,Sheldon,20, I'm ready to go.,9,Big Bang Theory,17,4
47196,Leonard,20, Anything you'd like to say to him?,9,Big Bang Theory,35,7
47197,Penny,20," Nice hat, Sheldon.",9,Big Bang Theory,19,3
47198,Sheldon,20, Thanks.,9,Big Bang Theory,8,1
47199,Leonard,20, Why are you so mean to me?,9,Big Bang Theory,27,7
47201,Howard,20, What the hell are you watching?,9,Big Bang Theory,32,6
47203,Howard,20," Okay, that is the least Jewish thing I've ever seen in my life. You feel like Raj is getting a little carried away with all the baby stuff?",9,Big Bang Theory,140,28
47205,Howard,20," All right, if you say so. What's in the box?",9,Big Bang Theory,45,10
47207,Howard,20, Oh. That's cool. Can we try it?,9,Big Bang Theory,32,7
47209,Howard,20, So he can be part of the experience?,9,Big Bang Theory,37,8
47211,Howard,20, I'm surprised he let us conceive without him.,9,Big Bang Theory,46,8
47214,Penny,20, It's so cute and rustic up here.,9,Big Bang Theory,33,7
47215,Leonard,20, I know. Did you see they still have a video rental place? it's like Colonial Williamsburg.,9,Big Bang Theory,91,16
47216,Sheldon,20," Well, cell service is down to one bar, so if anyone needs medical attention or to tell a stranger their political views are stupid, now's the time.",9,Big Bang Theory,148,27
47217,Amy,20, Have you ever been off the grid before?,9,Big Bang Theory,40,8
47218,Sheldon,20, Once. The battery ran out on my phone. I had to wait for my iPad to turn on.,9,Big Bang Theory,77,18
47219,Leonard,20, I was afraid he was gonna eat me.,9,Big Bang Theory,34,8
47221,Howard,20, Raj just pulled up. I'm gonna say something to him.,9,Big Bang Theory,52,10
47223,Howard,20, So you don't think he needs to rein it in a little?,9,Big Bang Theory,52,12
47225,Howard,20," And you're not concerned he's acting like somehow this is his kid, too?",9,Big Bang Theory,72,13
47227,Howard,20, Just supportive. Not over-the-top in any way?,9,Big Bang Theory,46,7
47229,Raj,20, Hello.,9,Big Bang Theory,7,1
47231,Howard,20, Astronauts saw him carrying that.,9,Big Bang Theory,34,5
47233,Penny,20, This place is great.,9,Big Bang Theory,21,4
47234,Leonard,20, So nice of that doctor to just let you use it.,9,Big Bang Theory,47,11
47235,Penny,20," Well, she is taking me to an Indigo Girls concert, so hold that thought.",9,Big Bang Theory,73,14
47236,Sheldon,20," Okay. Well, shall we check each other for ticks?",9,Big Bang Theory,49,9
47237,Amy,20," Sheldon, all we did was walk in from the car.",9,Big Bang Theory,46,10
47238,Sheldon,20," Oh. Well, suit yourself. Who wants to check me?",9,Big Bang Theory,48,9
47239,Amy,20," On the other hand, safety first.",9,Big Bang Theory,33,6
47241,Amy,20," Wow, it's really coming down.",9,Big Bang Theory,30,5
47242,Penny,20, This sucks.,9,Big Bang Theory,12,2
47243,Leonard,20, And there goes our hike.,9,Big Bang Theory,25,5
47244,Sheldon,20," Oh, not our hike, now we have to stay safe and warm.",9,Big Bang Theory,53,12
47245,Penny,20," You know, we could still go. A little rain isn't gonna kill us.",9,Big Bang Theory,64,13
47246,Leonard,20, Have you been outside in the rain with Sheldon?,9,Big Bang Theory,48,9
47247,Penny,20, No.,9,Big Bang Theory,4,1
47248,Leonard,20, You'll wish it would kill you.,9,Big Bang Theory,31,6
47249,Amy,20, So what do we do now?,9,Big Bang Theory,22,6
47250,Leonard,20, They have some board games.,9,Big Bang Theory,28,5
47251,Sheldon,20," Eh, most of the Jenga pieces are missing and the Scrabble only has seven tiles, so unless you want to build an unimpressive structure with the word shnerpf next to it, move on.",9,Big Bang Theory,177,33
47252,Penny,20," Hey, let's light a fire.",9,Big Bang Theory,25,5
47253,Amy,20," Ooh, that sounds cozy.",9,Big Bang Theory,23,4
47254,Leonard,20, I don't think I've lit a real fire before.,9,Big Bang Theory,43,9
47255,Sheldon,20," Ah, it's basic thermodynamics. I'm sure we can figure that out.",9,Big Bang Theory,64,11
47256,Leonard,20, I could stack the logs conically to facilitate airflow.,9,Big Bang Theory,56,9
47257,Sheldon,20, That would maximize oxygen for optimal combustion.,9,Big Bang Theory,51,7
47258,Leonard,20, Right. So all we need is to,9,Big Bang Theory,28,7
47259,Penny,20, Got it.,9,Big Bang Theory,8,2
47260,Leonard,20, A scientist made that.,9,Big Bang Theory,23,4
47262,Howard,20," Look, Raj, you're my best friend in the world and I really appreciate your enthusiasm about the baby.",9,Big Bang Theory,102,18
47263,Raj,20," Please, my pleasure.",9,Big Bang Theory,21,3
47265,Howard,20, But we have to set some boundaries.,9,Big Bang Theory,36,7
47266,Raj,20, I don't understand.,9,Big Bang Theory,20,3
47267,Howard,20, The three of us aren't having this baby. Just the two of us.,9,Big Bang Theory,61,13
47268,Howard,20," Oh. Okay. Yeah, I get it. I'll back off.",9,Big Bang Theory,41,9
47269,Howard,20, Thanks for understanding.,9,Big Bang Theory,26,3
47270,Raj,20, Of course. I'll give you guys some space. Let me just get this out of your way.,9,Big Bang Theory,80,17
47271,Howard,20, You need some help?,9,Big Bang Theory,20,4
47272,Raj,20," No, I got it.",9,Big Bang Theory,14,4
47274,Raj,20," Please, Bernadette. Let me leave with my dignity.",9,Big Bang Theory,50,8
47276,Penny,20," Hey, you guys want to play a drinking game?",9,Big Bang Theory,44,9
47277,Sheldon,20," Oh, well now, we'll never win. You always play the drinking game.",9,Big Bang Theory,66,12
47278,Penny,20," Not the drinking game, a drinking game.",9,Big Bang Theory,40,7
47279,Leonard,20," To be fair, good at both.",9,Big Bang Theory,26,6
47280,Amy,20, What's the game?,9,Big Bang Theory,17,3
47281,Penny,20," All right, it's called Never Have I Ever. The rules are simple. Someone says something they've never done, but if you have done it, you take a drink.",9,Big Bang Theory,150,28
47282,Leonard,20, I've never played that before.,9,Big Bang Theory,31,5
47283,Sheldon,20," Hey, now, wait. Have we started? Do I drink? What is happening?",9,Big Bang Theory,64,12
47284,Penny,20," Okay. Calm down. I'll go first. All right, let's see. Never have I ever",9,Big Bang Theory,72,14
47285,Amy,20, She's trying to think of something she's never done before. This could take a while.,9,Big Bang Theory,85,15
47286,Penny,20," Very funny. Okay, never have I ever yeah, you know what? Let's just circle back.",9,Big Bang Theory,81,15
47287,Leonard,20," Okay, I'll go. Never have I ever been arrested.",9,Big Bang Theory,48,9
47288,Sheldon,20, So I drink.,9,Big Bang Theory,12,3
47289,Amy,20," No, it's only if you've done it.",9,Big Bang Theory,33,7
47290,Sheldon,20, Got it.,9,Big Bang Theory,8,2
47291,Amy,20, I can't believe you've been arrested.,9,Big Bang Theory,38,6
47292,Sheldon,20, I can't believe Penny hasn't.,9,Big Bang Theory,30,5
47293,Penny,20," Sheldon, what did you do?",9,Big Bang Theory,26,5
47294,Sheldon,20," Well, I'm not proud of it, but I jaywalked.",9,Big Bang Theory,44,9
47295,Leonard,20," Oh, no, it's like a horror movie. We're trapped in a cabin with a maniac.",9,Big Bang Theory,74,15
47296,Amy,20, I'm surprised you would do that.,9,Big Bang Theory,33,6
47297,Sheldon,20," No, I crossed in the middle of the street. And normally, I wouldn't, but I saw an aggressive-looking Girl Scout, and it was the heart of cookie season. Anyway, there was a police officer, and he witnessed the whole thing.",9,Big Bang Theory,222,40
47298,Penny,20," What, he arrested you for that?",9,Big Bang Theory,32,6
47299,Sheldon,20," No, he didn't do anything. So I said, you just saw me jaywalk, why aren't you doing your job? You know? May, maybe I should arrest you for, for impersonating a police officer.",9,Big Bang Theory,176,33
47300,Penny,20, And then you got arrested.,9,Big Bang Theory,27,5
47301,Sheldon,20," Oh, and how.",9,Big Bang Theory,13,3
47303,Howard,20, I feel like I just made a horrible mistake.,9,Big Bang Theory,44,9
47305,Howard,20," But on the other hand, I didn't kick him out of our lives. I just asked him to back off a little.",9,Big Bang Theory,98,22
47307,Howard,20, What? Are you gonna cry?,9,Big Bang Theory,25,5
47309,Howard,20, Is it baby hormones or actually sad?,9,Big Bang Theory,37,7
47311,Howard,20, I'll go get him.,9,Big Bang Theory,17,4
47314,Leonard,20, This game's dangerous. I could get you in trouble.,9,Big Bang Theory,51,9
47315,Penny,20, How?,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
47316,Leonard,20," Well, never have I ever used Sheldon's toothbrush to clean the sink.",9,Big Bang Theory,69,12
47317,Penny,20," Fine, is that how you want to play this? All right, never have I ever come up with a nickname for my own genitals.",9,Big Bang Theory,115,24
47318,Leonard,20, Never should've told you about Alvin and the Chipmunks.,9,Big Bang Theory,56,9
47319,Amy,20," Okay. My turn. Um, never have I ever completely rocked my girlfriend's world in bed.",9,Big Bang Theory,85,15
47320,Sheldon,20, Amy.,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
47321,Amy,20, You know the rules. Drink.,9,Big Bang Theory,27,5
47322,Penny,20," Yeah, go ahead.",9,Big Bang Theory,16,3
47323,Leonard,20, That's right.,9,Big Bang Theory,14,2
47324,Sheldon,20," All right, my turn. Mm. Oh, I know. Never have I ever kept a secret bank account, because I think my wife can't handle money. Did I win? I feel like I won.",9,Big Bang Theory,156,33
47325,Penny,20, I can't believe this. You realize I make more money than you?,9,Big Bang Theory,62,12
47326,Leonard,20," I don't, I know, but this isn't a big deal. It's just a little savings I put aside.",9,Big Bang Theory,84,18
47327,Penny,20, We're married. We're supposed to share everything.,9,Big Bang Theory,51,7
47328,Leonard,20," What, you mean, like, your massive credit card debt?",9,Big Bang Theory,53,9
47329,Sheldon,20, I'm calling it. I won.,9,Big Bang Theory,23,5
47331,Raj,20," I appreciate the apology, but it's really not necessary. I overstepped my bounds.",9,Big Bang Theory,82,13
47332,Howard,20," No, Raj, you've been great. I just, I need to start doing my part around here.",9,Big Bang Theory,79,16
47334,Raj,20," Well, if that's the case, is there anything I can do to help?",9,Big Bang Theory,62,13
47335,Howard,20," Well, not right now. But we could try out that microphone you got us, and listen to the baby's heartbeat.",9,Big Bang Theory,106,20
47336,Raj,20, Really? It's okay if I listen with you?,9,Big Bang Theory,40,8
47338,Raj,20, Can I squirt the ultrasound jelly on your stomach?,9,Big Bang Theory,51,9
47339,Howard,20," Hey, look at that. It's weird again.",9,Big Bang Theory,37,7
47341,Leonard,20," Okay, you have every right to be mad. And what you said is true. You do make more money than me. So I had no right to do what I did. And I'm so sorry. I hope you can forgive me.",9,Big Bang Theory,178,41
47342,Penny,20, How long have you had this secret account?,9,Big Bang Theory,43,8
47343,Leonard,20," A couple years, but I just put a few bucks aside every month for emergencies.",9,Big Bang Theory,78,15
47344,Penny,20," Well, how much you got in there?",9,Big Bang Theory,33,7
47345,Leonard,20, Six thousand four hundred and twenty seven dollars. Forty seven dollars once my nana's birthday check gets here.,9,Big Bang Theory,113,18
47346,Penny,20," My God, Leonard, do you know what I could do with that kind of money?",9,Big Bang Theory,70,15
47347,Leonard,20," No, I do, and that's why I hid it.",9,Big Bang Theory,35,9
47348,Penny,20, What good is it if you don't use it?,9,Big Bang Theory,37,9
47349,Leonard,20," Uh, you have shoes you love, but never wear. I have money I love, but never spend. We're kind of a cute couple that way. Again, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have kept it a secret.",9,Big Bang Theory,174,35
47350,Penny,20," Well, I have a secret I've been keeping from you, too.",9,Big Bang Theory,55,11
47351,Leonard,20, Is it a secret bank account? Because that would be awesome.,9,Big Bang Theory,60,11
47352,Penny,20, I hate my job.,9,Big Bang Theory,15,4
47353,Leonard,20, Really? Why?,9,Big Bang Theory,13,2
47354,Penny,20," Because I don't feel good flirting with doctors for sales. I mean, I know I make a lot of money. But I haven't been happy for a while.",9,Big Bang Theory,135,28
47355,Leonard,20, Why didn't you tell me?,9,Big Bang Theory,24,5
47356,Penny,20, Because I know how important it is to you that I'm having some success.,9,Big Bang Theory,72,14
47357,Leonard,20, That's not true.,9,Big Bang Theory,17,3
47358,Penny,20," Okay, really? So you'd be fine if I went back to acting and waiting tables again?",9,Big Bang Theory,82,16
47359,Leonard,20," If that's what you want to do, yes.",9,Big Bang Theory,36,8
47360,Penny,20," Well, it's not what I want to do.",9,Big Bang Theory,34,8
47361,Leonard,20," Oh, yes.",9,Big Bang Theory,9,2
47362,Penny,20," Doesn't matter what I want. Look, this job is gonna get me out of debt. So I'm gonna do the grown-up thing and see it through.",9,Big Bang Theory,127,26
47363,Leonard,20," Well, that is the grown-up thing.",9,Big Bang Theory,34,6
47364,Penny,20, I guess.,9,Big Bang Theory,9,2
47365,Leonard,20, I love you.,9,Big Bang Theory,12,3
47366,Penny,20," I love you, too.",9,Big Bang Theory,17,4
47367,Leonard,20," You know, never have I ever made love in the forest while it was raining.",9,Big Bang Theory,74,15
47368,Penny,20," Well, guess I gotta drink.",9,Big Bang Theory,27,5
47370,Howard,20," All right, here we go.",9,Big Bang Theory,23,5
47372,Howard,20," Well, give me a second.",9,Big Bang Theory,24,5
47373,Raj,20, Are you sure you can do this?,9,Big Bang Theory,30,7
47374,Howard,20," Hey, who found four dollars and change on the beach with his metal detector?",9,Big Bang Theory,77,14
47375,Raj,20," I buried it there, so we could go home.",9,Big Bang Theory,40,9
47377,Raj,20, Wow.,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
47379,Raj,20, You guys made a person.,9,Big Bang Theory,24,5
47380,Howard,20, We did.,9,Big Bang Theory,8,2
47381,Raj,20, And I like to think I helped.,9,Big Bang Theory,30,7
47382,Howard,20, You didn't.,9,Big Bang Theory,12,2
47384,Sheldon,20," Oh, never have I ever drunk milk past its expiration date.",9,Big Bang Theory,59,11
47385,Amy,20, Never have I ever cancelled a dentist appointment.,9,Big Bang Theory,51,8
47386,Sheldon,20," Oh, uh, never have I ever put my foot in the ocean.",9,Big Bang Theory,52,12
47387,Amy,20, Never have I ever honked if I liked anything.,9,Big Bang Theory,46,9
47388,Sheldon,20," Oh, uh, never have I ever thrown, caught or touched a Frisbee.",9,Big Bang Theory,63,12
47389,Amy,20, Never have I ever put salt on my food without trying it first.,9,Big Bang Theory,63,13
47390,Sheldon,20, Oh. Never have I ever pushed all the buttons in an elevator.,9,Big Bang Theory,61,12
47391,Amy,20," Well, we all have a past.",9,Big Bang Theory,26,6
47393,Sheldon,21," I have a question about Batman. Batman is a man who dresses up like a bat. Man-bat is a part man, part bat hybrid. Now, if Man-Bat dressed up as a man to fight crime, would he be Man-Batman?",9,Big Bang Theory,191,39
47394,Leonard,21," No, he'd be Bat-Man-Bat.",9,Big Bang Theory,25,4
47395,Raj,21, But wouldn't Man-Batman just be a Batman that was bitten by a radioactive man?,9,Big Bang Theory,79,14
47396,Howard,21, But Batman is a man. You're talking about a man who would have the powers of a man. That's just Man-Man.,9,Big Bang Theory,105,21
47397,Sheldon,21," Well, isn't Man-Man just Man?",9,Big Bang Theory,30,5
47398,Leonard,21, But what if Man-Man dressed as a bat?,9,Big Bang Theory,38,8
47399,Raj,21," Well, that's just Batman.",9,Big Bang Theory,26,4
47400,Leonard,21," No, if a man dresses as a bat, that's Batman, but if Man-Man dresses as a bat, that's Batman-Man.",9,Big Bang Theory,98,19
47401,Howard,21, So does that answer your question?,9,Big Bang Theory,35,6
47402,Sheldon,21," Oh, I haven't asked it yet.",9,Big Bang Theory,28,6
47403,Raj,21," Oh, that's Claire. Got to run.",9,Big Bang Theory,31,6
47404,Leonard,21, I thought you were back with Emily.,9,Big Bang Theory,36,7
47405,Raj,21," Uh, actually I'm seeing both of them.",9,Big Bang Theory,38,7
47406,Leonard,21, You mean like through their window from behind a bush?,9,Big Bang Theory,55,10
47407,Raj,21," No, I'm actually dating two women. Later.",9,Big Bang Theory,42,7
47408,Leonard,21, Really? The guy who for years couldn't even talk to women is suddenly going out with two of them? How is that possible?,9,Big Bang Theory,120,23
47409,Howard,21," I know. Scientists have tried to reproduce it with computational models, but, in each case, the world blows up.",9,Big Bang Theory,112,19
47410,Leonard,21," Seriously, that guy's dating two women?",9,Big Bang Theory,40,6
47412,Sheldon,21," What, why did you get a party sub?",9,Big Bang Theory,35,8
47413,Leonard,21," People are coming over, it looked fun.",9,Big Bang Theory,39,7
47414,Sheldon,21," Well, we're only watching Game of Thrones. A party sub implies it's a party.",9,Big Bang Theory,77,14
47415,Leonard,21, Your attendance implies it's not.,9,Big Bang Theory,34,5
47416,Sheldon,21," I like a party as much as the next man, as long as the next man doesn't like a party. Oh, by the way, don't forget, tomorrow is our quarterly roommate agreement meeting.",9,Big Bang Theory,170,33
47417,Leonard,21," Oh, Sheldon, we don't need a meeting every three months.",9,Big Bang Theory,57,10
47418,Sheldon,21," Hmm? Well, it sounds like the kind of thing one would bring up at a quarterly roommate agreement meeting. Lucky for you it's tomorrow.",9,Big Bang Theory,135,24
47419,Leonard,21," Oh, you know what? I'm not going.",9,Big Bang Theory,34,7
47420,Sheldon,21," Well, you have to go. It's Penny's first time leading the Pledge of Allegiance.",9,Big Bang Theory,80,14
47421,Leonard,21, This meeting is a waste of time. Whether we make the switch from Post Raisin Bran to Kellogg's Raisin Bran should not require parliamentary procedure.,9,Big Bang Theory,151,25
47422,Sheldon,21, You realize one of them has sugar on the raisins.,9,Big Bang Theory,50,10
47423,Leonard,21, You're the only one who eats them.,9,Big Bang Theory,35,7
47424,Sheldon,21," And yet you get to weigh in. Democracy, it's pretty cool, isn't it?",9,Big Bang Theory,68,13
47425,Leonard,21," I'm not going, you can't make me.",9,Big Bang Theory,34,7
47426,Sheldon,21," Well, we'll just see about that.",9,Big Bang Theory,33,6
47427,Penny,21, What is the problem?,9,Big Bang Theory,21,4
47428,Sheldon,21, He says he's not coming to the roommate agreement meeting tomorrow.,9,Big Bang Theory,68,11
47429,Penny,21," Well, why the hell did I memorize the Pledge?",9,Big Bang Theory,46,9
47430,Leonard,21, You have fun. I will not be attending.,9,Big Bang Theory,39,8
47431,Sheldon,21," Oh, fine. We don't have to have a roommate agreement meeting if you don't want to.",9,Big Bang Theory,83,16
47432,Leonard,21, Thank you.,9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
47433,Sheldon,21," Of course, it will require a vote. Unfortunately, my official gavel is in my bedroom, but luckily, I have my travel gavel.",9,Big Bang Theory,123,22
47434,Leonard,21, You're being ridiculous.,9,Big Bang Theory,25,3
47435,Sheldon,21," There's a motion on the floor, I'm ridiculous. Do we have a second? Hmm? Hmm? There is no second. The motion is denied. Next time, make sure you have the votes first. That was embarrassing.",9,Big Bang Theory,190,35
47436,Leonard,21, Can you please talk to him?,9,Big Bang Theory,28,6
47437,Penny,21," Well, why are you fighting him on this?",9,Big Bang Theory,40,8
47438,Leonard,21," Because I am tired of him always getting his way. We don't need a stupid meeting. We don't even need a roommate agreement, and I hope that sandwich does cause a party.",9,Big Bang Theory,168,32
47439,Penny,21," Well, I will still come to your meeting.",9,Big Bang Theory,41,8
47440,Sheldon,21," Well, I should hope so. Tomorrow's picture day.",9,Big Bang Theory,48,8
47441,Leonard,21, Why are you taking his side?,9,Big Bang Theory,29,6
47442,Penny,21," Because it's important to him, and when we signed the roommate agreement, we made a deal.",9,Big Bang Theory,90,16
47443,Sheldon,21," You keep talking like that, you're gonna make colour guard.",9,Big Bang Theory,60,10
47445,Raj,21," Man, I'm worn out.",9,Big Bang Theory,19,4
47446,Howard,21, I know. Imagine if we were actually moving.,9,Big Bang Theory,44,8
47447,Raj,21," No, it's just, ever since I started dating Claire and Emily at the same time, it's exhausting.",9,Big Bang Theory,95,17
47448,Howard,21, You're exhausted? Try folding every five pages in a pregnancy book so your wife thinks you read it.,9,Big Bang Theory,100,18
47449,Raj,21," But, dude, you're so lucky. Getting to stay home at night with the woman you love.",9,Big Bang Theory,83,16
47450,Howard,21, I guess I am lucky.,9,Big Bang Theory,20,5
47451,Raj,21," You are, because dating two women, I mean, I can't even remember the last time I slept in my own apartment. I wake up and I'm like, am I at Claire's or am I at Emily's? Is there a third girl I've forgotten about? Like, where am I?",9,Big Bang Theory,231,48
47453,Raj,21," Hey, how's the mommy-to-be?",9,Big Bang Theory,28,4
47455,Raj,21, I feel you. I've been dating multiple women.,9,Big Bang Theory,45,8
47456,Howard,21, You sure you don't want to come watch Game of Thrones with us?,9,Big Bang Theory,63,13
47458,Raj,21," Oh, that sounds great, a bed to yourself. Can't even remember what that's like.",9,Big Bang Theory,80,14
47460,Sheldon,21, Are you up-to-date on Game of Thrones?,9,Big Bang Theory,39,7
47461,Penny,21," Mm, I think so. Dragons, snow zombies, and all the hot guys are dead.",9,Big Bang Theory,70,14
47462,Sheldon,21," Oh, I don't know. Theon Greyjoy looks pretty good for a guy who had his genitals cut off.",9,Big Bang Theory,90,18
47463,Penny,21," Uh-oh, somebody's still pouting.",9,Big Bang Theory,33,4
47464,Leonard,21, Leave me alone.,9,Big Bang Theory,16,3
47465,Penny,21," If it's because you lost a stick, I know where it went.",9,Big Bang Theory,56,12
47466,Leonard,21, Not funny.,9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
47467,Penny,21, You know you're gonna make up with him. Can we just skip to that part?,9,Big Bang Theory,71,15
47468,Leonard,21," Oh, of course, because I'm the only adult around here.",9,Big Bang Theory,55,10
47469,Penny,21, Really? The only adult?,9,Big Bang Theory,24,4
47470,Leonard,21," Yeah, that's right.",9,Big Bang Theory,20,3
47471,Sheldon,21," Tonight I'll be watching a show rated M.A., and that stands for mature audiences, buster.",9,Big Bang Theory,90,15
47472,Penny,21," All right, you would think the only adult wouldn't let something silly ruin our entire night.",9,Big Bang Theory,94,16
47473,Leonard,21, And I'd think you'd understand why I'm annoyed.,9,Big Bang Theory,48,8
47474,Sheldon,21, All this could be avoided if you'd just come to the meeting.,9,Big Bang Theory,61,12
47475,Leonard,21, I don't want to.,9,Big Bang Theory,17,4
47476,Sheldon,21," Oh, it's just a meeting. One simple meeting.",9,Big Bang Theory,45,8
47477,Leonard,21, Stop saying meeting.,9,Big Bang Theory,21,3
47478,Sheldon,21," Meeting, meeting, bo-beeting, banana-fana, fo-feeting, fee-fi mo-meeting.",9,Big Bang Theory,74,7
47479,Amy,21, I brought my famous spinach dip.,9,Big Bang Theory,33,6
47480,Sheldon,21," Yeah, Amy, just one second. Meeting.",9,Big Bang Theory,37,6
47482,Howard,21," I'm not sure if I'm hoping for a boy or a girl. I mean, if it's a boy, I'm gonna have to teach him to play catch. Which means I'm gonna have to google how to play catch. If it's a girl, I mean, they're so innocent and you know how guys are.",9,Big Bang Theory,241,53
47483,Raj,21," Totally, guys are the worst. I mean, look at me. I let Emily make me a frittata and I kept the leftovers in Claire's fridge that night. I'm such a dog.",9,Big Bang Theory,152,31
47484,Howard,21, There you go again.,9,Big Bang Theory,20,4
47485,Raj,21," I'm sorry, have I been complaining about it too much?",9,Big Bang Theory,54,10
47486,Howard,21," Actually, what you're doing is pretending to complain, but really trying to brag.",9,Big Bang Theory,82,13
47487,Raj,21, How could you say that?,9,Big Bang Theory,24,5
47488,Howard,21," Oh, I wish could enjoy a cup of tea without a naked girl bouncing up and down on me.",9,Big Bang Theory,85,19
47489,Raj,21, I never said that.,9,Big Bang Theory,19,4
47490,Howard,21, Don't you hate it when you can't remember whose bra it is you found wedged in your couch?,9,Big Bang Theory,90,18
47491,Raj,21," Okay, that I said. But that's a real problem. You give a girl another woman's bra, and you will not be having sex with her that night. Maybe the other girl, but not her.",9,Big Bang Theory,170,34
47493,Amy,21, What's going on with him?,9,Big Bang Theory,26,5
47494,Penny,21," Oh, he's all bent out of shape about having a roommate agreement meeting.",9,Big Bang Theory,74,13
47495,Sheldon,21," Apparently, perfect attendance isn't cool any more.",9,Big Bang Theory,52,7
47496,Penny,21," Don't worry, he'll come around.",9,Big Bang Theory,32,5
47497,Amy,21," Well, I get why he's annoyed.",9,Big Bang Theory,30,6
47498,Sheldon,21," Well, then you don't understand what's happening. See, Leonard refused to participate in a mandatory quarterly roommate agreement meeting. This is what a generation raised on Bart Simpson looks like.",9,Big Bang Theory,200,30
47499,Leonard,21, You love The Simpsons.,9,Big Bang Theory,23,4
47500,Sheldon,21, I love Lisa Simpson.,9,Big Bang Theory,21,4
47501,Amy,21," Well, I know how he feels. I never enjoyed our relationship agreement meetings.",9,Big Bang Theory,80,13
47502,Sheldon,21, Wait. You were pretending?,9,Big Bang Theory,27,4
47503,Amy,21, Sorry.,9,Big Bang Theory,7,1
47504,Sheldon,21, No. I don't believe you. I could tell.,9,Big Bang Theory,39,8
47505,Amy,21," Oh, Sheldon, I never thought re-filing a matter in a standing subcommittee could be so fascinating.",9,Big Bang Theory,100,16
47506,Sheldon,21," Hmm, what do you think?",9,Big Bang Theory,24,5
47507,Penny,21, You don't know?,9,Big Bang Theory,16,3
47509,Raj,21," Hey, did I say something to upset you?",9,Big Bang Theory,39,8
47510,Howard,21," No, I'm fine.",9,Big Bang Theory,14,3
47511,Raj,21," Really? Because usually we walk side by side, and I just went up two flights of stairs staring at your bottom.",9,Big Bang Theory,111,21
47512,Howard,21, Just drop it.,9,Big Bang Theory,14,3
47513,Raj,21," Okay, I think I see what's happening here. You're jealous of me.",9,Big Bang Theory,65,12
47514,Howard,21," Oh, please. What could you possibly have that I would be jealous of?",9,Big Bang Theory,69,13
47515,Raj,21," It's not what I have, it's how many people I'm having it with.",9,Big Bang Theory,63,13
47516,Penny,21," Come on, Sheldon, we'll watch Game of Thrones over here.",9,Big Bang Theory,57,10
47517,Sheldon,21, Gladly.,9,Big Bang Theory,8,1
47518,Leonard,21," Oh, good, go. You know, it'll be nice to watch an episode without someone saying, I read the books, don't get too fond of this character.",9,Big Bang Theory,138,26
47519,Sheldon,21," It's not always because they die. In one case, it's because they've become involved with underground tree people from the dawn of time. Yeah, but I won't say who it is. It's Brann.",9,Big Bang Theory,181,33
47520,Howard,21," Wait, what is going on?",9,Big Bang Theory,24,5
47521,Penny,21," Leonard's being a jerk, so we're gonna watch over here.",9,Big Bang Theory,56,10
47522,Amy,21, Do you guys want to watch with us?,9,Big Bang Theory,35,8
47523,Howard,21, As long as I don't have to watch with him.,9,Big Bang Theory,43,10
47524,Raj,21," Fine, I don't want to watch with you either. I'll go over here.",9,Big Bang Theory,64,13
47525,Howard,21, Why do you get to pick?,9,Big Bang Theory,24,6
47526,Raj,21," Okay, then you go there.",9,Big Bang Theory,25,5
47527,Howard,21, Don't tell me where to go.,9,Big Bang Theory,27,6
47528,Leonard,21," Howard, just come in here.",9,Big Bang Theory,27,5
47529,Penny,21," Yeah, come on, Raj.",9,Big Bang Theory,20,4
47530,Raj,21," Wait, did Amy make her spinach dip?",9,Big Bang Theory,36,7
47531,Sheldon,21, She did.,9,Big Bang Theory,9,2
47532,Howard,21, And I'm gonna eat it all.,9,Big Bang Theory,26,6
47534,Howard,21, So what the hell happened?,9,Big Bang Theory,27,5
47535,Leonard,21," Oh, I just ran out of patience with Sheldon's nonsense.",9,Big Bang Theory,56,10
47536,Howard,21," Tell me about it. I've had it with Raj, too.",9,Big Bang Theory,45,10
47537,Amy,21," You know, like women, men have a monthly hormone cycle. Dips in testosterone can cause irritability.",9,Big Bang Theory,101,16
47538,Howard,21, Interesting. Maybe my male cycle synced up with Raj's actual period.,9,Big Bang Theory,69,11
47539,Leonard,21," If Sheldon's testosterone dipped, he'd become a butterfly.  Oh. Maybe someone's here to apologize.",9,Big Bang Theory,99,14
47541,Leonard,21, Stuart.,9,Big Bang Theory,8,1
47543,Leonard,21, No.,9,Big Bang Theory,4,1
47545,Leonard,21, No.,9,Big Bang Theory,4,1
47547,Howard,21, Yeah.,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
47550,Penny,21, May I take your cloak?,9,Big Bang Theory,23,5
47552,Sheldon,21," Well, I'll catch you up. Uh, Penny is angry at Leonard, Leonard's angry at me and Penny, I'm angry at Leonard and Amy, Raj is angry at Howard, and I'm angry at George R.R. Martin 'cause there are no new books for me to spoil for Leonard.",9,Big Bang Theory,238,47
47554,Raj,21," Says I was talking too much about dating Claire and Emily, and I accused him of being jealous.",9,Big Bang Theory,95,18
47557,Leonard,21," I don't know how you put up with it. He's impossible. I mean, holding a meeting to decide what breakfast cereal we should buy.",9,Big Bang Theory,127,24
47558,Howard,21," Yeah. Cap'n Crunch with Crunch Berries, move on.",9,Big Bang Theory,49,8
47559,Leonard,21," Anyway, Amy, thank you for sticking up for me.",9,Big Bang Theory,47,9
47560,Amy,21," Oh, I honestly couldn't care less.",9,Big Bang Theory,35,6
47561,Leonard,21, Sorry?,9,Big Bang Theory,7,1
47562,Amy,21," Well, I just took your side 'cause sometimes I get annoyed at how close Sheldon and Penny are.",9,Big Bang Theory,95,18
47563,Leonard,21," Well, they argue all the time. They aren't that close.",9,Big Bang Theory,55,10
47564,Amy,21, Who's always comforting him when he's upset?,9,Big Bang Theory,45,7
47565,Leonard,21," Penny, but",9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
47566,Amy,21, Who's the only one who can make him take his medicine when he's sick?,9,Big Bang Theory,70,14
47567,Leonard,21," I try to hide it in his peanut butter, but he spits it out.",9,Big Bang Theory,60,14
47568,Amy,21, Okay. And did you know she has him add things to the roommate agreement so she can get her way and not fight with you about it?,9,Big Bang Theory,128,27
47569,Leonard,21, Son of a bitch. Why is that funny?,9,Big Bang Theory,35,8
47570,Howard,21, I don't know. I like the pain of others.,9,Big Bang Theory,41,9
47571,Leonard,21," Oh, well, then you'll enjoy this. Bernadette does the same thing with you and Koothrappali.",9,Big Bang Theory,92,15
47572,Howard,21," No, she doesn't.",9,Big Bang Theory,17,3
47573,Leonard,21, She defends him all the time.,9,Big Bang Theory,30,6
47574,Howard,21, She does not.,9,Big Bang Theory,14,3
47575,Amy,21, Who told you to stop making all those Gandhi jokes about him?,9,Big Bang Theory,62,12
47576,Howard,21," Well, she did. And human resources.",9,Big Bang Theory,36,6
47577,Leonard,21, Who do you think told Koothrappali to go to human resources?,9,Big Bang Theory,61,11
47578,Howard,21, Son of a bitch.,9,Big Bang Theory,16,4
47579,Leonard,21," You're, you're right, it feels good.",9,Big Bang Theory,37,6
47581,Raj,21," All right, it's almost game time. Get it? Game of Thrones, game time?",9,Big Bang Theory,70,13
47583,Sheldon,21," Oh, perhaps it's Amy coming to her senses.",9,Big Bang Theory,43,8
47584,Penny,21, What's up?,9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
47585,Leonard,21," You know, you don't need to use Sheldon to get your way with me in a dumb roommate agreement.",9,Big Bang Theory,94,19
47586,Penny,21, Where'd you get that from?,9,Big Bang Theory,27,5
47587,Leonard,21, From Amy.,9,Big Bang Theory,10,2
47588,Penny,21," Ugh. Amy, why did you tell him that?",9,Big Bang Theory,37,8
47589,Amy,21, Because you were defending Sheldon like you always do.,9,Big Bang Theory,55,9
47590,Penny,21, I don't always defend Sheldon.,9,Big Bang Theory,31,5
47591,Leonard,21," Oh, yes, you do. You know you have a weird brother-sister-Elliott-E.T. relationship with him.",9,Big Bang Theory,94,14
47592,Penny,21, What about your weird relationship with him?,9,Big Bang Theory,45,7
47593,Leonard,21, That's different. I'm like the little girl in Poltergeist and he's the creepy thing in the TV.,9,Big Bang Theory,95,17
47594,Howard,21," Um, guys? Were there any nuts in that food?",9,Big Bang Theory,44,9
47595,Leonard,21, I don't think so. Why?,9,Big Bang Theory,23,5
47596,Howard,21, Well just a feeling.,9,Big Bang Theory,21,4
47598,Leonard,21, It just said Italian sub. I had no idea mortadella has pistachios in it.,9,Big Bang Theory,73,14
47599,Sheldon,21," Interesting fact, in Italian, the morta in mortadella means death.",9,Big Bang Theory,67,10
47600,Amy,21, Sheldon.,9,Big Bang Theory,9,1
47601,Sheldon,21, I didn't say fun fact. I'm not a monster.,9,Big Bang Theory,42,9
47603,Sheldon,21, Now it's a fun fact.,9,Big Bang Theory,21,5
47609,Raj,21," You know, if you think about it, tonight was kind of like a real-life Game of Thrones.",9,Big Bang Theory,87,17
47610,Amy,21, How?,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
47611,Raj,21," Well, Howard eating that pistachio was like when King Joffrey got poisoned.",9,Big Bang Theory,76,12
47612,Penny,21," Okay, well, that was murder, this was an accident.",9,Big Bang Theory,51,9
47613,Raj,21, Okay. But you using Sheldon to do your dirty work is like when Cersei used the King's Guard to do her bidding.,9,Big Bang Theory,111,22
47614,Sheldon,21, Cersei uses her body to manipulate men. Penny just takes me to The LEGO Store.,9,Big Bang Theory,79,15
47615,Raj,21," Okay. Oh, how about this? Stuart's dressed like a brother of the Night's Watch, and they don't have sex.",9,Big Bang Theory,105,19
47616,Penny,21, There you go.,9,Big Bang Theory,14,3
47617,Leonard,21, That's true.,9,Big Bang Theory,13,2
47618,Sheldon,21, Fair enough.,9,Big Bang Theory,13,2
47619,Howard,21, Hey.,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
47620,Leonard,21, Hey.,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
47622,Howard,21, I'm fine. Just a little embarrassed I had to be carried down the stairs like a baby. Thanks.,9,Big Bang Theory,93,18
47623,Leonard,21, Let's get out of here.,9,Big Bang Theory,23,5
47624,Amy,21, That was scary.,9,Big Bang Theory,16,3
47625,Sheldon,21," Well, the important thing is I said that big sandwich would ruin everything, and I was right.",9,Big Bang Theory,94,17
47627,Raj,21," Hey, Jon Snow. How come your horse has a basket on it?",9,Big Bang Theory,55,12
47629,Sheldon,21," They don't wear bicycle helmets in Game of Thrones. You're thematically inaccurate, but I applaud your commitment to safety.",9,Big Bang Theory,125,19
47631,Leonard,21, Better than watching a guy in a fur cloak ride a girl's bike? Nope.,9,Big Bang Theory,68,14
47634,Sheldon,21,  Leonard.  Leonard.  Leonard.,9,Big Bang Theory,30,3
47635,Leonard,21, What?,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
47636,Sheldon,21, I never got to ask my question about Batman.,9,Big Bang Theory,45,9
47637,Leonard,21, What is it?,9,Big Bang Theory,12,3
47638,Sheldon,21," If Batman were bitten by a radioactive Man-Bat, and then fought crime disguised as Man-Bat, would he be Man-Bat-Man-Bat-Man or simply Man-Bat-Man-Bat-Batman?",9,Big Bang Theory,158,22
47639,Penny,21, Is he still wearing the Batman suit under the Man-Bat suit?,9,Big Bang Theory,60,11
47640,Sheldon,21, I'll be back.,9,Big Bang Theory,14,3
47642,Penny,22," Oh, hey, if you guys are free this weekend, I won a night of wine tasting from work.",9,Big Bang Theory,85,18
47643,Leonard,22, That sounds fun.,9,Big Bang Theory,17,3
47644,Penny,22, Mm-hmm.,9,Big Bang Theory,8,1
47645,Leonard,22, How come scientists don't win free stuff like salespeople do?,9,Big Bang Theory,62,10
47646,Howard,22, â€˜Cause we're not in it for the stuff. We're in it for the groupies.,9,Big Bang Theory,70,14
47647,Sheldon,22," Personally, I find the notion of external rewards demeaning. I pursue science for the intrinsic joy of discovery.",9,Big Bang Theory,114,18
47648,Amy,22, But you always say that you want to win a Nobel Prize.,9,Big Bang Theory,55,12
47649,Sheldon,22," I also say don't contradict me in front of my friends, but that you don't remember.",9,Big Bang Theory,84,16
47650,Penny,22," All right, well, let me know if you guys want to go.",9,Big Bang Theory,53,12
47651,Raj,22, I would love to. I do enjoy the complexity of an aged Pinot noir.,9,Big Bang Theory,66,14
47652,Leonard,22, I'm sure that would pair nicely with your fried nuggets of chicken.,9,Big Bang Theory,68,12
47653,Amy,22," Well, it sounds like a nice night. We should go.",9,Big Bang Theory,49,10
47654,Sheldon,22," Wine again? Yeah, no, thank you. I like my grapes the old-fashioned way, in a juice box.",9,Big Bang Theory,89,17
47655,Amy,22," Well, I'm going. You couldn't stop me from getting a massage at the mall, and you're not stopping me now.",9,Big Bang Theory,106,20
47656,Sheldon,22, I shouldn't have to see my girlfriend get groped in public by another man.,9,Big Bang Theory,75,14
47657,Amy,22, And I shouldn't have to see my boyfriend riding on a train for children around the mall.,9,Big Bang Theory,89,17
47658,Penny,22, The little choo-choo for toddlers?,9,Big Bang Theory,35,5
47659,Amy,22, And now you know why I needed the massage.,9,Big Bang Theory,43,9
47660,Howard,22," Well, we're out. Bernie can't drink 'cause she's pregnant. And she's pregnant because we had sex. And we had sex because, well, come on.",9,Big Bang Theory,137,24
47662,Howard,22, You sure?,9,Big Bang Theory,10,2
47664,Penny,22," Yeah, give her a break from, well, come on.",9,Big Bang Theory,44,9
47665,Sheldon,22," Well, Bernadette, looks like Saturday night, it's you and me.",9,Big Bang Theory,62,10
47667,Sheldon,22," Well, it makes perfect sense. Because you're an expectant mother, you can't drink alcohol. I don't like to. You can't have sushi. I don't like to. You can't go in hot tubs. I consider them vats of sweaty people soup.",9,Big Bang Theory,217,40
47669,Sheldon,22," Oh, come on. Roller coasters, caffeine, runny eggs, I've been avoiding these things all my life. And now, because you're pregnant, you have to.",9,Big Bang Theory,144,24
47670,Leonard,22," The difference is she's bringing life into the world, and you suck it out.",9,Big Bang Theory,75,14
47672,Sheldon,22," Well, little lady, you've heard of party hearty, get ready to party hardly.",9,Big Bang Theory,76,13
47673,Howard,22, I bet you'd like a drink right now.,9,Big Bang Theory,36,8
47675,Raj,22," Hey, you think it'd be okay if I brought Claire to the wine tasting?",9,Big Bang Theory,69,14
47676,Leonard,22, Sure. I'd like to meet her.,9,Big Bang Theory,28,6
47677,Raj,22," Oh, that's great. I've been wanting her to meet you guys, too, so this seems like the perfect opportunity.",9,Big Bang Theory,107,19
47678,Sheldon,22," Oh, but I won't be there.",9,Big Bang Theory,26,6
47679,Raj,22, Funny how that worked out.,9,Big Bang Theory,27,5
47680,Leonard,22, Does this mean Emily's not in the picture anymore?,9,Big Bang Theory,51,9
47681,Raj,22," No, I'm still dating her.",9,Big Bang Theory,26,5
47682,Leonard,22," Okay, help me out. How are you doing this? Do they know about each other?",9,Big Bang Theory,74,15
47683,Raj,22," They know that we're not exclusive, and we just don't ask too many questions.",9,Big Bang Theory,78,14
47684,Sheldon,22," You know, it's like how I play Warlords of Ka'a with you and Elder Sign with Frank and Alicia.",9,Big Bang Theory,95,19
47685,Leonard,22, Who's Frank and Alicia?,9,Big Bang Theory,24,4
47686,Sheldon,22," You, you and I spend a lot of time together. Can there be a little mystery between us?",9,Big Bang Theory,87,18
47687,Howard,22, Okay. Everything's hooked up. We're ready.,9,Big Bang Theory,43,6
47688,Sheldon,22, I am going to record this for posterity.,9,Big Bang Theory,41,8
47689,Leonard,22," All right, here goes nothing.",9,Big Bang Theory,30,5
47690,Sheldon,22, Here goes nothing? This is the initial test of our prototype. Can we give it a little more gravitas?,9,Big Bang Theory,101,19
47691,Leonard,22," Fine. Preliminary trial of the infinite persistence gyroscopic navigational system, phase one commencing.",9,Big Bang Theory,106,13
47692,Sheldon,22," Eh, maybe it's your voice. I'm gonna see if I can get James Earl Jones to do it in post.",9,Big Bang Theory,89,20
47693,Raj,22," It's, it's beautiful.",9,Big Bang Theory,22,3
47694,Howard,22," Actually, it's making me dizzy.",9,Big Bang Theory,32,5
47695,Leonard,22," Good, it's not just me.",9,Big Bang Theory,24,5
47698,Raj,22," Hey, Claire.",9,Big Bang Theory,13,2
47700,Raj,22," Hi, yeah. Um, I was wondering, if you're free Saturday night, all my friends are going to a wine tasting.",9,Big Bang Theory,106,20
47702,Raj,22, Why would it be too big a step?,9,Big Bang Theory,32,8
47704,Raj,22," Nothing to worry about. People meet people all the time, and it isn't weird. I met Bon Jovi once, which you'd think might be weird. Turns out, total sweetheart.",9,Big Bang Theory,161,29
47706,Raj,22," Boy, it wasn't this hard with Bon Jovi. I said you rock, he said, thanks, man, and that was that.",9,Big Bang Theory,98,20
47708,Penny,22," Hey, you ready to go?",9,Big Bang Theory,22,5
47709,Leonard,22, Hang on.,9,Big Bang Theory,9,2
47710,Penny,22, What are you doing?,9,Big Bang Theory,20,4
47711,Leonard,22," Oh, I found a scratch-and-sniff book about wine tasting. It teaches the different flavour notes to look for.",9,Big Bang Theory,109,18
47712,Penny,22, You actually smell the wine?,9,Big Bang Theory,29,5
47713,Leonard,22, I mostly just smell my nasal spray.,9,Big Bang Theory,36,7
47714,Penny,22, Are your sinuses acting up?,9,Big Bang Theory,28,5
47715,Leonard,22, Since my preschool got a bunny.,9,Big Bang Theory,32,6
47716,Penny,22," Hey, are you still hanging out with Bernadette tonight?",9,Big Bang Theory,56,9
47717,Sheldon,22, Yes. And we're going to prove that we don't need alcohol to enjoy ourselves.,9,Big Bang Theory,77,14
47718,Penny,22," Oh, good for you.",9,Big Bang Theory,18,4
47719,Sheldon,22," Or caffeine, tobacco, sushi, soft cheese, processed meats and jacuzzis, which can all be harmful to an unborn baby.",9,Big Bang Theory,116,19
47720,Penny,22," No honey baked ham in a hot tub, got it.",9,Big Bang Theory,41,10
47721,Sheldon,22," Oh, no bubble baths either. They can increase the risk of a urinary tract infection.",9,Big Bang Theory,85,15
47722,Leonard,22," Okay, have fun.",9,Big Bang Theory,16,3
47723,Sheldon,22," Oh, and no swordfish, king mackerel, shark or tilefish, which are all high in mercury.",9,Big Bang Theory,87,15
47724,Leonard,22, We're leaving now!,9,Big Bang Theory,19,3
47725,Sheldon,22," Oh, and no contact with guinea pigs or hamsters or their droppings, uh, no-no cat litter boxes, no paint fumes.",9,Big Bang Theory,112,20
47726,Penny,22," Okay, we're leaving, love you, bye.",9,Big Bang Theory,36,6
47727,Sheldon,22," Boy, do I love restrictions.",9,Big Bang Theory,29,5
47729,Howard,22, Hey. Where is everybody?,9,Big Bang Theory,25,4
47730,Amy,22," Oh, we're the first ones here.",9,Big Bang Theory,31,6
47731,Howard,22, Oh. Cool.,9,Big Bang Theory,10,2
47732,Amy,22, Yeah. Cool.,9,Big Bang Theory,12,2
47733,Howard,22," You know, I don't remember the last time it was just you and me hanging out.",9,Big Bang Theory,77,16
47734,Amy,22," Oh, I do. It was three years ago.",9,Big Bang Theory,34,8
47735,Howard,22," Oh, yeah, and we said we should do it more often. And, and, and, and, and here we are.",9,Big Bang Theory,87,19
47736,Amy,22," So, Sheldon and Bernadette are hanging out.",9,Big Bang Theory,44,7
47737,Howard,22, I know. What are they gonna talk about?,9,Big Bang Theory,40,8
47738,Amy,22, I don't know. I really don't know.,9,Big Bang Theory,35,7
47739,Leonard,22, Hey.,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
47740,Howard,22," Oh, good.",9,Big Bang Theory,10,2
47741,Amy,22," Oh, thank God.",9,Big Bang Theory,15,3
47742,Penny,22, You guys been here long?,9,Big Bang Theory,25,5
47743,Howard,22," No, two minutes.",9,Big Bang Theory,17,3
47744,Amy,22, But yes.,9,Big Bang Theory,9,2
47745,Howard,22, Where's Claire?,9,Big Bang Theory,16,2
47746,Raj,22," Oh, she's meeting us here. Hey, guys, do me a favour and don't ask too many questions about the relationship. We're just keeping it casual.",9,Big Bang Theory,140,25
47747,Leonard,22," Oh, so I shouldn't ask her how she feels about being a member of your harem?",9,Big Bang Theory,77,16
47748,Raj,22," Yeah, I know you're teasing, but watch out for karma.",9,Big Bang Theory,54,10
47749,Amy,22," Hey, Penny, isn't that your old boyfriend Zack?",9,Big Bang Theory,48,8
47750,Penny,22," Oh, yeah.",9,Big Bang Theory,10,2
47751,Amy,22, Are you gonna say hi to him?,9,Big Bang Theory,29,7
47752,Penny,22," Uh, I don't know.",9,Big Bang Theory,18,4
47753,Raj,22," Hey, while you decide, who was better in bed, big hot Zack or wheezy little Leonard? Neener neener.",9,Big Bang Theory,100,18
47756,Sheldon,22," Oh, the bubbles tickle my nose. I'll just open this now so it can get nice and flat before we drink it.",9,Big Bang Theory,104,22
47758,Sheldon,22," Oh, I have quite the evening planned. Our foetus-friendly festival of fun begins with an in-depth look at the world of model trains, and then we'll kick things up a notch and explore all the different ways that you can make toast.",9,Big Bang Theory,231,42
47760,Sheldon,22, You've heard of French toast?,9,Big Bang Theory,30,5
47762,Sheldon,22, Cinnamon toast?,9,Big Bang Theory,16,2
47764,Sheldon,22, Melba toast?,9,Big Bang Theory,13,2
47766,Sheldon,22, You get where I'm going here?,9,Big Bang Theory,30,6
47769,Amy,22, I'm getting an earthy note.,9,Big Bang Theory,28,5
47770,Penny,22," Ah, there's definitely some oak.",9,Big Bang Theory,33,5
47771,Raj,22," Also, uh, cherries?",9,Big Bang Theory,20,3
47772,Leonard,22, I smell nothing.,9,Big Bang Theory,17,3
47773,Howard,22, Really? Nothing?,9,Big Bang Theory,17,2
47774,Leonard,22, Just a whole lot of Afrin.,9,Big Bang Theory,27,6
47776,Penny,22," Oh. Zack, hi. You guys remember Zack.",9,Big Bang Theory,38,7
47777,Howard,22," Yeah, hey, buddy.",9,Big Bang Theory,18,3
47778,Amy,22, Hello.,9,Big Bang Theory,7,1
47779,Raj,22, Hey.,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
47781,Penny,22, We did.,9,Big Bang Theory,8,2
47782,Leonard,22," Yeah, mm-hmm.",9,Big Bang Theory,14,2
47784,Penny,22, Yes.,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
47786,Leonard,22, Thanks.,9,Big Bang Theory,8,1
47788,Howard,22, We've actually been working on a prototype for a navigation system we invented.,9,Big Bang Theory,80,13
47789,Leonard,22, But we won't bore you with the details.,9,Big Bang Theory,40,8
47791,Amy,22, Mike deGrasse Tyson?,9,Big Bang Theory,21,3
47792,Howard,22," Yeah, you know, the boxer who grew a moustache and became a scientist.",9,Big Bang Theory,71,13
47794,Howard,22," Well, we're using quantum vortices to replace gyroscopes in guidance systems.",9,Big Bang Theory,78,11
47795,Leonard,22, What's neat is that they can maintain angular momentum indefinitely.,9,Big Bang Theory,69,10
47797,Howard,22," You could put it in a satellite or a rocket, and it'll run forever.",9,Big Bang Theory,68,14
47799,Howard,22," Yeah, but we didn't create it for weapons.",9,Big Bang Theory,43,8
47800,Leonard,22, And I doubt the military would be interested in our little guidance system.,9,Big Bang Theory,76,13
47802,Howard,22, A lot.,9,Big Bang Theory,7,2
47803,Leonard,22, Way better.,9,Big Bang Theory,12,2
47806,Sheldon,22," H-O gauge trains are 1/87th scale. N gauge are 1/160th scale. And that brings us to Z gauge, at a, you could easily swallow it, don't ask how I know, 1 to 220.",9,Big Bang Theory,160,33
47808,Sheldon,22," When I was five, I ingested a Z gauge locomotive. I spent the next three days saying, I think I can pass it, I think I can pass it, I think I can pass it.",9,Big Bang Theory,155,35
47810,Sheldon,22," What an interesting question. When I was a child, life was confusing and chaotic for me, and trains represented order. I could line them up, categorize them, control them. I guess you could say that they gave me a sense of calm in a world that didn't.",9,Big Bang Theory,252,47
47812,Sheldon,22," Well, other than when they're chugging through your bowels, these things are magic.",9,Big Bang Theory,84,13
47814,Leonard,22," I have to admit, I've been worried about the military applications since we started talking about this.",9,Big Bang Theory,104,17
47815,Howard,22," Me, too.",9,Big Bang Theory,9,2
47816,Leonard,22, Why didn't you say something?,9,Big Bang Theory,30,5
47817,Howard,22, Same reason I don't talk about ass cancer. It's not a pleasant topic.,9,Big Bang Theory,70,13
47818,Raj,22, You can't let this stop you. Almost any scientific advancement can be used for destructive purposes.,9,Big Bang Theory,101,16
47819,Amy,22, It's true. Even Einstein's theory of relativity was later applied to the development of nuclear weapons.,9,Big Bang Theory,105,16
47820,Penny,22," E equals MC squared. Yeah. E is for energy, M for mass, and C for the speed of light.",9,Big Bang Theory,86,19
47821,Amy,22, How do you know that?,9,Big Bang Theory,22,5
47822,Penny,22," Oh, Leonard mumbles it when he wants sex to last longer.",9,Big Bang Theory,57,11
47824,Raj,22," Hey, Claire. Good, you're here. Guys, this is my friend Claire. We're casually dating, and there's no need for any further questions about it.",9,Big Bang Theory,143,24
47825,Leonard,22, Would you like a glass of wine?,9,Big Bang Theory,32,7
47826,Raj,22, I said no questions.,9,Big Bang Theory,21,4
47828,Sheldon,22," And last but not least, this is one that I like to call Star Wars Toast because it has a light side and a dark side. All righty, it's time for Dungeons & Dragons.",9,Big Bang Theory,163,34
47830,Sheldon,22, You're gonna enjoy this. I designed it especially for you.,9,Big Bang Theory,59,10
47832,Sheldon,22," Oh, I have a feeling that once you start, you're not gonna want to or be allowed to stop.",9,Big Bang Theory,90,19
47834,Sheldon,22, Ready?,9,Big Bang Theory,7,1
47836,Sheldon,22," Your name is Bernatrix. You are a warrior queen. You're strong, beautiful and tall.",9,Big Bang Theory,84,14
47838,Sheldon,22," I think you're gonna like a lot of things I have in store. For example, in this world, only the men get pregnant, so your husband is home trying not to pee when he laughs.",9,Big Bang Theory,172,35
47840,Sheldon,22," You're parched and weary from battle. You stand in front of a tavern that serves the coldest, most delicious ale in all the realm.",9,Big Bang Theory,131,24
47842,Sheldon,22, What do you do?,9,Big Bang Theory,16,4
47844,Sheldon,22, He wants to see I.D.,9,Big Bang Theory,21,5
47846,Amy,22," So, Claire, we've heard so many wonderful things about you.",9,Big Bang Theory,60,10
47848,Amy,22," Uh, mostly Penny's heard them.",9,Big Bang Theory,31,5
47850,Raj,22," Zack, this is my friend Claire.",9,Big Bang Theory,32,6
47852,Raj,22," Uh, she's seeing me.",9,Big Bang Theory,21,4
47854,Raj,22, We're just keeping it casual.,9,Big Bang Theory,30,5
47859,Leonard,22, Maybe we should take a step back.,9,Big Bang Theory,34,7
47860,Howard,22, Take a step back? I'm not a young man any more.,9,Big Bang Theory,48,11
47861,Leonard,22," No, I mean re-evaluate what we're doing with the guidance system.",9,Big Bang Theory,66,11
47862,Howard,22, But I got a baby on the way. I got to make some money.,9,Big Bang Theory,55,14
47863,Leonard,22, What good is money gonna do if we inadvertently bring about Armageddon?,9,Big Bang Theory,72,12
47864,Howard,22," Okay, let me stop you right there. We absolutely know our invention will not be used to destroy the world.",9,Big Bang Theory,107,20
47865,Leonard,22, How?,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
47866,Howard,22, Because no one from the future has come back to kill us.,9,Big Bang Theory,57,12
47867,Leonard,22, Very funny.,9,Big Bang Theory,12,2
47868,Howard,22, You got something better?,9,Big Bang Theory,26,4
47869,Leonard,22," Well, not really.",9,Big Bang Theory,18,3
47870,Howard,22," Okay, then. Geez, how much wine did you drink?",9,Big Bang Theory,47,9
47871,Leonard,22, Not a lot. I just couldn't start until you walked away.,9,Big Bang Theory,56,11
47873,Sheldon,22, The Hell Prawn lunges out of the hot spring. You block it with your shield. Do you attack?,9,Big Bang Theory,91,18
47875,Sheldon,22, Three giant red ones and they never blink. It's unsettling.,9,Big Bang Theory,60,10
47877,Sheldon,22," Good choice. Critical hit. Your sword goes through its eye into its tiny brain. With its final dying gasp, it says, you have reduced me to a pile of sushi. Enjoy me with this packet of soy sauce. It's low sodium. Aaaah.",9,Big Bang Theory,220,42
47879,Sheldon,22," Using your sword, you prepare a beautiful sushi dinner. You slip into the hot spring and enjoy the warm water on your aching joints. As you happily close your eyes, you recall the incredible evening you've had and notice that your feet and ankles are smaller than they've ever been. The end.",9,Big Bang Theory,292,52
47881,Sheldon,22," Oh, the fun doesn't stop. You're still going home with a goodie bag full of toast.",9,Big Bang Theory,83,16
47883,Sheldon,22," I can understand that. From the moment people realized I was a genius, I've been Sheldon the Genius. Although I've never really wanted a break from that, so I suppose I don't understand. Which is ironic 'cause, you know, genius.",9,Big Bang Theory,229,40
47885,Sheldon,22," You're welcome. And any time you need a break from being Bernadette the Pregnant, Bernatrix the Warrior Queen is here waiting.",9,Big Bang Theory,127,21
47887,Sheldon,22," Well, mind you now, that offer's only good until the third trimester. I can't risk getting amniotic fluid on my spot.",9,Big Bang Theory,118,21
47889,Raj,22," Hey, dude, you're killing me with Claire.",9,Big Bang Theory,42,7
47891,Raj,22," I mean, come on, look at you. You're classically handsome, you've got a swimmer's body. Next to you, I look like me.",9,Big Bang Theory,117,22
47893,Raj,22," Yeah, okay, just do me a favour and stop talking about how great Claire is.",9,Big Bang Theory,76,15
47896,Penny,22," Uh, you know, I'm not really around that much. Amy knows much more than I do.",9,Big Bang Theory,78,16
47897,Leonard,22," I don't think you have anything to worry about. Raj is a terrific guy, loyal to a fault.",9,Big Bang Theory,89,18
47898,Howard,22, Yeah. He still has an AOL address.,9,Big Bang Theory,35,7
47900,Raj,22," Don't listen to him. He says crazy things all the time. Uh, watch. Marco.",9,Big Bang Theory,74,14
47902,Raj,22," So, uh, what are you guys talking about?",9,Big Bang Theory,41,8
47904,Raj,22, Why would you do that? I specifically asked you not to do that.,9,Big Bang Theory,64,13
47905,Penny,22, We didn't.,9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
47906,Amy,22, You just did.,9,Big Bang Theory,14,3
47909,Leonard,22, Morning.,9,Big Bang Theory,9,1
47910,Sheldon,22, Morning.,9,Big Bang Theory,9,1
47911,Leonard,22, Ugh. Too much wine.,9,Big Bang Theory,20,4
47912,Sheldon,22," Oh, I overdid it myself last night. Hair of the dog.",9,Big Bang Theory,53,11
47913,Leonard,22," Hey, did you ever think about the military applications for the guidance system?",9,Big Bang Theory,81,13
47914,Sheldon,22, Of course.,9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
47915,Leonard,22, Does it bother you?,9,Big Bang Theory,20,4
47916,Sheldon,22," No, it did at first, but then I talked it through with Frank and Alicia, and they really helped put things into perspective.",9,Big Bang Theory,125,23
47917,Leonard,22, Who are these people?,9,Big Bang Theory,22,4
47918,Sheldon,22," Leonard, friends are like toilet paper. It's good to have extras under the sink.",9,Big Bang Theory,81,14
47920,Penny,23, Helium.,9,Big Bang Theory,8,1
47921,Sheldon,23, Yes.,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
47922,Penny,23, Yes.,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
47923,Sheldon,23, Taylor Swift.,9,Big Bang Theory,14,2
47924,Penny,23, Yes. Pi.,9,Big Bang Theory,9,2
47925,Sheldon,23, Yes. Kardashian.,9,Big Bang Theory,17,2
47926,Penny,23, More specific.,9,Big Bang Theory,15,2
47927,Sheldon,23, Khloe?,9,Big Bang Theory,7,1
47928,Penny,23, Yes.,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
47929,Sheldon,23," See, I remembered because if it looks like Kim it's Kim, if it looks kind of like Kim it's Kourtney, and if it looks nothing like Kim it's Khloe.",9,Big Bang Theory,146,29
47930,Penny,23," Oh, that's a Venn Diagram, and I remember because I thought to myself, venn is he gonna stop talking about this diagram?",9,Big Bang Theory,121,22
47931,Leonard,23, What are you guys doing?,9,Big Bang Theory,25,5
47932,Sheldon,23," Oh, well, we decided to use our breakfast time to expand our respective knowledge bases.",9,Big Bang Theory,89,15
47933,Leonard,23," Oh, let me try.",9,Big Bang Theory,16,4
47934,Penny,23, Okay.,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
47935,Leonard,23," Hmm, atom of hydrogen, Adam of Maroon 5, mic drop.",9,Big Bang Theory,51,10
47936,Sheldon,23," I'm sorry, who is Mike Drop?",9,Big Bang Theory,29,6
47937,Leonard,23," Oh, hey, Penny, do you want to go to the airport with me later to pick up my mother?",9,Big Bang Theory,85,19
47938,Penny,23, Sure.,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
47939,Leonard,23, Thanks.,9,Big Bang Theory,8,1
47940,Penny,23, No problem.,9,Big Bang Theory,12,2
47941,Leonard,23," Hey, Penny, um, since you're already gonna be at the airport, do I need to go?",9,Big Bang Theory,79,16
47942,Sheldon,23, Why don't you want to get your mother from the airport?,9,Big Bang Theory,56,11
47943,Leonard,23," Well, I can do without the 40-minute car ride where she criticizes every aspect of my life.",9,Big Bang Theory,92,17
47944,Sheldon,23, She can cover it in a car ride? I could do 40 minutes on your posture alone.,9,Big Bang Theory,77,17
47945,Penny,23, You really want me to pick up your mother all by myself?,9,Big Bang Theory,57,12
47946,Leonard,23," Hmm, I just feel like it would be a good chance for you to bond.",9,Big Bang Theory,65,15
47947,Penny,23, Or a way for you to avoid her?,9,Big Bang Theory,31,8
47948,Leonard,23," I don't know what he's putting on those cards, but you are smarter than ever.",9,Big Bang Theory,78,15
47949,Penny,23," Fine, if you really want me to, I will pick your mom up.",9,Big Bang Theory,57,13
47950,Leonard,23, Seriously?,9,Big Bang Theory,11,1
47951,Penny,23," Yeah, you know what, she is my mother-in-law, and I'd like for us to have a good relationship.",9,Big Bang Theory,95,18
47952,Leonard,23," That is very mature of you, so I'm gonna go ahead and say, suckah.",9,Big Bang Theory,67,14
47953,Sheldon,23," All right, back to learning.",9,Big Bang Theory,29,5
47954,Penny,23, Okay.,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
47955,Sheldon,23," Oh, easy, Bill Nye the Science Guy.",9,Big Bang Theory,36,7
47956,Penny,23, Or as I know him?,9,Big Bang Theory,18,5
47957,Sheldon,23, Creepy old dude from Dancing with the Stars.,9,Big Bang Theory,45,8
47958,Penny,23," Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.",9,Big Bang Theory,30,5
47960,Raj,23, Did you guys see there's an Avengers screening? Joss Whedon's gonna show some deleted scenes and do a question and answer session.,9,Big Bang Theory,131,22
47961,Sheldon,23," Oh, well, I have a few questions for him about the last Avengers movie, and a whole lot of answers.",9,Big Bang Theory,100,20
47962,Leonard,23, When's the screening?,9,Big Bang Theory,22,3
47963,Raj,23," Uh, it's tonight, but it's first-come, first-served, so we should probably get there early and wait in line.",9,Big Bang Theory,109,18
47964,Howard,23, Let's do it.,9,Big Bang Theory,13,3
47965,Leonard,23," Penny's busy with my mother, so I'm in.",9,Big Bang Theory,40,8
47966,Sheldon,23," Oh, bad news. Amy's making me go shopping with her later, so looks like none of us can go.",9,Big Bang Theory,91,19
47967,Leonard,23, You do realize we're allowed to have fun without you?,9,Big Bang Theory,54,10
47968,Howard,23," In fact, that's usually the trick to it. What time do we need to get there?",9,Big Bang Theory,76,16
47969,Raj,23," Uh, I'd say by three.",9,Big Bang Theory,22,5
47970,Sheldon,23, You're really going without me?,9,Big Bang Theory,32,5
47971,Leonard,23," It's not a big deal. Go shopping with Amy, and we'll save a spot in line for you.",9,Big Bang Theory,82,18
47972,Sheldon,23," You don't have the authority to save places in the line. If I do that, I'll be cutting.",9,Big Bang Theory,88,18
47973,Leonard,23, People do it all the time.,9,Big Bang Theory,27,6
47974,Sheldon,23," You know the golden rule of line etiquette. No cuts, no buts, no coconuts.",9,Big Bang Theory,75,14
47975,Howard,23," If you really care that much, there are apps now that'll let you hire people to do stuff like errands and wait in lines.",9,Big Bang Theory,121,24
47977,Howard,23, Some of these guys make over $20 an hour.,9,Big Bang Theory,42,9
47981,Penny,23," Wow. Didn't even make it out of the parking lot. Uh, you know what, enough about Leonard. Let's talk about you. What would you like to do while you're here?",9,Big Bang Theory,157,30
47983,Penny,23," Well, I'd actually like for us to be close, but maybe we start with our favourite books and work our way up to my husband's sex organs.",9,Big Bang Theory,136,27
47985,Penny,23," Um, does Pottery Barn, Spring count?",9,Big Bang Theory,37,6
47987,Penny,23," Uh, for starters, maybe you can not psychoanalyze everything I say?",9,Big Bang Theory,68,11
47989,Penny,23, Uncomfortable.,9,Big Bang Theory,15,1
47991,Penny,23," Oh. Sorry. Didn't know you made those. Hey, listen, what if we have a little mother-in-law, daughter-in-law dinner tonight?",9,Big Bang Theory,124,19
47993,Penny,23," Or I invite a few girlfriends, 'cause hearing you say the two of us just sent a chill right down my spine.",9,Big Bang Theory,107,22
47996,Amy,23, What are you doing here? You're not Sheldon.,9,Big Bang Theory,45,8
47998,Amy,23, Hold on. He paid you to get out of spending time with me?,9,Big Bang Theory,58,13
48000,Amy,23, We're not going shopping together.,9,Big Bang Theory,35,5
48002,Amy,23, Can you understand why I might be annoyed right now?,9,Big Bang Theory,53,10
48005,Howard,23," We've waited in a lot of lines together, haven't we?",9,Big Bang Theory,53,10
48006,Sheldon,23, Remember when we camped out for the Doctor Who panel at Comic-Con?,9,Big Bang Theory,67,12
48007,Raj,23," Yeah, sleeping under the stars with other fans who love the show as much as we do.",9,Big Bang Theory,83,17
48008,Leonard,23," Waking up, wondering which one of those fans stole our wallets.",9,Big Bang Theory,64,11
48009,Sheldon,23," Stuart, what are you doing here?",9,Big Bang Theory,33,6
48011,Sheldon,23," I don't understand. You were happy to do this when I hired you. Why, why are you upset with me now?",9,Big Bang Theory,100,21
48013,Sheldon,23," Well, I suppose turnabout is fair play.",9,Big Bang Theory,40,7
48016,Amy,23," You know, just when I think we're making progress in our relationship, we revert to our old patterns where thoughts and feelings go unexpressed. I mean, if he didn't want to go shopping with me, why didn't he just say so?",9,Big Bang Theory,222,41
48018,Amy,23," I'm sorry, I've been going on and on.",9,Big Bang Theory,38,8
48020,Amy,23, I called him babe once. He asked me to get a drug test.,9,Big Bang Theory,56,13
48022,Amy,23, Thank you.,9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
48023,Penny,23," You know, she's my mother-in-law. Why can't I bond with her like that?",9,Big Bang Theory,71,13
48025,Amy,23, Do you realize it took me five years to get a massage from him?,9,Big Bang Theory,64,14
48027,Amy,23, Three minutes. And he used a kitchen timer. I felt like a soft-boiled egg.,9,Big Bang Theory,75,14
48028,Penny,23," You know, being in a relationship with Leonard also comes with its challenges.",9,Big Bang Theory,79,13
48030,Amy,23," Maybe it's Sheldon, here to say he's sorry.",9,Big Bang Theory,44,8
48032,Amy,23," Bernadette, I'll give you five dollars to slam the door.",9,Big Bang Theory,57,10
48035,Raj,23," Boy, all this standing's making me tired. Good thing I brought my collapsible stick chair.",9,Big Bang Theory,91,15
48036,Howard,23, Not the stick chair. You look like an idiot on that thing.,9,Big Bang Theory,59,12
48037,Raj,23," Sticks and stones may break my bones, but chairs on sticks are comfy.",9,Big Bang Theory,70,13
48039,Sheldon,23, Hey. Is everything smoothed out with Amy?,9,Big Bang Theory,42,7
48041,Sheldon,23, Did you make the apology as sincere as I would have?,9,Big Bang Theory,53,11
48043,Sheldon,23," Oh, well, that's laying it on a little thick.",9,Big Bang Theory,46,9
48044,Leonard,23, You think it's time you apologize to her yourself?,9,Big Bang Theory,51,9
48045,Sheldon,23," I suppose so. But if I get out of the line, I'll lose my spot.",9,Big Bang Theory,63,15
48047,Sheldon,23, You would do that?,9,Big Bang Theory,19,4
48049,Sheldon,23, You're a good man.,9,Big Bang Theory,19,4
48057,Amy,23," Oh, was it, uh, Dr. Jenofski? I just saw his TED Talk.",9,Big Bang Theory,55,12
48060,Penny,23," Um, it has seat warmers.",9,Big Bang Theory,25,5
48061,Sheldon,23,  Amy.  Amy.  Amy.,9,Big Bang Theory,18,3
48062,Amy,23, Come in.,9,Big Bang Theory,9,2
48063,Sheldon,23," Hello, everyone. Oh, Beverly, good to see you. I'd love to chat, but there's a line that could start moving any minute, so let's do this. Amy? A proper apology requires three steps. Step one, an admission of wrongdoing. Amy, I was wrong. Step two, a promise never to repeat said action. Amy, that action will never be repeated, and that's a promise. Step three, an earnest request for forgiveness. Amy, I hope you can forgive me. And I hope you do it right now, 'cause there's an Uber waiting downstairs, and I don't want to repeat this apology nonsense with my driver Ganesh.",9,Big Bang Theory,577,104
48064,Amy,23, Fine.,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
48065,Sheldon,23," Oh, thanks, you're a peach. Beverly, we'll catch up soon. Bernadette, it was a pleasure as always, Penny, you have spinach in your teeth.",9,Big Bang Theory,138,24
48066,Penny,23, How long have I had spinach in my teeth?,9,Big Bang Theory,41,9
48069,Howard,23, You look like you come with a kickstand.,9,Big Bang Theory,41,8
48070,Raj,23, You can't make me feel bad.,9,Big Bang Theory,28,6
48071,Howard,23," Hmm, maybe not. Leonard?",9,Big Bang Theory,25,4
48072,Leonard,23," So, when the aliens brought you back, they just left the probe in?",9,Big Bang Theory,67,13
48073,Sheldon,23, I'm back.,9,Big Bang Theory,10,2
48074,Leonard,23," Hey, how'd it go?",9,Big Bang Theory,18,4
48075,Sheldon,23," It went well. Yeah, I've learned that if you never say you're sorry, the times you do really puts them on their heels. Uh, Stuart, I relieve you of your line duties.",9,Big Bang Theory,166,32
48077,Howard,23, I'll give you a dollar if you make fun of Raj.,9,Big Bang Theory,47,11
48079,Howard,23, Five.,9,Big Bang Theory,6,1
48081,Howard,23," Uh, if you ever need a reference or anything, just let me know.",9,Big Bang Theory,64,13
48084,Sheldon,23, Did you see that? He just cut the line.,9,Big Bang Theory,40,9
48085,Leonard,23, He's just joining his friends; it's fine.,9,Big Bang Theory,42,7
48086,Sheldon,23," No, it's not fine. It is a breach of line etiquette.",9,Big Bang Theory,53,11
48087,Howard,23, We're near the front of the line. We'll get in either way.,9,Big Bang Theory,59,12
48088,Sheldon,23, What if every person in front of us let someone cut?,9,Big Bang Theory,53,11
48089,Leonard,23, We'd still get in.,9,Big Bang Theory,19,4
48090,Sheldon,23, What if each of those people let someone cut?,9,Big Bang Theory,46,9
48091,Leonard,23, Still get in.,9,Big Bang Theory,14,3
48092,Sheldon,23, But then each of those people let someone cut?,9,Big Bang Theory,47,9
48093,Leonard,23," We'd still get in, but first I'd hit you over the head with his stick chair.",9,Big Bang Theory,77,16
48094,Sheldon,23, Excuse me.,9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
48095,Leonard,23," Oh, please don't.",9,Big Bang Theory,18,3
48096,Sheldon,23," Uh, uh, I couldn't help but notice that you cut the line.",9,Big Bang Theory,58,12
48098,Sheldon,23," Well, no. It's not cool. If there were reserved seating, and we all had tickets, that would be fine. But this line is first-come, first-served. Not show up tardy and nevertheless be first served. Right here.",9,Big Bang Theory,208,36
48099,Leonard,23, No.,9,Big Bang Theory,4,1
48100,Sheldon,23, You need to go to the back of the line.,9,Big Bang Theory,40,10
48102,Sheldon,23, Mrs. Wunch in fourth grade. And my slogan was a line that's straight is a line that's great.,9,Big Bang Theory,93,18
48104,Leonard,23," Boy, I wish I could say no.",9,Big Bang Theory,28,7
48107,Amy,23," Well, he's come a long way. Or a short way very slowly, so it feels like a long way.",9,Big Bang Theory,85,19
48109,Amy,23," Oh, sure. I'll, I'll talk to Sheldon about it. You know, Bernadette's husband is a former astronaut.",9,Big Bang Theory,101,17
48115,Penny,23," Okay, you know what? This is ridiculous. I've been trying to make a connection with you all day, and clearly I'm getting nowhere.",9,Big Bang Theory,130,23
48117,Penny,23," What I was seeking was some sort of friendship. But at this point, I'll take you not insulting me to my face.",9,Big Bang Theory,110,22
48119,Penny,23, You've been doing it all day. Do you even know what an insult is?,9,Big Bang Theory,66,14
48121,Penny,23," Okay, good example.",9,Big Bang Theory,20,3
48123,Sheldon,23, What about Joss Whedon's work makes you think he'd be okay with rule-breakers and line-cutters?,9,Big Bang Theory,96,15
48125,Sheldon,23," They work for SHIELD, which is a sanctioned department of the U.S. Government. Do you work for a sanctioned department of the U.S. Government?",9,Big Bang Theory,143,24
48127,Raj,23, He's got him there. The D even stands for department.,9,Big Bang Theory,54,10
48128,Sheldon,23," Excuse me, excuse me, can I please see a show of hands? Who here takes issue with this person cutting the line?",9,Big Bang Theory,112,22
48130,Sheldon,23," Well, what a sad state of affairs. That you've all been so ground down by life, you don't even notice when someone disrespects you.",9,Big Bang Theory,132,24
48131,Howard,23," I can't believe we're gonna get beat up, and it's not because of your chair.",9,Big Bang Theory,77,15
48132,Sheldon,23," You know, right now, at the back of this line, there's a movie fan like you who's not going to get in, because this person simply doesn't care. Yeah, well, 61 years ago, there was another person at the back of the line and her name was Rosa Parks.",9,Big Bang Theory,248,49
48133,Leonard,23," Okay, you may have to pretend you're black to get us out of here.",9,Big Bang Theory,66,14
48134,Sheldon,23," Now, let's follow in that brave woman's footsteps, and stand up for ourselves. And, and I realize that she stood up by remaining seated, but now is not the time to enjoy the irony of that. Now, I ask you again. Who here takes issue with this person",9,Big Bang Theory,249,48
48136,Sheldon,23, I most certainly did not.,9,Big Bang Theory,26,5
48139,Sheldon,23," Excuse me, I paid someone to wait in line for me, and then when I arrived, he left, so what you saw, my good woman, was swapsies, not cutsies. Oh, no, no, no, no, wait, I ask you all again, a show of hands. Who here takes issue well, stop moving. he's gonna get in.",9,Big Bang Theory,266,55
48140,Leonard,23," Buddy, let it go.",9,Big Bang Theory,18,4
48141,Sheldon,23," No, I can't. This isn't right.",9,Big Bang Theory,31,6
48142,Leonard,23, You did everything you could.,9,Big Bang Theory,30,5
48143,Sheldon,23," No, I could've done more.",9,Big Bang Theory,26,5
48144,Leonard,23," Now, now, you denigrated the memory of a great civil rights pioneer. That's all anyone could ask.",9,Big Bang Theory,98,17
48146,Penny,23," To be honest, I'm surprised you cared about the wedding at all.",9,Big Bang Theory,64,12
48148,Amy,23, I know how you feel. She didn't invite any of us.,9,Big Bang Theory,50,11
48149,Penny,23, It was spur of the moment.,9,Big Bang Theory,27,6
48152,Penny,23," Thank you. So if we would have asked you to come to Vegas to see us get married, you would've come?",9,Big Bang Theory,100,21
48154,Penny,23, You really think we made a mistake?,9,Big Bang Theory,36,7
48156,Penny,23," Wow. Okay. Well, um, how about this? Maybe while you're still in town, Leonard and I could have another small ceremony. You know, if you're interested.",9,Big Bang Theory,152,26
48158,Penny,23, She would find it perfectly acceptable. You guys saw it. We bonded.,9,Big Bang Theory,68,12
48161,Howard,23," I'm fine. Be right out. Am I an American hero? Well, that's a good question, Jim. Don't you think once an astronaut leaves the planet, he's a hero to all the nations of the Earth? Okey dokey. I think I have time for one more question.",9,Big Bang Theory,235,46
48163,Leonard,24, Hey.,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
48164,Penny,24," Hi, how was the screening?",9,Big Bang Theory,27,5
48165,Leonard,24," Oh, Sheldon invoked Rosa Parks to make somebody who cut the line feel bad, but only the white people felt bad.",9,Big Bang Theory,111,21
48166,Penny,24," Ugh, I should've never bought him that colouring book that explains Black History Month.",9,Big Bang Theory,89,14
48167,Leonard,24, How'd it go with my mother?,9,Big Bang Theory,28,6
48168,Penny,24," Uh, you know, it started a little rocky, but I think we got to a good place.",9,Big Bang Theory,77,17
48169,Leonard,24, Wow. Well done.,9,Big Bang Theory,16,3
48170,Penny,24," Yeah, and when I dropped her off at the hotel, she even gave me a hug.",9,Big Bang Theory,71,16
48171,Leonard,24," Did she think you were choking or I'm sorry, that's great. Thank you for spending time with her.",9,Big Bang Theory,97,18
48172,Penny,24," No problem. Um, so listen, I don't know if you have any plans next weekend, but I kind of promised your mom we'd have another wedding ceremony so she could attend this time.",9,Big Bang Theory,174,33
48173,Leonard,24," Wait, we're gonna get married again?",9,Big Bang Theory,37,6
48174,Penny,24," Yeah, kind of, but now we can invite our friends and family.",9,Big Bang Theory,61,12
48175,Leonard,24, Seems like a lot of trouble for a hug.,9,Big Bang Theory,39,9
48176,Penny,24," Come on, it'll be fun, and, you know, your mom was genuinely hurt we didn't invite her to the first one.",9,Big Bang Theory,105,21
48177,Leonard,24," Look, in our defence, it was kind of a spur of the moment thing, and also, we don't like her.",9,Big Bang Theory,94,20
48178,Penny,24," Leonard, come on, she's your mom. If we can do something to make her happy, why wouldn't we?",9,Big Bang Theory,93,18
48179,Leonard,24," I just said why, we don't like her.",9,Big Bang Theory,36,8
48180,Penny,24," Hey, look, then forget about her, let's do it for us. We could keep it small and informal. This time we can invite our families.",9,Big Bang Theory,129,25
48181,Leonard,24, Is your brother out of prison?,9,Big Bang Theory,31,6
48182,Penny,24," Thanks to overcrowding, yeah.",9,Big Bang Theory,30,4
48183,Leonard,24, I'd love it if my dad could come.,9,Big Bang Theory,34,8
48184,Penny,24," Oh, you have to invite him. I haven't seen him since the divorce.",9,Big Bang Theory,66,13
48185,Leonard,24," Oh, he's like a different man. He stopped twitching, and I think he grew an inch and a half.",9,Big Bang Theory,93,19
48186,Penny,24," Well, then it's settled. Yay. So funny. I never thought my second marriage would be to you.",9,Big Bang Theory,92,17
48188,Penny,24," Okay, so it's not a legal ceremony, it's just a chance for us to redo our vows so everyone can be part of it.",9,Big Bang Theory,110,24
48189,Amy,24, So there's no maid of honour?,9,Big Bang Theory,30,6
48190,Penny,24, No.,9,Big Bang Theory,4,1
48191,Amy,24," Huh. But if I were to, say, wear a purple satin dress with a sweetheart neckline and stand near you, you wouldn't be able to stop me, right?",9,Big Bang Theory,141,28
48192,Penny,24, I don't see how I could.,9,Big Bang Theory,25,6
48193,Amy,24, Then I graciously accept.,9,Big Bang Theory,26,4
48195,Penny,24, I was kind of hoping you would.,9,Big Bang Theory,32,7
48196,Amy,24," Wait, now I'm just some lousy maid of honour?",9,Big Bang Theory,46,9
48197,Sheldon,24," Hey, good news, I just got off the phone with my mother. She is coming to the wedding.",9,Big Bang Theory,87,18
48198,Penny,24," Okay, wait, you're inviting people to our wedding?",9,Big Bang Theory,51,8
48199,Sheldon,24," Yes, I'm inviting people to our wedding. Yeah, I've already asked Stephen Hawking and Robert Downey Jr, and, now don't get your hopes up, 'cause he's pretty busy, but Erno Rubik.",9,Big Bang Theory,179,31
48201,Sheldon,24, Seriously? He invented the Rubik's Cube.,9,Big Bang Theory,41,6
48202,Penny,24," Okay, fine, but why would you invite him to our wedding?",9,Big Bang Theory,57,11
48203,Sheldon,24," Because, despite his fame and fortune, he strikes me as a lonely man.",9,Big Bang Theory,70,13
48205,Penny,24," Yeah, I'm also doing it for Leonard. I think this could really help their relationship.",9,Big Bang Theory,88,15
48208,Leonard,24," Sorry, but I don't think I need your permission to have my father at my wedding.",9,Big Bang Theory,81,16
48210,Leonard,24," I know, and there's no excuse for that.",9,Big Bang Theory,40,8
48212,Leonard,24," I was wrong, there's three excuses for that.",9,Big Bang Theory,45,8
48214,Howard,24," Oh, my God. It's working.",9,Big Bang Theory,26,5
48215,Raj,24, You sure?,9,Big Bang Theory,10,2
48216,Howard,24," Look. The system is maintaining its own stability, the quantum vortex apparatus is now controlling the orientation.",9,Big Bang Theory,116,17
48217,Raj,24, You're right. You realize what this means?,9,Big Bang Theory,43,7
48218,Howard,24, Yeah. I do. It's proof of concept. We've got a workable guidance system.,9,Big Bang Theory,73,13
48219,Raj,24, Congratulations.,9,Big Bang Theory,17,1
48220,Howard,24," Thanks. Hey, I just got an e-mail from the U.S. Air Force.",9,Big Bang Theory,59,12
48221,Raj,24, Open it.,9,Big Bang Theory,9,2
48222,Howard,24," Hmm. We request a meeting at your earliest convenience regarding your quantum guidance system, provisional patent 62/295118. That's weird.",9,Big Bang Theory,139,19
48223,Raj,24, Is there a window around here we don't know about?,9,Big Bang Theory,51,10
48224,Howard,24, I'm sure it's just a coincidence.,9,Big Bang Theory,34,6
48225,Raj,24," Yeah, of course. What else could it be? Boy, do I love America.",9,Big Bang Theory,64,13
48228,Sheldon,24," Oh, you're welcome.",9,Big Bang Theory,20,3
48230,Amy,24," My pleasure, Mrs. Cooper.",9,Big Bang Theory,26,4
48232,Amy,24," Okay, Mary.",9,Big Bang Theory,12,2
48233,Sheldon,24," You know, that doesn't work for me, let's stay with Mrs. Cooper.",9,Big Bang Theory,65,12
48235,Sheldon,24," Wu-wu, what? That's what I called you till I got to know you better.",9,Big Bang Theory,69,14
48237,Sheldon,24," Well, actually, I",9,Big Bang Theory,18,3
48238,Amy,24, It sure was.,9,Big Bang Theory,13,3
48240,Sheldon,24," Excuse me, I take care of him.",9,Big Bang Theory,31,7
48242,Amy,24," Oh, well, the usual gang. Penny's family is coming tomorrow.",9,Big Bang Theory,61,10
48243,Sheldon,24," Yeah, and Leonard's mother's already here.",9,Big Bang Theory,43,6
48245,Amy,24," You've met her, right?",9,Big Bang Theory,23,4
48247,Sheldon,24," Mother, she's an atheist, not a vampire.",9,Big Bang Theory,41,7
48254,Sheldon,24," I don't know what we were worried about, they're getting along great.",9,Big Bang Theory,70,12
48260,Penny,24," Whew, chilly.",9,Big Bang Theory,14,2
48261,Amy,24, I think I can see my breath.,9,Big Bang Theory,29,7
48263,Penny,24, Sorry.,9,Big Bang Theory,7,1
48264,Amy,24, Sorry.,9,Big Bang Theory,7,1
48266,Howard,24, I can't believe I was so naive. The military is just gonna take over the whole project. And you know what happens if we object? We disappear. Like off the map. Like every American Idol winner since season four.,9,Big Bang Theory,211,39
48268,Howard,24," Am I? Am I? What, what do you want to bet some black ops guy is reprinting my high school yearbook and I'm no longer in it? That chess club picture is now just David Zimmerman and Elaine Cho.",9,Big Bang Theory,192,39
48269,Raj,24," Okay, look, I'm on the Air Force Web site, and the department that e-mailed you is in charge of acquisitions. So maybe they just want to give you a lot of money for your invention.",9,Big Bang Theory,181,35
48270,Howard,24," Oh, please, that's not how it works. You saw E.T., Avatar, Jurassic World. The military just shows up and takes over.",9,Big Bang Theory,118,21
48272,Howard,24," I'm sorry, you find this funny?",9,Big Bang Theory,32,6
48273,Raj,24," No, I was just thinking about Jurassic World. Boy, that was terrible.",9,Big Bang Theory,70,12
48275,Leonard,24," Oh, we have to use the stairs.",9,Big Bang Theory,31,7
48277,Leonard,24," Uh, I don't, any day now.",9,Big Bang Theory,26,6
48279,Leonard,24," Hey, I, I know things are a little rough with you and Mom, but I'm really glad you're here.",9,Big Bang Theory,92,19
48281,Leonard,24, Penny's really looking forward to seeing you.,9,Big Bang Theory,46,7
48283,Leonard,24," Thanks, Dad.",9,Big Bang Theory,13,2
48286,Sheldon,24, Isn't this nice?,9,Big Bang Theory,17,3
48287,Leonard,24," Hey, we're here.",9,Big Bang Theory,17,3
48288,Penny,24, Alfred. Thank you for coming!,9,Big Bang Theory,30,5
48290,Penny,24, Thank you.,9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
48291,Leonard,24," Dad, you remember Sheldon.",9,Big Bang Theory,27,4
48292,Sheldon,24, Dr. Hofstadter.,9,Big Bang Theory,16,2
48294,Leonard,24," This is Sheldon's mother, Mary.",9,Big Bang Theory,32,5
48297,Leonard,24," And his girlfriend, Amy.",9,Big Bang Theory,25,4
48299,Amy,24, Hi.,9,Big Bang Theory,4,1
48300,Leonard,24," And, of course, Mom.",9,Big Bang Theory,21,4
48303,Sheldon,24," All right, now I'm starting to sense a little tension.",9,Big Bang Theory,55,10
48304,Leonard,24," All right, you two, don't start. Penny and I are throwing this second wedding for your benefit. Can you please not ruin it?",9,Big Bang Theory,124,23
48307,Leonard,24, Mom.,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
48310,Sheldon,24, Mom.,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
48312,Penny,24," Uh, who's hungry? We have a reservation at the best restaurant in town.",9,Big Bang Theory,72,13
48313,Sheldon,24, It only got three-and-a-half stars on Yelp.,9,Big Bang Theory,44,7
48314,Amy,24, Sheldon.,9,Big Bang Theory,9,1
48315,Sheldon,24, I'm not sorry. That's true.,9,Big Bang Theory,28,5
48317,Howard,24," I don't know what to do. It's the Air Force. I mean, should I respond to their e-mail? Ignore it?",9,Big Bang Theory,98,20
48318,Raj,24, You can't ignore it. It's not that postcard that says it's time to go back to the dentist.,9,Big Bang Theory,91,18
48320,Howard,24," One sec. I'm just afraid if I respond, then they'll know I got it.",9,Big Bang Theory,67,14
48321,Raj,24," Oh, dude. The minute you opened that e-mail, they knew you got it. I mean, they're probably looking at you through the camera right now. I love America.",9,Big Bang Theory,153,28
48323,Howard,24, It's not nonsense. This is how the U.S. military works.,9,Big Bang Theory,56,10
48324,Raj,24," Oh, if it's even the U.S. Military. It could be foreign military pretending to be American.",9,Big Bang Theory,92,16
48325,Howard,24," You're right. We turn our guidance system over to them, next thing we know, they're using it against us.",9,Big Bang Theory,105,19
48326,Raj,24, I also love the enemies of America.,9,Big Bang Theory,36,7
48329,Penny,24," No, of course not.",9,Big Bang Theory,19,4
48331,Leonard,24," Mom, please save something for the toast.",9,Big Bang Theory,42,7
48336,Sheldon,24," Don't laugh, she wasn't joking.",9,Big Bang Theory,32,5
48337,Amy,24, Play with your phone.,9,Big Bang Theory,22,4
48345,Raj,24," Howard, there must be someone at the university you can go to for help.",9,Big Bang Theory,72,14
48346,Howard,24, Are you kidding? They're probably the ones who leaked it to the military in the first place.,9,Big Bang Theory,93,17
48347,Raj,24," What about the guy on the Channel Four News? You know, Four on Your Side? Maybe he can be on your side.",9,Big Bang Theory,104,22
48348,Howard,24," I'm being harassed by the government, not trying to get to the bottom of a dog-walking scam.",9,Big Bang Theory,93,17
48350,Raj,24, I'd like to think the Four on Your Side guy cares about me.,9,Big Bang Theory,60,13
48352,Penny,24," You know, Beverly, I know you and Alfred have your differences, but if you think about it, if you hadn't married him, there'd be no Leonard. So that's good, right?",9,Big Bang Theory,164,30
48354,Leonard,24, Is that Howard in front of us?,9,Big Bang Theory,31,7
48355,Penny,24," Oh, maybe. Get closer.",9,Big Bang Theory,23,4
48356,Howard,24," Oh, God. I think someone's following us.",9,Big Bang Theory,41,7
48358,Howard,24," I'm not being ridiculous, he's right on my tail.",9,Big Bang Theory,49,9
48359,Raj,24," Uh, turn left here and see if he turns with us.",9,Big Bang Theory,48,11
48360,Penny,24," Well, why is he turning here? The restaurant's the other way.",9,Big Bang Theory,62,11
48361,Leonard,24, I don't know. He uses that traffic app. Maybe there's an accident.,9,Big Bang Theory,67,12
48362,Penny,24," Oh, so follow him.",9,Big Bang Theory,19,4
48363,Raj,24," Oh, no.",9,Big Bang Theory,8,2
48364,Howard,24, I told you.,9,Big Bang Theory,12,3
48366,Penny,24," Well, go faster. You're losing him.",9,Big Bang Theory,36,6
48367,Leonard,24, What is his hurry?,9,Big Bang Theory,19,4
48368,Penny,24," You know what, flash your lights. Let him know it's you.",9,Big Bang Theory,57,11
48369,Howard,24, He's flashing his lights. What's that mean?,9,Big Bang Theory,44,7
48370,Raj,24," I, I think he wants us to pull over.",9,Big Bang Theory,37,9
48372,Howard,24, Hang on.,9,Big Bang Theory,9,2
48381,Amy,24, Do you realize what's happening here?,9,Big Bang Theory,38,6
48382,Sheldon,24," Yeah, I do. They're filling up on bread and ruining their meal.",9,Big Bang Theory,64,12
48383,Leonard,24, Hey.,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
48384,Penny,24, Hey.,9,Big Bang Theory,5,1
48385,Amy,24, What took you guys so long?,9,Big Bang Theory,28,6
48386,Leonard,24," Oh, we were following Howard, but for some reason, he turned off his headlights and went up a one-way street.",9,Big Bang Theory,110,20
48387,Penny,24," So, what did we miss?",9,Big Bang Theory,22,5
48391,Leonard,24," Okay, Mom, you sit over there.",9,Big Bang Theory,31,6
48392,Penny,24," Yeah, I'm gonna call Bernadette and see what's keeping them.",9,Big Bang Theory,61,10
48393,Sheldon,24," If I'd known you were broke, I wouldn't have made a big deal about the bread.",9,Big Bang Theory,78,16
48396,Howard,24," I'm telling you, I'm not on drugs. The government's out to get me.",9,Big Bang Theory,67,13
48400,Sheldon,24," That's funny, because my father was not a very clever man.",9,Big Bang Theory,59,11
48401,Amy,24, I'd be lost without you.,9,Big Bang Theory,25,5
48402,Leonard,24," Uh, I would like to propose a toast to my wife and bride-to-be.",9,Big Bang Theory,64,13
48403,Sheldon,24," See, that's funny because",9,Big Bang Theory,26,4
48404,Amy,24, Back to your phone.,9,Big Bang Theory,20,4
48405,Leonard,24," Penny, I've always known I loved you, but this last year has shown me that I also love being married to you. Thank you for saying yes.",9,Big Bang Theory,135,27
48406,Penny,24," Oh, thanks for asking until I did.",9,Big Bang Theory,35,7
48407,Amy,24," Hear, hear.",9,Big Bang Theory,12,2
48408,Leonard,24, Cheers.,9,Big Bang Theory,8,1
48410,Penny,24, Aw.,9,Big Bang Theory,4,1
48418,Penny,24," Um, if, if we want to order the soufflÃ©, we might want to get on that.",9,Big Bang Theory,72,16
48420,Leonard,24," Sure, Dad.",9,Big Bang Theory,11,2
48428,Leonard,24, What is happening there?,9,Big Bang Theory,25,4
48429,Sheldon,24, I think it's pretty obvious. They don't want dessert 'cause they filled up on bread.,9,Big Bang Theory,85,15
48431,Sheldon,24, She's still not answering.,9,Big Bang Theory,27,4
48432,Leonard,24, My father's not texting me back.,9,Big Bang Theory,33,6
48433,Penny,24, â€˜Cause they both turned their phones off.,9,Big Bang Theory,44,7
48434,Sheldon,24, I don't like this at all.,9,Big Bang Theory,26,6
48435,Leonard,24, I don't like it either.,9,Big Bang Theory,24,5
48436,Penny,24, Really? â€˜Cause I love it.,9,Big Bang Theory,28,5
48438,Sheldon,1, Leonard? Leonard?,10,Big Bang Theory,18,2
48439,Leonard,1, What?,10,Big Bang Theory,6,1
48440,Sheldon,1, You realize you and I could become brothers.,10,Big Bang Theory,45,8
48441,Leonard,1, We're not gonna be brothers. We're not gonna be stepbrothers. Go to sleep.,10,Big Bang Theory,75,13
48442,Sheldon,1, I hope you're right. â€˜Cause a grown man living with his brother and his brother's wife is weird.,10,Big Bang Theory,99,18
48443,Leonard,1, Go to sleep.,10,Big Bang Theory,13,3
48444,Sheldon,1, Okay. Do you think your father's doing unspeakable things to my mother?,10,Big Bang Theory,72,12
48445,Leonard,1, No.,10,Big Bang Theory,4,1
48446,Sheldon,1, Are you saying that because the things are unspeakable?,10,Big Bang Theory,56,9
48447,Sheldon,1, Very well.,10,Big Bang Theory,11,2
48448,Leonard,1, I'm sorry if this stuff is gonna make the ceremony awkward.,10,Big Bang Theory,60,11
48449,Penny,1," God, I thought my brother fresh out of jail was gonna make everyone uncomfortable, but now this.",10,Big Bang Theory,97,17
48450,Sheldon,1," Hey, if you want me to sleep you're gonna have to stop talking.",10,Big Bang Theory,64,13
48452,Penny,1," Okay, I'm gonna go pick up my family. Like an hour and half, two hours, depending on traffic.",10,Big Bang Theory,94,18
48453,Leonard,1," Yeah, drive safe. ",10,Big Bang Theory,19,3
48454,Penny,1," Oh, hey, and do yourself a favour, all right? When Beverly gets here, do not bring up last night. All right? As far as you're concerned, you don't know anything, you didn't see anything. I want you just to play dumb.",10,Big Bang Theory,217,41
48455,Sheldon,1, It was nice of her to show us playing dumb with an example.,10,Big Bang Theory,60,13
48456,Penny,1," What? Oh. Hi. Okay, hey there, I got, I'm sorry, I got to go now.",10,Big Bang Theory,66,15
48458,Penny,1, Why?,10,Big Bang Theory,5,1
48460,Leonard,1," Well, why? What's wrong?",10,Big Bang Theory,25,4
48461,Sheldon,1," Whuh, are we still doing the dumb thing? Okay, why, what's wrong?",10,Big Bang Theory,66,12
48463,Sheldon,1," Oh, golly, however did he humiliate you?",10,Big Bang Theory,41,7
48465,Sheldon,1," Do I say stop what, or just throw in the towel?",10,Big Bang Theory,48,11
48467,Sheldon,1," Oh, excuse me, that is my mother you're talking about, however accurately.",10,Big Bang Theory,75,12
48468,Penny,1," Okay, Beverley, aren't you overreacting a little? All we know is they shared a cab and had a nightcap. ",10,Big Bang Theory,104,19
48469,Sheldon,1, And turned their phones off.,10,Big Bang Theory,29,5
48470,Leonard,1," Not helping, buddy. Mother, Penny and I really want you to be part of this. Please stay.",10,Big Bang Theory,89,17
48471,Penny,1," Yeah, plus if you leave, Alfred will know he got under your skin.",10,Big Bang Theory,66,13
48473,Sheldon,1," You know, also, if they did have coitus, we'll all be needing a skilled psychiatrist.",10,Big Bang Theory,86,15
48475,Raj,1, It is funny when you think about it.,10,Big Bang Theory,37,8
48476,Howard,1, Maybe to you. You didn't get a $500 traffic ticket.,10,Big Bang Theory,52,10
48478,Howard,1," Hey, if thinking secret government agents are chasing you makes you a lunatic, then, yeah, okay.",10,Big Bang Theory,97,16
48479,Raj,1," Oh, I'll get it.",10,Big Bang Theory,17,4
48481,Howard,1, I have performance anxiety. You of all people should know that.,10,Big Bang Theory,64,11
48482,Raj,1, Hello.,10,Big Bang Theory,7,1
48484,Raj,1, Howard Wolowitz?,10,Big Bang Theory,17,2
48486,Raj,1, Address?,10,Big Bang Theory,9,1
48488,Raj,1," Um, no. ",10,Big Bang Theory,9,2
48490,Raj,1, May I ask what this is about?,10,Big Bang Theory,30,7
48492,Raj,1, Very well.,10,Big Bang Theory,11,2
48494,Raj,1, Okay.,10,Big Bang Theory,6,1
48495,Howard,1," Raj, who's at the door?",10,Big Bang Theory,24,5
48496,Raj,1, That's not him.,10,Big Bang Theory,16,3
48498,Penny,1," Oh, I can't wait for you to meet everyone. I told them all about you.",10,Big Bang Theory,70,15
48500,Penny,1," Uh, not everything, just, like, the jail and drugs part.",10,Big Bang Theory,57,10
48502,Penny,1, What?,10,Big Bang Theory,6,1
48504,Penny,1," Well, Mom, I'm sorry, but",10,Big Bang Theory,26,5
48509,Penny,1," So, uh, Randall, can't believe after all these years you finally get to visit me in California.",10,Big Bang Theory,96,17
48518,Howard,1," That's great, now they know where I live.",10,Big Bang Theory,42,8
48519,Raj,1, What are you talking about? They've always known where you live.,10,Big Bang Theory,65,11
48521,Raj,1, Can we take a moment to discuss that I just lied to the government for you?,10,Big Bang Theory,76,16
48522,Howard,1, Yeah. I would not have done that for you.,10,Big Bang Theory,42,9
48524,Howard,1," All right, all right.",10,Big Bang Theory,22,4
48525,Raj,1," Hey, make sure you tell him that you weren't home when he came by and that your Indian friend gave you the message the moment you stepped through the door.",10,Big Bang Theory,156,30
48526,Howard,1," Yes, hello. Uh, this is Howard Wolowitz for Colonel Richard Williams.",10,Big Bang Theory,70,11
48527,Raj,1," Oh, I take it back, don't mention me.",10,Big Bang Theory,38,8
48528,Howard,1," Hi, Colonel Williams, how can I help you? What? Oh, uh, yes, he is from India. No, I don't know his immigration status. Relax, I'm still on hold. Speaking. Okay, sure, I can meet with you on Thursday. Caltech is fine. Yeah, and may I ask what this is about? I may not?",10,Big Bang Theory,269,53
48529,Raj,1, That's what he said to me.,10,Big Bang Theory,27,6
48531,Leonard,1," Here you are, Mother.",10,Big Bang Theory,22,4
48533,Leonard,1, I'm glad you decided to stay. It's gonna be special for Penny and me to share this with you.,10,Big Bang Theory,93,19
48535,Leonard,1," Yeah, special, like that.  That's them. Please don't make things any more awkward than they already are.",10,Big Bang Theory,105,17
48536,Sheldon,1," All right, so less or equally awkward, got it.",10,Big Bang Theory,47,9
48537,Leonard,1," Hey, guys, come on in.",10,Big Bang Theory,23,5
48541,Sheldon,1, Hello.,10,Big Bang Theory,7,1
48548,Sheldon,1," So, did you defile my mother or not?",10,Big Bang Theory,37,8
48551,Sheldon,1, Did that conversation include the phrase your genitals are a joy to behold?,10,Big Bang Theory,76,13
48554,Leonard,1, You don't know his girlfriend very well.,10,Big Bang Theory,41,7
48555,Sheldon,1, Or what a joy it is to behold my genitals.,10,Big Bang Theory,43,10
48557,Penny,1," All right, you guys, uh, get settled in, then we'll go across the hall and say hi to everyone.",10,Big Bang Theory,95,19
48561,Penny,1, I thought it was really funny.,10,Big Bang Theory,31,6
48565,Penny,1," Okay. Listen, Mom, I know you're nervous, but I promise you, no one is gonna judge you or this family.",10,Big Bang Theory,103,20
48570,Sheldon,1, A man named Jesus convinced you to build a church in Africa. You're kind of a sucker.,10,Big Bang Theory,86,17
48571,Leonard,1," Well, nothing happened, right? It's over. Until we get married a third time, you guys will never have to see each other again.",10,Big Bang Theory,127,23
48575,Sheldon,1, What? In the Chattahoochee National Forest in Georgia? I can't be the only one that knows that's halfway.,10,Big Bang Theory,106,18
48580,Leonard,1," Mary, I'm sorry you're in the middle of this.",10,Big Bang Theory,46,9
48582,Sheldon,1," What? But he's a mediocre academic. And according to Beverley, his sexual prowess is sub-par. He's basically Leonard with a bigger prostate.",10,Big Bang Theory,141,22
48583,Leonard,1, Are you saying that my dad's not good enough for your mom?,10,Big Bang Theory,59,12
48584,Sheldon,1," Yes, while also getting in a solid dig at you. Pretty efficient, huh?",10,Big Bang Theory,70,13
48585,Leonard,1, This is ridiculous. I'm going across the hall.,10,Big Bang Theory,47,8
48586,Sheldon,1, But why should you get to go and leave me here with your bickering parents?,10,Big Bang Theory,76,15
48587,Leonard,1," Fine, then you go.",10,Big Bang Theory,19,4
48590,Leonard,1, That still leaves me here with him.,10,Big Bang Theory,36,7
48591,Amy,1, Who's ready for a wedding?,10,Big Bang Theory,27,5
48592,Sheldon,1," Great, now I have to start all over.",10,Big Bang Theory,37,8
48595,Penny,1, Pretty good. I actually just got assigned a much better territory.,10,Big Bang Theory,67,11
48602,Penny,1," Well, I learned from the best.",10,Big Bang Theory,31,6
48604,Penny,1, Aw.,10,Big Bang Theory,4,1
48609,Leonard,1, Hello.,10,Big Bang Theory,7,1
48611,Penny,1, Hey.,10,Big Bang Theory,5,1
48613,Leonard,1," Oh, you, too. Hey, everyone, this is my mother, Beverley.",10,Big Bang Theory,58,10
48618,Amy,1, Are you excited to see your son walk down the aisle?,10,Big Bang Theory,53,11
48621,Sheldon,1," You made God sad today, Mom.",10,Big Bang Theory,29,6
48622,Amy,1," Sheldon, they haven't done anything wrong. I think it's nice they're hitting it off.",10,Big Bang Theory,85,14
48623,Sheldon,1," Well, that's still no reason to rush into anything. I mean, look at us. We took things remarkably slow. You and I, we didn't even hold hands for two years.",10,Big Bang Theory,156,30
48624,Amy,1, It was a lot hotter than it sounds.,10,Big Bang Theory,36,8
48626,Sheldon,1," Hey, hey. She's mine, take a cold shower, grandpa.",10,Big Bang Theory,51,9
48628,Howard,1, Why wouldn't that colonel say what the meeting's about? It has to be bad news.,10,Big Bang Theory,79,15
48629,Raj,1," Calm down, okay? Try not to think about it.",10,Big Bang Theory,44,9
48630,Howard,1, That's really stupid advice.,10,Big Bang Theory,29,4
48631,Raj,1, You know that hurts my feelings.,10,Big Bang Theory,33,6
48632,Howard,1," Calm down, try not to think about it.",10,Big Bang Theory,38,8
48633,Raj,1, Okay. ,10,Big Bang Theory,7,1
48634,Howard,1, Why do I bother talking to you?,10,Big Bang Theory,32,7
48635,Raj,1," Oh, come on. What's the worst that could come of this meeting?",10,Big Bang Theory,63,12
48636,Howard,1," I don't know. They take the invention away, and I get nothing?",10,Big Bang Theory,63,12
48637,Raj,1," Okay, that's not so bad. You know what happened to the scientists that worked on the Manhattan Project? The government forced them to move to the desert. They had to live in secret, and when Oppenheimer objected to what they made him do, they destroyed his reputation.",10,Big Bang Theory,269,47
48638,Howard,1, What's the point of that story?,10,Big Bang Theory,32,6
48639,Raj,1," I just read a book about Oppenheimer, seemed like a chance to show off.  There he is, there's my happy Hebraic homeboy. Yeah, that's the smile I'm gonna remember when you're living in the desert and I'm living with your wife.",10,Big Bang Theory,226,41
48647,Leonard,1," And he can't wait to meet you, too. Can I get anyone a drink?",10,Big Bang Theory,62,14
48650,Penny,1, Hey. Is everyone getting to know each other?,10,Big Bang Theory,45,8
48661,Sheldon,1, Why do people cry at weddings?,10,Big Bang Theory,31,6
48671,Sheldon,1," Speaking of love, STDs among the elderly are skyrocketing.",10,Big Bang Theory,59,9
48673,Howard,1, At least she's yelling at someone else for a change.,10,Big Bang Theory,53,10
48675,Penny,1," Okay, I understand everyone's a little tense today, so I am just gonna get to the important stuff. Leonard, standing here with you in front of our family and friends is bringing up a lot of feelings. Like what a good idea it was to elope the first time. But also how incredibly happy you make me. Thank you for marrying me. Hopefully for the last time.",10,Big Bang Theory,353,67
48676,Leonard,1," Penny, as a scientist, my job is to figure out why things happen. But I don't think I'll ever understand how someone like me could get to be with someone like you. You know, maybe I don't",10,Big Bang Theory,188,37
48677,Penny,1, Oh.,10,Big Bang Theory,4,1
48683,Sheldon,1," Yeah, excuse me, I need to say something to someone pretty special, and I just can't wait any longer.",10,Big Bang Theory,102,19
48684,Amy,1, It's happening.,10,Big Bang Theory,16,2
48685,Sheldon,1," Leonard, you and I have our ups and downs. But I have always considered you my family. Even before the recent threat of our parents fornicating like wrinkly old rabbits. I don't always show it, but you are of great importance to me. Both of you. ",10,Big Bang Theory,247,46
48686,Penny,1, Oh.,10,Big Bang Theory,4,1
48687,Leonard,1, Thank you.,10,Big Bang Theory,11,2
48691,Leonard,1," Hey, I'm just thrilled we're all getting along for a minute.",10,Big Bang Theory,61,11
48695,Leonard,1, That's okay. I can make it over.,10,Big Bang Theory,33,7
48699,Leonard,1, That was almost a minute.,10,Big Bang Theory,26,5
48702,Amy,1, You'll be at the airport an hour before your flight.,10,Big Bang Theory,53,10
48704,Sheldon,1, Plenty of time for you to meet another geriatric boy toy.,10,Big Bang Theory,58,11
48706,Sheldon,1, Yes ma'am.,10,Big Bang Theory,11,2
48707,Amy,1," Sheldon, you're mother's an attractive woman. You need to get use to the fact that men are going to be interested in her.",10,Big Bang Theory,122,23
48708,Sheldon,1," Well, and you need to drive the car and mind your business.",10,Big Bang Theory,60,12
48709,Amy,1, I will not have you be disrespectful to me.,10,Big Bang Theory,44,9
48710,Sheldon,1," What, you're not my mother.",10,Big Bang Theory,28,5
48712,Sheldon,1, Yes ma'am.,10,Big Bang Theory,11,2
48716,Penny,1," Oh, thanks, Mom.",10,Big Bang Theory,17,3
48718,Penny,1, Is he? I never noticed.,10,Big Bang Theory,24,5
48722,Sheldon,2, Look at this. Elon Musk has a theory that we're all just characters in some advanced civilization's video game.,10,Big Bang Theory,112,19
48723,Leonard,2, So some alien kid spent his money on the asthma-and-glasses upgrade for me?,10,Big Bang Theory,76,13
48724,Sheldon,2," Well, he doesn't say it's a good game.",10,Big Bang Theory,39,8
48725,Howard,2," All right, we got a problem.",10,Big Bang Theory,29,6
48726,Leonard,2, What's up?,10,Big Bang Theory,11,2
48727,Howard,2, The Air Force contacted me about our quantum gyroscope. They want to have a meeting.,10,Big Bang Theory,85,15
48728,Leonard,2, Really?,10,Big Bang Theory,8,1
48729,Raj,2, Yeah. This military guy showed up at Howard's door. He was terrifying.,10,Big Bang Theory,71,12
48730,Sheldon,2," Oh, what did he say?",10,Big Bang Theory,21,5
48731,Raj,2, He gave me his business card and asked me to please pass it along to Howard.,10,Big Bang Theory,77,16
48732,Sheldon,2, That doesn't sound terrifying.,10,Big Bang Theory,31,4
48733,Raj,2," To a white guy born here, no. If you are a brown guy whose name has a lot of syllables in it, terrifying.",10,Big Bang Theory,106,23
48734,Leonard,2," You realize if the military declares our research classified, they can take the whole thing away from us.",10,Big Bang Theory,106,18
48735,Howard,2," And if that happens, we'll never be able to sell it commercially.",10,Big Bang Theory,66,12
48736,Leonard,2, There goes our big payday.,10,Big Bang Theory,27,5
48737,Howard,2, I was counting on that money. I need to make as much as my wife so I don't have to try so hard in bed.,10,Big Bang Theory,103,25
48738,Leonard,2," You do that, too?",10,Big Bang Theory,18,4
48739,Howard,2," Oh, yeah. How do you think I stay this thin?",10,Big Bang Theory,45,10
48740,Sheldon,2," Gentlemen, I think we are losing sight of the real issue. We are on the precipice of becoming faceless cogs in the military-industrial complex. Isn't that exciting?",10,Big Bang Theory,165,27
48741,Raj,2," Well, you're kidding, right?",10,Big Bang Theory,29,4
48742,Sheldon,2," Not at all. In Star Wars, when the stormtroopers would march in perfect formation, harassing civilians, didn't you ever think, hey, that could be me?",10,Big Bang Theory,150,25
48743,Howard,2," Sheldon, we could be contributing to a weapons system that oppresses mankind for the next thousand years.",10,Big Bang Theory,106,17
48744,Sheldon,2," Okay, Howard's on board. What do you think, Leonard?",10,Big Bang Theory,53,9
48747,Penny,2," All right, we work at a giant pharmaceutical company. Get him some anti-anxiety meds.",10,Big Bang Theory,86,14
48749,Penny,2," You know, when Leonard's feeling anxious I make him take a long walk.",10,Big Bang Theory,70,13
48750,Amy,2, Does that help?,10,Big Bang Theory,16,3
48751,Penny,2," Well, for a while. Then he comes back.",10,Big Bang Theory,39,8
48753,Amy,2, What's wrong?,10,Big Bang Theory,14,2
48755,Amy,2," You did already know, right?",10,Big Bang Theory,29,5
48757,Penny,2, No. You told me not to.,10,Big Bang Theory,24,6
48759,Amy,2, Why don't you want anyone to know?,10,Big Bang Theory,35,7
48761,Penny,2, Would they really do that?,10,Big Bang Theory,27,5
48764,Raj,2, Wail till I Snapchat that my friends might be working on a top secret government project.,10,Big Bang Theory,90,16
48765,Leonard,2, Are you crazy? You can't put that on Snapchat.,10,Big Bang Theory,47,9
48766,Raj,2," Fine, I'll put it on Facebook like a caveman.",10,Big Bang Theory,46,9
48767,Howard,2," You know, maybe before our meeting we should talk to a lawyer.",10,Big Bang Theory,63,12
48768,Leonard,2, That's not a bad idea.,10,Big Bang Theory,23,5
48769,Raj,2," Well, you must have someone in your family that's a lawyer.",10,Big Bang Theory,60,11
48770,Howard,2," Why? Because I'm Jewish? That's like me saying, hey, you're Indian, doesn't your cousin work in a call centre?",10,Big Bang Theory,111,19
48771,Raj,2, My cousin does work in a call centre.,10,Big Bang Theory,38,8
48772,Howard,2, And my cousin's a lawyer.,10,Big Bang Theory,26,5
48773,Sheldon,2," We don't need Howard's cousin. No, we have me. ",10,Big Bang Theory,48,9
48774,Leonard,2," You're not a lawyer, Sheldon, you're just a know-it-all.",10,Big Bang Theory,57,9
48775,Sheldon,2, I am not a know-it-all. I'm a person who knows lots of things and likes to correct other people when they're wrong.,10,Big Bang Theory,116,22
48776,Leonard,2, That's the definition of being a know-it-all.,10,Big Bang Theory,46,7
48777,Sheldon,2," Or in German, a Besserwisser.",10,Big Bang Theory,30,5
48779,Penny,2, How did you think you were gonna hide your pregnancy?,10,Big Bang Theory,54,10
48781,Amy,2, Where did you get empty Dove Bar wrappers?,10,Big Bang Theory,43,8
48783,Amy,2," Well, whatever happens, we're here for you.",10,Big Bang Theory,44,7
48785,Penny,2," Yeah, drive safe. We love you. And give us a call Oh, my God, it was me, it was me. I'm the one who blabbed she was pregnant!",10,Big Bang Theory,126,28
48786,Amy,2, What?,10,Big Bang Theory,6,1
48787,Penny,2, I didn't mean to. It just slipped out in front of her assistantone day. I,10,Big Bang Theory,74,15
48789,Penny,2," Oh, here's your coat, honey. That's such a cute jacket. Oh God, I feel so bad, I just lied to her.",10,Big Bang Theory,99,21
48790,Amy,2," Oh, but you did it so well. That's amazing, it's like watching a sculptor, but your clay was lies.",10,Big Bang Theory,99,19
48791,Penny,2, Is that really what's important right now?,10,Big Bang Theory,43,7
48792,Amy,2," I mean, seriously, you have got to let me scan your brain when you're being dishonest so I can see what lights up.",10,Big Bang Theory,115,23
48793,Penny,2," That's super helpful, Amy. Thanks a lot. I can't wait to do that.",10,Big Bang Theory,66,13
48794,Amy,2, I can see a clump of bitch cells lightin' up from here.,10,Big Bang Theory,56,12
48796,Howard,2, Give me a second to call my cousin.,10,Big Bang Theory,36,8
48797,Sheldon,2, I don't see how a tax lawyer from Fort Lauderdale could be helpful regarding intellectual property.,10,Big Bang Theory,100,16
48798,Howard,2," First of all, he's in Boca Raton, which is better than Fort Lauderdale. But more importantly, he lasted two days on Jeopardy, so he's clearly a smart guy.",10,Big Bang Theory,155,28
48800,Howard,2," Hey, Marty. Thanks for talking to us.",10,Big Bang Theory,38,7
48802,Howard,2," Well, I married a little Catholic girl, so we're even. Anyway, this is Leonard and Sheldon. The three of us came up with the guidance system.",10,Big Bang Theory,142,26
48803,Leonard,2, Hi. ,10,Big Bang Theory,5,1
48804,Sheldon,2, Hello.,10,Big Bang Theory,7,1
48805,Howard,2," And this is my friend, Raj.",10,Big Bang Theory,28,6
48806,Raj,2," Oh, I'm not on the patent. I'm just here because there's a bumblebee in my office.",10,Big Bang Theory,83,16
48807,Leonard,2, I saw it. It's big.,10,Big Bang Theory,20,5
48808,Howard,2," Anyway, like I said in the e-mail, this meeting's on Thursday. Do you have any advice for us?",10,Big Bang Theory,94,18
48810,Sheldon,2," Don't sign anything? That's your advice? Okay, so, uh, if during this meeting, one of us were to, say, complete an oil painting, you'd recommend that we leave that unsigned?",10,Big Bang Theory,174,30
48812,Sheldon,2, That's what you said.,10,Big Bang Theory,22,4
48814,Sheldon,2," This must be how you practice law in Boca Raton, by saying things you don't mean and meaning things you don't say.",10,Big Bang Theory,115,22
48816,Howard,2," Marty, let me call you back.",10,Big Bang Theory,29,6
48817,Leonard,2," Someday, when I'm up on murder charges, you'll be hearing from me.",10,Big Bang Theory,67,12
48818,Sheldon,2, You don't need him. I'll represent you.,10,Big Bang Theory,40,7
48820,Penny,2, Hi.,10,Big Bang Theory,4,1
48822,Penny,2," Oh, had to go to a sales seminar on our new sleeping pill.",10,Big Bang Theory,59,13
48824,Penny,2, Great.,10,Big Bang Theory,7,1
48826,Penny,2," In, like, two minutes. Yeah. So, how is everything going around here? Are you still upset about people finding out you're pregnant?",10,Big Bang Theory,132,22
48828,Penny,2," Sure, sure. Uh, did you ever figure out who told?",10,Big Bang Theory,50,10
48830,Penny,2," Hmm. Well, I guess it's just gonna remain a mystery, you know, like whatever happened in that seminar after they dimmed the lights.",10,Big Bang Theory,132,23
48832,Penny,2," Uh, you know, when I was in high school, there was this girl who was talking about me behind my back, so me and all my friends, we cornered her in the bathroom and forgave her.",10,Big Bang Theory,177,36
48834,Penny,2," Okay, all right, honey, you know what? There was something I was too scared to tell you yesterday, and now I'm just balls-out terrified to tell you, but the truth is it wasn't Barbara Chen, it was me. I'm the reason everyone knows.",10,Big Bang Theory,232,43
48836,Penny,2," Well, it was an accident.I am so sorry I lied.",10,Big Bang Theory,47,10
48838,Penny,2," Oh, you know, I also lied about the girl in the bathroom. Yeah, we actually dumped her retainer in the toilet and put it back in her mouth.",10,Big Bang Theory,140,28
48840,Sheldon,2, I don't understand why I can't talk at this meeting.,10,Big Bang Theory,53,10
48841,Leonard,2," â€˜Cause when you talk, it enrages people.",10,Big Bang Theory,43,7
48842,Sheldon,2, Okay. Quick question. Am I allowed to exchange pleasantries upon meeting this colonel?,10,Big Bang Theory,87,13
48843,Leonard,2, Yes.,10,Big Bang Theory,5,1
48844,Sheldon,2, Am I allowed to inform him that Colonel Sanders was never actually in the military?,10,Big Bang Theory,84,15
48845,Leonard,2, I'm getting enraged.,10,Big Bang Theory,21,3
48846,Sheldon,2, Fine. Ooh. Can I use text-to-speech software?,10,Big Bang Theory,46,7
48847,Howard,2, No.,10,Big Bang Theory,4,1
48848,Leonard,2, Don't speak.,10,Big Bang Theory,13,2
48851,Leonard,2, Hi.,10,Big Bang Theory,4,1
48852,Howard,2, Hello.,10,Big Bang Theory,7,1
48854,Howard,2," It's a group effort, but I guess if we had to pick a main brain, it would be me.",10,Big Bang Theory,81,19
48855,Sheldon,2,  ,10,Big Bang Theory,2,0
48858,Leonard,2," Exactly. Yeah, you have a good grasp of the physics.",10,Big Bang Theory,53,10
48860,Howard,2, Really? You're a physicist?,10,Big Bang Theory,28,4
48862,Leonard,2, Where did you go to school?,10,Big Bang Theory,28,6
48864,Howard,2," Oh. Well, hey, me, too.",10,Big Bang Theory,24,5
48866,Howard,2," Well, thanks, but you should know we're a little concerned about this being used in weapons.",10,Big Bang Theory,93,16
48868,Leonard,2, I don't know how I feel about this.,10,Big Bang Theory,36,8
48870,Leonard,2, That's a lot less big.,10,Big Bang Theory,23,5
48872,Howard,2, I'm not even sure that's possible.,10,Big Bang Theory,35,6
48874,Howard,2, Four months?,10,Big Bang Theory,13,2
48875,Sheldon,2," Yeah, we'll do it in two. Hi. I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper. I'm the actual brains behind this project. Also, engineers aren't real scientists, MIT's a trade school, and the Death Star is from Star Wars, not Star Trek. But otherwise, thank you for your service.",10,Big Bang Theory,255,45
48877,Amy,2," Hi. Howard told me you were working late, so I brought dinner.",10,Big Bang Theory,63,12
48879,Amy,2, I spent my day alone in the lab waiting for a rat to die of anthrax.,10,Big Bang Theory,69,16
48881,Amy,2," Well, I came to see how you were feeling, but I'm guessing still angry?",10,Big Bang Theory,72,14
48883,Amy,2, You really think they're gonna start treating you differently?,10,Big Bang Theory,63,9
48885,Amy,2, I am really regretting that I got you a Happy Meal.,10,Big Bang Theory,52,11
48887,Amy,2, I understand how you feel.,10,Big Bang Theory,27,5
48889,Amy,2, I wish there were some way I could make it better.,10,Big Bang Theory,51,11
48891,Amy,2," Uh, actually, I got you apple slices 'cause you're pregnant.",10,Big Bang Theory,61,10
48893,Amy,2, I'll be right back.,10,Big Bang Theory,20,4
48896,Penny,2, Hi.,10,Big Bang Theory,4,1
48897,Sheldon,2, Hello.,10,Big Bang Theory,7,1
48898,Penny,2, What are you doing?,10,Big Bang Theory,20,4
48899,Sheldon,2," Oh, Leonard's mad at me, so I'm making him lemon bars.",10,Big Bang Theory,55,11
48900,Penny,2, Does he even like lemon bars?,10,Big Bang Theory,30,6
48901,Sheldon,2," Not really. But I'm mad at him, too, so lemon bars it is.",10,Big Bang Theory,58,13
48902,Penny,2, Something happen at the meeting?,10,Big Bang Theory,33,5
48903,Sheldon,2, They made me promise I wouldn't talk.,10,Big Bang Theory,38,7
48904,Penny,2, And you talked?,10,Big Bang Theory,16,3
48905,Sheldon,2," Well, now, see? You knew what was gonna happen. Why didn't they? Anyway, now we're committed to completing this project in a ridiculously short time frame, and everyone's upset with me.",10,Big Bang Theory,186,31
48906,Penny,2," Well, if it makes you feel any better, Bernadette's mad at me, too.",10,Big Bang Theory,68,13
48907,Sheldon,2," Mm. If it makes you feel any better, a parasitoid wasp known as Oobius depressus has been rediscovered after 101 years of presumed extinction.",10,Big Bang Theory,143,24
48908,Penny,2, Why would that make me feel better?,10,Big Bang Theory,36,7
48909,Sheldon,2, Why would your Bernadette thing make me feel better? At least mine was educational.,10,Big Bang Theory,84,14
48910,Penny,2, Okay. Never mind.,10,Big Bang Theory,18,3
48911,Sheldon,2," Look, I'm sorry. Tell me why Bernadette is upset with you.",10,Big Bang Theory,59,11
48912,Penny,2," Well, I told people at work that she's pregnant. She wasn't ready for them to know.",10,Big Bang Theory,84,16
48913,Sheldon,2, Why would you do that?,10,Big Bang Theory,23,5
48914,Penny,2," Well, it just slipped out. I feel terrible.",10,Big Bang Theory,44,8
48915,Sheldon,2," See, that's exactly what happened to me, except that I said it on purpose, and I have no regrets.",10,Big Bang Theory,98,19
48917,Raj,2, Is it even possible to get this done in two months?,10,Big Bang Theory,52,11
48918,Howard,2," Well, maybe. I don't know. We'll have to work 12 hours a day, seven days a week.",10,Big Bang Theory,81,17
48919,Leonard,2," Which means I won't be able to make Penny breakfast every day, and she'll realize my brioche French toast was the only thing keeping her in the marriage.",10,Big Bang Theory,154,28
48920,Howard,2, I love your French toast.,10,Big Bang Theory,26,5
48921,Leonard,2," Oh, thanks, man. ",10,Big Bang Theory,18,3
48922,Raj,2," So, why did you guys even agree to the deadline?",10,Big Bang Theory,49,10
48923,Howard,2, We didn't. Sheldon did.,10,Big Bang Theory,24,4
48924,Raj,2, And you just let him?,10,Big Bang Theory,22,5
48925,Leonard,2," Well, the colonel said it was for the good of the country, and the funding is substantial.",10,Big Bang Theory,91,17
48926,Howard,2," No, but mostly, there was an awkward pause, and I broke it by saying okay.",10,Big Bang Theory,75,15
48927,Raj,2, So I guess I won't be seeing you guys for a while.,10,Big Bang Theory,51,12
48928,Leonard,2," Oh, looks like it.",10,Big Bang Theory,19,4
48929,Raj,2," Wow. You're going off to work with the military, leaving me behind. Now I know how all those army wives feel.",10,Big Bang Theory,110,21
48930,Howard,2, Would you stop? We're just gonna be on the other side of campus.,10,Big Bang Theory,65,13
48931,Raj,2, And right here.,10,Big Bang Theory,16,3
48932,Howard,2, You are a deeply silly man.,10,Big Bang Theory,28,6
48933,Raj,2, He is so afraid of his feelings.,10,Big Bang Theory,33,7
48935,Penny,2," Oh, hi.",10,Big Bang Theory,8,2
48937,Penny,2," Yeah, come on in.",10,Big Bang Theory,18,4
48939,Penny,2," Oh, thank you, and I'm sorry I lied about it. ",10,Big Bang Theory,47,10
48941,Penny,2," Oh, that's what Amy said. So what's going on with the research project? Are they gonna let you run it?",10,Big Bang Theory,103,20
48943,Penny,2, You threatened to sue?,10,Big Bang Theory,23,4
48945,Penny,2, That's funny. I learned something totally different.,10,Big Bang Theory,53,7
48947,Penny,2," Oh, that's so beautiful.",10,Big Bang Theory,25,4
48950,Sheldon,2, I never realized this building was classified.,10,Big Bang Theory,47,7
48951,Howard,2, Maybe that's because it's classified.,10,Big Bang Theory,38,5
48952,Leonard,2, Wish we weren't so far from my parking space.,10,Big Bang Theory,46,9
48953,Sheldon,2," The way you put away those lemon bars, perhaps that's a good thing.",10,Big Bang Theory,68,13
48954,Leonard,2, I'd like to reinstate the you-not-talking rule.,10,Big Bang Theory,48,7
48955,Sheldon,2, Why? It clearly doesn't work.,10,Big Bang Theory,30,5
48956,Howard,2, I guess this is it. ,10,Big Bang Theory,21,5
48957,Leonard,2, Is that a retinal scanner?,10,Big Bang Theory,27,5
48958,Howard,2, Let's find out.,10,Big Bang Theory,16,3
48960,Leonard,2, No way.,10,Big Bang Theory,8,2
48961,Sheldon,2, Impressive.,10,Big Bang Theory,12,1
48962,Leonard,2," Oh, my turn, my turn.",10,Big Bang Theory,22,5
48964,Leonard,2, I didn't even have to take my glasses off/,10,Big Bang Theory,43,9
48967,Howard,2," Oh, oh, oh, oh, guys, hold me upside down.",10,Big Bang Theory,43,9
48971,Howard,3, It's pretty late. You think I've got time to run some more simulations on the cooling system?,10,Big Bang Theory,94,17
48972,Leonard,3," Sure, I'm still figuring out the thermo-acoustic expander.",10,Big Bang Theory,59,8
48973,Sheldon,3," Oh, while you do that I am going to pump cerebral spinal fluid through my brain cells to remove the metabolic by-products of the day's thoughts.",10,Big Bang Theory,145,26
48974,Howard,3, What?,10,Big Bang Theory,6,1
48975,Sheldon,3," It's called sleep and it's my bedtime. Nighty-night, y'all.",10,Big Bang Theory,60,9
48976,Howard,3," Hey, hey, hey, you're not going anywhere.",10,Big Bang Theory,42,7
48977,Leonard,3, We only have two months to deliver this to the Air Force because of you.,10,Big Bang Theory,73,15
48978,Sheldon,3," I know, I was there.",10,Big Bang Theory,21,5
48979,Howard,3," Well, wake up, we're gonna put in a lot of late nights.",10,Big Bang Theory,56,12
48980,Sheldon,3, How late?,10,Big Bang Theory,10,2
48981,Howard,3," Well, I don't know, midnight, one.",10,Big Bang Theory,35,6
48982,Sheldon,3, One o'clock? I'm not a raccoon.,10,Big Bang Theory,32,6
48983,Howard,3," If you're tired, have some coffee.",10,Big Bang Theory,35,6
48984,Sheldon,3, What? You have some coffee.,10,Big Bang Theory,28,5
48985,Howard,3, I am having coffee.,10,Big Bang Theory,20,4
48986,Sheldon,3, And look how irritable it's making you!,10,Big Bang Theory,40,7
48987,Leonard,3," Guys, we're not gonna get anything done if we start fighting. Now, can you please try",10,Big Bang Theory,86,16
48988,Sheldon,3, Fine.  I don't think I can go much longer.,10,Big Bang Theory,43,9
48989,Leonard,3," It's been three and a half minutes, wake up.",10,Big Bang Theory,45,9
48991,Sheldon,3, I had a bad dream that my best friend became a tyrant and forced me to stay up all night to work.,10,Big Bang Theory,98,22
48992,Leonard,3," Oh, I had a good dream that when I carried you to bed, I let your head hit the wall and I laughed.",10,Big Bang Theory,99,23
48993,Penny,3, Good morning.,10,Big Bang Theory,14,2
48994,Leonard,3, What is this?,10,Big Bang Theory,14,3
48995,Amy,3," Well, we didn't see you last night, we're not gonna see you today, so we thought we could have breakfast together.",10,Big Bang Theory,115,21
48996,Leonard,3," Oh, that is so nice.",10,Big Bang Theory,21,5
48997,Sheldon,3," Ow, it does hurt.",10,Big Bang Theory,18,4
48998,Leonard,3," So, what are you guys gonna do today?",10,Big Bang Theory,38,8
48999,Amy,3," Well, Sheldon was supposed to go to this party with me this afternoon, but I don't think that's happening.",10,Big Bang Theory,107,19
49000,Sheldon,3," Oh, that was never happening.",10,Big Bang Theory,30,5
49001,Penny,3," Oh, I'll go. I like a party.",10,Big Bang Theory,29,7
49002,Amy,3," Well, to be honest, it's not like a party party, it's more like a gathering where scientists of different disciplines get together to share their work and keep current on what's going on in other fields. I don't know why I called it a party, sorry.",10,Big Bang Theory,249,46
49003,Penny,3," It's okay, I'll still go.",10,Big Bang Theory,26,5
49004,Leonard,3, You don't think you'll be bored?,10,Big Bang Theory,33,6
49005,Penny,3," Oh, I'll have some wine and listen to people go on about crap I don't understand. I mean, how is it any different than every single day of my life?",10,Big Bang Theory,148,30
49006,Sheldon,3, I won't be there.,10,Big Bang Theory,18,4
49008,Howard,3, Sorry I have to work all weekend.,10,Big Bang Theory,34,7
49010,Howard,3, Thanks again for breakfast.,10,Big Bang Theory,28,4
49011,Raj,3," Well, I didn't get to see you last night. It was the least I could do.",10,Big Bang Theory,71,16
49013,Raj,3," So, what should we do today?",10,Big Bang Theory,29,6
49015,Raj,3," Well, I don't mind. Oh, you want go to the mall and look at baby stuff?",10,Big Bang Theory,72,16
49017,Raj,3," Oh, come on, we could share a pretzel and get sideways glances from racist old ladies.",10,Big Bang Theory,87,16
49019,Raj,3," Oh, I know, why don't we get started on clearing out the baby's room?",10,Big Bang Theory,70,14
49021,Raj,3, You have to get to it eventually.,10,Big Bang Theory,34,7
49023,Raj,3, How can you be embarrassed around me? I'm gonna be in the room with you when you give birth.,10,Big Bang Theory,93,19
49025,Raj,3," You didn't think I was gonna be in your kitchen this morning, yet here I am.",10,Big Bang Theory,77,16
49028,Sheldon,3," Huh, what?",10,Big Bang Theory,11,2
49030,Sheldon,3," Oh, no, thank you, those have caffeine in them.",10,Big Bang Theory,48,9
49032,Sheldon,3," I am cool. This is Yoo-hoo, chocolate milk's delicious watery cousin.",10,Big Bang Theory,70,11
49034,Sheldon,3, Superheroes take performance-enhancing chemicals?,10,Big Bang Theory,50,4
49036,Sheldon,3, I am facing a great deal of work. And I do like things better when famous people also like them.,10,Big Bang Theory,97,20
49038,Sheldon,3," The first one's free? Flash, how do you stay in business?",10,Big Bang Theory,58,11
49041,Amy,3," Hi, Bert. This is my friend, Penny.",10,Big Bang Theory,36,7
49042,Penny,3, Hi.,10,Big Bang Theory,4,1
49044,Amy,3, Bert's a geologist. ,10,Big Bang Theory,21,3
49046,Penny,3, How early are we?,10,Big Bang Theory,18,4
49047,Amy,3," Oh, actually, we're an hour late.",10,Big Bang Theory,34,6
49048,Penny,3, I suddenly wish Sheldon was here.,10,Big Bang Theory,34,6
49051,Raj,3," Well, in The Sound of Music, Julie Andrews says let's start at the very beginning, a very good place to start.",10,Big Bang Theory,111,21
49053,Raj,3," Well, I think the first thing we should get rid of is that tone.",10,Big Bang Theory,65,14
49055,Raj,3," Oh, that's a nice one. Was it yours when you were little?",10,Big Bang Theory,58,12
49057,Raj,3," Wow, it's so cute.",10,Big Bang Theory,19,4
49059,Raj,3," Oh, and did they have kids?",10,Big Bang Theory,28,6
49061,Raj,3," Yeah, that's not worrisome at all.",10,Big Bang Theory,35,6
49063,Raj,3, I skipped spin class for this.,10,Big Bang Theory,31,6
49065,Howard,3, Why is it taking him so long to get a drink out of a vending machine?,10,Big Bang Theory,70,16
49066,Leonard,3," Oh, it's complicated. He finds pushing that little door and reaching up into the machine",10,Big Bang Theory,89,15
49067,Sheldon,3," Gentlemen, I am ready to work. To quote The Martian, let's science the faeces out of this. That's The Martian the book and The Martian the movie, not Marvin the Martian. Although to quote Marvin the Martian, I claim this planet in the name of Mars.",10,Big Bang Theory,249,46
49068,Leonard,3, Are you okay?,10,Big Bang Theory,14,3
49069,Sheldon,3," Oh, I'm fantastic, never been better. I had my first energy drink and I feel great. Hey, you guys want to wrestle? We can do arm, thumb, mud, sumo. Nah, we're not fat enough, or wearing diapers.",10,Big Bang Theory,195,37
49070,Howard,3, You wanted him awake.,10,Big Bang Theory,22,4
49072,Penny,3, So should we talk to each other or mingle?,10,Big Bang Theory,43,9
49073,Amy,3, I don't know where everyone is.,10,Big Bang Theory,32,6
49074,Penny,3," Yeah, I mean, I could see him eating one or two guests, but not a whole party.",10,Big Bang Theory,79,17
49076,Amy,3, Okay. I feel so bad about leaving him here.,10,Big Bang Theory,44,9
49077,Penny,3," Oh, it's funny, I was just thinking the same thing about you.",10,Big Bang Theory,62,12
49079,Penny,3," Wait, what do you mean she's her?",10,Big Bang Theory,34,7
49081,Penny,3, No.,10,Big Bang Theory,4,1
49082,Amy,3, No.,10,Big Bang Theory,4,1
49084,Penny,3," What? You tell me about your foot fungus, but this is a secret?",10,Big Bang Theory,64,13
49085,Amy,3, I'm sure it's just 'cause I'm dating Sheldon.,10,Big Bang Theory,46,8
49087,Penny,3, Now Sheldon's popular? What is happening?,10,Big Bang Theory,42,6
49089,Howard,3, Maybe we should break for lunch. What time is it?,10,Big Bang Theory,50,10
49090,Leonard,3," According to the world's worst cuckoo clock, it's two.",10,Big Bang Theory,55,9
49091,Sheldon,3, My head hurts and I'm more tired than ever.,10,Big Bang Theory,44,9
49092,Howard,3, Why don't you just go home?,10,Big Bang Theory,28,6
49093,Sheldon,3," No, I can do this. I just, I just need another energy drink. Oh, no.",10,Big Bang Theory,69,15
49094,Leonard,3, What?,10,Big Bang Theory,6,1
49095,Sheldon,3, I want another one.,10,Big Bang Theory,20,4
49096,Leonard,3, So?,10,Big Bang Theory,4,1
49097,Sheldon,3, That's a craving. That's a sign of chemical dependency.,10,Big Bang Theory,56,9
49098,Leonard,3, You only had one.,10,Big Bang Theory,18,4
49099,Sheldon,3," No, I know, but plenty of things are addictive after a single exposure. I mean, crack cocaine, nicotine, Pringles. You know once one pops one just can't stop.",10,Big Bang Theory,159,28
49100,Howard,3, You can't develop a problem that fast.,10,Big Bang Theory,39,7
49101,Sheldon,3," You want to bet? Oh, great, now I'm addicted to gambling.",10,Big Bang Theory,58,11
49102,Leonard,3, We can't afford to lose any more time.,10,Big Bang Theory,39,8
49103,Howard,3," Well, this probably won't work, but has anyone ever tried to just haul off and whup the crazy out of him?",10,Big Bang Theory,106,21
49104,Leonard,3," That's not helpful. It's fun to think about, but it's not helpful. Hey, Sheldon, we are on a serious time crunch. We can't do this without you. Can you please pull it together?",10,Big Bang Theory,177,33
49105,Sheldon,3," I'm sorry. Yes, of course.",10,Big Bang Theory,27,5
49106,Leonard,3, Thank you.,10,Big Bang Theory,11,2
49107,Sheldon,3," Just, please, bear with me if I display symptoms of caffeine withdrawal.",10,Big Bang Theory,73,12
49108,Howard,3, No worries.,10,Big Bang Theory,12,2
49109,Sheldon,3, You guys stink.,10,Big Bang Theory,16,3
49112,Raj,3," I think you were mean before you were pregnant, but it's fine. So, uh, instead of cleaning out the room, why don't we just decide on a theme for the nursery?",10,Big Bang Theory,158,31
49114,Raj,3, Of course it does. Didn't your baby room have a theme?,10,Big Bang Theory,55,11
49116,Raj,3," Oh. Mine was Winnie the Pooh. But anyway, why don't we just take a step back and start with a colour? Right? There are so many amazing ones. Red, blue, green, purple.",10,Big Bang Theory,167,32
49118,Raj,3," Well, not now.",10,Big Bang Theory,15,3
49120,Raj,3," Okay, well, I'm just trying to help you.",10,Big Bang Theory,41,8
49122,Raj,3, Sorry. Sorry.,10,Big Bang Theory,14,2
49125,Penny,3, You trend setter.,10,Big Bang Theory,18,3
49126,Amy,3, Just the right idea at the right time.,10,Big Bang Theory,39,8
49127,Penny,3," Okay, okay, so Amy's cool, Sheldon's cool. Tell me about Leonard.",10,Big Bang Theory,66,11
49129,Penny,3, Leonard Hofstadter.,10,Big Bang Theory,20,2
49131,Penny,3," That's me, I'm her. You know, he didn't trick me, he just wore me down.",10,Big Bang Theory,72,15
49133,Amy,3, And you thought this wasn't gonna be a great party.,10,Big Bang Theory,52,10
49134,Penny,3," You know, I had no idea Caltech is exactly like my high school.",10,Big Bang Theory,64,13
49135,Amy,3," Well, it's not exactly like it. We're all extremely smart.",10,Big Bang Theory,59,10
49136,Penny,3," Wow, you popular girls are mean.",10,Big Bang Theory,33,6
49138,Leonard,3, I'm gonna get some coffee. You want some?,10,Big Bang Theory,42,8
49139,Sheldon,3," Uh, you're really going to have caffeine in front of me when I'm trying to get my life back on track?",10,Big Bang Theory,102,21
49140,Leonard,3," Uh, okay, let's pretend you do have a problem.",10,Big Bang Theory,47,9
49141,Sheldon,3, I do.,10,Big Bang Theory,6,2
49142,Leonard,3, You don't.,10,Big Bang Theory,11,2
49143,Sheldon,3," Yeah, but I do.",10,Big Bang Theory,16,4
49144,Leonard,3," No, you don't. But let's say you do. And don't say you do, because you don't. Now, wouldn't you think that throwing yourself into your work would be the best way to deal with it?",10,Big Bang Theory,179,35
49145,Sheldon,3, With what?,10,Big Bang Theory,11,2
49146,Leonard,3, Your problem.,10,Big Bang Theory,14,2
49147,Sheldon,3, I thought I didn't have a problem.,10,Big Bang Theory,35,7
49148,Howard,3, That was painful to watch.,10,Big Bang Theory,27,5
49150,Raj,3, So where are we going?,10,Big Bang Theory,23,5
49152,Raj,3, Okay. How Thelma and Louise of us.,10,Big Bang Theory,35,7
49154,Raj,3, I'm sorry?,10,Big Bang Theory,11,2
49156,Raj,3," Well, crime-scene photos near your crib spring to mind.",10,Big Bang Theory,56,9
49158,Raj,3," Bernadette, come on, look, you're overthinking this, okay? You're gonna be an amazing mom. Even if you don't believe it, I know you have maternal instincts.",10,Big Bang Theory,157,26
49160,Raj,3," Happy and well-fed. You see, that's what I'm taking from that story.",10,Big Bang Theory,69,12
49162,Sheldon,3," Leonard, can I ask you a question?",10,Big Bang Theory,35,7
49163,Leonard,3, Is it about the rotational symmetries you should be figuring out or your fake caffeine problem?,10,Big Bang Theory,96,16
49164,Sheldon,3," Howard, can I ask you a question?",10,Big Bang Theory,34,7
49165,Howard,3, No.,10,Big Bang Theory,4,1
49166,Sheldon,3," All right, I'll just toss this out to the room. Um, I was thinking that the best way to fight my addiction is by weaning myself off in steps. Now, I couldn't find a caffeine patch, but I did find what claims to be a mind-boosting caffeine suppository. You know, the interesting fact about the rectum",10,Big Bang Theory,300,56
49167,Leonard,3," Sheldon. We are dealing with an impossible deadline from the Air Force because of you. So have an energy drink, don't have an energy drink. Order suppositories and shove 'em wherever you want, I don't care.",10,Big Bang Theory,207,36
49168,Sheldon,3, You don't shove them. They come with an easy-glide applicator.,10,Big Bang Theory,63,10
49169,Leonard,3, Right. Listen to me. We can't do anything until you do your part. So get up in front of this whiteboard and do it.,10,Big Bang Theory,115,24
49170,Sheldon,3, I can't.,10,Big Bang Theory,9,2
49171,Leonard,3," Yes, you can.",10,Big Bang Theory,14,3
49172,Sheldon,3," No, I can't figure out the math. I've been racking my brain for days, and I've got nothing.",10,Big Bang Theory,92,18
49173,Leonard,3, Seriously?,10,Big Bang Theory,11,1
49174,Sheldon,3, I can't do it. I'm not as smart as I think I am. I'm so sorry. This is all my fault.,10,Big Bang Theory,85,21
49175,Leonard,3," It's okay, we'll figure something out.",10,Big Bang Theory,39,6
49176,Sheldon,3, But what if we can't?,10,Big Bang Theory,22,5
49177,Leonard,3, It'll be fine. You'll see. Sheldon? Buddy? ,10,Big Bang Theory,44,7
49178,Howard,3," When the baby gets here, you gotta teach me that.",10,Big Bang Theory,50,10
49179,Amy,3," Thank you so much, Bert. This was great.",10,Big Bang Theory,41,8
49181,Amy,3, I think we're good.,10,Big Bang Theory,20,4
49183,Penny,3," Well, so are you. In fact, you know what? We will never take you for granite. Did you get that? Granite? A little geology joke.",10,Big Bang Theory,128,25
49185,Penny,3, Okay.,10,Big Bang Theory,6,1
49186,Amy,3, Bye.,10,Big Bang Theory,5,1
49188,Raj,3," Uh, pull over.",10,Big Bang Theory,15,3
49190,Raj,3," Whoa, I'm calling my dad, okay? He's got experience dealing with pregnant ladies because he's an OBGYN. And experience with crazy ladies because of my mom.",10,Big Bang Theory,156,26
49192,Raj,3, What? No.,10,Big Bang Theory,10,2
49194,Raj,3, No.,10,Big Bang Theory,4,1
49196,Raj,3," This is my friend, Bernadette. She's pregnant, and she's a bit worried, so I thought maybe you could talk to her.",10,Big Bang Theory,114,21
49203,Raj,3, Well I don't.,10,Big Bang Theory,14,3
49206,Leonard,3," Um, I don't really know how to say this.",10,Big Bang Theory,41,9
49208,Leonard,3," Right. Sorry, sir.",10,Big Bang Theory,19,3
49209,Sheldon,3," He said start with it, not end with it.",10,Big Bang Theory,40,9
49210,Leonard,3, Sir.,10,Big Bang Theory,5,1
49212,Howard,3, We've hit a bit of a snag. We're already behind schedule.,10,Big Bang Theory,58,11
49213,Sheldon,3, The computations required to overcome the deployability issues are more significant than we thought.,10,Big Bang Theory,101,14
49214,Leonard,3," I understand that we're under contract, and I don't know what the consequences of violating that are, but, uh, we're not gonna be able to deliver in the time we promised.",10,Big Bang Theory,171,31
49216,Howard,3," We, we're thinking, two years.",10,Big Bang Theory,31,5
49218,Howard,3, That's it? You're okay with that?,10,Big Bang Theory,34,6
49220,Leonard,3," Thanks for understanding, sir.",10,Big Bang Theory,31,4
49221,Howard,3," Yes, thank you so much.",10,Big Bang Theory,24,5
49222,Sheldon,3," We, we really appreciate it.",10,Big Bang Theory,29,5
49223,Leonard,3," All right, pressure's off",10,Big Bang Theory,26,4
49224,Howard,3, Wanna see a movie?,10,Big Bang Theory,19,4
49225,Sheldon,3, Popcorn's on me.,10,Big Bang Theory,17,3
49227,Amy,4," And there was water everywhere, it was such a mess.",10,Big Bang Theory,52,10
49228,Leonard,4, That stinks. How long are you out of the apartment?,10,Big Bang Theory,52,10
49229,Amy,4, About five weeks.,10,Big Bang Theory,18,3
49230,Penny,4," Ugh, did you lose anything valuable?",10,Big Bang Theory,37,6
49231,Amy,4," Well, the pipe was over my closet, so all my clothes are gone.",10,Big Bang Theory,63,13
49232,Penny,4," Oh, so nothing. Great. Do they know why the pipe burst?",10,Big Bang Theory,56,11
49233,Amy,4, They didn't say.,10,Big Bang Theory,17,3
49234,Leonard,4, Buildings that have a combination of copper and galvanized steel are susceptible to pinholes and corrosion caused by the mobility of ions in the water. Can't have your head shoved in a toilet as much as I did and not pick up a few things about plumbing.,10,Big Bang Theory,254,47
49235,Penny,4," Well, if you need a place to crash, you can stay with us.",10,Big Bang Theory,58,13
49236,Amy,4, Really?,10,Big Bang Theory,8,1
49237,Penny,4," Of course. You can stay in Leonard's room, and we'll stay at my place.",10,Big Bang Theory,71,14
49238,Amy,4, You're sure that's not an inconvenience?,10,Big Bang Theory,41,6
49239,Penny,4," No, not at all.",10,Big Bang Theory,16,4
49240,Leonard,4," And we live with Sheldon, so the word inconvenience has really lost all meaning.",10,Big Bang Theory,81,14
49241,Amy,4," So, technically, I'd be moving in with my boyfriend?",10,Big Bang Theory,53,9
49242,Penny,4, I guess so. And I'd finally get to live alone with my husband.,10,Big Bang Theory,63,13
49243,Amy,4," Oh, my, this is a big step.",10,Big Bang Theory,28,7
49244,Leonard,4," Mm-hmm. For two of us, it's in the right direction.",10,Big Bang Theory,52,10
49245,Sheldon,4, Why are you all smiling like crazy people?,10,Big Bang Theory,43,8
49247,Sheldon,4, Cohabitation with my girlfriend? That's a great deal to process.,10,Big Bang Theory,65,10
49248,Leonard,4, It's only for five weeks.,10,Big Bang Theory,26,5
49249,Penny,4," Yeah, and we'll be right across the hall.",10,Big Bang Theory,42,8
49250,Amy,4, What do you think?,10,Big Bang Theory,19,4
49251,Sheldon,4, I don't know. What if living together kills the romance?,10,Big Bang Theory,57,10
49252,Penny,4," Okay, you guys had sex one whole time. Nothing can put out a fire like that.",10,Big Bang Theory,77,16
49253,Sheldon,4," Yeah, but what happens when we each get a peek behind the curtain? I mean, she's never even seen me unshaven.",10,Big Bang Theory,110,21
49254,Leonard,4, You just shaved yesterday. You're good for three months.,10,Big Bang Theory,57,9
49255,Amy,4," Sheldon, I understand your apprehension, but let me appeal to the scientist in you. Given the five-week end date, isn't it the perfect opportunity to consider this an experiment and collect data on our compatibility?",10,Big Bang Theory,217,35
49256,Sheldon,4, Don't try luring me in with sexy talk.,10,Big Bang Theory,39,8
49257,Leonard,4," Okay. Star Trek, the original series, the Enterprise was on a five-year mission to explore new worlds. Think of this as your personal five-week mission to do the same.",10,Big Bang Theory,168,29
49258,Sheldon,4," If you want to lure me in with sexy talk, that's how you do it.",10,Big Bang Theory,64,15
49259,Penny,4, Don't be proud of that.,10,Big Bang Theory,24,5
49260,Amy,4," So, is that a yes?",10,Big Bang Theory,19,5
49261,Sheldon,4," Not yet. How will I learn if I'm comfortable living with Amy or just comfortable because I'm in my own apartment? Now, if this experiment is going to be valid, I suggest a neutral environment.",10,Big Bang Theory,193,35
49262,Penny,4," Well, where would you go?",10,Big Bang Theory,26,5
49263,Sheldon,4," Well, ideally, an enclosed, self-sustaining biodome in New Mexico, where we would eat crops fertilized with our own waste. ",10,Big Bang Theory,124,19
49264,Penny,4," Wait. Why don't you guys stay across the hall, and we will live here?",10,Big Bang Theory,70,14
49265,Sheldon,4," Interesting. If my official residence were across the hall, I wonder if I'd need to knock every time I came over here.",10,Big Bang Theory,119,22
49266,Leonard,4, That's a good question. Maybe just don't come over.,10,Big Bang Theory,52,9
49267,Sheldon,4," Historically, I don't do well with change.",10,Big Bang Theory,43,7
49268,Penny,4," Okay, it won't be that bad. We wouldn't even sit in your spot while you're gone.",10,Big Bang Theory,81,16
49269,Sheldon,4," You're darn right, you wouldn't. No matter where I am, this will always be my spot. Like an embassy in a foreign country, this seat is the sovereign soil of my bottom.",10,Big Bang Theory,168,32
49270,Leonard,4, Just nod and smile. He's almost gone.,10,Big Bang Theory,38,7
49271,Amy,4," Sheldon, what do you think?",10,Big Bang Theory,28,5
49272,Sheldon,4, Very well. I'm on board.,10,Big Bang Theory,25,5
49273,Amy,4, Seriously?,10,Big Bang Theory,11,1
49274,Sheldon,4, Yes. I accept this five-week mission to share a living space with my girlfriend.,10,Big Bang Theory,81,14
49275,Amy,4, Oh. This is so exciting.,10,Big Bang Theory,25,5
49276,Sheldon,4," Well, now, don't be surprised if, like Star Trek, it's cancelled in three.",10,Big Bang Theory,75,13
49278,Raj,4," I have to say, I am happy with your OBGYN.",10,Big Bang Theory,43,10
49279,Howard,4, Cool. â€˜Cause she says you're doing a great job as weird friend who doesn't have to be at every appointment.,10,Big Bang Theory,110,20
49280,Raj,4, I'm the son of a gynaecologist. I could be helpful. ,10,Big Bang Theory,53,10
49282,Raj,4," The polite response is, thank you for noticing.",10,Big Bang Theory,48,8
49284,Howard,4," Yeah, we could name him Blobert.",10,Big Bang Theory,33,6
49286,Howard,4, Bloberta. Or Blobbi with an I.,10,Big Bang Theory,31,6
49288,Howard,4," Yeah, I was just thinking the same thing.",10,Big Bang Theory,42,8
49289,Raj,4," If you want, you can find out right now.",10,Big Bang Theory,41,9
49290,Howard,4, Mm.,10,Big Bang Theory,4,1
49292,Raj,4," Well, somebody else knows because they saw it in the folder.",10,Big Bang Theory,61,11
49294,Raj,4, It was an accident. The doctor left the folder out on her desk. It's not my fault I opened it and looked.,10,Big Bang Theory,106,22
49295,Howard,4," So you know the sex of our baby, and we don't?",10,Big Bang Theory,47,11
49296,Raj,4, Flip a coin. You got a fifty-fifty shot.,10,Big Bang Theory,41,8
49297,Howard,4, It's unbelievable.,10,Big Bang Theory,19,2
49299,Raj,4," What? This is not a problem, okay? If you don't want to know, I don't have to tell you.",10,Big Bang Theory,88,19
49301,Raj,4," Okay, well, that's a problem.",10,Big Bang Theory,30,5
49303,Penny,4," You know, I'm very proud of you for trying to live with Amy.",10,Big Bang Theory,61,13
49304,Sheldon,4, Oh. Thank you.,10,Big Bang Theory,15,3
49305,Penny,4, Mm. ,10,Big Bang Theory,5,1
49306,Sheldon,4," Of course, the ideal way to conduct this experiment would be with four pairs of identical Sheldons and Amys. One pair that was neither dating nor living together. One pair that was dating but not living together. One pair that was living together but not dating. And then, of course, one pair that was living together and dating. Although, with that many Sheldons, it'd be such a party, we'd never get anything done.",10,Big Bang Theory,417,73
49307,Penny,4," That was a cute story. So, um, what did you want to ask me?",10,Big Bang Theory,60,14
49308,Sheldon,4," Well, you've lived with your significant other for some time. I would like this experiment to go well. Are there any insights you can share?",10,Big Bang Theory,141,25
49309,Penny,4," Mm. Well, the biggie is, if she has an insane roommate, kick him out as soon as possible.",10,Big Bang Theory,90,18
49310,Sheldon,4," You know, Leonard and I were very happy before you came along.",10,Big Bang Theory,63,12
49312,Amy,4, You've been roommates with Sheldon forever. Do you have any advice?,10,Big Bang Theory,68,11
49313,Leonard,4, I'm trying to think of an answer that won't stop you from doing this. ,10,Big Bang Theory,71,14
49314,Penny,4," I know it sounds like a clichÃ©, but compromise is key. ",10,Big Bang Theory,57,11
49315,Leonard,4," Never leave a belt on the floor. At night, they look like snakes.",10,Big Bang Theory,66,13
49316,Penny,4," Do little things, like bring her a cup of coffee in bed.",10,Big Bang Theory,57,12
49317,Leonard,4, Keep M&M'S in your pocket in case you have to wait in a long line.,10,Big Bang Theory,67,15
49318,Penny,4," You're gonna be seeing each other a lot, so respect each other's personal space.",10,Big Bang Theory,81,14
49319,Leonard,4," He startles easily, so, please, no flash photography.",10,Big Bang Theory,54,8
49321,Sheldon,4, How many pairs of underwear did you pack for the move?,10,Big Bang Theory,55,11
49322,Amy,4, I don't know. I didn't count.,10,Big Bang Theory,30,6
49323,Sheldon,4, You truly are the Goofus to my Gallant.,10,Big Bang Theory,40,8
49324,Amy,4," That's me. Listen, you and I are gonna be sharing a bed. You know, this is uncharted territory for both of us. How are you feeling about that?",10,Big Bang Theory,143,28
49325,Sheldon,4," Oh, excited, concerned, a little scared. All the same emotions I feel in line at Space Mountain.",10,Big Bang Theory,97,17
49326,Amy,4," Well, if you're nervous about the sleeping arrangements, maybe we should talk about it.",10,Big Bang Theory,88,14
49327,Sheldon,4, Okay. Talk.,10,Big Bang Theory,12,2
49328,Amy,4," Well, I imagine one of your concerns might be coital expectations. ",10,Big Bang Theory,68,11
49329,Sheldon,4," Wow, no foreplay or anything, just right to it. ",10,Big Bang Theory,49,9
49330,Amy,4," Look, I know this experiment is a big step outside of your comfort zone. So why don't we take being physical off the table and maybe later on, once we're more settled in, we can revisit it.",10,Big Bang Theory,190,37
49331,Sheldon,4, You're really okay with that?,10,Big Bang Theory,30,5
49332,Amy,4," I've never lived with someone, either. This is a lot for me, too.",10,Big Bang Theory,66,13
49333,Sheldon,4," This is such a relief. Honestly, if it didn't get you all worked up, I'd kiss you right now.",10,Big Bang Theory,93,19
49334,Amy,4, Good call. Seeing your Teen Titans underwear really got my motor running.,10,Big Bang Theory,74,12
49335,Sheldon,4, I know. They probably shouldn't sell those to children.,10,Big Bang Theory,56,9
49337,Penny,4," Well, here's your key.",10,Big Bang Theory,23,4
49338,Amy,4, Thank you.,10,Big Bang Theory,11,2
49339,Sheldon,4, Enjoy having the place to yourselves.,10,Big Bang Theory,38,6
49340,Leonard,4, You enjoy your mission to boldly go where no man has gone before.,10,Big Bang Theory,66,13
49341,Sheldon,4, It's Penny's bedroom. Plenty of men have gone before.,10,Big Bang Theory,54,9
49342,Penny,4," Now, now, there's no need to make this emotional.",10,Big Bang Theory,50,9
49343,Amy,4, Shall we?,10,Big Bang Theory,10,2
49344,Sheldon,4, I guess this is it.,10,Big Bang Theory,20,5
49345,Leonard,4, You guys have fun.,10,Big Bang Theory,19,4
49346,Sheldon,4," You, too. Oh, don't forget. Tuesday the air filters need to be changed.",10,Big Bang Theory,72,13
49347,Penny,4," Yeah, you wrote it on my hand.",10,Big Bang Theory,31,7
49348,Sheldon,4," Oh. Oh, and every other day, check the water level on the avocado pit.",10,Big Bang Theory,71,14
49349,Leonard,4," I'm on it. 15 years from now, we'll make guacamole together.",10,Big Bang Theory,61,11
49350,Sheldon,4," Leonard, please, let me go.",10,Big Bang Theory,28,5
49351,Amy,4," Come on, Sheldon.",10,Big Bang Theory,18,3
49352,Sheldon,4, Oh. Bye.,10,Big Bang Theory,9,2
49353,Leonard,4, Good night.,10,Big Bang Theory,12,2
49354,Penny,4, Good night.,10,Big Bang Theory,12,2
49355,Amy,4," Well, that's it. For the next five weeks, we are officially living together.",10,Big Bang Theory,77,13
49356,Sheldon,4, I guess the experiment begins.,10,Big Bang Theory,31,5
49357,Penny,4," Wa-how, we did it.",10,Big Bang Theory,19,4
49358,Leonard,4, Yeah.,10,Big Bang Theory,6,1
49360,Sheldon,4, Which side of the bed would you prefer?,10,Big Bang Theory,40,8
49361,Amy,4, Doesn't matter to me. Your choice.,10,Big Bang Theory,35,6
49362,Sheldon,4," No, no, we're living together now, everything's equal. You know? I know that I have a tendency to be controlling, so I would rather you choose.",10,Big Bang Theory,144,26
49363,Amy,4," Well, Sheldon, I really appreciate that, but these things mean more to you than they do to me, so whatever you want.",10,Big Bang Theory,117,22
49364,Sheldon,4," Well, clearly, it's not whatever I want, because what I want is for you to make this decision, and you refuse to do that.",10,Big Bang Theory,122,24
49365,Amy,4," Well, I'm not refusing. I'm just trying to be considerate.",10,Big Bang Theory,59,10
49366,Sheldon,4," Like when you let me get those shoes with the wheels on the bottom, and then watched me roll right into traffic?",10,Big Bang Theory,113,22
49367,Amy,4," Sheldon, will you please just pick a side?",10,Big Bang Theory,43,8
49368,Sheldon,4," Fine. Okay. Now, on this side, I am closer to the exit in case of emergency.",10,Big Bang Theory,77,16
49369,Amy,4, Great. That's your side.,10,Big Bang Theory,25,4
49370,Sheldon,4," No, but I'm also closer to the entrance in case of attack.",10,Big Bang Theory,59,12
49371,Amy,4," Okay, I'll take that side.",10,Big Bang Theory,27,5
49372,Sheldon,4," Ah, then again, what are the odds of someone attacking me?",10,Big Bang Theory,59,11
49373,Amy,4, Rising rapidly.,10,Big Bang Theory,16,2
49374,Sheldon,4," Now, this side offers me proximity to the bathroom, but I am closer to the window where perverts can watch me sleep.",10,Big Bang Theory,117,22
49375,Amy,4, Okay. What if we do this?,10,Big Bang Theory,26,6
49376,Sheldon,4, I suppose that works.,10,Big Bang Theory,22,4
49377,Amy,4, Great.,10,Big Bang Theory,7,1
49378,Sheldon,4, Although now I'm kind of worried someone's hiding behind those drapes.,10,Big Bang Theory,71,11
49381,Howard,4, I don't know. Maybe the surprise will make it more fun. Like magic tricks. Remember how disappointed you were when I explained the never-ending hanky?,10,Big Bang Theory,151,25
49383,Howard,4, But how delightful was it when I pulled out a bouquet at the end of those scarves? It'll be the same thing when the doctor pulls a beautiful surprise out of you.,10,Big Bang Theory,162,32
49385,Howard,4," But you didn't listen, and presto change-o, my baby's inside you. Ta-da.",10,Big Bang Theory,73,12
49387,Amy,4, Ugh. What is that?  Why did you switch sides?,10,Big Bang Theory,46,9
49388,Sheldon,4, Be grateful I'm still in the room.,10,Big Bang Theory,35,7
49389,Amy,4, Comfy?,10,Big Bang Theory,7,1
49390,Sheldon,4," Oh, I'm just happy I don't know what this memory foam remembers.",10,Big Bang Theory,65,12
49391,Amy,4," Sheldon? I know we took coitus off the table, but I was wondering how you feel about other forms of intimacy, such as snuggling.",10,Big Bang Theory,129,24
49392,Sheldon,4," Well, it's funny you should ask, because I was wondering how you'd feel about separating the two of us with a pillow wall.",10,Big Bang Theory,123,23
49393,Amy,4," Sheldon, I've made more than enough accommodations for you. We're both grown adults, we've been far more intimate than this. If you don't want to snuggle, fine, but we're not building a pillow wall.",10,Big Bang Theory,199,34
49394,Sheldon,4," Okay, well, I am sorry. I'm just worried that my sensitivity to temperature could make this a rough night. And no offence, but your bottom radiates enough heat, I'm surprised there aren't iguanas lying on it.",10,Big Bang Theory,209,36
49396,Leonard,4," That's it. It's Sheldon's bedtime, he is in for the night.",10,Big Bang Theory,59,11
49397,Penny,4, Wow. I cannot believe we are alone in our own apartment.,10,Big Bang Theory,57,11
49398,Leonard,4," It's weird. This must be how parents feel when their kid goes off to college. Unless they feel sad, then it's different.",10,Big Bang Theory,121,22
49399,Penny,4," So, what do you want to do?",10,Big Bang Theory,28,7
49400,Leonard,4, I know exactly what we are gonna do.,10,Big Bang Theory,37,8
49401,Penny,4," Really? You're a genius, and that's the first thing you come up with?",10,Big Bang Theory,70,13
49402,Leonard,4," Hey, Sheldon's not here, so we are going to put on music and dance in our underwear.",10,Big Bang Theory,85,17
49403,Penny,4, Ugh. Can we just have sex?,10,Big Bang Theory,27,6
49404,Leonard,4," Oh, don't worry. Once you see my sweet moves, sex is inevitable.",10,Big Bang Theory,65,12
49405,Penny,4," Inevitable, you say?",10,Big Bang Theory,21,3
49406,Leonard,4, I'll just let my hips do the talkin'.,10,Big Bang Theory,38,8
49408,Howard,4, Screw it. I'm calling and finding out.,10,Big Bang Theory,39,7
49410,Howard,4, But you just said you wanted to know.,10,Big Bang Theory,38,8
49412,Raj,4, Hello?,10,Big Bang Theory,7,1
49413,Howard,4, Call you back.,10,Big Bang Theory,15,3
49415,Sheldon,4," No, Dr. Feynman. If I solve it for you, you'll never learn.",10,Big Bang Theory,60,12
49417,Penny,4," Wow, where did you learn these moves?",10,Big Bang Theory,38,7
49418,Leonard,4," The world may have forgotten about Dance Dance Revolution, but not this smooth criminal.",10,Big Bang Theory,89,14
49420,Howard,4," Okay, you're positive you want to know?",10,Big Bang Theory,40,7
49422,Howard,4, Okay. Here we go. It's ringing.,10,Big Bang Theory,32,6
49423,Raj,4, Hello?,10,Big Bang Theory,7,1
49425,Howard,4, Wrong number.,10,Big Bang Theory,14,2
49427,Penny,4, I told you not to do the worm.,10,Big Bang Theory,31,8
49428,Leonard,4, You were right. ,10,Big Bang Theory,17,3
49430,Raj,4, Hello.,10,Big Bang Theory,7,1
49433,Amy,4," Oh, oh, oh.",10,Big Bang Theory,12,3
49434,Sheldon,4, What are you doing down there?,10,Big Bang Theory,31,6
49435,Amy,4, Hang on.,10,Big Bang Theory,9,2
49436,Sheldon,4, Who are you calling? Aaargh!,10,Big Bang Theory,29,5
49438,Amy,4, I'm so sore. I don't think I slept two minutes last night.,10,Big Bang Theory,59,12
49439,Penny,4," Yeah, get it, girl.",10,Big Bang Theory,20,4
49440,Amy,4, It's not what you think.,10,Big Bang Theory,25,5
49441,Leonard,4, I feel like I pulled something. Why didn't you tell me to stop?,10,Big Bang Theory,64,13
49442,Penny,4, Even more not what you think.,10,Big Bang Theory,30,6
49443,Amy,4, I don't know if I can make it through five weeks living with him.,10,Big Bang Theory,66,14
49444,Leonard,4," If you ever need a break, the owner of the train store will let you leave him there while you get a coffee.",10,Big Bang Theory,108,23
49445,Penny,4, Yeah.,10,Big Bang Theory,6,1
49446,Sheldon,4," Good morning. See? I didn't knock, but it's fine. I didn't knock, but it's fine. I didn't knock, but it's fine. So, how is everyone?",10,Big Bang Theory,133,25
49447,Amy,4, Miserable and exhausted.,10,Big Bang Theory,25,3
49448,Sheldon,4, Really? I slept great.,10,Big Bang Theory,23,4
49449,Amy,4," Well, I didn't, and it's your fault.",10,Big Bang Theory,37,7
49450,Sheldon,4, How? You had the whole floor to yourself.,10,Big Bang Theory,42,8
49451,Amy,4," Sheldon, maybe living together is a bad idea.",10,Big Bang Theory,46,8
49452,Sheldon,4," Well, but what kind of scientists would we be, drawing a conclusion after only 12 hours of data?",10,Big Bang Theory,97,18
49453,Amy,4, The kind who almost put a pillow over your face last night.,10,Big Bang Theory,60,12
49454,Sheldon,4," Wow. I anticipated we'd have problems, but I never thought your scientific rigour would be one of them.",10,Big Bang Theory,104,18
49455,Amy,4," I'm sorry, are you questioning my integrity as a scientist?",10,Big Bang Theory,60,10
49456,Sheldon,4, If the lab room disposable shoe cover fits.,10,Big Bang Theory,44,8
49457,Penny,4, Was that a science diss?,10,Big Bang Theory,25,5
49458,Leonard,4, Yeah.,10,Big Bang Theory,6,1
49459,Penny,4, Was it a good one?,10,Big Bang Theory,19,5
49460,Leonard,4, Eh.,10,Big Bang Theory,4,1
