607,SpongeBob,8," Fine.  Put me in the brig, I don't mind!",1,SpongeBob SquarePants,41,9

681,SpongeBob,8, There's no time for that! Just push harder. ,1,SpongeBob SquarePants,45,8
682,Sandy,8," SpongeBob, what are y'all doing? I can't turn my back on you for two seconds without you causing a whole mess of trouble. Why look at ya, bagging up all your friends and neighbors just like they were a fresh crop of hickory smoked sausages. You darned turned my little science experiment into a disaster.

3513,Squidward,33," Well, then, the last one you owe me because you got me back into this mess!",2,SpongeBob SquarePants,76,16
3514,Patrick,33," Wait! I think it belongs to me!  Because I didn't really get a real wish, so why should you get a wish...",2,SpongeBob SquarePants,106,22
3515,SpongeBob,33," Well, that's not right because... ",2,SpongeBob SquarePants,35,5
3517,Squidward,33," Now, think, SpongeBob! We're about to get eaten. What can you wish for to make it so we don't get eaten?",2,SpongeBob SquarePants,105,21

3623,SpongeBob,34, Really?! Then I would like to go back to the Krusty Krab.,2,SpongeBob SquarePants,58,12
3624,Plankton,34, Let's not get carried away. Now what can I do to make you more comfortable here at the Chum Bucket?,2,SpongeBob SquarePants,100,20
3625,SpongeBob,34," Well, I usually cook on a grill.",2,SpongeBob SquarePants,33,7

3628,Plankton,34," Say no more, I'll take care of everything.  How about here?",2,SpongeBob SquarePants,60,11
3629,SpongeBob,34, A little more to the left.,2,SpongeBob SquarePants,27,6

3686,Patrick,35," Hey, hands off, PeepingBob! This here is my secret box! Besides, if I showed you what was inside, it wouldn't be a secret anymore. Duh!  Oh, SpongeBob… if only you could see what's inside my secret box, it would change your life! ",2,SpongeBob SquarePants,233,42
3687,SpongeBob,35," It's okay, Patrick, I know all about secrets. ",2,SpongeBob SquarePants,47,8
3688,Patrick,35, You do? ,2,SpongeBob SquarePants,9,2
3689,SpongeBob,35, I've got a gazillion secrets! ,2,SpongeBob SquarePants,31,5
3690,Patrick,35, Like what? ,2,SpongeBob SquarePants,12,2
3691,SpongeBob,35," Well, it's not a secret that the best thing about a secret is secretly telling someone your secret, thereby secretly adding another secret to their secret collection of secrets. Secretly.  ",2,SpongeBob SquarePants,191,31
3692,SpongeBob,35, You wanna hear one of my secrets? ,2,SpongeBob SquarePants,35,7
3693,Patrick,35, Do I? ,2,SpongeBob SquarePants,7,2
3694,SpongeBob,35, Uhh... Let's see...  Did you know that you're my best friend? ,2,SpongeBob SquarePants,63,11
3695,Patrick,35," No... way. Oh, let's hear another one! ",2,SpongeBob SquarePants,40,7
3696,SpongeBob,35, Okay. Uhh... Secretly... I'm a little bit naive. ,2,SpongeBob SquarePants,50,8
3697,Patrick,35," WOW! I'll never look at you the same way again, SpongeBob. Gosh.  Tell me some more secrets! ",2,SpongeBob SquarePants,94,17
3698,SpongeBob,35," Okay. I love my job at the Krusty Krab, I sleep with my shoes on, I like jelly on both sides of my toast, I've got an overdue library book, I think Jelly-Fishing and Bubble-Blowing are the…  ...overbite. I've never been late for work, I've said the word ""fancy"" in conversation, I like to dance to loading zone announcements, I still don't have my driver's license. I'm a little bit on the short side. And I'm wearing three pairs of underwear right now. ",2,SpongeBob SquarePants,457,83
3699,Patrick,35, Gasp. I never would have guessed. ,2,SpongeBob SquarePants,35,6
3700,SpongeBob,35, Now will you show me what's inside your secret box? ,2,SpongeBob SquarePants,53,10
3701,Patrick,35," No, SpongeBob! It's for me to know and for you to never find out. You may be an open book SpongeBob, but I'm a bit more complicated than that. The inner machinations of my mind are an enigma.  ",2,SpongeBob SquarePants,195,39
3702,SpongeBob,35," Oh, yeah?! Well, I got plenty a secrets stuff, too! Uhh…  I've got my secret socks on.  And my secret Gary's bowl!  My secret TV!  And my secret TV channel.  What do you think of that, Patrick? Patrick? ",2,SpongeBob SquarePants,206,38
3703,Patrick,35,"  Maybe if you saw what was inside, you'd know why it has to be secret.  Inside this very box is the most secret-y secret of all of secret-dom and I am it's sole witness! It's a heavy burden, SpongeBob, but nobody must know the secret of the box.  Nobody! Not even… Squidward's house.  It's a full-time job. I'm constantly on the alert. You never know when someone's gonna…  SpongeBob! What do you think you're doing?! That's my secret box! Now, hand it over! ",2,SpongeBob SquarePants,465,83
3704,SpongeBob,35," But, Patrick, I must know the secret! ",2,SpongeBob SquarePants,39,7
3705,Patrick,35," For the last time, SpongeBob, no! ",2,SpongeBob SquarePants,35,6
3706,SpongeBob,35," Come on, Patrick, just a peek? ",2,SpongeBob SquarePants,32,6
3707,Patrick,35," Never!  So, it's come to this. And to think that we joined the Best Friends Forever Club!  Listen up, SpongeBob SecretStealerPants!  If you ever come close to my secret box again, we won't be friends anymore! ",2,SpongeBob SquarePants,210,36
3708,SpongeBob,35," But... we're supposed to be...  friends forever.  I feel so filthy!  I have soiled our friendship garden! I just couldn't help myself!  I know it's your secret! I promise to respect that! Oh, please forgive me, Patrick! Please! ",2,SpongeBob SquarePants,229,38
3709,Patrick,35," Well... I guess it's not all your fault. After all, this is a pretty great secret. I mean, how could you resist the greatest secret ever?  The most amazing...  mysterious... powerful secret in all Bikini Bottom. ",2,SpongeBob SquarePants,213,36
3710,SpongeBob,35," So, what do you say, buddy? Friends? ",2,SpongeBob SquarePants,38,7
3711,Patrick,35, Friends. ,2,SpongeBob SquarePants,10,1
3712,SpongeBob,35," What could be in that box that Patrick doesn't want me to see? Maybe it's the world's only albino jellyfish!  Or maybe Patrick's a master jewel thief and it's full of diamonds.  Or maybe Patrick's a deranged maniac who keeps his victim's severed heads in a box.  Or even worse! Maybe it's an embarrassing snapshot of me from the Christmas party!  I've gotta find out what's in that secret box! I'm not gonna rest until I do!  That's it! How do you look in a secret box?  Secretly, of course! I'll just take the box while Patrick's sleeping, look in that box, and before Patrick even has time to notice, I'll slide it back.  Patrick won't know when I'll have my own little secret. Good idea, eh, Gary? ",2,SpongeBob SquarePants,702,128
3714,SpongeBob,35," Oh, what do you know, you're a snail!  ",2,SpongeBob SquarePants,41,9

That bloated starfish is gonna run right through me!  I'll just fix that right now.  Wait, that makes my north wall a weak spot! Here we go! Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  Oh, oh, oh! But if they attack from the rear, I'm a goner!  There... Ha-ha!  But what about the possibility of an aerial attack!  I guess that ought to do it!  Fort Squidward is now all but impenetrable!

5144,Mr. Krabs,47," The only thing you better lay is some patties on the grill, Fry Boy.",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,69,14
5145,SpongeBob,47," Nah, I can't take that gig, Krabber. That phase in my career is over. I'm an entertainer now.",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,94,18
5146,Mr. Krabs,47, What in blazes are you talking about?,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,38,7
5147,SpongeBob,47," Come on, Krabs. Let's think outside the box for a second. Commercials are old-hat. The people want music. If I could change fate I would, Krabsy. And I'm an entertainer deep down. A people's person. We're on the same page here, aren't we?",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,239,43
5148,Mr. Krabs,47," Boy, those Krabby fumes must've gotten to your head. Borrow Squidward's gas mask and get right back to work.",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,109,19

5155,SpongeBob,47," Pipe down, Squidward. This crowd looks angry. They're not going to wait any longer. I think I better give them what they need, and fast.",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,137,25
5156,Squidward,47," I think so, too, or Krabs will fire both of us.  On second thought, keep 'em waiting.",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,86,17

5174,SpongeBob,47," Well, the most I can juggle is three, but the show must go on. Whoa! ",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,70,15
5176,SpongeBob,47, No!  My career is over. All those years clawing my way up. All the people I've stepped on. Wasted. ,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,100,19
5179,SpongeBob,47," They seem to like it when I put this patty on the grill. I may be able to save this act, yet. Roll with it, SpongeBob. Roll with it. There's more where that came from, folks. ",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,176,36
5181,SpongeBob,47, You like that?,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,15,3

5200,Sandy,48, SpongeBob's actin' jumpier than a rattlesnake in a pickle barrel. Wait... what?,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,80,12
5201,SpongeBob,48,"  Oh, I'll be changing alright, but not into a bathing suit. Wait until Sandy sees that I brought my karate gear! Hi-yah!  Hi-yah!  Sandy won't beat me this time, because I've got the elements on my side. The elements of surprise. Hi-yah! ",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,239,42

5291,SpongeBob,48," Well, then, I guess it's time to take it up a notch. ",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,54,12
5293,SpongeBob,48, I am not a weenie!,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,19,5

5335,Sandy,48, You ran inside and slipped on an ice cube. ,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,44,9
5337,SpongeBob,48, I slipped on an ice cube and got covered in boo-boos.,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,54,11

5348,SpongeBob,49," Hurry, Gary, the scary robot movie's on.",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,41,7
5350,SpongeBob,49," What do you mean I shouldn't watch this? Scary movies don't always freak me out.  What if Mom is a robot? What if Uncle Sherm is a robot? What if Gary is a robot? Gary?  Psst, Gary? Gere-Bear? ",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,194,38
5352,SpongeBob,49," Gary, if you were a robot, you'd tell me, right?",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,49,10

5361,SpongeBob,49," #17 --  Krabby Patty and a medium beverage. Course. Sorry Squidward, I'm not really feeling myself today. I guess I'm a little bit jumpy. I keep thinking robots are taking over the world, probably on account of this movie I watched last night where robots take over the world. I even asked Gary if he was a robot! Pretty funny, huh?",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,333,61
5362,Squidward,49,  Hilarious. Just deliver the food.,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,35,5

5368,Mr. Krabs,49," Come on, little buddy, play it again.  Please? One more time, for me.",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,70,13
5369,SpongeBob,49," That was strange. Mr. Krabs was talking to his radio, and he said he feels ""recharged.""  If I didn't know better, I'd say he was...  ...a robot. Nah.",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,150,28
5370,Mr. Krabs,49,"  Yes, hello. I was wondering if you could play that song again.",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,64,12
5372,Mr. Krabs,49," The one that goes ""bee-boo-boo-bop, boo-boo-beep.""",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,51,6
5374,Mr. Krabs,49," Bee-boo-boo-boo-boo-bop,  bee-boo-boo-bop,  boo-boo-bee-bop?  Not bee-boo-boo-beep?  Bop?  Beep?  Boo-boo-bop? ",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,112,8
5375,SpongeBob,49," Oh my gosh. Why was Mr. Krabs making all those beeping sounds? Could it be that he's...  ...a robot? Nah.  Oh, Squidward, it's terrible! Mr. Krabs... talking to radio... beeping sounds... strange dancing... robot!",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,214,34
5376,Squidward,49,"  That's great, SpongeBob. Why don't you work on this problem back in the kitchen? ",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,83,14
5377,SpongeBob,49," I'm serious, Squidward! Mr. Krabs is a robot. And I can prove it, too.",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,71,14
5378,Squidward,49,  How did you...?,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,17,3
5379,SpongeBob,49," Let's see, in the movie the robots didn't have a sense of humor! They couldn't laugh. Hey, Mr. Krabs!",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,102,19
5380,Mr. Krabs,49,"  What is it, boy?",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,18,4
5381,SpongeBob,49, Squidward just told me a hilarious joke and I thought you might like to hear it.,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,81,16
5382,Mr. Krabs,49," Is it true, Squidward? Is it hilarious?",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,40,7
5383,Squidward,49," Umm... yeah, sure.",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,19,3
5384,Mr. Krabs,49," Well, let's hear it, lad.",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,26,5
5385,SpongeBob,49," Okay, here it goes! Uhh, how'd it go Squidward?",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,48,9
5386,Squidward,49,"  Uhh, it went, umm, uhh, let's see, uhh... why couldn't the 11-year-old get into the pirate movie?",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,99,17
5387,Mr. Krabs,49, Why?,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,5,1
5388,Squidward,49," It was rated ""R.""  Arr! Because it's... about... pirates.",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,58,9
5389,Mr. Krabs,49," I'm not paying you to do stand up, Mr. Squidward! Now get back to work!",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,72,15
5390,SpongeBob,49,"  Not even a chuckle. See, Squidward? He didn't laugh because he couldn't laugh because he's...  ...a robot.",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,108,17
5391,Squidward,49," There's a logical explanation why he didn't laugh, SpongeBob. He's obviously heard it before. The only reason you think Krabs is a robot is because you watched that stupid movie. Now why don't you...",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,200,34
5392,SpongeBob,49," Hey, Mr. Krabs!",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,16,3
5393,Mr. Krabs,49,"  What? What is it, boy?",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,24,5
5394,SpongeBob,49, Squidward's father never hugged him. Isn't that sad? ,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,54,8
5395,Mr. Krabs,49," Yes, I suppose that is rather sad, but Squidward can hug himself during his break! Now get back to work!",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,105,20
5396,SpongeBob,49, Just like the robot in the movie. He couldn't cry either.,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,58,11
5397,Squidward,49," SpongeBob, this is getting ridiculous. I'll have you know my father loved me very much!",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,88,15
5398,SpongeBob,49," That's the final test, Squidward. The love test. Robots can't love.",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,68,11
5399,Squidward,49," No, wait, SpongeBob!",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,21,3
5400,SpongeBob,49," Hey, Mr. Krabs!",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,16,3
5401,Mr. Krabs,49,"  What is it, SpongeBob?!",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,25,4

5411,Squidward,49," Okay, so tell me, does Mr. Krabs look anything like that?",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,58,11

5427,SpongeBob,49," Yeah, you know, they get the straight poop, ask questions, get information.",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,76,12
5428,Squidward,49," I never thought I'd say this, but, SpongeBob, let's get that poop! ",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,68,12
5429,Mr. Krabs,49," Oh, hello, boys.  What can I do for you?  Heh-heh, why did you lock the door?  Why do you have that rope? Who's watching the cash register?!  SpongeBob! Squidward! What's the meaning of this?! Untie me this instant!",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,216,38
5430,Squidward,49, Shut up! ,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,10,2

5438,Squidward,49, And the only way to deal with these robot types is to find out what they know.,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,79,17
5439,SpongeBob,49, Right. ,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,8,1
5440,Squidward,49," SpongeBob, you got to ask him a question first.",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,48,9
5441,SpongeBob,49," Oh, yeah. What color is my underwear? ",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,39,7
5442,Squidward,49," SpongeBob, let me handle this.  Where's Mr. Krabs?",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,51,8
5443,Mr. Krabs,49,  What are you talking about? I'm Mr. Krabs. ,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,45,8
5444,Squidward,49, We can do this all night if you want. Where's Mr. Krabs?,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,57,12
5445,Mr. Krabs,49, I'm Mr. Krabs.,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,15,3
5446,SpongeBob,49, Where's Mr. Krabs?,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,19,3
5447,Mr. Krabs,49, I'm Mr. Krabs.,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,15,3
5448,Squidward,49, Where's Mr. Krabs?,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,19,3
5449,Mr. Krabs,49, I am Mr. Krabs! I am! I am! I am! I am! I am! I am! I am!,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,58,18
5450,SpongeBob,49, This is one stubborn robot.,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,28,5
5451,Mr. Krabs,49,  What?!  You think I'm a robot?!,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,33,6
5452,Squidward,49, We don't think; we know.,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,25,5
5453,Mr. Krabs,49, That's the silliest thing I ever heard! I am Mr. Krabs!,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,56,11
5454,Squidward,49,  He's not cracking. We'll never get it out of him this way.,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,60,12
5455,SpongeBob,49," I got an idea.  Keep an eye on him, Squidward. Don't fall for any of his robot tricks.  If Robot Krabs won't tell us where Mr. Krabs is, maybe one of his little robot friends will. ",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,182,36
5456,Squidward,49," SpongeBob, uhh, that's a blender.",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,34,5
5457,SpongeBob,49," Yeah, but I saw Mr. Krabs talking with his radio before. He called it his ""little buddy.""",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,90,17
5458,Squidward,49," Oh, really? Put it on the table, SpongeBob.",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,44,8
5459,Mr. Krabs,49, You're gonna interrogate my blender? You're crazy.,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,51,7
5460,Squidward,49," We're just gonna see what your ""little buddy"" knows. ",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,54,9
5461,Mr. Krabs,49,"  No, wait! What are you going to do with me blender?! That cost me money!",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,74,15
5462,Squidward,49," Where's Mr. Krabs?  Not talking, eh? ",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,38,6
5463,Mr. Krabs,49, No! That cost me $24.95!,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,25,5
5464,SpongeBob,49, I guess it didn't know anything.,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,33,6
5465,Squidward,49, Go get the toaster. ,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,21,4
5466,Mr. Krabs,49," No, not me toaster. That cost me $32.50!  $62.67!  Four... well, actually, that one was a gift.  Nooo!",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,103,18
5467,SpongeBob,49,"  This is the last robot, Squidward.",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,36,6
5468,Mr. Krabs,49," No, not my cash register! I raised it myself. I got it when it was just a little calculator.  No! ",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,99,20
5469,Squidward,49, I thought you said robots can't cry.,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,37,7
5470,SpongeBob,49, I also said they couldn't love.,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,32,6
5471,Mr. Krabs,49,  I loved it like it was me own.,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,32,8
5472,SpongeBob,49," Uh, at least he's not laughing.",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,32,6
5473,Mr. Krabs,49," Oh, I remember the laughs we used to share! ",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,45,9
5474,Squidward,49," SpongeBob uhh, how did that movie of yours end?",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,48,9
5475,SpongeBob,49," The movie? Oh, yeah! The ending was great! Turns out there weren't any robots after all. It was just their... imagination.  Hey, it's time to feed Gary. ",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,154,27
5476,Mr. Krabs,49,  Squidward!,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,12,1
5484,SpongeBob,50," Hey, Squidward, check this out.  Two ordinary Krabby Patties, but when expertly tossed with the skill of a champ, they become... ",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,130,21
5485,Patrick,50, A one-way ticket to pain!! ,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,28,5
5486,Mr. Krabs,50, Huh? ,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,6,1
5487,SpongeBob,50, Heave-ho! ,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,11,1
5489,SpongeBob,50, But we were performing a ritual to attract customers. And the only way the ritual can work is for us to get hurt. Real bad.,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,124,25
5490,Mr. Krabs,50, What stupid barnacle told you that?,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,36,6
5491,Squidward,50, Uhh… ,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,8,1
5492,Mr. Krabs,50," Listen, instead of killing yourselves, I've got something real important for you to do for me.  Now, are you men ready for your Super...?",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,138,24
5494,Mr. Krabs,50, Special...?,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,12,1
5496,Mr. Krabs,50,  Secret...?,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,12,1
5498,Mr. Krabs,50, Assignment?,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,12,1
5500,Mr. Krabs,50, The two of you are to paint the inside of me house! ,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,53,12
5502,Mr. Krabs,50," But, let me give you two a warning. This here paint is absolutely permanent.  It will never come off. So if I see even one drop on anything but wall, I'll have your rear ends cut off...  …AND MOUNTED OVER ME FIREPLACE!!!! So, have fun with the job. ",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,252,48
5503,SpongeBob,50, Patrick?,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,9,1
5504,Patrick,50," Yeah, SpongeBob? ",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,18,2
5505,SpongeBob,50, Mr. Krabs sure has a lot of expensive treasures to drip paint on. Do you think we should take this stuff off the walls?,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,120,24
5506,Patrick,50," No way, SpongeBob, we're not getting paid to move stuff.",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,57,10
5507,SpongeBob,50," Patrick, we're not getting paid at all.",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,40,7
5508,Patrick,50, Well that's what I said! We're not getting paid and that's final!,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,66,12
5509,SpongeBob,50," Ok, we'll just paint around all this stuff.",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,44,8
5510,Patrick,50," Good, just don't pay me.",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,25,5
5511,SpongeBob,50, First we need to set up the tarp.,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,34,8
5512,Patrick,50, Tarp ahoy! ,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,12,2
5513,SpongeBob,50," We're gonna need more coverage, Patrick.  Now that's what I'm talking about. Well, I guess we should open these cans of permanent paint now.",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,141,24
5514,Patrick,50, That will never ever come off.,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,31,6
5515,SpongeBob,50," And if we get it on anything, Mr. Krabs will cut our butts off.",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,64,14
5516,Patrick,50," And mount them on the wall.  Careful, SpongeBob. Careful, SpongeBob. SpongeBob, careful. Careful, SpongeBob. Careful, SpongeBob! Careful, SpongeBob!  CAREFUL, SPONGEBOB!!",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,171,20
5517,SpongeBob,50," Patrick, the lid's already off.",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,32,5
5518,Patrick,50, Oh. Now it's my turn! ,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,23,5
5519,SpongeBob,50," I'm thinking I should do this one too, Patrick. ",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,49,9
5521,Patrick,50, Well that was a rip-off. ,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,26,5
5522,SpongeBob,50," Ok, Patrick, let's get our brushes ready.  Uhh, maybe we should start with a smaller brush.  All right, Patrick, gotta get started painting this wall. With the permanent paint that we're not allowed to get on anything but the wall. Well, here we go.",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,250,44
5524,SpongeBob,50,  Just a few more seconds of mental preparation and I'll be painting this wall.,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,79,14
5526,SpongeBob,50,  I'm getting to the painting.,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,30,5
5528,Patrick,50,"  Can you move it along, I'm all out of time cards.",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,51,11
5529,SpongeBob,50, No problem. Here I go.  Yeah! Huh?  Barnacles! What could be worse than a giant paint bubble!?,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,95,17
5530,Patrick,50," Oh, I know!  Two giant paint bubbles!",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,38,7
5531,SpongeBob,50, Noooooo!  Patrick?,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,19,2

5533,SpongeBob,50, I don't think this bubble can get much bigger!,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,47,9
5534,Patrick,50,  Nonsense!,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,11,1
5535,SpongeBob,50,"  Pat, no!  We did it! We painted the whole house and without getting a drop of paint on anything but the--   Flappin' Flotsam! What's that?!  We're dead, Patrick! Do you know what that is?",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,189,34
5536,Patrick,50, Hmm... it's a dollar. I win!,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,29,6
5537,SpongeBob,50, That's not just a dollar. It's Mr. Krabs' first dollar! His most prized possession! And we got paint on it!,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,108,20
5538,Patrick,50," I think you are over-reacting SpongeBob, I don't see any paint.",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,64,11
5539,SpongeBob,50," Ok, this isn't a problem. Maybe I can just wipe it off.  There! I think I got it. ",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,83,18
5540,Patrick,50," Oh, now I see it!",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,18,5
5541,SpongeBob,50," This is not good, Patrick! This is not good! Mr. Krabs is gonna be home soon, and when he sees what we did to his first dollar… ",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,131,27
5543,Patrick,50," Wait, SpongeBob, all we got to do is wash the paint off and Krabs will never know!",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,83,17
5544,SpongeBob,50, But Mr. Krabs said…,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,22,4
5545,Patrick,50, Forget what Mr. Krabs said! Every paint comes off with something! ,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,67,11
5546,SpongeBob,50, Did it work? ,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,14,3

5556,SpongeBob,50, It didn't work.,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,16,3
5557,Patrick,50,"  This is all Mr. Krabs' fault! If he hadn't hung that stupid dollar in the first place!...I mean, it's not like it looks any different than a regular dollar. Why hang it? You could just stick any old dollar bill on the wall, no one would even know the difference! You might as well reach in my wallet, pull out a dollar, and put it on the wall! And it would...",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,361,71
5558,SpongeBob,50," Hurry, Patrick, take out your wallet.",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,38,6

5574,SpongeBob,50,"  It's not our fault, Mr Krabs!",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,31,6
5575,Patrick,50,  We didn't do it on purpose!,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,29,6
5577,Patrick,50,  I don't want to be butt-less!,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,31,6
5578,Mr. Krabs,50," Oh, and I suppose the floor molding just painted itself on its own.  That's what I call craftsmanship. Criminy jim-jam! you messed up my dollar...  ...rama!  All the dolls in this dollarama were perfectly aligned! ",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,215,35
5580,Mr. Krabs,50," And you boys thought I wouldn't notice. Oh well, I guess no harm done. All right boys, you're free to go.  Ow!!!!! That's funny, I don't remember a stack of painting jutting from the wall where me first dollar used to be. In fact, I don't remember this painting at all.  Or this one.  Or this one.  Or this one.

6314,Squidward,56," Whatever.  Here you are, sir. One Krabby Patty. ",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,49,8
6315,Mr. Krabs,56, I don't understand. We haven't had a customer in weeks. I wonder if it's the new placemats.,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,92,17
6316,Squidward,56, What?  Placemats? Have you lost your mind? It's that old Patty you keep trying to sell to everybody! It's gone bad.,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,116,21
6317,Mr. Krabs,56," Gone bad? That's nonsense. Bring it here, SpongeBob.  Uh, why is it in a cage?",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,79,15
6318,SpongeBob,56, Because it growled at me. ,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,27,5

6354,Squidward,56," Well, it was.",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,14,3
6355,Mr. Krabs,56," You know, boys, being sick made me do a lot of thinking. My whole life has been about money. Saving money, collecting money,  touching money...  Well, you get the picture. But no more. You're looking at the new, improved, non-cheap Mr. Krabs.  Welcome all, welcome!  Hello, little one. What you got there?",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,306,52

6412,Mr. Krabs,56, You heard what I said about the money?,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,39,8
6414,SpongeBob,56,"  Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy merchandise were the closest thing to everything. I love jellyfishing, you should love jellyfishing. You should come some time and bring your own net!",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,181,29

6434,SpongeBob,57,"  Gee Mr. K., you sure have a scorching case of summer fever!  What is it about summertime that makes us so happy? The firefly-lit nights, the intoxicating aroma of a charcoal briquette, the hypnotic sound of a lawnmower running over a flip-flop?",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,246,42
6435,Mr. Krabs,57, The money!,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,11,2
6436,SpongeBob,57, The money?,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,11,2

6445,SpongeBob,57," Hey, maybe they're all at that new playground over there. ",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,59,10

6447,SpongeBob,57," See anything, Mr. Krabs?",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,25,4
6448,Mr. Krabs,57," Oh, they're here, all right. Just look at them, SpongeBob.  So weak and malnourished.  With nobody trying to sell 'em nothing.  Breaks me heart.  No! I've got nothing to live for, SpongeBob!",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,191,32
6449,SpongeBob,57, The way you drove the boat while lying on the ground was kind of cool.,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,71,15
6450,Mr. Krabs,57," True. But that's not gonna get these munchkins away from this playground. Unless... hmmm... see you tomorrow, boy. Got a lot of work to do. ",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,141,25
6451,SpongeBob,57," You got it, Mr. Krabs... hey!  Another day, another dollar. Gee, I wonder what Mr. Krabs has been up to since I saw him last and then went home to do nothing of particular interest 'til this very moment.  Huh? ",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,211,40

6471,SpongeBob,57,"  Hey, kids!",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,12,2

6475,SpongeBob,57," Krabby will be here soon. He, uh, had to take the bus. But in the meantime, let's have some fun! You kids like bubbles? ",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,121,24
6477,SpongeBob,57," Well, you've never seen my bubbles.  Voila! A bubble shaped like a jellyfish. How 'bout that?",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,94,16
6479,SpongeBob,57,"  Okay, prepare to be blown back on your tailfins.  Ta-da!  Uh... huh.",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,70,12
6481,SpongeBob,57," Okay, uh... and now for a finale!  Oops.",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,41,8
6483,SpongeBob,57,"  My eyes!  Whoa!   They seem to respond to me being in pain. They enjoy other people's misery.  Hey kids, check this out. ",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,123,22

6493,SpongeBob,57, Ugh. Mr. Krabs? I can't take any more of this stalling stuff.,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,62,12
6494,Mr. Krabs,57," Always thinking about yourself. Get out there and stall! What happened to your arms and legs, boy?",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,99,17
6495,SpongeBob,57, The kids are using them as... boomerangs. ,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,43,7
6496,Mr. Krabs,57, Boomerangs? Oh no! They might break my windows!,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,48,8
6497,SpongeBob,57, What are we gonna do?,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,22,5
6498,Mr. Krabs,57," Well, now that all their money's counted, tell them Krabby has just arrived!",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,77,13

6512,Mr. Krabs,57," Hey, I ain't cheap!  Now take this tomato back to the kitchen before it spoils.",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,80,15
6513,SpongeBob,57, But what about the true meaning of summer? What about the children?,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,68,12
6514,Mr. Krabs,57,"  The children? I don't care about the children.  I just care about their parents' money. Ah, the fact that their feeble minds are easily manipulated by cheap playgrounds and talentless clowns is no skin off my nose.  Survival of the fittest, SpongeBob! Survival of the fittest. ",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,279,46
6516,Mr. Krabs,57," Huh?  Oh, hey kids.  Uh... Uncle Krabs has to go to the bank now. Heh.",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,71,15

6525,SpongeBob,57, Where's Mr. Krabs? He's missing out on all the summer fun.,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,59,11
6526,Mr. Krabs,57,  Let me go! I gotta get some of that green stuff!  No! Not that green stuff!  Noooooooooo!,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,91,17
6536,SpongeBob,58, I lost something once. I lost something I couldn't live without-- my identity.,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,79,13
6539,SpongeBob,58,  It all started last week-- Monday morning to be exact-- the day I lost my identity.,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,85,16
6541,SpongeBob,58,"  Good morning, world, and all who inhabit it.  Awk! Gary, help! I can't see. Gary!  Gary, are you there?  Ow!  Gary? Gary, buddy? I need you to be my eyes, okay? Am I near the bathroom?  Gary? Gary?  Gar? ",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,206,39

6546,SpongeBob,58," That was the worst thing I've ever tasted. Oh well, at least I'll never have to do it again.  Barnacles! All these shenanigans made me late for work.  Uh oh.  All right! ",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,171,32
6547,Patrick,58," Hi, SpongeBob!",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,15,2

6552,SpongeBob,58," Ah, ah, ah, patience, good people. A great story can't be rushed. However, I will skip ahead to the Krusty Krab.  Order up!  One Krabby Patty grilled with the fiery warmth of my beating heart. Enjoy.",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,200,36
6554,SpongeBob,58, Is there a problem?,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,20,4
6556,SpongeBob,58,"  While it is against my philosophy to disagree with the customer, I must point out that I am in fact wearing a name tag, right here.  Huh? ",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,140,27
6557,Squidward,58," Uh, SpongeBob?",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,15,2
6558,SpongeBob,58," Oh, Squidward, it's terrible! It's the most terrible thing that's ever happened to me. I lost my name tag. Pourquoi!",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,117,20

6562,SpongeBob,58," I'm innocent, I tell ya!  Squidward, what happened?",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,52,8

6564,SpongeBob,58, Huh? ,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,6,1
6565,Squidward,58," SpongeBob, will you get a hold of yourself? Since when is losing your name tag the end of the world? ",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,102,20
6566,Mr. Krabs,58," Attention, all employees! Just a quick heads-up, boys. There's going to be a surprise uniform inspection in one hour. Anyone who doesn't pass gets the boot!  This boot, to be exact. It's very stinky, and you'll have to wear it all day. See you in an hour. ",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,257,47
6567,Squidward,58," SpongeBob, if you really want to find your name tag, just retrace your steps.",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,78,14
6568,SpongeBob,58," Retrace my steps? Squidward, you're a genius.",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,46,7

6578,SpongeBob,58," Patrick, what are you talking about?",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,37,6
6579,Patrick,58, My hellos aren't just some tape recording that you can rewind and play over and over. They're special!,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,103,18

6582,SpongeBob,58," Okay, Patrick, you know the plan, right?",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,41,7

6584,SpongeBob,58," Perfect. Hmm, I guess I should start with when I woke up.  I sure hope this works.  Good morning, world, and all who inhabit it!  So far, so good.  I don't see my name tag up here.  Now that my horrific moment of terror is over, how about some breakfast?  The most important meal of the day, serving it up Gary's way.  Bleah! Okay, next I just have to walk outside and say hi to Patrick.  Patrick!",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,398,77
6585,Patrick,58, What?,3,SpongeBob SquarePants,6,1

6597,Patrick,58," Well, what did you do after I said hi to you this morning?",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,59,13
6598,SpongeBob,58," Hmm, let's see.  I skipped merrily to the Krusty Krab, said hello to Old Man Jenkins, placed an apple on Mr. Krabs' desk... and that's about it. Oh, and these two guys threw me in the dumpster.  Good one, guys! ",3,SpongeBob SquarePants,212,40

7661,Patrick,66, Try telling that to Squidly. ,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,30,5

7689,Plankton,67, Why did I ever buy that computer wife? I need a real woman--not a girl in a cold-hearted shell.  Such beauty. She's an angel; and no wires. I've never felt like this before. I don't even know her name and yet she's stolen my heart.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,232,45

7695,Plankton,67, And now to woo that beloved creature. ,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,39,7
7697,Plankton,67," Hmmm, I guess she's not a poetry fan.  You"" on the ground, but while destroying some of the town when doing this. Mama Krabs reads it and screams a few times. The Trouble Song] Poetry, love notes--nothing's working. Perhaps something personal. ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,245,41
7699,Plankton,67," Oh, yeah...I am smooth.  Just dial the number and ask her to dinner. C'mon, you can do this. ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,94,18
7701,Plankton,67, Wait! This is your secret admirer.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,35,6
7703,Plankton,67,  No. I program the robot. Did you enjoy the gift I sent you?,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,61,13
7705,Plankton,67," It was...just a lucky guess. I've admired you from afar for far too long, my angel. We must meet face-to-face.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,111,20
7706,Plankton,67," Sounds wonderful. I'll be the tall fellow wearing a red carnation. Until tonight, my dear. ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,92,15
7707,Mr. Krabs,67," Ah! Quick, SpongeBob, swallow me wallet!",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,41,6
7708,SpongeBob,67, OK. ,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,5,1

7718,Mr. Krabs,67, Boyfriend? Someone to spend money...I mean time with you? That's wonderful! Who is he? What's his name?,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,104,17

7723,Plankton,67,"  Excuse me, I can't reach my silverware!",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,41,7
7724,SpongeBob,67," Terribly sorry, sir.  Will there be anything else?",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,51,8
7725,Plankton,67, Is my tie on straight?,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,23,5

7744,SpongeBob,67, And this devilishly handsome sponge is your waiter.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,52,8
7745,Mr. Krabs,67," SpongeBob! I don't know what sort of skullduggory you're up to, Plankton, and I'm not waiting to find out. ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,108,19

7755,Plankton,67," I'm serious, Eugene. I've changed my ways. And all it took was the love of a beautiful woman.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,94,18
7756,Mr. Krabs,67," All you love is thieving and conniving. Now, stop trying to get the formula out of me mother.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,94,18

7766,Mr. Krabs,67,"  Uh, yeah...funny thing about that.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,36,5
7768,Mr. Krabs,67," Yes, mommy. ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,13,2
7769,Plankton,67, Somebody call heaven because I think an angel's gone missing.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,62,10
7771,Plankton,67," Oh, Mrs. Krabs.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,16,3
7772,Mr. Krabs,67," Oh, brother.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,13,2
7773,Plankton,67," Attention, attention everyone. I'd like to make an announcement. Mrs. Krabs, in full view of this restaurant, I ask you for your hand in holy matrimony.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,153,26
7775,Plankton,67, Would you marry me? ,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,21,4
7776,Mr. Krabs,67," Ah, that's it! No more hiding in my room like a scared little kid, it's time to act like a man! ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,97,21
7777,Plankton,67, Gasp!,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,6,1
7778,Mr. Krabs,67,"  Please don't marry him, mommy! Don't marry this bad, bad man! I don't want you to!",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,84,16
7779,Plankton,67," Too late Krabsy. We're going to be married. And you're gonna be my new son!  Huh? What's this, honey bunch?",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,108,20
7781,Plankton,67," What is this? There's somebody else, isn't there? ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,51,8
7783,Plankton,67, I don't believe this! You led me on!,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,37,8
7785,Plankton,67, I don't want to hear your lies! You owe me for leading me on like this! Give me the Krabby Patty formula and we'll call it even.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,129,27

7804,SpongeBob,68," Whew, you had me worried there, buddy.  Here's your head. ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,59,10
7805,Patrick,68, I find all this laughter to be highly illogical.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,49,9
7806,SpongeBob,68," Well, let's stop laughin' and start fishing'!  Go ahead, you get first crack.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,78,13
7807,Patrick,68,  Look at them. These graceful stoic creatures of the deep.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,59,10
7808,SpongeBob,68," Huh? Those are some big words, Pat. I've never heard you use them before.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,74,14
7809,Patrick,68," Nonsense, my vocabulary is infinitely expanding.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,49,6
7810,SpongeBob,68," Well, let's expand our jellyfish nets. C'mon, Patrick.  Look buddy, I captured one!",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,84,13
7811,Patrick,68, Yes...  I captured one as well without disturbing its delicate ecosystem. It is wrong to harness nature in such a barbaric manner. ,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,132,22
7812,SpongeBob,68, OK...what do you wanna do?,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,27,5
7813,Patrick,68, Let us go off and admire the beauty and fragility of nature.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,61,12

7818,SpongeBob,68,"  C'mon Patrick, let's do something fun.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,40,6
7819,Patrick,68," Oh, you want to run some statistics or observe phenomenon and render hypothesis of said phenomenon?",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,100,16
7820,SpongeBob,68," I was thinking more like jumping rope , 1-legged races , or playing duck-duck-hermit crab. ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,92,15
7821,Patrick,68, Doesn't feel like fun.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,23,4
7822,SpongeBob,68," How about some jokes?  Patrick, what's the difference between a guitar and a jellyfish?",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,88,14
7823,Patrick,68, You can't strum a jellyfish.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,29,5
7824,SpongeBob,68, Yes! ,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,6,1
7825,Patrick,68," Oh my, look at the time. I really must be going. ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,50,11

7827,Patrick,68, Just studying this amazing sub-species.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,40,5
7828,Plankton,68,  I'll show you subspecies.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,27,4
7829,SpongeBob,68, Wanna visit Squidward?,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,23,3
7830,Patrick,68," Well, since I am finished with my work I'll humor you with your trivial pursuits.  I'd recognize that piece anywhere! Cornelius Pufferfish's Opus 67 symphony in blue.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,167,27
7831,Squidward,68,  Patrick?,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,10,1
7832,Patrick,68, It's a beautiful piece. Execution needs some work.  May I suggest on the 7th bar of the adagio andante that you add a little fortissimo on the arpeggiated b-flat scale.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,169,30
7833,Squidward,68," Wow, I never thought to do it like that.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,41,9
7834,Patrick,68," Well, that is because you rarely think.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,40,7
7835,SpongeBob,68, How do you know so much about music?,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,37,8
7836,Patrick,68, A creative outlet provides a spiritual release and helps facilitate a healthy mental balance.  Ah.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,99,15
7837,SpongeBob,68, Does that include...  belch-talk-ing?,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,38,4
7838,Patrick,68,"  Mr. SquarePants, I find your humor vulgar.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,44,7
7839,Squidward,68," I had no idea you were so knowledgeable, Patrick. Do you think you can be my musical mentor?",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,93,18
7840,SpongeBob,68," Uhh, guys?",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,11,2
7841,Patrick,68," Let's take it from the top.  Not so excellent, Squidward. Let me demonstrate the proper technique.  On second thought, practice makes perfect. Let's begin.  Thank you, my good chap. Unfortunately, this is a solo piece for clarinet only. And 1, 2, 3, 4...  Stop! Enough!  Find yourself a new mentor!",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,299,50
7842,SpongeBob,68," Now that you have some free-time, let's get some grub.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,55,10
7843,Patrick,68," No, SpongeBob, I'm afraid not.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,31,5
7844,SpongeBob,68," Well, I have a brand new bottle of super-bubbly bubble soap. ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,62,11
7845,Patrick,68,"  No, thanks again.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,19,3
7846,SpongeBob,68," Well, maybe later we can play pirates.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,39,7
7847,Patrick,68," Robert, my dear, it's no use. We've just grown apart.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,54,10
7848,SpongeBob,68, What? What do you mean?,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,24,5
7849,Patrick,68, I know we've had fun in the past but we're just not compatible anymore. It's time we went our separate ways...such is life.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,124,23
7850,SpongeBob,68,  But Patrick... you're my best friend.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,39,6
7851,Patrick,68, I know it's hard but brace up chap.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,36,8
7852,SpongeBob,68, Yeah.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,6,1
7853,Patrick,68," Maybe our paths will cross again someday. Think fondly of me, Mr. SquarePants.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,79,13
7854,SpongeBob,68," Goodbye, Mr... Best friend!  Sandy, you there? I need some professional help.  Patrick?",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,88,13

7856,Patrick,68," Why, thank you, Sandra. I find your intellect rather stimulating as well.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,74,12
7857,Sandy,68," Oh, really? Well, thanks.  Well, Patrick, what do you think about this problem?",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,80,13
7858,Patrick,68,  You simply change the literal term to a coefficient and the minuend will achieve the desired quotient. Even the simplest of mammals can figure it out with a little thought.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,174,30
7859,Sandy,68,"  What do you mean by that, Patrick?",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,36,7
7860,Patrick,68, I'm merely suggesting you lack the ability to solve remedial equations.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,72,11
7861,Sandy,68, Are you suggesting I'm dumb?,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,29,5
7862,Patrick,68, I'd use a more sophisticated word like 'impaired'.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,51,8
7863,Sandy,68, I think you'd better leave!,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,28,5
7864,Patrick,68, I was only trying to help. ,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,28,6
7865,Sandy,68," I don't need your kind of help, Mr. know-it-all. I liked you better when you were a barnacle head!",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,99,19
7866,SpongeBob,68,  I never thought I'd lose my best friend. How can I compete with geniusness? Ohhhhhh!,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,86,15
7867,Patrick,68,  Surrounded by knowledge and no one to share it with. No one I can call friend. Who's that old chap I used to run with?  SpongeBob.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,132,26
7868,SpongeBob,68,"  Well, at least Patrick's my friend in my memories. ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,53,9
7869,Patrick,68," Aww, the glory days, why have we grown apart? I must apply all that I know to solve this problem!  What could it be?  What's different? Ah!  What?! I'd do anything to have my old buddy back by my side again!",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,208,41
7870,SpongeBob,68,"  Coming...  Patrick, you're kidnapping me?",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,43,5
7871,Patrick,68," Yes, I am.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,11,3
7872,SpongeBob,68, Yay!  What should we do?,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,25,5
7873,Patrick,68, We are going to have fun. Whatever the cost may be.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,52,11
7874,SpongeBob,68, Let's do this.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,15,3
7875,Patrick,68," Yes, let's have some fun.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,26,5
7876,SpongeBob,68,"  Oh, yeah!",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,11,2
7877,Patrick,68,"  Oh, absolutely!  Are you quite sure I found this activity to be fun?",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,70,13
7878,SpongeBob,68," Yeah.  That was fun, huh Patrick?",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,34,6
7879,Patrick,68,"  When did the fun go away, SpongeBob?",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,38,7
7880,SpongeBob,68, It went away when you jumped off that cliff and knocked your head clean off.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,77,15

8188,Mr. Krabs,71," Now remember, nothing's too good for me little Pearl. I wanted to give her nothing, but she's too good for that. Now follow her around and see what she likes. You know, do some detective work.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,193,36
8189,SpongeBob,71, Detective work--I'm going undercover.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,38,4
8192,SpongeBob,71,  Angela likes Brad.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,20,3
8194,SpongeBob,71,  I'd like to buy that piece of plastic with this piece of plastic. ,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,68,13

8218,Mr. Krabs,71, Hey...maybe I should have hired that ice sculptor.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,51,8
8219,Squidward,71, Ice sculptor? Any fool can sculpt in ice. It takes true genius to transform 400 pounds of raw Krabby Patties into a work of such majesty.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,138,26
8220,Mr. Krabs,71," Yeah. Well, we've got the decor covered. Now how about entertainment? Pearl wants some boy band called 'Boys Who Cry'.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,119,20
8221,Squidward,71," Boys Who Cry? They're my favorite band. They charge a million dollars just to show up. And if you want them to lip-sync, it'll run into real money.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,148,28

8233,Mr. Krabs,71, Everybody get into position. ,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,30,4
8238,Squidward,71, It is dishwater. ,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,18,3
8240,Mr. Krabs,71, Who wants cake?,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,16,3
8242,Mr. Krabs,71, And frosting.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,14,2
8245,Mr. Krabs,71," Oh, even better sweetie. Hit it. ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,34,6
8246,Squidward,71," Hello, ladies.  When my tear ducts get issue, I can't use just any tissue... I need 4-ply, 4-Ply, 4-Ply, when I cry... Huh!",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,124,23
8253,Mr. Krabs,71," Pearl, come back. ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,19,3

8335,SpongeBob,72,"  Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs, no can do.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,38,8
8336,Mr. Krabs,72,  What? Are you going against your commanding officer?,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,54,8
8337,SpongeBob,72," No, it's not that. It's just that this is a highly developed piece of engineering that takes quality time to master.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,117,21
8338,Mr. Krabs,72," With that fancy machinery, I expect you to make Krabby Patties twice as fast.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,78,14
8339,SpongeBob,72," Oh, I don't think that'll be a problem, Mr. Krabs. In fact... ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,63,12
8341,Mr. Krabs,72," Huh, impressive. Well, let's see that thing impress me even more by bringing in more customers and more money in me pocket. ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,125,22

8344,Squidward,72," SpongeBob, I need one Krabby Patty.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,36,6
8345,SpongeBob,72,"  One Krabby Patty, coming up lickity split.  Spat, is there something wrong, pal?",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,82,13
8347,SpongeBob,72," But, but, I thought we were friends.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,37,7
8349,SpongeBob,72," Le Spatula, wait. I gave up everything for you. We had something. ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,67,12
8351,Mr. Krabs,72, What happened?,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,15,2
8352,SpongeBob,72," Le Spatula is gone, Mr. Krabs.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,31,6
8353,Mr. Krabs,72, Well how are you gonna make Krabby Patties WITHOUT A SPATULA?!,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,63,11
8354,SpongeBob,72," I had a spatula once. A real spatula. One that stood by me through thick and thin, through grease and gristle, and I betrayed his loyalty, like a fool!",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,152,29
8355,Mr. Krabs,72, I always did like your old spatular. It got the job done every time.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,69,14
8356,SpongeBob,72," You're right, Mr. Krabs. The true measure of a good spatula is by his actions. Not by some fancy chrome and buttons. I gotta find my old spatula.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,146,28
8357,Mr. Krabs,72," Go to em. Go now, boy. Go before I lose all me customers. ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,59,13
8358,SpongeBob,72, Spatula?? It can't be true. It's too late! ,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,44,8
8360,SpongeBob,72, I know. He's moved on to the big kitchen drawer in the sky. Hes gone! ,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,71,15
8362,SpongeBob,72," Oh, I'm so sorry. ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,19,4
8364,SpongeBob,72,"  Spatula!  Oh, buddy! Oh, I'm so glad you're better!  Spatula, what's wrong?  But I didn't mean to betray you. Mr Krabs needed a replacement. Krabby patties don't flip themselves, you know. It was a moment of weakness. I'm sorry-y-y-y! Oh, what have I done? What have I done? ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,277,48
8365,SpongeBob,72," Good-bye, best friend.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,23,3
8366,SpongeBob,72," I'll never find another spatula like him, again which means the Krusty Krab is out of business.  Spatula? You're back!  Oh, spatula, now that we're together again, nothing will ever separate us.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,195,32
8367,Squidward,72, One monster Krabby Patty. ,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,27,4
8368,SpongeBob,72," Okay, buddy, we can do this. Ready? One, two, three.  D'oh! ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,61,11
8375,Plankton,73,  I surrender!,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,14,2
8376,Mr. Krabs,73," Eh? I wonder what form of trickery is up that miniature cyclops' sleeve this time.  Alright, Plankton, I don't know what you're trying to pull on me, but I'll tell ya right now, it ain't going to work.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,202,38
8377,Plankton,73," There's no pulling, Krabs. Can't you see my peace offering?",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,60,10
8378,Mr. Krabs,73," What is this?  Ha-ha! Very funny, Plankton! But you're gonna have to do a lot better than taking a stab at my illiteracy to offend me.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,135,26
8379,Plankton,73," Don't you get it, Krabs? I give up. I'm through competing with you!",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,68,13
8380,Mr. Krabs,73, But what about all those fevered attempts at trying to steal my Krabby Patty recipe?,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,85,15
8381,Plankton,73, Exactly! They've all been just attempts. And every single one a miserable failure. I can feel my arteries clogging up with anxiety just thinking about it.  Let me show you something.  Look at this place!,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,204,35
8382,Mr. Krabs,73,"  Criminy, Plankton, you ever heard of spring cleaning?",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,55,8
8383,Plankton,73, What's the point? Do you know when the last time I had a customer was?,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,71,15
8384,Mr. Krabs,73," Actually, I don't recall you ever having a customer.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,53,9
8385,Plankton,73," Well, there he is.  That's why I've decided to quit the restaurant business altogether, and turn the Chum Bucket into...  this!",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,128,21
8386,Mr. Krabs,73, You want to turn your restaurant into a pile of junk?,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,54,11
8387,Plankton,73, No! These are knickknacks for the new gift shop I'm opening up.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,64,12
8388,Mr. Krabs,73,"  Come on, this has got to be a joke, right?",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,44,10
8389,Plankton,73," I'm serious, Krabs. Soon the Chum Bucket will be a nice little store for bric-a-brac and bubblegum.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,100,17
8390,Mr. Krabs,73," All right, Plankton. But be aware, I'm not letting my guard down.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,66,12
8391,Plankton,73," Guard away, my ex-enemy. I'll just be here starting my new competition-free career. ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,85,13
8392,SpongeBob,73, What's going on Mr. Krabs?,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,27,5
8393,Mr. Krabs,73, Plankton's concocting another hair-brained scheme to steal me recipe. So keep your eyes peeled.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,96,14
8394,SpongeBob,73," Whatever you say, cap'n. ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,26,4
8395,Plankton,73," Ah, would you look at that? I have a feeling I'm going to like this new life of novelty items.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,95,20
8396,Mr. Krabs,73," Uh-huh. Clever, Plankton! Two can play at this game.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,53,9
8397,SpongeBob,73,"  Mr. Krabs, look at this cool knickknack I got at the Chumporium.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,66,12
8398,Mr. Krabs,73,"  Hmm, I know there's a microphone or camera in here somewhere. ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,64,11
8399,SpongeBob,73," Uhh, Mr Krabs, I really don't think there's anything weird in there.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,69,12
8400,Mr. Krabs,73," Eh, we'll see about that.  I'll just put this in here for safekeeping. You here that, Plankton?! Join your other friends from the past.  Now nobody's getting to see anything. Don't you understand this is all part of his ruse. It's just cosmetic. He thinks he can take us out. But we'll show him. We're gonna out-fake the faker. Well, it looks like old Plankton is really going through with it. I guess we don't have to worry about him anymore. Yup, we sure whipped him this time. Okay, boys, the coast is clear. Plankton's turned over a new leaf.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,547,100
8401,SpongeBob,73," That's some good news, Mr. Krabs.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,34,6
8402,Mr. Krabs,73," It sure is, you little half-wit. And you know what else is good news? We can finally use that DJ system. Hit it, SpongeBob.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,124,24
8403,SpongeBob,73," Right away, sir.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,17,3
8404,Mr. Krabs,73," Let's party!   Ow! I won! It's time to boogie. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,77,14
8405,Squidward,73, This is idiotic.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,17,3
8406,Mr. Krabs,73, Dance or you're fired.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,23,4
8407,Squidward,73," You got it, Mr. Krabs. ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,24,5
8408,Mr. Krabs,73,"  How do you like them apples, you little... ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,45,8
8409,Plankton,73,"  Come on, buddy, let's get some shut eye. We have a big day ahead of us at the Chumporium Gift Shop.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,101,21
8410,Mr. Krabs,73," Wait a minute.  What the...?  Store shelves? Novelty toys? Lava lamps?  Useless knickknacks? Very convincing. But I'm still not buying it. You want a battle, Plankton? I'm gonna give you a war. ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,195,32
8411,Plankton,73, Ah. A clean snow globe is a happy snow globe. ,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,47,10
8412,Mr. Krabs,73," Plankton! You may have fooled everyone else, you might have even fooled yourself, but you ain't fooling me.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,108,18
8413,Plankton,73," Oh, I get it. You caught me red-handed.  Those were the days, huh Eugene?",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,74,14
8414,Mr. Krabs,73, Grr...,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,7,1
8415,Plankton,73, But I found there more to life than just trying to steal your formula. And I found it all right here in novelty items.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,119,24
8416,Mr. Krabs,73, Bubkes.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,8,1
8417,Plankton,73," Ah, Eugene. Stuck in your old ways.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,36,7
8418,Mr. Krabs,73," Bubkes! If there's one thing certain in this world, it's that you can't resist me formula.  You know you want it.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,114,21
8419,Plankton,73," Thanks, but no.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,16,3
8420,Mr. Krabs,73," A-ha, I knew it.  It was all a trick to get me to hand over... Wait, did you say no?",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,85,20
8421,Plankton,73," Well, if you don't believe me, that's your problem not mine.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,61,11
8422,Mr. Krabs,73," Problem?! I don't have a problem! You're the one with the problem! Look at this. It means nothing. It's all a facade, a hoax, a con, a front...  ...a sham, a snow job...  ...bologna with a side of flimflam and an order of Jive! See?! Who's the one with the problem?!",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,267,51
8423,Plankton,73, Look what you've done. This is my livelihood.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,46,8
8424,Mr. Krabs,73," Sure it is. And this isn't the formula that you don't want. Come on, eh? Eh? Oop. Too slow. ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,93,19
8425,Plankton,73,  GET OUT!!,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,11,2
8426,Mr. Krabs,73,"  Oh, I get it. Stick to your guns, and eventually we'll all believe it. Soften us up and when our backs are turned, you'll make your move.  Oops.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,146,28
8427,Plankton,73," What's this?  Hey, Krabs!",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,26,4
8428,Mr. Krabs,73, I knew you'd come back.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,24,5
8429,Plankton,73, You forgot something.  Can't you understand I've wasted so much time chasing after you? And now I have something that's mine. And it makes me happy. ,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,150,26
8430,Mr. Krabs,73, I never thought I'd see the day. What happened to the invertebrate I used to know? Plankton! ,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,94,17
8431,Plankton,73," Coming, coming.  Yo.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,21,3

8437,Plankton,73, Yes. I'm still here.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,21,4
8438,Mr. Krabs,73," Heh, good. Uh...I want to make it up to you. What do you say we grab a soda?",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,77,18
8439,Plankton,73, Sure. ,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,7,1
8440,Mr. Krabs,73," Glad you could make it, buddy.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,31,6
8441,Plankton,73," So, what's this about, Krabs? ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,31,5
8442,Mr. Krabs,73," I figured since we're no longer archenemies, maybe, maybe we can start over.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,77,13
8443,Plankton,73," Yes. Yes, I would like that very much.  I guess I won. ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,56,12
8444,Mr. Krabs,73," Uh, I don't know about this, Plankton.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,39,7
8445,Plankton,73," Oh, come on. Just fall back. Trust me, I'll catch you. ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,56,11

8450,Mr. Krabs,73," No, no. I want you to have this. It's the secret formula.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,58,12
8451,Plankton,73, I can't believe you would even think...,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,40,7
8452,Mr. Krabs,73, Things are different now. Honestly. It would mean a lot to me.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,63,12
8453,Plankton,73," You...you're serious. Eugene, if I take this formula from you now, there will always be a hint of doubt.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,105,19
8454,Mr. Krabs,73," Come on, take it.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,18,4
8455,Plankton,73," You sure?  Life is good, Krabs.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,32,6

8458,Mr. Krabs,73, I never gave you the formula. I fooled you with an even more convoluted charade. ,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,82,15
8465,Mr. Krabs,74, Squidward! SpongeBob! Just put me out of my misery.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,52,9
8466,SpongeBob,74," Why, Mr. Krabs? What could be wrong on this fine day?",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,54,11
8467,Mr. Krabs,74," Fine?!  Today's not the day for that word, boy. Not after I received this letter from the Fry Cooks Union. It says here fry cook SpongeBob SquarePants has accumulated too much vacation time. And if you don't take some time off, I'll have to pay a fine. ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,254,47
8468,SpongeBob,74, Time off?,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,10,2
8469,Mr. Krabs,74," Oh, I guess there's no other way to say this...SpongeBob, take a vacation.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,75,13
8470,SpongeBob,74," Aye aye, Mr. Krabs. ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,21,4
8471,Mr. Krabs,74," Well, that went better than expected.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,38,6
8472,SpongeBob,74,"  I'm ready, vacation. I'm ready, vacation. Vacation. Vacation.  Hey, Gary.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,75,10

8476,Mr. Krabs,74,"  He was and is. I told you to take a vacation, boy.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,52,12
8477,SpongeBob,74, What's a vacation?,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,19,3
8478,Mr. Krabs,74," Well, a vacation is when you don't come into work.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,51,10
8479,SpongeBob,74,  No work?! But what'll I do all day?,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,37,8
8480,Mr. Krabs,74," Oh, I dunno. Just go have fun or whatever. I really don't care. Ya just can't be here.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,87,18
8481,SpongeBob,74, But who will fry the patties and clean the grill while I'm gone? Squidward can't do it all alone.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,98,19
8482,Squidward,74, Nor will I.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,12,3
8483,Mr. Krabs,74, That's why I've hired an unpaid intern as your temporary replacement.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,70,11

8487,Patrick,74," Hi, SpongeBob.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,15,2
8488,Mr. Krabs,74, That's enough banter on my dime.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,33,6
8489,Patrick,74," Ok, boss.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,10,2
8490,Mr. Krabs,74," Wait a second, Patrick. You'll need the right tools for the job. ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,66,12
8491,Patrick,74," Wow.  Huh! They put a tiny me in the belly scratcher.  Wow. It scratches backs, too!",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,85,16
8492,Mr. Krabs,74," Ah, take it from me, SpongeBob. Just go on home. Enjoy your vacation.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,70,13
8493,SpongeBob,74, I really should tell Patrick the proper patty-flipping technique. ,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,67,9
8495,SpongeBob,74," I'm on vacation, Gary. I'm not allowed to go to work.  My stomach has receded! Mr. Krabs said I couldn't work at the Krusty Krab. He didn't say I couldn't eat there. This is my ticket back inside! ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,198,38

8497,SpongeBob,74," I'm not here to see you, Squidward.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,36,7
8498,Mr. Krabs,74," SpongeBob, do we have to go through this again?",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,48,9
8499,SpongeBob,74, I'm here as a customer not as an employee. Just gonna grab a Krabby Patty with Patrick.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,88,17
8500,Mr. Krabs,74," Alright, but lunch only. If you so much as touch a spatuler, you'll be vacationing in Davey Jones' locker.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,107,19
8501,SpongeBob,74," You have my word, sir. No working.  Hey Pat, it's time for your lunch...  Patrick, you can't do that!",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,102,19
8502,Patrick,74, Huh?,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,5,1
8503,SpongeBob,74," You need to turn up the grill to exactly 298 degrees Fahrenheit.  Patrick, this is no way to treat a Krabby Patty.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,115,22
8504,Mr. Krabs,74,  SpongeBob! What did I tell you about working?,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,47,8
8505,SpongeBob,74," Wait, it's not what you think.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,31,6
8506,Mr. Krabs,74,"  Out you go, boy.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,18,4
8507,SpongeBob,74, But my knowledge could help Patrick maintain the high standards of the Krusty Krab.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,84,14
8508,Mr. Krabs,74, We've got it all under control here. I don't want to see hide or tail of ya 'til your vacation is over. You got that?,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,118,25
8509,SpongeBob,74," Yes, Mr. Krabs.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,16,3

8511,SpongeBob,74," Oh, what to do, what to do. I know just the thing to get the spirits up. The official Krusty Krab playset. ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,108,22
8512,Squidward,74,"  SpongeBob, I need 20 Krabby Patties on the double, please.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,60,10
8513,SpongeBob,74," Sure thing, Mr. Squidward, sir. 20 Krabby Patties coming up.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,61,10
8514,Mr. Krabs,74,"  SpongeBob, what are you doing here? You're gonna cost me some loot if you don't get your square keister home. Out, out, out until your vacation is over. ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,155,28
8515,SpongeBob,74,"  Oh, what to do on this boring vacation. Hey, I know just the thing to get the ol' spirits up. ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,96,20

8517,SpongeBob,74," Sure thing, ol' buddy, ol' Squid. 20 Krabby Patties coming...",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,62,10
8519,SpongeBob,74," You're right, Gary. It is unhealthy to think of the Krusty Krab while I'm on vacation. I need to get out of the house. ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,120,24
8520,Squidward,74," Uh, Mr. Krabs, he's out there again.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,37,7
8521,Mr. Krabs,74," I'll deal with this. Boy, you're on Krusty Krab property. Back it up.  Further.  Further.  Further.  Further.  That'll do.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,123,19
8522,SpongeBob,74," Mr. Krabs is right. In order to enjoy my vacation, I need to stay away from work. Physically and mentally.  Hey, that reminds me of...  Hold it right there, Mr. WorkaholicPants. You're on vacation. You just need to sit down and relax.  That's more like it. Just sit back and watch the clouds.  That one's a jellyfish!  That's a pirate ship.  And that's low salt ketchup...whoa! Low salt ketchup?  Got your steaming, hot bun delivery here. ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,440,76
8524,Patrick,74," Hello? Hello? Hello?  Huh, I didn't even know I had an ear.  Hey, I just cleaned that one.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,91,18
8525,SpongeBob,74," Patrick, shhh.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,15,2
8526,Patrick,74, It talks! ,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,11,2
8527,SpongeBob,74," Somebody help, I'm stuck!  Mr. Krabs! Thank Neptune it's you. I'm in a bit of a fix here.  Mr. Krabs?  Noooo!!  Uh oh.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,119,23

8535,SpongeBob,74, Where'd you say you were taking me?,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,36,7
8536,Mr. Krabs,74," Look boy,  I brought your spatuler.  C'mon, boy, get it. Get the spatuler. Go get it!  Enjoy your vacation, boy!",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,113,20
8537,SpongeBob,74," It's not fair. Why would Mr. Krabs try so hard to get rid of me? I'm only on vacation. Unless, it's a...  ...permanent vacation. That's it! Mr. Krabs wants to replace me. Oh, I should've known. Patrick's had his eye on my job all along. He's been scheming. They think I'm outdated. They think I'm all washed up. Well, I'll show them. ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,335,62
8538,Patrick,74," Working at the Krusty Krab. Making krabby patties all day. Flipping Krusty Krab working patties krab...uhh, that's a hard song to remember.  Huh?",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,146,23
8539,SpongeBob,74,  Who do they think they are? I gave the best years of my life to this place and they think they can just fire like that? Like trash? I don't think so!,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,151,32
8540,Patrick,74, SpongeBob? Is that you?,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,24,4
8541,SpongeBob,74,"  I've been waiting for you, Patrick! ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,38,6

8544,Squidward,74, One shell on a shingle. ,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,25,5
8545,Mr. Krabs,74," Well, I'll be...Patrick! Your cooking's improved one-thousand fold. Congratulations, boy, you've finally got the hang of it.  SpongeBob? No wonder. Patrick could never flip that many patties in an hour. What happened to that feller, anyway?",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,241,36
8546,SpongeBob,74," Oh, I told him to stay home and watch television. ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,51,10
8547,Mr. Krabs,74," Why'd you do it, laddy?",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,24,5
8548,SpongeBob,74,"  Oh, Mr Krabs, I love the putrid grease of the Krusty Krab so much, I just couldn't stay away!",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,95,19

8664,SpongeBob,75, SpongeBob to Sandy. We've reached the foreign obstruction.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,59,8
8665,Sandy,75," Okay, you're going to have to go out and dislodge it somehow.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,62,12
8666,SpongeBob,75, I'm already on it.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,19,4
8668,SpongeBob,75, This stupid hammer won't break anything.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,41,6
8669,Patrick,75," SpongeBob, do what you were born to do! Dance!",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,47,9
8670,SpongeBob,75, You're right Patrick. Whirlpool Spin! ,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,39,5
8671,Sandy,75,"  Good work, guys. Mission accomplished.  Now all you have to do is...",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,70,12

8673,Patrick,75, Grow?,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,6,1
8675,Mr. Krabs,75,  Almost ready to open.  There.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,31,5
8676,Squidward,75," Good morning, Mr. Krabs.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,25,4

8679,Patrick,75,"  Squidward, the toilet's backed up again.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,42,6
8686,Squidward,76," It's too quiet. Something isn't right around here.  Could it be? SpongeBob is gone for the evening.  Here's to a delightful evening alone with you, public television. ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,168,27
8687,Patrick,76, Do it again. Do it again.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,26,6
8688,SpongeBob,76, Ok. ,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,5,1
8689,Squidward,76, Will you two be quiet?! I'm trying to watch public television. ,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,64,11
8690,Patrick,76," Do it again, do it again.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,26,6
8691,Squidward,76," If those two want to ruin my quiet evening at home, they're going to have to do better than that.  What?",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,105,21
8692,SpongeBob,76, Squidward! ,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,12,1
8693,Squidward,76," You're still there, aren't you? ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,33,5
8694,SpongeBob,76," Good evening, Squidward.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,25,3
8695,Squidward,76, Not so fast. You two little monsters aren't about to ruin my evening.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,70,13
8696,SpongeBob,76," Oh, we're not here to ruin it. We're here to enhance it. Isn't that right, Pat?",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,80,16
8697,Patrick,76, Yeah. We're here... ,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,21,3
8698,Squidward,76," Can't a hard working Squid get a little TV time alone?  SpongeBob? Patrick? Oh, what's the point? ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,99,17
8699,Patrick,76, Could you turn it up?,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,22,5
8700,SpongeBob,76," Uh, Squidward, could you turn it down a little?",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,48,9
8701,Patrick,76," Squidward, what's this about?",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,30,4
8702,SpongeBob,76," Squidward, how come he's so emotional?",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,39,6
8703,Patrick,76, Is he the bad guy?,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,19,5
8704,SpongeBob,76, Squidward?,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,11,1
8705,Patrick,76, Squidward?,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,11,1
8706,SpongeBob,76, Squidward?,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,11,1
8707,Patrick,76, Squidward?,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,11,1
8708,SpongeBob,76, Squidward?,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,11,1
8709,Patrick,76, Squidward?,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,11,1
8710,Squidward,76,"  That's it! All I wanted to do was watch some smooth jazz on public television. But apparently, that's not going to happen. Once again I'm going to have to leave my own home just to get some peace and quiet. Enjoy my TV. ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,222,43
8711,Patrick,76," Oh wait, I think I've seen this before. This part's funny.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,59,11
8712,Squidward,76," I'm going to go somewhere far away. Somewhere far away from those two watching public television on my TV. Pfah! They wouldn't know real culture even if it hit them like a truck full of cement.  Oh.  Day five, I think. I've been waddling these fields. I'm hungry, tired, and lost. The only good thing about this is no SpongeBob.  Jellyfish Fields. ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,349,62
8713,SpongeBob,76," What is that thing, Patrick?",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,29,5
8714,Patrick,76, I dunno. Let's get a closer look. ,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,35,7
8715,SpongeBob,76," Hi, stranger. I am SpongeBob.  Wait a minute. Maybe he's not a monster. Maybe he's an endangered species. We should help him.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,126,22
8716,Patrick,76," Yeah, help him. Go away. Can't you tell nobody wants you? You're endangered.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,77,13
8717,SpongeBob,76," Not like that. With lots of love and affection. We can take care of him.  Well, Smelly, here you are. Your new home. Oh, Smelly, this is going to be great. We'll be one big happy family. Let me show you around. Here's your bed, Smelly.  Here's your food bowl.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,260,50
8718,Patrick,76, And some kibble. ,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,18,3
8719,SpongeBob,76," You can live here forever and ever.  Oh, look, Pat. He's crying tears of joy. Well, Smelly, there's one more family member you haven't met.  Smelly meet Gary.  Aww, look at that Smelly, Gary likes you.  Gary, no!  Gary. ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,221,39
8720,Patrick,76, I don't think Gary likes Smelly.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,33,6
8721,SpongeBob,76," Yeah, Gary's never attacked anyone like that except Squidward. I guess Smelly can't live here.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,95,15
8722,Patrick,76, Ah! He can come home with me.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,30,7
8723,SpongeBob,76," That's a great idea, Patrick. You always wanted a pet.  Isn't that cute? Look how excited he is to get to your house.  Bye, Smelly, have fun at Patrick's. ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,156,29
8724,Patrick,76," No, no, Smelly. Squidward doesn't like pets.  Hey, Smelly, wanna play catch?  Don't worry, you'll get the hang of it.  Almost.  Again.  So close.  Yeah, now you're...  Smelly! What's gotten into you?!  Hello, Animal Control? There's a wild animal loose in my house.  Sure, I'll hold.  Smelly! Come back. Smelly!",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,312,50
8726,SpongeBob,76,"  Hmmm, what's all the commotion? ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,34,5
8728,SpongeBob,76," Smelly.  Excuse me. Pardon me. If I can just scootch through there. Excuse me. Pardon me. Excuse me. You leave Smelly alone. He's just a poor, dumb wild animal.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,161,29
8730,SpongeBob,76, Smelly. ,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,9,1
8733,SpongeBob,76, This isn't good.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,17,3
8734,Patrick,76, You're absolutely right.  It needs mustard.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,44,6
8735,SpongeBob,76," No one should be treated like that. Not even someone as ugly as Smelly. Something needs to be done about this. And I know exactly what that thing is.  Ok, Patrick, remember the plan?",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,183,34
8736,Patrick,76," Oh, yeah.  This one, right?",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,28,5
8737,SpongeBob,76,"  No, not that. I'm talking about the plan to break Smelly out of this animal prison.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,85,16
8738,Patrick,76,"  Mmm, good plan.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,17,3
8739,SpongeBob,76,"  All right, I'll go down first. Keep a lookout and follow me. ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,63,12
8740,Patrick,76, You're my hero.  SpongeBob! Help! Ah! ,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,39,6
8741,SpongeBob,76," Shh, we'll get caught.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,23,4
8742,Patrick,76, What! I can't hear you! I'm screaming too loud! ,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,49,9
8743,SpongeBob,76,"  Fear no longer, dear Smelly, we are here to rescue you. Understand? We are taking you home.  Look how excited he is. Flip the switch, Patrick.  Smelly, you're free! ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,167,29
8745,SpongeBob,76," Run, Patrick, run!  Faster, Patrick. ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,38,5
8746,Patrick,76, I'll let Smelly go first. ,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,27,5
8747,SpongeBob,76," Don't worry, Smelly, you're safe with us. ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,43,7
8748,Patrick,76, I think we lost them.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,22,5
8749,SpongeBob,76," Well, we're all one big happy family again. Let's see where this dark sewer tunnel leads.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,90,16
8751,SpongeBob,76," Oh, it's all right, Smelly. Soon, we'll be home and you can sleep in that cozy little pet carrier you love so much. ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,117,23
8752,Patrick,76," Hey, I see light.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,18,4
8753,SpongeBob,76," You're right, Patrick. That must be the way out. Whoa... where are we?  Let's go ask those guys. Um, excuse us.  Hey, they look just like you. Go, be with your real family. Go ahead, Smelly. I know you've come to think of us as a family, but it's better this way. ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,265,52
8754,Patrick,76,"  I'm going to miss him, SpongeBob. Me, too, buddy. Me, too, but he's with his kind now, where he belongs, and on that note, let us go back to where we belong. ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,160,32
8756,Squidward,76,  Um... hi.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,11,2
8764,SpongeBob,77," I'm ready!  I'm ready! I'm ready! Patrick, did you bring my flashcards?",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,72,12
8765,Patrick,77," Right here, buddy.  Everything you need to pass the test is on these cards.  Mmm.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,82,15
8766,SpongeBob,77," No, Patrick!",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,13,2
8767,Patrick,77," Hey, learning tastes good.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,27,4
8768,SpongeBob,77," Patrick, I needed those.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,25,4

8770,SpongeBob,77, 57 times.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,10,2
8771,Patrick,77," Well, then 58 is your lucky number. You're gonna pass that driving test, SpongeBob, because you're a winner.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,109,18
8772,SpongeBob,77, I'm a winner?,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,14,3
8773,Patrick,77, Who's a winner?,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,16,3
8774,SpongeBob,77,  I'm a winner.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,15,3
8775,Patrick,77, Who's a winner?,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,16,3
8776,SpongeBob,77,  I'm a winner.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,15,3
8777,Patrick,77, Who's a winner?!,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,17,3
8778,SpongeBob,77, I'm a winner! I'm a winner! I'm a winner! ,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,43,9
8780,Patrick,77," How'd you do, winner?  Let's see that license.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,47,8
8781,SpongeBob,77," I didn't get a license, Patrick.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,33,6
8782,Patrick,77, Are they gonna mail it to you?,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,31,7
8783,SpongeBob,77," No, Patrick, I failed the boating test. I guess 58 wasn't my lucky number after all.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,85,16
8784,Patrick,77," No way! 58 is, like, the luckiest number ever! The test must be rigged.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,72,14
8785,SpongeBob,77," Let's just go home, Patrick.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,29,5
8786,Patrick,77," We're not going anywhere until I get to the bottom of this. I'm taking that test, myself.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,90,17
8787,SpongeBob,77,"  No, Patrick! I've been training for years. They'll eat you alive. ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,68,11

8789,SpongeBob,77," No, Patrick. No!",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,17,3
8791,Patrick,77, You're not the judge of me.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,28,6
8793,SpongeBob,77, I shouldn't have let him do it. What kind of friend am I?,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,58,13
8794,Patrick,77, SpongeBob! SpongeBob!,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,22,2
8795,SpongeBob,77," I'm here for you, buddy.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,25,5
8796,Patrick,77, I passed my test!,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,18,4

8817,SpongeBob,77," Right, Patrick. I can't think of one thing that would make this day better. Except maybe getting my license.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,109,19
8818,Patrick,77, Maybe if you apply yourself you could be the two millionth person to get his license.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,86,16
8819,SpongeBob,77, Two millionth?,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,15,2
8820,Patrick,77, Then you can get a free boat just like me.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,43,10
8821,SpongeBob,77," Yeah, just like you.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,21,4
8822,Patrick,77, I try to serve as an inspiration to others.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,44,9

8838,SpongeBob,77, Thanks for the ride.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,21,4

8842,SpongeBob,77, When did we get a drive-thru?,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,30,6
8843,Mr. Krabs,77, I realized there's a lot of young people on the go these days. They don't have time to sit down and eat. They're too busy out on the open road living their dreams.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,164,33
8844,SpongeBob,77, I used to have a dream.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,24,6
8845,Mr. Krabs,77, Yeah? I used to have a kidney stone. Everything passes eventually. Now stop dreaming and work for a living.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,108,19

8871,Patrick,77, What? Where? Who?,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,18,3
8872,SpongeBob,77," Officer, it is my civilian duty to report that the the driver of this vehicle is speeding. Why don't you clock him with your radar gun?",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,136,26
8874,SpongeBob,77," Are you sure you don't want to run him in?  It's a red light, Patrick!  Patrick, you just ran 3 red lights!",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,108,22

8879,Patrick,77, They ran for it in time. What are you so mad about?,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,52,12
8880,SpongeBob,77," I should've gotten that license, and this should be my boat mobile!",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,68,12
8881,Patrick,77," How can you say that?! If you were my friend, you'd be happy for me getting my license!",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,88,18
8882,SpongeBob,77," If you were my friend, you wouldn't rub your license in my face!",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,65,13
8883,Patrick,77, I'm not rubbing my license in your face! This is rubbing my license in your face! ,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,83,16
8884,SpongeBob,77," Oh, give me that! I worked my whole life for this! You don't deserve this! ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,76,15

8891,Patrick,77, I don't know! I don't have a license anymore. ,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,47,9
8893,Patrick,77," So long, buddy. Don't forget to feed Gary. Sometimes you forget to feed him.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,77,14
8894,SpongeBob,77, What have I done? Patrick can't survive in prison. He's too soft. Wait!  Patrick's innocent. I tore up Patrick's license and threw it out the window. I'm the litterbug. Take me instead.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,186,32
8897,SpongeBob,77, Patrick!,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,9,1

8899,Patrick,77," Oh, I don't have a boat mobile anymore.",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,40,8
8900,SpongeBob,77, What?,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,6,1
8901,Patrick,77, It stopped working so I threw it away. The needle was on E and I figured that must mean end.,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,93,20
8902,SpongeBob,77," Oh, then what do we do with this? ",4,SpongeBob SquarePants,35,8
8903,Patrick,77, How's that?,4,SpongeBob SquarePants,12,2

10820,Sandy,94, Yee-haw! Get along little fishies.,5,SpongeBob SquarePants,35,5
10821,SpongeBob,94," Hi, Sandy.",5,SpongeBob SquarePants,11,2
10822,Sandy,94," Whoa!  Hot cat snake in a barn. Look at your eye. Land sakes. That's quite a shiner you got there. Well, don't you worry none. I know some natural remedies that'll...",5,SpongeBob SquarePants,167,31
10823,SpongeBob,94, Keep your natural remedies to yourself. Manly dudes like me don't need 'em. I'll have you know that I got this black eye in a fight.,5,SpongeBob SquarePants,133,26
10824,Sandy,94," A fight? Well, there's no shame in losing.",5,SpongeBob SquarePants,43,8
10825,SpongeBob,94," Lose? Sandy, I taught the fish who tangled with me a lesson he shan't soon forget.",5,SpongeBob SquarePants,83,16
10826,Sandy,94, Why? Did he write it down?,5,SpongeBob SquarePants,27,6
10827,SpongeBob,94," No, I engraved it on his pain gland.",5,SpongeBob SquarePants,37,8
10828,Sandy,94," Well, what type of man scuffles boots with you and loses?",5,SpongeBob SquarePants,58,11
10829,SpongeBob,94," Oh, this was no mere man. He was the notorious outlaw Jack M. Crazfish!",5,SpongeBob SquarePants,72,14
10830,Sandy,94, Jack M. Crazyfish?,5,SpongeBob SquarePants,19,3
10831,SpongeBob,94," It all happened late last night...  I was walking home from work... alone when all of a sudden, Crazyfish sprang up out of nowhere. He threw a giant tire at the back of my head.  Then, he stood over me to gloat. I jumped up and karate kicked his hairpiece right off of its snaps.  He was so ashamed he ran all the way home leaving behind a pool of tears. Which I then proceeded to scoop up in my victory tankard and enjoy a nice refreshing beverage.",5,SpongeBob SquarePants,450,88
10832,Sandy,94, So how'd you get the black eye then?,5,SpongeBob SquarePants,37,8
10833,SpongeBob,94," Oh, yeah, that's right. I had miscalculated the trajectory of my cup and the straw jabbed me in the eye, giving me this awful shiner. ",5,SpongeBob SquarePants,135,25
10834,Sandy,94," Well, looks like you're late for your day job, killer.",5,SpongeBob SquarePants,55,10
10835,SpongeBob,94," Ah, phooey. Late schmate. A tough guy like me can show up to work whenever he wants. Adios. ",5,SpongeBob SquarePants,93,18
10836,Mr. Krabs,94," SpongeBob is 13-1/2 minutes late for duty. I hope for his sake this means he was in a horrible accident.  Well, looks like I was right about the accident part. ",5,SpongeBob SquarePants,161,30
10838,SpongeBob,94," Yeah, that's right, pal, do the right thing. Just keep on walking. ",5,SpongeBob SquarePants,68,12
10840,SpongeBob,94, That's right. ,5,SpongeBob SquarePants,15,2
10841,Squidward,94," SpongeBob, I'm...",5,SpongeBob SquarePants,18,2
10842,SpongeBob,94," Dah-dah-dah-dah, I'm just gonna stop you right there, Squidward. Spare you the oxygen. We all know you weaker folk can't afford to waste it.  All right, folks, listen up 'cause I'm only gonna say this once. Tough guys don't like to repeat themselves. I'm talking to you, grandma!  Now I suppose all of you are wondering how I got this black eye.",5,SpongeBob SquarePants,346,62
10843,Squidward,94, Not really.,5,SpongeBob SquarePants,12,2
10844,SpongeBob,94," All right, who said that? Was it you, grandma?",5,SpongeBob SquarePants,47,9
10845,Squidward,94," It was me, I said it. ",5,SpongeBob SquarePants,23,6
10846,SpongeBob,94," Well, folks, I don't happen to see it as a shiner so much as a shining trophy of my glorious triumph over the forces of evil. Oh, I know what you're thinking. Who in the name of Neptune would want to tangle with a guy like SpongeBob SquarePants? Well, I'll tell you who.  It was a peaceful morning in Bikini Bottom. I emerged from my fruit-shaped bungalow fresh as a bee when a wanted cry of distress pounded against my eardrum. ",5,SpongeBob SquarePants,430,81
10848,Mr. Krabs,94, He's right.,5,SpongeBob SquarePants,12,2
10849,SpongeBob,94," Hey, let's save all the questions until the end. As I was saying... I quickly located the source of the cry which was a victim tied at my feet.  ""Don't worry, I'll save you."" I assured... when a large bowling pin struck me in the face. The hurler was none other than Jack M. Crazyfish. And I could tell by that cold sore on his lip that today he meant business. With cat-like reflexes I preempted his attack. But the scoundrel had me sabotaged. And I fell face down on a pile of extra large staples. He lunged at me but I got him in the ribs with my novelty feather duster. Down he fell like a mighty oak.  And there he lay. The very thought of being vanquished made Jack M. Crazyfish burst into tears.  The force of his tears was so strong I had to take evasive action. But one of the blasts went haywire and hit me right in the face...  ...and that's how I got this black eye and gave Jack M. Crazyfish a whomping of a lifetime. Whoo...football!",5,SpongeBob SquarePants,948,183
10851,SpongeBob,94," Oh, kind of tall, handlebar mustache...",5,SpongeBob SquarePants,40,6
10853,SpongeBob,94," I kind of thought it was teal but that sounds like him all right. Wait a second, how did you know he was wearing a green hat?  He's... real.",5,SpongeBob SquarePants,141,29
10855,SpongeBob,94," Mr Crazyfish, please don't skin me alive. I made all that stuff up. I was just kidding about whomping you, right folks? You remember.",5,SpongeBob SquarePants,134,24
10857,SpongeBob,94," Hi, Gary.  All right, look. I had a toothpaste tube, like this. But I couldn't get it open 'cause the cap was stuck. And I guess...I haven't been working my arms out that much lately. And I opened it up like this...  Then I was walkin', like this.  And I didn't see where the cap went, like this.  So, I slipped on it and I landed right on my wrench, like this. And I gave myself a black eye, like this.  Uh... like these.  So you see? I made it all up so I could keep from looking stupid. Makes sense, doesn't it?",5,SpongeBob SquarePants,515,103
10859,SpongeBob,94," One super hot and delicious custom order Krabby Patty with extra sauce, mi lord. Served directly to your waiting  Head and neck area. Sir, please, I am so sorry.",5,SpongeBob SquarePants,162,29
10861,SpongeBob,94, Noooooooo!...,5,SpongeBob SquarePants,14,1
10868,Patrick,95," Hey, SpongeBob!  SpongeBob!  You forgot to tell me you're leaving! ",5,SpongeBob SquarePants,68,10
10869,SpongeBob,95," Well Patrick, I guess...  I did. ",5,SpongeBob SquarePants,34,6
10870,Patrick,95," I'm gonna miss you, buddy!",5,SpongeBob SquarePants,27,5
10871,Patrick,95," Well, see you later, bud. ",5,SpongeBob SquarePants,27,5
10872,SpongeBob,95," Patrick, That's it! You can come with me to summer camp! Then I'd never have to say goodbye!",5,SpongeBob SquarePants,93,18
10873,Patrick,95, Summer camp? But I'm not even ready yet!,5,SpongeBob SquarePants,41,8
10874,SpongeBob,95, How about now?,5,SpongeBob SquarePants,15,3
10875,Patrick,95, Yep! ,5,SpongeBob SquarePants,6,1
10876,SpongeBob,95,"  ...this stuff is just my carry-on, quarter.  The rest of my things are right over there. ",5,SpongeBob SquarePants,91,16
10877,Patrick,95, Weee! Haha!,5,SpongeBob SquarePants,12,2

10891,SpongeBob,95, This camp is very upscale! ,5,SpongeBob SquarePants,28,5
10892,Patrick,95, I had no idea that they had a hot tub! ,5,SpongeBob SquarePants,40,10
10895,SpongeBob,95," It was quite an enjoyable soap, but it wasn't until this guy got thirsty and decided to drink the bath water!",5,SpongeBob SquarePants,110,21
10896,Patrick,95, Not bad! Except for this aftertaste. ,5,SpongeBob SquarePants,38,6
10899,SpongeBob,95," This is a pretty fun camp game, huh Patrick?",5,SpongeBob SquarePants,45,9
10900,Patrick,95, Yeah!,5,SpongeBob SquarePants,6,1
10901,SpongeBob,95, It's made it even more fun and challenging by the fact that we're wearing these heavy ankle weights. ,5,SpongeBob SquarePants,102,18
10903,Patrick,95," What's wrong, SpongeBob? ",5,SpongeBob SquarePants,26,3
10904,SpongeBob,95, The other campers just aren't having as much fun as you and me.,5,SpongeBob SquarePants,64,13

11844,Plankton,103," Oh, just the usual ingredients. Some jellyfish squeezings, whale blubber, sea horse snout, and a sprinkle of anchor rust. ",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,123,19
11846,Plankton,103," Now, I've been waiting for 20 years to have the amount of customers Krabs sees everyday! And I won't let that be ruined because the show's ""boring"", or the food's ""inedible."" So sit down, enjoy the show and buy some chum! ",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,223,41
11847,SpongeBob,103, What do we do now Patrick?,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,27,6
11848,Patrick,103," Don't worry, I'm all ready doing it. ",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,38,7
11849,SpongeBob,103," NO!  Patrick, now is not the time for eating, now is the time to avoid being eaten by that giant... Huh?  That's it Patrick! He's not chasing us, he's chasing those tasty, tender, delicious, succulent sausages around your neck. ",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,229,39
11850,Plankton,103," Chum on a stick. Get your chum.  What the?  Oh great! Now how am I going to entertain the masses?  Hey watch where you're...  Oh dear!  Phew. Good thing I thought ahead, with that escape door. Try and catch me now, you prissy feline!  NO! Nice kitty. Want some chum? ",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,268,50
11851,Mr. Krabs,103," You know I'm not one to give out comments likely, I've gotta hand it to you boy,  if you didn't throw those sausages into the audience, we would have been dead meat!",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,166,32
11852,SpongeBob,103, My pleasure captain!,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,21,3
11853,Patrick,103," Yeah, thanks buddy! You really saved my behind! No joke! ",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,58,10
11854,Mr. Krabs,103," I think that it's safe to say, that no matter how diabolical Plankton's plans may be, he'll never have the loyalty, of me good customers.",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,138,25
11856,Mr. Krabs,103," But of course, my good customer. That'll be ten dollars.",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,57,10
11858,Mr. Krabs,103," Ahem, perhaps you'd like to speak to our financial expert. ",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,60,10
11860,Mr. Krabs,103, Thanks for your business. ,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,27,4

11870,SpongeBob,104, I'm not trying to do anything. I'm just having a decent morning.,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,65,12
11871,Squidward,104, By running around and screaming like a banshee?,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,48,8
11872,Squidward,104, There are two kinds of people. There are people that are normal.  And then there's you. ,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,89,16
11873,SpongeBob,104, Really?,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,8,1
11874,Squidward,104," Yes, really! Maybe you should start being a little more NORMAL!  Doh...",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,72,12
11875,SpongeBob,104, I'm not normal?  Squidward?  How does one become normal?,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,57,9
11876,Squidward,104," Well, how about you start by...  GETTING AWAY FROM ME, YOU LITTLE CREATURE!",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,76,13
11877,SpongeBob,104," What's wrong with me? I need to understand normal!  ""How to be Normal"". Hm, this video should help.",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,100,18

11890,SpongeBob,104,"  Hi, how are ya.",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,17,4
11891,Squidward,104, What's the meaning of this?,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,28,5
11892,SpongeBob,104," I took your advice. From now on, I'm normal. ",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,46,9
11893,Squidward,104," Normal, huh?",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,13,2
11894,SpongeBob,104, Yup.,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,5,1
11895,Squidward,104," Oh, really?",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,12,2
11896,SpongeBob,104, Yup.,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,5,1
11897,Squidward,104, Whatever. I know you're just waiting to say something stupid.,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,62,10
11898,SpongeBob,104, Wonderful weather we're having.,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,32,4

11901,Squidward,104," Yeah, I'll uh...see you. ",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,26,4
11902,Mr. Krabs,104," SpongeBob, what are you doing sitting around? We need Krabby Patties out there.",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,80,13
11903,SpongeBob,104," Yes, sir. I'll do it... normally.",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,34,6
11904,Mr. Krabs,104," Eh?  Wow, that's all it takes these days, huh? Can you do more?  Oh, my! It's like printing money! ",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,100,19
11905,Squidward,104, I wonder what got into SpongeBob... And what the heck is that?!  Whose house is this?,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,86,16

11916,SpongeBob,104," You know it's a funny thing, Squidward. I smoothed out the edges of my personality and the rest just followed suit. Now I am utterly normal. ",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,142,26
11918,Mr. Krabs,104, Never?,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,7,1
11920,Mr. Krabs,104," Wait, where're you going?  SpongeBob! What are you doing back here? Do you expect the customers to eat this? And now, thanks to you, they're leaving in boat loads. ",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,165,29
11921,SpongeBob,104, Maybe this thing is out of ink.,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,32,7
11922,Mr. Krabs,104,"  No, boy, you're missing the point. You can't make Krabby Patties with ink and paper. You gotta put your heart in it, boy. Now get back to making them patties the right way and stop acting so dull.",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,198,38
11923,SpongeBob,104, What you call dull I call normal.,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,34,7
11924,Mr. Krabs,104," Well, till you decide to start making them patties the way only you can I want you out of my place!",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,100,21
11925,SpongeBob,104,"  I guess the decision to be normal was more life changing than I thought.  Hi, how are ya.",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,91,18
11926,Patrick,104, What happened to you?,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,22,4
11927,SpongeBob,104," Oh, I got normal.",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,18,4
11928,Patrick,104," Whatever that means. Hey, SpongeBob, what do you say we charge into Jellyfish Fields nets a-blaze? ",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,100,16
11929,SpongeBob,104," Let's do something normal, like window shopping.",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,49,7
11930,Patrick,104," Let's do this...  Ya-ha! Hey, your turn.",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,41,7
11931,SpongeBob,104," I think I'll pass. But I do need to defragment my hard drive, would you like to help?",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,86,18
11932,Patrick,104," Hey, listen...when you decide to do something fun you know where to find me. ",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,78,14
11933,SpongeBob,104," Ok, see ya 'round.  Hi, how are ya.",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,36,8
11934,Squidward,104," I never thought I'd hear myself say this but please come in, SpongeBob. ",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,73,13
11935,SpongeBob,104," Thank you. Tell me, what are you doing cooped up in here when the weather outside is so normal.",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,96,19

11937,SpongeBob,104," Wow, that's something you don't see in the average house.",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,58,10
11938,Squidward,104," You know, SpongeBob, it's OK to be a little different. ",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,56,10
11939,SpongeBob,104," And you know what else is abnormal? Your nose—it's all bulbous and flappy. Your eyes are a little odd, too. Looks like your whole face could use some work. Yeah, there we go.  See? Looking normal already.",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,207,37
11940,Squidward,104, What the...?,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,13,2
11941,SpongeBob,104," One more thing, Squidward. You don't wear pants. ",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,50,8
11942,Squidward,104, And stay out of my home! ,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,26,6
11943,SpongeBob,104," Oh, what happened? I lost my job and my best friend and now I'm too normal for Squidward. Maybe I have taken this normal thing too far. No problem, SpongeBob. You made yourself normal. Now all you have to do is reweird yourself. All it'll take is a mental adjustment and some tight clenching. Now focus...  and clench.  Oh, well, if I'm going to get weird, I'm going to need to see a professional. ",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,399,74
11944,Patrick,104,  Look at my tongue. ,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,21,4
11945,SpongeBob,104," That's very nice, Patrick, but I need you to retrain me. I want to be abnormal again.",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,86,17
11946,Patrick,104," Huh, I don't think you have what it takes.",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,43,9
11947,SpongeBob,104," Please, Patrick. If anyone can teach me the arcane art of the weird, it's you. Teach me how to be me, again.",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,109,22
11948,Patrick,104, It won't be easy but I'll do it.,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,33,8
11949,SpongeBob,104," Oh, thank you, Patrick!",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,24,4
11950,Patrick,104," But first, I'll need a garden hose and a flatbed truck and I'll need you to remove your trousers. ",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,99,19
11951,SpongeBob,104," Patrick, I'm feeling very self-conscious right now.",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,52,7
11952,Patrick,104,"  Try to concentrate on your first lesson in weird.  See you on the other side, buddy! ",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,87,16
11955,Patrick,104," SpongeBob, the weird therapy is working. Your craters are coming back. We just have to keep pushing the boundaries. We've gotta get stranger.  Talk backwards.",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,159,25
11956,SpongeBob,104, Tap erus uoy era? ,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,19,4
11957,Patrick,104, What's happening? The final transformation. ,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,45,5
11958,SpongeBob,104, Huh?,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,5,1
11959,Patrick,104, What happened?,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,15,2
11960,SpongeBob,104, I don't know. I guess I became permanently normal.,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,51,9
11961,Patrick,104, No!!,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,5,1
11962,SpongeBob,104,  I don't wanna be normal. .,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,28,6
11963,Patrick,104, Go away.,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,9,2
11964,SpongeBob,104, Normal is not worth it.,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,24,5
11965,Patrick,104, We're in mourning.,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,19,3
11966,Squidward,104,"  It's me, Squidward. I'm looking for SpongeBob.  Hi, how are ya? ",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,66,11
11967,Patrick,104," SpongeBob, you're back to your square shape.",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,45,7
11968,SpongeBob,104," Wow, I guess Squidward's normal looks scared me back to my original form. Thanks, buddy, you saved my life.",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,108,19
11969,Squidward,104," Wonderful weather we're having, hm?",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,36,5
11970,SpongeBob,104," It sure is, buddy. It sure is. ",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,32,7

Whoa!  I guess this is it.  Oh, you really saved me!  Whooooaaaa! Hey, a splinter. Okay, well, it's been nice knowing you but you have got to go. Now. Okay, out we go.  Oh, that kinda hurts. Come on.

And I couldn't hold the spatula with my hand so I used my nose.  Makes sense now, huh?",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,426,87

12335,SpongeBob,108," All right, no more jokes! Either you tell me where the secret ingredient is, or we'll be forced to use other means of making you talk! ",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,136,26
12336,Plankton,108," Sorry, I really have nothing for you.",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,38,7
12337,SpongeBob,108, Then how do you explain this? ,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,31,6
12338,Plankton,108," Okay, you caught me.",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,21,4
12339,SpongeBob,108, And so the truth floweth forth.,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,32,6
12340,Plankton,108," Yes, it is a Krabby Patty.",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,27,6
12342,Plankton,108," But, it's my version of a Krabby Patty.  After thousands of failed attempts to steal the recipe, I learned all but one ingredient needed to make Krabby Patties. The most important ingredient, the secret ingredient. Over the years, I've methodically gone through almost every letter of the alphabet. Right now I'm on the R's. And I've gotten up to raw sewage.",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,359,61
12343,SpongeBob,108,  Yuck.,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,7,1
12344,Plankton,108," Try it, tell me what you think. ",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,33,7
12345,SpongeBob,108," Well, he's clean. But if Plankton didn't steal the ingredient, who did?",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,72,12
12346,Patrick,108, Good question.,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,15,2
12347,SpongeBob,108," Only someone who specializes in science, could reverse engineer the recipe, based on the secret ingredient. Hmm, a scientist.  There she is.  You hang back. I'm going in for a closer look.  Oh, my gosh! It is Sandy!  Enjoying them Krabby Patties lady?",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,252,43
12348,Sandy,108, SpongeBob! How long have you been standing there buddy?,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,56,9
12349,SpongeBob,108," Oh long enough, ""buddy.""",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,25,4
12350,Sandy,108, I was just storing food for the impending winter. Want one?,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,60,11
12351,SpongeBob,108," I'm onto you, squirrel.  You thought no one could figure it out, but I pieced it together. I know exactly how you got all those patties.",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,137,26
12352,Sandy,108," What exactly are you getting at, SpongeBob?",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,44,7
12353,SpongeBob,108," What I am getting at, is that you...  ...cloaked yourself  an invisibility potion, snuck through the security perimeter... ",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,124,18
12356,SpongeBob,108," ...then used a time-freezing device to freeze time, used a laser beam to cut open the case, stole the Krabby Patty secret ingredient,  reverse engineered it, and made your own patties. So you wouldn't have to pay.",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,214,37
12357,Sandy,108," Or, perhaps I walked into the Krusty Krab, purchased them,  and received a receipt for these legally obtained patties!",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,119,19
12358,SpongeBob,108,"  283 Krabby Patties.  That's right, I cooked this order. I guess this means you didn't use a laser beam, or invisibility.",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,122,21
12359,Sandy,108," SpongeBob, next time before you run around accusing people of things, make sure your own house is in order first!",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,114,20
12360,SpongeBob,108," My own house, huh?  Why'd you do it, Gary?!",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,44,9
12362,SpongeBob,108," You've told us that story 100 times now, Gary. Unfortunately, my partner and I don't want to hear stories, we want to hear the truth! Look, we know you stole the secret ingredient and it's obvious how you did it!  First, you hitched a ride on a security chopper, then jumped into the drop zone. Then, when I stopped to pull up my sock, you snuck up behind me, and did what any snail could do. You shot corrosive acid from your tearducts, which melted the case, allowing you to steal the secret ingredient. ",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,507,94
12364,SpongeBob,108," Yeah, you're right, Gary, that is impossible. I never would have stopped to pull up my sock during a pickup.",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,109,20
12366,SpongeBob,108," What's that, Gary?",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,19,3
12368,SpongeBob,108," You did see someone leaving the Krusty Krab with a mysterious black case that night? Mr. Snail, could you please describe this, this marauder to the sketch artist.",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,164,28
12370,Patrick,108, I can't believe it! It was Squidward! ,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,39,7
12371,SpongeBob,108," Open up in there, Tentacles! We know you're in there! We just want to ask you a few...  Not cooperating.",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,105,20
12372,Patrick,108, You know what to do. ,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,22,5
12373,Squidward,108," And one, and... ",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,17,3
12374,SpongeBob,108, Gotcha! You thought you could hide your crimes.,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,48,8
12375,Patrick,108, But we hear-ed what you've done.,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,33,6
12376,Squidward,108," If I cared, I'd ask what this is about.",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,40,9
12377,SpongeBob,108," Well, I'm glad you asked, because this is about you stealing the Krabby Patty secret ingredient!  And we have an eye witness who saw you leaving the scene of the crime, with a mysterious black case.",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,199,36
12378,Squidward,108, A case like this? ,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,19,4
12379,SpongeBob,108, Yes! Because you can't make Krabby Patties without...  tap dancing shoes?,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,74,11
12380,Squidward,108, That's right! I was in a tap contest on the night in question. As you can see from my third place medallion.,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,109,22
12381,SpongeBob,108,  I guess this means you didn't steal the secret ingredient. ,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,61,10
12382,Squidward,108, GET OUT OF MY HOUSE! ,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,22,5
12383,SpongeBob,108," Mr. Krabs, I don't know how, sir, but somebody stole the Krabby Patty secret ingredient!",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,89,15
12384,Mr. Krabs,108," SpongeBob, you were in charge of guarding that secret ingredient with your life!",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,81,13
12385,SpongeBob,108," I know, Mr. Krabs. It just slipped away from me somehow.",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,57,11
12386,Mr. Krabs,108," Well, do you have any leads, or clues?",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,39,8
12387,SpongeBob,108," All I know is that it had to be someone who knew about the delivery, and was at the Krusty Krab during the delivery, and this person would have to know what to do with the secret ingredient when he got it.",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,206,42
12388,Mr. Krabs,108," That would be... you, SpongeBob! You stole me secret ingredient!",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,65,10
12389,SpongeBob,108, Me?!,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,5,1
12390,Mr. Krabs,108," That's right. And I know exactly how you carried out this little caper.  You obviously set up a decoy to take the delivery. Then when no one was looking, you swooped in, stole the secret ingredient, and spirited it away to the Chum Bucket,  where you sold it to Plankton to make a quick buck.  Don't talk! You can tell it to the cops, 'cause I'm calling them right now! ",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,371,70
12392,Mr. Krabs,108,"  Then arrest this thief, Officer! ",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,35,5
12393,SpongeBob,108," Mr. Krabs, isn't that the stolen secret ingredient?",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,52,8
12394,Mr. Krabs,108," Uh, what are you talking about, SpongeBob? I'm not holding any secret ingredient. ",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,83,13
12396,Mr. Krabs,108," Well, I wouldn't call it stealing...",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,37,6
12398,Mr. Krabs,108, I can explain!,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,15,3
12400,Mr. Krabs,108," It's simple, $1.99 is a lot to pay for the secret ingredient every time I get a delivery, so I s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s... took it to avoid paying, you know.",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,151,28
12402,Mr. Krabs,108, What? What'd I do? ,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,20,4
12404,Mr. Krabs,108, Your honor.,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,12,2
12406,Mr. Krabs,108," Give away me Patties for free? Oh no, I couldn't bear the sight of that. ",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,74,15
12407,SpongeBob,108," Step right up, and get your free Krabby Patties! ",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,50,9
12414,SpongeBob,109," 97, 98, 99, 100. Okay, Gary, let's do the other side now. Gary, can you hear that?  Oh Squidward, it's you. I thought I heard something.",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,137,26
12415,Squidward,109," SpongeBob, I've been sitting here motionless for 45 minutes. What could you possibly have heard me doing?",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,106,17
12416,SpongeBob,109, Breathing.,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,11,1
12417,Squidward,109," SpongeBob, I will give you $5 if you let me enjoy the rest of my morning, in peace.",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,84,18
12418,SpongeBob,109,  Okay! ,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,8,1
12419,Squidward,109," Hey, I could have sworn I had $5 in here.",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,42,10
12420,SpongeBob,109," I have it, Squidward, you gave it to me to leave you alone yesterday.  Squidward, you can have the $5 back. Mr. Krabs says--",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,125,24
12421,Squidward,109," I don't care, what Mr. Krabs said! I just want. ",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,49,10
12422,SpongeBob,109, Coffee rain!,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,13,2
12423,Squidward,109, It's hot choclolate. ,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,22,3
12424,SpongeBob,109," Chocolate rain!  Squidward!  Squidward, wait! ",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,47,5
12425,Squidward,109, It's locked!,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,13,2

12428,SpongeBob,109,  Squidward! Squidward!,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,23,2
12429,Squidward,109," Oh, why can't I just find?",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,27,6
12430,SpongeBob,109, Squidward?,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,11,1
12431,Squidward,109, What?!,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,7,1
12432,SpongeBob,109," You left your keys on the table back there.  Hey, Squidward?",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,61,11
12433,Squidward,109, Yes?,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,5,1
12434,SpongeBob,109, Didn't you used to have one of those cucumber bicycles?,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,56,10
12435,Squidward,109," Oh,  that was a recumbent bicycle, and I sold it.",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,50,10
12436,SpongeBob,109, Why?,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,5,1
12437,Squidward,109, So I could get further away from you! ,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,39,8
12438,SpongeBob,109," Okay, I'll see you later then, Squidward.",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,42,7
12439,Squidward,109," Bon voyage, nincompoop!  What the?  Can I help you, officer?",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,61,10
12441,Squidward,109,"  Ticket? Officer, please! I have inpeckable boat smarts! I pried my self in obtaining an un-soiled driving record! It's all that I have!",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,137,23

12446,SpongeBob,109," Psst, Squidward, sit here. Here.",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,33,5
12447,Squidward,109," Um, excuse me, there don't seem to be any empty seats left.",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,60,12
12449,Squidward,109, Do you mind?,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,13,3
12450,SpongeBob,109," Don't worry Squidward, we're boating buddies now! I'll teach you everything I know, and then we can.",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,101,17
12451,Squidward,109," We won't be doing anything, because there is no we! Understand?",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,64,11

12467,Squidward,109," Gladly.  It all started when I left my house. And then, he appeared. He made, an immediate right turn, and parked, here.  Seeing the oncoming hazard, I looked both ways, and proceeded safely toward my vehicle. It was then, that I realized that I was being followed, at an unsafe distance. So, in order to create more optimal driving conditions, I was then forced to par-take in  evasive action. And by increasing speed slightly, I created a safety cushion, while in-invertenttly attracting the attention, of said law enforcement official. May I sit down now, sweet cheeks?",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,573,96
12469,Squidward,109, His side?,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,10,2
12470,SpongeBob,109," Well, first, I started over here. And then I went way over here. Do-do-do-do, like that. Then, I went around like this, and over here like that, and across this lane, and down here like this, and then  and then I went around, and stopped right here. ",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,251,47
12472,SpongeBob,109, Do you like it Squidward?,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,26,5
12473,Squidward,109, Shut it. ,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,10,2
12474,SpongeBob,109," Ah, lunch time, eh boating buddy? ",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,35,6

12497,Squidward,109, I was just leaving. ,6,SpongeBob SquarePants,21,4

12500,Squidward,109," How many times do I have to tell you?! I am not your buddy! I don't need your help, and I don't need you, ever! Now just kindly let me take this stupid test, so I can get out of here, and never have to see you again, for the rest of my life!",6,SpongeBob SquarePants,242,54

16574,Mr. Krabs,137, Really? He's a mess! ,7,SpongeBob SquarePants,22,4
16575,SpongeBob,137," Mr. Krabs, I know you and Plankton are both sworn enemies and all, but putting on a dress to frighten him? Isn't that taking it a little too far?",7,SpongeBob SquarePants,146,29

16586,SpongeBob,137," But, certainly you wouldn't have use for such, innocuous information, would you?",7,SpongeBob SquarePants,81,12

16600,SpongeBob,137," Um, Plankton, if I were you I wouldn't be so smug.",7,SpongeBob SquarePants,51,11
16601,Plankton,137, Why?,7,SpongeBob SquarePants,5,1
16602,SpongeBob,137, Because a hungry pod of whales have just arrived for its early feeding. ,7,SpongeBob SquarePants,73,13
16603,Plankton,137,  Ahhhh! Not another feeding! Get me out of here! ,7,SpongeBob SquarePants,50,9

16808,SpongeBob,139," Okay, Grammyma, that's taken care of. I...  Grammyma! She must've made her own way up to the cash register all by herself! Maybe I'll catch up on my dishwashing while I have the chance.

16890,Patrick,140,"  Of course. He's a giant freak of nature, not a freak of nature that can't speak.  And so as the lowly snail sheddeth his shell, and the lofty gull moldeth his feathers, the brightest of friendships must dimmeth as the setting sun.",7,SpongeBob SquarePants,232,42

19605,SpongeBob,164," One time, my friend Patrick had this barnacle the size of an extra large Krabby Patty right at the center of his forehead! Anyway, I fixed it so we never saw that barnacle again.",8,SpongeBob SquarePants,179,34
19607,SpongeBob,164, I took him to see a hypnotist.,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,31,7
19609,SpongeBob,164, No. The barnacle. It became convinced it was a pelican and flew south for the winter. We never saw that pelican again.,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,119,22
19611,SpongeBob,164, What did I say?,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,16,4
19613,SpongeBob,164,  He was a really good hypnotist.,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,33,6
19614,SpongeBob,164, Now just remain calm and it's all over before you know it.,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,59,12
19616,SpongeBob,164,  Hypnosis? No! Hold still now. ,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,32,5
19618,SpongeBob,164,  I don't think this is going to work.  This ol' shovel is gonna do the work! ,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,78,16
19620,SpongeBob,164,  Gettin' there.,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,16,2

19633,SpongeBob,164,  More for me!,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,14,3
19634,SpongeBob,164,"  No, I think one jar of concealing cream is enough. Don't worry, Pearl, no one will notice a thing. ",8,SpongeBob SquarePants,101,19

19636,SpongeBob,164," Something wrong, Mr. Krabs?",8,SpongeBob SquarePants,28,4
19637,Mr. Krabs,164," For a second there, I thought a towering, hideous, mind-boggling abomination was standing here, staring at me in my own living room! But then I realized...  it's only my old, beloved daughter, Pearl.  Oh, Pearl. No, no, no need for these expensive trips to the spa. But don't worry, SpongeBob here will take care of it. I have more important measures to take care of.  Me jewwweells!",8,SpongeBob SquarePants,384,67
19638,SpongeBob,164," Pearl?  Pearl, you've been in the bathroom crying for three hours now. You can't stay in there forever.",8,SpongeBob SquarePants,104,18
19640,SpongeBob,164," Okay, I'm coming in!  Look at the bright side, Pearl. At least you can still play the piano.",8,SpongeBob SquarePants,93,18
19642,SpongeBob,164," I have no idea.  Don't worry, Pearl. I'll fix your crying!",8,SpongeBob SquarePants,59,11
19644,SpongeBob,164," Well, I'm sure if I'll think strong enough, something will pop up.  Oops, I didn't mean it like that.  Hey, it's that delicious-smelling soap again. ",8,SpongeBob SquarePants,150,25
19646,SpongeBob,164, Okay. Where do you keep your soap?,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,35,7
19648,SpongeBob,164,  Hello?  Something there? Pearl?!  Mr. Krabs!,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,46,6

19650,SpongeBob,164," Mr. Krabs, what is this thing?",8,SpongeBob SquarePants,31,6
19651,Mr. Krabs,164," Why, it's my old soap press!",8,SpongeBob SquarePants,29,6
19652,SpongeBob,164, Soap press?,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,12,2
19653,Mr. Krabs,164," That's right! All the soap Pearl and I use comes from this machine. And the best part is, it runs on 100% pure leftover Krabby Patties!",8,SpongeBob SquarePants,136,26
19654,SpongeBob,164, Leftover Krabby Patties?,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,25,3
19655,Mr. Krabs,164,"  Their precious essences are harvested, and after a brief cooling process, tumble out this conveyor belt as fresh, wonderful bars of soap!  Fresh and invigorating! Plus, it's absolutely free.",8,SpongeBob SquarePants,192,29
19656,SpongeBob,164,"  Ohhhh, that explains why it smells so familiar! I don't know about this, Mr. Krabs. If Pearl finds out that you...",8,SpongeBob SquarePants,116,21
19658,Mr. Krabs,164, Krabby Patty essence.,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,22,3

19662,Mr. Krabs,164,"  Got to go, keep your cellphone!",8,SpongeBob SquarePants,33,6
19664,SpongeBob,164," Don't worry, Pearl. I said I'm not going to let Mr. Krabs down, and I'm not going to. What do you think of that?",8,SpongeBob SquarePants,113,24
19666,SpongeBob,164," Wait a minute, Pearl, say that again!",8,SpongeBob SquarePants,38,7
19668,SpongeBob,164," Okay, you can stop. I think I have an idea...",8,SpongeBob SquarePants,46,10

19700,SpongeBob,165," Yeah. That's exactly right, Gare-bear. I can't go to work today.  The Krusty Krab is closed on Sundays.  Gee, Gary, I was really looking forward to work. Now what purpose could today possibly have?  Yeah, Mr. Krabs, did you me to come into work today? Oh. Hi, Sandy. Yeah... No... No, just me and Gary... No. I don't know yet... No, I'm not sick...

19706,SpongeBob,165," Well, this looks easy to remember. It's just a little black smudge.",8,SpongeBob SquarePants,68,12
19707,Sandy,165,  That's to save paper. You'll need this special reading scope. ,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,64,10
19708,SpongeBob,165, Oh.,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,4,1
19709,Sandy,165," Now pay attention as I clue you in on some of your more elaborate responsibilities. This majestic structure is my kelp greenhouse. Its functions are complete automated, so all you have to do...",8,SpongeBob SquarePants,194,33

19719,Sandy,165," This here is my worm incubator. They're not set to hatch for weeks, but I just thought I'd show it to you anyway.

19720,SpongeBob,165," Trust me, Sandy. You've got nothing to worry about. Your beloved treedome is in my capable hands.",8,SpongeBob SquarePants,98,17

19727,Patrick,165, SpongeBob! There you are!,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,26,4

19729,Patrick,165," Nah, no, thanks. I had a late breakfast.",8,SpongeBob SquarePants,41,8
19730,SpongeBob,165, Why are you wearing that funny thing on your head?,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,51,10

19738,SpongeBob,165," Well, Lucky Larry's sounds fun.",8,SpongeBob SquarePants,32,5
19739,Patrick,165," All right, let's go!",8,SpongeBob SquarePants,21,4
19740,SpongeBob,165," Hold it! I promised Sandy I'd take extra-special care of her treedome while she's at the Inventor's Convention today. And that is exactly what I intend to do. Patrick, this is a major responsibility.",8,SpongeBob SquarePants,200,34

19788,Sandy,165," That's right boys. I wanted you to destroy my home all along so I can test this out this here rubble reverse ray blaster on some genuine rubble.

19807,SpongeBob,166,  You know kah-ra-tay?,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,22,3

19813,SpongeBob,166, Okay? How do I do that?,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,24,6
19815,SpongeBob,166, Hm?,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,4,1
19817,SpongeBob,166, Um...sorry. I'm confused.,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,26,3
19819,Sandy,166, What Fuzzy is trying to say is that he is here to judge whether anyone is worthy of getting a karate belt or not.,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,114,24
19820,SpongeBob,166, But how can anyone ever truly know whether he or she is worthy?,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,64,13
19823,SpongeBob,166,"  Mm-mmm! Yeah, okay.",8,SpongeBob SquarePants,21,3
19825,SpongeBob,166, Okay! Prepare to see the split of your life! ,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,46,9

19845,Sandy,166, Huh?,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,5,1
19847,Sandy,166," Don't be disappointed, SpongeBob. A belt isn't the most important thing in karate.",8,SpongeBob SquarePants,83,13
19848,SpongeBob,166, Easy for you to say Sandy. Your pants aren't down right around your ankles.,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,76,14
19850,Sandy,166, Hey! You can't do that!,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,24,5

19855,Sandy,166, I know SpongeBob will impress you if you give him one more chance!,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,67,13
19857,Sandy,166, That's it! I'll take him to the Krusty Krab and then he might just find himself impressed by a certain sandwich maker!,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,119,22

20252,Mr. Krabs,171, Huh. He always has been a knucklehead.,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,39,7
20253,SpongeBob,171, Could this be one of Plankton's elaborate ruses?,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,49,8

20264,Mr. Krabs,171," Help me out here, buddy. ",8,SpongeBob SquarePants,26,5
20265,SpongeBob,171, Hey there. Dry those computer tears. I'm sure you two will get back  together. Plankton just need some time to realize how much he needs you. I mean you guys were made for each other. Well you were made more for him and more specifically by him and now he's built someone with more modern features who's better in every way.

20299,Mr. Krabs,171, Seriously? Did you just say money?,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,35,6
20300,Mr. Krabs,171," Welcome to the fight of the century! Where for only $5.99, and the purchase of two Krabby Patties, you will plead the answer to the age-old question. Which is superior? High-speed integrated circuits?",8,SpongeBob SquarePants,201,33
20302,Mr. Krabs,171, ...Or old-school vacuum tubes and diodes?,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,42,6
20305,Plankton,171, Wait! This isn't getting me any closer to the formula.,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,55,10
20308,Plankton,171,  Ow!,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,5,1

20345,Mr. Krabs,172," Haven't ye ever heard the saying ""If you don't stop making that face, it'll freeze that way""?",8,SpongeBob SquarePants,94,17

And the one he liked best was to stick his tongue out.  But what he really liked, was to stick his tongue at people. ",8,SpongeBob SquarePants,252,52

Every naughty deed is written in his scroll. So every Christmas morning, I get a stocking full of coal! ",8,SpongeBob SquarePants,261,50
20709,Plankton,175," I'm way ahead of you, Karen!  There is one element in the known universe that can turn even the nicest sap into the biggest jerk they can be! And I, Plankton have discovered it. Behold!  Jerktonium!  I'll give everyone in Bikini Bottom a present of the most innocent of all goodies. The fruitcake! Each and every slice will be laced with Jerktonium! Once ingested, no one can help becoming the biggest, creepiest, meanest jerk ever! Then Santa will realize that Sheldon J. Plankton isn't so bad after all! And then I'll get what I really want for Christmas, the Krabby Patty secret formula!  And now for the main ingredient, JERKTONIUM! Okay, Jerktonium, do your stuff! It's complete!  Ha ha! The Jerkmaker 9000 will make doling, outraging fruitcake a breeze! Now, who's gonna be my first victim?",8,SpongeBob SquarePants,800,136

20771,SpongeBob,175," What's that all about?  Hey, Patrick! What're you up to?",8,SpongeBob SquarePants,57,10
20772,Patrick,175," I think it's pretty obvious, SpongeBob!  I'm eating fruitcake and setting a tiger trap for Santa! Now, if you don't mind, I'm kind of busy right now.",8,SpongeBob SquarePants,150,27

20779,Squidward,175,  I'm not home!,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,15,3
20780,SpongeBob,175," Oh gosh, what do I do now?",8,SpongeBob SquarePants,27,7

20785,Sandy,175,  Why should I help all them jerks?,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,35,7
20786,SpongeBob,175," Because those jerks don't care about Christmas any more, Sandy! It's a problem.",8,SpongeBob SquarePants,80,13
20787,Sandy,175, Problem? My only problem is I'm out of fruitcake. Only thing I've got left to eat are boring old nuts. ,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,104,20
20788,SpongeBob,175," Oh, the problem isn't the fruitcake! The problem is that everyone, including you, is acting like a jerk! Oh, I'll have to solve this on my own.  Whoa!",8,SpongeBob SquarePants,151,28
20789,Sandy,175," Dagnabbit, SpongeBob, you got fruitcake in my Christmas magic analyser!  Well, I'll be hornswaggled. My analyzer's found something in the fruitcake!  This is terrible!",8,SpongeBob SquarePants,168,24
20790,SpongeBob,175," What is it, Sandy?",8,SpongeBob SquarePants,19,4
20791,Sandy,175," The fruitcake is contaminated with jerktonium! No wonder I've been as ornery as a sidewinder on a hot driveway. Jerktonium is the orneriest element of them all and your fruitcake is full of it. Where'd you get that fruitcake, anyway?",8,SpongeBob SquarePants,234,40
20792,SpongeBob,175," From Plankton, he baked it.",8,SpongeBob SquarePants,28,5
20793,Sandy,175, You took food from Plankton and fed it to everyone in town?,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,60,12
20794,SpongeBob,175, Uh-huh.,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,8,1
20795,Sandy,175, You're an idiot.,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,17,3

20798,SpongeBob,175, Oh! I've eaten tons of that fruitcake! I must be the biggest jerk in town!,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,75,15
20799,Sandy,175,"  Hmm … You don't act jerky. For some reason it's not affecting you.  It must be a combination of your tiny brain and pure heart. You're immune to Jerktonium, SpongeBob, but the rest of us will need an antidote. I'll set the analyzer to calculate the formula.  Why, this formula for the antidote don't make no sense at all!",8,SpongeBob SquarePants,325,59
20800,SpongeBob,175, Hmm… That's not a formula! That's a song!  Sandy! The song is the antidote!,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,79,13
20803,SpongeBob,175,"  Bring joy to the world, it's the thing to do, but the world does not revolve around you. Don't be a jerk. It's Christmas!  Be nice to babies and animals, old folks, too. 'Cause that's how you'd like them to treat you! Use turn signals. Don't screen my calls. Don't you wreck the house when you deck the halls. Spit your gum where it won't wind up on my shoe. Squeeze toothpaste from the bottom of the tube. Don't be a jerk. It's Christmas! It's Christmas!",8,SpongeBob SquarePants,458,85
20805,SpongeBob,175," Santa brought nearly every gift on your list. Why whine about the one that he missed? Don't be a jerk, it's Christmas! It's Christmas! Don't be a jerk. It's Christmas!",8,SpongeBob SquarePants,168,30

20809,SpongeBob,175," Oh, boy! Santa! You made it!",8,SpongeBob SquarePants,29,6
20811,SpongeBob,175," Oh, no!",8,SpongeBob SquarePants,8,2
20813,SpongeBob,175, Naughty list?,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,14,2
20815,SpongeBob,175, But---!,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,8,1
20819,Mr. Krabs,175, Me secret formula? How did you get that?,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,41,8

20825,Plankton,175, Uh-oh.,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,7,1
20827,SpongeBob,175," You want Santa, you gotta get through me!",8,SpongeBob SquarePants,42,8
20830,SpongeBob,175, Is that all you got?,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,21,5
20832,SpongeBob,175," You put that jolly elf down, you big tin imposter!  Hot from the oven, full of lovin'!  Hurry up, Santa, hop on!",8,SpongeBob SquarePants,114,22
20834,SpongeBob,175," Oh, it was nothing.",8,SpongeBob SquarePants,20,4
20836,Plankton,175, Uh-oh.,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,7,1
20837,Mr. Krabs,175," Hand it over, Sheldon. Don't make it any worse. ",8,SpongeBob SquarePants,50,8
20839,SpongeBob,175," Hey, has anyone seen Patrick?",8,SpongeBob SquarePants,30,5
20840,Patrick,175,   Gotcha! ,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,12,2
20853,SpongeBob,176,"  Going to work, going to work, I'm going to work! I'm going to work, I'm going to work  I'm going to work!  I'm going to work. I'm going to work, going to work, go-going to work. I'm crossing the street!  I'm crossing the street! Cross- whup!  I'd recognize that sound anywhere! It's the sound of horrible, croaking sobbing!

20854,Plankton,176," Oh, Neptune! Why, oh why?!",8,SpongeBob SquarePants,28,5
20855,SpongeBob,176, Plankton?,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,11,1
20856,Plankton,176," No, please!  I told you I'd get the money! Please, I-  Oh, it's you.",8,SpongeBob SquarePants,73,13
20857,SpongeBob,176," Plankton, what's got you so upset? I can hear you from three blocks away!",8,SpongeBob SquarePants,75,14
20858,Plankton,176," Oh, that. It's this doomsday device I invented.  It just doesn't do what it's supposed to do! ",8,SpongeBob SquarePants,99,16
20859,SpongeBob,176, Doomsday device? What's it supposed to do?,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,44,7
20860,Plankton,176," Well, it's supposed to upset the Earth's axis. Causing a chain reaction with typhoons, earthquakes, etc.",8,SpongeBob SquarePants,106,16
20861,SpongeBob,176," So, what does it do instead?",8,SpongeBob SquarePants,30,6
20862,Plankton,176, It just sparks and falls apart. ,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,35,6
20863,SpongeBob,176, Sparks and falls apart?,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,25,4
20864,Plankton,176, You don't believe me?,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,23,4
20865,SpongeBob,176,  N-no!  I believe you! I uh...  ...believe you.,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,53,7

20869,SpongeBob,176, Plankton wait!  Wait!  Wait!,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,34,2
20870,Plankton,176, I'm waiting!,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,14,2

20872,Plankton,176, Hmmm. Yes. Yes. Are you suggesting I form an evil alliance?,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,61,11
20873,SpongeBob,176," Um, something like that. ",8,SpongeBob SquarePants,28,4
20874,Plankton,176, That is an excellent idea! But where would someone like me find new friends? ,8,SpongeBob SquarePants,83,11

21836,Plankton,185," That's it, Karen! The goo bubble must be stuck at the bottom. We just have to get down there. Karen, cut the power to the entire ship.  Yes!  Look, there it is! Karen, fire up the engine power.  With my mechanical clam digger, I'll crack open this goo-cano easy as a clam! Which is what it was built for, so... You know, that makes sense.  Yes! Yes!

21847,Patrick,185," Oh, fine. Here. I don't need that old stick anyways. ",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,54,10
21848,Sandy,185,"  Come on, guys. We still have more tests to perform. I need a sample. Be a darling and hand me that there bucket.  Ok, SpongeBob, put a little bit of that gloop into this analyzer.  This is worse than I thought.",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,212,41

22195,Mr. Krabs,188," Say, kiddo, why don't see if you can't get old Kenny and his throng of fans to visit the old Krusty Krab for a while?",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,118,25
22196,SpongeBob,188," I shall do my Krustiest, sir. ",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,31,6
22197,Sandy,188,"  SpongeBob, don't you want your water helmet? ",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,47,7
22198,SpongeBob,188,"  Not necessary, Sandy. Like my personal hero, Kenny the Cat, I'm A-ok. ",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,72,12
22199,Sandy,188,"  Well, if you ain't going to use your helmet, I suggest you make it quick, SpongeBob.",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,87,15
22200,SpongeBob,188,"  Hey, Sandy, you're kinda like a cat, aren't you?",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,51,8
22201,Sandy,188,  Cat?!  In what way am I kind of like a cat?,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,46,10
22202,SpongeBob,188," Well, aren't cats and squirrels basically the same thing?",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,58,9
22203,Sandy,188," We are both mammals, but that is where the similarities end. Cats are no good scoundrels and I ain't never trusting one of them!",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,129,24
22204,SpongeBob,188," Well, you can trust Kenny the-. He's the heroic cat who has been holding his breath for days at a time.",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,104,21
22205,Sandy,188,"  I hate to precipitate on your party, SpongeBob, but that is impossible. No air breather could ever do that. Not even me! ",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,123,22
22206,SpongeBob,188," Very well, Sandra. If that is your stance, then so be it. Could ""someone"" be jealous of Kenny's dazzling lung capacity? ",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,121,21
22208,SpongeBob,188, Uh-huh.,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,8,1
22210,SpongeBob,188," Uh-huh, yeah. 14 hours is cutting it close but I had to work all day.",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,71,14
22212,SpongeBob,188," You know, I read in Kenny Fancy Magazine that he's so used to holding his breath that when he's topside, he forgets to breathe.",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,128,24
22213,Patrick,188," Wow!  Oh, that'd be like me forgetting to--  Oh! Oh, oh, oh... Oh, there you are, pocket taco. ",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,96,18
22214,SpongeBob,188,"  Patrick, have you ever gazed up into the starry night and see Kenny the Cat's face?",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,85,16
22215,Patrick,188, No.,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,4,1
22216,SpongeBob,188,"  Find the goober constellation and the dorsal constellation, then squint your eyes and let the details fall into place. ",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,121,19
22217,Patrick,188,"  Uh... Nope, I don't see it. Kenny's really gotten into your head lately.",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,75,12
22218,SpongeBob,188," Yeah, Kenny's awesome. Hey, that reminds me!  Let's paint our faces to look like Kenny!  Perfect!  We're the biggest Kenny the Cat fans ever!",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,142,24
22219,Patrick,188,"  This, uh, is getting creepy.",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,30,5
22220,SpongeBob,188,"  Hey, buddy. Check it out.",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,27,5
22221,Patrick,188,"  Sweet Neptune! Uh, SpongeBob, uh, I'm going to go now. Your obsession with Kenny is getting weird.",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,102,15
22222,SpongeBob,188, But you didn't even get to see my new Kenny the Cat temporary tattoo. ,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,71,14
22223,Patrick,188," Oh, that's okay. See you, SpongeBob! ",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,38,6
22225,SpongeBob,188,  Kenny!,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,8,1
22227,SpongeBob,188," Kenny, sir, it would mean a lot if you'd sign my official Kenny the Cat spatula.  Thanks, Kenny. You're so real.  Oh, you're hungry? What do you say we move this autograph session to the Krusty Krab?  Did you see that?! Kenny just gave me his trademark A-ok handsign!  Swoon! Swoon! ",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,286,50
22229,Mr. Krabs,188," One at a time, one at a time, please! Kenny the Cat will have time to meet each and every one of you's.  And I will have time to take each and every one of your dollars.  Look at myself. I'm not being a very good host.  Here you go! Condiments. On the house. Don't tell anybody. Welcome to the Krusty Krab family. ",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,316,63
22230,SpongeBob,188," Mr. the Cat? Everything OK?  Say, Mr. Krabs, this is gonna be a long day for Kenny. How about we give him a minute to freshen up?",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,132,26
22231,Mr. Krabs,188," What an excellent idea, SpongeBob! ""A clean cat is a moneymaking cat,"" I always say. Please  yourself of the lounge facilities. ",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,130,21
22232,SpongeBob,188," Well, I'd best get back manning the grill.",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,43,8
22234,SpongeBob,188,"  Sorry to bother you, Mr. the Cat, but I thought you'd just like a bite to…  Whoa!",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,85,17
22236,SpongeBob,188,"  How could you, Kenny?! You broke my heart! Here I was this entire time believing your act, only to discover that it was nothing but... an act!",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,146,25
22238,SpongeBob,188, There's no room for thoughts now. Only for tears. ,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,52,9
22240,SpongeBob,188," All right, Kenny, all right. I promise I won't tell anyone.",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,60,11
22242,SpongeBob,188," Yes, really. ",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,16,2
22244,Mr. Krabs,188," Ah, the cat of the hour is back!",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,33,8
22246,Mr. Krabs,188," All right, you ready to sign for these fine dollars—I mean, uh, suckers—I mean, uh, some autographs? ",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,108,16
22248,Mr. Krabs,188," Well, alrighty then. That's what the consuming public wants to hear.",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,69,11
22250,SpongeBob,188,"  ""You're welcome. I've been holding my breath for more than 20 years, no problem.""  ""You can too. Signed, Kenny the Breath-Holding Cat""?",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,139,22
22251,Sandy,188," Hiya, Kenny. Mind if I get your signature?  Gee, it sure is nice to meet another air-breathing, warm-blooded varmit down here.",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,127,21
22253,Sandy,188," Just out of scientific curiosity, how do you hold your breath for so long? ",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,77,13
22254,SpongeBob,188,"  Uh, we needn't burden ourselves with such needless scientific technicalities, Sandy.",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,88,11
22255,Sandy,188," I'm just wondering, SpongeBob. I mean, he does defy all scientific logic,  considering the fact that all air breathing mammals need oxygen to the brain and lungs to survive for more than 3 minutes. ",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,199,34
22256,SpongeBob,188," Hey, maybe we should show our fine guest a little more hospitality, hmm?",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,74,12
22257,Sandy,188,"  What has gotten into you, SpongeBob? Can't I talk about what must surely be happening from a biological standpoint? I mean, like the lack of oxygen will heighten the capillaries in the lungs, causing a dangerous level of carbon monoxide to rise in the bloodstream, which in turn leads to a ghostly blue color to the skin,  followed by eventual unconsciousness.",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,362,61
22261,Sandy,188, I knew Kenny was a fake! ,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,27,6
22264,Mr. Krabs,188," No! Come back!  Aw, thanks a lot, you air-breathing charlatan! And you can forget about these free condiments too! ",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,116,19
22265,SpongeBob,188," Gee, Kenny, I sure am sorry if I ruined your career.",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,53,11
22267,SpongeBob,188," Hey, I've got an idea. Most cats hate water, right? Well, you can be the cat that likes water. That way, you're still special.",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,127,24
22269,Sandy,188, Just get out of here already.  You can never trust a cat. Or is it a dog?,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,75,16
22276,SpongeBob,189, Ooh-wah!  Oh! ,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,15,2
22277,Squidward,189, Hmm? Who's that? ,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,18,3
22278,SpongeBob,189,"  Ah!  Hmm, something's missing.  Aha! June 15th.  Fine month for pickles.  Order up!  One perfect patty on a pristine plate in a squeaky-clean Krusty Krab. Man, oh, man, do I love my job!  Hey, Mr. Krabs. What's the good word?",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,227,40
22279,Mr. Krabs,189," Well, actually, SpongeBob, uh, there's two words. And they're not very good. You're fired.",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,91,14
22280,SpongeBob,189,"  Oh, Mr.-  what?",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,17,3
22281,Squidward,189, Fired?,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,7,1
22282,Mr. Krabs,189," Well, you see, I've been doin' some calculatin' and, you know, crunching the old numbers. And it turns out that I'll save a whole nickel if I cut your salary. Completely.",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,171,31
22283,SpongeBob,189,  But how about if I work for free?,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,35,8
22284,Mr. Krabs,189," Yeah, I looked into that. Apparently, it's  ""illegal"". And I'll lose my ""vendor's license"". Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,122,19
22286,SpongeBob,189, I don't know. Maybe.  Take it.,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,31,6
22287,Mr. Krabs,189,  You know I love you like a son. But you can't argue with a nickel.,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,68,15
22288,SpongeBob,189, But--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but.,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,90,1
22289,Squidward,189," Hey, what about me? Can I get fired too?",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,41,9
22290,Mr. Krabs,189," I'm afraid not, Squidward. You've got seniority.",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,49,7
22291,Squidward,189," Oh, yeah.",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,10,2
22292,Mr. Krabs,189," Nope, it's gotta be you, son. You're canned.  Here's your pink slip.  I'm giving you the ax.  You're fired.",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,108,19
22293,SpongeBob,189,  No! Not that! Anything but that! ,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,35,6
22294,Mr. Krabs,189," So, uh, if you could just hand over your spatula. Um... I'll just take that. ",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,78,15
22295,SpongeBob,189," Here, I'll get that for you. ",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,30,6
22296,Mr. Krabs,189, I'll also need the hat. Allow me.  Go ahead; take a moment to collect yourself. Long as you need. ,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,99,19
22298,Squidward,189,"  Okay, that's enough. It's closing time.  You know, it just won't be the same around here without you. You'll have to visit sometime...  As a customer.  Buh-bye now. Sayonara. Good riddance.  Man, is it gonna be sweet without that pest around!  This day couldn't get any better.  Well, Eugene, let me commend you on a terrific business decision. But now that SpongeBob's gone, who will be running the grill?",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,408,69
22299,Mr. Krabs,189," Squidward, I'll have you know,  I was five times ""golden spatula"" in the navy,  so I'll be runnin' the grill.  Ooh!",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,116,21
22300,Squidward,189, I can smell the grease fires already.,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,38,7
22301,SpongeBob,189,"  Hey, Gary, I'm home. ",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,23,4
22303,SpongeBob,189,"  Oh, Mr. Krabs feels he doesn't need me anymore.",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,49,9
22305,SpongeBob,189," What's that, Gary? You need me? Oh, the unconditional love of a pet.  Oh, I'm sorry. Here I am wallowing in my misery, and it's past your dinnertime.  I used to feed everyone in Bikini Bottom.  Now I just feed you.  Oh, thanks, Gary.",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,234,44
22307,SpongeBob,189,"  That's how I used to hold my spatula.  Patrick, what's wrong?",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,63,11
22308,Patrick,189,"  Oh, hey, SpongeBob. I heard you crying and it made me sad. ",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,61,12
22309,SpongeBob,189," Gee, I'm sorry. Why don't you come inside?",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,43,8
22310,Patrick,189,"  Hi, SpongeBob! Why are you making me so sad?",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,46,9
22311,SpongeBob,189," Patrick, the most horrible thing happened today. I got-- f-f-f-f-f-f-f...",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,74,10
22312,Patrick,189, Free French fries?,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,19,3
22313,SpongeBob,189, F-f-f-f-f-f-f...,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,17,1
22314,Patrick,189, Fried Frittatas?,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,17,2

22316,Patrick,189, Frothy frappe?,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,15,2
22317,SpongeBob,189, F-f-f-f...,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,11,1
22318,Patrick,189," I can't think of any more food that starts with the letter ""c"", SpongeBob.",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,75,14
22319,SpongeBob,189," It's not food, Patrick. I got fired.",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,37,7
22320,Patrick,189," Hey, that's great! Being unemployed is the best gig I know!  I tell you what. Meet me tomorrow morning, and I'll introduce you to the wonders of the unemployed lifestyle.",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,171,30
22321,SpongeBob,189," Sorry, Patrick, I can't. I have to wor-- oh. Yeah, okay.",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,57,11
22322,Patrick,189,  Great. See you then. ,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,23,4
22323,SpongeBob,189," Yeah, sure.  Whatever.",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,23,3
22324,Patrick,189," That's the spirit!  Now, the first stop on our tour of fun-employment is a healthy breakfast with our good friend Mr. Squidward.  Hey, Squidward! How are you this fine morning? ",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,178,30
22325,Squidward,189,  How many times do I have to tell you... Keep..  Off...  My... ... Petunias?!,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,78,14
22326,Patrick,189,  I'll just save this for later.  Now you try.,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,46,9
22327,SpongeBob,189,"  Uh...  Hey, Squidward. Look at me. I'm fun-employed! ",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,55,8
22328,Patrick,189," Hey, you're good at this. Next on our i-tin-er-ary, a brief mid-morning siesta. ",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,81,13
22330,SpongeBob,189, ,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,1,0
22331,Patrick,189,  Are you feelin' any better yet?,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,33,6
22332,SpongeBob,189,  Uh-uh.,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,8,1
22333,Patrick,189," Come on, SadPants. You know what always picks me up? ",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,54,10
22334,SpongeBob,189,  Nope.,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,7,1
22335,Patrick,189, Free lunch with friends!,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,25,4
22336,SpongeBob,189,  Yippee.,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,9,1
22337,Sandy,189," Okay, let's begin the experiment.  Mm-hmm.  Okay, next.",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,56,8
22338,Patrick,189," Oh, boy, lunch! ",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,17,3
22340,Sandy,189," Very interesting.  Okay, next.  SpongeBob! I almost didn't recognize you.  You look awful! What are you doin' with these here freeloaders?",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,139,21
22341,SpongeBob,189, I got fired. Now I'm fun-employed.  Whoo-hoo. ,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,47,7
22342,Sandy,189," Whoa, there. You do not want to eat that.",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,42,9
22343,SpongeBob,189, Why? What is it?,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,17,4
22344,Sandy,189, Heck if I know.  this here's a psychological test to see how much weird gunk folks will eat... if it's free.  Who's for seconds?,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,129,24
22346,Patrick,189,"  Here ya go, little buddy.  Ahh. Mmm!",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,38,7
22347,Sandy,189," SpongeBob, you're a mess. You're falling apart.  Come on now, SpongeBob. You need to pull yourself together. Get some structure in your life.  What you need is a new job.",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,171,30
22348,SpongeBob,189," You're right, Sandy.  I'm afraid I can't do this anymore, Patrick. Unemployment may be fun for you, but I need to get a job.",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,125,24
22350,Patrick,189, Hey! You can't talk to my friend like that! ,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,45,9
22352,Patrick,189," Don't listen to him, SpongeBob. You need to follow your heart.",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,63,11
22353,SpongeBob,189,"  Greetings, purveyor of elongated sausage products! I would love to work at your establishment.",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,96,14
22355,SpongeBob,189, Hmm.  This grill is not in very good shape.,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,44,9
22357,SpongeBob,189,"  Hmm. There's something not quite right about this food, but I'm not sure what it is.  Aha! ",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,93,17
22359,SpongeBob,189," Your weenies, sir. ",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,20,3
22361,SpongeBob,189, They're weenie patties.,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,24,3
22363,SpongeBob,189," Aah! But, Mr. Krabs, why?",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,26,5
22365,SpongeBob,189," I mean, Mr. Wiener!",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,20,4
22367,SpongeBob,189,"  Well that was a setback.  Hello, Pizza Piehole!",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,49,8
22369,SpongeBob,189,"  Excuse me, Mr. Pizza man.  You need a fry-cook? ",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,50,9
22371,SpongeBob,189,  Eh... probably. ,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,18,2
22373,SpongeBob,189," Cool.  Well, it's no Krabby Patty, but... Perhaps I'll find contentment.",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,73,11
22375,SpongeBob,189, Almost done! But I did change the recipe a bit.,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,48,10
22377,SpongeBob,189," Yeah, of deliciousness!",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,24,3
22379,SpongeBob,189, But who'll make the Krabby Patties?,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,36,6
22381,SpongeBob,189,"  Like I need his dumb job, anyway. I hope his pepperoni falls off.  Hey, taco man, may I have a job, por favour?",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,113,23
22383,SpongeBob,189,  How about that?,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,17,3
22387,SpongeBob,189,"  But I've given you the best years of my life, Mr. Krabs! ",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,59,12
22389,SpongeBob,189, ,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,1,0
22391,SpongeBob,189, Aah! ,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,6,1
22393,SpongeBob,189,"  Oh, I'll take it, all right. I'll take it to go! Home.",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,56,12
22394,SpongeBob,189,"  For years I worked at the Krusty Krab. Now I've been fired five times in one day.  Who are you gonna cook for now, SpongeBob?",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,127,25
22396,SpongeBob,189," Sorry, Gary, you must be starving.  Don't worry gare-bear.  I'll open up a can of Snailpo for you.  Oh, no.  We're all out of Snailpo.  We'll just have to make our own.  Perfect! ",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,180,33
22397,SpongeBob,189,  One homemade can of Snailpo! ,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,31,5
22399,SpongeBob,189,"  What's that, Gary? It's the best food you've ever had?",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,56,10
22401,Patrick,189,"  Yeah, this is dee-licious! Does it have any side effects?",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,59,10
22402,SpongeBob,189,  Only satisfaction.  If only my bosses liked my cooking as much as you two do.  I mean three.  Hello. Hmm. That's odd. I could've sworn I heard a knock at the door. ,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,166,32
22403,SpongeBob,189, Mr. Weenie?,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,12,2
22405,SpongeBob,189, But you just fired me.,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,23,5
22407,SpongeBob,189,  I'm pretty sure this is illegal. What am I gonna do now?,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,58,12
22409,SpongeBob,189," Pizza Pete! Yes, please. That wiener has me chained to the grill,  and he really seems to be relishing it.",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,107,20
22411,SpongeBob,189, Pizza sauce?  I'm free!,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,24,4
22413,SpongeBob,189, What?  Parmesan-crusted breadstick!  Whoa!,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,43,4
22416,SpongeBob,189,"  Oh, thank you, Señor Taco!  Oh, no! Not you too! ",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,52,10
22418,SpongeBob,189, Whoa!,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,6,1
22426,SpongeBob,189,"  Krabby Patty! You saved me!  Well, here we go again.",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,54,10
22430,Mr. Krabs,189,"  Wait! Come back!  That was me last customer.  SpongeBob?  Squidward, you found him!",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,85,13
22431,SpongeBob,189,  Squidward?,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,12,1
22432,Squidward,189,  I'm afraid so.  SpongeBob...,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,30,4

22435,SpongeBob,189," Yes.  Yes, I do.",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,17,4
22436,Squidward,189," Well, I hate the smell of burning Krabby Patties even more.  Please come back and be the fry cook again. ",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,106,20
22437,SpongeBob,189,"  Well, if it's okay with you, Mr. Krabs.",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,41,8
22438,Mr. Krabs,189," Oh, laddy.  I shoulda never let you go. The Krusty Krab has fallen apart without you. You're rehired, boy.",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,107,19
22439,SpongeBob,189,  All right! Now my life has purpose again!  Let's get this place cleaned up. ,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,78,14
22440,Squidward,189, Hmm.  Not exactly my color.,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,28,5

22499,SpongeBob,190, Not good. I think I took a wrong turn at the abandoned sofa. All there is around here are broken fire hydrants. What should I do?! ,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,133,26
22501,SpongeBob,190," I don't have a dime! Operator, please, please, can you tell me where I am?",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,75,15

22935,SpongeBob,194," I don't know. Let me check the rules.  Playing ""Certified Public Accountant"" isn't as much fun as I thought.  Maybe it'll be funner if we play louder!",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,151,27

22956,Patrick,194, I invented a game! I invented a game!,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,38,8
22957,Squidward,194, Whoopee. Do tell.,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,18,3
22958,Patrick,194," Well, you know how hard ""Tic-Tac-Toe"" is and how it always takes so long to play?",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,82,16

22972,Patrick,194," Sandy, I've been trying to invent a game, but every game I invent is a failure.",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,80,16
22973,Sandy,194,"  If you want to invent a game, you should study all the games you like and figure out what it is you liked best about them.  Then you can use those elements in the game you invent. ",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,182,37
22974,Patrick,194,  I know what to do!,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,20,5
22975,Patrick,194, And so it begins.,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,18,4

22978,Sandy,194," This time, he did research.",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,28,5
22979,Squidward,194," Well, if it's started, then I'm already bored.",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,47,8

22994,Squidward,194, Could we just get started already? I'm late for my coma. ,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,58,11
22995,Patrick,194," Alright!  I'll explain the rules. Each player picks a piece to move around the board. The way you decide which player gets to pick the piece by rolling the dice.  To decide who gets to roll the dice first to see who gets the first choice of players, you have to be...",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,268,52
22996,Squidward,194," Look, Patrick! You go, then Sandy, then SpongeBob, then me! Okay?",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,66,11

22999,Patrick,194," Ok! Now, onto rules of how to play the game.",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,45,10
23000,Squidward,194, I've got a great idea. Why don't we just start rolling and you can explain the game as we play.,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,96,20

23005,SpongeBob,194," Oh, what should I do? What should I do? What should I do?",9,SpongeBob SquarePants,58,13
23006,Squidward,194, Could you give me the dice? Give me the dice? Because it's my turn!,9,SpongeBob SquarePants,68,14
