50816,Rachel,12," No, I just mean that, you know, first impressions don't mean   anything. And I-I think you're a really good guy and I'm sorry that I misjudged   you.",9,Friends,150,27
50818,Rachel,12," Hello.  But you know what, hey, new day, new leaf,   I am just really really happy ...  I'm sorry,   obviously Heather's ass has something more important to say so I'll just wait   'till it's finished.",9,Friends,202,35
50820,Rachel,12, I was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her   out!,9,Friends,70,13
50822,Rachel,12," Oh wow, you are really, you're really a creep.",9,Friends,47,9
50824,Rachel,12," Oh yeah, I'm jealous. ""Oh Gavin, please, please look at   my ass"".  Stop looking at my ass! I mean, I just   think you are totally inappropriate, ok? This is a work environment, she's your   subordinate.",9,Friends,204,35
50826,Rachel,12," That is totally different for two reasons. One - I didn't know   that you knew that. And two, I wasn't some creep staring at his ass, we had   a deap meaningful relationship.",9,Friends,175,32
50828,Rachel,12," It was ...  oh my god. He didn't have a last   name. It was just ""Tag"". You know, like Cher, or, you know, Moses.",9,Friends,114,24
50830,Rachel,12," Oh, you know what - my first impression of you was absolutely   right. You are arrogant, you are pompous ... Morgan! Morgan! Tag's last name   was Morgan! Huh!",9,Friends,160,28
50832,Rachel,12," Yeah well what are you, his boyfriend?",9,Friends,39,7
50834,Joey,12," Man, I wish I had a nanny like you.",9,Friends,36,9
50836,Joey,12, Sure.,9,Friends,6,1
50837,Monica,12, Would you stop staring at her?,9,Friends,31,6
50838,Chandler,12, I wasn't staring. I was leering.,9,Friends,33,6
50839,Monica,12, What's the big deal with her? Maybe she's attractive in an obvious   kind of way.,9,Friends,82,15
50840,Ross,12," Yeah, obvious beauty's the worst. You know, when it's right there   in your face. Me, I like to have to work to find someone attractive. Makes me   feel like I earned it.",9,Friends,171,32
50841,Chandler,12, Looks like Joey is doing allright with her.,9,Friends,44,8
50842,Monica,12," Yeah. Hey, that was nice of you guys to back off and let Joey   get the girl for once.",9,Friends,87,19

50846,Monica,12, They've elected me to talk to you about the baby talk - it's   not so good.,9,Friends,76,16
50849,Rachel,12,"  Hey, listen, Joey, about Molly, I really prefer if   you didn't go after her.",9,Friends,79,14
50850,Joey,12, Why not?,9,Friends,9,2
50851,Rachel,12," Because it took us months to find a good nanny and I wouldn't   want anything to, you know, drive her away.",9,Friends,108,21
50852,Joey,12," So, what, you think I'm just gonna sleep with her and never call   her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable?  Yeah, sounds   about right.",9,Friends,146,25
50853,Ross,12," Come on, there are plenty of other women out thereok? Just - just   forget about her, ok? Just, she's off limits.",9,Friends,114,21
50854,Joey,12," Oh, man, why did have to go and say that for? Now that you told   me I can't have it makes me want her even more!",9,Friends,114,26
50855,Ross,12," What are you, a child?",9,Friends,23,5
50856,Joey,12, Yes!,9,Friends,5,1

50879,Ross,12," Listen, can you do me a favor? I'm gonna be out today. Can you   just keep an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?",9,Friends,140,28
50880,Chandler,12, You don't trust him?,9,Friends,21,4
50881,Ross,12," Wh - No. Some woman who sounded a lot like Joey called earlier   and asked for her daughter, the ""hot nanny"".",9,Friends,110,21
50882,Chandler,12," Is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference?   Because I could get a job any day now.",9,Friends,105,21
50883,Ross,12," You do appear right on the cusp of something. Come on man, I'm   sure he'll lose interest in a week or two, but for now can you please just do   this for me?",9,Friends,158,33
50884,Chandler,12," Allright, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work. Because   you know as well as I do that once Joey sets his mind on something, more often   than not, he's going to have sex with it.",9,Friends,188,37
50885,Ross,12," Well we gotta do something, ok? Nannies like her don't grow on   trees.  ",9,Friends,74,13
50886,Chandler,12, Picturing that tree?,9,Friends,21,3
50887,Ross,12," I am, yes.",9,Friends,11,3
50889,Chandler,12," Where you going, Joe?",9,Friends,22,4
50890,Joey,12, For a walk.,9,Friends,12,3
50891,Chandler,12, Oh. You mind if I join you?,9,Friends,28,7
50892,Joey,12," Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize   my thoughts.",9,Friends,80,14
50893,Chandler,12, Your thoughts? Plural?,9,Friends,23,3
50894,Joey,12," Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny,   I gotta see her!",9,Friends,86,16
50895,Chandler,12," I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.",9,Friends,41,9
50896,Joey,12," Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her?? You guys are killing me!   She's forbidden fruit! It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable   boy ... Why are you doing this, huh? Did Ross tell you not to let me go over   there?",9,Friends,235,46
50897,Chandler,12," Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go.",9,Friends,56,14
50898,Joey,12, Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against   the world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.,9,Friends,133,24
50899,Chandler,12, Great novels? ,9,Friends,15,2
50900,Joey,12, Fine ... mediocre porn,9,Friends,23,4

50905,Rachel,12," Um, excuse me Gavin, I have a question I need to ask you.",9,Friends,58,13
50907,Rachel,12, If you like looking at butts so much why don't you just go look   at a mirror?,9,Friends,79,17
50909,Rachel,12," Oh, please, I don't care about you enough to bug me. In fact,   from now on, I'm going take the high road. And I'm going be very very nice to   you, you ""momma's boy"", starting right now.",9,Friends,188,37

50929,Rachel,12, What?,9,Friends,6,1
50930,Monica,12, Maybe he's bothering you so much because he likes you. It's   like in first grade when Skippy Langwild always pushed me on the playground   because he secretly had a crush on me?,9,Friends,179,32

51098,Rachel,14," Well, I'll probably be back to pick   her up around six, but she's in the bedroom all ready to go. But she did actually   fall back to sleep, so...",9,Friends,148,29
51099,Joey,14, She's probably exhausted from all   that adorable screaming she did last night.,9,Friends,80,12
51100,Rachel,14, Bye!,9,Friends,5,1
51101,Ross,14," Bye! Hey, I hope Emma isn't making   it too hard on you.",9,Friends,57,12

51104,Joey,14," Yeah. And look, I just want you to   know that with Rachel staying here and everything, all my feelings from before   are totally over, okay? And even if they weren't, when you accidentally walk   in on a woman using a breast pump...",9,Friends,234,42
51105,Ross,14," Yeah, that'll do it.",9,Friends,21,4

51108,Joey,14, Really?,9,Friends,8,1
51109,Ross,14," Sure, I mean, do I wish me and Rachel   living together would have worked out? Of course. You know, I'm disappointed,   but it's not like it's a divorce.",9,Friends,154,28
51110,Joey,14," Well, actually it...",9,Friends,21,3
51111,Ross,14," No, it's not a divorce, it is not   a divorce! Anyway, I think Rachel and I need to, you know, get on with our lives,   maybe, maybe start seeing other people.",9,Friends,160,31
51112,Joey,14," Wow, really?",9,Friends,13,2
51113,Ross,14," Yeah, sure, why not? In fact, if you   know anyone that would be good for me...",9,Friends,80,16
51114,Joey,14," Sure, I know lots of girls. ",9,Friends,29,6
51115,Ross,14, Yeah? Any names come to mind?,9,Friends,30,6
51116,Joey,14," Ooh, names?",9,Friends,12,2
51119,Joey,14, Hey. I was just gonna get something   to eat. You want something?,9,Friends,66,12
51123,Joey,14," I'm fine, I'm fine, it's just, it's   just weird what's happening with her and Ross. You know, yesterday he asked   me to fix him up with somebody.",9,Friends,148,27
51125,Joey,14, Why are they doing this?,9,Friends,25,5
51127,Joey,14," You know what's crazy? These jars.   What is it, like two bites in here?",9,Friends,73,14
51129,Joey,14," I know, I know. And when they moved   back in together, I figured y'know, that's where things were headed.",9,Friends,107,19
51131,Joey,14," Yes, and they should name one of their   kids Joey. I may not have kids; someone's gotta carry on the family name.",9,Friends,115,22
51134,Joey,14, I know; that just pushes them further   and further apart. ,9,Friends,60,10
51136,Joey,14," Ooh, that's a great plan! ",9,Friends,27,5
51138,Joey,14," Shhh! Not so loud, we don't wanna   wake up, uh...",9,Friends,51,10

51142,Rachel,14," You guys aren't doing anything tonight,   are you?",9,Friends,51,8
51143,Chandler,14," See, now, why would you assume that?   Just because we're married? I will have you know that we are very hip, happening   people. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to reading the obituaries.",9,Friends,202,37
51144,Rachel,14, I was just asking 'cause I need someone   to watch Emma tonight.,9,Friends,65,12
51145,Monica,14," Sure, we'll do that. What are you   up to?",9,Friends,43,9
51146,Rachel,14," Well, Phoebe set me up on a date.   ",9,Friends,37,8

51150,Monica,14," Just figured, 'cause you and Ross   are...",9,Friends,43,7
51151,Rachel,14," What, slept together a year and a   half ago? Yeah, I'm all set.",9,Friends,65,13
51152,Chandler,14," Well, I think it's great that you're   going on a date, you know? I mean, it sounds healthy. I mean, you have needs.   Embrace your womanhood!",9,Friends,143,26
51153,Monica,14," You want a job? Turn off ""Oprah,""   and send out a resume!",9,Friends,59,12
51154,Rachel,14, So I'll bring her by around seven?   Is that okay?,9,Friends,51,10
51155,Monica,14," Oh, it's perfect.",9,Friends,18,3
51156,Rachel,14," Oh, you guys are gonna have so much   fun! She's at such a cute age. Oh, a couple things. Now that she's eating solid   food, she poops around the clock. And watch out for your hair, 'cause she likes   to grab it. And oh, she's also in this phase where if you leave the room, she   screams bloody murder, but ah... Thanks, you guys. Have fun!",9,Friends,343,66
51160,Joey,14, Hey.,9,Friends,5,1
51162,Joey,14, All right! Who is he?,9,Friends,22,5

51172,Joey,14, She even reads for pleasure!,9,Friends,29,5
51174,Joey,14, What? I'm not allowed to know smart   women? ,9,Friends,46,8
51176,Joey,14, I met her at the library. I went in   to pee.,9,Friends,46,11
51178,Joey,14," Well, okay, I'll - I'll just call   her and tell her the date's cancelled, and find him somebody else.",9,Friends,103,19
51180,Joey,14, Ooh...I hear that's bad. ,9,Friends,26,4

51187,Chandler,14," Emma? Emma? Look at me! Well, I think   I'll go downstairs for a while.",9,Friends,72,14
51188,Chandler,14," No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! It's   okay, it's okay. I didn't go. Don't cry, it's just a bit! I'm your uncle Chandler;   funny is all I have!",9,Friends,145,30

51190,Chandler,14, I don't do that.,9,Friends,17,4

51193,Chandler,14, Today is the sixth.,9,Friends,20,4
51194,Monica,14," No, it's not.",9,Friends,14,3
51195,Chandler,14," Yes, it's also 2003.",9,Friends,21,4
51196,Monica,14, Oh my god. Today's the sixth?! I may   be done ovulating! I may have also served some very questionable meat at the   restaurant.,9,Friends,130,23
51197,Chandler,14, It's okay. Go take the test and see   if we're okay.,9,Friends,53,11
51198,Monica,14, Okay.,9,Friends,6,1
51199,Chandler,14, Tough crib.,9,Friends,12,2
51200,Monica,14," Hey, where are all my ovulation-sticks?   There's only one here.",9,Friends,65,10
51201,Chandler,14, I might have checked to see if I was   ovulating a couple times.,9,Friends,65,13
51202,Monica,14, Chandler!,9,Friends,10,1
51203,Chandler,14, I am not working. There's not much   to do around here!,9,Friends,56,11
51205,Ross,14," Excuse me, is there a woman waiting   at the bar? Someone average height, dark hair, perhaps doing a puzzle?",9,Friends,109,19
51207,Ross,14," Well, if I'm still here in an hour,   buy him a drink on me.",9,Friends,61,14
51209,Ross,14," Nah, I don't know if I should. I don't   wanna be drunk when I go home alone.",9,Friends,78,17
51211,Ross,14," Yeah, it's no big deal. It's just   a blind date.",9,Friends,50,10
51213,Ross,14, No! ,9,Friends,5,1
51215,Monica,14, We're okay. I'm still ovulating.,9,Friends,33,5

51217,Monica,14," So, let's do this.",9,Friends,19,4

51220,Chandler,14, Because of Emma.,9,Friends,17,3

51222,Chandler,14, Sorry.,9,Friends,7,1
51223,Monica,14," Unless... Maybe we do it here. I mean,   how much can she even be aware of at this age?",9,Friends,88,19
51224,Chandler,14," Well, she's aware when we leave the   room. She may notice if we start... canoodling in it.",9,Friends,92,17
51225,Monica,14, Canoodling?,9,Friends,12,1
51226,Chandler,14," Well, I can't say ""hump""   or ""screw"" in front of the B-A-B-Y.",9,Friends,63,12
51227,Monica,14," I don't know. I mean, I guess having   sex in front of a baby isn't so...",9,Friends,74,16
51228,Chandler,14, Horrifying? Scarring? Something people   go to jail for?,9,Friends,57,8
51229,Monica,14, I guess you're right.,9,Friends,22,4
51230,Chandler,14," You guess I'm right? When we stayed   at that bed and breakfast, you wouldn't have sex with me because you thought   a deer was staring through the window.",9,Friends,156,28
51231,Monica,14, But what kind of a sick bastard wants   to do it in front of a deer?,9,Friends,69,16
51233,Rachel,14," Wow, everything looks so good! I think   I'm gonna have the chicken.",9,Friends,69,12

51237,Rachel,14, What?,9,Friends,6,1

51244,Rachel,14, Really? What's that like?,9,Friends,26,4
51248,Rachel,14, Really? ,9,Friends,9,1
51251,Rachel,14," Phoebe, it's me. I'm going to hunt   you down and kill you!",9,Friends,60,12
51253,Rachel,14, This is the worst date ever. How could   you set me up with this creep?,9,Friends,72,15
51255,Rachel,14, I don't care! This guy is a nightmare!,9,Friends,39,8
51257,Rachel,14, He's not stoned.,9,Friends,17,3
51259,Rachel,14," Yeah, four times.",9,Friends,18,3
51262,Joey,14," Oh, great, pretty soon they'll be   back together.",9,Friends,51,8
51265,Monica,14, She's asleep. Chandler?,9,Friends,24,3

51270,Monica,14," Yes, but we have to be fast.",9,Friends,29,7
51273,Joey,14, Hello?,9,Friends,7,1
51274,Joey,14, Emma? Hey! Hi!,9,Friends,15,3
51275,Joey,14," How are ya? How are ya? Where are   your babysitters, huh? Why's the bedroom door closed?",9,Friends,90,16
51276,Joey,14," You can't have S-E-X, when you're   taking care of the B-A-B-I-E!",9,Friends,66,11
51279,Ross,14," Eh, if it was meant to be, it's meant   to be.",9,Friends,47,11
51281,Ross,14," Wow, free crab cakes. Well, that's   nice. Although I was hoping to have sex tonight.",9,Friends,86,15
51283,Ross,14, Just the crab cakes.,9,Friends,21,4
51286,Ross,14, What's - what's going on?,9,Friends,26,5
51288,Ross,14, What? You - you're making money off   my misery?,9,Friends,49,9
51289,Ross,14," This is unbelievable. I - I have never   been so insulted in my life. Now, if you'll wrap up my free crab cakes, I'll   be on my way.",9,Friends,134,28
51291,Monica,14," Well, that was weird. You were loud,   and I was fast.",9,Friends,55,11
51292,Chandler,14, I think we may have really done it   this time.,9,Friends,48,10
51293,Monica,14," Oh, I wish I didn't have to wait to   take a pregnancy test.",9,Friends,61,13
51294,Chandler,14, You may wanna get some more of those   too.,9,Friends,44,9
51295,Chandler,14, Where's Emma?,9,Friends,14,2
51296,Monica,14," Oh my god, where's Emma? Where's Emma?",9,Friends,39,7
51297,Chandler,14," Don't ask me, I was in there canoodling   you!",9,Friends,47,9
51298,Monica,14," Okay, okay, I'm sure that Rachel came   home early and picked up Emma. You go look across the hall, and I'll call her   cell.",9,Friends,126,24
51299,Chandler,14, Okay. ,9,Friends,7,1
51300,Monica,14," Hey, you better hope that we're pregnant,   because one way or another, we're giving a baby back to Rachel.",9,Friends,108,19
51303,Rachel,14," No, no, no, I admire a man who can   cry.",9,Friends,42,10
51305,Rachel,14, Don't touch my coat!,9,Friends,21,4

51314,Rachel,14," What? What do you mean, ""there   you are""? Where was she?",9,Friends,58,11
51315,Monica,14," Oh, we were playing ""peek-a-boo.""   She just  she loves it when I'm dramatic.",9,Friends,79,14
51317,Joey,14, Because you two were having sex!,9,Friends,33,6
51318,Monica,14," No, we weren't!",9,Friends,16,3
51319,Joey,14, Don't you lie to me! I could tell   by Chandler's hair.  You are so lazy. Can't you get on top for   once?,9,Friends,107,22
51320,Chandler,14," All right, all right, we were. We   were trying to make a baby. Monica's ovulating.",9,Friends,84,15
51321,Joey,14, Hey! It is unacceptable that you two   would have sex with Emma in the next room. I'm gonna have to tell Rachel about   this. ,9,Friends,127,24
51322,Chandler,14," No, no, no.",9,Friends,12,3
51323,Monica,14," No, please don't. Please, Joey. She   will kill us!",9,Friends,52,9

51327,Chandler,14, What? Why?,9,Friends,11,2
51328,Joey,14," Hey, I may never have kids, and somebody's   gotta carry on my family name.",9,Friends,76,14
51329,Chandler,14, Your family name is Tribbiani.,9,Friends,31,5
51330,Joey,14,   You almost had me.,9,Friends,21,4
51332,Rachel,14," Well, uh...",9,Friends,12,2

51337,Ross,14," Hey, what's wrong?",9,Friends,19,3
51338,Rachel,14, I just had a rough night.,9,Friends,26,6
51339,Ross,14, Oh. Crab cake?,9,Friends,15,3
51340,Rachel,14, Eww!,9,Friends,5,1
51341,Ross,14," Well, what happened?",9,Friends,21,3
51342,Rachel,14," Oh, well, I...It's kind of weird talking   to you about this, but...",9,Friends,69,12
51343,Ross,14, Monica told me you had a blind date.,9,Friends,37,8
51344,Rachel,14, Yeah.,9,Friends,6,1
51345,Ross,14," I did, too.",9,Friends,12,3
51346,Rachel,14, Oh.,9,Friends,4,1
51347,Ross,14, But is it technically a date if the   other person doesn't show up?,9,Friends,68,13
51348,Rachel,14," Oh, oh no. Do you think she walked   in, saw you and left?",9,Friends,59,13
51349,Ross,14, Why does everyone keep saying that?,9,Friends,36,6
51350,Rachel,14," Well, if it makes you feel any better,   I wish my date hadn't shown up.",9,Friends,73,15
51351,Ross,14, That bad?,9,Friends,10,2
51352,Rachel,14," Well, he makes t-shirts for a living,   and he thought it would be appropriate to give me this.",9,Friends,96,18
51353,Ross,14, Female body inspector? What size is   that?,9,Friends,44,7
51355,Joey,14, Uh-huh.,9,Friends,8,1
51357,Joey,14," It's easy, you just walk in on them   having sex.",9,Friends,50,10
51361,Ross,14," The first date we've had in months,   and they were both such disasters.",9,Friends,73,13
51362,Rachel,14," Oh. Huh. You know, it is weird that Phoebe would set me   up on a date that was awful on the same night that Joey set you up on a date   that didn't even show.",9,Friends,160,35
51363,Ross,14," Wait a minute; you don't think it   was intentional? I mean, that's just stupid.",9,Friends,81,14
51364,Joey,14," We're geniuses! Yeah, look at them,   look at them, they're really bonding.",9,Friends,76,12
51367,Joey,14, Where?,9,Friends,7,1
51370,Joey,14, Can you believe they're still not   here?,9,Friends,42,7
51371,Ross,14," I know. A double blind date, and we   both get stood up. What are the chances?",9,Friends,79,16
51372,Joey,14," I know, I'm so bummed. Can we have   our free crab cakes now?",9,Friends,62,13
51374,Joey,14, We've been stood up.  And   we want our free crab cakes.,9,Friends,57,11
51379,Chandler,16, Did you see our bank statement? Can this be right?,9,Friends,51,10
51380,Monica,16, I know...God. I haven't seen my savings take a hit like this   since I was a kid and they came up with double-stuffed Oreos. What happened   to all our money?,9,Friends,159,30
51381,Chandler,16," I'm not sure what they did, but I'm inclined to blame Enron.",9,Friends,61,12
51382,Monica,16," I guess with you doing the internship, we're just spending more   than we're bringing in.",9,Friends,90,15
51383,Chandler,16, Maybe I should quit and get a job that pays.,9,Friends,45,10
51384,Monica,16," Oh, But you're finally doing something that you love! I can't   ask you to give that up. Though it'd be nice if the thing that you love was   y'know... finding gold.",9,Friends,166,31
51385,Chandler,16, You know what? You know what? I think we're making too big   a deal out of this. ok? So we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe   next month we cut back on a few things. And maybe we start eating out of Joey's   refrigerator for a change. You're chef... what can you make out of backing soda   and beer?,9,Friends,316,63
51386,Monica,16, Ok worse case scenario is...we borrow some money from my parents.,9,Friends,66,11
51387,Chandler,16, No! We're not borrowing money.,9,Friends,31,5
51388,Monica,16, Why not?,9,Friends,9,2
51389,Chandler,16, Because we don't do that. We are Bings! And if there's one   thing my father taught me was... well to always knock before going into the   pool house... but the other thing was never borrow money.,9,Friends,197,36
51390,Monica,16, Wow! I Had no idea you had this much pride.,9,Friends,44,10
51391,Chandler,16, That's right! I do! And I'm your man. And I'm going to get   us through this situation even if it means you working twice as hard.,9,Friends,131,26
51412,Monica,16, Hey Joey!,9,Friends,10,2
51413,Joey,16, Hey!,9,Friends,5,1

52900,Joey,21,"  Oh, that's what she meant!  You know, if they're   gonna shorten it, they should call it the MUSE! You know, short for museum,   and avoid all the confusion!",9,Friends,159,28
52901,Ross,21," Yeah, most of it it's a place  packed with confused angry   baseball fans!",9,Friends,75,13

52910,Joey,21," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! So, I walk in the door and make   the right ",9,Friends,75,15
52912,Chandler,21, I have a weird feeling about this place.  How do I   know that they are not gonna secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet.,9,Friends,138,27
52913,Monica,21," Because, honey, I mean this in the sweetest way possible, nobody   is gonna wanna watch that.",9,Friends,94,16

52946,Rachel,21, Damn! I wish I knew if that was right!,9,Friends,39,9
52948,Joey,21,  Note the painterly lines   and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors   as his elusive subject was light itself.,9,Friends,149,23
52949,Ross,21," Now, do you have any idea what you just said?",9,Friends,46,10
52950,Ross,21," Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt   M-O-N-A-Y. I just... I wrote that out phonetically for you.",9,Friends,127,23
52951,Joey,21, Phonetically? ,9,Friends,15,1

52956,Ross,21, Wow. What does that mean?,9,Friends,26,5
52957,Joey,21," No idea! But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I   guess it means ""you're gonna get eaten by a bear"".",9,Friends,115,26
52958,Ross,21, Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance?,9,Friends,41,8
52959,Joey,21," Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish   of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! .",9,Friends,118,19

52970,Chandler,21,"  Yeah, but what if it's not? What if there   is a reason why we can't have a baby?",9,Friends,83,18
52972,Chandler,21,"  oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. I can't believe   I didn't even think of that. I guess I was just so worried about having to...   come here and do... 'that'...",9,Friends,155,29
52974,Chandler,21,"  It was a ""Wendy's!!   """,9,Friends,25,5
52977,Rachel,21," Wow, Ikea... what a rich culture. Uhm, you know what? I have   a friend who is a masseuse.",9,Friends,91,18
52979,Rachel,21, Yah! She's... uhm... not very good though... ,9,Friends,46,7
52981,Rachel,21, I don't know... maybe it's because she has got such callousy   fingers from playing crummy guitar...,9,Friends,101,16
52983,Rachel,21,  Phoebe!!,9,Friends,10,1
52985,Rachel,21," For like a half an hour! Man, you can lie about Sweden!",9,Friends,56,12
52987,Rachel,21, How could you not tell me you worked here?,9,Friends,43,9
52989,Rachel,21," Yes you do, if you're going to make me feel guilty for getting   a free massage!",9,Friends,81,16
52991,Rachel,21," Oh! Phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here?",9,Friends,54,11
52993,Rachel,21," Phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much, you should walk out there   right now and quit! Be true to what you believe in! Honey, you have principles   and I so admire that! I don't have any!",9,Friends,188,37

53004,Ross,21," Yeah? Joey really knows his art, huh?",9,Friends,38,7
53006,Ross,21, What do you mean?,9,Friends,18,4
53008,Ross,21,"  Wait a minute... when you guys walked   into the Met, did you go to the right?",9,Friends,80,16
53010,Ross,21,"  Oh Joey, Joey! But still, I mean, it seems like   you guys are having a great time together.",9,Friends,94,18
53012,Ross,21, What?,9,Friends,6,1
53014,Ross,21," What, I mean, a little, but no, what, go on.",9,Friends,45,10
53016,Ross,21,"  Yeah. But you know what? I think you should give Joey   a chance. I mean, he's a great guy, and sure he doesn't know that much about   art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else.",9,Friends,204,40
53018,Ross,21," And if you think about it, I mean the reason he memorized all   that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. You know, that's the   kind of guy Joey is.",9,Friends,166,33
53020,Ross,21, That was going to be my next argument.,9,Friends,39,8
53021,Joey,21, Hey!,9,Friends,5,1

53030,Chandler,21,  It is not okay that I'm aroused by this now.,9,Friends,46,10
53031,Chandler,21," Hello? Oh hi, Doctor Connelly.  No, she's not here   but, you know, I can tell her. Should I be sitting down for this?  Oh.  Well, so what does that mean?    Ok. Ok, thank you. Thanks. ",9,Friends,186,35

53034,Monica,21," With good news?  Of course   it is not good news, you just said  ""Doctor Connelly just called"".   If it was good news you would have said  ""Doctor Connelly just   called! "" But so what is it? Is there a problem, uh? Is there a problem   with me or with you?",9,Friends,258,50
53035,Chandler,21, Actually it's both of us.,9,Friends,26,5
53036,Monica,21, What?,9,Friends,6,1
53037,Chandler,21, Apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable   environment.,9,Friends,82,12
53038,Monica,21, Oh... what does that mean?,9,Friends,27,5
53039,Chandler,21, It means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers and   you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do.  It means...,9,Friends,136,26
53040,Monica,21, Chandler?,9,Friends,10,1

53042,Monica,21,  Oh my God!,9,Friends,12,3
53043,Chandler,21, I'm sorry.,9,Friends,11,2

53064,Joey,92, Oh hey Rach!,9,Friends,13,3

53067,Rachel,92," Oh, well...",9,Friends,12,2
53069,Joey,92," Are you kidding? Rachel loves to shop! And she has great taste! Yeah, she's the one who taught me, you don't wear white after labour day and that you always, always, always have to put on underwear when you're trying on clothes.",9,Friends,229,42
53071,Rachel,92," Ok, uh-uh... Let's-Let's shop!!",9,Friends,32,4

53098,Monica,92,  Ok.,9,Friends,5,1
53100,Chandler,92," Is that a hint? Because we love you Doctor Connelly but we don't think we'd want you to be our child!  Wow, talking about an inhospitable environment!",9,Friends,151,27

53128,Joey,92," All right, so. How did it go at the fertility clinic?",9,Friends,54,11
53129,Chandler,92, Not as much fun as last time. Apparently you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample.,9,Friends,92,18
53130,Ross,92, So-so what did the doctor say?,9,Friends,31,6
53131,Chandler,92," Well... there's surrogacy, but Monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her.",9,Friends,154,27
53132,Joey,92, So you're ruling out surrogacy?,9,Friends,32,5
53133,Chandler,92, Yeah.,9,Friends,6,1
53134,Joey,92," So, I don't have to learn what that means?",9,Friends,43,9
53135,Chandler,92," Aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we're talking about sperm donors.",9,Friends,99,15
53136,Joey,92," Enough said, I'm there for you man. Where is she, upstairs?",9,Friends,60,11
53137,Chandler,92,  ah-ha!,9,Friends,8,1
53138,Ross,92, How do you feel about all this?,9,Friends,32,7
53139,Chandler,92, I wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but I don't think there is one.,9,Friends,86,20
53140,Joey,92," Come on Ross, be a good guy. Step up and do it!",9,Friends,48,12
53141,Ross,92,  What?,9,Friends,7,1
53142,Ross,92,  What? NO! I am not going to give them Ben!,9,Friends,44,10
53144,Ross,92, The data we are receiving from MRI scans and DNA testing of these fossils are - are staggering.,9,Friends,96,18
53146,Ross,92,"  I mean, we've been accepting Leakey's dates as a given, but if they're off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can - you can just throw most of our assumptions, you know, right in the trash.  So-so what I am saying is - is is that  is that the repercussions could be huge! I mean, not just in palaeontology, but if-if you think about it, in evolutionary biology, uh, genetics, geology, uh, I mean, truly the mind boggles!",9,Friends,435,82
53147,Ross,92," Oh, that's not what you want...",9,Friends,32,6
53151,Rachel,92," Pheebs, that's for men!",9,Friends,24,4
53155,Rachel,92," On Melanie Griffith in ""Working girl"". I think what you want is over here.",9,Friends,75,14

53161,Rachel,92," Yeah! I'm a big fan! Of the movies, you know. Motion pictures. The Talkies!",9,Friends,76,14
53163,Rachel,92, Sure!,9,Friends,6,1
53166,Rachel,92, You know that depends on what it is! I've done a lot of stuff.,9,Friends,63,14
53168,Rachel,92," She's ok, I just don't get a really good vibe from her!",9,Friends,56,12
53170,Rachel,92," I don't know, you know, just the way she waltzed in here all smart, and tall! You know, and just swept Joey off his feet... I mean, nobody else has a chance!",9,Friends,158,32
53172,Rachel,92," Anybody! You, me, you know, Monica's mom...",9,Friends,44,7
53174,Rachel,92," Shhhhh! Phoebe! All right, look. I have a little thing for him.",9,Friends,64,12
53176,Rachel,92," It's just physical and I have it totally under control! Ok? It's just, when I see them together, sometimes I just get a little jealous!",9,Friends,136,25
53178,Rachel,92,"  Oh, I get it!",9,Friends,15,4
53180,Rachel,92," I know, I know, so it is just not a big deal.",9,Friends,46,12

53190,Monica,92," Oh, of course, it's so nice to see you again, Zack!",9,Friends,52,11
53192,Chandler,92," You guys haven't actually met before, but, boy! You're both polite!  Go to have a seat Zack, and I'll get you a beer.",9,Friends,118,23
